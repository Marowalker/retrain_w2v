Thiopurine drugs are widely used
as antileukemic drugs and immunosuppressive
agents, and 6-thioguanosine triphosphate (SGTP) is a major
metabolite for these drugs. Recent studies have suggested that thiopurine
drugs may exert their cytotoxic effects partly through binding of SGTP to a GTP-binding protein, Rac1. However, it remains unclear
whether SGTP can also bind to other cellular proteins.
Here, we introduced an orthogonal approach, encompassing nucleotide-affinity
profiling and nucleotide-binding competition assays, to characterize
comprehensively SGTP-binding proteins along with the specific
binding sites from the entire human proteome. With the simultaneous
use of SGTP and GTP affinity probes, we identified 165 SGTP-binding proteins that are involved in several different
biological processes. We also examined the binding selectivities of
these proteins toward SGTP and GTP, which allowed for the
revelation of the relative binding affinities of the two nucleotides
toward the nucleotide-binding motif sequence of proteins. Our results
suggest that SGTP mainly targets GTPases, with strong binding
affinities observed for multiple heterotrimeric G proteins. We also
demonstrated that SGTP binds to several cyclin-dependent
kinases (CDKs), which may perturb the CDK-mediated phosphorylation
and cell cycle progression. Together, this represents the first comprehensive
characterization of SGTP-binding property for the entire
human proteome. We reason that a similar strategy can be generally
employed for the future characterization of the interaction of other
modified nucleotides with the global proteome.

Thiopurine
drugs, including
6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, and azathioprine, are widely used
as cancer therapeutic and immunosuppressive agents.1 Although the exact mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic
effects of these thiopurines remain elusive, it is generally accepted
that thiopurines are pro-drugs and require metabolic activation to
exert their toxicity. After cellular uptake, the thiopurine drugs
can be metabolically activated to yield 6-thioguanosine triphosphate
(SGTP) and 6-thio-2′-deoxyguanosine triphosphate,
which can be incorporated into RNA or DNA.2 In this vein, it was proposed that DNA 6-thioguanine may be spontaneously
methylated by (S)-adenosyl-l-methionine
to give (S6)-methylthioguanine (S6mG), which directs the misincorporation of
dTMP during DNA replication.3 The resulting S6mG:T mispair can trigger the postreplicative
mismatch repair (MMR) pathway, thereby inducing cell death.4

The triggering of the MMR pathway may not
be the sole mechanism
contributing to the cytotoxic effects of the thiopurine drugs considering
the fact that the MMR-deficient leukemia cells were also sensitive
toward thiopurines.5 In this context, 6-thioguanine
was found to reactivate epigenetically silenced genes in leukemia
cells by inducing DNMT1 degradation,6 and
6-thioguanine could also induce mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive
oxygen species generation in cultured human cells.7,8 In
addition, SGTP, a thiopurine metabolite, was shown to block
the activation of Rac1, a GTP-binding protein, in human T lymphocytes,
which leads to the inactivation of its target genes such as MEK, NF-κB,
and Bcl-xL and the induction of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.9,10 Considering the involvement of a variety of nucleotide-binding proteins
such as protein kinases11 and small GTPases12 in cell signaling, investigation of the interaction
of SGTP with cellular nucleotide-binding proteins may unveil
the novel mechanisms of action of the thiopurine drugs.

Currently
there is no proteome-wide characterization of cellular
proteins that can recognize SGTP. Traditional studies on
nucleotide–protein interaction often rely on the radioactivity-based
ultrafiltration assay13 or the fluorescence-based
binding assay.14 These methods are usually
costly and time-consuming because they require the use of purified
proteins. Moreover, none of these approaches permit the robust discovery
of a nucleotide-binding site, or “nucleotide-interacting residues”,
in proteins. Recently, we developed a quantitative affinity profiling
strategy, encompassing the use of low and high concentrations of desthiobiotin-conjugated
acyl ATP probes, to comprehensively characterize ATP–protein
interactions at the entire proteome scale.15 The method allows for the minimization of false-positive identification
of ATP-binding targets arising from nonspecific labeling and facilitates
the identification of previously unrecognized ATP-binding sites in
ATP-binding proteins.

Here, we devised a quantitative profiling
strategy with the use
of a SGTP-affinity probe to unambiguously discover novel SGTP-binding proteins along with the specific binding sites
from the entire human proteome. Additionally, we characterized the
binding selectivities of these proteins toward SGTP and
GTP. Many known GTP-binding proteins, including multiple heterotrimeric
G proteins, exhibit a strong binding preference toward SGTP. We also observed that SGTP displays robust binding
toward multiple cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which may perturb
the CDK-mediated phosphorylation and cell cycle progression.

Experimental
Procedures
Synthesis of 6-Thioguanosine Triphosphate
All reagents
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise indicated. 6-Thioguanosine
was phosphorylated to give the corresponding 5′-monophosphate
following published procedures.16 A reaction
mixture containing 6-thioguanosine-5′-monophosphate (225 mg,
0.6 mmol), triphenylphosphine (0.396 g, 1.5 mmol), diphenyl thioether
(0.33 g, 1.5 mmol), and l-methylimidazole (0.5 mL, 6.2 mmol)
in DMF/DMSO (1:2, 10 mL) was incubated at room temperature for 15
min. To the resulting solution was subsequently added 0.5 M bis(tri-n-butylammonium) pyrophosphate in DMF (1.5 mmol, 3.0 mL).17 The solution mixture was incubated at room temperature
for 50 min, and the product was precipitated by the addition of acetone
(100 mL). The precipitate was washed twice with acetone (20 mL each).
The product was subsequently purified by using an anion exchange column
packed with DEAE Sephadex G-25, and the SGTP was eluted
with 200 mM NH4HCO3. Fractions were pooled,
lyophilized, dissolved in water, and lyophilized again to give SGTP as a white solid (54 mg, yield 17%). 1H NMR
(D2O, 300 MHz): δ 8.13 (s, 1H), 5.82 (s, 1H), 4.65
(s, 1H), 4.51–4.46 (m, 1H), 4.23 (brs, 1H), 4.12–4.08
(m, 2H). 31P NMR (D2O, 80 MHz): δ −8.5,
−10.2, −21.7.

Cell Lysate Preparation and Labeling with
the Nucleotide Affinity
Probe
The desthiobiotinylated SGTP and GTP affinity
probes (Figure 1) were prepared following previously
published procedures15,18 with minor modifications (see Supporting Information). The nucleotide affinity
probes are not highly stable at room temperature; thus, the probes
were stored at −80 °C until use, and, prior to the binding
and labeling experiment, the integrities of the probes were always
analyzed by ESI-MS to ensure that there is no evident degradation.
For stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)
experiments, lysine/arginine-depleted RPMI-1640 medium (Pierce) was
supplemented with light or heavy ([13C6,15N2]-l-lysine and [13C6]-l-arginine) lysine and arginine, along with dialyzed
FBS (Invitrogen) and penicillin (100 IU/mL) to give the complete SILAC
medium. The Jurkat-T acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (ATCC; Manassas,
VA) were cultured in heavy RPMI-1640 SILAC medium for at least five
cell doublings to achieve complete isotope incorporation. Cells were
maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37
°C. Approximately 2 × 107 cells were harvested,
washed with cold PBS for three times, and lysed in a 1 mL lysis buffer,
which contained 0.7% CHAPS, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5 mM EDTA, 100
mM NaCl, and 10 μL (1:100) protease inhibitor cocktail on ice
for 30 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 16 000g at 4 °C for 30 min, and the resulting supernatants
were collected and subjected to gel filtration separation using NAP-25
columns (Amersham Biosciences) to remove free endogenous nucleotides.
Cell lysates were eluted into a 2 mL buffer, containing 50 mM HEPES
(pH 7.4), 75 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol. Most endogenous nucleotides
should be removed with this approach, though we cannot exclude the
possibility that the tightly bound nucleotides from some GTP-binding
proteins are not removed with this approach, which may limit their
binding toward the GTP or SGTP affinity probe. The resulting
proteins in cell lysates were quantified using Quick Start Bradford
Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and stored at −80 °C.
Immediately prior to the labeling reaction, MgCl2, MnCl2, and CaCl2 were added to the concentrated cell
lysate until their final concentrations reached 50, 5, and 5 mM, respectively.
It is worth noting that divalent metal ions (e.g., Mg2+) are often important in protein-GTP binding;19 thus, divalent metal ions were added to assist the binding
of nucleotide affinity probes to nucleotide-binding proteins. Approximately
1 mg of cell lysate was treated with 10 or 100 μM desthiobiotin-SGTP or -GTP affinity probe. Labeling reactions were carried
out at room temperature with gentle shaking for 1.5 h. After the reaction,
the remaining probes in the cell lysates were removed by buffer exchange
with 25 mM NH4HCO3 (pH 8.5) using Amicon Ultra-4
filter (10 000 NMWL, Millipore).

In-Solution Enzymatic Digestion and Affinity Purification
After addition of 8 M urea for protein denaturation, as well as
dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide for cysteine reduction and alkylation,
the labeled proteins were digested with modified sequencing-grade
trypsin (Roche Applied Science) at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:100
in 25 mM NH4HCO3 (pH 8.5) at 37 °C for
overnight. The peptide mixture was subsequently dried in a Speed-vac
and redissolved in 1 mL of 100 mM potassium phosphate and 0.15 M NaCl
(pH 7.5, PBS buffer), to which solution was subsequently added 200
μL of avidin-agarose resin (Sigma-Aldrich). The mixture was
incubated at 25 °C for 1 h with gentle shaking. The agarose resin
was then washed with 3 mL of PBS and 3 mL of H2O to remove
unbound peptides, and the labeled peptides were subsequently eluted
with 1% TFA in CH3CN/H2O (7:3, v/v) at 65 °C.
The eluates were dried in a Speed-vac and stored at −20 °C
prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. The detailed conditions for LC-MS/MS and
in vitro kinase activity assay, and database search parameters are
described in the online Supporting Information.

Results
Strategy for Proteome-Wide Characterization
of SGTP–Protein
Interactions
Here, we extended the use of biotin-labeled
nucleotide affinity probes as acylating agents to selectively label
and enrich SGTP-binding proteins from the entire human
proteome. Similar to the previously reported ATP or GTP affinity probes,18 the SGTP affinity probe harbors a
binding moiety (SGTP) and an enrichment moiety (i.e., desthiobiotin)
that are conjugated through an acyl phosphate linkage (Figure 1). Upon binding to proteins, the acyl phosphate
component of the affinity probe reacts with the ε-amino group
of the specific lysine residue at the nucleotide-binding site to yield
a stable amide bond, which results in the covalent attachment of desthiobiotin
to the lysine residue on SGTP-binding proteins (Figure S1A). In this vein, it is of note that
the presence of the desthiobiotin moiety on the γ phosphate
is not expected to affect the binding of the probe to nucleotide-binding
proteins, viewing that γ phosphate generally interacts with
hydrophilic, solvent-exposable regions of the nucleotide-binding proteins.19

Owing to its relatively high reactivity,
lysine residues not involved in nucleotide binding may also be modified
by the nucleotide affinity probe via nonspecific electrostatic interactions.
To distinguish specific from nonspecific labeling, we applied a nucleotide
affinity profiling strategy developed previously in our lab15 utilizing high and low concentrations of SGTP affinity probe, along with SILAC-based quantitative proteomics
platform,20 to unambiguously characterize SGTP-binding affinities of proteins at the entire proteome
scale. Along this line, the binding of the SGTP component
of the probe to a protein promotes the acyl phosphate moiety to couple
with the lysine residue at the nucleotide binding site.21 Therefore, lysine residues involved with SGTP binding and those that are not would exhibit distinct
labeling behaviors with low and high concentrations of the SGTP affinity probe. At low probe concentration (10 μM), the
former lysine residues possess high reactivity and are completely
labeled and the latter are partially labeled because of the limited
amount of labeling reagent present; however, at high probe concentration
(100 μM), both types of lysines are labeled to almost completion.
These two probe concentrations were chosen on the basis of our previous
study with the use of GTP affinity probe, where we observed a 4-fold
reduction in the identification of the number of GTP-binding proteins
when the concentration of the GTP probe was decreased from 100 to
15 μM.18 In addition, a relatively
large percentage of the probe-labeled peptides were derived from nonspecific
proteins when the probe concentration was at 100 μM.18 Thus, we selected 10 and 100 μM probe
concentrations for the nucleotide affinity profiling experiment to
optimize the sensitivity and selectivity for the identification of SGTP-binding proteins.

After labeling the light and heavy
SILAC cell lysates with 10 and
100 μM of the probe, respectively (forward SILAC, and the labeling
experiment was also carried out in an opposite way in reverse SILAC,
Figure 2), we combined the two protein samples,
digested the protein mixture with trypsin, enriched the resulting
desthiobiotin-labeled peptides with avidin agarose, and subjected
the enriched peptides to LC-MS/MS analyses. The peak intensity ratios
of desthiobiotin-labeled light and heavy peptides were then employed
to derive SGTP-binding affinity ratio, RSGTP10/1, for specific lysine residues in individual proteins
(Figure 2), where specific SGTP-binding
lysine will display an RSGTP10/1 close
to 1, because a similar amount of SGTP-binding lysine will
be labeled regardless of the probe concentration. By contrast, nonspecifically
labeled lysine will show a concentration-dependent increase in SGTP probe labeling, which will yield an RSGTP10/1 ≫1. It is of note that owing to the aforementioned
practical limitation about probe concentrations which can be used
(10 and 100 μM), we cannot formally exclude the possibility
that some highly abundant SGTP-binding proteins may still
exhibit large ratios of RSGTP10/1, thereby
resulting in their false-negative identification.

Figure 2 Comprehensive characterization
of SGTP-binding proteins
by orthogonal quantitative SGTP-affinity profiling assay
and SGTP/GTP competition assay.

Although the above-proposed SGTP affinity profiling
assay is effective in identifying specific SGTP-binding
proteins, it provides little information about the binding selectivities
of these proteins toward SGTP versus other endogenous nucleotides
(i.e., ATP and GTP). To address this, we also employed SILAC together
with our SGTP and GTP affinity probes to compare directly
the SGTP- and GTP-binding affinities of proteins at the
entire proteome scale. In this experiment, light- and heavy-labeled
cell lysates were treated with 100 μM each of desthiobiotin-based SGTP and GTP probes, respectively, and, to minimize the bias
introduced by SILAC, we also conducted the labeling experiments in
the opposite way (i.e., reverse SILAC experiment). After the reaction,
light- and heavy-labeled cell lysates were mixed prior to any further
steps of sample manipulation as described above. Peak intensity ratios
of light and heavy desthiobiotin-labeled tryptic peptides were subsequently
used to derive SGTP/GTP binding affinity ratio, RSGTP/GTP, which reflects the relative binding
affinities of SGTP and GTP toward specific lysine residues
in proteins of interest.

Proteome-Wide Profiling of SGTP-Binding
Proteins
Our quantitative SGTP-affinity profiling
of whole cell
lysate from Jurkat-T cells led to the quantification of a total of
1925 proteins, which include more than 5400 light or heavy desthiobiotin-modified
lysine residues. As depicted in Figure 3A,
a large number of peptides with desthiobiotin modification exhibited
significantly different probe labeling efficiency when 10 and 100
μM of probe were employed for the labeling reactions, with RSGTP10/1 ≫ 1. However, a small portion
of the desthiobiotin-modified peptides bear RSGTP10/1 close to 1, indicating that they possess comparable
labeling efficiency at low and high probe concentrations. Similar
to the previous quantitative affinity profiling assays for ATP-binding
proteins15 and reactive cysteine-containing
proteins,22 we arbitrarily consider lysine
residue in peptides with RSGTP10/1 <
2 as SGTP-binding lysine. With this threshold, the identified SGTP-binding proteins are at least 5-fold more selective toward
binding the modified nucleotide than those proteins that were labeled
via nonspecific binding. In addition, only those modified lysine residues
that were successfully quantified at least twice are retained on the
list. With these criteria, we obtained 199 unique desthiobiotin-modified
peptides, representing approximately 4% of total identified peptides,
from 165 unique proteins. We considered these 165 proteins as SGTP-binding proteins (Table S1).

cell lysates with low (10 μM) and high (100 μM) concentrations
of SGTP probe in SGTP-affinity profiling assay.
(B) Molecular function GO analysis for proteins with different RSGTP10/1 ratios using Jurkat-T cell lysates.
(C) Biological process GO analysis for targeted SGTP-binding
proteins.

Owing to the structural similarity
of SGTP and GTP,
the SGTP affinity probe may also bind to and conjugate
with GTP-binding proteins. We surveyed the 165 identified SGTP-binding targets for their functional characteristics using DAVID,23 which revealed that 19% of the 165 proteins
are with the known GTP-binding gene ontology (GO), suggesting an 8.4-fold
enrichment relative to the entire human proteome with a p-value of 8.1 × 10–20 (Figure 3B and Table S2). In contrast, the
percentage of known GTP-binding proteins in the protein group containing
peptides with RSGTP10/1 > 2 is only
3%.
More significantly, among the 199 peptides from the candidate SGTP-binding protein group, peptides from known GTP-binding
proteins were on average identified and quantified 2–3 times
more frequently than those from proteins lacking GTP-binding GO, suggesting
an even more pronounced GTP-binding enrichment efficiency (44% of
all quantification events, Table S1). Additionally,
we found that 56 out of 165 (34%) identified SGTP-binding
proteins are known ATP-binding proteins, indicating a 3.4-fold enrichment
relative to the entire human proteome with a p-value
of 1.5 × 10–15. However, in contrast to the
GTP-binding protein group, a large percentage of known ATP-binding
proteins with desthiobiotin labeling identified in our profiling experiment
were excluded from SGTP-binding protein groups (Figure 3B and Table S2). Only
18% (56 out of a total of 318) of the identified known ATP-binding
proteins are SGTP-binding proteins, suggesting the necessity
in revealing nonspecific probe labeling arising from electrostatic
interaction based on the RSGTP10/1 ratio.
Thus, SGTP targets a wide array of known GTP- and ATP-binding
proteins.

GO analysis also unveiled a strong enrichment of multiple
GTP-related
pathways including translational elongation, protein transport and
localization, and small GTPase-mediated signal transduction (Figure 3C). This is in keeping with the over-representation
of GTP-binding GO of SGTP-binding targets, suggesting that SGTP may interfere significantly with the GTP-related cell
function. For example, GTP serves as an important cofactor for elongation
factors 1 and 2 to regulate the GTP hydrolysis-dependent translocation
of peptidyl-tRNA during translation elongation.24 Our results showed that SGTP binds to elongation
factors 1-alpha, 1-alpha2, and 2, which may affect the GTP-related
regulatory mechanism of protein synthesis. Interestingly, we also
observed the over-representation of “cell cycle” process
(Figure 3C), where more than 20 proteins involved
in this process, including multiple CDKs, were found to be SGTP-binding proteins. These results offer a wealth of information
for the further examination of SGTP–protein interaction
and the mechanism of action of thiopurine drugs.

Competitive
Binding of SGTP/GTP to Known GTPases
As mentioned
above, our nucleotide affinity profiling strategy
differs from other nucleotide-binding assays by virtue of its capability
in site-specific differentiation of nucleotide binding. Benefited
from this high-throughput, proteome-wide quantitative analysis, we
sought to analyze the sequence context surrounding the desthiobiotin-modified
lysine, which is considered as the SGTP-binding site in
proteins. In this regard, we included all the desthiobiotin-labeled
peptides with RSGTP10/1 ratios being smaller
than 2 for motif search using motif-X.25 This led to the discovery of the well-known P-loop sequence motif
of GxxxxGKS,26 with a 91-fold enrichment
relative to the occurrence frequency of this motif in the entire proteome
(Figure 4A). This finding suggests that SGTP directly competes with GTP in binding toward protein targets
at exactly the same nucleotide-binding site at the P-loop region.
Therefore, our SGTP affinity profiling assay and SGTP/GTP competition assay could allow for site-specific determination
of the SGTP binding affinity and selectivity toward the
unique P-loop motif sequence, which is known to be directly involved
in GTP-binding for these GTPases. On the basis of the results from SGTP affinity profiling assay and SGTP/GTP competition
assay, we constructed a heatmap to better visualize the SGTP binding affinity and selectivity for 34 quantified GTPases toward
the unique P-loop binding motif (Figure 4B).
The heatmap showed that the GxxxxGKS motif in most known GTP-binding
proteins, including small GTPases, heterotrimeric G proteins, and
several other GTP-binding proteins (i.e., elongation factor 1-alpha
2, GTP-binding proteins 1 and 2), exhibited significant binding preference
toward SGTP.

Figure 4 (A) Unique binding motifs found for the identified SGTP-binding proteins in the SGTP affinity profiling
experiment.
(B) A heatmap displaying the SGTP-binding affinity and SGTP/GTP binding selectivity toward GxxxxGKS binding motif
of known GTPases. For the SGTP affinity profiling heatmap,
dark blue and white designate high SGTP-binding affinity
with small RSGTP10/1 ratios and low SGTP-binding affinity with large RSGTP10/1 ratios, respectively; for the SGTP/GTP competition binding
heatmap, dark red and dark green indicate significant GTP-binding
preference with low RSGTP/GTP ratio and
similar SGTP/GTP-binding preference (i.e., with RSGTP/GTP ratio close to unity), respectively
(see scale bar below the heatmap). Gray represents those GTPases that
were not quantified.

Small GTPases are structurally classified into at least five
families,
namely, the Ras, Rho, Rab, Sar1/Arf, and Ran families.12 Like other G proteins, small GTPases exist in
the interconvertible GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active forms.
The regulation of the activity of small GTPases plays vital roles
in cell signaling, and loss of such regulation is believed to be closely
associated with the development of various types of cancer.27 Our results led to the quantification of most
small GTPases, including 14 Rab proteins, with their GxxxxGKS motif
displaying significant binding preference toward SGTP.
For instance, the desthiobiotin-labeled peptide from the P-loop motif
of Rab11b, namely, VVLIGDSGVGK24#SNLLSR, was detected in
our SGTP affinity profiling experiment with a significant SGTP binding affinity (RSGTP10/1 ratio = 1.39, Figure 5A,B).

It is worth
noting that several small GTPases (i.e., Ras-related
protein Rab-14, RAS oncogene-family-like 4, Rho-related GTP-binding
protein RhoC, and GTP-binding protein SAR1a) displayed low SGTP binding affinity. Although P-loop motif sequence from these small
GTPases can still be labeled with the SGTP probe, relatively
large RSGTP10/1 ratios were observed for
these peptides, suggesting their low binding affinity toward SGTP. Moreover, our SGTP/GTP competition assay revealed
that small GTPase-related pathways may not be the major targets for SGTP. As shown in Figure 4B, most small
GTPases exhibit stronger binding to GTP than SGTP. This
result suggests that, owing to the competition from binding to endogenous
GTP, SGTP may not affect substantially the small GTPase-related
cell function in vivo. This finding is reminiscent of a previous observation
that, although SGTP is capable of binding to eight small
GTPases like Ran protein, much higher concentrations of SGTP were required to displace the bound GTP from these small GTPases.10

Four heterotrimeric G proteins display
significant binding affinity
toward SGTP (Figure 5). For instance,
one desthiobiotin-labeled peptide with a P-loop motif from guanine
nucleotide-binding protein G(olf) subunit alpha (GNAL) (i.e., LLLLGAGESGK55#STIVK) was successfully quantified in both forward and reverse SGTP affinity profiling assay, where K55 consistently displays
a low RSGTP10/1 of 1.46 (Figure 5E,F). This result suggests that GNAL may bind to SGTP, with K55 being directly involved in nucleotide binding.
Different from what we found for small GTPases, P-loop regions of
all heterotrimeric G proteins quantified in our experiments exhibited
similar binding selectivities toward SGTP and GTP. For
instance, the aforementioned K55 from GNAL can be effectively labeled
by GTP and SGTP probes at similar efficiency, suggesting
the similar binding affinity of this protein to these two nucleotides
(Figure 5G,H). The finding that SGTP competes with GTP in binding multiple heterotrimeric G proteins
indicates that SGTP may affect heterotrimeric G-protein-mediated
signaling. The signal amplitude of the G-protein-related pathway is
a dynamic interplay of GDP/GTP exchange (activation) and GTP hydrolysis
(deactivation), where the GDP-bound inactive form of heterotrimeric
G proteins interact with membrane-bound G protein-coupled receptors.28 The competitive binding of SGTP instead
of GTP to Gα subunit may block G protein activation by inhibiting
Gα release. In addition, the loading of SGTP to Gα
may lead to the accumulation of SGTP-bound, active form
or SGDP-bound, inactive form of G proteins over time; either
scenario may perturb G-protein-mediated signaling.

Competitive Binding of SGTP to Multiple CDKs
Aside from the various GTPases, we also made an interesting discovery
that SGTP can bind to multiple CDKs. CDKs are serine/threonine
kinases that become active only when coupled with specific types of
cyclins. These CDKs and their activating cyclins (A, B, D, and E)
are key regulators in mammalian cell cycle progression.29 For instance, CDK4/cyclin D and CDK2/cyclin
E/A promote the passage through G1 and S phases, whereas CDK1/cyclin
B, as the only nonredundant cell cycle driver, regulates the transition
through late G2 and mitosis.30 Malfunction
of CDKs, especially their hyperactivation may induce unregulated proliferation
of cancer cells. Thus, CDKs are attractive targets for cancer therapy,
and multiple CDK inhibitors have been introduced as anticancer drugs
for preclinical and clinical evaluation.31

Intriguingly, our SGTP affinity profiling results
showed that CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK5, CDK6 can bind strongly to SGTP, with all RSGTP10/1 being
<2. Moreover, we found that SGTP binds to the same binding
motif (i.e., the HRD motif) in these CDKs as ATP.15 For instance, we successfully detected probe-labeled K147
located in the HRD motif of CDK6 (Figure 6A,B).
In addition, results from SGTP/GTP competition experiment
toward this unique ATP-binding HRD motif sequence indicate that CDK1
(RSGTP/GTP = 0.51), CDK2 (RSGTP/GTP = 0.85), CDK5 (RSGTP/GTP = 0.88) have similar nucleotide-binding preference between GTP and SGTP, whereas CDK4 (RSGTP/GTP =
3.33) and CDK6 (RSGTP/GTP = 3.85) display
much stronger binding toward SGTP than GTP (Figure 6C,D). It is worth noting that CDK4 and CDK6 belong
to the same D-type cyclin-dependent kinase group, which bind to and
are activated by cyclin D.32 The structural
and functional similarities of CDK4 and CDK6 are consistent with their
comparable SGTP binding property, as revealed by the aforementioned SGTP affinity profiling experiment.

of CDKs, it is possible that CDKs may be able to employ SGTP, in a similar manner as ATP, as phosphate donor to phosphorylate
its substrate proteins, which may not perturb the functions of CDKs.
To examine this possibility, we performed an in vitro kinase activity
assay using purified CDK6 and a synthetic peptide EGLPT821PTKMTPPFR, derived from retinoblastoma-associated protein (Rb), which
is a known CDK6 substrate.33 Mass spectrometry
was employed to detect the phosphorylated substrate peptide. Our results
showed that, in the presence of ATP, CDK6/cyclin D can successfully
phosphorylate the substrate peptide with the signal ratio for phosphorylated/unmodified
peptide being ∼7% (Figure 7A). Furthermore,
the MS/MS supports the phosphorylation of Thr821 in the substrate
peptide (Figure S2), which is consistent
with previous finding.34 However, when
the same in vitro kinase activity assay of CDK6 was conducted using
GTP or SGTP to replace ATP as the phosphate donor, no phosphorylated
peptide was observed. These results suggest that, although SGTP displays robust binding toward CDK6, CDK6 can only employ ATP
as the phosphate donor to phosphorylate the Rb protein. Therefore,
we further assessed the inhibitory effect of SGTP for CDK6
phosphorylation by conducting the same in vitro phosphorylation reaction
with constant ATP concentration along with increasing amounts of SGTP. A significant inhibitory effect of CDK6 phosphorylation
by SGTP binding was observed. As shown in Figure 7B, around 50% and 80% inhibition in CDK6 phosphorylation
was observed when SGTP/ATP concentration ratios reached
1/2 and 1/1, respectively, whereas no phosphorylation was observed
when the ratio was 2/1. Therefore, our results suggest that the competitive
binding of SGTP to multiple CDKs may not only affect their
binding toward endogenous ATP but also greatly affect the phosphorylation
efficiency of the kinases. Thus, the SGTP introduced by
thiopurine drug treatment may exert a profound effect on CDK activity,
which may ultimately affect cell cycle progression.

Conclusions
Here, we introduced an orthogonal strategy
encompassing the nucleotide
affinity profiling assay and nucleotide binding competition assay
to comprehensively characterize, at the entire proteome scale, SGTP-binding proteins. With the simultaneous use of SGTP and GTP affinity probes, 165 proteins involved in different biological
processes were determined to be SGTP-binding targets. In
addition, the selectivity between SGTP- and GTP-binding
for these SGTP targets was further characterized. Unlike
traditional binding competition assay, our SGTP/GTP binding
selectivity was determined from the binding preference of SGTP/GTP toward the verified nucleotide-binding motif sequence, which
provides superior specificity and accuracy. Our results suggest that SGTP mainly targets GTPases and affects various GTPase-mediated
signaling pathways. Especially, SGTP exhibits strong binding
affinity toward multiple heterotrimeric G proteins. Furthermore, we
demonstrated for the first time that SGTP binds to multiple
CDKs, which may perturb the CDK-mediated phosphorylation and cell
cycle progression.

Nucleotides are susceptible to damage through
exposure to various
genotoxic agents, including reactive oxygen species generated from
normal metabolism or from exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental
chemicals.35 For example, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine
triphosphate (8-oxoGTP) could be produced at appreciable levels in
the cytoplasm.36 Some damaged nucleotides
may be incorporated into RNA or DNA, thereby perturbing the flow of
genetic information. Alternatively, damaged nucleotides may be recognized
by certain cellular proteins to perturb relevant cellular functions.
The analytical strategy presented here should be generally applicable
for quantitative studies of proteins that can bind to 8-oxoGTP and
any other damaged nucleotides at the whole proteome scale. Such studies
should also result in the discovery of specific proteins that can
bind to these damaged nucleotides and how these proteins recognize
the damaged nucleotides versus their endogenous undamaged counterparts.
