An optimized peptide substrate was
used to measure protein kinase
B (PKB) activity in single cells. The peptide substrate was introduced
into single cells, and capillary electrophoresis was used to separate
and quantify nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated peptide. The system
was validated in three model pancreatic cancer cell lines before being
applied to primary cells from human pancreatic adenocarcinomas propagated
in nude mice. As measured by phosphorylation of peptide substrate,
each tumor cell line exhibited statistically different median levels
of PKB activity (65%, 21%, and 4% phosphorylation in PANC-1 (human
pancreatic carcinoma), CFPAC-1 (human metastatic ductal pancreatic
adenocarcinoma), and HPAF-II cells (human pancreatic adenocarcinoma),
respectively) with CFPAC-1 cells demonstrating two populations of
cells or bimodal behavior in PKB activation levels. The primary cells
exhibited highly variable PKB activity at the single cell level, with
some cells displaying little to no activity and others possessing
very high levels of activity. This system also enabled simultaneous
characterization of peptidase action in single cells by measuring
the amount of cleaved peptide substrate in each cell. The tumor cell
lines displayed degradation rates statistically similar to one another
(0.02, 0.06, and 0.1 zmol pg–1 s–1, for PANC-1, CFPAC-1, and HPAF-II cells, respectively) while the
degradation rate in primary cells was 10-fold slower. The peptide
cleavage sites also varied between tissue-cultured and primary cells,
with 5- and 8-residue fragments formed in tumor cell lines and only
the 8-residue fragment formed in primary cells. These results demonstrate
the ability of chemical cytometry to identify important differences
in enzymatic behavior between primary cells and tissue-cultured cell
lines.

==== Body
Pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDA) accounts for greater than 90% of all types of pancreatic cancer
and is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the
United States.1−4 PDA generally develops in adults over 50 years old adjacent to the
pancreatic duct, often leading to blockage of the pancreatic or bile
ducts. PDA tumors frequently invade deep into the pancreas and nearby
organs and rapidly metastasize to the lymph nodes prior to diagnosis.5,6 The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be approximately
45,220 new cases of PDA and 38,460 deaths from PDA in the United States
in 2013.5 Median survival for patients
diagnosed early (Stage I) is approximately 2 years, but greater than
50% of individuals are not diagnosed until the late stages, when the
median survival decreases to 4.5 months.5 Treatment for patients with PDA includes surgical removal of the
cancer (approximately 20% of patients) as well as radiation and chemotherapy,
though these measures usually only relieve symptoms and may briefly
extend survival. Only rarely does treatment yield a cure.5

Genetic alterations, including mutations,
deletions, and amplifications,
of up to 12 different signaling pathways and processes have been found
in most pancreatic cancers, including PDA.7 Among the pathways affected are those that control apoptosis, DNA
damage control, and tumor invasion, all of which enable PDA tumors
to survive and proliferate even in the presence of anticancer therapies.8,9 Prominent among these altered pathways is the PI3-K (phosphoinositide
3-kinase) pathway, which regulates multiple cellular functions, including
transcription, proliferation, stress response, and apoptosis.10,11 Protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt) is a serine/threonine
kinase in the PI3-K pathway whose activity has been implicated in
providing cancer cells with antiapoptotic properties, even in the
presence of multiple apoptotic stimuli.8 This is particularly true in PDA, where the PI3-K/PKB pathway has
been found to be constitutively active and appears to be an indicator
of aggressiveness of the pancreatic cancer, with high levels of active
PKB associated with decreased patient survival.12−16 While 10% of analyzed pancreatic carcinomas show
an amplification of AKT2 (one of 3 PKB genes), no other genetic alterations
have been reported for PKB or PI3-K in pancreatic tumors, suggesting
that alterations to the pathway are occurring by misregulation of
mRNA, protein levels, or input from other pathways.2,17 Thus,
PKB gene copy number and protein levels often do not predict the level
of PKB activity in a tumor. Consequently, a strategy to directly measure
PKB activity in PDA tumors would be of high utility in understanding
PKB signaling in PDA.

Currently, the most commonly utilized
measurement of PKB in resected
PDA tumors is Western blot analysis, in which the amount of active
PKB is determined using antibodies directed against phosphorylated
PKB.2 However, this method reports the
population-averaged level of PKB activity and yields no insight into
tumor heterogeneity at the cellular level. It has long been known
that tumors are highly heterogeneous, with differences arising from
genetic, protein, and metabolic diversity.18−20 By nature,
bulk measurements cannot reveal these differences, whereas interrogation
of single cells has the power to yield a wealth of information on
single-cell dynamics. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) measurement of phosphorylated
PKB has been used to assess PKB activity at the single-cell level.2,12,14,15 Although IHC is valuable for determining subcellular localization
of active PKB in PDA tumor cells, it is not quantitative. In contrast,
chemical cytometry,21 which utilizes sensitive
analytical techniques to gather quantitative data from individual
cells, provides a direct single-cell quantitative measurement of PKB
activity.22 The application of chemical
cytometry for the analysis of PKB activity from individual PDA tumor
cells should furnish a comprehensive assessment of PKB signaling heterogeneity
within a tumor biopsy.

Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors
have enabled novel insights
into human tumor cell biology as well as measurement of tumor-cell
response to pharmacologic therapies. PDX tumors are formed by subcutaneously
implanting a small fragment of primary tumor into an immunocompromised
mouse.23 PDX cells can then be passaged
over time to form a renewable tissue resource. PDX models recapitulate
the human tumor microenvironment and maintain both the gene-expression
and genomic profiles as well as the morphology of the original human
tumor.23−27 Detailed IHC and allelotype analysis of PDA-derived xenografts have
demonstrated that the degree of differentiation and nuclear polymorphisms
in the original tumor sample are maintained immediately after establishment
and following serial passage from one nude mouse to another.28 PDX models are one of the most promising models
to deliver personalized therapeutics for pancreatic cancer patients
by permitting initial drug prescreening within the murine host.25 Furthermore, PDX models provide an abundant
and renewable source of primary PDA cells which can be utilized to
identify the aberrant signaling pathways within single tumor cells.

In this work, capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence
detection (CE-LIF) has been employed to quantify PKB activity in single
cells from tissue-cultured models of PDA as well as from PDX tumors.
A PKB substrate was introduced into single cells, and the formation
of phosphorylated product was quantified at varying times and substrate
concentrations. For both model systems, the time-averaged rates of
peptide phosphorylation and proteolysis within the single cells were
measured at varying times and peptide concentrations. The impact of
the inhibitor wortmannin, an irreversible inhibitor of PI3-K, was
assessed on peptide phosphorylation and degradation to understand
drug effects on both metabolic processes. Comparisons between single
cells and among the primary PDX tumor cells and cultured cell lines
revealed important differences in the cell-to-cell variability within
cells from the same population as well as between cell types.

Experimental
Section
Materials, Peptide Synthesis, and Statistical Analysis
Detailed information on materials, synthesis of peptides, and the
statistical analyses utilized can be found in the Supporting Information.

Immortalized Cell Culture
PANC-1 (human pancreatic
carcinoma), CFPAC-1 (human metastatic ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma),
HPAF-II (human pancreatic adenocarcinoma), and WI-38 (human lung tissue)
cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.29−32 PANC-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin
(100 units mL–1), and streptomycin (100 μg
mL–1). CFPAC-1 cells were grown in IMDM supplemented
with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 units mL–1), and streptomycin
(100 μg mL–1). HPAF-II and WI-38 cells were
propagated in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 units
mL–1), and streptomycin (100 μg mL–1). All cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 37 °C
in 5% CO2 and passaged into fresh media every 2–3
days. Cells used for single-cell CE experiments were plated the day
before the experiments onto custom chambers, prepared by using poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS, Sylguard 184) to glue a silicon O-ring (McMaster-Carr) to a
#1 glass coverslip (Fisher). A dilute cell suspension was added to
500 μL of the appropriate media in the chamber, and chambers
were placed in the humidified incubator until use in the experiments.

Cell Preparation from Patient-Derived Xenografts
Pancreatic
tumor tissue from deidentified patients were engrafted subcutaneously
into the flanks of NSG/NOD (nonobese diabetic scid gamma/nonobese
diabetic) mice, expanded, and passed over time. All animal experiments
were carried out ethically under protocols approved by the University
of North Carolina Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.27,33 Harvested tumors were immersed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS;
137 mM NaCl, 27 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.75
mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) with penicillin (500 units
mL–1) and streptomycin (500 μg mL–1) and dissected into small fragments. Tumors were disaggregated by
incubating at 37 °C for 20–40 min in 40 mg mL–1 collagenase D and Dispase II. After incubation, the mixture was
centrifuged at 1500g for 2 min prior to suspension
in fresh media. The cell suspensions were immediately plated onto
cell chambers and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin
(100 units mL–1), and streptomycin (100 μg
mL–1) and maintained in a humidified atmosphere
at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The chambers used for single-cell
experiments were made of a thin film of polystyrene (146 ± 10
μm thick) prepared with 10% polystyrene in GBL and baked at
90 °C for 4 h and 120 °C for 20 h, as described previously.34 PDMS was used to glue a silicon O-ring (McMaster-Carr)
to the polystyrene thin film to create the chamber. Chambers were
oxygen-plasma treated for 5 min and used either uncoated or coated
with 0.1% gelatin. To enable surface attachment, cells were plated
in the chambers 36 h prior to use.

Western Blot
PANC-1,
CFPAC-1, and HPAF-II cell lysates
were prepared on ice with RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase
inhibitors. Cells treated with wortmannin were incubated in 1 μM
wortmanin for 10 min prior to lysis. Protein extracts were quantified
for total protein with a Bradford Assay. The lysates were separated
by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
prior to transfer to a PVDF membrane. Primary antibodies were antiphospho-PKB
(Ser473) rabbit antibody; anti-PKB rabbit antibody directed against
total PKB; and antivinculin mouse antibody directed against vinculin.
Secondary antibodies were antirabbit or antimouse IgG conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Samples were visualized using an electrochemiluniescent
substrate for HRP.

Single-Cell CE
Chambers with cells
were placed on the
microscope stage and perfused with extracellular buffer [ECB; 135
mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, and
10 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), pH 7.4, 37 °C] to remove
culture media. To calculate cell volume, PDX tumor cells were modeled
as spheres and tissue-cultured cells were modeled as rectangles with
a height of 3 μm. Cell volume ranged from 1 to 15 pL, with 62%
of the cells between 3 and 8 pL. Peptide VI-B was introduced into
single cells by microinjection using finely pulled glass capillaries
(FemtoJet Injectman NI 2, Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY) and an injection
pressure of 200 hPa for 0.5 s. A single cell was microinjected with
peptide VI-B and incubated in ECB (37 °C) flowing at 3 mL min–1.

Single-cell CE was performed using a custom-built
CE system mounted on a microscope stage coupled to laser-induced fluorescence
detection as described previously.35,36 A detailed
description of the custom-built system can be found in the Supporting Information. Fused silica capillaries
[30 μm inner diameter, 360 μm outer diameter (Polymicro
Technologies, Phoenix, AZ)] had a total length of 38 cm and an effective
length of 21.5 cm. The electrophoretic buffer was 300 mM borate, pH
7.5, and a field strength of 260 V was applied for separations. Electrophoresis
was initiated by application of a negative voltage to the outlet while
the inlet was held at ground. For single cells, the capillary was
positioned approximately 20 μm above the cell of interest prior
to cell lysis. A focused pulse (5 ns) from an Nd:YAG laser created
a cavitation bubble which mechanically lysed the cell. Simultaneously,
−3 kV was applied to the capillary inlet while the outlet was
held at ground so that the cell’s contents were electrokinetically
loaded into the capillary inlet. The capillary inlet was then transferred
to an electrophoretic buffer reservoir and electrophoresis initiated.

To treat cells with the inhibitor wortmannin, media was removed
from the cell chamber and replaced with 500 μL of 500 nM wortmannin
in the appropriate cell media. The cells were incubated for 10 min
in a 37 °C humidified incubator. Cells were then treated as described
above. To estimate the amount of peptide in each cell, a known concentration
of each peptide was hydrodynamically loaded into the capillary and
electrophoresed, and the area under the resulting peak was calculated.
Poiseuille’s equation was utilized to estimate the amount of
peptide loaded into the capillary.37 Initial
substrate concentration in each cell was determined by dividing the
calculated number of moles microinjected into each cell by the estimated
cell volume.

Antibody Staining
All PDX tumor
samples were stained
with antihuman EpCAM antibody conjugated to AlexaFluor647 prior to
single cell analysis. EpCAM-positive PANC-1 cells and EpCAM-negative
WI-38 cells were used as controls for antibody staining. Cells in
chambers were rinsed with ECB and incubated in a 1:40 solution of
anti-EpCAM in ECB for 15 min in a humidified 37 °C incubator.
Cells were rinsed with ECB prior to imaging (excitation = 620 ±
20 nm, emission = 690 ± 30 nm) using a CoolSnap HQ2 CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). Only cells staining positive
for EpCAM were microinjected with peptide and analyzed by CE.

Results
and Discussion
Characterization of Peptidase Activity in
Single Tissue-Cultured
Cells Derived from Pancreatic Adenocarcinomas
Three representative
pancreatic cancer cell lines were selected on the basis of their variability
in PKB activity. PANC-1 cells were derived from a 56-year old Caucasian
male with pancreatic cancer;31 CFPAC-1
cells were derived from the liver of a 26-year old Caucasian male
with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic cancer;30 and HPAF-II cells were obtained from a human pancreatic carcinoma
isolated from the ascitic fluid of a 44-year old Caucasian male with
primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma and metastases to the liver, diaphragm,
and lymph nodes.29 To assess the degradation
of peptide-based reporters in these tumor lines, a previously validated,
peptidase-resistant PKB substrate (peptide VI-B, 6FAM-GRP-MeArg-AFTF-MeAla-NH2)22 was microinjected into single cells. After a 5 min incubation, the
cell was lysed and the cellular contents separated by capillary electrophoresis.
Peaks were identified as intact peptide, phosphorylated peptide, and
fragment peptide based on comigration with standards. When peptide
VI-B was incubated in PANC-1 (n = 11), CFPAC-1 (n = 11), or HPAF-II (n = 10) cells for
5 min, four peaks were present on the electropherograms, corresponding
to intact peptide, phosphorylated peptide, and two fragment peptides
(Figures 1A and S1, Supporting
Information). The fragment peptides were identified as the
5- and 8-residue fragments of the parent peptide. The intact parent
peptide accounted for 23 ± 10%, 39 ± 13%, and 45 ±
2% of total peptide in PANC-1, CFPAC-1, and HPAF-II cells, respectively.
The abundances of the two fragment peptides were similar among the
three cell lines, with PANC-1, CFPAC-1, and HPAF-II cells possessing
12 ± 3%, 9 ± 5%, and 10 ± 2% of the 5-residue fragment
and 38 ± 10%, 36 ± 17%, and 41 ± 4% of the 8-residue
fragment, respectively, after 5 min. These values are similar to those
previously measured in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP (n = 19), where the intact peptide was found to comprise
15 ± 5% of all peptide present after 5 min and the 5- and 8-residue
fragments accounted for 13 ± 7% and 40 ± 13% of all peptide,
respectively.22

was used as a loading standard (D).

A time-averaged rate of degradation of intact VI-B in each
cell
line was calculated by assuming 100 pg of total protein in each cell.38 The time-averaged rate of degradation in PANC-1,
CFPAC-1, and HPAF-II cells was determined to have a median of 0.02
zmol pg–1 s–1 (Q1 and Q3 of 0.007 and 0.06
zmol pg–1 s–1); 0.06 zmol pg–1 s–1 (Q1 and Q3 of 0.03 and 0.09 zmol pg–1 s–1); and 0.1 zmol pg–1 s–1 (Q1 and Q3 of 0.04 and 0.5 zmol pg–1 s–1), respectively. The difference in amount of
peptide breakdown between cell lines was not statistically significant,
with p-values of 0.1710 (PANC-1 vs CFPAC-1), 0.5735
(PANC-1 vs HPAF-II), and 0.9008 (CFPAC-1 vs HPAF-II). In each cell
line, a plot of the time-averaged rate of degradation of intact VI-B
as a function of initial substrate concentration revealed a direct
linear correspondence between rate and substrate concentration (Figure
S2, Supporting Information). These time-averaged
rates of degradation did not statistically differ (p-values all greater than 0.07) from that previously reported for
the degradation of peptide VI-B in LNCaP lysates, with a median rate
of 0.02 zmol pg–1 s–1 (Q1 and Q3 of 0.007
zmol pg–1 s–1 and 0.05 zmol pg–1 s–1).22 The first-order relationship between degradation rate and substrate
concentration suggested that the capacity of the endogenous peptidases
was not saturated, even though substrate concentration in individual
cells varied over 3 orders of magnitude. Similar observations have
been previously reported.39−41 This capacity for peptide metabolism
may be the result of the need to rapidly recycle large quantities
of damaged proteins produced in these rapidly growing tumor cells.

Measurement of PKB Activation in Single Tissue-Cultured Cells
Derived from Pancreatic Adenocarcinomas
In addition to the
two fragment peaks observed in single cells, phosphorylation of peptide
VI-B was likewise seen in all three cell types. After peptide VI-B
was incubated in PANC-1 cells for 5 min (Figure 1C), the median amount of phosphorylation was 65% (Q1 = 48% and Q3 = 71%). Assuming
a total protein content of 100 pg per cell, the median time-averaged
rate of phosphorylation was 0.01 zmol pg–1 s–1 (Q1 and Q3 of 0.007 and 0.06 zmol pg–1 s–1).

When peptide VI-B was incubated for 5 min
in CFPAC-1 cells (Figure 1C), the median amount
of phosphorylation was 21% (Q1 = 15% and Q3 = 45%). The distribution of phosphorylated
product appeared to be bimodal, with a cluster of 6 cells showing
smaller amounts of phosphorylation (8–20%) and a cluster of
5 cells displaying larger amounts of phosphorylation (41–60%).
Statistical analysis of a much larger population of cells will be
required to evaluate whether or not the behavior of the CFPAC-1 cells
is truly bimodal. Percent phosphorylation as a function of initial
substrate concentration was plotted to determine if a bimodal variation
of the amount of peptide injected into the cells would explain the
varying distribution of phosphorylation. However, there appeared to
be no correlation between initial substrate concentration and percent
phosphorylation (data not shown). Assuming 100 pg of protein/cell,
the median time-averaged rate of phosphorylation in single CFPAC-1
cells was 0.01 zmol pg–1 s–1 (Q1 and Q3 of 0.009
and 0.03 zmol pg–1 s–1). The time-averaged
rates between the two groups of cells likewise differed, with a median
for the lower group of 0.01 zmol pg–1 s–1 (Q1 and Q3 of 0.008 and 0.08 zmol pg–1 s–1) and a median for the higher group of 0.04 (Q1 and Q3 of 0.01 and 0.06 zmol
pg–1 s–1). Work by Cantley and
others suggests that bimodal activation of the PKB signaling pathway
may occur in some cell types and confer resistance to chemotherapy.42−45

In HPAF-II cells, the median amount of phosphorylation of
VI-B
after a 5 min incubation was 4% (Q1 =
2% and Q3 = 7%; Figure 1C) and the median time-averaged rate of phosphorylation was
0.005 zmol pg–1 s–1 (Q1 and Q3 of 0.002 and 0.01
zmol pg–1 s–1). Single-cell analysis
of substrate phosphorylation in intact, single PANC-1, CFPAC-1, and
HPAF-II cells revealed a difference in the time-averaged rate of PKB
activity among the three lines, indicating high, moderate, and low
amounts of active PKB in the cells, respectively. A nonparametric
Kruskal–Wallis statistical analysis of variance of these three
populations demonstrated a statistically significant difference between
the three populations (p-value of 4.4 × 10–4). Previous work in the prostate cancer cell line
LNCaP revealed a median phosphorylation percentage of 31% (Q1 and Q3 of 12%
and 44%) and a median time-averaged phosphorylation rate of 0.01 zmol
pg–1 s–1 (Q1 and Q3 of 0.004 and 0.03 zmol
pg–1 s–1), similar to the median
of the CFPAC-1 cells.22

Inhibition
of PKB Activity in Tissue-Cultured Cells
Wortmannin is an
irreversible inhibitor of PI3-K at nanomolar levels,
blocking the phosphorylation of phoshatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate
(PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3).46 PIP3 recruits PKB
to the plasma membrane which leads to PKB phosphorylation and activation.
To determine whether phosphorylation of peptide VI-B was sensitive
to wortmannin, PANC-1 (n = 11), CFPAC-1 (n = 11), and HPAF-II (n = 10) cells were
incubated with 500 nM wortmannin prior to microinjection of peptide
VI-B into single cells and subsequent electrophoresis. In all three
cell lines, incubation with wortmannin eliminated the phosphorylation
of the peptide in single cells (Figure 1C).
In all cases, there was a statistical difference in the amount of
VI-B phosphorylated in treated and untreated cells (p-value <1 × 10–4 for all three cell types).
Inhibition of VI-B phosphorylation at these low wortmannin concentrations
suggests that the peptide was predominantly acting as a substrate
for PKB, as the wortmannin concentration used was an order of magnitude
less than that reported for efficient inhibition of MLCK, the next
kinase most susceptible to wortmannin.46 Degradation of peptide VI-B was observed in all wortmannin-treated
cells, and both the 8- and 5-residue fragments were observed in the
majority of the wortmannin-treated cells (Figures 1B and S2, Supporting Information). A plot of the time-averaged rate of degradation of parent peptide
VI-B as a function of initial substrate concentration (Figure S2, Supporting Information) revealed a linear correlation
with a positive slope. Furthermore, there was no statistical difference
between the time-averaged rate of peptide degradation in wortmannin-treated
and untreated cells (p-values of 0.7705, 0.8810,
and 0.9999 for PANC-1, CFPAC-1, and HPAF-II cells, respectively.)

Active PKB Determined by Western Blot Analysis in Cell Lysates
Derived from Pancreatic Adenocarcinomas
Western blot analysis
was performed to compare single cell results with the traditional
bulk lysate measurements of PKB activity for the three cell types
(Figure 1D). Total PKB was determined using
an anti-PKB antibody sensitive to endogenous levels of PKB1, PKB2,
and PKB3. Active PKB was determined using a monoclonal antibody against
the phosphorylated serine at position 473. The same trend was observed
as was seen in single cells, with PANC-1 cells showing the highest
amount of phosphorylated PKB, CFPAC-1 cells a moderate amount, and
HPAF-II cells the smallest amount. Although the averaged data from
the single cell measurements matches that of the Western blots, single
cell analysis revealed the cell-to-cell heterogeneity not available
via the more traditional Western blot.

Wortmannin also decreased
the amount of phosphorylated Ser473 in the cell lysates, as determined
by Western blot (Figure 1D). The amount of
pSer473 decreased in all three cell lines when wortmannin was present,
though the total amount of PKB remained the same in treated and untreated
samples.

Phosphorylation of Peptide VI-B over Time
To determine
the effect of incubation time on peptide phosphorylation, peptide
VI-B was microinjected into single tissue-cultured cells and incubated
for 1, 3, 5, 10, or 30 min (Figure S3A–C, Supporting Information). In all cases, at least 10 cells were
analyzed for each time point. For all three cell types, only a single
HPAF-II cell showed phosphorylated product after a 1 min incubation.
After a 3 min incubation, the CFPAC-1 cells displayed the highest
percentage of phosphorylated product when compared to PANC-1 and HPAF-II
cells. PANC-1 had the highest median amount of phosphorylation after
a 5 min incubation, as described in the section Measurement of PKB Activation in Single Tissue-Cultured Cells Derived
from Pancreatic Adenocarcinomas. This result held true at the
10 and 30 min time points as well. Table S1 (Supporting Information) summarizes the median data with the
first and third quartiles for all 3 cells types at all incubation
times. There is heterogeneity in the amount of phosphorylated product
at nearly all time points sampled in all three cell types, although
the median amount of phosphorylated product peaked at 5 min and decreased
over time in the PANC-1 and CFPAC-1 cells and appeared to level off
after 5 min in the HPAF-II cells.

The time-averaged rate of
phosphorylation as a function of the initial substrate concentration
for each cell type was plotted in order to identify whether the initial
amount of substrate peptide loaded into each cell influenced the time-averaged
phosphorylation rate (Figure S3D–F, Supporting
Information). In all cell types at all 5 time points, a linear
correlation was observed, showing that as the initial substrate concentration
increased so did the time-averaged rate. This correlation was independent
of incubation time, as the same trend was observed for all time points
in all three cell types.

Measurement of PKB Activation in Single Cells
Derived from PDX
Tumors
PDX tumor cells were readily distinguished from nontumor
cells by the presence of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM,
also known as CD326) upon immunohistochemical staining (Figure 2C,F). In these experiments, PANC-1 cells (EpCAM+) and WI-38 fibroblast cells (EpCAM–) served
as positive and negative staining controls, respectively, for these
experiments (Figure 2A,B,D,E). PKB activation
was measured in single tumor cells by staining the PDX tumor sample
with anti-EpCAM antibody and then microinjecting peptide VI-B into
the EpCAM+ cells. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for
5 or 10 min and their contents separated by electrophoresis. Up to
3 peaks were observed in each single-cell electropherogram: the intact
parent peptide; phosphorylated substrate; and the 8-residue fragment
peptide (Figure 3). When incubated for 5 min,
phosphorylation of peptide VI-B ranged from 0% to 72% of the undegraded
peptide (n = 11). After a 10 min incubation, phosphorylation
increased to 0–89% of total intact peptide (n = 11). The range of peptide phosphorylation, or PKB activation,
in the PDX tumor cells was substantially broader than that for the
cultured cell lines suggesting that the signaling pathways in PDX
tumors were more heterogeneous than cultured cell lines. These results
are consistent with the tumor heterogeneity observed during single-cell
sequencing,18 demonstrating the value of
single-cell characterization in understanding tumor cell biology.

in a single PDX tumor cell for 10 min without treatment with wortmannin
(C). The solid arrow indicates intact parent peptide, and the asterisk
indicates phosphorylated peptide. Peak 1 corresponds to the 8-residue
fragment peptide. (D) Percent of phosphorylated substrate in single,

Inhibition of PKB Activity in Single Cells
Derived from PDX
Tumors
Cells were pretreated with wortmannin (500 nM), stained
with EpCAM, and then microinjected with peptide VI-B. After a 5 min
incubation, 5 of 6 cells displayed two peaks on the electropherograms,
which corresponded to intact parent peptide and the 8-residue fragment
(Figure 3B,D). Phosphorylated peptide (1% of
total intact peptide) was present in only a single cell. These data
suggest that PKB was primarily responsible for phosphorylation of
the substrate. When the mean phosphorylation observed in wortmannin-treated
cells was compared to that seen in untreated cells at both the 5 and
10 min time points, a statistical difference in phosphorylation was
observed (p-values of 0.0015 and 1 × 10–4, respectively).

Degradation of Peptide
VI-B in Single Cells Derived from PDX
Tumors
In addition to the intact parent peptide and its phosphorylated
counterpart, the 8-residue fragment peptide was also detected in the
PDX tumor cells (Figures 3 and 4). However, it was present in much lower amounts than in the
tissue-cultured lines previously tested, with a median of 11% of all
peptide present (Q1 and Q3 of 7% and 12%). When compared against the standard tissue-cultured
cells, this value was found to be significantly lower than in any
of the three cell types analyzed (p-value of <10–4 in all three cases.) The 5-residue fragment was not
observed in any of the PDX tumor cells examined (n = 28), though it was prevalent in tissue-cultured cells. Figure 4A details the degradation pattern between tissue-cultured
and PDX tumor cells.

tumor cells.
(A) Cleavage locations identified for each cell type tested. The prostate
cancer line LNCaP* data is from Proctor et al.22 The slope is defined as the change in the average degradation
rate with respect to the initial substrate concentration. R2 is the correlation coefficient for the fit
of the straight line. (B) Degradation rate of peptide VI-B incubated
in single pancreatic cancer tissue-cultured cells (open circles) or
PDX tumor cells (closed squares) as a function of initial substrate
concentration. The dashed line is the linear fit (R2 = 0.3) of the tissue-cultured data, and the solid line
is the linear fit (R2 = 0.1) of the PDX
tumor cell data.

For the PDX tumor cells,
the average rate of peptide degradation
depended on the initial substrate concentration (Figure 4B). When fit to a line, the slope was 0.26 zmol μM–1 s–1, an order of magnitude less
than that seen for the tissue-cultured cells in this work and in prior
work using other tissue-cultured cells,22 suggesting that the peptidases responsible for degradation of peptide
VI-B are substantially less active in the PDX tumor cells compared
to that in tissue-cultured cells. Analysis of covariance of the two
regression lines generated an F-statistical value
of 7.598 (yielding a p-value <10–4) indicating that there was a statistical difference in the two regression
lines.

Conclusions
A PKB substrate peptide
was utilized as a dual reporter to simultaneously
measure peptidase and kinase activity in single, intact pancreatic
cancer cells. The reporter was degraded into two fragment peptides
(a 5-mer and an 8-mer) in all three tissue-cultured cell types analyzed,
similar to that observed in previous studies using prostate cancer
cells.22 Reporter degradation in single
PDX tumor cells differed from that of the tissue-cultured cells in
both the location of cleavage and the time-averaged rate of degradation.
Although two cleavage sites were identified in tissue-cultured cells,
only one (the 8-mer) was observed in the PDX tumor cells. A search
of the peptidase database MEROPS47 reveals
that, of the common cytosolic peptidases, dipeptidyl peptidase II
preferentially cleaves after an alanine residue, which would yield
the 5-mer observed in these studies. Thus, it is possible that the
tissue-cultured cells overexpress this particular cytosolic peptidase
compared to the primary cells. This may be an adaptation of the tissue-cultured
cell-lines to prolonged culture in an in vitro setting.
In addition, the time-averaged rate of degradation in PDX tumor cells
was an order of magnitude less than that seen in tissue-cultured cells,
demonstrating that peptidases are less active or more tightly controlled
in the PDX cells than the tissue-cultured lines which is likely a
second adaptation to prolonged in vitro culture.

PKB activity was also assessed in single cells by comparing the
amount of phosphorylated product to the amount of substrate loaded
into each cell. High PKB activity in pancreatic cancer tumors is associated
with resistance to apoptosis, higher rates of metastasis and mutations,
and increased proliferation and uninhibited growth.48 The PANC-1 tissue-cultured cells displayed the highest
median amount of PKB activity of the three cell lines examined, implying
that they are more adapted for survival in stressful environments
and are likely to show increased rates of proliferation and resistance
to stress compared to other cell types. Although a much larger population
of CFPAC-1 cells would need to be analyzed to identify whether or
not the PKB signaling is truly bimodal, our results suggest this might
be a possibility. If high and low states of PKB activity do exist
within this population, it would provide these cells with a means
to survive chemotherapeutic insults, with the population shifting
to one extreme or the other in response to drug treatment.

The
PKB activity measured in the PDX cells varied more than that
seen in the tissue-cultured cells, with many cells showing no PKB
activity and others demonstrating very high levels of substrate phosphorylation.
This suggests that the individual cells in the animal might be adapted
to the different environmental conditions within the tumor whereas
the tissue-cultured cells are expected to experience significantly
less environmental variability. For example, a low pH and anoxic tumor
region might require greater PKB activity to survive the resulting
stresses compared to a well-vascularized, lower-stress region of a
tumor. The tumor heterogeneity would ensure tumor survival under the
varying conditions found in vivo.

As this technology
matures to become higher throughput, single-cell
CE may be of value in monitoring PKB activity levels in single cells
from patients diagnosed with PDA. Previous studies have shown that
inhibition of the PI3-K/PKB pathway sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells
to chemotherapy.48,49 Thus, a better understanding
of whether the PI3-K/PKB pathway is active in a patient’s tumor
as well as knowledge of the diversity in single-cell signaling would
be a valuable guide to tailoring chemotherapeutics. Single-cell CE
can be used to determine the effectiveness PI3-K/PKB pathway inhibition
within a cell population and whether a subset of cells has become
resistant to PI3-K/PKB pathway-targeted therapeutics. Tracking the
evolution of PI3-K/PKB pathway signaling in a tumor in response to
therapy may enable more tailored therapeutic strategies than currently
available.
