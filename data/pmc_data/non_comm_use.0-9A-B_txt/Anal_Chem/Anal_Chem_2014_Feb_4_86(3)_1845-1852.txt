Although commonly known as a highly
toxic chemical, cyanide is
also an essential reagent for many industrial processes in areas such
as mining, electroplating, and synthetic fiber production. The “heavy”
use of cyanide in these industries, along with its necessary transportation,
increases the possibility of human exposure. Because the onset of
cyanide toxicity is fast, a rapid, sensitive, and accurate method
for the diagnosis of cyanide exposure is necessary. Therefore, a field
sensor for the diagnosis of cyanide exposure was developed based on
the reaction of naphthalene dialdehyde, taurine, and cyanide, yielding
a fluorescent β-isoindole. An integrated cyanide capture “apparatus”,
consisting of sample and cyanide capture chambers, allowed rapid separation
of cyanide from blood samples. Rabbit whole blood was added to the
sample chamber, acidified, and the HCN gas evolved was actively transferred
through a stainless steel channel to the capture chamber containing
a basic solution of naphthalene dialdehyde (NDA) and taurine. The
overall analysis time (including the addition of the sample) was <3
min, the linear range was 3.13–200 μM, and the limit
of detection was 0.78 μM. None of the potential interferents
investigated (NaHS, NH4OH, NaSCN, and human serum albumin)
produced a signal that could be interpreted as a false positive or
a false negative for cyanide exposure. Most importantly, the sensor
was 100% accurate in diagnosing cyanide poisoning for acutely exposed
rabbits.

==== Body
Cyanide (HCN
or CN–, inclusively represented as CN) is commonly
known as a poison and
a chemical warfare agent (CWA). However, the industrial need for CN
in many chemical processes, such as mineral extraction, electroplating,
and the fabrication of synthetic fibers,1 drives cyanide production for industrial use to over 1.1 million
tons per year.2 Therefore, industrial use
of mass quantities of cyanide, with its associated transportation
through highly populated areas, drastically increases the risk of
exposure. Cyanide exposure may also occur through diet, smoke inhalation
(fire or cigarette smoke), or exposure from illicit use.3,4 Illicit use can be targeted at a single individual (i.e., poisoning),
a small group of targeted individuals (e.g., mass suicides), or a
large group of people (e.g., terrorist attacks). Some of the more
recent incidents of illicit cyanide use are the Tylenol Poisonings
in 1982,5 the use of cyanide-gas-producing
devices in Tokyo subway and railway station restrooms in 1995,6 ingestion of cyanide tablets by Michael Marin
upon receipt of a guilty verdict for arson in June 2012,7 and the death of Urooj Khan, a lottery winner,
in Chicago in July 2012.8 Another illicit,
relatively little-known, use of cyanide is to stun exotic fish for
easy capture, with an estimated 90% of the exotic fish originating
from the Philippines captured in this manner.9

Whether the route of cyanide exposure is accidental or deliberate,
the mechanism of cyanide toxicity is similar. Cyanide causes cellular
death by blocking adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production through
the binding of cytochrome c oxidase.10 The
onset of cyanide toxicity is rapid, and toxic levels in blood can
be observed at concentrations of approximately 19 μM11,12 while death can be observed at concentrations as low as 115 μM.12,13 Although CN is highly toxic, it is endogenously present in animals
due to normal amino acid metabolism, dietary intake, and tobacco consumption.3,14 Because CN and its major metabolites, thiocyanate (SCN–) and 2-aminothiazoline-4-carboxylic acid (ATCA), have each been
used as markers for cyanide exposure in biofluids,14−16 endogenous
concentrations may complicate the diagnosis of cyanide exposure if
not fully understood. Table 1 lists the ranges
of endogenous concentrations of CN and its major metabolites, each
of which are highly variable.

b Logue
et al.1 compiled endogenous concentrations
of cyanide, thiocyanate, and
ATCA for smokers and nonsmokers from studies prior to 2010.

Thiocyanate is the most common indirect
marker of cyanide exposure
because it is the major metabolite of cyanide, accounting for 80%
of cyanide metabolism.18 ATCA has only
recently been suggested for use as a biomarker, but it accounts for
up to 20% of cyanide metabolism, with an increase in ATCA production
as cyanide dose increases.3,19 Although SCN– is a valuable marker of cyanide exposure, metabolism of cyanide
to thiocyanate is enzymatically rate limited20 and maximum thiocyanate concentrations can lag maximum cyanide concentrations
by approximately 20 min to 6 h.21 Although
ATCA mirrors the behavior of cyanide,19 its concentration in plasma has been found to be relatively low,
necessitating an extremely sensitive diagnostic analysis.

Because
of the rapid onset of toxic effects from cyanide poisoning
and the difficulty in developing a rapid and sensitive analysis for
ATCA, the most appropriate target for diagnosis of acute cyanide exposure
is the direct analysis of cyanide as soon after exposure as possible.
Although the detection of cyanide may be accomplished by several methods,
including chromatography, mass spectrometry, fluorescence, and chemiluminescence,22 five recent methods for cyanide analysis from
biological matrices have been proposed (Table 2) that focus on rapid analysis and/or portable technology. Three
of these methods are based on a change in the absorbance of cobinamide
(hydroxoaquocobinamide23,24 or hydroxocyanocobinamide25) in the presence of cyanide. The remaining two
are based on fluorescence detection of cyanide upon its interaction
with copper(II) cubic mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (Cu2+-c-mpg-C3N4)26 or 1-(4′-nitrophenyl) benzimidazolium.27 Additionally, there have been a number of fluorometric
and colorimetric probes developed in recent years for cyanide analysis,28 but these probes have yet to be integrated into
sensor technology. Table 2 lists the analysis
time and limits of detection (LODs) for the proposed sensors, along
with potential issues associated with each technology. Although some
of the listed CN detection techniques have LODs reaching concentrations
into the nanomolar range, endogenous levels of CN in humans range
from 0.02 to 10 μM (see Table 1). Furthermore,
the toxic effects of CN appear at blood concentrations around 19 μM.12 Therefore, an LOD of 3 μM or less, as
achieved by each technology listed in Table 2, is likely sufficient for diagnosis of CN exposure (i.e., an LOD
of 3 μM is typically associated with a lower limit of quantification
of around 10 μM). Considering this, the other characteristics
listed in Table 2 are likely more important
in comparing these diagnostic technologies. For the techniques proposed,
large sample volumes (1 mL),23 interference
from hydrogen sulfide,23,24 long analysis times,26,27 and unconfirmed ability to diagnose CN exposure,26,27 limit their application for diagnosis.

Considering limitations
of the currently proposed rapid/portable
CN detection techniques, there is a critical need for a rapid point-of-care
diagnostic to confirm cyanide exposure and inform the administration
of antidotes. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid and
sensitive sensor for the accurate diagnosis of acute, toxic cyanide
exposure.

Experimental Section
Materials
All materials used were
HPLC grade unless
otherwise indicated. Sodium hydroxide, sulfuric acid, sodium cyanide,
KH2PO4, K2HPO4, and NH4OH were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Hanover Park, IL).
2,3-Naphthalene dialdehyde (NDA) was obtained from TCI America (Portland,
OR). Taurine (2-aminoethane sulfonic acid) and NaBO2·4H2O were purchased from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA). NaSCN was
purchased from Acros Organics (Morris Plains, NJ). Human serum albumin
(HSA) and NaHS were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

Phosphate (0.1 M)/borate (0.05 M) buffer and stock solutions of sodium
hydroxide (1 M), sulfuric acid (1 M), and NaSCN (1 mM) were prepared
in deionized water. Sodium cyanide standards and NaHS were obtained
by dilution from 1.8 mM and 1 M stock solutions, respectively, with
10 mM NaOH. NH4OH was prepared by diluting the original
aqueous solution (29% by weight or 14.5 M) to 30 μM in deionized
water. The NDA (2 mM) stock solution was prepared in phosphate/borate
buffer and 40% methanol. A taurine (50 mM) solution was prepared in
phosphate/borate buffer. A standard HSA solution was obtained by dissolving
3.3 mg of HSA per mL of deionized water.

Biological Samples
Rabbit whole blood samples were
obtained from two sources: (1) nonsterile whole blood with 2.5% EDTA
from young rabbits was purchased from Pel-Freeze Biologicals (Rogers,
AR) and (2) whole blood from cyanide exposed, New Zealand White rabbits
(Oryctologus cuniculus, male, 3.5–4.5
kg) was obtained from the University of California, Irvine. Rabbits
(n = 6) were administered lethal doses of 6.8 mM
NaCN in 0.9% NaCl (1 mL/min continuous intravenous infusion) and blood
was drawn prior to and 15, 25, and 35 min following the initiation
of cyanide infusion. The blood samples were placed in EDTA tubes to
prevent coagulation, frozen, and shipped on ice (overnight) to South
Dakota State University for analysis of cyanide. Upon receipt, the
blood was stored at −80 °C until cyanide analysis was
performed.

All rabbits were cared for in compliance with the
“Principles of Laboratory Animal Care” formulated by
the National Society for Medical Research and the “Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” prepared by the National
Academy of Sciences and published by the National Institutes of Health.29 All studies involving rabbits were reviewed
and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

Fluorometric Analysis of Cyanide
Microdiffusion was
used to prepare cyanide for analysis. The microdiffusion of CN was
accomplished via a stacked cyanide capture apparatus. A schematic
of the stacked cyanide capture apparatus can be seen in Figure 1 with a lower chamber, called the sample chamber,
used to contain cyanide standards, swabs, whole blood samples, or
other sample matrices, and an upper chamber called the capture chamber,
containing a capture solution of 0.5 mM NDA:12.5 mM taurine:0.1 M
NaOH (1:1:1 by volume). These two chambers [8 (i.d.) × 50 mm
long] were separated by a hydrophobic 10 micron porous polyethylene
(PE) frit or a 1.5 mm thick silicone septum pierced with a 2 mm long,
28 gauge forward flow tube. The frit/septum was sandwiched between
the sample and capture chamber
using a 1.8 cm long piece of threaded (13 × 425) PVC tubing with
a 1.6 cm external diameter as a coupler. A needle at the top of the
capture chamber served as an outlet for the carrier gas. The sample
chamber septum was pierced with two inlet needles (at the bottom of
Figure 1), one for the injection of acid and
one for introduction of air. Attempts to combine the acid and air
introduction failed due to large viscosity fluctuation between the
solution and the air, resulting in difficulty in controlling the rate
of air flow through the chamber.

For the separation of CN from
the biological matrix, the sample was placed in the sample chamber
and acidified with sulfuric acid (300 μL of 1 M) and air (20
mL for the PE frit, 20 and 50 mL for the silicone septum were evaluated)
was forced over the sample headspace to a capture solution where HCN
gas was trapped in the capture chamber using strong base to convert
HCN to nonvolatile CN–. The captured CN– was then reacted with NDA and taurine in the capture solution, resulting
in a fluorescent β-isoindole product (Figure 2, Scheme A → B).30 The cyanide
capture apparatus fit within the detector chamber so that the portion
of the capture chamber containing the capture solution was in alignment
with the LED and a photodiode or optic fiber connected to a spectrophotometric
detector. Sample analysis time, beginning at sample introduction through
fluorescence detection, was less than 3 min. During this study, the
cyanide capture apparatus was cleaned with deionized water between
analyses, but washing the air and acid inlets and the air outlet (Figure 1) was unnecessary [i.e., no carryover was observed
except when using the PE frit and high concentrations of cyanide (>500
μM), likely due to HCN partitioning into the PE material; note
that the PE material was not used for the majority of the study].
Although the cyanide capture apparatus was reused in this study, it
could easily be designed to be disposable, eliminating the need for
washing and the potential for carryover.

Fluorometric analysis
was performed using one of two configurations.
Fluorometric Configuration 1 (FC1) utilized a 420 nm light emitting
diode (LED, TT Electronics, Weybridge, Surrey, KT13 9XB, England)
positioned at a 90° angle from a 400–650 nm light sensitive
photodiode (Avago Technologies, Ft. Collins, CO) and produced digital
signals ranging from 0 to 218. Fluorometric Configuration 2 (FC2)
consisted of a 410 nm high-powered LED (LED Engin, Inc., San Jose,
CA) irradiated through a focusing lens and directed toward the sample.
A second focusing lens positioned 90° from the irradiation path
was used to direct the fluorescent light to a 600 μm optical
fiber connected to a USB2000+ spectrophotometric detector. The signal
at 500 nm was used to quantify the amount of cyanide in the sample.
The focusing lenses, the optical fiber, and the spectrophotometric
detector were purchased from Ocean Optics (Dunedin, FL). Since the
detection limit for FC1 was not within the biologically relevant range
desired, fluorometric analysis was performed using FC2, unless otherwise
noted.

The field sensor dimensions were 15 × 20 ×
30 cm (l ×
w × h). Housed within the sensor was an acid reservoir, cyanide
capture apparatus chamber, a USB2000+ spectrophotometer (connected
to a laptop computer), a valve switching mechanism, a 1 mL syringe
with a 30 mm stroke linear actuator, and a 50 mL syringe with a 100
mm stroke linear actuator (each linear actuator served as a syringe
pump). NDA and taurine were stored separately and added to the capture
chamber prior to analysis.

reactions of NDA,
taurine, and cyanide. Pathways A → B and A → C both
yield H2O as a byproduct.

Reagent Stability
The stability of capture solution
reagents was an important factor pertaining to the field portability
of the sensor. Three different capture solution storage scenarios
were investigated. In scenario 1, all the capture solution reagents
(NDA, taurine, and NaOH) were mixed together and stored as one solution.
In scenario 2, NDA and taurine were mixed and stored as one solution,
while the NaOH solution was added at the time of analysis. In scenario
3, all the capture solution reagents were stored individually and
mixed at the time of analysis. All solutions were stored in amber
vials at room temperature for the duration of the stability study
and cyanide analysis was accomplished using FC1. A cyanide stock solution
(200 μM) was analyzed for all scenarios. The stock solutions
for scenarios 1 and 2 were analyzed from 0 to 60 min, with samples
for scenario 3 analyzed up to 70 days.

Analysis of Possible Interferents
Potentially interfering
compounds, NH4OH (30 μM), NaSCN (0.5 mM), HSA (3.3
mg/mL), and NaHS (110 μM), were evaluated alone (for false positive
evaluation) and spiked with 20 μM NaCN (for false negative evaluation).
The compounds of interest were evaluated at concentrations likely
found in biological matrices during cyanide poisoning (i.e., the naturally
occurring concentration of NH4OH as ammonia gas,31 thiocyanate in excess of the highest levels
seen in smokers,16,32 the amount of HSA present in
blood,31 and the highest concentration
of H2S found in the blood of sulfide poisoning fatalities33). Multiple mixtures of the interferent solutions
were used to evaluate additive effects to include (1) equal parts
NaHS and NH4OH solutions, (2) equal parts NaSCN and NH4OH solutions, (3) equal parts NaSCN, NaHS, NH4OH,
and HSA solutions, (4) equal parts NaSCN and HSA solutions, and (5)
equal parts of NaHS, NH4OH, and HSA solutions.

Analysis of
Cyanide from Rabbit Whole Blood
The analysis
of cyanide from rabbit whole blood was optimized to include sample
volume (50 and 100 μL), acid injection volume (200–500
μL), and acid concentration (0.25 to 2 M). Once the optimum
conditions were determined, a calibration curve was created with 0.25
to 200 μM cyanide spiked rabbit blood calibrators analyzed in
triplicate. Prior to each analysis, a 10 μM quality control
(QC) standard (cyanide spiked rabbit whole blood) was analyzed to
represent the concentration threshold, above which, a subject was
said to be “exposed”. This concentration was chosen
because it is the highest cyanide concentration that has been previously
observed in the blood of human smokers.1 Cyanide exposed rabbit blood samples (from U. C., Irvine) were analyzed
in triplicate for time points 0 (baseline), 15, 25, and 35 min. As
a measure to verify the performance of the sensor, the rabbit blood
samples were also analyzed using the LC–MS/MS analysis method
for cyanide described by Bhandari et al. 2013.34

Data Analysis
The limit of detection
(LOD) was determined
as the analyte concentration that produced a signal-to-noise ratio
(S/N) of 3, with the noise measured as the standard deviation of the
blank. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was defined as the
analyte concentration that produced a S/N of at least 10, a measured
concentration, calculated from the calibration curve, that was within
20% of the nominal concentration as a measure of accuracy, and a percent
relative standard deviation (%RSD) of ≤20% as a measure of
precision. For inclusion of calibrators in the linear range of the
sensor, replicate calibration standards were required to produce a
precision of ≤20% RSD and accuracy of 100 ± 20%. The upper
limit of quantification (ULOQ) was defined as the highest analyte
concentration that produced a measured concentration, that was within
20% of the nominal concentration as a measure of accuracy with a precision
of ≤20% RSD. It should be noted that the spectrophotometer
limited the maximum signal to ∼63,000 cps, which limited the
ULOQ for both aqueous and blood samples. All quantitative analytical
values (i.e., concentration, mean, standard deviation, etc.) were
calculated using Microsoft Office Excel 2010 (Redmond, WA).

Caution
Cyanide is toxic and hazardous to humans at
blood concentrations of ∼20 μM.12 HCN is produced from aqueous cyanide containing solutions near or
below a pH of 9.2. Therefore, all aqueous cyanide standards were prepared
in 10 mM NaOH and handled in a well-ventilated hood. HCN gas was produced
during the acidification process in the sample chamber and then captured
and derivatized in a basic solution containing NDA and taurine in
the capture chamber. The fluorescent β-isoindole product was
disposed of with organic waste. The proper use of personal protective
equipment (i.e., gloves, lab coat, etc.), laboratory equipment (i.e.,
ventilation hood), and proper waste disposal must be followed to prevent
the possibility of exposure.

Results and Discussion
Development
of a Cyanide Sample Preparation Apparatus
Two barrier materials
were evaluated to separate the sample and capture
chambers of the cyanide microdiffusion apparatus (Figure 1): (1) a silicone septa with stainless steel tubing
and (2) a 10 micron porous PE frit. Figure 3 shows the calibration curves achieved
with each barrier material. When the PE frit was used as the barrier,
the signals observed for the lowest and highest concentrations tested
were nonlinearly related to the cyanide concentration, and attempts
to describe the calibration data with a linear fit produced nonzero
intercepts. The PE frit produced an LOD of 3.13 μM and a linear
range of 25–100 μM. When using the silicone septa, linear
behavior was produced throughout the calibration range. When a low
volume of air (20 mL) was used to carry HCN from the sample to the
capture chamber, the linear range was 1.5–200 μM with
a detection limit of 0.5 μM (data not shown). When using 50
mL of air, the LOD decreased to 0.25 μM, the sensitivity increased
2.4× (from 263 to 626 μM–1), and the
linear range changed to 1.5–100 μM. (Note: with this
larger air volume, the 200 μM cyanide standard produced a signal
that saturated the detector, resulting in the reduced upper limit
of quantification.) Linear least-squares treatment of the calibration
data for both air volumes resulted in correlation coefficients of
0.999. The linear behavior of the silicon septa compared to the nonlinear
behavior of the PE frit was likely due to nonequilibrium partitioning
of HCN into the PE.

Aside from the analytical performance of
the two barrier materials, foaming of the sample was a major practical
issue. If heavy foaming occurred, it forced the capture solution out
of the air outlet (Figure 1) and required lower
flow rates and longer analysis times to ensure conservation of the
capture solution. Separation of the sample and capture chamber with
a polyethylene frit produced very small bubbles, resulting in heavy
sample foaming due to minimal surface tension stress lengthening the
time needed for the bubbles to burst. To avoid the loss of capture
solution, the time necessary to deliver the air through the sample
and capture chamber significantly increased. Conversely, when air
was forced through the silicone septa, relatively large bubbles with
uniform size and shape were produced, which significantly limited
foaming and allowed a faster flow of air from the sample to the capture
chamber. Moreover, the larger bubbles did not appear to hinder the
transfer of HCN to the capture solution. Therefore, the silicone septum
was preferred both practically and analytically.

Figure 3 Calibration curves obtained
for the PE frit (20 mL of air), the
silicone septa with forward flow tubing (50 mL of air shown), and
rabbit whole blood (50 mL of air). Aqueous standards were used for
the PE frit (○) and the silicone septa (□). A silicone
septa, with forward flow tubing as the chamber separation material,
was used for analysis of rabbit whole blood (△). Error bars
represent standard deviation.

Reagent Stability
Reagent stability is crucial when
developing a portable sensor, especially in locations where there
is a lack of refrigeration and/or climate control. Figure 4 shows that under the storage conditions where the
NDA and taurine were stored together (scenarios 1 and 2), extremely
unstable mixtures resulted. Conversly, NDA and taurine stored separately
(scenario 3) resulted in stable reagents for all time periods tested.
The behavior of scenarios 1 and 2 was similar, where the initial fluorescent
signal rapidly decreased until the fluorescence was essentially eliminated
by 40 min. Visually, the solutions for scenarios 1 and 2 were initially
clear but quickly became faintly yellow and orange, respectively,
each also containing a small amount of black precipitate. Over time,
these solutions became darker until the black precipitate pervaded.
This color change was a visual indication that NDA and taurine were
likely reacting together, potentially yielding an NDA–ditaurine
complex (see Figure 2, pathway A → C
→ D). Since taurine was in excess, it is likely that by 40
min, the main component of the solutions was an NDA–ditaurine
complex, which was incapable of producing the fluorescent β-isoindole
product.

Although more stringent storage conditions should be
tested (e.g., larger variations in temperature to account for extremes
the sensor may encounter), the stability of the capture solution reagents,
when stored separately, is encouraging for use in a cyanide field
sensor. In accordance with Figure 4, the reagents
would not need special storage conditions when stored separately (i.e.,
the only special storage condition was the use of amber bottles).
It should be noted that the day-to-day variations observed from storage
scenario 3 were likely due to fluctuations in the temperature of the
room and the electrical current produced from the sensor’s
power source (i.e., dual 9 V batteries) and were not reflective of
variability in the chemical or sample preparation strategies associated
with the analysis.

capture
solution reagents. The long-term stability of the reagents (up to
70 days) is presented in the inset. Error bars represent standard
deviation.

Analysis of Possible Interferents
The evaluation of
potential interferents was undertaken to assess the possibility of
false positive or negative diagnosis of cyanide poisoning from common
components of blood. Figure 5 shows that none
of the compounds investigated produced false positive signals (i.e.,
above the 5 μM cyanide standard) and that all individually tested
samples containing 20 μM NaCN produced signals within ±10%
of the standard (i.e., no false negatives were observed). Similarly,
none of the mixtures tested produced signals that could be interpreted
as false positives or negatives (data not shown). The specificity
of the current sensor is encouraging, considering H2S has
been noted as a potential interferent for other methods of cyanide
analysis. For example, the EPA ion chromatography method notes H2S (evolved when NaHS is acidified) as an interferent, masking
the presence of cyanide35 and the cobinamide-based
cyanide detection methods by Ma and Dasgupta also note H2S as a potential interferent.23,24

Samples containing
thiocyanate and HSA did produce a slightly elevated signal compared
to the aqueous blank, but below the 5 μM NaCN aqueous standard.
In 1971, Chung and Wood36 showed that thiocyanate
produced cyanide under acidic conditions in the presence of hydrogen
peroxide as an oxidizing agent. Since the sample chamber was under
acidic conditions, oxygen bubbled through the sample chamber likely
acted as an oxidizing agent, causing a small amount of cyanide to
form. For HSA, the elevated fluorescence may have been due to the
release of cyanide from cyanide–HSA adducts under acidic conditions.37

in cyanide spiked blood. Error bars represent standard deviation.

Analysis of Cyanide from
Rabbit Whole Blood
The analysis
of cyanide from whole blood required modification of the method used
for aqueous solutions, with 100 μL of sample and 300 μL
of 1.5 M H2SO4 found to be optimum conditions
for the microdiffusion of cyanide. Because the surface-area-to-volume
ratio of the sample chamber limited the amount of HCN gas evolved,
lower volumes of acid were used and the concentration of acid became
very important, with higher concentrations increasing the amount of
HCN evolved. The linear range for cyanide quantification in whole
blood was found to be 3.13–200 μM with a detection limit
of 0.78 μM, a slope of 310 μM–1, and
a correlation coefficient of 0.999 (Figure 3). Even with optimization, the recovery of cyanide was low (39% and
34% for 5 and 75 μM QC standards, respectively). The inefficient
recovery of cyanide was likely caused upon addition to whole blood
by its rapid transformation to volatile HCN gas at pH values below
its pKa of 9.2,14 enzyme-catalyzed conversion to SCN– in the presence
of a sulfur donor,3 and binding to blood
components, including hemoglobin (Hb), methemoglobin (metHb), and
albumin.3

Diagnosis of Cyanide Exposure
in Rabbits
The described
sensor was used to verify cyanide exposure in rabbits (Figure 6). Rabbit blood drawn prior to exposure produced
a small amount of fluorescence due to endogenous cyanide concentrations,19,38 but it was below the LOD. Rabbit blood drawn at 15, 25, and 35 min
into the infusion period produced cyanide concentrations of 35.6 ±
4.8, 49.7 ± 8.2, and 74.6 ± 15.6 μM, respectively,
as measured by the sensor. These concentrations deviated by less than
3.5% of the concentrations found by LC–MS/MS (Figure 6A). Similar to observations of Bhandari et al.,19 blood cyanide concentrations exhibited a linear
response to increasing doses of cyanide (Figure 6B). Each rabbit that could be considered “exposed”
(i.e., CN concentration levels above 10 μM) was correctly diagnosed
from the analysis of whole blood by the sensor. Moreover, each sample
was analyzed for exposure in under 3 min, and triplicate analysis
of individual rabbits produced measured cyanide concentrations with
a %RSD of ≤12% for all time points. The interanimal variability
observed was expected due to varying physiological characteristics
of individual rabbits (e.g., animal size, levels of rhodanese present,
etc.). Overall, the sensor was 100% accurate in diagnosing cyanide
poisoning for acutely exposed rabbits.

Figure 6 (A) Comparison of the
cyanide concentrations found in the whole
blood of cyanide exposed rabbits at 15, 25, and 35 min into the infusion
period (5, 8.3, and 11.7 mg NaCN exposure, respectively). The dashed
line represents the LLOQ (3.12 μM) and the solid line represents
10 μM cyanide, the threshold considered “cyanide exposure”
for this study. Standard deviation values (±3 s) for the lines
were not presented because they were negligible compared to the scale
of the x axis. Note that for the 15 min time point n = 3 because three animals did not have blood drawn at
that time interval. (B) Dose–response curves for three different
doses of NaCN (5, 8.3, and 11.7 mg) intravenously administered to
rabbits. Error bars represent standard deviation.

Conclusions
A rapid and sensitive cyanide field sensor
was developed based
on the detection of a fluorescent β-isoindole product produced
by the reaction of NDA, taurine, and cyanide. The optimized sensor
consists of a cyanide capture apparatus with two chambers separated
by silicone septa punctured with small bore stainless steel tubing.
This configuration produced a linear range of 1.5–100 μM
with a detection limit of 0.25 μM for aqueous cyanide and a
linear range of 3.13–200 μM with a detection limit of
0.78 μM for rabbit whole blood. None of the potential interferents
produced a signal that could be considered a false positive or negative
for cyanide exposure, and the excellent storage stability of the capture
solution reagents make the described cyanide sensor highly applicable
to field use. Compared to the rapid and/or portable sensors shown
in Table 2, the described sensor has a rapid
analysis time, a biologically relevant detection limit, and no known
interferents. Although the analysis time for this sensor is short,
rapid diagnosis of cyanide may be limited by the collection of blood
(i.e., a finger prick with a lancet and collection of venous blood
by trained personnel would require a significant amount of time).
Studies are underway to link the salivary concentrations of cyanide
with cyanide exposure, eliminating the need for invasive and potentially
lengthy blood collection.

The performance of the sensor, most
importantly the 100% accurate
and rapid (<3 min) diagnosis of cyanide exposure in rabbits, is
promising for the development of a highly robust field-portable sensor
for the accurate diagnosis of cyanide exposure. Further sensor development,
specifically focused on more rapid analysis and miniaturization, is
currently underway.
