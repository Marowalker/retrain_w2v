The increasing analytical
speed of mass-spectrometry imaging (MSI)
has led to growing interest in the medical field. Acute kidney injury
is a severe disease with high morbidity and mortality. No reliable
cut-offs are known to estimate the severity of acute kidney injury.
Thus, there is a need for new tools to rapidly and accurately assess
acute ischemia, which is of clinical importance in intensive care
and in kidney transplantation. We investigated the value of MSI to
assess acute ischemic kidney tissue in a porcine model. A perfusion
model was developed where paired kidneys received warm (severe) or
cold (minor) ischemia (n = 8 per group). First, ischemic
tissue damage was systematically assessed by two blinded pathologists.
Second, MALDI-MSI of kidney tissues was performed to study the spatial
distributions and compositions of lipids in the tissues. Histopathological
examination revealed no significant difference between kidneys, whereas
MALDI-MSI was capable of a detailed discrimination of severe and mild
ischemia by differential expression of characteristic lipid-degradation
products throughout the tissue within 2 h. In particular, lysolipids,
including lysocardiolipins, lysophosphatidylcholines, and lysophosphatidylinositol,
were dramatically elevated after severe ischemia. This study demonstrates
the significant potential of MSI to differentiate and identify molecular
patterns of early ischemic injury in a clinically acceptable time
frame. The observed changes highlight the underlying biochemical processes
of acute ischemic kidney injury and provide a molecular classification
tool that can be deployed in assessment of acute ischemic kidney injury.

==== Body
Acute kidney
injury (AKI) is
associated with high morbidity and mortality and is most often caused
by hypotension or hypoxia in cardiovascular or septic shock.1 AKI also occurs after kidney transplantation
and its extent is associated with later graft function.2 After successful recovery of AKI there is an
increasing incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), with increased
risk for cardiovascular disease.3 At present,
the pathophysiology of AKI is not fully understood, and good biomarkers
to predict the severity of AKI are lacking.1

The aim of this study was to investigate the value of mass-spectrometry
imaging (MSI) in the assessment of the extent of acute ischemic kidney
damage. MSI is an innovative approach enabling the unlabeled molecular
imaging of hundreds of molecules in a single experiment and can allow
the correlation of localized molecular profiles to tissue state and
morphology.4−7 MSI is now finding its way into clinical analyses because of its
ability to reveal localized chemical profiles throughout tissue sections
and discriminate between diseased and healthy tissue by virtue of
these molecular patterns that are characteristic of cell and tissue
types.4,8,9,7 Recent advances in instrumentation enable high-throughput
tissue imaging and analysis times on a scale compatible with conventional
histological analysis.10 This now opens
up the possibility of using localized molecular information to aid
in tissue diagnosis. Lipids present an exciting molecular class to
target with MSI because of the relative ease of detection of many
abundant lipid classes and their relatively simple and rapid sample
preparation.11 In renal research, MSI has
been applied to study localized sphingolipid changes in sphingomyelin-synthase-2-deficient
mice and lipidomic changes after cisplatin chemotherapy. A recent
study has also highlighted lipidomic changes associated with acute
kidney injury.12−14

In this study, we confirm earlier findings
that conventional histopathologic
examination is not sufficient to accurately discriminate the extent
of acute ischemic renal injury.15,16 In contrast, studying
localized lipid profiles with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–mass-spectrometry
imaging (MALDI-MSI) provided accurate discrimination of cold and warm
ischemia via observation of dramatically elevated levels of lysophospholipids
in the case of severe ischemia, with a total analysis time of 1 h
per tissue, including sample preparation. We propose this discriminative
capacity opens up the door for molecular-guided quality assessment
and can provide new insight into the pathophysiologic processes of
ischemic kidney injury.

Experimental Section
Kidney Procurement and
Ischemia Model
We used a paired
porcine-kidney model to distinguish between ischemic injury in kidneys
(see study design in Supporting Information Figure S1). We aimed to develop a system, that can be extrapolated
to clinical transplantation, where in light of the increasing need
of donor organs, kidneys of deceased donors with warm ischemia (i.e.,
in the donor) and cold ischemia (i.e., during transportation) are
increasingly used. Kidneys were procured from a local slaughterhouse
from eight pigs. Both kidneys of one pig were simultaneously procured
15 min after death by electroshock and exsanguination. Perirenal fat
was removed and renal arteries were dissected, cannulated, and attached
to an infusion bag. Kidneys were flushed 25 min after death with cold
histidine–tryptophan–ketoglutarate preservation solution
at 0–4 °C for 20 min. The start of perfusion was documented
as the end of the warm-ischemia time (WIT) and start of cold-ischemia
time (CIT). Simultaneously, topical cooling was performed using cold
sodium chloride solution. Thereafter, both kidneys were stored in
bags with sodium chloride solution and placed in a Styrofoam box with
ice for transport to the laboratory (according to regular organ-transport
protocols).

In our laboratory, kidneys were removed from cold
storage, and after exactly 3 h of CIT, simultaneous hypothermic machine
perfusion (HMP) was started using two Lifeport Kidney Transporters
(model no. LKT-100-P; Organ Recovery Systems, Des Plaines, IL) and
0.5 L of Kidney Perfusion Solution 1 (KPS-1; Organ Recovery Systems,
Des Plaines, IL) per kidney at a perfusion pressure of 40 mmHg, as
is currently used in clinical-transplantation practice. Kidneys were
hypothermically perfused for 1 h at 4 °C. Thereafter, they were
flushed for 15 min to remove all intravascular content and Lifeport
perfusion cassettes, and KPS-1 was discarded. Kidneys of seven of
eight pairs were then randomly assigned to one of two type of perfusion:
HMP for 4 h at 4 °C (cold or mild ischemia) or subnormothermic
machine perfusion (SNMP) for 4 h at 28 °C (warm or severe ischemia).
One pair was not perfused thereafter and directly biopsied (as described
below) to serve as control tissue.

HMP was performed as described
above but with the use of 1 L of
KPS-1 with a mean temperature of 4 °C. For SNMP, a Lifeport Kidney
Transporter was used. The reservoir, normally filled with ice water
for HMP, was filled with water and continuously heated with a heat
exchanger at a constant temperature of 35 °C. This led to a constant
temperature of 28 °C for the KPS-1, in which the kidney was placed
and perfused. Higher (normothermic) temperatures were not possible,
as that would stop the perfusion machine from pumping. After 4 h of
simultaneous machine perfusion (HMP or SNMP), wedge biopsies were
taken. For the two kidneys that were not subject to the two groups,
this was done directly after their first hour of machine perfusion
(Supporting Information Figure S1). Two
large (>1 cm2) wedges were cut in a manner such that
both
medullar and cortical renal tissue was included. One wedge biopsy
was formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) and stored for histopathologic
examination. The other wedge biopsy was snap frozen using a 2-methylbutane
solution and stored at −80 °C for MSI analysis (without
the use of the OCT compound).

To test our presumption of different
metabolic activity between
groups and subsequent ischemic injury, machine perfusate was gathered
during machine perfusion and tested for lactate and lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) as markers of metabolic activity and cellular injury. During
the 4 h of HMP and SNMP, machine perfusate samples were taken at 10,
60, 120, 180, and 240 min. After withdrawal from the Lifeport sampling
port, samples were centrifuged at 3000g for 3 min,
aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. After the samples were
thawed, lactate was measured (mmol/L) using a blood-gas analyzer (GEM
Premier 4000, Instrumentation Laboratory, Lexington, MA). Lactate
dehydrogenase was measured (in U/L), using a Roche Cobas 8000 system
(Roche Diagnostic International Ltd., Rotkreuz, Switzerland).

Histopathologic
Scoring of Tissue Biopsies
FFPE tissues
were sectioned at 4 μm, twice for every kidney. Subsequently
they were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or periodic
acid–Schiff–diastase (PAS-D) according to standard protocols.17 Two nephropathologists (C.J.P.K. and L.M.H.),
blinded for ischemia groups, performed histopathological examination
of all biopsies using light microscopy. For each tissue section, 10
random fields of renal cortex containing at least 1 glomerulus were
assessed at 200× magnification and scored (0–3 point scale:
none, 0; mild, 0–30%; moderate, 30–60%; and severe,
>60%) for five parameters associated with ischemic injury: tubular-cell
necrosis, loss of brush border, edema, tubular casts, and blebs in
tubular epithelial cells. A total injury score was calculated by adding
the scores of all parameters.

Mass-Spectrometry Imaging
(MSI)
Tissue Preparation
Wedge biopsies were collected from
−80 °C storage, mounted on the specimen stage with H2O, sectioned at 12 μm at −21 °C using a
Cryostat HM525 (Microm, Walldorf, Germany), thaw-mounted onto conductive
indium–tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glass slides purchased from Delta
Technologies (Loveland, CO, 4–8 Ω resistance), and dried
under vacuum. On each slide, both kidneys of the same pig were mounted
to ensure similar and comparable analysis during MSI. Norharmane matrix
(Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) at 7 mg/mL in chloroform/methanol
(2:1, v/v) was applied to sections using a SunCollect automatic pneumatic
sprayer (Sunchrom GmbH, Friedrichsdorf, Germany). Fifteen layers were
applied at the following flow rates: 10 μL/min for the first
layer, 20 μL/min for the second layer, 30 μL/min for the
third layer, and 40 μL/min for the fourth and subsequent layers.

Mass-Spectrometry Analysis
MALDI-MSI data were acquired
on a Bruker rapifleX MALDI Tissuetyper (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen,
Germany) in reflectron mode using a nominal acceleration potential
of ±20 kV.10 Data were acquired in
the m/z ranges of 400–1000
and 600–1600 for positive- and negative-ion mode, respectively.
Mass calibration was performed before each analysis using red phosphorus
clusters in positive- and negative-ion mode. Each tissue was imaged
sequentially in positive- and negative-ion mode as recently described.18 Briefly, positive-ion data were first acquired
using a 20 × 20 μm2 laser scan area and a 50
× 50 μm2 step size of the stage. After that,
negative-ion data were acquired with identical parameters but with
a 25 × 25 μm2 offset in stage position applied
to produce an interlaced acquisition pattern. For each slide, the
laser-focus position was optimized and 200 laser shots were acquired
at each position. The total analysis time was approximately 1 h per
tissue in both polarities, including sample preparation time. The
identification of selected lipid species was based on both accurate-mass
measurements and tandem-mass-spectrometry data using collision-induced
dissociation acquired from adjacent tissues using an Orbitrap Elite
mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, Bremen, Germany) coupled to a reduced-pressure
MALDI-MSI source, as recently described.19 Data visualization and analysis was performed using FlexImaging
5.0 (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany), SCiLS lab 2016a (Bruker,
Bremen, Germany), and Xcalibur 2.3 (Thermo Fisher, Bremen, Germany).

Histological Imaging of Tissue-Section Slides after MSI Analysis
After MSI, matrix was washed off using two 30 s submersions in
100% EtOH. Thereafter, H&E staining was performed using a rapid
staining protocol with the use of a Leica linear stainer (Leica ST4020);
the protocol included 10 s submersions in solutions in the following
order: 2 × formaldehyde, 1 × H2O, 3 × hematoxylin,
1 × H2O, 1 × ammoniac water, 1 × tap water,
1 × eosin, 1 × tap water, 2 × 100% EtOH, and 2 ×
Xylene.

Statistical Analysis
Numeric variables
are presented
as means ± standard deviations (SDs) if approximately normally
distributed and as medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs) otherwise.
To measure the differences among perfusate concentrations at the measured
time points (10, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min), we used the Wilcoxon
signed-rank test. To test for differences in cold- and warm-ischemic
injury by histological parameters, we used a Mann–Whitney-U test for all parameters scored, including the total score.
All statistical analysis of MSI data was performed using SCiLS lab
2016a software. For ROC analysis, the mean spectrum from all 16 tissues
was exported to mMass software.20 Peak
picking was performed using a signal-to-noise threshold of 5 with
no baseline corrections or smoothing applied. The generated peak list
was then imported into SCiLS lab 2016a for all subsequent analysis
using an interval width of ±0.25 Da. This was repeated for both
positive- and negative-ion mode. ROC analysis was performed using
the warm- and cold-ischemia tissues (seven tissues each per polarity)
as two groups, and peaks were assigned as being discriminatory with
AUCs >0.8 or <0.2.

Results and Discussion
Association of Ischemia
Severity with Machine-Perfusate Markers
and No Association with Histology
Ten minutes after the start
of perfusion, lactate levels (mmol/L) in the perfusate were not different
between HMP and SNMP kidneys (i.e., cold versus warm ischemia; median
= 0.6 mmol/L (IQR, 0.3–0.7 mmol/L) vs 1.0 mmol/L (IQR, 0.4–1.0
mmol/L), respectively, P = 0.293). As sign of a higher
metabolic activity, the flush-out of lactate was significantly higher
in SNMP kidneys compared with in HMP kidneys over time (median lactate
at 240 min HMP vs SNMP: 1.0 mmol/L (IQR, 0.9–1.1 mmol/L) vs
7.4 mmol/L (IQR, 5.2–9.0 mmol/L), P = 0.018).
As sign of increased ischemic injury in SNMP kidneys, LDH concentrations
(U/L) at baseline were not significantly different (median LDH at
10 min HMP vs SNMP: 5 U/L (IQR, 4–11 U/L) vs 11 U/L (IQR, 8–23
U/L), P = 0.236), but after 4 h of perfusion, they
were (median LDH at 240 min HMP vs SNMP: 56 U/L (IQR, 41–62
U/L) vs 118 U/L (IQR, 61–130 U/L), P = 0.028).
These results are also depicted in Supporting Information Figure S2.

A systematic histopathologic
examination of the renal tissue sections by two blinded renal pathologists
did not discriminate between the different types of ischemia. There
were no significant differences found for scoring of tubular-cell
necrosis, edema, tubular casts, or blebs in tubular epithelial cells,
nor were differences found when combining these scores. One pathologist
was able to find a significant difference between ischemic groups
by scoring the loss of brush border (scores of HMP vs SNMP = 18 (IQR,
16–25) vs 25 (IQR, 23–29), P = 0.024).
The results of this pathologist are depicted in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Comparison of histologic scores of cold and
warm ischemia by a
blinded pathologist. Five parameters were scored, and a total-histologic-score
parameter was calculated by the sum of all five scored parameters.
The Mann–Whitney-U test was applied to test
for differences between groups. A P-value ≤0.05
was considered significant and annotated with an asterisk (*). *Median
score for HMP vs SNMP: 18 (IQR, 16–25) vs 25 (IQR, 23–29), P = 0.024 for the loss of brush border.

We have tested the extent of ischemic kidney injury
especially
in a preclinical porcine model mimicking transplantation. At present,
it is not possible to determine the exact viability of an ischemically
damaged kidney and to estimate whether transplantation will lead to
a successful outcome. There is no consensus on how to select kidneys
suitable for transplantation, because many of the used selection criteria
are only poor or moderate predictors of graft outcome.15,16,21−23 Normothermic
machine perfusion, a promising organ-preservation strategy, is also
used to assess kidneys before transplantation and is increasingly
performed to assess AKI.24−26 In normothermic machine perfusion,
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is utilized to avoid warm ischemia.
Preliminary results show that NMP may even recondition and repair
ischemically damaged tissue.27 We used
machine-perfusate markers to validate the presumed ischemic injury
in our perfusion model. Lactate and LDH confirm ischemic injury and
may therefore also have potential as viability markers. However, these
two markers are often studied for their potential roles as viability
markers and are indeed associated with ischemic injury and functional
outcome, but they do not have predictive value to be used as clinical
markers, as with most perfusate biomarkers thus far.28 At present, renal biopsies are increasingly used to assess
the quality of the potential donor kidney, in which the extent of
chronic histological damage is associated with long-term graft function.15−19 Assessment of acute ischemic damage in pretransplant procurement
biopsies does not have clear additional value.16 This emphasizes the need for additional viability tests
for acute kidney injury that can be used in transplantation. A possible
test may be MSI.

Discrimination between Severe and Mild Ischemic
Injury by MSI
via Lipid-Degradation Products
In positive-ion-mode analysis
of porcine tissues, phosphatidylcholines (PC) and sphingomyelins are
mostly observed as mixtures of protonated, sodiated, and potassiated
forms, a common observation in MSI. Negative-ion mode allows the detection
of a wide variety of acidic lipids, including phosphatidylserines
(PS), phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), phosphatidylglycerols (PG),
phosphatidylinositols (PI), sulfatides (ST), and cardiolipins as predominantly
deprotonated ([M–H]−) ions. The average positive-
and negative-ion spectra acquired from the warm-ischemia, cold-ischemia,
and control kidneys are provided as Supporting Information Figures S3 and S4. We performed a receiver–operator-characteristic
(ROC) analysis to elucidate the discriminatory lipid MSI signals for
ischemic injury in negative-ion mode between m/z 600 and 1600. In total, three monoisotopic m/z signals were found with area-under-the-curve
(AUC) values greater than 0.8 (elevated in warm ischemia) which were
attributed to the three monoisotopic lipids described below and listed
in Table 1.

a Only monoisotopic lipids are shown.
Lipids were identified following ROC analysis of tissues exposed to
cold and warm ischemia. No discriminative ions elevated in the cold-ischemic
tissue were observed.

In
negative-ion mode, an increase in ion signal between m/z 1180 and 1240 was observed for all
tissues with induced warm-ischemic damage (Supporting Information Figure S5). In particular, ions observed at m/z 1185.8 and 1207.8 were elevated in
the warm-ischemia tissue (Figure 2a). The discriminatory m/z 1185.8 ion was assigned by accurate mass to monolysocardiolipin
[MLCL(54:6)–H]−, with the primary molecular
species assigned to [MLCL(18:2_18:2_18:2)–H]− using tandem mass spectrometry. The m/z 1207.8 is assigned to the analogous sodium adduct [MLCL(18:2_18:2_18:2)–2H+Na]−. Interestingly, no corresponding decrease in the most
abundant potential precursor to these MLCL species, namely, CL(72:8)
as [CL(72:8)–H]− and [CL(72:8)–2H+Na]− at m/z 1447.9 and
1669.9, respectively, was observed, although we note that in the absence
of internal standards, quantitative comparisons of ion abundance are
difficult (Supporting Information Figure S6). Furthermore, in negative-ion mode, lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI)
as [LPI(20:4)–H]− at m/z 619.3 was also elevated in tissues exposed to warm ischemia
(Supporting Information Figure S7). No
ions elevated in cold-ischemic or control tissues relative to in warm-ischemic
tissues were observed. Ischemia-related elevation of lysophosphatidylcholine
(LPC) lipids was also observed in positive-ion mode (Table 1 and Supporting Information Figure S8). The distribution of the most abundant
LPC, which was observed at m/z 496.3
([LPC(16:0)+H]+), throughout all 16 tissues is provided
in Figure 2.

discriminatory lipids: mass-spectrometry-imaging data

of the lysolipids (a) [MLCL(54:6)–H]− and
(b) [LPC(16:0)+H]+ through all 16 tissues (7 warm ischemia,
7 cold ischemia, and 2 control). All images are normalized to the
total ion count.

MSI results also suggested
a spatial heterogeneity in the degradation
of cardiolipins in ischemic tissue. To further investigate this we
imaged a warm-ischemic tissue at 20 μm spatial resolution (Figure 3). The distribution
of the [M–H]− ions of CL(72:8), MLCL(54:6),
and the sulfatide ST(d42:1(2OH)) are shown in red, green, and blue,
respectively. Coregistration of the post-MSI H&E-stained tissue
(Figure 3b–d)
revealed the sulfatide signal at m/z 906.5 to be localized in the area of the medullary rays (arrows
in Figure 3a) and in
the juxtaglomerular areas (asterisks in Figure 3e,f). Interestingly, the ischemia-related
MLCL(54:6)-degradation product is not exclusively colocalized with
its most probable precursor, CL(72:8), suggesting that the ischemia-related
breakdown of mitochondrial-specific cardiolipin occurs to greater
extent in distinct tubular areas of the renal cortex (Figure 3b–d).

Potential of MSI as a Viability
Test and as a Way To Gain New
Insights into the Pathophysiology of Ischemic Injury
In a
porcine donor-kidney model, we show that it is feasible to rapidly
visualize ischemic damage in renal tissue on the basis of local lipid
profiles. We are able to visualize and identify alterations in the
lipidome between kidneys with mild and severe ischemic injury using
MSI. The advantage of such molecular analysis likely arises by detection
of the rapid biochemical alterations occurring during acute tissue
injury. This short time frame may not allow significant histological
changes to be induced, leading to the poor accuracy of histological
identification of acute ischemia (e.g., Figure 1). Using MALDI-MSI in this context has two
distinct advantages. First, by rapid assessment of ischemically damaged
kidneys using MSI, it may provide a practical tool to assist in viability
assessment, and therefore, it holds the potential to improve donor-kidney
selection. With the development of rapid MALDI-MSI instrumentation
and automated matrix application, such as those employed in this study,
a single tissue could be analyzed with 50 μm spatial resolution
in 30 min in both positive- and negative-ion modes, which is within
the critical time frame needed for graft-viability assessments in
clinical transplantation, for example. The total analysis time, including
matrix application, is approximately 1 h. Second, in this study, we
have identified multiple discriminative molecules of ischemic injury
not yet described in AKI. In particular, a suite of lysophospholipids
have been identified as significantly elevated in severe ischemia
compared with in mild ischemia. The source of these lysolipids is
likely lipid degradation by increased activation of phospholipase
A1 (PLA1) or A2 (PLA2) enzymes, with the latter in particular having
been previously shown to exhibit elevated activation during ischemia.29−33 Although much more is known about
the PLA2 family of enzymes, the differentiation of PLA1- and PLA2-driven
hydrolysis is not generally possible using MSI or indeed conventional
MS-based lipidomics.34 MSI typically lacks
the isomeric specificity required to localize the sn positions of the acyl chains on both the precursor and the lyso-lipid
products, which is essential for differentiating PLA1- and PLA2-based
processes. Thus, our results likely reflect the cumulative effects
of all PLA forms. The observation of degradation of both mitochondrial
lipids (cardiolipin) and membrane lipids (PC, PI, and PE; also observed
in the high-resolution Orbitrap analysis) may be reflective of different
forms and activations of PLA1–PLA2 in renal ischemia that lead
to the disruption of cell membranes.35−37 Therefore, MSI shows
potential in identifying new molecules, which may play an important
role in AKI assessment. Furthermore, it offers new insights in molecular
pathways of ischemic injury and may even reveal novel targets for
diagnostics and therapeutics that reduce ischemic injury.

Identification
of Lipid-Degradation Products as Ischemic Markers
by MSI
Using MSI, we were able to identify surrogate markers
of ischemic processes such as MLCL, LPC, and LPI in kidney tissue
with severe ischemia. Interference with cardiolipin activity has already
shown to be beneficial in chronic renal damage in tubular and endothelial
cells in the context of ischemia reperfusion as well as in the context
of revascularization in renal-artery stenosis.38,38 Cardiolipins are located in the inner membranes of mitochondria
and are needed for protection of mitochondrial cristae and ATP generation.
Ischemia reperfusion-induced mitochondrial injury plays a pivotal
role in organ viability in transplantation40 and is associated with kidney injury.41,42 Next to the
kidney, cardiolipins are also involved in ischemia reperfusion injury
in other organs, like the brain,32 heart,43 and liver.44 Moreover,
the action of mitochondrial-specific PLA2 forms has been shown to
result in further lipid mediators in ischemia that have further detrimental
effects on tissue quality.45 We now are
the first to rapidly measure and visualize elevated levels of MLCL
in ischemic renal tissue in a clinically acceptable time frame, which
may pave to the way to cardiolipin measurements in, for instance,
assessment of graft viability.

Other important lysolipids that
we identified in association with severe renal ischemia are LPCs and
LPIs. Increased expression of LPCs has been described in other ischemic
tissue, like liver tissue (including graft biopsies of DCD donors)46 and heart tissue.47 In renal ischemia, proximal tubules show increased expression of
PI on their apical membranes.48,49 Elevated LPC levels
were also found in renal ischemia.50,51 The function
of LPCs is not fully understood, but in ischemic conditions they can,
for example, increase tubular secretion of the pro-fibrotic factors
PDGF-B and CTGF.52 LPCs are hydrolyzed
from PCs following removal of fatty acyl chains by PLA1 or PLA2 from
the sn-1 and sn-2 positions, respectively.
PLA2 activity has been described as being altered in renal ischemia
reperfusion injury, which can lead to differential cytotoxic or cytoprotective
effects on renal tubular cells.30,35−37 Thus, we have visualized expression of compounds in ischemic processes,
which are confirmed by the literature,38,39,48−51 in an early stage of loss of organ viability within
a very short time frame in which morphological changes are difficult
to observe. This holds the potential to aid in assessment of AKI,
risk prediction for CKD, and ultimately the improvement of outcomes.

Limitations of the Study Model
Within the current porcine
model, we compared two degrees of ischemic injury that were based
on clinical transplantation: 4 h of cold perfusion (mild ischemia)
versus 4 h of subnormothermic (warm) perfusion (severe ischemia).
The difference in metabolic activity and cell injury is shown by our
perfusate analyses. The clinical value of the current study needs
further investigation in animal models of AKI in relation to outcome
and in human kidney biopsies. Thus, future studies are needed to study
alterations in human biopsies in recipients for whom the transplant
outcome is known. Furthermore, in human biopsies, chronic histological
damage in relation to inflammation and fibrosis may also be present
(in contrast to the young pigs we studied), and thus lipid patterns
may differ. Also, studies with MSI in relation to the pathophysiology
of the AKI-to-CKD transition will increase our pathophysiological
insights herein and provide novel diagnostic strategies to decrease
kidney failure.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
shown that MSI shows great potential as
new tool to assess ischemic injury. In this study, we were able to
discriminate moderately and severely ischemically injured kidneys
for every pair analyzed. MSI has the capacity of identifying discriminatory
molecular patterns of ischemic kidney injury in a clinically acceptable
time frame. In addition to histopathological examination, it provides
useful information on the biochemical changes during ischemia relative
to tissue morphology. Furthermore, we have identified lipid molecules
using MSI, which may potentially serve as markers for acute kidney
injury and transplant-outcome predictions.
