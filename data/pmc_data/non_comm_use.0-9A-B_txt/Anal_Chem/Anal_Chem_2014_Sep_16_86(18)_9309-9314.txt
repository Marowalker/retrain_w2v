High throughput screening (HTS) is
important for identifying molecules
with desired properties. Mass spectrometry (MS) is potentially powerful
for label-free HTS due to its high sensitivity, speed, and resolution.
Segmented flow, where samples are manipulated as droplets separated
by an immiscible fluid, is an intriguing format for high throughput
MS because it can be used to reliably and precisely manipulate nanoliter
volumes and can be directly coupled to electrospray ionization (ESI)
MS for rapid analysis. In this study, we describe a “MS Plate
Reader” that couples standard multiwell plate HTS workflow
to droplet ESI-MS. The MS plate reader can reformat 3072 samples from
eight 384-well plates into nanoliter droplets segmented by an immiscible
oil at 4.5 samples/s and sequentially analyze them by MS at 2 samples/s.
Using the system, a label-free screen for cathepsin B modulators against
1280 chemicals was completed in 45 min with a high Z-factor (>0.72) and no false positives (24 of 24 hits confirmed).
The assay revealed 11 structures not previously linked to cathepsin
inhibition. For even larger scale screening, reformatting and analysis
could be conducted simultaneously, which would enable more than 145 000
samples to be analyzed in 1 day.

==== Body
High throughput screening (HTS)
is important in drug discovery, chemical biology, and chemistry. Current
technology relies mostly on performing assay reactions in multiwell
plates (MWP) with robotic manipulation of fluids followed by interrogation
using optical plate-readers.1,2 Mass spectrometry (MS)
is a potentially powerful technique for HTS because it is fast, has
high resolution, and can detect chemicals without labels.3,4 This latter advantage is important because it eliminates false signals
based on a label or indicator reaction and avoids the time, expense,
and expertise needed to modify target compounds for optical assay.
Use of MS in screening5−8 has often relied on the multiplexing capability to test mixtures
of compounds; however, this use is limited because most chemical libraries
are formatted as arrays of individual compounds and most screening
is performed by testing one compound on one reaction at a time. MS
is not commonly used for such screening because traditional sample
introduction methods are too slow; although advances have been made
with high flow rate separation and multiplexed autosamplers.9,10 As we describe here, a way to overcome this limitation is use of
segmented flow sample introduction to enable label-free HTS by electrospray
ionization (ESI)-MS.

Segmented flow and other formats wherein
aqueous sample droplets
are compartmentalized within an oil carrier fluid have seen a resurgence
of interest due to advances in microfluidic manipulation tools.11−16 Although most droplet experiments rely on optical detection, ESI-MS
can also be used to analyze droplets.17−23 Droplet sample introduction for MS allows fast analysis and greatly
reduced sample consumption, suggesting potential for HTS. Despite
this potential, no reports have demonstrated the robustness needed
for screening many compounds. Instead, experiments have focused on
methods of interfacing droplets to MS or small scale screens of a
few compounds under conditions not compatible with HTS. A potential
approach to HTS by droplet MS is to complete entire screening reactions
at the droplet level yielding both label-free detection and miniaturization.18 However, a substantial infrastructure investment
in MWP-based technology suggests that it is also of interest to combine
such tools with MS, i.e., to develop a “MS plate reader”.
Herein we describe coupling MWP-based fluid manipulation with segmented
flow ESI-MS to rapidly screen a compound library. The approach utilizes
a two-step process of reformatting MWP samples into droplets and then
infusion into ESI-MS.

The system is applied to cathepsin B,24 a cysteine protease implicated in tumorigenesis,
arthritis, and
parasite infection.25−28 Both in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that certain
cathepsin B inhibitors reduce tumor cell motility and invasiveness.29,30 Because of these links, considerable effort has been made to identify
cathepsin B inhibitors. Successful inhibitors include epoxysuccinyl,
aziridinyl, biguanide, and β-lactam derivatives.31,32 The MS screen used here reveals several potential new inhibitors.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals and Materials
Unless otherwise specified,
all solvents were purchased from Honeywell Burdick & Jackson (Muskegon,
MI) and were certified ACS grade or better. Reagents were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Peptides used for cathepsin B
assay were synthesized by Pierce Biotechnology, Inc. (Rockford, IL).
Compounds for cathepsin B screening were from Prestwick Chemical Library
(Prestwick Chemical, Washington, DC), provided by the Center of Chemical
Genomics of University of Michigan.

Parallel Droplet Generation
Oil-segmented droplets
of 50 nL each were created in parallel from eight 384-well plates
into eight 0.01 in. i.d. × 1/16 in. o.d. fluorinated ethylene
propylene (FEP) tubes (IDEX Health and Science, Oak, Harbor, WA).
A 2 cm 100 μm i.d. × 238 μm o.d. fused-silica capillary,
sealed with Sticky Wax (KerrLab, Orange, CA), was inserted into the
inlet of each FEP tube to act as a “sipper”. Capillaries
were fluorinated by pumping 1:100 (v/v) trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane in anhydrous hexadecane
through them. Samples in 384-well plates (Nunc 384-Well ShallowWell
plates, Thermo Scientific) were covered with perfluorodecalin (PFD,
95% purity, Acros Organics, NJ). The edges of plates were built-up
to 5 mm height with epoxy to hold PFD over the wells.

For droplet
formation, the 384-well plates and the inlets of the FEP tubes were
mounted onto a computer numerical control (CNC) machine (Cameron Micro
Drill Press, Sonora, CA) so that a sipper was above the first well
on each plate. The other end of FEP tubes were connected to 500 μL
Hamilton syringes (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), which were
mounted on a multichannel syringe pump (Fusion 400, Chemyx Inc. Stafford,
TX). The syringes and FEP tubes were prefilled with PFD. As the syringes
were aspirating at 4 μL/min, the G-code programmed CNC machine
controlled the movement of tubes and plates so that the sipper could
alternatively dwell in sample for 1 s and in oil for 0.25 s, as well
as move from sample to sample for 0.5 s. Droplets with 50 nL volume
separated by equal size of oil were produced with these parameters.

Mass Spectrometry Analysis
A Micromass Quattro Ultima
triple quadrupole MS (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) was used for
analysis. The original stainless steel ESI needle was replaced by
a piece of fused silica capillary (18 cm in length, 100 μm i.d.
× 238 μm o.d.) coated on the outside with gold and with
the inner surface fluorinated as described above for sipper capillaries.
The FEP tube containing sample droplets was connected to the treated
ESI needle with a 1/16 in. bore VICI Cheminert union (Valco Instruments
Co. Inc. Houston, TX).

For analysis, a syringe pump drove sample
droplets through the needle into the source. ESI voltage was +2.5
to 3.0 kV, the source was heated to 100 °C, the cone gas was
set at 50 L/h, the desolvation gas was 200 L/h, and the nebulizing
gas was adjusted to the best flow based on the infusing rate of droplets.
The ESI mode and the MS method were dependent upon molecules to be
analyzed. Extracted ion currents (XICs) of target molecules were obtained
by MassLynx (Version 4.1, Waters Inc.). Sample droplets are detected
as bursts of current in the XICs because the oil, being not conductive
or charged, does not generate an ESI-MS signal.

Cathepsin B
Assay
The assay was developed starting
from a previous report.18 The nonfluorogenic
peptide GFGFVGG was used as the substrate for cathepsin, which yields
FVGG as a product (Figure S3a, Supporting Information). Reactions were performed in 20 mM ammonium formate and 200 μM
1,3-dithioerythritol (DTE) buffer. Reactions were stopped with equal
volume of quenchant consisting of ice-cold 50% methanol, 50% water,
and 0.3% formic acid (v/v). The quenchant also contained a 20 μM
stable isotope labeled product (FVG*G, +3 Da) as the internal standard.
The buffer is MS compatible, which allows direct infusion analysis.
To determine the linearity of the reaction rate, assays containing
final concentrations of 50 nM cathepsin B and 100 μM substrate
were incubated for 0, 15, 25, 35, 45, 65, and 90 min. To determine
Michaelis–Menten kinetics, the substrate concentration was
varied from 0 to 400 μM while quenching the reaction at different
time points from 0 to 90 min. The Km value
was fit by Michaelis–Menten model using GraphPad Prism 6.01.

High Throughput Cathepsin B Inhibitor Screening
To
screen the Prestwick Library, 8 μL of 100 μM GFGFVGG was
deposited into each well of four 384-well standard assay plates (Greiner
Bio-One, Monroe, NC) by Multidrop Combi (Thermo Scientific, Waltham,
MA). 50 nL of 5 mM test compounds from the Prestwick Library (1280
chemicals) was then added with a Caliper Life Sciences Sciclone ALH
3000 Workstation (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Two microliters of 0.25
μM cathepsin B was deposited into the mixture afterward. The
final concentrations were 80 μM GFGFVGG, 50 nM cathepsin B,
and 25 μM test compound. 0.5% Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was
present in each reaction. After incubation at 37 °C for 25 min,
reactions were quenched with 10 μL of ice-cold quenchant. In
total, 1408 reactions, including 64 negative controls (DMSO) and 64
positive controls (25 μM E-64), were performed. Assay plates
were then spun to remove air bubbles. All mixtures were finally transferred
into 384-well readout plates with elevated edges by a Biomek FXP Laboratry Automation Workstation (Beckman Coulter, Brea,
CA). Samples were reformatted to droplets as described above. Each
sample was collected as 3 droplets in sequence. Four FEP tubes of
1 m length were used for each plate. Droplet and oil gap had equal
volume of 75 nL. The analysis was performed using ESI-MS in multiple
reaction monitoring with m/z transition
379.5→247.1 for FVGG and 382.5→247.1 for FVG*G. The
collision energy was set as 18 eV, dwell time was 0.01 s, and interchannel
delay was 0.01 s for both transitions. The ESI voltage was +2.7 kV.
Droplets in FEP tubes were pumped into the sample cone at 15 μL/min.
Droplet traces were acquired by MassLynx and processed with Origin
8.5.

Hits Validation
Inhibitor hits were tested by dose
dependent experiments, which were performed under the same condition
as the screening. Each reaction contained a test compound from 0.1
μM to 100 μM (unless shown otherwise on the data plots).
Peak height ratio of the product FVGG and the isotopic standard FVG*G
were used for analysis. The data were normalized to a control reaction
that contained no inhibitor. Such normalization accounted for variation
in reaction yield seen from day to day, possibly due to enzyme variation
during storage. Fluorescent assays were also performed (see details
in the Supporting Information) to corroborate
our finding. IC50 values were obtained from dose response
curves, which were fitted by GraphPad Prism 6.01.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 illustrates the two-step process
for plate reading by segmented flow ESI-MS. Samples are first reformatted
from a MWP to droplets arranged sequentially in a fluorinated ethylene
propylene (FEP) tube and segmented by perfluorodecalin (PFD) carrier
fluid. The segmented array of samples are then pumped directly into
a metal-coated fused silica capillary that acts as the ESI needle
(Figure 1b).19 The
inner surface of the capillary is fluorinated so that it is wetted
by the PFD. ESI voltage is applied continuously but electrospray stops
and starts with each aqueous plug that exits the channel. The off-axis
MS inlet prevents PFD, which is nebulized but does not form charged
droplets, from entering the MS inlet (Figure 1b); thus a separation of oil and sample occurs in the gas phase.
Mass spectra obtained for segmented samples are comparable to direct
infusion and we do not detect signals that can be attributed to PFD
at any time during infusion of samples (Figure S1, Supporting Information), suggesting effective separation and
no detrimental effects of oil on the MS performance.

Figure 1 (a) Left: scheme of parallel
oil-segmented droplet generation from
MWPs. FEP tubes are programmed to dwell in sample or oil for predetermined
time, and then move to another well. The syringe pump operates in
refill mode at a constant flow rate. Right: picture of parallel droplets
generation with different color food dye as samples. (b) Diagram of
ESI-MS analysis by direct infusion of segmented flow. Droplets are
pumped into the ESI source through a treated ESI needle. ESI voltage
is applied on the needle. In the gas phase, charged sample droplets
(green) enter the MS and nebulized oil (yellow) does not.

Rate of analysis by ESI-MS
We first examined the rate
of ESI-MS possible. The rate of mass spectra acquisition sets the
ultimate limit for analysis rate. The highest scan rate of the MS
used for this work is 62 scans/s for single reaction monitoring and
27 scans/s for monitoring two reactions. For quantitative analysis,
it was desirable to obtain 6–8 scans per droplet, which means
that the analysis rate can be up to 5 Hz (i.e., 5 samples/s) for measuring
a single ion and 2 Hz for two ions (assuming a 1:1 ratio of sample:oil).
For 50 nL droplets, the MS-limited rate of 5 Hz could be achieved
with an infusion flow rate of 30 μL/min. This rate produced
stable traces and reproducible detection of a select ion showing that
the ESI can stop and start at such rates. We could reliably infuse
up to 500 droplets at a time, the largest read length tested.

Analysis rate is also affected by the amount of carry-over that can
be tolerated because we found a link between carry-over in the MS
signals and analysis rate. For example, for 5 μM adenosine followed
by a blank droplet we detected no carry-over at 1 sample/s; but 10%
at 2 samples/s and 20–30% at 4 samples/s (Figure 2). We observed no cross-contamination between droplets within
the storage tubes as visualized by dyes, presumably due to low partition
coefficients into the carrier fluid and wetting of the FEP surface
by PFD. Therefore, the carry-over may be due to cross-droplet contamination
occurring during transfer from FEP to ESI needle, within the needle,
or in the gas phase. With the present system, carry-over can be reduced
by decreasing the analysis rate or by introducing replicate samples.
In the latter case, contamination becomes negligible after the first
droplet so that averaging the signal from 3 droplets gives good quantification.
Use of triplicate samples also provides redundancy for cases where
a noise spike affects a measurement.

Figure 2 Carry-over evaluation at different analysis
rate. Five micromolar
adenosine and solvent (20% methanol, 0.1% formic acid) alternating
droplets (5 each) were infused into the ESI source for analysis. At
0.9 Hz, the carry-over is almost zero; at 1.8 Hz, it increases to
10%; at 3.6 Hz, it becomes as high as 20–30%. Red arrows indicate
solvent droplet that contains signal due to carry-over.

Rate of Droplet Formation
It is
necessary to have rapid
reformatting from MWP to droplets for overall high throughput. Previous
reports demonstrated up to 0.15 droplets/s for forming segmented arrays
from MWP, which would be rate limiting in this case;33 therefore, we explored increasing the rate of this step.
Reformatting followed the general procedure previously described for
PCR in droplets.34 In this method, samples
in a MWP are covered with a continuous layer of oil. The tip of a
FEP tube, connected at the opposite end to a syringe operated in withdraw
mode, is moved from well-to-well to generate samples separated by
oil segments. Fast movement and high aspiration rate contribute to
high droplet generation rate. Using an aspiration rate of 4 μL/min
allowed at least 400 droplets of 50 nL to be formed inside a 90 cm
long tube at a rate of 0.58 Hz and a droplet size relative standard
deviation (RSD) <5% (Figure S2, Supporting
Information). A higher aspiration rate tended to produce progressively
smaller droplets as the tube was filled, likely due to increased leaking
as the flow resistance increased with more droplets. To prevent droplet
generation from being rate limiting, tubes can be operated in parallel.
For example, we operated 8 tubes simultaneously to give an overall
sample generation rate of 4.5 Hz with an RSD of droplet size across
tubes <10% (Figure S2, Supporting Information).

Screening
Although we have previously demonstrated
an MS assay for cathepsin B,18 it was necessary
to identify appropriate conditions and validate the assay for HTS.
The assay used the heptapeptide GFGFVGG (Figure S3, Supporting Information), a sequence representing the proteolytic
preference of cathepsin B, as the substrate.35 We elected to monitor the product peptide (FVGG) as increases on
its low background were easier to measure than decreases in the substrate
peptide. A stable-isotope labeled product peptide was added to the
assay mixture as an internal standard, so that any changes in ionization
efficiency caused by test compounds or drift in the MS signal would
not affect quantification of the reaction. Calibration curves for
detection of product peptide, measured as a ratio to the internal
standard, were linear from 0 to 500 μM in the quenched assay
solvent (Figure S3c, Supporting Information). The rate of product formation was linear for 60 min when using
50 nM cathepsin B and 100 μM substrate (Figure S3d, Supporting Information). Michaelis–Menten
analysis yielded a Km of 270 ± 34
μM (Figure S3e, Supporting Information). Based on the kinetic studies, each screening reaction contained
a final concentration of 50 nM cathepsin B and 80 μM substrate,
below the Km, and was incubated for 25
min to ensure linear reaction velocity. These conditions satisfy the
requirements for HTS.1,36

Assay conditions were validated
with a 24-compound pilot screen including 4 known inhibitors: E-64
(l-trans-3-carboxyoxiran-2-carbonyl-l-leucylagmatine), leupeptin (acetyl-Leu-Leu-Arg-al, N-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-argininal), antipain [(S)-1-carboxy-2-phenylethyl]carbamoyl-l-arginyl-l-valyl-argininal) and chymostatin (N-(Nα-carbonyl-[S,S]-α-(2-iminohexahydro-4-pyrimidyl)glycine-X-Phe-al)-Phe,
X = Leu, Val, or Ile) at 25 μM each. All of these compounds
were detected as inhibitors in the pilot screen and dose response
curves of those 4 inhibitors yielded expected IC50 values
(Figure S4, Supporting Information). These
results suggest that the assay conditions do not adversely affect
kinetics of the reaction or performance of known inhibitors.

We used this system to screen the Prestwick Chemical Library, which
consists of 1280 FDA-approved drugs, against cathepsin B. The screen
used standard MWP fluid manipulation for creating the reaction mixtures
in 384-well plates and therefore can be incorporated into existing
MWP screening systems. Performing the assay reaction, including reagent
dispensing, incubation, and transferring to detection plates, took
1 h. The 1408 reaction mixtures (1280 test compounds and 128 controls)
were reformatted into 4224 droplets of 70 ± 7 nL. Droplets were
generated at 0.5 Hz/tube and MS analysis was conducted continuously
at 1.6 Hz yielding stable signals (Figures 3 and S5, Supporting Information). The
analysis of all sample droplets took ∼45 min. Carry-over was
lower than 15% from droplet to droplet during the screen, which did
not affect the analysis of triplicate samples (Figure S5, Supporting Information). The assay was robust,
as the Z-factors of all plates were above 0.72. Although
adding detection of isotope-labeled internal standard required a slower
MS scan rate, it was necessary to correct ion suppression and signal
drift. For example, reanalysis of the data revealed that if internal
standard had not been used, 3 hits would be missed and 12 noninhibitors
would be assigned as hits because of such signal variations.

Figure 3 (a) Top: droplet
traces of partial cathepsin B inhibitor screening
(Plate #4, 320 test compounds, 16 negative controls (−), and
16 positive controls (+)). Each reaction is analyzed in triplicate.
The analysis rate is 1.6 Hz (1056 droplets detected in 670 s). Bottom:
enlarged view of 550–670 s. Inhibitors (blue arrows) are identified
by the low intensity ratio of FVGG/FVG*G. (b) Top: the analysis result

negative control is normalized to 100% activity. Bottom: last 135
reactions and controls (green). Inhibitors (red) are identified by
the low % of activity (n = 3).

Among 1280 test compounds, 9 reduced the reaction yield more
than
50% and 15 inhibited the reaction ∼40%. Interestingly, all
hits were confirmed by dose response assays (Figures 4 and S6, Supporting Information) showing a low false positive rate. The dose response curves all
had R2 values of 0.92 or better, indicating
reasonable fits to the expected sigmoid. To further validate the results,
we performed fluorescent assays on several of these hits to test results
in an orthogonal assay (Figure S7, Supporting
Information). The tested compounds all yielded dose response
curves in both assays with similar IC50 values. Variation
may be attributed at least in part to use of different substrates
for the assays.

Figure 4 Dose response curves of some of the identified inhibitors.
(a)
Drugs proved to inhibit cathepsins or treat cathepsin-related diseases.42 The reported IC50 of chlorhexidine
is 40 μM.37 The reported inhibition
efficiency of luteolin is reducing the activity of cathepsin B by
60% at 40 μM.38 (b) Drugs that reduced
the yield >40% in the primary screen but had no previous link to
cathepsins
(n = 3).

Of the 24 chemicals that reduced the reaction yield 40% or
more,
4 were known cathepsin or cysteine proteases inhibitors (chlorhexidine,
luteolin, ethacrynic acid, and disulfiram). Their inhibition efficiency
is comparable to the published values.37−39 Another 6 hits (triclabendazole,
hexachlorophene, anthralin, raloxifene, triclosan, and diacerein)
have not been reported as cathepsin inhibitors, but are used to treat
diseases in which cathepsins play a role. For example, triclabendazole
is used to treat liver flukes, which secrete cathepsins.40,41

The cathepsin inhibitory effect of the other 14 hits has yet
to
be studied, which suggests potential new therapeutic use for these
compounds. Among them, 3 contain known “warheads” of
small molecule cathepsin B inhibitors (cefmetazole and cefaclor are
β-lactams and alexidine contains a biguanide32). The remaining 11 hits do not contain structural motifs
established as cathepsin B inhibitors, suggesting an opportunity to
develop modulators based on novel moieties.

Higher Throughput
In principle, this system can sustain
high throughput for a large number of samples. For example, 3072 droplets
can be created from eight 384-well plates within 12 min and analyzed
in 26 min. Switching tubes from aspiration to MS manually required
4 min for 8 tubes. By overlapping droplet generation of the new batch
with the analysis of the previous one, 147 456 droplets could
be analyzed in 24 h, suggesting the potential for ultrahigh throughput
MS analysis. The switching of tubes could be automated for faster
analysis. Improving the read length could also reduce the number of
times that this step is required further improving throughput.

Comparison
to Other MS Screens
MS has emerged as a
useful tool for HTS in a variety of ways. Some approaches take advantage
of multiplexing to screen many compounds in one reaction and use MS
to help sort the results.5−8 Although multiplexing was not demonstrated here,
the rapid readout of the droplet-based approach could be used to help
further speed up multiplexed assays. Most ESI-MS-based screening systems
incorporate liquid chromatography or solid-phase extraction.9,43,47 These systems have reported assay
rates up to 1 sample/8 s, thus, the droplet ESI-MS method here can
operate at over 10 times higher throughput, but is restricted to assays
that can be run in solvents that are compatible with ESI-MS. Matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS)
has also been used for screening. The sample preparation is relatively
easier and a higher level salt can be tolerated. The throughput of
MALDI-based assay is typically around 1–2 min.44−46

Conclusion
These results demonstrate that droplet ESI-MS
has the robustness
and throughput to be used for HTS applications. The system provided
reliable results for over 4000 samples in a HTS workflow. The low
false positives and identification of novel compounds support the
idea that high-throughput, droplet-based ESI-MS can be a powerful
tool for label-free screening. Although the current droplet system
has higher throughput than systems that use solid-phase extraction
or LC,43,47 it is restricted to assays that can be performed
in ESI-MS compatible buffers. Although many targets will likely be
compatible with such buffers, this limitation does suggest that future
work should be directed toward methods of rapid sample cleanup, e.g.,
parallel solid-phase microextraction48 or
in-plate solid-phase extraction49,50 so that the high throughput
capability could be used with a wider range of assays. Another important
advantage relative to current MS-based methods is that this approach
uses miniscule fractions of a sample and therefore could be compatible
with lower volume, higher density well plates for reduction of reagent
consumption. Overall, these results suggest that the droplet-based
method adds to or complements existing MS screening systems.
