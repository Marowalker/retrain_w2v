Efficient
delivery of therapeutic macromolecules and nanomaterials
into the nucleus is imperative for gene therapy and nanomedicine.
Nucleocytoplasmic molecular transport, however, is tightly regulated
by the nuclear pore complex (NPC) with the hydrophobic transport barriers
based on phenylalanine and glycine repeats. Herein, we apply scanning
electrochemical microscopy (SECM) to quantitatively study the permeability
of the NPCs to small probe ions with a wide range of hydrophobicity
as a measure of their hydrophobic interactions with the transport
barriers. Amperometric detection of the redox-inactive probe ions
is enabled by using the ion-selective SECM tips based on the micropipet-
or nanopipet-supported interfaces between two immiscible electrolyte
solutions. The remarkably high ion permeability of the NPCs is successfully
measured by SECM and theoretically analyzed. This analysis demonstrates
that the ion permeability of the NPCs is determined by the dimensions
and density of the nanopores without a significant effect of the transport
barriers on the transported ions. Importantly, the weak ion–barrier
interactions become significant at sufficiently high concentrations
of extremely hydrophobic ions, i.e., tetraphenylarsonium and perfluorobutylsulfonate,
to permeabilize the NPCs to naturally impermeable macromolecules.
Dependence of ion-induced permeabilization of the NPC on the pathway
and mode of macromolecular transport is studied by using fluorescence
microscopy to obtain deeper insights into the gating mechanism of
the NPC as the basis of a new transport model.

==== Body
Molecular transport between
the nucleus and cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell is solely controlled
by the nuclear pore complex (NPC).1 The
NPC plays imperative roles in gene expression1,2 and
gene delivery3 to be linked to many human
diseases and their therapeutics.4 Structurally,
the NPC is composed of the multiple copies of the distinct 30 proteins
called nucleoporins (nups) to form a nanopore with an inner diameter
of ∼50 nm along a length of ∼35 nm through the double-membraned
nuclear envelope (NE).5 This large nanopore
is highly attractive for gene therapy and nanomedicine, which require
the efficient and safe nuclear import of the large conjugates of nucleic
acids with polymers,3 nanoparticles,6 etc., as vectors. This chemical task, however,
is very challenging because the NPC usually mediates the passive transport
of only small molecules and proteins with molecular weights of <∼40
kDa.7 Larger macromolecules are blocked
by the hydrophobic transport barriers based on the phenylalanine-glycine
(FG) repeats of various nups in the nanopore. Therefore, passively
impermeable nuclear proteins must be tagged with nuclear localization
signal (NLS) peptides to be chaperoned through the NPC by nuclear
transport receptors, i.e., importins. For instance, the NLS of a cargo
protein is recognized by importin α (62 kDa), which also binds
to importin β (98 kDa) to form a heterodimer with the maximum
dimension of 19 nm and a radius of gyration of 5.7 nm.8 Intriguingly, the even larger importin–cargo complexes
can overcome the transport barriers, which has been ascribed to the
interactions of importin β with FG repeats.9,10

Recent structural11,12 and transport13,14 studies of the NPC indicated that the interior of the NPC is concentrically
divided into central and peripheral routes by hydrophobic FG-rich
nups to spatially regulate molecular transport at the nanometer scale
(Figure 1A). For instance, the central zone
of the NPC of the Xenopus laevis oocyte is occupied
by the FG domain that is assembled around Nup98 (Figure 1B) and anchored to cytoplasmic filaments by Nup214.15 The central domain also includes the helices
of the Nup54/Nup62 complex projected from the flexible ring of the
Nup54/Nup58 complex.16 Intrinsically, the
FG-based barrier of Nup98 blocks not only passively impermeable macromolecules
but also importin–cargo complexes.17,18 Thus, these complexes are transported through the peripheral route
between the central domain and the pore wall.13,14 In fact, importin-facilitated transport is nearly completely prevented
by wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)19 with a
small radius of ∼2.5 nm,20 which
plugs the peripheral zone21 through binding
to the N-acetylglucosamine groups of Nup62.12 This pathway-selective transport, however, is
not well understood mechanistically or controllable by an external
factor despite its importance for rational design of nuclear gene
delivery for therapeutics and other applications.

dotted lines, respectively. C and N represent cytoplasmic and nucleus
sides, respectively. NE is the nuclear envelope. (B) Cytoplasmic top
view (left) and side view (right) of the NPC with FG-rich nups forming

In this work, we apply scanning electrochemical microscopy22,23 (SECM) to determine the permeability of the NPCs to small probe
ions with a wide range of hydrophobicity as a measure of their interactions
with the hydrophobic transport barriers. In contrast to our previous
SECM studies of the NPC,14,24 its permeability to
redox-inactive probe ions is measured in this study by using the SECM
tips based on the interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions
(ITIES).25 In comparison to metal SECM
tips, the ITIES-based tips have such advantages as diverse ion selectivity,26,27 robustness,28 and extremely small size29 to serve as a powerful tool for biological studies.30 Specifically, a micro-ITIES is formed at the
∼1 μm-diameter tip of the glass pipet filled with a water-immiscible
1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) solution to amperometrically detect an aqueous
target ion at nanometer distances from the NE (Figure 2A). The tip–NE nanogaps are required for precise SECM
measurement of high membrane permeability27 and are formed by smoothening the rough orifice of a heat-pulled
pipet using focused ion-beam (FIB) milling27,31 (Figure 2B,C). In addition, we apply nanopipet-supported
ITIES tips32,33 to attempt the study of single
NPC permeability.

the NE

detach the NE from the nucleoplasm for smoothening. (B) SEM and (C)
FIB images of a milled micropipet. Scale bars, 1 μm.

Importantly, this study leads to the novel finding
that the NPC
is permeabilized with pathway selectivity to naturally impermeable
macromolecules in the presence of high concentrations of extremely
hydrophobic ions, i.e., tetraphenylarsonium (TPhAs+) and
perfluorobutylsulfonate (PFBS–) although their interactions
with transport barriers are too weak to be detected by SECM (see Results and Discussion). We employ fluorescence
microscopy to demonstrate that the ion-induced nuclear import of bovine
serum albumin (BSA; ∼67 kDa) is mediated through the peripheral
route and is blocked by WGA. In addition, the central route is permeabilized
to the importin complex of NLS-tagged BSA, which is no longer blocked
by WGA. To explain this pathway- and mode-dependent permeabilization,
we propose the new transport model based on distinct structures of
central and peripheral transport barriers (Figure 1). Significantly, our model implies that the peripheral route
is blocked by more flexible transport barriers to be more readily
permeabilized for the efficient nuclear import of therapeutic macromolecules
and nanomaterials. We argue that the peripheral route has been explored
for gene therapy and nanomedicine although the use of the peripheral
pathway has been unnoticed.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
Poly(vinyl
pyrrolidone) (PVP; average molecular
weight, 40 kDa), nonafluorobutanesulfonic acid, LiPF6,
tetraphenylarsonium chloride (TPhAsCl), LiClO4, tetrabutylammonium
(TBA+) chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), and chlorotrimethylsilane
(≥99%) were purchased from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). The PF6 salt of (ferrocenylmethyl)trimethyl ammonium (FcTMA+) was prepared by metathesis of its iodide salt (Strem Chemicals,
Newburyport, MA) and NH4PF6 (Strem Chemicals).
The tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate salt of tetradodecylammonium
was obtained by metathesis and used as organic supporting electrolytes.
Deionized water (18.2 MΩ·cm; Nanopure, Barnstead, Dubuque,
IA) was used to prepare the mock intracellular buffer solution at
pH 7.4 containing 90 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1.1
mM EGTA, 0.15 mM CaCl2, and 10 mM HEPES. Furthermore, 15
or 5.5 g/L PVP was added to the buffer solution to prepare an isotonic
or a hypotonic solution, respectively.

Nucleus Isolation
The nucleus was isolated from the
stage VI oocyte of a female Xenopus laevis frog (NASCO,
Fort Atkinson, WI).34 Nucleus isolation
was carried out in the isotonic buffer solution using sharp tweezers
under a stereomicroscope.34 Stage VI oocytes
were extracted from female Xenopus frogs and stored
at 18 °C in the modified Barth’s solution at pH 7.4 containing
88 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM KCl, 2.4 mM NaHCO3, 0.82 mM MgSO4, 0.33 mM Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mM CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES, and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. Fresh
oocytes were used for SECM and fluorescence experiments within 3 days
of extraction.

Preparation of Pipet-Supported ITIES Tips
Tapered micropipets
with an inner tip diameter of 0.6 ± 0.2 μm were obtained
by heat-pulling borosilicate glass capillaries (o.d./i.d. = 1.0 mm/0.58
mm, 10 cm in length, Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA) using a CO2-laser capillary puller (model P-2000, Sutter Instrument).
The rough tip end of the pulled micropipets was milled and smoothened
by the focused beam of high-energetic gallium ions (100 pA at 30 keV)
using a dual beam instrument (SMI3050SE FIB-SEM, Seiko Instruments,
Chiba, Japan).27,31 The outer and inner radii of
the milled tips were ∼0.85 and ∼0.5 μm, respectively.
The milled micropipets were dried for 2 h under vacuum (∼0.1
Torr) in a desiccator (Mini-Vacuum Desiccator, Bel-Art Products, Pequannock,
NJ) and then silanized by introducing 0.5 mL of chlorotrimethylsilane
into the desiccator.32,35 Silanization was performed in
the sealed desiccator for 40 ± 10 min depending on the temperature
and humidity of the atmosphere. After silanization, the desiccator
was purged with N2 for ∼1 min to remove extra silanization
reagent. Similarly, nanopipets were pulled from quartz capillaries
(o.d./i.d. = 1.0 mm/0.70 mm, 10 cm in length, Sutter Instrument) and
silanized in the vacuum desiccator as reported elsewhere.32 The silanized pipets with micrometer or nanometer
size were filled with 10 μL of a 1,2-DCE solution containing
0.1 M of the organic supporting electrolytes immediately before SECM
experiments.

Measurement and Analysis of SECM Approach
Curve
SECM
approach curves were measured at the NE that was smoothened and stabilized
in the recently developed microchamber.14 The chamber was filled with the mock intracellular buffer solution
of a target ion containing 5.5 g/L PVP. The nucleus was swollen in
the hypotonic solution to detach the expanding NE from the nucleoplasm.
An SECM instrument with closed-loop piezoelectric positioners (CHI
910B, CH Instruments, Austin, TX) was placed on a vibration isolation
platform (model 63-533, TMC, Peabody, MA). A two-electrode setup was
employed with a 1 mm-diameter Ag wire in a micropipet and a 1 mm-diameter
AgCl-coated Ag wire in the buffer solution. An electrochemically etched
Pt wire was used as an electrode in the nanopipet.32,33 The voltammogram of a target ion was obtained by positioning the
tip in the bulk solution prior to an approach curve measurement. All
electrochemical measurements were taken at room temperature.

An approach curve at either the NE or the Si wafer was analyzed by
employing the finite element method to determine NE permeability to
a target ion or its diffusion coefficient, respectively.14 The inner and outer tip radii employed in the
finite element analysis were consistent with those determined from
the SEM and FIB images of the tip (e.g., Figure 2B and C, respectively).

Fluorescence Transport Assay
General
procedures for
fluorescence transport assays were reported elsewhere.14,24 The nucleus was incubated in the isotonic buffer solution of the
NPC-permeabilizing ions for 20 min and then in the following transport
media for 10 min. The nucleus was rinsed with a small volume of the
isotonic solution and transferred to the microchamber filled with
the isotonic solution for fluorescence imaging using the inverted
microscope equipped with a 4× objective lens (IX-71, Olympus
America Inc., Melville, NY). BSA was labeled with trimethylrhodamine
isocyanate (Aldrich) and added to the isotonic solution for passive
transport assays. The transport medium for facilitated transport contained
0.5 μM sulforhodamine-labeled and NLS-tagged BSA (Aldrich),
0.5 μM importin α2 (Novus Biological, Littleton,
CO), 0.5 μM importin β1 (Aldrich), and energy
mix (2 mM ATP, 25 mM phosphocreatine, 30 units/mL creatine phosphokinase,
200 μM GTP). The permeabilized nucleus was also incubated in
the isotonic solution containing 1.0 g/L WGA (Aldrich) for 25 min
prior to the transport assays. In addition, impermeability to BSA
was recovered by incubating the permeabilized nucleus in the isotonic
solution without the permeabilizing ions for 1–2 h.

Results
and Discussion
Hydrophobicity of NPC-Permeabilizing Ions
PFBS– and TPhAs+ are extremely hydrophobic
as
confirmed by cyclic voltammetry of their transfer at the micropipet-supported
interface between 1,2-DCE and water. The hydrophobicity of PFBS– is high due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect
of fluorine atoms on the sulfonate group, which is weakly hydrated.36 In addition, TPhAs+ is more hydrophobic
than PFBS–, when their hydrophobicity is compared
using the TPhAs+–tetraphenylborate assumption.36 Specifically, both PFBS– and
TPhAs+ give well-defined voltammograms at potentials far
from less hydrophobic anions (ClO4– and
PF6–) and cations (FcTMA+ and
TBA+), respectively (Figure 3).
For a comparison among the different ions, the current response was
normalized against the corresponding limiting current, iT,∞, and plotted against the potential of the organic
phase with respect to the aqueous phase, E. The voltammogram
of a more hydrophobic cation is seen at the more positive potentials,
thereby yielding the order TPhAs+ > TBA+ >
FcTMA+. Inversely, the transfer of a more hydrophobic anion
is driven
at more negative potentials, which corresponds to the order PFBS– > PF6– > ClO4–.

Figure 3 Cyclic voltammograms of various ions at the
1,2-DCE/water interfaces
supported at ∼1 μm diameter pipets. Reference electrode,
Ag/AgCl. Potential sweep rate, 10 mV/s.

The extreme hydrophobicity of TPhAs+ and PFBS– was quantitatively assessed from the half-wave potentials
of the
voltammograms by using36 1  where Pi and Pj are the
partition coefficients of ions, i
and j, with the same charge, z (= +1 or −1),
respectively, between the 1,2-DCE phase and the hypotonic buffer solution,
and Ei,1/2 and Ej,1/2 are the half-wave potentials of the respective
ions as determined from the cyclic voltammograms in Figure 3. TPhAs+ is approximately 105 times more hydrophobic than FcTMA+ with a difference
of ∼300 mV between their half-wave potentials. PFBS– is approximately 103 times more hydrophobic than ClO4– with an ∼180 mV difference of half-wave
potentials. Noticeably, physiological ions in the aqueous buffer solution,
i.e., Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Cl– (see Experimental Section), are too hydrophilic to be transferred into the organic phase within
the background potential range.

Ion Permeability of the
NE
The permeability of the
NE to TPhAs+ and PFBS–, as well as to
the less hydrophobic ions, was measured by SECM using micropipet-supported
ITIES tips. The SECM measurement was carried out as reported elsewhere
for Pt tips.14 The large nucleus (∼380
μm in diameter) was isolated from a Xenopus laevis oocyte. NE permeability, kNE, was determined
from an SECM approach curve to the NE, i.e., a plot of tip current, iT, versus tip–NE distance, d. To facilitate the close tip approach, the rough and wrinkled NE
was expanded, detached from the nucleoplasm, and smoothened (Figure 2A) by swelling the nucleus in a hypotonic buffer
solution containing 5.5 g/L PVP. The swelling of the nucleus confirms
that the NPC maintained physiological macromolecular impermeability
when low concentrations of TPhAs+ and PFBS– (0.15 and 0.20 mM, respectively) were employed in the SECM study.
Additionally, we measured approach curves at the Si wafer to determine
the diffusion coefficients of the target ions in the hypotonic buffer
solution.

Figure 4A shows SECM approach
curves for TPhAs+ at the NE and the Si wafer, as obtained
using ∼0.9 μm-diameter tips. As the tip approached perpendicularly
to the substrates, the tip current decreased from the diffusion-limited
current in the bulk solution, iT,∞. The approach curve at the NE, however, was more positive than the
purely negative approach curve at the inert Si wafer (solid and dashed
lines, respectively). The higher tip current at the NE is due to TPhAs+ transport through the NPCs from the nucleus to the tip as
induced by amperometric depletion of TPhAs+ at the tip,14,24 i.e., SECM-induced transfer37 (Figure 2A). The experimental approach curve was fitted with
a theoretical curve as obtained by employing the finite element method
with NE permeability, tip inner and outer radii, and tip position
at the zero tip–NE distance as fitting parameters.14 A good fit was obtained by using a high kNE value of 0.058 cm/s and tip inner and outer
radii of 0.45 and 0.77 μm, respectively. In contrast, the experimental
approach curve at the Si wafer was fitted with a theoretical negative
approach curve, i.e., kNE = 0 cm/s, with
tip inner and outer radii of 0.47 and 0.80 μm. The tip radii
employed for the theoretical curves were confirmed by SEM and FIB
imaging. Remarkably, this analysis also shows that the smooth ∼0.9
μm-diameter tips can approach as close as 22 nm from the NE
and even closer to the Si wafer, down to a separation of 9 nm. The
short distance at the tip–NE contact indicates that the self-standing
NE is flat and stable. The nonzero contact distance is likely due
to the slight tilt of the tip with respect to the NE. Noticeably,
the small contact distance gives a minimal systematic error of ∼20%
in the permeability value.14 Specifically,
an offset distance of 22 nm at the tip–NE contact can be increased
(or decreased) by ∼20% to fit the experimental curve with theoretical
curves with <20% lower (or higher) permeability values, thereby
yielding kNE = 0.058 ± 0.012 cm/s.
This precise measurement of NE permeability was also carried out for
PF6–, ClO4–, TBA+, and FcTMA+. Both ITIES and Pt14 tips can detect FcTMA+ to obtain very similar kNE values of 0.064 and 0.059 cm/s, respectively.
This result indicates that the tips do not significantly affect NPC
permeability.

and the Si wafer as obtained with micropipet-supported ITIES tips.
Tip approach rate, 0.30 μm/s. (B) Plot of the ion permeability
of the NE against ion diffusion coefficient. The solid line is the
best fit of eq 2 with the experimental plot.

The permeability data demonstrate
that all examined ions freely
diffuse through the NPC independently of ion hydrophobicity and ionic
charge (Figure 4B). This result indicates that
ion–barrier interactions are too weak to be detected by SECM.
Nearly identical kNE values were obtained
for TPhAs+ and FcTMA+, although their hydrophobicity
differs by 5 orders of magnitude. Moreover, NE permeability to all
examined cations and anions is controlled by their diffusivity and
is proportional to their diffusion coefficients in the hypotonic solution, D. Such a linear relationship is expected when the transported
ions freely diffuse through the nanopore without significant interactions
with any component in the pore including transport barriers.14,27 We used effective medium theories to obtain the permeability of
a nanoporous membrane to freely diffusing molecules as14 2  with 3  where N is pore density, r and l are the radius and length of a
cylindrical nanopore, respectively, and σ (= πNr2) is the porosity of the membrane. The best
fit of eq 2 with the plot in Figure 4B gives the slope that is consistent with N = 40 NPCs/μm2, r = 24
nm, and l = 35 nm. These values are typical for the
NPC of the Xenopus oocyte nucleus as reported in
the literature.5,38 This nanopore density corresponds
to ∼25 NPCs under a ∼0.9 μm-diameter ITIES tip.

Attempts at Single NPC Study by Nanopipet Tips
We attempted
the preliminary study of single NPC permeability using ∼30
nm-diameter ITIES tips. Recently, we employed nanopipet-supported
ITIES tips for SECM imaging to quantitatively resolve ion transport
through the single nanopores of a silicon membrane33 as the geometrical model of the NPC.39 In such SECM measurement, a nanopipet tip must be positioned
within a few nanometers from a single nanopore. The resultant higher
mass-transport condition across the shorter nanotip–NPC gap
should enhance the kinetic effect of transport barriers on the measured
permeability of the single NPC in comparison to that of the NE at
∼20 nm distances from a submicrometer-size tip.

Our preliminary
attempts at single NPC study were limited by two rather interesting
observations. First, we found that the nucleus did not swell when
≥10 mM TPhAs+ was added to the extranuclear transport
media. The high ion concentration was employed to obtain an easily
detectable current response at ∼30 nm-diameter nanopipet tips.
No swelling of the nucleus is due to permeabilization of the NPC to
naturally impermeable macromolecules, e.g., PVP and large nuclear
proteins (see the next section for experimental confirmation), which
results in an isotonic condition across the NE. Second, ITIES-based
nanotips were fouled near the nucleus to yield much lower current
responses. It, however, is interesting that the current at the fouling
tip decreased stepwise. Figure 5 shows the
example of a current response to TBA+ at the tip that was
most severely fouled near the nucleus. The number of steps varied
with tips. In contrast, tip current was very stable when the tip was
positioned in the bulk solution. Considering the small size of the
pipet tip (∼30 nm diameter), we speculate that each step may
correspond to adsorption of one or a few protein molecules at the
nanoscale ITIES. Adsorbed protein molecules can partially block the
access of TBA+ to the interface to decrease the tip current.
In fact, even relatively small proteins with a molecular weight of
less than the passive transport limit of the NPC (<40 kDa) are
typically adsorbed at the ITIES and rarely extracted into the DCE
phase.40 Moreover, it has been reported
that adsorption of single inert nanoparticles on the micrometer-sized
electrode shows such a stepwise decrease of a current response.41,42 Nevertheless, more work is needed to verify the mechanism of nanopipet
fouling near the nucleus.

Ion-Induced Macromolecular Transport
We carried out
fluorescence transport assays to demonstrate that TPhAs+ and PFBS– permeabilize the peripheral and central
routes of the NPC to naturally impermeable macromolecules. In these
assays, rhodamine-labeled BSA (∼67 kDa) was used for passive
transport and was also tagged with NLS peptides for facilitated transport
in the presence of importin α2 (62 kDa) and importin
β1 (98 kDa). Importin α2 served
as the adaptor that binds to both importin β1 and
the NLS peptide.43 WGA was used to block
the peripheral route,21 thereby enabling
us to identify the permeabilized route.

The hydrophobic ions
permeabilize the peripheral route of the NPC to naturally impermeable
BSA.14,24 Significant fluorescence was seen from the
nucleus incubated with rhodamine-labeled BSA and 40 mM TPhAs+ or 80 mM PFBS– (left images in Figure 6A). Anomalous BSA transport was mediated through
the peripheral route and was nearly completely blocked by WGA (middle
images). This result also demonstrates that the central route was
not permeabilized to BSA by TPhAs+ or PFBS–. Noticeably, weak fluorescence was seen from the surface of the
nucleus incubated with WGA and TPhAs+. This weak fluorescence
is due to adsorption of rhodamine-labeled BSA at the NPC or the double
membrane of the NE, which confirms no nuclear import of BSA.

Figure 6 Fluorescence
microscopic images of the whole nuclei in the isotonic
solution after incubation with (A) rhodamine-labeled BSA and (B) rhodamine-labeled
and NLS-tagged BSA and importins. In part (A), the nuclei were preincubated
with either TPhAs+ or PFBS– (left) and,
then, with the isotonic solution with (middle) or without (right)
WGA. In part (B), the nuclei were preincubated only with WGA (left)
or permeabilized by TPhAs+ (middle) and then washed in
the isotonic solution (right) before incubation with WGA.

Permeabilization of the NPC to BSA is ascribed
to the cooperative
hydrophobic interactions of TPhAs+ and PFBS– with FG-based barriers through the peripheral route. The interactions
are hydrophobic because less hydrophobic cations (FcTMA+ and TBA+) and anions (ClO4– and PF6–) did not permeabilize the
NPC to BSA. Furthermore, the NPC was impermeable to BSA when the K+ concentration in the extranuclear buffer solution was increased
by 80 mM. This result excludes the possibility that permeabilization
of the NPC by the hydrophobic ions is simply due to a change in ionic
strength or due to their electrostatic interactions with the charged
regions of FG-rich nups.18 Electrostatic
effects are not crucial to permeabilization of the NPC to BSA, which
is caused by both anion (PFBS–) and cation (TPhAs+). Moreover, the hydrophobic ion–barrier interactions
are cooperative because permeabilization of the NPC to BSA requires
the threshold concentrations of the hydrophobic ions as predicted
by a recent theory (see below). The threshold concentrations are dependent
on ion hydrophobicity and are lower for more hydrophobic TPhAs+ (10 mM) than for PFBS– (80 mM).

Importantly,
the permeabilization of the peripheral route to BSA
is reversible and is not due to the substantial loss of transport
barriers from the NPC. The permeabilized NPC became impermeable to
BSA after the nucleus was washed in the solution free of the hydrophobic
ions for 1–2 h, thereby showing no fluorescence (right images
in Figure 6A). This slow recovery is due to
accumulation of the permeabilizing ions in the nucleoplasm. Complete
recovery of impermeability to BSA contrasts to the case of NPC permeabilization
by hydrophobic alcohols,44 which remove
Nup98 from the NPC.12 In addition, such
detergents as CHAPS45 and Triton X46 dissolve lipids from the double membrane to
irreversibly permeabilize the NE.

We further investigated permeabilization
of the NPC by TPhAs+ to find that this extremely hydrophobic
ion can permeabilize
the central route of the NPC to the importin complex of NLS-tagged
BSA (Figure 6B). Importin-facilitated transport
is naturally mediated through the peripheral route of the NPC and
is nearly completely blocked by WGA without TPhAs+ (left
image). In contrast, WGA did not prevent the importin-facilitated
transport of NLS-tagged BSA in the presence of 40 mM TPhAs+ (middle image), which indicates permeabilization of the central
route. Moreover, WGA did not block the importin complex of NLS-tagged
BSA after the permeabilized nucleus was incubated in the solution
containing no TPhAs+ for 4 h (right image). No recovery
of the impermeability of the central route to the importin–BSA
complex is not due to the substantial loss of central barriers. The
central route of the NPC treated with TPhAs+ is still impermeable
to passive BSA transport (middle images in Figure 6A).

Noticeably, ion-induced macromolecule transport
is unlikely to
be mediated through the double-membraned region of the NE surrounding
the NPCs. In fact, the anomalous import of BSA (∼67 kDa) into
the ion-treated nucleus was blocked by WGA (middle images in Figure 6A), which binds to the periphery of the NPC. The
much larger complex of NLS-tagged BSA with importin α and importin
β (∼230 kDa) is even more unlikely to permeate through
the hydrophobic region of the NE. On the other hand, one may argue
that a protein molecule may cross the hydrophobic region by forming
an electrically neutral and hydrophobic complex with NPC-permeabilizing
ions. This transport mechanism is analogous to the response mechanism
of a potentiometric protamine sensor based on the extraction of the
small protein (4.5 kDa) from an aqueous solution to a hydrophobic
polymer membrane.47 Recent voltammetric/amperometric
studies, however, showed that larger proteins including albumin are
rarely extracted into the hydrophobic organic media.40

Molecular Mechanisms for NPC Permeabilization
The pathway-
and mode-dependent permeabilization of the NPC by the hydrophobic
ions indicates that the central and peripheral barriers of the NPC
must be structurally different. Here, we propose the new model based
on two distinct transport barriers, i.e., polymer-brush9 and mesh10 barriers
for peripheral and central routes, respectively. Uniquely, our synergetic
model hypothesizes that polymer-brush and mesh barriers coexist in
the single NPC. In fact, it was predicted theoretically that polymer-brush
and mesh structures are not mutually exclusive and represent two stable
morphologies of the ensemble of FG repeats with different cohesiveness
and density.48 Each barrier structure,
however, has been exclusively employed in various transport models,
which hypothesize only one pathway for macromolecular transport through
the NPC. For instance, it was hypothesized that polymer-brush barriers
were formed by the FG nups tethered to the pore wall to entropically
control the macromolecular permeability of the central zone of the
NPC as the sole pathway.49 Moreover, the
selective phase/hydrogel model hypothesizes that mesh barriers homogeneously
distribute in the entire nanopore as the transport pathway.18

Coexistence of mesh and polymer-brush
barriers through central and peripheral routes, respectively, in our
synergetic model is supported by the structural studies of FG-nups.
A mesh barrier is formed through the central route by multivalent
hydrophobic interactions among the FG repeats of Nup98 (Figure 7A). Tight meshes are formed by Nup98 because cohesion
among FG repeats is facilitated in such a crowding zone50 as the pore center and also because more cohesive
GLFG (L, leucine) repeats11 are incorporated
only in Nup98 among the nups of the Xenopus oocyte
NPC. In contrast, the aqueous peripheral route is covered by FG repeats
extending from the periphery of the central FG domain, i.e., the periphery
of Nup62, Nup58, and Nup54, and also from the surface of the pore
wall, e.g., POM1217 (Figure 7B). These peripheral FG peptides are less crowding and less
interactive to each other, thereby maintaining their intrinsically
disordered structure to serve as flexible polymer brushes.

Figure 7 Mechanism of
ion-induced permeabilization of (A) central mesh barriers
and (B) peripheral polymer-brush barriers to the importin-facilitated
transport of NLS-tagged BSA and the passive transport of BSA, respectively.

We hypothesize that the NPC-permeabilizing
ions weaken the mesh
of central barriers (Figure 7A) to mediate
importin-facilitated transport. Görlich et al.51 extensively studied the hydrogels formed by FG nups to
propose that the tightest mesh is formed when all cohesive FG units
can find sufficiently close binding partners. Thus, the saturated
mesh with the minimum size is formed when the concentration of cohesive
FG repeats exceeds a critical concentration. Below this concentration,
the mesh is undersaturated and contains a significant fraction of
unpaired cohesive units, thereby yielding a larger and weaker mesh
in comparison to the saturated mesh. We speculate that the NPC-permeabilizing
ions interact with the cohesive hydrophobic units of Nup98 to cause
the transition of the saturated mesh to an unsaturated state. The
resultant larger mesh is still tight and small enough to block BSA.
The weakened mesh, however, is further enlarged through interactions
with importins to transport their complexes with NLS-tagged BSA.

Anomalous BSA transport through the peripheral route is ascribed
to ion-induced compression of peripheral polymer-brush barriers to
a lower height state (Figure 7B) as supported
by recent theoretical studies.52,53 Theoretically, such
a morphological and height change of a polymer brush can be driven
by its weak attractive interactions with multiple nanoparticles. It
was predicted that the number of the nanoparticles adsorbed to a plane-grafted
polymer-brush layer sharply increases when the nanoparticles in the
bulk exceed a certain concentration. This cooperative binding of multiple
nanoparticles collapses the polymer layer. Analogously, we speculate
that the NPC-permeabilizing ions cooperatively interact with the unpaired
cohesive FG units of polymer brushes to compress these barriers. In
fact, the resultant permeabilization of the peripheral route to BSA
requires threshold ion concentrations as expected theoretically.

Peripheral Route for Efficient Nuclear Import
Our new
synergetic model implies that the less tightened peripheral route
should be targeted for the efficient nuclear import of macromolecules
and nanomaterials for therapeutic and other applications. Flexible
polymer-brush barriers through the peripheral route are more readily
permeabilized as shown by using the extremely hydrophobic ions. Direct
addition of the hydrophobic ions to the cellular media, however, is
not optimal for safe nuclear import especially because of their irreversible
effect on central barriers, which are crucial to RNA export.54,55 Covalent modification of a large substance with these NPC-permeabilizing
ions is more practical and suitable for safer nuclear import.56

Interestingly, the implication of our
model is supported by the NLS-independent nuclear import of glycosylated
substances as explored for gene therapy and nanomedicine. Remarkably,
BSA,57 plasmid DNA,58,59 and CdTe/ZnS quantum dots with Stokes radii of up to 6.1 nm60 were glycosylated to be imported efficiently
into the nuclei of living cells. We argue that the nuclear import
of glycosylated substances is somehow mediated through the peripheral
route because it is prevented by WGA.57

Conclusions
This work exemplifies the power of ITIES-based
SECM as a quantitative
chemical tool for the in situ and real-time study of biological systems.30 The ion-selective micropipet tips enabled us
to quantitatively monitor the redox-inactive probe ions in the presence
of physiological ions and leaching nuclear proteins. The use of the
nonphysiological probe ions eventually led to biologically and therapeutically
significant discovery of the NPC-permeabilizing ions and also to experimental
observation of unique chemical interactions between the hydrophobic
ions and the transport barriers of the NPC.52,53 The fouling of a nano-ITIES tip by nuclear proteins will be avoidable
using the nucleoplasm-free NE61 in the
future SECM study of single NPCs.

Discovery of the NPC-permeabilizing
ions provided unprecedented
insights into the gating mechanism of molecular transport through
the NPCs. Our finding further supports the hypothesis that the interior
of the NPC is nanostructured into central and peripheral routes.11−14 Moreover, we proposed a new model to explain pathway- and mode-dependent
permeabilization of the NPC by the hydrophobic ions. In our model,
the NPC possesses tighter mesh barriers in the crowding central route
and more flexible polymer-brush barriers in the aqueous peripheral
route. Importantly, our synergetic model is consistent with many structural
and functional ingredients of the NPC as known experimentally and
theoretically. Moreover, our model implies that the peripheral route
should be targeted for the efficient nuclear import of macromolecular
and nanomaterial therapeutics. The efficient nuclear import of glycosylated
plasmids58,59 and nanoparticles60 has been demonstrated for gene therapy and nanomedicine, whereas
the use of the peripheral route has been unnoticed.
