Ion mobility instruments that utilize
nitrogen as buffer gas are
often preceded by an ion trap and accumulation region that also uses
nitrogen, and for different inert gases, no significant effects upon
performance are expected for ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) of larger
ions. However, we have observed significantly improved performance
for an ion funnel trap upon adding helium; the signal intensities
for higher m/z species were improved
by more than an order of magnitude compared to using pure nitrogen.
The effect of helium upon IMS resolving power was also studied by
introducing a He/N2 gas mixture into the drift cell, and
in some cases, a slight improvement was observed compared to pure
N2. The improvement in signal can be largely attributed
to faster and more efficient ion ejection into the drift tube from
the ion funnel trap.

==== Body
Ion mobility
spectrometry (IMS)
is a gas phase separation technique in which ions are distinguished
according to their collision cross sections.1 Ion packets are pulsed into a drift cell that contains a buffer
gas and pulled by a uniform weak electric field. The measured ion
arrival time is inversely proportional to the ion’s mobility
which is in turn inversely proportional to its collision cross section.2 IMS has achieved significant interest for its
potential to augment analytical applications of mass spectrometry
(MS), as well as for more fundamental applications, e.g., where collision
cross sections can be used to probe the geometry of candidate structures
by comparing the measured cross section to the calculated one for
different candidate structures. Helium is usually used as a buffer
gas due to the extensive data available and the well-developed models
that describe ion-He interaction. Since He cannot rotate or vibrate,
has no dipole, and is the least polarizable of all atoms and molecules,
it is the simplest system for which to model mobilities, making it
generally preferred for structural elucidation by IMS.

However,
nitrogen is also used widely as a buffer gas due to its
broad availability in high purity and low cost.3 In addition, other gases such as carbon dioxide and argon
have also been utilized to affect the separation power of IMS.4 To initiate an IMS experiment, ion packets are
usually generated from a pulsed source (e.g., MALDI)5 or continuous source6 (e.g.,
ESI) by chopping the ion beam using a Bradbury-Nielsen gate7 or mechanical chopper.8 To improve the IMS duty cycle and sensitivity with continuous sources,
ion accumulation and trapping have been used prior to injecting ions
into the drift cell.9 Traditionally, ion
traps that precede drift cell use the same buffer gas composition
as the drift cell, proving ease of IMS design and convenience in arranging
the ion source relative to the drift cell.

Our laboratory has
developed a sensitive IMS-MS platform that generally
utilizes nitrogen as the buffer gas.10,11 The ion source
in this instrument contains an ion funnel trap (IFT) which efficiently
traps and releases ions into the drift cell.10,12 The IFT is a stacked-ring electrode RF ion guide that confines ions
radially by applying a 180° out-of-phase RF waveform to adjacent
ring-electrodes. Axial confinement is achieved by applying appropriate
DC potentials to entrance and exit grids. The IFT is typically operated
at ∼4 Torr utilizing nitrogen gas flowing from the drift cell.
Utilizing the IFT with the IMS drift cell has been shown to provide
improved ion utilization efficiency and is a cornerstone to the overall
high sensitivity of the platform.10 In
this work, we observed that introducing helium into the IFT region
while operating the drift cell with nitrogen further improved the
sensitivity of the platform, in some cases by more than an order of
magnitude. We show in the manuscript that this improvement is attributed
to the expedited ejection of ions from the trap.

Experimental Section
The instrument utilized in the experiment consists of a home-built
ion mobility spectrometer (IMS) coupled to a commercial quadrupole
time-of-flight mass spectrometer (model 6538 QTOF, Agilent technologies,
Santa Clara, CA, USA). The layout of the IMS platform is shown in
Figure 1. Ions are formed by electrospray using
a 20 μm i.d. fused-silica emitter into a heated metal capillary
inlet (500 μm i.d., 6 cm long). The atmospheric side of the
inlet capillary is housed behind a curtain plate orifice where a curtain
gas flows in-between the inlet capillary and the curtain plate. The
curtain gas as well as the buffer gas (to the drift cell) is supplied
through flow controllers (1479A and 247D power supply/readout, MKS
Instruments, Andover MA, USA) which precisely control the flow of
each gas (He or N2). The inlet capillary as well as the
curtain gas is heated to 120 °C. Ions exiting the inlet capillary
are captured using an ion funnel trap (IFT).10,12 The design of the ion funnel trap is similar to that previously
described12 with the exception that the
electrodes are currently made using printed-circuit-boards (PCBs)
instead of brass and that the electrical components (capacitors and
resistors) are mounted on each PCB electrode while connections between
adjacent electrodes are made through miniature spring-loaded connectors.
The PCBs simplify the construction of the IFT, improve its robustness,
and significantly lower the total capacitance, and thus, less power
is needed to provide the required RF potential. Details on the IFT
are presented in the Supporting Information. The inlet capillary is offset relative to the center axis of the
ion funnel trap to minimize neutrals contamination of downstream ion
optics. Offsetting the inlet capillary also reduces gas dynamic effects
that can disturb ion trapping. The expanded ion plume is focused and
accumulated inside the ion trap for typically 1–20 ms out of
a 60 ms IMS cycle time (i.e., the time before the introduction of
the next pulse of ions). RF frequency of 1 MHz and amplitude of 150
Vp-p is applied to the IFT. Ions are typically released
from the trap by lowering the voltage on the exit grid for ∼300–500
μs. The released ion packet is radially focused in the converging
portion of the IFT and then injected into the drift cell. The drift
cell is 82 cm long and consists of drift rings of 50 mm i.d./70 mm
o.d. and spaced 5 mm apart. Similar to the IFT electrodes, the drift
rings are also made using PCB materials. In the IFT, a metalized 2
mm wide ring encompasses the inside circular edge of the electrode,
but for the drift rings, the whole ring is metalized to ensure a homogeneous
field and to minimize ground potential penetration. Following the
drift cell is a rear ion funnel that has entrance electrodes of 50
mm i.d. to capture diffused ion packets after traveling through the
drift cell; the rear ion funnel is 12 cm long, resulting in a total
effective drift tube length of 94 cm. Ions exit this rear ion funnel
through a 3 mm i.d. conductance limiting orifice and are transmitted
through two differentially pumped regions that host two quadrupoles.
A DC gradient of ∼18 V/cm is applied to the drift cell and
rear ion funnel, which is filled with N2 gas to 4 Torr.
Pressure in the drift cell is maintained slightly higher (∼50
mTorr) than the source to reduce contamination from the source region
or alteration of the drift tube gas composition. The pressure in the
interface of the ion source as well as the drift cell is measured
using capacitance manometers (627B Baratron, MKS Instruments Inc.,
Andover MA USA). Following the drift cell, the quadrupole is segmented
to allow application of a DC gradient to the segments and thus minimize
ion residence time and any contributions to mobility measurements.
Ions are then transmitted through the Agilent QTOF interface and detected.
Signal from the Agilent TOFMS detector was fed into a 1 GS/s 8-bit
AP240 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) board (Acqiris, Geneva, Switzerland)
and processed by a custom-built acquisition and control software written
in C#.

Ion trajectory simulations were performed using SIMION 8.1
(Scientific
Instrument Services Inc., Ringoes, NJ, USA). The effects of the DC
voltages, collisions with the buffer gas, and the RF on the ion trajectories
were incorporated into SIMION with a user defined code. The collisions
of ions with buffer gas at 4 Torr were simulated using the statistical
diffusion simulation (SDS) model.13 Ion–ion
interactions were considered assuming the columbic repulsion for 107 charges of 784 m/z (z = 2).

The sample used in this work was prepared
by proteolytic digestion
of bovine serum albumin (BSA; Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL,
USA) using sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and
previously described procedures.14 The
resulting solution was then diluted to 0.2 μg/μL in a
49.5:49.5:1 methanol/water/acetic acid buffer.

Results and Discussion
The detailed effects of utilizing helium (He) in various regions
of an IMS-MS platform have been examined in this work. Utilizing He
as a buffer gas can potentially have an impact on the performance
of the front and rear ion funnels, the ion accumulation and injection
trap, and the drift cell. To isolate the effects of He on the different
components of the IMS-MS platform, the ion funnel trap (IFT) was initially
turned off and ions from the source were continuously transmitted
through the ESI-MS interface, the entire IMS drift cell, and the IMS-MS
interface. This continuous ion beam allowed evaluation of He effects
on the ion funnel transmission characteristics. To study the transmission
of the ion funnel, a BSA tryptic digest sample was directly infused
into the IMS platform utilizing two buffer gas compositions in the
source IFT: (1) 100% N2/0% He and (2) 30% N2/70% He. The drift cell in these experiments was filled with 100%
N2. As shown in Figure 2, the mass
spectra at both gas compositions are virtually identical in terms
of sensitivity and m/z distribution,
indicating that He has no detectable effect on the performance of
the IFT in continuous mode. However, when the trap was enabled, there
was a dramatic effect on the mass spectra as shown in Figure 3. The results shown in Figure 3 were obtained using a trap injection time of 3.24 ms and ejection
pulse of 480 μs. The most prominent difference in the mass spectra
when He was added to N2 is higher intensity for most of
the peaks, especially higher m/z peaks (>m/z 500). The signal
improvements
for higher m/z species were generally
more than an order of magnitude. A possible reason for the observed
high intensities is the faster release of ions which otherwise were
slow to leave the trap within 480 μs. To investigate the effect
of the increased ion release speed in the presence of He, the gate
opening time (i.e., ion ejection time) was varied from 160 to 1800
μs (while keeping the trapping injection time constant at 3.24
ms) to see when all of the ions exited the trap. Shown in Figure 4a are the intensities for three peaks as a function
of exit gate opening time. The intensity of ions reached their maximum
in He within ∼800 μs. Their intensities were also observed
to be higher than in pure N2 for the same gate opening
time indicating that ions are released from the trap faster in a 70%
He/30% N2 gas mixture than in 100% N2. It should
be noted that the plateau observed in Figure 4 is not due to ADC saturation as the intensity values were below
the saturation level of the ADC. The plateau observed in Figure 4 is most likely due to better evacuation of the
ions from the trap in the case of He. Faster ejection from the trap
should depend on the mobility of ions, or in other words, ions of
low mobility should show the greatest improvement upon adding He while
those ions of high mobility should have the least improvement. As
shown in Figure 4a, the difference in sensitivity
between 70% N2/30% He and 100% N2 is on the
order of 784.38 (2+) > 831.38 (3+) > 571.86 (2+) which correlates
with mobilities of 571.86 > 831.38 > 784.38 (Figure 4b). In other words, ions of low mobility (784.38
(2+)) showed
the greatest improvement in sensitivity upon using He. The improvement
in sensitivity observed in Figure 4a ranges
from a factor of 12 to 18 for a 480 μs gate opening time. Importantly,
this improvement in sensitivity was observed for the small gate opening
times that are typically mandated in IMS measurements for optimum
resolving power. The results shown in Figure 4 are consistent with the higher mobility of ions in He than in N2. Since the mobility of ions K is defined
as1  where ze is the
ion charge, N is the number density, μ is the
reduced mass of
the ion-neutral pair, k is Boltzmann’s constant, T is temperature, and Ω is the collision cross section.
Since μ is ∼7 times smaller for the ion-He than the ion-N2 pair and Ω of peptides is ∼35% smaller in He
than in N2,15 the mobility of
ions is higher in He than in N2. However, the intensities
for 784.38 (2+) and 831.38 (3+) in 100% N2 do not reach
the intensities in the 70% He/30% N2 gas mixture even for
a long gate opening time of 1.62 ms. One reason could be a more diffuse
ion packet inside the trap in the case of N2 requiring
more than 1.6 ms to fully exit. Another reason could be some undetermined
mechanism of ion loss that is greater in N2 than in He.
Another possibility for the difference between nitrogen and helium
could be a difference in the effective trapping of ions for the different
gas compositions. The effective potential barrier confining ions in
the radial direction changes with the buffer gas conditions according
to the factor γ.16  Here, ω
is the RF frequency expressed
in angular units, ω = 2πf; the ion velocity
collisional relaxation time τ is related to the ion mobility K:  Here, m is ion mass and ze is the
charge. The ion mobility in He is ∼3.5
times higher than in N2;15 hence,
the relaxation time for He is also increased by the same factor. It
follows that the gas composition term γ is higher for He buffer
gas, compared to the pure N2 case. For pressure conditions
here, P = 4 Torr, and RF frequency f = 1.0 MHz, we obtain for He γ = 0.96 and for N2 γ = 0.65, indicating only a minor reduction of the effective
potential barrier due to the buffer gas in each case. Measurements
here were taken under conditions when the IFT was not “overfilled”,
such that a minor variation of the effective potential did not create
a measurable difference. However, the difference in γ is more
significant for increased buffer gas pressures, e.g., P > ∼10 Torr;17 thus, optimizing
RF frequency and voltage for a specific gas composition would be beneficial
at the higher pressure.

three peaks at m/z 571, 784, and

To aid in understanding the trap behavior in He and in N2, we simulated the IFT operation using SIMION 8.1. Ions of
784 (2+) m/z were trapped inside
the IFT for 2 ms
and then ejected from the trap using a gate opening time of 480 μs.
During the 2 ms trapping period, there were no losses of ions to the
trap for either buffer gas composition, indicating similar trapping
efficiencies. However, as the ions exit the trap in both gases, some
ions were lost to the electrodes immediately following the exit gate
(the converging section) while some ions did not exit the trap (i.e.,
were retained) as shown in Figure 5. In N2 buffer gas, 44% of ions are retained in the trap without
being ejected, while no ions were retained using the He buffer gas
indicating better ejection efficiency for the He. Losses for N2 gas were much greater with only 33% of ions transmitted while
77% were transmitted in He with losses of 23% for both N2 and He in the converging section. This is in line with the experimental
observations (Figure 4) and further illustrates
why He-enriched buffer gas improves signal intensity. Ion simulations
further supported that the performance of the IFT is improved in the
He-enriched buffer gas relative to pure N2 and that most
of the improvement comes from faster ion ejection. The ion simulations
also provide insight into further improving the performance of the
IFT by minimizing ion losses in the converging region. During trapping,
the ion cloud expands and ions are trapped in regions close to the
ring electrodes of the trap. The exit gate DC potential pushes the
ions closer to the IFT ring electrodes due to the DC field penetration
and upon release from the trap, and these ions are not immediately
refocused to the center. Therefore, they are more prone to be lost
to the electrodes (as revealed from simulations) in the converging
section of the IFT that immediately follows the exit gate. One possible
modification to address ion losses at the converging section would
be to keep the inner diameter constant for the first few electrodes
following the trapping section before forming a converging shape.
This would allow the ions to refocus to the center prior to entering
the converging section of the funnel. Indeed, SIMION simulations indicate
that only 1% of ions are lost in such an IFT design utilizing N2 as compared to 23% in the current design (Figure 5). Experimental verification of this change to the
IFT design is planned.

compositions.
Black: 100% N2; red: 100% He.

The introduction of He into the trapping region of the IFT
can
also lead to leakage of He into the drift cell. This leakage causes
ion arrival times to shift to shorter values based upon helium composition
which may result in reduced IMS resolving power in the present IMS-MS
design since R = t/Δt, where t is arrival time and Δt is the peak width at full width half-maximum. To explicitly
investigate the He effect on the IMS resolving power, we introduced
the same He/N2 gas mixture into both the ion source and
drift cell by splitting the gas mixture supply line (Figure 1), making the gas composition in the source identical
to that in the drift cell. As expected, as the He composition increased,
the arrival time decreased linearly. In some cases, the calculated
IMS resolving power (Figure 6) slightly improved
upon adding He, but in others, the resolving power did not change.
Thus, benefits of He as a buffer gas in both the trap and drift cell
were observed since it did not degrade the IMS resolving power, allowed
a somewhat increased duty cycle, and resulted in greatly improved
signal intensities with the present design.

power for several ions from ESI of a BSA
tryptic digest as a function of nitrogen percentage in a N2/He buffer gas mixture. Several ions have two conformers and they
are reported separately. Trap injection time was maintained at 3.24
ms while the gate opening time was 480 μs.

Conclusions
We have observed that utilizing helium in the
ion funnel trap during
ion ejection improves the sensitivity of our IMS-MS platform by more
than an order of magnitude for lower mobility ions. The improvement
in sensitivity is attributed primarily to the faster ejection of ions
from the ion funnel trap, which was confirmed by ion simulations using
SIMION. To a much lesser degree, the improvements in sensitivity can
be attributed to better ion confinement in He relative to nitrogen.
The ion ejection from the trap can be improved by lowering the pressure
in the trap. Thus, the effects observed in this work may not be as
dramatic for traps that operate at lower pressure. The IMS platform
used in this work utilizes a trap that works at a similar pressure
as the drift cell. This arrangement maximizes the sensitivity by drastically
minimizing ion losses at the interface between the trap and the drift
cell, as well as minimizing ion activation during transport to the
drift cell. However, traps that operate at lower pressure (mTorr)
are often coupled to drift cells operating at higher pressures (e.g.,
a few torr). The large pressure difference (more than an order of
magnitude) between the trap and the drift cell creates a significant
challenge for injecting ions. Conformational change as well as ion
activation has been attributed to higher injection voltages.18 In addition, in the absence of effective ion
confinement at the trap/drift cell interface, ion losses are inevitable.
Ion activation in IMS platforms that utilized this large pressure
difference between the trap and the drift cell has been reduced but
not eliminated, by inclusion of a helium rich region between the trap
and the drift cell. In contrast, the IMS platform described here utilizes
a much smoother and gradual change in pressure between the trap and
the drift cell (∼50 mTorr) resulting in maximum ion transmission
and minimal ion activation in nitrogen as well as in helium. Although
a goal of this work was to evaluate possible improvements in sensitivity
of IMS-MS measurements, a specific instrument platform was used that
incorporated only a one source ion funnel. Since ESI in an environment
that is highly rich in He can be problematic due to electrical breakdown
phenomena, utilizing a dual funnel interface17 is advantageous for allowing independent control over the gas composition
of the ESI interface and IFT-drift tube regions. Finally, the present
work suggests modifications that should result in further improvements
to IMS-MS performance.
