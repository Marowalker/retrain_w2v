Short
peptide loops selected from phage libraries can specifically
recognize the formation of hapten-antibody immunocomplexes and can
thus be used to develop phage anti-immunocomplex assays (PHAIA) for
noncompetitive detection of small molecules. In this study, we generated
recombinant chimeras by fusing anti-immunocomplex peptides selected
from phage libraries to the N- or C-termini of core streptavidin and
used them to setup phage-free noncompetitive assays for the herbicide
clomazone (MW 240 Da). The best conditions for refolding were optimized
by a high throughput screening allowing to obtain tens of mg of purified
protein per liter of culture. The noncompetitive assay developed with
these chimeras performed with a 50% saturating concentration (SC50) of 2.2 ± 0.3 ng/mL and limit of detection (LOD) of
0.48 ng/mL. Values that are 13- and 8-fold better that those obtained
for the SC50 and LOD of the competitive assay setup with
the same antibody. Apart from the first demonstration that recombinant
peptide-streptavidin chimeras can be used for sensitive immunodetection
of small molecules with a positive readout, this new assay component
is a highly standardized reagent with a defined stoichiometry, which
can be used in combination with the broad option of existing biotinylated
reagents offering a great versatility for the development of conventional
immunoassay and biosensors. The utility of the test was demonstrated
analyzing the clomazone runoff during the rice growing season in northern
Uruguay.

==== Body
While macromolecular
analytes
are relevant targets in clinical diagnosis, small-molecules constitute
the vast majority of the analytes of interest in environmental studies,
toxicology, drug monitoring, biosecurity, etc. The classical two-antibody
sandwich assay used for immunodetection of macromolecules cannot be
applied to small-analytes, because of their small size that impedes
the simultaneous binding of two antibodies. With few exceptions, such
as the use of poly dentate ligands,1 antimetatype
antibodies,2 or the open sandwich assay,3 the immunodetection of these analytes has been
restricted to the use of competitive assays which use a competitor
hapten either labeled with a tracer molecule or conjugated to a carrier
protein for coating. Unfortunately, this competitive assay performs
with inferior sensitivity, precision and kinetics range than the two-site
noncompetitive format,4 and their adaptation
into lateral-flow tests or biosensors is more difficult. In 2007,
we introduced the use of small peptide loops that, upon binding of
the hapten, specifically recognize the modifications of the antigen-binding
site on the antibody, and therefore can be used to detect the formation
of the immunocomplex (IC). These peptide loops are selected on the
immobilized IC, from phage display libraries expressing 7–11
random residue peptides flanked by two cysteines that form a disulfide
bridge and constrain the peptide structure. The initial application
of these anti-IC peptides for noncompetitive detection of small molecules
was first described for the herbicides molinate and atrazine, and
the drugs digoxin and cyclosporine,5 and
later for the flame-retardant brominated diphenyl ether6 and the pyrethroid metabolite phenoxybenzoic
acid.7 In this method, termed PHAIA (phage
anti-immunocomplex assay), the IC was detected by the formation of
a tertiary complex with the phage particle, which was subsequently
revealed with an anti-M13 peroxidase conjugate, or by amplification
of the phage DNA by real time PCR.7 In
addition to a proportional signal, PHAIA also provides an increased
sensitivity. Typically, using the same monoclonal antibody, the adaptation
of any competitive assay into PHAIA is accompanied by a 10–20
fold increase in sensitivity, and this can be even higher in the case
of polyclonal antibodies.8 Additionally,
the formation of the antibody-analyte-peptide complex provides a double
recognition of the analyte, which also contributes to a higher assay
specificity.9 The phage particles are particularly
robust and when the peptide is fused to the major phage coat protein,
their filamentous nature provides a multivalent scaffold that allows
the display of hundred copies of the peptide providing high avidity
for the IC.10 However, the phage particles
are “unconventional” reagents for the immunoassay industry,
and they can confer antibiotic resistance to Escherichia coli laboratory strains, which can be a safety concern in molecular biology
laboratories. To work-around these limitations, we recently demonstrated
that the phage particles can be substituted by commercial conjugates
of streptavidin or avidin loaded with synthetic anti-IC peptides that
contain a biotinylated lysine in their N-terminus.11 These complexes, that we termed nanopeptamers, could be
used to develop two-site noncompetitive assays for small molecules,
which performed with similar sensitivity and specificity than their
parent anti-IC phage particles.

In this work, we present a further
development of the streptavidin
nanopeptamer technology optimizing their production as recombinant
peptide-streptavidin chimeras. This not only dramatically reduces
the production costs, but it also frees the biotin binding sites allowing
the use of the full arrange of biotinylated reagents, including tracer
enzymes, fluorophores, colloidal gold, magnetic beads, etc. which
will facilitate the development of all sort of immunoassays, incluiding
optical, electrochemical and magnetic biosensors. Streptavidin (STR)
is a homotetrameric protein naturally secreted by the actinobacterium Streptomyces avidinii, which has an exceptionally high affinity
(Kd of 10–13–10–16 M) for biotin.12 The
monomers are synthesized as full-length proteins of 159 amino acid
that are further processed to remove 12 and 20 amino acids from the
N- and C-termini, respectively, yielding core streptavidin. There
is one biotin binding site per monomer, but the binding of biotin
by an isolated monomer has a Kd of 10–7 M, and only after assembling of the tetramer the
affinity becomes dramatically higher.13 The protein has been expressed in E. coli either
as a fusion protein or alone at good yields, though normally as an
insoluble protein.14−17 As a model small analyte to develop the recombinant nanopeptamers
we choose the herbicide clomazone (2-[(2-chlorophenyl)methyl]-4,4-dimethyl-3-isoxazolidinone,
MW 240 Da), one of the main herbicides used in rice culture, and the
peptide CLEAPNIEGC which is specific for the IC formed by the herbicide
and the monoclonal antibody MAb5.6.9 After
assay optimization, the recombinant nanopeptamer was used to study
the runoff of the herbicide during the rice growing season in Uruguay.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
Monoclonal antibody 5.6 (MAb5.6), a mouse
IgG against clomazone, was prepared as described before (Rossotti
2010). Clomazone was purchased from Riedel-de Haën, Seelze,
Germany. The BCA Protein Assay Kit for the quantification of purified
antibody and protein G affinity columns for IgG purification, were
purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL). BSA, Tween 20, IPTG (isopropyl
β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside), polyethylene glycol 8000
(PEG), and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), other
common chemicals were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).

Assembling
of the Anticlomazone IC Nanopeptamer Construct
The STR gene
(amino acids 14–139) was optimized for expression
in E. coli and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies
(IDT, Coralville, IA, USA). To assemble the anticlomazone IC cassettes,
the streptavidin-gene template was amplified by PCR employing the
primers shown in Figure 1. The primers Fw-1
in combination with Rv-1, and Fw-2 with Rv-2 were used to amplify
the nanopeptamer genes with the peptide CLEAPNIEGC (pICX11) at the
N-terminus (pICX11-STR), or C-terminus (STR-pICX11), respectively.
The cassettes carried two noncomplementary SfiI sites that were used
to clone them into a modified pET28a+ vector (Novagen), between the
OmpA signal peptide and the 6 x His and HA (hemagglutinin) tags. The
ligated vectors were electroporated in competent BL21(DE3) E. coli cells (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Figure 1 Primers used
to assemble the anticlomazone IC cassettes. The regions
coding for the peptide, spacers (Sp), and the annealing to the streptavidin
gene are denoted on top of the nucleotide sequence. The SfiI sites
further used for cloning are underlined.

Expression and Partial Purification of the Recombinant STR Nanopeptamers
Selected colonies of BL21(DE3) transformed with either the pICX11-STR
or STR-pICX11 constructions, whose sequence were verified by DNA sequencing,
were grown in 500 mL of LB ampicillin (50 μg/mL) at 37 °C,
with shaking at 250 rpm, to an absorbance of 0.4 AU at 600 nm. The
cultures were then induced with 1 mM IPTG, incubated for 3 h and centrifuged
at 5000 g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cells were sonicated in PBS
(phosphate buffer saline) on ice and the inclusion bodies were purified
by a detergent-washing protocol as described.18 The recombinant chimeras were dissolved in 10 mL of buffer 100 mM
Tris-phosphate, 8 M urea, pH 9, by overnight rocking at 4 °C,
the solution was clarified by centrifugation at 30 000g for 30 min, and the concentrations of the chimeras was
estimated by densitometry from SDS-PAGE gels.

Protein Refolding Screening
A series of buffers covering
a wide pH range were prepared: 200 mM acetate, pH 5.0; 100 mM phosphate,
pH 6.0; 100 mM phosphate, pH 7.0; 200 mM Tris, pH 8.0; 200 mM Tris,
pH 8.5; 200 mM Tris, pH 9.0; and 200 mM carbonate, pH 11. One hundred
microliters of these buffers were dispensed into the wells of a 96-well
microtiter plate and were combined with 100 μL of the following
additives to create a large arrange of refolding solutions: arginine
(2.0 M, 1.0 M, 0.4 M), sucrose (3.0 M, 1.0 M, 0.4 M), glycerol (80%,
26%, 8%), and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 (40%, 20%, 10%). Ten
microliters of the urea solubilized chimeras were added into each
well, mixed thoroughly and kept a 4 °C for 1 h.

Activity of
the Refolded Chimeras
The biotin-binding
activity of the refolded proteins was tested by ELISA. Polystyrene
high-binding microtiter plates (Greiner, Germany) were coated with
100 μL/well of 0.3 μg/mL of biotinylated bovine serum
albumin (BSA) in PBS, incubated overnight at 4 °C, blocked by
incubation with 5% skimmed milk in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) for
1 h, and washed with PBS-T. The plates were then loaded with 95 microliters
of 1% BSA in PBS-T and 5 μL of each of the refolding solutions
(about 150 ng of refolded protein), incubated for 1 h and washed.
One hundred microliters of biotin conjugated to peroxidase (Pierce,
Rockford, IL, USA) diluted 1:2000 in BSA 1%, after 40 min. After thorough
washing, 100 μL of the peroxidase substrate (0.4 mL of 6 mg/mL
3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine in DMSO, 0.1 mL of 1%
H2O2, in 25 mL of 0.1 M citrate acetate buffer,
pH 5.5) were dispensed into each well, and the reaction was stopped
after 10 min by addition of 50 μL of 2 N H2SO4. Absorbance was read at 450/650 nm in a microtiter plate
reader (Multiskan MS, Thermo Labsystems, Waltham, MA). Similarly,
the anti-IC specificity of the refolded nanopeptamers was also assessed
by ELISA. Plates were coated with 5 μg/mL of MAb5.6 (100 μL/well),
blocked, washed, and dispensed with 5 μL of the refolded proteins
diluted in PBS-T with or without clomazone (100 ng/mL), after incubation
(1 h), the wells were washed and dispensed with an anti-HA antibody
coupled to peroxidase (HRP) (Roche, Madison, WI) or alternatively
with biotin-HRP (Pierce).

Nanopeptamer ELISA for Clomazone
Optimal concentrations
of the coating antibody and detecting nanopeptamer were established
by checkerboard titrations. Briefly, a microtiter plate was coated
with 100 μL/well of MAb5.6 in PBS), at concentrations of 10,
5, 2.5, and 0.5 μg/mL that were dispensed in rows A and B, C
and D, E and F, and H and I, respectively. After blocking, every other
row was dispensed with 50 μL of serial dilutions of the refolded
protein in PBS-T, plus 50 μL of PBS-T containing 100 or 0 ng/mL
of clomazone, respectively. After they were incubated for 1 h and
washed, the binding of the nanopeptamers was revealed using a 1/2000
dilution of the biotinylated HRP conjugate. After they were washed,
the plates were incubated with substrate and read as described before.
On the basis of the checkerboard titration, appropriate dilutions
of coating antibody MAb5.6 and refolded protein were selected, to
obtain a maximum difference between the absorbance obtained in the
presence and absence of clomazone. The ELISA test was then essentially
performed as described above. A 12-point internal standard curve (0–1000
ng/mL range) was performed by triplicates in each experiment. Absolute
or normalized values were fitted to a four-parameter logistic equation
using Genesis Lite 3.03 (Life Sciences, London) package software.
For the analysis of field samples, the reaction mix was supplemented
with 10% of Interference Buffer (1 M Tris, 0.3 M NaCl, 0.3 M EDTA,
1% BSA, pH 7.4).

Metal Affinity Chromatography
The
nanopeptamers were
purified from the refolded extracts by immobilized metal ion affinity
chromatography employing a Ni-NTA column (HisTrap HP 1 mL, GE Health
Care, Pittsburgh, USA) equilibrated with buffer 50 mM Tris, 0.3 M
NaCl, 20 mM imidazol, pH 7. After the sample was injected, the column
was washed with 5 column volumes of 50 mM Tris, 0.3 M NaCl, 40 mM
imidazol, pH 7, and the protein eluted (1 mL fractions) by increasing
the concentration of imidazole to 500 mM. After dialysis against PBS,
the recombinant nanopeptamers were supplemented with Complete Protease
Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and sodium
azide 0.05%. The preparation was filtered (0.22 μm) and stored
in aliquots at 4 °C for short-term use or kept at −80
°C until used.

Results and Discussion
Cloning and Expression
of the Recombinant STR Nanopeptamers
We have recently showed
that the Shiga like toxin (VTX) can be
used as scaffold for the production of recombinant VTX nanopeptamers.19 However, they need to be conjugated to a tracer
enzyme limiting the scope of their applications. The use of core streptavidin
as scaffold for the display of recombinant anti-immunocomplex peptides
will remove these limitations, because they can be combined with the
broad options of biotinylated reagents that could serve as assay tracers.
To produce recombinant STR nanopeptamers specific for clomazone we
fused the peptide pICX11 (CLEAPNIEGC) to the N-terminus (pICX11-STR),
or C-terminus (STR-pICX11), of a synthetic core streptavidin gene
using the spacers shown in Figure 2. The coding
sequences for these constructs were assembled by PCR using the primers
described above, and were cloned into a modified pET28 vector (Novagen)
between two noncomplementary SfiI sites, flanked by the nucleotide
sequences of the OmpA signal peptide and the C-terminal 6× His
and HA tags. Initial experiments of expression in E. coli BL21 showed that the streptavidin chimeras were only found in the
insoluble fraction, which could not be reverted by modification of
the temperature, IPTG concentration, or induction time of the cultures.
Consequently, inclusion bodies were solubilized in buffer 100 mM Tris-phosphate,
8 M urea, pH 9.

Renaturation of Solubilized Chimeras
A large screening
of refolding conditions was performed in microtiter plates as described
above. Initially, the renatured proteins were tested for their binding
to biotin using a sandwich ELISA, which showed that, with few exceptions,
good activity was recovered in almost all tested conditions (Supporting Information, Figure S-1). Additional
selection of the active proteins was performed on the basis of the
specific recognition of the clomazone-MAb5.6 IC by the chimeras, using
the HA tag for detection, Figure 3.

absence (gray) of clomazone. Binding of the nanopeptamers was revealed
with the anti-HA HRP conjugate using TMB as substrate. The concentration
of the refolding agent is shown on top of the pH brackets. (A) Nanopeptamer
pICX11-STR and (B) Nanopeptamer STR-pICX11.

There was a marked difference between the N- and C-terminal
chimeras.
In general, all refolded pICX11-STR proteins reacted strongly and
specifically with the IC, with little residual reactivity against
the uncombined antibody. The difference in the readouts in the presence
or absence of clomazone was even higher when the nanopeptamer was
detected with the biotin-HRP conjugate (Supporting
Information, Figure S-2). The strongest signals, and probably
most efficient refolding, were found with the sucrose and glycerol
buffers. In general, the C-terminal expression of the peptide gave
place to a high background. This was unexpected because in our recent
work describing the use of synthetic nanopeptamers, the peptides were
tethered to the streptavidin tetramer through their N-terminus, and
yet the reactivity with the uncombined antibody was negligible. The
difference may arrive from the fact that in the recombinant chimera
the peptide is fused to the 6 × His and HA tags, but this issue
was not further studied and the STR-pICX11 nanopeptamer was not further
used. The performance of the most promising refolded pICX11-STR chimeras
(minimal residual reactivity with the unbound antibody) was further
studied by checkerboard titration (coating concentration of antibody
versus concentration of nanopeptamer) using a fixed amount of analyte.
In the development of competitive methods using phage (PHAIA) or synthetic
nanopeptamers for detection, we found that the best sensitivity is
obtained with the highest concentration of coating antibodies and
detecting reagent, providing that they do not compromise the background
of the assay.5,11 In this case, the recombinant
pICX11 refolded in 100 mM phosphate, 1.5 M sucrose, pH 7.0 showed
the best signal to background ratio over a long-range of concentrations
(Supporting Information, Figure S-3) and
this chimera was therefore selected for the development of the noncompetitive
assay.

12% SDS-gel stained with coomassie blue. Lanes 1–3, fractions
1–3 eluted from the Ni-NTA column. These samples were mixed
with sample buffer but were not heated before running. Lane 4, same
as lane 1, but heated at 95 °C for 10 min which is necessary
for the dissociation of the tetrameric structure of streptavidin.

Nanopeptamer Assay for
Clomazone
The pICX11 nanopeptamer
was purified on Ni-NTA agarose and the formation of the tetramer was
analyzed in SDS-gels, Figure 4. Under mild
denaturing conditions (SDS at room temperature) streptavidin does
not dissociate, and this was also the case for the nanopeptamer that
occurred as a ∼68 kDa band (lanes 1–3), which is in
agreement with the theoretical size of 69 752 Da of the tetramer.
After it was heated at 95 °C, the oligomeric structure of the
complex dissociated and the monomer appeared as a band of ∼18
kDa. The assay concentration of the purified nanopeptamer pICX11-STR
was then optimized by checkerboard titrations and used to develop
a noncompetitive test for clomazone, Figure 5. The midpoint of the titration curve, corresponding to the concentration
of analyte giving 50% of signal saturation (SC50) was 2.2
± 0.3, and the limit of detection (LOD = analyte concentration
giving a 10% increase over the zero signal) was 0.48 ng/mL. These
parameters are essentially the same that were obtained with the nanopeptamers
prepared with streptavidin-HRP functionalized with biotinylated peptides,11 showing that the variations in the attachment
point to the streptavidin oligomer (Figure 1) do not have a major effect in the overall avidity of the complex
for the IC. When these values are compared to the performance of the
competitive assay set up with the same antibody, SC50 =
28 ± 1.1 ng/mL and LOD = 4.0 ng/mL, it becomes evident that the
recombinant nanopeptamer assay performs with increased sensitivity,
representing an improvement of about 13 and 8 fold, respectively.

Streptavidin Nanopeptamer Analysis of Clomazone Runoff from
Rice Cultivars
To study the potential utility of the test
for the analysis of the runoff of pesticides from rice fields, we
spiked water samples collected from areas with no record of clomazone
application. Three water samples were spiked with various concentrations
of the herbicide. To avoid the matrix effect caused by humic acids
and other interfering compounds, the interference buffer was included,
containing a bulk protein, a chelating agent to sequester metal ions,
and high salt content to increase the ionic strength. The recoveries
were good, even in the low concentration range, Table 1.

Figure 5 pICX11-STR noncompetitive ELISA for clomazone. The assay was carried
out on wells coated with 2 μg of MAb5.6 and using 1.5 μg/well
of the purified pICX11-STR nanopeptamer. Biotin-HRP was used for detection.
The SC50 was 2.2 ± 0.3 ng/mL. Measurements were performed
in triplicate; error bars correspond to the standard deviations.

The assay was then
used to study the occurrence of clomazone in
the basin of the Tala creek, a tributary stream of the Arapei river,
in Salto, Uruguay. The Tala creek crosses a rice growing area, as
well as soybean, sorguhm, and raygrass fields. Clomazone is used exclusively
in the rice area, being first applied in spring about 1 week before
planting (0.86 kg/ha) and then about 15–20 days postemergence
(0.38 kg/ha). After this second application, the fields were flooded
and remained so for 50 days. The impact of the clomazone runoff was
studied in seven sampling points along this basin, point 1 was upstream
of the rice fields, points 2–4 and 6 were close to the fields,
and point 5 and 7 were downstream of the planting area, as shown in
Figure 6. Samples were taken regularly over
a 55 day period (two contiguous (1 m) samples per point), and analyzed
by triplicates using the nanopeptamer assay, Table 2. Overall, the concentration of the herbicide was very low,
and below the LOD in most cases. Samples collected from sampling points
3, 4, 5, and 7 had measurable concentration of the herbicides at the
end of the study, probably in connection with some heavy rain episodes.
However, all of these samples but one had values that were below the
recommended limit or 3 ng/mL for environmental surface water.20

Conclusions
The
substitution of synthetic nanopeptamers by recombinant peptide-streptavidin
chimeras represents a significant step forward in the use of nanopeptamers
for small analytes. On the one hand, there is a substantial reduction
in cost, particularly because the chimeras avoid the use of expensive
synthetic peptides, at the same time that can be robustly produced
at high yields. Typically, after refolding and purification, about
10 mg/L of the recombinant nanopeptamer are obtained in shake flask
cultures, being enough for about 500 × 96 well plate assays.
Furthermore, the recombinant nanopeptamers leave the biotin-binding
sites free, which are thus available to be used in combination with
the broad variety of biotinylated reagents, including tracer enzymes,
fluorophores, magnetic beads, etc., making them highly versatile reagents.
As demonstrated here these chimeras can be developed into simple,
cost-effective, and robust noncompetitive assays for environmental,
food safety, or medical applications.
