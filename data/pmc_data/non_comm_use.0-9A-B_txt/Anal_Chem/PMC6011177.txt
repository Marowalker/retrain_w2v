Folate
cofactors play a key role in one-carbon metabolism. Analysis
of individual folate species is hampered by the low chemical stability
and high interconvertibility of folates, which can lead to severe
experimental bias. Here, we present a complete workflow that employs
simultaneous extraction and stabilization of folates by derivatization.
We perform reductive methylation employing stable isotope labeled
reagents to retain information on the position and redox state of
one-carbon units as well as the redox state of the pteridine ring.
The derivatives are analyzed by a targeted LC(HILIC)-MS/MS method
without the need for deconjugation, thereby also preserving the glutamation
state of folates. The presented method does not only improve analyte
coverage and sensitivity as compared to other published methods, it
also greatly simplifies sample handling and storage. Finally, we report
differences in the response of bacterial and mammalian systems to
pharmacological inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase.

==== Body
One-carbon
(C1) metabolism is
a central metabolic pathway which distributes C1 units derived from
C1 donors to several crucial cellular pathways, namely, purine synthesis,1 thymidine synthesis,2 and the S-adenosyl methionine cycle.3 Alterations in C1 metabolism have been reported in numerous diseases,
including neural tube defects,4 cardiovascular
disease,5 and cancer.6 In mammals, potential C1 donors include the nonessential
amino acids serine and glycine, the essential amino acids histidine
and tryptophan, as well as the degradation products of choline, betaine,
dimethylglycine, and sarcosine. Folates are essential cofactors of
C1 metabolism. They act as carriers which can temporarily bind C1
groups in different oxidation states. Folate species are thought to
exist in large part as a stabilized, protein bound form in cells,7 and some are unstable in solution.8 However, quantifying intracellular folate pools
requires quenching of enzymatic activity and extraction of folates
from their native protein environment, which can result in a loss
of analytes. Several LC-MS methods have been published attempting
to quantify folate pools individually, most of them focusing on the
more stable isoforms or employing isotope dilution approaches to account
for losses during sample preparation and analysis9−11 (also see Supporting Information Table S1). Unfortunately,
the isotope dilution approach suffers from the limited availability
of isotopically labeled standards as well as a loss of sensitivity
for less stable folates which undergo interconversion or degradation.
Recently, Chen et al.12 employed sodium
cyanoborodeuteride to reduce 5,10-methylene THF to isotopically labeled
5-methyl THF, thereby preventing spontaneous decomposition of 5,10-methylene
THF to THF and formaldehyde. Using enzymatic deconjugation of polyglutamtes
and combined with a second workflow, which includes a heat inactivation
step to halt residual enzymatic activity, they were able to quantify
five pools of one-carbon-carrying folates. However, the requirement
of two extracts for the two separate workflows and residual pH dependent
interconversion of 5-formyl THF to 10-formyl THF via 5,10-methenyl
THF (Figure 1A) are
potential problems of this method.

In this study, we show
how all naturally occurring folate species
can be stabilized by specific derivatization of folates directly in
the quenching solution and how the information on the oxidation state
of both, the folate ring and C1 unit, can be encoded as isotopologue
derivatives. The stable derivatives can be readily analyzed by LC-MS
with the added benefit of improved sensitivity compared to nonderivatized
folates. Moreover, the derivatization chemistry is compatible with
metabolites up- and downstream of C1 metabolism, allowing a complete
depiction of C1 metabolism in a single analysis.

Experimental Section
Derivatization
of Folate Standards
Standards of 5-methyl
THF, 5,10-methylene THF, 5,10-methenyl THF, THF, DHF, folic acid,
and 5-formyl THF were purchased from Schircks Laboratories, Bauma,
Switzerland. 10-Formyl THF was synthesized from 5-formyl THF as published
by Stover et al.13

Folate standards
were dissolved in ice cold 80% methanol, containing 30 mM NaCNBD3, 0.2% formaldehyde-13C, d2 (∼67 mM), and
0.1% acetic acid at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Samples were incubated
for 60 min on ice and stored at −20 °C until measured.

Cultivation of E. coli K12
A total
of 50 mL of LB-Miller medium was inoculated from an overnight culture
of E. coli K12 to an OD600 of 0.1 and grown at 37
°C in a 500 mL flask, shaking at 300 rpm. OD was measured at
0, 60, and 90 min and immediately before harvesting. After reaching
an OD of 0.4, 10 μM (0.15 mL of a 1 mg/mL stock solution in
methanol) trimethoprim was added to the treatment group (5 biological
replicates), and the same volume of methanol was added to the control
group (5 biological replicates). Thirty minutes after adding Trimethoprim,
OD600 was measured (mean OD600 0.71 for control group and 0.63 for
treated group), and cells were centrifuged at 4500g for 3 min. The supernatant was removed, and cells were immediately
resuspended in 0.5 mL of ice cold 80% methanol, containing 30 mM NaCNBD3, 0.2% formaldehyde-13C, d2, and 0.1% acetic acid
by pipetting. Samples were incubated on ice for 60 min, transferred
to microcentrifuge tubes, and centrifuged at 16 000g for 1 min. Supernatants were transferred to a new tube,
and the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 mL of ice cold 80% methanol
and 0.1% acetic acid and incubated in a sonic bath for 15 min. After
sonication, the suspension was centrifuged at 16,000 g for 3 min and
the supernatant was combined with the previous supernatant. An aliquot
of 50 μL was subjected to analysis (pre-concentrated sample).
The remaining 950 μL was dried in a rotary evaporator and resuspended
by sonication in 50 μL of 80% methanol and 0.1% acetic acid
for 15 min. Samples were centrifuged at 16 000g for 3 min, and the supernatant was analyzed (post concentrated sample).

Cultivation of Mammalian Cells
HepG2 cells were acquired
from ATCC (ATCC HB-8065) and grown in T75 flasks in RPMI1640 (Gibco,
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Switzerland) containing 2 mM glutamine,
2 g/L glucose, and 10% FBS. One milligram of methotrexate hydrate
(Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs SG, Switzerland) was dissolved in 10 μL
of 1 M sodium hydroxide and diluted with phosphate buffered saline
to 1 mL and sterile filtered (2.2 mM Stock solution). At 80% cell
confluence, 20 μM methotrexate was added to the treatment group
(180 μL stock solution per 20 mL medium, three biological replicates).
A total of 180 μL of phosphate buffered saline containing 1%
(v/v) 1 M sodium hydroxide was added to the control group. Sixteen
hours post treatment, cells were harvested by trypsinization and centrifuged
at 4 °C and 400g for 5 min. The supernatant
was removed; the cell pellet was briefly washed with 1 mL of PBS and
then resuspended in 0.5 mL of ice cold 80% methanol, containing 30
mM NaCNBD3, 0.2% formaldehyde-13C, d2, and 0.1%
acetic acid by pipetting. Subsequent steps were carried out as described
for E. coli.

LC-MS/MS Method
On the basis of the highly hydrophilic
character of both polyglutamated folates and the derivatives, either
ion pairing chromatography or hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography
(HILIC) are potential methods for separation of folylpolyglutamates
before MS analysis. Since superior sensitivity of folate anaylsis
in positive mode was reported before,14 we tested two HILIC phases, namely, the aminopropyl modified silica
employed by Lu et al.15 (Luna-NH2, Phenomenex)
and a polymer-based zwitterionic stationary phase (ZIC-pHILIC, Merck).
The latter was chosen because of the lower noise levels and accompanying
better signal-to-noise ratios achieved. As a total of 72 folate species
plus several up- and downstream metabolites were measured, a scheduled
MRM method was used. Liquid chromatography was carried out on an Agilent
Technologies Infinity 1290 UHPLC system. The column was a SeQuant
ZIC-pHILIC 150 × 2.1 mm plus guard column 20 × 2.1 mm (Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany). The solvents were acetonitrile without any further
additives (solvent A) and 20 mM (NH4)2CO3 in H2O, adjusted to pH = 9.2 with ammonium hydroxide
solution (solvent B). The following gradient was run at a constant
flow rate of 100 μL/min: 0 min, 30% B; 2 min, 30% B; 18 min,
70% B; 20 min, 95% B; 23 min, 95% B; followed by re-equilibration
at 30% B for 7 min. The column compartment temperature was 30 °C.
Mass spectrometry was performed on an ABSciex 5500 QTrap mass spectrometer
in positive, scheduled MRM mode. The detection window was set to 60
s, and the target scan time was 1.5 s. Source parameters were curtain
gas, 20 psi; collision gas, medium; ion spray voltage, 5500 V; temperature,
700 °C; ion source gas 1, 40 psi; ion source gas 2, 50 psi. The
complete list of transitions and parameters can be found in Supporting Information Table S2. The employed
software was Analyst Version 1.6.2 (ABSciex).

Data Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed in
Microsoft Excel 2010 and R Studio 1.1.416. If not stated otherwise
in the text, a homoscedastic two-tailed student’s t test with a significance threshold of p < 0.01
was used.

Results and Discussion
Preserving the C1 Oxidation
State Information during Chemical
Stabilization of Folates by Derivatization
The pteridine
ring of C1 carrying folates is typically fully reduced to tetrahydrofolate
(THF, Figure 1B), and
C1 units are either attached to nitrogen 5 (N5), nitrogen 10 (N10),
or both forming a bridge between the nitrogen moieties. Unsurprisingly,
oxidation of the pteridine ring is one commonly observed degradation
reaction of folates, especially when N5 is unsubstituted. Oxidation
can be minimized by adding various antioxidants during extraction.
More severely, migration or loss of the C1 group can occur in a pH
dependent manner. Folates carrying C1 units at the oxidation level
of formic acid exist in a pH dependent equilibrium in protein free
form.16 Low pH (<4.5) strongly favors
5,10-methenyl THF, which in turn is unstable at higher pH and converts
to either 5-formyl THF or 10-formyl THF (Figure 1A). To prevent interconversion of the three
species, the free C1 binding site has to be chemically blocked. Both
N5 and N10 are secondary amines, and the choice of potential derivatization
reactions is limited by the aqueous environment. We have found that
unoccupied N5 and N10 are rapidly and quantitatively derivatized by
reductive methylation (Figure 1C), a method also used for isotopic labeling17 and stabilization of proteins.18 During derivatization, 5-formyl THF gets methylated at N10, yielding
the 5-formyl, 10-methyl THF (Figure 1D), and 10-formyl THF yields the N5-methyl, N10-formyl
derivative (Figure 1E). These two structural isomers can be separated by chromatography
and can additionally be discriminated by MS2 (Figure S1). Employing heavy isotope labeled reagents allows
discrimination between native and synthetic C1 groups of dimethylated
species, so derivatized 5-methyl THF (Figure 1F) can be distinguished from derivatized
THF (Figure 1G) by
mass spectrometry. Furthermore, since bridged species are reduced
by sodium cyanoborodeuteride, the initial oxidation state of the native
C1 unit is encoded in the isotopic composition of the derivative,
with lower oxidation states incorporating more deuterium (Figure 1H and I). Finally,
the pteridine ring of folic acid is also readily reduced by sodium
cyanoborodeuteride and subsequently methylated at N5. Dependent on
the initial oxidation state of the pteridine ring, either one (Figure 1J) or two deuteriums
(Figure 1K) are introduced
in the pteridine ring.

Taken together, derivatization results
in three structurally different and chemically stable analytes, which
greatly simplifies analysis and sample handling. Six of the initial
folate species are encoded as isotopologues (Figure S2), and a seventh isotopologue can easily be synthesized with
unlabeled reagents, providing an isotopic standard (Figure 1C) for derivatives of 5-methyl
THF, 5,10-methylene THF, and 5,10-methenyl THF, DHF, THF, and folic
acid.

Completeness, Selectivity, and Specificity
Completeness
of derivatization was assessed by running LC-MS analysis in product
ion scan mode (including m/z range
of unfragmented parent ions) for underivatized, single methylated,
doubly methylated, and triple (i.e., over-) methylated compounds.
The sum of signals for underivatized folates and side products was
below 4% of the expected product for all compounds. Among the side
products, triple methylated species were the most abundant (Figure S3).

Due to the limited resolution
of quadrupole technology, the minimal mass difference of 1 Da between
some parent and product masses is a potential source of experimental
error. We therefore carefully examined potential cross-talk between
channels at different quadrupole resolution settings using separate
standards. At unit quadrupole resolution and better, no cross-talk
between adjacent channels exceeding the expected effect from natural
isotope abundances was observed (Figure 2A). This experiment also shows the high specificity
of the derivatization reaction, as only the expected derivatization
product was observed for each folate. Since the enrichment of heavy
isotopes in labeling reagents is not complete (96–98% according
to vendor), also M-1 and M-2 species were considered. The true enrichment
of heavy isotopes is slightly higher as specified, as the measured
cross-talk was slightly lower for M-1 and M-2 species than the calculated
threshold. Accordingly, experimentally determined values were used
for subsequent deconvolution of signals. Deconvolution was performed
by solving linear equation systems using the solve function of the
R software suite.

Stability of Derivatives
After ensuring complete derivatization,
we next assessed the stability of the derivatized analytes and compared
it to native folates. Underivatized folates were dissolved in 50:50
methanol/water, 0.1% ascorbic acid, and 20 mM ammonium acetate, at
pH = 6.2 (as published by Lu et al.).15 After mixing, folates were incubated at 4 °C in the autosampler
and injected repeatedly over a time span of 96 h. As expected, the
addition of ascorbic acid effectively slowed oxidation of THF and
to some extent also DHF. However, at the near neutral pH, 5,10-methenyl
THF degraded with a t1/2 of <3 h at
4 °C to either 5- or 10-formyl THF (undistinguishable by the
method of Lu et al.). Moreover, it was highly unstable under the employed
chromatographic conditions (pH 9.2, 30 °C), and the signal at
the retention time of 10 min was only 11% (AUC) of that obtained by
flow injection. Another unstable folate is the 5,10-methylene folate,
which was reported to dissociate rapidly to formaldehyde and THF in
the absence of excess formaldehyde at nonalkaline pH.12,19 The t1/2 of this compound was below
30 min at 4 °C.

In contrast, the derivatized folates showed
excellent stability under both storage (pH = 4.5) and chromatographic
conditions (pH = 9.2), as can be seen in Figure 2B. To avoid any effects caused by further
sample preparation, no steps to remove excess sodium cyanoborodeuteride
were carried out. The resulting hydrogen bubble formation in the sample
vial is the reason for the fluctuations at the beginning of the stability
experiment. The stability experiment was carried out at 4 °C
to prevent evaporation of solvent after multiple injections from the
same sample vial. However, the derivatives also show good stability
at room temperature. This also enables preconcentration of extracts,
e.g., by using a rotary vacuum concentrator while maintaining the
ratios of individual folate species. An example of folate species
in an E. coli extract pre- and postconcentration
is shown in Figure 2C.

Sensitivity of the Method and Matrix Effects
Compared
to the methods by Lu et al.15 and Haandel
et al.,20 the sensitivity of the method
was improved for all monoglutamated folates, with the limit of detection
(LOD, signal-to-noise > 5) being <250 fg on column for all species.
Linearity of quantification was excellent for almost 4 orders of magnitude
with R2 ≥ 0.99 for all analytes
in the calibration range (250 fg to 1 μg) for both unweighted
and double logarithmically weighted regression (Supporting Information Figure S4).

As matrix effects
can play an important role in MS analysis, we tested for different
ionization efficiencies in different backgrounds by spiking two concentrations
of the light labeled dimethyl THF (Figure 1C) into extraction buffer, E. coli extract, and vacuum concentrated HepG2 cell extract, both derivatized
with heavy isotope labels. The observed area under the curve is compared
in Figure 2D. No significant
matrix effect was observed in the vacuum concentrated HepG2 cell extract.
However, a strong matrix effect was observed in unconcentrated E. coli lysate, with signal intensities amounting to only
45% of signal intensities in the spiked extraction buffer.

5-Formimino
THF
A potential source of C1 units not
covered so far is the histidine degradation product 5-formimino THF.
Unfortunately, no standard for 5-formimino THF is commercially available.
We therefore screened for the predicted derivatization product in E. coli extracts using a product ion scan method and were
able to identify two compounds corresponding to the triple and 4-fold
glutamated species. The retention times were consistent with other
triple and 4-fold glutamated folates, and the major MS2 fragment fits
the predicted heavy labeled, deglutamated 5-formimino THF. On the
basis of these data, we included transitions for all 5-formimino THF
glutamate species in the method.

Compatibility with Metabolites
Up- and Downstream of C1 Pathway
Primary and secondary amines
undergo reductive methylation under
the employed derivatization conditions. Hence, amino acids such as
glycine, serine, and methionine as well as their derivatives, e.g.,
S -adenosylmethionine (SAM), are dimethylated when stabilizing folate
species. However, this does not prevent their quantification, albeit
so far only qualitative measurements for these compounds have been
conducted. No derivatization was observed for nucleotides and nucleotide
building blocks included in the method. An overview of metabolites
covered by the method is shown in Figure 3, and the complete set of transitions is
listed in Supporting Information Table S2.

Application to Biological
Samples
We first reproduced
the trimethoprim inhibition experiment carried out by Lu et al.15 with the major difference that E. coli K12 was grown on complex (LB-Miller) instead of minimal medium.
We were able to reproduce the distribution of folylpolyglutamates
with n = 3 being most abundant in control cells,
followed by n = 4 and n = 5 (Figures 4 and 5A). For this purpose, all MRM peak areas of folate species
with a given polyglutamation number but regardless of their one carbon
load were summed up and normalized. It has to be noted that standards
with high polyglutamation numbers are not commercially available,
and the transitions for n = 7 and n = 8 are based on predicted retention times and calculated m/z for doubly charged parents. The folate
profile of the control group grown on complex medium differed markedly
from the profile reported for minimal medium. While the fully reduced
5-methyl THF was reported to be the dominant folate species on minimal
medium, 5,10-methenyl THF was the most abundant folate species in E. coli grown in complex medium, followed by 10-formyl THF.
With the capability of our method to distinguish between 5- and 10-formyl
THF, we can also conclude that polyglutamated 5-formyl THF is a minor
species under the employed conditions, with only polyglutamated folic
acid being lower (supplementary Figure S5).

coli K12 grown on complex medium.

Trimethoprim is an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase
(DHFR),
the enzyme that reduces both folic acid (via DHF) and DHF to THF.
DHFR activity is not only necessary to recycle DHF, which is produced
from 5,10-methylene THF during thymidine synthesis, but also for reduction
of folates de novo synthesized from dihydropteroate.
Accordingly, upon treatment of E. coli K12 with trimethoprim,
the growth of the treated group slowed, and most folate species carrying
one-carbon units decreased significantly. However, also the overall
distribution of folate polyglutamation levels changed severely, with
an increase of folates with both a low (n = 1–2)
and high glutamation (n = 4–6) number, while
folylpolyglutamate with n = 3 was strongly reduced
(Figure 4A). This is
likely an effect of the inhibition of folylpolygamma glutamate synthase
by accumulating DHF, as described by Kwon et al. and termed the “domino
effect.”22 In accordance with the
results of Kwon et al., we observed an increase of reduced folates
with a low glutamation number (n = 1–2) after
prolonged treatment (30 min) with trimethoprim. Interestingly, only
the THF species with three glutamates was reduced significantly in
our hands, while THF species with high glutamation numbers (n = 5–6) were increased in trimethoprim treated samples.
As our method also allows quantification of 5,10-methenyl THF, 5-formyl
THF, and 10-formyl THF individually, we are able to report that 5,10-methenyl
THF species with glutamation numbers n = 1–2
are upregulated, while those with glutamation numbers n = 3–5 are significantly decreased (Figure 4B) upon trimethoprim treatment. The most
severe decrease in both absolute and relative terms was observed for
10-formyl THF, which was found to be significantly downregulated with
glutamation numbers n = 3–6.

The massive
changes in folate distribution caused by DHFR inhibition
are also reflected in substrates and products of C1 transfer reactions.
Thymidine (TMP) was significantly downregulated in treated cells,
while the purine base biosynthetic intermediate AICAR was significantly
elevated (Figure 4C, p < 0.001). Interestingly, neither SAM nor S-adenosyhomocysteine
(SAH) were altered, indicating a precedence of the methylation system
over de novo nucleotide synthesis under the employed
conditions.

Methotrexate Treatment of HepG2 Hepatoma
Cells
While
trimethoprim is a potent inhibitor of bacterial DHFR and therefore
used as an antibiotic, inhibitors of mammalian DHFR are widely employed
in treatment of cancer and autoimmune disorders.23 To investigate differences in the response of bacterial
and mammalian systems to DHFR inhibition, we employed the antifolate
methotrexate to inhibit DHFR in the human hepatocellular carcinoma
cell line HepG2. In contrast to the bacterial system, no significant
increase of the oxidized pteridines was observed, with the exception
of DHF-Glu2 (data not shown). As expected, most of the reduced folates
were significantly lowered (Figure 4D). After 16 h of treatment with methotrexate, especially
folates with higher polyglutamation number were significantly decreased
(Figure 4E), and growth
was completely halted. The level of TMP was not significantly altered
despite the depletion of its biosynthetic precursor 5,10-methylen
THF, which might be an effect of the observed complete growth arrest.
Interestingly, inosine monophosphate (IMP) actually increased significantly
alongside AICAR, a tendency also observed in E. coli, albeit not passing the significance threshold. One possible explanation
for this is an increase in the nucleotide salvage pathway24 activity. Finally, both SAM (p < 0.02) and SAH were reduced significantly. The SAM/SAH ratio
was lower by trend in the methotrexate sample (although not significant, p = 0.075), which is in line with 5-methyl-THF depletion.
However, the fall of both SAM and SAH can be either explained by a
draining of the entire methionine pool (e.g., toward cysteine and
glutathione synthesis) or, more likely, a depletion of the adenosyl
pool, as ATP is also required for SAM biosynthesis.

Conclusion
Traditionally, the first step of folate analytics used to be enzymatic
deconjugation, i.e., the trimming of the polyglutamate tail to a single
glutamate.16 While this approach requires
a less sensitive analytical method since it pools several glutamation
states into one, it also sacrifices valuable information; for example,
the “domino effect” reported by Kwon et al.22 and reproduced here is not observable using
this approach. Another problem is the lengthy enzymatic deglutamation
step, which promotes interconversion and potential loss of unstable
folate species. Especially pteridine ring oxidation and subsequent
bond cleavage between the pteridine ring and para-aminobenzoyl glutamate
has been reported as one major pathway of folate degradation.25 Finally, the source of folate conjugase, which
is in most cases a crude preparation (i.e., charcoal treated) of rat
plasma, is a potential source of sample contamination given the low
hydrophobicity of even monoglutamated folates. With the availability
of highly sensitive LC-MS methods, the compromises made by deconjugation
have become unnecessary (Figure S6). The
first method published avoiding deconjugation was published already
13 years ago by Garratt et al., who used an ion pairing chromatography
setup to separate the highly hydrophilic folylpolyglutamates. In 2007,
Lu et al. published the first method analyzing folylpolyglutamates
on an HILIC column. However, even methods avoiding deconjugation suffer
from the low chemical stability of several folate species, making
their analysis a highly challenging task.

In this study we demonstrate
how in depth folate analysis is greatly
simplified by stabilizing folates by derivatization directly in the
quenching solution. In addition to the benefits of easier sample handling,
the sensitivity of the method is increased by more than 2 orders of
magnitude for the most unstable folates compared to nonderivatized
folate analytics. Notably, the sensitivity improvement of folates
considered more stable under the respective conditions was lower (factor
4 for 5-methyl THF and 20 for 5-formyl THF, respectively) than for
folates highly unstable at elevated pH (5,10-methenyl THF, factor
400 compared to Lu et al.). In contrast, Haandel et al. reported LODs
for 5,10-methenyl THF and 5-methyl THF (900 fg on column) for their
method using acidic extraction and LC conditions. However, under these
conditions, they did not provide any LODs for the acid labile analytes
5- and 10-formyl THF. Indeed, they used TCA acidified samples to quantify
the entirety of folates carrying C1 units at the formic acid oxidation
state as 5,10-methenyl THF. These prior reports thus underscore the
impracticality of assessing all underivatized folates in one method
and underpin the benefits of chemically stabilizing folates.

The method described here also allows discrimination of the structural
isomers 5-formyl THF and 10-formyl THF. The two analytes are baseline
separated by chromatography and can additionally be distinguished
by their fragmentation pattern26 (Figure S1). For a complete depiction of C1 metabolism,
we also included C1 donors and products of C1 metabolism in the method.
While some of the donors and products are also derivatized, this does
not hamper their analysis; in one special case, it is even beneficial.
The choline degradation products dimethylglycine, sarcosine, and glycine
are converted into three isotopologues carrying different numbers
of heavy methyl groups allowing a direct quantitative comparison.
Another advantage of our method is that folates in the sample will
be labeled with heavy isotopes during derivatization. This allows
the use of unlabeled standards derivatized with unlabeled reagents
as an isotopic standard rather than costly isotope labeled folates.

Conclusively, we have demonstrated how comprehensive folate analysis
can be greatly simplified by derivatization using heavy isotope labeled
reagents. This approach allows for the first time to analyze all cellular
folate species in one method with very high sensitivity. Six out of
a total of 9 (including 5-formimino THF) folate species measured are
encoded as isotopologues, and the high stability of the derivatives
allows prolonged sample storage and sample preparation steps such
as vacuum centrifugation. We hope that this method will catalyze a
surge of C1 metabolism research, providing a better understanding
of how this central biosynthetic pathway is regulated under varying
conditions and diseases. Considering that C1 metabolism is still a
major target of cancer drugs six decades after the initial steps in
chemotherapy,23,27 in depth analysis of folate profiles
of varying cancer types and their alterations by drugs is a paramount
objective. The greatly simplified sample handling will especially
be beneficial in a clinical setting, where strictly time controlled
sample preparation is often infeasible. Beyond that, determination
of folates in food and feed can also be improved using this approach.
