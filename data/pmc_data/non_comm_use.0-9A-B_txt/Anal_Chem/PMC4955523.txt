Collision cross section (CCS) measurement
of lipids using traveling
wave ion mobility-mass spectrometry (TWIM-MS) is of high interest
to the lipidomics field. However, currently available calibrants for
CCS measurement using TWIM are predominantly peptides that display
quite different physical properties and gas-phase conformations from
lipids, which could lead to large CCS calibration errors for lipids.
Here we report the direct CCS measurement of a series of phosphatidylcholines
(PCs) and phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) in nitrogen using a drift
tube ion mobility (DTIM) instrument and an evaluation of the accuracy
and reproducibility of PCs and PEs as CCS calibrants for phospholipids
against different classes of calibrants, including polyalanine (PolyAla),
tetraalkylammonium salts (TAA), and hexakis(fluoroalkoxy)phosphazines
(HFAP), in both positive and negative modes in TWIM-MS analysis. We
demonstrate that structurally mismatched calibrants lead to larger
errors in calibrated CCS values while the structurally matched calibrants,
PCs and PEs, gave highly accurate and reproducible CCS values at different
traveling wave parameters. Using the lipid calibrants, the majority
of the CCS values of several classes of phospholipids measured by
TWIM are within 2% error of the CCS values measured by DTIM. The development
of phospholipid CCS calibrants will enable high-accuracy structural
studies of lipids and add an additional level of validation in the
assignment of identifications in untargeted lipidomics experiments.

==== Body
Lipids are
essential components
of cell membranes and play important roles in normal physiology1,2 as well as in human diseases such as atherosclerosis,3 cancer,4,5 and diabetes.6 Over the past decade, the study of the complete
profile and pathways of lipids in biological systems, or lipidomics,
has emerged as an important new area of “omics” studies,7−10 making up a major component of metabolomics that is complementary
to genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. Advances in lipidomics
strategies are largely driven by the advancement of the mass spectrometry
(MS) techniques, which have led to two commonly used methodologies:
shotgun lipidomics11,12 and liquid chromatography (LC)–MS-based
lipidomics.8,13,14 However, one major challenge for lipidomics studies remains: the
narrow mass-to-charge (m/z) window
(m/z 600–900) in which lipids
are observed leads to a large number of lipid ions having the same
(i.e., isobaric) mass, which obscures the definitive identification
of many lipids. This challenge can be addressed by ion mobility-mass
spectrometry (IM-MS),15−19 which provides an orthogonal dimension of separation on the basis
of gas-phase structure and aids in the unambiguous identification
of isobaric lipid species.20−25

The separation of ions in the low-field IM experiment is based
on differences in the ion-neutral collision cross section (CCS) as
the ions drift through a neutral background gas, commonly helium or
nitrogen, under the influence of a static electric field (as in drift
tube IM, DTIM)21,26,27 or a dynamic electric field (as in traveling wave IM, TWIM).28,29 When coupled with MS, a two-dimensional separation is achieved,
which provides important molecular information due to the relationship
between mass (as indicated by the mass-to-charge, m/z) and CCS (as indicated by td) in the form of structural density.15−18 As a result, different classes
of biological molecules can be separated by IM-MS based on differences
in their gas phase packing efficiencies, where densely packed biomolecules
occur with a smaller CCS (shorter td)
than loosely packed species of a similar mass. As such, each class
of biomolecule occupies a discrete region of IM-MS space with lipids
on average occupying the largest CCSs, followed by peptides, carbohydrates,
and oligonucleotides.21−23 Structural separations may also be observed within
a biomolecular class, such as the separation of sphingolipids and
glycerophospholipids subspecies within the lipid class.21,24,26,30,31

Because of the wide availability of
commercial TWIM instruments,
CCS measurement on the TWIM platform is of high interest. While CCS
values can be directly determined from DTIM analysis using the Mason–Schamp
equation,32,33 a precise relationship between CCS and td in TWIM has not yet been developed, although
some progress has been made toward understanding the theory of TWIM.34−36 Thus, in order to determine CCS values using TWIM, it is necessary
to determine a calibration relationship between ions with known CCS
values obtained on DTIM instrumentation and the td measured in TWIMS. Commonly, a power regression analysis
is used for calibrating TWIM data to CCS as it has been observed that
CCS and td follow an empirical power function
relationship in TWIM,30,37−42 although both linear39,43 and binomial regressions have
also been utilized for TWIM calibration purposes.41

Major efforts have been devoted to developing TWIM
calibration
strategies for the analysis of peptides and proteins, such as the
use of tryptic peptides,30,39 denatured or native
proteins,37,38,40,44 and polyalanines (PolyAla).41 Small-molecule calibrants for masses of up to 609 Da have also been
reported.45 In recent years, PolyAla have
become the most widely used calibrant series due to their long-term
stability, even distribution of ions over a wide range of m/z and CCS, and ability to form several
charge states.41 Calibration of TWIM CCSs
using PolyAla has been reported in the literature for use with a range
of molecules, including small metabolites and lipids in both positive
and negative modes.24,42,46,47 However, it has been found on several occasions
that TWIM calibration using ions that are of different physical properties
could lead to large errors in calibrated CCSs. For example, calibration
of lipids using tryptic peptides led to errors up to 6.4%.30 In addition, Bush et al. found that for CCS
measurements of native proteins, native protein calibrants alone performed
better than a combination of native and denatured proteins or denatured
proteins alone.44 These errors are the
result of commonly observed differences between molecular classes:
(i) there is a mismatch in the m/z range in which the calibrants and the analytes occur as observed
in Bush et al.44 and (ii) the calibrant
and analyte experience different forces in the TWIM separation, such
as the ion–dipole interactions due to polarizability of the
N2 drift gas, which cause their drift times to scale differently
with CCS.48−50 To avoid errors in calibrated CCSs due to the above
and other sources, calibration using ions with similar physical properties
is desirable in order to achieve the highest CCS accuracy. Because
of the large structural differences between the lipid ions and those
of other classes of molecules in the gas phase,21−23 designated
lipid CCS calibrants are needed for TWIM analysis.

In this work,
we report the direct CCS measurements of a series
of phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs)
(ranging from m/z 400 to 1000) in
nitrogen using DTIM in both positive and negative-ion modes specifically
for use as lipid CCS calibrants in other IM instrumentation. The PE
and PC series were evaluated against different classes of calibrants,
including PolyAla, tetraalkylammonium salts (TAA), and hexakis(fluoroalkoxy)phosphazines
(HFAP), in both positive and negative modes to determine their accuracy
and reproducibility for calibration of lipid CCSs from TWIM analysis.
We demonstrate that structurally mismatched calibrants lead to larger
error in calibrated CCS values and establish two sets of structurally
matched lipid calibrants, PCs and PEs, for generating highly accurate
CCS values of lipids in TWIM analysis. To our knowledge, this work
represents the first systematic comparison of the effect of several
structurally distinct classes of calibrants on TWIM CCS measurement,
and the CCS of many of the lipid species presented here have not yet
been measured by DTIM, particularly in the context of both positive
and negative ion forms.

Experimental Section
Materials
A total
of 10 phosphatidylcholine (PC) and
14 phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipid standards (Avanti Polar Lipids)
with fatty acid tails ranging from 6 to 24 carbons were prepared as
separate samples for analysis in positive and negative modes (see Table S1 for a list of lipid species and Avanti
Polar Lipid catalog numbers). For positive mode analysis, mixtures
of PCs and PEs were prepared at 5–10 μM (concentration
of each species noted in Table S1) in methanol
(Sigma-Aldrich) with 0.1% formic acid (Fisher Scientific). For negative
mode analysis, mixtures of PEs and PCs were prepared at 5–10
μM (concentration of each species noted in Table S1) in methanol with 50 μM sodium hydroxide (Fisher
Scientific) and 150 μM ammonium acetate (Fisher Scientific),
respectively. Poly-dl-alanine (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared
at 25 μg/mL in 1:1 acetonitrile/water (Fisher Scientific) with
0.1% formic acid for positive mode analysis and without formic acid
for negative mode analysis. A mixture of tetraalkylammonium bromide
salts (TAA3, 5, 8 and 10, Acros Organics; TAA4, 6, 7, and 12, Sigma-Aldrich)
was prepared at 1 ng/mL in methanol. A mixture of hexakis(fluoroalkoxy)phosphazines
(HFAP, ESI-L low concentration tuning mixture, Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA) was prepared by 1:4 dilution with 95% acetonitrile
in water. Sphingomyelin (SM, porcine brain), phosphatidyl serines
(PS, porcine brain), PE (porcine brain), and PC (chicken egg) mixtures
(Avanti Polar Lipids) were prepared as 10 μM solutions in 95%
acetonitrile in water.

DTIM CCS Measurements
CCS measurements
for PolyAla,
PEs, PCs, and HFAP were performed in positive and negative ESI modes
using an Agilent 6560 IM-MS with nitrogen drift gas as described previously.26 The IM spectrometer portion of the instrument
was operated under conditions which optimize the IM resolving power
between 50 and 60 (t/Δt).51 PE and PC lipids were detected as protonated
and sodium coordinated adducts in the positive mode analysis, whereas
[M – H]− and [M + CH3COO]− species were observed in negative mode for PE and
PC lipids, respectively. CCS values were determined from the Mason–Schamp
equation as described previously.26 For
all ions, the CCS measurement precision was observed to be less than
1% RSD (see Tables S1–S3 for RSDs
for each ion individually), and mass measurement accuracy was ≤5
ppm. Negative mode measurements were performed on 2 separate days,
and the reported CCS values represent the weighted average of the
two experiments (n = 9 per day).

TWIM Analysis
and CCS Calibration
TWIM experiments
were performed over 3 days, with three data acquisitions (positive
mode, 1 min; negative mode, 2 min) per day for a total of nine data
points. Samples were directly infused into the ESI source of a Waters
Synapt G2-Si HDMS (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) at 10 μL/min for
positive mode and 30 μL/min for negative mode. Data was acquired
over m/z 50–1200 (to 1400
for HFAPs) in resolution mode (m/Δm = 20 000) with 550 m/s TWIM wave velocity and 40 V wave height
(see the Supporting Information for source
and IM parameters). Additional experiments for validation were performed
at varied wave heights and velocities (30, 35, 40 V and 450, 500,
550 m/s, respectively) and data was acquired over m/z 50–5000 to prevent roll over into the
next IM cycle at lower wave heights. Additionally, data was acquired
using a ramped wave velocity of 900–300 m/s (tuned to prevent
roll over into the next IM cycle) and 40 V over m/z 50 to 1200 (to 1400 for HFAPs). For the analysis
of lipid extracts, CCS calibration was performed against the PC sodium
adducts using a 500 m/s wave velocity and 40 V wave height.

Drift times were obtained for each analyte by generating an extracted
ion chromatogram (XIC) from the arrival time distribution function
in MassLynx v4.1 using the monoisotopic mass and a mass window of
±0.075 Da. XICs were smoothed using the mean method (1 smooth;
window size, ±1 scan) prior to reading the drift time from the
peak apex. TWIM drift times (td, ms) and
DTIM CCS (Ω, Å2) values were corrected as described
previously.38 The calibration curves were
generated in GraphPad Prism 5 by fitting the corrected drift time, td′, and the
corrected CCS, Ω′, to an equation of the form 1  where A′, t0, and B are fit parameters
and z is the ion charge state. This equation was
used to account for ion flight time in areas outside the IM cell, t0, and this method has been demonstrated to
result in better correlation to the regression model and more accurate
CCS values than the simple power regression model (without the t0 term).42

In both positive and negative modes, the three intraday replicates
were treated independently during the CCS calibration process (i.e.,
the number of points analyzed in negative mode for PEs and PCs were
42 and 30, respectively). Both species (+ H and + Na) observed in
positive mode were similarly treated independently, such that the
total number of points analyzed for PEs and PCs in positive mode were
85 and 60, respectively. Reported CCSs represent the average of nine
experiments and interday RSDs were below 0.5% for all TWIM CCSs (Tables S4–S17).

Results and Discussion
CCS Calibrants
The primary factors taken into consideration
for choosing CCS calibrants to evaluate for use with phospholipids
were: (i) ability to ionize in both positive and negative modes and/or
(ii) structural similarity to phospholipids. Figure 1a summarizes the four types of calibrants
evaluated: polyalanine (PolyAla, n = 12(+)/14(−)),41 tetralkylammonium (TAA, n =
8) salts,26,45 hexakis(fluoroalkoxy)phosphazines
(HFAP, n = 4), and glycerophospholipids (PC, n = 10; PE, n = 14) (see Figure S1 for the CCS plot in negative mode). All the CCS
values of the calibrants were measured on the same DTIM platform to
achieve a fair comparison between the different calibrants (see Experimental Section). Collectively, the calibrants
cover a range of m/z and CCS from
approximately 200–1250 m/z and 125–350 Å2, respectively, in both positive
and negative modes (Figures 1b and S1; see Tables S1–S3 for DTIM CCS values). The PC, PolyAla,
and HFAP calibrants were evaluated in both positive and negative ionization
modes, whereas the TAA salts were analyzed in positive mode only,
as TAA does not readily generate an anion form. Although larger analytes
(m/z ≥ 2000) are present
in the HFAP mix, only the four ions covering the range m/z 300–1250 (+ESI) were used for CCS calibration
purposes. Notably, the nonlipid calibrants exhibit both larger and
smaller CCS values than those of the lipids within the same mass range.
The conformational distribution of the calibrants in the CCS vs m/z 2D plot (Figure 1 and Figure S1) suggests that the molecular packing efficiencies, or gas-phase
densities, of these ions in the gas phase increase in the order of
TAA ≪ PC ≈ PE < PolyAla ≪ HFAP in the positive
mode and PC < PE < PolyAla ≪ HFAP in the negative mode.
These trends can be reasonably understood based on their structures:
each TAA contains four flexible hydrocarbon chains; each phospholipid
contains two flexible fatty ester chains; each PolyAla is comprised
of the same monomer (i.e., alanine) and can potentially form compact
structures via intramolecular hydrogen bonding; and each HFAP is made
of a rigid aromatic ring and heavier atoms such as fluorine and phosphorus
that greatly increase the density of the structure relative to other
calibrants of similar m/z.

CCS-m/z for each of the five calibrants
from + ESI DTIM-MS measurements in N2. For clarity, only
the protonated adducts of the PE and PC calibrants are shown.

In positive mode, the majority
of the CCS calibrants demonstrate
strong power relationships between CCS and m/z, with R2 > 0.99 for TAA,
PolyAla,
PCs (+ H and + Na), and HFAPs when fit to the equation y = axb.26 The TAA salts display the largest
exponent value being 0.625, followed by PCs (0.575), PEs (0.529),
PolyAla (0.496), and HFAPs (0.451). The PEs had the poorest fit (R2 = 0.988) due to the number of PEs with one
or two unsaturated fatty acids (n = 5) versus those
with fully saturated fatty acids (n = 9). Excluding
PEs with unsaturated fatty acids improved the fit of the PE mobility-mass
correlation for both the protonated and sodium coordinated species
(R2 = 0.9995), while the unsaturated PEs
alone have an R2 = 0.806 (Figure S2). In negative mode, linear regression
analysis provided a better fit to the data (all R2 > 0.99) than the power fitting for all calibrants
(HFAPs,
PolyAla, PCs, PEs), suggesting that the relationship between CCS and m/z is more linear in negative mode.

Comparison of Different Calibrants on Lipid CCS Measurement
A principal goal of this work is to evaluate the cross-calibration
of each class of phospholipids (i.e., PCs to calibrate PEs and PEs
to calibrate PCs), in comparison with other classes of calibrants:
PolyAla, HFAP, and TAA. For the TWIM analysis, we chose to carry out
initial studies at a wave velocity of 550 m/s and wave height of 40
V since these conditions were observed to give maximum separation
of the lipid ions without carrying over the ions to the next IM cycle. Figure 2 contains representative
TWIM CCS calibration curves for PC, PE, PolyAla, and HFAP from both
positive (open gray circles) and negative (filled black squares) mode
analyses, which were obtained using eq 1. For all analytes investigated, the resulting calibration
curves yielded regression values greater than 0.995 with averaged
calibration fit errors from 0.1 to 0.5% (Tables S4–S9). The most notable difference between the calibration
curves for the different calibrants is in the degree of curvature
in the fit. For example, the calibration curves for PolyAla (Figure 2c) and HFAP (Figure 2d), as well as TAA
(Figure S3), are slightly curved. However,
calibration curves for PE and PC are distinctly more linear as indicated
by the values of exponent B in eq 1 being closer to one. Comparison of the fit
parameter for the phospholipids relative to the other calibrants shows
that PEs and PCs yielded smaller values for fit parameter A′ and positive values greater than 1 for t0, whereas the other calibrants had larger values
of A′ and negative values below 1 for t0. These differences in fitting parameters provide
further evidence that lipid-specific calibrants are needed in order
to achieve the most accurate measurement of lipid CCS using TWIM.

Figure 2 TWIM CCS
calibration plots for A) PC, B) PE, C) PolyAla, and (D)
HFAP CCS calibrants, where Ω′ is the corrected drift
tube CCS and td′ is the mass-independent
drift time. Calibration was performed with wave settings of 40 V and
550 m/s. Plots from positive (open gray circles) and negative (filled
black squares) mode analyses are overlaid. The calibration equations
for each mode are also shown. All calibration fits had R2 ≥ 0.995.

The effects of using calibration curves such as those for
PolyAla,
TAA, HFAP, and the phospholipids to calculate CCS values for PEs and
PCs can be seen in Figure 3 (detailed calibration errors in Tables S10–S17), which presents the calibrated CCSs and the
±2% CCS bands (black dashed lines) based on the DTIM CCSs. For
positive mode analysis of PCs (Figure 3a), calibration with PolyAla and TAAs yield some cross
sections that deviate significantly (≥2%) from CCS values measured
on the DTIM instrumentation, notably within the intermediate mass
range. A similar trend is observed for PCs in negative mode (Figure 3b), where PolyAla
yields calibrated CCSs that have errors greater than +2% CCS for intermediate
masses. Calibration of PCs with HFAP and PEs provided the most accurate
results with errors within ±2% CCS in both positive and negative
modes.

and B) and PEs (C and D) at 550 m/s and 40 V. Each symbol represents
averaged (n = 9) calibrated CCS values from a different
calibrant. The dashed lines represent ±2% error from the drift
tube (DT) CCS values (black circles), fit to power functions in parts
A and C and linear functions in parts B and D. Calibrated CCSs for
PE 20:4/20:4 are shown as open markers in parts C and D as the DTIM
CCS of PE 20:4/20:4 was excluded from the fit of the ±2% error
lines. For clarity, only protonated adducts are shown in parts A and
C.

For positive mode analysis of
PEs (Figure 3c), PolyAla
and TAA calibrated CCS values
increasingly deviate from the DTIM CCSs as the PE species increase
in mass and size. The PolyAla calibration errors are predominantly
within the +2% CCS band, but calibration errors for TAA-calibrated
PEs exceed +2% starting with PE 10:0/10:0 at m/z 524.3. Alternatively, calibration of PEs with HFAP yields
CCSs with negative error in the low mass region and positive error
in the high mass region. The use of PCs for CCS calibration of PEs
works well in positive mode, with all calibrated CCSs within ±2%
of the DTIM CCSs. Calibration of PEs with PolyAla in negative mode
(Figure 3d) has a trend
similar to that observed in positive mode; however, the errors are
greater than 2% CCS for all PE species. As with the calibrated PC
results, the HFAP-calibrated PE CCS values in negative mode are well
within 2% error from the DTIM values. Calibration of PEs with PCs
in negative mode also yielded favorable results, with only PE 6:0/6:0
and 8:0/8:0 displaying errors great than 2%.

Overall, at wave
velocity of 550 m/s and wave height of 40 V, PCs
and PEs performed the best as the lipid CCS calibrants (see Table S4 for a summary of precision and accuracy
of the calibrants). In positive mode, average calibration errors comparable
to the fit errors (i.e., 0.1–0.5% error) observed from the
PC and PE calibration curves themselves. Average errors were higher
in negative mode but remained below 1% error. Calibration with HFAP
also provided accurate CCSs for PEs and PCs in both ionization modes,
with average errors ≤1%.

Effect of Wave Velocity
and Wave Height on Lipid CCS Calibration
To evaluate the
performance of PEs, PCs, and HFAP as lipid CCS
calibrants under different traveling wave parameters, the above experiments
were repeated using varied combinations of wave height (40, 35, and
30 V) and wave velocity (550, 500, and 450 m/s). Calibration of PEs
and PCs with HFAP yielded the largest average percent errors in positive
mode (Tables S18 and S20) due to dependencies
on both mass and traveling wave parameters. The error of the CCS calibration
decreased with decreasing wave height for both PEs and PCs (Figures S4 and S6), while calibration error increased
with decreasing wave velocity (i.e., lowest errors at 550 m/s and
30 V). The effects of traveling wave parameters on calibration error
were small in negative mode, where errors across all species and combinations
of wave height and velocity were within ±2% CCS. For HFAP-calibration
of PEs, the errors were relatively consistent over the mass range
with the exception of PE 20:4/20:4, which showed greater average calibration
errors in positive and negative modes. HFAP-calibrated PC species,
on the other hand, exhibited larger errors in the middle of the calibration
range which was most pronounced in positive mode, where the absolute
error ranged from −0.5% for PC 6:0/6:0 to +2.5% for the intermediate
PC species (i.e., PC 14:0/14:0–18:0/18:0).

Trends were
also observed in positive and negative modes for CCS calibration with
phospholipids at varied wave heights and wave velocities. Calibration
of PCs with PEs showed clear bias toward smaller PCs in positive mode,
with consistently small calibration errors up to PC 18:0/18:0 (<0.5%),
and larger errors for PC 20:0/20:0 to 24:0/24:0 (−0.5% to −2.5%)
(Figure 4A and Figure S7). The reverse effect was observed for
CCS calibration of PEs with PCs in negative mode, where calibration
errors were +0.5% to +3.5% for PEs 6:0/6:0 to 12:0/12:0 over all combinations
of wave height and velocity (Figure 4D and Figure S5). Calibration
errors for PC-calibrated PE CCSs in positive mode and PE-calibrated
PC CCSs in negative mode were consistently low across all TWIM parameters
with only PC 24:0/24:0 displaying errors greater than 1% (Figure 4B,C and Figures S5 and S7). In general, the calibration
bias appears to become more evident as the wave velocity decreases,
i.e., CCSs with large calibration errors tend to display even larger
errors at smaller wave velocity while the CCSs with smaller errors
are relatively consistent at all wave height and velocity (Figure 4 and Figures S5 and S7). These observations may be
due to the fact that in TWIM, under the conditions of lower wave heights
and higher wave velocities, the ions experience more structurally
selective roll-over events which better describe differences in their
gas-phase structure,36 and the corresponding
longer drift times would also serve to reduce the magnitude of time
measurement errors, such as bin averaging and IM peak centroiding.

(A) calibration of protonated PCs with PE CCSs in positive mode, (B)
calibration of PCs with PE CCS in negative mode, (C) calibration of
protonated PEs with PC CCSs in positive mode, (D) calibration of PEs
with PC CCSs in negative mode. A traveling wave height of 40 V was
used for all measurements.

Overall, PCs and PEs outperformed HFAP as the calibrants
for lipids
even though all three CCS calibrants displayed some calibration errors
that were dependent upon mass, size, or traveling wave parameters.
Additional experiments performed with a ramped wave velocity also
demonstrate the inconsistency of HFAP as CCS calibrants. Using a linearly
ramped wave velocity range of 900–300 m/s and a fixed wave
height of 40 V, the performance of PE and PC calibrants was consistent
with results obtained under static wave velocities whereas the performance
of HFAP diminished greatly when using the ramped wave velocity (Tables S22–S25). The inconsistencies in
the performance of HFAP as generalized CCS calibrants for TWIM is
likely the result of the low number of HFAP species (n = 4) used in these experiments. Although the HFAP ions chosen adequately
bracket the mass range typically observed for lipids, the limited
number of HFAP calibrants within the lipid m/z range was not sufficient to provide robust and accurate
calibration of lipid CCSs.

While the use of phospholipids as
TWIM CCS calibrants yielded the
most accurate calibrated CCSs for both PEs and PCs, the mass-dependent
calibration errors observed for PE-calibrated PC CCSs in positive
mode and PC-calibrated PE CCSs in negative mode merit further discussion
(Figure 4A,D). For
PC-calibrated PE CCSs in negative mode, the increase in calibration
errors with decreasing PE mass can likely be attributed to the different
negative ion species formed between PEs and PC lipids, specifically
deprotonated and acetate-adducted, respectively. While the PC headgroup
is 44 Da larger than the PE headgroup for the neutral species, this
mass difference becomes even larger when analyzing the negative ions
due to the need to form adducts for negative mode ionization of PC
species. The formation of acetate adducts (+ 59 Da) was chosen for
this analysis due to the frequent use of ammonium acetate as a buffer
in LC solvents, particularly for reverse phase and HILIC methods.
However, the formation of acetate adducts led to larger proportion
of structural changes to the PCs with shorter acyl chains (10:0/10:0
or smaller) than those with longer acyl chains. As a result, acetate
adduction decreases the structural similarity of PC negative ions
relative to PE negative ions with similar fatty acid compositions.
It has been reported that different metal ion adducts of PCs significantly
affect their CCS mobility-mass correlations in the positive mode,
with the bigger metal ions displaying a larger effect.21 On the other hand, the increased calibration
errors observed in positive mode for PE-calibrated PC CCSs with acyl
chains of 20 carbons or greater likely results from the lack of PE
calibrant species above 800 Da.

Unsaturation in the acyl chains
was found to affect the CCS and
the calibration accuracy. CCS measurements of PEs possessing the same
number of carbons and increasing degrees of unsaturation (i.e., PE
18:0/18:0, 18:0/18:1, and 18:1/18:1 in Table S1) demonstrate that the addition of double bonds leads to a reduction
in the CCS. Kim et al. have reported similar observations for the
addition of double bonds to the acyl chains of PCs, where the first
double bond led to a 5% reduction in drift time with a further 1%
reduction for each additional double bond.39 The reduction in CCS observed for additional double bonds in PEs
was 0.3 and 0.9% for acyl chains lengths of 18 and 16, respectively,
but no bias was observed in the CCS calibration of saturated versus
singly- or doubly unsaturated PEs. The single highly unsaturated PE
evaluated in this study, PE 20:4, deviated significantly (approximately
6%) from the PE and PC trendline in the CCS vs. m/z plot (Figure 1b) and tended to have greater calibration errors than
PEs with fewer or no double bonds (Tables S5 and S11), although all errors were within ±2% when calibration
was performed with PCs. Thus, a set of highly unsaturated phospholipid
CCS calibrants may be of benefit if TWIM CCS information for highly
unsaturated phospholipids is desired.

Validation of the Performance
of Lipid CCS Calibrants
To evaluate the performance of the
lipid CCS calibrants in an untargeted
lipidomics experiment, TWIM CCSs were obtained for the components
in SM, PS, PE, and PC extracts and compared against their DTIM CCS
values.26,52 The results from triplicate measurements
of the most abundant SMs and PSs (n = 5 each) are
shown in Table 1 (additional
results in Table S26). Notably, the absolute
errors between DTIM and TWIM CCSs were below 2% with the exception
of only two lipid species (PS 38:01 and PC 36:1) at 2.2%. The outstanding
performance of these lipid calibrants on lipid classes other than
PE and PC suggest that these calibrants may have broad application
in measurement of CCS of polar lipids using TWIM.

Conclusions
While
several sets of calibrants have been proposed for generating
calibrated CCSs from TWIM-MS platforms, we have found that the use
of structurally matched calibrants provides greater accuracy of calibrated
CCS for phospholipids than PolyAla and TAAs and greater consistency
over multiple traveling wave parameters than HFAPs. On the basis of
the observations described above, the best implementation of the proposed
phospholipid CCS calibrants was determined to be the use of PCs for
CCS calibration of phospholipids in positive mode and the use of PEs
for CCS calibration of phospholipids in negative mode. We believe
this work will equally benefit those laboratories who may choose to
use PolyAla for its ease-of-use and cost-effectiveness, in that the
inherent errors of using PolyAla to calibrate lipid CCSs are demonstrated
here for the first time. Although the cost of purchasing individual
standards is greater than that of premixed calibrants, the expense
is justifiable given the improved accuracy of calibrated CCSs provided
by the lipid calibrants relative to PolyAla or HFAP. The development
of phospholipid CCS calibrants will enable high-accuracy structural
studies of lipids and add an additional level of validation in the
assignment of identifications in untargeted lipidomics experiments.
