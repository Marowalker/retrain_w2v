Insulator-based
dielectrophoresis is a relatively new analytical
technique with a large potential for a number of applications, such
as sorting, separation, purification, fractionation, and preconcentration.
The application of insulator-based dielectrophoresis (iDEP) for biological
samples, however, requires the precise control of the microenvironment
with temporal and spatial resolution. Temperature variations during
an iDEP experiment are a critical aspect in iDEP since Joule heating
could lead to various detrimental effects hampering reproducibility.
Additionally, Joule heating can potentially induce thermal flow and
more importantly can degrade biomolecules and other biological species.
Here, we investigate temperature variations in iDEP devices experimentally
employing the thermosensitive dye Rhodamin B (RhB) and compare the
measured results with numerical simulations. We performed the temperature
measurement experiments at a relevant buffer conductivity range commonly
used for iDEP applications under applied electric potentials. To this
aim, we employed an in-channel measurement method and an alternative
method employing a thin film located slightly below the iDEP channel.
We found that the temperature does not deviate significantly from
room temperature at 100 μS/cm up to 3000 V applied such as in
protein iDEP experiments. At a conductivity of 300 μS/cm, such
as previously used for mitochondria iDEP experiments at 3000 V, the
temperature never exceeds 34 °C. This observation suggests that
temperature effects for iDEP of proteins and mitochondria under these
conditions are marginal. However, at larger conductivities (1 mS/cm)
and only at 3000 V applied, temperature increases were significant,
reaching a regime in which degradation is likely to occur. Moreover,
the thin layer method resulted in lower temperature enhancement which
was also confirmed with numerical simulations. We thus conclude that
the thin film method is preferable providing closer agreement with
numerical simulations and further since it does not depend on the
iDEP channel material. Overall, our study provides a thorough comparison
of two experimental techniques for direct temperature measurement,
which can be adapted to a variety of iDEP applications in the future.
The good agreement between simulation and experiment will also allow
one to assess temperature variations for iDEP devices prior to experiments.

Dielectrophoresis
(DEP) is a
powerful technique often implemented in microfluidic platforms and
has shown to serve as a versatile tool in many bioanalytical applications
for cells, organelles, crystals, and biomolecules.1−4 The analytical applications span
a number of methods such as separation, fractionation, purification,
preconcentration, and sorting. DEP is referred to as translational
motion of a particle or biomolecule under the influence of an inhomogeneous
electric field. The electric field gradients necessary for the occurrence
of DEP can be created mainly by integrating microelectrodes on a substrate5 or insulating topological structures integrated
within a microfluidic channel, named insulator-based dielectrophoresis
(iDEP).6,7

The application of iDEP has been demonstrated
with a variety of
designs including constrictions with various shapes,8−10 oil droplets,11 insulating post arrays
with various geometries,12−21 sawtooth devices,22,23 and serpentine channels.24 With iDEP devices, problems prevalent to electrode
based DEP, such as electrode fouling and electrode reactions interfering
with DEP, can be eliminated in the regions where DEP occurs.

Despite the aforementioned advantages over the electrode-based
applications, iDEP requires relatively high applied potentials to
create significant electric field gradients necessary to manipulate
sub-μm particles or even biomolecules. The application of high
electric fields leads to Joule heating which may result in temperature
elevation within the device. Elevated temperatures can have detrimental
influence on biological analytes of interest by affecting their viability,
biological functionality, and/or stability. Moreover, one would expect
a higher temperature rise at the regions of the localized electric
field (e.g., constrictions) in iDEP devices due to the large applied
electric fields in the order of several hundred up to a few thousand
volts necessary to manipulate sub-μm biological objects such
as organelles or biomolecules. For example, numerical simulations
performed previously by our group showed that the magnitude of the
electric field within iDEP devices can reach up to 106 V/m
and corresponding electric field gradients amount in as high as 1017 V2/m3.25 Arising temperature gradients may create an additional electrothermal
flow interfering with DEP. For the aforementioned reasons, most experimental
iDEP studies have been performed with low conductivity buffers. Although
some work has been reported with high conductivity buffers or even
physiological buffers,26−29 the direct influence of Joule heating on samples has to be alleviated
in some ways. Nevertheless, the degree of Joule heating mostly depends
on the buffer conductivity, applied potential, device dimension, and
insulating structure geometries. Therefore, for realization of iDEP
as a reliable analytical tool, it is of extreme importance to monitor
and control temperature within the device.

A variety of methods
has been employed to measure temperature in
microfluidic devices, such as integrated thermocouples,30−33 resistive sensors,34 NMR thermometry,35 or IR thermography.34 These methods are either hampered by low spatial resolution or as
in the case of IR thermography can only assess the temperature on
the outer surface of the device. Assessing temperature with high spatial
resolution can be achieved by addition of thermosensitive substances
to the working solutions such as liquid crystalline probes,36−38 semiconductor nanocrystals,39,40 and dyes with temperature
dependent optical properties.41−43 Rhodamine B (RhB) is the most
commonly used temperature sensitive dye which exhibits strong temperature
dependent fluorescence in the range of 0–100 °C.44 However, a serious issue arises when RhB is
used for polymer-based devices such as poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS),
commonly used for microfluidic applications. Small hydrophobic analytes
such as RhB are known to strongly adsorb on the PDMS surface and diffuse
into the PDMS due to its hydrophobic nature.45 Such dye adsorption leads to the fluctuation of the baseline fluorescence
intensity, resulting in false temperature reading.

In the past,
RhB incompatibility with PDMS was overcome by dynamic
coating of PDMS with chemical agents, such as a nonionic surfactant
Triton X-100 at high concentrations,46 sodium
dodecyl sulfate,47 Polybrene solution,48 a combination of ionic liquid and nonionic surfactant,49 and the immobilization of ∼10 nm SiO2 particles onto the PDMS surface.50 The undesirable fluorescence signal derived from the adsorbed dye
can also be distinguished from the dye in free solution and eliminated
by using fluorescence lifetime imaging.51 Moreover, Samy et al.52 employed an assembly
where thin PDMS saturated with RhB is sandwiched in between two glass
slides. By introducing such assembly, RhB can be physically separated
from the PDMS surface, therefore completely eliminating the adsorption
problem.

Temperature changes for DEP applications have been
investigated
previously. While experimental measurements were reported for eDEP,34,53 Joule heating effects have not yet been assessed experimentally
in iDEP to the best of our knowledge. In iDEP, several studies assessed
temperature in iDEP devices with theoretical models. For example,
Hawkins et al. investigated Joule heating and the effect of the resultant
electrothermal flow in iDEP.54 The influence
of Joule heating on electroosmotic flow was discussed by Sridharan
et al. where the temperature field was solved using numerical simulations.55 Another example was performed by Chaurey et
al. where temperature rise in a nanoconstriction device was numerically
simulated.56 Recently, Gallo-Villanueva
et al. reported a temperature increase obtained from numerical simulations
in PDMS iDEP devices.57 Additionally, Zhu
et al. demonstrated that the Joule heating effect reduces the particle
focusing and trapping due to DEP. However, the extent of temperature
rise due to Joule heating was not reported in their work.58

In this work, we experimentally investigate
fluorescence thermometry
using RhB dye for iDEP applications in PDMS/glass hybrid devices with
two methods. The first method enables in-channel temperature measurement
by introducing a zwitterionic additive to the buffer in order to prevent
RhB adsorption onto the PDMS microchannel surface. For the second
method, we adapted the sandwich approach by Samy et al.,52 where temperature was measured on a thin film
of PDMS located about 150 μm below the iDEP channel. Results
from both methods show similar temporal temperature variation trends;
however, the sandwich method provides ∼20 °C smaller temperature
change than the in-channel measurement method. In addition, we present
a numerical model, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental
results. Furthermore, we applied this temperature measurement technique
to the same conditions as previously employed to study iDEP behavior
of mitochondria. Our study revealed that the temperature changes are
marginal for low conductivity buffers, and therefore, the viability
of mitochondria and other biological species is not significantly
influenced through temperature variations in iDEP.

Microchip Fabrication
As shown schematically in Figure 1, the microfluidic device has dimensions of 100
μm width and 10 μm height with triangular insulating post
arrays integrated in the 1 cm long channel. The device was fabricated
with standard photo and soft lithographic techniques as described
previously.12 For in-channel temperature
measurement experiments (method A), the resultant PDMS piece as well
as a precleaned 150 μm thick glass slide was treated with oxygen
plasma (PDC-001 Harrick Plasma, Harrick, USA) for 60 s at the highest
RF setting to obtain a tight seal. For temperature measurement experiments
using a thin film of PDMS doped in RhB (method B), we followed the
experimental procedures previously reported.52

the edges of the channel and that of a row of posts, and the other
rows of posts are indicated by triangles. Scale bar is 30 μm.

Temperature Measurement
Experiments with iDEP Devices
For method A, the assembled
iDEP channel was filled with the desired
buffers. Three different buffers were tested: pH 8 phosphate buffer
at conductivity of 100 μS/cm, pH 8 phosphate buffer at 1 mS/cm
conductivity, and Buffer B (see Supporting Information for the buffer composition) at 300 μS/cm to examine the temperature
rise under the same conditions used in
mitochondria iDEP experiments. To each buffer, 10 μg/mL RhB and 25 mg/mL CHAPS
were added for method A. For method B, the
iDEP channel was filled with the buffer after assembly. To compare
with the result from method A, the phosphate buffers at the same conductivities
(100 μS/cm and 1 mS/cm) were used. For both methods A and B,
fluorescence intensities were recorded upon the application of potentials
between the inlet and outlet. For each applied potential, experiments
were repeated three times to test reproducibility. For each trial,
a single nominal temperature value was calculated by averaging the
temperature from the entire channel within the image. The average
temperature values from three trials were plotted as a function of
duration of potential application.

Temperature Calibration
To determine the correlation
between the fluorescence intensities of RhB and the corresponding
temperature change, two sets of experiments were performed for each
temperature measurement methodology. The detailed experimental protocol
is found in the Supporting Information.
For both methods, images were acquired at various temperatures from
room temperature up to ∼90 °C. For the calibration curve,
the fluorescent intensity measured at each temperature was normalized
with the intensity measured at room temperature. The resultant data
sets (normalized intensity vs temperature) were fitted with a third
order polynomial, as was previously performed for temperature measurement
with RhB.41

Detection and Data Analysis
RhB fluorescence intensity
was recorded either in the microchannel (method A) or in a sandwiched
thin PDMS layer underneath the microchannel (method B). For fluorescence
microscopy imaging, an inverted microscope (IX 71, Olympus, USA) with
a 40× objective (Olympus, USA), a mercury burner (U-RFL-T, Olympus,
USA), and an appropriate fluorescent filter set (Olympus, USA) containing
a 531/40 nm exciter, 562 nm dichroic, and 593/40 nm emitter was used.
Throughout the experiments, two neutral density filters of 12% and
25% were used in order to reduce the excitation light from the source.
In addition, sample exposure to the incoming light was controlled
by using an automatic shutter (Prior scientific, MA, USA) in order
to minimize photobleaching of the dye. Images were acquired at 10
ms/frame for the calibration experiments and 100 ms/frame for the
measurement in the microfluidic devices using a CCD camera (Quantum
512 SC, Photometrics, USA) and Micro-Manager software (University
of California, USA). Resultant images were analyzed with ImageJ software
(version 1.43).

Results and Discussion
A typical
iDEP structure is schematically shown in Figure 1. We have performed iDEP experiments with biomolecules
such as DNA59 and proteins12,13 previously with similar structures and more recently studied the
iDEP behavior of cell organelles such as mitochondria in similar devices.
Figure 1b provides a top view of the iDEP devices
and the corresponding electric field strength simulated numerically.
A DEP force acts on particles in the presence of inhomogeneous electric
fields. Figure 1c shows a snapshot of the iDEP
trapping of semimembranosus muscle mitochondria labeled with MitoTracker
Green under DC conditions in a triangular post device. These experiments
were carried out as described in a previous work60 as well as in the Supporting Information at a medium pH of ∼7.4 and 300 μS/cm conductivity.60 As shown in Figure 1c,
we observed negative DEP of mitochondria under
DC conditions with the application of 3000 V for a 1 cm channel. The
mitochondria showed three different modes of iDEP, related to wiggling
in-between posts, trap hopping, or iDEP trapping. Such effects could
arise due to aggregates of mitochondria exhibiting different DEP properties
than the single mitochondrion. The formation of aggregates might be
triggered by temperature increases under iDEP operation. In the following,
we thus assess temperature changes related to DC iDEP applications.
We compare experimental observations with numerical simulations and
test two different methods to measure temperature.

Calibration of the Temperature
Dependent Dye
We utilized
the temperature dependent fluorescence of RhB dye to probe temperature
within the iDEP device. We chose RhB due to its temperature dependent
quantum yield in a wide temperature range (0–100 °C),
and it is insensitive to pH changes over a solution pH above 6.44 The latter point is important especially when
using low ionic strength buffers commonly used in iDEP applications
since the buffers are susceptible to the pH change within the order
of ∼10 min under the application of large electric fields.61

First, a calibration curve was constructed
to determine the dependency of fluorescence intensity on temperature.
As described in the Experimental Section,
we examined two methods: method A and method B (see Figure 2). Therefore, each method required a separate temperature
calibration. For method A, RhB was directly added to the working solution
and its temperature dependent fluorescence intensity was measured
in a large chamber (1 mL in volume) where the solution temperature
was carefully controlled. For method B, a thin layer of PDMS was first
spin coated on a glass slide and cured to form a thin film. Subsequently,
the PDMS film was saturated with RhB dye by immersing it in 1 mM RhB
dye solution. The calibration experiment for method B was performed
by directly heating the thin PDMS film and measuring the fluorescence
intensities at various temperatures. For both methods, the resulting
fluorescence intensities measured at each temperature were normalized
to 25 °C and plotted as a function of temperature. The obtained
data sets were fit with a third order polynomial for method A (eq 1) and method B (eq 2); see
Figure S1, Supporting Information: 1   2  where T is temperature (in
°C) and x is the normalized intensity.

Figure 2 Schematic representation
of two methodologies employed to measure
temperature in iDEP microfluidic devices. The 2D schematics correspond
to the cross-section view of the iDEP device shown in Figure 1 (not to scale). (a) In method A, the channel (dotted
line) is filled with the RhB containing buffer (pink). (b) In method
B, a thick and thin glass slide sandwich the RhB doped thin PDMS film
located 150 μm below the channel. Channel is filled with the
desired working buffer which does not contain RhB (light blue).

We confirmed that the temperature
dependent fluorescence occurs
reversibly by performing the calibration experiment with increasing
as well as decreasing temperature. Both calibration curves (see Supporting Information) were similar to the previously
reported results by Ross et al.41 for the
in-channel calibration curve and Samy et al.52 for the thin-film calibration.

The Choice of Buffer Additive
for In-Channel Temperature Measurements
Using the aforementioned
calibration curves, we measured temperature
changes within our iDEP device by monitoring the fluctuation of the
fluorescence intensity. First, the in-channel temperature measurement
was performed by adding RhB dye to the working buffer. Note that RhB
is known to be incompatible with the hydrophobic PDMS surfaces on
which RhB tends to adsorb strongly.45 Indeed,
when using unmodified PDMS, we observed an increase of the baseline
fluorescence intensity even without applying potential, which translates
to a temperature decline below room temperature. Since this is physically
highly unlikely, we assumed it to be caused by RhB adsorption onto
the PDMS surface. The amount of adsorbed dye increases over time,
and the adsorption kinetics can vary depending on the conditions in
the channel (e.g., temperature).62 Therefore,
the dye adsorption onto the PDMS surface can lead to a false temperature
reading.

However, when we added the zwitterionic surfactant
CHAPS, the RhB adsorption was greatly suppressed. For further testing,
a series of dye adsorption experiments was performed using various
CHAPS concentrations within a large PDMS chamber similar to the ones
used for the calibration experiment. These experiments showed that
the chemical modification of the PDMS surface via CHAPS dynamic coating
above its critical micelle concentration (CMC) significantly suppresses
the dye adsorption onto the PDMS (data not shown). Although it has
been previously demonstrated that the chemical modification of PDMS
reduces RhB adsorption,46,47 the use of CHAPS as
a surface modification agent has not been reported to the best of
our knowledge. Using CHAPS as a surface modification agent has several
advantages for iDEP applications. First, CHAPS is known to improve
protein solubility in bioanalytical applications63 and has already been used for iDEP applications as an additive
to reduce protein aggregation.12 Moreover,
since the sulfobetaine-type detergent CHAPS is zwitterionic and has
no net charge at the pH range used in our experiments, its addition
does not significantly change the overall buffer conductivity.64 The latter point is important since relatively
low conductivity buffers are commonly used for iDEP experiments and
thus increasing buffer conductivity would lead to larger Joule heating
effects (see below).

In-Channel Temperature Measurements (Method
A)
First,
in-channel temperature measurements were performed by monitoring the
fluorescence intensity fluctuation with an addition of 25 mg/mL CHAPS
and 10 μg/mL RhB in the same working buffer used for the mitochondria
DEP experiment. Note that the severe photobleaching of the dye can
lead to large intensity variations; thus, sample exposure to the incoming
light was minimized by using an automated shutter. Additionally, the
extent of photobeaching was assessed prior to the temperature measurement
experiments by acquiring an image sequence without applying potential.
Since the intensity fluctuations fall within the error obtained from
the calibration measurements, we concluded that the contribution of
photobleaching to the overall fluorescence intensity is negligible
with this approach.

Subsequently, the maximum potential used
for the mitochondria DEP experiments (3000 V for a 1 cm channel) was
applied to study the maximum temperature rise within the channel using
the same buffer (buffer B, 300 μS/cm conductivity) used for
mitochondria DEP experiments. Figure 3 shows the temperature surface plot at time t after
the initiation of the potential application. These four images at t = 22, 102, 222, and 322 s reveal that the in-channel temperature
reaches the steady temperature of ∼34 °C in ∼3
min.

Figure 3 Temperature surface plot at various times after applying a DC potential
of 3000 V for a 1 cm channel using the same buffer as previously used
for mitochondria DEP experiments. Temperature evolution within the
iDEP channel reveals that the temperature does not exceed 34 °C.
White lines indicate the edges of the channel and that of triangular
insulating posts. The scale bar is 20 μm.

Next, we performed the temperature measurement within the
channel
at a conductivity of 100 μS/cm and 1 mS/cm prepared with phosphate
buffer. Since these two conductivities are in the range of commonly
used iDEP buffers, it is worthwhile to exploit the temperature change
with these conditions. Our iDEP device was filled with each buffer
containing 25 mg/mL CHAPS and 10 μg/mL RhB, and three different
potentials (100, 1000, and 3000 V) were tested for a 1 cm channel.
Figure 4a,b shows the in-channel temperature
plotted as a function of duration of potential application. In theory,
larger Joule heating is expected due to the localized high electric
fields between the tips of the triangular posts. However, we observed
that the spatial temperature variation in the vicinity of the insulating
post regions is less than the temperature resolution of 1 °C
estimated from the standard deviation of residuals from the polynomial
fit. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 4a, the
temperature increases less than 5 °C when using the 100 μS/cm
conductivity buffer even with the application of the highest potential
(3000 V). A significant temperature increase of up to ∼70 °C
(Figure 4b) was observed only when using 1
mS/cm buffer with the highest potential of 3000 V. Figure 4a,b also shows the temporal temperature transition,
demonstrating that it takes longer to reach a steady state temperature
for larger applied potentials. For example, in the case of 3000 V
with 1 mS/cm conductivity buffer, the temperature equilibrates at
∼70 °C after 150 s of potential application, while it
takes only 5 s in the case of 1000 V with 1 mS/cm buffer. The
small absolute temperature changes of ∼2 °C in the case
of 100 μS/cm conditions are within the range of the experimental
error (Figure 4a). The experimental method
thus does not allow one to resolve the temporal temperature changes
in this case.

Figure 4 (a,b) Experimentally and (c) numerically obtained temperature
resulted
from Joule heating inside of the iDEP channel, tested with various
conductivities and applied potentials. (a,b) Experimentally measured
temporal temperature variations using a phosphate buffer with conductivity
of (a) 100 μS/cm (∼0.6 mM) and (b) 1 mS/cm (∼5
mM). Three different potentials were tested for each conductivity
of 100 μS/cm (triangles) and 1 mS/cm (dots): 100 V (green), 1000
V (red), and 3000 V (blue) for a 1 cm
long channel. (c) Numerical simulation results showing the steady
state temperatures as a function of applied potential for the buffer
conductivity of 100 μS/cm (tringles) and 1 mS/cm (dots). Inset
shows the spatial temperature variations, revealing that the temperature
variation is ∼1.5 °C within the channel. (d) Temporal
temperature variations obtained numerically for 100 μS/cm (triangles)
and 1 mS/cm (dots) when 3000 V is applied.

To support the experimental results presented above, numerical
simulations were performed to model the Joule heating inside of the
channel as described in the Supporting Information in detail. First, steady-state simulations were performed to study
the temperature reached with each set of conductivities and applied
potentials. As shown in Figure 4c, the temperature
rise is less than 5 °C for all cases except when 3000 V is applied
with 1 mS/cm conductivity where the temperature increases significantly
up to ∼90 °C. The absolute temperature increase was in
excellent agreement with the experimental results at 100 and 1000
V; however, it deviated by about 20 °C for 3000 V applied at
1 mS/cm buffer conductivity. We attribute this discrepancy to the
increase in RhB adsorption onto the PDMS at exceptionally high temperatures
since adsorption kinetics is enhanced with increasing temperature.
We also investigated the spatial temperature changes in the iDEP post
regions. The temperature variation was negligible for the low conductivity
and low applied potentials. The numerical simulation result with 1 mS/cm at 3000 V however shows that
the highest
temperature was obtained between the tips of the posts and the overall
temperature varies spatially by ∼1.5 °C (see inset of
Figure 4c). This variation could not be
detected in experiments, since the numerically obtained temperature
variations fall within the experimental error. A comprehensive table
comparing experimentally measured temperature and numerical simulations
is provided in the Supporting Information.

Subsequently, the temperature transitions during the potential
application were investigated by performing time dependent simulations.
Figure 4d provides the resultant temporal variations
in temperature with the highest applied potential (3000 V) for 100
μS/cm and 1 mS/cm conductivity. The saturation temperature of
∼90 °C is higher than the experimentally obtained temperature
of ∼70 °C (see Figure 4b)
but similar to the steady state case (Figure 4c). Again, this discrepancy with measured temperatures can be attributed
to the enhanced RhB adsorption at elevated temperatures. Moreover,
we found that the numerical simulation also depends strongly on the
chosen heat transfer coefficient value (h), which
in turn greatly depends on the surrounding environment (i.e., air
flow rate). Especially for larger temperatures, this factor can affect
absolute temperature changes in the order of 10 °C. Nonetheless,
we found that the time scales at which the temperature saturation
occurs are similar for both experimental and simulation results. In
the case of the low conductivity buffer, temperature equilibrates
within a short period of time (<20 s), while it takes much longer
(∼150 s) with the high conductivity buffer.

Thin-PDMS Film
Temperature Measurement (Method B)
Next, we performed
the temperature measurement in the iDEP device
by using the thin-PDMS film methodology exploited previously.52 The experiment was performed using the 100 μS/cm
and 1 mS/cm buffer. However, no RhB or CHAPS were added to these buffers.
The change in fluorescence intensity was recorded for each applied
potential (100, 1000, and 3000 V) and analyzed similarly to the previous
in-channel experiment. The resulting temperature variations experimentally
measured in the film located 150 μm below the channel reveal
a large temperature rise up to ∼49 °C only when using
1 mS/cm conductivity at 3000 V (see in Figure 5a,b). In contrast, the temperature increase is less than 2 °C
for the lower potentials (100 and 1000 V) with 1 mS/cm as well as
all potentials tested with 100 μS/cm.

Figure 5 (a, b) Experimentally
and (c) numerically obtained temperature
resulted from Joule heating with various conductivities and applied
potentials. Temperature was measured on thin PDMS film located ∼150
μm below the iDEP channel. (a, b) Experimentally measured temporal
temperature variations using a phosphate buffer with conductivity
of (a) 100 μS/cm (∼0.6 mM) and (b) 1 mS/cm (∼5
mM). Three different potentials were tested for each conductivity:
100 V (green), 1000 V (red), and 3000 V (blue) for a 1 cm long channel.
(c) Temporal temperature variations obtained numerically for 100 μS/cm
(triangles) and 1 mS/cm on the film (filled circles) and in the channel
(nonfilled circles) when 3000 V is applied.

Next, the numerically obtained temperature transitions were
also
compared to the experimental results for method B. The temperature
values were obtained 150 μm below the channel from the same
numerical model as the in-channel cases however with a geometry adapted
to the sandwich method employing the thin-PDMS film. For simplicity,
a 1.15 mm thick glass composite at the bottom of the channel was employed
in the simulation domain instead of the sandwiched assembly. Figure 5c demonstrates the temporal temperature variation
with 100 μS/cm and 1 mS/cm conductivity at 3000 V, revealing
that the numerical model resulted in slightly lower values than the
experiments. The largest discrepancy between the experimentally measured
and numerically obtained temperatures on the film was found with 1
mS/cm conductivity at 3000 V with the steady temperature of ∼45
°C obtained numerically and ∼49 °C obtained experimentally.
This small inconsistency between the experiment and simulation can
be explained with deviations in the actual heat transfer coefficient
value (see above) or from the simplified geometry used in the numerical
simulation assuming a single thick glass layer (and not the glass/thin-PDMS
sandwich) without any restriction of heat transfer between the layers.
Despite the discrepancy, the numerical simulation generally captures
the trend presented by experiments such as the time frame to reach
the steady state temperature (∼150 s). Moreover, the same numerical
model allows the estimation of in-channel temperatures which resulted
in 3–4 °C higher than the temperature in the film (see

Comparison of the Two Approaches
for Temperature Measurements
The two temperature measurement
methods (method A and B) can be
used complementarily depending on the circumstances. Method A enables the direct
temperature measurement within the iDEP channel. Moreover, the measurement
of temporal and spatial variations is possible with this method. However,
when employing the in-channel method, to circumvent the issue of RhB
dye adsorption onto the PDMS surface, it is necessary to use an additional
surfactant such as CHAPS. As seen in Figures 4a,b and 5a,b, larger errors are found using
method A, which we could attribute to fluorescence intensity fluctuations
due to largely reduced but still not entirely suppressed dye adsorption
onto the PDMS even with the addition of CHAPS. Adsorption of RhB onto
the PDMS surface increases the baseline fluorescence intensity, leading
to underestimated temperature values as indicated by a comparison
to the numerical simulations especially at exceptionally elevated
temperatures. On the other hand, for method B the incompatibility
issue of RhB and PDMS is overcome by physically separating RhB from
the channel walls with a 150 μm thick glass slide. Moreover,
the thin film method could be used in parallel with the iDEP experiment
when the set up allows one to detect dual fluorescence from sample
analytes and RhB dye.

As a result of the numerical simulations,
we found that the temperature increase is marginal for all the conductivity
and potential cases using both method A and B except when the highest
potential of 3000 V was applied at 1 mS/cm conductivity. In this case,
the temperature increased up to ∼90 °C with method A and
∼45 °C in the film located 150 μm below the channel
with which the in-channel temperature can be estimated to be ∼49
°C by numerical simulation. Experimentally, the results from
both methods are in excellent agreement with the numerical simulation
for potentials <1000 V and low conductivity, showing marginal
temperature increases. Only in the case of 3000 V at 1 mS/cm conductivity,
the temperature changed significantly. In this case, method A resulted
in the saturation temperature of ∼70 °C as obtained from
experiments, whereas ∼49 °C was measured using method
B experimentally. We generally noted that, both experimentally and
numerically, temperatures obtained by method A are higher than the
temperature measured using method B. This might be caused by the difference
in thickness of the bottom glass slides employed in the two methods
(i.e., 150 μm in method A and 1 mm for method B). We assume
that the heat dissipation is enhanced with the thicker glass slide
(method B) with the conditions employed in our study, leading to the
lower saturation temperature. Furthermore, the time to reach the steady
state is similar for both methods. For example, the system takes ∼150
s to reach the saturation temperature in the case of 1 mS/cm at 3000
V using both methods (see Figures 4b and 5b).

Additionally, we assessed the temperature
change under the same
conditions where mitochondria iDEP was performed. Our results demonstrated
that the in-channel temperature does not exceed 34 °C in iDEP
experiments considering the application of an extreme potential as
high as 3000 V. Thus, it is expected that the mitochondria viability
is not significantly affected by Joule heating during iDEP experiments
and thus viable mitochondria can be subsequently used for further
analysis in other assays.

Apart from biomolecules and bioparticle
degradation, Joule heating
can also create electrothermal flow interfering with DEP. In the past,
numerical simulations were performed to assess the temperature change
due to Joule heating in iDEP devices as well as to evaluate the effect
of electrothermal flow on DEP.54 Chaurey
et al. numerically simulated the temperature change within a nanoconstriction
iDEP device and found that the temperature increased up to 43.4 °C
with an application of 350 V/cm field at the 100 nm constrictions
using 1 S/m conductivity buffer.56 In another
example, Sridharan et al. reported 52 °C temperature enhancements
with 470 μS/cm conductivity buffer with 600 V/cm.55 A larger temperature increase of 71 °C
was reported by Gallo-Villanueva et al. at a conductivity of 100 μS/cm
under an application of 750 V/cm in an iDEP device.57 As demonstrated in these examples, the degree of Joule
heating mainly depends on the buffer conductivity, applied potential,
device dimension, insulating structure geometries, and the microchannel
material. Our experimental temperature measurements fall in the range
of these previously reported theoretical studies. The direct comparison
of temperature measurements with the numerical simulations as presented
in our study shows excellent agreement for all cases and is still
reasonable for 1 mS/cm and the largest applied potential. We thus
postulate that the presented approach is robust and can be used for
a variety of iDEP applications in the future.

Conclusions
In this study, we experimentally quantified the temperature change
in iDEP devices, which occurs due to Joule heating upon application
of high electrical potentials. For an assessment of the arising temperature
variations, the thermosensitive optical property of RhB was utilized
by monitoring its temperature dependent fluorescence intensities.
We applied and evaluated two measurement methods experimentally: directly
in the microfluidic channel and slightly below in a thin film. With
the former method, in-channel temperature measurement becomes possible
in iDEP devices with temporal and spatial resolution with the addition
of the surfactant CHAPS to prevent RhB adsorption onto the PDMS surface.
However, in the presented study, the temperature variations were marginal
and below the error of calibration in the iDEP device and the investigated
conditions. Excellent spatial resolution was however provided by the
numerical simulation performed in parallel to the experimental study.

With the in-channel method, the incompatibility issue of RhB and
PDMS is greatly reduced and the experimental results showed excellent
agreement with the numerical simulations. Only at larger conductivity
(1 mS/cm) and large applied potential (3000 V), the experimental results
start deviating from the numerical models. The second method employing
a thin RhB saturated PDMS film underneath the microchannel showed
similar temporal trends than the in-channel method; however, absolute
temperature changes were smaller both experimentally and numerically.
The thicker glass layer is thus advantageous to reduce temperature
increases due to Joule heating in iDEP devices under the conditions
employed in our previous protein and mitochondria iDEP studies. Moreover,
the thin layer method will allow for elegant iDEP studies with fluorescent
analytes, while observing temperature changes with adequate fluorescence
optics simultaneously.

The two temperature measurement methods
investigated in this work
are easy to implement in iDEP microfluidic devices and complementary.
In summary, our study provides useful guidelines for experimental
temperature determination in iDEP devices, which allows one to assess
Joule heating effects in future iDEP applications but also provide
suitable numerical methods to estimate these changes prior to iDEP
experiments with precious biological samples.
