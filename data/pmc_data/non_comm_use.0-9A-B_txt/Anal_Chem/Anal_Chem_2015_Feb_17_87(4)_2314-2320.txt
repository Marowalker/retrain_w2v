This article presents a novel method
for selective acquisition
of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of microorganisms in-line
during fermentation, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an example. The position of the cells relative to the sensitive
region of the attenuated total reflection (ATR) FT-IR probe was controlled
by combing a commercially available ATR in-line probe with contact-free,
gentle particle manipulation by ultrasonic standing waves. A prototype
probe was successfully constructed, assembled, and tested in-line
during fed-batch fermentations of S. cerevisiae. Control over the position of the cells was achieved by tuning the
ultrasound frequency: 2.41 MHz was used for acquisition of spectra
of the cells (pushing frequency fp) and
1.87 MHz, for retracting the cells from the ATR element, therefore
allowing spectra of the medium to be acquired. Accumulation of storage
carbohydrates (trehalose and glycogen) inside the cells was induced
by a lack of a nitrogen source in the feed medium. These changes in
biochemical composition were visible in the spectra of the cells recorded
in-line during the application of fp and
could be verified by reference spectra of dried cell samples recorded
off-line with a FT-IR microscope. Comparison of the cell spectra with
spectra of trehalose, glycogen, glucose, and mannan, i.e., the major
carbohydrates present in S. cerevisiae, and principal components analysis revealed that the changes observed
in the cell spectra correlated well with the bands specific for trehalose
and glycogen. This proves the applicability and capability of ultrasound-enhanced
in-line ATR mid-IR spectroscopy as a real-time PAT method for the
in situ monitoring of cellular biochemistry during fermentation.

==== Body
Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR)
spectroscopy is an established method for at-line, online, and in-line
bioprocess analysis and monitoring, especially in the mid-IR region
(400–4000 cm–1). Because water, a strong
infrared absorber, is the most abundant solvent and maximum interaction
lengths are a few tens of micrometers, attenuated total reflection
(ATR) configurations are the most commonly used. The light is totally
reflected within an ATR element, resulting in an evanescent field
that interacts with the sample, with typical penetration depths of
approximately 1 to 2 μm.1 Multiple
reflections lead to enhanced interaction with the sample without having
to face the challenges encountered when measuring transmission (clogging,
path length changes due to pressure drops, etc.). Multivariate data
analysis can be used to extract chemical information from data (i.e.,
chemometrics); this makes quantification of spectroscopic measurements
possible. Lourenço et al.2 gave
a good general overview of optical spectroscopy methods in combination
with chemometrics used for bioreactor monitoring, including mid-IR
spectroscopy, whereas a mini-review by Landgrebe et al.3 summarizes recent applications of near- and mid-IR
spectroscopy for bioprocess monitoring. A frequently used chemometric
method is principal component analysis (PCA). ATR mid-IR spectroscopy
in combination with PCA has been, e.g., successfully used for the
classification and identification of chemical differences of edible
fats and oils,4Robusta and Arabica coffees,5 and injured and intact Listeria monocytogenes.6

For various bioprocesses, spectra
of media components and excreted
secondary metabolites have been recorded at-line,7−10 online, and in-line. Online bypass
systems were successfully used to monitor media composition and products11−13 and for pH control14 in different types
of bioprocesses. In-line ATR probes are realized using fiber optics
(typically, silver halide) or light conduits and are commercially
available. Doak and Phillips reported the first use of a conduit probe
to monitor Escherichia coli fermentation
in 1999;15 since then, numerous reports
of in-line, i.e., in situ (the more commonly used term in bioprocess
engineering), monitoring of fermentation have been published.16−20

Spectra of microorganisms are acquired at-line or off-line
and
allow for differentiation between physiological states, reflected
by biochemical composition and the quantification of secondary metabolites
accumulated inside cells. In most studies, transmission spectra of
washed, dried cells were measured, either by FT-IR microspectroscopy21,22 or with the dedicated microplate reader accessory HTS-XT for high-throughput
analysis (Bruker Optics).23−27 Transmission and ATR FT-IR microspectroscopy were successfully used
for the analysis and differentiation of physiological states in the
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.28−31 Jarute et al. presented the first online setup for the quantification
of poly beta-hydroxybutyic acid (PHB) in E. coli using a horizontal ATR in combination with a stopped-flow system.32 When the flow was on, spectra of the medium
were acquired; subsequently, the flow was switched off, and the cells
sedimented onto the ATR surface and thus spectra of the cells could
be acquired. Biofouling was avoided by chemical cleaning of the ATR
as necessary.

Ultrasound Particle Manipulation
Ultrasonic standing
wave fields, built up between an ultrasound transducer and a reflector,
are a contact-free, gentle method for manipulation of small particles
in suspension. Particle sizes between one and a few tens of micrometers
require ultrasound frequencies between 1 and 10 MHz. The axial acoustic
radiation force, i.e., in the direction of sound propagation, acting
on the particles depends on particle volume, the ultrasound frequency,
the acoustic energy density, i.e., the power that is transmitted into
the medium, and the acoustic contrast factor.33−35 The force results
in a pattern of planes that are half of a wavelength apart, into which
the particles are driven. These planes are either the pressure nodal
planes (i.e., the planes of minimum acoustic pressure) or the pressure
antinodal planes of the standing wave field, depending on the acoustic
contrast factor between the particles and the carrier medium. This,
in turn, depends on the ratio of the sound speeds and mass densities
between the particles and the medium; dense particles, like cells,
are driven into the pressure nodes of the standing wave field. Ultrasound
particle manipulation is not harmful to cells36,37 and is a state-of-the-art method for perfusion filtering of mammalian
cell cultures, where it is used to hold cells against a continuous
flow of medium.38−40

Ultrasound particle manipulation was used to
increase the robustness of online cell spectra acquisition (S. cerevisiae) in a setup similar to that of Jarute
et al.,32 by using the radiation force
to lift the cells off of the horizontal ATR surface, which acted as
ultrasound reflector.41 Furthermore, the
settling speed, and thus the measurement intervals, could be increased
by the formation of cell aggregates in the pressure nodal planes,
which sedimented faster than single cells once the ultrasound and
the flow were switched off. A major drawback of bypass setups are
sterility issues. This can be overcome by taking the system in-line.42 Radel et al. showed in 2010 that the combination
of ultrasound particle manipulation and a fiber optic ATR probe made
acquisition of mid-IR spectra of PTFE particles in stirred suspensions
possible.43 Here, the ATR element was oriented
vertically, and the particles were pushed against it by tuning the
ultrasound frequency such that a net acoustic radiation force acted
in the direction of the ATR element. In 2013, we showed that spectra
of S. cerevisiae could be acquired
with a prototype in-line applicable probe.44

This article presents a major step forward in this development:
an autoclavable, in-line ultrasound-enhanced fiber optic mid-IR ATR
probe constructed according to FDA guidelines and its application
during S. cerevisiae fermentation in-line
in a semi-industrial fermenter. Within fed-batch fermentation, the
cells were deliberately nitrogen-limited by the design of the media
and therefore started to accumulate storage carbohydrates, i.e., trehalose
and glycogen, which was investigated. We recently showed the possibility
of off-line quantification of these carbohydrates in whole S. cerevisiae by FT-IR microspectroscopy.31 Here, we investigated the possibility of monitoring
these biochemical changes in-line by comparing them to off-line reference
spectra and principal component analysis.

Experimental Section
Ultrasound-Enhanced
Fiber Optic ATR FT-IR Probe
Spectrometer and In-Line
Probe
FT-IR spectra were acquired
in-line with the process spectrometer ReactIR 15 equipped with an
attenuated total reflection DS DiComp (diamond) 9.5 mm probe connected
via a 1.5 m AgX (silver halide) fiber (all Mettler Toledo, Greifensee,
Switzerland). The spectrometer was equipped with a liquid nitrogen
cooled mercury–cadmium–telluride (MCT) detector. Spectra
were acquired with resolutions of 4 and 8 cm–1,
respectively, in the spectral region from 700 to 2800 cm–1 as the co-addition of 256 scans. iC IR 4.2 software (Mettler Toledo,
Greifensee, Switzerland) was used for acquisition and basic data manipulation
such as single-point baseline offset correction (1840 cm–1 set to zero). The DS DiComp probe was chosen due to its flat top,
which makes it especially suitable as a reflector for the ultrasonic
wave.

Ultrasound Technology: Material and Design Considerations
The fiber optic probe was equipped with an in-house-designed ultrasound
accessory that allowed for manipulation of particles in suspension
(Figure 1a,b). The materials were chosen with
consideration of FDA regulations, i.e., standard materials used in
biotechnology were applied (body, stainless steel material no. 1.4571/DIN
X6CrNiMoTi17-12-2; screws, stainless steel A4 (1.4404) (Bossard, Zug,
Switzerland); seals and O-rings, ZruElast and ZruElast FPM 75 shore
(both Zrunek, Vienna, Austria)). The ultrasound composite transducer
consisted of a 10 mm PZT (lead zirconium titante, type PIC 181, PI
Ceramics, Lederhose, Germany) disc with wrap-around silver electrodes
glued to a Macor cylinder with a one-component epoxy resin (Araldite
AV 171, Huntsman Advanced Materials, The Woodlands, TX, USA). The
assembled ultrasound-enhanced mid-IR ATR probe complies with the 3D
rule to avoid turbulent flow stagnation, i.e., indentations were limited
to three times their respective widths, and it is autoclavable in
situ (121 °C, 20 min). A modified (limited to 2.5 W max power
output) frequency power synthesizer (FPS 2540, SinePhase Instruments,
Hinterbrühl, Austria) connected to the PZT was used for ultrasound
signal generation and amplification; frequency and power were controlled
using a custom LabView script and GUI (National Instruments, Austin,
TX, USA). The distance between the ultrasound transducer and ATR probe
was adjusted to approximately 1.35 mm.

The working principle
is shown in the inset in Figure 1c: At retracting
frequency fr, cells are held in the pressure
nodal planes away from the evanescent field of the ATR probe, whereas
they are pushed against the ATR surface and thus into the evanescent
field when the pushing frequency fp is
applied.

ATR probe and the custom-built ultrasound accessory. (c) The two operating
modes. The cells and the evanescent field are magnified by a factor
of 10 in comparison to the other dimensions for visibility.

Laboratory FT-IR Spectrometers:
Reference Spectra
Reference
spectra of glucose, trehalose, and mannan solutions and glycogen mixed
with H2O were acquired with a Tensor 37 FT-IR spectrometer
equipped with a DTGS (deuterated triglycine sulfate) detector using
a Platinum diamond ATR (all Bruker Optics, Ettlingen, Germany). Instrument
control and spectrum acquisition were performed with OPUS 7 software
(Bruker Optics). Spectral resolution was set to 2 cm–1, and spectra were recorded as the co-addition of 32 scans.

Sampling, pretreatment of the off-line samples, and acquisition of
reference spectra of dried yeast samples drawn during fermentation
have been described elsewhere.31

S. cerevisiae Cultivations
Fermentation
of S. cerevisiae (strain
CBS8340) was carried out in two different, fully automated and controlled
stirred bioreactors: a 10 L glass/steel bioreactor (Chemap, Switzerland)
and a 15 L steel bioreactor (Infors, Bottmingen, Switzerland). Both
were equipped with 25 mm Ingold ports for coupling with the ultrasound-enhanced
mid-IR ATR probe. Media preparation and cultivation conditions are
described in detail in the Supporting Information (Experimental, page S2, and Table S1, page S2); the stirring speed
was varied (800–1200 rpm), and the pO2 level was
always kept above 80% by adjusting the inflow of air. CO2 content of the off-gas was measured using an off-gas analyzer (Bluesens,
Snirgelskamp, Germany). Biomass was determined off-line by measuring
the optical density at 600 nm with a Genesys 20 visible spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

After the batch phase
on glucose was completed, the bioprocess was carried on as a C-limited
fed-batch with an exponential feed strategy. The feed medium was deficient
in a nitrogen source. Under C-limited feeding conditions, no excess
carbon source was present in the medium. The nitrogen limitation led
to the synthesis and accumulation of storage carbohydrates, i.e.,
trehalose and glycogen, inside the cells.

Experimental Procedure
for Ultrasound-Enhanced Mid-IR Spectroscopy
During fermentations, fp was 2.410 MHz
at 1.8–1.9 W true electrical power input (t.e.p.i.), and fr was 1.870 MHz at 1.6 W t.e.p.i.

Data Analysis
Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) and
the PLS toolbox (Eigenvector Research, Wenatchee, WA, USA) were used
for data manipulation and PCA. For PCA, the spectra were area normalized
in the carbohydrate region (938–1186 cm–1) prior to calculation of the second derivate (Savitzky-Golay, second
order, window width 9 or 11 depending on spectral resolution). Single-analyte
spectra were normalized and differentiated using the same settings
for comparison.

Results and Discussion
In-Line Procedure
Spectra were acquired in-line during
fermentation, alternating between pushing and retracting frequency
every 10 min. Three FT-IR spectra were acquired at each ultrasound
frequency; they were subsequently averaged for further data analysis,
resulting in a single, average, spectrum for each frequency application.
The background was acquired in batch medium with the probe in its
final position in the bioreactor after autoclaving. This was used
as the background for the absorbance spectra of the medium, i.e.,
spectra recorded during the application of the retracting frequency.
Absorbance spectra of the cells were calculated as difference spectra
between a spectrum acquired during the application of the pushing
frequency and the respective previous media spectrum (Figure 2). This was necessary to compensate for changes
in the medium composition, as there is always medium in the probed
volume and analyte concentrations are higher (and vary stronger over
the course of the fermentation) in the medium than in the cells themselves.
Samples were drawn from the bioreactor at different times for biomass
determination and the acquisition of cell reference spectra.

frequency (middle) and their difference spectrum showing typical spectral
features of yeast cells.

Optimization of Experimental Conditions
In total, four
fermentations were conducted; the influence of the ultrasound frequency
for pushing and retracting, stirring speed, and spectral and temporal
resolution were investigated, and the optima were subsequently used.
The highest yeast-related absorption values in difference spectra
were found using a pushing frequency of 2.410 MHz and a power of 1.8–1.9
W t.e.p.i. (fp). For retracting the particles
from the evanescent field of the ATR element, the ultrasound transducer
was driven around fr 1.870 MHz (at 1.6
W t.e.p.i.). Stirring speeds between 600 and 1200 rpm were tested:
an increase in stirring speed led to a decrease of absorption values
of the recorded spectra due to Stokes drag (data not shown). As a
compromise between sufficient stirring and satisfactory signal of
the mid-IR spectra of cells, a stirring speed of 800 rpm was identified.
Comparison of spectral resolutions of 4 and 8 cm–1 showed that the broad absorption bands of S. cerevisiae were sufficiently resolved by the latter (data not shown). Temporal
resolution was governed by spectrum acquisition time (i.e., 1 min
at 8 cm–1 resolution and co-addition of 256 scans),
sufficient data redundancy (in case of erroneous spectra and to increase
the signal-to-noise ratio), and maximum handleable file size. Spectra
were acquired every 2 min; thus, as mentioned before, three spectra
were available for averaging during alternating application of the
ultrasound frequencies for 10 min each. These parameters were determined
during the first fermentation and were subsequently used. The spectra
recorded during the four fermentations showed similar trends, and
an exemplary one will be presented here.

Influence of Growth Conditions
on Yeast Cells
In order
to study changes on the (bio)chemical composition of the cells, the
fermentation was carried out in two parts: a batch phase, with an
excess of glucose (C-source) and ammonium (N-source), and subsequently
a C-limited fed-batch phase during which no additional N-source was
fed and trehalose and glycogen were accumulated inside the cells.

Batch Phase
At the beginning of the batch phase, glucose
was present in excess in the medium, leading to the production of
ethanol as a main metabolite in addition to biomass (Crabtree effect,
overflow metabolism). The cells exhibited characteristic diauxic growth:
first, glucose was metabolized to ethanol in parallel with biomass
formation (0–12 h) and then, after a short lag phase, the extracellular
ethanol was metabolized as a carbon source (12–20 h). This
was reflected by the CO2 off-gas profile and the FT-IR
spectra of the medium (Figure 3). Characteristic
spectral features of glucose were predominant at first (Figure 3b, dark red spectra, bands at 1150, 1110, 1080,
and 1037 cm–1) followed by a superposition of glucose
and ethanol (light red spectra). Once the glucose was depleted, ethanol
dominated the FT-IR spectra, with its characteristic bands at 1045
and 1080 cm–1 (blue spectra), which gradually decreased
until the end of the batch phase (light blue spectrum).

Figure 3 (a) CO2 off-gas and biomass over the course of the batch
phase. (b) ATR FT-IR spectra of the medium (i.e., retracting frequency
applied) over the course of the batch phase.

During batch phase, yeast cell composition did not change;
only
biomass growth occurred, which was reflected by an increase in absorbance
over time, whereas spectral features remained similar (see Supporting Information Figure S1).

Fed-Batch Phase
The spectra of dried S. cerevisiae fed-batch samples acquired off-line
(Figure 4a) show spectral features typical
for the constituents of biological cells (from refs (45 and 46)): The C=O stretching of
ester groups in lipids leads to an absorption around 1730 cm–1. Proteins lead to absorptions around 1655 cm–1 (amide I band, mainly from C=O stretching and, to a lesser
extent, N–H bend and C–N stretch), around 1550 cm–1 (amide II band, N–H bend, and C–N stretch),
and around 1300 cm–1 (amide III band, complex combination
of different vibrations). In the region between 1450 and 1200 cm–1, numerous C–H and O–H deformation vibrations
contribute to the spectrum (lipids, carbohydrates). Antisymmetric
PO2– stretching vibrations of DNA, RNA,
and phospholipids lead to absorptions around 1240 cm–1. The region between 950 and 1200 cm–1 (hereafter,
carbohydrate region) is dominated by C–O stretching originating
from carbohydrates, with contributions around 1100 cm–1 from symmetric PO2– stretching (again,
DNA, RNA, and phosopholipids).

The changes in carbohydrate content
induced by N-limited growth are reflected by changes in the shape
of the spectra acquired off-line (Figure 4a,
normalized to the amide I band). The relative carbohydrate content
increases with fermentation time, and the shape of the carbohydrate
region changes as trehalose and glycogen are formed in the cells.
The carbohydrate bands of the difference spectra of the cells acquired
in-line at the time points of sampling (Figure 4b, offset baseline corrected) are in good agreement with the off-line
spectra (Figure 4a). Differences can be attributed
to matrix influence, band shifts due to acquisition in ATR mode, and
the lower signal-to-noise ratio for in-line spectra.

Figure 4 (a) Spectra of dried S. cerevisiae acquired off-line using a laboratory
FT-IR microscope (normalized
to amide I band). (b) Spectra of S. cerevisiae acquired in-line using the ultrasound-enhanced mid-IR ATR probe
at the times when samples for off-line analysis were drawn.

A major difference between the
off- and in-line measurements was
observed in the amide I and amide II regions: here, H2O
absorbs strongly (H–O–H bending at approximately 1640
cm–1) and therefore the intensity reaching the detector
is low, leading to a high noise level. The protein bands (amide I
and II) are only weakly visible in the in-line spectra, most likely
because the H2O present when the fr spectrum is acquired is simply replaced by the protein present
in S. cerevisiae when fp is applied, leading to approximately the same absorption.
Furthermore, when fp is applied, H2O is, for the most part but never completely, replaced by
yeast cells (even assuming close packing of equal spheres, approximately
26% of the space would still be occupied by H2O).

Since changes associated with switching to nitrogen-limited growth
are mainly visible in the carbohydrate region of the FT-IR spectra,
further analysis was focused on this region. The main carbohydrates
of yeast were studied: mannan, a cell wall polysaccharide composed
of mannose units, and intracellular carbohydrates trehalose, a disaccharide
of glucose, glycogen, a polysaccharide of glucose, and glucose. ATR
FT-IR reference spectra of the major carbohydrates (area normalized
as described in the Experimental Section)
present in yeast cells are shown in Figure 5a. At 994 cm–1, trehalose, one of the storage carbohydrates
accumulated during N-limited growth, has an intense and specific absorption.
In the spectral region between 1025 and 1175 cm–1, trehalose and glucose show bands at similar positions; their relative
intensities are, however, different. Glucose absorbs strongest at
1035 cm–1, whereas the relative absorption maximum
of trehalose in this region is shifted toward slightly higher wavenumbers
and is lower in intensity. At around 1155 cm–1,
trehalose and glycogen have a common absorption band. Glycogen absorbs
broadly between 970 and 1170 cm–1, with a distinct
maximum at 1022 cm–1 and smaller maxima at 1080
and 1152 cm–1. Mannan has a broad absorption band
between 1000 and 1150 cm–1, with a distinct maximum
at 1060 cm–1. The exact positions of absorption
maxima are even clearer when looking at second derivatives of the
spectra: maxima in the spectra are minima here (Figure 5b, top).

Figure 5 (a) Spectra of major carbohydrates present in yeast cells
(off-line
ATR, in solution) and spectra of yeast cells acquired in-line over
the course of the fermentation. (b) Second-derivative spectra of major
carbohydrates present in yeast cells and of yeast cells acquired over
the course of the fermentation, respectively. In both graphs, carbohydrate
spectra are offset for better visibility.

In the yeast, changes in the carbohydrate composition can
be observed
by spectra acquired in-line as difference spectra over the course
of the N-limited fed-batch fermentation (Figure 5a, bottom). The shape of the carbohydrate band changed with fermentation
time, most notably between 1050 and 950 cm–1. The
blue spectra, which were acquired toward the end of the fermentation,
show higher absorption around 990 cm–1, correlating
well with the absorption spectra of trehalose. This becomes even clearer
when investigating second-derivate spectra: The decrease around 994
cm–1 and the increase around 970 cm–1 in the spectra acquired toward the end of the fermentation (blue)
correlate well with the trehalose second-derivative spectrum (gray).
Between 1030 and 1000 cm–1, the slope of the second-derivative
yeast spectra steepens with fermentation time. The minimum at ∼1150
cm–1, which further decreases with fermentation
time, correlates with an increase in both glycogen and trehalose.
Since this minimum is less pronounced for trehalose compared to the
one at 994 cm–1, it can be concluded that glycogen
mainly contributes to this change.

PCA
We have recently
shown that quantitative determination
of carbohydrates is possible from off-line yeast spectra;31 from the in-line difference spectra, only qualitative
information on the changes in carbohydrate composition could be observed.
Normalization of the spectra proved to be difficult because changes
in biomass and in the carbohydrate content occurred simultaneously,
and this correlation could not be broken. To evaluate if the trends
observed in the in-line difference spectra are statistically detectable
and related to carbohydrate features, PCA was performed on the second-derivative
spectra.

Individual PCA of the four fermentations resulted in
very similar principal component 1 (PC1), which explained between
53 and 73% of the variation in the respective fermentation spectra.
A PCA of the combined spectra from all four fermentations again resulted
in a PC1 with very similar features; however, only 40% of the variance
was explained. This can be attributed to interfermentation variations
leading a smaller contribution from changes induced by N-limited growth.
To concentrate on the biochemical changes inside the cells, the following
discussion is based on the PCA of a single fermentation.

The
loading vector of PC1 and the second-derivative spectra of
trehalose, glycogen, glucose, and mannan show similar features (Figure 6). Spectral region A (1020–970 cm–1) of PC1 correlates with trehalose: the minimum is around 995 cm–1 for both, followed by a maximum at 980 cm–1 and a shoulder around 960 cm–1. This region also
varies the most between spectra, reflected by the highest values of
the first loading vector. The plateau at 1035 cm–1 followed by a minimum around 1025 cm–1 in PC1
correlates with glycogen, superimposed with trehalose and glucose
(thus, the shift of the minimum toward higher wavenumbers). In spectral
region B (1050 to 1103 cm–1), trehalose, glycogen,
glucose, and PC1 show very similar features, and a clear attribution
cannot be made. Around 1155 cm–1 (spectral region
C), the minimum in PC1 corresponds to a superposition of the minima
of both trehalose and glycogen.

glycogen, glucose, and
mannan and PC1 of spectra acquired during N-limited growth.

Conclusions and Outlook
The presented method allows for the selective acquisition of mid-IR
spectra of either dissolved analytes (media components) or suspended
particles (cells). This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first
report on the acquisition of mid-IR spectra of microorganisms (S. cerevisiae) inside a semi-industrial bioreactor
during fermentation without the necessity of drawing a sample. The
cell spectra acquired in-line are in good agreement with spectra of
dried cell samples that were recorded off-line. Trends in the changes
of the biochemical composition of the cells during N-limited fed-batch
fermentation were visible, showing the potential of ultrasound-enhanced
ATR mid-IR spectroscopy to be used as a PAT (process analytical technology)
probe to detect the cells’ physiological response to nutritional
limitations. Quantitative analysis proved to be difficult, as the
number of cells present in the evanescent field is hard to estimate
and the amide I band, which could be used for normalization off-line,
was not accessible in-line. Furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratio
of the difference spectra still needs to be improved to make quantitative
analysis by, e.g., partial least-squares regression possible. More
insight into the spatial distribution of the cells in the evanescent
field could potentially be gained using the gel method proposed by
Gherardini et al.;47 with a better understanding
of the number of cells held in the evanescent field at a given time
under different conditions, the before-mentioned challenges will be
addressed in a follow-up project.

The described novel method
is generic and suitable for (ideally
spherical) cells within a size range of 1 to approximately 40 μm,
as is often employed in white and red biotechnology and biorefinery.
It delivers real-time information on the chemical composition of cells
in situ, thus aiding the optimization of process conditions and media
composition. Moreover, physiological responses of cells can be investigated,
helping to obtain a basic understanding of cell physiology/metabolism.
In industrial fermentation, the method could serve as a quality control
tool: here, complex media are often employed, for which exact determination
of nutrient concentrations would usually require extensive and laborious
chemical analyses or is not possible at all. By measuring the cell’s
biochemical composition, potential limitations could be detected,
and appropriate measures to ensure the desired quality could be taken
early in the process.

Apart from bioprocesses, the presented
method can, for example,
be applied to gain insight into crystallization processes.
