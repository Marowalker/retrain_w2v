We
present a new approach for the sensitive detection and accurate
quantitation of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) gene transcripts
in single cells. First, the entire population of mRNAs is encoded
with molecular barcodes during reverse transcription. After amplification
of the gene targets of interest, molecular barcodes are counted by
sequencing or scored on a simple hybridization detector to reveal
the number of molecules in the starting sample. Since absolute quantities
are measured, calibration to standards is unnecessary, and many of
the relative quantitation challenges such as polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) bias are avoided. We apply the method to gene expression analysis
of minute sample quantities and demonstrate precise measurements with
sensitivity down to sub single-cell levels. The method is an easy,
single-tube, end point assay utilizing standard thermal cyclers and
PCR reagents. Accurate and precise measurements are obtained without
any need for cycle-to-cycle intensity-based real-time monitoring or
physical partitioning into multiple reactions (e.g., digital PCR).
Further, since all mRNA molecules are encoded with molecular barcodes,
amplification can be used to generate more material for multiple measurements
and technical replicates can be carried out on limited samples. The
method is particularly useful for small sample quantities, such as
single-cell experiments. Digital encoding of cellular content preserves
true abundance levels and overcomes distortions introduced by amplification.

Single cell gene expression
studies have increased our understanding of the function of individual
cells in normal development and disease. Due to the limited messenger
ribonucleic acid (mRNA) amount in a cell, ultrasensitive methods are
necessary for reliable detection. Single cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
has been applied for profiling entire transcriptomes.1−7 Many methods use Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) template switching
(TS) to incorporate a universal primer site during oligo-dT primed
complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis when reverse transcription (RT)
reaches mRNA 5′ ends.8 Universal
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is subsequently applied to amplify
cDNAs for sequencing. TS has become increasingly popular because of
fewer protocol steps, high overall efficiency, and the ability to
represent full-length transcripts. However, questions regarding the
sensitivity, accuracy, and technical reproducibility remain.

While RNA-seq is a powerful hypothesis-free global sampling tool
for single cell experiments, directed approaches for validation and
absolute quantitation of individual gene targets in single cells are
lacking. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) has been the
gold standard, but the small amount of single cell material limits
measurements across multiple genes. To overcome, a “pre-amplification”
step is frequently performed where several genes are first coamplified
by multiplex PCR to generate adequate material for downstream qPCR
analysis of individual genes. Unfortunately, preamplification introduces
unpredictable bias in the relative amplitude of different genes, prohibiting
absolute quantitation of the original mRNAs.9,10

To ascertain more precisely gene abundance levels, we have developed
a molecular indexing (MI) approach for sensitive quantitation of mRNAs
across multiple genes in single cells. Individual mRNA molecules are
labeled at random from a pool of 960 sequence barcoded oligo-dT primers
during RT, after which gene(s) of interest are amplified by PCR (Figure 1A). When tested on control poly-A RNA templates,
the cDNA synthesis yields using these barcode-tailed oligo-dT primers
are indistinguishable from standard oligo-dT primers. For detection,
a dye labeled primer is used for PCR (Figure 1B) and barcodes are identified by fluorescence imaging after hybridization
to a printed array of complementary probes (Figure 1C–E). For each starting molecule, PCR generates nanomolar
concentrations of amplified DNA per barcode, which is approximately
100–1000× higher than the detection sensitivity of array
hybridization. Alternatively, barcodes can be detected by sequencing.
Although different genes amplify to variable degrees, the number of
distinct barcodes present is largely unaffected. Counting the different
barcodes reveals the absolute transcript copies (Figure 1F).11

Figure 1 Transcript counting using
MI. (A) mRNAs are labeled using barcoded
oligo-dT primers. cDNAs of interest are amplified with gene-specific
and universal PCR primers (B). Dye labeled products generated by nested
PCR are hybridized to a barcode detector and imaged (E) and counted
(F) on a custom-built fluorescent CCD instrument. (C) Perspective

emission bandpass filter (2), camera lens (3), CCD (4), plano-convex
lenses (5), excitation bandpass filter (6), rectangular aperture (7),
aspheric lens (8), LED (9), and barcode detector (10).

Accurate quantitation by MI was established using
serial dilutions
of a synthetic control RNA spiked into a large background of E. coli RNA (Figure 2A), and absolute
copy number measurements closely correlating with input were obtained
(Pearson R-square = 0.9982). GAPDH was measured in
serial dilutions of human liver total RNA and found to be indistinguishable
within the experimental errors to digital PCR (Pearson R-square =
0.9997) (Figure 2B). Primarily designed for
sensitive single cell measurements, the set of 960 barcodes affords
a practical measurement dynamic range of approximately 10 to 4000
copies. However, highly concentrated RNA targets can also be tested
by prediluting to this range prior to measurement.

dilutions of a synthetic spike-in RNA. (B) GAPDH mRNA
measurements in serial dilutions of liver total RNA vs digital PCR.
(C) Technical replicate measurements of GAPDH directly
in single K562 cell lysates. Absolute counts for each half cell volume
are shown. Error bars show 95% measurement confidence intervals.

Next, we tested absolute transcript
quantitation for a set of high,
medium, or low abundance genes in 12.5, 750, or 12 500 pg of
liver total RNA, respectively (Supporting Information, Figure S1A–C). Each gene was measured alone in singleplex
assays and in multiplex format (coamplification of all genes, followed
by individual gene detection). Measurements agreed well between the
two formats, demonstrating that multiple genes may be coassayed without
compromising quantitation accuracy and the ability to obtain absolute
counts.

Technical reproducibility is a key requisite of single
cell analysis.
Significant amplification and manipulation steps are often necessary
when working with limited amounts of cell material, resulting in increased
technical noise that masks detection of small biological variations
among cells. To test MI directly on single cells, we selected individual
K562 cells and lysed them in a PCR tube. The lysate volume was divided
equally into 2 tubes, and GAPDH was measured. GAPDH counts varied from cell to cell as expected,12 but technical replicates from the same cell
were remarkably similar (Figure 2C).

To detect gene expression changes from a biological response, we
induced K562 cells with hemin to increase fetal hemoglobin (HBG2) synthesis.13 The absolute
quantity of GAPDH and HBG2 was measured
for each of 10 induced or untreated cells. A large variation in levels
of HBG2 was observed in untreated cells (336 to 4336
copies, Supporting Information, Figure
S2). Although GAPDH levels also varied, the range
was consistent with cell to cell variation at 456–1328 copies.
After hemin treatment, there was no significant change to the GAPDH expression (176–1536 copies), but large increases
in HBG2 were detected (up to 14 952 copies).
Measured absolute GAPDH counts and HBG2 induction levels agree well with previous reports.14,15

As an alternative to hybridization, we have coupled MI with
sequencing
to test a larger number of genes. To determine accuracy, we performed
standard global RNA-seq analysis16 on 500
ng of a bulk lymphocyte RNA sample and calculated RPKM values from
2.9 × 106 mapped reads. The sample was diluted, and
oligo-dT barcoded cDNA from 10 pg of RNA was used as template for
multiplex PCR of 96 human genes (Supporting Information, Table S1). At this point, individual genes may be tested from the
PCR product by scoring barcodes on the hybridization detector for
one-off measurements or for presequencing QC. We sequenced the PCR
product, and barcodes were counted to determine absolute copy numbers
using 3.99 × 106 mapped reads. The numbers of reads
(Figure 3A) or molecules (Figure 3B) from the 10 pg sample were compared with RPKM values from
the 500 ng bulk sample. To avoid stochastic losses of rare transcripts
from sample dilution, only higher abundance genes (RPKM > 30) were
included for comparison. Although RPKM is a relative measurement subject
to PCR bias, its correlation to the 10 pg sample is significantly
higher for molecules (R-square = 0.7529) than reads (R-square = 0.4566),
demonstrating increased measurement precision and decreased sensitivity
to amplification noise when counting molecules instead of reads.4,11,17−19 In addition,
high quantitation precision for rare transcripts was established by
accurate measurements of small numbers of spike-in control RNAs in
MI assays (Supporting Information, Figure
S3).

Figure 3 Gene expression analysis by MI and sequencing. Ten pg (∼1
cell equivalent) of lymphocyte total RNA was barcoded during RT, and
96 genes were amplified by multiplex PCR and sequenced. Numbers of
mapped reads (A) or molecule counts (B) are compared with RPKM values
from conventional RNA-Seq of 500 ng (∼50 000 cells)
of the same sample (for genes >30 RPKM).

MI and sample indexing can be used together to determine
sensitivity
and reproducibility across a plate of 96 samples. We incorporated
sample barcodes on the oligo-dT primers (Supporting
Information, Figure S4, Table S2) and pipetted into each well
equal amounts of 5 synthetic bacterial control RNAs mixed with single
cell amounts of various human RNAs. After RT, samples were pooled
for multiplex PCR and sequencing. On average, 76.3% of the control
molecules added were detected (Supporting Information, Figure S5), which is 25 to 28 percentage points or about 50% higher
than the detection efficiency reported for TS methods.4,7 The large increase in detection efficiency is not surprising because
gene-specific PCR circumvents losses arising from TS (inefficient
strand-switching or RT not reaching 5′ mRNA ends). Technical
reproducibility (measured by standard deviations, Supporting Information, Figure S5) is about an order of magnitude
better than TS for ∼100 input RNA molecules.2 MI also provided a slightly better coefficient of variation
(23.5%) than RT-qPCR.20

Several single
cell RNA-seq improvements have been described recently.
Smart-seq25 includes modifications to increase
cDNA yields, and high detection efficiencies have been reported in
nanoliter volumes.4,7 In addition, 5 random base barcodes
on the TS oligo were demonstrated as a useful tool to correct PCR
bias and to obtain absolute quantitation.4 Establishing absolute yields and efficiencies for each transcript
in a global approach is a difficult if not unachievable task. It is
therefore very useful to have an independent means to establish absolute
efficiencies and numbers. In the method described here, we use gene-specific
primers for cDNA synthesis to avoid the inefficiencies of TS. In our
hands, TS efficiency measurements with barcoded synthetic RNAs showed
that of the cDNAs synthesized by RT, only ∼14–23% were
strand-switched (Supporting Information, Figures S6 and S7). Furthermore, it has been shown that changes
in amplification conditions significantly alter expression measurements
and create large numbers of artifacts when using TS.5,21 As an independent method, we directly barcode cDNAs using oligo-dT
priming so that truncated cDNAs are still detectable (in contrast,
TS requires full-length cDNA synthesis). Finally, we have employed
well selected 21 nucleotide molecular barcodes that are unambiguous
in sequencing, which can also be counted by hybridization.

The
use of both global RNA-seq and gene-targeted methods can be
an effective way to interrogate single cells. Global RNA-seq provides
a whole transcriptome view but at lower sensitivity and accuracy,
and oversampling of high abundance genes can obscure detection of
rare transcripts. Gene targeting provides efficient focus of sequencing
bandwidth on desired transcripts, including those that are rare, and
enables absolute quantitation with the highest sensitivity and accuracy
when combined with MI. Future improvements are directed at optimizations
to further improve RT yields (for example, by elevating reaction temperature
to reduce secondary structure) and at increasing multiplexing to hundreds
or thousands of genes, with sample indexing for more cells.
