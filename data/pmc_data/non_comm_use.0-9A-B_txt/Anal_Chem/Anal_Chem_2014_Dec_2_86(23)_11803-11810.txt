Eliciting
a cellular response to a changing chemical microenvironment
is central to many biological processes including gene expression,
cell migration, differentiation, apoptosis, and intercellular signaling.
The nature and scope of the response is highly dependent upon the
spatiotemporal characteristics of the stimulus. To date, studies that
investigate this phenomenon have been limited to digital (or step)
chemical stimulation with little control over the temporal counterparts.
Here, we demonstrate an acoustofluidic (i.e., fusion of acoustics
and microfluidics) approach for generating programmable chemical waveforms
that permits continuous modulation of the signal characteristics including
the amplitude (i.e., sample concentration), shape, frequency, and
duty cycle, with frequencies reaching up to 30 Hz. Furthermore, we
show fast switching between multiple distinct stimuli, wherein the
waveform of each stimulus is independently controlled. Using our device,
we characterized the frequency-dependent activation and internalization
of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR), a prototypic G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), using epinephrine.
The acoustofluidic-based programmable chemical waveform generation
and switching method presented herein is expected to be a powerful
tool for the investigation and characterization of the kinetics and
other dynamic properties of many biological and biochemical processes.

==== Body
Biochemical cues with identical
chemical compositions can result in varied biological outcomes when
given with different spatiotemporal characteristics.1,2 Emulating the local microenvironment of the cell with high spatial
and temporal fidelity provides researchers with important degrees
of freedom when studying dynamic biological and biomolecular processes.3−9 Microfluidics has been applied to such studies10−12 because it
offers a level of high-precision fluidic control13−15 lacking in
bulk systems. While progress has been made toward the spatial modulation
of chemical stimuli in microfluidics through the generation of spatial
chemical gradients,16−18 temporal modulation has received limited attention.
Techniques for temporal manipulation of chemical stimuli19−26 are usually based on the concept of switching between two or more
liquid inlets,10,22,26,27 analogous to a multiplexer in electronics.
These designs require sophisticated fabrication methods (numerous
external moving parts),26−28 exotic materials,19,20,23 and/or have slow temporal responses
(working frequencies limited to 1 Hz).27 In addition, although digital (i.e., step stimuli) waveforms are
generated conveniently, continuous modulation of the amplitude and/or
frequency (i.e., analog waveforms) has been difficult.29

Here, we demonstrate that a bubble oscillating
in an acoustic field
provides a unique and versatile method to generate arbitrary temporal
chemical waveforms. This work is built upon our previous findings
that acoustically oscillating bubbles can effectively mix fluids in
a microfluidic channel.30−32 Compared with existing micromixers,33−40 our acoustic bubble-based micromixer seems to be more suitable for
chemical waveform and switch generation because it enables fast mixing
time, can be turned on and off instantaneously, and can be spatially
predesigned anywhere within the microfluidic channel (with the advent
of horseshoe structure). In addition, multiple acoustic bubble-based
micromixers can work independently within the microfluidic channel.
Our approach is capable of generating not only digital chemical waveforms
but also analog waveforms (arbitrary stimuli) whose characteristics,
including shape, frequency, amplitude, and duty cycle, can be conveniently
modulated. Furthermore, by trapping multiple bubbles in a single microchannel,
we demonstrate switching between two distinct stimuli, wherein the
waveform of each stimulus can be independently controlled. To demonstrate
the capability of our device to characterize fast biological processes,
we show that the temporal response of epinephrine-induced activation
and subsequent internalization of β2-adrenergic receptor
(β2-AR), a prototypic G-protein coupled receptor
(GPCR), can be monitored in live cells by precisely controlling the
duration of stimulation.

Experiments
Device Fabrication
A single-layer PDMS microchannel
was fabricated using the soft lithography and the mold replica technique.30−32 In short, a silicon mold for the microchannel was patterned in photoresist
(Shipley 1827, MicroChem) and etched with deep reactive ion etching
(DRIE). The mold was then coated with 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl-trichlorosilane
(Sigma-Aldrich) to reduce its surface energy and any subsequent damage
to the PDMS channel during the demolding process. SylgardTM 184 silicone
elastomer base and SylgardTM 184 silicone elastomer curing agent (Dow
Corning) were mixed at a 10:1 weight ratio and cast onto the silicon
mold. The uncured PDMS on the silicon mold was then degassed in a
vacuum chamber for 2 h to remove any air bubbles and later cured at
65 °C for 45 min. After removing the cured PDMS from the mold,
the inlets and the outlets were drilled into the PDMS using a silicon
carbide drill bit (model 220/395, Dremel). The microfluidic channel
was then bonded to a microcover glass, which had been pretreated with
oxygen plasma. A piezoelectric transducer (model no. 273-073, RadioShack)
was then attached to the glass slide adjacent to the channel using
epoxy (Permatex 84101).

Experimental Details
The glass slide,
including the
microfluidic channel and the piezoelectric transducer, was mounted
on a Nikon TE-2000U optical microscope stage. Ink (PAR3001100, Parker)
or food dye (Assorted/NEON, McCormick) was infused into the channel
through a 1 mL syringe (Becton Dickinson) by automated syringe pumps
(KDS Legato 210). Once the bubbles were stably trapped with a smooth
flow, the transducer was connected to a function generator to control
the bubble activation/deactivation via a function generator (HP8116A/Tektronix
AFG 3011). The driving voltages used in the experiments were 8–16
VPP.

Data/Image Acquisition and Analysis
Data acquisition
for the waveform generation
was directly achieved by region of interest (ROI) selection during
the experiment using InVivo (MediaCybernatics) microscopy software,
connected to a CoolSnap HQ2 (Photometrics) CCD camera. The images
in Figure 3 were captured at 1200 fps (to record
the fast dynamics of each stimulus) and later processed through a
home-built Matlab code. The remaining waveform and switching images
were captured by Nikon D3S or Coolsnap CCD cameras. All movies were
captured by a Nikon D3S or Casio EX-F1. Raw movie files were encoded
into a stack of images and further processed using ImageJ software.

Cell Line and Culture
A HEK293 cell line that was stably
transfected with human β2-AR-GFP was established
at Corning Inc. (Corning, NY). Briefly, HEK293 cells were transfected
with pCMV-β2AR-GFP (OriGene, Rockville, MD) using
Lipofectamine LTX Plus Reagent (Invitrogen) in a 6-well cell culture
plate. The cells were treated with 500 μg/mL G418 (Invitrogen)
the next day. After transfection for 7 days, the surviving cells were
diluted to 2–3 cells/well in a 96-well cell culture plate to
allow the growth of clones derived from single cells. Stable clones
with homogeneous expression level of β2AR-GFP were
selected by visualizing the GFP signal under a fluorescence microscope.
The function of the GFP-tagged β2-ARs were confirmed using receptor
internalization and dynamics mass redistribution assay (see also Supporting Information Figure S7). These stable
cell lines were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, l-glutamine, and 500 μg/mL G418. Prior to running the
experiments, cells were trypsinized, and suspended cells were centrifuged
at 800 rpm for 3 min. Cells were resuspended in 200–400 μL
MEM before incubation in microfluidic channels.

Cell Culture
in Microfluidics
Microfluidic channels
were coated with fibronectin (BD Biosciences) (0.1 mg/mL) for 1 h.
Subsequently, the channels were washed by PBS several times. Ten million
cells/mL were suspended in MEM solution and injected into the microfluidic
channel. The cells were allowed to adhere inside the channel by 60–90
min of incubation. The stimulant (epinephrine, 10 μM) and buffer
(culture medium) were injected at 1 μL/min into the channel
via a pump. Different stimuli lengths (duty cycle) are appropriately
controlled by timing the ON and OFF states of the bubble oscillation.
Internalization signals were then observed by fluorescence imaging.

Fluorescence Microscopy of Living Cells
Fluorescent
images were captured using laser scanning confocal microscopy (Olympus
FV300) with a 60× objective (1.49 NA) at room temperature (∼25
°C). Images were capture by FluoView 300 (version 4.3b). Cell
imaging under microfluidics were captured by Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-U
with a 20× objective (0.45 NA) at room temperature (∼25
°C). Images were captured by Nikon imaging software (NIS-Advanced)
connected to a Hammatsu digital camera (C1140).

Results and Discussion
Chemical
Waveform Generator using Acoustically Activated Bubbles
Figure 1a illustrates the schematic diagram
of our acoustofluidic chemical waveform generator. A horseshoe structure
(HSS) (see also Supporting Information Figure
S1) inside a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microfluidic channel
is used to trap a single bubble through surface tension (see Supporting Information Movies 1 and 2); the structure
also helps to determine the size of the bubble. When driven by an
adjacent piezoelectric transducer controlled by an electronic function
generator, the membrane of the trapped bubble oscillates. The maximum
oscillation of the bubble is achieved at its resonance frequency,
which is size-dependent. At the resonance frequency, the second-order
effect of the nonlinearity in the Navier–Stokes equation becomes
prominent, giving rise to a pressure gradient in the fluid that drives
the recirculating flow regions, commonly referred to as acoustic microstreaming,41,42,44−54 depicted
in Figure 1b.

When the trapped bubble is excited, the counter-rotating vortices
resulting from microstreaming disrupt the clean liquid–liquid
interface in a manner that is characteristic of the laminar flow regime
in the microchannel. The vortices drastically enhance the mass transport
along the direction perpendicular to the flow, effectively mixing
the inlet solutions. This is referred to as the ON state. This mixing
process was observed using fast imaging (1200 frames/s) and is shown
in Figure 1c–i and Supporting Information Movie 3. Complete mixing of the fluids
occurred in less than 30 ms. When the acoustic field is turned off,
the mixing stopped, and the characteristic laminar flow returned.
This is referred to as the OFF state. The fast responses of the electric
and acoustic systems allowed us to directly transform electrical signals
into chemical waveforms, effectively implementing all the capacities
of a function generator.

of the experimental
setup (see the Supporting Information for
experimental details). The piezoelectric transducer, which generates
low-intensity acoustic waves, is placed adjacent to the microfluidic
channel on a glass slide. The acoustic waves drive the bubble trapped
in the horseshoe structure (HSS), which is placed at the interface
of the co-flowing liquids. (b) Experimental observation of acoustic
microstreaming and flow recirculation during the bubble oscillation.
(c–i) Mixing of red and blue dyes captured with high-speed
imaging. The region of interest (ROI) for the output waveform was
chosen ∼300 μm downstream of the HSS, in the bottom half
of the channel. The chemical waveforms were determined by the optical
density of the ROI when ink and buffer solutions were used.

Generation of Digital Chemical
Waveforms
To demonstrate
the device’s functionality, we generated a variety of different
chemical waveforms (Figure 2a–d) using a function generator to control the acoustic
excitation (see also Supporting Information Figure
S4). In these experiments, we infused the two inlets with dye
and a buffer solution at identical flow rates (6 μL/min). The
ROI for the output waveform was chosen ∼300 μm downstream
of the HSS (i.e., past the recirculation zone), such that the stress
developed by an oscillating bubble on cells under investigation is
negligible.45 The width of the ROI was
chosen such that it falls within the mixing distance in the buffer
region, whereas the length of ROI was arbitrarily chosen to fit at
least 2–3 adherent cells under investigation. The optical density
of a specified ROI was used to determine the mixing
efficiency and to give a rough estimate of the stimulant concentration,
which was measured in greyscale values (estimated by ImageJ software).
A square waveform was generated by simply switching the transducer
on and off. The frequency (Figure 2a) and duty
cycle (Figure 2b) of the signals were controlled
by appropriately timing the ON and OFF states of the bubble oscillation.
Burst/pulse signals were generated (Figure 2c) by lowering the transducer excitation duration to less than the
complete mixing time (30 ms). We also show that the frequency of the
chemical signal can be modulated without interruption (Figure 2d), with the potential for a continuous frequency
sweep.

red, 50%; and blue, 80%), (c) burst mode, (d) tunable frequency, (e)
flow rate utilized using automated syringe pumps in achieving amplitude
modulation, (f) sine wave (concentration modulation).

Generation of Analog Chemical Waveforms
In Figure 2a–d, we show several chemical
waveforms with
constant maximum and minimum amplitudes (digital waveforms). To generate
analog signals, such as sinusoidal or triangular waveforms, it is
essential to dynamically vary the amplitude of the stimulus (i.e.,
the concentration of the stimulus). This amplitude modulation was
attained by continuously mixing the stimulus and buffer solutions
while changing the relative flow rates of the inlets. The input flow
rates applied to the microfluidic channel was manipulated by a computer-controlled
syringe pump, as shown in Figure 2e. As the
relative flow rates change between two fluids in a microchannel, the
location of their interface shifts along the width of the channel
due to the difference in inlet pressures (see Supporting Information Figure S5). This controllable interface
can be used to vary the proportion of each fluid that is mixed by
the bubble, resulting in a tunable output concentration of the stimulus.
For example, a sine chemical waveform was achieved (Figure 2f). We note, however, that the amplitude modulation
frequency is limited by the slow response (approximately second time-scale)
of the flow pump. To achieve rapid amplitude modulation, independent
of the pump response, we designed a three-inlet channel with a HSS
at the center. The stimulus (ink) was injected in the center at a
fixed flow rate of 1 μL/min, whereas the buffers (water) were
infused through the other inlets at a fixed flow rate of 2.5 μL/min
(Figure 3a). The
trapped bubble was excited close to its resonance frequency, and the
amplitude of oscillation, which scales linearly with the applied voltage,
was tuned by the function generator.43 As
the voltage is increased, the mixing distance, d,
of ink and water increases in a linear fashion. Figure 3b shows the step decrease in the stimulant concentration for
a step increase of the voltage applied to the transducer in the selected
ROI marked in Figure 3a. Note that the voltage
can be tuned using smaller steps to achieve finer amplitude modulation.
The ink concentration decreases because more buffer solution is mixed
for a fixed volume of the stimulant. The change in concentration was
attained almost instantaneously (inset of Figure 3b), which allowed us to tune the desired concentration. This
concept can be readily used for applications that require rapid mixing
and fine temporal control over stimulant concentrations such as single-shot
chemical kinetics studies.55,56

Figure 3 Rapid amplitude (concentration)
modulation. (a) Schematic of the
experimental setup for rapid amplitude modulation. The channel consists
of a single HSS with three inlets and one outlet: inlets 1 and 3 were
infused with a buffer solution (water), and inlet 2 was infused with
stimuli (ink). When the bubble was acoustically activated, ink mixes
with water with a mixing distance, d. (b) Graph shows
dilution of the ink for increasing voltage in the selected ROI marked
in panel a. The inset shows the raw amplitude modulation data, suggesting
rapid modulation (less than 100 ms).

High-Frequency Characterization
The digital frequency
response of our device is intrinsically limited by the mixing capabilities
of the bubble, properties of the fluids (e.g., density and surface
tension), flow velocity, and location of the ROI. To quantify the
high-frequency response of the device, we compared the photointensity
of the ROI during partial mixing (pulse width less than the total
mixing time) to the intensity at complete mixing to obtain a quantitative
measure of the total mixing efficiency. Figure 4 shows the relative intensity, indicative of mixing efficiency, at
increasing pulse width duration for four different flow rates; the
observed response is typical of a low-pass filter, where low frequencies
show distinct chemical signals, but higher frequencies blur into a
continuum. As seen in the inset of Figure 4a,b, the demixing time (i.e., the falling time), which is dependent
on the flow rate, is the rate-limiting factor in the device’s
frequency response. Despite partial mixing, distinct chemical pulses
can be generated at frequencies greater than 30 Hz, more than an order
of magnitude faster than previous microfluidic designs (∼1
Hz).27

the standard deviation from a minimum of five measurements.

Chemical Switching using
Multiple Bubbles
While the
generation of single chemical waveforms is vital to a variety of biochemical
studies, dynamically switching between or concurrently applying different
chemical stimuli can be useful to study more complex dynamic systems,
such as cell signaling pathways57 or cascades
of biochemical reactions.58,59 In principle, these
studies require logic-type control utilizing multiple waveform generators.
Independently mixing multiple waveforms within a single microchannel
requires multiple trapped bubbles with different resonance frequencies
so they may be excited separately. The resonance frequency of a bubble
is governed by its geometry (i.e., radius) and the properties of the
liquid. Assuming a constant liquid medium, we used HSS geometry to
effectively alter the fundamental resonance frequency of the bubbles.
Preventing cross-excitation due to higher-order harmonic modes of
oscillation was the main challenge. We prescreened nine HSS geometries
that varied in width (see Supporting Information
Figures S2 and S6a). To determine the resonance frequency of
each bubble, we swept the excitation frequency from 10 to 60 kHz in
100 Hz increments while visually monitoring the oscillation amplitude
for a distinct peak. The results are shown in Supporting Information Figure S6b.

Figure 5a shows a schematic diagram of the device used for switching
between two different chemical signals. The channel has three inlets
and one outlet: inlets 1 and 3 (peripheral regions) were infused with
different chemical signals (red and blue dyes for demonstration),
and inlet 2 pumped a buffer solution (water) into the central region
that served as our ROI. Distinct HSSs (60 × 90 μm and 110
× 165 μm) were positioned at each liquid–liquid
interface; the corresponding bubbles had resonant frequencies of 29.5
and 14.7 kHz (Figure 5a). Cross-excitation
of the bubbles at the above frequencies was negligible, shown by the
microstreaming bead test captured in Figure 5b. Figure 5c lays out the binary chemical
circuitry: when bubble A was activated at f = 14.7
kHz, only the red dye mixed with the water to fill the ROI (Figure 5d, bottom panel, and Supporting
Information Movie 4). Conversely, when bubble B was activated
at f = 29.5 kHz, only the blue dye mixed with the
water (Figure 5d, top panel, and Supporting Information Movie 5). Switching between
the red and blue dyes was achieved by alternating between the two
excitation frequencies (Figure 5e; see also Supporting Information Movie 6). This direct
conversion of electrical signals into chemical waveforms allows this
device to access all of the previously demonstrated functions of the
waveform generator, including frequency and amplitude modulation.

Movie 6 for further illustration). (e) Graph of experimental
data for switching between red and blue dyes in the selected ROI marked

GPCR Activation and Internalization
To demonstrate the applicability
of our device for studying dynamic biomolecular processes, we characterized
the agonist-directed temporal desensitization of β2-AR and the subsequent receptor internalization induced by epinephrine
binding. GPCRs play an essential role in cellular homeostasis by binding
external stimuli and initiating transduction pathways that lead to
cellular responses. Upon prolonged or repeated exposure to agonists,
GPCRs may become desensitized and internalized in clathrin-coated
pits.60−63 We monitored this process using a stably transfected cell line expressing
GFP-tagged β2-AR. The experimental setup is shown
in Figure 6a, wherein a single trapped bubble
is used to generate a temporally controlled pulse of chemical stimulant,
epinephrine (5 μM), over a culture of human embryonic kidney
(HEK) cells (see the Supporting Information for further experimental details). Without treatment, the GFP fluorescence
is predominantly located at the cell plasma membrane (Figure 6b). Upon continuous treatment with epinephrine for
45 min, GFP-tagged β2-ARs are translocated from the
plasma membrane surface to the cell interior, as indicated by the
decreased fluorescence at the cell boundary and the increase in β2-AR-loaded endosomes (Figure 6b). A
punctate staining pattern within the cytoplasm, arising from endosomes
containing the GFP-tagged β2-AR, was used as the
means to infer whether the applied pulse of epinephrine led to β2-AR activation and internalization. When the stimulant pulse
was applied for a duration of 100 ms, no significant internalization
of β2-ARs was observed, as shown in the time series
of Figure 6c. Even after 45 min, the fluorescently
labeled β2-ARs are largely observed at the membrane
boundary, with no significant increase in labeled endosomes in the
cell interior. Conversely, when the stimulant pulse was applied for
a duration of 5 s, significant internalization of β2-ARs takes place (Figure 6d) with an onset
time of 15 min. This result is significant in that an agonist stimulation
duration as short as 5 s is sufficient to cause receptor internalization.
Epinephrine is an endogenous agonist for the β2-AR
with rapid on and off rates, and its residence time (reciprocal to
the off rate) to the β2-AR is estimated to be less
than 0.2 s.64 However, the agonist-stimulated
β2-AR internalization in HEK cells is dependent on
phosphorylation of the agonist-stimulated receptor by G-protein-coupled
receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) followed by binding of β-arrestins
to the phosphorylated receptor,65,66 and it requires persistent
agonist occupancy.66,67 The GRK-dependent phosphorylation
is the rate-limiting step in the receptor internalization and often
takes several minutes for completion.66,68 Our result
clearly demonstrates the temporal nature of β2-AR
activation and internalization due to epinephrine binding in cells,
a result that would be difficult to demonstrate in cells using conventional
techniques (e.g., single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy). Given
that most signaling events take place with different spatial–temporal
dynamics, our acoustofluidic69−72 system offers a promising tool for controlling and
characterizing the dynamics of biomolecular processes in the native
cellular context.

cell line that was stably transfected with a GFP-tagged β2-AR was cultured inside the microfluidic waveform chip (see

medium) are injected at 1 μL/min into the channel. (b) GPCR

GPCR was observed in the microfluidic chip at a pulse width of 100
ms stimulant (red arrow indicates that the fluorescently labeled GPCRs
remain unchanged at the membrane boundary). (d) Internalization of

width of 5 s of epinephrine (yellow arrow indicates internalization

Conclusions
Chemical waveforms, when compared to constant
chemical signals,
can have markedly different effects on cellular signaling pathways
that receive, transmit, process, and implement directions from chemical
stimuli. With the on-chip waveform generator and switch reported here,
it is possible to study the dynamics of receptor-mediated signaling
and other cellular responses under well-defined chemical microenvironments,
an important step to understand in vivo receptor biology and drug
action. A constant challenge when studying biological phenomenon in
cells is the variability encountered in samples and conditions. The
chemical composition of the medium in which cell cultures are maintained
is, by nature, complex and constantly undergoing change. As a result,
comparisons between replicate samples of cells grown under otherwise
similar experimental conditions can be confounded by batch-to-batch
variations in media composition and environmental conditions.

Using the technology described herein, it is possible to expose
cells within the same culture to different stimuli while maintaining
the temperature, pH, and other growth conditions at precisely the
same values for all components of the system. In this way, rigorous
experimental controls can be carried out alongside the measurements
of interest with certainty that all samples will experience the same
conditions. This method also provides a powerful tool for the study
of signal transmission and intercellular communication. By carefully
controlling the shape of the chemical waveform administered to a sample,
a subset of the population can be treated with a stimulant while the
remainder of the population is left untreated. This enables the in
situ investigation of signal transmission or communication without
the need to physically isolate or manipulate the cells. Another significant
benefit of this technology is the ability to temporally control the
chemical waveforms generated. This makes possible the measurement
of biological phenomena that span a broad range of time scales and
enables the measurement of the kinetics of these processes. Applications
where these features are of particular use include the investigation
of fast cellular signaling events and the characterization of pharmacokinetics
at the single-cell level.73 Finally, generating
waveforms in continuous flow also eliminates the abrupt changes in
shear stress at the cell membrane that occur in segmented flow devices,
more closely mimicking in vivo chemical signals. The capability of
this device to generate temporally controlled analog waveforms in
controlled environments is expected to be of significant benefit to
those studying myriad cellular phenomena and is sure to find applications
in the investigation and characterization of intercellular signaling,
cancer metastasis, immunochemistry, stem cell differentiation, and
many other cellular events that require precise spatial and temporal
control over local chemical environments.
