Sensitive
and specific detection of pathogens via nucleic acid
amplification is currently constrained to laboratory settings and
portable equipment with costly fluorescent detectors. Nucleic acid-detecting
lateral flow immunoassay strips (LFIAs) offer a low-cost visual transduction
strategy at points of need. Unfortunately, these LFIAs frequently
detect amplification byproducts that can yield spurious results which
can only be deciphered through statistical analysis. We integrated
customizable strand displacement probes into standard loop mediated
isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays to prevent byproduct capture
on commercial LFIAs. We find that combining strand displacement with
LAMP (SD-LAMP) yields LFIA test band intensities that can be unequivocally
interpreted by human subjects without additional instrumentation,
thereby alleviating the need for a portable reader’s analysis.
Using SD-LAMP, we capture target amplicons on commercially available
LFIAs from as few as 3.5 Vibrio cholerae and 2 750 Escherichia coli bacteria without false positive or false
negative interpretation. Moreover, we demonstrate that LFIA capture
of SD-LAMP products remain specific even in the presence of complex
sample matrixes, providing a significant step toward reliable instrument-free
pathogen detection outside of laboratories.

Isothermal
nucleic acid amplification
techniques, such as loop mediated amplification (LAMP), are promising
methods for point-of-need pathogen identification because they can
efficiently amplify targets without the expensive thermal cycling
equipment of conventional PCR.1−3 LAMP can amplify 10 ng of nucleic
acids within 5–10 min4 and from
complex patient,5,6 environmental,7 and food sample matrixes.8 Despite
the minimal infrastructure required to amplify a pathogenic gene target
via LAMP, additional instrumentation is typically required to both
sensitively and specifically visualize amplicons which limits the
usage of LAMP outside of a laboratory.

Minimal instrumentation
techniques frequently reported for LAMP
amplicon visualization, such as intercalating fluorophores, detecting
pyrophosphate byproducts,2,9,10 and staining with crystal violet dye11 or pH-sensitive dyes12 all nonspecifically
transduce signals from both off-target and target amplicons. Similarly
problematic, previously published methods demonstrate amplicon detection
by labeling primers for capture on a low-cost lateral flow immunoassay
(LFIA), risking capture of primer dimers and spurious amplicons.13−15 The false positive results endemic to these nonspecific signal transduction
methods are typically mitigated by redesigning the primer sets or
reducing reaction time, which also decreases assay sensitivity. Alternatively,
target specific detection of LAMP amplicons can be achieved with hybridization
of incorporated primers,16 polymerase-mediated
strand displacement of duplexed primers,17 or toehold-mediated strand displacement events,18 but all have required an excited fluorophore and fluorescent
reader for signal transduction. Du et al. have recently alleviated
the need for a lab-based fluorescent reader by coupling target-specific
strand exchange reactions to a home-pregnancy test, an inexpensive
and ubiquitous lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) strip, for visual detection.19 However, multiple additional user steps and
reagents to complete this signal transduction complicated the detection
and could increase interpretation error. In this work, we leverage
the specificity of a strand displacement probe to tag amplified nucleic
acids in a one-pot reaction mixture. This probe allows direct capture
of the reaction products on a commercial LFIA for visual detection.

To demonstrate specific detection of LAMP amplicons, we integrated
tagged strand displacement probes into LAMP assays (which we subsequently
call SD-LAMP) for the detection of Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae (Figure 1) in human and environmental sample matrixes.
A Mastermix of LAMP reagents, strand displacement probes, and bacteria
were isothermally heated to simultaneously lyse bacteria and amplify
and tag the target DNA. After an hour of heating, reaction products
were deposited onto a commercial LFIA which yield colorimetric bands
within 30 min to indicate the presence or absence of target DNA. We
further evaluated the unaided reading of LFIA results by human subjects,
determining LFIA test band intensities required for definitive interpretation.
We demonstrated that while LAAMP assays themselves were specific,
the LFIA readout of conventional LAMP assays without strand displacement
probes yielded results that were difficult to interpret by untrained
and even trained users. Rather than redesign the entire primer sets,
we found the use of strand displacement probes greatly improved interpretability
of LFIAs by increasing the intensity of positive test bands and preventing
primer dimerization that yielded false positive test bands. Moreover,
the modified amplification and detection assays performed robustly
even when diluted in complex matrixes such as pond water and human
blood plasma.

Experimental Section
Bacterial Cell Culture
E.
coli strain
DH5α (NEB, Ipswich, MA) and V. cholerae strain
N16961 (generously donated by Dr. Afsar Ali at the University of Florida)
were grown overnight at 37 °C at 350 rpm (Thermo Fisher, Waltham,
MA) in lysogeny broth (LB) media. Cultures were diluted in LB media
to an OD600 (Ultrospec 10, Biochrom, Cambourne, U.K.) of 1.0, representing
5.5 × 109 cells/mL of E. coli or
7.0 × 109 cells/mL of V. cholerae as determined by fluorescence microscopy of serially diluted cells
or counting colony forming units of serially diluted cells, respectively.

Reagents
Oligonucleotide primers and probes were ordered
from Integrated DNA Technology (IDT, Coralville, IA) and are summarized
in Table S-2. Oligonucleotides were resuspended
in DNase/RNase-free DI water. Note that LF and LB primers are tagged
with either 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) or biotin for capture on commercial
lateral flow immunoassay strips. Local pond water was collected and
then stored at 4 °C until use. Citrated human whole-blood (catalog
no. IPLA-WB1, Innovative Research, Novi, MI) was separated into plasma
by centrifugation at 1 000g for 10 min at
4 °C (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5424R, Hamburg, Germany). Whole blood
was stored at 4 °C and used within 2 weeks; plasma was stored
at −20 °C until use.

Standard LAMP Reaction
of E. coli
In total, 5 μL of E. coli culture diluted
in LB media, pond water, or plasma was added to 20 μL reaction
mixtures containing 0.3 μM each F3 and B3 primers, 2.4 μM
each FIP and BIP primers, 1.2 μM each LF and LB primers, 1100
mM betaine, 1.4 mM dNTPs, 1× Isothermal Buffer, and 8U Bst 2.0
polymerase. Reactions were incubated at 65 °C for 1 h followed
by a 1 min 95 °C denaturing step to prevent further amplification
(7500 RT-PCR System, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and then
kept at 4 °C until analyzed.

Standard LAMP Reaction
of V. cholerae
In total, 5 μL of V. cholerae culture diluted
in LB media or pond water was added to 20 μL reaction mixtures
containing 0.2 μM each F3 and B3 primers, 1.6 μM each
FIP, BIP, LF, and LB primers, 800 mM betaine, 1.4 mM dNTPs, 1×
Isothermal Buffer, and 8U Bst 2.0 polymerase. Reactions were incubated
at 65 °C for 1 h followed by a 1 min 95 °C denaturing step
to prevent further amplification using the 7500 RT-PCR System (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and then kept at 4 °C until analyzed.

SD-LAMP Probe Design
Strand displacement probes were
designed to bind to the forward loop region of the malB and ctxA gene targets following previously published
design considerations,18 in order to detect
only the target amplification products (Table S-2). We aimed for a free energy change of −18 kcal/mol
at the probes’ duplex region, which constrained both probes’
binding sites to the location of the forward loop primers. Probes
were tagged with 6-FAM and preannealed to shorter complementary strands
tagged with a quencher for real-time amplification verification (data
not shown). All 3′-OH groups were blocked against polymerization
by including a 3′ inverted dT group. The short, single stranded
regions in the FAM-labeled probe strands were designed to act as a
toehold to initiate strand displacement (Figure 1A) and bind to the amplicon target. The tagged
amplicon can then be visualized on an LFIA (Figure 1B).

SD-LAMP Reaction of E. coli
A stock
solution of strand displacement probe was prepared by annealing 1
μM of FAM tagged oligonucleotide to 5 μM of quencher tagged
oligonucleotide in Isothermal Buffer at 95 °C for 1 min followed
by 0.1 °C/s cooling to room temperature. In total, 5 μL
of E. coli culture diluted in LB media, pond water,
or plasma and 1.25 μL of prepared probe was added to 18.75 μL
reaction mixtures containing 0.3 μM each F3 and B3 primers,
2.4 μM each FIP and BIP primers, 1.2 μM LB primers, 1100
mM betaine, 1.4 mM dNTPs, 1× Isothermal Buffer, and 8U Bst 2.0
polymerase. Reactions were incubated at 65 °C for 1 h followed
by a 1 min 95 °C denaturing step kept at 4 °C until analysis
to prevent further amplification.

SD-LAMP Reaction of V. cholerae
A
stock solution of probe was prepared by annealing 1 μM of FAM
tagged oligonucleotide to 5 μM of quencher tagged oligonucleotide
in Isothermal Buffer at 95 °C for 1 min followed by 0.1 °C/s
cooling to room temperature. In total, 5 μL of V. cholerae culture diluted in LB media or pond water and 2.5 μL of prepared
probe was added to 17.5 μL reaction mixtures containing 0.2
μM each F3 and B3 primers, 1.6 μM each FIP, BIP, and LB
primers, 800 mM betaine, 1.4 mM dNTPs, 1× Isothermal Buffer,
and 8U Bst 2.0 polymerase. Reactions were incubated at 65 °C
for 1 h followed by a 1 min 95 °C denaturing step to prevent
further amplification and then kept at 4 °C until analyzed.

Gel Electrophoresis Characterization and LFIA Detection
In total, 10 μL of reaction mixtures were loaded with an additional
2 μL of 6× Purple Loading Dye (NEB, Ipswich, MA) into a
2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and were run at 100–115
V for 45 min. A total of 10 μL of FastDNA ladder was used as
a size standard. The resulting gels were imaged with a 15 s exposure
(c400, Azure Biosystems, Dublin, CA). In total, 10 μL of reaction
mixtures were mixed with 40 μL of commercial LFIA wash buffer
and pipetted onto a fluorescein capturing lateral flow immunoassay
(catalog no. D003-03, USTAR Biotechnologies, Hangzhou, China). The
FAM and biotin tagged nucleic acid amplification products are expected
to complex with the streptavidin-conjugated nanoparticles present
in the LFIA’s conjugate pad. This complex flows downstream
to the test lines where it will be captured by immobilized antifluorescein
antibodies. Remaining streptavidin-conjugated nanoparticles will be
captured by immobilized antistreptavidin antibodies. The accumulation
of visible nanoparticles at the test and control lines will therefore
indicate a positive (2 lines) or negative (1 line) result.

Statistical
Analysis and Quantification
All strips
were scanned at least 30 min after initial sample application on an
Epson V850 Pro scanner (Long Beach, CA) to allow tests to dry. Test
band intensities were analyzed with a custom MATLAB script that averages
the gray scale pixel intensity (to maximize signal-to-noise) and subtracts
out average background signal 25 pixels below the test band. The resultant
“background subtracted test line intensity” was then
calculated as  where
0 represents the lowest possible pixel
intensity (i.e., black). Computationally, this yields a much greater
dynamic range than physically possible given the saturation limitation
of nanoparticles.20 To determine the limit
of detection of E. coli and V. cholerae, 4 test strip replicates from each solution’s starting dilution
were analyzed for statistical significance (Figures S1–S3 and S5 contain the replicate gels and LFIA strips).
The test band intensities were compared to the averaged LFIA experimental
negative control test band intensities using a Dunnett’s test
with an alpha set to 0.05.

Human Interpretation of LFIA Test Bands
To determine
LFIA test bands’ visible threshold for positive interpretation
(independent of experimental negative control test band intensities),
18 volunteers between the ages of 18 and 44 years of age with no self-described
vision impairments were asked to evaluate 10 test strips of varying
test band intensities (Figure 3), three times each and in varying lighting conditions (indoors,
outdoors in sun, and outdoors in shade, amounting to 54 distinct observations).
The evaluation study was performed in accordance to Purdue University’s
Human Research Protection Program. We performed a two-way ANOVA to
evaluate confounding effects of test strip or and lighting conditions
on test strip order. A Fisher’s Exact Test was used to determine
whether previous instruction on reading LFIAs (e.g., in a classroom
or previous research setting) affected volunteers’ interpretation.

Results and Discussion
Detection of Standard LAMP Amplicons on LFIAs
Our initial
attempt to capture labeled LAMP amplicons on LFIA strips followed
previously published methods for detection of other LAMP amplicon
targets using labeled primers but yielded both true positives that
had only faint positive test bands as well as false positive results.
We tagged the loop primers (forward loop primer with FAM; backward
loop primer with biotin) of previously reported LAMP primers designed
to amplify the malB gene of E. coli (Table S-1).21 We heated the amplification reactions with serial dilutions of E. coli to simultaneously lyse the bacteria and amplify
its DNA. After 1 h of heating, we verified amplification by observing
a characteristic ladder-like banding pattern in electrophoresis gels
and deposited the reaction products onto LFIA strips. After 30 min,
we expected to observe a pink test band, indicating a direct sandwich
of the tagged amplicons between streptavidin coated gold nanoparticles
and immobilized antifluorescein antibody at the LFIA’s test
line (Figure 1B). However,
despite observing abundant amplification products by gel electrophoresis
from reactions with as few as 275 E. coli cells,
we observed only faintly positive test bands in the corresponding
LFIA strips (Figure 2A). Only by quantitatively measuring the test band intensity of scanned
strips and performing a Dunnett’s multicomparison test were
we able to discern positive test bands of reactions with 275 E. coli cells from negative control reactions. Reliance
on a computer algorithm to interpret the LFIAs would greatly limit
their utility at points of need outside of a laboratory. Therefore,
we sought to improve the assay results for instrument-free interpretation.

Human Subjects’ Visual Interpretation of LFIAs
To
inform assay design specifications that would permit human interpretable
LFIAs, we studied 18 human subjects’ visual interpretation
of LFIA strips. Half of the participants reported having previous
instruction on how to read a lateral flow test (e.g., in a classroom
or research setting) and the other half of participants reported having
no previous instruction. All participants evaluated test strips and
recorded whether they interpreted the LFIA to be positive, negative,
or invalid when referencing a provided schematic (Figure S-9). A two-way ANOVA test confirmed that neither the
order of test strip presentation nor the lighting conditions had confounding
effects on test result interpretation. Test strips with a background-subtracted
test band intensity above 0.020 were interpreted as positive more
than 98% of the time by participants with and without previous instruction.
However, just over half of participants repeatedly interpreted the
next faintest test band (strip 4 in Figure 3 with a 0.013 background-subtracted
intensity) as negative (Figure S-8), suggesting
that there was a different visible threshold for a portion of participants.
By using a Fisher’s exact test to evaluate the effect of participants’
previous instruction on their interpretation of test strip 4, we determined
that users with prior instruction more frequently interpret this strip
as positive while those without prior instruction interpreted the
strip as negative (Table 1). For maximum usability by both trained and untrained LFIA
readers, we therefore aimed for LFIAs to have a test band intensity
of at least 0.020 for positive interpretation and well below 0.013
for negative interpretation.

Figure 3 A total of 98 percent of test strips with a
background subtracted
test intensity of 0.020 are interpreted as positive by unaided human
subjects.

Noting that all of the LFIA test bands resulting
from conventional E. coli LAMP reaction product capture
were at, or below,
the visible threshold of 0.020, we aimed to improve positive test
band intensity. We hypothesized that steric hindrance had prevented
efficient capture of the amplicons using LF-FAM and LB-biotin primers
and therefore repeated the amplification reactions with LF-biotin
and LB-FAM primers (Figure 2B). The swapped primer tag configuration still yielded a limit
of detection in agarose gels of 275 E. coli cells
but resulted in positive test bands in all LFIAs, including negative
controls. Not only were true positive LFIAs indistinguishable from
negative control LFIAs by computer analysis, but all LFIAs would be
interpreted positive by the human eye. We observed similar nonspecific
capture of reaction products when performing a standard LAMP amplification
of the V. cholerae ctxA gene using labeled primers
(Figure 4A, Table S-1).22

Modification of LAMP with Strand Displacement
Probe
Suspecting that the false positive LFIA results were
caused by LB
and LF primer hybridization, as observed by other researchers,18 we decided to replace the LF primer with a strand
displacement probe tagged with FAM and perform SD-LAMP. The probe
binds to the targeted loop region of the LAMP products by toehold-mediated
strand exchange, a process that has been demonstrated to be exquisitely
sequence specific due to the thermodynamic penalties of initiating
branch migration.23 Even single nucleotide
mismatches prevent strand displacement of the probe. Since the probe
does not prime amplification and spurious amplification products caused
by LAMP primers’ hybridization lack the probes’ binding
site, the probe is expected to hybridize with only true target amplification
products. Therefore, no spurious SD-LAMP products are expected to
contain both the biotin and FAM labels that facilitate capture on
LFIAs and could otherwise cause false positive results. As expected,
SD-LAMP reaction products from both E. coli and V. cholerae were deposited on LFIAs and yielded no false
positive test bands. As seen in Figure 2C, positive test bands from as few as 2 750 E. coli cells are well above the visible threshold intensity.
Moreover, LFIAs from negative control reactions display as true negatives.
The order of magnitude decrease in sensitivity compared to the conventional
LAMP reaction is likely a result of there being only 1 loop primer
instead of the usual 2 that accelerate amplification.24 In the V. cholerae LFIAs (Figure 4B), we did not observe a decrease
in sensitivity and consistently visualized SD-LAMP product from as
few as 350 cells (and several times as few as 3.5 V. cholera
cells), likely because the primers bound more efficiently
than the malB primers. However, as with SD-LAMP E. coli products, we observed only intense true positive
LFIA test bands and no bands from true negative SD-LAMP V.
cholerae products. Notably, the test band intensity (or lack
thereof) resulting from SD-LAMP negative control reactions are narrowly
distributed and well below the 0.013 threshold indicating that they
can be easily interpreted as negative. Conversely, the test band intensities
of negative control reactions using labeled primers were broadly distributed
which caused user confusion during interpretation. Adding the strand
displacement probes to the LAMP protocol is a simpler modification
than redesigning primer sets or painstakingly optimizing reaction
times. This essential modification mitigates spurious amplification
and nonspecific detection in easy-to-use LFIAs, improving LAMP’s
utility outside of a laboratory.

SD-LAMP of Complex Sample
Matrixes
Both enteric pathogenic V. cholerae and E. coli have been found
in environmental water sources and are significant public health concerns.25,26 Furthermore, E. coli is a common cause of sepsis
by infecting the bloodstream of neonates and others with impaired
immune systems.27 The rapid, sensitive,
and accurate detection of these pathogenic bacteria from complex matrixes
such as pond water and blood would aid in the control of waterborne
and bloodborne infectious diseases. Given that complex matrixes have
been found to inhibit amplification assays such as PCR, we investigated
whether pond water or human blood would similarly limit the utility
of SD-LAMP visualization on LFIAs (Figure 5). We found LFIAs yielded positive test bands
from SD-LAMP reactions performed with 50% pond water (the maximum
possible ratio given that the reagents are prehydrated) and as few
as 27 500 E. coli and 350 V. cholerae cells. LFIAs yielded positive test bands from SD-LAMP reactions
performed with 10% human blood plasma and as few as 27 500 E. coli cells. The decrease in sensitivity caused by pond
water and blood plasma is a result of a decrease in LAMP reaction
efficiency in these matrixes (as seen in Figure S-4 and also previously reported).28 Because the LFIA results match the agarose gel outputs, we can confirm
that these are not due to a decrease in the hybridization efficiency
of the strand displacement probes or capture efficiency of the LFIAs.
The positive test bands remained well above the 0.02 visible threshold
intensity and the negative test bands remained well below the 0.013
threshold. Our combined SD-LAMP and LFIA assay detects E.
coli 100 times more sensitively than commercially available
LFIA tests29 that rely on surface antigen
capture. Moreover, our combined SD-LAMP and LFIA assay can detect
1000 fewer V. cholerae cells than existing commercial
dipstick tests (taking into account that the existing dipstick assay
requires 200 μL of sample while SD-LAMP is a 25 μL reaction).30

Until now, the utility of LAMP isothermal amplification
outside
of a laboratory has been restricted by the lack of signal transduction
that is easy-to-use, low-cost, and specific. Strand displacement probes
are a simple improvement to LAMP and provide instrument-free nucleic
acid detection on low-cost LFIAs without requiring additional user
steps. Future research will explore the combination of strand displacement
probes with other isothermal amplification assays for instrument-free
detection.
