It is well-known that the uptake
of single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWNTs) by living cells depends on factors such as SWNT length and
surface chemistry. Surprisingly, little is known about whether the
electronic structure of a SWNT influences uptake. One reason for this
has been the lack of methods to measure the uptake of SWNTs by cell
populations. Previously, we developed a rapid, sensitive, and label-free
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)
method for measuring the amount of SWNTs in lysates prepared from
cultured cells (Wang et al. Anal. Chem. 2009 , 81 , 2944 19296592 ). Herein, we describe the use of SDS-PAGE
and microprobe Raman spectroscopy to detect and distinguish the electronic
structure of SWNTs internalized by mammalian cells. Using normal rat
kidney (NRK) cells and SWNTs dispersed with bovine serum albumin (BSA),
we demonstrate that the method can detect both metallic and semiconducting
SWNTs in lysates of cells that had internalized BSA-SWNTs and that
the uptake of BSA-SWNTs by NRK cells is not influenced by SWNT electronic
structure.

==== Body
The specific
chemical and structural
features of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that may influence their mechanism
or rate of uptake by mammalian cells is not well understood.1,2 For example, two mechanisms have been presented to describe how
CNTs enter cells. The first is based on reports that both single-walled
CNTs (SWNTs) and multiwalled CNTs (MWNTs) penetrate membranes to appear
within the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm of cells.3−6 Alternatively, there are numerous
reports that CNTs enter cells by endocytosis and are found within
endosomes and lysosomes of the vacuolar system, segregated from the
cytoplasm by a membrane barrier.7−13 There is also evidence that length affects the uptake of CNTs by
cells. For example, studies using DNA-coated CNTs or Pluronic F-127
polymer-coated CNTs have shown that shorter CNTs (≤400 nm)
are more readily internalized by mammalian cells.1,14,15

One physiochemical property of SWNTs
that has not been thoroughly
investigated with respect to its influence on cellular uptake is electronic
structure. The structural unit of a SWNT is a graphene sheet of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms rolled into a cylinder, and each
SWNT with a unique diameter and chiral angle is distinguished by two
rollup vector integers, n and m.
Except for very small diameter tubes, SWNT structures for which n–m is evenly divisible by 3 are
semimetallic, those for which n = m are metallic, and all others are semiconducting with a band gap
that is inversely dependent on the tube diameter.16 An interesting question is, therefore, whether SWNTs with
different electronic structures, and consequently different configurations
of carbon atoms on their surfaces, affect their uptake by mammalian
cells.

There are several scenarios whereby the electronic structure
of
a SWNT could influence the uptake process. All start with the foundation
that hydrophobic SWNTs are stabilized in water by means of covalent
and/or noncovalent functionalization with a dispersant and that uptake
is preceded by an interaction with the cell membrane. The first scenario
is based on well-known observations that coating SWNTs with certain
small-molecule or macromolecular dispersants can encapsulate SWNTs
as a function of their electronic structure.17 It is, therefore, plausible that the electronic structure of exposed
SWNT regions could influence how a protein dispersant binds, thereby
influencing the protein’s secondary structure,18 which in turn could influence how the protein-coated SWNT
interacts with various plasma membrane domains.19 A second scenario is based on evidence that exposed portions
of SWNT sidewalls can trigger nonspecific endocytosis by interaction
with hydrophobic domains on the plasma membrane.20,21 This scenario is supported further by scanning probe microscopy
studies of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated SWNTs showing that exposed
hydrophobic regions of SWNT sidewalls can extend for several tens
of nanometers,20 and pulsed-field gradient
NMR studies showing that commonly used pluronic polymer- and albumin
protein-dispersants have short-lived (≤50 ms) residence times
on SWNT surfaces.22,23 It is, therefore, plausible that
the surface of any covalently or noncovalently functionalized SWNT
may not be completely covered by dispersant at any given time, and
thus, the electronic structure of a SWNT could influence how it interacts
with a cell membrane through transiently exposed hydrophobic surface
regions, even in the presence of dispersants.

Progress in understanding
the physiochemical properties of SWNTs
that influence their cellular uptake is also hampered by the difficulty
in detecting cell-associated SWNTs (i.e., SWNTs bound to and/or internalized
by cells) from a population of cells. This not the case for nanoparticles
comprising or containing metals since their cell-associated levels
can be easily detected above the high background of carbon in a biological
matrix using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICPMS).
In contrast, the most common methods to detect cell-associated SWNTs,
namely, electron, ultraviolet/visible fluorescence, near-infrared
photoluminescence, and Raman microscopies, are all high spatial resolution
techniques whose use is impractical in generating an average measure
of cell populations for statistical analysis of experimental variability.24 In response to this analytical challenge, we
previously developed a rapid, sensitive, and label-free sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) method for
measuring the amount of SWNT material in lysate samples prepared from
a large number of cultured cells;25 and
recently, we demonstrated the usefulness of the method in guiding
the accurate assessment of a comparative SWNT cytotoxicity analysis.12

Herein, we demonstrate the use of SDS-PAGE
and microprobe Raman
spectroscopy to assess whether the electronic structure of a SWNT
influences the cell uptake process. Using normal rat kidney (NRK)
cells and SWNTs dispersed with bovine serum albumin (BSA), we first
demonstrate that the SDS-PAGE/Raman method can detect and distinguish
metallic and semiconducting SWNTs present in dispersed BSA-SWNT samples
and lysate samples of cells that had taken-up SWNTs. Next, we demonstrate
that the ratio of the most abundant metallic and semiconducting SWNT
structures identified in the Raman spectra of lysate samples of SWNT-treated
cells is identical to the ratio observed for the BSA-SWNT dispersions
applied to cells, suggesting that the electronic structure of SWNTs
coated with BSA does not influence SWNT uptake by NRK cells.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals and Solutions
Raw HiPco SWNT powder (lot
no. R0559; ∼75 w % carbonaceous and ∼22 w % metallic
species as determined by TGA) was purchased from Unidym Inc.; caution,
a particulates respirator should be worn when handling dry SWNT powders.
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) was purchased from
Irvine Scientific and was supplemented with 37 mg/mL sodium bicarbonate,
4.5 mg/mL d-glucose, 0.29 mg/mL l-glutamine, 10
mM HEPES, 15 mg/L phenol red, 100 units/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin,
and 2.5 μg/mL amphotericin B. DMEM further supplemented with
5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone) is denoted DMEM/FBS. Phosphate
buffered saline (PBS; 8 mM phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) was sterilized
by autoclaving at 120 °C for 0.5 h. Deionized water (18.2 MΩ
cm) was obtained using a Barnstead Nanopure Infinity water purification
system. BSA solutions were prepared by dissolving 10 g of BSA in 100
mL of sterile deionized water, adjusting the pH to 7.4, and filtering
the solution through a 0.22-μm pore membrane. All other chemicals
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise noted.

Preparation
of BSA-SWNT Dispersions
A sonication/centrifugation
protocol was used to process dry SWNT powders into aqueous BSA-SWNT
dispersions. Specifically, 1.0 mg of HiPco SWNT powder was mixed with
1.0 mL of BSA solution in a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube and then probe sonicated
at 0 °C. Probe sonication was performed using a Branson 250 Sonifier
operated at 10 W with the ice-cooled, 3-mm diameter probe tip centered
5 mm from the bottom of the tube. After 10 min of sonication, the
resulting black suspension was centrifuged in an Eppendorf 5424 centrifuge
for 8 min at 21 000g. The upper ∼900
μL of the supernatant was recovered without disturbing the sediment
and placed in a clean microcentrifuge tube before a second 8-min centrifugation
at 21 000g was performed. The upper ∼850
μL of the second supernatant was recovered, and this process
was repeated with 21 000g centrifugation with
times of 16 and 42 min to yield a third and fourth supernatant, respectively.
BSA-SWNT dispersions could be stored at 4 °C for at least 1 month
without any SWNTs precipitating out of solution.

Characterization
of BSA-SWNT Dispersions
The amount
of HiPco-SWNT material (i.e., SWNTs and related carbonaceous species)
in BSA-SWNT dispersions was ∼75 μg/mL as determined using
the SDS-PAGE method.12,25 In brief, 1.0 mg of as-received
HiPco powder was sonicated in 1.0 mL of 100 mg/mL BSA solution to
generate a standard dispersion that did not involve selective removal
of material by centrifugation. The standard dispersion was loaded
in increasing volumes in separate lanes and electrophoresed at 100
V for 2 h. Following electrophoresis, a digitized gel image was acquired
and a calibration curve was constructed using the quantified pixel
intensities of the SWNT-containing bands that were corrected by the
weight percentage of carbon species (75%) in the powder. The pixel
intensity acquired from a gel band of a known volume of a BSA-SWNT
dispersion loaded in the gel was then used to estimate the amount
of HiPco-SWNT material in the BSA-SWNT dispersion. Absorption spectra
of BSA-SWNT dispersions were acquired using a dual-beam Perkin-Elmer
Lambda 900 UV–vis-NIR spectrophotometer with a scan speed of
125.00 nm/min and integration times of 0.48 s. All spectra were background
corrected against a sonicated/centrifuged BSA control solution. The
total metals detected in the fourth supernatant (also known as a BSA-SWNT
dispersion) was <2 ppm as determined by ICPMS.25

Cell Culture
Normal rat kidney (NRK)
cells were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection and were cultured in DMEM/FBS
in a 37 °C incubator with 90% air and 10% CO2. To
determine the number of cells in a given dish, the cells were detached
using 0.05% (w/v) trypsin-EDTA. Aliquots of these cell suspensions
were diluted in Isoton-II isotonic solution, and the number of cells
was measured using a Beckman Coulter Z1 particle counter. SWNT uptake
experiments involved inoculating 1 × 106 cells in
100-mm tissue culture dishes in DMEM/FBS. The cells were incubated
at 37 °C for 24 h to allow them to adhere to the bottom of dishes.
After the initial 24-h incubation, the cells were washed twice with
PBS before the addition of either fresh control media, prepared by
mixing 2×-concentrated DMEM/FBS in a 1:1 ratio with water or
experimental media, prepared by mixing 2×-concentrated DMEM/FBS
in a 1:1 ratio with a BSA-SWNT dispersion containing ∼75 μg/mL
of HiPco-SWNT material. This resulted in a concentration of ∼38
μg/mL of HiPco-SWNT material in medium that was added to the
cells, which were then incubated at 37 °C for 3 days.

Extracting
SWNTs from Cells
Following the 3-day incubation,
cells were washed twice with DMEM/FBS and twice with PBS before being
detached from the dish with trypsin. The suspended cells were collected
by gentle centrifugation at 60g for 7 min, resuspended
in PBS to remove traces of trypsin and centrifuged again. Cells in
the pellet were lysed by suspending them in a 200-μL mixture
of 1% SDS, 1 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM CaCl2 for 2
h at 37 °C. The cell lysate were then treated with 20 μg
of DNase I for 2 h at 37 °C to degrade released DNA and reduce
the solution viscosity.

SDS-PAGE of Cell Lysates
SDS-PAGE
of cell lysate samples
was performed using a standard Hoefer Mini Vertical Gel as described
previously by Wang et al.25 Lysate samples
(60 μL prepared from control or SWNT-treated cells) were loaded
in separate lanes and electrophoresed at 100 V for 2 h before each
lane was analyzed by microprobe Raman spectroscopy.

Raman Spectroscopy
All Raman spectra were acquired
using a Horiba Jobin Yvon high-resolution LabRam HR800 Raman spectrometer
with a 450-μm entrance slit and an 1100-μm confocal pinhole.
Wavenumber calibration was performed using the 520.5 cm–1 line of a silicon wafer, and the spectral resolution was ∼5
cm–1. The 632.8-nm laser excitation was provided
by a Spectra-Physics model 127 helium–neon laser operating
at 20 mW. The typical power delivered to the sample was 3 mW as measured
using a Newport model-1815C power meter with an 818UV series photodetector.
Raman spectra of aqueous BSA-SWNT dispersions (500-μL samples
dispensed into 35-mm glass-bottom imaging dishes (MatTek)) were acquired
using a 50×/0.5 NA LM-Plan objective. Raman spectra of SDS-PAGE
bands (obtained by removing ∼4 mm2 of material around
a gel band and placing it flat on an imaging dish) were acquired using
a 100×/0.9 NA M-Plan objective. Raman spectra between 100 and
3000 cm–1 were acquired with 5-s integration times
and were plotted as the average of three spectra, and spectra between
150 and 350 cm–1 were acquired with 10-s integration
times and were plotted as the average of 10 spectra. All peak positions
were obtained by Lorentzian fitting of the corresponding spectral
region as described by Strano et al.26

Results and Discussion
Characterization of BSA-SWNT Dispersions
HiPco SWNTs
were chosen for this work because they characteristically contain
a variety of metallic and semiconducting SWNT structures that are
amenable to resonant Raman spectroscopic analysis using 632.8-nm laser
excitation. The biocompatible dispersant chosen for this work was
BSA, a water-soluble protein well-known to noncovalently coat pristine
SWNTs.10,12,27−30 All BSA-SWNT dispersions were prepared using a sonication and centrifugation
protocol adapted from Smalley and co-workers.31 The first advantage of this protocol is the effective removal of
heavier metal-containing SWNTs and bundles (e.g., >99% of the metals
present in the HiPco SWNT powder were not detected by ICPMS in BSA-SWNT
dispersions).25,32 Another advantage is the facile
production of individually dispersed SWNTs and small bundles with
short (<500 nm) lengths as determined using scanning probe microscopy.12,33 UV–vis-NIR spectroscopy was also used to characterize BSA-SWNT
dispersions since the observation of sharp van Hove peaks is indicative
of aqueous solutions containing individually dispersed SWNTs.28 Figure 1,top shows a
representative absorption spectrum of a BSA-SWNT dispersion prepared
using four rounds of centrifugation where the sharp absorption features
correspond to the M11, S22, and S11 optical transitions of the metallic and semiconducting SWNT structures
contained in these dispersions. Of particular interest is the spectral
feature observed at ∼630 nm which appears to be a combination
of several overlapping peaks, most likely the M11 transition
of metallic (13,4) SWNT structures which absorb at ∼626 nm,
and the S22 transition of semiconducting (10,3) SWNT structures
which absorb at ∼633 nm.16

where the peak positions of the four metallic and five semiconducting
SWNT structures (denoted by their (n,m) chiral indices) were obtained by curve fitting of the RBM region
using a summation of Lorentzian line shapes.

Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize dispersed SWNT
samples,
and the diameter dependence of the radial breathing modes (RBMs) was
used to identify the particular SWNT structures that are resonant
with 632.8-nm excitation.34,35 Figure 1,middle shows a representative Raman spectrum of a BSA-SWNT
dispersion acquired with 632.8-nm excitation energy, chosen because
it probes metallic tubes with diameters >1.1 nm and semiconducting
tubes with diameters <1.1 nm.36 The
spectrum shows a number of well-characterized SWNT resonances, such
as RBMs in the 150–350-cm–1 region, the disorder-induced
mode (D-band) at ∼1280 cm–1, the tangential
stretching mode (G-band) at ∼1585 cm–1, and
the second-order G′-band at ∼2595 cm–1.37−39 Figure 1,bottom shows an expanded view of
the RBM spectral region where two distinct bands are observed, a low-frequency
group of peaks between 175 and 225 cm–1 and a high-frequency
group between 225 and 300 cm–1.

Since it is
well-known that the RBM spectral features of SWNTs
are sensitive to bundling, a series of Raman analyses described by
Hennrich et al.36 were performed to ensure
that our structural assignments would not be affected by the aggregation
state of BSA-SWNTs prepared using four rounds of centrifugation. These
analyses involved the use of a bundling ratio featuring (12,3) SWNTs
since these structures are in-resonance with ∼560-nm excitation
when individually dispersed but resonate at higher wavelengths (e.g.,
∼633 nm) when bundled.26,36 As shown in Figure 2, the (12,3)/(13,4)-bundling ratio (i.e., the ratio
of the peak area of the (12,3) resonance at ∼219 cm–1 to the peak area of the (13,4) resonance at ∼197 cm–1) calculated for the spectrum acquired from BSA-SWNTs prepared using
four rounds of centrifugation was 0.17. For comparison, the (12,3)/(13,4)-bundling
ratio calculated for a heavily bundled reference sample (i.e., the
first sediment of the BSA-SWNT dispersion-making process) was 1.22
and that for BSA-SWNTs acquired from the third supernatant of the
process was 0.30 (Figure 2). Since additional
centrifugation steps did not improve upon the 0.17-bundling ratio,
all remaining experiments involved well-dispersed BSA-SWNTs obtained
from the fourth supernatant of the dispersion-making process.

baseline-corrected Raman spectra (632.8-nm laser
excitation) of a HiPco BSA-SWNT dispersion (i.e., the fourth supernatant),
the third-supernatant of the BSA-SWNT dispersion protocol, and the
sediment from the first centrifugation of the BSA-SWNT dispersion
protocol; the (12,3)/(13,4) bundling ratios of the three samples were
0.17, 0.30, and 1.22, respectively. The spectra were offset for clarity
and normalized to a common intensity scale.

Assignment of RBM peak frequencies to specific (n,m) SWNT structures present in BSA-SWNT dispersions
was performed according to the methods of Strano et al.26 As shown in Figure 1,bottom,
the predominant SWNT identified in the low-frequency RBM region was
a metallic (13,4) structure with a 1.22-nm diameter and the predominant
SWNT identified in the high-frequency RBM region was a semiconducting
(10,3) structure with a 0.92-nm diameter. Other metallic SWNTs identified
in the low-frequency RBM region were (12,6), (9,9), and (12,3) structures,
and other semiconducting SWNTs identified in the high-frequency RBM
region were (11,1), (7,6), (7,5), and (8,3) structures. As shown in
Table 1, there is considerable agreement between
these assignments and those observed by others using HiPco SWNTs.
Specifically, the RBM frequencies of the four metallic structures
observed in BSA-SWNT dispersions were within 2% of those reported
by Strano et al. for SDS-dispersed HiPco SWNT samples,26 and the RBM frequencies of the five semiconducting
structures observed in BSA-SWNT dispersions were within 1% of those
reported by Hennrich et al. for sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS)-dispersed
HiPco SWNT samples.36 In summary, this
Raman data demonstrates that the metallic and semiconducting SWNT
resonances in HiPco BSA-SWNT dispersions are clearly distinguishable
when probed with 632.8-nm excitation energy, in accordance with previous
reports.26,40

SDS-PAGE/Raman Analyses of SWNT Material Extracted from NRK
Cells
The SDS-PAGE method exploits the observation that when
aqueous SWNT-containing samples are added to a SDS solution and then
subjected to SDS-PAGE, the SWNT material accumulates in a single band
at the interface between the loading well and the stacking gel, and
not elsewhere on the gel (Figure 3,inset).
In our previous work, the detection of cell-associated SWNT material
was demonstrated by incubating NRK cells in medium containing BSA-SWNTs
at various temperatures for 1–3 days.25 After incubation, the cells were washed and lysed, and cell-associated
SWNT material was extracted from the lysate and quantified using SDS-PAGE.
Using this method, the uptake of SWNT material by NRK cells was observed
to be linear with time and the applied dose and was not observed at
low temperatures, which is consistent with an uptake model involving
fluid-phase endocytosis.

a SDS-PAGE gel showing the control (left) and sample (right) lanes.
(Top) Representative Raman spectra (632.8-nm laser excitation) acquired
from a SDS-PAGE gel lane loaded with lysate from cells incubated in
medium containing ∼38 μg/mL HiPco BSA-SWNT material (solid

in medium without SWNTs (dashed line), following electrophoresis at
100 V for 2 h. (Bottom) Representative baseline-corrected 632.8-nm
Raman spectrum of the RBM region acquired from the dark band in a
SDS-PAGE gel lane loaded with lysate from cells incubated in medium
containing ∼38 μg/mL HiPco BSA-SWNT material following
electrophoresis at 100 V for 2 h. The peak positions of the four metallic
and five semiconducting SWNT structures (denoted by their (n,m) chiral indices) were obtained by curve
fitting of the RBM region using a summation of Lorentzian line shapes.

The same SWNT uptake and extraction
protocols were followed in
the present work with NRK cells that were incubated with BSA-SWNT
dispersions at 37 °C for 3 d. Aliquots of lysates from cells
incubated in medium containing ∼38 μg/mL of BSA-SWNT
material (and from control cells incubated in medium that did not
contain BSA-SWNTs) were subjected to SDS-PAGE at 100 V for 2 h, and
dark bands of material were evident only at the loading well/stacking
gel interface of lanes loaded with lysate from SWNT-treated cells.
Figure 3,top shows a representative Raman spectrum
acquired from the interface of the control gel lane, which demonstrates
that there are no Raman peaks emanating from control cells or the
PA gel that would interfere with the analysis of SWNT signals. Figure 3,top also shows a representative Raman spectrum
acquired from the dark band of material observed in the gel lane that
contained lysate from SWNT-treated cells; this spectrum displays all
of the well-characterized SWNT resonances observed in the spectrum
of the dispersed SWNT sample (Figure 1,middle).

Raman spectroscopy was also used to determine if the same metallic
and semiconducting SWNTs identified in aqueous BSA-SWNT dispersions
would be observed in the SWNT-containing gel bands of cell lysate
samples. As shown in Figure 3,bottom, the same
nine peaks observed in the low-frequency and high-frequency RBM bands
in the spectrum of BSA-SWNT dispersions are detected in the spectrum
acquired from the lysate of SWNT-treated cells. In addition, it is
important to note that the (12,3)/(13,4) bundling ratio acquired from
the gel bands of SWNT-treated cell lysates was determined to be 0.24,
which suggests that this material is not heavily bundled and would
therefore not influence SWNT structural assignments. In fact, the
RBM frequencies of the four metallic and five semiconducting SWNT
resonances acquired from SWNT-containing gel bands were within 1%
of those observed for BSA-SWNT dispersions (Table 1). In summary, since all the SWNT structures identified in
the Raman spectrum of BSA-SWNT dispersions applied to cells (Figure 1) were observed in the Raman spectrum acquired from
the dark gel bands of SWNT material extracted from cells (Figure 3), these results demonstrate that the SDS-PAGE/Raman
method can detect and distinguish metallic and semiconducting SWNT
structures in lysates of cells that had taken-up BSA-SWNTs. Furthermore,
the similar aggregation states of SWNTs observed in aqueous dispersions
and gel bands permits an assessment of preferential uptake of metallic
or semiconducting SWNTs through a comparison of RBM peak areas of
BSA-SWNT dispersions and lysate samples of SWNT-treated cells, as
described next.

Does the Uptake of BSA-SWNTs Depend on the
Electronic Structure
of the SWNTs?
To assess whether the electronic structure
of BSA-coated SWNTs plays a role in the NRK cell uptake process, the
metallic and semiconducting SWNTs observed in BSA-SWNT dispersions
were compared to those observed in lysate samples of SWNT-treated
cells. Specifically, the ratio of the Lorentzian areas of the predominant
SWNT structures observed in the low- and high-frequency RBM regions
(i.e., metallic (13,4) SWNTs and semiconducting (10,3) SWNTs, respectively)
was determined using spectra acquired from BSA-SWNT dispersions and
lysate samples of SWNT-treated cells. For BSA-SWNT dispersions, the
mean (13,4)/(10,3) ratio was 2.3 ± 0.12 (n =
6 spectra from n = 6 dispersions) and for SWNT-containing
cell lysates, the ratio was 2.4 ± 0.44 (n =
6 spectra from n = 3 gels). Since the ratios for
BSA-SWNT dispersions and SWNT-containing lysates are nearly identical,
the electronic structure of a BSA-SWNT does not appear to influence
the uptake of SWNTs by NRK cells. This finding is supported by our
previous work where the uptake of BSA-SWNT material was shown to be
consistent with a fluid-phase endocytosis model.25 With this model, as long as a particle is small enough,
the particle and the surrounding fluid are engulfed and internalized
in a vesicle/endosome regardless of the chirality of the SWNT. Conversely,
if SWNTs were to penetrate cells by passive diffusion or enter cells
by a selective uptake mechanism that involved a direct interaction
between the cell membrane and exposed SWNT regions, an electronic-structure
dependence would be possible that could favor certain SWNT structures.
Of course, one should not rule out the possibility that the behavior
observed here with HiPco-SWNT material will be different with other
mammalian cell lines and SWNT products.

Conclusion
The
key attributes of the SDS-PAGE method are that it enables a
population of cells to be assayed for cell-associated SWNT material,
and it enables straightforward investigations of SWNT parameters involved
in the uptake process (e.g., SWNT lengths, concentrations, and surface
chemistries), as well as, parameters required to assess the energy
dependence of uptake (e.g., cell incubation times and temperatures).12,25 Herein, we demonstrated that SDS-PAGE/Raman spectroscopy can detect
and distinguish metallic and semiconducting SWNTs in lysate samples
of cells that had taken-up SWNT material and that the uptake of BSA-coated
SWNTs by NRK cells is not influenced by the electronic structure of
the SWNTs. Since an enhanced understanding of the fundamental interactions
between cells and various SWNT structures is required for a number
of biomedical applications, we anticipate that the SDS-PAGE/Raman
method should find use in identifying metallic and semiconducting
SWNT structures in a variety of samples.
