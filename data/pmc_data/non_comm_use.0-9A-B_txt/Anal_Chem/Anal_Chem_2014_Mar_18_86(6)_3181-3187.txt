The study of high-affinity
protein interactions with equilibrium
dissociation constants (KD) in the picomolar
range is of significant interest in many fields, but the characterization
of stoichiometry and free energy of such high-affinity binding can
be far from trivial. Analytical ultracentrifugation has long been
considered a gold standard in the study of protein interactions but
is typically applied to systems with micromolar KD. Here we present a new approach for the study of high-affinity
interactions using fluorescence detected sedimentation velocity analytical
ultracentrifugation (FDS-SV). Taking full advantage of the large data
sets in FDS-SV by direct boundary modeling with sedimentation coefficient
distributions c(s), we demonstrate detection and
hydrodynamic resolution of protein complexes at low picomolar concentrations.
We show how this permits the characterization of the antibody–antigen
interactions with low picomolar binding constants, 2 orders of magnitude
lower than previously achieved. The strongly size-dependent separation
and quantitation by concentration, size, and shape of free and complex
species in free solution by FDS-SV has significant potential for studying
high-affinity multistep and multicomponent protein assemblies.

==== Body
High affinity protein interactions
are ubiquitous and play a central role in many spatiotemporal cellular
structures, including, for example, regulatory multiprotein complexes,
the quaternary architecture of ligand-gated ion channels, and immunological
recognition processes.1−4 Antibody–antigen interactions, in particular, are of key
importance in biotechnology, for the development of potent protein
pharmaceuticals and targeted drug delivery particles.5−7 Thus, it is of substantial interest to accurately characterize basic
thermodynamic parameters such as stoichiometry and free energy of
binding, from which often further mechanistic insights can be derived,
for example, on cooperativity and binding-induced conformational changes.8 Even though some methods for the observation
of high-affinity binding are widespread, for example, based on antibody
capture in ELISA,9 electrophoretic mobility
shift assays for protein–DNA interactions,10−12 and surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) and other biosensors,13,14 these may not be generally applicable to protein interactions, are
not always sufficiently quantitative, and/or fail in the presence
of more complex reaction schemes. On the other hand, classical methods
of physical biochemistry for analyzing protein interactions are frequently
very challenging to apply to high-affinity interactions, due to limited
detection of the low concentrations required for the mass action law
based equilibration short of saturation and/or due to the frequently
slow equilibration.

In the present work, we describe a new addition
to the toolbox
for characterizing high-affinity binding in free solution, made possible
by the previous introduction of a fluorescence detection system (FDS)
as an accessory for the analytical ultracentrifuge (AUC).15 By observing and modeling in detail the evolution
of concentration profiles of dissolved macromolecules arising from
the application of a strong centrifugal field, sedimentation velocity
AUC is widely accepted as a gold standard for determining the number,
size, and hydrodynamic shape of macromolecules and their complexes
in free solution16 and has emerged as a
rigorous and popular tool for the study of reversible protein interactions.17−19 Traditional applications of AUC are usually limited to the moderate
and weak affinity range due to the limit of sensitivity of absorbance
and Rayleigh interferometric optical detection systems.

The
AUC fluorescence detection system has opened the possibility
of significantly lower detection limits. Even though it was initially
mostly thought of and used as a qualitative tool,20−22 we have more
recently developed data analysis models that account for the unique
structure of FDS data, including optical effects of spatial gradients
of signal magnification and temporal signal drifts arising from residual
instability of laser power and potential photobleaching.23 Jointly, with recent studies on AUC calibrations24,25 and the choice of fluorescent labels in FDS,26 this has unequivocally explained previously observed systematic
deviations of FDS data from expected concentration profiles22,27 and resolved discrepancies between sedimentation coefficients measured
by conventional and FDS-detected AUC.24,28 Thus, FDS-SV
(fluorescence detected sedimentation velocity) has emerged as a highly
quantitative method for detection of macromolecular sedimentation
with a precision of the data and derived sedimentation parameters
rivaling or even superior to conventional detection systems.23

In the present work, we develop experimental
and analytical techniques
for FDS-SV suitable for the detection of the sedimentation coefficient
distribution of low picomolar protein concentrations and demonstrate
how this method can be exploited to characterize the binding of enhanced
green fluorescent protein (EGFP) to a bivalent monoclonal antibody
with low pM KD.

Experimental Section
Material
Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)
was prepared as described previously.22,29 EGFP was dissolved
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1 mg/mL carrier protein,
unless noted otherwise. For carrier proteins, we tested bovine serum
albumin (BSA), κ-casein, and lysozyme (A7030, C0406, and L6876,
respectively, all acquired from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and
purified by size-exclusion chromatography. Monoclonal anti-GFP IgG
D153-3 was purchased from MBL International
(Woburn, MA).

Sedimentation Velocity
Sedimentation
velocity (SV)
experiments were carried out in an Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge
(Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) equipped with a fluorescence detection
system (Aviv Biomedical, Inc., Lakewood, NJ) with a 10 mW laser emitting
a wavelength of 488 nm. Fourteen samples at a range of concentrations
were loaded in cell assemblies with standard 12 mm Epon double-sector
centerpieces, installed in an 8-hole rotor, and placed into the rotor
chamber for exhaustive temperature equilibration at 20 °C, typically
for 2–3 h, followed by acceleration to 50000 rpm. The focal
depth was set to 4 mm. For detection of the lowest concentrations,
the photomultiplier voltage was set to ∼72%, gain was set to
8, and scanning angles, typically 1.0–1.2°, were adjusted
to maximize exposure time individually for each sector without interference
from autofluorescence of the Epon centerpieces. After ∼10–15
min, scanning was commenced at the highest possible rate for 12 h,
with radial intervals of 20 μm.

Data Analysis
Sedimentation analyses were carried out
in the software SEDFIT (version 14.3) and SEDPHAT (version 10.6),
both available at sedfitsedphat.nibib.nih.gov. First, raw FDS data
were sorted for analysis into lists containing ∼200–500
scans evenly spanning 40000 seconds of sedimentation time. These sets
of fluorescence profiles were fit with sedimentation coefficient distributions c(s).30 Briefly, in this model
a quasi-continuous distribution of theoretical sedimentation patterns
of species with different s values is fitted directly
to the raw data, exploiting a hydrodynamic scaling law of compact
particles to relate sedimentation and diffusion coefficient via a
common, average frictional ratio. (30) The
distribution was discretized with a grid of 100–150 s values from 0 to 15 S, and maximum entropy regularization
at a confidence level of P = 0.68 was used to produce
the broadest distribution consistent with the data. In deviation from
the standard protocol, (31) for data with
low signal/noise ratios, no time- or radial-invariant baseline offsets
and no FDS-specific refinements were used, the meniscus was determined
graphically, and the average frictional ratio was fixed to the best-fit
value from high signal samples. For binding analyses, c(s) distributions were integrated from 1.0 to 9.5 S to create isotherms
of fractional binding and signal weighted-average sedimentation coefficients
(sw) as a function of loading concentrations,
and fit with mass action law models in SEDPHAT. Plots were created
with GUSSI (http://biophysics.swmed.edu/MBR/software.html). 

Results and Discussion
We have recently shown how the
approach of direct global modeling
of sedimentation boundaries with sedimentation coefficient distributions c(s)30 can be extended to SV
data with boundary signal amplitudes smaller than the statistical
noise of the data acquisition,22 due to
the large number of data points (104–105) typically acquired over the time-course of a sedimentation experiment.
For example, in an application to a study of the homodimerization
of the AMPA receptor GluA2 ATD using absorbance optical SV, this permitted
the determination of weighted-average sedimentation coefficients at
protein concentrations as low as 11 nM.22 We hypothesized that a similar approach would allow lowering the
limit of FDS detection, which was previously reported to require 0.1
nM to 10 μM fluorescein for useful sedimentation analysis.20,21

To optimize the sensitivity of the detection, we significantly
increased the FDS photomultiplier voltage above the level previously
applied22,23 and found an optimal signal/noise ratio
at a setting of ∼72% for our instrument. Typical FDS-SV data
at low picomolar concentrations of EGFP resemble those shown in Figure 1A. It is not obvious, and has not previously been
explored, whether the stability and noise structure of FDS scans lend
themselves for c(s) analysis of low signal/noise
data. However, even though it is difficult to visually discern the
sedimentation process, the large number of scans and data points acquired
leads to a well-defined peak in the c(s) analysis,
which is regularized with the maximum entropy method with uniform
prior32 so as to extract the least amount
of information and broadest distribution consistent with the data
(Figure 1B). The c(s) peak
is at an s value of 2.59 S, highly consistent with
previous results for monomeric EGFP at nanomolar to micromolar concentrations.23 The calculated loading signal at 4 pM EGFP is
17.6 counts, slightly larger than the standard deviation of the statistical
noise of data acquisition estimated to be 12.4 counts.

Figure 1 (A) Radial fluorescence
scans of 4 pM EGFP at different times (dots)
and best-fit boundaries from the c(s) model (lines).
For clarity, only every 2nd data point of every 20th scan is shown;
higher color temperature indicates later times. Even though no migrating
boundary pattern can be visually discerned in the noisy data, which
is classically a prerequisite to sedimentation velocity analysis,
this is not required in the modern analysis that is based on least-squares
fits of explicit sedimentation models to the entire data set comprised
of 247000 data points in 500 scans. (B) c(s) distribution
corresponding to the best-fit sedimentation boundaries in (A).

In the application of c(s) to FDS-SV data with
very low signal/noise ratio, we identified the following important
points: an unavoidable correlation of the adjustable baseline offset
with sedimentation patterns from species with extremely low sedimentation
coefficients causes the maximum entropy regularization to generate
a truncated peak at the low s value end of the distribution
(which is suppressed with Bayesian prior33 only for the very first s value). This can be diminished
or sharpened by inclusion of scans from later times, which in the
present case was taken up to at least twice the time required for
the complete sedimentation of EGFP. Further, due to fewer informative
scans reporting on species with higher s values,
regularization may produce a shallow increase in c(s) toward higher s values; this could in theory
be improved by faster data acquisition. This feature may also be contributed
to by initial laser intensity drifts, and it is therefore important
for the laser to be warmed up prior to data acquisition. Slight run-to-run
variations in these factors and the absolute magnitude of noise can
contribute variability of this feature. However, these features do
not interfere with the integration and further analysis of the clearly
developed main peak.

The meniscus position is an essential parameter
for the accurate
determination of sedimentation coefficients. In standard FDS-SV, there
is no fluorescence signal associated with the meniscus; it cannot
be recognized from characteristic optical artifacts at the air/water
interface as in conventional AUC with absorbance or Rayleigh interference
optical detection. Furthermore, at low signal levels it cannot be
implicitly defined as an adjustable parameter in the sedimentation
boundary analysis. To address this problem, Bailey et al.34 have previously proposed creating an artificial
interface with a layer of floating oil spiked with a fluorophore.
However, this procedure turned out to be unnecessary: at the high
PMT voltage used in the present study, we invariably observed a baseline
signal shift by ∼40 counts at the radius of the transition
from air to the aqueous solution column (Figure S1A of the Supporting Information). We believe this to arise
from Raman scattering of water: Our FDS instrument has a fixed excitation
at 488 nm and a fixed bandpass for detection from 505 to 565 nm, which
partially overlaps with the Raman shifted emission of water at low
wavenumbers. Even though the commercial detection system does not
currently provide wavelength resolution to measure the emission spectrum,
the notion that the signal increase at the air/water interface is
due to Raman scattering is supported by the observation of significantly
stronger signals for water/ethanol mixtures, as well as for pure D2O, as would be expected from the lower frequency of C–H
and O–D stretching as compared to O–H35,36 (Figure S1, panels B and C, of the Supporting
Information). Therefore, the water Raman signal unexpectedly
offers a convenient marker for the graphical definition of the meniscus,
eliminating potential concerns of fluorophore or protein adsorption
or degradation at an artificial water/oil interface. With the width
of the signal of the air-to-water interface being ∼0.015 cm,
the associated errors in s values are ∼ ±1%.

To prevent loss of protein by adsorption on the surface of cell
assembly components, the addition of an inert carrier protein is indispensable
when working at subnanomolar concentrations.20 Following common practice,20,22,37,38 initially we used BSA at 0.1–0.5
mg/mL for this purpose but observed significant signal contributions
scaling in amplitude with BSA concentration (Figure S2 of the Supporting Information). For example, at 0.5
nM EGFP in the presence of 0.5 mg/mL BSA, a trace of 2.8% of the total
signal could be resolved sedimenting at 4.3 S, which corresponds to
the characteristic s value of BSA monomers. The relative
contribution of the BSA signal increased with decreasing EGFP concentration,
such that at 4 pM EGFP, the BSA monomer peak and a smaller dimer peak
constitute the dominant signals even at the lowest suitable BSA concentration
(0.1 mg/mL) (Figure S2 of the Supporting Information). Such signals may arise from scattering and imperfections in the
emission filters, from Raman scattering, and/or as a result of fluorescent
ligands bound to BSA;39,40 notably, however, they could
not be removed by size exclusion chromatography or exhaustive dialysis
(data not shown). Although a separate measurement of the carrier protein
allows one to account for these signal contributions to the weighted-average sw value of the fluorescent protein of interest
and its complexes, and the BSA contributions may in favorable cases
be hydrodynamically resolved (Figure S2 of the Supporting Information), a preferable approach is the use
of a carrier protein that does not show significant fluorescent signal
contributions. This was the case for ∼0.1 mg/mL lysozyme or
0.075–0.2 mg/mL κ-casein, both chromatographically purified.
The latter was used in the following experiments.

A second critical
aspect for the choice of carrier protein is that
it be inert toward the protein(s) of interest. This can be tested
by FDS-SV or conventionally detected SV at higher protein concentrations
in the presence and absence of carrier. For any given protein, this
needs to be tested. For example, the use of κ-casein may potentially
be problematic, considering the associated phosphate groups, lysozyme
considering its positive charge (pI 11.4), and BSA considering its
propensity for binding a large number of compounds. The relative size
of the carrier to the protein of interest did not appear to play a
significant role, as 0.1 mg/mL aldolase (MW 157 kDa) functioned as
an efficient carrier for EGFP despite its much faster sedimentation.

Sedimentation coefficient distributions of EGFP at low picomolar
concentrations are shown in Figure 2. Below
1 pM, no reliable signal was obtained. However, >1 pM could be
reproducibly
detected and at >2 pM EGFP, the reliable quantitation of the sedimentation
coefficient distribution is possible.

Figure 2 Sedimentation coefficient distributions
of EGFP at various concentrations
in PBS with 0.075 mg/mL κ-casein.

In order to test if this high sensitivity of detection can
be utilized
to characterize protein interactions at picomolar concentrations,
we chose the system of EGFP, interacting with a monoclonal anti-GFP
antibody (mAb). The same antibody–antigen system was previously
chosen by Kroe & Laue20 as a model
for demonstrating the capabilities of the FDS, but no KD could be determined by FDS in the previous study and,
unexpectedly, the presence of only 1:1 complexes was reported. In
light of the well-known bivalency of IgG antibodies,41 the authors hypothesized steric hindrance to occur, even
though structural considerations would make this rather unlikely.41 Thus, we anticipated that revisiting this system
would highlight whether these molecules interact in an unusual mode
or whether there are intrinsic problems with FDS-SV, yielding incorrect
stoichiometries.

Figure 3 Titration series of 8 pM EGFP with mAb in PBS with 0.1
mg/mL κ-casein. s-values of 1:1 and 2:1 complexes
were determined from experiments
under stoichiometric conditions with EGFP or mAb in excess, respectively.

With the approach described above,
we were able to conduct mixing
experiments of EGFP and mAb at up to 20000-fold lower EGFP concentrations
than studied previously.20 As shown in
Figure 3, significant binding is apparent from
the detection of faster sedimenting components at ∼7–8
S at pM concentrations of EGFP. We believe that detection of a single
complex peak has previously led to misinterpretation of the stoichiometry
of the EGFP-mAb complex formation.20 However,
due to the relatively small mass difference of EGFP and IgG, 1:1 and
2:1 complexes (∼180 kD and 210 kD, respectively), resolution
of these species as two peaks would not be expected. Nevertheless,
the data in Figure 3 show a peak shift, from
7.12 S at 8 pM EGFP and 100 pM mAb to 7.35 S at 8 pM EGFP and 4 pM
mAb, reflecting different majority populations of single and double
occupied complexes when conditions with excess EGFP are compared with
those of excess mAb, consistent with the expected bivalency of the
IgG antibody. Similar peak shifts are observed in all titration series
at constant EGFP at higher concentrations (data not shown). Finally,
in experiments at high concentrations leading to essentially stoichiometric
binding, conditions with greater than 2-fold excess of EGFP over mAb
led to a complex s value of 7.55 S, whereas with
2.1-fold excess of mAb over EGFP, an average complex s value of 7.18 S was observed (data not shown). This led to an s
value of 7.06 S for the 1:1 complex after accounting for binominal
statistics of single- and double-occupied complexes and corroborating
the formation of both 1:1 and 2:1 complexes, as expected on the basis
of the IgG structure.41

For quantitative
analysis of binding affinity, experiments at various
concentrations of EGFP and mAb were carried out. The total EGFP signal
was found to be independent of mAb concentration, showing the absence
of quenching in the complex, and, trivially, there was no signal contribution
of the free antibody. From the calculated c(s) traces
of each experiment, different binding isotherms are available: (1)
The overall signal average sedimentation coefficient, sw, from integration of both free and complex peaks of c(s), follows the corresponding signal average s value of species populations predicted from mass action law, irrespective
of the reaction kinetics.42 It is intimately
related to the overall mass balance (corresponding to the change in
area under the boundaries) and, therefore, can be reliably determined
without hydrodynamic resolution of different species.42,43 (2) The fraction of signal sedimenting in the complex relative to
the total signal as a function of antibody concentration and (3) the
average s-value of the complex peak (experimentally
least well-determined at very low levels of complex) can be modeled
either with mass action law for reactions with complex lifetimes that
are slow on the timescale of sedimentation or with the effective sedimenting
particle model44 for reactions that are
fast on the timescale of sedimentation.

Taking advantage of
the large number of samples that can be run
in a single experiment with FDS, a global analysis was performed for
a series of 14 samples with different concentrations and molar ratios
of EGFP and mAb. For the analysis, we implemented a model in SEDPHAT,
based on the mass action law with two equivalent sites and mixed EGFP:mAb
complexes of 1:1 and 2:1 stoichiometry, that fits the isotherms of
free and total bound EGFP signal (which is the sum of both complexes)
and does not require the distinction in the experimental data between
the different stoichiometry complexes. This led to best-fit values
for the microscopic KD of the equivalent
sites of 20.5 pM (95% CI 16.9–25.4) and sedimentation coefficient
of 7.19 S (95% CI 6.96–7.43) and 8.02 S (95% CI 6.87–9.12)
for the 1:1 and 2:1 complex, respectively (Figure 4). (When both complex s values were constrained
to the values estimated for the complexes under conditions of essentially
stoichiometric binding, as described above, a best-fit microscopic KD of 18.1 pM was determined at a slightly narrower
95% CI of 16.0–21.4 pM.) This corresponds to values for the
macroscopic binding constants of ∼10 and ∼40 pM, respectively.

coefficients (sw) as a function of composition

and (B) the signal fraction of bound EGFP for the same experiments.
A global analysis of all data shown with a model of each mAb having
two equivalent sites for EGFP results in best-fit isotherms (lines)
with KD = 20.5 pM.

A crucial question when carrying out binding experiments
for high-affinity
interactions is whether the reaction has come to thermodynamic equilibrium.
This may not be a priori obvious, as high-affinity systems, in particular,
may exhibit very slow chemical off-rate constants. To examine the
potential influence of sample equilibration kinetics, we performed
kinetic simulations (Methods S1 of the Supporting
Information). Our results suggest that if the measured bound
fractions are kinetically limited, they will still monotonically increase
with concentration and may even be satisfactorily fitted with impostor
equilibrium binding models where the isotherm midpoint is shifted
to higher concentrations (Figures S3 and S4 of the Supporting Information). Kinetic simulations suggest that
nonequilibrium experiments impose a limiting apparent affinity on
the order of KD,app ≥ (texp × kon)−1 (where texp is the incubation
time and kon is the chemical on-rate constant)
irrespective of the true KD, which may
be much lower. Antibody–antigen reactions, typically have on-rate
constants kon in the range of 106–108 M–1 sec–1.45 For example, if an interaction with
a true KD of 10 pM and kon of 107 M–1 sec–1 (koff = 10–4 s–1) was allowed to incubate for only 100 s, the resulting
binding isotherm would be well-described with an apparent KD,app, an order of magnitude above the true
value (or 2 orders of magnitude above the true value for kon = 106 M–1 sec–1 and koff = 10–5 s–1, respectively). On the other hand, with incubation
times of 10000 s, which is comparable with the experimental timescale
of SV, the overestimate of KD,app would
amount to only 10% (or a factor of 2, respectively). Thus, the slow
timescale of SV with equilibration times on the order of a few hours
appears to be a virtue, rather than limitation.

Kinetically
limited binding assays may be readily identified by
increasing the incubation time (leading to a proportionally lower KD,app) and/or by carrying out side-by-side experiments
directly mixing the reactants in combination with dilutions of pre-equilibrated
stock mixtures that are allowed to relax for different lengths of
time, as shown by simulations in Figures S5 and S6 of the Supporting Information. Thus, we tested our FDS-SV
study of the EGFP and mAb for kinetic control with pre-equilibration/dilution
experiments. A mixture of 40 pM EGFP and 100 pM mAb was prepared by
mixing aliquots from stock solutions of each protein. From this sample,
after incubation for a time t100pM, we
took aliquots, diluted them 10-fold to a final concentration of 4
pM EGFP and 10 pM mAb, and let them relax to the new equilibrium for
different times t10pM prior to SV. With t100pM of 1020 s and t10pM of 18600 s, we measured an swvalue of
4.89 S; with t100pM of 16020 s and t10pM of 4600 s, we measured 4.85 S. (As a control,
the original sample of 40 pM EGFP + 100 pM mAb with t100pM of 19600 s without dilution yielded an sw value of 6.49 S.) Finally, a sample of 4 pM EGFP + 10
pM mAb was prepared by directly mixing aliquots from separate stock
solutions of each protein, and incubated for only 4600 s prior to
SV, leading to an sw value of 4.75 S.
The sw values of the different 4 pM EGFP
mixtures are very close and consistent within error, which demonstrates
that all mixtures are close to equilibrium, irrespective of whether
attained through predominantly assembly or dissociation processes.
Therefore, for this high-affinity protein binding system, the slow
kinetics of the dissociation of the complex does not seem to have
significant impact on the FDS-SV results.

It is of interest
to compare FDS-SV with other biophysical techniques
for determining the binding properties. Optical biosensing (such as
SPR) is an attractive approach for its direct observation of the binding
kinetics. However, for reliable measurements of KD, it still requires experimental times on the order of
1/koff. A particular concern for interactions
with picomolar affinities is that at high on-rate constants, diffusional
transport to the surface becomes limiting, whereas for low offrate
constants, the baseline stability of the instrument limits accurate
measurement of slow dissociation kinetics.14

We conducted an SPR biosensor experiment with immobilized
mAb flowing
EGFP across the sensor surface (Figure S7 of the Supporting Information). As is typically the case in SPR,
the measured sensorgrams showed strong deviations from the expected
pseudo-first-order binding progress.14,46 However, a
model accounting for a continuous distribution of affinity and rate
constants46 described the data well, reflecting
significant heterogeneity of sites induced by immobilization and/or
heterogeneity of the physical and chemical microenvironment of the
sensor surface and polymeric immobilization layer. The largest population
(comprising 48.8% of sites) was found to be at KD ∼ 0.16 nM and koff ∼
3 × 10–4 s–1. This is 8-fold
weaker than observed by FDS-SV, highlighting commonly observed (but
protein dependent) discrepancies of affinities for surface-immobilized
molecules versus solution affinities.14,47,48 In principle, an SPR competition approach could be
used to determine the solution KD;14,47−49 however, this may not be practically applicable for
systems with KD < 0.1 nM.49 In the present case, it was precluded due to
the unexpected cross-reactivity of soluble mAb to the sensor surface
(which may account for the lower affinity of immobilized mAb for free
EGFP; data not shown). This highlights the advantageous capability
of FDS-SV to allow the observation of binding in free solution, in
the absence of any matrix, filter, or other surface. Even though fluorescent
labeling will generally be required, which itself carries the potential
for artifacts,26,50 it is often possible to use competition
experiments between labeled and unlabeled proteins to determine the KD for the interaction between unlabeled molecules,21 similar to the surface competition approach
in SPR.

Another approach for measuring high-affinity interactions
that
combines fluorescence detection with hydrodynamic separation of free
and complex species has recently been described on the basis of size-exclusion
chromatography.51 While it is even more
sensitive with femtomolar detection limits, we believe FDS-SV, where
applicable, will offer several advantages: first, the hydrodynamic
resolution in SV is generally stronger (if RS is the particle Stokes radius, the resolution in SV is dependent
on RS2, but in size-exclusion
chromatography it is dependent on RS–1), and separation is quantitative. Second, rigorous
frameworks for data analysis are available in SV independent of the
reaction kinetics,42,44,52 whereas chromatographic separation requires slow dissociation. Finally,
some proteins interact with the matrix during size exclusion chromatography,
while SV experiments are performed in free solution in a matrix free
environment.

Other spectroscopic methods such as fluorescence
anisotropy and
fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy in a standard gravitational
field are usually not sufficiently sensitive for determination of KD below 0.1 nM.53−56 Like fluorescence spectroscopy
and energy transfer methods, they usually do not lend themselves equally
well as SV to determine the number and size of complexes formed,57 although these techniques share other advantages,
such as compatibility with microscopy and in vivo applications. Another
popular method for studying protein interactions, isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC), lacks the sensitivity for the measurement of sub-nanomolar KD’s and leads to stoichiometric binding
at cell concentrations with detectable enthalpies (high “c value” conditions), unless a suitable low-affinity
competitor is available for displacement experiments.58 Generally, ITC can provide information on the reaction
stoichiometry, but for the analysis of more complex reactions, requires
independent information on the possible complex states.59

Conclusions
In the present work,
we have developed a new approach to extend
sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation into the low
picomolar concentration range and demonstrated how this can be used
to determine the KD of binding between
EGFP and a monoclonal IgG antibody of 20 pM. Previously, the useable
concentration range of FDS-SV was considered to be 0.1 nM to 10 μM
fluorescein,20,21 and the lowest KD measurable by FDS-SV was characterized to be “10
nM or less”.20 Obviously, precise
detection and KD limits will depend on
the fluorophore, but we have demonstrated in the present work limits
that are two or more orders of magnitude lower.

In summary,
the key considerations for practical work at such low
considerations in FDS-SV are (1) the careful choice of the PMT voltage
and laser power (where this adjustment is possible) so as to obtain
the best possible signal/noise ratio, (2) the choice of a carrier
protein (other than BSA) that can be shown in control experiments
to not contribute to the signal itself, to be inert with respect to
the protein(s) of interest, and to effectively block surface adsorption
of the protein of interest, (3) the data acquisition over a long time
interval well past the sedimentation of the proteins of interest,
(4) for the c(s) analysis, the graphical determination
of the meniscus from the Raman offset visible at the air/water interface,
and (5) the inclusion of as many scans as possible.

This work
adds a unique tool to the analysis of high-affinity interactions.
We believe the most important opportunity of FDS-SV is the observation,
in free solution, of not only the degree of binding of a fluorescent
ligand but, simultaneously, also the number and size of complexes
and their ligand binding. This will offer the potential to study multistep
and multicomponent interactions, possibly integrated with other biophysical
methods in global multimethod analyses.47 Importantly, FDS-SV inherits from SV with conventional optical detection
the compatibility with detergent and nanodisc systems for the study
of solubilized or reconstituted membrane proteins.60,61

Method
S1: simulation of kinetically
limited binding. Theory S1: lower bounds for apparent KD estimates from kinetically limited binding. Figure S1:
signal increase at the air/water meniscus from Raman scattering for
H2O, H2O/EtOH, and D2O. Figure S2:
sedimentation coefficient distributions observed by FDS-SV for (unlabeled)
BSA at different concentrations, in the presence and absence of EGFP.
Figures S3 and S4: simulated kinetically limited binding data and
best-fit impostor equilibrium isotherms as a function of chemical
on-rate constant and reaction time. Figures S5 and S6: simulated kinetically
limited mixing and predilution experiments as a function of chemical
on-rate constant. Figure S7: fit of the SPR data with a model for
a distribution of sites with different affinity and kinetic rate constants.
