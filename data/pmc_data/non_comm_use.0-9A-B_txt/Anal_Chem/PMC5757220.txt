Metaproteomics,
the mass spectrometry-based analysis of proteins
from multispecies samples faces severe challenges concerning data
analysis and results interpretation. To overcome these shortcomings,
we here introduce the MetaProteomeAnalyzer (MPA) Portable software.
In contrast to the original server-based MPA application, this newly
developed tool no longer requires computational expertise for installation
and is now independent of any relational database system. In addition,
MPA Portable now supports state-of-the-art database search engines
and a convenient command line interface for high-performance data
processing tasks. While search engine results can easily be combined
to increase the protein identification yield, an additional two-step
workflow is implemented to provide sufficient analysis resolution
for further postprocessing steps, such as protein grouping as well
as taxonomic and functional annotation. Our new application has been
developed with a focus on intuitive usability, adherence to data standards,
and adaptation to Web-based workflow platforms. The open source software
package can be found at https://github.com/compomics/meta-proteome-analyzer.

==== Body
The key role of microbial consortia
has recently gained increased attention due to promising findings
on their functional repertoire in the human intestinal tract. Complex
microbial communities fulfill essential host-related functions regarding
nutrient uptake, digestion, and immune response.1 Importantly, the human gut microbiome has also been correlated
with pathological states such as type-2 diabetes,2 cardiovascular disease,3 Crohn’s
disease,4 inflammatory bowel disease,5 and obesity.6,7 In more general
terms, the importance of microbial communities is related to the well-known
fact that microbes are critical to the niche system (e.g., human host)
in which they reside. One of the most common approaches for studying
microbial communities presents genome analysis, using either 16S rRNA
gene sequencing or shotgun whole metagenome sequencing.8 While these techniques are highly useful tools
for gaining insights into the composition and functional potential
of a microbial community, these do lack the ability to capture the
actual functional profile of such a community at a given time point
and under specific conditions. However, such profiling is essential
to demonstrate that predicted biological processes are actually present
and active in a given sample and can be only gained from the functionally
active snapshot of microbial communities.9 Metaproteomics, the mass spectrometry-based analysis of multispecies
proteins from microbial samples, aims to elucidate the functional
expression and taxonomic origin of such microbial consortia.10−12 This proteomic technique is also employed for rapidly detecting
pathogens and studying their host-adaptation mechanisms.13 The application of metaproteomics has led to
promising findings in recent studies for which disease-associated
protein markers could be identified, e.g., when analyzing samples
from bovine blood serum14 or human oral
saliva.15 While throughput and resolution
of instrumentation have evolved dramatically within the past decade,
the analysis and interpretation of the upcoming data still remains
a challenge. This can mainly be attributed to the complexity and heterogeneity
of microbiome samples, which can contain proteins from hundreds or
thousands of different species.16 Despite
the increase in popularity of metaproteomics, existing proteome bioinformatics
methods have not yet been sufficiently adapted to adequately address
these challenges,17 and tailored solutions
for metaproteomics remain rare.18−21

In this article, we present the MetaProteomeAnalyzer
(MPA) Portable
software and demonstrate all novel features and improvements which
have been developed since the original MPA publication.21 MPA Portable is a lightweight and freely available
application which serves as a one-stop solution for processing and
analyzing metaproteomics data. In contrast to the original server-based
MPA software,21 the MPA Portable tool requires
no further installation steps and is independent of any relational
database system. In addition to the graphical user interface (GUI),
which can be used for in-depth data exploration, a command line interface
(CLI) has also been added to MPA Portable. This allows the program
to be executed as part of a larger, scripted workflow, for instance,
on a high-performance cluster environment. While a standalone version
(including a guided tutorial) is available for download on the GitHub
Web site (https://github.com/compomics/meta-proteome-analyzer), the whole MPA workflow has also been included within the community-accepted
multiomics informatics platform of Galaxy-P.22 In addition to the previously supported database search engine X!Tandem,23 the newly developed software now also integrates
the SEQUEST-derivative Comet24 and MS-GF+25 as search algorithms. Similar to the original
development, MPA Portable also allows the results of multiple search
engines to be combined to increase the overall peptide and protein
identification yield, but it adds the ability to perform an optional
two-step search workflow.26 In the two-step
searching approach, the spectra are first matched against a wide search
space (e.g., the whole UniProt database) without applying any FDR
filtering. On the basis of the results of this search, the proteins
with at least one PSM are retained by which a new sequence database
is created. In a second round, a typical search against the reduced
search space is applied with stringent FDR filtering. The objective
of such an iterative search procedure is to increase the number of
highly confident peptide spectrum matches and, consequently, to improve
overall protein identification yield. This strategy is particularly
useful for metaproteomics data analysis which usually suffers from
a decreased identification rate when searching against large protein
sequence databases, which is in turn caused by the higher chance of
retrieving high-scoring false positive identifications.27 Moreover, to improve compatibility with existing
proteomic software tools, the import of files stored in the mzIdentML
standard data format (version 1.2)28 has
been also implemented. This latter feature is particularly useful
for the reprocessing of identification results that have been generated
using external tools or elsewhere, as is for instance the case for
data obtained from the public domain PRIDE database.29Figure 1 provides an overview of an MPA Portable workflow, comprising all
typical steps of data processing, ranging from the input of MS/MS
spectra, over protein identification, to the MPA-specific postprocessing
features such as protein grouping and automated sequence annotation
at the taxonomic and functional level.21

Figure 1 Overview
on the MPA Portable workflow. The software can be accessed
using either the graphical user interface (A) or the command line
interface (B). User-provided MS/MS spectra (C) are processed within
the application for matching against a FASTA database by up to three
different search algorithms (X!Tandem, MS-GF+, and Comet) (D). As
an alternative to conventional searching, a two-step search (E) can
be applied to iteratively reduce the search space. Further postprocessing
steps (F) include grouping of homologous proteins to meta-proteins
and the fully automated assignment of peptides and protein to taxonomic
levels and functional annotations, as described for the original MPA
software package.21

We tested our proposed software workflow on two experimental
data
sets from samples with known composition. The first benchmarking data
set was established by mixing the bacterial strains (5BCT) Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Micrococcus luteus, and Desulfovibrio vulgaris with a protein ratio
of 1:1:1:1:1. The corresponding sample was prepared in-house and sample
specifications can be found in the Supporting Information. The mass spectrometry data have been deposited
to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via PRIDE,29 with data set identifier PXD007681. In addition, the second data
set which was used for evaluation derived from a lab-assembled mixture
of nine microbial organisms (9MM) published by Tanca et al.30

The first evaluation concerned the performance
of the newly integrated
search algorithms in MPA Portable against UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (2016/12/13)
with regard to the accuracy when assigning peptides to given reference
taxa at the species level. In this analysis, the assignments were
classified at the peptide level as follows (i) “correct unique”
when a peptide was matched unambiguously to a protein from the correct
taxon, (ii) “correct” when a peptide was matched to
the correct taxon but was also shared with proteins from incorrect
taxa, and (iii) “incorrect” when a peptide was assigned
to species which were not contained in the original sample. In addition,
we also applied a taxonomy filter after combining the search results
within the MPA application (as previously described by Tanca et al.30) corresponding to 5% of the total number of
taxon-specific assignments. Thus, only taxa with a higher number of
peptide assignments than the specified filter threshold were taken
into consideration in that case.

The results show that the combination
of hits from multiple search
engines within the MPA Portable workflow significantly increases the
number of correct unique and correct taxon-specific peptides (Figure 2). In addition, the
results show that the number of incorrect assignments could be decreased
by filtering for the most abundant organisms using a relatively high
threshold of 5%. However, for more complex samples, it is not recommended
to use such a stringent taxonomic filtering, as it may considerably
reduce the proportion of sparsely identified but essential organisms.

Figure 2 Taxon-specific
peptide assignment performance for 5BCT and 9MM
reference data. The numbers of correct unique, correct (i.e., unique
and shared) and incorrect taxon-specific peptide identifications are
shown as bar charts for data sets 5BCT (A) and 9MM (B) when using
X!Tandem (blue), Comet (orange), MS-GF+ (violet), and MPA Portable
with an applied taxon filter (TF) of 5% (green). For the latter, the
results of all three database search algorithms were combined by taking
the union of all hits. The data sets were searched against UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
and filtered by an FDR threshold of 1%.

The second evaluation of our software concerned the effect
of the
newly implemented two-step search strategy. In general, the composition
and size of the protein sequence database has a strong impact on the
results in any proteomics data analysis workflow, and it has been
recommended to focus on relevant sequences for better identification
yields.31 In metaproteomics, however, the
actual microbial composition in the sample is commonly unknown and
the identification of relevant sequences is therefore highly problematic.
Indeed, it would be particularly damaging to introduce selection bias
by the mistaken removal of relevant taxa and their reference proteomes.
To automate the process of building a sample-optimized search database
with sufficient taxonomic coverage and depth, we therefore implemented
the previously described two-step search approach.26 To evaluate the performance of two-step in comparison to
conventional searching, we first searched the 9MM data set of known
species composition against a tailored database which only contained
the protein sequence sets from the nine expected organisms. Next,
we matched the same data set against UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot using (i)
conventional and (ii) two-step searching. The two-step method was
used by searching against the whole database without applying any
FDR threshold in the first round. The protein identifications obtained
from this first round then serve as the reduced database in a second
round search on the same data. In this second round, a stringent FDR
threshold of 1% is applied to reduce the number of false positive
hits. For each search setting, the peptide identifications were classified
into correct and incorrect taxon assignments as described above. We
also applied a taxonomy filter with a threshold ranging from 0% to
10% to test the influence of this parameter. In this analysis, the
database search results from all three search algorithms X!Tandem,
Comet, and MS-GF+ were combined by taking the union of the respective
hits.

The results of the search method evaluation can be found
in Figure 3. As expected,
the
most correct taxon assignments at the peptide level could be obtained
when searching the data against the 9MM reference database (Figure 3A). When searching
the same data against the whole UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database, on
average, only around 69% of the original hits could be correctly assigned.
This can be explained by the increased search space and the peptide
sequence ambiguities among homologous species. When applied to the
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot search, the two-step searching approach recovered
around 80% of the peptides originally identified against only the
9MM reference database, thus showing better performance than the standard
search. However, the proportion of incorrect species assignments is
also higher for two-step approach when compared to the standard search
(Figure 3B). Fortunately,
this effect can be minimized when increasing the taxon filter threshold,
demonstrating that the two-step approach is optimally beneficial when
used in combination with taxonomic filtering. It should be noted,
however, that the results from the described two-step approach should
be treated carefully as the actual FDR of the overall process is likely
to be higher than the 1% FDR set for the second round.27

Figure 3 Performance evaluation of standard versus two-step
searching for 9MM reference data. The numbers of correct (A) and incorrect
(B) taxon-specific peptides at 1% FDR are shown as line charts for
the 9MM data set, which was searched against a tailored reference
database (green) and against UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot using standard search
(blue) and two-step search approach (violet). The taxonomy filter
shown on the x-axis was applied for values between
0% and 10%. Note that incorrect taxon-specific peptides were not found
for the tailored reference database, since only known microbial species
were included in the search database.

The availability of the MPA Portable software marks another
step
toward fulfilling the needs of the metaproteomics community, which
requires reliable and easily accessible solutions for analyzing its
valuable high-throughput data. Moreover, the addition of a command-line
interface to MPA Portable enables analyses using high-performance
cluster hardware.32 This is particularly
important in the context of metaproteomics, because searches are often
performed against very large protein sequence databases to cover a
wide taxonomic range (e.g., UniProtKB/TrEMBL33 with over 88 million entries as of July 2017). In our evaluation
on the performance of the taxonomic assignment, a rather limited number
of fewer than 10 species from microbial mixture samples was used.
However, data from more complex samples are required to improve the
performance of our pipeline. Overall, the research community of metaproteomics
would strongly benefit from such well-defined reference data for benchmarking
and optimization of analytical workflows and software tools. Moreover,
the thorough assessment of protein FDR estimation represents an important
next step in the field which would highlight demand that tools still
need to become more reliable at the statistical side for making results
better reproducible. It should be also noted that the output of the
command-line execution of MPA Portable can be fully imported into
the GUI, thus allowing large data sets (e.g., hundreds of thousands
to millions of MS/MS spectra) to be analyzed on a cluster environment,
while being visualized in the application on a local desktop computer.
Consequently, MPA Portable now offers users the combination of usability
with computational power in a single package. Finally, to make the
developed software even more hardware-independent and sustainable,
it has also been integrated into the Galaxy-based workflow for metaproteomics
analysis.34 Similarly, we plan to distribute
it within the system-agnostic BioContainers framework which allows
software to be installed and executed under an isolated and controllable
environment.35
