We
report the femtomolar detection of silver (Ag) nanoparticles
by direct-impact voltammetry. This is achieved through the use of
a random array of microelectrodes (RAM) integrated into a purpose-built
flow cell, allowing combined diffusion and convection to the electrode
surface. A coupled RAM-flow cell system is implemented and is shown
to give reproducible wall-jet type flow characteristics, using potassium
ferrocyanide as a molecular redox species. The calibrated flow system
is then used to detect and quantitatively size Ag nanoparticles at
femtomolar concentrations. Under flow conditions, it is found the
nanoparticle impact frequency increases linearly with the volumetric
flow rate. The resulting limit of detection is more than 2 orders
of magnitude smaller than the previous detection limit for direct-impact voltammetry (900 fM) [J. Ellison et al. Sens. Actuators, B2014, 200, 47], and is more than 30 times smaller than the previous detection
limit for mediated-impact voltammetry (83 fM) [T.
M. Alligrant et al. Langmuir2014, 30, 13462].

==== Body
There is
considerable interest
in nanoparticles (NPs) from both fundamental and application perspectives.1 Current methods for the detection and characterization
of NPs are varied but primarily consist of optical techniques such
as ultraviolet–visible light (UV-vis) spectroscopy, dynamic
light scattering (DLS), or NP tracking analysis (NTA). UV-vis spectroscopy
allows for the detection of monodisperse NP samples; yet, it is limited
by inaccuracies in measuring polydisperse systems.2 This is a characteristic shared by DLS, which is significantly
influenced by the scattering of larger particles and has been reported
to have inaccuracies in population distributions of up to several
orders in magnitude when dealing with polydisperse systems.2 NTA is less affected by polydispersity and can
operate with samples consisting of 107–109 particles per mL, which is equivalent to a lower limit of detection
of 16.6 fM.3 However, a common feature
shared by all optical detection methods is their cost and inability
to analyze samples of poor optical clarity.4 Electrochemical detection is a potentially inexpensive and simple
method for the detection and characterization of electroactive NPs
that is indifferent to optical clarity but has previously relied largely
on bulk drop-cast studies.5 Unfortunately,
such methods cannot provide key information on the size distribution
of the particles and have been shown to suffer from incomplete stripping,
because of surface agglomeration/aggregation.6−8 This is a significant
drawback and indicates the need for the continued development of new
detection methods for NPs that provide both low detection limits and
reliable particle size distributions.

Recent advancements in
electrochemical NP sensing has seen the
detection of single NPs via the “nanoimpacts” technique.
Nanoimpacts can be classified in two broad categories: direct and mediated. Direct impacts involve
Faradaic charge transfer between the particle and the electrode and
subsequent reaction of the particle9 (e.g.,
dissolution), while mediated impacts involves charge
transfer to solution species mediated via the colliding particle (e.g.,
hydrazine on the surface of platinum (Pt) NPs).10 An example of the former case is the electro-oxidation
of an impacting silver (Ag) NP: 1  

The arrival of a particle is indicated
by a spike in current during
the current–time transient. Each spike corresponds to an individual
impact event and can be integrated to determine the charge, Q:11 2  where I is the current, F the Faraday constant, ρ
the density of the material, rNP the radius
of the NP, and Ar is the relative atomic
mass of the material. The spike
charge provides quantitative information about the number of atoms
in the NP and this charge transfer is known to be quantitative, even
for particles are large as 100 nm.12 If
the latter is assumed to be spherical, then sizing information is
obtainable using the equation13 3  where DNP is the
spherical diameter of the particle (DNP = 2 × rNP) and n is the number of electrons transferred per Ag atom. The direct-impact method allows both the concurrent measurement of concentration14 and the sizing of NPs, providing a significant
benefit over other techniques. This method has been applied successfully
to the detection of Ag NPs in both opaque solutions4 and seawater15 at a microdisk
electrode. Ag NPs are an excellent model system for direct impacts
and have been utilized for proof of concept works including shape
determination, hindered diffusion effects, and agglomeration/aggregation
processes.16−18

The direct-impact technique has hitherto been
conducted in stationary
systems, relying on diffusional mass transport of particles to the
microdisk electrode surface. Under these conditions, the use of microwire
electrodes is thought to be optimal and has been shown to achieve
a detection limit of 900 fM.19 Crooks and
co-workers have developed an alternative mediated approach to detecting Ag NPs through functionalization of magnetic
microbeads with multiple NPs and enhancing the collision rate of the
functionalized beads with an ultramicroelectrode. The reported Ag
detection limit was 61 fM.20 For real-world
applications sensors require low operating costs, simplicity of operation
and fast response. Mediated and magnetically guided bead/particle
impacts,20,21 while interesting from a research point
of view, challenge these requirements and an alternative is warranted.
In the present work, we focus on direct-impact electrochemistry.

Forced convection provides an additional and efficient way of increasing
mass transport to an electrode surface by decreasing the diffusion
layer thickness.22,23 Traditionally, rotating disk
electrodes (RDEs) have been employed by electrochemists, because of
the distinct advantages of laminar flow and well-established theory,
which allows in-depth analysis of interfacial kinetics.24−26 However, flow cells have distinct advantages in that they are all-sealed
units that are less prone to turbulence, and are readily adapted to
colloidal systems.27 Flow cells have found
applications in both research and industry, because of their online
detection capabilities, with examples including heavy metal detection28 and biological redox processes.29 Recent work has also exploited enhanced mass transport
by flow for the detection of NPs via the mediated-impact method and has achieved detection limits of 83 fM.30

As well as introducing convection, another clear
avenue for enhancing
detection limits for direct impacts is the use of
larger electrode areas. To date, the majority of impact studies have
used single microelectrodes, because of their enhanced radial diffusion,
high signal-to-noise, and their lack of moving parts. However, the
use of microelectrodes comes with limitations. They are known to have
a high degree of fragility, making them unsuitable in some applications,31 and they often require extensive shielding to
optimize the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio.32 Larger electrode areas have already shown to give enhanced detection
limits by use of the microwire electrode19 but are not easily integrated into a flow regime. Therefore, an
alternative is sought that provides an inherently high S/N ratio while
measuring the collision frequency under flow to allow low limits of
detection. Arrays of gold (Au) microelectrodes with 25 μm for
the smaller diameter and 30–180 μm for the larger diameter
have been adapted from conventional electronic integrated circuit
chips.33,34 However, these are rather large, and smaller
carbon electrodes are preferred for the present purposes. For this
reason, we use the random array of microelectrodes (RAM) approach
pioneered by Fletcher and Horne.35 These
RAMs consists of hundreds of carbon fibers connected in parallel to
a current collector. This arrangement provides current amplification
proportional to the number of active fibers, while maintaining radial
diffusion. RAMs can also be repolished to provide a clean and reproducible
surface, facilitating ease of use and maximizing applicability to
real systems.

The ultimate limit of detection in impact electrochemistry
is a
single entity; however, the technique suffers because the time that
is required for the entity to reach the probe by random walk alone
can be on the order of tens of thousands of seconds for extremely
dilute samples.18 Here, we describe a method
to increase the rate with which entities collide with an electrode
by invoking convective mass transfer using a flow cell, allowing for
the analysis of femtomolar levels of Ag NPs. The flow response of
the system is first characterized by the molecular redox species potassium
ferrocyanide. This is then extended to the concurrent detection and
sizing of citrate-capped Ag NPs at femtomolar concentrations with
the effect of volumetric flow rate on the frequency of impacts reported.

Experimental
Section
Chemical Reagents
Citrate-capped Ag NPs nominally 50
nm in diameter were purchased from nanoComposiX (San Diego, CA, USA)
with a Ag content of 0.02 mg mL–1. These were independently
characterized by DLS analysis (Malvern Zetasizer, Malvern, U.K.) and
were found to be 58 nm in diameter. Therefore, the stock was calculated
to have a Ag NP concentration of 31.0 pM. Potassium ferrocyanide (K4Fe(CN)6, 99.0%) was supplied by BDH Chemicals (London,
U.K.) and potassium chloride (KCl, 99.0%) by Sigma–Aldrich
(Gillingham, U.K.). Water used for dilutions was distilled using a
Millipore system to achieve a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm at 298
K.

Electrochemical Instrumentation
A three-electrode system
was used for all electrochemical measurements. The counter electrode
was a graphite rod (Sigma–Aldrich) and the reference electrode
was an in-house-fabricated 3 M KCl, Ag/AgCl reference, with a potential
of −0.032 mV vs SCE. Two RAMs35 were
used as working electrodes for experiments, consisting of ∼7-μm-diameter
carbon fibers insulated with cured epoxy resin and having an average
electrode separation of 70 μm. While different RAMs were used
in various experiments, the results have been normalized by the number
of active fibers for each RAM to allow direct comparison. The number
of active fibers varies between RAMs, because of the manufacturing
process, and was calculated as follows. Cyclic voltammetry of the
RAMs was conducted under stationary conditions in 1 mM K4Fe(CN)6 and 0.10 M KCl at 100 mV s–1 and is reported in Figure SI 1 in the
Supporting Information. The limiting current obtained can be related
to the number of active fibers (Nfib),
assuming a fiber diameter of 7 μm and microdisk geometry: 4  where Ilim is the limiting current, rdisk the radius
of the fiber, D the diffusion coefficient,
and c* the concentration of K4Fe(CN)6. Using this equation, the RAMs were found to have 663 and
436 functional fibers, respectively. For initial flow cell characterization,
an in-house-fabricated 4.15-mm-diameter glassy carbon (GC) electrode
was used. Both an Autolab PGSTAT 302N (Metrohm-Autolab, Schiedam,
The Netherlands) and an in-house-built low-noise potentiostat36 (250 Hz sampling rate, 4-pole Bessel filter)
were used for all electrochemical experiments.

The chronoamperometry
experiments performed for nanoimpact detection were conducted for
20 s with the vision of eventual practical applications, which require
fast detection capabilities. The limit of detection can be further
decreased by increasing the time scale of the experiment.

Flow Cell Instrumentation
The flow cell was designed
and built in-house. It allows the interchange of working electrodes,
with a washer allowing control over the inlet–working electrode
distance. A schematic design is shown in Figure 1, and full schematics are reported in the Supporting Information. Figure 1 shows the demountable flow cell system,
which is built from three separate sections that are bolted together.
The three main cell components were manufactured from polyether ether
ketone (PEEK), with Delrin used for the reference and working electrode
holder. During operation, solution is flowed through the cell, using
a computer-controlled Fusion 100 Chemyx syringe pump (USA), and is
injected onto the electrode surface through a 0.5-mm-diameter inlet
hole. The inlet–electrode distance can be altered by using
different washer thicknesses; however, the distance was maintained
at 2 mm for all experiments conducted herein. The flow is then strained
by the central component through 8 pores, each 0.5 mm in diameter,
before passing into a pressure-equalizing well containing the counter
and reference electrodes. The positioning of the electrodes in this
cell ensures that the electroactive solution components cannot be
affected by the counter electrode before reaching the working electrode.

Full schematics are reported in the Supporting Information.

Initial Flow Cell Characterization
using a Glassy Carbon Macroelectrode
Initial characterization
of the flow was carried out using a GC
macroelectrode. Linear sweep voltammetry was conducted in 1 mM K4Fe(CN)6 and 0.10 M KCl from −0.05 V to +0.70
V vs Ag/AgCl over a range of volumetric flow rates. The results are
reported in Figure SI 2 in the Supporting
Information. Steady-state limiting current values (Ilim) were obtained and plotted as log10(Ilim) vs log10(flow rate), as shown
in Figure SI 3 in the Supporting Information
to obtain a slope of 0.74 ± 0.08. This is in excellent agreement
with the Levich equation for a wall jet with Ilim ∝ Vf3/4:37 5  where υ is the kinematic
viscosity, α the diameter of the jet nozzle, and Vf the volumetric flow rate.

Results and Discussion
Prior to nanoimpact detection, the effects of flow on the steady-state
response for molecular species was first studied. This provided an
estimate of the possible increase in detectivity achievable by this
system. Linear sweep voltammetry was conducted in 1 mM K4Fe(CN)6 and 0.10 M KCl from −0.05 V to +0.70 V
vs Ag/AgCl at 100 mV s–1 with a RAM across a range
of flow rates. Figure 2 shows example voltammograms obtained at 0, 6, 20, 35, and 50 mL
min–1. The RAM is found to give a steady-state response
under stationary and flow conditions, confirming the diffusional independence
of the individual microfibers in the RAM. As the volumetric flow increases,
the steady-state response is maintained, along with an increase of
the Ilim. Figure 3 shows a plot of log10(Ilim) vs log10(flow rate) for a range
of flows from 0 to 50 mL min–1. A clear trend is
observed with a slope of 0.41 ± 0.01. The dependence of the transport
limited current at the RAM with flow rate is less than that observed
for the GC macroelectrode. This reflects the changed electrode geometry38 and indicates that the RAM is comprised of many
microelectrodes, each of which has a lower sensitivity to flow, compared
to a macroelectrode. The increase in Ilim from a diffusional-only regime to the maximum volumetric flow rate
used of 50 mL min–1 was found to be from 0.63 μA
to 2.90 μA, equivalent to an enhancement of signal of almost
5 times.

Figure 2 Flow dependence of RAM in 1 mM K4Fe(CN)6 +
0.10 M KCl at 100 mV s–1 at 0, 6, 20, 35, and 50
mL min–1.

Figure 3 Log/log plot of Ilim vs volumetric
flow rate for a RAM in 1 mM K4Fe(CN)6 + 0.10
M KCl at 100 mV s–1 with a slope of 0.41 ±
0.01. Inset shows a plot of Ilim versus
the volumetric flow rate.

Next, the flow dependence of Ag NP impacts was conducted
using
the RAM–flow cell. Figure 4 shows current–time transients, 20 s in duration,
at +0.60 V vs Ag/AgCl at a NP concentration of 6.2 fM in 40 mM KCl
across the experimental flow range of 0–50 mL min–1. This potential was chosen because it is suitable for the complete
oxidation of Ag NPs up to 100 nm in diameter.12 No impacts were observed under stationary flow, because of the low
concentration. When the NP suspension was flowed at 10 mL min–1, current spikes were detected, indicative of Ag NP
oxidation. The frequency of spikes was observed to increase with increasing
volumetric flow rate. The noise of the system was not significantly
affected by flow rate and remained <100 pA, even at the highest
flow rate of 50 mL min–1, allowing clear, unambiguous
detection of the current spikes. The background current is likely
due to surface oxidation of the RAM electrodes and/or residual citrate
used for capping the particles. In order to validate that the current
spikes observed were due to direct-impact voltammetry
of the Ag NPs, these were analyzed using eq 3 to obtain the size distribution. This is
shown in Figure SI 4 in the Supporting
Information, along with DLS characterization of the particles. The
size of the particles determined by voltammetry and DLS was determined
to be 57.0 ± 1.5 nm and 58 nm, respectively, confirming quantitative
sizing of the particles alongside detection at a Ag NP concentration
of 6.2 fM.

Figure 4 Example current–time transients recorded at varying flow
rates showing nanoimpact spikes. Current–time transients were
conducted at +0.60 V vs Ag/AgCl at a Ag NP concentration of 6.2 fM
in 40 mM KCl. Inset shows an enlarged image of a current spike at
10 mL min–1 (circled region in top portion of the
figure). The background consists mainly of capacitively coupled mains
interference (50 Hz in the United Kingdom).

Finally, a lower concentration of 2.5 fM NPs was studied
under
the same conditions. Figure 5 shows the change in impact frequency with flow rate for this
concentration and 6.2 fM. No impacts were observed at a Ag NP concentration
of 2.5 fM with volumetric flow rates up to 20 mL min–1. It can be seen that, for the lower concentration, high flow rates
are required to detect particle impacts, and this stresses the benefits
of flow over diffusion-only mass transport for NP impact voltammetry.
At higher flows, however, NP impacts were detected. This is the lowest
concentration of NPs ever used in a successful nanoimpact experiment,
with an enhancement in experimental detectivity by 2 orders of magnitude
over earlier attempts19 and by 1 order
of magnitude for mediated impacts.30 Hitherto, the lowest reported experimentally detected concentration
of NPs by direct impacts is 900 fM, using a carbon
fiber microwire electrode.19 Nonspecific
adsorption is inherent in NP chemistry and can have an effect on the
concentration of NPs in suspension. As a result, a lower frequency
of impacts may be observed, leading to errors in concentration estimates.
In addition, care must be taken to minimize agglomeration/aggregation
during nanoimpact experiments. Readers interested in experimental
aspects of the electrochemistry of particles are directed to the work
of Tschulik et al.39

a Ag NP concentration of 6.2 fM and 2.5 fM. Current–time transients
were conducted at +0.60 V vs Ag/AgCl in 40 mM KCl.

Conclusions
Femtomolar nanoparticle
(NP) concentrations have been detected
for the first time by direct-impact voltammetry, because of enhancement
of mass transport by flow. The method detailed herein allows determination
of the presence of NPs and their concurrent sizing. We have demonstrated
that the frequency of impacts increases monotonically as the concentration
increases. The actual frequency is likely to be affected by nonspecific
adsorption and agglomeration, as discussed in previous works.21,30,40 This is an improvement of more
than 2 orders of magnitude in the detection limit, relative to that
previously reported.41 This extremely sensitive
detection is a direct result of combining flow with a RAM electrode,
increasing the signal-to-noise ratio. The presented method can be
adjusted for sizing smaller NPs by choosing different array geometries
in order to have suitable noise characteristics. This is of significant
importance for the field of analytical NP detection and is a proof
of principle for NP detection by direct-impact voltammetry
under flow conditions. Further applications of the developed methodology
may include applications to biological systems with the objective
of the development of point of care sensors for viruses and bacteria
through simple yet highly efficient methods.
