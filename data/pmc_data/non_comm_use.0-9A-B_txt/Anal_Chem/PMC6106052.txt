The complexity of
mammalian proteomes is a challenge in bottom-up
proteomics. For a comprehensive proteome analysis, multidimensional
separation strategies are necessary. Online two-dimensional liquid
chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS/MS) combining
strong cation exchange (SCX) in the first dimension with reversed-phase
(RP) chromatography in the second dimension provides a powerful approach
to analyze complex proteomes. Although the combination of SCX with
RP chromatography provides a good orthogonality, only a moderate separation
is achieved in the first dimension for peptides with two (+2) or three
(+3) positive charges. The aim of this study was to improve the performance
of online SCX-RP-MS/MS by applying displacement chromatography to
the first separation dimension. Compared to gradient chromatography
mode (GCM), displacement chromatography mode (DCM) was expected to
improve the separation of +2-peptides and +3-peptides, thus reducing
complexity and increasing ionization and detectability. The results
show that DCM provided a separation of +2-peptides and +3-peptides
in remarkably sharp zones with a low degree of coelution, thus providing
fractions with significantly higher purities compared to GCM. In particular,
+2-peptides were separated over several fractions, which was not possible
to achieve in GCM. The better separation in DCM resulted in a higher
reproducibility and significantly higher identification rates for
both peptides and proteins including a 2.6-fold increase for +2-peptides.
The higher number of identified peptides in DCM resulted in significantly
higher protein sequence coverages and a considerably higher number
of unique peptides per protein. Compared to conventionally used salt-based
GCM, DCM increased the performance of online SCX-RP-MS/MS and enabled
comprehensive proteome profiling in the low microgram range.

==== Body
Despite recent technological
advances in mass spectrometry, which have led to increased speed,
sensitivity, resolution, and mass accuracy, the complexity of mammalian
proteomes remains a major challenge in bottom-up proteomics. Although
high proteome coverages can be obtained with one-dimensional liquid
chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis
using reversed-phase (RP) ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography
(UHPLC) and modern high resolution orbitrap and Q-TOF instruments,1,2 deep proteome profiling requires multiple dimensions of separation.3 Two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC)
separation is most often used with low pH RP chromatography directly
coupled to MS analysis in the second dimension. For the first separation
dimension, several techniques exist such as high pH RP chromatography,4 hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography
(HILIC),5 and strong cation exchange (SCX)
chromatography.6,7 Multidimensional peptide separation
methods can be used either offline or online, having their own advantages
and disadvantages.8 Offline separation
strategies offer a higher degree of freedom in optimizing parameters
for each separation dimension. In addition, fractions collected in
the first dimension can be reanalyzed and sample size can be reduced
by combining different fractions. Online approaches are more easily
automatable, offer an improved recovery, and reduce sample losses
and contamination.9

One of these
online approaches is the multidimensional protein
identification technology (MudPIT) pioneered by Yates and coworkers,
which combined SCX with RP-LC-MS/MS analysis and became the template
for many online 2D-LC-MS/MS approaches.6,7 In conventionally
used online SCX-RP-MS/MS, the peptides are first loaded onto a SCX
column, where they bind to the SCX material via electrostatic interactions.
The peptides are usually eluted from the SCX column onto the RP column
by injecting increasing concentrations of a volatile salt. In between
the salt injections, the peptides are separated by an ACN gradient
applied to the RP column and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry.
The SCX-RP-LC-MS/MS approach is the most frequently applied online
2D-LC-MS/MS approach in bottom-up proteomics. Under the acidic condition
of the eluent with formic acid as an additive, which is mainly used
for conventional online SCX-RP-MS/MS analysis, most tryptic peptides
are doubly positive charged (+2). One charge is based on a basic residue
such as lysine or arginine at the C-terminus. The second charge is
due to the N-terminal amino group. Tryptic peptides with a three (+3)
or even a higher number of positive charges are expected due to internal
histidine, lysine, or arginine residues.10 The combination of SCX with RP chromatography provides a good orthogonality
but only a moderate separation efficiency for tryptic peptides in
the first dimension (SCX) because peptides with two (+2) and three
(+3) positive charges tend to elute in clusters.11,12

In the early 1940s, Tiselius defined an alternative chromatography
mode called displacement chromatography (DC).13 DC is based on competitive binding of the components themselves
and the displacer molecule. First, the column is equilibrated with
a carrier solution that is also used as the sample application buffer.
The carrier solution must support a high binding affinity for the
analytes toward the stationary phase.14 During sample loading, the analytes arrange themselves according
to their affinity in a process described as sample self-displacement.15,16 The analyte with the highest affinity toward the stationary phase
is binding to the chromatographic material at the top of the column,
displacing analytes with lower affinities from their binding sites.
Compared to conventionally used gradient chromatography (GC), 50–100%
of the column binding capacity is used for sample loading in DC.10,14 The analytes are eluted in DC by loading a molecule onto the column
called “displacer”, which is usually dissolved in the
carrier solution. It is mandatory that the displacer has a very high
affinity toward the stationary phase. Ideally, the displacer has a
higher affinity toward the stationary phase than any of the sample
analytes. Upon adsorption of the displacer to the stationary phase,
it displaces the analyte with the highest affinity bound to the top
of the column. Each displaced analyte itself acts as a displacer for
the adjacent analyte with a lower affinity toward the column. This
leads to the formation of a “displacement train”.14,17,18 In a displacement train, the
analytes move down the column in a system of contiguous zones with
rectangular shapes. The zones will keep their rectangular shape even
if mass transfer resistances and slight kinetic or flow misdistributions
are present, while these effects are responsible for bandspreading
in elution chromatography.14,19 The self-sharpening
effect of the boundaries between the zones during the displacement
process increases the effectiveness of the separation. Provided the
column is sufficiently long and the analytes are present in sufficient
quantities, each zone contains only one analyte in a high purity.14 Thus, displacement chromatography mode (DCM)
offers several advantages for peptide separation in SCX such as an
improved separation of peptides in accordance to their charge state
compared to gradient chromatography mode.10,20 However, DCM has been so far only applied to proteomics in a few
cases.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether DCM
applied to
the first separation dimension improves the performance of online
SCX-RP-MS/MS compared to conventionally used GCM due to a better separation
of peptides according to their charge states.

Experimental Section
A detailed description of the materials and methods used for this
study is included in the Supporting Information, whereas concise descriptions of the materials and methods are presented
below.

Online SCX-RP-MS/MS Setup
An OPTI-PAK SCX trap column
(5 μm particle size, 120 nL bed volume, Dichrome, Marl, Germany)
was used for the online SCX-RP-MS/MS analysis. The SCX trap column
was installed directly behind the injection valve (nanoACQUITY, Waters,
Manchester, UK) or the autosampler valve (UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano,
Dionex, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) (Figure S-1). The SCX trap column was connected to a RP trapping
and a RP separation column that was directly coupled to a ESI-Q-TOF200 (Q-TOF Premier, Micromass/Waters, Manchester,
UK) or a ESI-Q-IT-OT201 (Orbitrap Fusion,
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). A detailed description
of the online SCX-RP-MS/MS setup is included in the Supporting Information.

Determination of SCX Binding
Capacity and Displacer Pulses
Binding capacity of the SCX
trap column was determined by repeated
injections of 400 ng tryptic peptides (HeLa digest, c = 1 μg/μL, 0.1% FA dissolved in HPLC-H2O,
buffer A). Peptides were loaded on the SCX column with a flow-rate
of 3 μL/min with 2% buffer B (0.1% FA, dissolved in ACN) and
separated in the second dimension by RP chromatography using a linear
gradient from 2 to 30% buffer B in 30 min (300 nL/min). Peptides were
analyzed by ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS as described in the Supporting Information.

Displacer pulses were determined
by loading 5 μg of tryptic peptides (tryptic HeLa digest, c = 1 μg/μL, dissolved in buffer A) on the SCX
column (2% buffer B, 3 μL/min). Peptides were eluted from the
SCX column by repeated injections of the displacer molecule spermine
(m = 25 ng, dissolved in buffer A), separated by
RP chromatography and analyzed by ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS as described above.
For separation with optimized displacer pulses, 5 μg tryptic
peptides (tryptic HeLa digest, c = 1 μg/μL,
dissolved in buffer A) were loaded on the SCX column (2% buffer B,
3 μL/min). Elution was achieved by injection of the following
displacer pulses: pulse 1:150 ng spermine, pulse 2–5:25 ng
spermine, pulse 6–8:50 ng spermine, pulse 9:1000 mM NH4Ac (dissolved in buffer A).

Online SCX-RP-MS/MS Analysis
in DCM and GCM
For separation
in DCM and GCM, 5 μg tryptic peptides (tryptic HeLa digest, c = 1 μg/μL, dissolved in buffer A) were loaded
on the SCX column (2% buffer B, 3 μL/min). Elution in DCM was
achieved by injection of the displacer molecule spermine (dissolved
in buffer A) and in GCM by injection of increasing NH4Ac-concentrations
(dissolved in buffer A). Details of displacer and NH4Ac
injections are shown in Table 1. Peptides eluting from the SCX column were separated by RP
chromatography with a linear gradient from 2 to 30% buffer B in 30
min (300 nL/min) and analyzed by ESI-Q-IT-OT-MS/MS as described in
the Supporting Information.

Data Analysis
MS raw data were processed
with MaxQuant
(version 1.5.2.8). Peptide and protein identification was carried
out with Andromeda against a human SwissProt database (UP000005640,
downloaded November 10, 2016, 20 161 entries) and a contaminant
database (298 entries). The searches were performed using the following
parameters: precursor mass tolerance was set to 35 ppm (Q-TOF MS analysis)
or 8 ppm (OT MS analysis) and fragment mass tolerance was set to 0.1
Da (Q-TOF MS/MS analysis) or 0.5 Da (IT MS/MS analysis). For peptide
identification, two missed cleavages were allowed, a carbamidomethylation
on cysteine residues (static modification), an oxidation of methionine
residues, and acetylation of protein N-terminus (variable modifications).
Peptides and proteins were identified with a false discovery rate
(FDR) of 1%. Proteins were quantified with the MaxLFQ algorithm21 considering only unique peptides and a minimum
number of two unique peptides per protein.

For generating peptide
charge state (PCS) plots, the charge of peptides at pH 2.3, the pH
of the mobile phase of the SCX in DCM and GCM, of each identified
peptide in relationship to its amino acid sequence was calculated.
The calculation was performed with a Mathematica script (Wolfram research,
version: 11.1.1.0) as follows: +1 for each basic amino acid (H, K,
R), +1 for the N-terminus, unless the N-terminus was acetylated as
described.10

The mass spectrometry proteomics
data were deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE
partner repository with the data set identifier PXD008562.

Results
and Discussion
Determination of Binding Capacity and Displacer
Pulses
A mandatory step for a successful chromatographic
separation in displacement
chromatography mode is the determination of the total binding capacity
of the sample and the displacer for the chosen column. The column
should be saturated with the sample, and appropriate amounts of the
displacer have to be applied. The binding capacity of the SCX column
was experimentally determined by repeated injections of tryptic peptide
aliquots (m = 400 ng) onto the SCX column in the
online SCX-RP-MS/MS setup (Figure S-1 A). Base peak chromatograms (BPCs) of the first 12 injections showed
almost identical peak patterns with no considerable differences from
the first to the twelfth injection (Figure S-2). The peaks in the BPC were mainly caused by peptides with a peptide
charge state (PCS) of +1, such as peptides from both the N-terminal
and C-terminal region of the proteins (Figure S-3 A). The affinity of these peptides toward the SCX material
was not high enough to be retained under the loading conditions. The
term PCS used in this manuscript describes the charge states of individual
peptides in the mobile phase of the SCX at a pH of 2.3 and is not
to be confused with the charge state z of peptides
in the gas phase of the mass spectrometer. With the 13th injection,
a change in the BPC was observed (Figure S-2) and the number of emerging peaks was caused by peptides with a
PCS of +2 (Figure S-3 B). These peptides
eluted from the SCX column due to low affinities and/or sample displacement.22 According to the amount of injected peptides
necessary to cause a change in the BPC, the binding capacity of the
SCX column was between 4.8 and 5.2 μg.

Next, amounts for
displacer pulses were determined. For this, 5 μg of a tryptic
HeLa digest were loaded onto the SCX column. For elution, the polyamine
spermine was used as a displacer. At pH 2.3, spermine has a charge
state of +4. Peptides were eluted from the SCX by pulsed injections
of 25 ng spermine. To visualize the efficiency of the SCX separation,
the number of identified peptides with PCSs ranging from +1 to +5
was plotted against the displacer pulses to obtain a PCS plot (Figure S-4). Sample loading (pulse 0) resulted
mainly in the detection of peptides with a PCS of +1 that had the
lowest affinity toward the SCX column. The pulsed displacer injections
resulted in a good separation of peptides according to their PCSs.
Peptides with a PCS of +2 (pulse 4–13) eluted first followed
by peptides with PCS of +3 (pulse 14–20) and +4 (pulse 18–20).
Sharp boarders between the different PCS zones with a low degree of
overlapping highlights the separation power of displacement chromatography
mode. These results are consistent with the results obtained by Ahrends
et al.10 and Trusch et al.20 for SCX separation of tryptic peptides in DCM using spermine
as a displacer. For optimizing both separation and analysis time,
the amount of the displacer was fitted to the observed elution behavior
(Figure S-4). The separation of 5 μg
of a tryptic HeLa digest with the defined displacer pulses resulted
in a good separation of the peptides according to their PCSs (Figure S-5). Peptides with a PCS of +2 mainly
eluted within the first 5 displacer pulses, followed by peptides with
a PCS of +3 (displacer pulse 6–9) and +4 (displacer pulse 8
and pulse 9 (1000 mM NH4Acet)). Compared to the approach
of Trusch et al.,20 the total analysis
time was reduced from almost 120 h, and a sample amount of more than
one milligram to 8.5 h and a sample amount of 5 μg. Once the
binding capacities and displacer pulses are defined and optimized,
these parameters can be used for online SCX-RP-MS/MS analysis in displacement
chromatography mode for complex proteomes after tryptic digestion
because the peptide charge state distribution of tryptic peptides
is similar for human, mammals, yeast, and bacteria (Table S-1).

Separation Space
To investigate
whether DCM improves
the performance of online SCX-RP-MS/MS compared to conventionally
used salt-based GCM in terms of a better separation of peptides according
to their PCSs, 5 μg of a tryptic HeLa digest were separated
either by DCM or GCM. Visualization of the SCX separation showed that
with both DCM and GCM, a separation of peptides according to their
PCSs was achieved (Figure 1). However, the elution profiles were considerably different.
While in GCM most of the peptides with a PCS of +2 eluted within the
first two ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) pulses (Figure 1B), peptides with a PCS of
+2 were separated over 5 displacer pulses in DCM (Figure 1A). This observation is consistent
with the theory of displacement chromatography, where analytes with
a low affinity toward the stationary phase, such as peptides with
a PCS of +2, elute in broad zones.14 With
increasing affinity, analytes elute in zones with decreasing width
and higher concentrations, which is consistent with the results observed
for the majority of peptides with a PCS of +3 and +4 that eluted within
three displacer-pulses each. In GCM, peptides with a PCS of +2 and
+3 showed a distinct coelution upon the first pulse at a low NH4Ac concentration (c = 25 mM). Furthermore,
a broad elution width and coelution of peptides with PCS of +3 and
+4 was observed in GCM. This observation made in GCM is consistent
with the results of Gilar et al.,11 who
investigated the orthogonality of separation in 2D-LC, and revealed
that in SCX-RP peptides with a PCS of +2 and +3 cannot be effectively
separated from each other in the first dimension of separation (SCX)
using GCM. In contrast, DCM provided an almost complete separation
of peptides with a PCS of +2 and +3 in remarkably sharp zones with
an extremely low degree of coelution (Figure 1A).

Figure 1 SCX separation of tryptic peptides in displacement
chromatography
mode (A) and gradient chromatography mode (B) in online SCX-RP-MS/MS
analysis. For visualization of the SCX separation, the number of identified
peptides with peptide charge-states (PCS) ranging from +1 to +5 were
applied against the pulse number (median with SD). The PCS of the
peptides were calculated based on their amino acid sequence at pH
of 2.3, the pH of the mobile phase during SCX.

The average purity of peptides with a PCS of +2 within the
first
5 displacer-pulses was 99.41% (±0.24%, Figure S-6), whereas purity of peptides with a PCS of +2 in the first
NH4Ac-pulse of GCM was 75.28% (±2.35%). Even for peptides
with a PCS of +3 and +4, a good separation was achieved in DCM resulting
in a purity for peptides with a PCS of +3 of 85.56% (±2.69%,
pulse 6), 78.73% (±3.2%, pulse 9), and 51.22% (±4.39%, pulse
8). Altogether, elution in DCM provided significantly higher purities
of the most abundant PCSs in each fraction compared to GCM except
for the last pulse, here, for both DCM and GCM NH4–Ac
injections were used. This result can be explained by the different
elution processes in DCM and GCM. In DCM, the peptides elute from
the column by pulsed injection of the displacer molecule. Due to its
high affinity toward the stationary phase the displacer forces peptides,
which have a lower affinity than the displacer to move down the column.
These peptides displace peptides with an even lower affinity, and
a displacement train is formed.14,18 When the displacement
train moves down the column, a self-sharpening effect increases the
purity within the bands, namely of peptides with the same PCS. In
GCM, peptides elute from the SCX column by suppression of electrostatic
interactions between negatively charged groups of the stationary phase
and positively charged groups of the peptide. Elution is achieved
by injection of increasing NH4Ac concentrations, but the
affinity of the NH4+-ions is not high enough
to induce a displacement train like in DCM. A self-sharpening effect
does not occur in GCM and peptides with a PCS of +2 and +3 coelute
and are not separated from each other in sharp-zones as in DCM, thus
application of DCM in the first separation dimension significantly
improves the performance of online SCX-RP-MS/MS.

This was further
confirmed by investigating the amount of information
obtained in DCM and GCM computed with Shannon entropy (SE) (Table S-2). The degree of information obtained
in DCM is higher than in GCM. Computation of SE showed that there
were higher probabilities to find a peptide for all the pulses in
DCM (Table S-2, Figure S-7). The reproducibility
of DCM and GCM was further investigated at the level of reported peptide
intensities (Figure 2, Figure S-8). DCM showed a considerably
higher degree of reproducibility compared to GCM (DCM: Pearson’s r = 0.93 ± 0.007; GCM: Pearson’s r = 0.79 ±0.057). A possible explanation for the higher degree
of reproducibility can be the better separation in DCM. This reduces
sample complexity and may reduce ion suppression effects during MS
analysis.23

in all replicates were considered for the analysis.

Peptide Identification Rates
Investigation
of peptide
identification rates at the PCS-level revealed no significant differences
for peptides with a PCS of +1, +3, and +5 (Figure 3). For peptides with a PCS of +4 a significantly
higher number of peptides was identified using GCM (n = 3,268 ± 336) compared to DCM (n = 2,406
± 80). This was expected, since spermine as a displacer with
a charge state of +4 efficiently displaces peptides with PCSs of +1,
+ 2 and +3. For peptides with a PCS of +5, no significant differences
were observed since these peptides were detected in DCM in the last
pulse representing the NH4Ac injection. For peptides with
a PCS of +1, no differences were observed as they were mainly detected
after sample loading (pulse 0). For peptides with a PCS of +2, a remarkable
and significantly higher number of identifications were achieved using
DCM (n = 20,360 ± 266) compared to GCM (n = 7,858 ± 607, Figure 3). This is of particular relevance since peptides with
a PCS of +2 represents the majority of tryptic peptides in human proteome
samples after tryptic digestion (Table S-1). DCM led to a 2.6-fold increase for the most prevalent PCS (+2)
due to the better separation efficiency for peptides with a low affinity
like peptides with a PCS of +2, which cannot be achieved in GCM (Figure 1). Notably, the number
of identified peptides with a PCS of +2 in DCM was almost as high
as the total number of identified peptides in GCM (Figure 3). In general, DCM provided
a 1.5-fold increase and a significantly higher number of peptide identifications
compared to GCM. With DCM, 32,930 (±261) different peptides were
identified compared to 21,740 (±526) different peptides in GCM.

GCM. Bar chart (median with SD) showing the number of identified peptides

(PCS: +1, +2, +3, +4, and +5) calculated from the peptide amino acid
sequences at pH of 2.3, the pH of the mobile phase during SCX. *: p < 0.05 (Kruskal–Wallis).

The number of identified peptides in GCM (21 740 ±
526) is consistent with the number of identified peptides in the study
from Krisp et al. (14 021).24 To
the best of our knowledge, the 5 μg sample amount, used in this
study, represents together with the study of Krisp et al. the lowest
sample amount used for online SCX-RP-MS/MS up to now. Compared to
the study of Krisp et al., who analyzed 5 μg of a tryptic thyroid
cancer cell line digest, a 2.3-fold increase in peptide identifications
was achieved in this study, applying DCM to the first dimension of
separation.

Magdeldin et al. used an online SCX-RP-MS/MS approach
in GCM with
similar NH4Ac pulses that were also used in this study
to analyze a tryptic digest of HEK293 cells.9 In their study, they used a sample amount of 100 μg and identified
24 771 peptides. Compared to the results obtained by Magdeldin
al., the application of DCM to the first separation dimension of online
SCX-RP-MS/MS revealed a higher number of identified peptides with
a 20-fold lower sample amount.

A comparison of the peptide identification
reproducibility based
on the peptides identified in all replicates revealed that with DCM,
a considerably higher degree of reproducibility was achieved compared
to GCM. The application of GCM resulted in a peptide identification
reproducibility of 59.4%, whereas DCM provided a reproducibility of
71.5% (Figure 4A).
With DCM 23 533 different peptides were reproducibly identified,
and with GCM, 12 916 different peptides. A possible explanation
for this observation is the better separation of the peptides over
several fractions in DCM, thus reducing complexity and the effect
of “undersampling”.25 A more
detailed investigation of the reproducibly revealed that 8780 peptides
were identified in both DCM and GCM (Figure 4B). However, the number of exclusively and
reproducibly identified peptides was considerably higher in DCM (n = 14 753) compared to GCM (n =
4136). Interestingly, the number of peptides, exclusively identified
in DCM, was even higher than the number of peptides identified with
both elution modes (n = 8780). These results reveal
that DCM and GCM show a certain degree of orthogonality and clearly
highlight the strength of DCM in the first dimension of an online
SCX-RP-MS/MS approach to analyze complex peptide mixtures.

A: Venn diagrams showing the reproducibility of DCM or GCM within
three replicates (I, II, III). B: Venn diagram showing the number
of peptides reproducibly identified in both (DCM + GCM) and exclusively
in DCM or GCM.

This is further underlined
by the fact that the majority of tryptic
peptides, derived from human samples, have a PCS of +2 under common
low pH conditions used in online online SCX-RP-MS/MS (62.8%, Table S-3). This means that most peptides have
a low affinity toward the SCX column under acidic conditions that
are typically used in online SCX-RP-MS/MS approaches. In GCM the majority
of identified peptides had a PCS of +3 (42.24%, +2-PCS: 36.35%), whereas
the majority of identified peptides in DCM had a PCS of +2 (61.24%),
followed by a PCS of +3 (27.3%), matching extremely well to the expected
distribution of PCSs after in-silico digestion of the human proteome
(Table S-3). Thus, DCM is very well suited
to analyze complex proteomes after tryptic digestion by online SCX-RP-MS/MS
due to a significantly improved separation and identification of peptides
with a PCS of +2. These results showed that the application of DCM
to the first separation dimension of online SCX-RP-MS/MS improves
their performance in terms of separation efficiency and detectability,
resulting in significantly higher peptide identification rates and
a better reproducibility compared to GCM. Furthermore, the use of
DCM represented an almost salt-free online SCX-RP-MS/MS approach compared
to GCM. With the exception of the last pulse, which was used to elute
the displacer molecule and to recondition the SCX column, no salt
additives were necessary to elute the peptides from the SCX column.
While the injection of increasing concentrations of NH4Ac in GCM led to an increase in pressure over time during the loading
process, no pressure increase was observed in DCM. Thus, the application
of DCM to the first separation dimension provided excellent compatibility
with downstream RP-LC-MS analysis.

Protein Identification
Rates
The performance of displacement
chromatography mode (DCM) and gradient chromatography mode (GCM) was
further compared at the protein level. Based on reported protein intensities,
DCM showed a higher degree of reproducibility compared to GCM (DCM:
Pearson’s r = 0.94 ± 0.006; GCM: Pearson’s r = 0.86 ± 0.028, Figure 5, Figure S-9).
A comparison of the number of identified proteins, where at least
two unique peptides had to be identified per protein, showed that
a significantly higher number of proteins could be identified in case
of DCM (n = 3853 ± 36) compared to GCM (n = 3266 ± 24, Figure 6 A). Compared to the study of Krisp et al.,24 who identified 2850 proteins, a 1.4-fold increase
in protein identifications was achieved ion our study using DCM. Considering
proteins identified with at least one unique peptide per protein (n = 4801 ± 79, Figure S-10), even a 1.7-fold increase in protein identification was achieved
in our study using DCM. Compared to the study of Magdeldin et al.,9 who identified 4636 proteins, a higher number
of protein identifications was achieved in DCM (n = 4801 ± 79) with a 20-fold lower sample amount. In addition,
the number of identified proteins achieved in this study using DCM
(n = 4801 ± 79) was higher compared to the number
of proteins identified by Rauniyar et al.26 (n = 4415 ± 69), who analyzed 50 μg
of digested human bronchial epithelial cells by online SCX-RP-MS/MS
in GCM with similar NH4Ac pulses also used in this study.
The application of DCM to the first separation dimension improves
the performance of online SCX-RP-MS/MS in terms sensitivity at the
protein level due to a significantly higher identification rate compared
to GCM.

The degree of reproducibility was considerably higher in
case of
DCM. While 79.5% of the proteins were identified in all replicates
using GCM, DCM provided a reproducibility rate of 87.1% (Figure S-11 A), and a higher number of proteins
were reproducibly and exclusively identified in DCM (n = 991) compared to GCM (n = 254, Figure S-11 B). A comparison of the number of identified unique
peptides per identified protein revealed that in DCM proteins were
identified with a higher number of unique peptides per protein compared
to GCM (Figure 6C).
In DCM, for 45% of the identified proteins, 5 or more unique peptides
were identified, and only 17% of the proteins were identified based
on one unique peptide. In GCM, 26% of the proteins were identified
based on 1 unique peptide, and 30% of the identified proteins were
identified based on 5 or more unique peptides. The higher number of
identified unique peptides per protein can explain the higher level
of reproducibility observed for reported protein intensities in DCM
compared to those in GCM (Figure 5). The reported protein intensities were calculated
based on the intensities of the identified unique peptides. Thus,
a higher number of identified unique peptides per protein provides
a more accurate and reproducible calculation of protein intensities,
which is beneficial and of great importance for differential proteomics
in general.

The better peptide separation in DCM and the associated
increase
in peptide identifications resulted in a significantly higher average
protein sequence coverage in DCM (27.12%, ±0.2) compared to GCM
(20.39%, ±0.44, Figure 6B). The number of proteins, for which a higher sequence coverage
was obtained, was significantly higher in case of DCM compared to
GCM (DCM>: n = 1877 ± 47, GCM>: n = 376 ± 38, Figure S-12).

The average protein sequence coverage obtained in this study
using
GCM is consistent with the results obtained by Rauniyar et al.,26 who obtained an average protein sequence coverage
of 22.02% for human bronchial epithelial cells using online SCX-RP-MS/MS
in GCM with similar NH4Ac pulses also used in this study.
The significantly higher protein sequence coverages obtained in DCM
can be of interest for applications such as proteogenomics, where
it is important to have high protein sequence coverages to identify
genetic variability leading to protein sequence changes such as single
amino acid variants and splice-junction peptides.27,28

Conclusions
This work reports on
an improved online SCX-RP-MS/MS approach for
the analysis of complex proteomes. The online SCX-RP-MS/MS system
combines SCX chromatography in displacement chromatography mode (DCM)
in the first dimension of separation and RP chromatography in the
second dimension of separation. Applying DCM to the first dimension
of separation appeared to have several advantages for analyzing complex
peptide mixtures compared to conventionally used salt-based gradient
chromatography mode (GCM).

First, DCM provided a better separation
of peptides according to
their charge states. Due to the formation of a displacement train
during elution in DCM, peptides were separated from each other in
remarkably sharp zones with a low degree of coelution. In particular,
peptides with a charge state of +2 were separated over several fractions,
which was not possible to achieve in GCM because the elution strength
of ammonium acetate was insufficient to form a displacement train.
This is of particular relevance for proteome analysis because peptides
with a charge state of +2 represents the majority of complex proteomes
after tryptic digestion. The better separation in DCM provided significantly
higher identification rates at the peptide level and at the protein
level, thus improving the performance of online SCX-RP-MS/MS in terms
of detectability. Especially for peptides with a charge state of +2,
a 2.6-fold increase in identifications was achieved in DCM.

Second, the higher number of identified peptides in DCM significantly
increased the sequence coverage of the identified proteins and the
number of identified unique peptides per protein. These results are
beneficial for both differential proteomics and application such as
proteogenomics. For differential proteomics, because the higher number
of identified unique peptides per protein will provide more accurate
and reproducible quantitative results. For proteogenomics, because
high protein sequence coverages are necessary to identify genetic
variability leading to changes within the protein sequence.

Third, the use of DCM in the first dimension of separation is an
almost salt-free online SCX-RP-MS/MS approach, with the exception
of the last pulse, which is used to recondition the SCX column. Thus,
the application of DCM to the first separation dimension provides
an excellent compatibility with downstream RP-LC-MS/MS analysis. Altogether,
the reported online SCX-RP-MS/MS approach applying DCM to the first
dimension of separation provided remarkably high peptide separation
efficiencies, allowing for a sensitive and comprehensive analysis
of complex proteomes in the range of a few micrograms.
