The
first small-molecule fluorogenic probe A1 for imaging the human Ether-a-go-go-Related
Gene (hERG) potassium channel based on the photoinduced electron transfer
(PET) off–on mechanism was described herein. After careful
biological evaluation, this probe had the potential of detecting and
imaging the hERG channel at the molecular and cellular level. Moreover,
the competitive binding mechanism of this probe would presumably minimize
the effects on the electrophysiological properties of the hERG channel.
Therefore, this probe may serve as a powerful toolkit to the hERG-associated
study.

==== Body
Human Ether-a-go-go-Related
Gene (hERG) encodes the main subunit of the rapid rectifier potassium
channel that plays a critical role in the repolarization phase of
cardiac action potential.1 Mutation in
the hERG gene can result in severe inherit long QT syndrome (LQTS-2).2 Blocking the hERG channel can prolong the action
potential duration, which has been applied to treat ventricular tachycardia.
However, presently, more and more nonantiarrythmic drugs were found
to be associated with acquired long QT syndrome, such as antibiotics
(sufisomezole), antipsychotics (chlorpromazine), antihistamine (terfenadine),
gastric motility drugs (cisapride), and so on.3,4 Subsequent
research found that these drugs have high affinity with hERG potassium
channel, which contributes to their arrhythmogenic side effect. Currently,
FDA requires that all drugs should assay the affinity with hERG channel
so as to evaluate their cardiotoxicity. In addition, hERG channel
is also expressed in neural tissues, pancreas, smooth muscle,2 liver, and other tissues.5−7 In tumors derived
from these types of tissues, such as endometrial cancer, colorectal
cancer, and neuroblastoma, the expression of hERG channel is up-regulated
and is regarded to facilitate cell proliferation, invasion, and tumor
angiogenesis.8 Therefore, the hERG channel
may be a potential tumor biomarker for diagnostic purposes.

To aid in better analysis and molecular imaging of the hERG channel,
several methods have been developed in recent years, including immunofluorescence
and fluorescent protein-based techniques.9−11 During immunofluorescent
manipulation, cells have died and it could record a cell at a certain
time without temporal resolution. Fluorescent protein-based technique
involves complicated, expensive, and time-consuming procedures by
conjugating a fluorescent protein as the reporter. Moreover, it has
been reported that fluorophore conjugation to the channel often affects
the electrophysiological properties.12 As
a result, there is an urgent need for developing a convenient method
to aid both molecular imaging and mechanistic dissection of the hERG
channel.

Fluorescence-based techniques, such as small molecule
fluorescent probes, fluorescent protein based methods, and quantum
dot-based approaches, have been well developed since the first description
of fluorescence phenomenon in 1575. Among these techniques, small
molecule fluorescent probes, for its unique advantages including high
sensitivity, low cost, and convenient operation have been widely used
in high-throughput screening for identification of drug candidates,
biotarget (protein, DNA, RNA, H2S, H2O2, and others) detection, and imaging.13,14 In addition,
small molecule fluorescent probes can observe the biotarget in a living
state and provide dynamic information at spatial and temporal resolution,
thereby expanding the repertoire of chemical toolkits that are useful
for biological study and medical diagnosis.

Until now, there
is only one report that describes the use of small molecule fluorescent
probes for hERG channels on the basis of dofetilide.15 This probe has been applied to establish the high-throughput
screening assay for hERG inhibitors based on the fluorescence polarization
(FP) assay. Meanwhile, there are several other small molecule potential
sensitive probes for indirectly detecting the hERG channel, such as
DiSBAC4(3), DiSBAC2(3), CC2-DMPE/DiSBAC2(3), CC2-DMPE/DiSBAC4(3),
FMP dye, as well as probes for detecting Tl+, a K+ analogue.16−18 Although these probes have been applied in high-throughput
screening, their low sensitivity often hampers further mechanistic
studies. Therefore, in the current study, we undertake an effort on
developing a small molecule fluorescent probe that may provide a convenient
strategy to image the hERG channel. After careful selection, azimilide,
a classical hERG channel inhibitor, was herein selected as the pharmacophore
group to develop a small molecule fluorescent probe for hERG channel
imaging.

It should be noted that an ideal small molecule fluorescent
probe should have an off–on effect, which can reduce the background
signal. Until now, a series of fluorescence turn-on mechanisms have
been well developed, such as photoinduced electron transfer (PET),
intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and fluorescence resonance energy
transfer (FRET).19,20 In 2004, the Koide group reported
a 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorophore derivation, which can
form a intramolecular PET effect on the nitrogen atom in the piperazine
ring as the electron donor (or quencher).21,22 In a free state, the probe adopts a closed conformation in which
the nitrogen atom was brought in proximity to the xanthene ring, and
the fluorescence is quenched through the PET effect. Upon binding
the target molecules, this closed conformation is destroyed and the
distance between the nitrogen atom and the xanthene ring is expanded,
which disables the PET quenching, and the fluorescence was recovered
simultaneously. By using this turn-on mechanism, the Qian group developed
a selective fluorogenic probe for detecting carbonic anhydrase IX
(CA IX).23 Inspired by this strategy, we
set out to apply this off/on mechanism for designing a fluorescent
probe for the hERG channel (Scheme 1A,B). Moreover,
this is also the reason why we chose azimilide as the recognition
motif, in which there is a piperazine substructure as the quenching
group. However, our approach differs from their design since the quencher
motif in our probe is part of the recognition structure and involved
in the binding with the target, which may facilitate to destroy the
PET effect.

Scheme 1 Design Strategies of a Small Molecule Fluorescent
Probe for hERG Channel Imaging (A and B) and the Synthetic Route of
Probe A1
Subsequently, probe
A1 was synthesized as shown in Scheme 1C. In
brief, the azimilide recognition motif and the 2,7-dichlorofluorescein
(DCF) fluorophore derivation were prepared as previously described
(Scheme S1 in the Supporting Information).22,24 The recognition moiety was incorporated
with fluorophore through a Mannich reaction. After obtaining the probe
A1, we evaluated the inhibitory activity against hERG using a radio-ligand
competitive binding assay. The results demonstrated that probe A1
displayed good inhibitory effects against the hERG channel, and the
calculated IC50 and Ki values are 1.60 and 0.801 μM, respectively, which are
comparable to azimilide (1.91 and 0.954 μM, see Table 1), while atropine exhibits no activity.

As described above, the nitrogen atom in our
probe structure was proposed to form a PET quenching with the fluorophore.
Therefore, with the increased concentration of target protein, this
PET quenching effect may be destroyed to release the fluorescence.
To confirm this, a series of concentrations of hERG-transfected HEK293
cell membrane was incubated with the same concentration of probe A1
(5 μM). As anticipated, fluorescence intensity was gradually
enhanced with increased membrane concentrations (Figure 1A,B). When incubated with 1 mg/mL membrane, the fluorescence
intensity presented was approximately 2.5-fold higher than that of
the blank group.

Figure 1 (A) Fluorescent emission spectra of 5 μM probe A1
incubated with different concentrations of membrane (1.6, 0.8, 0.4,
0.2, and 0 mg/mL) for 20–30 min in the assay buffer (50 mM
Tris-HCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl) at room temperature. (B)
The corresponding fluorescent intensity changes at 544 nm with increased
membrane concentration (λex = 490 nm).

Afterward, the selectivity of fluorescent intensity
enhancement of probe A1 was examined, in which bovine serum albumin
(BSA) and trypsin were selected as negative controls because that
they can easily form a nonspecific binding with small molecules. Probe
A1 (5 μM) was incubated with these different proteins or hERG-transfected
HEK293 cell membrane at the same concentration (1 mg/mL). The experimental
results demonstrated that no discernible fluorescence increase for
trypsin was detected. However, there is a certain degree of increase
for BSA, which indicted that probe A1 may form some nonspecific binding
with BSA. When treated with hERG-transfected HEK293 cell membrane,
probe A1 exhibited a higher fluorescence response over other proteins.
Specifically, the selectivity of this probe for hERG-transfected HEK293
cell membrane is more than 2.5-fold over trypsin and the blank control
and 1.5-fold over BSA (Figure 2). In addition,
the fluorescence enhancement of probes incubated with hERG-transfected
HEK293 cell membranes can be obviously decreased (P < 0.01) by a hERG inhibitor, astemizole. However, this fluorescence
enhancement cannot be completely suppressed, which may be caused by
the unavoidable nonspecific binding with other proteins in the membrane.

Figure 2 (A) Fluorescent
emission spectra of 5 μM probe A1 incubated with 1 mg/mL of
different proteins or membrane (trypsin, BSA, and hERG-transfected
HEK293 cell membrane in the presence or absence of 5 μM astermizole)
for 20–30 min in assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl) at room temperature (λex = 490
nm, λem = 544 nm). (B) The corresponding fluorescent
intensity changes of 5 μM probe A1 at 544 nm incubated with
1 mg/mL trypsin, BSA, and hERG-transfected HEK293 cell membrane in
the presence or absence of 5 μM astermizole. ∗∗
< 0.001, ∗ < 0.01 (t-test, calculated by GraphPad Prism
software).

In addition to the radio-ligand
competitive binding assay, a fluorescence polarization assay was performed
to evaluate the binding affinity of probe A1 with the hERG channel.
The results demonstrated that probe A1 exhibited a highly sensitive
response to the hERG channel at both the 1 μM and 5 μM
concentrations. Meanwhile, when treated with 1 mg/mL cell membrane,
the FP value can have a dose-dependent enhancement and the calculated Kd value is 0.14 ± 0.03 μM (Figure 3).

Figure 3 (A) Fluorescence polarization (FP) assay used to monitor
the interaction between probe A1 (1 μM and 5 μM) and the
cell membrane; (B) fluorescent polarization value changes with the
increase of probe A1 concentration at 1.2 mg/mL cell membrane (λem = 520 nm, λex = 485 nm).

In parallel, encouraged by the data described above,
we further explored the feasibility of applying this probe to image
hERG channels in living cells. The hERG-transfected and wild-type
HEK293 cells were selected as positive and negative groups, respectively.
The cell imaging (performed in a Zeiss Axio Observer A1 fluorescent
microscope) results revealed that probe A1 selectively could label
hERG-transfected HEK293 cells (Figure 4A1–B2),
while a significant reduction in fluorescence staining was observed
in cell imaging upon competition with 20-fold excess of Astermizole,
a potent hERG channel inhibitor (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). In view of the hERG channel as a
membrane protein, hERG-transfected HEK293 cells were costained with
a commercial membrane dye (DID red dye) (Figure 4C1,C2). The confocal imaging data revealed that probe A1 stained
the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells transfected with hERG channels,
as indicated by the PM-localized dye DID (red, Figure 4C1,C2). The calculated degree of colocalization, as quantified
by the Pearson’s correlation coefficient using ImageJ software,
is 0.85. In addition to its localization in the cell membrane, a portion
of expressed hERG channel protein was retained in the cytoplasm, which
corresponds to the reported results of fluorescent protein-based method
as well.11

Small molecule fluorescent probes
have a broad application in the interrogation and mechanistic study
of a myriad of biological processes. It is becoming an indispensable
tool for biological research. However, there is few highly sensitive
and selective small molecule fluorescent probes for ion channel detection.25,26 In this letter, we designed and synthesized a selective fluorescent
probe for imaging the hERG channel at the molecular and cellular level.
To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the few examples of an
“off–on” selective fluorescent probe for potassium
channels. Compared with immunofluorescent and fluorescent protein
based approaches, this fluorogenic imaging method is rapid, simple,
economic, and more importantly, it can also observe the hERG channel
in living and intact cells. In addition, this probe adopted a competitive
binding mechanism, which would presumably minimize the effects on
the electrophysiological properties of the hERG channel. Therefore,
this probe may serve as a powerful tool to the hERG-associated study.

Enzyme and small active molecules can utilize their catalytic or
reactive activity to design a turn-on fluorogenic mechanism. However,
for those biotargets with no catalytic activity, such as GPCRs, ion
channels, DNAs and RNAs, how to branch out a fluorescent turn-on probe
is still challenging. In the present study, the conformational alteration-directed
PET turn-on mechanism may provide a “light-up” example
for these types of biotargets without catalytic or reactive activity.
On the basis of these interesting results, more efforts will be undertaken
toward developing further improved hERG fluorogenic probes in our
laboratory.
