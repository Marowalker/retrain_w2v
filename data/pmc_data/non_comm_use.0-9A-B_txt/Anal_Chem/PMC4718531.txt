Microelectrodes
modified with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are useful
for the detection of neurotransmitters because the CNTs enhance sensitivity
and have electrocatalytic effects. CNTs can be grown on carbon fiber
microelectrodes (CFMEs) but the intrinsic electrochemical activity
of carbon fibers makes evaluating the effect of CNT enhancement difficult.
Metal wires are highly conductive and many metals have no intrinsic
electrochemical activity for dopamine, so we investigated CNTs grown
on metal wires as microelectrodes for neurotransmitter detection.
In this work, we successfully grew CNTs on niobium substrates for
the first time. Instead of planar metal surfaces, metal wires with
a diameter of only 25 μm were used as CNT substrates; these
have potential in tissue applications due to their minimal tissue
damage and high spatial resolution. Scanning electron microscopy shows
that aligned CNTs are grown on metal wires after chemical vapor deposition.
By use of fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, CNT-coated niobium (CNT-Nb)
microelectrodes exhibit higher sensitivity and lower ΔEp value compared to CNTs grown on carbon fibers
or other metal wires. The limit of detection for dopamine at CNT-Nb
microelectrodes is 11 ± 1 nM, which is approximately 2-fold lower
than that of bare CFMEs. Adsorption processes were modeled with a
Langmuir isotherm, and detection of other neurochemicals was also
characterized, including ascorbic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic
acid, serotonin, adenosine, and histamine. CNT-Nb microelectrodes
were used to monitor stimulated dopamine release in anesthetized rats
with high sensitivity. This study demonstrates that CNT-grown metal
microelectrodes, especially CNTs grown on Nb microelectrodes, are
useful for monitoring neurotransmitters.

==== Body
Carbon nanotube (CNT)-modified
electrodes have been widely used for the detection of biomolecules
because of their unique properties including large active surface
area, high conductivity, fast electron transfer kinetics, and biocompatibility.1,2 These properties lead to reduced overpotential, minimal electrode
fouling, and increased sensitivity and selectivity.3,4 CNTs
are especially attractive for making smaller electrodes because the
high surface-area-to-volume ratio results in a large electroactive
surface area for the adsorption of biomolecules.5 A popular method to deposit CNT films onto microelectrodes
is to dip carbon fiber microelectrodes (CFMEs) into CNT suspension
or CNT/polymer composite solution.6−9 However, CNTs are randomly distributed throughout
the CNT films during the dip coating process. Therefore, most of the
area exposed to the analyte solution is the sidewall of the CNTs,
but the ends of the CNTs are more likely to be the most electrochemically
active sites.10−13 Moreover, large CNT agglomerations are easily formed, which cause
high noise, and the cumbersome fabrication procedure reduces reproducibility.7

Previous studies have shown that vertically
aligned CNTs on a microelectrode
substrate are better for detecting neurotransmitters, such as dopamine.14 One strategy is to chemically self-assemble
vertically aligned CNTs on substrates with a solution deposition method.
Our group developed single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) forest-modified
CFMEs for rapid and sensitive detection of neurotransmitters by use
of fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV).15 An alternative strategy is to directly grow CNTs in an aligned manner
through chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Recently, Xiang et al.16 used as-synthesized, vertically aligned carbon
nanotube sheathed carbon fibers (VACNT-CFs) for the detection of dopamine
and ascorbate in vivo. The VACNT-CFs microelectrodes exhibited promising
electrochemical performance. However, since the carbon fiber is electrochemically
active toward dopamine, the CF substrates limit studies of the properties
of CNT coating. In comparison, metal substrates with CNT coating would
have several benefits. First, although gold17 and platinum18 are active to dopamine,
many other metals (e.g., Nb, Ta, Mo, W, Pd, Ti, and stainless steel
used in this paper) lack electrochemical reactivity to dopamine, which
enables the study of interaction of dopamine with CNTs without the
convolution of possible substrate reactivity. Second, the inherently
low conductivity of CF10 may limit the
overall conductivity of sensors, while metals have higher conductivity.
Third, the electrochemical properties of the CF core vary with different
waveforms and can affect the electrochemical properties.19 Therefore, a metal substrate that lacks reactivity
to dopamine and has high intrinsic conductivity and relatively stable
electrochemistry may avoid these issues. Although successful growth
of CNTs on several metal substrates has been reported,20−26 CNTs have not been grown on niobium (Nb) substrates. In addition,
all previous studies of CNT growth on metals have been on flat substrates
and not on the cylindrical metal wires that would be needed for implantable
electrochemical microsensors.

In this study, we explored the
use of CNT-grown metal microelectrodes
for enhanced neurotransmitter detection. The CNT-grown metal microelectrodes
and CFMEs were fabricated by CVD and characterized by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy. These are the first studies
to grow CNTs on Nb substrates or on small-diameter metal wires, instead
of a planar metal surfaces such as foils, which allows them to be
implanted in tissue with minimal damage and high spatial resolution.27 CNTs grown on Nb were short and dense, and CNT-Nb
microelectrodes exhibited better electrochemical response to dopamine
via FSCV compared to CNTs grown on other metals or CFs. Moreover,
the CNT-Nb microelectrodes were tested for electrochemical response
to ascorbic acid, DOPAC (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, a dopamine
metabolite), serotonin, adenosine, and histamine. The CNT-Nb microelectrodes
were used to detect stimulated dopamine release in anesthetized rats
and exhibited high sensitivity with rapid measurements in vivo. Electrophysiology
studies often use arrays of metal wires, and future experiments could
investigate making arrays of the CNTs on metal wires for multiplexed
electrochemical experiments.

Experimental Section
Synthesis of Carbon Nanotube-Coated
Metal Wires and Carbon Fibers
Carbon fibers (T650-35, Cytec,
Woodland Park, NJ) and metal wires
including tantalum, niobium, molybdenum, tungsten, stainless steel,
titanium, and palladium (diameter 0.001 in.; ESPI Metals, Ashland,
OR) were used as electrode substrates. CNTs were grown in an aligned
manner through CVD after a solid-phase catalyst was deposited on the
substrate surface.24,28 A thin film of Al2O3 (30 nm) followed by a film of Fe catalyst (1 nm) was
deposited onto the metal wires (25 μm) or CFs (7 μm) by
electron beam physical vapor deposition (Angstrom Engineering, Kitchener,
Ontario, Canada). Since electron beam deposition is “line-of-sight”
dependent, only one side of the substrate was coated with buffer layer
and catalyst. As a result, the microelectrodes were half coated with
CNT arrays. In a quartz tube CVD reactor, the Al2O3–Fe-coated CFs and metal wires were degassed in vacuum
and the temperature of the reactor was slowly ramped up to 700 °C
and held for 10 min with a flow mixture of Argon (2000 sccm) and H2 (200 sccm). Then ethylene (10 sccm) was introduced through
the quartz tube for 5 min to grow the CNTs.

Langmuir Isotherm Modeling
We used a Langmuir adsorption
isotherm (eq 1) to model
the adsorption and desorption process kinetics of dopamine: 1  ΓDA is the amount of dopamine
adsorbed on the electrode, Γs is the saturated amount
of dopamine that can adsorb on the electrode, βDA is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant (unitless) for dopamine,
and aDAb is the activity of dopamine in bulk solution at equilibrium.
The percent surface coverage, ΓDA/Γs, can be expressed by the ratio of oxidation current of dopamine
to theoretical saturated oxidation current, which is the plateau of
the fitting curve. The activity is related to its molar concentration
(CDA) by eq 2:29 2  γDA is the activity coefficient
of dopamine in bulk solution at the adsorption equilibrium. For a
charged adsorbate solution at high concentration, the effect of the
activity coefficients must be taken into account because charged adsorbates
are governed by ionic interactions.30 According
to the Debye–Huckel law: 3  γDA is a function
of ionic
strength (I) of the solute and charge carried by
each solute (z), while A is a constant
that depends on temperature and is about 0.51 for water at 25 °C.31 Thus, γDA for dopamine in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) is 0.63 at room temperature.32 βDA can be used to calculate the adsorption Gibbs
free energy of dopamine (eq 4): 4  

Results
and Discussion
Characterization of Carbon Nanotubes Grown
on Metal Wires and
Carbon Fibers
CVD allows direct growth of CNTs on substrates;
however, no study had grown CNTs on Nb or on small-diameter cylindrical
metal wires. We optimized CNT growth on metal wires for use as microelectrodes. Figure 1 shows SEM images
of bare Nb (Figure 1A) and Ta (Figure 1B) wires as well as carbon fiber (Figure 1C) and the same substrates after CNT growth
(Figure 1 D–F).
The CNTs (multiwalled) grown on Nb are short, dense, and aligned,
compared to the CNTs grown on Ta and CFs, which are longer and more
randomly oriented. Since the end-caps of the CNTs would be open due
to the applied voltage,33 the ends would
have more sp3-hybridized, edge plane carbons that can be
oxidized to provide functional groups.10 The short, dense CNT bundles on the Nb would have more functionalized
edge plane sites exposed compared to the more diffuse CNTs on CFs
and Ta, where more sidewalls would be exposed to the analyte.

Scale bar: 500 nm.

The variety in CNT morphology
grown on different metallic substrates
might result from the interaction of Al2O3 buffer
layer with the substrate or different properties of the metals. Al2O3 was used as a catalyst support buffer layer
to enhance CNT growth by inhibiting diffusion of the catalyst material
into the substrate upon heating.34 However,
the Al2O3 buffer layer has a different grain
size on different substrates after heating, due to surface energy
or wettability,35−37 which leads to different CNT nucleation densities.38 Another possible reason for the varied CNT morphology
on different substrates is the amount of hydrogen absorbed in the
metal substrates, which could affect the microstructure and mechanical
properties of the resulting CNT gowth.39 Among transition metals, group VB metals are good hydrogen storage
substrates.40−42 Therefore, the more aligned and consistent CNT growth
on Nb and Ta might be due to hydrogen release that helps maintain
the activation of iron catalysts.

To further characterize the CNT
surface, Raman spectra of CNTs
grown on metal wires and CF substrates were compared (Figure S1). The ratio of D/G peaks (D band originating
from defects and G band from graphite) reveals the sp3-hybridized
content of the carbon film.43 The D/G ratios
(n = 5) for CNT-Nb, CNT-Ta, and CNT-CF are 2.2 ±
0.1, 1.8 ± 0.2, and 1.9 ± 0.6, respectively. The ratio of
intensities of these peaks is often used as an indicator of the quality
of CNTs, and these multiwalled CNTs are defect-rich.44 The D/G ratio of CNTs grown on Nb is significantly larger
than on Ta (unpaired t test, p ≤
0.05), which demonstrates CNTs on Nb are more defect-rich. The small
standard errors observed indicate that the D/G ratio was consistent
between electrodes.

Fast-Scan Cyclic Voltammetry of Dopamine
at Bare Metal Wire
and Carbon Fiber Microelectrodes
To investigate the electrochemical
performance of the substrate materials, cylindrical microelectrodes
were made of metal wires and carbon fibers. Figure 2A–C shows the background current measured
in PBS at bare Nb, Ta, and CF electrodes with similar lengths (∼70–100
μm). The capacitive currents arising from electrical double
layer charging are small, around 300 nA for Nb and 100 nA for Ta metal
wires. The square shape background for Nb and Ta metal wires reveals
good polarizability.10 In contrast, background
currents at CFME can be attributed to surface functional groups as
well as capacitive charging.45

rate of 400 V/s and repetition frequency of 10 Hz. (Left) Background
current in PBS solution for (A) niobium, (B) tantalum, and (C) carbon

carbon fiber microelectrodes.

Figure 2D–F
shows the background-subtracted cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of 1 μM
dopamine at bare Nb, Ta, and CF microelectrodes. Nb and Ta are not
electrochemically active for dopamine and show no Faradaic peaks.
Therefore, any dopamine signal at CNT-Nb or CNT-Ta microelectrodes
will arise from the CNTs. CFMEs have a robust signal for dopamine
(Figure 2F) and are
widely used as the standard electrode material in the field of in
vivo voltammetry.

Fast-Scan Cyclic Voltammetry of Dopamine
at Carbon Nanotube-Grown
Metal Wire and Carbon Fiber Microelectrodes
Figure 3 shows the electrochemical
response of CNT-grown Nb and Ta microelectrodes and CNT-grown CFMEs.
The background charging currents for CNT-Nb and CNT-Ta electrodes
(Figure 3A,B) are significantly
larger than for the bare metals (Figure 2A,B), indicating substantial CNT growth.
For CNTs grown on Nb and Ta wires, background-subtracted CVs for 1
μM dopamine (Figure 3D,E) show Faradaic peaks that were not present for bare wires
(Figure 2D,E). Faradaic
peaks for dopamine are also observed at CNT-CF microelectrodes, but
the contribution of CNTs versus that of CF to the signal is harder
to distinguish. Moreover, dopamine oxidation is more reversible at
CNT-Nb microelectrodes than for CFMEs, which can be observed in the
CVs.

Figure 3 Comparison of electrochemical response at CNT-grown niobium, tantalum,
and carbon fiber microelectrodes: background current at (A) CNT-Nb,
(B) CNT-Ta, and (C) CNT-CF and background-subtracted cyclic voltammograms
for 1 μM dopamine at (D) CNT-Nb, (E) CNT-Ta, and (F) CNT-CF
microelectrodes. Measurements were taken after (—) 15 min and
(---) 160 min of equilibration in PBS solution with a waveform of
−0.4 to 1.3 V and back at 400 V/s, 10 Hz.

Equilibration at carbon-based electrodes is required, since
the
carbon surface can change with application of the triangle waveform.
Equilibration with a fast-scan triangle waveform (400 V/s, −0.4
to 1.3 V vs Ag/AgCl) mildly etches the carbon surface and introduces
more oxygen-containing functional groups as active adsorption sites
for dopamine.45 For CNT-grown microelectrodes,
the background (Figure 3A–C) and response to 1 μM dopamine (Figure 3D–F) were measured at
two equilibration time points: waveform application for 15 and 160
min. Equilibration time mattered little for CNT-Nb microelectrodes,
as the response to dopamine and background current were similar for
both time points (Figure S2A). In contrast,
CNT-Ta and CNT-CF required a longer equilibration time (Figure S2B,C). The shorter equilibration time
might be due to abundant defect sites at CNT grown on Nb, which could
be oxygen-functionalized faster by electrochemical activation.46 The ends of CNTs grown on Nb are likely open,
especially after continuous scanning with the 1.3 V triangle waveform,
while the main sources of adsorption sites at CNT-Ta and CNT-CF are
probably defects on sidewalls. The CNT-Nb microelectrode had no significant
change in peak oxidative current for dopamine over 4 h, indicating
the electrodes are stable over the typical time length of a biological
experiment (Figure S3).

To compare
the sensitivity of electrodes to dopamine, currents
were corrected for surface area (based on their capacitive charging
currents), since the metal wires are 25 μm in diameter while
the CFME is 7 μm. As shown in Table 1, the current density at CNT-Nb microelectrodes
for 1 μM dopamine is 197 ± 16 pA/μm2,
which is significantly larger than the current density at CNT-Ta,
CNT-CF, or CFMEs [one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) Bonferroni
post-test, p < 0.0005, n = 5].
Current density at CFMEs after CNT growth is lower than that for bare
CFMEs, indicating that much of CNT grown on the CF substrate is not
as electrochemically active as CF to dopamine. Because of the spaghettilike
structure, not all of the CNTs on the CF may be available for electron
transfer, but adding CNTs adds to the background current and noise.
The limit of detection (LOD) is 11 ± 1 nM (S/N = 3) for dopamine
at CNT-Nb microelectrodes, which is significantly lower than those
at CNT-Ta, CNT-CF, and CFMEs (one-way ANOVA Bonferroni post-test, p < 0.005, n = 5). Therefore, with higher
sensitivity and better LOD than CFMEs, CNT-Nb electrodes show promising
electrochemical performance for dopamine detection.

Table 1 also gives
the average values of oxidation and reduction peak separation of dopamine
(ΔEp) for CNT-grown metal wire microelectrodes
and CFME. The ΔEp values are significantly
lower at CNT-Nb (one-way ANOVA Bonferroni post-test, p < 0.01, n = 5), yielding a peak separation that
is ∼140 and ∼80 mV lower than those of CNT-Ta and CNT-CF
microelectrodes, respectively. The smaller ΔEp at CNT-Nb microelectrode might be caused by differing
double-layer capacitances, uncompensated resistance, or ohmic drop.5 However, because both the electrolyte and the
size of the electrodes are similar, ohmic drop is an unlikely cause.
Álvarez-Martos et al.14 found that
electron transfer was faster through oriented forestlike CNTs than
nonoriented spaghettilike CNTs. The CNT-Nb morphology is denser and
shorter than in CNT-Ta and CNT-CF, and the ends of the tubes are likely
to have exposed defect sites for electron transfer. The mass transport
per defect would be lower at CNT-Nb, based on the theory of charge
transfer at partially blocked surfaces.47 The larger number of active sites results in reduced diffusional
flux per active site, which may also be the cause of smaller ΔEp. In addition, there may be restricted mass
transfer between the longer CNTs in spaghettilike CNT grown on Ta
and CF. The overall ΔEp at CNT-Nb
microelectrodes is larger than at CFMEs, which shows that there are
likely multiple factors affecting electron transfer, and the rate
is also likely depressed by slow transfer through the Al2O3 buffer layer.

Characterization of Other Metal Substrates
for Carbon Nanotube
Growth
Other metal wires were tested for growing CNTs, including
molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), palladium (Pd), stainless steel (SS),
and titanium (Ti). Figure S4 shows the
SEM images of both bare metals and CNT-grown metals. Larger CNT structures
are apparent on W, Pd, SS, and Ti. On Pd, the carbon nanomaterial
is larger in diameter and appears to be amorphous carbon, not CNTs.
Moreover, CNTs grown on these metals are less dense than the CNTs
grown on Nb, Ta, and CF. Background currents at these bare metal wires
were approximately 3–10 times larger (Figure S5A–E) than at bare Nb and Ta microelectrodes (Figure 2A,B). None of the
bare metals was electrochemically active toward dopamine (Figure S5F–J). After CNT growth, Mo, W,
SS, and Ti do not have the typical characteristic peaks for dopamine
even after 160 min of equilibration (Figure S6). Carbon-coated Pd shows electrochemical activity to dopamine (Figure S6H), which is likely due to the amorphous
carbon grown on Pd wires.

Our studies showed that the size of
CNTs and the amount of growth depended on the metal substrate. CNT-Nb
microelectrodes are preferred for neurotransmitter detection due to
the short, dense, and vertically aligned CNT coating, which leads
to high current density, low LOD, fast electron transfer rate, and
short equilibration time. Thus, CNT-Nb microelectrodes were used for
in vivo characterization studies.

Langmuir Isotherm Modeling
The redox reaction of dopamine
at the surface of carbon-based sensors is an adsorption-controlled
process.48 Using a model for FSCV data
developed by the Wightman group,49 we previously
determined that the adsorption/desorption kinetics of dopamine are
different for CNT yarn electrodes than for CFMEs.50 Here, we used a Langmuir adsorption isotherm to model the
adsorption and desorption kinetics of dopamine at CNT-grown electrodes.
The percent surface coverage is calculated from eq 1 and then the coverage versus concentration
is fit with the Langmuir isotherm. The anodic peak (Figure 4) and the cathodic peak (Figure S7) give information about dopamine and
dopamine-o-quinone (DOQ) adsorption, respectively. Table 2 gives average adsorption
rate constants for CNT-Nb, CNT-Ta, and CNT-CF microelectrodes as well
as bare CFME. The β value is used to calculate the Gibbs free
energy for dopamine and DOQ adsorption.

Figure 4 Plot of
normalized anodic current to corresponding dopamine concentration.
The fitting curve is modeled on the basis of eq 3, where CDA is
the x-axis and fractional surface coverage is the y-axis. An equilibrium value, βDA, is fit
for each curve. (A) CNT-coated Nb microelectrode; (B) CNT-coated Ta

The adsorption equilibria for both dopamine (βDA) and DOQ (βDOQ) at CNT-Nb and CNT-Ta microelectrodes
are smaller than those at CF and CNT-CF microelectrodes. This indicates
dopamine and DOQ adsorb more strongly to CF and CNT-CF microelectrodes
than to CNT-Nb and CNT-Ta microelectrodes. However, at the CNT-Ta
and CNT-Nb microelectrodes, βDA is similar to βDOQ, and the ratio of βDA/βDOQ is about 1 (Table 2). At CFMEs, βDA is significantly larger than βDOQ (paired t test, p <
0.005, n = 5), and the βDA/βDOQ ratio is larger than at CNT-Nb microelectrodes (unpaired t test, p < 0.05, n = 5). Thus, DOQ
is more likely to readsorb from the electrode at CNT-Nb, leading to
a bigger reduction peak and more reversible reaction. The ratio of
equilibrium constants for CNT-CF microelectrodes falls in between
that of CFMEs and CNT-grown wires. The overall equilibrium is likely
a convolution of the equilibrium at CNT-coated parts of the electrode
and bare CFME, which is also partially exposed to solution. These
data agree with previous modeling of CNT yarn electrodes, which showed
differences in adsorption for dopamine and DOQ compared to CFMEs.50

Fast-Scan Cyclic Voltammetry of Other Neurochemicals
We tested the electrochemical performance of CNT-Nb microelectrodes
toward the detection of other neurochemicals including ascorbic acid
(AA), DOPAC (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid), serotonin, adenosine,
and histamine. Since the detection of adenosine and histamine requires
scanning to higher potentials, we used a waveform of −0.4 V
to 1.45 V at 400 V/s.51Figure 5 shows sample CVs for each
neurochemical (black solid line) compared to dopamine (red dashed
line) at the same CNT-Nb electrode. The bar graphs compare the ratio
of oxidation currents of the different neurotransmitters to dopamine
at CNT-Nb microelectrodes and CFMEs.

microelectrodes. (Upper

serotonin, (G) 1 μM adenosine, and (I) 1 μM histamine
in PBS buffer. Red dashed line is CV of 1 μM dopamine obtained
from the same CNT-Nb electrode. For AA, DOPAC, and serotonin, the
electrode was scanned to 1.3 V; for adenosine and histamine, the electrode
was scanned to 1.45 V. (Lower row) Column plots show the ratio of
oxidation current for (B) 200 μM AA, (D) 20 μM DOPAC,
(F) 1 μM serotonin, (H) 1 μM adenosine, and (J) 1 μM
histamine compared to the corresponding oxidation current of dopamine
at CNT-Nb microelectrode (black, n = 5) and CFMEs
(gray, n = 5). The oxidation current ratios at CNT-Nb
microelectrodes are significantly different than CFMEs for the measurement
of ascorbic acid (paired t test, p < 0.0001) and histamine (paired t test, p < 0.05).

Ascorbic acid is an anionic antioxidant present in high concentrations
in the brain,52 with a broad oxidation
peak near the potential for dopamine detection (Figure 5A). The ratios of oxidative current for 200
μM AA to 1 μM dopamine at CNT-Nb microelectrodes are significantly
smaller than those at CFMEs (Figure 5B, paired t test, p < 0.0001, n = 5), indicating CNT-Nb microelectrodes
have better selectivity for dopamine over AA than CFMEs. Since AA
is an anion at physiological pH,53 the
abundant oxygen-containing functional groups on the CNT surface might
repel AA and further increase the selectivity for cationic dopamine.
DOPAC is a dopamine metabolite54 and has
a similar oxidation potential to dopamine (Figure 5C). Although there is no significant difference
in selectivity for dopamine over DOPAC at CNT-Nb microelectrodes (Figure 5D, paired t test, p = 0.1454, n =
5), the reduction potential of DOPAC is significantly more negative
(−0.28 ± 0.01 V for DOPAC compared to −0.22 ±
0.01 V for dopamine; paired t test, p < 0.001, n = 5), similar to previous CNT electrode
studies.9 Serotonin is a cationic indolamine
neurotransmitter.55 The ratio of currents
for serotonin to dopamine is similar for CNT-Nb microelectrodes and
CFMEs (Figure 5F, paired t test, p = 0.3008, n =
5). The oxidation peak for serotonin is similar to that for dopamine
as well, but the reduction peak is shifted by 200 mV (Figure 6E, paired t test, p < 0.0001, n = 5), which
can be used to discriminate serotonin from dopamine. Adenosine is
an important neuroprotective modulator in the brain that regulates
neurotransmission and blood flow.51 Adenosine
is identified by its two oxidation peaks in the CV (a primary oxidation
peak at 1.4 V and a secondary peak at 1.0 V; Figure 5G).51 The selectivity
for adenosine compared to dopamine at CNT-Nb microelectrodes is similar
to that at CFMEs (Figure 5H, paired t test, p = 0.7476, n = 5). Histamine is a neurotransmitter that regulates sleep.56 CNT-Nb electrodes have an oxidation peak near
the switching potential (Figure 5I) and show significantly higher histamine to dopamine
current ratios than CFMEs (Figure 5J, paired t test, p < 0.05, n = 5), which might be due to the better
antifouling properties of the CNT surface toward histamine than CFMEs.57 Overall, CNT-Nb microelectrodes are useful for
detecting a variety of neurochemicals.

In Vivo Detection of Dopamine
at Carbon Nanotube-Grown Niobium
Microelectrodes
To determine the applicability of the CNT-Nb
microelectrode as a novel in vivo sensor, stimulated dopamine release
was measured in anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats. Stimulation
pulse trains were applied (300 μA, 12–120 pulses, 60
Hz) to the dopamine cell bodies, and the dopamine response was recorded
in the caudate putamen near the terminals. Figure 6A,B show sample CVs and current versus time
plots of dopamine detection at a CNT-Nb microelectrode with different
stimulation pulses. Current increased as dopamine was released during
the stimulation and decreased after the stimulation due to uptake.52Figure 6C gives the average dopamine concentration evoked in vivo;
released dopamine is still detectable with as low as 12 stimulation
pulses. The current density of the stimulated dopamine at CNT-Nb microelectrode
in vivo [0.15 ± 0.02 pA/(nM·μm2)] is slightly
lower than that in vitro [0.20 ± 0.02 pA/(nM·μm2)] but not significantly different (unpaired t test, p > 0.05), which indicates CNT-Nb microelectrodes
maintained relatively high sensitivity for in vivo dopamine detection.
The CV of dopamine in vivo has a larger ΔEp than that in vitro, likely due to adsorption of lipids, proteins,
and peptides present in the extracellular fluid that slow electron
transfer.58,59 While the larger ΔEp is not ideal, the sensitivity is maintained and the
CV could be matched to in vivo spontaneous release. However, future
studies could focus on in vivo studies of protein fouling and adopt
strategies that have been implemented for gold60 and carbon fiber microelectrodes61 to tune the surface adsorption of dopamine.

vivo at CNT-Nb microelectrodes. (A) Sample
CVs depicting stimulated dopamine release detected from a CNT-Nb microelectrode
placed in the caudate putamen with stimulation pulse trains of 120,
60, 24, and 12 pulses at 60 Hz. (B) Associated concentration vs time
plot. (C) Averaged dopamine concentration at different pulses detected
at CNT-Nb microelectrodes (n = 4). The electrode
was scanned from −0.4 to 1.3 V and back at 400 V/s at 10 Hz.

Conclusions
In
summary, we successfully grew CNTs on Nb and used CNTs on cylindrical
wires as microelectrodes for the first time. Small wire microelectrodes
should minimize tissue damage and improve spatial resolution, which
are needed for in vivo applications. This work is the first to compare
CNT growth on various metal wires as well as carbon fibers, and the
comparison is useful in choosing appropriate substrates for future
CNT studies. CNTs forest-grown on Nb wires are shorter, denser, and
more aligned than CNTs grown on other substrates, which led to enhanced
current density and better LOD for dopamine. In addition, CNT-Nb microelectrodes
are stable over 4 h of continuous measurement and are able to measure
stimulated dopamine release in anesthetized rats. CNT-Nb microelectrodes
have potential applications for the detection of neurotransmitters
in vivo or metal electrode arrays in electrophysiology studies.
