Recent development of two-photon
phosphorescence lifetime microscopy
(2PLM) of oxygen enabled first noninvasive high-resolution measurements
of tissue oxygenation in vivo in 3D, providing valuable physiological
information. The so far developed two-photon-enhanced phosphorescent
probes comprise antenna-core constructs, in which two-photon absorbing
chromophores (antenna) capture and channel excitation energy to a
phosphorescent core (metalloporphyrin) via intramolecular excitation
energy transfer (EET). These probes allowed demonstration of the methods’
potential; however, they suffer from a number of limitations, such
as partial loss of emissivity to competing triplet state deactivation
pathways (e.g., electron transfer) and suboptimal sensitivity to oxygen,
thereby limiting spatial and temporal resolution of the method. Here
we present a new probe, PtTCHP-C307, designed to overcome these limitations.
The key improvements include significant increase in the phosphorescence
quantum yield, higher efficiency of the antenna-core energy transfer,
minimized quenching of the phosphorescence by electron transfer and
increased signal dynamic range. For the same excitation flux, the
new probe is able to produce up to 6-fold higher signal output than
previously reported molecules. Performance of PtTCHP-C307 was demonstrated
in vivo in pO2 measurements through the intact mouse skull
into the bone marrow, where all blood cells are made from hematopoietic
stem cells.

==== Body
The ability to quantify molecular
oxygen (O2) in vivo in real time with high spatial and
temporal resolution has long been a much desired objective in biomedical
research.1 Oxygen is transported throughout
the body by blood, bound to hemoglobin inside red blood cells. After
dissociation from the carrier, it reaches its consumption sites, mitochondria,
by diffusion, crossing through vessel walls and cellular membranes.
While the hemoglobin-bound oxygen can be quantified in vivo using,
for example, differences between the absorption spectra of oxy- and
deoxyhemoglobin,2 detection of free unbound
oxygen is a much more challenging problem. Yet it is the unbound oxygen
that is utilized in cellular respiration; and in disease, the balance
between the bound and unbound oxygen can be compromised due to impaired
delivery and/or consumption. It follows that direct measurements of
free oxygen are necessary to quantify tissue metabolism and evaluate
physiology of diseased states.3

The
phosphorescence quenching method4 has been
developed specifically with the above goal in mind and
used in numerous in vivo applications: from fiber optic measurements5−7 to wide field imaging,8−11 microscopy,12−14 and tomography.15,16 The method relies on the ability of oxygen to quench emissive triplet
states of exogenous probes dissolved in biological fluids.17 Measurements by phosphorescence can be made
absolute if probes are able to retain their calibration parameters
when placed in biological environment in vivo.18−20 Such probes
can be delivered into blood plasma or extravasuclar space, where they
report quantitatively on oxygen concentration.17 Due to the presence of large hydrophilic coats, quantitative
oxygen probes cannot permeate cellular membranes. On the other hand,
a number of recently reported membrane-permeable phosphorescent constructs21−25 successfully accumulate inside cells but can only reflect relative
changes in oxygenation, which is due to the intrinsic uncertainty
of their calibration in complex intracellular environments.

One recently developed mode of the phosphorescence quenching oximetry
is based on the combination of phosphorescence with two-photon excitation,
termed two-photon (2P) phosphorescence lifetime microscopy (2PLM).26,27 Increased depth of tissue penetration by infrared light along with
confinement of excitation to the vicinity of the laser focus are especially
attractive features of this approach, as they minimize production
of toxic byproducts of the triplet quenching reaction (e.g., singlet
oxygen) and allow high-resolution sampling of oxygenation at depth
in tissue. Utility of 2PLM has been recently demonstrated in several
tissue imaging applications,28−33 warranting further development and optimization of the method.

Typically, biological oxygen sensors are built around Pt or Pd
porphyrins, which possess high emissivity and suitable triplet lifetimes,18,34,35 but very low two-photon absorption
(2PA) cross sections.36 To circumvent this
problem, we have developed an approach based on antenna-core constructs,
in which phosphorescence emission is coupled to 2PA via intramolecular
excitation energy transfer (EET).36,37 The antenna-core
probes are encapsulated into dendrimers, which control the rate of
oxygen diffusion to phosphorescent chromophores and regulate efficiency
of quenching. External coating of the dendrimers with poly(ethylene
glycol) layers prevents probe aggregation and interactions with endogenous
biomolecules. Optimization of such probes requires fine-tuning of
several interrelated parameters in order to obtain maximal photon
output and desirable analyte sensitivity.37−39

It is
important to mention that boosting output of two-photon (2P)
phosphorescent probes is especially important in view of their long
emission lifetimes (microseconds). In scanning microscopy applications,
imaging speed is proportional to the number of photons acquired by
the detector per unit time. The latter in turn is proportional to
the product of the emission rate and emission quantum yield. Since
the triplet (phosphorescence) lifetime is rather long (and the emission
rate is low), high phosphorescence quantum yield becomes especially
important for fast detection.

The first practical two-photon
oxygen probe, PtP-C343, was based
on a phosphorescent Pt tetraarylporphyrin (PtP) as a core and Coumarin-343
(C343) moieties, acting as 2PA antennae.27 Although PtP-C343 has been quite successful in demonstrating the
methods’ potential,28−33 it has several limitations, such as partial loss of emissivity to
competing quenching pathways (e.g., triplet electron transfer) and
suboptimal signal dynamic range. Similar and/or other problems have
been encountered in several later reported probes,20,40,41 of which one was successfully tested in
vivo.20 In this paper, we describe our
efforts to overcome the above limitations, focusing on increasing
phosphorescence quantum yield, improving efficiency of the antenna-core
energy transfer, minimizing quenching of phosphorescence by undesirable
intramolecular pathways, and optimizing the signal dynamic range.
We disclose a new probe, PtTCHP-C307, whose performance was validated
in vivo by performing the pO2 measurement through the intact
mouse skull into the bone marrow, where all blood cells are formed
from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that are thought to reside in
a hypoxic microenvironment.42−44

Experimental Methods
For description of standard procedures, animal protocols and compounds’
synthesis see the Supporting Information. To determine relative two-photon phosphorescence brightness spectra
(for a definition of “two-photon brightness”, see Results and Discussion), a setup was constructed
for time-resolved phosphorescence measurements under two-photon excitation.
The output of a tunable femtosecond laser oscillator (80 MHz repetition
rate, Chameleon Ultra II, Coherent) was passed through a half-wave
plate and a polarizer for power adjustment and then through an electro-optical
modulator (Atseva) to obtain 1 μs-long excitation gates (80
pluses per gate) at 1 kHz frequency. The contrast ratio of the modulator
was 1000:1, and the on/off time was <1 ns. The gated beam was focused
by a lens (f = 4 cm) at the center of a quartz cuvette
(Starna Cells) containing solution of a sample. After the cuvette,
the beam was directed at an optical power meter (FieldMaxII-TOP, Coherent),
placed immediately after the cuvette compartment.

The sample
solution was purged with Ar until phosphorescence lifetime
became constant and kept under slight Ar pressure to ensure that no
back-diffusion of oxygen occurred during the measurement. The phosphorescence
was collected by a convex lens (2.5 cm diameter) placed immediately
by the cell compartment at 90° relative to the direction of the
excitation beam. The collimated emission was passed through two short-pass
filters (RazorEdge SP 694 nm and SP 770 nm, Semrock) to remove scattered
laser light and focused by another lens onto the aperture of a photomultiplier
module (H7422P-50, Hamamatsu). The output of the PMT was measured
across a resistor (2 kΩ) using a data acquisition board (USB-6361,
National Instruments) and digitized at 1 MHz frequency. The board
was controlled by an in-house program written in C/C++ (Qt, Nokia).
Excitation gates (5000–10000) were averaged to obtain a decay,
whose integrated intensity was normalized by (i) the overlap integral
of the emission spectrum of the sample, quantum efficiency spectrum
of the detector and the transmission spectra of the filters; (ii)
concentration of the sample; (iii) the square of the refractive index
of the solvent;45 and (iv) the square of
the excitation flux. The latter was calculated assuming that the cross
section of the beam was wavelength-independent. The femtoseconds pulse
duration, measured by an aurocorrelator, varied in the range of 120–175
fs through the tunability range of the laser: 700–1050 nm.
The average laser power was kept approximately constant throughout
the excitation spectrum, typically 100 mW (1.25 nJ per pulse), as
measured with the modulator turned off. At the 0.001 duty cycle (gate
duration, 1 μs; modulator rep rate, 1 kHz), the average power
on the sample with the modulator on was 0.1 mW. The normalized integrated
decay intensity was plotted against the excitation wavelength (i.e.,
central wavelength of the envelope) to give the two-photon phosphorescence
brightness spectrum.

In vivo imaging experiments were performed
using a custom-built
microscope with a video-rate laser-scanning 2P intravital imaging
arm and a point-detection 2P phosphorescence lifetime measurement
arm.33 The excitation source was a pulsed
femtosecond laser (MaiTai, SpectraPhysics, 80 MHz repetition rate).
It was tuned to 820 nm and used to visualize the bone by second harmonic
generation (SHG) and the bone marrow vasculature by 2P-excited fluorescence
of a macromolecular vascular dye (Rhodamine dextran, MW 70 kDa). For
excitation of PtTCHP-C307, the laser was tuned to 765 nm, and the
beam, focused by a lens (f = 5 cm), was scanned by
a galvanometer mirror (6220H, Cambridge Technology) across a 100 μm-wide
slit (NT38–560, Edmund Optics), positioned in the focal plane
of the lens, to generate a microseconds-long excitation pulse. After
passing through the slit, the beam was focused by a water immersion,
infinity corrected, near-infrared-coated objective lens (UPLSAPO 60XW,
Olympus America Inc.; 60 × 1.2 NA; working distance, 280 μm).
The generated phosphorescence was collected by the same objective
lens and directed to a photomultiplier tube after passing through
several optical filters. The arrival time of individual photons after
the pulse excitation was recorded using a custom photon counting circuit.
The histogram of the photon arrival times was then analyzed to obtain
the phosphorescence lifetime.

Results and Discussion
The state
diagram underlying the principles of 2P-enhanced antenna-core
phosphorescent probes is shown in Figure 1a.
Two-photon excitation first populates a 2P-accessible state of the
antenna (AS2P), which may or may not be the
same as its first excited singlet state (AS1). State AS2P, if different from AS1, rapidly internally converts to AS1. The antenna chromophore(s) is positioned sufficiently close to
the phosphorescent core, so that the excitation energy transfer (EET),
presumably via the Förster dipole–dipole mechanism,
efficiently populates the excited singlet state of the core (CS1). The following intersystem crossing within
the core (CS1→CT1) produces the triplet state (CT1), which either
emits phosphorescence or undergoes quenching by molecular oxygen.
For imaging applications, it is essential that minimal losses are
encountered in the energy cascade leading to the final emissive state
(CT1). It is also important that the quantum
yield of phosphorescence from the CT1 state
is not diminished due to competing deactivation processes [e.g., triplet
electron transfer (ET) and subsequent charge recombination (CR),38,46 shown in Figure 1a with dashed lines].

of all involved states. (b) Chromophores used in construction of probe
PtTCHP-C307: coumarin-307 (C307) and PtTCHP (2, 3).

The above scheme imposes
several requirements on the components
of the probe. First, the core chromophore (C) must possess bright
oxygen-sensitive phosphorescence. Second, antenna (A) must have a
sufficiently high two-photon absorption (2PA) cross section, strong
radiative singlet decay, and emission spectrum overlapping with absorption
of the core for maximally efficient ETT. Third, the redox potentials
of the core and the antenna must be tuned to eliminate the possibility
of intramolecular ET between the long-lived triplet state of the core
(CT1) and the ground state of the antenna (AS0) with formation of a dark charge separated state
(CS). The last but not least, components of the probe must enable
efficient synthetic assembly. Selection of the probe components was
based on our previous spectroscopic and electrochemical studies.37−39,47

Choice of Chromophores
The majority of phosphorescent
probes are based on Pt or Pd complexes of meso-tetraarylporphyrins.17,48 These tetrapyrroles can be readily synthesized with a variety of
functional groups; however, inclusion of meso-aryl
substituents into the porphyrin macrocycle is known to diminish triplet
emissivity.49−52 On the other hand, Pt tetracyclohexenoporphyrin (PtTCHP, 2; Figure 1b), which also has eight functionalizable
carboxylic groups, is free of that problem. The phosphorescence quantum
yield of 2 in deoxygenated organic solvents (e.g., in
dimethylacetamide, DMA) reaches as high as 0.43 (compared to 0.07
for Pt tetraphenylporphyrin), and its triplet lifetime of ∼100
μs (in deoxygenated solutions at 22 °C) ensures excellent
oxygen sensitivity (Table 1).

2 was synthesized by insertion of Pt into the corresponding free-base
porphyrin (Scheme S1 of the Supporting Information), which appeared as an intermediate in an earlier published synthesis
of meso-unsubstituted tetrabenzoporphyrins.47 Hydrolysis of the peripheral ester groups yielded octaacid 3, suitable for subsequent functionalization.

In our
earlier studies, we have found that “good”
2P dyes usually are also very potent quenchers of porphyrin triplet
states38,39 by way of ET/CR processes (Figure 1a). Among tested chromophores, Coumarin-343 (C343)
was found to be the least efficient quencher, and it was paired with
Pt meso-tetra-4-alkoxyphenylporphyrin (PtP) for construction
of PtP-C343.27 However, diffusion-based
quenching experiments (see ref (39) for experimental details) revealed that C343 strongly quenches
phosphorescence of 2, indicating that the reduction potential
of PtTCHP is lower than that of PtP.55 Therefore,
we turned our attention to antenna dyes more prone to oxidation.

Coumarin 307 (C307; Figure 1b) is
a commercially
available bright fluorescent dye, whose photophysical properties (Figure 2, panels a and b, Table 1) have been thoroughly studied.57−60 2PA of C307 (Figure 2c) is somewhat weaker than that of C343 (see the Supporting Information for 2PA spectrum), but
its fluorescence overlaps well with absorption of 2 (Figure 2d), ensuring efficient EET. Due to the presence
of electron-withdrawing CF3 group, the oxidation potential
of C307 is relatively high [i.e., 1.41 V (measured vs NHE)].59 Indeed, phosphorescence of porphyrin 2 was found to be completely insensitive to C307, even when the latter
was present in millimolar quantities. In contrast, C343 caused noticeable
quenching of the phosphorescence of 2 already at micromolar
levels.

It has been reported in the literature that fluorescence
of 7-aminocoumarins
depends strongly on the degree of substitution in the amino group.58 For example, alkylation of C307 with tBu-bromoacetate (Scheme S2 of the Supporting
Information) gave derivative 4, whose fluorescence
quantum yield was drastically reduced compared to that of parent coumarin
C307 (ϕfl = 0.01 vs 0.91, Table 1). To preserve bright fluorescence and at the same time enable
functionalization, an analogue of C307 was synthesized (coumarin 8) with monoalkylated amino group (Scheme 1), having a substituent terminated by protected carboxylic
acid residue. Coumarin 6 was obtained by Pechmann condensation,61,62 followed by monoalkylation with tBu-bromoacetate,
cleavage of tBu ester, and amidation with mono-Boc-protected
ethylenediamine. Important for our application, the deprotected (acid)
form of 8 retained its high fluorescence quantum yield
in water (ϕfl = 0.8).

Excitation Energy Transfer
(EET)
The efficiency of
the EET between C307 and PtTCHP was evaluated based on the Förster
theory, using the spectroscopic data for coumarin 8 and
porphyrin 2 in DMF (Figure 3a)
and assuming random orientation of the transition dipole moment vectors
(orientation factor κ2 = 2/3). It is important to
note that the acceptor in our case is a highly symmetrical metalloporphyrin
that has not one but two orthogonally polarized degenerate transitions,
Qx and Qy,
near 540 nm. Consequently, the value of κ2 is expected
to be higher than 2/3, as both Qx and
Qy can interact with the donor (C307).
At the same time, the oscillator strength for each of the transitions
should be one-half of that measured for the Q-band of PtTCHP. The
overall effect of this arrangement should be a larger apparent EET
efficiency than for a single acceptor transition dipole moment. Nevertheless,
even in this simplified estimate, the Förster radius R0 was found to be quite large at R0 = 44.9 Å, suggesting that the EET between coumarin
and porphyrin in a covalent assembly, where distances between the
chromophores do not exceed 1–2 nm, should be very efficient.

For experimental evaluation of EET, we first
constructed model
compound 10 (Figure 3), in which
eight coumarin moieties are attached directly to the peripheral carboxyl
groups on the porphyrin via short ethylenediamine linkers (Scheme
S1 of the Supporting Information). This
molecule was much easier to synthesize than the final dendritic oxygen
probe (see below), while it permitted testing of the key photophysical
processes underlying the probes’ function.

Nearly complete
lack of the coumarin fluorescence upon excitation
of 10 at λex = 440 nm revealed that
the excitation energy in this model molecule is fully directed from
the donor chromophore into nonradiative channels. Almost a complete
match between the absorption and excitation spectra (λem = 647 nm, Figure 3) indicated that fluorescence
quenching was indeed due to a very efficient EET (>99%). For this
analysis, the excitation and the absorption spectra were normalized
by the maxima of the lowest-allowed transition [i.e., CS0→CS1-Q-band of PtTCHP (λmax = 535 nm)]. It is known that in Pt porphyrins S1→T1 intersystem crossing occurs with nearly unity
efficiency.63,64 Therefore, all the energy that
reached the CS1 level could be considered utilized
in the formation of the emissive CT1 state (Figure 1). Importantly, concentrations of the samples for
recording of the excitation spectra were kept very low, such that
the absorption maxima in the Soret band region (λmax = 380 nm) were below 0.05 o.d. (The molar extinction of the porphyrin
near 400 nm is very high, ε > 3 × 105 M–1 cm–1). This precaution was necessary
in order to avoid inner filter effects that otherwise may have significantly
distorted the excitation spectra.

The phosphorescence quantum
yield of 10 was found
to be almost identical to that of porphyrin 2, establishing
that the triplet ET in 10 is not an effective quenching
pathway despite the presence of eight coumarin moieties directly linked
to the porphyrin core. Taken together, these measurements confirmed
that PtTCHP and C307 indeed are suitable as components for construction
of a practical two-photon phosphorescent oxygen probe.

Two-Photon-Enhanced
Phosphorescent Probe PtTCHP-C307
The structure and the synthesis
of probe PtTCHP-C307 (15) are shown in Scheme 1. In the first step,
the carboxyl groups on porphyrin 3 were amended by 4-aminobutyrate
linkers to facilitate coupling of bulky dendrons. This strategy proved
very efficient previously in the synthesis of other dendritic probes,19 serving to decrease the steric interference
between the adjacent coupling sites on the porphyrin.

Pt porphyrin 11 was dendrimerized with eight Gen 2 glutamic dendrons. The
role of the dendrimer has been discussed extensively in our previous
publications.17,18,36 In brief, dendritic encapsulation prevents aggregation of porphyrins,
enhances their solubility, and enables control over the rate of oxygen
diffusion to the excited state triplet chromophore. In addition, positioning
of 2P antenna at the periphery of the dendrimer keeps antenna chromophores
at a distance from the core, further decreasing probability of the
phosphorescence quenching by triplet ET.27,37 The choice of polyglutamic dendrimers in the present case was motivated
by their relatively moderate shielding efficiency.65 One of our goals was to achieve optimal dynamic range of
phosphorescence lifetimes throughout the range of physiological oxygen
concentrations (0–160 mmHg). While no shielding of the porphyrin
would result in a nearly complete quenching and consequently very
low photon output already at ambient oxygen concentrations, too much
shielding would narrow the dynamic range of lifetimes and thus decrease
oxygen sensitivity. On the basis of our previous studies27,65,66 and considering ∼80–100
μs triplet lifetime of PtTCHP’s (at zero-oxygen), moderate
shielding by glutamic dendrimers seemed more appropriate than by aryl-glycine
(AG) dendrons used in the synthesis of PtP-C343.27

Gen 2 glutamic dendrons65 were linked
to the porphyrin core using standard HBTU/DIPEA coupling method, followed
by hydrolysis of the peripheral ester groups. The resulting Pt porphyrin-dendrimer
acid (14) exhibits very high aqueous solubility, resembling
in this regard other polyglutamic porphyrin-dendrimers, but having
much brighter phosphorescence. C307 antenna fragments were linked
divergently to the termini of 14, and the remaining carboxyl
groups were modified with monomethoxypolyetheleneglycol amines (mPEG-NH2, av MW 1000) in a single-pot reaction, using the same HBTU/DIPEA
coupling method. After purification of 15 by size-exclusion
chromatography (Biorad SX-1, THF), UV–vis absorption spectra
revealed that each probe molecule on average contains 4–5 residues
of C307. MALDI analysis of the final material showed distribution
of masses with the center mass corresponding to the dendrimer bearing
27 out of ∼33 possible PEG residues. Similar PEGylation efficiency
has been seen previously in other dendritic probes.19

The photophysical constants of the new probe PtTCHP-C307
(15) and its precursor 14 are summarized
in Table 2 and Figure 4.

The absorption
spectrum of 15 (Figure 4a) closely
resembles superposition of a weighted spectrum
of C307 and PtTCHP, indicating no significant ground or excited state
electronic interactions between the chromophores. Similar to 10, excitation of the antenna in 15 at 430 nm
(off the Soret peak of PtTCHP) in deoxygenated solution produced strong
porphyrin phosphorescence (Figure 4b) but only
a small residual coumarin fluorescence (ϕfl <
0.01), suggesting that the efficiency of EET in 15 is
quite high. Indeed, comparison of the absorption and excitation spectra
of 15 in the same manner as the described for 10 revealed that EET in the probe molecule occurs with ∼97%
efficiency.

(τ–1 vs pO2, where τ is the

The phosphorescence quantum yields
of both 15 and 14 were found to be practically
the same but somewhat lower
than the quantum yield of the core PtTCHP (i.e., 0.25 vs 0.43 in deoxygenated
DMF). In water, additional reduction in the emission yield was observed
similar to other phosphorescent porphyrins.18,19 Nevertheless, both 15 and 14 remain by
far the brightest emitters among known oxygen probes.

To evaluate
performance of probe 15 under 2P excitation,
we compared its phosphorescence output to that of the “nonenhanced”
dendritic porphyrin 14 as well as to the previously published
probe PtP-C343.27 Integrated phosphorescence
intensity under 2P excitation plotted against excitation wavelength
gave the 2P phosphorescence brightness spectra (Figure 4c), directly suitable for comparison between different probes
(see Experimental for details). Importantly,
the signal was confirmed to exhibit quadratic power dependence (i.e.,
slope of the log–log plot = 2.00 ± 0.05) at each excitation
wavelength. 2P brightness here is defined as a parameter proportional
to the product of the 2P excitation cross section and emission quantum
yield.67 Note that the latter may not be
constant throughout the excitation range. For example, for 2P-enhanced
probes, such as 15, the emission quantum yield is the
product of the quantum yields of all processes connecting the initially
populated AS2P state to the final emissive state CT1 (Figure 1). In the region
where 2PA is dominated by the antenna, this includes the quantum yield
of the EET.

As expected, “nonenhanced” porphyrin 14 shows negligible 2PA in the Soret band region (S0→S2), where its linear absorption is extremely
strong (linear
spectrum of 14 is shown in Figure 4c by a dashed line). In accordance with the parity selection rules,
for centrosymmetrical chromophores (such as PtTCHP), electrical-dipole-allowed
transitions (g→u) are not
accessible for two-photon excitation,68,69 which instead
may occur into states of g symmetry (g→g). Noteworthy is a small peak at 995 nm,
which coincides with the vibronic Q01 band in the linear
absorption spectrum and, therefore, may be due to an unsymmetrical
vibration.

The enhancement of the excitation efficiency in the
range of 730–900
nm for 15, which corresponds to the 2P absorption of
C307 antenna, is apparent from Figure 4c. For
example, at 750 nm, the increase in the signal due to the absorption
of C307 and EET is ∼14-fold compared to “nonenhanced”
porphyrin 14. Notably, moving excitation to shorter wavelengths
results in lowering of the power dependence order due to the increasing
contribution of linear S0→T1 absorption.
In Pt porphyrins, spin-forbidden S0→T1 transitions may gain significant dipole strength due to a very strong
spin–orbit coupling,38,52 the effect also responsible
for their high triplet emissivity.

Compared to the previously
designed probe PtP-C343, 15 shows substantial increase
in the signal intensity in the near-Soret
band region. In all so-far published neuroimaging studies,28−30,32 PtP-C343 was excited at 840 nm
(i.e., away from its 2PA maximum (near 920 nm). Nevertheless, even
such off-peak excitation was adequate to sample oxygenation of regions
as deep as 400–500 μm under the tissue surface. To that
end, when excited at 840 nm probe 15 produces ∼3
times stronger phosphorescence than PtP-C343, and at 760 nm its output
is more than 6 times higher than that of PtP-C343. It is worth noting
that the gain in the signal comes mainly from the increase in the
phosphorescence quantum yield, which is the key parameter in 2PLM
and other scanning microscopy applications. Higher 2PA cross section
helps produce the emissive excited state using less laser power, but
under saturation conditions, signal output is determined solely by
the emission yield.27,70,71

Oxygen sensitivity of 15 was measured in a standard
phosphate-buffered solution as well as in a solution containing bovine
serum albumin (BSA, 2%) and directly in the mouse blood plasma. Albumin
is present in the blood plasma in ∼2% concentration and is
extremely effective in binding various organic molecules, including
porphyrins and other dyes. Binding to BSA dramatically changes oxygen
quenching properties of phosphorescent probes,4,65 while
lack of such changes can be considered a good indicator that the probe
is not interacting with biological solutes; in vivo its calibration
will be retained. PEGylation of dendrimers suppresses interactions
with albumin and other biological macromolecules.18 It can be seen in Figure 4d that
the Stern–Volmer oxygen quenching plot of 15 is
completely insensitive to the presence of BSA. Furthermore, oxygen
quenching parameters of the probe are unchanged in intact blood plasma,
and such insensitivity to the environment is sustained at body temperatures
(see the Supporting Information for probe
calibration plots at 36.5 °C). Collectively, these data suggest
that the probe can be used for quantitative oxygen measurements in
vivo. The Stern–Volmer oxygen quenching constant of 15 was found to be ∼1200 mmHg–1 s–1 at 36.5 °C, which is ∼10 times higher than that of PtP-C343
under similar conditions. Therefore, 15 has much larger
dynamic range (r) of lifetimes (r = τ0/τair, where τ0 and τair are the phosphorescence lifetimes at zero-oxygen
and at air equilibrium, respectively) than PtP-C343 (rPtTCHP-C307 ≈ 18 vs RPtP-C343 ≈ 3) and higher oxygen sensitivity. In fact, the lifetime
and the quantum yield of 15 are optimal for measurements
in the pO2 range of 0–60 mmHg, but at higher pO2’s its phosphorescence becomes rather strongly quenched.
Luckily, in the majority of biological settings tissue pO2 does not exceed 50 mmHg.

Application of Probe PtTCHP-C307 in Vivo
As a test-bed
application, the new probe 15 was used to measure intravascular
pO2 in bone marrow of a live mouse.

Figure 5 (a) Two-photon intravital
image of bone marrow vasculature (red,
Rhodamine-Dextran, 70 kDa) and bone (blue, Second Harmonic Generation)
in the calvarium of a Nestin-GFP mouse (λex = 820
nm). Phosphorescence lifetime measurement using PtTCHP-C307 was performed
at the location shown in green (green dot, λex =
765 nm). (b) Corresponding trace of the phosphorescence decay in location
marked in (a). The measurement followed the protocol developed earlier.33 The laser beam was focused ∼80 μm
under the bone surface. By scanning the beam across a slit (see Experimental Methods for details), a line trace
∼3.5 μM long was produced with total duration of ∼20
μs. Using such line-excitation allowed us to avoid triplet saturation
effects, which may occur in stationary point-excitation.71 Two thousand scans were averaged to produce
the trace of phosphorescence. The trace was fit with a single exponential
function, and the pO2 value was generated by using an in
vitro obtained calibration curve (37 °C and pH 7.2). Scale bar
∼100 μm.

Physiological environment of the bone marrow is believed
to play
a critical role in the formation of all blood cells (leukocytes and
erythrocytes) from stem and progenitor cells, the process called hematopoiesis.
The hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are considered to reside in a
relatively hypoxic environment despite the fact that the bone marrow
is a highly vascularized tissue,33 with
sinusoidal blood vessels occupying 25–30% of the tissue volume
and spaced ∼46 μm apart.72 However, until recently,33 no direct
measurements of pO2 in the HSC niche have been possible,
leaving the question about the role of hypoxia for the HSC development
unanswered. Here using two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy
and PtP-C307, we were able to show that the sinusoidal blood vessels
are indeed poorly oxygenated (Figure 5), supporting
the possibility that the HSC may reside in a vascular niche73 and yet be in a deeply hypoxic microenvironment.
This result is fully in line with our recent more comprehensive measurements
using probe PtP-C343,33 confirming that
PtTCHP-C307 is well-suited for high-resolution in vivo oxygen microscopy.
Furthermore, higher performance of PtTCHP-C307 enables faster data
acquisition and allows for lower excitation energy, important advantages
for in vivo imaging.
