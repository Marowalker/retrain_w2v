The
cellular phospholipid membrane plays an important role in cell
function and cell–cell communication, but its biocomplexity
and dynamic nature presents a challenge for examining cellular uptake
of phospholipids and the resultant effects on cell function. Platelets,
small anuclear circulating cell bodies that influence a wide variety
of physiological functions through their dynamic secretory and adhesion
behavior, present an ideal platform for exploring the effects of exogenous
phospholipids on membrane phospholipid content and cell function.
In this work, a broad range of platelet functions are quantitatively
assessed by leveraging a variety of analytical chemistry techniques,
including ultraperformance liquid chromatography–tandem electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS), vasculature-mimicking
microfluidic analysis, and single cell carbon-fiber microelectrode
amperometry (CFMA). The relative enrichments of phosphatidylserine
(PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were characterized with UPLC–MS/MS,
and the effects of the enrichment of these two phospholipids on both
platelet secretory behavior and adhesion were examined. Results show
that, in fact, both PS and PE influence platelet adhesion and secretion.
PS was enriched dramatically and decreased platelet adhesion as well
as secretion from δ-, α-, and lysosomal granules. PE enrichment
was moderate and increased secretion from platelet lysosomes. These
insights illuminate the critical connection between membrane phospholipid
character and platelet behavior, and both the methods and results
presented herein are likely translatable to other mammalian cell systems.

==== Body
The perception
of the cellular
phospholipid membrane as an inactive barrier between the cytosol and
the extracellular space has been challenged by many recent studies.
In particular, membrane-bound phospholipids have been shown to have
active roles in cellular signaling and receptor expression.1,2 The membranes of mammalian cells contain phospholipids of numerous
classes including phosphatidylserines (PS), phosphatidylethanolamines
(PE), phosphatidylcholines (PC), and sphingomyelines (SM), as well
as cholesterol and many membrane-bound peptides and proteins.3,4 Selectively examining the roles of individual membrane components
is challenging because exposure to exogenous phospholipids can induce
up- or down-regulation of any of the membrane components. Many studies
employ model lipid bilayers, which eliminate nearly all of the biocomplexity
of the cellular membrane,3 and it is unclear
if studies on such model lipid bilayers translate to physiologically
relevant systems. In this study, primary blood platelets are used
as a platform to examine whether cellular membranes can incorporate
exogenous phospholipids and if so, what effects enrichment of membrane
phospholipids have on cellular function. The anuclear nature of platelets
makes them an ideal platform for studies of membrane phospholipids
as they have minimal capacity to up- or down-regulate protein expression
in response to exposure to exogenous phospholipids.5 Additionally, platelets uniquely feature multiple types
of secretory granules, each with a different type of stored cargo,6 which enables the study of phospholipid effects
on different classes of granules and chemical messenger cargo.

The asymmetric distribution of phospholipids within cellular membranes
has important consequences in cell–cell communication.1 Aminophospholipids, including phosphatidylserine
(PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), are the abundant phospholipids
in the plasma membrane, and they are localized to the inner leaflet
of the plasma membrane.7−9 Upon platelet activation, both PS and PE are exposed
to the outer membrane surface. It has been shown that both the asymmetric
distribution at rest and scrambling of the phospholipids upon activation
are critical for cellular adhesion and the chemical messenger secretion
process; in fact, disruption of the phospholipid asymmetry and redistribution
is known to impair these functions.10−14 Fusion between the granular membrane and the plasma
membrane is a critical step of exocytosis (the secretion of preformed
granule-stored chemical messenger species), and the characteristics
and actions of membrane lipid species are of innate importance in
these events.10,15,16 In fact, it has been shown that incubation with exogenous phospholipids
can mediate both the mechanism and the kinetics of exocytotic events
in model exocytotic systems such as PC12 and chromaffin cells.11−13,17 Because of their anuclear nature,
platelet membranes are more stable and undergo minimal constitutive
exocytosis, making it easier to draw conclusions about the direct
effect of phospholipid substitution. Phospholipid content not only
influences the fluidity and the curvature of the membrane but also
promotes shape change and spreading of the platelets. When exposed
to the outer leaflet of the platelet membrane, PS and PE serve as
binding sites for circulating protein coagulation factors and also
have catalytic activity in the formation of clots.

In addition
to being an ideal model for studying the conserved
process of exocytosis, platelets are also important players in various
physiological processes, including hemostasis, inflammation, and angiogenesis,
and phospholipids play a key role in these processes.6,18 As with other cells, an important regulatory component of the dynamic
secretory and adhesion behavior of platelets is the phospholipid membrane,
which plays an important role in influencing how platelets interact
with their environment.3 While clearly
important, the exact role of membrane phospholipids in platelet activation
and adhesion is not well characterized, mainly due to analytical limitations
in characterizing cellular uptake of phospholipids. Herein, this work
provides an improved fundamental understanding of how changes in the
phospholipid membrane affect platelet behavior through the measurement
of numerous platelet functions on both the single-cell and ensemble
levels. The methods and results presented herein give general understanding
about the role of the phospholipid bilayer in cell function and can
be easily adapted for use with other cell types. Additionally, the
physiological relevance of studies on platelets, specifically, will
lead to enhanced therapeutic approaches related to thrombosis, inflammation,
and angiogenesis, among others.

Because of their small size
and short lifespan (generally 1 day
in vitro or 1–5 days for clinical use), platelet secretory
functions are typically studied using indirect methods. In fact, platelet
secretion occurs from three distinct populations of storage granules
(each releasing unique messenger molecules) as well as on-demand manufacture
of bioactive lipid species. To address the challenges associated with
quantitative assessments of such a broad range of functions associated
with a small and short-lived cell type, this work employs a variety
of techniques to characterize the enrichments of PS and PE and the
effects of PE or PS enrichment on both platelet secretory and adhesion
behavior. In addition to measuring ensemble secretion of chemical
messenger species from many platelets in suspension (platelet factor
4 (PF4) from α-granules, serotonin from δ-granules,
and β-hexosaminidase from lysosomes), which reveals information
about the behavior of many platelets while they are in communication
with one another, single cell carbon-fiber microelectrode amperometry
(CFMA) measurements enable evaluation of the phospholipid content
effects on quantal release and kinetics of individual δ-granule
secretion. In parallel, the PS- or PE-enriched platelet adhesion behavior
was assessed within a microfluidic platform where the feature size
and endothelial cell coating mimic intravenous vasculature. Results
show that, in fact, both PS and PE influence platelet adhesion and
secretion. PS enrichment decreased platelet adhesion and decreased
the secretion of δ-, α-, and lysosomal granules while
PE enrichment increased secretion from platelet lysosomes. CFMA measurements
showed that PS regulates granule recruitment and influences the frequency
of secretion events while PS enrichment improves the stability of
granule-cell membrane fusion events. Overall, this work reveals the
importance of phospholipids in regulation of platelet behavior and
highlights the utility of platelets as a platform for exploring the
involvement of membrane phospholipids in the functions of mammalian
cells.

Materials and Methods
Safety Considerations
All manufacturer-recommended
safety precautions were followed. Gloves, goggles, and labcoats should
be worn when handling acetic acid, acetonitrile, methanol, acetone,
or chloroform. Chloroform should be evaporated only in a hood. Animals
should be handled in accordance with IACUC-approved protocols.

Platelet
Isolation and Phospholipid Incubation
All
reagents used were analytical grade or higher quality. KCl, MgCl2, N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-2ethanesulfonic acid, and thrombin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
NaCl was purchased from BDH Chemicals. α-d-(+)-Glucose
was purchased from Acros Organics. LC/MS-grade H2O and
acetonitrile (ACN) were purchased from J.T. Baker. LC/MS-grade isopropyl
alcohol (IPA), Na2CO3, and citric acid were
purchased from Fisher Scientific. Sodium bicarbonate and sodium citrate
were purchased from Mallinckrodt. Deuterated platelet activating factor
(PAF-d4) was purchased from Cayman Chemical,
and all phospholipids were purchased in chloroform from Avanti Polar
Lipids, species no. 840032 for PS (porcine brain), no. 841118 for
PE (chicken egg), no. 860061 for SM (chicken egg), and no. 840054
for PC (soy). Nine-week old C57BL/6J mice were purchased from The
Jackson Laboratory.

Blood was drawn via cardiac puncture from
10 week old mice euthanized via CO2 asphyxiation (following
IACUC-approved protocol no. 0806A37663) using 1 mL syringes prefilled
with 200 μL of acid citrate dextrose (ACD), and washed platelets
was isolated using the procedure described previously.19

The 200 μM PS, PC, PE, and SM solutions
were prepared by
drying appropriate volumes of phospholipids as received in chloroform
in glass vials under a stream of nitrogen and sonicating in Tyrode’s
buffer for 2 h, until all cloudiness had disappeared from the solutions.
Phospholipid solutions were then filtered using 0.2 μm filters.
Platelets were incubated with phospholipid or negative control solutions
for 2 h at 37 °C.

Relative Quantification of Phospholipid Enrichment
Relative enrichments of PS, PC, PE, and SM in platelets were assessed
using ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass
spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS). It is known that the phospholipid
standards used were not composed of pure samples of one phospholipid
species, so absolute quantitation was not feasible. Rather, the primary
species in each phospholipid standard was used as a reference to assess
the enrichment of phospholipid-incubated platelets as compared to
control, nonincubated platelets. Following incubation with PS, PC,
PE, SM, or Tyrode’s buffer (control), platelets were washed
twice by centrifugation at 1000g and resuspended
in 6:1 Tyrode’s buffer/ACD. After the final wash, platelets
were resuspended in 100 μL of Tyrode’s buffer, and phospholipids
were extracted using a modified Bligh and Dyer extraction. Platelets
were mixed with 400 μL of CHCl3/200 μL methanol
(MeOH)/10 μL 19.1 μM PAF-d4 (internal standard) and sonicated for 20 min. A volume of 100 μL
of 0.1% acetic acid in 0.1 M NaCl was then added, and samples were
sonicated for an additional 10 min. Samples were centrifuged for 5
min at 1500 g, and the upper aqueous layer was removed and discarded.
The lower organic layer was dried under vacuum, and phospholipids
were resuspended in 200 μL of 0.1% acetic acid in 40/60 A/B
(A was 20 mM ammonium acetate in water, pH 5, and organic mobile phase
B was 0.1% acetic acid in 9:1 ACN/acetone) by 1 h sonication. Samples
were centrifuged at 1500 g for 5 min and transferred to fresh tubes
prior to UPLC–MS/MS analysis.

UPLC–MS/MS analysis
was performed using a Waters Acquity triple quadrupole mass spectrometer
using a modified version of the chromatography suggested by Rainville
and Plumb with a Waters Acquity BEH C8(1.7 μm) 2.1
mm × 100 mm column.20 Deuterated platelet-activating
factor (PAF-d4) was used as an internal
standard. Chromatography used a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min: 60% B, 0
to 1.0 min; 60% B to 80% B, 1.0 to 2.0 min; 80% B to 84% B, 2.0 to
2.5 min; 84% B, 2.5 to 2.75 min; 84% B to 86% B, 2.75 to 3.0 min;
86% B, 3.0 to 3.25 min; 86% B to 87.7% B, 3.25 to 3.5 min; 87.7% B,
3.5 to 3.75 min; 87.7% B to 95% B, 3.75 to 4 min; 95% B, 4.0 to 5.0
min; 95% B to 60% B, 5.0 to 5.5 min; 60% B, 5.5 to 7.0 min. Electrospray
ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) was operated in positive
ionization mode using the following parameters: capillary, 3.8 kV;
extractor, 3.00 V; rf lens, 0.30 V; source temperature, 120 °C;
desolvation temperature, 400 °C; cone gas flow, 20 L/h; desolvation
gas flow, 800 L/h; collision gas flow, 0.2 mL/min; low-mass resolution
(Q1), 12.00; high-mass resolution (Q1), 12.00; ion energy (Q1), 0.30;
and species-specific transitions are listed in Table 1.

Relative quantification of PS, PC, PE, and SM in each
of control
and phospholipid-incubated sample was accomplished using a calibration
curve of phospholipid standards subjected to the same extraction procedure
as the platelet samples; however, no platelets were present in the
calibration solutions. To account for variation in pelleting behavior
of platelets induced by phospholipid incubation, phospholipid quantification
results were normalized to average protein values of control- or phospholipid-incubated
nonactivated platelet pellets, as determined using a Pierce bicinchoninic
acid (BCA) assay.

Adhesion of Platelets Incubated with Phospholipids
A microfluidic device, employed to monitor platelet adhesion behavior
with varied phospholipid content, was fabricated as was previously
described.21An endothelial cell coating
of the microfluidic channel is achieved as previously described22 to simulate blood vessel architecture. Detailed
descriptions of device fabrication, endothelial cell culture, and
endothelial cell coating of the microfluidic device can be found in
the Supporting Information. Devices with
a uniform monolayer of endothelial cells were selected for experiments,
and the channel was washed with fresh Tyrode’s buffer before
exposure of endothelial cells to a stream of platelets. To facilitate
visual distinction of platelets from endothelial cells, platelets
were labeled with 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (CMFDA19, Invitrogen)
dye prior to phospholipid incubation. After phospholipid incubation,
platelets were activated with 5 μM ADP and introduced into the
microfluidic channel. Flow control was accomplished using a syringe
pump, and platelet suspensions were introduced onto the device through
Teflon tubing. The endothelial cell-coated channel was exposed to
a stream of platelets for 20 min at a constant flow rate of 30 μL/h.
This flow rate was chosen to avoid shear stress levels above 0.01
N/m2 (COMSOL simulation data not shown) to minimize shear
stress-induced platelet activation. After endothelial cell exposure
to a stream of platelets, the cell culture channel was washed with
fresh Tyrode’s buffer and fluorescence images were obtained
on an inverted microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY) equipped with a CCD
camera (QuantEM, Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) using Metamorph version
7.7.5 imaging software. Platelets adhered to endothelial cells were
counted, and for each experimental condition, the results from five
images (450 μm × 500 μm each) were averaged; in each
condition, five biological replicates were measured.

Ensemble Platelet
Secretion Measurements
Platelet δ-granule
secretion was measured after incubation of the washed platelets with
phospholipids using a modified version of a previously published HPLC
method making use of an electrochemical detector.23,24 For α-granule secretion, a PF4 Sandwich-ELISA assay
kit was purchased from R&D Systems and used as directed. Lysosomal
secretion was measured via a modified β-Hexosaminidase assay.25 Briefly, following incubation of platelets with
phospholipid solutions, platelets were exposed to Tyrode’s
buffer containing 10 U/mL thrombin (a physiological stimulant of platelet
activation) or Tyrode’s buffer (as control). Platelets were
centrifuged at 500 RCF to pellet. Supernatant portions were used for
the analysis of the secreted species (serotonin by HPLC, PF4 with the ELISA assay, and secreted hexosaminidase with the β-hexosaminidase
assay). Secreted platelet-activating factor (PAF) was measured using
a previously published UPLC–MS/MS method.24 Because of the low recovery of PAF in Tyrode’s buffer,
PAF secretion was measured from platelets incubated in phosphate buffered
saline (free of Ca2+ and Mg2+, containing 1
g/L glucose). A BCA protein assay was used for normalization of the
results to prevent any differences in the data due to pelleting differences
between control and phospholipid-incubated platelets. Ensemble platelet
secretion measurements are reported as secreted species per microgram
of pelleted protein.

Total Protein Quantitation
Total
protein in pelleted
platelets was quantified with a Pierce bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay
from Thermo Scientific, used as directed. Protein was extracted from
platelet pellets with mammalian protein extraction reagent from Thermo
Scientific, used as directed.

Carbon-Fiber Microelectrode
Amperometry Measurements
CFMA experiments were performed
as previously described.26,27After incubation with
the phospholipid of interest, a drop of the
washed platelets was added to an experimental chamber filled with
Tyrode’s buffer supplemented with the phospholipid of interest.
A 7-μm-diameter carbon-fiber microelectrode (fabricated in house)
was placed onto an individual platelet using piezoelectric micromanipulators,
and then the platelet was activated by local application of Tyrode’s
buffer containing 10 U/mL thrombin solution. With an applied potential
of 700 mV versus a Ag/AgCl reference at the carbon-fiber microelectrode,
serotonin secretion from δ-granules was measured as current
versus time for 90 s after the stimulation. Each phospholipid condition
was compared with its own control measured from the same platelet
sample on the same day. Each current spike was analyzed, and the aggregate
data from at least 20 individual platelets was treated statistically
as has been previously described.23,28

Results
and Discussion
Relative Quantitation of Phospholipids
Quantitation
of lipid species presents an analytical chemistry challenge due to
the limited solubility of phospholipids in solvents commonly used
for liquid chromatography. Herein, relative phospholipid enrichment
of platelet membranes was assessed using an UPLC–MS/MS method.
Mobile phase composition and column selection were based on previously
published work reported by Rainville and Plumb,20 and chromatography was modified from the same report to
a 7 min separation by adjusting the chromatographic conditions to
optimize elution for each compound. An absolute quantification method
was not possible because the phospholipid standards contained mixtures
of fatty acid tails with a common headgroup, but this relative quantitation
method can be adjusted for use with many phospholipids of interest.
Fragmentation transitions for the primary component of each phospholipid
were monitored, and lipids extracted from phospholipid-incubated platelets
were compared to those extracted from control platelets. Phospholipid
concentration values were then normalized to extracted protein values
from platelet pellets incubated with phospholipids and washed under
the same conditions as the platelets from which the phospholipids
were extracted. Calibration curves were prepared to ensure a linear
detector response over the relevant phospholipid concentration range.
Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) transitions that were used for
phospholipid enrichment assessment are given in Table 1. All phospholipid transitions were monitored in all platelet
samples. For phosphatidylserines (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamines
(PE), enrichment was observed for the phospholipid in which the platelets
had been incubated (Table 1). Thus, 2 h incubation
was enough time for platelets to take up exogenous phospholipid. This
allowed a direct comparison of the effect of enrichment of each particular
phospholipid on platelet secretion and adhesion behavior. The percent
increase in phospholipid content was 808 ± 59 and 18.7 ±
7.5 for PS and PE conditions, respectively (Table 1). This study is the first to demonstrate that platelets exposed
to exogenous phospholipids can take them up and can do so preferentially.
The aforementioned errors in phospholipid enrichment are the standard
deviations of the enrichment. Surprisingly, the % enrichment for PS
incubation was drastically higher than the enrichment for PE.

Platelets were incubated
with each of the phospholipids for 2 h,
long enough to enrich the platelets with the phospholipid of interest
but short enough to minimize de novo regulation of other phospholipids.
The drastically larger PS enrichment compared to PE enrichment is
potentially due to a paucity of the particular PS species monitored
in control platelets, which results in a much larger relative increase.

In addition to PS and PE, effects of incubation with the phospholipids
sphingomyelin (SM) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) were also examined.
While these two phospholipids influenced platelet secretion and adhesion
behavior, incubation with PC and SM did not consistently result in
enrichment of the phospholipid with which the platelets were incubated.
Effects of PC and SM on platelet behavior can be found in the Supporting Information.

Phospholipids and Platelet
Adhesion
The effect of plasma
membrane phospholipid content on platelet adhesion was assessed on
an endothelial cell-coated microfluidic platform to mimic in vivo
vascular conditions. Consistent with other assessments described herein,
fluorescently labeled platelets were incubated with PE or PS prior
to injection through the endothelial cell-coated microfluidic channel.
A short video of platelets flowing through the endothelial cell-coated
channel can be found in the Supporting Information. In the microfluidic adhesion experiments, adenosine diphosphate
(ADP) was used to activate platelets. The use of ADP as the stimulus
makes it possible to decouple investigation of adhesion from that
of secretion because ADP is known to induce platelet adhesion without
initiating secretion.29 While the adhesion
of ADP-activated platelets from each condition was relatively consistent,
the number of platelets adhered to endothelial cells varied from day
to day; as such, comparisons of platelet adhesion to endothelial cells
under each phospholipid condition were calculated with respect to
the number of control platelets adhered to endothelial cells.

The ratios measured for each condition were tested to see if they
were statistically different from the value 1 because a ratio of 1
indicates the same number of adhered platelet in the control and phospholipid-enriched
platelets. As seen in Figure 1, platelets enriched
with PS showed reduced adherence to endothelial cells compared to
the control condition (0.625 ± 0.075, p = 0.004).
In contrast, platelets enriched with PE adhered to the endothelial
layer in significantly higher numbers, with a ratio of 1.55 ±
0.02 (p = 0.04). Preincubation with either PC or
SM also resulted in suppressed adhesion (Supporting
Information).

Figure 1 Platelet adhesion measurements. (A) Schematic of microfluidic
platelet
adhesion experiment with light microscopy inset showing platelets
adhering to the endothelial cell layer. (B) Ratio of the number of
platelets adhered to the endothelial cell layer at each phospholipid
enrichment condition compared to the control.

Although PS is mostly known for its procoagulant function,
PS enrichment
in fact diminished the platelet adhesion compared to control platelets.
Besides providing a negatively charged surface to facilitate the binding
of the coagulant factors, flipping PS from the inner leaflet of the
plasma membrane to the outer leaflet provides reorganization of the
coagulation proteins in the plasma membrane. Upon PS incubation, it
is likely that the PS concentration on the outer leaflet of the platelet
membrane increased and impaired the translocation of the endogenous
PS from the inner leaflet to the outer leaflet, thus diminishing the
reorganization of the coagulation proteins that would facilitate platelet
adhesion to endothelial cells. Moreover, since PS is negatively charged,
PS enrichment of the platelet membrane will increase the anionic character
of the membrane and prevent its interactions with other cells due
to electrostatic repulsion. This observation is in agreement with
previous findings in which the higher plasma level of PS decreased
platelet coagulation and thrombus formation.7,30 Unlike
PS, PE enrichment increased the positive charge on the platelet membrane
and boosted platelet adhesion by causing 50% more platelet adhesion
than control platelets. Previous work published by Zieseniss et al.
showed that oxidized PE is one of the major components of low density
lipoproteins that cause very strong thrombotic function.31 A similar effect explains the observations of
this work and reveals that PE synthesis and oxidation may be a good
target for thrombosis prevention.

Assessment of α-Granule,
δ-Granule, Lysosomal Release
and PAF Secretion at Altered Phospholipid Levels with Ensemble Secretion
Assays
Bulk secretion assays were performed under conditions
with phospholipid enrichment. In all cases, the amount of secreted
molecules from each type of granule was normalized according to platelet
protein content. Platelet factor 4 (PF4) was measured from
α-granules, serotonin was measured from δ-granules, β-hexosaminidase
was measured from lysosomes, and platelet-activating factor (PAF)
was measured as it was manufactured from platelet lipid membranes.

Each of the measured species was selected because of their important
physiological functions, both in platelets and across other immune
cell classes. The protein content of α-granules includes soluble
proteins that are secreted to promote coagulation as well as proteins
that are bound to the external platelet surface during activation.32−34 PF4, a soluble secreted protein, promotes blood clotting
through binding to circulating anticoagulation molecules such as heparin.35 δ-granules influence coagulation through
storage and secretion of small biogenic amines, polyphosphate, Ca2+, ADP, and ATP. Because of its electroactive nature, serotonin
can be detected at the single-platelet and bulk-suspension level,
making it an ideal a marker of δ-granule secretion.

Lysosomes
contain acid hydrolases, which are a class of enzymes
found in other secretory cells including mast cells and polymorphonuclear
leukocytes.25,36 While the secretion of δ-granules
and α-granules from platelets has been studied extensively,
relatively little is known about platelet lysosomal secretion. β-Hexosaminidase
(β-Hex) is easily assayed using an absorbance measurement and
is widely used as a marker of acid hydrolase activity. As its name
suggests, PAF is a secreted phospholipid that is widely regarded as
a potent contributor to the platelet activation cascade. Additionally,
PAF is secreted from and acts on many other cell types, including
macrophages, mast cells, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes.37

Ensemble assay results show that an increase
in the PS content
impairs both α- and δ-granule secretion as well as lysosomal
secretion. While control platelets secreted 0.043 ± 0.011 μmol
of serotonin/μg of protein upon stimulation with thrombin, PS
incubation led to a significant decrease in the average amount of
δ-granule-localized serotonin secreted to 0.015 ± 0.010
μmol serotonin/μg protein (Figure 2D; p = 0.008). A more drastic effect was observed
in α-granule secretion; upon PS enrichment, PF4 secretion
was completely attenuated, as PF4 values were not significantly
different (p = 0.2) from those of the unactivated
platelets (Figure 2B). PS also impairs lysosomal
secretion and PAF secretion, though to a lesser extent than α-
and δ-granule secretion. However, unlike α- and δ-granular
release, lysosomal secretion and PAF secretion were unchanged by PE
enrichment compared to control platelets.

During exocytosis, phospholipids
not only serve as a matrix, accommodating
essential proteins for membrane fusion but, by controlling the fluidity
and curvature of the membrane, they influence the energy required
for each step of exocytosis, especially the formation and stability
of the granule-cell membrane fusion pore.17,38−41 It is clear from literature precedent that phospholipids interact
with the exocytotic machinery and, moreover, that there are specific
subunits of proteins involved in recruitment and secretion of exocytotic
granules.42,43 A similar scenario may be true for lysosomal
release where specific interactions of PE are required. Although phospholipid
regulation of lysosomal function has been reported in other cell types44 there is not any precedent work either with
evaluation of increased cellular phospholipid content or on platelets;
thus, future work will explore these data further.

Platelets,
like many other eukaryotic cell types, secrete bioactive
lipids that are enzymatically synthesized from phospholipids, and
it is interesting to consider that changes in the composition of the
phospholipid bilayer may influence de novo-generated bioactive lipids.
The interactions between phospholipids and circulating or membrane-bound
enzymes are clearly necessary for bioactive lipid generation. Herein,
PS enrichment suppressed PAF secretion, although similar effects were
not observed with PE enrichment. This could be a result of the different
degrees of enrichment of PS and PE or different action of the two
species. For example, suppression of PAF secretion upon enrichment
with PS could be a result of increased interactions between PS and
the enzymes responsible for PAF synthesis (phospholipase A2 and lyso-PAF acetyltransferase) that result in suppression of enzyme
activity or suppression of enzyme interaction with phosphatidylcholine.

Effect of Phospholipids on Single Platelet δ-Granule Secretion
While the ensemble assays clearly indicate that phospholipid content
influences platelet secretion, mechanistic insight about why or how
these changes occur would be helpful. In fact, because δ-granules
contain electroactive serotonin, CFMA can be employed to achieve biophysical
understanding of the phospholipid influence on platelet secretion.
The submillisecond time resolution of the CFMA technique enables a
detailed characterization and comparison of the δ-granule secretion
in control and phospholipid-enriched platelets.26 Parameters analyzed for each δ-granule, manifested
in amperometric traces as individual current spikes, include the total
secreted serotonin (Q), kinetics of secretion (t1/2), total number of granule fusion events
per platelet (N), and the percent of fusion events
that exhibit a foot feature. In amperometric analysis of exocytosis,
the presence of a foot feature (a small increase in measured current
that is immediately adjacent to a large “full fusion”
current spike) reveals information about the stability of the membrane
fusion pore that forms prior to dilation of the pore for more complete
chemical messenger secretion. The numbers of individual platelets
analyzed using CFMA per phospholipid condition were (control = 47,
PE = 27); (control = 20, PS = 18); (control = 20, PC = 21); and (control
= 58, SM = 45).

Although incubation of the platelets with PE
resulted in enrichment of this phospholipid, PE-enriched platelets
did not show a significant change in δ-granule secretion (Figure 3). The number of events with a foot feature was also not significantly
changed with PE incubation compared to the control condition (p = 0.08).

Figure 3 Effect of PE on δ-granule quantal release and release
kinetics.
(A) PE did not influence the amount of serotonin released from single
δ-granules. Kinetics of the release (B and C) were also unchanged.
(D) Similar numbers of δ-granules were exocytosed from individual
platelets with comparable fusion pore stability (E). Cumulative frequencies
of the release are similar for each condition (F). (G) Representative
amperometric traces from a control platelet (top) and PE-enriched
platelet (bottom). Thrombin was applied for 3 s, as indicated by the
black bar on traces in part G.

Figure 4 Effect of PS on δ-granule quantal release and release kinetics.
(A) PS did not influence the amount of serotonin released from single
granules. Similar Trise (B) but higher T1/2, **p = 0.005 (C) values
were obtained, indicating slower chemical messenger secretion with
enriched PS. (D) The number of granules exocytosed from single platelets
did not change. (E) PS increased fusion pore stability, *p = 0.05. (F) Cumulative frequency analysis shows initially fast but
later slowed granule trafficking in PS-enriched platelets. (G) Representative
amperometric traces from a control platelet (top) and PE-enriched
platelet (bottom). Thrombin was applied for 3 s, as indicated by the
black bar on traces in part G.

In contrast, PS, the most significantly enriched phospholipid
of
those considered, did induce platelet δ-granule secretion alterations
(Figure 4). Upon PS enrichment, the amount
of chemical messenger secreted per granule (the quantal secretion)
did not change (Q = 263 ± 36 fC vs 318 ±
29 fC for control and PS conditions, respectively; p = 0.2). Since the average number of granules secreted from individual
platelets also did not change between these conditions, it can be
concluded that the total amount of serotonin secretion per platelet
does not change with PS enrichment. This contradicts the bulk serotonin
secretion measurement done using HPLC where enriched PS lowered the
amount of secreted serotonin. Since single cell measurements are performed
by measuring the action of one cell at a time in a relatively isolated
space, it is unlikely that the activated secretion of one platelet
can have a downstream effect of activation on another one. In a bulk
suspension of platelets, however, activated platelets can secrete
chemical messenger species that have the downstream effect of activating
other platelets. By combining both single cell and ensemble measurements
of platelet function, this study reveals insight into both the platelet
behavior at the cellular level as well as the behavior of platelets
in a suspension where they can influence one another. Ensemble measurements
yield insight into the downstream effects of platelet activation and
the feedback loops involved in platelet function. The discrepancy
between the single cell and ensemble measurement indicates that the
downstream effect of activated platelets on the larger platelet population
is important. However, without single cell measurements, it is not
possible to observe the actual response to the stimulation nor the
heterogeneity in the response among a population of platelets.

Although CFMA reveals a similar amount of serotonin is extruded
from platelet granules in both control and PS-enriched conditions,
the secretion kinetics slow at higher membrane PS concentrations (t1/2 values are 12.4 ± 3.0 and 21.7 ±
2.4 ms for control and PS conditions, respectively; p = 0.005). While the number of granules secreted from individual
platelets (N values) did not change, the platelets
enriched with PS appear to have two different phases in terms of time
evolution of exocytosis (Figure 4F). In the
early phase, the granules that were docked before activation are released
with a comparable frequency to the control condition. However, the
frequency of the granular secretion decreases as the cell secretion
continues, showing slower granule trafficking and docking compared
to the control condition. This implies a regulatory effect of PS on
granular recruitment but not docking. Finally, fusion pore analysis
showed that PS enrichment increases the stability of the fusion pore,
with foot events occurring in 23.6 ± 4.6% of the total secretion
events, compared to 12.4 ± 3.0% foot events observed for the
control.

Although PE supports negative membrane curvature, PS
packs better
on positively curved membranes. The role of phospholipid curvature
in exocytosis becomes more prominent during fusion pore formation.17,38−41 Fusion pores are highly curved membrane structures that require
phospholipids with positive curvature to pack in the outer leaflet
and the phospholipids with negative curvature to pack on the inner
leaflet for stabilization. To achieve a stable fusion pore, the phospholipid
with appropriate curvature should be on the appropriate side of the
membrane. Although PE incubation slightly increased the % of foot
events, the changes were not significant (p = 0.08).
While it is known that the lipids with negative curvature stabilize
the fusion pore better, PS (with positive curvature) provided more
stable fusion pores compared to untreated platelets. This can be attributed
to the exposed PS on the surface of the membrane upon activation which
stabilizes the positive curvature of the fusion pore. Previous work
has reported that the time of PS transport from the inner leaflet
to the outer leaflet of the membrane is 3 min.7 During 90 s of amperometric recordings, it is likely that more than
half of the PS was exposed to the plasma outer surface. Moreover,
previous work demonstrated that PC12 cells exposed to PS also displayed
more stable fusion pore events; this was attributed to the interaction
of PS with synaptotagmin, giving rise to a high negative curvature
membrane.17,38−41,45 Platelets have synaptotagmin-like protein 1, and its interaction
with PS is not known but certainly may follow a similar behavior.46

Conclusions
Herein, this study has
demonstrated the utility of platelets as
a tool for understanding how different phospholipids can act on different
aspects of platelet function. Platelets were exposed to two of the
most common inner-leaflet phospholipids, PS and PE, and this study
demonstrates that platelets can incorporate exogenous phospholipids
into their membranes. Results indicated that enrichment of PS generally
suppresses platelet function, and although PE at the enriched level
does not affect platelet α- and δ-granule secretion, it
overactivates the thrombotic function of platelets. Moreover, this
work highlights the possibility of interaction between phospholipids
and important proteins involved in the secretion process, and the
results and methods herein can be easily applied to other mammalian
cell types using analogous cellular machinery. Elucidating the function
of lipid–protein interactions will improve our current understanding
of platelet secretion since it is obvious that the platelet secretion
is regulated synergistically by both protein and lipid species.
