Glycopeptide-centric
mass spectrometry has become a popular approach
for studying protein glycosylation. However, current approaches still
utilize fragmentation schemes and ranges originally optimized and
intended for the analysis of typically much smaller unmodified tryptic
peptides. Here, we show that by merely increasing the tandem mass
spectrometry m/z range from 2000
to 4000 during electron transfer higher energy collisional dissociation
(EThcD) fragmentation, a wealth of highly informative c and z ion
fragment ions are additionally detected, facilitating improved identification
of glycopeptides. We demonstrate the benefit of this extended mass
range on various classes of glycopeptides containing phosphorylated,
fucosylated, and/or sialylated N-glycans. We conclude that the current
software solutions for glycopeptide identification also require further
improvements to realize the full potential of extended mass range
glycoproteomics. To stimulate further developments, we provide data
sets containing all classes of glycopeptides (high mannose, hybrid,
and complex) measured with standard (2000) and extended (4000) m/z range that can be used as test cases
for future development of software solutions enhancing automated glycopeptide
analysis.

==== Body
Glycosylation
is one of the
most common and complex protein post-translational modifications that
is involved in a myriad of biological processes,1 while changes in glycosylation have been observed in a
number of pathological states.2−6 However, due to the
heterogeneity of glycan structures associated with glycoproteins,
accurate analysis of protein glycosylation still poses a significant
analytical challenge. Currently, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of
the most popular approaches used for characterization of protein glycosylation.
MS analysis of released glycans (glycomics) is the best-established
method for analyzing glycosylation. It provides great insight into
fine variations of glycan structures and is amenable to high throughput
and automated data analysis.7 Unfortunately,
in glycomic analysis, information about the underlying protein carrier
and its site-specific modification is not retained.

To determine
the glycan structures and their site of attachment,
analysis of intact glycopeptides is essential. However, glycopeptide
analysis still poses a significant analytical challenge on multiple
levels:8−10 (a) lower ionization efficiency of glycopeptides
when compared to their nonmodified counterparts; (b) the heterogeneity
of glycan structures associated with each modified site; (c) their
generally more complicated tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragmentation
spectra; and (d) the lack of adequate software tools for confident
data analysis. For this reason, most of glycopeptide studies have
been focused on the characterization of glycopeptides obtained from
isolated glycoproteins. This was also due to reliance on collision
induced dissociation fragmentation techniques that provide spectra
rich in glycan fragments but produce very few peptide backbone cleavages.
Recently, we introduced a hybrid fragmentation technique combining
electron transfer dissociation and higher energy dissociation11 (EThcD) that has become a de facto method of choice for intact glycopeptide characterization.12−21 The benefit of EThcD is that it provides a rich series of c/z ions
pinpointing the site of modification while also providing insight
into the glycan composition. Additionally, there has been a surge
of studies characterizing intact glycopeptides from complex mixtures
such as plasma/serum,19,22−24 cell lysates,25,26 and various tissues.19,27−29 One of the
main challenges observed in all of these studies is that the underlying
data analysis still requires a great degree of manual validation.
A possible cause of this is that in contrast to general proteomics
and phosphoproteomic approaches in glycoproteomics, we, by using the
standard instrument settings, almost never observe complementary ion
fragments that would retain the glycan side chain, hampering confidence
in site identification.

We here hypothesized that this is primarily
due to the fact that
most approaches for glycoproteomics are still based on well-established
bottom-up proteomics workflows optimized for unmodified tryptic peptides,
ignoring the fact that N-glycopeptides fall more within the realm
of middle-down proteomics (3–10 kDa). In this work, we show
that by merely extending the EThcD fragmentation range up to 4000 m/z (from the standard 2000), we observe
several additional fragment ions and a rich series of complementary
c and z ions that all together lead to a more complete sequence coverage
and increased confidence in glycan annotation. We demonstrate the
benefits of this workflow on (a) mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) glycopeptides
enriched from a CHO cell lysate using Fe3+-IMAC, (b) complex
sialylated glycopeptides enriched by strong anion exchange (SAX) from
CHO cell lysate, and (c) human milk glycopeptides harboring complex
and multiply fucosylated N-glycans enriched by HILIC. We provide exemplary
standard and extended mass range EThcD fragmentation spectra for each
glycan class and demonstrate that the extended m/z range provides a wealth of previously ignored informative
fragment ions for each glycan class. Additionally, we noticed that
the most commonly used software tool for the analysis of EThcD data,
Byonic, underestimates the benefits of our extended range approach
due to the arbitrary cut off of m/z 2500 in their scoring algorithm. Therefore, we make here publicly
available the extensive data sets obtained both with standard and
extended m/z range that cover all
the classes of glycopeptides with the aim to use them as test sets
for software development benefiting the rapidly growing field of glycoproteomics.

Experimental
Procedure
The CHO cell sample (a kind gift from Henrik Clausen,
University
of Copenhagen) was lysed in the lysis buffer and sonicated. Next,
methanol–chloroform protein precipitation was performed, and
the protein precipitate was digested overnight. Fe3+-IMAC
enrichment was performed as described previously.30 The flowthrough of the Fe3+-IMAC was loaded
onto a Hypersep SAX cartridge (ThermoFisher Scientific, Germany) to
enrich for glycopeptides missed by the initial Fe3+-IMAC
enrichment. The human milk sample was subjected to centrifugation
and ultracentrifugation to obtain the milk serum. After digestion,
the human milk glycopeptides were enriched on a GlykoPrep cartridge
(ProZyme, Denmark). Nanoflow liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS was
performed by coupling an Agilent 1290 (Agilent Technologies, Middelburg,
Netherlands) to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos (Thermo Scientific, Bremen,
Germany). The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent acquisition
mode. We used a HCD-pd-EThcD method where EThcD was triggered upon
observation of signature glycan oxonium ions during HCD fragmentation.
All samples were run with two different methods: (a) the MS/MS range
was set from 120 to 2000 or (b) the MS/MS range was set between 120
and 4000. Data were analyzed with Byonic (ver. 2.15.10) (Protein Metrics
Inc., United States) and searched against the CHO UniProt database
(34 962 entries) or focused human milk database (1259 entries).
CHO samples were searched with a Byonic database of 182 glycans (with
M6P glycoforms added in manually), while milk samples were searched
with a database containing 309 glycans. A more detailed description
of each part of the protocol can be found in the Supporting Information. Raw and fasta files have been deposited
to MassIVE with the identifier: MSV000083710.

Results and Discussion
In recent years, there has been an increased interest in characterization
of intact glycopeptides from complex mixtures.31,32 This has been mainly enabled by the development of hybrid fragmentation
techniques such as EThcD, stepped HCD,33,34 and AI-ETD.27 Of note, all these recently reported comprehensive
glycopeptide analyses seem to take the standard m/z 2000 as a cutoff in their analyses.

Series
of complementary fragment ions (e.g., b/y and c/z) enhance
peptide identification in standard proteomics and phosphoproteomics
approaches. However, in the characterization of intact glycopeptides,
such complementary fragment ions are (so far) hardly observed or remain
unnoticed. In our previous work reporting on the characterization
of mannose-6-phosphate glycopeptides from cell lysates, we observed
highly abundant c ion series at the high end of our MS/MS m/z range that contained intact glycans
still attached to the peptide backbone. We hypothesized that because
glycopeptides, based on their average larger intact mass (3–10
kDa), fall within the range of middle-down proteomics, an extension
of the MS/MS m/z range should give
increased confidence in their identification. To test this hypothesis,
we reanalyzed M6P glycopeptides extracted from a CHO cell lysate following
an Fe3+-IMAC enrichment and analyzed them with the conventional
(up to 2000) and extended m/z fragmentation
range (up to 4000). To illustrate our point, we reproduce in Figure 1A the EThcD spectrum
originating from a tryptic glycopeptide of palmitoyl-protein thioesterase
1, which has a M6P glycan attached at its N-terminus that produced
c1, c2, and c3 ions with intact glycan attached that we published
earlier.30 When this analysis was repeated
using an extended range of up to 4000 m/z (Figure 1A), we observed
a much fuller series of c ions spanning up to 3100 m/z covering the full sequence of the palmitoyl-protein
thioesterase 1 M6P glycopeptide.

Figure 1 Extended EThcD range results in the detection
of additional fragment
ions, increasing the sequence coverage of M6P glycopeptides. The EThcD
fragmentation spectra of three different glycopeptides are shown.
(A) GlcNAc2Man7P glycoform of palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1, (B)
GlcNAc2Man8PP glycoform of N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase, and (C)
GlcNAc2Man6P glycoform of cathepsin Z. Fragment ions are annotated
and color coded (z/y red and c blue). Peptide sequences with corresponding
glycoforms are depicted in the top right corner of each spectrum.
The range from 2000 to 4000 m/z is
shown in the shaded region magnified by a factor of 4. Green lines
and shaded c/z ions connect fragment ion pairs containing the asparagine
+ intact glycan mass increment. Shaded glycan fragment ions represent
signature M6P EThcD cleavage ions, facilitating confident glycan composition
annotation. Lower case c in the peptide sequence indicates a carbamidomethylated
cysteine.

Furthermore, when combined with
the concomitant full series of
z/y ions observed at lower m/z,
we could assign every complementary fragment ion pair, enabling full
peptide sequence coverage. Next, we focused on an M6P glycopeptide
that had its modified asparagine near its N-terminus. As depicted
in Figure 1B, the EThcD
spectrum with extended m/z range
is especially beneficial in this case as all c ion fragments containing
the intact M6P glycan are found between 2400 and 3400 m/z range and thus would be completely missed when
measured under the standard settings. More importantly, in this case,
the extended range enabled unambiguous annotation of the glycan composition,
as evidenced by the c4 and c5 fragment ions, which differ by an asparagine
with a full glycan attached. This is further supported by a signature
ion characteristic for a M6P composition arising from the core GlcNAc
cleavage, as shown in the shaded region at 1660.44 m/z in Figure 1B. Also, when the N-glycosylation site is situated near the
glycopeptide C-terminus, the extended m/z range setting performs favorably (Figure 1C). However, in this case, the range above
2000 m/z displays both c and z series,
whereby the z3–z4 and c6–c7 fragment pairs nicely show
the location of the asparagine and mass shift due to the intact glycan.
Considering that one of the observed sources of incorrect glycopeptide
annotation is due to mass coincidences between certain glycan compositions
and amino acid combinations,35 we conclude
that this issue can be avoided by having sequence coverage from both
glycopeptide termini, as demonstrated in the extended range EThcD
approach presented here.

Extended m/z Range Improves
Identification Confidence for All Classes of N-Glycopeptides
After establishing that the extended m/z range results in an increased coverage of M6P glycopeptides, we
next interrogated the performance of these settings on other classes
of glycopeptides. For this purpose, we analyzed human milk glycopeptides,
and two exemplary EThcD spectra of complex type N-glycopeptides are
depicted in Figure 2. In short, all of the observations made above for the M6P glycopeptides
also hold true for all other analyzed N-glycopeptides. Namely, in
the case of glycopeptides modified with biantennary N-glycans containing
branch fucose moieties (Figure 2A), we observed a series of insightful c ions in the 2200–3700 m/z range containing the intact glycan
as well as a c3–c4 pair, indicative for the site of the asparagine
and mass shift induced by the fucosylated biantennary N-glycan. A
similar picture arose in analyzing a glycopeptide modified with monosialylated
biantennary N-glycan (Figure 2B) where we could confidently assign the glycan composition
based on the c1–c2 glycan fragment pair and determine the full
sequence of the carrier peptide. Furthermore, various fucosylated
and hybrid glycopeptides also show a similar behavior arguing for
the use of the extended m/z range
(Figure S1A–D.) In glycoproteomics,
the analysis of multiply sialylated glycopeptides presents an even
greater challenge due to the labile nature of the sialic acid group,
especially under CID/HCD conditions. Thus, next, we analyzed multiply
sialylated glycopeptides obtained via SAX enrichment performed on
the flow-through resulting from the Fe3+-IMAC treated CHO
cell sample. An illustrative example of an EThcD spectrum with extended m/z range of a disialylated biantennary
N-glycopeptide is shown in Figure 3A. Also, for such glycopeptides, we did observe the
full series of c and z ions, resulting in the confident determination
of the glycan composition and peptide backbone sequence. However,
in contrast to what we observed in previous examples, we noticed a
series of highly abundant peaks above 1500 m/z that were not recognized by Byonic. Upon manual inspection,
we determined that these peaks correspond to sequential losses of
monosaccharides from the precursor ion (denoted by purple lines in Figure 3A). Manual inspection
also resulted in the identification of low abundant c ion series (highlighted
c ions in Figure 3A)
resulting from sequential sugar losses (Figure 3A). This could create a potential bias against
identifying sialylated glycopeptides as unexplained peaks lead to
a decrease in their Byonic scores. Additionally, we also observed
that by using the extended m/z range,
we could get sufficient sequence coverage to confidently assign the
glycan composition in some doubly N-glycosylated peptides (Figure S2A and B). This is especially significant
considering that currently in most large-scale glycoproteomics studies,
doubly glycosylated peptides are removed by default during processing
steps, as the standard m/z range
does not allow confident annotation of each of the modified sites.27 Finally, the standard m/z range spectra are usually populated with abundant oxonium
ions, peptide fragments, and sequential sugar losses from the precursor
resulting in very crowded fragmentation spectra that can result in
many ambiguities. In contrast, the m/z range between 2000 and 4000 harbors fewer ions, but they are predominantly
all c and z ions, making their identification a more straightforward
task while still preserving the same oxonium ion abundances as observed
at low m/z (Figure S3A–D).

Figure 2 Extending the EThcD range enables confident
assignment of complex
fucosylated and sialylated glycopeptides. Depicted are two EThcD fragmentation
spectra of (A) a monofucosylated biantennary glycopeptide from alpha-S1-casein
and (B) a monosialylated biantennary glycopeptide originating from
clusterin. Fragment ions are annotated and color-coded (z/y red and
c blue). Peptide sequences with corresponding glycoforms are depicted
in the top right corner of each spectrum. Green lines and shaded c
ions connect fragment ion pairs containing asparagine + intact glycan
mass increment. Lower case c in the peptide sequence indicates a carbamidomethylated
cysteine.

Figure 3 Extending the EThcD m/z range increases the confidence in glycopeptide
identifications.
(A) An example of a disialylated biantennary glycopeptide originating
from Integrin is shown. Shaded c ions represent sequential sugar losses
that are currently missed using automated annotation by Byonic. Precursor
ions with sequential sugar losses are denoted with purple lines and
were also missed by Byonic. (B) Distribution of LogP scores for M6P

To Get on Par with Standard Proteomics, Glycoproteomics
Requires
Further Development in Dedicated Software
After demonstrating
the benefits of the extended m/z range for a whole array of glycopeptide classes, we were interested
in a more global and direct comparison of the standard vs extended
range. For this purpose, we searched large sets of glycopeptide EThcD
MS/MS files with Byonic, which is one of the most popular software
solutions used in large-scale glycopeptide analyses and to our knowledge
the only tool that currently supports large scale annotation of glycopeptide
EThcD spectra. For comparison purposes, we decided to use the log
probability (LogP) score provided by Byonic, as this score takes into
account 10 different features (Byonic score, delta, mass errors, p-values, etc.), making it a good measure of the identification
confidence. A global comparison of the standard vs extended range
analysis of EThcD glycopeptide spectra is shown in Figure 3B–D. It is immediately
apparent that extending the m/z range
from 2000 to 4000 leads to an increase of median LogP of about 0.4–1
(LogP is calculated as base 10 value, so this increase represents
a 2.5–10-fold improvement) across all classes of glycopeptides
measured here, clearly demonstrating the global benefits of extended
mass range. However, it has to be noted that by using the current
Byonic version, we could only take fragment ions up to 2500 m/z into account for score calculation,
while in this work, we regularly see rich series of fragments ranging
up to 4000 m/z. This, together with
the observation that Byonic misses certain fragment ions which then
decrease the score, suggests that the real benefit of the extended m/z range is probably substantially higher.
Finally, we queried whether the substantial improvement we observed
in EThcD-based analysis of glycopeptides using the extended m/z range was also observed when using
solely HCD fragmentation (see Figure S4A–C). Notably, in the HCD-based analysis, the extended m/z range leads to hardly any improvement. We argue
that this is mainly due to the commonly observed whole glycan loss
from the peptide backbone induced by HCD fragmentation, which results
in “typical” tryptic peptide fragmentation spectra (Figure S5A–C). Furthermore, in agreement
with earlier reported studies,18,19 EThcD already outperformed
HCD for glycopeptide analysis by using the standard m/z range but even more by using the extended m/z range. This difference was most striking
when comparing the analysis of the M6P glycopeptides where the median
LogP value in HCD was around 0.5, while with EThcD it was around 2.0
using 2000 as cutoff and rose to 3.1 by using 4000 m/z, which represent increases of 50- and 400-fold
in annotation confidence, respectively. Clearly, EThcD with extended
mass range is the optimal workflow for these glycopeptides.

Conclusion
Glycopeptide analysis has benefitted greatly from the improvements
made in the more standard mass spectrometry-based proteomics. For
instance, while EThcD was originally not developed for glycopeptide
analysis, it is now clear that this hybrid fragmentation method is
surely more advantageous compared to CID/HCD for glycopeptides,33 while its benefits for unmodified tryptic peptides
are more marginal.11 Notwithstanding the
fact that glycopeptide analysis has benefited from these and other
proteomics advances (e.g., faster mass analyzers, more sensitive analyses
at higher mass resolving power), it should not be forgotten that glycopeptides
are inherently biochemically very distinct from unmodified tryptic
peptides. Therefore, we argue that standard proteomic workflows should
be critically evaluated for their performance in glycopeptide analysis.
As we show here, very simple changes in these workflows such as the
extension of the measured m/z range
in MS/MS spectra can already boost the performance, substantially
increasing the confidence of glycopeptide identification, but have
surprisingly not yet been adopted in most recent comprehensive glycopeptide
analyses.

To stimulate the much-needed further development of
glycopeptide
software solutions, we made publicly available all our raw files acquired
with both standard and extended m/z ranges, containing EThcD spectra of a wide variety of glycopeptides
that hopefully can serve as a benchmark for any future studies addressing
the challenging issue of automated glycopeptide analysis.
