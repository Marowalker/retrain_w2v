In
untargeted metabolomics
approaches, the inability to structurally
annotate relevant features and map them to biochemical pathways is
hampering the full exploitation of many metabolomics experiments.
Furthermore, variable metabolic content across samples result in sparse
feature matrices that are statistically hard to handle. Here, we introduce
MS2LDA+ that tackles both above-mentioned problems. Previously, we
presented MS2LDA, which extracts biochemically relevant molecular
substructures (“Mass2Motifs”) from a collection of fragmentation
spectra as sets of co-occurring molecular fragments and neutral losses,
thereby recognizing building blocks of metabolomics. Here, we extend
MS2LDA to handle multiple metabolomics experiments in one analysis,
resulting in MS2LDA+. By linking Mass2Motifs across samples, we expose
the variability in prevalence of structurally related metabolite families.
We validate the differential prevalence of substructures between two
distinct samples groups and apply it to fecal samples. Subsequently,
within one sample group of urines, we rank the Mass2Motifs based on
their variance to assess whether xenobiotic-derived substructures
are among the most-variant Mass2Motifs. Indeed, we could ascribe 22
out of the 30 most-variant Mass2Motifs to xenobiotic-derived substructures
including paracetamol/acetaminophen mercapturate and dimethylpyrogallol.
In total, we structurally characterized 101 Mass2Motifs with biochemically
or chemically relevant substructures. Finally, we combined the discovered
metabolite families with full scan feature intensity information to
obtain insight into core metabolites present in most samples and rare
metabolites present in small subsets now linked through their common
substructures. We conclude that by biochemical grouping of metabolites
across samples MS2LDA+ aids in structural annotation of metabolites
and guides prioritization of analysis by using Mass2Motif prevalence.

Large high-throughput
metabolomics
experiments are becoming more prevalent across many areas of medicine
and the life sciences.1,2 Analysis of the resulting data
sets is challenging and current techniques fail to extract all of
the rich structure they encapsulate. Most techniques work at the level
of individual mass features (molecules); finding those that change
systematically across experimental groups before attempting to identify
them. Although analyses sometimes map the identified molecules to
molecular networks,2,3 relationships that exist between
molecules are rarely used earlier in the analysis.

Identification
of mass features (mapping them to molecular structures)
is the main bottleneck in untargeted metabolomics. It is commonly
recognized that gas-phase mass fragmentation experiments are essential
to support metabolite annotations.4,5 The resulting
fragmentation data is complex and using it to perform annotation and
identification is challenging.4,5 Comparing measured fragment
spectra with spectral databases is largely ineffective (a recent commentary
estimated that on average around 2% of molecules in a typical experiment
could be confidently identified in this way5). Moreover, although databases will continue to grow, they can only
be populated with “known unknowns” (i.e., previously
studied molecules) hindering discovery of novel natural products or
unexpected metabolites. Focusing on individual mass features also
requires chromatographic retention time alignment across the samples
which becomes increasingly challenging as the number of samples increases
and effectively precludes comparisons between different chromatographic
platforms. Retention time alignment makes it hard to deal with molecules
that only appear in a small subset of the samples as they will often
be considered to be noise and removed. However, in some studies, molecules
of interest may appear in only a small subset of the samples (e.g.,
a drug or other xenobiotic).

One strategy to overcome these
limitations is to make better use
of fragmentation data. Recently, multiple tools have been proposed
for processing, analysis, and visualization of fragmentation data
sets.6−10 Of these, MS2Analyzer6 relies on knowledge
of the biochemistry of interest and fragment/loss patterns of importance,
which is only of limited use in experiments where the goal is to uncover unknown biochemistry. Molecular Networking7,11 groups spectra according to their overall level of similarity. Those
spectra that can be structurally identified can annotate their neighbors,
propagating metabolite annotations to previously unknown molecules.5 However, each spectrum can only belong to one
group even though many molecules consist of multiple biochemically
diverse substructures. Should adenosine, which comprises adenine and
pentose (ribose) substructures, be grouped with other adenine containing
molecules or ribose containing ones? MetFamily8 was recently introduced to sidestep the identification problem by
clustering MS2 spectra to find structural families and linking these clusters to differential expression, thereby revealing
regulated metabolite families. While this approach neatly integrates
MS1 and MS2 data, the cluster analysis does not have the flexibility
to represent molecules consisting of multiple diverse substructures.

Recently, we developed MS2LDA10 for
exploration of fragment data. On the basis of Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA),12 MS2LDA decomposes each molecule
into one or more Mass2Motifs, allowing for more efficient molecular
grouping, searching, and exploration. Mass2Motifs consist of fragments
and losses conserved across multiple spectra and often correspond
to chemical substructures. Spectra sharing a Mass2Motif can be grouped
even if the Mass2Motif only accounts for a small portion of their
spectra and, as they consist of multiple Mass2Motifs, spectra can
belong to multiple structural families. We have previously shown that
MS2LDA can decompose metabolites into biochemically relevant substructures,
such as amino acid, nucleotide, or hexose related Mass2Motifs.10

MS2LDA exploits biochemical similarities
within a single fragmentation
run (i.e., one DDA data set) and therefore does not tackle a key step
in many analyses, the direct highlighting and extraction of changes
in metabolomes across samples. Here, we introduce MS2LDA+, an extension
of MS2LDA that simultaneously analyzes multiple samples, across which
the Mass2Motifs are shared. Crucially, this sharing means we can measure
the change in prevalence of Mass2Motifs across samples allowing us
to perform differential analysis of Mass2Motifs (something that was
not possible with MS2LDA). The development of this new model is motivated
by the observation that very similar Mass2Motifs were found independently
(through manual comparison) across multiple samples.10 MS2LDA+ formalizes and automates this laborious matching
process by processing multiple samples with the same set of Mass2Motifs,
allowing us to decompose molecules from different samples into a shared
set of substructures and automatically compare the prevalence of Mass2Motifs across the samples.

To validate our MS2LDA+
model, we apply it to a data set consisting
of 19 beer samples and 22 urine samples, hypothesizing that MS2LDA+
will discover substructures with differential prevalence (i.e., substructures
that are beer and urine specific). The MS2LDA+ pipeline is then applied
to perform fragmentome-based molecular phenotyping of 22 urine samples
from a cohort of stroke patients and finally applied to a set of fecal
samples obtained from children with Crohn’s disease at different
time points during nutritional therapy. Previously, we have shown
that untargeted mass spectrometry fragmentation experiments can expose
not only the presence of different classes of antihypertensive drugs
and their metabolites in urine samples but also over-the-counter drugs
and endogenous metabolite families.13 By
applying the MS2LDA+ pipeline to discover fragmentation patterns across
urine samples, we aim to structurally characterize the discovered
urinary metabolite families. Our hypothesis is that Mass2Motifs with
highly variable prevalence, representing drug (or other xenobiotic)
substructures, appear in only a subset of samples, whereas Mass2Motifs
that display low variance represent common endogenous substructures,
such as acylcarnitines and acylglutamines.13 This paper introduces the concept of MS2LDA+ that allows for the
determination of Mass2Motif’s prevalence across multiple samples.

Material
and Methods
Materials
Urine Samples
Urine samples from
anonymized human volunteers
were used from a clinical sample set in the Glasgow Polyomics’
archive. These samples were obtained as part of a trial for which
ethical approval was applied for through the Multi-Centre Research
and Ethics Committee (MREC), which was granted by the Scottish MREC
and (with MREC No. 06/MRE00/106). Informed consent was obtained from
all individual study participants. Spot urine samples were obtained
from the cohort of elderly patients upon their first admission in
the clinic. A different subset as in13 was
chosen: urine extracts of 22 patients were selected as follows, diagnosed
with stroke, administering a variety of drugs including a number of
antihypertensives, and availability of the sample extract in the Glasgow
Polyomics’ archive. The resulting subject’s age range
spanned from 52 to 85; 13 were male, and 9 female. More details can
be found in Supporting Information section S1 and Table S1.

Beer Samples
The
10 mL samples of 18 different beers
were collected from bottles over a period of 5 months. One beer was
sampled twice from different bottles. Details can be found in the
Supporting Information section S2.

Stool
Samples
Stool samples originated from two children
with active Crohn’s disease (9.2 and 12.9 years) who received
disease induction treatment with exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN)
as described previously.14,15 Both children entered
clinical remission and their fecal calprotectin, a marker of colonic
inflammation decreased significantly at the end of their treatment.
In total, five serial stool samples were collected per patient and
a single one from two healthy controls (10.7 and 11.2 years). From
CD children, a first sample was collected before EEN, three samples
were collected during EEN (at ∼15, 30, and 56 days), and a
final sample was collected when patients returned to their habitual
diet (∼60 days after EEN cessation). Stool samples were collected
within 2 h of defecation, homogenized with mechanical kneading immediately,
and aliquots were stored at −80 °C until further analysis.
Carers and participants provided written informed consent, and the
study was approved by the local research ethics committee (Reference
Number 05/S0708/66).

Chemicals
HPLC-grade methanol, acetonitrile,
isopropanol,
and analytical reagent grade chloroform were acquired from Fisher
Scientific, Loughborough, U.K. HPLC grade H2O was purchased
from VWR Chemicals, Fountenay-sous-Bois, France. Formic acid (for
mass spectrometry) and ammonium carbonate were acquired from Fluka
Analytical (Sigma-Aldrich), Steinheim, Germany.

Methods
Sample
Preparation
A general metabolome extraction
procedure was performed:16 (i) 5 μL
urine was extracted in 200 μL of chloroform/methanol/water (1:3:1)
at 4 °C; (ii) then vortexed for 5 min at 4 °C; (iii) then
centrifuged for 3 min (13 000g) at 4 °C.
The resulting supernatant was stored at −80 °C until analysis.
A pooled aliquot of the 22 selected urine samples was prepared prior
to the LC–MS runs with DDA applying higher collision dissociation
(HCD) as in ref (13). The same procedure was followed for the 19 beer samples, see also
ref (10). Finally,
to create fecal extracts, the stool samples were freeze-dried and
5 mg of lyophilized fecal material was extracted in 200 μL of
chloroform/methanol/water (1:3:1) at 4 °C; followed by homogenization
in a FastPrep-24 homogenizer for 60 s at stroke setting 5, after which
the same procedure as for urine was followed.

Analytical Platform
A Thermo Scientific Ultimate 3000
RSLCnano liquid chromatography system (Thermo Scientific, CA) was
used. That system was coupled to a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive Orbitrap
mass spectrometer equipped with a HESI II interface (Thermo Scientific,
Hemel Hempstead, U.K.). Thermo Xcalibur Tune software (version 2.5)
was used for instrument control and data acquisition.

LC Settings
The HILIC separation was performed with
a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) equipped
with the corresponding precolumn (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany).
A linear biphasic LC gradient was conducted from 80% B to 20% B over
15 min, followed by a 2 min wash with 5% B, and 7 min re-equilibration
with 80% B, where solvent B is acetonitrile and solvent A is 20 mM
ammonium carbonate in water. The flow rate was 300 μL/min, column
temperature was maintained at 25 °C, injection volume was 10
μL, and samples were maintained at 4 °C in the autosampler.13

MS and MS/MS Settings
MS and MS/MS
settings used to
generate separate mode fragmentation files are fully described in
refs (10 and 13). In short, for
positive- and negative-ionization separate fragmentation modes, the
duty cycles consisted of a full scan in positive-ionization mode,
followed by a TopN data-dependent MS/MS (MS2) fragmentation event
taking the 10 most abundant ion species not on the dynamic exclusion
list. MS/MS fragmentation spectra were acquired using stepped higher
collision dissociation combining 25.2, 60.0, and 94.8 normalized collision
energies in one MS2 scan. In full-scan mode, the duty cycle consisted
of two full-scan events alternating positive and negative ionization
modes.

Data Acquisition and Processing
Data Acquisition
Quality control procedures from Glasgow
Polyomics were used.16 Details can be found
in the Supporting Information section S3.

Data Processing: Feature Extraction
Data, in the form
of .mzXML (full scan) and .mzML (fragmentation) files, are preprocessed
using XCMS17 and MzMatch18 for peak detection and RMassBank19 for detecting MS1–MS2 pairs, before matrix formation by aligning
MS2 features across different spectra and samples. One benefit of
working at the level of the structural families defined by MS2LDA
is that the samples can be preprocessed separately and no retention
time alignment is required. The resulting data set consists of a set
of MS2 spectra for each sample, containing fragment and loss features
(and their intensities) that have been matched across all samples
(Supporting Information section S3).

MS2LDA+ Model
The MS2LDA+ model is an extension to
standard LDA in which a single set of motifs (known as topics in standard
LDA) is shared across multiple samples. For inference, we have developed
a Variational Bayes12 scheme in which each
sample is modeled with standard MS2LDA except for the updates of the
motifs which are pooled across the samples (Supporting Information section S4). The output is a set of Mass2Motifs
and assignments of Mass2Motifs to each MS1 peak in each sample. Essentially,
all mass fragments and neutral losses are now linked across samples
to assess their co-occurrence in the entire collection of fragmentation
spectra while also storing feature matrices for each individual sample.
The extension from MS2LDA to MS2LDA+ model is depicted in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Extension from MS2LDA
to MS2LDA+. In MS2LDA, a single sample (containing M molecules) is decomposed using K Mass2Motifs.
In MS2LDA+, F samples (containing M1, M2, M3 molecules,
etc.) are decomposed onto shared Mass2Motifs. Prevalence of the Mass2Motifs
can then be compared across the samples. In this example, the red
Mass2Motif is most prevalent in the second sample, and the green in
the third.

The MS2LDA pipeline was extended
to MS2LDA+ to enable the analysis
of multiple samples in one analysis by linking all fragments and losses
and their co-occurrences across the entire corpus while storing sample-specific
information (Figure 1). In MS2LDA+, the sample-specific prevalence of the different Mass2Motifs
for the fth sample is captured by a parameter vector
αf, that has one value per Mass2Motif
(αkf) (represented by the bar
charts at the bottom of Figure 1). The higher the value, the more prevalent that Mass2Motif
is within the sample. Prevalence here can be interpreted as the proportion
of all feature intensity (of the fragmented molecules) that is explained
by this Mass2Motif. These α vectors provide a high-level view
of the biochemical makeup of each sample in terms of the prevalence
of the different, shared Mass2Motifs (Figure 1).

Following MS2LDA, we used the Mass2Motif-molecule
probabilities
to define the links between the molecules. The probability can be
interpreted as the proportion of a molecule’s spectrum that
is explained by this Mass2Motif, and it is therefore affected by the
number of peaks in the molecule’s spectrum. For example, two
molecules that both include a complete Mass2Motif would have very
different probabilities if one of them had many more other peaks.
In a further development from the original MS2LDA, we have therefore
implemented a second, complementary linking score: the overlap
score. The overlap score measures how much of the Mass2Motif
is present in the spectrum rather than how much of the spectrum is
explained by the Mass2Motif (Supporting Information section S5). The higher that score, the more mass fragments
and neutral losses from the Mass2Motif can be found in the fragmentation
spectrum of the parent ion, increasing the confidence that the substructure
is indeed present. An intrinsic model property is that all spectra
must be assigned to at least one Mass2Motif. This enforces “alien”
metabolites not sharing any substructures with other metabolites to
be part of a structural family (with very high probabilities) despite
sharing hardly any or no characteristic features. These outliers are
now easily recognized by the combination of a high membership probability
but very low overlap score.

Data Analysis
Statistical
Tools
PCA Analysis
PCA analysis was performed on the 41 ×
500 matrix of α values to project it down into a 41 × 2
matrix for visualization. The values were normalized so that the total
value within each sample was equal to 1. This allows the values to
be interpreted as Mass2Motif probabilities within each sample. The
standard approach of whitening the variables (motifs) prior to PCA
was performed. PCA analysis was done in Python using the PCA method
provided in the scikit-learn package.20

Mass2Motif differential prevalence was determined by computing
the z-score for each Mass2Motif between the two groups (difference
of α means divided by the sum of the standard deviations). As
for PCA, the α values within each sample were normalized to
sum to 1. To compute similarity between Mass2Motifs, their α
values (now the vector of values across samples for each Mass2Motif)
were compared by computing their pairwise Pearson correlation values.

Structural Characterization of Mass2Motifs
Mass2Motifs
discovered in beer and urine were structurally characterized by comparison
to earlier discovered Mass2Motifs10 and
characteristic fragments found by manual inspection of clusters in
a Molecular Network,13 through expert knowledge
and matching of the Mass2Motif spectra to reference spectra in MzCloud
(www.mzcloud.org).

Results
MS2LDA+ Exposes Biochemical Differences between
Samples
To validate the extent to which MS2LDA+ generates
biochemically relevant
knowledge from untargeted metabolomics experiments and the extent
to which αf provides a biochemical summary of each sample, sets of 19 beer and 22 urine samples
were combined in one analysis to discover 300 Mass2Motifs. Using biological
samples from two distinct origins will highlight the high-level differences
that MS2LDA+ can extract from large experiments. The prevalence of
two discovered Mass2Motifs across all the 41 samples is displayed
in Figure 2. Figure 2A–C displays
the paracetamol mercapturate with Figure 2A displaying the fragmented ions that contain
the paracetamol mercapturate Mass2Motif, Figure 2B displaying the αf across all samples, and Figure 2C showing the number of metabolites that passed a threshold
of 0.01 on their molecule-Mass2Motif probability. As can be seen,
the trend of the two histograms is very similar. The Mass2Motif is
clearly prevalent in 5 of the urine samples and present in a couple
more and virtually absent in the beer samples (those that are grouped
from beer are incidentally mass-matched metabolites sharing only one
or two abundant mass fragments), as expected since it is a human drug
related Mass2Motif. Inspection revealed that the characteristic fragmentation
pattern of paracetamol mercapturate consisting of 5 recurring fragments
is absent from those beer fragmentation spectra. Higher threshold
values on document-Mass2Motif probabilities and overlap scores would
reduce the number of such spurious hits. The acetyl loss Mass2Motif
(Figure 2D–F)
displays a completely different picture of a fairly constant number
of metabolites that contain this Mass2Motif in both beer and urine
samples with some of them present in both sample sets (see Figure 2D).

Figure 2 (A–C) Paracetamol
mercapturate Mass2Motif in beer and urine
samples with (A) metabolites displayed in m/z vs RT plot, (B) αf,
and (C) degrees. Note that the model finds (almost) no molecules from
beer (as expected) that contain the paracetamol mercapturate Mass2Motif;
those that do spuriously match are doing so because one or two abundant
fragments overlap but the characteristic paracetamol mercapturate
pattern is clearly absent from those beer fragmentation spectra. (D–F)
Acetyl loss Mass2Motif in beer and urine samples with (D) metabolites
displayed in m/z vs RT plot, (E)
αf, and (F) degrees. Note that we
observe many molecules from beer, many from urine, and many that appear
in both that contain the acetyl loss Mass2Motif.

Substructure-Based Principal Component Analysis
To
visualize the results at a higher level, principal component analysis
(PCA) was performed to project the 41 (total number of samples) αf vectors from their original 300-dimensional
space (one dimension per Mass2Motif) into two dimensions. Figure 3 shows clear separation
of the two sample groups with the Mass2Motif loadings indicated as
gray lines, highlighting the ability of MS2LDA+ to characterize complex
mixtures. We subsequently explored the Mass2Motifs with high loadings
(those that contribute most to the separation of beer and urine samples)
and found, among Mass2Motifs more prevalent in beer, choline, aminohexose,
and hexose conjugation substructures (also highlighted in Figure 3), and among those
more prevalent in urine, creatinine, trimethylamine, and acylcarnitine
substructures. The relevance of these metabolite groups to beer and
urine highlights the interpretability of the MS2LDA+ analysis; we
are able to rapidly observe biochemical differences between the sample
groups without relying on the identification of individual molecules.
In particular, beer derives partly from plant-based metabolomes rich
in glycosylated products. During brewing, sugars are released that
can react with other parts of the beer metabolite pool, resulting
in many glycosylated products. Creatinine, a byproduct of muscle metabolism
cleared from serum by the kidneys, is typically found in urine and
not in beer, as expected.

Figure 3 Principal component analysis (PCA) of 19 beer
and 22 urine samples.
The largest variance (42.7%) is explained by the differences between
the beer and urine groups. Motifs are indicated with lines and several
structurally characterized Mass2Motifs are highlighted.

Differential Prevalence of Mass2Motifs
To further explore
the differences highlighted by MS2LDA+, we performed a differential
prevalence analysis for each Mass2Motif between the two sample sets.
The 20 Mass2Motifs showing the most consistent differential prevalence
(based on a t test) for each sample were examined
(box plots in Figure 4A,B). Of these, we found many Mass2Motifs to which we could assign
a substructure or structural feature. Many Mass2Motifs prevalent in
beer were based on sugars (hexoses) and typical plant-based structural
motifs like cinnamic acid. Likewise, urine prevalent Mass2Motifs include
those structurally characterized as proline betaine and trimethylamine
substructures. It is also informative to examine the Mass2Motifs that
were unchanged between the two sample groups. These included structural
families related to the loss of CHOOH (indicative for a free carboxyl
group, present in both amino acids and organic acids) and the nucleotide
cytosine. Both urine and beer contain similar numbers of molecules
related to those structural families. Indeed, both urine and beer
contain amino acids and organic acids which both contribute to the
carboxyl loss structural family. Note that within this analysis we
are making use of information from spectra that would not be identified
by classical existing methods. Alternatively, one could look at differences
in prevalence of particular molecular families based on the families
of identified metabolites. However, such an analysis risks heavy bias:
analysis of spectral database contents reveal substantial overlap
to a relatively small set of widely abundant metabolites.21 Quantifying such bias would be near-impossible.
MS2LDA+ sidesteps the problem by considering all spectra that contain
a particular Mass2Motif.

Figure 4 Boxplots of high variance alphas abundantly
present in beer (A)
and urine (B): the top 20 most differential Mass2Motifs are displayed
and labeled with their structural characterizations.

These results show that MS2LDA+ can highlight biochemically
relevant
differences between sample groups in complex metabolomics data. Moreover,
we can rank the Mass2Motifs by their variance across the samples and
extract the Mass2Motifs that display high variance among the samples.
We hypothesize that, within urine samples, those Mass2Motifs that
exhibit high variance are likely to represent exogenous metabolites
including drugs and food-related metabolites (xenobiotics), while
those displaying lower variance are more likely to represent endogenous
metabolite families. In the following section we test this hypothesis.

Mass2Motif Variance within Urines Exposes Xenobiotic-Derived
Substructures
MS2LDA+ was used to discover 300 Mass2Motifs
in the 22 urine samples and the αf values were used to determine the variance for each Mass2Motif (note
that to compute the variance we normalized each αf so that they summed to one over the samples to remove
the effect of globally high and low prevalence Mass2Motifs). The 30
most and least variable Mass2Motifs were extracted and, where possible,
structurally characterized. Table S6-1 in
the Supporting Information, section S6, shows the 30 most variable
Mass2Motifs, 23 of which were structurally characterized as containing
a biochemically relevant substructure. Nearly all (22) of those substructures
can be described as xenobiotic (drug, food-related, or otherwise not
naturally occurring in humans). For example among the top 10 most
variable Mass2Motifs, we found substructures related to paracetamol
mercapturates (a group of metabolites derived from paracetamol, a
pain killer (see also Figure 2A–C) for which the Mass2Motif mass fragments matched
with the characteristic fragments previously determined from a Molecular
Networking cluster,13 amlodipine (an antihypertensive
diuretic), and dimethylated pyrogallol (a marker of polyphenol intake22). At the low variance end, 21 out of the 30
least variable Mass2Motifs were structurally characterized as containing
a biochemically relevant substructure (Table S6-2 in the Supporting Information, section S6). In the top 10, acetyl
loss, cytosine related, and the loss of CHOOH were found, indicating
that a constant number of metabolites contain those substructures
across the 22 different urines. An additional 57 Mass2Motifs were
structurally characterized with biochemically relevant substructures
or with related ion products including isotope variants (Table S6-3 in the Supporting Information, section
S6). Lysine, carnitine (acylcarnitine), and methyladenine are among
those motifs. A total of 101 Mass2Motifs could be structurally characterized,
covering on average ∼1600 molecules in a urine sample which
represents 86% of the total molecules for which MS/MS data were collected.

Mass2Motifs also show variation across the retention time axis
of the mass/charge versus retention time plots (Figure 5). Mass2Motifs like the loss of a pentose
(Figure 5B) occur throughout
the entire chromatographic window, whereas metabolites containing
the sartan-based Mass2Motif elute in a narrow band (Figure 5D). This can further assist
in the structural characterization of Mass2Motifs.

mass/charge (m/z) plots for fragmented
MS1 ions containing Mass2Motifs
annotated as (A) loss of glucuronide, (B) loss of pentose, (C) C10
or longer acylcarnitines, and (D) sartan related drug metabolites.
A clear difference in occurrence throughout the chromatogram can be
observed with pentose loss occurring throughout the complete RT window
while the hydrophobic sartan related drugs are confined to a narrow
RT band.

Biochemically Related Substructures
Cluster Based on Prevalence
Across Samples
(Bio)chemically related substructures (i.e.,
those created by different
pathways derived from the same core metabolite) would likely result
in similar αf profiles across the
samples. The most variable Mass2Motif was related to paracetamol mercapturates,
containing a variety of mercapturates. Pearson correlation between
the αf vectors for each sample was
used to visualize the similarity between the Mass2Motifs profiles
with edges between Mass2Motifs where their correlation exceeded a
threshold (Supporting Information, section S7). Many xenobiotic Mass2Motifs were found in isolation in the alpha
correlation network, indicating their unique prevalence across the
urine samples. Conversely, endogenous Mass2Motifs were more densely
connected. Interestingly, however, the paracetamol mercapturates Mass2Motif
was clustered not only to a Mass2Motif characterized as a paracetamol
substructure but also to a Mass2Motif that was subsequently characterized
as a group of fragments belonging to methoxyparacetamol. Hence similarities
between profiles for individual Mass2Motifs across the samples allow
us to prioritize Mass2Motifs to characterize and can assist in the
structural elucidation process.

Both paracetamol and methoxyparacetamol
were found in urines with
two metabolites, namely, the glucuronidated and sulfated form. In
our data, these metabolites were characterized by a large number of
ion products. In fact, the more paracetamol present in a urine samples,
the larger the number of observed ion products. The α values
for this Mass2Motif could so be used as a proxy for abundance of those
two metabolite families in urine.

In summary, ranking Mass2Motifs
by their variance in α guided
the extraction of xenobiotic substructures and their associated metabolites
in an unsupervised manner. Furthermore, the Mass2Motif α distributions
can be used to find biochemically related substructures that can aid
in their structural characterization.

Core and Rare Metabolites
Grouped by MS2LDA+
A variety of structural families were
discovered by MS2LDA+ across
the urine profiles in positive mode experiments, including trimethylamine,
indole, loss of pentose, loss of glucuronide, glycine, carnitine,
and glutamine related Mass2Motifs. We investigated the carnitine and
glutamine families in more details to validate the grouping performed
by MS2LDA+. After aligning the MS1 features across the samples, the
sample and metabolite normalized MS1 intensities were examined to
divide the grouped metabolites into “core” (here defined
as present in >80% of urine samples) and “rare” (here
defined as present in <80% of urine samples) metabolites. In total,
59 acylcarnitine species were annotated, 47 of which were core acylcarnitines
(Supporting Information, section S8). HMDB23 entries were found for 30% of the annotated
core acylcarnitines, whereas none were found for the 12 annotated
rare acylcarnitines Supporting Information, section S9). Many of the discovered acylcarnitines were also annotated
in previous studies that required more laborious manual annotation.13,24 This demonstrates a key advantage of working with metabolite families
represented by Mass2Motifs, the ability to make use of data that cannot
be identified through traditional means.

The acylglutamine family
resulted in 23 annotated core acylglutamines
(Supporting Information, section S10),
of which 3 had hits in HMDB. In total, four nonpeptide glutamine related
metabolites are present in HMDB. During annotation of the grouped
features, 5 acylglutamine-related ion products were found (isotopes
and fragments) and 3 occurrences of cofragmentation of nonacylglutamines.
None of the 12 annotated rare acylglutamines (Supporting Information, section S11) had a match in HMDB. An earlier
study13 using Molecular Networking revealed
a number of acylglutamine species; however, MS2LDA+ was able to find
a larger variety of these species.

Thus, MS2LDA+ allows for
mapping of structural families across
samples, grouping both features present across all samples as well
as those present in just a subset of samples (that would often be
discarded in traditional analysis). Performing statistical analysis
based on metabolite families allows the use of all related molecules,
not just the handful that can be identified by database matching.
Only a few acylglutamine species found a match in HMDB, indicating
how the grouping by MS2LDA+ aids in structural annotation of features
found in untargeted metabolomics experiments. Additionally, the (sample
and metabolite) normalized MS1 intensities give insight into abundance
and presence/absence patterns within metabolite families which can
be grouped within Mass2Motifs using biclusters (Supporting Information, section S12).

Stool Sample Analysis of
Children with Crohn’S Disease
during Nutritional Therapy
Fecal extracts represent a challenging
matrix influenced by many
factors such as diet, drug administration, gut microbiota, and the
host metabolome. Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory
condition of the gut for which no curable treatment is available.
To study metabolic differences during disease induction treatment
with exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN),14,15 samples from
children with Crohn’s disease and healthy controls were analyzed
with MS2LDA+ (see the Supporting Information, section S13). The substructure-based PCA showed separation
of samples taken during treatment versus samples taken after treatment
and from healthy controls (Supporting Information, Figure S13A), indicating commonalities between gut substructure
contents of healthy controls and patients that had completed treatment.
Differential prevalence analysis showed adenine and guanine substructures
being depleted in the during-treatment samples, as is also shown in
the topic prevalence plots for selected Mass2Motifs (Figure S13B–D).

Discussion
State-of-the-art
mass spectrometers can measure the concentrations
and fragmention spectra of small molecules with increasing resolution
and coverage, thus improving our chances of discovering biomarkers
for the onset of disease and food or drug intake. However, mass spectrometers
generate data sets that are very complex and currently tools for analysis
use only a small part of the available data.

Unsupervised discovery
of substructures in metabolomics data represents
a significant step forward in analysis of MS/MS-based metabolomics
data.10 However, armed with that information,
the researcher is still tasked with numerous mass fragmental patterns
to analyze. Relevant or informative Mass2Motifs are not always present
in many metabolites, while small structural families can play crucial
roles in biological experiments. Motivated by the observation that
Mass2Motifs were similarly defined across different samples, we extended
the MS2LDA model to MS2LDA+. MS2LDA+ decomposes multiple samples using
a shared set of Mass2Motifs. As well as decomposing each individual
molecule into its constituent Mass2Motifs, MS2LDA+ exposes higher
level biochemical variability across samples through extracting the
sample-specific Mass2Motif prevalence. Differential prevalence and
variability of this prevalence can also guide exploration of relevant
structural families in metabolomics experiments.

When performing
a MS2LDA+ analysis of a collection of beer and
urine samples, Mass2Motif prevalence clearly separated the two sample
types, demonstrating its ability to extract high-level biochemical
changes. Mass2Motifs with high differential prevalence between sample
groups made sense in the context of the known biochemical makeup of
these complex mixtures. When analyzing the urine samples alone, ranking
Mass2Motifs by their variance highlighted xenobiotic Mass2Motifs whereas
low variance Mass2Motifs tended to represent endogenous substructures.
For example, the most variable Mass2Motif was related to paracetamol
mercapturates, human metabolites of paracetamol (APAP). This highlighted
the utility of the MS2LDA+ approach in the extraction of xenobiotic
(e.g., drug) substructures (and hence metabolites) from untargeted
experiments. Furthermore, MS2LDA+ separated stool samples from children
with Crohn’s disease during ENN treatment with those after
treatment and healthy controls. Substructure analysis revealed significant
differential prevalence for a few Mass2Motifs, with adenine and guanine
substructures being depleted during treatment. Interestingly, there
is evidence that small molecules related to adenine and guanine may
play roles in gut microbiota homeostasis and inflammatory response.25,26 In future, with time-series LC–MS/MS data available for more
volunteers, multivariate substructure analysis (explicitly accounting
for changes over time) is a promising route to explore. In total,
101 Mass2Motifs were structurally annotated with biochemically relevant
substructures. These Mass2Motifs were present in 86% of fragmented
molecules (at a cutoff of 0.1 probability score, dropping to 49% at
a more stringent cutoff of 0.3), demonstrating the wide coverage that
can be obtained in untargeted experiments via the characterization
of far fewer Mass2Motifs than original molecules. We are currently
considering how to store this structural information in such a way
that it can be easily transferred to new experiments and how to make
it searchable for the scientific community, for example, by converting
them into MassBank records.27

The
acylcarnitine and acylglutamine metabolite families were investigated
in detail and their members partitioned into “core”
and “rare” metabolites (Supporting Information sections S8–S11). The grouping of those
core metabolites could also allow prioritization of Mass2Motif characterization
to those which display large variation in their core metabolite MS1
intensities, as those which are much more likely to produce potential
markers than low-variant metabolites or metabolites that are only
present in a subset of samples due to limitations of currently used
statistical approaches. Biclusters aid in assessment of structural
family membership and highlight presence/absence patterns across different
samples (Supporting Information, section S12).

Conclusions and Outlook
We introduce MS2LDA+ that provides
a platform to guide interpretation
of comparative untargeted metabolomics experiments and prioritize
structural characterization of Mass2Motifs across large sample sets.
We believe that the unsupervised discovery of substructures has particular
utility for the detection of unknown unknowns (molecules
not previously encountered in chemical databases). Moreover, by finding
the biochemical relationships between metabolites, we can deal with
the gaps in the MS1 data matrix that classical statistical approaches
cannot currently do without data imputation strategies.

With
beer and urine samples as two distinct groups, we validated
that biochemically relevant information is discovered by MS2LDA+,
allowing for prioritization of compound classes and groups that contribute
to substantial variation in the data. This approach can find relevant
substructures and/or substructures of both endogenous and exogeneous
origin in urine cohort samples where intragroup variance was suspected
to arise from differential drug and/or food administration. In total,
we structurally characterized 101 Mass2Motifs discovered in urine.
We found that the most variable urinary substructures were xenobiotic-derived.

Substructure-based metabolomics captures most structural information
present in fragmentation-enriched untargeted metabolomics experiments.
The discovery of structural families in this way will impact many
different fields of science. For example, it will be useful in relating
lifestyle factors (diet, medicinal use, other exposures) to urinary
markers, for monitoring production of natural products in bacteria
and plants and monitoring toxic degradation products in wastewater.
Moreover, where biochemical pathways are characterized by shared substructures,
perturbations in those pathways upon treatments are also likely to
be discovered by MS2LDA+ using Mass2Motif differential prevalence
analysis. To fulfill the promise of untargeted metabolomics, unsupervised
inclusive methods like MS2LDA+ are needed that make use of the biochemical
relationships of metabolites and group metabolites per functional
group or substructure.
