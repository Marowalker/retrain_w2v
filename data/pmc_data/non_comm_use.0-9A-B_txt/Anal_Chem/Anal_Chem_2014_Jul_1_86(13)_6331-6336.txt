We report the use of the dynamic
pH junction based capillary zone
electrophoresis-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (CZE-ESI-MS/MS)
for bottom-up proteomics with an electrokinetically pumped sheath-flow
nanospray capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) interface
and both LTQ-XL and LTQ-Orbitrap-Velos mass spectrometers. Conventional
injection of 20 nL of a 1 mg/mL BSA digest identified 37 peptides
and produced 66% sequence coverage. In contrast, pH junction injection
of 130 nL (or larger) of a 0.05 mg/mL BSA digest identified 40 peptides
and produced 70% coverage using a pH 6.5 sample buffer and the LTQ.
A 20 nL conventional injection of a 1 mg/mL Escherichia coli digest identified 508 peptides and 199 proteins with the LTQ. A
400 nL pH junction injection of a 0.1 mg/mL E. coli digest identified 527 peptides and 179 proteins with the LTQ. Triplicate
technical replicates of a 0.01 mg/mL sample with 400-nL injection
volume using a pH junction identified 288 ± 9 peptides and 121
± 5 proteins with the LTQ. There was outstanding concordance
in migration time between the pH junction and normal injection. The
pH junction produced narrower peaks and significant concentration
for all but the most acidic components in the sample. Compared with
the conventional stacking method, the pH junction method can generate
comparable performance for small injection volume (20 nL) and significantly
better concentration performance for a large injection volume (200
nL). We also applied the pH junction to three intact standard proteins
and observed a >10× increase in peak intensity compared to
conventional
injection.

==== Body
Capillary
zone electrophoresis
is an attractive alternative to reversed-phase liquid chromatography
for proteomics research. It provides fast and efficient separations
in a very simple flow path.1−3 However, application of capillary
zone electrophoresis to proteomics research has been discouraged by
a fundamental limitation of the technique. When the sample is prepared
in the same matrix as the running buffer, the injection volume must
be <1% of the capillary volume to minimize band broadening.4 In this conventional injection mode, the sample
volume is often less than 10 nL, which is 2 orders of magnitude smaller
than the injection volume commonly used in reversed-phase liquid chromatography.
This small injection volume results in poor concentration detection
limits and relatively small numbers of protein and peptide identifications.

A number of large injection volume methods have been developed
for capillary zone electrophoresis, such as solid-phase microextraction,
transient capillary isotachoporesis, and field enhanced sample injection.5−9 The dynamic pH junction is a particularly intriguing example of
a sample preconcentration technique that facilitates use of large
injection volumes.10−16 In one mode of the pH junction, amphoteric analyte is prepared in
a basic buffer and is negatively charged. The sample is injected by
pressure into a capillary filled with an acidic buffer. Application
of an electric field will cause the negatively charged analyte to
migrate toward the positive electrode at the injection end of the
capillary. Analyte is neutralized and is focused to a narrow band
when it reaches the acidic separation buffer at the front of the sample
plug. Focusing continues until the separation buffer has neutralized
the sample buffer. Very large sample volumes can be used with little
loss of separation efficiency. Alternatively, the sample can be prepared
in an acidic buffer and separated in a basic buffer.

Although
the dynamic pH junction technique has a long history,
to our knowledge, there have been no reports that employ this technique
for bottom-up proteomics analysis. In this manuscript, we coupled
the pH junction with capillary zone electrophoresis-tandem mass spectrometry
(CZE-MS/MS) for analysis of a tryptic digest of both a standard protein
and of the E. coli proteome. We also present preliminary
results for the concentration of intact standard proteins, mimicking
a top-down analysis.

Materials and Method
Reagents
Bovine
pancreas TPCK-treated trypsin, bovine
serum albumin (BSA), cytochrome C (Cyto.c), myoglobin (Myo), beta
casein, urea, ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3),
ammonium acetate (NH4C2H3O2), dithiothreitol (DTT), and iodoacetamide (IAA) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Acetonitrile (ACN) and formic acid
(FA) were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Methanol
was purchased from Honeywell Burdick & Jackson (Wicklow, Ireland).
Water was deionized by a NanoPure system from Thermo Scientific (Marietta,
OH). LPA-coated fused capillary (50 μm i.d./150 μm o.d.)
were purchased from Polymicro Technologies (Phoenix, AZ). Complete,
mini protease inhibitor cocktail (provided in EASYpacks) was purchased
from Roche (Indianapolis, IN).

Preparation of Sample
A 0.5 mg/mL solution of BSA in
100 mM NH4HCO3 (pH 8.0) containing 8 M urea
was denatured at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by standard reduction
and alkylation with DTT and IAA. Digestion was performed for 12 h
at 37 °C with trypsin at a trypsin/protein ratio of 1/30 (w/w).

The E. coli digests were prepared as reported
previously.17 Briefly, after cell culture
and cell lysis, 900 μg of E. coli homogenate
was purified by acetone precipitation and then dried at room temperature.
The dried sample was dissolved in 300 μL of 100 mM NH4HCO3 (pH 8.5) containing 8 M urea. After denatured at
37 °C for 60 min, the proteins were reduced by 8 mM of DTT (final
concentration) at 60 °C for 1 h and alkylated by 20 mM of IAA
(final concentration) at room temperature for 30 min in the dark,
followed by dilution to 1.5 mL with 100 mM NH4HCO3 (pH 8.5) to reduce the urea concentration less than 2 M. An aliquot
of 120 μg of treated proteins was digested by trypsin at a trypsin/protein
ratio of 1/30 (w/w) for 4 h at 37 °C.

After trypsin digestion,
the BSA and E. coli digests
were acidified by FA (0.5% (v/v) final concentration) to terminate
the reaction. Then the digests were desalted with a tC18 SepPak column
(Waters, Milford, MA), followed by lyophilization with a vacuum concentrator
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Marietta, OH). The dried samples were stored
at −20 °C before use.

Two mixtures of standard proteins
containing cytochrome c (0.1
mg/mL), myoglobin (0.1 mg/mL), and beta casein (0.5 mg/mL) dissolved
in 0.1% (v/v) FA buffer and 10 mM ammonium acetate (pH ∼6.5)
buffer were prepared for conventional and dynamic pH junction based
CZE-MS/MS analysis.

CZE-ESI-MS/MS Analysis
The CZE-ESI-MS/MS
system was
similar to that reported previously.17−21 High voltages were supplied by two Spellman CZE 1000R
power supplies. The LPA-coated separation capillary (60 cm, 50 μm
i.d./150 μm o.d.) was coupled to an LTQ XL instrument (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) with an electrokinetically pumped sheath-flow nanospray
interface.18 The emitter was pulled with
a Sutter pipet puller to ∼10 μm i.d. Voltage programming
was controlled by LabView software. For separation, 300 V/cm was applied
for BSA digests and E. coli digests analysis, and
400 V/cm was applied for intact protein analysis. Electrospray was
produced at 1.2 kV. Sample injection was performed by pressure. The
separation buffer for CZE is 0.1% (v/v) FA, and the electrospray sheath
liquid is 10% (v/v) methanol and 0.1% (v/v) FA.

For conventional
injection, the sample is prepared in the 0.1% FA separation buffer.
For pH junction injection, the sample is prepared in a 10 mM ammonium
acetate (pH ∼6.5) solution. For conventional stacking injection,
the sample is prepared in 50% (v/v) ACN with 0.05% (v/v) FA.

All experiments except the comparison of the pH junction with conventional
stacking were performed using an LTQ-XL mass spectrometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). For protein digests analysis with the LTQ, data
dependent acquisition was applied. Full MS scans were acquired over
the 395–1900 m/z range. The
10 most intense peaks were selected for fragmentation in the ion trap
with normalized collision energy of 35%, activation q = 0.25, activation time of 30 ms, and one microscan. Peaks selected
for fragmentation more than once within 45 s were excluded from selection
for 60 s. For intact protein analysis, no tandem spectra were acquired,
and full MS scans were acquired over the 600–2000 m/z range. Two microscans were applied.

A comparison
of the pH junction and conventional stacking was performed
on an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Full MS scans were acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer over the m/z 395–1800 range with resolution
of 30 000 (at 400 m/z). The
10 most intense peaks with a charge state ≥2 were fragmented
in the higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) collision cell
and analyzed by the Orbitrap mass analyzer with a resolution of 7 500.
One microscan was used. Normalized collision energy was set at 40%.
For MS and MS/MS spectra acquisition, the maximum ion inject time
was set as 500 and 250 ms, respectively. The precursor isolation width
was 2 Da. The target values for MS and MS/MS were set at 1.00 ×
106 and 5.00 × 104, respectively. Dynamic
exclusion was applied for the experiments. Peaks selected for fragmentation
more than once within 25 s were excluded from selection for 25 s.

Data Analysis
Database searching of acquired raw files
was performed in Proteome Discoverer 1.3 with the Mascot search engine
(version 2.2) against ipi.bovin.v3.68.fasta (for BSA) and the NCBI E. coli DH1 database (for E. coli). Database
searching of the reversed database was also performed in order to
evaluate the false discovery rate. The database searching parameters
included full tryptic digestion and allowed up to two missed cleavages,
precursor mass tolerance 2 Da, and fragment mass tolerance 1 Da. Carbamidomethylation
(C) was set as fixed modifications. Oxidation (M) was set as variable
modification.

Percolator software (version 1.17) integrated
in Proteome Discoverer 1.3 was used to evaluate the database search
results. Peptide confidence value as high was used to filter the peptide
identifications, and the corresponding false discovery rate at the
peptide level was less than 1%. On the protein level, the protein
grouping was enabled.

Data were imported into Matlab. Selected
ion electropherograms
were generated with a 10 ppm mass window. An unsupervised least-squares
routine (“fit”) was used to fit a Gaussian function
to selected ion electropherograms. The peak area was estimated as
the product of peak amplitude and width.

Results and Discussion
Most publications describing the pH junction have used uncoated
capillaries10,11,13−16 and a high concentration separation buffer (i.e., 1 M formic acid)
to minimize analyte adsorption onto the inner wall of capillary and
to reduce the electroosmotic flow for high-resolution separation.
In contrast, we used a linear polyacrylamide coated capillary to eliminate
electroosmotic flow and 0.1% formic acid as the separation buffer.
For conventional injection, the sample was prepared in 0.1% (v/v)
FA, which was also used for the separation. To generate the pH junction,
the sample was prepared in 10 mM ammonium acetate (pH ∼6.5).

Evaluation
of the Performance of Dynamic pH Junction for BSA
Digest Preconcentration
We first evaluated the dynamic pH
junction with a BSA tryptic digest, Figure 1. Conventional injection of a 20 nL sample volume produced a separation
window from 10 to 25 min (Figure 1A). We then
performed a dynamic pH junction injection of a 0.05 mg/mL BSA digest
prepared in 10 mM ammonium acetate (pH ∼6.5). Injection volumes
from 40 to 600 nL were used, Figure 1B–F.
Larger injection volumes resulted in a modest compression of the separation
window and an apparent loss of later migrating components. Nevertheless,
good electrophoretic profiles were obtained, even with an injection
volume of 600 nL, which is half the capillary volume. A plot of injection
volume vs normalization level (NL) was linear up to about 250 nL and
then began to saturate, S-Figure 1 in the Supporting
Information. Injection of 260 nL of the dilute 0.05 mg/mL BSA
digest (Figure 1D) generated a base peak intensity
that was comparable to the intensity produced by conventional injection
of 20 nL of 1 mg/mL BSA digests (Figure 1A).

FA (A); dynamic pH junction based experiments with 0.05 mg/mL BSA
digest in 10 mM ammonium acetate (pH ∼6.5) as sample. Injection
volumes and sample amounts were 40 nL and 2 ng (B), 130 nL and 6.5
ng (C), 260 nL and 13 ng (D), 400 nL and 20 ng (E), and 600 nL and
30 ng (F). NL: normalized level, which is the intensity of the most
intense peak.

We also generated extracted
ion electropherograms of three BSA
peptides from conventional injection and using the dynamic pH junction,
S-Figure 2–4 in the Supporting Information. The peptide intensity from the dynamic pH junction with injection
of 260 nL of 0.05 mg/mL BSA digests is comparable to that from conventional
injection of 20 nL of 1 mg/mL BSA digest with superior separation
efficiency. Significant enrichment was obtained for the three peptides
that have dramatically different isoelectric points (pI 4.5, 6, and
10), which demonstrates that this technique does not have strong bias
for either acidic or basic peptides.

We obtained 66% sequence
coverage and identified 37 peptides with
conventional injection of 20 nL of 1 mg/mL BSA digests. We obtained
70% coverage and identified over 40 peptides using the pH junction
with 130 nL or larger injection volume of the 0.05 mg/mL BSA digest.
The ion score from the Mascot database search was also analyzed, S-Figure
5 in the Supporting Information. Use of
the pH junction to inject a 130 nL or larger volume of 0.05 mg/mL
BSA digest generated mean and medium ion scores that are comparable
with those from conventional injection of 20 nL of a 1 mg/mL BSA digest.

Application of the Dynamic pH Junction Preconcentration Based
CZE-MS/MS for E. coli Digests Analysis
We
compared conventional and dynamic pH junction injections for bottom-up
analysis of E. coli digests, Figure 2. For conventional injection, 1 and 0.1 mg/mL E. coli digest samples were prepared in 0.1% (v/v) FA; 20 nL injection volumes
were analyzed by the CZE-MS/MS system, Figure 2A,B. As expected, the base peak intensity (normalized level, NL)
of the 0.1 mg/mL sample is about 1 order of magnitude lower than that
of the 1 mg/mL sample.

(D) E. coli digests in 10 mM ammonium acetate (pH

For the pH junction, 0.1 and 0.01
mg/mL E. coli digests were prepared in 10 mM ammonium
acetate (pH ∼6.5);
400 nL injection volumes (1/3 of the capillary
volume) were analyzed by the CZE-MS/MS system (Figure 2C,D). As with the BSA digest, the base peak intensity generated
by the dynamic pH junction is about 20 times higher than that of the
same sample concentration with conventional injection and the pH junction
generated a slightly narrower separation window. Also as with the
BSA results, the use of a 400-nL pH junction injection generated more
efficient peaks compared to a 20-nL conventional injection, S-Figure
6 in the Supporting Information.

We also analyzed the database search results from conventional
and pH junction injection of the E. coli samples.
Conventional injection of a 1 mg/mL sample identified 508 peptides
and 199 proteins. Dynamic pH junction of a 0.1 mg/mL sample identified
527 peptides and 179 proteins. These single-shot peptide and protein
identifications are much smaller than our earlier work, which employed
the much more powerful LTQ-Orbitrap Velos or Q-Exactive mass spectrometers.17,22

The pH junction was not quite as successful when applied to
a very
dilute E. coli digest. Conventional injection of
a 0.1 mg/mL sample yielded 366 peptides and 153 proteins. We performed
triplicate analysis of 0.01 mg/mL E. coli digest
sample with the dynamic pH junction method (injection volume, 400
nL; injection mass, 4 ng), Figure 3. Reasonably
reproducible separations were obtained, and the relative standard
deviation (RSD) of base peak intensity was about 15%. Because the
pH junction employs different sample matrix and running buffers with
a long injection length, the capillary needs to be flushed thoroughly
with running buffer between runs to obtain highly reproducible separations.

coli digests in 10 mM ammonium acetate (pH ∼6.5) analyzed
by dynamic pH junction based CZE-ESI-MS/MS in triplicate runs. The
injection volume for each run was 400 nL (20 cm injection length,
which occupies 1/3 of the capillary volume),
corresponding to injection of 4 ng of E. coli digest.
NL, normalized level.

The pH junction identified 288 ± 9 peptides and 121
±
5 proteins from this dilute sample, which represents a 20% decrease
in the number of identifications compared to conventional injection
of the 10× more concentrated sample.

Comparison of Dynamic pH
Junction and Conventional Stacking
There are several online
preconcentration methods for CE, including
conventional stacking, transient isotachophoresis, solid phase extraction,
and dynamic pH junction. Of these methods, the pH junction and conventional
stacking are the simplest. They require no change in instrument setup,
capillary preparation, and CE operation. The only change is using
different sample matrix. The pH junction uses a high pH sample buffer
while stacking uses a low ionic strength sample buffer.

We compared
the preconcentration performance of the dynamic pH junction with the
conventional stacking method using a 0.1 mg/mL E. coli digests sample.17 In this experiment,
the LTQ Orbitrap Velos was used for peptide identification, S-Figure
7 in the Supporting Information.

For a 1 cm injection length (20 nL, 2 ng sample amount), both pH
junction and stacking generate a ∼2-fold increase in base peak
signal compared with normal injection using the same injection length.
The number of peptide and protein identifications is comparable for
the two methods. Large volume stacking identified 140 proteins and
456 peptides. The pH junction identified 132 proteins and 598 peptides
in duplicate runs.

In contrast, the pH junction produced superior
results for a larger
injection volume. A 10 cm (200 nL, 20 ng) stacking injection identified
only 89 proteins and 363 peptides. In contrast, the pH junction with
a 10 cm injection length resulted in identification of 185 proteins
and 828 peptides, which is comparable with the data from our previous
work.17 However, the E. coli digest concentration used in this work is 10 times lower than the
previous work (0.1 mg/mL vs 1 mg/mL).

The results clearly demonstrate
that the pH junction is valuable
and efficient for low concentration complex proteome digest analysis,
which is critically important when only trace amounts of samples are
available. In addition, CZE usually has good mass detection limit
and worse concentration detection limit due to small sample injection
volume. Here, we generated enough bottom-up proteomic data to support
that the pH junction method is a simple and efficient method to significantly
improve the concentration detection limit of CZE for proteomic samples.

Injection Bias of Dynamic pH Junction
We compared the
performance of the pH junction and normal injection using a 1 cm injection
(20 nL) of a 0.1 mg/mL E. coli digest, Figure 4. Although the injection amounts were the same (2
ng) for both experiments, the pH junction generated more intense base
peak electropherograms. We then identified 307 peptides that generated
reasonably intense (>1 × 105) peaks in both the
normal
and pH junction data sets. Unsupervised nonlinear least-squares regression
was used to fit a Gaussian function to each of the peaks.

Figure 4 Base peak electropherograms
for a 20 nL (1 cm) injection of a 0.1
mg/mL E. coli tryptic digest. The electropherogram
generated with a pH junction injection is shown in blue (top), and
the electropherogram generated using normal injection is inverted
and shown in green (bottom).

The pH junction had little effect on either migration time
or peak
area. The peptide migration times for the two injection methods was
strongly correlated (slope = 1.1 ± 0.2, r =
0.94), S-Figure 8 in the Supporting Information. A plot of the peak area for the pH junction and normal injection
was also linear with a slope very near 1 (slope = 0.93 ± 0.03, r = 0.90), S-Figure 9 in the Supporting
Information.

The pH junction resulted in a significant
decrease in peak width
for all but the latest migrating components, Figure 5. The focusing effect was most pronounced for components with
a migration time between 12.5 and 20 min. Components with longer migration
time, which tend to be strongly acidic, generated wider peaks than
the normal injection. As a result, components with migration time
longer than ∼20 min have lower amplitude in the pH junction
experiment. These components are sufficiently acidic to require higher
pH sample buffer to undergo pH junction focusing.

Figure 5 Peak width, defined as
the standard deviation of the Gaussian function
used to fit the electrophoretic peak, is plotted versus migration
time for a 20 nL injection of a 0.1 mg/mL E. coli tryptic digest.

Dynamic pH Junction Preconcentration
Based CZE-MS System for
Intact Protein Concentration, Separation, and Detection
We
finally applied the dynamic pH junction based CZE-ESI-MS system for
separation of intact proteins, Figure 6. Three
standard proteins (cytochrome c, myoglobin, and beta casein) with
a pI from 5 to 10 were chosen as the sample. When
the sample was dissolved in 0.1% (v/v) FA for conventional injection
(20 nL), after CZE-MS analysis, cytochrome c and beta casein peaks
were observed, but no significant myoglobin peak was produced, Figure 6A. When the sample with same protein concentration
was dissolved in 10 mM ammonium acetate (pH ∼6.5) and 20 nL
of the sample was injected for dynamic pH junction based CZE-MS analysis,
the intensity of peaks corresponding to cytochrome c and casein was
3 times higher than that from conventional injection, and the peak
of myoglobin is dramatically increased in amplitude, Figure 6B. When 40 nL of protein sample in 10 mM ammonium
acetate (pH ∼6.5) was injected for analysis, the protein intensity
was around 1 order of magnitude higher than the conventional injection,
Figure 6C. These results suggest that the dynamic
pH junction based CZE-MS system may be of value in top-down proteomic
analysis.

using an LTQ mass spectrometer. A protein mixture containing cytochrome
C (Cyto.c, 0.1 mg/mL), myoglobin (Myo, 0.1 mg/mL), and beta casein
(0.5 mg/mL) was used as the sample. The sample was dissolved in 0.1%
(v/v) FA for the normal CZE-MS experiment and in 10 mM ammonium acetate
(pH ∼6.5) for the dynamic pH junction experiments. NL, normalized
level.
