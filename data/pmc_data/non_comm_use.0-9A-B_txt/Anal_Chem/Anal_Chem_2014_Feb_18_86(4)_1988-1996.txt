Rapid
screening and diagnosis of tuberculosis disease (TB) is still
challenging and critically needed for global TB control efforts. In
this study, we present a rapid and streamlined technology, using precisely
engineered silica nanopore thin films, which are optimized for pore
size, structure, capillary force, and film thickness, to isolate Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) antigens in laboratory
and clinical samples for rapid TB screening. This technology, referred
to here as on-chip fractionation, is integrated with high-throughput
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of flight mass spectrometry
to screen and identify fragments of the MTB antigen, CFP-10, from
complex biological samples, without use of immunoaffinity agents.
With the use of this comprehensive approach, we were able to clearly
distinguish a clinical isolate of MTB from a nonTB species of the
genus Mycobacterium avium grown in
liquid culture media. This assay can reach a detection limit of 10
fmol and an isolation rate of 90% for the antigen CFP-10. Our strategy
has significant potential to fill the conceptual and technical gaps
in rapid diagnosis of active TB disease.

==== Body
Annual worldwide statistics
indicate nine million new cases and 1.5 million deaths from tuberculosis
(TB), an airborne infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (MTB), establishing TB as a continued
significant public health challenge.1 A
major contributing factor against global TB control has been unfavorably
influenced by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic and
the emergence of tenacious multidrug and extensively drug-resistant
TB (M/XDR-TB). To minimize the morbidity and mortality associated
with this infectious disease, a rapid and reliable diagnostic and
screening test for active TB is needed for early identification and
prevention. Current screening methods, including the tuberculin skin
test (TST) and interferon gamma releasing assay (IGRAs), suffer from
either low sensitivity/specificity or high costs, and importantly,
cannot distinguish active TB disease from remote latent TB infection.
Addressing specificity, the latest PCR-based GeneXpert test provides
relatively increased sensitivity and specificity for TB disease, but
it is unable to detect some types of active TB disease (i.e., tuberculous
meningitis and other extrapulmonary TB) without invasive procedures
(i.e., lumber puncture).2 The MTB culture
test (MTCT) remains the standard laboratory diagnosis of active TB
disease and identification of drug-resistance strains but requires
10–40 days of turnaround time.3

All attenuated strains of Mycobacterium bovis used for TB vaccination (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, BCG) and
a majority of nonTB mycobacterial species, analyzed to date, lack
the CFP-10 (culture filtrate antigen 10 kDa), one of several potent
T cell antigens secreted by MTB.4 The detection
of CFP-10 in culture supernatants can be used to distinguish MTB from
most other mycobacteria.5 Therefore, we
advocate an efficient and accurate strategy for the direct identification
of CFP-10 in specimens taken from susceptible patient cohorts in order
to screen and monitor treatment of active TB disease.6−8

Specific antigen detection methods (immunogenicity) have relied
heavily on the use of antibodies, a high-cost commodity. Several commercial
CFP-10 antibodies are available for homemade indirect enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), but high sensitive sandwich ELISA is
still not commercially available. In addition to immunoassays, matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization time-of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS)
has increasingly become a workhorse for profiling analytes in biological
samples due to its high degree of molecular mass specificity and sensitivity
and its ability to provide peptide sequence information.9−12 Although powerful, MALDI-TOF-MS nevertheless requires sample pretreatment
to generate high-quality proteomic profiles, particularly for low
abundance proteins/peptides or other analytes, in which MS spectra
are overshadowed by more abundant/high-molecular weight (HMW) species.
An efficient sample fractionation pathway, therefore, is required
for identifying and quantifying low-molecular weight (LMW)/low-abundant
CFP-10 from a complex biological sample with MALDI-TOF-MS.

In
consideration of all of the above, conceptual and technical
obstacles posed by current methods for screening and monitoring TB
disease, we explored designs for a robust, antibody-free platform,
combining the use of tailorable nanoporous materials (to capture CFP-10
from TB cultures) with MALDI-TOF-MS. The superior properties of nanoporous
silica have been demonstrated in various applications, including chemical
sensing, filtration, catalysis, and drug-delivery.13−16 Tweaking the architectural, physical,
and chemical properties of the materials, by adjusting the processing
parameters in evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA), imparts functionality
to these applications. We and others have developed a number of nanoporous
materials that exhibit different characteristics (e.g., geometry,
size, affinity, etc.) for sequestering the LMW proteins/peptides present
in circulation in order to discover the signatures of disease, such
as pulmonary metastatic melanoma and breast cancer.16−19 The results reported here, distinctive
to those previous studies, demonstrate our ability to capture and
identify specific LMW and low abundant TB disease markers, through
a comprehensive approach that incorporates precisely designed silica
nanopore (NPS or “nanotrap”) thin films with MALDI-TOF-MS,
with a remarkably low detection threshold and high isolation rate.

Results
Nanopore-Based
Assay to Map the CFP-10 Peptidic “Fingerprints”
An overview of our technology platform is illustrated in Figure 1a. Biological samples, in this case TB or nonTB
liquid culture filtrates, were applied to a gasket silicone culture
well (3 mm diameter and 1 mm height) array that was placed on top
of the NPS film. As described in Materials and Methods, 200 samples can be processed on a 4 in. silicon wafer coated with
a nanoporous film. The relatively small size of proteins/peptides
such as CFP-10 can be trapped by the silica nanopores. Large proteins
cannot enter the nanometer-sized pores and were eliminated by washing.
Conducted on fixed silica films, sample capture and washing during
on-chip fractionation eliminates the need for tedious and error-prone
sedimentation required by particle-based systems. The fabrication
of nanoporous film on a 4 in. wafer costs ∼$20. A single wafer
can hold 200 samples; hence, the cost of each single test is only
$0.1. To generate smaller peptides necessary for achieving high signal-to-noise
ratio and resolution in MALDI-TOF-MS, we performed on-chip enzymatic
digestion with trypsin prior to establishing a “fingerprint”
of recombinant CFP-10 (Figure 1b and Figure
S1 of the Supporting Information). This
on-chip digestion allows trypsin to be transported into nanopores
and catalyze the targeted peptides inside nanopores. The nanopore-based
enzymatic digestion has been reported for higher digestion efficiency
and better stability of digested peptides.20−22 In addition,
the on-chip digestion process eliminates error-prone processes, including
buffer exchange and protein extraction required by solution-based
digestions. After only 8 h of incubation, we then added an elution
buffer to extract the digested proteins/peptides retained inside the
“nanotrap”.

and sequence identification of the major CFP-10 fragments observed

The utility of NPS is
demonstrated in Figure S2 of the Supporting Information. With fractionation, the
enriched major CFP-10 signals became more evident in the mass spectrum.
The MS spectra of recombinant CFP-10 mapped strong signals for four
major fragments (Figure 1, panels b and c,
and Figure S2 of the Supporting Information), with the two highest signals observed at [M + H]+ 1142.63
and 1593.75 ([M+H]+: protonated molecule) and the other
fragments also displayed significant peaks in MS spectra (Figure 2b). We confirmed by liquid chromatography tandem
mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) that these fragments originated
from CFP-10 (Figure S3 of the Supporting Information). Although these fragments were the part of the trypsin-digested
products of CFP-10, we selected the fragments with strong signals
in the MS fingerprint as promising signatures of CFP-10 ([M + H]+ 1142.63, 1317.66, 1593.75, and 2003.98).

Figure 2 (a) BET and ellipsometry
were used to measure film characteristics
and dimensions. The porosity and film thickness were measured by ellipsometry.
The surface area, pore volume, and pore size were determined by N2 adsorption/desorption analysis. The details of nanopore characterization
were described in Materials and Methods. The
L121 + 25% PPG (thin) is expected to have the same pore morphology
as the standard L121 + 25% PPG. (b) The proportion of unfragmented
CFP-10 that was retained in the detection well after washing (40 ng

ng. (c) MALDI-MS signal intensity of each CFP-10 fragment normalized

and digestion prior to MS analysis (mean ± s.d.; n = 5). (d) Measuring the amount of CFP-10 fragments recovered from
sample input. Recombinant CFP-10 (40 ng) was spiked into the culture
medium, which was then treated with on-chip fractionation and digestion.
The absolute amounts of CFP-10 fragments ([M+H]+ 1142.63
and 1593.75) were quantified by spiking isotopic fragments into eluted
samples.

Adapting Nanopore Morphology
Influences CFP-10 Enrichment
Different design parameters
(e.g., pore size and shape, chemistry,
porosity, etc.) dictate the “landscape” and ultimately
the peptidic fingerprint of samples processed by on-chip fractionation.
To determine the optimal morphology for CFP-10 isolation, we adjusted
the pore morphology by using different copolymers and the swelling
agent, polypropylene glycol (PPG), which interacts with the hydrophobic
domain of polymers to expand the micelle template during NPS film
fabrications.16,23 Mixing various compositions of
the pluronic triblock copolymers F127, L64, and L121 mixed with PPG
at 0, 25, 50, and 100% weight of the copolymers yielded various numbers
of film thickness, porosity, surface area, and pore volume and sizes
(Figure 2a).

We first investigated the
isolation efficiency of recombinant CFP-10 as a function of these
NPS configurations. As described in Materials and
Methods, 0.05 mg/mL of CFP-10 dissolved in the PBS buffer were
incubated in the silicon gasket well (3 mm diameter) placed on the
NPS surface. After extensive washes, the amount of CFP-10 remaining
in the wash solution was quantified by a homemade indirect ELISA,
and the percentages of CFP-10 retained in the morphologically distinct
nanopores are reported in Figure 2b. We observed
significantly lower isolation efficiency when the highly ordered nanoporous
film (F127) for fractionation was compared to the use of nonordered
nanoporous films (L121), although the average nanopore sizes of both
films are comparable (pore size of F127: 3.7 nm vs L121: 3.9 nm).
We have previously shown the F127 film consists of 2-dimensional (2D)
hexagonal and closely packed nanopores that are perpendicular to the
film’s surface.16 In contrast, L121
or L121 + PPG films are composed of nonordered or wormlike nanoporous
structures.16 Our result suggests the nonordered
nanopore structure is more conducive to isolating CFP-10.

Pore
size also strongly influences the fractionation efficiency.
Among the nonordered nanoporous films, the L64 film with 3.2 nm average
nanopore diameter displays lower isolation efficiency than other films
(L121 and L121 + PPG). Moreover, the films consisting of nanopore
size above 3.9 nm show similar CFP-10 isolation efficiencies irrespective
of the addition of PPG (L121 and L121 + PPG). This result suggests
that the rodlike CFP-10 with dimensions of 1.5 × 6 nm was not
significantly excluded by nanopores larger than 3.9 nm.24

Modifying the nanopore film thickness,
without interfering with
pore morphology also influences the efficiency of sample peptide retention
and enrichment. The thickness can be manipulated by diluting the coating
sol, which is the silicate sol mixed with polymer (see Materials and Methods) in ethanol or controlling the spin
speed of the spin coater. We synthesized L121 + 25% PPG films of two
varieties, the 643 nm thick version and the 196 nm thin version, and
observed that the thick film captured more CFP-10 peptides (Figure 2b). To further understand this phenomenon, we measured
the amount of CFP-10 penetrating into the nanoporous film, using X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As presented in Figure S4 of the Supporting Information, the concentration of
CFP-10 declined exponentially as a function of nanoporous film thickness,
but the majority of peptide accumulated within the top 100 nm layer.
Because the diameter of the nanopore we used here is similar in size
to the low molecular weight proteins, the adsorption of proteins inside
the nanopore will cause a kinetic trap and minimize the diffusion
caused by concentration gradients. We reasoned that thicker films
(643 nm vs 196 nm) provide additional reservoirs needed for the capillary-guided
water flow. The capillary filling action enhanced the transportation
of CFP-10 within nanopores. Of all the nanopore configurations tested,
the one structure resulting in an isolation efficiency up to 90% (36
ng of CFP-10) exhibited the following parameters: L121 + 25% PPG,
632 nm thickness, 7 mm2 surface area, and a 30 minute incubation
(Figure 2b).

Adjusting the concentration
of PPG not only affects pore size but
also changes the structure’s porosity, defined as the fraction
of void spaces in the film. In Figure 2b, we
observed comparable CFP-10 isolation efficiencies when the L121 and
L121 + PPG films were used. However, we also considered other parameters
that could singly or collectively improve the peptide enrichment and
detection procedure, including the likely exclusion of abundant protein
species in the sample, the efficiency of trypsin digestion, and sample
elution. To test our hypothesis, we spiked recombinant CFP-10 into
sterile MTB culture media, processed the samples on nanopore films
of distinct characteristics and detected through MS, and then compared
the MS signals of CFP-10 fragments (Figure 2c). To minimize the variation caused by the intrinsic fluctuations
of MALDI MS,25,26 each extracted sample was spiked
with isotopic peptides in known quantities to serve as internal standards.
These isotopic peptides were synthesized by digested CFP-10 in 18O-enriched water (H218O), leading to
their shift in mass by 4 Da without changing any other physical properties.
Each MS signal shown in Figure 2c was normalized
by its own isotopic fragments. Although adjusting the pore size and
porosity of L121 with PPG did not alter the amount of isolated CFP-10
(Figure 2b), its impact became much more evident
when we examined the MS data (Figure 2c). Addition
of PPG did have a positive effect on the detection of CFP-10 fragments,
with the highest MS signals observed when the sample was processed
on the L121 + 25% PPG nanoporous film. This increase tapers down and
plateaus with the further addition of PPG (100%). One possible reason
for these observations is that the small pore size of L121 without
PPG (av pore size: 3.9 nm) hinders the diffusion of globulelike trypsin
(4 nm diameter),27 preventing interactions
between trypsin and CFP-10 retained inside the nanotraps. With pore
sizes beyond 5 nm, the effect of PPG on trypsin digestion is once
again minimal to none (compare L121 + 25% PPG and L121 + 50% PPG to
L121). Additionally, the larger pores retain more of the abundant
proteins present in the sample, leading to a MS signal reduction of
CFP-10 fragments. Indeed, we observed a significant decrease in MS
signal intensity when the L121 + 100% PPG film (av. pore size: 6.8
nm) was used.

Determining the Amount of CFP-10 from MTB
Cultures
To quantify the absolute amount of CFP-10 fragments
by their isotopic
fragments, we first established a standard curve of the signal ratio
of each monoisotopic and 18O-labeled fragment (Figure S6
of the Supporting Information). The isotopic
fragments shifted by 4 Da to partially overlap with the monoisotopic
fragments. The fragments with [M + H]+ 1142.63 and 1593.75
in MALDI-TOF-MS showed good linear regression between MS signal intensity
and fragment quantity below 400 nM (Figure S4 of the Supporting Information, R2 = 1.00
and 0.98, respectively), whereas the fragments of [M + H]+ 1317.66 and 2003.98 demonstrated poor linear regression (R2 = 0.86 and 0.50, respectively). On the basis
of standard curves for the fragments with [M + H]+ 1142.63
and 1593.75, we quantified the amount of CFP-10 after on-chip sample
processing on different nanopore films. Similar to our earlier results,
CFP-10 processed on L121 + 25% PPG resulted in the highest yield at
1.2 pmol (Figure 2d).

To test the sensitivity
of our assay and determine its minimum threshold of detection, we
titrated recombinant CFP-10 in sterile MTB culture media and processed
each sample on the L121 + 25% PPG film and through MS. The MS signals
of 4 major fragments, each normalized to its own isotope, are depicted
in Figure 3a, plotted as signal intensity versus
CFP-10 concentration in the log–log plot. Linear regression
ranged from acceptable to good. On the basis of these results, we
determined that this assay can detect CFP-10 in culture media at a
remarkably low concentration of 14.1 nM. We improved the limit of
detection to 1.4 nM by concentrating CFP-10 10-fold by ammonium sulfate
precipitation of the culture media (as described in Materials and Methods) before on-chip processing (Figure 3b).

was normalized by its own isotope as an internal standard. (a) Unprecipitated
culture medium for each CFP-10 dilution is processed through on-chip
fractionation and digestion. The sensitivity plot maintains good linear
regression above 14.1 nM in log–log scale. (b) The samples
are precipitated 10× by ammonium sulfate prior to on-chip processing.
MS analysis shows that the detection limit has been lowered to 1.4
nM, as a result of sample concentration.

To access the interday and intraday variability of our combined
on-chip fractionation-MS analysis, we spiked recombinant CFP-10 at
three different and defined concentrations, in replicate samples,
into sterile culture media. The fragments with [M+H]+ 1142.63
and 1593.75 displayed higher MS signals (Tables 1 & 2), better linear regression with respect
to their isotopes, and better quantification accuracy (% RE, relative
error) and precision (% coefficient of variation, CV) compared to
the fragments with [M + H]+ 1317.66 and 2003.98 (Tables
S1 and S2 of the Supporting Information). At 100 nM concentrations, the mean calculated concentrations remained
within 10% of the actual values (% RE) and did not exceed 30% of the
%CV. At lower concentrations (1.4 nM), the accuracy of quantification
decreased. The qualitative identification of CFP-10 remained very
precise even at only 1.4 nM. We detected strong MS signals for the
fragments with [M+H]+ 1142.63 and 1593.75 in all of the
samples (n = 11) and the fragments with [M+H]+ 1317.66 and 2003.98 in 63% and 72% of the samples.

Differentiating MTB Based
On Its CFP-10 Signatures in Clinical
Isolate
To address specificity of our on-chip fractionation-MS
technology, we investigated the expression of CFP-10 from MTB grown
in culture media (Figure 4). The nonTB Mycobacterium
(NTM), Mycobacterium avium lacks the
CFP-10 gene and therefore serves as our negative control. To mimic
conditions one may find in early disease diagnosis (i.e, low secretion
of CFP-10 in the culture supernatant), we performed the same ammonium
sulfate concentration protocol prior to on-chip fractionation-MS analysis.
Indeed, strong MS signals for all the fragments were observed in the
supernatant of the MTB cultures but not in the M. avium culture (Figure 4). These results were corroborated
by LC–MS/MS for the fragments of [M+H]+ 1142.63,
1317.66, and 1593.75 (Figure S7 of the Supporting
Information).

these fragments
were observed in the culture of nonTB species of mycobacteria (M. avium).

Discussion
Rapid screening and diagnosis of active
TB disease has been a long-standing
challenge in global TB control. Current diagnostic tests depend on
the actual detection of MTB by bacteriological methods such as AFB
smear microscopy and bacterial culture, or by molecular identification
of MTB DNA (e.g., PCR-based GeneXpert). Both types of methods require
the presence of MTB bacteria in the patient’s specimens (sputum,
etc.), often barring or rendering difficult disease detection for
pausibacillary TB (e.g., culture-negative TB and extrapulmonary TB).
For this study, we hypothesize that all active TB diseases, whether
paucibacillary or otherwise, involve the secretion of MTB antigens
(CFP10 and ESAT-6) into the host body and further into the circulatory
system. As such, we designed a platform that combines the specificity
and ease of our nanopore-based on-chip fractionation assay with the
powerful MS analysis in terms of sensitivity and specificity. By detecting
the patterns of these disease-specific antigens, one can potentially
provide a rapid screening method of active TB disease.

One of
the first tasks was to determine those design parameters
for the nanopore films that are most conducive to high enrichment/isolation
of peptides from low sample volumes. We previously established a fabrication
protocol to place a thin NPS film onto a flat silicon substrate constructed
with highly uniform and textured nanopores.16 The silica nanopore structures are constructed by the self-assembly
of structure-directing triblock copolymers consisting of a hydrophobic
(PPO) core capped by two hydrophilic (PEO) blocks. Under the cooperative
effects of capillary force and size-exclusion, LMW proteins and peptides
will diffuse into well-defined and nanometer-sized silica pores, whereas
the large and more abundant molecules remain excluded to be washed
away during chip processing. We often refer to this procedure as peptide
fractionation, isolation, and enrichment, which results in stronger
MS signals for LMW or low-abundance species. Here, we adapted this
versatile technology to the detection of active TB disease. To our
knowledge, this is the first demonstration that employs a convenient
and relatively inexpensive, antibody-free nanopore platform coupled
to benchtop MALDI-TOF-MS analysis, to isolate and quantify CFP-10
from MTB cultures with a low detection limit.

The detection
procedure consists of three major steps: (1) enriching
CFP-10 in the nanopore and removing abundant larger proteins; (2)
trypsin digesting the isolated CFP-10; and (3) extracting CFP-10 fragments
from the nanopore. During the isolation step, absorption of buffer
in nanoporous films via capillary action drives CFP-10 into the nanopore
of the film, a critical factor for peptide isolation efficiency. As
presented above (Figure 2b), using the thicker
films with highly interconnected nanopores and additional reservoirs
for flow resulted in enhanced peptide isolation.

As we have
demonstrated previously and elaborated further in this
work, several characteristics such as nanopore size, film architecture,
and peptide features (size, shape, charge, etc.) dictate the isolation
efficiency,28,29 thus imparting such versatility
to the varieties of peptides that can be captured and enriched on
this platform. In general, larger pores reduce the diffusion barrier
to allow more proteins/peptides into the defined space. On the other
hand, because of this capacity to pack into the porous film, abundant
proteins/peptides that meet the size-exclusion criteria will also
pack into the space and later overwhelm the signals of low-abundance
species in MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. In addition, pore size constrains
the diffusion of trypsin into the porous film and/or its interaction
with enzymatic substrates. Smaller pores (3.9 nm) limit the “wiggle-room”
for globular trypsin (4 nm diameter) to maneuver its catalyzing of
the rodlike CFP-10 (1.5 × 6 nm). After a comprehensive analysis
of nanopore morphology for optimal CFP-10 isolation and MALDI-TOF-MS
data quality, we concluded that the best configuration (i.e., L121
+ 25% PPG) should exhibit 5 nm, nonordered pores.

Using the
L121 + 25% PPG nanotrap, we demonstrated up to 90% isolation
of recombinant CFP-10 from a quantified solution. Significant amounts
of CFP-10 fragments were recovered from the biological samples (Figure 2d), suggesting that the efficiency of recovery may
be improved up to 3 times more, pending further nanopore optimization.
As the technology couples on-chip fractionation to MS, the sensitivity
of detection logically also relies on MALDI-TOF-MS parameters. The
titration curve of CFP-10 fragments shown in Figure S8 of the Supporting Information indicated the detection
limit of MALDI-TOF-MS, under current operating conditions, at 0.2
fmol (0.5 μL of a 0.4 nM solution containing CFP-10 spotted
on the target plate). Barring no interference from other mycobacteria
species in the samples, the detection limit of the current detection
protocol is on the order of 1 nM. Hence, in addition to nanopore optimization,
adjusting MALDI-TOF-MS parameters (e.g., matrix selection, sample
drying, tuning laser energy, etc.) and concentrating samples (e.g.,
ammonium sulfate precipitation) prior to on-chip fractionation are
fine-tuning strategies to further improve sample detection.30−32 Of the latter method, we successfully enhanced detection of CFP-10
by performing a 10-fold concentration procedure. Although this prefractionation
procedure simultaneously increased the amount of abundant, and potentially
interfering, proteins in the sample, its unintended consequence could
easily be minimized or even negated as a result of the on-chip fractionation
process through nanoporous films. Combining standard precipitation,
where needed, our on-chip fractionation platform remains a feasible
alternative and should be especially applicable in situations of extremely
low peptide abundance, such as the very early onset of disease.

CFP-10 is an ideal biomarker for MTB because of its absence from
the majority of nonTB mycobacteria (NTM). We clearly distinguished
the clinical isolate of MTB from M. avium, a NTM organism devoid of CFP-10 secretion. We envision its use
as a diagnostic tool, amenable to high-throughput application, to
screen patient specimens (e.g., serum, urine, pleural fluid, and cerebrospinal
fluids for tuberculous meningitis, etc.) for active TB disease quickly,
accurately, and with lead-time for effective treatment.

Materials and
Methods
Fabrication of Nanoporous Silica Thin Films
The silicate
sol was prepared by adding 14 mL of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS)
to a solution of 17 mL of ethanol, 6.5 mL of distilled water, and
0.5 mL of 6 M HCl and then stirred at 80 °C for 2 h to form a
clear solution. After the silicate sol cooled down to 25 °C,
the silicate sol was added to a mixture of pluronic polymer, ethanol,
and different amounts of polypropylene glycol (PPG, labeled as % wt
of L121). The recipes for the porous silica films are reported in
Table S3 of the Supporting Information.
The coating solution was stirred at 25 °C for 2 h. The coating
sol was deposited on a Si(100) wafer by spin coating at the spin rate
of 2500 rpm for 20 s. To increase the degree of polymerization of
the silica framework in the films and to further improve their thermal
stability, the deposited films were heated at 80 °C for 12 h.
The films were calcinated at 450 °C for 5 hrs to remove the organic
compound. The temperature was raised at a rate of 1 °C/min. Pluronic
polymers (L121, L64, and F127) were obtained from BASF. All other
chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Characterization of Nanoporous
Silica Thin Film
The
thickness and porosity of nanoporous silica films were characterized
by variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometer (J. A. Woollam Company
M-2000DI). The thickness of thin films and their porosities were calculated
in Cauchy and effective medium approximation (EMA) models using Complete
EASE software (Berlin, Germany, version 4.58). Ellipsometric optical
quantities were detected by acquiring spectra at incidence angles
of 55, 60, and 65° in wavelengths ranging from 300 to 1800 nm.
All fabricated porous silica thin films were characterized by scanning
over the entire 4 in. wafer using the ellipsometer. The variations
for porosity and thickness were less than 0.5%.

N2 adsorption/desorption analysis was applied in measuring surface
area and pore size distribution. Quantachrome Autosorb-3b BET Surface
Analyzer was used to record the N2 adsorption/desorption
isotherm at 77 K on the full range of relative P/P0 pressures. Nanopore size distributions were
calculated from the desorption branch of the isotherms using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) method.

On-Chip Fractionation and Digestion of Proteins/Peptides
To test the detection limit of CFP-10 in complex culture of MTB,
different amounts (0–1 μg/mL) of recombinant CFP-10 were
mixed in blank culture media (BBL MGIT, purchased Mycobacteria Growth
Indicator from BD). Recombinant CFP-10 was purchased from Diagnostics,
Inc. (Woburn, MA). Unless otherwise indicated, 8 μL of culture
sample was pipetted onto the silica nanoporous film and incubated
for 30 min in a humidified chamber at 25 °C. The superfluous
solution was then removed, and 10 μL of deionized water was
applied onto the silica porous film to remove larger proteins excluded
from the nanopores. The washing was then repeated 4 times. For on-chip
digestion, 10 μL of 5 μg/mL trypsin (dissolved in 100
mM sodium bicarbonate) was applied onto the silica nanoporous film
and incubated overnight at 37 °C. After complete digestion, the
nanoporous film was removed from the humidity chamber and allowed
to dry. Then, 10 μL of elution buffer [0.1% trifluoracetic acid
(TFA) + 50% acetonitrile (ACN) in water] was pipetted to extract the
CFP-10 fragments. The elution buffer containing fractionated and digested
peptides was then removed and stored in a microcentrifuge tube until
MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. In order to detect CFP-10 at extremely low
concentrations, the culture medium spiked with recombinant CFP-10
was treated with ammonium sulfate (466 μL of saturated ammonium
sulfate solution were mixed with 200 μL samples). The samples
were mixed and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, then centrifuged
at 10000g for 10 min to pellet the precipitated peptides.
Once dried, the peptide pellets were dissolved in 20 μL of double-deionized
water.

18O-Labeling of Trypsin-Catalyzed CFP-10 Fragments
The recombinant CFP-10 was dried and redissolved in 18O-enriched water (97%, Sigma-Aldrich). Trypsin solution (0.5 mg/mL
of trypsin and 100 mM of NH4HCO3) was also dissolved
in 18O-enriched water. The solution of CFP-10 and trypsin
(20:1 weight ratio) was incubated overnight at 37 °C to allow
complete digestion of CFP-10.

MALDI-TOF-MS Analysis
A matrix solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic
acid (CHCA, 4 g/L) was prepared in a mixture of ACN and water (1:1,
v/v) containing 0.1% TFA. Each sample was equally mixed with 18O-labeled CFP-10 solution (42 nM). First, 0.5 μL of
each CFP-10 mixture was spotted onto the MALDI target plate and allowed
to dry at 25 °C. Another 0.5 μL of the matrix solution
was spotted onto the dried CFP-10 samples and allowed to dry at 25
°C. Mass spectra were collected using the Applied Biosystems
4700 MALDI TOF/TOF Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The operating parameters:
positive reflection mode in the range of 800–5000 Da, 5000
laser shots, and laser intensity of 4300 instrument units. The spectra
were calibrated externally using a peptide calibration standard and
processed with Data Explorer (Applied Biosystems).

Quantification
of CFP-10 Processed through NPS
To examine
the isolation efficiency of CFP-10 on films of different nanopore
morphology and configuration, the amount of peptide remaining in the
wash buffer was measured using indirect ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay). Here, 8 μL of a 5 μg/mL solution containing CFP-10
(dissolved in 1× PBS) were applied in each well of the NPS, allowed
to incubate for 30 min, and then washed with 10 μL of 1×
PBS 5 times. The wash buffer was collected for protein quantification
using indirect ELISA. Mouse monoclonal antibody against CFP-10 was
purchased from Abcam, Inc. The indirect ELISA materials, including
96 well plate and TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine)
solution, were purchased from Thermo Scientific and eBioscience, respectively.
The peptides were incubated at 4 °C overnight to allow coating
on the 96 well plate, blocked with 5% serum in 1× PBS buffer,
and then probed sequentially with primary followed by secondary antibodies.
The chromogenic substrate TMB was used for signal detection.

XPS (X-ray
Photoelectron Spectroscopy) Depth Profiling
A 0.01 mg/mL
solution of CFP-10 (dissolved in 100 mM NaCl) were incubated
on L121 + 25% PPG nanoporous film, washed with deionized water, and
then incubated in a vacuum chamber overnight prior to XPS measurement.
The PHI Quantera XPS, equipped with an Ar+ ion gun was
used to construct the concentration depth profile, sputtering Ar+ ions at 3 kV onto the films within a 2 × 2 mm area.
The film thickness determined by an ellipsometer (J.A. Woollam Co,
Inc.) was used to calibrate the etching rate on porous silica by sputtering
until the oxygen (O1s) signal vanished. A sputtering time interval
of 9 s was used to reach a depth spacing of 5.25 nm at 35 nm/min of
Ar+ ion etching rate. Nitrogen (N1s) spectra were used
to identify the amount of CFP-10 trapped at different depths.

LC–MS/MS
Measurement
Two-hundred microliters
of MTB culture media were precipitated and processed by on-chip fractionation,
as described previously. To avoid remaining impurity, such as polymer
damaging the LC column, the processed solutions were further treated
with SCX zip-tip (Millipore) before being injected into LC–MS/MS
system. Reversed-phase chromatography was performed on Waters Xevo
TQ system (Waters corporation, Milford, MA). Gradient solvents used
for LC analysis are (A) 0.1% formic acid in water and (B) 0.1% formic
acid in acetonitrile. Samples were dried in a vacuum centrifuge prior
to injection into the LC and resuspended in 1% formic acid and 5 mM
NH4OAc. Database search using the PLGS search engine (Waters
corporation) was performed to identify the peptide peaks of interest.

Biosafety of MTB Culture
All bacteria cultures were
carried out by using BACTEC MGIT 960 system (Becton Dickinson, Sparks,
MD). After a 2-week culture, the MTB culture samples were filtered
by using a 0.2 μm size Whatman filter (Whatman plc, Kent, U.K.)
to remove the bacteria and the culture supernatant was sterilized
in a Biosafety level 3 (BL3) facility. To confirm the filtered culture,
supernatants were completely disinfected, a 10 μ-filtered sample,
s, was inoculated into Lowenstein-Jensen medium for 6-week culture,
and no bacterial colonies were found.
