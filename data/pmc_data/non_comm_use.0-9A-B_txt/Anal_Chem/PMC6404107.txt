A novel analytical
method based on hybrid trapped ion mobility
spectrometry-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TIMS-TOFMS) has been
developed to achieve fast enantiomeric separation of amino acids (AAs).
Resolution of chiral AAs was achieved by forming diastereomers through
derivatization with the chiral agent (+)-1-(9-fluorenyl)ethyl chloroformate
(FLEC), avoiding the use of reference compounds. Electrospray ionization
(ESI) in positive mode yielded sodiated FLEC-AAs ions of which the
diastereomers could be separated by TIMS. The effect of other alkali
metal ions (such as Li and K) on the enantioselectivity was studied,
but chiral discrimination was only observed for Na. TIMS conditions,
including voltage ramp, ramp time, and accumulation time were optimized
for each AA, and collision cross sections (CCSs) were determined for
all diastereomers. The migration order of the DL enantiomers was found
to be dependent on the structure of the AA. The resulting TIMS resolution
(K0/ΔK0) for the FLEC-AA diastereomers on average was 115, requiring
a mobility (K0) difference of about 0.009 cm2/(V s) to
achieve 50%-valley separation. From the 21 AAs studied, enantiomer
separation was achieved for 17 AAs with mobility differences ranging
from 0.009 for lysine up to 0.061 cm2/(V s) for asparagine.
Moreover, the presented methodology provided mutual separation of
various AAs, allowing chiral analysis of multiple AAs simultaneously
which may be challenging with previous enantioselective IMS approaches.
It appeared possible to fully resolve all studied DL-AAs using three
distinct TIMS methods, resulting in a total MS run time of about 3
min (1 min per method) and a total analysis time (including derivatization)
of less than 15 min. The method demonstrated capable to determine
enantiomeric ratios down to 2.5% with detection limits for the D enantiomers
in the nanomolar range. This new TIMS-based methodology opens up possibilities
for easy and fast analysis of AA enantiomers.

==== Body
The intrinsic
chiral environment
of living systems makes enantiomers of a chiral compound often show
mutually different chemical behavior or biological activity. In fact,
when interacting with enzymes, proteins, or receptors, the enantiomeric
configuration of the molecule is critical and changes may result in
modulated biological function.1 Molecular
chirality clearly plays an essential role in biological, medical,
pharmaceutical, and food sciences, generating a strong requirement
for enantioselective analytical methods.

Amino acids (AAs) are
an important class of chiral molecules which
constitute the building blocks of proteins and are key molecules in
maintaining the physiology of the organism.2 Along with the 20 proteinogenic AAs, there are hundreds of AAs of
nonprotein origin, which also have different key functions.3,4 Most AAs are chiral compounds, and although L-AAs are the predominant
active form in mammalian biology, the presence of D-AAs in living
organisms and in the environment has been reported extensively.1 Over the years, several analytical methods able
to distinguish D and L AA enantiomers have been developed. Separation
techniques, such as liquid chromatography (LC), gas chromatography
(GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE), are the most commonly employed
techniques in chiral AA analysis.5−7 Their enantioseparation
principle mostly relies on the selectivity provided by chiral stationary
phases and/or selectors, and separation times typically range between
5 and 30 min.8−11

Mass spectrometry (MS), and in particular tandem MS, has emerged
as an alternative technique for the fast chiral analysis of AAs. In
this approach, enantiomers are first transformed into diastereomeric
complexes using a chiral agent, and the chiral distinction is based
on the different relative intensities of the fragment ions obtained
for the respective AA enantiomers. However, interpretation of complex
fragmentation patterns can be difficult, and as no actual separation
of enantiomers takes place, enantiopure reference compounds are required.12,13

Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) has demonstrated to be a powerful
tool for the fast separation (milliseconds) of isobaric and isomeric
compounds. In drift-tube IMS, ions are separated based on their mobility
in an electric field through a neutral gas. As the mobility is a function
of the ion collision cross section (CCS), which depends on the size
and shape of the ion in the gas phase, compounds may be separated
by IMS, even if their m/z ratio
is the same.14 In 2011, Fernández-Lima
et al. introduced trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS)15,16 in which ions are carried into the drift cell using a nitrogen gas
flow. An electric field gradient is applied in the opposite direction
in order to trap and separate ions depending on their size, charge,
and shape.17 This allows use of much shorter
IM drift tubes,18 while potentially achieving
a high resolving power (up to 300), providing the possibility to attain
fast separations of isobaric and isomeric compounds.19 In TIMS, resolution (or resolving power) R is often defined as K/ΔK where K is the mobility and ΔK is the full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of a compound peak in the
mobilogram.17

Compound enantiomers
exhibit identical CCSs, making their direct
separation by IMS not feasible. In order to achieve chiral separation
of enantiomers by IMS, several strategies have been adopted, such
as creating an asymmetric environment in the drift tube by doping
the drift gas with a chiral agent20,12 or by inducing
a conformational change with a complexing agent leading to different
CCSs of the studied enantiomers.21,14,22 Chiral separation of AAs by IMS has been studied
by few researchers. Prabha et al. achieved the enantioseparation of
the AAs Ser, Met, Thr, Phe, and Trp by doping the drift gas with a
volatile chiral reagent ((S)-(+)-2-butanol).12 Further works on the enantioseparation of AAs
by IMS employ the formation of noncovalent diastereomeric complexes
of the AAs with a metal-ion containing chiral reference agent prior
to IMS analysis.22,14,21 Mie et al. first demonstrated the potential of this approach by
the enantioseparation of six AAs using high-field asymmetric waveform
ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS). They formed metal-bound trimeric
complexes of the form [M(II)(L-ref)2(D/L-AA)-H]+ where M was Ni, Zn, Mg, or Cu, AA was Trp, Pro, Phe, Val, Arg, and
Lys, and L-ref is the AA acting as a chiral reference compound.22 Using traveling wave ion mobility spectrometry
(TWIMS), Domalain et al. described the differentiation of seven AA
enantiomers through their cationization with copper(II) and a reference
AA. After screening 11 AAs, D-Phe was selected as the most suitable
chiral reference compound.14 In a similar
way, Xiangying Yu et al. studied the chiral separation of Trp, Gln,
Tyr, Thr, His, Glu, Met, Phe, and Arg by forming binuclear copper
bound tetrameric ions with L-Trp, L-Pro, L-Tyr, L-Phe, and L-His as
reference.21 The main limitation of these
approaches is the need for specific reference compounds for each AA,
limiting general application. Moreover, the enantiomeric discrimination
was only demonstrated for individual AAs, i.e., no mixtures of AAs
were analyzed.

The present work proposes a new alternative and
generic approach
for achieving chiral separation of AAs by employing TIMS. To this
end, prior to TIMS analysis the AA enantiomers were quickly converted
to diastereomers with the chiral reagent (+)-1-(9-fluorenyl)ethyl
chloroformate (FLEC). Subsequently, the diastereomers were efficiently
separated based on their difference in ion mobility. In total, 22
proteogenic and nonproteogenic AAs were included in the study and
parameters affecting IMS separation were evaluated. The novel enantioselective
TIMS method is fast and applicable to any chiral AA, omits the need
for AA-specific reference compounds, and allows one to resolve multiple
AAs in one run.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
All
reagents employed were of analytical
grade. Sodium tetraborate, lithium carbonate, (+)-FLEC (18 mM in acetonitrile),
9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl chloride (FMOC-Cl), ammonium hydroxide
(28%, w/v), acetic acid, and sodium hydroxide were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Potassium carbonate was obtained from
Acros Organics (New Jersey). Acetonitrile (ACN) was supplied by Fluka
(Steinheim, Germany). Water was deionized and purified with a Milli-Q
purification system (Millipore, Belford, NJ).

DL- and L-forms
of tyrosine (Tyr), alanine (Ala), valine (Val), phenylalanine (Phe),
tryptophan (Trp), histidine (His), arginine (Arg), lysine (Lys), isoleucine
(Ile), methionine (Met), leucine (Leu), asparagine (Asn), serine (Ser),

acid (Aad), and selenomethionine (SeMet), and D-glutamine (D-Gln),
L-glutamine (L-Gln), D-pipecolic acid (D-Pipe), D-ornithine (D-Orn),
and glycine (Gly) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Madrid, Spain),
whereas D-citrulline (D-Cit), L-citrulline (L-Cit), L-pipecolic acid
(L-Pipe), and L-ornithine (L-Orn) were obtained from Fluka (Buchs,
Switzerland).

Trapped Ion Mobility Spectrometry
TIMS-TOFMS analysis
was performed on a TIMS-TOF instrument from Bruker Daltonik (Bremen,
Germany) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. A
daily calibration was performed using the Agilent ESI low concentration
Tune mix. Two types of calibrations were applied. In the first, a
wide voltage scan allowed detection of all ions from the calibrant
solution. Herewith a calibration from m/z 322.0212 to m/z 2121.9331 covering
a 1/K0 range (K0 is the reduced mobility) from 0.7319 to 1.7286, allowing
correction of small day-to-day variations in measured mobilities.
For higher resolution IM analysis, calibration was performed over
a smaller mobility ranges (1/K0, 0.7319–0.9848) using two or
three m/z values (322.0481, 622.0290,
922.0098). In the latter case, the ramp voltage range was kept constant
but shifted to lower or higher voltages to detect all the required
calibrant ions. Samples were directly injected using a syringe pump
from Cole-Parmer (Vernon Hill, IL) with a glass syringe of 1 mL from
Hamilton (Bonaduz, Switzerland) at a flow rate of 180 μL/h.
The TIMS was operated in positive-ion mode with an electrospray voltage
of 4.5 kV. The mass range was set at m/z 100–3000. The ionization source conditions were end plate
offset, 500 V; nebulizer pressure, 0.5 bar; drying gas, 4 L/min at
200 °C. The TOFMS settings were rf funnel 1, 150 Vpp; rf funnel
2, 300 Vpp; isCID energy, 0 eV; multipole rf, 150 Vpp; quadrupole
ion energy, 5 eV at low mass of 50 m/z; collision energy, 8 eV; collision rf, 600 Vpp; transfer time, 55
μs; prepulse storage, 1 μs.

TIMS was operated using
two different modes. First, samples were analyzed using a wide voltage
scan (109–160 V) to provide a general overview of the elution
voltages. This mode was operated using general conditions of ion mobility
such as ramp start V, 109 V; ramp end V, 160 V; ramp time, 255 ms;
accumulation time, 50 ms. Subsequently, TIMS parameters (accumulation,
ramp voltages, and ramp time) were adjusted to obtain maximum resolving
power for a particular set of DL-AAs. The duty cycle was 80%. Optimum
conditions are reported in the Results and Discussion.

Sample Preparation
Stock solutions of each AA were
prepared dissolving the appropriate amount of AA in a buffer solution.
Sodium tetraborate buffer solution (26 mM in Milli-Q water, pH 9.2)
was employed as buffer solution to dissolve the AAs before the derivatization
step. Lithium carbonate and potassium carbonate solutions (26 mM each)
were prepared in Milli-Q water and adjusted with 20% acetic acid to
pH 9.2. These AA solutions were stored at 4 °C until the derivatization
step with FLEC.

Derivatization of AAs was performed according
to Prior et al.23 The 18 mM (+)-FLEC in
ACN was freshly prepared each day. Briefly, 50 μL of a 90 μg/mL
AA solution in 26 mM sodium tetraborate (pH 9.2) were mixed with 50
μL of 12 mM (+)-FLEC dissolved in ACN. The solution was kept
at room temperature for 10 min to complete reaction, and the resulting
solution was diluted 1:1 in Mili-Q water–ACN (50:50, v/v) before
infusion into the ESI-TIMS-TOFMS system.

Data Analysis
Resolution (R) was determined
from the measured mobilograms (1/K0 vs intensity) according R = K0/ΔK0 where K0 is the reduced mobility of the
respective analyzed diastereomer and ΔK0 its peak width at half
height (fwhm). The peak mobilities (1/K0), the fwhms and ion collision
cross sections (CCS) were obtained using the Compass Data Analysis
5.0 software from Bruker Daltonik.

Results and Discussion
Chiral
Resolution of FLEC-AAs by TIMS
Ions of enantiomers
of an AA have identical charge, m/z, and CCS, making their direct separation by IMS not feasible. Up
until now, separation of AA enantiomers by IMS has been achieved by
using gas-phase ion complexation with volatile chiral agents or by
forming metal-ion noncovalent complexes with reference compounds.12,22,24,25 Since TIMS has demonstrated to be a powerful tool for the fast separation
of isobaric or isomeric compounds,19 we
have explored the potential of TIMS to resolve chiral AAs by first
forming diastereomers in solution. For that purpose, we selected the
chiral agent (+)-FLEC which reacts covalently and fast with the amino
group of an AA, resulting in two diastereomers per pair of enantiomers
(Figure 1A). Initial
experiments were performed using DL-SeMet and DL-Orn as model compounds.
Orn contains two amine groups leading to two FLEC molecules per AA.
No singly derivatized FLEC-Orn was observed when analyzed by MS. ESI
of the FLEC-AAs resulted in a mixture of protonated and sodiated ions.
The sodium ions largely originate from the buffer employed for derivatization.
When analyzed by TIMS, for the protonated ions ([FLEC2-Orn
+ H]+, [FLEC-SeMet + H]+) and ions containing
one Na ion per molecule ([FLEC2-Orn + Na]+,
[FLEC-SeMet + Na]+), a single peak was observed for each
AA (Figure S1). On the other hand, the
extracted-ion traces of the disodiated ions [FLEC2-Orn
+ 2Na – H]+ and [FLEC-SeMet + 2Na – H]+ both revealed two baseline separated peaks, suggesting separation
of the respective diastereomers (Figure 2A,C, respectively). As negative control,
we also carried out the AA derivatization by FMOC-Cl. FLEC and FMOC
have very similar structure, only differing a methyl group on the
acyl moiety, rendering FMOC to be nonchiral (cf. parts A and B of Figure 1). Consequently,
FMOC derivatization of AAs results in two pair of enantiomers and
not diastereomers. When monitoring [FMOC2-Orn + 2Na –
H]+ and [FMOC-SeMet + 2Na – H]+, no separation
is observed (Figure 2), indicating that TIMS indeed provides the FLEC-AA diastereomer
separation.

+ 2Na – H]+, and (D) [FMOC-SeMet + 2Na –
H]+.

Theoretically, multiple
analyte peaks in (T)IMS may result from
different positions of the adduct charge (i.e., occurrence of protomers
and/or sodium-adduct isomers).19,26 In order to exclude
this possibility and to confirm that separation of diastereomers was
achieved, L-Orn and L-SeMet, and D/L mixtures of these AAs (ratio
D/L, 1:1 and 1:3) were analyzed. For both FLEC-AAs, only one peak
was observed for the L enantiomer (Figure 3A,B), whereas two peaks were observed for
the 1:1 and 1:3 D/L mixtures, with the former showing similar peak
heights and the latter showing clearly higher peak intensities for
the L-form. The analysis of the nonchiral AA Gly was also carried
out after derivatization with FLEC. This yielded one single peak in
the mobilogram (Figure S2), again supporting
the conclusion that the separation observed in TIMS indeed is caused
by structural difference of the AA diastereomers and not by difference
in adduct-ion position in the molecule or another reason.

Effect of the Alkali Cation on the Enantioseparation
Our
initial results indicated that sodium-adduct formation was essential
for the separation of the AA enantiomers by TIMS. This observation
is in line with previous research on separation of isomeric molecules
by IMS, where the formation of alkali-cation adducts demonstrated
to be a prerequisite for their efficient separation.14,19,21 We also studied the effect of
potassium and lithium cations on the chiral separation of AAs. FLEC
derivatives of SeMet and Orn were prepared in solutions containing
potassium or lithium ions and then analyzed by TIMS. Figure 4 shows the mobilograms obtained
for the FLEC-AAs in the presence of Li+, Na+, or K+. No separation of FLEC-AA diastereomers was obtained
when Li+ was used, whereas with K+ partial separation
was observed for FLEC-Orn. Table S1 (Supporting
Information) lists the CCS values obtained for the different FLEC-AA
adducts. For both AAs the CCS increase with the size of the metal
ion. Looking at the CCS of the individual diastereomers it could be
discerned that, when diastereomer separation is achieved, the first
migrating diastereomer exhibits a deviation from this trend in comparison
with the second diastereomer (e.g., CCS 240.3 for [FLEC2-Orn + 2Li – H]+, and 237.7 and 241.5 for the first
and second diastereomer of [FLEC2-Orn + 2Na – H]+, respectively) (Figure S3). This
most probably is the result of a conformational change of the first
migrating diastereomer to a more compact form in the presence of Na+ in comparison to the second diastereomer.

Figure 4 TIMS-TOFMS of FLEC-derivatized
Orn (A) and SeMet (B) showing mobilograms
obtained in the presence of lithium, potassium, and sodium ions.

As the formation of sodium adducts
showed to be crucial for the
separation, the amount of sodium ions in the derivatization buffer
was increased (from 26 mM to 50 mM). No change in diastereomer separation
and intensity was observed, and therefore the concentration of 26
mM was maintained for further experiments (Figure S4A). When the AA concentration was varied (0.1–0.7
mM), the relative intensity of sodium adduct ions formed remained
constant. Furthermore, the ratio between ions containing one and two
sodium ions was constant between experiments (Figure S4B).

Evaluation of TIMS Conditions and Applicability
to Multiple
AAs
In order to further evaluate the potential of TIMS-TOFMS
for separating FLEC-AA diastereomers, 21 AAs (17 proteinogenic and
4 nonproteinogenic AAs) were analyzed. AA solutions prepared in an
enantiomeric ratio (D/L) of 1:1 and 1:3 were derivatized with FLEC
and analyzed by direct infusion TIMS-TOFMS. Ions exiting the glass
capillary are transferred into the TIMS cell by a nitrogen gas flow,
whereas an opposite electrical field gradient is applied to trap and
separate the ions. This takes place first in a TIMS analyzer. After
trapping, the ions are moved to a similar second TIMS analyzer section
where after trapping the electric field is decreased gradually by
lowering the exit potential over time so that the ions are sequentially
liberated into the time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The exit voltage
range and the speed at which this voltage is changed (ramp time) define
the slope of the electric field gradient which affects the resolving
power of TIMS.

Initially, TIMS analysis were carried out using
a wide voltage scan (109–160 V) providing the ion mobilities
for all analyzed AAs. AAs carrying one FLEC per molecule were eluted
at lower voltages than the AAs which contained two FLEC per molecule,
such as Orn and Lys. In order to achieve optimum separation for each
pair of diastereomers, the voltage range was narrowed down to a specific
range and the voltage ramp time was adjusted (Table 1). The TIMS sensitivity depends of the number
of ions trapped in the first TIMS analyzer, which is determined by
the time that ions are accumulated. Too long accumulation times can
result in saturation of the trap and space-charge effects, and therefore
the accumulation was studied between 10 and 100 ms. The FLEC-AA signal
intensities increased with accumulation time until 50 ms, except for
Ser, which showed the highest intensity at 25 ms. Further increase
of the accumulation up to 100 ms did not result in higher signal intensities
for most FLEC-AAs (except for His), suggesting saturation of the trap.
Therefore, the accumulation time was set to 50 ms, but for His and
Ser, 100 and 25 ms were selected, respectively. Table 1 summarizes the ramp voltage, ramp time,
and accumulation time employed for each FLEC-AA as well as the mobility
and mobility differences between the diastereomers obtained under
these conditions. From the 21 chiral AAs studied, separation of the
FLEC diastereomers of 17 AAs was achieved. For Glu, Pro, Thr, and
Ala, no enantioresolution was obtained. Diastereomer separation was
obtained in general for disodiated FLEC-AAs ([M + 2Na – H]+); however, for Ile, Leu, and Val, the diastereomer separation
was observed for the singly sodiated species ([M + Na – H]+). Next to AAs containing two amino groups, Tyr also appeared
to be derivatized with two FLEC molecules, presumably due to a reaction
of FLEC with the Tyr hydroxyl group under the conditions employed
in this study. Figure 5 shows the mobilograms obtained for the resolved AAs and Table S1 their calculated CCS. For a large part,
baseline separation of the FLEC-AA diastereomers was achieved. In
the case of Arg, Lys, His, Met, and Leu, the diastereomers were partially
resolved. The resulting TIMS resolution (K0/ΔK0) for the FLEC-AA
diastereomers on average was 115, requiring a mobility difference
(ΔK0) of about 0.009 cm2/(V s) to achieve 50%-valley
separation. Experimental ΔK0 determined for the analyzed diastereomers
ranged from 0. 009 for Lys (only partially resolved) to 0.061 for
Asn. The particular migration order of the D and L enantiomers seems
to be dependent on the structure of the AA (Table 1). Interestingly, this observation is opposite
to the behavior of diastereomeric FLEC-AAs in capillary electrophoresis,
where D-AAs commonly migrated first.23

Chiral Resolution
of FLEC-AAs in Mixtures
The developed
TIMS-TOF method allowed separation of FLEC-AA diastereomers in less
than 1 min. As all AAs are derivatized under the same conditions,
we addressed the possibility to resolve multiple AAs in one TIMS-TOFMS
run while maintaining chiral selectivity. Considering that the FLEC-AAs
require specific voltage ramps to be chirally resolved, no single
method was able to resolve all AAs. Therefore, three different voltage
ramps were applied in order to achieve separation of most of the FLEC-AAs.
A mixture of Orn, Lys, His, and Tyr was analyzed using a voltage ramp
from 135 to 170 V, a mixture of Asn, Ser, Pipe, and Gln using 100–130
V, and a mixture of Met, Phe, SeMet, and Arg using 109–135
V. For all mixtures, a ramp time of 510 ms was used. The mobilogram
obtained for the analysis of the mixture of Asn, Ser, Pipe, and Gln
(Figure 6) shows diastereomer
separation for all four AAs. Some diastereomers comigrated, but still
the individual AAs could be discerned by their specific m/z value. Similar results were obtained for the
other mixtures of AAs (Figure S5A,B). This
opens new possibilities for analysis of AAs in mixtures, which is
not feasible with ion mobility approaches which require a pure enantiomer
of a different amino acid as chiral reference compound.22,14,21

of a mixture of DL-Asn (m/z, 413.1086), DL-Ser (m/z, 386.0989), DL-Pipe (m/z, 410.1338)
and DL-Gln (m/z, 427.1244) using a voltage ramp of
100–130 V in 510 ms.

The TIMS-TOF method allowed detection of FLEC-AAs down to
the low-nanomolar
level, demonstrating similar sensitivity to previously described analysis
of FLEC-AAs by ESI-MS.23,27 TIMS-TOF showed able to detect
an DL enantiomeric ratio down to 2.5% D indicating the potential of
the method for the determination of the enantiomeric excess in real
samples (Figure S6). The method showed
good reproducibility with RSDs between 0.09% and 0.8% for diastereomer
mobilities, between 1.3% and 9.6% for diastereomer peak areas, and
between 0.1% and 0.9% for the calculated CCS values.

Conclusions
This work presents a new and fast method for the separation of
DL-AA enantiomers by TIMS after derivatization with the chiral reagent
(+)-FLEC. By forming diastereomers before analysis, doping of the
IMS drift gas with a chiral volatile complexing agent is not needed.
When compared to earlier reported approaches, the proposed method
simplifies and uniforms diastereomer formation, avoiding the use of
specific reference compounds, and extending the applicability to a
large number of AAs. Our study indicates that adduct formation with
alkali ions is essential for achieving the separation of the diastereomeric
FLEC-AAs. The new method has shown to be applicable to a variety of
AAs, and chiral separation was achieved for 17 from the 21 AAs studied.
The analyte ions are separated on the millisecond time scale, and
TIMS analysis times of lower than 1 min are sufficient to attain adequate
results. We also have demonstrated that the simultaneous separation
of diastereomers in a mixture by TIMS is very well possible. Taking
the derivatization time (only 10 min) into account, mixtures of AA
enantiomers can be resolved in a total analysis time of less than
15 min. Limits of detection are in the nanomolar range, and determination
of enantiomeric ratios down to 2.5% are feasible. Overall, the presented
methodology provides a promising general approach for separating chiral
compounds with potential applications in different fields, such as
environmental or pharmaceutical analysis. Applications to more complex
matrixes, such as food or biological fluids, will require further
evaluation of the effect of varying sodium ion concentrations in the
samples.
