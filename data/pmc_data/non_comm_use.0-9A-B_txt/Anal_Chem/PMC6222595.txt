Mobility
of proteins and lipids plays a major role in physiological
processes. Platforms which were developed to study protein interaction
between immobilized and mobile proteins suffer from shortcomings such
as fluorescence quenching or complicated fabrication methods. Here
we report a versatile platform comprising immobilized histidine-tagged
proteins and biotinylated proteins in a mobile phase. Importantly,
multiphoton photolithography was used for easy and fast fabrication
of the platform and allows, in principle, extension of its application
to three dimensions. The platform, which is made up of functionalized
polymer structures embedded in a mobile lipid bilayer, shows low background
fluorescence and allows for mobility of arbitrary proteins.

Restrictions
in lateral mobility
of lipids and proteins in the cell membrane have significant impact
on physiological processes. Cell–cell interactions, protein
binding, cell signaling, and molecular transport, for example, depend
on the mobility of cells and proteins.1−6 Migration or accumulation of proteins and lipids in cell membranes
leads to membrane heterogeneities which effect biochemical processes
and mechanical properties of membranes.7 One possibility to mimic such heterogeneities is the construction
of artificial platforms which allow separation of two mobile phases
or the introduction of a mobile and an immobile phase. In the past,
introduction of barriers within an artificial lipid bilayer was realized
by using different micro- and nanostructures made of polymers, alumina,
gold or TiO2,8−10 chromium,11 nanoimprinting of albumin,12 patterning substrates with femtosecond lasers,13 scanning probe lithography,14 or nanopatterned graphene.15 Furthermore,
platforms comprising two different mobile phases were demonstrated.11,16 These geometrically confined supported lipid bilayers found application
in studying physiological processes e.g. in leukemia cell studies,17 T cell signaling,18−20 or the phosphorylation
of the epidermal growth factor.21

In addition to membrane proteins with mobility around the nanopatterned
substrates, fixed proteins anchored to the substrate via well-defined
linkers are equally important for physiological studies. Such anchoring
can be achieved, for instance, via dip-pen nanolithography,22 gold nanoparticles,23,24 nanoimprint lithography,25,26 e-beam lithography,27,28 or multiphoton and stimulated emission depletion (STED) nanolithography.29,30 Physiological applications comprise integrin activation for focal
adhesion sites,23,31 studies on T cell organization
and signaling,32,33 or investigations of lipid organization
in ordered domains in living cells.34

The natural extension of applying either mobile proteins on lipid
membranes or proteins fixed to micro- and nanostructures on a substrate
is to use a hybrid protein platform providing both phases, a mobile
one flowing around a fixed one. This was anticipated by Kung et al.,12 Smith et al.,13 and
Shi et al.14 although only demonstrated
for inactive albumin as fixed protein. Some important physiological
studies using functional fixed and functional mobile proteins were
reported recently. The groups of Groves and Salaita for example studied
epidermal growth factors on breast cancer cells,35−37 while most
recently T cell receptor triggering was successfully investigated
by using a hybrid platform.38 In most of
these studies gold nanoparticles were used to tie down the proteins
in the fixed phase,35,36,38 with the disadvantage of fluorescence quenching by gold particles
which hampers optical readout.39 Although
very small protein anchors of ∼6 nm can be realized, self-assembly
of gold nanoparticles as used by Lohmüller et al.35,36 or Deeg et al.40 is limited to periodic,
mostly hexagonal patterns. TiO2 circumvents fluorescence
quenching,10 but the self-assembled pattern
is again hexagonal. Other techniques, which overcome the disadvantages
of inflexibility in pattern design, were applied but show shortcomings
in fabrication speed and cost. E-beam lithography38 for example provides full flexibility in two and 2.5 dimensions
but is a cost intensive technique, while dip-pen lithography37 shows limited flexibility and is a rather slow
fabrication method. Clearly, there is a demand for alternative hybrid
platforms comprising mobile and immobile proteins which show full
flexibility in platform design as well as fast and cheap fabrication
and ideally account for excellent optical readout. This is especially
of interest, since the present physiological studies are just the
beginning of possible applications.

In this Technical Note,
we demonstrate a versatile hybrid platform
which allows pinning of two different proteins, one in a mobile lipid
bilayer and one immobilized on polymer nanostructures. Importantly,
the nanostructures are fabricated by multiphoton photolithography
(MPP)41,42 which allows for cheap and fast processing
and, in principle, extension of the platform in three dimensions.43 The polymer structures are written by MPP in
a functional acrylate resin and serve as anchor points for arbitrary
histidine-tagged proteins. The mobile phase in which the acrylate
structures are embedded is made of a biotin spiked lipid bilayer and
can be loaded with arbitrary biotinylated proteins. Thus, the two
different immobilization mechanisms via histidine tags on the immobile
phase and the streptavidin bound to the biotinylated lipid bilayer
allow for orthogonal immobilization of proteins. Additionally, the
polymer structure is transparent and shows negligible background fluorescence,
which facilitates optical readout.

Experimental Section
MPP allows for maskless fabrication of two- and three-dimensional
polymer structures with feature sizes down to 100 nm41,42,44−46 and a lateral
resolution around 200 nm.47 Carboxy-functional
polymer structures can be written using a photoresist consisting of
a carboxy-modified acrylate and a photoinitiator.48 The monomers are pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA, Sigma-Aldrich
Co., USA) and 20 wt % 2-carboxyethyl acrylate (CEA, Sigma-Aldrich
Co., USA). One wt % Irgacure 819 (IC 819, BASF Schweiz AG, Switzerland)
was added as photoinitiator. For control measurements, structures
without carboxy-functionality were fabricated using pure PETA with
1 wt % of IC 819. The chemical structures of the photoresist ingredients
as well as detailed information about the experimental design and
the sample preparation can be found in the Supporting Information.

After fabrication and development, the polymer
structures were
cleaned by rinsing with ethanol and incubation with ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid buffer. 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine vesicles
(POPC, Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., USA)49,30 with 4 wt
% of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N
(cap biotinyl) (sodium salt) (16:0 Biotinyl Cap PE, Avanti Polar Lipids
Inc., USA) were sonicated for 20 min and incubated for another 20
min, leading to a biotin-modified supported lipid bilayer enclosing
but not covering the previously fabricated polymer anchors (see Figure 1a).8,30,48,50,51 After washing with 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES) buffer (pH 7.5, 50 mM), the carboxy groups on the polymer
anchors were converted to N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters (Figure 1b). After a second
washing step, amino-labeled nitrilotriacetic acid (NH2–NTA)
was covalently bound to the NHS esters (Figure 1c). After further washing, an aqueous solution
of nickel(II) chloride was added.28,52,53 To ensure binding specificity of histidine-tags to
Ni-NTA, the eventually remaining carboxy groups and NHS esters were
blocked using albumin. The chelation of nickel ions and the passivation
with albumin is shown in Figure 1d. Subsequently, we added histidine-tagged photoswitchable
monomeric protein orange (PSmOrange) (Figure 1e) or histidine-tagged emerald green fluorescent
protein (EmGFP). Then, fluorescently labeled streptavidin was added
and attached to the biotin within the lipid bilayer (Figure 1f).54 The immobilization of histidine-tagged EmGFP or PSmOrange to the carboxy-functional
acrylate structure via Ni-NTA interaction
as well as binding of Alexa Fluor 555 labeled streptavidin to
the lipid bilayer was analyzed via fluorescence microscopy using excitation
wavelengths of 491 nm, 642 nm, and 532 nm, respectively. The photoinitiator
IC 819 used in writing the polymer structures shows a negligible fluorescence
signal at excitation with 491 nm, 532 nm, or 642 nm.30 The chemical structures of the molecules used for protein
anchoring can be found in the Supporting Information.

Results and Discussion
Protein
Immobilization
The selectivity of histidine-tag
mediated protein binding via Ni-NTA to carboxy-functional acrylate
structures is shown by comparing EmGFP binding to polymer grids with
and without carboxy-functionality, offset by half a period in both
lateral directions (see the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image
in Figure 2a). The
polymer lines have line widths of about 130 nm. The weak fluorescence
signal of the polymer lines fabricated with pure PETA stems from autofluorescence
of the structure and unspecifically bound proteins. Fluorescence of
the Ni-NTA-functional polymer grid is about 10 times higher compared
to the fluorescence from the pure PETA grid (Figure 2b). Additional data from control experiments
are shown in the Supporting Information.

structure but only weak binding to the pure PETA grid. Excitation

(a) and (b).

Hybrid Protein Platform
The carboxy-functional polymer
anchors have diameters of about 100 nm. First, the fluorescent histidine-tagged
protein PSmOrange was immobilized on polymer anchors following the
strategy shown in Figure 1(a-e). Subsequently, streptavidin labeled with Alexa Fluor
555 was adhered to the biotin-spiked POPC bilayer as sketched in Figure 1f. Figure 3a shows a fluorescence image
of the carboxy-acrylate dots with immobilized histidine-tagged PSmOrange
(excitation wavelength 642 nm). The fluorescent proteins bind to the
polymer anchors. Fluorescence from the Alexa Fluor 555 labeled streptavidin,
adhered to the lipid bilayer, is shown in Figure 3b (excitation wavelength 532 nm). Figure 3c shows an overlay
of both images. A movie of Alexa Fluor 555 labeled streptavidin
diffusing around the fixed PSmOrange can be found in the Supporting Information. In order to quantify
the two-dimensional movement of the streptavidin within the bilayer,
trajectories were analyzed (Figure 3d). To determine the diffusion constant, a mean square
displacement (MSD) statistic (Figure 3e) was applied. The diffusion constant was determined
applying a two-dimensional model of free diffusion with MSD(t) = MSD0 + 4Dt (solid line), fitted using the first three points in
the MSD(t) plot.49 The resulting mean square
displacement versus time plot yields a diffusion constant of D = 0.38 ± 0.09 μm2/s. The offset
MSD0 of the linear fit in the MSD(t)-plot corresponds to
a positional accuracy of 193 nm.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, a platform for binding of two different proteins,
one diffusing on a supported lipid bilayer and the other fixed to
acrylate anchors, is presented. Two different types of fluorescent
proteins (EmGFP or PSmOrange) were specifically immobilized on acrylate
structures of about 100 nm in size, bearing carboxy-functionality
which is further converted to provide specific Ni-NTA/histidine-tag
interaction. Another protein (Alexa Fluor 555 labeled streptavidin)
is bound to a lipid bilayer, spiked with biotinylated lipids and surrounding
the acrylate anchors. The streptavidin is moving within the lipid
bilayer, flowing around the fixed fluorescent proteins. This two-component
system, combining both, a mobile and an immobile fraction of different
proteins, is well suited for the analysis of protein–protein
interactions in living cells. Acrylate protein anchors show much less
fluorescence quenching than gold nanoparticles, which have been used
in previous platforms for two-phase protein binding. The versatile
platform allows immobilization of any histidine-tagged protein to
the NTA binding sites as well as incorporation of any biotinylated
protein in the mobile phase.55 Importantly,
the histidine-tag and the biotin–streptavidin linkage is independent,
hence binding of two different types of proteins, one mobile, one
fixed, should be easily achievable for a wide range of physiological
problems. This extends the applicability of this hybrid protein platform
way beyond the two previously described examples of studies on epidermal
growth factors35−37 or T cell signaling.38 In comparison to e.g. e-beam lithography, MPP is less cost-intensive
and provides three-dimensional writing capability. Further, it is
thinkable, that using STED lithography the structure size could be
reduced to lateral sizes of around 60 nm.48,56 The height of the polymer structures can be varied from 20 nm (MPP)
down to 10 nm (STED lithography).29 We
previously showed that 80% of nanoanchors (size about 60 nm) can carry
only one antibody.29 Hence, an application
for direct protein–protein interaction can be expected.
