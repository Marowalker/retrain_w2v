Liquid
chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is
the method of choice for analysis of covalent modification of DNA.
DNA adductomics is an extension of this approach allowing for the
screening for both known and unknown DNA adducts. In the research
reported here, a new high-resolution/accurate mass MSn methodology
has been developed representing an important advance for the investigation
of in vivo biological samples and for the assessment of DNA damage
from various human exposures. The methodology was tested and optimized
using a mixture of 18 DNA adducts representing a range of biologically
relevant modifications on all four bases and using DNA from liver
tissue of mice exposed to the tobacco-specific nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone
(NNK). In the latter experiment, previously characterized adducts,
both expected and unexpected, were observed.

==== Body
Liquid chromatography
coupled
with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has become the method of choice for
the characterization and quantitation of covalent modification of
DNA in various biological samples.1,2 However, the
standard methodology focuses on the investigation of small numbers
of anticipated DNA adducts based on a priori assumptions regarding
the formation of specific adducts. This approach does not account
for the complexity of in vivo DNA adduct formation resulting from
endogenous sources, such as oxidative stress or lipid peroxidation,
or as a result of exposure to complex mixtures of chemicals which
cannot be completely anticipated or predicted. In the era of genome-wide
association studies and development of -omics techniques, new technologies
are needed to allow investigation of effects arising from environmental
exposure in all its complexity.3 In this
context, DNA adductomics is emerging as a method for screening for
both known and unknown DNA adducts and is prompting activity by several
research groups.4−15

The LC-MSn methodology for adductomics experiments
relies
primarily on the general observation that the collisional-induced
dissociation of protonated modified deoxyribonucleoside ions results
in the loss of the deoxyribose moiety and the formation of the corresponding
protonated modified nucleobase ions. In a typical experiment, DNA
samples are enzymatically hydrolyzed to free deoxyribonucleosides
with the resulting sample analyzed by LC-MSn for neutral
loss of m/z = 116 corresponding to the deoxyribose group.

The most common
approach has been to perform LC-MS2 analysis
using triple quadrupole instrumentation operated in the constant neutral
loss (CNL)6−8,13 or “pseudo”
CNL mode.5,9−12,14 In CNL mode, quadrupole 1 (Q1) and Q3 are scanned simultaneously
over a large mass range with a constant offset of 116 amu. The pseudo-CNL
approach is similar to CNL; however, instead of actually scanning
the quadrupoles, the system is set to monitor many (25 to 50) 1 amu
spaced contiguous selected reaction monitoring (SRM) transitions all
involving the loss of 116 amu with multiple injections (typically
7–15) covering different mass ranges, so that a large range
is ultimately covered for a given sample. The triple quadrupole approach
has many positive attributes including simplicity of both methodology
and data analysis and relatively low instrumentation costs. However,
it is limited in both its selectivity and identification capability
due to its “low-resolution” data acquisition and lack
of fragmentation beyond MS2.

The field of DNA adductomics
is in its infancy, and thus there
are many opportunities for significant improvement, especially considering
the rapidly improving capabilities of MS instrumentation. The method
we describe here is a unique and innovative nanoelectrospray ionization/high-resolution
MS approach. It uses high-resolution/accurate mass monitoring of the
neutral loss of the 2′-deoxyribose (116.0474 amu) moiety with
triggering of MS3 fragmentation to increase the specificity
of the fundamental adduct identification step and the presence of
an MS3 event indicating the observation of an adduct. In
addition, the accurate mass measurement of the observed DNA adducts
allows for determination of the likely elemental composition of the
adduct. The MS3 fragmentation which is triggered upon observation
of the accurate mass loss of deoxyribose provides additional adduct
structural information. Finally, the methodology outlined here is
unique in that it uses nanospray ionization (300 nL/min) to take advantage
of the inverse relationship between flow rate and electrospray sensitivity.16,17 This maximized sensitivity is especially important, because sample
sizes of in vivo sources of DNA are typically limited and adduct levels
are low.

In the research reported here, we tested and optimized
the performance
of the approach by analyzing a mixture of 18 DNA adducts including
modifications of all four nucleobases at various reactive sites producing
adducts with differing polarities. We also investigated the effect
of a real sample matrix on DNA adduct detection in the standard mix.
Lastly, DNA from liver tissue of mice exposed to the tobacco-specific
nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) was
analyzed to assess the ability of the method to detect expected DNA
adducts and screen for unknown adducts formed in vivo.

Medical Center. The mixture of 18 standards was dissolved in H2O/CH3OH 80:20 at a final concentration of 100 fmol/μL
for each standard. Ethanol was obtained from AAPER Alcohol and Chemical
Co. (Shelbyville, KY). Puregene DNA purification solutions were obtained
from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Calf thymus DNA was purchased from Worthington
Biochemical Corporation (Lakewood, NJ). All other chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. All solvents used for HPLC and MS analysis were
of the purest grade commercially available.

Human Leukocyte DNA
This study was approved by the
University of Minnesota Institutional Review Board. Blood samples
were obtained by venipuncture from two nonsmokers. Leukocytes were
isolated from freshly collected peripheral whole blood. DNA was isolated
using the DNA purification from the buffy coat protocol (Qiagen Corp,
Valencia, CA) with several modifications.25 Briefly, 3 mL of RBC cell lysis solution were added to 1 mL of buffy
coat prepared from 10 mL of whole blood. The white blood cell pellet
was collected by centrifugation (2000g × 10
min), treated with 3 mL of cell lysis solution and incubated at room
temperature overnight. A solution of RNase A (4 mg/mL) was added (15
μL), and the sample was incubated at room temperature for 2
h. One milliliter of protein precipitation solution was added to the
cell lysate, and the mixture was centrifuged (2000g × 15 min) to remove proteins. DNA was precipitated from the
supernatant by addition of 4 mL of isopropanol. The DNA pellet was
washed with 1 mL of 70% ethanol in H2O and then 1 mL of
100% ethanol. DNA was dried in a stream of N2 and stored
at −20 °C until use.

Treatment of Mice with
NNK
This study was approved
by the University of Minnesota Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
and was performed in accordance with NIH guidelines. Female A/J mice,
5–6 weeks old, were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar
Harbor, ME) and were housed, five animals per cage, under standard
conditions and maintained on American Institute of Nutrition-93-G
diet (Dyets, Inc., Bethlehem, PA). Animals were exposed to 3 μmol
(621 μg) NNK, by gavage in 0.1 mL of cotton seed oil once a
week for 4 weeks, and were sacrificed 24 h after the last treatment.
Livers were removed, immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at
−80 °C.

DNA Isolation from Mouse Liver
Mouse
liver (700 mg)
was cut into small pieces, added to 12 mL cell lysis solution (Qiagen),
and homogenized with a Tissue Ruptor (Qiagen) for 2 min at medium
speed. The sample was then processed as reported above following the
protocol for DNA isolation from human leukocytes. Reagent volumes
were scaled accordingly following the manufacturer’s recommendations.

DNA Hydrolysis
DNA (∼500 μg) was dissolved
in 400 μL 10 mM Tris/5 mM MgCl2 buffer (pH 7) and
was initially digested overnight at room temperature with 350 units
(U) of DNase I (type II, from bovine pancreas). To the resulting mixture
were added an additional 350 additional U of DNase I, 225 mU of phosphodiesterase
I, 32.5 mU of phosphodiesterase II, and 750 U of alkaline phosphatase,
followed by incubation at 37 °C overnight. The enzymes were then
removed by centrifugation using a centrifree MPS ultrafiltration device
(MW cutoff of 30 000; Amicon, Beverly, MA). All steps of the
protocol were performed using silanized glass vials.

HPLC Purification
and Fraction Collection
The hydrolysate
was reduced to a volume of about 300 μL under reduced pressure.
Fractionation was carried out with an Agilent 1100 HPLC with a diode
array UV detector operated at 254 nm (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto,
CA). A 4.6 × 25 cm Luna 5 μm C18 column (Phenomenex, Torrance,
CA) was used with a CH3OH in H2O gradient at
a flow rate of 700 μL/min. The gradient was as follows: 5% CH3OH, 5 min; then increased to 20% CH3OH in 1 min
and held for 5 min; then increased to 30% in 2 min and held for 5
min; then to 40% in 1 min and held for 5 min; then to 50% in 1 min
and held for 5 min; then to 70% in 1 min and held for 5 min; and finally
to 100% in 1 min and held for 5 min between 37 and 43 min. Fraction
collection started 6 min after the beginning of the run. Fractions
were collected every 3 min for a total of 12 fractions collected for
each sample injected. The fractions were then dried under reduced
pressure. Residuals from fractions 2 to 7 were resuspended in 20 μL
H2O, whereas residuals from fractions 8 to 12 were resuspended
in 20 μL of 20% CH3OH in H2O. All steps
of the protocol were performed using silanized glass vials.

LC-MS
Parameters
One microliter of sample was injected
onto a NanoLC-Ultra 2D HPLC (Eksigent, Dublin, CA) system equipped
with a 5 μL injection loop. Separation was performed with a
capillary column (75 μm ID, 10 cm length, 15 μm orifice)
created by hand packing a commercially available fused-silica emitter
(New Objective, Woburn MA) with 5 μm Luna C18 bonded separation
media (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The flow rate was 1000 nL/min for
5.5 min, then decreased to 300 nL/min with a 40 min linear gradient
of 2 to 30% CH3CN in 5 mM NH4OAc aqueous buffer
(pH 6.8), followed by a 5:95 buffer/CH3CN hold for 10 min
and a 5 min re-equilibration at 1000 nL/min 98:2 buffer/CH3CN. The injection valve was switched at 6 min to remove the sample
loop from the flow path during the gradient. Samples were analyzed
by nanoelectrospray using an LTQ Orbitrap Velos instrument (Thermo
Scientific, Waltham, MA). The nanoelectrospray source voltage was
set at 1.6 kV, and the capillary temperature was 350 °C. The
ion focusing and transfer elements of the instrument were adjusted
for maximum signal intensity by using the automated instrument tuning
feature while monitoring the background ion signal of m/z = 371.1 amu (decamethylcyclopentasiloxane)
to create the tune file used for data analysis. This resulted in an
S-Lens RF level setting of 62%.

CNL-MSn Data-Dependent
Scanning
Analysis
was performed with full scan detection followed by data-dependent
MS2 acquisition and constant neutral loss triggering of
MS3 fragmentation. Full scan (250–600 amu) detection
was performed using the Orbitrap detector at a resolution of 60 000 (at m/z 400) with 1 microscan (one mass analysis followed
by ion detection),
automatic gain control (AGC) target settings of 1 × 106, and a maximum ion injection time setting of 100 ms. For the analysis
of mouse liver DNA, seven injections were made using different 50
amu ranges covering a total range of 250–600 amu. MS2 fragmentation was performed in the ion trap on the three most intense
full scan ions from the full scan spectra with Orbitrap detection
at a resolution of 7500, automatic gain control (AGC) of 2 ×
105, 1 microscan, maximum ion injection time of 100 ms,
and full scan injection waveforms enabled. MS2 fragmentation
parameters were as follows: 3 amu isolation width, normalized collision
energy of 35, activation Q of 0.25, and activation time of 10 ms.
Data-dependent parameters were as follows: triggering threshold of
500, repeat count of 1, exclusion list size of 500, exclusion duration
of 60s, and exclusion mass width of ±5 ppm. A reject mass list
(500 ions) was used with a mass tolerance of ±5 ppm consisting
of protonated 2′-deoxyribonucleosides and protonated
2′-deoxyribonucleoside artifacts as listed in Table 1 and the most intense peaks observed in the full
scan (250–600 amu) mass analysis over the total chromatographic
time period of a sample preparation blank. MS3 fragmentation
(2 amu isolation width, normalized collision energy of 35, activation
Q of 0.25, activation time of 30 ms) with ion trap detection was triggered
upon observation of a neutral loss of 116.0474 ± 0.0006 amu (±5
ppm) between the parent ion and one of the 50 most intense product
ions from the MS2 spectrum, provided a minimum signal of
500 was observed. The following MS3 parameters were used:
3 microscans, repeat count of 1, AGC target setting 1 × 104, maximum ion injection time of 50 ms.

Results and Discussion
We used a mixture of 18 DNA adduct
standards (Figure 1) to test and optimize our
methodology. The selected adducts
represent modifications of all four nucleobases at various reactive
sites and with differing polarity. The standards were dissolved in
H2O or CH3OH, combined, and diluted with H2O to reach a final concentration of 100 fmol/μL. One
microliter injections were made. The instrument was set to perform
three scan events: (1) full scan from m/z 250 to 600 at a resolution of 60 000; (2) data-dependent
MS2 analysis (R = 7500) of ions observed
in the full scan event; (3) data-dependent MS3 analysis
triggered by the neutral loss of 116.0474 ± 0.0006 amu from the
MS2 spectrum and the mass of the ion which triggered the
MS2 event.

Figure 1 Structures of the DNA adducts in the mixture of standards,
dR =
2′-deoxyribose.

The high-resolution/accurate mass measurements of the parent
and
product ions allow for selective identification of DNA adducts with
minimal possibility of false positives while providing valuable molecular
formula information. In addition, data-dependent operation is efficient,
because ions can be selected (and rejected) for MS2 fragmentation
based upon their accurate masses. Also, it allows for a higher number
(50) of product ions considered for MS3 fragmentation compared
to the similar “low-resolution” ion trap methodology
of Turesky et al.,4 which used a value
of 10.

Preliminary data from the analysis of DNA samples using
the methodology
described here suggested that the limiting factor for low level adduct
detection was the speed at which ions could be sampled for MS2 fragmentation. To maximize the sampling rate, one microscan
was used for the full and MS2 scan events with a repeat
count value of one for MS2 and MS3 scan events.
Increasing the number of microscans should result in more sensitive
detection of adducts, and higher numbers of repeat counts and microscans
would result in higher certainty of MS2 loss of the ribose
moiety (116.0474 amu) and higher quality MS2 and MS3 spectra. Initial tests suggested that a repeat count of 1
was sufficient for the MS2 identification of DNA adducts
and MS3 spectra which matched those of synthetic standards.
Increasing the repeat count for the MS3 scan events could
be done with minimal impact on the overall sampling rate, because
the majority of the instrument time is spent on the full scan and
MS2 scan events. A relatively high-resolution setting of
60 000 was used for full scan analysis to differentiate the
complex set of ions observed. A significantly lower resolution of
7500 was used for the MS2 analysis, because the fragmentation
spectra is much less complex and scanning time of an Orbitrap analyzer
is inversely proportional to resolution. The lower resolution setting
of the MS2 spectra does not affect the ability of the Orbitrap
to make accurate mass measurements unless there are no unresolved
fragment ions skewing the measured nucleoside ion mass from the true
value. Three microscans were used for the MS3 events to
increase the amount of ion signal detected (compared to one microscan
for MS2 events) with little impact on the MS2 sampling rate, because the number of MS3 triggered events
is relatively small.

An example of the set of data obtained
from each adduct identification
is shown for O2-POB-dT in Figure 2. The signal generated by the MS3 fragmentation
event as shown in Panel A indicates the observance of a DNA adduct
with the corresponding MS3 spectrum providing structural
information including possible base identification. In this example,
the MS3 spectrum of O2-POB-dT
(shown in Panel A.1) contains [POB]+ (m/z = 148.1 amu), [thymine + H]+ (m/z = 127.1 amu), and [C6H4NO]+ (m/z = 106.1
amu) as fragment ions of [O2-POB-dT +
H – 116.0474]+. The measured accurate mass of O2-POB-T is determined from the ion mass in the
MS2 spectrum which triggered the MS3 event.
Likewise, the measured mass of O2-POB-dT
is determined from the full scan ion which triggered the MS2 event (shown in Panel B). Because the data-dependent repeat count
was set to one for both the MS2 and MS3 scan
events, there is one MS2 spectrum and one MS3 spectrum acquired for O2-POB-dT. The
measured mass of O2-POB-dT, as determined
from the full scan spectrum corresponding to the event at 19.17 min,
represented in Panel C, is 390.1658 amu, which is 0.5 ppm from the
actual mass (390.1660 amu).

Figure 2 Output of the high-resolution/accurate mass
adductomic approach
illustrated in the chromatograms and spectrum shown for O2-POB-dT from the standard mixture analysis. Panel A shows
the MS3 scan event signifying detection of an adduct triggered
by a mass difference of 116.0474 amu between an ion mass in the full
scan (event shown in Panel C at 19.17 min) and an ion mass in the
corresponding triggered MS2 spectrum (event shown in Panel
B). Panel A.1 is the MS3 spectrum of O2-POB-dT. Panel C.1 is the accurate mass (5 ppm) extracted
ion chromatogram of m/z = 390.1660
amu (O2-POB-dT) from the full scan spectra..

Accurate mass extracted ion chromatograms
for all standards showed
clear and sharp peaks as illustrated in Figure 3. All standards triggered MS2 fragmentation resulting
in the loss of deoxyribose (116.0474 ± 0.0006 amu) at high mass
tolerance with subsequent triggering of the MS3 events.

obtained upon analysis of a mixture of 18 DNA adducts
(20 fmol of each). Panel A: each channel shows the full scan accurate
mass extracted ion chromatogram of the DNA adducts. Panel B: chromatogram
combining the extracted ion chromatograms of all 18 adducts.

Fragmentation parameters were
optimized using the 18 adduct mix.
The CID collision energy, isolation width, activation time, and activation
Q were varied while monitoring the number of MS3-triggered
events and the MS2 signal intensity. Variation of the activation
time and activation Q from the instrument default values had no effect
on signal intensity. No differences were observed when varying the
CID collision energy from 25 to 55. The isolation width optimization
was more complicated. MS2 signal intensity increased and
reached a plateau as the isolation window was increased and the onset
value of the plateau increased with increasing ion mass. As a compromise
between sensitivity and selectivity, the onset value for a DNA adduct
[N2-(4-OH-butyl)-dG] which had an intermediate
mass (m/z = 340 amu) was determined
to be 3 amu and was used in the method. The number of ions fragmented
per full scan was varied, and the optimal value in terms of triggering
of MS3 events was determined to be 3.

The optimized
method was tested on human leukocyte DNA. A sample
(400 μg) was spiked with 1 pmol of each of the 18 standards,
and a buffer blank (with no DNA) served as a negative control. The
samples were enzymatically hydrolyzed and fractionated by HPLC. Twelve
fractions were collected, dried, redissolved in H2O, and
analyzed. The negative control was similarly analyzed, and no trace
of the adducts was detected. A reject mass list of 500 ions was used
at a mass tolerance of ±5 ppm. This list consisted of the 2′-deoxyribonucleoside
ions, their corresponding electrostatically bound dimer ions (reported
in Table 1), and the most intense peaks observed
in the sample preparation blank. The reject ion lists eliminate MS2 fragmentation of ions, which are present in the background
or due to the various processing steps. Figure 4 illustrates the power of the high-resolution/accurate mass detection
used for this methodology. The observation of the triggered MS3 spectrum corresponding to O6-POB-dG
in human leukocyte DNA allowed for the determination of the mass of
the parent ion by examination of the full scan spectrum which immediately
preceded the MS3 event. Furthermore, the determination
of the parent ion mass allowed for the generation of the extracted
ion chromatogram from the full scan data. The ability to extract ions
with 5 ppm mass tolerance allows for isolation of clear peaks (as
shown in Panel C) from a high full scan background (shown in Panel
A). In contrast, Panel B shows a chromatogram in which the peak is
not clearly visible; this corresponds to the extracted ion signal
under low-resolution/nominal mass accuracy (±0.2 amu) typical
of ion trap and quadrupole instrumentation. Figure 5 summarizes the results obtained upon analysis of the 12 HPLC
fractions. Clear peaks corresponding to 16 of the 18 adducts spiked
into the DNA sample were detected in the accurate mass extracted ion
chromatograms of the full scan data. More importantly, 14 of these
adducts were identified by their corresponding MS3 signal.

These promising results
prompted us to test this analytical approach
on samples from animals exposed to a DNA-adduct-inducing compound
to verify its ability to detect and identify DNA adducts resulting
from a specific exposure. 4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone
(NNK), a potent rodent carcinogen, undergoes cytochrome-P450-mediated
metabolism, resulting in the formation of species that react with
DNA-forming adducts. Pyridyloxobutyl (POB)–DNA adducts and
methyl–DNA adducts are among the major DNA modifications occurring
after reaction of NNK metabolites with DNA. Among these adducts, O6-POB-dG and O2-POB-dT
have been identified and quantified in liver and lung DNA of rats
and mice exposed to NNK18,20 in our laboratories,
and therefore, [pyridine-D4]O2-POB-dT and [pyridine-D4]O6-POB-dG were available to be used as internal standards in our experiment.
The two deuterated analogs (200 fmol each) were added to DNA isolated
from liver of an A/J mouse exposed to NNK before hydrolysis. The sample
was then hydrolyzed, and HPLC fractions were collected. To maximize
sensitivity and identify adducts present at possibly very low levels,
we made seven separate injections per fraction, analyzing for mass
ranges of 50 amu to cover a total mass range of 250 to 600 amu. Multiple
injections increased the required instrumentation time for each fraction
but resulted in a significant increase in the sensitivity of the analysis.
Triggered MS3 signals corresponding to O2-POB-dT and O6-POB-dG and
corresponding to the deuterated internal standards were detected in
fractions 8 and 9, respectively. The full scan measured ion masses
(390.1653 and 415.1716, respectively) which triggered the MS2 and subsequently the MS3 events had masses within 5 ppm
(−1.6 ppm and +2.0 ppm, respectively) of the true masses (390.1660
and 415.1724, respectively). In addition, the MS3 spectra
closely matched spectra obtained from the synthetic standards. The
observation of the internal standards (200 fmol) in this DNA sample
(500 μg or 1.4 μmoles of bases) gives us a measure of
the upper limit of the sensitivity of this methodology of ≤1.4
adducts per 107 nucleosides.

Additional DNA adducts
identified in this experiment through examination
of the MS3 events were O6-Me-dG
in fraction 5, OH-PdG in fraction 6, and O6-PHB-dG in fraction 9. O6-Me-dG and O6-PHB-dG are formed from NNK, whereas OH-PdG
is an endogenous DNA adduct.22 Figure 6 summarizes the MS3 signals and chromatograms
corresponding to the parent ions in the full scan event which triggered
those MS3 events.

the loss of 116.0474 amu. Panel A: POB adducts and their corresponding
internal standards added before the DNA hydrolysis. Panel B: additional
adducts detected in fractions 5, 6, and 9.

This experiment confirmed the power of our “top down”
methodology to reveal the presence of both unexpected and anticipated
DNA adducts in in vivo samples through the combination of the full
scan, MS2, and MS3 signals. Conventional DNA
adduct discovery utilizes a “bottom up” approach where
the formation of specific DNA adducts is hypothesized by considering
the biochemistry of cytotoxins or suspected cytotoxins with confirmation
by in vitro experimentation. This targeted approach, while more direct
and technically more straightforward, does not account for the complexity
of in vivo DNA adduct formation resulting from endogenous sources,
such as oxidative stress or lipid peroxidation or as a result of exposure
to complex mixtures of chemicals which cannot be completely anticipated
or predicted. The high-resolution/accurate mass MSn DNA
adductomic approach outlined here requires no assumptions to be made,
and the analysis, while technically challenging, can be performed
directly on in vivo samples.

There are at least three significant
advantages of using high-resolution/accurate
mass monitoring for adductomics analysis. The accurate mass criterion
for the observation of the neutral loss of the 2′-deoxyribose
(116.0474 amu) provides a dramatic increase in the specificity of
the adduct identification. Second, the accurate mass of an identified
DNA adduct allows determination of its possible elemental composition.
Third, our approach involves acquisition of MS3 spectra
which provide important structural information, including possibly
the identity of the modified base. Triple-quadrupole-based adductomics
approaches have been reported,5−14 but they neither allow for accurate mass determination nor provide
MS3 spectra. In addition, the required scanning of quadrupoles
limits the duty cycle of adduct detection and therefore the sensitivity
of this approach relative to SIM or SRM analyses. We are not aware
of any published examples of high-resolution/accurate mass adductomics
approaches. Van den Driessche and co-workers15 used Q-TOF instrumentation, but they did not report accurate mass
measurements and also were limited to MS and MS2 analysis.
Turesky and co-workers4 developed an adductomics
approach similar to that reported here by utilizing triggering of
MS3 fragmentation upon observation of the neutral loss
of 2′-deoxyribose. However, they used an ion trap instrument
which limited the neutral loss triggering criteria to 116 ± 0.5
amu, not allowing for the high specificity of accurate mass measurement.
In contrast, our method is based on the detection of adducts with
a criteria of 116.0474 ± 0.0006 amu and determines the accurate
molecular mass of both the parent and the fragment ions of the detected
adducts. Additional innovations of the method presented here include
lower flow (300 μL/min) for enhanced sensitivity, incorporation
of background and artifact exclusion lists, and preanalysis fractionation
for improved sensitivity.

The data reported here confirm the
strength and potential power
of our approach, but several areas of improvement are needed. The
major issue limiting the sensitivity and ease of use of this method
is the chemical complexity of the sample. This complexity prompted
use of recombinant DNase, extensive fractionation, and multiple injections
per fraction to achieve sufficient sample purification and sensitivity
for low level DNA adduct detection. In spite of these efforts, the
injected samples still showed significant chemical noise, a problem
which requires further attention. One possible approach to decreasing
background is the exclusive use of recombinant enzymes to perform
DNA hydrolysis. In addition, the cell lysis and tissue processing
solutions used for the isolation of DNA should be examined for their
contribution to excessive chemical noise, and the DNA isolation process
could be modified by including additional DNA purification after isolation.
Changes in chromatographic separation could also be investigated to
deal with the chemical complexity. Further optimization of MS3 fragmentation parameters to improve fragment ion levels and
increase the likelihood of the production of the protonated nucleobases
of the corresponding DNA adducts might be useful. The detection of
the MS3 signal using the Orbitrap detector rather than
the ion trap could be investigated to determine whether the benefits
of accurate mass detection outweigh any reduction in sensitivity.
In addition, the possibility of using higher energy collision-induced
dissociation (HCD) fragmentation for MS2 and MS3 to increase the number of fragment ions thus providing additional
structural information could be investigated.

Conclusion
The
new field of DNA adductomics is still developing and challenges
remain; however, the high-resolution/accurate mass MSn methodology
described here represents an important advance in the investigation
of DNA adduct structures in complex mixtures. This approach could
be an extremely powerful tool in the investigation of the effects
on DNA of complex human exposures.
