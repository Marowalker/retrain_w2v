Diamond is a highly
attractive coating material as it is characterized
by a wide optical transparency window, a high thermal conductivity,
and an extraordinary robustness due to its mechanical properties and
its chemical inertness. In particular, the latter has aroused a great
deal of interest for scanning probe microscopy applications in recent
years. In this study, we present a novel method for the fabrication
of atomic force microscopy (AFM) probes for force spectroscopy using
robust diamond-coated spheres, i.e., colloidal particles. The so-called
colloidal probe technique is commonly used to study interactions of
single colloidal particles, e.g., on biological samples like living
cells, or to measure mechanical properties like the Young’s
modulus. Under physiological measurement conditions, contamination
of the particle often strongly limits the measurement time and often
impedes reusability of the probe. Diamond as a chemically inert material
allows treatment with harsh chemicals without degradation to refurbish
the probe. Apart from that, the large surface area of spherical probes
makes sensitive studies on surface interactions possible. This provides
detailed insight into the interface of diamond with other materials
and/or solvents. To fabricate such probes, silica microspheres were
coated with a nanocrystalline diamond film and attached to tipless
cantilevers. Measurements on soft polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) show
that the manufactured diamond spheres, even though possessing a rough
surface, can be used to determine the Young’s modulus from
a Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT) fit. By means of force spectroscopy,
they can readily probe force interactions of diamond with different
substrate materials under varying conditions. The influence of the
surface termination of the diamond was investigated concerning the
interaction with flat diamond substrates in air. Additionally, measurements
in solution, using varying salt concentrations, were carried out,
which provide information on double-layer and van-der-Waals forces
at the interface. The developed technique offers detailed insight
into surface chemistry and physics of diamond with other materials
concerning long and short-range force interactions and may provide
a valuable probe for investigations under harsh conditions but also
on biological samples, e.g., living cells, due to the robustness,
chemical inertness, and biocompatibility of diamond.

==== Body
In the last 2 decades, the so-called
colloidal probe technique has developed into an indispensable tool
for biological and materials research.1 For this technique, commonly, a single colloidal particle is attached
to a tipless cantilever and used in force spectroscopic measurements
employing an atomic force microscope (AFM).

Probing forces between
single colloids and substrates provides
insight into interfacial properties like substrate adhesion, electrostatics,
and hydration but also mechanical properties of soft matter, e.g.,
living cells or polymer films.2,3 Using soft AFM cantilevers,
due to the large contact area, interfacial forces down to the piconewton
range can be investigated in detail. This has been used for sensitive
studies on fouling resistant membranes and coatings,4 wettability properties,5 bubbles
in liquid,6 and conductive polymer coatings,7 to name a few. However, measurements are often
strongly affected by the lifetime of the colloidal probe, which limits
the measurement time and requires frequent preparation of fresh probes.
Especially when measuring on living cells, only a few reliable data
points can be obtained8 and hence methods
for rapid colloid exchange have been developed.9

In this study, we introduce diamond colloidal probe
force spectroscopy,
using a robust and chemically inert diamond sphere attached to a tipless
AFM cantilever for probing. Diamond is a common coating material for
AFM probes as it is exceptionally hard (Young’s modulus, 1220
GPa) and wear resistant.10 Apart from that,
heavily doped diamond shows metal-like conductance and outstanding
electrochemical properties. Therefore, it has been used to fabricate
conductive tips or serves as electrode material in combined techniques
like AFM-scanning electrochemical microscopy (AFM-SECM).11

Even though it is termed as chemically
inert, chemical modifications
are feasible, e.g., for chemical force spectroscopy.12 It was also shown that proteins in fetal bovine serum can
easily adsorb onto the diamond surface.13 Thermal or plasma treatments can readily modify the surface, e.g.,
for hydrogen or oxygen termination.14,15 Especially,
hydrogen-terminated diamond has some outstanding properties. It is
characterized by strong hydrophobicity, shows surface conductivity,16 and a negative electron affinity (NEA) that
can be used for chemical reactions, e.g., CO2 reduction,
by emission of electrons into solution.17 Depending on the surface termination, also the interaction with
other materials, solvents, and molecules can be significantly altered.
This is even more important for nanomaterials, where surface states
dominate the overall behavior. With diamond colloidal particles, detailed
characterization of surface properties like terminations and dynamics,
e.g., degradation of hydrogenated diamond,18 is feasible but also a robust probe for investigations under harsh
conditions is readily available.

Experimental Section
Sample
Preparation
For the manufacturing of micrometer-sized
diamond spheres, a templated growth method was used that was adapted
from our previous studies.19,20 The 5 μm silica
beads in suspension (50 mg/mL, Kisker Biotech GmbH & Co KG, Germany)
were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min to separate them from the solution.
Then, they were cleaned in a 5:1:1 mixture of water, ammonia, and
hydrogen peroxide to remove organic contaminants and to oxidize the
surface. After separation from the cleaning solution by centrifugation,
the silica spheres were seeded using an aqueous nanodiamond solution
(4 nm nanodiamonds, G01 grade, Plasmachem GmbH, Germany) and gentle
ultrasonic treatment.21 The seeded spheres
were again centrifuged and rinsed with ultrapure water two times before
being suspended in 10 mL of isopropanol (5 mg/mL). A volume of 1 mL
of this suspension was spin-coated (3000 rpm, 30s) onto a 3 in. double-side
polished silicon wafer and dried in air.

Growth of Diamond Spheres,
Pretreatment, and Mounting
Diamond growth was carried out
for 30 min in an ellipsoidal microwave
plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) reactor using purified gases
(H2, CH4) with 3.4 kW microwave power, 3.5%
CH4 in H2 and a chamber pressure of 65 mbar.22 The overgrown particles were then removed from
the silicon substrate by an ultrasonic treatment and suspended in
isopropanol. For further treatments and attachment, the suspension
was drop-coated onto a piece of silicon wafer. O-termination was achieved
in an O2-asher (100-E, TePla, Germany) at 200 W power with
an O2 pressure of 1 mbar for 10 min. H-termination was
carried out in the MPCVD reactor in an H2-plasma for 10
min at 1.3 kW and 40 mbar. Afterward the treated substrates were mounted
in a JPK NanoWizard III AFM (JPK, Germany), and the spherical diamond
particles were attached to tipless AFM cantilevers (HQ:CSC38/tipless/Cr–Au, k = 0.003–0.130 N/m, MikroMasch, Bulgaria) using
a UV-curable glue (OP-4-20641, Dymax). All used diamond spheres were
taken from the same batch and should have a similar roughness of 18
± 2 nm (see also Figure 1 and Figure S1).

AFM cantilevers: (a) H-terminated diamond layer and (b) O-terminated
diamond layer. (c) Single crystallites in a zoomed view of the H-terminated
diamond. (d) Hollow diamond sphere after removal of the silica core

Force Spectroscopic Measurements
After attachment,
each diamond particle was characterized by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM). Then, the probe was calibrated using the thermal noise method.23 The measurements on diamond were carried out
on an approximately 1 × 1 cm2 large piece of polished
polycrystalline diamond (PCD) pretreated by H2-plasma (using
the same conditions as for the diamond spheres) or wet-chemical oxidation,
using a mixture of 1:3 nitric acid and sulfuric acid at 250 °C.
In air and solution, the force spectroscopy was conducted with a set
point force of 5 nN and a tip velocity of 1 μm/s. The used probes
(Figure S5) had a spring constant of 0.09
N/m and 0.14 N/m (for the oxygenated and hydrogenated diamond sphere,
respectively). For the elasticity measurements, a commercially available,
soft polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sample was used (2.5 MPa, Bruker
S.A.S., France). Here, the hydrogenated probe was employed and a set
point force of 50 nN and a tip velocity of 1 μm/s were chosen.
Data processing and evaluation was carried out from 20 to 40 force
curves with the JPK Data Processing software. For evaluating the force
range in solution, an increase by 25 pN was determined, which is above
the noise of approximately 15 pN and not influenced by spikes.

Results
and Discussion
Templated diamond growth on silica is a well-established
technique
and has been used before to obtain, e.g., highly porous diamond substrates
like foams or membranes19,24 but also individual
fibers.25 This is readily achieved by controlling
the surface coverage of the template with nanodiamonds (i.e., seeding).20 Using 5 μm spherical silica particles
seeded with nanodiamonds, diamond coated spheres were grown on a silicon
wafer. The coating was then hydrogenated or oxygenated using a plasma
treatment before attachment to a tipless AFM cantilever.

Characterization
using SEM shows the successful positioning at
the end of the cantilever (Figure 1a). Also, the surface termination shows a strong influence
on the contrast of the SEM images. Whereas the H-terminated colloidal
particle (H-colloid) shows strong contrast of the individual diamond
crystallites, the O-terminated colloidal particle (O-colloid) exhibits
charging effects and less contrast. This is due to the surface conductivity
of H-terminated diamond and proves the successful pretreatment of
the spheres before attachment.16

The grown diamond layer has a crystalline structure with crystallite
sizes in the range of 50–150 nm (Figure 1c). Due to the 3-dimensional template making
contact with the wafer, the particle is truncated on one side where
no diamond was grown (Figure 1a). Apart from that, the diamond layer on the sphere is homogeneous
with 200–300 nm thickness and does not show degradation from
the plasma treatments (Figure 1c and Figure S1). Due to the truncation,
the silica core may be readily removed by etching with hydrofluoric
acid (Figure 1d).

The colloidal probe technique is commonly used to investigate mechanical
properties as the spherical shape ideally fits to the Hertz model
of elastic deformation.26 In air, strong
adhesive capillary forces are present. The Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov
(DMT) model considers adhesion and provides the Young’s modulus
according to eq 1:27 1  F is the applied force, Fadh the adhesion force, ν the Poisson’s
ratio (0.5), E the Young’s modulus, R the radius of the sphere (2.7 μm), and δ the
indentation depth. Due to the large surface area, the colloidal probe
also offers the advantage of exerting lower pressure, which becomes
important when probing fragile samples.

To investigate the indentation
behavior of the diamond colloid,
a commercially available, soft PDMS sample was probed and a DMT fit
was carried out from the obtained approach curves (Figure 2). The obtained Young’s
modulus of 2.59 ± 0.06 MPa is in excellent agreement with the
value specified by the manufacturer (2.5 ± 0.7 MPa) (see also Table S2).

Figure 2 Measurement conducted on elastic PDMS
(Young’s modulus,
2.5 MPa ± 0.7 MPa) and representative approach curve. Inset shows
the data obtained from 22 measurements after DMT fitting.

From the SEM images (Figure 1), the difference in surface termination
is clearly visible.
In the literature, it was shown that O-terminated diamond is hydrophilic
and H-terminated diamond is hydrophobic.28 Thus, the fabricated probes should show different adhesion behavior
in air (where meniscus forces dominate). To further investigate the
influence of the pretreatment, force spectroscopic measurements on
H- and O-terminated PCD (HPCD, OPCD) were carried out. All obtained
force–distance curves exhibit clear differences as shown in Figure 3. For an O-colloid,
we observed the lowest adhesion with 2.74 ± 0.13 nN in all measurements
on HPCD, whereas on an OPCD surface, the measured force was the largest
with 19.25 ± 1.47 nN. For the H-colloid on the OPCD, 6.25 ±
0.32 nN was obtained. These trends can be explained by the wettability
of the substrates, i.e., the different capillary forces. Equation 2 describes these forces (F) in a sphere-plane geometry:29 2  R is the
radius of an ideal
sphere, γ the surface tension of water (71.99 mN/m),30 and θ the meniscus contact angle. It was
shown in other studies that, for rough colloids, the actual colloid
radius needs to be replaced by the radius of the nanoscale asperities.29 With R = 20 nm (see also Figure S1) and a meniscus contact angle of 0°,
this results in a capillary force of 18.09 nN (O-colloid on OPCD).
A contact angle of 81.3° and 69.8° yields a capillary force
of 2.74 nN (O-colloid on HPCD) and 6.25 nN (H-Colloid on OPCD), respectively.
The calculations are in good agreement with the obtained measurements
and literature data.31 For the H-colloid
on OPCD, the slightly decreased contact angle may be caused by the
difference between nanocrystalline diamond and PCD or by a minor surface
oxidation during probe preparation (UV treatment).

Figure 3 Force spectroscopic measurements
using O- and H-terminated colloids
and diamond samples in air. (a) Representative force curves for the
different surface terminations showing approach and retract (inset
shows magnified view of the approach traces). (b) Statistical data
of the measured adhesion. Note: In part a, for the O-colloid and OPCD
where the adhesion force is significantly higher, only the approach
part is shown in the inset for better presentation.

The H-colloid shows an adhesion force of 5.72 ±
0.61 nN on
the HPCD (distribution is significantly different from H-colloid on
OPCD on a significance level of α = 0.001). Due to the hydrophobicity
of both substrates, the meniscus forces should be comparably low.
The rather high adhesion may be explained by the microscopic structure
of water on hydrophobic surfaces, where nanodroplet formation has
been observed.32 These droplets are mobile
and can fuse, which should be dependent on the measurement cycle and
may be the reason for the increased measurement deviation (10.6%)
in this case (see also Figure S4). For
the measurements dominated by capillary forces, the statistical data
shows a narrow, normal distribution with standard deviations in the
range of 5–7% (Figure 3b).

These experiments demonstrate that the diamond colloidal
probe
technique is a valuable method for investigating the material surface
or interface of differently terminated diamond. This plays a huge
role in particular for bonding with other substrates.33 It should be noted that for quantification of such forces,
the environment, i.e., the humidity, should be well-controlled.34 Our measurements were carried out on the same
day at a relative humidity of approximately 40%.

Additionally,
studies in solution were carried out that are less
sensitive to surrounding conditions. In solution, meniscus forces
can be excluded and hence characterization of electrostatic/double-layer,
van der Waals (vdW) forces, and covalent binding are feasible. The
colloids were attached to soft cantilevers and make measurements in
the lower piconewton range possible. Thus, e.g., long-range electrostatic
interactions can also be investigated.

Using an O-colloid, measurements
on OPCD were carried out to investigate
the influence of KCl salt concentration, as previous studies have
shown influences on the assembly behavior of nanodiamonds.21 From the DLVO theory, it is known that high
salt concentrations screen electrostatic interactions.35 By changing the concentration of the added salt,
this can be used to influence the stability of colloidal suspensions,
e.g., for diamond seeding solutions. The obtained results show a decreasing
force range when increasing the KCl concentration in both approach
and retract parts of the curve (Figure 4a). This decrease can be attributed to the decreasing
electrostatic or double-layer forces.

Figure 4 Force spectroscopic measurements using
O-terminated colloids and
diamond samples in solution. (a) Representative force curves at different
KCl concentrations (inset shows magnified view of the approach traces).
(b) Statistical data of the force range (repulsion >25 pN) with
dependence
on the KCl concentration.

The highest values of 183.9 ± 5.1 nm were obtained at
a KCl
concentration of 10–5 M (Note: This value is obtained
by determining an increase in the repulsive force by more than 25
pN). When increasing the concentration, the range decreases to 77.1
± 3 nm for 10–4 M, 20.1 ± 1.6 nm for 10–3 M, and 5.0 ± 1.3 nm for 10–2 M (Figure 4b). As
observed before, the obtained values show narrow normal distributions,
which indicate stable measurement conditions.

The inset in Figure 4a shows representative
approach curves of the measurement. For low
concentrations, the repulsive force goes up to approximately 600 pN
before short-range attractive forces (vdW) dominate and a snap-in
to the surface occurs. This force is strongly decreasing when reaching
10–3 M as attraction outweighs the long-range repulsion
(electrostatics/double-layer forces). As these measurements are not
only influenced by electrostatics, they can be described using the
DLVO theory. Fits of the presented data reveal changes in surface
potential and charge depending on the salt concentration (see Figure S6 and Table S2). The obtained information
is important, e.g., to get insight into diamond-based ion sensitive
field effect transistors (ISFETs).36 However,
it should be noted that at high salt or surfactant concentrations,
where the Debye length is smaller than the roughness, standard DLVO
theory may not be applicable without taking the roughness into account.37 Concerning the adhesion, these measurements
show the strong influence of meniscus forces in air in the previous
measurements (Figure 3). Whereas the adhesion of the O-colloid on OPCD in air was as high
as 20 nN, the adhesion in solution is only around 1 nN (Figure 4a). This is caused by the electrostatic
repulsion originating from the C–O dipole on both surfaces.
The low adhesion also indicates that no covalent bonds are formed,
e.g., by condensation, in the short contact time of approximately
10 ms.

Conclusions
This study demonstrates the usage of diamond
spherical particles
for probing surface mechanical properties and interactions using AFM.
The novel technique is referred to as diamond colloidal probe force
spectroscopy. It was shown that mechanical parameters like the Young’s
modulus can be obtained on soft substrates, which is particularly
interesting for measurements in biological matrixes. Here, contamination
and fouling impede long-term measurements, and diamond may provide
a robust and biocompatible probe surface.38 Measurements in air provide insight into the wettability properties
of this material after different surface treatments. Apart from that,
measurements in solution are feasible, where, e.g., electrostatic
and van der Waals forces can be investigated. This makes detailed
studies on the surface chemistry and physics of diamond films possible,
which can provide a better understanding of the diamond-material interface,
e.g., for nanodiamond seeding processes that are commonly used to
obtain thin film diamond coatings on a variety of substrates. The
statistical evaluations showed narrow normal distributions that prove
the robustness of the approach. Besides the presented experiments,
the technique may be used to study nanotribological properties of
diamond with different surface modifications like fluorine in the
future. In addition, through boron doping, robust, micrometer-sized
spheres have already been fabricated and will be used in future studies
as spherical electrodes to make use of the excellent electrochemical
properties of boron doped diamond electrodes.
