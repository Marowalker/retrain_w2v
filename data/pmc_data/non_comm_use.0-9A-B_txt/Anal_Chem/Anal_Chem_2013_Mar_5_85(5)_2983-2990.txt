Photoresponsive ion extraction/release
systems (PRIONERS) represent
a highly interesting tool for the localized and time-controlled chemical
perturbation of biological materials. We report here on our first
results on phototriggered calcium and sodium exchanging materials.
Such materials exist in two distinct states (“on” and
“off”), depending on the wavelength of illumination.
We used a combination of spectroscopic and electrochemical methods
to obtain a better understanding of the dynamic processes involved
in the triggered ion-exchange reaction upon activation of the photoactive
compound. The driving force for the ion exchange is the light-induced
acidity change of the chromoionophore. Activation with UV light generates
a species in the membrane with an increased pKa. Protons are pulled into the membrane, and at the same time,
ions are expelled. The selectivity of the system is determined by
the employed ionophore. In contrast to photoresponsive ionophore-based
systems, the concept presented here is applicable for virtually any
ion of interest for which an ionophore exists.

==== Body
Ion optodes
based on the competitive
ion exchange between a hydrophobic sensor phase and an aqueous sample
solution were widely applied since their introduction in the late
1980s.1−9 In cases where the ionophore or analyte ion carrier is silent concerning
the optical response to a binding event, one can take advantage of
a secondary reporter dye. Here, the protonation degree of the reporter
dye indirectly monitors the concentration of the analyte in the membrane
phase, as the sensing phase must obey the electroneutrality principle.
This is an elegant approach because it enables the measurement of
various ions using their respective ionophores with the same reporter
dye and optical setup. On the other hand, one can tune the response
region from trace level sensing to completely nonresponsive systems
by choosing the indicator of the respective pKa.10 After the preparation of the
sensor, however, the response function is fixed given that the nature
and total concentration of all components remains constant.

Replacing one of the sensor components with a dynamically changeable
version of the component will transform such sensors from passive
to dynamic devices.11 The triggered change
of the affinity of the ionophore, the charge of the ion exchanger,
or the pKa of the indicator will suddenly
allow for a controlled change in sensor characteristics in space and
time. While light is most often used for triggering such reactions,
other stimuli, such as heat,12 mechanical
stress,13 and electrical activation14 have been reported. The advantage of using light
is the relative ease of combining spatial and temporal control of
the trigger by using readily available imaging equipment such as microscopes
or spectrometers.

We recently reported on the photoinduced acidity
change of a derivative
of the photochromic dye spiropyran inside plasticized PVC membranes.15 This was the first example where the pKa change of the indicator was suggested as the
driving force for a change in equilibrium conditions of an ion-sensing
membrane. We subsequently demonstrated the proof of concept by using
an anion sensor based on the coextraction of protons and chloride
into a lipophilic membrane.16 The ultimate
goal, however, would be a system that can release and extract specific
ions in a highly controlled manner. Calcium, for instance, plays a
crucial role in biology and is involved in the control of such diverse
processes as fertilization, proliferation, development, learning and
memory, contraction and secretion, necrosis, and apoptosis.17,18

Photorelease of small ionic species was reported for protons
based
on photoacid generators19 or the photoisomerization
of organic compounds.20,21 For other ionic species photoactive
chelating compounds were used for reversible22−25 and irreversible affinity changes
(photo cages).26 In our work, however,
the driving force for triggered ion exchange is the change in pKa of a photoactive chromoionophore. This approach
is more flexible than the previous one, because the same photoactive
compound can be used for producing photoresponsive ion extraction/release
systems (PRIONERS) with selectivity toward any ion of interest for
which an ionophore is available.

Here, we report on our first
results on calcium and sodium-selective
PRIONERS based on spiropyran, a well-known photochromic dye that was
previously employed in photoswitchable devices27−30 (Scheme 1). In its original state spiropyran (Sp) exists in its ring-closed
form with a low pKa (1).15 UV illumination generates the ring-opened merocyanine form
(Mc), which exhibits a much higher pKa (2). Due to this change in acidity, the previously passive sensor
becomes active by allowing the exchange of protons and analyte ions
with the contacting sample solution (3). Finally, the inactive state
can be restored by illumination with visible light. Due to the huge,
phototriggered shift in pKa of the involved
indicator, the response curve of such a sensing phase toward changes
in proton or ion activity shifts as well (Figure 1). Therefore, a sensor built in this way can be completely
switched on or off depending on the wavelength of the light used for
illumination, or an ion extraction/release can be initiated using
light. This leads to a range of novel possibilities in the optical
determination and manipulation of ion concentrations. In principle,
switchable sensors allow for the modulation of a sensor signal which
facilitates the background correction in optical detection. Moreover,
the dynamic response of the sensor may reveal certain information
about the microenvironment of the sensor and the speciation of the
analyte. Finally, contact between analyte and active components may
be blocked in the off state.16 This allows
a clear separation of the sensor delivery stage from the actual read-out
stage. Fluorescence and potentiometric measurements showed the change
in response behavior depending on wavelength of the light used for
illumination. Despite the fact that the switching process of the photoactive
compound is a dynamic process with a change of the concentrations
of species inside the membrane, the calibration and selectivity data
fit well to the theoretical response described for equilibrium-based
optodes. Moreover, it was possible to visualize the change in the
response function using a special flow cell for simultaneous electrochemical
and optical characterization of optode membranes. Finally, for naked
eye detection, such sensors might be switched on or off using low-cost
optical devices such as a UV-LED and a laser pointer.

Experimental Methods
Chemicals and Membrane
Preparation
Details on the employed
chemicals and the membrane preparation process can be found in the Supporting Information. Briefly, all membranes
were based on plasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC). The membranes
for optical characterization were spin coated onto poly(ethylene terephthalate)
(PET) foils, while membranes for potentiometric characterization were
produced using conventional solvent casting techniques in a glass
ring. The three different membranes are referred to as “MOCa”
(optical characterization, calcium selective), “MONa”
(optical characterization, sodium selective), and “MPCa”
(potentiometric characterization, calcium selective).

Obtaining the
Optical Response Function
One of the
coated PET foils was placed in a screw-capped, semimicroscale fluorescence
quartz cell. The cell was closed with a silicone septum, placed into
the fluorescence spectrometer (Fluorolog3, Horiba Jobin Yvon), and
utilized as a flow cell by circulating the sample solution with a
peristaltic pump (Gilson Minipuls3), thereafter. The measurements
were carried out in 0.01 M formic acid buffered solutions (pH 3.6)
for calcium-selective membranes and 0.01 M Tris–HCl buffered
solutions (pH 7.2) for sodium-selective membranes. The membranes were
activated by setting the excitation monochromator to 365 nm with a
0.5 nm slit width in order to minimize photobleaching during the measurement.
The emission was recorded at 650 nm. The fluorescence values for the
fully protonated and deprotonated states were obtained by adding 1
M H2SO4 and 2 M NaOH, respectively, until no
further change in signal was detected.

Simultaneous Potentiometric
and Optical Measurements
Potentiometric measurements were
carried out using an improved version
of a previously described flow cell.15 Further
details on the measurement setup, a discussion of the improvements
over the previous version, and a schematic representation of the flow
cell are provided in the Supporting Information.

Results and Discussion
In Figure 2 the optical response of calcium-selective
(Figure 2a) and sodium-selective (Figure 2b) membranes to changes in the concentration of
the respective primary ions is shown. The membranes were first activated
by illuminating at 365 nm, and once the signal was stable, the flow
cell was flushed alternatingly with solutions containing 10–4 and 10–3 M Ca2+ (five cycles, 120 s
per step, pH 4.0). The recorded emission at 650 nm is a measure for
the protonation degree of Mc, where Mc emits more strongly than McH+. The reversible change of the intensity suggests that the
membrane in the on state seems to work as a conventional ion-selective
bulk optode. Afterward, the wavelength of the illumination source
was changed to 410 nm, which pushes the Mc form toward the Sp form,
but still allows for the measurement of the fluorescence emission
of Mc. The membranes returned to the off state (Mc → Sp), and
there was practically no response toward changing calcium concentrations.
The same was true for a sodium-selective membrane, as shown in Figure 2b (pH 7.0). The slightly longer response time of
this membrane revealed an increased membrane thickness resulting from
the differences in cocktail composition, mainly the use of tetrahydrofuran
instead of cyclohexanone as casting solvent.

Figure 2 Comparison of the sensor
response of a MOCa (a) and a MONa membrane
(b) to two different analyte concentrations when activated with 365
nm light (“on” state) and under illumination with 410
nm light (“off” state). Both examples show clearly that
there is no measurable response in the “off” state while
the activated sensor responds to a change in analyte concentration
as expected for a conventional ion-selective bulk optode.

These plots also reveal the small but nevertheless
significant
drift of the signal over time. We tried to minimize the light intensity
during interrogation in order to minimize photobleaching of the Sp;
however, this also required more time for sensor activation. For the
final application, which includes the intracellular delivery of small
ionic species, the light density will be much higher due to the focusing
of high-power light sources such as lasers onto a small sample volume.
Ultimately, the optimum light intensity will depend on the specific
requirements of an experiment, especially considering long-term stability
and speed of action.

The time required for switching the sensor
obviously depends on
the illumination intensity. Increasing the light intensity 70 times
compared to the intensity used for the measurements in Figure 2 reduced the switching times to 15 s for the on
state and 60 s for off (see inset, Figure 3). On the downside, this also increases the effect of photobleaching.
Twenty-two full switching cycles under these conditions reduced the
luminescence intensity by approximately 40%. For this study of selectivity
and ion-exchanging properties, the photostability was not a major
issue due to the conversion of the output signal to protonation degree
for quantitative evaluation. For delivery systems with sufficient
photostability for medium to long-term studies, however, a photoactive
compound with increased photostability would be desirable. This issue
is currently under investigation in our laboratory.

Figure 3 Repeated cycles of activation
(15 s, λex = 365
nm) and deactivation (60 s, λex = 410 nm). While
the time for activation under these conditions is relatively fast,
it is clearly visible that the 22 cycles for full activation and deactivation
result in significant signal loss of about 40%.

In order to get a better understanding of the processes involved
during the phototriggered pKa change of
a chromoionophore inside a cation-selective bulk optode, we characterize
membranes with compositions common for calcium-selective optodes.
The response of such a calcium-selective optode membrane (MOCa) toward
changing concentrations of Ca2+ and the interfering ions
Mg2+, K+, and Na+ is shown in Figure 4. The slow but significant photobleaching during
the time required for calibration made it necessary to perform a simple
baseline correction of the measured signal. The signal represents
the emission intensity at 650 nm after activating the sensor at 365
nm and subtracting the baseline. Magnesium ions started to interfere
at 0.25 mM, while sodium and potassium were unable to compete with
protons bound to the indicator dye throughout the tested range.

Figure 4 Response of
a calcium-selective optode in the activated state toward
different concentrations of analyte and interfering ions. The signal
is the luminescence emission measured at 650 nm under constant illumination
of the sensor with light of 365 nm.

The actual position of the baseline does not affect the calibration
because the emission intensity is transformed to values for the protonation
degree 1 – α. After measuring the values for Fmin and Fmax, which
are the fluorescence emission of fully protonated (McH+) and fully deprotonated (Mc) spiropyran, respectively, the protonation
degree 1 – α was calculated using the relationship 1  where F is the emission intensity
at 650 nm at a given analyte concentration.

Assuming that the
concentration of interfering ions is negligible,
the optode response can be described with the following general equilibrium:  where L represents the ionophore,
HInd and
Ind are the concentration of protonated and deprotonated indicator, z is the charge of the ion of interest, and n is the complex stoichiometry. The exchange constant for this equilibrium
is given by 2  where values in square
brackets represent
the concentrations in the membrane and aH+ and aIZ+ are the activities of protons and analyte ions in the
contacting sample solution. From eq 2 the optode
response function for the activity of the primary ion can be derived
using mass and charge balances and the protonation degree of the indicator
(see the Supporting Information for details): 3  where LT, RT, and IndT are the total
molar concentrations
of ionophore, ion exchanger, and indicator in the membrane. Plotting
the values for 1 – α versus the logarithmic activity
of the sample solution log aIz+ resulted in the calibration plot shown in Figure 5. Small differences in the pH values were corrected
by normalizing to pH 3.6 according to Lerchi et al.10 Fitting the data with the optode response function resulted
in the values for log KexchILn of −0.7
± 0.1 (n = 3) for Ca2+ and −5.1
± 0.1 (n = 2) for Mg2+. The complex
stoichiometries were assumed to be 3 for calcium and 2 for magnesium.31,32

Figure 5 Calibration
curves of a photoactivated calcium-selective optode.
Sodium and potassium did not give a measurable response.

Finally, the selectivity log KIJopt(SSM)
can be calculated according
to Bakker et al.2 (Supporting Information). The value was calculated for 1 –
α = 0.5 and resulted in a log KCa,Mgopt(SSM) = −2.9
± 0.2. This means that calcium will be preferred over magnesium
by roughly 3 orders of magnitude. This is an important fact for the
selectivity of the release in a biological system. A high selectivity
ensures that, for instance, calcium-loaded particles cannot exchange
their load with magnesium during particle delivery even when being
exposed to cell compartments with higher magnesium concentrations.
Only the phototriggered pKa change of
the indicator will allow the exchange of protons for calcium ions.
The selectivity over potassium and sodium is even better with log KIJopt(SSM) smaller than −8.9 for potassium and −6.6 for
sodium.

Employing the indicator as the photoactive compound
instead of
the ionophore has the big advantage that the tedious development,
optimization, and characterization of a photoactive substance only
needs to be done once. Afterward, one and the same compound can be
used to implement all kinds of different ion extraction/release systems
by simply changing the ionophore and/or ion exchanger. As a demonstration
of this concept we prepared a membrane containing the same amount
of Sp but instead of Ca-ionophore IV we included Na-ionophore X. The
data of the separate solution method for this membrane is shown in
Figure 6 and demonstrates that the film can
now be loaded with sodium with a high selectivity over potassium,
magnesium, and calcium ions. The values for log KIJopt(SSM)
with sodium as the primary ion are −2.4, −4.0, and −4.1
for potassium, calcium, and magnesium, respectively. While the sodium
selectivity of such a photorelease system over calcium and magnesium
is sufficient considering normal intracellular concentration levels,
the potassium/sodium ratio inside cells is probably too high to completely
suppress premature sodium release due to exchange with potassium using
Na-ionophore X. This may be solved by using an ionophore with a higher
selectivity, such as a 1,3-bridged calix[4]arene derivative described
in the literature.33,34

Figure 6 Calibration curves of a photodynamic,
sodium-selective optode membrane.

As shown in Figure 2, the MOCa and
MONa
membranes can be switched on and off depending on the wavelength of
the light used for illumination. Although the membranes in the on
mode responded as expected to changing analyte concentrations, the
optical experiment is no proof for the absence of exchange between
protons and analyte ions in the off state. The reason for this is
the spectral similarity of spiropyran in the protonated SpH+ and the deprotonated Sp form.15 In other
words, even if a change in calcium or proton concentration would change
the protonation degree of Sp, the change would be invisible. For this
reason we had to rely on a different method to substantiate that the
photoresponsive membrane in the off state does not permit ion exchange
between protons and analyte ions. On the basis of our previous experience,
we decided for potentiometry as the method of choice. We prepared
membranes containing Sp, Ca-ionophore IV, and NaTFPB and characterized
their potential response to pH at different calcium background concentrations
in both off and on states. The results in Figure 7 show that below a certain pH the membrane in the on state
starts to exchange protons with the contacting sample solution, resulting
in a Nernstian response toward proton activity. In the off state,
there is no response to a changing proton concentration throughout
the tested range, which indeed suggests that protons cannot compete
with Ca2+ ions due to insufficient affinity of Sp for protons.
Above the critical pH, neither Mc nor Sp is protonated and the MPCa
membrane behaves as a regular ion-selective electrode membrane by
showing a Nernstian response for calcium. In the on state, a selectivity
of log KH+,Ca2+pot = −3.5 ±
0.1 was calculated by fitting eq 4 with a fixed
theoretical slope of 58.1 mV per decade:2 4  

Figure 7 Potentiometric
response of a calcium-selective membrane (MPCa)
to changing proton and calcium activities in on and off state.

The raw data of the combined optical–electrochemical
measurement
shown in Figure 8 gives some insight in the
complexity of the processes involved in these measurements. The sequence
of events during the calibration can be summarized in the following
way (see the inset in Figure 8): (1) solution
flow through the cell is stopped (“PUMP OFF”), (2) begin
of illumination at 365 nm (“UV”), (3) change of wavelength
to 410 nm (“VIS”), and (4) start of flow through sample
compartment with next sample solution (“PUMP ON”). When
the EMF response (upper plots) and the luminescence emission at 650
nm (lower plot) are compared, it is obvious that only the membrane
potential is significantly affected by the changes in pH and aCa2+. This is expected because the
ion-exchanger concentration is lower than the concentration of indicator
dye, and therefore, even at very low pH the permselectivity of the
membrane prohibits a protonation degree higher than 10%. On the other
hand, it is surprising that there seems to be almost no photobleaching
present in this membrane, especially because the illumination was
carried out at maximally opened excitation slits in order to achieve
fast on/off cycles. This can be explained by the increased thickness
of the membrane, which has two different effects. First, the increased
volume of the membrane may act as a reservoir of dye. This means that
a concentration gradient of dye caused by bleaching will be partly
compensated by diffusion of dye from the backside of the membrane
or nonilluminated regions. Second, a decrease of the Mc concentration
close to the front side of the membrane will expose deeper lying layers
of the membrane for illumination because the Mc form has a higher
absorption coefficient at 365 nm than the Sp form, and once it is
gone, the excitation light can penetrate deeper into the membrane.
The dynamics of the EMF signal also gives a hint that these diffusion
processes and concentrations gradients inside the membrane may result
in pH and analyte activity dependent surface effects. A close comparison
of the EMF curves for pH 8.9 and 3.0 at 10–4 M Ca2+ indicates that the speed of both activation (365 nm) and
relaxation (410 nm) are faster at lower pH in the contacting solution
on the front side of the membrane. Interestingly, at pH 3, the visible
light illumination even leads to an “overshooting” of
the potential change which then returns to the baseline. This clearly
indicates that dynamic processes occur in the membrane and the system
cannot strictly be regarded as a totally equilibrated system.

Figure 8 Comparison
of the potentiometric response with the luminescence
of Mc vs time. While the potentiometric signal is influenced by both
the pH and calcium concentration in the test solution, the luminescence
signal demonstrates that the bulk of the membrane is only affected
by the illumination but not the conditions in the contacting solutions.

A further indication of this nonequilibrium
state is the deviation
of the experimental data from the theoretical response function for
protons as primary ions and divalent interfering ions in the intermediate
region between calcium and proton selectivity (see Figure 7).2

Finally, it
is also possible to calculate a value for log KIJpot by using the
values for Kexch obtained
from the optical selectivity measurements using the following equation:2 5  where the notations
in parentheses, i.e.,
(H+) or (Ca2+), mean that these values are acquired
under conditions where only the denoted ion can enter the membrane,
i.e., the regions showing Nernstian response toward the respective
ions. The final equation for log KIJpot can be derived as described
in the Supporting Information. The resulting
value of log KIJpot(from opt) = −2.5 is significantly
different from the value obtained from the potentiometric measurement
(log KIJpot(from EMF) = −3.5). Although there is a difference
in ionic strength of the contacting solution by a factor of more than
3, this cannot explain the deviation sufficiently. A possible explanation
is the difference in membrane composition: in the equilibrium state
at 1 – α = 0.5 the ratio of free ionophore to complex
bound ionophore is 3:1 in the MOCa membrane, whereas it is 1:1 in
the Nernstian response region of the MPCa membrane. Moreover, there
is a massive difference in the total concentration of the compounds
in the membranes, i.e., 12:1 for R and 10:1 for L, respectively (MOCa
to MPCa). A subtle change in the equilibrium state between the two
experimental cases is therefore possible and may explain the difference
in membrane selectivity.

In order to demonstrate a simple example
for rapid naked eye detection
of calcium with a switchable sensor (Figure 9), we prepared a 3 × 4 array of spots with two different kinds
of cocktails. Cocktail A contained 0.02 mol kg–1 Sp, 0.024 mol kg–1 NaTFPB, and 0.06 mol kg–1 Ca-ionophore IV in bis(2-ethylhexyl) sebacate (DOS),
whereas cocktail B missed the ionophore but was otherwise the same.
One microliter of the cocktail solutions per spot was transferred
to a dry filter paper. Afterward, the paper was soaked in Milli-Q
purified water. The sensor spots in the original, inactive state are
colorless (Figure 9, picture 1). After activation
of the optical sensor spots using a low-cost, 375 nm LED, a faint
yellow color in all spots became visible, indicating the presence
of McH+ (Figure 9, picture 2). After
changing the calcium concentration in the contacting solution from
0 to 10–3 M (Figure 9, picture
3), sensor spots containing the ionophore (cocktail A) changed their
color from yellow to purple, while the spots without ionophore stayed
yellow (Figure 9, picture 4). This means that
Ca2+ entered the cocktail droplets “A”, bound
to the ionophore and, at the same time, pushed protons out (McH+ → Mc). In contrast, spots “B” did not
allow the exchange of protons with Ca2+, and therefore,
McH+ persisted. Swiping a beam of a low-cost, 405 nm laser
pointer over the two center columns (Figure 9, picture 5) instantly discolored the illuminated spots, indicating
the switch from Mc/McH+ to Sp (Figure 9, picture 6). Illumination with the 375 nm LED (Figure 9, picture 7) restored the purple and faint yellow
color of the previously deactivated spots, demonstrating that the
laser did not bleach the points but deactivated the photoactive compound
in a reversible way as outlined in Scheme 1. This is a simple example of how the current system allows for the
spatially confined, reversible, and rapid switching of photodynamic
sensors. Moreover, low-cost equipment, such as LED and conventional
laser pointers, deliver sufficient energy for initiating the reaction.

from a movie demonstrating the reversible switching
of optical sensor spots selective for calcium (A) or protons only
(B). Switching was carried out with a 375 nm LED (ON) and a 405 nm
laser pointer (OFF).

Conclusions
Photoresponsive ion extraction/release systems
are valuable tools
for realizing chemical perturbations of biological species confined
in time and space. The thorough study of PRIONERS selective for calcium
and sodium ions using both optical and optoelectrochemical methods
elucidated the complex dynamic processes involved in such a triggered
ion exchange. We were able to demonstrate the selective, triggered
exchange of specific ions with the contacting sample solution. The
selectivity of both types of PRIONERS was characterized. Finally,
we were able to show an illustrative example of how a rapid and simple
activation of PRIONERS as sensors can be achieved using low-cost light
sources such as laser pointers and LEDs.
