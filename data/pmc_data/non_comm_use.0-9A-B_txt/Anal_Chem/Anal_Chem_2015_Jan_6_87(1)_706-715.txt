A current challenge in metabolomics
is the reliable quantitation
of many metabolites. Limited resolution and sensitivity combined with
the challenges associated with unknown metabolite identification have
restricted both the number and the quantitative accuracy of blood
metabolites. Focused on alleviating this bottleneck in NMR-based metabolomics,
investigations of pooled human serum combining an array of 1D/2D NMR
experiments at 800 MHz, database searches, and spiking with authentic
compounds enabled the identification of 67 blood metabolites. Many
of these (∼1/3) are new compared with those reported previously
as a part of the Human Serum Metabolome Database. In addition, considering
both the high reproducibility and quantitative nature of NMR as well
as the sensitivity of NMR chemical shifts to altered sample conditions,
experimental protocols and comprehensive peak annotations are provided
here as a guide for identification and quantitation of the new pool
of blood metabolites for routine applications. Further, investigations
focused on the evaluation of quantitation using organic solvents revealed
a surprisingly poor performance for protein precipitation using acetonitrile.
One-third of the detected metabolites were attenuated by 10–67%
compared with methanol precipitation at the same solvent-to-serum
ratio of 2:1 (v/v). Nearly 2/3 of the metabolites were further attenuated
by up to 65% upon increasing the acetonitrile-to-serum ratio to 4:1
(v/v). These results, combined with the newly established identity
for many unknown metabolites in the NMR spectrum, offer new avenues
for human serum/plasma-based metabolomics. Further, the ability to
quantitatively evaluate nearly 70 blood metabolites that represent
numerous classes, including amino acids, organic acids, carbohydrates,
and heterocyclic compounds, using a simple and highly reproducible
analytical method such as NMR may potentially guide the evaluation
of samples for analysis using mass spectrometry.

==== Body
Metabolite
profiling of human
serum/plasma is of major interest for the investigation of virtually
all human diseases.1−3 This interest stems from the clinical relevance of
blood arising from its close association (directly or indirectly)
with essentially every living cell in the human body combined with
its relatively easy access for investigations. Nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy is one of the two most widely used analytical techniques
to analyze blood metabolites, the other being mass spectrometry (MS).
Metabolite profiling of serum/plasma is generally met with two major
challenges: first, the need to alleviate interference from the massive
amount of serum/plasma proteins (6-8 g/dL); and, second,
the need to unravel the inherent complexity of the mixture of compounds
in the biofluid to reliably detect, identify and quantitate metabolites
individually. To attempt to alleviate these challenges, MS employs
protein precipitation and liquid or gas chromatography prior to detection.
However, neither protein precipitation nor chromatography is generally
deployed in NMR analysis; traditionally, intact serum/plasma is used
in the analysis using 1D NMR, in which protein signals are suppressed
using the CPMG sequence.1 Although analysis
of intact serum/plasma is attractive, numerous limitations increasingly
make this approach less suitable for metabolomics studies. In particular,
(1) the number of metabolites detected using intact serum/plasma is
restricted to ∼30 or less, which is far fewer compared with
the actual number of blood metabolites;2 (2) concentrations of many detected metabolites are grossly underestimated
as a result of attenuation caused by metabolite binding to serum/plasma
proteins;4−7 (3) residual macromolecule signals in the CPMG spectra often cause
a distorted spectral baseline, which deleteriously affects metabolite
quantitation; and (4) the copious proteins present in serum/plasma
cause reduced transverse relaxation (T2) times for metabolite signals and facilitate exchange between protein-bound
and free metabolites, which together result in significantly broadened
NMR peaks and poor quantitative accuracy.

Efforts focused on
alleviating these bottlenecks have included
physically removing serum/plasma proteins using ultrafiltration; solid
phase extraction; or protein precipitation using an organic solvent,
such as methanol, acetonitrile, acetone, perchloric acid or trichloroacetic
acid.8−11 These approaches have been shown to achieve significant improvements
in the number of metabolites identified in blood. Notably, a comprehensive
analysis of ultrafiltered serum, as a part of investigations of the
human serum metabolome, resulted in identification of 49 metabolites,
the number believed to be an upper limit for human serum, especially
using 1H 1D NMR.2,12 More recently, another
exhaustive study of ultrafiltered human plasma focused on the global
characterization of a NIST SRM (National Institute of Standards and
Technology Standard Reference Material) identified a total of 39 metabolites.13 Incidentally, two studies from the same group
involving applications to colorectal cancer14 and pancreatic cancer,15 presumably using
ultrafiltered serum, report identification of 55 and 58 metabolites,
respectively; however, the lack of pertinent experimental and NMR
spectral analysis details makes these studies difficult for translation
to more routine applications. Further, both studies utilized Chenomx
software,16 which often provides numerous
hits in the identification of unknown metabolites and, hence, can
lead to incorrect metabolite identification, especially for low-concentration
(∼1 μM) metabolites.

To make further progress in
NMR-based metabolomics, there is a
strong need to enhance the number of identified metabolites, provide
experimental details to allow easy reproduction of spectra, and establish
spectral assignment/analysis protocols for unambiguous metabolite
identification. Establishment of a robust workflow will facilitate
translation of the approach for routine use, particularly given the
highly reproducible and quantitative nature of NMR. The current study
is focused on enhancing the pool of quantifiable metabolites in blood
using a protein precipitation approach that we recently showed has
superior performance over ultrafiltration for blood metabolite quantitation.7 In the current work, comprehensive analyses of
a pooled human serum were made combining an array of 1D and 2D NMR
experiments, database searches, and spiking experiments using authentic
compounds to achieve this goal, resulting in 67 quantified metabolites
(including two beta sugars). Importantly, apart from identifying a
new pool of blood metabolites, detailed experimental protocols and
exhaustive peak labeling, especially for characteristic metabolite
peaks, are provided to enable easy reproduction of serum spectra,
reliable metabolite identification and quantitation. Further, investigations
based on the absolute concentrations of identified metabolites reveal
a surprisingly poor performance for protein precipitation using acetonitrile
compared with methanol, an important outcome that contradicts commonly
held opinion that acetonitrile performs better as a serum protein
precipitation solvent in metabolomics studies.

Materials and Methods
Methanol, acetonitrile, sodium phosphate, monobasic (NaH2PO4), sodium phosphate, dibasic (Na2HPO4), and 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic acid-2,2,3,3-d4 sodium salt (TSP) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO). Sixty-five standard compounds used for spiking to confirm
peak assignments were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, except for 3-hydroxyisovaleric
acid, which was obtained from Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA) (Supporting Information (SI) Table S1). Deuterium
oxide (D2O) was obtained from Cambridge Isotope laboratories,
Inc. (Andover, MA). Pooled human serum was obtained from Innovative
Research, Inc. (Novi, MI). Deionized (DI) water was purified using
an in-house Synergy Ultrapure Water System from Millipore (Billerica,
MA). All chemicals were used with no further purification.

Preparation
of Phosphate Buffer
Buffer solution was
prepared by dissolving 928.6 mg of anhydrous NaH2PO4 and 320.9 mg of anhydrous Na2HPO4 in
100 g of D2O and used without further pH correction.

Solutions
of Authentic Compounds for Spiking Experiments
Stock solutions
(1 mL; 1 mM) for all 65 compounds (see SI Table S1) were prepared, separately, in D2O by diluting
their 50 mM stock solutions, which were first
prepared by weighing the compounds and dissolving in D2O solvent.

Serum Protein Precipitation Using Methanol
Sixteen
300 μL serum samples were mixed with methanol in 1:1, 1:2, 1:3
or 1:4 ratios (v/v) (see SI Table S2),
vortexed, and incubated at −20 °C for 20 min. The mixtures
were centrifuged at 13 400 rcf for 30 min to pellet proteins.
Supernatants were decanted to fresh vials and dried. The dried samples
were mixed with 100 μL of phosphate buffer in D2O
containing 66.17 μM TSP, made up to 600 μL with phosphate
buffer in D2O, and transferred to 5 mm NMR tubes.

Serum
Protein Precipitation Using Acetonitrile
Sixteen
300 μL serum samples were mixed with acetonitrile in 1:1, 1:2,
1:3 or 1:4 ratios (v/v) (see SI Table S2),
vortexed, and incubated at −20 °C for 20 min. The mixtures
were centrifuged at 13 400 rcf for 30 min to pellet proteins.
Supernatants were decanted to fresh vials and dried. The dried samples
were mixed with 100 μL of a solution of phosphate buffer in
D2O containing 66.17 μM TSP, made up to 600 μL
with phosphate buffer in D2O, and transferred to 5 mm NMR
tubes.

Ultrafiltration
Centrifugal filters (3 kDa cutoff;
Amicon Microcon, YM-3; Sigma-Aldrich) were washed with water and centrifuged
thrice with 300 μL of water at 13 400 rcf for 20 min,
each time. Two 300 μL serum samples were then transferred to
filter tubes and centrifuged for 20 min at 13 400 rcf. The
filtrates were mixed separately with a 100 μL solution of phosphate
buffer in D2O containing 66.17 μM TSP. The solutions
were made up to 600 μL with the phosphate buffer in D2O and transferred to 5 mm NMR tubes.

NMR Spectroscopy
All NMR experiments were performed
at 298 K on a Bruker Avance III 800 MHz spectrometer equipped with
a cryogenically cooled probe and Z-gradients suitable for inverse
detection. A few spiking experiments were performed on a Bruker 700
MHz spectrometer equipped with a room temperature probe and Z-gradients
suitable for inverse detection. The one-pulse or NOESY pulse sequence
along with the CPMG (Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill)
pulse sequence, all with water suppression using presaturation, were
used for 1H 1D NMR experiments. To confirm unknown metabolite
identification, spectra were obtained after each addition of 5–10
μL of stock solution (1 mM) of the authentic compounds to the
methanol-precipitated (2:1 v/v) serum samples (see SI Table S1); in the case of volatile compounds, such as acetone,
ethanol, 2-butanol, dimethylamine, and urea, spiking experiments were
performed using ultrafiltered serum samples. To enable comparison
of metabolite concentrations from various protein precipitation methods
(SI Table S2), the CPMG experiments were
performed with 128 transients and a sufficiently long recycle delay
(D1 = 15 s). To aid unknown metabolite identification, homonuclear
two-dimensional (2D) experiments, such as 1H–1H double quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy (DQF-COSY)
and 1H–1H total correlation spectroscopy
(TOCSY) experiments, were performed on serum samples after protein
precipitation using methanol (2:1 v/v). The 2D experiments were performed
with suppression of the residual water signal by presaturation during
the relaxation delay. For DQF-COSY and TOCSY experiments, sweep widths
of 9600 Hz were used in both dimensions; 512 or 400 FIDs were obtained
with t1 increments for DQF-COSY or TOCSY,
respectively, each with 2048 complex data points. The number of transients
used was 16, and the relaxation delay was 2.0 s for DQF-COSY and 1.5
s for TOCSY. The resulting 2D data were zero-filled to 1024 points
in the t1 dimension. A 90° shifted
squared sine-bell window function was applied to both dimensions before
Fourier transformation. Chemical shifts were referenced to the internal
TSP signal for 1H 1D or 2D spectra. Bruker Topspin versions
3.0 or 3.1 software packages were used for NMR data acquisition, processing,
and analyses.

Peak Assignment, Unknown Metabolite Identification and Metabolite
Quantitation
Initial peak assignments relied on established
literature values, specifically, the human metabolome database,17 the biological magnetic resonance data bank,18 and publications from our laboratory on the
serum metabolome.7,19 Unknown metabolite identification
involved a combination of literature/database searches,17 chemical shift, peak multiplicity, and J couplings measurements, and comprehensive 2D DQF-COSY
and TOCSY spectral analyses. The putative new compounds were finally
confirmed by spiking with authentic compounds (see SI Table S1). Chenomx NMR Suite Professional Software package
(version 5.1; Chenomx Inc., Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) was used to
quantitate the metabolites. This software allows fitting spectral
lines using the standard metabolite library for 800 MHz 1H NMR spectra and, in particular, the determination of concentrations
in complicated, overlapped spectral regions. One complication that
arises is that the proximity of chemical shift values for multiple
metabolite signals often result in the software providing multiple
library hits for the same metabolite peak; the correct metabolite
identification therefore relied on the newly established metabolite
identification as annotated for a typical 1H NMR spectrum
(vide infra). Peak-fitting with reference to the internal TSP signal
enabled the determination of absolute concentrations for identified
metabolites in protein-precipitated serum except for 2-oxoisovaleric,
which was absent in the Chenomx library and was therefore quantitated
by manual integration using the Bruker Topspin versions 3.0 or 3.1
software package.

Results and Discussion
Both protein-precipitated
and ultrafiltered serum provided highly
resolved 1H NMR spectra for quantitative analysis of metabolites.
A total of 67 blood metabolites were identified on the basis of comprehensive
analyses of the NMR spectra. Importantly, more than 1/3 of the identified
metabolites are new compared with the previous comprehensive investigation,
made as a part of an analysis of human serum metabolome.2 Table 1 lists all 67 identified
metabolites with the newly identified NMR-detectable metabolites highlighted
in bold. Figures 1 and 2 show typical spectra for protein precipitated serum and ultrafiltered
serum along with the annotations for characteristic peaks for all
67 metabolites. Both anomers (α and β) for glucose as
well as mannose were distinctly identified. Six of the metabolites,
namely, acetone, ethanol, methanol, dimethylamine, 2-propanol, and
urea (see SI Table S3), were not observed
in protein precipitated serum because they are lost due to sample
drying after protein precipitation. Further, 1,2-propanediol, despite
being a liquid at room temperature with a boiling point of 187 °C,
is detected in protein precipitated serum; however, its NMR peak intensity
is attenuated due to sample drying (see Figures 1 and 2), and hence, under such circumstances,
its peak intensity underestimates its concentration in blood. In principle,
deuterated methanol could be used without drying, but this approach
would add considerable expense, and the chemical shifts would, of
course, be different.

Despite the potential of NMR-based
metabolomics of blood for the
study of human diseases, advances that rely on intact serum/plasma
analysis using CPMG sequence are met with numerous challenges, including
the limited resolution, unknown metabolite identification, and the
deleterious effects of copious proteins.20 In particular, the small number of quantifiable metabolites (∼30)
combined with the grossly attenuated metabolite concentrations7 has limited the utility of this popular NMR analysis
method and yielded more limited data compared with that obtained from
mass spectrometry. Several efforts that involve removal of serum/plasma
proteins by ultrafiltration or precipitation that show significant
improvements in the number of quantifiable metabolites have been made;2,9−11 however, these approaches lack comprehensive evaluation
for routine quantitation of blood metabolites. Thus far, many NMR
studies have used ultrafiltration because of its efficient protein
removal under the assumption that metabolites are recovered optimally.2,13−15 Only recently, on the basis of comprehensive analysis
of 44 blood metabolites utilizing a variety of protein removal methods,
we showed that protein precipitation exhibits superior performance
over ultrafiltration for quantitating blood metabolites.7 In the current study, we have used the protein
precipitation approach and identified an additional set of quantifiable
blood metabolites.

Two important aspects of the analysis of
blood metabolites by NMR
are unknown metabolite identification and unambiguous peak assignment
for routine applications. The large chemical shift databases currently
available help immensely to narrow peak assignments to a relatively
small list of metabolites. However, what remains challenging is the
unambiguous peak assignment to specific metabolites, especially for
low concentration metabolites, most of whose peaks are often buried
underneath abundant metabolite signals. Thus, although a rich metabolite
library consisting of nearly 300 compounds is available in the Chenomx
library, for example, and is helpful for unknown metabolite identification,16 the numerous hits that it gives often lead to
ambiguous or incorrect identification. The remedy for this bottleneck
is a one-time establishment of the peak identities for human blood
serum/plasma NMR spectra.

An advantage of using serum or plasma
as the sample matrix results
in stable chemical shift values that are very similar to those of
other serum/plasma samples. Since, under the given experimental conditions,
virtually identical spectra for blood serum/plasma can be obtained
and because of the highly reproducible nature of NMR, a one-time establishment
of peak assignments enables translation for routine applications.
Therefore, in addition to the information provided in Table 1, Figures 1 and 2, with annotations of the characteristic peaks useful
for integration for all 67 identified metabolites, serve as important visual guides to identify blood metabolites routinely. Once
the unambiguous identification of blood metabolites is achieved, they
can be reliably quantitated using any quantitation software package,
such as Chenomx, Mnova (http://mestrelab.com), or the one
available with any NMR instrument vendor.

Utilizing the new
and enhanced pool of blood metabolites, a comprehensive
assessment of the performance of two commonly used protein precipitation
solvents, methanol and acetonitrile, was made. The results reveal
a surprisingly poor performance for protein precipitation using acetonitrile:
nearly 1/3 of the metabolites were attenuated by 10 to 67% compared
with methanol precipitation at the same solvent-to-serum ratio of
2:1. In addition, nearly 2/3 of the metabolites were attenuated further
by up to 65% upon increasing the acetonitrile-to-serum ratio to 4:1
(Figure 3, SI Tables
S4 and S5). For a 3:1 acetonitrile-to-serum ratio, nearly 50% of the
metabolites were attenuated by up to 53%. In contrast, only formic
acid was attenuated by 10% upon increasing the methanol-to-serum ratio
from 2:1 to 3:1, although 26% of the metabolites were attenuated by
up to 33% upon increasing the methanol-to-serum ratio from 2:1 to
4:1.

As an example, SI Figure S1
illustrates
the reduction in the NMR peak intensities for two typical metabolites,
glutamic acid (50%) and threonine (39%), upon increasing the proportion
of acetonitrile; under identical conditions, no appreciable changes
in peak intensities were observed for methanol precipitation. These
results indicate that the extraction of metabolites by methanol precipitation,
apart from being more quantitative, is less susceptible to variation
caused by different amounts of methanol. Acetonitrile, on the other
hand, deleteriously affects metabolite quantities and, hence, is likely
unsuitable for quantitative analysis of blood metabolites without
employing recovery or internal standards. This is particularly important
because, due to the lack of a comprehensive evaluation of blood metabolite
quantitation, acetonitrile is still incorrectly (in our opinion) considered
to be a better solvent for serum protein precipitation in metabolomics.7 It may be noted that protein precipitation using
a 1:1 solvent-to-serum ratio retained a high level of residual proteins
compared with the 2:1 ratio for both methanol and acetonitrile, and
hence, the 1:1 ratio was not considered for further quantitative evaluation
(see SI Figures S2 and S3).

Figure 3 Comparison of absolute
concentrations (in μM) of metabolites
detected in pooled human blood serum and quantitated using 800 MHz
NMR spectroscopy after protein precipitation using methanol (MeOH)
(a, b, c, d) or acetonitrile (ACN) (e, f, g, h) at solvent-to-serum
ratios of 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1. Methanol performs most optimally over
a wide range and methanol-to-serum ratio of 2:1 provides the best
performance.

The vast differences
in metabolite recovery between methanol and
acetonitrile solvents observed in the present study may be understood
on the basis of differences in solubility of metabolites dissolved
in these two solvents. Virtually all identified and quantified metabolites
in this study are hydrophilic in nature, and hence, all are soluble
in water. However, these metabolites have more limited solubility
in organic solvents such as acetonitrile and, to a much lesser extent,
methanol. In the aqueous mixture of serum, methanol is quite hydrophilic
and recovers all water-soluble metabolites, although at higher methanol
concentrations one can see some reduced recovery. Hydrophilic metabolites
are less soluble in acetonitrile, and therefore, at the higher proportions
of this organic solvent, the metabolite recovery decreases substantially.
Studies have shown that solubility of polar metabolites decreases
significantly as the solvent is switched from water to alcohol. For
example, it has been shown that the relative solubility of amino acids
such as glycine, alanine, isoleucine, phenylalanine and asparagine
decreases as much as 3 orders of magnitude from water to pure methanol.21 The solubility for highly polar metabolites
such as histidine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and asparagine could
not even be measured in acetonitrile at a proportion greater than
∼1:2 (w/v).22 In accordance with
these results, the recovery of a number of highly polar metabolites,
including citric acid, succinic acid, lysine, aspartic acid, asparagine,
glutamine, glutamic acid, threonine, and histidine, is reduced drastically
as the proportion of acetonitrile increases (Figure 3 and SI Figure S1).

MS plays
an important role in the metabolomics analysis of blood
owing to its inherently high sensitivity and complementarity to NMR.
In MS analysis, prior protein removal from blood serum/plasma is an
important prerequisite. Considering the challenges involved in alleviating
the interference of residual proteins in MS analysis, sample processing
has been the subject of numerous investigations.20,23−29 The performance of sample processing in such MS-focused investigations
is typically evaluated using the total number of ions detected and
not on the comprehensive quantitative analysis of metabolites. Such
an evaluation limits the quantitative accuracy, as identities for
a majority of the ions thus detected remain unknown. In the current
study, we have shown that absolute concentrations for numerous classes
of metabolites, which represent amino acids, organic acids, carbohydrates,
and heterocyclic compounds, can be obtained from a simple NMR method.
Beyond metabolomics studies and applications, this ability of NMR
to quantitatively evaluate a relatively large number of metabolites
representing many important classes may also offer new avenues to
assess sample processing methods for analysis using MS.

In conclusion,
we describe the NMR identification of numerous unknown
metabolites in blood and provide a simple optimized NMR approach to
quantitate the enhanced pool of blood metabolites on a routine basis.
A one-time establishment of the identity for 67 metabolites, a significant
portion of which is newly established in this study, is made by a
comprehensive analysis of pooled human blood serum using an array
of 1D and 2D NMR techniques, database searches, and spiking experiments
using authentic compounds. An important aspect of this study is that
the characteristic peaks for all identified metabolites are marked
for easy identification and quantitation of metabolites in the NMR
spectrum. This, we believe, is critical for widespread use of enhanced
and NMR-based blood metabolite profiling because the chemical shift
databases alone are often insufficient for unambiguous assignment.
This issue is particularly acute for low-concentration metabolites,
given the peak overlap and chemical shift sensitivity to sample conditions
such as pH, salt, and temperature. The high reproducibility of NMR
combined with sample processing and analysis protocols provided here
enable obtaining identical spectra for blood serum/plasma on a routine
basis. Hence, even nonexpert NMR users can easily identify and quantify
blood metabolites following the described approach, which is important
for effective use of this tool. In addition, based on the comprehensive
analysis of the pool of metabolites established in this study, the
performance of serum protein precipitation using different proportions
of methanol or acetonitrile was evaluated. Methanol performs most
optimally over a wide range of concentrations, whereas acetonitrile
shows a surprisingly poor performance. Finally, the ability to quantitatively
detect a large number of metabolites, which represent many classes,
including amino acids, organic acids, carbohydrates, and heterocyclic
compounds, using a simple NMR method described in this study potentially
offers new avenues to assess sample processing for analysis using
MS. The raw and annotated data from this study will be made available
to the metabolomics community through major metabolomics resources,
including the Metabolomics Workbench (http://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/), MetaboLights (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/),
and the Northwest Metabolomics Research Center (http://depts.washington.edu/nwmrc/).
