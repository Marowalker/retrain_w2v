Hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX)
mass spectrometry (MS) has become
a potent technique to probe higher-order structures, dynamics, and
interactions of proteins. While the range of proteins amenable to
interrogation by HDX MS continues to expand at an accelerating pace,
there are still a few classes of proteins whose analysis with this
technique remains challenging. Disulfide-rich proteins constitute
one of such groups: since the reduction of thiol–thiol bonds
must be carried out under suboptimal conditions (to minimize the back-exchange),
it frequently results in incomplete dissociation of disulfide bridges
prior to MS analysis, leading to a loss of signal, inadequate sequence
coverage, and a dramatic increase in the difficulty of data analysis.
In this work, the dissociation of disulfide-linked peptide dimers
produced by peptic digestion of the 80 kDa glycoprotein transferrin
in the course of HDX MS experiments is carried out using electron
capture dissociation (ECD). ECD results in efficient cleavage of the
thiol–thiol bonds in the gas phase on the fast LC time scale
and allows the deuterium content of the monomeric constituents of
the peptide dimers to be measured individually. The measurements appear
to be unaffected by hydrogen scrambling, even when high collisional
energies are utilized. This technique will benefit HDX MS measurements
for any protein that contains one or more disulfides and the potential
gain in sequence coverage and spatial resolution would increase with
disulfide bond number.

Hydrogen/deuterium
exchange
(HDX) with mass spectrometry (MS) detection has evolved in the past
two decades into a powerful tool that is now used to decipher intimate
details of processes as diverse as protein folding, recognition and
binding, and enzyme catalysis.1,2 While initially being
a tool that was used exclusively in fundamental studies, HDX MS is
now becoming an indispensable part of the analytical arsenal in the
biopharmaceutical sector, where it is utilized increasingly in all
stages of protein drug development from discovery to quality control.3−5 Despite this progress, several areas remain where the application
of HDX MS has met with only limited success. Disulfide-rich proteins
constitute one such group, where characterization of higher-order
structure and dynamics is particularly difficult, because of the suboptimal
conditions used for reduction of thiol–thiol bonds following
a quench of the exchange reactions. Proteins containing disulfide
bonds are encountered very rarely in the protein folding studies where
the most popular targets are small proteins lacking cysteine residues
(with a notable exception of the oxidative folding studies), as well
as in many other fundamental studies focusing on proteins of prokaryotic
origin. However, disulfide-rich proteins are encountered very frequently
in eukaryotic proteomes6 and constitute
a large segment of the biopharmaceutical products,7 where the thiol–thiol bonds are critical elements
defining conformation of protein drugs, and also play an important
role in stabilizing proteins by endowing them with protease resistance.

While disulfide bond reduction is a relatively trivial task that
can be readily accomplished at neutral pH using a variety of reagents,
the acidic, low-temperature environment where proteins are placed
to quench HDX narrows down the choice to a single reducing agent,
TCEP.8 However, the alkaline pH for optimal
disulfide reduction by TCEP is substantially higher, compared to the
acidic environment of typical “slow exchange conditions”
commonly employed to minimize back exchange within proteins and their
peptic fragments prior to MS analysis.9 Furthermore, disulfide reduction in HDX MS measurements is usually
carried out within a relatively short period of time (a few minutes)
and at low temperature (0–4 °C) to limit the extent of
the back-exchange, which in many situations does not allow the complete
dissociation of thiol–thiol linkages of individual peptic fragments
to be achieved in solution prior to LC separation and MS analysis
of their deuterium content. Incomplete reduction of disulfide bonds
dramatically increases the pool of candidate peptides that should
be considered when analyzing proteolytic fragments in HDX MS measurements
and frequently reduces sequence coverage and/or spatial resolution.
While the former problem can be solved by employing more powerful
and robust search engines for peptide identification, the latter one
is more difficult to circumvent and can be very detrimental for the
quality of HDX MS data and may require significant changes in experimental
protocols. Indeed, a complete failure to reduce a certain disulfide
bond in a protein will give rise to a thiol–thiol linked peptide
dimer, whose constituent monomers do not necessarily represent a contiguous
segment of the protein and may have vastly different conformational
and dynamic properties. The total deuterium content of the entire
dimer (measured by HDX MS) would not provide any meaningful information
under these conditions, thereby effectively reducing the sequence
coverage in the corresponding segments of the protein.

Certain
changes in the sample work-up protocol in solution can
alleviate this problem, at least for smaller proteins,10 although it usually comes at a price of significantly
increased levels of back exchange. An alternative approach to this
problem examined in this work focuses on dissociation of disulfide-linked
dimers in the gas phase to supplement (or replace) the reduction step
in solution. Among several gas-phase ion fragmentation techniques
that are capable of inducing the disulfide bond dissociation,11,12 negative-ion collision-induced dissociation (CID)13,14 and positive-ion ECD15 (or its sister
technique, electron transfer dissociation, ETD) have a particular
appeal in that they can be implemented on most commercial instruments.
While negative-ion CID has the additional advantage to perform measurements
in a broad-band mode (without LC separation of peptic fragments),16 its utilization as a means of inducing dissociation
of disulfide bonds requires that very specific instrument types be
used due to the sensitivity of the fragmentation channels to the collision
energy. Perhaps more importantly, peptides tend to generate lower
signal in the negative-ion mode, a feature that would certainly be
detrimental to the quality of HDX MS data. In addition, it is unknown
whether the high level of amide hydrogen scrambling observed within
a model peptide under negative-ion CID17 is also possible between two peptides linked by a disulfide. Therefore,
this technique was excluded from the consideration in this work and
the focus was shifted to an electron-based fragmentation method (ECD).

The suitability of ECD as a means of enhancing sequence coverage
and spatial resolution that can be achieved in HDX MS studies of disulfide-rich
proteins was evaluated in this work using the 80 kDa glycoprotein
human serum transferrin (Tf) as a model system. Tf is a transport
protein that is considered as a potential drug carrier, because of
its unique ability to be internalized by cells in the process of endocytosis
and cross physiological barriers in the process of transcytosis;18,19 several Tf-based therapeutics are currently in development.20−22 The proven therapeutic potential of Tf—its large size and
the presence of multiple (18) disulfide bonds spread across the protein
sequence—make it an epitome of modern protein drugs.18 In this work, we used four partially overlapping
disulfide-linked peptide dimers (Tf peptic fragments) to evaluate
ECD as a tool to extract information on deuterium content of their
constituent peptide monomers and examine the influence of hydrogen
scrambling on the quality of these measurements. The results of this
study provide clear evidence that dissociation of disulfide bonds
in the gas phase by means of ECD leads to a noticeable improvement
of both sequence coverage and spatial resolution, while hydrogen scrambling
does not appear to affect the outcome of these measurements, even
when ions experience relatively high levels of collisional activation.

Materials
and Methods
Human serum transferrin (Tf) was generously provided
by Prof. A.B.
Mason (University of Vermont, College of Medicine). Porcine pepsin
and TCEP were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich Chemical Co. (St.
Louis, MO), and D2O was purchased from Cambridge Isotope
Laboratories (Cambridge, MA). All other chemicals and solvents used
in this work were of analytical grade or higher. Pepsin was immobilized
onto a Poros 20 AL (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) support matrix,
using the manufacturer suggested protocol and packed into a 2.1 ×
50 mm column. Tf was digested in the absence of reductant under HDX
quench conditions (pH 2.6, on ice) by running through the pepsin column
at a flow rate of 0.1 mL/min, using a mobile phase of 0.1% formic
acid. One hundred microliters (100 μL) of 2 μM Tf was
injected for each run. Resulting peptides were concentrated and desalted
on a peptide trap prior to their separation via reverse-phase HPLC
(Agilent 1100 HPLC system) using a Jupiter 4 μm Proteo 90 Å
2 × 50 mm column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). HDX data were acquired
using a rapid elution gradient (5–50% AcN in 0.1% formic acid
in 5 min at 0.2 mL/min), whereas longer elution gradients (5–50%
in 45 min) were utilized for peptide mapping purposes. Identification
of the disulfide linked peptides was aided by liquid chromatography–tandem
mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) analysis of a set of peptides in which
the cysteine thiol groups had been reduced and alkylated post-digestion.
HDX was initiated by dilution into D2O buffer (50 mM sodium
phosphate pH 7.2) at 37 °C with a final H:D ratio of 1:10. All
measurements were made on a solariX 7 Tesla Fourier-transform ion
cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica,
MA) with a quadrupole front end. Precursor ions were mass-selected
in the quadrupole filter using an isolation window of 10 m/z units and an accumulation time of 0.25 s. Peptides
transmitted to the ICR cell were fragmented by electron capture dissociation
(ECD), using a pulse length of 0.1 s and pulse bias of 1.0. Data were
processed using DataAnalysis 4.0 (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA),
which allowed averaging of several adjacent ECD scans (typically 3–5
during HDX data acquisition) resulting from the same precursor ion.
End-point samples were prepared by performing the exchange under acid
denaturing conditions (in 0.88% formic acid) at 37 °C for 1 h
and then adjusting the pH to 2.6 prior to digestion and analysis.
Back exchange rates for the four peptides discussed in detail in this
text varied from 25 to 32%, within the range typically observed with
our setup (5–40%).

Results and Discussion
Peptic digestion
of Tf under HDX quench conditions that include
a short incubation in a high concentration of TCEP produces a peptide
map with poor coverage of Cys containing residues (Figure 1 in the Supporting Information). Of the 38 Cys residues
in Tf, we are able to consistently detect less than one-fifth in their
reduced form. Extending the preincubation to 10 min resulted in a
modest improvement in the intensity of these seven peptides; however,
we were not able to increase the number of free Cys detected. Peptic
digestion of Tf under HDX quench conditions in the absence of reductant
typically generates ∼340 peptide fragments of sufficient intensity
for reliable HDX measurements. This number of peptides dramatically
increases to 820 after extensive reduction of the sample with TCEP
prior to LC-MS analysis, with 110 peptides being common to both datasets.
While the peptides present in both reduced and nonreduced samples
derive from protein segments that do not contain cysteine, the nonoverlapping
part of the two sets represents disulfide-linked peptide dimers and
higher multimers, as well as monomers with internal disulfides. Identification
of these peptides is not a trivial task, because of the low specificity
of protein hydrolysis by pepsin, which (coupled with the heterogeneity
of the two carbohydrate chains and the possibility of having partial
reduction of disulfides within cysteine-rich segments of the protein)
leads an astronomically high number of “candidate” peptides.
Matching up their calculated masses against the set of the measured
masses requires computerized tools beyond what is typically offered
by standard search engines. In our work, we identified candidate disulfide
containing peptides by focusing on a pool of highly abundant peptic
fragments unique to the nonreduced sample. Among these, disulfide
linked peptides were readily identified by ECD using a long elution
gradient and visually scanning the data for parent ions producing
few dominant fragments.

This procedure is illustrated in Figure 1, where several related peptide dimers are identified
by subjecting
corresponding ions to ECD in the ICR cell. While numerous low-abundance
fragments can be detected in each case, the two most prominent fragments
consistently correspond to the dissociation of the external disulfide
bond linking the two monomeric units. All four dimers share one monomeric
unit, represented by the Val396–Leu408 segment of the protein (“peptide 1” in Figure 1), while the second monomeric unit (“peptide
2” in Figure 1) corresponds to segments
of varying length within Leu671–Pro679. While enhancing sequence coverage, the promiscuous sequence specificity
of pepsin can also reduce peptide ion abundance in regions such as
Leu671–Pro679, where multiple overlapping
fragments are generated. Further loss in intensity would be caused
by incomplete reduction of disulfides within such a region. This explains
why peptide Val396–Leu408, common to
the four disulfide linked peptides in Figure 1, was detected under reducing quench conditions (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), whereas the linked
counterparts containing residue Cys674 were not. An added benefit
to utilizing disulfide linked peptides is the potential to detect
small hydrophilic fragments not readily retained by RPLC in their
reduced form. Complete chromatographic separation of the four example
peptide dimers is problematic, even with the longer elution gradient
used for peptide mapping in Figure 1 and overlapping
elution profiles were observed for the rapid gradient of HDX MS measurements.
Nevertheless, high efficiency of disulfide cleavages with ECD allows
reproducible isotopic distributions to be obtained for each monomeric
constituent with the quality that is more than adequate for HDX MS
measurements. We chose these four disulfide-linked peptides as a model
to evaluate the application of gas-phase disulfide cleavage in the
HDX MS scheme; data for several other disulfide-linked peptides readily
identified from the same sample are shown in the Supporting Information (Figures S2–S5). While all disulfide-linked
species identified in the Tf peptic digest are currently limited to
dimers (largely from their relative ease of identification), we have
observed facile cleavage of disulfides in a linked peptide trimer
and believe separation of even higher multimers is possible, perhaps
at a reduced efficiency. Based on our observations, we find ECD effective
at separating peptides linked by a single disulfide, while the efficiency
of cleaving multiple disulfide bonds connecting two peptides remains
to be evaluated.

Figure 1 Identification of disulfide-linked peptide dimers by LC/MS/MS.
The top diagram shows the total ion chromatograms (TIC) of the peptic
fragments derived from Tf digested under conditions identical to those
used in HDX MS experiments. The large TIC corresponds to the long
elution gradient used to enhance separation of proteolytic fragments
and identify the highest possible number of peptides and to increase
the time window for MS/MS measurements. The smaller TIC inset above
is an example TIC generated during HDX MS/MS data collection. Panels
labeled A–D illustrate the identification of disulfide-linked
peptide dimers by observing distinct peptide monomers following fragmentation
of a precursor ion with ECD (extracted ion chromatograms for these
four peptide dimers are indicated by corresponding letters A–D
in both upper TIC traces).

HDX MS data obtained at the entire peptide dimer level for
each
of the four peptic fragments listed above (column labeled “MS1”
in Figure 2) reflects the exchange averaged
out across both constituents of the dimer. Since these monomeric units
are noncontiguous in the protein sequence and, in fact, are located
within very different structural elements of the protein, the averaged
exchange data are not particularly meaningful. Although one can easily
plot the time course of deuterium uptake for each of the dimer (black
curves in the far right column in Figure 2),
each curve is a convolution of contributions from two distinct parts.
Therefore, it is not clear, for example, if the intermediate level
of deuterium uptake exhibited by the peptide dimer (Val396–Leu408)/(Leu671–Pro679) is a result of averaging out vastly different protection levels
of the two monomers, or if the deuterium label is indeed distributed
uniformly between the two monomers. The monotonically increasing overall
protection within the series of the four dimers following the shortening
of “peptide 2” does suggest that, in this particular
case, one of the monomeric units (Val396–Leu408) is largely protected, while the other one has a significantly
more dynamic character. Nevertheless, quantitative conclusions regarding
the protection of each monomer are impossible to make, since even
in the case of the shortest “peptide 2” (Glu672–Thr675, see the bottom diagram in Figure 2) the overall protection of the dimer is ca. 20%,
which leaves the following possible protection ranges for its constituent
monomers: 0 to 25% for “peptide 1” and 0 to 93% for
“peptide 2.”

Figure 2 HDX MS and HDX MS/MS data for the four overlapping
peptide dimers
(structures are shown in the left column). The “MS1”
column illustrates HDX MS measurements for each dimer (top trace:
isotopic distribution of an unlabeled peptide ion, middle trace: isotopic
distribution of the peptide following 1 min of exchange in solution,
and bottom trace: end-point of the exchange reaction). The two “MS2”
columns illustrate HDX MS/MS data for each monomeric constituent of
the peptide dimer (“Pep 1” and “Pep 2”).
The far right column shows kinetic plots for HDX MS (black trace)
and HDX MS/MS (blue and red) measurements.

Inclusion of ECD in the HDX MS workflow as a means of separating
the monomeric constituents of the disulfide-linked peptide dimers
allows the deuterium content of each monomer to be measured individually.
The results of these measurements are shown in the second and third
columns of Figure 2. Despite the significant
variation in the deuterium uptake levels exhibited by the intact peptide
dimers, the isotopic distributions of “peptide 1” at
each time point are very similar for all four precursor ions, and
the slight variation is due to the different location of the exchange
end points within this set. Once the end point variation is taken
into account, the protection levels of “peptide 1” derived
from different precursors become indistinguishable from each other
within the experimental error (see the blue curves in Figure 2, far right column).

On the other hand, deuterium
levels of “peptide 2”
extracted from different precursor ions exhibit very significant variation:
as the length of this segment is reduced from nine amino acid residues
(Leu671–Pro679) to four (Glu672–Thr675), the relative deuterium uptake levels
drop more than 3-fold (from nearly 80% for the longest peptide to
20% for the shortest, see the blue curves in Figure 2, far right column). This behavior is fully consistent with
the observed variation in the deuterium protection within the set
of four intact peptide dimers: as the protection level of the monomer
with the fixed length (Val396–Leu408)
remains constant within this set, increasing size of the second monomeric
unit leads to its more dynamic character (via addition of amino acid
residues exhibiting very low levels of amide protection), causing
the overall protection at the dimer level to decrease.

The contrast
between the exchange behavior of “peptide 1”
extracted from four different dimer peptides and that of “peptide
2” is dramatic, but hardly surprising. Indeed, should the protection
level of “peptide 1” be sensitive to the choice of a
precursor ion, it would have clearly signaled that hydrogen scrambling
is taking place. At the same time, the observed correlation between
the length of “peptide 2” and the rate of deuterium
uptake is noteworthy, as this variation must be attributed only to
the vastly different exchange kinetics in solution exhibited by smaller
segments and indeed single amino acid residues within (Leu671–Pro679). Locations of both Val396–Leu408 (protein segment corresponding to “peptide 1”)
and Leu671–Pro679 (the largest segment
within the set of “peptide 2”) within Tf are shown in
Figure 3 (highlighted in blue and red, respectively).
The first segment is composed of three different structural elements:
a β-strand, an α-helix, and a short turn connecting them,
with the latter component being the only element exposed to solvent,
which explains the very low rate of deuterium uptake within this segment
of Tf. In addition to being sequestered from solvent, the strand and
the helix apparently reduce the flexibility of the connecting turn,
thereby limiting amide exchange within this structural element as
well. Unlike Val396–Leu408, Leu671–Pro679 is a part of a single structural element
of Tf, an α-helix (Figure 3).23 Despite being fully structured in the crystallized
form of Tf, this element is localized within the C-terminus of this
protein, and is fully exposed to the solvent. Furthermore, two proline
residues located within this helix are expected to weaken the internal
network of hydrogen bonds stabilizing this element. The disulfide
link connecting this helix to Val396–Leu408 is the only “re-enforcer” of its structure besides
the internal hydrogen bonds, and it is therefore not surprising that
the residues located within the immediate vicinity of the cysteine
residue (Cys674) are much less flexible than the rest of
this segment and, therefore, have much higher backbone amide protection
(as reflected by the HDX MS measurements).

peptide dimers characterized by
HDX MS/MS within the crystal structure of Tf (PDB ID: 2HAV).

The data presented and discussed in the preceding
paragraphs were
collected under conditions that are typically used in HDX MS/MS experiments
to minimize the extent of hydrogen scrambling in the gas phase. In
general, these settings seek to minimize collisional activation of
ions, as it has been shown to be a major factor contributing to hydrogen
scrambling within protein and peptide ions prior to their dissociation
by ECD.24 However, the common “intra-chain”
scrambling is not expected to affect the outcome of HDX MS/MS measurements
presented in this work; only interchain proton hopping would result
in alteration of the measured deuterium content of the fragments produced
by dissociation of the disulfide bond. The possible role of collisional
activation of peptide dimer ions as a trigger of interchain disulfide
scrambling was examined by using a higher RF amplitude (1400 V vs
500 V) during isolation of precursor ions in the front-end quadrupole.
Isotopic distributions for 1 min exchange data collected at the two
different RF values were indistinguishable. Since collisional activation
of peptide ions does not induce noticeable interchain scrambling,
it is possible to use it as a means of enhancing the ionic signal
prior to peptide dimer fragmentation if the experimental goal is to
separate monomeric subunits by cleaving the disulfide bond in the
gas phase. However, in this case, it might be impossible to use any
other fragments (produced by cleavage of the backbone) to obtain site-specific
information, since their deuterium content is likely to be altered
by hydrogen scrambling.

Another opportunity to enhance the signal-to-noise
ratio in measurements
of the deuterium content of monomeric subunits within the peptide
dimers might be offered by the recently introduced HDX MS/MS scheme
where the LC step is eliminated from the work flow, using a continuous
flow apparatus instead.25,26 The desired level of
the signal-to-noise ratio in this case is achieved by dramatically
increasing the data acquisition window as the entire complement of
peptic fragments generated under the slow exchange conditions are
continuously infused into the ion source, and the high dynamic range
and resolving power of FTICR MS are used to mass-select the peptide
of interest for fragmentation under conditions that minimize hydrogen
scrambling. This scheme might allow the deuterium occupancy to be
probed at individual amides in addition to physically separating the
monomeric subunits of peptide dimers. Finally, successful fragmentation
of thiol–thiol linkages using ECD (or its sister technique
ETD) under the conditions minimizing (or eliminating) hydrogen scrambling
may also increase the range of proteins amenable to top-down HDX MS/MS
analysis,27 which is currently restricted
to small proteins without disulfide bonds.28−31

Conclusions
Disulfide-rich
proteins have traditionally been challenging targets
for HDX MS studies, because of incomplete reduction of thiol–thiol
linkages, which is a consequence of the quench conditions used to
minimize amide back-exchange in peptides prior to MS analysis of their
deuterium content: limited time, low temperature, and low pH. Traditionally,
the principal strategy to address difficult-to-reduce or high-density
disulfides in the HDX MS workflow is a brute force approach utilizing
high concentrations of reductant and denaturant prior to (or even
in combination with) digestion. The effectiveness of this approach
is protein-dependent and extended incubation times frequently employed
to enhance exposure to reductant invariably result in an undesirable
increase in H/D back exchange. More recently, a novel electrochemical
approach to reduce disulfides in solution under quench conditions
prior to LC-MS has been reported for insulin.32 While electrochemical reduction shows promise, several limitations
were identified, an apparent requirement for low-salt conditions,
a higher-than-optimal temperature (10 °C), and a current cell
pressure limit of 50 bar. In this work, electron capture dissociation
(ECD) was used to circumvent the disulfide problem, since it effectively
cleaves external disulfide bonds. Dissociation of the disulfide-linked
peptide dimers can be accomplished on the fast LC time scale and produces
abundant signals for monomeric subunits without interchain hydrogen
scrambling, even when collisional activation of ions is applied prior
to ion selection and ECD fragmentation. Inclusion of ECD in the HDX
MS workflow results in increased sequence coverage and spatial resolution
and provides an attractive alternative to extensive chemical reduction
of disulfide-rich proteins.
