An
antibody-based analytical method for the detection of a chemical
flame retardant using antibody fragments isolated from an alpaca has
been developed. One specific chemical flame retardant congener, 2,2′,4,4′-tetrabrominated
diphenyl ether (BDE-47), is often the major poly-BDE (PBDE) congener
present in human and environmental samples and that which is the most
frequently detected. An alpaca was immunized with a surrogate of BDE-47
covalently attached to a carrier protein. The resulting mRNA coding
for the variable domain of heavy-chain antibodies (VHH) were isolated,
transcribed to cDNA, and cloned into a phagemid vector for phage display
library construction. Selection of VHHs recognizing BDE-47 was achieved
by panning under carefully modified conditions. The assay sensitivity
for detecting BDE-47 was down to the part-per-billion (microgram per
liter) level. Cross-reactivity analyses confirmed that this method
was highly selective for BDE-47 and selected hydroxylated metabolites.
When exposed to elevated temperatures, the camelid VHH antibodies
retained more reactivity than a polyclonal antibody developed to the
same target analyte. The use of this VHH antibody reagent immobilized
onto a Au electrode for impedance biosensing demonstrates the increased
versatility of VHH antibodies.

==== Body
Polybrominated diphenyl ethers
(PBDEs) are a class of compounds that have been used as flame retardant
additives since the 1970s. They
have been widely used in electronics, furniture foam, and plastics.
Since PBDEs are used as additive chemicals, they possess a greater
potential to leach from the original product during their lifetime.1 In 2004, the United States phased out the manufacture
and import of two of the three formulations (penta-BDE and octa-BDE): http://www.epa.gov/oppt/existingchemicals/pubs/actionplans/pbde.html. The third formulation (deca-BDE) was phased out at the end of 2013: http://www.epa.gov/oppt/existingchemicals/pubs/actionplans/deccadbe.html. Despite the bans, the continued release of PBDEs from already existing
products is expected for many years to come.2

Although the use of PBDEs has declined, environmental and
human
monitoring for PBDEs levels has begun and will continue, due to historical
high production volumes and the persistence of PBDEs in the environment.1 PBDEs are presently on the designated chemicals
list for the California Biomonitoring Program and are targets for
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Report
on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals. PBDEs have been found
extensively in human breast milk,3 food
products,4,5 and house dust.5,6 Currently,
it is suspected that prenatal exposure to PBDEs results in neurodevelopmental
deficiencies7,8 and reproductive effects9,10 due to its structural similarity to thyroid hormones.

Human
and environmental monitoring programs are often limited by
the cost and complexity of sample testing. From previous monitoring
work, one specific congener, 2,2′,4,4′-tetra-BDE (BDE-47)
is often the PBDE congener present at the highest concentrations and
that which is the most frequently detected. BDE-47 was selected as
the representative congener to monitor because, when it is present,
the other PBDE congeners are as well. Because of this, and based on
our previous work developing successful polyclonal antibodies (pAbs)
that selectively recognize BDE-47,11 we
aimed to develop a more stable and sustainable source of antibodies
highly selective for BDE-47.

Immunoassays traditionally have
relied on either pAbs from a wide
range of animals (e.g., goats, rabbits, mice) or monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) from mice. pAbs can differ considerably between individuals
and over time within an individual. This variability detracts from
their utility as a standard and precise analytical tool. From a technical
standpoint, pAbs are less expensive, faster to produce and often more
sensitive than mAbs. However, in the long term, the possession of
a single, highly selective antibody in virtually unlimited supply
can be very attractive. The development of mAbs, led by Kohler and
Milstein12 in the 1970s, has eliminated
the variability in molecular recognition that plagued analyses using
pAbs. Therefore, mAbs have become the preferred biological recognition
molecule of immunoassays intended for regulatory purposes.

Recently,
a new type of antibody molecule has been discovered in
camelids13 (Figure 1). These antibodies are devoid of the light chain and still exhibit
antigen-binding exclusively on the variable domain of the heavy chain
(VHH). The single domain nature of VHHs makes them highly amenable
to genetic manipulation and easy to express in various expression
systems.14,15 With the discovery of the natural existence
of VHH and advances in molecular engineering, the ability to express
VHHs in prokaryotic cultures opens new opportunities for developing
antibodies that allow for high-throughput screening, exhibit monoclonality
properties and have the ability to perpetuate in culture.

Figure 1 Schematic representation
of the peptide domains for camelid antibodies.
(Image adapted from ref (16).) The molecular weight of a conventional Ab is 150–160
kDa, a camelid HCAb is 90–100 kDa, and a nanobody is 12–15
kDa.

In this work, we aimed to develop
a more stable and sustainable
source of antibodies selective for BDE-47. An alpaca was immunized
with a surrogate molecule of BDE-47 covalently attached to a carrier
protein. The resulting mRNA coding for the heavy chain antibodies
was isolated, transcribed to cDNA, and cloned into a phagemid vector
for phage display library construction. Selection of VHHs recognizing
free BDE-47 was achieved by panning under carefully modified conditions.
Sensitivity down to part-per-billion level was achieved, which is
relevant for biomonitoring work. Furthermore, we have demonstrated
the ease with which these reagents could be incorporated into a well-established
electrochemical impedance biosensor format that typically employs
conventional antibodies. These VHH-based assays could be used for
routine biomonitoring efforts to perform screening analyses of samples
before more costly follow-up methods are completed. Thus, the development
of rapid methods for chemical detection has great potential in the
area of environmental chemistry and human health biomonitoring.

Experimental
Section
All regents and consumables were purchased from Fisher/Thermo
Scientific
or Sigma, unless stated otherwise. Pure chemical standards (i.e.,
PBDEs, tetrabromobisphenol-A, triclosan, etc.) were handled in a fume
hood and after being used were disposed of as hazardous waste. Due
to the use of bacteriophage and bacterial cultures, all items that
were in contact with these reagents were immersed in a 10% bleach
solution for at least 1 h before they were discarded or autoclaved.

Immunization
Protocol
All animal studies were conducted
in accordance with the guidelines established by the internal institutional
animal care and use committee. A 4 year old castrated male alpaca
received a subcutaneous injection of a 2 mL emulsion of 10 mM phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (1:1 by volume)
containing 200 μg of hapten C1-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH).11 Subsequent immunizations were completed with
the same dose at 2 week intervals. Serum samples were collected prior
to the first immunization and 4 days prior to the third, fourth, and
fifth immunizations.

Phage Displayed VHH Library Construction
The library
construction followed the protocol previously described.17 Briefly, lymphocytes were isolated from 10 mL
of alpaca blood following the fourth immunization. Total RNA was extracted,
used to synthesize cDNA, and amplified using VHH IgG specific primers.
The generated VHH cDNAs were cloned into the pComb3x phagemid vector
(generous gift from Dr. Carlos Barbas III, Scripps Research Institute,
La Jolla, CA) and expressed as pIII fusion protein on the surface
of M13 filamentous phage. The resulting phage display VHH library
was amplified in a suppressor strain of Escherichia
coli, cultured, and harvested by poly(ethylene glycol)
(PEG) precipitation before panning. Briefly, the culture was centrifuged
(8000g for 15 min at 4 °C) and the supernatant
was transferred to a new centrifuge bottle. A solution of PEG/NaCl
(5×, PEG-8000 20% w/v, NaCl 2.5 M) was added to the supernatant
and incubated on ice for 2 h. The solution was again centrifuged,
and the white phage pellet was resuspended in 10 mL of suspension
buffer (PBS containing 1× protease inhibitor cocktail, 0.02%
NaN3, 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)), and filtered through
a 0.22 μm membrane.

BDE-47 Selective VHH Phage Clone Selection
Phage clones
binding specifically BDE-47 were selected by competitive elution with
minor modifications to the previously described method.18 Four rounds of panning were conducted with increasingly
stringent conditions (Table 1). Hapten C1 (see
Table 2 for molecular structure) was employed
as both the immunizing and the coating hapten because it presents
the entirety of the BDE-47 structure and possesses a rigid handle.
Two wells of a microtiter plate (Nunc MaxiSorp) were coated with 100
μL of the coating antigen, BDE-C1 conjugated to BSA, in carbonate/bicarbonate
coating buffer (CCB; 100 mM, pH 9.8), while eight wells were coated
with 100 μL of BSA (30 μg/mL, in PBS) for postabsorption,
at room temperature (RT). All 10 wells were blocked with 3% skim milk
in PBS. For each round of panning, 150 μL of the amplified phage
library (about 1012 PFU) and 10 μL of methanol were
first added to the 2 BDE–C1–BSA-coated wells. For the
first round of panning, the phages were incubated with constant shaking
for 2 h. These wells were washed with five rinses of 200 μL
per well of PBS–Tween (PBST, 0.05% Tween) with 5 min incubations
between rinses. The bound phages were eluted by the addition of 100
μL of BDE-47 analyte in 5% methanol with shaking for 1 h. Then,
25 μL of the eluted phages was dispersed into each of the BSA-coated
wells to allow for binding of any nonspecific phages. After a 30 min
incubation at RT with shaking, the phages in the supernatant were
collected and pooled. ER2738 E. coli were infected with the eluted phages and titered on LB–ampicillin
(amp) agar plates (recorded as “output” titers), and
150 μL was used for reamplification. The reamplified phages
were titered again on LB–amp agar plates (recorded as “input”
titers), and 200 μL of the amplified phages was employed again
in the next round of panning. For the second, third, and fourth rounds,
the same procedure was used, except for the following two changes:
the first incubation in the antigen-coated wells was completed in
1 h instead of 2 h, and the number of rinses was increased to 10 times
from 5. After each round of panning, the phage pool activity toward
the coating antigen and by competition with the BDE-47 analyte was
confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and competitive
inhibition ELISA (cELISA), respectively.

BDE-47 Selective VHH Expression and Purification
From
the agar plate containing the fourth elution output titer, 16 individual
clones were randomly selected and grown individually in overnight
cultures. Two 2 mL cultures were prepared for each clone: one for
DNA extraction and one for VHH–pIII protein extraction. Both
cultures for each clone were spun down at 3000g for
10 min. For the DNA extracted cultures, the Qiagen Mini Prep kit was
employed and the sequences were submitted to the UC Davis DNA Sequencing
facility. For the protein extraction, the bacterial protein extraction
reagent kit (BPER) was employed and the obtained protein was further
characterized by ELISA and cELISA.

From the cELISA results,
the clone with the highest sensitivity to BDE-47 [i.e., lowest half-maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50 value)] was selected. In
order to express this selected VHH protein free from the pIII peptide,
50 ng of DNA was transformed into 20 μL of Top10F′ cells
(Life Technologies) by heat shock following manufacturer’s
instructions. Individual colonies were amplified overnight, and an
aliquot was grown in a 200 mL culture to OD (600 nm) ∼0.8 and
induced with 1 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG). After overnight growth, the cells were collected by centrifugation
at 3000g for 10 min and the protein was extracted
using the BPER method. The extracted VHH protein, which contains a
6xHis tag [as well as a hemagglutinin (HA)], was passed through a
0.22 μm filter and then applied directly to a HisPur resin for
purification. After washing with 40 mM imidazole/PBS, the protein
was eluted with 6 mL of 250 mM imidazole/PBS. The purity was assessed
by running a 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS–PAGE), stained with Sypro Ruby gel stain (Life Technologies),
and visualized on a UV gel document reader. The eluted protein was
dialyzed against three 1 L changes of PBS, and the protein concentration
was determined using a NanoDrop Lite (Thermo Scientific). The VHH
protein was stored at 1 mg/mL at −15 °C prior to analysis.

BDE-47 VHH ELISA Characterization
Coating Hapten Influence
A suite of previously prepared
coating antigens was employed to determine the optimal coating antigen
that would result in the most sensitive assay. Wells of high-binding
microtiter plates were coated with various antigens (structures and
names provided in Table 2) at 1 μg/mL
in CCB for 1 h at RT with gentle rocking. Wells were blocked with
0.5% BSA in PBST. The plates were incubated with duplicate serial
dilutions of VHH (100 μL/well) in PBS for 1 h at RT with gentle
rocking. Plates were then washed with five washes of PBST. Secondary
antibody (anti-HA-horse radish peroxidase (HRP; Abcam, Cambridge,
MA) was used at manufacturer’s recommended protocol. Following
another wash with PBST five times, HRP activity was determined by
colorimetric tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution addition and
stopped with 1 M sulfuric acid. Well absorbance was read at 450 nm
with a plate reader. The amount of antibody activity toward the hapten
was determined by calculating the units of antibody activity at the
EC50.

To determine the influence of coating hapten
on sensitivity toward BDE-47, cELISAs were conducted. The plates were
coated as before with each hapten in duplicate at 1 μg/mL. The
concentration of VHH used for each hapten was 2 times the EC50 value as determined by ELISA and added equally to all wells. BDE-47
was serially diluted and added to the wells. VHH antibody (50 μL/well)
in PBS and BDE-47 (50 μL/well) in PBS containing 40% dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) were incubated for 1 h at RT with gentle rocking
and developed as described above.

Temperature Stability
Stability of the anti-BDE-47
VHH (clone no. 7), as well as the pAb, was assessed by heating aliquots
of each to temperatures of 55, 75, and 95 °C for 10 and for 60
min in PCR tubes in a DNA engine thermal cycler (BioRad, Hercules,
CA). After cooling to RT, the antibody samples were assayed for performance
by ELISA, as described above.

Cross-Reactivity
The selectivity of the assay was determined
by cELISA to examine the activity of the anti-BDE-47 VHH toward structurally
related BDE congeners and other contaminants. The analytes included
BDE-99 (98% purity, AccuStandard, New Haven, CT), BDE-100 (98% purity,
AccuStandard), BDE-143 (98% purity, AccuStandard), BDE-153 (98% purity,
AccuStandard), BDE-183 (98% purity, AccuStandard), 5′-OH-BDE-47
(98% purity, AccuStandard), 6′-OH-BDE-47 (98% purity, AccuStandard),
tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA; 97% purity), bisphenol A (99% purity),
triclosan (97% purity), and triclocarban (99% purity). All of these
analytes were employed at the highest soluble concentration in PBS
buffer containing 40% DMSO. Serial dilutions were performed in this
same buffer. Plates were coated at 1 μg/mL of C2-BSA and blocked
with 0.5% BSA in PBST, as described above. The final VHH antibody
concentration in each well was 0.5 μg/mL. Cross-reactivity (CR)
values were defined as 1  

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)
Measurements
To evaluate if these VHH antibodies were amenable
for use in biosensor
formats commonly utilizing conventional IgG antibodies, an electrochemical
impedance biosensor format was employed (Figure 2). The Au working electrode (WE) was fixed by an O-ring onto an electrochemical
cell constructed from virgin Teflon with an electrode area of 0.19
cm2 and a cell volume of 6 mL. The Au electrode was cleaned
and then modified by immersion for 17 h into 1.0 mM 11-mercaptanoic
acid (11-MUA) and 50 mM PBS (pH = 10) to form a self-assembled monolayer
with carboxylate termination. The terminal carboxylate groups were
then activated for 1 h in 75 mM 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDC) and 15 mM N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide
(sulfo-NHS) in 50 mM PBS solution (pH = 7.3). The VHH-coated electrode
is then created by immersion for 1 h into a solution containing 50
μg/mL VHH and 50 mM PBS at pH 7.3, which forms amide bonds to
the amine groups on the VHH surface. This is followed by immersion
in 0.1% BSA for 1 h to reduce the nonspecific adsorption.

Figure 2 Schematic representation
of an electrochemical cell setup employed.
Au working electrode (WE) is used to immobilize protein reagents:
reference electrode (RE), counter electrode (CE).

All electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were
performed
with a three-electrode configuration using a Pt spiral counter electrode
(CE) and a Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) reference electrode (RE) (Figure 2). The background test solution contained 50 mM
PBS and 5.0 mM K3Fe(CN)6/K4Fe(CN)6 at pH 7.3, with varying concentrations of BDE-47. Impedance
measurements were performed using a Gamry Reference 600 potentiostat
(Gamry Instruments, Warminster, PA) over the frequency range from
0.05 Hz to 15 kHz with an ac probe amplitude of 5 mV. Each impedance
spectrum takes about 2.8 min to acquire.

Results
and Discussion
BDE-47 Selective VHH Phage Clone Selection
After four
rounds of panning, of the 16 clones selected, 15 grew sufficiently
in an overnight culture to provide suitable DNA for sequencing. Of
these 15 clones that were successfully sequenced, there were only
four unique peptide sequences (defined as more than two amino acid
changes out of the total 140 amino acids for the VHH portion of the
peptide), but these varied from each other by more than 30 amino acids
(Figure 3). The highest density of amino acid
changes occur in the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) (1,
2, and 3), as expected, while framework region (FR) 3 contains only
five to six changes. The most abundant pattern (with seven homologous
clones) was annotated as group A. There were two clones in group B
and three clones in both groups C and D. From the culture media, the
secreted VHH–pIII peptide products were assessed for initial
sensitivity toward BDE-47.

Figure 3 Sequences corresponding to the four VHH groups
were aligned, numbered,
and divided into framework (FR) and complementarity determining regions
(CDR) using previously published llama (ref (19)) and alpaca (ref (20)) sequence analyses based
on standard immunoglobulin numbering (ref (21)). “∼” = gap to produce
alignment with standard immunoglobulin structure; “.”
= same amino acid residue as group A in that position. The number
in parentheses indicates the number of times that sequence was repeated
within the 15 clones selected.

A cELISA was completed employing the supernatant containing
secreted
VHH–pIII protein from the individual clone’s overnight
cultures. The competing analyte was BDE-47 (Figure 4). The lines on the graph indicate the means (± standard
deviation) for all of the clones with unique peptide sequences. Group
A clones exhibited the highest sensitivity (IC50 = 68 ±
9.3 μg/L), followed by groups B and C (IC50 = 400
μg/L), and group D (IC50 = not determinable). From
the seven clones in group A, one clone (no. 7) was selected for cell
transformation, VHH protein amplification, and further assay characterization.

their target BDE-47. Each group represents pooled values for the clones
and each point is a mean. Standard deviation bars are only shown for
group A.

Coating Antigen Selection
The selected anti-BDE-47
VHH (clone no. 7) from group A was transformed into a nonsuppressor
cell line Top10F′ with an amber stop codon allowing amplification
of the VHH gene without pIII, but still possessing the 6xHis and HA
tags for purification and detection, respectively. The purified VHH
protein was then screened for its activity toward a variety of heterologous
haptens previously described11 (Table 2). Screening was completed by titering the VHH protein
against the hapten–BSA conjugates coated at 1 μg/mL.
The VHH exhibited no activity toward those haptens possessing only
one ring (type D) or those substituted in the 2′ position (type
A). Those haptens substituted in either the 4′ (type B) or
5′ (type C) positions yield higher activity. Of these haptens,
the highest sensitivity toward BDE-47, as determined by the lowest
IC50 value, was obtained using the C2 hapten. The other
haptens (C1, the immunizing hapten, and B2) possessing three carbon
linking arms also produced comparably sensitive assays. This is in
contrast to the pAb developed previously in this laboratory where
the heterologous hapten assay format greatly improved the assay sensitivity.11 Hapten C2 was the selected hapten used for the
rest of the study and for development of the standard curve employing
the purified VHH (Figure 5).

C2-BSA and HIS-purified clone no. 7 from group A. Each point indicates
the mean ± standard deviation of triplicate samples. The IC50 value was determined using a four-parameter logistic plot
equation and is reported as value ± standard error.

Analyte Cross-Reactivity
The selectivity
of the assay
was examined by conducting CR analyses with a variety of structurally
similar compounds (Figure 6). The antibody
is highly selective for the hydroxylated metabolite 5′-OH-BDE-47
(60% CR) and less so for the 6′-OH-BDE-47 (∼10% CR).
The antibody also demonstrates CR with the BDE-99 (15%) and BDE-100
(7%) congeners, but no CR with BDE-153, -154, and -183 congeners.
Little (<5%) or no CR was observed for triclosan, triclocarban,
bisphenol A, and TBBPA. The selectivity of this assay makes it valuable
for human biomonitoring where both the parent and the metabolites
can serve as indicators of exposure. In addition, the assay will not
detect other structurally similar compounds (i.e., triclosan) or chemicals
used for the same purpose (i.e., TBBPA used as a fire retardant) that
are also currently being detected in human biomonitoring samples.22−24

each analyte are provided and are aligned over its respective bar.
In the case where no IC50 value could be determined for
the analyte, no resulting CR% could be determined. Each analyte was
assessed in duplicate.

Temperature Stability
Many studies have presented results
suggesting that some VHH peptides display improved thermal stability
as compared to conventional IgGs.25 Often
these studies demonstrated that a fraction of the VHHs tested are
completely temperature-tolerant (no reduced activity when heated),
while some VHHs do lose a varying amount of activity. Therefore, in
an effort to characterize how the anti-BDE-47 VHH antibody performs
compared to its rabbit pAb counterpart, these antibodies were heated
to various temperatures for two different durations. A standard antigen
selective ELISA was performed to assess retention of binding activity
after temperature incubation. As shown in Figure 7, for both the VHH and the pAb, the activity drops with increasing
temperature and with increased duration at that temperature. However,
the VHH antibody retains greater than 50% of its activity when exposed
to 95 °C for 10 min and more than 25% of its activity when exposed
to 95 °C for 60 min, while the pAb’s activity is below
6% after either 10 or 60 min of incubation at 95 °C. These results
are similar to studies that also compared the thermal stability of
VHHs and conventional antibodies (rabbit or mouse IgG) toward their
respective antigens.25−28

was assessed in triplicate.

Biomolecular Recognition with Detection by Electrochemical Impedance
Spectroscopy
Biosensors typically utilize biomolecules such
as antibodies, receptor proteins, or DNA immobilized onto a solid
support. VHH may be easier and less expensive to produce for use in
solid-state biosensors. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was
used to demonstrate detection of BDE-47 using a VHH immobilized onto
a Au electrode (Figure 2). Impedance methods
have been widely studied for biosensor signal transduction.29−31 During impedance biosensing, ac interrogation of the interface allows
indirect monitoring of the change in polymer/protein film thickness
at an electrode onto which a recognition biomolecule is immobilized.
Figure 8 is a Nyquist plot of the impedance
spectrum as a function of increasing BDE-47 concentration at a Au
electrode onto which the anti-BDE-47 VHH is immobilized.

Figure 8 Nyquist plot
of the impedance response for increasing concentrations
of BDE-47 at a Au electrode onto which the BDE-47 VHH is immobilized.

The results of Figure 8 can be fit to the
Randles equivalent circuit with the differential capacitance (Cd) replaced with a constant phase element (CPE),
whose impedance is given by32−34 2  where T is the CPE magnitude
and n is the phase exponent. In the Randles circuit, Rct is the charge-transfer resistance, RS is solution resistance, and ZW is the Warburg impedance, which is not fit here. Table 3 provides the best-fit equivalent circuit parameters
for the results shown in Figure 8. From the
measurement of Rct in Table 3, the detection limit for BDE-47 is approximately 0.79 μg/L
for the Au electrode at which the VHH is immobilized, which is about
39% lower than the detection limit (1.3 μg/L) obtained for a
Au electrode at which the pAb is immobilized.35 The improved sensitivity may reflect the lower thickness of the
interfacial polymer–protein film associated with the VHH (∼17
kDa) relative to the pAb (∼150 kDa). In other words, the sensitivity
and detection limit of electrochemical sensors is improved by sensing
through a thinner polymer–protein film. This may be important
for impedance detection of small molecule analytes such as endocrine-disrupting
chemicals.35

Conclusions
We
have demonstrated that a new type of antibody fragment, a VHH
from an alpaca, exhibits comparable sensitivity and selectivity to
previously developed conventional antibodies yet it also exhibits
increased resilience to heat. The BDE-47 hapten used produced not
only a substantial response upon immunization but also an array of
individual VHHs with diverse sequences and good sensitivity. This
again illustrates the value of a rigid conjugated handle on the hapten
resulting in a planar molecule which appears to present the analyte
mimic well. This work highlights the usefulness of alpaca VHHs as
a technology to produce assays for small lipophilic molecules. The
success can also be attributed to the fact that the immunizing hapten
was previously utilized in rabbits to generate an immune response.
This is a recommended strategy for future studies. Several species
of camelids have been used to produce VHH for immunoassay development.
Our work demonstrates that the alpaca is useful for this approach
with their smaller size, lower cost, and gentle disposition offering
advantages over many other camelids. Moreover, since the VHH protein
is expressed as a single gene, it is easily manipulated with molecular
tools, which results in the generation of a large quantity of protein
using economical reagents. In addition, binding sensitivities can
be improved through in vitro antibody maturation techniques such as
site-directed or random mutagenesis. Labels for detection can be incorporated
into VHH using simple genetic approaches, such as fusion with enzymes
(e.g., AP, luceriferase) or fluorescent proteins (e.g., GFP). Furthermore,
our work demonstrates that these antibodies can be rapidly incorporated
into assays and sensor platforms that have traditionally been designed
for use with conventional antibodies. Because of their smaller size,
the VHH can be immobilized at higher densities on surfaces and reactive
group incorporation (via genetic means) can improve oriented immobilization.
