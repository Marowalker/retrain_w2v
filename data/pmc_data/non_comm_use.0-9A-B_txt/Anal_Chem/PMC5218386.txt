The
major structural components of protective mucus hydrogels on
mucosal surfaces are the secreted polymeric gel-forming mucins. The
very high molecular weight and extensive O-glycosylation of gel-forming
mucins, which are key to their viscoelastic properties, create problems
when studying mucins using conventional biochemical/structural techniques.
Thus, key structural information, such as the secondary structure
of the various mucin subdomains, and glycosylation patterns along
individual molecules, remains to be elucidated. Here, we utilized
Raman spectroscopy, Raman optical activity (ROA), circular dichroism
(CD), and tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to study the structure
of the secreted polymeric gel-forming mucin MUC5B. ROA indicated that
the protein backbone of MUC5B is dominated by unordered conformation,
which was found to originate from the heavily glycosylated central
mucin domain by isolation of MUC5B O-glycan-rich regions. In sharp
contrast, recombinant proteins of the N-terminal region of MUC5B (D1-D2-D′-D3
domains, NT5B), C-terminal region of MUC5B (D4-B-C-CK domains, CT5B)
and the Cys-domain (within the central mucin domain of MUC5B) were
found to be dominated by the β-sheet. Using these findings,
we employed TERS, which combines the chemical specificity of Raman
spectroscopy with the spatial resolution of atomic force microscopy
to study the secondary structure along 90 nm of an individual MUC5B
molecule. Interestingly, the molecule was found to contain a large
amount of α-helix/unordered structures and many signatures of
glycosylation, pointing to a highly O-glycosylated region on the mucin.

==== Body
Saliva and
other mucous secretions
are viscoelastic hydrogels that are important protective barriers
at epithelial surfaces. The major structural components of these hydrogels
are the polymeric gel-forming mucins that are extremely large, densely
glycosylated proteins. The gel-forming mucin network protects the
body’s surfaces from dehydration, injury, and colonization
by pathogens1 and in the gastrointestinal
(GI) tract provides a niche for commensal microbes. Furthermore, gel-forming
mucins in the GI tract also interact with dietary molecules, as has
recently been shown for the salivary mucin MUC5B and green tea polyphenols,
which may affect the absorption of nutrients and alter mucin network
organization.2

The five gel-forming
mucin family members (MUC2, MUC5B, MUC5AC,
MUC6, and MUC19) have different tissue localization but similar domain
organization (e.g., Figure 1a depicts the domain organization of a MUC5B monomer, the
major mucin in saliva and respiratory mucus). The central mucin domain
is repetitive and contains STP-rich regions that are substantially
glycosylated with structurally diverse O-linked glycan chains (Figure 1b). This central
highly O-glycosylated portion of gel-forming mucins is interrupted
with, and flanked by, cysteine-rich, substantially less glycosylated
protein domains. At the N- and C-terminal regions, these cysteine-rich
domains are essential for mucin polymerization via disulfide bridges
into very high weight (MW), polydisperse (2–40 MDa) macromolecules
that entangle and cross-link (mainly by noncovalent interactions)
to form an organized network.3−7 The small cysteine-rich domains (Cys-domains) that interrupt the
central O-glycan rich region of mucins may also support mucin cross-linking.8

Figure 1 Domain organization of MUC5B. (a) Schematic representation
of a
MUC5B monomer. The N-terminal region is composed of vWF-like domains
(D1, D2, D′, D3), the central region is highly repetitive,
heavily glycosylated and is interrupted by Cys-rich subdomains (Cys-domains),
and the C-terminal region is composed of vWF-like domains (D4, B,
C, CK). (b) Mucin glycan diversity. O-glycans that decorate the STP-rich
central mucin domain (repetitive and nonrepetitive sequences) are
composed of 5 major monosaccharides but differ in composition, branching,
length, and modification by sulfation and acetylation, contributing
to the heterogeneity of mucins.

The length (0.5–10 μm), polydispersity, and
extended
conformation of polymeric gel-forming mucins has been demonstrated
by electron microscopy (EM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), light
scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and neutron scattering
(SANS) studies.7,9−11 These techniques
have also demonstrated the extended topography of isolated mucin O-glycan
rich regions and globular nature of mucin N- and C-terminal regions.8,12−15

Despite these breakthroughs, there are important questions
that
remain regarding the architecture of gel-forming mucins. For instance,
what is the secondary structure of the various mucin subdomains; what
are the locations of the various mucin subdomains along a single mucin
chain; and do glycosylation patterns exist along individual molecules?
Answers to these questions have been hindered by the size, polydispersity,
and dense glycosylation of mucins, which make them unsuitable for
investigation by conventional structural techniques. Here, we aim
to shed light on these finer details of mucin architecture by utilizing
a novel toolbox of complementary vibrational spectroscopies.

Raman spectroscopy analyzes characteristic vibrational modes within
a molecule that depend on the nature of the functional groups. A derivative
of Raman spectroscopy is Raman optical activity (ROA), which is sensitive
to molecular chirality and particularly sensitive to the secondary
and tertiary structures of biomolecules. Circular dichroism (CD) in
the UV region is similarly sensitive to chirality but monitors electronic
transitions rather than vibrational ones and is also sensitive to
protein secondary structure. Therefore, analysis by Raman, ROA, and
CD offers a powerful approach for deciphering the secondary structure
of complex biological molecules, such as full-length mucins and mucin
subdomains.16

In addition, tip-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy (TERS) is a novel
technique that combines the chemical specificity of Raman spectroscopy
with the spatial resolution of AFM and offers a unique opportunity
to examine mucin structure along the length of an individual molecule.
In contrast to ROA and CD, TERS exclusively probes the surface of
a sample enabling a differentiation of core and surface composition
of proteins, as has been demonstrated for amyloid fibrils.17,18

Here, we isolate the high MW, polymeric gel-forming mucin
MUC5B
from human whole saliva and generate MUC5B subdomains of the various
“sugar-rich” regions (central O-glycan-rich regions)
and “protein-rich” regions (N- and C-terminal regions
and Cys-domains, which are substantially less glycosylated). We investigate
their structures by Raman, ROA, and CD to reveal previously unknown
information about the secondary structure of the various mucin subdomains.
Furthermore, we measure the first TER spectra with spatial resolution
along the length of a single MUC5B molecule and identify signatures
of mucin secondary structure and glycosylation. Such spatially resolved
structural information has not previously been reported for even simple
glycoproteins, let alone the highly complex mucins. Our application
of Raman, ROA, CD, and TERS spectroscopies to polymeric mucins has
provided a new level of structural understanding of these complex
glycoproteins.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Agarose,
cesium chloride (CsCl), and dithiothreitol
(DTT) were purchased from Melford Laboratories (Ipswich, U.K.). Monosaccharides
and amino acids were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, U.K.).

Mucin
Purification
For MUC5B isolation, healthy volunteers
with no overt sign of oral pathologies and who had provided their
written consent were asked to donate saliva into a sterile container
at least 1 h after consumption of food or drink. Ethical approval
for this research was obtained from the University of Manchester.
Saliva samples were immediately pooled and solubilized in CsCl/0.10
M NaCl at a starting density of 1.4 g/mL, in the presence of a protease
inhibitor cocktail (Supporting Information) at 4 °C overnight. Under these conditions, MUC5B was purified
by isopycnic density gradient centrifugation, followed by density
gradient centrifugation in CsCl/0.10 M NaCl at a starting density
of 1.5 g/mL, in a Beckman L-90 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Ti45 rotor,
72 h, 40 000 rpm, 15 °C, Figure S1).19

Mucin Subdomain Preparation
The O-glycan-rich regions
of MUC5B were generated from purified, polymeric MUC5B by reduction
and alkylation and subsequent trypsin digestion, followed by removal
of tryptic peptides, as described previously.2 The average MW of glycan-rich regions was found to be 546 kDa by
size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle laser light
scattering.20 An N-terminal construct of
MUC5B, consisting of D1-D2-D′-D3 domains (NT5B, residues 26–1304)
and a C-terminal construct of MUC5B, consisting of D4-B-C-CK domains
(CT5B, residues 4958–5765), were created, expressed, and purified.2 A construct of the seventh Cys-domain of MUC5B
(residues 4128–4235) was created, expressed, and purified in
the same way as NT5B and CT5B, with the following exception: the size-exclusion
chromatography step was performed on a Superdex 75 column 10/300GL
(GE Healthcare).

Sample Preparation for Raman and ROA
Monosaccharides
were prepared to 40 mg/mL in 0.10 M NaCl, pH 6.0. MUC5B and MUC5B
subdomains were dialyzed into 0.10 M NaCl, pH 6.0 and concentrated
to 5–15 mg/mL in Sartorius Vivaspin 5–10 kDa molecular
weight cut-off (MWCO) columns.

Raman and ROA Data Acquisition
Raman and ROA spectra
were measured using a BioTools ChiralRaman spectrometer. The instrument
was set up in a backscattering geometry and operated with a Nd:VO4
laser with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm and spectral resolution
of 7 cm–1. Samples were measured in quartz microfluorescence
cells. Mucin samples were measured with a laser power of 600 mW at
the sample, laser illumination period of 1.24 s and data were gathered
over a 36–48 h time period, whereas monosaccharide and amino
acid spectra were acquired for 4–12 h. Raman spectral baselines
were corrected based on an approach reported elsewhere,21 averaged and smoothed with a 15 point Savitzky-Golay
filter. Sample and reference Raman spectra were then normalized to
an invariant band (270 cm–1), and then the reference
Raman spectrum of 0.10 M NaCl was subtracted from the sample Raman
spectrum. ROA spectra were averaged and smoothed with a 15 point Savitzky-Golay
filter.

CD Data Acquisition
MUC5B subdomains (NT5B, CT5B, and
Cys-domain) were prepared to 1 mg/mL for CD. CD measurements were
made using an Applied Photophysics Chirascan qCD spectropolarimeter,
step size 0.5 nm, 5 s per time point, and 4 repeats. Measurements
were made in a 0.5 mm quartz cell at 12 °C in 10 mM Tris-HCl,
50 mM NaCl, pH 7.4.

TERS Sample Preparation
Glass coverslips
were washed
in 100% ethanol overnight and air-dried for 2 h before addition of
the sample. Purified MUC5B at 10 μg/mL was extensively dialyzed
against PBS, pH 7.4, and was prepared on a glass substrate by drop-deposition
of 100 μL onto precleaned glass for 30 s, followed by washing
with 6 × 300 μL of ddH2O and air-dried for at
least 24 h before being imaged. Monosaccharides for TERS analysis
were prepared to 1 mM in ddH2O, drop-deposited onto precleaned
glass substrates, and dried under argon, based on established protocols.22

TERS Data Acquisition
TER spectra
and corresponding
AFM images were collected with a Nanowizard II atomic force microscope
(JPK Instrument AG, Germany) mounted on an inverted microscope (Olympus
IX70, Japan) with a confocal Raman spectrometer (Acton Advanced SP2750
A, SI GmbH, Germany) and a 400 pixel charge-coupled device (CCD) camera.
Tap190Al-G (Budget Sensors) AFM-tips were evaporated with 25 nm silver,
as described previously.23 An oil immersion
objective (40×, 1.35 NA, Olympus) was used and a 532 nm laser
as the excitation source. Each TER spectrum was acquired for 5 s.
TER spectra were truncated before 560 cm–1 to remove
the silicon peak from the AFM-tip. Spectral baselines were corrected
and cosmic ray strikes were removed using an in-house Raman toolbox
in Matlab software, developed by Dr. Ben Gardner.24 Data sets of mucin TERS spectra were normalized to the
silicon band at ∼940 cm–1 and then normalized
between 0 and 1. Color-coded heatmaps were generated using the “msheatmap”
function in Matlab.

Results and Discussion
The Raman
and ROA spectra of polymeric, high MW MUC5B (purified
from human whole saliva; Figure S1) are
shown in Figure 2a,b.
The vast majority of peaks in the Raman and ROA spectra of polymeric
MUC5B could be assigned to the major monosaccharide (Fuc, Gal, GalNAc,
GlcNAc, NeuAc) and amino acid (Pro, Ser, Thr, Cys) building blocks
of the central mucin domain (Figures S2 and S3, Tables S1 and S2), demonstrating that the spectra are dominated
by structures within the “sugar-rich” central region
of the mucin. This is further demonstrated by the Raman and ROA spectra
of the MUC5B O-glycan-rich regions (generated from purified MUC5B
by reduction/alkylation and trypsin digestion; Figure 2c,d), which strongly resemble the Raman and
ROA spectra of polymeric MUC5B.

Figure 2 Raman and ROA spectra of MUC5B and MUC5B
subdomains. Polymeric
MUC5B (a,b) and O-glycan-rich regions (c,d) were purified and concentrated
to ∼15 mg/mL in 0.10 M NaCl, pH 6.0 and their Raman (a,c) and
ROA (b,d) spectra measured.

The Raman and ROA spectra of polymeric MUC5B measured here
share
similarities with those of bovine submaxilliary mucin25 and porcine gastric mucin26 previously
reported, reflecting the common building blocks of the various mucin
types. Despite this, differences could also be observed. For example,
it is noteworthy that the negative peak at ∼1109 cm–1 is intense in the ROA spectra of polymeric MUC5B and bovine submaxilliary
mucin (putative bovine Muc5b) and is absent in the ROA spectrum of
the porcine gastric mucin (putative Muc5ac and Muc6). This could reflect
differences in the level of NeuAc, GlcNAc, and Fuc (found to contribute
to the band at ∼1109 cm–1, Table S3), which indeed is in agreement with compositional
analysis of similar mucin preparations.27−29 On the other hand, the
negative peak at ∼1109 cm–1 is reported to
be a signature of disaccharides,30,31 and thus may
indicate an increased length of attached O-glycans in MUC5B/Muc5b
compared to commercial porcine gastric mucin. Perhaps most likely
is that such differences arise due to interplay between different
monosaccharide composition and length of the O-glycans on the various
mucin types.

In order to study mucin secondary structure, the
amide I region
(1640–1700 cm–1) of Raman and ROA spectra
was examined. This region contains a major contribution from the C=O
stretching mode from the polypeptide backbone, with peak position
informative about secondary structure. The amide I band in the Raman
spectrum of polymeric MUC5B is broad, suggesting flexible conformation.
Furthermore, within the amide I region of the ROA spectrum of polymeric
MUC5B there is a weak positive feature at ∼1673 cm–1, which has been observed in the ROA spectra of proteins with unordered
conformation.31−38 This feature can also be observed in the previously reported ROA
spectrum of bovine submaxilliary mucin,25 demonstrating shared secondary structure of mucins between species.
The unordered conformation of mucins is in agreement with mucins historically
being considered as having a random coil conformation attributable
to the central mucin domain that is heavily glycosylated with bulky,
negatively charged sugars, which prevent any order of the protein
backbone. Indeed, the ROA spectrum of MUC5B O-glycan-rich regions
measured here also displays the weak positive feature at ∼1673
cm–1 and has no features assigned to α helix
or β-structure, demonstrating a largely unordered protein backbone
(Figure 2d).

While the heavily glycosylated mucin domain dominates mucin molecular
weight and length, the substantially less glycosylated domains that
flank the mucin domain, which are crucial for mucin polymerization,
contribute far less to mucin molecular weight, making it difficult
to detect their structural signatures by examination of full-length
mucins alone. Therefore, recombinant proteins of the N-terminal region
(NT5B, domains D1-D2-D′-D3), C-terminal region (CT5B, domains
D4-B-C-CK), and a Cys-domain of MUC5B were generated and their Raman
spectra analyzed (Figure 3). The sharp peak in the amide I region of the Raman spectra
of NT5B, CT5B, and Cys-domain is centered at ∼1670, 1672, and
1676 cm–1, respectively. Such peaks have been reported
in the Raman spectra of proteins that are rich in β-structure,39−44 suggesting that these MUC5B subdomains contain β-structure.
Measurement of the ROA spectrum of CT5B provided further evidence
of β-structure (Figure 3c), including the negative band at ∼1220 cm–1,31 the couplet with a negative band at
∼1256 cm–1 and a positive band at ∼1304
cm–1,33,45 and the couplet with
a negative band at ∼1657 cm–1 and a positive
band at ∼1678 cm–1.33 Furthermore, the CD spectra of NT5B, CT5B, and Cys-domain display
minima at ∼216 nm, which is characteristic of the β-sheet
(Figure 4). Taken together,
the Raman, ROA, and CD data presented here indicate that the β-sheet
is a major feature in the “protein-rich” subdomains
of MUC5B. This well-ordered structure of the N- and C-terminal regions
of MUC5B is in agreement with EM and SAXS analysis of these regions,
which have identified their globular shape.8,12−15 The data presented here may indicate that the β-sheet is important
for the functions of these globular regions of mucins, such as in
forming intramolecular and intermolecular interactions that are paramount
for mucin cross-linking and polymerization and thus the integrity
of saliva and mucus gels.

of (a) the N- and (b) the C- terminal regions of MUC5B (NT5B and CT5B,
respectively), and (d) a Cys-domain of MUC5B were expressed and purified,
and their Raman spectra collected at ∼5 mg/mL. CT5B was purified
and concentrated to ∼15 mg/mL and its ROA spectrum measured
(c).

pH 7.4.

Following the Raman/ROA/CD analyses
of the various mucin subdomains,
polymeric MUC5B was analyzed by a novel spectroscopic technique, TERS.
TERS combines the spatial resolution of AFM with the chemical specificity
of Raman spectroscopy, enabling structure features to be examined
along the length of individual molecules. Therefore, we aimed to generate
the first TERS spectra along the length of an individual mucin molecule
and identify signatures of glycosylation and secondary structure.

The AFM topography of an individual MUC5B molecule was visualized
(Figure 5a,b), and
TER spectra were measured every 1 nm along a 90 nm segment of the
molecule (Figure 5c,
and color-map Figure 5d). The spectra have excellent signal-to-noise characteristics and
the complexity is highlighted by the vast array of peak positions
and intensities. This likely reflects both the sensitivity and specificity
of TERS enabling the differentiation of amino acids within a protein
at nanometer resolution17,18 and the structural
complexity/diversity of the mucin molecule.

length of a MUC5B molecule. (a and b) AFM
topography of a single MUC5B molecule; the region identified by the
dotted line is shown in greater detail in part b. (b) AFM topography
of a MUC5B molecule, with the area mapped by TERS shown by the blue
line, starting at the arrow. (c) MUC5B TER spectra, measured every
1 nm along 90 nm of the single MUC5B molecule. Each spectrum was truncated
below 560 cm–1, and the background was electronically
subtracted and normalized to between 0 and 1. The broad region common
to all spectra between 950 and 1000 cm–1 is due
to the overtone band of the silicon of the TERS-tip. (d) Color-map
of MUC5B TER spectra, with peak intensities color-coded (as shown
by the scale bar).

The presence of glycan
chains on the mucin renders the interpretation
of the data set not a trivial task, since the study of even simple
carbohydrates by TERS is in its infancy. Indeed, this is the first
report of TER spectra of such a complex glycoprotein with high spatial
resolution. By collection of the TER spectra of the major monosaccharide
building blocks of mucins (Figure S4),
we generated a library of monosaccharide marker bands (Tables S3 and S4) in order to examine signatures
of glycosylation along the length of the molecule. All sugar marker
bands were identified within the MUC5B TERS data set and show distinct
distribution patterns along the length of the molecule (Figure 6a). This may reflect the glycosylation
of the molecule (i.e., the presence of particular monosaccharides, Table S4), or different orientation of sugars
on the glass substrate, which affects their detection by TERS. At
this stage it is not possible to unequivocally distinguish between
these possibilities; this would be a fruitful area for longer term
study. Despite this, it is striking that monosaccharide marker bands
are displayed throughout the MUC5B TERS data set, suggesting that
the area imaged includes at least part of a highly glycosylated mucin
domain.

Figure 6 Glycosylation and secondary structure signatures along a MUC5B
molecule. (a) Color-maps of monosaccharide marker bands in MUC5B TER
spectra. The appearance and intensity of the marker bands of monosaccharides
at 602, 622, 630, 730, and 913 cm–1 in the MUC5B
TERS data set are shown. A band position allowance of ±5 cm–1 was used. (b) Plot of detected bands assigned to
different secondary structures along the length of the MUC5B TERS
data set. Amide I peaks in each spectrum were assigned as α-helix/unordered
(blue, 1640–1664 cm–1) or β-structure
(red, 1665–1678 cm–1). For the plot band
intensities were not considered.

In recent years TERS has proven to be an effective tool for
investigating
the secondary structure distribution along the lengths of protein
structures. Therefore, we examined the amide I band positions along
the TERS data set of MUC5B. The position of the amide I band was assigned
as α-helix/unordered (1640–1664 cm–1) or β-sheet (1665–1678 cm–1), based
on previous TERS analysis of proteins,17 providing a map of secondary structure signatures along the MUC5B
molecule (Figure 6b).
The plot in Figure 6b shows that α-helix/unordered conformation was identified
in the majority of spectra all along the area imaged. Since our Raman,
ROA, and CD analyses showed that unordered structure is present in
MUC5B O-glycan-rich regions and there is no evidence of α-helical
structure in any of the MUC5B subdomains, this suggests that these
TERS signals originate from unordered conformation rather than α-helix.
This would indicate that the area imaged by TERS includes part of
an extended heavily O-glycosylated region of the mucin, in strong
agreement with the observation of sugar bands along the majority of
the molecule (Figure 6a). Indeed, such regions are reported to be ∼100–150
nm in length.9,46,47 Additionally, among the α-helix/unordered secondary structure
are discrete regions (10–20 nm and 60–90 nm) that contain
β-sheet structure. This may represent a movement of the TERS
tip over a protein-rich subdomain (NT5B, CT5B, or Cys-domain) of MUC5B,
which were found by Raman, ROA, and CD here to possess largely a β-sheet
conformation.

Our discovery of the secondary structures of the
various mucin
subdomains by Raman/ROA/CD has provided a powerful opportunity to
investigate mucin secondary structure along the length of the individual
molecule analyzed here by TERS. However, it must be considered that
there are differences between these techniques and TERS; far field
Raman/ROA/CD detects the core structures of biomolecules, while TERS
is extremely sensitive to structures present on the surface of molecules.
Therefore, although it is likely that the secondary structure signatures
identified in the TERS data set represent the locations of the mucin
subdomains (by correlation with Raman/ROA/CD analysis), it cannot
be ruled out that they may have another local origin, thus an absolute
statement regarding the conformation on the surface from the presented
experiments alone cannot be made at this time.

Here, we present
the first demonstration of TER spectra acquisition
with high spatial resolution along a gel-forming mucin where different
secondary structures and glycosylation signatures can be discerned.
Undoubtedly, more in-depth analysis of these data and additional data
sets may offer more information regarding mucin structure, such as
glycosylation patterns and differentiation of amino acids. Presently,
for the purpose of this manuscript, we have focused on the identification
of signatures of secondary structure and glycosylation.

Going
forward, studies that build upon this work will likely help
to forward the capabilities of Raman spectroscopies. For instance,
elaborate multivariate data analysis, that are beyond the scope of
this manuscript, have recently been demonstrated for the distinction
of a glycosylated protein from the nonglycosylated form.48 Raman spectroscopy and ROA of carbohydrates
are also being advanced by ab initio approaches to
model disaccharides49−51 and potentially will lead to the ability to model
the Raman and ROA spectra of more complex glycoconjugates. Such computational
modeling can also certainly be transmitted to the analysis of the
TER spectra of glycoproteins.

Conclusions
Here, we report the
first measurements of the Raman, ROA, and TER
spectra of a purified, polymeric, gel-forming mucin, MUC5B. The combined
use of Raman, ROA, and CD revealed that polymeric MUC5B has a largely
unordered polypeptide backbone arising from its heavily O-glycosylated
regions, while the substantially less glycosylated subdomains of MUC5B
at the N- and C-terminal regions and central Cys-domains are dominated
by β-sheet. This was extended to the single molecule level,
and we reported the first TER spectra along the length of a single
MUC5B molecule and provided a method to tentatively identify the regions
of secondary structure and areas that are glycosylated. This work
highlights the potential of combined Raman spectroscopies as a strategy
for mapping the secondary structure of complex glycoproteins.
