Rapid
and specific detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) related to drug resistance in infectious diseases is crucial
for accurate prognostics, therapeutics and disease management at point-of-care.
Here, we present a novel amplification method and provide universal
guidelines for the detection of SNPs at isothermal conditions. This
method, called USS-sbLAMP, consists of SNP-based loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (sbLAMP) primers and unmodified self-stabilizing (USS)
competitive primers that robustly delay or prevent unspecific amplification.
Both sets of primers are incorporated into the same reaction mixture,
but always targeting different alleles; one set specific to the wild
type allele and the other to the mutant allele. The mechanism of action
relies on thermodynamically favored hybridization of totally complementary
primers, enabling allele-specific amplification. We successfully validate
our method by detecting SNPs, C580Y and Y493H, in the Plasmodium falciparum kelch 13 gene that are responsible for resistance to artemisinin-based combination
therapies currently used globally in the treatment of malaria. USS-sbLAMP
primers can efficiently discriminate between SNPs with high sensitivity
(limit of detection of 5 × 101 copies per reaction),
efficiency, specificity and rapidness (<35 min) with the capability
of quantitative measurements for point-of-care diagnosis, treatment
guidance, and epidemiological reporting of drug-resistance.

==== Body
The emergence
of drug resistance
is a constant threat to global public health, limiting the ability
to treat infectious diseases effectively and compromising medical
procedures.1 Rapid detection of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are linked with resistance phenotypes
in infectious pathogens is, therefore, key to improving treatment
efficacy and guiding clinical usage of drugs toward development of
personalized medicine. However, the detection of genetic markers is
still a major challenge for molecular-based diagnostic technologies,
especially for those aiming to be deployed at point-of-care (PoC).

Currently, high-throughput methods such as Next Generation Sequencing
or Sanger sequencing are considered the gold standard for low frequency
allele detection. Despite their advancement in the past decade, their
high cost and time to report results limit their use outside specialized
laboratories.2,3 A variety of PCR-based methods
have been developed to enhance detection of genetic markers. These
allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) techniques can be classified into two
main groups: major allele suppression methods and minor allele enrichment
methods. Within the first group, blocking primers have been designed
to suppress the amplification of the major allele, enabling minor
allele amplification by allele-specific primers. Different approaches
have been reported such as (i) PCR blocking primers with a poly-A
tail of four nucleotides4 or with 3′
end modifications (ddNTPs, carbon-spacer, or inverted DNA nucleotides),5−7 (ii) PCR clamping6 based on the incorporation
of peptide nucleic acids,8 bridged nucleic
acids,9 or locked nucleic acids,10 or (iii) PCR amplification of previously treated
DNA with lambda exonuclease.11 Within the
second group, AS-PCR techniques have focused on enhancing the amplification
of the minor allele12 by the incorporation
of (i) primers specific to the SNP at their 3′ end,13 (ii) primers with mismatches within the four
bases from the 3′ end,14,15 or (iii) primers of
different lengths for melting temperature (Tm) analysis.16 However, the need
of thermal cycling, gel electrophoresis,17 and modified oligonucleotides for validation elevate the time and
cost per sample, preventing these PCR-based methods from being widespread
to decentralized areas.

An alternative to PCR is isothermal
DNA amplification techniques,
which offer nucleic acid synthesis at constant temperature using simpler
and less complex equipment better suited to applications at PoC. Several
isothermal techniques have been reported, each one with its own innovative
characteristics and temperature requirements in the range of 30–65
°C, depending on the enzymes used in the reaction. The most popular
techniques are (i) recombinase polymerase amplification,18 (ii) nucleic acid sequence-based amplification,19 (iii) loop-mediated isothermal amplification
(LAMP),20 and (iv) helicase-dependent amplification.21 Among them, LAMP has become popular due to advantages
such as its high efficiency, high amplification yield, high specificity
due to four to six primers in the reaction, strand displacement DNA
synthesis between 60 and 65 °C, and the capability of visual
detection of products due to precipitation of magnesium pyrophosphate.22,23 Allele-specific LAMP (AS-LAMP) has been previously described for
minor allele amplification. Several approaches have been reported
such as (i) placing the SNP at the 5′ end of overlapped FIP
and BIP primers,24,25 (ii) placing the SNP at the 3′
end of B2 or LB primer,26 or (iii) introducing
additional mismatches.27,28 These methods either delay the
onset of the unspecific reaction, or the time-to-positive (TTP) of
the specific reaction is too late such that their applicability is
limited to test high concentrated samples. Each design is unique and
target dependent, preventing their standardization across other relevant
SNPs. The addition of universal QProbe29 or the utilization of the Taq Mut enzyme30 have addressed this to an extent, however, the
need of melting analysis, complex primer design, or low specificity
prevent the use of these methods at the PoC.

Here, we describe
a new method and propose universal primer design
guidelines for enhanced SNP detection at isothermal conditions based
on (i) SNP-based loop-mediated isothermal amplification (sbLAMP) primers,
which consist of six primers targeting eight different regions, with
two of them responsible for AS-LAMP amplification, and (ii) the novel
unmodified self-stabilizing (USS) competitive primers, complementary
to the SNP at their 5′ end, which are responsible for robustly
delaying or preventing unspecific sbLAMP amplification. In contrast
to conventional blocking PCR primers, which present 3′ end
modifications, the proposed USS primers are chemically unmodified
with capability to extend (higher stability) and compete with other
primers and intermediate amplified structures in the reaction. We
demonstrate successful application of our method, defining universal
primer design guidelines based on the detection of the SNP C580Y located in the gene kelch 13 (K13) of the AT-rich genome of P. falciparum responsible for resistance to artemisinin-based drug treatment of
malaria.31,32 As validation, the same principles were
used to develop USS-sbLAMP primers for detection of another antimalarial-resistant K13 SNP, Y493H. The proposed method has
shown high sensitivity, efficiency, specificity and rapid TTP (<35
min) for SNP detection, and it is also applicable to mixed populations.
The primer design guidelines we provide at the end of each section
aim to give a foundation for the design of new USS-sbLAMP primer sets
for the detection of other relevant targets. Diagnostic tests incorporating
the proposed isothermal chemistry will greatly expand the capability
of rapid SNP screening, including in limited-resource settings (LRS)
where rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostics of infectious diseases
are of vital importance.

Experimental Section
Primer Design of USS-sbLAMP
Specific to SNP C580Y and SNP Y493H
The USS-sbLAMP method consists
of a total of eight primers targeting ten distinct regions of the
DNA template. The sbLAMP primer set is composed of two outer primers
(F3 and B3), two loop primers (LF and LB) and two inner primers (sbFIP
and sbBIP), where F1c and B1c locate the SNP at their 5′ end.
The USS primer set consists of a forward blocking competitive primer
(FB) and a backward blocking competitive primer (BB). The USS-sbLAMP
primer sets for the specific detection of C580Y and Y493H were designed based on the gene K13 of P. falciparum. Consensus reference
genomic sequences from all human-infective Plasmodium species (PF3D7_1343700.1, PFIT_1342900, PKNH_1257700, PKNOH_S09541100, PVP01_1211100, PVX_083080, PmUG01_12021200, POcGH01_12019400) were
retrieved from Plasmodium Genomic Resource (PlasmoDB)33 and aligned using MUSCLE algorithm34 in Geneious 10.0.5 software.35 The sbLAMP
primer set was designed using Primer Explorer V5 (Eiken Chemical Co.
Ltd., Tokyo, Japan; http://primerexplorer.jp/lampv5e/index.html) and optimized manually to locate the SNP at the 5′ end of
F1c and B1c, following the method described by Eiken Chemical Co.,
Ltd.,24 with the novelty of considering
the local GC% composition for the design of FIP and BIP primers, named
as sbFIP and sbBIP. Different lengths of F1c and B1c were designed
for the SNP C580Y (17 bp, 19 bp, 21 bp, and 25 bp
for F1c, and 21 bp, 25 bp, 27 bp, and 29 bp for B1c) and for the SNP Y493H (21 bp for F1c and 17 bp for B1c). The USS primer
sets were designed based on the most suitable pair of F1c and B1c
for allele-specific amplification based on experimental data (see Results and Discussion). FB and BB primers of different
lengths were manually designed, always equal or longer than the selected
F1c and B1c. They were between 0 and 6 bp longer at the 3′
end (additional 0 to −3.93 kcal/mol–1) and
locate the SNP within the 3 bp (up to −1.31 kcal/mol–1) closer to their 5′ end (FB0, FB1, FB2 and BB0, BB1 and BB2),
where the number indicates the position of the SNP from the 5′
end. To investigate the performance of the competitive primers, reverse-complementary
primers to FB/BB, named FA/BA, were designed, and 3′ end modifications
(/3AmMo/) were added to each primer set, named FA*/BA* and FB*/BB*.
All primers used in this paper can be found in Table S1 and final USS-sbLAMP primer sets in Table S2.

USS-sbLAMP Mechanism
The incorporation
of USS primers
in the sbLAMP reaction enhances allele discrimination by preventing
unspecific sbLAMP amplification (caused by unspecific sbLAMP primers)
through thermodynamically favored hybridization to the template due
to total complementarity and self-stabilizing capability. USS primers
and sbFIP/sbBIP primers (within sbLAMP) are in the same reaction mixture
but always targeting different alleles, one set specific to the wild
type (WT) allele and the other to the mutant (MT) allele. Allelic
discrimination is possible by comparing the outcome of two independent
reactions: WT reaction (sbLAMPWT and USSMT primers)
and MT reaction (sbLAMPMT and USSWT primers),
as shown in Scheme 1. sbLAMP follows the LAMP method described by Notomi et al.20 It is initiated by the binding of two inner
primers sbFIP (F1c-F2) and sbBIP (B1c-B2), which bind to F2c and B2c
regions, respectively, leaving F1c and B1c free. Two outer primers
F3 and B3 displace the strands, releasing single-stranded DNA (ssDNA).
The free F1c and B1c form a dumbbell-like structure by annealing to
their complementary sequences F1 and B1, respectively. It is rapidly
linearized from its 3′ end, and the binding of sbFIP and sbBIP
initiate the cyclic amplification step. During this step, LF and LB
primers bind their complementary sequences, which are in between B1c
and B2c and F1 and F2, further accelerating the reaction.36

Scheme 1 Mechanism of USS-sbLAMP in the Presence
of Mutant DNA
As an example, mutant (MT)
DNA presents allele A and it is uniquely amplified within the MT reaction
(sbLAMPMT and USSWT primers). Amplification
of the MT DNA within the wild type (WT) reaction (sbLAMPWT and USSMT primers) is significantly delayed or prevented
by the annealing of complementary USSMT primers to the
template.

The complementarity of the USS primers
to the target template (with
SNP specificity) suggests the possibility of hybridization during
the initiation stage of sbLAMP, causing a general delay in specific
and unspecific reactions until USS primers are displaced by F3/B3
and sbFIP/sbBIP (F2 and B2, specifically). At the end of the initiation
stage, the annealing of the USS primers to the template and the formation
of the dumbbell-like structure with the binding of sbFIP and sbBIP
cannot occur simultaneously. Consequently, there will be a competition
and the most energetically favorable reaction, the specific reaction,
will occur at a first stage. In case that the DNA template is not
specific to the sequence of the USS primers, they may anneal, but
the 5′ end will be unbound leaving a toehold for loop formation
and subsequent amplification by specific sbLAMP primers. If the DNA
template is specific to the sequence of the USS primers, a second
stage will take place. The association between the USS primers and
the template is not transient and a highly stable primer-template
complex is formed as nucleotides are incorporated by the DNA polymerase.
FB will anneal to the B1 region of the dumbbell-like structure preventing
the annealing between B1 and B1c regions of this structure (this 3′
end cannot act as a primer) and the annealing of B2 of the BIP primer
to the B2c region of the dumbbell-like structure; BB will anneal to
the F1 region of the dumbbell-like structure preventing the annealing
between F1 and F1c regions of this structure (this 3′ end cannot
act as a primer) and the annealing of F2 of the FIP primer to the
F2c region of the dumbbell-like structure. This self-stabilizing behavior
will create byproducts that do not prime amplification and, therefore,
will inhibit the formation of dumbbell-like structures preventing
unspecific amplification.

The hybridization energies of specific
FB/BB must be favorable
with respect to the energies of unspecific F1c/B1c, ΔG°(F1c/B1c) > ΔG°(FB/BB). To achieve that, the design of USS primers
followed
two principles: primer elongation along the 3′ end and displacement
of the position of the SNP from their 5′ end. Regarding the
first principle, FB/BB primers should be equal or longer than F1c/B1c.
Overlapping with the 5′ end of LF and LB must be minimum (1–2
bp) and preferably avoided, although it might be tolerated since only
one of the USS primers will be slightly compromised (some mismatches
with the template, although it might be able to bind because the region
is free) when preventing the formation of the dumbbell structure.
Since USS primers should not delay the TTP, their free energy values
should not exceed in more than 10 kcal mol–1 the
free energy values of F1c/B1c. Regarding the second principle, placing
the SNP slightly away from the 5′ end of USS primers might
enhance their specificity due to the fact that a local region around
the SNP will be opened or closed based on their complementarity at
the SNP position. Depending on the sequence of the target, placing
the SNP at their 5′ end could be the most optimum configuration.

Thermodynamic Calculations of USS-sbLAMP Primers
Possible
secondary structures, primer dimer formation, and hybridization stability
were checked using NUPACK37 and NetPrimer
(Premier Biosoft, NetPrimer; https://www.premierbiosoft.com/netprimer/). Equations38−40 can be found in Table S3 and obtained ΔG° values in Tables S4, S7, S9, and S11.

Samples and
DNA Extraction Methods
Two gBlock Gene
fragments of 607 bp were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies
(Table S2) and resuspended in TE buffer
to 5 ng/μL stock solutions (stored at −20 °C). The
WT synthetic DNA template (named here as WT template) contained SNPs 580C and 493Y; the MT synthetic DNA template
(named here as MT template) contained the corresponding drug-resistant
mutations, 580Y and 493H. P. falciparum genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated using
the PureLink Genomic DNA Mini Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) from Cambodian
and Thai culture adapted asexual parasites harboring the WT K13 allele (ANL1 and ARN1G, respectively), a Thai isolate
harboring K13 539T mutation (APS2G), a Cambodian
isolate containing K13 493H mutation (ANL8G), and
a Cambodian isolate with K13 580Y mutation (ANL5G). P. ovale curtisi, P. ovale wallikeri, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. knowlesi clinical isolates
(gDNA) were kindly provided by Prof. Colin Sutherland. The samples
were stored at −20 °C until experiments were performed.

USS-sbLAMP Reaction Conditions
Two independent reactions,
WT reaction and MT reaction, were performed with each target. Each
reaction mixture contained the following: 1.5 μL of 10×
isothermal buffer, 0.9 μL of MgSO4 (100 mM stock),
2.1 μL of dNTPs (10 mM stock), 0.375 μL of BSA (20 mg/mL
stock), 2.4 μL of Betaine (5 M stock), 0.375 μL of SYTO
9 Green (20 μM stock), 0.6 μL of Bst 2.0
DNA polymerase (8,000 U/mL stock), 3 μL of different concentrations
of synthetic DNA or gDNA, 1.5 μL of 10× sbLAMP primer mixture
(20 μM sbBIP/sbFIP, 10 μM LF/LB, and 2.5 μM B3/F3),
and enough nuclease-free water (ThermoFisher Scientific) to bring
the volume to 15 μL. All reagents were purchased to New England
BioLabs and all synthetic DNA to Integrated DNA Technologies. Reactions
were performed at 63 °C for 50 min for screening purposes and
30–35 min for final assays. For high resolution melting, SYTO
9 Green was replaced by EvaGreen (Biotium, California) at a final
concentration of 0.6 μM and one cycle was performed at 95 °C
for 60 s, 40 °C for 60 s, 65 °C for 1 s, and 97 °C
for 1 s (Figure S1). Experiments were performed
twice, and each condition was run in triplicates (5 μL each
reaction) loading the reactions into LightCycler 480 Multiwell Plates
96 (Roche Diagnostics) utilizing a LightCycler 96 Real-Time PCR System
(Roche Diagnostics). Competitive primers (FA/BA, FA*/BA*, FB/BB, or
FB*/BB*) were incorporated into the sbLAMP 10× primer mixture
at different final concentrations: 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, and
4.5 μM. Nuclease-free water was adjusted to bring the volume
to 15 μL. sbLAMP and USS primers were purchased from Integrated
DNA Technologies and resuspended in nuclease-free water to 100 and
400 μM stock solutions, respectively. The solutions were stored
at 4 °C.

Sensitivity of USS-sbLAMP Method
Sensitivity was evaluated
using 10-fold serial dilutions of synthetic DNA: 5 × 104, 5 × 103, 5 × 102, and 5 ×
101 copies/reaction. Standard curves were generated by
plotting the TTP against copies/reaction with errors at one standard
deviation. Sensitivity of mixed populations was evaluated by spiking
synthetic DNA harboring the WT allele and the MT allele at different
ratios (100/0, 80/20, 50/50. 20/80, and 0/100, in percentages) from
stock solution at 2.5 × 103 copies/reaction.

Cross-Reactivity
of USS-sbLAMP Method and Detection of Clinical
Isolates
Ten clinical isolates (gDNA) were used to evaluate
the feasibility of USS-sbLAMP and to prove the absence of cross-reactivity
with any other human-infective Plasmodium species. Samples included P. ovale curtisi, P. ovale wallikeri, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. knowlesi (2 samples), P. falciparum harboring WT K13 alleles
(2 samples), P. falciparum harboring
the MT allele 580Y, 493H, and 539T allele (3 different samples). Experiments were performed
as described above.

Statistical Analysis
Data is presented
as mean TTP
± standard deviation; p-values were calculated
by Student’s heteroscedastic t-test, with a two-sided distribution.
Statistically significant difference was considered as *p-value < 0.05, **p-value < 0.01, ***p-value < 0.001, ****p-value < 0.0001;
k-means cluster analysis and ANOVA test were performed in Origin software
(OriginLab, Northampton, MA).

Results and Discussion
sbLAMP
Method
Different lengths of F1c and B1c were
designed in order to study the impact of local GC% content, Tm and primer length in (i) allele-specificity
and (ii) TTP. The design of overlapping primers for allele detection
is not trivial, and the dissimilarity of the sequence in terms of
ACTG composition upstream and downstream the position of the SNP should
be taken into account. In general, primers are equal in length (23–24
bp)24 and are considered specific and stable
as long as they present optimal GC% content and Tm to anneal to the DNA template.41 Due to the fact that the GC% content and Tm are different at local regions with respect to the position
of the SNP, allele-specific primers sbFIP and sbBIP might be of different
lengths. F1c and B1c of four different lengths each (Table S1) were designed with hybridization energies considered
between −10.00 and −23.00 kcal mol–1 (Table S4), increasing proportionally
to the length of the primers and the GC%. Real-time amplification
experiments of WT (Figure 1A) and MT (Figure 1B) templates were performed independently. Two independent
reactions, WT specific (sbLAMPWT) and MT specific (sbLAMPMT), were tested with each template. A total of 16 combinations
of F1c-B1c were performed; F1c of 17, 19, 21, and 25 bp and B1c of
21, 25, 27, and 29 bp. For both DNA templates, the TTP of specific
and unspecific reactions was reduced as B1c was elongated from 21
to 29 bp, and allele-specific detection was enhanced as F1c was shortened
from 25 to 17 bp.

primer lengths. (A) Comparison

reactions below 20 min are blue shadowed. ΔTTP values above
2 min are orange colored. Average of two experiments performed in
triplicates using 5 × 104 copies/reaction of synthetic
DNA. Selected sbLAMP primer sets are indicated with arrows in the
plots and dark blue cells in the table.

The amplification time difference (ΔTTP) between specific
and unspecific reactions with each template is presented in Figure 1C. Detailed TTP values
of all reactions are reported in Table S5. The results in Figure 1 showed the existence of a critical length for B1c (>27
bp)
at which the TTP was significantly reduced (highlighted in blue).
Two highly significant clusters were obtained by performing k-means
cluster analysis and ANOVA test of sbLAMP results of WT and MT templates
(P > F = 4.44 × 10–15 and P > F = 1.53 × 10–14, respectively). The selected sbLAMP primer sets
according to the highest ΔTTP were F1c17-B1c27 for both alleles (indicated by arrows in Figure 1A,B, and dark blue cells in Figure 1C).

Guideline
1
Allele-specificity and TTP were significantly
enhanced by modifying the length of F1c and B1c with respect to the
standard sizes. It is recommended to design allele-specific primers
of different lengths depending on the GC% content at the local region.
Shortening the primer that sits at the richer GC% region proved to
enhance allele-specificity (preferably not less than 13 bp, i.e. −8.52
kcal mol–1). Elongating the primer that sits at
the richer AT% region with respect to the other primer equalized their
free energy values and Tm (even favoring
the primer that sits at the richer AT% region) such that both primers
performed properly (early TTP). For optimal performance (allele-specificity
and early TTP) more than 15 bp difference (−9.83 kcal mol–1) between F1c and B1c should be avoided.

Incorporation
of USS Primers for Enhancement of sbLAMP
USS primers were
incorporated into the sbLAMP reaction at 2 μM
to prevent unspecific sbLAMP amplification. FB and BB of different
lengths (FB of 27, 29, 31, and 33 bp and BB of 17, 19, 21, and 23
bp) were designed (Table S1) and a total
of 15 different combinations were tested. Real-time amplification
experiments of WT and MT templates were performed independently. Two
independent reactions, WT reaction (sbLAMPWT and USSMT), and MT reaction (sbLAMPMT and USSWT), were tested with each template. The TTP of specific reactions
are shown in the lower section of Figure 2A and the TTP of unspecific reactions in
the upper section. Detailed TTP values can be found in Table S6. As the length of USS primers is increased
unspecific reactions are significantly delayed, while specific reactions
are slightly delayed. Consequently, there is a trade-off between allele-specificity
and sensitivity. The length of BB had a higher impact on the delay
of both reactions than the length of FB. This behavior might be attributed
to the richer GC% content of the BB region and hence, the free energy
hybridization values (Table S7). In general,
USS primers must be within an optimal length range, and results of
both templates, WT and MT, must be interpreted as a whole to select
the most suitable USS primer set. The criterion for the selection
of the most optimal size of FB/BB was based on (i) minimizing the
TTP of the specific reactions and (ii) maximizing the TTP of the unspecific
reactions. Because both criteria cannot be fulfilled by any USS primer
set, a balance is considered as the optimal. The selected lengths
were USSWT FB27/BB21 and USSMT FB33/BB21. The ΔTTP between
specific and unspecific reactions was statistically significant (****p-value) for both templates, WT and MT.

experiments performed in triplicates using 5 × 104 copies/reaction of synthetic DNA. Negative control (NC), no addition
of USS primers.

To enhance allele-specificity,
the selected FB/BB primers were
redesigned to locate the SNP at three different positions from their
5′ end (5′X···3′ named as FB0/BB0,
5′NX···3′ named as FB1/BB1, and 5′NNX···3′
named as FB2/BB2 where X denoted the SNP) by adding nucleotides totally
complementary to the DNA template (Table S1). A total of nine different combinations were tested. Detailed TTP
values can be found in Table S8. According
to the estimated free energy values presented in Table S9, as far as the SNP is displaced away from the 5′
end, the specific hybridization is favored due to enhanced primer
stability (additional −0.66 to −1.31 kcal mol–1). However, the risk of creating an internal bulge between unspecific
USS primers and the DNA template prevents to locate the SNP far from
the third position (i.e., FB2/BB2) from the 5′ end of FB/BB
primers. TTP of specific reactions were not significantly affected
by the incorporation of the redesigned USS primers. However, unspecific
reactions were further delayed, contributing to allele-specific detection.
Based on the experimental results obtained in Figure 2B the selected redesigned primers were USSWT FB127/BB221 and USSMT FB233/BB121. The ΔTTP between specific and unspecific
reactions was statistically significant (****p-value)
for both templates, WT and MT.

Guideline 2
The nucleotide sequence
of FB/BB primers
is restricted by the template, and their length is limited by the
5′ end of LF and LB primers. It is recommended that USS primers
are between 0 to 8 bp longer than F1c/B1c primers (additional 0 to
−5.24 kcal mol–1) with GC clamps at their
3′ end, if possible, to favor their stability upon hybridization.
Locating the SNP within the three base pairs closer to their 5′
end (preferably FB1/BB1 or FB2/BB2, meaning an additional −0.66
to −1.31 kcal mol–1) favor specific hybridization
to their target template. Placing the SNP more than 4 bp (additional
−2.62 kcal mol–1) away the 5′ end
should be avoided due to the high risk of internal bulges formation
and unspecific amplification.

Comparison of Modified,
Unmodified, and Reverse Competitive
Primers
Based on the selected USSWT FB127/BB221 and USSMT FB233/BB121 primers, their reverse-complement and the addition of 3′
end modifications were studied. Reverse-complement primers to FB/BB,
named FA/BA, located the SNP at the 3′ end in contrast to FB/BB
which located the SNP at the 5′ end. The 3′ end modified
versions of FB/BB and FA/BA, named FB*/BB* and FA*/BA*, included an
amino modification which prevented the elongation of the primers by
the DNA polymerase. The results presented in Figure 2C showed the similar behavior of the four
primers in combination with sbLAMP. This data proved for the first
time that unmodified primers (FB/BB and FA/BA) can perform similarly
or better for allele-specific detection than modified primers, based
on statistical analysis. t test was performed to
compare the ΔTTP values obtained using modified and unmodified
primers with each template. In the case of the WT template, FB/BB
and FA/BA performed better than their modified versions (p-value **** for both of them). In the case of the MT template, FB/BB
outperformed FB*/BB* (p-value *), but no statistical
significance was observed for FA/BA and FA*/BA*. Regarding the two
sets of unmodified primers, FB/BB presented higher ΔTTP values
than FA/BA. Compared to other strategies based on 3′ end chemical
modifications,14,15,42 and the addition of mismatches at 3′ or 5′ end of
FIP28 or BIP,27 our methodology relies on total complementary unmodified primers
with extension capability. The easier design and the lack of chemical
modifications reduce the cost of the assay and production time, positioning
this method as a promising molecular-based technique for SNP discrimination
to be used at PoC.

Guideline 3
Unmodified primers performed
similarly
or better than 3′ end chemically modified primers to prevent
unspecific amplification by sbLAMP, based on statistical analysis.
The use of FB/BB (SNP placed closed to the 5′ end) is recommended
due to higher ΔTTP between specific and unspecific reactions,
easier design and lower cost and production time.

Study of Different
Concentrations of USS Primers
The
selected USSWT FB127/BB221 and USSMT FB233/BB121 primers were added to
the sbLAMP reaction mix at different concentrations: 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5,
3, 3.5, 4, and 4.5 μM. Real-time amplification experiments of
WT and MT templates were performed independently. For each template,
WT and MT reactions were tested (Figure 2D,E). Specific reactions were slightly delayed
as the concentration of the USS primers was increased. The TTP values
followed a linear fit with slopes of 0.76 and 1.48 for the WT and
the MT template, respectively. Although the unspecific reactions also
followed a linear fit, their slopes were sharper, denoting the significance
of the concentration of FB/BB on delaying unspecific amplification.
The TTP of specific and unspecific reactions was evaluated to discern
the optimum concentration of USS primers for allele discrimination.
Analyzing all the combinations of different concentrations, the one
presenting the highest ΔTTP for both templates without compromising
the other was selected as the optimum (Table S10). Selected concentrations were USSWT at 3 μM and
USSMT at 4 μM.

Guideline 4
The concentration of
USS primers in the
reaction mixture should be higher (preferably between 1.5× to
2.5×) than the concentrations of sbFIP and sbBIP, to not compromise
the limit of the detection of sbLAMP.

Sensitivity of USS-sbLAMP
Method
Sensitivity was tested
using 10-fold serial dilutions (5 × 104, 5 ×
103, 5 × 102, and 5 × 101 copies/reaction) of WT and MT templates independently (Figure 3A,C) for detection
of SNP C580Y. Amplification curves are presented
in Figure S2. For both alleles, the detection
limit was 5 × 101 copies/reaction within 30 min. Standard
curves were generated with R2 values of
0.989 and 0.975, for WT and MT template, respectively, denoting the
ability of the assay to robustly quantify samples. Pure WT and MT
templates at concentrations below 5 × 103 and 5 ×
104 copies/reaction, respectively, were uniquely amplified
by their corresponding specific reactions providing “yes/no”
results. Sensitivity of sbLAMP was not disrupted by the incorporation
of the USS primers, and amplification of the nontarget template was
successfully delayed or inhibited. Two reactions are always assessed
(WT and MT reactions) for each sample, providing two TTP values being
one of them negative at certain sample concentration (samples can
be diluted if needed). Consequently, having always two reactions ensures
the high specificity of the assay. Amplification was performed in
less than 30 min at low DNA copies/reaction indicating the rapidness
achieved utilizing the USS-sbLAMP method compared to other techniques
based on PCR thermal cycling such as molecular beacons, TaqMan or
FRET,43,44 which require complex designs, more than
1 h to finish and usually postamplification analysis. Other reported
isothermal assays usually need between 20 to 75 min to finish,45,46 do not report quantitative data,47 rely
on the addition of probes (Au NPs) to enhance specificity,48 lack amplification data at low concentrations,26 or require sequencing for product specificity.49

Validation of the USS-sbLAMP Method with
the Artemisinin-Resistant
SNP Y493H
Following the above created guidelines
for the design of USS-sbLAMP primers, a specific USS-sbLAMP primer
set was developed to detect a second K13 SNP, Y439H (Table S2). USSMT-sbLAMPWT primer set consisted of F1c21-B1c17 + FB224/BB126 at 4.5 μM and
USSWT-sbLAMPMT primer set consisted of F1c21-B1c17 + FB124/BB026 at
4.5 μM. Primer properties and hybridization energies are provided
in Table S11. Sensitivity was tested using
10-fold serial dilutions (5 × 104, 5 × 103, 5 × 102, and 5 × 101 copies/reaction)
of WT and MT templates independently (Figure 3B,C). Amplification curves are presented
in Figure S3. For both alleles, the limit
of detection was 5 × 101 copies/reaction within 35
min. Standard curves were generated with R2 values of 0.994 and 0.996, for WT and MT template. Pure WT and MT
templates at concentrations below 5 × 104 copies/reaction
and 5 × 105 copies/reaction, respectively, were uniquely
amplified by their corresponding specific reactions.

Study of the
USS-sbLAMP Method in Mixed Populations Harboring
SNPs C580Y and Y493H
USS-sbLAMP
primer sets for allele-specific detection of SNP C580Y and SNP Y493H were evaluated with spiked mixed
populations at different ratios (100/0, 80/20, 50/50, 20/80, and 0/100,
in percentages). The four alleles were clearly discriminated within
their respective specific reactions, as shown in Table 1. Unspecific reactions did not
amplify, demonstrating the specificity of the method considering mixed
populations at 80/20% as the limit for this experiment.

Cross-Validation of USS-sbLAMP Method for Detection of SNP C580Y and SNPY493H Using Clinical Isolates
The specificity of USS-sbLAMP for detecting SNP C580Y and Y493H was tested using gDNA samples from all
human-infective Plasmodium species: P. falciparum, P. ovale curtisi, P. ovale wallikeri, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. knowlesi, to prove the absence
of cross-reactivity with any of them. In addition, three different P. falciparum samples harboring the mutations 580Y, 493H, and 539T were
tested. There was no cross-reactivity with any of the human-infective Plasmodium species (Table 2). The sample harboring the 539R mutation was uniquely amplified by the WT reactions 580C and 493Y, denoting the high specificity achieved
by the MT reactions 580Y and 493H, which only amplified the samples harboring their respective mutations.

Conclusion
The
proposed USS-sbLAMP method achieves high sensitivity, efficiency,
specificity, and rapidness (TTP < 35 min) for the detection of
SNPs at isothermal conditions suitable for PoC applications. For the
first time here, judiciously designed sbLAMP primers for allele-specific
amplification are combined with novel unmodified self-stabilizing
(USS) competitive primers specific to the SNP at their 5′ end
which robustly delay or prevent unspecific sbLAMP amplification. The
special design, based on the local GC% content at the SNP position
enhanced allele specificity, and the superior concentration of USS
primers suppressed significantly unspecific amplification offering
an excellent linear working range with a limit of detection of 5 ×
101 copies/reaction for the detection of two of the most
important artemisinin-resistant SNPs C580Y and Y493H within 30 and 35 min, respectively. This universal
isothermal method uses chemically unmodified primers totally complementary
to the target template except at the SNP position (either wild-type
or mutant allele), which significantly reduces the cost of reagents
and equipment avoiding the need of thermal cycling and electrophoresis
for product validation. The guidelines we provide aim to enable others
to develop their own USS-sbLAMP primer sets to detect any kind of
SNP, which can relate to drug resistance, disease susceptibility or
cancer development. Diagnostic platforms that use CMOS-based ISFET
electrochemical biosensors,51,52 which identify targets
using pH-based nucleic acid amplification, will perfectly couple with
the USS-sbLAMP method described here, with efforts currently underway
to integrate these. Any diagnostic device that can incorporate the
proposed method will greatly expand the capability of rapid SNP screening
at PoC, including LRS where infectious disease diagnosis and rapid
drug resistance screening are urgently needed.
