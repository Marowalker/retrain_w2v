Low secondary ion yields from organic
and biological molecules
are the principal limitation on the future exploitation of time of
flight-secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) as a surface and
materials analysis technique. On the basis of the hypothesis that
increasing the density of water related fragments in the ion impact
zone would enhance proton mediated reactions, a prototype water cluster
ion beam has been developed using supersonic jet expansion methodologies
that enable ion yields using a 10 keV (H2O)1000+ beam to be compared with those obtained using a 10 keV
Ar1000+ beam. The ion yields from four standard
compounds, arginine, haloperidol, DPPC, and angiotensin II, have been
measured under static+ and high ion dose conditions. Ion yield enhancements
relative to the argon beam on the order of 10 or more have been observed
for all the compounds such that the molecular ion yield per a 1 μm
pixel can be as high as 20, relative to 0.05 under an argon beam.
The water beam has also been shown to partially lift the matrix effect
in a 1:10 mixture of haloperidol and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine
(DPPC) that suppresses the haloperidol signal. These results provide
encouragement that further developments of the water cluster beam
to higher energies and larger cluster sizes will provide the ion yield
enhancements necessary for the future development of TOF-SIMS.

==== Body
Time of flight-secondary
ion
mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) is now widely applied as a technique
for the surface characterization of a wide range of technological
and biological materials1.2 However, despite the introduction of metal cluster ion
beams that have enabled higher yields with good spatial resolution
although under static conditions (less than 1% of the surface can
be used for analysis)3 and polyatomic primary
beams such as SF5+, C60+, and Arn+ (n = 500 to ∼5000)
that deliver analysis with much lower levels of bombardment induced
damage that have moved TOF-SIMS analysis out of the static regime
enabling depth profiling and 3D imaging,4,5 ion yields
are still severely limited by the very low level of the ionization
probability. The very best that can be hoped for bio-organic molecules
under normal conditions is 10–4, with 10–5 and 10–6 being more normal.6 Consequently, under static conditions with an ion yield
of 10–5 and instrument transmission of 10%, only
∼0.01 molecules (assuming a molecular size of 1 nm3) are available for detection from a 1 μm2 ×
10 nm pixel of a pure compound. Even if analysis can go beyond static
and can collect all the emitted ions from the pixel, only 1 would
be available. Things are potentially better if a whole 1 μm
voxel is consumed and everything can be collected; then, in principle,
we would have 1000 ions for analysis. This capability requires an
analytical process able to collect all or most of the ions generated
from a pixel or voxel. However, it is not practical for the pulsed
beam TOF-SIMS instruments to take advantage of this potential, and
although an instrument that collects most of a continuous beam of
ions generated from a sample has been developed in the form of the
J105 Chemical Imager,7 analysis and imaging
beyond 1 μm with good chemical identification is still limited
in most situations. It is evident that there is enormous potential
for increasing sensitivity and, thus, the range of application of
SIMS if some method could be found to increase the ion yields by a
factor of 10 to 100.

A wide range of methods has been investigated
over the years to
try to increase secondary ion yields. The earliest was depositing
analytes on silver foil that increased ion yields from some compounds
via the formation of [M + Ag]+ ions.8 However, many analytes cannot be dispersed on a foil or
film, and the approach is clearly unsuitable for imaging application.
Other approaches have been to disperse silver or gold nanoparticles
or MALDI type matrices on the samples.9−11 A degree of success
in increasing [M + metal] or [M + H] ion yields has been obtained
but rarely above a factor of 5 increase. The successes of these approaches
have been quite sample specific, and once the additive is sputtered
away, its benefits are lost. Since the advent of polyatomic beams,
it has been observed that water in the sample, present either adventitiously
or as a consequence of freezing the analyte in an ice can, under bombardment
by C60+, gives rise to enhanced [M + H]+ yields.12−14 Enhancements in the range of 10 to 100 have been
reported, but only very few molecules have been studied. These observations
have been complemented by a study in which water was admitted to the
analysis chamber just above the analyte15.16 An enhancement of 10× in the
molecular ion of Irgafos 168 was observed with smaller increases for
polymers. Using D2O, it has been suggested that these enhancements
are associated with protonation activity in the presence of surface
water, possibly as a consequence of the formation of H3O+ in the bombardment region. Such a suggestion accords
with the phenomenon underlying proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry
(PTRMS) and selected ion flow tube MS (SIFTMS), usually used to detect
organics in the atmosphere.17,18 Because the proton
affinity of most organic molecules is higher than that of water, 691
kJ/mol, H3O+ is highly reactive to many organic
analytes such that the kinetics are determined by the collision rates
and significant protonated ion yields are obtained. On the basis of
this thinking, we are in the process of developing a water cluster
primary ion beam by ionization of a neutral cluster formed by supersonic
jet expansion (as distinct from an electrospray type method19,20) using a similar methodology as for argon cluster beams.21−23 The hypothesis being that, in addition to benefits of enhanced low
damage sputtering by a large cluster beam, sputtering with such a
beam will generate a high density of water molecules and fragments
in the emission zone that will enhance the formation of [M + H] ions
and possibly [M – H] ions. If the density of proton donating
species can be made high enough, ion yields might saturate to a relatively
uniform level and this may have the benefit of ameliorating the other
bugbear of SIMS and other desorption mass spectrometries, the matrix
effect.

Comparing TOF-SIMS Spectra from 10 keV Ar1000+ and (H2O)1000+ Results
This Letter reports on initial data from our prototype water beam
system based on a previous argon beam design23 that has been mounted on the J105 TOF-SIMS instrument.7 This very preliminary data shows that, relative
to yields obtained from 10 keV Ar1000+, [M +
H]+ ion yields from arginine, [Asn1 Val5] angiotensin II, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), and
the drug haloperidol using singly charged 10 keV (H2O)1000+ are all enhanced by ∼10× or more.
Further experimental details can be found in the online Supporting Information.

In Figure 1, the positive ion SIMS spectra
from the lipid DPPC obtained using Ar1000+ and
(H2O)1000+ primary beams under 1
× 1011 ions cm–2 dose conditions
are compared. These analysis conditions are somewhat above static,
resulting in the removal of 5% to 10% of the surface volume sampled
(termed static+). Broadly, the spectra obtained are very similar.
There are two obvious differences: first, the ion yields under water
bombardment compared to argon are very significantly increased, m/z 184 by a factor 16 and [M + H]+m/z 735 by a factor 17.
Second, the ratio of the [M + H]+ to the [M + Na]+ peaks has reversed, from 0.7 under argon to 2.0 under water. It
is clear that water bombardment has a profound effect on the ion formation
process and, while all ion yields are enhanced, protonation is favored.
Figure 2 summarizes the data obtained from
all the samples under the same dose conditions. In all cases, the
enhancement relative to argon is around 10 or more. DPPC and haloperidol
show the highest enhancements of close to 20; indeed, in the case
of haloperidol, the yield of the [M + H]+, m/z 376 ion was so high the detector system was saturated.
Hence, we have plotted the lower [M – OH]+ species
at m/z 358.

ion dose of 1 × 1011 ions
cm–2; (b) acquired with 10 keV (H2O)1000+ with ion dose of 1 × 1011 ions
cm–2.

Figure 2 (a) Comparison of signal intensity of 10 keV (H2O)1000+ and 10 keV Ar1000+ for

(DPPC), and [Asn1 Val5] Angio(tensin II).

The yield enhancement of [M +
H]+ from angiotensin II
is almost exactly 10. The enhancement of the fragment ions follows
quite closely the enhancement of the molecular ion. For example, m/z 254, which is the b2-NH3 fragment, is also enhanced by a factor 10. This seems to
be true for most of the molecules we have studied. The fragment to
molecular ion ratio is very similar under both beams. This behavior
would be expected if the water beam predominantly enhances the yield
of the [M + H]+ ion and most fragment formation results
from fragmentation of this ion. Very early24,25 and recent MSMS studies from this laboratory would support this
expectation. It is not true for all fragment ions, e.g., the m/z 95 from haloperidol where the ratio
changes from ∼0.4 under argon to ∼0.2 under water. This
may cast light on a changing mechanism of fragmentation with the involvement
of water fragments in the near surface region.

It is interesting
that the water cluster analysis of a second DPPC
sample that had a higher yield of [M + Na]+ under the argon
beam showed only a 10× enhancement of the [M + H]+ ion, and the [M + Na]+/[M + H]+ ratio which
was about 1.0 under argon did not change. The interference of alkali
metal ions in the formation of protonated secondary ions has been
studied in this laboratory, and this work shows that salt can inhibit
the formation of these [M + H]+ ions26,27 As in these earlier studies, the present results might suggest that
the extent of salt inhibition is concentration related.

Although
at this stage we have not carried out detailed depth profiling
or sputter yield measurement, all of the samples were subjected to
extended sputtering under water cluster bombardment up to a dose of
about 1.7 × 1012 ions cm–2. For
most of the samples, the signal profiles up to this dose were quite
stable. Assuming a molecular volume of about 1 nm3 and
a sputter yield of ∼50 to 100 molecules per primary impact,28 the 1.7 × 1012 ions cm–2 dose is well beyond the static limit and almost all the molecules
in a 1 μm2 × 10 nm surface volume will be removed.
In light of our interest in subμm analysis, Table 1 compares the number of molecular secondary ions detected
under our instrumental conditions from a 1 μm2 surface
using the argon and water beams under the static+ dose of 1 ×
1011 ions cm–2 and when the whole surface
layer is sputtered by 1.7 × 1012 ions cm–2 and most of the resulting secondary ions are collected.

Table 1 Comparison of the Number of Detectable
“Molecular” Secondary Ions from a 1 μm2 Area under Static+ and Whole Area Analysis Conditions Using 10 keV
Ar1000+ and 10 keV (H2O)1000+ Primary Beams
 	static+ conditions (1 × 1011 ions cm–2)	whole 1 μm2 area consumed	
compound	argon	water	argon	water	
arginine m/z 175	0.17	1.4	2.6	21.0	
haloperidol m/z 358	0.06	1.3	0.9	13.4	
DPPC m/z 184	0.033	0.55	0.51	6.4	
DPPC m/z 735	0.001	0.02	0.02	0.24	
angiotensin
II m/z 1032	0.09	0.84	1.09	6.5	
It
is clear that the yields/1 μm2 under our static+
conditions are around 5 to 10 times the expectations for strict static
conditions. Given ionization probabilities in the order of 10–5, they are in line with the higher ion dose. The present
water beam improves the situation by a factor of 10, but the ability
to accumulate all or most of the ions from a given area for analysis
starts to lift the ion yield into a useful region. If the sputter
yield is 50 to 100 per impact, the ionization probability under the
water beam is ≥10–4.

The second major
impetus for these studies was that the use of
water primary beams might modify matrix effects in the case of [M
± H] ions. We have shown that the use of the hydrogen containing
a polyatomic ion beam, coronene C24H12+, can help to lift the matrix effect.29 Previous studies have shown that DPPC exerts a very significant
suppression effect on the formation of the [M + H]+ ion
of haloperidol30.31 As a preliminary study, a 1:10 mixture of haloperidol in DPPC was
prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of the two compounds in
a methanol chloroform mixture and spin-casting the resulting solution
onto a silicon wafer. Figure S.1, Supporting Information, summarizes the outcome of a comparative analysis of this mixture
with the argon and water beams. The expected mixture ratio 0.09YHal/(0.09YHal +
0.091YDPPC) has been calculated using
the observed m/z 358 ion yield from
pure haloperidol, YHal, and the m/z 735 ion yield from pure DPPC, YDPPC, under the argon and water beams. This
is compared with the observed YHalmix/(YHalmix + YDPPCmix) from the mixture. Similar data for DPPC is also presented in Figure
S.1, Supporting Information. It can be
seen that under argon bombardment there is significant suppression
of the haloperidol ion yield ratio by almost 5× from the expected
0.86 down to 0.19 and a corresponding enhancement of DPPC by more
than 6× from 0.13 to 0.81. Under water bombardment however, the
mixture ratio for haloperidol is close to 50% of that expected. In
contrast, the DPPC ratio is still some 5 times higher than expected.
After a dose of 1.7 × 1012 ions cm–2, the relative enhancement for haloperidol is maintained if not somewhat
increased, so surface segregation effects are minimal. It is clear
that, while there is a real benefit under water cluster bombardment,
there is still some way to go to lift the matrix effect entirely.
This suggests that DPPC is still benefiting significantly compared
to haloperidol from the extra protonation capability and that saturation
of protonation species in the emission region has not been reached,
so there is still more benefit to be had if cluster sizes can be increased.

Discussion
and Conclusions
The data we report makes it clear that the
water cluster beam provides
an approximately 10 times or more increase in ion yield for a range
of molecules over the yields observed with 10 keV argon clusters of
the same nuclearity (n = 1000). Under these conditions,
there is also a benefit in a reduced matrix suppression effect. These
observations are consistent with the experimental observations reported
from earlier studies on the benefits of ice matrices and water dosing
of samples that resulted in increased [M + H]+ yields.
Furthermore, MD simulations from Garrison’s group have suggested
that hydrogen species generated by a primary ion impact in the emission
zone may well give rise to protonated molecules that are in a sense
preformed to be sputtered out by subsequent primary particle impacts.32 The data presented in this paper is understandable
in the light of this idea such that a water cluster impact would result
in an increased density of hydrogen, protons, oxygen atoms and ions,
and hydroxyl ions. The resulting ion–molecule reactions in
the emission zone would be those expected to result in increased secondary
ion formation and subsequent release. It would clearly be extremely
interesting to be able to use a D2O cluster beam to clarify
the mechanisms of protonation and other reactions in the emission
zone. Similarly, the use of 18O enriched water could possible
provide further insights, although at some expense!

Other beam
systems have been investigated in the past with the
aim of enhancing protonated organic molecule ion yields. Massive clusters
of glycerol were successful in desorbing and detecting large peptides,
much larger than can be detected in routine SIMS today;33 however, the development did not take off possibly
because of the technical difficulties of handling the glycerol beam.
Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) uses a spray of charged
droplets to desorb and ionize under atmospheric conditions.34 Proton exchange reactions are important in this
process, but yields relative to SIMS are difficult to determine. Giant
water cluster beams generated by electrospray methods35,36 have been successful in generating SIMS type spectra and would be
expected to deliver similar benefits to the cluster beam discussed
here. As we have argued, the authors suggest that the mechanism of
ion formation involves proton transfer that is greatly enhanced in
the impact region. There are challenges in handling this beam, and
it has been difficult to determine the degree of signal enhancement
relative to other ion beams from the data reported.

What do
the results reported here allow us to anticipate with future
developments of water cluster beams? We are looking for ion yields
that enable useful analysis of multiple compounds within a submicrometer
pixel area. The present studies have been exploratory to assess how
far it is worth pursuing the objective of a workable routine water
cluster beam. Table 1 shows that useful enhancements
have been made such that, if SIMS instrumentation capable of accumulating
the whole yield from a pixel is used, the water beam would provide
∼10 molecules per pixel. On the basis of comparisons between
10 and 20 keV Ar1000 data we have obtained in this laboratory,
we would expect at least a factor of 5 increase if the water beam
energy is increased to 20 keV. We would hope to obtain another factor
of 10× improvement by increasing the cluster size to 10 000.
This would provide a very useful benefit for analysis by taking whole
pixel yields into the 100s of ions, but only future experiments will
prove this. Similarly, we would hope that these enhanced conditions
would enable the matrix effect benefits to be increased too.
