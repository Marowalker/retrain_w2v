MRX34,
a microRNA (miRNA)-based therapy for cancer, has recently
entered clinical trials as the first clinical candidate in its class.
It is a liposomal nanoparticle loaded with a synthetic mimic of the
tumor suppressor miRNA miR-34a as the active pharmaceutical ingredient.
To understand the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug and to rationalize
an optimal dosing regimen in the clinic, a method is needed to quantitatively
detect the miRNA mimic. Here, we report the development and qualification
of a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR) assay in support of pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic assessments
in the nonhuman primate. Detection and quantification were performed
on total ribonucleic acid (RNA) isolated from whole blood. The qualified
range of the standard curve spans 6 orders of magnitude from 2.5 ×
10–7 to 2.5 × 10–1 ng per
reverse transcription (RT) reaction, corresponding to an estimated
blood concentration from 6.2 × 10–5 to 6.2
× 101 ng/mL. Our results demonstrate that endogenous
as well as the exogenous miR-34a can be accurately and precisely quantified.
The assay was used to establish the pharmacokinetic profile of MRX34,
showing a favorable residence time and exposure of the miRNA mimic
in whole blood from nonhuman primates.

==== Body
The use of synthetic microRNA
(miRNA) mimics is a new paradigm to treat cancer. These mimics replace
the function of natural tumor suppressor miRNAs that are frequently
lost or expressed at reduced levels in tumor tissues.1,2 miR-34a is the first in its class and has recently entered clinical
testing.3 The therapeutic formulation,
MRX34, is a liposomal nanoparticle (SMARTICLES) with a diameter of
approximately 120 nm.4 Its cargo, miR-Rx34,
is a doublestranded oligonucleotide as the active pharmaceutical ingredient
(API), whereby the active strand is identical to human miR-34a. In
preclinical animal models, systemic administration of MRX34 inhibited
the growth of primary tumors, blocked metastasis, and extended survival.5

To characterize the pharmacokinetic properties
of MRX34, a bioanalytical
method is required to accurately measure drug concentrations. Several
methods have been developed to detect short oligonucleotides such
as siRNAs, miRNAs, and locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense oligonucleotides.
These include hybridization assays,6 liquid
chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS),7 primer extension quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (PCR),8 and various methods based
on quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR).9−11 Several of these methods have been used during the preclinical development
of oligotherapeutics; however, an application for miRNA mimics that
is suitable for use in an IND program remains absent. Since the active
strand of our API is indistinguishable from the endogenous molecule,
we sought to employ a method that is (i) sufficiently sensitive to
detect miR-34a present at these low, endogenous levels and (ii) has
a large dynamic range to accurately quantify the exogenous miR-34a
mimic. The quantification of both miR-34a species is necessary to
characterize the pharmacokinetic behavior of miR-Rx34.

Here,
we describe the qualification of an RNA isolation procedure
and a miR-34a-specific stem-loop qRT-PCR assay that was expected to
meet the sensitivity and limits of quantitation necessary to support
a development program.12 Experimental conditions
of the qRT-PCR method were altered to improve the slope and to reduce
the noise of the assay. The method involved isolation of total RNA
from nonhuman primate blood followed by TaqMan probe-based qRT-PCR
detection. Our data show that the RNA isolation method provides consistent
recovery of high-quality RNA and can be used to extract miR-Rx34 from
fresh blood lysates and lysates stored for up to 45 days at −20
°C. The qRT-PCR method was assessed for the following parameters:
range of response, lower and upper limits of quantitation, precision,
accuracy, and specificity. The qualified range of the miR-34a qRT-PCR
assay spans 6 orders of magnitude, ranging from 2.5 × 10–7 to 2.5 × 10–1 ng per RT reaction,
which corresponds to an estimated blood concentration from 6.2 ×
10–5 to 6.2 × 101 ng/mL. The lower
limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was approximately 2 orders of magnitude
below the average levels of endogenous miR-34a. Samples containing
miR-34a concentrations above the upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ)
are diluted accordingly to bring concentrations into the qualified
range of the assay. Thus, the assay was deemed suitable for the quantification
of endogenous and exogenous miR-34a. The assay provided good specificity
with a 0% false-positive rate across the qualified range of the standard
curve and above the LLOQ. The method was used to determine the pharmacokinetic
profile of MRX34 in nonhuman primates after a single intravenous injection
of MRX34 at a dose level of 1 mg/kg.

Materials and Methods
Materials
and Reagents
MRX34 is a doublestranded 23-mer
mimic of miR-34a (miR-Rx34; MW = 14833.95) encapsulated in a liposomal
nanoparticle with an average diameter of 120 nm. The liposome comprises
the four lipids POPC, DOPE, CHEMS, and MOCHOL. miR-Rx34 was manufactured
by Girindus (Hannover, Germany), and the final MRX34 formulation was
prepared by Polymun Scientific (Vienna, Austria) as a 1 mg/mL stock
solution in 5% sucrose buffer. Synthetic mimics of miR-34c (miR-Rx34c,
MW = 14213) were purchased from Lifetech (Grand Island, NY). Naked
miR-Rx34 and miR-Rx34c were used as reference standards and prepared
in sterile, nuclease-free water containing 5 ng/μL yeast tRNA
(Ambion, Austin, TX).

Equipment
Total RNA yield was determined
by absorbance
measurement (A260) on the Nanodrop ND-1000 UV spectrometer (Thermo
Scientific, Wilmington, DE). All blood samples produced RNA concentrations
above the lower detection limit of 2 ng/μL of the NanoDrop instrument.
RNA integrity was determined by the Agilent Bioanalyzer utilizing
RNA 6000 chips (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). All PCR runs were performed
using the ABI 7900HT SDS (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and
RT reactions were performed using the GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied
Biosystems). Capillary gel electrophoresis was done using the Bioanalyzer
2100 instrument (Agilent).

Blood Samples
Whole blood samples
from nonhuman primates
were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, Preclinical Services
(Reno, NV). Blood samples were pooled and divided into 400 μL
aliquots to determine qualification specifications of the RNA isolation
procedure. For the determination of endogenous miR-34a levels, 175
μL of whole blood from six nonhuman primates were used. Each
animal was drawn twice to yield a total of 12 samples.

To establish
the pharmacokinetic profile of MRX34, one male and two female nonhuman
primates (Macaca fascicularis) was
administered MRX34 at a dose level of 1 mg/kg (N =
3/group) via a slow, intravenous bolus injection. Blood samples were
taken prior to dosing (predose) and at intervals after dosing as follows:
1, 7.5, 15, 45, 90, 180, 360, 720, and 1440 min postdose. Samples
were immediately transferred into an equal volume of RNA isolation
buffer and stored frozen at −20 °C until further analysis.

RNA Isolation Procedure
Total RNA from whole blood
was isolated using the mirVANA PARIS RNA isolation kit (Ambion) following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 400 μL of blood
lysate (200 μL whole blood + 200 μL RNA isolation buffer)
was combined with an equal volume of acid–phenol, vortexed,
and centrifuged at 13200g for 15 min. One half of
the aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube and vortexed with
1.25 × volume of 100% ethanol. Then, samples were applied to
glass fiber filter columns and centrifuged for 30 s followed by application
of washing buffers provided by the kit and according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. A volume of 50 μL of heated (95 °C), nuclease-free
water was used to elute the RNA from the column.

miR-34a qRT-PCR
Assay
For the detection and quantification
of miRNA by qRT-PCR, we developed a novel protocol that uses commercially
available reagents. In order to fall within the dynamic range of the
standard curve, whole blood total RNA eluent was diluted 1:10–1:100000
for spike-in isolation recovery studies. The diluted RNA, RT primer
and water was heat-denatured at 90 °C for 1 min and then cooled
to 4 °C. After this initial heat-denaturing step, the remaining
RT reagents were added and the RNA was converted to cDNA using MMLV-RT
(Invitrogen) under the following conditions: 4 °C for 15 min,
16 °C for 30 min, 42 °C for 30 min, and 85 °C for 5
min. TaqMan microRNA assays were used for expression analysis of hsa-miR-34a
and hsa-miR-24 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Following cDNA
synthesis, qPCR was performed on 2 μL of cDNA on the ABI Prism
7900HT SDS (Applied Biosystems) using Platinum Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen)
under the following cycling conditions: 95 °C for 1 min (initial
denature) and then 50 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C
for 30 s. Additions to the manufacturers’ reagents include
DMSO (final concentration of 6%) and tetramethylammoniumchloride (TMAC;
final concentration of 50 mM in both RT and PCR) to improve the slope,
linearity, and sensitivity of the assay.

Data and Statistical Analysis
All calculations [averages,
standard deviations, slopes, coefficients of determination, copy numbers,
and % coefficient of variations (CVs)] were calculated using Microsoft
Excel (Redmond, WA). Geometric means were generated to analyze cycle
threshold (Ct) values; averages were generated to analyze copy numbers
and mass values. Raw PCR data (Ct values) were transformed into miR-34a
copy numbers per RT reaction by SDS (Applied Biosystems) through extrapolation
to the miR-Rx34 standard curve (copies/ng). Copy numbers per milliliters
blood (copies/mL) were calculated according to eq 1 in which Vblood is the volume
of the blood sample used in the RNA isolation, IF is the RNA isolation
factor (typically 2) that accounts for the carry-over of only half
of the aqueous phase during the phenol extraction step, VRNA is the volume of the RNA eluate, DF is the dilution
factor that accounts for diluting the eluted RNA before use in RT,
and VRT is the volume of the diluted RNA
eluate used in RT. 1  

Mass of miR-Rx34 per mL blood (ng/mL)
was calculated by multiplying the calculated number of copies per
milliliters blood with the mass of one miR-Rx34 molecule (2.46323525
× 10–11 ng). Standard curve data and data produced
with QC and test samples were also presented as the corresponding
concentrations in whole blood (ng/mL). These calculations assumed
that RNA from blood is extracted in 50 μL of sterile, nuclease-free
water (see RNA isolation method).

Qualification End Points
for the RNA Isolation Procedure
To determine interexperimental
variability, two sets of three blood
samples (process samples, P) were isolated by one operator on two
separate days, such that samples P1–P3 were isolated on one
day, and samples P4–P6 were isolated on another day. In addition,
six test samples (T1–T6) were isolated to verify results obtained
from process samples. Average yields were determined from replicate
samples performed on each isolation day. RNA quality and integrity
were determined by capillary gel electrophoresis using the Agilent
Bioanalyzer and RNA 6000 chips (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). An RNA
Integrity Number (RIN) was determined for each sample and can range
between 1 and 10, whereby a value of 10 represents RNA with the least
amount of degradation. RIN values of high quality RNA typically ranges
between 7 and 10 (Agilent). The cutoff for normal blood samples was
a RIN of 7 or higher. Cutoff values were not applied to samples containing
exogenous miR-Rx34 because we expect an increase of the small RNA
fraction in these samples that could erroneously impact and lower
the RIN value. RNA recovery was determined using a set of blood samples
spiked with a known amount of test article (MRX34) in a serial dilution
(spike-in samples). The recovery rates of a highly abundant miRNA
(exogenous miR-Rx34) and a miRNA present at much lower levels (endogenous
house-keeping miRNA, miR-24) were determined by qRT-PCR. RNA stability
of the blood lysates frozen at −20 °C was determined using
a set of blood samples spiked with MRX34 and stored at −20
°C for up to 45 days (stability samples). This time frame was
deemed sufficient for the analysis of samples from good laboratory
practices (GLP) toxicity studies. Stability was determined by measuring
miR-Rx34 levels by qRT-PCR.

Qualification End Points for the miR-34a
qRT-PCR Assay
Acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy
were based on inherent
variations in the qRT-PCR method and were set at 50% deviation from
nominal with ≤50% CV. This variance is due to an inherent error
during the RT-PCR amplification that traditionally yields raw Ct values
with a standard deviation of up to approximately 0.5 Ct13 and can translate into an approximate 1.5-fold
error in concentrations. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of
the assay was defined as the lowest reference standard that (i) is
at least 5 times the response of a no-template control (NTC, blank
response) and (ii) yields a value with a precision of ≤50%
CV and an accuracy of ±50%. The upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ)
was defined as the highest reference standard that yields a value
with a precision of ≤50% CV and an accuracy of ±50%. Because
the background noise of the no-template control is not constant and
can vary between experiments, additional PCR-specific detection and
quantification limits were calculated for each qRT-PCR run and each
standard curve following a recommendation described in an ICH guideline.14 The PCR-specific lower limit of detection, referred
to as LLODP, was defined as the highest Ct value that can
be confidently distinguished from the background Ct value generated
by the no-template-control (NTC). The LLODP was calculated
as follows: LLODP = CtNTC – Δ1
in which Δ1 = (3.3 x σ)/–S, σ
is the standard deviation of the NTC replicates, and S is the slope of the standard curve. The PCR-specific LLOQ, referred
to as LLOQP, was defined as the highest Ct value for which
quantitation can be confidently distinguished from the background
Ct value generated by a no-template-control. The LLOQP was
determined as follows: LLOQP = CtNTC –
Δ2 in which Δ2 = (10 x σ)/–S, σ is the standard deviation of the NTC replicates, and S is the slope of the standard curve. Specificity was defined
as the % probability (= % false positive rate) of the miR-34a qRT-PCR
assay to erroneously amplify other oligonucleotides, such as its closest
natural homologue, the hsa-miR-34c mimic. This probability was reported
as a percentage of the nominal miR-34c input.

MRX34 Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Estimation of the pharmacokinetic
parameters was done using Phoenix WinNonlin software (Pharsight, Sunnyvale,
CA). A noncompartmental model was used to fit the miR-Rx34 whole blood
concentration (group mean) versus time data. The calculated parameters
included half-life, area-under-the-curve, clearance, and volume of
distribution. The elimination half-life, t1/2, was calculated from the slope of the regression line that best
fit the terminal portion of the log–linear concentration versus
time curve (λz). The area under the concentration versus time
curve (AUC) was calculated using the trapezoidal rule and extrapolated
to infinity. Total body clearance (CL), and volume of distribution
(Vd) were estimated using standard noncompartmental
methods.

Results
Qualification of the RNA
Isolation Procedure
The preparation
of total RNA followed a protocol that uses guanidine thiocyanate to
denature proteins, as well as an acid–phenol extraction and
a glass-fiber filtration step to rid the RNA from DNA and lipophilic
molecules. During the phenol extraction, we proceeded with merely
half of the aqueous phase to minimize contaminant and phenol carry-over,
to preserve the quality of the RNA and to ensure optimal buffer conditions
for subsequent PCR analyses. Thus, we anticipated consistent recovery
of RNA across multiple samples that contained the same starting material.

As shown in Table S-1 of the Supporting Information, 1 mL from a pooled source of nonhuman primate whole blood yielded
an average RNA concentration of 13069 ng/mL with a % CV of 16.6. All
RNA samples were of high quality, as analyzed by capillary gel electrophoresis
that produced RIN numbers between 8.9 and 9.4 for all samples.

To further investigate how much miRNA could be recovered in a background
of total RNA from whole blood, the levels of two miRNAs were evaluated:
(i) a highly abundant miRNA, miR-Rx34 (the active pharmaceutical ingredient
in MRX34), at concentrations used in toxicology studies and (ii) miR-24,
a house-keeping miRNA present at much lower levels.15 The recovery of miR-Rx34 was determined across a range
of blood samples spiked with MRX34 to yield a final miR-Rx34 input
of 100, 10, 1, 0.1, and 0.01 μg per sample (SP, spike-in samples).
miR-Rx34 levels were determined by qRT-PCR, and the miR-Rx34 data
were reported as mass (nanograms) and % recovery. The average percent
recovery of miR-Rx34 was 33.8 with a % CV of 9.3 (Table S-2 of the Supporting Information). A comparison of experimentally
recovered miR-Rx34 and starting materials shows tight correlation
across the five 10-fold dilutions (Figure S-1A of the Supporting Information, R2 = 0.9995). These results indicate that the recovery of the
therapeutic miRNA, miR-Rx34 formulated as MRX34, is consistent between
replicate isolations and independent of MRX34 blood concentrations.
To determine the recovery of a house-keeping miRNA, miR-24-specific
qRT-PCR was performed using the same RNA samples and the data were
reported as raw Ct values. Given consistent RNA recovery, the house-keeping
miRNA was expected to be present at similar levels in all RNA samples
such that raw Ct values would not differ by greater than 2× the
standard deviation of the mean. As shown in Figure S-1B of the Supporting Information, all miR-24 data were
between 18.17 and 19.20 Ct and were within the acceptable range. Thus,
the data suggest that the RNA isolation method provides consistent
recovery of miRNA, whether it is present at exogenous (miR-Rx34),
high, low, or endogenous (miR-24) levels. The data also show that
the addition of exogenous miRNA at high concentrations does not interfere
with the recovery of a lowly expressed miRNA.

Qualification of the miR-34a
qRT-PCR Assay
Standard Curves, Range, And Limits of Detection
Standard
curves were generated using the reference standard (miR-Rx34, MW =
14833.95) in a 10-fold, serial dilution to yield from 2.46 ×
10–7 to 2.46 × 10–1 ng miR-Rx34
per qRT-PCR reaction. This equals from 104 to 1010 miR-Rx34 copies and an estimated blood concentration from 6.16 ×
10–5 to 6.16 × 101 ng/mL. This range
is expected to be sufficient for the quantification of endogenous
and exogenous miR-34a. Standard curves 1–3 and 4–6 were
performed on two separate days. All standard curves were derived from
triplicate data points, and each qRT-PCR run included a set of 12
no-template controls (qRT-PCR reactions without template RNA input,
NTC) to determine the noise of the assay. Raw PCR data (Ct, cycle
threshold), expressed in log2, were converted into mass miR-Rx34 (nanograms)
and estimated blood concentrations (nanograms/milliliters). Because
some of the analysis required the use of raw data, assay performance
criteria are presented for Ct values (log2 space) and data converted
to nanograms (linear space).

In a first step, raw Ct data were
used to generate trendlines and to calculate slopes, R2 values, and PCR-specific limits of detection and quantitation,
LLODP and LLOQP. The highest reference standard
(2.46 × 10–1 ng, 1 × 1010 miR-Rx34
copies) typically produced Ct values between 11 and 12 (Table 1). The lowest standard (2.46 × 10–7 ng, 100 miR-Rx34 copies) produced an average Ct value of ∼30
and was well-removed from the NTC that yielded a Ct value between
32 and 34. This NTC value was a reproducible result due to detectable
fluorescence at an earlier cycle and is in contrast to other miRNA
qRT-PCR assays for which NTCs are usually 35 or greater (unpublished
data). We speculate that primers used to amplify the miR-34a sequence
are more likely to self-anneal, which can result in primer amplification
and increased background noise.12 Thus,
the average LLODP and LLOQP was 33.12 and 31.25
Ct, respectively. All six standard curves exhibited a slope between
−3.0549 and −3.1369; the average slope was −3.1226
(Figure S-2 of the Supporting Information). Since the reference standards were prepared in a 10-fold dilution
series and Ct values are expressed in log2 space, a theoretical standard
curve has a slope of −3.3219. Typically, miRNA standard curves
determined experimentally have a slope of −3.0 (±0.5).
Thus, standard curves generated here produced curves with an acceptable
slope. The coefficients of determination (R2) values ranged between 0.9970 and 0.9984 for all six standard curves.
The data were generated with a final concentration of 6% DMSO and
50 mM TMAC in both the RT and PCR steps of the miR-34a assay. A comparison
with a traditional assay absent these reagents shows that the major
improvements relate to slope and reduced background in NTC samples
(Figure S-3 of the Supporting Information).

1–3 and
4–6 were generated on two separate days. Data are presented
as raw Ct values. The qRT-PCR specific LLOD and LLOQ values, LLODP and LLOQP, were calculated as described in Materials and Methods.

To determine the intraexperimental error of the miR-34a
assay,
triplicate qRT-PCR runs per reference standard concentration were
analyzed. Because both raw values (log2 space) and data converted
into the linear space are frequently used to evaluate the performance
of qRT-PCR assays, results from standard curve 1 expressed as Ct or
mass miR-Rx34 (ng) are shown (Table 2). Traditionally,
qRT-PCR assays yield Ct values with standard deviations of up to ±0.5
Ct due to an inherent error during the RT step and amplification of
the PCR template.16 When expressed in the
linear space, however, this error can translate into an approximate
50% variation. Therefore, an acceptable CV for the miR-34 assay is
one that is equal or below 50%, and an acceptable range for accuracy
is ±50%. As shown in Table 2, SD values
derived from Ct data were well below 0.5 with SD values of 0.1–0.4
Ct over the input range evaluated. After conversion into mass miR-Rx34,
the same data produced CV values of 5.3%–25.4%. The mean SD
value from any reference point in any of the six standard curves was
0.15 Ct, corresponding to a mean CV value of 13.4% as a measure of
the intraexperimental error (Table S-3 of the Supporting Information). The interexperimental error across
all six standard curves was below 15.72% CV with a mean of 10.5% CV
(Table S-3 of the Supporting Information).

a Data from standard curve 1 are
presented as raw Ct values and nanogram miR-Rx34.

In a second step, we converted raw
PCR data into mass of miR-Rx34
and estimated blood concentrations (Table 3). Back-calculated concentrations were within 60–144% of nominal
input concentrations with % CV of 15.7 or less. The average LLODP value was 4.3 × 10–8 ng miR-Rx34 per
RT reaction which equals an estimated blood concentration of 1.1 ×
10–5 ng/mL. The average PCR-specific LLOQP value was below the lowest reference standard (1.6 × 10–7 ng per RT reaction, 4.1 × 10–5 ng/mL). Thus, the LLOQ of the miR-34a assay proved to be the lowest
standard (2.5 × 10–7 ng per RT reaction which
equals an estimated blood concentration of 6.2 × 10–5 ng/mL). The LLOQ was 9.1× the response of the no-template control,
exhibited ≤20% variation, and an average intraexperimental
error of 12.6% CV. On the basis of these data, we hypothesize that
we can detect as little as 1747 miR-34a copies per RT reaction and
accurately quantify as little as 6657 copies per RT reaction. The
average level of endogenous miR-34a measured in most tissues ranges
around 50000 copies/ng RNA.6 This is equivalent
to approximately 750 copies/cell, given an overall RNA content of
15 pg/cell. On the basis of this calculation, we would need RNA from
∼3 and ∼9 cells per RT reaction to detect and to quantify
endogenous miR-34a, respectively. The ULOQ was the highest standard
that produced ≤40% variance and an average intraexperimental
error of 9.3% CV. Thus, the qualified range of the miR-34a assay spanned
6 orders of magnitude, ranging from 2.5 × 10–7 to 2.5 × 10–1 ng miR-Rx34, which equals an
estimated blood concentration of 6.2 × 10–5–6.2 × 101 ng/mL. Blood concentrations used
in toxicology studies may be much higher and, therefore, will need
to be diluted accordingly to bring the sample signal into the quantifiable
range of the assay.

Precision and Accuracy
To determine precision and accuracy
of the miR-34a assay, a set of four different concentrations of the
reference standard (miR-Rx34) in sterile, nuclease-free water containing
5 ng/μL yeast tRNA (quality control samples, QC) were used in
conjunction with each standard curve. These QC samples covered the
high (1 sample), mid (1 sample), and low end (2 samples) of the standard
curves such that the input was 1.23 × 10–1 ng
(high), 1.23 × 10–3 ng (mid), 1.23 × 10–5 ng (low), and 1.23 × 10–6 ng
(low) miR-Rx34 per RT reaction, respectively. This equaled an estimated
blood concentration of 3.08 × 101, 3.08 × 10–1, 3.08 × 10–3, and 3.08 ×
10–4 ng/mL, respectively. As shown in Table 4, the mean intraexperimental precision was 16.2%
CV, and the mean interexperimental precision was 15.1% CV in agreement
with the variation observed for those of reference standard concentrations.
The average calculated concentrations of QC samples were within 60.1–92.7%
of nominal input concentrations with % CV of 18.9 or less, indicating
consistent recovery of miR-Rx34 at these concentrations. Thus, precision
and accuracy of the miR-34a assay was within the acceptable range.

Specificity
The therapeutic miR-34a
mimic spans a length
of 23 nucleotides and differs by 6 nucleotides from its closest natural
homologue, miR-34c. To determine the false-positive rate of the miR-34a
assay, two dilution series from 2.36 × 10–7 to 2.36 × 10–1 ng mass input per qRT-PCR
reaction using either the miR-34a (miR-Rx34) or the miR-34c (miR-Rx34c)
reference standards were prepared. Both reference standards were used
as templates in the miR-34a qRT-PCR assay. A set of NTC samples was
included to calculate LLOQP. As shown in Table S-4 of the Supporting Information, false-positive miR-34a
reported by the miR-34a assay using miR-34c as the template ranged
between 9.81 × 10–9 and 1.15 × 10–8 ng across all data points of the miR-34c standard
curve. These values are similar to those generated with the NTC samples
(4.42 × 10–9 ng) and below the LLOQ of the
miR-34a assay (2.46 × 10–7 ng). Therefore,
the miR-34a assay is specific for the quantification of miR-34a within
the qualified range.

Frozen Storage and Stability of miR-Rx34
in Whole Blood Sample
Lysates
To test whether the recovery of miR-Rx34 is affected
during frozen storage, aliquots of blood lysates spiked with known
amounts of MRX34 were stored at −20 °C for up to 45 days
(stability samples, ST1–12). miRNA levels were determined by
the miR-34a qRT-PCR assay and reported as mass and % recovery. If
storage affected the integrity of the active pharmaceutical ingredient,
we expected lower miR-Rx34 recovery for samples stored longer (i.e.,
day 45) versus those processed immediately (day 0). As shown in Table
S-5 of the Supporting Information, the
average recovery of miR-Rx34 ranged between 47.0% and 51.9% for nonhuman
primate blood lysates stored up to 45 days at −20 °C.
This is consistent with the recovery shown earlier and did not change
over the 45 day sampling period. The data suggest that miR-Rx34 in
nonhuman primate blood lysates is stable for at least 45 days when
stored at −20 °C.

Endogenous miR-34a Levels
in Whole Blood from Nonhuman Primate
Since the active strand
of the therapeutic miRNA mimic, miR-Rx34,
is identical to the mature, endogenous miR-34a, the qRT-PCR assay
is unable to distinguish between the synthetic and the natural version
of miR-34a. Although the exogenous miRNA is expected to be in excess
relative to the endogenous during early time points of toxicology
studies, it is prudent to know how much the endogenous miRNA contributes
to the total amount of miR-34a present in the blood and when exogenous
levels decline to baseline levels. To determine endogenous miR-34a
concentrations, we tested 12 naïve blood samples derived
from a total of 6 nonhuman primates. Total RNA from each sample was
diluted 1:10 in nuclease-free water containing 5 ng/μL yeast
tRNA before being used in qRT-PCR. As shown in Table 6 of the Supporting Information, the average blood concentration
of endogenous miR-34a was 0.046 ng/mL and was approximately 750-fold
above the LLOQ of the assay (6.2 × 10–5 ng/mL).
This result demonstrates that the miR-34a assay is sufficiently sensitive
to detect endogenous miR-34a in nonhuman primate blood. The CV value
was 89.8%, suggesting significant variation between miR-34a levels
in these samples. To determine the source of this variation, we compared
miR-34a concentrations with levels of the house-keeping miRNA, miR-24
(Figure S-4 of the Supporting Information). Interestingly, samples drawn from the same animal produced very
similar data, suggesting that the main source of this variation is
biological variability (see also precision of the miR-34a qRT-PCR
of standard 2.46 × 10–05: CV = 10.3%, Table 3). However, the miR-24 levels across different animals
were not constant, and therefore, inconsistencies in RNA isolation
could add to this variation.

Blood Pharmacokinetics
of MRX34 in Nonhuman Primates
The pharmacokinetic parameters
of MRX34 were determined in a group
of three Cynomolgous monkeys. The drug was given as a slow, intravenous
bolus at 1.0 mg/kg at a dose level that was considered pharmacologically
relevant. At intervals after dosing and at termination, whole blood
samples were taken for the quantification of miR-Rx34. In addition,
predose samples were taken to determine the expression levels of endogenous
miR-34a. Total RNA was diluted appropriately to ensure that raw data
fall within the qualified range of the standard curve (Table S-7 of
the Supporting Information). The average
endogenous level was 0.042 ng/mL in agreement with our data generated
during the qualification of the assay (Figure 1). In contrast, blood concentrations of miR-Rx34 were ∼6807
ng/mL at the earliest sampling time point (1 min) and decreased to
∼313 ng/mL within 24 h. These concentrations are ∼160000×
and 7500× greater than endogenous levels, respectively. Approximately
95.4% of the starting material was eliminated from the blood during
this time frame. A noncompartmental fit of the blood concentration-versus-time
curve produced an estimated half-life of miR-Rx34 of 7.7 h, an AUC
value of 16968 h ng/mL, a volume of distribution value of 650 mL/kg,
and a clearance rate of 60 mL/h/kg. The data suggest that liposome-encapsulated
miR-Rx34 has a favorable residence time in blood with concentrations
that are well above baseline levels 24 h post-treatment.

Figure 1 Pharmacokinetics
of liposome-encapsulated miR-Rx34 in nonhuman
primates. MRX34 was administered as a slow, intravenous bolus into
a group of three nonhuman primates at a dose level of 1 mg/kg. Whole
blood was collected at time points as indicated in the graph. Total
RNA were isolated from 175 μL of whole blood per sample and
eluted in 50 μL sterile, nuclease-free water. To ensure that
miR-Rx34 concentrations are within the qualified range of the assay,
RNA samples collected 1 min through 360 min post injection were diluted
1:10000. RNA samples collected 720 and 1440 min after administration
of MRX34 were diluted 1:1000. RNA samples from untreated animals were
diluted 1:10 to measure concentrations of endogenous miR-34a. For
each qRT-PCR run, 2 μL of diluted RNA were used. Data are expressed
as nanograms per milliter of blood.

Discussion
There are many analytical
methods to detect nucleic acids, and
several of these have been used to measure concentrations of therapeutic
oligonucleotides. Mimics of endogenous miRNAs represent a new class
of therapeutic oligonucleotides for which an optimal analytical platform
in support of an IND submission has not yet been reported. Typically,
performance in the context of the specific analyte under investigation
determines the assay of choice, owing to the fact that each assay
has its own advantages and limitations.9 For the quantification of the miR-34a mimic, we chose quantitative
PCR because it has an exceptional dynamic range and is the most sensitive
method. It enables the quantification of the therapeutic mimic as
well as the endogenous miR-34a that is expressed at low levels and
is indistinguishable from the active strand of our API. The measurement
of both miR-34a species is necessary to fully understand drug behavior.
The qRT-PCR method described here is based on stem-loop RT and Taqman
qPCR.12 Experimental conditions specific
to the performance of the miR-34a assay have been altered to improve
linearity and sensitivity. For instance, the addition of DMSO and
TMAC were critical in generating standard curves with a slope close
to −3.3219 and reducing the noise of the NTC. In addition,
our assay enables the detection of a double-stranded miRNA mimic by
including a heat-denaturing step prior to RT-PCR to facilitate optimal
conditions for annealing the unique RT primer to the miRNA template.
This is not a typical step in other commercially available RT-PCR
kits. Without the initial heat denature step, the reverse transcription
reaction efficiency is greatly compromised and, as a result, the miRNA
mimic is poorly quantified in qRT-PCR.

A disadvantage commonly
attributed to qRT-PCR is reduced precision
and accuracy in comparison to other analytical methods. Depending
on the gene and matrix, the SD values between technical RT and qPCR
replicates can be as high as 0.9 Ct.12,17 Traditionally,
we observe SD values that range between 0.1 and 0.3 Ct, and we accept
SD values below 0.5 Ct. This variance can translate into a ∼50%
error and is applied to precision and accuracy. Despite these relaxed
acceptance criteria, however, the mean SD value from replicate qRT-PCR
reactions was 0.15 Ct and, thus, was far below 0.5 Ct. Similarly,
the mean intraexperimental precision was 16.2% CV and well below the
50% mark. Accuracy was approximately 60–93% of the nominal
input across the qualified range of the standard curve. Although we
did not investigate the source of variation during our qRT-PCR, we
speculate that the reasons for variation are the same as those identified
for mRNA qRT-PCR. Studies evaluating the variation of RT and qPCR
using RNA from various specimens, including blood samples, showed
that the RT step is the major contributor to noise and that assay
efficiencies depend on priming strategies, the gene of interest, and
total RNA concentrations.

The utility of the miR-34a assay was
demonstrated in the determination
of the pharmacokinetic properties of MRX34 in the nonhuman primate.
On the basis of efficacy studies in mouse models of hepatocellular
carcinoma and scaling dose levels from mouse to nonhuman primate by
body surface area or body weight, administering a 1 mg/kg injection
was considered a therapeutically active dose. The Cmax of liposome-encapsulated miR-Rx34 in whole blood peaked
at the earliest time point after dosing (1 min post dosing) and was
approximately 5 orders of magnitude above endogenous miR-34a levels.
Within the first 6 h, blood concentrations declined by ∼10-fold
and stayed well above baseline levels during the remainder of the
sampling period. In summary, the data suggest a favorable residence
time of encapsulated miR-Rx34 and provided the basis for the design
of toxicokinetic studies in nonhuman primates and the calculation
of the first dose in man in the MRX34 phase I clinical trial.
