Bioorthogonal
strategies are continuing to pave the way for new analytical tools
in biology. Although a significant amount of progress has been made
in developing covalent reaction based bioorthogonal strategies, balanced
reactivity, and stability are often difficult to achieve from these
systems. Alternatively, despite being kinetically beneficial, the
development of noncovalent approaches that utilize fully synthetic
and stable components remains challenging due to the lack of selectivity
in conventional noncovalent interactions in the living cellular environment.
Herein, we introduce a bioorthogonal assembly strategy based on a
synthetic host–guest system featuring Cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7])
and adamantylamine (ADA). We demonstrate that highly selective and
ultrastable host–guest interaction between CB[7] and ADA provides
a noncovalent mechanism for assembling labeling agents, such as fluorophores
and DNA, in cells and tissues for bioorthogonal imaging of molecular
targets. Additionally, by combining with covalent reaction, we show
that this CB[7]–ADA based noncovalent interaction enables simultaneous
bioorthogonal labeling and multiplexed imaging in cells as well as
tissue sections. Finally, we show that interaction between CB[7] and
ADA fulfills the demands of specificity and stability that is required
for assembling molecules in the complexities of a living cell. We
demonstrate this by sensitive detection of metastatic cancer-associated
cell surface protein marker as well as by showing the distribution
and dynamics of F-actin in living cells.

==== Body
Developing
strategies to selectively assemble bioorthogonal molecular components
within the complexities of cells and tissues is of great interest
in biology.1,2 It continues to drive advancements in various
domains of fundamental and medical research, including protein modification,3−5 sensitive assay development,6 therapeutic
targeting,7 and cell surface engineering.8 Additionally, such bioorthogonal strategies have
become the key components in applications that require molecular tagging
or labeling, such as imaging.9−14 To date, a variety of covalent approaches were developed for this
purpose. Notable examples include the Staudinger ligation reaction,15 Cu(I) catalyzed or strain promoted azide–alkyne
cycloaddition reaction (“click” chemistry),16,17 and inverse electron demand 1,2,4,5-tetrazine (Tz) ligation.18−20

Noncovalent interactions offer an alternative approach for
bioorthogonal assembly with kinetic benefit. The association between
noncovalent affinity pairs is typically diffusion controlled and proceeds
at a significantly higher rate (kon ∼
109–1010 M–1 s–1) as compared to their covalent counterparts (kon ∼ 1–104 M–1 s–1).21 Such fast kinetics
offers important advantage to achieve efficient labeling when using
low nanomolar (nM) concentration of a small and rapidly clearing probe,
which is often the case in vivo. While kinetically
beneficial, the use of noncovalent recognition motifs in biological
labeling and imaging experiments is majorly restricted to naturally
occurring biotin–streptavidin system.22 Biotin–streptavidin based systems suffer from few intrinsic
drawbacks, including immunogenicity, background, and specificity issues
from the endogenous presence of biotin. Additionally, large molecular
weight of streptavidin (∼66 kDa) limits the potential application
of this system in studies that require rapid diffusion (e.g., pretargeted
nuclear imaging and therapy) or intracellular labeling in live cells.
On the other hand, the use of synthetic recognition motifs, while
a promising avenue, poses major challenges due to the chemical complexities
of the living system and lack of selectivity in conventional noncovalent
interactions. Recently, we reported a nanoparticle labeling approach
for cancer cell detection via utilization of a β-cyclodextrin
(β-CD) based synthetic binding pair.23 Although this method provided increased sensitivity in magnetic
resonance-based detection, the method is restricted to multivalent
nanoparticle based probes due to low affinity (Kd ∼ 10–4 M) and selectivity issues
with β-CD based binding pairs.

In recent years, Cucurbit[n]uril
(CB[n]), a family of synthetic macrocyclic hosts,
has gained considerable attention due to their attractive molecular
recognition property.24−32 It has led to the development of new studies in materials fabrication,33−39 bio-sensing,40−42 protein immobilization and separation,43−52 and drug delivery.53−60 Of this CB[n] family, the heptameric member CB[7]
is specifically interesting because of their well-defined structure,
superior water solubility, and biocompatibility, coupled with their
ability to form highly selective and ultrastable host–guest
inclusion complexes in aqueous medium.24,25,28 These remarkable attributes have motivated us to
investigate whether CB[7] based synthetic host–guest platform
could be used for fast and efficient noncovalent labeling of cells
and tissue samples. Importantly, we envisioned that the high affinity
and selectivity of the CB[7] host–guest system would be well
suited for targeting molecules inside living cells. While this manuscript
was under review, Kimoon Kim, Kyeng Min Park, and co-workers reported
an elegant example of CB[7] based system for bioimaging application.61

Herein, we report a CB[7] based noncovalent
tag for bioorthogonal labeling of cells and tissue samples. By attaching
CB[7] with primary targeting agents (e.g., antibodies) and employing
ADA conjugated fluorophore, we show that host–guest interactions
between CB[7] and ADA provides an in situ noncovalent
coupling mechanism for bioorthogonal imaging in cells. The CB[7]–ADA
system displays exceptional serum stability and maintains high coupling
efficiency even after incubation of the components at 37 °C for
16 h. We demonstrate the versatility of this labeling platform by
employing the CB[7]–ADA interaction to achieve high-density
DNA labeling for PAINT (points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale
topography) based super-resolution imaging. Importantly, we show that
high density labeling via CB[7]–ADA interaction helps to improve
imaging resolution for visualizing structures that were impossible
to resolve using biotin–streptavidin based labeling platform.
We establish the translation of this noncovalent labeling platform
to image target molecules in the complexities of tissue samples by
using the Drosophila melanogaster model system. Additionally,
we show that the CB[7]–ADA based noncovalent system provides
a completely orthogonal labeling platform against the existing covalent
system (e.g., Tz ligation) and thus their combination could be used
for simultaneous labeling of multiple biomolecules within a single
biological system. Finally, we establish the utility of CB[7]–ADA
system to enable specific labeling of molecules in a live cell environment
by imaging metastatic cancer-associated cell surface protein marker
and showing distribution and dynamics of small molecule targeted F-actin
in living cell.

Experimental Section
Antibody Modification with
CB[7]
Secondary antibodies were purchased from commercial
sources and passed through a Zeba spin column (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
pre-equilibrated with PBS (pH 7.4) containing 10% 1 M NaHCO3. Antibodies were then incubated with tetrazine-NHS (Tz-NHS) at room
temperature (RT) for 2 h. The conjugated product was purified using
Zeba spin column pre-equilibrated with PBS (pH 7.4). CB[7]–PEG-TCO
was synthesized by following the protocol mentioned in the Supporting Information. Afterward strain promoted
cycloaddition reaction between antibody-Tz and CB[7]–PEG-TCO
in PBS (pH 7.4) resulted in the formation of CB[7] conjugated antibodies.
The conjugated product was characterized by matrix-assisted laser
desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry.

Phalloidin
Conjugation with CB[7]
Phalloidin amine was purchased from
commercial source and dissolved in dry dimethylformamide (DMF). Then
it was reacted with Tz-NHS in the presence of triethyl amine at RT
for 3 h for formation of Tz conjugated phalloidin. Conjugated product
was purified by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) using water/acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid
(TFA) as eluent. The tetrazine-conjugated phalloidin was characterized
by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). The purified product
was reacted with CB[7]–PEG-TCO at room temperature in water
for 12 h to obtain CB[7] conjugated phalloidin.

ADA Conjugation
with Fluorophores (ADA Imager)
Commercially available NHS
ester derivatives of fluorophores (Cy5 and Rhodamine) were conjugated
with maleimide via amine-NHS ester coupling. The conjugated product
was purified by reversed phase HPLC using water/acetonitrile containing
0.1% TFA as eluent. Maleimide conjugated fluorophores were characterized
by HRMS. ADA was modified to a thiol derivative on one end for coupling
with maleimide-modified fluorophores. A thiol-ene coupling reaction
has been carried out between thiol modified ADA and maleimide conjugated
fluorophores in PBS medium at RT for 12 h. Then ADA imagers were purified
by HPLC using water/acetonitrile containing 0.1% TFA as eluent and
characterized by HRMS. The imagers were dissolved in PBS and used
in host–guest based imaging.

ADA Conjugation with DNA
ADA was conjugated with DNA through thiol–maleimide coupling
conjugation reactions. At first, amine modified DNA was conjugated
with NHS ester of maleimide to synthesize maleimide conjugated DNA.
Conjugated product was purified using 0.1 M TEAA buffer (pH 7.4) as
eluent and characterized by MALDI-MS. After that, DNA–maleimide
was reacted with thiol modified ADA to get ADA conjugated DNA. We
purified the conjugated product by using reversed phase HPLC and employing
0.1 M TEAA buffer (pH 7.4) as eluent. The conjugated product was characterized
using MALDI-MS.

Optical Setup for Host–Guest Based
Imaging in Structured Illumination Method
The fluorescence
images were acquired using an inverted Zeiss ELYRA PS1 microscope
in structured illumination mode. Two lasers (561 nm (200 mW) and 642
nm (150 mW)) have been used for respective excitation of fluorophores.
10% Laser power from the objective top was used for structured illumination
imaging. Imaging was performed using a Zeiss oil-immersion objective
(alpha Plan-apochromat DIC 63×/1.40 Oil DIC M27, numerical aperture
(NA) 1.40 oil). Fluorescence light was spectrally filtered with emission
filters (MBS-561+EF BP 570–650/LP 750 for laser line 561 and
MBS-642+EF LP 655 for laser line 642) and imaged using a PCO edge
sCMOS camera (quantum yield >70%). Structured illumination 2D and
3D images were processed using structured illumination analysis package
for Zen software (Zeiss). Additional softwares have been used for
color adjustment (ImageJ) and data analysis (Origin 9.0).

Immunostaining
Protocol for CB[7]–ADA Interaction Based Imaging
Approximately
25 000 cells/well were plated in 8-well chamber slides and
allowed to grow up to 60% confluence. Culture media was removed and
cells were washed using PBS (pH 7.4). The cells were immediately fixed
using suitable fixation methods (4% PFA for 15 min or chilled methanol
for 7 min at −20 °C or 0.1% glutaraldehyde and 3% PFA
for 10 min at RT). Afterward, cells were permeabilized using 0.25%
triton X-100 for 10 min (this step is skipped for methanol fixation)
and blocked using 3% BSA and 0.1% triton X-100 in PBS for 2 h at RT.
Cells were then stained with 10 μg mL–1 primary
antibody for 24 h at 4 °C. After removing excess primary antibody
by washing with PBS, the cells were stained with 10 μg mL–1 CB[7] conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h at
RT. Excess secondary antibodies were removed by washing with PBS and
ADA conjugated fluorophores were incubated for 30 min. Cells were
subsequently used for host–guest based imaging after removing
excess unbound fluorophores by washing with PBS.

DNA–PAINT
Imaging Using Host–Guest Interaction Based Labeling
HeLa cells were used for the DNA–PAINT imaging. Methanol fixed
cells were treated with primary and CB[7] conjugated secondary antibodies.
Subsequently, ADA conjugated DNA docking strand was incubated with
CB[7] tagged cells for 30 min. Gold nanoparticle (drift marker) was
deposited on the imaging well by centrifuging the nanoparticle solution
at 450 rcf for 3 min. Atto 655 conjugated DNA (1 nM) in PBS containing
500 mM NaCl was incubated with the cells for DNA–PAINT imaging.
Single molecule blinking was recorded using a 642 nm excitation laser
line. 50% Laser power has been used for image acquisition using a
Zeiss oil-immersion TIRF objective (alpha Plan-apochromat DIC 100×/1.46
Oil DIC M27, NA 1.46). Fluorescence light was spectrally filtered
with emission filter (MBS-642+EF LP 655 for laser line 642) and imaged
on an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) camera (Andor
iXon DU897, quantum yield >90%, 512 × 512 pixels). EMCCD camera
gain was kept at 50 during image acquisition. Exposure time of 100
ms was used for image acquisition. A total 10 000 frames were
reconstructed to a super resolution image using Zen software package
(ZEN 2.0).

Small Molecule Based Labeling of F-Actin
For labeling F-actin, fixed (4% PFA) and permeabilized cells were
incubated with 2 μM solution of CB[7] conjugated phalloidin
for 12 h at 4 °C. Excess phalloidin was removed and host–guest
based imaging was performed after addition of ADA conjugated fluorophores
and subsequent washing with PBS.

Multiplexed Imaging Protocol
in Cells and Tissues
Cells or thoracic muscle tissues from
adult flies were treated with primary antibodies against microtubule
(or mitochondria). Then CB[7] conjugated secondary antibody (or CB[7]
conjugated phalloidin) were treated for labeling of CB[7] in cells.
The orthogonal pair, TCO conjugated secondary antibody was also added
together with CB[7] secondary antibody. After removal of excess antibodies,
ADA–fluorophores and Tz–fluorophores were added to the
cells (or tissues). Structured illumination images were recorded after
removal of excess unbound fluorophores.

Phalloidin Delivery and
Host–Guest Based Live-Cell Microscopy
HeLa cells were
used for the live-cell microscopy experiment. Approximately 25 000
cells/well were plated in 8-well chamber slides and allowed to grow
up to 60% confluence over 18 h. Cell culture media was then removed
and the cells were washed using DPBS (pH 7.4). Two μM concentration
of phalloidin-CB[7] conjugate was assembled with HMD conjugated AuNP
at a concentration ratio of 10:1. The assembly was subsequently added
to the cells. Cells were then maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere for 3 h. After 3 h incubation,
cells were washed twice with DPBS. The cells were immediately incubated
with 100 nM solution of Rhodamine conjugated ADA imager and kept inside
the microscope at 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere for
host–guest interaction-based imaging. Structured illumination
images were recorded for hours with every 1 min interval.

Results
and Discussion
Host–Guest Interaction Mediated Bioorthogonal
Labeling in Fixed Cell
To probe the feasibility of the CB[7]
based host–guest interaction as a tool for bioorthogonal labeling,
we first used an antibody based targeting platform and fluorophore
as an imaging agent. We selected ADA as the guest component for this
study and harnessed its ability to form highly selective and ultrastable
monovalent host–guest inclusion complex with CB[7] with a Kd of ∼10–13 M (Figure 1A).24 The microtubule structures in fixed mouse embryonic fibroblast
(MEF) cells were targeted using CB[7] conjugated antibodies (CB[7]–Ab)
and subsequently host–guest interactions between CB[7] and
ADA were used as the in situ coupling mechanism between fluorophores
and antibodies (Figure 1B). Antibodies were covalently conjugated with CB[7] through utilization
of photochemically functionalized CB[7] (Scheme S1). Successful antibody conjugation was verified by MALDI-MS
analysis (Figure S5). To evaluate the effectiveness
of the labeling, Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) images were
acquired after coupling CB[7] labeled microtubules with ADA conjugated
Cy5 dye (ADA–Cy5) through CB[7]–ADA host–guest
interaction. Figure 1C shows SIM image from MEF cells that was acquired with a 642 nm
excitation laser. Notably, the CB[7]–ADA interaction based
labeling was highly selective to the microtubule structure with minimal
nonspecific binding. In addition, the labeling was stable, as multiple
washing cycles did not result in loss of signal intensity (Figure S26). Overall, these results demonstrate
that highly selective and ultrastable host–guest interactions
between CB[7] and ADA offers a novel noncovalent coupling platform
for bioorthogonal labeling of target molecules in cellular complexities.

In Situ Labeling Kinetics and Stability of Host–Guest
Bioorthogonal Platform
We characterized in situ binding kinetics of CB[7]–ADA based labeling via time–lapse
fluorescence imaging. After targeting microtubules with CB[7]–Ab,
cells were incubated with ADA–Cy5 for different time duration. Figure 2A–G shows
time–lapse fluorescence images that confirms fast CB[7]–ADA
mediated fluorophore binding with fluorescence signal reaching saturation
in less than 15 min. Notably, it is clearly evident from Figure 2A that incubation
for only 60 s with 250 nM ADA–Cy5 was sufficient to clearly
visualize microtubule structure, indicating fast and efficient target
labeling with ADA–Cy5. We also observed that increasing imager
concentration to 1 μM resulted in efficient labeling even with
5 s of incubation time (Figure S27). Next,
we tested whether exceptionally high association rate between CB[7]
and ADA would allow efficient labeling and no-wash imaging at low
nM imager concentration. Three targets, including microtubules, mitochondria,
and actin, were imaged using CB[7]–ADA mediated interaction.
We observed that the use of 5–10 nM ADA imager provides sufficient
probe accumulation at the target site, enabling high-contrast and
real-time imaging of target biomolecules without employing washing
step (Figures S28 and S29). Taken together,
these results shows that extremely fast, highly selective, and ultrastable
host–guest interactions between CB[7] and ADA offers a novel
noncovalent coupling platform for bioorthogonal labeling of target
molecules at low nanomolar probe concentration.

time duration. (H) Plot of fluorescence intensity vs time indicates
saturation of labeling arises within 15 min of incubation with ADA–Cy5
imager. Scale bar 2 μm (A–G).

Coupling platforms that provide high reactivity while maintaining
stability are the most ideally suited for biological studies.62 We subsequently conducted a physiologically
relevant stability experiment with CB[7]–ADA system and compared
it with a frequently used Tz based covalent system. Reactive reagents
were incubated in serum-supplemented culture media at 37 °C.
Microtubule labeling efficiency was evaluated after 16 h of incubation
via fluorescence imaging. Figures S30 and S31 show that CB[7]–ADA was able to maintain high-efficiency
labeling while Tz ligation-based reagents showed significant deterioration,
clearly indicating the higher stability of the synthetic host–guest
system under biological conditions.

pH is an important consideration
in labeling experiment as it varies between different intracellular
organelles. For example, pH of lysosome is ∼4.5 whereas pH
of mitochondria is ∼8. To understand the effect of pH, we performed
CB[7]–ADA host–guest interaction based labeling experiment
under various pH conditions ranging from 4.5 to 9.2. Fluorescence
microscopy images clearly showed the specific and efficient labeling
of microtubules under all different pH conditions (Figure S32). Besides pH, high labeling efficiency was observed
when CB[7]–ADA interaction mediated coupling was performed
in various cell culture media (Figure S33). These results indicate the efficacy of CB[7]–ADA interaction
under stringent labeling conditions.

CB[7]-ADA Based DNA Labeling
and Super-Resolution DNA–PAINT Imaging
In recent years,
labeling biomolecules with DNA has gained considerable interest due
to its utility in various emerging technologies, including immuno-PCR
and super-resolution imaging.63 To demonstrate
the versatility of the CB[7]–ADA based labeling platform, we
choose DNA as a second labeling agent. A 11 NT DNA sequence was selected
for this labeling study with a goal to perform DNA-PAINT based super-resolution
imaging of biomolecules. To label biomolecules with DNA via CB[7]–ADA
based interaction, we synthesized ADA functionalized DNA strand (ADA–DNA)
via thiol–maleimide coupling (Scheme S8). Similar to the case of fluorophore, we targeted microtubule using
CB[7]–Ab and subsequently incubated the cells with ADA–DNA
for specific DNA immobilization on microtubule via CB[7]–ADA
interactions (Figure 3A). To test super-resolution imaging capability, we carried out single-molecule
imaging using complementary ATTO655-conjugated DNA strand. Figure 3A shows the super-resolved
image that was reconstructed from DNA–PAINT imaging. A significant
increase in resolution as compared to the diffraction-limited image
could be easily observed by visualizing a dense microtubule region
(Figure 3B). To highlight
the labeling quality, we measured the cross-sectional profile of localization
of a single microtubule filament. Importantly, as shown in the magnified
view (Figure S34), we were able to resolve
the hollow tubular structure of the filament having diameter of ∼42
nm, while previously demonstrated DNA–PAINT imaging using biotin–streptavidin
mediated DNA labeling was unable to resolve this hollow tubular structure.62 This underlines the importance of the high labeling
density and efficiency of CB[7]–ADA based coupling method,
as both of these parameters significantly contribute toward achieving
improved spatial resolution.

interaction. The installed DNA tag was used as docking sites for DNA–PAINT
based imaging. (B) Super-resolved image of microtubules using CB[7]–ADA

image of the boxed region clearly shows the distribution of closely
spaced microtubules. (C) Diffraction limited image of the same magnified
region shows indistinguishable microtubules. Scale bar: 1 μm
(B) and 500 nm (magnified view and part C).

Host–Guest Labeling in Tissue
After successful demonstration
of the CB[7]–ADA based noncovalent labeling in cells, we progressed
to study the utility of this labeling method in tissue samples. The
vast diversity and complexity existing within tissue specimens presents
a significant challenge for noncovalent labeling tools to operate
with high selectivity. For evaluating the CB[7]–ADA based labeling
method, we have chosen ovary tissues of Drosophila melanogaster model and specifically labeled the actin cytoskeleton. Phalloidin,
a bicyclic heptapeptide, was used as a highly specific small molecule
binder for F-actin. Approximately 30 μm thick ovary tissue sections
were dissected, fixed and stained with CB[7] conjugated phalloidin
derivative by overnight incubation. Excess CB[7]–phalloidin
was removed by washing and ADA–Cy5 imager was added before
mounting on microscopic slide. SIM image (Figure 4) clearly shows the fluorescently labeled
actin network in the complex ovary tissue, which is wrapped around
by a layer of surrounding muscle tissue. Importantly, a negligible
amount of nonspecifically bound probes were observed from the SIM
image. The specificity in actin staining demonstrates the ability
of ADA imager to selectively find its CB[7] binding partner even in
the complexities of tissues. Additionally, primary target labeling
using phalloidin probe establishes the small molecule imaging potential
of CB[7]–ADA based labeling platform.

mediated labeling and imaging of actin filaments in the ovary tissue
and the muscle sheath enveloping the egg chamber of Drosophila model system. Actin filaments were targeted using CB[7] conjugated
phalloidin derivative. Scale bar: 10 μm (xy) and 17.3 μm (z depth).

Multiplexed Bioorthogonal Labeling in Cells and Tissue
Modern
biochemical studies often require simultaneous tracking of multiple
biomolecules within a single system. These studies demand applications
of two bioorthogonal pairs that are mutually orthogonal. Although
a variety of covalent bioorthogonal reaction exists, often time cross-reactivity
between several bioorthogonal covalent reagents limits their potential
application in multiplexed experiments.17 The CB[7]–ADA based labeling method presents a new opportunity
for multiplexed labeling as this noncovalent interaction based bioorthogonal
labeling approach is orthogonal to the existing covalent approaches.
To demonstrate proof-of-principle validation, we used Tz–TCO
ligation as a covalent component along with CB[7]–ADA based
noncovalent interaction for simultaneous labeling and imaging of multiple
target molecules in cells and tissue sections (Figure 5A). In cells, microtubules were stained using
CB[7] conjugated antibodies and mitochondria were stained using TCO
conjugated antibodies. The corresponding imager strands, selected
for dual-color imaging, are ADA conjugated Rhodamine and Tz conjugated
Cy5. We acquired dual-color SIM images after incubating the cells
with dye modified binding partners for 15 min. Figure 5B shows that microtubule network has strong
fluorescence signal from Rhodamine, whereas mitochondrial compartment
has strong signal from Cy5. This suggests that ADA–Rhodamine
and Tz–Cy5 are able to assemble selectively with CB[7] and
TCO, respectively. Similar experiments performed in Drosophila muscle
tissue with CB[7]–ADA targeting actin and Tz–TCO targeting
microtubule also showed specific dual color labeling (Figure 5C). Additionally, we show that
integrating more number of orthogonal labeling pairs can effectively
increase the multiplexing power. To demonstrate this, we performed
three color multiplexed imaging using one noncovalent (CB[7]–ADA)
and two covalent pairs (Tz–TCO and azide–dibenzocyclooctyne
(DBCO)). We targeted three intracellular proteins by these three orthogonal
pairs: CB[7]–antibody to microtubule, TCO–antibody to
mitochondria, and DBCO–phalloidin to actin filaments. ADA–rhodamine,
Tetrazine–Cy5, and azide–bodipy were used as the recognition
pairs for target visualization. As shown in Figure S35, multicolour imaging performed via SIM indicated specific
labeling of all three targeted intracellular proteins with negligible
cross reactivity. These experiments demonstrate that CB[7]–ADA
based noncovalent interaction along with covalent bioorthogonal reaction
provide excellent mutual orthogonality to enable simultaneous labeling
and multiplexed imaging in biological complexities.

Microtubules and mitochondria were labeled using CB[7] and TCO conjugated
antibodies, respectively. Multiplexed images were captured after addition
of ADA–Rhodamine and Tz–Cy5. (C) Multiplexed imaging
of actin and microtubule in thoracic muscle tissue of Drosophila using orthogonal labeling pairs. Actin was targeted using phalloidin–CB[7]
and microtubule was targeted using antibody–TCO conjugate.
Scale bars: 5 μm (parts B and C).

To achieve multiplexed imaging by only applying CB[7]–ADA
based interaction, we devised a sequential multiplexing approach.
In this case targets were sequentially labeled (via CB[7]–ADA
interaction), imaged, and bleached to finally achieve a multiplexed
readout. For this purpose, initially we targeted mitochondria using
CB[7] conjugated antibody and imaged using ADA–Cy5 fluorophore.
Then the mitochondria labeled fluorophores were photobleached by illuminating
high intensity laser for 30 s. Next, microtubules were labeled and
imaged using antibody–CB[7] followed by ADA–Cy5 incubation.
Finally, actin was labeled by using phalloidin–CB[7] and ADA–Cy5
after photobleaching of microtubule labeled fluorophores (Figure S36). This sequential labeling approach
by using only a single dye demonstrate the effectiveness of CB[7]–ADA
based labeling approach for higher order multiplexed imaging.

Live Cell
Bioorthogonal Imaging via Host–Guest Mediated Interaction
We next investigated the compatibility of CB[7]–ADA interaction
for labeling in live cell environment by imaging a vascular adhesion
protein (VCAM) that localizes on the cell membrane. VCAM was selected
as our potential target given its clinical importance as an important
marker for determining ovarian cancer metastasis and its therapeutic
response. Bioorthogonal noncovalent labeling of VCAM expressing SVEC
(Saphenous Vein Endothelial Cell) cell was carried out by using CB[7]–Ab
followed by incubation with ADA–Cy5 imager. The SIM image that
was captured from live cells showed fluorescence from cell membrane,
indicating specific staining of VCAM via CB[7]–ADA mediated
interaction (Figure 6A,B). To support the specificity in the labeling process, two control
experiments were performed, where we first omitted the primary antibody
from the labeling scheme and second cells were treated with ADA–Cy5
alone. Both of these control experiments resulted in the loss of fluorescence
from cell membrane as observed via fluorescence microscopy (Figures S37 and S38). We further used Fluorescence
Activated Cell Shorting (FACS) to quantitatively analyze the live
cell labeling data (Figure S39). Strong
fluorescence response in the presence of CB[7] targeting conjugate
and ADA imager agent as compared to the controls clearly demonstrate
the specificity of the ADA imaging agent for CB[7]-modified antibody
in the presence of live cells and serum environment.

Imaging was carried out after incubation with ADA–Cy5 imager.
(C) Intracellular labeling of actin filaments in live HeLa cells using
phalloidin–CB[7] and ADA–Rhodamine imager. (D) Actin
dynamics were indicated in the arrowed region from the boxed region
in part C. Scale bars: 5 μm (A–C) and 2 μm (D).

The demand for precise control
over selectivity is amplified when it is necessary to perform coupling
experiment in highly complex chemical environments, such as those
found in intracellular environment of a living cell. To evaluate the
potential of CB[7]–ADA based bioorthogonal chemistry for live
intracellular labeling, we imaged F-actin using phalloidin–CB[7]
derivative in live HeLa cells. The labeling of F-actin in live cell
was carried out by gold nanoparticle assisted delivery of phalloidin–CB[7]
conjugates inside live cell (Figure S40). While previous studies indicated the cell permeable nature of
CB[7],41,42,60,63−65 nanoparticle assistance was necessary
for this study presumably due to cell impermeable nature of phalloidin
or the larger size of the resultant phalloidin–CB[7] complex.
Gold nanoparticle surface was functionalized with hexamethylene diamine
(HMD) ligand through a biocompatible tetraethylene glycol linker.
Noncovalent interaction between HMD and CB[7] drives phalloidin–CB[7]
to enter intracellular environment and interact with F-actin. Two
μM phalloidin–CB[7] labeled the actin fibers sufficiently
with the aid of 200 nM gold nanoparticles. 100 nM ADA–Rhodamine
was used to acquire SIM images of F-actin in living cells. It should
be noted that HMD guest binds with CB[7] with an affinity of ∼10–7 M (Kd) whereas ADA possess
an affinity of ∼10–13 M (Kd) toward CB[7]. Therefore, the initial complex between
HMD–CB[7] will be disassembled by presentation of the orthogonal
guest molecule ADA, which has relatively high affinity for CB[7].
This guest exchange process leads to the formation of more stable
CB[7]–ADA complex, leading to efficient target labeling. SIM
image, shown in Figure 6C, clearly visualizes the high-density actin networks, reflecting
the ability of ADA to specifically find its binding partner in a living
intracellular environment. To study the dynamic nature of actin, time-lapse
SIM images were recorded over 36 min with 1-min interval (Figure 6D and Supporting Movie 1). 0, 4, 8, and 16 min time
point images show distribution of actin filaments over the cell, whereas
the arrowed region in each frame shows the dynamic nature of actin
filaments (Figure 6D). This study illustrates that the interaction between CB[7] and
ADA satisfies the demands of specificity and stability that is required
for assembling molecules in the complexities of a living cell and
serum environment.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
introduced a fully synthetic and noncovalent CB[7] based tag for fast
and efficient bioorthogonal assembly in cells and tissues. Benefiting
from the extremely high association rate via noncovalent interactions,
the CB[7] tag allows efficient labeling at low nM probe concentration
and enables microscopic investigation without excess probe washing.
The CB[7] tag is highly stable in biological media under physiologically
relevant temperature. It is capable of maintaining strong selectivity
and affinity toward ADA even in the complexities of a living intracellular
environment, and this feature can be used to perform live-cell imaging.
CB[7]–ADA based labeling not only works well in biological
systems but also works well with existing covalent bioorthogonal chemistries.
This mutual orthogonality provides ability to perform multiplexed
labeling. CB[7] tag provides a synthetic alternative to the biotin–streptavidin
system with features that are often more appropriate for biological
studies, such as pretargeted in vivo imaging, where efficient labeling
is desirable using small and rapidly clearing probe. We expect that
this versatile noncovalent platform will find application in various
studies, including cell surface engineering, nanoparticle targeting,
and creating macroscale cellular assembly.
