Using
label-free ToF-SIMS imaging mass spectrometry, we generated
a map of small molecules differentially expressed in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc. The distributions of these moieties were in
line with gene expression patterns observed during wing imaginal disc
development. Combining ToF-SIMS imaging and coherent anti-Stokes Raman
spectroscopy (CARS) microspectroscopy allowed us to locally identify
acylglycerols as the main constituents of the pattern differentiating
the future body wall tissue from the wing blade tissue. The findings
presented herein clearly demonstrate that lipid localization patterns
are strongly correlated with a developmental gene expression. From
this correlation, we hypothesize that lipids play a so far unrecognized
role in organ development.

==== Body
Tissue and
organ development
is governed by a multitude of signaling processes, patterning, and
growth events. Model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster are often used to study these developmental events and gain fundamental
insight of organ development. The majority of pathways governing the
development of Drosophila are evolutionarily conserved.1 Therefore, knowledge gained by studying this
model organism’s development can be transferred to other species
such as humans.

The appendages of the adult fly such as wings,
legs, or antenna
develop from organ primordia called imaginal discs.2,3 The
discs are subdivided into different compartments (e.g., dorsal, ventral,
anterior, posterior compartments). The compartments are made of cells
with distinct identities that do not mix.4−6 Compartmentalization
is established in the early embryo, when the major body axes are determined.
The compartment boundaries act as organizing centers that govern growth,
patterning, and development of these discs. The boundaries define
the expression of so-called morphogens, proteins which either act
locally or diffuse over short and/or long ranges to pattern the growing
organ.7−11 The identification of the molecules (classically proteins and RNAs)
is often assigned to defined developmental processes due to their
expression patterns or localizations to specific areas of the developing
tissue. Genes with similar restricted expression patterns are thought
to play related roles. In contrast to the wealth of knowledge that
has been obtained about the spatiotemporal restriction of gene expression,
as well as that of the corresponding RNAs and proteoforms, the organization
and distribution of other molecules, such as carbohydrates and lipids,
is not well understood. This lack of knowledge can be traced back
to the challenges associated with studying the localization of small
molecules, e.g., lipids, with high spatial resolution. Recent work
in the model system Drosophila melanogaster has described
and quantified lipids over the course of its life cycle.12,13 These studies demonstrated that different tissues exhibit distinct
phospholipid compositions but did not report the intraorgan distribution
of these small molecules. Such spatial information is crucial to relating
specific molecular moieties to specific biological processes in genetic,
disease, or developmental models. In order to identify novel small
molecules, such as lipids and carbohydrates, that are crucial for
a developmental process, we need to look for distribution patterns
that resembled those of already known components.

In this work,
we determined the distribution of small molecules
in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, using a combination
of imaging time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS)
and coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS). These two complementary,
label-free techniques make use of two inherent properties of small
molecules, their mass and vibrational properties. We demonstrate that
small molecules show well-defined distributions within this tissue.
Strikingly, these distributions mimic genetically established patterns
known to be essential for wing development and growth.

Materials and
Methods
Sample Preparation
Drosophila melanogaster were grown under standard growth conditions at 22 °C. Adult
flies were transferred to new food every 2 days. Wing imaginal discs
were manually dissected from wild-type yellow white (yw) third instar
larvae (day 6 after egg laying) for CARS and ToF-SIMS analyses unless
stated otherwise. For ToF-SIMS analysis (results shown in Figures 1A and 2A,B,C), genetically modified Drosophila lines
with the genotype yw,hsp-flp; UAS-mCD8::GFP/CyO; hh-Gal4/TM6b were used.500 The mCD8::GFP is a fusion protein between mouse lymphocyte marker CD8 and the
green fluorescence protein, which is expressed under hh control in this study. The hh-Gal4 is an enhancer trap line inserted
into the hh locus. The enhancer trap carries a Gal4 gene and Gal4 expression is now influenced by the hh regulatory elements. Wing imaginal discs were manually
dissected in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and dehydrated
in a 10× PBS solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, NL) for 30
min. For CARS, the discs were then mounted on conventional microscopy
cover slides, washed with MS-grade water (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht,
NL) three times to remove additional salts, and then analyzed.

Figure 1 Small molecule
distributions revealed by ToF-SIMS on the wing imaginal
disc of Drosophila melanogaster (top) and corresponding
developmental patterns (bottom, refs (22, 23)). PCA of ToF-SIMS PCA data (top row) revealed patterns reminiscent
of developmental patterns (bottom row). The patterns anterior/posterior
(A/P; A), dorsal/ventral (D/V; B), pouch/nonpouch (N/NP; C), and body
wall/wing blade (B/W; D) were detected. The A/P, D/V, and P/NP compartments
were only observed in negative ion mode. The B/W subdivision was observed
in both negative and positive ion modes (E). A = anterior, P = posterior,
D = dorsal, V = ventral, B = body wall, W = wing blade. Wing imaginal
discs dimensions indicated.

Figure 2 Small molecule patterns identified by ToF-SIMS mimic known developmental
patterns. Upper panel: Imaginal disc microscopy images of GFP-labeled hedgehog expression patterns that occur exclusively in the
posterior compartment (A) and ToF-SIMS PCA showing the anterior compartment
(green) and posterior compartment (purple; B) of the same imaginal
disc were superimposed (C). Lower panel: The fold appearing in late
third instar (D, E, F, red arrows) was used as a landmark for the
nonclassical body wall/wing blade (B/W) pattern. In the high vacuum
of the instrument, this fold expands to a crack (E, red arrows). The
expression of small molecules, determined by ToF-SIMS PCA, changes
exactly at this crack boundary (F, red arrows). Thus, both boundaries
revealed by PCA coincide with established compartment boundaries in Drosophila development. The scale bar in E indicates 150
μm.

For ToF-SIMS, discs were transferred
to conductive ITO slides with
4–8 ′Ω resistance, Delta Technologies, Stillwater,
MN). The discs were washed with MS grade water (Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht,
NL) three times to remove additional salts and then air-dried. The
discs were then covered with a 2 nm gold layer using a sputter coater
(Quorums Technologies SC7640, Newhaven, UK) equipped with a FT7607
quartz crystal microbalance stage and a FT7690 film thickness monitor.
For LCMS/MS analysis, a Bligh and Dyer extract was prepared from the
wing discs prior to analysis.14

Microscopy
Discs were imaged with a Leica DMRX (Leica,
Wetzlar, Germany) microscope equipped with an OSRAM HBO 50W/L2 short
arc mercury lamp (Osram AG, München, Germany) at 10× magnification.

Data Acquisition
ToF-SIMS
Secondary ion mass spectrometry
was performed
using a Physical Electronics (PHI) TRIple focusing ToF ion (TRIFT-II)
instrument equipped with a gold liquid metal ion gun (Physical Electronics,
Chanhassan, MN, USA). Then, 22 keV Au+ primary ions were
“micro” focused on the sample surface. The total primary
ion dose density amount was kept well below the static limit. Positive
or negative secondary ions were extracted to the mass analyzer with
a static voltage of ±3.5 kV and postaccelerated in front of the
ion detector (dual-stage microchannel plate) by an additional 10 kV.
The signal from ions in the m/z range
1–1500 m/z was recorded.
Full wing discs were imaged step-by-step in a mosaic formed by 8 ×
8 individual tiles between which the stage moved.15,16 Each tile of about 80–95 μm in width was probed by
the primary ion beam in a 256 × 256 pixel raster for a duration
of 30 s to ensure that the total ion dose was below the static limit
of SIMS. The size of each pixel was approximately 0.35 μm. The
resulting image was saved as a RAW file for further data processing.
The pulse width of the primary ion beam was 1 ns.

CARS Microspectroscopy
A dual-output laser source (Leukos-CARS,
Leukos, Limoges, France) provided the pump and Stokes beams to enable
CARS analysis. The laser source was a passively Q-switched 1064 nm
microchip laser, delivering <1 ns pulses at a 32 kHz repetition
rate and ∼300 mW average power. The laser beam was equally
divided into two separate beams with a 50/50 beam splitter. One beam
was sent through a bandpass filter (FL1064-10, Thorlabs, USA) and
used directly as the pump beam. The other beam was introduced into
a photonic crystal fiber that creates super continuum emission of
420–2400 nm at the fiber output, with >100 μW nm–1 spectral power density from 1.05 to 1.6 μm.
The supercontinuum was coupled out of the fiber with a reflective
collimator (RC04APC-P01, Thorlabs, USA) and passed through 700 nm
(FEL0700, Thorlabs, USA) and 830 nm (LP02-830RS-25, Semrock, USA)
long-pass filters. The Stokes and pump beams overlapped at a dichroic
mirror (LP02-1064RU-25, Semrock, USA) and were introduced into a modified
inverted microscope (Eclipse Ti–U, Nikon, Japan). The pump
and Stokes pulses were tightly focused onto the sample with a near
IR objective (PE IR Plan Apo 100×, NA 0.75, Seiwa, Japan). The
sample was mounted on nested stepper-motor-driven (Microstage, Mad
City Laboratories, USA) and piezo-driven stages (Nano-PDQ 375 HS,
Mad City Laboratories, USA) that together provide 25 mm travel range
with <1 nm resolution. The CARS signal generated by the sample
was collected in the forward direction by another objective (M-20X,
NA 0.4, Newport, USA) and sent through notch (NF03-532/1064 ×
10–25, Semrock, USA) and short-pass filters (FES1000,
Thorlabs, USA) to remove the pump and Stokes beams. The filtered CARS
beam was dispersed by a spectrometer (Shamrock 303i, 300 lines mm–1, 1000 nm blaze, Andor, UK) and detected on a deep-depletion
CCD (Newton DU920P-BR-DD, Andor, UK). The sample was raster-scanned
across the focal volume with steps of 1 μm in-plane and 2 μm
axially. Large three-dimensional images were reconstructed from adjacent
tiles with in-plane dimensions of 75 × 75 μm or 50 ×
50 μm and axial dimensions determined by the thickness of the
wing disc due to the large dimension of the wing disc. For each position
in the sample, a CARS spectrum in the range between −3400 and −600
cm–1 was acquired. CARS images were acquired with
pixel dwell times of 50 ms.

Lipid Analysis by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS
Third instar wing
imaginal discs were collected using the mass isolation approach developed
in-house as described in ref (16). Approximately, 1000 individual discs were used per replicate.
Lipids were extracted using a modified Bligh and Dyer method.14 The extracts were removed, dried in
vacuo, and reconstituted in isopropanol. HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analyses
were conducted on a Thermo Fisher Q Exactive mass spectrometer (San
Jose, CA) with online separation using a Thermo Fisher/Dionex RSLC
nano HPLC. HPLC conditions were as follows: Atlantis dC18, 3 μm,
300-μm × 150 mm column (Waters Corporation, Massachusetts);
mobile phase A, acetonitrile/water (40:60) containing 10 mM ammonium
acetate; mobile phase B, acetonitrile/isopropanol (10:90) containing
10 mM ammonium acetate; flow rate, 6 μL/min; gradient, 10% B
to 60% B over 5 min, 60% B to 99% B over 35 min and held at 99% B
for 10 min. Data-dependent MS/MS scans were performed using one full
MS scan [m/z 200–2000; 70 000
resolution (m/z 300)] followed by
fragmentation in the HCD collision cell of the six most abundant ions
in the precursor scan using a normalized collision energy of 35 arbitrary
units and mass analysis in the Orbitrap at 17 500 resolution.
Separate analyses were conducted using positive and negative ion detections.

Data analysis details for all experimental techniques have been
provided in the Supporting Information.

Results
Third instar wing imaginal discs were analyzed with
ToF-SIMS imaging
mass spectrometry in both negative and positive ion mode. Principal
component analysis (PCA) was used to unravel the complexity of the
ToF-SIMS data sets. Inspection of the principal components (PC) from
the negative ion mode measurements revealed four PCs reflecting molecular
distributions (Figure 1, top row), which colocalized with known genetically predicted tissue
subtypes such as anterior vs posterior compartmentalization (A/P; Figure 1A) and dorsal from
ventral tissue (D/V; Figure 1B). Additionally, patterns reminiscent of the pouch/nonpouch
(Figure 1C) and the
body wall/wing blade (B/W; Figure 1D) differentiation were observed. All these compartments
are known to play an important role in Drosophila melanogaster wing development and are associated with specific gene expression
patterns.6,9,17−21 Positive ion mode experiments repeatedly confirmed the B/W distribution,
and it was therefore chosen to follow up (Figure 1E and Figure S1).

Next, we determined whether two compartment boundaries (A/P
and
B/W) observed by ToF-SIMS matched with known developmental boundary
markers. For the A/P subdivision, we used the classical compartment
boundary established by differential expression of the morphogen hedgehog (hh), which is responsible for
the establishment and maintenance of the A/P compartment.24 Fluorescent images of third instar imaginal
discs expressing GFP under the control of hh-Gal4 were generated and coregistered with the ToF-SIMS PCA score images
obtained from the same imaginal discs (Figure 2A and B) (see Materials
and Methods). Clearly, the subdivisions identified by ToF-SIMS
were related to the compartmentalization established by the known
genetic circuits (Figure 2C).

The B/W compartment boundary (Figure 2D, arrows) is normally delineated by a tissue
fold appearing in the late third instar.20 Comparing the total ion image with the PCA image of the same imaginal
disc, the fold leading to a crack in the ToF SIMS instrument provides
a landmark to determine the expression pattern of small molecules
observed by ToF-SIMs in the PCA (Figure 2E and F).

The analytical limitation
of ToF-SIMS restricts the molecular identification
of the PC patterns to small molecules.25 We employed CARS to identify the main small molecule classes represented
in the ToF-SIMS PCA expression patterns. CARS has the chemical specificity
to allow the assignment of molecular classes. In that respect, the
CARS data allow us to determine the nature of the majority of peaks
and provide guidance in the selection of the patterns to investigate
further. CARS provides image contrast based on molecular vibrations
that are distinct for different molecules. Using CARS, we acquired
the vibrational signatures of the molecules (in the frequency range
corresponding to Raman shifts from −3200 cm–1 to −900 cm–1) from late third instar wing
imaginal discs. In the fingerprinting region (−1800 cm–1 to −900 cm–1), the chemical
moieties giving rise to specific peaks are largely known and can be
found in the literature.26 Multivariate
statistical analysis (PCA) was applied to screen for patterns in the
CARS data set, similar to that performed for the ToF-SIMS data sets.
A clear B/W pattern similar to the one found by ToF-SIMS (Figure 3A, B, and C) is observed.
No other CARS PCA pattern was observed that resembled any of the previously
described patterns. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) revealed
a positive correlation score between the CARS and ToF-SIMS data sets
for the B/W patterns (Figure 3C and Supporting Information Table 1). Next, we investigated the spectral region of the CARS measurement
from the correlating value 2 (CV2) to further identify the molecular
components of the B/W pattern. In the CARS spectra, the dispersive
C–H feature and the phenylalanine peak at −1000 cm–1 suggested a protein dominance for the body wall,
whereas the spectral composition indicated a dominance of lipids in
the wing blade section (Figure 3D). Therefore, we conclude that the components of the B/W
patterns observed in ToF-SIMS are lipids. From the ToF-SIMS spectra
of the wing blade section, we observed a highly reproducible pattern
of peaks. Based on previously assigned m/z values, 22 lipids were assigned to the classes of monoacyl-
(MAGs), diacyl- (DAGs), and triacylglycerols (TAGs; Figure 4) with DAG (34:2/375.3m/z)
being the most abundant peak in the positive part of the PC loadings
spectra. The principal component loading spectra show little correlation
between the mono- and diacylglycerols and the intact phospholipids.
This indicates that these peaks most likely do not originate from
SIMS induced lipid fragmentation. The correlation of the MAGs and
DAGs with the TAGs indicates that the acylglycerols in general play
an important role in maintaining cellular organization in the wing
discs. Supporting this identification is the observation of the corresponding
[M + NH4]+ DAG ions in the LC-MS/MS experiment
being an indication that at least part of the overserved ions are
endogenous. However, we cannot exclude that the MAG and DAG related
peaks in the SIMS experiments are fragments from TAGs present on the
cellular surface. The analysis conditions were optimized to minimize
the fragmentation of intact phospholipids and TAGs.

Figure 3 CARS-revealed lipid origin
for the B/W pattern. CARS was applied
to test if patterns observed by ToF-SIMS can be reproduced and to
gain further knowledge about the molecules involved. PCA of CARS data
demonstrated a similar B/W pattern (A) to that observed in ToF-SIMS
(B). CCA was applied to visualize the correlation of the observed
patterns from ToF-SIMS and CARS (C; quantification listed in Supporting Information Table 1). Investigation
of the normalized CARS spectra in arbitrary units (a.u.) revealed
a higher content of lipids in the wing blade region compared to the
body wall (D). The scale bar in A indicates 200 μm. The left
and right images in all panels A–D represent principal components
in the 3200–2700 cm–1 and the 1800–800
cm–1 wavenumber range, respectively.

Figure 4 Assignment of peaks from ToF-SIMS measurements. The images
show
the positive and negative part of the PC distinguishing the B/W compartments
(left top and middle panel) from the same imaginal disc as used in Figure 1. The loading spectrum on the right shows the positive
loadings corresponding to W with a yellow background and negative
loadings corresponding to B with a light blue background. The lower
left panel is a color-coded overlay (yellow = W, blue = B). To assign
the potential lipid species, we used a recently published m/z catalogue with assigned lipids.12 Loading spectra show that monoacyl- (MAG), diacyl-
(DAG), and triacylglycerols (TAG) are over-represented in the wing
blade section (yellow). The white scale bar in the top left image
indicates 150 μm.

To confirm this identification of the ToF-SIMS peaks, we
performed
orthogonal validation using high-performance liquid chromatography
and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS,
hereafter referred to as MS/MS for simplicity) of lipid extracts of
whole wing imaginal disc.27 This data set
was utilized as a high-mass-accuracy MS reference data set for tissue-specific
lipids. We identified 156 lipid species (for details, see Materials and Methods section) containing most of
the major lipid classes previously assigned.12,13 Of the 156 lipid species, five were MAGs, 22 DAGs, and 10 TAGs.
Seven species overlapped between the differential patterns observed
by ToF-SIMS and MS/MS methods (Table 1). Among these lipids was also the previously reported
DAG (34:2). Its identity in the ToF-SIMS data could further be confirmed
using the loadings spectra from the negative ion mode ToF-SIMS data
(Figure S2).

Table 1 Identified
MAGs, DAGs, and TAGs by

a The columns
show the lipid class,
mass value (m/z), species, as well as the monoisotopic
mass of each lipid identified in the six replicate ToF-SIMS measurements
(Figure S1). The lipids identified by both
ToF-SIMS and MS/MS are highlighted in yellow. The most abundant peak
of the ToF-SIMS loading spectra (m/z 573.3) also
identified by MS/MS is shown in blue text. n.d. indicates a non-detected
species in that measurement. The asterisk in the last column indicates
that the listed SIMS m/z values
could also be explained as the sodium adduct of an ion that contains
two carbon atoms and three double bonds less. For example, [M+H–H2O]DAG36:4 is nominally equivalent with [M+Na–H2O]DAG34:1.

Discussion
In this study, we applied ToF-SIMS to analyze the distribution
of small molecules in the wing imaginal disc of third instar Drosophila melanogaster larvae. We found that their distributions
separated into two PCs with distinct subdivisions (Figure 1). Intrigued by these ToF-SIMS
patterns, we compared them to known genetic expression patterns at
the same developmental time-point and found striking similarities.
These pattern similarities were in part confirmed by coregistration
of images of GFP fluorescence under hedgehog promotor
control, a classical marker of the A/P compartment boundary. Additionally,
the B/W pattern is defined and confirmed by a well-known visible margin
that correlates with the ToF-SIMS images (Figure 2). By investigating CARS PCA spectra (Figure 3) and tentative assignments
from ToF-SIMS peaks (Figure 4), using a previously published catalogue, we identified the
predominant small molecule species in the wing blade region of the
B/W pattern as lipids.

The possible role of these lipids in
pattern formation and maintenance
must be evaluated in light of their crucial metabolic and biochemical
properties. Recent lipidomic studies revealed that DAGs and TAGs levels
increase in the wing imaginal disc during larval development, reaching
a peak at late third instar.12,13 While TAGs are mainly
considered storage lipids from which energy can be gained via β-oxidation,28,29 they are not
used for energy production during pupation and metamorphosis.12 Whether TAGs assume a different function in
imaginal discs remains to be elucidated. In contrast to TAGs, DAGs
show different kinetics based on their fatty acid (FA) chain length.
Medium-FA-chain DAGs drastically decrease at the transition from third
larval instar to the pupa stage, whereas long-chain DAGs continue
to increase, which suggests that different DAGs assume distinct metabolic
functions during Drosophila development; these functions
also remain to be determined. We identified one DAG, termed DAG(34:2),
by both ToF-SIMS and MS/MS, and found intermediate chain C16:1 and
C18:1 as the two most abundant FAs in this DAG. This, and other intermediate-chain
DAGs, may be used as building blocks for the rapid synthesis of new
phospholipids.

Several roles of DAGs have been described. Some
DAGs serve as second
messengers in several receptor signal transductions via the hydrolysis of membrane lipids into DAGs and inositol-3,4,5-triphosphate
(IP3) by the enzyme phospholipase C. The generation of
IP3 leads to a release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic
reticulum. Ca2+ together with the DAG signaling pathway
governs processes like cell division and differentiation.30 Additionally, phospholipase D activity is known
to regulate cell growth and proliferation using Raf and mTOR as mediators.31 DAGs remodel the membrane in response to effector
signals, which might contribute to compartment boundary formation
and maintenance. In the immune system, for example, successful phagocytosis
requires actin remodeling by DAG generation.32 Other mechanisms leading to similar membrane remodeling and polarization
are reviewed in ref (33). It has been demonstrated elsewhere that DAGs in combination with
other membrane lipids in distinct proportions have an important function
in determining the structure and dynamics of biological membranes.34 For example, the membrane composition of a cell
is important for the curvature of the membrane itself on a single
cell level.35 Likewise, it can be presumed
that the membrane composition of a subtissue region, such as a compartment,
may influence the curvature of the tissue. Such a phenomenon might
be responsible for the generation of tissue folds, and our data seem
to be consistent with this notion (Figures 1 and 2). Alternatively,
an over-representation of DAGs in one cell population might increase
the cells’ affinity to each other and thereby contribute to
the segregation of cells of different populations. We hypothesize
that DAGs might also be differentially distributed in the two leaflets
of the lipid bilayer as a consequence of the increasing tension generated
during metamorphosis. As the organism undergoes tremendous change
during pupariation, it is likely that an enormous amount of membranes
must be generated in a very short time. The lipid patterns observed
from our studies offer important insights for the potential role(s)
of lipids during Drosophila wing development and
cellular organization.
