Performing
rheo-microMRI velocimetry at a high magnetic field with
strong pulsed field gradients has clear advantages in terms of (chemical)
sensitivity and resolution in velocities, time, and space. To benefit
from these advantages, some artifacts need to be minimized. Significant
sources of such artifacts are chemical shift dispersion due to the
high magnetic field, eddy currents caused by the pulsed magnetic field
gradients, and possible mechanical instabilities in concentric cylinder
(CC) rheo-cells. These, in particular, hamper quantitative assessment
of spatially resolved velocity profiles needed to construct local
flow curves (LFCs) in CC geometries with millimeter gap sizes. A major
improvement was achieved by chemical shift selective suppression of
signals that are spectroscopically different from the signal of interest.
By also accounting for imperfections in pulsed field gradients, LFCs
were obtained that were virtually free of artifacts. The approach
to obtain quantitative LFCs in millimeter gap CC rheo-MRI cells was
validated for Newtonian and simple yield stress fluids, which both
showed quantitative agreement between local and global flow curves.
No systematic effects of gap size and rotational velocity on the viscosity
of a Newtonian fluid and yield stress of a complex fluid could be
observed. The acquisition of LFCs during heterogeneous and transient
flow of fat crystal dispersion demonstrated that local constitutive
laws can be assessed by rheo-microMRI at a high magnetic field in
a noninvasive, quantitative, and real-time manner.

==== Body
Many colloidal
dispersions express
their intriguing flow properties in a nonlinear relationship between
shear stress and rate. This non-Newtonian flow behavior can be observed
for various food products, body fluids, and materials with designed
functionalities.1−3 The nonlinear relationship between shear stress σ
and rate γ̇ can be summarized in so-called flow curves
σ(γ̇).4,5 These are used to define
constitutive laws for flowing materials and classification of non-Newtonian
behavior.4−10 Well-known classes are shear-thickening or -thinning materials,
for which viscosity, respectively, increases or decreases under shear.
A peculiar case is presented by yield stress fluids, which behave
as elastic solids, when the applied stress is small and as flowing
fluids once a critical stress is exceeded. Macroscopic or global flow
curves are typically measured by conventional rotational rheometers,4,5,8,11 which
vary shear stress as a function of shear rate or vice versa. The flow
behavior of some materials is such that only wall-derived data are
not sufficient to characterize their flow behavior due to heterogeneous
flow and/or transient behavior. There are many example fluids to illustrate
this, in particular for colloidal suspensions in transient yield stress
flow regimes.12−17

This limitation can be overcome by rheo-MRI velocimetry which
can
assess spatially resolved velocities of complex fluids with microscopic
resolution.18−27 In a label-free, real-time, and noninvasive manner, rheo-MRI can
thus uniquely visualize regions governed by different constitutive
laws. When rheo-MRI is performed in a concentric cylinder (CC) or
Couette geometry with a known spatial stress distribution σ(r)
over the gap between the cylinders,28 the
determination of the spatial distribution of the shear rates γ̇(r) opens up the possibility to deduce the constitutive law
in the form of a so-called local flow curve (LFC) σ(γ̇(r)).17,29,30 A main advantage of obtaining LFCs based on rheo-MRI velocimetry
is that they can be obtained in a noninvasive real-time manner, which
allows monitoring of transient changes in non-Newtonian flow behavior
under shear stress. Furthermore, heterogeneous flow in the form of
shear banding,22,23,31−33 wall slip,18,30 and shear-induced migration17,34 can be recognized, which facilitates the identification of the underlying
colloidal mechanisms.

Currently, rheo-MRI based LFCs are typically
obtained using a CC
geometry with centimeter-sized gaps, mounted in wide-bore low-field
magnets (0.5 T), which compromises sensitivity and temporal resolution.10,29,30 Such systems are typically equipped
with low magnetic field gradients (0.05 T/m) and therefore are limited
in providing high spatial resolution as well as in capturing small
amplitude velocities. MRI velocimetry at a high magnetic field strength
B0 (7 T) with strong magnetic field gradients (typically
of the order of 1 T/m) can offer significant
improvements
in performance.21,25,27,35,36 The use of
a higher B0 field enhances sensitivity and temporal resolution.
In addition, the strong gradients allow for the acquisition of profiles
of a large dynamic range in rotational velocities with spatial resolution
down to tens of micrometers. Therefore, we have coined the implementation
at high B0 fields and strong amplitude gradients as rheo-microMRI.
The benefits of rheo-microMRI, however, come at the expense of losing
robustness toward experimental artifacts.37,38

The goal of this work is to show how to recognize and overcome
these artifacts when applied to complex colloidal dispersions. Given
the chemical complexity of such systems, we can expect multiple signals
in the NMR spectrum, which can lead to artifacts due to chemical shift
dispersion at high B0 fields. Several of these artifacts
are well known and have been addressed in the MRI literature before,
also during flow measurements.37,39,40 However, the chemical shift artifacts have not been discussed so
far in relation to spatially resolved velocimetric measurements performed
in a rheo-microMRI setup with millimeter gap-sized CC cells and with
strong magnetic field gradients. In addition, we discuss the implications
of using strong pulsed field gradients during velocimetric measurements
at low rotational velocities, as well as the effects of mechanical
instabilities that become noticeable when highly resolved velocity
profiles are acquired over a millimeter gap-sized CC cell. The suppression
of these artifacts is a prerequisite for obtaining quantitative LFCs.
The validation of the LFCs obtained in the millimeter gap-sized CC
cell is shown for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian yield stress fluids.
The real-time and noninvasive measurements of LFCs by rheo-microMRI
for monitoring structure formation will be demonstrated for a micronized
fat crystal dispersion which undergoes localized transient structural
rearrangements under shear stress.

Materials and Methods
Materials
A commercial olive oil was used as a sample
to discuss chemical shift artifacts that can occur during rheo-microMRI
experiments. Silicone oil standards of different viscosities (500
and 5000 mPa s at 25 °C) (AMETEK Brookfield) were used as Newtonian
fluids. A commercial hair gel was used, where Carbopol was the main
ingredient responsible for its yield stress behavior. Due to the virtual
absence of thixotropy, the hair gel was considered as a simple yield
stress fluid. Micronized fat crystal dispersions were used as a model
for materials with transient yield stress properties. A powder of
micronized fat crystals (MFCs) was dispersed in sunflower oil at a
concentration of 10 w/w%, the full procedure can be found in ref (15). Fat crystal dispersions
were obtained under combined intense mixing and vacuum at 20 °C
during 2 h at constant speed. The fat
dispersions
were immediately frozen after preparation, stored at −20 °C,
and warmed to room temperature before rheo-microMRI and rheology measurements.

High Field Rheo-microMRI
Rheo-microMRI experiments
were conducted on a Bruker Avance III spectrometer, in combination
with a commercial rheo-NMR accessory. A vertically wide bore (89 mm)
superconducting magnet with a magnetic field strength B0 = 7 T, was used, corresponding to a resonance frequency of 300 MHz
for 1H. Excitation and detection of the 1H signal
was performed with a bird-cage rf coil with an inner diameter of 25
mm. In the standard micro-imaging gradient system Micro 2.5 (Bruker),
gradients up to Gmax = 0.987 T/m were
available along all three axes. 1D velocity profiles were measured
with a slice thickness of 1 or 2 mm in two dimensions by a pulsed
gradient spin echo (PGSE) sequence implemented for that purpose (mic_SEFLOW
in ParaVision version 5.1) with Gaussian rf pulses of duration p90 = 1 ms and p180 = 0.59 ms. The velocity-encoding
gradient pulses had a duration of δ = 1 ms, and the observation
time was Δ = 20 or 13.1 ms. The frequency-encoding read gradient
provided a FOV = 25 mm over 512 pixels, such that the spatial resolution
was Δx = 48.8 μm. The time needed to
obtain a single velocity profile within the gap was 3 min 12 s or
1 min 36 s for, respectively, a number of scans of NS = 64 or 32.
The velocity profiles were recorded with an echo time of TE = 17.5 ms (Δ = 13.1 ms) or 24.4
ms (Δ = 20 ms) and a repetition time TR = 1.5 s.

Flow
experiments were performed with concentric cylinder CC (also called
Couette) geometries made from PEEK (Figure 1). Both outer and inner cylinders had serrated
walls with a checkered grid with a depth of 100 μm and a width/height
of approximately 0.5–1 mm to prevent wall slip. The outer cylinder
had a radius of ro = 11 mm suited to the
rf insert used in the MicWB40 microMRI probehead. Three different
inner cylinders of the same length, 58 mm, were used in order to perform
experiments in CC cells with 1, 2.5, and 4 mm gap sizes. The inner
rotating cylinders were hollow and filled with a reference fluid.
Rheo-microMRI velocity profiles, respectively, comprised of 20, 51,
and 81 pixels across the CC gap with (48.8 μm resolution). The
stability of the 1H NMR signal was monitored in order to
ensure that no significant temperature variation occurred during the
performed experiments in the rheo-microMRI CC cells. Standard deviations
of the velocity values were less than 10% and were obtained by repeating
the measurements 3 to 10 times depending on the type of samples and
experimental conditions.

A column is selected by conventional slice selection with two orthogonal
gradients GSlice1 and GSlice2. GFlow and GRead indicate the directions of flow encoding
and read gradients, respectively, which were used to obtain flow as
a function of position r. (b) Rheo-microMRI provides
a spatially resolved 1D intensity profile I(r) and velocity profile v(r) with a 48.8 μm resolution. The velocity profile v(r) is shown as a sketch overlaid on the CC top
view, with maximum velocities (vmax) close
to the rotating inner cylinder and zero velocities close to the static
outer cylinder. The inner rotating cylinder is hollow and can be filled
with a reference fluid (blue). Global rheology provides macroscopic
torque values T as a function of time and rotational
velocity Ω. (c) Equations are used to calculate local shear
rates γ̇(r) from rheo-microMRI velocimetric
measurements and shear stresses σ(r) from global
rheology torque measurements in order to construct a local flow curve
(LFC) σ(γ̇(r)).

Data Processing
All calculations and corrections of
rheo-microMRI velocity profiles, as well as the determination of local
shear rates and stresses, were performed in Matlab-R2015b (MathWorks).
A Savitzky–Golay (SG) FIR smoothing filter (available in Matlab)
was used to obtain the first derivative of the velocity data in order
to calculate the shear rate variations as a function of position in
the gap (Figure 1(c)).
For all experiments, a first-order polynomial fit was used with a
window length set to 5 to 7 points, depending on the gap size. LFC
data points corresponding to the first 2–4 pixels near the
walls (98–195 μm) could not be provided, due to the use
of the SG filter.

An estimation of apparent yield stress σy values was done through a fit of the whole LFC or its parts
with a power law function presenting the Herschel–Bulkley model.
Some of the obtained LFCs could not be fitted by a single power law
function over the whole gap due to banding and were therefore pragmatically
fitted by two or three power law functions with different parameters,
each describing the constitutive law for a band in the gap. ANOVA
tests were performed in Excel.

Rheology Measurements
Rheological measurements were
performed in parallel to rheo-microMRI experiments. They were conducted
on a conventional Modular Compact Rheometer 301 (MCR301, Anton Paar).
Global flow curves and macroscopic torque measurements were done in
a home-built CC cell made from PEEK with exactly the same dimensions
and serrated pattern as the rheo-microMRI CC cell (Figure 1) with 1, 2.5, and 4 mm gap
sizes. In comparison to the rheo-microMRI, the inner cylinders were
solid in the conventional rheological setup. Before every measurement
we verified the rheometer and the home-built CC cell performance with
a standard motor adjustment and an air check as provided by the Rheoplus
software. The macroscopic torque T measurements were
performed using the same conditions and protocols as for rheo-microMRI
velocity measurements. The macroscopic torque T measurements
were collected every 5 s in synchronization with the obtained velocity
profiles.

Results and Discussion
Chemical Shift Artifact
during Velocimetric Measurements
Figure 2 shows the 1H NMR spectrum (a)
and intensity I(r) (b) and velocity v(r) (c) profiles of olive oil obtained
for a 1 mm gap rheo-microMRI
CC cell at constant rotational velocity of Ω = 0.96 rpm. The
intensity and velocity profiles clearly show a chemical shift (CS)
artifact. Such artifacts are well known to occur for systems where
protons have different resonance frequencies due to their different
chemical environments and have been discussed thoroughly in the literature.27,38−41 For the shown 1H NMR spectrum, we can indeed distinguish
different proton signals with a maximal CS difference of 1200 Hz (4
ppm) (Figure 2(a)).
We observed a CS displacement of 25 pixels at the chosen receiver
bandwidth of BW = 25 kHz and matrix size of N = 512.
(Figure 2(b) and (c)).
The observed CS artifact in the intensity and velocity profiles is
the result of spatial mismapping of the MR signal based on its spectroscopic
frequency, which typically will be seen in the read direction (GRead) (Figure 1). This mismapping can be reduced by increasing the
receiver bandwidth (BW), which results in an increased spectral width
per pixel for a given matrix size. In practice, the increase in BW
has to be accounted for by an increased read gradient (GRead) to obtain the same field of view (FOV) and spatial
resolution. Figure 3 demonstrates how the CS artifact, clearly observed in rheo-microMRI
intensity and velocity profiles at a BW of 25 kHz, was improved by
increasing the BW up to 125 kHz (the full set of the rheo-MRI data
as a function of the BW can be found in Figure S1). Even though the broadening of the profiles decreased significantly
and the deviation from the expected position became less, the CS artifact
is still noticeable (about 5 pixels). A further increase in BW values
up to 250 kHz reduced the shift to 3 pixels (Figure S1).

Figure 2 1H NMR spectrum and chemical shift artifacts observed
during rheo-microMRI measurements of olive oil at a magnetic field
strength of B0 of 7 T. In the 1H NMR spectrum,
(a) the maximal chemical shift difference of 4 ppm is indicated by
the black arrow. The indicated chemical shift caused artifacts in
normalized intensity I(r) (b) and
velocity v(r) (c) profiles. These
appear as additional signals, shifted to the right part, of the profiles
(black dotted lines are intended to guide the eye). The intensity I(r) (b) and velocity v(r) (c) profiles were obtained as a function of
position r in a 1 mm gap CC rheo-microMRI cell at
a constant rotational velocity of Ω = 0.96 rpm. The profiles
were measured with a pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) sequence with
Δ = 15 ms and a receiver BW of 25 kHz.

Figure 3 Example
of a chemical shift artifact and its minimization by increasing
the receiver bandwidth (BW) and use of a chemical shift suppression
CHESS module: zoomed in normalized intensity (a) and velocity (b)
profiles of olive oil obtained at B0 = 7 T as a function
of BW when using a pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) sequence (squares)
and one modified with a CHESS selection module (lines). All profiles
were obtained at a rotational velocity of Ω = 0.96 rpm in a
1 mm gap CC rheo-microMRI cell.

The chemical shift artifact can also be minimized by selecting
the proton signal of interest or by suppressing unwanted proton signals.
For our experimental setup, we found that the suppression of unwanted
peaks was a more efficient approach than selective excitation (Figure S2). To implement the chemical shift suppression
approach, we added a CHESS39,42,43 module before the flow encoding a pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE)
sequence (Figure S3). Three CHESS pulses with frequency selective
90° rf pulses for unwanted proton frequencies in combination
with spoiler gradients effectively suppress signals from protons different
from the on-resonance one that should remain. For olive oil, we applied
90° pulses with a bandwidth of 1000 Hz on resonance for protons
at a chemical shift difference of 4.2 ppm (Figure 2(a)), suppressing signals between 2.5 and
5.7 ppm. The resulting velocity and density profiles are shown in Figure 3. Significantly improved
profiles were obtained even for a BW of 25 kHz. However, a chemical
shift displacement of 6 pixels was still observed in the acquired
profiles, which were attributed to protons being 1 ppm off-resonance
and therefore not suppressed. The chemical shift artifact still appeared
on the edges of the intensity and velocity profiles and should not
be understood as wall slip. Hence, we deployed the CHESS suppression
pulses in combination with an increased BW (Figure S1). At a BW of 125 kHz, we observed well-defined rectangular
intensity and straight velocity profiles (Figure 3, red line). The broadening due to CS dispersion
now hardly affected the rheo-microMRI measurements.

We note
that in previous work we used a different strategy by combining
the PGSE with a chemical shift suppression module consisting of a
series of frequency-selective 90o pulses with a time separation
of 5 × T2 between them.44 In hindsight,
we found no clear advantage to the simpler CHESS suppression approach.
Here, we have experimentally demonstrated that a conventional CHESS
module provides an effective alternative for reducing chemical shift
artifacts.

Artifacts Occurring during Velocimetric Measurements
at Low
Rotational Velocities
Velocimetric measurements at low rotational
velocities Ω, as implemented on our commercial rheo-microMRI
setup, required us to work at the edge of possible experimental settings
for observation time Δ, flow encoding GFlow, and flow compensated GFC gradients
(Figure S3). These conditions resulted
in velocity profiles with artifacts that were enhanced at short flow
encoding time (small Δ) and large gradient values, which were
intrinsic to the pulse sequence. We distinguished artifacts related
to gradient imperfections and to mechanical instabilities of the used
rheo-microMRI setup.

The gradient-related artifacts appeared
in noncentered and nonsymmetric velocity profiles with negative velocities
on one side and unrealistically high velocities on another side (Figure S4). The generated artifacts can be seen
more clearly if we perform velocimetric measurements at zero rotational
velocity (Figure S5). This artifact does
not relate to the flow itself and shows a first-order linear phase
shift which can be corrected for. The shift of the velocity data is
likely to be caused by a phase shift related to technical imperfections
of the gradient systems such as eddy currents.40,45 One route to minimize the influence of these artifacts is to record
the velocities at reduced GFlow gradient
strength. For our commercial rheo-microMRI setup and its related sequences
to measure flow, however, the implementation of GFC gradients along the read direction (Figure S3) forced us to use a short observation time (Δ)
leading to strong GFlow gradients to record
low velocities.19 Once the GFC gradients were disabled, by modifying the pulse sequence,
a longer Δ could be used, which resulted in a reduction in GFlow and an increase in sensitivity of the velocimetric
measurements at low rotational velocities Ω.

As a workaround
for the non-flow related phase shifts, a correction
of the (phase-shifted) noncentered velocity profile was used in postprocessing.
This approach is based on the expected velocity profile for the rotating
inner cylinder of the rheo-MRI CC cell, which is supposed to be centered
and linear as a function of position r (Figure S4). First, a theoretical velocity profile
was calculated based on the actual applied velocities and was centered,
considering the symmetry of the CC cell. Next, the measured velocities
of the inner cylinder were analyzed by a linear fit. The fitted and
theoretical velocity profiles for the rotating inner cylinder were
extrapolated over the whole dimension of the rheo-cell (FOV 25 mm).
The difference between them was used to correct the initially measured
velocity profile, including velocities within the gaps. The correction
resulted in well-centered and symmetric velocity profiles (Figure S4).

The above-mentioned remedies
also alleviated the impact of mechanical
instabilities due to wobbling of the rotating inner cylinder of the
CC cell (Figure S6(a)). Reducing the gradient
strengths of GFlow by increasing the observation
time Δ effectively reduced the impact of wobbling on the velocity
profile (Figure S6(b). This approach turned
out to be more effective in suppressing the wobbling artifact and
less time consuming than using a trigger to record velocity profiles
in sync with the rotation of the inner cylinder (Figure S6(c)).

Recently, the effects of curved streamlines
in relation to slice
thicknesses as they occur in millimeter-sized gaps of CC cells on
the accuracy of the velocity profiles have been discussed,20,34 and the chosen slice thickness of 1–2 mm was in line with
the recommendations that were made. Therefore, in our current work,
we can assume that the impact of curved stream lines was minor.

Local Flow Curves: Validation for Wide Gap CC (Couette) Geometry
The previously described approaches to obtain artifact free rheo-MRI
velocity profiles for fluids in CC cells at high magnetic field strength
opened up the possibility to obtain LFCs in a quantitative manner.30 First, shear rate profiles γ̇(r) were deduced from rheo-MRI velocity profiles according
to the equation γ̇(r) = r ∂(v(r)/r)/∂r (Figure 1(c)). Macroscopic torque T values
were obtained with an identical CC cell mounted in a conventional
rotational rheometer and allowed for the calculation of shear stress
as a function of position using σ(r) = T/2πHr2 (Figure 1(c)), where H is the fluid height in the gap, and r is the position
within the gap. This equation is obtained from the momentum equation
assuming the absence of significant normal stress differences, edge
effects, and fluid inertia.6,28 We used different gap
sizes to vary the shear stress field which is a function of the gap
size and position as in σ(r) = σiri2/r2, where σi is the stress exerted by the rotating inner cylinder, and ri the radius of the inner cylinder. By using
rheo-microMRI CC cells with gap sizes of 1, 2.5, and 4 mm, shear stress
variations of 17%, 40%, and 60% could be applied, respectively.

This approach was validated by a comparison of LFCs with global flow
curves for silicone oil and a commercial Carbopol dispersion (hair
gel) as examples of Newtonian and yield stress fluids, respectively.
These model fluids were selected since their flow behavior is neither
heterogeneous nor time dependent. That made them well suited to validate
the approach to obtain quantitative LFCs, since these should be identical
to the global flow curves obtained by a conventional rotational rheometer.

Figure 4(a) shows
global flow curves for silicone oil, displaying the expected linear
behavior for a Newtonian fluid. The LFCs measured for silicone oil
in CC cells all overlap with the global flow curves for the applied
gap sizes (1, 2.5, and 4 mm) and the applied rotational velocities
Ω between 1 and 32 rpm. We conducted a two-way ANOVA test to
evaluate the effects of the method used (GFC vs LFC) and the gap with
(1, 2.5, and 4 mm) on the estimated viscosity values of silicone oil.
There was no significant effect of the applied method and gap width
on viscosity (at α = 0.05, Table S1). The precisions of the two methods were however different, based
on 95% confidence intervals of the means (viscosities obtained by
GFC and LFC were, respectively, 0.512 ± 0.007 and 0.562 ±
0.069). Based on this two-way ANOVA test, we concluded that the estimated
viscosities obtained by GFC and LFC were not statistically different
from each other. These methods only differed with respect to measurement
precision. The high precision of the viscosity as determined by GFC
is in line with the experimentally determined relative standard deviation
of 1% for silicone oil on this rheometer, as verified by the supplier
of the instrument. We deem the lower precision of the viscosities
obtained from LFCs acceptable for practical applications. In our second
ANOVA test, we tested LFCs for the influence of gap width (2.5, 4.0
mm) and rotation velocity (Ω = 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 rpm) on the estimated
viscosity of the silicone oil. ANOVA showed there was no significant
effect of gap width and rotation speed on viscosities obtained by
LFCs. No systematic effect of gap width and Ω was present, as
these were estimated as random factors in the ANOVA analysis (Tables S1 and S2). This demonstrates that LFCs
can be obtained in a quantitative manner for practically relevant
gap sizes and shear rate conditions. This agreement was also observed
for the hair gel (Figure 4(b)), where the applied rotational velocities Ω were
varied between 1 and 150 rpm. For this Carbopol dispersion, the global
flow curve can be well fitted with a single power law function and
be described with Herschel–Bulkley behavior, as expected for
a simple yield stress fluid.8,46,47 The good match between the GFC and respective LFCs in Figure 4 is reflected in the small
(<10%) variation of the yield stress obtained by the Herschel–Bulkley
model for these two methods, as well as gap width and Ω (Table S3). This validates that quantification
of complex material properties can be performed via rheo-microMRI.

Figure 4 Local
and global flow curves obtained for silicone oil (a) and
hair gel (b), respectively, representing Newtonian and yield stress
fluids. The local flow curves (LFC) σ(γ̇(r)) were
obtained with applied rotational velocities Ω displayed in the
legend. To aid the visualization, the local and global flow curves
obtained in CC cells with different gap sizes (1, 2.5, and 4 mm) are
presented with an offset (multiplication factors are indicated in
the plot).

Local Flow Curves: A Local
View on Transient Structure Formation
and Degradation
The potential of real-time assessment of
LFCs by rheo-microMRI was demonstrated for a dispersion of micronized
fat crystals (MFCs) in sunflower oil, which is known to form a network
under low shear15,48 (Figure 5). The MFC dispersion was measured in a 2.5
mm gap-sized rheo-MRI CC cell at a rotational velocity of Ω
= 0.96 rpm for 13 h. The velocity profiles, recorded every 5 min,
showed a continuous development of heterogeneous flow behavior within
the gap during whole experiment (Figure S7). In parallel, the same dispersion was placed into an identical
CC cell mounted in a commercial rheometer to measure T values over the same time frame, imposed at constant rotational
velocity Ω. The evolution of torque T demonstrated
three stages: an increase during the first 3 h, a fast decrease within
the next 4 h, and a subsequent slow decrease (Figure S8). This pattern could be interpreted as initial formation
of the MFC network followed by subsequent disruption.15,48 The corresponding time-dependent LFCs are shown in Figure 5(a), and they point to the
development of a yield stress fluid. The LFCs could not be fitted
with a single Herschel–Bulkley model over the whole range of
shear rates for most of the time points, which indicates that the
MFC dispersion at different positions in the CC gap was governed by
different constitutive laws. The LFCs, however, could be described
by a two (or even three) component Herschel–Bulkley models,
correlated to different bands in the CC gap (Figure S9). To find an interpretation for the multicomponent LFCs,
the different regions were then fitted with a power law function representing
the Herschel–Bulkley model. In this way, local yield stress
values σy over the gap were estimated. The results
are presented as a function of time in the two-dimensional map in Figure 5(b). Initially, for
all positions over the gap, an overall increase in apparent yield
stress σy could be observed, indicating formation
of a MFC network. The map also shows that this increase in yield stress
was heterogeneous over the gap. For two positions at different distances
from the rotating inner cylinder ri (light
and dark blue columns indicate these positions in Figure 5(b)), we have plotted the local
time dependences of σy (Figure 5(c) and (d)). One can observe that for the
position close to the inner rotating cylinder the apparent yield stress
σy was always overcome by a larger local shear stress
σ (Figure 5(c)).
Further away from the rotating cylinder, the apparent yield stress
σy became too high to be overcome by the local stress
after 5–6 h (Figure 5(d)). Hence, after this period, this region became stagnant
(hatched area in Figure 5(b)). In Figure 5(c)
and (d), we have also presented the local effective viscosity μeff(r) = σ(r)/γ̇(r). In the region near the rotating inner wall, we observed
an increase in μeff, followed by a decrease. This
was similar to our previous results obtained in a 1 mm gap with a
much more homogeneous stress distribution, where it was concluded
that the rapid increase in the apparent σy corresponded to the formation of a weak-link MFC network,15 followed by a decrease corresponding to its
disruption due to recrystallization and aggregation of the MFCs.48 In the wider CC gap, a static band appeared
in time in the region near the outer wall (Figure 5(d)), where the MFC network can continue
to grow in strength. These results illustrate the potential of rheo-microMRI
for assessment of time-dependent and spatially heterogeneous constitutive
laws. Reproducibile network formation in CC cells was observed for
dispersions of MFCs in sunflower and bean oils measured in 1, 2.5,
and 4 mm gap-sized rheo-MRI CC cells at rotational velocities of 0.96
and 3 rpm.

Figure 5 (a) Evolution of local flow curve (LFC) σ(γ̇(r)) reflecting network formation of micronized fat crystals
in sunflower oil under shear stress at a rotational velocity of Ω
= 0.96 rpm in a rheo-microMRI CC cell with a 2.5 mm gap size. (b)
2D map of the yield stress σy, resulting from a power
law fit, as a function of position within the gap and time. The hatched
area indicates regions with no flow. Colored lines indicate how regions
in panel (b) corresponded to LFCs in panel (a). For two positions,
indicated with light and dark blue columns, the local yield stress
and effective viscosity μeff were plotted as a function
of time in respectively (c) and (d).

We note that in our approach we did not measure the macroscopic
torque Tin situ in a CC cell mounted
in a MRI probehead. Current designs for in situ torque
measurement in a CC cell in a superconducting magnet are compromised
by the long shaft and consequent mechanical instabilities,49 which limits the operational range of Ω
and T. Our approach employing two parallel measurements
delivered reproducible results for a wide range of rotational velocities
(Ω = 0.1–150 rpm) and torques (T = 0.01–100
mN m) and can be implemented in a straightforward manner in laboratories
equipped with a standard wide bore, high field, NMR spectrometer,
equipped with a microMRI probehead and a commercial rotational rheometer
using the same rheo cell.

Conclusions
Chemical
shift artifacts in rheo-microMRI at a high B0 field can
be minimized by introducing CHESS pulses to suppress unwanted
proton signals. By also accounting for eddy currents generated by
pulsed field gradients, velocity profiles can be obtained that are
virtually free of artifacts. This allows for construction of LFCs
which quantitatively match global flow curves for Newtonian and simple
yield stress fluids. No systematic effects of gap size and rotational
velocities on the viscosity of a Newtonian fluid and yield stress
of a complex fluid could be observed. The approach allows for assessment
of the transient local constitutive laws for micronized fat crystal
dispersion that undergo structural rearrangements in a CC cell under
shear stress.
