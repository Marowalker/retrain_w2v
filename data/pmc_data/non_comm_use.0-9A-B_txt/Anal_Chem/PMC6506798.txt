Recent technological
advances have made it possible to investigate
the hitherto rather elusive protein histidine phosphorylation. However,
confident site-specific localization of protein histidine phosphorylation
remains challenging. Here, we address this problem, presenting a mass-spectrometry-based
approach that outperforms classical HCD fragmentation without compromising
sensitivity. We use the phosphohistidine immonium ion as a diagnostic
tool as well as ETD-based fragmentation techniques to achieve unambiguous
identification and localization of histidine-phosphorylation sites.
The work presented here will allow more confident investigation of
the phosphohistidine proteome to reveal the roles of histidine phosphorylation
in cellular signaling events.

Through chemical
alteration
of the nature of protein surfaces, reversible protein phosphorylation
constitutes the primary means of regulating protein activity and is
thus regarded as one of the most important protein post-translational
modifications (PTMs).1−4 Compared with the well-studied phosphohydroxyamino acids (serine,
threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation or pSTY), histidine phosphorylation
(pHis) has received much less attention and was for a long-time considered
an archaic type of modification. Over recent years, it has become
apparent that protein histidine phosphorylation also occurs in higher
organisms, and its biological functions have started to become unraveled,5,6 underlining the importance of overcoming technical challenges hampering
the study of the histidine phosphoproteome. Fortunately, some novel
analytical tools allowing the enrichment and detection of the labile
phosphohistidine have been developed,7−9 opening the way to in-depth
investigations. Antibody-based approaches pointed to a potential role
of histidine phosphorylation in cell-cycle regulation,7 as well as to potential oncogenicity of pHis deregulation,10 but these antibodies are so far not well-suited
for the enrichment of pHis phosphopeptides. We recently demonstrated
that under optimized conditions, immobilized-metal affinity chromatography
(Fe3+-IMAC) can be used to enrich histidine phosphorylated
peptides along with pSTY peptides.9 Despite
the fact that the first obstacle concerning the enrichment of pHis
peptides seems to be largely tackled, the validation of identified
phosphohistidine sites remains challenging. Because of a relatively
low activation barrier, neutral loss of the phosphate group is a dominant
dissociation pathway upon collision-induced dissociation (CID), complicating
phosphosite localization.11 This issue,
inherent to the localization of most phosphorylation events, is even
more prominent in the case of histidine phosphorylation, as the chemical
nature of the phosphorus–nitrogen bond results in extensive
neutral losses upon fragmentation as well as in potential gas-phase
rearrangement.12 Moreover, it has been
demonstrated that confident localization of phosphosites after CID
fragmentation becomes more challenging when the number of residues
that may harbor a phosphate moiety increases.13,14 In the human proteome, His has a relative low frequency of occurrence
(∼3%), as compared with Ser (∼8%) and Thr (∼6%).
It is then not surprising that the so-far reported pHis peptides often
additionally harbor one or more Ser and Thr residues, enhancing the
risk of false-positive identification and hampering correct phosphosite
localization. The low confidence in the pHis events identified constitutes
to this day one of the biggest hurdles in the investigation of the
biological functions of histidine phosphorylation, and thus tools
validating identified pHis phosphosites are seriously needed.

Experimental
Section
All peptides were synthesized on the basis of the
Fmoc-based solid-phase
synthesis strategy. Potassium phosphoramidate (PPA) was synthesized
according to Wei and Matthews15 (see the Supporting Information for more details). Escherichia coli strain BL21DE3 was grown in M9 minimal
medium with 0.5% additional glucose at 37 °C. Cells were
collected and lysed in lysis buffer with subsequent sonication. Next,
methanol–chloroform protein precipitation was performed, and
the protein precipitate was then digested overnight at room temperature.
Fe3+-IMAC enrichment was performed as described previously16 (see the Supporting Information for more details). Nanoflow LC-MS/MS was performed by coupling an
Agilent 1290 (Agilent Technologies, Middelburg, Netherlands) to an
Orbitrap Fusion Lumos or an Orbitrap Q-Exactive HF (Thermo Scientific,
Bremen, Germany). The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent
acquisition mode. Several parameters were optimized for the immonium-triggering
method using synthetic pHis peptides and can be found in Table S4 (see the Supporting Information for more details). Raw data files were processed
using the MaxQuant23 software (ver. 1.5.3.30)
and searched against the Swissprot E. coli K12 database
(4434 entries) in the case of synthetic pHis peptides and the Swissprot
+ TrEMBL E. coli BL21DE3 database (4294 entries)
in the case of the endogenous pHis peptides. The false-discovery rate
was set to 1%, a score cutoff of 40 in the case of modified peptides
was used, and the minimum peptide length was set to seven residues
(see the Supporting Information for more
details).

Results and Discussion
In comparison with the commonly
studied phosphohydroxyamino acids
(pSTY), it has earlier been reported that phosphohistidine peptides
are more susceptible to exhibiting triplets of neutral losses (i.e.,
HPO3, H2PO4, and H3PO5) from the precursor ion upon low-energy CID.17 Here, we found that a similar prevalence of neutral-loss
triplets is observed when endogenous pHis peptides are subjected to
higher-energy-collisional-dissociation (HCD) fragmentation (Figure 1A and Table S1). However, despite the fact that pHis
peptides are more prone to exhibiting triplets of neutral losses upon
fragmentation, it does not constitute an indisputable diagnostic tool,
as only 30% of the PSMs matching phosphohistidine peptides exhibit
neutral-loss triplets. More importantly, neutral-loss triplets were
also observed in approximately 10% of the spectra deriving from pST
phosphopeptides. We also report here that reversed-phase-liquid-chromatography
(RP-LC) retention times can be used to differentiate histidine phosphorylated
peptides from STY phosphorylated isoforms, as synthetic pHis phosphopeptides
elute predominantly later than their pSTY counterparts (Figure 1B and Table S2). This is in agreement with the fact that nonmodified histidine
is the amino acid residue that contributes the least to peptide retention
on C18 material,13 and histidine phosphorylation
is thus likely to result in an increase in retention time, possibly
through charge neutralization.18 However,
a validation strategy based on synthetic peptides requires the prior
correct identification of phosphohistidine peptides and, evidently,
the synthesis of all pHis peptide candidates as well as all their
pSTY isoforms, which is costly and time-consuming.

triplets (i.e., 80, 96, and 116 Da,
respectively) prevalently, although not exclusively, observed in spectra
derived from HCD fragmentation of pHis peptides. Here, the percentages
of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) corresponding to endogenous class
I phosphopeptides (MaxQuant localization probability ≥0.75)
identified in E. coli samples that exhibit neutral
losses are displayed for pHis and pSTY peptides. (B) Synthetic phosphohistidine
peptides (purple dots) generally eluting later than their pSTY counterparts

Phosphohistidine Immonium Ion as a True Diagnostic-Marker Ion
We demonstrated earlier that pHis immonium fragment ions are sometimes
detected in the MS/MS spectra of pHis peptides.9 We then observed that the chance of detecting the phosphohistidine
immonium ion is strongly dependent on the pHis-site position within
the peptide and on the phosphopeptide abundance.9 In these earlier studies, only one-third of the identified
histidine phosphorylated endogenous bacterial peptides exhibited the
pHis-diagnostic immonium ion (m/z 190.0376). Still, this finding spurred us to investigate ways to
increase the probability of detecting the pHis immonium ion, as well
as the presence of any other potential diagnostic ions in mass spectra
originating from synthetic and endogenous pHis peptides. To do so,
60 peptides harboring previously identified pHis sites were chemically
phosphorylated on histidine residues following the protocol of Wei
and Matthews15 (Table S3). Binning of the low-mass region of the resulting MS2 spectra
revealed another unique fragment ion at m/z 218.032, corresponding to sequential b-type and y-type
cleavages of pHis peptides. Importantly, low-mass binning of MS2 spectra
derived from the analysis of full proteome samples and histidine-phosphorylation-depleted
endogenous human phosphoenriched samples validated the specificity
of these two marker ions (Figure S1). Because
of the overall lower probability of observing the m/z 218.032 ion, we next focused exclusively on the m/z 190.0376 ion to develop a more robust
diagnostic tool.

Optimized Settings for the Detection of the
pHis Immonium Ion
Fragmentation pathways and fragment abundances
heavily depend on
collision-energy settings. For instance, the phosphotyrosine-immonium-ion
intensity increases with increasing collision energy.19 Here we found that the probability of detecting the two
pHis marker ions is dependent on the HCD normalized-collision-energy
(NCE) value and that incremental increases of the NCE value lead to
an increase in the number of observed occurrences of the pHis immonium
ion (Figure S2A). As expected, such high
HCD collision energies led to peptide overfragmentation, impairing
the ability to sequence the peptides by standard database search engines.
We consequently developed an acquisition method relying on an initial
high-energy-HCD-fragmentation step, followed by high-quality triggered
MS2 scans with ETD-based fragmentation only when the pHis immonium
ion is detected (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Phosphohistidine-immonium-ion-triggering method. The initial step
consists of recording a high-energy-HCD-fragmentation spectrum, which
is used to detect the pHis immonium marker ion. Upon detection of
this diagnostic ion, the same precursor is subjected to ETD-based
fragmentation, achieving improved peptide-sequence coverage while
preserving the histidine phosphorylation.

Immonium-Ion-Triggered EThcD Fragmentation Allowing Unambiguous
pHis-Site Localization
It has been well-documented that electron-transfer-dissociation
(ETD) techniques allow better preservation of labile phosphorylations,
but the fragmentation efficiency highly depends on the precursor’s
charge density.11,20 For this reason, supplemental
activation is beneficial for low-charge peptides. In our case, ETD-only
fragmentation was used for precursors of charges superior or equal
to 4, and ETD with supplemental HCD fragmentation21 (EThcD) was used for precursors of charges 2 and 3. This
triggering strategy enable circumventing a drawback of ETD-based fragmentation
(i.e., the low sampling rate limiting the depth of ETD experiments).

In addition to the collision energy, other settings were also optimized
for the initial high-energy-HCD-fragmentation step, including the
scan range, the Orbitrap mass resolution, the automatic-gain-control
target (AGC, the setting allowing the determination of the number
of charges to be accumulated before fragmentation), and the maximum
injection time. A narrow scan range centered on the immonium-ion m/z as well as an Orbitrap resolution of
30k appeared to be optimal for maximizing the number of detected occurrences
of the pHis diagnostic ions (Figure S2B,C). No significant differences in the numbers of pHis sites (Figure S3) or pHis peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs, Figure 3A) were observed
between NCE values of 50 and 60 at the tested AGC target values, and
thus an NCE value of 55 was chosen. The dependence of our approach
on the number of precursor ions accumulated was more critical. Logically,
low values of AGC targets resulted in significant drops in pHis-identification
numbers. It however appeared that no significant difference was observed
when the AGC target value was doubled from 5 × 104 to 1 × 105 charges (Figure 3A). These AGC target settings are similar
to the values used in standard (phospho)proteomics high-speed acquisition
methods with Orbitrap readout. The immonium-triggering method thus
enables the use of ETD-based fragmentation techniques without sacrificing
too much of the acquisition speed and thus the sensitivity. The final
optimal parameters in the current method are summarized in Table S4. Our optimized method led to the correct
sequencing of ca. 90% of the 60 synthetic pHis peptides in a single
LC-MS/MS run (Table S5). Notably, the immonium-ion-triggering
method outperformed HCD fragmentation for the analysis of the synthetic
pHis peptides, in terms of identification numbers and identification
scores (Figure S4). The primary purpose
of this study is to improve localization confidence of histidine phosphosites.
Besides using the immonium ion as a signature for the presence of
histidine phosphorylation, this method uses ETD-based fragmentation
techniques, which are well-known to result in higher phosphosite-localization
confidence.21,22 This is here reiterated by the
fact that our method also outperforms HCD in terms of localization
probabilities (Figure 3B). Consequently, the immonium-triggering method yielded 37% more
pHis-site identifications than HCD at a MaxQuant-localization-probability
cutoff of 0.9 (Figure 3C and Table S6).

Immonium-Ion Triggering
Allowing Correct Site Localization in
Complex Samples
Following this optimization, we next applied
our method to biological samples. We chose to study Escherichia
coli, as histidine phosphorylation plays known important
roles in this system, and we were able to confidently identify 80
pHis sites (Table S7) by combining the
Fe3+-IMAC enrichment protocol with the here presented immonium-ion-triggering
method. For comparison, a previously reported strategy using a combination
of pHis antibodies and neutral-loss triggering enabled the identification
of 15 pHis sites in E. coli.17 More than the number of pHis sites identified, the high confidence
of the histidine-phosphosite identification and localization constitutes
the real strength and novelty of the method presented here. This is
exemplified by comparing our results to our previously reported E. coli data set, in which we identified a similar number
of pHis sites per growth condition.9 However,
when comparing the distributions of the localization scoring for these
identified endogenous peptides, it appears that the triggering method
significantly enhanced the confident localization of pHis sites (Figure 3D). HCD fragmentation
performed significantly worse for endogenous pHis peptides compared
with for synthetic pHis peptides, which we attribute to the higher
dynamic range and complexity of the endogenous sample, resulting in
the generation of lower-quality MS2 spectra (Figure 3B,D). Our method enabled improved sequence
coverage while preserving the labile histidine phosphorylation, as
illustrated, for instance, by the identification of the His20 phosphosite
on TufA–TufB and the His44 phosphosite on LysU (Figure 4A), which both harbor numerous
amino acids that could accept a phosphate moiety. Examples of confident
localization of histidine phosphorylation within peptides presenting
adjacent putative phosphosites further emphasize the strength of the
immonium-triggering method. Attributing the phosphosite on the DHTSDQLHEEFDAK
phosphopeptide, belonging to the lysine–tRNA ligase (LysU)
protein, is very challenging by HCD, because of the close proximity
of the histidine, serine, and threonine residues. Using HCD, the phosphosite
was previously assigned to the Thr45 residue.9 Here, we enhanced the MaxQuant-localization-probability score from
0.04 to 0.99 by utilizing EThcD instead of HCD, validating that the
phosphorylation is undoubtedly localized at the His44 residue (Figure 4B). Similarly, the
phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent-phosphotransferase-system protein (PtsP)
is known to be phosphorylated on its active site His356. In our earlier
report,9 we were unable to confidently
localize this histidine phosphosite, as the algorithm either reported
high-confidence phosphorylation on the adjacent Ser355 or was unable
to assign the phosphosite. As shown in Figure S5, the immonium-ion-triggering method in combination with
EThcD enabled the confident localization of the phosphorylation site
on His356, as both the y- and z-ion series are complete, without neutral
losses. As a final example, the phosphorylation of the His83 of the
GatY protein, a residue responsible for zinc chelation, was not confidently
identified by HCD because of the presence of adjacent potential phosphorylation-acceptor
sites, whereas the immonium-ion-triggering method permitted, once
again, unambiguous localization (Figure S6).

Figure 4 (A) Triggered ETD fragmentation of a phosphorylated peptide of
the TufA–TufB proteins enabling the unambiguous localization
of the phosphorylation site on the His20 residue because of the full
sequence coverage and absence of neutral losses. (B) Triggered EThcD
fragmentation of a phosphorylated peptide belonging to the LysU protein
clearly pointing toward phosphorylation of His44. HCD fragmentation
localized it to the adjacent threonine.

Conclusion
To summarize, we presented evidence that
an optimized novel phosphohistidine-immonium-ion-triggering
method can be used to extend the coverage of the still largely elusive
phosphohistidine proteome. By combining two layers of evidence (i.e.,
the presence of the immonium diagnostic ion and the use of ETD-based
fragmentation techniques), this method enhances confident identification
of protein histidine phosphosites. Current knowledge of the biological
role of histidine phosphorylation, in prokaryotes but also in eukaryotes,
represents only the tip of the iceberg. In our view, our method should
help the community gain in-depth insight in the biological function
and abundance of histidine phosphorylation in organisms across the
whole tree of life.
