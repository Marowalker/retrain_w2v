The synthetic protocol for preparation
of 1-13C-phosphoenolpyruvate-d2, precursor for parahydrogen-induced polarization
(PHIP) of 1-13C-phospholactate-d2, is reported. 13C nuclear spin polarization of 1-13C-phospholactate-d2 was increased
by >30,000,000-fold (5.75 mT) in water. The reported 13C polarization level approaching unity (>15.6%), long lifetime
of 13C hyperpolarized 1-13C-phospholactate-d2 (58 ± 4 s versus 36 ± 2 s for nondeuterated
form at 47.5 mT), and large production quantities (52 μmoles
in 3 mL) in aqueous medium make this compound useful as a potential
contrast agent for the molecular imaging of metabolism and other applications.

Hyperpolarized
(HP) 13C magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has evolved from
proof-of-principle
studies1,2 to clinical trials over the past decade.3 The high sensitivity of HP MRI was the main driving
force behind its application for metabolic imaging. Indeed, HP MRI
provides several orders of magnitude signal enhancement over the conventional
MRI. Furthermore, HP MRI permits fast imaging of HP contrast agents
and their metabolites within the time scale of the hyperpolarization
decay, e.g., 1–3 min in vivo.4−6 Monitoring the metabolic signatures of HP contrast agents7 allows one to interrogate disease aggressiveness,
progression, and response to treatment.

While dissolution dynamic
nuclear polarization (DNP) is the most
widely used hyperpolarization method at present,1 parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP)8 is an alternative approach, which enables HP contrast agent
preparation in less than 1 min.4,5 PHIP is a chemical method
relying on ultrafast molecular hydrogenation of an unsaturated precursor
with parahydrogen enabled by Rh(I) catalysts, Figure 1.6,9 The use of hyperpolarization techniques
for bioimaging requires a relatively long lifetime of the HP state in vivo, which historically has been demonstrated with isolated 13C sites in biomolecules, e.g., 13C carboxyl sites
without directly attached protons with in vivo13C T1 > 20 s.3 Isotopic enrichment with ∼99% 13C is
mandatory to boost the sensitivity of the contrast agent by increasing
the payload of HP 13C magnetization per μmole of
injected agent. In the PHIP process, the long-lived 13C
sites J-coupled to nascent parahydrogens are hyperpolarized
using polarization transfer from the parahydrogens to 13C, Figure 1. In addition to the mandatory 13C10,11 labeling of carboxyl carbon adjacent
to the double or triple carbon–carbon bond required for molecular
addition of parahydrogen,10,11 the spin system of
the hydrogenated molecule often benefits from simplification to three
spins via deuteration: two parahydrogen protons and a 13C nucleus, Figure 1. This deuteration of the
precursor molecules also lengthens the 13C relaxation times T1 of HP states.12−14

Despite the synthetic challenges related to deuterium
and 13C enrichments, several contrast agents such as 2-hydroxy-ethyl
propionate-1-13C,2,3,3-d3 (HEP),
1-13C-succinate,12−14 tetrafluoropropyl propionate-1-13C,2,3,3-d3 (TFPP),15,1615N-propargylcholine,17 and
1-13C-phospholactate18 have
been demonstrated. HEP,19 1-13C-succinate-d2,12−14 and TFPP15,16 have been used for in vivo metabolic imaging of
vasculature, cancer, and plaque lipid content, respectively.

The recently introduced concept of −OH protection of the
C=C–OH moiety18,20 expanded the number
of potential PHIP-based HP contrast agents. HP 1-13C-phospholactate
(PLAC)18,21 is particularly attractive, Figure 1, because it can be rapidly dephosphorylated to
HP 1-13C-lactate by blood phosphatases.21 Therefore, bioavailable 1-13C-lactate can be
prepared by the PHIP method. HP lactate22−25 elevation in cancer cells enables in vivo metabolic imaging using injection of HP 1-13C-lactate.26,27

A low polarization level
of ∼1% has been the main obstacle
for use of HP PLAC, Figure 1. Here, a significantly
greater polarization level and larger-scale production for HP PLAC
is demonstrated by using fully deuterated PHIP precursor, 1-13C-phosphoenolpyruvate-d2 (1-13C-PEP-d2), and higher hydrogenation reaction
temperature, respectively. Finally, a complete synthetic methodology
for preparation of 1-13C-PEP-d2 is reported.

Results and Discussion
Commercial
phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) has been previously synthesized
by the Hirschbein procedure,28 where pyruvic
acid is the starting material. It has also been shown that protons
of pyruvic acid can be exchanged by deuterons of D2O.29,30 However, the product, pyruvic-d3 acid,
was either used in situ(30) or prepared with low yield.29 For example,
the actual yield of the pure deuterated product was not reported,
and the yield of a crude material was <50%.29 Moreover, only modest isotopic purity of 70% of pyruvic-d3 acid was achieved. Therefore, a more efficient
exchange procedure was required for preparation of 1-13C-PEP-d2. The exchange procedure shown
in Figure 2a was developed after several model
experiments with unlabeled pyruvic acid. In this synthetic protocol,
pyruvic acid is converted to pyruvic-d3 acid by exchange with D2O followed by its conversion
to the sodium salt 1 and subsequent recrystallization.
The use of a mild base, e.g., sodium bicarbonate, is essential, because
stronger bases, e.g., NaOH, cause pyruvate to polymerize (Supporting Information (SI), Figure S7).

While the Hirschbein
procedure28 is
the best PEP preparation protocol to date, it requires pyruvic acid
as the starting material. Therefore, it cannot be directly applied
to sodium pyruvate. Our attempt to use the previously reported Dotson
procedure31 resulted in relatively low
yields with variable reproducibility. Here, a new PEP synthesis using
sodium pyruvate is reported representing the combination of modified
Hirschbein and Dotson protocols, Figure 2b.
Optimization of all steps in Figures 2a and 2b allowed one to prepare the main synthetic target
1-13C-PEP-d2 shown in Figure 2c. To summarize, deuteration of 1-13C-pyruvic
acid resulted in sodium 1-13C-pyruvate-d34 with 75% yield and ∼80% isotopic
purity. It was converted to 1-13C-bromopyruvic-d2 acid 5, which was reacted with
P(OMe)3 to form the desired 1-13C-PEP-d26 with 43% yield over
two steps and ∼87% deuterium isotopic
purity. This procedure is efficient, because it allows for a high
percent deuterium isotopic labeling and high yields
of the new isotopomer.

The preliminary PHIP studies with nondeuterated
and deuterated
1-13C-PEP were conducted using previously described setup
and sample preparation18 in 47.5 mT PHIP
polarizer,32 where the hydrogenation high-pressure
reactor was maintained at 35 °C. The pilot experiments were conducted
with PHIP precursor concentration ∼6 mM, [Rh(I) catalyst] ∼2.5
mM at pH ∼12, and in 99.8% D2O. The effective 13C polarization %P was 1.86 ± 0.55%
for 1-13C-PLAC-d2 and %P was 0.13 ± 0.015% for 1-13C-PLAC. The
effective %P was low primarily because of an incomplete
hydrogenation (data not shown) due to slow hydrogenation reaction.
However, the ratio %P(1-13C-PLAC-d2)/%P(1-13C-PLAC)
was 14.3 ± 4.5, representing a significant improvement due to
deuteration of PHIP precursor. 13C T1 increased from 36 ± 2 s (PLAC) to 58 ± 4 s (1-13C-PLAC-d2).

The previously
described PHIP polarizer design utilized a 47.5
mT permanent magnet with a relatively narrow bore of 89 mm, which
cannot be heated above 50 °C. Kadlecek and co-workers33 demonstrated that the PHIP hydrogenation reaction
with similar Rh(I) catalyst and precursors can be significantly accelerated
by a reaction temperature increase. Therefore, further studies with
high PHIP precursor concentration were conducted using a variable
temperature electromagnet PHIP setup operating at 5.75 mT and utilizing
the identical chemical reactor. All samples at both polarizing fields
were hydrogenated using ultrahigh purity H2 (∼7
atm partial pressure using normal H2 gas, i.e., 75% ortho-/25%
para-, or higher percent para-enrichment) for ∼5 s in a 60
mL volume reactor.

The 5.75 mT PHIP polarizer setup enabled
experiments at medium
(55 °C) and high (68 °C) reaction temperatures for ∼5
s-long reaction with ∼7 atm of normal H2 gas pressure,
Figure 3. pH dependence of PEP to PLAC conversion
via molecular hydrogenation was evaluated next (Figure 3a). Figure 3b,c shows the percent conversion
of 5 and 30 mM PEP, respectively, as measured using high-resolution
proton NMR spectroscopy. Briefly, D2O solution of PEP (5
mM) in phosphate buffer (25 mM) was prepared and divided into 25 mL
fractions, which were adjusted to seven pH values: 3.9, 5.95, 7.14,
8.07, 9.93, 11.12, and 12.11. An equimolar solution of PEP and Rh
(I) catalyst (5.3 mM) was prepared by a previously described procedure
from each fraction.34 The solutions collected
from the polarizer outputs were analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy
using PEP/PLAC vinyl/methyl proton intensities’ ratio. Percent
conversion (Figure 3b) was calculated as an
average of two injections at each pH. A high level (>80%) of hydrogenation
was observed in all cases except at pH 12 and above.

PLAC conversion using automated PHIP polarizer.
(b) pH optimization of PEP (5 mM) in phosphate buffer (25 mM) using

of PEP (30 mM) in phosphate buffer (30 mM) using Rh(I) catalyst (5.3
mM) in the pH range of interest. Rh(I) catalyst performs several hydrogenation
cycles using 30 mM PEP, Figure 1. The reaction
temperatures were 68 ± 1 °C (red trace) and 55 ± 1
°C (blue trace). (d) Final pH (of solutions exiting PHIP polarizer)
as a function of the starting pH (solutions entering PHIP polarizer)
of solutions used in (c). All hydrogenations were performed at ∼7
atm of H2 gas partial pressure during an ∼5 s reaction
time.

While hydrogenation of low concentrated
PEP (5 mM) can be useful
for in vitro applications, significantly higher concentration
of an injectable, aqueous, HP contrast agent is typically required
for in vivo imaging.14,16,23,35 Moreover, previous
studies with 1-13C-succinates12,13 indicated that 13C compounds with exchangeable carboxyl
protons near pH ∼5–6 may lose polarization rapidly at
neutral pH due to significantly shortened T1. Therefore, PEP (30 mM) molecular hydrogenation with phosphate buffer
(30 mM) was evaluated in the upper-middle pH range (10.0, 10.5, 11.0,
and 11.5), away from neutral pH. [PEP]/[Rh(I)] ratio was >5.5:1.
Polarizer
output solutions were analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy.
The intensity ratio of PEP vinyl protons and PLAC proton adjacent
to the phosphate group of (CH3CH(OPO3HK)CO2H) yielded % conversion (an average
of 2 injections per each pH value, Figure 3c) ranging from 41% to 74%. Higher reaction temperature translated
into a 3–6% increase of conversion %. Note that the hydrogenation
reaction may continue after exiting PHIP polarizer, but at a significantly
lower rate, because the ejected solution temperature returned to ∼25
°C and H2 pressure ≪1 atm.

The initial
PEP and produced PLAC have different pKa values, and hydrogenation also modifies the Rh(I) catalyst
by removing NBD from its complex. As a result, pH of solutions passing
through PHIP polarizer changes. Figure 3d clearly
demonstrates the observed 1.4 ± 0.3 pH shift between starting
solution (i.e., entering PHIP polarizer) and final solution (i.e.,
exiting PHIP polarizer). This effect must be considered since neutral
pH, e.g., 7.0–7.5, is required for the in vivo injection of HP contrast agents, and pH of solutions exiting PHIP
polarizer, e.g., pH 8.5–10.5, must be adjusted to the neutral
pH range.

The above evaluation of PEP hydrogenation was used
in HP studies
of the fully labeled 1-13C-PEP-d2 precursor 6 (Figure 4a), and
∼26 mM solution of 1-13C-PEP-d26 ([PEP]/[Rh(I)] > 6.5:1) with 30 mM of phosphate
buffer in D2O was prepared at pH = 10.3. Molecular addition
of parahydrogen was performed using ultrahigh purity H2 with >90% para-state.36 After polarization
transfer to 13C, Figure 1, PHIP
product 1-13C-PLAC-d28″ was detected in situ of the polarizer
by single-scan 13C NMR spectroscopy, Figure 4b, with a similar RF probe body as previously reported.32,37 The enhancement factor and %P were calculated as
before32 yielding P =
15.6 ± 3.0% corresponding to the 13C signal and polarization
enhancement factor ε = (3.1 ± 0.6) × 107 when compared to 13C thermal nuclear spin polarization
of only 5.0 × 10–7 % at 5.75 mT and 289 K with in situ T1 (5.75 mT) = 51 ± 2 s (SI), which would be impractical to detect at
such a low field without a hyperpolarization procedure; it would take
an estimated >1 billion years to record the same signal from this
sample without sensitivity enhancement.

∼3 mL and ∼12 μmoles of unreacted 1-13C-PEP-d2 corresponding to ∼82%

PHIP polarizer using 7 atm of parahydrogen and ∼92 °C.

(d) T1 decay of 13C hyperpolarization
of HP 1-13C-PLAC-d2.

Percent conversion of 1-13C-PEP-d2 to HP 1-13C-PLAC-d2 determined by 13C NMR of solutions
ejected from the PHIP
polarizer immediately after in situ NMR detection
(SI, Table S1) was ∼82% (Figure 4b), and it was used to calculate the effective HP
1-13C-PLAC-d2 concentration
used for calculation of % 13C hyperpolarization P and ε above (SI). Importantly, in situ NMR detection required several extra seconds. As
a result, the apparent % conversion (measured by high-resolution NMR
spectroscopy using samples ejected from PHIP polarizer) was affected
by this additional reaction time, leading to an overestimate of %
conversion and an underestimate of % P and ε.
Therefore, the reported values of 13C P = 15.6 ± 3.0% and ε = (3.1 ± 0.6) × 107 represent the lower limit of the achieved 13C
hyperpolarization. Consequently, the actual polarization level may
be significantly higher, but the conversion yield is lower. Improving
% conversion of PEP to PLAC and approaching ∼100% conversion
is feasible similarly to PHIP of succinate13 by further increasing the reaction temperature or parahydrogen partial
pressure.

Conclusion
Deuterium labeling of PHIP precursor, Figures 1 and 2, significantly improved 13C PLAC hyperpolarization. PHIP conducted under identical
conditions demonstrated the polarization increase by 14.3 ± 4.5-fold,
as well as the T1 increase from 36 ±
2 s to 58 ± 2 s at 47.5 mT. This effect of PHIP precursor deuteration
was systematically quantified for the first time. Furthermore, acceleration
of hydrogenation reaction by performing PHIP at elevated temperatures
enabled preparation of highly concentrated and highly 13C polarized 1-13C-PLAC-d2,
e.g., >15.6% of 52 μmoles in 3 mL. This represents ∼100-fold
increase in the payload of produced 13C magnetization per
unit volume, when compared to previously reported 1% polarization
of 7 μmoles in 3 mL for 1-13C-PLAC. These improvements
make 13C HP 1-13C-PLAC-d2 suitable for in vivo applications. The synthetic
methodology presented here allows for large-scale (tens of grams)
production of 1-13C-PEP-d2,
which produces highly polarized 1-13C-PLAC-d2 via PHIP. The produced 13C hyperpolarization
enables >7 orders of sensitivity enhancements of 13C
NMR
signal and nuclear spin polarization. As an example, a small quantity
of analyte (52 μmoles) was detected in a large volume (60 mL)
reactor with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR ∼ 200) using direct 13C detection at 5.75 mT.
