Effective quantification and in situ
identification of circulating
tumor cells (CTCs) in blood are still elusive because of the extreme
rarity and heterogeneity of the cells. In our previous studies, we
developed a novel platform that captures tumor cells at significantly
improved efficiency in vitro using a unique biomimetic
combination of two physiological processes: E-selectin-induced cell
rolling and poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer-mediated strong multivalent
binding. Herein, we have engineered a novel multifunctional surface,
on the basis of the biomimetic cell capture, through optimized incorporation
of multiple antibodies directed to cancer cell-specific surface markers,
such as epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), human epidermal
growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2), and prostate specific antigen (PSA).
The surfaces were tested using a series of tumor cells, MDA-PCa-2b,
MCF-7, and MDA-MB-361, both in mixture in vitro and
after being spiked into human blood. Our multifunctional surface demonstrated
highly efficient capture of tumor cells in human blood, achieving
up to 82% capture efficiency (∼10-fold enhancement than a surface
with the antibodies alone) and up to 90% purity. Furthermore, the
multipatterned antibodies allowed differential capturing of the tumor
cells. These results support that our multifunctional surface has
great potential as an effective platform that accommodates virtually
any antibodies, which will likely lead to clinically significant,
differential detection of CTCs that are rare and highly heterogeneous.

==== Body
The detection
and enumeration
of CTCs in blood have been reported to correlate with cancer progression
and patient survival,1 providing an effective
tool for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer metastasis.2−5 Despite the recent vigorous research efforts and progress in this
field, the sensitive and selective detection of CTCs with clinically
sufficient purity still remains a technical challenge because of the
rarity of CTCs in blood (one CTC in the background of 106–109 hematologic cells).6,7 One
of the most commonly used methods for CTC detection is to differentiate
the tumor cells using their surface markers that are not expressed
by normal hematologic cells.8−10 These surface markers include
EpCAM,11 HER-2,12,14 PSA,13 epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR),15 and carcinoembryonic antigen
(CEA).16

However, the detection
and enrichment of CTCs based on a single
cancer cell marker, most commonly EpCAM, often encounter major challenges
because of the phenotypic heterogeneity among CTCs4 and their biological plasticity during the metastatic process,
known as the epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT).17 While most of the currently available detection methods
including the FDA-approved CellSearch target EpCAM, it has been reported
that approximately 20–30% of tumors such as sarcoma and melanoma
express low-to-no EpCAM.18 Furthermore,
because CTCs frequently lose their epithelial nature upon EMT, resulting
in down-regulated EpCAM expression,19 detection
solely based on aEpCAM is insufficient to capture the CTCs.17,19 Capturing using HER-2 also has limitations since HER-2 is overexpressed
by only 20–30% of breast and prostate cancers,12 resulting in vast variations in detection sensitivity.20

Attempts to address these issues include
a few proof-of-concept
studies using antibody cocktails that have demonstrated enhanced capture
efficiencies, compared to a single antibody-based approach. Various
combinations of antibodies have been used, including mixtures of EpCAM/cytokeratin
(CK),21 EpCAM/HER-2/EGFR,5 and EpCAM/c-Met/folate binding receptor/N-Cadherin/CD318/HER-2/Muc-1/EGFR.22 Although the antibody cocktail-based detection
successfully showed enhanced capture efficiencies, it still has limitations,
such as low purity of CTCs (approximately 14%) captured among the
contaminating leukocytes5 and necessity
of postcapture analysis for identification of the captured cells.
Recently, we demonstrated a novel, surface engineering approach to
achieve enhanced detection of tumor cells by employing a unique combination
of two physiological phenomena: cell rolling and multivalent binding.23−25 E-selectin-mediated cell rolling served as an effective way of recruiting
flowing cells to the capture surface, and tumor cell-specific binding
was substantially improved by incorporation of PAMAM dendrimer-mediated
strong multivalent binding (over 1 million fold improvement in dissociation
constant). This configuration resulted in a novel CTC detection surface
which significantly enhanced capture efficiency up to 7-fold when
compared to the surfaces immobilized with aEpCAM alone.24

In this study, we have designed a biomimetic
surface that accommodates
patterned multiple antibodies to capture heterogeneous populations
of tumor cells in a differential manner, in addition to increasing
sensitivity through the biomimetic combination of cell rolling and
multivalent binding, as illustrated in Figure 1. To assess the feasibility of this design, antibodies against three
cancer-specific biomarkers (EpCAM, HER-2, and PSA) were selected and
immobilized in pattern via PAMAM dendrimers on epoxy-functionalized
glass surfaces, followed by addition of E-selectin. After optimization,
the functionalized surfaces with multiple antibodies were validated
using model CTCs, such as prostate cancer (MDA-PCa-2b) and breast
cancer (MDA-MB-361 and MCF-7) cells, in mixture as well as after being
spiked into human blood to demonstrate their clinical translatability.

with multiple antibodies through dendrimers. (a) Multiple antibodies
against cancer cell surface markers were immobilized on a dendrimer-functionalized
slide. (b) The surface was then backfilled with E-selectin, followed
by (c) flow chamber assembly for flow experiments. Chemical reaction

dendrimers were drawn in the bottom panel.

Results and Discussion
Our design rationale was to achieve
tumor cell-specific capture
patterns based on binding preferences of the tumor cells to the three
antibodies (aEpCAM, aHER-2, and aPSA). We first assessed the binding
patterns of the three individual cell lines that were employed as
CTC models, by observing their binding behaviors with each antibody
using a flow chamber. The antibodies and E-selectin were immobilized
on epoxy-functionalized substrates, as reported in our earlier study.23 The protein-immobilized surfaces were characterized
using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Table S1 in Supporting Information) and energy filtered transmission
electron microscopy (TEM)-carbon mapping analysis (Figures S1 and
S2 in Supporting Information). As shown
in Supporting Information, Figure S3, MDA-PCa-2b
cells were bound to all three antibody-surfaces, and MDA-MB-361 cells
were bound to both aHER-2 and aEpCAM. MCF-7 cells were only bound
to the aEpCAM stripes. On E-selectin-immobilized surfaces, all cell
lines in addition to HL-60, a leukocyte model, exhibited stable rolling
at various velocities (0.1–6.5 μm/s) under 0.2 dyn/cm2 of shear stress (Figure S3 in Supporting
Information).

We then hypothesized that the different
binding behaviors of the
tumor cells could be translated into one substrate, which could be
substantially augmented by introduction of cell rolling and multivalent
binding. First, the widths of aEpCAM and E-selectin-immobilized stripes
were optimized at 500 μm and 2 mm, respectively, based on the
measured capture efficiencies of varied dimensions (Figure 1 and Figures S4 and S5 in Supporting
Information). Next, the multivalent binding effect was engineered
into the surface by immobilizing the three antibodies via PAMAM dendrimers.
The nanoscale topography and carbon distribution of the surfaces were
characterized using energy filtered TEM (Figures S1 and S2 in Supporting Information).

The dendrimer-coated
surfaces exhibited significantly enhanced
capture efficiencies in all conditions, as expected based on our previous
study using aEpCAM.24 Figure 2a shows a set of representative data using MDA-PCa-2b cells
where significant enhancement was achieved by dendrimer-mediated multivalent
binding. Addition of E-selectin to induce cell rolling further enhanced
surface capture efficiency. As shown in Figure 2a, the micropatterned surface with the three dendrimer-antibody conjugates
and E-selectin (defined as a “multifunctional surface”
throughout this paper) showed the dramatically enhanced capture efficiencies
for MDA-PCa-2b cells by up to ∼60-fold when compared to the
surfaces with the corresponding antibodies. After the rolling cells
were washed off using EGTA-PBS buffer, the clear cell binding patterns
on the multifunctional surface (aEpCAM-coated regions in the images)
was observed at a low magnification without postlabeling or treatment
(Figure 2b). Cell accumulations at the interfaces
between the dendrimer-antibody- and E-selectin-coated regions were
also observed. The quantitative comparison to the capture solely based
on individual antibodies revealed that the multifunctional surfaces
are most effective in capture efficiency across all CTC model cells
tested, achieving up to 150-fold enhancement (Figure 2b) at up to 81% capture efficiency (Figure 2d). Cell rolling (the left-hand side of the images) and stationary
binding (the right-hand side of the images) of the cells at the interface
of E-selectin and antibodies, respectively, were observed on the multifunctional
surfaces under flow (direction from left to right) as shown in Supporting Information, Figure S6. Being further
supported by Supporting Information, Movie
S1, these data clearly show the capture mechanism of our multifunctional
surfaces, that is, cell recruitment to the surface via E-selectin
and subsequent specific cell capture on the dendrimer-antibody-stripes,
resulting in the substantially enhanced detection sensitivity.

Figure 2 Enhanced capture
efficiencies of the multifunctional surfaces by
the combined effect of cell rolling and multivalent binding. (a) Fold
enhancement in capture efficiency of the surface functionalized with
the three antibodies, measured using MDA-PCa-2b cells. The surface
with E-selectin and G7 PAMAM dendrimers shows substantially enhanced
capture efficiencies up to 60-fold, compared to the surface with antibodies
only. (b) Bright field microscopic images of the captured MDA-PCa-2b,
MDA-MB-361, and MCF-7 cells on the surfaces functionalized with aEpCAM.
The numbers of the captured cells clearly increase with addition of
the dendrimers and E-selectin without an increase of nonspecific capture
(Scale bar = 200 μm). (c) Fold increase in capture efficiencies
of the surfaces with the three antibodies, G7 PAMAM dendrimers, and
E-selectin, compared to the surfaces functionalized with the antibodies
alone. The three cancer cell lines, depending on their surface marker
expressions, all demonstrate enhanced capture efficiencies on the
multifunctional surfaces, as high as 150 fold. (d) Quantitative capture
efficiencies of each of the antibodies on the multifunctional surface
toward various cancer cells. Although there is a degree of variations,
the surface marker-dependent capturing achieves up to 81% capture
efficiency. *No fold enhancements because of negligible binding without
E-selectin. The Error bars: standard error (n = 4).

The capture mechanism through
sequential rolling and stationary,
multivalent binding allows the multifunctional surfaces to differentiate
“live” cells from their mixtures according to their
surface markers. To identify each cell line in the mixture throughout
the analytical process, the individual cell lines were labeled with
cell-permanent dyes that are used for cell viability assays: MDA-PCa-2b
with Calcein AM (green), MDA-MB-361 with Cell Alive Blue dye (blue),
and MCF-7 with Cell Alive Red dye (red). The schematic diagram of
the differential capture of the cells on the patterned surface is
shown in Figure 3a, and the quantitative measurements
are summarized in Figure 3c. For example, MDA-PCa-2b
cells, the only PSA-positive cell line among the three CTC models,
bound primarily on aPSA-stripe at 91–100% purity from the cell
mixtures with PSA-negative cells. All of the captured cancer cells
using the multifunctional surfaces were fluorescent, indicating that
the bound cells were still alive (Figure 3b).
It was confirmed that the combination of cell rolling and multivalent
binding enhanced the capture efficiency over all three CTC models
in vitro (up to 82%, Figure 3c). Interestingly,
MCF-7 cells showed noticeable binding to the aHER-2-coated surface
after addition of E-selectin (Figure S6c in Supporting
Information), which was not observed on the same surface without
E-selectin (Figures S3c and S7 in Supporting Information). This suggests that the enhanced recruitment of the cells to the
capture surface via E-selectin helps improve the capture efficiency
of the antibodies even though the cells express a low level of the
corresponding surface receptors.

Figure 3 Antibody-dependent surface capture of
tumor cells with enhanced
capture efficiencies. (a) Schematic illustration of the surface marker-dependent
cell capture using aPSA, aHER-2, and aEpCAM. The dotted, faded circle
of MCF-7 cells for aHER-2 indicates the lower capture efficiency due
to low HER-2 expression of MCF-7 cells. (b) The capture patterns of
the three cell lines, visualized in color using fluorescently labeled
cells: Calcein AM (green) for MDA-PCa-2b, Alive cell tracker Blue
(blue) for MDA-MB-361, and Alive cell tracker Red (red) for MCF-7
(Scale bar = 100 μm). (c) Enhanced capture efficiencies of the
cell lines on the three antibody-coated domains by the combined effect
of cell rolling and multivalent binding (up to 82%). Error bars: standard
error (n = 4).

The capture efficiency of the multifunctional surfaces was
then
finally validated using cancer cell-spiked human blood. To measure
the tumor cell binding in clinically relevant conditions, the tumor
cells were spiked into human blood withdrawn from healthy donors,
which represents approximately 1 tumor cell mixed with 10 thousand
leukocytes and 10 million red blood cells per 1 mm3. Mononuclear
cells including tumor cells in a buffy coat were separated from whole
blood using density gradient centrifugation for subsequent analysis.
The hematological cells and fluorescence-labeled cancer cells in a
buffy coat exhibited the rolling responses on the E-selectin stripes
(Movies S3 and S4 in Supporting Information). The rolling leukocytes (impurity) were efficiently removed by
washing with EGTA-supplemented buffer, resulting in separation of
a highly pure population of the captured tumor cells (50–90%
purity of tumor cells captured among the contaminating leukocytes,
Figure 4a). Note that the typical purity reported
in the literatures is only between 0.1 and 14%.5,26,27 The cancer cells from the blood samples
were effectively captured as they maintained the surface marker-dependent
binding, similar to the in vitro results (Figure 4b and Supporting Information, Figure
S9). All the capture efficiencies in the blood samples were substantially
enhanced by up to 12 folds, which is attributed to the combination
effect of the two biomimetic approaches, compared to those of antibody-stripes
without E-selectin and dendrimers (Figure 4b and Supporting Information, Figure S9).

Figure 4 Validation
of the multifunctional surfaces using cancer cell-spiked
blood specimens. (a) A set of representative images of the captured
tumor cells from blood samples on the multifunctional stripes with
aEpCAM. Note the left blood cells (nonfluorescence cells) on the multifunctional
surface were between 10% and 50%, which indicated that the purity
of the captured cancer cells is between 50% and 90% (scale bar = 100
μm). (b) Detection sensitivity of the multifunctional surfaces
was significantly higher, by up to 20-fold, than that of the surfaces
with only antibody stripes. The surface marker-dependent bindings
of cancer cell models were also observed. Error bars: standard error
(n = 4).

As shown in the results presented herein, surface micropatterning
with E-selectin and multiple antibodies demonstrates great potentials
to effectively enrich tumor cells in cell mixtures and in blood samples.
The fast association and dissociation kinetics between E-selectin
and its ligands on cells can facilitate the recruitment of the cancer
cell-containing cell population during flow across the micropatterned
surface (Movie S3 in Supporting Information).23,28 The cell recruitment and subsequent rolling
along E-selectin harness the selective accumulation of cancer cells
on the adjacent antibody-coated stripes (Supporting
Information Figure S6). As a result, MCF-7 cells, despite their
relatively low expression of HER-2,29 exhibited
stable binding to aHER-2 when the surface sensitivity was augmented
by addition of E-selectin (Figure 3c and Supporting Information, Figure S6c). This clearly
displays the benefit of E-selectin-induced rolling for cell recruitment.
After rolling on E-selectin, the densely immobilized antibodies through
dendrimers can exploit multivalent binding effect,24 which allows significantly increased strength of surface
binding with cells and thereby enhanced detection sensitivity using
blood samples (over 10-fold enhancement than the surface with individual
antibodies at up to 82% capture efficiency, Figure 4).

Our results indicate that the combination of cell
rolling and multivalent
binding, along with incorporation of the multiple antibodies, is critical
to enhance the detection specificity and in situ CTC identification.
One can argue that E-selectin decreases specificity by increasing
the number of the bound cells that are not targeted, e.g. binding
of other PSA-negative cells such as MCF-7 cells (Figure 3c) and leukocytes (Figure 4a)30 on the aPSA stripes. However, we have shown
that nonspecifically bound cells on E-selectin can be easily removed
using EGTA-supplemented PBS buffer because the interaction between
E-selectin and cells is Ca2+-dependent (Movie S2 in Supporting Information).25 In addition, the ultralow dissociation constants achieved through
dendrimer-mediated multivalent binding allow the specifically bound
cells to withstand the harsh washing step that may be needed to further
increase purity of the capture cells.24 Compared to other detection methods that typically achieve the purity
of the collected CTCs in the range of 1–20%,8 the high purity (50–90%, Figure 4) of the captured cells from blood samples on our biomimetic
surfaces clearly shows the enhanced detection specificity of this
biomimetic system. This also enables identification at low magnification
without postlabeling by reading the capture patterns of the bound
cells (Figure 2b). It is noteworthy that a
significant progress has been recently made in the CTC capture devices
using various approaches such as those based on graphene/gold patterns
and silicone nanostructures coated with polymers in an integrated
manner.31−36 Liu et al. reported a microfluidic system that integrated an aEpCAM-immobilized
substrate and nonlaminar flow induced by incorporated microstructures,
achieving approximately 90% capture efficiency and over 50% capture
purity from breast cancer cell-spiked human blood.35 Another example is a polymer nanofiber-embedded device
developed by the Tseng group where high capture efficiency (75%) at
a highly purity (without quantitative values reported) of prostate
cancer cells in the presence of human blood was demonstrated.36 However, it is technically difficult to conduct
fair comparison of those devices to ours because the capture efficiency
can substantially vary depending on the experimental conditions, such
as flow rate, tumor cell concentrations, and types of capturing agents
(antibody, peptide, or aptamer). Nonetheless, our system is unique
in that it utilizes the biomimetic combination of cell rolling and
multivalent binding, achieving high capture efficiency and specificity
from both cell suspensions and human blood.

The versatile, multifunctional
platform for tumor cell detection
has potential advantages. The results shown here can be easily expanded
to incorporate a variety of surface markers, such as CD24/44, CD146,
CEA, and others as needed via simple chemical conjugation reactions.
The E-selectin-based approach also allows to capture cells using those
surface markers with low-level expression, which is particularly important,
given that many tumor cells undergo phenotypic changes in terms of
surface marker expression upon EMT and yet such metastatic/post-EMT
cells still highly express E-selectin ligands.37,38 Another advantage includes that cell screening based on multiple
cancer cell markers could provide additional pathological information
on cancer progress. The expression of specific cancer markers in an
early phase could be used as an indicator of later-stage expression
of other markers. For example, HER-2 expression confers androgen-independent
growth to prostate cancer cells in vitro through the activation of
the androgen receptor in a ligand-independent way.39 The HER-2-activated androgen receptor could affect the
transcription of its downstream target, PSA, and eventually promote
the prostate cancer progress.39 Therefore,
simultaneous screening of HER-2 and PSA using this highly sensitive
multifunctional surface presented in this study could be potentially
used to monitor the progress of prostate cancer. Furthermore, the
pathological information on an individual cancer patient obtained
using the multifunctional surfaces could be also used as an indicator
for his/her drug responsiveness to the personalized treatment (e.g.,
cancer immunotherapy), which can provide clinically valuable information
to further enhance the therapeutic efficiency. This clinical validation
of our multifunctional CTC capture platform is the subject of our
future clinical studies.

Taken together, this study demonstrates
that our biomimetic, multifunctional
surface shows substantially enhanced capture efficiency of the tumor
cells at high purity, both in culture media and human blood, compared
to the surfaces coated with antibodies only. Versatility and modularity
of this surface platform allow expansion to multiple antibodies, resulting
in the enhanced sensitivity (up to 82% capture efficiency) and specificity
(up to 90% capture purity) of cell capture. Additionally, we have
shown that the surface micropatterning can be applicable to differentiate
the captured cancer cells and their cell surface markers in situ.
This multiple antibody-immobilized dendrimer platform along with high
detection sensitivity and specificity paves the way for potential
use of this system as a diagnostic and prognostic tool for monitoring
cancer progress and responses to therapies of metastatic cancer patients.

Methods
Materials
Antihuman epithelial-cell-adhesion-molecule
(EpCAM)/TROP1 antibody (aEpCAM), antihuman epidermal growth factor
receptor-2 (HER-2)/TROP1 antibody (aHER-2), antihuman prostate specific
antigen (PSA)/TROP1 antibody (aPSA), and recombinant human E-selectin
(E-selectin) were all purchased from R&D systems (Minneapolis,
MN). Epoxy-functionalized glass surfaces (SuperEpoxy2) were purchased
from TeleChem International, Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA). PAMAM dendrimers
(generation 7), bovine serum albumin (BSA), Calcein AM, and all other
chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and used
without further purification unless otherwise specified.

Surface Functionalization
by Immobilization of Adhesive Proteins
A polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) gasket with well-defined micropatterning
was used to define the area of an epoxy functionalized glass slide,
as depicted in Figure 1. Surface immobilization
of Generation 7 (G7) PAMAM dendrimer and subsequent conjugation with
antibodies were performed, as previously reported.24 For antibody conjugation, antibody solutions of aEpCAM
(5 μg/mL), aHER-2 (5 μg/mL) and aPSA (10 μg/mL)
in PBS were used. The micropatterned antibodies were treated with
FITC-conjugated BSA (1 mg/mL in PBS buffer) for 1 h to define the
dendrimer-antibody-coated regions. After the PDMS gasket was removed,
the surface with the antibody stripes was incubated with 0.2 mL of
E-selectin at a concentration of 5 μg/mL in PBS for 4 h. The
volumes of all reagent solutions except E-selectin were fixed at 20
μL. All incubation processes were carried at room temperature
with constant gentle shaking, and between all preparation steps, the
surfaces were washed with DDI water and PBS three times to remove
the residual chemicals from the surfaces. Potential nonspecific binding
of both protein-coated and uncoated regions was blocked by a final
incubation with 1% (w/v) BSA or 1 μg/mL methoxy PEG-NH2 (Nektar Therapeutics, Huntsville, AL) solution. The functionalized
surfaces were kept at 4 °C, and the experiments using the surfaces
were performed within 24 h after the surface preparation.

Fluorescence
Labeling for Viable Cells
Cells at a concentration
of 1 × 106 cells/mL (5 mL) were seeded onto a 25 cm2 T flask 1 day before the experiment. To label the viable
cells with fluorescence, the MDA-PCa-2b, MDA-MB-361, and MCF-7 cells
were treated with 4 μM Calcein AM, 5 μM Alive cell track
It Blue (AAT Bioquest, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), and 5 μM Alive
cell track It Red (AAT Bioquest, Inc.), respectively, at 37 °C
in dark for 30 min. The labeled cells were trypsinized to make their
suspensions at a predetermined concentration in FBS-supplemented cell
culture media or whole blood withdrawn from healthy donors. The prepared
cell suspensions were kept on ice throughout the subsequent experiments.

Blood preparation using Ficoll-Paque Plus
The heparin-treated
blood was kept at 4 °C in a refrigerator and the experiments
were performed within 48 h after drawing. Fluorescence-labeled cancer
cells were spiked to 3 mL of whole blood as a final concentration
of 1 × 105 tumor cells/mL blood. Mononuclear cells
including tumor cells in buffy coat was separated from whole blood
using Ficoll-Paque Plus (Stemcell Technologies Inc., Vancouver, Canada)
as described in section 7 of Supporting Information. Briefly, the blood samples loaded with Ficoll for separation were
centrifuged at 20 °C for 20 min at 1,500× g with brake function
off. After the buffy coat was washed twice with the FBS/heparin-included
PBS buffer via centrifuge, the recovered cells were suspended with
3 mL of the complete cell culture media and used for subsequent experiments.
Studies using human blood were reviewed and approved by UIC institutional
review board (IRB) (protocol 2012-0139).

Observation of Cellular
Responses Using Flow Chamber
A typical flow chamber experiment
was performed as we reported earlier.23 Suspensions of HL-60 and fluorescence-labeled
cancer cells (MDA-PCa-2b, MDA-MB-361, MCF-7) were injected into a
rectangular flow chamber with a gasket (30 mm (L)
× 10 mm (W) × 0.15 mm (D), Glycotech, Gaithersburg, MD) using a syringe pump (New Era pump
Systems Inc., Farmingdale, NY). The number of captured cells on each
of the antibody-immobilized stripes defined using FITC-BSA was counted
using the images taken after one cycle, consisting of forward flow
(pushing) for 5 min and backward flow (withdrawing) for 5 min at 50
μL/min (0.2 dyn/cm2). The surface was washed using
PBS for 10 min at 200 μL/min (0.9 dyn/cm2). To remove
the leukocyte cells from the E-selectin-regions, the surface was washed
using EGTA/Mg2+ in PBS buffer for 3 min at 200 μL/min
(0.9 dyn/cm2).25 On the basis
of the known number of cancer cells perfused into the flow chamber,
the numbers of captured cells per antibody-stripe were calculated
and converted into capture efficiency (%). All cells on the surface
were monitored using an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope (IX 70-S1F2,
Olympus America, Inc., Center Valley, PA) with fluorescence light,
and images were recorded using a 10× objective and a CCD camera
(QImaging Retiga 1300B, Olympus America, Inc.). The number of cells
on the surfaces was counted, based on the images taken in independent
observations/measurements using ImageJ (NIH).
