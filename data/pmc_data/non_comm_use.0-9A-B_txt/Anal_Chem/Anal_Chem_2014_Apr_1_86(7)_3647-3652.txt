We report a microfluidic device,
using segmented flow in a two-phase
system of immiscible liquids, which delivers aqueous droplets into
a modified commercial mass spectrometer. The interface coupling the
microfluidics to the mass spectrometer achieves up to 96% sample transfer
efficiency to the vacuum chamber. Sample ionization is assisted by
multipass infrared laser beam in the interface. The system achieves
low femtomole detection limits of several analytes ranging from drugs
to proteins. Sample ionization in this segmented-flow sampling was
found to be remarkably insensitive to the presence of buffer salts
and other matrices.

Introduction
of solutions into
mass spectrometers (MS) has become routine since the advent of electrospray
ionization (ESI).1,2 The homogeneous nature of solutions
and the linear flow regime virtually guarantee a constant delivery
of analytes dissolved in the solvent, which is essential for quantitative
analysis. The concentration dependence of the electrospray ion signal3−5 becomes a limiting factor when the sample is originally confined
to a small volume, such as that of a single cell. For example, dissolving
the content of a single cell, ranging from 10–13 to 10–12 L in volume, in a solvent volume of 1
μL and subsequent introduction into the mass spectrometer by
nanospray ionization results in a 106-fold dilution of
the cell components, e.g., from micromolar to picomolar. Such concentrations
are not only at the limit of detection for methods using electrospraying,
but also handling such highly diluted solutions is prone to contamination
by other exogenous components obscuring or suppressing the analyte
signal. These issues have been recognized for other concentration-dependent
analytical methods, e.g., fluorescence spectroscopy and several approaches
have been developed to overcome the dilution problem.6,7 One approach relies on compartmentalization of the analyte solution
into small volume droplets that are separated by an immiscible liquid
in a channel of a microfluidic device.8−11 Reducing the droplet volume reduces
the dilution factor for the contents of a single cell and potentially
results in concentrations that are more readily handled by ESI-MS
or spectroscopic methods.12,13 Droplet-based fluidics
has been used in several approaches that used continuous14−16 or discontinuous17−21 sampling of single droplets into the mass spectrometer.

Here,
we report a new system for coupling microfluidics to a simple
mass spectrometer that achieves efficient sample delivery from compartmentalized
aqueous droplets. Droplet microfluidics offer tools for manipulation
of small volumes that are difficult to achieve by other means, while
modern mass spectrometry provides superior detection capabilities.
So far, the combination of both methods has been limited due to challenges
in sample ionization because, under normal operating conditions, the
immiscible biphase composition of a liquid stream is poorly compatible
with electrospray.17−21 We report a new method that overcomes these limitations and achieves
attomole limits of detection per a single compartment while demonstrating
substantial robustness toward buffers, blood plasma, and other difficult
matrixes.

Experimental Section
Microfluidics
Aqueous droplets (plugs)
were generated
by a microfluidic T-junction (IDEX Corporation) using fluorinated
oil (perfluorohexane, Aldrich, Madison, WI) as the continuous phase
(micrographs of the plugs can be found in the Supporting Information, Figure S1). The phase materials were
injected into the channels using syringe pumps (KDS100, KD Scientific
Holliston, MA). The mass spectrometer interface is compatible with
any microfluidics channel or device that can be terminated by a capillary
outlet. For the presented proof of principle experiments, the T-junction
droplet generator was used as it allows nanoliter droplets to be produced
at relatively low frequencies (∼10 Hz). The capillaries used
to build the microfluidics channel were standard coated fused silica
50/360 μm (i.d./o.d.) (Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ).
Perfluorohexane was selected as the immiscible phase of choice after
a thorough study of different available liquids mainly because of
its low boiling point and commercial availability.

Mass Spectrometer
A commercially available orthogonal
reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Waters, Manchester, U.K.)
was stripped of the standard Z-spray ion source and further modified
to allow droplet sampling. In its original configuration, the LCT
Premier consists of six differentially pumped regions, two of which
were removed and replaced by the single manifold that allows transport
of droplets into the vacuum and the subsequent evaporation and ionization
of the droplets aqueous components. This manifold contains the interface
described below.

Interface
A glass-lined stainless
steel capillary (1.5
mm i.d., length 300 mm) was used to transfer the droplets from atmospheric
pressure into the first vacuum region, evacuated by a roots blower
(140 L/s; WAU 501, Leybold) to a pressure of ∼1.5 Torr. The
glass-lined stainless steel inlet capillary was kept at a high potential
(500 V) and aligned with the main axis of the ion optics. A gold plated
tube lens (Epner Technologies, New York) was used inside the first
vacuum region and also kept at a high potential of 400–500
V. The droplets were transported through this tube lens, which acts
both as an electrostatic lens for freshly generated ions as well as
a multireflection mirror for an IR-laser (25 W CO2 laser,
Synrad, Bothell, WA, model 48-2, 2ω = 10.6 μm, d = 3.5 mm) used for droplet evaporation. The laser is guided
into the first vacuum region through a ZnSe vacuum port and finally
reflected by a mirror (both (Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) into the gold coated
tube lens. The remaining power of the laser beam is dissipated into
a block of anodized aluminum which was also mounted inside the vacuum
manifold.

Cells and Lysate
Human breast cancer cells (MCF-7)
were cultured in EMEM (Eagles Minimum Essential Media) growth media
(American Type Culture Collection) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were rinsed 3 times via
centrifugation and resuspension in DI water. The solution was then
diluted to obtain a final concentration of 1.2 × 106 cells/mL.

Software
The instrument control
and data collection
was performed using MassLynx 4.0 software (Waters). The spectra were
then exported to Mmass 5.4 (www.mmass.org) for further
processing. The Lipid maps database search at Lipidomics gateway (National
Institute of General Medical Sciences) was performed using the embedded
Mmass function.

Results and Discussion
General Mode of Operation
The new interface (Figure 1A) has a large
inlet opening (1.5 mm) for efficient
droplet introduction into the vacuum system and an ion transfer device,
combining an electrostatic tube lens element with an infrared mirror.
This combination allows for IR laser-assisted droplet evaporation
in the rough vacuum region of the mass spectrometer and formation
of gas-phase ions. Continuous streams of separated immiscible liquid
phase compartments (water and fluorinated oil, Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) are generated in a microfluidic
device which was realized as a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chip,22 or a fused silica capillary T-junction. The
stream is converted to droplets and flown into the vacuum system.
The droplets are evaporated by multipass laser beam in an IR-reflective
electrostatic tube (Figure S2 in the Supporting
Information), the content of the aqueous compartments is ionized,
and the ions are transferred to the high-vacuum region and mass analyzed
in a reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The oil phase is
vaporized and pumped out before reaching the mass spectrometer. The
mode of operation is quite simple. Charged droplets23 are generated by applying a medium-high voltage (2–3
kV) at the tip of a fused silica capillary mounted at the exit from
the microfluidic device. The aqueous or methanol droplets created
from the tip are transported through the inlet capillary (1.5 mm i.d.)
with up to 96% efficiency. This was rigorously determined for aqueous
solutions of crystal violet in the following fashion. Droplets emitted
from the tip and transmitted through the inlet capillary were collected
in a small cup container inserted at the vacuum end of the capillary
and the collected content was reanalyzed by a UV–vis assay
to quantify sample recovery. This is analogous to the quantitative
analysis used in soft landing of electrosprayed material.24

vacuum region. (Panel B) Mass spectrum of 38 fmol of verapamil delivered
in a single water compartment separated by immiscible plugs of perfluorohexane.

Droplet Formation and Delivery
Individual aqueous droplets
were ionized and monitored by mass spectrometry in a continuous flow
of a two-phase plug stream. For system testing purposes, the aqueous
plugs were loaded with 10–5 M verapamil that was
monitored at m/z 455 ± 1. The
ion signal generated from aqueous plugs showed substantial stability
over 30–120 s. The plug-to plug ion current variations were
<20% when plotted as the verapamil ion intensity at m/z 455 (Figure S3 in the Supporting
Information). At the typical flow rates, 45 μL/h (12.5
nL/s) and 150 μL/h (41.7 nL/s) for the water-based phase and
perfluorohexane, respectively, the ion signal from a droplet showed
a mean baseline width of 0.3–0.4 s and the peaks of adjacent
droplets were spaced by approximately 0.5 s. Note that the ion signal
drops to background level between two aqueous droplets, indicating
that perfluorohexane does not efficiently ionize under these experimental
conditions and generates negligible background signal in the mass
spectrometer. Moreover, the perfect separation of ion signal from
individual droplets illustrates that there was no mixing of content
from adjacent aqueous plugs due to carryover in the microfluidics
system.

Given the aqueous plug volume (3.8 nL) and verapamil
10–5 M concentration, each plug contained 38 fmol
of verapamil. The scan time of the mass spectrometer was set to 50
ms with 10 ms interscan delay, so that one plug of the verapamil solution
roughly was sampled in five scans or 300 ms of data acquisition. The
full mass spectrum in the m/z 100–1000
range obtained by averaging a single plug over 300 ms is shown in
Figure 1B. This shows the most abundant ion
at m/z 455, which corresponds to
protonated verapamil, and very little background peaks in the mass
spectrum. The spectrum in Figure 1B showed
verapamil intensity of ∼480 counts. By averaging mass spectra
of 10 randomly selected plugs of verapamil–water solution from
the same experiment, we calculated the average intensity value per
plug to be 435 ± 45 counts, indicating a 10% plug-to-plug variation.
The plug-to-plug repeatability mainly depended on the plug generation
in the microfluidic T-junction and transport into the mass spectrometer
at the tip of the fused silica capillary. Considering the background
signal in the spectrum (2 counts), the above-calculated average verapamil
signal for the 38 fmol plug was 73 times above the triple background
level. This indicates that high attomole limits of detection for the
verapamil load in a single plug are possible to achieve with this
device. The estimated detection limits of the segmented-flow droplet
method are higher than those reported previously for extractive electrospray
and tandem mass spectrometric detection of highly ionizable analytes
in an ion trap.25 This is possibly due
to the larger droplet size produced by our method and a lower charge-to-mass
ratio. However, this is compensated by very low matrix effects in
the segmented-flow droplet method, as discussed below.

Large Molecular
Mass Analytes
The new sampling interface
was found to work equally well for biopolymers. Figure 2A shows the spectrum of a single plug that contained 80 fmol
of cytochrome c in water containing 0.5% of formic acid. The inset
in Figure 2A shows the spectrum from a single
plug flipped against the sum of spectra from several plugs illustrating
the reproducibility of the protein charge states formed by droplet
ionization. The most abundant peak corresponds to [M + 10H+]10+ at m/z 1236. The
characteristic multiple charging of the protein analyte indicates
that the ionization mechanism is not fundamentally different from
the standard electrospray mechanism. Note that the spectrum shows
no peak of dissociated heme at m/z 616, indicating that protein transition from the droplet into the
gas phase, as well as the ionization process forming the multiply
charged states, were soft enough to prevent heme dissociation from
the protein ion. Figure 2B shows the spectrum
of a single plug containing 600 fmol of the cyclic peptide gramicidine-S
in water ([MH]+ at m/z 1141). The spectrum is dominated by a doubly charged ion at m/z 571, pointing again to an electrospray-like
ionization.

Figure 2 (Panel A) Mass spectrum obtained by recording the signal of a single
plug containing 80 fmol of cytochrome c in water. The inset shows
a sum of spectra obtained from several plugs, confirming the m/z assignment for individual charge states,
flipped against the single plug spectrum. (Panel B) Mass spectrum
obtained by recording the signal of a single plug containing 600 fmol
of Gramicidin-S in water.

Matrix Effects
The potential for quantitative analysis
of the droplet-MS system often depends on its sensitivity to the presence
of various matrices. This was first tested by detecting verapamil
in a mixture of three analytes (propranolol, verapamil, and reserpine)
that were contained at 10–5 M each in water plugs
separated by perfluorohexane. The spectrum of the mixture showed practically
no verapamil signal suppression due to the presence of the other analytes
(Figure 3A).

Figure 3 (Panel A) Mass spectrum obtained by recording
signal of a single
plug containing propranolol (m/z 260), verapamil (m/z 455), and
reserpine (m/z 609) in water. (Panel
B) Mass spectrum obtained by recording signal of a single plug containing
propranolol (m/z 260), verapamil
(m/z 455), and reserpine (m/z 609; suppressed) in PBS. The inset
shows spectrum detail zoomed on verapamil proton and sodium adducts.
Compared with the spectra in Figures S3 and S4 in the Supporting Information that show much poorer
tolerance of PBS on commercial instruments. (Panel C) Mass spectrum
obtained by recording signal of a single plug containing 20 fmol of
verapamil (MH+m/z 455;
MNa+m/z 477) in porcine
blood plasma. Figure S7 in the Supporting Information shows comparison with the spectra obtained by summing of several
plugs.

In a still more stringent test,
plugs of analytes were generated
from concentrated PBS buffer containing 11.9 mM phosphate, 137 mM
sodium chloride, and 2.7 mM potassium chloride. The mass spectrum
in Figure 3B shows that propranolol and verapamil
ions were formed albeit with ∼4-fold signal suppression compared
to a salt-free solution. The reserpine signal was almost completely
suppressed. Under these high salt loading conditions, verapamil was
the only analyte that also formed a significant sodium ion adduct
at m/z 477 (Figure 3B). Remarkably, even in the presence of the concentrated PBS
buffer, the spectrum showed very low chemical noise due to the salt
ions. This indicates that charged salt clusters were either not formed
during droplet evaporation and subsequent ionization or were not transmitted
from the interface into the instrument. By comparison, when the same
solutions of these three analytes in water and PBS were electrosprayed
on a Bruker LC Esquire ion trap and a Waters Quattro Micro tandem
quadrupole mass spectrometer, the spectra were strongly affected by
PBS, and the reserpine peak at m/z 609 was at the noise level. In addition, the spectra obtained on
both instruments, the Bruker LC Esquire in particular, showed very
high levels of chemical noise due to the PBS buffer (Figure S4 and
S5, Supporting Information). Note that
both these commercial instruments use heated gas at 200—250
°C to assist electrospray nebulization and droplet evaporation.
The segmented-flow droplet method is clearly superior to standard
heated-source electrospray in generating cleaner mass spectra.

Since the new droplet microfluidics interface demonstrated such
a robust behavior toward high salt content, we attempted to analyze
(i) porcine blood plasma mixed with verapamil solution in a 1:1 ratio
to achieve a final concentration of verapamil in plasma at 5 ×
10–6 M and (ii) a cell lysate spiked with verapamil
and propranolol. In the first experiment, EDTA was added to the plasma
and centrifuged at 10 000 rpm immediately before mixing with
the verapamil solution. We were able to obtain mass spectra from plugs
of plasma separated by perfluorohexane. Figure 3C shows a spectrum of a single plasma plug that contained 20 fmol
of verapamil. Interestingly, this spectrum is dominated by a sodium
adduct (m/z 477) whereas, in the
PBS buffer, verapamil was predominantly protonated. The system was
robust enough to perform several measurements, although it did suffer
from occasional capillary clogging. Also, contamination of both the
fluidics channels and inlet capillary was a problem in long-running
experiments with untreated plasma.

In the other experiment,
mammalian cell lysate (see the Supporting Information for the procedure) was
spiked with verapamil and propranolol solutions to the final concentration
of 10–5 M. The original density of harvested cell
suspension was 106 cells per mL, but after lysis the cell
content was diluted so a single 5 nL plug containing ∼1–10
cells. Plugs of this spiked cell lysate were successfully generated
in a two phase flow system with perfluorohexane (Figure S6, Supporting Information), although the separation
and plug-to-plug repeatability were worse than in the case of pure
water or buffer solutions. The mass spectrum of a single plug of spiked
cell lysate is shown in Figure 4A. It shows
the peaks of protonated, sodiated, and potassiated propranolol with
MH+, MNa+, and MK+ at m/z 260, 282, and 299, respectively, and verapamil
with MH+, MNa+, and MK+ at m/z 455, 477, and 493, respectively (for
a detailed zoom, see Figure 4B). The spectrum
also showed peaks representing the content of approximately 10 lysed
cells in two distinct mass regions. The first region consisted of
several peaks between m/z 650 and
950 (inset in Figure 4B) that can be attributed
to known glycerophosphopeptides. The lower mass region of m/z 200–500 showed peaks that matched m/z of several fatty acids (Figure 4B). The assignments were made from a search in the
Lipidmaps database at the Lipidomics gateway. The results of the search
are given in (Figure S8 and Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information). It should be noted that the search
was performed with a 20 ppm mass accuracy limit and the results that
are based only on m/z data must
be viewed as a proof-of-the-principle concept, rather than a definite
identification.

plug of
lysed cells in water spiked with propranolol and verapamil. Panel
A shows the overall spectrum. Panel B shows a spectrum zoomed on the
lower m/z region of the spectrum
in the main figure, while the inset shows a zoom on the glycerophospolipid
region of the spectrum.

The above-described device for segmented flow introduces
a dramatically
simple delivery system for the generation of compartmentalized aqueous
droplets. The system can be realized as a PDMS chip22 or assembled from commercially available fused silica capillaries.
A substantial improvement is the use of a volatile water-immiscible
phase that avoids the need for removal of the oil phase from the microfluidics
channel prior the ionization.17−19 The capillary microfluidic system
offers some advantages that facilitated the development of the interface,
e.g., the fact that the individual parts were readily replaceable.
A substantial advantage against microfluidics chips is the much more
tolerant surface properties of fused silica compared to poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS). This allowed us to experiment with a wide range of water-immiscible
phases while avoiding surfactants to modify the surface tension in
the aqueous droplets. The flow rates achieved with the capillary-based
system (12 nL/s) were quite comparable to those used in microfluidic
channels on standard chips.

A very important feature of the
new microfluidic-MS system is its
robustness toward high salt content in buffers and blood plasma. This
is presumably related to rapid droplet evaporation in the IR laser
beam that makes analyte ion desorption into the gas phase less sensitive
to surface effects compared to ionization by electrospray. Another
point worth emphasizing is that the interface can handle a continuous
stream of plugs of water and perfluorinated oil at very low flow rates;
such a solvent system is not efficiently ionized by standard electrospray.
The TOF mass analyzer covers the entire mass range, e.g., m/z 100–1000 shown here, and not
only a few channels as in the selected or multiple reaction monitoring
modes used on tandem quadrupole instruments for ultrasensitive detection.
Thus, our method allows multiple analytes, including unknowns, to
be detected in the mass spectrum, not just those in a priori known
and preselected channels. Further improvements in sensitivity and
detection limits can undoubtedly be implemented by mating the interface
with a mass spectrometer equipped with a more advanced ion optics,
mass analyzer, and multichannel plate ion detector. The new method
complements other approaches to ultrasensitive detection of single-cell
content.26−30

Conclusions
Segmented-flow microfluidics in combination
with a new laser-assisted
ionization interface provides a convenient means of delivering analyte
cargo from aqueous droplets. The immiscible perfluorohexane liquid
phase does not generate background ions in the positive ionization
mode that would interfere with analyte ionization. The droplet method
is remarkably robust toward the presence of buffers, salts, and other
high-level matrix components. On the other hand, the formation of
large (>10 μm) droplets decreases the ionization efficiency
compared to electrospray, which somewhat compensates the high yield
of material delivery from the microfluidic device to the vacuum system
of the mass spectrometer. Further efforts on improving the ion efficiency
to achieve routine single cell analysis are in progress in this laboratory.
