Supervised
modeling of mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data is
a crucial component for the detection of the distinct molecular characteristics
of cancerous tissues. Currently, two types of supervised analyses
are mainly used on MSI data: pixel-wise segmentation of sample images
and whole-sample-based classification. A large number of mass spectra
associated with each MSI sample can represent a challenge for designing
models that simultaneously preserve the overall molecular content
while capturing valuable information contained in the MSI data. Furthermore,
intensity-related batch effects can introduce biases in the statistical
models. Here we introduce a method based on ion colocalization features
that allows the classification of whole tissue specimens using MSI
data, which naturally preserves the spatial information associated
the with the mass spectra and is less sensitive to possible batch
effects. Finally, we propose data visualization strategies for the
inspection of the derived networks, which can be used to assess whether
the correlation differences are related to coexpression/suppression
or disjoint spatial localization patterns and can suggest hypotheses
based on the underlying mechanisms associated with the different classes
of analyzed samples.

==== Body
Mass spectrometric imaging (MSI)
has been widely applied to investigate the spatial distributions of
molecular species within tissue specimens. In particular, it has shown
promising results to serve as a technological platform for the study
of chemical heterogeneity of samples. Particularly, in the case of
cancer tissue, established protocols exist that are tailored to the
imaging analysis of human biopsy specimens (either freshly prepared,
frozen tissue, or formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE), etc.1,2) using either desorption electrospray ionization (DESI),3,4 matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS),5−10 or secondary ionization mass spectrometry (SIMS)11−14 as the predominant MSI analytical
techniques. Applying any of these techniques to a sample generates
a set of ion images that we denote as mass spectrometry (MS) images
or, equivalently, MSI sample in this text.

Two major statistical
modeling approaches are often employed to
identify relationships between ion signatures and sample properties
of interest. Unsupervised methods try to capture the intrinsic statistical
properties of the MSI data, such as spectral similarity, and generate
partitions of the data without relying on any external ground truth.
These methods can be useful to suggest novel hypotheses on the metabolic
pathways associated with cancerous tissue, for instance, when histological
or other expert-driven properties of the analyzed samples are missing.15−20 In contrast, supervised methods aim to determine statistical relationships
between the observed ion signatures and “labels” associated
with the analyzed data, that are manually generated by experts. Two
different types of supervised modeling can be applied to MSI data.
The first approach, called “segmentation” uses the manual
labels associated with pixel spectra to partition the MS images into
regions characterized by the same property of interest.21 For instance, a segmentation method can predict
the labels of MS image pixels, generating a spatial map of regions
associated with tumor, necrotic, or surrounding connective tissue.22−24 The second approach aims to predict the label of an entire MS image
based on the molecular information contained in it. For example, a
model can be trained to discriminate between MS images from healthy
tissue sections and cancerous tissue sections, or between different
types of cancer.

The importance of these types of models is
evident considering
that they allow associating a general property to the entire MSI sample,
with the possibility of determining general molecular patterns that
are responsible for the different classes of analyzed samples.

However, the large number of mass spectra present in a single MSI
sample makes it challenging to design a model that captures a single
property (the “label”) preserving its molecular information.
Currently, the most used approach is based on extracting a “representative”
spectrum for the entire MS image, which is then related to the corresponding
label.25,26 A typical choice is the mean spectrum calculated
over pixels of the same tissue type. Another approach is based on
selecting a random subset of pixel spectra from the tissue of interest
and predicting their class.27

Clearly,
these approaches have limitations. The first approach
fails to preserve the two most important properties of MS images,
their molecular heterogeneity and spatial distributions, compressing
all the data into a single spectrum. The second approach introduces
new challenges in determining the final prediction of the entire MS
image. For instance, if the selected pixels are predicted to belong
to different classes, how is the final prediction (that is related
to the entire MS image) generated?18

Another difficulty associated with all these methods is that they
require the precise annotation of a histologically homogeneous region
from where the pixels are extracted and associated with the global
sample label.

Ultimately, statistical models can be biased by
the presence of
batch effects. These may originate from several (often difficult to
control) sources, such as instrumental conditions (for instance, temperature
fluctuations, drifts in mass/charge ratio calibration) or sample-related
properties (for example, tissue chemical matrix, ion suppression).28 Biased data sets (consisting of multiple MSI
samples) often exhibit systematic variations of the mass spectral
intensities of specific MSI samples, that are not a product of their
inner properties, but a consequence of the specific experimental conditions
during the spectral acquisition.

For this reason, normalization
techniques are necessary to reduce
the spectral intensity variations due to possible batch effects.29

Here we present an alternative approach
for the classification
of entire MSI samples that addresses the two challenges discussed,
preserving more of the rich molecular information and being less sensitive
to the systematic variations of mass spectral intensities induced
by batch effects.

The hypothesis behind the method presented
for classifying tumor
MS images is that the observed spatial patterns of the ion peak intensities
reflect the metabolic properties of the analyzed sample. This hypothesis
is compatible with the typical observation in the supervised segmentation
of MS images, where a set of ions are characterized by a significantly
higher (lower) peak intensity in a specific region of the tissue section.
This is equivalent to saying that these ions are more (less) colocalized
in that area than in the remaining part of the tissue. Additionally,
the central assumption underlying this type of analysis is that the
expression of these ions relates to either one or more metabolic mechanisms
occurring within the local region of the sample.

Here, we apply
the concept of ion colocalization to represent the
entire molecular information on individual tissue samples. In this
way, the whole sample can be expressed in its entirety by a single
vector of colocalization features. Additionally, possible issues caused
by batch-to-batch variability30,31 can be mitigated, since
colocalization is a relative measure and, therefore, is less sensitive
to systematic variations of ion intensities across multiple samples.
A similar concept has been previously employed for unsupervised (in
contrast to supervised in this work) analysis of MSI data (generating
clusters of highly colocalized ions).32−36

Conceptually, the MSI data is converted into
a graph, and then
network features are used for supervised classification, analogously
to Amoroso et al.,37 where the complex
networks framework is employed for classifying patients with neurodegenerative
disease. Specifically, Pearson’s correlation has been used
as a suitable measure for determining the degree of colocalization,
in particular, in fluorescence microscopy.38

In this paper, we show how the colocalization features can
be used
to classify three types of cancer specimens (breast, ovarian, and
colorectal). This approach results in higher predictive performance,
potentially providing a deeper insight into the possible mechanisms
underlying their biochemical differences than the current state-of-the-art
methodologies.

Materials and Methods
Sixty-nine
specimens from three distinct cohorts of human tumors
were cryo-sectioned and subsequently analyzed by DESI-MSI. The full
data set consisted of 28 breast cancers, part of the data set published
in Guenther et al.,26 16 colorectal adenocarcinomas,
part of the data set published in Inglese et al.,36 and 25 ovarian cancer samples, part of the data set published
in Doria et al.39 All the raw spectra were
acquired in the negative ion mode using a custom DESI sprayer ion
source interfaced to a high-resolution orbital trapping mass spectrometer
(Exactive, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the range of 150–1000 m/z using the experimental and instrumental
conditions reported in the Supporting Information, Table S1. For the data analysis, the tissue sections were split
into two random subsets, denoted “cross-validation set”
and “test set”, consisting of 16 tissue sections per
tumor type and 12 breast plus 9 ovarian cancer sections, respectively.

Preprocessing
All the raw spectral data were first
converted into the imzML format (centroided mode),40 and their m/z values
were corrected using a single point recalibration, using a locally
estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) model fitted on the distance
between the observed and the theoretical m/z values of palmitic acid (255.2330 m/z, [M – H]−).36 Observed m/z values corresponded
to the closest peak within a search window of 10 ppm, compatible with
the theoretical instrumental error. The use of LOESS allowed correcting
for the global m/z drift trends
while preserving the small fluctuations.

The recalibrated image
samples were independently preprocessed through a workflow consisting
of (a) total ion count (TIC) scaling intensity normalization, (b)
peak matching, and (c) log-transformation using MALDIquant for R.41,42 The choice of TIC-scaling normalization
followed the fact that we were interested in the colocalization patterns
based on the relative abundance of the spectral peaks. TIC-scaling
also simplified the interpretation of the results, where the normalized
ion intensities could be read as fractions of the total amount of
detected molecules in each pixel. The peak matching procedure assigned
the detected peaks intensity from each pixel of an MS image to a common m/z vector. Each pixel spectrum was allowed
to contribute to a specific common m/z value with only one peak (Supporting Information, Table S2). No inter-sample normalization to reduce possible
inter-samples batch effect was applied.

Tissue-unrelated peaks
were filtered using the global reference
and pixel count filters of the SPUTNIK package for R.43 The parameters used are reported in
the Supporting Information, Table S3.

In order to match the common peaks detected in the MS images, a
similar peak matching procedure was applied to the spectra representative
of the MS images. The average of the nonzero peaks intensity within
each MS image was used as a representative spectrum of each MS image
of the cross-validation set. Only the matched peaks detected in all
the images were retained for the statistical modeling (Supporting Information, Table S4). In this way,
we ensured that the different colocalization patterns among the tumor
types involved the molecules observed in all the samples. This strict
constraint was necessary because ion presence/absence patterns may
be a consequence of nonbiologically related mechanisms (e.g., different
tissue chemical matrices).

Isotopes were removed from the common m/z vector. These were identified as common m/z values that fell in the interval [m – k × 1.002, m + k × 1.0045], where  and m is a member of the
common m/z vector.36 A manual inspection was performed to identify and remove
possible isotopes left after the deisotoping procedure. The deisotoping
procedure aimed to reduce the number of final features, removing those
characterized by a redundant molecular information (isotopes are expected
to equally colocalize with their monoisotopic forms).

The test
set peaks were matched with the common m/z vector of the cross-validation set within a search
window of ±5 ppm. When multiple peaks matched, the m/z value of the most intense peak was selected.
If no matched peak was found, the intensity was left equal to 0 in
all the pixels. This procedure was intended to evaluate the performances
of the classification model with out-of-sample MS images (i.e., MS
images that are not part of the data set used for training the models).

Colocalization Features Extraction
The MSI images comprised
both tissue-related and tissue-unrelated (off-tissue areas) pixels.
In order to use the only tissue-related pixels for the calculation
of the colocalization features, a binary mask (region of interest,
ROI) representing the area of the image occupied by the tissue was
determined by applying the “kmeans2”
method from the SPUTNIK package for R.43 Four clusters were extracted by k-means applied to the entire MSI images, with the purpose of identifying
a finer segmentation of the MS image onto tissue-related and tissue-unrelated
areas. In this way, the tissue-related spectra characterized by signal
intensity close to the off-tissue areas could also be distinguished,
providing a more precise localization of the area occupied by the
tissue. The clusters that were not localized in the corners of the
image were merged to define the tissue-related ROI. This heuristic
rule was determined after visual inspection of the segmented images
(Supporting Information, Figure S1).

Spearman’s rank correlations between each pair of matched
peaks were calculated within each MS image using the only tissue-related
ROI pixels (Supporting Information, eqs 4 and 5). Being a rank-based quantity, Spearman’s rank correlation
is more robust to the presence of outliers, and it is insensitive
to the absolute values of the variables, which are also equivalent
to systematic variations.

The asymptotic t approximation44 was applied to determine the significance of
each correlation.
The correlations associated with a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value larger than 0.05 were set equal to 0. Subsequently,
the elements of the upper triangular correlation matrix (corresponding
to the correlations between different pairs of spectral peaks) were
vectorized and used as features for the image sample (Figure 1A).

Figure 1 Colocalization based
classification scheme. (A) The correlation
matrix is calculated from all the pairs of the MS ion images. The
upper triangular matrix elements are vectorized to define the feature
vector representing the MSI sample. (B) A classification model can
be fitted on the colocalization feature vectors and the corresponding
MSI sample labels.

Since the size of the
tissue-related ROI could differ from one
MS image to another, the Spearman’s rank correlations were
calculated on a fixed number of randomly selected pixels belonging
to the tissue-related ROI. Various sample sizes Npix = {100, 200, 300, ..., 1000} were tested.

No
smoothing or other spatially related intensity transformations
were applied to the ion images before calculating the correlations.

In the entire text, the terms colocalization and correlation are
treated as synonyms.

Supervised Modeling
The purpose
of the supervised model
was to predict the tumor type from the colocalization features of
an off-sample mass spectrometry image (Supporting Information, Methods 2). Partial Least Squares–Discriminant
Analysis (PLS-DA) algorithm was employed to fit the supervised models
on the colocalization features.

Given a fixed number of randomly
selected pixels Npix used for the extraction
of the colocalization features, the performance of the classifiers
was evaluated through a 10-fold cross-validation scheme applied to
the cross-validation set of MS images. In each round of the cross-validation,
the MS images belonging to the cross-validation set were split into
a training and validation sets, and a PLS-DA model was fitted on the
ordered pairs of vectors (fi,Yi), where i represents the generic index of
the training MS images, fi is the colocalization feature vector extracted from Npix ROI pixels of the i-th
MS image (Supporting Information, eq 3)
and Yi represents
the tissue section label, with Yi ∈ {breast, colorectal, ovarian}.

The performance of the models was evaluated by comparing the predicted
labels of the validation MS images with their true values Y–i, using the
colocalization features f–i, where “-i” denotes
the MS image indices that did not belong to the training set (Figure 1B). After all rounds
of the cross-validation, prediction accuracy, single class sensitivity,
and specificity were calculated as prediction performance metrics.
The performance metrics were calculated at end of the 10-fold cross
validation as a representative measure of the predictive power of
the model. A varying number of PLS-DA components K = {2, 3, 4, ..., 10} were tested.

Since the split of MS images
into training and validation sets
was generated randomly and this might affect the values of the performance
metrics, the 10-fold cross-validation was repeated 500 times. In each
repetition, the colocalization features were calculated using a different
set of random Npix tissue-related ROI
pixels.

The average metrics calculated over the 500 repetitions
were considered
as representative of the performance associated with the classification
parameters. By this approach, the maximum average accuracy was used
to determine the optimal number of PLS-DA components K* and the optimal number of the randomly selected pixels Npix*.

In order to test whether the prediction
performance observed with
the cross-validation set was due to overfitting, a PLS-DA with the
optimal number of components K* model was fitted
to the colocalization features of the entire cross-validation set
MS images, then extracted using the optimal number Npix* of randomly sampled pixels. After fitting the model,
the prediction performance was measured on the external test set MS
images. Similar to cross-validation, the entire procedure was repeated
500 times, and the final performance metrics were calculated as the
average of the metric values.

Mean Peak Intensities As
Representative Features of MS Images
A comparison with a
spectral mean-based procedure for whole MS
images classification was performed. Each MS image was represented
by a vector consisting of the mean intensities of the matched peaks,
calculated using the tissue-related ROI pixels only.

These vectors
were used as features for a PLS-DA supervised model. An identical
scheme to that employed with the colocalization features was used
to evaluate the best combination of a number of pixels and PLS-DA
components. The best mean accuracy obtained with this method was finally
compared with that obtained from the colocalization feature-based
classifiers.

All the scripts were developed in the R language45 and are available at https://github.com/paoloinglese/ion_colocalization.

Results
The preprocessing workflow applied to the cross-validation
set
resulted in 64 common peaks. When assigned to the 21 external test
set MS images, it resulted that one sample had one unmatched peak,
two samples had two unmatched peaks, and one sample had three unmatched
peaks. The small number of unmatched peaks suggested that the common
peaks determined by our procedure were generally present in the three
classes of tissues. The resulting 64 common peaks were annotated by
generating the sum formula from the exact mass measurements and by
searching the m/z values at the
online Metlin database, HMDB and SciFinder46−48 (Supporting Information, Table S4). An m/z error threshold 5 ppm was used to accept
the putative annotation.

Further structural elucidation was
performed using MS/MS experiments
via collision-induced dissociation on the LTQ-Discovery MS instrument
(Thermo Scientific). For the annotation of metabolites, the MS/MS
spectra were matched against spectral libraries from HMDB, NIST, and
Metlin that were compiled with either authentic standards or theoretical
assignment. Identification of metabolites whose MS/MS spectra are
not present in the spectral libraries remained challenging, and ions
were annotated based on a known chemical rule-based fragmentation
pattern. For the structural assignment of glycerophospholipids, fragments
of the polar headgroup or the fatty acyl chains were investigated
to confirm the annotation proposed by the databases and discriminate
isomers.

Colocalization Feature Variance Converges to Zero with a Larger
Sets of Pixels
A first analysis aimed to determine the variability
of the 2016 colocalization values due to the randomness of the ROI
pixels used to extract the features. The variance of the entire colocalization
vector values across the 500 repetitions was calculated for each MS
image (Supporting Information, Methods 1.5). As expected, with an increasing number of pixels, the variances
converged to 0. In particular, with a sample size larger than 200
pixels, the colocalization features variance was smaller than 0.01
(Figure 2).

Figure 2 Variance of
the colocalization vectors values. The red dots represent
the median of each MS image colocalization features calculated over
the 500 repetitions using Np randomly
sampled pixels. The bands represent the 1.4826 * MAD distance from
the median. The plot shows that the variance of the colocalization
features converged to zero with an increasing number of pixels, suggesting
that the features were almost independent from the used pixels with
samples larger than 300 pixels.

Performance of Colocalization-Based Models
The 2016
Spearman’s correlations were used as colocalization features
for the PLS-DA models. A number Npix*
= 900 of randomly sampled pixels and K* = 7 PLS-DA
components corresponded to the maximum average accuracy across the
500 repeated 10-fold cross-validations (Supporting Information, eq 6; Figure 3), equal to 0.9158 ± 0.0262 (Table 1). A comparison with the accuracies
obtained after permuting the MS image labels confirmed that the observed
performances were not due to random chance (Supporting Information, Figure S2). The optimal number of sampled pixels Npix* = 900 represented a percentage of the tissue-related
ROI size varying from 6% to 75%, with a median of 21% across all tissue
sections.

The PLS-DA model trained on the whole cross-validation set

of 0.8059 ± 0.0346 (Table 1). This result confirmed that the model was adequately capable
of distinguishing between tumor types.

classification models using the mass spectral intensities as features
resulted in lower cross-validation performances compared to the colocalization-based
models, with an average and standard deviation accuracy of 0.8138
± 0.0324 (Supporting Information, Figure S3).

Bias Analysis of the Three Data Sets
Since the data
sets used in this study were obtained from three different studies,
we tested for the presence of batch effect that could cause bias in
the fitted models.

Two types of batch effects were considered
as possibly related with the ion colocalization. First, a systematic
variation of the scatteredness of the ion images among the three data
sets. Second, a batch effect represented by a systematic variation
in the peak intensities associated with the three data sets.

Given an ion image, its scatteredness was defined as the ratio
between the number of pixels in non-zero-intensity connected regions
(two pixels are connected if they are 1-nearest-neighbors) and the
total number of non-zero-intensity pixels in the tissue-related ROI.
This measure was intended to capture the degree of sparsity of the
image since more sparse images are characterized by larger fractions
of disconnected signal pixels. Being based on ion image correlations,
the colocalization features could be therefore affected by a systematic
difference of the scatteredness in the three data sets.

In order
to determine the presence of a scatteredness batch effect,
a univariate Kruskal–Wallis49 test
was performed on the scatteredness of each ion images of the three
data sets MS images. Specifically, for each ion, the value of scatteredness
was calculated for all of the 48 MS images, and the test was used
to determine whether a significant difference was present between
the three data sets. After a Benjamini-Hochberg correction, none of
the 64 ion scatterednesses was found different in the three datasets,
at a level of significance of 5% (Figure 4).

Figure 4 (Left) Box plot showing the scatteredness of
the ion images of
the three sets of MS images. (Right) Box plot of the combined scatteredness
of the three main tissue types. A Kruskal–Wallis test resulted
in no difference between the tissue types at a level of significance
of 5%.

The peak intensity batch effect
was tested similarly. All the peak
intensities of all the MS images were combined, and a Kruskal–Wallis
test was performed to determine if a significant difference was observed
between the three data sets. In this case, a significant difference
(p < 1e-5) between the three data sets was observed
(Figure 5A-B).

Figure 5 Box plot of
the preprocessed peak intensities of the 48 MS images
belonging to the cross-validation set (A) and combined in the three
main tissue types (B). A Kruskal–Wallis test resulted in a
difference in the intensity distribution between the tissue types,
at a significance level of 95%. After standardization (C, D), no significant
difference was found between the peak intensities of the three tissue
types.

In order to test whether this
systematic variation was responsible
for the performance of the colocalization-based PLS-DA models, we
repeated the classification using batch-effect corrected peak intensities.
Peak intensities were standardized within each MS image. Specifically,
for each MS image, intensities of individual peaks were centered using
their mean values and scaled dividing by their standard deviation.
After applying the scaling, no significant difference was observed
between the three data sets at a level of significance of 5% (Figure 5C,D).

Using
the optimal parameters, Npix*
= 900 and K* = 7, the cross-validation accuracy with
the colocalization features of the standardized intensities was almost
identical to that observed using the unscaled intensities, with the
results equal to 0.9157 ± 0.0269. This result confirmed that
the colocalization features were insensitive to the relative differences
of peak intensities between the three data sets.

Colocalization
Features Are Less Sensitive to Batch Effect
In order to test
the robustness of the colocalization features
to peaks intensity batch effects, we performed a series of tests with
the application of simulated intensity offsets. In each set of experiments,
the MS images from only one tissue type were considered. First, all
the peak intensities were standardized (as described in the previous
section). Afterward, a numeric offset was applied to the peak intensities
in half of the 16 MS images. This offset was different for each pixel
and peak (to simulate also small variations within the MS images)
and randomly sampled from a Normal distribution with a varying mean
in 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2 and a standard deviation equal to 0.1.

The aim of this approach was to determine whether a PLS-DA model
was capable of distinguishing MS images with or without the applied
offset. A good accuracy would then imply that the features are sensitive
to the presence of systematic variations.

A classification procedure
similar to that described in the previous
sections was applied, with the only difference of using a leave-one-out
cross-validation, due to the smaller number of tested samples (16
MS images per tissue type).

Performance was calculated using
the colocalization features and
the mean peak intensity features for comparison purposes.

As
expected, the results showed that colocalization features are
much less sensitive to systematic variations than the mean peaks intensity
features, with the latter giving an accuracy of 1.0 with offsets sampled
from a normal distribution with mean equal to 0.1. In contrast, the
accuracy of the colocalization features remained almost constant (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Best accuracies for the
discrimination between MS images with or
without applied offset. The results show that the mean peaks intensities
were significantly more sensitive to the applied offsets, allowing
the PLS-DA models to predict them correctly. On the contrary, the
PLS-DA models trained on the colocalization features performed almost
identically, irrespective of the offset distribution, confirming that
these features are more robust to systematic variations of the peak
intensities.

Univariate Test of Colocalization
Features and Visualization
A multiple pairwise univariate
Kruskal–Wallis test was employed
to determine the colocalization features that were significantly different
between the three tumor types. The features selected with more than
a 5% significance level (after Benjamini-Hochberg correction, with
a number of tests equal to 3 × 500) were further investigated
to identify the most informative colocalization patterns for the discrimination
of the three tumor classes. It was observed that, across the 500 repetitions,
the number of significantly different correlations were stable (Supporting Information, Figure S4). The features
that were significant in 95% of the 500 repetitions were used for
the following analysis. Their overall significance was calculated
as the average adjusted p-values across the 500 repetitions,
and the features were sorted by their overall significance (increasing p-value order).

The 10 most significant correlations
are reported in Supporting Information, Table S6, together with the elemental composition corresponding to
the absolute m/z differences between
the ion pairs associated with the selected correlations that can provide
information about the possible chemical interactions.

The spatial
localization of these ions could be investigated by
plotting the relative abundance images of the spectral peaks involved
in the selected correlations (the spatial distribution of the most
significant correlation is reported in Supporting Information, Figure S5). These images confirmed that these
ions were localized in tissue-related areas and did not involve off-tissue
regions of the images. In order to compare the spatial distributions
of the ion pairs involved in the selected correlations with the corresponding
optical images of the H&E stained tissue, we segmented the MS
image into two clusters. The main cluster (represented by the yellow
pixels in Supporting Information, Figure S6) represented the pixels where both correlated ions had a higher
relative abundance than their average value. In this way, it resulted
that the ions associated with the most significantly different correlations
in the breast/colorectal, and colorectal/ovarian contrasts were mainly
localized in the tumor region, whereas in the breast/ovarian contrast,
they were mainly localized in the connective tissue (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Example of the spatial
patterns associated with the most significant
correlation in the three contrasts. The shown DESI-MS images had the
closest selected correlation values to the median within the tissue
group. The selected correlation ions are mainly localized in the tumor
tissue (delineated by a black line in the H&E optical images)
for the breast/colorectal (A) and colorectal/ovarian (C) contrasts,
whereas it is mainly localized in the connective tissue in the breast/ovarian
(B) contrast, as revealed by the clusters (third column). The yellow
pixels represent the regions of the tissue where the two ions have
a relative abundance higher than the average value within the MS image.
In the second column, the ion pairs abundances (scaled in [0, 1])
are represented as red and green channels of an RGB image. The Spearman’s
correlation values (r) are reported on the left side.

For each repetition, the selected
correlation features associated
with the three pairwise comparisons were averaged across the MS images
of each tissue class as representative values of their group. Afterward,
a circle plot of the average of the repeated values revealed the different
colocalization patterns between each pair of tissue class (Figure 8).

Figure 8 Circle plots representing
the correlation features that were significantly
different in the three pairwise contrasts. Each row represents the
significant correlations averaged across the MS images of the tissue
class and the 500 repetitions. Positive correlations are plotted in
green, whereas negative correlations are colored in red. Each dot
represents the molecule ion involved in the colocalization feature,
with a darker color for nodes that were involved in higher absolute
average values of correlations. The graphs illustrate clear differences
in colocalization patterns between the three tumor types.

A graph representing the significant correlations
was determined
from each pairwise tumor comparison. The average correlations calculated
across the 500 repetitions within the same tumor class were used as
the edges of a circle graph, whereas the peak m/z corresponding to the ion pairs were assigned to the nodes
(Figure 8). This graph
revealed the different colocalization patterns associated with the
three types of tumors. Following the assumption behind the workflow
presented, these patterns can be used to generate hypotheses based
on the interactions that distinguish the biochemical characteristics
of the different cancer types.

Discussion
Mass
spectrometry imaging is gaining increased interest as a technology
capable of mapping the spatial distribution of the molecules of interest
in two- or three-dimensional clinical samples. However, the quantitative
analysis of imaging data is still limited due to difficulties controlling
factors such as chemical matrix effects. Ion colocalization analysis,
however, can represent a more robust alternative toward more quantitative
analysis of this kind of data. Colocalization features are insensitive
to peak intensity batch effects, as seen from experiments on the simulated
intensity offsets. This result highlights one of the main advantages
of the colocalization feature representation, allowing the comparison
between MS images obtained from different studies.

Biologically,
the workflow exploits the assumption that local metabolic
pathways are expressed through colocalization patterns of the molecules
involved in the mechanisms. The two strongest types of biological
correlations are observed (i) when the two correlated species are
the substrate and the product of the same enzyme, or (ii) when both
are products or both are substrates of the same enzyme/transporter.
Typical examples for both cases are shown in Supporting Information, Table S5, which summarizes the strongest correlations
for the individual data sets. The strongest correlation (0.92) in
the entire data set was found to be between PA(36:1) and PS(18:0/18:1);
one is a potential precursor assuming formation via phospholipase
D activity. Overexpression of phospholipase D is one of the common
hallmarks of epithelial cancers, activating antiapoptotic pathways.50 Examples for parallel biosynthesis of species
showing strong correlations include PG(18:1/18:1) and PG(18:1/18:2),
which are the products of the same phosphoglycolate phosphatase.

Specifically, we hypothesize that different classes of samples
(different tumor types in this case) are characterized by diverse
metabolic pathways. This hypothesis was corroborated by the high predictive
power of the supervised models. A similar performance was observed
in an external test set, confirming the robustness of the models.
The method outperformed the classification performance when the mean
spectral intensities were used as features.

Interestingly, we
observed a small variance for the colocalization
features, with a value of about 0.01 for samples of 300 pixels. Therefore,
most of the variation observed in the classification performance metrics
was due to the different splits into training/validation sets in each
repetition. In other words, we did not observe subregions characterized
by different colocalization patterns (e.g., two ions were positively
correlated in a portion of the tissue and anticorrelated in another
subregion) inside the same tissue section. This can be a result due
either to underlying stability of the detected biochemical mechanisms
or to the technical limitations of the analytical technique employed
to generate the MS image.

Additionally, the colocalization patterns
can be used for data-driven
hypothesis generation, suggesting possible local molecular mechanisms
characterizing the samples of interest. The visualization of the most
significantly correlated ions can help to determine regions of interest
for further experiments, through data integration with transcriptomics
or simply by inspection of the stained samples for histopathological
validation, in the case of tissue sections. When represented as a
graph, the significant correlations reveal patterns that could be
used as a part of the hypothesis generation process.

Both positive
and negative correlations were considered as feature
values for representing the MS images. Positive correlations may indicate
the presence of one or multiple mechanisms locally involving the detected
molecules, whereas negative correlations may be seen as reflecting
competitive processes like COX1/2, in which arachidonic acid is used
as a common precursor, whereas prostaglandins PG H2 and PG G2 are
produced depending on the COX expression.51 However, MSI data alone cannot provide conclusive evidence of such
mechanisms.

Another limitation of the method is characterized
by the representativeness
of the specimens studied. A single tissue section may be not representative
of the complex heterogeneity of the tumor. For this reason, multiple
sections or three-dimensional specimens may give a more robust representation
of the molecular composition of the analyzed samples.15

The dimensionality of the colocalization features
defined in the
presented work is |V|(|V| –
1)/2, where |V| represents the number of spectral
peaks. For this reason, when a large number of spectral peaks are
available, then the colocalization feature vectors dimensionality
can become computationally intractable. In such situations, feature
selection methods (e.g., Random Forest variable importance) may help
to reduce the number of features used to train the classification
models.

In the future, various similarity measures will be tested
for the
quantification of the degree of ion colocalization in cancer tissue
and MSI data from different sources. Additionally, biologically related
hypotheses generated by the ion colocalization patterns will be thoroughly
investigated through extensive experimental validation, involving
transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry measurements.
