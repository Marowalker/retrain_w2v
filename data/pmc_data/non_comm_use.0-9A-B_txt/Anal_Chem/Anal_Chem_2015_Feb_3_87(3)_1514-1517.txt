Two of the most widely measured compounds
in the urine of people
who use tobacco products are cotinine, a major metabolite of the addictive
constituent nicotine, and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol
(NNAL), a metabolite of the powerful lung carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone
(NNK). Thousands of analyses have been reported in the literature,
carried out exclusively, to the best of our knowledge, by separate
methods. In the study reported here, we have developed a sensitive,
accurate, and precise liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem
mass spectrometry-selected reaction monitoring method for the combined
analysis of total cotinine (the sum of cotinine and its glucuronide)
and total NNAL (the sum of NNAL and its glucuronide). The new method
quantifies naturally occurring [13C]cotinine to minimize
problems associated with the vast differences in concentration of
total cotinine and total NNAL in urine. This method should greatly
facilitate future determinations of these important compounds.

==== Body
In spite
of their widely known
adverse health effects, tobacco products continue to be a major cause
of disease and death, with the average annual smoking-attributable
mortality for the United States for 2010–2014 estimated at
500 000 premature deaths, while worldwide the total number
of deaths attributable to tobacco use was approximately 6 million.1,2 It does not seem that the worldwide use of tobacco products will
diminish significantly in the near future. Two of the most important
compounds in tobacco products are nicotine, its major known addictive
constituent responsible in large measure for maintenance of the tobacco
habit, and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), a
powerful lung carcinogen in laboratory animals which is widely viewed
as one of the most dangerous compounds in tobacco products with respect
to lung cancer etiology3−6 (see structures in Figure 1). The uptake
of these compounds by people who use tobacco products or are exposed
to secondhand smoke has been extensively studied by quantifying two
characteristic urinary metabolites: cotinine, a major metabolite of
nicotine, and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL),
a metabolite of NNK (Figure 1). These metabolites
occur in urine partially as glucuronide conjugates and are often measured
after treatment of the urine with β-glucuronidase, thus giving
“total cotinine” and “total NNAL.” Total
cotinine and total NNAL, which are virtually unique to users of tobacco
products and related materials, or people exposed to secondhand tobacco
smoke, are excellent indicators of tobacco dose and are directly associated
with lung cancer risk in smokers.7 The
literature contains data on total cotinine and total NNAL in urine
samples from many thousands of people.3,6,8−17

of nicotine, NNK, cotinine, NNAL, and the internal standards
used in the analysis.

Current methodology for quantitation of urinary cotinine
and NNAL
(free or total) is based almost exclusively on tandem mass spectrometry.
As far as we are aware, all studies reported to date, regardless of
methodology, have measured urinary cotinine and NNAL separately.3,6,8−17 The use of separate methods presumably is related in part to the
huge difference in concentrations of total cotinine versus total NNAL
in urine. Typical average total cotinine concentrations in urine are
about 5000–15 000 times greater than those of total
NNAL, which can introduce problems associated with dynamic range.
In the study reported here, we have solved this problem by analyzing
for naturally occurring total [13C]cotinine, thus developing
what is apparently the first combined method for analysis of total
NNAL and total cotinine in urine.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Cotinine, [13CD3]cotinine,
NNAL, and [13C6]NNAL (Figure 1) were procured from Toronto Research Chemicals (Ontario,
Canada). Recombinant β-glucuronidase (catalog # G8295) was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). True Taper 96-well plates for
sample processing and analysis were from Analytical Sales & Services
(Pompton Plains, NJ) while silicone cap mats used to cover the 96-well
plates were purchased from Phenomenex (Torrance, CA). Four hundred
microliter Isolute SLE+ diatomaceous earth solid-phase extraction
96-well plates were from Biotage (Charlotte, NC) while Oasis MCX 10
mg, 30 μm solid-phase extraction 96-well plates were from Waters
(Milford, MA). A Cerex 96-well positive pressure processor (Chromtech,
Apple Valley, MN) was utilized during sample processing. Dulbecco’s
PBS was purchased from Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY), and the rest
of the chemicals were obtained from either Fisher Scientific (Fairlawn,
NJ), Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI), or Alfa Aesar (WardHill, MA) and
used without further purification unless otherwise noted. An Eppendorf
multichannel pipettor was used during sample processing.

Urine Samples
The urine samples were obtained from
ongoing studies of the University of Minnesota Tobacco Research Programs,
approved by the University of Minnesota Institutional Review Board,
code number 0908M70881. Two types of urine samples were used in the
validation studies. The pooled smokers’ urine sample was obtained
by combining urine from 8 subjects, each of whom smoked about 20 cigarettes
per day, and contributed between 150 and 320 mL from a 24 h urine
collection. The pooled smokeless tobacco users’ urine sample
was obtained by combining 1 mL each of urine samples from 68 subjects
who used an average of 3.68 tins of smokeless tobacco per week. Upon
validation of the method, urine samples from 85 smokers were used
to compare the results for total cotinine and total NNAL from the
new combined method to those from previously existing methods.

Combined
Analysis of Total Cotinine and Total NNAL in Urine
Urine
samples that were previously frozen at −20 °C
were thawed at 4 °C overnight, and 250 μL aliquots were
added to 96-well plates. [13CD3]cotinine (110
pmol) and [13C6]NNAL (0.93 pmol) were dissolved
in 50 μL of pH 7.4 phosphate buffered saline (4.24 mM KH2PO4, 620.7 mM NaCl, 11.86 mM Na2HPO4) and added to each well along with 3000 units of β-glucuronidase
in 50 μL of pH 7.4 phosphate buffered saline (1.06 mM KH2PO4, 155.2 mM NaCl, 2.97 mM Na2HPO4). The plates were capped with silicone cap mats and incubated
in a shaking water bath at 37 °C overnight.

The mixtures
in the 96-well plates were transferred onto Isolute SLE+ 96-well plates.
A short mild burst of N2 was used to push the liquid mixture
through the frits. The aqueous solution was allowed to absorb onto
the diatomaceous earth for 5 min and then eluted 6 times, each with
0.3 mL of CH2Cl2. After all the eluents were
collected through gravity in a True Taper collection plate, the remainder
of the material in the Isolute SLE+ 96-well plates was eluted with
the aid of a Cerex-processor and a slow stream of N2. The
combined eluents were then dried under vacuum in a SpeedVac for 1–1.5
h.

The samples were further purified by a second solid-phase
extraction
using Oasis MCX 96-well plates. The dried samples were reconstituted
in 250 μL of 1 N HCl by sonication for 15 min. The MCX plates
were equilibrated with 1 mL of CH3OH followed by 2 mL of
H2O. The reconstituted samples were then added to the MCX
plate. The True Taper plate was washed with another 250 μL of
1 N HCl. The MCX plates were then successively washed with 250 μL
each of 1 N HCl, CH3OH, and 90:5:5 H2O/CH3OH/NH4OH (v/v/v). The analytes were collected by
elution with 35:60:5 H2O/CH3OH/NH4OH (v/v/v) and dried under vacuum in a SpeedVac overnight. Samples
were stored at −20 °C until analysis and then dissolved
in 50 μL of 5 mM NH4OAc; 8 μL of each sample
was analyzed.

LC-ESI+-MS/MS was performed with an
Ultra triple quadrupole
mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh PA) interfaced with
a Waters Nano Acquity HPLC system. Chromatographic separation was
achieved using a Luna C18 (2) 5 μ, 150 × 0.5 mm column
(Phenomenex) eluted at a flow rate of 10 μL/min at 40 °C.
The HPLC solvents were 15% CH3CN in H2O (v/v,
solvent A) and CH3CN (solvent B). Isocratic elution with
10% solvent B/90% solvent A for 8 min was used to quantify the analytes.
Cotinine and [13CD3]cotinine eluted at 5.12
min while NNAL and [13C6]NNAL eluted at 5.46
min. A column wash was incorporated after every eighth sample, using
10% B/90% A for 10 min followed by an increase to 100% B in 1 min
and then isocratic elution with B for 4 min. Then, the column was
equilibrated with 10% B/90% A for 5 min. The transitions monitored
were m/z 178.08 → m/z 98.14 for cotinine, m/z 181.12
→ m/z 102.09 for [13CD3]cotinine; m/z 210.13
→ m/z 93.16 (quantifier)
and m/z 210.13 → m/z 180.20 (qualifier)
for NNAL; m/z 216.14 → m/z 98.14 and m/z 216.14 → m/z 186.18
for [13C6]NNAL. The m/z 178.08 ion monitored
for cotinine is the [M + H]+ ion resulting from naturally
occurring [13C]cotinine. Typical spray voltage was 2.5
kV, and a capillary temperature of 270 °C was used. Typical tube
lens offset values were 67 V for cotinine and 60 V for NNAL. N2 was used as the sheath gas (25 counts). Quantitative analyses
were conducted in the SRM mode, with collision energy of 16 V for
cotinine and 9 and 17 V for NNAL. Ar was the collision gas with a
pressure of 1.1 mTorr. MS/MS analyses were performed using a scan
width of m/z 0.2 and a scan time
of 0.125 s. Quadrupole resolution was achieved with Q1 set at m/z 0.5 and Q3 set at m/z 0.7.

Accuracy and Precision
Accuracy
of the cotinine analysis
was determined by spiking a pooled urine sample from 8 smokers, which
contained 20.8 nmol total cotinine/mL urine, with cotinine at concentrations
of 5.1, 10.1, 20.2, 40.4, or 80.9 nmol/mL urine, and carrying out
the analysis. Similarly, a pooled urine sample from 68 smokeless tobacco
users containing 21.4 nmol total cotinine/mL urine was spiked with
cotinine at concentrations of 5.1, 10.1, 20.2, 40.4, or 80.9 nmol/mL
urine. For NNAL, the same urine sample from smokers, which contained
1.8 pmol/mL total NNAL, was spiked with NNAL at concentrations of
0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 pmol/mL urine while that from smokeless
tobacco users, which contained 3.3 pmol/mL total NNAL, was spiked
with 2.8, 4.2, 5.6, 8.4, and 14.0 pmol/mL urine.

Precision was
determined by replicate analysis of these urine samples with no addition
of cotinine or NNAL. Six replicates were carried out for the urine
samples from smokers and 3 for those from smokeless tobacco users.
Each replicate analysis was carried out on 3 separate days.

Method
Comparison
The results of the new method were
compared to those obtained upon analysis of the same samples by traditional
separate methods, as described previously for total NNAL11 and total cotinine.17

Results and Discussion
The analytical method is summarized
in Scheme 1. [13CD3]cotinine
and [13C6]NNAL (Figure 1) were used as
internal standards. Urine samples were partially purified by successive
solid-phase extractions using diatomaceous earth and mixed mode cation
exchange-reverse phase 96-well plates. The appropriate fraction was
analyzed by LC-ESI-MS/MS. A key feature of this method for analysis
of cotinine was monitoring of the m/z 178.08 peak of cotinine, which is the [M + H]+ ion of
naturally occurring [13C]cotinine, comprising 11% of the
[12C]cotinine [M + H]+ ion. This strategy resulted
in an approximate 20-fold decrease in the cotinine
signal, diminishing problems associated with the large difference
in concentrations of total cotinine and total NNAL in each urine sample.

Scheme 1 Outline of the Method for Combined Analysis of Total Cotinine and
Total NNAL in Human Urine
Typical LC-ESI-MS/MS chromatograms of a smoker’s
urine sample
are illustrated in Figure 2A–D. Figure 2A,C shows the peaks for [13C]cotinine
and the internal standard [13CD3]cotinine while
Figure 2B,D illustrate the corresponding peaks
used for quantitation of NNAL and internal standard [13C6]NNAL. For [13C]cotinine, m/z 178.08 is the protonated molecular ion while m/z 98.14 is the pyrrolidinone ion. For
NNAL, m/z 210.13 is the protonated
molecular ion and m/z 93.16 corresponds
to [pyrH–CH2]+. The cotinine peak in
Figure 2A was only 7 times greater in intensity
than the NNAL peak in Figure 2B. Chromatograms
of similar quality were obtained upon analysis of urine samples from
smokeless tobacco users. Limits of quantitation were 0.06 pmol/mL
urine for NNAL and 0.42 nmol/mL urine for cotinine.

a pooled smokers’ urine sample for total cotinine and total
NNAL. Panels A and B, analytes; Panels C and D, internal standards.

Figure 3 Accuracy results for total cotinine in the urine
of smokers (Panel
A) and smokeless tobacco users (Panel B) and total NNAL in the urine
of smokers (Panel C) and smokeless tobacco users (Panel D). Increasing
amounts of cotinine or NNAL were added to the urine samples which
were analyzed by the new combined method. The y-intercept
represents the amount present in each pooled sample before addition
of cotinine or NNAL.

Accuracy was determined by adding various amounts of cotinine
or
NNAL to urine samples from smokers and smokeless tobacco users and
performing the assay. As illustrated in Figure 3A–D, there was a linear relationship between added and observed
amounts. For cotinine, the y-intercept was 20.9 nmol/mL
in urine samples from smokers (Figure 3A),
consistent with the 20.8 nmol/mL amount determined in these samples
when no cotinine was added. The average accuracy, determined by comparing
added and measured amounts at each level of addition, was 99.2%. The
corresponding figure for urine samples from smokeless tobacco users
(Figure 3B) shows a y-intercept
of 21.5 nmol/mL versus a level of 21.4 nmol/mL when no cotinine was
added and an average accuracy of 98.7%. For total NNAL in smokers’
urine, the y-intercept (Figure 3C) gave a value of 1.84 pmol/mL compared to an expected value of
1.8 pmol/mL, and the average accuracy was 98.3%; while in the urine
from smokeless tobacco users (Figure 3D), the y-intercept was 3.15 compared to an expected value of 3.3
pmol/mL, and the average accuracy was 98.1%.

Precision was determined
by replicate analyses of the urine samples
at zero spiked level, 6 replicates from smokers and 3 from smokeless
tobacco users, analyzed once per day over 3 days. Intraday and interday
precision (coefficient of variation, in %) for cotinine in smokers’
urine were 1.2% and 1.1%, respectively, while the corresponding figures
in smokeless tobacco users’ urine were 0.7% and 0.6%. For total
NNAL, intraday and interday precision were 4.4% and 2.7% in smokers’
urine and 0.8% and 0.9% in smokeless tobacco users’ urine.
Average levels of total cotinine and total NNAL in these samples were
20.9 nmol/mL and 1.6 pmol/mL urine, respectively, in smokers’
urine and 21.5 nmol/mL and 2.8 pmol/mL, respectively, in smokeless
tobacco users’ urine.

The new combined method was further
validated by comparing the
results to those obtained by the traditional separate methods for
analysis of total cotinine and total NNAL in urine samples from 85
smokers. The results, which are presented in Figure 4A,B, show excellent correlation between the data from the
traditional and new methods.

Figure 4 Comparison of data obtained upon analysis of
total cotinine (panel
A) and total NNAL (panel B) in the urine of 85 smokers by the traditional
separate methods and the combined method.

The results presented here constitute, to the best of our
knowledge,
the first report in the literature of a combined method for quantitation
of total cotinine and total NNAL in the urine of people who use tobacco
products. The method could also be adapted to studies quantifying
these metabolites in the urine of nonsmokers exposed to secondhand
smoke. Our solution to the problem of a huge dynamic range, which
can inhibit quantitation of both of these important compounds, was
to decrease the sensitivity of cotinine detection by analysis of naturally
occurring [13C]cotinine in the samples. The resulting method
has great accuracy and precision and compares favorably to previous
separate methods for determination of these important metabolites.
This innovative method will facilitate analysis of total cotinine
and total NNAL as well as decrease the cost of these analyses by about
30% in future studies of uptake of the important compounds nicotine
and NNK in people who use tobacco products.
