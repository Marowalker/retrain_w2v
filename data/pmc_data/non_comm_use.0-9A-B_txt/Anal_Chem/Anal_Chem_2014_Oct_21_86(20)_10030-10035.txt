The
matrix application technique is critical to the success of
a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) experiment.
This work presents a systematic study aiming to evaluate three different
matrix application techniques for MALDI mass spectrometric imaging
(MSI) of endogenous metabolites from legume plant, Medicago
truncatula, root nodules. Airbrush, automatic sprayer, and
sublimation matrix application methods were optimized individually
for detection of metabolites in the positive ionization mode exploiting
the two most widely used MALDI matrices, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid
(DHB) and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA). Analytical
reproducibility and analyte diffusion were examined and compared side-by-side
for each method. When using DHB, the optimized method developed for
the automatic matrix sprayer system resulted in approximately double
the number of metabolites detected when compared to sublimation and
airbrush. The automatic sprayer method also showed more reproducible
results and less analyte diffusion than the airbrush method. Sublimation
matrix deposition yielded high spatial resolution and reproducibility
but fewer analytes in the higher m/z range (500–1000 m/z). When
the samples were placed in a humidity chamber after sublimation, there
was enhanced detection of higher mass metabolites but increased analyte
diffusion in the lower mass range. When using CHCA, the optimized
automatic sprayer method and humidified sublimation method resulted
in double the number of metabolites detected compared to standard
airbrush method.

==== Body
Metabolomics
is a growing field
with many important biological applications including biomarker discovery,
deciphering metabolic pathways in plants and other biological systems,
and toxicology profiling.1−7 Studying the metabolome of a cell/organism can provide insights
into its actual biochemical state.8 Most
techniques currently used for metabolomics require tissue extracts,
but knowing the location of a biomolecule within a specific tissue
can reveal key insights into its role and function within the organism.9−11 Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometric imaging
(MALDI-MSI) has become a powerful tool to visualize the distribution
of a wide range of molecules directly within biological tissues.12−20

MALDI requires deposition of an organic, crystalline compound,
known as matrix, on the tissue of interest to assist analyte desorption
and ionization.16 The matrix application
technique plays a crucial role in the quality of mass spectral images,
especially when obtaining high spatial resolution images.21−23 Among other instrumental parameters, such as raster step size, laser
beam diameter, etc., spatial resolution and reproducibility of results
are also limited by the matrix crystal size and application consistency.23,24 In this work, three matrix application methods were systematically
optimized and compared: airbrush, automatic sprayer, and sublimation.
Airbrush matrix application has been widely used in MALDI imaging6,15,17,25,26 and is relatively fast and simple. The major
limitation of airbrush matrix application is that the velocity of
the spray is controlled manually and cannot be strictly monitored.
This causes the quality of the spray to be extremely user dependent
and is often not reproducible. Variations in the spray velocity and
duration cause inconsistent application, and applying too much solvent
to the tissue can cause analyte diffusion, especially when working
with small molecules.22 Automatic sprayer
systems, such as the TM-Sprayer from HTX Technologies, have been developed
to remove the variability seen with manual airbrush application by
robotically controlling the temperature, solvent flow rate, velocity
of the matrix spraying nozzle during each pass, and number of passes.
Using an automatic sprayer system, the matrix density and crystal
size can be much more uniform, making the experimental results more
reproducible; however, this method is more time-consuming than matrix
application performed with an airbrush. Sublimation is a solvent-free
matrix application technique that is becoming more and more popular
for mass spectral imaging of metabolites and small molecules.27 Sublimation reduces analyte diffusion because
there is no solvent sprayed directly onto the tissue that can delocalize
small molecules. The drawback of this method is that the lack of solvent
causes some compounds to go undetected;28 however, placing the sample in a humidity chamber, post-sublimation,
may extract these higher mass compounds.

In this work, we optimized
and compared the utilization of three
matrix application techniques, exploiting the two most widely used
MALDI matrices, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic
acid (CHCA), using the metabolome of Medicago truncatula root and nodule tissue as a model. Previously, metabolites of various
chemical species, including amino acids, sugars, organic acids, lipids,
flavonoids, and their conjugates, were characterized and mapped on M. truncatula roots and nodules using the conventional matrix,
DHB, applied manually with an airbrush.6 Improving the matrix application technique for high spatial resolution
imaging of small molecules holds promise for better mechanistic understanding
of biological pathways and processes in M. truncatula, and the methodology developed for small molecule MSI can be transferred
to many other important biological systems and applications. Previous
publications reported on comparison and optimization of one matrix
application method for a variety of matrices,21,29,30 comparison between dry coating and spray
matrix application methods,31−33 or comparison between two different
spray methods.22,34 Herein, we present a detailed
optimization process for three different matrix application techniques
with a focus on studying endogenous small molecules. We report an
automatic sprayer method that can achieve sublimation-like imaging
results and a sublimation procedure that can detect a larger number
of higher mass metabolites than the traditional sublimation technique.

Materials
and Methods
M. truncatula plants were grown
and prepared for
MSI (see the Supporting Information for
details). Matrix deposition was carried out using three different
techniques: airbrush (Paasche Airbrush Company, Chicago, IL, USA)
coupled with a 75 mL steel container, TM-Sprayer system (HTX Technologies,
LLC, Carrboro, NC, USA), and a sublimation apparatus (Chemglass Life
Science, Vineland, NJ, USA). The concentration of matrix applied with
an airbrush was 150 mg/mL DHB (in 0.1% formic acid and 50% methanol)
or 10 mg/mL CHCA (in 0.1% formic acid and 70% methanol), and the airbrush
was held 35 cm from the plate. Ten or more coatings were applied;
the spray duration was 15 s with a 30 s dry time between each coating.
For sublimation matrix deposition, 300 mg of dry DHB or CHCA was weighed
out into the reservoir of the sublimation apparatus. Two previously
reported methods and adaptations of these previously reported methods
were performed and compared for optimized reproducibility, metabolite
detection, and signal intensity. For matrix application with the automatic
sprayer, 40 mg/mL DHB (in 0.1% formic acid and 50% methanol) or 10
mg/mL CHCA (in 0.1% formic acid and 70% methanol) was used as matrix.
The temperature, nozzle velocity, solvent flow rate, and number of
passes were systematically changed and optimized. Methods previously
reported by HTX Imaging Technologies and novel methods were investigated
and compared for optimized reproducibility, metabolite detection,
and signal intensity. MSI was carried out using an ultrafleXtreme
MALDI-TOF/TOF, and metabolites were identified on the basis of accurate
mass matching and MS/MS fragmentation6 (see
the Supporting Information for details).
SI Table 1, Supporting Information, lists
the identified metabolites shown in subsequent figures, and SI Figures
1–5, Supporting Information, show
MS/MS spectra of the metabolites detected in the Medicago root nodules
compared to metabolite standards in order to confirm the metabolite
identifications.

Results and Discussion
Airbrush Matrix Application
Previous work used the
well-established airbrush application as described above to map metabolites
in root nodules and neuropeptides in crustacean tissue with MALDI-MSI.6,15,35 The quality of the matrix application
varies greatly depending on the skill and preference of the user.

Sublimation Matrix Application
For DHB, two previously
reported methods21,27 and two adaptations of these
previously reported methods were performed and compared for optimized
reproducibility, metabolite detection, and signal intensity. A summary
of the parameters used for each of the four methods is listed in SI
Table 2, Supporting Information. Method
1, reported by Hankin et al.,27 started
at room temperature (RT) and gradually increased to 110 °C. The
procedure reported by Thomas et al.21 (Method
2) required a temperature
of 140 °C, but a drop in temperature was observed as the sublimation
apparatus was placed into the heating mantle. Therefore, in the method
adapted from this procedure (Method 3), the temperature was initially
set to 190 °C so the temperature would drop to 140 °C when
the sublimation apparatus was placed in the heating mantle. Method
4 adds an additional step to Method 1, similar to the procedure proposed
by Goodwin et al., in which the samples were exposed to a saturated
moist atmosphere after sublimation.31 After
the matrix sublimation was complete, the glass slide was placed in
a humidity chamber with deionized water for approximately 45 min and
allowed to dry at room temperature before MSI. It was observed that
the methods that gradually raised the temperature from RT gave more
even coverage of matrix and performed more consistently between runs.
In this comparison, analyte signal was distinguished from matrix signal
using the MS images as guides. MS images were extracted by manually
clicking on each peak in the spectrum. Peaks corresponding to images
where no signal was seen in the matrix-only area and signal was present
on the M. truncatula tissue were considered metabolites.
Significantly more metabolite peaks were observed using gradual heating
with the humidity chamber step (Method 4), in comparison with gradual
heating and no humidity (Method 1), especially in the higher mass
region (above m/z 500). SI Figure
6, Supporting Information, shows several
representative MS images comparing gradual heating sublimation methods
without and with humidity (Methods 1 and 4 respectively), illustrating
that gradual heating without humidity produced less analyte diffusion
than gradual heating with humidity in the lower mass range, while
gradual heating with humidity enhanced metabolite detection in the
higher mass range. SI Figure 6, Supporting Information, also compares the MS spectra from these methods, showing the increased
detection of higher m/z metabolites
when the humidity step was employed.

For CHCA, five gradual
heating methods were examined that involved beginning at RT and gradually
increasing the temperature to 120, 140, 150, 152, or 160 °C over
the course of 10 min. Heating to 152 °C provided homogeneous
coverage and good signal intensity, to 160 °C generated too thick
of a layer of CHCA, and to 150 °C resulted in slightly too thin
of a layer to give consistent results. A sixth method was examined
in which the sublimation chamber was gradually heated to 152 °C
over 10 min, followed by 45 min in the humidity chamber as described
above. A summary of the parameters used for each of the four methods
is listed in SI Table 3, Supporting Information. Unlike the results described above, adding the humidity chamber
step did not increase the metabolite detection and only served to
diffuse analytes in the lower mass region.

Automatic Sprayer Matrix
Application
For DHB, five
automatic sprayer matrix application methods were developed for the
automatic TM-Sprayer system. The parameters used for each of the five
methods are summarized in SI Table 4, Supporting
Information; 3 mm line spacing and a nozzle temperature of
80 °C was used for all methods. The first method (Method 1) was
recommended by the manufacturer of the automatic sprayer system method
for detecting metabolites. The solvent flow rate and spray nozzle
velocity were changed in the different methods to produce a drier
spray. As the solvent flow rate decreases, the spray becomes drier
because less solvent is being sprayed onto the sample. Increasing
the velocity of the spray nozzle also produces a drier spray because
the nozzle is spraying matrix over the sample for a shorter period
of time. Method 4, listed in the table, is the driest, most sublimation-like
spray because it has the highest nozzle velocity and the lowest solvent
flow rate. Changing the number of passes allows for adjustment of
the matrix density to provide suitable MS signal. All methods performed
with the automatic sprayer system provide excellent reproducibility
and consistency in crystal size and coverage. The number of metabolites
detected and the extent of analyte diffusion, visualized with MSI,
was compared between all five methods; representative MS images comparing
3 of the sprayer methods are shown in SI Figure 7, Supporting Information. The “driest method”
(Method 4) allowed for the detection of nearly double the number of
metabolites when compared to the other four methods examined. The
use of Method 4 allowed for detection of metabolites over the entire
mass range suggesting that the method was dry enough to detect metabolites
in the low mass region without causing them to diffuse and dilute
but had enough solvent to extract higher mass metabolites from the
tissue for detection.

For CHCA, six automatic sprayer matrix
application methods were developed for the automatic TM-Sprayer system.
The parameters used for each of the six methods are summarized in
SI Table 5, Supporting Information; a nozzle
temperature of 80 °C was used for all methods. All automatic
sprayer methods performed equivalently with regards to metabolite
detection and little analyte diffusion; therefore, the optimized method
is the method suggested by the manufacturer because it requires the
least amount of time for application. Using 10 mg/mL CHCA may require
extra cleaning of the sprayer apparatus depending on the quality of
the syringe pump used in the setup; we recommend using 5 mg/mL CHCA
and doubling the number of passes to achieve equivalent results without
the chance of clogging the sprayer.

Comparison of Optimized
Airbrush, Sublimation, and Automatic
Sprayer Methods
The optimized sublimation and automatic sprayer
methods were directly compared to the standard, well-used airbrush
matrix application method by performing MSI on serial sections of M. truncatula root nodule tissue, for both DHB and CHCA.
When applying matrix with these three very different techniques and
performing MSI of samples coated using the different application methods
in a single run, the overall signal and metabolite detection decreased
significantly when compared to results from performing MSI of the
techniques individually. One reason for this could be due to the varying
crystal size in a single experiment, which causes limited detection
in TOF/TOF mass analyzers. Even with the decreased metabolite detection,
it is still clear that the optimized automatic sprayer method facilitates
the detection of the highest number of metabolites. Figure 1 shows optical images comparing matrix coverage
and crystal size for the airbrush, optimized automatic sprayer, and
optimized sublimation matrix application methods respectively for
(a) DHB and (b) CHCA. Sublimation produces one even layer of matrix;
the automatic sprayer produces very small, uniform crystals, while
the airbrush produces larger crystals of varying sizes. Figure 2 compares MS profiling spectra for pure matrix using
the airbrush (blue), optimized automatic sprayer (red), and optimized
sublimation (green) matrix application methods for (a) DHB and (b)
CHCA. For both matrices, the matrix signal is highest in the airbrush
spectrum and there are more matrix ion peaks than the other two methods,
which could cause interference with some of the metabolites of interest.
All three matrix application techniques produce slightly different
matrix ion peak patterns; the automatic sprayer and sublimation techniques
could be complementary ways to detect low molecular weight metabolites
that are masked by high intensity matrix peaks. Figures 3 and 4 show comparisons of representative
MS images of M. truncatula root nodules using the
airbrush, automatic sprayer, and sublimation methods optimized for
DHB and CHCA, respectively. Compared to the airbrush method, the sublimation
and automatic sprayer methods show less analyte diffusion and a greater
number of metabolites detected. For DHB, the sublimation method shows
some analyte diffusion in the lower mass range due to the humidity
chamber step, but there are also some metabolites detected in the
higher mass range that would not have been detected without the humidity
chamber step.

Conclusions
Monitoring
metabolite distribution is extremely important for the
overall understanding of molecular pathways in many biological systems
and fields of study. This work presents a comprehensive evaluation
of three major MALDI matrix application techniques with the two most
widely used matrices (DHB and CHCA) for MS imaging of small molecules.
The use of the optimized automatic sprayer methods significantly increases
the number of metabolites detected within a defined mass range, especially
when using DHB. The ability of the automatic sprayer to enhance metabolite
detection while maintaining the spatial distribution of small molecules
within a biological tissue sample, when compared to airbrush and sublimation
matrix application methods, was demonstrated by acquiring positive
ion images from serial tissue sections of M. truncatula. The optimized automatic sprayer method and sublimation methods
reduce analyte diffusion that is typically seen with traditional airbrush
matrix application methods.

The combined use of solvent-free
(sublimation) and solvent-based
(automatic sprayer) matrix application techniques can provide complementary
matrix peak profile results, providing the possibility to detect metabolites
that were masked by interfering matrix ion peaks in one matrix application
method but not masked in the other. There were very few metabolites
that were only detected with the sublimation or airbrush methods;
therefore, the optimized automatic sprayer method is recommended for
detection of the greatest number of metabolites during a single experiment.

Strict optimization of matrix application technique seems to be
more critical when working with DHB. The procedure for applying DHB
with the automatic sprayer or via sublimation was extremely critical
to the quality of the MS images, whereas similar results were obtained
using CHCA regardless of the procedure used to apply the matrix.

Using the optimized sprayer methods to apply DHB and CHCA, respectively,
on serial sections of plant root nodule tissue provided complementary
detection of endogenous metabolites. Over 100 compounds were detected
using each matrix with approximately 60% of the detected metabolites
uniquely detected using either DHB or CHCA and approximately 40% overlap
between methods. Future work using alternative matrices in both positive
and negative ionization modes to test the ability of the optimized
automatic sprayer method compared to the optimized sublimation method
would further characterize the advantages of using one method over
the other or a combination of both automatic sprayer and sublimation
matrix application techniques.
