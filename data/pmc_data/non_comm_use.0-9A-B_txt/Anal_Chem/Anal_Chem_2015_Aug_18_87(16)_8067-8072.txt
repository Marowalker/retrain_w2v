A novel
electrochemically controlled release method for nitric
oxide (NO) (based on electrochemical reduction of nitrite ions) is
combined with an amperometric oxygen sensor within a dual lumen catheter
configuration for the continuous in vivo sensing
of the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) in blood. The on-demand electrochemical NO generation/release method
is shown to be fully compatible with amperometric PO2 sensing. The performance of the sensors is evaluated
in rabbit veins and pig arteries for 7 and 21 h, respectively. Overall,
the NO releasing sensors measure both venous and arterial PO2 values more accurately with an average deviation
of −2 ± 11% and good correlation (R2 = 0.97) with in vitro blood measurements,
whereas the corresponding control sensors without NO release show
an average deviation of −31 ± 28% and poor correlation
(R2 = 0.43) at time points >4 h after
implantation in veins and >6 h in arteries. The NO releasing sensors
induce less thrombus formation on the catheter surface in both veins
and arteries (p < 0.05). This electrochemical
NO generation/release method could offer a new and attractive means
to improve the biocompatibility and performance of implantable chemical
sensors.

==== Body
Levels of chemical species in
blood, including blood gases (pH, partial pressure of O2 (PO2), partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2)), electrolytes (Na+, K+, Ca2+), glucose, and lactate, provide
invaluable information for the diagnosis and treatment of hospitalized
patients.1,2 Currently, these analytes are intermittently
measured in vitro with point-of-care devices using
blood samples, which provides only periodic information, leaving large
gaps in time between blood draws. Continuous monitoring of these species
directly within blood vessels would greatly improve the quality of
health care for critically ill patients.3,4 Indeed, the
development of intravascular devices that can monitor key physiological
species in real-time is the “holey grail” in the field
of chemical sensors. Despite extensive efforts over several decades,
there are currently no sensing devices available that can achieve
this goal, mostly due to poor biocompatibility of the devices once
placed intravascularly (IV) within flowing blood.5−7 One major complication
is the formation of clots/thrombus, which occurs within hours after
blood contact.8 The thrombus can isolate
the sensors from the bulk of the blood and cause unreliable analytical
results.9 Intravascular thrombus formation
also has the intrinsic risk to embolize and affect vital organs in
the patient.10

In the blood vessels,
healthy endothelial cells generate nitric
oxide (NO) at the flux from (0.5–4.0) × 10–10 mol·cm–2·min–1, and
one of the functions of NO is to inhibit platelet activation/aggregation
and prevent clotting at the surface of the endothelial cell layer.11−13 Inspired by this knowledge, NO release/generation strategies have
been adopted for the development of more biocompatible IV devices,
including electrochemical sensors.14−19 The traditional NO releasing sensors rely on coatings on the surface
of the devices that contain NO donors (either by entrapping or covalent
attachment) that decompose and generate NO spontaneously both in vivo and under storage in buffer solution.20,21 Such passive NO release strategies are expensive and have shelf
life issues due to the instability of many NO donors utilized to date.
Further, there are concerns about leaching of NO donors and/or byproducts
into the bloodstream. These issues have impeded their adaptation into
clinical settings. Strategies based on NO generation from endogenous S-nitrosothiol (RSNO) species using immobilized catalysts
on the surface of the sensors have also been pursued.15 However, the levels of endogenous RSNOs are likely too
variable from patient to patient to guarantee that enough surface
NO can be generated to prevent platelet adhesion and clotting for
each and every patient.

Recently, a completely new electrochemical
method has been reported
to produce very controllable NO generation by electrochemical reduction
of inorganic nitrite ions catalyzed by a copper(II)-ligand complex.22 Not only can the NO generation/release be actively
controlled “on” and “off”, but also the
flux of the NO release from the device surface can be readily modulated
within the physiologically relevant range, by applying different voltages
to an inner working wire electrode. This “on-demand”
NO release method is highly desirable for implantable sensors for
several reasons, including: (1) during the storage, the NO release
can be turned “off” and thus the reservoir of NO precursor
is preserved; (2) sodium nitrite as the NO donor is very stable and
inexpensive compared to NO donors like diazeniumdiolates and S-nitrosothiols; and (3) the levels of NO release can be
modulated in vivo, with low levels for most of the
time to prevent clotting and higher levels turned on only periodically
to better prevent/manage risk of infection.

In this study, we
investigate, for the first time, the concept
of combining electrochemical NO generation/release with intravascular
chemical sensors to improve their in vivo analytical
performance. Specifically, a dual lumen catheter-type amperometric PO2 sensor (i.e., one lumen dedicated to electrochemical
NO generation and the second lumen used for PO2 sensing) is developed to demonstrate this concept. Such devices
can be fabricated conveniently using commercial dual lumen silicone
rubber catheter tubing without any NO releasing/generating coating.
The performance of these sensors is further evaluated in rabbit and
pig models for up to 21 h, both in veins and arteries. The sensors
were exposed to a wide range of PO2in vivo from ∼20 to ∼480 mmHg, by changing
ventilator levels of the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2).

Experimental Section
Reagents and Instrumentation
Sodium
nitrite, copper
acetate, tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate,
sodium carbonate, potassium chloride, and HEPES buffer were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Teflon PFA-coated silver (0.127
mm OD) and platinum wires (0.125 mm OD) are products of A-M Systems
(Sequim, WA). All solutions were prepared with Milli-Q water (Millipore
Corp., Billerica, MA). Dual-lumen silicone catheters (7 Fr) were gifted
from Cook Medical Inc. (Bloomington, IN). Silicone rubber adhesive
(RTV-3140) was obtained from Dow Corning (Midland, MI). Tanks of gas
with varying levels of O2 balanced in N2 were
products from Cryogenic Gas Inc. (Detroit, MI).

All electrochemical
experiments were performed using CH Instruments multichannel potentiostats
(1000C, Austin, TX) and/or a BioStat potentiostat (ESA Biosciences
Inc., Chelmsford, MA). Nitric oxide release from the catheters was
measured using a Sievers Nitric Oxide Analyzer (GE Instruments, Boulder,
CO). Blood gas values from blood samples drawn from the test animals
were measured using a 700 series blood gas analyzer (Radiometer America
Inc., Brea, CA).

Fabrication of Catheter-Type Electrochemical
NO Releasing PO2 Sensors
The
procedures used were
modified from those reported previously.22,23 A long dual lumen catheter (see dimensions in Figure 1) was cut to 7 cm in length, and both lumens
were sealed at one end with silicone rubber adhesive. The larger lumen
was filled with a solution containing 4 mM CuTPMA, 0.4 M NaNO2, 0.2 M NaCl, and 0.5 M HEPES (pH 7.2). A Teflon PFA-coated
Pt wire (3 cm exposed) and a Ag/AgCl wire (5 cm exposed) were inserted
into the lumen as working and reference electrodes, respectively.
The smaller lumen was filled with 0.15 M KCl in 0.1 M bicarbonate/carbonate
buffer (pH 10), and a PFA-coated Pt wire (only tip exposed) as well
as a Ag/AgCl wire (3 cm exposed) were inserted for oxygen sensing.
The openings of the lumens at the proximal end were then sealed (around
the wires) with silicone rubber adhesives and left cured in water
overnight.

PO2 Sensor Calibration
Catheter
sensors were immersed in PBS buffer bubbled with different
levels of O2 (0%, 10%, 21%, 100%) at the flow rate of ∼500
mL/min. The PO2 sensing lumen of the catheter
was polarized at −700 mV in PBS buffer with 0% O2 for 1 h before calibration. At each level of PO2, NO release was switched either from “on” to
“off” or from “off” to “on”,
by applying −400 mV between the working and reference electrodes
within the NO generating lumen. Note that the two lumens are separate
electrochemical cells and the lead wires from each lumen are connected
to different channels of a multichannel potentiostat. To determine
response times, the sensors were switched between solutions presaturated
with 0% and 21% O2. The response time corresponds to the
time needed to reach 90% of the steady-state current response after
changing the oxygen level.

In Vivo Experiments
The procedures
used were in compliance with the University Committee on the Use and
Care of Animals as well as federal regulations and were reported elsewhere.15 Briefly, New Zealand white rabbits (∼3
kg, n = 5) were placed under anesthesia for the 7
h experiments. Two catheter-type PO2 sensors
were placed in the jugular veins and connected to potentiostats with
NO release lumen switched “on” for one of the sensors.
No other anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents were administrated to
the rabbits during the experiments. The initial fraction of inspired
oxygen (FiO2) was 100%. During the latter part of the experiment,
the FiO2 level was changed to 21% for ∼1 h and then
switched back to 100%. Venous blood was drawn every 30 min to test
for PO2 values using the blood gas analyzer
as the reference method. To calibrate the sensors in vivo, the ex vivo data point at the 30 min time point
after implantation was used as a one-point calibration, with intercept
determined by a prior benchtop calibration of the oxygen sensing portion
of the catheter. The continuous signal from the sensors was compared
with the intermittent in vitro blood PO2 values. The sensors with the blood vessels intact were
explanted after systemic heparinization to prevent necrotic thrombosis
during vessel harvesting; digital pictures were taken, and the red
pixels were counted using ImageJ software to quantify clot area.23,24

Similar experiments were performed using a porcine model (∼50
kg, n = 4) for 21 h. The sensors were placed in the
femoral and carotid arteries via an open cut-down allowing for continuous
blood flow past the sensors. The FiO2 level was maintained
at 21% and changed periodically to 100% for a 1 h period (ca. every
6 h). Arterial blood was drawn every hour to assess the accuracy of
the PO2 values provided by the implanted
sensors. Similar to the experiments with rabbits, sensors and vessels
were explanted at the end of the experiments to allow for quantification
of clot burden.

Signal Processing and Statistics
The in vivo data from the sensors were recorded
every second and averaged every
30 s to reduce the electronic noise as well as the size of the data
set. A Student’s t test (two-tail, paired)
was used to evaluate the significance of the data sets. Linear regression
and R2 were used to evaluate the accuracy
and correlation, respectively.

Results and Discussion
Rationale
for Sensor Design
A commercial dual-lumen
silicone catheter (cross section geometry shown in Figure 1) was used to fabricate the
electrochemical NO releasing PO2 sensors.
Silicone rubber is preferred because it is highly permeable toward
both the analyte, O2, and the anticlotting agent, NO, while
impermeable toward the inner solutions of reservoir ions.22,25 One lumen of the catheter is dedicated to O2 sensing,
using the cross-section distal tip of a PFA-coated Pt wire working
electrode. It is held at a cathodic potential (−0.7 V vs Ag/AgCl)
where reduction of O2 occurs to yield a steady-state current
proportional to PO2 levels. The other
lumen is dedicated to NO generation/release and contains a reservoir
of sodium nitrite (0.4 M) and CuTPMA (4 mM) catalyst. Note that, although
the cross-section geometry of the dual lumen catheter is not symmetric,
it can be shown by finite element analysis (via Comsol Multiphysics
software) that the NO distribution is symmetrically enhanced around
the entire dual lumen catheter assembly because of the high diffusivity
and solubility of this neutral lipophilic gas molecule in the silicone
rubber (see Figure S1).

Sensor Performance
on the Benchtop
The first study
involved assessing the compatibility of the O2 sensing
with the electrochemical NO generation process. The design of the
sensor facilitates such investigation, since the two electrochemical
systems reside within the two separate lumens of the same catheter
device and the NO generation lumen can be easily turned “on”
and “off” by applying −0.4 V to the Pt working
electrode within that lumen. Thus, the exact same sensor can be studied
with and without NO release, merely by disconnecting the electrode
leads from the NO generating lumen to the potentiostat. The O2 sensing was found to be fully compatible with NO release,
as no noticeable amperometric signal changes were observed for the
O2 sensor when NO generation was switched “on”
or “off” at each O2 level during the calibration
(see Figure S2). This is expected as the
reaction between NO and O2 is second order with respect
to NO, implying that the reaction is slow when the concentration of
NO is low.26 This is true for the catheters
under investigation, as they generate a relatively low flux of NO,
∼1.5 × 10–10 mol·cm–2·min–1 (see below). The high solubility of
O2 in silicone rubber also sufficiently supplies O2 to the electrode surface even if a portion of the O2 does react with NO.

In benchtop studies, the sensors exhibited
stable amperometric calibrations during storage at 37 °C over
3 d with continuous NO generation/release (Figure S3). The response time of the PO2 sensors were ca. 7 min (Figure S4), primarily
determined by the dimensions (e.g., wall thickness) of the dual lumen
catheters employed in these studies. Although not ideal, this response
time is sufficient to be clinically useful, especially compared to
the current situation where PO2 can only
be measured ex vivo using samples of fresh blood.
The response time for standard Clark-type O2 sensor also
depends on the dimension of the sensor (membrane thickness, distance
between the electrode to the membrane, etc.), but since the membranes
can be very thin for ex vivo sensors, the response
times of these devices are generally 1 min or so. This is not possible
when the wall of the catheter is being used as the gas permeable membrane,
since wall thickness needs to be large enough to provide the catheter
mechanical strength to be placed within a blood vessel.

The
NO release of such devices was also examined. The sensing catheters
released NO, as measured by chemiluminescence measurements,27 at an average surface flux of >1.0 ×
10–10 mol·cm–2·min–1 (based on the area inserted in blood vessels) for
72 h, which is
more than sufficient for the short-term proof-of-concept studies reported
here (see Figure S5). The duration of the
NO release in these particular devices is mainly limited by the small
volume of the NO generation reservoir solution containing nitrite
ions (∼30 μL). The duration of NO generation/release
can be readily extended, if necessary, by increasing the volume or
concentration of nitrite within the reservoir. It has been shown that
devices that have a larger reservoir (using longer catheters) can
exhibit NO release at relevant fluxes for >7 d.22 This provides a simple solution for extending the NO release
duration since only a relatively small portion of the device needs
to reside within the blood vessels. The surface region of NO release
can be controlled by situating the active NO generating electrode
near the distal end where the catheter is implanted within the blood
vessel.22 Increasing the concentration
of nitrite in the reservoir without changing the volume, though effective
for longer-term NO release, is limited by the further increase in
osmotic pressure, which could potentially compromise the stability
of the device over longer-term use.

Sensor Performance in Vivo
The catheter-type PO2 sensors were first studied in rabbit veins
over a 7 h period. The sensors were purposely challenged with lower
venous PO2 levels during the latter period
of the experiment, by switching the FiO2 from 100% to 21%.
The NO releasing sensors measured the PO2 levels accurately and were able to follow both the decrease of PO2 at the ∼4 h time point and the recovery
of PO2 at the ∼5.5 h time point
(see Figure 2a as representative
example). In contrast, the signal from the control sensors started
to deviate negatively during the latter time period of the experiment,
and although the sensors responded to a decrease of PO2 at ca. the ∼4 h mark, the levels measured were
not accurate (negative deviation from in vitro blood-gas
instrument values) and the responses were not able to fully recover
when the PO2 is changed to the higher
level via increasing the FiO2 level. This was due to the
formation of the large blood clots on the control sensor (see Figure 2b, as an example).
Thrombus formation around the catheter surface can create a local
environment that has lower O2 level because of the consumption
of oxygen by platelets and other cells within the clot.9 Overall, the NO releasing sensors induced less
clot formation than the control sensors as measured by imaging the
surface of the catheters after explantation from the rabbit after
7 h (see Figure 2c
for data for n = 5 rabbits, p <
0.05).

Since the PO2 level is different
within each individual animal at different time points, the accuracy
of the sensors was evaluated by quantitating the deviations (Dev)
of the PO2 values provided by the sensors
vs those provided from the in vitro blood sample PO2 measurements at the same time point, assuming
the in vitro measured values are 100% accurate. The
deviation can be calculated as  where PO2 sensor is the measured PO2 from catheter-type
sensors and PO2 reference is the
measured PO2 from the blood gas analyzer
using the discrete blood samples. In general, the NO releasing sensors
showed deviations within ±15% and the differences are not significant
at each time point (p > 0.2, n =
5 rabbits, Figure 2d), while the control sensors exhibited significant negative deviations
at time points >4 h after they were implanted within veins (p < 0.05, n = 5 rabbits, Figure 2d). It should be noted that
venous PO2 values are typically much lower
and encompass a relatively narrow range (25–50 mmHg) compared
to arterial blood (see below for porcine experiments). Small changes
in the venous PO2 values provide information
about tissue perfusion.28 The effective
functionality of NO releasing PO2 catheter
sensors within veins has not been evaluated previously.

of electrochemical NO generating/releasing PO2 sensors implanted in rabbit veins for 7 h:
(a) representative sensor response for a NO releasing sensor (black)
and a control sensor (red) compared with blood draw in vitro test values (blue square); the FiO2 levels were changed

clot formation on the surface of the control and the NO releasing
sensors after being explanted; (c) average thrombus coverage percentage
on NO releasing sensors vs control sensors (n = 5
rabbits, p < 0.05); (d) average deviation of the
NO releasing sensors (black) and control sensors (red) from the reference

For testing the proposed sensors in vivo over
longer time periods and over a wider range of PO2 levels, the catheter sensors were further implanted within
pig arteries for 21 h. Again, the FiO2 was varied between
100% and 21% to challenge the sensors with different arterial PO2 levels in vivo. As in the
rabbit experiments, the sensors with electrochemical NO release followed
the changes in PO2 more accurately and
reversibly while the control sensors without NO generation turned
“on” start to exhibit negative deviations from in vitro measured PO2 levels
after 6 h (Figure 3a). Overall, the NO releasing sensors provided more reliable PO2 values for the entire 21 h in vivo experiments (n = 4 pigs, p >
0.1
at each time point) while the controls sensors, after 6 h of implantation,
showed a significant negative deviation of >20% at almost every
time
point (n = 4 pigs, p < 0.05 at
each time point except for the 16th h; see Figure 3b). Note that the ability to follow active
modulation of PO2 in both veins and arteries
were demonstrated for the first time for these new NO releasing PO2 sensors.

Figure 3 Performance of electrochemical NO generating/releasing PO2 sensors implanted in pig arteries for 21
h: (a) representative current response for a NO releasing sensor (black)
and a control sensor (red) compared with blood draw in vitro test values (reference method, blue square). Arrows indicate where
FiO2 changes from 21% to 100%; (b) average deviation of
the NO release sensors (black) and control sensors (red) from the
reference method (blue). Error bars indicate standard deviation.

The measurements from both rabbit
veins and pig arteries can also
be combined and compared with the reference method to assess their
overall analytical performance in vivo (see Figure 4). Data points after
the 4 h time point in the rabbits and after the 6 h time point in
pigs were included in the comparison, since it generally takes time
to observe the lowered analytical results for the control sensors
(accumulation of clots/thrombus takes time). The NO releasing sensors
exhibited good correlation (R2 = 0.97)
and accuracy for PO2 measurements with
an average deviation of −2 ± 11%, whereas the control
sensors yielded much poorer correlation (R2 = 0.43) and a deviation of −31 ± 28%. On the basis of
the periodic blood sample tests as reference method (n = 84), 96% of the measurements from NO generating/releasing sensors
were within ±20% error, while only 32% of the measurements from
control sensors were within ±20% error (Figure 4). Linear regression was performed on these
measurements to obtain slopes for the results from the electrochemical PO2 sensors vs those from the reference in vitro measurement method. The electrochemical NO releasing
sensors yielded a slope of 0.90 (not shown in Figure 4 for clarity), indicating good overall accuracy.
The control sensors, in contrast, exhibited a slope of 0.51, indicating
an overall 49% suppression of the signals. Again, this is most likely
due to thrombus formation and concomitant entrapped metabolically
active cells on the control catheters.

sensors in vivo vs the reference method from blood
samples. Data contain all the measurements >4 h time point in rabbit
experiments and >6 h time point in pig experiments. Black squares
represent results from the NO generating/releasing sensors. The red
triangles represent the measurements from the control sensors. Dash
lines and the solid line indicate ±20% error and 0% error, respectively.

Conclusions
Catheter-type
amperometric PO2 sensors
incorporating a novel electrochemical NO generating/release system
have been developed. These NO releasing sensors were implanted in
both veins and arteries of animal models for up to 21 h and yield
less clot formation and more accurate analytical results. This method
could provide a general strategy for improving the hemocompatibility
of a wide variety of blood contacting sensors/devices. Further, owing
to the potent antimicrobial properties of NO,29 such electrochemical NO generating devices could also greatly lower
the risk of infection, which is another major issue with intravascular
sensors and other devices, especially when the dwelling time is longer
than 24 h. We envision that a low level of NO can be used to prevent
clotting but can be increased for short periods (3 h per day etc.)
to better kill bacteria.21 This can be
readily achieved by the new electrochemical NO release system investigated
in this study. A longer-term (7 d) in vivo investigation
of the new IV-PO2 sensor design in freely
moving animals is currently being planned.
