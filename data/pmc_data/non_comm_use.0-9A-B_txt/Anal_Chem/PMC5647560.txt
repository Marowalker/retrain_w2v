Native electron capture
dissociation (NECD) is a process during
which proteins undergo fragmentation similar to that from radical
dissociation methods, but without the addition of exogenous electrons.
However, after three initial reports of NECD from the cytochrome c dimer complex, no further evidence of the effect has been
published. Here, we report NECD behavior from horse spleen ferritin,
a ∼490 kDa protein complex ∼20-fold larger than the
previously studied cytochrome c dimer. Application
of front-end infrared excitation (FIRE) in conjunction with low- and
high-m/z quadrupole isolation and
collisionally activated dissociation (CAD) provides new insights into
the NECD mechanism. Additionally, activation of the intact complex
in either the electrospray droplet or the gas phase produced c-type fragment ions. Similar to the previously reported
results on cytochrome c, these fragment ions form
near residues known to interact with iron atoms in solution. By mapping
the location of backbone cleavages associated with c-type ions onto
the crystal structure, we are able to characterize two distinct iron
binding channels that facilitate iron ion transport into the core
of the complex. The resulting pathways are in good agreement with
previously reported results for iron binding sites in mammalian ferritin.

==== Body
Interest
in native mass spectrometry
for characterization of biologically relevant macromolecular assemblies
has increased in recent years,1 with great
insights into composition and function provided for soluble2,3 and integral membrane complexes.4,5 Gas-phase fragmentation
of these complexes by electron-based and collision-based dissociation
techniques allows for unprecedented characterization of primary and
higher-order structures.6−10 Of these, native electron capture dissociation (NECD), first introduced
in 2003 by Breuker and McLafferty, proved both unexpected and useful
for the elucidation of the heme-binding and gas-phase unfolding of
the dimeric species of cytochrome c.(11,12) However, finding examples of this effect on other macromolecular
complexes has proven elusive, and the underlying mechanism has not
been investigated further.

NECD is a fragmentation process that
occurs during ion transfer
through a heated capillary in native electrospray ionization (nESI)
of an iron-containing protein complex. Covalent bond cleavage near
residues in contact with the heme results in apparent complementary c- and y-fragment ions.13 Changes in higher-order complex structure (e.g. unfolding) can perturb the heme-protein interactions, causing variation
in the formation of NECD products. By analyzing changes in these fragment
ion yields, it was possible to study the early gas-phase unfolding
of cytochrome c,(12) and
even the early partitioning of protons onto the dimer ions.14 Unfortunately, despite the promise of NECD as
a technique for protein characterization, no further studies of the
effect, either theoretical or experimental, have since been reported.

Here, we report the NECD phenomenon on the ∼490 kDa 24-mer
ferritin, a protein complex known to store up to 4,500 Fe atoms.15 Unlike the previously studied cytochrome c dimer, ferritin does not contain a covalently bound heme
group, instead using a di-iron site to catalytically convert soluble
Fe(II) to an inorganic mineral similar to ferrihydrate (composed of
Fe(III), oxygen, and small amounts of phosphate) which is stored in
the core of the protein complex.16−19 Iron ions are channeled through
subunit helices17 and protein nanocage
pores20,21 and stored in the central cavity for future
cellular use.22,23 Ferritin from mammalian tissues
is made up of different proportions of the L (liver)- and H (heart)-chain;
in horse they have masses of 19.9 and 21.2 kDa, respectively. The
H-chain provides catalytic activity, and the L-chain is implicated
in structural stability and cavity mineralization.24−26 The present
work analyzed horse spleen holo-ferritin, which is made up of ∼90%
L-chain.

Experimental Section
Apo- and holoferritin from horse
spleen and cytochrome c from horse heart (Sigma)
were desalted with 100 kDa and
10 kDa molecular weight cutoff filters, respectively, into 150 mM
ammonium acetate at slightly acidic pH (∼5.6–7.0). Samples
were diluted to a final concentration of 2 μM (ferritin) and
100 μM (cytochrome c) for the intact complex
and sprayed using a custom-built nanospray source as described previously.27,28

All mass spectrometry measurements were performed on a Q-Exactive
HF (Thermo Scientific) modified to allow for efficient transfer and
quadrupole isolation of ions up to ∼10,000 m/z.6 Spectra were acquired at a resolving power of
120,000 (at 200 m/z), with the exception
of the ferritin MS1, which was acquired at 7,500 resolving
power (at 200 m/z), and smoothed
for more accurate mass determination. The mass error presented here
represents the standard deviation of the masses determined from the
apex of each charge state peak in a single spectrum and, therefore,
indicates the maximum precision of the measurement. NECD fragment
ions from ferritin were collected as two separate spectra, one at
higher energy in the collision cell for fragments from sites 6–79,
and one at lower energy for fragments from sites 114–130. Data
analysis was performed with Xtract (Thermo Scientific) or mMass29 software, and graphical fragment maps were created
with Prosight Lite.30 All intensity values
used for the determination of weighted-average charges were normalized
by charge to account for the detection bias in the Orbitrap mass analyzer.

Front-end infrared excitation (FIRE) experiments used a 20 W continuous-wave
CO2 laser (Synrad Firestar V20). The laser was attenuated
with a 1.0 optical density (O.D.) nickel-coated zinc selenide neutral
density filter and then aligned unfocused to the inlet capillary with
protected gold mirrors. An average power of 1.2 W was used for FIRE
experiments.

Safety Considerations
Vigilance and proper protective
equipment should be used when handling ferritin, cytochrome c, and any other sample. Additionally, the high-voltage
in the electrospray source can cause dangerous electrical shocks when
not properly shielded. Finally, proper eye protection should be worn
when using a CO2 or any other laser, especially as pointing
it at the highly reflective front end of an instrument may cause unpredictable
scattering.

Results and Discussion
Horse spleen
ferritin was desalted and characterized by native
top down mass spectrometry (nTDMS)6,31 (Figure 1). The MS1 spectrum (Figure 1a) indicated the presence of the intact complex with a mass of 490,380
± 59 Da, consistent with the L22H2 complex
and a ∼9500 Da iron oxide mineral. Broad spectral peaks (full
width at half max of ∼3000 Da) were likely caused by hetereogeneity
in the core mass but may also indicate small molecule adduction common
with native MS.32 Collisional activation
in the electrospray source produced peaks at lower m/z (Figure 1b, isotopically resolved) corresponding in mass to the ejected
ferritin L-chain, with the previously reported31 cysteine methyl-disulfide modification at near complete
stoichiometry. The observed signal is at a much (∼6-fold) higher
charge state than would be predicted from a symmetric charge partitioning
during monomer ejection, indicating that it undergoes asymmetric charge
partitioning.33,34

Figure 1 Analysis of ferritin by native top-down
mass spectrometry. The
MS1 spectrum (a) exhibits broad peaks corresponding to
the mass of the intact 24-mer. After gas-phase activation in the source
region, the intact L-chain is ejected along with c-fragment ions (MS2, b). Mapping the fragment ions onto
the protein sequence (c) shows peptide bond cleavage at 37 unique
sites, with cleavages from sites 5–79 determined using higher-energy
collisions in the HCD cell, and those from sites >113 determined
using
lower-energy collisions. The red box on the N-terminus corresponds
to an acetylation, and the orange box to a cysteine methyl disulfide
modification.

In addition to ejected
monomer, several fragment ions were observed
and clearly resolved in the MS2 spectrum (Figure 1b, inset). Closer examination
of these species revealed that they did not correspond to the traditional b- and y-fragments generated from threshold
dissociation,35 but were instead consistent
with the mass of c-fragment ions. In conjunction
with fragment ions observed from a spectrum acquired at higher collision
energy, products from cleaving 37 L-chain backbone sites were characterized
(Figure 1c, matching
fragment masses for this and other fragment maps are listed in Table
S-1, Supporting Information). On the other
hand, isolation and collisional fragmentation of a single charge state
of the ejected monomer produced only b- and y-fragments (Figure S-1, Supporting
Information). No evidence for the intact or fragmented H-chain
was observed.

The observation of c-type fragment
ions is characteristic
of radical fragmentation processes such as electron capture or electron
transfer dissociation (ETD).36,37 However, here no exogenous
electrons were added or transferred. Instead, the formation of these
product ions recalls the heme-mediated intramolecular electron transfer
and fragmentation of NECD.11,12,14 Unlike the original reports of NECD on the cytochrome c dimer, the ∼20-fold larger ferritin complex does not contain
a heme group, and no complementary y-fragment ions
were observed. Therefore, in order to confirm that the c-type cleavage products were from NECD, it was necessary to better
characterize the mechanism driving fragment ion formation in ferritin.

First, we confirmed the identity of the observed c-fragments by quadrupole-isolating and using collisionally activated
dissociation (CAD) to characterize the 5+ charge state of c44, the most abundant NECD product (Figure 2). CAD produced b- and y-fragments originating from 50%
of all peptide bonds present in the c44 precursor, including seven y-fragments corresponding
(<5 ppm) to the mass of the sequence with a C-terminal amide. The y-fragments in this MS3 experiment contain the
mass of the “ragged end” of the original NECD cleavage,
which is characteristic of a c-fragment. Other NECD
fragments were insufficiently abundant to perform a similar characterization,
but were consistent in mass with c-fragments. Thus,
we were able to exclude other potential factors (e.g., unexpected
adducts and modifications) that may have confounded the mass values
and confirm the presence of c-fragments in the spectrum
with high confidence.

Figure 2 Isolation and CAD fragments provide unambiguous characterization
of the NECD-produced c44 5+ fragment ion.
The C-terminal amide corresponds to the “ragged end”
of the original NECD cleavage (after tautomerization), which is characteristic
of a c-fragment ion and not hydrolysis.

However, while NECD products from cytochrome c were shown to form primarily in the source region of the
instrument,11 the location where NECD of
ferritin occurs remained
more ambiguous. Isolation and collisional activation of the intact
ferritin complex gave clear evidence of NECD (Figure S-2, Supporting Information), albeit at a lower efficiency.
This is in contrast with isolation and fragmentation of the ejected
monomer (Figure S-1, Supporting Information), which produced no c-fragments. Therefore, both
cytochrome c and ferritin require the intact complex
to fragment. However, unlike cytochrome c, ferritin
can evidently form NECD fragments in the gas phase, after quadrupole
isolation. The apparent discrepancy between NECD of these two systems
could be due to significant water solvation of the ferritin ions even
after transfer to the gas phase. Additionally, it is possible that
fragment ions are being formed in the source region but are only separated
after activation in the gas phase.38

In order to examine whether ferritin NECD fragmentation can also
occur in the source region, we used a 20 W CO2 continuous-wave
laser aligned with the inlet capillary of the mass spectrometer in
a method termed front-end infrared excitation (FIRE) (experimental
setup, Figure S-3, Supporting Information). In order to better characterize the effects of FIRE, we used a
100 μM solution of cytochrome c, as its NECD
behavior has been extensively characterized previously.11,12,14 Application of FIRE produced
NECD (both c- and y-fragments) of
cytochrome c dimer species at inlet capillary temperatures
low enough not to produce any fragment ions without laser irradiation
(Figure S-4, Supporting Information). Using
the high precision afforded by varying the distance between the ESI
tip and inlet in the FIRE experiment, we correlated the relative signal
of the major NECD peak (y555+) with the distance between the laser and nESI spray tip (Figure
S-5, Supporting Information). The intensity
dropped drastically between 2 mm and 3 mm, indicating that FIRE has
little effect on nESI droplets after they have been sufficiently desolvated.
Misalignment of the laser so that it only irradiated the droplet pathway
between the nESI tip and the inlet capillary also drove NECD (Figure
S-6, Supporting Information), providing
further evidence that FIRE affects the droplets most just after they
leave the nESI nozzle. Because application of FIRE to ferritin also
produced NECD fragments (Figure S-7, Supporting
Information), we can conclude that this process occurs in the
nESI droplet as well.

As reported previously for NECD14 and
ETD39 fragments of cytochrome c dimer, ferritin c-fragments also undergo asymmetric
charge partitioning, as is evident from the great decrease in m/z between the precursor and its product
ions (from >8000 to 1000–2000, respectively, Figure 1a,b). Plotting the average
charge of each NECD fragment with respect to cleavage site indicates
a relatively high level of charge density in the fragment ions, with
discrete steps corresponding to the locations of arginines (Figure 3a); residues known
to be charged in nESI.40 In comparison,
CAD fragments from the isolated 14+ ejected monomer (overall weighted-average
charge of ejected monomers = 13.93) exhibited a similar distribution
of charge states also repeating the discrete jumps in charge at arginines
18, 26, and 39 (Figure 3a). The overall similarity in charge between the NECD and CAD fragments
indicates that the protons have partitioned to analogous locations
after the fragments have been ejected from the intact complex.

Figure 3 Charge distribution
observed in ferritin fragment ions. (a) The
observed charge states of c-type fragment ions from
NECD fragmentation of the intact complex and the b- and y-type fragments from CAD of the 14+ ejected
monomer exhibit many of the same discrete steps. In order to plot
them on the same axis as the N-terminal fragments, the charge of y-fragments is displayed as the difference 14–observed
charge. The locations of the 11 arginine residues in ferritin are
marked, as they often correlate with increases in charge. (b) The
asymmetric charge partitioning factor (ACPF) is displayed for each
of the observed NECD fragments with two or more charges. While there
is no noticeable change in the ACPF for larger fragment ions, all
but two partition more asymmetrically than the ejected monomer (dotted
line at ACPF = 6.1).

While the overall charge state of a fragment is a good measure
of charge density, we use the asymmetric charge partitioning factor
(ACPF) to determine the full magnitude of charge partitioning for
products of different mass.39 The ACPF
indicates the fold change between how much charge an ejected subunit
has when compared to how much it would have upon symmetric charge
partitioning. Thus, a symmetric charge partitioning would correspond
to an ACPF of 1, whereas higher values indicate an increasing magnitude
of the effect. Plotting the ACPF values of observed NECD fragments
(with two or more charges) with respect to their cleavage sites shows
that the magnitude of asymmetric charge partitioning remained relatively
constant with respect to fragment size (Figure 3b). Surprisingly, only two fragments partitioned
less than the ejected monomer (ACPF = 6.1); the overall average ACPF
was 7.2. Therefore, the NECD fragments are not only undergoing asymmetric
charge partitioning but are doing it more so than even the ejected
monomer.

The c-fragments observed from ferritin
have many
of the same characteristics as those found previously for NECD from
cytochrome c. Therefore, because previous work on
NECD has shown that fragment formation only occurs near residues that
interact with the iron-bearing heme group, the location of fragments
in ferritin too should be dependent on iron-side chain interactions.
However, cleavages occur between two residues, so any given cleavage
site could indicate up to two individual iron-binding interactions.
The assignment of residues to cleavage sites can be simplified because
not all amino acids are likely to coordinate to iron and were therefore
excluded from assignment.

Plotting the yields of c-fragment ions with respect
to their location on the protein sequence (Figure 4a) exhibits two regions of major fragmentation:
sites 34–49 and 117–130. High-intensity fragmentation
from these regions strongly indicates iron-binding interactions. The
first, 34–49, corresponds to a loop-pocket region (Figure 4b), which is a cavity
in the protein cage hypothesized to be involved in the release of
iron atoms into the cell.19,41 The second, located
on a 3-fold axis in the cage structure (Figure 4c) has been implicated in the uptake of soluble
Fe2+ prior to deposition in the inner iron core.19,41 Previous studies to characterize these regions have relied on overexpressed
systems and alternate metals; NECD directly mapped iron interactions
on a mammalian system from small amounts of an endogenous sample.

Figure 4 Yields
of c-type fragment ions plotted with respect
to their cleavage site (a) with the X-ray crystal structure of ferritin
(PDB: 1IER)
comprised of all L-subunits (shown in different colors). Mapping the
major fragment ions from NECD onto the crystal structure for sites
43–53 (b) indicates that the cleavages are centered in the
helix-loop region. Fragment ions from sites 114–130 (c) instead
indicate cleavages from the 3-fold axis pore.

Surprisingly, little fragmentation was observed around the
catalytically
active residues 53–63 and 135–140. However, only the
H-chain is considered catalytically active.25 Thus, NECD fragments, which are observed exclusively from the L-chain,
cannot be directly correlated to di-iron site oxidation of soluble
Fe2+. Additionally, activation of apoferritin from horse
spleen, which should contain no iron oxide mineral, produced many
similar c-fragments (Figure S-8), suggesting that the effect cannot be attributed to the core. However,
a recent study by Carmona et al. has shown that the light chain of
horse ferritin is critical for the transfer of an electron across
the boundary of the ferritin cage.42 The
apparent dependence of ferritin NECD on electron transfer brings it
in line with the electron-transport protein cytochrome c and could explain why NECD is not observed from other systems.

Despite the strong correlation between ferritin NECD fragment ions
and iron-binding channels, how the iron ions can generate radical-type
fragment ions is not completely clear. However, with the improved
fragment ion characterization presented here we propose a potential
mechanism for NECD in ferritin. In the first step, a subunit partially
unfolds, driving a similar proton transfer process to that predicted
for monomer ejection.43,44 This step explains the “stepped”
appearance of charge distribution in NECD fragment ions (Figure 3a), as the protons
are no longer mobilized and have already been distributed prior to
cleavage. While most of the subunit monomer has unfolded, the stronger
iron-mediated protein–protein interactions are maintained.
With increasing energy, these interactions are finally broken, transferring
an electron from complexed iron and cleaving the monomer’s
peptide bond.

Conclusions
Native electron capture
dissociation displayed promise as a new
technique for elucidating iron binding interactions when it was first
presented in 2003. However, no examples beyond the original cytochrome c dimer have since been described.11,12,14 Here, we demonstrate a second system displaying
the NECD phenomenon, the ∼490 kDa protein complex ferritin.
Leveraging information from FIRE-assisted dissociation and gas-phase
isolation/dissociation, we show that the resulting fragments are predominantly
NECD type c-ions, undergo asymmetric charge partitioning,
and can be formed in the electrospray droplet or in the gas phase
upon collisional or infrared activation. The formation of NECD products,
postulated here to be liberated from previously unfolded monomers,
could be further probed with future experiments using electron capture
dissociation, which has been used to monitor structural changes in
other gaseous protein complexes like the hemoglobin tetramer.45

When mapped on the crystal structure of
the all L-chain ferritin,
prevalent NECD fragments indicated significant iron binding at the
loop-pocket and 3-fold axis regions. These residues are not implicated
in the catalytic process of ferritin but instead correspond to channels
which mediate iron ion transport into the protein cage. Future applications
of NECD could therefore probe the migration of iron and potentially
other metals through the ferritin iron-binding channels and would
require orders-of-magnitude less sample than crystallography experiments.
While the applicability of NECD remains limited to two protein complexes,
its readout of iron-binding channels provides a high potential for
the targeted analysis of perturbations in these and potentially other
systems.
