Phage
display (PD) is frequently used to discover peptides capable
of binding to biological protein targets. The structural characterization
of peptide–protein complexes is often challenging due to their
low binding affinities and high structural flexibility. Here, we investigate
the use of hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS)
to characterize interactions of low affinity peptides with their cognate
protein targets. The HDX-MS workflow was optimized to accurately detect
low-affinity peptide–protein interactions by use of ion mobility,
electron transfer dissociation, nonbinding control peptides, and statistical
analysis of replicate data. We show that HDX-MS can identify regions
in the two epigenetic regulator proteins KDM4C and KDM1A that are
perturbed through weak interactions with PD-identified peptides. Two
peptides cause reduced HDX on opposite sides of the active site of
KDM4C, indicating distinct binding modes. In contrast, the perturbation
site of another PD-selected peptide inhibiting the function of KDM1A
maps to a GST-tag. Our results demonstrate that HDX-MS can validate
and map weak peptide–protein interactions and pave the way
for understanding and optimizing the binding of peptide scaffolds
identified through PD and similar ligand discovery approaches.

==== Body
An estimated
40% of current
pharmaceutical research focuses on the development of protein and
peptide-based drugs.1 Phage display (PD)
allows the easy and rapid discovery of protein and peptide binders
to biological targets that may be developed into drugs. Through sequential
enrichment of large DNA-encoded phage libraries, the proverbial “needle-in-the-haystack”
interacting with a given target can be identified.2 Peptides identified by PD often bind to biologically important
sites of the protein, such as the active site of an enzyme, and are
hence good drug candidates. Beyond competitive inhibition via active
site interactions, the sequence and/or tertiary structure of the selected
peptides can also behave as allosteric modulators of the target protein.
These allosteric modulator peptides sometimes mimic natural allosteric
binding proteins, exemplifying a phenomenon known as “convergent
evolution”.3

Unfortunately,
many hits from PD screening do not show satisfactory
affinity in vitro, though it has been estimated that
PD selected peptides must bind to their protein target with a dissociation
constant of 50 μM or lower in order to endure the vigorous washing
steps during biopanning.4 The reduced affinity
of the synthetic peptide versus the corresponding phage can be due
to the loss of multivalency. The commonly employed M13 phage displays
peptides via its pIII coat protein in 3–5 copies,5 and the possibility that the peptide–protein
interaction is driven not only by the monomeric peptide sequence but
also by its multimeric presentation on the phage has been discussed
extensively.6 Indeed, a recent study showed
that the tetrameric presentation of a PD selected peptide exhibited
45-fold higher binding affinity toward the target when compared to
the monomeric peptide.7

As peptides
encoded by phage libraries are normally 10–20
amino acids long, they usually do not adopt a stable secondary structure
in solution but are conformationally mobile.8 Due to their high structural flexibility, it is often challenging
to identify peptide binding epitopes on proteins by conventional X-ray
crystallography. In addition, the weak binding constants of phage
display derived peptide ligands to their target proteins require a
large excess of the weak binding peptide ligands which might interfere
with crystal formation.9 While the advantages
and information content of X-ray crystallography are undisputed, new
analytical tools are needed to dissect the binding mode of weak binding
and structurally flexible peptides and to identify false-positive
hits from high-throughput screenings originating, e.g., from binding
artifacts and nonspecific interactions. Furthermore, perturbations
in protein dynamics upon peptide binding are not readily detected
due to the rigidity of crystal structures.

The hydrogen/deuterium
exchange (HDX) of proteins provides a sensitive
window into the molecular interactions and dynamics of proteins in
solution. Coupling of HDX with mass spectrometric detection (MS) has
within recent years evolved to be a popular choice to study protein–protein
interactions and transient protein folding states.10,11 Through HDX-MS, the exchange of backbone amide hydrogens for deuteriums
can be localized to different regions of a protein by pepsin proteolysis
of the deuterium labeled protein. Perturbations to the conformation
of a protein upon peptide binding, through either direct interaction
or indirect changes in dynamics, can be detected by HDX-MS. A “perturbation
site” typically manifests itself by localized reductions in
deuterium uptake between the ligand-bound and the ligand-unbound protein.

Here, we describe and exemplify the tailoring of HDX-MS methodology
to detect and map the perturbation sites of low affinity peptide ligands
on target proteins in solution. HDX-MS is used to validate hits from
phage display screening and detect and map the low affinity interaction
of three inhibitory peptides (Peptides 1–3, Table 1) with two target proteins, KDM4C and KDM1A, which
are involved in epigenetic regulation. The results demonstrate that
HDX-MS can probe and validate weak (micromolar KD) interactions of the PD-derived peptide ligands with their
target proteins. Rigorous analysis of replicate HDX-MS data and comparison
to a nonbinding peptide allow for the accurate detection of low-affinity
binding events and ligand-induced structural rearrangements in the
target protein.

Experimental
Section
Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry
The peptides
were preincubated with KDM4C (expressed and purified as described
elsewhere12) or GST-KDM1A (expressed and
purified as described elsewhere13) for
30 min in order to allow target binding prior to deuterium labeling.
Continuous amide 1H/2H hydrogen exchange (HX)
was initiated by a 10-fold dilution of a protiated protein stock solution
in the presence or absence of ligand into the corresponding deuterated
buffer (HEPES (12.5 mM, pH 7.4), FeSO4 (5 μM), ascorbate
(100 μM)). Nondeuterated controls were prepared by dilution
into an identical protiated buffer. All HDX reactions were carried
out at room temperature and contained KDM4C (1.2 μM) or KDM1A
(0.8 μM) in the absence or presence of peptide (160 μM).
At appropriate time points (ranging from 15 s to 8 h), aliquots of
the HDX reaction were quenched by addition of an equal volume of ice-cold
quenching buffer (containing TRIS (1.25 M, pH 2.15) and TCEP (125
mM) for KDM4C and TRIS (1.25 M, pH 2.15), guanidine (6 M), and TCEP
(250 mM) for GST-KDM1A) resulting in a final pH of 2.3. Quenched samples
were immediately frozen and stored at −80 °C. Samples
were injected into a cooled Waters nanoAcquity UPLC system for online
pepsin digestion and rapid desalting of the protein samples. After
digestion of the samples, the peptic peptides were trapped on a precolumn
(Waters VanGuard C18, 1.7 μm, 2.1 × 5 mm, Milford, MA,
USA) and desalted with 0.68% formic acid, pH 2.3, 150 μL/min
for 3 min. Peptides were eluted from the trap to the analytical column
(Waters XBridge C18, 1.7 μm, 1.0 mm × 100 mm) and separated
with an 8–40% gradient of 0.68% formic acid in acetonitrile
(pH 2.3) over 12 min at a flow rate of 40 μL/min. Positive ion-electrospray
ionization mass spectra of eluted peptides were acquired on a Waters
SynaptG2 HDMS mass spectrometer. Peptic peptides were identified in
separate experiments using collision-induced dissociation tandem mass
spectrometry performed with a data-independent (MSE) acquisition
scheme. Sequence coverage maps of peptic peptides of KDM4C and GST-KDM1A
are shown in Figures S4 and S5, Supporting Information. The sequence coverage was 91.7% with a redundancy of 1.84 for KDM4C
and 92.6% with a redundancy of 1.61 for KDM1A. Mass spectra were processed
using the MassLynx and DynamX software packages (Waters Corp.); bimodal
curve fitting was performed using HX-Express.14 Complete deuteration of control samples was achieved by incubation
of 60 pmol of KDM4C (40 pmol KDM1A) in the deuterated buffer in the
presence of 6 M guanidine for 24 h at 30 °C. Average back exchange
(i.e., deuterium loss) was measured as 37%. However, no corrections
were made for this deuterium loss as only the relative levels of deuterium
incorporation of all samples were compared. The HDX of KDM4C in the
presence and absence of peptide after a 10 min exchange was measured
in triplicate to confirm the significance of the detected changes
in deuterium uptake. Changes in deuterium uptake were considered significant
if they exceeded the triple standard deviation and/or passed a two-tailed,
unpaired t-test (p < 0.05). Protein
structures were visualized using PyMOL (DeLano Scientific). ETD-HDX-MS
was performed as described elsewhere.15 For each ETD experiment, 240 pmol of KDM4C was preincubated with
3.42 nmol of peptide 2 for 30 min and then diluted 10-fold into deuterated
buffer. The absence of H/D scrambling was monitored by examining the
deuterium uptake of the charge-reduced and the deammoniated ion species.16 ETD was performed in the trap traveling wave
ion guide using 1,4-dicyanobenzene as the ETD reagent (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, USA).

Peptide Synthesis and Testing
Peptide
1 was purchased
from GenScript USA Inc. (NJ, USA); the purity was stated by the manufacturer
to be >95%. Peptides 2 and 3 were synthesized, purified, and characterized
as described elsewhere.17 The peptide sequences
are shown in Table 1. For inhibition studies
on KDM1A, a peroxidase-coupled assay monitoring hydrogen peroxide
production was performed as previously described.18 KDM1A expression and purification was carried out as described
elsewhere;13 non-GST-tagged KDM1A was purchased
from BPS Biosciences (#50097). The time courses of the reaction were
measured under aerobic conditions using a Beckman Instruments DU series
600 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostat-controlled cell holder
(T = 25 °C). The 100 μL reactions were
initiated by addition of enzyme (100–200 nM) to the reaction
mixture (HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5), 4-aminoantipyrine (0.1 mM),
3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid (1 mM), horseradish peroxidase
(0.76 μM, Worthington Biochemical Corp.), peptide 1 (100 μM),
and H3K4me2 histone peptide substrate (24 μM)). Absorbance changes
were monitored at 515 nm, and an extinction coefficient of 26 000
M–1·cm–1 was used to calculate
product formation. For curve fitting and data analysis, GraphPad Prism
6.0 was used.

Results and Discussion
Workflow Optimization for
the Detection of Low Affinity Peptide/Protein
Interactions by HDX-MS
The general workflow for the discovery,
validation, and analysis of peptides by PD and HDX-MS is depicted
in Scheme 1. The traditional HDX-MS workflow
for protein–ligand analysis had to be adapted to allow the
analysis of low affinity peptide/protein interactions. Previously
published protocols for HDX-MS of protein–ligand interactions
utilize 5–10 times excess of ligand over protein.19,20 However, these conditions are optimized for nano- or picomolar affinities
between ligand and protein; the affinities of the peptide ligands
tested here were in the micromolar range. Theoretical calculations
estimating the percentage of protein-bound peptide from its IC50 value revealed that a 130-fold molar excess of peptide compared
to the protein had to be used to ensure sufficient occupancy of the
protein with peptide. Further, the samples were allowed to preincubate
for 30 min at room temperature prior to deuterium labeling to ensure
equilibrium binding of the peptide to the protein. Unfortunately,
the large amount of peptide (5–15 μg per run) led to
overloading of the chromatographic system and resulted in increased
carryover between the chromatographic runs. An extensive washing procedure
consisting of three serial gradients flushing the column of excess
peptide had to be implemented to decrease the carryover. In addition,
we found that the vast excess of peptide resulted in ion suppression;
the quantitative analysis of 19 different peptic peptides covering
the whole protein sequence of KDM4C revealed that 80% of the signal
intensities were lost upon peptide addition. Hence, higher protein
concentrations had to be used to ensure sufficient sequence coverage
upon ligand addition. Further, PD-derived peptides are prone to proteolytic
cleavage by pepsin because they often have an unusually high content
of aromatic amino acids.21 This is due
to the fact that the active site of an enzyme is often composed of
a hydrophobic cleft, and the free energy gained by burying aromatic
residues in this cleft drives the binding of the peptides.22 For instance, peptic cleavage of one of the
peptide ligands resulted in truncated peptides that interfered with
detection of peptides from the target protein. In addition, signal
overlap from the multiplicity of peptic peptides from the protein
sample and synthesis impurities from the ligand sample can give rise
to interference. To circumvent these challenges, we made use of orthogonal
gas-phase separation of the peptide ligand from the target protein
peptides by ion mobility. Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) separates
analyte ions in a drift tube filled with a carrier gas in the presence
of an electrical field.23 The analytes’
mobility in the drift tube depends on its mass, size, charge, and
shape. The utility of coupling IMS to the HDX-MS workflow has been
demonstrated previously;200 here we found
the increased separation capability particularly useful in HDX-MS
analyses of weak peptide–protein interactions. As an example,
Figure 1 shows a singly charged peptide ion
of interest from KDM4C with an overlapping doubly charged peptide
ion (not identified). The extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) shows the
overlapping species coeluting after 3.8 min (Figure 1A). As shown in the right panel of Figure 1, the 2+ cluster overlaps with the 1+ cluster, making the
accurate measurement of average mass impossible. Conventional chromatography
failed to isolate the two species; however, the use of IMS led to
full separation of these species due to different drift times (Figure 1B).

the KDM4C

with a 2+ cluster originating from the protein/peptide sample. The
insets show the mass spectra integrated over the indicated chromatographic
range.

Scheme 1 General Workflow for the Integration
of PD Lead Discovery and Interaction
Analysis of Peptides and Proteins by HDX-MS
Over 3–5 rounds of
biopanning, PD can enrich for one, or several, peptide–phages
interacting with the immobilized target protein. The binding peptide
sequences are obtained by DNA sequencing of the enriched phages, subsequently
chemically synthesized, and then tested for their in vitro activity towards the target protein. Interaction analysis is then
performed between the peptide leads and the target protein by HDX-MS.
Briefly, HDX is initiated by diluting the protein in the presence
or absence of peptide into a deuterated buffer, and after different
periods of deuterium labeling, samples are taken and quenched. The
deuterated samples are then digested, and the peptic peptides are
analyzed by LC-MS and LC-MS/MS. Differential deuterium uptake plots
indicate a binding event (grey curve, free protein; red curve, peptide-bound
protein). The resolution of HDX-MS can be narrowed down from peptic
peptide to single amino acid level by ETD gas-phase fragmentation.35

When analyzing weak
peptide–protein interactions with dissociation
constants in the micromolar range by HDX-MS, even a large excess of
peptide will not result in a fully bound population of protein to
ligand at equilibrium. Depending on the concentrations and the dilution
factor upon initiation of the HDX reaction, the labeling reaction
will typically only be possible with 50–75% of the protein
in the ligand-bound state. Thus, changes in HDX resulting from ligand
binding will be scaled down, and the reductions in deuterium uptake
upon binding of low affinity peptide ligands are likely to be small
in magnitude. To account for this, our optimized HDX-MS workflow dictates
a comprehensive statistical analysis from replicate experiments, allowing
the identification of all sites that display protection effects from
HDX, even if they are minor (<0.5 D). In the cases of KDM4C and
KDM1A described here, changes in HDX ranged from 0.2 to 2 D upon ligand
interaction. In our protocol, we consider changes in deuterium uptake
to be significant if they exceeded the triple standard deviation and/or
passed a two-tailed, unpaired t-test (p < 0.05). We find that these threshold values are in good agreement
with a previously published study that investigates a nonpeptidic
ligand binding to microtubulin.24

HDX-MS
Analysis of the Interactions of Peptide Ligands with
the Histone Demethylases KDM1A and KDM4C
We recently reported
the discovery of several peptide ligands binding to the two histone
demethylases KDM1A and KDM4C by phage display.17 The crystal structures of KDM1A and KDM4C are shown in
Figure 2. KDM1A belongs to the family of flavin-dependent
monoamine oxidases and contains a SWIRM domain, a FAD-binding motif,
and an amino oxidase domain, as well as a tower domain which promotes
binding to the transcription factor CoREST.25 KDM4C is a jumonji-domain containing protein consisting of an N-terminal
JmjN and a JmjC domain, as well as two C-terminal PHD and Tudor domains.26 In this study, a truncated, (His)6-tagged version of KDM4C was used, only containing the catalytic
core domains JmjN and JmjC. The KDM1A protein was expressed with an
N-terminal GST-tag.

Figure 2 Structural models of the peptide ligand targets KDM1A
(A, pdb 2Z3Y) and KDM4C (B, pdb 2XML) as determined by
X-ray crystallography.

Through 4–5 rounds of biopanning against (His)6-ccKDM4C and GST-KDM1A, phage display led to the discovery
of one
peptide binding to KDM1A and two further peptides interacting with
KDM4C. These peptides were optimized to improve their inhibitory activity
on the target proteins and their druggability; two of the second generation
peptides targeting KDM4C, as well as a first generation peptide directed
against KDM1A, were used in this study for HDX-MS analysis, workflow
development, and optimization (Table 1).

Histone Demethylase KDM4C
We recently identified two
peptides (2 and 3, Table 1) interacting with
KDM4C by PD.17 In an in vitro TR-FRET demethylase assay, the inhibition constants of these peptides
were found to be in the high μM range. In a cell-based assay,
none of the peptides showed any inhibitory activity, most probably
due to insufficient cellular uptake. In order to design more cell-permeable
peptidomimetics, we set out to determine the crystal structure of
the peptides in complex with KDM4C. Despite extensive efforts, no
crystals containing the peptides could be obtained; therefore, their
binding sites were investigated by HDX-MS. Four different sites on
KDM4C showed altered deuterium uptake upon peptide addition, and an
alanine scan revealed functionally important amino acids in the peptide
ligands. On the basis of these findings, the initial peptide leads
were truncated and structure optimized, and these second generation
peptide ligands (peptides 2 and 3) displayed an apparent increase
in activity by 10-fold.17 Here, we describe
how HDX-MS can be used for a comprehensive, in-depth investigation
of the differences between the initial hits from the PD and the second
generation peptide ligands. Changes in peptide binding mode and target
engagement are analyzed and validated using our tailored HDX-MS protocol.

The mode of interaction between peptides 2 and 3 and KDM4C was
studied by HDX-MS and revealed that both peptides led to a reduction
of deuterium uptake along the KDM4C sites 113–120 (A) and 166–174
(B); while peptide 3 additionally reduced deuterium
uptake of the neighboring α-helical regions 248–275 (C)
and 331–344 (D) (Figure 3). No reduction
of deuterium uptake was observed along site C in the presence of peptide
2. The significance of these results was verified through triplicate
measurements after 10 min of deuterium labeling in the presence and
absence of peptide ligand. Table S1, Supporting
Information, shows the numerical values of differential deuterium
uptake and their standard deviations after 10 min HDX.

of sites 113–120 (A), 166–174
(B), 248–275 (C), and 331–344 (D) of peptides 2 (red),
3 (blue), and 4 (green) against free KDM4C (gray curves). The crystal
structure shows KDM4A (pdb 2VD7) in complex with histone peptide substrate (blue spheres)
and the catalytic Fe2+ ion (red sphere); sites A and B
are colored red; sites C and D are shown in orange (n = 3; ∗, p < 0.05; ∗∗, p < 0.01).

To exclude the possibility that the detected changes are
due to
nonspecific binding events related to the high peptide concentrations
employed during the labeling reaction, we have used the additional,
noninhibitory peptide 4 (Table 1) to control
for nonspecific binding. No significant differences in deuterium uptake
levels along the sites of interest were observed upon addition of
peptide 4 (Figure 3 and Table S1, Supporting Information), confirming that the
observed effects indeed result from specific interactions between
peptides 2−3 and KDM4C.

To further probe and reveal the
full impact of peptide 2 on KDM4C
conformation and dynamics, we performed a triplicate HDX-MS analysis
of the KDM4C-peptide 2 complex across a longer HDX time range (up
to 480 min). Furthermore, a comprehensive statistical analysis of
all data was applied to detect small yet significant perturbations
in HDX upon ligand binding. Figure 4 shows
an overview of all analyzed peptides after 240 min of HDX where significance
was defined as changes in deuterium uptake that are bigger than the
triple standard deviation and a p < 0.05 in an
unpaired, two-tailed t-test. The complete deuterium
uptake curves ± peptide 2 are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). Using this procedure,
several additional sites, 99–112, 121–135, 136–156,
156–165, and 359–370, were identified in the vicinity
of primary identified sites with significantly perturbed HDX in the
presence of peptide 2. Some of those reductions in HDX were only significant
after 240 min of HDX, and the additional time point (480 min) was
used to further verify their validity (data not shown). When mapped
onto the crystal structure of KDM4C, it becomes obvious that these
peptides lay in between the initially identified sites A and B and
C and D that show perturbed HDX upon ligand interaction (Figure S2, Supporting Information). For the two peptic peptides
KDM4C99-105 and KDM4C104-112, overlapping with site 99–112,
observed changes in HDX were not significant due to an elevated standard
deviation (Figure S1, Supporting Information) and the protection effects could not be confirmed after 480 min
due to poor data quality. These observations emphasize the importance
of using significance analysis when assessing HDX-MS data from low
affinity ligand binding experiments. Furthermore, the perturbation
in HDX along site 359–370 was only significant after 10 min
(Figure S1, Supporting Information).

structure of the catalytic core of KDM4C is indicated below the x-axis; the amino acids critical for 2-OG binding are highlighted

(n = 3, error bars are standard deviation of the
mean; ∗, p < 0.05; ∗∗, p < 0.01).

The peptic peptides reaching from 99−174 lay within
a functionally
unassigned region between the JmjN and the enzymatically active JmjC
domain of KDM4C (Figure 4). The other two peptic
peptides showing perturbations in HDX upon ligand interaction, KDM4C331–344
and 359–370, are partially located within the JmjC domain.27,28 Except for Ala108, Asn125, and Asp174, none of the functionally important residues of KDM4C overlap with
these peptides. This indicates that the peptides are not inhibiting
KDM4C through substrate competition, a hypothesis that is supported
by the atypical inhibition kinetics displayed by analogues of peptides
2 and 3.17 Instead, it can be hypothesized
that the peptides bind to regions involved in protein–protein
interaction on the surface of KDM4C by structurally mimicking interacting
proteins. Actually, many epigenetic enzymes are known to interact
with numerous other proteins; e.g., KDM4C is known to bind the histone
deacetylases HDAC1 and −3,29 and
various other proteins have been implicated for KDM4C interaction,
supporting this assumption. The discovery of peptides mimicking protein–protein
interactions by phage display is a well-known phenomenon termed convergent
evolution.3

Peptide 2 was derived
and optimized from an initial phage display
peptide scaffold reported previously.17 The optimization of peptide 2 included the truncation
of the peptide scaffold and the insertion
of m-xylene into the disulfide bridge. While the
initial PD peptide significantly reduced deuterium uptake along site
D similar to peptide 3 (data not shown), a close inspection of HDX
raw data revealed that peptide 2 induced unusual HDX kinetics in site
D of KDM4C. Site D (331–344) displayed a pronounced bimodal
isotopic distribution in the presence of peptide 2 (Figure 5) indicating the occurrence of two distinct conformations
in this region of KDM4C that interconvert with slow dynamics (EX1
kinetics).30 Neither the original phage
display hit nor peptide 3 led to such pronounced bimodal patterns
in site D. To confirm that the observed EX1 phenomenon was not due
to sample carryover from previous chromatographic runs,31 an optimized protocol consisting of 4 consecutive
washing steps and a subsequent blank was introduced to monitor and
minimize sample carryover. After this optimization, the inter-run
carryover for peptide 331–344 was reduced to >0.5%, verifying
that the observed peak broadening is indeed due to EX1 exchange kinetics.

Figure 5 Mass spectra
of KDM4C peptic peptide 331–344 in the absence
and presence of peptide 2 after different times of HDX. The spectra
without ligand were fitted to a binomial and the spectra with ligand
to a bimodal peak distribution.

Duplicate analysis of a full HDX time course in the presence
and
absence of peptide 2 according to the optimized protocol confirmed
the occurrence of EX1 kinetics in the presence of peptide 2 with a
good fit to a bimodal model and a change in peak width of 4.1 ±
0.4 m/z. We note that a slight broadening
of the peak in the absence of ligand is observed around 60 min, yet
this data had a good fit to a standard binomial distribution and did
not fit adequately to a bimodal distribution.14 Thus, the occurrence of two distinct populations (Figure 5) upon peptide binding suggests that peptide 2 induces
slow unfolding dynamics in this region. An alternate explanation for
the bimodal peak pattern could be slow binding kinetics of peptide
2 (slow kon), a phenomenon that has been
observed previously.32,33

To sublocalize residues
in site D involved in EX1 kinetics upon
peptide 2 interaction, the peptic peptide KDM4C331–344 was
analyzed by electron transfer dissociation (ETD) tandem mass spectrometry.
It has recently been shown that gas-phase fragmentation by ETD can
be incorporated into the HDX-MS workflow to allow extraction of HDX
information for individual amino acid residues in proteins.34,35 The peptic peptide KDM4C331–344 fragmented sufficiently to
allow a comprehensive analysis of deuterium uptake at single amino
acid level. The c-ion series c4–c11 revealed that the perturbed sites involved
in EX1 kinetics in the presence of peptide 2 are located in the vicinity
of residue Asp337 (Figure 6A). The irregular
isotopic distribution in the c7 fragment
ion spectrum indicates that EX1 kinetics occur from Asp337 toward
the C-terminus of the peptide (Figure 6A,C).
This region of 331–344 is buried underneath helix 359–370
and points toward that neighboring helix. Helix 359–370 shows
reduced HDX (significant only after 10 min; see Figure S1, Supporting Information) but no EX1 exchange kinetics
(data not shown). Likely, ligand interaction induces slow folding/refolding
EX1 kinetics in the underlying helical region 331–344 in an
indirect manner through helix 359–370. The ETD data support
this hypothesis, as the C-terminal half of helix 331–344 observed
to undergo slow unfolding dynamics upon peptide 2 interaction is in

Asp337 are displayed as sticks.

Three residues in helix 359–370 settle in a box-like
arrangement
(pygo-box), similar to the PHD finger of hPygol that recognizes tri-
and dimethylated H3K4 residues. It has been hypothesized that the
trimethylated K4 residue of H3 is in the proximity of this pygo-box;
however, a conformational change in the C-terminal domain of the KDM4
family of proteins is required to accommodate the complete substrate.
Our results appear to corroborate this hypothesis, as the observed
EX1-type kinetics indicate that this part of the C-terminal domain
of KDM4C possesses unusual conformational flexibility, which in turn
could help facilitate the binding of other histone substrates than
tri- and dimethylated H3K9.36

Histone Demethylase
KDM1A
PD identified peptide 1 as
a binder of GST-KDM1A, and the resynthesized peptide showed mixed
inhibition of GST-KDM1A in an in vitro demethylase
activity assay (Figure S3A, Supporting Information). Analysis of the binding of peptide 1 to GST-KDM1A using our optimized
HDX-MS workflow revealed decreased deuterium uptake along region 101–114
(Figure 7B,D). Interestingly, this site resides
in the GST-tag, implying that peptide 1 effectively does not interact
with KDM1A but rather with the GST protein fused to the N-terminus
of KDM1A for purification purposes. No other peptides covering the
sequence of KDM1A displayed changes in deuterium uptake upon peptide
addition (an example is shown in Figure 7A,C).
To validate our findings from HDX-MS, a cross-affinity ELISA of the
peptide-1-phage against recombinant GST protein was performed, showing
that the peptide-1-phage indeed binds the GST protein (Figure S3C, Supporting Information). This confirms that the
interaction between KDM1A101–114 and peptide 1 detected by
HDX-MS is not an artifact. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of
peptide 1 was reassessed using recombinant KDM1A protein without a
GST-tag, and no inhibitory activity of peptide 1 could be detected
for this KDM1A construct (Figure S3B, Supporting
Information). The inhibitory activity of peptide 1 toward GST-KDM1A
can probably be explained on the basis of the close proximity of the
GST-tag to the N-terminus of KDM1A; the binding site 101–114
is thereby located next to the actual KDM1A protein.

in the absence of peptide 1, and red/blue curves indicate deuterium
uptake in its presence. (E) The α helix highlighted in blue
represents KDM1A269–284 (pdb 2Z3Y).

The example of GST-KDM1A illustrates the identification of
a peptide
ligand by phage display that inhibits the target protein in
vitro without actually interacting with it. Though purification
tags are an important tool in protein biochemistry and especially
the fusion of proteins with GST can assist protein solubilization
and stability,37 our findings emphasize
the benefit of using small or cleavable purification tags for proteins
employed in drug discovery. Furthermore, identified interactors of
proteins should always be validated using different methods and/or
different constructs of the protein. Our findings are in accord with
a previously published study showing that large purification tags
can influence protein structure and activity and thereby lead to the
identification of false-positives.38

Conclusions
Here, we report the optimization and validation
of an HDX-MS workflow
to dissect the binding modes of phage display-derived low-affinity
peptide ligands on their target proteins. Using a panel of peptide
ligands binding to the two epigenetic regulator proteins KDM4C and
KDM1A, we exemplify the advantages and challenges of combining these
two technologies. Our results show that HDX-MS can provide an alternative
analytical tool for validating and optimizing drug scaffolds from
high-throughput screening methods such as phage display. The workflow
was optimized by implementation of IMS and ETD to achieve better sensitivity
as well as the use of a nonbinding control peptide and statistical
analysis of replicate data. As shown by the example of KDM4C, several
hits from phage display and/or optimized peptide lead structures can
be analyzed and compared to each other. By combining HDX-MS with ETD
fragmentation, higher resolution information can be obtained to explicitly
study changes in dynamics as a consequence of ligand interaction as
we show here for peptide 2 binding to KDM4C. To our knowledge, the
data presented here is the first example of the use of ETD to sublocalize
residues involved in slow conformational dynamics (EX1-type kinetics)
in a protein–ligand complex. There are some advantages of this
HDX-MS workflow compared to, i.e., X-ray crystallography: For instance,
a few hundred pmol of protein and 1 mg of peptide will often be sufficient
to conduct and obtain HDX data on a protein-peptide interaction. The
effects of peptide binding to the protein are measured in the solution
phase and therefore more closely reflect native conditions for the
target protein. Both direct and indirect dynamic effects on the target
protein conformation upon ligand binding are detected. In effect,
HDX-MS reveals the “dynamic” binding site on the target
protein, which provides a solution-phase view of all backbone amide
sites perturbed by peptide interaction. The example of KDM1A shows
how HDX-MS can be used to validate hits from phage display and identify
false-positives. Finally, it should be noted that the method is quite
tolerant to molecular size, also allowing the analysis of large complexes
such as antibodies binding to protein targets.

In summary, HDX-MS
can be used to study low affinity peptide/protein
interactions that are not accessible by traditional structure elucidation
techniques. Our findings indicate that HDX-MS can provide a much-needed
alternative analytical tool to understand the conformational dynamics
of weak peptide–protein interactions important in both chemical
biology research and early stage drug development.
