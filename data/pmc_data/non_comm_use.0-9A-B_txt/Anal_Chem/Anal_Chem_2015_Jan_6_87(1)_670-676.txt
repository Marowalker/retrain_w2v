This study presents on-tissue proteolytic
digestion using a microwave
irradiation and peptide extraction method for in situ analysis of proteins from spatially defined regions of a tissue
section. The methodology utilizes hydrogel discs (1 mm diameter) embedded
with trypsin solution. The enzyme-laced hydrogel discs are applied
to a tissue section, directing enzymatic digestion to a spatially
confined area of the tissue. By applying microwave radiation, protein
digestion is performed in 2 min on-tissue, and the extracted peptides
are then analyzed by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass
spectrometry (MALDI MS) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS). The reliability and reproducibility of the microwave assisted
hydrogel mediated on-tissue digestion is demonstrated by the comparison
with other on-tissue digestion strategies, including comparisons with
conventional heating and in-solution digestion. LC-MS/MS data were
evaluated considering the number of identified proteins as well as
the number of protein groups and distinct peptides. The results of
this study demonstrate that rapid and reliable protein digestion can
be performed on a single thin tissue section while preserving the
relationship between the molecular information obtained and the tissue
architecture, and the resulting peptides can be extracted in sufficient
abundance to permit analysis using LC-MS/MS. This approach will be
most useful for samples that have limited availability but are needed
for multiple analyses, especially for the correlation of proteomics
data with histology and immunohistochemistry.

==== Body
Tissue analyses,
including histomorphological
and immunohistochemical approaches, form the basis for most diagnostic
analyses in anatomic pathology.1 Highly
standardized approaches and rigorous training regimens have been instituted
to ensure that these morphological approaches to disease characterization
deliver a high standard of care. However, there still exist situations
for which the current methods do not provide definitive diagnoses
and new technological approaches that incorporate molecular analysis
would add significant value to the diagnostic process.2 The development of proteomics and mass spectrometry technologies
during the previous decade has enabled rapid and specific protein
analyses. These technical advances now provide the opportunity to
contribute molecular information with high chemical and spatial specificity
at sufficient throughput to aid in the histopathological evaluation
of patient specimens.3−8

Protein analysis and identification are traditionally performed
through the use of one of two different strategies. Proteins can be
separated by gel electrophoresis in one or two dimensions (1D/2D)
and enzymatic digestion is performed in-gel, a time-consuming and
manual process.9 In a second solution-based
approach, proteins or peptides can be separated chromatographically
using on-line liquid chromatography (LC) systems and the proteins
digested in solution prior to the chromatographic analysis.10 The in-solution approach tends to be the simplest
in terms of sample handling and speed, but the digestion step is still
the most time-consuming step in the sample preparation workflow.11,12 Another disadvantage to this approach is the requirement for sample
homogenization. Common proteomics workflows such as those described
require microgram to milligram quantities of proteins to be extracted
from the tissue to provide sufficient material to perform the analysis.
This requires the homogenization of the bulk sample, a step that can
significantly diminish the possibility of studying specific groups
of cells in relation to their native environment in the tissue.

Histology-guided approaches for the analysis of tissues have been
developed that can overcome these problems. For example, many groups
have reported the use of laser microdissection (LM) to sample specific
cell types from tissues (both fresh and formalin fixed)13,14 and subsequently analyze these samples using a variety of genomics
and proteomics approaches.15−17 This approach has been utilized
to study the molecular content in histologically distinct tissue regions
in a variety of disease states.18−20 Furthermore, there now exists
a proteomics-based diagnostic test that combine LM with liquid chromatography
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to type specific amyloid proteins
in patient biopsies.21 In spite of the
advantages and the utility of LM as a sampling approach for proteomics
of tissue specimens, throughput is very limited, making it difficult
to be used routinely.

In a new approach, digestion is performed
directly on cryosectioned
tissue, and the constituent peptides of the proteins contained therein
are identified directly from the tissue by tandem MS (MS/MS) and accurate
mass measurements. The bottom-up approach, including in situ proteolytic digestion, is often used to identify a pool of proteins
from which many potential biomarkers are most likely derived.22

Many traditional proteomic methodologies
to identify proteins may
involve one of several steps such as microextraction with solvents
from the tissue surface, tissue homogenization using multiple tissue
sections or LM of the regions of interest in a single tissue section.23−25 All of these approaches require overnight digestion, a procedure
that can be problematic for analyses of such small volumes on-tissue
surfaces where evaporation and delocalization of the solvent can stop
the digestion prematurely.

The enzymatic digestion step is commonly
the bottleneck of the
workflows used in proteomics. Previously, many research teams have
developed new protocols for protein digestion and identification that
are designed to reduce the sample handling while increasing sample
throughput.26 These two goals have been
achieved by reducing the total time of the entire workflow or increasing
the number of samples treated at the same time.10 Many tools have been successfully used to accelerate the
enzymatic digestion of proteins: for example, heating, microspin columns,
ultrasonic energy, high pressure, infrared energy, alternating electric
field or microwave.9,27−30 While microwave assisted proteolytic
digestion has traditionally been implemented in solution, there is
a growing trend to use heterogeneous systems for on-tissue digestion
in which enzyme is carried within hydrogels or adsorbed on solid supports.31,32

Molecular hydrogels have attracted extensive research interest
because of their great potential for tissue engineering, migration
of organic and inorganic material, drug delivery as well as a miniaturized
method for application on biological samples.32−36 Recently, Harris et al. performed on-tissue digestion
within an ionotropic hydrogel on fresh frozen rat brain tissue utilizing
chromatography paper as a fabrication template.37 Further, Nicklay et al. have used these hydrogel devices
for the identification of integral membrane proteins, optimizing a
specific tissue washing step.38

In
the current work, we combine the use of hydrogel disks (1 mm
diameter) embedded with trypsin solution and the use of microwave
irradiation (2 min) to speed the enzymatic digestion for protein identification
while sampling a histologically defined region on the tissue. The
objective of this study was to develop an on-tissue microwave assisted
protein digestion method that optimizes the sample handling and increases
the protein identification efficiency for LC-MS/MS analysis. More
peptides and higher sequence coverage could be obtained from the proteins
extracted by the hydrogel/microwave digestion method as compared to
digestion approaches that utilize conventional methods of extraction
and heating. We illustrate the performance of this method for histology-directed
on-tissue digestion for the proteome analysis of rat brain tissue,
targeting the thalamic region.

Materials and Methods
Acrylamide/bisacrylamide
was purchased from Biorad Life Sciences
(Hercules, CA, USA). Ammonium persulfate, ammonium bicarbonate, the
MALDI matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (98%), trifluoroacetic
(TFA) and formic (FA) acids were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA). Punch biopsies were purchased from Acuderm,
Inc. (Ft. Lauderdale, FL). Mass spectrometry grade Trypsin Gold was
purchased from Promega Corporation (Madison, WI, USA), high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade solvents (ethanol, xylenes, methanol
and acetonitrile) and histological dyes (hematoxylin and eosin) were
from Fisher Scientific (Fairlawn, NJ, USA), and xylene was from Acros
(Morris Plains, NJ). Water was generated using a Millipore Milli-Q
Synthesis A10 (Billerica, MA, USA). All reagents listed were used
without additional purification.

Hydrogel Discs Fabrication
Fabrication
of 7.5% polyacrylamide
hydrogels was carried out by modification of a previously developed
procedure:38 A volume of 1.24 mL of 30%
acrylamide/bis(acrylamide) solution was added to 1.26 mL of Tris buffer
at pH 6.8 and 2.45 mL of water. The solution was degassed under vacuum
for a minimum of 30 min before adding 50 μL of 10% ammonium
persulfate and of 10 μL of tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED).
The solution was mixed by inversion and placed into a small Petri
dish to polymerize for 30 min. Finally, punch biopsy tools were used
to cut the microwells in a variety of sizes (1, 1.5, 3 mm diameter).
Each individual microwell of hydrogel was placed in an eppendorf tube,
dried fully in a speedvac and stored at −80 °C until use.

Tissue
Sectioning and Pretreatment
Fresh frozen rat
brain was purchased from Pel-Freez Biologicals (Rogers, AZ) and tissue
sections were prepared at an 8 μm thickness using a Leica CM3050
cryostat (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). Frozen tissue
sections were thaw mounted on microscope slides or placed into eppendorf
tubes (for the homogenization procedure) and stored in a desiccator
until needed. Each tissue section was rinsed using ethanol (70%, 30
s; 95%, 30 s) to remove salts and lipids and to obtain optimal sensitivity
for MS analysis of the digested extracts.39

On-Tissue Microwave Digestion
Hydrogels (1 mm diameter)
were rehydrated for 15 min using 20 μL of 1 μg/mL trypsin
(in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate) and then placed over the tissue region
of interest (brain thalamic region) onto the whole tissue surface
guided by the histological features on corresponding serial H&E
stained tissue section. The tissue sections were incubated in a microwave
oven (1.65 kW) for 2 min set at 10% of the power, to accelerate protein
digestion. Each hydrogel disc was removed from the tissue section
and placed in separate eppendorf tubes. Peptides imbibed into the
microwell hydrogels were extracted by organic (50% acetonitrile/5%
formic acid) and aqueous (100 mM ammonium bicarbonate) solvents, a
process that was repeated three times. The supernatants collected
from each extraction were combined and dried in a centrifugal vacuum
concentrator (SPD Speedvac, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
The reconstituted extracts (20 μL, 0.1% formic acid) were spotted
for matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry
(MALDI MS) analysis, mixed with CHCA, 10 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile,
0.5% TFA, and then stored at −20 °C until LC-MS/MS analysis
was performed.

Other On-Tissue Digestion Strategies
Further protein
digestion experiments were carried out on serially prepared tissue
sections. First, tissue sections were incubated using a conventional
oven at 50 °C for 4 h: hydrogel discs were still used to allow
the digestion to take place on the brain thalamic region. After digestion,
peptides were extracted from the gel following the same procedure
already described for the microwave digestion. Second, because hydrogels
were fabricated at 1 mm diameter, the rat brain biopsy was also punched
into the thalamic region using a 1 mm punch biopsy tool. This approach
precisely controls the amount of tissue exposed to the hydrogel and
allows for the homogenization and digestion of the same amount of
tissue using conventional sample preparation methods. Serial sections
from the 1 mm tissue core were cryosectioned following the same protocol
described above. One set of digestion experiments was carried out: n = 3 tissue core sections were mounted on microscope slides
and hydrogel discs (trypsin embedded) were placed on top and incubated
via conventional oven at 50 °C for 4 h. Second, n = 3 tissue core sections were marked using a hydrophobic pen and
trypsin (20 μL of 1 μg/mL trypsin in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate)
was manually spotted and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Finally,
other serial tissue core sections from the same tissue specimen were
placed into separate eppendorf tubes and the homogenized as previously
described.40 The digestion was conducted
at 37 °C overnight, and the digested peptides were extracted
following the same procedure described for the hydrogel experiments.

Mass
Spectrometry Analysis and Data Processing
MALDI
MS analyses were carried out using an Ultraflextreme MALDI TOF/TOF
mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) equipped with
a SmartBeam II laser and operating in positive polarity, reflectron
mode. Spectra were acquired in the range of m/z 500–4000. Flex Control 3.3 software was used for
spectra acquisition. The reproducibility of the hydrogel-based digestion
was evaluated using a set of three technical replicates within the
same tissue sample at different but histologically identical locations.
All spectra were processed using the same preprocessing procedure
to ensure overall consistency. Briefly, they were baseline-corrected
and normalized according to their total ion current, excluding the
top 5% of intensity values to avoid bias by highly abundant species.
The Mann–Whitney U test and Kruskal–Wallis test were
applied to evaluate statistically significant of differences (protein
groups and distinct peptides) between groups (all different digestion
strategies). The Mann–Whitney U test and Kruskal–Wallis
test are the analogous nonparametric methods of t-test and one-way between-groups of variance (analysis of variance,
ANOVA), respectively.

LC-MS/MS analysis
Tryptic peptides
were analyzed by
a 70 min data dependent LC-MS/MS analysis. Briefly, peptides were
loaded via pressure cell onto a 40 × 0.1 mm self-packed reversed
phase (Jupiter 5 um, 300 A - Phenomonex) trapping column fritted into
an M520 filter union (IDEX). After loading and equilibration, this
trapping column was attached to a 200 × 0.1 mm (Jupiter 3 μm,
300A), self-packed analytical column coupled directly to an LTQ (ThermoFisher)
using a nanoelectrospray source. A series of full scan mass spectra
followed by 5 data-dependent tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) was collected
throughout the run, and dynamic exclusion was enabled to minimize
acquisition of redundant spectra. MS/MS spectra were searched to identify
tryptic fragments via SEQUEST against a rat database (UniprotKB, Rattus norvegicus) that also contained a reversed
version for each of the entries.41 Identifications
were filtered to 2 peptides per protein and 0.1% peptide false detection
rate and collated at the protein level using Scaffold (Proteome Software).
Furthermore, IDPicker 3 software used to filter the resulting identifications
to a 5% FDR at the peptide level and collate the individual proteins,
requiring a minimum of 2 peptides per protein.42

Results and discussion
The aims
of this study were to demonstrate both the reliability
and the relative advantages of the use of microwave radiation to speed
up the on-tissue proteomics workflow and to demonstrate the methodology
to perform the enzymatic digestion in a histologically defined region
on a thin 8 μm tissue section. Various on-tissue digestion strategies
were carried out on the same sample to provide a basis for comparison.
A series of experiments were designed and carried out using rat brain
serial sections from the same tissue specimen, to avoid tissue proteome
variability. Figure 1 shows a graphical depiction
of the experimental design used in this study. Fresh frozen rat brain
biopsies were first sectioned at an 8 μm thickness and then
stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histological evaluation
of regions of interest, such as the thalamic region. Hydrogel discs,
prepared on a prior day and stored, were reconstituted in trypsin
solution for 15 min and then placed on the rat brain thalamic region.
First, on-tissue digestion experiments were carried out: Figure 1a shows two different digestion strategies (microwave
and conventional heating) performed on the whole tissue section using
the hydrogel disc for the histology-directed digestion. Figure 1b displays another set of experiments performed
on the rat brain thalamic region punched from the bulk biopsy specimen
from a prior cryosection. The bulk specimen was stained to provide
a visual comparison of the areas sampled for analysis. The biopsied
tissue from the bulk specimen was sectioned at a thickness of 8 μm
to collect an amount of tissue comparable for that of the on-tissue
digestion.

of the brain thalamic region. Enzymatic digestions were performed
depositing the hydrogel disc embedded with trypsin on the thalamic
region and then incubating the tissue section into the microwave for
2 min; further, a consecutive cut tissue section was incubated in
an oven. (b) Rat brain punch biopsy was obtained from the thalamic
region at the same diameter of the hydrogel disc (1 mm) and then cryosectioned
at 8 μm. Protein digestion experiments were carried out using
the hydrogel device as well as manual spotting the enzyme solution
and homogenizing tissue sections within a conventional oven.

Solvent extracted digested peptides
obtained from the first two
hydrogel experiments, carried out on-tissue via microwave and oven,
were reconstituted and mixed with a solution of CHCA for MALDI MS
analyses. The resulting profile MALDI spectra are displayed in Figure 2. The peptide spectra are qualitatively comparable,
with most major ions present in both preparations in the mass range
measured (500–4000 Da). While most peaks are present, there
are notable relative intensity differences, likely due to the different
incubation strategy (microwave vs conventional oven). This result
should have little impact on downstream identification by LC-MS/MS;
however, these differences would not permit quantitative comparisons
between samples that have been prepared using two different on-tissue
digestion approaches. MALDI MS profiles of three technically replicated
microwave assisted hydrogel mediated on-tissue digested extracts are
presented in Figure 3. Most of the signals
are detected in all the three replicates, confirming the reliability
of the microwave procedure for the digestion.

Figure 2 MALDI MS spectra of the
solvent extracted digested peptides obtained
from the first two hydrogel experiments, carried out via microwave
(red) and oven (black). The resulting profiles display a high degree
similarity in the ions present in the mass range 500–4000 Da
(a) and in the mass range 1290–1360 Da (b).

Figure 3 MALDI MS spectra of the three technical replicates of
microwave
assisted hydrogel mediated on-tissue digested extracts. The resulting
profiles display a high degree similarity in both the ions present
and their relative abundance in the mass range 500–4000 Da.

To further validate the on-tissue
hydrogel/microwave digestion
approach, other on-tissue digestion experiments were carried out as
described in Figure 1b. Serial sections at
8 μm thickness and 1 mm diameter were cut from the thalamic
region of rat brain as described in the Materials
and Methods section. This experiment was performed to further
validate the extraction localized proteins by the hydrogel discs through
the exposure of a tissue surface cut at the same diameter which the
hydrogel discs were fabricated (1 mm). Rat brain thalamus proteins
were digested following three approaches: (1) using a hydrogel disc
and incubating the reaction for 4 h at 50 °C, (2) by deposition
of the trypsin solution onto the tissue surface and (3) by the homogenization
of tissue sections followed by protein extraction (see the Materials and Methods section); both the last two
approaches were allowed for digestion by overnight incubation at 37
°C (Figure 1b). All the digested extracts,
were analyzed by LC-MS/MS followed by database search for protein
identification. Data were processed using a 5% FDR, filtering the
identified proteins with number of unique peptides ≥2 and a p-value <0.05. Data are summarized in Figure 4 using Venn diagrams.

Figure 4 Venn diagrams summarizing
the number of identified proteins for N = 3 on-tissue
digestion experiments (5% FDR, ≥
2 unique peptides and p value <0.05). Panel a
shows the number of identified proteins within the microwave digested
extracts and the oven incubation digested extracts, both carried out
using the hydrogel disc placed onto the rat brain thalamic region;
panel b displays the number of identified proteins within the experiments
performed using the 1 mm diameter tissue section from the same region
of interest within the rat brain biopsy, using the hydrogel disc and
homogenizing the tissue sections, respectively.

The digestion strategies were evaluated and compared in different
ways: the first comparison was carried out considering the number
of identified proteins found when using microwave heating compared
to conventional heating in an oven. A large number of proteins (∼700)
were identified in both the microwave digestion strategy and the oven
incubation, both using the hydrogel disc (Figure 4a); this finding suggests that the hydrogel disc device allows
for a comparable degree of digestion in 2 min using microwave heating
as well as in 4 h using conventional heating. Relatively few proteins
were uniquely identified in one or the other approaches, respectively
9 from the microwave digestion and 10 from the oven digestion. This
finding confirms that by changing the method of heating to microwave
irradiation, we do not significantly alter the protein population
sampled from the brain tissue. Moreover, Figure 4b displays a Venn diagram comparing the number of identified proteins
within the experiments performed using the 1 mm diameter tissue sections
from the thalamic region of the rat brain. Also in this case, the
majority of the identified proteins (695) were identified using both
digested extracts (from the hydrogel disc and from the tissue homogenization),
while a few proteins were found uniquely expressed into the two set
of samples, respectively 5 from the sample from the hydrogel digestion
and 8 from the homogenization process (Figure 4b). Because homogenization is considered to be the most comprehensive
method of protein extraction from tissue, allowing for the most complete
disruption of tissue and cell architecture among the methods tested,
the hydrogel disc method displays a remarkable similarity to the results
obtained using the conventional homogenization approach. The manual
spotted digestion extracts were evaluated: the number of identified
proteins was found similar to the number of identified proteins from
the other strategies considered in this study (Figure S-2, Supporting Information).

All the different
on-tissue digestion strategies were further validated
using the LC-MS/MS data from the replicated experiments. Thus, two
parameters were considered for the comparison. The first parameter
was the number of protein groups, which defines the minimum number
of uniquely identified proteins (when several possible proteins have
highly similar sequences and cannot be distinguished by the peptides
identified in a given experiment, these proteins are reported as a
single group). The second parameter used for the evaluation of all
the different digestion strategies was the number of distinct peptides:
peptides are considered distinct when they identify unique sequences
of amino acids. Figure 5a displays the number
of protein groups and distinct peptides that were obtained from the
hydrogel digestion experiments performed using both the microwave
for 2 min and the conventional oven for 4 h: results were found to
be very similar for all the metrics compared. These results, along
with those of Figure 4a confirm that accelerating
the on-tissue digestion using microwave radiation is reliable and
it allows for an almost identical population of proteins to be identified.
Moreover, very few differences were found when comparing the number
of distinct peptides; however, we observed a statistically significant
increase of the peptides identified in the microwave digestion experiments.
Figure 5b illustrates the comparison between
the experiments performed on the 1 mm diameter rat brain thalamic
region. In this case, the number of protein groups was not significantly
changed among all the digestion strategies (Figure 5b). When the number of distinct peptides was considered, the
manual spotting digestion strategy gave higher values, although the
digestion efficiency of these approaches may have differed. However,
given that the same amount of trypsin was used in all the methods,
using the hydrogel disc as well as in the classic on-tissue digestions,
the difference may be due to the limited volume of the hydrogel and
also to the different incubation step (microwave vs oven). Furthermore,
the Mann–Whitney U test (for the hydrogel digestion experiments
performed via microwave and oven) and Kruskal–Wallis test (for
all the digestions carried out using the 1 mm rat brain tissue sections)
were applied to the number of protein groups and the number of distinct
peptides in order to find possible statistical differences between
groups. Significant difference was found only for the number of distinct
peptides within the comparison microwave/oven (p <
0.05).

Figure 5 Number of protein groups and of distinct peptides obtained from
the hydrogel experiments carried out via microwave and oven (a) and
from the experiments performed on the 1 mm diameter rat brain tissue
sections from thalamic region (b). The results are expressed as mean
± SD (N = 3). Data are averaged from N = 3 replicated experiments per class. An asterisk denotes
statistically significance among the comparison performed.

Conclusions
We have developed a
method to significantly speed up on-tissue
protein digestion by applying microwave irradiation for 2 min. This
method was demonstrated to provide histology-directed analysis at
resolutions down to 1 mm diameter that are precisely placed on defined
regions, localizing the digestion to a defined area of the tissue.
The reliability and reproducibility of the microwave assisted digestion
has been demonstrated by the comparison of the number of identified
proteins and other data from the LC-MS/MS experiments. This study
demonstrates that a rapid and reliable protein identification strategy
can be performed on a single tissue section while preserving the inherent
spatial information on the tissue. This is of primary importance when
the amount of material (tissue biopsy) is often not enough for proteomics
as well as for all the other analysis that are usually carried out
on a biopsy for clinical investigations. In contrast, the conventional
tissue homogenization and digestion procedures are slower, more time-consuming
and have a significantly higher number of steps. This often results
in the need for a higher amount of starting material because of sample
loss resulting from handling of the tissue. Moving forward, the hydrogel
discs fabrication can be optimized for different dimensions, according
to tissue regions of interest. Future work will also include optimization
of the hydrogel methodology for multiple enzymes experiment as well
as for intact protein analyses. Furthermore, we will continue the
development of fabrication methods to further the use of hydrogel
mediated digestion to smaller tissue areas. Taken together, these
results suggest the possible clinical utility of histology-directed
protein digestion approach.
