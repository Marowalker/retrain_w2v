A targeted
ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass
spectrometry with electrospray ionization (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) method
has been developed for the quantification of tryptophan and its downstream
metabolites from the kynurenine and serotonin pathways. The assay
coverage also includes markers of gut health and inflammation, including
citrulline and neopterin. The method was designed in 96-well plate
format for application in multiday, multiplate clinical and epidemiology
population studies. A chromatographic cycle time of 7 min enables
the analysis of two 96-well plates in 24 h. To protect chromatographic
column lifespan, samples underwent a two-step extraction, using solvent
protein precipitation followed by delipidation via solid-phase extraction
(SPE). Analytical validation reported accuracy of each analyte <20%
for the lowest limit of quantification and <15% for all other quality
control (QC) levels. The analytical precision for each analyte was
2.1–12.9%. To test the applicability of the method to multiplate
and multiday preparations, a serum pool underwent periodic repeat
analysis during a run consisting of 18 plates. The % CV (coefficient
of variation) values obtained for each analyte were <15%. Additional
biological testing applied the assay to samples collected from healthy
control participants and two groups diagnosed with inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) (one group treated with the anti-inflammatory 5-aminosalicylic
acid (5-ASA) and one group untreated), with results showing significant
differences in the concentrations of picolinic acid, kynurenine, and
xanthurenic acid. The short analysis time and 96-well plate format
of the assay makes it suitable for high-throughput targeted UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS
metabolomic analysis in large-scale clinical and epidemiological population
studies.

Population
wide metabolic phenotyping
allows for the untargeted discovery of metabolic biomarkers of health
and disease. The use of untargeted mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolite
profiling in large epidemiological cohorts is now widespread.1−5 However, the relative lack of sensitivity of full-scan instrumentation
(QTOF, Orbitrap) compared with tandem MS and the fact that stable
isotope-labeled standards to compensate for matrix effects are seldom
used in screening mode mean that the study design often relies on
the observation of relative fold changes between analytes.

Therefore,
a prudent study design employs untargeted metabolic
profiling to identify potential pathways of interest, followed by
confirmation using a fully quantified approach.6 The greater sensitivity of tandem MS allows for the measurement
of pathway intermediates that are present at low concentrations and
that may not have been detected in the untargeted assays, thereby
enabling greater detail in the reporting of mechanistic changes within
specific pathways.

The biochemical fate of the essential amino
acid tryptophan is
one such pathway. While tryptophan is important for protein synthesis,7 it is also metabolized to a number of bioactive
compounds that function in physiological processes including immunoregulation,8 inflammation,9,10 and neurotransmission.11 Tryptophan has also been identified as a key
metabolite in host-gut microbiome signaling,12 and its bioavailability (and therefore that of its downstream metabolites)
is influenced by the microbial balance within the gut.12

The majority of available tryptophan is
metabolized in mammalian
systems through the kynurenine pathway via the tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase
(TDO) or indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) enzymes (Figure S1). Downstream, this pathway contains many neurologically
active compounds including kynurenic acid,13 quinolinic acid,14 and 3-hydroxykynurenine
(3-HK),13 with quinolinic acid reported
as having neurotoxic properties in the central nervous system (CNS).14,15 A secondary metabolic pathway leads to the production of the neurotransmitter
serotonin.11 Dysregulation of the kynurenine
metabolic route has been reported in multiple neurological conditions
including dementia,16−18 depression,19−21 schizophrenia,22,23 and anorexia.24

Conditions of gut
dysfunction including irritable bowel syndrome
(IBS),25,26 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),27,28 gut dysfunction linked acute pancreatitis,29,30 and environmental enteric dysfunction and enteric infections31−33 have also been reported to be associated with changes in concentrations
of metabolites in the kynurenine pathway. As such, it is also important
to measure additional biomarkers of gut health and systemic inflammation;
for example, citrulline is indicative of enterocyte mass reduction
and is observed to decrease with various villus atrophy syndromes.34 Additionally, neopterin is an inflammatory mediator
with circulating concentrations elevated in many conditions when the
cellular immune system is activated.35,36 A comprehensive
review of the metabolism and role of kynurenines in health and disease
has been published by Cervenka et al.9

Tryptophan and its metabolites have previously been quantified
using LC-UV37 and LC-MS/MS.28,38−44 However, existing methodology either has been applied to relatively
small studies (<20 individuals) for biological validation28,40,41,43 or has only focused on the major metabolites such as kynurenine
and tryptophan.37,39,42 Because of the rise in molecular phenomics in epidemiology, metabolite
analysis is increasingly being applied to large population cohorts,1,45 and therefore the methodology presented here was designed to be
sufficiently stable to allow for multiday and multibatch preparations.
A 96-well plate format was advantageous for this purpose, whereas
previous methods have typically performed sample preparation in individual
plastic sample tubes.38,39,43 The resulting method was demonstrated to be stable over a multiday
run consisting of 18 plates.

As a proof of concept, the method
was subsequently applied to a
sample set consisting of healthy controls and two groups of participants
diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC), a subtype of IBD. One IBD
group was untreated, while the second was treated with the anti-inflammatory
5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). The sample set was considered as appropriate
for method testing as variations in the concentration of serum tryptophan
have been previously associated with subtypes of IBD including both
UC and Crohn’s disease.27,28

Analytical
Protocol
Preparation of Standard and Quality Control Diluent
Two diluents were prepared for use in the preparation of calibration
and quality control (QC) stocks. Diluent-D1 consisted of water with
1 mg/mL (0.1%) citric acid, and diluent-D2 consisted of water with
0.1 mg/mL (0.01%) citric acid.

Standard Parent Stock Solution
Preparation
Stock solutions
(1 mg/mL) for 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA), nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), citrulline, dopamine, picolinic
acid, serotonin, quinolinic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), nicotinic
acid, kynurenine, β-nicotinamide mononucleotide (βNM),

acid (3-HAA), indole-3-acetic acid (I-3-AA), and kynurenic acid were
dissolved in 60% 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 40% diluent-D1.
A 1 mg/mL stock solution of neopterin was prepared using 100% dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO).

Dilution of Calibration Standards and Quality
Control Standards
Parent 1 mg/mL stock solutions were diluted
into two duplicate
solutions using diluent-D2 as presented in Tables S1 and S2 to produce suitable calibration and QC ranges for
each target analyte. The final concentration ranges for each target
analyte are presented in Table S3.

Preparation
of Stable Isotope-Labeled Stock Solutions
Stock solutions
(1 mg/mL) for 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid-D5 (5-HIAA-D5), citrulline-D4, dopamine-D4, picolinic
acid-D3, quinolinic acid-D3, 3-hydroxykynurenine-13C2-15N (3-HK-13C2-15N), nicotinic acid-D4, kynurenine-D4, tryptophan-D5, and nicotinamide

A 1 mg/mL stock solution of neopterin-13C5 was prepared using 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The internal
standard (IS) working solution was prepared using the dilution sequence
presented in Table S4.

Plasma and
Serum Sample Extraction and Preparation
For the assay validation,
human plasma and serum samples were purchased
from Seralabs (now BioIVT, West Sussex, U.K.). Six samples (3 male,
3 female) were purchased for both plasma and serum. The plasma and
serum samples were obtained from different groups of individual donors.
Pooled human plasma and serum samples (60 individuals: 30 male, 30
female) used in the validation were also purchased from Seralabs (BioIVT).
Again, plasma and serum donors were from different groups.

Human
plasma and serum samples were left to thaw at 4 °C and then vortex-mixed.
An aliquot (30 μL) of each sample, calibration standard, quality
control, and blank was transferred to a 600 μL Eppendorf 96-well
plate (Figure S2), and 10 μL of internal
standard working solution was added to each well containing sample,
calibration standard, quality control, and single blank wells but
not to double blank wells.

Protein and phospholipid removal
was performed using solvent precipitation
in combination with a pass through a 96-well Phenomenex PHREE SPE
plate (Phenomenex, Macclesfield, U.K.). Prior to use, the PHREE SPE
plates were prewashed using 250 μL of methanol containing 10
mM ammonium formate added to each well, with elution to waste by centrifugation
at 500g for 5 min.

Methanol (250 μL)
containing 10 mM ammonium formate was added
to each well in the analytical plate. The analytical plates were then
foil-capped, vortex-mixed, and briefly centrifuged (500g for 30 s at 20 °C) to ensure that the precipitated samples
were at the bottom of the wells. Following this, the total content
of the analytical plate wells were pipet-mixed using a multichannel
pipet and transferred to the prewashed PHREE SPE plate.

Samples
were drawn through the PHREE plate into a fresh collection
plate (700 μL high-recovery plate, Waters, Wilmslow, U.K.) via
centrifugation at 500g for 5 min. The PHREE plate
was then washed with a further 250 μL of methanol containing
10 mM ammonium formate and eluted into the same high-recovery collection
plate by centrifugation at 500g for 5 min.

The collection plate was then taken to dryness under a low-flow
stream of nitrogen overnight. Dry extracts were resuspended in 40
μL of water containing 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.5% formic
acid. Five μL of each well was injected onto the UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS
system for analysis.

UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS Analysis
The LC
instrument setup consisted
of a Waters Acquity UHPLC solvent management system and a Waters 2777C
external autosampler (Waters, Wilmslow, U.K.). Chromatographic separation
was performed with a Waters HSS T3 2.1 × 150 mm, 1.8 μm
column (Waters, Wilmslow, U.K.). The mobile phase was composed of
0.1% formic acid in water (v/v) (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile
(v/v) (B). The column temperature was maintained at 45 °C, and
linear gradient elution was performed at 0.6 mL/min starting at 1%
B increasing to 10% B over 3 min, then increasing to 90% B at 4 min,
and finally returning to 1% B at 4.1 min for column reequilibration,
which was completed at 5 min. The weak and the strong washes were
95:5 water/acetonitrile (0.2% formic acid) (v/v) and 100% isopropanol
(0.5% formic acid), respectively. During method development, significant
carryover was observed, so an extensive needle wash cycle was employed,
increasing the overall run time to 7 min per injection.

MS detection
was performed with a Waters Xevo TQ-S tandem quadrupole instrument
(Waters, Wilmslow, U.K.) using electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive
ion mode, except for the analysis of tryptophan, which was collected
using negative ESI. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was used for
the quantification of each compound; the specific metabolite transitions
are presented in Table 1. The MS conditions for each analyte were determined via direct infusion
of individual standard solutions.

Nitrogen was used as the desolvation
gas, and argon was used as
the collision gas. The following generic source conditions were used
in positive ionization mode: capillary voltage, 2.5 kV; source offset,
30 V; desolvation temperature, 600 °C; source temperature, 150
°C, desolvation gas flow, 1000 L/h; cone gas flow, 150 L/h; nebulizer
gas, 7.0 bar; collision gas, 0.15 mL/min. For the analysis of tryptophan
in negative ionization mode, the capillary voltage was changed to
0.25 kV, while the remaining parameters were the same as those detailed
for positive ionization mode. Compound-specific parameters are detailed
in Table 1.

Data Processing
Raw UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS spectral data were
processed using TargetLynx application package within MassLynx (v4.1)
software (Waters Corporation). Further statistical analysis was performed
within R (v3.5.1) run in RStudio (v1.1.456).

Method Validation
As far as practical, the method validation
was based on “Bioanalytical method validation—Guidance
for industry” by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).46

Linear Range
Suitable calibration
ranges were selected
based upon analysis of a pooled sample of plasma and adjusted accordingly.
For each analyte that used a SIL internal standard, or surrogate SIL
internal standard, peak area response ratios were calculated and plotted
against the nominal concentration. A linear fit was employed, and
a 1/X2 weighting factor was applied. This
was repeated for three separate days of the validation to assess linearity.

Lower Limit of Quantification
Lower limit of quantification
(LLOQ) values were accepted based on an analytical precision cutoff
of a 20% relative standard deviation rather than signal-to-noise (as
discussed in ref (47)). The LLOQ also had to pass the carryover criteria described below.

Intra- and Interday Accuracy and Precision
For intraday
assay precision, calibration standards were prepared alongside six
replicate QC samples. Different QC concentrations were prepared for
each analyte (Table S6), ranging from the
LLOQ to the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ). For acceptance,
67% of QCs (50% at each level) were required to be within 15% (LLOQ
20%) of their nominal concentration. For interday precision, this
was repeated on three separate days.

Carryover
Carryover
was assessed by analyzing diluent
that had been through the extraction procedure and did not contain
either standards or SIL internal standards (termed “double
blank”) directly after an ULOQ calibration standard. Carryover
acceptance criteria required a MS MRM transition response in the double
blank of ≤20% of the MRM transition response from the LLOQ
standards. Carryover for the SIL internal standards was accepted if
the MRM transition response in the double blank was ≤5% of
the response seen from an injection of the SIL internal standards
mixture (see Table S4).

Stability
Stability was assessed using QC standards
prepared in the diluent described earlier. Quantification of the samples
and subsequent stability assessment was made following sample storage
at 24 h at 4 °C in the autosampler, in addition to being stored
at −20 °C for 1 and 2 weeks. This was repeated with a
low and high QC (QC 2 and QC 6).

Analytical Recovery
Because the method is for endogenous
metabolites, a true analyte-free matrix is unavailable; therefore,
recovery from analytical samples was estimated using the SIL internal
standard compounds. To assess the extraction recovery, SIL internal
standards were spiked into matrix both before and after extraction
via the protein precipitation/SPE approach. This was repeated six
times, with six different sources of biofluid.

Analyte/Blank
Matrix Interferences
Interferences between
target analytes and the blank matrix were assessed by analyzing six
double blanks and inspecting the responses within the spectral windows
of the analytes and comparing these with mean analyte responses in
LLOQ calibration standards. For acceptance, a minimum of five double
blanks had to be <20% of the LLOQ signal.

Matrix Signal Effects
Because a true analyte-free matrix
is unavailable, matrix effects (ion suppression/enhancement) were
evaluated using SIL internal standards spiked into both double blank
samples and pooled development plasma samples after extraction through
the SPE plate.

Biological Sample Testing
Long-Term
Multiday Assay Performance Testing
To assess
multiplate assay performance and reproducibility, a pool of serum
was analyzed after every 10th injection during an analytical run that
consisted of 18 plates of serum samples prepared according to the
plate layout shown in Figure S2. Data were
acquired over 9 days, with a total of 92 injections of the serum pool
analyzed in this way. For large multiplate, multiday studies such
as this, two sample plates were prepared (Figure S2) and analyzed in each 24 h time period.

Application
of the Assay to Clinical Samples
Sample Collection Information
The study was approved
by the London Northwest NHS trust and National Research Ethics Service
(REC no. 14/EM/1290). Plasma samples were obtained from 29 study participants.
Ten participants were controls and had no clinical diagnosis of UC
(8 male, 2 female, age 29–35, mean age = 33.0), 9 participants
had a clinical diagnosis of UC and were not undergoing treatment (5
male, 4 female, age 21–71, mean age = 40.6), and 10 participants
with a clinical diagnosis of UC were undergoing treatment with the
anti-inflammatory 5-ASA (8 male, 2 female, age 20–71, mean
age = 46.2).

Blood was taken from fasting subjects in heparin
bottles (Vacutainer Plus Venous Blood Collection Heparin Tube) and
centrifuged at 1 000g and 4 °C for 10 min immediately
after collection. Plasma was then aliquoted into labeled tubes (Eppendorf
2 mL), ensuring that no red blood cells or clots were carried over.
All samples were then immediately frozen and stored in −20
°C freezers for a maximum of 24 h before transfer to a −80
°C freezer.

Samples were randomized, aliquoted, extracted,
and analyzed using
the protocol described above. Biological samples were analyzed as
a set of 40. Each sample set was preceded by a calibration standard
set and a full set of analytical QC standards, at LLOQ, low, mid,
high, and ULOQ concentrations for each of the respective analytes
(QC concentrations are listed in Table S3). The calibration and analytical QC set was repeated at the end
of each plate (Figure S2). An additional
repeat of each analytical QC concentration (Table S3) was included and analyzed after every 10th injection throughout
the acquisition sequence to ensure calibration and quantification
performance across the run.

A biological QC was prepared by
mixing equal volumes (10 μL)
from each study sample into a homogeneous pool; this approach was
adapted from previous traditional use in nontargeted metabolomics48 and was included in the protocol to demonstrate
and monitor the precision of quantification of each analyte in a repeat
analysis of a biological sample. The biological QC was analyzed at
intervals of 10 samples throughout the run to further monitor assay
performance for biological samples.

Results and Discussion
The described assay enables the rapid and reproducible quantification
of a panel of metabolites associated with gut health and tryptophan
metabolism via the kynurenine and serotonin pathways. The limitations
of LC-MS-based assays for the quantification of analytes in complex
matrixes such as plasma/serum resulting from so-called matrix effects
are well-known.49−51 To some extent such effects can be compensated for
by the use of an appropriate SIL internal standard; while this approach
is not perfect, it is preferable to the use of surrogate or external
standards. We have therefore attempted to match each of the analytes
in this method with a suitable SIL with tryptophan and 14 of its metabolites
covered in this way. Two further targeted metabolites, βNM and
serotonin used neopterin-13C5 and dopamine-D4 as surrogate internal standards to enable at least semiquantification.
The remaining targeted analyte (NAD+) was included in the
assay for nonquantitative “fold change” monitoring without
internal standard correction. A 96-well plate approach, incorporating
an extensive sample cleanup, with a two-step extraction using solvent
protein precipitation followed by delipidation via SPE (developed
to protect chromatographic column lifespan) combined with a 4.2 min
chromatographic separation (Figure 1) was designed for application in high-throughput analysis
of the target analytes in clinical population cohorts.

3-HAA; 14, tryptophan; 15, xanthurenic acid; 16, kynurenic acid; 17,
5-HIAA; 18, indole-3-acetic acid. *NAD+ was not considered for quantification;
it was monitored only.

The separation was stable and reproducible, as evidenced
by intrabatch
retention time CVs of <0.7% across six replicate injections of
ULOQ analytical QC samples. Comparison of retention times between
two different columns and LC solvent batches showed differences of
<0.1 min for all analytes.

For selective detection, MRM transitions
were developed for each
metabolite and SIL internal standard as listed in Table 1. Where possible, the losses
of 18 and 44 (water and CO2) were excluded to obtain unique
transitions; this was to avoid cross-contamination from these common
losses. In the absence of an analyte-free plasma or serum, water was
used as the blank matrix for the preparation of calibration and analytical
QC samples. Water was selected as the diluent because it makes minimal
assumptions when used as a blank matrix. It is an accepted approach
in such situations (see review by Thakare et al.52) that has previously been used in endogenous metabolite
quantification.53,54 The method underwent validation
and application to a human clinical study containing cases of inflammatory
bowel disease to ensure compatibility with the physiological and pathological
variation of tryptophan metabolite concentrations.

Method Validation
Analytical
Specificity
The MRM transition window for
each metabolite and the corresponding SIL internal standard was assessed
for analyte MRM transition specificity. Biological samples (both serum
and plasma) were extracted and analyzed using the LC-MS conditions
described earlier. For 14 of the analytes, there was no chromatographic
coelution of interferences in the MRM transition window. While nicotinic
and picolinic acids shared the same quantification transition (124.1
→ 78.1), they were fully resolved chromatographically. Qualifier
transition ions for every metabolite in the assay were also included
in the method to help ensure that the correct chromatographic peak
was assigned to each metabolite in the biological samples. Nicotinic
acid has a qualification transition (124.1 → 53.1) that was
not shared by picolinic acid. Additionally, the MRM transition window
for xanthurenic acid (206.1 → 132.1) contained a peak for the
naturally occurring 13C second isotope of tryptophan; again,
these were chromatographically resolved with no interference between
these analytes, as can be observed in Figure 1.

Analytical Range and Linearity
Analytical
ranges were
determined either by the LLOQ achievable by the extraction and analytical
setup or by analysis of biological samples and subsequent adjustment
of the ranges. Calibration curves were found to be linear (>0.990)
over the selected ranges described in Table S5.

A challenge for the method development was that the quantified
metabolites are present at very different concentrations to one another
and therefore require appropriate linear ranges of the standards to
achieve quantification, challenging the linear dynamic range of the
instrument. For example, serum neopterin has previously been reported
at concentrations 10 000 times lower than that of serum tryptophan.55 Therefore, in this assay neopterin was validated
at a range of 0.2–20 ng/mL, while tryptophan was validated
over a range of 200–20 000 ng/mL. However,
the high ULOQ concentration required for the analysis of tryptophan
initially resulted in a nonlinear response, caused by in-source ionization
saturation. This was overcome using fast polarity switching and determining
the analyte using negative ESI. All metabolites, except for tryptophan,
were analyzed using positive ESI and were tuned for maximum sensitivity
across the linear range. However, tryptophan and its SIL internal
standard were analyzed with a low capillary voltage (0.25 kV). This
had an effect of detuning the tryptophan transition for sensitivity
with the benefit of negating the effect of in-source saturation, resulting
in linearity of the calibration over the desired range (Figure S3).

The results of the intraday
and interday precision and accuracy
of the assay are presented in Table S6.
All metabolites demonstrated an analytical accuracy <15% (LLOQ
< 20%). The intra- and interday precision of the assay ranged from
1.3% to 15.4% for the intraday determinations and 2.1–12.9%
for the interday comparison.

Carryover
All target metabolites
demonstrated minimal
carryover (<1.1%). Carryover for internal standards was 0.1–2.8%.

Stability
During method development, poor stability
of some metabolites in aqueous solutions was observed. Previously
the literature has reported that metabolites in the kynurenine pathway
undergo rapid oxidation in aqueous solutions.56−59 To overcome this instability,
stock calibration standards and quality control standards were prepared
using 0.1% citric acid in water, and subsequent dilutions were prepared
with 0.01% citric acid in water. Citric acid, in excess, acts as an
antioxidant and a preservative in solution.

Standards prepared
in citric acid were assessed for stability after 24 h at 4 °C
in an autosampler and at both 1 and 2 weeks at −20 °C.
This was repeated with a low and a high QC (QC 2 and QC 6). The QC
samples that underwent quantification after storage reported acceptable
stability of >97% for the high QC for all metabolites and >90%
in
the low QC. The exception was picolinic acid, where stability was
90.74% after 1 week and 83.33% after 2 weeks. The results obtained
for this metabolite must therefore be interpreted with caution if
the analysis of samples is significantly delayed following collection.
Full results are presented in Table S7.
Twenty-four h autosampler stability was chosen as a key time period
for stability assessment because in large multiplate, multiday studies
that the assay was designed for two sample plates underwent extraction
and analysis in each 24 h time period.

Analytical Recovery
Plasma metabolite recoveries were
typically >90%, with only dopamine-D4 (83%), quinolinic
acid-D3 (80%), and nicotinamide riboside-D3 (53%)
being the exceptions. Serum metabolite recoveries were typically >85%,
with quinolinic acid-D3 (79%) and nicotinamide riboside-D3 (52%) being the exceptions (Tables S8 and S9).

Matrix Effects
Observed matrix effects
were minimal
for most metabolites in both serum and plasma, with results suggesting
a matrix area response of 77–112% when comparing SIL standards
spiked into either plasma or serum with the response of SIL standards
spiked into a blank diluent (Table S10).
The exception in both biofluids was citrulline. The MRM transition
responses for the SIL internal standard of citrulline spiked into,
and extracted from, both plasma and serum were 23.5% and 18.4%, respectively,
when compared with the values for the spiked diluent blank. It is
likely that the observed matrix effects were due to the short retention
time of citrulline and its SIL internal standard. However, the inclusion
of the SIL analogue as an internal standard in the assay protocol
should compensate for these matrix effects when quantifying citrulline
in these biofluids.

Biological Sample Testing
Long-Term Multiday
Assay Performance Testing
Following
multiday analysis of serum, metabolite concentrations from pooled
biological QCs were calculated. Three analytes (3-HAA, βNM,
and dopamine) were found to be below the LLOQ in the pooled serum.
However, for the remaining detectable analytes, the % CV values ranged
from 2.8% to 20.0%. All analytes in the range had CV values of <15%
except for nicotinamide riboside, which had a % CV of 20%. This result
shows the methods reproducibility across multiplate analysis, therefore
highlighting its applicability to the large-scale profiling and quantified
analysis of the analyte panel in both clinical research and epidemiology
studies. Data for each analyte are presented in Table S11.

It should be noted that the quality acceptance
criteria for each metabolite in an analysis is based only upon the
calibration samples and analytical QCs. The biological QCs are used
to demonstrate the precision of quantification for individual analytes
over the duration of a study. In a clinical study, the overall distribution
of one or more metabolites may be below the LLOQ, with only a few
study samples having values above the LLOQ. Therefore, when samples
are pooled to create the biological QC, metabolite concentrations
may result that are below the assay LLOQ for these analytes. In this
instance, biological QCs will not provide useful information on the
precision of measurement of these analytes in biological samples.

Application of the Assay to Clinical Samples
Following
analytical validation, the method was then tested in clinical samples
obtained from two groups of participants diagnosed with UC (treated
and untreated) and a control group in order to show clinical application
in a “proof of concept” study. IBD is a broad clinical
classification that includes both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative
colitis (UC). IBD is characterized by chronic inflammation within
the colon and the small intestine.60 The
pathogenesis of the condition has not been fully elucidated and is
thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors.60 In addition, evidence suggests that the equilibrium
between gut microbial composition and host immune response at the
mucosal layer plays a role in the disease.60−62

The concentration
of tryptophan in the circulatory system is regulated by both bioavailability
in diet and subsequent metabolism by microbial colonies that are present
in the gut.12 The assay was applied to
plasma samples from a subset of study participants diagnosed with
UC, to investigate metabolic differences reflective of their gut health.
The samples were obtained from subjects from three groups including
controls with no diagnosis of UC or IBD, participants with a clinical
diagnosis of UC who are not undergoing treatment, and participants
with a clinical diagnosis of UC who are being treated with 5-ASA,
prescribed to help reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms.

A biological QC was created by pooling equal volumes of all samples
from the study. This biological QC was then analyzed at intervals
of 10 samples across the analytical run to determine the variation
in the extraction. The CVs for the calculated concentration values
of analytes that fell within the range of quantification in the biological
QC were <10% (Table S12).

Following
data acquisition and postacquisition processing, the
groups were assessed for significant differences using a one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) test. ANOVA was performed on those metabolites,
which were detected and quantified within the calibration range, as
well as the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio. The ANOVA analysis demonstrated
significant differences between the three patient classes for the
metabolites picolinic acid (p = 0.009), xanthurenic
acid (p = 0.017), and kynurenine (p = 0.043). However, when controlling for the family-wise error rate
using the Bonferroni method to adjust for multiple testing, adjusted p values for each of the metabolites were as follows: picolinic
acid (adjusted p = 0.130), xanthurenic acid (adjusted p = 0.250), and kynurenine (adjusted p =
0.643). Metabolite concentrations for picolinic acid, xanthurenic
acid, and kynurenine underwent Tukey HSD testing within each ANOVA,
with kynurenine, xanthurenic acid, and picolinic acid demonstrating
statistically significant intergroup differences (discussed below).

A statistically significant increase in kynurenine concentration
was observed in UC treated (p = 0.042) and untreated
(p = 0.16) patient groups compared with the control
group (Figure 2). This
supports previous literature where kynurenine was reported at increased
concentrations in the serum of clinical cases of IBD patients (UC
= 7, Crohn’s disease = 5) compared to a control group (n = 12).63 However, it should
be noted that this previous study also reported a statistically significant
increase in kynurenic acid concentrations in the IBD groups,63 which was not replicated in the present study,
where only a nonsignificant decrease for kynurenic acid was observed
in the clinical UC cases (both treated and untreated) compared with
the control group (ANOVA, p = 0.674).

Figure 2 Box plots presenting
three analytes that significantly differ in
concentrations between the study groups. The upper box plots show
the full analytical range with the lower limit of quantification in
blue and the upper limit of concentration in red. The lower box plots
present the same data, but the y-axis has been shrunk
for clarity. ANOVA analysis revealed significant differences between
the control and patient groups for kynurenine (p =
0.043), picolinic acid (p = 0.009), and xanthurenic
acid (p = 0.017). Data for the biological QC have
been included to show the measurement precision of each metabolite
in a repeat biological sample, compared with the variation within
the clinical samples.

The same paper also reported a nonsignificant decrease of
xanthurenic
acid in the IBD groups compared to the control group.63 This previous finding is supported by our study, with both
untreated UC and treated UC groups showing a statistically significant
decrease in the concentration compared to the control group (control
→ UC treated p = 0.161, control → IBD
untreated p = 0.013).

For picolinic acid, untreated
UC and treated UC groups showed a
decrease in concentration compared with controls (control →
UC treated p = 0.060, control → UC untreated p = 0.009). Previously, a reduction in serum picolinic acid
in Crohn’s disease had been reported; however, there was no
significant change in UC.28

It should
be noted that the picolinic acid analytical standards
showed signs of long-term instability in solution (83.3% after 2 weeks
at −20 °C). However, the data from pooled biological QC
samples show stable and reproducible biological measurements of picolinic
acid for the duration of a 9-day, 18-plate analysis (Table S11). This demonstrates that the method is fit for its
purpose in identifying concentration changes between groups in a study
that is discovery in design. Despite this, if increased confidence
in the concentration of endogenous picolinic acid quantification is
required, we would recommend further investigation and optimization
of all stages of sample collection, treatment, and long-term storage
for the analyte.

The limitation of the proof of concept UC data
set analyzed here
is the relatively small number of samples without adjustment for clinical
confounders. However, despite these limitations, the results do show
a graded difference in pairwise comparisons between untreated, treated,
and control groups.

Conclusions
A UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS method
for the analysis of 18 metabolites linked
to gut health and tryptophan metabolism has been developed for application
to human plasma and serum. The method was designed to use a 96-well
plate format to facilitate multiple-day, large-batch analysis of samples
enabling its application to large-scale clinical and epidemiology-based
population studies. The method employed a two-step extraction, using
solvent protein precipitation followed by delipidation via SPE. Extracted
analytes then underwent chromatographic separation using a 4.2 min
reversed-phase gradient (7 min total cycle time). The assay was validated
and applied to a clinical study of UC using plasma samples obtained
from controls and both untreated and treated patients. Reduced amounts
of picolinic acid and xanthurenic acid and increased quantities of
kynurenine were observed in the plasma of patients with UC using this
approach.
