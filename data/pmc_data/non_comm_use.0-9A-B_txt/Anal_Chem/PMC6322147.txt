Real-time,
isothermal, digital nucleic acid amplification is emerging
as an attractive approach for a multitude of applications including
diagnostics, mechanistic studies, and assay optimization. Unfortunately,
there is no commercially available and affordable real-time, digital
instrument validated for isothermal amplification; thus, most researchers
have not been able to apply digital, real-time approaches to isothermal
amplification. Here, we generate an approach to real-time digital
loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) using commercially available
microfluidic chips and reagents and open-source components. We demonstrate
this approach by testing variables that influence LAMP reaction speed
and the probability of detection. By analyzing the interplay of amplification
efficiency, background, and speed of amplification, this real-time
digital method enabled us to test enzymatic performance over a range
of temperatures, generating high-precision kinetic and end-point measurements.
We were able to identify the unique optimal temperature for two polymerase
enzymes while accounting for amplification efficiency, nonspecific
background, and time to threshold. We validated this digital LAMP
assay and pipeline by performing a phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility
test on 17 archived clinical urine samples from patients diagnosed
with urinary tract infections. We provide all the necessary workflows
to perform digital LAMP using standard laboratory equipment and commercially
available materials. This real-time digital approach will be useful
to others in the future to understand the fundamentals of isothermal
chemistries, including which components determine amplification fate,
reaction speed, and enzymatic performance. Researchers can also adapt
this pipeline, which uses only standard equipment and commercial components,
to quickly study and optimize assays using precise, real-time digital
quantification, accelerating development of critically needed diagnostics.

==== Body
In this paper,
we describe a
methodology to use commercially available chips, reagents, and microscopes
to perform real-time digital LAMP. We use this methodology to perform
a mechanistic study of digital isothermal amplification and apply
the lessons learned to perform a phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility
test (AST).

Microfluidics-based diagnostics for infectious diseases
are advancing
as a result of using nucleic acid testing, making them amenable to
the point of care (POC) and limited-resource settings where they will
have clinical impact. Isothermal amplification methods in particular
show promise for simplifying nucleic acid-based POC diagnostics by
circumventing the stringent thermal cycling requirements of PCR.1 One isothermal method that is being actively
pursued in bioanalytical chemistry and the field of diagnostics is
loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP).2−6

LAMP and other isothermal technologies are
fast and sensitive,
but when performed in a bulk format in microliter volumes (e.g., in
a tube), they provide only semiquantitative (log-scale) resolution
or presence/absence measurements.7−15 As a result, when optimizing an assay, it is difficult to quantify
how small changes in assay conditions (e.g., in primers, reagents,
or temperature) impact the reaction’s speed and analytical
sensitivity. To reliably understand these effects with high precision
would require hundreds of bulk experiments per condition.16 For the field to be able to take full advantage
of the capabilities of LAMP, researchers need to be able to optimize
reaction conditions by understanding and testing the variables that
may influence reaction speed and probability of detection. Furthermore,
the semiquantitative measurements yielded by bulk isothermal methods
are insufficient for analyses requiring precise quantification, such
as phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility testing.17,18

These problems can be solved using “digital”
approaches,
which partition single target molecules in large numbers of compartments
and give a binary (presence/absence) readout for each compartment.
These “digital” approaches thus allow determination
of the efficiency of the amplification reaction19 and provide absolute quantification with high resolution.
Digital isothermal measurements have been used to quantify viral load
for HCV,16,20,21 HIV,19,20 and influenza,22 perform bacterial enumeration,23−25 optimize primers,16 and test for phenotypic
antibiotic susceptibility18 using LAMP18−28 and RPA.29

Real-time digital formats
are especially valuable for examining
the variables that most affect nonspecific amplification and the speed
of amplification. Many excellent approaches for end-point19,20,22−28 and real-time16,18,21 digital LAMP (dLAMP) have been published. Despite the value that
real-time dLAMP can bring to diagnostics, this method is difficult
to implement, especially for those without a background in microelectromechanical
systems or microfluidics, because there is no commercial system for
real-time, digital isothermal amplification. To achieve statistical
significance, a meaningful study might require dozens of experiments;
such studies are difficult to perform without a commercial source
of chips. Consequently, the few LAMP mechanistic studies that have
been performed were not done with high precision. Further, those who
would most benefit from optimized digital isothermal reactions (e.g.,
those working on POC diagnostics) cannot efficiently improve them.

Here, we demonstrate how to generate high-precision kinetic and
end-point measurements using a real-time dLAMP assay that is performed
completely with commercially available and open-source components
(Figure 1). We use
this real-time information to investigate dLAMP reactions mechanistically,
including the interplay of efficiency, speed, and background amplification
as a function of reaction temperature and time on two enzymes. To
illustrate one application of using real-time dLAMP to improve a clinically
relevant assay, we optimized the assay conditions for a phenotypic
AST using the real-time dLAMP pipeline and used the optimized protocol
to compare our AST of 17 clinical urine samples to the gold-standard
method.

(e.g., primers, enzymes, buffer composition) can be purchased commercially.
Multiple instrument configurations can be used to capture results,
e.g., a customized real-time instrument (instructions for building
publicly available30) or any commercial
microscope. Data analysis is automated using a MATLAB script (Supporting

LAMP Reagents
Our amplification target was the Escherichia coli 23S ribosomal gene, which we used
previously as a target to perform rapid AST on clinical samples.18 Primers were purchased through Integrated DNA
Technologies (San Diego, CA, USA) and were described previously.18 Final primer concentrations were identical for
all experiments: 1.6 μM FIP/BIP, 0.2 μM FOP/BOP, and 0.4
μM LoopF/LoopB.

Figure 4 Phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility tests of 17 clinical
urine
samples from patients infected with a urinary tract infection containing E. coli. Susceptibility to the antibiotics nitrofurantoin
and ciprofloxacin were tested using dLAMP conditions optimized using
digital real-time experiments (Figure 3). Urine samples were exposed to media without antibiotic
(control) or media with an antibiotic (treated) for 15 min, and then
concentrations of nucleic acids were quantified to calculate a control:treated
(C:T) ratio. Samples were categorized by dLAMP as susceptible (above
the susceptibility threshold) or resistant (below the threshold).
All samples were categorized in agreement with the clinical gold-standard
method.

LAMP experiments using Bst 2.0 (Figure 3a,c,e,g) contained the following
final concentrations, optimized as shown in Supporting Information, Figure S3: 1× Isothermal Amplification Buffer
(New England BioLabs; ref B0537S, containing 20 mM Tris-HCl 10 mM
(NH4)2SO4, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1% Tween 20 pH 8.8 at 25 °C), additional 6 mM MgSO4 (New England BioLabs; ref B1003S), 1.4 mM Deoxynucleotide
Solution Mix (New England BioLabs; ref N0447S). Primers: 1.6 μM
FIP/BIP, 0.2 μM FOP/BOP, and 0.4 μM LoopF/LoopB, 1 mg/mL

ref AM2286, 5 U/mL RNase A, 400 U/mL TNase T1), 2 μM SYTO 9
(ThermoFisher, ref S34854), and approximately 660 copies/μL
template in Ambion nuclease-free water (ThermoFisher; ref AM9932).

Template E. coli DNA was extracted
from exponential-phase cultures grown in BBL Brain–Heart Infusion
media (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA; ref 221813) using QuickExtract
DNA Extraction Solution (Lucigen, Middleton, WI, USA; ref QE09050)
as described previously.18 Serial 10-fold
dilutions were prepared in Tris-EDTA buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5 mM
EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 2 U/mL RNase A and 80 U/mL RNase T1 (ThermoFisher;
ref AM2286). DNA dilutions were quantified as described previously18 using the QX200 droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)
system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).

Phenotypic
Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing (AST) on Clinical
Samples
For the phenotypic AST, we adopted a workflow described
previously17,18 and used archived nucleic acid
extractions from a previous study.18 Briefly,
clinical urine samples from patients with urinary tract infections
(UTI) were split and diluted into equal volumes of media with or without
the presence of an antibiotic. Samples were incubated for 15 min at
37 °C, a nucleic acid extraction was performed, and these samples
were archived at −80 °C until use. LAMP was performed
on the archived samples to quantify the number of copies of the E. coli 23S ribosomal gene.

We tested our optimized
assay on 17 archived clinical UTI samples containing ≥5 ×
104 CFU/mL E. coli that
had been categorized previously using the gold-standard broth microdilution
AST (five ciprofloxacin-susceptible, five ciprofloxacin-resistant,
four nitrofurantoin-susceptible, and three nitrofurantoin-resistant).

We assessed samples as phenotypically “resistant”
or “susceptible” by calculating the ratio of the concentration
of 23S in the control and antibiotic-treated sample, which we call
the control:treated (C:T) ratio. The C:T ratio was calculated 10 min
after beginning to heat the LAMP reaction. A threshold of 1.1 was
established previously,17,18 so samples with C:T
ratios >1.1 indicated that there was DNA replication in the untreated
(control) group but not in the antibiotic-treated samples; these samples
were identified as susceptible to the antibiotic. Samples with C:T
ratios of <1.1 indicated that DNA replication occurred in both
the control and antibiotic-treated samples; these samples were identified
as resistant to the antibiotic.

Results and Discussion
Workflow
Summary of Real-Time Digital LAMP
To evaluate
a pipeline for real-time dLAMP experiments, we chose commercially
sourced microfluidic chips sold for end-point digital PCR applications.
The chips consist of an array of 20000 uniform partitions (Figure 1), each 60 μm
in diameter and an estimated 0.75 nL internal volume, which is similar
to the volumes typically used in dLAMP.16,18,20−23,25,26,28 These chips are loaded by pipetting
the sample mixture (in our case containing the LAMP reagents: buffer
components, enzymes, template, and primers) into the plastic “blade”
provided with the chips and dragging the blade at a 70–80°
angle to the chip to load the sample mixture by capillarity. This
is followed by drying and evaporation of the surface layer for 20
s at 40 °C and application of the immersion fluid. Manual loading
requires some skill, although a machine can be purchased to perform
the task; typically, we were able to load ∼18000 out of the
20000 partitions. We performed our evaluation using two different
enzyme mixtures, Bst 2.0 and Bst 3.0. Our amplification target (Figure 1) was the E. coli 23S ribosomal gene that we previously used as a target to perform
rapid AST on clinical samples.18

The instrumentation requirements for real-time isothermal capabilities
include a heater that can hold a stable temperature and optical components
with high spatial resolution that are capable of imaging the fluorescence
intensity of the 20000 individual partitions of the chip over time
(Figure 2a). Here,
we investigated two approaches: using a standard laboratory microscope
(Leicia DMI-6000B), and using the RTAI,30 which is composed of a thermocycler, optical components, a camera,
and a light source.

We generated a custom MATLAB script to analyze
the digital real-time
data (details in Supporting Information, S-I). The software follows the change in fluorescence in individual
partitions over time. From these data, we extracted each partition’s
time to a fluorescence intensity threshold and calculated the bulk
template concentration. In our demonstration, we loaded the acquired
images into FIJI31 as a time-stack series
and manually separated the images of the individual chips to be analyzed
separately. To process each chip’s image stack, we used the
custom MATLAB script that tracks the mean intensity of each partition
over the course of each experiment. This script could be run with
only minor modifications with images obtained from different instruments.

To calculate the bulk template concentration over time, we (1)
identified the partitions that did or did not contain reaction solution,
(2) tracked the partitions that met a minimum fluorescence intensity,
and (3) used the previous information to calculate the concentration
of template in the bulk solution.

A summary of the script is
as follows: (i) load the images into
memory, (ii) count the total number of partitions before heating,
(iii) identify positive partitions after the conclusion of the experiment,
(iv) track the intensity of positive partitions for each image frame,
(v) apply Gaussian smoothing and baseline subtraction, (vi) save the
data, and (vii) repeat for each image stack. The output of the script
contains: the raw traces of individual partitions over time, baseline
corrected traces of individual partitions over time (Figure 2b), the number of partitions
exceeding the manually defined minimum fluorescence intensity threshold
with time (Figure 2f), and the maximum relative rate in RFU per 30 s for individual
partitions (Figure 2d). These data provide all the necessary information to conduct the
analyses detailed in Figure 2.

Digital, Real-Time Experiments to Quantify LAMP Performance
We next sought to experimentally evaluate this pipeline (Figure 1). First, we established
whether the fluorescence from LAMP reactions could be reliably measured
from individual partitions over time (Figure 2a). We used LAMP reagents for Bst 3.0, commercial chips, a resistive heater held at 70 °C, and
a commercial microscope. Although the microscope is capable of collecting
all 20000 partitions on one chip in a single image, for simplicity,
in Figure 2a, we cropped
the image to include only 350 of the 20000 partitions. Before turning
on the heater (t = 0), we measured the autofluorescence
from SYTO 9 to quantify the total number of partitions loaded with
reaction solution. (To calculate template concentration using the
Poisson distribution,32,33 we must know the total number
of partitions containing the reaction mixture.) Autofluorescence from
SYTO 9 decreases as the chip is heated and is completely eliminated
within 3 min. The heater used on the microscope reaches reaction temperature
within 120 s. In less than 10 min, an increase in fluorescence was
observed within some of the individual partitions, indicating amplification
of individual template molecules inside those partitions. Because
of the stochastic nature of amplification initiation, some of the
partitions fluoresced later.

In the negative-control (no template)
partitions, fluorescence was not observed for the first 45 min. However,
we began to observe nonspecific amplification after ∼60 min.
In these experiments, the negative control contains only 0.05×
Tris-EDTA buffer in place of template and represents a best-case scenario.
We attribute amplification in the absence of template to primer dimers
and other nonspecific LAMP products.

Second, we asked if the
signal from nonspecific amplification was
sufficiently delayed to differentiate it from the signal arising from
specific amplification in the presence of template. To answer this
question, we generated real-time fluorescence curves by plotting the
change in fluorescence of individual partitions as a function of time
(Figure 2b). We observed
specific amplification (blue curves) beginning to initiate at ∼7
min and nonspecific amplification beginning to initiate at ∼50
min (red curves) and concluded that we could discriminate specific
and nonspecific amplification by time.

Third, we asked whether
enzymatic heterogeneity16,21,34 of specific amplification can be quantified
to differentiate specific from nonspecific amplification. We plotted
the maximum change of fluorescence achieved by each partition of the
full chip per 30 s interval (Figure 2d). For the negative-control sample (red bars), we
observed nonspecific amplification following a bimodal distribution
of rates, with a first peak with little to no rate of fluorescence
increase and a second peak at ∼25 RFU per 30 s. For the sample
containing template (blue bars), rates for specific amplification
were heterogeneous and centered around a rate of 70 RFU/30 s. We note
that in PCR, which is gated by temperature cycling, there is no equivalent
concept of “rate” as long as replication of DNA occurs
faster that the duration of each elongation step. We found in our
dLAMP experiments that the rate of specific amplification was greater
than nonspecific amplification. Hence, tracking amplification in real-time
made it possible to distinguish true positives from false positives
(nonspecific amplification).

Fourth, we asked if the distribution
in time to fluorescence threshold
is sufficiently narrow to discriminate specific and nonspecific amplification.
By plotting the number of “on” partitions (i.e., partitions
that crossed the fluorescence intensity threshold defined in Figure 2b) against time,
we generated a distribution curve (Figure 2f) that illustrates the number of partitions
that turn on per time point. This is related to the derivative of
the change in concentration over time. This plot contains the time
to threshold of all partitions within the entire chip, rather than
a subset, to minimize sampling bias. In the sample containing template
(blue curve), most partitions reached the threshold in 7–20
min, whereas the negative-control sample (red curve) had little nonspecific
amplification until approximately 60 min. Graphing time to threshold
(Figure 2f) illustrates
the overall reaction’s speed (defined as the location of the
peak or mode time to threshold) and efficiency (proportional to the
area under the curve and illustrated in Figure 2e as the calculated concentration). In our
experiment, the peak of the sample containing template was narrow
and well separated from the nonspecific amplification of the negative
control (Figure 2f),
indicating sufficiently low heterogeneity in amplification rate and
time to initiation of the reaction.

Fifth, we asked how the
calculated bulk concentration changes over
time. To answer this question, we generated end-point-style measurements
for each 30 s time point and calculated how the concentration changed
over time. To demonstrate how to generate a single end-point-style
measurement, we selected one time point (25 min) and plotted RFU as
a factor of the number of partitions (Figure 2c). Partitions were classified as either
“on” (>250 RFU threshold) or “off”
(<250
RFU threshold). Partitions that are defined as having turned “on”
contain a template molecule that amplified, whereas partitions that
are ”off” either lack a template molecule or have not
yet begun amplification. The sum of the partitions passing the threshold
out of the total number of partitions with solution was used to determine
a precise bulk concentration of template in the sample using the Poisson
equation, as has been documented elsewhere.32,33 We plotted the calculated concentration as it changed over time
in Figure 2e (solid
lines).

When the aim is to determine a precise concentration,
we need to
determine the best time at which to stop the assay. Deciding the best
time to end the assay is complicated because each reaction initiates
stochastically,16,21 causing the calculated concentration
to asymptotically approach the true concentration (Figure 2e). It would be ideal for the
calculated concentration to rapidly rise to the true bulk concentration
and plateau near the true concentration; however, the reaction should
be stopped before the rise in nonspecific amplification (observed
in our example starting at 60 min; red curves, Figure 2e,f). We tested whether there is heterogeneity
in amplification rate (i.e., whether partitions with slow amplification
rates take longer to reach the fluorescence intensity threshold than
partitions with fast amplification rates) and found that initiation
time was stochastic, but the reaction rates for true and false positives
were consistent (Figure 2g). Hence, two molecules could have the same TTP yet initiate at
different moments, resulting in variable amplification rates.

Combining information about the concentration of template (Figure 2e) and the time it
takes for partitions to turn “on” (Figure 2f) can be used to inform the
choice of an optimal assay length for end-point measurements for situations
where real-time quantification is not feasible. For example, in Figure 2, the optimal assay
length for an end-point readout would be ∼45 min. This approach
allows one to balance stochastic initiation of amplification, overcome
enzymatic heterogeneity, and reduce the incidence of false positives
caused by nonspecific amplification.

However, in cases where
real-time measurements are desirable, thresholding
by rate may be used to separate specific and nonspecific amplification.
For example, to correct for the observed increase in nonspecific amplification
(after 45 min), we implemented a threshold (Figure 2d) on the maximum rate per partition, thus
eliminating some of the nonspecific amplification in both the presence
and absence of template (compare solid and dashed lines in Figure 2e). For example,
the measured value at 60 min is 280 copies per μL (solid line),
and the corrected value is 258 copies per μL (dashed line).
In the no-template control, at 60 min, the measured value is 16 copies
per μL (solid line), whereas the corrected value is 3 copies
per μL (dashed line). The correction is more pronounced at 80
min where nonspecific amplification is greater. At 80 min, the measured
value in the presence of template is 325 copies per μL and the
corrected value 266 copies per μL, indicating that almost 20%
of the signal could arise from nonspecific amplification. In the absence
of template, the uncorrected value at 80 min is 187 copies per μL,
however if the rate is accounted for, then the value can be corrected
to 16 copies per μL, thus eliminating the majority of the false
positives.

Finally, we note that although we calculated template
concentration,
the value is precise but could be inaccurate if not all target molecules
loaded into the chip undergo amplification (in other words, if efficiency
of amplification is not 100%). Thus, we next sought to measure the
absolute likelihood of detecting a molecule as a function of reaction
condition.

Evaluation of the Effect of Temperature on
dLAMP with Two Different
Enzymes to Analyze the Interplay of Amplification Efficiency, Background,
and Speed of Amplification
After establishing a protocol
for generating real-time, digital measurements, we evaluated the absolute
amplification efficiency of LAMP as a function of temperature for
two different enzymes. We selected two commercial polymerases that
worked well for us previously. Both enzymes are in silico homologues
on the Bacillus stearothermophilus DNA
polymerase I and large fragment. NEB describes Bst 3.0 as an improvement of Bst 2.0 by adding reverse
transcriptase activity, increased amplification speed, and increased
thermostability. We sought to understand the differences in performance
between these two enzymes at the single-template level. For this experiment,
we used the previously described RTAI.30 The field of view for this instrument is larger than a microscope,
allowing up to six samples to be observed concurrently. Hence, both
the positive and negative controls could be collected in triplicate
simultaneously. We expect some differences in measurements made on
different instruments as a result of differing camera sensitivities
and differences in the heating mechanism. Indeed, when we ran a single-concentration
amplification reaction under identical conditions and compared measurements
from the microscope and the RTAI, we found that there was significant
difference (P = 0.03) in amplification efficiency
between the two instruments (Supporting Information, Figure S2), with the RTAI generating higher amplification
efficiency. Hence, we performed all enzyme–performance comparisons
on a single instrument.

Amplification Efficiency
First,
we sought to establish
the amplification efficiency of dLAMP, i.e., the fraction of template
copies loaded that are detected (Figure 3a,b). We calculated the bulk concentration
of template molecules from the digital measurement and plotted the
observed template concentration as a fraction of template molecules
loaded. To calculate the amplification efficiency, we determined template
concentration using ddPCR and assumed all template molecules were
amplified. Using the real-time component of our measurements, we plotted
the percent of copies detected over time compared with ddPCR.

We next asked how temperature impacts amplification efficiency. In
general, we observed greater amplification efficiency at longer amplification
times, which aligned with our previous observation (Figure 2d,e). Second, when observing
at a fixed time, increasing temperature increased amplification efficiency
to an optimum (green box in Figure 3a,b) before activity decreased.

Several observations
can be made by comparing the results from Bst 2.0
and Bst 3.0 (Figure 3a,b). Although Bst 2.0 and Bst 3.0 have an identical reported optimal incubation temperature
in bulk (65 °C), we observed they had different optimal temperature
ranges for amplification efficiency (Bst 2.0 at 66–68
°C; Bst 3.0 at 68–70 °C). We detected
lower amplification efficiency at higher temperatures with Bst 2.0 compared with Bst 3.0. Bst 2.0 failed to amplify at 72 °C, whereas Bst 3.0 continued amplifying until 76 °C. At short
amplification times, (such as 10 min), Bst 3.0 had
greater amplification efficiency than Bst 2.0 (42.8%
vs 20.8%, respectively). In contrast, at longer amplification times,
such at 30 or 45 min, efficiency for the enzymes was similar (77.6%
vs 71.5% at 45 min, respectively), although Bst 2.0
had slightly greater amplification efficiency than Bst 3.0.

We hypothesize that increased temperature improved amplification
efficiency (presumably by increasing the breathing of dsDNA and facilitating
primer annealing) until, at higher temperatures, a combination of
enzyme denaturation or failure of the primers to anneal occurred.
Our primers had melting temperatures ranging from 56–61 °C,
when excluding the secondary FIP and BIP annealing regions, as calculated
using OligoCalc.35 We found that chip-to-chip
variability was extremely low. Relative error for Bst 2.0 at optimal temperature (68 °C) and 45 min of amplification
was ∼2% (Figure 2a), whereas the predicted Poisson noise for a single chip is 0.7%.
Achieving such high precision using bulk measurements would require
hundreds of experiments. The low variability among these measurements
indicates that we were correctly determining whether a partition contained
solution and whether it amplified.

Nonspecific Background
Amplification
Next, we quantified
the amount of nonspecific amplification (Figure 3c,d) as a function of time and temperature.
We plotted the number of wells that turned “on” in the
absence of template relative to the total number of wells filled with
LAMP solution. As previously stated, these nonspecific amplification
reactions included buffer in place of template and represented a best-case
scenario. We concluded that at least for these idealized conditions,
nonspecific amplification in dLAMP was extremely low. For example,
a fraction of 0.001 could correspond to 20 partitions turning on from
among a total of 20000 possible partitions. For both enzymes, we found
the maximum fraction of nonspecific amplification per total partitions
was 0.0012 for times 20 min or less. The highest fraction of nonspecific
amplification observed was 0.017 at 45 min, corresponding to fewer
than 350 nonspecific partitions of the 20000 total (Figure 3c,d). Furthermore, we observed
that higher temperatures resulted in lower nonspecific amplification
(Figure 3c,d). Finally,
at extremely long amplification times (e.g., 60 min amplification,
data not shown), Bst 2.0 had lower background than Bst 3.0.

Variations in Speed and Amplification Efficiency
Third,
we quantified the variation in speed and amplification efficiency
across partitions in the time to reach fluorescence intensity threshold
(Figure 3e,f). We first
plotted the percent copies detected as a function of time for each
temperature. As described previously, these curves represent the distribution
in the time to threshold across all partitions and thus illustrate
the interplay of (i) detecting a molecule (area under the curve from
zero to a given time corresponding to the values plotted in Figure 3a,b), (ii) the speed
of the reaction (the time at which the peak reaches a maxima), and
(iii) several parameters of peak width summarized in Supporting Information, Table S1. We hypothesize peak width is related
to both the enzyme amplification rate, overall amplification efficiency,
and the time at which the reaction initiates. Next, we plotted the
peak time to threshold (Supporting Information, Figure S1). Images were collected in 30 s intervals, and we
report the average of three trials. In some cases, the difference
in time to threshold was less than the imaging time interval. For
each time point, if fewer than 15 partitions (0.075% of total partitions)
were “on,” that time point was not included in the calculation
of the mode. For these measurements, at the start of the reaction,
the heat block was at 25 °C and the time to threshold included
the time for the heat block to come to reaction temperature (∼70
s). Hence, there will be minor differences (seconds) in the time for
each reaction to reach the fixed temperature. We do not see evidence
that this difference manifests in the mode time to positive (TTP)
measurements.

In reactions with Bst 2.0, below
68 °C, mode TTP was narrowly clustered around 9.5 min. At 70
°C, mode TTP increased and the reaction failed to amplify beyond
72 °C. In reactions with Bst 3.0, the mode TTP
decreased from 8.2 ± 0.3 (mode ± SD) min at 64 °C to
6.6 ± 0.3 min at 70 °C, then increased with increasing temperature
until amplification failed for all partitions at temperatures ≥76
°C. In the negative controls for both enzymes (Supporting Information, Figure S1), amplification either failed or started
after 75 min.

Several observations can be made by comparing
the results from Figure 3e,f. We found that
the optimal temperature for time to threshold corresponded with the
optimal temperature for amplification efficiency (Figure 3a,b) and that the optimal temperatures
also had the smallest tailing factors, full width at half-maximum
(fwhm) and asymmetric factor (i.e., narrowest peak widths) (Figure 3e,f; Supporting Information, Table S1). At optimal efficiency, Bst
3.0 was approximately 2 min faster in mode TTP, had much
narrower fwhm, smaller tailing factor, and lower asymmetry than Bst 2.0. Finally, as efficiency decreased, measurements
of peak shape and width increased. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first published quantification that explicitly tests and quantifies
the time dependence of LAMP efficiency using these enzymes. Real-time
digital enables us to identify the time point at which the observed
concentration most closely approximates the true concentration thus
optimizing the assay duration.

Rates of Amplification
(Specific and Nonspecific)
Fourth,
we compared the rates of specific and nonspecific amplification between Bst 2.0 and Bst 3.0. The data shown represent
the combined rates of three separate trials. We found that nonspecific
amplification rates were similar for the two enzymes (Figure 3g, dashed lines), whereas in
the presence of template, amplification rates were faster for Bst 2.0 than Bst 3.0 (Figure 3g, solid lines) despite lower
efficiency at short times. Differences in camera sensitivity between
the microscope (used for real-time images in Figure 2) and the RTAI (used for Figure 3) result in different apparent
amplification rates.

We also examined the relationship between
temperature, efficiency, and maximum rate. In the case of Bst 3.0, maximum reaction amplification rate does not correspond
with optimal efficiency (Figure 3h). A temperature of 64 °C had the fastest amplification
rates but suboptimal efficiency (57.3% at 45 min). Optimal amplification
efficiency occurs at 68 °C (71.5% at 45 min) but slightly slower
amplification rate than 64 °C. At 74 °C, we observed both
poor efficiency (32.7% at 45 min) and the slowest reaction rate. We
attribute this to a combination of decreased enzymatic velocity and
decreased primer annealing. Additionally, we note that different thresholds
for amplification rate would be needed for each temperature. This
is expected given changes in enzymatic velocity.

Application of the Pipeline to a Phenotypic Antibiotic Susceptibility
Test (AST) Using Clinical Samples
We next asked whether we
could apply the output of this digital real-time pipeline to perform
a rapid phenotypic AST. Specifically, we aimed to categorically sort
clinical samples as phenotypically “susceptible” or
“resistant” to an antibiotic in agreement with the gold-standard
reference method. This study was constructed as a demonstration of
the capability of the microfluidic chips and the value gained from
using this digital real-time pipeline to optimize reaction conditions;
it was not an assessment of the digital AST (dAST) methodology established
previously.17,18 We selected the optimal dLAMP
conditions for Bst 3.0 based on the measurements
of mode TTP and amplification efficiency established in the previous
experiments (Figure 3b), 70 °C and a reaction time of 10 min. We used archived clinical
urine samples from patients diagnosed with urinary tract infections
(UTI) containing E. coli. These samples
had been categorized as phenotypically susceptible or resistant to
the antibiotics ciprofloxacin or nitrofurantoin using the gold-standard
(broth microdilution) method.18 We tested
exactly 17 samples and observed 100% categorical agreement with the
gold-standard method (0 major errors; 0 minor errors). We conclude
that the pipeline presented in this paper performs well and could
be used, among other applications, to optimize reaction conditions
for speed and sensitivity and apply those conditions to a determination
of phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility in clinical samples.

Conclusion
We have presented a pipeline to generate real-time, digital isothermal
amplification measurements using only commercial and open-source components.
We used this pipeline to examine how small changes in reaction conditions
influence the interplay of LAMP efficiency, speed, and background
by performing 124 real-time dLAMP experiments. As one practical application
of this approach, we determined the optimal reaction conditions for
a phenotypic test of antibiotic susceptibility using 17 clinical urine
samples from patients diagnosed with urinary tract infections. In
all cases, the results of the optimized dLAMP assays were in agreement
with the clinical gold-standard AST.

These experiments validate
that real-time digital measurements
enable tests of enzymatic performance in dLAMP. Generally, we found
that each enzyme had a unique optimal temperature for amplification
efficiency (probability of detecting a target molecule) and for eliminating
nonspecific amplification. This “optimal” temperature
produced the fastest mode TTP and the narrowest, most symmetrical
distribution curves; interestingly, the optimal temperature did not
necessarily yield the fastest amplification rate. Together, these
data suggest that amplification efficiency is an interplay of enzymatic
rate, diffusive transport, and DNA breathing. When reactions are performed
away from optimal temperature, the distribution curves broaden and
decrease in total area, resulting in reduced overall amplification
efficiency and slower mode TTP, whereas amplification rate decreases
with increasing temperature. With regard to the specific enzymes in
this study, although efficiency was similar at long amplification
times (>20 min), Bst 3.0 had a faster mode TTP
than Bst 2.0 by approximately 2 min and more narrow
and symmetrical
distribution curves. However, Bst 2.0 had faster
amplification rates than Bst 3.0, so reactions with Bst 2.0 took longer to initiate but proceeded more rapidly.
For both polymerases, nonspecific amplification in buffer was extremely
low.

In the future, this pipeline can be used to understand
the fundamental
pieces of LAMP. The field of diagnostics would benefit from a thorough
mechanistic study of LAMP by asking which components determine amplification
fate and how components, such as primers and heating rate (Supporting
Information, Figure S2), impact reaction
and enzymatic speed. This pipeline makes such a mechanistic study
possible. For example, in this study, we corrected the observed concentration
by separating true positives from background amplification using rate
and fluorescence, but we did not explore the origins of nonspecific
amplicons, which deserves its own study and development of more precise
tools for studies of nonspecific amplification. Finally, this pipeline
can be extended to optimize other isothermal amplification chemistries
that could be suited to other types of diagnostic assays.

Ultimately,
this pipeline will make digital real-time measurements
more accessible to researchers, even those who lack microfluidic expertise
or specialized equipment. The commercially available chips and reagents
used here could be coupled with many combinations of standard laboratory
or field equipment such as a hot plate and a fluorescent stereoscope
or a chemical heater and a cell phone camera. Although we believe
the general trends found in this paper will extend to other primer
sets, we hope this pipeline will enable others to study other primer
sets and conditions of interest to them.
