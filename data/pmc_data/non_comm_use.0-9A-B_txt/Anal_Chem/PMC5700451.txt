Knowledge of lectin
and glycosidase specificities is fundamental
to the study of glycobiology. The primary specificities of such molecules
can be uncovered using well-established tools, but the complex details
of their specificities are difficult to determine and describe. Here
we present a language and algorithm for the analysis and description
of glycan motifs with high complexity. The language uses human-readable
notation and wildcards, modifiers, and logical operators to define
motifs of nearly any complexity. By applying the syntax to the analysis
of glycan-array data, we found that the lectin AAL had higher binding
where fucose groups are displayed on separate branches. The lectin
SNA showed gradations in binding based on the length of the extension
displaying sialic acid and on characteristics of the opposing branches.
A new algorithm to evaluate changes in lectin binding upon treatment
with exoglycosidases identified the primary specificities and potential
fine specificities of an α1–2-fucosidase and an α2–3,6,8-neuraminidase.
The fucosidase had significantly lower action where sialic acid neighbors
the fucose, and the neuraminidase showed statistically lower action
where α1–2 fucose neighbors the sialic acid or is on
the opposing branch. The complex features identified here would have
been inaccessible to analysis using previous methods. The new language
and algorithms promise to facilitate the precise determination and
description of lectin and glycosidase specificities.

==== Body
Protein–glycan
interactions
are fundamental to the biology of every organism. Glycan-binding proteins
that have no enzymatic activity are called lectins and are involved
in development, immune recognition, and signal transduction, among
others.1 Enzymes that act upon glycans,
such as glycosyltransferases and glycosidases, contribute to biosynthesis,
metabolism, catabolism, and disease states.2 An important goal in the study of such proteins and enzymes is to
characterize the specificities of their binding to particular glycans,
which is valuable both for glycobiology research as well as for practical
applications. The applications include the use of lectins to probe
for specific glycans in biological samples3 and the use of glycosidases to break down glycans to enable analysis.4 Researchers also are pursuing inhibitors5 and probes6 of enzymatic
activity and glycan-receptor interactions7 for therapeutic purposes.

The primary feature recognized by
a lectin or glycosidase/glycosyltransferase
can be uncovered using a small number of glycans in semiquantitative
analyses. But the details of the interactions are usually harder to
determine and describe, due to the huge range of structural features
that may influence binding or activity. The amount of binding can
be modulated by structural features away from the main binding site,
such as substituents on neighboring monosaccharides or the length
of the branch containing the binding site.8,9 Recent
studies of human intelectin-110 and DC-SIGN11 provide examples of complex rules governing
glycan recognition. Glycan arrays, now a standard tool for studying
lectin specificities,12 have greatly helped
to sort out the complexities in lectin binding, because one can obtain
parallel measurements from hundreds of glycans using limited amounts
of material.13 The challenge with such
data is to interpret subtle differences in lectin binding between
multiple, closely related glycoforms.

We previously introduced
a textual system to describe patterns
of substructures, or motifs, that could represent the binding determinant
of a lectin.14 A system of defining motifs
was important for enabling automated, statistical analyses of glycan
arrays. With the text-based definitions of motifs, we could search
for the presence of motifs in a set of glycans and quantify the association
of lectin binding with the presence or absence of each motif. By automating
the method, we performed comparative analyses of >3000 data sets.15 The textual system used at that time, however,
had a limitation: it could not represent complex features that affect
binding. The syntax of the language and the implementation of the
software did not have the capacity to represent higher-level features
that we and other researchers were finding to be important in lectin
binding. Other researchers have contributed valuable tools for the
analysis of glycan-array data,16−18 but these advances still would
not provide the capabilities we sought.

In the research presented
here, we developed a practical language
for describing motifs of nearly any complexity, and we developed algorithms
for testing the relationships between the motifs and the lectin binding
or enzyme activity. No algorithm previously existed for the analysis
of enzyme specificities from glycan-array data; here we employed a
new method for finding features of glycans that associate with changes
to lectin binding upon the treatment of the arrays with exoglycosidases.
We show that complex features of glycans are associated with lectin
binding and enzyme activity, including features that would have been
inaccessible to analysis using previous methods.

Experimental Section
Preparation
of the Human-Milk Oligosaccharide Arrays
The synthesis of
glycans at the University of Georgia for human-milk
oligosaccharide arrays was described earlier.19 A catalog of the complete set is in Figure S-1. Individual glycans were dissolved at 100 μM in a sodium phosphate
buffer (50 mM, pH 9.0) and printed in replicates of six with spot
volume of ∼400 pL. All compounds were printed onto NHS-activated
microscope slides (Nexterion H, Schott) using a noncontact microarray
printer (Scienion S3) that deposited about 460 pL per spot. The slides
were printed with 24 subarrays in a 3 × 8 layout. Each subarray
contained six replicate spots of each of the 60 compounds, printed
in a 22 × 18 grid. After printing, the slides were incubated
in a humidity chamber for 24 h and blocked for 1 h with 5 mM ethanolamine
in Tris buffer (50 mM, pH 9.0). Blocked slides were rinsed with DI
water, spun dry, and kept in a desiccator at room temperature until
use.

Glycan-Array Data Acquisition
Screening solutions of
biotinylated Aleuria aurantia lectin
(AAL), Ulex europaeus agglutinin I
(UEA), and Sambucus nigra agglutinin
(SNA) (Vector Laboratories) were created by premixing streptavidin–AlexaFluor
635 conjugate (ThermoFisher) at a 1:3 ratio by weight of lectin/conjugate
in TSM binding buffer (20 mM Tris–Cl, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.05% Tween, and 1 g/L BSA, pH 7.4).
Final lectin concentrations for AAL, UEA, and SNA were 1, 10, and
10 μg/mL, respectively. An amount of 100 μL of lectin
solution was added to each subarray and was incubated at room temperature,
in the dark, for 1 h. The slides were washed with TSM wash buffer
(20 mM Tris–Cl, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, and 0.05% Tween, pH 7.4), TSM buffer (20 mM Tris–Cl,
50 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, and 2 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4),
and DI water, and then spun dry as previously reported.20

Human galectin-3 and galectin-9 (R&D Systems) were dissolved
at 10 and 2 μg/mL, and 3 and 0.8 μg/mL, respectively in
TBS buffer (25 mM Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.2) with 0.1% BSA and 0.05%
Tween. Separately, solutions of biotinylated mouse antigalectin-3
(PeproTech) at 5 μg/mL, biotinylated mouse antigalectin-3 (PeproTech)
at 5 μg/mL, and streptavidin–AlexaFluor at 5 μg/mL
were each prepared in TBS buffer containing 0.1% BSA and 0.05% Tween.
Each array was incubated as described above with one of the lectin
solutions, followed by incubations with the corresponding secondary
antibody solution and the streptavidin–AlexaFluor solution.
After each incubation, the slides were washed and dried as described
above. All slides were stored in the dark prior to acquiring fluorescence
images using a microarray scanner (GenePix 4000B, Axon Instruments).
Image analysis was performed with GenePix Pro 7 software to obtain
the total fluorescence intensity of each spot. After background subtraction,
the highest and lowest values of the six replicates from the same
compound were removed, and the remaining values were averaged.

Additional glycan-array data were downloaded from the Consortium
for Functional Glycomics (CFG). We used the data sets for AAL and
UEA from array version 5.0, lectin concentration 1.0 μg/mL (IDs
primscreen_4735 and primscreen_4212, respectively). The information
given through the CFG and here conform to the MIRAGE standards for
glycomics experiments.21 The processed
data from glycan-array experiments generated for this research are
available in Table S-1.

On-Chip Glycosidase
Digestion
After printing the arrays
and prior to blocking, the slides were placed in an 8 × 3 hybridization
cassette (ArrayIt, Sunnyvale, CA) and treated with the following glycosidase
conditions. An α2–3,6,8-neuraminidase from Arthrobacter ureafaciens (Roche) was prepared at
2 units per 100 μL in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, with 5 mM
CaCl2 and 1% BSA and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. A
microbial α1,2-l-fucosidase (Megazyme) was prepared
at 0.5 units per 100 μL in 50 mM Tris, pH 6.5, with 1% BSA and
incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. The slides were washed and dried
as described above.

Software Availability and Data Preparation
The MotifFinder
program was written in Matlab and is available for download at haablab.vai.org or upon request
to the authors. The motifs were generated manually by text entry.
Statistical analyses and graphing were done in Microsoft Excel and
Graphpad Pro, and figures were prepared in Canvas.

Safety Considerations
The experimental methods presented
here require standard safety precautions.

Results
A New Motif
Language
The new language (Tables 1 and S-2) is expanded
from a syntax introduced earlier.22 We
sought to develop a system that is flexible enough to
describe any binding determinant, yet human-readable and easy to use.
We also wanted notation that is immediately recognizable by those
familiar with glycobiology and explicit definitions rather than common
terms such as “Lewis X”. Examples are given in Figure 1 of simple (Figure 1, parts A and B)
and complex (Figure 1, parts D and F) motifs. Some of the motifs could not have been easily
represented using previous methods, such as motifs containing noncontiguous
features (Figure 1C)
or exclusions of a specific number of features (Figure 1F).

Figure 1 Examples of motifs and their presence or absence in glycans. In
each example, the text definition of a motif is given along with the
graphical representation of representative glycans. A green circle
indicates the presence of the motif, and a red circle indicates a
feature that precludes the motif.

An effective method to analyze glycan-array data is to identify
the motifs that are present in each glycan, and then explore the relationships
between lectin binding and the presence of each motif (Figure 2A), a technique we introduced
earlier.14 The analysis could be partitioned
into two steps (Figure 2B): (i) determine the basic motif that is nearly always present upon
binding of the lectin (the primary specificity) and (ii) uncover the
more complex features that modulate lectin binding (the fine specificity),
such as functionalities adjacent to the primary determinant. To identify
the primary binding determinant, one could compare lectin binding
between glycans that contain a motif to all glycans that do not. The
explore fine specificities, one could compare glycans containing a
given motif to glycans containing an altered motif (Figure 2B).23,24 For the first analysis, we manually generated a “stock”
set of motifs (Table S-3) that broadly
covers the various types of motifs typically encountered in glycan
arrays. For the second analysis, we define custom motifs to probe
specific features observed from the analysis using the stock motifs.

Figure 2 Using
motifs in the analysis of glycan-array data. (A) The initial
steps in the analysis of glycan-array data are to quantify the binding
of a lectin to each glycan (top) and to determine the presence or
absence of each motif in the glycans (bottom). (B) Adding features
to a base motif defines subsets of glycans within the larger sets
(top). One may compare the lectin binding between sets of glycans
(bottom), such as between glycans containing a motif and all other
glycans, or between subsets of glycans.

To facilitate the analysis, we developed a software program
to
parse the input text of glycans and motifs, search for the presence
of motifs in glycans, and calculate a score for each motif indicating
the strength of association between the motif and lectin binding.
(See Tables S-4 and S-5 for example input
and output, respectively.) The program uses various statistical measures
to identify motifs that are reliably associated with binding (Figure S-2). Useful summary values are the log-transformed p-values of Welch’s t test (referred
to as TScore) and the area-under-the-curve (AUC) of receiver–operator
characteristic curves (see the Supporting Information for complete descriptions).

Using Motifs To Define
Primary and Fine Specificities from Glycan-Array
Data
The ability to define complex motifs should be especially
useful when using glycan arrays with complex glycans. New libraries
of glycans with controlled extensions and modifications on linear
or branched oligosaccharides25 provided
the opportunity to further test the capabilities of the motif language.
A glycan array with 60 glycans having a variety of branching, fucosylation,
and sialylation patterns19 was probed with
the A. aurantia lectin (AAL), U. europaeus agglutinin (UEA), and S. nigra agglutinin (SNA). Previous analyses of glycan-array
data acquired from the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG) showed
that the rules governing the binding of these lectins were not easy
to capture using basic notation.23 Although
the basic determinant of AAL is known to be α-linked fucose,
other features—not readily evident—result in greater
or lesser binding.

We ran the analysis with the stock set of motifs (Table S-3) to obtain the primary specificity
of AAL. The top-scoring motif was “Fuca” (motif 1),
TScore 11.6 and AUC 1.0. The distributions of intensities (Figure 3A) and high AUC indicate
complete separation based on presence or absence of motif 1, but the
distributions also showed that many glycans containing motif 1 bound
AAL weakly. We examined the nonbinding glycans to identify features
that potentially could explain the low binding, and then defined new
motifs to test the relationships (Figure 3A and Table S-6). We found that among glycans with two or more fucoses, those with
one or two branches had higher binding than linear glycans. Furthermore,
if the fucoses were on different branches, binding was higher than
if they were on the same branch. UEA did not show this relationship
(not shown).

Figure 3 Uncovering complex motifs in the HMO array. Each plot
shows the
fluorescence intensities of glycans containing the indicated motifs.
Glycan arrays containing human-milk oligosaccharides were incubated
with the lectins AAL (A) and SNA (B). The depicted glycans are representatives
from each group (see Figure S-1 for all
glycans on the array).

The top motif for SNA among the stock set of motifs was “Neu5Aca2–6Galb”
(motif 56), TScore 9.4 and AUC 1.0. As with AAL, we saw complete separation
of intensities based on the top motif in the initial analysis, but
we also defined custom motifs that identify possible sources of variation
in binding (Figure 3B and Table S-6). For example, we saw
a trend toward higher binding if the sialic acid is on the longer
branch, and we observed consistently higher binding when the sialic
acid was at the end of a long extension. In some cases, binding was
high even if the sialic acid was not on the longer branch, provided
the branch opposing the sialic acid displayed 3′-linked fucose.
Combining these features revealed clear distinctions in binding (Figure 3B). Sialic acid either
on a long extension (tri-LacNAc), or with an opposing branch of equivalent
or lesser length that displays 3′ fucose, has higher binding
than all other motifs containing sialic acid. The examples demonstrate
gradations of binding based on complex features of glycans. In a similar
way, we found motifs associated with gradations in binding for human
galectin-3 and galectin-9 (Figure S-3).We
also analyzed glycan-array data from the CFG for AAL and UEA (Figure S-4 and Table S-6). The top motifs from the stock list were “Fuca” (motif
1) for AAL and “Fuca1–2Galb” (motif 4) for UEA,
consistent with the known specificities. A detailed analysis showed
that AAL and UEA both bind better to Fucα1–2 when the
neighboring Gal is in a β1–4 linkage and when its 3′
location is free. The trends among the new motifs were reproducible
at multiple concentrations of AAL and UEA, indicating the differences
were not spurious features of a single array (Figure S-4). Certain features may result from the immobilization
of the glycan,26 but the analysis nevertheless
identified directions for further study.

Applying the Method to
the Analysis of Enzyme Specificity
The characterization of
glycosyltransferases and glycosidases often
centers on two traits: the feature that is added or removed and the
features of the glycan that modulate activity. The former trait can
be fairly straightforward to determine, but the features that affect
activity require empirical comparisons over many glycans. To investigate
whether particular features of glycans modulate enzyme activity, we
analyzed glycan arrays that in parallel were either treated or untreated
by a glycosidase, and then probed with lectins (Figure 4A). Arrays treated with an α1–2-fucosidase
were probed with AAL and UEA, and arrays treated with an α2–3,6,8-neuraminidase
were probed with SNA. From these data, we calculated a percent change
in lectin binding to each glycan.

Figure 4 Using motifs to uncover details of exoglycosidase
specificities.
(A) Method of detecting changes in lectin binding upon glycosidase
treatment. (B) The removal motif is the part of the glycan removed
by the glycosidase, and the recognition motif is the part of the glycan
that affects enzyme activity. (C) The program generates in-silico-modified
glycans. If a glycan contains a recognition motif that includes the
removal motif, the program eliminates the removal motif from the glycan.
The program then determines, for each lectin, whether the lectin’s
primary motif is present or absent in the original and modified glycans.
(D) For each removal motif, the program groups the glycans according
the presence or absence of the recognition motif and by the expected
change in lectin binding. (E) For the fucosidase, motifs 1, 12, and
7 are examples of moderate, poor, and good recognition motifs, respectively.
The graphs show the percent changes in lectin binding in each of the
groups defined in panel D. Each graph contains pooled data from AAL
and UEA. Fine-specificity analysis revealed statistically higher percent
changes where the galactose neighboring the fucose had no sialic acid
relative to where it had sialic acid at the 6′ location. (F)
For the neuraminidase, motif 56 showed a very good fit to the expected
changes. Fine-specificity analysis showed that α1–2-linked
fucose could have an inhibitory effect.

We developed an algorithm to quantify the relationship between
the motifs and the enzyme-induced changes to lectin binding (Figure 4A–D and supplementary
methods in the Supporting Information).
For each enzyme, we defined the feature that is removed, called the
removal motif (Figure 4B). The removal motif was Fucα for the fucosidase and Siaα
for the neuraminidase. We then defined recognition motifs, which are
the features surrounding the removal motif that potentially influence
enzyme activity. The recognition motifs initially comprised the stock
set defined above. Next, for each recognition motif, we predicted
the change in lectin binding to each glycan upon enzyme treatment.
If a glycan contained a recognition motif that included the removal
motif, we created an in-silico-modified glycan with the removal motif
eliminated, and then determined the presence of the lectin-binding
motif in the original and modified glycan (Figure 4C). The next step was to group the glycans
by expected enzyme activity and by expected effect on lectin binding
(Figure 4D).

With such groups, we could compare the experimental data to the
expected trends. For each recognition motif, we performed a statistical
comparison between the groups expected to show a change (groups P10
and P01) and those not expected to show a change (groups N10 and N01).
A summary value of this comparison was the log-transformed p-value of the Mann–Whitney U test,
referred to as the MWScore (see the Supporting Information). Another method was to calculate a “fit-to-expected”
parameter based on the root-mean-squared of the differences between
the expected and actual percent changes across all glycans (see the Supporting Information). The expected percent
changes were 1.0 and −1.0 for groups P10 and P01, respectively,
and 0 for groups N10 and N01. The fit-to-expected parameter allowed
us to compare the observed patterns to the theoretical ideal (fit-to-expected
value of 1).

For the fucosidase, the motif with the highest
score was motif
7, Fuca1–2Galb<3or4>GlcNAc (score 0.77), which concords
with the known specificity of the enzyme. In comparison, motif 1 (Fuca)
and motif 12 (Fuca1–3Any) had much lower scores: 0.38 and 0,
respectively. (See Table S-6 for complete
scores.) Plots of the percent changes of the glycans in each group
illustrate the relationships (Figure 4E). Motif 7 showed high values for nearly all group-P10
glycans and low values for nearly all the rest. (Some glycans in group
P11 had the AAL-binding motif in both the original and modified glycans
but showed a high change in binding.) We next investigated whether
the fine specificity of the enzyme would be discernible among the
glycans in group P10. By comparing percent changes between glycans
containing or not containing specific recognition motifs, we found
that glycans with a sialic acid neighboring the fucose had statistically
lower (p = 0.015, Mann−Whitney U test) percent changes than glycans without a neighboring sialic
acid (Figure 4E).

The top motif for the neuraminidase was motif 56 (Neu5Aca2–6Galb),
score 0.92 (Table S-6). The known specificity
of the enzyme is broader than motif 56, but we only had information
about α2–6-linked sialic acid because we detected only
with SNA, which binds this linkage. The use of additional lectins
would provide more breadth to the analysis, but the method was robust
enough to properly find a subset of the actual specificity with only
one lectin. A fine-specificity analysis suggested that a fucoseα1–2
neighboring the sialic acid or on the opposing branch could reduce
enzyme activity (Figure 4F).

We also compared the specificities of three neuraminidases,
two
that cleave all linkages (Ar. ureafaciens and Clostridium perfringens) and
one that prefers to remove sialic acid in the α2–3 linkage
(Salmonella typhimurium). In addition,
we tested the use of lectins to detect underlying monosaccharides
that would be exposed by enzymatic action, in this case Erythrinia cristagalli lectin (ECL) to detect terminal
Galβ1–4GlcNAc and Bauhinia purpurea lectin (BPL) to detect terminal galactose and N-acetyl-galactosamine. The top motifs calculated by the algorithm
(Table S-6) were Siaa2-<3or6>Gal
(motif
175, score 0.62) for Ar. ureafaciens, <8f>Siaa2-<3or6>Galb (motif 194, score 0.63) for C. perfringens, and <8f>Siaa2–3Galb
(motif
193, score 0.51) for Sa. typhimurium, thus correctly identifying the distinction between the enzymes
in the linkages they cleave. The galactose-binding and sialic-acid-binding
lectins contributed equivalent information (Figure S-5), confirming the value of detecting newly exposed, underlying
features.

Discussion
The study of the complex
details of lectin and glycosidase recognition
of glycans necessitated a method to represent complex motifs and to
evaluate them in experimental data. Here we demonstrated the value
of a new syntax and analysis system for finding modifiers to the binding
and activity of several lectins and exoglycosidases. The method identified
several features that would not have been practically analyzable using
manual analyses or previous modes of representing motifs. Further
experiments will be required to validate the roles of the new motifs
in lectin binding and glycosidase activity, but the results establish
the ability to quantify features in glycan-array data that would be
otherwise difficult to test. The software makes the approach accessible
to non-bioinformatics researchers, and it promises to provide a useful
complement to existing data-exploration tools, such as those available
through the CFG. The new capabilities should have value for fundamental
studies in glycobiology or for downstream use in glycan analyses.
For example, one could use the output of MotifFinder to calculate
the likelihood of various motifs being present in a sample, based
on the binding of lectins to the sample before and after glycosidase
treatment.22 In addition, the motif language
may have inherent value for searching glycoinformatics databases27 or for linking data between disparate platforms,
such as mass spectrometry or chromatography.

A limitation of
glycan-array analysis is that it does not take
into account structural and chemical information, which ultimately
determine the binding between a glycan and protein. Computational
glycobiologists are uncovering the chemical and structural bases for
protein–glycan binding8 and are
linking such analyses with results from glycan arrays.9 Both types of information are important, with the glycan
arrays providing measurements of binding and the structural studies
providing explanations and predictions of binding. The quantifications
achieved using MotifFinder could be plugged in to the structural analyses
to achieve improved accuracy.

The analyses presented here showed
the necessity of complex motif
definitions. The most interesting motifs were found on arrays that
contained glycans with unequal extensions and substituents on each
branch,19 indicating that, as the experimental
data more closely model the complexity of glycobiology, the analyses
will benefit from methods capable of mining that complexity. We found
that AAL bound better to multiple fucoses when the fucoses were on
separate branches (Figure 3A). The improved binding of AAL to fucoses on separate branches
likely relates to its quaternary structure of a sixfold β-propellor,
with five fucose binding sites on the edges.28,29 Multimeric structures and binding are common features among lectins,30,31 so the arrays with nonsymmetrical glycans combined with the ability
to define complex motifs should be valuable to sort out the relative
effects of unequal and equal modifications to branches. Similarly,
with SNA we observed the influence of relationships between the branches.
The relative lengths of the branches containing or not containing
sialic acid seemed to modulate binding, as did the presence of α1–3-linked
fucose on the opposing branch. Such relationships would need to be
confirmed with more experimentation, but the results show the potential
importance of complex motifs and the ability to uncover these relationships.
Glycan asymmetry can be a mode of regulating glycan interactions in
biology via heteromultivalent interactions, as shown with HIV-neutralizing
antibodies,32 so the characterization of
lectins that are influenced by unequal modifications could help to
probe the regulating mechanisms.

Using the CFG data, we found
that AAL and UEA bound to α1–2-linked
fucose better where the galactose was β1–4-linked instead
of β1–3-linked and was not substituted at the 3′
location. The former feature represents type-2 N-acetyl-lactosamine,
which is the disaccharide repeat comprising glycan extensions, and
the latter feature represents the H antigen (Fucα1–2Gal),
in distinction to the A antigen (Fucα1–2(GalNAcα1–3)Gal)
and B antigen (Fucα1–2(Galα1–3)Gal). The
preference of UEA for the H antigen was noted in a previous glycan-array
analysis.16 The biological effects of switching
from type-2 to type-1, or switching between the A, B, and H antigens,
are not known, but reducing engagement of the terminal fucose could
be part of the functional mechanisms.

The use of glycan arrays
to study enzyme specificities was a new
challenge. The feasibility of the experiments was shown in a study
of influenza neuraminidase,33 but we needed
to develop an algorithm for the quantitative evaluation of enzyme
preferences. Our method proved accurate in finding the primary specificities
of the enzymes and showed promise for identifying fine specificities.
The reduction in fucosidase action when sialic acid was near the removal
motif, and the reduced action of neuraminidase in relation to fucoseα1–2,
could be due to steric hindrance. But with the neuraminidase, the
effect was present even when the fucose was on the opposite branch,
suggesting the role not only of steric hindrance but also of engagement
with the nonsialylated extension. A potential function of α1–2
fucosylation, it follows, would be to reduce neuraminidase activity.
Future studies of human neuraminidases in this context could be helpful
to gain insights into the functions of human A/B/O blood group antigens,
which display α1–2 fucosylation.

The language and
method presented here will enable deep analyses
of lectins and enzymes, as well as the development of additional novel
approaches in glycan analysis. Given the continual discoveries of
lectins and glycan-active enzymes, researchers will need tools flexible
enough to handle unusual specificities. Developers of glycan arrays
have created structures that cover diverse areas of glycobiology,
including mammalian glycans,13,34 microbial glycans,35,36 and various types of sialylated structures,37−39 which may be
helpful in acquiring data to characterize newly discovered molecules.
Another benefit of algorithms for automated interpretation is increased
accessibility to researchers without expertise in glycobiology. A
goal for further development will be to link software employing the
motif syntax with experimental platforms that are designed to make
glycan analysis routine.
