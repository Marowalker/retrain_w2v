Although it is known that the Raman
spectroscopic signature of
single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is highly chirality dependent,
using Raman spectroscopy with several laser excitations as a tool
for quantifying fraction of either metallic or semiconducting nanotubes
in a sample has become a widely used analytical method. In this work,
using the electron diffraction technique as a basis, we have examined
the validity of Raman spectroscopy for quantitative evaluation of
metallic fractions (M%) in single-walled carbon nanotube samples.
Our results show that quantitative Raman spectroscopic evaluations
of M% by using several discrete laser lines, either by using integrated
intensities of chirality-associated radial breathing modes (RBMs)
or, as has been more commonly utilized in recent studies, by statistically
counting the numbers of RBMs can be misrepresentative. Specifically,
we have found that the occurrence numbers of certain types of RBMs
in Raman spectral mapping depend critically on the diameter distribution,
resonant coupling between transition energies and excitation laser
energy, and the chirality-dependent Raman scattering cross sections
rather than simply on the metallic and semiconducting SWCNT fractions.
These dependencies are similar to those observed in the integrated
intensities of RBMs. Our findings substantially advance the understanding
of the proper use of Raman spectroscopy for carbon nanotube quantification,
which is important for carbon nanotube characterization and crucial
to guide research in SWCNT growth and their applications.

Single-walled
carbon nanotubes
(SWCNTs) are one of the most promising candidates for future high-performance
electronic devices because of their remarkable physical, mechanical,
and electrical properties.1−5 A SWCNT can be either metallic (M) or semiconducting (S) depending
on its chirality, usually denoted by a pair of integers (n,m), that is, M-SWCNT when mod(n – m, 3) = 0 and S-SWCNT if mod(n – m, 3) =
1 or 2 (commonly referred to as mod1 or mod2 types, respectively).6 M-SWCNTs can withstand
ultrahigh current densities due to ballistic electron transport,7,8 while S-SWCNTs possess high intrinsic carrier mobility and are an
ideal channel material for field-effect transistors.1 In spite of their extraordinary electrical properties,
an as-prepared sample usually contains a mixture of M- and S-SWCNTs,
which significantly degrades the device performance and causes serious
nonuniformity.5 Therefore, over the past
decade, tremendous efforts have been devoted to obtaining SWCNTs of
a uniform electrical type or even a single chirality, either by direct
synthesis techniques with optimized growth conditions5,9−13 or by postsynthesis separation protocols, such as density gradient
centrifugation14 or DNA assisted separation
of SWCNTs.15,16 Along with those efforts, there
is an urgent demand for accurate, efficient, and fast methods to measure
the fractions of M- (M%) or S-SWCNTs (S%) in samples, which is critical
for providing feedback to further correctly guide the experiments
and to accelerate the commercialization of carbon nanotube materials.

Among a number of characterization methods, Raman spectroscopy
is one of the most popular tools for SWCNT structure measurements.
It requires minimal sample preparation but provides a wealth of information
about the quality of the material, the conductivity and chiral structure
of the nanotubes, and their phonon and electron quantum confinement.17 Recently Raman spectroscopy at discrete multiple
laser excitations has become a commonplace tool to quantify a fraction
of a specific type of conductivity9−11,18−30 or even the population of nanotubes of a certain chirality in the
as-grown SWCNT samples.10,11,31,32 In the reported quantitative
evaluation procedures, two strategies are used to calculate the M%
or S% in a sample. Both approaches are based on the radial breathing
modes (RBM) features of resonant (n,m) SWCNTs, either by calculating the integrated RBM intensities18−24 or by statistically counting the number of RBM peaks25−33 appearing in the regions of Raman spectra assignable to M- and S-SWCNTs.
Both methods take for granted that the integrated intensities or the
occurrences of RBMs positioned in the M- and S-SWCNT regions of Raman
spectra are simply proportional to the M- and S-SWCNT abundance in
the sample. However, Raman scattering in SWCNTs is a resonant process.
The appearance of an RBM and its intensity depend largely on the match
of transition energies (Eii) with excitation laser energy (ELaser)34−36 as well as environment37−39 and SWCNT (n,m) structure.40−46 These facts cast shadows over experimental quantitative or even
qualitative analysis of M% using RBM features from Raman spectra measured
at discrete multiple ELaser.

Here
we present a thorough study of the validity of current practices
using Raman spectroscopy for quantitative assessment of the fraction
of metallic or semiconducting carbon nanotubes. Three SWCNT samples
with different diameter distributions were involved in the study.
First, we obtained the (n,m) distribution
maps and M% of all three samples using a microbeam electron diffraction
(ED) technique. The M% of the same samples were then investigated
using Raman spectroscopy. Two common practices of Raman characterization
were examined: (1) by analyzing the integrated RBM intensities of
Raman spectra measured from thin films and (2) by statistically counting
the RBM numbers of hundreds of micro-Raman spectra in Raman spectral
mapping acquired from SWCNTs on a substrate. By discerning the difference
of Raman outcomes from the ED results, we have a multidimensional
perspective on a number of issues associated with current approaches
of Raman quantitative analysis of M% and chirality population. Those
important findings pave the way to reliable measurements of M- and
S-SWCNT fractions with quantitative Raman spectroscopy and further
guide SWCNT experiments for their various promising applications.

Experimental
Section
SWCNT Samples
Three SWCNT samples were studied in this
work, including two SWCNT samples synthesized by the floating catalyst-chemical
vapor deposition (FC-CVD) methods,47,48 and a commercial
RM8281 SWCNT reference material released by the U.S. National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST).49,50 For convenience,
these samples are referred to as S1 (synthesized by FC-CVD with ferrocene
as catalyst precursor47), S2 (synthesized
by FC-CVD with spark discharge generated Fe particles as catalysts48), and RM8281 (reference material from NIST).
The diameter distributions of S1, S2, and RM8281 samples are 1.2–1.5,
0.8–1.4, and 0.7–0.9 nm, respectively. In addition,
a commercial purified high-pressure CO disproportion (HiPCO) SWCNT
powder (batch, HP27-061C, NanoIntegris Inc.) with a diameter distribution
of 0.8–1.2 nm was used as a reference SWCNT sample, with an
assumed M% of 36 (±4)%9,18−20,23 to calculate the M% of an unknown
SWCNT sample using integrated RBM intensities.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
and Electron Diffraction
High-resolution transmission electron
microscope (TEM) imaging
and electron diffraction measurements were carried out by using a
JEOL-2200FS double aberration-corrected microscope (JEOL Ltd., Japan),
operated at 80 kV, well below the electron knockout damage threshold
for carbon.51 For electron diffraction
analysis, TEM samples were so well prepared that SWCNTs were well
dispersed on holey carbon film supported TEM grids, and only isolated
and straight SWCNTs were analyzed. Determination of the chiral indices
(n,m) from electron diffraction
patterns of individual SWCNTs was based on a calibration-free intrinsic
layer line-spacing method.52

Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectra of all SWCNT samples
were performed on a Labram-HR 800 (Horiba Jobin-Yvon) Raman spectrometer
by using four laser wavelengths (λLaser) of 488,
514, 633, and 785 nm. The Raman spectrometer is coupled with a Synapse
1024 × 256 thermoelectrically cooled open-electrode charge coupled
device (CCD) detector (Horiba) and an Olympus BX-41 microscope equipped
with 10×, 20×, 50×, and 100× magnification objectives.
A PC controlled XYZ stage with a scan area of 75
mm × 50 mm (X × Y) and
step size of 100 nm allows automated acquisition of Raman spectral
mapping measurements. An 1800 mm–1 grating was utilized
to obtain a high spectral resolution of 1 cm–1.

For the SWCNT thin film and powder samples, the Raman spectrum is
averaged based on the measurements of three different points of each
sample, and the 50× microscope objective was used to cover a
larger area of the sample. For the Raman spectral mapping measurements,
we directly deposited S1 sample onto Si/SiO2 chips from
the FC-CVD reactor using a thermophoretic precipitator53 with a controlled tube density of ∼2
tubes/μm. The average tube length of S1 is ∼3 μm.
It is worth noting that the length of SWCNTs is an essential parameter
to be considered in the Raman spectral mapping measurement, since
the RBM from the same nanotube could be multiply counted if the scanning
step is smaller than the nanotube length. Therefore, to avoid multiple
counting of RBMs from the same SWCNT, the Raman spectral mapping was
recorded by scanning the S1 sample on substrate surface in the area
of 60 μm × 60 μm with a scanning step of 4 μm
and a laser spot diameter of ∼1 μm through the 100×
objective. All Raman spectral mapping measurements at the four λLaser were performed at the same locations, which in total
resulted in 1024 micro-Raman spectra. The M% calculation uncertainty
is about ±10%, which is estimated from the spectral fitting of
obtaining integrated RBM intensity or from counting the numbers of
RBMs in Raman spectral mapping.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM, Zeiss Sigma VP) was used to measure the density and lengths
of SWCNTs on Si/SiO2 wafers, which were deposited directly
from the FC-CVD reactor.

Results and Discussion
Electron Diffraction Characterization
We measured the
chirality distributions of three samples, denoted S1, S2, and RM8281,
using ED. To determine the chirality of an individual SWCNT, a high-quality
diffraction pattern with enhanced signal-to-noise ratio is needed.
Figure S1 (see the Supporting Information) shows an example of such electron diffraction patterns accompanied
by a corresponding TEM micrograph of an isolated SWCNT. The diffraction
pattern is mainly composed of a set of parallel-diffracted layer lines
that are separated by certain distances from the equatorial layer
line at the center. With a calibration-free intrinsic layer line-distance
method,52 the chiral indices (n,m) of the nanotube can then be determined without
ambiguity.

Figure 1 presents the chirality distribution of sample S1 based on ED analysis
of a total of 166 individual SWCNTs. For clarity, only SWCNTs with
an occurrence rate over 2% are presented in the histogram. Figure 1 reveals that the
sample S1 shows a very narrow (n,m) distribution with a preference for nanotubes near the armchair
region, with (11,9) being the most abundant chiral species with a
concentration of about 17%. Additionally, the nanotube diameter distribution
falls into a narrow range of 1.2–1.5 nm, and M% is about 24%.
In the S2 sample,48 a wider chirality distribution
with a total of 49 types of chiralities has been identified among
all 90 observed SWCNTs, and M% is about 33%. In the case of the RM8281
sample,49 ED analysis of about 90 individual
nanotubes indicates that (6,5) nanotube is the most abundant chirality
with a concentration about 24% and M% is determined to be about 21%.

SWCNTs. For simplicity, the histogram plots only nanotubes with occurrence
rate more than 2%. The very narrow (n,m) distribution of S1 is gathered at the armchair region with (11,9)
being the most abundant chirality. The M% of S1 is 24%, and narrow
diameters distribution falls into the 1.2–1.5 nm range.

Evaluating M% of SWCNT
Samples Based on Raman Spectroscopy
Currently there are two
commonly used strategies for quantitative
evaluation of M% in SWCNT samples. The first strategy employs the
integrated intensities of RBMs (IRBM)
in the Raman spectra.9,18−24 The fractions of M- and S-SWCNT in a sample are assumed to be proportional
to their integral RBM intensities in the M- and S-SWCNT regions of
a Raman spectrum, respectively. Then the M% of a sample is calculated
by comparing the intensity ratio of RBMs in the M-SWCNT region to
that in the S-SWCNT region (IRBMM/IRBMS) with such a
ratio of a reference sample with known M%. This approach is often
employed in bulk SWCNT samples (e.g., network-type thin films,19 arrays,18 forests,22 and suspensions23) with diameter distributions within 0.8–1.9 nm.

The
second strategy counts the numbers (n) of RBM peaks
in the Raman spectral mapping.25−33 The M% at each ELaser is directly calculated
by statistically counting the numbers of RBM peaks in the M- and S-SWCNT
regions of a series of micro-Raman spectra acquired by Raman spectral
mapping, that is,  This procedure needs sparse SWCNT samples
on a substrate.

Evaluation of M% by Integrating RBM Intensities
Resonant
Raman spectrum of the HiPCO sample presents RBMs in a wide range of
190–300 cm–1, corresponding to both S- and
M-SWCNTs under excitation wavelengths (λLaser) of
488, 514, 633 nm. Since the first strategy requires a reference SWCNT
sample with known M%, usually commercial HiPCO SWCNT samples, with
an estimated M% of about 36% (±4%),9,18−20,23 are employed as the reference
sample. Figure 2 shows
Raman spectra of the HiPCO and S1 samples excited by (a) 633, (b)
514, (c) 488, and (d) 785 nm lasers, respectively. The RBMs of a HiPCO
sample under four excitations are located in the range of about 190–300
cm–1, which is in good agreement with its diameter
distribution of 0.8–1.2 nm, subject to the inverse relationship
between RBM frequency and nanotube diameter.6 Compared with the Kataura plot54,55 (Figure 3) that plots
optical transition energies of each (n,m) against the RBM frequencies, the observed RBMs can be assigned
to electronic types (S- or M-SWCNTs) or even to specific chiralities.
Details description of this Kataura plot is provided
in the Supporting Information. We have
previously calibrated and tested the Kataura plot
used here using the ED technique.49,56 It can be
observed in Figure 3 that the RBMs of the HiPCO sample correspond to both M- and S-SWCNTs
at λLaser = 633, 514, and 488 nm but to only S-SWCNTs
at λLaser = 785 nm. Thus, the 785 nm laser is not
applicable for the M% calculation, since the RBM intensity ratio IRBMM/IRBMS of the HiPCO sample is 0, which leads to the calculated M%
to be 100% for any SWCNT sample. Because of this apparently biased
evaluation, the other three λLaser (488, 514, and
633 nm) are more favored for M% calculation in the literature.9,18−20,23

S1 and HiPCO samples excited by four λLaser. RBMs

squares correspond to the RBM regions assignable to S- and M-SWCNTs,
respectively. The RBMs measured from the S1 sample correspond to mainly
M-SWCNT at λLaser = 633, while only S-SWCNT at λLaser = 488, 514, and 785 nm.

Figure 3 Enlarged Kataura plot in the range of 150–250
cm–1 (left) and 250–350 cm–1 (right). For comparison, both the chirality (n,m) of an S1 sample measured from ED and (n,m) assignments based on RBM Raman features at λLaser = 488, 514, 633, and 785 nm are indicated in the plot
using the filled blue dots and pink crosses, respectively. The light
gray squares indicate the resonance window widths of 100 meV with ELaser as the centerline.

The M% of sample S1, calculated based on integrated Raman
RBM intensities,
largely depends on the applied ELaser due
to its diameter distribution. Compared to the RBM features of the
HiPCO sample, S1 possesses a much narrower diameter distribution of
1.2–1.5 nm, leading to a significantly narrower range of RBMs
positioned at a lower frequency of 170–200 cm–1 at excitations of 633, 514, and 488 nm. This narrow range of RBMs,
as shown in the enlarged Kataura plot (Figure 3), corresponds to mainly M-SWCNTs
at λLaser = 633 nm, while exclusively S-SWCNTs at
λLaser = 488 and 514 nm. Meanwhile, the Raman feature
of the G– band of sample S1 shows the expected features,
that is, a broad Breit-Wigner-Fano (BWF) shape at λLaser = 633 nm (Figure 2a), indicating the dominant resonant M-SWCNTs,17,57 and a Lorentzian symmetric shape at λLaser = 514
nm (Figure 2b) corresponding
to the resonant S-SWCNTs. When utilizing λLaser of
785 nm, similarly as in the case of the HiPCO sample, only S-SWCNTs
of S1 are in resonance, while the RBM frequencies of S1 are located
at relatively lower frequencies of 200–230 cm–1 due to the larger diameter distribution compared to the HiPCO sample.
To quantify the M% of S1, we integrated the intensities of RBMs at
λLaser of 633, 514, and 488 nm, respectively, which
results in an extremely high evaluated M% of 92–93% at λLaser = 633 nm but 0% when λLaser = 488 and
514 nm. On the contrary, ED measurements yield a M% of 24%. From the
above results, it is clear that the M% evaluated based on Raman RBM
intensity analysis at several discrete λLaser (ELaser) is problematic. Because of the fact that
diameter distribution of SWCNTs determines the range of RBM frequencies,
the resonant M- or S-SWCNTs are then decided by the employed ELaser, as indicated in the Kataura plot. This significant variance in RBM frequencies resulted from
diameter and ELaser, will finally lead
to large discrepancies in the calculated M% values.

These dependencies
of RBM intensities on diameter and ELaser are further confirmed by Raman spectra of the S2
and RM8281 samples, as shown in Figures S2 and S3 (Supporting Information), respectively. First, the S2 SWCNTs
possess a very similar diameter distribution (0.8–1.4 nm) compared
to the HiPCO reference sample (0.8–1.2 nm). However, the presence
of nanotubes with a larger diameter in S2 results in much higher integrated
intensities of RBMs at lower frequencies that correspond to M-SWCNTs
at λLaser = 633 nm and S-SWCNTs at λLaser = 514 and 488 nm. Therefore, the estimated M% of S2 is over 50%
at λLaser = 633 nm but becomes as low as 3% at λLaser = 488 and 514 nm. In contrast, ED measurements of M%
in the S2 sample results in about 33%. Second, in the case of the
RM8281 reference material released by NIST, we measured the (n,m) distribution by both ED and optical
absorption measurements, which revealed that the (6,5) nanotube is
the major chirality. However, it is not at all detected by Raman spectroscopy
at λLaser = 488 and 785 nm. At λLaser = 514 and 633 nm, only minor RBM peaks were observed in the Raman
spectra due to the weak resonance of the (6,5) tube with the excitation
energy.

Further, using SWCNT samples with known (n,m) distributions obtained by ED analysis, we explore
the
sources of uncertainty in an RBM intensity analysis. As shown in Figure 4, the (n,m) assignments are given in the RBM Raman spectra
of the S1 sample using a sum of Lorentzian fitting under λLaser = 488, 514, 633, and 785 nm. The experimental fitting
results with comparisons of theoretical (n,m) assignments are listed in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. For a straightforward comparison,
both (n,m) assignments based on
ED (filled blue dots) and on Raman spectra (pink crosses) are shown
in the Kataura plot (Figure 3), respectively. A typical resonance window
of 100 meV17 is employed for the SWCNT
network films studied here, which is indicated as a filled light gray
area with the ELaser as a center line,
as shown in Figure 3. This means that the SWCNTs with transition energies within ELaser ± 100 meV are all considered for
(n,m) assignments.

Figure 4 RBM Raman spectra of
S1 sample at λLaser of (a)
488, (b) 514, (c) 633, and (d) 785 nm, respectively. The (n,m) assignments are given in the RBM Raman
spectra after the Lorentzian spectral fitting, and the family (2n + m) assignments are denoted as F. The
assignments in blue and red color indicate the S- and M-SWCNTs, respectively.

The RBM intensity of a SWCNT largely
depends on the match of Eii with ELaser. The ED measurements
of S1 show that the (11,9) tube
is the most abundant nanotube with a concentration of 17%, while the
(10,9) tube shows 11%. However, in the Raman spectra obtained at λLaser = 488 nm (Figure 4a), the intensity of RBM from the (10,9) tubes is much stronger
than that from the (11,9) tubes, even when accounting for the possibility
of additional contributions from (15,4) tubes to the same RBM peak
assigned to the (11,9) nanotube. One of the reasons is clearly implied
in the Kataura plot: the E33S transition (2.51
eV) of the (10,9) tube matches the ELaser of 488 nm (2.54 eV) significantly better than that (2.46 eV) of
the (11,9) tube, and the RBM intensity of a SWCNT is a function of ELaser and achieves sharp maxima when ELaser equals an optical transition energy Eii.58 Such ELaser dependence in the RBM intensity
is also observed in Raman spectra at λLaser = 633
and 785 nm, as shown in Figure 4c,d, respectively. A detailed description is provided in the Supporting Information.

Interestingly,
when we reverse the resonance condition of (11,9)
and (10,9) tubes by utilizing the 514 nm (2.41 eV) laser, we observed
the same phenomenon as when using the 488 nm (2.54 eV) laser. The
RBM intensity from (10,9) tubes is stronger than that from (11,9)
tubes, although the E33S of (11,9) tubes is now much better matched
with the ELaser than that of (10,9) tubes.
As seen in Figure 4b, the RBM at 175 cm–1, with a relatively weak
intensity is assigned to (11,9) and (12,8) tubes with a total concentration
of 24%. However, the RBM at 185 cm–1, with a relatively
strong intensity results from (10,9) and (14,4) tubes with a total
concentration of 11%. Therefore, causes different from the underlying
(n,m) abundance and matching of Eii with ELaser should be responsible for the relatively high intensity
of RBM from (10,9).

We ascribe this behavior to a strong mod type
dependence of the RBM intensity, as predicted by theory.34 Previous theoretical predictions34,43,44,59 have shown the significant dependences of RBM intensity on the nanotube mod type (mod = 0, 1, 2), diameter dt, chiral angle θ, and
resonance transition energy Eii. In the current measurement, we can exclude diameter, chiral
angle, and resonant transition energy related variations of RBM Raman
intensity since (10,9) and (11,9) nanotubes are at the same resonance
excitation of E33 by using λLaser = 514 and 488 nm and possess about the same dt of 1.29 and 1.36 nm, and θ of
28° and 27°, respectively. However, the different mod type of (10,9) and (11,9) nanotubes, mod1 and mod2, respectively, has been predicted to considerably
affect their optical properties,58,60 since mod1 and mod2 semiconducting nanotubes
position their transition energies Eii at opposing sides with respect to the K point in the reciprocal space. The exciton–phonon coupling
strengths have been predicted to be very different near the vicinity
of the K point, which dominates the variations in
Raman intensity.34,43,44,59 Recently, Piao et al. published experiments46 on single-chirality-enriched S-SWCNTs, which
have shown that mod2 tubes exhibit an overall higher
RBM intensity than that of mod1 tubes under a Raman
excitation matching with E22. They observed
that the intensity ratio of RBM to G+ mode of (8,3) tubes
(mod2) is nearly 500 times larger than that of (8,4)
tubes (mod1). Since the E22 and E33 of a nanotube are on opposing
sides of the K point, mod2 nanotubes,
which display a strong RBM signal when excited at E22, are expected to show a weak signal when excited at E33. This agrees very well with our observation
that (11,9) (mod2) tubes exhibit much weaker RBM
intensity than (10,9) (mod1) tubes when excited at E33, regardless of their higher concentration
in S1 and even though their E33 better
matches with ELaser.

We can thus
conclude that quantitative or even qualitative evaluation
of M% in a SWCNT sample based on RBM intensities measured at discrete
laser wavelengths is misrepresentative. This misrepresentation is
first due to the strict inverse relationship between RBM frequency
and dt of a nanotube,
the frequencies of RBMs corresponding to M- or S-SWCNTs in a Raman
spectrum can be predicted by their diameter distribution and applied
laser energy but are not proportional to M% or S%. Also one remarkable
peculiarity of Raman scattering from SWCNTs is the dependence of Raman
intensity (particularly the RBM feature) on ELaser in the vicinity of their transition energies.17 Further the RBM intensity of SWCNTs is highly
dependent on (n,m) because of their
different exciton–phonon coupling strengths. Therefore, the
integrated RBM intensities measured by several discrete ELaser depend strongly on the diameter distribution, applied ELaser, and RBM cross-sections of each (n,m) and thereby cannot be reliably used
to assess the M% or S% in a SWCNT sample.

As a solution for
the issues described above, by using continuous
excitation energies in a wide range, Raman spectroscopy could efficiently
detect all (n,m) nanotubes in a
sample. Meanwhile, the dependence of RBM intensity on ELaser could be eliminated by fitting Raman excitation
profiles (a plot of Raman intensity as a function of ELaser) for the maximum RBM intensity of a certain type
of chirality. If theoretical corrections for the (n,m)-related influence on RBM intensity,34,36,39,41,43,44,59 as well as environmental effects,37,61 are taken into consideration, RBM intensities would be exclusively
determined by (n,m) concentrations
in a sample and thus the corrected maximum RBM intensities could be
used to calculate M%.

Evaluation of M% by Counting RBM Peak Numbers
Because
of the apparent drawbacks of the first strategy based on integrated
RBM intensities, it has become fashionable to use the second strategy
of calculating M% by statistically counting the numbers of RBM features
appearing in the M- or S-SWCNT regions of a series of micro-Raman
spectra acquired by Raman spectral mapping.10,11,25−33 Typically, two26,33 to six11 different ELaser have been utilized
to calculate the M% of a SWCNT sample. Because of the nature of this
method, sparsely distributed SWCNT samples on a substrate are needed.
We deposited an S1 sample on a SiO2/Si chip directly from
the FC-CVD reactor with a density of ∼2 tubes/μm2, as shown in the SEM image (Figure 5a). The Raman spectral mapping, consisting
of 256 micro-Raman spectra of the S1 sample at four different ELaser, is shown in Figure 5b–e.

The yellow circles demonstrate the laser spot size of 1 μm that
scans over an area of 60 × 60 μm2 with a scanning
step of 4 μm. (b–e) Series of micro-Raman spectra of

Calculated M% and S% of S1 sample by statistically counting the occurrences
of RBMs in the regions of Raman spectral mapping assignable to M-
and S-SWCNTs.

The M% of S1, evaluated
by statistically counting the occurrences
of RBMs in Raman spectral mapping, is very similar to M% calculated
from integrated RBM intensities at each ELaser. It is observed that the isolated individual S1 nanotubes or small
bundles on substrate exhibit RBM peaks with much narrower peak widths
compared to the RBMs measured from the network film sample (Figure 2), while the RBM
frequencies are located in a very similar wavenumber range of 170–200
cm–1 due to the same dt distribution. This range of RBMs corresponds to
M-SWCNTs at 633 nm and S-SWCNTs at 488, 514, and 785 nm excitations.
Therefore, similarly to the M% values calculated from integrated RBM
intensities, the statistical count of the number of RBM features in
the M- and S-SWCNT regions of 256 micro-Raman spectra at each ELaser yields an extremely high M% of 95% at
633 nm but very low values of 3%, 5%, and 1% at 488, 514, and 785
nm lasers (Figure 5f), respectively.

The final average M% of a sample is dependent
on the quantity and
excitation energies of the applied lasers. In the literature, two26,33 to six11,32 different lasers have been utilized to calculate
the M% of a SWCNT sample by averaging the values of M% obtained at
different ELaser. Here, if two or three ELaser were applied, the calculated M% of S1
can vary from 2% to 50% and 3% to 34%, respectively, depending on
the specific combination of ELaser. Averaging
all four ELaser gives a M% of 26%. Notably,
increasing the number of different ELaser does not simply lead to a more accurate result. For example, the
calculated M% of S1 will increase if the applied ELaser is close to 633 nm (1.96 eV), that is, mainly resonant
with M-SWCNTs of S1 and decrease when ELaser predominantly matches with Eii of S-SWCNTs.

One of the reasons for the large variance
in the obtained M% is
that several laser lines do not efficiently detect most (n,m) in a SWCNT sample. As indicated in the (n,m) distribution of S1 measured by ED,
the M-SWCNTs with percentage higher than 2% are (10,10) (6%), (11,8)
(5%), (13,7) (4%), (12,9) (4%), (9,9) (2%), and (14,5) (2%) (with
diameters within 1.2–1.5 nm). However, among these M-SWCNTs,
only (10,10), (11,8), and (9,9) tubes are detected by 633, 514, 488,
and 785 nm lasers (as indicated in the Kataura plot
in Figure 3), and thus
the four excitation energies used can only excite ∼50% of M-SWCNTs
in S1. Because of such partial detection, even when employing multiple ELaser, it is difficult to reflect the full contents
of a SWCNT sample using Raman spectra. By using prior knowledge of
the diameter distribution obtained by, e.g., optical absorption spectroscopy,
one can roughly select the appropriate ELaser to excite the nanotubes. The (n,m) distribution, that is, whether their Eii match with ELaser or
not, is another important parameter that determines the detectable
percentage of a SWCNT sample.

Meanwhile, if the applied excitation
energies are too close, nanotubes
with (n,m) resonant with all the ELaser will be multiply counted. As an example,
in the present work, the predominant chiralities of (11,9) and (10,9)
tubes in S1 are resonant with both λLaser = 488 and
514 nm and exhibit RBMs at 176 and 185 cm–1 (as
indicated in Figure 5b,c), respectively. Consequently the semiconducting nanotubes of
(11,9) and (10,9) are double counted when calculating M%, which obviously
causes ambiguity in the final results. Therefore, without prerequisites
of the examined samples, it is practically hard to make a proper selection
of a resonance window, that is, the energy interval of discrete laser
lines, to avoid multiple counting or missing counts of the nanotubes.

Further, we observe an unforeseen phenomenon: the occurrence number
of an RBM peak is not a simple function of the underlying (n,m) concentration. As shown in Figure 5b, when excited by
488 nm laser, the RBMs at 176 cm–1 can be assigned
to (15,4) and (11,9) tubes, and the RBMs at 185 and 194 cm–1 correspond to (10,9) and (11,7) nanotubes, respectively. The statistic
count of numbers of RBM peaks located at 176, 185, and 194 cm–1 are 23, 59 and 73, respectively, in the 256 micro-Raman
spectra obtained at λLaser = 488 nm. Within these
four chiralities, the (11,7) tubes (RBM at ≈194 cm–1) with minimal concentration of 4% exhibit the largest occurrence
of 73 times in the micro-Raman spectra, while the most abundant nanotubes
of (11,9) and (15,4) (RBM at ≈176 cm–1),
with a total concentration of 18%, are only present 23 times and (10,9)
tubes (RBM at ≈184 cm–1) with a concentration
of 11% are present 59 times.

Similar to the RBM intensity, we
find that the occurrence frequency
of RBMs in Raman spectral mapping largely depends on the resonant
coupling degrees between Eii and ELaser as well as the chiral
index (n,m). In the Raman spectral
mapping measurement of isolated and individual or bundled SWCNTs on
a substrate, only a few nanotubes either in part or completely, are
under the laser spot at each measurement point and contribute to a
micro-Raman spectrum. Thus, nanotubes of chiralities with larger RBM
cross sections and strongly at resonance with the applied ELaser possess a larger probability to exhibit
a distinguishable RBM feature above the noise, which results in a
higher number of occurrences in the statistical evaluation of hundreds
of micro-Raman spectra. For example, the (11,7) chirality exhibits
the highest number of observed RBM peaks in the 256 micro-Raman spectra
obtained at a wavelength of 488 nm, despite its relatively low concentration
in S1, since its E33 of 2.53 eV is the
most accurate match with the ELaser of
2.54 eV, when compared to other resonant chiralities. Meanwhile, (11,7)
tubes, of the mod2 type, exhibit a much stronger
Raman signal than that of mod1 type S-SWCNTs (e.g.,
(11,9) and (15,4)) when excited to E33, due to the variations in exciton–phonon coupling strength.
Therefore, the count of observed RBM peaks in Raman spectral mapping
assignable to a particular (n,m)
is not simply proportional to its abundance but essentially associates
to the specific Eii in
resonance with ELaser and the RBM cross-section.

In recent years, the second strategy of employing RBM peak numbers
is much more accepted and employed than the first method of using
integrated RBM intensities to evaluate the M% of a SWCNT sample. It
is generally believed that the numbers (the occurrence frequencies)
of RBMs appearing in Raman spectral mapping represent the numbers
(concentrations) of corresponding (n,m) nanotubes on the substrate and thereby can be directly used to
calculate the M% or even (n,m) population
in a SWCNT sample. However, our results disclose a number of comprehensive
factors affecting the RBM peak numbers that occur in Raman spectral
mapping. Ideally, to validate the second strategy for the accurate
calculation of M% of a SWCNT sample, one first needs to carefully
select the range of multiple laser excitation energies to efficiently
detect most of (n,m) in a SWCNT.
In addition, appropriate energy intervals of ELaser have to be considered to avoid either undetected tubes
or multiple counts of the same tube. (n,m)-associated Raman scattering cross sections and environmental influences
should also be taken into account for the quantitative calculations.
Notably, all above-mentioned factors are correlated to the (n,m) distribution of a SWCNT sample. Thus,
in practical measurements, the validation of this strategy for a (n,m)-distribution-unknown sample remains
an open question.

Conclusions
To summarize, in this
work, we comprehensively examine the validity
of the quantitative evaluation of M% on the basis of Raman spectroscopy.
For this purpose, three SWCNT samples with different diameter and
chirality distributions were employed for Raman spectroscopy measurements
at λLaser of 488, 514, 633, and 785 nm. To evaluate
the results of Raman measurements, all three samples were analyzed
with an advanced calibration-free ED technique, giving reliable (n,m) distributions. Our results show that
quantitative Raman evaluations M% at multiple discrete ELaser either (1) by using integrated intensities of RBMs
or (2) by statistically counting the numbers of (n,m)-associated RBMs is misrepresentative. The occurrence
of RBMs in the regions of Raman spectra assignable to M- and S-SWCNTs
at discrete laser lines depends largely on the diameter distribution
of the SWCNT sample; this is because of the relationship between diameter
and the RBM frequency. Neither the intensities nor the occurrence
numbers of RBMs assignable to M- or S-SWCNTs is directly proportional
to the underlying M- or S-SWCNT abundance. In addition, we found for
the first time that the occurrence numbers of RBMs in Raman spectral
mapping depend significantly on the resonant coupling degrees between Eii and ELaser as well as the (n,m)-related RBM cross sections. These dependencies are similar to that
observed in the integrated intensities of RBMs. Furthermore, our results
provide strong experimental evidence of important mod type dependence of the RBM intensity in larger diameter nanotubes
(dt > 1.3 nm). Though
the dependence of Raman intensity on chiral structure of nanotube
has been recognized early, this work advances the understanding of
using Raman spectroscopy for quantitative analysis of carbon nanotube
samples and arouses our awareness of pitfalls associated with this
method, thus paving the way to reliable measurements of M- and S-SWCNT
fractions with quantitative Raman spectroscopy.
