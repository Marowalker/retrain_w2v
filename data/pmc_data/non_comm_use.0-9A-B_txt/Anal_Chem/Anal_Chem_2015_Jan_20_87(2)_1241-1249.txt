As
a driver for many biological processes, phosphorylation remains
an area of intense research interest. Advances in multiplexed quantitation
utilizing isobaric tags (e.g., TMT and iTRAQ) have the potential to
create a new paradigm in quantitative proteomics. New instrumentation
and software are propelling these multiplexed workflows forward, which
results in more accurate, sensitive, and reproducible quantitation
across tens of thousands of phosphopeptides. This study assesses the
performance of multiplexed quantitative phosphoproteomics on the Orbitrap
Fusion mass spectrometer. Utilizing a two-phosphoproteome model of
precursor ion interference, we assessed the accuracy of phosphopeptide
quantitation across a variety of experimental approaches. These methods
included the use of synchronous precursor selection (SPS) to enhance
TMT reporter ion intensity and accuracy. We found that (i) ratio distortion
remained a problem for phosphopeptide analysis in multiplexed quantitative
workflows, (ii) ratio distortion can be overcome by the use of an
SPS-MS3 scan, (iii) interfering ions generally possessed a different
charge state than the target precursor, and (iv) selecting only the
phosphate neutral loss peak (single notch) for the MS3 scan still
provided accurate ratio measurements. Remarkably, these data suggest
that the underlying cause of interference may not be due to coeluting
and cofragmented peptides but instead from consistent, low level background
fragmentation. Finally, as a proof-of-concept 10-plex experiment,
we compared phosphopeptide levels from five murine brains to five
livers. In total, the SPS-MS3 method quantified 38 247 phosphopeptides,
corresponding to 11 000 phosphorylation sites. With 10 measurements
recorded for each phosphopeptide, this equates to more than 628 000
binary comparisons collected in less than 48 h.

==== Body
As a key
mediator of cellular
signaling, phosphorylation remains a principal target for biological
interrogation.1 Identifying and quantifying
the phosphorylation state of proteins involved in cell progression,
metabolism, growth, and disease is critical for the continued elucidation
of cellular function.2 Global phosphoproteome
characterization is challenging due to the estimated large volume
of phosphorylation sites in eukaryotic cells and the often low abundance/stoichiometry
of the phosphoproteome.3,4 Continuing technological and methodological
advancements have resulted in the characterization of tens of thousands
of phosphorylation sites across numerous species, but it is apparent
that only a fraction of all phosphorylation events have been characterized.5−11 Furthermore, phosphorylation dynamics, assessed via relative quantification,
have historically been limited to binary or ternary comparisons, further
limiting the breadth and depth of phosphopeptide analysis.12−17 Novel methodologies are needed in order to overcome the current
shortcomings of phosphoproteome characterization.

Mass spectrometry
remains an unmatched platform for comprehensive
phosphoproteome analysis. Coupling deep identification with relative
quantification has provided valuable biological insights that would
be otherwise unobtainable by traditional biochemical techniques.18−24 Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and
tandem-mass-tag (TMT) based methodologies permit the simultaneous
comparison of up to 8 (iTRAQ) or 10 (TMT) samples, facilitating complex
experimental designs and the inclusion of biological replicates within
the same experiment.

A primary hurdle for isobaric based quantification
technologies
is the presence of interfering coisolated species that result in distorted
reporter ion intensities. A number of publications have documented
this phenomenon, and several have demonstrated approaches to alleviate
the interference.25−31 One such approach was the inclusion of a quantitative MS3 spectrum.32

Recently, the sensitivity of the MS3 method
was dramatically improved
by isolating multiple fragment ions in the MS2 spectrum using isolation
waveforms with multiple notches (e.g., synchronous precursor selection,
SPS).33 The SPS-MS3 method is available
on the Orbitrap Fusion, which leverages advancements in software and
hardware to provide increased scan rates and improved sensitivity,
resolution, and quantitative accuracy. Furthermore, a unique architecture
expands the concept of a hybrid mass spectrometer by incorporating
three mass analyzers (i.e., quadrupole mass filter, quadrupole ion
trap, and Orbitrap) operating in a task parallelized manner.

Here, we assessed the performance of the SPS-MS3 method on two
different phosphoproteome samples. We utilized a 2-phosphoproteome
model of interference to characterize the quantitative accuracy of
various SPS-MS3 and MS2 methods on the Orbitrap Fusion. We observed
that known ratios were distorted for the MS2 method compared to the
SPS-MS3 method. In a large-scale demonstration of the method, we performed
a proteome-wide phosphorylation analysis in 48 h, which compared brain
and liver phosphorylation level differences from five mice in a single
10-plex experiment.

Experimental Procedures
Protein Extraction and
Digestion
Five murine brains
and livers were harvested from CO2 asphyxiated 3-week-old
male Swiss-Webster mice (Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME). Saccharomyces
cerevisiae cells were grown to an OD of 1.0, washed with
ice cold PBS and snap frozen in liquid N2 until further
use. Brain/liver tissues and yeast cells were mechanically lysed with
a homogenizer in SDS lysis buffer [2.0% SDS w/v, 250 mM NaCl, PhosSTOP
(Roche, Madison, WI) phosphatase inhibitors, 2 mM sodium vanadate,
EDTA free protease inhibitor cocktail (Promega, Madison, WI), and
50 mM HEPES, pH 8.5]. Lysates were reduced with 5 mM DTT and cysteine
residues alkylated with iodoacetamide (14 mM) in the dark (30 min).
Protein was extracted by methanol–chloroform precipitation
and subsequent ice cold acetone washes. Pellets were dried and resuspended
in 8 M urea containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.5). Protein concentrations
were measured by BCA assay (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) prior
to protease digestion. Protein lysates were diluted to 4 M urea and
digested with LysC (Wako, Japan) in a 1/200 enzyme/protein ratio overnight.
Protein extracts were diluted further to a 1.5 M urea concentration,
and trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to a final 1/250 enzyme/protein
ratio for 6 h at 37 °C. Digests were acidified with 200 μL
of 20% formic acid (FA) to a pH ∼2 and subjected to C18 solid-phase
extraction (SPE) (Sep-Pak, Waters, Milford, MA).

Phosphopeptide
Enrichment
As the proportion of phosphopeptides
identified from nonphosphopeptide enriched proteomes is routinely
<5%, a sufficient amount of starting material is necessary in order
to produce a phosphopeptide population amenable to LC–MS. Given
the amount of starting material, it is prudent to consider the costs
of TMT reagents. The methods have been optimized to incorporate TMT
labeling post phosphopeptide enrichment, resulting in a significant
cost reduction. For example, TMT labeling post phosphopeptide enrichment
results in at least a 40-fold reduction in peptide concentration,
providing a corresponding savings in TMT reagent cost.

Enrichment
proceeded with some modifications to the method of Kettenbach et al.34 Tryptic peptides (∼10 mg per TMT channel)
were resuspended in 1 mL of 2 M lactic acid/50% acetonitrile (ACN)
and centrifuged at 15 000g for 20 min. Supernatants
were removed, placed in an Eppendorf tube containing 15 mg of titanium
dioxide beads (GL Sciences, Japan), and vortexed for 1 h at room temperature.
Beads were washed twice with 2 M lactic acid/50% ACN and once with
0.1% TFA in 50% ACN. Phosphopeptides were eluted twice with 150 μL
of 50 mM HK2PO4, pH 10, acidified with 40 μL
of 20% formic acid, and subjected to C18 StageTip desalting (3M Empore,
South Eagan, MN).

Tandem Mass Tagging Labeling
Isobaric
labeling of the
enriched phosphopeptides was performed using either the 6-plex or
10-plex tandem mass tag (TMT) reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Rockford, IL). TMT reagents (0.8 mg) were dissolved in 40 μL
of dry acetonitrile (ACN), and 10 μL was added to 100 μg
(Micro BCA, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) of phosphopeptides dissolved
in 100 μL of 200 mM HEPES, pH 8.5. After 1 h (RT), the reaction
was quenched by adding 8 μL of 5% hydroxylamine. Labeled peptides
were combined, acidified with 20 μL of 20% FA (pH ∼2),
and concentrated via C18 SPE on Sep-Pak cartridges (50
mg bed volume). All previously described sample preparation proceeded
the same for both the 6-plex and the 10-plex experiments. Additional
details regarding the 6-plex sample preparation is highlighted below.

Two-Proteome Interference Model
Following phosphopeptide
labeling, the brain and yeast samples were combined. Brain phosphopeptides
were mixed together at 10:2:1:1:2:10 (TMT channels 126–131),
and yeast phosphopeptides were mixed at 10:10:10:0:0:0 (TMT channels
126–128) (Figure 1A). After combining
the phosphopeptides, samples were subjected to C18 solid-phase
extraction (50 mg vide supra).

Figure 1 (A) Murine brain and
yeast lysates were digested and phosphopeptides
enriched by TiO2. The mouse phosphopeptides were labeled
with TMT and mixed at a relative concentration of 10:2:1:1:2:10. Yeast
phosphopeptides were split into three samples, labeled with three
TMT reagents, and mixed 10:10:10:0:0:0. The mouse and yeast phosphopeptides
were mixed (1:1, w:w). If present, interference from the yeast background
would perturb mouse ratios. For all mouse phosphopeptides, the TMT
channels lacking any yeast interference provided control intensities
and ratios. (B) SPS-MS3 method overview. Synchronous precursor selection
(SPS) enables the simultaneous isolation of multiple MS2 fragment
ions increasing TMT reporter ion signal in the MS3 scan.

Basic pH Reverse-Phase HPLC (bpHrp)
TMT labeled brain
and liver phosphopeptides were subjected to orthogonal basic-pH reverse
phase (bpHrp) fractionation. Labeled phosphopeptides were solubilized
in buffer A (5% ACN, 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0) and separated
on an Agilent 300 Extend C18 column (5 μm particles, 4.6 mm
i.d. and 220 mm in length). Using an Agilent 1100 binary pump equipped
with a degasser and a photodiode array (PDA) detector (Thermo Scientific,
San Jose, CA), a 45 min linear gradient from 8% to 35% acetonitrile
in 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8 (flow rate of 0.8 mL/min) separated
the peptide mixtures into a total of 96 fractions. The 96 fractions
were consolidated into 24 samples in a checkerboard manner, acidified
with 10 μL of 20% formic acid and vacuum-dried. Each sample
was redissolved in 5% formic acid, desalted via StageTip, dried via
vacuum centrifugation, and reconstituted for LC–MS/MS analysis.

Orbitrap Fusion Parameters
All spectra were acquired
on an Oribtrap Fusion (Thermo Fischer Scientific) coupled to an Easy-nLC
1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography
(UHPLC) pump. Peptides were separated on an in-house packed 100 μM
inner diameter column containing 0.5 cm of Magic C4 resin (5 μm,
100 Å, Michrom Bioresources), serving as a frit, followed by
25 cm of Sepax Technologies GP-C18 resin (1.8 μm, 120 Å,
Newark, DE) with a gradient consisting of 3–22% (ACN, 0.125%
FA) over 165 min at ∼300 nL/min.

For all experiments,
the instrument was operated in the data-dependent mode. We collected
FTMS1 spectra at a resolution of 120 000, with an automated
gain control (AGC) target of 200 000, and a max injection time
of 100 ms. The 10 most intense ions were selected for MS/MS. Precursors
were filtered according to charge state (required >1 z), and monoisotopic peak assignment. Previously interrogated precursors
were excluded using a dynamic window (75 s ± 10 ppm). The MS2
precursors were isolated with a quadrupole mass filter set to a width
of 0.5 m/z.

During the experiment
where precursors were only analyzed by FTMS2,
the Orbitrap was operated at 60 000 resolution, with an AGC
target of 50 000 and a max injection time of 250 ms. Precursors
were fragmented by high-energy collision dissociation (HCD) at a normalized
collision energy (NCE) of 37.5%.

During the method with FTMS3
analysis, ITMS2 spectra were collected
at an AGC of 4 000, max injection time of 150 ms, and CID collision
energy of 35%. FTMS3 spectra utilized the same Orbitrap parameters
as the FTMS2 method, except HCD collision energy was increased to
55% to ensure maximal TMT reporter ion yield. Depending on the experiment,
synchronous-precursor-selection (SPS) was enabled to include up to
3, 6, or 10 MS2 fragment ions in the FTMS3 scan.

Data Processing
and Spectra Assignment
A compilation
of in-house software was used to convert mass spectrometric data (Thermo
“.raw” files) to mzXML format as well as to correct
monoisotopic m/z measurements and
erroneous peptide charge state assignments. Assignment of MS/MS spectra
was performed using the SEQUEST algorithm.35 The 2-phosphoproteome experiment utilized a protein sequence database
that was a combination of the Mouse UniProt database (downloaded 08/02/2011)
and the S. cerevisiae ORF database (downloaded 02/16/2010).
All other experiments utilized only the Mouse UniProt database. In
each case, reversed protein sequences were appended as well as known
contaminants such as human keratins. In order to prevent inaccurate
interference measurements from peptides shared by yeast and mouse,
the 2-phosphoproteome FASTA database was ordered such that protein
sequences from yeast were listed first, thus ensuring that peptides
matching both yeast and mouse proteins would be assigned to a yeast
protein. SEQUEST searches were performed using a 50 ppm precursor
ion tolerance, while requiring each peptide’s N/C terminus
to have trypsin protease specificity and allowing up to two missed
cleavages. TMT tags on peptide N termini/lysine residues (+229.162932
Da) and carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (+57.02146 Da) were
set as static modifications, while methionine oxidation (+15.99492
Da) and serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation (+79.96633
Da) were set as variable modifications. An MS2 spectra assignment
false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 1% was achieved by applying
the target-decoy database search strategy.36 Filtering was performed exactly as previously described.33

We used a modified version of the Ascore
algorithm to quantify the confidence with which each phosphorylation
site could be assigned to a particular residue. Phosphorylation sites
with Ascore values >13 (P ≤ 0.05) were
considered
confidently localized to a particular residue.11

Determination of TMT Reporter Ion Intensities
and Quantitative
Data Analysis
For quantification, a 0.03 m/z (6-plex TMT) or 0.003 m/z (10-plex TMT) window centered on the theoretical m/z value of each reporter ion was queried
for the nearest signal intensity. Reporter ion intensities were adjusted
to correct for the isotopic impurities of the different TMT reagents
(manufacturer specifications). The signal-to-noise values for all
peptides were summed within each TMT channel, and each channel was
scaled according to the interchannel difference of these sums to account
for differences in sample handling. For each peptide, a total minimum
sum signal-to-noise value of 400 and an isolation purity greater than
75% was required.33

Neutral loss
fragments were identified by parsing MS2 spectra for fragments within
0.2 m/z of the expected mass (based
on precursor m/z and charge state)
and with an intensity greater than 10% of the base peak intensity.

t tests with Welch’s correction for unequal
variances were performed for all mouse brain and liver phosphopeptide
biological replicates. Multiple test correction was performed by adjusting
the calculated p-values according to Benjamini–Hochberg.37 Phosphopeptides with an adjusted p-value < 0.01 were classified as brain enriched, liver enriched,
or commonly expressed. Gene ontology term enrichment was performed
by submitting the three classes described above to DAVID, utilizing
the complete set of quantified phosphopeptides as a background.38 All data analysis was performed using R (R Core
Team, Vienna, Austria, http://www.R-project.org).

Results
Constructing
a 2-Phosphoproteome Model of Interference
To assess the accuracy
of TMT-based quantitative phosphoproteomics
on the Orbitrap Fusion, we constructed a 2-phosphoproteome sample
that contains TMT channels with and without interfering phosphopeptides.
Figure 1A illustrates the preparation of the
2-phosphoproteome model. Following tissue lysis, digestion, and phosphopeptide
enrichment, the mouse brain phosphopeptides were combined at a concentration
of 10:2:1:1:2:10. To introduce interference, yeast phosphopeptides
were mixed at a concentration of 10:10:10:0:0:0 and added to the mouse
phosphopeptide dilution series (1:1 w/w). The resulting sample of
mouse phosphopeptides contained three channels that might display
interference from coisolated yeast phosphopeptides (m/z 126, 127, and 128) and three channels that were
free of any yeast interference (m/z 129, 130, and 131). If present, interference would distort the expected
ratios between channels 126 and 127 (5:1) and 126 and 128 (10:1).
The SPS-MS3 method implemented here incorporated a notched isolation
waveform (up to 10 notches) that isolated MS2 fragment ions based
upon their relative intensity (Figure 1B).

Assessing Quantitative Phosphoproteome Accuracy
We
used the 2-phosphoproteome model to assess the quantitative accuracy
of several MS methods for phosphorylation analysis. Figure 2 shows the normalized TMT ratios for the 5:1 comparison
with and without interference (red trace 126/127, blue trace 131/130,
respectively). Yeast peptides are plotted in green and were expected
to have a 1:1 ratio.

Figure 2 Phosphopeptide mixture was analyzed by LC–MS and
quantified
by MS2 and SPS-MS3 methods. SPS-MS3 performance was further investigated
by varying the number of MS2 fragment ions included in the quantitative
MS3 spectrum (i.e., 1, 3, 6, and 10 precursor ions). (A–E)
Distributions of ratios corresponding to yeast phosphopeptides (TMT
channels 126/127, green trace), mouse phosphopeptides with interference
(TMT channels 126/127, red trace), and mouse phosphopeptides without
interference (TMT channels 131/130, blue trace). Yeast phosphopeptides
(green) are expected at a 1:1 ratio while the mouse phosphopeptides
were mixed at a 5:1 ratio (red and blue). The dashed line depicts
the expected ratio of 5:1. The number of quantified mouse phosphopeptides
is displayed for each method. Quantification via an MS2 method (A)
resulted in significant ratio distortion with a wide distribution
of ratios. Utilizing a MS3 method (B–E) dramatically improves
the accuracy and precision (fwhm) of phosphopeptide quantification.

As has been observed in previous
studies,29−32 TMT reporter ion intensities
derived from MS2 spectra were largely distorted and inaccurate (Figure 2A). We observed that a narrow quadrupole mass filter
isolation of 0.5 m/z did not effectively
correct interference. Furthermore, the ratio between yeast phosphopeptides,
which represented the most intense and easiest measurement at 1:1,
was also distorted, by the mouse phosphopeptides, to a median of 1.2:1.

For each SPS method, the distribution of ratios for the interference
channel followed that of the MS3 single notch method (Figure 2B). Distributions were tight and centered about
the expected ratio of 5:1. However, as more of the MS2 spectral space
was included in the MS3 scan, we observed a subtle shift in the distributions
of ratios (Figure 2C–E). This is apparent
as the difference between the noninterference distribution (blue)
and the interference distribution (red) increased as the number of
notches increased. The correlation between the increase in TMT reporter
ion distortion and the number of notches is likely a phenomenon specific
to phosphopeptide analyses (see below).

Neutral Loss and TMT Accuracy
A common characteristic
of phosphopeptide analysis is the presence of a dominant neutral loss
peak following CID fragmentation. We examined the 2-phosphoproteome
data set to assess the impact, if any, a dominant phosphate neutral
loss fragment plays in quantitative accuracy. Identification of typical
phosphate neutral loss fragments was accomplished by searching MS2
spectra for fragment ions corresponding to the expected neutral loss
masses based on precursor charge state and m/z (see Experimental Procedures).

Figure 3A depicts the proportion of mouse
phosphopeptides with and without a neutral loss fragment (neutral
loss greater than 10% of base peak intensity). An overwhelming 82%
of phosphopeptides exhibited a neutral loss fragment following CID
fragmentation. Among those phosphopeptides that produced a neutral
loss, 70% of the neutral loss fragments were identified as the most
intense fragment in the MS2 spectrum, which translates to 57% of all
phosphopeptides. Across phosphopeptide charge states 2–5, neutral
loss fragments are consistently observed; although, as previously
reported the intensity of the neutral loss decreases as charge state
increases (Figure 3A, inset).39

Figure 3 (A) Production of a neutral loss fragment from the single notch
MS3 experiment was assessed and determined that 82% of mouse phosphopeptides
yielded a neutral loss of phosphoric acid. In total, 50% of the neutral
loss fragments were the most intense ion in the spectrum. (Inset)
A neutral loss fragment was routinely present among charge states
two and three. The intensity of the neutral loss fragment decreased
as the charge state increased. (B) Phosphopeptides containing a rank
one neutral loss, from the single notch MS3 method, were selected,
and the mean relative TMT abundances were determined for each channel
(error bars ± 1 SD). Channels containing interference (m/z 126/127/128) and without interference
(m/z 129/130/131) are shown. Ratios
between channels with and without interference were near expected
values (10:1, 5:1), which indicated that the neutral loss fragment
ion was a viable MS3 precursor ion that maintains the quantitative
accuracy of the method.

For the SPS methods, we observed an increase in the degree
of TMT
reporter inaccuracy as the number of MS2 fragment ions included in
the MS3 analysis was increased. The SPS-MS3 approach utilizes an intensity
based rank order when selecting MS2 fragments ions. That is, for a
single notch MS3 method, the most intense ion will be isolated for
subsequent MS3; for a three notch SPS method, the three most intense
fragment ions will be selected and so on. We believe that the increase
in interference may be due to the neutral loss retaining the bulk
of the precursor ion population, as observed by the rank order intensity
of the neutral loss. The inclusion of additional MS2 fragment ions
via the SPS-MS3 method results in an increase in the amount of MS2 m/z space included in the MS3 spectrum
without a corresponding increase in the target precursor ion population.
This contrasts directly with nonphosphorylated peptides, which exhibit
heterogeneous fragmentation, where additional notches in the SPS-MS3
method will likely correspond to additional fragment ions from the
intended precursor. For nonphosphorylated peptides this ultimately
provides a proportionate increase of m/z space and target precursor ion current (Supp. Figure 1 in the Supporting Information). Therefore, a future
iteration of the SPS-MS3 method could include an online, dynamic adjustment
of the number of notches in order to account for the heterogeneity
of the MS2 fragment ion population.

In order to isolate the
effect, if any, of the neutral loss fragment
on quantitative accuracy, we only looked at the quantitative accuracy
of the population of phosphopeptides where the most intense fragment
ion corresponded to the neutral loss of the phosphate group. Figure 3B displays a summary of TMT reporter ion intensities
for this select group of phosphopeptides from the single notch MS3
experiment. The noninterference channels (blue bars) produced ratios
of 9.9:1 (10:1 expected) and 4.8:1 (5:1 expected). The interference
channels (red bars) produced remarkably similar ratios of 9.7:1 and
5.1:1 (10:1 and 5:1 expected, respectively). This suggests that the
inclusion of a neutral loss fragment within the MS3 method does not
significantly affect the accuracy of the TMT quantitation. Furthermore,
this supports the notion that reporter ion interference may be caused
by species that are not the same charge state and mass as the target
precursor.30,31

Large-Scale Comparison
of Mouse Brain and Liver Phosphorylation
Levels
In order to more fully assess the performance of the
Orbitrap Fusion, when applied to a TMT-based quantitative phosphoproteomics
experiment, we constructed a 10-plex sample comprised of the brains
and livers of five mice (Figure 4A). In addition
to assessing the depth of the phosphoproteome characterization, the
replicate tissue measurements also provided a means of assessing the
overall utility of the entire quantitative phosphoproteomics workflow.

Figure 4 (A) 10-plex
TMT phosphopeptide preparation. Following proteolytic
digestion, phosphopeptides were enriched by TiO2 and labeled
with the 10-plex TMT reagents. Subsequent offline, basic pH reversed-phase
fractionation was employed. (B) The instrument interrogated each sample
using a data-dependent, SPS-MS3 method. Following ITMS2 analysis of
the precursor ions, up to 10 MS2 fragments (light gray bars) were
isolated and further fragmented to provide the quantitative MS3 spectrum.
Reporter ion intensities corresponding to the 10 TMT channels were
normalized, scaled, and summarized for the five brain and liver replicates.

Figure 4B depicts the scan sequence by which
each phosphopeptide precursor is interrogated. First the precursor
ion is interrogated using an ion trap MS2 scan (ITMS2). The precursor
ions are isolated with the quadrupole mass filter and then fragmented
by CID. Online, up to 10 fragment ions (prioritized by intensity)
are noted in the MS2 spectrum for interrogation by SPS-MS3 in the
subsequent scan. Following a reinjection, isolation, and fragmentation
of the MS1 precursor ion, the previously determined MS2 ions are isolated
via a notched isolation waveform. This collection of fragment ions
is then further fragmented via HCD and passed to the Orbitrap (SPS-MS3
or FTMS3). Quantitation occurs by measuring the signal-to-noise (as
a proxy for the number of ions) for each of the TMT reporters.40

In total, we quantified more than 38 000
phosphopeptides
in this analysis. Because of filtering for minimum TMT signal (see Experimental Procedures), the identification rate
was higher such that ∼80% of all the identified unique phosphopeptides
passed all thresholds. This resulted in 11 015 phosphorylation
sites and 2 958 composite phosphorylation sites quantified,
providing 13 973 total quantified phosphorylation forms (Supplementary
Table 1 in the Supporting Information).

In addition to assessing the depth of the phosphoproteome coverage,
we assessed the level of quantitative reproducibility among biological
replicates. An example of the intratissue reproducibility is highlighted
in Figure 5A. For each tissue, the ratio of
one biological replicate to all other biological replicates was plotted,
yielding a narrow distribution of ratios with an apex centered at
a ratio of one. To further highlight global reproducibility, median
correlation coefficients (Pearson) for both the brain and liver replicates
were determined to exceed 0.85. Finally, replicate biological comparisons
displayed remarkable consistency with strong linear relationships
(brain mean r2 = 0.92, liver mean r2 = 0.88) (Supplementary Figure 2 in the Supporting Information).

Figure 5 (A) Biological replicates
were assessed for reproducibility. One
biological replicate from brain (red) and liver (blue) was compared
to all other biological replicates. The tight distributions of ratios
centered about 0 (log 2) indicated good reproducibility. In contrast,
ratios of brain to liver (black) display a wide distribution, highlighting
the phosphoproteome diversity between the tissues. (B) Reproducible
and accurate measurements across all 10 samples permitted the stringent
filtering of tissue-enriched phosphopeptides. Liver (blue) and brain
(red) enriched phosphopeptides were identified through a Welch’s
corrected t test. Vertical lines (blue and red) represent
a 1.5-fold change in expression. In all, 83% of phosphopeptides were
significantly enriched in the liver or brain (adjusted p-value < 0.01).

Obtaining accurate measurements
across all 10 tissues provided
the opportunity to stringently assess the phosphoproteome differences
between the brain and liver. Following a Welch’s corrected t test for unequal variances and Benjamini–Hochberg p-value correction for multiple testing, we observed that
83% of phosphopeptides were significantly enriched in either the brain
or liver (adjusted p-value < 0.01, Figure 5B). The median fold change for brain-enriched peptides
was 8-fold, while liver-enriched peptides was 5-fold.

Scaled
abundances for all quantified phosphopeptides were compared
among brain and liver replicates and plotted in Figure 6A. Nearly half (45%) of phosphopeptides exhibited significant
expression in the brain, 38% exhibited significant expression in the
liver, and 17% had consistent expression across both tissues. Gene
ontology (GO) term enrichment was employed to highlight the fidelity
of the measurements, and significantly enriched terms are highlighted
in Figure 6B. Brain enriched terms included
Synapse (cellular component) and ion channel activity (molecular function),
while the liver specific phosphopeptides matched to GO terms: Transition
metal ion binding (molecular function) and carboxylic acid catabolic
process (biological process). GO terms corresponding to the subset
of commonly expressed phosphopeptides included actin (cellular component)
and DNA binding (molecular function).

Figure 6 (A) Relative abundances of 38 247
phosphopeptides from quintuplicate
biological replicates of mouse livers and brains were plotted. Statistical
comparison (t test, adjusted p-values
< 0.01) provided three clusters representing phosphopeptides enriched
in the brain, the liver, or those that were commonly expressed in
both tissues. (B) GO term enrichment was performed on each cluster
resulting in descriptive terms consistent with the originating tissue.
The dashed line represents the term frequency across all phosphopeptides.
(C,D) Tissue specific pathways highlight the phosphopeptide coverage
and quantitative reproducibility of the sample preparation and method.

With this level of phosphoproteome
coverage, it was possible to
highlight pathways corresponding to phosphopeptides enriched in either
the brain or liver (Figure 6C,D). For each
phosphopeptide, the relative abundance in the brain or liver replicates
is plotted. Figure 6C illustrates a calcium
signaling pathway that was observed to be highly brain specific. As
displayed, Grm5, a G-protein coupled glutamate receptor
initiates a signaling cascade through Gnaq, a signaling
transducer, and production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) via Plcb1 and Plcd1. Stimulation of Itpr1 results in calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum
and activation of Calm1, ultimately resulting in
the control of a number of biological processes including long-term
depression/potentiation, MAPK signaling, and apoptosis. A liver specific
pathway, PPARα signaling, is displayed in Figure 6D. Long chain fatty acids are transported via Slc27a2 and Fabp1. The RXR/PPARα heterodimer is activated by 9-cis retinoic acid, and the presence
of fatty acids results in transcriptional activation of a number of
downstream targets, including those involved in fatty acid transport
(ACSL1 and Dbi) and cholesterol
metabolism (Cyp8b1 and Nr1h3). For
all peptides, the site of phosphorylation was localized via the Ascore
algorithm.

Discussion
Phosphorylation analysis
differs from proteome analysis in at least
two ways. First, phosphopeptide enrichment creates a sample of dramatically
reduced complexity (and potential interference) since most peptides
do not contain a phosphate molecule. Nevertheless, we detected significant
distortion using the 2-proteome model where both proteomes were made
up of phosphopeptides, demonstrating that interference remains a problem
for phosphorylation analysis. The starting amounts for phosphorylation
analysis are up to 100 times greater than for proteome analysis. Thus,
the phospho-enriched mixture from 10 mg of starting material may actually
be of similar complexity to the 100 μg of proteome material.

Second, MS/MS spectra derived from phosphopeptides are commonly
dominated by an intense fragment ion corresponding to the neutral
loss (NL) of phosphoric acid. Prior to this work, there was some concern
that the NL peak might correspond with a significant population of
interfering ions. However, excluding these peaks was not an option
because it would limit the resulting TMT-MS3 reporter ion population
too much. We found that ratio accuracy was only minimally affected
by including the NL peak. Indeed, using a single MS3 notch, which
selected the NL peak as the only source for MS3 ions, did not result
in significant ratio distortion. These results strongly suggest that
ratio distortion is caused by species that are coisolated at the MS1
level and that differ in charge state from the target ion. This finding
is in agreement with the previous work by Coon and colleagues that
demonstrated that an alternative TMT purification technique based
on a proton transfer reaction (PTR) also improves quantitative accuracy.30,31 On the basis of these results, we no longer believe that ratio distortion
is caused by coeluting peptides, which are coisolated and cofragmented.
Rather, we suspect that the majority of interference is likely caused
by sustained, low levels of singly charged fragment ions created through
the electrospray process (e.g., in source dissociation), which are
in-turn coisolated and cofragmented with the target precursor peptide.

Multiplexing experiments with isobaric tags have the advantage
that within one experiment there are no missing values. This is in
contrast to binary comparisons where multiple experiments are required
to compare all samples. For example, we quantified more than 38 000
phosphopeptides. Each phosphopeptide quantified produced 10 measurements
from the 10 reporter ions, greatly facilitating the statistical analyses.
Phosphorylation differences between brain and liver tissue were very
reproducible across biological replicates. Given that the phosphopeptide
enrichment step was performed prior to TMT labeling and mixing, the
enrichment step was also reproducible. This is important because the
alternative would be to label 1 mg or more of peptides with each reagent
and then to combine them prior to enrichment, which would have dramatically
increased the cost of the experiment.

We found that most phosphopeptides
were present at differing levels
depending on their tissue source. Only 17% of phosphorylation sites
were not assigned as significantly enriched in either the brain or
the liver. Sites assigned to the liver or brain were significantly
enriched for gene ontology categories representative of the tissue
of origin. For example, categories such as “synapse”
and “ion channel activity” were frequently identified
in brain and they are representative of the underlying difference
in signaling.

Conclusion
Quantitative multiplexed
phosphoproteome characterization, utilizing
TMT reagents, presents an opportunity for unbiased biological discovery.
The ability to multiplex up to 10 replicates or conditions in a single
sample signifies a landmark shift in throughput, reproducibility,
and robustness of these workflows. While MS2-based quantification
of phosphopeptides via isobaric tagging was found to have distorted
accuracy, utilizing an SPS-MS3 scan dramatically improved phosphopeptide
quantitative accuracy. We demonstrated the technique via the quantification
of tens of thousands of phosphopeptides from five mouse livers and
brains.
