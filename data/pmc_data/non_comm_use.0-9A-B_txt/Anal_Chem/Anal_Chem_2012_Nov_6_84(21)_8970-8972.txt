The performance of rectangular radio frequency (RF) coils
capable
of being used to detect nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) signals
from blister packs of medicines has been compared. The performance
of a fixed-pitch RF coil was compared with that from two variable-pitch
coils, one based on a design in the literature and the other optimized
to obtain the most homogeneous RF field over the whole volume of the
coil. It has been shown from 14N NQR measurements with
two medicines, the antibiotic ampicillin (as trihydrate) and the analgesic
medicine Paracetamol, that the latter design gives NQR signal intensities
almost independent of the distribution of the capsules or pills within
the RF coil and is therefore more suitable for quantitative analysis.

==== Body
Because of the increasing threat
to public health worldwide by the prevalence of counterfeit and substandard
medicines,1 there has been considerable
interest in developing spectroscopic methods of detecting these materials.
Techniques such as near-infrared,2 terahertz,3 and Raman spectroscopy4 have all been successfully used to identify these medicines. A relative
newcomer to this field has been pulsed nuclear quadrupole resonance
spectroscopy (NQR), which can be used to acquire a quantitative assay
of the active ingredient as a means of authenticating the medicine.5 As NQR uses RF radiation, it is noninvasive and,
so, does not require the container to be opened. However, RF coils
need to be used, which will contain the medicine packs of rectangular
cross section, have an acceptable filling factor, and produce the
homogeneous RF fields required for quantitative measurements.6 We describe in this paper such a design.

RF Coil Design
Two variable-pitch coils with a rectangular
cross section (RCS
solenoids) were first modeled using the Vector Fields OPERA RF field
modeling package and then built, the key objective being to create
a homogeneous field within the coil making the return in signal from
a sample independent of the position of the sample in the coil, a
key advance on the performance of fixed pitch coils when working with
pills or capsules mounted in blister packs with differing geometries.
This work builds on earlier work with a cylindrical solenoid6 of variable pitch based on a design by Leifer,7 which was modified to allow for the rectangular
geometry. The RF coils were wound around plastic formers of dimensions
120 × 40 × 85 mm. The second variable pitch coil of these
dimensions is illustrated in Figure 1, which
also shows an example of one of the blister packs containing the analgesic
Paracetamol used in these trials.

Figure 1 Variable-pitch rectangular cross-section
(RCS) solenoid containing
the analgesic Paracetamol and illustration of the contents of the
packet: two blister packs of Paracetamol pills, each holding 8 ×
500 mg Paracetamol pills; cross-section of coil, 120 × 40 mm;
height, 85 mm; turns, 23; inductance (L), 21 μH; Q at 3.03 MHz, 76.

One fixed pitch and two variable-pitch winding
schemes were used;
the first variable pitch coil was a 21-turn solenoid of length 85
mm based on the Leifer equations for a cylindrical solenoid,7 and the second was an optimized version arrived
at by empirically modifying these equations to allow for the new rectangular
geometry. A total of 10 different simulations allowed us to achieve
a better homogeneity. Figure 2 gives the positions
of the coil turns for the resulting optimized coil of 23 turns and
length 96 mm, together with a polynomial approximation to their form
in which the origin is placed at the center of the coil. It should
be noted that the inductance was estimated by assuming that the rectangular
cross-section coil was given the same inductance as a circular cross-section
coil of the same cross-sectional area (i.e., l × w ≅ πr2); in practice,
the two are not very different, although the method by Kostic8 would be more reliable.

of coil.

Results
The performance of all three coils was tested
using a combination
of B1 RF field measurements carried out by a pick-up loop,
and 14N NQR measurements at room temperature (297 K) using
the 3.033 MHz 14N NQR line of Ampicillin (as trihydrate)
and 2.564 MHz 14N NQR line of Paracetamol. For the latter
set of measurements, the pills in blister packs were used such that
the pills were dispersed across the full volume of the coils rather
than concentrated at any one position within them. Figure 3 shows an example of the results of the B1 field measurements.

Figure 3 B1 field measurements along the z axis
of the coil.

The peak B1 as measured is higher for
the fixed-pitch
coil than for either the Leifer or optimized variable-pitch coils.
This can be directly related to the Q of the coils,
which drop from 87 to 84 and 76, respectively.

A comparison
was made between the fixed-pitch coil and the best
of the two variable pitch coils (the “optimised variable-pitch
coil”), as determined by the B1 field measurements.
Initial measurements were made using the two coils of configurations
in which loose Ampicillin capsules were all concentrated either in
the center of the inspection volume or at the top and bottom edge
of the inspection volume, as shown in Figure 4. The 3.033 MHz 14N line of Ampicillin (as trihydrate)
was chosen for these measurements. The line has a width at half-height
Δν1/2 of 1.93 kHz and a temperature coefficient
of −80 Hz K–1. Measurements were performed
at 297 K. A multiple-pulse pulse sequence of the so-called “Pulsed
Spin Locking” (PSL) type was used to acquire the data.9 This is a sequence of the form: P90x (τ – P90y – τ)n, where P90 is a pulse of flip angle equivalent
to 90° of phase either x or y, τ is a delay, and n is the number of times
that the pulses in the train are repeated. The measurements used an
on-resonance PSL sequence with a pulse width of 60 μs and a
pulse separation 2τ of 422 μs; 32 echoes in each PSL scan
were summed, 1000 scans were averaged, and each run was repeated 12
times. The results of the 12 measurements were averaged to produce
the data shown in Table 1.

Ampicillin trihydrate capsules used to test
the coils.

The two coils show a variation in returned signal
that is consistent
with the difference in homogeneity of field, although dulled by the
difference in Q between the two coils.

A second
test of performance was made with a medicine pack containing
pills of the analgesic Paracetamol in blister packs, as illustrated
in Figure 1, at an NQR frequency of 2.564 MHz
and a temperature of 297 K, using the fixed-pitch and optimized variable-pitch
coils; the amido 14N–H signal is a good fit to a
Lorentzian function with a width at half-height Δν1/2 of 2.74 kHz and a temperature coefficient of +70 Hz K–1. The measurements used an on-resonance PSL sequence
with a pulse width of 60 μs and a pulse separation 2τ
of 1.15 ms; 1024 echoes in each PSL scan were summed, 40 scans were
averaged, and the results were repeated five times to give the average
signal intensity.

In a set of measurements designed to offset
effects due to the
difference in Q between the two coils, the mean signals
from the blister packs were compared with those from an identical
number of loose, closely packed pills placed at the center of the
two RF coils (results Figure 5) with a differing
number of pills. All mean values show a linear dependence on the number
of pills, a least-squares fit passing close to the origin, but the
optimized variable-pitch coil clearly shows a much smaller dependence
on the distribution of the pills within the RF coil compared to the
fixed-pitch coil.

placed
in the center of the coil vs an equal number of pills dispersed across
the whole coil volume in blister packs, using a fixed-pitch coil (left)
and the optimized variable-pitch coil (right).

Conclusion
A comparison of the results from the three
rectangular cross section
coils, the fixed pitch, the Leifer variable-pitch, and the optimized
variable-pitch showed that significant improvements could be made
to the B1 homogeneity and sensitivity by variations in
the pitch of the coil, gains that were partly masked by a drop in
the loaded Q-factors from 87 to 84 and 76, respectively. 14N NQR signals from the optimized variable-pitch coil for
Ampicillin capsules and Paracetomol pills showed only a small dependence
on their distribution within the coil.
