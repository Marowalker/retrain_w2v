nanogels enhance the stability and performance of
the exoglycosidase enzyme neuraminidase and are used to create a fixed
zone of enzyme within a capillary. With nanogels, there is no need
to covalently immobilize the enzyme, as it is physically constrained.
This enables rapid quantification of Michaelis–Menten constants
(KM) for different substrates and ultimately provides a
means to quantify the linkage (i.e., 2-3 versus 2-6) of sialic acids.
The fixed zone of enzyme is inexpensive and easily positioned in the
capillary to support electrophoresis mediated microanalysis using
neuraminidase to analyze sialic acid linkages. To circumvent the limitations
of diffusion during static incubation, the incubation period is reproducibly
achieved by varying the number of forward and reverse passes the substrate
makes through the stationary fixed zone using in-capillary electrophoretic
mixing. A KM value of 3.3 ± 0.8 mM (Vmax, 2100 ± 200 μM/min) was obtained for 3′-sialyllactose
labeled with 2-aminobenzoic acid using neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens that cleaves sialic acid monomers
with an α2-3,6,8,9 linkage, which is similar to values reported
in the literature that required benchtop analyses. The enzyme cleaves
the 2-3 linkage faster than the 2-6, and a KM of 2 ±
1 mM (Vmax, 400 ± 100 μM/min)
was obtained for the 6′-sialyllactose substrate. An alternative
neuraminidase selective for 2-3 sialic acid linkages generated a KM value of 3 ± 2 mM (Vmax,
900 ± 300 μM/min) for 3′-sialyllactose. With a knowledge
of Vmax, the method was applied to a mixture
of 2-3 and 2-6 sialyllactose as well as 2-3 and 2-6 sialylated triantennary
glycan. Nanogel electrophoresis is an inexpensive, rapid, and simple
alternative to current technologies used to distinguish the composition
of 3′ and 6′ sialic acid linkages.

==== Body
Sialic acids,
the common name
for N-acetylneuraminic acids, are the terminal monomer
on the nonreducing end of glycans. Sialic acids and enzymes associated
with their synthesis or catabolism are involved in a number of cellular
processes1 and are implicated in physiological
dysfunctions including cancer,2−5 antibody function,6 and
inflammation.7 In proteins, asparagine-linked
glycans contain a common core structure,8 such that can be capped by sialic acids that are adjacent to a galactose
residue. These sialic acid−galactose sequences are linked from
carbon 2 on the sialic acid to carbon 3 or 6 on the adjacent monomer.
The position of this linkage is relevant to cancer,9 and as a result, the linkage chemistry is monitored. Although
there is a critical need for routine sialic acid determinations, the
challenges of linkage analysis, isomerization, and data interpretation
make structural assignment difficult using current analytical technologies.

Oligosaccharides have been identified using benchtop sequencing
with enzymes, but this requires a considerable amount of exoglycosidase
and substantial incubation time.10−14 The cost, stability, and sample preparation related
to the use of the enzyme are limiting factors. Ultimately, separation
strategies that reduce the sample handling and sample volume are critical.
Microflow systems can efficiently screen chemical processes, are more
stream-lined to develop and optimize reactions, and are used to predict
the success of scaling up a method. There are a few barriers to rapidly
assessing enzymatic processing on the microscale, which include the
cost and lifetime of enzyme preparations. These barriers can be overcome
with immobilized enzymes, which can have enhanced performance15 and have increased stability. Methods of covalent
enzyme immobilization require mild derivatization conditions and extensive
optimization, and this has led to the development of new strategies
to physically confine enzymes without covalent modification.16,17

To realize the full potential of enzymes in chemical assays,
enzymes
must be manipulated on the microscale without immobilization. In addition,
the rate of enzyme catalysis must be established for different reaction
conditions because the enzyme rate is specific for each substrate,
and it is dependent upon the conditions used for the enzymatic reaction.
Precise knowledge of enzyme activity can be quantified as Michaelis–Menten
constants (KM), and it is important to harnessing enzymes
for biomolecule recognition, sequencing, and assessment. With this
information, enzyme-based microscale analyses have the potential to
shed light on the relationship between the biomolecular structure
of the substrate and enzyme function. However, new analytical tools
are required that stabilize enzyme performance and consume small quantities
of enzyme in faster analyses.

Capillary electrophoresis has
been adapted to utilize enzymes to
improve detection limits and separation specificity with electrophoretically
mediated microanalysis, commonly referred to as EMMA.18 This method relies upon differences in electrophoretic
mobility of enzyme, substrate, and product for the analysis. EMMA
is rapid, consumes nanoliter volumes of enzyme, and is reported extensively19−22 as a method to enhance detection limits or provide indirect detection.
While not as prevalent, the use of EMMA to determine KM is feasible if the enzyme remains in the native state, the enzyme
does not adsorb to the capillary surface, and the electrophoretic
differences of analyte, enzyme, and product facilitate separation.
Significant optimization is required to ensure that the incubation
conditions are compatible with the electrophoresis, and exquisite
strategies to address this optimization have been described.23−25 These barriers are overcome with the use of phospholipid nanogels,
which self-assemble to form a thermally responsive material that is
suitable as a replaceable gel to sieve DNA in capillary electrophoresis,26,27 as a viscosity switch to close and open channels in microfluidics,28,29 and as a viscous additive to improve capillary electrophoresis separations
of oligosaccharides.30−32 Nanogels are biocompatible materials that immobilize
and pattern enzymes in microscale channels.

This paper outlines
a new approach to EMMA that utilizes nanogels
to physically constrain an enzyme in a separation capillary. Reconstitution
of the neuraminidase enzyme in nanogel at low concentration results
in a longer lifetime upon storage. This provides a means to cost-effectively
use a single enzyme stock solution to deliver the subnanoliter volumes
required for the capillary method. An electrophoretic mixing method
is developed to circumvent diffusion limitation of static incubation.
For the first time, nanogels are harnessed to precisely quantify the
Michaelis–Menten constants of an enzyme with different degrees
of stereospecificity in the presence of substrates with different
linkage positions. The trisaccharide sialyllactose, which is O-(N-acetyl-α-neuraminosyl)-[2 →
3(or 2 → 6)]-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-(1
→ 4)-D-glucose, is used as a model substrate
to characterize neuraminidase. The different catalysis rates obtained
for sialic acid residues with 2–3 or 2–6 linkages are
used to analyze the linkage position of a mixture of 2–3 and
2–6 sialyllactose and in the sialylated triantennary glycan
substrate mixture that contained both Galβ(1–3)GlcNAc
and Galβ(1–4)GlcNAc. Similar results are achieved when
a specific and nonspecific enzyme are used. The approach extends the
nanogel separation method to general as well as specific enzymes.

Materials
and Methods
Preparation and Derivatization of Standards
Enzyme
studies with an anticipated KM in the mM range require
that oligosaccharide substrate concentrations in the mM range be used
to obtain a Michaelis–Menten curve. For the KM studies,
the substrate was labeled with a chromophore detected by UV–visible
absorbance. The chromophore 2-aminobenzoic acid was used as a reagent
to label the oligosaccharides as reported previously.33 The reaction was performed with excess label to ensure
100% labeling efficiency to prevent any bias in the KM measurement.
If the labeling reaction was not complete, then the concentration
of the labeled substrate that was UV-absorbing would have been less
than the total concentration of substrate (i.e., the combination of
labeled and unlabeled substrate) and would confound the measurement
of KM. A ratio of 1400 nmol 2-aminobenzoic acid:200 nmol
sialyllactose (7:1) was achieved by reacting 1 μL volume of
0.2 M oligosaccharide dissolved in water with 1 μL volume of
1.39 M 2-aminobenzoic acid and 23 μL volume of 1 M sodium cyanoborohydride
at 65 °C for 2 h in 0.5 M acetic acid (glacial acetic acid diluted
with methanol). Once the reaction was complete, the reaction mixture
was evaporated to dryness on a Savant SpeedVac concentrator (Thermo
Scientific, Waltham, MA). Excess 2-aminobenzoic acid was removed from
the labeling reaction using a Discovery DPA-6S solid phase extraction
cartridge (50 mg packing material, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) with slight
modifications to a previously established literature procedure.31 Specifically, once the sample was loaded in
the extraction cartridge, the 2-aminobenzoic acid was eluted using
10 mL of 95% acetonitrile, 5% aqueous 1 mM triethylamine, and the
retained sugars were eluted from the cartridge using 3 mL of aqueous
25 mM triethylamine. To ensure that all of the sialyllactose was labeled
and recovered from the purification process, it was compared against
a second reaction performed with excess sialyllactose as described
in the Supporting Information.

Studies
designed to distinguish the linkage position of sialyllactose or glycan
were accomplished with substrate concentrations in the nM range. For
these linkage position studies the substrate was labeled with a chromophore
detected by fluorescence. The fluorescently conjugated oligosaccharides
and glycans were labeled as previously described34 with slight modifications. Glycan labeling was accomplished
using 100 mM 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid in 20% acetic acid
for a reaction of 7 nmol glycan:250 nmol dye in a total reaction volume
of 5 μL. The labeled glycan sample was purified using a 1 kDa
molecular weight cutoff filter (#MCP001C41, Pall Corporation, Ann
Arbor, MI). Sialyllactose labeling was accomplished using 100 mM 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic
acid in 20% acetic acid for a reaction of 5 nmol oligosaccharide:250
nmol dye in a total reaction volume of 5 μL. The labeled sialyllactose
samples were purified using the DPA-6S column as described for labeling
with 2-aminobenzoic acid. Once purified, the samples were dried in
a SpeedVac concentrator before reconstituting to 100 μL in water
and storing at −20 °C.

Neuraminidase in powder was
reconstituted to a concentration of
33.6 mUnits/μL in 50 mM potassium phosphate with the pH adjusted
to 5.2 using 1 M sodium hydroxide. The appropriate volume of master
stock (i.e., less than or equal to 0.52 μL) was diluted with
10% nanogel to a final volume of 50 μL. For both neuraminidase
enzymes, 1 Unit was defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce
1 μmol of methylumbelliferone in 1 min at 37 °C, pH 5.0
from 2′-(4-methyl-umbelliferyl)-alpha-d-N acetylneuraminic acid.35,36

Capillary Electrophoresis
Analyses were performed using
a P/ACE MDQ or MDQ Plus (Sciex, Redwood City, CA) configured by the
manufacturer with laser-induced fluorescence detection (3 mW air cooled
argon ion laser or 3 mW solid state laser, with λex = 488 nm, λem = 520 nm) and a photodiode array
or UV–visible absorbance detector (monitored at 214 nm). A
25 μm internal diameter, 360 μm outer diameter fused silica
capillary (Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ) was used for separation.
Each day capillaries were prepared as previously reported.32 Unless otherwise noted, the background electrolyte
was 100 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid buffered
to pH 7. Phospholipids were prepared as described previously, aliquoted,
and stored at −20 °C.31,32,37 The phospholipid preparation, which was q = 2.5 (i.e., [DMPC]:[DHPC] = 2.5) and 10% phospholipid by weight,
had low viscosity below the gel phase transition temperature and was
easily introduced in the capillary at a temperature of 19 °C
or lower. Prior to each run, the capillary was held at 19 °C
and prepared as previously reported31 with
slight modification as described in the Supporting Information. Data collection and analysis were performed using
32 Karat Software version 7.0 (MDQ) or 10.2 (MDQ Plus). The Michaelis–Menten
curves were fit using GraphPad Prism version 4.03 (San Diego, CA).

Results and Discussion
Patterning Enzyme in Capillary
The
nanogel fixed enzyme
zone was achieved by creating a pseudostationary enzyme plug in phospholipid
nanogel, as depicted in Figure 1. Enzyme prepared in the nanogel was introduced into the capillary
at 19 °C, which was a temperature that maintained fluid-like
viscosity of the material.28,29 At this temperature,
the enzyme was positioned in the thermally controlled region of the
capillary to ensure that the desired temperature was maintained during
analyses. The temperature was then increased to 37 °C to form
a viscous gel28 that maintained the enzyme
position within the capillary and supported the enzyme reaction. Two
model substrates, sialyllactose with different linkages shown in Figure 1, were used. Once
the fixed enzyme zone was patterned in the capillary, as seen in Figure 1, the substrate was
electrokinetically driven into the enzyme zone. Following incubation,
substrate was then separated from product (Figure 1). The catalysis rate of neuraminidase was
quantified by monitoring the conversion of substrate to the lactose
product (Figure 1).
The separation of sialyllactose and lactose did not require the use
of phospholipid nanogel to resolve these analyte peaks. Therefore,
the fixed enzyme zone was embedded in an aqueous solution of 100 mM
background electrolyte buffered to pH 7. The position of the enzyme
zone within the capillary was established by migrating the substrate
to a particular position, incubating substrate with enzyme, and then
separating and quantifying the peak areas of the substrate and enzymatically
generated product. The substrate positions that generated larger product
peak area coincided with the position of the enzyme zone, as summarized
in Figure S-1 in the Supporting Information. With the position of the enzyme zone established, the impact of
nanogel on the enzyme catalysis rate was determined.

Figure 1 Depiction of electrophoretic
migration of substrate in-capillary
containing enzyme in a fixed zone. The 3′- or 6′-sialyllactose
was incubated in enzyme and converted to lactose. The nonreducing
end of the oligosaccharide was labeled with a chromophore (e.g., 2-aminobenzoic
acid, for UV-absorbance detection).

Effect of Phospholipid Nanogel on Enzyme Performance
Proteins
are reconstituted in a variety of additives to maintain
structure and function.38−41 These additives influence both stability and activity
in a complex manner.42 Phospholipids interact
with proteins through different mechanisms.43 Physical constraint of enzymes with lipids has been reported using
edge stabilized phospholipid nanodiscs to study enzyme catalysis of
membrane protein.44,45 Although phospholipids are used
to eliminate nonspecific adsorption of proteins to surfaces,46−48 they are underexplored as an additive for soluble proteins.

To evaluate the effect of phospholipid nanogel on neuraminidase,
the enzyme performance was monitored either in a traditional aqueous
solution of 50 mM potassium phosphate adjusted to a pH of 5.2 with
sodium hydroxide or in nanogel comprised of phospholipid dissolved
in the same aqueous solution. The preparations of neuraminidase were
diluted to a concentration of 350, 250, or 150 μUnits/μL,
and the enzyme activity was evaluated by quantifying the rate of conversion
of sialyllactose substrate to lactose. The rates summarized in Figure 2 demonstrated that
in the presence of nanogel the enzyme retained high activity for the
30-day period regardless of concentration. The stability of the enzyme
diluted in the aqueous buffer was concentration-dependent. The 350
μUnits/μL did not change (Figure 2A). However, the 250 μUnits/μL
(Figure 2B) and 150
μUnits/μL (Figure 2C) enzyme solutions decreased in activity until there was
no detectable activity on days 3 and 1, respectively. The reaction
velocity of 350, 250, and 150 μUnits/μL enzyme was 1100
± 50, 830 ± 50, and 500 ± 40, respectively. At the
highest concentration of 350 μUnits/μL, the reaction velocity
in nanogel was 1.5 times higher than the reaction velocity in aqueous
electrolyte (750 ± 60 μM lactose/min). For the lower enzyme
concentrations, the reaction velocity in nanogel as compared to that
obtained in aqueous electrolyte on day 1 was 1.7 (500 ± 10 μM
lactose/min) and 2.5 (200 ± 10 μM lactose/min) times higher.
These findings were in agreement with literature evidence that lipid
monolayers improve the performance of exoglycosidase enzymes, including
galactosidase49−51 and neuraminidase.52 The
improvement in stability observed at the lower enzyme concentration
may be due to molecular crowding. The compaction of the enzyme by
molecules in the solution maintained enzyme in a folded state and
impacted the enzyme rate if the effective concentration of active
protein was increased.53,54

Figure 2 Plot of enzyme activity. Substrate was
incubated in α2-3,6,8,9
neuraminidase suspended in phospholipid nanogel (10% lipid with [DMPC]/[DHPC]
= 2.5 in 50 mM potassium phosphate pH adjusted to 5.2 with sodium
hydroxide) or in the same aqueous solution devoid of phospholipid
at an enzyme concentration of 350 μUnits/μL (2A), 250
μUnits/μL (2B), and 150 μUnits/μL (2C). Substrate
(5.4 mM 3′-sialyllactose) was incubated in enzyme for 2 min
at 37 °C and separated. Separations were performed at 37 °C
in a 25 μm i.d. capillary, with an effective length of 30 cm
and E = 500 V/cm (reverse polarity).

Optimizing Incubation Times in the Fixed Enzyme Zone
When
enzyme catalysis was performed in-capillary using static incubations,
the measured velocity (Table 1) decreased with increasing incubation time. This diffusion-limited
interaction between substrate and enzyme hindered the quantitative
determination of enzyme performance (i.e., KM values) because
enzyme rates must be consistent regardless of incubation time. In
nanogel electrophoresis, the limitations of diffusion-based transport
of substrate and product were overcome by electrophoretic mixing.
In this electrophoretic mixing approach, the sustained contact between
substrate and enzyme was achieved by alternating the polarity of the
applied voltage to reversibly drive the substrate through the enzyme
zone as depicted in Figure 3. The number of passes and length of each pass were selected
to achieve the desired incubation time. The process of mixing in the
fixed zone was feasible when the position of the enzyme was profiled
in the capillary to determine the zone boundaries as summarized in
Figure S-1 in the Supporting Information. The rate of enzyme catalysis increased with the electrophoretic
velocity due to the increased probability of enzyme–substrate
collision. An Ohm’s law plot was performed (Figure S-2 in the Supporting Information) to confirm that this
was not due to Joule heating. As summarized in Table 1, electrophoretic mixing generated catalysis
with a precision of 9% relative standard deviation for four different
electrophoretic sweep times as compared to 30% relative standard deviation
for four different static incubation times.

Figure 3 Conceptual diagrams of
multipass electrophoretic mixing for control
of the incubation time in the enzyme. The mixing duration was determined
by the total time the substrate passes through the zone. Mixing may
require that passes of different times are combined as in the case
of a 40 s incubation. The positions of the arrows in the zone are
conceptual and do not imply that the substrate traversed from the
top of the zone to the bottom with each successive pass. The electropherograms
were obtained using substrate of 5.4 mM 3′-sialyllactose and
336 μUnits/μL of α2-3,6,8,9 neuraminidase that was
suspended in phospholipid nanogel. Experimental conditions are as
described in Figure 2.

Determination
of Michaelis–Menten Constants for Neuraminidase
The
in-capillary enzymatic method was well-suited to characterize
the relationship between the substrate concentration and the performance
of the rate of enzyme production. The velocity of product formation
was calculated as product concentration/incubation time and then plotted
to determine the Michaelis–Menten constant. An accurate measurement
of enzyme performance required that the classical rules derived for
KM determinations were followed.55 In particular, no more than 10% of the substrate could be converted
to product because the presence of product inhibits the rate of reaction.
An additional consideration was that the amount of product formed
must fall within the linear range of quantification for the method
of detection. A KM curve fit using nonlinear regression
required 2 points at or near saturation and an additional 3 points
distributed across the region where the velocity changes significantly
with substrate concentration.

The application of nanogel for
in-capillary determination of enzyme activity was demonstrated with
a neuraminidase that cleaves sialic acid with an α 2-3, 2-6,
2-8, or 2-9 linkage. Each determination utilized nanogel enzymolysis
with mixing at an enzyme concentration of 336 μUnits/μL
prepared in nanogel. Incubations were performed at 37 °C. Electrophoretic
mixing was performed during the incubation period to obviate the time-related
dependence of velocity on incubation time observed in static incubations.
A set of five electropherograms was obtained with 3′-sialyllactose
at concentrations of 0.40, 1.25, 3.4, 5.4, and 7.4 mM (Figure 4A). The peak area for the lactose
product obtained in each separation was quantified (Figure 4A inset). The rate of enzymatic
conversion was calculated as the concentration of lactose produced
over the incubation time. These determinations were performed in triplicate;
15 values were plotted as shown in Figure 4B and fit using nonlinear regression to obtain
the KM of 3.3 mM with a standard deviation of 0.8 mM.

Figure 4 (A) Electropherograms
of 3′-sialyllactose substrate and
the lactose product generated after enzymatic reaction. The traces
were offset in time by 0.1 min for visualization from the lower to
upper traces at the following 3′-sialyllactose concentrations:
0.40 mM, 1.25 mM, 3.4 mM, 5.4 mM, and 7.4 mM. The increase in the
area of lactose with increasing 3′-sialyllactose concentration
is depicted in the inset. The Michaelis–Menten curve (part
B) was generated by plotting the substrate concentration versus the
rate of product formation for 3′-sialyllactose with 336 μUnits/μL
α2-3,6,8,9 neuraminidase in nanogel. Experimental conditions
are as described in Figure 2.

Literature values have been reported
for neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens with
related sialyllactose substrate.
A KM value of 2.4 with unlabeled 3′-sialyllactose
was obtained using potassium acetate buffered at pH 4.5, 37 °C,
quantifying the product concentration with thiobarbituric-facilitated
colorimetric detection with the alkali-Ehrlich method.56 A KM value of 2.2 ± 0.3 mM with
unlabeled 3′-sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine was
obtained using 50 mM potassium phosphate at a pH adjusted to 5.16
with sodium hydroxide, 37 °C, quantifying the product with anion
exchange chromatography coupled to electrochemical detection.57 KM values are difficult to compare
given that slight differences exist in the hydrolysis reaction conditions.
In addition, the substrate used in this work was labeled with 2-aminobenzoic
acid. In light of these differences in reactions, the experimental
KM value was similar, as it was approximately 1.5 times
higher than these literature values.

The applicability of nanogel
for enzyme characterization was extended
to study changes in the rate of catalysis for different substrates
and different neuraminidase enzymes. The activity and specificity
of α2-3,6,8,9 neuraminidase on 6′-sialyllactose, a substrate
with different linkage positions, were examined using the nanogel
capillary electrophoresis. The results demonstrated the utility of
the method to screen enzymes of different specificity for the conversion
of different substrate molecules. The values in Table S-1 in the Supporting Information were obtained under identical
pH, ionic strength, substrate concentration, and enzyme concentration.
The KM value from the Michaelis–Menten curve for
the general neuraminidase acting on 6′-sialyllactose was quantified
as 2 ± 1 mM (Figure S-3 in the Supporting Information). A similar KM value of 1.2 mM was reported
for general neuraminidase and 6′-sialyllactose with slightly
different reaction conditions (i.e., 100 mM sodium/potassium phosphate
pH adjusted to 5.4, 37 °C).58 The
KM value was 3 ± 2 mM for the specific neuraminidase
cleaving sialic acid from 3-sialyllactose, as shown in Figure S-4
in the Supporting Information. Incubation
of the α2-3 neuraminidase with 6′-sialyllactose resulted
in no production of lactose, confirming that the specific enzyme was
effective at cleaving only 3′ sialic acid residues.

The
KM value was independent of enzyme concentration,
while Vmax was dependent upon neuraminidase
concentration. Curves were obtained at the same enzyme concentration
of 336 μUnits/μL. For this enzyme, the manufacturer reported
that the rate was greater for 2-3 than 2-6.59 The Vmax values (Table S-1 in the Supporting Information), which describe the rate
of enzyme catalysis when fully saturated by substrate, indicated that
the catalytic rate of the general enzyme (i.e., α2-3,6,8,9 neuraminidase)
was five times faster for 2-3 substrate when compared to the 2-6 substrate.
Furthermore, for conversion of 2-3 sialic acid substrate, the general
enzyme was twice as fast as the 3′ specific enzyme. These findings
were utilized to apply neuraminidase to rapidly distinguish the sialic
acid linkage.

Differentiating the Sialic Acid Linkage with
Neuraminidase
With knowledge of the enzyme catalysis, the
application of a fixed
zone of neuraminidase to distinguish sialyllactose linkage position
was demonstrated. A nanogel separation (Figure 5 trace A) of the 6′ and the 3′-sialyllactose
in the absence of enzyme revealed that the 2-6 and the 2-3 sialyllactose
linkages were separated. When a mixture of 2-3 and 2-6 sialyllactose
was subjected to a fixed enzyme zone of 8 mUnits/μL neuraminidase
specific for 2-3 sialic acid linkage, only the 2-3 sialyllactose was
converted to lactose (Figure 5 trace B). Triplicate runs with and without the fixed enzyme
zone generated peaks that had a relative standard deviation in area
of 4% and in time of 1%. These studies were performed using fluorescence
detection. Data found in Figure S-5 in the Supporting Information expanded on these analyses by incorporating a fixed
enzyme zone of 0.6 mUnits/μL α2-3 neuraminidase to confirm
3′-sialyllactose was converted to lactose and not just shifted
in time.

Figure 5 Electropherograms of 3′ and 6′-sialyllactose to demonstrate
the use of α2-3 neuraminidase to determine substrate linkages.
The separation of 3′- and 6′-sialyllactose in trace
A was obtained in the absence of enzyme. Trace B incorporated a fixed
zone of α2-3 neuraminidase (loaded at 69 kPa for 7 s) suspended
in phospholipid nanogel (10% lipid with [DMPC]/[DHPC] = 2.5 in 50
mM potassium phosphate pH adjusted to 5.2 with sodium hydroxide) at
a concentration of 8 mUnits/μL to distinguish 2-3 from 2-6 sialyllactose
by cleaving all the sialic acid on the 3′-sialyllactose. Separations
and incubations were performed at 37 °C in a 25 μm i.d.
capillary filled with nanogel, with an effective length of 50 cm and
E = 400 V/cm (reverse polarity).

A similar strategy to identify the sialic acid linkage was
applied
to the mixture of trisialylated triantennary complex N-glycan shown
in Figure 6. The N-glycan
determinations were accomplished using the fixed nanogel enzyme zone
embedded in capillary filled with an enzyme-free nanogel. A nanogel
separation (Figure 6 trace A) of the N-glycan in the absence of enzyme revealed that
the N-glycan was fully sialylated and contained both Galβ(1–3)GlcNAc
and Galβ(1–4)GlcNAc. These isomers were resolved electrophoretically
when the capillary was filled with nanogel.30 The separation in trace B was obtained with a fixed zone of 80 mUnits/μL
α2-3 neuraminidase, resulting in complete cleavage of the 2-3
linked sialic acid. A higher concentration and larger fixed enzyme
zone increased the relative standard deviation in area to 11% and
in time to 2% (n = 3), but was required to desialylate
the trisialylated N-glycan. No product peaks were generated that contain
two sialic acids. A product peak associated with asialo N-glycan (Figure 6 trace A) comprised
<1% of the area of the N-glycan peaks. The peaks obtained in these
traces indicated that two-thirds of the sialic acid linkages were
2-3, while one-third were 2-6.

Figure 6 Electropherograms of 0.15 nM trisialylated
triantennary complex
N-glycan incubated in α2-3 neuraminidase to determine linkage
position. Trace A was obtained without enzyme, while trace B was obtained
using 80 mUnits/μL α2-3 neuraminidase suspended in phospholipid
nanogel. The fixed zone of α2-3 neuraminidase (loaded at 69
kPa for 35 s) generated an electropherogram of N-glycan devoid of
all 2-3 linked sialic acid. The peak marked with the asterisk was
present in the reaction blank. Experimental conditions were the same
as those used in Figure 5.

To demonstrate that different
catalytic rates of general neuraminidase
for 2-3 vs 2-6 sialic acid linkages could be harnessed to distinguish
linkage position, the experiment was repeated using general neuraminidase.
The separation in trace A of Figure 7 was obtained without enzyme, while the separation
in trace B was obtained with a fixed enzyme zone of 4 μUnits/μL
general neuraminidase. This resulted in complete cleavage of the 2-3
linked sialic acid. Triplicate runs with the fixed zone of general
enzyme generated peaks that had a relative standard deviation in area
of 10% and in time of 2%. No product peaks were generated that contained
two sialic acids. The separation in trace C of Figure 7 was obtained with a fixed zone of 2.4 mUnits/μL
general neuraminidase, resulting in complete cleavage of sialic acid.
The same sialic acid linkage composition obtained with specific enzyme
was obtained using general enzyme by controlling the concentration
of the general neuraminidase.

Figure 7 Electropherograms of 0.15 nM trisialylated triantennary
complex
N-glycan incubated in 2-3′,6′,8′,9′ neuraminidase
to determine the 3′ versus 6′ sialic acid composition.
The separation in trace A was obtained in the absence of enzyme. The
separation in trace B was obtained using 4 μUnits/μL α2-3,6,8,9
neuraminidase suspended in phospholipid nanogel (loaded at 69 kPa
for 21 s) and generated an electropherogram of N-glycan devoid of
all 2-3 linked sialic acid. The fixed zone of 2.4 mUnits/μL
α2-3,6,8,9 neuraminidase used in trace C (loaded at 69 kPa for
21 s) generated an electropherogram of N-glycan devoid of all sialic
acid. The experimental conditions are the same as those used in Figure 5.

Conclusions and Future Directions
Nanogels are a biocompatible separation additive. At a concentration
of 150 μUnits/μL, enzyme reconstituted in aqueous electrolyte
has a rate that is approximately half of what is obtained when it
is reconstituted in nanogel made in the same aqueous solution. Furthermore,
when the preparation does not contain nanogel, the activity decreases
dramatically at an enzyme concentration of 150 μUnits/μL
such that product was not detectable on the second day of measurement.
In contrast, neuraminidase reconstituted in nanogel maintained a rate
of 500 ± 40 μM lactose/min, as seen in the generation of
product measured throughout a 30-day period. A single enzyme stock
in nanogel is a cost-effective means to deliver the subnanoliter volumes
required for the capillary method.

Nanogel preparations are
inexpensive, costing $0.09 for 5 μL.60,61 The nanogel enzyme analyses provide an inexpensive, rapid, and simple
means to analyze and quantify the linkage composition of oligosaccharides
and are an alternative technology to current methods that rely on
derivatization or benchtop digestion. Although the specific enzyme
provides greater confidence in the glycan linkage composition, the
same information is achievable with the general enzyme that has preferential
catalytic specificity for one substrate linkage over another, such
as the α2-3,6,8,9 neuraminidase. This is particularly useful
in cases where a specific enzyme is not readily available (e.g., α2-8
or α2-9 specific sialidases) or is prohibitively expensive.
The method will be harnessed to determine the linkage composition
in mixtures of complex N-glycans. Future efforts will also center
on adapting the method for different enzymes.
