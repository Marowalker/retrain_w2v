G-quadruplexes
are nucleic acids structures stabilized by physiological
concentration of potassium ions. Because low stability G-quadruplexes
are hardly detectable by mass spectrometry, we optimized solvent conditions:
isopropanol in a triethylamine/hexafluoroisopropanol mixture highly
increased G-quadruplex sensitivity with no modification of the physiological
G-quadruplex conformation. G-quadruplexes/G-quadruplex-ligand complexes
were also correctly detected at concentration as low as 40 nM. Detection
of the physiological conformation of G4s and their complexes opens
up the possibility to perform high-throughput screening of G-quadruplex
ligands for the development of drug molecules effective against critical
human diseases.

==== Body
G-quadruplexes
(G4s) are noncanonical
nucleic acid structures, which form in guanine (G)-rich sequences
by G-quartet stacking, and are stabilized by potassium (K+), the most relevant intracellular monovalent cation.1,2 G4s may adopt different conformations, i.e., parallel, antiparallel,
or hybrid, depending on their strand orientation.3 G4s are involved in the modulation of important biological
processes in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses.4−11 In eukaryotes and viruses, the use of G4-ligands has shown promising
therapeutic activity.12−15 Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful
tool to investigate both G4 structure and G4/small molecule binding.16 To this aim, G4s need to maintain their native
conformation. The main problem is that G4s are folded in physiological
concentration of K+ (100–150 mM), which strongly
hampers G4 detection and data quality in ESI-MS. To circumvent this
problem, different approaches have been developed: (i) substitution
of K+ with the volatile NH4+ ion,
which fits in the G4;17,18 however, G4s folded in NH4+ often adopt nonphysiological conformations.19 (ii) G4 folding in physiological concentration
of K+ and removal of the noncoordinated ions by filtration
or ethanol precipitation;20,21 this approach is suitable
only for stable G4s with slow unfolding kinetics in low K+ concentration. (iii) G4 folding in MS-compatible amounts of K+ (<1 mM) in the presence of a volatile bulky buffer (e.g.,
triethylammonium acetate (TEAA) or trimethylammonium acetate (TMAA)22); the rationale is that the bulky buffer does
not fit into the G4 cavity and thus it does not prevent K+ from coordinating the G4, but it provides physiological ionic strength.
Using this approach we obtained very good results in MS detection
of stable G4s, but we observed weak detection and resolution of low
stability G4s. We thus deemed it worth searching for new solvent conditions
to favorably compare with the TMAA-based method.

Experimental Section
Oligonucleotides
Oligonucleotides were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy, and used without further purification.
Five G4s were tested: two form in the human immunodeficiency virus-1
(HIV-1) LTR promoter (LTR-III and LTR-IV),8 one in the herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) genome (un2)12 and two in the human chromosome, at telomeres
(hTel) and in the promoter of the c-myc oncogene (c-myc) (Table S1). Oligonucleotides (5 μM) in 1
mM KCl (Fluka, St. Louis, MO), 150 mM trimethylammonium acetate (TMAA)
(Fluka) pH 7.4 (adjusted from pH ∼7 to 7.4 with triethylamine
(TEA) (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA)) were annealed by heating at 95 °C
for 5 min, gradually cooled to room temperature, added of 20% of isopropanol
(IPA) (Carlo Erba Reagenti S.p.A, Milan, Italy) or 20% of water and
incubated overnight at 4 °C (final buffer composition, 0.8 mM
KCl, 120 mM TMAA pH 7.4, (20% IPA)). Alternatively oligonucleotides
(5 μM) in 1 mM KCl, 150 mM of hexafluoroisopropanol (Across,
Pittsburgh, PA) neutralized to pH 7.4 with TEA (TEA/HFIP) were annealed
by heating at 95 °C for 5 min, gradually cooled to room temperature,
added of 20% of IPA or 20% of water and incubated overnight at 4 °C
(final buffer composition: 0.8 mM KCl, 120 mM TEA/HFIP, pH 7.4, 20%
IPA). BRACO-19 (Endotherm Life Science, Saarbrücken, Germany)
was added to the annealed G4 at G4/compound molar ratio 1:2 and incubated
one more day before analysis.

Mass Spectrometry Analysis
Samples were analyzed by
direct infusion electrospray ionization (ESI) on a Xevo G2-XS QTOF
mass spectrometer (Waters, Manchester, U.K.). This is a high-resolution
instrument that allowed us to visualize the isotopic pattern, identify
the charge state, and therefore unambiguously calculate the neutral
mass of the detected species. The injection was automatically performed
by an Agilent 1290 Infinity HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
CA) equipped with an autosampler; the carrying buffer was TMAA 120
mM pH 7.4 with/without 20% IPA or TEA/HFIP 120 mM pH 7.4 with/without
20% IPA. A volume of 5 μL of each sample were typically injected
for each analysis. In all experiments, ESI source settings were: electrospray
capillary voltage 1.8 kV; source and desolvation temperatures 45 and
65 °C, respectively; sampling cone voltage 65 V. All these parameters
ensured minimal fragmentation of the DNAs complexes. The instrument
was calibrated using a 2 mg/mL solution of sodium iodide in 50% of
IPA. Additionally, the use of the LockSpray during analysis provided
a typical <5 ppm mass accuracy. The internal standard LockSpray
consisted in a solution of leu-enkephalin 1 μg/mL in acetonitrile/water
(50:50, v/v) containing 0.1% of formic acid. When comparing the same
samples in different buffers, spectra were acquired the same day to
avoid signal decrease due to source contamination.

Circular Dichroism
Analysis
CD spectra were recorded
on a Chirascan-Plus (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, U.K.) equipped
with a Peltier temperature controller set at 20 °C, using a quartz
cell of 5 mm optical path length, scanning at 1 nm bandwidth, 0.2
nm step size, and at 0.3 s per point over a wavelength range of 230–320
nm. Observed ellipticities were converted to molar ellipticity ([θ]
= deg × cm2 × dmol–1). Oligonucleotides
(5 μM) in 1–100 mM KCl, 150 mM TMAA (unless otherwise
specified) or 20 mM potassium phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) buffer pH 7.4 were annealed by heating at 95 °C for 5 min,
gradually cooled to room temperature, added 20% of the indicated solvent
(Sigma or Carlo Erba) or 20% of water, and incubated overnight at
4 °C. Oligonucleotides in TEA/HFIP were annealed as previously
discussed.

Results and Discussion
The conformation
of the viral (LTR-III, LTR-IV, un2) and cellular
(hTel and c-myc) G4s (Table S1) was initially
tested. In 100 mM K+, LTR-IV folds in a bulged parallel
G423 with Tm of 50 °C. LTR-III8 and hTel24 are hybrid G4 with Tm of 68 °C, while c-myc and un2 display parallel and antiparallel
topology, respectively, and Tm > 90
°C.12,25 To assess the G4 conformation of the tested
sequences in different
buffer conditions, circular dichroism (CD) was used (Figure S1a). In 100 mM K+ and phosphate buffer,
LTR-IV and c-myc showed a parallel G4 CD signature with one maximum
at 260 nm and one minimum at 240 nm. LTR-III and hTel displayed a
hybrid-like spectrum: LTR-III had a maximum at 260 nm and a shoulder
at 290 nm, hTel a maximum at 290 nm and a shoulder at 250 nm; both
structures displayed a minimum at 235–240 nm. Un2 displayed
a typical antiparallel G4 structure with a minimum at 260 and two
maxima at 240 and 290 nm.26 Substitution
of the phosphate buffer with trimethylammonium acetate (TMAA) buffer,
the cation of which is too bulky to fit the G4,22 did not lead to any CD-detectable structure modification,
as long as the total ion concentration was maintained constant and
K+ was kept above 10 mM (Figure S1a). When K+ concentration was reduced to 10 mM or below,
decreased molar ellipticity was observed for LTR-IV, indicating less
oligonucleotide folded into G4; yet the parallel conformation was
maintained. LTR-III remained at the same fully folded conformation
at both 100 and 10 mM K+, however at 0.8 mM K+ the molar ellipticity dramatically decreased and a structural change
was monitored as inversion of relative peak intensity at 260 and 290
nm. HTel displayed a similar pattern, with identical CD spectra at
100 and 10 mM K+, turning into the CD signature characteristic
of an antiparallel structure at 0.8 mM K+. In contrast,
the structures with higher Tm (i.e., c-myc
and un2) were poorly affected by K+ decrease (Figure S1a). These data indicate that low K+ concentration in TMAA is not optimal for several G4s, since
they undergo conformational changes.

To perform MS of G4s maintaining
stability and conformation as
close as possible to those in 100 mM K+, we initially explored
the effect of organic solvents on G4-folding in TMAA. It has been
reported that the presence of primary alcohols promotes G4-folding
due to crowding effect27 and to water release
during G4 assembly.28,29 Several organic solvents in 120
mM TMAA and 0.8 mM K+ were tested by CD for their effectiveness
in promoting the physiological G4 conformation of LTR-IV. Isopropanol
(IPA), acetonitrile, and methanol proved to be the most effective
in stabilizing LTR-IV G4, whereas ethanol was slightly less efficient
(Figure S1b). Molar ellipticity substantially
increased after addition of 20% organic solvent to the TMAA solution
with 0.8% K+, with the CD spectrum becoming practically
identical to that measured in 100 mM K+, confirming the
strong G4-folding-inducing properties of organic solvents (Figure S1b). IPA, being less toxic than methanol
and acetonitrile, was chosen for further MS-buffer optimization. Molar
ellipticity of LTR-IV G4 was proportional to the amount of solvent
in the buffer, reaching a plateau at 30% of IPA; at 20% IPA the CD
spectrum of LTR-IV G4 was similar to that measured in 100 mM K+ (Figure S1c), therefore 20% IPA
was used in the following buffer optimization process. The G4-stabilizing
effect of 20% IPA was maintained also on LTR-III and hTel, whereas
un2 and c-myc were not modified (Figure 1a), in line with the previously observed
stability of these G4s (Figure S1a).

the tested sequences in the different buffers optimized

charge distribution in the indicated buffers.

MS spectra in the presence/absence of IPA were obtained to
confirm
G4 folding by assessing the number of coordinated K+ ions,
which are diagnostic for the number of G-quartets involved in the
G4 structure (Figure 1b and Figure S2). The MS spectrum of LTR-IV
in TMAA 0.8 mM K+ presented a major peak corresponding
to LTR-IV and peaks of lower intensity that corresponded to LTR-IV-K+ adducts, which displayed a salt concentration-dependent statistical
distribution, suggesting nonspecific K+ binding. The use
of IPA drastically modified the spectrum: the intensity of the free
DNA and 1K+-adduct became much lower compared to the 2K+-adduct. The 2K+-adduct is consistent with the
reported structure of LTR-IV G4, comprising three G-quartets coordinating
two K+23. The same rationale
applies to LTR-III: in the absence of IPA the peak of the free LTR-III
and small amounts of 1K+- and 2K+- adducts were
present; upon addition of IPA, the peak corresponding to the 2K+-adduct became the main peak and those corresponding to the
free LTR-III and 1K+-adducts disappeared. The behavior
of hTel DNA was more complex: in the absence of IPA, hTel mainly showed
1K+- and 2K+-adducts, consistently with formation
of two and three G-quartets. Addition of IPA increased the intensity
of the 2K+-adduct compared to the 1K+-adduct,
which however remained intense. These data are in line with the different
G4 conformations adopted by the telomeric sequence, including “form
3” that displays two G-quartets coordinating one K+.30 MS spectra of un2 and c-myc showed
the presence of a 3K+ and 2K+-adduct, respectively,
which is consistent with their reported G4 structures12,25 and IPA addition did not affect K+-adduct distribution
(Figure 1b and Figure S2). Relative peak intensity and K+-adduct distribution (Table 1) indicate that addition of 20% IPA positively influences
MS detection of the least stable G4s (i.e., LTR-IV, LTR-III, and hTel),
whereas it does not perturb the most stable G4s (i.e., un2 and c-myc).

the intensity of the free DNA (no K) or K+ adducts (1K+, 2K+, 3K+, 4K+). The intensity
is normalized to the sum of the intensities of all species (no K,
1K+, 2K+, 3K+, 4K+) and
expressed in %. All charge states present in the spectra were included
in the calculation; charge states per each sample are indicated. Each
sample was assayed at least three times and standard deviation is

within each spectrum, is shown.

The ability of triethylamine/hexafluoroisopropanol (TEA/HFIP) to
improve MS detection of nucleic acids has been described.31,32 We initially compared by CD the effect of TEA/HFIP/IPA vs TMAA/IPA
on G4-folding. All oligonucleotides essentially maintained the same
conformation in TEA/HFIP/IPA and TMAA/IPA (Figure 1a), with the exception of hTel, which in
TEA/HFIP/IPA increased at 265 nm and decreased at 250 nm. K+-adduct distribution in the two buffers was next tested by ESI/MS
(Figure 1b and Figure S2): all G4s displayed similar MS spectra
in the two buffers, with hTel representing the only exception: in
TEA/HFIP ± IPA, the peaks corresponding to the 1K+-adduct almost disappeared. The hTel 1K+-adduct likely
represents hTel G4 form 3: in the same buffer conditions, the CD spectrum
exhibited a decrease of the shoulder at 250 nm, reported as characteristic
of hTel G4 form 3.30 K+-adduct
distribution of the tested G4s in TEA/HFIP buffer in the presence/absence
of 20% IPA are summarized in Table 1: as in the case of TMAA, the presence of IPA highly
increased detection of MS peaks corresponding to the fully folded
G4s, especially with the least stable G4s, i.e., LTR-IV, LTR-III,
and hTel. In TEA/HFIP/IPA, however, and in contrast to what was observed
in TMAA/IPA, peaks corresponding to the folded G4 increased also for
the most stable G4s, i.e., un2 and c-myc. In general, peak intensity
was highly augmented in TEA/HFIP ± IPA: the most intense peak
(base peak) in each MS spectrum increased by 1 order of magnitude
in TEA/HFIP/IPA vs TMAA/IPA (Figure 1c). In addition, charge distribution in TEA/HFIP and
TMAA was different: for instance, LTR-IV in TEA/HFIP/IPA presented
peaks with charge states from 3– to 9–, whereas in TMAA/IPA
4– and 5– charge states only were detected (Figure 1d). K+ binding was not altered in TEA/HFIP/IPA buffer: more than 95% of
peaks with charge state 7– corresponded to LTR-IV coordinated
to two K+; when considering all charge states, the intensity
of 2K+-adducts, indicating full G4-folding, represented
more than 90% of the intensity of all peaks (Table 1). Around 4% peak intensity corresponded
to free DNA, diagnostic of the unfolded oligonucleotide, and similar
percentage to multi-K+ or TEA adducts, mostly at lower
charge states (4–, 3−) (Figure 1d). Similar results were obtained for LTR-III,
c-myc, and un2 (Table 1). The hTel sequence showed a different behavior: in TEA/HFIP/IPA,
around 62% of the peaks corresponded to 2K+-adducts and
27% to free DNA (Table 1). In contrast, in TMAA/IPA around 45% and 25% of peaks corresponded
to 2K+-and 1K+-adducts, respectively, and no
free DNA was detected, suggesting some conformational difference of
hTel in the two buffers. In general the high charge peaks retained
the G4-diagnostic K+, while aspecific salt-adducts were
absent, expediting the assignments of the correct number of G-quartets.
We ascribe the multicharge effect to the lower amount of R3NH+ ions in HFIP/TEA vs TMAA. In fact, TMAA at 120 mM
pH 7.4 roughly consists of equimolar amounts of trimethylamine (pKb 4.2) and acetic acid (pKa 4.8); in contrast, the amount of triethylamine (pKb 3.3) necessary to neutralize a solution of
120 mM-HFIP (pKa 9.3) is considerably
lower (<5 mM), yielding a relatively low concentration of triethylammonium
salt. This low salt concentration on one hand reduces the neutralization
of the phosphate groups and thus increases the DNA charge states detected
by ESI-MS; on the other, it reduces signal suppression hence raising
the ESI signal intensity.31 Thus, while
in general terms multicharging of biomolecules depicts denaturation,
in this case the salt effect increases G4 conformation and MS detection,
as corroborated by CD analysis (Figure 1a) and MS detection of coordinated K+ ions
(Figure 1b and Figure S2) and of G4-bound ligand (Figure 2a,b and Figure S3).

buffers. (a) LTR-IV was incubated with 2 equivalents of B19 in 0.8
mM K+, 20% IPA, and either TMAA 120 mM pH 7.4 (left panel)
or TEA/HFIP 120 mM pH 7.4 (right panel). (b) HTel 4 μM in the
absence (left panel) or presence (right panel) of 1 equiv of B19 in
TEA/HFIP 120 mM pH 7.4, 0.8 mM KCl, and 20% IPA. The red X symbols
indicate the absence of adducts between the unstructured hTel and
B19.

We next compared detection of
G4-ligand complexes in TEA/HFIP vs
TMAA. BRACO-19 (B19) was used as a reference ligand, since it has
been shown to interact with most G4s and, in particular, with all
those used in this study.8,12,33,34 When B19 was added to LTR-IV
at 1:2 G4/B19 molar ratio in 0.8 mM K+, 20% IPA, and 120
mM TEA/HFIP, molecular masses corresponding to LTR-IV with both one
and two bound B19 molecules were detected. The base peak corresponding
to LTR-IV/2K+/1B19 had a charge state 7– (Figure 2a and Figure S3b). In contrast, in 120 mM TMAA, only
the complex with one B19 was observed (LTR-IV/2K+/1B19),
the base peak charge state was 4– and the intensity ∼10-fold
lower (Figure 2a and Figure S3a). We next checked the degree of specific
binding obtainable in TEA/HFIP: we tested the binding of B19 to hTel,
which in TEA/HFIP is present both as G4-folded and unfolded DNA. In
the presence of B19, only K+-adducts (1K+ and
2K+) bound to B19 were found, while no B19 was detected
bound to the free unstructured DNA, indicating that a stringent specificity
of binding was maintained in TEA/HFIP (Figure 2b and Figure S3c). Because signal intensity in TEA/HFIP was very high, we tested
the possibility to analyze diluted samples: LTR-IV + 2K+ either free or bound to one molecule of B19 was detected at G4 concentration
as low as 40 nM (Figure S4c). At higher
concentration (i.e., 400 nM, 4 μM) LTR-IV + 2K+ with
two molecules of B19 was also detected (Figure S4a,b). The increased sensitivity in TEA/HFIP allows decreasing
the concentration of both target molecule and ligand minimizing aspecific
binding, if present.

Conclusions
The possibility to increase
MS signal intensity without affecting
physiological folding enables the analysis of G4s and G4-small molecule
adducts in the submicromolar range. This feature can be exploited
for high-throughput screening of complex mixtures of ligands on a
folded nucleic acid scaffold and therefore for the development of
drug molecules effective against significant human diseases.
