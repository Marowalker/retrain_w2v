Protein ubiquitin modifications present
a vexing analytical challenge,
because of the dynamic changes in the site of modification on the
substrate, the number of ubiquitin moieties attached, and the diversity
of linkage patterns in which they are attached. Presented here is
a method to confidently assign size and linkage type of polyubiquitin
modifications. The method combines intact mass measurement to determine
the number of ubiquitin moieties in the chain with backbone fragmentation
by 193-nm ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) to determine the linkage
pattern. UVPD fragmentation of proteins leads to reproducible backbone
cleavage at almost every inter-residue position, and in polyubiquitin
chains, the N-terminally derived fragments from each constituent monomer
are identical, up to the site of conjugation. The N-terminal ubiquitin
fragment ions are superimposed to create a diagnostic pattern that
allows easy recognition of the dominant chain linkages. The method
is demonstrated by achieving almost-complete fragmentation of monoubiquitin
and then, subsequently, fragmentation of dimeric, tetrameric, and
longer Lys48- and Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains. The utility of the
method for the analysis of mixed linkage chains is confirmed for mixtures
of Lys48 and Lys63 tetramers with known relative concentrations and
for an in vitro-formulated ubiquitin chain attached
to a substrate protein.

==== Body
Ubiquitin is a small, 76-residue
protein conserved among eukaryotes,1 and
its conjugation to proteins to form polyubiquitin chains of various
lengths and geometries is implicated in almost every aspect of cell
biology.2 Ubiquitin is covalently attached
to substrates in a three-step ligation process in which the modifying
ubiquitin moiety is activated via high-energy thioesters, and then
joined to the substrate via an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal
carboxylic acid of ubiquitin and, in most cases,3 the epsilon-amino group of an accessible lysine residue
in the substrate. This process is catalyzed by a cascade of enzymes,
the E1, E2, E3, and sometimes E4 ligases. In addition to the substrate
protein, ubiquitin becomes ligated to itself through different primary
amino groups in ubiquitin, and this polyubiquitination process codes
the fate of the substrate proteins (e.g., degradation, membrane trafficking,
and various signaling processes). There are seven lysine residues
in ubiquitin in addition to its N-terminal primary amine for a total
of eight possible sites that can be ubiquitinated,4 and Xu and co-workers observed that all possible sites
of conjugation are employed in vivo in yeast.5

The ability to unravel the functional roles
of different polyubiquitination
patterns on proteins in vivo is impeded by the large
size of the modification and the lack of methods that can deduce linkage
composition of ubiquitin chains with or without an attached substrate.
SDS PAGE and Western blotting with linkage specific antibodies is
employed for in vitro studies, but the possibility
of mixed linkage chains confounds immunoblotting experiments, and
the mass resolution available from SDS PAGE is not high enough for
complex samples that could contain multiple substrates.

Mass
spectrometry (MS) is also used to determine lengths and linkage
patterns.6−11 The amino acid sequence of ubiquitin ends in Arg-Gly-Gly, and this
motif is recognized by trypsin. Hence, tryptic digestion of a ubiquitin-modified
protein results in peptides that maintain a characteristic diglycine
motif at the site of modification. The small size and specificity
of the diglycine tag (∼114 Da)6 allows
identification of the modified lysine residue using tandem mass spectrometry
(MS/MS), thus providing a means to identify the presence and location
of ubiquitin attachment to proteins. A similar approach using GluC
digestion results in longer tags and is applied less frequently.12 Past studies have shed new light on the specific
lysines involved in polyubiquitination;13,14 nevertheless
two key aspects of the process have proven more difficult to decipher.
First, the lengths of the polyubiquitin chains on a given substrate
remain undefined; second, the linkage patterns of the polyubiquitin
chains are usually uncharacterized.

Presented here is a method
that exploits the unprecedented level
of protein characterization attainable using top-down 193-nm ultraviolet
photodissociation (UVPD) mass spectrometry15,16 to confidently identify length and linkage types within polyubiquitin
chains. This method capitalizes on the fact that polyubiquitin chains
have multiple N-termini, which, upon fragmentation in a mass spectrometer,
create an excess of N-terminal ubiquitin fragment ion current. Different
ubiquitin linkages produce characteristic ion current patterns that
can be used to estimate linkage type and stoichiometry.

Materials and
Methods
Ubiquitin Purification
Ubiquitin was purified as previously
described.17 Briefly, ubiquitin was expressed
from a pET-3a plasmid in E. coli Rosetta(DE3)pLysS
(Rosetta) cells. Cultures were grown in 2× YT (microbial growth
medium) under ampicillin (amp) and chloramphenicol (cl) selection
at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.6 and induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl
β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4 h. Cells were
collected by centrifugation at 6000 g for 10 min, resuspended in 50
mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, and frozen at 80 °C. Cells were lysed by
the addition of 0.02% NP-40 (cell lysis buffer) and 0.4 mg/mL lysozyme
to the frozen cell pellet in the presence of Protease Inhibitor Cocktail
Set V, EDTA-Free (Calbiochem No. 539137). Cells were thawed in a room-temperature
water bath. To digest the DNA, 10 mM MgCl2 and 20 μg
mL–1 DNase I were added to the lysate and rocked
at room temperature for 10–20 min. Lysate was collected by
centrifugation at 8000 g for 20 min at 4 °C. To precipitate the
majority of proteins other than ubiquitin, 70% perchloric acid was
added slowly to a vigorously stirring supernatant on ice to a final
concentration of 0.5% (v/v), and stirring was continued for an additional
10 min. The treated lysate was centrifuged at 8000g for 20 min at 4 °C and the resulting supernatant dialyzed against
50 mM ammonium acetate pH 4.5 in 3.5 kDa molecular weight cutoff dialysis
tubing (Thermo Scientific No. 68035). The dialyzed material was filtered
through a 0.45-μm filter, loaded onto a 6-mL Resource S (GE
No. 17-1180-01) column, washed with 2 column volumes, and eluted with
a-20 column volume gradient of 0–500 mM NaCl in 50 mM ammonium
acetate pH 4.5, taking 2 mL fractions. The protein was then concentrated
and buffer exchanged in a 3 kDa molecular weight cutoff Amicon Ultra
(Millipore No. UFC900324) into 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6 to a final concentration
of 50–100 mg mL–1.

Ubiquitin Chain Synthesis
and Purification
Lys48 ubiquitin
chains were synthesized by treating 20 mg mL–1 ubiquitin
with 0.2 volume PBDM8 buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl pH8, 25 mM MgCl2, 50 mM creatine phosphate, 3 U/mL inorganic pyrophosphatase,
3 U/mL creatine phosphokinase), 2.5 mM ATP, 0.5 mM DTT, 20 μM
E2–25K, and 0.1 μM His6-Ube1 at 37 °C overnight.
The reaction was quenched with 5 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA for 20 min at
room temperature. To remove the enzymes, the reaction was run over
a 0.5 mL Q Sepharose FF column (GE No. 17-0510-10) equilibrated with
50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, and 5 mM DTT, and washed with four
column volumes of the same buffer. The flow-through and wash were
collected and acidified with 0.1 volume 2 N acetic acid to a pH of
∼4, loaded onto a 6-mL Resource S (GE No. 17-1180-01) column
equilibrated with 50 mM ammonium acetate (pH 4.5), washed with 2 column
volumes of 50 mM ammonium acetate, and eluted with a gradient of 1
column volume of 0–250 mM NaCl, 28 column volumes of 250–700
mM NaCl, and 1 column volume of 700–1000 mM NaCl in 50 mM ammonium
acetate (pH 4.5), taking 2-mL fractions. The fractions containing
Ub4(Lys48) were determined by SDS-Page analysis and concentrated in
a 3 kDa molecular weight cutoff Amicon Ultra (Millipore No. UFC900324),
and Ub4(Lys48) was separated on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 pg (GE
No. 28-9893-33) size exclusion column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl
pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, 150 mM NaCl, and the fractions containing
Ub4(Lys48) were pooled and concentrated.

Lys63 ubiquitin chains
were created using the same protocol as for Lys48 ubiquitin chains,
except that 2 μM Ubc13 and 2 μM Mms2 were used instead
of E2-25K, and PBDM7.6 (pH 7.6) was used instead of PBDM8 (pH 8.0).

Enzyme Purification
His6-Ube1 (Mus musculus) was purified as previously described.18 E2-25K (Homo sapiens), Ubc13 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), Mms2 (Saccharomyces
cerevisiae), Rsp5 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and UbcH7 (Homo sapiens) were purified
as GST-fusion proteins and the GST tag was removed by PreScission
Protease. GST-E2-25K was cloned from Addgene plasmid No. 18892,17 GST-Ubc13 was cloned from Addgene plasmid No.
18894,19 and GST-Mms2 was cloned from Addgene
plasmid No. 18893,19 each into a pGEX-6p-1.
(The GST-Rsp5 plasmid was a generous gift from Linda Hicke.)

GST-E2-25K and GST-UbcH7 were expressed in Rosetta cells in 2×
YT grown at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.6 and induced with 0.1 mM
IPTG for 4 h. GST-Ubc13 and GST-Mms2 were grown and purified as previously
described.20 Briefly, GST-Ubc13 and GST-Mms2
were expressed in Rosetta cells in LB grown at 37 °C to an OD600
of 0.6 and induced with 0.4 mM IPTG overnight at 25 °C. GST-Rsp5
was expressed in Rosetta cells in 2× YT + amp + cm grown at 37
°C to an OD600 of 0.2, the cells were then grown at 18 °C
to an OD600 of 0.4 and induced with 1 mM IPTG overnight at 18 °C.
All cells were collected by centrifugation at 6000 g for 10 min, resuspended
in PBS, and frozen at −80 °C.

For GST purification,
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set V, EDTA-Free
(Calbiochem No. 539137), 1% TritonX-100, 0.4 mg mL–1 lysozyme, 10 mM MgCl2, and 20 μg mL–1 DNase I were added to the frozen cell pellets and thawed in a room-temperature
water bath. DNA was digested by rocking at room temperature for 10–20
min. Cells were lysed by an EmulsiFlex-C3 (Avestin). To aid in GST
fusion protein solubility, the lysate was neutated for 30 min at 4
°C. The lysate was centrifuged twice at 14 000 g for 20
min, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and incubated with 2
mL of Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (GE No. 17-0756-01). The mixture
was poured into an empty PD-10 column (GE No. 17-0435-01), washed
3 times with 10 column volumes of PBS, and once with 10 column volumes
of PreScission cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT). To elute the protein, PreScission protease
in a PreScission cleavage buffer was flowed into the column and incubated
with the beads overnight at 4 °C. The cleaved protein was removed
with 3 column volumes of PreScission cleavage buffer and concentrated
(if necessary). Glycerol was added (5%–10% v/v), and the eluted
protein was aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored
at −80 °C.

Ubiquitination of Sic60-DHFR-His6 Substrate
Sic60-DHFR-His6
was expressed in Rosetta cells in 2× YT + amp + cm at 37 °C
to an OD600 of 0.6 and induced with 0.4 mM IPTG for 4 h. Cells were
collected by centrifugation at 6000g for 10 min,
resuspended in NPI-10 (50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, and 10
mM imidazole pH 8.0), and frozen at −80 °C. For purification,
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set V, EDTA-Free (Calbiochem No. 539137),
1 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl2, and 20 μg mL–1 DNase I were added to the frozen cells, and the pellets thawed in
a room temperature water bath. To digest the DNA, cells were rocked
at room temperature for 10–20 min. The cells were lysed by
an EmulsiFlex-C3 (Avestin), centrifuged twice at 14 000 g for
20 min, and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. The clarified
lysate was applied to a 5-mL HisTrap FF Crude column (GE No. 17-5286-01),
washed with 2 column volumes of NPI-10, washed with 10 column volumes
of 4.2% NPI-250 (NPI-10 with 250 mM imidazole) in NPI-10, and then
eluted with 10 column volumes of NPI-250 into 2-mL fractions. The
fractions containing the protein were combined and concentrated to
1 mL in an Amicon Ultra with a molecular weight cutoff of 10 kDa.
The protein was separated on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 pg (GE No.
28-9893-33) size exclusion column at 0.5 mL min–1. The fractions containing the Sic60-DHFR-His6 were combined, concentrated,
and desalted into 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6 in 1 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA.

The ubiquitination procedure was modified from the method of Kraut
et al.21 The protein was ubiquitinated
for 1 h at 25 °C in 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 0.25 μM His6-Ube1, 2.5 μM UbcH7, 3.25 μM
Ubiquitin, 4 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, and 1.5 μM Rsp5. The reaction
was diluted into 5 mL of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 5 mM DTT, and 1 mM
EDTA and loaded onto a MonoQ column (GE No. 17-5166-01) equilibrated
with the same buffer. The protein was then eluted with a linear gradient
of 0–500 mM NaCl in the same buffer over 30 column volumes,
taking 1-mL fractions. The fractions containing the Ub3(Lys63)-Sic60-DHFR-His6
were pooled, concentrated to 500 μL in an Amicon Ultra with
a molecular weight cutoff of 10 kDa, and separated on a HiLoad 16/600
Superdex 75 pg (GE No. 28-9893-33) size exclusion column equilibrated
with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 300 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA
at 0.3 mL min–1 into 2-mL fractions.

Top-Down Ultraviolet
Photodissociation (UVPD) Mass Spectrometry
Protein concentrations
were based on the theoretical molar absorptivity
of yeast ubiquitin. All ubiquitin chains and the ubiquitinated Sic60-DHFR
fusion were buffer-exchanged three times into LC-MS grade water and
diluted to a final concentration of 20 μM in a 50/49/1 (v/v/v)
mixture of acetonitrile/water/formic acid. Dimeric recombinant human
Lys48 and Lys63 chains were purchased from Boston Biochem (Boston,
MA) and resuspended in the infusion solution directly, without further
purification. All protein solutions were infused at a rate of 3 μL
min–1 directly into an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA) that was modified to accommodate an
ArF 193-nm excimer laser (Coherent Existar XS), as previously described.22 All spectra were acquired at a resolving power
of 240 000× and were an average of 500 total scans. Spectra
were deconvoluted using the Xtract algorithm (Thermo Fisher) with
a signal-to-noise ratio of 5:1. Spectra were interpreted manually
and, using a version of ProSightPC 3.0, modified to accommodate the
ion types associated with UVPD.15 Ions
were matched against all predicted a-, b-, and c-type ions. Detection of solely N-terminally
derived ions was based on the assumption that each constituent monomer
in the chain is equally likely to fragment upon irradiation. Ion abundances
of N-terminal ions for the stoichiometric comparison of Lys48- and
Lys63-linked chains in known ratios were derived from the ions matched
by ProSightPC 3.0.

Results and Discussion
This analysis
is facilitated by the conjugation of each ubiquitin’s
C-terminus to the substrate or to another ubiquitin molecule. In the
case of a polyubiquitin chain, this means that fragmentation along
any ubiquitin monomer in the chain results in conventional N-terminal
ubiquitin fragments, as well as complementary C-terminal product ions
that are appended to the remainder of the protein. For larger polyubiquinated
proteins, the greater sizes of the C-terminal ions result in broader
isotopic profiles, lower average ion current, and significant m/z overlap, diminishing their detection
and simplifying interpretation of the resulting MS/MS spectra. In
all cases, measurement of the length of the ubiquitin chains stems
from the MS1 spectrum (i.e., the mass measurement of the intact ubiquitinated
protein). The intact mass unambiguously defines the length of the
polyubiquitin moiety, and this is regardless of linkage type. Indeed,
all possible linkage combinations of the same length will have the
same intact mass. While the different linkage types will undoubtedly
have different three-dimensional (3D) structures, this has no effect
on intact mass, since all polyubiquitin chains of equal length have
identical empirical formulas. For example, Lys63 ubiquitin chains
have a more-linear configuration, whereas Lys48 chains have a more
“closed” configuration, so these two different chain
types span a range of potential topologies. However, the proteins
are analyzed under denaturing ESI conditions, not native ESI conditions,
and topologies of proteins under denaturing conditions have not been
found to significantly influence the resulting MS/MS fragmentation
patterns.

Upon UVPD, the resulting MS/MS spectra are thus composed
of predominantly
N-terminal ions that are representative of the linkages. The N-termini
of ubiquitin moieties in different polyubiquitin chains are identical
up to the first Lys residue whose epsilon amino group is modified
by forming the pseudo-peptide (isopeptide) bond with the C-terminus
of the next ubiquitin moiety in the chain. Cleavage of the polypeptide
backbone in these N-terminal regions during fragmentation creates
identical ions from each ubiquitin in the chain that collectively
increase the ion current for the fragments shared by each monomer.
Once the modified Lys is reached, the mass of the fragments increases
(by at least the mass of an entire ubiquitin moiety), removing its
contribution to the N-terminal fragments shared by each monomer. In
addition, different branching patterns in the polyubiquitin chain
result in distinct characteristic ion current patterns that can, in
principle, be assigned unambiguously (see Figure 1).

Figure 1 Schematic representations of a (A) homogeneously Lys48-linked and
(B) a mixed linkage tetraubiquitin chain composed of three Lys48 linkages
and one Lys63 linkage. N-termini are labeled, and C-termini are depicted
with dark blue circles. Shown on the lower portion of panels (A) and
(B) are the corresponding theoretical UVPD mass spectra depicting
the N-terminally derived ions from the ubiquitin chains. The green-shaded
peaks in the spectra highlight regions of the protein that result
in isobaric N-terminal fragment ions from each monomeric Ub unit.
In panel (B), the N-terminal ions that are specific to the Lys63 linkage
portion are shown in yellow, and the ions derived from the most distal
ubiquitin in the chain, which extend all the way to the C-terminus
(the a75 ion), are shown in blue.

In practice, this strategy is
dependent on the creation of ions
representing every (or almost every) inter-residue position from the
N-terminus of ubiquitin to the position preceding the Lys residue
at the branch point to ensure that linkage types can be confidently
differentiated from each other. In contrast to other methods, UVPD
results in a reproducible and almost-complete series of N-terminal
ions for most intact proteins.23,24 Indeed, previous work
from this laboratory15 demonstrated that
UVPD of monoubiquitin resulted in cleavage at every inter-residue
position (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), providing 100% product ion sequence coverage. This level of characterization
is crucial for defining the linkage type in ubiquitin chains. Fragmentation
between every residue allows one to resolve the site of conjugation
to a single-candidate Lys residue. Of the seven available Lys residues
on ubiquitin, the results from the present study indicate (via observation
of an almost-complete sequence of a-type ions) that
top-down UVPD is capable of characterizing the ubiquitination of five
of them. The characterization of two other linkage sites (Lys6 and
Lys11) is not expected to be feasible due to the m/z overlap of the diagnostic ions arising from these
linkages with the multiply charged artifacts left over following deconvolution.
This study serves as a proof of concept and focus on the two most
common linkage types: Lys48 and Lys63.

To test whether the hypothetical
spectra depicted in Figure 1 can, in fact,
be produced by UVPD of polyubiquitin
chains, Lys63 and Lys48 dimers, tetramers, and longer multimers were
analyzed using UVPD. Examples of the resulting UVPD mass spectra are
shown in Figure 2, and charge-deconvoluted,
monoisotopic UVPD mass spectra are shown in Figure 3 for Lys48- and Lys63-linked tetraubiquitin to illustrate
the striking array of a-type ions. As observed in
Figure 3, the contiguous series of a-type ions is easily assigned, with the series terminating
at a47 for the Lys48-linked tetraubiquitin
(Figure 3A), relative to the longer series
of a-type ions for the Lys63-linked tetramer (Figure 3B). Complementary C-terminal x-type
ions are not identified, which represents an outcome attributed to
their much larger sizes and higher charge states than the a-type ions. These features (large sizes and high charge
states of the C-terminal ions) result in each fragment ion being distributed
among a greater array of isotopes (i.e., low S/N) and with substantial m/z overlap (i.e., difficult to resolve),
ultimately obscuring their assignment. Potential secondary dissociation
of these large ions (and formation of unassignable internal ions)
may also contribute to their absence.

Figure 2 Charge-deconvoluted UVPD product ion spectra
of (A) Lys48-linked
diubiquitin (10+) and (B) Lys63-linked diubiquitin (10+). The schematic
depictions to the right show diubiquitin linked through either Lys48
or Lys63, and the green arrows indicate the regions that would yield
N-terminal ion produced by cleavage between Lys 48 and Lys63. The
portion of the UVPD mass spectrum shaded in green represents ions
formed by backbone cleavage between the N-terminus and Lys48, and
the portion of the UVPD mass spectrum shaded in gold represents ions
produced by cleavage occurring between Lys48 and Lys63. The significant
decrease in abundance of N-terminal fragments ions beyond a47 in panel (A), relative to panel (B), indicates
that the larger an fragment
ions evolve from only one of the two ubiquitin chains in the diubiquitin
in panel (A). Also shown are UVPD spectra of Lys48 linked to Ubi2 (10+) (panel (C)), Ubi4 (20+) (panel (D)), Ubi5 (30+) (panel (E)), and a mixture of Ubi7 and Ubi8 (multiple charge states) (panel (F)). The regions shaded
in green represent the array of all fragment ions up to the a47 ion. For each spectrum, the purified ubiquitin
chains were infused and activated via a single 5-ns laser pulse.

Figure 3 Representative charge deconvoluted, monoisotopic
UVPD mass spectra
of (A) Lys48- and (B) Lys63-linked tetraubiquitin (24+), obtained
using 1 laser pulse (at 1 mJ per pulse). Ladder-type sequencing up
to the isopeptide bond provides evidence for linkage type determination.

The Lys63 and Lys48 dimers resulted
in N-terminal ion series clearly
indicative of their respective linkage types (Figures 2A and 2B). The green shaded regions
in Figures 2A and 2B
represent all fragment ions from the N-terminus through the a47 ion (the longest possible N-terminal ion
before Lys 48); the yellow shaded region represents fragment ions
from a48 to a62 for two diubiquitin species. In the case of Lys48-linked ubiquitin
(Figure 2A), the total fragment ion current
in the diagnostic region decreased dramatically after the a47 ion, as expected for species with isopeptide
bonds at the 48th residue. For the Lys63-linked dimer (Figure 2B), the ion current decreased after the a62 ion. The pattern becomes even more pronounced
for longer homogeneously linked ubiquitin chains (see Figures 2C–F), and the change in ion current from
regions in the protein that are specifically indicative of the sites
of conjugation can be used in a semiquantitative manner (see discussion
below).

The correlation between the N-terminal product ion current
and
the number of constituent monomers contributing to that ion current
can be exploited to characterize the linkages quantitatively after
empirical calibration. To test the feasibility of top-down UVPD-MS
for determining linkage stoichiometry, homogeneously linked Lys48
and Lys63 ubiquitin tetramers were purified and mixed in known molar
ratios. While these are not actual mixed-linkage polyubiquitins, the
fragmentation patterns obtained for samples containing both tetramers
would reflect the stoichiometry of fragment ions that are uniquely
representative of each linkage type. The method requires that the
two oligomers have similar ionization efficiencies, and analysis of
the homogeneously linked tetraubiquitin chains showed that this is
indeed the case (see Figure S2 in the Supporting
Information). The two tetrameric chains were then mixed in
different molar ratios and analyzed via UVPD-MS (see Figure 4). The ion current of the N-terminal fragments is
easily detected and the total product ion current decreased for the
ions specific to the Lys63 linkage type (ions a48–a62), relative to the
much greater ion current attributed to Lys48 (and common Lys63) fragment
ions as the ratio of Lys48 to Lys63 linkages increased in the sample.
The UVPD mass spectra in Figure 4A show the
gradual change in abundance of the ions that are uniquely derived
from the Lys63 tetramer (a48–a62), relative to the higher abundance fragments
that are derived from both tetramers (a1–a47). Even for the equimolar
Lys48:Lys63 samples, there is an intrinsic excess of ions, prior to
Lys48, because these ions are produced from both tetramers, while
the N-terminal ions representative of residues 48–62 are unique
to the Lys63 tetramer. This phenomenon is depicted in the theoretical
spectrum shown in Figure 1B (where yellow lines
indicate the contribution from Lys63 linkage-containing monomer fragments
to those attributed to the Lys48-derived fragments). To accommodate
this overlap, the average abundance of all N-terminally derived ions
present between Lys48 and Lys63 must be subtracted from the average
abundance of N-terminally derived ions up until Lys48, as shown below:  where ((∑i1–47)/47) is the average intensity of all ions from a1 to a47, and ((∑i48–62)/15) is the average intensity of
all ions from a48 to a62 (and the denominator 15 or 47 represents the number
of residues corresponding to the different linkage positions). This
treatment accounts for the contribution of fragment ions derived from
the Lys63 tetramer to the ion current shared by both species and is
readily adapted for other polyubiquitin linkages. Plotting the derived
linkage ratios against their expected ratios results in a linear relationship
that provides an estimate of the ratio of one linkage type to the
other (Figure 4B). (Refer to Tables S1–S5 in the Supporting Information for the
tabulations of mass assignments of fragment ions and abundances used
for the calculations.)

chains) and infused into the mass spectrometer. The z = 25 charge state was isolated (containing both Lys48 and Lys63
tetraubiquitin populations) and subjected to UVPD (one pulse, 1.5
mJ). Ions attributed to the Lys48 linkage are shaded in green and
ions attributed to the Lys63 linkage are shaded in yellow. (B) Graphical

A final test for the method used
an in vitro-formulated
substrate, a fusion construct of amino acids 1 to 60 of yeast Sic1
protein, modified by the addition of a PY motif to accept ubiquitination
by Rsp5,25 followed by E.
coli dihydrofolate reductase and then a hexahistidine
tag. The total mass of the fusion protein prior to ubiquitination
is ∼24.9 kDa. Ubiquitin moieties were then ligated to amino
acid 38 of the substrate via the HECT E3 ligase Rsp5.26 Intact mass spectra revealed that several species were
produced, including diubiquitinated (for a total mass of ∼43
kDa) and triubiquitinated species (for a total mass of ∼52
kDa), and these were observed both in their N-terminally acetylated
and nonacetylated forms, as is common for proteins expressed in E. coli (see Figure 5). Top-down
UVPD-MS of ubiquitin chains attached to nonubiquitin substrates provides
the opportunity for discriminating the substrate from the polyubiquitin
chain based on ion type alone, because ubiquitin-derived fragment
ions will match only predicted N- terminal ions (a-, b-, and c-type ions) in the
sequence, but fragment ions derived from the substrate can be matched
to predicted sequence ions from either terminus (a-, b-, c-, x-, y-, and z-type ions). Since ubiquitin is
ligated to the protein via its C-terminus, there will be no C-terminally
derived ions produced from a ubiquitin moiety ligated to the substrate.
This allows the set of observed fragment ions from a given spectrum
to be searched against specific predicted ion types from candidate
protein sequences that will be uniquely attributed to either the substrate
or the modifying ubiquitin moiety. Ideally, a two-step search method
will be exploited in which only C-terminally derived ions are detected
to identify the substrate, and only N-terminally derived ions from
ubiquitin are used to deduce linkage type. First, UVPD mass spectra
derived from monoubiquitin and the unmodified Sic60-DHFR construct
were compared to confirm that there was no significant fragment ion
overlap that would prevent assignment of diagnostic fragment ions
and that could not be overcome by the high mass accuracy used in this
study (see Figure 6). Figure 6 shows a representative deconvoluted section from 5000 Da
to 6000 Da, and the spectra are summarized in Tables S8 and S9 in the Supporting Information. The top-down
MS/MS spectra for intact proteins are congested and require high-mass-accuracy
capabilities to assign the fragment ions; however, this can be readily
done using an Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Two isotopic envelopes are
expanded in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information, showing the region of the a50 ion for
monoubiquitin (10+ precursor) and the Y47/y47 region for Sic60-DHFR (23+ precursor).
The mass difference between these two is readily differentiated in
the high-resolution/high-accuracy mass spectrum. Overall, there appears
to be no ambiguity in assignment of ubiquitin-related fragment ions
and fragment ions from the substrate protein. Next, the bioinformatic
approach outlined above was applied to the Sic60-DHFR-Ubn construct, following infusion of the pure protein
and UVPD-MS analysis, and revealed high ion current from N-terminally
derived ions matched to the ubiquitin primary sequence up to the a62 ion (see Table S6 in
the Supporting Information). Within the same spectrum, C-terminally
derived ions were matched to the Sic60-DHFR construct well into the
interior of the protein’s primary sequence (up until the Y134 ion (see Table S7 in
the Supporting Information)). Comparison of the average ion
current derived from ions that preceded the isopeptide bond at Lys63
to those that came after it (from a63 up
to the a75 ion) revealed a 3.4:1 excess
of the Lys63-specific region over the ions representative of the most
distal ubiquitin (from a63 up to the a75 ion). This ratio, taken together with the
chain length deduced from the intact mass measurement (i.e., corresponding
to the net mass of three attached ubiquitins; Figure 5), shows that the modifying ubiquitin moieties were linked
via Lys63. The same approach was used to compare the ion current of
the regions specific to the Lys48 linkage to that of those ions specific
for Lys63. After applying the proposed spectral subtraction, the Lys48:Lys63
ratio was empirically derived to be 1.5:1 (see Table S6 in the Supporting Information), which is consistent
with the slight fragmentation bias for detection of the Lys48-specific
fragments observed in the diubiquitin and tetraubiquitin studies (Figures 2B and 4). Using these data
in conjunction with the intact mass of the precursor and high observed
ion current up to and including the a62 ion, there was ample evidence to confirm that this substrate was
homogeneously linked via Lys63 linkages and contains three ubiquitins.

fusion proteins. An asterisk highlights the z = 42
charge state, which was isolated for UVPD MS/MS. (B) Deconvoluted
mass spectrum from panel (A). The mass of the expected translated
sequence was observed (middle peak in each spectrum), as well as an
acetylated version. The double dagger symbol (‡)
denotes an alternative form of the fusion protein in which the first
two N-terminal residues were removed. Shown in the right section are
the corresponding species that have three, rather than two, ubiquitins
attached.

Figure 6 Shown are expanded regions of charge-deconvoluted
UVPD mass spectra
of (A) monoubiquitin (based on UVPD of the 10+ precursor) and (B)
unmodified Sic60-DHFR (based on UVPD of the 23+ precursor) demonstrating
little ion overlap. Panels (C) and (D) show comparisons of the expanded
isotopic envelopes of the a47 ion from
monoubiquitin and the combination of the Y47 and y47 ions from Sic60-DHFR (expanded
peaks are shaded in gray in panels (A) and (B)). The majority of matched
ions were matched at <2 ppm and none were matched at >10 ppm.
For
reference, the mass difference shown between two adjacent peaks in
panels (C) and (D) is >50 ppm, thus confirming the ability to readily
differentiate ubiquitin-derived and DHFR-derived ions.

The present method was demonstrated on relatively
concentrated
(20 μM) ubiquitin samples to demonstrate feasibility; however,
in practice, the sensitivity is identical to that of any top-down
experiment. Top-down UVPD-MS has been previously demonstrated in an
online chromatographic workflow.23 In the
earlier study, as little as 3.8 pmol of ribosomal proteins (on the
order of 0.1 ug total protein) were loaded on column and analyzed.
Top-down methods have not yet routinely achieved the sensitivity and
detection limits of bottom-up methods. However, the superior capabilities
of top-down MS/MS methods for characterization of proteoforms of proteins
make it well-suited for the type of application reported in the present
study.

Conclusions
The method outlined above demonstrates
the power of top-down UVPD-MS
for determining the size and linkage type of polyubiquitin chains.
Although the order of connectivity remains undefined, the potential
for relative stoichiometry determination based on ion current measurements
within a mixture of multiple chain types provides an unprecedented
level of characterization from a single experiment. This arises from
the systematic change in ion current associated with N-terminally
derived ions that precede or follow the site of isopeptide conjugation.
This method capitalizes on both the critically important intact mass
measurement of top-down MS to describe chain length and the almost-complete
backbone fragmentation provided by N-terminally derived ions after
UVPD to detect the ubiquitin linkage pattern, especially for homogeneously
linked chains. To further advance this strategy, additional effort
will be directed at making it quantitative, as well as implementing
it in a chromatographic workflow to dissect mixtures of ubiquinated
substrates. Moreover, heterogeneous sets of conjugates of the same
size are currently intractable, and protein-level online separation
methods do not offer sufficient resolution to resolve them at this
point.
