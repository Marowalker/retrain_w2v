A straightforward,
direct, and selective method is presented for
electrochemical cocaine identification in street samples. The sensing
mechanism is based on a simple ion transfer reaction across the polarized
liquid–liquid interface. The interfacial behavior of a number
of cutting agents is also reported. Interfacial miniaturization has
led to improved electroanalytical properties of the liquid–liquid
interface based sensor as compared with the macroscopic analogue.
The reported method holds great potential to replace colorimetric
tests with poor selectivity for on-site street sample analysis.

==== Body
After cannabis,
cocaine is one
of the most used illicit drugs in Europe and the US.1,2 Around 17 million people worldwide are estimated to be cocaine users.3 As an addictive drug, it leads to a number of
harmful direct (psychological and physiological disorders) and indirect
(hepatitis C or/and HIV infections) effects. Increasing worldwide
cocaine production3 together with elaborated
trafficking techniques do not facilitate the work of responsible officers
from police, custom borders, or forensic institutes. The need for
portable, small, easy in operation, sensitive, and selective sensors
able to measure a wide range of cocaine concentrations is therefore
high. In other words, there is a gap between the primitive colorimetric
tests (e.g., Scott test)4 and sophisticated
techniques requiring costly instrumentation (e.g., chromatography
and mass spectrometry). The vast amount of effort related to cocaine
detection is based on different aptamer-based configurations.5 In general, the specific cocaine binding to an
appropriately engineered aptamer chain leads to conformational changes
that can be detected with fluorescence triggering6 or quenching,7,8 simple solution color
change utilizing metallic nanoparticles9,10 or dyes entrapped
in the folded aptamer structure,11 change
in the resonance frequency of the quartz crystal modified with the
aptamer reach affinity layer,12,13 or drop in ionic currents
flowing through the nanopore (membrane protein channel – α-hemolysin)
embedded in the free-standing lipid bilayer.14,15 A lot of attention was devoted to electrochemical sensors modified
with the cocaine-specific aptamer. Three main signal transduction
mechanisms can be distinguished: (i) increasing charge transfer resistance
after cocaine binding and aptamer folding,16−18 (ii) bringing
the redox probe modified aptamer close to the electrode surface upon
cocaine binding,19−21 or (iii) the redox-recycling mechanism where the
redox mediator can shuttle electrons from the electrode surface to
the appropriately modified aptamer.22,23 All these
examples are rather complex, require multiple, mutually interacting
components, and rely on aptamer selectivity. Direct electrochemical
oxidation of cocaine tertiary amine functionality at carbon-based
electrodes24,25 provides a simple option for
cocaine detection. Recently, De Jong et al. reported a very elegant
method for direct cocaine discrimination from street samples used
on a glove printed carbon electrode.26

Electrochemistry at the liquid–liquid interface (also known
as an interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions - ITIES)
allows for the unconventional detection of analytes where the signal
originates from interfacial ion transfer reaction rather than oxidation/reduction.27 The selectivity of the bare (unmodified) liquid–liquid
interface is purely governed by ionic partitioning.28−30 Additional
selectivity can be induced via incorporation of ionophores31,32 into one of the immiscible phases or interfacial decoration with
a charge or size selective membrane.33,34 Illicit drug
sensing at the ITIES is limited to a recent report concerning gamma-aminobutyric acid detection at the nanopipette-ITIES35 and pharmacokinetic studies devoted to a few
opioids and amphetamine-like drugs.36 Alternative
detection of cocaine at a soft junction was reported by Wägli
et al., where its paritioning from the aqueous phase to the tetrachloroethylene
droplets formed in the microfludic devices was continuously monitored
by IR spectrsocopy.37

Adulterants
or cutting agents added purposely to cocaine powders
aim only to increase profits by lowering the amount of cocaine in
the samples or to mislead authorities when these are subjected to
chemical analysis. These cutting agents include substances like sugars
(glucose, maltose, lactose, etc.), boric acid, sodium bicarbonate,
or nonillicit drugs among others.38 For
the latter, the most frequently found cocaine street samples adulterating
agents are caffeine, phenacetin, lidocaine, or paracetamol.38 Consequently, in this work, we focused our attention
on electrochemical detection of cocaine and its frequently used cutting
agents at the electrified liquid–liquid interface. With ion
transfer voltammetry we investigated the effect of cocaine concentration,
the pH of the aqueous phase, and the dimensions of the electroactive
interface area on cocaine ion transfer behavior. Lastly, the validity
of the proposed technique was confirmed on confiscated street samples.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
Potassium tetrakis(4-chlorophenyl)borate
(KTPBCl, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) and bis(triphenylphosphoranylidene)ammonium
chloride (BTPPACl, Sigma-Aldrich, 97%) were used to prepare the organic
phase electrolyte bis(triphenylphosphoranylidene)ammonium tetrakis(4-chlorophenyl)borate
(BTPPATPBCl) via a simple metathesis reaction according to the protocol
published elsewhere.39 The organic phase
was 1,2-dichloroethane (>99.5%) from Sigma-Aldrich. The aqueous
phase
electrolyte was 10 mM HCl prepared using 1 M HCl volumetric solutions
from Merck. Studied drugs: tetramethylammonium chloride (TMACl, 97%),
cocaine hydrochloride (analytical standard), procaine hydrochloride
(≥97%), acetylsalicylic acid (≥99%), hydroxyzine dihydrochloride
(≥98%), levamisole hydrochloride (analytical standard), diphenhydramine
hydrochloride (≥98%), lidocaine, benzocaine, phenacetin (≥98%),
prilocaine hydrochloride (≥98%), caffeine, diltiazem hydrochloride,
boric acid (99.9%), and glucose (>99.5%) were all from Sigma-Aldrich.
Buffers were prepared using citric acid (>99%) from VWR chemicals
and sodium dihydrogen phosphate (>99%) from Fluka. The pH of the
aqueous
phase was adjusted with 1 M NaOH (volumetric solution from Fluka)
or 1 M HCl. Ag/AgCl reference electrodes were made via anodic silver
oxidation in a 1 M HCl solution. Dissolution of gold wire was performed
in the mixture of nitric acid (>65.5%) and hydrochloric acid (37%)
at 3:1 (v:v) ratio, both from Sigma-Aldrich.

Electrochemical Experiments
Electrochemical measurements
were performed using an Autolab PGSTAT302N or EmStat blue equipped
with differential electrometer amplifier from PalmSens. The experiments
at the macroITIES were performed in a classical four electrode electrochemical
cell.40 Each phase contained one platinum
counter electrode and one Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The organic
phase counter electrode was additionally covered with glass in order
to prevent the contact with the aqueous phase. MicroITIES was prepared
according to the protocol described in the Supporting Information. Briefly, the microwires having a diameter of 25
μm were first sealed in a glass tube. Excess of glass was then
removed by polishing, followed by wire dissolution in aqua
regia. The remaining micropore was used to support the liquid–liquid
interface.41 The electrochemical setup
used to polarize microITIES consisted of a silver wire (being both
the organic phase counter and the reference electrode) immersed directly
into the organic phase present inside the capillary.42 Platinum electrode and Ag/AgCl served as the counter and
reference electrodes in the aqueous phase. Cell I and Cell II represent
the composition of the electrochemical cells at the macro- and microITIES
respectively:

Wherever Δorgaqϕ is used as a label
of the x axis of the recoded voltammograms, the potential
of ion transfer is given as the standard Galvani potential difference
calibrated using an internal reference TMA+ with the ΔorgaqΦTMA+0 = 160 mV.43

Imaging
Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of
the microcapillaries were acquired with a JEOL JSM 6010LA microscope.
Optical images were acquired using a conventional optical microscope
equipped with a CCD camera.

Results and Discussion
At pH = 2, cocaine owning tertiary amine functionality with a pKa = 8.7044 is protonated and, hence, positively charged. As deduced
from the ion transfer voltammogram in Figure 1 cocaine undergoes reversible ion transfer
reaction with the forward and reversed peak current intensities ratio
≈ 1. Peak to peak separation >59/z mV is common at the electrified
liquid–liquid macrointerface and originates from the uncompensated
resistance of the organic phase.45,46 The ΔorgaqΦ1/2 for cocaine equals −76
mV and suggests rather hydrophobic character of the molecule. Interfacial
behavior of a number of cutting agents was investigated. Some of the
commonly used adulterants like sugars, boric acid, and drugs with
no ionizable or neutral (e.g., protonated carboxylic group) functionalities
do not give a signal as shown in Figure S2. Drugs that were found to undergo electrochemically controlled interfacial
ion transfer include diltiazem, hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine, levamisole,
lidocaine, procaine, and prilocaine. For caffeine and benzocaine,
ionic currents were overlaid with the background electrolyte ion transfer
(Haq↔org+) and were located
>400 mV toward more positive potential values as compared to the
transfer
potential of cocaine. Especially worth attention is lidocaine, being
false positive in colorimetric Scott tests,47 with ΔorgaqΦ1/2 = 115
mV being far enough from the cocaine transfer potential.

correspond to (1) 90.4 μM TMA+, (2) 100.7 μM
cocaine, (3) 52.6 μM diltiazem, (4) 85.5 μM hydroxyzine,
(5) 56.8 μM diphenhydramine, (6) 144.8 μM levamisole,
(7) 151.2 μM lidocaine, (8) 182.5 μM procaine, (9) 
116.4 μM prilocaine, (10) 516.5 μM caffeine, (11) 143.3
μM benzocaine, and (12) correspond to blank voltammogram. All
voltammograms were recorded at 10 mV/s with the aqueous phase being
10 mM HCl (pH = 2). Voltammograms for caffeine and benzocaine are
given after blank subtraction.

The ΔorgaqΦ1/2 of
levamisole (ΔorgaqΦ1/2 = 7 mV), procaine (ΔorgaqΦ1/2 = 121 mV), and prilocaine (ΔorgaqΦ1/2 = 195 mV) are also located on a more positive side of the potential
window. Three drug molecules that give a signal at a potential similar
to cocaine values are diltiazem (ΔorgaqΦ1/2 = −105 mV), hydroxyzine (ΔorgaqΦ1/2 = −84 mV), and diphenylhydramine
(ΔorgaqΦ1/2 = −54
mV). To further increase the voltammetric separation of the recorded
signals, the partitioning of these drugs can be affected by replacing
the organic solvent, offering a wider potential window (e.g., 1,2-dichlorobenzene,48 trifluorotoluene,49 or ionic liquids50). The interfacial
potentials at which drug species are partitioning to the contacted
phase can also be affected by acid–base equilibria. The change
in the ΔorgaqΦ1/2 for
cocaine recorded at different pH values (see Figure 2 and Figure S3 for ion transfer voltammograms) can be explained assuming that both
the protonated (CH+) and nonprotonated (C) cocaine species
can partition across the liquid–liquid interface. Neglecting
ion pair formation together with the assumption about the equality
of cocaine diffusion coefficients in the aqueous and the organic phase,
the pH dependent ΔorgaqΦ1/2 can be described using the following equation:51,52

variable in eq 1) of
the neutral form of cocaine (C) between the aqueous and the organic
phase:

 2  where CCaq and CCorg are
the concentrations
of the neutral cocaine form in the aqueous and the organic phase,
respectively. The best fit for the experimental values from Figure 2 was obtained for KD ≈ 3.5.

Direct
information about the mechanism of the interfacial charge
transfer reaction can be deduced from the ionic partition diagrams
and voltammograms.53 At low pH values,
and ΔorgaqΦ < ΔorgaqΦ°, the protonated CHaq+ form resides in the aqueous phase and can undergo simple
ion transfer reaction when the ΔorgaqΦ
is swept toward more positive values. At pH equal to around 5.1, the
concentration of [CHaq+] = [Corg], as deprotonated cocaine, can undergo
spontaneous partitioning to the organic phase. The presence of the
neutral form of cocaine in the organic phase facilitates the transfer
of a proton from the aqueous phase which is recorded as the Faradaic
current on the forward scan.

To further improve the electroanalytical
performance of the ITIES
based cocaine sensor, we performed miniaturization of the interface.
This was achieved straightforwardly via a metal wire templated method.50,54Figure 3A shows the
SEM micrograph of 25 μm gold wire embedded in a glass insulator
that was further dissolved in aqua regia to obtain
a microhole, which is clearly visible in Figure 3B. The protocol of microcapillary preparation
is described in the Supporting Information. Interfacial miniaturization brings a number of benefits: (i) ITIES
supported within micro- or nanopores gains mechanical stability; (ii)
the small dimensions of the system allow for very low chemicals consumption;
(iii) miniaturization facilitates interface modification;42,33 (iv) small iR drop permits the measurements in
low conductivity media, (v) lower surface area decreases the capacitive
current contribution, consequently lowering the limits of detection
(LOD),55 and finally, (vi) the transfer
of analyte toward the interface (in our case) from the aqueous side
of the liquid–liquid interface is governed by nondiffiusion
limited mass transfer only, which improves the overall sensitivity
of a sensing platform.55 The microITIES
prepared in our work has thick glass capillary walls meaning that
pseudohemispherical diffusion regimes will be established on the aqueous
side of the ITIES (see scheme in Figure 3D).

of the hemispherical and linear diffusion regimes, respectively.

On the other hand, the mass transfer
within the confined space
of the capillary (Figure 3E) is governed by the semi-infinitive linear-diffusion.56 Asymmetric properties of the microITIES are
out-printed by unique voltammograms as shown in Figure 3C, where the forward scan (TMAaq→org+) is represented by a steady-state
wave characteristic for the nondiffusion limited process and the backward
scan (TMAorg→aq+) gives
a well-defined peak governed by diffusion limited mass transfer. The
observed steady-state current can be described with56

 3  where Di is the aqueous
phase diffusion coefficient of the transferring
species, Ci is the aqueous
phase bulk concentration, F is the Faraday constant, z is the ionic charge, and r is the radius
of a microITIES. The steady-state current of a forward TMAaq→org+ transfer taken from Figure 3C, 0.46 nA, its diffusion coefficient
equal to 13.8 × 10–6 cm–2·s,57 and corresponding [TMA+] = 70.6 μM were substituted to eq 3 that gave ITIES diameter
equal to 24.5 μm (diameters measured with SEM oscilated from
24 to 26 μm). Such a simple scrutiny indicates that the liquid–liquid
interface is formed on the pore ingress only and thin organic film
formation on the bottom of the capillary can be excluded. Voltammetric
detection of cocaine at the macro- and microITIES can be found in Figure S5 and Figure S6, respectively. Electroanalytical characteristics of cocaine at ITIES
are summarized in Table 1. The presented method allows for cocaine detection in a wide range
of concentrations, starting from 20 μM up to < hundreds of
mM. As expected we found that after miniaturization (i) the voltammetric
sensitivity increased a few orders of magnitude and (ii) the calculated
limit of detection (LOD) dropped from 30.1 μM for macoITIES
down to 10.9 μM after interfacial downscaling. The obtained
limits of detection are comparable with those reported for cocaine
oxidation at nonmodified carbon based solid electrodes.58 LOD’s from this work are also within
concentration cutoff’s of the colorimetric tests59 and at the same time offer significantly higher
accuracy. The diffusion coefficient for the cocaine in the aqueous
phase was found to be 2.4 × 10–6 cm2 s–1, which agrees well with the value reported
elsewhere 2.7 × 10–6 cm2 s–1.60

To confirm the validity of our method we have randomly
chosen four
street samples (SS) and analyzed them at the macroITIES as shown in Figure 4. Prior to the analysis,
each SS was dissolved in 10 mM HCl being aqueous phase. Out of four
samples investigated only SS04 dissolved entirely. Samples SS01–SS03
were only partially soluble despite sonication. For each SS the pair
of two peaks with ΔorgaqΦ1/2 = −76 mV was detected indicating the presence of cocaine.
For SS04 some irregular spikes around −150 mV were observed
indicating the presence of surface active species (presumably in the
aqueous phase) leading to a phenomenon known as electrochemical instability.61 Based on the height of the voltammetric signal
and the calibration curve from Figure S5B, the purity of each sample was estimated to be SS01, 70%; SS02,
8%; SS03, 82%; and SS04, 98%. When it comes to real applications,
the practical limitations of the electrochemical cells (glass four
electrode cell or micropore-capillaries) used in this work can be
overcome with the screen printing technology and miniaturization.62 Another recognized practical limitation pertains
to the volatility of the organic phase, which can be solved by the
formation of a so-called organo-gel phase63 or by simple replacement with nontoxic hydrophobic ionic liquids.41

ion transfer is expected. Panel C is the picture of a street sample

μg/mL. All voltammograms were recorded at 10 mV/s. The aqueous
phase was 10 mM HCl. Graphs and pictures in the rows correspond to
the indicated street sample.

Conclusions
The proposed method shows how ITIES can be used
to detect cocaine,
even from complex mixtures such as cocaine street samples. The selectivity
of the system is purely based on molecular partitioning being governed
by the molecular structure. Most of the investigated cutting agents
were electrochemically inactive or gave a signal at potentials distinct
from the potential of cocaine ion transfer. Electroanalytical detection
of cocaine was performed at macro- and microITIES. For both systems,
detection spans from μM to mM with the limits of detection approaching
a few μM. Further improvement in cocaine sensing with the help
of ITIES is envisaged.
