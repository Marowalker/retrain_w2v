We report herein the development
of a simple, sensitive colorimetric
magnetic nanoparticle (MNP)–enzyme-based DNA sandwich assay
that is suitable for simultaneous, label-free quantitation of two
DNA targets down to 50 fM level. It can also effectively discriminate
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes associated with human
cancers (KRAS codon 12/13 SNPs). This assay uses a pair of specific
DNA probes, one being covalently conjugated to an MNP for target capture
and the other being linked to an enzyme for signal amplification,
to sandwich a DNA target, allowing for convenient magnetic separation
and subsequent efficient enzymatic signal amplification for high sensitivity.
Careful optimization of the MNP surfaces and assay conditions greatly
reduced the background, allowing for sensitive, specific detection
of as little as 5 amol (50 fM in 100 μL) of target DNA. Moreover,
this sensor is robust, it can effectively discriminate cancer-specific
SNPs against the wild-type noncancer target, and it works efficiently
in 10% human serum. Furthermore, this sensor can simultaneously quantitate
two different DNA targets by using two pairs of unique capture- and
signal-DNA probes specific for each target. This general, simple,
and sensitive DNA sensor appears to be well-suited for a wide range
of genetics-based biosensing and diagnostic applications.

==== Body
The development
of biosensors
capable of rapid, sensitive detection of specific genetic biomarkers
is critical to health care, allowing diagnosis of diseases, prediction
of patients’ responses to treatment, and risk of relapse of
disease.1,2 The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the
most widely used technique for DNA detection due to its great, exponential
amplification capability.3 However, as
a paradox of its great amplification power, even a tiny amount of
contaminant can result in a non-negligible false positive which can
affect diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, PCR requires a relatively clean
lab environment and long assay period, making it less well-suited
for rapid, on-site diagnosis. Therefore, alternative, PCR-free based
DNA sensing approaches have been actively exploited over the past
decade, among which, several gold nanoparticle (GNP)-based methods,
e.g., silver-amplified scannometric assay,4 silver-amplified electric detection,5 silver-amplified Raman finger printing,6 and magnetic microparticle-assisted DNA nanobarcode assay,7 have exhibited exceptional promise. They displayed
excellent sensitivities and specificities for DNA detection, down
to the femtomole per liter to attomole per liter level, making them
potentially suitable for direct target detection without the need
of PCR preamplification. Despite these, most assays use surface-immobilized
DNA probes for soluble target capture, a heterogeneous process that
often suffers from slow binding kinetics and low capture efficiency.
As a result, a relatively long period for target capture and GNP sandwich
binding (ca. 6–8 h) is required,4−6 making them less well-suited
for rapid detection.

Meanwhile, functional nanoparticles, such
as quantum dots, metal
nanoparticles, and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), have unique, size-dependent
optical and electrical properties that are well-suited for biosensing.
In this regard, MNPs are extremely well-suited because of several
attractive properties, e.g., ease of synthesis, versatile surface
modification strategies, good stability, low toxicity, and moreover
their superparamagnetic properties. As a result, they form stable,
uniform dispersions in the media for homogeneous, rapid, and efficient
target capture without an external magnetic field, but are readily
collected and separated from the media upon applying an external magnetic
field. Moreover, a large excess of MNP capture probes can be used
to push the equilibrium of the target–probe binding toward
the captured state, allowing efficient target detection at concentrations
far below the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd).7,8 These make them extremely well-suited
for biosensing, bioseparation, and biocatalysis. Meanwhile, enzymes
are extremely versatile, efficient biocatalysts with great substrate
turnover (signal amplification) power, making them attractive for
ultrasensitive biosensing. In fact, some of most widely used commercial
diagnostic assays, e.g., the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA),
are based on enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and alkaline
phosphatase (ALP). Enzymes have been combined with electrochemical,
electrochemiluminescence, colorimetric, and fluorimetric readout strategies
in sensing, among which, electrochemical readout is widely used in
point-of-care (PoC) diagnostics (e.g., the famous personal glucose
meter).9 Despite high convenience, such
PoC diagnostics are mostly suitable for highly abundant targets due
to limited sensitivity (e.g., micromoles per liter to millimoles per
liter). For early diagnosis, a much higher sensitivity is needed.1,2 Furthermore, most DNA sensors have been demonstrated with a single
target, which can limit diagnostic accuracy because “no tumor marker identified to date is sufficiently sensitive or specific
to be used on its own to screen for cancer”.10 Therefore, the ability of detecting multiple
analytes simultaneously is important to high diagnostic accuracy.
In this regard, several multiplexed biodetection methods have been
reported, including the giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensor,11 multicolor GNP surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy
(SERS) fingerprinting,6 GNP multicolor
nanobeacons,1 multicolor molecular beacons
(MBs),12 and graphene quenched multicolor
sensors.13 Nevertheless, the sensitivity
of most approaches (e.g., high picomole per liter to low nanomole
per liter for the latter three) needs to be improved considerably
to make them competitive against existing clinical diagnostic assays.
By combining the advantageous properties of both MNP and enzymes,
here we have developed a simple, sensitive MNP–enzyme sandwich
assay suitable for label-free quantitation of two DNA targets. We
show this sensor is sensitive (50 fM), robust (works in 10% human
serum), and specific (can efficiently discriminate cancer-specific
single-base mutants from the wild-type noncancer target).

Instruments
UV–vis
spectra were recorded on
a Cary 50 Bio UV–vis spectrophotometer with 1.0 cm optical
path length.15 The spectra were corrected
by their respective buffer background. The HRP-based DNA detection
limit assay was monitored by fluorescence time trace on an Envision
plate reader using BODIPY TMR FP 531 as excitation filter and Cy3
595 as emission filter.18 The powder X-ray
diffractogram was performed on PANalytical’s X’Pert
PRO materials research diffractometer (MRD) using a scan range (2θ)
of 10–90° at increments of 0.0332°. The magnetization
measurement was carried out on a MagLab vibration sample magnetometer
(Oxford Instruments) at 55 Hz with amplitude of 1.5 mm. The samples
were measured at room temperature (RT) at a scan rate of 9.17 mT·s–1.15a

General Assay
Procedure
The capture DNAs (cDNAs) were
covalently conjugated to amine-modified MNPs via a heterofunctional
cross-linker SM(PEG)12 (Supporting
Information). The PEGylated cross-linker is used because it
can effectively resist nonspecific adsorption,25 greatly reducing background. The cDNA loading on the MNP
was estimated by our previous method.18 The signal DNA (sDNA) was linked to neutravidin (NAV), HRP, or ALP
conjugate via the strong biotin–NAV interaction at 1:1 molar
ratio.15 For a typical UV–vis assay,
MNP–cDNA (20 μg), HRP–sDNA (5 pmol), and various
amounts of T-DNA were mixed to make a series of samples (final volume:
500 μL in PBS containing 1 mg/mL BSA). After incubation for
1 h at RT, the MNP–dsDNA–En sandwiches were separated
magnetically and the clear supernatants were discarded. The MNPs were
washed with PBS once, PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 twice, and finally PBS
once again to remove any unbound species. The MNP sandwiches were
then dispersed in PBS (380 μL), and enzymatic amplification
was initiated by adding Amplex red/H2O2 (50
μL each, both 0.2 mM). After a certain period, 20 μL of
N3Na (1 M) was added to stop further amplification and
the UV–vis spectra of the supernatants were recorded.

For ALP-based assay, the procedures were the same as above, except
where sDNA2–ALP and FDP were used. All assays and washing steps
were performed in Tris buffer. The termination of enzyme amplification
was achieved by adding 20 μL of PBS to the assay solution. For
simultaneous quantitation of two DNA targets, the whole assay was
carried out in Tris buffer using a mixture of MNP–cDNA1 and
MNP–cDNA2 (15 μg each). After sandwich binding and washing
steps, FDP and Amplex red were added simultaneously to initiate enzymatic
amplifications. All other assay details are given in the Supporting Information.

Results and Discussion
The principle of the MNP–enzyme sandwich assay for simultaneous
detection of two T-DNAs is shown schematically in Scheme 1. Two sets of unique MNP-capture and En-signal probes
are used to target two specific T-DNAs (e.g., MNP–cDNA1/HRP–sDNA1
for T-DNA1; MNP–cDNA2/ALP–sDNA2 for T-DNA2). In the
presence of T-DNA1, HRP–sDNA1 will bind to MNP–cDNA1
via specific sandwich hybridization, while T-DNA2 will link ALP–sDNA2
to MNP–cDNA2. All these are performed in homogeneous solutions,
allowing for efficient, rapid T-DNA capture and conversion of each
captured T-DNA1 or T-DNA2 into an HRP or ALP for signal amplification.
A large excess of MNP–cDNA and sDNA–En probes (10–200 000-fold
molar equivalent of T-DNA, depending on T-DNA concentration) is used
to push the equilibrium of the MNP–cDNA/T-DNA/sDNA–En
sandwich hybridization toward the hybridized state. A high cDNA loading
on the MNP (each conjugated to several hundred copies of cDNAs, only
one is shown here for simplicity) is used to enhance T-DNA capture
efficiency and binding affinity.14 Moreover,
we have previously found that MNP-immobilized enzymes retained much
higher activities over those on flat surfaces (∼5-fold) from
improved substrate accessibility.15 All
these lead to significantly improved sensitivity. After magnetic separation,
followed by washing steps, Amplex red and fluorescein diphosphate
(FDP), which can be efficiently turned over by HRP and ALP into resorufin
(λmax = 571 nm) and fluorescein (λmax = 485 nm), respectively, are added simultaneously. This allows the
HRP/ALP-catalyzed reactions to be used for T-DNA1/T-DNA2 detection,
respectively.

Scheme 1 Principle of the MNP–Enzyme Sandwich Assay
for Simultaneous
Detection of Two DNA Targets Using Two Sets of Unique MNP–cDNA
and sDNA–En Probes
The cDNA and sDNA
probes are
complementary to each half of their DNA targets for specific sandwich
hybridization, linking HRP (with T-DNA1) or ALP (with T-DNA2) to the
MNP. Therefore, HRP/ALP-amplified enzyme products, resorufin (λmax = 571 nm) and fluorescein (λmax = 485
nm), are used to quantitate T-DNA1/T-DNA2, respectively.

Enzyme Activity and Termination
This assay uses specific
colored products generated by HRP/ALP-catalyzed reactions for T-DNA1/T-DNA2
detection. It is useful to be able to terminate the enzymatic reaction
after a certain amplifying period before measurement. Here, NaN3 and PBS are found to effectively stop the HRP- and ALP-catalyzed
reactions, respectively (Supporting Information, Figure S1). Moreover, the substrate turnover rate (TR) for HRP–NAV
and ALP–NAV can be estimated from the assay slopes and ε
of resorufin (54 000 M–1·cm–1) and fluorescein (50 400 M–1·cm–1) via TR = slope/([enzyme]ε). This yields TRs
of 65 s–1 in PBS and 56 s–1 in
Tris buffer for HRP–NAV, and 65 s–1 for ALP–NAV
in Tris, consistent with the literature.15

Characterization of MNP and MNP–NH2
The
MNP is found to be mainly made of magnetite from the X-ray diffraction
(Fe3O4, Supporting Information, Figure S2A). A strong IR absorption at ∼569 cm–1, corresponding to the νFe–O of the magnetite
core,16 is found in both the MNP/MNP–NH2 (Supporting Information, Figure
S2B). A new band at ∼1085 cm–1 in the MNP–NH2 maybe assigned to the νSi–O of the
silica shell. In addition, a broad band at ∼3440 cm–1 in the MNP–NH2 may be assigned to νN–H or νO–H. These results are
consistent with the MNP being successfully coated with an aminenated
silica shell. Hydrodynamic diameters (HDs) of the MNP and MNP–NH2 were measured as 28.9 ± 5.3 and 178 ± 26 nm, respectively,
by dynamic light scattering17 (Supporting Information, Figure S2C). The MNP–NH2 shows no apparent hysteresis with a saturated magnetization
of ∼40 emu/g in its magnetization curve (Supporting Information, Figure S2D), lower than the MNP core
(ca. ∼90 emu/g),15a but is consistent
with the coating of a nonmagnetic shell. This confirms the MNP–NH2 is superparamagnetic and well-suited for biosensing: they
form a stable, uniform dispersion in water but can be rapidly retrieved
(1 min) with a magnet (Supporting Information, Figure S3).

Assay Optimization
A series of experiments
are performed
to optimize this assay.

First, MNP Surface Passivation
The
MNP–NH2 was first reacted with excess SM(PEG)12 to introduce
maleimides for cDNA conjugation, where any unreacted maleimides on
the MNP could lead to nonspecific enzyme adsorption and increasing
background. A treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol (to cap unreacted maleimides)
followed by bovine serum albumin blocking (1 mg/mL) was found highly
effective, leading to a greatly improved signal to background (S/B)
ratio (from ∼4.4 to ∼62, Supporting
Information Figure S4A).

Second, Amount of MNP–cDNA
Despite of surface
passivation, this cannot eliminate nonspecific adsorption of enzymes
on the MNPs completely. Supporting Information Figure S4B showed assay signal increased with the increasing amount
of MNP–cDNA1, indicating more efficient T-DNA capture; however,
the background also increased. As a result, the net signal arising
from T-DNA1 actually decreased when >20 μg of MNP was used.
Therefore, 20 μg MNP–cDNA was used for subsequent colorimetric
sensing. Despite giving a weaker net T-DNA1 signal, 10 μg MNP–cDNA
actually yielded the highest S/B ratio, so 10 μg MNP was used
to assess the detection limit via fluorescence (both enzymatic products
are fluorescent).

Third, Temperature
Supporting Information Figure S4C revealed that assay sensitivity
was strongly temperature-dependent:
a 140% increase of sensitivity was observed as temperature was increased
from 4 to 24 °C (∼RT) but no further increase was shown
as temperature was increased to 37 °C. Hence, all assays were
carried out conveniently at RT.19

Fourth,
cDNA Loading
Increasing the cDNA loading on
the MNP can increase the affinity and amount of cDNAs available for
T-DNA hybridization, and hence may increase capture efficiency. Figure
S4D (Supporting Information) shows that
the sensitivity increases first with the increasing cDNA loading,
reaching the maximum value at ∼0.5 nmol/mg (MNP). This loading
was used for all subsequent assays.

DNA1 Quantitation Using
HRP-Based Signal Amplification
The optimized conditions were
used to quantitate T-DNA1 using MNP–cDNA1/HRP–sDNA1.
Figure 1 shows the absorption spectra of assay
samples and the resulting calibration curve (1 h amplification). An
extremely low background (sample without T-DNA1, A571 = 0.0045 ± 0.0003) is observed. The signal is
increased greatly with the T-DNA1 concentration, confirming the success
of our assay strategy. In fact, the signal at 1 nM T-DNA1 (0.801 ±
0.043) is ∼177 times that of the blank, demonstrating an excellent
S/B ratio and further confirming the success of our assay optimizations.
A high S/B ratio is very beneficial for biosensing, allowing for direct,
accurate target quantitation without the need of background correction.

Figure 1 (A) Absorption

of T-DNA1 using 1 h amplification. Inset: a photograph of the corresponding
samples. (B) The resulting calibration curve for T-DNA1 quantification.
Inset: amplified region over the 0–200 pM T-DNA1 range fitted
to a linear function.

Like typical enzymatic reactions, the whole calibration curve
initially
displays a rapid linear increase with T-DNA1 concentration up to 200
pM (R2 = 0.998, Figure 1B inset). As T-DNA1 concentration is increased further, the
calibration curve deviates from linear and gradually becomes saturated,
due to depleted Amplex red at higher target DNA (hence HRP) concentrations.
This overall calibration curve could be fitted well (R2 = 0.991) by the Hill equation, yielding an apparent k of 394 nM (KM minic of enzyme
activity) and n of 1.06, suggesting no strong target-binding
cooperation.

We have evaluated the effect of amplification time
on assay sensitivity.
As shown in Figure 2, over the whole 0–1
nM range, the calibration curves showed good linearity up to 120 min
of amplification time. As amplification time is extended further to
>180 min, the calibration curves deviate from linearity, due to
depletion
of the substrates under such conditions (10 μM Amplex red/H2O2). A careful examination of the calibration curves
over the 0–100 pM range (Figure 2B)
reveals all curves are linear. Besides, the corresponding slopes (representing
sensitivity) are found to increase linearly with the amplification
time (R2 = 0.996, Figure 2C), suggesting the sensitivity can be increased by extending
the amplification time.

enzymatic amplification times (0–300 min; the amplification
times are indicated on each curve). (B) The amplified region over
the 0–100 pM T-DNA1 range, and data were fitted to linear relationships.
(C) The relationship between the corresponding slopes of calibration
curves in panel B and the enzymatic amplification times.

A large and systematically tunable dynamic range
is important for
biosensing. Here, we show that the amplification time can be used
to tune the dynamic range and sensitivity: the dynamic range can be
enlarged by reducing amplification time, while increasing the amplification
time can be used to improve assay sensitivity. For example, by extending
the amplification time from 1 h to overnight (∼15 h), this
assay can directly detect 100 fM T-DNA unambiguously by UV–vis
spectra with a good linearity over the 0–10 pM range (R2 =0.990, Figure 3).

detected by MNP–cDNA3 and HRP–sDNA3 with overnight amplification.
Inset: calibration curve with linear fit; y = 0.0417
+ 0.0314x, R2 = 0.990.

Moreover, by adapting a more sensitive
readout using a conventional
fluorescence plate reader,18 this assay
can detect 50 fM T-DNA3 directly without target preamplification over
2 h (Supporting Information, Figure S5).
Such a sensitivity is higher than many other sensitive, direct DNA
sensing techniques, e.g., GNP-amplified surface plasmon resonance
(∼10 pM),20 microcantilever-based
nanomechanical sensing (∼10 pM),21 electrochemical DNA sensing (10–50 pM),22 enzyme-amplified electrochemical DNA sensing with a DNA
tetrahedron (1 pM),23 and silver nanoparticle
amplified surface-enhanced Raman scattering (1.1–33 pM).24 It is also comparable to some ultrasensitive
DNA assays, e.g., silver-amplified GNP–DNA-based scannometric
assay/electric detection (∼50 fM),4,5 electrochemical
DNA sensing via enzymatic amplification (∼10 fM),22a or via a DNA supersandwich assembly (∼100
fM).22c Another advantage here is that
the MNP–target–En sandwiches can be easily retrieved
magnetically, allowing MNP-bound species to be concentrated or diluted
where required, which can be further combined with the tuning of amplification
time to achieve the most desirable dynamic range and sensitivity for
each specific assay needs.

The ability to perform assays in
complex, clinical media is important
for real-world applications. To demonstrate this potential, T-DNA1
detection was carried out in 10% human serum (a clinical media, 1
h amplification). Figure S6 (Supporting Information) reveals the T-DNA1 detection is unaffected in 10% human serum,
yielding a good linear calibration curve (R2 = 0.999). This demonstrates the MNP–enzyme assay is highly
robust and works efficiently in complex media. We attribute this to
the careful management of the MNP surfaces and assay conditions, leading
to greatly reduced background and excellent assay robustness.

Stability of MNP–cDNA probe is another important parameter.
Here we have performed T-DNA detection using MNP–cDNA probes
after being stored for up to 5 months at 4 °C in pure water and
compared the result with the fresh probes. Results show that not only
have the 5 month old MNP–cDNA probes remained magnetically
responsive, but they also give similar sensitivities (calibration
slopes) to the fresh MNP–cDNA (Supporting
Information, Figure S7), confirming the MNP–cDNA probe
has good long-term stability.

T-DNA2 Detection Using
ALP-Based Signal Amplification
The ALP-catalyzed turnover
of FDP into fluorescein (λmax = 485 nm) was used
to detect T-DNA2 using MNP–cDNA2 and ALP–sDNA2
probes. The assay was done in Tris buffer because PBS inhibits the
ALP activity (Supporting Information Figure
S1).26 The resulting absorption spectra
of assay samples (1 h amplification) and the corresponding calibration
curve are shown in Figure 4. A good positive
linear calibration curve (R2 = 0.994)
over the 0–200 pM range is obtained, suggesting that ALP is
just as powerful as HRP in signal amplification, allowing direct quantitation
of low picomole per liter T-DNA2 with 1 h amplification.

concentrations of T-DNA2 using ALP-based signal amplification. (B)

Simultaneous Quantification
of Two T-DNAs
The ability
to simultaneously detect two or more DNA targets is important for
high clinical diagnostic accuracy.10 To
demonstrate this potential, two sets of MNP–cDNA and En–sDNA
probes are used to detect two specific T-DNAs via HRP- and ALP-catalyzed
reactions, respectively (Scheme 1).

Figure 5A shows the absorbance of both resorufin (A571) and fluorescein (A485) increased significantly with the increasing T-DNA1/T-DNA2
concentration (1 h amplification). Moreover, the correlations between
the absorbance and T-DNA concentrations are both linear (R2 = 0.975 for T-DNA1 and 0.994 for T-DNA2) over the 0–500
pM range (Figure 5B). Interestingly, both plots
yield very similar slopes (sensitivities), in agreement with their
similar substrate turnover rates.

Figure 5 Simultaneous quantification of two DNA
targets using the MNP–enzyme
sandwich assay. (A) Absorption spectra of the assay samples with different
amounts of T-DNAs; T-DNA1/T-DNA2 molar ratio = 1:1. (B) The corresponding
calibration curves for both DNA targets: data within the 0–500
pM range were both fitted to linear functions.

These results thus established a simple, general, and versatile
doublet DNA assay that can be applied to target any DNA of interest
by designing a pair of unique MNP–cDNA and En–sDNA probes
for each specific T-DNA. Additional advantages here include (1) the
use of MNP-based homogeneous, rapid target capture, (2) convenient
magnetic separation for low assay background, and (3) the use of large
excesses of MNP–cDNA/En–sDNA probes to push T-DNA hybridization
equilibrium toward the captured state, allowing efficient capture
and detection of T-DNA at concentrations well below the corresponding Kd.2,7,8 As a result, this simple DNA assay can offer superior sensitivity
and specificity over many other more established DNA sensing methods
(see Supporting Information Table S1) and
appears well-suited for broad DNA-based biosensing and diagnostics.

Discrimination of Cancer-Specific Single-Base Mutation
Genetic
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is associated with numerous
human diseases, e.g., cancer, diabetes, vascular disease, and some
forms of mental illness.28,29 To demonstrate the
potential of our assay in SNP discrimination, the KRAS mutations (codon
12/13) associated with several human cancers, e.g., colorectal,30 pancreas,31 and lung,32 are chosen as the DNA targets. This involves
three T-DNAs (Table 1), the wild-type (T-DNA3)
and two cancer-specific SNPs, T-DNA4 (17C → T) and T-DNA5 (17C → A). Here MNP–cDNA3 and HRP–sDNA3, fully complementary
to T-DNA3, are used (CT-DNA = 100
pM, 1 h amplification). Figure 6 shows that
the signal of the full-match T-DNA3 is considerably higher than the
two cancer-specific SNPs, confirming this assay can distinguish the
normal gene from cancer-specific SNP mutants. The discrimination ratios
(DRs) obtained here are 2.1 and 2.5 for T-DNA3/T-DNA4 and T-DNA3/T-DNA5
pairs, respectively. Reducing the assay buffer NaCl content from 150
to 100 mM improves the above SNP DRs to 3.3 and 4.2, respectively
(Supporting Information, Figure S8), comparable
to many reported DNA SNP assays, presumably because the formed MNP–dsDNA
sandwiches containing a single mismatch (with cancer-specific SNPs)
are affected more severely than the full-match wide-type target, in
agreement with the literature.27,33 Further reducing the
NaCl content to 50 mM produced significantly reduced signals for all
T-DNAs (data not shown), due to greatly reduced stability of the dsDNA
sandwich structure.

cancer-specific SNPs (T-DNA4/TDNA5) against the wild-type noncancer

Conclusion
In
summary, we have successfully developed a simple, sensitive,
and general MNP–enzyme sandwich assay that can be used for
simultaneous quantitation of two specific DNA targets in clinically
relevant media (e.g., 10% human serum). By combining the MNP-based
rapid, efficient target capture and convenient magnetic separation
and enzyme-based great signal amplification together with the careful
optimization of the MNP surface and assay conditions, this assay can
achieve direct, label-free quantitation of T-DNA down to 50 fM level
with a total assay time of <3 h (via fluorescence readout). Such
a sensing performance places it among the very best of PCR- and label-free
DNA assays in terms of both sensitivity and specificity (Supporting Information Table S1).15,34 Moreover, this assay is highly specific: it can effectively discriminate
between a normal KRAS gene from its two cancer-specific SNPs. Therefore,
we believe this robust, general, sensitive DNA sensing technology
should have great potential in a wide range of DNA-based biosensing
and diagnostic applications. Currently, we are focused on further
improving the assay sensitivity and SNP discrimination ratio and extending
its application to clinical samples.
