To
make the electrochemical DNA sensors (E-sensor) more robust
and reproducible, we have now for the first time adapted the techniques
of ratiometric analyses to the field of E-sensors. We did this via
the simple expedient way of simultaneously using two redox probes:
Methylene blue as the reporter of the conformational change, and ferrocene
as an internal control. During the conformational transduction, only
the distance between the signal probe and the electrode surface undergoes
an appreciable change, while the distance between the control probe
and the electrode remains relatively constant. This special design
has allowed very reliable target recognition, as illustrated in this
report using a human T-lymphotropic virus type I gene fragment. The
standard deviation between measurements obtained using different electrodes
was an order of magnitude less than that obtained using a classic
E-sensor, which we prepared as a control. A limit of detection of
25.1 pM was obtained with our new system, with a single mismatch discrimination
factor of 2.33 likewise being observed. Additionally, this concept
had general applicability, and preliminary data of a “Signal-On”
ratiometric E-sensor are also provided. Taken in concert, these results
serve to validate the utility of what we believe will emerge as an
easily generalized approach to oligonucleotide recognition and sensing.

==== Body
The ability to transduce the
DNA hybridization into electrochemical signals has been greatly advanced
by the development of so-called electrochemical DNA sensors (E-sensors).
The E-sensors have a variety of intrinsic advantages, including high
sensitivity, relatively low cost, and amenability to miniaturization
and multiplexing.1−3 Nucleic acid analytes, including single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), have been specifically detected by adapting
molecular beacons4 to electrochemical signaling.5 An extremely robust and adaptable design for
electrochemical signaling with molecular beacons has been developed
by the Plaxco group.6 In this design, the
distance of a redox tag to an electrode surface was altered as a consequence
of nucleic acid target-induced conformational change in the molecular
beacon (Scheme 1). Variations on this theme
have included molecular beacon E-sensors with ferrocene (Fc),7 methylene blue (MB),8 and other redox tags;9,10 transduction to both reusable6 and disposable electrodes;11 and the detection of targets ranging from short DNA6,9 to RNA12,13 to amplicons from isothermal amplification.14 To improve the sensitivity of the E-sensor,
enzyme15,16 or nanomaterial17,18 amplification of the initial conformational transduction has been
achieved; some of these transduction methods have allowed certain
DNA targets to be detected at the attomolar level.

to a complementary strand, Ligation-P, the phosphorylated HS-Fc-P
and MB-P were ligated together by T4 DNA ligase.

As with many other electrochemical biosensors, a barrier to the
wider adoption of E-sensors as analytical devices are recognized problems
relating to reproducibility, robustness, and reliability, which in
turn stem from hard-to-avoid variations in electrode areas, DNA loading
densities, and nontarget-induced reagent degradation/dissociation.
This can lead to differences in the initial background currents on
different sensing electrodes. The idiosyncratic background currents
observed with disparate electrodes make direct determination of target
binding unreliable, ultimately requiring time-consuming background
scans with each new electrode or in each new analysis. Relative signal
changes before and after the addition of target can be carried out
for individual electrodes;19,20 however, such methods
are inconvenient and considered impractical for potential point-of-care
devices. Moreover, using such methods it is difficult to confirm whether
the observed signal changes are due to target binding or deterioration
of the sensing surface.

In this paper, we describe a simple
ratiometric method for improving
the robustness and reproducibility of E-sensors, specifically, a new
“ratiometric E-sensor”. As detailed below, we build
on the basic Plaxco’s E-sensor approach, starting from their
first “Signal-Off” strategy. We have done so because
such E-sensors are reagentless and thus excellent candidates for the
development of point-of-care diagnostics.8,19,21 However, the inclusion of the two redox
components uniquely addresses the shortcomings noted above, especially
in relation to variations that arise from different DNA loading densities
and nontarget-induced reagent degradation/dissociation. The ratiometric
E-sensor we describe here is expected to be general and thus readily
extrapolated to create a range of other oligonucleotide electrochemical
DNA or aptamer-based biosensors that rely on the same or other conformational
transduction principles.3,22−25 Support for this contention comes from a demonstration that it may
also be used effectively for “Signal-On” sensing.

Results
and Discussion
The ratiometric method we describe here is
based on the use of
two electrochemical probes in parallel. In addition to the classic
signal probe (MB) found in other E-sensors, we have included another
redox probe, Fc, as a control. The design principle is that, during
target-induced conformational transduction, only the distance between
the signal probe (MB) and the electrode will be changed, while the
relative distance between the control probe (Fc) and the electrode
should remain constant. Therefore, the control probe is expected to
serve as an internal control.

To demonstrate the utility of
our ratiometric standardization,
we designed a “Signal-Off” E-DNA sensor6 similar to one reported previously by Plaxco and co-workers.
However, in addition to adding a second redox component, we changed
the target sequence so as to detect sequences present in the human
T-lymphotropic virus type I gene (Target T).26 As shown in Scheme 1, a 37-mer molecular
beacon (Probe P) was immobilized on a hand-polished gold disk electrode
via a 3′ thiol (Scheme 1A). Probe P
was constructed by enzymatically ligation of an HS- and Fc-labeled
oligonucleotide (HS-Fc-P) with a MB-labeled oligonucleotide (MB-P). HS-Fc-P
was synthesized using a
commercial 3′-thiol modifier solid phase column and a Fc-modified
thymidine (T) phosphoramidite (compound 1) (Scheme 1B; see the Supporting Information for characterization and experimental details). MB-P was obtained
from a commercial supplier.

As shown in Scheme 1A and Figure 1, in the absence of the
target, both the Fc and
MB tags are held in proximity to the electrode and yield effective
electron transfer signals at 0.440 and −0.265 V (vs Ag/AgCl.
Two M NaCl), respectively. The Fc probe was chosen because its E° is well-separated from that of MB. Figure 1 shows square wave voltammetry (SWV) curves from
three different electrodes. As hypothesized, under standard experimental
operation, irrespective of differences in electrode areas, probe densities,
or idiosyncracies of cleaning, the background current ratio between
MB and Fc was generally the same on each sensing surface.

between non-ratiometric and ratiometric E-sensors. (A)
Typical SWV curves scanned prior to target binding on three different
sensing electrodes. (B) Reproducibility of the nonratiometric E-sensor.
(C) Reproducibility of the ratiometric E-sensor. Throughout, (IMB)0 refers to the initial background
response of MB prior to target binding. (IMB/IFc)0 refers to the initial
background ratio of MB and Fc signals prior to target binding. The
black histograms represent the background responses of 50 individual
measurements over eight electrodes. Average values are represented
by the red bars. The error bars in the red histograms represent the
SD for 50 individual measurements.

To confirm that the ratiometric E-sensor (containing both
MB and
Fc) is highly reproducible relative to the non-ratiometric E-sensor
(containing only MB), the initial background SWV peak currents of
MB ((IMB)0) and Fc ((IFc)0) and the initial background
current ratios of ((IMB/IFc)0) before target detection were collected
over 50 individual measurements (Figure 1B
and C). These data were obtained using eight electrodes, including
the same electrodes on different days and different electrodes on
the same day. Similar to the classic E-sensor, the background (IMB)0 response in these 50 tests showed
wide variation (Figure 1B) with an average
(standard deviation, SD) of 5.54 × 10–7 A and
a variance of 1.21. However, in our ratiometric E-sensor the variation
in background signal was significantly reduced ((IMB/IFc)0; Figure 1C) with an average background ratio response of
4.13 and a variance of 0.14. The ratiometric approach was far more
robust, reliable, and reproducible than the previous approach that
relied on electrochemical “absolute values”.

In
response to the target sequence (Target T, at, e.g., 500 nM),
the Probe P undergoes a conformational change due to formation of
a P-T duplex. While the Faradaic current from the 3′ Fc tag
was almost unchanged (presumably since its distance to the electrode,
d1 remained unchanged), the 5′ MB tag showed a sharp decrease
in current, consistent with it being further away from the electrode
(d2 goes to d2-T) (Scheme 1A and Figure 2).

Figure 2 Typical SWV curves as obtained before and after target
binding.
The peak current from Fc is normalized for each curve.

In order to confirm that electrochemical signals
were due to nucleic
acid hybridization and conformational changes rather than other unattributed
effects, the behavior of Probe P was analyzed using native polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (Figure 3). As can
be seen from inspection of Figures 3A (using
unlabeled Probe P and Target T) and 3B (using MB- and Fc-labeled Probe
P and Target T), a higher band was observed only in the presence of
Target T (lanes 2–4, 8, and 9). Moreover, the density of this
band was in direct proportion to the target added. Interestingly,
the presence of one or both electrochemical tags on Probe P reduced
SYBR Gold staining fluorescence (blue arrow in Figure 3B, lane 6). Nevertheless, evidence for hybridization between
Probe P and Target T was observed (Figure 3B, lanes 8 and 9). In addition to electrophoresis, cyclic voltammetry
(CV) and chronocoulometry (CC) were used to validate the addition
of, and changes to, molecules during the sensor fabrication and detection
process (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information).

were developed on a 12% native PAGE. (A) Unlabeled Probe P, lane 1:
[T] = 100 nM; lanes 2 and 4: [P] = [T] = 100 nM; lane 3: [P] = 2[T]
= 100 nM; lane 5: [P] = 100 nM. (B) HS- and Fc- and MB-labeled Probe

= [T] = 200 nM. The mobilities of the different conformers are indicated
at the sides of the gels. The arrow indicates a faint band, as described
in the text.

A dose–response
curve was prepared for the ratiometric E-sensor
by monitoring the SWV peak current ratio between the MB current and
the Fc current (IMB/IFc) after Target T detection. Such analyses provide a
complement to measurements of the absolute MB current value (IMB) or the relative current (IMB/(IMB)0). They
are attractive because they are potentially more reproducible. To
construct these curves, data were collected using different electrodes.
As can be seen from an inspection of Figure 4A and B, the response varied in a log–linear fashion with
the target concentration, as expected. Target T concentrations from
50 pM to 1 μM could be measured, with the highest ratio signal
suppression being around 50% from the background and an overall R2 = 0.997. The detection limit (LOD) at a signal-to-noise
ratio of 3 was calculated to be 25.1 pM, comparable with the non-ratiometric
or classic E-DNA sensor.6 However, in contrast
to this latter classic approach, control studies carried out using
just the signal probe MB (IMB) revealed
relatively large standard deviations and an overall R2 of 0.958, although peak current suppression with increasing
target concentration was seen (Figure 4C and
D). The lower reliability observed with the control system is ascribed
to the variance in the background signal (IMB)0 discussed above (cf. Figure 1B).

Figure 4 Concentration dependence of Target T as observed using ratiometric
E-sensors and non-ratiometric E-sensors. (A) Concentration dependence
of Target T based on the ratio IMB/IFc. (B) Concentration dependence of Target T
represented by a log–linear plot of IMB/IFc. (C) Concentration dependence
of Target T based on IMB. (D) Concentration
dependence of Target T represented by log–linear plot of IMB. The error bars are standard deviations of
measurements based on three independent experiments.

To ensure that the signals observed were due to
the specific hybridization
of Target T to the probe sequence (Probe P), a series of control experiments
were carried out with noncomplementary DNA (Non-T), and with targets
containing 1–4 mismatches (T-SNP1, T-SNP2, T-SNP3, and T-SNP4).
The targets that contained three or more mismatches produced no observable
interactions with Probe P, while single and double mismatches gave
signals smaller than the completely matched target (Figure 5A). As with non-ratiometric E-sensors, it is anticipated
that long targets will yield larger signal changes than shorter targets,
but that the specificity of long targets will be poorer than that
of shorter targets.27

E-sensor. (A) Transduction by Probe
P with a series matched and mismatched targets at 25 °C. Buffer

(5), 1 μM T-SNP1 (1 mismatch) (6), and correctly paired Target
T (7). (B) Selectivity at different temperatures. T-SNP1 and T-SNP2
contain 1 and 2 mismatches relative to Target T, respectively.

More quantitatively, the single-base
mismatch discrimination factor
can be defined as the ratio of the decrease in signal with a perfectly
paired target (ΔIMB/IFc) versus that seen with a mismatched target. The larger
the discrimination factor is, the better the specificity for single-base
mismatch will be. The discrimination factor for the single-base mismatched
sequence T-SNP1 was 1.60 at 25 °C. Increasing the temperature
should increase the level of discrimination.28,29 In the present instance, increasing the temperature to 37 °C,
resulted in a discrimination value of 2.50 (Figure 5B). These latter values are comparable to those obtained with
E-sensors,7 where a discrimination factor
of 2.33 was noted. However, our internally controlled, double redox
sensor shows mismatch discrimination comparable to those of fluorescence
methods (discrimination factor of 2.18),30 and somewhat better than those of similar experiments that have
been reported in the context of electrochemistry (1.67),31 colorimetry (1.33),32 surface plasmon resonance (1.67),33 quartz
crystal microbalance (1.22),33 or surface-enhanced
Raman scattering (1.33) sensing.34 Based
on prior studies, it is anticipated that additional mutation discrimination
could likely be obtained by manipulating salt concentrations and other
buffer components.35 Optimization efforts
along these latter lines are in progress.

Notably, the HS-Fc-P
used in the “Signal-Off” ratiometric
E-sensor contained four Fc labels to ensure an adequate peak current
signal during the SWV scan. While SWV scans are fast (they can be
carried out within 10 s), typically they give rise to relatively decreased
peak currents as the result of mainly the high charging/background
current (near E0 of Fc) required. Alternatively,
if alternating current voltammetry (ACV) or differential pulse voltammetry
(DPV) techniques are employed, a much slower scan rate (see Experimental Section) can be accommodated, as shown
in Figure 6A below. However, upward of 5 min
is required for each scan.

Figure 6 (A) Schematic view of a “Signal-On”
E-DNA sensor
that relies on a ratiometric reporter. (B) Typical ACV curves scanned
prior to target binding on three different sensing electrodes for
the “Signal-On” ratiometric E-sensor. (C) IMB/IFc response obtained before
(buffer, negative control) and after target binding.

We have also carried out additional experiments
to show the utility
of the present ratiometric approach in the context of a “Signal-On”
E-sensor. The basic sensor design was the same as has been previously
demonstrated (Figure 6A), except that a Fc
label was covalently added to the 3′ end of Probe ON-P2. To
also demonstrate the facility with which ratiometric sensors can be
generated, the dual-labeled Probe ON-P2 oligonucleotide was not synthesized
in house. Rather, it was ordered directly from Biosearch Technologies.
The generality of the ratiometric approach was further emphasized
by using ACV for measurements rather than SWV.

Briefly, MB-
and Fc-labeled Probe ON-P2 was hybridized with Probe
SH-ON-P1 that had been preimmobilized on the gold surface, leaving
a loop in the middle of the duplex. Target sequence (Target ON-T)
can bind the loop sequence thereby triggering a strand displacement
reaction that releases the MB-labeled 5′ terminal of Probe
ON-P2. Since the released MB has more chances to approach the gold
surface, the MB signal increases. However, the relative distance between
the immobilized Fc label and the electrode does not change as the
result of this release. Therefore, readings from the Fc subunit serve
as an unmodulated internal control. This permits ratiometric sensing
and its attendant advantages in terms of sensitivity and reproducibility.

In general, the present ratiometric “Signal-On” E-sensor
proved much more robust, reliable, and reproducible than sensors that
relied on the peak current alone as a read out indicator. Different
electrodes gave different IMB0 values (see Figure 6B for examples). The
average value of IMB0 for eight
different electrodes was 1.254 × 10–8 A with
a variance (SD) of 0.286. In contrast, the average value of (IMB/IFc)0 for eight different electrodes was much more reliable, 0.320 with
a variance of 0.013. Moreover, because the signal gain is no longer
limited by background current, exposure to 10 nM of the target produced
a near 100% signal increase in IMB/IFc over (IMB/IFc)0 (Figure 6C). The ratiometric “Signal-Off” E-sensor
10 nM target produced about a 25% signal decrease in IMB/IFc.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have developed a novel ratiometric method that
greatly improves the performance of E-sensors. By importing an internal
control redox probe into the sensing platform, we have overcome a
disadvantage of electrochemical DNA sensors, namely, irreproducibility,
and have done so without loss of sensitivity or selectivity. An additional
potential advantage of the MB/Fc approach detailed here is that the
current ratio prior to target binding can be used as a positive control
to validate electrode function. This is useful since drastic variations
in the baseline ratio over time can be indicative of a faulty electrode.

It is likely that this advance can also be applied to other types
of E-sensors, including those based on aptamer refolding in the presence
of a ligand.3,22,23,25,36−40 Efforts are currently being made to extrapolate the present approach
in such directions. The key point is that, in any configuration, the
analyte-dependent signal can be read out directly by simply calculating
the current ratio between MB and Fc (or some other appropriate redox
probe). In other words, even if the change in the relative current
response cannot be readily predicted (or correlated accurately with
target concentration), the change in the current ratio will be indicative
of target binding. We thus deem the approach described here as useful
and attractive as a potentially generalizable approach to oligonucleotide
sensor development.

Instruments
Square wave voltammetry was performed with
a model CH Instrument 660E electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments,
Inc., Austin, TX). A conventional three-electrode system with a Au
electrode (1.2 mm in diameter) as the working electrode, a Ag/AgCl
electrode as the reference electrode, and a platinum wire as the counter
electrode was used. CVs were performed in a solution of 5 mM K4[Fe(CN)6]/K3[Fe(CN)6] (in
20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, pH 7.4). CCs were performed
in a solution of 0.05 mM [Ru(NH3)6]3+ (RuHex, in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). SWV and ACV were performed in
10 mM PBS, 500 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.4. The SWV parameters adopted
were as follows: Increment potential was 4 mV, amplitude was 25 mV,
frequency was 50 Hz, and voltage range was from −0.4 to 0.7
V. The ACV parameters adopted were as follows: Increment potential
of 4 mV, amplitude of 25 mV, frequency of 10 Hz, and voltage range
of −0.4 to 0.6 V. All the measurements were carried out at room
temperature (ca. 25 °C). Hybridization reactions were developed
on a 12% native polyacrylamide gel: a 20 μL aliquot of the hybridization
solution was mixed with 6 μL of 6× Loading Dye (50% glycerol
spiked with a small amount of the dye Orange G) and loaded on the
polyacrylamide gel. The gel was developed at 250 V at room temperature,
followed by SYBR Gold staining. Bands were observed and quantitated
using a Storm Scanner 840 instrument (GE Healthcare Life Science,
Pittsburgh, PA). NMR spectra for the synthesis of compound 1 were recorded on Varian Direct Drive 400 MHz and Varian MR 400 MHz
instruments, and the electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra were
recorded on an Agilent Technologies 6530 Accurate Mass QTofLC/MS apparatus.
Cyclic voltammetry was performed on a CV-50W Voltammetric Analyzer
(Bioanalytical Systems Inc., West Lafayette, IN).

Synthesis of
Compound 1 (Fc-T-phosphoramidite)
The synthesis
scheme, characterization, and other experimental
details are provided in the Supporting Information.

Synthesis of HS-Fc-P
Synthesis of the oligonucleotide
HS-Fc-P was performed on a commercial Expedite 8909 nucleic acid synthesizer
with a 0.2 μmol 3′-thiol-modifier C3 S–S CPG support
column. A standard oligodeoxynucleotide synthesis protocol was used
except that coupling times were extended (to 15 min) and a more concentrated
phosphoramidite solution (0.2 M) was employed with compound 1. The product was deprotected and purified using a Glen-Pak
DNA Purification Cartridge, and the detailed procedure provided by
the Glen Research Company (http://www.glenresearch.com/Technical/GlenPak_UserGuide.pdf).

Phosphorylation of HS-Fc-P
The phosphorylation of HS-Fc-P
was performed in 1 mL of T4 ligase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 10 mM DTT, pH 7.5) solution containing 100 μM
HS-Fc-P and 50 μL of T4 PNK (10 000 units/mL). The mixture
was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The solution was then incubated
at 65 °C for 20 min to denature the enzyme. After precipitation
with ethanol, the DNA was dissolved in 90 μL of DI water. A
G25 column was used to remove residual salts, and 90 μL of 558
μM 5′-phosphorlyated HS-Fc-P was obtained for subsequent
ligation reactions.

Ligation of MB-P to Phosphorylated HS-Fc-P
The MB-P
and 5′-phosphorlyated HS-Fc-P was ligated together with T4
DNA Ligase. Four tubes were prepared with that contained 80 μM
phosphorylated HS-Fc-P, 30 μM MB-P, 30 μM Ligation-P (see
also Scheme 1), and 1× ligation buffer
for a total of 100 μL per tube. These samples were incubated
for 5 min at 80 °C and cooled down to 25 °C at a rate of
0.1 °C/s. After this first incubation was deemed complete, 20
μL of 120 000 units of T4 DNA ligase in 1× ligation
buffer was added to each tube for a total of 120 μL per tube.
The reaction mixture was further incubated at 16 °C for 16 h,
followed by incubation at 65 °C for 20 min. After incubation,
Probe P was purified on a 12% denaturing PAGE gel (7 M urea, 1×
TBE), and its final concentration was confirmed by absorption determinations
with a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Wilmington, DE, USA).

Sensing Platform Fabrication
To cleave the S–S
of thiol-tagged Probe P, 3 μL of 16.3 μM Probe P was mixed
with 4.8 μL of 100 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP),
and this solution was incubated in the dark at room temperature for
1 h. Then, 12 μL of 2× PBS buffer and 4.2 μL of DI
water were added to that solution and stored at 4 °C for further
use. The Au electrode was polished with 1.0, 0.3, and 0.05 μm
γ-Al2O3 and then washed ultrasonically
with water for three cycles, followed by potential scanning in 0.1
M H2SO4 between −0.2 and 1.6 V until
a reproducible cyclic voltammogram was obtained. The electrode was
rinsed with a copious amount of water and blown dry with nitrogen
before assembly. The sensing platform (Au/Probe P) was prepared by
placing 4 μL of freshly prepared Probe P (2 μM) solution
on the Au electrode and then covering the end of the electrode with
a plastic cap to prevent the solution from evaporating. The assembly
was kept 1.5 h at room temperature in the dark and then rinsed with
PBS buffer several times. The interface was then covered with 5 μL
of 1 mM MCH (in PBS) and kept at room temperature for 30 min. After
rinsing with PBS buffer, the sensing platform was stored in PBS buffer
for at least 20 min prior to experimental measurements. It is worth
noting that the amount of the Probe P immobilized on the electrode
surface is an important factor in terms of responsivity. In our experiments,
the density of Probe P on the gold electrode was calculated to be
about (2.77 ± 0.23) × 1012 molecules/cm2, similar to values previously shown to be optimal for signaling.41

Sensing Protocol
Initial SWV signals
from the MB and
Fc reporters on Probe P were measured in PBS. Signals were taken after
30 min of incubation with 50 μL aliquots of different concentrations
of Target T and other sequences, as described in the text.

The Generality
of the Ratiometric E-Sensor
The sensing
platform (Au/Probe ON-P1-P2) was prepared by placing 15 μL of
freshly prepared Probe SH-ON-P1 (0.5 μM, in 200 mM Tris-HCl
containing 5 μM TCEP, pH 7.4) solution on the Au electrode for
16 h at 25 °C. The resulting surface was washed with 20 mM Tris-HCl
buffer, and then the modified Au electrode was treated with 1 mM MCH
in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h. Then, 10 μL of 2.5
μM Probe ON-P2 (in PerfectHyb Plus hybridization buffer (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO)) was placed on the Au electrode surface for 6 h to
yield the final sensing platform. The sensor interface was then immersed
in various concentrations of Target ON-T (in PerfectHyb Plus hybridization
buffer) for 4 h at 37 °C.
