Unexplored
electrochemical behavior of abiraterone, a recent and widely used
prostate cancer drug, in interaction with cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)
enzyme and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) is investigated in
this work. The results reported in this work are significant for personalized
medicine and point-of-care chemical treatment, especially to improve
the life expectancy and quality of life of patients with prostate-cancer.
To this purpose, enzymatic and nonenzymatic electrochemical biosensors
were developed and characterized with different concentrations of
abiraterone. Nonenzymatic biosensors were functionalized with MWCNTs
as a catalyst for signal enhancement, while enzymatic biosensors have
been obtained with CYP3A4 protein immobilized on MWCNTs as recognition
biomolecule. Enzymatic electrochemical experiments demonstrated an
inhibition effect on the CYP3A4, clearly observed as a diminished
electrocatalytic activity of the enzyme. Electrochemical responses
of nonenzymatic biosensors clearly demonstrated the direct electroactivity
of abiraterone when reacting with MWCNT as well as an electrode-fouling
effect.

==== Body
Abiraterone chemotherapy is a
type of hormone therapy for patients suffering from metastasized castration-resistant
prostate cancer. Administration of this agent causes testosterone
suppression, and thus, shrinking the number of testosterone-sensitive
tumor cells all over the body. Mechanism of action is based on the
inhibition of steroidogenic enzyme “17α-hydroxylase/C17,
20 lyase (CYP17A1)” that catalyzes the 17α-hydroxylation
of pregnenolone and progesterone and subsequent formation of dehydroepiandrosterone
and androstenedione, as precursors of testosterone.1

Abiraterone is now widely used for chemotherapy-naive
patients or patients treated by docetaxel. The therapeutic range is
in the range between 20 nM and 360 nM for a typical dose of 1000 mg
injected per day.2 Such a dose is the right
one to maintain the concentration of abiraterone in this range and,
therefore, to achieve a successful chemotherapy, since lower concentration
cannot provide a medical benefit and higher concentrations will cause
severe side effects due to overdosing. Therapeutic drug monitoring
by means of point-of-care electrochemical biosensors would help the
patients to achieve this goal. However, a proper knowledge of the
drug electrochemistry is essential for development of any electrochemical
biosensor while, at the best of our knowledge, the full electrochemical
characterization of the abiraterone has not yet been published in
the literature. Therefore, the electrochemical response of abiraterone
in interaction with CYP3A4 and MWCNT is proposed in this work.

Experimental
Section
Macro screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) are purchased
from Metrohm (DRP-110). Powder of MWCNTs (diameter, 10 nm; length,
1–2 μm; 90% purity) was purchased from DropSens (Spain).
These MWCNTs were 5% functionalized with COOH to facilitate the suspension
in solvent. They were dispersed in chloroform to the concentration
of 1 mg mL–1 and were sonicated for 1 h to achieve
a stable homogeneous solution. Phosphate buffer saline (PBS; 100 mM;
pH 7.4) was provided by Sigma-Aldrich, solvated in distilled water,
and stirred to obtain the homogeneous solution. It was used as a supporting
electrolyte in all experiments. Abiraterone powder was purchased from
Medchemtronica (Stockholm, Sweden) and was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) buffer to the concentration of 10 mM to be used as a stock
solution. CYP3A4, purified and microsomal, (pureCYP3A4, micrCYP3A4)
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and was stored at −80 °C.
Microsomes contain recombinant human CYP3A4 and cytochrome P450 reductase
proteins (CYP-reductase). Enzymes were used as received.

Commercially
available SPEs were used to fabricate the biosensors. The SPEs present
carbon working electrode (WE, area 0.12 cm2), carbon counter
electrode, and silver reference electrode. Functionalization of SPEs
with MWCNTs was carried out by the drop-casting technique.3 In the drop casting procedure, 20 μL of
MWCNT dispersion (in steps of 4 μL) were dropped over the working
electrode by pipet and allowed to dry after each step. Final electrode
was stable and robust, as MWCNTs were attached over the WE by van
der Waals and hydrophobic interactions. After MWCNTs nanostructuring
(20 μg of nanomaterial), the final electroactive surface area
resulted enhanced by 4314 mm2.3,4 Nanostructured
SPEs were then stored at ambient temperature. Bare or nanostructure
carbon WE were coated by 9 μL of CYP3A4 enzymes and incubated
at +4 °C overnight to immobilize the biomolecules on the surface.
This provides specificity to the surface by adding the recognition
element of the biosensors.5 Then, the electrodes
were washed with distilled water to remove any unbound biomolecules
and further covered by PBS and stored at +4 °C for further use.
CYP450 are immobilized over the MWCNTs through physical adsorption
without altering their shape or attenuating their catalytic activity.
The main reason is that MWCNTs form a 3D porous structure over the
surface that provides a large effective surface area (compared to
a not nanostructured surface) for CYP450 protein adsorption.

An Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT128N, Metrohm, The Netherlands)
was used for cyclic voltammetry (CV) under aerobic conditions. To
acquire the CV responses (voltammograms), bioelectrodes were immersed
in a beaker containing 10 mL of buffer, gently stirred. This stirring
will help to maintain the redox environment and assures that the observed
response is due to the drug–enzyme reaction. For different
concentrations of drug, an adequate amount of abiraterone stock solution
(10 mM in DMSO buffer) was added to the beaker solution. The potential
was scanned between −0.8 V and +0.6 V vs Ag, for 10 cycles
(to obtain stable response), at a scan rate of 70 mV per second. Voltammograms
were analyzed with the Nova Software (Metrohm) for baseline correction
and removing the faradaic current from the capacitive background.
Reduction peaks were considered for investigation having performed
the acquisitions in the presence of oxygen. For data interpretation,
a suitable baseline was set for the faradaic current of the reduction
peaks. A typical voltammograms obtained in this work and the corrected
baseline is illustrated in Figure 1.

of abiraterone. Inset shows the acquired faradaic peaks after baseline
correction and capacitive current removal.

Electrochemical Results and Discussion
Electrochemical analysis
started with the identification of different peaks detected on the
voltammograms. Several different biosensors were fabricated by changing
the nanostructuring and enzyme in the biofunctionalization of SPEs,
including carbon electrode biofunctionalized with micrCYP3A4 (carbon/micrCYP3A4),
MWCNT nanostructured electrodes biofunctionalized with micrCYP3A4
(carbon/MWCNT/micrCYP3A4), MWCNT nanostructured electrodes biofunctionalized
with pureCYP3A4 (carbon/MWCNT/pureCYP3A4), and not biofunctionalized
MWCNT nanostructured electrodes (carbon/MWCNT).

Four reduction
peaks were clearly observed in the response of abiraterone and CYP3A4
interaction: they are located at −430 mV, −270 mV, −140
mV, and 61 mV. In order to identify these peaks, electrochemical responses
of different biosensors working on 900 nM drug solutions were compared
(Figure 2). These peaks
were identified by comparing the response of these different realized
biosensors with each other and with independent observation published
in the literature by other authors.6 Comparison
of behavior in the presence and absence of abiraterone is presented
in Figure 3a,b.

inset shows a complete voltammograms in buffer and after interaction
with 900 nM abiraterone (a). Averaged reduction peak of CYP3A4 at
different drug concentrations; error bars are standard error of triplicate
measurements (b).

The analysis of those
peaks shows that (A) The first peak (−430 mV) was recorded
just for biosensors with micrCYP3A4. It did not exist on voltammograms
of carbon/MWCNT, so it is related to biomolecules. Moreover, it does
not appear on voltammograms related to pureCYP3A4-based biosensors,
so it belongs to CYP-reductase molecules that coexist with CYP3A4
protein in the microsome. (B) The second peak (−270 mV) belongs
to CYP3A4 protein, also confirmed by the fact that it was observed
in the response of all CYP3A4 based biosensors. (C) The third peak
(−140 mV) appears for just the nanostructured biosensors but
not on the response of carbon/micrCYP3A4 biosensors. Therefore, it
is identified as the MWCNTs peak. (D) The fourth peak (61 mV) was
increasing over time and was stabilized with increasing the number
of cycles, so it was identified as a background peak, as also confirmed
by our group in other similar electrochemical systems.6

The inhibition of CYP3A4 by increasing the concentration
of abiraterone was observed in voltammograms acquired by carbon/MWCNT/micrCYP3A4
biosensor. The CYP3A4 faradaic peak (−270 mV) is related to
the reduction of the active site of the enzyme (heme group). This
peak would increase/decrease in the presence of a substrate/inhibitor
of the enzyme. The acquired response of biosensor to 300 nM, 600 nM,
and 900 nM abiraterone showed a gradual inhibition and suppression
of catalytic activity of CYP3A4. Reduction peaks are presented in Figure 3a, and their measured
amplitudes are presented in Figure 3b for comparison. This inhibition reaction can be explained
by the chemical structure of the drug and its interaction with enzyme
molecules on the surface.

The abiraterone structure harbors
three main features, including the aromatic nitrogen-containing heterocycle
(pyridine moiety), the hydrophobic steroidal core, and the hydroxyl
group that together ends the high affinity of the drug for irreversible
binding to cytochrome P450 enzymes.7−10 This inhibition, which is mainly due to
the complexation of the Fe2+ of the heme group of CYP3A4
and the sp2-hybridized nitrogen that exists in the pyridyl
group, is described already in the literature.9,11 However,
this is the first time that this phenomena is presented utilizing
electrochemical techniques. The redox reaction of CYP3A4 follows the
Randles-Sevcik equation that explains current depends directly on
the scan rate. The scan rate used in this work was 70 mV per second
that was optimized for MWCNTs-based biosensors elsewhere.4 Higher scan rates would increase the current
amplitude but not the sensitivity of the biosensor to various abiraterone
concentrations. At very high scan rates, current would not change
as a function of scan rate, as current could not keep up with voltage
changes.

Dose–response curve of carbon/MWCNT/micrCYP3A4
in interaction with a wide range of abiraterone concentrations was
obtained to further investigate the effect of drug on the catalytic
activity of CYP3A4 (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Dose–response curve of abiraterone in interaction with CYP3A4.
The fitting equation is indicated.

A clear inhibition of CYP3A4 was observed in the response
as diminishing its reduction peak by increasing the drug concentration.
Dose–response curve also presented two significant properties
of this reaction. First, an exponential decay of the CYP3A4 peak was
observed for drug concentrations between 0 and 1 μM. This range
completely covers the therapeutic range of the targeted drug (therapeutic
range is up to 360 nM), and this proves the capability of carbon/MWCNT/micrCYP3A4
for abiraterone concentration monitoring after proper optimization
of the sensing system. Furthermore, by increasing the concentration
from 1 μM to 3 μM, suppression of the reduction peak was
saturated that was caused by irreversible inhibition of a majority
of CYP3A4 proteins after reaction with abiraterone concentrations
beyond 1 μM.

Error bars in the figure indicate the intrasensors
variations (averaged RSD = 36%), as each data point is an average
of triplicate measurements carried out on three biosensors. The main
source of response variations is the biosensor development procedure
including nanostructuring and enzyme immobilization by van der Waals
and hydrophobic forces. This procedure helped us to avoid complexity
and focus on the behavior of the drug and the sensing surface. However,
optimization of the biosensor for abiraterone detection will be the
subject of this group’s future work. The data points follow
an exponential decay equation (eq 1), where Y0 = 8.482 μA
is the starting point, Plateau = 4.877 μA is the saturation
region, and K = 0.002263 has the reciprocal of the X-axis unit (1/nM). 1  

Electrochemical
interaction of abiraterone with MWCNT without involvement of any enzyme
caused an increment of the MWCNT peak, as is demonstrated in Figure 5. This proved the
direct electron transfer between the drug and MWCNT. In these experiments,
response of carbon/MWCNT in blank buffer and 30 μM solution
was recorded. A high drug concentration was used in this experiment
to accelerate the fouling effect and make it more observable. Then
electrodes were washed with distilled water and remeasured in blank
buffer. This procedure was repeated several times. Acquired results
(Figure 5) showed 15
μA increment of MWCNT peak after interaction with abiraterone
with respect to blank buffer. The peak was reduced for only 5 μA
in buffer after the washing while the original blank measure was 20
μA smaller. This demonstrates that the drug remained attached
to the surface of the MWCNTs after the electron exchange. Furthermore,
a stable response of ∼32 μA was observed at the second
cycle of the experiment. This shows that the surface was covered with
drug residues that prevented the signal to be increase to the previous
detected amount for drug detection and even prevented the signal to
be reduced after washing to the previous recorded amplitude in blank
buffer.

Conclusion
In
this work, the electrochemical characterization of abiraterone in
interaction with CYP3A4 enzyme and MWCNTs were investigated. Electrochemical
responses of enzymatic biosensors exhibited inhibitory effect of abiraterone
on CYP3A4 proteins. Besides, comparing the responses of various biosensors
functionalized with different nanostructures and biomolecules identified
the electrochemical peaks appeared in the responses of abiraterone:
−430 mV for CYP-reductase, −270 mV for CYP3A4, −140
mV for MWCNTs, and 61 mV as background peak. Enzymatic electrochemical
responses (Figures 3 and 4) presented an exponential decay until
1 μM that is consistent with abiraterone therapeutic range in
the human body. This inhibition behavior saturates at concentrations
around 3 μM. Complete detection of abiraterone is the subject
of this group’s future work. On the other hand, a direct electron
transfer between abiraterone molecules and MWCNTs was recorded as
well. Electrode-fouling phenomena was also observed in this direct
interaction of the drug and MWCNTs that was the result of drug molecules
attached on the surface. Therefore, abiraterone is classified as electroactive
drug molecules with electrode-fouling characteristics.
