Soils
retain lead contamination from possible sources such as mining,
smelting, battery recycling, waste incineration, leaded gasoline,
and crumbling paint. Such contamination is often concentrated in toxic
hot spots that need to be identified locally. To address this need,
a simple field procedure was designed to screen soil for hazardous
Pb for use by the general public. The procedure is a modification
of the in vitro soil Pb extraction described by Drexler
and Brattin (Hum. Ecol. Risk Assess.2007, 13, 383) and EPA Method 1340, and uses a 0.4
M glycine solution at pH 1.5. A higher soil-to-solution ratio of 1:10
allows for classifying soil samples based on extractable Pb concentrations
of <200 mg/kg (low), 200–400 mg/kg (medium), and >400
mg/kg
(high) using sodium rhodizonate as a color indicator. The 1:10 soil-to-solution
ratio also makes it possible to measure Pb concentrations in the glycine
extract solutions on a continuous scale using a portable X-ray fluorescence
analyzer. The procedure rather consistently extracts about one-third
of the Pb extracted by the standard method across a wide range of
Pb concentrations. Manufacturing the kit in larger quantities could
reduce the cost of the materials well below the current $5/test.

==== Body
Lead is known
to be highly toxic
to all organ systems and is especially harmful to cognitive development
in children.1−4 Ingesting soil contaminated with Pb is an important pathway for
child exposure,5−8 and soil remediation has been linked to decreased Pb exposure.9,10 Soils in industrial and urban areas have accumulated Pb from deteriorating
Pb-based paint, atmospheric deposition from leaded gasoline and municipal
waste incinerators, as well as past and present industrial activities
such as mining, smelting, and battery recycling.10−13

Poisoning from environmental
contamination with Pb often goes undetected
and is unevenly distributed:12,14 82% of deaths from
Pb poisoning occur in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs).11 Lead poisoning accounts for 63% of the disability-adjusted
life years (DALYs) of toxic waste sites in India, Indonesia, and the
Philippines, and contributes to a greater burden of disease than malaria
in these countries.15 Globally, the disease
burden from Pb exposure is estimated to have caused 13.9 million DALYs
in 2012 and 0.5–0.7 million deaths.16 The disease burden and loss of cognitive function due to Pb poisoning
have serious economic implications: Pb poisoning in urban Peru is
estimated to cost the country 0.5% of its GDP.17 In the U.S., each annual cohort of children born after
1980 is estimated to add $110–300 billion in economic productivity
gains due to an increase of 2–5 IQ points from reduced Pb exposure.18

Several studies have demonstrated a clear
correlation between soil-Pb
concentrations and child blood lead levels (BLL).5−7,19,20 In some cases, Pb exposure
has been correlated with the degree of urbanization because soils
retain past Pb contamination.10,21,22 Children under age 6 are the most vulnerable to Pb poisoning because
they are in a crucial neurological development phase; they are also
at higher risk for Pb exposure because they often crawl on the ground
and place dusty toys and hands into their mouth. Although U.S. child
BLLs declined by more than 90% after Pb was no longer added to gasoline
and paint, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
recognizes that “no safe Pb level has been identified.”
In 2012, the CDC replaced its BLL of concern of 10 μg/dL with
a reference level of 5 μg/dL for children.23,24 Reflecting this change, some U.S. states have updated their soil
reference level to as low as 80 mg/kg,25 but the federal soil hazard standards remain at 400 mg/kg for bare
soil where children play and 1200 mg/kg for other residential soils.26

The Pb in soil that is bioaccessible or
bioavailable provides a
better estimate of health hazard than the total Pb concentration.27In vivo bioavailability tests
require complex animal trials whereas in vitro bioaccessibility
(IVBA) tests are less expensive substitutes based on laboratory extractions
that simulate gastric conditions. Bioaccessibility methods measure
the amount of Pb released from the soil in a simulated gastric solution
and determine a relative bioavailability (RBA) that reflects the chemical
form and matrix of the soil Pb.28−30 Absolute bioavailability (ABA)
is generally defined as the fraction of ingested Pb that is absorbed
in the gastrointestinal system and enters the bloodstream. Relative
bioavailability (RBA) is the ratio of the ABA of a soil sample to
the ABA of a soluble form of Pb such as lead acetate.

There
is increased interest in developing alternative methods to
ease the determination of bioaccessible Pb.31 One challenge of the existing methods for measuring bioaccessible
Pb in soil is the need for costly laboratory equipment to process
soil samples and measure Pb concentrations in the soil extract. The
high spatial variability of total and bioaccessible Pb in soils32−36 means that many measurements are needed. Many LMICs do not have
the resources needed to identify soil Pb contamination with the same
methods used by high-income countries, nor do they conduct routine
screening of Pb in blood. A rapid and affordable field procedure could
therefore considerably reduce human exposure by identifying hot spots
of Pb contamination to avoid or address.

To the best of our
knowledge, there is no field procedure to test
for Pb in soils reliably, and no test kit for Pb in soil has been
approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).37 The commercially distributed 3M LeadCheck swabs
can only be used to test paint, which has a much higher Pb content
than even the most contaminated soils.38 The field procedure for soil presented in this study is derived
from the IVBA method of Drexler and Brattin reported in 200729 and EPA Method 1340,39 but uses a higher soil-to-solution ratio. The modification allows
the detection of elevated bioaccessible Pb concentrations with sodium
rhodizonate, the same indicator used to detect Pb in gunshot residue.40−42 The modified procedure also makes it possible to use a portable
X-ray fluorescence analyzer to measure bioaccessible Pb concentrations
in the liquid extracts on a continuous instead of a categorical scale.
Importantly, these modifications enable the procedure to be used in
the field.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
Soil Samples
All
137 soil samples were collected in
the field and passed through a kitchen sieve with a 1 mm mesh size.
The samples represent a variety of contamination types and come from
six different countries, including 65 urban soil samples from New
York City and 31 rural soil samples from Peru. The New York samples
were collected from residential backyards (n = 42),
urban farms (n = 3), and publicly accessible parks
and tree pits (n = 20). The Peruvian soil samples
were collected from small mining-impacted communities along the Carretera
Central east of Lima (n = 10), the city of Cerro
de Pasco built around a gaping open-pit mine (n =
11), and the infamous smelter town of La Oroya (n = 10). Researchers from Pure Earth (formerly Blacksmith Institute)
contributed an additional 41 soil samples from the following locations:
a secondary lead smelter in India (n = 8), a large
secondary lead smelter of lead-acid batteries in the Philippines (n = 4), an electronics-waste site in Uruguay (n = 12), and informal lead-acid battery recyclers in Indonesia (n = 10) and the Philippines (n = 7).

Instrumental Measurements
Total Pb concentrations in
soil were measured in the laboratory with a portable hand-held X-ray
fluorescence (XRF) analyzer (Innov-X Systems DELTA Premium) in a benchtop
stand. Sieved soil samples in 20 mL scintillation vials were sealed
with plastic wrap, inverted on the benchtop XRF stand, and analyzed
using the instrument’s standard soil mode for 20 s at each
of the three incident-beam energies. Soil samples were analyzed three
times, shaking the vial end over end between each analysis in an attempt
to capture soil heterogeneity. Results from XRF analysis of metals
in soils, especially Pb, have been found to highly correlate with
laboratory acid digestions,43,44 and XRF is approved
for use by EPA Test Method 6200.45

Concentrations of Pb in the field-procedure extract solutions were
also measured by XRF and confirmed in a subset by a high-resolution
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) (Thermo Scientific
Element II or PerkinElmer DRCe). For XRF analysis, 10 mL of the field-procedure
extract solution was analyzed similarly to the soil samples, by inverting
the 20 mL vial sealed with plastic wrap on the benchtop stand and
using the instrument’s soil mode for 20 s at each incident-beam
energy. For samples containing <10 mg/kg Pb in solution, the analysis
time was tripled, which lowered the detection limit calculated by
the instrument’s software from 5 to 1.5 mg/kg Pb. Concentrations
of Pb in the Drexler and Brattin (DB) extract solutions were measured
exclusively by ICP-MS, because the dilution of 1 g soil in 100 mL
solution results in concentrations below the XRF detection limit.

The XRF’s accuracy for soil Pb measurement was verified
with U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard
Reference Material (SRM) soils including SRM 2710 with 5532 mg/kg
Pb (mean 93 ± 1% SD of the reference value, n = 27), SRM 2710a with 5520 mg/kg Pb (103 ± 2% n = 3), SRM 2711 with 1162 mg/kg (98 ± 5%, n = 86), and SRM 2711a with 1400 mg/kg (104 ± 2%, n = 27). At much lower Pb concentrations, XRF readings were too high
at 128 ± 17% (n = 67) of the reference value
for SRM 2709 of 18.9 mg/kg Pb. Soil XRF Pb data were not adjusted
for this bias at low concentrations. Data for field-procedure extract
solutions measured by XRF were corrected by subtracting 3.5 mg/kg
Pb based on the repeated measurements of a blank extract solution.
For ICP-MS analysis, data were accepted when concentrations of Pb
obtained for NIST reference materials 1640A (mean recovery 104 ±
3%, n = 8) and 1643F (99 ± 4%, n = 8) were within 10% of their published values. All ICP-MS method
and vial blanks contained <1 μg/L Pb.

Field Procedure
The field procedure for assessing bioaccessible
Pb was developed by modifying various steps of the IVBA method described
by Drexler and Brattin in 2007 and used in EPA Standard Operating
Procedure (SOP) 9200.2-86 and EPA method 1340.28,29,39 Soils are sieved in
the field, if possible, and otherwise dried overnight until sieving
is achievable. For this study, three level scoops of sieved soil (0.5
mL each, approximately 1.5 g total) are weighed and added to 15 mL
of a 0.4 M glycine solution adjusted to pH 1.5 with hydrochloric acid
in a polyethylene scintillation vial with a Polyseal cone cap (Figures 1 and S1). While weighing is not required for a field
deployment, not doing so can add additional variability. The vial
is agitated for 30 s at the beginning of the extraction to ensure
that no sediment adheres to the bottom and again after 45 min to promote
mixing. To achieve a total extraction time of 1 h and to allow soil
particles to settle, the vial sits for an additional 15 min. Next,
about 10 mL of the supernatant is filtered through a 0.45 μm
disposable syringe filter into a clear vial using a syringe that fits
within the opening of the vial. A 1 cm plastic spacer is placed on
top of the vial to ensure that the tip of the syringe remains in the
supernatant and does not take up soil that could clog the filter (Figure S2). In a subset of analyses, different
amounts of soil were extracted while maintaining the same soil-to-solution
ratio (0.5 g in 5 mL for 12 samples in 2014 and 1 g in 10 mL for 50
samples in 2015).

Figure 1 Schematic of the field procedure steps and a decision
tree for
the color ranking. A more detailed visual instruction sheet as given
to those using the procedure in pilot studies can be found in Figure S1.

Color Indicator
After filtration of the extract, a
dissolvable gelatin capsule containing 10 mg of sodium rhodizonate
is added to the vial. Sodium rhodizonate forms a purple precipitate
with Pb, as described by Feigl and Suter (1942), and is still used
today in forensic applications to identify lead gunshot residue.41,42 The intensity of the violet-purple color for each sample was ranked
by two researchers independently as low, medium, or high after 5 min,
based on the color chart (Figure 1). All vials had tape over the labels and were randomly
ordered to ensure an unbiased reading.

All samples that were
clearly purple were ranked high, and all samples that were orange,
yellow, clear, or red were ranked low. Samples that were brown, gray,
blue, or appeared darker but not purple were ranked medium. In addition,
one researcher ranked the color after 1 h, based on photos that were
taken during the procedure. One researcher also ranked the actual
vials after 24 h based on the amount of precipitate that was visible
on the bottom of the vial. Samples were ranked highest if the precipitate
covered the vial bottom and ranked high if any precipitate was visible.
If no precipitate was visible, the sample was ranked low. Samples
were ranked medium if the precipitate was barely visible, often appearing
like a wisp of smoke in the solution.

Standard Bioaccessible
Pb Method
For comparison, bioaccessible
Pb was determined in a subset of 50 soil samples and two NIST soil
standards following the standard Drexler and Brattin (DB)29 method and EPA Method 134039 by extracting 1 g of dried soil <250 μm in 100
mL of 0.4 M glycine adjusted to pH 1.5 at 37 °C for 1 h. We used
an incubator with a shaker table at 37 °C and 30 rpm, instead
of the prescribed end-over-end rotator in a water bath; samples were
turned end over end every 10 min by hand to simulate the end-over-end
rotator. The pH was measured at the end of the extraction to confirm
that it remained within 0.5 units of 1.5. The DB method establishes
IVBA and can be used to estimate RBA by calculating RBA = 0.8782 ×
IVBA – 0.028.28,29 The EPA Method 1340 was updated
in 2017 to use soil sieved to <150 μm; however, the majority
of our field and lab work was conducted prior to this EPA update and
followed the previous method. Recoveries were within the expected
range for NIST 2710a (96%, n = 1), NIST 2711a (115%, n = 1), a duplicate (98% recovery, n =
1), and a matrix spike (92% recovery, n = 1). For
a subset of 13 samples contaminated by different industries analyzed
in 2014, a 1:100 soil-to-solution ratio was maintained by using 0.2
g soil in 20 mL glycine solution, instead of the standard 1 g in 100
mL, and a hot water bath on a shaker table was used instead of the
incubator.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical
analyses were performed
with R Studio 1.0.136 using R 3.2.3 (R Core Team 2015) to assess the
difference between (a) the XRF and ICPMS Pb results for extracts and
(b) the field procedure extracts and the DB IVBA extracts. Since the
data are not normally distributed, we used a Spearman rank correlation
coefficient. Correlation between data sets were considered not statistically
significant if p > 0.05.

Results
XRF Analysis
of Field Procedure Extracts
A total of
114 liquid samples were analyzed by both ICP-MS and XRF, including
five Pb solution standards and the field-procedure extracts from a
subset of 107 soil samples and two NIST soil standards. Concentrations
of Pb determined by XRF after blank correction were consistent with
ICP-MS analyses across a range from <0.1 to 930 mg/L (Spearman’s rs = 0.99, p < 0.001). The
XRF analyzer overestimates Pb concentrations in the glycine solution
by about 16% (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Blank-corrected XRF vs ICP-MS measurements of dissolved Pb (mg/kg)
in solution for the field-procedure extracts of 107 soil samples and
two NIST soil standards, as well-dissolved Pb standards. XRF and ICP-MS
error bars are 10%. Samples with <10 mg/kg Pb by XRF were analyzed
again tripling the analysis time per beam energy. One non-detect sample
by XRF is plotted at 1.2 mg/kg, half the instrument’s estimated
detection limit. Different types of contamination are shown in the
legend.

Field Procedure Extracts
The concentrations of Pb extracted
by the field procedure and the original DB method for 52 soil samples
are well correlated (Spearman’s rs = 0.92, p < 0.001) (Figure 3). Across the range of concentrations and
contamination types, the field procedure extracted about one-third
as much Pb (mean 37 ± 15% SD, range 4–73%). The three
soil samples from a smelter in India are outliers for which the field
procedure extracted 70% of the Pb extracted by DB method (Table 1). The amount of Pb
extracted was corrected for the dilution of the soil into solution
by weighing the soil for both methods. However, no large difference
is seen in the best-fit line across the subset of samples that contained
both soil weight and scoop volume (Figure S4).

Figure 3 Amount of Pb extracted by the field procedure
and the original
Drexler and Brattin (DB) method for n = 52 soil samples
(including two NIST standards) after accounting for soil-to-solution
dilution. Extracted Pb was analyzed by ICP-MS and error bars are 10%.
Samples from large secondary smelters, battery recycling, and e-waste
were analyzed by the early procedure, which maintained the 1:10 and
1:100 soil-to-solution ratios but used less soil. For the 1:10 field-procedure
method 1 g of soil was added to 10 mL of a glycine solution, and for
the 1:100 DB Pb method 0.2 g of soil was added to 20 mL of a glycine
solution. Symbols indicating contamination type are the same as in Figure 2.

Total soil-Pb concentrations in the 137 soil samples
from different
countries and two NIST soil standards measured by XRF ranged from
40 to 100 000 mg/kg (Figure 4). The field procedure extracted
between 12 and 10 700 mg/kg Pb from these same samples. Thirty-one
solutions from the field procedure were checked by a pH test strip,
of which 28 confirmed the pH remained below pH = 2, and three indicated
the pH was between 2 and 3. The field procedure extracted the highest
proportion of Pb from soils around large secondary smelters, followed
by soil near used lead-acid battery recyclers, e-waste sites, NYC
urban areas, a primary ore smelter, and mining areas (Table 1).

Figure 4 Concentration of Pb extracted
by the field procedure for 139 soil
samples of varying contamination types (symbols as in Figure 2). Total Pb in soil was analyzed
by XRF and error bars are the standard deviation of three measurements.
Extracted Pb was analyzed by XRF and blank and slope corrected based
on the equation in Figure 2; also shown are 10% error bars.

Color Readings
Lead concentrations in 79 field procedure
extracts (65 urban soil samples from New York City and 10 mining-impacted
soils from Peru) were ranked as high/medium/low based on the intensity
of the purple color after 5 min and the amount of precipitate after
24 h (Figure 5). After
5 min, all 23 samples that ranked high extracted more than 200 mg/kg
Pb, and all 38 samples that ranked low extracted less than 220 mg/kg
Pb. The detection limit is reduced after 1 h, as 33 samples ranked
high and all had extracted more than 150 mg/kg Pb (SI Figure S3). Of the 34 samples ranked low, 31 extracted
less than 150 mg/kg Pb. Assessing the amount of precipitate formed
after 24 h further reduced the detection limit: all 38 samples that
ranked high extracted more than 150 mg/kg Pb, and all 29 samples that
ranked low extracted less than 140 mg/kg Pb.

Figure 5 Ranking of field procedure
extracts by extractable Pb concentration
(dissolved Pb measured by ICPMS and multiplied by dilution factor)
after (a) 5 min based on color and (b) 24 h based on precipitate amount.
Rankings are compared to EPA soil screening levels of total Pb converted
to the amount of Pb extracted by the field procedure based on 71.5%
IVBA and the equation in Figure 3 (400 to >190 and 1200 to >387 mg/kg Pb).

To compare the amount of Pb extracted
by the field procedure to
EPA soil standards, federal total Pb soil screening levels were converted
to bioaccessible Pb concentrations, where IVBAEPA = (0.6
+ 0.028)/0.8782 = 71.5%, with the EPA’s assumption of 60% (0.6)
RBA (or 30% ABA).28,39 At 71.5% IVBA, the EPA soil screening
levels of 400 and 1200 mg/kg total Pb convert to 286 and 858 mg/kg
Pb extracted by the DB IVBA method. These levels were then converted
to the Pb that field procedure would extract by using equation from Figure 3, resulting in 190
and 387 mg/kg Pb, respectively.

Comparing the visual color rankings
to these reference levels,
we see that after 5 min, samples that extracted more than 387 mg/kg
Pb ranked either medium (n = 2) or high (n = 18), while samples that extracted less than 190 mg/kg
Pb ranked either low (n = 36) or medium (n = 2) (Figure 5). After 24 h, all samples extracting more than 387 mg/kg
Pb ranked high (n = 20). Of the 38 samples extracting
<190 mg/kg Pb, a larger fraction ranked medium (n = 8) and high (n = 1) due to the lower detection
limit.

Discussion
Trade-Offs between Field
and Laboratory Testing
The
field procedure and the DB method produced remarkably consistent results
even if only about one-third as much Pb was extracted by the field
procedure (Figure 3, Table 1). Likely
reasons that the field procedure releases a lower fraction of total
Pb include the following: larger particle size (∼1 mm instead
of <250 or 150 μm), re-adsorption due to the higher soil-to-solution
ratio (1:10 vs 1:100), lower extraction temperature (22 to 37 °C),
and possibly less frequent shaking. Reducing the soil-to-solution
ratio from 1:100 to 1:10 is crucial, however, for reaching a Pb concentration
in solution that is high enough to (a) form a color precipitate with
sodium rhodizonate and (b) analyze the extract solution by XRF. It
would be impractical for a wide group of users in the field to follow
the DB method, which stipulates sieving soil to <250 μm,
or the updated EPA 1340 method, which sieves soil to <150 μm.
Similarly, using ambient temperature (10–30 °C) instead
of an incubator set to 37 °C is a requirement for adapting the
method for use in the field. Another simplification is that the field
procedure relies on a volumetric method, a small scoop, to measure
the amount of soil added to glycine solution. The density of soil
can vary widely, however; the mass of three scoops of dried soil analyzed
for this study ranged from 0.5 to 2.8 g (mean = 1.6 ± 0.4 g SD).
However, across the subset of samples that contained both soil weight
and scoop volume (Figure S4), the field-procedure
still extracted a similar proportion of Pb. When increased accuracy
can be obtained with an XRF analyzer, bringing a portable balance
to the field for maintaining a more consistent soil mass could be
justified. Finally, although the pH did not increase much in these
samples, a pH test is also recommended to confirm that the pH of the
field-procedure extract remains around or below 2, especially when
testing soils with a high pH buffering capacity. Site-specific confirmation
of pH stability and average scoop mass could be a simple way to increase
accuracy without measuring these parameters on all samples.

Results from the simplified field procedure admittedly may be less
directly relatable to child exposure, or at least the relationship
established between absorption of Pb in juvenile swine and the DB
procedure. Larger particles, for instance, are less likely to stick
to hands and be ingested. Such limitations are more than compensated,
in our opinion, by the benefit of providing concerned parents or community
members with the means of testing soil wherever a child is likely
to play. Furthermore, the field procedure outlined here still manages
to give a reasonable estimate of bioaccessible Pb in soils, which
may be a better measure of actual health risk from Pb in soil than
total Pb measured by XRF in bulk soil. The current thresholds of <200,
200–400, and >400 mg/kg extractable Pb in soil could be
adjusted
if needed by varying the amount of soil added to the extraction solution.
However, these values do not differ greatly from the calculated 190
mg/kg and 387 mg/kg field-procedure extractable Pb that correspond
to the current EPA screening levels of 400 and 1200 mg/kg total soil
Pb.

The field procedure estimates bioaccessible Pb by measuring
the
concentration of Pb released into the extract, which is directly related
to health risk. Results from the field procedure are therefore sufficient
to start prioritizing and addressing the most hazardous areas. Since
soil contamination is often very spatially heterogeneous, once the
location of Pb hotspots is known, individuals and communities can
avoid these areas and take additional actions to reduce exposure.
Possible actions include covering the area with clean soil or another
barrier, ensuring children do not play in the high-Pb area, ensuring
high-Pb soil is not transported out of the area or into homes, and
maintaining clean environments with low dust and dirt levels where
children play and eat.10,46

Extension of the Method
In addition to identifying
areas of hazardous Pb in soil with the colorimetric method, the field
procedure could be used to estimate IVBA as described by Drexler and
Brattin in 2007 and EPA Method 134039 by
measuring the Pb in the field-procedure extract solution by XRF or
ICP-MS and estimating the Pb extracted by the DB method by PbDB = (Pbfield_procedure – 89)/0.34 (Figure 3) and applying corrections
to the XRF readings if needed (Figure 2). One could consider developing a site-specific or
updated relationship, especially if samples are from soils near large
secondary smelters or unknown types of contaminations (Table 1).

Pairing the field-procedure
extraction with an XRF in the field could also help select samples
for more detailed laboratory analysis. In situations where laboratory
analysis is not planned or available, local health departments or
technicians with access to a portable hand-held XRF analyzer could
still assess the health risk of soil Pb contamination more accurately
by applying the field procedure than by only measuring total soil-Pb
concentrations. One would need to measure the total Pb concentration
in the soil in order to determine the proportion of soil Pb that is
bioaccessible.

Potential Color Interference
Our
observations show
that in addition to analyzing the color at 5 min, waiting for 24 h
to assess the amount of precipitate amount enables us to confirm the
presence of Pb and lowers the detection limit. When glycine extracts
turn brown, blue, or gray instead of purple, they should be categorized
as medium and analyzed for the presence of precipitate after 24 h.
While the use of sodium rhodizonate to detect Pb has been well documented,
Feigl and Suter (1942) pointed out that complexes are formed with
other cations including zinc (brown-violet), tin (violet), strontium
(red-brown), barium (red-brown), cadmium (brown-red), mercury (brown-red),
bismuth (red-brown), calcium (red-brown), and iron (blue). We tested
the following solutions for potential interference: zinc (30 mg/kg
and 1000 m/kg), barium (30 mg/kg), copper (30 mg/kg), calcium (30
mg/kg), and iron (30 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg), created from high-purity
standards in 1–2% nitric acid for ICP-MS. Only iron solutions
resulted in a potentially interfering dark solution, although this
solution was dark blue and not purple; all other solutions remained
light yellow in color. To further check for the likelihood of these
interferences in our soil extracts, we examined elemental concentrations
of these elements in the extract solutions. Besides Pb, the only element
detected by XRF that was significantly correlated with the color ranking
of our samples was zinc. Extract solutions from two Peruvian mining
samples contained 2700 and 1500 mg/kg Zn; all other samples contained
<300 mg/kg Zn. While the two samples with >1500 mg/kg Zn were
a
darker, brown color at 5 min, the presence or absence of a precipitate
after 24 h accurately indicated the level of Pb. The Zn standard of
1000 mg/kg had not changed color. The Fe standard of
30 mg/kg turned blue; however, all our extracts contained Fe below
the XRF detection limit of 15–20 mg/kg.

Conclusion
Screening soils for Pb is not common in residential areas and urban
gardens, neither in the U.S. nor internationally, although the negative
health impacts of Pb are well established and many studies have shown
elevated Pb levels in soils, often due to historical contamination.
As studies continue to confirm negative health impacts at lower Pb
exposures in children and cardiovascular impacts later in adults,4,23 testing soil for Pb is likely to receive more attention, especially
in urban and previously industrial areas. The cost of materials and
supplies per analysis of the current procedure is around US$5/sample.
This could be reduced significantly if a kit derived from the procedure
is produced in large quantities. Due to its modest cost and simplicity,
the field procedure is well suited for deployment by local health
departments, citizen scientists, concerned parents, or community groups
without access to a laboratory.
