Flow cytometry is a ubiquitous, multiparametric
method for characterizing
cellular populations. However, this method can grow increasingly complex
with the number of proteins that need to be screened simultaneously:
spectral emission overlap of fluorophores and the subsequent need
for compensation, lengthy sample preparation, and multiple control
tests that need to be performed separately must all be considered.
These factors lead to increased costs, and consequently, flow cytometry
is performed in core facilities with a dedicated technician operating
the instrument. Here, we describe a low-cost, label-free microfluidic
method that can determine the phenotypic profiles of single cells.
Our method employs Node-Pore Sensing to measure the transit times
of cells as they interact with a series of different antibodies, each
corresponding to a specific cell-surface antigen, that have been functionalized
in a single microfluidic channel. We demonstrate the capabilities
of our method not only by screening two acute promyelocytic leukemia
human cells lines (NB4 and AP-1060) for myeloid antigens, CD13, CD14,
CD15, and CD33, simultaneously, but also by distinguishing a mixture
of cells of similar size—AP-1060 and NALM-1—based on
surface markers CD13 and HLA-DR. Furthermore, we show that our method
can screen complex subpopulations in clinical samples: we successfully
identified the blast population in primary human bone marrow samples
from patients with acute myeloid leukemia and screened these cells
for CD13, CD34, and HLA-DR. We show that our label-free method is
an affordable, highly sensitive, and user-friendly technology that
has the potential to transform cellular screening at the benchside.

==== Body
Flow cytometry
(FCM) is one
of the cornerstones of biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.
With its ability to screen individual cells for multiple protein epitopes
simultaneously and subsequently identify subpopulations of cells,
FCM has had a profound impact in a broad range of areas including
immunology,1−3 cancer,4,5 and regenerative medicine.6,7 Recent advances in both fluorochrome and laser technologies have
dramatically increased the number of proteins that can be screened
simultaneously—from 2 to the current state-of-the-art of 208,9—further advancing these fields. Despite this tremendous increased
capability, “multi-color” FCM can be difficult to implement
given that spectral emission overlap significantly increases with
the number of fluorochromes utilized simultaneously, and highly complex
analysis is necessary to decouple such overlap.3,9 Additional
challenges include the following: the high cost per assay to the user,
lengthy sample preparation steps, and multiple control tests that
need to be performed separately. Furthermore, because of its overall
complexity, the need for frequent calibration, and high cost as an
instrument, multicolor FCM is often located in a central facility
and operated by a skilled technician.

Most recently, mass cytometry,
or CyTOF, which combines FCM with
mass spectrometry and can screen more than 70 parameters simultaneously,
has been introduced.3,9 Although it is a paradigm-shifting
technique, CyTOF does have one distinct disadvantage: cells are vaporized
and are therefore not available for collection for secondary analysis
or culture. Numerous “lab-on-a-chip” technologies for
cell screening have also been introduced. Examples include the true
miniaturization of fluorescence-activated cell sorting10−12 and dielectrophoretic or impedance cell characterization.13−17 Although successful in targeted applications, these on-chip technologies
have a number of distinct disadvantages, ranging from the need for
exogenous labeling with fluorophores or magnetic beads, to the limited
parameters that can be screened because the hardware is not yet as
sophisticated as that in FCM, to the inability to distinguish cellular
subpopulations with similar morphologies or physical properties (e.g.,
dielectric constants, cell size, etc.).

Here, we describe a
unique label-free, microfluidic method that
employs Node-Pore Sensing (NPS)18 to screen
single cells for both size and multiple cell-surface epitopes, simultaneously.
NPS is based on measuring the current pulse caused by a cell transiting
a microchannel that has been segmented by a series of inserted nodes
(Figure 1). Like resistive-pulse sensing (RPS),19−22 i.e., the Coulter-counter principle,23 the magnitude of the current pulse corresponds to cell size; however,
unlike RPS, the current pulse in NPS is modulated, reflecting both
the number and spacing of the nodes in the channel.18 When the individual segments between the nodes are functionalized
with different antibodies corresponding to distinct cell-surface antigens,
cells whose antigens can interact specifically with the functionalized
antibodies in a particular segment will travel more slowly through
that section of the channel than through the isotype-control segment.
Surface-marker identification, and ultimately phenotypic profiling,
is thus accomplished by comparing transit times within the modulated
pulse. Unlabeled cells remain viable and are available for downstream
analysis and/or culturing post screening. We demonstrate the versatility
of NPS by successfully screening cells from established human cell
lines for their specific phenotypic profiles and by distinguishing
cell types in a mixed population based on surface-marker profiles.
Moreover, we demonstrate the potential clinical value of NPS by immunophenotyping
primary human bone marrow samples from acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
patients. Overall, we show that NPS goes beyond current screening
methods in terms of simplicity and flexibility, cost, and user friendliness.

For the schematic shown, the cell expresses two markers that specifically
interact with Antibodies 1 and 3, leading to longer transit-times,
τAb1 and τAb3, in these segments
as compared to the transit-times, τAb2, τAb4, and τAb5, recorded when the cell traverses
through the other segments of the node-pore.

Experimental Section
Basic Fabrication of the Node-Pore Platform
Our multimarker
screening method is based on performing NPS with a single channel
that has been segmented by a series of nodes of larger area (hereafter
known as a “node-pore”) (Figure 1). We first utilize standard microfabrication techniques to fabricate
on a glass substrate the planar electrodes that enable a four-terminal
measurement of the current across the entire node-pore (Figure 1A). Next, we employ soft lithography to create a
set of temporary channels whose individual widths are the same size
as the segment lengths between the nodes. We align these channels
transverse to the direction of the eventual node-pore to thus functionalize
each segment between the nodes with a saturating concentration of
either a specific antibody corresponding to a particular cell-surface
antigen or an isotype-control antibody (Figures 1B,C). We also utilize soft lithography to create the node-pore itself,
which we subsequently align on top of, and clamp to, the prepared
substrate (Figures 1D,E). For the experiments
described here, we utilized either a four-node or five-node device
(each device was 18 μm × 18 μm (H × W) with
1150 μm long segments separated by 58 μm wide and 50 μm
long nodes). In-plane filters24−26 are included to remove cellular
debris and clusters that may clog the device. The flexibility and
ease of device design and fabrication allow one to create devices
with larger channels in terms of height and width, and more importantly,
devices with many more nodes, corresponding to a greater number of
surface antigens that could be screened, simultaneously. See Supporting Information (SI) for full details
on device preparation.

Data Acquisition and Analysis
For
the experiment, ∼1
× 106 cells/mL cells were injected into a prepared
node-pore device, and a nonpulsatile pressure (0.07–17.20 kPa)
was used to drive the cells through the device. As single cells transited
through the device, a four-point terminal measurement of the current
across the node-pores was performed using a constant applied DC voltage,
as previously published.18,25,26 The measured current was passed through a preamplifier (DL Instrument
1211) before entering a data acquisition board (National Instruments
PCI-6035E) for analysis in LabVIEW.

Cell Culture
NB4
cells were cultured at 2 × 106 cells/mL in RPMI 1640
media supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine
Serum (FBS) and 1× penicillin/streptomycin and routinely passaged
as described by Lanotte et al.27 AP-1060
cells, obtained from Dr. S. Kogan, University of California-San Francisco,
San Francisco, CA, U.S.A., were cultured at 1 × 106 cells/mL in 70% Iscove’s MDM supplemented with 20% FBS, 1×
penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% conditioned medium from A5637 cells
(ATTC) cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1×
penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were routinely passaged as described
by Sun et al.28 NALM-1 cells (ATCC) were
cultured at 1 × 106 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 15% FBS and 1× penicillin/streptomycin and routinely passaged
as described by Minowada et al.29 For the
screening experiments described, NB4, AP-1060, and NALM-1 cells were
sedimented and resuspended at a concentration of ∼1 ×
106 cells/mL in their respective (fresh) media prior to
being injected into the node-pore device. For mixed sample testing,
the samples were resuspended in a 1:1 mixture of each cell-line media.

Primary Human Bone Marrow Samples
Primary bone marrow
samples were obtained from patients with AML after obtaining written
informed consent to an IRB-approved protocol at The University of
Chicago, which allows for the use of AML samples for future scientific
research. Bone marrow samples were processed using a standard red-blood
cell lysis protocol, frozen viably with 10% DMSO, and stored in liquid
nitrogen. For screening, samples were thawed, suspended in prewarmed
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1× penicillin/streptomycin,
and spun at 300g for 3 min. Cells were then resuspended
in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS and immediately screened
with NPS. All sample screening was performed under a University of
California, Berkeley IRB-approved protocol.

Results and Discussion
Operation
of the Node-Pore Sensing Platform
As it enters
the node-pore, a cell partially blocks the flow of current leading
to an initial decrease in current across the node-pore (Figure 1F). The magnitude of the current drop corresponds
to the size of the cell (see SI). When
the cell enters a node, the current rises, reflecting the fact that
the current density of the node, Jnode, is less than that of the channel, Jchannel. The current again decreases when the
cell exits the node and enters another segment of the node-pore. Finally,
as the cell exits the node-pore, the current once again returns to
its baseline value. The continual rise and fall of current as a cell
passes through the different nodes and segments of the node-pore is
a hallmark of NPS18 and leads to current
pulses that have (N + 1) distinct subpulses corresponding
to N nodes in the channel. If a cell expresses a
surface antigen that can interact specifically with the functionalized
antibody in a particular segment of a node-pore with evenly spaced
nodes, transient interactions will retard the cell as it transits
through that segment, resulting in a longer subpulse duration as compared
to that recorded when the cell transits the isotype-control segment
(Figure 1F). Antibody arrangement or placement
of the isotype-control segment does not influence transit-times, as
a cell slows down significantly in the nodes between every measurement
region (see Figure S-10 and SI). By functionalizing
each segment of a node-pore with a different antibody that corresponds
to a different cell-surface marker and by comparing the duration of
the subpulses to that of the isotype control, we achieve label-free
multimarker screening.

Simultaneous Screening of Single Cells for
Four Surface Markers
We screened cells from two different
human acute promyelocytic
leukemia cell lines, NB4 and AP-1060. NB4 cells were established from
a patient who was resistant to all-trans-retinoic
acid (ATRA),27 and AP-1060 cells were derived
from a patient who was resistant to both ATRA and arsenic trioxide
(ATO).28 Although CD13 and CD33 are expressed
in the majority of NB4 and AP-1060 cells, CD14 expression is absent.27,28 Moreover, CD15 is expressed moderately in NB4 cells and only weakly
in AP-1060 cells.27,28 Figure 2A shows a schematic of the functionalized four-node devices we employed
to screen NB4 and AP-1060 cells for these particular markers.

Figure 2 Surface-marker
profiling of leukemia cells using NPS. Acute Promyelocytic
Leukemia (APL) human cell lines, NB4 and AP-1060, were screened for
CD13, CD14, CD15, and CD33, simultaneously. (A) Schematic of the utilized
node-pore device, which was functionalized with four specific antibodies
(anti-CD13 Ab, anti-CD14 Ab, anti-CD15 Ab, and anti-CD33 Ab, all at
a saturating concentration of 1 mg/mL) and an isotype control antibody
(IgG1, 1 mg/mL). The device was 18 μm × 18 μm (H
× W) with five 1150 μm long segments separated by four
nodes, each 58 μm wide and 50 μm long. (B) Representative
current pulses caused by NB4 cells (top, middle) and an AP-1060 cell
(bottom) transiting the node-pore device. The modulated pulses are
due to each cell traveling through each segment of the node-pore.
The width of each subpulse, indicated as τCD13, τCD14, τCD15, τCD33, and τIgG1, corresponds to the transit-time of each cell as it traverses
each segment. Scale bar, 0.25 s. (C) Representative normalized transit-times
(τnorm = τspecific/τIgG1) of 10 NB4 cells and 10 AP-1060 cells and the resulting distribution
for each marker screened. A cell is positive for a particular marker
(CD13 = yellow; CD14 = red; CD15 = blue; and CD33 = pink) if τnorm is greater than a threshold cutoff (denoted as a dashed
green line and defined as 1+ 2σisotype, where σisotype describes the inherent variability in nonspecific interactions
between the cells and the functionalized isotype antibodies (see SI)). Thus, NB4 Cell 1 is CD13+/CD14–/CD15+/CD33+, and AP1060 Cell
3 is CD13+/CD14–/CD15–/CD33+. A summary of cells positive/negative for each
marker is shown in the normalized transit-time distribution. A total
of 65 NB4 cells and 127 AP-1060 cells were measured. (D) FCM analysis
of cells from the same population of NB4 and AP-1060 cells measured
with the node-pore device. FCM detailed data can be found in SI, Figures S-2 and S-3. 15 000 NB4 cells
and 35 000 AP-1060 cells were screened. A χ2 analysis with a p-value = 0.05 shows that with
exception to the AP-1060 CD14 and CD33 results, the two methods are
statistically equivalent. See text for details.

Figure 2B shows representative current
versus
time pulses that were produced when single cells traversed the prepared
node-pore. The pulses are clearly modulated, each consisting of five
subpulses corresponding to a cell transiting the five different segments
of the node-pore. The transit-time of each subpulse is as indicated:
τCD13, τCD14, τCD15, τCD33, and τIgG1. To determine
whether a cell has interacted specifically with one of the functionalized
segments, we normalized the cell’s transit-time in that particular
segment, τspecific, with respect to its transit-time
through the isotype control, τnorm = τspecific/τisotype. To account for the inherent
variability in nonspecific interactions between cells and the functionalized
isotype antibodies, we conservatively defined positive expression
of an antigen if τnorm > 1 + 2σisotype. Here, σisotype is the standard deviation of the
normalized transit-time values we measured when we screened a sample
of cells with a node-pore consisting of only multiple isotype-control
segments (see SI). Figure 2C shows the phenotypic profiles of 10 individual NB4 and AP-1060
cells. Each dashed box corresponds to a single cell and contains the
normalized transit-times corresponding to the markers screened (τCD13, norm = orange, τCD14, norm = red, τCD15, norm = blue, τCD33, norm = pink). The dashed green line corresponds to the cutoff value,
1 + 2σisotype. Thus, NB4 Cell 1 is CD13+/CD14–/CD15+/CD33+, and Cell
10 is CD13+/CD14–/CD15–/CD33+. Likewise, AP-1060 Cell 2 is CD13+/CD14–/CD15–/CD33+, and Cell
7 is CD13–/CD14–/CD15–/CD33+. The normalized transit-time distributions for
all cells measured for each marker screened are also shown in Figure 2C. The range of normalized transit-times in each
distribution is due to cells having different expression levels of
a particular surface marker: as we have shown previously,25,26 cells with higher expression levels will have a greater number of
interactions with the functionalized antibodies and in turn longer
transit-times as compared to those cells with lower expression levels.
With NPS, we found that most NB4 cells express CD13 and CD33 (92%
and 83%, respectively), whereas only some express CD15 (45%), and
very few express CD14 (5%). Similarly, we found that most AP-1060
cells express CD13 and CD33 (86% and 76%, respectively), far less
express CD15 (21%), and very few express CD14 (3%). To validate our
results, we performed FCM on samples of cells taken from the same
populations screened with the node-pores (Figure 2D). By employing a χ2 test with a p-value = 0.05 (SI), we found
that, with the exception of our AP-1060 CD14 and CD33 results, there
were no statistically significant differences between the results
obtained from NPS and those of FCM. Minor discrepancies may be due
to the small sample sizes NPS screened (less than 150 cells versus
greater than 15 000 cells for FCM), and/or to the fact that
some cells did not have a sufficient number of transient interactions
to lead to a detectable transit-time delay in NPS. For CD14, the large
χ2 value was not due to a low-detection sensitivity
of NPS; rather, it was a result of the fact that only a small number
of cells were expected to express this marker. In other words, even
minor differences in detection (3% in NPS vs 1% in FCM) would lead
to a greatly exaggerated χ2 value (SI). The larger discrepancy with CD33 may be due to weak transient
interaction between antibody and antigen in the node-pore versus the
permanent binding between the two that occurs during incubation for
FCM. As we show below, by incorporating redundancy (i.e., multiple segments functionalized with the same antibody in
our device), we can easily overcome this particular limitation in
NPS.

Differentiating Mixed Populations and Including Redundancy for
Higher Sensitivity in the Node-Pore
We screened a 1:1 mixture
of AP-1060 cells and NALM-1 cells for HLA-DR and CD13 using a node-pore
that consisted of repeated segments of the same set of antibodies
(i.e., anti-HLA-DR antibody and anti-CD13 antibody) (Figure 3B). NALM-1 cells, established from a patient with
chronic myeloid leukemia who was in lymphoid blast crisis,29 are similar in size to AP-1060 cells. However,
although AP-1060 cells are HLA-DR-/CD13+,28 NALM-1 cells are HLA-DR+/CD13–.30 We chose to employ a redundant-patterned
node-pore to increase our screening method’s sensitivity. Using
two segments functionalized with the same antibody, we increased the
probability of transient interactions that could occur between the
cell-surface antigen and that particular antibody.

Figure 3 Analysis of a 1:1 mixture
of AP-1060: NALM-1 cells using a 4-node-pore
device (of similar dimension as that in Figure 2) that has repeated regions of antibody functionalization. AP-1060
cells are HLA-DR–/CD13+, while NALM-1
cells are HLA-DR+/CD13–. (A) FCM analysis
of the cell mixture confirmed the nearly 1:1 mixture of cells. FCM
details can be found in SI, Figure S-4.
(B) Schematic of the 4-node-pore device employed. The repeated patterning
of the anti-HLA-DR Ab and anti-CD13 Ab combination on either side
of the patterned IgG1 was included to increase the sensitivity of
screening. All regions were functionalized with 1 mg/mL of antibodies.
HLA-DR 1 (region 1) = blue; CD13 1 (region 2) = red, HLA-DR 2 (region
4) = light blue; and CD13 2 (region 5) = pink). (C) Representative
normalized transit-time of 10 cells from the mixed sample. As in Figure 2, a cell is determined to be positive for a surface
marker if its normalized transit-time is greater than the IgG1 threshold
cutoff, which is indicated as a green dashed line (see SI). Although it is HLA-DR–/CD13– in the first half of the device, Cell 1
is HLA-DR+/CD13– in the second half.
We consider the cell to be overall HLA-DR+/CD13–. (D) Normalized transit-time distribution of each functionalized
segment. A total of 41 cells were measured. By considering those cells
like Cell 1, whose normalized transit-time is above the threshold
cutoff in at least one of the two similarly functionalized segments
as positive for a particular surface marker, the sensitivity of the
overall device is greatly increased. A χ2 analysis
with a p-value = 0.05 shows that there were no statistically
significant differences between the results obtained with NPS and
FCM (see SI).

The normalized transit-times of representative cells from
the screened
mixture are shown in Figure 3C. Using the same
analysis as before, where positive expression for a marker corresponds
to τnorm > 1 + 2σisotype, we
found
that in the first half of the device, 39% of the cells were NALM-1,
and 44% were AP-1060. In contrast, in the second half of the device,
only 32% of the cells were NALM-1, and 41% were AP-1060 (Figure 3D). The different percentages obtained by the two
different halves of the device highlight the fact that some cells
may not have had sufficient transient interactions to lead to a measurable
change in transit-time in a particular functionalized segment. By
considering cells as positive for a particular marker if they screened
positive in at least one section, we greatly increase the sensitivity
and accuracy of our screening method: 41% are thus NALM-1, and 49%
are AP-1060. These results are virtually identical to those we obtained
by performing FCM on the same population of cells (Figure 3A), and a χ2 test with a p-value = 0.05 confirmed this (SI). Moreover, they showcase our method’s ability to distinguish
two different subpopulations accurately in a sample.

Screening Primary
Human Bone Marrow Samples from Patients with
AML
To demonstrate that NPS could go well beyond screening
cell lines and analyze complex cellular subpopulations typically found
in patient samples, we screened previously frozen bone-marrow samples
from three different AML patients and characterized the blast populations
therein. We employed a five-node device to measure expression of CD13,
HLA-DR, CD34, and CD45, as shown in Figure 4A. Because the process of freezing and subsequent thawing of primary
cells could potentially alter surface-marker expression, we also performed
FCM on these samples for comparison.

Figure 4 FCM and NPS analysis of AML patient bone-marrow
samples. (A) The
antibody pattern configuration for the five-node-pore used to screen
the AML patient bone-marrow samples. Two different isotype-controls,
IgG1 and IgG2, were included because of the specific antibodies chosen.
(B) NPS cell-size distribution (left) and surface-marker normalized
transit-time distributions (right) for each patient sample. Cells
greater than 12 μm (dark purple in the cell-size distribution)
were considered to be blasts, and the percentage of the blast population
is as indicated. (C) FCM analysis of the patient samples. FCM detailed
data can be found in SI, Figures S-7–S-9. FCM analyzed ∼4000, 5000, and 9000 cells for Patient 1,
2, and 3, respectively. As with the statistical analysis performed
previously (Figures 2 and 3), a χ2 analysis with a p-value = 0.05 shows that, with the exception of Patient 2’s
CD34 expression, there are no statistically significant differences
between NPS and FCM. See text for a full detailed description.

Blast cells are large, typically
12–20 μm,31 and have low expression
of CD45. Although FCM
employs side-scatter (SS)/CD45 expression to identify the blast-cell
population,32,33 we use cell size and consider
only those cells >12 μm (dark purple in Figure 4B) to be blasts. By restricting ourselves to cell size, we
could also be including subpopulations such as promyelocytes (13–25
μm),34 myelocytes (12–15 μm),35 and histiocytes (15–25 μm).31 Larger-sized cells, for example, megakaryocytes
(35–150 μm),34 are excluded,
as they are too large to enter into the node pore utilized. Using
our size cutoff of >12 μm, we determined the blast-cell population
to be 43%, 44%, and 34% for Patient 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This
is in remarkable agreement with the FCM blast percentages of 46%,
36%, and 39% for the respective patients.

Again, defining positive
expression for a particular surface marker
as τnorm > 1 + 2σisotype (SI), we determined Patient 1, 2, and 3′s
normalized blast-cell transit-time distribution for each surface marker,
as shown in Figure 4B. The dashed vertical
green lines indicate the positive-expression cutoff. Although all
three patients showed a high percentage of cells that expressed CD13
and CD45, there was high variability in HLA-DR and CD34 expression.
These results were consistent with our FCM data (Figures 4C, S-7–S-9). In
fact, by employing a χ2 test with a p-value = 0.05 (SI), we find that, with
the exception of Patient 2’s CD34 expression, there were no
statistically significant differences between the results obtained
with NPS and those of FCM (SI, Table S-4). The large χ2 value obtained for Patient 2’s
CD34 expression is again not due to a lack of NPS sensitivity, but
rather, due to the extremely low levels of expression expected (2%
in FCM) (SI). In general, however, minor
differences between NPS and FCM could mainly be attributed to their
different gating strategies, with NPS’s size gating resulting
in the potential inclusion of cells other than blasts.

Conclusions
NPS is a simple, yet accurate method to screen cells for multiple
surface markers simultaneously. Particularly attractive is the fact
that NPS is label-free and thus, unlike FCM, no sample preparation
is needed. Furthermore, unlabeled cells remain viable after screening
and can be collected for downstream analysis or culture (SI). Although the work we have highlighted here
focused on screening four surface markers simultaneously using a four
or five-node-pore device, many more markers (greater than 10) could
be screened by simply adding additional nodes into the device. Although
the signal-to-noise ratio drops as the length of the node pore increases,
sensitivity is not lost because NPS produces unique electronic signatures
that can be easily detected via spectral-domain analysis.18 This is in direct contrast to multicolor FCM,
in which careful consideration of fluorophores must be taken into
account in order to avoid spectral emission overlap, and in which
the use of highly complex analysis is necessary when overlap does
occur.3,9 Cells having a very low expression of a
particular marker (leading to fewer transient binding events), and
cells whose surface marker of interest has a low affinity to the specific
antibody in the node-pore would have very modest transit time differences
as compared to the isotype control. The time resolution of our data
acquisition system is 20 μs.25 This
resolution, in combination with employing the redundancy we demonstrated
with the node pore, can increase the detection sensitivity of NPS
in these specific cases. Currently, our screening rate is ∼15–20
cells/min (corresponding to a single cell occupying the node-pore
at any given time). We can significantly increase throughput by operating
several node-pores in parallel on a single chip, as we have demonstrated
for single pores.36 Likewise, we can employ
advanced signal processing, such as matched filtering,37 to analyze multiple cells transiting the node-pore
simultaneously. These methods can increase throughput ∼100-fold.
While this throughput still would not match that of FCM, NPS’s
primary advantages of being label-free and requiring no sample preparation
make it highly attractive. NPS could be further developed into an
integrated cell screening and sorting platform, such that subpopulations
could be sorted for further downstream analysis or culture.

Overall, NPS is a low-cost, simple multiparametric method to characterize
cells. Even with consideration of antibody costs, the NPS node-pore
platform is far less expensive than FCM. Furthermore, the platform
is compact, requiring just two 15 V batteries, an external data-acquisition
board, and a current preamplifier. Thus, unlike FCM, NPS could be
performed at the benchside or even at the bedside. The node-pore devices
are disposable and can be prepared in advance and placed in a refrigerator
(or freezer for long-term storage) until needed. NPS’s ability
to obtain multiparametric information on cells enables the user to
employ a variety of gating strategies to identify a particular subpopulation
without having to perform multiple measurements. For example, cell
size could be combined with a specific surface marker for a particular
gating strategy. Furthermore, the flexibility of soft lithography
enables one to use a variety of differently sized channels to accommodate
different sized cells. The cell screening workflow in NPS, including
the incorporation of all the necessary controls needed, emphasizes
the simplicity and user-friendliness of this method. Ultimately, NPS
has great potential to be utilized as a label-free, multimarker screening
tool for a diverse set of applications in laboratories requiring cell
characterization.
