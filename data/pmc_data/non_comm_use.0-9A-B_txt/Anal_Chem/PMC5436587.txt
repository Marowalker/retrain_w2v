Histone
proteins are subject to dynamic post-translational modifications
(PTMs) that cooperatively modulate the chromatin structure and function.
Nearly all functional PTMs are found on the N-terminal histone domains
(tails) of ∼50 residues protruding from the nucleosome core.
Using high-definition differential ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS)
with electron transfer dissociation, we demonstrate rapid baseline
gas-phase separation and identification of tails involving monomethylation,
trimethylation, acetylation, or phosphorylation in biologically relevant
positions. These are by far the largest variant peptides resolved
by any method, some with PTM contributing just 0.25% to the mass.
This opens the door to similar separations for intact proteins and
in top-down proteomics.

==== Body
Histone proteins
(H1, H2A, H2B,
H3, and H4) are extensively enzymatically modified by post-translational
modifications (PTM) such as N-methylation (me), N-acetylation (ac), or O-phosphorylation
(p) that regulate chromatin structure and function by recruiting proteins
involved in replication, transcription, DNA repair, and chromatin
compaction. Interpreting the PTM-mediated protein language necessitates
analyses of intact histones or their large domains preserving the
co-occurring multisite PTM information.1 In particular, the N-terminal domains (tails) protruding from the
nucleosome core are strongly enriched in PTMs and can be cleaved off
by endoproteinase Glu-C enzyme.2,3

The staggering
challenge here is disentangling numerous isomeric
proteoforms that feature the same set of PTMs in different positions
(PTM localization variants). While liquid chromatography (LC) techniques
such as WCX-HILIC can fractionate histones by me or ac content, many
variants still coelute.4−6 Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) by any mechanism
could characterize the individual variants, but fails for mixtures
of three or more variants, since those with internal PTM positions
yield no unique fragments.7,8

A growing alternative
or complement to LC is ion mobility spectrometry
(IMS) based on gas-phase transport properties. Linear IMS approaches
(e.g., drift tube or traveling-wave) separate ions by mobility (K) at a moderate electric field (E).9 While these can resolve many isomers including
some localization variants,10 their power
in conjunction with MS is constrained by the intrinsically tight correlation
between the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and collision cross section within a chemical class. That correlation
is much looser for differential or field asymmetric waveform IMS (FAIMS)
that sorts ions by the difference of mobilities at high and low field
strength.11−13

In FAIMS, a gas flow moves ions through a gap
between two electrodes.
A periodic asymmetric field established there (with a short segment
of high positive E and long segment of low negative E) pushes ions toward one of the electrodes, depending on
the difference between the mobilities in the two segments. A fixed
compensation voltage (CV) superposed on the waveform can equilibrate
a given species and let it through the gap into MS analyzer.14,15 The resolution is maximized by strong homogeneous field in planar
gaps, precise waveforms and He/N2 or H2/N2 buffers.16−18 Another path to higher FAIMS resolution is adding
gas modifiers (usually organic volatiles) that cluster with ions in
the low-field segment and desorb upon collisional heating in the high-field
segment. However, this approach was mostly demonstrated for small
singly charged molecules rather than peptides or proteins.19,20 One problem with extending it to multiply charged ions such as peptides
generated by electrospray ionization (ESI) is the proton transfer
to vapor modifiers that have higher proton affinity than N2, He, or H2.21 Some proposed
means to mitigate that22 would be explored
in the future. Here we employ the He/N2 buffers established
in proteomic analyses using FAIMS.

The variants separated by
any method need to be identified. Assigning
the FAIMS spectral peaks using standards can be realistic in targeted
applications, but global analyses and discovery of novel proteoforms
call for peptide identification by MS/MS. Large multiply charged modified
peptides are optimally sequenced by electron transfer dissociation
(ETD) that severs the backbone, but not weaker PTM links, producing
informative c- and z-fragments,23 which enable detailed analyses of complete histone
H3 tails.24,25

Previous IMS and FAIMS studies focused
on the localization variants
of peptides in the bottom-up range, with the largest separated species
being methylated or acetylated H3 and H4 mini-tails with ∼20–25
residues.26,27 The ETD characterization of FAIMS-resolved
variants was limited to even smaller peptides (∼1.5 kDa).7,8 Such segments cannot reveal the full PTM information encoded in
histones. The position of a single PTM would intuitively affect the
3-D geometries of larger peptides less, diminishing their resolution
by IMS methods. Here we demonstrate widely applicable FAIMS separation
of complete isomeric 5.4 kDa histone tails that contain nearly all
histone PTMs–a major capability for proteomics and epigenetic
research.

Experimental Section
Materials and Reagents
Reagents
were from Sigma, except
2-Cl-(Trt)-Cl resin (GenScript), 9-fluorenylmethyl carbazate (TCI
chemicals), Fmoc-Lys(Me, Boc)-OH (AnaSpec), Fmoc-Lys(Me)3-OH (GL Biochem), Fmoc-Lys(Ac)-OH, Fmoc-Ser (PO(OBzl)OH)-OH, Fmoc-Thr(PO(OBzl)OH)-OH,
and Fmoc-Tyr(PO(OBzl)OH)-OH (Merck) and VA-04 (J&K). The HPLC
column was XSelect CSH C18 Prep Column 10 × 250 mm, 130 Å,
5 μm bead diameter (Waters).

Synthesis of Histone Tail
Standards
These standards
were obtained by producing two peptides of 25 residues each via Fmoc
SPPS and joining them via native chemical ligation (NCL).28 The Fmoc hydrazide beads were prepared in-house
with 0.49 mmol/g loading. The part I (ARTKQTARKSTGGKAPRKQLATKA)
was synthesized on Fmoc-hydrazine 2CTC resin, the part II (CRKSAPATGGVKKPHRYRPGTVALR)
was produced on Wang resin with Glu residue attached. The amounts
of 10 μmole at a time were made on Intavis ResPep SPPS machine
using the program specified in the SI.
The peptides were detached from resin by the cleavage solution (80%
TFA, 2.5% H2O, 2.5% DTT, 15% triisopropylsilane) and precipitated
by adding 10× volumes of ice-cold diethyl ether. The resulting
part I contained a hydrazine group at its C-terminus, while the part
II started with Cys. Both parts were purified on the Waters XSelect
CSH C18 column using Akta Purifier 900 (HPLC conditions in the SI).

In the NCL step, the parts I and II
were resuspended at 10 mg in 100 μL of 6 M GndCl (pH 2.0), with
3.4 mg MPAA added for part II. The hydrazine in part I was converted
to an azide by oxidation for 20 min at −15 °C on an acetone–ice
bath by adding 10 μL of 0.5 M NaNO2. The two solutions
were then combined and pH adjusted to 7.0 using 6 M NaOH. After 4–6
h, the reaction was stopped by adding 20 uL of 0.5 M TCEP (pH 7.0)
for 20 min. The product was purified on a PD-mini trap column (GE-healthcare)
and dried under vacuum. Desulfurization was performed using the Va-044
azo initiator.29

FAIMS Operation
Histone tails standards were analyzed
employing our FAIMS device with 1.9 mm gap width, coupled to the Thermo
LTQ XL ion trap with electrospray ionization (ESI) source and electron
transfer dissociation (ETD) stage via a slit aperture/ion funnel interface.8,16 The waveform amplitude (dispersion voltage) was 4 kV, the CV scan
rate was 0.33 V/min, and the flow of carrier gas (65% He/35% N2) was 2 L/min. Samples were delivered for analysis using 20
μM i.d. glass emitters prepared by chemical etching.30 Raw data was processed using MSconvert (Proteowizard
package)31 and a custom R script.

FAIMS/ETD
Analyses
The ETD data were recorded by successively
setting the CVs to apexes of major peaks in FAIMS and fragmenting
transmitted ions. The initial FAIMS/ETD work has involved 2+ and 3+
precursors, which produced the 1+ fragments only, and used single
reaction time (tETD) of 120 ms.7,8,32 Present larger peptides with
much higher z yield multiply charged fragments with z up to 5. With the limited resolving power of ion trap,
rich ETD MS/MS spectra of large peptides include many mass interferences.
Longer tETD permit more consecutive ETD
steps, yielding different fragments with overall lower z. To disentangle those interferences and raise the informative content
of spectra, all species were fragmented at tETD of 15, 30, and 150 ms. For utmost specificity, we performed
MS/MS in the zoom and ultrazoom modes. As these are less sensitive
than the normal mode, each ETD spectrum was acquired for 10 min. The
final ETD MS/MS spectra are combinations of regions extracted from
the spectra with different tETD.

Results
and Discussion
Variant Separations
To evaluate
FAIMS separation we
produced 18 proteoforms of human H3.1 tail (residues 2–51,
monoisotopic mass of 5350 Da) with PTMs in biologically relevant positions
(Table 1) by combination
of Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis and native chemical ligation
using novel hydrazide chemistry.28

P	T3, T6, S10, S28, Y41	
The modified variants (5 μM solutions in water
with 0.1%
formic acid) were initially infused individually, and then their FAIMS
spectra (plots of signal vs CV) were overlaid. To correct for uncontrolled
fluctuations of operating parameters (primarily the ambient pressure
and temperature), the CV axes of individual FAIMS spectra were linearly
scaled using an internal calibrant - the unmodified tail (1 μM).
For transferability across devices with unequal gap widths, the CV
scale is expressed as the compensation field (EC).

Figure 1 illustrates
the experimental concept. Trimethylated tails form charge states z = 8–12 (Figure 1A), each exhibiting a unique FAIMS spectrum (Figure 1B,C). Overall, the
10+ peaks were most intense and permitted maximum discrimination for
monomethylated, acetylated, and phosphorylated variants (Figure 2A–C, S1). Only five variants (K4me, K9me, K23me3,
K9ac, K27ac) of the 18 total exhibited secondary features at >20%
of the base peak heights at this charge. We baseline-resolved all
variants for me, two groups for me3 (K4/K36, K9/K23/K27), three groups
for ac (K9, K14/K27, K18/K36), and four for p (S10, S28/Y41, T3, T6).
Since binary variant mixtures can be fully characterized using ETD,7,8 the only case not completely solved by FAIMS/ETD here at z = 10 is the ternary K9me3/K23me3/K27me3 mixture. We confirmed
the robustness and reproducibility of the experimental procedure by
ensuring that the spectra for binary and ternary variant mixtures
matched the superimposed spectra for individual species (Figures 2D–F, S2, and S3).

tail (A) and FAIMS

Figure 2 FAIMS spectra for monomethylated, acetylated, and phosphorylated
histone tails at z = 10 (A–C), same for the
spectra for selected tertiary mixtures (D–F). The spectra for
individual variants are normalized in (A)–(C), vertically scaled
to match the features for the mixture in (D)–(F). The sums
of spectra for all variants are also shown in (D)–(F).

Orthogonality of Separation
across Charge States
The
separations in different charge states are mutually independent (orthogonal),26,27,33 hence, the variants overlapping
at one z are often resolved at another. For example,
the overlaps at z = 10 are fully resolved at other
charge states: K4me3/K36me3 at z = 8, 11, and 12;
K9me3/K23me3 and K9me3/K27me3 at z = 11; K14ac/K27ac
at z = 11, 12; K18ac/K36ac and S28p/Y41p at z = 9, 12 (Figure S1). The only
partly unresolved binary isomeric pair was K23me3/K27me3, with the
best (half-maximum) resolution at z = 11 (Figure 1C). As the result,
the me3 variants were best separated at z = 11 (Figure 1C).

To assess
said orthogonality systematically, we tabulated the EC values for tallest peaks of all variants with trimethylation,
acetylation, and phosphorylation PTMs in every charge state (Table S1) and computed their pairwise correlations
(Table S2). For example, the plot of EC for five me3 variants at z = 10 versus those at z = 11 reveals a linear correlation
of R2 = 0.01 (Figure S4a), and the average R2 for all
30 charge state pairs (10 pairs for every PTM) is 0.25, suggesting
no significant correlation. This conclusion is confirmed by rigorous
statistical tests (see SI) and clearly
seen in Figure S4b.

Separation of Acetylated
and Trimethylated Peptides
Attachment of me3 (42.047 Da)
and ac (42.011 Da) to lysine residues
is mutually exclusive and has different functional outcomes. For example,
(i) H3K9me3 or H3K27me3 are repressing marks, whereas H3K9ac or H3K27ac
activate transcription,34,35 (ii) H3K36me3 occurs
predominantly in the coding regions of genes and participates in transcriptional
elongation, whereas H3K36ac is localized in the promoters and facilitates
transcription initiation.36 Baseline MS
resolution of the tails with me3 and ac requires resolving power of
∼3 × 105 (and ∼8 × 105 for whole H3) in theory, and is commonly precluded by spectral congestion
in practice. However, me3 and ac may well favor distinct 3-D geometries,
enabling FAIMS separation. Of our three tail pairs with me3 or ac
on same residue, two (PTM on K27 or K36) were resolved baseline and
one (PTM on K9) nearly so (Figures 3 and S5).

Figure 3 Normalized FAIMS spectra
for the tails trimethylated or acetylated
at K27 and their mixture.

Confirmation by ETD
The ETD data unequivocally prove
the variant resolution seen at the precursor level. For instance,
all fragments observed at high S/N ratio corroborate the separation
of T3p/S10p/Y41p mixture (Figure 4).

Figure 4 FAIMS/ETD analysis of tertiary mixture of phosphorylated
tails:
FAIMS spectrum (left) and selected ETD spectral windows (from the
data at various tETD) comprising the informative
fragments with schematic sequences on top (right).

Parallel results for other representative binary
and tertiary mixtures
(K4me1/K9me1/K23me1; K4me3/K27me3; K9ac/K14ac/K36ac; K9ac/K18ac/K27ac;
T6p/S10p/S28p) show the general utility of procedure (Figure S6). For utmost specificity, we performed
MS/MS in the zoom mode. While the ultrazoom mode delivers yet greater
MS resolution, a limited scan range of 100 m/z units and low signal demand long acquisitions; we obtained
one spectrum to prove feasibility (Figure S7).

Conclusions
We have demonstrated near-universal complete
separation of PTM
localization variants (involving methylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation
at distinct residues) for peptides above 5 kDa, where PTMs amount
to 0.25–1.5% of the peptide mass. The maximum EC difference between principal peaks is ∼10–15%
with all PTMs (e.g., for K4me/K9me at 10+, K4me/36me3 at 9+, K9/K14ac
at 11+, or T6p/S10p at 10+), same as or only moderately below the
values for methylated or acetylated mini-tails (2–3 kDa).26,27 Hence, the separation space narrows quite gradually (if at all)
for longer peptides, encouraging us to extend this FAIMS approach
to yet larger peptides and intact proteins. In fact, the 5.4 kDa histone
tails explored here approach the size of small proteins (e.g., insulin
at 5.8 kDa). In principle, the orthogonality of separations between
charge states expands the overall FAIMS peak capacity for polypeptides
in proportion to the number of charge states (n)
output by the ion source. With regular ESI, n scales
roughly as the (peptide mass)1/2 or faster,37 increasing from 2–3 for typical tryptic
peptides (∼1–1.5 kDa) to at least 5 for present tails
to ∼10–15 for smaller proteins (∼10–20
kDa).38 That number can be augmented by
generating higher z via supercharging and lower z via proton stripping.39,40 This trend
largely underlies the success of this work and will facilitate the
separation of localization variants for proteins. The main problem
here is the ubiquitous conformational multiplicity (at charge states
besides 10+ here), which would be more important for real samples
with unequal variant abundances. We will seek to reduce that multiplicity
by optimizing the ESI and FAIMS conditions.

Biological histone
samples exhibit much higher complexity and dynamic
range than the mixtures of standards in this study. The true variant
distribution is convoluted in the analysis with nonuniformities of
ionization efficiency, transmission through the FAIMS gap, and ETD
yield in total and for specific informative fragments.8 This may facilitate or impede the detection of any variant
in the presence of others. These discrimination effects are generally
unequal across charge states, making the apparently redundant separations
in multiple states helpful in practice.

While the filtering
mechanism of FAIMS enables adding it to all
MS instrument types, ion trapping platforms that effect extended accumulation
and multistep fragmentation by ETD and other methods are eminently
suitable. Analyses of real histone samples demand much higher MS peak
capacity and mass accuracy provided by Fourier-Transform (FT) MS instruments
in the Orbitrap or FTICR implementations. However, turbomolecular
pumps are less effective for light gases (He or H2) with
fast Brownian motion than all air components (N2, O2, Ar, CO2). That is manageable with FAIMS stages
employing those gases coupled to ion traps operating at ∼10–5 Torr, but not to Orbitrap MS that needs ultrahigh
vacuum (10–10 Torr).41 We are currently re-engineering the FAIMS stages and Orbitrap vacuum
system to enable addition of high-resolution FAIMS using helium-rich
buffers.

Comprehensive analyses also require an LC step in front
to partition
histone tails into fractions with same number of acetyl and methyl
PTMs.4 The challenge for online LC/FAIMS
integration is time scale mismatch: the typical chromatographic peak
width is ∼10 s, while a full high-resolution FAIMS scan takes
∼10 min. One established solution is replacing a gradual FAIMS
scan by stepping through discrete CVs.42 This approach best fits targeted applications, for example, distinguishing
several peptide variants with known CVs such as present histone tails.
In external convolution, the same LC gradient is repeated with different
fixed CVs in a mode resembling selected reaction monitoring in MS.43,44 In internal convolution, the CV is rapidly stepped through several
values (with dwell times of a few s) in a mode resembling multiple
reaction monitoring while LC peak elutes.43,45,46 An alternative is off-line LC fractionation
followed by direct infusion. We foresee the integration of high-definition
FAIMS with 2-D LC and FTMS to allow unprecedentedly comprehensive
characterization of proteomes and proteoforms.
