Unexpected tryptic
cleavage has been characterized at modified
K48 residues in polyubiquitins. In particular, the tryptic products
of all seven of the lysine-linked dimers of ubiquitin and of three
trimers—linear Ub–48Ub–48Ub, linear Ub–63Ub–63Ub, and
the branched trimer [Ub]2–6,48Ub—have
been analyzed. In addition to the peptide products expected under
commonly used tryptic conditions, we observe that peptides are formed
with an unexpected ε-glycinylglycinyl-Lys carboxyl terminus
when the site of linkage is Lys48. Trypsin from three different commercial
sources exhibited this aberration. Initial cleavage at R74 is proposed
in a distal ubiquitin to produce a glycinylglycinyl-lysine residue
which is bound by trypsin.

==== Body
Proteolysis
by trypsin is commonly
used in proteomic workflows and other biochemical investigations.
It is solidly established that the enzyme cleaves proteins and peptides
on the carboxyl side of lysine and arginine residues1,2 employing a well-understood specific binding mechanism that recognizes
the basic side chains of those amino acids.3−5 It is generally
observed that derivatized lysine and arginine residues are not substrates
for the enzyme,1,2,6 and
this behavior has been used to good advantage to recognize and localize
modifications on Lys and Arg in histones and other proteins.

Ubiquitin is enzymatically conjugated with substrate proteins and
other ubiquitin moieties through isopeptide bonds between its terminal
Gly76 and ε-amino groups of lysine residues (Figure 1). The extent and nature of
such conjugations have profound effects on protein function and disposition
in the cell. Trypsin can cleave all the potential sites in these polypeptides
in an exhaustive incubation; however, it cleaves ubiquitin at Arg74
very rapidly,7 leaving Gly75 and Gly76
residues on the modified lysine of the substrate peptide.8−11 Likewise, in the case of polyubiquitins, rapid tryptic cleavage
of a distal ubiquitin at Arg74 leaves an ε-glycinylglycine tag
on lysine at the site of conjugation in the proximal ubiquitin.12,13 This glycinylglycine tag is susceptible to analysis by HPLC, tandem
mass spectrometry, and bioinformatics, and its formation and localization
have formed the basis for much of our understanding of the biochemistry
of ubiquitination.9,10 Neither ubiquitinated lysine
nor ε-glycinylglycinyl-Lys is expected to be cleaved by trypsin.
However, in a recent study of ubiquitinated conjugates in exosomes
shed by myeloid-derived suppressor cells, 15 of 65 ε-glycinylglycinyl-peptide
products had been formed by tryptic cleavage directly at the derivatized
lysine residues.11 These included products
from polyubiquitins as well as protein conjugates. Other laboratories
have also recently reported peptides identified from tryptic digests
of ubiquitin polymers and conjugates that are terminated in ε-glycinylglycinyl-Lys.10,14,15 The experiments reported here
were designed to confirm rigorously or not that this irregular tryptic
cleavage occurs in polyubiquitins and, by implication, in proteins
conjugated with ubiquitins. Unexpectedly, we have observed that the
irregular cleavage occurs in polyubiquitins specifically at linkages
located at Lys48.

The peptide product that results from the expected formation of the
glycinylglycinyl tag from the distal chain and conventional cleavages
at Arg42 and Arg54 in the proximal chain is highlighted. Bottom: The
peptide product that results from formation of the glycinylglycinyl
tag from the distal chain and cleavage at Arg42 and the unexpected
cleavage at Lys48 in the proximal chain is highlighted. (In a ubiquitin–ubiquitin
conjugate, distal refers to the ubiquitin unit that is conjugated
through its C-terminal Gly76 to a lysine on another ubiquitin, referred
to as proximal. In a branched triubiquitin such as [Ub]2–6,48Ub, two distal ubiquitins are attached to
two different lysines, in this case Lys6 and Lys48, on the same proximal
ubiquitin.)

Experimental Section
Polyubiquitins
All seven of the lysine-linked ubiquitin
dimers were available for this study, as well as two unbranched trimers,
Ub–48Ub–48Ub and Ub–63Ub–63Ub, and the branched trimer [Ub]2–6,48Ub. Ubiquitin dimers were assembled
either enzymatically (K48, K63) or chemically (K6, K11, K27, K29,
K33) using recombinant ubiquitin monomers, as detailed in ref (16). Ubiquitin trimers were
assembled enzymatically using linkage-specific ubiquitin-conjugating
E2 enzymes.

Tryptic Digestion
All tryptic digestions
were carried
out under commonly used conditions: 16 h at 37 °C, in 50 mM ammonium
bicarbonate, pH 7.8, using a 1:50 (ubiquitin dimers) or 1:20 (ubiquitin
trimers) ratio of enzyme to substrate. Briefer incubation times were
implemented in kinetic studies. Trypsin Gold, mass spectrometry grade
porcine trypsin from Promega, was used in the majority of the 16 h
digestions and in kinetic studies. However, TPCK (tosylphenylalanyl
chloromethyl ketone)-immobilized bovine pancreatic trypsin (Thermo
Pierce) and underivatized bovine pancreatic trypsin free from mycoplasma
and extraneous viruses (Worthington Biochemical) were also evaluated.

Mass Spectrometry
The product mixtures were analyzed
by LC–MS/MS using Prominence LC20ADnano pumps (Shimadzu Scientific)
interfaced to an LTQ–orbitrap (Thermo Fisher) tandem mass spectrometer.
This product mixture comprised mostly short peptides, which were separated
on a capillary C18 column (150 × 0.15 mm, 300 Å, Grace Davidson
Discovery Sciences), increasing the gradient from 0% to 50% solvent
B (97.5% acetonitrile, 2.5% water, and 0.1% formic acid) through 23
min, followed by an increase from 50% to 85% solvent B in 2 min. Solvent
A was 2.5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water. The flow rate
was 500 nL/min. Precursor scans of product mixtures were acquired
in the orbitrap with a resolution of 30 000 at m/z 400, and product ion scans were acquired at unit
resolution in the LTQ. The mixture of tryptic peptides from the K48
dimer was also analyzed at 30 000 resolution at m/z 40 for both precursor ions and fragment ions.
In addition to data-dependent analysis, the precursor ions listed
in Table 1 and Table 2 were selected for
targeted analysis. Product mixtures were analyzed from six replicate
digestions of each ubiquitin trimer, and three to six replicate digestions
of each dimer were studied.

Bioinformatics
A MASCOT search was
performed against
the SwissProt human database with an automatic decoy search and allowing
one missed cleavage. Precursor and fragment ion tolerances of 5 ppm
and 0.6 Da, respectively, were used. Glycinylglycine-modified lysine
was allowed as a variable modification. Technical and proteolytic
replicates were scored using MASCOT’s “MudPit”
function.

Kinetic Studies
Tryptic products of ubiquitin dimers
recovered after brief digestions (5, 15, 30, 60, and 90 min) in kinetic
studies were fractionated using a capillary C3 column (150 mm ×
0.1 mm, 0.5 μm, Agilent) with the same gradient described above
and a flow rate of 300 nL/min. Ions were measured in the orbitrap
with a resolution of 30 000 at m/z 400. Data sets were deconvoluted, and peak areas were determined
in selected ion current chromatograms.

Results and Discussion
Examination of tryptic products from more than 30 experiments indicates
that digestion is exhaustive under the conditions used for the 16
h proteolysis with each of the three samples of trypsin. The tryptic
peptide LIFAGKGGQLEDGR [43–54] (Figure 1) was formed from the Ub–48Ub dimer by the expected mechanism with Trypsin Gold. Moreover,
an additional glycinylglycinyl-peptide, LIFAGKGG [43–48],
was identified, in which tryptic cleavage had occurred at Lys48 to
produce a peptide terminated by glycinylglycinyl-Lys48 (Figure 1). As described in the Experimental Section, the peptide was identified
by an unbiased search of its tandem mass spectrum (Figure 2A) against the SwissProt human
protein database The peptide LIFAGKGG was identified with
an expect value of 0.014 (Supplemental Table 1, Supporting Information).

LIFAGKGG formed
in tryptic digestion of (A) ubiquitin dimer Ub–48Ub, (B) ubiquitin trimer Ub–48Ub–48Ub, and (C) ubiquitin trimer [Ub]2–6,48Ub.

The production of both the expected
and aberrant tryptic peptides
in the tryptic product mixture is confirmed by the extracted ion chromatograms
shown in Figure 3.
The ratio of the expected glycinylglycinyl product to the novel peptide
is approximately 5:1, estimated by peak areas in the ion chromatograms
(Figure 3). These two
peptides and the corresponding glycinylglycinyl-peptides that might
be formed from dimers with other linkage sites are listed in Table 1. Comments in the table confirm that the expected tryptic
products were observed for all the dimers, formed with cleavage of
the distal ubiquitin at Arg74, blocked cleavage at the glycinylglycinyl-lysine
in the proximal ubiquitin, and cleavage at the next lysine or arginine.
The absence to at least the 1% level of any peptides formed by aberrant
cleavages in the product mixtures from the other dimers is supported
by extracted ion chromatograms and targeted MS/MS experiments. The
aberrant or unexpected product was also found to be formed when the
Ub–48Ub dimer was incubated with TPCK-immobilized
bovine pancreatic trypsin (expected:unexpected = 85:1) and mycoplasma-
and extraneous-virus-free underivatized bovine pancreatic trypsin
(expected:unexpected = 91:1). The differences in product distribution
suggest that bovine trypsin cleaves the Ub–48Ub
dimer with more fidelity than porcine trypsin, not surprising in view
of the significant differences documented recently in proteolysis
of albumin by porcine and bovine trypsin.17

Table 2 reports glycinylglycinyl-peptides recovered from the
Trypsin Gold digestion of two unbranched ubiquitin trimers, Ub–63Ub–63Ub and Ub–48Ub–48Ub, and the branched trimer [Ub]2–6,48Ub. In the case of Ub–63Ub–63Ub, only the expected cleavage products are observed, with
no cleavage of lysine at the sites of conjugation. In the case of
Ub–48Ub–48Ub, the expected product
[43–54] is formed with cleavage at Arg54, and in addition,
peptide [43–48] is identified in which the carboxyl terminus
carries the glycinylglycinyl tag (Figure 2B). The third trimer offers a Lys48 modification
and also one at Lys6. Digestion with Trypsin Gold produced the expected
peptides with missed cleavages at glycinylglycinyl-Lys6 and -Lys48.
In addition, a third product was identified, on the basis of accurate
mass determination and tandem mass spectra, which terminates in glycinylglycinyl-Lys48
(Figure 2C). Overall,
the digestion products detected from these trimers further support
the conclusion that proteolysis occurs uniquely at modified Lys48,
and not at Lys residues modified at other positions in polyubiquitins.

These
observations introduce several questions: What is the substrate
for trypsin that produces the unexpected cleavage? Why does the aberrant
cleavage take place selectively at substituted K48 in polyubiquitins?

A kinetic study presented in Supplemental Figure 1 (Supporting Information) shows rapid tryptic cleavage
at R74 through the first 90 min of digestion of Ub–48Ub and Ub–63Ub dimers and the absence of detectable
cleavage at K48 and K63, respectively. This is consistent with earlier
reports.7,12,13 We propose
that peptides carrying glycinylglycinyl-lysine are bound by trypsin
as substrates for subsequent cleavage to produce the unexpected product
(Figure 1). This binding
would occur in competition with normal substrates. Because the glycinylglycine
fragment carries a positive charge at its N-terminus and contains
no bulky groups, it is bound in the recognition pocket by which trypsin
normally recognizes Lys and Arg side chains. This surrogate binding
may not position the polypeptide chain correctly to allow cleavage
to occur at the normal rate. The binding pocket of trypsin is 10–12
Å deep, on the basis of crystal structures.18,19 On the basis of a crystal structure available for the K48-linked
ubiquitin dimer,20 the length of the extended
lysine side chain modified by glycinylglycine is 10.9 Å. It is
relevant that S-(β-1-aminoethyl)cysteine, a
side chain that also presents a positive terminal charge, was recognized
as a substrate for trypsin some years ago.21

The second question is more challenging. If the substrate
for the
unexpected cleavage is not ubiquitin-modified Lys48, but rather glycinylglycinyl-Lys48-Ub,
then we need to ask why trypsin binds and cleaves glycinylglycinyl-Lys
at position 48 of diubiquitin, but does not bind and cleave glycinylglycinyl-Lys
at other positions. In an initial consideration of the primary sequence,
we used the MEROPS tool22 to correlate
cleavage frequencies experimentally associated with the three residues
N-terminal and four residues C-terminal to the cleavage sites in the
various ubiquitin dimers. Although the sequence around K48 scored
well, considerations of primary sequence were not definitive and suggest
that tertiary structure and topology should be considered. The compact
and dynamic structures of all the linkage types of diubiquitin have
been modeled recently and found to be distinctive.23,24 We speculate that trypsin has a specific interaction with the surface
of ubiquitin around Lys48 and that this interaction promotes binding
and/or cleavage of glycinylglycinyl-Lys48 as a substrate. We are currently
exploring the possibility of such an interaction using NMR.

In summary, we have confirmed that trypsin does cleave some polyubiquitins
to produce peptides that carry glycinylglycinyl-lysine at the carboxyl
terminus. We propose that rapid cleavage of a distal ubiquitin chain
occurs first in these cases, and that the resulting glycinylglycinyl-lysine
side chain is bound as a surrogate to arginine (or lysine) in trypsin’s
active site. Subsequent proteolysis can occur if the polypeptide chain
is suitably positioned on the enzyme. This hypothesis is extended
to proteins conjugated with ubiquitin, consistent with reports of
unexpected formation of peptides with glycinylglycinyl-lysine carboxyl
termini.10,11,14,15 These observations suggest that qualitative and quantitative
studies that rely on analysis only of peptides carrying internal glycinylglycinyl
tags may require reinterpretation.
