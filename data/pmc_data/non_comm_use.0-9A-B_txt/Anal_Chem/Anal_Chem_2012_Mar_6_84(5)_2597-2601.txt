The analysis of intact glycopeptides by mass spectrometry
is challenging
due to the numerous possibilities for isomerization, both within the
attached glycan and the location of the modification on the peptide
backbone. Here, we demonstrate that high field asymmetric wave ion
mobility spectrometry (FAIMS), also known as differential ion mobility,
is able to separate isomeric O-linked glycopeptides that have identical
sequences but differing sites of glycosylation. Two glycopeptides
from the glycoprotein mucin 5AC, GT(GalNAc)TPSPVPTTSTTSAP and GTTPSPVPTTST(GalNAc)TSAP
(where GalNAc is O-linked N-acetylgalactosamine), were shown to coelute
following reversed-phase liquid chromatography. However, FAIMS analysis
of the glycopeptides revealed that the compensation voltage ranges
in which the peptides were transmitted differed. Thus, it is possible
at certain compensation voltages to completely separate the glycopeptides.
Separation of the glycopeptides was confirmed by unique reporter ions
produced by supplemental activation electron transfer dissociation
mass spectrometry. These fragments also enable localization of the
site of glycosylation. The results suggest that glycan position plays
a key role in determining gas-phase glycopeptide structure and have
implications for the application of FAIMS in glycoproteomics.

==== Body
Glycosylation of proteins is
the most common post-translational modification in eukaryotic cells:
It has been estimated that up to 50% of human proteins are glycosylated.1 Glycoproteins are involved in a range of intracellular
and cell–cell recognition events,2,3 and abnormalities
in glycosylation are associated with disease. For example, a decrease
in O-linked glycosylation of microtubule-associated protein tau has
been shown in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.4 Similarly, aberrant glycosylation of IgA1 is implicated
in IgA nephropathy.5 Proteins are glycosylated
at either asparagine (N-linked) or serine, threonine, and tyrosine
residues (O-linked). N-glycosylation occurs within the consensus sequence
Asn-X-Ser/Thr, where X is any amino acid except Pro, whereas no consensus
sequence exists for O-glycosylation. Glycoproteomics is the large
scale analysis of glycoproteins and typically involves digestion of
the proteins with trypsin and analysis of the resulting glycopeptides.6 There is enormous scope for isomers within the
glycopeptides: Due to the numerous possible combinations of different
monosaccharide base units, glycosylation is one of the most complex
post-translational modifications.7 It is
possible to have both structural and positional isomers, i.e., glycans
that differ in glycosidic linkage arrangements and in branching structures.
In addition, and particularly for O-glycosylation, there is the potential
for localization isomers, i.e., glycopeptides with identical sequences
but differing modification sites.

Glycosylation has been studied
by mass spectrometry for many years
but the assignment and localization of glycans on glycopeptides remains
a challenge. Typically, the proteomics workflow involves online liquid
chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The
MS/MS technique collision induced dissociation (CID) results in loss
of the glycan while the peptide backbone remains intact,6 hindering the identification of both the peptide
sequence and the site of glycosylation. Electron capture dissociation
and electron transfer dissociation (ETD) of glycopeptides results
in retention of the glycan chain on the peptide backbone fragments,
allowing localization of the modification site.8−11 However, glycans are acidic modifications,
and glycosylated peptides are commonly only observed as singly, doubly,
or triply charged ions with high m/z values. These types of ions often produce ETD spectra with few fragment
ions.12 Recently, several methods have
been developed which combine CID and ETD to better determine the sequence
of glycopeptides.13−15 Nevertheless, these various methods do not address
the underlying issue of isomeric glycopeptides which coelute following
liquid chromatography.

High field asymmetric wave ion mobility
spectrometry16,17 (FAIMS), or differential ion
mobility, separates gas-phase ions
at atmospheric pressure. Ions are transferred between two heated electrodes
by a carrier gas. Voltages are applied to the electrodes via an asymmetric
waveform producing alternate high and low electric fields perpendicular
to the direction of the ions. As a result of their differential mobility,
ions are attracted toward one of the electrodes to a greater extent
than the other. In the absence of intervention, the ions will collide
with the electrode. To prevent that from happening, a dc compensation
voltage (CV) is superimposed. By tuning the CV, it is possible to
selectively transmit particular ions through the FAIMS device into
the mass spectrometer. The FAIMS device can therefore be used as an
ion filter, effectively reducing signal-to-noise,18 increasing sensitivity,19,20 and increasing
dynamic range.21

As FAIMS separates
ions according to their differential ion mobility,
rather than m/z, it may be applied
for the analysis of isobaric species: The amino acids leucine and
isoleucine can be separated by FAIMS,22 as can the ortho, meta, and para forms of phthalic acid.23 We have shown previously that FAIMS can separate
isobaric phosphopeptides, i.e., those with identical sequence but
differing sites of phosphorylation.24,25 In further
work, we have shown that FAIMS may be used to separate sequence isomers
of nitrated peptides.26 Fenn and McLean
have separated structural and positional isomeric glycans27 by drift tube ion mobility spectrometry and
traveling wave ion mobility spectrometry; however, to date, there
have been no reports of ion mobility separation of intact glycopeptides.

Here, we demonstrate FAIMS separation of two glycopeptide localization
isomers from the glycoprotein mucin 5AC: GT(GalNAc)TPSPVPTTSTTSAP
and GTTPSPVPTTST(GalNAc)TSAP, where GalNAc is O-linked N-acetylgalactosamine.
These glycopeptides coelute following reversed-phase liquid chromatography.
FAIMS separation was confirmed by supplemental activation (sa) ETD
mass spectrometry. As the differential ion mobility of an ion is intrinsically
linked to its structure, our finding suggests that the position of
the glycan affects the gas-phase structure of the glycopeptides. Our
findings have implications for the field of glycoproteomics: The ability
to separate isomeric glycopeptides will further enable identification
of isoforms and ultimately improve glycoproteome coverage.

Methods
Sample Preparation
The glycopeptides from Mucin 5AC
with the sequences, GTTPSPVPTTSTTSAP
and GTTPSPVPTTSTTSAP (where T represents the threonine amino acid residue
modified with N-acetylgalactosamine, GalNAc), herein referred to as
peptides A and B, respectively, were supplied
by Anaspec (Fremont, CA) and used without further purification. For
the LC-ETD MS/MS experiments, the samples were resuspended in water
(J. T. Baker, The Netherlands) to a final concentration of 20 fmol/μL.
For the FAIMS experiments, the samples were resuspended in water and
diluted in water/methanol (both J. T. Baker, The Netherlands) (30:70)
containing 2% formic acid (Sigma Aldrich, Poole,
Dorset), to a final concentration of 2 pmol/μL.

LC-ETD MS/MS
Online liquid chromatography was performed
by use of a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Sunnyvale, USA). A 1:1
mixture comprising 100 fmol of each peptide was loaded onto a 75 μm
(internal diameter) Acclaim PepMap100 (LC Packings, Sunnyvale, USA)
C18 column (length 10 cm) and separated over a 30 min gradient
from 3.2% to 44% acetonitrile (J. T. Baker, The Netherlands) (0.1%
formic acid) at a flow rate of 350 nL/min. Eluting peptides were infused
by use of an Advion Triversa Nanomate (Ithaca, USA) electrospray ionization
source directly into a Thermo Scientific LTQ-Orbitrap Velos ETD mass
spectrometer (Bremen, Germany). The mass spectrometer alternated between
a full FT-MS scan (m/z 380–1600)
and a sa ETD scan (conditions as below) of the most abundant precursor
ion. Survey scans were acquired in the Orbitrap with a resolution
of 60 000 at m/z 400. Precursor
ions were isolated and subjected to ETD in the linear ion trap and
recorded in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 7500 at m/z 400. Isolation width was 3 Th. Automatic gain
control (AGC) was used to accumulate sufficient precursor ions (target
value 1 × 105 charges, maximum fill time 100 ms).
Dynamic exclusion was not used.

ESI-FAIMS-ETD MS/MS
The peptides were introduced into
the mass spectrometer by direct infusion heated electrospray ionization
(HESI) at a flow rate of 3 μL/min and a temperature of 40 °C.
All FAIMS experiments were performed on an LTQ Orbitrap Velos ETD
hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany).
The FAIMS conditions were: dispersion voltage, −5 kV; inner
and outer electrode temperatures, 70 and 90 °C, respectively;
carrier gas flow rate, 2 L/min with a composition of 50:50 helium
to nitrogen. The electrospray voltage was 5 kV with a capillary temperature
of 275 °C and a sheath gas flow rate of 5 L/min. During analysis,
the compensation voltage was scanned from −59.7 to −5
V in 0.3 V steps. The precursor ion of interest was fragmented by
supplemental activation ETD at each CV interval, resulting in 180
saETD spectra. All mass spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap. An
automated method was created: The first scan event was a full scan
mass spectrum at CV of −25 V. This was followed by 180 sa ETD
mass spectra of the doubly charged precursor (m/z 852.91) with CV scanning as described above. The automatic
gain control (AGC) target for full scan and subsequent MS/MS spectra
was 1 × 106, with a maximum injection time of 1000
ms for MS spectra and 300 ms for MS/MS spectra. Both MS and MS/MS
scans were recorded with a resolution of 7500 at m/z 400. MS spectra were the result of 1 microscan,
and MS/MS were 5 summed microscans. Precursor ions were isolated with
a window of 3 Th. Supplemental activation (sa) ETD was performed in
the ion trap, with an ETD activation time of 140 ms and a normalized
collision energy (sa) of 25%.

Results and Discussion
A 1:1 mixture of the two glycopeptides
were analyzed by online
liquid chromatography saETD MS/MS. Figure 1 shows the extracted ion chromatograms of the doubly charged precursor
(m/z 852.91; black) and the reporter
ions c10 from glycopeptide A (m/z 1158.58; red) and z10 from glycopeptide B (m/z 1149.55; blue). Reporter ions are those
ETD fragments which are unique to a particular modification site within
a peptide. These results show that it is not possible to separate
these glycopeptides by reversed-phase liquid chromatography.Figure 1 The extracted
ion chromatograms for the doubly charged precursor
ion m/z 852.91 (black), fragment c10 (red) from the glycopeptide GTTPSPVPTTSTTSAP, and fragment z10 (blue) from the glycopeptide GTTPSPVPTTSTTSAP. T represents the threonine
amino acid residue modified with N-acetylgalactosamine, GalNAc.



The glycopeptides were individually infused
and analyzed by FAIMS-saETD
to assess the level of fragmentation observed, the potential number
of unique reporter ions, and the CV range over which the peptides
were transmitted. As the reporter ions are unique to a particular
modification site within a peptide, their presence can be used to
confirm the success, or otherwise, of FAIMS separation.25 For both glycopeptides A and B, singly and doubly charged ions were observed. Doubly charged
glycopeptide ions were subjected to saETD. Figure 2a shows the saETD spectrum for peptide A recorded
with at a CV of −23.7 V, approximately the midpoint in the
CV range over which the doubly charged peptide was observed. All but
three N–Cα bonds were cleaved. (Cleavage N-terminal to
proline is rare due to the cyclic nature of the side chain.28) Two peaks (m/z 1501.73 and m/z 1328.62) in the
spectrum show the loss of the GalNAc from the peptide backbone: [M
+ 2H-GalNAc]+• and z14-GalNAc. No other neutral losses of GalNAc were observed. The probable
cause of the losses of the glycan is the use of supplemental activation
with the ETD. Similarly, the presence of the y9 ion may be the result of supplemental activation, although
production of y ions is known to be a minor channel
in ETD. These results suggest that fragments c6, c8 – c12, z12, and y9 may be used as reporter ions for peptide A. The saETD spectrum for peptide B is shown in figure 2b. The spectrum was recorded at a CV of −25.5
V, the approximate midpoint of the CV range over which the doubly
charged peptide was observed. The fragmentation pattern observed is
nearly identical to that seen for peptide A; the only
differences being the absence of the c6 fragment (m/z 558.29) and the
presence of a peak corresponding to z10-GalNAc (m/z 946.46). These results
suggest that the fragment ions c8 – c12, z10, z12, and y9 may be used as reporter ions for peptide B.Figure 2 (a) Supplemental activation

V. (b) Supplemental activation ETD mass spectrum of [M + 2H]2+ ions of peptide B, recorded at a CV of −25.5
V. The CV values represent the maximum transmission of the precursor
ions through the FAIMS device.



The glycopeptides were combined in a 1:1 mixture
and analyzed using
the same method as above. The peptides “eluted” from
the FAIMS device in the compensation voltage range of −29.7
V to −19.5 V, and ETD reporter ions were observed in the CV
range of −29.1 V and −19.8 V. (At CV points −29.7,
−29.4, and −19.5 V, the ETD mass spectra contained peaks
corresponding to the charge-reduced species and the more abundant
fragments common to both glycopeptides only.) Figure 3a shows the extracted ion chromatograms for seven of the reporter
ions for peptide B (fragments c8, c9, c10, c11, c12, z10, and z12, shown in blue) and five of the reporter ions for peptide A (fragments c8, c9, c10, c11, and c12, shown in red).
The additional reporter ions for peptide A (c6 and z12) and the y9 fragments for both peptides are not shown
here because they were not observed in every spectrum. The overlaid
extracted ion chromatograms of the reporter ions for the two glycopeptides
(Figure 3a) show compensation voltage ranges
where (a) only peptide B is observed (−29.1 to
−27.3 V), (b) both glycopeptides are observed (−27.0
to −20.7 V), and (c) only peptide A is observed
(−20.4 to −19.8 V). Figure 3b
shows the saETD mass spectrum obtained at CV of −27.6 V. All
of the fragments in this mass spectrum originate from glycopeptide B. Figure 3c shows the saETD spectrum
recorded at CV −20.7 V. All the fragments in this mass spectrum
derive from glycopeptide A.Figure 3 (a) Extracted ion chromatograms for the
reporter c and z ions of peptide A (c8, c9, c10, c11, and c12, red) and peptide B (c8, c9, c10, c11, c12, z10, and z12, blue). (b) Supplemental
activation ETD mass spectrum
recorded at a CV of −27.6 V. Reporter ions for peptide B are labeled in blue. (c) Supplemental activation ETD mass
spectrum recorded at a CV of −20.7 V. Reporter ions for peptide A are labeled in red.



As FAIMS separates ions on the basis of their
differential ion
mobility, which in turn is linked to ion structure, these findings
suggest that glycopeptides have gas-phase structures dependent on
the site of glycosylation. The glycopeptides studied here are modified
by a single GalNAc unit. It is possible that steric hindrance gives
rise to differing gas-phase structures. An alternative explanation
for the separation of the two glycopeptides by FAIMS is the presence
of salt bridges between a carboxylate of the GalNAc and the amine
group of the N-terminus.29,30 We postulate that such
a salt-bridge would only be present in glycopeptide B, giving the peptide a more compact structure, and that the proximity
of the GalNAc on peptide A to the N-terminus and the
lack of other potential binding sites would hinder the formation of
such a noncovalent bond.

Conclusion
We have shown that it is possible to use
FAIMS to separate localization
isomers of O-linked glycopeptides and confirmed the separation by
saETD mass spectrometry. Glycosylation is unlike any other post-translational
modification. The complexity and heterogeneity of glycosylation can
have a dramatic effect on the structure and folding of peptides and
proteins.31 Our results suggest that structural
differences can also be observed in the gas phase and that those differences
can be exploited for the analysis of glycosylation, with potential
applications in the field of glycoproteomics.
