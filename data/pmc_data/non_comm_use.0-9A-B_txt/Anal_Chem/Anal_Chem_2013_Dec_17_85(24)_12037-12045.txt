Taking chicken Ovalbumin as a prototypical
example of a eukaryotic
protein we use high-resolution native electrospray ionization mass
spectrometry on a modified Exactive Orbitrap mass analyzer to qualitatively
and semiquantitatively dissect 59 proteoforms in the natural protein.
This variety is largely induced by the presence of multiple phosphorylation
sites and a glycosylation site that we find to be occupied by at least
45 different glycan structures. Mass analysis of the intact protein
in its native state is straightforward and fast, requires very little
sample preparation, and provides a direct view on the stoichiometry
of all different coappearing modifications that are distinguishable
in mass. As such, this proof-of-principal analysis shows that native
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in combination with an Orbitrap
mass analyzer offers a means to characterize proteins in a manner
highly complementary to standard bottom-up shot-gun proteome analysis.

==== Body
Ovalbumin
is the most prominent
protein found in egg white, making up 60–65% of the total protein
mass. Although the exact function of ovalbumin is unknown, it is generally
assumed to be a storage protein. Chicken ovalbumin consists of 385
amino acids and has a molecular mass of around 45 kDa. Ovalbumin is
decorated by a plethora of post-translational modifications (PTMs),
including N-terminal acetylation (G1), phosphorylation (most prominent
at S68 and S344), and extensive glycosylation (N292) and contains
a disulfide bridge (C73-Cys120).1,2 Due to its availability,
ovalbumin has often been used as a model system for new developments
in the separation sciences, such as liquid chromatography,3,4 capillary electrophoresis,5,6 and mass spectrometry.7 Ovalbumin does however represent quite an analytical
challenge, due to the high and diverse amount of PTMs. In most of
the reported analyses on the intact protein to date, the molecular
heterogeneity of ovalbumin hampers a complete analysis of all different
isoforms/proteoforms.8 Therefore, so far
the most successful strategies employed cleave the ovalbumin protein
first into segments, followed by analysis of the resulting peptides
and glycopeptides, or to release the glycans from generated glycopeptides
or denatured protein. In this way, from the glycan analysis, a reasonable
comprehensive view of the molecular complexity of the glycan structures
present on ovalbumin has become available. Bottom-up peptide analysis
by mass spectrometry provides a good qualitative and semiquantitative
view of the phosphorylation sites occupied in ovalbumin. Yet, all
these approaches require a variety of sample preparation steps, which
may all inherently lead to loss of particular signals.

Recently,
we introduced a modified version of an Orbitrap mass
analyzer, adapted to be able to analyze large biomolecules and molecular
assemblies.9 A nice feature of this instrument
is that it allows high mass accuracy and high resolving power of ions
also in the m/z range way above m/z 2000, enabling analysis of biomolecules
and biomolecular assemblies by electrospray ionization under native
conditions. We previously showed that this instrument allows the analysis
of intact proteasome and GroEL assemblies (Mw 700–800 kDa), and enables the mass distinction between
different stoichiometries of nucleotide (i.e., ATP, ADP) binding to
GroEL.9 To further benchmark the possibilities
of this instrument for the robust and efficient analysis of proteins,
we focus now on the mass analysis of the chicken ovalbumin protein.
The here presented native electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra
of intact ovalbumin highlight this microheterogeneity, as mentioned
above, in its full qualitative and quantitative glory, whereby we
are able to detect, identify, and semiquantify at least 59 different
proteoforms. This approach provides to the best of our knowledge the
most comprehensive analysis of proteoforms of ovalbumin to date. Moreover,
the approach presented here is generic and can be adapted to analyze
protein microheterogeneity in structural proteins, kinases, phosphatases,
etc.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Chicken ovalbumin (grade
V) and Endoglycosidase
F1 (Endo F1) were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany).
Ovalbumin consists of 385 amino acids (Uniprot Code P01012, sequence
mass 42750.19 kDa). Calf Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (CIP) was
obtained from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA).

Sample Preparation
Unprocessed ovalbumin solutions
were prepared at a concentration of 200 μM in milli-Q water
and then buffer exchanged into 150 mM aqueous ammonium acetate (AmAc)
(pH 7.5). Enzymatic dephosphorylation was performed by incubating
unprocessed ovalbumin with CIP in 50 mM triethyl ammonium bicarbonate
(TEAB) buffer (pH 7.5) at 37 °C for 2 h. The protein/enzyme ratio
was 0.5 units of CIP per 1 μg protein. Enzymatic deglycosylation
was performed by incubating 0.2 units Endo F1 with 200 μg ovalbumin
in a reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, provided with the enzyme
kit) at 37 °C overnight. Deglycosylated ovalbumin was buffer
exchanged into aqueous AmAc buffer prior to CIP dephosphorylation.

Prior to mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, the protein samples were
exchanged into 150 mM aqueous AmAc (pH 7.5) by ultrafiltration (vivaspin500,
Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Germany) with a 5 kDa cutoff. The protein
concentration was measured by UV absorbance at 280 nm and adjusted
to 2–3 μM before MS measurement.

Native MS Analysis on the
Orbitrap Mass Analyzer
One
to two microliters of individual sample was loaded into a nanoflow
gold-plated borosilicate electrospray capillary (made in house). The
sample was analyzed on a modified Exactive Plus instrument (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) over m/z range 500–10000, as described previously.9 On the basis of the length of the transients
observed, the Orbitrap resolution was set to 17500 at m/z 200. Nitrogen was used in the HCD cell and gas
pressure was manually regulated. The voltage offset on transport multiples
and ion lenses were manually tuned to achieve optimal transmission
of protein ions at elevated m/z.
The instrument was calibrated by using CsI clusters, as described
previously.9

Data Processing
The accurate masses of the observed
proteoforms were obtained by convoluting the ESI spectrum to a zero-charge
state spectrum using the Protein Deconvolution package (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). For glycan assignment, the reference molecular weights
of 5 monosaccharides were extracted from the GlycosuiteDB (ExPAsy),
and a tolerance rate (0.015) was set to give an acceptable mass range
of reference. After building a mass difference matrix between any
two of the detected masses on the dephosphorylated ovalbumin spectrum,
we consider any element that falls in one of the set masses as a match.
Glycan structures were built based on known biosynthetic pathways
and reported ovalbumin literature and were drawn using GlycoBench.10 The reference monosaccharides used were hexose/mannose/galactose
(Hex/Man/Gal, 162.1424 Da), N-acetylhexosamine/N-acetylglucosamine (HexNAc/GlcNAc, 203.1950 Da), deoxyhexose
(dHex, 146.1430 Da), N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac,
291.2579 Da), and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc,
307.2573 Da), according to symbol and text nomenclature from the Consortium
for Functional Glycomics.

Results
Preparation
of Dephosphorylated and/or Deglycosylated Ovalbumin
Enzymatic
removal of PTMs potentially simplifies the variety of
proteoforms and thus the resulting MS spectra, providing necessary
information for elucidating coappearing proteoforms. For dephosphorylation,
it is possible to remove all the phosphate groups from ovalbumin using
CIP. In the case of deglycosylation, the generally used N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) for the cleavage of GlcNAc-Asn linkages
in denatured N-glycoproteins, thereby releasing the attached ensemble
of N-glycans, turned out to be ineffective for ovalbumin under native
conditions (data not shown). Probably the GlcNAc-Asn linkage is not
easily accessible in the ovalbumin native conformation. Inspection
of the crystal structure of uncleaved ovalbumin showed that the glycosylation
site N292 is located in the loop between an α helix and a β
strand.11 The GlcNAc-Asn292 linkage could
be tightly packed in the native ovalbumin conformation, making it
difficult for PNGase F to approach.

As we would like to avoid
denaturing conditions,12 we explored the
use of endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidases, and
we found that endo F1 was less sensitive to the ovalbumin conformation
and therefore more suitable for deglycosylation. Endo F1 releases
oligomannose- and hybrid-type N-glycans, provided that no intersecting
GlcNAc is present, generating an ovalbumin form with one GlcNAc residue
remaining on the Asn residue.13−15 In accordance with our experiments,
not all glycans were removed from the intact ovalbumin by Endo F1,
but we could use this enzyme specificity to assist our glycan assignments.

Analysis of Dephosphorylated and Deglycosylated Ovalbumin
We measured the (a) natural unprocessed, (b) deglycosylated, (c)
dephosphorylated, (d) deglycosylated and dephosphorylated ovalbumin
by native mass spectrometry using the modified Orbitrap Exactive.
The resulting four spectra are depicted in Figure 1 (panels a–d). Signals were averaged only for a few
minutes, consuming a few femtomole of sample. Whereas ESI under denaturing
conditions results in ovalbumin ions with charge states between [M
+ 18H]18+ and [M + 45H]45+ (Figure S-1b of the Supporting Information), ESI under native conditions
results in ovalbumin ions with signals primarily concentrated (over
95%) in only two charge states, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio
(S/N), reducing potential overlap between different species, and facilitating
convolution to a zero-charge mass spectrum. The high S/N ratio (∼11000)
in these spectra allows us to detect low abundant proteoforms next
to the highest abundant ones. Practically, the ratio in abundance
between the highest and lowest abundant assigned proteoforms was 800
(i.e., 0.1% relative to the base peak), a reasonable dynamic range
in terms of native MS.

Exactive
of (a) unprocessed, (b) deglycosylated, (c) dephosphorylated and (d)
deglycosylated and dephosphorylated ovalbumin from m/z 2000 to 6000. There are two series of proteoforms
present in the spectra displayed in (b) and (d) because the deglycosylation
is incomplete due to enzyme specificity of Endo F1. The inset shows
the crystal structure of chicken ovalbumin with the two reported phosphorylation
sites, the N-acetylated terminus and the glycosylation site annotated.

In Figure 2, we zoom in looking only at
the signals of the [M + 13H]13+ ions, with again (a) the
natural unprocessed, (b) deglycosylated, (c) dephosphorylated, (d)
deglycosylated and dephosphorylated ovalbumin. Focusing first on the
least composite spectrum of the deglycosylated and dephosphorylated
ovalbumin in Figure 2d, we can extract from
the most intense signal (at m/z 3300)
the ovalbumin protein polypeptide backbone mass, without the decoration
of glycosylation and phosphorylation. The mass of the polypeptide
backbone of ovalbumin can be derived from the DNA16 sequence to be 42750.19 Da. In our analysis after the removal
of glycans by Endo F1 and the phosphates by CIP, there are still an
N-acetylation (42.01 Da) and a GlcNAc residue (203.1950 Da) attached
to the polypeptide chain. The experimentally measured mass is 42995.35
Da, which deviates by only 1.23 ppm from the predicted mass, taking
these latter modifications into account (42995.28 Da). In Figure 2d, only a few other signals are observed, all of
which can be assigned. In agreement with previous studies, ovalbumin
is predominantly acetylated at the protein N-terminal;17 however, our data also indicate the presence
of a proteoform (42953.30 Da) lacking the N-acetylation (delta mass
42.05 Da), with a relative abundance of 6.20% compared to the N-acetylated
species. In accordance with literature,13 we found that not all glycans could be removed by Endo F1, resulting
in several residual ion signals around m/z 3420. The result is in agreement with the statement of
Endo F1 specificity, wherein high-mannose type (numbered 1, 2, 4,
and 8) and hybrid type (numbered 3, 5, and 9) glycans have been completely
released (cleavage GlcNAc–GlcNAc linkage), leaving hybrid-type
glycans with intersecting GlcNAc and complex-type di-, tri-, and tetra-antennary
structures (numbered 6, 7, 10–16, and 18–45).

Figure 2 Zoom in on
the [M + 13H]13+ charge state, native ESI-MS
spectra of (a) unprocessed, (b) deglycosylated, (c) dephosphorylated,
and (d) deglycosylated and dephosphorylated ovalbumin. From a comparison
of the spectra in (b) and (d), the two phosphorylation sites could
be confirmed. The average mass of the “naked” ovalbumin
polypeptide backbone (with N-acetylation, and one GlcNAc) determined
from the spectrum (d) is 42995.35 Da, within 1.23 ppm of the expected
mass (42995.29 Da). The abundance ratio between the maximum and minimum
detectable and assigned proteoforms is ∼800.

Analysis of Deglycosylated Ovalbumin
After deglycosylation
by Endo F1, the spectrum being presented in Figure 2b was recorded, wherein the number of coappearing proteoforms
is clearly reduced (compare Figure 2, panels
b and a), facilitating to extract data regarding the protein phosphorylation.
Around m/z 3320 in Figure 2b, two main ion signals are observed. Their corresponding
masses are 43075.35 and 43155.35 Da, a mass difference of 80.07 and
160.07 Da compared to the N-acetylated polypeptide backbone mass,
respectively. These data indicate that the major ovalbumin species
is diphosphorylated (77.3%), also with a quite abundant monophosphorylated
proteoform (21.6%). In addition, we found a low abundant species (1.1%)
corresponding to the nonphosphorylated ovalbumin. It is well-known
from literature that ovalbumin bears only two residues that are highly
phosphorylated (i.e., S68 and S344). Our results are quantitatively
reasonably consistent with earlier studies by SDS–PAGE, reporting
primarily diphosphorylation with monophosphorylation to be present
for ∼34%.18,19

Analysis of Dephosphorylated
Ovalbumin
After treatment
by CIP, the baseline resolved spectrum of dephosphorylated ovalbumin
displayed in Figure 2c presents ideal data
to dissect the variation in glycosylation, which is the main cause
of ovalbumin microheterogeneity. A comparison of the spectra of dephosphorylated
(Figure 2c) and unprocessed ovalbumin (Figure 2a) reveals a clear reduction in the numbers of proteoforms
caused by complete dephosphorylation. We calculated the mass of individual
glycan structures by subtracting 42995.35 Da (the mass of the deglycosylated
and dephosphorylated polypeptide backbone of ovalbumin) from each
identified glycoform, and the mass of one GlcNAc (203.19) and the
reduced N-terminus (18.01). Next, we constructed a mass difference
matrix to identify relationships between any two detected masses,
whereby an “exact” difference of one monosaccharide
(hexose/Hex, N-acetylhexosamine/HexNAc, deoxyhexose/dHex,
sialic acid/Sia) was considered a match. As is evident from Table 1, in total, an unprecedented number of 45 different
compositions, built up from Hex and HexNAc units supplemented a few
times with one or two Sia (= N-acetylneuraminic acid/Neu5Ac)
residues, could be detected and assigned with satisfying accuracy.
These glycan structures range in mass from about 1000 to 3500 Da and
consist of 6 to 19 monosaccharide moieties. We also quantified all
these glycoforms summing the ions signals over all observed charge
states (Table 1). For less than half, i.e.,
19 out of the 45 compositions (detected masses), glycan structures
have been previously annotated in chicken ovalbumin (Table 1). Among the remaining 26, we found 7 compositions
that fit reference structures as being reported for pigeon ovalbumin.20

Analysis of Unprocessed Ovalbumin
Evidently, it would
be advantageous to analyze the microheterogeneity of endogenous proteins,
avoiding the use of enzymes to cleave off some of the modifications,
as in any of these processes information or sample can get lost. Moreover,
the reproducibility of such procedures is not trivial. Obviously,
the mass spectrum of unprocessed ovalbumin (Figures 1a and 2a) represents the most complex
spectrum. In the spectra of unprocessed ovalbumin, we could readily
separate by mass and distinguish around 60 different proteoforms.
In Figure 3, we plotted as mirror images the
zero-charge convoluted spectra of natural unprocessed ovalbumin (in
blue) and dephosphorylated ovalbumin (in black). For a more clear
comparison, the spectrum of unprocessed ovalbumin was shifted by 160
Da to lower mass, so that the doubly phosphorylated peaks in unprocessed
ovalbumin align with their nonphosphorylated peaks in dephosphorylated
ovalbumin. In Figure 3, the smaller peaks (above
∼45000 Da) have been magnified by a factor of 10. Still they
represent based on their mass shifts (see Table 1) genuine structures that correspond to glycan structures but also
due to the fact that also these signals are responsive to the dephosphorylation
by CIP in an alike manner as the more abundant signals. In these images
all peaks that show reduced abundance or even disappear correspond
to phosphorylated proteoforms. A minor caveat is that we cannot easily
resolve the difference between two phosphorylations (160 Da) and one
hexose residue (162 Da), resulting in partial overlap of different
proteoforms. For example, in Figure 3, annotated
glycoform 8 can also be assigned to glycoform 10, bearing a single
phosphorylation on phosphorylation sites S68 or S344. After removal
of the phosphate groups, the relative abundance of peak 10 reduces,
indicating that this peak is most likely a mixture of two proteoforms:
one is diphosphorylated ovalbumin with glycan 8 on glycosylation site
N292, and the other is a singly phosphorylated ovalbumin bearing glycan
10. Such partial overlap could possibly induce the relatively large
mass deviations observed for some glycan structures in Table 1 (composition numbers 3, 12, 15, 16, 19, 21, 24,
27, 40, and 44). In summary, we profiled 59 different proteoforms
in natural unprocessed chicken ovalbumin, including 45 proteoforms
with different glycans, 13 monophosphorylated proteoforms, a few nonphosphorylated
proteoforms, and a few wherein the N-acetylation was missing. The
identified glycan masses ranged from about 1000 to 3500 Da, and their
relative intensities spanned about 2 orders.

Figure 3 Characterization of 59
proteoforms in chicken ovalbumin. (a) Variations
caused by the widespread glycosylation could be most easily identified
and assigned using the spectrum of dephosphorylated ovalbumin. By
comparing this spectrum in (a) to unprocessed ovalbumin in (b), proteoforms
with either one or two phosphorylation sites occupied could be detected
(with the single phosphorylated peaks annotated in purple). The proteoform
lacking N-terminal acetylation is marked as N* in pink. The signals
in the gray box are multiplied by a factor of 10 and highly enriched
in the less reported glycan structures. We hypothesize that several
of the complex-type glycans in the composition range 24–45
are in fact extensions of the well-established complex-type glycans
from the composition range 1–23, namely, with terminal Gal(α1–4)Gal
and polylactosamine units, in separated or mixed form.

Discussion
Qualitative and Semiquantitative
Analysis of Proteoforms of
Ovalbumin
The high-resolving power of the modified Exactive
Orbitrap mass analyzer at elevated m/z allows confident separation and mass assignment of all the coappearing
proteoforms in chicken ovalbumin, enabling qualitative structural
analysis from a single spectrum in a matter of minutes, consuming
only a few femtomoles of unprocessed analyte. Semiquantitative analysis
of ovalbumin PTMs, such as N-acetylation cleavages, phosphorylation,
and extensive glycosylation, are in satisfying agreement with previous
studies using classical analytical techniques such as SDS–PAGE,
CE, and MALDI-MS. Therefore, we consider our method based on high-resolution
mass spectrometry as a confident strategy for the characterization
of protein microheterogeneity. More than half of the identified proteoforms
are present below a 5% relative abundance. Direct analysis toward
these less-populated proteoforms would be much more difficult using
traditional techniques based on bottom-up proteome analysis and chromatography,
since information might be lost during the sample preparation, separation,
or detection process.

Benchmarking against Reported Literature
Over the past
decades, the N-glycosylation of chicken ovalbumin has been examined
by a plethora of analytical techniques, making it already, before
this study, one of the best-characterized glycoproteins.21−57 In fact, the glycoprotein has been quite often selected as a model
compound in the development of new strategies for the structural analysis
of N-glycosylation patterns, making use of chemically or enzymatically
released carbohydrate chains from denatured material. It should be
noted that in most studies commercially available ovalbumin preparations
have been used instead of highly purified samples. In view of this,
it has been reported that among the many assigned glycan structures
in the literature, several structures do not originate from ovalbumin
but from contaminating glycoproteins, such as ovomucoid,39,47,58−63 ovotransferrin,32,39 or riboflavin-binding protein.47,64,65 Although for our research we
have used commercial chicken ovalbumin (grade V), our data exclude
such possibilities; as by analyzing the intact glycoprotein instead
of the released glycans, we unambiguously link the observed glycan
compositional data to the ovalbumin polypeptide backbone. It should
be noted that in our analysis we did not observe any traces of ovomucoid
(28 kDa) or ovotransferrin (77 kDa), glycoproteins which should easily
be mass-resolved from ovalbumin. For the majority of the 45 compositions
in terms of SiaxHexyHexNAcz, as presented in Table 1, we have shown the translation into real glycan
structures based on Neu5Ac, Gal, Man, and GlcNAc, as available from
the literature, in Figure S-2 of the Supporting
Information. The symbolic notation of the N-glycan structures
and linkages are explained in Supporting Information, Figure S-3.
Most of the assigned structures are based on highly detailed previous
studies on chicken ovalbumin using methylation analysis in combination
with liquid chromatography/exoglycosidase digestions (composition
numbers 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 11, 14, 18, and 23),24−27,36 NMR spectroscopy (composition numbers 1, 2, 4, 6–8, 10–12,
14–16, and 18),29,31,32,34,35,39,42 two-dimensional (2D)
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in combination with
exoglycosidase digestions (composition numbers 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10,
11, 14, and 18),37 MALDI-TOF MS in combination
with exoglycosidase digestions, including NMR and enzymatic data of
earlier reports (composition numbers 1–12, 14–16, 18,
19, and 22),47 and detailed MS fragmentations
studies (composition numbers 5, 6, and 10).52 The references included in Table 1 and Figure
S-2 of the Supporting Information refer
to these original studies.

In a detailed study, Harvey et al.47 compared the structures of the released glycans
of commercial chicken ovalbumin (grade V) with those of HPLC-purified
chicken ovalbumin and gave a list of glycans, which in their opinion
were originating from contaminating glycoproteins. This holds especially
for tetra-antennae (2,4 and 2,6 branching) and penta-antennae (2,4
and 2,4,6 branching) with intersecting GlcNAc being found in ovomucoid58−63 and for some of the smaller structures. Their conclusion that the
glycans related to the composition numbers 1, 3, 16, 19, and 22 do
not belong to chicken ovalbumin is not in agreement with our findings.
However there is NMR proof for a penta-antennary structure with intersecting
GlcNAc for composition number 16 in chicken ovalbumin (grade V;42 it could be that this structure, like all the
other penta-antennary structures,47 belongs
to ovomucoid).58,59 With some exceptions, as mentioned
above, over the whole range our findings are consistent with the findings
of Harvey et al. in terms of glycan structures, mass distribution,
and even relative abundance. The five most abundant glycan structures
they observed (numbered 4, 8, 15, 19/20, and 25 in their Figure 3a)
also match the top 5 in our data (numbered 2, 4, 10, 14, and 18 in
Table 1). It should be mentioned that they
stated that the N-glycan profiles of the intact HPLC-purified chicken
ovalbumin, as studied by ESI-MS, and the released glycans matched
each other. Two earlier ESI-MS investigations on intact chicken ovalbumin
showed only a small part of the 45 compositions found in our study.
In the first study,41 the composition numbers
2, 4, 10, 13, 14, and 18 (Table 1) were identified,
and in the second study,49 the composition
numbers were 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, and 18 (Table 1) (the reported compositions Hex3HexNAc4 and Hex4HexNAc7 were not detected in
our study).

Inspection of the presented glycans with composition
numbers 1–23
(Table 1) confirmed the presence of oligomannose-type,
hybrid-type with and without intersecting GlcNAc, and complex-type
di-, tri- (2,4 or 2,6 branching), and tetra-antennary (2,4 and 2,6
branching) structures with intersecting GlcNAc. Inspection of the
remaining composition numbers 24–45, primarily heavier in mass
and more complex, accounting cumulatively for 4.1% of the total ion
intensity in the unprocessed ovalbumin mass spectra, showed for the
numbers 25, 27, 28, 30, 34, 37, and 44 a fit with glycan structures,
earlier reported for pigeon ovalbumin (Table 1).20 In the latter study, the assigned
structures have been estimated by FAB-MS and ESI-MS in combination
with methylation analysis and three-dimensional HPLC/exoglycosidase
digestions and are part of a series of N-glycans containing terminal
Gal(α1–4)Gal epitopes. These findings contradict previous
suggestions claiming the total absence of Gal(α1–4)Gal
entities in Galliformes (chicken).66 We
tried to confirm the Gal(α1–4)Gal structure using α(1–3,-4,-6)-galactosidase
from coffee bean, but this enzyme did not show any activity to intact
chicken ovalbumin under native conditions. Still, our data reveal
that it is highly likely that several Gal(α1–4)Gal glycan
structures in very minor amounts are present in chicken ovalbumin.
We believe they have not been reported before by other techniques
due to their very low relative abundance.

Another aspect, when
trying to convert compositions in the range
24–45 to glycan structures, is the high number of HexNAc units.
With a focus on composition number 36, Hex7HexNAc9 (i.e., Gal4Man3GlcNAc9), it is
clear that even suggesting penta-antennary (2,4 and 2,4,6 branching)
structures with intersecting GlcNAc, a repeating Gal(β1–4)GlcNAc
unit (polylactosamine type), should be present. Taking into account
that penta-antennary structures (with and without intersecting GlcNAc)
have been indicated not to belong to chicken ovalbumin, but for instance
to contaminating chicken ovomucoid,47 we
hypothesize that several of the complex-type glycans in the composition
range 24–45 are in fact extensions of the well-established
complex-type glycans from the composition range 1–23, namely,
with terminal Gal(α1–4)Gal and polylactosamine units,
in separated or mixed form (see, for example, hypothetical tri- and
tetra-antennary glycan structures with intersecting GlcNAc for composition
number 36 in Figure S-4 of the Supporting Information).

Strengths and Limitations of the Approach
Compared
to current analytical approaches for analyzing protein microheterogeneity,
for instance by chromatographic-based techniques (SCX, HILIC), gel
electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE, 2D gel), and capillary electrophoresis,
high-resolution native ESI-MS separates proteoforms based on their
mass. Our approach has some clear distinct advantages. First, it consumes
very little sample and time to obtain reliable information. Second,
it gives a panoramic view of all coappearing species, including low
abundant ones. Third, it excludes possible interference from copurified
contaminant proteins.

In contrast to classical glycan structure
studies, we electrospray the intact protein instead of the released
glycans or glycopeptides, measuring the mass shift between different
glycoforms on the intact polypeptide backbone. In this way, we significantly
reduce any bias induced by difference in the ionization efficiency
toward different sugar residues (for example, sialic acid). Furthermore,
incomplete digestion due to enzyme specificity is not a problem for
the glycan assignment. In this way, it is possible to preserve comprehensive
information even for lower abundant glycoforms. In principle, the
analysis presented here could also be done by ESI-MS on denatured
proteins, introduced into the mass spectrometer either by LC–MS
or direct infusion. Certainly, the resolution of the Orbitrap and
other FT mass analyzers is even higher in the lower m/z ranges, which is necessary to detect and resolve
the highly charged proteins. As discussed above, ovalbumin sprayed
from such a denaturing solution, typically used in MS, leads to a
very broad charge envelope ranging from [M + 18H]18+ to
[M + 45H]45+ (see Figure S-1 of the Supporting Information). The inherent disadvantages of using
denaturing conditions include the following: (a) it is less “native”
due to the loss of protein tertiary structure, (b) ion signals are
spread out over more species, which reduces S/N, and (c) all ion signals
appear in narrower m/z windows,
making undesirable overlap more likely.

An obvious disadvantage
of our strategy is that it is rather blind
in assessing monosaccharide stereoisomers, type of linkages, anomeric
configurations, and glycan branching, which still would require dedicated
glycan analysis by NMR spectroscopy, LC combined with exoglycosidases,
and methylation analysis or MS/MS.

Future Perspective
Protein microheterogeneity resulting
from genetic variants, RNA editing, cellular processing, or PTMs can
affect protein activity and stability, also in the case of recombinant
therapeutic proteins.67−69 Therefore, analysis of protein microheterogeneity
is crucial. Yet, it remains analytically challenging since it requires
high-resolution separation techniques. We foresee that native ESI-MS
using the modified Orbitrap Exactive high-resolution mass analyzer
will make a significant contribution to the field, as demonstrated
here by taking the prototypical endogenous protein ovalbumin as a
model case. One single native ESI-MS spectrum reveals the masses and
relative abundances of each co-occurring proteoform, providing a qualitative
and semiquantitative fingerprint spectrum. This will allow analysis
of any PTM (phosphorylation, glycosylation, lysine-acetylation, etc.)
at the intact protein level. These analyses are applicable to any
class of proteins and can complement typical top-down proteomics experiments.
Especially, kinases, oncogenes, and chromatin-related proteins are
known to be decorated by a plethora of functionally important PTMs,
leading to rather complex protein microheterogeneity. The achieved
high mass-resolving power and high mass accuracy allows for comprehensive,
in-depth, and detailed parallel characterization of various modifications,
contributing to our understanding of protein functioning in general.

Conclusions
Here, we present a new strategy to analyze protein
microheterogeneity.
Using a modified Orbitrap Exactive mass analyzer, we performed native
MS experiments on intact chicken ovalbumin. An unprecedented number
of around 60 proteoforms could be distinguished and baseline separated
by mass. After enzymatic removal of part of the glycan chains and/or
phosphate groups from intact ovalbumin, the microheterogeneity reduced
extensively. All identified proteoforms, could not only be detected
but also assigned and semiquantified. When structural data were available,
our assignments were in good agreement with the literature. Furthermore,
we also identified and assigned more than 20 previously unreported
new glycan structures, providing evidence suggesting the existence
of Gal(α1–4)Gal and polylactosamine type units, revealing
novel aspects in the glycobiology of chicken ovalbumin.
