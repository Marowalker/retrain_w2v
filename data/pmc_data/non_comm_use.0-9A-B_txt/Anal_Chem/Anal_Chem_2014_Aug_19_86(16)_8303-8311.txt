A novel MALDI-FTICR imaging mass
spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) workflow
is described for on-tissue detection, spatial localization, and structural
confirmation of low abundance bioactive ceramides and other sphingolipids.
Increasingly, altered or elevated levels of sphingolipids, sphingolipid
metabolites, and sphingolipid metabolizing enzymes have been associated
with a variety of disorders such as diabetes, obesity, lysosomal storage
disorders, and cancer. Ceramide, which serves as a metabolic hub in
sphingolipid metabolism, has been linked to cancer signaling pathways
and to metabolic regulation with involvement in autophagy, cell-cycle
arrest, senescence, and apoptosis. Using kidney tissues from a new
Farber disease mouse model in which ceramides of all acyl chain lengths
and other sphingolipid metabolites accumulate in tissues, specific
ceramides and sphingomyelins were identified by on-tissue isolation
and fragmentation, coupled with an on-tissue digestion by ceramidase
or sphingomyelinase. Multiple glycosphingolipid species were also
detected. The newly generated library of sphingolipid ions was then
applied to MALDI-IMS of human lung cancer tissues. Multiple tumor
specific ceramide and sphingomyelin species were detected and confirmed
by on-tissue enzyme digests and structural confirmation. High-resolution
MALDI-IMS in combination with novel on-tissue ceramidase and sphingomyelinase
enzyme digestions makes it now possible to rapidly visualize the distribution
of bioactive ceramides and sphingomyelin in tissues.

==== Body
Sphingolipids
are a class of
membrane biomolecules that include ceramides, sphingomyelins, sphingosine-1-phosphate
(S-1-P), and glycosphingolipids, all of which are important for maintaining
cell integrity and signal transduction processes.1−3 Consequently,
altered or elevated levels of sphingolipids, sphingolipid metabolites,
and sphingolipid metabolizing enzymes have been associated with a
variety of disorders such as diabetes, obesity, lysosomal storage
disorders, and cancer.1−14 Ceramides, which serve as a metabolic hub in sphingolipid metabolism,
have been linked to cancer signaling pathways, a connection manifest
by their involvement in autophagy, cell-cycle arrest, senescence,
and apoptosis.1,2,8,9 While ceramides are pro-apoptotic in tumor
cells, S-1-P, a ceramide metabolite, is antiapoptotic and promotes
tumorigenesis.1−3,15−17

The levels of ceramide, sphingosine, and S-1-P are maintained
by
five distinct ceramidases, one of which is acid ceramidase (ACDase).
These enzymes cleave ceramides into fatty acids and sphingosine, which
in turn can be phosphorylated to the antiapoptotic (S-1-P) metabolite
by sphingosine kinase.1,18 Because ACDase regulates the
balance of pro (ceramides) versus antiapoptotic (S-1-P) metabolites,
it is not surprising that ACDase overexpression is a hallmark of many
cancers.2,4,18,19 Likewise in prostate, pancreatic, and nonsmall cell
lung carcinomas (NSCLC), ACDase overexpression, and lower levels of
intracellular ceramide, have also been linked to chemo- and radiation
resistance, thus establishing ACDase as a potential therapeutic target.3,4,15,19−21 Importantly, well-established cancer drugs such as
tamoxifen and carmofur have recently been found to modulate ACDase
expression and directly inhibit its activity.22,23 This suggests that the efficacy of these drugs is dependent on manipulation
of ceramides; thus, anticancer therapies could be enhanced by targeting
ceramide metabolism.3,4,15,17,22−24 These findings highlight the importance of ceramide metabolism in
cancer pathogenesis and the need for novel methods to identify and
detect these species within cancer tissues.

Currently, liquid
chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is the
standard method used to identify sphingolipids within tissue; however,
it confers no localization component relative to the histopathology
of the tissue.25,26 Conversely, MALDI imaging mass
spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) offers the distinct ability to spatially
profile the distribution of a specific ion across a tissue of interest,
linking the localization of the ion to the histopathology of the tissue.27,28 Although it was initially developed to spatially profile proteins
and peptides within tissues,29−32 the variety of species that can now be imaged has
greatly increased. Incorporation of high resolution Fourier transform
ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) MALDI mass spectrometry instruments
in imaging workflows has facilitated detection of unique and lower
abundance classes of positively and negatively charged lipids, N-linked
glycans, drug compounds, and metabolites.33−40 While MALDI tissue imaging studies have been used to profile abundant
lipid species across different tissue types,10,33−38,41 a definitive and comprehensive
structural and tissue distribution analysis of bioactive ceramides
and other important sphingolipids has not been reported, possibly
due to their very low levels and to challenges in verifying their
identity.

In this study, a workflow to profile ceramides was
developed and
validated in kidney tissues from an acid ceramidase-deficient mouse
model (Asah1P361R/P361R) of Farber disease, which has significant
accumulations of ceramides in various tissues.12 Detection of ceramide and sphingomyelin species was validated
by structural fragmentation, comparison to standards, and on-tissue
digestions with exogenous ceramidase or sphingomyelinase for ceramide
and sphingomyelin species. The same strategy was applied to image
and identify tumor-specific ceramides and other sphingolipids in matched
nontumor and nonsmall cell lung carcinoma tissues (NSCLC). Defining
these ceramide and sphingomyelin species further allowed identification
of dehydroceramide, hydroxyceramide, and glycosphingolipid species.
The data demonstrate the potential of using high-resolution MALDI-IMS
to identify sphingolipid biomarkers related to human disorders of
metabolism and cancers.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Ceramide
lipid standards were purchased from
Avanti-Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL). 2,5-Dihydroxybenzioc acid
(DHB) and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO). HPLC-grade methanol (MeOH), ethanol, and water were
obtained from Fisher Scientific. Indium tin oxide (ITO) slides were
purchased from Bruker for MALDI-IMS experiments. Recombinant bCDase
and bSMase were expressed and purified as previously described.20

Animal Model and Tissues
A single
nucleotide mutation
found in a patient was introduced into the murine Asah1 gene (Asah1P361R/P361R) to generate a knock-in model
of Farber disease.12 Further details of
the generation and characterization of this Farber disease model are
described in Alayoubi et al.12 Animals
were maintained under an ACC-approved protocol at the University Health
Network in Toronto. Whole excised kidneys from 9 week-old euthanized
animals were placed in weigh-boats and rapidly frozen with liquid
nitrogen in the vapor phase for 2 min and placed directly in liquid
nitrogen for 30 s. Mouse kidneys were stored at −80 °C
until sectioning. Tissues were sectioned (10 μm) with a Thermo
Microm HM550 cryostat. For each section analyzed, a serial section
was collected for histological analysis and staining with hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E). Human noncancer and nonsmall cell lung carcinoma
tissues were collected under IRB approved and patient consented protocols
in the Department of Surgery at MUSC and registered in the Hollings
Cancer Center Biorepository and Tissue Analysis Resource. Samples
were deidentified to the laboratory investigators.

MALDI Imaging
Mass Spectrometry
Sectioned mouse kidney
tissue samples were mounted on ITO coated slides and desiccated at
room temperature for 20 min. An ImagePrep spray station (Bruker Daltonics)
was used to coat the slide with a 0.2 mL solution containing 8 mU
of the bCDase or 2 mU of the bSMase enzyme. This solution was sprayed
by the ImagePrep using settings originally optimized for spraying
trypsin. These settings result in minimal volumes and retention of
spatial distribution. Control tissue slices were blocked with a glass
slide during the spraying process. Following enzyme application, slides
were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in a humidified chamber and dried
in a desiccator prior to matrix application. DHB matrix at a concentration
of 0.2 M in 50% MeOH and 0.01% TFA was sprayed onto the slide using
the ImagePrep for analysis in positive ion mode. Spectra were acquired
across the entire tissue section on a Solarix dual source 7T FTICR
mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) to detect the lipid species of
interest (m/z 200–2000) with
a SmartBeam II laser operating at 1000 Hz, a laser spot size of 25
μm, and a raster width of 200 μm for general profiling
or 75 μm for high resolution images. For each laser spot, 800
spectra were averaged. Images of differentially expressed lipids were
generated using FlexImaging 4.0 software (Bruker Daltonics). Following
MS analysis, data was loaded into FlexImaging Software focusing on
the m/z range of 200–2000
and reduced to 0.98 ICR Reduction Noise thresholds. All data was normalized
using root means square,42 and intensities
were normalized to each other per figure as indicated in the figure
legends.

Continuous Accumulation of Selected Ions and Collision-Induced
Dissociation
Continuous accumulation of selected ions/collision-induced
dissociation (CASI/CID) fragmentation was done with reference standards
spotted on a MALDI plate with DHB matrix or directly off tissue. CASI
allows for trapping of a specific ion of interest within the quadrupole
of the Solarix 7T FTICR mass spectrometer. Following accumulation,
the selected ion was fragmented using CID. Structural assignments
were made following detection of specific fragmentation patterns and
cross-validated with the Lipid Maps database.

Quantitation of Ceramides
Ceramide levels of tissue
lysates from 9 week-old Farber mice were determined using LC-MS/MS
as described previously.43

Results
MALDI
Imaging Mass Spectrometry of Tissue Ceramides
To develop
a systemic approach to profile the distribution of low
abundance ceramide species in tissues, a novel and established mouse
model of Farber disease that expresses variant ACDase homozygous Asah1P361R/P361R was used.12 This model mimics Farber disease in the accumulation of
ceramide species of varying chain lengths in tissues and in clinical
features.12 Kidneys were chosen as a starting
material because they are affected by Farber disease and they offer
suitable histopathological detail in regards to MALDI-IMS experiments.
Ceramides are a central hub in sphingolipid metabolism, as summarized
in Figure 1, and we hypothesized that these
Farber model kidneys could contain all of the major and minor metabolites.
Kidneys from wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mice were collected,
frozen, and sectioned at 10 μm and thaw-mounted on ITO-coated
glass slides. Sections were either sprayed with DHB matrix and analyzed
by MALDI-IMS for lipid analysis or subjected to enzyme digestions
prior to analysis (Supplemental Figure 1a, Supporting
Information). Separate serial sections of each kidney were
stained with H&E (Figure 2a and Supplemental
Figure 1b, Supporting Information) for
comparison. A variety of ceramide species with acyl chain lengths
of C16–C24 and multiple counterions (H+, Na+, or K+) were detected
primarily in the homozygous Asah1P361R/P361R kidneys (Figure 2b; Supplemental Table 1, Supporting Information), relative to heterozygote
and control kidneys, and varied in chain length for each species by
28 mass units. The detected masses are also consistent with a small
number of ceramide species detected by MALDI-IMS in human adrenal
gland tissues.34 The ceramide species detected
along with their relative intensity levels were consistent with the
total concentration levels of the same kidney ceramides as determined
from tissue lysates by LC-MS/MS (Figure 2c).
Ion suppression and variation across tissue sections or matrix affects
can be problematic in MALDI imaging experiments; thus, data was normalized
using root mean squares optimal for MALDI-FTICR data.42

Further, linking the histopathology of the Asah1P361R/P361R kidney (Figure 3a)
to the imaging data shows the distinct distribution of ceramide species.
A high-resolution MALDI image of the Farber kidney is included that
documents the presence of sphingosine-1-phosphate and two ceramide-1-phosphates
(C16:0 and C22:0) (Figure 3b) along with two
ceramide species detected primarily in the kidney medulla (C18:0)
(Figure 3c, panel 2) or cortex (C16:0 and C24:1)
(Figure 3c, panel 1, 3). An example of a hydroxyceramide
species (C24:1) is shown in Figure 3c, panel
4. Differential ceramide distribution within the Farber kidney is
especially evident in the overlay images of the different species
(Figure 3d) and also include two species of
monohexose-ceramides (C24:0 and C26:0).

three panels. The fourth panel is a hydroxyceramide. (d) Colocalization
of different ceramides are shown in the first three panel overlays.
An overlay of two hexosylceramides is shown in the fourth panel. All
ions were normalized to the same intensities.

Initially, structural assignment of the ceramides was performed
on the basis of accurate masses and cross-referenced to the LIPID
MAPS database (http://www.lipidmaps.org/). In order to
verify that the species being detected were all ceramides as indicated,
it was necessary to demonstrate that the compounds being profiled
remained intact during the laser desorption ionization process. This
was accomplished using a panel of sphingolipid standards representing
different ceramides, sphingosine-1-phosphate, ceramide-1-phosphate,
sphingomyelins, and glycosphingolipids (Supplemental Figure 2a–i, Supporting Information). These standards were
spotted on a steel MALDI plate with DHB matrix and analyzed using
the Bruker Solarix 70T FTICR mass spectrometer. For comparison, the
same standards were measured on a separate MALDI instrument, a Bruker
AutoFlex III MALDI-TOF/TOF in linear and reflectron modes. Use of
the FTICR instrument readily identified the expected parent masses
of each sphingolipid standard. Continuous accumulation of selected
ions/collision-induced dissociation (CASI/CID) fragmentation further
confirmed the expected structural components, in particular detection
of an ion at m/z = 264 that is the
sphingoid base common to all sphingolipid species. Identification
of this 264 ion as a component of ceramide species previously has
been reported.6,25 Fragmentation of sphingomyelins
produced CID patterns characterized by the loss of their phosphocholine
headgroup (Supplemental Figure 1d, Supporting
Information); fragmentation of sphingosine-1-phosphate demonstrated
loss of phosphate (Supplemental Figure 2e, Supporting
Information), and for glycosphingolipids (Supplemental Figure
2f,g, Supporting Information), fragmentation
was accompanied by loss of the intact glycans. The corresponding linear
and reflectron spectra generated by the MALDI-TOF were less robust,
with frequent dehydroxylation of the parent molecule and other fragmentations.
Retaining the intact glycolipids and other standards reflect the high-pressure
collisional cooling condition following MALDI ionization that is used
in the Bruker Solarix FTICR mass spectrometer.44−46 Following this
experiment, ceramides with fatty acyl chain lengths from C12–C26
were directly isolated from Farber kidney tissue by CASI/CID. This
allowed simultaneous capture and enrichment of selected ceramide species,
followed by CID fragmentation and detection of the confirmatory sphingoid
base ion at 264.1. Representative capture and fragmentation spectra
the different ceramides in tissue are provided in Supplemental Figure
3a–h, Supporting Information.

On-Tissue Ceramidase Digestion
While CASI/CID is an
accurate method for on-tissue confirmation of ceramide structures,
these species exist in a background of more abundant sphingomyelin
and glycerophospholipids present in tissues at similar masses that
can affect isolation and CID identification of each potential ceramide
of interest. In order to more quickly and definitively identify ceramide
species in tissues, we incorporated an on-tissue digestion of ceramides
in kidney tissues with recombinant bacterial ceramidase from Pseudomonas aeroginosa (bCDase)20 prior to MALDI-IMS (Figure 4a). Action of
bCDase produces a sphingosine and a fatty acid (Figure 4b). Kidneys from wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous Farber
mice were sectioned in duplicate, with half of the slide sprayed with
bCDase at a concentration of 8 mU and the other half covered by a
glass slide as a control (Figure 4a). As expected,
the treated tissues showed a decrease in Farber-specific ceramide
species ions compared to nontreated tissues (Figure 4a). As expected, the glycosphingolipid species were not sensitive
to ceramidase, as illustrated by a monohexose-ceramide (C24:1+K),
nor were glycerophospholipids like the shown phosphatidylcholine PC
(34:0) (Figure 4d).

were sectioned and placed as mirror images on an ITO coated slide.
The tissues on the left part of the slide were covered while the right
half was sprayed with bCDase. Following MALDI-IMS, all intensities
were normalized to each other at 60%. (b) bCDase cleavage produces
a sphingosine and a fatty acid. (c) Lack of ceramidase cleavage is
shown for an example hexosylceramide and phosphatidylcholine to demonstrate
enzyme specificity.

A known feature of Farber
disease is also the accumulation of hydroxylated
ceramide species.47 From the same bCDase
digestion, ions corresponding to hydroxlated ceramides were detected
in the Farber tissues (Supplemental Figure 4a,b, Supporting Information). Additionally, these species decreased
following bCDase digestion (Supplemental Figure 4c, Supporting Information), and their identities correlated with
the LC-MS/MS data of kidney homogenates (Supplemental Figure 4d, Supporting Information) and clinical data.14 Overall, the bCDase digestion provided a rapid
enzymatic biochemical verification of global ceramide expression within
the tissues, and all identified ceramides are included (Supplemental
Table 1, Supporting Information).

Sphingomyelin
Identification and Sphingomyelinase
Less
is known about the heterogeneity of sphingomyelin (SM) species expression
in Farber disease; thus, their distributions were also assessed in
the same kidney tissues. Farber kidneys were sectioned, H&E stained
(Figure 5a), and analyzed. Results suggest
that a SM (d18:1/16:0) species is uniformly detected across the three
kidneys (Figure 5b) while the longer chain
SM (d18:2/24:1) was elevated in the Farber tissues. Similar to the
bCDase digestions, an analogous on-tissue digestion with an exogenous
bacterial sphingomyelinase (bSMase) from Bacillus cereus was performed. bSMase releases phosphocholine and ceramide as products
(Figure 5c), and the resulting ceramide therefore
will differ from the parent SM by a phosphocholine headgroup (184
mass units). As shown in Figure 5d, the left
side of the section was treated with 2mU bSMase and showed a decrease
in SM concentration. The cleavage product produced from digestion
can also be seen in the treated tissues in the right panel (Figure 5d). Levels of a phosphatidylcholine (C38:0) species
were included to show enzyme specificity across the tissues, and the m/z values of the sphingomyelin species
identified are listed in Supplemental Table 1, Supporting Information.

(d) For the bSMase digestion, kidneys were sectioned and placed as
mirror images on an ITO coated slide. The tissues on the left side
of the slide were sprayed with enzyme while the right side was an
unsprayed control.

Analysis of Nonsmall Cell
Lung Carcinoma Tissues
To
implement these techniques in a true discovery mode in the context
of human cancers, we next analyzed tissues derived from human nonsmall
cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC). A squamous tumor and normal tissue from
a subject with NSCLC were sectioned (Figure 6a), and the same ceramide and SM workflow was applied, with and without
bCDase and bSMase digestions. As expected, overall endogenous ceramide
levels were noticeably lower in these tissue sections and difficult
to detect by MALDI-IMS. However, two ceramide species (d18:1/12:0+K
and d18:0/20:0+Na) were detected at elevated levels in only the NSCLC
tissue (Figure 6b). The structures of these
ceramides were confirmed using CID and bCDase enzyme digestions (Figure 6c; Supplementary Figure 2, Supporting
Information). Two hexosylceramides (HexCer d18:1/22:1 and d18:1/24:1)
were also detected at elevated levels in the NSCLC tissue. The presence
of the more abundant sphingomyelins was also assessed (Figure 6e), and two species (d18:1/16:0 and d18:0/20:0)
were also elevated in the tumor. Another SM (d18:1/18:0) showed equal
distribution across both tissues. The structures were confirmed by
CID and bSMase digestion (Figure 6f; Supplemental
Figure 5a–d, Supporting Information).

digestion decreased levels of the detected sphingomyelins.

Discussion
The combination of a
unique Farber disease model with on-tissue
enzymatic and CID structural confirmation facilitated development
of a novel and comprehensive MALDI-IMS workflow to identify and visualize
multiple low-abundance sphingolipid metabolites directly in tissue
sections. Tandem liquid chromatography mass spectrometry has been
the gold standard in identifying and quantifying sphingolipid species
derived from tissue samples. However, it cannot provide the spatial
distribution and localization of these species within the tissues
of interest, which increasingly is critical to know when assigning
signal transduction functions to specific sphingolipid species. MALDI-IMS
imaging directly provides the capability of simultaneously profiling
the distribution of all detectable sphingolipids within a given tissue,
complementing the quantitative data obtained with LC-MS. The central
role of ceramides in sphingolipid metabolism (Figure 1) made these molecules the primary target for initial characterization;
as once their respective masses could be defined, the blueprint for
characterizing the other metabolites was available. Starting with
tissues derived from a Farber disease mouse model in which all ceramide
species accumulate was a crucial component, essentially serving as
a biological tissue standard. Multiple ceramide, ceramide phosphate,
glucosylceramides, and sphingomyelin species were detected, as well
as sphingosine-1-phosphate. Structural information such as fatty acyl
chain length and degree of saturation was also obtained. Distributions
of each of the ceramide and sphingomyelin species within the tissues
were then directly linked to their localization within the cortex
and medulla regions of the Farber kidney tissue. Addition of upfront
on-tissue digestions with bCDase proved beneficial when confirming
ceramide and hydroxylated ceramide identities. The bCDase and bSMase
incorporation also provides a rapid way to generate a quick global
view for detection of the abundance and distribution of ceramides
and sphingomyelins of interest, while also providing enzymatic-based
biochemical structural verifications.

The workflow optimized
in the Farber experiments was then successfully
applied to tissues derived from nonsmall cell lung carcinomas. Tumor-specific
ceramides and sphingomyelins could be readily detected, identified,
and correlated to specific tissue locations. Knowing the distribution
and identity of ceramides and sphingomyelins within tumor tissue samples
could be useful in addressing many questions concerning the role of
ceramides and sphingomyelins in cancer initiation and progression.
For example, does ceramide acyl chain length or saturation modulate
cancer progression? If so, could these structural characteristics
be used to develop new cancer diagnostics?13,48 Furthermore, because these biomolecules are assessable now at the
tissue level, it can be determined whether the elevation of a ceramide
species is specific to an individuals’ tumor or more generalizable
to NSCLC or other subtypes. If their concentrations change with treatment
as determined in tissues, it could also be feasible to monitor these
changes as potential therapeutic biomarkers in matched patient biofluids.

High-resolution imaging could also be beneficial in understanding
how anticancer drugs modify ceramide metabolism. For example, tamoxifen
and carmofur, which are currently used in anticancer treatment, were
recently found to inhibit acid ceramidase activity.22,23 These findings suggest a new role for these drugs within cancer
therapies focused on targeting ceramide metabolism, and as such, their
effects on ceramide metabolism could be measured using MALDI-IMS approaches.
Tumor chemoresistance is also a formidable challenge facing clinicians
in designing cancer treatments. Accordingly, combination therapies
that include targeting of sphingolipid metabolism are being assessed
to resensitize drug-resistant tumor cells.4,18,19,21−24,49,50 This has recently been demonstrated in NSCLC tumors which often
acquire resistance to choline kinase α (ChoKα) inhibitor
therapy specifically due to an elevation of acid ceramidase. Interestingly,
when an acid ceramidase inhibitor was administered with the ChoKα
inhibitor, resistance did not occur.19 Implementation
of MALDI-IMS studies within these workflows could help identify specific
ceramide species which predict tumor resistance.

The imaging
methods established herein are feasible for any fresh-frozen
tissue samples, and similar approaches can be done to identify the
distribution of more complex glycosphingolipids in tissues. As demonstrated,
this is possible due to the use of the Solarix MALDI-FTICR mass spectrometer,
which applies a high pressure collisional cooling condition after
MALDI ionization that preserves the intact glycolipid.44−46 A similar strategy could be applied using other lysosomal storage
disease models that accumulate distinct glycosphingolipid species,
for example, Gaucher disease and glucosylceramides or Fabry disease
and globotrioasylceramides. In combination with on-tissue application
of their corresponding degradative enzymes and MALDI-IMS, the approach
could effectively identify and generate a database of target glycosphingolipid
structures. The database and degradative enzymes could in turn be
used for analysis of other tissues, other glycosphingolipids, and
charged sulfated galactosylceramides (i.e, sulfatides51). In conclusion, novel MALDI-IMS workflows such as those
established herein offer a new approach to aid in visualizing and
deciphering the role of sphingolipids in lysosomal storage diseases,
cancer, and other disorders.
