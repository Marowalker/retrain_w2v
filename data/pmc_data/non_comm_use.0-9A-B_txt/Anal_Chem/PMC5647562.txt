Human
tissues are an important link between organ-specific spatial
molecular information, patient pathology, and patient treatment options.
However, patient tissues are uniquely obtained by time and location,
and limited in their availability and size. Currently, little knowledge
exists about appropriate and simplified protocols for routine MS-based
analysis of the various types and sizes of tissues. Following standard
procedures used in pathology, we selected small fresh frozen uterine
tissue samples to investigate how the tissue preparation protocol
affected the subsequent proteomics analysis. First, we observed that
protein extraction with 0.1% SDS followed by extraction with a 30%
ACN/urea resulted in a decrease in the number of identified proteins,
when compared to extraction with 30% ACN/urea only. The decrease in
the number of proteins was approximately 55% and 20%, for 10 and 16
μm thick tissue, respectively. Interestingly, the relative abundance
of the proteins shared between the two methods was higher when SDS/ACN/urea
was used, compared to the 30% ACN/urea extraction, indicating the
role of SDS to be beneficial for protein solubility. Second, the influence
of tissue thickness was investigated by comparing the results obtained
for 10, 16, and 20 μm thick (1 mm2) tissue using
urea/30% ACN. We observed an increase in the number of identified
proteins and corresponding quantity with an increase in the tissue
thickness. Finally, by analyzing very small amounts of tissues (∼0.2
mm2) of 10, 16, and 20 μm thickness, we observed
that the increase in tissue thickness resulted in a higher number
of protein identifications and corresponding quantitative values.

==== Body
The increasing
relevance of
proteomics for clinical research looms as national and international
funding schemes focus on bringing innovative technologies closer to
patients and their treatment options. This has spurred widespread
interest among researchers who now aim to provide detailed molecular
information on patient material, with the ambition to assist clinicians
directly and/or convert patient tissues to “digital information”
for subsequent investigation. To be successful, proteomics requires
biochemical procedures that routinely and simply convert tissues to
MS measurable material. The methods must be reliable and robust with
reproducibility as a key performance indicator.

Human organs
can contain the pathological condition of the patient,
and therefore, the analysis of tissues, including subsections of tissues,
can be of high relevance for clinicians aiming to treat or investigate
patients based on their molecular profile. However, proteomics of
tissues is not routinely employed. Clinical tissue samples are still
mostly stored for future research and are archived as formalin-fixed
paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues and to a much lesser extent as fresh
frozen (FF) tissues. FFPE is a routine method for tissue preservation
and has existed for more than a century. Long-term storage of FFPE
tissues at room temperature makes them readily available for use from
repositories compared to FF tissues stored in freezers. However, during
formalin fixation, proteins in FFPE tissues undergo chemical modifications
and extensive cross-linking. Studies aimed at measuring differences
from paired FFPE and FF tissues have revealed that a larger number
of proteins can be identified from FF tissues and that 40–90%
of the identified proteins are observed in both FF and FFPE tissues.1 Therefore, preferred samples for clinical proteomics
are still FF tissues, when available.

Sample preparation is
a key step in proteomics and several methodologies
such as single-pot solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (SP3),2 in-stage tip technology,3,4 or
FASP5−11 have been reported for preparing tissue for subsequent MS analysis.
We and others have also investigated mechanical disruption methods
to extract proteins from tissues for subsequent MS analysis. Some
of these include ultrasonication,12,13 picosecond
infrared lasers (PIRL),14 and pressure
cycling technology (PCT).15

A challenge
to efficiently extract proteins from cells using chemical
buffers is to ensure the proteins remain in-solution for subsequent
digestion. To achieve this, the addition of components such as chaotropes,
detergents, salts, and/or organic solvents are often used in the extraction
buffer.16 Chaotropes as urea and guanidine
hydrochloride facilitate protein denaturation and unfolding in-solution
by influencing protein structure and stability. Urea-based buffers
are widely used in tissue proteomics;17−21 however, the presence of high concentrations of urea
can interfere with the later digestion step, and therefore, it needs
to be diluted before the addition of trypsin.22 Moreover, it has been shown that presence of the urea can lead to
carbamylation of amino and sulfhydryl groups and further modify lysine
and arginine residues.23−25 Therefore, cyanate scavengers such as ammonium bicarbonate,
methylamine, and TrisHCl are sometimes added to extraction buffers.23,26 The addition of organic solvents such as ACN and MeOH can alter
protein conformation and facilitates their denaturation and subsequent
digestion. The optimal concentration of the ACN for protein extraction
varies between methods and has been reported in the range of 20–80%.27−31 Detergents are often added to the extraction buffers to improve
extraction efficiency and protein solubilization. The most commonly
used detergent is sodium dodecylsulfonate (SDS).32−34 SDS has been
used for a long time as a component of buffers for protein extraction,
however, as it is not compatible with MS due to ionization suppression,
it must be removed from the sample using variety of methods including
precipitation with ethyl acetate, trifluoroethanol (TFE), acetone,
KCl, or spin columns.38−41 Besides SDS, nonionic (Triton-X100, NP-40, Brij) or zwitterionic
(CHAPS) surfactants have also been used for processing of tissue samples.
However, to avoid possible interferences from the surfactants and
enable direct sample processing for MS, acid-labile detergents have
been developed. The advantage of these compounds, which include Rapigest,
MasDes, or ProteaseMax,42−45 is that they contain an acid-labile functional group
and upon hydrolysis break down into innocuous MS compounds. However,
sometimes these compounds are not as effective in protein extraction
as SDS. Another disadvantage limiting their widespread uptake is their
cost. A summary of some protocols reported for protein extraction
from the biological materials using urea, SDS, MS-compatible detergents
and other components present in extraction buffers is presented in Table 1. From this table,
we see that different sample preparation protocols result in a diversity
of protein recoveries, whereas the lytic strength (urea, detergent)
or procedures for removal of noncompatible MS compounds showed to
be most critical part in evaluation of procedures.

The composition of the extraction buffer has a critical effect
on which proteins may be detected. Due to the complexity of biological
samples, methods evaluated as successful on model proteins or cell
lines may be unsuccessful when analyzing tissues. The aim of our study
was to examine several simple nonmechanical protocols for extraction
and digestion of proteins from fresh frozen human uterus tissue. Protocols
varied in their extraction and digestion procedure, use of detergent,
and composition of the extraction solvent. We report the development
and evaluation of relevant questions for proteomics analysis of uterus
tissue: (1) Is SDS required for optimal and reproducible solubilization
of proteins from tissues? (2) How does the size and thickness of a
tissue relate to protein recovery? In this context, we analyzed small
amounts of 10, 16, and 20 μm thick FF uterus tissues. We examined
the influence of the sample preparation procedure on overall information
and results were related to the different sizes of the tissues.

Materials
and Methods
Materials and Reagents
Water (ULC/MS), acetonitrile
(ACN, LC-MS grade), and formic acid (FA) were purchased from Biosolve
(Valkenswaard, The Netherlands) and NH4HCO3 was
obtained by Fluka (Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands). Acetone, urea, sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS, ≥ 98.5%), dithiothreitol (DTT, ≥
99%), iodoacetamide (IAA, ≥ 99%), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA,
≥ 99%), and trypsin (European Pharmacopoeia reference standard)
were delivered by Sigma-Aldrich (Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands).

Fresh Frozen Tissue Samples
Cryosectioned fresh frozen
(FF) tissues of smooth muscle from uterus were provided by Leiden
University Medical Centre (LUMC, The Netherlands). Tissue sections
of 10, 16, and 20 μm were cut from the tissue block, placed
on the glass slide, and stored at −80 °C until used.

Fresh Frozen Uterus Tissue Preparation for LC-MS
Regions
of tissue were cut with a scalpel (Martor KG, Germany), and tissue
sections were then scraped from the glass slide into the extraction
buffer. Area of each individual tissue section was measured using
ImageJ software (version 1.49). All experiments were performed in
triplicate.

Following removal of tissues from the glass slide,
proteins were extracted using the different extraction buffers: (1)
solution containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 8), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1%
SDS was added, and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min.
After incubation 400 μL of 80% acetone was added, samples were
vortexed for 1 min and incubated for 1 h. After incubation, samples
were centrifuged at 12 000g for 20 min, and the supernatant
was discarded. Further, proteins were solubilized by using 100 μL
of solution containing of 30% ACN, 100 mM NH4HCO3, 8 M urea, and 19.6 mM DTT. Samples were further incubated for 30
min at 37 °C; (2) 30% ACN, 100 mM NH4HCO3, 8 M urea, and 19.6 mM DTT, and samples were incubated for 30 min
at 37 °C; (3) 60% ACN, 100 mM NH4HCO3,
8 M urea, and 19.6 mM DTT, and samples were incubated for 30 min at
37 °C. Following incubation, in each sample, 9.2 μL of
700 mM IAA was added, and the samples were alkylated for 1 h in the
dark at room temperature.

Following alkylation, 120 μL
of 1M NH4HCO3 and 880 μL of H2O were added to the samples.
Samples were vortexed, and trypsin was added at 5 ng/mm246 of the tissue, whereupon the samples
were left to digest. In Protocols 1, 2, and 4, proteins were digested
overnight (18 h) at 37 °C with constant shaking. In Protocols
3 and 5, following 18 h of digestion, a second portion of trypsin
was added, and samples were incubated for an additional 4 h (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Schematic overview of
the current study. (a) 10, 16, and 20 μm
thick FF human uterus tissue were used in the study. (b) Proteins
from the tissues were extracted using 3 different solutions varied
by detergent (SDS) and organic solvent (ACN). (c) Protein digestion
was performed over 18 h using a single portion of trypsin (Protocols
1, 2, and 4) or for an additional 4 h after the addition of second
portion of trypsin (Protocols 3 and 5).

After digestion, samples were centrifuged for 45 min at 14 000g, and the supernatant was collected. Digestion was quenched
by the addition of 50 μL of 5% TFA, into the sample solution.
Peptides were desalted using Empore C18 solid phase extraction (SPE)
cartridges (4 mm/1 mL, Sigma-Aldrich), and the remaining liquid was
evaporated in a SpeedVac (miVac DNA concentrator GeneVac, SP Scientific).
Dried samples were stored at −20 °C until analysis. Prior
to LC-MS, samples were reconstituted in 3% ACN and 1% formic acid.

NanoLC-ESI-MS/MS
Samples were analyzed on an Eksigent
Ekspert nanoLC 425 system (Sciex) coupled to the nanoelectrospray
interface (nanoESI) of a TripleTOF 5600+. After injection, samples
were loaded onto an Eksigent trap column (nano-LC trap set, ChromXP
C18, 120 Å, 350 μm, 0.5 mm) and desalted with 3% ACN and
0.1% FA at 2 μL/min.

The resulting peptides were analyzed
using an in-house packed analytical column (Magic C18 resin, 100 Å
pore size, 5 μm particles, 75 μm i.d., 10 cm column length)
at 300 nL/min. The elution gradient was composed of 5–40% B
(0.1% FA in ACN) for 45 min, 40–100% B for 5 min, 100% B for
9 min, and then the gradient was changed from 100 to 5% B in 1 min.
Mobile phase A was composed of 0.1% FA in H2O.

Samples
were analyzed in intensity dependent acquisition (IDA)
mode, and survey scans were acquired in 500 ms, with m/z from 400 to 1250 Da. In each duty cycle, 30 product
ion scans were collected for 100 ms in the m/z range from 100 to 1800 Da, if exceeding 100 counts per
seconds and if charge state was 2+ to 4+. Dynamic exclusion was used
for half of the peak width, and rolling collision energy was used.

Data Processing Parameters
Peak lists from raw data
files (.wiff) were created and converted into .mgf format using Protein
Pilot Software 5.0 (Sciex, Singapore). Files were imported into SearchGui
software47 and searched with X!Tandem against
the Uniprot human database (downloaded November 22, 2016) with the
search parameters as follows: enzyme trypsin, fixed modification carbamidomethylation
of C; variable modification oxidation of methionin; maximum number
of missed cleavages 2. Results were analyzed using Peptideshaker,48 and proteins at 1% FDR were filtered. Quantitative
evaluation of relative protein abundances and their comparison for
different extraction buffers and tissue thickness was performed using
normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) reported by Peptideshaker.
Protein sequences were obtained from the UniprotKB Web site (www.uniprot.org), and GRAVY indexes
were obtained using the GRAVY calculator (http://www.gravy-calculator.de).

Results and Discussion
Influence of the MS-Related Instrumental
Parameters
The peptide mixtures obtained from proteolysis
of protein extracts
of tissues are complex samples, and interaction between different
compounds in complex mixtures can influence their detection. Therefore,
sample-specific optimization of MS acquisition related parameters
can lead to more effective detection and fragmentation of the peptides.
In our study, variations in the TOF-MS and TOF-MS/MS accumulation
time showed most distinct influence on the number of identified proteins
and peptides (Figure S-1, Supporting Information). The optimal TOF-MS and TOF-MS/MS accumulation times were found
to be 500 and 100 ms respectively, and these parameters were used
for the rest of the study, as described in the Materials
and Methods.

Protein Extraction Buffers: Evaluation of
Efficiency and Reproducibility
Different methods for sample
preparation were evaluated for 10,
16, and 20 μm thick FF human uterus tissues. The protocols used
3 extraction buffers (SDS/30% ACN/urea, 30% ACN/urea and 60% ACN/urea)
and were also investigated for different digestion procedures (Protocols
1 to 5). The overview of the study workflow is schematically presented
in the Figure 1.

Qualitative variability was established by determining the overlap
between the 3 biological replicates of the 10 μm thick tissues,
and results are shown in Figure 2. A comparison of the results from Protocol 1 and Protocol
2 for 10 μm tissue showed (Figure S-2, Supporting Information) an overlap of 30.7% of proteins between the protocols,
while more unique proteins were identified using Protocol 2 (60.3%).
Results were also evaluated at the quantitative level, and reproducibility
of the protocols was assessed with their normalized spectral abundance
factor (NSAF) values, as reported by the Peptideshaker software.48 Pearson correlation coefficients demonstrated
for 10 μm thick tissue (Figure 2) that the protocols showed good reproducibility of
the NSAF values among the replicates (Pearson r ≥
0.78). Reproducibility was also evaluated for 16 and 20 μm thick
tissue samples, and the results are shown in Figure S-3, Supporting Information.

Figure 2 Summary of the results
showing qualitative and quantitative comparison
of five protocols for protein retrieval from 10 μm thick FF
human uterus tissue. Venn diagrams show the distribution of identified
proteins in biological replicates using Protocols 1 to 5, and correlation
of the NSAF values between replicates is shown using Pearson r coefficient.

Protein extraction using 30% ACN/urea (Protocol 2) were found
to
lead to 55% (10 μm tissue) and 20% (16 μm tissue) increase
in the number of identified proteins compared to extraction with SDS/30%
ACN/urea (Protocol 1) (Figure 3a, Figure S-4, Supporting Information). The lower number of proteins identified using Protocol 1 may be
related to sample loss during the precipitation procedure or incomplete
SDS removal. While both ACN and methanol are commonly used at a range
of concentrations,27−29 preliminary results in this study (data not shown)
revealed that methanol did not contribute to protein or peptide identifications;
therefore, ACN in the range 30–60% was used for optimization
of the extraction buffer. Variations in the concentration of ACN showed
comparable numbers of identified proteins in Protocols 2, 3, 4, and
5 (Figure S-4, Supporting Information).

Figure 3 Overview
of protein identifications and their quantitative values
using various protocols and tissue amounts. (a) Relative comparison
of identified proteins from 10 μm thick tissue after extraction
and digestion using Protocols 1 to 5. Addition of SDS into the protein
extraction buffer revealed a decrease in the number of identified
proteins (Protocol 1 as compared to Protocols 2–5). Similar
results were obtained for 16 μm thick tissue (Figure S-4, Supporting Information). (b) Quantitative comparison
of shared-protein abundance by NSAF values after extraction and digestion
using Protocol 2 for quantitation in the 10, 16, and 20 μm thick
tissue. Abundance of the proteins after tissue processing using Protocol
1 and Protocol 2 are shown for: (c) 10 μm and (d) 16 μm
thick FF human uterus tissue. Results are shown as mean ± SD.

The additional digestion (an extra
addition of trypsin) performed
in Protocols 3 and 5 did not increase the number of identified proteins;
however, more shared proteins between 3 biological replicates for
16 and 20 μm thick tissue were found (Figure S-2 (a–c), Supporting Information).

Quantitative Evaluation
of Proteins for Different FF Uterus
Tissue Thicknesses
The thickness of a tissue section is an
important factor as it relates to the amount of analyzed material.
To examine the effect of the tissue thickness on protein recovery,
we quantified proteins from 10, 16, and 20 μm microdissected
tissues. The protocols were evaluated on 3 replicates, and our results
demonstrated that an increase in tissue thickness led to an increased
number of identified proteins. After protein extraction and digestion
using Protocol 2 the number of identified proteins for 10, 16, and
20 μm thick tissue was 444 ± 31, 465 ± 11, and 535
± 74 (mean ± SD), respectively (Figure S-4, Supporting Information). To examine protein abundance
in relation to tissue thickness, proteins were assigned NSAF values.
Our results also showed (Figure 3b) that increasing tissue thickness also led to an
increased NSAF values, for matched areas of analyzed tissue in the
samples.

To further investigate possible differences in protein
extraction from Protocols 1 and 2, intensities of proteins detected
by both protocols (i.e., the overlap) were compared. Evaluation of
the tissue showed that there are 2400 cells/mm2 present
in smooth muscle of uterus. Although Protocol 1 led to fewer identified
proteins, it was demonstrated for both 10 and 16 μm thick tissue
that overlap proteins exhibited higher NSAF values for Protocol 1
than Protocol 2 (Figure 3c,d).

Further, we then evaluated the minimum amount of tissue
required
for quantitative analysis. For this purpose, 0.2, 0.6, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6,
and 2 mm2 of 10, 16, and 20 μm FF uterus tissue were
analyzed. The results showed (Figure 4a) that increasing the amount of injected tissue led
to an increase of number of identified proteins, following the same
trend for all examined tissue thicknesses. Also, an increase in tissue
thickness correlated with an increase in the measured abundance of
identified proteins, reported as NSAF values. Comparison of results
for different tissue thicknesses (Figure 4b) showed that 10 μm thick tissues
had the lowest NSAF values compared to corresponding samples between
16 and 20 μm thick tissues. Overall, our results showed sufficient
sensitivity of these method in that they could measure proteins from
extremely small amounts of tissue, such as 0.2 mm2, while
we observed a plateau in the number of identified proteins between
1 and 2 mm2.

Figure 4 Quantitative comparison of protein abundance
by NSAF values for
0.2, 0.6, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, and 2.0 mm2 of 10, 16, and 20
μm thick FF uterus tissue. Results are obtained after extraction
and digestion of the proteins using Protocol 2. (a) Number of identified
proteins; (b) NSAF values compared across different samples.

Comparison of Physicochemical
Properties of Identified Proteins
Qualitative evaluation
of the identified proteins was performed
in terms of sequence coverage, molecular weight, and GRAVY score,
which is a simple method for calculating the hydropathic character
of a protein.49 The interest in hydrophobic
proteins is that these proteins may be membrane-associated and therefore
difficult to solubilize. Proteins extracted and digested using Protocols
1 and 2 showed similar values of sequence coverage and NSAF values
after their categorization into several bins, as a function of their
molecular weight (Mw). The highest sequence
coverage was found for proteins with Mw from 10 to 20 kDa (approximately 35%), followed by the proteins
of 20–30 kDa (Figure 5a). Sequence coverage (Figure S-5, Supporting Information) and abundance of the proteins (Figure S-6, Supporting Information) as a function of their Mw were also evaluated for 16 and 20 μm
thick FF uterus tissue.

Figure 5 Distribution of the proteins identified from
3 biological replicates
in 10 μm thick FF human uterus tissue after extraction and digestion
using Protocols 1 and 2. (a) Sequence coverage; (b) NSAF values; and
(c) GRAVY index. Results are shown as mean ± SD.

Figure 5c shows
an analysis of the identified proteins in terms of their GRAVY. The
results show that protein distribution is biased to a negative GRAVY
value (in the region from −1.2 to 0), indicating that fewer
proteins with hydrophobic character were detected. In both methods,
the most abundant proteins were detected in the GRAVY index region
from −0.4 to −0.2 (32% and 25% for Protocol 1 and 2,
respectively) (Figure 5c). Comparison of the both methods shows that somewhat more proteins
were detected in the region from −1 to −0.4 when Protocol
2 was used, while moving toward more positive values (regions −0.4
to −0.2 and 0 to 0.2) showed an increase in the abundance of
the proteins extracted and digested using Protocol 1.

Conclusions
Retrieving protein information from small tissue amounts is important
as patient samples are mostly limited in their number and sample size
for each time point. The methods should be reproducible and effectively
provide a synoptic overview of the aberrant protein expression, sequences
and/or PTMs. Moreover, the development of analytical procedures that
can effectively and reproducibly enable analysis of minute samples
would spur on the development of less-invasive procedures for sampling
of patient tissues. In this study, we evaluated several procedures
in order to establish a simple yet fitting protocol for efficient
and reproducible protein extraction and digestion. Our results show
that using SDS, in combination with 30% ACN/urea results in 20% and
55% less identified proteins, when compared to a 30% ACN/urea extraction
only. However, the protein abundance scores, expressed as NSAF values,
from the SDS/30% ACN/urea mixture were higher when compared to 30%
ACN/urea alone. Thus, SDS effectively solubilizes a subset of the
proteome, but appears not to perform equally well on solubilizing
all proteins, with the methods we tested.

Furthermore, we report
that changes in the composition of the organic
solvent did not contribute significantly to the number of identified
proteins. However, an additional digestion with trypsin led to greater
overlap between replicates. A method using 30% ACN/urea buffer was
tested on very small amounts of the tissue, and these results show
that a small increment in the amount of tissue leads to an asymptotic
increase in the number of identified proteins and their abundances,
which plateaus in the range of 1–2 mm2.
