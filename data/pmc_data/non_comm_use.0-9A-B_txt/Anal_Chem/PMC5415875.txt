The determination
of molecular weights (MWs) of heavily glycosylated
proteins is seriously hampered by the physicochemical characteristics
and heterogeneity of the attached carbohydrates. Glycosylation impacts
protein migration during sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis. Standard electrospray
ionization (ESI)-mass spectrometry does not provide a direct solution
as this approach is hindered by extensive interference of ion signals
caused by closely spaced charge states of broadly distributed glycoforms.
Here, we introduce a native tandem MS-based approach, enabling charge-state
resolution and charge assignment of protein ions including those that
escape mass analysis under standard MS conditions. Using this method,
we determined the MW of two model glycoproteins, the extra-cellular
domains of the highly and heterogeneously glycosylated proteins CD38
and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), as well as the overall
MW and binding stoichiometries of these proteins in complex with a
specific antibody.

==== Body
Extensively
glycosylated proteins
occur in almost all living organisms.1,2 The glycan
chains attached to the protein backbone affect protein stability,
solubility, and conformation and also modulate functional activity
and biological processes including molecular recognition, signaling,
immune defense, inflammation, viral invasion, parasitic infections,
etc.3,4 Owing to the often high number of glycosylation
sites and the various co-occurring oligosaccharide patterns at each
site (e.g., composition, sequence, and linkage of monosaccharide residues),
glycoproteins exist naturally in a microheterogeneous mixture of a
number of glycoforms/proteoforms,5,6 exhibiting
a spectrum of biological activities and therapeutic efficacies7 and a wide distribution of the overall molecular
weight (MW) of glycoproteins. The average MW of the ensemble of glycoforms
is an indispensable parameter for determination of oligomeric states,
binding stoichiometries, and actual mass concentration (based on,
e.g., UV absorbance) and for derivation or estimation of various physical
properties (e.g., density, viscosity, diffusion, sedimentation, electrophoretic
mobility, specific heat capacity, etc.). Moreover, MW is helpful for
comparison of different batches of glycoproteins and assessment of
the efficiency of glycan trimming or removal. Unfortunately, conventional
biophysical approaches (see below) to measure MW dependent on biochemical
properties of these glycoproteins largely suffer from insufficient
accuracy.

We seek to enhance the accuracy in the assessment
of the average
MW by direct mass measurement using mass spectrometry (MS), which
has already been used as a powerful tool to localize the glycosylation
sites and profile site-specific glycosylation of glycoproteins.6,8−11 To avoid disrupting the integrity of proteins and provide the mass
information with higher precision under near-physiological conditions,
we performed measurements at the intact protein level using native
tandem MS. The model systems we focus on are the soluble extra-cellular
domains of the CD38 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), two
highly heterogeneously glycosylated proteins.12,13 For method validation, we estimate the carbohydrate contents of
both proteins based on the number of glycosylation sites present (4
and 9)14,15 and the MW range of the individual N-glycan
chains (1.4–2.7 kDa)15,16 determined by analysis
at the glycopeptide level (Table S1).

Experimental
Section
Materials
Soluble His-tagged extracellular domains
of EGFR (sEGFR) and CD38 (sCD38) and anti-CD38-IgG1 and anti-EGFR-IgG1
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were expressed and purified as previously
described.17 sCD38 was also produced in
a nonglycosylated format where the four residues N100, N164, N209,
and N219 that are glycosylated in the natural form were replaced with
aspartic acid. All other chemicals were of analytical grade or higher.
The deglycosylated formats of sCD38, sEGFR, and mAbs were produced
through PNGase F (Roche, Germany) treatment following the standard
procedures under denaturing or native (for mAb only) conditions.

Native Mass Spectrometry
Native MS experiments were
carried out with a Q-TOF-2 (Waters) mass spectrometer modified for
enhanced CID and equipped with a standard static nano-electrospray
ionization (ESI) source.18,19 Samples were electrosprayed
from an aqueous 150 mM ammonium acetate solution (pH adjusted to 7.5
with ammonium hydroxide). 20% (mol/mol) triethylammonium acetate (TEAA)
was added to the sample buffers for charge reduction.20,21 sCD38, sEGFR, and their antibody-bound complexes were assembled
through incubation at 21 °C for at least 10 min. Tandem MS was
performed by mass selection of precursor ions using a quadrupole mass
analyzer with an effective width of 140 Th at half-maximum of precursor
peak, followed by their collision with xenon molecules. The details
of other measurements are presented in the Supporting Information.

Results and Discussion
Using standard
proteins as MW markers, our sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) measurements of sCD38
and sEGFR resulted in deviated MW values which hinted at a carbohydrate
content of about 14 and 40 kDa, respectively (Figure 1A, Tables 1 and S1), close to the carbohydrate
content of the full-length proteins previously determined by SDS-PAGE.22,23 If these numbers are correct, the MW of each glycan chain would
be 3.6 and 4.5 kDa on average, far exceeding the upper MW limit of
the identified glycans. Such deviations, which are largely due to
the decrease in migration of glycoproteins resulting from poor glycan–SDS
interactions, are frequently encountered in MW determination of glycoproteins
using SDS-PAGE.24 Notably, MW determined
by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) deviated even further from
the estimated values (Figure 1B, Table 1).
Since the SEC elution of a protein is directly determined by the hydrodynamic
radius rather than the mass, the MW determination is influenced by
factors such as geometric shape,25 which
cannot be corrected for by calibrating with protein standards. Furthermore,
compared to the contribution of the protein content of the glycoprotein
to the hydrodynamic radius, the contribution of the attached glycan
may be disproportionate, leading to an exaggeration of the glycoprotein
MW.26 Coupling multiangle light-scattering
(MALS) with SEC enables one to determine to some extent the MW of
separated species based on their light-scattering properties.26,27 However, the accuracy in MW determination of glycoproteins by MALS
is hampered by multiple assumptions and approximations.27,28

sCD38 reference is displayed in gray, with the well-resolved charge
states labeled. From these analyses, the overall MW and the carbohydrate

d Single measurement.

As an approach that directly determines
MW, mass spectrometry (MS)
is generally capable of measurement of the mass of nonglycosylated
and slightly glycosylated proteins. Since proteins become multiply
charged in ESI and m/z (mass-to-charge
ratio) values are measured, the MW calculation requires the correct
assignment of charge states (z). As illustrated in Figure 1C, while nonglycosylated
proteins as exemplified by the nonglycosylated sCD38 give rise to
baseline-resolved signals whose m/z and charge-state determinations are straightforward, ESI signals
of proteins heterogeneously glycosylated such as sCD38 or sEGFR could
not be resolved due to overlapping ion signals from all diverse glycoforms/proteoforms
carrying different charges. Utilizing charge reduction in the native
ESI process with triethylammonium acetate (TEAA)20,29 did not improve the spectral resolution substantially (Figure 1C). Although a rough
estimation of the MW can be made using the centroid m/z of the unresolved signal envelope and the average
charge state (zavg) estimated on the basis
of an empirical correlation between MW and zavg detected in native MS30,31 (Table 1; see the Supporting Information for details), the precision
of such estimations are influenced by the physical properties (e.g.,
density) of the analytes and the experimental parameters adopted for
data acquisition which affect zavg.32 In fact, it has been argued that the average
charge state is correlated more precisely to the solvent exposed surface
area rather than the MW of the proteins.33 Moreover, it is likely not appropriate to use such an empirical
correlation derived from a panel of nonmodified proteins to heterogeneously
glycosylated proteins, as evidenced by the large deviations from the
estimated MWs (Table 1).

To improve the accuracy in MW determination using native
ESI-MS,
we introduce here a 3-step “dilution-tandem MS” strategy
(Figure 2A), aiming
to resolve and assign the charge states of the glycoprotein ions.
Step 1 “dilutes” the contribution of the heterogeneous
carbohydrate chains to the overall mass dispersion by attaching the
glycoprotein to a high MW protein. Therefore, sCD38 was incubated
with a specific and high-affinity human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb)
against CD38. With excess sCD38, mAb/sCD38 complexes were assembled
at a predominant stoichiometry of 1:2 as assessed by native MS,34 showing visibly better resolved charge states
than for the uncomplexed sCD38 (Figure 2B). In Step 2, we used TEAA as an additive in the spray
solution to reduce charging of the ion, further increasing the spectral
spacing between adjacent charge states (Figure 2B). Although the resulting charge-state resolution
appears to allow direct spectrum deconvolution, determination of charge
states of these ions is not straightforward since conventional algorithms35,36 frequently results in incorrect charge assignments for such high
MW glycoproteins37,38 (see ref (37) for a detailed explanation
on the origin of deviation). To solve this problem, in Step 3, we
applied mass selection of a subpopulation of ions with limited mass
dispersion.37,38 When subjecting these ions to
tandem MS, we used collision-induced dissociation (CID), which yielded
not only charge reduced species39 useful
for the MW calculation but also additional constraints enabling more
accurate charge calculations. As illustrated in Figure 2B, CID of the mass-selected (mAb)1/(sCD38)2i+ ions (where “i” stands for the unknown charge state) results in
(i – 1)+ and (i –
2)+ charged species (see Figure S1 for
detailed analysis) and release of N-terminal segments of the mAb heavy
chain, with MW ranging from 11 to 13 kDa (Figure S2A). The charge states of the complementary residual ions
are labeled as j+, (j – 1)+,
(j – 2)+, etc. Following the conventional
approach,36 we first determined i0 and j0, i.e.,
values of i and j that lead to the
least standard deviations of the corresponding MW (σM) (Figure 2C). Because
the mass profiles of the isolated ions and the charge-reduced ions
may be inconsistent, the proper assignments of i and j (ie and je) may not be i0 and j0 per se but rather their neighboring integer
values, despite the adequate resolution of the corresponding signal
peaks. Accordingly, we determined ie and je using an additional constraint defined by
the mass balance rule for the CID reaction, i.e., 1  where Mp is the
MW of precursor ions calculated using i, Mf is the average MW of the fragment ions, and Mr is the MW of the residual ions calculated
using j (see the Supporting Information). Then ie and je should give the least absolute value of ΔM, which is expressed as 2  

Figure 2 3-step approach enhancing
the accuracy in MW determination of highly
glycosylated proteins using native tandem ESI-MS. (A) Conceptual illustration
with essential steps indicated by the color-coded arrows. 1: Attaching
the glycoprotein (green) of interest to a high-MW-homogeneous protein
(e.g., mAb; gray) reduces the relative heterogeneity of the resulting
high MW complex (Mp). 2: Addition of TEAA
reduces the charge state of Mp to i+. 3: In tandem MS of Mp, the
release of fragments (Mf) removes additional
charges from the residual (Mr) and provides
constraints useful for charge and MW determination. (B) Native mass
spectra of sCD38 showing the effects of Steps 1–3. In gray,
the initial native MS spectrum of both the sCD38 and mAb/sCD38 complex
is shown in the upper panel and in blue its charge-reduced mass spectrum
is displayed; in the bottom panel, the tandem MS spectrum of mass-selected
sCD38 ions is shown. (C) Heat maps presenting σM (green
scale) and ΔM (blue–red scale). The
underlined numbers represent i0 and j0, and the bold, italic numbers represent ie and je. σM and ΔM values calculated using i0 and j0 are boxed
with thin lines, and those calculated using ie and je are boxed with thick lines.

As illustrated by the heat maps
presenting σM and
ΔM derived from a range of i–j combinations (Figure 2C), i0 and j0 (25 and 18) resulted in a ΔM of 7.8 kDa which is significantly larger than the experimental error
defined by σM (i0) and
σM (j0), satisfying the
mass profile constraint but violating the mass balance constraint.
23 and 17 that satisfy both constraints are determined as ie and je. Thus,
the MW of sCD38 can be calculated as 3  where MmAb is
known, and Mcomplex can be calculated
using ie and the corresponding centroid m/z values exhibited by the spectra of
ion ensembles (Figure 2B). With the MW of the polypeptide backbone (calculated on the basis
of the amino acid sequence) subtracted from MsCD38, the carbohydrate content was determined as 7.5 kDa,
within the coarse range estimated on the basis of the data obtained
at the glycopeptide level (Table 1, Table S1). In addition
to the accuracy evidenced by such agreement, this approach was also
validated in terms of self-consistency (see Figure S2B for detailed analysis).

Following the aforementioned
procedure, we next focused on the
even more extensively glycosylated sEGFR protein. After incubating
sEGFR with a specific high affinity human IgG1 mAb at a molar ratio
of 2:1, we detected two different mAb/sEGFR complexes in native MS
(denoted as “I” and “II” in Figure 3). Although the suboptimal
resolution of the signals hindered the direct mapping of the charge
states of isolated proteoforms to those of the ensemble, we nevertheless
determined MsEGFR by averaging the MsEGFR′ derived from multiple isolation windows spanning multiple charge
states (see Figure S3). The content of
sEGFR in Complex II was determined to be twice that in Complex I (Figure S3B,C), indicating incorporation of 1
and 2 copies of sEGFR in Complexes I and II, respectively. Such stoichiometries
agree with the previous observation that this mAb binds to EGFR expressing
cells at least partly in a bivalent manner.40MsEGFR derived from the two complex
species were consistent (Figure S3), and
the accordingly calculated carbohydrate content lies within the range
of expected values (Table S1).

Figure 3 Determination
of MW of sEGFR. (A) Native mass spectra of mAb/sEGFR
show the formation of two complexes of different stoichiometries (I
and II), whose signals are magnified 20-fold for visualization. (B)
Tandem MS of the mass-selected subpopulation of Complex I (Mp) results in the release of light chains (L) and fragments from the light chain (Mf), leaving the corresponding residual species Mp–L and Mr. The masses and charge constraints derived from these
are used for the calculation of the MW. Similar experiments on complex
II provided the MW and carbohydrate content of complex II (Figure S3).

Conclusions
In summary, we developed an MS-based approach
to measure heterogeneously
glycosylated proteins. With this calibrant-free approach, we determined
the average MW of two glycoproteins whose carbohydrate content can
contribute more than 20% to the total MW. The MW determination is
based on the mass of the analytes per se and is thus independent of
the factors (e.g., shape, radius, electrophoretic behavior) that typically
lead to significant systematic errors. In comparison to the MS analysis
at the glycopeptide level, which provides a rough estimate of the
mass, our approach directly measures the mass distribution of intact
glycoproteins. Since the “dilution” of heterogeneity
is performed regardless of the nature of the intermolecular interactions,
this approach can be applied to various noncovalently binding and
covalent conjugation systems, allowing a broad range of glycoproteins
to be analyzed. In addition, the compatibility of this approach with
native conditions enabled MW determination of intact glycoproteins
simultaneously with determination of binding stoichiometry.
