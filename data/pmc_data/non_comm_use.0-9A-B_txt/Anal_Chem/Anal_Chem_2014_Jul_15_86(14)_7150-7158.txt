Multiplexed quantitation via isobaric
chemical tags (e.g., tandem
mass tags (TMT) and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation
(iTRAQ)) has the potential to revolutionize quantitative proteomics.
However, until recently the utility of these tags was questionable
due to reporter ion ratio distortion resulting from fragmentation
of coisolated interfering species. These interfering signals can be
negated through additional gas-phase manipulations (e.g., MS/MS/MS
(MS3) and proton-transfer reactions (PTR)). These methods, however,
have a significant sensitivity penalty. Using isolation waveforms
with multiple frequency notches (i.e., synchronous precursor selection,
SPS), we coisolated and cofragmented multiple MS2 fragment ions, thereby
increasing the number of reporter ions in the MS3 spectrum 10-fold
over the standard MS3 method (i.e., MultiNotch MS3). By increasing
the reporter ion signals, this method improves the dynamic range of
reporter ion quantitation, reduces reporter ion signal variance, and
ultimately produces more high-quality quantitative measurements. To
demonstrate utility, we analyzed biological triplicates of eight colon
cancer cell lines using the MultiNotch MS3 method. Across all the
replicates we quantified 8 378 proteins in union and 6 168
proteins in common. Taking into account that each of these quantified
proteins contains eight distinct cell-line measurements, this data
set encompasses 174 704 quantitative ratios each measured in
triplicate across the biological replicates. Herein, we demonstrate
that the MultiNotch MS3 method uniquely combines multiplexing capacity
with quantitative sensitivity and accuracy, drastically increasing
the informational value obtainable from proteomic experiments.

==== Body
Mass spectrometry
(MS) based
quantitative proteomics has traditionally been limited to binary and
ternary comparisons (e.g., SILAC based quantitation).1−4 As such, proteomics has trailed behind the technologies employed
in transcriptome analysis. Multiplexed quantitation via isobaric chemical
tags (e.g., tandem mass tags (TMT) and isobaric tags for relative
and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)) provide an avenue for greater parallelization
of quantitative mass spectrometry.5−7

Identical peptides,
derived from different samples, and labeled
with different versions of the isobaric tags, are indistinguishable
in their intact form. However, upon isolation and fragmentation in
the mass spectrometer, each peptide variant produces a unique reporter
ion. Multiplexing quantitative analyses through multichannel isobaric
tagging shows great promise for its ability to (1) improve throughput,
(2) increase the breadth of coverage by avoiding missing values, and
(3) deepen analysis by simplifying complex chromatograms that are
typically populated by multiple forms of the same peptide.8

In theory, the abundance of the isobaric
tag reporter ions should
be directly proportional to the relative amount of each precursor
in each sample. In practice, however, coisolation and cofragmentation
of interfering ions results in distorted TMT ratios. Reporter ions
originating from the isobaric tags of the target population are indistinguishable
from reporter ions originating from any interfering ions. Therefore,
any coisolated interfering precursor ions will contribute to the final
reporter ion population in an unpredictable manner that obfuscates
the true reporter ion intensities.

This interference phenomenon
was detailed recently in a series
of publications.9−15 Using a two-proteome model, we showed that nearly all the measurements
obtained with standard tandem MS (i.e., MS2) were distorted by interfering
ions. We also demonstrated that an MS3 spectrum based on one of the
TMT labeled MS2 fragment ions can mitigate the negative impact of
these interfering signals.14 Alternative
methods that utilize ion–ion chemistry in place of energetic
fragmentation have been demonstrated.15 While the additional round of gas-phase selectivity provided by
these MS3 methods dramatically reduces the contribution of any interfering
signals, it also reduces overall sensitivity. By dividing the initial
precursor signal among all the possible product ions and selecting
only a single product ion for subsequent interrogation, only a small
percentage of MS1 precursor ions are converted into the MS3 reporter
ions.

Herein, we describe a solution to the sensitivity limitations
of
the MS3 method, in which we use isolation waveforms with multiple
frequency notches for synchronous precursor selection (SPS) of multiple
MS2 fragment ions. We fragment the aggregate MS3 precursor population
(i.e., MultiNotch MS3) to produce a reporter ion population that is
far more intense than the population we would have produced had we
only fragmented a single MS2 ion. At the same time, we maintain the
selectivity of the standard MS3 method by carefully defining the isolation
notches of the SPS isolation waveform to ensure high isolation specificity
of the target MS2 fragment ions. In summary, we introduce a new quantitative
proteomic method, which provides a unique combination of multiplexing
capacity, high sensitivity, and quantitative accuracy.

Methods
Two-Proteome
Interference Model
The two-proteome interference
model was prepared as previously.14,16 HeLa S3 cells
were grown in suspension to 1 × 106 cells/mL. Yeast
cells were grown to an OD of 1.0. Cells were lysed in 6 M guanidiumthiocyanate,
50 mM Hepes (pH 8.5, HCl). Protein content was measured using a BCA
assay (Thermo Scientific), disulfide bonds were reduced with dithiothreitol
(DTT), and cysteine residues were alkylated with iodoacetamide as
previously described.17 Protein lysates
were cleaned with methanol–chloroform precipitation.18 The samples were redissolved in 6 M guanidiumthiocyanate,
50 mM Hepes pH 8.5, and diluted to 1.5 M guanidium thiocyanate, 50
mM Hepes (pH 8.5). Both lysates were digested overnight with Lys-C
(Wako) in a 1/50 enzyme/protein w/w ratio. Following digestion, the
sample was acidified with TFA to a pH < 2 and subjected to C18 solid-phase extraction (SPE, Sep-Pak, Waters).

The
TMT reagents were dissolved in 40 μL of acetonitrile, and 10
μL of the solution was added to 100 μg of peptides dissolved
in 100 μL of 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.5). After incubating for 1 h
at room temperature (22 °C), the reaction was quenched by adding
8 μL of 5% w/v hydroxylamine. Following labeling, the sample
was combined in desired ratios. Yeast aliquots were mixed at 10:4:1:1:4:10,
and HeLa was mixed at 1:1:1:0:0:0 (Figure 1A). Those two samples were then mixed at a 1/1 w/w ratio and subjected
to C18 solid-phase extraction.

Figure 1 (A) Yeast was digested
with LysC and labeled with TMT (10:4:1:1:4:10).
That sample was combined with a TMT labeled HeLa sample (1:1:1:0:0:0).
(B) A TMT-labeled, yeast peptide (NAAWLVFANK) was interrogated in
back-to-back scans using (left spectrum) MS2, where the MS1 precursor
was fragmented using HCD. (Middle) MS3, where the MS1 precursor was
fragmented with CID, and a single MS2 product ion was isolated and
fragmented using HCD. And, (right) MultiNotch MS3, where multiple
MS2 product ions were simultaneously isolated and fragmented. (C)
The precursor populations of the standard and MultiNotch MS3 scans
used to generate the reporters above (middle and bottom spectra, respectively).
For reference, we also include the ITMS2 spectrum prior to MS3 precursor
isolation (top).

Colorectal Cancer Cell
Culture, Sample Preparation, and TMT
Labeling
Colo205, LoVo, DLD-1, SW48, HT-29, HCT-15, HT55,
and HCT-116 cells were cultured in 15 cm plates containing RPMI, 10%
FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin. Each cell line was grown in 10%
CO2 to ∼90% confluence. Cells were starved for 4
h in RPMI, washed 3 times with 15 mL of cold PBS, harvested into an
Eppendorf tube, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Following harvesting,
the remaining sample steps in the sample preparation process closely
matched the steps of the two-proteome sample (Supporting Information).

Basic-pH Fractionation
and Low-pH Reverse Phase LC Analysis
Human colorectal peptides
were subjected to basic-pH reverse-phase
HPLC fractionation. Mixed and labeled peptides were solubilized in
buffer A (5% ACN, 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0) and separated
on an Agilent 300 Extend C18 column (5 μm particles, 4.6 mm
i.d., and 20 cm in length). Using an Agilent 1100 binary pump equipped
with a degasser and a photodiode array (PDA) detector, a 50 min linear
gradient from 18% to 45% acetonitrile in 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate
pH 8 (flow rate of 0.8 mL/min) separated the peptide mixture into
a total of 96 fractions. The 96 fractions were consolidated into 24
samples, acidified with 10% formic acid, and vacuum-dried. Each sample
was redissolved with 5% formic acid/5% ACN, desalted via StageTip,
dried via vacuum centrifugation, and reconstituted for LC–MS/MS
analysis.

All LC–MS experiments were performed on a Velos-Orbitrap
Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific) coupled to a Proxeon
nLC-1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) ultra high-pressure liquid chromatography
(UPLC) pump. Peptides were separated on a 75 μm inner diameter
microcapillary column. The tip for the column was pulled in-house
and the column was packed with approximately 0.5 cm of Magic C4 resin
(5 μm, 100 Å, Michrom Bioresources) followed by 25 cm of
Sepax Technologies GP-C18 resin (1.8 μm, 120 Å). Separation
was achieved by applying a 3–22% ACN gradient in 0.125% formic
acid over 165 min at ∼300 nL/min. Electrospray ionization was
enabled by applying a voltage of 2.0 kV through an IDEX high-pressure
fitting at the inlet of the microcapillary column. In the case of
the two-proteome mixture, the linear gradient was shortened to 70
min.

Implementation of the MultiNotch MS3 Method
The implementation
of the isolation waveforms for synchronous precursor selection was
the greatest hurdle toward implementing the MultiNotch MS3 method.
All instrument modifications needed to enable this method were performed
in-house and entailed changes to the instrument control code. The
fundamental technologies of this method are ion traps and notched
isolation waveforms. The idea of concurrently isolating multiple discrete
ion populations with isolation waveforms that have multiple frequency
notches was developed in the mid-1980s, when much of the original
work was done in the laboratories of Marshall19,20 and McLafferty.21 Since then Cooks, McLuckey,
and others have contributed to the field.22,23 Yet, this is the first time this technology has ever been used in
an online, large-scale proteomics experiment with multiplexed quantitation.
Briefly, these waveforms isolate the ions of interest by ejecting
unwanted ions through energetic excitation. The frequencies comprising
the isolation waveform excite the trapped ions through on-resonance
excitation. However, where a notch exists in the list of frequencies,
the ions remain stably trapped (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).

All of the initial development
work for this method was focused on defining equations that could
accurately describe the size and location for any possible notch in
the SPS waveform. To this end, we injected mixtures of ions with known m/z values into the instrument, and we
isolated those ions using a series of SPS isolation waveforms. During
these experiments, we varied the notch width and location, and the
isolation efficiency was recorded as a function of those parameters.
Figure 2A shows the data generated by performing
this analysis on an ion with 989 m/z. As the q-value of the ion varies, so does the
optimal position and width of the isolation notch. This type of analysis
was repeated for many ions, and the resulting aggregate data sets
were fitted using linear regression (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information).

Figure 2 (A) While infusing an
ion with an m/z ratio of 989, we
varied the isolation notch width and location.
We recorded the isolation efficiency as a function of those parameters.
This analysis was repeated for the series of ions, and the resulting
data set was fitted using linear regression. (B) During a 90 min MultiNotch
LC–MS2/MS3 analysis of the yeast/human two-proteome sample,
we isolated the MS3 precursor population without any subsequent fragmentation.
We then calculated the fraction of MS2 ions retained in the MS3 precursor
population.

With these equations
in hand, we could define isolation waveforms
for any ensemble of ions. Typically we captured 10 MS2 fragment ions
in our MS3 precursor population. Surprisingly, by simply isolating
10 MS2 fragment ions, we are able to retain ∼40% of the MS2
total ion current in the MS3 precursor population (Figure 2B). Coupling in the losses from CID, we typically
retained ∼25% of our initial MS1 population in the MS3 precursor
population. This was a vast improvement over the traditional MS3 approach,
where only ∼5% of the initial precursor population was retained.

In addition to the waveform declaration algorithms, we employed
functions that intelligently scaled the precursor injection time based
upon the expected TMT signal (Supporting Information). Coupled together, these features for selecting precursors, declaring
the MultiNotch MS3 isolation waveform, and intelligently scaling ion
injection times resulted in a 10-fold increase in TMT reporter ion
intensities with the MultiNotch MS3 approach, relative to the standard
MS3 scan type (Figure 3A).

Figure 3 TMT-labeled, two-proteome
mixture (yeast/human) was analyzed by
LC–MS2, standard MS3, and MultiNotch MS3. (A) We distributed
the quantitative spectra by the number of TMT reporter ions. (B) We
also distributed the quantitative spectra using three select TMT ratios
(channels 126:128, 127:128, and 128:129, i.e., 10:1, 4:1, and 1:1).
The expected ratios are denoted using the dashed lines.

Mass Spectrometry
The mass spectrometer
was operated
in data-dependent mode for both the MS2 and MS3 methods. For both
methods we collected a survey scan of 300–1 500 m/z in the Orbitrap
at a resolution of 60 000 (FTMS1) and an AGC target of 1 ×
106. We selected the 10 most intense ions for MS analysis.
Precursor ions were filtered according to charge state (required >1z), dynamic exclusion (40 s with a ±10 ppm window),
and monoisotopic precursor selection.

During the MS2 analyses,
precursors were fragmented by high-energy collision induced dissociation
(HCD) followed by Orbitrap analysis (FTMS2). FTMS2 precursors were
isolated using a width of 2.0 m/z and fragmented with a normalized collision energy of 40. Precursors
were accumulated to an AGC target of 5 × 104 or a
maximum injection time of 250 ms.

During the MS3 analyses, the
MS1 precursors were first interrogated
by ITMS2 using CID. Precursors were isolated using a 1.2 m/z isolation window. They were accumulated to an
AGC target of 5 000 or a maximum injection time of 125 ms.
This ITMS2 spectrum was used to determine the conditions of the MS3
analysis (e.g., which fragments to interrogate). For the MS3 scan,
the MS1 precursor was isolated using a 2.5 m/z wide window and fragmented with CID. Following fragmentation,
the MS3 precursor population was isolated using the SPS waveform and
then fragmented by HCD. The HCD normalized collision energy was set
to 50. The m/z value used in the
NCE calculation was the weighted average of all the MS3 precursor
ions. During the MS3 analysis we used an online isolation specificity
filter (Supporting Information).

MS2 Spectra
Assignment, Data Processing, and Protein Assignment
Following
data acquisition, Thermo RAW files were processed using
a series of software tools that were developed in-house. First the
RAW files were converted to mzXML using a custom version of ReAdW.exe
(http://sashimi.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/sashimi/) that
had been modified to export ion accumulation times and FT peak noise.
During this initial processing we also corrected any erroneous assignments
of monoisotopic m/z. Using Sequest,24 MS2 spectra were searched against the human
UniProt database (downloaded on 08/02/2011), supplemented with the
sequences of common contaminating proteins such as trypsin. This forward
database was followed by a decoy component, which included all target
protein sequences in reversed order.

Searches were performed
using a 50 ppm precursor ion tolerance.25 When searching Orbitrap MS2 data, we used 0.02 Th fragment ion tolerance.
The fragment ion tolerance was set to 1.0 Th when searching ITMS2
data. Only peptide sequences with both termini consistent with the
protease specificity of LysC were considered in the database search,
and up to two missed cleavages were accepted. TMT tags on lysine residues
and peptide N-termini (+ 229.162932 Da) and carbamidomethylation of
cysteine residues (+ 57.02146 Da) were set as static modifications,
while oxidation of methionine residues (+ 15.99492 Da) was treated
as a variable modification. An MS2 spectral assignment false discovery
rate of less than 1% was achieved by applying the target-decoy strategy.26 Filtering was performed using linear discriminant
analysis as described previously27 to create
one composite score from the following peptide ion and MS2 spectra
properties: Sequest parameters XCorr and unique ΔCn, peptide
length and charge state, and precursor ion mass accuracy. The resulting
discriminant scores were used to sort peptides prior to filtering
to a 1% FDR, and the probability that each peptide-spectral-match
was correct was calculated using the posterior error histogram.

Following spectral assignment, peptides were assembled into proteins
and proteins were further filtered based on the combined probabilities
of their constituent peptides to a final FDR of 1%. In cases of redundancy,
shared peptides were assigned to the protein sequence with the most
matching peptides, thus adhering to principles of parsimony.28

Quantitative Data Analysis and Data Presentation
When
analyzing TMT reporter ion signals, we used the ratio between the
reporter ion intensity and the peak noise. This ratio has been shown
to scale quite well with the number of ions in the Orbitrap peak,
i.e., ∼5 charges are equal to a S/N ratio of 1.29 Hence, this ratio is more meaningful when making
qualitative judgments about the ion statistics of a given reporter
signal than the injection time scaled intensity. The isotopic impurities
of the TMT reagent were corrected using the values specified by the
manufacturer.30

When processing the
colorectal cancer data, we filtered our data to only include quantitative
spectra that possessed a summed TMT reporter S/N of 100. On the basis
of previous work and simulation, this was determined to be the minimum
number of reporter ions necessary to ensure that ion statistics would
not be a source of significant reporter variance (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information).31

Using our protein-level peptide grouping as a guide, we summed
the TMT signals from the peptide level quantitative spectra to produce
our protein level quantitative data. These quantitative signals were
summed across all quantified proteins, and then these sums were normalized
across all TMT reporter channels, hence, correcting for minor mixing
errors and reflecting equal total protein content per cell line. These
normalized intensities were then scaled across each protein to a net
total of 100.

To look for proteins that were significantly altered
in at least
one colorectal cancer cell line, we used a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with Welch’s correction to control for unequal variances
between TMT channels.32 An false discovery
rate (FDR) of 1% was controlled using the Benjamini–Hochberg
method. The ReactomeFI analysis was performed using the Cytoscape
plug-in provided by the developers.33 Principal
components analysis was performed using R (R Core
Team, Vienna, Austria, http://www.R-project.org). PC1 loadings
were extracted and sorted by absolute value to choose the top contributors.
All proteins from the Vogelstein et al. gene set that were quantified
in the MultiNotch MS3 data set were extracted and mean expression
values across all replicates were used to calculate a Euclidean distance
to SMAD4 and IDH2. Proteins were then sorted by this distance to produce
the nearest expression profiles.

Results
Coisolating
and Cofragmenting Multiple MS2 Fragment Ions
Using isolation
waveforms with multiple frequency notches, we coisolated
and cofragmented multiple MS2 fragment ions during our MS3 analyses
(MultiNotch MS3). We implemented this method with the aim of increasing
the number of TMT reporter ions in the resulting quantitative MS3
spectrum. However, with the MultiNotch MS3 method we employ multiple
isolation notches, and some of those notches tend to be larger than
the isolation notches of the standard MS3 method (see Methods); hence, we lose some selectivity with the MultiNotch
method compared to the standard. With these concerns in mind, we benchmarked
the MultiNotch MS3 method using a two-proteome model to measure ratio
distortion and sensitivity.14

We
digested a yeast lysate with LysC, labeled separate aliquots using
TMT, and then mixed those aliquots at 10:4:1:1:4:10 (Figure 1A). We also digested a human lysate using LysC,
labeled three aliquots, and mixed those aliquots at ratios of 1:1:1.
Finally, the labeled human and yeast peptide mixtures were combined
at a 1:1 ratio.

For all subsequent analyses, we treated the
yeast peptides as the
target population, and the human peptides as the interfering ions.
In the absence of any interfering human signals, yeast peptides should
produce a reporter ion distribution that corresponds to the mixing
ratios (i.e., 10:4:1:1:4:10). However, with the MS2 method we generally
observed a distortion of these intensities. This is exemplified by
the left spectrum of Figure 1B, where a ratio
that should have been 10:1 has been distorted to 5:1 by the presence
of interfering reporter ions.

When the same yeast peptide precursor
ion was interrogated using
a standard MS3 scan (Figure 1B, middle spectrum),
due to poor sensitivity we were unable to detect the lowest abundance
channels. In comparison, when we used the MultiNotch MS3 method to
coisolate and cofragment multiple peaks from the MS2 spectrum, even
the lowest abundance channels were detected and the ratios remained
accurate (Figure 1B, right spectrum).

In Figure 1C, we provide spectra of the
MS3 precursor populations used to generate the reporter ion distributions
of Figure 1B. The middle spectrum presents
analysis of the standard MS3 precursor population, while the bottom
spectrum presents the MultiNotch MS3 precursor population. For reference
we also include the spectrum on top, in which we analyzed the MS2
fragment ion population prior to isolating the MS3 precursor populations.
By increasing the number of precursor from 1 to 6, we are able to
substantially increase the final reporter ion population. At the same
time the notched isolation waveforms preserve the specificity of the
MS3 scan by effectively removing unwanted ions.

Analyzing the
Entire Two-Proteome Data Set
In Figure 3, we provide a more complete picture of the difference
in performance between the three methods. In separate 90 min LC–MS
analyses, we interrogated the two-proteome sample using the MS2, standard
MS3, and MultiNotch MS3 methods. In Figure 3A, we show the distribution of TMT ions. As noted earlier, the sensitivity
of the standard MS3 method is quite poor, and on average we only detected
∼200 TMT reporter ions per MS3 spectrum. The MultiNotch MS3
scan typically produced ∼2 500 reporter ions per MS3
spectrum. This is over an order of magnitude more reporter ions per
quantitative spectrum, and it is also close to the number of reporter
ions we produced on average using the MS2 method (∼3 100).
Though, in the case of the MS3 measurements, we utilized higher AGC
targets and maximum injection times than for the MS2 measurements
(see Methods).

In Figure 3B we compare how accurately the three methods measured the
reporter ion ratios. We focused on the 10:1 and 4:1 ratios, where
all the channels have interfering signals (TMT-126/128 and TMT-127/128,
respectively). We also included a 1:1 ratio, which we derived from
the two channels with the lowest intensity (TMT-128/129). With this
ratio one of the channels is shared with an interfering human reporter
ion (TMT-128), while the other channel is pure (TMT-129). We included
this last ratio to highlight how interfering signals can distort measured
ratios upward as well and downward. In the standard MS2 data, the
10:1 and 4:1 ratios distorted downward such that the typical values
across the entire LC–MS analysis were 5:1 and 2:1, respectively.
Even more distressing, the 1:1 ratio distorted upward such that typical
values were 2:1. Because of the coisolation and cofragmentation of
interfering ions during an MS2 analysis, we could no longer confidently
measure the difference between ratios that should be 1:1 and 4:1.
In contrast, with the MS3 methods we typically recorded the expected
ratios (i.e., 10:1, 4:1, and 1:1). For this analysis, we required
that all six reporter channels were present before analyzing a given
spectrum, which resulted in a more than 4-fold increase of the number
of quantified yeast spectra from the MultiNotch MS3 method (1794),
compared to the standard MS3 method (438).

Analyzing an 8-Plex Sample
of Colon Cancer Cell Lines
Beyond demonstrating the technical
capabilities of the MultiNotch
MS3 method with the two-proteome model, we sought to demonstrate the
practicality of the method using a large-scale proteomics experiment.
To this end, we prepared a TMT 8-plex sample that consisted of eight
different colorectal cancer cell lines: Colo-205, LoVo, DLD-1, SW48,
HT-29, HCT-15, HT-55, and HCT-116 (Figure 4A). We grew all eight cell lines in biological triplicate, harvested
the proteins, and digested the resulting proteome samples with LysC.
Following digestion, we labeled the samples with the TMT reagents,
mixed the labeled peptides, and fractionated the mixtures using offline
basic-pH reverse phase HPLC. We collected 24 fractions, which we then
analyzed using a 3-h LC–MS3 method. To analyze each biological
replicate required 3 days of analysis time, and to collect the entire
data set required 9 days.

Figure 4 (A) Eight colorectal cancer cell lines were
grown in biological
triplicate. Each replicate was digested with LysC, labeled with TMT,
fractionated, and analyzed using MultiNotch MS3 (3-h LC gradients).
(B) All protein ratios from replicates 1 and 2 were plotted against
each other. In total this represents 172 704 quantitative ratios.
(C) Across the three replicate we performed a one way ANOVA with Welch’s
correction. (D) We highlighted the protein expression profile for
two commonly studied proteins, EGFR and MSH6, and (E) the WT and mutant
(G13D) forms of KRAS.

Across the three biological replicates, the MultiNotch MS3
method
quantified 8 378 proteins in at least one of the replicates
and 6 168 in all three. In the latter case, this represents
eight quantitative measurements per protein per biological replicate.
Considering that 8 TMT channels allow the determination of 28 binary
comparisons, the quantitative breadth of these analyses entails 172 704
quantitative protein abundance ratios measured in all three biological
replicates.

Next, we compared the quantitative reproducibility
between replicate
measurements. In Figure 4B, we show all the
quantitative ratios from the first biological replicate plotted against
the ratios from the second. We observed high correlation between the
replicate measurements (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.86),
which confirms the high reproducibility of the MultiNotch MS3 method,
as well as of the TMT-based workflow, and of quantitative proteomics
in general. After all, the variation in this plot is the summation
of all the variances across the entire experiment, from cell culture
to mass spectrometer analysis.

Using data from the biological
triplicate measurements, we also
performed a one way ANOVA with Welch’s correction for unequal
variance. We adjusted the resulting p-values using
the Benjamini–Hochberg multiple test correction (Figure 4C). Across the biological data set, we detected
4 107 proteins where the cell-line specific expression profile
varied in a statistically significant manner (adjusted p-value <0.01). These data demonstrate strikingly different expression
levels for thousands of proteins. Nearly 10% of the quantified proteins
showed a 10-fold difference somewhere in their expression profiles,
and ∼75% demonstrated at least one 2-fold difference.

As examples, we highlight two proteins known to often play central
roles in colorectal tumorigenesis: EGFR and MSH6 (Figure 4D). EGFR was quantified based on an average of 26
peptides per biological replicate. MSH6 was quantified based on an
average of 14 peptides/replicate. Indeed, the average number of peptides
used for quantitation in each replicate was ∼88 000.
This good protein coverage, and the high accuracy of the MultiNotch
MS3 method, translates into high reproducibility between replicates.

In Figure 4E, we highlight the expression
profile of KRAS, a protein tightly associated with many cancers. As
with EGFR and MSH6, we observed good protein coverage (>10 peptides
per replicate) and high reproducibility between the biological replicates.
In the bottom panel of Figure 4E, we highlight
the detection and quantitation of a peptide from a mutated form of
KRAS. Four of the cell lines examined are known to harbor this KRAS-activating
mutation (DLD-1, HCT-116, HCT-15, and Lovo). This mutation involves
a substitution of an aspartic acid (D) for the glycine (G) at the
13th position. Because this mutation entails a single amino acid substitution,
to unambiguously quantify the mutated form of the protein, the MS3
method must successfully interrogate a single peptide in the pool
of hundreds of thousands that comprise the sample. In spite of this
hurdle, the MultiNotch MS3 quantified the mutated form in all three
biological replicates.

Quantitative Proteomics Reveals Cellular
Pathways Deregulated
in the Cancer Cell Lines
A recent review by Vogelstein and
colleagues detailed a set of genes frequently mutated across many
cancers and are thus likely to be drivers of the disease.34,35 The MultiNotch MS3 method detected many differentially expressed
proteins in this gene set across several biological processes (Figure 5A). These included chromatin modification, PI3K
and RAS signaling, and the cell cycle. Mapping these proteins onto
the ReactomeFI network (Figure 5B)33 revealed four modules that correlate with known
colorectal cancer biology. Notably, DNA mismatch repair defects are
a primary driver of mutational burden in heritable colorectal cancers.36 Similarly, signaling downstream of EGFR and
WNT are often a critical drivers in many colorectal cancers.37

in the hypermutated and nonhypermutated lines, respectively. (E,F)
The Vogelstein gene set proteins with expression profiles most similar
to SMAD4 (E) and IDH2 (F).

Principal component analysis on all quantified proteins in
the
entire MultiNotch MS3 data set (Figure 5C)38 revealed that PC1 clearly separated hypermutated
from nonhypermutated cell lines. This division is prognostic for colorectal
cancers, as patients with hypermutated tumors fare better.36 Several of the primary contributors to PC1 are
also mutated at a high rate in colorectal cancers (e.g., MSH6 and
P53, Figure 5D).

The MultiNotch MS3 data
reproduced a recent report that SMAD4 is
highly expressed in hypermutated tumors (Figure 5D), correlating with a positive prognosis.39 That work did not quantify the difference between the two phenotypes,
and here we report an average 5.5-fold up-regulation of SMAD4 protein
in the hypermutated cell lines.

Using the SMAD4 expression profile
as a prototype, we looked for
other proteins encoded by the Vogelstein gene set that showed similar
expression patterns (Figure 5E). The top hits
for nearby profiles were not for the BMP/TGF-Beta signaling pathways
but rather for telomere maintenance (WRN), Notch (NOTCH2), and MAPK
signaling (RAF1). WRN and NOTCH2 have been previously linked to colorectal
cancer.40,41 In contrast to BRAF, RAF1 (CRAF) has not
been linked to colorectal cancer, but these results suggest that it
might play a role in hypermutated tumors.

Mutations in IDH1
and IDH2 are frequently found in a number of
cancer types.34,42 Surprisingly, higher IDH2 expression
was one of the best predictors of the nonhypermutated phenotype in
our cell lines (Figure 5D) despite not being
traditionally associated with colorectal cancer. As with SMAD4, we
used IDH2 as a prototype to look for similar expression profiles (Figure 5F). Other metabolic proteins, however, were not
the closest profiles to IDH2. Rather, excision repair (ERCC5), PPAR
gamma signaling (PPARG), and EGFR signaling (ERBB2) were closer matches.
Both PPARG and ERBB2 have been well tied to colorectal cancer.36,43 In contrast, ERCC5 has not been associated with colorectal cancer.
The up-regulation suggests a possible role for DNA excision repair
in nonhypermutated tumors

Discussion
The
combination of quantitative isobaric reagents and the MultiNotch
MS3 method facilitated the quantitation of 8 378 proteins across
biological triplicates. Taking into account that every quantified
protein contains expression information for eight different cells
lines, and limiting our scope to only measurements that were made
in all three biological replicates, we reproducibly quantified 172 704
protein abundance changes between individual cell lines. To achieve
similar breadth of quantitative analysis, including eight samples
and three biological replicates, would require 24 separate experiments
using a simple duplex quantitative method (e.g., SILAC). In contrast
we only need three separate experiments using the TMT 8-plex workflow.

Though isobaric reagents for relative quantitation (e.g., TMT and
iTRAQ) always had the potential to increase sample throughput, the
actual utility of the tags was questionable due to ratio distortion
caused by interfering ions. Though the standard MS3 method successfully
countered the detrimental effects of the interfering ions, this method
entailed a substantial sensitivity penalty. Herein, we overcome this
limitation by coisolating multiple MS2 fragment ions using isolation
waveforms with multiple notches (i.e., SPS), thereby converting far
more MS1 precursor ions into MS3 TMT reporter ions.

It is remarkable
how much of the MS2 signal can be captured in
the MS3 precursor population using a MultiNotch MS3 scan. Typically
10 MS2 fragment ions were targeted for synchronous precursor selection,
which translated into ∼40% of the MS2 total ion current (Figure 2). Taking into account the fragmentation efficiency
of CID, we retained ∼25% of our initial MS1 precursor population
in the MS3 precursor population. This is a vast improvement over the
traditional MS3 approach, where ∼5% of the initial precursor
population was retained in the MS3 precursor population. Coupled together
with some additional algorithms for selecting precursors, setting
collision energies, and intelligently scaling ion injection times,
we see a 10-fold increase in TMT reporter ion intensities with the
MultiNotch MS3 approach, relative to the standard MS3 scan type (Figure 3).

On the basis of the success of this work,
Thermo Scientific has
implemented a MultiNotch MS3 method. This method also captures multiple
MS2 fragment ions in the MS3 precursor population using isolation
waveforms with multiple frequency notches (i.e., synchronous precursor
selection). They have implemented this method on the Orbitrap Fusion
mass spectrometer. Preliminary data collected using the Orbitrap Fusion
matches with the trends presented in this manuscript, i.e., that MS2-based
measurements of TMT ratios are inaccurate due to the coisolation and
cofragmentation of interfering ions and that the MultiNotch MS3 method
effectively counters these interfering signals (Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). We also observed that
improvements in parallel ion processing and active ion management
dramatically reduce the scan overhead associated with MS3 analysis.
We are currently preparing a manuscript that further details the performance
characteristics of this instrument.
