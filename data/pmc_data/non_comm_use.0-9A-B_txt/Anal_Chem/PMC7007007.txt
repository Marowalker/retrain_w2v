Understanding
protein structure is vital for evaluating protein
interactions with drugs, proteins, and other ligands. Native mass
spectrometry (MS) is proving to be invaluable for this purpose, enabling
analysis of “native-like” samples that mimic physiological
conditions. Native MS is usually performed by electrospray ionization
(ESI) with its soft ionization processes and the generation of multiply
charged ions proving favorable for conformation retention and high
mass analysis, respectively. There is scope to expand the currently
available toolset, specifically to other soft ionization techniques
such as soft laser desorption, for applications in areas like high-throughput
screening and MS imaging. In this Letter, observations made from native
MS experiments using an ultraviolet (UV) laser-based ion source operating
at atmospheric pressure are described. The ion source is capable of
producing predominately multiply charged ions similar to ESI. Proteins
and protein complexes were analyzed from a native-like sample droplet
to investigate the technique. Ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS)
measurements showed that folded protein conformations were detected
for ions with low charge states. This observation indicates the source
is suitable for native MS analysis and should be further developed
for higher mass analysis in the future.

==== Body
The soft
ionization techniques
electrospray ionization (ESI) and nanoESI are used extensively for
analysis of samples in “native-like” conditions by mass
spectrometry (native MS). Samples are analyzed from solutions that
mimic a physiological environment.1 The
ion source is operated at atmospheric pressure (AP), where ions in
the spray are cooled, and solvent molecules are removed from the analyte
ions by gentle collisions with gaseous molecules. Low emitter voltages
are used, with narrow-bore (<5 μm internal diameter) emitters
aiding sample desalting.1,2 This limits the internal
energy gain and unfolding of protein ions as they are passed from
solution into the gas phase and the vacuum of the mass spectrometer.
Protein structures, as present under physiological conditions, may
be preserved. This is particularly important for ion mobility-mass
spectrometry (IM-MS) instruments, which are capable of gas-phase evaluation
of the 3-dimensional protein ion structure.3,4 Values
for collisional cross sections (CCSs) may be determined from IM-MS
experiments, allowing ion conformations to be compared between systems
and techniques.

Other ion sources are being adopted for native
MS. Desorption electrospray
ionization (DESI) has shown promise, allowing the lifting of complexes
from a planar surface by a charged solvent beam and subsequent analysis
by MS.5 Similarly, liquid extraction surface
analysis (LESA) has been demonstrated for the analysis of native proteins
directly from tissue sections.6

Native
MS has also been described with laser-based ion sources.
Like ESI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MS has
been used to analyze proteins since the late 1980s7 and to detect noncovalent protein complexes and intact
quaternary protein structures.8 The typical
solid-state MALDI samples predominantly produce singly charged ions
and are thus usually analyzed using high mass range TOF analyzers.
However, multiply charged ions may be produced using an AP ion source
and liquid samples.9 In the case of ultraviolet
(UV)-MALDI, the use of typically acidic liquid support matrices (LSMs)
produces highly charged ions in the positive ion mode, while basic
LSMs are beneficial for producing highly charged ions in the negative
ion mode.10 Proteins as large as apo-transferrin
(approximately 80 kDa) have been analyzed in this way.11 However, these sample conditions are not suitable
for native MS. Beaufour et al. were able to demonstrate native-like
analysis using a high vacuum MALDI source with an ionic liquid matrix
made up of an organic acid, organic base, and glycerol.12 The protein ions formed were largely singly
charged, as expected of the instrumentation used, in the m/z range of 9000–20 000. This is beyond
the optimal m/z range of many commercial
high-performance mass spectrometers, such as QTOF and hybrid Orbitrap
instruments (although the options for high m/z analysis have improved over the past decade), and thus,
the available MS/MS techniques, mass resolution, and accuracy as well
as access to IM-MS are limited.

A mixture of native and denatured
states was observed by Lu et
al. with the desorption by impulsive vibrational excitation (DIVE-MS)
setup.13 The employed system used a picosecond
infrared laser (PIRL) to ablate material from a liquid sample. Native-like
protein analysis was demonstrated but did not feature ion mobility
measurements. Other studies have made use of lasers for sample vaporization
but relied on ESI post-ionization. These laser ablation electrospray
ionization (LAESI) systems have been shown to preserve the protein
native state and have higher tolerance to salts than ESI alone.14,15

In this Letter, we demonstrate native MS analysis of the monomeric
protein hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) and other proteins using a simple
AP-MALDI ion source with a low-cost UV laser, generating multiply
charged MALDI protein ions on a commercial high-performance QTOF instrument
with ion mobility separation. A material ejection phenomenon resulting
from the interaction of the laser with the sample plate was exploited
to allow the vaporization of liquid samples not usually compatible
with UV MALDI analysis.

Materials and Methods
Bovine ubiquitin,
horse heart myoglobin, hen egg white lysozyme
(HEWL), jack-bean concanavilin A (ConA), 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid
(DHB), ammonium acetate, and ethylene glycol were bought from Sigma-Aldrich
(Gillingham, UK). HPLC grade water and acetonitrile were bought from
Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, UK). Sodium iodide solution (2 μg/μL)
was obtained from Waters (Manchester, UK). Nitrogen, argon, and helium
gases (all >99.99% pure) were obtained from Air Liquide UK Ltd.
(Stoke-on-Trent,
UK).

The neutral liquid MALDI matrix (neutral matrix) consisted
of ethylene
glycol dissolved in an aqueous ammonium acetate solution (200 mM)
in a ratio of 3:5 (v/v), resulting in a pH value of approximately
7. The acidic liquid MALDI matrix (acidic matrix) was DHB dissolved
at a concentration of 25 mg/mL in water/acetonitrile/ethylene glycol
(3:7:6; v/v/v) with a pH value of approximately 2, which has previously
been demonstrated to produce highly protonated protein ions.10,11 Sodium iodide solution was used as provided for calibration of the
TOF analyzer in the m/z range of
100–8000 by AP-LDI. A volume of 500 nL of the sodium iodide
solution was spotted with 500 nL of ethylene glycol/water (3:5; v/v)
and analyzed by ablating material from the droplet edge. For calibration
of the TWIMS cell, ubiquitin and myoglobin were dissolved to 200 pmol/μL
in 0.1% formic acid. A volume of 500 nL of protein solution was spotted
on the MALDI target plate with 500 nL of the acidic matrix solution
to give an in-droplet amount of 100 pmol of protein. The actual sample
volume was less than 1 μL due to some evaporation of solvents.
Proteins were dissolved to 200 pmol/μL, except ConA which was
dissolved to 10 pmol/μL, in an aqueous ammonium acetate solution
(200 mM) and spotted in equal volumes with the neutral matrix to give
an in-droplet amount of 100 pmol (5 pmol for ConA) for native-like
analysis.

A custom AP-MALDI ion source was attached to a Synapt
G2-Si (Waters)
as detailed previously.16 Briefly, a pulsed
UV laser (337 nm, 1–30 Hz repetition rate, 3 ns pulse duration,
approximately 20 μJ per pulse) was mounted atop the mass spectrometer,
and the beam was directed through a lens with a focal length of 150
mm onto the stainless-steel MALDI target plate. A potential of 3 kV
was applied to the MALDI target plate with approximately 5 mm between
the target plate surface and the instrument’s inlet. The inlet
ion transfer tube was operated at approximately 100 °C without
counter-flow gas. The ion block temperature was set to 80 °C,
and the cone voltage was set to 30–40 V for best analyte ion
signal intensity. The mass spectrometer was operated in “positive
ion mode”, “ion mobility-TOF”, and “sensitivity”
mode. The backing pressure was approximately 2.6 mbar. Data were collected
over the m/z range of 100–5000
with an automatic quadrupole profile and TOF scan duration of 1 s.
The collision cell gas was argon, providing a pressure of approximately
2.3 × 10–2 mBar in the trap and transfer cells,
raised to 3.2 × 10–2 mBar for native myoglobin
and ConA analysis. Helium was provided to the helium cell to give
a pressure of approximately 3.8 mbar. The TWIMS drift gas was nitrogen,
resulting in a pressure of approximately 2.6 mbar in the TWIMS device.
The normalized collision potential applied in the trap cell was 4
V and in the transfer cell was 30 V. The IM wave velocity was 650
m/s with a wave height of 40 V. The trap DC bias was set between 40
and 45 V. Settings were unchanged between the calibration and analysis
steps, and the instrument was kept in the “Operate”
state between analyses to maintain stable pressures, temperatures,
and voltages. Laboratory temperature was approximately 20 °C.
Full IM-MS parameters as recorded by the instrument can be found in
the “_extern.inf” file included with each raw datafile.
These are available in the University of Reading’s Research
Data Archive.

Calibration of the TWIMS cell was performed by
liquid AP-MALDI
IM-MS analysis (IM settings as described above) of ubiquitin and apo-myoglobin
using the acidic matrix, with reference to published protocols and DTCCSN2 values of denatured proteins analyzed by
ESI drift tube ion mobility-MS.4,17 Calculations were performed
using the CCS calculation spreadsheet by Hofmann and Pagel (https://www.bcp.fu-berlin.de/en/chemie/chemie/forschung/OrgChem/pagel/resources/research/CCS_calibration_spreadsheet_2014.xlsx). The arrival time (in ms), obtained from the apex of the most intense
mobility peak, was determined for each charge state using Driftscope
2.8 and MassLynx 4.1 (Waters). Corrected drift time (dt′) was
calculated with eq 1: 1  where C is
the enhanced duty cycle (EDC) delay coefficient (1.41 ms) and dt is
the measured arrival time. Corrected CCS (CCS′) was calculated
with eq 2: 2  where CCS is the calibrant
literature CCS value, μ is the ions’ reduced mass, and z is the ion charge state. A logarithmic fit was applied
to a plot of ln(CCS′) vs ln(dt′), with a coefficient
of determination R2 = 0.9955. New corrected
drift times (dt″) were obtained by eq 3: 3  where x is
the slope of the log plot. TWCCSN2 (CCS obtained
using a traveling wave device under N2) were then calculated
as the product of dt″ and the log plot constant (A). CCSN2 values were also calculated by the trajectory
method (TM) in IMoS 1.09 from crystal structure data.18 Where applicable, spectrum deconvolution was performed
with UniDec (version 3.2.0; Oxford, UK).19 Collision-induced unfolding plots in the Supporting Information were produced with ORIGAMI (version 1.2.1.4; Manchester,
UK).20

Results and Discussion
It is first important to note that, for the analyses performed
with the acidic matrix, the laser could be focused at any point on
the droplet to detect analyte ion signal. However, the best total
ion count was usually achieved from the center of the droplet. When
analyzing a sample not containing a UV-MALDI chromophore, it was necessary
to focus the laser on the droplet edge in order to cause effective
ablation. Figure S1 shows a photograph
of a stream of ablated droplets across the MALDI target plate surface,
often seen when analyzing a neutral pH sample in this way.

Ubiquitin
was analyzed with the acidic and neutral matrices. The
acidic matrix resulted in highly charged ions with a wide charge state
distribution (CSD) suitable for calibration of the TWIMS data (Figure S2a). The neutral matrix predominantly
resulted in 5+ and 6+ analyte ions (Figure S2b). Investigation of the ion arrival
time distributions (ATDs) for the 4+, 5+, and
6+ charge states (Figure S2c–e, respectively) revealed multiple conformations. Some more folded
conformations were detected as revealed by TWCCSN2 for each ATD peak and comparison to previously reported values.21

Figure 1a shows
a typical liquid AP-MALDI mass spectrum for HEWL when analyzed with
the acidic matrix, while Figure 1b shows a spectrum produced with the neutral matrix.
In general, the most intense charge state observed was [M + 11H]11+ for the acidic matrix, but [M + 8H]8+ for the
“native-like” neutral pH sample where lower charge states
were favored.

Figure 1 AP-(MA)LDI mass spectra for HEWL (100 pmol per droplet)
from liquid
samples. (a) Charge states up to 15+ were detected for
a sample prepared with a DHB/ethylene glycol-based liquid matrix (approximately
pH 2). The inset spectrum shows the adduct ions detected for the 11+ charge state. (b) A “native-like” sample using
a matrix with 200 mM ammonium acetate and no UV MALDI chromophore
(approximately pH 7) resulted in lower charge states being detected.
The inset spectrum shows the adduct ions detected for the 8+ charge state.

Interestingly, the most intense
ion signal, besides [M + nH]n+, for the “native-like”
sample is [M + Fe(II) + (n – 2)H]n+. Iron is most likely derived from the stainless-steel
MALDI target plate. The observed adduct ions are probably formed within
the laser-ablated liquid microdroplets as they are desolvated. Iron
may coordinate with, and reversibly inactivate, lysozyme in solution.22,23 No measurable difference in TWCCSN2 was observed
for iron adduct ions compared to protonated ions, suggesting that
iron coordination does not result in HEWL unfolding. The approximate
mass difference between [M + nH]n+ and [M + Fe + (n – 2)H]n+ ions is 54 Da (see Figure S3), indicating a two-proton difference compared to the protonated
molecular ion, thus suggesting the iron coordinated in the 2+ oxidation
state. Interestingly, this contrasts with previous research where
Fe(III) was detected bound to HEWL by ESI MS, perhaps indicating that
the iron ions are located differently on HEWL ions produced in the
gas phase than when allowed to interact with HEWL in solution prior
to ionization.23 Sodium and potassium adduct
ions were also observed. In contrast, the most abundant adduct ion
when analyzed with the acidic matrix is [M + nH +
DHB]n+, whereas the iron adducts were
absent. This is likely because direct laser ablation of the target
plate surface is virtually prohibited by the strong absorption of
the acidic matrix chromophore and small laser penetration depth.

Unlike for the ubiquitin spectrum, the AP-LDI native mass spectrum
in Figure 1b features
more charge states than that of HEWL produced by nanoESI, indicating
the need for optimization of gentler ionization conditions in the
future. In ESI MS, higher charge states are indicative of in-solution
unfolding of the protein and ionization by the charge ejection model.24 However, IM-MS measurements were used in this
study to collect further evidence to confirm the preservation of folded
conformations when detected by liquid AP-MALDI MS.

For each
charge state of HEWL, for which the MS data are shown
in Figure 1b, extracted
ion ATD plots are presented in Figure 2. The charge states 11+ to 9+ (Figure 2a–c)
show peaks indicating unfolded structures, since the TWCCSN2 values are considerably larger than 1799 Å2 as calculated by the TM from the HEWL crystal structure (Protein
Data Bank entry 1DPX).25 The ATD plot for the 8+ ion (the most intense MS ion signal in Figure 1b) features two peaks (see Figure 2d), indicating two resolvable
protein structures. The TWCCSN2 values of these
two peaks (1798 and 2193 Å2) suggest one folded and
one unfolded conformation, with the former value being very similar
to the predicted value. The effect of raising the collision potential
in the trap cell can be observed in Figure S4, where the presumably folded conformation is absent above 20 V.
The additional energy added to the protein ions prior to IM separation
appear to have caused the folded ions to unfold. The lowest charge
states, 7+ (1739 Å2) and 6+ (1662
Å2) (Figure 2e,f), exhibit smaller TWCCSN2 values
than predicted. This again suggests the conformation detected for
each is folded. The 7+ conformation also experienced unfolding
at elevated trap collision potentials (Figure S5). Differences of around 10% in measured CCS values compared
to CCS values predicted from crystal structure coordinates are well
documented for native MS of monomeric proteins.26

Figure 2 Ion arrival time distribution (ATD) plots obtained from the “native-like”
HEWL sample for charge states 11+ to 6+ (a–f),
with TWCCSN2 noted for each peak maximum. Each
plot was generated from an approximately ±1.5 Da window around
the [M + nH]n+ peak.
The charge states 11+ to 9+ (a–c) indicate
unfolded structures, whereas 7+ and 6+ (e, f)
are indicative of folded structures, evidenced by substantially smaller TWCCSN2. The ATD plot of the 8+ charge
state (d) displays ion populations of both conformations.

To investigate whether noncovalent interactions could be
retained,
myoglobin was analyzed with the acidic and neutral matrices. High-charge
state ions were observed for apo-myoglobin when analyzed using the
acidic matrix (Figure 3a), whereas lower charge state ions were produced with the neutral
matrix (Figure 3b).
Peaks for holo-myoglobin, where the heme is bound noncovalently, were
only detected from the neutral matrix alongside apo-myoglobin peaks
(Figure S6, mass difference of ∼616
Da). The holo-form is an indicator for gentle analysis conditions
and the preservation of noncovalent binding in the gas phase. The TWCCSN2 for holo-myoglobin ions (7+,
8+) were similar to previously reported values, suggesting
the complex was detected in a folded conformation.21

Figure 3 AP-(MA)LDI mass spectra for myoglobin obtained from liquid samples
using the acidic matrix (a) and neutral matrix (b). Substantially
different CSDs were observed. The apo-form of myoglobin (Ma) was readily detected for both matrices, whereas the heme-binding
holo-form (MH) was only detected with the neutral matrix
at lower charge states. The relative abundance of heme is also lower
for the analysis under “native-like” conditions. The TWCCSN2 for the 7+ (c) and 8+ (d) holo-form ions correspond closely to previously reported values.21

Additionally, ConA in
ammonium acetate was analyzed using the neutral
matrix. By nESI MS, ConA is typically detected as monomer (approximately
25.1 kDa), homodimer (approximately 51.5 kDa), and homotetramer (approximately
103 kDa) at pH 7. Here, we detected homodimers with a narrow CSD (13+–16+), indicative of native conformations,
and monomers with a broader CSD (Figure S7a). The TWCCSN2 values for the dimer ions (14+: 4313 Å2; 15+: 4300 Å2; 16+: 4351 Å2; Figure S7b) were comparable to CCSN2 values predicted
from the dimer crystal structure, using the Protein Data Bank entry 1GKB (4412 Å2).27 The 16+ ions also
displayed a second conformer (5099 Å2) indicative
of some unfolding. The monomer CSD suggests that some degree of thermalization
may occur during ionization, producing a mixture of folded and unfolded
states. The tetramer was not detectable from the MS data alone. However,
the inspection of the 2D ATD plot (Figure S8) revealed a trace that is potentially attributable to tetramer ions.
The lack of peak resolution is likely due to the currently lower sensitivity
of the AP-LDI method compared to nESI as well as a need to improve
ion transmission and desolvation conditions. Previously, the analysis
of larger proteins (e.g., apo-transferrin, approximately 78 kDa) has
proven challenging even with the efficient acidic matrices.11 Raising the backing pressure of the mass spectrometer
may help to improve large ion focusing and desolvation as is now commonplace
for native nESI MS.

The ejection of material by UV laser irradiation
from a nonabsorptive
liquid droplet is a phenomenon that we have previously utilized to
successfully ionize sodium iodide, for calibration purposes, on the
AP-MALDI ion source.10 Koch et al. have
suggested that the substrate, in this case the stainless-steel MALDI
target plate, supports front sample surface spallation due to rapid
heating of the substrate by the incident laser pulse, resulting in
the ejection of MALDI sample material.28 A detailed discussion of the differences of the various ion sources
and their effects on ionization is beyond the scope of this Letter,
but one common feature is worth noting: the instrument’s inlet.
In this AP-MALDI study, sample material ejected by the spallation
event is captured by the heated MS inlet. It is proposed that the
protein ions detected were essentially the product of “ESI-like”
processes, collisions with gas molecules and the inlet, and the elevated
temperature of the inlet’s ion transfer tube, resulting in
the release of ions into the gas phase.

In a recent article
by Towers et al., it was shown that a heated
inlet was essential for promoting protein ion formation by DESI.29 The DIVE-MS setup also incorporates a heated
inlet for analyzing denatured and native protein samples.13 Comparisons can also be made to solvent-assisted
ionization (SAI), where protein-containing solutions are directly
introduced to the heated inlet.30 The inlet
temperature for SAI is typically higher than what was used for the
AP-MALDI experiments here, presumably necessary due to higher volumes
of solvent introduced. It is reasonable to suggest that the laser
in the AP-MALDI ion source used here plays a fundamentally limited
role in the ionization itself (without a MALDI chromophore included)
but is practically an extremely convenient and highly controllable
method of introducing small, nebulized volumes of liquid sample to
the heated inlet.

Conclusion
This initial report of
native-like sample analysis with a UV-AP-MALDI
ion source presents an alternative to the usual ESI MS methodologies
used for native MS. It offers the ability to analyze low sample volumes
and does not require substantial modification to native MS sample
preparation. Liquid MALDI has also been shown to be more flexible
and tolerant toward contaminants and changes in the sample environment,
potentially further widening the range of comparative analyses of
various possible protein conformations that depend on the (sample)
environment.31,32 AP-MALDI ion sources are appropriate
for high-throughput analysis, for applications such as screening.
This ion source requires further development for the analysis of much
larger proteins and complexes, as shown by the lack of signal for
the ConA tetramer. MALDI is also an established MS imaging technique,
and a modified AP-LDI setup could be further investigated as a laser-based
native MS imaging platform. Additional modifications could include
the addition of a picosecond infrared laser to ablate the sample droplet
easily, since water would act as a chromophore, and with limited heating
of the sample. This might lead to sensitivity gains, easy high-throughput
analysis, and the analysis of much larger analytes.
