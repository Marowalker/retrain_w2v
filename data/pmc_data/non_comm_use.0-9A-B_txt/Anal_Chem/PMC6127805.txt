Protein
aggregation is a key molecular feature underlying a wide
array of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s
and Parkinson’s diseases. To understand protein aggregation
in molecular detail, it is crucial to be able to characterize the
array of heterogeneous aggregates that are formed during the aggregation
process. We present here a high-throughput method to detect single
protein aggregates, in solution, from a label-free aggregation reaction,
and we demonstrate the approach with the protein associated with Parkinson’s
disease, α-synuclein. The method combines single-molecule confocal
microscopy with a range of amyloid-binding extrinsic dyes, including
thioflavin T and pentameric formylthiophene acetic acid, and we show
that we can observe aggregates at low picomolar concentrations. The
detection of individual aggregates allows us to quantify their numbers.
Furthermore, we show that this approach also allows us to gain structural
insights from the emission intensity of the extrinsic dyes that are
bound to aggregates. By analyzing the time evolution of the aggregate
populations on a single-molecule level, we then estimate the fragmentation
rate of aggregates, a key process that underlies the multiplication
of pathological aggregates. We additionally demonstrate that the method
permits the detection of these aggregates in biological samples. The
capability to detect individual protein aggregates in solution opens
up a range of new applications, including exploiting the potential
of this method for high-throughput screening of human biofluids for
disease diagnosis and early detection.

==== Body
Self-assembly
of amyloidogenic
proteins underlies a multitude of neurodegenerative disorders, such
as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease (PD).
Aggregation of the intrinsically disordered intracellular protein
α-synuclein (αS) into Lewy bodies,1−3 the pathological
hallmark of PD, plays a central role in the pathogenesis of this disease
and other synucleinopathies.1,4,5 The soluble aggregates, known as oligomers, of αS have increasingly
been demonstrated to be the most cytotoxic species associated with
PD6−8 and are therefore of particular interest for comprehensive characterization.
Due to the heterogeneity and low abundance of oligomers, single-molecule
techniques are well-suited to quantitatively investigate the kinetics
of αS aggregation.

By covalently labeling monomeric amyloidogenic
proteins prior to
aggregation, single-molecule fluorescence techniques have been used
to track the aggregation kinetics of these proteins and obtain information
on the size and structure of the intermediate oligomeric species arising.
Two-color coincidence detection (TCCD)9 and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET)10 have provided robust data sets used to produce
in vitro experimentally derived kinetic models for the aggregation
of amyloidogenic proteins such as αS6,11,12 and tau.13 However,
the intrinsic labeling of proteins has its drawbacks. At worst, the
protein’s propensity to aggregate may be modified and the kinetics
altered.14 Other potential issues include
off-target labeling, labeling inefficiencies, and the inability to
remove all free dye.15 In addition, modification
of the overall charge of the molecule, or addition of hydrophobic
fluorophores, may lead to increased binding of the sample to surfaces,
altering the effective concentration of the species over time. Moreover,
it is more difficult to image oligomers in their native environment
if intrinsic labeling is required.

A single-molecule total internal
reflection fluorescence microscopy
(TIRFM) method has recently been developed to detect surface-immobilized
individual aggregates of αS, amyloid β, and tau without
covalently attached (intrinsic) labels. This was used to investigate
the number of αS aggregates in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples
from PD patients in comparison with controls.16 This technique does not require a dye to be conjugated to the protein
of interest but instead relies upon the utilization of the benzothiazole
salt dye thioflavin T (ThT), which binds to the β-sheet structure
of protein aggregates.17,18 Upon binding, the quantum yield
of the dye dramatically increases by multiple orders of magnitude
(e.g., from 10–4 to 0.83 with insulin fibrils),19 allowing it to be added at concentrations above
the dissociation constant to provide high signal-to-background fluorescence.
The major drawback of TIRFM for the study of protein aggregation is
the differential adsorption of oligomers of different sizes or structures
to the glass surface.20 Therefore, artifacts
from surface effects that alter the apparent aggregation kinetics
cannot be ruled out. The low data throughput of TIRFM is another drawback,
which can be vastly improved upon by using techniques compatible with
sample flow.

Here the evolution of aggregates, formed from unlabeled
protein
in solution, is tracked by probing aliquots taken at different time
points via single-molecule confocal microscopy with four different
extrinsic dyes. This novel confocal technique has the ability to reliably
track the number of aggregates present, without the need for surface
immobilization, and does not require intrinsic labels. By aggregating
proteins label-free and only adding extrinsic dyes to aliquots taken
at set time points, we avoid perturbing the aggregation process. Using
microfluidics, we flow samples through the probe volume of a single-molecule
confocal microscope to measure individual aggregates at a high detection
rate, as previously reported for intrinsically labeled samples.11 We monitor the number of dye-active aggregates
over time and the intensity of each species. In our system, the latter
parameter can be related to the β-sheet content and other structural
elements of these species to which the particular dye is sensitive,
and we show that these data are consistent with corresponding TIRFM
measurements.

While ThT is the dye most commonly used to track
protein aggregation
under ensemble conditions, there are a growing number of amyloid-specific
dyes being proposed as alternatives.21 We
tested four extrinsic dyes: ThT, a dimer derivative of ThT, diThT-PEG2
(diThT),22 pentameric formylthiophene acetic
acid (pFTAA),23−25 and PicoGreen.26 Their
structures are illustrated in Figure 1. There is limited evidence to suggest that these extrinsic
dyes, including ThT, may increase the formation of fibrils in the
aggregation of certain amyloidogenic proteins.27 This underlines the advantages of label-free aggregation
with our technique where the dyes are added to extracted aliquots
at different time points of the aggregation. We investigate the compatibility
of our technique with these various dyes and determine which possess
the greatest advantages to probe protein aggregation.

Experimental Section
Preparation of Dye Solutions
Thioflavin
T
Stock solution was prepared by dissolving
ThT (Sigma–Aldrich) in Tris buffer [25 mM 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol
and 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4] to give a solution of ∼100 μM.
The exact concentration of this stock solution was determined by measuring
absorbance at 412 nm (NanoDrop 2000c UV–vis spectrophotometer,
Thermo Scientific), using an extinction coefficient of 36 000
M–1·cm–1.

Thioflavin
T Dimer
Stock solution was prepared by diluting
diThT-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chloride salt (Peakdale Molecular,
custom synthesis) in dimethyl sulfoxide and further diluting in Tris
buffer (25 mM Tris and 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). A fresh solution was
prepared for each aggregation experiment (filtered through 0.02 μm
filter, Whatman), with the exact concentration of this stock solution
being determined by measuring absorbance at 410 nm, using an extinction
coefficient of 45 800 M–1·cm–1.

Pentameric Formylthiophene Acetic Acid
Solutions of
either 1 mM or 30 nM were prepared by diluting a concentrated stock
solution in Tris buffer (25 mM Tris and 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) (filtered
through 0.02 μm filter, Whatman).

PicoGreen
Since
the concentration of the provided PicoGreen
sample (Quant-IT PicoGreen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was withheld
for commercial reasons, it was decided to refer to the concentration
of PicoGreen as a dilution factor from the original neat solution.
PicoGreen solutions were prepared by diluting the neat sample by a
factor of 300 in Tris buffer (25 mM Tris and 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4)
(filtered through 0.02 μm filter, Whatman).

α-Synuclein
Expression
and Purification
Full-length wild-type αS
was expressed and purified based on the protocol by Hoyer et al.,28 and provided as aliquots (200–300 μM,
Tris, pH 7.6) stored at −80 °C.

Aggregation
Monomeric
wild-type αS was prepared
in Tris buffer (25 mM Tris and 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) with 0.02% (w/v)
NaN3 to give a total protein concentration of 70 μM
in a sample volume of 300 μL. The aggregation mixtures were
incubated at 37 °C either with constant shaking at 200 rpm (New
Brunswick Scientific Innova 43), or with constant stirring at 1100
rpm (Micro 8 × 1.5 mm stirrer bar, VWR) in a water bath (Star
Lab magnetic stirrer with heating).

Single-Molecule Confocal
Measurements
Label-free protein
monomer was incubated under aggregating conditions, as described earlier.
Aliquots were taken at regular time points and immediately diluted
to nanomolar concentrations (20 nM) in buffer with the chosen extrinsic
dye. Diluted protein samples were withdrawn through a single-channel
microfluidic device (width = 100 μm, height = 25 μm, length
= 1 cm), at a flow velocity of 0.56 cm·s–1 to
a syringe (1 mL, HSW, Normject) via polyethylene tubing (0.38 mm i.d.,
Intramedic). Flow control was achieved with syringe pumps (Harvard
Apparatus PhD Ultra), and the device was placed on the microscope
stage. Single-molecule confocal experiments with pFTAA or PicoGreen
as the extrinsic dye were performed on the instrument described by
Li et al.9 by use of a 488 nm laser (1.5
mW). For single-molecule confocal experiments with ThT or diThT as
the extrinsic dye, an analogous second confocal instrument was used.
In brief, a 445 nm laser beam (1.5 mW, OFL68, OdicForce) was directed
to the back aperture of an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U).
The beam was reflected by a dichroic mirror (Di01-R488/543/594, Laser
2000) and focused to a concentric diffraction-limited spot, 10 μm
into the solutions in a microfluidic detection channel through a high-numerical-aperture
oil-immersion objective (Apochromat 60×, NA 1.40, Nikon). Fluorescence
was collected with the same objective, passing through the same dichroic
mirror, and imaged onto a 50 μm pinhole (Melles Griot) to remove
out-of-focus light. The emission was filtered (FF01–510/84)
and directed to an avalanche photodiode (APD, SPCM-14, PerkinElmer
Optoelectronics). A custom-programmed field-programmable gate array
(FPGA, Colexica), was used to count the signals from the APD and combine
these into time bins, which were selected according to the expected
residence time of molecules passing through the confocal probe volume.
At each time point, data were collected for 10 min (100 000
time bins, bin width 0.2 ms).

Detection Limit of Dye
Measurements
αS was aggregated
for 24 h (70 μM, in Tris buffer, with shaking), since under
these conditions αS was previously shown to be efficiently fibrillized.6 Serial dilutions of each dye were prepared and
added to the diluted αS fibrillar sample, and single-molecule
confocal measurements were made under flow.

Cerebrospinal Fluid Sample
CSF samples were collected
by lumbar puncture from patients who sought medical advice at memory
clinics because of cognitive symptoms. The sample used was classified
as a non-Alzheimer’s disease, normal healthy individual according
to CSF Alzheimer’s disease biomarker results (T-tau, P-tau181,
and Aβ42) that are 90% sensitive and specific for Alzheimer’s
disease, as previously described by Klyubin et al.29 The study protocol was approved by the regional ethics
committee at the University of Gothenburg.

Preparation of Artificial
Cerebrospinal Fluid
Artificial
CSF stock solutions were prepared containing 148 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl,
1.4 mM CaCl2·2H2O, 0.8 mM MgCl2·6H2O, 0.8 mM Na2HPO4·7H2O, and 0.2 mM NaH2PO4·H2O.

Detection in Biological Samples
αS was aggregated
for 24 h (70 μM, in Tris buffer, with shaking) to produce a
fibrillar sample of αS aggregates. This sample was diluted to
a final concentration of 1 nM (monomer concentration), with 30 nM
pFTAA, in both artificial CSF buffer and the previously described
CSF sample (diluted 5-fold). Measurements were performed in triplicate
for each sample.

Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy
Preparation
of Chambered Coverslides
Borosilicate glass
coverslides (24 × 50 mm, thickness no. 1, Brand, Wertheim, Germany)
were cleaned in an argon plasma cleaner (PDC-002, Harrick Plasma,
Ithaca, NY) for at least 1 h. A 50-well multiwell chamber set (CultureWell
chambered coverglass, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was sealed onto the
coverslide, and each well was coated with poly(l-lysine)
(PLL, molecular mass 150–300 kDa; P4832, Sigma-Aldrich) for
30 min. The wells were washed three times with Tris buffer before
10 μL of sample (50 nM) in Tris buffer was applied.

Single-Molecule
Measurements
TIRFM imaging was performed
on the instrument described by Drews et al.30 Briefly, a 405 nm laser (LBX-LD, Oxxius) and a 488 nm laser (MLD,
Cobolt) were aligned and directed parallel to the optical axis at
the edge of a TIRF objective (1.49 NA, APON60XO TIRF, Olympus) mounted
on an inverted microscope (Olympus IX-73). Fluorescence was collected
by the same objective, separated from the laser beam by a dichroic
mirror (Di01-405/488/532/635, Semrock) and passed through an appropriate
emission filter (FF01-480/40-25 for experiments with ThT/diThT and
FF03-525/50-25 for experiments with pFTAA/PicoGreen; Laser2000). Images
were recorded on an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD)
camera (Evolve 512 Delta, Photometrics) operating in frame-transfer
mode [EM gain of 4.4 e/analog-to-digital unit (ADU) and 260 ADU/photon],
with a pixel length of 235 nm. This imaging mode restricts the imaging
plane to within ∼100 nm above the coverslide. Samples were
placed in individual wells and an automated script was run to collect
data with either the 405 nm channel (for ThT and diThT experiments)
or the 488 nm channel (for pFTAA and PicoGreen experiments). Within
each well, the sample was imaged nine times in a 350 μm spaced
3 × 3 grid, and images were recorded for 100 frames with 50 ms
exposure time by use of an automated script programmed in bean-shell
script (MicroManager).31

Ensemble Thioflavin
T Fluorescence Measurements
Fluorescence
measurements were performed on a Varian model Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer
(Palo Alto, CA) in a temperature-controlled cell holder, with a cuvette
of path length 3 mm × 10 mm. Aliquots of protein were diluted
to a final concentration of 7 or 20 μM ThT. The sample was excited
at 446 nm, and emission was recorded from 460 to 600 nm.

Fourier Transform
Infrared Spectroscopic Measurements
Protein aliquots (3 μL,
70 μM) were loaded and allowed
to dry on the measurement surface of a Bruker Platinum Diamond attenuated
total reflectance (ATR) accessory on a Bruker Vertex 70 Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectrophotometer (Bruker Optics Ltd.). The buffer
background was measured and subtracted from each protein spectrum
before curve fitting of the amide region (1720–1580 cm–1) and baseline subtraction were carried out. Deconvolution
of the spectra with Gaussian curves was performed with a Levenberg–Marquardt
algorithm by use of the Opus software package (Bruker Optics Ltd.).
For comparison, all absorbance spectra were normalized.

Data Analysis
Extrinsic
Dye Confocal Data
The experimental output
data were collected by use of an FPGA card and analyzed in Igor Pro
by use of custom-written code. A threshold was manually selected so
as to maximize the number of events while removing the noise. Thresholding
was set for each extrinsic dye individually, then consistently applied
to all time points measured for that dye. The Igor Pro code selects
events above the threshold and calculates the total number of events,
the total intensity of all events recorded over the 10 min data acquisition
time for each time point, and, from these two parameters, the average
intensity of events.

Extrinsic Dye Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence
Microscopic
Data
The image data collected consisted of 100 frames, which
were first averaged (ImageJ, National Institutes of Health) and then
analyzed by custom-written code. This script first removed the modulated
background and camera noise from the averaged images. Intensity was
corrected to a normalized intensity by dividing the intensity signal
above the background by the background. Individual particles were
then identified by establishing their boundaries and fine-tuning size
and intensity thresholds. The length of these particles was calculated
by use of an algorithm in ImageJ that thinned the boundary of the
particles to a one-dimensional skeleton, calibrating the value for
length obtained with the detection limit of the camera (previously
determined to be 450 nm). The normalized intensity of a given particle
is calculated as the sum of the normalized intensity of all pixels
within its boundary. Using this analyzed data, we plot two-dimensional
contour plots of the normalized intensity per pixel and the length
of particles for each time point. This analysis gives information
on how the number of aggregates evolves over time with respect to
their size above the diffraction limit and intensity density, which
may be interpreted as a measure of the compactness of the β-sheet
core.

Results and Discussion
To confirm
that the single-molecule confocal technique is able
to sensitively and reliably detect aggregates down to picomolar concentrations,
we optimized each extrinsic dye concentration using the same fibrillar
sample of αS aggregates. A binding curve of each dye to αS
aggregates (20 nM αS, equivalent monomer concentration) was
produced and normalized with respect to the maximal number of dye-active
species detected (events) and fitted to obtain a value for the dissociation
constant, Kd, of each dye (Figure 2A) by use of the Hill–Langmuir
equation (eq 1):32 1  where θ is the normalized
number of
dye–aggregate fluorescent complexes and [D] is the total dye
concentration.

Figure 2 (A) Normalized binding curves for extrinsic dyes ThT,
diThT, and
pFTAA (x̅ ± σ, n = 3). Error bars represent the standard deviation from three separate
experiments. Kd was extracted for each
dye: 1.37 ± 0.25 μM for ThT, 48.7 ± 8.4 nM for diThT,
and 15.7 ± 3.4 nM for pFTAA. (B) Serial dilutions of the αS
sample were made to determine the linearity of events detected with
concentration. Curves for ThT, diThT, and pFTAA overlap.

The obtained Kd values
of 1.37 ±
0.25 μM for ThT (2.3 μM with insulin),22 48.7 ± 8.4 nM for diThT (34 nM with insulin),22 and 15.7 ± 3.4 nM for pFTAA (142 nM with
tau)24 correspond well with literature
values. At higher concentrations of each extrinsic dye, the number
of events detected begins to saturate and a plateau is reached. The
beginning of the plateau represents the lowest concentration of each
extrinsic dye at which all binding sites on the aggregates are occupied
by that dye. This was determined to be 5 μM for ThT, 500 nM
for diThT, 30 nM for pFTAA, and a dilution factor of 300 for PicoGreen.
These concentrations of dye give the optimal signal-to-noise ratio
and thus were used for all subsequent experiments.

To verify
the linearity of detection of αS aggregates with
the concentration of protein present, serial dilutions of the αS
fibrillar sample, ranging from 0.1 nM to 70 nM, were added to each
dye at its designated concentration (Figure 2B).

Finally, to determine the limit
of detection (LoD), the lowest
concentration at which the confocal technique can reliably detect
aggregates using each extrinsic dye, the limit of blank (LoB) was
determined. Via an approach analogous to that of Horrocks et al.,16 the LoB is defined as the highest apparent number
of events expected when samples containing no analyte are measured,
given by eq 2:33 2  where x̅blank is the mean number of events measured for blank
samples and σblank is the standard deviation about
this mean. If a Gaussian
distribution of signal is assumed, by taking the sum of the mean and
the standard deviation multiplied by a factor of 1.645, the LoB represents
95% of observed values for blank samples.

The LoD is then calculated
from measurements of samples containing
a very low concentration of analyte and the value for the LoB, given
by eq 3: 3  where σlow concn sample is the standard deviation about the mean number of events from samples
containing very low concentrations of protein. The LoD is calculated
by taking the sum of the LoB and the standard deviation multiplied
by a factor of 1.645, since at this concentration 95% of measured
values will exceed the LoB.

Using these definitions, values
for the LoB and LoD were calculated
for the detection of αS aggregates with each extrinsic dye (Table 1). The lowest concentration
of aggregates detectable was determined with the measured size of
the confocal probe volume (1.80 and 1.94 fL for 488 nm and 445 nm
laser, respectively; calculation in Supporting Information). The signal-to-noise ratio was calculated by taking
the averaged signal across different time points, subtracting the
averaged background, and then dividing by the standard deviation of
the background.

a The lowest concentration of aggregate
that could be accurately detected with each dye was also calculated,
as well as the signal-to-noise ratio.

The values for the lowest concentration of αS
aggregates
that can be detected with each extrinsic dye (ThT ≈ 10 pM,
diThT ≈ 2 pM, pFTAA ≈ 4 pM, PicoGreen ≈ 60 pM)
show that PicoGreen is markedly less sensitive than the other three
dyes.

Measuring α-Synuclein Aggregation with Four Extrinsic
Dyes
The label-free aggregation method, probed by extrinsic
dyes added only to extracted aliquots, allows us to measure not only
the number of aggregates but also the intensity of these species over
time. The deconvolution of number and intensity data, difficult to
achieve with ensemble techniques, provides information about the mechanism
of aggregation.

In order to test the ability of our confocal
method to track in vitro formation of αS aggregates as described
earlier, under shaking conditions, aliquots were taken at set time
points and interrogated under flow. Single-molecule measurements monitoring
αS aggregation were performed, using one dye at a time to monitor
the aggregates produced. The number of aggregates was measured as
well as the intensity of each, from which the average intensity at
a given time point was calculated.

It was observed that all
four dyes tracked the evolution of aggregates
as their number and average intensity increased over the course of
the aggregation (Figure 3A,B). The average intensity of aggregates tracked by each dye was
normalized with respect to its maximum value. This normalization of
the average intensity simply scales the intensity values for each
dye independently (Figure 3C), such that we may compare the evolution in brightness of
aggregates detected by each. A difference in the temporal evolution
of the brightness of species would indicate that certain dyes have
a higher sensitivity to different types of aggregates.

Figure 3 (A) Number of species
and (B) average intensity, tracked by each
of the four extrinsic dyes over the course of aggregation of αS
(70 μM Tris, shaking conditions; x̅ ±
σ, n = 3). (C) By normalizing the average intensity
of species data with respect to the maximum for each dye, we observe
a shorter lag time for aggregations tracked by pFTAA and PicoGreen.

The data show that ThT and diThT
are similar in both the number
of αS aggregate events they track and the evolution of average
intensity of monitored species over time. This can be expected since
these two dyes are so closely related structurally and thus are likely
detecting the same aggregate species. pFTAA also detects approximately
the same number of aggregates as ThT and diThT. However, from the
normalized average intensity data, we observe that the rise in the
intensity of species increases markedly earlier for pFTAA. This indicates
that pFTAA may be binding most strongly to earlier or smaller species,
to which ThT and diThT do not bind. PicoGreen shares this pronounced
earlier increase in the intensity of species; however, the signal-to-noise
ratio for this dye is much poorer than for the other three (Table 1). There is no clear
trend in either the number of events observed or the magnitude of
their average intensity between the beginning and end of the aggregation
time course for this extrinsic dye. This suggests that PicoGreen is
not a suitable choice for such experiments, where greater sensitivity
of detection for aggregates is pivotal.

The intensity values
acquired by the confocal technique are a gross
measure of the relative size of dye-active species, as larger species
would be expected to incorporate more extrinsic dyes overall. However,
for confocal measurements, there is a convolution of aggregate size
and density of β-sheet content and other structural elements
to which the particular dye is sensitive.

Total Internal Reflection
Fluorescence Microscopic Measurements
In parallel with the
confocal measurements, extracted aliquots
of the αS aggregation mixture at selected time points were additionally
measured by TIRFM. The throughput of the confocal technique is higher
than for TIRFM; for late-stage time points, the rate of detection
by the confocal technique was 80 ± 22 aggregates·s–1, compared to 19 ± 7 aggregates·s–1 by
the TIRFM method. The single-molecule TIRFM imaging technique allows
direct observation and visualization of individual aggregates present
at different time points during aggregation (Figure 4A,C). TIRFM images were analyzed such that
the number of species with fluorescence above a set intensity threshold
was counted, their normalized intensity per pixel was calculated,
and the length of each species was measured. This is illustrated with
two-dimensional contour plots (Figure 4B,D).

Figure 4 Two-dimensional contour plots for aggregation of αS
monitored
by ThT (B) and pFTAA (D) as a function of normalized intensity per
pixel and length (n = 3), with corresponding representative
TIRFM images (A and C, respectively). The contrast was optimized and
fixed for each dye; the scale bar is 10 μm for all images and
1 μm for all zoomed insets. Equivalent data for diThT and PicoGreen
are shown in Figure S1.

The structure of aggregates monitored by TIRFM
can be characterized
by deconvoluting the two properties of β-sheet density and size
of aggregates (above the diffraction limit of ∼250 nm). The
analysis performed provides information on the distribution of aggregate
sizes at any one time and the brightness of these species. The latter
parameter is a relative measure of how many dye molecules are bound
and so provides an indication of the density of β-sheet content
of species of size greater than the diffraction limit.

Two-dimensional
contour plots for the aggregation of αS monitored
by ThT showed a slight increase in aggregate number from 0 to 2 h.
There was then an increase in the average length of species and a
striking change in normalized intensity per pixel at 8 h. This implies
that the structure of species was evolving rapidly in this time frame.
An increase in the length of species below the diffraction limit may
account for this increased brightness per pixel, since the length
of the β-sheet structure to which the dyes bind would be extended
in this instance. However, this augmentation would also be explained
by an increasingly dense β-sheet structure. This latter interpretation
of our observation fits well with the conversion step reported for
labeled αS protein aggregation, where diffuse, transient oligomers
transform into aggregate species with a more compact β-sheet
core.6,11,12 The intensity
did not advance beyond this point, and instead the only parameter
that continued to increase was the average length of species detected.
This is likely to correspond to the growth of αS aggregates
via elongation from this point onward.

The evolution of aggregates
tracked by TIRFM and the behavior of
the extrinsic dyes was broadly equivalent to that observed with the
confocal method, reinforcing the validity of both techniques to probe
aggregates. Further evidence for the validity of our single-molecule
techniques was provided by ensemble ThT fluorescence measurements
(Figure S2) and FT-IR measurements (Figure S3).

Measuring the Number of
Aggregates Gives Deeper Insights Than
Ensemble Kinetics
Unlike ensemble kinetic experiments, which
report on the total amount of aggregated monomer by measuring, for
example, the total ThT fluorescence, our assay also allows one to
monitor the number of aggregated species as a function of time. Thus,
this type of assay is able to monitor effects that are not accessible
through ensemble kinetics, such as the fragmentation of fibrils once
the aggregation reaction has reached completion and the total amount
of aggregated material remains unchanged. In order to demonstrate
this application, the agitation mode with which the aggregation mixtures
were incubated was changed from constant shaking at 200 rpm in an
incubator to continual stirring at 1100 rpm in a water bath. Both
of these modes of agitation induce a shear force on sample particles,
but that of the stirring mode is expected to be of greater magnitude,
hence enabling observation of the fragmentation within a shorter time
scale. The shear force applied to the αS sample can lead to
the fragmentation of existing fibrils. This process speeds up the
aggregation reaction by increasing the number of growth-competent
aggregates, and additionally we expect to be able to directly observe
the increase in the number of fibrils even after all monomer has been
consumed.34,35

The number of dye-active species was
monitored (Figure 5A) by ThT and pFTAA (selected since the two dyes had shown different
behaviors) over the course of aggregation, and the average intensity
was calculated and normalized for each dye independently with respect
to the maximum value for that dye (Figure 5B). The graphs for αS aggregation monitored
by both dyes show that initially the average intensity of species
rapidly increased to a peak at 2–4 h before steeply declining
until 8 h, when it began to decrease much more gradually. The number
of events increased from 2 to 4 h, increased rapidly between 4 and
8 h, and then continued to increase more gradually from 8 h. The lag
time tracked by both dyes was approximately 2 h. Thus, agitation with
stirring leads to a much faster rate of aggregation than agitation
by shaking, as was expected due to the increased shear force from
stirring resulting in increased fragmentation and accelerated aggregation.

Figure 5 (A) Number
of dye-active species, tracked over the course of aggregation
of αS with agitation by stirring in Tris buffer. (Inset) Number
concentration data above 8 h, fitted by use of eq 4 for ThT (dark blue dashed line) and pFTAA
(gray dashed line). (B) Average intensity calculated and normalized,
independently, to the maximum value for both ThT and pFTAA (x̅ ± σ, n = 3).

Furthermore, for these data, there
is some correlation between
the decline of average intensity of aggregates and the rapid rise
in number of species detected. Most likely this reflects an initial
increase in size of strongly dye-binding early-stage aggregates, which
are then converted to mature, less strongly dye-binding aggregates,
leading to a rapid decrease in intensity per aggregate. These aggregates
subsequently fragment, decreasing the average size and leading to
a slow decrease in average intensity.

To estimate the fragmentation
induced by stirring, we investigated
the increase in fibril number after completion of the aggregation
reaction (in this case at 8 h), that is, after soluble monomer has
reached its equilibrium concentration. In this limit, the rate of
nucleation processes is negligible due to the low free monomer concentration,
and therefore fragmentation is the main process responsible for increases
in aggregate number. The number concentration of aggregates, P(t), is then initially given by eq 4: 4  where M is the mass concentration
of aggregates, P0 is the number concentration
of aggregates at completion of the aggregation reaction, and k– is the fragmentation rate constant.

By fitting eq 4 to
the number concentration data above 8 h in Figure 5A, we obtain the fragmentation rate induced
by stirring as (3.4 ± 1.2) × 10–8 s–1 for ThT and (2.1 ± 1.7) × 10–8 s–1 for pFTAA. This rate of fragmentation is comparable
to that of prion protein (PrP) under shaking conditions (1 ×
10–8 s–1) but significantly higher
than for αS under shaking conditions (2 × 10–10 s–1).36 This finding
highlights how the measurement of the number concentration of aggregates,
as achieved by our technique, offers an orthogonal approach to conventional
ensemble measurements, thus yielding information on processes that
are inaccessible in such ensemble studies.

Measurements in a Biological
Sample
To verify that
the confocal technique can accurately detect unlabeled αS aggregates
in a complex biological mixture, we performed experiments in human
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which contains multiple proteins and other
macromolecules. To do this, we diluted a fibrillar sample of αS
aggregates (70 μM, 24 h with shaking) 7000-fold to a final concentration
of 1 nM (equivalent monomer concentration) with pFTAA (30 nM) spiked
in a sample (diluted 5-fold) of CSF from a normal healthy individual.
Under these conditions, the oligomer concentration is approximately
1% of the total monomer concentration, that is, 10 pM,6 close to the reported physiological levels of oligomers
of 1–10 pM.37,38 We measured the number of dye-active
events compared to that of the unspiked CSF sample (diluted 5-fold)
with pFTAA (Figure 6). Additionally, using pFTAA, we compared the events detected in
an artificial CSF buffer with and without addition of the diluted
αS fibrillar sample. The composition of artificial CSF corresponds
to the typical electrolyte concentrations and physiological compatibility
of endogenous CSF.39 Our results show that
the technique can clearly detect picomolar levels of αS aggregates
above background for both the CSF sample and artificial CSF buffer.
This experiment shows the potential of the confocal technique to make
measurements in complex biofluids such as cerebrospinal fluid.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the single-molecule confocal
technique developed
here not only overcomes ensemble-averaging limitations but also permits
measurements of truly label-free aggregation. We confirm the effectiveness
of the technique by comparing with a single-molecule TIRFM method,
and we also investigate its ability to detect processes inaccessible
by ensemble techniques, such as direct measurement of fragmentation
of aggregates.

The use of extrinsic dyes removes the necessity
for covalently
bound fluorescent labels, which disrupt the kinetics of the aggregation
under investigation. By avoiding the need for these intrinsic labels,
we open the way for subsequent studies of protein aggregation, in
vivo or in human biofluid samples, to accurately detect and quantify
aggregates at very low concentration in complex heterogeneous systems.
