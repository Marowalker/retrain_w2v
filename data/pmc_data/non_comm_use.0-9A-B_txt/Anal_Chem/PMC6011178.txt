Nanoscale
channels and electrodes for electrochemical measurements
exhibit extreme surface-to-volume ratios and a correspondingly high
sensitivity to even weak degrees of surface interactions. Here, we
exploit the potential-dependent reversible adsorption of outer-sphere
redox species to modulate in space and time their concentration in
a nanochannel under advective flow conditions. Induced concentration
variations propagate downstream at a species-dependent velocity. This
allows one to amperometrically distinguish between attomole amounts
of species based on their time-of-flight. On-demand concentration
pulse generation, separation, and detection are all integrated in
a miniaturized platform.

==== Body
There is widespread interest
in methods capable of performing complex analysis on ultrasmall sample
volumes such as those encountered in single-cell analysis.1,2 This level of miniaturization however requires a reimagining of
traditional analytical approaches. A prime example is liquid chromatography
in nanoscale fluidic “columns”.3−7 Because of the extremely high surface-to-volume ratios
prevailing here, the traditional stationary phase can be complemented
or even substituted by interactions with the walls of the channel.
Downscaling detection methods poses similar challenges. Electrochemical
methods are particularly well suited since electrodes are readily
miniaturized and mass transport scales favorably with electrode size.8 Electrochemistry has been widely applied as detection
modality in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for at least
three decades and is particularly important for detecting nonfluorescent
species.9−12 However, while separation eases the burden of detection downstream,
electrochemical methods remain susceptible to interfering species.
A wide array of surface based approaches has been developed to mitigate
interference,13−30 which becomes even more efficient in miniaturized systems with higher
surface-to-volume ratios.

Here, we combine these elements and
demonstrate how surface interactions
in nanoscale channels can be used to electrochemically generate, separate,
and detect analyte pulses on demand in a compact integrated device.
This approach, illustrated in Figure 1, allows one to discriminate between nonfluorescent
species in samples with subpicoliter volumes using conventional electrochemical
instrumentation. The actual device, shown in Figure 1a, consists of a silicon oxide nanochannel
(height of 330 nm, width of 5 μm) in parallel with a polydimethylsiloxane
microchannel (PDMS, height of 3 μm, width of 5 μm). This
parallel-flow configuration allows one to create a convective flow
along the nanochannel.31,32 The average flow speed in the
nanochannel is controlled by a syringe pump and is estimated at 24
μm/s flow speed per μL/h pump rate based on the Hagen–Poiseuille
law.33 Two nanogap transducers are located
500 μm apart along the channel, each consisting of a pair of
electrodes embedded in the floor and ceiling of the nanochannel (lengths
of 102 and 108 μm for the top and bottom electrodes, respectively).
Devices fabrication is described in the Supporting Information.

Figure 1 (a) Device before etching of the nanochannel (top) and
etched device
interfaced to a PDMS microchannel (bottom; the image appears grainy
as it was captured through ∼4 mm PDMS). The device consists
of two nanogap transducers (1 and 2), a nanochannel used for separation
(3), a microfluidic inlet (4, arrow shows flow direction), and a microchannel
(5) in parallel with the nanochannel. (b) Working principle, as described
in the text.

In a typical experiment,
aqueous solutions of 50 μM 1,1′-ferrocenedimethanol
(Fc(MeOH)2), (feccocenylmethyl)trimethylammonium (FcTMA+), or ferrocyanide ([Fe(CN)6]4–) and 1 M KCl were pumped at a constant rate through the nanochannel.
The potentials of the downstream top and bottom electrodes were held
at 0.5 and 0 V, respectively, versus an Ag/AgCl reference electrode
located downstream. This corresponds to large oxidizing and reducing
overpotentials, respectively, for all three species investigated.
Thus, while these species have different formal potentials, we do
not exploit this fact to discriminate between them. Instead, redox
cycling takes place between the two electrodes for all three species
with a diffusion-limited redox-cycling current given by Irc(t) = nFADc(t)/z, where n is the number
of electrons transferred per cycle, F is the Faraday
constant, A (= 300 μm2) is the overlap
area between the two electrodes, z (= 330 nm) is
the electrode spacing, D is the diffusion coefficient
of the redox species, and c(t) is
the time-dependent average concentration of the redox species in the
detection volume. This expression also holds under flow conditions
because the transverse diffusion time (∼80 μs) is much
shorter than the transit time through the detection volume (∼0.14
s at the fastest flow rates, corresponding to a Graetz number (Gz)
≈ 6 × 10–4).32 This also ensures that practically all molecules transported through
the upstream nanogap equilibrate with its top electrode since it extends
2 μm further downstream, as sketched in Figure 1b.

The degree of adsorption to an electrode
depends on the interfacial
potential.8,34−36 We exploit this effect
to locally modulate the concentration of redox-active analytes in
the channel. As illustrated in Figure 1b, the potential of the upstream top electrode is initialized
at 0 V (time t1) and then switched to
0.5 V at t2. This causes the analyte to
adsorb further to the electrodes, creating a plug with depleted concentration
in the channel. This plug is advected along the nanochannel (t3), resulting in a temporary decrease of the
redox-cycling current (Irc) when it reaches
the downstream nanogap (t4). As the flow
brings fresh analyte into the nanochannel, both upstream and downstream
transducers return to the steady state (t5). The opposite process occurs when the upstream potential is switched
back to 0 V (t6 to t8).

Figure 2 shows typical
results for all three redox species. Figure 2a,b shows the signals at the upstream and
downstream top electrodes, respectively, for Fc(MeOH)2.
Upon applying a potential step at t2,
redox cycling is initiated at the upstream transducer and a sharp
cross-talk spike is observed in the downstream one. The upstream current
does not directly jump to its steady state level, however; instead,
it increases gradually while the adsorption-depleted plug at this
electrode is replaced by fresh solution.35 The 0.6 nA magnitude of the initial dip in the current corresponds
to only 1.0 attomole Fc(MeOH)2+ adsorbing to
the electrode upon stepping the voltage, illustrating the absolute
sensitivity of the nanogap transducer. Several seconds later, a corresponding
decrease in redox-cycling current is observed at the downstream transducer
as the leading edge of the depleted region reaches its position. Surprisingly,
however, the magnitude of this decrease, 1.06 nA, corresponds to a
depletion of 1.8 attomole, which is larger than that observed at the
upstream electrode. This indicates that additional molecules, now
in their oxidized form, were lost in transit via adsorption to the
SiO2 channel walls.37,38 With continued flow,
the surfaces eventually come to equilibrium with the solution again
and Irc returns to its steady state value.
The reverse process occurs at time t6,
when the upstream electrode potential is stepped downward and molecules
are released from its surface.

Figure 2 Redox cycling currents in the (a) upstream
and (b) downstream transducers
for Fc(MeOH)2 upon applying a square wave potential to
one of the upstream electrodes. The labels t1 to t8 refer to the sketches in Figure 1b. (c, d) Downstream
responses for FcTMA+ and [Fe(CN)6]4–, respectively. (e) Upstream response observed simultaneously with
(d). (a–e) Measured at a pump rate of 30 μL/h. (f–h)
Inverse retention time of oxidized (red) and reduced (blue) forms
versus pump rate for Fc(MeOH)2, FcTMA+, and
[Fe(CN)6]4–, respectively.

Similar behavior is observed with FcTMA+, as shown in Figure 2c. The opposite behavior
is however observed for [Fe(CN)6]4– (Figure 2d). Here, stepping
the top electrode to 0.5 V results in a temporary concentration increase
at the top transducer (Figure 2e), followed by a subsequent increase in current at the downstream
detector. This indicates decreased adsorption of ferricyanide at 0.5
V compared to ferrocyanide at 0 V.

Figure 2f–h
shows the inverse of the retention time, 1/tR, versus the pump flow rate. Here, tR is the time at which the peak current is observed (t4, t8) with respect
to the switching time of the upstream electrode (t2, t6); 1/tR is approximately proportional to the propagation speed
and varies linearly with pump rate, as expected.

Interestingly, Figure 2 shows that the transit
times are different for the three
species. They are also influenced by the potential of the upstream
top electrode, which sets the redox state of the molecules being transported
downstream. This provides further evidence that the redox molecules
undergo reversible adsorption to the SiO2 channel walls
which slows down their transport.33,38

Species-dependent
transit times suggest the feasibility of separating
species in nanochannels. Figure 3 shows results for a 1:1 mixture of Fc(MeOH)2 and FcTMA+ at different flow rates. The amperometric
response in this case exhibits two peaks, each presumably corresponding
to a single species. Measurements with different ratios of the two
analytes (Supporting Information) confirms
the assignment of the first and second peaks to Fc(MeOH)2 and FcTMA+, respectively, consistent with the peak time
data of Figure 2f,g.
The differences in capacity (retention) factors between the individual
species and the mixture are discussed further in the Supporting Information. In summary, competition between the
species for adsorption sites leads to a relative enhancement of FcTMA+ adsorption and a corresponding suppression for Fc(MeOH)2 compared to the pure species at the same total concentration.
Conceptually, the ratio of retention factors for species i in the mixed and monocomponent system can be expressed as ki,mixt′/ki,mono′ =
((1 + a(−1)i−1)/2)ni−1, where i = 1 and 2, ni is a constant for each species i, and a is the so-called dimensionless competition
coefficient. Our observations are consistent with the case a ≠ 1. Combinations of [Fe(CN)6]4– with the other two species did not yield a clear peak signal, on
the other hand, presumably because its opposite response to potential
changes leads to partial cancellation of the signals.

Figure 3 Normalized redox cycling
currents for a 1:1 mixture of Fc(MeOH)2 and FcTMA+ at different pump rates. The scale
bar represents a variation of the current of 20% compared to its baseline
value. The traces have been offset vertically for clarity.

These experiments demonstrate directly the occurrence
of potential-dependent,
reversible adsorption of outer sphere redox species. This can be utilized
to create localized concentration perturbations, enabling a form of
electrochemical chromatography. On the basis of continuous sample
flow and “on-demand” sample plug generation, attomole
analyte quantities were separated in short 20 s retention times. Similar
behavior can be expected in other nanoscale geometries and in porous
materials with comparably high surface-to-volume ratios.

It
has been demonstrated that chromatography in nanochannels can
achieve high retention factors.3,7 The device employed
here, however, did not maximize discriminating power, which can be
significantly improved through geometry optimization (e.g., shorter
control electrodes and longer separation channel; see Supporting Information) and tuning of the adsorption
properties of the channel. This may be achieved in a controlled and
tunable manner by placing an additional “gate” electrode
along the channel whose potential could be tuned to optimize separation.39,40 Finally, we note that the device described can be realized in a
variety of geometries including a needle-shaped microprobe suitable
for in vivo studies.
