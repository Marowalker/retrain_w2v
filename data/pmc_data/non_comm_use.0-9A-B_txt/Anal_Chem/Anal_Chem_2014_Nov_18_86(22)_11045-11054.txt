Binding
kinetics of the multivalent proteins peanut agglutinin
(PnA) and cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) to a GM1-doped
1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) lipid
bilayer were investigated by both second-harmonic correlation spectroscopy
(SHCS) and a traditional equilibrium binding isotherm. Adsorption
and desorption rates, as well as binding affinity and binding free
energy, for three bulk protein concentrations were determined by SHCS.
For PnA binding to GM1, the measured adsorption rate decreased
with increasing bulk PnA concentration from (3.7 ± 0.3) ×
106 M–1·s–1 at
0.43 μM PnA to (1.1 ± 0.1) × 105 M–1·s–1 at 12 μM PnA. CTB–GM1 exhibited a similar trend, decreasing from (1.0 ± 0.1)
× 109 M–1·s–1 at 0.5 nM CTB to (3.5 ± 0.2) × 106 M–1·s–1 at 240 nM CTB. The measured desorption
rates in both studies did not exhibit any dependence on initial protein
concentration. As such, 0.43 μM PnA and 0.5 nM CTB had the strongest
measured binding affinities, (3.7 ± 0.8) × 109 M–1 and (2.8 ± 0.5) × 1013 M–1, respectively. Analysis of the binding isotherm
data suggests there is electrostatic repulsion between protein molecules
when PnA binds GM1, while CTB–GM1 demonstrates
positive ligand–ligand cooperativity. This study provides additional
insight into the complex interactions between multivalent proteins
and their ligands and showcases SHCS for examining these complex yet
technologically important protein–ligand complexes used in
biosensors, immunoassays, and other biomedical diagnostics.

Multivalent
protein binding
interactions have attracted much attention in biomolecule detection,
biological separations, biosensors, and immunological assays.1−6 Multivalent protein–ligand interactions have shown stronger
binding, reduced nonspecific interactions, and increased aggregation
on surfaces relative to monovalent interactions.4,5,7,8 Multivalent
protein–carbohydrate interactions in particular have a significant
biological role in cell trafficking and recognition,9 pathogen attachment and uptake,1,10 and
tumor cell differentiation based on glycolipid/glycoprotein expression.11,12 Although the diverse cellular and analytically beneficial binding
properties have led to much research on multivalent protein–ligand
interactions, there is still much that is not understood about their
complex binding properties, especially at surfaces.4

Most multivalent protein–carbohydrate interactions
continue
to be analyzed with simple binding models that operate under the assumption
that binding is reversible and each binding event occurs independently
without ligand–ligand or protein–protein interactions.4,13 Many studies have shown the interactions between multivalent proteins
and carbohydrates are indeed cooperative in nature7,8 with
strong ligand–ligand and/or protein–protein interactions
that affect the apparent binding affinity. Only a few studies have
examined the binding affinities as a function of ligand density,7 and even fewer studies have investigated the
dependence of binding affinity on protein concentration.14 These previous studies suggest that multivalent
protein–carbohydrate interactions are far more intricate than
simple binding models alone can predict. The ability to more efficiently
and precisely measure the binding kinetics of these multivalent protein–carbohydrate
interactions will provide further understanding of the binding properties
of these complex interactions. Such information would allow for more
effective design of biosensors and drugs that utilize multivalent
protein–ligand interactions. Two proteins that can be used
as archetypes to examine the influences of protein concentration,
cooperative behavior, and electrostatics on the complex binding properties
of multivalent protein–ligand interactions are cholera toxin
(CT) and peanut agglutinin (PnA). CT and PnA are both commonly used
in biosensors and medical diagnostics due to their highly specific
interaction with the most abundant ganglioside in cell membranes,
monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1), making further
investigation of the binding properties of these multivalent interactions
particularly biologically valuable.

Cholera toxin, a pathogen
secreted from the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, is an AB5 cytotoxin composed
of a central A subunit surrounded by five identical B subunits that
form a pentameric ring.7 It is the cholera
toxin B subunit (CTB) that is responsible for binding to the cell
surface via the pentasaccharide moiety of the ganglioside GM1.15 Following attachment of the B subunits
to the cell membrane, the toxic A subunit enters the cell and causes
an elevated level of cyclic AMP in the small intestines that leads
to fluid loss.22 A myriad of techniques,
including fluorescence,2,3,7 surface
plasmon resonance (SPR),16,17 enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA),1 and differential scanning
calorimetry,8 have been implemented to
examine the specific binding kinetics of the CTB–GM1 interaction. Although most of the studies have shown CTB exhibits
almost no nonspecific interactions with membranes without GM1, the reported specific binding affinities range from 106 M–1 to 1011 M–1.2,3,7,16,17 Some of this disparity may be attributed
to experimental differences such as ligand density, incubation time,
and mass-transport limitations. Several studies have found the Hill–Waud
model, a cooperative binding model that accounts for cooperative behavior
between ligand molecules, to more accurately describe the CTB–GM1 interactions as compared to the more common Langmuir model.2,7 However, many studies that examine the CTB–GM1 interaction at low nanomolar concentrations in order to determine
the cooperative behavior require extremely long incubation periods
to obtain an accurate steady-state response. As such, inconsistent
and lower binding affinities are often measured because the data obtained
were limited by mass transport.18 A method
that can measure CTB binding to GM1 for several CTB bulk
concentrations after steady-state equilibrium has been reached would
eliminate mass-transport effects and provide the binding kinetics
as a function of bulk CTB concentration.

Similar to CTB, the
multivalent carbohydrate binding lectin PnA
has been extensively used in bioanalytical assays; however, its binding
properties to various carbohydrate moieties are usually only qualitatively
examined and have been less frequently quantified. Peanut (Arachis hypogaea) agglutinin is a tetrameric lectin
that binds specifically to terminal d-galactosyl groups.6,19 This carbohydrate-free protein is known for its anti-T activity
and is routinely used in serology to monitor polyagglutinability.6,20,21 Its high specificity for galactosyl
groups, with a decrease in affinity from Galβ1,3GalNAc to GalNH2 to Gal, has made PnA a useful aid in characterizing the specific
glycoprotein/glycolipid expression on the cell surface of malignant
cancer cells.6,12 The widespread use of PnA as
a biochemical tool for carbohydrate separation has made it the subject
of much research.4,13,19 Techniques such as carbon NMR,19,22 ELISA,5,23 fluorescence,20 and ultraviolet difference
spectroscopy24 have been used to determine
the binding properties of PnA to various carbohydrate groups, gangliosides,
and glycolipids. However, very few of these studies have moved beyond
the traditional Langmuir binding model used to determine thermodynamic
binding affinity for monovalent interactions, and to our knowledge
there is no study of the dependence of the binding kinetics on bulk
PnA concentration. While previous studies have shown the highly specific
nature of the PnA–GM1 interaction, investigating
the binding kinetics of PnA to GM1 as a function of PnA
concentration would provide additional valuable information on the
intricate binding properties of this multivalent protein binding complex.

In this study the multivalent interactions of CTB and PnA to GM1 doped into a planar supported lipid bilayer (PSLB) are investigated
by second-harmonic correlation spectroscopy (SHCS). PSLBs were chosen
as the binding platform as they mimic the native cell surface where
GM1 is present, reduce nonspecific binding, and allow precise
control over GM1 density.25 The
SHCS technique used for these studies offers the advantage of determining
the binding kinetics at individual protein concentrations using minimal
analyte and, most importantly, under steady-state equilibrium to reduce
mass-transport effects. SHCS has previously been used to determine
the diffusion of large dye molecules and amphiphilic head groups of
long hydrocarbon chains.26−28 More recently, SHCS was used
to accurately determine the binding kinetics of the small molecule
(s)-(+)-1,1′-bi-2-naphthol (SBN) intercalating
into a PSLB.29 The current study is the
first to extend the SHCS technique to detection and investigation
of protein binding at a surface. Use of SHCS to measure the binding
kinetics separately for several bulk protein concentrations, as well
as to examine the cooperative and electrostatic contributions of these
multivalent protein–ligand interactions, provides additional
insight for their use in biosensors, medical diagnostics, and drug
development.

are described in Supporting Information.

Second-Harmonic Correlation Spectroscopy
SHCS has been
described in detail in an earlier publication.29 Briefly, in SHCS the fluctuations in the second harmonic
(SH) signal are measured as a function of time and autocorrelated
to determine dynamic molecular events occurring at the surface. Although
the mean SH intensity is proportional to the square of the surface
density of molecules (N), through heterodyne mixing
of the mean SH intensity and the intensity from individual fluctuations,
the heterodyned intensity will be linearly related to N. The fluctuations observed in the measured SH signal are a result
of any dynamic processes of the molecules within the observation volume
that cause changes in the SH intensity on the time scale of the time
step taken between data points, τ.30,31 For the reversible binding of molecules at a surface, these dynamic
processes can include diffusion in and out of the observation volume
and absorption and desorption of the molecules to the surface.30−32 The surface specificity of SHCS eliminates the contributions from
diffusion of molecules in solution, such that the only contributing
factors to the correlated fluctuations in the SH signal are from the
surface binding kinetics.29

The normalized
time-dependent autocorrelation function, G(τ),
for a typical reversible binding interaction, where any surface diffusion
through the observation area is much slower than the binding kinetics,
will have the form of a first-order exponential decay, given by31 1  where NC is a
normalization constant related to the surface density of adsorbed
protein molecules, [P] is the bulk solution protein concentration,
and kon and koff are the adsorption and desorption rates, respectively. By use of
eq 1, both adsorption and desorption rates can
be retrieved from the autocorrelation of the SH signal of a single
protein concentration, allowing the binding properties to be easily
determined as a function of bulk protein concentration. The equilibrium
binding constant, Ka, which describes
the complete reaction, can then be determined for each protein concentration: 2  Autocorrelating
the SH signal and analyzing
the correlated surface binding events by use of eqs 1 and 2 allows adsorption and desorption
rates, as well as energetics of association at a single bulk protein
concentration, to be determined.

Another advantage of SHCS as
compared to linear fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy (FCS) is that the coherent nature of SHG allows the SH
intensity from individual fluctuations to be amplified by the mean
SH intensity through heterodyning. Since the fluctuations oscillate
around the mean SH intensity, the mean SH intensity in essence acts
like a local oscillator, enhancing the SH intensity of an individual
fluctuation. The overall heterodyned output intensity can be written
as 3  where Nμ and Nfluct represent the mean number
of molecules and the number of molecules giving rise to an individual
fluctuation, respectively. ⟨βijk⟩ represents the average ensemble molecular hyperpolarizability
of the molecules at the surface, where the indices denote the input
(i, j) and output (k) fields, which can be described by any of the three Cartesian coordinates
(x, y, z). The
heterodyning effect will be described in more detail in an upcoming
paper; however, similar heterodyne mixing has been used and detailed
for dynamic light scattering (DLS) and X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy
(XPCS).33−35 Two important properties of heterodyning are apparent
in the above expression; first, the cross-term of eq 3 exhibits a linear relationship between the overall heterodyned
SH intensity and Nfluct, and second, Nfluct is enhanced by Nμ. This leads to decreased noise in the correlation data
as the mean SH intensity increases. As a result, the number of molecules
giving rise to an individual fluctuation, Nfluct, can be very small compared to the mean number of molecules in SHCS
while still being detectable.33−35

SHCS data were collected
for proteins associating with GM1 doped into a 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DOPC) bilayer at three separate bulk protein concentrations after
steady-state equilibrium had been reached. Data were collected for
every pulse of the laser, so that the time interval between data points
was dictated by the 20 Hz (50 ms) repetition rate of the laser. The
fast Fourier transform multiplied by its complex conjugate was determined
for 20 data sets, each consisting of 5000 data points (1.4 h total
collection time). After averaging, an inverse Fourier transform was
performed to obtain the correlation data.

Results and Discussion
Affinities for CTB and PnA binding to GM1 were examined
as a function of bulk protein concentration by SHCS. After an appropriate
incubation time for a steady-state response to be reached, the SH
signal was collected for every pulse of a 20 Hz laser as a function
of time for three bulk concentrations of CTB (0.5, 13, and 240 nM)
binding to a 1 mol % GM1-doped DOPC lipid bilayer (data
shown in Supporting Information). The SH
signal was cross-correlated with itself to extract the correlated
molecular binding kinetics. As most of the fluctuations seen in the
SH signal are uncorrelated noise, these high-frequency contributions
(filtered at 15 times the Nyquist limit) and the first point of the
autocorrelation were removed.36 The resulting
normalized correlation data, G(τ), from the
average of 20 data sets for each of the three CTB concentrations binding
to a 1 mol % GM1-doped DOPC lipid bilayer are shown in
Figure 1A–C. SHCS data were also collected
for nonspecific binding of CTB, where each of the three CTB concentrations
was exposed to a DOPC bilayer that did not contain GM1.
The normalized correlation data of 20 averaged data sets are shown
for each of the three CTB concentrations binding to a pure DOPC bilayer
in Figure 1D–F. To allow comparison
between the noise of the specific and nonspecific correlation data,
the time-zero point of the autocorrelation of the nonspecific binding
of CTB was normalized to time-zero of the correlation data of the
specific binding of CTB to a 1 mol % GM1-doped DOPC bilayer
for each CTB concentration. It is important to note that, before normalization,
the magnitude of the noise of the nonspecific binding correlation
data remained the same for all three nonspecific correlation data,
as the mean SH intensity was the same with no apparent increase in
signal as protein is added. It is apparent from the nonspecific autocorrelation
data that there is no appreciable nonspecific binding as there is
no correlation seen, meaning the correlated events giving rise to G(τ) in Figure 1A–C
all arise from the specific binding interactions between CTB and 1
mol % GM1. The lack of correlated events in Figure 1D–F, when GM1 is not present in
the bilayer, also emphasizes that correlated proportional noise from
the laser and/or vibrations from the optics are not contributing to
the observed correlations seen in Figure 1A–C,
as these contributions would be seen in the nonspecific correlation
data if they were present.37,38 Additionally, in our
previous study in which the intercalation of SBN into a DOPC membrane
was examined by SHCS, correlation data displayed a much larger reaction
rate, approximately 6 times greater, than seen here for CTB. If the
origins of the correlation data measured here were due to correlated
fluctuations in the laser source or detector, the same rate should
have been measured for both studies, which is clearly not the case.29 In the same study, correlation data of a pure
DOPC bilayer without addition of any SBN was also investigated and
displayed no correlated events, further demonstrating the absence
of correlated proportional noise or correlated noise from the bilayer.29

have been normalized to the corresponding specific binding data as
mentioned in the text.

SHCS has previously been used to measure the translational
and/or
rotational diffusion of dye molecules and hydrocarbon chain-substituted
amphiphiles on surfaces.26−28 In order to rule out the possibility
of rotational and translational motion on the observed dynamics presented
in Figure 1, the time scale of such events
was considered for the experimental conditions used in this study.
For example, a FCS study of the rotational diffusion of antimicrobial
peptides found that the correlation function time constant was nanoseconds.39 This is much faster than the 50 ms time interval
used in this study, meaning the correlation data collected here are
insensitive to these fast dynamics. In another FCS study, the translational
diffusion of CTB bound to GM1-doped lipids was investigated
and a correlation function time constant of 6 ms was reported for
a spot size of 50 nm.40 Using fluorescence
recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), Kelly et al.40 determined the diffusion coefficient of CTB in a lipid
bilayer to be 0.12 ± 0.03 μm2/s. If Brownian
diffusion is assumed, CTB would be expected to take a time t to diffuse a mean squared distance r according
to t = r2/4D. For the spot size used in this study, ∼1 mm2,
it would take CTB approximately 2.5 × 106 s to diffuse
through the illumination area. Consequently, this much slower rate
compared to the binding kinetics observed in Figure 1 would not contribute to the correlation data presented here.

Correlation data for the specific binding of CTB to 1 mol % GM1 doped into a DOPC bilayer were fit to eq 1 with parameters kon, koff, and Nc. The
results of nonlinear least-squares regression of the data in Figure 1A–C to eq 1 are shown
in Table 1. The measured adsorption rate decreased
with increasing protein concentration, from (1.0 ± 0.1) ×
109 M–1·s–1 when
only 0.5 nM CTB is present to (1.5 ± 0.01) × 108 M–1·s–1 for 13 nM CTB to
(3.5 ± 0.2) × 106 M–1·s–1 for 240 nM CTB. The decrease in adsorption rate with
increasing CTB concentration seen in the SHCS data might be explained
in terms of electrostatics by using the electrostatic potential map
of CTB shown in Supporting Information.
The binding plane surface of CTB has a positive potential and would
be greatly attracted to the negatively charged terminal sialic acid
of GM1, leading to the rather fast adsorption rate seen
here for low concentrations of CTB. However, as more CTB is bound
to the surface, the neutral top plane of bound CTB would be exposed
to incoming CTB molecules and essentially screen the negatively charged
sialic acids at the membrane surface. As more CTB binds, the attraction
between the negative sialic acid and the binding plane of CTB would
lessen, leading to a slower rate of adsorption as the concentration
of CTB increased.

The results seen for the 240 nM CTB–GM1 interaction
are similar to the kon value reported
in an SPR study by Kuziemko et al.16 (1.27
× 106 M–1·s–1), where the binding of 120–240 nM CTB to a 5 mol % GM1-doped lipid bilayer was investigated, suggesting that SHCS
can accurately predict the adsorption rate for the CTB–GM1 complex. It is important to note that the authors in the
SPR study took extreme precautions to make sure mass transport did
not limit or affect the binding kinetics and as such collected their
CTB–GM1 binding data under steady-state conditions.16 Not only were the SHCS data collected after
steady-state equilibrium had been reached (up to 16 h at 0.5 nM CTB)
but also the SHCS analysis of the kinetics is inherently minimally
affected by mass transport as the diffusion of the protein molecules
to the surface occurs at a much longer time scale (10–8 cm2·s–1)41 compared to the binding kinetics. As has been done in FCS, the difference
in time scale can be used to separate out the contributions from binding
kinetics and diffusion.42−44 The SHCS data and the data collected
by Kuziemko et al.16 produce similar adsorption
rates, as both were collected under steady-state conditions where
mass transport did not affect the measured binding kinetics.

The desorption rates obtained from the fit to eq 1 were (3.6 ± 0.5) × 10–5 s–1 for 0.5 nM CTB, (3.2 ± 0.4) × 10–5 s–1 for 13 nM CTB, and (2.5 ± 0.2) ×
10–5 s–1 for 240 nM CTB. The desorption
rates were all in good agreement with each other and did not significantly
change with CTB concentration. To further verify the SHCS results,
a desorption experiment at all three CTB concentrations was performed
by flowing excess phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) through the flow
cell and monitoring the SH intensity over time (data shown in Supporting Information). The desorption rate
of CTB from GM1 remains relatively constant with increasing
CTB concentration, from (3.07 ± 0.02) × 10–5 s–1 at 0.5 nM CTB to (3 ± 1) × 10–5 s–1 at 13 nM to (3.6 ± 0.8)
× 10–5 s–1 at 240 nM. Additionally,
all desorption rates are close to those predicted by SHCS. The good
agreement of SHCS desorption rates with those obtained through a separate
desorption experiment confirm the ability of SHCS to predict accurate
binding kinetics for surface protein–ligand interactions. To
further verify the predicted kon values
obtained by SHCS and to decouple the closely related fitting parameters
of eq 1, the koff values obtained from independent desorption experiments were fixed
in eq 1 and the nonlinear regression was run
with only two parameters, kon and Nc. The results produced the same values (within
error) for kon and Nc as those shown in Table 1 that were
determined for the three-parameter fit, albeit with smaller error.
Thus, although it is not wholly necessary to determine the desorption
rate separately to obtain accurate binding kinetics by SHCS, it does
lower the error and is a simple way to confirm the SHCS predicted
binding kinetics.

The equilibrium binding affinity was calculated
from adsorption
and desorption rates determined from the SHCS data in Figure 1 by use of eq 2, and the results
are shown in Table 1. Ka decreased with increasing CTB concentration, from (2.8 ±
0.5) × 1013 M–1 at 0.5 nM CTB to
(4.7 ± 0.7) × 1012 M–1 at 13
nM CTB to (1.4 ± 0.1) × 1011 M–1 at 240 nM CTB. The Ka determined here
for 240 nM CTB binding to GM1 is in good agreement with
the SPR study by Kuziemko et al.16 for
the CTB–GM1 interaction under steady-state equilibrium
for the CTB concentration range 120–240 nM, 2.6 × 1011 M–1 (Kd =
4.61 × 10–12 M). Additionally, similar concentration-dependent
protein–ligand binding kinetics have been reported in the literature.
For example, at low wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) protein concentrations
(20 pM–10 μM), WGA experienced a much higher affinity
for its ligand than at higher WGA concentrations (5–200 μM).4,45 This is consistent with the trends seen here obtained via SHCS,
where the lowest CTB concentration has the highest binding affinity
for GM1. The good agreement with literature steady-state
binding kinetic values and previously reported binding affinity trends
demonstrates that SHCS can be used to accurately measure multivalent
protein–ligand interactions at the surface with negligible
mass-transport affects.

To further examine the binding
properties of the CTB–GM1 complex, a steady-state
equilibrium isotherm was collected
for CTB bulk concentrations ranging from 0.22 to 13 nM (Figure 2). At each concentration, the protein was allowed
to reach equilibrium before the next concentration was equilibrated
with the surface. The data collection took a total of 49 h to complete
as the lower concentrations took between 10 and 14 h to reach steady-state
equilibrium. Nonspecific binding of CTB to a pure DOPC bilayer was
also examined and plotted in Figure 2 (○).
It is apparent from the data in Figure 2 that
there is negligible nonspecific binding observed over the entire CTB
concentration range examined, which is consistent with the data determined
by SHCS.

(●) and to a pure DOPC bilayer (○). The solid line represents
the fit to the Hill–Waud binding model. Error bars represent
the standard deviation from two independent experiments.

In a study by Shi et al.7 where the
binding of CTB to 1 mol % GM1 doped into a lipid bilayer
was examined by fluorescence, it was found that the CTB–GM1 interaction fit best to the Hill–Waud cooperative
model. As such, the data in Figure 2 (●)
were fit to both the Langmuir model (eq 4) and
the Hill–Waud model (eq 5). As we have
shown in previous work,46 the simplified
Langmuir isotherm model in terms of SH intensity used to fit the data
can be expressed as follows: 4  where ISHGmax is the
SH intensity at binding
site saturation, Ka is the equilibrium
binding affinity, and [P] is the protein concentration. The Hill–Waud
model in terms of SH intensity can be expressed as follows (detailed
derivation in Supporting Information): 5  where n is the Hill coefficient
describing the affinity of the protein for its ligand when another
ligand is already bound. When n > 1, there is
an
increase in the affinity of the protein for its ligand once another
ligand is bound (positive cooperativity), and when n < 1, there is a decrease in the affinity of the protein for its
ligand once another ligand is bound (negative cooperativity).7 The data in Figure 2 were
found to statistically fit best to the Hill–Waud model by use
of an f-test. The resulting Ka was (3.2 ± 0.3) × 109 M–1 with a Hill coefficient of 2.0 ± 0.5. These results indicate
that there is a positive cooperative interaction between ligand molecules
and that once one ligand is bound by CTB, there is an increased affinity
for CTB to bind to the neighboring ligand molecules. Although both
the Ka and n values determined
here are statistically the same as those reported by Shi et al.,7Ka = (3.2 ±
0.7) × 109 M –1 [Kd = (0.31 ± 0.05) × 10–9 M]
and n = 1.9, the Ka is
much lower than that obtained by SHCS. This discrepancy between isotherm
data and SHCS data is most likely due to the influence of mass transport
on the binding kinetics obtained from the isotherm data of CTB binding
to GM1. Although CTB was allowed to incubate with the surface
for an extended period of time (up to 14 h) and the bulk protein solution
was replaced every 5–10 min, true steady-state equilibrium
was likely not obtained, especially at the lowest CTB concentrations,
where small changes in signal were harder to distinguish. It is true
that continuous flow would reduce mass-transport effects even more;
however, given the incubation time required at the lower CTB concentrations
and the amount of analyte needed, such an experiment would be unreasonable
in terms of the time required to perform the analysis and the cost
of materials. Furthermore, a similar mass-transport investigation
has already been performed by Kuziemko et al.16 at higher CTB concentrations and has shown that the binding kinetics
are drastically affected by flow rate. In the work presented by Kuziemko
et al., which reported the same binding kinetics as SHCS for 240 nM
CTB, multiple flow rates were investigated and an optimal flow rate
was chosen such that the binding kinetics of CTB to GM1 showed no limitation by mass transport. The good agreement between
the steady-state equilibrium results obtained by Kuziemko et al.16 and those obtained by SHCS suggests that the
SHCS data are void of mass-transport effects and provide more precise
results for the binding of CTB to GM1 as compared to the
isotherm study, which is likely mass-transport-limited. Additionally,
as mentioned earlier, SHCS has the ability to determine the binding
kinetics without contributions from diffusion even when data collection
is not done under true steady-state equilibrium conditions, as these
two events occur at different time scales and will appear as two separate
decays in the correlation data.42,44

In addition to
the CTB–GM1 binding study, SHCS
was also used to investigate the binding kinetics of the multivalent
binding protein PnA to 5 mol % GM1 doped into a DOPC lipid
bilayer. The SHCS data collected for PnA concentrations of 0.43, 3,
and 12 μM binding to a 5 mol % GM1-doped DOPC bilayer
are shown in Supporting Information. The
normalized correlation data obtained from the average of 20 data sets
are shown for each of the three PnA concentrations in Figure 3A–C. As before, the first point of the correlation
data and high-frequency contributions (filtered at 15 times the Nyquist
limit) have been removed, as they contain contributions from the photon
shot noise of the detection system. Autocorrelation was also performed
on the average of 20 data sets for PnA concentrations 0.43, 3, and
12 μM binding to a pure DOPC bilayer without the ligand GM1. The normalized correlation data for nonspecific binding
of PnA to DOPC are shown in Figure 3D–F.
The time-zero point of the nonspecific correlation curves were normalized
to the corresponding specific correlation data at time zero to allow
comparison of the relative magnitudes of specific and nonspecific
correlation data. Here again we note that, before normalization, the
noise of all three nonspecific autocorrelations was relatively the
same and oscillated about the same mean SH intensity. There is no
correlation seen in Figure 3D–F, suggesting
that there is negligible nonspecific binding of PnA to a pure DOPC
bilayer for all PnA concentrations studied. As such, the correlated
events seen in the data shown in Figure 3A–C
are attributed solely to the specific binding of PnA to 5 mol % GM1.

DOPC bilayer at PnA concentrations of (A) 0.43, (B) 3, and (C) 12
μM, with fits to eq 1 indicated by the
red lines. Also shown are the autocorrelations of PnA exposed to a
pure DOPC bilayer at concentrations of (D) 0.43, (E) 3, and (F) 12
μM. The nonspecific PnA autocorrelations have been normalized
to the corresponding specific binding data as mentioned in the text.

As with CTB, the normalized autocorrelation
data for specific binding
of PnA to 5 mol % GM1 doped into a DOPC bilayer for the
three bulk PnA concentrations were fit to eq 1 with the parameters kon, koff and NC, and the results
from the nonlinear least-squares regression are shown in Table 2. The measured adsorption rates decreased as the
bulk PnA concentration decreased, from (3.7 ± 0.3) × 106 M–1·s–1 at 0.43
μM PnA to (3.9 ± 0.3) × 105 M–1·s–1 at 3 μM PnA to (1.1 ± 0.1)
× 105 M–1·s–1 at 12 μM PnA. The desorption rates did not change (within
experimental error) with increasing PnA concentration, from (1.0 ±
0.2) × 10–3 s–1 at 0.43 μM
PnA to (2.2 ± 0.2) × 10–3 s–1 at 3 μM PnA to (2.7 ± 0.2) × 10–3 s–1 at 12 μM PnA. The concentration-dependent
binding kinetics seen for PnA–GM1 are similar to
those observed for CTB–GM1, discussed earlier, and
can similarly be explained in terms of high-affinity binders at low
concentrations and electrostatics. PnA (pI ∼
6)47 has a slight negative charge at neutral
pH and GM1 contains a negatively charged terminal sialic
acid, which could repel the PnA molecules from the surface. The electrostatic
repulsion between negatively charged PnA molecules and negatively
charged immobilized GM1 could cause a reduction in the
adsoprtion rate of additional protein molecules binding to the surface
as the PnA surface density increases with increasing bulk concentration.

In addition to the adsorption and desorption rates, equilibrium
binding affinity, Ka, was calculated for
each PnA concentration by use of eq 2, and the
results are shown in Table 2. The highest Ka, (3.7 ± 0.8) × 109 M–1, was observed for the 0.43 μM PnA–GM1
interaction, followed by (1.7 ± 0.2) × 108 M–1 for 3 μM PnA and (4.1 ± 0.5) × 107 M–1 for 12 μM PnA. This decrease
in Ka with increasing PnA concentration
suggests that electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged PnA
molecules and negatively charged immobilized GM1 may reduce
the binding affinity at higher PnA concentrations.

The Ka values obtained by SHCS are
much higher than those typically reported for PnA binding to GM1.6,13 In a study that monitored the binding of
PnA to a 4.8 mol % GM1-doped lipid bilayer on the surface
of a gold electrode by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), the Ka (8.3 × 105 M–1) was found to be 3–4 orders of magnitude smaller than that
found by SHCS.13 However, in the QCM study
the Ka was determined by a typical binding
isotherm with bulk PnA concentration ranging from ∼0.25 to
6 μM.13 For a more direct comparison,
a similar binding isotherm was collected here for PnA binding to a
5 mol % GM1-doped DOPC lipid bilayer by SHG spectroscopy.
The SH signal was monitored over time and increased as the bulk PnA
concentration increased from 0.22 to 12.2 μM, shown in Figure 4 (▲). To keep the experimental parameters
the same as those in the QCM study, multiple injections were not made
and each protein concentration was allowed to incubate with the surface
for only ∼30 min. Due to the slightly negative charge of PnA
at pH 7.4 (pI ∼ 6),47 the data in Figure 4 were fit to the Frumkin
model, which accounts for any electrostatic interactions between charged
protein molecules, and the typical Langmuir model (eq 4). An f-test was performed to determine which
model statistically fit best to the data with a confidence level of
95%. The Frumkin model has been previously expressed in terms of SH
intensity and can be written as48 6  The above equation is similar
to the Langmuir
model with the additional electrostatic term g. The g coefficient describes electrostatic interactions between
charged protein molecules on the surface, where g < 0 indicates a repulsive electrostatic interaction between protein
molecules and g > 0 indicates an attractive electrostatic
protein–protein interaction.48

into a DOPC bilayer recorded at steady-state equilibrium
(●), at non-steady-state equilibrium (▲), and to a pure
DOPC bilayer (○). Lines represent the fits to the Frumkin binding
model (solid) and Langmuir model (dashed). Error bars represent the
standard deviation from three independent experiments.

The single-solution isotherm in Figure 4 (▲) was found to statistically fit best
to the Langmuir model
(eq 4). The Ka determined
from the nonlinear least-squares fit to eq 4 for PnA binding to a 5 mol % GM1-doped DOPC bilayer was
found to be (5.4 ± 0.7) × 105 M–1. This Ka value is similar to that reported
by Janshoff et al.13 for the QCM study
(Ka = 8.4 × 105 M–1) but still 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than
that measured by SHCS.

Since the previous isotherm is most likely
mass-transport-limited,
a quasi-continuous flow isotherm was also collected for PnA binding
to a 5 mol % GM1-doped DOPC bilayer. To account for depletion
of the bulk protein concentration as PnA molecules bound to the surface,
multiple injections were made every 5–10 min at each PnA concentration
in the range 0.22–12.2 μM until steady-state equilibrium
had presumably been reached, as no visible increase in signal was
seen from an additional injection of the same PnA bulk concentration
(data shown in Figure 4, ●). The discrepancy
between the isotherm collected with a single solution of PnA and that
collected with a quasi-continuous flow is particularly apparent at
lower PnA concentrations (Figure 4). This suggests
that the single-solution isotherm data were indeed not collected under
steady-state conditions and therefore gave an underestimated Ka value. The data in Figure 4 (●) were fit to both eq 4 (Langmuir
model) and eq 6 (Frumkin model) and were found
to statistically fit best to the Frumkin model. The determined Ka from the nonlinear least-squares fit to eq 6 was (3.0 ± 0.2) × 106 M–1 with a g value of −536 ±
50 J/mol. This Ka is ∼6 times greater
than that seen for the isotherm not conducted under steady-state conditions
as well as that reported by Janshoff et al.13 Although this Ka is still ∼1
order of magnitude lower than that obtained for the highest PnA concentration
(12 μM) by SHCS, the difference in the Ka values obtained from the quasi-continuous flow isotherm and
the single-injection isotherm illustrates the tremendous importance
of allowing low protein concentrations sufficient incubation time
with the surface in order to reach steady-state equilibrium, which
in the case of PnA took up to 2 h at the low 0.22 and 0.43 μM
concentrations. Further studies of PnA–GM1 adsorption
were conducted under a continuous flow at a rate of 3 mL/s (data shown
in Supporting Information) and showed a
faster adsorption rate compared to the single-injection quasi-continuous
flow isotherm shown in Figure 4 (●),
suggesting the binding affinity from the isotherm is still mass-transport-limited.
It is important to remember that the SHCS data are void of any mass-transport
effects, as the diffusion of molecules occurs at a much longer time
scale than the binding kinetics observed in this study. As such, the
predicted Ka from the quasi-continuous
flow isotherm is lower than that determined by SHCS due to mass-transport
effects.

Despite the mass-transport limitations on the binding
isotherms,
one characteristic apparent from the quasi-continuous flow isotherm
that was not seen in the single-injection isotherm is that there is
repulsion between the PnA molecules, resulting in a better fit to
the Frumkin model and a negative g value. The large
negative g value suggests that there is a large electrostatic
repulsion between charged protein molecules at the surface, which
could hinder binding and slow the adsorption rate as the surface density
of PnA increases. Although this electrostatic repulsion between charged
PnA molecules is reasonable when the negative pI ∼
6 of PnA is considered,47 the electrostatic
potential map was also calculated to further quantify the charge distribution
of surface residues of PnA and is shown in Supporting
Information. Essentially, the entire solution-exposed surface
of PnA has a negative potential, which explains the rather high electrostatic
repulsive constant measured by use of the Frumkin model. Additionally,
the highly negative PnA surface would be repelled by the negative
sialic acid terminus on GM1, which could explain the decreasing
adsorption rate with increasing PnA concentration as measured by SHCS.

The importance of incubation time and mass-transport-limited kinetics
was also demonstrated in a lectin iodination study by Emerson and
Juliano,4 where PnA binding to N-acetylgalactose receptors on Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO)
cells for the PnA concentration range 10–60 μM was examined.
In this study PnA was allowed to incubate with the surface for twice
the amount of time as the QCM study (at least 1 h) and a much higher
PnA concentration was used. A higher Ka of (4.5 ± 1) × 106 M–1 was
measured as compared to the QCM study. Although the reported Ka is similar to that obtained from our quasi-continuous
flow isotherm, it is important to note that the iodination study was
conducted with a much higher PnA concentration range and this could
contribute to the discrepancy in the measured binding affinity. In
the same iodination study by Emerson and Juliano,4 the interaction of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) with CHO
cell receptors for bulk WGA concentration range 5–200 μM
was investigated and found to have a binding affinity of 1.6 ×
106 M–1; however, a similar iodination
study by Stanley and Carver45 reported
a Ka ∼2 orders of magnitude greater
for the WGA concentration range 20 pM–10 μM. These two
iodination studies suggest that the binding affinities of lectins
are highly dependent on protein concentration, which is also consistent
with the data from the SHCS studies presented here. To compare the
results of Emerson and Juliano4 obtained
under steady-state equilibrium, SHCS was performed on 60 μM
PnA (the highest concentration used by Emerson and Juliano) binding
to a 5 mol % GM1-doped DOPC bilayer.

The SHCS data
for 60 μM PnA binding to 5 mol % GM1 were filtered
at 15 times the Nyquist limit to reduce the proportional
noise and were fit to eq 1 with the parameters kon, koff, and NC (data shown in Figure 5). The resulting adsorption and desorption rate determined from the
fit were (3.1 ± 0.3) × 104 M–1·s–1 and (3.7 ± 0.5) × 10–3 s–1, respectively, giving a Ka of (8.4 ± 1.4) × 106 M–1. The Ka obtained from the SHCS analysis
of 60 μM PnA is similar to that obtained by Emerson and Juliano.4 Since Emerson and Juliano allowed PnA to incubate
with the surface longer and at a much higher concentration as compared
to the QCM study, it is likely that the results have minimal mass-transport
effects, and this is most likely why the binding constant of the iodination
study is consistent with that obtained by SHCS for 60 μM PnA.

DOPC bilayer, with fit to eq 1 indicated by
the red line.

The results from this
study emphasize the tremendous importance
of conducting kinetic measurements under steady-state equilibrium
conditions. The agreement between data for 60 μM PnA binding
to GM1 measured by SHCS and data from the iodination study
conducted under conditions minimizing mass-transport effects suggests
that SHCS measures binding kinetics that are not mass-transport-limited.
The importance of eliminating mass transport was also seen from comparison
of the binding kinetics for CTB binding to GM1 measured
by SHCS and an SPR study where the flow rate was such that data were
collected under steady-state conditions. The incubation time was also
shown to significantly affect mass transport and measured binding
affinity, as seen from the PnA–GM1 isotherms conducted
with different incubation times and flow rates. An inherent advantage
of SHCS over the typical binding isotherms used to quantify protein–ligand
interactions is that the nature of SHCS analysis allows the binding
kinetics to be determined with negligible mass-transport effects as
diffusion occurs at a much different time scale, meaning the reported
SHCS binding kinetic values are inherently void of mass-transport
effects. Therefore, the adsorption rate determined by SHCS is not
artificially lowered by nonequilibrium conditions and is ultimately
more likely to provide an accurate adsorption rate for multivalent
protein–ligand interactions at a surface.

Summary
In the
studies presented here, binding kinetics of multivalent
protein–ligand interactions between PnA–GM1 and CTB–GM1 were investigated by both SHCS and
a traditional equilibrium binding isotherm. Adsorption and desorption
rates and overall binding affinity for three separate protein concentrations
were determined by SHCS, while the cooperative binding behavior and
electrostatics of multivalent protein–ligand interactions were
investigated by binding isotherms. The results demonstrate the complexity
of multivalent protein–ligand interactions and suggest the
binding kinetics are dependent on bulk protein concentration. Due
to the extremely high sensitivity of SHG, sigmoidal behavior at low
PnA concentrations was detectable, suggesting there is electrostatic
repulsion between the charged PnA protein molecules. Both the PnA–GM1 and CTB–GM1 studies demonstrate the importance
of eliminating the influence of mass transport on binding kinetics.
More importantly, this study illustrates that, by combining SHCS with
conventional isotherm studies, additional information on the complex
interactions between multivalent proteins and ligands can be obtained.
While a binding isotherm can provide useful information on electrostatics
and cooperative binding behavior of the multivalent protein–ligand
interaction, it overlooks the concentration dependence of the binding
kinetics. On the other hand, use of SHCS to examine the binding kinetics
of multivalent protein–ligand interactions at a surface provides
extremely valuable information on the binding kinetics as a function
of protein concentration. Furthermore, SHCS requires much less time
and analyte to determine the binding kinetics for a single concentration
as compared to isotherm studies. The results of this study provide
further understanding of the binding kinetics of two important multivalent
protein–ligand interactions, which can provide greater insight
into what parameters should be considered (protein concentration,
mass transport, and cooperative interactions) when such multivalent
protein–ligand complexes are used in biosensors, immunoassays,
and other biomedical diagnostics.
