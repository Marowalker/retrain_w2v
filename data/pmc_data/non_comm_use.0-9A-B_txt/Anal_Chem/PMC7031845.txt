Detailed characterization
of complex biological surfaces by matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI)
requires instrumentation that is capable of high mass resolving power,
mass accuracy, and dynamic range. Fourier transform ion cyclotron
resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) offers the highest mass spectral
performance for MALDI MSI experiments, and often reveals molecular
features that are unresolved on lower performance instrumentation.
Higher magnetic field strength improves all performance characteristics
of FT-ICR; mass resolving power improves linearly, while mass accuracy
and dynamic range improve quadratically with magnetic field strength.
Here, MALDI MSI at 21T is demonstrated for the first time: mass resolving
power in excess of 1 600 000 (at m/z 400), root-mean-square mass measurement accuracy below
100 ppb, and dynamic range per pixel over 500:1 were obtained from
the direct analysis of biological tissue sections. Molecular features
with m/z differences as small as
1.79 mDa were resolved and identified with high mass accuracy. These
features allow for the separation and identification of lipids to
the underlying structures of tissues. The unique molecular detail,
accuracy, sensitivity, and dynamic range combined in a 21T MALDI FT-ICR
MSI experiment enable researchers to visualize molecular structures
in complex tissues that have remained hidden until now. The instrument
described allows for future innovative, such as high-end studies to
unravel the complexity of biological, geological, and engineered organic
material surfaces with an unsurpassed detail.

==== Body
Mass spectrometry
imaging (MSI)
has proven to be a versatile tool, finding applications in a variety
of fields including diseased tissue classification,1−4 bacterial infections and resistance,5,6 and drug metabolism.7,8 The main strength of MSI is the
ability to simultaneously reveal the spatial distributions of multiple
molecules in a single experiment from complex biological materials,
typically tissue sections.9 However, the
chemically complex samples typically analyzed bring challenges associated
with the mass resolution and unambiguous assignment of the many different
molecules detected. Due to this complexity, many signals are often
unresolved from isobaric ions, such that generated ion images are
not reflective of one unique
molecule. This is a major hindrance to the study of the biochemical
changes within tissues.

The most popular approach to begin addressing
this complexity is
the coupling of high mass resolving power and high mass accuracy analyzers
with MSI ion sources, most commonly matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
(MALDI).10 This combination allows mass
resolution of many isobaric ion species and direct assignment of elemental
composition, thereby providing insight into the specific identities
of the detected molecules. For lipids that are arguably the most widespread
analyte class studies with MSI,11−14 high mass resolving power and accuracy can facilitate
true identification of sum-composition formula (i.e., lipid class
and the combined number of carbons and double bonds across both fatty
acyl chains), when sufficient to allow separation from isobaric interferences.
In comparison to other biological molecules, resolving lipid complexity
is further complicated by their relatively narrow mass range, with
the majority of signals observed between m/z 700–900.15 Lipids can
further be observed as multiple adducts (e.g., addition of H+, Na+, K+, OAc–, Cl–, or loss of H+) that are entangled with isotopes and
other isobaric species. This results in a highly complex mass spectra
that cannot be resolved with conventional high mass resolving power
(e.g., ≤ 150 000 @ m/z 750).15 Improvements in the achievable
mass resolving of MSI technology is needed to unravel the spatial
distributions of unique sum-composition lipid species that can have
dramatically different biological functions

Fourier transform
mass spectrometers; Fourier transform ion cyclotron
resonance (FT-ICR) or orbital trapping (i.e., Orbitrap) offer higher
mass resolving power and mass accuracy than other types of mass spectrometers
(e.g., time-of-flight and ion trap). FT-ICR mass spectrometers provide
the highest mass resolving power and mass accuracy of any mass analyzer,
with up to parts-per-billion (ppb) mass accuracy, high dynamic range,
and mass resolving power values greater than 1 000 000
in routine analyses.16−18 Mass resolution and sensitivity in FT-ICR instrumentation
can also be improved by the use of absorption mode processing,18,19 although this has not yet been widely exploited for MSI applications.17 In a proof-of-principle study, absorption mode
MALDI FT-ICR MSI on a 9.4 T system provided mass resolving powers
in excess of 250 000 for lipid species observed from mouse
brain tissue.18,20 Several studies have shown similar
high mass resolution on Orbitrap systems,21−23 though additional
difficulties introduced in imaging systems typically report lower
overall mass resolution.24−26 High mass resolution is necessary
to distinguish both nominally isobaric lipids, where common mass differences
of less than 10 mDa15 occur, as well as
isotopic interferences, where mass differences less than 3 mDa occur.
While many lower field FT-ICR and Orbitrap instruments can distinguish
the more common isobaric interferences, they are typically incapable
of resolving mass differences less than 3 mDa.27−29 More recently,
desorption-electrospray ionization-MSI using a 7T FT-ICR system combined
with absorption mode processing and external acquisition electronics
demonstrated resolving powers up to 1 000 000 for lipid
species.17 However, the number of ions
had to be reduced to avoid space-charge and peak coalescence effects,
which reduced the dynamic range by 2 orders of magnitude, and the m/z range was truncated (m/z 765–832). Higher magnetic field strength
mitigates these problems, and enables larger ion populations to be
analyzed, for high dynamic range broadband spectra at high mass resolution.
The method described for DESI at 7 T helps overcome a key challenge
in FT-ICR MSI by increasing the transient length while minimizing
acquisition overhead, helping to balance the desired mass resolution
with practical acquisition times for experiments that typically involve
acquisitions of tens of thousands of spectra. These practical acquisition
times are paramount within MALDI imaging, where the use of volatile
matrices limits how long any single experiment can be performed before
the matrix sublimes from the sample.

Outside of the improvements
offered by absorption mode data processing,
analysis times can be reduced by increasing the strength of the magnet
used for FT-ICR. Mass resolution increases linearly with magnetic
field strength,30 allowing for decreases
in transient length without sacrificing resolving power. In the context
of typically long MSI acquisition times, this improvement can reduce
experimental times by several hours, a significant increase in throughput.
Multiple frequency detection promises an increase in mass resolving
power that scales linearly with the frequency order multiple.31 However, to date this technique has not been
applied to mass spectrometry imaging, though significant progress
has been shown in ESI-based methods, which have reported mass resolving
power of more than 10 000 000 in the lipid range.16,21,32

The key parameters of FT-ICR
that vary with magnetic field strength
(dynamic range, mass accuracy, and ion-number induced frequency fluctuations)
are especially important in MSI, due to the changes in ion yield depending
on tissue type,33 as well as a lack of
control (e.g., via automatic gain control) over the number of ions
entering the analyzer cell at each pixel. Further, the rich information
available within the lipid range sees an enormous benefit from higher
magnetic fields, in part from the biological dynamic range of lipids,
but also from the number of nominally isobaric peaks possible in biological
tissues. The advantage of increased mass resolution is obvious, but
the improvement to mass accuracy and dynamic range can be crucial.
High mass accuracy over long analysis times is important to generate
highly accurate MSI images, as any drift in mass across an experiment
would necessitate either pixel-to-pixel correction for this drift,
or wider mass selection windows for image generation to encapsulate
the ion as its apparent m/z shifts
over time. High-field FT-ICR mass spectrometers offer external mass
calibrations of less than 0.2 ppm (ppm),34 and internal calibration less than 0.1 ppm.35 High dynamic range is a key performance metric for MSI, given the
wide dynamic range of lipid concentrations,36 and differences in the ionization efficiencies of these biomolecules.
Increased dynamic range is important to distinguish low abundance
species while still detecting highly abundant lipids without distortion
in relative ion abundances. The higher the magnetic field of an FT-ICR,
the less susceptible it is to ion-number induced frequency shifts,
which can hinder identification of peaks and complicate calibration
of data sets, as has been described previously.37−39

Within
the field of lipidomics, both shotgun and LC-MS based methodologies
have achieved mass resolution in the lipid range greater than 100 000
along with sub-ppm mass accuracy, enabling assignment of 200–500
lipids in a single experiment.40−42 Due to the increased fluctuations
in signal intensity inherent to MSI, progress toward such endeavors
is slower, success has been shown in a variety of FT based instruments
with numerous ionization techniques, including Liquid Extraction Surface
Analysis,43 MALDI,44 DESI,17 and LAESI.20 LAESI was performed on a 21 T FT-ICR mass spectrometer
which separated the isotopic fine structure of nominally overlapping
metabolites of plant leaves, which improved identification by utilizing
multiple peaks per metabolite in the identification process. Additionally,
the experimental time frame for the 21 T is significantly reduced
compared to other instruments with similar mass resolution, without
sacrificing either signal magnitude or mass range, as has been attempted
with lower-field instruments.17,20,35

In this work, we evaluate for the first time the performance
of
MALDI MSI combined with 21 T FT-ICR MS for biological tissue imaging,
as well as the use of automated annotation to begin exploring the
highly complex information available from such experiments. In particular,
we demonstrate (i) the combined higher mass resolving power and mass
accuracy with the stability of these parameters across long MSI experiments;
(ii) increased biochemical information obtained during MALDI MSI facilitated
by the high mass resolving power and mass accuracy; (iii) single-pixel
dynamic range exceeding 500:1, which enables imaging and identification
of very low abundance ions; (iv) automated analytical tools to identify
potentially hundreds of lipids utilizing thousands of peaks. Combined,
this work demonstrates the high potential of MALDI MSI and 21 T FT-ICR
for studying localized biomolecular processes within tissues and their
disease-induced alterations.

Methods
Materials
Methanol
(LC-MS grade), ethanol (LC-MS grade),
xylene (LC-MS grade), water (LC-MS grade), anhydrous chloroform (≥99.9%
purity), and crystalline norharmane (9H-β-carboline) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) and used without
further purification. Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass slides were
purchased from Delta Technologies (Loveland, CO).

Biological
Samples
Healthy rat brain was obtained from
Maastricht University in accordance with protocols approved by the
Animal Care and Use Committee under Animal Experiment Committee (DEC)
number 2016–006 AVD107002016720. Four transverse rat brain
segments (12 μm thick) were sectioned with a cryo-microtome
at −20 °C and thaw-mounted on ITO-coated glass slides.
Some distortion of the tissue sections occurred during the mounting
process.

Sample Preparation
Norharmane matrix (7 mg/mL) in CHCl3:MeOH (2:1 v/v) was applied to the tissue with a TM-Sprayer
(HTX Technologies, Chapel Hill, NC). Spray conditions were as follows:
flow rate, 0.12 mL/min; N2 pressure, 10 psi; N2 temperature, 30 °C; spray-head velocity, 1200 mm/min; track
spacing, 3 mm; number of layers, 15; drying time between layers, 30
s.

Instrumentation
All MSI experiments were performed
on a hybrid linear ion trap 21 T FT-ICR mass spectrometer at the National
High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) at Florida State University
(Tallahassee, FL). A Velos Pro linear ion trap (Thermo Scientific,
San Jose, CA) was combined with NHMFL-designed external linear quadrupole
ion trap, quadrupole ion transfer optics, and a novel dynamically
harmonized ICR cell, which is operated at 7.5-V trapping potential.34 Briefly, the cell uses 120° cell segments
for ion excitation and detection, for improved excitation electric
field, detection sensitivity, and reduced third harmonic signals.45,46

The commercial ion source and stacked ring ion guide were
replaced with an elevated-pressure MALDI ion source incorporating
a dual-ion funnel interface (Spectroglyph LLC, Kennewick, WA) as has
been described previously.47 Voltages within
the funnels were 625 kHz, 150 V peak-to-peak (first, high-pressure
ion funnel), and 1.2 MHz, 90 V peak-to-peak (second, low-pressure
ion funnel). An electric field gradient of ∼10 Vcm–1 was maintained within the dual-funnel system, with a gradient of
100 Vcm–1 between the sample and the funnel inlet.
The system was equipped with a Q-switched, frequency-tripled Nd:YLF
laser emitting 349 nm light (Explorer One, Spectra Physics, Mountain
View, CA). The laser was operated at a repetition rate of 1 kHz and
pulse energy of ∼1.2 μJ. Pressure within the ion source
was set to 10 mbar in the first ion funnel, and 2 mbar in the second
ion funnel. MALDI stage motion was synchronized with ion accumulation
using the Velos trigger signal indicating commencement of the ion
trap injection event, as previously described.47 The mass spectrometer was operated with an ion injection
time of 250 ms and automatic gain control (AGC) was turned off. A
transient duration of 3.1 s was used for ultrahigh mass resolving
power analyses, resulting in a total time of 4s per pixel. Spectra
were obtained in both positive and negative mode, at 100 μm
spatial resolution. Total number of pixels per brain section were
approximately 22 000, and 24 h of experimental time. A Predator
data station was used for ion excitation and detection.48

Data Processing and analysis
Absorption
mode mass spectra
were generated by phase correction of the time domain transients,49 and peaks with a signal magnitude greater than
6 times the standard deviation of the baseline root-mean-square (RMS)
noise were exported to peak lists. Mass calibration was performed
on known lipid species, with a wide range of spectral intensities
([PC 34:1 + K]+, [SM 34:1;2 + H]+, [PE 36:4 13C + H]+, [PC 32:0 + Na]+, [PC 34:1
+ H]+, [PC 38:4 + Na]+, and [PC 38:4 + K]+) and the data were converted to imzML format using in-house
Matlab routines, msconvert from the ProteoWizard software suite (version
3.0.11537),50 and imzMLConverter version
1.3.51 The ALEX123 software
package was used for sum-composition lipid identification at a search
tolerance of 1 mDa.41,52 All phospholipid classes were
chosen, as were sphingolipids and glycerolipids, with chain-lengths
of 14 carbons or greater. Adducts were limited to H+, Na+, and K+, and negative mode was restricted here
to simple loss of H+. Images generated are normalized to
the total ion current per pixel (TIC).

Results and Discussion
High Mass
Resolving Power
To assess the benefits of
performing 21 T MALDI MSI in terms of mass resolving power, we analyzed
rat brain sections in both positive and negative ion mode using different
transient acquisition times. Figure 1 shows the achieved mass resolving power in the positive-ion
mode using 0.76, 1.55, and 3.1 s transients within the m/z range 785.52–785.6. Increasing mass resolution
shows increasing spectral complexity, as five peaks are resolved from
what first appears to be only two, with two additional peaks within
100 mDa which were sufficiently distinct to be identified at all transient
lengths. We annotated the seven peaks within this region as belonging
to six different species of lipids: [PE(36:1)+K]+, [PC-O(34:1)+K]+, [PC(34:1)+Na]+, [PC(36:4)+H]+, [PC(34:0)+Na]+, and [PC(36:3)+H]+. Of these, four are the 13C1 isotope: ([PE(36:1)+13C+K]+, [PC-O(34:1)+13C+K]+, [PC(34:0)+13C+Na]+, and [PC(36:3)+13C+H]+),
two are the 13C3 isotope ([PC(34:1)+ 13C3+Na]+ and [PC(36:4)+ 13C3+H]+), and the final peak is the 13C18O isotope ([PC(34:1)+ 13C18O+Na]+). These peaks show mass accuracy errors between −50 and 13
parts-per-billion (ppb). Additionally, isotope ratios in the summed
average spectra deviate <15% from theoretical in these seven peaks
(SI Figure 1), offering additional certainty
in that correct sum-composition identification has been made, as well
that there are no convoluted peaks being presented as a single peak.
Deviation from the expected 2-fold improvement in mass resolving power
upon doubling of the transient duration is due to known collisional
damping during the detection event.34 Current
work focuses on a solution to limit transmission of the neutral buffer
gas in the external accumulation multipole to the ultrahigh vacuum
region. Recently, a mass resolving power of ∼600 000
(at m/z 760) for MALDI MSI on a
15 T FT-ICR MS (the highest commercially magnetic field available
for FT-ICR) was reported. This value also deviates from the theoretical
mass resolving power for a 5.2 s transient (magnitude mode), which
is ∼788 000.53

Figure 1 Mass resolution
and sensitivity improve with longer transient length.
Within a 100 mDa mass range, seven different peaks are detected, which
belong to six different lipid species. Of these, five are unresolved
at 0.77 s. While distinguishable at 1.55 s, all seven peaks are fully
resolved only at 3.1 s transient. These seven peaks correspond to
the isotopologues of the monoisotopic species, typically the 13C ion, as in (a), (b), (f), and (g). Other species are also
present, corresponding to the 13C3 isotopologue,
as in (d) and (e). The 18O13C isotopologue of
[PC(34:1)+Na]+ is also resolved (c) from the 13C3 isotopologue of the same parent species.

To further assess the utility of the 21 T, we analyzed the
data
set for peaks with close neighbors (here defined as <10 mDa). We
extracted the 3.1 s transient from a single pixel (number 10 000)
as a representative spectrum from each data set. In positive-ion mode,
a difference of 0.0024 Da (2.4 mDa) at m/z 810 was present (Figure 2a), representing the difference between Na1H1 versus C2 (the addition of two carbon atoms
and three double bonds to the lipid fatty acid chains) which requires
a mass resolving power (m/Δm50%) of 337 000
at m/z 810 to resolve. These two
ions were well resolved, and lipid identities were assigned [PC(36:1)+Na]+ and [PC(38:4+H)]+ with high confidence (100 ppb,
see discussion below). Each species had very different spatial distributions,
with the former ([PC(36:1)+Na]+) being relatively evenly
distributed (Figure 2b), while the latter ([PC(38:4+H)]+) had higher abundance
in the lateral ventricle (Figure 2c). The higher abundance of [PC(38:4)+Na]+ in the ventricles matches with its role as a pro-inflammatory cytokine.54 Interestingly, such a small mass difference
was not uncommon, with a mass difference of 2.4 mDa observed over
190 times in any single pixel spectrum, and more than 1 000 000
times over a single MSI experiment (Figure 2d). Without sufficient mass resolving power,
any one of the images of these ∼190 pairs of closely spaced
ions could yield incorrect assignments and yield a summed spatial
distribution reflective of neither individual species. A variety of
other recurrent mass differences can be detected in the single spectra,
ranging from 1 to 10 mDa, including isotopic patterns (e.g., 13C2 vs H2 is a difference of 8.94 mDa).
The change in 13C2 vs H2 is an important
one, as this denotes the possible overlap for species that differ
by a single double bond (i.e., as PC(34:1) to PC(34:0)). Single unsaturation
changes have been shown to be important in various types of disease
states, including cancers55,56 and multiple sclerosis,57 and so the ability to resolve such fine mass
differences opens the door to studying the precise roles of the subtle
changes in lipid structure throughout tissues.

Figure 2 Representative images
of close mass differences in negative and
positive mode, from a single, scan. Images are total ion current normalized.
Positive mode lipid spectra have a significant number of mass differences
of 2.4 mDa (a), representing the difference between 12C2 and 23Na1H. 2.4 mDa differences are
baseline resolved, and show significantly different distributions
within brain tissue (b and c). There are nearly 200 such differences
in the averaged spectra, shown in 0.5 mDa bins (d). Similarly, negative
mode spectra have 1.79 mDa mass differences (e). These 1.79 mDa differences
are resolved to better than full-width half-maximum, differentiated
well enough to distinguish them in brain tissue (f and g). The of
1.79 mDa mass difference is relatively uncommon in negative mode,
but mass differences of 10 mDa or less occur approximately 500 times
in the averaged spectra, shown in 0.25 mDa bins (h).

Using the same experimental design in the negative-ion mode,
additional
small mass differences could be resolved. For example, a mass difference
of 0.00179 Da (1.79 mDa) at m/z 757.52 was observed
at 31 different masses. This corresponds the mass difference of C2N113C1 versus H3O3 (Figure 2e). While less common than the NaH vs C2 mass difference
in positive mode, ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and PC
lipids can have this difference from the phosphatidylglycerol (PG)
class. These peaks were thus identified as phosphatidylethanolamine
[PE(O-38:7)+13C–H]− and [PG(34:1)-H]−. This is the smallest mass difference observed in
any MSI data set to date. The PE is a 13C-containing nuclide
of the monoisotopic PE lipid at m/z 746.51300. PE and PG lipids are synthesized by different biological
pathways and have different physiological function. PE lipids are
∼20% of all phospholipids, and are especially abundant in white
matter of the cerebellum (Figure 2f).58 By contrast, PG lipids
are associated with ATP-Binding Cassette 3, though what transport
function is utilized is unknown.59 The
1.79 mDa mass difference occurred over 100 000 times in our
MSI experiment, with 33 unique pairs detected in the total mass spectrum.
As in the positive mode, the 13C2 vs H2 difference occurs regularly, and has many of the same ramifications
as discussed above.

Dynamic Range
One of the most problematic
complications
in MSI is the low relative ionization efficiency from the surface,
which combined with the wide range of analyte concentrations, places
significant demands on the single scan dynamic range achievable in
an MSI experiment. High sensitivity and dynamic range are thus necessary
to detect low abundance and/or poorly ionized species without distorting
the peak abundances obtained from high intensity signals. Figure 3a shows a single
pixel mass spectrum of the lipid m/z range from the positive-ion mode data set (scan no. 10 000),
which has a dynamic range of 536:1 (expanded mass range spectrum shown
in SI Figure 2). The dynamic range was
calculated by dividing the signal magnitude of the base peak by the
peak detection threshold of six standard deviations (6σ) above
the baseline noise. As typically observed from brain tissue, the [M+K]+ ion of PC(34:1) generated the highest signal magnitude, with
a signal-to-noise = 2370:1 (Figure 3b; side lobe artifacts are a result of the absorption
mode processing, and current work is focused on their removal). By
contrast, rat brain tissue sections prepared from the same original
organ and under the same conditions showed a signal-to-noise = 336:1
on a Thermo Orbitrap Elite set at 240 000 resolving power (@ m/z 400) at the Maastricht MultiModal Molecular
Imaging Institute (data not shown). Using a peak detection threshold
of 6σ above the baseline noise, the lowest intensity signal
was observed with a signal-to-noise = 6 and corresponded to the (PE(46:5)+13C2+H)+ (Figure 3c). SI Figure 3 shows the
isotopic distribution for PE 46:5, where the 13C2 containing nuclide can be identified at M+2. In addition, SI Figure 4 shows ppm error distributions for
the monoisotopic peak, M+1 (13C1), and M+2 (13C2) which show good mass accuracy, despite the
low S/N of the M+2 peak. Per pixel, the average dynamic range in positive
ion mode was 438:1, with a maximum dynamic range of 2090:1 and a minimum
of 60:1 (SI Figure 5). Negative-ion mode
spectra had lower signal magnitude than positive mode, limiting the
average dynamic range to 214:1, with a maximum of 849:1 and minimum
of 30:1 (SI Figure 6).

Figure 3 Single on-tissue mass
spectrum illustrates high dynamic range per
pixel. Peaks were picked at a threshold of six standard deviations
above the baseline noise. Dynamic range in a single average pixel
of at 536:1 is demonstrated here at pixel number 10 000, (a).
Mass scale expanded segment around most abundant peak [PC 34:1 + K]+ (b). Further, peak at 798.5410 generates a bright image (b).
One of the lowest S/N peaks, the 13C2 isotope
of [PE 46:5 + H]+ (c) while less clear, still yields informative
molecular images, being highlighted especially in the ventricles (images
are TIC normalized).

High Mass Accuracy
FT-ICR MSI at 21 T showed a root-mean-square
(rms) mass measurement accuracy of 62.12 ppb (Figure 4a), over 2-fold lower rms mass accuracy achieved
on a 9 T instrument, which was limited to an rms of 158 ppb.60 The center of the distribution is centered near
zero, and the low standard deviation indicates low m/z fluctuation during the imaging experiment. SI Figure 7 shows the measured m/z variation for [PC(36:1)+H]+ (m/z = 788.61638, dotted red line indicates
the exact m/z) over the imaging
experiment, where the maximum m/z deviation is 0.00018, with a standard deviation of 0.00078. Internal
calibration was performed using seven tentatively identified lipid
masses ([PC(34:1)+K]+, [SM(34:1;2)+H]+, [PE(36:4)+13C+H]+, [PC(32:0)+Na]+, [PC(34:1)+H]+, [PC(38:4)+Na]+, and [PC(38:4)+K]+).
After this internal calibration, all scans were summed (in the mass
domain), which generated an initial peak list of 2,643 above the 6σ
noise limit. This list was then submitted to ALEX123 for identification.
We tentatively identify 702 monoistopic lipid peaks in positive-ion
mode, which all have mass accuracy values of ±150 ppb (Figure 4b). These 702 lipid
peaks correspond to 388 unique lipid IDs, after accounting for three
possible cations types, which accounts for 26.9% of the initial peak
list. SI Table 1 contains a full list of
these lipids. An additional 1400 spectral peaks are as isotopologues
(typically 13C and 13C2) of the 702
lipids, which accounts for ∼80% of all peaks. Negative ion
mode yielded similar results, where 662 potential monoisotopic lipid
peaks (34%) were identified out of an initial peak list of 1927. Due
to the lower S/N of the negative
mode spectra, only 738 further peaks were identified as isotopes,
for a total of ∼72.6% of all peaks identified.

Figure 4 Error histogram and average
mass error of tentatively identified
lipids after internal calibration. Measured mass error histogram of
139 phosphatidylcholine lipids; the rms error is 61.12 ppb. Bin size
= 10 ppb. (a), Lipid identifications by class. A tolerance of ±250
ppb results in 702 potential lipids identified within 150 ppb of their
expected mass (b).

These lipid IDs are supported
both by the high mass accuracy (<150
ppb, most <100 ppb) and in the positive mode by the intensity of
multiple cations for the same species, relative to one another (Figure 5a). As protonation,
sodiation, and potassiation are all potentially available in brain
MSI, we examined the potential to confirm our lipid identifications
by comparing all three cations. For the most abundant lipid (PC(34:1)),
the [M+K] ion has an average ppb error of 16.7, [M + Na] −43.5,
and [M + H] 2.2. While these mass errors are low enough individually
to be highly confident in their assignment, having all three ions
within 60 ppb of one another provides another layer of certainty.
Additionally, we can examine the normalized peak intensities of all
three ions to one another, in this case showing 100%, 47.9%, and 21.4%,
simplified to a ratio of 4.7:2.2:1. While this insight is not necessarily
informative on its own, we can compare this ratio to other PCs, with
all the PCs above 3% of the base peak showing the same ratio (Figure 5a). Further, PCs
that vary in relative intensity down to 0.2% of the base peak have
generally similar ratios to PC(34:1), although as the intensities
begin to approach the 6σ limit, the ratios begin to deviate
and be less similar (Figure 5b). One likely scenario for this discrepancy at low S/N is that as peaks for any given scan
drop below the 6σ threshold, the least abundant ions are ignored,
leading to sum signal magnitudes in the averaged spectrum that are
slightly erroneous. However, as the relative ratios of the three cations
are invariable across three orders of magnitude, it improves our certainty
that each identification is correct for all lipids within that class.
While we observe no alterations to this ratio in the abundant lipid
classes, theoretically alterations to this standard ratio could indicate
greater abundance of a given lipid within different brain structures
(i.e., within the ventricle space rather than within gray or white
matter). It is worthwhile to further explore the potentials here,
and whether there are observable changes to this ratio between other
brain tissues. Additionally, we observe that other lipid classes show
similar, though slightly different ratios (SI Figure 8), potentially related to the changes in brain tissue.
Negative ionization does not typically have multiple ions of the same
species (with deprotonation being the only common method of generating
lipid anions unless dopants are added61,62); however,
between the most abundant phosphatidylserine (PS(40:6)) and the least
abundant (PS(34:4)) there is only a change in ppb error of 17.3 despite
a change in intensity of more than an order of magnitude (Figure 5c).

Figure 5 Relative abundance of
identified lipids by cation and anion for
selected classes. In the positive mode, the three major cations (proton,
sodium, and potassium) are aligned next to one another, showing the
same relative percentages between species, from the most abundant
species (PC 34:1) and the other PCs above 3% (a), as well as for the
lower abundant species down to the least abundant species with all
three cations represented, PC 44:12 (b). The relative ionization rate
between K+, H+, and Na+ hold strictly
true down to 1.5%, and generally true down to 0.05%. While the dynamic
range is lower for negative mode, we see many potential identifications
for many lipid classes (c). We further observe a similar ability to
identify potential lipids as low as 0.15% of the most abundant peak
(PI 38:4), for a range of nearly three orders of magnitude from the
summed spectra (d).

Conclusion
We
have demonstrated the utility of combining MSI workflows with
a 21 T FT-ICR mass spectrometer. The high magnetic field, combined
with a state-of-the-art ICR cell design provides ultrahigh mass resolving
power, ppb mass measurement accuracy, and high sensitivity for molecular
imaging studies. This advanced instrumentation will pave the way for
better understanding of the molecular structure of many tissue types,
as well as clarifying current ambiguities in MSI. The unique capabilities
of this instrument have not yet been fully utilized: online tandem
mass spectrometry is possible via collision induced dissociation in
the linear ion trap, or in the ICR cell via infrared multiphoton dissociation
or ultraviolet photo dissociation. Further, the use of harmonic detection
cells would further increase the speed of acquisition in these experiments
or allow for even higher mass resolving power in a similar time frame.
Combined with data-driven MSI acquisition techniques (such as Data-Dependent
Acquisition), this instrument promises the most information per unit
time of any MSI platform. The estimated number of charges sent to
the ICR cell in these experiments is ∼4 × 105, based on the mass spectral calibration parameters. The 21T FT-ICR
routinely operates with ion targets of 1–3 × 106, so additional improvement in dynamic range per pixel is expected.
Further, we aim to leverage the unique capabilities of this instrument
for other biomolecule imaging experiments, such as metabolites, tryptic
peptides, and intact proteins.. This instrument will provide valuable
insight into the molecular complexity of tissues at an unprecedented
mass spectral resolution, allowing for greater insight into the true
distribution of all molecules, as well as accelerating the identification
of subtle changes hidden within tissues.
