Direct
analysis of synthetic fibers under ambient conditions is
highly desired to identify the polymer, the finishes applied and irregularities
that may compromise its performance and value. In this paper, laser
ablation electrospray ionization ion mobility time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (LAESI-IMS-TOF-MS) was used for the analysis of synthetic
polymers and fibers. The key to this analysis was the absorption of
laser light by aliphatic and aromatic nitrogen functionalities in
the polymers. Analysis of polyamide (PA) 6, 46, 66, and 12 pellets
and PA 6, 66, polyaramid and M5 fibers yielded characteristic fragment
ions without any sample pretreatment, enabling their unambiguous identification.
Synthetic fibers are, in addition, commonly covered with a surface
layer for improved adhesion and processing. The same setup, but operated
in a transient infrared matrix-assisted laser desorption electrospray
ionization (IR-MALDESI) mode, allowed the detailed characterization
of the fiber finish layer and the underlying polymer. Differences
in finish layer distribution may cause variations in local properties
of synthetic fibers. Here we also show the feasibility of mass spectrometry
imaging (MSI) of the distribution of a finish layer on the synthetic
fiber and the successful detection of local surface defects.

==== Body
Synthetic
fibers such as polyamide
and polyester are widely used in many industrial materials, fabrics,
clothes, etc., and their importance can hardly be overemphasized.
High-performance fibers such as polyaramid are heat resistant and
stronger than steel on an equal weight basis. Because of these properties,
they can be used in, for example, ballistic vests, cables, optical
fiber reinforcement, as well as in rubber reinforcement such as in
tires, high-pressure hoses, conveyer belts, etc. The properties of
synthetic fibers and their interaction with surrounding materials
are strongly influenced by the chemical treatment of their surface.1−4 A large number of different types of surface layers can be used
to adapt the fiber properties to the desired applications. Surface
layers are used for processing, e.g., to reduce friction, electrostatic
charging, and abrasion5 or to allow better
adhesion to other polymers in blends.6−8 Differences in the amount
and distribution of the surface layer lead to variations in properties
of the fiber.9 Such surface defects might
result in weak spots leading to abrasion or localized reduced adhesion,10 which could be detrimental in high-performance
applications.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is an excellent tool for
the characterization
of polymers as well as polymer surfaces and additives. The use of
MS in polymer analysis has been reviewed recently.11,12 Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is commonly used for the
analysis of polymers and synthetic fibers.13−26 SIMS typically produces small fragment ions for solid polymer samples,
e.g., CN– in PA fibers.18,20,21 Oligomers of PA of 6 up to 24 repeating
units were observed after dissolution of the fiber in trifluoroacetic
acid, deposition on a silver substrate, and SIMS analysis.13 Also, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
MS (MALDI-MS) is frequently used for the characterization of polymers.27−33 Applications range from mass spectrometry imaging of polymer membranes,
showing polymer distributions and contaminations on membrane surfaces,32 to the characterization of branching in polyaramid
fibers.33 The analysis of fibers by SIMS
or MALDI-MS is, however, hampered by sample pretreatment requirements
and ionization under vacuum conditions. Analysis under ambient conditions
without any sample pretreatment would be very useful for synthetic
fibers in order to quickly identify the material, finish layers, and
defects without introducing any pretreatment-induced bias.

Direct
analysis in real time (DART) is an ambient MS technique
first introduced in 2005 by Cody.34 DART
has been used for the detection of additives in different polymer
materials such as softeners and stabilizers or degradation products,35−40 but the polymer material itself was not detected since DART relies
on thermal desorption. Some progress has been made to fingerprint
insoluble polymers under ambient conditions using thermal-assisted
atmospheric pressure glow discharge (TA-APGD) following fixation of
the sample on a heated stage.41 Other plasma-based
techniques such as plasma-assisted desorption ionization (PADI) and
flowing afterglow atmospheric pressure glow discharge (FA-APGD) were
reported to successfully identify different insoluble polymers.42,43 While certainly useful, the main drawbacks of these techniques relate
to long stabilization times and relatively low spatial resolution
that precludes mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) of fibers. Another
ambient ionization MS technique used for identification of polymer
species is desorption electrospray ionization (DESI).44−47 DESI relies on the solubility of sample material for desorption
and subsequent ESI-like ionization mechanisms.48 For the analysis of hydrophobic polymers, such as poly(methyl
methacrylate) and polymethylstyrene, methanol solutions containing
formic acid or salts such as lithium bromide or silver nitrate were
used.49 Without water in the solution,
however, DESI is less able to create higher charge states which limits
polymer analysis applications.

Alternatively, laser-based techniques
are fast and offer much smaller
spot sizes. Electrospray-assisted laser desorption ionization (ELDI)
was used to characterize dried polymer standard solutions of PPG 1000,
PMMA 1300, and PEG 1500 on the surface of a steel sample plate.50 Tuning of the laser wavelength to specific polymer
absorption bands removed the necessity of an external matrix and allowed
successful ablation of bulk polymer material, as demonstrated with
a free electron laser operated at a wavelength of 3.43 μm to
interact with the aliphatic CH stretch vibration of polystyrene.51 Ablated material can subsequently be postionized
by different techniques such as electrospray ionization, chemical
ionization, or photoionization.52−54

Laser ablation electrospray
ionization (LAESI) is an ambient (imaging)
MS technique first introduced by Nemes and Vertes in 2007.52 It uses a mid-infrared laser producing a wavelength
of 2.94 μm that addresses hydroxyl functionalities, such as
endogenous water molecules in biomaterials. In principle, the same
wavelength can also be absorbed by aliphatic or aromatic nitrogen
functionalities in polymers. The absorbed energy could break the polymer
chains and ablate characteristic fragments under ambient conditions
for subsequent mass spectrometric analysis. In the absence of laser-absorbing
functional groups, a small amount of water vapor can be condensed
on a sample surface to absorb the laser energy, as was shown for the
detailed structure elucidation of dyes on fabrics by infrared matrix-assisted
laser desorption electrospray ionization (IR-MALDESI).55 Detailed characterization along the length of
a 1 mm wide synthetic fiber was feasible. IR-MALDESI-MSI of dyes on
textile fibers within a forensic context even showed single filament
images as small as 10 μm in diameter.56 When combining MSI with ion mobility separation (IMS), an additional
separation dimension becomes available to identify different polymer
distributions and to separate ions with the same mass to charge (m/z) ratio but having different collisional
cross sections.57

In this research,
we demonstrate the detailed MS characterization
of different synthetic fibers such as PA 6, 46, 66, 12, polyaramid,
and M5 by direct LAESI-MS. In addition, we provide full finish characterization,
show the feasibility of mass spectrometry imaging of the fiber, the
distribution of the finish layer, and the detection of local surface
defects by LAESI-IMS-TOF-MSI operated in a transient (ice) matrix-assisted
laser ablation mode.

Experimental Section
Materials
Ultrapure
water (H2O) 18.2 MΩ
cm at 25 °C was freshly produced daily with a Millipore (Molsheim,
France) integral 3 system. Methanol (MeOH) LC–MS grade was
purchased from VWR (Leuven, Belgium). Formic acid (FA) LC–MS
grade was bought from Fisher Scientific (Geel, Belgium). Leucine-enkephalin
(leu-enk) for lock mass-corrected mass calibration was purchased from
Waters (Manchester, U.K.). Para-aramid trimer-NH2 (structure
is show in Figure S1) and Twaron para-aramid
yarn were provided by Teijin Aramid (Arnhem, The Netherlands). One
standard yarn type (1680 dtex, f1000) was produced without applying
a basic spin finish. In a second step, the “naked” yarn
was treated with a finish, consisting of an aqueous solution (4.25%)
of Lansurf OA10 (polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400 monooleate, structure
is shown in Figure S2), from Lankem (Dukinfield,
United Kingdom). After application of this finish using a slit applicator,
the yarn was dried by passing through a hot air oven (3.6 s at 180
°C). The estimated (final) finish amount was 0.5% Lansurf OA10
(finish weight on yarn weight). Poly[2,6-diimidazo (4,5-β-4′,5′-ε)pyridinylene-1,4-(2,5-dihydroxy)phenylene]
(M5) fiber, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fiber, and the PA fibers
PA 6 (Mw unknown), PA 66 (Mw 27 × 103), PA 66 (Mw 46 × 103), and PA 66 (Mw 33 × 103) were from laboratory stock,
as were poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) (Mw unknown) pellets and the PA pellets PA 6 (Mw 30 × 103), PA 6 (Mw 31 × 103), PA 6 (Mw 15
× 103), PA 12 (Mw unknown),
PA 66 (Mw 22 × 103), and
PA 46 (Mw unknown). Chemical structures
of fibers and pellets are given in Figure 1.

LAESI-MS of Polymers and Fibers
A Protea Biosciences
(Morgantown, WV) LAESI DP-1000 system was coupled to a Waters (Manchester,
U.K.) Synapt G2S traveling wave ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometer
and used for the analysis of all sample materials. Both polymer pellets
and synthetic fibers were directly mounted with Tesa double-sided
tape (Hamburg, Germany) to the sample stage that was kept at 10 °C.
LAESI desktop software v.2.0.1.3 (Protea Biosciences) was used to
control experimental parameters of the LAESI system. The Nd:YAG optical
parametric oscillator mid infrared laser (2.94 μm) was set to
100% laser power (Φ 3.2 J/cm2) and 10 pulses with
a specified pulse length of 5 ns were acquired on every spot (diameter
200 μm) at a frequency of 10 Hz with a between spot interval
of 200 μm. A solution of MeOH–H2O (1:1) with
0.1% FA and 40 ng/mL leu-enk was used as electrospray solvent at a
flow rate of 1 μL/min. Electrospray voltage was set at ∼3.5
kV in order to have a stable Taylor cone. Nitrogen was used as LAESI
bath gas at 20 L/h. The Synapt G2S was controlled by Masslynx v4.1
SCN 883 (Waters) and operated in positive ion TOF-MS resolution mode, m/z range 50–1200 Da, scan time
1 s, and source and interface temperatures were both set at 150 °C.
For ion mobility TOF-MS the IMS wave velocity was set to 650 m/s and
the transfer velocity at 1200 m/s. Background-subtracted mass spectra
were created using the “combine spectrum” function in
Masslynx: five scans, each corresponding to 10 laser pulses were averaged,
and 50 scans of the electrospray background were subtracted. Proteaplot
v2.0.8.5 (Protea Biosciences) was used to create maximum intensity
ion maps. Driftscope v2.7 (Waters) was used to select the different
polymer distributions within the m/z versus drift time space and to clean the spectral background.

IR-MALDESI and LAESI Mass Spectrometry Imaging of Fibers with
a Finish Layer
For MSI of the finish layers on the fibers,
the same instrument and experimental conditions were used as described
in the previous section, with the exception of the sample stage temperature
which was set to −19 °C, starting 15 min before analysis
in order to achieve a thin layer of ice on the sample. Consequently,
instead of LAESI, ice-assisted LAESI or IR-MALDESI55,56 occurred for typically the first two or three (out of ten) laser
pulses applied. Optical images of the 10 cm × 7 cm sample stage
were obtained and used to superimpose the ion maps. A 60 × 6
pattern (350 sample locations) with an interval of 400 μm was
acquired around the synthetic fiber area on the optical image. The
MSI analysis, including the recording of electrospray background,
had a total runtime of 45 min.

Results and Discussion
LAESI
Fingerprinting of Synthetic Polymers
LAESI experiments
conventionally use a mid-infrared laser (2.94 μm) to efficiently
transfer laser energy to the strong OH stretch vibration of water-containing
(mostly biological) samples in order to ablate sample material prior
to ionization by electrospray for subsequent MS analysis. Besides
the strong OH absorption band, also NH stretch vibrations of amines
and amides absorb at this wavelength. So initially, we examined LAESI-TOF-MS
as a tool for rapid ambient identification of solid NH-containing
polymer materials without any sample pretreatment. Figure 2 presents the background-subtracted
mass spectra of different polyamides. The mass spectra obtained show
characteristic ions and confirm the capability of LAESI fingerprinting
of polyamides. The mass accuracies corresponding to the proposed elemental
compositions are provided in Table S1.
The mass spectrum of PA 6 (Figure 2A) shows a high abundance ion at m/z 114.091 having the elemental composition [C6H12NO]+, which represents residual caprolactam
monomer and ions formed by cleavage of the amide bond. This high abundance
ion differentiates PA 6 from the other polyamides and was also observed
by Klun after acid hydrolysis of PA 6 and subsequent electrospray
MS analysis.58 In LAESI analysis, although
at lower intensity, m/z values 128.105
[C7H14NO]+, 142.121 [C8H16NO]+, 156.138 [C9H18NO]+, 170.153 [C10H20NO]+, and 184.168 [C11H22NO]+ were additionally
detected. Two extra PA 6 samples were analyzed providing similar results,
the background-subtracted mass spectra are presented in Figures S3 and S4. The LAESI mass spectrum of
PA 12 (Figure 2B) shows
a single ion at m/z 198.188 having
the elemental composition of [C12H24NO]+. Like PA 6, this ion represents residual monomer and/or cleavage
of the amide bond yielding the ion for the repeating unit of PA 12.
In contrast to PA 6 and 12, PA 46 and PA 66 are synthesized from two
different monomers; therefore, their mass spectra will be more complex.
Cleavage of the amide bond will lead to fragments containing at least
either two nitrogen atoms or two oxygen atoms, and furthermore cleavage
of carbon–carbon bonds could yield fragments that contain the
intact amide bond. The LAESI mass spectrum of PA 46 is presented in Figure 2C and shows ions
at m/z values 128.105 [C7H14NO]+, 142.126 [C8H16NO]+, and 156.138 [C9H18NO]+ that are consistent with the intact amide bond and carbon–carbon
bond cleavages at different positions of the polymer backbone. In
addition, the ion at m/z 115.089
[C5H11N2O]+ is formed,
which is characteristic for polyamides containing 1,4-butanediamine,
like PA 46. This fragment contains the amide group, the four carbon
atoms, and the final nitrogen yielding an elemental composition unique
for PA 46. Finally, the mass spectrum of PA 66 is depicted in Figure 2D. Like PA 46 this
spectrum contains ions at m/z values
128.105 [C7H14NO]+, 142.121 [C8H16NO]+, and 156.138 [C9H18NO]+. However, in PA 66 this ion series continues
with the m/z values 170.153 [C10H20NO]+ and 184.168 [C11H22NO]+ that could not be found in PA 46. In
addition, the absence of m/z values
115.089 (PA 46), 198.188 (PA 12), and high intensity m/z 114.091 (PA 6) makes this spectrum unique for
identification of PA 66 polymer. It should be noted that MS/MS data
acquisition following precursor ion selection of specific LAESI induced
fragment ions may add additional evidence for the identity of the
polymers but was not further investigated here.

mass spectra of polyamide pellets

In the MS analysis of polyamides with other ionization techniques
like SIMS, MALDI and sequential pyrolysis field desorption, PA distributions
of multiple intact oligomers have been detected.13,59−61 Differentiation between, e.g., PA 6 and PA 66 could
not be achieved. With FA-APGD, the cyclic monomer ion of PA 66 at m/z 227 could be detected.43 In LAESI, we detect characteristic polymer fragments in
the low mass range. This is in contrast with the suggestion that LAESI
is a low energy ionization technique comparable to ESI.52 Note that in the present situation the NH stretching
vibration within the amide bond is addressed in the absence of water
and, as a result, the laser energy is not dissipated by an excess
of hydroxyl moieties from the sample matrix.

LAESI Fingerprinting of
Synthetic Fibers
Similarly,
LAESI-MS can be used to identify the polymer used in synthetic fibers.
Different NH-containing fibers, such as the polyamides PA 6 and PA
66 and the aromatic fibers polyaramid and M5, were analyzed by LAESI-TOF-MS.
Additionally, the obtained data were used to generate spatial ion
maps superimposed onto the camera images of the fibers in order to
explore LAESI-MSI possibilities. Figure 3 shows ion maps and background-subtracted
mass spectra of (A) PA 6, (B) PA 66, (C) polyaramid, and (D) M5 fibers.
The LAESI mass spectrum of PA 6 (Figure 3A) shows the same fragment ion at m/z 114.091 as obtained with the pellets,
and a range of ions formed by breaking of carbon–carbon bonds
in the polymer backbone. Most likely, PA 6 fiber contains less residual
caprolactam monomer than the PA 6 polymer sample analyzed in Figure 2A. The additional
ions in Figure 3A were
also observed (but at much lower relative intensity) in the LAESI
mass spectrum of the PA 6 polymer sample shown in Figure 2A. The LAESI mass spectra obtained
from PA 66 fibers (Figure 3B and Figures S5 and S6) show similar
fragment ions as seen for the PA 66 pellets in Figure 2D, strengthening our claim on the identification
of PA polymers, regardless of processing into fibers or as raw polymer
materials. The LAESI mass spectrum of the aromatic polyaramid fiber
shows characteristic fragment ions at m/z 107.059 and m/z 135.057, which
belong to the elemental compositions [C6H7N2]+ and [C7H7N2O]+, respectively. These fragments originate from the
aromatic ring containing the two (1,4-) amine groups [C6H7N2]+ and one additional carbonyl
group from the amide [C7H7N2O]+. The second aromatic fiber analyzed, M5, does not contain
an amide bond (cf. Figure 1); nevertheless, the laser energy could be absorbed by either
or both the secondary amine and hydroxyl groups. The background-subtracted
LAESI mass spectrum of M5 given in Figure 3D shows fragment ions at m/z 120.058, m/z 143.059, and m/z 144.053. The
elemental compositions of these fragments are [C6H6N3]+, [C9H7N2]+, and [C8H6N3]+, respectively. Although these elemental compositions
are difficult to explain and require multiple bond cleavages, these
ions are unique for M5 among the NH-containing fibers such as polyamides
and polyaramides. Therefore, these ions provide the ability to quickly
identify this fiber under ambient conditions. In comparison with,
and in contrast to other ionization techniques like pyrolysis MS,62 MALDI and IR-MALDESI,33,55,56 LAESI exclusively provides fragments in
the low mass range. In SIMS, oxygen containing fragment ions from
PA 6 filaments with m/z values 31,
45, 114, and 227 were detected in positive ion mode by Yip et al.20 In comparison, the fragment ions m/z 31 and 45 were outside the mass range of our
mass spectrometer, but m/z value
114 corresponds to the mass found in this study for the repeating
unit fragment of PA 6.

Figure 3 LAESI background-subtracted mass spectra and ion maps
of (A) PA
6 fiber, (B) PA 66 fiber, (C) polyaramid fiber, and (D) M5 fiber.
Ion maps show the highest intensity ion: (A) m/z 114.091, (B) m/z 156.138,
(C) m/z 135.057, and (D) m/z 143.059.

In addition to straightforward polymer identification, the
feasibility
of LAESI-MSI was explored in the same experiments. Reconstructed ion
maps, superimposed on the optical images, show the distribution of
the most abundant fragment ion in Figure 3A–D. In all cases the ion follows
nicely the 1 mm wide fiber pattern on the sample stage. At 200 μm
spatial resolution, approximately five locations were analyzed over
the fiber diameter. These results are very encouraging for imaging
of finish layers on fibers.

LAESI Induced Fragmentation of Polymers
In order to
support our hypothesis that laser-induced fragmentation, initiated
by absorption at NH functionalities, is the primary cause of the observed
polymer characteristic fragment ions, we performed a range of complementary
experiments. First, we extracted polyaramid fiber with MeOH (as described
in the Supporting Information) to find
out whether unreacted monomers, dimer, trimer, etc. could be present
and contribute to the observed characteristic ions. The obtained ESI-MS
background subtracted mass spectrum is depicted in Figure S7. Evidently, the finish is detected, but the fiber
polymer fragments at m/z 107.059
and 135.057 (or dimers/trimers) were not.

To investigate the
possibility of acid hydrolysis due to the close proximity of the formic
acid-containing electrospray plume, we placed 10 cm of polyaramid
fiber into 4 mL of electrospray solution for 30 min. Subsequently,
we analyzed this solution by ESI-MS and, as expected, did not detect
any of the characteristic polymer fragments (data not shown). It should
be kept in mind however that the pH experienced in electrospray droplets
may be lower (due to charging and concentration effects of the spray)
than that of the bulk spray solution.

In addition to the analysis
of polyaramid material with LAESI in
the absence of water, aramid trimer-NH2 was also investigated. Figure S8A presents the ESI background subtracted
mass spectrum of a 1 μg/mL trimer-NH2 solution in
MeOH–H2O (1:1) + 0.1% FA, showing ions at m/z 347.149 [M + H]+, 369.126
[M + Na]+, and 174.080 [M + 2H]2+. Also, the
LAESI background subtracted mass spectrum of a 10 μg/mL trimer-NH2 solution in MeOH–H2O (1:1) is depicted
(Figure S8B), showing a single ion at m/z 347.149 [M + H]+. In contrast,
LAESI analysis of trimer-NH2 powder (mass spectrum is shown
in Figure S8C) did not display any of these
masses, just the fragment ions m/z 107.059 and 135.057, as with the LAESI analysis of polyaramid fiber.
This demonstrates that the observed fragmentation of the solid polymer
pellets and fibers is a result of the dissipation of the laser energy.
To examine the importance of absorption by NH functionalities within
the polymer material, two materials without the NH functionality were
measured: PMMA pellets and PET fiber. In accordance with our hypothesis,
no ions from these polymers were detected (data not shown).

To further explore the effect of laser energy on the fragmentation
of the polymer materials, PA 66 pellets were analyzed at different
amounts of laser energy: 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100%. Only at 100% laser
power fragment ions, e.g., m/z 142.121
and 156.138 were detected. Most likely, this is a result of the laser
ablation threshold, as is reported for IR laser ablation of other
polymeric materials in the literature.51,63 Kappes et
al. proposed an ablation mechanism well below decomposition temperature
that is photomechanical, i.e., a stress due to the thermal expansion
of the polymer.63 Here we hypothesize that
in case the laser energy cannot be dissipated by the solvent (or endogenous
water), the NH-functionalities in the solid material will absorb the
energy. As the stretch vibrations are unable to dissipate the excess
of energy, multiple bond cleavages in the polymer backbone will occur,
resulting in ablated polymer fragments.

IR-MALDESI and LAESI MSI
of Polyaramid Fiber with Finish
A PEG 400 monooleate finish
was applied to polyaramid fiber at a
fiber treatment line as described in the Experimental
Section. Investigations of the fiber containing this finish
layer were conducted with transient IR-MALDESI and LAESI IMS-TOF-MSI
in a single setup. The background-subtracted mass spectrum of polyaramid
fiber containing 0.5% (m/m) finish is presented in Figure S9A and shows several polymer distributions. The characterization
of this finish was supported by extracting the different polymer distributions
from the m/z versus ion mobility
map provided in Figure 4. Three main distributions were assigned: (1) a [(PEG)n + NH4]+ distribution (Figure S9B), (2) a [(PEG)n monooleate + NH4]+ distribution (Figure S9C), and (3) a [(PEG)n dioleate + NH4]+ distribution (Figure S9D). In addition to these polymer distributions, m/z 283.264 and m/z 309.282 are present, which are tentatively assigned to
protonated oleic acid and an elimination product of the PEG ester
of oleic acid (structure is shown in Figure S10), respectively. These results directly obtained from a fiber surface
are, apart from the different cations and lower intensities, in excellent
agreement with the LAESI data obtained from a 1% solution of the finish
in MeOH (Figure S11A–F). In the
latter, [M + Na]+ ions dominated over [M + NH4]+ ions. In other words, the transient ice-assisted LAESI
provided the same low-energy ablation of the finish polymers from
the surface as from solution. Similar cationized ethylene glycol oligomers
were also found in the analysis of PEG 3000 with DESI;45 however, in our study no multiple charged polymers
were observed due to a lower degree of PEG polymerization.

Figure 4 IR-MALDESI-IMS m/z versus ion
mobility map of 0.5% (m/m) PEG 400 monooleate applied as described
in the Experimental Section on polyaramid
fiber. Mass spectra of selected areas are shown for 1 in Figure S9B, for 2 in Figure S9C, and for 3 in Figure S9D.

The distribution of the finish
layer along the fiber and thus any
surface defects, i.e., the areas without finish, could be visualized
by reconstructing ion maps of the finish ions. An artificial defect
of approximately 5 mm along the fiber length was produced by local
heating of the fiber with 0.5% finish for 3 s with a soldering iron.
Characteristic ions from both the fiber and the finish ion, e.g.,
[(PEG)10 monooleate + NH4]+ were
superimposed on the optical image to create the ion maps, depicted
in Figure 5. These
ion maps show the polyaramid fiber (Figure 5A) and the finish layer (Figure 5B) with surface defects, demonstrating
the ability of ambient imaging to investigate finish layers and the
detection of defects in finish layers by transient IR-MALDESI and
LAESI-IMS-TOF-MSI in a single experiment.

[(PEG)10 monooleate + NH4]+ (m/z 740.551 ± 0.001).

Conclusion
This study investigated
polymer fingerprinting, finish characterization,
and the detection of surface defects by mass spectrometry imaging
(MSI) under ambient conditions without any sample pretreatment. It
was shown that the laser at a wavelength of 2.94 μm ablates
solid polymer material containing aliphatic and aromatic nitrogen
groups, providing fragments to successfully identify PA 6, PA 46,
PA 66, PA 12, polyaramid, and M5 polymer species. It was also shown
that the finish layer could be fully characterized and, by MSI, localized,
which provides detailed insight into surface defects and thus weak
spots in the material. Further research might explore possibilities
of other laser wavelengths, such as 3.43 μm light to interact
with the aliphatic CH stretch vibration to broaden the polymer application
range.
