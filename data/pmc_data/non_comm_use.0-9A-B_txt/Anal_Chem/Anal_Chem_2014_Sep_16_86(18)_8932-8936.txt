Recombinant therapeutic monoclonal
antibodies exhibit a high degree
of heterogeneity that can arise from various post-translational modifications.
The formulation for a protein product is to maintain a specific pH
and to minimize further modifications. Generally Recognized as Safe
(GRAS), citric acid is commonly used for formulation to maintain a
pH at a range between 3 and 6 and is generally considered chemically
inert. However, as we reported herein, citric acid covalently modified
a recombinant monoclonal antibody (IgG1) in a phosphate/citrate-buffered
formulation at pH 5.2 and led to the formation of so-called “acidic
species” that showed mass increases of 174 and 156 Da, respectively.
Peptide mapping revealed that the modification occurred at the N-terminus
of the light chain. Three additional antibodies also showed the same
modification but displayed different susceptibilities of the N-termini
of the light chain, heavy chain, or both. Thus, ostensibly unreactive
excipients under certain conditions may increase heterogeneity and
acidic species in formulated recombinant monoclonal antibodies. By
analogy, other molecules (e.g., succinic acid) with two or more carboxylic
acid groups and capable of forming an anhydride may exhibit similar
reactivities. Altogether, our findings again reminded us that it is
prudent to consider formulations as a potential source for chemical
modifications and product heterogeneity.

==== Body
As most protein
pharmaceuticals,
recombinant monoclonal antibodies have a higher degree of inherent
complexity as compared to traditional small molecule drugs. Various
protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) have been well documented
as major contributors to heterogeneity observed in recombinant monoclonal
antibodies.1−6 Some of these processes occur during cell culture, such as modifications
by reactive metabolites (e.g., methylglyoxal and homocysteine thiolactone),7,8 glycosylation and sialic acid incorporation,9−17 while others can occur through production, purification, and storage,
such as oxidation,18−21 deamidation,22−27 cross-linking,28,29 protein–protein interactions,30 and fragmentation.31−34

An important part of drug
development is to optimize formulation
for a given biotherapeutic.35,36 The formulation should
minimize unwanted modifications or degradation during storage.3,37 For example, polysorbate80 may be added to mitigate aggregation.38−41 Free methionine may reduce the formation of methionine sulfoxide
in proteins.42−45 A critical aspect of formulation is the control of pH. One major
reason is to minimize the deamidation of asparagine, a spontaneous
nonenzymatic process that occurs in all monoclonal antibodies and
the vast majority of protein pharmaceuticals.16,22,24−26,46,47 Specifically, mildly acidic pH
has been shown to reduce deamidation of asparagine.22−27

While almost all excipients added to the biotherapeutic formulation
are Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) and considered chemically
inert (i.e., free from reactions with the protein products), they
may nonetheless display unexpected reactivities. For example, autoxidation
of polysorbate 80 generated radicals that in turn increased the oxidative
liabilities of the formulation, e.g., increases in methionine sulfoxide.48 Photo-oxidation also induces cleavage, cross-linking,
and aggregation.13,29,34,49,50 Glycation
has been reported when glucose (a reducing sugar with a hemiacetal
or aldehyde group) was added to a lyophilized protein drug.51 As a result of this finding, sucrose (devoid
of hemiacetal or aldehyde group) was used instead to reduce aggregation.52 Yet, in other studies, the glycosidic bond of
nonreducing sucrose was shown to hydrolyze into glucose and fructose,
resulting in glycation during storage.53,54 Pertinent
to this work, photochemical degradation of citric acid led to acetonation
of therapeutic proteins.55 Therefore, it
is important to thoroughly evaluate the protein drug integrity following
storage in the defined formulation and to screen for unexpected reactivity
and modifications.

As reported herein, we observed an early
eluting peak (i.e., acidic
species) in the weak cation exchange (WCX) chromatogram for an antibody
in citric acid formulation. Peptide mapping and mass spectrometric
analysis revealed that covalent modifications by citric acid led to
the formation of amides (mass increase of 174 Da) and/or imides (mass
increase of 156 Da) at the N-terminus of the light chain.56 Furthermore, three additional recombinant monoclonal
antibodies displayed a similar susceptibility of the N-termini of
both the light and heavy chains. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first report of a citric acid modification of recombinant monoclonal
antibodies. By analogy, other molecules (e.g., succinic acid) with
two or more carboxylic acid groups and capable of forming an anhydride
may exhibit similar reactivities.57,58 Altogether,
our findings again remind us that it is prudent to carefully consider
formulation excipients as a potential source for chemical modifications.

Results and Discussion
As detailed below, we found that
citric acid covalently modified
the N-termini of either or both the light and heavy chains in four
different antibodies. Our analysis and results are consistent with
the mechanism depicted in Scheme 1 with the
anhydrides of citric acid as key intermediates.

Scheme 1 (I) Formation of
a Citric Acid Anhydride Intermediate from Citric
Acid and the Subsequent Reaction of the N-Terminal Amine with the
Anhydride and (II) Four Possible Products of the Reaction
+174A and +174B represent
adducts formed between the N-terminal amine and the citric acid anhydride.
The +156A and +156B represent the subsequent imide products (5 and
6-membered rings, respectively) resulting from the cyclization of
the newly formed amide and another carboxylic acid in citric acid.
There are three carboxylic acids in citric acid: two are equivalent
as denoted by the red dots and the other by the blue dot.

Unexpected Covalent Modifications by Citric Acid
A
recombinant monoclonal antibody (Antibody A) was stored at 40 °C
for 6 months in two different formulations to determine if there were
any major differences in the protein stability. One formulation had
1 mM sodium citrate, 6.5 mM citric acid and the other formulation
was without sodium citrate/citric acid; both had mannitol and polysorbate
80 and were at pH 5.2. Analysis of the samples by weak cation exchange
(WCX) chromatography revealed that significant degradation and accumulation
of multiple acidic species in both samples (see Figure 1). Most noticeably, the citrate formulation induced a very
early eluting and well-defined peak (peak A in Figure 1) that was absent in the other sample. This finding prompted
us to perform subsequent analysis in order to determine the nature
of these species.

Figure 1 Weak cation exchange chromatogram of the recombinant monoclonal
antibody formulated with and without citrate. The top trace shows
an early eluting acidic peak (Peak A) which is significantly smaller
in the formulation without citrate. The control represents Antibody
A in the citrate formulation stored at 4 °C.

Reduced LC/MS Analysis
Peak A fractions were examined
by reduced LC/MS (see Figure S-1 in the Supporting
Information). The major peak (observed mass 23 408 Da)
corresponded to the native light chain (theoretical mass 23 408
Da). Two other masses of 23 564 and 23 582 were observed,
increases of 156 and 174 Da, respectively. Pertinent to the mechanism
of formation discussed later, these two masses differ by 18 Da and
are likely due to the loss of a water molecule. In addition, a mass
of 23 570 Da was determined to be a glycation product (+162
Da).

Peptide Mapping and Determination of Sites of Modifications
in Antibody A
Peptide mapping with mass spectrometric detection
revealed three tryptic peptides present in the formulation with citrate
but were absent in the formulation without citrate. These peaks corresponded
to doubly charged ions of peptides with masses of 2051.90 Da (Peptide
B) and 2033.88 Da (Peptides C and D), respectively (Figure S-2 in
the Supporting Information). Peptides C
and D were isobaric yet chromatographically resolved on the C18 RP-HPLC
column and both exhibited greater retention and thus greater hydrophobicity
than Peptide B. The analysis of the MS/MS spectra of Peptides B, C,
and D were in good agreement to each other with the exception of the
18 Da mass shift between some of the b ions but clearly all three
spectra were from the same fragmentation series. Manual de
novo sequencing (Figure S-5 in the Supporting
Information) performed on these peptides revealed high homology
to the predicted y ion series of the N-terminal peptide of the light
chain (Peak A). A comparison of these MS/MS spectra against the experimental
MS/MS spectrum of the N-terminus of the light chain peptide showed
high similarity between the fragmentation patterns as shown in Figure
S-3 in the Supporting Information. The
y ion series between Peak A (Native), Peak B (+174 Da), Peak C and
Peak D (+156 Da) covered all residues in the peptide with the exception
of the N-terminal aspartate. The b ion series, although limited, showed
strong signal with coverage among the first three residues. Consequently,
we were able to assign the observed mass increases to the N-terminus
of the light chain. Thus, the data confirmed that the mass increases
of 156 or 174 Da were from modifications on the light chain N-terminal
amine (i.e., Asp1). Subsequent analysis of the heavy chain N-terminal
peptide of Antibody A did not show any modification.

Elucidation
of the Chemical Nature of the Modifications
No protein modifications
listed in either the ABRF Delta Mass database
(www.abrf.org/index.cfm/dm.home) or the Unimod database
(www.unimod.org) could give rise to the three observed
species. As previously stated, citric acid was only present in the
formulation of the sample where these modifications were found. The
molecular weight of citric acid is 192 Da; therefore, the difference
between the observed variants of +174 Da and +156 Da suggests two
successive losses of water from citric acid. As illustrated in Scheme 1, we propose a mechanism that involves the initial
formation of citric anhydride, the subsequent formation of an amide
with an amino group in the protein (e.g., the N-terminus) that results
in a molecular weight increase of 174 Da. Further condensation of
the resulting amide and another carboxylic group in covalently attached
citric acid leads to the formation of imides (either five- or six-membered),
which confers a molecular weight increase of 156 Da. In addition,
it is reasonable to expect that these two products would form at different
rates favoring the 5-membered product and further supported by the
two +156 isobaric peptides we observed (156A and 156B shown in Figure
S-2 in the Supporting Information). This
mechanism is consistent with the results reported on citrate modification
of peptides and the propensity of citric acid to form an anhydride
under acidic conditions.56−60

Reactions in Citrate Buffers (As Compared to Formulation)
To isolate and narrow down the factors involved in the modification,
antibody A was incubated in citric acid buffer at the same pH (5.2)
but without other formulation excipients (e.g., without mannitol and
polysorbate 80) at 40 °C for 1 month. Similar to the sample from
citrate formulation, the weak cation exchange chromatogram (Figure
S-4 in the Supporting Information) shows
a clear time-dependent increase in the amount of acidic species. In
addition, the formation of the distinct early eluting peak has a comparable
retention time to peak A from the sample formulated in citrate. Similarly,
the reduced LC/MS analysis of the light chain showed a major peak
in good agreement with the theoretical mass and also showed two higher
molecular weight masses with increases of +156 Da and +174 Da but
at a higher abundance than the citrate formulation (Figure S-1 in
the Supporting Information). And again,
tryptic mapping confirmed on the same adducts localized to the N-terminus
of the light chain (data not shown). Thus, these experiments supported
our hypotheses that the citric acid was indeed the modifying agent
causing the heterogeneity on the N-terminus of the light chain. In
addition, we searched for the same modifications on the heavy chain
N-terminal peptide and found trace levels of the +174 Da adduct and
no detection of the +156 Da adduct, thus we saw similar susceptibility
as our stability sample (see Table 1).

+156 Dab refer to the two products formed after the second
anhydride formation. The first 10 residues of the N-terminal framework
of the heavy chains and light chains of antibodies are also listed
(n.d. denotes not detected).

Prevalence of the Citrate Modification
To better understand
the scope of this modification, several additional antibodies were
examined (see Table 1). One was a variant of
Antibody A (Antibody A-S) in which the N-terminus of the light chain
had an aspartate substituted with a glutamate and the N-terminus of
the heavy chain had a glutamate substituted with an aspartate; in
essence, the two termini were swapped. LC/MS analysis of the light
and heavy chains of Antibody A-S showed the same site of modification
and similar susceptibility as Antibody A (see Table 1), suggesting protein structures (such as solvent accessibility)
perhaps play a more dominant role than specific amino acid residues.61−63 Additionally, as shown in Table 1, Antibody
B and Antibody C were also modified by citric acid at the N-termini
of both the light chain and heavy chain. The modification was also
observed on a heavy chain N-terminal alanine residue (data not shown),
suggesting that this modification may occur on other residues at the
N-terminus and the N-terminal acidic side chains (Asp or Glu) are
not obligatory. Thus, the modification of the N-terminal primary amine
by citrate appears to be common among recombinant IgG1 monoclonal
antibodies but may be influenced by other factors such as the antibody
structure and microenvironment.7,8,15,61,62 Furthermore, in all cases, the +174 Da species were more prominent
than the +156 Da species, indicating the former are likely the initial
products as proposed in Scheme 1.

Influence of
pH
As shown in Scheme 1, a key intermediate
for the modification is citric acid anhydride.57−60 Citric acid has three pKas of 3.14,
4.75, and 6.39, so at pH 5.2, one of the carboxylic acids will be
predominantly protonated, a first step for anhydride formation. As
reported, formation of citric acid anhydride occurs between pH 3.0
to 6.0, with the maximum at pH 4.0 to 4.5.56 At pH 5.2 for our formulation, citric acid anhydride can still accumulate
to a significant degree and modify the antibodies. Increasing the
pH to neutral conditions, however, would markedly diminish the formation
of the anhydride, thus little modification of the antibodies (see
Figure S-1 in the Supporting Information, pH 7 data).

Selectivity of Amines
We investigated
whether there
were any citrate modifications to the primary amines of lysine residues
following the accelerated storage conditions. We searched the peptide
mapping data using the Sequest algorithm (ThermoFisher Scientific)
and did not find any modification to lysine residues. In general,
N-terminal amines have a lower pKa (around
8) than those on the side chains of lysine (around 10). Under mildly
acidic conditions (e.g., pH 5.2), though the vast majority of the
N-terminal and lysyl amines are protonated, significant higher percentage
of the N-terminal amines are deprotonated, thereby nucleophilic, and
can react with anhydride. Therefore, the observed selectivity of amines
are consistent with the generally observed reactivities of N-terminal
amines.64,65

Conclusions
Our
results suggest the general susceptibility of the N-terminal
amines to modifications by citric acid. The reactivity is likely influenced
by multiple factors, including pH, pKa at the N-terminal amines, and structural features, therefore the
sites and extent of modification cannot be precisely predicted and
thus should be investigated experimentally. In addition, formulations
with elevated concentrations of citric acid would likely cause a greater
extent of the modification; therefore, it would be prudent to consider
other excipients which may be better suited for the desired pH range.
In particular, other molecules containing two or more juxtaposed carboxylic
acid groups may exhibit analogous reactivities (via the formation
of anhydrides). Examples from the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS)
list include adipic acid, malic acid, succinic acid, and tartaric
acid. Altogether, our findings are yet a reminder that the unexpected
reactivity of excipients and formulation, though generally considered
chemically inert and safe, should be carefully scrutinized.
