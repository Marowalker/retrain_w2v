Top-down hydrogen/deuterium exchange
(HDX) with mass spectrometric
(MS) detection has recently matured to become a potent biophysical
tool capable of providing valuable information on higher order structure
and conformational dynamics of proteins at an unprecedented level
of structural detail. However, the scope of the proteins amenable
to the analysis by top-down HDX MS still remains limited, with the
protein size and the presence of disulfide bonds being the two most
important limiting factors. While the limitations imposed by the physical
size of the proteins gradually become more relaxed as the sensitivity,
resolution and dynamic range of modern MS instrumentation continue
to improve at an ever accelerating pace, the presence of the disulfide
linkages remains a much less forgiving limitation even for the proteins
of relatively modest size. To circumvent this problem, we introduce
an online chemical reduction step following completion and quenching
of the HDX reactions and prior to the top-down MS measurements of
deuterium occupancy of individual backbone amides. Application of
the new methodology to the top-down HDX MS characterization of a small
(99 residue long) disulfide-containing protein β2-microglobulin allowed the backbone amide protection to be probed
with nearly a single-residue resolution across the entire sequence.
The high-resolution backbone protection pattern deduced from the top-down
HDX MS measurements carried out under native conditions is in excellent
agreement with the crystal structure of the protein and high-resolution
NMR data, suggesting that introduction of the chemical reduction step
to the top-down routine does not trigger hydrogen scrambling either
during the electrospray ionization process or in the gas phase prior
to the protein ion dissociation.

==== Body
Since its
initial introduction
in the late 1990s,1−3 top-down hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) with mass
spectrometric (MS) detection evolved to become a potent biophysical
tool capable of providing valuable information on higher order structure
and conformational dynamics of proteins at an unprecedented level
of structural detail. Among the many advantages offered by top-down
HDX MS compared to conventional (bottom-up) measurements are significant
reduction or indeed complete elimination of the back exchange,4 high spatial resolution,5,6 and
the ability to study conformational dynamics in the conformer-specific
fashion.7,8 However, despite the spectacular recent
advances and the broader acceptance of this technique, the scope of
the proteins amenable to the analysis by top-down HDX MS remains limited,
with the protein size and the presence of disulfide bonds being the
two most important limiting factors. The limitations imposed by the
physical size of the proteins gradually become more relaxed as the
sensitivity, resolution, and dynamic range of modern MS instrumentation
continue to improve at an ever accelerating pace. However, the presence
of disulfides remains a much less forgiving limitation even for the
proteins of relatively modest size.

Gas phase cleavage of the
disulfide bonds can be achieved using
either collision-activated dissociation (CAD) of polypeptide anions9−12 or electron-based ion fragmentation techniques.13 Unfortunately, collisional activation of peptide and protein
ions frequently causes hydrogen scrambling to occur prior to the dissociation
event.14 An additional complication arises
due to the fact that the CAD fragments of peptide anions cannot be
assigned as readily as those produced upon dissociation of peptide
cations, as the two dissociation processes frequently follow very
different routes.15 This effectively rules
out negative ion CAD as a robust and efficient tool for top-down HDX
MS/MS measurements. On the other hand, electron-based ion fragmentation
techniques, such as electron-capture dissociation, ECD,13 (and its sister technique, electron transfer
dissociation, ETD16) have been shown to
be capable of generating abundant fragment ions without triggering
hydrogen scrambling in top-down HDX MS/MS studies.17 Furthermore, electron-based dissociation techniques are
also capable of cleaving disulfide linkages in the gas phase18,19 and in fact have been successfully used to separate peptide monomers
linked by unreduced disulfide bonds in bottom-up HDX MS measurements.20

Unfortunately, successful application
of ECD or ETD to top-down
protein sequencing of disulfide-containing proteins requires collisional
activation as a necessary step to improve the fragmentation efficiency.
ECD or ETD of disulfide-containing protein ions carried out in the
absence of collisional heating (to suppress or eliminate hydrogen
scrambling) typically result in inferior sequence coverage and low
abundance of fragment ions, making dissociation of disulfide linkages
in the gas phase poorly suited for HDX MS/MS work. To circumvent this
problem, we explore an alternative approach to characterizing the
higher order structure of disulfide-containing proteins with top-down
HDX MS/MS by introducing online chemical reduction following the quench
of HDX reactions. The concentration of the reducing agent is selected
such that the adequate reduction of the disulfide bonds can be achieved
in solution without causing significant degradation of the protein
ion signal in ESI MS (taking advantage of increased tolerance of modern
ESI MS instrumentation to the presence of limited amounts of nonvolatile
electrolytes in the sprayed solutions). Top-down fragmentation of
protein ions with reduced disulfide bonds using ECD allows the distribution
of deuterium to be mapped across the entire protein backbone with
high spatial resolution. Application of the new methodology to the
top-down HDX MS characterization of a small (99 residue long) disulfide-containing
protein β2-microglobulin allows the backbone amide
protection to be probed with nearly a single-residue resolution.

Experimental
Section
Materials
The recombinant form of β2-microglobulin was expressed as an inclusion body in Escherichia
coli by following the procedure previously described.21 Deuterium oxide (99.9% 2H) was purchased
from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (Tewksbury, MA). Ammonium
bicarbonate, acetic acid, acetonitrile (HPLC grade), and TCEP were
purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA).

Hydrogen Exchange
HDX was initiated by mixing a 1 mg/mL
protein solution in 1H2O (solution A) with 5
mM ammonium bicarbonate dissolved in 2H2O (solution
B) using a previously described home-built continuous-flow apparatus
which comprises three inlets and two sequential high-efficiency mixers.8 HDX reactions were quenched and the protein molecules
were partially reduced using 10 mM TCEP solution in a 1:9 (vol/vol) 2H2O/acetonitrile mixture whose pH was adjusted
to 2.5 with formic acid (solution C). Three syringes used to infuse
solutions A, B, and C were advanced simultaneously by a single Nexus
300 syringe pump (Chemyx, Inc., Stafford, TX), resulting in a dilution
ratio of 1:20 (vol/vol) at the first mixing site and 1:1 (vol/vol)
at the second. The second mixing resulted in a 3:20:18 1H2O/2H2O/acetonitrile mixture with
a final TCEP concentration of 5 mM. Solution C and capillaries downstream
of the second mixer were immersed in an ice–water slurry to
minimize the possible gain of a 2H label by the protein
past the exchange loop. At the gross flow-rate of 246 μL/h,
the lengths of capillaries downstream of the first and second mixers
were selected to allow the exchange reactions to proceed for 6 min
and the reduction at the HDX quench condition to proceed for ∼1.5
min, respectively. The setup was equilibrated for 1 h prior to each
measurement. The exchange end-point sample (β2m**)
was prepared by collecting the outflow of the setup in a sealed microcentrifuge
tube at room temperature for ∼2 h, followed by 30 min incubation
at 40 °C. Measurement of β2m** was performed
on the next day of preparation. As verified by ESI MS, the deuteration
of β2m** was complete.

ESI MS Measurements
ESI MS measurements were carried
out with a SolariX (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) Fourier transform
ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) MS equipped with a 7.0 T superconducting
magnet and a standard ESI source, which was directly connected to
the outlet of the online mixing apparatus. In MS/MS measurements,
protein ions in four successive charge-states (11+ through 14+ for
a TCEP-free sample; 14+ through 17+ for a TCEP-treated sample) were
mass-isolated in the front-end quadrupole filter followed by electron-capture
dissociation (ECD) of precursor ions in the ICR cell of the mass spectrometer.
Typically, 2 000–4 000 scans were accumulated
for each ECD spectrum to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Relatively
mild ion desolvation and isolation conditions were used to ensure
scrambling-free fragmentation of protein ions, as described previously.8

HDX MS/MS Data Analysis
Masses of
fragment ions were
determined as previously described.8 The
cumulative protection of backbone-amides of a certain segment represented
by c- or z-ions was calculated as    where P(Sk(N)) is the total protection
of the N-terminal segment spanning
residues 1 through k, P(Sm(C)) is the total protection of the C-terminal segment
spanning residues 100-m through 99, M (2H) or M (1H) are the masses
of 2H or 1H atoms, and M (ci) or M (zi) are the masses of ci or zi ions. Symbols ∗ and ∗∗
represent data of partially exchanged sample and exchange end-point
sample, respectively. Amide protection at an individual backbone amide
group was determined as    where P(Ri) is the protection of a
backbone amide at residue i. For residues where subsequent
fragment ions were missing, P(Ri) was assigned as    Data analysis was performed using Bruker (Billerica,
MA) DataAnalysis, BioTools packages, and Origin Pro 8.5 (Origin Lab,
Northamption, MA).

Results and Discussion
Although
ECD is capable of cleaving disulfide linkages in the gas
phase,19 the need to avoid hydrogen scrambling
places an additional constraint on experimental conditions by requiring
that collisional activation prior to the ECD event be avoided. Collisional
heating of protein ions has been shown to be an important (and in
many cases critical) accessory to ECD, as it provides internal energy
necessary for physical separation of fragment ions produced by ECD.22 The enhancement of the ECD yields by collisional
heating is particularly noticeable for protein ions produced under
near-native conditions, as it disrupts the network of hydrogen bonds
(many of which survive transition from solution to the gas phase)
that may otherwise prevent physical separation of protein fragments
produced by the backbone cleavages. Although the complex and highly
organized network of native hydrogen bonds is unlikely to survive
acidification of the protein solution (which is used to quench the
exchange reactions prior to MS measurements), disulfide-containing
proteins are likely to be an exception, as the conformational constraints
introduced by the cross-chain disulfide linkages can (and frequently
do) reinforce the residual structure even under denaturing conditions.23−25

ECD of unlabeled β2m placed in an acidic
quench
solution gives rise to abundant c- and z-fragment ions even in the
absence of collisional heating of the protein ions. However, a detailed
examination of this set of fragment ions reveals that nearly all of
them are derived from the N- and C-terminal segments of the protein
before and after the two cysteine residues connected by the disulfide
bond (Figure 1), with very few of the observed
fragments representing backbone cleavages within the (Cys25–Cys80) segment. In fact, even though complete
sequence coverage at near-single residue resolution is achieved outside
the disulfide-bridged region, the scarcity of the structurally diagnostic
ions derived from the (Cys25–Cys80) segment
suggests that ECD of both the disulfide bond and backbone N–C(α)
bonds under conditions minimizing hydrogen scrambling cannot be effectively
used in topdown HDX MS measurements.

generated by ESI from TCEP-free (red) and 5 mM TCEP (black) solutions.
Dashed delimiters represent fragments whose ionic signals are not
sufficiently abundant to be used in top-down HDX MS measurements (these
ions were not used in calculating the sequence coverage). The positions
of the two cysteine residues are indicated in orange both within the
protein sequence and the tertiary structure of the protein (the gray-colored
region shows the protein segment that fails to produce abundant c-
and z-ions in the absence of TCEP in solution).

The common approach to reducing disulfide bonds in bottom-up
HDX
MS measurements is to use a reducing agent that remains at least partially
active under the acidic (slow exchange) conditions, such as tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine
(TCEP).26 Upon completion of the proteolytic
step, TCEP and its oxidized form are removed from the sample during
the fast LC step. However, this approach cannot be used in the top-down
HDX MS measurements, which almost always utilize direct infusion of
the protein solution to the ESI source to increase the data acquisition
window and do not allow the desalting step to be introduced prior
to protein ionization.

Although TCEP is a weak acid (with the
pKa values ranging from 2.9 to 7.727), the presence of a basic site (ternary phosphorus)
alongside three
acidic ones (carboxylic groups) makes it an ionic compound at any
pH (even the electrically neutral species of TCEP being a zwitterion).
The ionic character of TCEP in solution makes it behave in a fashion
similar to strong electrolytes vis-à-vis influencing the quality
of ESI mass spectra of protein solutions containing such species:
the degradation of the quality is caused both by highly abundant ionic
signals of the electrolytes and their clusters and by forming multiple
adducts of protein ions.28,29 Nevertheless, continuous
improvements in the design of commercial ESI sources have made them
noticeably more tolerant to the presence of moderate amounts of strong
nonvolatile electrolytes; in fact, it is now possible to obtain abundant
signal of relatively large proteins in ESI MS of solutions containing
low millimolar quantities of NaCl and other nonvolatile salts.30 This prompted us to evaluate the feasibility
of using moderate amounts of TCEP as a reducing agent in top-down
HDX MS measurements without removing it from the protein solution
prior to the ESI step.

The presence of 5 mM TCEP in the ∼2
μM solution of
β2m at pH 2.5 does give rise to the ionic peaks representing
TCEP clusters as well as the oxidized form of TCEP (P-oxide, TCEPO), but their overall abundance is comparable to that
of the protein ions (Figure 2). Furthermore,
formation of the protein-TCEP adducts is negligible under these conditions.
Complete reduction of the disulfide bridge in β2m
could not be achieved using such a relatively modest amount of TCEP
in the protein solution and suboptimal conditions (low pH and temperature),
as suggested by the appearance of the isotopic distributions of peaks
representing β2m ions at charge states 12+ and lower
(Figure 2). At the same time, the mass spectrum
contains abundant protein ion peaks at higher charge density (up to
17+), which have not been observed or had very low abundance in the
TCEP-free solution of this protein. Isotopic distributions of these
ions clearly indicate that the disulfide bond is reduced (mass shift
by 2 units, see Figure 2).

Figure 2 ESI mass spectra of 2
μM β2m in TCEP-free
(blue) and 5 mM TCEP-containing (red) quench solutions. Peaks labeled
with circles correspond to TCEP and TCEPO clusters. The two side panels
show isotopic distributions of protein ions at charge states 11+ and
14+ generated from TCEP-free (blue) and TCEP-containing (red) solutions.

The emergence of this population
of relatively high charge density
protein ions with reduced cysteine residues provides multiple benefits
vis-à-vis the top-down HDX MS measurements. First, the increased
charge on the protein ion makes the electron capture process more
efficient by increasing the effective cross-section of the electron–polycation
interaction.31 Furthermore, increase of
the protein ion charge state indicates loss of compactness in solution32 (triggered by the elimination of the constraint
imposed by the disulfide bond), making it highly unlikely that the
conformation of these proteins in the gas phase will have native-like
hydrogen bonds that would prevent physical separation of the protein
ion fragments produced by fission of the backbone. Indeed, ECD of
the β2m ions generated by ESI of the TCEP-containing
solution of this protein results in facile cleavages of most of the
N–C(α) bonds across the entire protein sequence, including
the (Cys25–Cys80) region (Figure 1). Overall, 80 abundant c- or z-ions are observed
in the ECD spectrum, providing a 70% coverage of the protein sequence
at single-residue resolution with an additional 22% of the sequence
covered at two-residue resolution. The large number of fragment ions
results in spectral congestion, leading to partial overlaps of isotopic
distributions of some fragment ions; in most cases these overlaps
can be resolved (see the Supporting Information for more detail).

The cumulative protection maps of backbone
amides within the N-
and C-terminal segments of the protein (calculated based on the measured
deuterium content of either c- or z-fragment ions generated by ECD
of the β2m ions produced by ESI of the protein solution
where the amide exchange was quenched and the disulfide bridges partially
reduced by TCEP) show a very uneven distribution of amide protection
across the protein backbone (Figure 3, top).
A more intuitive presentation of these data shows protection levels
of individual backbone amides, which were calculated for each residue
by subtracting the deuterium content of adjacent fragments in either
the c- or z-ladder (Figure 3, bottom). The
absolute value of the most negative P(Ri) (0.1) was treated as the extreme value of error
oscillation, and any residue Ri where
the value of P(Ri) exceeded
0.2 (the double of 0.1) was regarded as a residue having significant
protection. This protection map is generally in good agreement with
the secondary structure of β2m (shown in Figure 3 using line notations) deduced from the X-ray crystal
structure of this protein,33 although some
discrepancy does exist. For example, relatively low protection was
observed for most residues comprising β-strand 4 (residues 52–55),
while noticeable protection was detected at residue 51, which immediately
precedes this strand. In order to understand the origin of this anomaly,
top-down HDX MS data were compared with the protection factors derived
from previously reported high-resolution NMR measurements.34 The NMR-derived protection data (which are usually
considered to be a better representation of dynamic structures of
proteins in solution) are also mapped on the β2m
sequence in Figure 3 and clearly show that
several β-strand of this protein are noticeably dynamic. In
fact, no protection is detected within the residues comprising β-strand
5, with strand 1 also showing highly dynamic character. Overall, there
is a remarkable agreement between the backbone protection patterns
derived from the high-resolution NMR and top down HDX MS measurements.
Disagreements between the two data sets exceeding the experimental
error were noted for only a few residues (e.g., Glu44,
Glu47, and Val85) and are likely caused by difference
in solution conditions (such as pH, buffer makeup, ionic strength,
and temperature) and expectedly by spatially unresolved residues’
splitting their total deuterium contents. It might also be possible
that some of the isotopic distributions of β2m fragment
ions produced by cleavages of the backbone outside of the protein
segment between the two cysteine residues may have contributions from
the oxidized form of the protein. This would introduce a change in
the apparent deuterium content by shifting the fragment ion mass.
However, the contribution of the oxidized (disulfide-intact) species
to the pool of fragment ions representing the backbone cleavage between
the two cysteine residues is negligible (see Figure 1), while the masses of fragment ions produced by cleavages
of the backbone outside of this segment do not depend on the oxidation
state of the cysteine residues. The excellent agreement between the
backbone protection patterns of β2m derived from
the top-down HDX MS and high-resolution NMR measurements clearly suggests
that hydrogen scrambling does not occur during or prior to the ECD
fragmentation of the protein ions.

as measured by NMR.34

Conclusions
In this work we demonstrated feasibility of
applying top-down HDX
MS measurements to characterize higher order structure and conformational
dynamics of disulfide-containing proteins, which have been out of
the reach of this technique so far. Use of a moderate amount of a
reducing agent TCEP is compatible with the ESI process, while allowing
a fraction of the protein molecules to be reduced in solution thereby
enabling near-complete sequence coverage at high resolution. The agreement
between the top-down HDX MS and NMR data sets demonstrate that the
new experimental approach is capable of capturing the dynamic picture
of protein conformation at high spatial resolution without compromising
the quality of the data by triggering hydrogen scrambling in the gas
phase. Despite its modest size, β2m is known to be
able to populate a non-native state,35 which
might be a key player in a variety of processes, including amyloidosis.
However, the structure of this non-native state of β2m remains elusive since this conformer exists in dynamic equilibrium
with the native state of the protein.36,37 Recently we
demonstrated that top-down HDX MS provides an elegant way to selectively
probe structure of protein states coexisting in solution at equilibrium;8 however, β2m remained out of
reach of this technique until recently due to the presence of a disulfide
bond. The ability to expand the scope of top-down HDX MS to disulfide-containing
proteins opens up a host of exciting possibilities to explore the
structure of β2m, interferon, lysozyme, and a variety
of other disulfide-containing proteins in a conformer-specific fashion,
where physiologically important non-native states may play important
roles in processes as diverse as folding, recognition, signaling,
and amyloidosis.
