Cross-linking
mass spectrometry is an emerging structural biology
technique. Almost exclusively, the analyzer of choice for such an
experiment has been the Orbitrap. We present an optimized protocol
for the use of a Synapt G2-Si for the analysis of cross-linked peptides.
We first tested six different energy ramps and analyzed the fragmentation
behavior of cross-linked peptides identified by xQuest. By combining
the most successful energy ramps, cross-link yield can be increased
by up to 40%. When compared to previously published Orbitrap data,
the Synapt G2-Si also offers improved fragmentation of the β
peptide. In order to improve cross-link quality control we have also
developed ValidateXL, a programmatic solution that works with existing
cross-linking software to improve cross-link quality control.

==== Body
Cross-linking
mass spectrometry
(XLMS) can be used to gain structural insights into proteins and complexes
that cannot easily be studied by high-resolution structural techniques.1,2 Cross-linking is based on the covalent bonding of two amino acids
that lie within a certain proximity. This low-resolution fixation
of structure provides information on both distance restraints and
solvent accessibility. Following digestion of the cross-linked species,
a mixture containing both linear and cross-linked peptides is produced.
One of the challenges of a cross-linking experiment is that cross-links
are low in abundance. As a result, their signal is often suppressed
by more intense linear peptide ions during analysis.3 Earlier studies utilized an LTQ-Orbitrap mass analyzer,
with most experimental designs using linear ion trap (LIT) for both
collision-induced dissociation (CID) and analysis of fragment ion
spectra.4−6 The lower resolution data obtained using the LIT,
however, may lead to incorrect assignments of peptide sequence. This
in turn causes an increased risk of missed or false positive cross-link
assignment. Current developments in the field now recognize that the
accuracy of this analyzer is insufficient to correctly annotate fragment
ions, with higher energy collision dissociation (HCD) becoming the
dominant analysis method.7

Recent
advancements in time-of-flight (TOF) technology have allowed
an increase in achievable resolving power, providing fragment ion
scans up to 40 000 fwhm.8 In addition,
TOF resolving power does not depend on acquisition time, offering
a near constant resolution across the mass range and faster scan speeds
compatible with ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)
for both precursor and fragment ion scans.9,10 Furthermore,
the ability to seamlessly integrate quadrupole time-of-flight analysers
(QTOFs) with ion mobility separation (IMS) offers an extra degree
of separation by size, shape, and charge, without the requisite need
for additional analysis time.11 This potentially
provides an opportunity to increase cross-link yield through exploitation
of the larger and more highly charged nature of cross-linked peptides.

Although cross-linked peptides have been studied using a variety
of analyzers, including QTOFs,18,29−31 the majority of cross-linking studies have been performed on Orbitrap
mass analyzers. As a consequence, current cross-linking software has
been optimized for Orbitrap data. Furthermore, a recent study showed
that HCD and ion trap CID required different collision energies for
optimal fragmentation of cross-linked peptides.12 It is therefore also necessary to perform optimization
of collision energies for the analysis of cross-linked peptides on
a QTOF instrument.

Here, we present an optimized method for
the analysis of cross-linked
peptides analyzed using a QTOF geometry. We performed triplicate analysis
of six different energy ramps in order to determine the optimal energy
for cross-link fragmentation. The resulting approach allows QTOF data
to be analyzed with existing cross-linking software, xQuest,13 with minimal adaptations. We analyze the effects
of collision energy on the fragmentation efficiency of bovine serum
albumin cross-linked with isotopically labeled bis(sulfosuccinimdyl)
suberate (BS 3d0d12). We offer a programmatic solution, ValidateXL.py,
which works with result files from xQuest to improve cross-link quality
control and reduce manual validation. This software is freely available
to download at https://github.com/ThalassinosLab/ValidateXL. Finally, in contrast
to data collected from Orbitrap analyzers14 we also demonstrate improved fragmentation of the β peptide
in the cross-link.

Results and Discussion
In order
to determine the most efficient settings for cross-link
fragmentation using a QTOF, a comparison of fragmentation energies
was carried out using the collision energy ramps described. The ramps
were tested in triplicate using cross-linked bovine serum albumin
(BSA). Data were then analyzed by xQuest according to the workflow
outlined in Figure 1A. Although only minor adaptations were necessary, QTOF data sets
were not immediately readable and required further conversion by MSConvert.
In addition, a far greater number of cross-link identifications were
found, with improved scores, when using the slow de-isotoping algorithm
during data processing at both the precursor and fragment ion level
(Figure S1, parts A and B, and Table S1).

xQuest with Waters QTOF
data. (B) Comparison of xQuest scores for all identified unique BSA
cross-link peptide pairs across six energy ramps: scores above 20
(purple), scores below 20 (lilac). Numbers above bars indicate a count
of cross-links scoring above 20. (C) Mean and standard deviation for
number of manually validated unique BSA cross-link peptide pairs in
triplicate analysis of all six energy ramps.

Cross-links that pass a prescoring filter are all returned
to the
user by xQuest. A final score threshold of 30 was originally recommended
to determine true positive cross-link identifications.15 More recent analysis revised this score to 16
for trypsin digests where this work also revealed a dependence of
score threshold on the enzyme used to digest samples.16 Following evaluation of the various scoring thresholds
we chose a conservative score of 20 in our initial validation (Figures S2–S4). All identified unique
BSA cross-linked peptides are shown in Figure 1B. Unique cross-links include those with
linkages in the same absolute position but with different peptide
lengths and/or modifications such as oxidized methionine.12

Overall, there is good reproducibility
in the cross-links scoring
above 20 (Figures S5–S10). The technical
replicates of the mid energy ramp contain the greatest degree of overlap
with 38 identical cross-link residue pairs appearing in all three
repeats. The high-iTRAQ and mid-iTRAQ repeats contain an intersection
of 23 and 22 identifications, respectively (Figures S5–S8). The mid energy ramp is the most reproducible
and identifies the most high-scoring cross-links: 103, 111, and 131
in the respective triplicate analysis.

Cross-links were then
manually validated in the raw data by confirming
their charge, mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), and the presence of doublet precursors with a 12 Da mass shift,
corresponding to the d0 and d12 versions of the cross-linker. Figure 1C shows the mean
and standard deviation for the validated cross-links found in the
triplicate studies. The wide energy ramp and those including the iTRAQ
(isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) method display
the highest degree of variability. This is most likely due to the
broad range of energies sampled by these ramps. The iTRAQ method and
the wide energy ramp expose peptides to low collision energies irrespective
of their m/z. The iTRAQ method does
so in a temporal manner with 50% of the scan time devoted to these
low ranges.17 The wide energy ramp encompasses
the full range of energies tested by all five ramps. As the m/z of the cross-link increases the range
of energies it is exposed to also increases. Thus, by reducing the
selectivity of the energy range a greater distribution of fragmentation
patterns are observed. This most likely leads to greater variability
in the number of cross-links identified. In Figure 1C the high-iTRAQ method shows the best performance
of all energy ramps. This is due to variability in the performance
of the second and third technical replicates (Figure S2) and is most likely the result of the broader range
of energies applied in the iTRAQ method. At higher scoring thresholds
the mid energy ramp continues to perform the best (Figure S4). The combination of all three triplicates analyzed
using the mid energy ramp identified the highest number, some 277
unique cross-links (see the Supporting Information). As defined above, unique cross-links are described by their sequence
not solely their position. Hence, this high number of identifications
is due to differences in peptide lengths and modifications.

To assess the fragmentation patterns of the cross-links tandem
mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra were interrogated for the presence
of cross-linked and linear fragment ions. Figure 2 shows spectra for one of the three cross-links
identified by all of the energy ramps (see also Figure S11 for another such peptide). Ions corresponding to
cross-linked fragments are shown in red, and linear ones are in blue.
It can be seen that the high energy ramp contains no cross-linked
fragment ions. The sequence coverage of the low and wide energy ramps
are considerably worse, with the base peak in the wide energy ramp
representing the intact cross-linked precursor. As this ramp covers
a vast range of energies over the course of the scan, insufficient
time is spent at any one energy to achieve efficient fragmentation.
The mid energy ramp appears to offer the best fragmentation for this
cross-link, providing the highest degree of sequence coverage. It
should also be noted that, despite the poor sequence coverage of the
cross-link in both the low and wide energy ramps, xQuest scores each
favorably at 26 and 30, respectively. This shows that although a score
threshold is necessary it is not sufficient to differentiate reliable
cross-link identifications.

Figure 2 Example spectra for cross-link ID DTHKSEIAHR-FKDLGEEHFK
(a4, b2). Cross-linked fragment ions are shown in red, and linear
fragment ions are in blue. xQuest scores are shown in brackets. A
loss of cross-linked fragment ions is observed in the high energy
ramp.

xQuest distinguishes between the
two types of fragment ions and
scores the correlation between the observed and theoretical fragment
ion spectra separately for each type of ion. The results of these
correlations are reported as two subscores: XCorrx for cross-linked
fragment ions and XCorrb for linear fragment ions. In order to better
visualize the effects of the ramps on each type of fragment ion produced,
a kernel density estimation (KDE) was performed on the XCorrx and
XCorrb subscores. Kernel density estimation estimates the underlying
probability distribution from which a sample is drawn. It requires
that each instance within the sample is both independent and identically
distributed. Parts A and B of Figure 3 show a comparison of the estimated distribution for
both the linear fragment ion correlation score and the cross-linked
fragment ion correlation score, for the high, mid, and low energy
ramps.

Figure 3 KDE comparison of high (blue), mid (green), and low (red) energy
ramps across (A) XCorrb and (B) XCorrx xQuest subscores.

For the linear fragment ion correlation the low
ramp performs poorly
while the high ramp performs well, as indicated by the shifts in KDE
in Figure 3A. This
suggests that at lower energies linear peptides are fragmenting less
efficiently. In Figure 3B the opposite phenomenon is observed. For cross-linked fragment
ions the low ramp performs better than the high ramp. These results
demonstrate an opposing effect between preserving cross-linked fragments
and obtaining sufficient sequence coverage for linear peptides. It
is, therefore, not surprising that the mid energy ramp provides a
higher overall number of cross-link identifications when used in combination
with the xQuest analysis software.

To further examine the fragmentation
patterns associated with each
ramp, we analyzed the data for the presence of BS3/DSS diagnostic
ions18 (Figure 4). These ions have previously been identified
in 71% of cross-link spectra analyzed by HCD.19 In good agreement with previous studies we find that at high energy
52% of cross-link spectra contain the tetrahydropyridine modification
(Table 1). The negative
XCorrx scores in the high energy are likely due to the fragmentation
of the cross-linker amide bond preventing the observation of cross-linked
fragment ions.

16.0.
Diagnostic ions are created by fragmentation of the amide bond in
the cross-linker.

When cross-links
are utilized in structural modeling approaches,
cross-link residue pairs, defined solely by their position in the
structure, are of paramount importance.2,20 To compare
in detail the effects of the collision energy ramps on residue pair
identifications, cross-links were further validated using in-house
software (Figure 5A).
The program works with the xQuest xml result files to filter cross-links
based on whether the identification meets the more recent published
standards for confident cross-link assignment.7 These include signal/noise, fragmentation of both peptides, and
the presence of both cross-linked and linear fragment ions. As expected,
these more stringent criteria lower the overall number of identifications
(Figure 5B).

Figure 5 (A) Schematic
representation of ValidateXL.py workflow. (B) Overlap
of validated cross-links for the three best performing ramps. As limited
overlap in cross-links is observed between the ramps, identification
rates can be increased by combining one or more energy ramp.

The identifications exposed by
the high ramp were reduced significantly,
with a mean cross-link identification rate of 11 (Figure S12). As mentioned, this is most likely due to the
loss of cross-linked fragment ions. The mid ramp remains the best
performing identifying 37, 37, and 39 cross-links in each of the technical
repeats (Table S2). In addition, the intersection
of the three best performing ramps shows that there is little overlap
between the identifications made by each one (Figure 5B). (The intersection for all energy ramps
is shown in Figure S13.)

Incorporating
one or more energy ramp leads to a higher number
of cross-link identifications. This can be explained by the relationship
between fragmentation efficiency and m/z.21 Cross-links are composed of two peptides
each with their own optimal fragmentation energy. By combining different
energy ramps, optimal fragmentation of up to 40% more diverse cross-link
identities can be achieved (Figure 5B).

It has frequently been reported that fragmentation
of both peptides
within a cross-link is not symmetric.7,12,14,19 One peptide, in most
cases the larger of the two, will fragment more readily than the other,
so a higher sequence coverage is observed. In line with xQuest we
define the larger of the two peptides within the cross-link as the
α peptide for this analysis. Figure 6 displays the distribution of annotated peaks
for both the α (lilac) and β (purple) peptides within
the cross-links. Across most of the energy ramps the α peptide
fragments more than the β peptide, with the only exception being
the low ramp. However, annotation of both peptides is higher than
40%. This is in contrast to previous reports, when using both ion
trap CID14 and HCD12 with an Orbitrap analyzer, where the β peptide consistently
displayed poorer fragmentation. In the case of ion trap CID only 22%
of the most intense annotated fragment ions corresponded to the β
peptide.14 Kolbowski et al. attribute this
phenomenon to the nature of cross-linked peptides rather than the
cross-linker used.12

Figure 6 Relative frequency of
annotated α and β fragment peaks
from identified ions. The height refers to the mean for each energy
ramp. Error bars display the standard deviation.

One possible explanation for this difference in β-peptide
annotation may involve the way fragmentation energy values by vendor
instrument operator software are calculated. Normalized collision
energy reported by ThermoScientific is a linear percentage of the
available collision energy, which compensates for the mass dependency
of optimal collision energy.22 An ion of
a particular m/z value will be exposed
to a single energy value. As previously discussed, the Waters Corporation
energy ramp exposes a precursor of a particular m/z to a range of energies across the course of a
scan. As cross-links are a combination of two peptides, each with
different m/z ranges, this may be
advantageous; the optimal energy for fragmentation is unlikely to
be related solely to the m/z of
the entire species.

xQuest does not consider ions generated
through fragmentation of
both peptides in a cross-link. As the software was written to using
data from fragment ions generated by ion trap CID, with a mass range
of 200–2000 Da, immonium ions are also not considered. These
ions are diagnostic of the presence of specific amino acids in a peptide
and are often used in de novo peptide sequencing. During analysis
of fragment ion spectra the presence of these ions was found to inhibit
rather than enhance the xQuest scoring algorithms. Figure 7 shows the fragment ion spectra
of a monolink identified by xQuest. Immonium ions for both lysine,
following the loss of ammonia (84 Da) and valine (72 Da), are present
and indicated in the figure. The mass shift between these ions is
12 Da; xQuest has erroneously identified the peak at 84 Da as a cross-linked
peak. Although xQuest can be modified to include a wider mass range,
it cannot annotate the peaks correctly as the algorithms do not expect
the presence of immonium ions. As the correlation algorithm does not
have a low-mass cutoff this leads to unannotated peaks in the spectra
and poorer overall correlation of the theoretical and observed cross-linked
fragment ions. Adjustment of the xQuest search parameters to include
a wider mass range is therefore not recommended as a necessary modification
for searching QTOF data.

loss of ammonia)

peak determination affects scoring algorithms.

Conclusion
QTOF mass spectrometers are ubiquitous in most
lines of MS research
including metabolomics, proteomics, and small-molecule analysis; however,
they have not yet been widely applied to the field of cross-linking
mass spectrometry. We have shown that QTOF instruments can indeed
be used to analyze cross-linked peptide samples and that data from
this instrument configuration can be processed directly with existing
cross-linking software applications, with little modification to their
parameters. Due to the unique divergent energy ramp that applies a
range of energies across each scan we have demonstrated that the Synapt
G2-Si offers improved fragmentation of the β peptide when compared
with published data collected on an Orbitrap instrument.12,14 Our analysis also shows that, by combining two energy ramps that
occupy alternate energy ranges, different cross-links can be identified.
This presents a unique opportunity to improve cross-link yield by
up to 40%.

Given that adaptation to collision energy is not
required for the
analysis of different cross-linker chemistries by an Orbitrap,23 this protocol could be applicable to a broad
range of cross-linkers. This includes the widely used MS cleavable
cross-linkers.24,25

In addition, validation
of the results is laborious; time requirements
increase with cross-link yield. Employment of a simple score threshold
serves only as a guide. We offer a programmatic solution which works
directly with the xQuest result xml file to gain confidence in the
results generated from the search. This enables cross-link identifications
to feed directly into structural modeling approaches, as we have previously
shown that higher quality cross-link identifications are more beneficial
for modeling purposes.20,26,27

Finally, the development of an optimized method for the analysis
of cross-linked peptides on a QTOF provides the groundwork for exploration
of the addition of IMS to a cross-linking experiment. This gas-phase
fractionation is conducted online and may lead to a reduction in sample
preparation requirements. Furthermore, the extra separation provided
by IMS separates low-intensity ions from chemical noise allowing the
data-dependent acquisition (DDA) process to select them for MS/MS.

Experimental
Section
Reagents and Apparatus
BSA (A7030) and BS3 d0/d12 were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and Creative Molecule
Inc., respectively. Rapigest and solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges
(50 mg Sep-Pak C18) were purchased from Waters Corporation (Milford,
MA, U.S.A.). The Superdex Peptide PC 3.2/3.0 column was purchased
from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ).

Sample Preparation
Amounts of 0.3 mg/mL BSA and 1 mg
BS3 d0/d12 were prepared in 20 mM HEPES at pH 7.6. The cross-linker
was added to the protein and diluted to a final concentration of 2.5
mM BS3 d0/d12. The sample was then incubated at room temperature for
40 min under mild agitation. Following incubation, the reaction was
quenched by adding 1 M ammonium bicarbonate to a final concentration
of 50 mM. The samples were then evaporated to dryness in a vacuum
concentrator and resuspended in 8 M urea at 1.1 mg/mL concentration.

A solution of 1% RapiGest to a final concentration of 0.1% was
added to aid solubilization before digestion. The sample was then
incubated with 10 mM dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 30 min to denature
the protein and reduce the disulfide bonds. Following incubation,
the sample was cooled to room temperature. In order to prevent disulfide
bond reformation iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration
of 20 mM. As iodoacetamide is unstable when exposed to light the mixture
was incubated in the dark, at room temperature for 30 min. The sample
was then diluted with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate to reduce the final
concentration of urea to <1 M. Trypsin 50:1 protein to enzyme was
added to the sample. The reaction mixture was incubated overnight
at 37 °C with mild agitation. Following overnight incubation
enzymatic activity was quenched by adding formic acid to a final concentration
of 2% (v/v). In preparation for size exclusion chromatography (SEC)
fractionation the sample was purified using Sep-Pak SPE cartridges
and evaporated to dryness.

Following SPE the sample was resuspended
in 20 μL of SEC
buffer (degassed water/acetonitrile/TFA at 70/30/0.1 v/v/v). An amount
of 15 μL of sample was injected onto an equilibrated Superdex
Peptide column. Fractions of 100 μL were collected. The samples
were then evaporated to dryness and resuspended in 10 μL of
liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) buffer:
95% H2O, 5% acetonitrile, and 0.1% formic acid.

LC–MS/MS
Analysis
Samples were introduced using
nano ultraperformance liquid chromatograph (10kPsi nanoACQUITY Waters)
with buffers (A) MS grade water with 0.1% formic acid and (B) MS grade
acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. Samples were desalted by a reversed-phase
Symmetry C18 trap column (180 μm internal diameter, 20 mm length,
5 μm particle size, Waters Corporation) at a flow rate of 8
μL/min for 3 min in 99% buffer A. Peptides were then separated
using a linear gradient (0.3 μL/min, 35 °C; 97–60%
buffer A over 90 min) using a BEH130 C18 nanocolumn (75 μm internal
diameter, 400 mm length, 1.7 μm particle size, Waters Corporation).
The TOF analyzer was externally calibrated from m/z 175.11 to 1285.54 using [Glu1]-fibrinopeptide
B at 500 fmol/μL.

Data-Dependent Acquisition
Samples
were analyzed using
a Waters Synapt G2-Si quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer
tuned to a resolution of 20 000 (fwhm). Accurate mass measurements
were made using DDA. The top 10 most intense precursors with charge
states between +3 and +7 were selected over a mass range of 50–3000
Da with a scan time of 0.15 s and an interscan delay of 0.05 s. MS2
spectra were acquired using collision energy ramps specified in Table 2.

Cross-Linking Analysis
Raw files were processed in
PLGS v3.2.0 (Waters) using slow de-isotoping algorithm for both MS
and MS2 data. After PLGS processing, the files are exported in mascot
generic format (mgf) and further converted to mzXML format for input
to xQuest.4 Conversion to mzXML was accomplished
with MSConvert (v3.0.7414) using 32-bit binary encryption.

xQuest
was designed and trained on sample data obtained from an Orbitrap
mass analyzer operated with ion trap CID, as such modifications to
the search parameters were necessary to accommodate QTOF data. These
can be found in Tables S3–S7. Briefly,
data obtained from an Orbitrap mass analyzer differs from data obtained
in a QTOF as it is not deconvoluted and contains multiple charge state
fragment ions. Tolerance for peak matching was adjusted to 5 ppm for
precursors and 10 ppm for fragment ions. Additional search parameters
included the following: cross-linking was assumed to occur with lysines,
tyrosine, serine, threonine, and the protein N′ terminus; two
possible missed cleavages; variable modification of methionine oxidation;
fixed modification of cysteine carbamidomethylation. The mass spectrometry
proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium
via the PRIDE28 partner repository with
the data set identifier PXD011704.

ValidateXL
ValidateXL
is available to download at https://github.com/ThalassinosLab/ValidateXL.

ValidateXL.py is a python script written in Python 3.5. ValidateXL.py
analyses the xQuest merged_xquest.xml files which are generated and
stored in the xQuest result file after a completed search.

ValidateXL
extracts information from the XML files to assess the
quality of a cross-link identification based upon the signal/ratio
of both the cross-linked and linear fragment ions. It filters cross-links
and creates three CSV files: cross-links which are of significantly
high quality to be used for modeling, cross-links that require manual
validation, and cross-links that should be rejected. ValidateXL requires
the XML and fasta files for the protein of interest and will run on
multiple xQuest search results. For full description and details on
usage can be found in the Supporting Information.
