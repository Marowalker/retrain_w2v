We compared the five
different ways of fragmentation available
on a tribrid mass spectrometer and optimized their collision energies
with regard to optimal sequence coverage of cross-linked peptides.
We created a library of bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3/DSS) cross-linked
precursors, derived from the tryptic digests of three model proteins
(Human Serum Albumin, creatine kinase, and myoglobin). This enabled
in-depth targeted analysis of the fragmentation behavior of 1065 cross-linked
precursors using the five fragmentation techniques: collision-induced
dissociation (CID), beam-type CID (HCD), electron-transfer dissociation
(ETD), and the combinations ETciD and EThcD. EThcD gave the best sequence
coverage for cross-linked m/z species
with high charge density, while HCD was optimal for all others. We
tested the resulting data-dependent decision tree against collision
energy-optimized single methods on two samples of differing complexity
(a mix of eight proteins and a highly complex ribosomal cellular fraction).
For the high complexity sample the decision tree gave the highest
number of identified cross-linked peptide pairs passing a 5% false
discovery rate (on average ∼21% more than the second best,
HCD). For the medium complexity sample, the higher speed of HCD proved
decisive. Currently, acquisition speed plays an important role in
allowing the detection of cross-linked peptides against the background
of linear peptides. Enrichment of cross-linked peptides will reduce
this role and favor methods that provide spectra of higher quality.

==== Body
A typical
cross-linking/mass
spectrometry (CLMS) workflow includes the chemical cross-linking of
the protein(s) and digestion into peptides, followed by liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis.1−4 Bifunctional cross-linkers covalently link two amino
acid residues, which are in close proximity, preserving structural
information that would otherwise be lost through digestion. Identifying
a cross-linked peptide yields structural information in the form of
distance constraints about single proteins (intraprotein cross-links)
or the arrangement of multiprotein complexes or protein–protein
interactions (interprotein cross-links).

Fragmentation of peptides
is a crucial step in almost every proteomics
experiment.5 Advances in mass spectrometers
make a diverse range of fragmentation methods increasingly available.
Collision-induced dissociation (CID)6 is
a well-established and popular fragmentation method for linear peptides
and has also been investigated in detail for cross-linked peptides.7 Specifically, beam-type CID, sometimes referred
to as higher-energy C-trap dissociation (HCD),8 has recently shown promising results for diazerine photo-cross-linked
peptides.9 Electron transfer dissociation
(ETD) emerged as a complementary method to CID, breaking the peptide
backbone in a different place, thus resulting in different fragment
ions. ETD is used widely in the analysis of post-translational modifications
(PTMs),10 but has also been applied to
cross-linked peptide analysis, for example, as part of a sequential
CID-ETD-MS/MS fragmentation scheme.11 ETD
often suffers from incomplete fragmentation, leading to a large amount
of residual precursor ions.12 To address
this drawback, ETD methods using supplemental activation with either
CID or HCD have been developed, giving rise to EThcD12 and ETciD13 as ETD-based methods
with improved sequence coverage. A tribrid mass spectrometer (Orbitrap
Fusion Lumos, Thermo Fisher Scientific) is capable of applying all
five above-described fragmentation approaches.

For linear peptides,
multiple studies have compared different fragmentation
methods to show precursor m/z and
charge dependencies of the respective fragmentation methods.14,15 These have arrived at a data-dependent decision tree (DDDT) logic
that applies the best performing fragmentation method for each precursor,
depending on its properties. DDDT, therefore, provides higher quality
MS2 spectra by fully utilizing the capabilities of modern mass spectrometers.
High-quality spectra are of particular significance for CLMS experiments,
since the possible pairwise combinations for cross-linked peptides
increase quadratically with an increasing number of peptides in the
search database.2 This so-called n-squared
problem leads to comparably large search spaces where good peptide
sequence coverage is favorable to minimize false identifications.

Recently, a study optimizing fragmentation of succinimidyl 4,4-azipentanoate
(SDA) photo-cross-linked peptide from the model protein HSA proved
HCD as the method of choice for a low complexity sample and proposed
a decision tree for samples of higher complexity.9 In this study, we investigated the commonly used bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate
(BS3) cross-linker. Optimization was done on cross-linked precursors
derived from three different model proteins. Furthermore, we applied
a very thorough method development approach with a wider fragmentation
parameter optimization. We performed in-depth targeted analysis on
a library of 1065 verified cross-linked m/z species (FDR and crystal structure controlled) to find
the optimal fragmentation method and normalized collision energy (NCE)
for cross-linked peptides depending on their mass and charge. The
resulting DDDT with optimized sequence coverage for cross-linked peptides
was evaluated on samples with diverging protein complexity and database
size. In addition to determining the best performing method in a single
injection, we also looked into combining the different fragmentation
methods to find the best performing combination when injecting up
to three times the same sample for LC-MS analysis.

Methods
Reagents
Human serum albumin (HSA), cytochrome C (bovine),
ovotransferrin (chicken), myoglobin (equine), and catalase (bovine)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), C3b from Complement
Technology, Inc. (Tyler, TX), creatine kinase (rabbit) from Roche
(Basel, Switzerland) and BS3 from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL).

Sample Preparation
Proteins were cross-linked separately
using a 1:1 weight-to-weight (w/w) cross-linker to protein ratio.
C3b buffer was exchanged using 30 kDa molecular weight cutoff (MWCO)
filters (Millipore, Cork, Ireland) into cross-linking buffer (20 mM
HEPES, 20 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.8). HSA, creatine kinase, myoglobin,
ovotransferrin, catalase, and cytochrome C were dissolved in cross-linking
buffer. Protein and cross-linker were mixed to a final concentration
of 1 mg/mL each. The mixture was incubated on ice for 2 h before the
reaction was stopped by ammonium bicarbonate (ABC, 50 mM final concentration).
Samples were dried in a vacuum concentrator and resuspended in 6 M
urea/2 M thiourea. Disulfide bonds were reduced by dithiothreitol
(DTT, 2.5 mM, 50 °C for 15 min) and alkylated by iodoacetamid
(IAA, 5 mM, RT for 30 min in the dark). The samples were diluted to
2 M urea using 50 mM ABC and digested with trypsin (50:1 protein to
enzyme w/w ratio, 37 °C, overnight). Digestions were stopped
by adding 10% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) until the pH was <2. Digests
were desalted using self-made C18 StageTips16 and peptides were eluted using 80% acetonitrile and 20%, 0.1% TFA
in water. Eluates were dried and resuspended in 0.1% TFA. The sample
referred to as the pseudocomplex was obtained by mixing resuspended
peptides from all proteins in 1:1 molar ratio. The injected amount
was 1 μg of peptides.

Data Acquisition
Samples were analyzed
using a UltiMate
3000 Nano LC system coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass
spectrometer equipped with an EasySpray Source (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
San Jose, CA). Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water,
mobile phase B of 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, and 19.9% water.
Peptides were loaded onto a 500 mm C-18 EasySpray column (75 μm
ID, 2 μm particles, 100 Å pore size) with 2% B at 300 nL/min
flow rate for 11 min and eluted at 300 nL/min flow rate with a linear
gradient from 2–40% B over 139 min.

Data-Dependent Acquisition
(DDA)
MS1 spectra were recorded
at resolution 120000 with a scan range from 400–1600 m/z with quadrupole isolation. The automated
gain control (AGC) target was set to 2 × 105, with
a max. injection time of 50 ms. The quadrupole was used for precursor
isolation with an isolation window of 1.4 m/z. Only precursors with charge states 3–8 with an
intensity higher than 5 × 104 were selected for fragmentation.
The monoisotopic precursor selection (MIPS) filter was activated.
MS2 spectra were recorded at 15000 resolution (AGC 5 × 104, 60 ms max. injection time). The option to inject ions for
all available parallelizable time was selected. Normalized collision
energies (NCEs) were set to the default values for each fragmentation
method. CID NCE was set to 35%. HCD NCE was set to 30%. Supplemental
activation (SA) NCE was set to 10% for ETciD, and 25% for EThcD. For
ETD, EThcD, and ETciD, charge-dependent reaction times were calibrated
with angiotensin.

Targeted Cross-Link m/z Species
Analysis
MS1 spectra were recorded at resolution 120000 and
ranging from 300 to 1700 m/z (AGC
2 × 105, max. injection time 50 ms). Only precursors
from the inclusion list with matching m/z (±5 ppm) and z during their specified retention
time windows were selected for fragmentation. Intensity threshold
was set to 5 × 104. MS2 spectra were recorded at 30000
resolution (AGC 5 × 104, 100 ms max. injection time).
If a target precursor was selected for fragmentation, a cycle of 42
consecutive MS2 spectra with different fragmentation parameters was
acquired (Table 1).
If the precursor was above the intensity threshold in the next MS1
spectrum, another cycle was acquired, yielding multiple spectra for
the same parameter set. The order of fragmentation parameters was
randomly shuffled and different for each of the three injection replicas.

Decision Tree Evaluation
MS1 spectra were recorded
at resolution 120’000 and ranging from 400 to 1600 m/z with quadropole isolation (AGC 2 ×
105, max. injection time 50 ms). MS2 spectra were recorded
at 30000 resolution (AGC 5 × 104, 60 ms max. injection
time).

Data Analysis
DDA
Raw files were preprocessed
with MaxQuant (v1.5.4.1),
using the partial processing until step 5. Resulting peak files (APL
format) were subjected to Xi,17 using the
following settings: MS accuracy, 6 ppm; MS/MS accuracy, 20 ppm; enzyme,
trypsin; max. missed cleavages, 4; max. number of modifications, 3;
fixed modification: carbamidomethylation on cysteine; variable modifications:
oxidation on Methionine; cross-linker: BS3 (mass modification: 109.0396
Da). Variable modifications of the cross-linker (“BS3-NH2”,
mass modification: 155.0946 Da; “BS3-OH”, 156.0786 Da)
and loop-links (“BS3-loop”, 138.0681 Da) were allowed.
BS3 was assumed to react with lysine, serine, threonine, tyrosine,
or the protein N-terminus. For CID/HCD, b- and y-type ions were included
in the search, for ETD c- and z-type ions, and for ETciD/EThcD b-,
c-, y-, and z-type ions.

The respective search databases consisted
of a single entry with the sequence of the corresponding protein,
that was extracted from the crystal structure PDB file (PDB IDs: 1AO6, 2CRK, 2FRJ). FDR was estimated
using XiFDR18 on 5% residue level with
enabled boosting and including only unique peptide-spectra matches
(PSMs). To further minimize false positives in the target list, links
with a distance >30 Å corresponding to the crystal structure
were excluded. All m/z species of
the remaining links were used to compile inclusion lists for the targeted
experiments. Retention time windows were calculated using iRT peptides
(Biognosys, Zürich, Switzerland) with a windows size of 10
min.

Targeted Cross-Link m/z Species
Analysis
Theoretical fragmentation spectra were generated
with a custom python script,19 considering
all possible c- and z-type ions for ETD, all b- and y-ions for HCD
and CID, or all b-, c-, y-, and z-ions for ETciD and EThcD fragmentation.
Raw files were first converted to mzML using MSconvert20 with enabled peak picking. MS2 spectra were
then matched to their corresponding m/z species from the inclusion list by the precursor m/z, charge, and retention time extracted from the
spectrum header. To determine the quality of the spectra, their peaks
were matched against the corresponding theoretical fragmentation spectrum
with a 20 ppm error margin. This provided the information needed to
calculate the sequence coverage as the ratio of the number of matched
fragments to the number of theoretical fragments. Note, sequence coverage
does not depend solely on the number of matched peaks but rather on
the number of observed n- or c-terminal peptide fragments.

Decision
Tree Evaluation
Preprocessing and Xi search
parameters were the same as for DDA. For the pseudocomplex sample
searches, a set of databases was used that comprised all proteins
in the mix plus either 0, 8, 24, 56, 120, or 248 random proteins from
the Mycoplasma pneumoniae proteome
(UP000000808). The initial optimized NCEs used for evaluation of the
decision trees deviate slightly from the final optimal NCEs (Table S3). For the pseudocomplex sample FDR was
estimated using 5% peptide pair level using XiFDR, combining intra-
and interlinks. As a consequence of the higher probability for false
interlinks, virtually all intralinks used here are true. For the ribosomal
sample, the search database comprised the most abundant 32, 64, 128,
256, or 512 proteins and a 5% residue level FDR was used.

The
mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange
Consortium via the PRIDE21 partner repository
with the data set identifier PXD006131.

Results and Discussion
We investigated five different fragmentation techniques available
on a tribrid mass spectrometer (CID, HCD, ETD, ETciD and EThcD) for
speed, sequence coverage and number of identified unique cross-linked
peptide pairs. Data were acquired using inclusion lists to ensure
that fragmentation spectra of comparable quality were obtained for
each precursor and fragmentation parameter combination. To populate
the inclusion lists with cross-linked targets, three model proteins
with known crystal structures (HSA, creatine kinase and myoglobin)
were cross-linked with BS3 and digested with trypsin, followed by
LC-MS analysis (Figure 1A). After applying a 5% link-level FDR and disregarding overlength
cross-links (>30 Å according to the crystal structures, Figure 1B), Each protein
was then analyzed using its respective inclusion list. Detecting a
cross-linked precursor from the inclusions list triggered 42 consecutive
MS2 events, each with a different fragmentation method - NCE combination
(Figure 1C). Each sample
was analyzed in triplicate but with randomly shuffled fragmentation
parameter order. A constant order could have resulted in a bias of
fragmentation spectra quality, linking some parameter sets systematically
to lower precursor intensities at the beginning or end of the chromatographic
elution peak. However, the influence of the order seemed to be low
and overall reproducibility good (HCD: Figure 1D; other techniques Figure
S1). For each m/z species,
the three best spectra (highest sequence coverage from each of the
three injection replicas) were used for further evaluation. In total,
1065 m/z species were detected in
all replicas and fragmented with a best sequence coverage of above
5% (Table S1).

HCD is Fastest
The number of MS2 spectra plays a crucial
role in maximizing the number of identifications. A shorter acquisition
time directly translates to more acquired spectra. To assess and compare
the speed of different fragmentation techniques, the acquisition time
from the targeted MS2 spectra was calculated by subtracting the retention
time of the previous spectrum from the current retention time. Data
from the three proteins each with three injection replicas were combined.
The results show that HCD is the fastest when acquiring fragmentation
spectra in the Orbitrap, with a median MS2 acquisition time of 12.3
ms, followed by CID with 15.3 ms, due to a longer ion path in the
instrument. The ETD methods take much more time because of the reaction
time that is allocated for the electron transfer reaction of the radical
fluoranthene anion with the precursor ions (ETD: 19.1 ms; EThcD: 19.4
ms; ETciD: 22.3 ms). This leads to 36–45% fewer spectra for
ETD related methods (Figure 2). This agrees with HCD yielding the highest number of spectra
in data-dependent acquisition.22,9

fragmentation methods when recording in the Orbitrap (Fusion Lumos).

DDDT for Cross-Linked Peptides
In addition to quantity,
quality of the acquired MS2 spectra is important for maximizing the
number of identifications. Better quality spectra (spectra with more
complete fragmentation and higher sequence coverage) lead to higher
scores compared to random matches. This results in a higher number
of identified PSMs at a given FDR. To assess the quality of fragmentation
independent from scoring algorithms that could be biased toward one
fragmentation method, spectral quality was evaluated by sequence coverage.
Sequence coverage was normalized to the highest averaged sequence
coverage for each precursor by any fragmentation technique.

Precursor m/z and charge state
effect the efficiency of fragmentation, as shown also by previous
studies.14,9,15 To design
a decision tree that optimizes sequence coverage, target m/z species were divided into m/z windows for each charge state. Minimal window size was
100 m/z, but was expanded in steps
of 100 m/z, to ensure that at least
five precursors were observed in the window at any NCE setting. For
the last m/z window of each charge
state this was relaxed to three precursors. Data of the best performing
NCE per method for each window is plotted in Figure 3A–E. Detailed plots for all NCEs can
be found in the Supporting Information (Figures S2–6). Note, HCD NCE shows a distinct maximum sequence
coverage between NCE 26–30%, while for the CID NCE it plateaus
above 22–24%. Once a threshold CID NCE is passed, the influence
of the NCE on the sequence coverage is small and the choice of “optimal”
NCE for CID appears to be affected by statistical variation. Similar
considerations can be made for EThcD and ETciD.

techniques depending on precursor m/z and charge. (A–E) Normalized
sequence coverage of the best performing NCE for each method and m/z window. Numbers next to the mean values
of the normalized sequence coverage indicate the respective best-performing
NCE values in %. Error bars represent the 0.95 CI. (F) Resulting DDDT
using the best fragmentation parameters from (A)–(E), for NCE
consult the respective panels.

The fragmentation efficiency of the three techniques that
make
use of ETD is highly dependent on charge-density. They perform better
for higher charge states, but their performance drops with increasing m/z. Not surprisingly, the supplemental
activation (SA) of the unreacted precursor ions (ETciD) or all ions
(EThcD) after ETD improves sequence coverage compared to ETD alone.
From the two SA methods, EThcD shows superior performance. HCD and
CID curves show a more stable behavior in performance over the entire m/z range and charge states, with HCD generally
outperforming CID. Overall HCD has consistently high performance over
all m/z windows that is only surpassed
for high charge-density precursors (z = 5+, 6+ for m/z < 800 and z = 7+
for all m/z), where EThcD seems
to be the method of choice.

The winning collision energy - fragmentation
technique combination
for every m/z window and charge
state were combined into a best sequence coverage (BSC) DDDT (Figure 3F). The only exception
being the charge 3+, 900–1100 m/z window where HCD instead of CID was chosen, since the sequence coverage
gain of CID appears to be within the error range and CID often favors
fragmentation of one peptide over the other in a cross-link.7 Our DDDT deviates from a previously proposed
DDDT for diazirine photo-cross-linked peptides9 by an increased role of HCD. As an important difference to previous
work, here we performed collision energy optimization, for example,
improving HCD performance by using lower collision energies (NCE 26–30%).
Additional contributing factors could be the different cross-linkers
used, the importance of link-site determination for the promiscuous
photo-cross-linker, and details in the experiment setup, e.g. here
parallel acquisition ensured comparable fragmentation spectra for
each method and precursor. We believe that the sequence coverage is
most likely a function of the cross-linked peptides and not the used
cross-linker (given that both are not gas-phase cleavable) and that
our here improved experiment design provided a more generally applicable
DDDT for not gas-phase cleavable cross-linkers.

We created four
additional DDDTs, one for each fragmentation method
with optimized NCEs. This was done to compare the performance of the
multimethod BSC DDDT with optimized single fragmentation methods.
ETD was excluded from further analysis due to its similarity to EThcD
and ETciD and its inferior performance.

Testing the DDDTs
To test the five DDDTs we used a
sample consisting of seven proteins, yielding eight database entries
(C3b comprises chain α and β), that were cross-linked
separately and then pooled together. We used this mixture as model
for a protein complex of medium size (sum of protein masses: ∼633
kDa). We hypothesized that, with increasing search space, better sequence
coverage of cross-linked peptides might be more important for the
number of identifications (passing a given FDR threshold) than the
sheer amount of acquired spectra. To simulate samples of different
complexity in silico, we added randomly selected proteins from the Mycoplasma pneumoniae proteome and ran searches with
sequence databases ranging from 8 (only pseudocomplex sequences) to
256 (8 pseudocomplex +248 M. pneumoniae sequences).

We find the term “cross-link” to
be used by various authors in very different ways, often referring
to PSMs, sometimes to peptides and rarely to residue pairs. We therefore
chose the following wordings: Unique cross-linked peptide pairs are
defined by their sequence and modifications (charge is not considered).
Residue pairs are defined by the sequence position of the residues
in the proteins sequence and this is unique by definition (unless
stated otherwise). We evaluated the number of identified intraprotein
cross-linked peptide pairs from the pseudocomplex proteins (plus interlinks
between C3b chain α and β) passing a 5% peptide pair level
FDR.

The actual FDR for these intraprotein cross-links is likely
much
smaller than 5% as the calculation of FDR included here the interprotein
cross-links and also all cross-links involving M. pneumoniae sequences.

Note that the score distribution of PSMs depended
on the acquisition
technique (Figure S8). This had to be considered
especially for the BSC DDDT. Score distribution differed mostly between
techniques producing different kinds and/or number of fragment ions,
possibly a consequence of the Xi scoring algorithm. Additionally,
the precursor mass distribution is altered due to the nature of the
decision tree, which also affects scoring. If the score distributions
differ noticeably, combination of the data before the FDR calculation
can lead to skewed results. Therefore, we combined data after separate
FDR estimation. This risks increasing the actual FDR as the number
of true matches can decrease due to redundancy while false matches
tend to be unique. Reassessing the FDR after data combination showed
that it did not rise above 5% for the BSC DDDT.

We used number
of cross-linked peptide pairs instead of residue
pairs as a benchmark for this sample. Using the peptide pair level
has the advantage that the data set used for FDR calculation is bigger
and therefore less prone to statistical variance. In general, more
identified unique peptide pairs translate to more unique residue pairs.

HCD is Favorable for Analyzing Small Complexes
HCD
gives the highest mean number of cross-linked peptide pairs over the
analyzed triplicates, with 147 for the noninflated search space decreasing
to 103 for the database consisting of 256 proteins (Figure 4A). The second best performing
method is the BSC DDDT (118 to 78). The three other methods perform
significantly worse. Compared to the worst performing method (ETciD)
choosing HCD results in a 2.6-fold increase in identified cross-linked
peptide pairs. The large loss of identified cross-linked peptide pairs
with increasing search database testifies the importance of limiting
the size of the search space.

HCD produced the largest average
number of MS2 spectra (49047)
(Figure 4B). The BSC
DDDT performed only slightly worse (47157, −3.8%), relying
mainly on HCD (90.5%). Looking at sequence coverage, the EThcD DDDT
gave best results, with a mean of 0.56. EThcD gave very complete fragmentation
for some cross-linked m/z species,
but lost in terms of speed and versatility, resulting in an overall
worse result of total number of identified cross-linked peptide pairs
(Figure 4A). The mean
sequence coverage of the BSC DDDT (0.48) is improved by ∼9%
compared to HCD (0.44), while still being able to record almost the
same amount of MS2 spectra (Figure 4C). Nevertheless, the improvement in sequence coverage
is apparently not significant enough to compensate for the loss in
raw number of total spectra. Not even the artificial increase in sample
complexity to 256 influences the advantage of HCD over the methods
that provide better sequence coverage. It seems like HCD with its
overall good sequence coverage and superior speed is the method of
choice when analyzing cross-links in samples with relatively low complexity.

We next analyzed the complementarity between the methods, to see
if it could be beneficial to use a combination of fragmentation methods
when injecting the sample more than once (Figure 4D). The best performing combination for two
injections is HCD-HCD (189 cross-linked peptide pairs), followed closely
by HCD-BSC (181). For the third additional injection the choice of
fragmentation method is secondary, as all methods perform very similar.
Due to simplicity we suggest choosing three times HCD (209).

The symmetry, a measurement of the absolute sequence coverage difference
between the better fragmented peptide (alpha) and the worse one (beta-peptide),9 is high for all methods apart from CID (Figure S7). This corroborates to previously published
work.7 Combined with the inferior sequence
coverage compared to HCD and its lower speed, CID fragmentation appears
to be second choice for the analysis of cross-linked peptides.

BSC DDDT
Improves Results for a High-Complexity Sample
Apart from
the pseudoprotein-complex sample, we tested the decision
trees on a sample with very high complexity. The combined ribosomal
fractions obtained by size exclusion chromatography of HEK 293 cell
lysate were used to test the methods in the analysis of a complex
mixture comprising about 1700 proteins. The search space size might
influence the number of identified cross-linked peptide pairs as a
trade-off exists between having all true targets in the sequence database
and adding noise in the form of false targets. Therefore, searches
were performed against an increasing number of the most abundant proteins
(Table S2). A total of 102 proteins were
observed at a dynamic range of 1:10 (based on iBAQ values), 383 proteins
at 1:100 (Figure S9).

The BSC DDDT
outperforms all other methods in all database sizes tested and gives
the highest mean number of cross-linked residue pairs with 165 in
the largest database search. BSC gives ∼21% more cross-linked
residue pairs than the second best method, HCD (averaged over all
search database sizes, Figure 5A). BSC DDDT and HCD yielded the same number of MS2 on this
sample (Figure 5B),
suggesting that the gain is not due to speed, but the impact of EThcD
(see discussion below). CID, ETciD, and EThcD are most affected by
increasing the sequence database. The number of identified cross-linked
residue pairs for these methods does not raise as much as for BSC
and HCD and even starts to decline from 256 to 512 sequences. This
further confirms their inferior role for samples of high complexity.
Choosing the BSC DDDT gives a 3.8-fold increase in number of identified
cross-linked residue pairs compared to the ETciD. The EThcD part of
the BSC DDDT boosts the sequence coverage distribution in comparison
to plain HCD which is reflected by the superior identification numbers
of the BSC DDDT (Figure 5C). EThcD shows the best sequence coverage distribution, but only
for a small number of identified cross-linked residue pairs, thereby
confirming its ability to provide high quality spectra only for specific
targets (those with high-charge density). When injecting the sample
two or three times the BSC DDDT provides the best results (232 and
280 cross-linked residue pairs, Figure 5D). Using the second-best additional method (HCD) instead
performs slightly worse (181 for BSC-HCD and 276 for BSC-BSC-HCD).

ribosomal sample. (A) Mean numbers of identified cross-linked residue
pairs passing a 5% residue level FDR over different search database
sizes (error bars represent the 0.95 CI). (B) Total number of acquired

The stacked bars in the BSC bar indicate the mean number of spectra
that were acquired with HCD (yellow, 95.2%) or EThcD (green, 4.8%).
(C) Sequence coverage comparison of the PSMs corresponding to the

the best method combinations for up to three injections of the same
sample. Mean numbers of identified cross-linked residue pairs passing
a 5% residue level FDR (error bars represent the 0.95 CI). Database
size is 512 sequences.

This means that the choice of best DDDT depends currently
on sample
complexity. In the complex sample in contrast to the lower complex
sample, HCD and BSC acquire almost an identical number of MS2 spectra.
We see the reason in the time-consuming EThcD fragmentation being
triggered less often in the complex sample (4.8% vs 9.5% in the pseudocomplex).
Fewer highly charged precursors were selected for fragmentation in
the complex sample (Figure S10A), explaining
the reduced proportion of EThcD events.

However, highly charged
precursors are also more likely to be cross-linked
peptides.7 So, one might expect better
results with more highly charge precursors being selected. This logic
is disrupted in the medium complexity of the pseudocomplex sample
by the high abundance of linear peptides with generally low competition
for acquisition time, leading to more highly charged linear precursors
being selected for (time-consuming) EThcD fragmentation (Figure S10B). Conversely in a high-complexity
sample, competition of eligible precursors for fragmentation disadvantages
these undesired species leading to an overall time gain for the BSC
DDDT method. The low abundance of cross-linked peptides compared to
linear peptides causes the low abundant linear peptide species with
higher charge states to influence the analysis of cross-links. Enrichable
cross-linkers23,24 could play an important role
in solving this problem and lead to a further gain of the BSC DDDT,
regardless of sample complexity.

Conclusion
HCD
is the method of choice for the majority of cross-linked peptides.
EThcD gives better sequence coverage for high charge-density peptides,
at the cost of longer acquisition times. CID, ETD, and ETciD all show
inferior performance. For samples with high complexity we propose
our optimized decision tree using a mixture of HCD and EThcD. For
samples of medium complexity, HCD alone is optimal, due to the time
that is wasted by EThcD on highly charged linear peptide species.
The choice of acquisition method plays a substantial role in maximizing
the number of identified cross-links.
