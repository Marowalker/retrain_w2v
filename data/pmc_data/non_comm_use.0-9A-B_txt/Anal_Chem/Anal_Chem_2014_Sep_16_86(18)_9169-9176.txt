We report on the performance of structures
for lossless ion manipulation
(SLIM) as a means for transmitting ions and performing ion mobility
separations (IMS). Ions were successfully transferred from an electrospray
ionization (ESI) source to the TOF MS analyzer by means of a linear
SLIM, demonstrating lossless ion transmission and an alternative arrangement
including a 90° turn. First, the linear geometry was optimized
for radial confinement by tuning RF on the central “rung”
electrodes and potentials on the DC-only guard electrodes. Selecting
an appropriate DC guard bias (2–6 V) and RF amplitude (≥160
Vp-p at 750 kHz) resulted in the greatest ion intensities.
Close to ideal IMS resolving power was maintained over a significant
range of applied voltages. Second, the 90° turn was optimized
for radial confinement by tuning RF on the rung electrodes and DC
on the guard electrodes. However, both resolving power and ion transmission
showed a dependence on these voltages, and the best conditions for
both were >300 Vp-p RF (685 kHz) and 7–11
V guard DC bias. Both geometries provide IMS resolving powers at the
theoretical limit (R ∼ 58), showing that degraded
resolution from a “racetrack” effect from turning around
a corner can be successfully avoided, and the capability also was
maintained for essentially lossless ion transmission.

==== Body
The introduction
of ion mobility
spectrometry/mass spectrometry (IMS/MS) and its commercial adaptations
have enabled a wide range of analytical capabilities including structural
measurements of macromolecules, including proteins1−15 and protein complexes,16−29 and separations of complex mixtures30−47 based upon both shape-to-charge (from IMS) and mass-to-charge (from
MS) ratios. IMS/MS offers additional advantages over conventional
MS. The most conceptually simple class of IMS devices utilize a uniform
weak DC electric field drift cell at pressures of less than 1 Torr
to atmospheric pressure for separation of ions. The drift velocity
in the background gas (N2, He, etc.) is directly proportional
to the ion mobility (K) and inversely proportional
to the collision cross section of the ion with the buffer gas.48 This allows direct measurement of collisional
cross sections by recording the arrival time distributions of the
analytes under study. Ignoring space charge effects,49 the resolving power of IMS in an ideal electric field is
mainly a function of two parameters: the initial gate opening time
at the ion source (t0), providing the
initial ion distribution, and the peak broadening effects due to diffusion
as the ions travel through the device.50 Resolving power is typically measured by the quotient of the arrival
time divided by the peak width at half-maximum.51 The resolving power is given by the following equation.50,51 1  T refers to drift cell temperature, q is charge of the ion, L is drift cell
length, E is the electric field, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. Under conditions where the
initial ion packet pulse width (t0) is
negligible, the resolving power increases with the electric field,
and eq 1 simplifies to eq 2, the diffusion limited expression for IMS resolving power (Rd). 2  

Under these conditions, the ion drift time does not affect
the
resolving power, and the resolving power increases proportionately
with the square root of L and E.
Eventually, the increase in electric field causes an increase in ion
velocity to the point that the effects of diffusion on peak width
become negligible, and the resolving power potentially achievable
for an initial ion pulse (Rp) is defined
by eq 3 3  where v is the ion velocity.
Under these conditions, the resolving power decreases with the reciprocal
of electric field but increases linearly with drift length. Both Rd and Rp increase
with increasing drift length, driving efforts to extend the drift
cell length to increase resolving power.52,53 A key challenge, however, is the loss of sensitivity due to radial
diffusion of the ions and, for example, Coulombic repulsion, into
the electrode surfaces or other surfaces present in the system.49,54

Several approaches have been introduced for increasing the
sensitivity
of IMS/MS measurements. One was the implementation of the electrodynamic
ion funnel after IMS analysis.55 The ion
funnel allowed lossless ion transfer through a two meter drift tube
coupled to a QTOF, avoiding large losses at the IMS/MS interface by
recompressing the ion beam after radial diffusion before entry into
the MS interface without loss of IMS resolving power. Additionally,
instead of using a Bradbury–Nielson gate56 to pulse ions into the IMS, ion funnels with accumulation
and gating regions55 as well as an ion
funnel trap57 were introduced to provide
greater ion signals without sacrificing IMS resolving power. Another
approach to increasing IMS/MS sensitivity was applying alternating
phase RF voltage to adjacent IMS drift rings to counteract diffusive
and space charge-induced ion loss by providing radial RF confinement.58,59 These approaches have increasingly driven the use of IMS/MS commercial
instruments for biological analyses and analytical separations.

We have recently introduced structures for lossless ion manipulations
(SLIM) to provide a basis for complex gas phase ion manipulations.60 SLIM utilize RF ion confinement in conjunction
with DC potentials to manipulate ions in multiple dimensions with
initial implementations that aim to enable steps that include lossless
ion transport, trapping, turning, and switching between alternative
paths. In contrast to conventional constant field drift tube and traveling
wave61 devices, SLIM devices can potentially
be readily assembled into many alternative arrangements. Here, we
demonstrate this ability by evaluating two of the basic building blocks
needed to enable complex manipulations, i.e., the linear and 90°
turn segments. Using printed circuit board (PCB)-based SLIM devices
allows for a multitude of electrode designs to be rapidly fabricated,
tested, and applied at low cost based on the results of ion trajectory
and potential calculations. The designs for these sets of experiments
were chosen due to their lossless performance and highly efficient
IMS separations in simulations at pressures of 4 Torr.62,63 However, SLIM devices are not fundamentally limited to IMS experiments
or even ∼4 Torr pressure environments. We aim to utilize these
devices in the future to allow for series of ion manipulations of
biologically relevant macromolecules and complex mixtures currently
unattainable by state-of-the-art instrumentation.

In this work,
we show initial results of the lossless nature of
the device with ion current measurements. In addition, the effects
of radial confinement and electric field on ion transmission and IMS
resolving power for SLIM consisting of linear and 90° turn SLIM
components are presented. The IMS resolving power and intensity are
also compared between a linear SLIM arrangement and an arrangement
including the 90° turn. The combination of lossless ion transfer
with the ability to turn and store ions allows for an extremely flexible
foundation for the development of more complex SLIM devices.

Experimental
Arrangement
SLIM
SLIM were fabricated from 7.62 cm × 7.62
cm component segments composed of FR-4 material (fiber glass cloth
with epoxy resin) with copper electrodes laid directly onto the PCB
(Figure 1A). RF rung electrodes are 0.76 mm
wide × 5.33 mm long, spaced 0.76 mm from each other (edge to
edge), and thus 1.52 mm center-to-center. The RF applied to each electrode
is 180° out of phase with respect to adjacent electrodes in the Z coordinate (Figure 1B). The RF
potentials create a repulsive pseudopotential in the Y coordinate for ions close to the electrodes.62,63 A superimposed DC potential gradient was also established to enable
directed ion motion in the Z coordinate. DC-only
“guard” electrodes, 5.25 mm wide × 6 mm long, provided
a lateral barrier in the X coordinate to prevent
ions from being lost to the sides. Guards were typically biased 2–15
V higher than the DC on the first neighboring RF electrode. Guard
electrodes were biased by applying a potential gradient from the first
to last guard via resistive chain. Each SLIM board was spaced 4.76
mm from an identical electrode arrangement on a parallel board (Figure 1B). This provides for an equivalent pseudopotential
well both above and below the center of the ion path (Y coordinate) and for effectively lossless ion transmission.

Mass Spectrometry
Ions from an Agilent low concentration
ESI tuning mix (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and a 1 μM nine peptide
mix (bradykinin acetate salt, kemptide acetate salt, angiotensin I
human acetate salt hydrate, angiotensin II human, neurotensin, renin
substrate tetradecapeptide porcine, substance P acetate salt hydrate,
melittin from honey bee venom, and fibrinopeptide A human (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) in 50/50/1 vol/vol/vol water/methanol/acetic acid (Fisher
Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA)) were generated by nanoelectrospray ionization
using etched emitters and infusion by syringe pump (Chemyx, Stafford,
TX) with a flow rate of 0.3 μL/min and introduced into the first
stage of vacuum through a stainless steel 250 μm i.d. capillary
heated to 120 °C (Figure 2). After exiting
the heated capillary, ions enter an ion funnel trap64−66 (3.95 Torr)
for ion accumulation and pulsed gating into the SLIM for IMS. The
exit gate was opened for a 0.162 ms pulse for all Agilent tune mix
experiments. Upon exiting the trapping region of the funnel, ions
traverse a 2.54 cm long convergent region of the ion funnel and are
injected through a 2.5 mm diameter conductance limiting orifice into
the SLIM (4 Torr). The 50 mTorr positive pressure prevents neutrals
from entering the SLIM. After drifting through the SLIM, ions exit
via a rear ion funnel (15 cm length). The potentials in the convergent
region of the ion funnel trap, SLIM, and rear ion funnel are set to
maintain a constant electric field through the entire region. Ions
then pass through a conductance-limiting orifice into a short RF-only
quadrupole to the differentially pumped region (475 mTorr) of an Agilent
6224 TOF MS with a 1.5 m flight tube (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA). Data was processed with a U1084A 8-bit ADC digitizer (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) using in-house control software.

Torr. The SLIM region is at 4.00 Torr. The short quadrupole is at

Results and Discussion
Ion Current
Measurements To Investigate “Lossless”
Ion Transmission
The total ion current resulting from ESI
of the Agilent tuning mix and ions injected to a SLIM linear module
was directly measured as a function of position along the ion path.
The ion current was measured by a Keithley 6485 picoammeter (Keithley
Instruments, Inc., Cleveland, OH) connected to a coaxial cable with
the shield on the opposite end of the cable grounded to the vacuum
chamber and an exposed “probe” section of wire positioned
between the two parallel SLIM surfaces for a module composed of four
sets of parallel linear segments. The measurements were conducted
by repeatedly physically repositioning the probe at 6.93, 16.1, 29.3,
and 37.5 cm from the entrance to the SLIM module, with the last measurement
being made in the ion funnel after the SLIM module. The electric field
used was 5 V/cm due to electric discharge between the electrodes and
the bare wire probe at higher voltages. Figure 3 gives the measured ion currents, 245, 230, 215, and 235 pA for each
position, and shows lossless ion transmission through the device within
experimental error (displayed as error bars calculated from the standard
deviation of the triplicate measurements).

current measured as a function of distance

deviations from triplicate measurements. Measurements were made by
inserting a probe in between the two planar electrodes at each point.

Optimization of RF Amplitude
and DC Guard Biases for the Linear
SLIM Module
The effects of RF amplitude and DC guard biases
on the intensities and IMS resolving power were initially measured
for a linear-only SLIM module consisting of six parallel pairs of
straight segments (total length of 45.7 cm) and an overall drift region
of 63.2 cm (including the converging section of the front funnel trap
and the rear ion funnel). The length was increased by two segments
to increase the resolving power (eq 1). Intensities
were normalized to the most intense m/z 922 peak in each study. The first experimental parameter studied
was RF amplitude. The RF pseudopotential wells can be modeled for
an ion guide such as the present SLIM module by the approximation
of a series of infinite line conductors with alternating polarity
potentials.67,68 As with ion funnels, the RF potentials
give the following effective confining potential 4  VRF is the 0-peak RF amplitude, h is the
perpendicular
coordinate to the infinite wires, d is the space
between adjacent wires (RF electrodes for the SLIM), q is the ion charge, m is ion mass, and f is the applied RF frequency. How well ions are confined is thus
inversely proportional to m/z and
directly proportional to the square of RF amplitude. For example,
when RF was increased from 80 Vp-p to 100 Vp-p, there is an increase in the pseudopotential well
depth by a factor of 1.56. With sufficient RF amplitude, it is expected
that increases in pseudopotential well depth do not cause an increase
in ion signal as ions are no longer lost due to poor RF confinement.
The effects of a 750 kHz RF waveform amplitude on the relative intensity
and resolving power for m/z 922
are shown in Figure 4A. Ion intensity was measured
and normalized to the maximum intensity observed, and found to increase
with RF amplitude until reaching 160 Vp-p, after
which the ion signal intensity plateaued. Therefore, the pseudopotential
wells generated by RF were deep enough to allow for stable ion trajectories.

Figure 4 (A) Effects
of RF amplitude on relative intensity (inverted black
triangles) and resolving power (blue squares) for m/z 922 in the linear arrangement. The guard bias
was set to 5 V above the first and last RF electrode. The RF frequency
was 750 kHZ. (B) Effects of guard bias voltage on relative intensity
(black inverted triangles) and IMS resolving power (blue squares).
The guard bias was set to the desired voltage the same magnitude above
the first and the last RF trace. RF was 750 kHz, 220 Vp-p.

Next, the effect of RF amplitude
on the resolving power was evaluated.
Calculations of the RF pseudo potential wells showed regions of high
local RF potentials in the YZ plane close to the surface of the RF
electrodes.62,63 Therefore, the motion of ions
that are not properly confined to the center of the device (i.e.,
in the RF field-free region) may be perturbed resulting in IMS peak
broadening. Across all RF amplitudes used, the IMS resolving power
remained fairly constant, with a mean resolving power of 43. This
indicates that as the RF amplitude was increased, the local RF fields
experienced by the ions never became high enough to cause a decrease
in resolving power due to peak broadening or tailing. The RF amplitude
was increased to 320 Vp-p to ascertain whether RF
fields would begin to slow ions, but Figure 4A illustrates that the resolving power did not change with the current
SLIM configuration, which is important for operating SLIM for ion
mobility measurements. Because resolving power itself did not change,
the center of the arrival time distributions for m/z were considered as well (Table 1A). The standard deviation of the peak centroid was 0.22 ms,
while the TOF pusher pulse period was 0.16 ms, again indicating little
variability in arrival time as a function of RF amplitude.

a In both cases,
arrival time resolution
is 0.16 ms.

Next, the effects
of the guard DC bias relative to the rung electrodes
on both intensity and resolving power were explored using 750 kHz,
220 Vp-p RF (Figure 4B).
The chosen guard bias did not significantly alter the IMS resolving
power except when the guards were biased 1 V above the DC of the RF
electrodes, where the resolving power dropped to ∼39 due to
the low intensity (and poorly defined IMS peaks). For higher selected
guard biases, the mean resolving power was 43 (standard deviation
0.6); the arrival time distribution centroids for m/z 922 are given in Table 1B. As with RF amplitude, changing the guard biases does not significantly
change the arrival time distribution (0.08 ms standard deviation of
the arrival times; less than the time resolution limitation defined
by the TOF pusher pulse). In contrast to RF amplitude, there is range
of guard biases that optimize ion transmission; for the linear SLIM
device, the range was from ∼2 to 6 V. Again, intensities were
normalized to the highest intensity of m/z 922 observed
in the study. The decrease in signal below 2 V is attributed to ineffective
ion confinement (i.e., losses to the sides of the RF electrodes).
Biases greater than ∼6 V cause ion losses, most likely by unoptimized
fields at the entrance and exits of the SLIM. A nested IMS/MS spectrum
of the nine peptide mix recorded with the optimized values for RF
and DC guards illustrates the ability of the SLIM device to perform
IMS separations on a mixture (Figure 2, Supporting
Information).

Optimization of RF Amplitude and DC Guard
Bias for a SLIM Module
Including a 90° Turn
The development of practical SLIM
modules for extensive ion manipulations, for example, high-resolution
IMS with extended path lengths, generally depends upon the ability
to turn ions (by, for example, 90°). Turning ions allows for
transmitting ions into different SLIM regions for different types
of manipulations, for example, trapping, separations, and reactions,
while keeping the SLIM device itself within a modest footprint and
allowing for more compact and flexible designs. The design philosophy
applied with our SLIM is to exploit the rapid collisional ion damping
to make turns abruptly and thus eliminate or minimize any “racetrack
effect”, resulting in broadening of IMS peaks due to ions of
the same mobility taking paths of multiple different lengths as well
as experiencing different field gradients through the turn. In our
experimental studies, the fourth linear section was replaced with
a segment allowing a 90° turn (Figure 5A). The potentials were assigned such that the ions are swept into
a potential established from the beginning of one side of the bottom
of the “tee” segment to the end of the device (Figure
3, Supporting Information). The effective
drift fields experienced by the ions can therefore be made constant
through the turning region. In the direction opposite that of the
ion motion, the drift potential creates an effective DC barrier, preventing
ions from “leaking” in the opposite direction. Simulations
predict lossless ion transmission when the 90° turn is operated
in this mode (Figure 1B, Supporting Information). The ion source was moved orthogonal to the TOF instrument axis
to allow for the use of only a single turn segment. However, due to
engineering constraints of the vacuum housing, the SLIM arrangement
with a 90° turn is longer than the linear arrangement used above
by 3.05 cm. Because R is proportional to the square
root of the length, the effect of the additional length does not significantly
alter the resolving power (at most ∼3% higher for m/z 922 using turn geometry).

Figure 5 Illustration of the 90°
turn segment. (A) Ions enter the turn
and continue in the direction of voltage drop. The voltage remains
constant throughout the turn. (B) Illustration of RF phasing through
the turning region.

The trend for relative
intensity (normalized to the highest value)
is similar to the straight-only SLIM arrangement shown in Figure 5B, with ion transmission optimized for guard bias
from ∼7 to 12 V (Figure 6A). Transmission
decreases significantly for guard bias >13 V. The shape of the
guard
DC bias versus intensity curve can be attributed to poor lateral ion
confinement at low DC bias voltages and ion losses to the RF electrodes
at high guard DC bias due to excessive field penetration from the
guards, pushing ions toward the RF electrodes. DC fields generated
by the guard electrodes have an orthogonal component that affects
the overall confinement potential in the orthogonal dimension (toward
the electrode surfaces).62,63 When the local field
is stronger than the field for drift motion (i.e., ≥20 V/cm
for the present SLIM design), the ions can be lost to electrode surfaces.
However, the lowest effective guard bias increases from 2 V for the
linear geometry to 7 V for the geometry including a turn. This difference
is attributed to poor lateral ion confinement by the guards for the
turn segment with <7 V biases.

Figure 6 (A) Effects of guard DC bias voltage on
the relative intensity
(black inverted triangles) and resolving power (blue squares) for m/z 922. The RF frequency was 685 kHz and
amplitude was 320 Vp-p. Intensities are normalized
to m/z 922 intensity at a guard
bias of 11 V. (B) Effects of RF amplitude on relative intensity (black
inverted triangles) and resolving power (blue squares) for m/z 922. The guard bias used was 11 V and
RF frequency was 685 kHz. Intensities are normalized to m/z 922 intensity at 320 Vp-p RF.

The effects of RF amplitude on
signal intensity and IMS resolving
power for m/z 922 are shown in Figure 6B. The guard bias used was 11 V for an electric
field of 20 V/cm, similar to the linear-only arrangement. The same
trend for RF amplitude and signal intensity was observed for the 90°
turn and linear arrangements, where the signal increases with RF amplitude
to a plateau in ion intensity once a deep enough potential well is
reached providing sufficient RF ion confinement. However, the RF amplitudes
used are approximately a factor of 2 higher than for the linear arrangement.
Unlike the linear geometry, where each adjacent electrode had an opposing
phase RF applied, the present SLIM design has adjacent electrodes
with the same phase of RF in the turning region of the 90° turn
segment (Figure 5B). Employing adjacent electrodes
with the same phase of RF results in a decrease in the local pseudopotential
well. As a result (along with the effects of field penetration from
using 11 V biases on the DC guards), ion trajectory simulations show
only 12% ion transmission through the turning region when using 160
Vp-p (viz., optimized RF amplitude for the linear
path) (Figure 1A, Supporting Information). Increasing the RF amplitude by a factor of 2 with the present
design mitigates the loss of ions due to adjacent electrodes with
the same phases of RF. This increases the pseudopotential (∼4-fold,
and 4.8-fold if accounting for the somewhat lower RF frequency used;
eq 4), with simulations showing 100% transmission
through the turn at 320 Vp-p (Figure 1B, Supporting Information).

Ion trajectory
simulations have shown that close to the rung electrodes
the RF fields actually act as barriers to drift motion (vide supra).62,63 For the highest IMS resolving power, the ions must remain in the
RF field-free regions (viz., near the center of the device) to avoid
perturbation to ion trajectories. The DC field penetration form the
higher guard biases used for lateral confinement in the 90° turn
arrangement pushes the ions toward the electrodes. The resolving power
increases as RF amplitude increases, from 35 at 260 Vp-p to 42 at 320 Vp-p, in contrast to the linear arrangement
where resolving power remains fairly constant with RF amplitude. Increasing
the RF amplitude increases the resolving power by keeping the ions
confined in the RF field-free center region of the device, balancing
the effects from DC field penetration by the guard electrodes. The
center of the arrival time distributions and their full width half-maxima
(fwhm) are recorded in Table 2. The ion arrival
times decrease with increasing RF, and the fwhm of the distributions
decrease with increasing RF, attributed to a reduction of the effects
of axial trapping on ion motion. After optimizing the RF amplitude
for resolving power (i.e., 320 Vp-p), the effects
of the guard bias on IMS resolving power were measured (Figure 6A). With the RF optimized, the resolving power remained
relatively constant with increasing guard DC bias, not increasing
as it did for the lower RF amplitude.

Optimization
of Electric Field for IMS Resolving Power for Straight
and Turn Arrangements
The effects of the electric field on
IMS resolving power for both the linear and 90° turn arrangements
are shown in Figure 7 for m/z 1222. Electric fields of 14–20 V/cm were
used to compare the resolving power between the straight-only and
the turn geometry. Error bars are calculated as ± one standard
deviation in resolving power from the mean of three trials for each
electric field. The IMS resolving power, assuming ideal IMS, for each
electric field was also calculated using eq 1 and is included in Figure 7. The straight-only
configuration shows that the resolving power increases from 54 to
57 as the electric field is increased from 14 to 20 V/cm. The results
are in excellent agreement with eq 1, indicating
that the linear geometry behaves as an ideal drift tube. The configuration
including the 90° turn does not show an upward trend but instead
shows a decreasing trend from 18 to 20 V/cm. Overall, the comparison
of the resolving power for the two geometries indicates that any difference
between configurations is minor once guard bias voltage and RF amplitude
have been optimized.

Figure 7 Effects of electric field strength on IMS resolving power
for the
linear and 90° turn geometries (turn segment substituted for
the linear segment). For the linear geometry, the RF was 750 kHz,
220 Vp-p with guard DC bias of 5 V. For the turn
geometry, the RF was 685 kHz, 320 Vp-p with guard
DC bias of 11 V. Theory data points were calculated using eq 1.

Conclusions
Two
implementations of structures for lossless ion manipulations
have been initially explored, including a linear geometry that was
optimized for ion mobility resolving power and ion transmission. The
two key parameters studied were DC bias of the guard electrodes and
the amplitude of RF applied to the RF electrodes. The IMS resolving
power was shown to be independent of RF amplitude or guard electrode
potential. However, ion transmission was dependent on the RF amplitude,
increasing with increasing amplitude until optimized, similar to the
behavior observed and predicted by equipotential modeling for the
ion funnel.69 Ion transmission also depended
on the guard DC bias, with reduced ion confinement at low bias and
“choking” due to field penetration at high bias. Once
optimized at 220 Vp-p RF and a 5 V guard bias, the
measured resolving power was similar to the theoretical resolving
power for an ideal drift tube for electric fields 14–20 V/cm.50,51

The second SLIM arrangement explored included a 90° turn
component.
As with the linear geometry, this arrangement displayed increasing
ion transmission with increasing RF amplitude until fully effective.
RF amplitudes used with the present SLIM design were ∼2-fold
higher as compared to the linear arrangement and were attributed to
the need to ameliorate the effects of guard DC field penetration into
the ion path. The resulting resolving power and transmission efficiency
for ions traveling through the turn and linear arrangements were comparable,
indicating lossless IMS/MS can be achieved even when ions are turned
orthogonally from their initial drift direction. This work demonstrates
key building blocks for assembly of larger and more complex arrangements
and supports the feasibility of SLIM designs that allow extended ion
manipulations including higher resolution ion mobility separations.
