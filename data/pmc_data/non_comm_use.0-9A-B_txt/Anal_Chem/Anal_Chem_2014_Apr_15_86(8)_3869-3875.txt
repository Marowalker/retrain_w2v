DNA–protein
conjugates are very useful in analytical chemistry for target recognition
and signal amplification. While a number of methods for conjugating
DNA with proteins are known, methods for purification of DNA–protein
conjugates from reaction mixture containing unreacted proteins are
much less investigated. In this work, a simple and efficient approach
to purify DNA–invertase conjugates from reaction mixture via
a biotin displacement strategy to release desthiobiotinylated DNA–invertase
conjugates from streptavidin-coated magnetic beads was developed.
The conjugates purified by this approach were utilized for quantitative
detection of cocaine and DNA using a personal glucose meter through
structure-switching DNA aptamer sensors and competitive DNA hybridization
assays, respectively. In both cases, the purified DNA–invertase
conjugates showed better performance compared to the same assays using
unpurified conjugates. The approach demonstrated here can be further
expanded to other DNA and proteins to generate purified DNA–protein
conjugates for analytical and other applications.

DNA molecules
have been widely used in analytical chemistry as an excellent class
of recognition moiety for selective detection of many target substances.1 The targets include not only complementary DNA
or RNA through nucleic acid hybridization,2 but also metal ions, organic molecules, proteins and even cells,
through functional DNAs that are capable of either catalyzing reactions
(DNAzymes),3−8 binding target molecules (DNA aptamers),9−16 or both (DNA aptazymes).17−19 Functional DNAs are obtained
via a combinatorial technique known as in vitro selection or systematic
evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX),3,20,21 and have been found to recognize
a variety of analytes with high specificity and affinity.22−24 By using DNAs labeled with suitable signal reporters as sensors,
a series of analytical techniques, such as fluorescence,15,25−31 colorimetry,32−37 electrochemistry,14,38−42 flow cytometry,43−45 magnetic resonance,46,47 and surface enhanced Raman scattering48−50 have been successfully
applied for the detection with high sensitivity and selectivity.

Given the high selectivity of these DNA molecules, it is desirable
to combine them with the functional versatility of proteins.51,52 Such DNA–protein conjugates would find a broad range of applications,53−61 including more sensitive detection via signal amplification and
more diverse signal output via various enzymatic reactions.62 For example, DNA was conjugated with lipase
for nucleic acid hybridization assays by forming sandwich complex
with surface-immobilized DNA sensors,63 where each target nucleic acid molecule induced the binding of one
DNA–enzyme conjugate on the surface to produce many product
molecules for signal amplification. Two split cocaine aptamer fragments
were also conjugated with a pair of cascade enzymes,55 respectively, to enable target-induced structure changes
of the DNA–enzyme conjugates, which then brought the two enzymes
closer and enhanced the cascade reactions for sensitive detection.

A functional DNA–invertase conjugation approach also played
a key role in converting the widely available personal glucose meters
(PGM) into a more versatile device to detect a broad range of nonglucose
targets.64−71 PGM is currently the most successful and widely used personal diagnosis
device,72−74 but its usage was limited in blood glucose monitoring
for diabetes until the invertase-based approach was established.64−71 The advantages of using PGM for detecting targets beyond glucose
include simplicity, low cost, portability and wide availability. The
mechanism of the detection was based on the target-induced release
or binding of DNA–invertase conjugates from the surface of
magnetic beads for target recognition, and the invertase-catalyzed
hydrolysis of sucrose into glucose for PGM measurement.64−67,70,71 The approach enabled PGMs to detect many targets such as toxins
and disease biomarkers for environmental monitoring and medical diagnosis
by the general public. Besides analytical applications, DNA–protein
conjugates have also been widely utilized to construct nanoassemblies
with various functions. The covalent attachment of DNA to streptavidin
with four native binding sites for biotin allowed them to serve as
selective connectors in the DNA-directed self-assembly of proteins.75 Photoresponsible DNA-HRP/GOx conjugates were
also constructed and characterized by means of colorimetric signal
change.58 To realize the full potentials
of these important applications, efficient methods to prepare the
DNA–protein conjugates are required.

To prepare DNA–protein
conjugates, both covalent approach, such as chemical reaction through
functional groups on the biomolecules,76 and noncovalent approach, such as through biotin–streptavidin
and metal–histidine tag interactions77 have been developed. For most approaches, the conjugation between
a large DNA and a large protein molecule often results in a moderate
yield. As a result, considerable amounts of unconjugated DNAs and
proteins are still present in the reaction mixture containing the
DNA–protein conjugate products.51 To avoid interference from the starting materials, the conjugate
products are required to be purified from the reaction mixtures using
methods such as chromatography and electrophoresis.61,77 However, it is usually time-consuming to use chromatography to achieve
fine separation of conjugation products in high yield, and electrophoresis
under nondenaturing condition to preserve the native structure and
activity of the proteins is also laborious and the recovery of conjugation
products from electrophoresis gels often resulted in low yields. In
this work, we report a simple and efficient method to separate conjugation
product from the starting materials, by developing an on-bead biotin
displacement method based on the much stronger affinity of biotin
to streptavidin than a biotin analog called d-desthiobiotin.
The purified conjugates using this method were shown to display enhanced
analytical performance over the unpurified conjugates in sensing applications.

meter was used for the tests. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (mean
diameter 1.5 μm) and Amicon centrifugal filters (10 kDa and
100 kDa molecular weight cutoff) were purchased from Bangs Laboratories
Inc. (Fishers, IN) and Millipore Inc. (Billerica, MA), respectively.

The buffer used in this work (buffer A) was composed of 0.1 M NaCl,
0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 0.05% Tween-20 (Tween-20 was
added as a surfactant to reduce the nonspecific binding of biomolecules
to magnetic beads, and also to prevent the magnetic beads from sticking
to the inner wall of microtubes).

Desthiobiotin–DNA
Conjugation
A mixture of 3.8 mg of desthiobiotin, 7.6 mg
of EDC, and 7.6 mg of sulfo-NHS was added to 100 μL of DMF.
This mixture was kept at room temperature for 2 h. Then 80 μL
of 500 μM 5-thiol-3-amine-modified DNA containing a 5′
thiol (originally as a disulfide modification as shown in Figure 1a and then reduced by TCEP to generate active thiol
for later conjugation) and a 3′ amine, 20 μL of 1 M NaHCO3–Na2CO3 buffer at pH 8.7 were
added to the DMF solution. The resulting solution was kept at room
temperature for overnight. Then purified by Amicon-10 K using Millipore
water by 8 times.

Desthiobiotinylated DNA–Invertase
Conjugation
The procedure was according to the method reported
in our previous work with some minor modifications.64 Briefly, 30 μL of 1 mM desthiobiotin–DNA,
2 μL of 1 M sodium phosphate buffer at pH 5.5, and 2 μL
of 30 mM TCEP were mixed, the solution was placed on a shaker for
1 h at room temperature. Then purified by Amicon-10 K using buffer
A without Tween-20 by 8 times. In addition, 1 mg of sulfo-SMCC was
mixed with 400 μL of 20 mg/mL invertase in buffer A without
Tween-20. After vortexing, the solution was kept at room temperature
for 1 h. Then the mixture was centrifuged to remove the insoluble
excess sulfo-SMCC. The supernatant was purified for 8 times by Amicon-100
K using buffer A without Tween-20. The above solution of desthiobiotinylated
DNA-SH was mixed with sulfo-SMCC activated invertase. The resulting
solution was kept at room temperature for 48 h. Then it was purified
by Amicon-100 K using buffer A without Tween-20 by 8 times.

Procedures
for Cocaine Detection Using PGM
Sensor Preparation
One milliliter of 1 mg/mL streptavidin-coated magnetic beads was
first washed using buffer A twice by a magnetic rack and then dispersed
in buffer A. Twelve microliters of 0.5 mM biotin-DNA1 and 12 μL
of 0.5 mM cocaine aptamer were added to the MBs solution and mixed
for 30 min at room temperature. After that, it was washed three times
using buffer A to remove excess biotin-DNA1 and cocaine aptamer. Purified
DNA–invertase conjugates (about 20 mg/mL) was added to the
MBs solution and well mixed for 30 min at room temperature. After
that, the MBs were separated from the solution by the magnetic rack,
and excess purified DNA–invertase conjugates were washed off
by buffer A three times. Then separated as each portion of 60 μL
1 mg/mL MBs in buffer A.

Cocaine Detection via the Structure−Switching
Assay
Twenty microliters of various concentration of target
cocaine in buffer A was added to each portion of the above MBs and
well mixed for 15 min. Then the solution was separated using a magnetic
rack. Ten microliters of the clear solution was mixed with 10 μL
of 1 M sucrose in buffer A. After it stood at room temperature for
15 min, 5 μL of the final solution was tested by a commercially
available PGM.

Procedures for Competitive DNA Detection
Using PGM
Sensor Preparation
One milliliter
of 1 mg/mL streptavidin-coated magnetic beads was buffer exchanged
to buffer A twice by a magnetic rack and finally resuspended in buffer
A. Fifty microliters of 100 μM biotin-DNA2 was added to the
solution, and the mixture was placed on a roller for 30 min at room
temperature. After that, the MBs were washed three times using buffer
A containing 1 mM biotin to remove unbound biotin-DNA2 and block nonspecific
binding sites by biotin. Then, they were separated into portions containing
20 μL of 1 mg/mL MBs in buffer A.

DNA Detection via the Competitive
Assay
Each portion of the above MBs was separated by a magnetic
rack, and the residual MBs were used as the sensor for tests. Ten
microliters of the DNA sample of various concentrations in buffer
A was mixed with 10 μL of 40 nM purified DNA–invertase
conjugates. This was then added to the MBs, and the mixture was mixed
on a roller for 2 h at room temperature. After magnetic separation,
a 10 μL of 1 M sucrose in buffer A was added to the supernatant.
Finally, 5 μL of the solution was tested by a PGM after 1 h.

Design and Demonstration of Biotin Displacement Method for Purification
of DNA–Protein Conjugates
The method developed in
this study relies on the different dissociation constants between
biotin–streptavidin (Kd = 1.3 ×
10−15 M at pH 5.0) and desthiobiotin–streptavidin
(Kd = 9 × 10−13 M for d-desthiobiotin and Kd = 6 × 10−11 M for l-desthiobiotin
at pH 4.0).78 The much stronger binding
affinity of streptavidin toward biotin over desthiobiotin suggests
desthiobiotin-labeled conjugates can be efficiently displaced by biotin
and released from streptavidin, as shown in Figure 1. To a DNA strand modified with an amine at 3′ end
and a thiol (as disulfide) at 5′ end, desthiobiotin was covalently
attached to the 3′ amine of the DNA through the EDC/sulfo-NHS
condensation (Figure 1a). The production of
desthiobiotinylated DNA with almost 100% modification yield was confirmed
by the result from matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight
mass spectrum (MALDI-TOF MS, see Figure S1 in Supporting Information).
Subsequently, the 5′ thiol of the desthiobiotinylated DNA was
activated using TECP, and invertase was functionalized through its
surface amines by a commercial cross-linker, Sulfo-SMCC. Finally,
the desthiobiotinylated DNA containing reactive thiols and Sulfo-SMCC-activated
invertase were conjugated via the maleimide–thiol reaction
to yield the desthiobiotinylated DNA–invertase conjugates (Figure 1a). After removing unconjugated desthiobiotinylated
DNA (<12 kDa) by a centrifuge filter membrane with 100 kDa molecular
weight cutoff, the resulting solution containing desthiobiotinylated
DNA–invertase conjugates and unreacted invertase (both >100
kDa) was treated with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (MBs) to
immobilize desthiobiotinylated DNA–invertase conjugates through
desthiobiotin–streptavidin binding (Figure 1b). The unreacted invertase in solution phase was washed away
after magnetic separation. Then, 1 mM biotin was used to release desthiobiotinylated
DNA–invertase conjugates from MBs, because biotin could displace
desthiobiotin from streptavidin as a result of its much higher binding
affinity (Figure 1b). After multiple times
of biotin displacement and magnetic separation, the solutions containing
purified DNA–invertase conjugates were combined and condensed
to a desired concentration using a centrifuge filter membrane with
100 kDa cutoff, through which biotin was also removed.

In the
above method using biotin displacement and magnetic separation to
purify the DNA–protein conjugates, the separation was only
determined by whether the protein was conjugated by DNA (containing
desthiobiotin) or not. Other properties of the protein, such as molecular
weight, hydrophobicity and isoelectric point did not play any role
in the separation, suggesting the method can be generally applicable
for all the proteins using almost the same protocol as long as surface
amines are available on the proteins for conjugation. In contrast,
considerations such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity or isoelectric
point of proteins may need to be taken into account to identify the
desired peaks for DNA–protein conjugates in chromatography
and electrophoresis techniques, usually making case-by-case optimizations
required for different proteins.

The activities of the released
DNA–invertase conjugate solutions after each time of biotin
displacement were tested by measuring the amount of glucose production
from sucrose by the conjugates (Supporting Information Figure S2), suggesting DNA conjugation on invertase did not disrupt
the enzyme activity and almost all the conjugates were washed off
by 5 times of biotin displacement. The efficiency of this displacement
method was calculated by adding up the amount of DNA–invertase
conjugates during each time of displacement using UV–vis spectra.
As shown in Table S1 (see Supporting Information for more details), the average yield of recovery for the biotin
displacement approach was estimated as 91.8%, suggesting the high
efficiency of the method.

Fluorescence imaging of ethidium bromide stained 10% native PAGE:

mixture after amicon-100 kDa to remove free DNA (containing 1 and
2), (4) reaction mixture (containing 1, 2, and free DNA), and (5)
desthiobiotinylated DNA. The two bands of DNA are because of the thiol–DNA
and its disulfide-containing dimer form. (b) Coomassie brilliant blue
stained 4–20% gradient SDS PAGE: (1) purified DNA–invertase
conjugates, (2) reaction mixture (containing 1, 3, and 4), (3) invertase,
and (4) desthiobiotinylated DNA.

To demonstrate the purified solution contained only DNA–invertase
conjugates and no unreacted DNA or invertase, native PAGE (10%) and
SDS PAGE (4–20% gradient gel) were carried out to analyze its
composite. After stain of DNA components using ethidium bromide, the
native PAGE image (Figure 2a) suggested unreacted
DNA (lane 5) was efficiently removed from the product mixture (lane
4) by centrifuge filter membranes (lane 3). The band stuck on the
wells are purified DNA–invertase conjugates (lane 2), because
their molecular weights were too large (>100 kDa) for them to migrate
on 10% PAGE. On the other hand, the SDS PAGE image after stain of
invertase components using coomassie brilliant blue (Figure 2b) indicated that unreacted invertase (lane 3) was
also washed away from the mixture (lane 2) to yield purified DNA–invertase
conjugates (lane 1) by the biotin displacement method. The faint top
bands in lane 2 were probably some high molecular weight aggregates
formed because of high invertase and DNA concentrations used for the
conjugation reaction. As shown in lane 1, these aggregates were removed
during the biotin displacement method and not present in the purified
DNA–invertase conjugates.

Figure 3 Absorption spectra of the conjugation
products.

Since the purified DNA–invertase
conjugates were free of unreacted DNA and invertase, we could then
use them to estimate the average number of DNA strands on each invertase
in the conjugates, which was a question not fully addressed in our
previous studies.64−66,70 In UV–vis absorption
spectra (Figure 3), the maximum absorption
of the purified conjugates (blue line) is at 260 nm, which was similar
as that of DNA (black line) but did have a mild shoulder around 280
nm originated from invertase (red line) in the conjugates. The conjugates
exhibited a much stronger UV absorbance at 260 nm (DNA component)
compared with 280 nm (invertase component), because of the much higher
molecular extinction coefficient (ε) of DNA than invertase.
On the basis of the absorbance ratio (260 vs 280 nm) of DNA, invertase
and DNA–invertase conjugates, the molecular ratio of DNA versus
invertase in the purified conjugates was calculated to be ∼5
DNA per invertase (see Supporting Information for details of calculation).

Application in Cocaine
Detection by the Structure-Switching Aptamer
To examine the
ability of the purified DNA–invertase conjugates to enhance
the performance of DNA aptamer sensors, we chose the structure-switching
aptamer for cocaine detection as an example.11 Cocaine is one of the most used recreational drugs in the United
States and its detection is important in the fight against drug abuse
and trafficking. As shown in Figure 4, a biotin-DNA1
containing 18 complementary nucleotides to the cocaine aptamer was
immobilized onto streptavidin-coated MBs via streptavidin–biotin
interaction to capture the aptamer. The amount of biotin-DNA1 loading
on the MBs was determined by the decrease of biotin-DNA1’s
characteristic absorbance at 260 nm in the supernatant before and
after immobilization (Supporting Information Figure S3a). Around 3.53 pmol biotin-DNA1 was loaded onto 1 mg of
MBs based on the calculation. The purified DNA–invertase conjugates
obtained through the method described in the previous section were
hybridized with the aptamer through another 12 base pairs. In the
presence of cocaine, the DNA–invertase conjugates were released
because of the cocaine-induced structure switching of the aptamer.
After magnetic separation, the released conjugates catalyzed the hydrolysis
of PGM-inert sucrose into PGM-detectable glucose, establishing the
relationship between PGM signal readout and the concentration of cocaine
in the samples (Figure 5). A detection limit
of 1.8 μM was achieved according to the definition of 3σb/slope (σb, standard deviation of the blank
samples). This detection limit is better than the test under the same
condition using unpurified DNA–invertase conjugates instead
of purified conjugates for sensor preparation, which resulted in a
higher detection limit of 4.2 μM (similar to that of 3.4 μM
in our previous work,64 using DNA–invertase
conjugates without the biotin displacement approach). The enhanced
performance of the detection using purified DNA–invertase conjugates
over unpurified ones (1.8 vs 4.2 μM), although moderate (2.3-fold),
was most probably due to the presence of unreacted invertase at high
concentrations in the conjugates that cause nonspecific adsorption
of unreacted invertase on the MBs. These adsorbed unreacted invertase
molecules could leak during cocaine detection and thus increased the
blank signals, reducing the signal-to-noise ratio and lowering the
performance. As shown in the inset of Figure 5, at low analyte concentrations, the detection using purified DNA–invertase
conjugates did display a lower blank signal, higher signal-to-noise
ratio (ratio of signal enhancement over blank) and higher sensitivity
according to the slope of calibration curves. On the other hand, the
detection was selective to cocaine, because adenosine at high concentrations
did not give detectable PGM signal changes (Supporting
Information Figure S4), suggesting the selectivity of the aptamer
was well preserved in the sensor design using purified DNA–invertase
conjugates.

conjugates using a PGM.

curve of cocaine detection (inset).

Application in Competitive Hybridization Assay for DNA Detection
In the above sensor design for cocaine detection, there is a washing
step during sensor preparation to remove most unreacted invertase
to ensure that only DNA–invertase conjugates were immobilized
on MBs by DNA hybridization with the biotin-DNA1. Therefore, the use
of purified DNA–invertase conjugates gave only moderate performance
enhancement (detection limit of 1.8 μM) compared to using unpurified
conjugates (detection limit of 4.2 μM). To further demonstrate
the advantage of using purified conjugates, the DNA–invertase
conjugates after purification by the biotin displacement method were
applied in a competitive DNA hybridization assay, and the performance
was then compared with the same assay using unpurified conjugates
instead. In contrast to sandwich assays, competitive assays has the
advantage of requiring no washing steps during the detection, thus
making the detection more simple and efficient.66 In a typical competitive assay (Figure 6a), target DNA and purified DNA–invertase conjugates
were added simultaneously to MBs immobilized with capturing biotin-DNA2.
Around 3.85 pmol biotin-DNA2 was loaded onto 1 mg of MBs based on
the calculation (Supporting Information Figure
S3b). When the target DNA was present, it competed with the purified
DNA–invertase conjugates in hybridizing with the capturing
DNA on MBs. Therefore, less purified DNA–invertase conjugates
were captured on the MBs in the presence of more target DNA. After
magnetic separation to remove MBs, the conjugates remaining in solution
catalyzed the hydrolysis of sucrose into glucose for PGM measurement
(Figure 6a). For samples without target DNA,
most of the purified DNA–invertase conjugates were captured
by MBs, giving a very low blank signal (26 mg/dL, Supporting Information Figure S5), while the signal increased
to 114 mg/dL in the presence of 1 μM target DNA. In contrast,
if unpurified DNA–invertase conjugates were used for the same
assays, the blank signal was found about 8 times as high as that when
using purified conjugates (213 mg/dL, Supporting Information Figure S5), which was because large amounts of unreacted invertase
remained in solution after magnetic separation and caused efficient
glucose production even if no target DNA was present. The signal enhancement
ratio reached 4.4-fold when using the purified conjugates in the assays
while only 1.3-fold for the unpurified conjugates (Figure 6b). The detection limit of the competitive assays
using the purified conjugates was about 2.1 nM (Supporting
Information Figure S6a) compared with 65.2 nM (Supporting Information Figure S6b) for the unpurified conjugates,
indicating a significant performance enhancement by lower the detection
limit from 65.2 to 2.1 nM (more than 30-fold improvement). The selectivity
of this competitive assay toward target DNA over other three types
of DNA molecules (single mismatch, double mismatch and random DNAs)
was also carried out. Addition of these control DNA sequences produced
very low glucose signal enhancement over the blank (Figure 6c).

conjugates using a PGM. (b) PGM signal enhancement of DNA detection
with purified DNA–invertase conjugates (red line) and unpurified
conjugates (black line). (c) Selectivity of competitive DNA assay

In summary, a simple and efficient
method to purify DNA–invertase conjugates from the mixture
containing the conjugates and unreacted invertase and DNA was developed
in this study. The method was based on a biotin displacement strategy
to release desthiobiotinylated DNA–invertase conjugates from
streptavidin-coated MBs for purification. The applications of these
purified DNA–invertase conjugates in a structure-switching
aptamer sensor for cocaine and a competitive hybridization assay for
DNA were also demonstrated, and both experiments showed enhanced analytical
performance compared with the same assays using unpurified DNA–invertase
conjugates. Because the amine and thiol modifications on DNA are commercially
available and nearly all proteins have surface reactive amines for
conjugation, the method reported in this study can be generally applied
for the preparation and purification of almost any DNA–protein
conjugates for various applications.
