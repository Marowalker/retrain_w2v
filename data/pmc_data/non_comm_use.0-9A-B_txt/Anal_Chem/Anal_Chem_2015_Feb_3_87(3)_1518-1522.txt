Multiplex polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) has been widely utilized
for high-throughput pathogen identification. Often, a dye is used
to intercalate the amplified DNA fragments, and identifications of
the pathogens are carried out by DNA melting curve analysis or gel
electrophoresis. Integrating DNA amplification and identification
is a logic path toward maximizing the benefit of multiplex PCR. Although
PCR and gel electrophoresis have been integrated, replenishing the
gels after each run is tedious and time-consuming. In this technical
note, we develop an approach to address this issue. We perform multiplex
PCR inside a capillary, transfer the amplified fragments to a bare
narrow capillary, and measure their lengths online using bare narrow
capillary–hydrodynamic chromatography (BaNC-HDC), a new technique
recently developed in our laboratory for free-solution DNA separation.
To intercalate the DNA with YOYO-1 (a fluorescent dye) for BaNC-HDC,
we flush the capillary column with a YOYO-1 solution; positively charged
YOYO-1 is adsorbed (or charged) onto the negatively charged capillary
wall. As DNA molecules are driven down the column for separation,
they react with the YOYO-1 stored on the capillary wall and are online-intercalated
with the dye. With a single YOYO-1 charging, the column can be used
for more than 40 runs, although the fluorescence signal intensities
of the DNA peaks decrease gradually. Although the dye-DNA intercalation
occurs during the separation, it does not affect the retention times,
separation efficiencies, or resolutions.

==== Body
Polymerase
chain reaction (PCR)
is widely used for analysis of a specific segment of DNA, or a DNA
variation. Multiplex PCR is a variant of conventional PCR in which
two or more loci are simultaneously amplified in the same reaction.
Since its introduction in 1988,1 this technique
has been utilized successfully in various areas of DNA analyses such
as DNA deletion,2,3 mutation4 and polymorphism,5 DNA quantitative assays,6 etc. Multiplex PCR can also be utilized to boost
the sample throughput7−12 for strain identification. Analysis of the products of multiplex
PCR is often carried out by electrophoretic separation8−10,12 or DNA melting curve analysis.13 PCR and the following electrophoretic separation
have been integrated;14−17 however, because the gels used in the above integrated devices need
to be replenished after each run, to prevent the gels from being blocked
by large DNA templates, performing the separations is tedious and
time-consuming. In this Technical Note, we describe a new approach
to address this issue. We perform multiplex PCR inside a capillary
tube, transfer the amplified fragments to a narrow capillary online,
and measure their lengths by bare narrow capillary – hydrodynamic
chromatography (BaNC-HDC),18,19 which is a new technique
developed in our laboratory for free-solution DNA separation. BaNC-HDC
is capable of resolving DNA with a wide size range, and the separation
is performed in a solution without any sieving matrices. PCR products
can be injected directly into a BaNC-HDC column for separation without
any purification (such as DNA template/enzyme removal, desalting,
etc.).

To prepare a sample for BaNC-HDC separation, the PCR
products must
be fluorescently labeled. Labeling these DNA can be accomplished by
throwing a fluorescent intercalating dye in the solution either during
the reactions if the dye (e.g., SYBR Green I) is compatible with the
PCR, or after the reactions if the dye (e.g., YOYO-1) is incompatible
with the PCR. In this experiment, we focus on the latter. To intercalate
the DNA with YOYO-1, we flush the bare narrow capillary with a YOYO-1
solution; positively charged YOYO-1 is adsorbed (or charged) onto
the negatively charged capillary wall. As DNA molecules are driven
down the capillary column for separation, they react with YOYO-1 stored
on the capillary wall and are online-intercalated with the dye. With
a single YOYO-1 charging, the column can be used for more than 40
runs, although the fluorescence signal intensities of the DNA peaks
decrease gradually. Although the dye-DNA intercalation occurs during
the separation, it does not affect the retention times, separation
efficiencies, or resolutions.

Experimental Section
Materials and Reagents
YOYO-1 was purchased from Life
Technologies (Grand Island, NY). A DNA ladder (1-kb plus), tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane
(Tris), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and other common reagents
were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Fused-silica
capillaries were purchased from Polymicro Technologies (Phoenix, AZ).
10.0 mM tris-EDTA (TE) buffer consisted of 10.0 mM Tris and 1.00 mM
EDTA, and its pH was adjusted to 8.0. All solutions were prepared
using ultrapure water (Nanopure Ultrapure Water System, Barnstead,
Dubuque, IA), filtered through a 0.22 μm filter (VWR Scientific,
Sugar Land, TX), and vacuum-degassed before use.

Apparatus
Figure 1A presents
the apparatus used in this experiment to perform multiplex PCR, online
DNA–YOYO-1 intercalation, and BaNC-HDC separation. The system
consisted of a pressure chamber (PC), a chip injector (C), a PCR capillary
and a thermocycler (TC), a six-port valve, a BaNC-HDC column, and
a confocal laser-induced fluorescence detector (D). The detailed descriptions
of the pressure chamber, chip injector, and detector can be seen in
the Supporting Information (SI). The PCR
capillary had a length of 2 m, and an inner diameter (i.d.) of 75
μm, and it was treated with dichlorodimethylsilane and bovine
serum albumin; the detailed treatment procedure is described in the SI. The thermocycler (TC) used is a MJ Research
PTC-200 Peltier Thermal Cycler. A six-port valve was utilized in conjunction
with the chip injector to facilitate sample injection for BaNC-HDC
separation. The valve could be switched between an “open”
position (as the PCR capillary from position 2 and auxiliary capillary
from position 4 on the chip injector were connected to sample (S)
and waste (W)) and a “closed” position (as the above
two capillaries were connected to blocked ports). The BaNC-HDC column
was a fused silica capillary having a length of 55 cm and an i.d.
of 2 μm.

The solid dots depicted on the six-port injection valve indicate ports
that are blocked. Capillaries are connected to positions 1, 2, 3,
and 4 on microchip injector are separation capillary, PCR capillary,
pressure capillary, and waste capillary, respectively. The separation
capillary had a length of 55 cm (35 cm effective), an outer diameter
(o.d.) of 150 μm, and an i.d. of 2 μm. The PCR capillary
had a length of 2 m, an o.d. of 150 μm, and an i.d. of 75 μm.
The pressure capillary had a length of 10 cm, an o.d. of 150 μm,
and an i.d. of 20 μm. The waste capillary had a length of 30
cm, an o.d. of 150 μm, and an i.d. of 75 μm. Panels (B)–(G)
depict schematic diagrams for illustrating major operating procedures;
the arrows indicate the flow directions (see details in text).

Performing Multiplex PCR,
Online YOYO-1 Intercalation, and BaNC-HDC
Separation
After the apparatus was assembled as shown in
Figure 1, ∼4 nL of 7.0 μM YOYO-1
in 1× TE buffer (10.0 mM Tris-HCl and 1.0 mM EDTA at pH 8.0),
and then ∼4 nL of 1× TE buffer were flushed through the
BaNC-HDC column from the waste side under a pressure of ∼350
psi. The system was initialized after a vacuum was applied to the
waste side (W) on the six-port valve to clean the YOYO-1 in the chip
injector. The operating procedures depicted in Figure 1 can be described as follows:

Step 1 (Figure 1B): A multiplex PCR solution was
first aspirated into the PCR capillary by applying a vacuum to the
waste side (W) on the six-port valve while the valve was set at the
“open” position. At this time, an ambient pressure or
a pressure (∼10 psi) slightly higher than the ambient pressure
was applied to the pressure chamber (PC).

Step
2 (Figure 1C): The valve was
switched to the “closed” position,
and thermal cycle reactions were performed (see the SI for details).

Step 3 (Figure 1D): The valve was switched back
to the “open”
position while a vacuum was applied to W to pull the PCR products
into the cross section of the chip injector.

Step
4 (Figure 1E): The valve was
switched to the “closed” position,
and a predetermined pressure (e.g., 40 psi) was applied to PC for
a given period of time (e.g., 10 s); a portion of the sample in the
cross section was driven to the BaNC-HDC column. The amount of the
injected sample was controlled by the pressure and the injection time.

Step 5 (Figure 1F): The valve was switched to the “open” position while
a pressure (e.g., 40 psi) was applied to PC; the residue sample in
the cross section of the chip injector was flushed away from the inlet
of the BaNC-HDC column.

Step 6 (Figure 1G): The valve was switched to the
“closed” position,
and a predetermined pressure (e.g., 200 psi) was applied to PC to
effect BaNC-HDC separation.

Results and Discussion
To characterize our approach for online DNA–YOYO-1 intercalation,
we used an experimental setup that was reported previously18 (see Figure S1 in the SI for details). In one experiment, we used a bare capillary column
and separated a 1-kbp-plus DNA ladder preintercalated with YOYO-1.
The bottom trace of Figure 2 presents the separation
results. In a separate experiment, we charged YOYO-1 on the interior
surface of the capillary column and separated the same DNA ladder
but without YOYO-1 intercalation. The top trace of Figure 2 presents the separation results; all DNA fragments
were nicely labeled and detected, and comparable resolutions and similar
retention times were obtained. That is, we did not sacrifice any performance
by using the online intercalation approach.

Figure 2 Comparison of the online-labeled
methodology and the prelabeled
methodology. The top trace shows the BaNC-HDC separation of an online-labeled
DNA ladder (0.075, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0,
5.0, 7.0, 10, and 20 kbp), while the bottom trace presents the separation
of a prelabeled DNA ladder. The nanocapillary had a total length of
50 cm (40 cm effective) and a radius of 1 μm. The 1-kb-plus
DNA ladder (total DNA = 4 ng/μL) was injected at 40 psi for
10 s, and the separation was carried out at 350 psi.

Importantly, we do not need to recharge YOYO-1
for every BaNC-HDC
separation. Figure 3A presents a few typical
traces (the 1st, 10th, 20th, 30th, and 45th runs) as we injected the
same sample repetitively after we charged the BaNC-HDC column once.
Apparently, as the repetitive-injection test proceeded, the YOYO-1
storage on the capillary wall shrank. As a result, the number of YOYO-1
molecules intercalated with each DNA fragment diminished, and, consequently,
the fluorescence intensities decreased (Figure 3B). An excellent feature of this approach is that, although fluorescence
intensities decreased gradually, the resolution, efficiency, and retention
time remained virtually unchanged (see Figure
S2 in the SI for details). All DNA fragments could be positively
identified and their sizes be accurately measured even after dozens
of injections (e.g., see the inset of Figure 3A for an expanded view of the BaNC-HDC trace of the 45th run).

Figure 3 Repetitive
run after single-time YOYO-1 charging: (A) typical separation
traces of DNA ladder (4 ng/μL total DNA) (the inset presents
an expanded view of the 45th run); and (B) peak areas varying with
the number of repetitive runs. All separation conditions were the
same as those presented in Figure 2.

To demonstrate the utility of
this approach for practical uses,
we assembled a system (Figure 1) that integrated
a capillary PCR device, a microchip injector, and a BaNC-HDC column
in a microfluidic format for multiplex PCR, online injection, BaNC-HDC
separation, and online DNA-YOYO-1 intercalation. The resolved DNA
bands were monitored via a laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detector. Figure 4A presents the separation results
of multiplex PCR products. The sizes of three products were estimated
(see the SI for details) to be 1.080, 0.895,
and 0.398 kbp, which is in excellent agreement with their theoretical
values (1.074, 0.874, and 0.400, respectively). Figure 4B presents the slab-gel separation results; the multiplex
PCR was performed using a conventional Eppendorf tube and a MJ Research
thermocycler. Figure 4C presents the separation
of a segment of a rice genomic DNA amplified in the PCR capillary.
Because BaNC-HDC can tolerate large DNA template, the amplified fragment
was online-transferred to the BaNC-HDC column for separation. The
BaNC-HDC separations were executed under ∼400 psi, and DNA–YOYO-1
intercalation was accomplished during the separation. The size of
the fragment was measured to be 404 bp, compared to its theoretical
value of 405 bp. Figure 4D presents the slab-gel
separation result of the conventionally amplified product.

Figure 4 Performing
multiplex PCR, BaNC-HDC separation, and online dye intercalation
on an integrated microfluidic platform. Panel (A) shows BaNC-HDC separation
traces; the top trace was obtained from separating a 1-kbp-plus DNA
ladder, and the bottom trace was obtained from separating the multiplex
PCR products amplified in the capillary thermocycler (30 cycles; see Capillary PCR in the SI for details). The BaNC-HDC
separations were executed under ∼200 psi. Panel (B) shows the
slab–gel electrophoresis of the crude multiplex PCR products
amplified by a MJ Research thermocycler (30 cycles). (“Lane
1” shows data from the DNA ladder; “Lane 2” shows
data from crude PCR multiplex products.) Panel (C) shows BaNC-HDC
separation of a PCR-amplified genomic region (30 cycles; see Capillary PCR in the SI for details). The top
trace represents the separation of a 1-kbp-plus DNA ladder, and the
bottom trace is the result of the separation of an actin sequence
from a rice genomic DNA that was amplified by the capillary PCR and
online-intercalated with YOYO-1. The BaNC-HDC separations were executed
under ∼400 psi. Other conditions were similar to those described
for Panel (A). Panel (D) shows the slab–gel electrophoresis
of a conventional PCR-amplified actin sequence. (“Lane 1”
shows data from the DNA ladder, and “Lane 2” shows data
from the actin.) Other conditions were similar to those described
for Panel (B).

Conclusions
We
have developed an innovative and simple approach for the online
intercalation of YOYO-1 with DNA. The method consumed only ∼4
nL of YOYO-1 solution to charge the BaNC-HDC column, and the YOYO-1
adsorbed on the capillary wall allows for dozens of BaNC-HDC runs
without recharging. Taking advantage of an excellent feature of BaNC-HDC
for tolerating high salt contents, large DNA templates, and big enzyme
molecules required for PCR, we have integrated a capillary PCR with
BaNC-HDC and this online intercalation approach onto a microfluidic
platform. We finally demonstrated the feasibility of using this platform
for multiplexed PCR, online intercalation of the amplified products,
BaNC-HDC separation, and LIF detection. With the advancement of microfluidic
and nanofluidic devices for bioanalysis, single-DNA molecules have
been entrapped in nanopores for enzyme digestions,20 microfluidic chips have been developed for PCR,21,22 and a miniaturized LIF detector23 has
also been constructed for detection on microfluidic chips. The reported
microfluidic platform, combining with the above technologies, holds
great promises for point-of-care applications.
