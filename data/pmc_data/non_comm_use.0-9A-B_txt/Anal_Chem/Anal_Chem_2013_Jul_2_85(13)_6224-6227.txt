A direct, ambient ionization method
has been developed using atmospheric
pressure thermal desorption–extractive electrospray–mass
spectrometry (AP/TD-EESI-MS) for the detection of the genotoxic impurity
(GTI) methyl p-toluenesulfonate (MTS) in a surrogate
pharmaceutical matrix. A custom-made thermal desorption probe was
used to the desorb and vaporize MTS from the solid state, by rapid
heating to 200 °C then cooling to ambient temperature, with a
cycle time of 6 min. The detection of MTS using EESI with a sodium
acetate doped solvent to generate the [MTS+Na]+ adduct
ion provided a significant sensitivity enhancement relative to the
[M+H]+ ion generated using a 0.1% formic acid solvent modifier.
The MTS detection limit is over an order of magnitude below the long-term
daily threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) of 1.5 μg/g and
the potential for quantitative analysis has been determined using
starch as a surrogate active pharmaceutical ingredient (API).

==== Body
The ability
to detect genotoxic
impurities (GTIs) at low concentrations in active pharmaceutical ingredients
(APIs) is important in the development of APIs.1 The use of sulfonic acids as counterions during salt crystallization
can result in undesired reactions with alcohols to form sulfonate
esters.2 The genotoxicity of sulfonic acid
esters was reported by Glowienke et al. in 2005, based on in vitro
salmonella reverse mutation (Ames)3 and
micronucleus tests.4 The Ames test indicated
that most sulfonic acid esters generated at least a 2-fold increase
of revertants, i.e., his– auxotrophs
to his+ prototrophs, in relation to controls.
The micronucleus assay supported these findings with most compounds
showing genotoxic properties due to the numbers of micronuclei (chromosomal
aberrations) formed within the cultured mouse lymphoma cells (L5178Y),
in comparison to controls.5 The United
States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) and Europe’s European
Medicines Agency (EMA) have established a threshold of toxicological
concern (TTC) of 1.5 μg day–1 (1.5 ppm, assuming
a daily dose of 1 g) for long-term treatments and a staged TTC where
increased levels for limited periods are allowed for the purpose of
drug development.6 The international conference
on harmonization, Q3A(RS) and M7 (step 2),7,8 has
outlined the industry requirements for the qualification of GTIs in
drug products. The pharmaceutical industry must demonstrate control
and evaluation of raw materials (to a given threshold) that have the
potential to form genotoxic impurities during drug production.9−11 The case for control of sulfonate salts can be exemplified by Nefinavir
mesilate, which is sold under the brand name of Viracept, produced
by Roche, where an error in production generated elevated levels of
sulfonate esters in the final product, which was subsequently withdrawn
from the European markets.12

The
threshold limit applied to sulfonate esters has led to the
development of several analytical approaches for the determination
of these GTIs.13 The most widely used method
is gas chromatography (GC) combined with mass spectrometry (MS)14,15 or flame ionization detection (FID).16 The derivatization of sulfonate esters prior to headspace GC-MS,17,18 and sample preconcentration using solid phase microextraction (SPME)19 have also been employed to achieve the levels
of sensitivity required. Other approaches include liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC-MS) and liquid chromatography–tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).20−22 The ability to accurately detect
the sulfonate esters is limited by their relative stability, since
the compounds may degrade during sample preparation, leading to poor
analytical sensitivity; therefore, rapid detection of these compounds
is advantageous. To date, the application of direct analysis techniques
to the determination of GTIs in pharmaceutical formulations has received
little attention. The mesylate, besylate, and tosylate sulfonates
are low-molecular-weight compounds with boiling points that are generally
below 200 °C, indicating that thermal desorption (TD) could be
employed as a possible sampling mechanism. The potential of GTI detection
by direct analysis was recently demonstrated in 2011 by McCullough
et al., using online extractive electrospray (EESI) sampling from
a heated reaction mixture, where codeine was used as a surrogate GTI.23

In this paper, an in-house designed and
constructed TD probe capable
of heating solid and liquid samples to temperatures in excess of 350
°C was interfaced to a quadrupole-time-of-flight-mass (Q-ToF)
spectrometer. The desorbed methyl p-toluenesulfate
ester (MTS) vapor was detected as a sodium salt adduct ionized by
extractive electrospray24 in the presence
of 0.01 M sodium acetate. This novel approach to the direct detection
of MTS in a surrogate API mixture (starch) is demonstrated to levels
below a TTC of 1.5 μg/g required by the FDA and EMA regulatory
bodies.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
Analytical-grade water
and methanol were
purchased from Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, U.K.). HPLC grade
formic acid, sodium acetate (≥99.0%), methyl p-toluenesulfonate (≥97.0%) and potato starch were purchased
from Sigma–Aldrich (Gillingham, U.K.). All chemicals were used
without further purification.

AP/TD Probe
A
schematic diagram of the ion source region
of a Waters Synapt HDMS spectrometer (Waters, Manchester, U.K.) modified
for AP/TD-EESI-MS is shown in Figure 1. The
TD probe was constructed by placing a cylindrical heater cartridge
(2.5 mm o.d. × 50 mm; RS Components Ltd., Northants, U.K.) into
a stainless steel tube (12 mm i.d. × 300 mm) with the heater
positioned inside an aluminum adaptor at the probe tip. Samples were
placed in a brass sample holder (o.d. 2.5 mm × 10 mm) located
within the aluminum adaptor, with the base of the sample holder in
direct contact with the heater cartridge. The sample holder was inserted
through a hole in the side of a stainless steel tube (o.d. 12 mm ×
50 mm) located between the ESI probe and the mass spectrometer inlet
cone that spatially confines the thermally desorbed analytes for ionization
by an in-line electrospray plume. The cartridge temperature was set
using a regulated temperature controller (Tempatron, Reading, U.K.)
capable of a maximum operating temperature of 400 °C. The operating
temperatures set to 250 °C resulted in experimental temperatures
of >190 °C within 2 min. The AP-TD probe was cooled using
a flow
of chilled air (10 L min–1 at 10 °C) through
the probe.

Sample Preparation
Methyl p-toluenesulfonate
standards were prepared in methanol at concentrations of 0.5–10
ng μL–1. [Note: MTS is genotoxic and
should therefore be handled in low volumes within a fume hood, using
suitable personal protection.] This was performed by incineration.
In the TD experiments, MTS standards were placed into the sample holder
and immediately introduced into the ion source. For surrogate API
experiments, 10 μL of standard solution was added to 50 mg of
starch, equivalent to concentrations in the range 0.1–2 ppm
(w/w), using aluminum foil sample wraps which were
prepared prior to analysis and placed into the sample holder. A small
hole was made in the aluminum foil immediately before thermal desorption.

EESI-MS Conditions
The EESI solvent consisted of 50:50
MeOH:H2O (v/v) modified
with 0.1% formic acid (v/v) in initial
studies and 0.01 M sodium acetate (NaOAc) in all other investigations,
which were infused from a syringe pump at a flow rate of 8 μL
min–1. The mass spectrometer (Synapt HDMS, Waters,
Manchester, U.K.) was operated in sensitivity (V) mode, using positive
ionization with a capillary voltage of 3 kV and a cone voltage of
20 V. The source and desolvation temperatures were set to 150 and
120 °C, respectively, and the source gas flow rate (N2) was set to 20 L h–1.

Results and Discussion
The application of atmospheric pressure thermal desorption–extractive
electrospray–mass spectrometry (AP/TD-EESI-MS) to the analysis
of a GTI with the thermal desorption probe introduced into the modified
ion source region of the Q-ToF spectrometer was evaluated using methyl p-toluenesulfonate (MTS). The responses of the protonated
and sodiated MTS ions generated by extractive electrospray24 were monitored during the introduction of thermally
desorbed MTS vapor into the ion source. The mass spectra of MTS acquired
using a methanol/water EESI plume with the addition of 0.1% formic
acid (v/v) and 0.01 M NaOAc as solvent-modifying
agents are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Mass spectra obtained
using thermal desorption of MTS vapor into
the modified EESI ion source (50:50 (v/v) MeOH:H2O) with (a) 0.1% formic acid (v/v) solvent
modifier and (b) 0.01 M sodium acetate modifier.

Figure 2a shows the MTS response using
0.1%
formic acid as the solvent modifier with the [M+H]+ ion
at m/z 187.0440 (5.8 ppm mass error)
present as the base peak. However, the protonated MTS fragments readily
in the interface of the mass spectrometer yielding products at m/z 155, assigned to [MH–CH3OH]+, an unidentified rearrangement ion at m/z 127 and the tropylium ion at m/z 91, which reduces the sensitivity for
the [M+H]+ ion. The presence of an [M+Na]+ ion
in the mass spectrum (Figure 2a) indicates
an ionization process involving conversion of a gas-phase (neutral)
MTS molecule into a sodiated gas phase ion by interaction with a solvent
droplet containing traces of sodium in the EESI plume. The co-ordination
of Na+ with tosylate molecules has been reported by Bai
et al., who demonstrated that detection was improved by the formation
of alkali metal adducts.21 Doping the EESI
solvent with 0.01 M sodium acetate exclusively yielded the [M+Na]+ ion for MTS (m/z 209.0258;
4.8 ppm mass error; Figure 2b). The absence
of the [M+H]+and its associated fragments in the mass spectrum
improves analyte sensitivity increasing the mass spectral response
by a factor of ∼2 for the [M+Na]+ ion using 0.01
M sodium acetate compared to the formic acid doped EESI plume and
no fragmentation of the sodiated ion was observed. A sodium-doped
EESI plume was used in all subsequent experiments.

The TD probe
can achieve a temperature of ∼200 °C in
2 min, which was found to be sufficient for the desorption of MTS
vapor. After reaching the maximum desorption temperature, the probe
was cooled by a flow of chilled air. The flow of cooled gas passed
through the probe and exited at the probe tip, which rapidly cooled
the sample holder to ambient temperatures with a total run time of
5 min.

The AP/TD-EESI-MS analysis of MTS was carried out with
the GTI
spiked into 50 mg of starch to simulate the environment of an API.
The samples were preprepared using sealed aluminum foil wraps that
were pierced prior to analysis. The use of the disposable aluminum
wraps prevented sample cross contamination and provided a rapid method
of exchanging samples, reducing sample to sample cycle time to 6 min,
which is significantly shorter than previously reported GC-MS and
LC-MS run-times of 24 and 11 min, respectively.12,17 An example of the thermal desorption profile and mass spectrometric
response obtained for the AP/TD-EESI-MS analysis of MTS in starch
is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 AP/TD-EESI-MS analysis
of MTS (2 ppm (w/w); 100 ng MTS in 50 mg
starch) (a) total ion response; (b) selected-ion response for the
sodiated MTS adduct ion (m/z 209.02
± 0.02); and (c) summed, background subtracted mass spectrum
for MTS.

The total ion response for a 50
mg starch sample (Figure 3a), used as a surrogate
API, spiked with MTS at
a level of 2 ppm initially increases with the probe temperature and
then decreases when the heat is removed and the cooling gas flow initiated.
The ion response returns to baseline levels within 4 min, but the
temperature of the sample holder at this point is still too high to
be handled (∼70 °C) and requires an additional 1 min of
cooling. The selected ion response for the sodiated MTS ion ([M+Na]+, 209.02 ± 0.02) is shown in Figure 3b. The volatility of the MTS provides a sharp desorption peak,
with a peak width at half height of 15 s. The maximum response for
MTS is observed at 0.9 min when the TD probe temperature was ∼100
°C. The MTS response returns to baseline levels within 3 min.
The mass spectrum obtained from the MTS desorption peak is shown in
Figure 3c. The background-subtracted spectrum,
averaged across the peak at half height, shows a base-peak response
for the sodiated MTS ion (7.7 ppm mass error). The application of
AP/TD-EESI-MS removes the requirement for lengthy sample preparation
and derivatization steps associated with other MTS detection techniques;15,16 because low-volatility APIs will not be desorbed by TD, and sample
throughput is maximized by reducing total analysis time and using
disposable sample holders.

The AP/TD-EESI-MS technique has a
limit of detection (S/N 3:1)
at 0.1 ppm (0.1 μg/g), which is 15 times lower than the limit
set by the FDA and the EMA allows the detection of MTS (3:1, signal:noise).
The correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.983)
and the percentage relative standard deviation (%RSD) of 22% for the
MTS peak areas at the 0.1 ppm level, are affected by the requirement
to remove and replace the TD probe in the AP/TD-EESI source for each
individual sample. The %RSD and linearity values are acceptable for
such a manual analytical technique, used without an internal standard,
but they do not yet meet the requirements for the use of the AP/TD-ESI-MS
technique for quantitative measurements.25 The direct analysis method exceeds the detection requirements for
MTS, indicating its potential as a rapid screening procedure based
on a limit test to show that the MTS is below the TTC level. This
application would be a useful indicator of the presence/absence of
potential impurity, which could then be determined quantitatively
using a well-established technique such as GC-MS.

Conclusions
The direct detection of MTS in a surrogate API matrix is demonstrated
using a TD probe combined with electrospray-mass spectrometry. This
direct, ambient ionization approach offers reduced sample preparation
and analysis times compared to previous GC and LC techniques, enabling
high throughput analyses. The thermal desorption of MTS from a surrogate
API matrix and co-ordination with sodium to form a stable vapor-phase
sodium adduct ion provides levels of sensitivity that are greater
than the regulatory requirements for this GTI. The technique has potential
application to the screening of APIs for MTS, and potentially other
alkyl sulfonate esters, formed during the pharmaceutical manufacturing
processes.
