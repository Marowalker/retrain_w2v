Isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC) is conventionally used to
acquire thermodynamic data for biological interactions. In recent
years, ITC has emerged as a powerful tool to characterize enzyme kinetics.
In this study, we have adapted a single-injection method (SIM) to
study the kinetics of human soluble epoxide hydrolase (hsEH), an enzyme
involved in cardiovascular homeostasis, hypertension, nociception,
and insulin sensitivity through the metabolism of epoxy-fatty acids
(EpFAs). In the SIM method, the rate of reaction is determined by
monitoring the thermal power, while the substrate is being depleted,
overcoming the need for synthetic substrates and reducing postreaction
processing. Our results show that ITC enables the detailed, rapid,
and reproducible characterization of the hsEH-mediated hydrolysis
of several natural EpFA substrates. Furthermore, we have applied a
variant of the single-injection ITC method for the detailed description
of enzyme inhibition, proving the power of this approach in the rapid
screening and discovery of new hsEH inhibitors using the enzyme’s
physiological substrates. The methods described herein will enable
further studies on EpFAs’ metabolism and biology, as well as
drug discovery investigations to identify and characterize hsEH inhibitors.
This also promises to provide a general approach for the characterization
of lipid catalysis, given the challenges that lipid metabolism studies
pose to traditional spectroscopic techniques.

==== Body
Human soluble
epoxide hydrolase
(hsEH, EC 3.3.2.10) is a bifunctional enzyme composed of two structurally
and functionally independent domains.1,2 The C-terminal
domain (CTD) is responsible for the hydrolysis of numerous epoxy-fatty
acids (EpFAs), bioactive epoxidation products of mono- and polyunsaturated
fatty acids with essential roles in cellular and organism homeostasis.2−4 hsEH CTD hydrolyzes EpFAs via an SN2 nucleophilic attack by D335
on the more accessible carbon of the epoxide ring, forming an alkyl-enzyme
intermediate, which is then released by the assisted action of D496
and H524.1,2,5 The catalytic
triad is located in the vertex of a large “L-shaped”
active site and is surrounded by two hydrophobic surfaces dubbed the
W334 niche and the F265 pocket, wherein the aliphatic chains of the
EpFAs are accommodated.1,2,4−6

The best characterized EpFAs substrates of
hsEH CTD are the epoxyeicosatrienoic
acids (EETs), epoxy derivatives of arachidonic acid (ARA;7Figure S1A). Although
four EET regioisomers, namely, 5(6)EET, 8(9)EET, 11(12)EET, and 14(15)EET,
have been isolated in several organs,8 the
latter two have been shown to be the predominant ARA epoxidation metabolites.9 EETs function primarily as endothelial-derived
hyperpolarizing factors in the cardiovascular system and kidneys.7 They play a role in vasorelaxation and vascular
homeostasis, exerting anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic actions.7 The bioavailability of EETs is reduced by hsEH-mediated
hydrolysis of their epoxy ring to generate the corresponding vicinal
diols, namely, dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs; Figure S1A), which possess a considerably reduced biological
activity.7

In addition to EETs, hsEH
hydrolyzes several bioactive epoxy derivatives
of linoleic acid (LA) and α-linoleic acid (ALA), including α-
and γ-epoxyoctadecadienoic acids (α/γ-EpODEs), epoxyeicosatetraenoic
acids (EpETEs), epoxydocosapentaenoic acids (EpDPEs), and epoxyoctadecaenoic
acids (EpOMEs;10,11Figure S1B). The physiological role of α- and γ-EpODEs is yet unknown,
although their hydrolysis products, the γ-dihydroxy-octadecadienoic
acids (γ-DiHODE), exhibit a moderate positive inotropic effect.12 EpETEs and EpDPEs show a similar breadth of
activities to EETs.13 Vasodilation, antithrombotic,
antiangiogenic, and anti-inflammatory effects have been ascribed to
both EpETEs and EpDPEs, as well as diminished tumor growth and metastasis
in murine models.10,14,15 Interestingly, the hsEH-mediated hydrolysis product of 19(20)EpDPE,
namely, the 19(20)-dihydroxy-docosapentaenoic acid (19(20)DiHDPE),
accumulates in the retinas and vitreous humor of diabetic retinopathy
patients, as a result of increased expression levels of the enzyme,
and aggravates disease severity by altering the localization of cholesterol-binding
proteins in the cell membrane and leading to a breakdown of endothelial
barrier function.16

Contrary to the
largely beneficial physiological effects ascribed
to other EpFAs, 9(10)- and 12(13)EpOMEs inhibit mitochondrial respiration
in various tissues, leading to cardiotoxicity, renal failure, and
adult respiratory distress syndrome,17,18 albeit cytotoxicity
is significantly increased in their sEH-catalyzed products, the dihydroxy-octadecaenoic
acids (DiHOMEs).17

Interestingly,
a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) study revealed that hsEH displays a different hydrolytic
efficiency toward its various EpFA substrates.10 Although this work provided a first assessment of catalytic
profiles for several epoxy fatty acids, potential drawbacks of this
methodological approach include the following: (i) it is a discontinuous
method, with potentially non-negligible experimental errors; (ii)
it requires several sample manipulation steps that could lead to reproducibility
issues; (iii) it is time-consuming, technically challenging, and expensive.
Herein, we present an isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)-based
method for the systematic characterization of hsEH catalytic efficiency
toward its EpFAs substrates. By measuring the intrinsic heat of hsEH-mediated
hydrolysis of the epoxy-fatty acids in a continuous manner,19−23 our method circumvents the limiting issue of the lack of physicochemical
properties of EpFAs substrates/products that can be monitored in real
time in a continuous manner.19−23 This new ITC application shows promise in the complete and highly
reproducible characterization of hsEH-mediated catalysis of epoxy-fatty
acids, with relatively low sample amounts, low costs, and rapid acquisition
times.

The second goal of our study was to establish an easy
and versatile
method to measure inhibition properties of sEH antagonists against
natural substrates. Given that dihydroxy-fatty acids generated by
hsEH exhibit either cytotoxic effects or reduced biological activity
compared to their epoxy precursors, pharmacological inhibition of
hsEH has emerged as an extremely appealing therapeutic strategy to
increase EpFAs bioavailability and reap their beneficial properties.24−26 Currently, screening of hsEH inhibitors is mostly performed via
a high-throughput spectrofluorimetric assay,27,28 a fast, economical and highly convenient method that nonetheless
carries the main drawback of not employing physiological substrates.
To address this, we have adapted an ITC method developed by Di Trani
et al.21 Using a well-known hsEH antagonist
as a model system, we demonstrate here that this technique holds promise
for the quantitative screening of new hsEH inhibitors using endogenous
EpFAs substrates.

Experimental Section
Enzyme, Substrate, and
Inhibitor Sample Preparation
Recombinant hsEH CTD was obtained
as described.29 This was shown to be necessary
and sufficient for EpFA
catalysis and to retain the same kinetic profile as full length protein.29 Protein, EpFAs substrates, and inhibitor AUDA
(12-[[(tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]dec-1-ylamino)carbonyl]amino]-dodecanoic
acid) were prepared as reported in the Supporting Information.

Single-Injection ITC Kinetics Measurements
The theoretical
basis of kinetic measurements by ITC has been described,19,22,30,31 and details are given in the Supporting Information. Briefly, in a single injection ITC experiment, the total heat measured
is proportional to the apparent enthalpy (ΔHapp), and the number of moles of product generated. The
reaction rate can be related to the amount of heat generated over
time. From the derived Michaelis–Menten plots, the affinity
for the substrate (KM), turnover rate
(kcat), and catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM = Ksp) values can be obtained.

Experiments
were performed on MicroCal PEAQ-ITC and MicroCal iTC200 calorimeters
(Malvern). An hsEH CTD solution at 250 nM was placed in the sample
cell, and a 0.5–1.5 mM substrate solution was loaded in the
injection syringe. One single 38 μL injection was performed
with a speed of 0.58–0.76 μL s–1. Controls
were carried out as described in the Supporting Information. Apparent enthalpy of the reaction, heat rate (dQ/dt), and Michaelis–Menten plots
were generated using MicroCal PEAQ-ITC Analysis Software (Malvern).

Progressive Inhibition ITC Enzyme Kinetics Measurements
A solution containing 0.5 mM of 14(15)EET and 67.37 nM of AUDA was
injected into the cell containing 250 nM of hsEH CTD. Four 9.5 μL
injections of 12.5 s each were performed at a speed of 0.76 μL
s–1. Control experiments are described in the Supporting Information. Apparent reaction enthalpy,
dQ/dt rates, and Michaelis–Menten
parameters were generated using the MicroCal PEAQ-ITC Analysis Software
(Malvern). Apparent KM values (KM′) were obtained,32 and data fitting in GraphPad provided the KM′/Ki ratio,20,21 where Ki is the inhibition constant.

Inhibitory Constant Measurements with a Spectrofluorometric
Method
AUDA inhibitory potency was tested with a spectrofluorometric
method,28 detailed in the Supporting Information.

Results
A Single-Injection
ITC Method Characterizes the Kinetics of
hsEH CTD-Mediated Hydrolysis of 14(15)EET
To probe the kinetics
of EpFA hydrolysis catalyzed by hsEH CTD, we employed an ITC single-injection
method (SIM).22,23 The substrate solution in the
syringe of the calorimeter was injected in a single step into the
sample cell containing the enzyme solution, producing a heat response
which endured for as long as the reaction proceeds, returning to the
baseline when the reaction reached completion and all the substrate
had been transformed into product. Rapid catalyses give rise to narrow
peaks, while slow catalyses generate broad peaks. Whereas the total
area of the peak depends on the amount of substrate injected and the
apparent enthalpy of the reaction, its shape is governed by enzyme
concentration, Michaelis–Menten parameters, rate of substrate
injection, and intrinsic calorimeter response.19,21

14(15)EET, the par excellence EpFA substrate
of hsEH,8 was used as a test compound to
demonstrate method applicability and to set up the experimental conditions
for this study. Optimization included varying concentrations of substrate
and enzyme, as well as reference power, injection speed, and spacing.
The curve obtained by injecting 14(15)EET into a solution of hsEH
CTD was negative, narrow, and deep, indicating a fast reaction (Figure 1A). The ΔHapp was calculated by integrating the area under
the peak, and the Michaelis–Menten kinetics curve fitting was
obtained by manually selecting the window between the end of the injection
(maximum substrate concentration, corresponding to saturating enzyme
conditions) and the end of the decaying portion of the injection (minimum
substrate concentration, corresponding to the beginning of the kinetics
curve; Figure 1B).
The software fitting calculates {[S]i;vi} data points through eqs 2 and 3 (Supporting Information), building a Michaelis–Menten
curve (Figure 1C),
thereby providing kcat and KM values. The catalytic efficiency (Ksp) was manually calculated as the kcat/KM ratio. In the optimal conditions,
these experiments gave a kcat of 6.64
± 1.54 s–1 and a KM of 12.88 ± 1.94 μM for the hsEH-mediated hydrolysis of
14(15)EET (Table 1).
To assess any product inhibition effect, the ΔHapp of two subsequent injections was compared: no significant
variation was observed (Figure S2A and B), demonstrating an absence of product inhibition for this hsEH CTD-mediated
hydrolysis reaction.

Kinetic Characterization of hsEH CTD-Mediated Hydrolysis of
All EETs
The experimental method and conditions optimized
for 14(15)EET were applied to analyze the hsEH CTD-catalyzed hydrolysis
of the other regioisomeric EETs. Thermal profiles and Michaelis–Menten
parameters significantly differed (Table 1). The hydrolysis of 5(6)EET generated a
very small and broad peak (Figure 2A), indicating a low ΔHapp. Although it was possible to extrapolate a kcat value of 0.35 ± 0.05 s–1 and
a KM of 46.61 ± 10.98 μM, the
error associated with this measurement was considerably greater than
for the other EETs, due to the reduced magnitude of the heat response
and the inability to reach enzyme saturation.23 Attempts to perform the experiments with higher substrate concentration
in fact resulted in precipitation of the mixture. The experiment with
8(9)EET and 11(12)EET gave a kcat of 1.28
± 0.19 s–1 and a KM of 23.10 ± 2.39 μM for the former and a kcat of 4.31 ± 0.16 s–1 and a KM of 1.74 ± 0.20 μM for the latter.
Control experiments to check for substrate autohydrolysis and product
inhibition are reported in Figures S2B and S3.

of a single-injection experiment (top plot) and the corresponding

that the faster the reaction, the fewer data points will be available
for fitting the plot.

Kinetic Characterization
of hsEH CTD-Mediated Hydrolysis of
n-3 and n-6 EpFAs
Beyond the EETs, the enzymatic activity
of hsEH toward other EpFAs was measured by ITC. We selected two EpETEs,
one EpDPE and one EpOME, to cover the chemical scaffold diversity
of hsEH substrates. Though belonging to the same chemical class, 8(9)EpETE
and 17(18)EpETE exhibited different enthalpy and kinetic values (Figure 3A and B, Table 1). The turnover rate
for the 8(9)EpETE was 1.61 ± 0.01 s–1, significantly
higher than for the 17(18)-regioisomer (0.64 ± 0.06 s–1), and its KM (9.74 ± 0.13 μM)
was almost 3 times lower than 17(18)EpETE (26.37 ± 4.05 μM).
A broad negative peak in the thermal profile was also obtained for
19(20)EpDPE, indicating a slow hsEH CTD-mediated hydrolysis (Figure 3C) described by a
turnover rate of 1.62 ± 0.08 μM and a KM of 26.60 ± 1.21 μM (Table 1). The hydrolysis of 12(13)EpOME gave rise
to a narrow heat flow profile (Figure 3D), similar to the ones observed for 11(12)- and 14(15)EET,
with a kcat of 9.65 ± 0.19 s–1 and a KM of 2.98 ±
0.56 μM. As observed with the other substrates, negligible heat
and product inhibition effects were observed in blank test injections
(Figures S2B and S4).

(top plot) and the corresponding data fit using the Michaelis–Menten
model (bottom plot). Note that for faster reactions, fewer data points
will be available for fitting the plot.

Characterization of hsEH CTD Inhibition Using ITC
We
adapted a protocol that builds on SIM ITC enzyme kinetic measurements21 to set up a versatile and continuous method
to measure the inhibitory potency of hsEH antagonists against natural
substrates, as well as readily characterize their mode of inhibition.
We evaluated the thermal power of 14(15)EET hydrolysis in the presence
of the well-known hsEH inhibitor AUDA. The enzyme was placed in the
calorimeter cell, while the syringe was loaded with a mixture of substrate
and inhibitor. A series of injections was then performed (Figure 4A). In the experiment,
AUDA accumulated in the sample cell with its concentration increasing
1-fold with each successive injection. This results in each injection
producing a heat flow response that was progressively lower and broader
than the preceding one, owing to increased hsEH CTD inhibition. Blank
test injections showed little heat effects of substrate/inhibitor
dilution into the buffer (Figure S5A).
Each peak injection was analyzed individually to measure the ΔHapp and extract the Michaelis–Menten
parameters. The kcat values derived from
each peak were identical (8.89 ± 1.64 s–1)
and in agreement with the value detected in the absence of inhibitor
(Table 1). The apparent KM (KM′) for
14(15)EET increased at every successive injection with growing inhibitor
concentration (Figure 4B). The kcat and KM′ values obtained by this analysis indicate a model
of competitive inhibition,32 which is consistent
with AUDA’s reported mode of action.26,33 As AUDA is a competitive inhibitor, the y-intercept
of the KM′ vs AUDA concentration
plot (Figure 4B) provides
the true KM,32 measured as 11.91 ± 3.43 μM, in concurrence with the
value for the 14(15)EET substrate obtained in the absence of inhibitor
(Table 1). The analysis
of the slope of the straight line fitted to the data points gives
the KM′/Ki ratio,32 providing an average Ki for AUDA of 7.62 ± 2.81 nM. This is in
excellent agreement with the value obtained from a spectrofluorimetric
assay using the synthetic substrate PHOME28,29,34 (Figure S6A and B).

14(15)EET/AUDA injections into hsEH CTD. The magnitude of the peaks

Discussion
The
study of EpFA catalysis mediated by hsEH is severely limited
by the unavailability of fast, simple, and effective methods to study
their kinetics of hydrolysis. The only technique available thus far
is a LC-MS/MS-based methodology,10 which,
although highly sensitive, is a postreaction ancillary technique,
involving multiple steps of sample manipulation and analysis,32 and requiring highly specialized equipment and
technical expertise. To develop a truly general, versatile, and rapid
enzyme kinetics assay, we have developed a single-injection ITC (SIM)
approach. By detecting the heat released or absorbed in real time
during catalysis, this technique follows reactions of native substrates
without the need of detectable changes in physicochemical properties
to track the concentration of substrate or product over time. The
single-injection ITC method yields both thermodynamic and kinetic
parameters in a single experiment. Recent advances in instrumentation,
faster response times, and analysis software (e.g. the new PEAQ-ITC analysis software) have allowed this approach
to become more user-friendly and routine. Compared to the multi-injection
ITC method counterpart, the SIM is significantly faster, requires
less enzyme, and is less subject to errors linked to baseline drift,
or other time-dependent effects, including enzyme aggregation and/or
precipitation and substrate degradation,19 because of the reduced experimental time and faster data acquisition.19,30

The ITC single-injection application presented here enables
the
rapid characterization of kinetic parameters of various natural EpFA
substrates of hsEH, such as EETs, EpETEs, EpDPEs, and EpOMEs, using
small amounts of protein and substrate, with each experiment taking
on an average 50 min (including washing and preparation of the instrument).
To our knowledge, this is the first example of the ITC SIM applied
to lipid catalysis, and it is the only method to date that allows
a quantitative analysis of hsEH-mediated hydrolysis of EpFAs in a
continuous manner.

Our investigations revealed that all EpFAs
tested could be hydrolyzed
by hsEH, albeit significant differences were observed in their kinetics
profiles, in agreement with a previous study.10 It is noteworthy that although data fitted well to the Michaelis–Menten
model, hsEH CTD performs a two-step catalysis, undergoing first the
formation of a covalent enzyme–substrate alkyl intermediate
followed by its hydrolysis.4,36 In these cases, KM values describe the concentration of the substrate
for which the catalytic rate is half maximal, instead of providing
an accurate measure of the substrate affinity for the enzyme,37 and kcat values
represent mainly the hydrolysis rate of the covalent intermediate,
given that this second step of the hsEH CTD-mediated catalysis is
at least an order of magnitude slower than the first (formation of
the alkyl covalent intermediate).4,36

Our
results (Table 1) indicate
that KM and kcat values vary significantly depending on the chemical
scaffold and the epoxide position on the fatty acid structure. Whereas
variations of KM values could not easily
be correlated with substrate properties in this study, in general kcat values were the largest when the epoxide
was central, on the carbon positions 11, 12, and 14 of the fatty acid
chain. Comparison of catalytic efficiency (Ksp), a measurement of the overall rate of the reaction and
specificity of an enzyme for a substrate,37 revealed the preferred EpFA targets for hsEH CTD, summarized in
a heatmap (Figure 5). For the substrates tested in our study, the rank order of hsEH
CTD catalytic preference is 12(13)EpOME > 11(12)EET > 14(15)EET
>
8(9)EpETE > 19(20)EpDPE ≈ 8(9)EET > 17(18)EpETE >
5(6)EET.
A trend is revealed here, correlating catalytic efficiency with the
position of the epoxide function: hsEH CTD distinctly prefers epoxides
located in the middle of the fatty acid chain, at positions 11, 12,
and 14, with its activity steadily decreasing for substrates bearing
the epoxide moiety closer to either the carboxyl acid group or to
the methyl group at the end of the hydrocarbon chain. Having the epoxide
close to the carboxyl function is the least preferred configuration,
as indicated by the lowest efficiency for 5(6)EET. This appears consistent
with the narrow “L-shaped” hsEH CTD active site, with
the catalytic triad positioned deep in the vertex and surrounded by
two large hydrophobic regions.1,6 Notably, the overall
substrate preference for sEH revealed by ITC is largely in agreement
with what was previously observed in Morisseau et al.10 by LC-MS/MS, although it is noteworthy that the discrete
Michaelis–Menten parameters do differ in the two studies (especially kcat,).

CTD-mediated hydrolysis
of EpFAs showing Ksp inverse of KM (KM–1 [μM–1]) and kcat. Colors span from gray to dark red with increasing values. Each
shade of gray-to-red indicates an increase of the 12.5th percentile
of the total interval of values. A combination of dark red shades
indicates high affinity, turnover rate, and efficiency.

Given that hsEH inhibition is a potential therapeutic approach
in a number of pathological conditions, detailed knowledge of hsEH
catalytic efficiency toward its various substrates is of great importance,
as it will inform on how such an inhibition will affect the metabolism
of several EpFAs, enabling the prediction of the expected outcome
from their altered levels. As the relative abundance of each epoxy-fatty
acid varies within the organism,10,13 a pharmacological
intervention may have simultaneous assorted responses in different
tissues and organs.

In addition to measuring the kinetics of
catalysis for different
EpFA targets of hsEH, we also devised an ITC method to screen new
hsEH inhibitors using natural substrates. Our ITC application brings
significant advantages. First, it evaluates inhibitor potency using
hsEH physiological substrates, circumventing the problems associated
with employing non-native fluorogenic compounds. This will have a
particular bearing for the analysis of noncompetitive and mixed inhibitors,
which bind respectively to the enzyme–substrate complex or
to both the enzyme and substrate.32 Interestingly,
new allosteric inhibitors of hsEH have started to emerge,34 increasing the timely relevance of this new
methodology. Furthermore, as the efficacy of noncompetitive and mixed
inhibitors may in principle differ from substrate to substrate, our
ITC method offers a well-suited solution for a systematic characterization
of inhibition versus a battery of EpFA substrates. As a second major
benefit, the ITC method allows for a straightforward characterization
of the mode of inhibition (i.e., competitive, uncompetitive
or noncompetitive/mixed),32 which is critical
to drug development as evaluating the inhibitory power, given that
it reveals the nature of the inhibited state(s).

Conclusions
Despite
the crucial biological roles of hsEH in a variety of physiological
and pathological states, a comprehensive understanding of its catalytic
activity against a compendium of natural substrates remains inadequate.
Equally, the availability of assays that characterize and screen hsEH
inhibitors using native substrates has been limited to date. We have
presented a novel, versatile, expedient, and reliable ITC SIM application
that has the potential to be adopted as the method of choice to perform
such characterizations. Being not reliant on specific physicochemical and spectroscopic properties,
our method is ideally posed to facilitate the discovery of new putative
epoxy substrates of hsEH. Moreover, calorimetric measurements can
be performed in mixtures and suspensions, e.g., in
cellular and crude tissue extracts, as well as allowing measurements
over a range of biologically relevant conditions19,38 (pH, redox conditions, salt concentration etc.), thereby having
the potential to contribute to advances of hsEH biology in health
and disease. As recent discoveries suggest a role for hsEH in redox
regulatory systems,39,40,34 our newly developed ITC method can be used to assess the impact
of the enzyme oxidative state on both catalysis and inhibition of
EpFAs hydrolysis.

Taken together, our results show the first
proof-of-concept for
kinetic characterization and inhibitor screening of hsEH activities
using ITC, an approach which is generally applicable to other enzymes
involved in lipid metabolism, and should help in the search for novel
inhibitors of this important class of enzymes.
