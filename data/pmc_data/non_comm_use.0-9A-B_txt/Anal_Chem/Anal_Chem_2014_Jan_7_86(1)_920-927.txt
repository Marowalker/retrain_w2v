Phase diagrams offer a wealth of
thermodynamic information on aqueous
mixtures of bilayer-forming lipids and micelle-forming detergents,
providing a straightforward means of monitoring and adjusting the
supramolecular state of such systems. However, equilibrium phase diagrams
are of very limited use for the reconstitution of membrane proteins
because of the occurrence of irreversible, unproductive processes
such as aggregation and precipitation that compete with productive
reconstitution. Here, we exemplify this by dissecting the effects
of the K+ channel KcsA on the process of bilayer self-assembly
in a mixture of Escherichia coli polar lipid extract
and the nonionic detergent octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside.
Even at starting concentrations in the low micromolar range, KcsA
has a tremendous impact on the supramolecular organization of the
system, shifting the critical lipid/detergent ratios at the onset
and completion of vesicle formation by more than 2-fold. Thus, equilibrium
phase diagrams obtained for protein-free lipid/detergent mixtures
would be misleading when used to guide the reconstitution process.
To address this issue, we demonstrate that, even under such nonequilibrium
conditions, high-sensitivity isothermal titration calorimetry can
be exploited to monitor the progress of membrane-protein reconstitution
in real time, in a noninvasive manner, and at high resolution to yield
functional proteoliposomes with a narrow size distribution for further
downstream applications.

Integral
membrane proteins (IMPs)
play key roles in many physiological processes and account for more
than half of all drug targets.1 Most approaches
to IMPs depend on detergents, which serve as disintegrators of cellular
membranes and as dispersing agents during purification and biochemical,
biophysical, or structural analyses.2−4 However, vectorial IMP
functions such as signaling and transport can be studied only in the
context of a membrane that separates two aqueous compartments.5 The most popular model environments for investigating
such functions are lipid bilayers, which mimic the most essential
features of biological membranes.6 Even
in cases where vectorial properties are irrelevant, protein incorporation
into bilayer membranes is desirable because these provide a more native-like
environment than detergent micelles.7 Thus,
purified IMPs need to be reconstituted from a detergent-solubilized
state into a well-defined and controllable bilayer system,8,9 which may be achieved by addition of lipid followed by dilution10 or detergent removal through dialysis,5 gel filtration chromatography,11 hydrophobic adsorption,12 or
complexation.13 Irrespective of the method
used, reconstitution is often an intractable, lengthy trial-and-error
procedure.14 On the premise that the development
of more efficient and rational reconstitution strategies could benefit
from a better understanding and control of the self-assembly process
resulting in proteoliposomes, the complex interplay among IMPs, lipids,
and detergents has been analyzed in considerable detail.2−17 Since proteoliposomes for functional assays are usually produced
at rather low protein densities, the behavior of protein/lipid/detergent
mixtures might be expected to be dominated by the properties of the
lipid and the detergent,8 whose interactions
therefore have been the subject of particular scrutiny.18

The supramolecular assemblies in mixtures
of bilayer-forming lipids
and micelle-forming detergents can be approximated as pseudophases,19 whose prevalence as a function of composition
is captured in a phase diagram (see below). In the simplest case,
two ranges featuring either micelles or bilayer structures are separated
from one another by a coexistence range.20 At a given detergent concentration, two thresholds referred to as
the solubilization (SOL) and saturation (SAT) boundaries indicate
the lipid concentrations at which bilayer formation sets in and is
completed, respectively. Phase diagrams provide fundamental insights
into lipid/detergent interactions21 and
have practical applications by enabling tight control of the supramolecular
state of, for instance, lipidic drug-delivery systems.22 Their relevance to IMP reconstitution draws
from the observation that the reconstitution success depends on the
phase ranges explored during proteoliposome formation.8,9,15−17 For example,
while several nonionic detergents with sugar-based headgroups can
catalyze IMP insertion without requiring vesicle dissolution, Triton
and cholate depend on partial or complete solubilization, respectively,
before efficient reconstitution can be initiated.9 Thus, knowledge of the pertinent lipid/detergent phase
diagram should be expected to be a promising starting point for a
judicious approach to IMP reconstitution.23

In practice, however, the wealth of physicochemical data collected
on numerous lipid/detergent combinations18 is seldom exploited for the optimization of solubilization and reconstitution
protocols for IMPs24 because such efforts
are frustrated by the finding that proteins themselves may change
the supramolecular behavior of the system.10,25,26 In part, this might be due to a direct influence
on the partition equilibrium between micellar and bilayer structures,
which is particularly relevant for IMP solubilization from protein-rich
membranes after overexpression26 or for
reconstitution at high protein densities required for 2D crystallization.10,25 However, even much lower protein concentrations typical of functional
reconstitution may render phase diagrams of simple lipid/detergent
systems futile. This is because IMP reconstitution is, in the vast
majority of cases, a kinetically rather than a thermodynamically controlled
process, as productive reconstitution is almost never complete but
competes with unproductive reactions, namely, aggregation and precipitation.27−29 These irreversible processes render IMP reconstitution hard to control
and, more specifically, result not only in a loss of protein but also
in a reduction of the actual concentrations of lipid and detergent,
thus rendering useless any phase diagram based on nominal concentrations.
These problems are further exacerbated by the scarcity of noninvasive
methods capable of monitoring the progress of a reconstitution experiment
in real time.

For simple lipid/detergent systems, isothermal
titration calorimetry
(ITC) is an excellent technique for following vesicle solubilization
and reconstitution,20,21 offering unique accuracy, resolution,
and sensitivity as well as robustness against light scattering and
other experimental issues. Here, we demonstrate the dramatic extent
to which phase diagrams of lipid/detergent mixtures may be misleading
during IMP reconstitution and establish ITC as a powerful, label-free
online method for following proteoliposome assembly even under nonequilibrium
conditions. This is exemplified for the reconstitution of the channel
protein KcsA30 from the nonionic detergent
octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (OG) into vesicles made from Escherichia coli polar lipid extract. KcsA is a homotetrameric
K+ channel that was key to elucidating the mechanism of
selective K+ transport31 and
is also involved in ultrafast water transport.29,32 We chose KcsA because (i) it is a robust IMP that can be produced
in amounts sufficient for extensive in vitro experiments,31,33 (ii) its channel activity and thus successful reconstitution can
easily be confirmed,34 and (iii) it has
proven useful as a model to test reconstitution protocols.35−37 In spite of these advantageous properties, reconstitution yields
are typically low, and protein aggregation is common during reconstitution,28,29 rendering KcsA a more representative example than the few IMPs that
seem to incorporate into proteoliposomes almost quantitatively.38E. coli polar lipid extract
and OG lend themselves for the reconstitution of bacterial IMPs, and
the thermodynamics of solubilization and reconstitution of this system
in the absence of protein has been characterized in detail.39

Experimental Section
Protein Production and
Purification
A pQE-60 plasmid
containing the KcsA gene was kindly provided by Prof. Roderick MacKinnon
(Rockefeller University). The KcsA sequence was cloned into a pET-30
Ek/LIC expression vector (Merck-Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), yielding
a DNA construct encoding a fusion protein comprising a hexahistidine
tag, a 44-residue spacer, and KcsA residues 1–160 (ref (40)). For fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy (FCS), serine at position 6 was mutated to cysteine using
a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, USA). Published
protocols31,33 were adapted for KcsA production and purification.
Overexpression was done in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS
cells, which were grown at 37 °C for 6 h and at 30 °C for
another 18 h. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer (10 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4, 150 mM KF, 10
mM imidazole, pH 8.0), disrupted in a high-pressure homogenizer (Avestin,
Mannheim, Germany), and incubated with 40 mM decyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (Glycon Biochemicals, Luckenwalde, Germany) on a
shaker at 4 °C for 2 h. The cell suspension was centrifuged at
50 000g and 4 °C for 30 min, and the
supernatant was subjected to immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography
(Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany). Detergent exchange into 80 mM OG (Glycon
Biochemicals) and adjustment to pH 7.1 were performed on a P-6 desalting
column (Bio-Rad). For fluorescent labeling of the S6C mutant, we applied
minor modifications to a published protocol41 as described.29 Final KcsA and OG concentrations
were determined by, respectively, spectrophotometry and thin-layer
chromatography.42

Vesicle Preparation and
Characterization
The molar
mass of E. coli polar lipid extract (Avanti Polar
Lipids, Alabaster, USA) was taken as 700 g/mol.43 Lipid powder was dissolved in buffer (10 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4, 150 mM KF, pH 7.1) to
a final concentration of 50 mM by vortexing for 15 min. For FCS, E. coli polar lipid extract was supplemented with 0.01%
(w/w) N-(lissamine
rhodamine B sulfonyl)phosphatidylethanolamine (Rh-PE). The lipid suspension
was sonicated for 40 min in a Sonopuls HD 2070 homogenizer (Bandelin
electronic, Berlin, Germany). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was done
on a Zetasizer NanoSZ (Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK) equipped
with a 50 mW laser emitting at 532 nm and a detector mounted at an
angle of 173°. Measurements were performed on protein- and detergent-free
lipid vesicles after sonication, on protein/lipid/detergent mixtures
immediately after reconstitution, and on proteoliposomes after subsequent
removal of aggregates and residual OG by dilution of the mixture recovered
from the ITC cell, ultracentrifugation at 160 000g and 8 °C for 1 h, resuspension of the pellet in buffer, and
extrusion through two, 100 nm polycarbonate filters (Avestin, Ottawa,
Canada). Only monoexponential autocorrelation functions characteristic
of narrow size distributions were subjected to cumulants analysis44 to obtain the Z-average size
and the second-order polydispersity index and were used to derive
intensity-weighted size distribution functions.

Isothermal
Titration Calorimetry
ITC was carried out
on VP-ITC and iTC200 calorimeters (GE Healthcare) after
gentle degassing. Reconstitution was accomplished by titrating 1.5
μM KcsA tetramer solubilized in 30–35 mM OG with 20–50
mM sonicated E. coli polar lipid extract. Injection
volumes and stirring speeds were, respectively, 1.5–3 μL
and 307 rpm on the VP-ITC and 0.4 μL and 1000 rpm on the iTC200. Automated baseline adjustment and peak integration were
done with the public-domain software NITPIC45 to yield normalized reaction heats as a function of lipid concentration.
Solubilization and saturation boundaries were derived from the inflection
points in these isotherms with the aid of nonlinear least-squares
fitting.46

Fluorescence Correlation
Spectroscopy
FCS was performed
on an LSM 510 META ConfoCor 3 (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped
with avalanche photodiodes. A 20 μL sample containing Atto 488-labeled
KcsA reconstituted by stepwise addition of rhodamine-labeled vesicles
and further processed by dilution, ultracentrifugation, and extrusion
as described above was transferred onto a coverslip, and fluorescence
signals were acquired at 25 °C for 20 s; 488 nm and 633 nm lasers
were used to independently monitor the diffusion characteristics of
fluorescently labeled protein and lipid, respectively. Each temporal
signal was autocorrelated independently, and autocorrelation functions
from quadruplicate experiments were averaged and analyzed using standard
models for free 3D-diffusion.47 633 nm
traces were fitted with a single component; to account for small amounts
of unbound Atto 488 dye, 488 nm autocorrelation functions were analyzed
using two components, the diffusion time of one of which was fixed
at 0.03 ms. The numbers of proteoliposomes or micelles containing
Atto 488-labeled KcsA in the confocal volume were derived from the
amplitudes of the autocorrelation functions and were used to calculate
the number of KcsA tetramers per proteoliposome, as detailed elsewhere.29

Activity Assay
Free-standing planar
lipid membranes
were formed according to an established protocol.48 Lipid was dissolved in n-decane to a final
concentration of 20 mg/mL and was spread across a circular aperture
with a diameter of 100–120 μm in a polytetrafluoroethylene
septum separating two compartments filled with buffer (10 mM HEPES,
100 or 150 mM KCl, pH 4.0). The transmembrane current was measured
with Ag/AgCl electrodes and an Axon GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, USA) under voltage-clamp conditions. The recording
filter was a 4-pole Bessel with a 3-dB corner frequency of 500 Hz.
Gaussian filters of 117 Hz were applied to reduce noise. The amplified
signal was digitized by a PCI 6025E computer board (National Instruments,
Munich, Germany) and analyzed with WinEDR (Strathclyde Electrophysiology
Software, Strathclyde, UK). The protein/lipid/detergent mixture recovered
from the ITC cell was diluted to 10 mM OG, incubated at 8 °C
for 1 h, and ultracentrifuged at 100 000g and
8 °C for 1.5 h. The pellet was washed with buffer, recentrifuged
for 1 h, and resuspended in buffer to reach a lipid concentration
of 10 mg/mL; 1–2 μL of proteoliposome suspension was
injected into the cis compartment, followed by membrane rupture and
formation of a new membrane. To increase incorporation efficacy, 250
mM urea was added to the cis side. The current was monitored at a
holding voltage of 100–150 mV.

Results
To shed
light on the influence of an IMP on the self-assembly of
a lipid/detergent mixture, we used ITC to monitor the reconstitution
of KcsA from an OG-solubilized state into proteoliposomes and compared
it with the transformation of protein-free micelles into bilayer vesicles.

Reconstitution
of Protein-Free Vesicles from a Micellar Solution
Figure 1a depicts an ITC experiment in which
vesicles composed of 50 mM E. coli polar lipid extract
were titrated into 35 mM OG, above the detergent’s critical
micellar concentration of 29.6 mM.39 The
first injections gave rise to endothermic, smoothly decaying heat
signals, which reflected the dissolution of injected vesicles and
the incorporation of lipid into mixed micelles. The SOL boundary was
reached at a lipid concentration of 3.1 mM, where the micelles became
saturated with lipid. Further titration led to the appearance of detergent-saturated
bilayer vesicles coexisting with lipid-saturated micelles. Throughout
this coexistence range, the reaction heats remained uniform because
each injection entailed transfer of a constant amount of lipid and
detergent from micelles into vesicles. The SAT boundary at 7.2 mM
lipid was marked by a sharp rise in the heat of reaction, indicating
the disappearance of micellar structures. Beyond this point, the calorimetric
signal smoothly decreased as the lipid concentration rose, thus reducing
the difference in composition between newly injected pure lipid vesicles
and mixed vesicles in the cell. We have previously performed such
reconstitution experiments on E. coli polar lipid
extract/OG mixtures over a range of lipid and detergent concentrations.39 Solubilization experiments corresponding to
reverse titrations of micelles into vesicles could confirm that this
system is under thermodynamic control, allowing for an equilibrium
phase diagram to be constructed (cf. Figure 3 below).39

of 1.5 μM KcsA tetramer at 8 °C. Both isotherms depict
the heats of reaction, Q (circles), obtained upon
titration of 35 mM OG with 50 mM E. coli polar lipid
extract. Also shown are the SOL and SAT boundaries (red and blue lines,
respectively) and the uncertainty in the SAT boundary in the presence
of KcsA (light blue band). Inset: Thermogram displaying differential
heating power, Δp, versus time, t. The discontinuity at t ≈ 10 h is due to
an increase in injection volume.

Membrane-Protein Reconstitution by Titration Calorimetry
The isotherm in Figure 1b was obtained by
repeating the above reconstitution titration in the presence of 1.5
μM KcsA tetramer in the calorimeter cell under otherwise identical
conditions. Even though the overall shape was reminiscent of the protein-free
system, the presence of KcsA at a low concentration affected the detailed
form of the trace and resulted in substantial quantitative differences.
Most notably, both inflection points were shifted to much lower lipid
concentrations, with the SOL and SAT boundaries appearing at 0.9 and
3.3 mM lipid, respectively. While the transition from the micellar
range to the coexistence range at the SOL boundary was as sharp as
it was in the absence of protein, the transition from the coexistence
range to the bilayer range broadened in the presence of KcsA, thus
creating some leeway in the determination of the SAT boundary. To
quantitatively account for this uncertainty, we considered the lipid
concentration range over which the first derivative of the isotherm
did not deviate significantly from its maximum value and propagated
its lower and upper bounds through all subsequent analyses (see below).

To follow the transition from micellar to vesicular protein/lipid/detergent
assemblies systematically, we performed ITC reconstitution titrations
in the presence of KcsA at various lipid and detergent concentrations,
as summarized in Figure 2. While the major
hallmarks discussed above were preserved across all thermograms and
isotherms, the initial detergent and lipid concentrations used to,
respectively, solubilize and reconstitute KcsA were found to have
a pronounced influence on the location of the SOL and SAT boundaries.

20 mM lipid into 32.5 mM OG. (e) 20 mM lipid into 30 mM OG. Discontinuities
in thermogram amplitudes are due to changes in injection volume. See
Figure 1 for details.

Influence of KcsA on Bilayer Formation
Figure 3 depicts the critical
lipid/detergent concentration pairs measured in the presence of 1.5
μM KcsA tetramer (Figures 1 and 2) as coordinates in a phase diagram for protein-free E. coli lipid/OG mixtures.39 This
phase diagram is characterized by two straight lines separating the
coexistence range from the purely micellar and vesicular ranges. The
SOL boundary corresponds to a critical OG/E. coli lipid ratio of RDm,SOL =
3.1, while the SAT boundary is given by RDb,SAT = 0.95. These values indicate that, in the absence
of protein, micelles contain at least a 3-fold molar excess of OG
over lipid, whereas bilayer vesicles can accommodate up to one OG
molecule per lipid molecule. The lipid/detergent concentration pairs
now obtained in the presence of KcsA do not fall onto these equilibrium
phase boundaries, as linear regression would yield critical OG/E. coli lipid ratios of 9.7 and 2.2 for the onset and completion
of reconstitution, respectively. However, it is important to realize
that these values do not, in general, correspond to the actual compositions
of the protein/lipid/detergent assemblies because, in the presence
of protein, the axes in Figure 3 do not reflect
the actual concentrations of lipid and detergent in solution or suspension
but rather indicate their nominal concentrations.

concentration pairs in the presence of
KcsA (open symbols and dotted lines) and phase diagram of E. coli polar lipid extract and OG (colored areas) at 8
°C. Experimental data from Figures 1 and 2 (red triangles and blue circles) and linear regressions

boundaries in the presence of 1.5 μM KcsA tetramer. Also shown
are the micellar, coexistence, and vesicular ranges for protein-free E. coli polar lipid extract/OG mixtures39 (red, white, and blue hatched areas, respectively), the
uncertainties in the SAT boundary in the presence of protein (blue
error bars), and the trajectory of the titration depicted in Figure 1b (dashed arrow).

Particle Size Distributions before and after Reconstitution
To confirm that the calorimetric signatures observed upon titration
of OG-solubilized KcsA with E. coli polar lipid (Figures 1 and 2) were indeed indicative
of the formation of vesicles, we determined hydrodynamic particle
diameters both before and after ITC-monitored reconstitution with
the aid of DLS. As exemplified in Figure 4a,
sonicated E. coli polar lipid vesicles in the absence
of protein and detergent yielded monoexponential autocorrelation functions
characteristic of narrow size distributions, whereas crude reconstitution
mixtures recovered from the calorimeter cell revealed complex autocorrelation
functions reflecting the presence of larger aggregates. However, removal
of aggregates and residual OG by dilution, ultracentrifugation, and
extrusion afforded proteoliposomes with well-defined size distributions,
as evidenced in Figure 4b. Cumulants analysis44 returned a Z-average size of
(140 ± 10) nm and a second-order polydispersity index of 0.16
± 0.03 for proteoliposomes as compared with values of, respectively,
(70 ± 5) nm and 0.17 ± 0.02 for sonicated E. coli polar lipid vesicles before reconstitution. Thus, the final, detergent-free
proteoliposomes were about twice as large as the pure lipid vesicles
used as starting material but had a similarly narrow, unimodal size
distribution.

distribution functions, f(d), of
the hydrodynamic diameter, d, of sonicated E. coli polar lipid vesicles before reconstitution (black)

Protein Incorporation and Reconstitution
Yield
To quantify
the reconstitution yield and verify that both the protein and the
lipid were coreconstituted, we tracked the fates of both components
using FCS.29,47 For this purpose, we produced
a cysteine mutant (S6C) of KcsA labeled with the fluorophore Atto
488 and prepared E. coli polar lipid vesicles supplemented
with 0.01% (w/w) Rh-PE as a lipidic
fluorescent probe. Titrations of OG-solubilized KcsA(S6C) with labeled
vesicles were stopped after the SAT boundary, and aggregates as well
as OG were removed by dilution, ultracentrifugation, and extrusion.
The autocorrelation functions in Figure 5a
were measured independently for the two fluorophores by exciting Atto
488-labeled KcsA(S6C) at 488 nm and Rh-PE at 633 nm, revealing that
both existed as single populations with identical diffusion times
of 3.05 ms. Resolubilization of proteoliposomes gave rise to a single
population having a diffusion time of 0.17 ms characteristic of micelles.
Comparison of autocorrelation amplitudes before and after resolubilization29 revealed that the average number of KcsA tetramers
per proteoliposome was 2.8 ± 0.5. Generally, this ratio assumed
values of 1–4,29 depending on the
initial detergent concentration and the amount of lipid added.

reconstitution. (a) FCS autocorrelation functions, G(τ), versus delay time, τ, before and after resolubilization

from proteoliposomes into planar membranes composed of E.
coli polar lipid extract. pH 4.0 on both sides, voltage as
indicated.

Protein Activity after
Reconstitution
Single-channel
experiments corroborated that KcsA not only incorporated into proteoliposomes
but also regained its native activity. To this end, we removed aggregates
and residual OG by dilution and ultracentrifugation, transferred KcsA
into planar lipid membranes,49 and measured
the transmembrane flux of K+ ions. As shown in Figure 5b, inward and outward transport was observed with
voltage dependencies characteristic of KcsA.34 Other hallmarks of KcsA were also confirmed, including a prolonged
lifetime of the open state and the ensuing simultaneous opening of
several channels upon increasing the content of anionic lipid (Figure
S1a, Supporting Information),50 unilateral or complete inactivation upon shifting
to pH 7.0 on, respectively, one or both sides of the membrane (Figure
S1b,c, Supporting Information),34 and a reduction in the open-channel amplitude
and the opening frequency by tetraethylammonium (Figure S1d, Supporting Information).34

Discussion
Efforts have been made to rationalize and
optimize the reconstitution
of IMPs by elucidating the influence of lipids and detergents8−17 and experimental parameters such as the rate of detergent extraction8 or the permeability of the bilayer.21,51 By contrast, only little attention is usually paid to the role of
the IMP itself. Besides the large amounts of protein required for
such systematic investigation, the prime reason for this most likely
lies in the assumption that the low protein/lipid ratios commonly
employed for functional reconstitution justify treatment of an IMP
as an “infinitely diluted solute having almost no influence
on the detergent and lipid interactions”.8 The present findings demonstrate that this assumption does
not generally hold.

Experimental Challenges during Membrane-Protein
Reconstitution
Our experimental conditions29 afford
reconstitution yields of 10–20%. For instance, with an average
of 3 KcsA channels per proteoliposome (Figure 5a) having a diameter of 140 nm (Figure 4b)
and assuming a surface area requirement of 0.7 nm2 per
lipid molecule, we arrive at a molar ratio of lipid to KcsA tetramer
of ∼60 000. For a final lipid concentration of 9 mM
(Figure 1b), this translates to a channel concentration
of 0.15 μM, that is, 10% of the initial concentration. Correcting
for dilution effects results in a yield of ∼12%. Although such
low yields still enable protein densities largely sufficient for functional
assays (Figure 5b), they entail two adverse
consequences for proteoliposome formation: on the one hand, unproductive
reactions competing with reconstitution make phase diagrams for lipid/detergent
mixtures (Figure 3) futile in predicting the
reconstitution progress; on the other hand, aggregation (Figure 4a) is a serious obstacle to the application of turbidimetry
and light scattering methods for following the reconstitution process.

Ideally, a plot of critical lipid/detergent concentration pairs
such as the one in Figure 3 would have to be
established for the protein/lipid/detergent system of interest under
the specific conditions used for IMP reconstitution. In the case of
KcsA, the most likely explanation for the shifts observed for the
SOL and the SAT boundaries is that aggregation reduces not only the
protein yield but also the “active” OG concentration,
that is, the detergent fraction that can be transferred from micelles
into bilayers during the reconstitution process. Applying systematic
reconstitution experiments to a more extensive set of proteins differing
in hydrophobicity, size, structure, and topology might afford deeper
insights into the underlying molecular determinants. In most cases,
however, such an approach would be hampered by the prohibitively high
sample requirements of usually precious target protein, emphasizing
the need for more practical, online protocols that can be used without
previous knowledge of the pertinent SOL and SAT boundaries.

Monitoring
Membrane-Protein Reconstitution in Real Time by Titration
Calorimetry
In the absence of general rules, a single calorimetrically
monitored reconstitution titration such as the one in Figure 1b can be exploited to follow a reconstitution trial
in real time and in a label-free and noninvasive manner to yield functional
proteoliposomes. If the experiment aims at maximum yield, titration
with lipid vesicles has to be continued until the SAT boundary is
crossed. Stopping the titration earlier would mean sacrificing protein
because of the persistence of micelles, whereas addition of more lipid
would dilute the proteoliposome sample with protein-free vesicles.
If, by contrast, the focus is on increasing protein density, proteoliposomes
should be harvested upon halting the titration after the SOL boundary.
The approach does not depend on prior knowledge of concentrations
or phase diagrams and, unlike other sophisticated ways of monitoring
IMP reconstitution,25 does not require
diagnostic sample removal during the titration.

ITC has proven
exceptionally useful for quantifying composition-dependent phenomena
in aqueous surfactant solutions,52 including
membrane solubilization and reconstitution,20,21 partitioning and translocation,51,53 permeabilization,54 and curvature strain.55 The present results show that high-sensitivity ITC can be applied
also to more complex systems comprising protein, lipid, and detergent
under conditions where irreversible processes impede the application
of rigorous formalisms established for equilibrated systems of known
concentrations.20,21,51−55 Calorimetry offers a number of advantages over other methods traditionally
employed to monitor IMP reconstitution. Light scattering and turbidimetry
are insensitive to the disappearance of micelles and thus fail in
detecting the SAT boundary. Moreover, because these methods often
cannot distinguish vesicles from rodlike micelles or aggregates, they
may also lead to erroneous conclusions with respect to the location
of the SOL boundary. ITC suffers from neither of these problems because
it is sensitive to changes in supramolecular organization
(e.g., the appearance of bilayers or the disappearance of micelles)
rather than to properties indicative of the existence of certain types of assemblies (e.g., hydrodynamic size). Even if
additional information may be required to interpret or confirm calorimetric
data, ITC quickly and reliably yields high-resolution information
on the concentrations at which major changes in the supramolecular
organization of the reconstitution mixture occur and which therefore
warrant further investigation.

Conclusions
The
strong influence of KcsA on the assembly of bilayer membranes
suggests that lipid/detergent phase diagrams are poor guides for the
functional reconstitution of membrane proteins. To our knowledge,
no other quantitative data on protein-containing systems are currently
available, but it is safe to assume that different proteins and experimental
conditions will influence reconstitution to various extents. In the
absence of such data, we exemplify how reconstitution experiments
can be monitored in real time with the aid of high-sensitivity calorimetry,
which is independent of spectroscopic or radiolabels and compatible
with turbid or heterogeneous samples. Since the reaction heat stems
mostly from lipid/detergent interactions, the method also should not
depend on the type and concentration of protein. In the future, this
approach shall be adapted to related applications such as membrane
solubilization26 and 2D crystallization,10,25 where higher protein densities suggest such effects to be even more
prominent.
