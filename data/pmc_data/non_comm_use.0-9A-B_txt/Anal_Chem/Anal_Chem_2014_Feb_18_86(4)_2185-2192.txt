Intact protein characterization using
mass spectrometry thus far
has been achieved at the cost of throughput. Presented here is the
application of 193 nm ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) for top
down identification and characterization of proteins in complex mixtures
in an online fashion. Liquid chromatographic separation at the intact
protein level coupled with fast UVPD and high-resolution detection
resulted in confident identification of 46 unique sequences compared
to 44 using HCD from prepared Escherichia coli ribosomes.
Importantly, nearly all proteins identified in both the UVPD and optimized
HCD analyses demonstrated a substantial increase in confidence in
identification (as defined by an average decrease in E value of ∼40 orders of magnitude) due to the higher number
of matched fragment ions. Also shown is the potential for high-throughput
characterization of intact proteins via liquid chromatography (LC)–UVPD-MS
of molecular weight-based fractions of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae lysate. In total, protein products from 215 genes were identified
and found in 292 distinct proteoforms, 168 of which contained some
type of post-translational modification.

==== Body
Proteomic
analysis using mass
spectrometry (MS) can be divided into three distinct approaches, termed
(in order of increasing polypeptide mass) bottom up, middle down,
and top down. The vast majority of biological samples are interrogated
using bottom up methods, which use robust collision-based fragmentation
methods to sequence the small peptides that result from tryptic digestion.1 Middle down methods exploit more restricted proteases
or chemical methods that are specific for a single amino acid or less
commonly observed primary sequence motif to create peptides that are
generally larger than those produced using bottom up methods.2−5 The interest in middle down methods is motivated by the fact that
as polypeptide mass increases, so does the resulting sequence coverage
from each identification. Finally, top down methods lack a proteolytic
step and are able to correlate observed deviations from the theoretical
intact mass for a more accurate picture of the biologically relevant
proteoform.6 Each of these approaches has
its own drawbacks and benefits. Because of the ease of separation,
ionization, and detection of small peptides, bottom up methods provide
unparalleled throughput in terms of identification, but the relative
fraction of characterized protein sequence from each identification
is typically far lower than the other two methods. Middle down methods
result in higher sequence coverage but require higher resolution detection
of both the precursor and product ions for accurate charge state deconvolution.4

Top down methods lack a proteolytic step
and exploit high accuracy
precursor and product ion masses for comparison to the expected translated
sequences.7 This measurement provides immediate
feedback on post translational modifications (PTMs) that may or may
not be present in the analyzed sample. Agreement in precursor mass
between theoretical and observed measurements constitutes a major
leap forward toward characterizing the identified protein, as opposed
to just confirming its presence. Several groups have demonstrated
nearly complete characterization of intact proteins, but the analyses
are typically targeted, single protein infusion type experiments.8−11 Thus far, high-throughput top down analysis of complex mixtures
has rarely been reported, with a few exceptions.12,13 While impressive results in terms of the total number of identified
proteins have been achieved, fully characterizing each identified
protein remains a substantial challenge that has not been surmounted
by collision induced dissociation (CID), electron capture dissociation
(ECD), or electron transfer dissociation (ETD) methods. The high mass
accuracy product ion measurements achieved in top down experiments
provide an impressive level of specificity, requiring relatively few
matching fragments for a positive identification.14 Top down search algorithms have capitalized on this by
allowing expanded precursor mass tolerances that can accommodate unforeseen
PTMs and mass shifts (including subtractive modifications like sequence
truncations or incorrect start sites).15,16 This search
strategy can readily identify proteins whose masses differ significantly
from the translated sequence. While confirmation of a PTM’s
presence on a given protein is an important achievement by itself,
its localization and relative quantitation on the matched sequence
is an ultimate goal. Although top down proteomic methods provide a
large amount of information, the analytical challenges associated
with their implementation (i.e., requiring satisfactory chromatography
and high-resolution MS measurements on a liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS) time scale) are significant impediments
to its widespread adoption in the field. This requirement limits practitioners
to Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR), Orbitrap, or
high resolution time-of-flight (TOF) instruments. For the former two
platforms, resolution is proportional to transient acquisition time,
and since high-resolution measurements are required for both precursor
and their highly charged product ions, longer duty cycles result in
decreased throughput. In addition to the fundamental difficulty in
high-resolution detection, proteins and large biomolecules produce
charge state distributions that clutter the spectral landscape while
simultaneously diluting the total ion current. Indeed, computational
studies have demonstrated that this is the single largest detriment
to sensitivity in intact protein MS.17 All
of these challenges are encountered even before facing the difficulties
in activation and fragmentation. Currently, the majority of top down
proteomics identifications are the result of some variation of threshold
fragmentation (either collision induced dissociation (CID), higher
energy CID (HCD), or nozzle skimmer18/prefolding19 dissociation (NSD)). These robust methods are
widely applicable across a large range of polypeptide sizes but suffer
from several shortcomings. Generally, as polypeptide length increases,
collision-based methods result in fewer and fewer fragments that are
representative of the middle region of the protein sequence.20 Additionally, these threshold fragmentation
methods cleave the weakest bonds first, resulting in a bias toward
Xxx-Pro and Glu-Xxx/Asp-Xxx bonds21 and
the preferential cleavage of labile PTMs (such as phosphorylation
and sulfation).

We recently reported the performance metrics
of ultraviolet photodissociation
(UVPD) for individual proteins up to 29 kDa by direct infusion,22 thus motivating our effort to evaluate UVPD
for LC–MS workflows. Presented here is a comparison of 193
nm ultraviolet photodissociation to collision-based methods for fragmentation
of protein ions in a high-throughput format using the Escherichia
coli ribosome and the fractionated Saccharomyces
cerevisiae proteome as models. Ribosomes are the molecular
machines responsible for translation of mRNA into functional proteins
and their constituent protein complement serves as an ideal yardstick
for method comparison due to its relative simplicity (∼56 proteins
in E. coli), generally small size amenable to top
down MS analysis, high average isoelectric point, and stoichiometric
abundance. Previous methods analyzing ribosomes from various organisms
have achieved success using a variety of approaches.4,23,24 Ribosomal proteins constitute
a large proportion of the proteins identified in top down experiments
due to both their high abundance relative to the basal proteome during
normal growth conditions and high ionization efficiency in positive
polarity (stemming from the high average isoelectric point).25 For the present comparative study, ribosomes
isolated from E. coli for in vitro translation of mRNA transcripts were analyzed using both collision
based (HCD) and UV photodissociation methods.

Materials and Methods
High-Throughput
UVPD Optimization
Horse myoglobin,
β-lactoglobulin, and β- casein were acquired from Sigma
Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Model proteins (10 μM) were prepared
in 50/49/1 acetonitrile/water/formic acid (v/v/v). Proteins were infused
at 5 μL/min. In order to determine the optimal laser conditions
for UVPD, either one or two laser pulses was used and the laser power
was varied from 0.5 to 3.0 mJ/pulse. Product ion spectra were acquired
with 1, 3, and 5 averaged scans at three different resolution settings.
This optimization resulted in the selection of a single 2.5 mJ pulse
with three scans averaged for the LC–UVPD-MS experiments.

Ribosomal Preparation
E. coli ribosomes
were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Nucleic acids
were precipitated from solution following the method of Hardy et al.26 Briefly, 0.25 volumes of Mg(OAc)2 and one volume of glacial acetic acid were added to the ribosome
suspension. The solution was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h prior
to centrifugation to pellet the rRNA using a benchtop centrifuge.
The samples were then neutralized via buffer exchange into 25 mM NH4HCO3 using 3 kDa molecular weight cutoff filters
(Millipore, Billerica, MA). The ribosomal proteins were then reduced
by addition of dithiothreitol to 5 mM and incubation at 55 °C
for 30 min. Alkylation was performed in the dark for 30 min with 5
mM iodoacetamide. Proteins were injected directly without further
manipulation.

Yeast Lysate Preparation and GELFREE Fractionation
S. cerevisiae BY4742 were grown at 30 °C
and
harvested during log-phase growth (OD600 0.7). Cells were
lysed by boiling in a buffer comprised of 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS), 5% glycerol, 50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 50 mM Tris (pH
7.5) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Halt inhibitor
cocktail, ThermoPierce, Rockford, IL). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation
(7000g, 5 min) prior to protein quantification using
the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA, ThermoPierce, Rockford, IL). Protein
(400 μg) was prepared for GELFrEE by acetone precipitation followed
by resuspension in GELFrEE loading buffer, DTT, and water per manufacturer’s
instructions (Expedeon, Cambridgeshire, U.K., GELFREE 8100). After
separation, fractions were precipitated27 from their 0.1% SDS containing buffer and resuspended in aqueous
solvent containing formic acid.

LC–UVPD-MS/MS
Reduced and alkylated ribosomes
(3.8 pmol) were loaded onto a C4 trap column and subsequently eluted
onto a 40 cm C4 analytical column packed in house with 5 μm
particles containing 300 Å pores (Bruker-Michrom, Auburn, CA).
Mobile phase A was 0.1% aqueous formic acid, and mobile phase B was
0.1% formic acid (v/v) in acetonitrile. Proteins were eluted using
a 90 min gradient with a linear increase to 15% eluent B in the first
10 min followed by an increase to 60% eluent B over the next 80 min
at 300 nL/min. Proteins eluted directly off of the column into a Thermo
Scientific Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Bremen, Germany) customized
to accommodate photodissociation (previously described elsewhere).22,28 Briefly, a flange containing a CaF2 window was installed
on the back of the Orbitrap in line with the center of the HCD collision
cell. A 193 nm ArF excimer laser (Coherent ExciStar XS) was synchronized
to initiate a single 2.5 mJ, and a 5 ns pulse at 500 Hz as the targeted
ion cloud was transferred into the HCD cell. For ribosomal analyses,
MS1 spectra were acquired at 240k resolving power (at m/z 400) and product ion spectra after UVPD were
acquired for the top three most abundant precursors by averaging three
scans at 240k resolving power. For all analyses, the HCD cell pressure
was reduced to ∼2 mTorr (relative to the standard HCD cell
operating pressure of 10 mTorr) which decreased the pressure in the
Orbitrap mass analyzer and thus enhanced the detection of low abundance
and larger fragment ions.

Data Processing
RAW files were deconvoluted
using the
Xtract algorithm embedded in a custom version of ProSightPC 3.0, modified
ad hoc to accommodate all of the product ion types encountered in
UVPD.22 The Poisson-based P-Score model
was adjusted, as needed, to accommodate the additional ion types.
Ribosomal analyses were searched against both a forward and decoy
custom database (170 candidate sequences) of ribosomal proteins using
a 1000 Da precursor mass tolerance and a 10 ppm product ion tolerance
in delta M mode. Yeast fractions were searched against forward and
decoy versions of a preannotated yeast database (1 196 890
candidate sequences) with a 2.2 Da precursor mass tolerance and a
10 ppm product ion tolerance without using delta M mode. All searches
were conducted to accommodate the nine major UVPD ion types (a, a + 1, b, c, x, x + 1, y, y – 1, and z)29 unless otherwise noted. Fragment ions were matched within
a single spectrum for each precursor and its associated set of product
ions. False positive rates were determined empirically and all reported
identifications were based on E values that correlated
to less than a 1% false positive rate across all protein spectral
matches in a given analysis. For all analyses described, an E value cutoff of 1 × 10–3 correlated
to a false positive rate of less than 1%.

Results and Discussion
As stated previously, top down protein characterization thus far
has largely been limited to single proteins in infusion type experiments
for which high purity and copious amounts of sample allow extensive
signal averaging to enhance the resolution of crowded product ion
spectra. Using this approach, complete or nearly complete characterization
of several proteins has been demonstrated, in which fragment ions
representing cleavage at every inter-residue bond were observed.20,22 To attain this level of characterization on an LC time scale requires
informative product ion spectra to be obtained in each scan without
excessive signal averaging. To confirm that product ion spectra were
acquired at ideal conditions for UVPD, a series of model proteins
was infused to allow assessment and optimization of experimental parameters
to be used in an online LC–MS method. Specifically, the number
of averaged scans and the user defined nominal resolution (which correlates
to the resolving power observed at m/z 400) were interrogated. Supplemental Figure 1A,B in the Supporting Information shows the outcomes for
one protein (myoglobin) with respect to the changes in the number
of matched fragment ions as each parameter was varied. At resolving
powers of 60k and 120k, the number of matched ions was 64 on average
per spectrum, whereas it increased to an average of 104 at a resolving
power of 240k. In terms of the impact of the number of scans, a single
scan resulted in 34 fragment ions identified, whereas averaging 3
or 5 scans led to the identification of 96 or 104 fragment ions per
spectrum, respectively, for myoglobin.

To isolate each variable
from another when examining the effects
of the change in resolving power on the number of fragments observed,
the maximum number of averaged scans (five) was used, and for evaluating
the effects of the number of averaged scans, the maximum resolving
power was used (240k at m/z 400).
From examination of these two variables individually, the benefit
of using the highest possible resolution is clearly supported (Supplemental
Figure 1A in the Supporting Information), whereas the gain in matched fragment ions for averaging more than
three scans was marginal. From this analysis for myoglobin as well
as other model proteins of varying sizes (data not shown), the conditions
were set for the ribosomal analysis to use a single pulse at 2.5 mJ
for UVPD and to acquire the resulting spectra with three averaged
scans at the maximum resolution (240k).

Intact protein separation
is a notoriously challenging part of
high-throughput top down analysis, and is widely considered to be
the bottleneck preventing top down proteomics from being more widely
adopted. This problem has been overcome previously by maximizing peak
capacity via multiple dimensions of both isoelectric point and size-based
fractionation prior to reversed phase LC–MS.13 The ribosome represents a mixture of low complexity in
comparison to whole cell lysates, but even with low complexity samples
attaining adequate separation is crucial for top down fragmentation.
This requirement stems from the wide precursor ion isolation windows
(15–100 m/z) used to increase
transmission efficiency and coisolate multiple proteoforms (with a
single phosphorylation, for example) that are likely to share a high
proportion of fragment ions.30 As proteins
become larger, they occupy more charge states and as such are more
likely to be observed throughout the m/z landscape examined. Combining the wide isolation width requirement
with the increased likelihood of charge state envelopes occupying
more of the m/z landscape means
that without adequate resolution separations, there will be a considerable
degree of precursor overlap during ion isolation, complicating the
database search and increasing the likelihood of false positives.
For more complex mixtures, such as the yeast whole cell lysate also
examined, proteins were separated first using gel eluted liquid fraction
entrapment electrophoresis (GELFrEE) prior to online fractionation
by nanoLC with elution directly into the mass spectrometer. Chromatographic
separation was highly reproducible using a C4 300 Å pore size
reversed phase column (Supplemental Figure 2 in the Supporting Information).

To confirm that optimal conditions
were achieved for the HCD analyses
under the reduced pressures required for online intact protein and
product ion detection, the samples were run using three different
normalized collision energy settings (NCE 15, 25, and 35) and the
results compared (Supplemental Figure 3 in the Supporting Information). In general, the optimal HCD conditions
were dependent on the protein analyzed, more so than any variations
in the corresponding UVPD performance obtained for different proteins.
While the three HCD settings tested by no means represent an exhaustive
optimization procedure, they are an adequate parameter range for determining
methods that will optimally dissociate the largest proportion of proteins
encountered in a top down high-throughput analysis. To most accurately
portray the amount of information obtained for each individual protein,
the number of fragment ions observed in each product ion spectrum
are divided by the total number of residues for the matched protein
as shown in Figure 1. As reflected by the uniformly
higher number of fragment ions observed for UVPD in Figure 1, UVPD vastly outperformed HCD in terms of both
characterization and identification for the majority of proteins observed.
All identified proteoforms and their sequence coverages are summarized
in Supplemental Table 1 in the Supporting Information.

Figure 1 (A) Histogram depicting the number of fragments matched for ribosomal
proteins normalized to the protein length for UVPD (1 pulse, 3 scans
averaged) in comparison to the optimal HCD conditions (25 NCE and
3 scans averaged). (B) Histogram of the log of the magnitude change
in confidence associated with UVPD compared to HCD. In part A, proteins
followed by a single asterisk (∗) were observed only in the
HCD analysis, while proteins followed by two asterisks (∗∗)
were observed only in the UVPD analysis.

All analyses were performed using the same ad hoc modified
search
algorithm in order to match each spectrum with the most inclusive
array of possible fragment ions. The search algorithm included a,
a + 1, b, c, x, x + 1, y, y – 1, and z-type ions. The fragments
produced from HCD were predominantly b- and y-type, as expected, and
primarily a- and x-type for UVPD along with secondary contributions
from b, c, y, and z ions. The relative portion of a/x, b/y, and c/z
product ions generated upon UVPD-MS analysis of the ribosomal proteins
is shown in Figure 4. The increase in protein
characterization by UVPD is not due solely to an increase in the number
of fragmentation channels. If a small peptide dissociates into just
b- and y-type ions, it is understandable that a lower number of fragment
ions would be observed than if fragmentation channels resulting in
a, b, c, x, y, and z-type ions were accessed; however, UVPD does not
simply result in additional redundant ions. UVPD
produced both a greater number of fragment ions than HCD as well as
many additional ones arising from unique stretches of the protein
sequence. Several examples are illustrative of this outcome from the
ribosomal analysis. In an extreme case, the protein that returned
the highest number of fragment ions per residue, the stationary-phase-induced
ribosome associated protein (P68191, Mr = 5 092.77 Da, abbreviated as “SRA” in Figure 1) resulted in identification of 193 fragment ions
using UVPD and 81 fragment ions under the best HCD conditions examined
(Figure 1). The protein was completely characterized
by UVPD (i.e., fragments were observed representing every inter-residue
position), while seven inter-residue positions were missed using HCD.
Of the 193 ions observed for UVPD, 83 contained the N terminus and
51% of those were positionally unique (no redundancy in charge state
or ion type relative to a specific interresidue site), while 110 were
C terminally derived and 46% were positionally unique. The corresponding
best HCD spectrum (NCE 25) was interrogated using the same candidate
ion types as UVPD, and of the 81 fragments observed 40 were N-terminally
derived (with 68% positionally unique) and 41 were observed from the
C terminus (with 73% positionally unique). For the protein that yielded
the highest number of fragment ions using HCD, RL22 (Mr = 12 218.77 Da) (Figure 2) resulted in 104 total fragment ions. Of those, from the N terminus
39 out of 45 (87%) were positionally unique, and 51 of 59 (86%) from
the C terminus were positionally unique. UVPD resulted in a greater
than 2-fold increase in the total number of ions (217 in total), with
positionally unique fragmentation resulting from 89 of 124 (72%) N
terminal ions and 54 of 93 (58%) C terminal ions.

Figure 2 MS/MS spectra and associated
ion maps for ribosomal protein L22
(C from E. coli identified using (A) UVPD and using
(B) HCD. In each ion map, the cleavages resulting in b- and y-type
ions are blue, the cleavages resulting in a- and x-type ions are green,
and the cleavages resulting in c- and z-type ions are red.

On the basis of these results, UVPD exhibits some
informational
redundancy due to the multiplicity of ion types produced but there
are also a significantly greater number of ions covering regions of
the protein sequence (typically the middle region) that are not generated
by HCD.20 In short, the richer fragmentation
patterns produced by UVPD outweigh the cost of increasing the number
of searched ion types and offset the potential drawbacks of redundant
sequence ions, especially with respect to online characterization of proteins. To examine the changes in sensitivity for identification
associated with increasing the number of searchable ion types from
two (b, y) to nine (a, a + 1, b, c, x, x + 1, y, y – 1, z),
the HCD data set which provided the best results (NCE25) was used
for parallel bioinformatic analyses. The same deconvoluted .PUF file
was searched against the same database using the two different algorithms
(two ion types versus nine ion types). As expected, the total number
of false positives (as defined by hits matched to a randomized decoy
database) increased with the number of searchable ion types for the
HCD data (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Graphical display of
the increase in false positive rate as a function
of the number of ion types interrogated as shown by the relationship
between false positive rate and E value (displayed
here as the inverse log for convenience) for the ribosomal analysis
performed with HCD using the standard algorithm for b- and y-type
ions (green line) and for UVPD using both the conservative four ion
algorithm for identification (blue line) and the more aggressive nine
ion algorithm for characterization (red line).

For more complex mixtures, a two-phase approach was evaluated
as
a method for increasing the potential for protein identification by UVPD. On the basis of the relationship depicted in Figure 3, an algorithm to match only the most abundant ion
types produced upon UVPD (a, a + 1, x, and x + 1, see Figure 4) was created to decrease
the amount of false positives as an initial step to narrow down the
search space for increased confidence and sensitivity in identification.
The three curves depicted in Figure 3 demonstrate
the decrease in confidence associated with the total number of fragment
ion types interrogated. Comparing the green (HCD analysis searching
two ion types) and the red (UVPD analysis searching nine ion types)
analyses results in a 2.8-fold increase (from 1.2 to 3.3%) in false
positive rate at the highest (least confident) E values
examined. To alleviate this deficiency in identification that would
have adverse effects on lower abundance proteins with suboptimal quality
product ion spectra, the algorithm represented by the blue curve represents
a practical compromise. In an optimized two-step bioinformatic workflow,
the UVPD algorithms can be used in sequence starting with the more
sensitive 4-ion version to effectively narrow down the search space.
As stated previously, the 4-ion algorithm searches for a-, a + 1-,
x-, and x + 1-type ions, which represent an average of 46% of all
fragment ions identified using UVPD (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Distribution of fragment ions for identified ribosomal proteins
using UVPD. The high proportion of AX ions (46% on average) allowed
for creation of a faster and more sensitive custom algorithm to be
used for identification purposes only. Postidentification, other UVPD
fragment ion types can then be included for characterization of the
entire protein primary structure.

This high proportion ensures a low likelihood of proteins
being
identified with the 9-ion algorithm but not the 4-ion (these theoretical
“missed hits” would represent false negatives in the
first more sensitive search). Once the search space has been reduced
to include only candidate sequences with E values
lower than that which correlates to a threshold empirically determined
false positive rate, the 9-ion algorithm can be used for more complete
characterization. While this two step searching approach will have
little effect on the E values of proteins identified
with, for example, 150 matched fragment ions, the combined effects
of a drastic reduction in the number candidate sequences and an increase
in the number of searched ion types will benefit lower abundance proteins
identified from suboptimal quality product ion spectra. Using both
the 4- and 9-ion algorithms on a single data set will allow both identification-
and characterization-centric bioinformatic analyses to be performed
with a minimal loss in sensitivity when compared to fragmentation
methods that produce only two ion types.

Following analysis
of the E. coli ribosome, a
significantly more complex mixture, an S. cerevisiae whole cell lysate, was fractionated based on molecular weight and
the resulting fractions were analyzed by LC–MS/MS to demonstrate
the utility of UVPD for high-throughput characterization. Spectra
were searched against both forward and decoy versions of a preannotated
yeast proteome database using the more inclusive nine ion algorithm
for characterization. From this analysis, 292 proteoforms were identified
representing 215 canonical sequences and of those 168 proteoforms
contained some sort of PTM. All identified proteoforms, their sequence
coverages, and a histogram depicting the mass distribution of identified
proteins are included in Supplemental Table 2 in the Supporting Information. An example of a charge deconvoluted
UVPD mass spectrum acquired for a protein containing a PTM is shown
in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Shown at top left is a zoomed charge deconvoluted
region of the
spectrum assigned to Zeocin resistance protein (Q08245, Mr = 12 450.46 Da), which displayed nearly complete
interresidue fragmentation upon UVPD. In the ion map, the cleavages
resulting in b- and y-type ions are blue, the cleavages resulting
in a- and x-type ions are green, and the cleavages resulting in c-
and z-type ions are red. This allowed localization of the single phosphorylated
moiety to residue Ser39 (residue highlighted in a blue box in the
sequence). This proteoform was also acetylated at the N terminus (coded
in a box at the first residue) following demethionylation. The fragment
ion type distribution is shown on the right.

Zeocin resistance protein has been identified as phosphorylated
on several different sites in multiple large scale global phosphoproteomic
analyses.31−34 Despite the fact that the sites of phosphorylation have been identified
previously, top down analysis provides unprecedented information by
confirmation of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated sites simultaneously.
Single residue specific localization of the phosphorylation was enabled
not only by the extensive inter-residue fragmentation throughout the
primary sequence but also by the fact that UVPD maintains the CID-
and HCD-labile modification on the serine side chain. Previous analysis
using peptides (in both positive35 and
negative36,37 polarity) and proteins has demonstrated
that modifications are maintained similarly to electron-based fragmentation
methods. After UV photon absorption, ions in excited electronic states
may exhibit nonergodic dissociation behavior that permits access to
many fragmentation pathways,38 including
ones that do not disrupt the labile bonds associated with PTMs. This
level of characterization identifies a specific proteoform that can
be correlated to specific biological conditions. The bottom-up analyses
were able to identify that there were multiple phosphorylated sites
on the protein,31−34 but they were all present on different tryptic peptides, making
observation of all sites at the same time impossible using bottom-up
methods. With top down UVPD, the intact mass measurement provided
information concerning the number of phosphorylations (just a single
phosphorylation was observed at detectable levels), and the extensive
fragmentation upon UVPD allowed unambiguous localization to a single
residue, while simultaneously ruling out other previously observed
sites. This same or higher level of characterization was observed
for many proteins, thus facilitating confident identification of multiple
proteins that differed by a single amino acid. ATPase proteolipid
1 and 2 differ by a single substitution of serine to alanine in the
middle of the protein sequence. Compositionally, the chemical change
associated with this substitution is identical to artifactual oxidation,
which is frequently observed in mass spectrometry. The high level
of product ion sequence coverage achieved on either side of the changed
residue using UVPD allowed unambiguous matching to the correct product
ion sequence.

Conclusion
We have demonstrated
the utility of 193 nm UVPD for intact protein
identification and characterization in a high-throughput online fashion.
Method development work performed using prepared E. coli ribosomes confirmed the superior performance of UVPD when compared
to HCD under optimal conditions. From a single analysis of the E. coli ribosome, UVPD identified 45 unique sequences compared
to 44 identified by HCD. Of greater importance, the average number
of fragment ions observed was approximately 2-fold greater in the
matched UVPD spectra resulting in a substantial increase in confidence
(in the form of decreased E values). Despite the
fact that there are more fragmentation channels accessed by UVPD,
the higher number of fragment ions does not result entirely from a
duplicative multiplicity, and the benefit of increased UVPD fragmentation
outweighs the decrease in confidence from accommodating all produced
ion types. Additionally, an increase in confidence is achieved by
tailoring the database search to match only the most abundant ion
types produced following UVPD. Finally, a more complex fractionated
yeast whole cell lysate was examined, resulting in identification
of 292 proteoforms from 215 canonical sequences. In conclusion, UVPD
has been shown to outperform HCD for high-throughput protein characterization
and similar comparisons to electron-based fragmentation methods are
underway.
