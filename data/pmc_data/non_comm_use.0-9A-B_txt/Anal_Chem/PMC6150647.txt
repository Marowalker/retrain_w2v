Formalin-fixed
neuroendocrine tissues from American cockroaches
(Periplaneta americana) embedded in
paraffin more than 30 years ago were recently analyzed by matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI),
to reveal the histological localization of more than 20 peptide ions.
These represented protonated, and other cationic species of, at least,
14 known neuropeptides. The characterization of peptides in such historical
samples was made possible by a novel sample preparation protocol rendering
the endogenous peptides readily amenable to MSI analysis. The protocol
comprises brief deparaffinization steps involving xylene and ethanol,
and is further devoid of conventional aqueous washing, buffer incubations,
or antigen retrieval steps. Endogenous secretory peptides that are
typically highly soluble are therefore retained in-tissue with this
protocol. The method is fully “top-down”, that is, without
laborious in situ enzymatic digestion that typically disturbs the
detection of low-abundance endogenous peptides by MSI. Peptide identifications
were supported by accurate mass, on-tissue tandem MS analyses, and
by earlier MALDI-MSI results reported for freshly prepared P. americana samples. In contrast to earlier literature
accounts stating that MALDI-MSI detection of endogenous peptides is
possible only in fresh or freshly frozen tissues, or exceptionally,
in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) material of less than
1 year old, we demonstrate that MALDI-MSI works for endogenous peptides
in FFPE tissue of up to 30 years old. Our findings put forward a useful
method for digestion-free, high-throughput analysis of endogenous
peptides from FFPE samples and offer the potential for reinvestigating
archived and historically interesting FFPE material, such as those
stored in hospital biobanks.

==== Body
Endogenous
peptides represent
a subclass of biomolecules that participate in a diverse array of
physiological processes within most, if not all, multicellular organisms,
including humans. Prominent examples are the peptides produced by
the (neuro)endocrine system, but endogenous peptides are known to
regulate scores of other molecular activities, ranging from basic
processes such as DNA synthesis,1 to host
defense (antimicrobials) in outer epidermal layers.2,3 To
function as extracellular signaling molecules, endogenous peptides
are secreted by many different glands as water-soluble messengers
acting on membrane receptors on the surface of target cells that in
turn cause the release of intracellular secondary messengers.4 Understanding the (dys-)regulation of these signaling
pathways is of great interest in the study of
many diseases, endocrine disorders, and sensitivity to pharmaceuticals.5 To gain further insight into the biochemical
changes that occur related to endogenous peptide signaling, analytical
techniques are required that can identify different peptide structures
and resolve their spatial distribution within biological tissue. Identifying
changes in peptide distribution within the tissue is important as
peptides may be synthesized in one tissue region and stored/released
by another region. This is one of the reasons why genomic or transcriptomic
data do not always correlate with proteomic/peptidomic counterparts.
For instance, many neuropeptides produced within specific neurosecretory
regions of the brain are transported to and released from so-called
neurohemal sites, such as the pituitary gland, whereas others are
produced and secreted from the neurosecretory glands themselves.6,7

Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is an analytical technique
capable
of locally detecting hundreds of peptides and proteins based on their
differing mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio
while simultaneously mapping each molecule’s spatial distribution
in two- and even three-dimensions.8 Mass
spectrometry has been widely utilized in the field of peptidomics
and proteomics in both top-down and bottom-up workflows, with both
strategies also being applied to imaging modalities. As a significant
fraction of protein-centered MSI research is typically carried out
in collaboration with histopathologists, tissue samples are prepared
using the well-established clinical protocol of tissue fixation with
formaldehyde,9 followed by embedding in
paraffin. Formaldehyde (or formalin) fixation crosslinks the proteins
in the tissue, helping retain the cell morphology for histological
examination and providing long-term preservation. A heat-based and
proteolytic antigen retrieval step is typically performed to render
tissue samples prepared with this protocol amenable to proteomic analyses.
Such bottom-up approaches whereby in situ enzymatic digestion of proteins
and peptides is carried out before the MSI analysis has gained widespread
application, and it is generally accepted in the field that formaldehyde
fixation is incompatible with top-down workflows, that is, to detect
intact proteins.10 The major drawback of
using any protocol involving enzymatic digestion, however, is that
cleavage of all the proteins into smaller peptide fragments jeopardizes
the detection of endogenous peptides present, particularly those of
naturally low-abundance as peptide digests may produce isobaric peaks
that overlap with endogenous peptides. Moreover, single stage MS has
no ability to readily discern endogenous peptides from proteolytic
fragments and the digestion step itself introduces added risk of analyte
delocalization. In addition, protocols involving antigen retrieval
and enzymatic digestion typically involve the use of aqueous solutions
at elevated temperatures. For secretory peptides that are hydrophilic
in nature, and highly prone to rapid degradation, these conditions
can result in chemical alteration/breakdown, delocalization, or complete
loss of the peptides from the tissue.11 It is, therefore, not surprising that the conventional proteomics
MSI sample protocol is unfavorable for endogenous (neuro)peptide MSI
analysis. This is confirmed by studies from different laboratories
reporting that direct, digestion-free, imaging of (endogenous) peptides
by MSI straight from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues
is not possible.12,13

When targeting the detection
of proteins and endogenous peptides
in MSI, multiple studies in various biological tissues have been restricted
to fresh tissue preparations,14−18 freshly frozen preparations,19−23 or fresh tissues embedded in gelatin and snap-frozen.24,25 These also include the model system of the present paper, where
neuropeptides have been imaged in fresh P. americana (retro)cerebral whole mounted tissues and cryosections.26 Thus far, there has been only one report of
digestion-free imaging of endogenous peptides by MSI directly from
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. This was a matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MSI study investigating the effect
of different MALDI matrices and sample preparation (FFPE vs fresh
frozen) on the detectability of endogenous peptides and metabolites.12 One of the conclusions made from the study was
the necessity of the use of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (a “reactive”
matrix) to enable endogenous peptides’ MALDI detection. In
addition, it was reported that endogenous peptides are only detectable
from FFPE tissue within 1 year from the time of embedding and then
only by incorporating the reactive matrix in the sample preparation.12 This assertion severely limits the number of
samples that would be accessible by digestion-free MSI analysis, as
the majority of samples in the many banks of FFPE tissues that exist
in hospitals, laboratories, and research institutes around the world
are older than 1 year. Therefore, the development of a method that
makes FFPE samples older than 1 year compatible with MSI of endogenous
peptides would be very advantageous.

With the aim to develop
an MSI method capable of detecting endogenous
peptides from aged FFPE tissue, we focused on samples of model neuropeptide
secreting tissues that were fixed and embedded 31 years prior to analysis.27 These samples were taken from an insect retrocerebral
complex, a neurosecretory tissue serving as a model biological system
for neuropeptide secretion of higher-order animals, such as in the
mammalian pituitary.18 We describe a novel
MSI sample preparation method for the digestion-free detection of
endogenous neuropeptides and its application to >30-year-old FFPE
tissue of P. americana. The method
is free of enzymatic digestion, antigen retrieval, or aqueous washing
of the tissue, allowing the label-free detection of endogenous peptides
by (MALDI) MSI. These findings demonstrate that the imaging of endogenous
peptides by mass spectrometry is possible from FFPE tissues embedded
up to 30 years ago thus unlocking the possibility of conducting retrospective
studies on endogenous peptides using the plethora of FFPE samples
stored by pathologists and histologists all over the world.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
HPLC-grade ethanol (dehydrated) was purchased
from Biosolve B.V. (Valkenswaard, The Netherlands). Xylene (>99%),
HPLC-grade acetonitrile (ACN; >99.93%), 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid
(DHB; >99.0%), and trifluoracetic acid (TFA; 99%) were purchased
from
Sigma-Aldrich (Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands).

Animals
In 1986,
American cockroaches (Periplaneta americana L.) of the same sex and developmental
stage (all were adult sexually mature insects) were taken from a stock
colony maintained under standard laboratory conditions and provided
with dry dog food, oatmeal, and water ad libitum.27 Retrocerebral complexes, consisting of the corpora cardiaca
(CC, both the glandular (CCg) and the storage part (CCs)) and the
corpora allata (CA; Figure 1), were dissected, while the tissue was immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde
(i.e., 10% formalin). To allow easy handling and forceps manipulation
of the tissue for processing into paraffin, the tissue of interest
was dissected while still associated with a piece of the underlying
foregut (Figure 1a).
Following overnight fixation, the tissues were dehydrated and embedded
in paraffin as described previously27 and
stored at ambient temperature until their use for MSI in 2017.

Tissue Preparation
In 2017 (i.e., 31 years after formalin
fixation and paraffin embedding), the cockroach neuroendocrine tissues
were sectioned at 20 μm thickness on a standard microtome (Leica
Reichert-Jung 2040 Autocut). A series of ribbons of 10–15 adjacent
sections were transferred onto indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass
slides (3–4 ribbons per slide, 8 in total, representing the
entire embedded tissue). The slides were put on a hot plate (50 °C)
where the paraffin sections stretched and allowed to air-dry for 30
min, after which they were stored at room temperature until needed.
Prior to matrix application, sectioned tissues were deparaffinized
using a modified deparaffinization protocol that omits aqueous washing
steps. Slides were immersed in xylene (100%; 3 min), fresh xylene
(100%; 2 min), ethanol (100%; 2 min), and then fresh ethanol (100%;
1 min). The deparaffinized samples were allowed to dry in a fume hood
(1–2 min) and then coated with a matrix solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic
acid (DHB; 50 mg/mL) in ACN/H2O/TFA (49.95:49.95:0.1 v/v).
The matrix solution was applied as a nebulized spray using a TM sprayer
(HTX Technologies, NC, U.S.A.) with the following settings: flow rate,
0.1 mL/min; spray nozzle velocity, 1200 mm/min; spray nozzle temperature,
75 °C; number of passes, 3; nitrogen gas pressure, 10 psi; track
spacing, 1 mm; drying time between passes, 10 s.

MALDI MS Imaging
Acquisition
Accurate mass measurements
were performed on five replicate samples in positive-ion mode in the
range of m/z 500–2000 using
a hybrid ion trap-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (LTQ Velos Pro Orbitrap
Elite, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) coupled to an intermediate-pressure
MALDI/ESI source based on a dual ion-funnel geometry (Spectroglyph
LLC, Kennewick, WA, U.S.A.).28 Prior to
imaging experiments, the instrument was mass calibrated with the Pierce
LTQ Velos calibration solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen,
Germany) using the ESI source. All Orbitrap spectra were acquired
at a nominal mass resolution of 120000 fwhm@m/z 400 using a 250 ms injection time. A frequency tripled
Nd:YLF laser (349 nm) was operated at 1 kHz, a pulse energy of 1.5
μJ and focused to a ∼15 μm spot. Orbitrap-based
MS images were recorded at a spatial resolution of 20 μm. Visualization
of data was achieved by converting the raw data into a Matlab-readable
format and using in-house-developed Matlab tools for baseline correction
and peak picking as recently described.28,29

For
high-throughput measurements of multiple tissue sections, 26 consecutive
sections were analyzed in positive-ion mode using a rapifleX MALDI
ToF (time-of-flight) mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica,
MA, U.S.A.). Spectra were acquired in the m/z 500–2000 range with the ToF analyzer operating
in reflectron mode. Prior to imaging experiments, the instrument was
mass calibrated using the monoisotopic cluster peaks of red phosphorus
spotted directly onto the target plate. Imaging experiments were controlled
by the flexImaging 4.0 software (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA,
U.S.A.) with a laser raster size of 40 μm × 40 μm
and a stage motion (i.e., pixel size) of 50 μm × 50 μm.
At each pixel position, 200 laser shots were summed to generate a
representative spectrum for each pixel, with the digitizer sampling
rate at 1.25 GS/s. Data processing, visualization, and coregistration
of optical images was performed using the SCiLS Lab software version
2018b (SCiLS GmbH, Bremen, Germany). Mass spectra were preprocessed
during import into SCiLS Lab using baseline removal by iterative convolution
and root-mean-square (RMS) spectral normalization.30 For subsequent data analysis, a minimum interval width
of 300 mDa around the average peak center was used to account for
peak shifts throughout the experiment.

H&E Staining
Sections were recuperated after MSI
data recording and poststained with hematoxylin and eosin to facilitate
histological recognition of the different cell and tissue types/features.
DHB matrix was removed from the sections by a 5 min wash in 70% ethanol,
followed by a brief wash in distilled water. Slides were then stained
in Harris hematoxylin solution for 8 min, after which they were washed
in running tap water for 5 min. Subsequently, sections were counterstained
in eosin-phloxine solution for 1 min, followed by conventional dehydration
and coverslipping; dehydration through 70% and 96% ethanol (two changes
of 5 min each), clearing steps in two changes of xylene (5 min each),
and mounting with xylene-based mounting medium.

Data Analysis
Imaging data were subjected to principle
component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis using the
Matlab-based ChemomeTricks software package (v. 1.51) that provides
unsupervised clustering of spatially correlated peaks.29 Peaks with peptide-like isotopic distribution
in clusters showing high spatial correlation with the various tissue
regions (aided by visual inspection of H&E stained sections) and
thus assumed to be arising from tissue-derived signals, were targeted
for further interrogation.

Structural Characterization
Structural
assignments
of ions were supported by accurate mass measurements from the Orbitrap
analyzer and MS/MS measurements following collision-induced dissociation
(CID) performed and detected in the ion-trap analyzer for peptides
detected at high enough signal (SI, Figure 1). MS/MS spectra were analyzed using the PEAKS DB algorithm included
in PEAKS Studio (Version 8.5; BioInformatics Solutions, Waterloo,
Canada) for de novo sequencing assisted sequence database interrogation-based
protein identification.31 Sequence validation
searches were against a database containing known neuropeptides as
well as a subdatabase of all insect proteins contained in the NCBI
nonredundant database. Accurate mass assignments were made using a
±3 ppm mass tolerance and an ion-trap fragmentation mass error
tolerance of 0.5 Da with a “no enzyme search” selected.
The variable modifications selected were pyro-Glu (pQ) from Q, sulfation,
and amidation, allowing three variable post-translational modifications
per peptide. Peptides with a −10 log P score
greater than 20 were considered accurately identified.

Results
The retrocerebral complex of P. americana cockroaches, preserved as FFPE samples over 30 years ago, were analyzed
by MALDI-MSI. To render the tissues amenable to MSI with minimal perturbation
of the endogenous peptides, we developed a new, simplified protocol
for sample processing as described in more detail in the methods section.
Briefly, samples were placed in a xylene bath twice for the bulk removal
of the paraffin, followed by a 100% ethanol bath (twice) to remove
the residual xylene and soluble compounds from the tissue maximally
reducing its hydrophobicity, and thus rendering it readily miscible
with the hydrophilic matrix solution. After the samples were air-dried
and coated with DHB matrix, MALDI-MS was performed on the insect retrocerebral
complex tissue in positive-ion mode (Figure 1). Because the obtained mass spectra were
dominated by matrix cluster peaks, background subtraction was applied,
yielding more than 20 peptide signals with high signal-to-noise in
the m/z 500–2000 range. Single
pixel, background subtracted spectra acquired from the CCs and CCg
regions of the retrocerebral complex are shown in Figure 1b and c, respectively.

Verification that MS signals originate from endogenous peptides,
rather than from nonpeptide (background) ions, was supported by accurate
mass measurements using the Orbitrap mass analyzer at 120000 resolving
power setting. Ultimate molecular sequence assignments of the peaks
labeled in Figure 1 were based on accurate mass determination and MS/MS fragmentation
data from CID tandem MS experiments. A total of 18 of the peptide
ion species could be readily identified and assigned to established
cockroach neuropeptide sequences (Table 1), consistent with previous reports in literature
on MALDI-MS analyses of fresh preparations of P. americana tissue. They represent 14 neuropeptides detected as multiple adduct
species, being previously detected in the P. americana retrocerebral complex by MALDI-MS and sequenced by tandem MS.26,32 These include hypertrehalosemic hormones, corazonin, sulfakinins,
pyrokinins, kinin, and allatostatin. Products from all these neuropeptide
precursors are detected throughout the CCs tissue (Figure 1b), including leucomyosuppressin
(Pea-LMS), corazonin, the sulfakinins Pea-SK and leucosulfakinin (Pea-LSK-II),
kinin (Pea-K-1), and a range of pyrokinins (Pea-PK-1 to Pea-PK-6).
The CCg region spectrum (Figure 1c) is dominated by the American cockroach cardioacceleratory
hormones I and II (Pea-CAH-1 and Pea-CAH-2).33 These two hypertrehalosemic hormones are readily detected as Na+ adducts at m/z 995.4346
and 1010.4709, respectively, an observation also made in previous
studies.18,27

As illustrated by representative
on-tissue, single-pixel mass spectra
of the various regions of the retrocerebral complex (Figure 1), many of the observed peaks
were detected at low relative abundances, being present at tissue
(sub)structures, i.e., specific neurosecretory nerve fiber bundles
and neuroendocrine cell groups. The MSI data were processed using
PCA to facilitate identification of low-abundance peaks originating
from different tissue locations. Using this method, spectral features
(i.e., peaks associated with peptide ions) were clustered based on
their spatial correlation.

Correlation clustering of principal
components 1–6 (Figure 2a) exhibited a bifurcation
that separates the “tissue-related” features from many
of the features that are associated with background signals, reflecting
MALDI matrix ion clusters and other chemical background. The assignment
of this cluster to tissue-related features as opposed to background
features enables a targeted interpretation of the complex MSI data
and is sustained by the two-dimensional false-color images (Figure 2; inset). The false-color
images describe the correlation of each pixel to the representative
spectrum of the tissue-related feature cluster (Figure 2). Within the main tissue-related branch
of the dendrogram, subsets of clustering features register to the
main histological parts of orthopteroid insect retrocerebral complexes
(Figure 2c). These consist of the CCg, the CCs, and the CA regions.26,34,35Figures 3a-c confirms this as mean spectra
from each of these clusters display the distinct molecular signature
of anatomical regions that include (among others) the endogenous peptides
identified in Table 1. As expected, the glandular portion of the corpus cardiacum (CCg, Figure 3a) contains predominantly
Pea-CAH-1 and Pea-CAH-2 as sodiated ions at m/z 995.4352 and 1010.4709, respectively. As the tissue transitions
into the storage part of the corpus cardiacum (Figure 3b), the two CAH peptides are still present
but the relative abundance of corazonin and myotropins such as leucomyosuppressin
(Pea-LMS) and sulfakinins (including Pea-SK and Pea-LSK-2) increases.
The mean spectrum describing the CA (Figure 3c) is markedly different to those observed
for the CCg and CCs. While still containing a significant amount of
Pea-LMS and corazonin, a range of pyrokinins are also observed to
pass through the CA. This confirms previous immunohistochemical results
as well as mass spectrometry analyses, indicating that specific nerves
running through the CA contain these neuropeptides.6,36,37

Remarkably, little if any qualitative
differences can be observed
between the >30 year old FFPE tissue detected peptides and those
that
can be imaged in freshly prepared unfixed cockroach CC/CA18,26 or that have recently have been reported detectable in P. americana CC/CA cryosections.38 In a few sections of the >30 years old FFPE tissue preparation,
the well-known cockroach pentapeptide neurohormone, proctolin, which
was not reported in our previous publication,26 was detected. Proctolin was the very first insect neuropeptide (a
myotropic peptide) to be sequenced (RYLPT) after a laborious isolation
effort starting from 125 kg of adult American cockroaches.39 Ions associated with proctolin (m/z 649.3668; [M + H]+) were found to
be present exclusively in sections containing a small cross section
through the insect’s recurrent nerve (which was not included
in the whole mount tissue preparation analyzed in our work mentioned
above18,26). Indeed, the nervus recurrens, part of
the cockroach stomatogastric nervous system, is known to transport
proctolin from the frontal ganglion further into the body.40 None of the above typical neuropeptide signals
are observed in the non-neuronal tissues present in the histological
section, such as the insect foregut epithelium and visceral muscle,
as well as its tracheal system (see also Figure 4a).

Using a high-throughput MALDI-ToF instrument, 26 FFPE serial
sections
from a 30 year old paraffin block containing a P. americana retrocerebral complex (deposited on a single glass slide) were analyzed
by MALDI-MSI at 50 μm spatial resolution (Figure 4). Figure 4a shows the distribution of three selected endogenous
peptides: Pea-PK-3, Pea-CAH-1, and corazonin as overlays on an optical
image of the tissue poststained with H&E. The images demonstrate
that the sample preparation method was effective across multiple tissue
sections for the detection of endogenous peptides from FFPE tissue
with minimal delocalization. The observed localization of all the
known CC/CA neuropeptides detected (which exhibit distinct spatial
distributions within each section, and at various depths throughout
the volume of the retrocerebral complex (circled in black)) is limited
to the neurosecretory tissue, as the neighboring foregut tissue did
not yield signals associated with known neuropeptide ions. Peaks for
all the neuropeptides listed in Table 1 were detected at various positions throughout the
3D volume of the retrocerebral complex with a representative positive-ion
mode single pixel spectrum shown in Figure 4b.

Discussion
More than a decade ago,
the group of Salzet and Fournier reported
“trypsin-free” imaging of a neuropeptide from young
FFPE material prepared with the “reactive” MALDI matrix
2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine.12 However,
they were unable to image neuropeptides in older material, concluding
that FFPE neuropeptide imaging by MALDI-MSI only works using a reactive
matrix, and only on tissues less than 1 year after embedding.

Following this work, Chaurand et al.41 as well as Gray et al.42 evaluated alcohol-based
alternative fixation methods that were amenable to protein MSI as
an alternative to cryopreservation. The former study (analyzing mouse
lung, kidney, brain and liver) employed 70% ethanol, and the latter
reported MALDI-ToF data from chick heart tissue fixed in acidified
alcohol.41 Chaurand et al.41 extensively addressed the considerable wash-out of proteins
during EtOH fixation, and both reports show data of “protein-like”
MALDI-MS peaks (between m/z 2000–50000)
in ethanol-preserved paraffin-embedded (EPPE) material. These studies
demonstrated that a considerable proportion of the peptides and low
molecular weight proteins were extracted from the tissue during ethanol
“fixation”, implying that this methodology is not optimal
for small, low-abundant endogenous peptide imaging. It has also been
stated that the chemical crosslinking by formaldehyde fixation renders
samples unsuitable for MSI analysis of proteins, unless enzymatic
digestion is included in the protocol. Based on those findings, recent
studies investigating neuropeptides within the retrocerebral complexes
of P. americana using MSI have targeted
freshly frozen and cryo-embedded tissues. As such the studies by the
Predel group38 not only confirm and validate
our previous study on fresh cockroach neuropeptide MSI,26 but also our current work. More extensive lists
of P. americana neuropeptide sequences
identified from cockroach neuronal tissues different than the currently
examined CC/CA have been reported previously.32,36

The major novelty of the present work is the finding that
endogenous
secretory peptides such as authentic neuropeptides can be analyzed
by MSI in formaldehyde-fixed material that is paraffin-embedded for
several years and stored at ambient temperature for the duration.
Exemplar tissues investigated in this paper included neurosecretory
glands containing a set of known neuropeptides reported above. Our
data indicate that in the model system investigated, the majority
of the neuropeptides detectable in fresh or freshly frozen tissue
are similarly detected as neuropeptide ion peaks in 30 year-old FFPE
tissues. This confirms that several neuropeptides remain fully preserved
in the tissue “unharmed”, that is, not degraded by catabolic
enzymes.

In principle this is not surprising, as neuropeptides
can be detected
in FFPE tissues with antibodies in immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses.
The rinsing and dehydration steps after formaldehyde fixation and
prior to paraffin embedding, therefore, do not cause a complete removal
of small (neuro)peptides or chemical alteration of the relevant part
of a peptide required for neuropeptide antibody recognition.

Accordingly, the general belief that all peptides become inaccessible
for MSI in tissues following formalin-fixation, without first performing
in situ digestion,10 is disproven in this
study. In view of the underlying chemistry of formaldehyde crosslinking,
we rationalize this as follows.43 Not all
amino acid residues within a peptide sequence react with the smallest
aldehyde to the same extent. Especially, the amino groups covalently
bind to formaldehyde, that is, the amino terminus and the amino groups
in the amino acid side chains, in particular, the ε-amino function
in Lys residues.43,44 Like most (bio)chemical reactions,
however, the formaldehyde-fixation is an equilibrium reaction. Hence,
for each of the formaldehyde-reactive amino acid residues, a fraction
is not crosslinked. Thus, for peptide species with a short sequence,
especially with only one or less Lys residues and lacking a free amino
terminus, it is likely that the proportion of molecules that are not
fully crosslinked is substantial, and able to be detected with sensitive
MS instrumentation.

In view of the above, our method is expected
to have a bias in
favor of shorter peptides with less Lys-residues. Recent statistics
of the UniProt/TrEMBL sequence database (UniProt Release 2017_12; http://www.uniprot.org/statistics/TrEMBL), indicate that the overall frequency of Lys residues in a protein
is 5.0%, which means that on average each 20th amino acid residue
in a protein is a Lys. Longer proteins with more than one Lys residue
have a greater probability to be more extensively crosslinked and
are, therefore, more challenging to detect by mass spectrometry in
FFPE samples.

In the same context, we remark that of the peptides we successfully
imaged in this study (Table 1), none appears to contain a lysine, and a significant number
have a blocked amino terminus (pQ, pyroglutamate). Not surprisingly,
all peptides positively identified in this study have <20 residues
(with Pea-PK-6, the longest known neuropeptide imaged in this study,
totaling 14 residues).

Following the same logic, it is highly
unlikely that large polypeptides
and proteins would freely exist in FFPE tissue. Such multiple crosslinking
through formaldehyde fixation is thought to be one of the mechanisms
by which tissues can be preserved for ages. Since the typical proteases,
peptidases, and other catabolic/protein modifying enzymes are invariably
large proteins which easily contain more than ∼300 amino acid
residues, they will be firmly crosslinked in FFPE material, and, therefore,
unable to exhibit any enzyme activity. Endogenous peptides, although
natively chemically very labile, will, therefore, “survive”
unmodified or catabolized. As such, rather than obstructing (top-down)
peptidomics analyses, formalin fixation may well be an efficient catabolic
enzyme deactivating sample preparation/stabilization step if one wants
to preserve small peptides.

Conclusion
We have developed an
MSI protocol that enabled the localization
of secretory endogenous (neuro)peptides on more than 30 years old
FFPE tissue. We conclude that the covalent formaldehyde crosslinking
of small neuropeptides (especially, but not exclusively, amino terminally
blocked and poor in lysine content) with other biomolecules is not
100% complete. At the same time, the washing and dehydration steps
prior to paraffin embedding do not cause a complete removal of small
noncrosslinked (neuro)peptides, and the risk to remove peptides through
the necessary (but maximally reduced) deparaffinization and rehydration
steps may be overrated. The method does not include laborious in situ
protease digestion or antigen retrieval steps that are known to negatively
interfere with the detection of low abundant endogenous peptides.
Our current work unequivocally indicates that lysine-low peptides
as large as 14 amino acid residues can be structurally characterized
and imaged in FFPE material stored for 30 years. The method is likely
to be universally applicable to biology in general and to the study
of health and disease. The results of our analyses using de novo sequencing
assisted database searching indicates that the newly described workflow
could potentially be used as a discovery tool to image previously
undescribed (neuro)peptides. Excitingly, this method has the potential
to unlock part of the biologically relevant molecular information
“fixed” in the many millions of FFPE tissue blocks,
which are catalogued in biobanks of hospitals, research institutes,
and even museums of natural history worldwide.
