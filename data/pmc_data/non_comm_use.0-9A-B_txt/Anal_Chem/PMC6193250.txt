The liver is the
primary organ involved in handling of bile salts,
a class of amphipathic molecules with signaling activities as well
as desired and detrimental detergent actions. To allow in-depth investigation
of functions of bile salts in healthy and diseased liver, the spatial
distribution of bile salt species within the liver needs to be studied.
Therefore, the aim of our study was to determine hepatic bile salt
distribution and identify specific lipid markers that define the structural
elements of the liver. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass
spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) was used to monitor the spatial distribution
of bile salts and lipids in liver sections of rat, dog, and patients
with unaffected and cholestatic parenchyma. MALDI-MSI in negative
ion mode showed the local presence of a variety of bile salts, predominantly
taurine-conjugates, as localized patches of varying sizes (representing
the bile ducts) throughout the liver tissue. Specific molecular markers
were identified for the connective tissue (phosphatidic acids, e.g.,
[PA (18:0_18:1)–H]−), the liver parenchyma
(phosphatidylinositols, e.g., [PI (18:0_20:4)-H]−), and the bile ducts (hydroxylated-sulfatides, e.g., [ST–OH
(18:1_24:0)-H]−). One of these sulfatides (at m/z 906.6339) was found to be uniquely
localized in a thin lining on the inside of the bile duct, colocalized
with cytokeratins, and encased luminal bile salts. A similar distribution
of the aforementioned sulfatide was observed, albeit in constricted
ductular structures, in the liver of a patient with a mild clinical
phenotype of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). In contrast, sulfatides
were virtually absent in the liver of patients with PSC and a severe
clinical phenotype, with (atypical) cholanoids (e.g., the bile alcohol
5-cyprinolsulfate) abundant in the extra-ductular space and glyco(cheno)deoxycholic
acid-3-sulfate localized to fibrotic connective tissue. The latter
two molecular species were able to discriminate between healthy liver
tissue (n = 3) and tissue from PSC patients with
a severe clinical phenotype (n = 3). In conclusion,
the distinct structural elements of the mammalian liver are characterized
by specific classes of lipids. We propose that (hydroxylated-)sulfatides
are specific molecular markers of the bile duct.

==== Body
During the
past two decades,
bile salts have been upgraded from molecules required for absorption
of dietary lipids and fat-soluble vitamins, to signaling molecules
regulating biological processes as diverse as nutrient metabolism,
inflammation, and liver regeneration.1−4 The discovery of bile salt receptors that
mediate these signaling activities was key to the renewed interest
in bile salts by academic and pharmaceutical communities. In particular,
Farnesoid-X Receptor (FXR), a bile salt-activated transcription factor
with an essential role in bile salt homeostasis, has been studied
extensively. FXR agonism-based therapy has already been approved for
treatment of patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and inadequate
response to ursodeoxycholic acid.5 Multiple
clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate efficacy of FXR agonists in
treatment of metabolic liver disorders like nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH).6,7

The liver is the primary organ involved
in the synthesis and handling
of bile salts. Being amphipathic molecules, bile salts in the aqueous
phase can interact with biological membranes. Consequently, the liver
is the prime site where injury occurs when bile formation or flow
of bile is impaired, and toxic levels of bile salts build up inside
the parenchymal cells. At a certain threshold, intracellular bile
salts damage mitochondrial membranes and initiate a sterile inflammatory
response that results in immune-mediated tissue injury.8−10 In drug development, drug-induced cholestasis is a common reason
for halting further development in preclinical phases of testing.11

Distinct bile salt species arise from
different synthetic routes
in the host, utilization of either glycine or taurine for formation
of N-amidated conjugates, and biotransformation by
the gut microbiota.1 Individual bile salt
species have distinct signaling properties and toxicity profiles.
Mass spectrometry (MS)-based analytical tools have been of great value
to determine bile salt composition of (homogenized) biospecimens (e.g.,
serum, bile, urine, feces, and liver tissue) from healthy and diseased
subjects.

Study of hepatic bile salt composition requires the
preparation
of a homogenate, inevitably resulting in loss of spatial information.
As several aspects of hepatic bile salt handling are known to be zonated
(e.g., extraction of bile salts from the portal supply in the periportal
area, de novo synthesis in the pericentral area),12 information on the local distribution of bile salts within
the liver could further advance our understanding of bile salt (patho)physiology.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry imaging
(MALDI-MSI) has been extensively used to monitor the distribution
of drugs, lipids, peptides, and proteins in tissue sections, making
this an ideal tool to determine the molecular profiles of the various
compartments of healthy and diseased liver. Here we used MALDI-MSI
to study the spatial distribution of bile salts within the liver of
animal species commonly used in preclinical drug testing, as well
as in noncholestatic and cholestatic human liver parenchyma. Specific
aims were (i) to determine whether it is feasible to determine the
spatial distribution of distinct bile salt species in the liver, including
those with identical molecular mass, (ii) to identify lipid molecular
markers that define the structural elements of the liver anatomy,
and (iii) determine if there are unique molecular profiles that can
distinguish between healthy and diseased human liver and compare with
those obtained from preclinical animal species. This spatial molecular
information can be employed to address roles of defined molecules
in liver (dys)function, both in the context of human pathology and
drug screening programs.

Methods
Materials
Cholic
acid (CA), deoxycholic acid (DCA),
chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), lithocholic acid (LCA), taurocholic
acid (TCA), taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA), taurochenodeoxycholic acid
(TCDCA), glycocholic acid (GCA), glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA),
glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB), 9-aminoacridine
(9AA), chloroform (CHCl3), and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands).
Methanol (MeOH) was purchased from Biosolve (Valkenswaard, The Netherlands).

Liver Specimens
A healthy canine liver specimen (Marshall
Beagle, n = 1) was obtained in the framework of an
ongoing study at Janssen Pharmaceutica N. V. The study was approved
by the local animal ethical committee and conducted in facilities
accredited by national institutions adhering to AAALAC guidelines.
Human liver specimens were obtained from patients undergoing either
resection for hepatobiliary malignancies (nonaffected liver tissue
sample distant from the tumor, n = 3) or undergoing
liver transplantation for end-stage liver disease (PSC, n = 6). Patients with PSC were classified as severe cases if bilirubin
was ≥34 μmol/L along with ≥2 abnormal liver tests,
which included aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase
(ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT),
and international normalized ratio (INR) (see Table S1). Specimens were procured as part of biobank initiatives
at the Aachen (Medical Ethical approval no. EK 20609) and Maastricht
(Medical Ethical approval no. 14-4-153) locations of the Euregional
Surgical Center Aachen Maastricht (ESCAM) or from the Erasmus MC,
Rotterdam (Medical Ethical approval no. 167.902/1998/33 and no. 2014-060).
Patients gave written informed consent for biobanking and research
use of surgical specimens. A rat liver specimen (Wistar Han, n = 1) was obtained from a control group of rats sacrificed
for a study on colonic anastomotic healing (approved by the local
Animal Ethics Committee of the Radboud University, Nijmegen). Per
liver specimen, multiple sections throughout the tissue were analyzed
[i.e., dog (n = 7), noncholestatic patient (n = 7), PSC patients (n = 4), and rat (n = 9)].

Tissue Preparation
Liver tissue
was sectioned using
a Microm HM535 cryo-microtome (Microm International, Walldorf, Germany)
at a temperature of −20 °C to produce 10 μm thick
sections, which were thaw-mounted onto clean indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated
glass slides (4–8 Ω resistance, Delta Technologies, Stillwater,
MN, USA). Tissue sections were scanned prior to matrix application
using a Nikon Super CoolScan 5000 ED (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan)
to produce high-quality optical images. Consecutive tissue sections
were thaw-mounted on regular glass slides (Thermo Scientific) for
histological and immunohistochemical staining.

Matrix Application
Tissue sections were coated with
15 mg/mL DHB in 2:1 CHCl3:MeOH with 0.2% TFA using the
SunCollect automated pneumatic sprayer equipped with dispenser system
(Sunchrom GmbH, Friedrichsdorf, Germany) in a series of 15 layers.
The initial seeding layer was performed at 10 μL/min; subsequent
layers were performed at 20, 30, and 40 μL/min, respectively
(all at speed 450 mm/min, track spacing: 2 mm, height: 23 mm). For
negative-ion mode some tissue sections were coated with 10 mg/mL 9AA
in 70:30 MeOH:H2O in a series of 10 layers. The initial
seeding layer was performed at 10 μL/min; subsequent layers
were performed at 15, 20, and 25 μL/min, respectively (all at
speed, 450 mm/min; track spacing, 2 mm; height, 25 mm).

Instrumentation
MALDI-MSI
High-speed imaging was performed on a Bruker
RapifleX MALDI Tissuetyper system (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany)
equipped with a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser
(355 nm, 10 kHz); a more detailed description of this instrument is
provided elsewhere.13 The instrument was
operated in reflectron mode in both positive- and negative-ion modes
in the mass range m/z 400–1000.
The instrument was calibrated prior to analysis using red phosphorus
clusters in both polarities. The laser power was 80% with an accumulation
of 200 shots. Images of the whole tissue sections were acquired using
a 50 × 50 μm raster (25 × 25 μm beam scan area).
The images were generated using the FlexImaging version 5.0 software
(Bruker Daltonik GmbH) and were normalized to the total ion current
(TIC).

MALDI-FTICR-MSI
For confirmation of molecular identity,
high-mass resolution (100,000 at m/z 500) measurements were performed on a Bruker SolariX FTICR mass
spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) equipped with
a 9.4 T superconducting magnet and Nd:YAG laser. The instrument was
operated in both positive- and negative-ion modes in the mass range m/z 100–2000. The instrument was
calibrated prior to analysis using red phosphorus clusters in both
polarities. The laser power was 30% (2 kHz) with an accumulation of
100 shots. Images were acquired with a pixel size of 15 μm.
A 95% data reduced profile spectrum and spectrum peak list were saved
for further analysis. The images were generated using the FlexImaging
version 4.1 software (Bruker Daltonik GmbH) and were normalized to
the total ion current (TIC).

MALDI-MS/MS
For
further confirmation of molecular identity,
a Waters MALDI HDMS Synapt G2-Si mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation,
Manchester, UK) equipped with an Nd:YAG laser was used to perform
ion mobility separation (IMS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)
measurements. The instrument was calibrated using red phosphorus prior
to analysis. MS/MS was performed on consecutive tissue sections, the
laser power was 150 arbitrary units (1 kHz), and the ions of interest
were fragmented by collision induced dissociation (CID) in the trap
cell with an isolation window of approximately 3 Da. For ion mobility,
the IMS wave velocity was 900 m/s and the wave height was 40 V. For
presentation purposes, mass spectra from the MassLynx version 4.1
software (Waters Corporation) were exported in the form of text files
and imported into mMass, open-source software used for mass spectral
processing.14 The MS/MS spectra from the
commercial bile acid standards and tissue sections were compared to
those in the literature or databases such as lipid maps (www.lipidmaps.org) and the ALEX123
lipid calculator (www.alex123.info). The fragment ions observed in each MS/MS spectrum were assigned
based on the recently proposed nomenclature for lipids.15

TOF-SIMS
High spatial resolution
imaging was performed
using a PHI nanoTOF II TOF-SIMS instrument (Physical
Electronics, Minnesota, MN, USA) equipped with a 30 kV Binq+ cluster liquid metal ion gun (LMIG), which was operated
with a Bi3+ cluster ion beam. Images were acquired using
a tile size of 500 × 500 μm at 30 frames with an ion dose
of 2.59 × 1012 ions/cm2 in negative ion
mode; the data was acquired in the mass range m/z 0–1850 and a spatial resolution of ∼1 μm.
The instrument was calibrated using a combination of elements and
hydrocarbon fragments. The images were generated using software PHI
TOF-DR software (Physical Electronics).16

Tissue Staining
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and
Masson’s trichrome (MTC) staining was performed on consecutive
tissue sections (10 μm) followed by aqueous mounting. Optical
images of all stained tissue sections were acquired using a Mirax
desk scanner (Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany). Cryosections (5 μm
thickness) of liver tissue were used for immunohistochemistry; thinner
tissue sections were required to reduce background signal. The bile
duct epithelium was stained using a wide spectrum anticytokeratin
antibody (Dako/Agilent Pathology Solutions) and secondary detection
reagents. Detailed protocols are located in the Supporting Information.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed
on the MALDI-FTICR-MSI data using the in-house built ChemomeTricks
toolbox for Matlab version 7.0 software (The MathWorks, Natick, MA,
USA).17 Briefly, peak picking was performed
on an average spectrum (created using the peaks sqlite file) at a
0.001 Da bin size. The center of the peaks and integration ranges
were defined, to account for peak shifting from pixel-to-pixel. Principal
component analysis (PCA) was then performed on the converted data
sets, which were normalized to the total ion current. The peak list
from each principal component that highlighted different areas of
the liver was exported, and the top ten peaks (based on intensity)
were then identified.

Further statistical analysis was performed
on the MALDI-FTICR-MS imaging data set from healthy human liver (n = 3) and liver from patients with severe PSC (n = 3), using SCiLS lab version 2016b (SCiLS GmbH, Bremen,
Germany). The results were normalized to the total ion current (TIC),
and an average spectrum was created from all samples which was imported
into the mMass software and subjected to peak picking, to create a
peak list which was imported back into SCiLS lab. A receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the power
of selected molecular species to discriminate between healthy liver
and cases of severe PSC.

Results and Discussion
Identification of Bile
Salts
In order to have optimal
sensitivity and selectivity of the method applied, the physiologically
most relevant (non)conjugated primary and secondary bile salts (Figure S1) were spotted individually on a target
plate, coated with 9AA, and analyzed with MALDI-MS, according to previous
works.18,19 All bile salts were observed in their deprotonated
form ([M – H]−). MS/MS experiments were performed
on the standards (Figure S2). The taurine-conjugated
bile salts showed characteristic product ions, indicating the fragmentation
or loss of taurine such as m/z 80
(SO3–), 107 (C2H3O3S–), and 124 (C2H6NO3S–), whereas the glycine-conjugated
bile salts showed the loss of glycine m/z 74 (C2H5NO2–).20,21 The unconjugated bile salts showed fragments resulting from the
loss of H2O, CO2, and CH2O2.21 Isomeric species, such as chenodeoxycholic
acid (CDCA), deoxycholic acid (DCA), and their conjugated forms, can
be separated using chromatographic techniques.22 Here, ion mobility separation (IMS) was evaluated for separation
of isomeric bile salts. Standards of the isomeric bile salts were
applied as a mixture on a target plate and analyzed. Using this technique,
it was possible to differentiate between DCA and CDCA (Figure S3A); however, it was not possible to
separate the taurine (Figure S3B) or glycine-conjugated
variants thereof (Figure S3C). This is
likely due to the limited resolution of current commercial ion mobility
instrumentation. Since the bulk of hepatic bile salts are conjugated,
IMS was not suitable to analyze isomeric bile salt species in intact
tissues.

Spatial Distribution of Bile Salts and Lipids in Healthy Dog
Liver
High-speed imaging experiments on whole liver tissue
sections (at a spatial resolution of 50 μm) showed the distinct
distribution of various molecular markers linked to the different
tissue types found in the liver. Regions such as the parenchyma, the
bile ducts, the connective tissue, and the bile duct lumen could be
clearly distinguished in these MALDI-MS images (Figure 1A and S4A). Following
analysis of the whole tissue section, high mass and high spatial resolution
MALDI-FTICR-MSI was performed on specific areas, selected based on
histological and molecular features (Figure 1B and S4B). These
images provided greater spatial detail of the selected molecular species
and improved mass accuracy, improving molecular identification.

and (VIII) overlay of the selected species. (Designated masses are

mm2 area, and spatial resolution 15 μm. Images normalized
with TIC).

The optical image of the whole
liver tissue section prior to analysis
(Figure 1, panels A
and B, I) shows a homogeneous parenchyma with a cluster of large blood
vessels in the center of the tissue. Histological staining of consecutive
tissue sections was performed for reference. The hematoxylin and eosin
stain (Figure 1, panels
A and B, II) differentiates the eosinophilic hepatocellular parenchyma
from the brighter (slightly eosinophilic) stained portal areas, whereas
the blue Masson’s trichrome stain (Figure 1, panels A and B, III) highlights the presence
of collagen, indicating the portal connective tissue. This is abundant
around the large blood vessels, with smaller patches located throughout
the tissue section.

MALDI-MS imaging in negative-ion mode showed
the presence of predominantly
taurine-conjugated bile salts, the most abundant were taurocholic
acid (TCA) and taurochenodeoxycholic/taurodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA/TDCA).
This is to be expected as dogs use primarily taurine for bile acid
conjugation.23,24 The distribution of TCA at m/z 514.28 (Figure 1A, IV) showed localized patches of varying
sizes throughout the tissue, most likely representing the bile ducts.
The larger ones (average diameter 175–250 μm), which
are in close proximity to the large blood vessels, are septal bile
ducts. Smaller bile ducts (average diameter 20–70 μm)
distributed throughout the tissue, are the interlobular bile ducts.25 The identity of TCA was confirmed by MS/MS measurements
(Figure S5A). Interestingly, 3-keto-TCA
and 3-keto-TDCA/TCDCA were also present in the bile duct lumen. Keto
bile salts were previously detected in bear bile.26 Next to this, taurolithocholic acid was also present. The
connective tissue showed a strong presence of a lipid at m/z 701.51 (Figure 1A, V), which was identified by MS/MS measurements as
a phosphatidic acid [PA (18:0_18:1) – H]− (Figure S5B). This species was distributed
throughout the tissue but appeared to be more abundant in the connective
tissue, which correlates well with Masson’s trichrome staining
(Figure 1, panels A
and B, III). The connective tissue was also characterized by other
phosphatidic acids, phosphatidylserines (PS), and sphingomyelin (SM)
fragments ([M – CH3]−).27 It should be noted that the positive ion counterparts
of the SM fragments colocalized with observed species, hence confirming
their identification (see Figure S4). In
the surrounding liver parenchyma, the most abundant species, which
was homogeneously distributed throughout the parenchyma but absent
from the other areas of the tissue was identified using MS/MS measurements
as a phosphatidylinositol (PI), specifically [PI (18:0_20:4) –
H]− at m/z 885.55
(Figure 1A, VI and Figure S5C). Other PIs, PAs, and phosphatidylethanolamines
(PE) were predominantly present in this area.

Another lipid
species at m/z 906.64
(Figure 1A, VII) was
distributed in small localized patches throughout the tissue and colocalized
with the distribution of bile salts. The overlay of the selected species
(Figure 1A, VIII) shows
that selected species colocalize well together and clearly highlight
the different boundaries of the molecular components that make up
the bile duct and surrounding tissue. Following analysis of the whole
tissue section, high mass and high spatial resolution MALDI-FTICR-MS
imaging was performed on selected areas, which was selected based
on histological and molecular features. This provided far more detail
of the selected molecular species, as well as improved mass accuracy
enabling better confirmation of their identity (Figure 1B, III–V). Interestingly, MALDI-FTICR-MS
analysis revealed that the species at m/z 906.6339 was localized in a thin lining on the inside of the bile
duct (Figure 1B, VII).
This compound was identified, by MS/MS measurements, as a hydroxylated-sulfatide
[ST–OH (18:1_24:0) – H]− (Figure S5D), a ceramide derivative previously
identified by MALDI-MS/MS imaging of brain tissue.28 Nonhydroxylated sulfatides (ST) were also present in the
bile duct. The overlay of the selected molecular species (Figure 1B, VIII) recapitulated
the general histological features of the liver. All peaks identified
in the different regions of the healthy dog liver are shown in Tables S2 and S3.

Spatial Distribution of
Bile Salts and Lipids in Healthy Human
Liver
Healthy human liver tissue was analyzed next to study
(dis)similarities in spatial distribution of bile salt species and
molecular lipid markers of structural elements in the human liver
(Figure 2 and S6). Optical and histological images were again
acquired for reference (Figure 2, panels A and B, I–III). MALDI-MSI showed high signal
intensities of TCA at m/z 514.28
and TCDCA/TDCA at m/z 498.28, whereas
lower signal intensities of glyco(cheno)deoxycholic acid (GCDCA/GDCA)
at m/z 448.30 and glycocholic acid
(GCA) at m/z 464.30 were present
(Table S3). These findings were somewhat
unexpected since the human bile salt pool consists largely of glycine-conjugated
species, with taurine-conjugated bile salts comprising approximately
20% of the biliary bile salt pool.24 This
discrepancy is most likely attributed to the fact that the sulfonate
group of taurine conjugates is more easily ionized in negative-ion
mode than the carboxylic acid group of glycine conjugates.18,19 The distribution of TCA at m/z 514.28 (Figure 2A,
IV) showed a few small localized patches throughout the tissue, indicating
the presence of bile ducts. Both septal and interlobular bile ducts
were apparent in the studied specimen. Taurine-conjugated keto bile
salts and lithocholate were also detected in the bile ducts. Also
in human liver tissue, the connective tissue was defined by [PA (18:0_18:1)
– H]− at m/z 701.51 (Figure 2A,
V), and distribution of this lipid species matched the Masson’s
trichrome staining (Figure 2, panels A and B, III). Connective tissue was also characterized
by SM fragments and PS. Human liver parenchyma (Figure 2A, VI) was characterized by a PI [PI (18:0_20:4)
– H]− at m/z 885.55, as well as other PIs, PAs, and PEs. The hydroxylated-sulfatide
[ST–OH (18:1_24:0) – H]− at m/z 906.63 (Figure 2A, VII) appeared as small localized patches
throughout the tissue. The overlay of the selected species (Figure 2A, VIII) shows how
the selected ions colocalize and indicated the best area for high
spatial resolution MALDI-FTICR-MS imaging. The images again only showed
detailed views of the other selected species (Figures 2B, IV–VI). MALDI-FTICR-MSI analysis
showed the hydroxylated-sulfatide [ST–OH (18:1_24:0) –
H]− at m/z 906.6340
as a thin band located in the bile duct (Figure 2B, VII). The overlay of the selected species
(Figure 2B, VIII) demonstrated
the localization of the bile salts within the bile duct lumen, which
was bordered by a lining of the aforementioned hydroxylated-sulfatide.
Additional hydroxylated and nonhydroxylated sulfatide species were
observed in the bile duct wall. The peaks identified in the different
regions of the healthy human liver are shown in Tables S2 and S3.

Sulfatides are Novel Molecular Markers for
the Bile Duct Epithelium
Hydroxylated-sulfatide [ST–OH
(18:1_24:0) – H]− was identified in both
healthy dog and human liver
tissue and specifically localized as a thin band lining the bile duct.
This compound was the most prominent of several hydroxylated and nonhydroxylated
sulfatides that colocalized in the bile duct (Table S3). In order to determine whether sulfatides are specific
markers for the bile duct, immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratins
was performed on sections of dog and human liver (Figure 3). This revealed the presence
of cytokeratins in the cholangiocytes/bile duct epithelium (Figure 3, panels A and B,
II). MALDI-MSI of a consecutive section revealed [ST–OH (18:1_24:0)
– H]− at m/z 906.63 distributed as a ring-like structure (Figure 3, panels A and B, III). High spatial resolution
TOF-SIMS imaging of consecutive sections of dog and human liver confirmed
the confinement of sulfatides to the bile duct epithelium (Figure 3, panels A and B,
IV). The molecular images correlate well with the immunohistochemical
staining of the bile ducts indicating that these species, as well
as the other sulfatide species (Table S3) are molecular markers for the bile duct epithelium.

The unique localization of sulfatides
to bile duct epithelium suggests
a biologically relevant role. Sulfatides are glycosphingolipids that
contain an extra sulfate group and hence are commonly observed in
negative-ion mode. Sulfatides are predominantly found in the exoleaflet
of the membrane bilayer and have been detected in different tissues,
including the brain where they are an abundant component of the myelin
sheath, the pancreas (the islets of Langerhans), and the kidney.29 Although sulfatides were previously detected
in liver, their presence could not be attributed to a particular region
because those studies were performed on tissue extracts.30 Sulfatides are negatively charged and will likely
repel negatively charged compounds, such as bile salts, and may accordingly
play a role in protecting the bile duct epithelium from detergent
action of bile salt anions. Information on specific roles of sulfatides
in liver biology is sparse. Sulfatides are self-lipid antigens, and
presence of autoantibodies appears to be common in chronic autoimmune
liver diseases like autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cholangitis
(PBC).31 Sulfatides presented by CD1d protein
are recognized by type 2 natural killer T (NKT) cells. In the liver,
NKT cells are abundant in the sinusoids, with type I and type II NKT
cells having a pro- and anti-inflammatory action, respectively.32 Immune-mediated liver injury in an animal model
of alcoholic liver disease is dependent on type I NKT cells.33 Interestingly, activation of type II NKT cells
by sulfatides prevented inflammation and liver disease in this model
and may have a broader role in a tolerogenic response in inflammatory
liver disease.34 Given the abundance of
this lipid in the bile ducts, a link with inflammatory cholangiopathies
like PBC and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is plausible.

Spatial Distribution of Bile Salts and Sulfatides in Liver of
PSC Patients
Liver tissue from six patients undergoing liver
transplantation for treatment of PSC was analyzed by MALDI-FTICR-MSI
(Figures 4 and S7) to explore whether molecular species are
globally similar in diseased liver tissue. The first PSC patient (case
1, Table S1) was noncholestatic and was
considered to have a mild clinical phenotype. Histological evaluation
of a liver biopsy taken prior to transplantation revealed mild inflammation
but no fibrosis. Severe cases of PSC (n = 3) were
characterized by cholestasis (bilirubin ≥ 34 μmol/L)
and cholestatic liver injury/dysfunction (≥2 liver test abnormalities)
(Table S1).

Mild PSC
The optical
image of the tissue section showed
an elongated cluster of bile ducts/blood vessels surrounded by connective
tissue and a homogeneous parenchyma (Figure 4A, I). Hematoxylin and eosin (Figure 4A, II) and Masson’s
trichrome staining of liver sections of the initial patient with mild
PSC (Figure 4A, III)
revealed concentric periductal fibrosis with little periductal inflammatory
infiltrate. In addition, mixed inflammatory cells and bile ductular
proliferation were found at the periphery of the portal area extending
into the interlobular septa. For both patients (cases 1 and 2), the
histological features observed in the hepatic parenchyma, bile ducts,
and portal areas are associated with PSC.35 Despite these morphological differences, liver tissue of the patient
with mild PSC showed the same distribution of selected molecular species
as healthy human liver tissue. Taurine-conjugated species were the
most abundant bile salt species and localized to the bile duct lumen
(Figure 4A, IV). Blood
vessels in the portal area were marked by the presence of heme (Figure 4A, VII). Molecular
markers identified in the healthy human liver also defined the connective
tissue (Figure 4A,
VIII), parenchyma (Figure 4A, IX), and the bile ducts in the patient with mild PSC. The
distribution of [ST–OH (18:1_24:0) – H]− at m/z 906.6353 (Figure 4A, X) indicated that the bile
ducts were narrowed, a hallmark histological feature observed in PSC.37 The overlay shows that the selected species
colocalize well together and clearly highlight the different boundaries
of the molecular components (Figure 4A, XI). The mild/severe PSC (case 4) is classed as
such due to elevated bilirubin and clotting function, the liver also
has slightly above normal aspartate aminotransferase levels (>40
U/L).
All other parameters within the normal range (Table S1).

Severe PSC
The optical image shows
an inhomogeneous
parenchyma with fibrotic connective tissue dispersed throughout the
tissue (Figure 4B,
I). Histological examination of the liver from the initial patient
with severe PSC (case 2, Figure 4B, II and III) showed a diminished number/absence of
interlobular bile ducts, portal-to-portal bridging fibrosis, bile
ductular proliferation in portal areas, and fibrous septa with minimal
mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate. In addition nodular hepatocellular
regeneration, ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes, and yellow to
brown pigmentation were noted. Taurine-conjugated species were also
present in the liver of the patient with severe PSC (Figure 4B, IV); however, they appear
to have diffused out of the bile ducts into the surrounding parenchyma.
This is reminiscent of regurgitation of bile salts from leaky bile
ducts into the portal tracts in an animal model of PSC.36 Moreover, a unique bile salt species at m/z 531.2999 was observed (Figure 4B, V). MS/MS measurements indicated
loss of m/z 97 (HSO4–) and m/z 80 (SO3–), leading to its tentative identification
as 5-cyprinolsulfate (5-CS). To our knowledge, the presence of 5-CS
(a sulfated bile alcohol abundant in cypriniform fishes)37 has not been previously reported in humans and
likely relates to cholestasis where elevation of urinary bile alcohols
was previously observed.38 In order to
confirm molecular identity, a whole-body tissue section of a zebra
fish, an authentic source of 5-CS, was analyzed. The MALDI-MS/MS spectrum
of 5-CS obtained from the initial patient with severe PSC was comparable
to that obtained from the zebra fish (Figure S8A). Glyco(cheno)deoxycholic acid-3-sulfate (G(C)DCA-S) at m/z 528.2639 was also identified in the
liver of the initial patient with severe PSC, which was not detected
in the mild PSC case. The MALDI-MS/MS spectrum of an authentic standard
is shown in Figure S8B. Molecular identity
of G(C)DCA-S in liver tissue was further supported by MALDI-FTICR-MS
and MS/MS measurements. In general, sulfation of bile salts is an
adaptive mechanism to promote elimination of bile salts that have
accumulated in the liver.39

Furthermore,
both unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin was observed. The MALDI-FTICR-MS
images show that the distribution of bilirubin at m/z 583.2569, bilirubin monoglucuronide at m/z 759.2899, and bilirubin diglucuronide
at m/z 935.3218 (Figure 4B, VI) coincided with that
of bile salts. Of note, 5-CS and bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated)
were not detected in the liver from the patient with mild PSC (Figures 4A, V and VI, respectively)
whose serum bilirubin levels were within the normal range. Elevation
of bilirubin can be seen following obstruction of bile flow resulting
in the release of conjugated bilirubin into the bloodstream. The lipid
at m/z 701.5128, identified as [PA
(18:0_18:1) – H]−, was abundant in the connective
tissue surrounding the blood vessels (Figure 4B, VII) and bile ducts, with a notably thicker
layer when compared to liver of the patient with mild PSC (Figure 4A, VIII) and is dispersed
throughout the parenchyma (Figure 4B, IX) which is apparent from the overlay of the selected
species (Figure 4B,
XI). Despite the occurrence of discrete patches of biliary constituents
(i.e., bile salts and bilirubin glucuronides) that indicates that
bile ducts are present (as confirmed by staining of consecutive sections
for cytokeratins), hydroxylated and nonhydroxylated sulfatides were
virtually absent in the liver of the initial patient with severe PSC
(Figure 4B, X and Figure S9). It is currently undetermined if absence/disappearance
of sulfatides from the bile ducts has pathological relevance. The
presence of sulfatides in tissue of severe PSC cases (Figure 4B, X) could be attributed to
small bile ducts that are typically not affected in PSC.35 In contrast, the larger bile ducts appeared
to be generally devoid of sulfatides and may have been damaged, as
bile salts were found in abundance into the surrounding parenchyma.
Thus, bile salts do not colocalize with the sulfatides that are still
present in severe PSC.

To determine the generality of the above
findings, liver samples
from four additional patients with PSC were analyzed and confirmed
the presence and localization of 5-CS and G(C)DCA-S in each sample,
albeit in varying abundance (Figure S10). To determine whether the observed molecular species can differentiate
between healthy human liver tissue and severe PSC liver tissue, ROC
analysis was performed. For this, three healthy liver specimens were
compared to the three cases of severe PSC where cholestatic liver
injury was evident (cases 2, 5, and 6). Liver from the three cases
of mild PSC (1, 3, and 4) was also compared with healthy liver, revealing
that ROC values for 5-CS, G(C)DCA-S, and the other characteristic
ions were approximately 0.5. Thus, it was not possible to differentiate
between healthy tissue and cases of mild PSC (data not shown).

G(C)DCA-S at m/z 528.2633 (AUC
0.957) and 5-CS at m/z 531.3000
(AUC 0.835) clearly differentiated between healthy liver tissue and
severe PSC liver tissue (Figure S11). The
atypical shape of the 5-CS ROC plot is due to the peak picking threshold,
and the fact that a lot of pixels in the image have an intensity of
zero. This is also apparent from the MALDI-FTICR-MS images of 5-CS
(Figure S10), which is observed as small
localized patches. In contrast, G(C)DCA-S is distributed throughout
the tissue, hence the ROC plot has a later plateau due to the high
number of pixels. 5-CS and G(C)DCA-S displayed different spatial distributions
in severe PSC (Figure S10, panels F and G), with 5-CS colocalizing with TCA and both seeming to spread into
the parenchyma. In contrast, G(C)DCA-S appeared to localize to connective
tissue. The mechanistic base for these distinct distributions is unclear.
The other examined molecular species (e.g., TCA, T(C)DCA and bilirubin)
did not have as much discriminating power (AUC 0.626, 0.721, and 0.568,
respectively, Table S4). The molecular
species identified in the liver of both mild and severe cases of PSC
samples are shown in Tables S2 and 3.

Interspecies Comparison of Molecular Profiles of Healthy Livers
Healthy rat liver was analyzed in the same manner, the resulting
MALDI-FTICR-MS images are shown in Figures S12 and S13. A distinct feature of the rodent liver is the synthesis
of muricholic acids, that along with TCA are major bile salts in rodent
bile. These trihydroxy bile salt species (and taurine-conjugated versions
thereof) have an identical molecular mass as cholic acid (and taurine-conjugated
versions thereof), and these isomeric species cannot be discriminated
using current IMS equipment. Hence, it is most likely that the signal
observed at m/z 514.28 corresponds
to multiple taurine-conjugated trihydroxy bile salts. The most abundant
molecular species observed in the connective tissue, parenchyma, and
bile duct of healthy dog and human liver were also observed in healthy
rat liver (Tables S2 and S3).

PCA
was performed on the MALDI-FTICR-MSI data sets of the healthy liver
specimens in order to determine the molecular profiles of each liver
region in the animal species studied.40 The top 10 of identified lipid classes were determined for the positive
and negative ion mode data sets (Tables S2 and S3, respectively) and classified by the following liver tissue
structures: bile duct lumen, bile duct, connective tissue, and parenchyma
(Table 1). Localization
of the most abundant lipid species for each of these regions is also
depicted in Figures 1, 2, and 4. The same
molecular classes were observed in the examined structures across
all species, the only difference was the pattern of bile salt conjugation.
In human and mild PSC liver tissue, both glycine- and taurine-conjugated
bile salt species were detected, whereas only taurine-conjugated bile
salts were apparent in dog and rat liver. Interestingly, in cases
of severe PSC, taurine conjugated bile salts, bilirubin (conjugated/unconjugated)
and sulfated bile salts/alcohols were present in the liver. Negative
ion mode was far more informative than positive ion mode, as the bile
salts and a wide range of lipids are more easily detected in negative
ion mode. In addition, the mass spectrum is less complicated as only
deprotonated ([M – H]−) species are present,
whereas in positive ion mode the spectrum is compounded by protonated
species ([M + H]+) and adducts of sodium ([M + Na]+) and potassium ([M + K]+). The positive ion MALDI-FTICR-MS
images from healthy dog and human liver, as well as diseased human
liver are shown in Figures S4, S6, and S7 respectively. In positive ion mode, a number of yet unknown molecular
species (ranging from m/z 544.24–592.24)
separated by 16 Da were detected in the bile duct lumen (data not
shown). No specific molecular species were observed in the bile duct
epithelium in positive ion mode.

Conclusions
Using MALDI-MSI, we
identified lipid-specific distributions in
different compartments of the liver in all three species (rat, dog,
and human), in both positive and negative ion mode. In the studied
liver specimens, bile salts were largely confined within the biliary
lumen. It will be interesting to examine the spatial distribution
of the distinct bile salt species in the setting of bile salt retention
as a consequence of intra- or extrahepatic bile duct obstruction.
(Hydroxylated)-sulfatides were identified as specific molecular marker
for the bile ducts and localized uniquely to bile duct epithelium.
Detection of 5-CS and G(C)DCA-S allowed the discrimination between
healthy human liver and liver from patients with severe PSC, and these
molecules could potentially be used as diagnostic markers. Experimental
links with inflammatory events warrants exploration of a possible
involvement of sulfatides in inflammatory cholangiopathies like PBC
and PSC.
