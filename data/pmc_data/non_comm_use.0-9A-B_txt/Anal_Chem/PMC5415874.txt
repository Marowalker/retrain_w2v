The inherent difficulty
of discovering new and effective antibacterials
and the rapid development of resistance particularly in Gram-negative
bacteria, illustrates the urgent need for new methods that enable
rational drug design. Here we report the development of 3D imaging
cluster Time-of-Flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS)
as a label-free approach to chemically map small molecules in aggregated
and single Escherichia coli cells,
with ∼300 nm spatial resolution and high chemical sensitivity.
The feasibility of quantitative analysis was explored, and a nonlinear
relationship between treatment dose and signal for tetracycline and
ampicillin, two clinically used antibacterials, was observed. The
methodology was further validated by the observation of reduction
in tetracycline accumulation in an E. coli strain expressing the tetracycline-specific efflux pump (TetA) compared
to the isogenic control. This study serves as a proof-of-concept for
a new strategy for chemical imaging at the nanoscale and has the potential
to aid discovery of new antibacterials.

==== Body
Gram-negative
bacterial pathogens
are increasingly resistant to the approved treatments,1,2 which has led to the use of drugs of last resort (e.g., colistin)
that are less safe and are also losing efficacy.3−5 These problems
are exacerbated by the slow rate of discovery and approval of new
effective treatments for antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial
infections.4,6,7 Gram-negative
pathogens are challenging targets for drug discovery largely because
promising antibiotics fail to accumulate to effective levels within
the intracellular compartment(s) of the cell.8−10 The accumulation
problem arises initially from an outer membrane permeability barrier
that restricts influx of large and/or hydrophobic molecules. Many
of the smaller, polar compounds that can penetrate this outer membrane
barrier through aqueous porins to the periplasm can then be ejected
from the cells by one or more tripartite resistance-nodulation-cell
division (RND) efflux pumps.8 The chemical
property space that is enriched for molecules that can traverse the
Gram-negative outer membrane through the aqueous porins is poorly
represented in typical high-throughput screening compound collections.11,12 The practical result of these problems is illustrated by the fact
that several classes of antibiotics in use for Gram-positive infections
(e.g., vancomycin and linezolid) have clinically relevant antibacterial
activity only against Gram-negative bacteria with compromised permeability
barriers and/or efflux systems.10,13

The ability to
measure compound uptake and accumulation into Gram-negative
bacteria is an essential step toward generating structure–activity
relationship models to guide rational drug design and optimization.9 There have been many approaches to this problem,
including monitoring of compounds via (1) enzymatic modification,14−16 (2) intrinsic fluorescence,17−20 and (3) radiolabels.21−24 Enzymatic modification is limited
to a few specific scaffolds. Radiolabeled assays are sensitive but
low-throughput and expensive because each compound must have a radiolabel
incorporated. There are many disadvantages to using fluorescence assays,
including the limited or complete absence of autofluorescence with
most compounds, low sensitivity, and difficulties with quantitation.
In the complex cellular environment, quenching of fluorescence emission
and bacterial autofluorescence can also interfere with fluorescent
compound detection. In addition, antibiotic treatment can alter bacterial
autofluorescence, which could further complicate analysis.25 Finally, attaching fluorophores to nonfluorescent
antibiotics could alter the accumulation parameters of the antibiotic
under study. There has been a recent interest in utilizing mass spectrometric
methods to provide insight into the drug localization challenge.26−28 When combined with liquid chromatography, sensitive assays of unlabeled
drug concentrations have been reported for cell populations, although
sample preparation strategies are quite involved and cannot provide
subcellular localizations, which would be relevant to target engagement.

Here we examine the application of imaging Time-of-Flight secondary
ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) as a label-free approach to tracking
endogenous and exogenous chemicals in a complex biological system,
a well-studied, rod-shaped Gram-negative pathogen, Escherichia coli. An E. coli cell is approximately 3.9 μm long and 1.3 μm in diameter
when grown in rich medium, comparable in size to a mitochondrion.29 The size of E. coli cells presents a serious challenge to acquiring the necessary spatial
resolution and sensitivity for imaging experiments. With imaging ToF-SIMS,
an energetic primary ion beam is focused to a submicron spot on the
target and ablates ionized material into a mass spectrometer. Two
types of ion beam systems are widely used in the field, atomic ion
beams and cluster ion beams. With atomic ion beams, an energetic beam
of monatomic ions is incident upon the target, with a spot diameter
as small as 30 nm. This beam destroys molecules in the near surface
region, resulting in detection of chemically nonspecific small fragment
ions. Chemical specificity is achieved using either isotope labeling
or metal ion incorporation.30 Several attempts
to chemically image metals, isotopes, and fragment ion signatures
for single E. coli cells have been
reported.31−34 With cluster ion beam, the primary ion beam consists of a molecular
cluster ion, which is capable of desorbing intact molecules with high
efficiency. These beams have three specific advantages over other
MS technologies used for molecular imaging. First, the ion beams can
be focused to a spot diameter of <300 nm.35,36 Second, as the sample is bombarded by the cluster, erosion occurs
at a rate of a few microns per hour.37 During
the erosion process, there is some chemical damage buildup, but mass
spectra characteristic of the composition of target can still be acquired.37,38 This mode of operation is referred to as molecular depth profiling.38 With model systems, a depth resolution of 30
nm has been achieved using C60+ projectiles.39 Third, by combining 2-dimensional imaging with
molecular depth profiling, a 3-dimensional molecular rendering is
feasible.40−43 This data cube contains a massive amount of information, including
mass spectra for all three coordinates of the image.

Here, we
apply cluster ToF-SIMS imaging to E. coli treated with ampicillin (AMP) and tetracycline (TET). These two
antibiotics target different subcellular compartments: the penicillin-binding
proteins in the periplasm of the bacterial cell envelope (AMP) and
the ribosomes in the bacterial cytoplasm (TET). The results show that,
for aggregates of cells, it is possible to obtain information about
the degree of drug localization through direct detection of the drug
molecular ion. Moreover, for single cells, we show that it is not
only possible to detect the presence of both AMP and TET, but with
a depth resolution of ∼200 nm, the differential localization
of the compounds can be observed. Finally, we compare the difference
in TET concentration in an E. coli strain
expressing the tetracycline-specific efflux pump (TetA) compared to
the isogenic control. The approach described here offers a powerful
new strategy for submicron chemical imaging of bacteria and demonstrates
its potential utility for measuring the intracellular accumulation
of exogenous compounds inside bacteria.

Materials and Methods
1 SIMS Characterization of Ampicillin and Tetracycline
Protocols for SIMS analysis of antibiotic standards is detailed
in Supporting Information, Section 1.

2 ToF-SIMS Imaging of AMP and TET-Dosed E. coli
E. coli Strains
E. coli K-12 BW251103 and isogenic
strain (JW5503–1,
ΔtolC732::kan) were purchased
from the Coli Genetic Stock Center at Yale University (New Haven,
CT). The plasmid containing the tetracycline resistance gene tetA, encoding a TET-specific efflux pump, and the vector
control include the origin of replication from pUC, a chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase gene, and a β-lactamase operon promoter for
expression of an inserted gene. The vector control contained the gene
coding for a truncated green fluorescent protein, and the TetA plasmid
contained tetA from pEX19Tc (accession number AF047519).
The plasmids were transformed into E. coli K-12 BW251103. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by broth
microdilution assays according to standard guidelines using cation-adjusted
Mueller-Hinton broth44 as well as in lysogeny
broth (LB, 10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, and 10 g NaCl) to match
the medium used in ToF-SIMS experiments. For E. coli K-12 BW251103, the minimum inhibitory concentration of TET in LB
shifted from 2 μg/mL for the vector control strain up to 64
μg/mL for the TetA strain, as expected.45

Sample Preparation of Aggregated and Isolated E. coli Cells on Si
The first goal was to
examine a single-layer aggregate of E. coli cells to evaluate drug detectability. E. coli was cultured on an LB agar plate (100 mm, TEKnova, Hollister, CA)
overnight in an incubator at 37 °C. Subsequently, a single colony
was cultured overnight in LB at 37 °C (250 mL package, TEKnova,
Hollister, CA) with agitation. The culture medium was diluted 1:5
with fresh medium and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Antibiotics
were then dosed at 7, 20, and 60 μg/mL in the culture medium
for 20 min at 37 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation
at 834 × g for 3 min, and then washed with deionized water and
centrifuged at 834 × g for 3 min. The wash step was performed
a total of four times at room temperature. A 10 μL aliquot of
resuspended, washed cells was directly spin-coated onto a clean silicon
wafer.46 Alternatively, a 10 μL aliquot
of resuspended, washed cells was then mixed with 0.1 M trehalose (1:1
v/v) and spin-coated onto a clean Si wafer. The samples were then
plunge frozen into liquid ethane and then swiftly transferred to liquid
nitrogen (LN2). Under the LN2, the samples were
loaded onto a precooled sample holder at 153 K in the vacuum followed
by freeze-drying for 4 h.

The second set of experiments was
developed to prepare isolated E. coli cells to evaluate the possibility of drug detection at the single
cell level. E. coli was cultured on
LB agar overnight as above. A single colony of E. coli was then selected and cultured in LB with a precleaned Si wafer
submerged for 4 h with agitation in an incubator at 37 °C, resulting
in a monolayer of bacteria with 20–30% coverage on Si as determined
by scanning electron microscopy (Figure S11). The LB was removed and replaced with fresh LB before compound
was added. The final concentrations of each compound were 7, 20, 60,
and 180 μg/mL in the culture medium. After 20 min of compound
treatment, the sample was washed quickly with deionized water four
times and gently blown dry using a stream of nitrogen gas for 3 s.
The samples were plunge frozen into liquid ethane and then swiftly
transferred to LN2. Under LN2, the samples were
loaded onto a precooled sample holder at 153 K followed by freeze-drying
for 4 h under a vacuum.

Cryo-SEM Characterization
To verify
cell morphology
and integrity, cells resulting from the various preparations were
subjected to cryo-scanning variable pressure, field emission scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) (Zeiss SIGMA VP-FESEM), with a beam energy
of 5 keV. The isolated E. coli on Si
was prepared as above and then dosed with 20 μg/mL TET or AMP
for time periods of 1, 5, 20, 40, and 60 min, or with 180 μg/mL
TET or AMP for 20 min, followed by plunge-freezing into liquid ethane,
and then transferred to LN2. The samples were transferred
to a precooled stage at 100 K and sputter-coated with ∼1 nm
of gold for SEM characterization. Each sample was examined at different
magnifications to reveal cell morphology changes induced by different
doses or times. The images are presented as Supporting Information in Figure S11.

ToF-SIMS Imaging
Imaging was performed using the J105
chemical imager. The C60+ primary ion beam was
restricted to a spot size of ∼300 nm in diameter using a 20
μm aperture inserted into the beam path before final focusing.
In this configuration, the maximum possible beam current is 0.5 pA.
A mass spectral image consisting of 65536 individual mass spectra
was created by scanning the beam over a field of view of 50 ×
50 μm2 with a 256 × 256 pixel density; correspondingly,
each pixel covers an area of 200 × 200 nm2. The dwell
time on each pixel was typically 50 ms, resulting in an image acquisition
time of ∼1 h and a total ion dose of ∼3 × 1014 ions/cm2, named one analysis cycle. Approximately
three analysis cycles were required to fully ablate the E. coli cells. Using the reported diameter of E. coli in similar growth conditions,29 this suggests that the each cycle corresponds
to an erosion depth of ∼400 nm.47 To display chemical images associated with a specific mass or masses,
two approaches are utilized. If the measured intensity of the secondary
ion of interest is low, so that many of the pixels exhibit no intensity,
it is assigned a specific color to indicate absence of the species.
When more than one molecule is involved, different colors are assigned
to the different species, and the resulting images are overlaid. If
the measured intensity of the secondary ion of interest extends over
a range of values, the pixel is assigned a color based on that intensity.

Data Analysis
All images were created using the Analyze software (version 1.0.08.14) developed by Ionoptika,
U.K. A mass window of 0.1 mass units wide centered at the known exact
mass of the target molecular ion was employed to select the desired
secondary ions and reduce interference from nearby peaks.

Secondary
ion statistical analyses were performed using ImagingSIMS, Version 3.6, a software package developed in-house and made freely
available.48 The procedure involved selecting
an area associated only with E. coli cell(s), summing up the measured signals originating from the analyte,
and calculating a weighted standard deviation of variance from area
to area. Values were calculated for both aggregated and isolated cells
using specific concentrations of drug and different strains of E. coli. The detailed procedure is described in the Supporting Information, Section 6.

Results
and Discussion
AMP and TET Detected in E.
coli Lysate
The first step in establishing
the feasibility of
imaging the TET and AMP distributions within E. coli was to acquire mass spectra of these molecules in their intrinsic
biological matrix. This step was necessary to estimate the limits
of detection in the actual cell, to determine whether the presence
of the complex environment of the cell creates inherent chemical interferences,
and to assess any ion suppression phenomenon that could impact quantitation.

To establish a reference point, each drug was dissolved into the
lysate of E. coli. The ToF-SIMS spectra
of 10 mg/mL TET-dosed and AMP-dosed E. coli lysates are shown in Figures S1 and S3, and the corresponding intensities as a function of drug concentration
are plotted in Figures S2 and S4. The characteristic
ions of TET (m/z 445.2 [M + H]+, 427.2 [M + H – H2O]+, and 410.1
[M – (OH)2]+; Figure S1) and AMP (m/z 350.1 [M
+ H]+ and 192.1 [M – C7H10O2S]+; Figure S3) were clearly seen in this complex matrix. Hence, there are multiple
MS peaks assigned to the two antibiotics that could be used for detection.
The fragment ions were likely from the insource fragmentation at this
stage, but in intact cells, AMP molecules that were hydrolyzed or
covalently bound to protein would be detected only as the fragment
ions. The lower detection threshold for TET was 1 μg/mL (Figure S2) and 10 μg/mL for AMP (Figure S4). The characteristic ion counts for
TET exhibited a proportional dose–response (R2 = 0.985–0.997) over a concentration range from
1 to 1000 μg/mL (Figure S2). The
proportional dose–response range (R2 = 0.776–0.981) for AMP ions was from 10 to 1000 μg/mL
(Figure S4). These results demonstrate
that the necessary sensitivity, specificity, and range of detection
can be obtained with cluster ToF-SIMS, which lays the foundation for
the direct detection of antibiotics in bacteria. A variety of other
antibiotics of different classes were also detected with ToF-SIMS
(Table S1).

Dose response of TET/AMP
in Single-Layer Aggregated E. coli Cells
With this confirmation that
TET and AMP can be detected with ToF-SIMS in E. coli lysate, we next evaluated whether these compounds could be detected
in intact dosed E. coli cells. Antibiotic-treated
bacteria were spin-coated onto Si, forming single-layer aggregates
to average out stochastic variations and to increase the coverage
on the Si surface, the signal density, and the number of cells imaged.49 A series of control experiments evaluating feasibility,
determining signal-to-noise, and measuring background are described
below.

Because depth profiling using the C60+ primary ion beam induces chemical damage to the target, the
stability of targeted antibiotics was investigated (Figure S5). TET signal declined to a steady state after the
initial C60+ etching, demonstrating the feasibility
of detecting TET with constant C60+ sputtering.
The sputter rate for E. coli cells
was also measured (Figure S6). Assuming
the E. coli cells have an average height
of 1.3 μm,29 it is estimated that
a 400 nm layer of the cells was etched away with the C60+ ion beam dose and duration used for the depth profiling
experiments.

To identify regions of the Si surface containing E. coli cells, the absence of Si signal and the presence
of unique E. coli-associated MS peaks
were used, as described in the Supporting Information, Section 5. The results show that Si and biological signals
of E. coli cells are complementary,
and therefore, the absence of Si signal can be used to identify areas
containing E. coli cells.

The
aggregated cells were then subjected to C60+ ToF-SIMS depth-profiling. The signals for Si and TET or AMP
were determined for each pixel at each depth, as shown in the color
overlay images (Figure 1). At a TET treatment dose of 20 μg/mL, the yellow TET signal
was nonoverlapping with the blue Si signal throughout the different
depths of the cell. This indicated that the TET signal was localized
to the single-layer E. coli cell aggregates.
Likewise, the pink AMP signal showed a similar correlation to the E. coli aggregates. To evaluate the background antibiotic
signal from Si regions of the treated and washed surface, the signal
level of TET or AMP (both dosed at 20 μg/mL) in E. coli regions was compared to Si regions (Table S2). These results showed 14-fold to 17-fold
more antibiotic signal in E. coli cellular
regions versus Si regions. At higher doses of antibiotics, a similar
or higher ratio was observed. The multiple depths imaged with ToF-SIMS
in Figure 1 offer direct
evidence that the antibiotics reside inside the E.
coli cells and are not merely associated with the
outer surface of the cells.

Figure 1 E. coli aggregates
treated with
TET (20 μg/mL) and AMP (20 μg/mL), underwent depth profiling
using the C60+ ion beam. The color overlay images
of Si (mapped by m/z 167.9, blue)
and TET (mapped by summing the molecular ion with fragments at m/z 410.1, 427.2, and 445.2, yellow) in
(a–c) and Si (mapped by m/z 167.9, blue) and AMP (mapped by summing the molecular ion, m/z 350.1, and fragment ion, m/z 192.1, pink) in (d–f), are shown at the
indicated depths from the top surface to 1200 nm below the surface.
The AMP and TET signals were clearly localized within the E. coli aggregates at each depth.

The average antibiotic MS signal from each pixel
within the E. coli aggregates (as determined
by the absence
of Si signal) was calculated for all layers of the depth profiling
in units of intensity per pixel and listed in Table 1. A nonlinear increase of the TET and AMP
signals was observed in the test dose range from 0 to 60 μg/mL.
The signal-to-noise level, characterized by the average antibiotic
signal per pixel in the antibiotic-dosed E. coli aggregates relative to untreated control E. coli aggregates, was approximately 7 for TET and 50 for AMP at a dose
of 7 μg/mL. The ability to detect AMP in cells dosed at 7 μg/mL,
at or below the lower threshold of detection of 10 μg/mL, as
determined in membrane-free lysate, may reflect enhanced accumulation
in living cells, perhaps due to the presence of target penicillin-binding
proteins and/or enhanced ionization efficiency in an intact cellular
context. The robust signal-to-noise suggests that the ToF-SIMS signal
detected was correctly attributed to the antibiotics. It is unclear
whether the nonlinear dose-dependent accumulation of antibiotics reflects
actual biological distribution or technical limitations. Nevertheless,
the results highlight the feasibility of cluster ToF-SIMS imaging
for chemical imaging of a complex biological system at the single
micron scale with submicron depth resolution.

Antibiotics are Located within E. coli at the Single Cell Level
With experience
gained from preparing
and analyzing the E. coli aggregates,
the next step was to grow a monolayer of cells directly on the Si
wafer. Other substrates were also tested, such as indium tin oxide-coated
glass, polytetrafluoroethylene and copper. Among all surfaces examined,
Si yielded the highest degree of reproducibility for E. coli growth and ToF-SIMS detection. The bacteria
were distributed as single cells or small groups on the substrate
after washing with deionized water. The cell integrity and morphology
after sample preparation designed for ToF-SIMS analysis were further
examined using Cryo-SEM. The results are shown in Figure S11 and confirm cell integrity with no obvious morphological
change after 20 min exposure to 20 μg/mL TET or AMP. Prolonged
antibiotic exposure led to cessation of bacterial growth, as expected.
In addition, prolonged AMP exposure, followed by the freezing protocol,
resulted in collapse of the E. coli cells, presumably due to weakening of the peptidoglycan as part
of the AMP mechanism of action.

With this optimized protocol,
localization of AMP and TET in single E. coli cells was examined. As shown in Figure 2, AMP-treated (20 μg/mL) E. coli cells were analyzed using a C60+ beam with ∼300 nm diameter. The outlines of individual
cells can be clearly seen in the total positive ion image in Figure 2a. The single ion
image in Figure 2b
shows the Si signal (green) on a black background. Together the total
positive ion signal and lack of green Si signal were consistent with
the presence of E. coli cells. In Figure 2c,d, the AMP molecular
ion at m/z 350.1 and fragment ion
at m/z 192.1 exhibited the same
distribution pattern. Overlaying colors for the Si signal and AMP
signal as in Figure 2e,f, illustrated nonoverlapping distribution and confirmed the colocalization
of AMP with E. coli cells. To rule
out the interference of noise in the detection of antibiotic, signal
counting was utilized to compare the background signal with the antibiotic
signal. As shown in Figure S12, five areas
with E. coli cells (green boxes) and
five areas without E. coli cells (black
boxes) were selected to calculate the signal counts from AMP, represented
by the molecular ion at m/z 350.1
and the fragment ion at m/z 192.1.
As shown in the right panel, the molecular ion at m/z 350.1 was detected from areas 1–5, with
an average of 3 ± 1 signal counts/pixel from the green boxes
(E. coli regions) compared to 0 signal
counts/pixel in the black boxes (Si only regions). The AMP fragment
ion at m/z 192.1 showed a more intense
signal level in the green boxes, of 14 ± 6 signal counts/pixel
compared to 1 signal counts/pixel in the black boxes. This data analysis
underestimated the levels of AMP because each green box contained
pixels devoid of bacterial signal. Nevertheless, this statistical
analysis suggests that AMP is detectable at the single cell level.

Figure 2 Total
and selected SIMS images show the localization of AMP signal
to individual E. coli cells. The bacteria
were cultured on Si and treated with 20 μg/mL AMP. The total
positive ion image in (a) shows the outline of the single bacteria
or their small clusters. The AMP molecular ion at m/z 350.1 in (d) and the fragment ion at m/z 192.1 in (c) are nonoverlapping with
Si in (b). The signal overlay images in (e) and (f) demonstrate colocalization
of AMP to E. coli, represented by the
black regions within the green background.

To three-dimensionally localize antibiotics in E.
coli, the sample was subjected to a simple form of
depth profiling. As shown in Figure 3, a plot of AMP signal intensity as a function of cell
depth revealed a decrease in signal level as the C60+ beam probed deeper into the cells. The inset color overlay
images of AMP (pink) and Si (blue) at each depth showed that the presence
of the AMP signal is nonoverlapping with Si, consistent with the presence
of E. coli. The AMP molecular ion signal
and the fragment ion signal were combined together to enhance the
signal. The AMP signal intensity at each layer indicates that AMP
was largely present in the first 400 nm depth from the surface of
each E. coli cell. This putative localization
is consistent with the periplasmic localization of penicillin-binding
proteins, the targets of AMP, and suggests that AMP did not reach
the same concentration in the cytoplasm as it did in the periplasmic
space. The 3D distribution of TET is also shown in Figure 4. The dosed TET (yellow) was
localized inside the individual E. coli cells (devoid of blue Si signal) and was detected not only at the
surface, but was found after the first 400 nm of material has been
removed. ToF-SIMS therefore holds the promise of being able to detect
exogenous compound localization to the periplasm and cytoplasm, raising
the possibility that subcellular accumulation can be compared within
scaffolds to inform structure–activity relationships.

The insets are color overlay images of AMP (mapped by summing
the molecular ion, m/z 350.1, and

Si (mapped by m/z 167.9, blue) signal
at different depths of AMP-treated (20 μg/mL) E. coli cells. The chemically resolved images at
different depths demonstrated AMP was predominantly located in the
first 400 nm depth of the E. coli cells.

Figure 4 Total and selected SIMS images show the localization
of TET signal
to individual E. coli. The bacteria
were cultured on Si and treated with 20 μg/mL TET. The total
positive ion images in (a, b) show the outline of bacteria undergoing
beam erosion from top surface to the depth of 800 nm. The distribution
of Si (mapped by m/z 167.9) and
TET (mapped by summing the molecular ion with fragments at m/z 410.1, 427.2, and 445.2) from top to
the depth of 800 nm are in (c)–(f). The signal overlay images
in (g) and (h) demonstrate colocalization of TET (yellow) to E. coli, represented by the black regions within
the Si (blue) background.

Effect of TetA Efflux Pump on TET Accumulation
To validate
the bacterial ToF-SIMS compound detection system, it would be of high
value to determine whether or not there is a correlation between subcellular
antibiotic accumulation in E. coli strains
and susceptibility to the antibiotics. One challenge is to account
for variation of individual cells, which may exhibit an inherently
different response due to stochastic fluctuations, for example, in
TetA efflux pump transcription and translation.

As a preliminary
experiment, antibiotics in E. coli were
interrogated by ToF-SIMS using an isogenic strain pair: E. coli containing a vector constitutively expressing
the TetA efflux pump or the vector control. The TetA efflux pump moves
TET from the cytoplasm into the periplasm, where it has no antibacterial
activity.45 Periplasmic TET can be further
removed from the periplasm by TolC-dependent efflux pumps or by diffusion
through porins, depending on the gradient. In E. coli K-12 BW251103, the constitutive expression of the TetA efflux pump
results in a 32-fold reduction in TET susceptibility, as measured
by a broth microdilution assay for antimicrobial activity.

The E. coli strains (vector control
and TetA) were incubated with TET at 20 and 180 μg/mL, washed,
frozen, and subjected to depth profiling as described above. The 20
μg/mL concentration was chosen because it was above the lower
threshold of detection and showed antimicrobial activity against the
vector control strain, but not the TetA expressing strain; 180 μg/mL
TET demonstrated activity against both strains. The results showed
that TET signal was present at all depths of both strains. A statistical
analysis of TET signal levels at each depth for the two strains is
shown in Table 2. In
both strains, TET signal was higher with higher doses of TET. At both
TET doses, the average TET signal per pixel was higher in the E. coli vector control cells than in the cells expressing
the TetA efflux pump in the first 400 nm depth of the cells. The trend
was the same for the 400–800 nm depth. Although there was a
clear bias toward a higher signal in the vector control cells, the
values are not statistically different at the 1σ uncertainly
level. Whether these data are influenced by stochastic fluctuations
associated with the cells themselves, or by simple statistical uncertainty,
is not yet clear. At this point, the signal levels are too low to
be able to elucidate stochastic effects versus biological differences
with statistical certainty, but there may be enough response to suggest
that cell-to-cell variations may be eventually examined using this
approach.

Conclusion and Outlook
We report
the first direct localization of unlabeled antibiotic
molecules in single E. coli cells.
We show a dose–response of TET and AMP in E.
coli cell aggregates using cluster ToF-SIMS imaging.
The imaging provided evidence that both antibiotics were localized
within the E. coli cells. The data
indicated a nonlinear increase of antibiotic signal in response to
increased exposure in E. coli cell
aggregates. The observation was further validated by comparison of
TET accumulation in isogenic E. coli strains differing in TET susceptibility due to the presence or absence
of TET-specific efflux by TetA. For this pair of strains, TET accumulation
measured with ToF-SIMS was consistent with the function of TetA efflux
in reduced susceptibility to TET.

The methodology described
here lays the groundwork for the study
of compound localization in subcellular compartments using cluster
ToF-SIMS imaging, the only label-free technique to track endogenous
and exogenous small molecules in complex biological systems with high
spatial resolution and high sensitivity. The analysis shown here may
be able to guide the structure–activity relationship of compound
accumulation and disposition in bacteria, for which no models currently
exist.50 The ability of ToF-SIMS to detect
compounds in bacteria, the approximate size of mitochondria, represents
a significant technological advance beyond applying ToF-SIMS imaging
to mammalian cells.51,52 The development of low-damage
gas cluster ion beams and further enhancement in ionization capability
could expand the opportunities for this technique as a valuable analytical
tool for biological and pharmaceutical sciences.
