High-performance liquid chromatography
was used in combination
with infrared ion spectroscopy for the identification of positional
isomers of hydroxy-atorvastatins, the primary metabolites of the drug
atorvastatin. The results demonstrate the direct applicability of
infrared ion spectroscopy in the field of drug metabolism and, more
generally, its promising role in state-of-the-art analytical laboratories
for the identification of small molecules buried in complex mixtures.
In combination with chromatographic separation, infrared spectroscopy
of mass-selected ions provides a promising new route for the identification
of the molecular structures of unknown m/z peaks in a mass spectrum. We demonstrate that currently
existing experimental protocols allow the measurement of an IR spectrum
from less than 10 ng of sample obtained in a collected HPLC fraction.

==== Body
The study
of drug metabolism,
i.e., the degradation of a compound in the body, is an important component
of the drug development process. Predominantly, different mass spectrometric
(MS) techniques are used in combination with liquid chromatography
(LC) for the separation and identification of drug metabolites. However,
the localization of the exact site of a metabolic biotransformation
by mass spectrometric analysis alone is often challenging or impossible
since regioisomeric metabolites are frequently indistinguishable on
the basis of their MS/MS product ion data, e.g., positional isomers
with a site of metabolic modification on an aromatic ring.1 Therefore, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
is often needed for the complete identification of a metabolite structure.
However, this technique requires large amounts (typically >5–100
μg) of sample in high purity.2 Since
the metabolite can often only be extracted from biological (in vitro
or in vivo) matrixes, this involves a time-consuming and complex purification
process. The latter is currently the main bottleneck for more regular
use of NMR for the identification of drug metabolites.1−3

The combination of mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy,
known as infrared ion spectroscopy (IR-IS), is well established as
a powerful tool for the elucidation of molecular structures and conformations
of gas phase ions.4−7 Using the combination of state-of-the-art commercial ion trap mass
spectrometry platforms8−10 with intense and tunable infrared lasers, such as
user facility-based free electron lasers (FELs)11,12 and table top optical parametric oscillators,13−15 an infrared
spectrum can be generated for ions at any m/z peak in a mass spectrum.

IR-IS has the potential
to become a very valuable alternative for
structural elucidation by NMR in many cases.16 Since the technique is based on detection by mass spectrometry,
with its well-known selectivity and sensitivity, it can provide full
structure information from one simple LC/MS or MS analysis and overcomes
the tedious metabolite purification needed for NMR. Since less material
is needed for the analysis, also less in vitro and/or in vivo sample
needs to be produced, resulting in the use of fewer animals. Also,
unstable metabolites that are hard or impossible to extract and purify
can be measured using IR ion spectroscopy.

Recent examples of
modified commercial ion trap mass spectrometers
used for IR-IS measurements enable sensitivity down to the low nanomolar
regime and require ∼50 μL of sample solution per IR spectrum.8 This sensitivity thus enables the measurement
of IR spectra of ions that are components of collected HPLC fractions
by direct infusion electrospray ionization (ESI). Here, we demonstrate
the combination of HPLC and IR-IS and apply it for the identification
of molecular structures in the field of drug metabolism. Atorvastatin
is an extensively studied HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor used as a lipid-lowering
drug.17,18 Its primary metabolism pathway is through
cytochrome P450 3A4 hydroxylation, giving active ortho- and para-hydroxylated
metabolites that in fact account for a significant portion of the
HMG-CoA reductase activity.19 Incubation
of atorvastatin in human liver microsomes showed two major metabolites
that were separated and collected by HPLC and identified as the ortho-
and para-hydroxy metabolites on the basis of their IR spectra measured
using IR-IS.

Methods
Chemicals and Materials
Atorvastatin was purchased
from Sequoia Research Products (Pangbourne, United Kingdom). The metabolites,
o- and p-hydroxylated atorvastatin, were obtained from TLC PharmaChem
(Ontario, Canada). Methanol and acetonitrile were supplied by Merck
(Darmstadt, Germany); formic acid (0.1% in water) was provided by
Biosolve (Valkenswaard, The Netherlands), and the dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) used during sample preparation was from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).
All LC solvents were HPLC grade.

Sample Preparation
Atorvastatin was incubated at 10
μM for 120 min in human liver microsomes with a final protein
concentration of 1 mg/mL. The cell incubations (500 μL) were
extracted with DMSO (500 μL), vortexed, sonicated, and centrifuged
for 10 min at 16 060g. A 100 μL aliquot
of the resulting supernatant was injected for analysis.

LC Fractionation
An Acquity i-class UPLC system (Waters,
Manchester, UK), equipped with an Acquity FTN sample manager and an
Acquity PDA detector, was coupled to a Gilson PrepFC sample collector
(Middleton, USA). The separation was performed on a 150 × 3 mm
Uptisphere Strategy C18-2 column (Interchim, Montluçon, France)
packed with 2.2 μm particles and kept at a temperature of 60
°C. Elution started with a linear gradient at a flow rate of
0.8 mL/min from 95% solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and 5% solvent
B (acetonitrile/methanol 80/20; v/v%) to 30% solvent A and 70% solvent
B over 10 min, increased further to 100% B in 0.1 min, and was kept
at 100% B for 2 min. The column eluent first passed through the PDA
detector and was subsequently fractionated every 6 s into a 96-well
plate. Afterward, the fractions (80 μL) corresponding to the
peaks of interest were pooled. The collections corresponded to 57,
106, and 120 ng of peaks A, B, and C, respectively (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Hydroxy-atorvastatins
are separable by HPLC (panel I) but indistinguishable
on the basis of their MS/MS spectra (panel II).

Infrared Ion Spectroscopy
IR-IS measurements were performed
in a modified quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (Bruker, AmaZon
Speed ETD) coupled to the beamline of the FELIX IR-FEL. Details of
the hardware modifications and of software operation have been previously
reported.8,20 Collected HPLC fractions were directly electrosprayed
(+ESI) to produce IR/mass spectra. All reference measurements were
generated by +ESI from solutions of 10–7 M in 50:50
MeOH/H2O. The FELIX free electron laser generates infrared
radiation as 5–10 μs macropulses at a 10 Hz repetition
rate having ∼40 mJ pulse energy and a bandwidth of ∼0.4%
of the center frequency.

In contrast to classical absorption
IR spectroscopy, IR-IS is a form of action spectroscopy in which infrared
absorption is monitored by observation of the photodissociation it
induces. IR photons are absorbed when they are resonant with a vibration
of the trapped ions, resulting in an increase in internal energy.
Intramolecular vibrational redistribution of the absorbed energy causes
ions to dissociate once they reach the limit of the dissociation channel
having the lowest threshold. Typically, after a single IR macropulse,
dissociation occurs. Relating the parent and fragment ion intensities
(IR yield = ΣI(fragment ions)/ΣI(parent + fragment ions)) as the IR frequency is tuned
generates an infrared vibrational spectrum. The yield at each IR point
is typically obtained from four to eight averaged mass spectra, and
the frequency is calibrated online throughout the measurements using
a grating spectrometer.

Results and Discussion
As detailed
above, atorvastatin (10 μM) was incubated in
human liver microsomes for 120 min to generate the relevant metabolites
which were separated by HPLC and the relevant fractions were collected.
Demonstrated in Figure 1, the two isobaric metabolites, while separable by HPLC (panel I),
are unidentifiable on the basis of their MS/MS product ion spectra
showing identical product ions with identical relative abundances
(panel II). The structures of atorvastatin and the two hydroxylated
metabolites are illustrated in Figure 2. Using instead the HPLC/IR-IS approach, we are able
to first separate the two hydroxylated metabolites using HPLC and
then identify them on the basis of their readily distinguishable IR
spectra. Using direct infusion +ESI, the ions were generated from
the collected HPLC fractions. These results are illustrated in panels
I–III of Figure 2. Note that these metabolites are distinguishable by their vibrational
signatures in both the 1000–1900 cm–1 spectral
region (measured using the FELIX IR FEL) and the 3200–3700
cm–1 spectral region (measured using a table top
IR optical parametric oscillator laser source, LaserVision, USA).
Using identical experimental (MS and IR laser) conditions, distinction
can be made on both the basis of line positions (for example, peak
splitting in the regions of ∼1250 and 3650 cm–1) and differences in IR fragment yields (intensities) since both
properties of the IR spectra are highly reproducible.

Figure 2 Panels I and II present
IR spectra (colored traces) generated for
ions at m/z 575 from LC fractions
A and B and the identification of isobaric drug metabolites based
on IR spectral match with reference compounds (black traces). Panel
III highlights the difference in IR spectra of the two isomeric metabolites.
Panel IV contains the IR spectrum measured for unmetabolized atorvastatin
(peak C in LC chromatogram presented in Figure 1).

From the HPLC experiments, fractions were collected containing
the relevant metabolites at ∼300 nM and IR measurements were
obtained in duplicate in both spectral regions from a single collected
fraction. Note that these amounts of sample are directly compatible
with the standard operating protocols of the experiment8 since the measurement of one IR spectrum typically
takes 10–20 min using ESI flow rates of ∼2 μL/min
and concentrations ranging from nM to μM (in this case, corresponding
to less than 10 ng of sample consumption per IR spectrum). Such experimental
conditions compare very favorably against the alternative use of NMR
spectroscopy for such an identification, maintaining the sensitivity
and selectivity inherent to mass spectrometry while providing orthogonal
identification on the basis of retention time, mass-to-charge, and
IR spectral fingerprint.

Comparison of the IR-IS spectra from
the HPLC fractions to IR-IS
spectra of the pure reference compounds recorded under the same conditions
(see black traces in panels I and II of Figure 2) shows that identical IR spectra are generated
independently of the purity and concentration of the sample due to
the selectivity of the MS. A particularly interesting perspective
of the current approach is to rely on quantum–chemically calculated
IR spectra in place of reference IR measurements, unlocking the potential
of reference-free identification of unknowns in cases where model
compounds are not commercially or synthetically available.21−23 This is hardly possible from MS/MS or LC data as CID fragmentation
propensities and retention times are hard or even impossible to reliably
compute. On the other hand, IR spectral predictions from quantum–chemical
calculations are rapidly approaching experimental accuracy. Additionally,
information on the functional groups contained in an unknown molecule
is contained in its IR spectrum. For example, the IR features at approximately
3650 cm–1 in panels I and II of Figure 2 are a strong indication of
OH functionality. Identification of specific functional groups in
a molecule can be, for example, useful for narrowing down a list of
isobaric compounds in a database search. In the case of coeluting
isobaric compounds, a composite IR spectrum of all species is obtained.
However, if specific spectral contributions from each compound are
sufficiently distinct (in terms of frequency), deconvolution is often
possible. Moreover, for compounds showing different fragmentation,
unique IR spectra can be generated for each isobaric precursor by
monitoring specific fragment ions

Currently, only a few laboratories
worldwide possess the MS and
IR laser infrastructure to conduct routine IR-IS experiments. This
is mainly a result of the limited availability of FELs and the low
output power and limited tuning ranges of OPOs. However, several FEL
facilities (including FELIX) are open to external researchers. Moreover,
with the ongoing introduction of new mid-IR laser sources (such as
external cavity tunable quantum cascade lasers), implementation of
affordable benchtop IR-IS techniques in state-of-the-art analytical
laboratories for small molecule identification is quickly becoming
a reality. This is especially exciting for online screening approaches
in HPLC/MS analyses using a limited IR frequency range.
