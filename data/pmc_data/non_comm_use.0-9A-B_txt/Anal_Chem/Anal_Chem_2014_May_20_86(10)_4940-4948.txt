SocietyA novel photo-oxidative cross-linking
between two histidines (His-His)
has been discovered and characterized in an IgG1 antibody via the
workflow of XChem-Finder, 18O labeling and mass spectrometry
(Anal. Chem. 2013 , 85 , 5900 −5908 23634697 ). Its structure was elucidated by peptide
mapping with multiple proteases with various specificities (e.g.,
trypsin, Asp-N, and GluC combined with trypsin or Asp-N) and mass
spectrometry with complementary fragmentation modes (e.g., collision-induced
dissociation (CID) and electron-transfer dissociation (ETD)). Our
data indicated that cross-linking occurred across two identical conserved
histidine residues on two separate heavy chains in the hinge region,
which is highly flexible and solvent accessible. On the basis of model
studies with short peptides, it has been proposed that singlet oxygen
reacts with the histidyl imidazole ring to form an endoperoxide and
then converted to the 2-oxo-histidine (2-oxo-His) and His+32 intermediates, the latter is
subject to a
nucleophilic attack by the unmodified histidine; and finally, elimination
of a water molecule leads to the final adduct with a net mass increase
of 14 Da. Our findings are consistent with this mechanism. Successful
discovery of cross-linked His-His again demonstrates the broad applicability
and utility of our XChem-Finder approach in the discovery and elucidation
of protein cross-linking, particularly without a priori knowledge of the chemical nature and site of cross-linking.

==== Body
Protein cross-links are ubiquitous
in biological systems and biopharmaceuticals. They are also involved
in disease pathologies such as Alzheimer1−3 and cataractogenesis.2,4 As one of the post-translational modifications and degradations
that occur during biopharmaceutical protein production processing
and storage, cross-links have been reported to result in aggregation,
loss of bioactivity, and immunogenicity.5−7

Despite the rapid
advancements in mass spectrometry and data analysis
algorithms, characterization of protein cross-links remains challenging
due to their structural complexity.8 Whereas
a limited set of cross-linked structures (e.g., thioether7,9−12) have been characterized, most remain unknown; for example, the
nondisulfide covalent cross-linking in crystalline,4,13,14 collagen,15 ubiquitylated
proteins,3 ribonuclease A,16 and monoclonal antibodies.17,18 It is particularly
challenging to characterize protein cross-linking without prior knowledge
of the chemical nature and sites of cross-linking as no theoretical
mass or spectrum can be predicted. In contrast, numerous chemical
cross-links with well-established cross-linking chemistry have been
used in the investigation of protein structures and protein–protein
interactions.19−25 Since predefined cross-linking chemistry is involved, various specialized
algorithms have been developed for data analysis for each incorporated
cross-link. Naturally, these approaches are less amenable to the identification
of cross-links with undefined cross-linking chemistry. Recently, we
developed a workflow, XChem-Finder, that is generally applicable for
protein cross-linking. It involves, first, the detection of cross-linked
peptides via the unique isotope patterns imparted by 18O-labeling of their two termini (in comparison, one terminus for
a linear peptide), and then integrated mass spectrometric and data
analysis.8

IgG1
and IgG2 are the most popular therapeutic monoclonal antibodies
on the market.26 Applying our XChem-Finder
workflow, we have discovered and characterized a novel histidine-histidine
(His-His) cross-link in IgG1 antibody. High molecular weight species
in the light-irradiated IgG1 were detected by reduced SDS-PAGE and
size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Our LC–MS analysis indicated
that cross-linking occurred across two identical conserved histidine
residues (His220) on two separate heavy chains in the hinge region,
which is highly flexible and solvent accessible. The cross-linking
chemistry is consistent with the proposed mechanism based on model
peptides under photo-oxidative conditions (see Scheme 1).16,27−29 Successful
discovery of the His-His cross-link in IgG1 has further demonstrated
the general applicability and power of our XChem-Finder workflow.
To the best of our knowledge, our work reported herein is the first
example of such cross-linking in a protein.

Intermediates
Experimental Section
Chemicals
All chemicals were reagent grade or above.
Guanidine hydrochloride (GndHCl), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA), dithiothreitol (DTT), iodoacetic acid (IAA), trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA), acetonitrile (ACN), HPLC-grade water, and bradykinin were
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Sequencing grade trypsin, GluC,
and Asp-N were from Roche (Indianapolis, IN). 18O-water
(97%) was from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). Recombinant
monoclonal IgG1 antibody (antistreptavidin immunoglobulin gamma 1)
was produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Amgen, Thousand
Oaks, CA), purified according to standard manufacturing procedures,
formulated at a concentration of 30 mg/mL in 50 mM sodium acetate
at pH 5.2, and stored at −70 °C.

Generation of Stressed
Sample
After being exchanged
into various buffers of biopharmaceutical interest (50 mM sodium acetate
at pH 4.8, 50 mM sodium phosphate at pH 7.4, 50 mM sodium bicarbonate
at pH 9.0 or water), the IgG1 antibody at a concentration of 5 mg/mL
in a clear 3 mL glass vial was put into a light chamber (Atlas Suntest
CPS+ with Xenon Lamp and ID65 solar filter, controlled irradiance
at 300–800 nm, light intensity at 765 W/m2) and
exposed to light irradiation for 7, 14, and 22 h. These conditions
represent the light irradiance of 1×, 2×, and 3× ICH
(International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements
for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use), respectively.

Aggregates by Size Exclusion Chromatography
Size exclusion
chromatography (SEC) analysis for reduced IgG was carried out as described.30 Briefly, IgG1 was diluted to 1 mg/mL in a denaturing
buffer (7.5 M Gnd-HCl, 2 mM EDTA and 0.25 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) at room
temperature. Reduction was accomplished by 10 mM DTT at room temperature
for 30 min. Then 50 μL of the above samples was injected onto
a TSKgel G3000 SWXL column (7.8 mm × 300 mm, 5 μm)
with an isocratic mobile phase of 0.1% TFA/H2O–ACN
(80:20) and a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The column was set at room
temperature, and the UV detector was at 280 nm.

Reduction,
Alkylation, Tryptic Digestion and 18O-Labeling
of IgG1
IgG1 was digested by trypsin similarly to the procedure
described by Ren et al.31 Briefly, IgG1
was diluted to 1 mg/mL in a denaturing buffer (7.5 M GndHCl, 2 mM
EDTA, and 0.25 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) to a final volume of 0.5 mL. Reduction
was accomplished with the addition of 3 μL of 0.5 M DTT followed
by 30 min incubation at room temperature. S-Carboxymethylation was
achieved with the addition of 7 μL of 0.5 M IAA, and the resulting
mixture was incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 min.
Excess IAA was quenched with the addition of 4 μL of 0.5 M DTT.
The reduced and alkylated IgG1 samples were subsequently exchanged
into the digestion buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl at pH 7.5) using a NAP-5
size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Next, two aliquots
(200 μL each) were completely dried via SpeedVac and reconstituted
separately into the same volume of 18O-water or 16O-water; then 6 μL of 1 mg/mL trypsin in 18O-water
or 16O-water solution, respectively, was added to achieve
a 1:25 (w/w) enzyme/substrate ratio. The reaction mixtures were incubated
at 37 °C for 30 min.

Other proteolytic digestions of IgG1
(Asp-N, Trypsin combined with GluC, and Asp-N combined with GluC)
were performed in 16O-water only. Proteases were added
to 100 μL of the above buffer-exchanged antibody to achieve
a 1:25 (w/w) enzyme/substrate ratio. The reaction mixtures were incubated
at 37 °C overnight.

Limited Asp-N digestion was performed
by adding 6 μg of Asp-N
into a 300 μL digest (of trypsin combined with GluC) and incubating
at 37 °C for 1.5 h for LC/CID-MS analysis. An aliquot of 200
μL of the above digest was dried via SpeedVac and reconstituted
into 40 μL of water for LC/ETD-MS analysis.

RP-HPLC
The proteolytic digests of IgG1 (25 μL)
were separated on a Jupiter C5 column (250 mm × 2.0 mm, 5 μm,
300 Å, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) at 50 °C with a flow rate
of 200 μL/min on a HPLC system (Agilent 1100, Palo Alto, CA).
Mobile phase A was 0.1% TFA in water (v/v), while mobile phase B contained
0.085% TFA in 90% ACN/10% water. A gradient was applied by holding
at 2% B for 2 min, increasing to 22% B in 38 min, then 42% B in 80
min, then 100% B in 25 min followed by holding at 100% B for 5 min.
The column was re-equilibrated at 2% B for 30 min prior to next injection.

For ETD analysis, digests of IgG1 (6 μL) were separated on
a PROTO C4 column (150 mm × 1.0 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å, Higgins
Analytical, Mountain View, CA) at 50 °C with a flow rate of 60
μL/min on a HPLC system (Agilent 1100, Palo Alto, CA). Mobile
phase A was 0.1% FA/0.02% TFA in water (v/v) while mobile phase B
contained 0.1% FA/0.02% TFA in 90% ACN/10% water. The same gradient
as described above was applied.

Mass Spectrometry
An LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) was used in-line with a HPLC
system for the analyses of the IgG1 proteolytic digests. A full MS
scan (with 60 000 resolution at m/z 400 and an automatic gain control (AGC) target value of
2 × 105) followed by data-dependent MS/MS scans of
the three most abundant precursor ions was set up to acquire both
the peptide mass and sequence information. The spray voltage was 5.5
kV, and the capillary temperature was 250 °C. The instrument
was tuned using the doubly charged ion of a synthetic peptide, bradykinin.
The MS/MS spectra were obtained using CID with a normalized collision
energy of 35%. For MS/MS with ion detection in the Orbitrap, the AGC
target was set to 3 × 106, resolution to 7 500,
and the precursor isolation width to 4 m/z unit. Under our experimental conditions, the typical mass
accuracy in full MS scan and FT MS/MS is 5 and 10 ppm, respectively.

ETD spectra were acquired on a Thermo-Scientific LXQ-XL mass spectrometer
in centroid mode with an isolation width of 5, reaction time of 75
ms, and reagent target value of 1 × 105, using singly
charged fluoranthene anions as the ETD reagent. Both CID and ETD data
were analyzed for peptide identification, using a custom-written algorithm
MassAnalyzer and verified manually.32−35

Results and Discussion
A novel His-His cross-link in proteins has been discovered via
our XChem-Finder workflow, without predefined cross-linking chemistry.
Peptide mapping with mass spectrometry has established that the cross-link
occurred across two identical His220 on each of the two heavy chains
in the hinge region.

Detection of Cross-Linked Protein
Photoinduced nonreducible
high molecular weight species were detected by reducing SDS-PAGE;
their intensities increased with longer light exposure (Figure S1A
in the Supporting Information). Their formation
was pH-dependent: less favorable under acidic conditions, such as
pH ∼5 for typical formulation of proteins (Figure S1B in the Supporting Information), and more favorable in
neutral or basic buffers that are commonly used in protein production
and purification (Figure S1B in the Supporting
Information). The cross-linked species were also quantified
by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Figure S1C, D in the Supporting Information). Mobile phase of 0.1%
TFA/H2O–ACN (80:20) was used to avoid hydrophobic
interaction with the stationary phase.30 The results from SEC and SDS-PAGE were consistent. The total amounts
of the early elution peaks observed were at the level of 0.2, 4.5,
9.5, and 16.5% by peak area in the control sample and samples exposed
to 1×, 2×, 3× ICH irradiation, respectively (Figure
S1C in the Supporting Information). The
cross-links were also observed to increase to 25.8% in 50 mM NaHCO3 pH 9.0, 15.7% in 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4, and 6.3%
in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 4.8. It is interesting to note that the
control sample (without light stress) already contained small yet
detectable amount of cross-linking (0.4%, Figure S1D in the Supporting Information), suggesting such modifications
could occur during routine protein production and process. The chemical
nature and site of cross-linking was discovered by our XChem-Finder
workflow as detailed next.8

Detection of
Cross-Linked Peptide
Tryptic digestion
in 18O-water results in the incorporation of two 18O atoms in each of the newly generated C-termini;36,37 hence, two 18O atoms for a linear tryptic peptide (with
one C-terminus) and four 18O atoms for a cross-linked peptide
(with two C-termini).38−40 As shown in Figure S2-1 in the Supporting Information, the isotopic distribution of the peptide
at m/z 1673.54 (quadruply charged,
monoisotopic mass 6687.149 Da) shows a mass shift of 8 Da (i.e., four 18O) in 18O-water compared to that from 16O-water, indicating it contains two C-termini and is a cross-linked
peptide.

Elucidation of Cross-Linking Chemistry
The cross-linked
peptide m/z 1673.54 underwent FT
MS/MS analysis. As described in our previous paper,8 the fragment ions obtained were searched against the amino
acid sequence of the IgG1 via FindPept to match all possible peptide
fragments, see Table S1 in the Supporting Information. On the basis of the peptide ladders observed, a partial sequence
K218–K244 (KTHTCPPCPAPELLGGPSVFLFPPKPK, see
Table S1 in the Supporting Information)
was identified. Then, the partial sequence was extended to a putative
full-length tryptic peptide S215–K244 (SCDKTHTCPPCPAPELLGGPSVFLFPPKPK,
3336.587 Da). Since the fragment ions only matched this single peptide,
we surmised that cross-linking occurred across the two identical peptides.
The combined mass of the two unmodified (native) peptides is 6673.174
Da, which also satisfies the mass limitation conferred by the observed
mass of the cross-linked peptide (6687.149 Da, see Table S2 in the Supporting Information).

In order to elucidate
the cross-linking chemistry, elemental composition analysis of the
cross-link was performed as illustrated in Table S2 in the Supporting Information. The mass difference between
the sum of the two native peptide chains and observed mass of the
cross-linked peptide is 13.975 Da, for which three potential formula
(O–2H, N, or CH2) were proposed. From a chemistry
perspective, it is difficult to add just one nitrogen atom or a CH2 group. On the other hand, addition of one oxygen atom coupled
with the loss of two hydrogen atoms (O–2H) indicates oxidation.
The putative peptide chain K218–K244 contains His, of which
oxidation and cross-linking have been reported.28,29 In addition, the formula O–2H gives the lowest mass error
(0.004 Da). Therefore, a potential His-His cross-linking structure
is proposed as illustrated in Table S2 in the Supporting Information and Figure 1 and verified as described next.

Figure 1 CID MS/MS spectra of the quadruply charged
precursor ions m/z 1673.54 (16O-labeled C-termini)
and 1675.54 (18O-labeled C-termini) of the cross-linked
tryptic peptide S215–K244/S215–K244. Characteristic
mass shift imparted by the heavier isotope 18O was observed
(e.g., the mass shift of 4 Da for y5 ions in 16O- vs 18O-water, 566.53 vs 570.53). The y27* ion results from cleavage
of the His-His bond while the y27 ion contains the cross-linking site.
MS3 spectrum of the y27* ion (m/z 1488.35) is shown in Figure S2-3 in the Supporting
Information.

Structural Confirmation
by Mass Spectrometry
First,
the calculated mass of the His-His cross-linked peptide (6687.153
Da) is in good agreement with the observed mass (6687.149 Da, mass
error 0.6 ppm, see Table 1). Second, the series
of b- and y-ions are highly consistent with the proposed structure
(Figure 1). The observed y-ions from y5 to
y24 and the b5 ions correspond to fragment ions with no cross-linking
site, while the y-ions from y27 and the b-ions from b13 to b24 are
from fragments that contain the cross-linked histidine residues. These
data support cross-linking at His 220. Moreover, y27* ion (in blue)
and b8* ion (in blue) are peptide fragments resulting from cleaving
the bond connecting the two cross-linked histidine residues (see Figure 1). The missed cleavage by trypsin at Lys218 is likely
due to its close proximity to the cross-linking site at His220, reminiscent
of similarly missed cleavages in the case of thioether cross-linking.9 The second missed cleavage at Lys242 is likely
due to the presence of adjacent proline residues. The two missed tryptic
cleavages in the cross-linked peptide would have been especially challenging
to handle by traditional database-dependent algorithms, again highlighting
the utility of our XChem-Finder workflow.8,41,42

Additional Confirmation
by 18O/16O-Isotope
Fragment Ions Pattern
Since the fragment ions containing
no (zero), one, or two C-termini of the cross-linked peptides displayed
a mass shift of 0, 4, and 8 Da, respectively, in the corresponding
MS/MS spectra obtained from 18O- and 16O-water,
the examination of mass shift of fragment ions can lend further support
for the assignment of fragment ions. For example, as shown in Figure 1, b-ions prior to the cross-linking site (e.g.,
b5) have no mass shift between the 18O-water and 16O-water digests. On the other hand, the y-ions without the cross-linking
site (e.g., y5) gave a mass shift of 4 Da. All assignments were verified
by their distinct mass shift in 18O, depending on the number
of C-termini they contain.

Additional Confirmation by MS3 Analysis
Several abundant fragment ions shown in Figure 1 were selected for MS3 analysis which
simplified and further
confirmed data interpretation. For example the fragment ion m/z 1488.35 shown in Figure 1 could not be assigned initially, so it was selected for MS3 analysis (Figure S2-3 in the Supporting
Information). The analysis established that it was the y27*
ion (in blue) generated from cleaving the bond connecting the two
cross-linked histidine residues.

Peptide Mapping with Multiple
Proteases
Since this
is the first report of His-His cross-linking in a protein, peptide
mapping with additional proteases was carried out to glean complementary
data.43,44 In additional to trypsin, proteases with
different sequence specificity (e.g., Asp-N45−47 or GluC48) and combined proteases (e.g., trypsin with
GluC, and Asp-N with GluC) were employed. Additional cross-linked
peptides containing His220 were detected and analyzed: D217-K224/D217-K224
from Asp-N, S215-E229/S215-E229 from trypsin with GluC, and D217-E229/D217-E229
from Asp-N and GluC, respectively. In each case, the observed mass
was in good agreement with its theoretical mass with mass errors ranging
from 0.0 to 0.6 ppm (see Table 1). The y- and
b-ions were also consistent with the corresponding structure (Figure 2 and Figures S3-1 and S5-1 in the Supporting Information). Similar to the tryptic peptide, the
cross-linking site and chemistry were further supported by the presence
of several ions generated from cleaving the bond connecting the two
cross-linked histidine residues, such as the doubly charged ion at m/z 880.67, the singly charged ion at m/z 1773.77, and the singly charged ion
at m/z 992.52 (b8*) shown in Figure 2 (all highlighted in blue).

the triply charged precursor ion m/z 1178.77 of the cross-linked S215-E229/S215-E229
peptide generated from combined trypsin and GluC digestion. The b8*
ion results from cleavage of the His-His bond while the b8 ion contains
the cross-linking site.

ETD MS/MS Analysis
As an alternative fragmentation
technique, ETD provides sequence information complementary to that
obtained from CID by cleaving a peptide backbone in a less selective
manner than CID.34,49,50 Higher charge state ions usually generate more effective ETD fragmentation;50 therefore, formic acid instead of TFA was used
in the mobile phase to increase charge state for more effective ETD
fragmentation and to minimize ion suppression. All ETD MS/MS spectra
were collected with supplemental activation and dominated by charge
reduced species. The charge states of 5, 6, 4, and 4 for the peptide
S215–K244/S215–K244, D217–K244/D217–K244,
S215–E229/S215–E229, and D217–E229/D217–E229,
respectively, offered optimal ETD fragmentation for each cross-linked
peptide (Figure 3 and Figures S3-2, S4, and
S5-2 in the Supporting Information). While
different than those from CID, the fragmentation patterns from ETD
also support our proposed cross-linking site and chemistry. For instance,
the c5 and c*8 ions in Figure 3 narrow the
site within the HTC motif; the c4 ion in Figure S3-2 in the Supporting Information, c5 and c6 ions in Figure
S4 in the Supporting Information, and c3
and z8 ions in Figure S5-2 in the Supporting Information pinpointed the cross-link at His220.

the precursor ion m/z 1339.70 (z = 5) of the cross-linked tryptic
peptide S215–K244/S215–K244.

Mechanism of Formation for His-His Cross-Link
Photo-oxidation
and cross-linking between histidine residues have been studied using
both free histidine and model peptides. The commonly accepted mechanism
is depicted in Scheme 1. Singlet oxygen (e.g.,
generated from photoactivated dye rose bengal51) reacts with histidine to form a highly reactive and labile endoperoxide
intermediate, which converts into a hydroperoxide intermediate and
then 2-oxo-histidine (2-oxo-His) and His + 32 intermediates. Subsequently,
the His + 32 intermediate can be attacked by the nucleophilic imidazole
of another histidine residue, followed by the elimination of a water
molecule to give the final cross-linking product (Scheme 1).16,27−29,52,53 As discussed below,
our results are consistent with this mechanism.

First, oxygen
was present in all buffers and water in which IgG1 was exposed to
light irradiation. Second, several photo-oxidation intermediates were
observed. The endoperoxide intermediate is unstable and has only been
observed by low-temperature NMR study,16,27 so we are
not surprised that it was not detected by our LC–MS analysis.
However, the subsequent oxidation intermediates, 2-oxo-His (+14 Da)
and His+32 species (+ 32 Da), were detected. The peptides with masses
14 and 32 Da greater than the unmodified peptide, S215–K244
(SCDKTHTCPPCPAPELLGGPSVFLFPPKPK), were observed
in the light stressed samples but not in the control sample (Table
S3 in the Supporting Information). Tandem
mass spectra confirmed their structures to be the peptides modified
at His220 (Figures S7-2 and S7-3 in the Supporting
Information). Third, the reported model studies showed the
cross-linking was favored at higher pH, as the neutral (deprotonated)
imidazole in histidine (pKa ∼ 6)
is more reactive for nucleophilic attack and thus results in a higher
yield of cross-linking.54 Similar pH dependence
was observed in our case as discussed above (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Lastly, the two His220
residues are juxtaposed in the hinge region, which is highly exposed
to solvent and flexible, as illustrated in Figure S8 in the Supporting Information. In fact, in most crystal
structures, the side chains of residues in the hinge region could
not be located, indicating a high degree of flexibility. In this illustrative
structure (PDB 1HZH), the side chain of only one histidine residue was observed.

On the basis of the reaction pathway and protein structure, cross-linking
of lysine with the oxidized histidine via nucleophilic addition is
also plausible,16,27 and Lys218 is in the vicinity
of His220. Therefore, great effort was made to determine whether the
cross-linking is His220-His220 or Lys218-His220. This is particularly
challenging due to the pseudosymmetry in the cross-linked peptide;
in other words, when the two chains share identical sequence (e.g.,
in Figures 1 and 2),
any fragment ion could come from either one chain or both. For example,
c4 and c5 ions in Figure 3 indicated the existence
of unmodified Lys218 and Thr219 but could not unambiguously establish
whether they were from one chain or both. To address this issue, an
asymmetric cross-linked peptide (i.e., two chains of different length)
was generated via limited digestion. IgG1 fully digested by trypsin
and GluC was treated with Asp-N for a limited time to obtain a cross-linked
peptide with two different chains D217–E229/S215–E229
(Figure 4 and Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). Its precursor ion m/z 1096.09 (z = 3) has
an observed mass of 3283.234 Da, which is in agreement with the theoretical
mass of 3283.240 Da (Table 1). As shown in
Figure 4 and Figure S6 in the Supporting Information, cleavage of the His-His bond resulted
in ions m/z 1511 and m/z 1773, indicating that the oxidized His residue
is on the long chain highlighted in red. Moreover, the c2 and c3 ions
from the short chain (highlighted in blue) together with the c2 to
c5 ions from the long chain (highlighted in red) indicate the absence
of modification for all residues N-terminal to His220 on both chains,
thus ruling out cross-linking between Lys218 and His220. This is not
unexpected, as at the pH for our studies, the amine on the lysine
side chain is mostly protonated and thus renders it unreactive.55,56 Also, of course, others factors such as local environment and solvation
are known to modulate reactivities in enzymes and antibodies.57−59 Taken together, our data have firmly established that the cross-linking
is between the two heavy chain His220 residues.

Other Cross-Links
As reported in the literature,9−11 cross-linking via thioether between the heavy chain hinge region
and the light chain C-termini (HC:S215–K218/LC:T211–S218,
SCDK/TVAPTECS) was also observed in the
photoirradiated IgG1 (Table S3 in the Supporting
Information). The cleavage and formation of carbon–sulfur
(C–S) bonds may occur via either homolytic (e.g., radical or
photoinduced) or heterolytic (e.g, elimination and addition) mechanisms.10,11,60,61 These additional cross-links may also account for the multiple nonreducible
higher molecular species detected by SDS-PAGE and SEC described above
(Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). In the SDS-PAGE gel (Figure S1 in the Supporting
Information), the first band (with an apparent molecular weight
about 92 kDa) for the sample pH9–3xLight (lane 10) was not
observed in the samples pH4.8–3xLight (lane 8) and pH7–3xLight
(lane 9). It is likely that this band corresponds to the thioether
cross-link of LC-HC, as it is favorable under basic conditions.9,10 Although the thioether cross-link between two heavy chains (e.g.,
Cys222-Cys222) has been reported after a higher dose of photo irradiation,11 it was not detected in our sample by MS. The
His-His cross-link of two heavy chains may contribute to the band
with an apparent molecular weight about 100 kDa. The bands with apparent
molecular weight about150 and 200 kDa are probably due to the cross-linking
of more than two chains.

Conclusions
Our XChem-Finder workflow
again leads to the discovery of an undefined
and novel protein His-His cross-link, demonstrating its broad applicability
and utility. Since the His-His cross-link is found in the highly conserved
hinge region of IgG1, this modification most likely exists in other
IgG1 molecules. As discussed above, a low level of cross-linking was
present even without light stress, suggesting protein cross-linking
in therapeutic proteins is perhaps more common than we have appreciated.
Such drastic modification of proteins is likely to affect product
quality, clinical efficacy, and even at low abundance, immunogenicity.
Also again, to the best of our knowledge, there is no other alternative
systematic approach that can be generally used to fully characterize
protein cross-linking without a priori knowledge
of the chemistry and site. With the rapid advancement in mass spectrometric
techniques (e.g., high resolution and complementary fragmentation
mechanisms), we expect the discovery and elucidation of other new
protein cross-linking by our XChem-Finder approach will be equally
successful.
