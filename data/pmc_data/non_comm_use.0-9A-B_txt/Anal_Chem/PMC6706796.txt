High-throughput
screening platforms for the identification of bioactive
compounds in mixtures have become important tools in the drug discovery
process. Miniaturization of such screening systems may overcome problems
associated with small sample volumes and enhance throughput and sensitivity.
Here we present a new screening platform, coined picofractionation
analytics, which encompasses microarray bioassays and mass spectrometry
(MS) of components from minute amounts of samples after their nano
liquid chromatographic (nanoLC) separation. Herein, nanoLC was coupled
to a low-volume liquid dispenser equipped with pressure-fed solenoid
valves, enabling 50-nL volumes of column effluent (300 nL/min) to
be discretely deposited on a glass slide. The resulting fractions
were dried and subsequently bioassayed by sequential printing of nL-volumes
of reagents on top of the spots. Unwanted evaporation of bioassay
liquids was circumvented by employing mineral oil droplets. A fluorescence
microscope was used for assay readout in kinetic mode. Bioassay data
were correlated to MS data obtained using the same nanoLC conditions
in order to assign bioactives. The platform provides the possibility
of freely choosing a wide diversity of bioassay formats, including
those requiring long incubation times. The new method was compared
to a standard bioassay approach, and its applicability was demonstrated
by screening plasmin inhibitors and fibrinolytic bioactives from mixtures
of standards and snake venoms, revealing active peptides and coagulopathic
proteases.

==== Body
Current approaches
used for
analyzing complex mixtures for bioactivity properties involve the
use of screening platforms that commonly combine several analytical
techniques.1−3 The so-called nanofractionation approach encompasses
liquid chromatographic (LC) separation, using conventional-bore columns,
online coupled to UV absorbance and mass spectrometric (MS) detection,
as well as to a bioassay via continuous collection of microliter fractions
of the column effluent.1 Fractions of 3-
to 10-s are collected on microtiter well plates and subsequently centrifuge
freeze-dried and exposed to a bioassay of choice. The overall bioassay
readout is then constructed into a bioactivity chromatogram and correlated
to the parallel obtained UV-absorbance and MS data with the objective
to identify (unknown) bioactive compounds. This technology has been
applied successfully to a wide range of complex mixtures, including
snake venoms,4−6 plant extracts,7 environmental
samples,8,9 and metabolic mixtures of new chemical entities
(NCEs).10

Natural samples such as
animal venoms or biofluids from small animals
may be precious sources of new drugs. However, these samples are often
only available in very small amounts and are therefore typically not
suitable for most established screening platforms. Microfluidic high-resolution
screening (HRS) platforms1 employing online
homogeneous bioassays have shown potential to tackle this problem.11,12 However, these systems allow only short incubation times and require
relatively high concentrations of a soluble target protein (e.g.,
receptor or enzyme) to attain satisfactory performance. An alternative
to online microfluidic bioassaying could be the coupling of microarray
bioassays, which can accommodate hundreds to thousands of minute-volume
bioassay reactions, to nano liquid chromatography (nanoLC), which
employs nL/min range flow rates and small sample injection volumes
(nL to low μL). Small molecular microarrays (SMMs) have been
successfully implemented in drug discovery processes,13−15 such as for drug–drug interaction screening of cytochrome
P450 enzymes16−18 and drug cytotoxicity evaluation,19,20 but have also found application in the identification of pesticides
in food21 and environmental samples22 and of bioweapon toxins.23 However, these microarray platforms are only suited for
screening pure compound libraries or single-analyte samples, limiting
their usefulness to analyze complex mixtures of bioactive compounds,
such as venoms and natural extracts, as they would require preseparation.

Off-line chemical analysis of mixtures of components after nanoLC24 has been achieved via fractionation of nanoLC
effluent using various deposition approaches.25−29 Pereira et al.28 and Küster
et al.26,27 used a microfluidics T-junction for contact
deposition generating droplets by shear force using perfluorodecalin
and subsequent spotting onto plates for MALDI-MS. Küster et
al.26 managed to deposit liquid droplets
of ∼2.5 nL. Noncontact deposition of low-nL volume droplets
requires application of some sort of force to dislodge droplets from
a dispensing tip. Young and Li29 applied
a pulsed voltage to a solenoid coil to deposit effluent droplets from
a connected fused-silica capillary onto MALDI-plates in a noncontact
fashion. This method was shown to be optimal for droplet sizes above
100 nL, but by decreasing the distance between the surface of the
collecting plate and the capillary tip, spot volumes down to 20 nL
could be achieved.

In the present study, we introduce a new
fractionation platform
for profiling bioactive components in small volumes of complex mixtures
after separation by nanoLC. This “picofractionation”
system analyzes nL to low-μL sample volumes and deposits 10-s
fractions (50 nL each) of nanoLC effluent onto a coated glass slide.
Our study for the first time demonstrates proof of concept analytics
enabling nanoLC separations with nanoliter regime fraction collection
followed by integrated postcolumn bioassaying. For this purpose, a
nanoliter-volume liquid dispenser was used, providing contactless
droplet array printing of the column effluent. The bioactivity of
the fractionated samples was assessed by applying a fluorescence-based
bioassay using a spot-on-spot approach. Microarray bioassay readout
was performed kinetically using a modified fluorescence microscope.
The resulting data were converted to microarray bioactivity chromatograms
(MBCs), in which each point represents a slope of each bioassay reaction
present on a glass slide. The MBCs were correlated with nanoLC-UV
and -MS data for (structural) assignment of bioactive compounds. We
evaluated the described picofractionation platform by employing a
plasmin bioassay for the profiling of four snake venoms in order to
detect the presence of plasmin inhibitors (antifibrinolytic agents)
and proteases with fibrinolytic-like activities. The term “picofractionation”
was chosen to continue the already existing nomenclature for fractionation
platforms. Starting with microfractionation systems, the collected
fractions often were found to be in the milliliter range.30−33 We found that this naming system was used already in publications
dated as early as 1951.30 Successively,
platforms working in the microliter range were called nanofractionation.34−36 Therefore, in this study we called the presented nanoliter range
fractionation platform picofractionation.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
and Snake Venoms
All chemicals used were
purchased commercially, and the details can be found in Supporting Information (SI) section S1.

Lyophilized snake venom samples from Bothrops asper (Costa Rica), Deinagkistrodon acutus (captive bred
of Chinese origin), Trimeresurus trigonocephalus (Sri
Lanka), and Trimeresurus purpureomaculatus (Thailand)
were sourced from historical venom samples stored in the Centre for
Snakebite Research & Interventions at the Liverpool School of
Tropical Medicine. For analysis, the venoms were diluted in Milli-Q
water from a stock solution (5 mg/mL in water) to a concentration
of 1 mg/mL. The venom samples were stored at −80 °C until
use.

Preparation of Glass Slides and Coating
To ensure a
hydrophobic surface, standard microscope glass slides (76 × 26
mm) with ground edges from Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, United
Kingdom) were coated with 4 mL of a mixture comprising 16 mL of methyltrimethoxysilane
(MTMOS), 6.4 mL of 5 mM HCl, and 16 mL of 25 mM potassium phosphate
buffer at pH 8 according to the protocol of Lee et al.37 The slides were coated at least 4 days prior
to nanoLC spotting. Detailed information on the coating procedure
can be found in SI section S2.

NanoLC
NanoLC was performed with a Dionex Ultimate
3000 nanoLC system from Thermo Scientific equipped with an autosampler,
two binary high pressure gradient pumps, one loading pump, and a variable
wavelength UV absorbance detector set to 214 nm. Samples (1 μL
unless otherwise stated) were first loaded onto a trapping column
(0.3 mm ID; 5 mm length; packed with Acclaim PepMap 100 C18 from Thermo
Fisher; 5 μm pore size) for 6 min using a loading pump delivering
acetonitrile–water (2:98; v/v) with 0.1% TFA at a flow rate
of 10 μL/min. After 6 min the trapping column was switched in
line with the analytical column (C18; 75 μm ID; 150 mm length;
2 μm pore size) through a 6-port switch valve. All analyses
were performed using a gradient elution with a mobile phase comprised
of solvent A (water–acetonitrile–formic acid (98:2:0.1;
v/v/v)) and solvent B (acetonitrile–water–formic acid
(98:2:0.1; v/v/v). Further information on the nanoLC gradients can
be found in SI section S3.

For sample
analysis with MS detection, the nanoLC was coupled to a Bruker TIMS-TOF
instrument (Bremen, Germany) using a CaptiveSpray source and a nanoBooster
(Bruker Daltonics) employing acetonitrile. The MS source settings
were as follows: capillary voltage, 1200 V; nanoBooster gas pressure,
0.25 bar; temperature, 150 °C. The range of m/z 50–3000 was covered. For nanoLC-MS analysis
the injection volumes for D. acutus, T. trigonocephalus, and T. purpureomaculatus were 100 nL and for B. asper 500 nL. The chromatographic methods (i.e., gradients)
used to separate the standard solution (a mixture of leupeptin diastereoisomers)
and the dissolved snake venoms were the same as used for the postcolumn
microarray bioassaying analyses.

Fractionation of nanoLC
Effluent
Collection of nanoliter
fractions of nanoLC effluent was facilitated by the nanovolume liquid
dispenser Preddator from Red&Whyte Limited (London, UK) equipped
with four (1–4) pressure fed solenoid valves (The presentation
of valves 1–4 can be found in Figure S2). The nanoLC effluent was led to the Preddator by a ∼30 cm
long fused-silica capillary (75 μm I.D. and 365 μm O.D.)
which was connected to the 280-μm O.D. capillary exiting the
UV absorbance detector using a Teflon sleeve connector (Thermo Scientific).
The other end of the fused-silica capillary was inserted into a fluorinated
ethylene propylene (FEP) tubing sleeve (length 5.8 cm; O.D. 1/16 in.;
I.D. 0.0155 in.) which was mounted in a custom-made holder placed
to the left side of the dispensing arm of the Preddator that moves
in XY directions (Figure 1A). A schematic view of the platform is shown in Figure 1. The tip of the
capillary inserted into the FEP tubing sleeve was protruding ∼5
mm outside the tubing sleeve and was placed centrally below the opening
of the most left positioned solenoid valve (1) in the arm of the Preddator
(Figure 1B).

method are outlined: (1) a complex mixture is injected; (2) mixture

Figure S3 presents a zoomed image
of
the interface between nanoLC and the nanovolume liquid dispenser.
Collection of nanoliter effluent fractions was possible by using solenoid
valve 1 to dispense water droplets of 100 nL that hit and merge “in
flight” with the effluent droplets exiting the tip of the connecting
capillary, providing contact-free deposition of LC effluent fractions
onto the receiving glass slide (Figure 1D–E). Correct positioning of the capillary tip
was essential in order to achieve repeatable and microarray-bioassay-compatible
collection of the nanoLC effluent. To prevent “climbing”
of the droplet along the outside of the capillary by adhesion forces,
its tip was silylated with MTMOS coating solution (more detailed information
on the capillary preparation can be found in SI, section S4). This treatment renders the tip more hydrophobic and
lasted for ∼3–4 weeks. The picofractionation process
was managed by the in-house developed software Ariadne v. 1.10, enabling
spotting of effluent fractions ranging from 0.1 to 900 s. In this
study, a fraction was spotted every 10 s.

Microarray Plasmin-Activity
Assay with Fluorescence Readout
The deposited nanoliter fractions
were exposed to a plasmin bioassay
that was adapted from a previously developed 384 microtiter well-plate
format as described by Zietek et al.38 Collected
effluent fractions dried within ∼5 min at ambient atmosphere
and were then covered with a 100-nL drop of water dispensed by solenoid
valve 3 of the Preddator (spot-on-spot; Figure 1, Figure S2) at
an overpressure of 200 mbar (i.e., atmospheric pressure +200 mbar).
Next, 100 nL of a 200 ng/mL plasmin solution dissolved in 0.1 M Tris-HCl
buffer enriched with 0.1% BSA (w/v) was spotted onto the water droplets
on the glass slides using solenoid nozzle 2 at an overpressure of
200 mbar. Then, two droplets of mineral oil (200 nL each) were dispensed
0.2 mm left and right, respectively, of each spotted droplet of plasmin
solution, in order to prevent disintegration of the enzyme solution
droplet. The mineral oil was used to prevent evaporation of the bioassay
liquids and was dispensed using solenoid valve 4 at an overpressure
of 1650 mbar. Several other spotting sequences were tested prior to
reaching the here described optimal procedure (see Figure S4). After depositing the mineral oil, the spots were
incubated for 30 min at RT under a polystyrene black cover, without
touching the surface of the glass slide. Finally, the bioassay was
initiated by dispensing 100 nL of the fluorogenic substrate H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-AMC (10 μM) onto the incubation droplets,
with solenoid valve 2 at an overpressure of 200 mbar. The prepared
microarray glass slide was then directly placed in a glass slide holder
of a Märzhäuser Wetzlar XY stage (type SCAN IM 130 ×
100; Wetzlar, Germany) mounted on top of a Lumascope 620 (Etaluma,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) inverted fluorescence microscope for fluorescence
readout and image acquisition (Figure S5). For detection of the product of the enzymatic reaction (7-amino-4-methylcoumarin
(AMC)) an excitation filter of 370–410 nm was used. In the
Lumascope 620, fluorescence emission light was detected by a digital
camera containing a high sensitivity monochrome complementary metal
oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor. An apochromatic microscope
objective with 4× magnification (numerical aperture (NA), 0.13;
working distance (WD), 17.2 mm, type number MA1012) from Meiji Techno
(San Jose, California, USA) was used for the measurements. To automate
image acquisition of all microarray bioassay spots at fixed time intervals
(i.e., kinetic measurements), the XY stage and the fluorescence microscope
were controlled with the μManager (version 1.4) open source
software39 that allowed synchronization
of the hardware. Information on the image acquisition and processing
of the microarray data can be found in SI, section S5.

Performance and Quality of the Plasmin Microarray
Bioassay
The performance of the microarray bioassay was first
evaluated
by determining IC50 values of the plasmin inhibitors leupeptin and
aprotinin. Details on this procedure can be found in SI S6. The Z′-factor, a standardized statistical tool
described by Zhang et al.40 was used to
determine the assay quality (see SI S7).

Results and Discussion
We present the development and validation
of a so-called picofractionation
screening platform which combines nanoLC of bioactive samples with
microarray bioassaying employing a fluorescence microscope via contactless
fractionation of the nL/min column effluent. Parallel nanoLC-MS analyses
of the same samples were performed for correlating bioactivity of
components to their accurate mass.

Fractionation of nanoLC Effluent
To achieve noncontact
deposition of 50-nL fractions of nanoLC effluent, a fused-silica capillary
connected to the nanoLC column was positioned at an angle of 45°
just underneath a solenoid valve of a dispensing arm of a high-accuracy
low-volume dispenser (Figure S3). We chose
a noncontact deposition because it offers a number of advantages over
contact deposition, and these include a better repeatability and reproducibility
of the deposited droplets, less chance of droplet contamination and
memory effects, and no damage to the surface of the glass slide and/or
nanoLC capillary (such as scratching the surface or crushing of the
capillary). The latter is important in the case of fluorescence readouts
as any damage to the surface of the glass slide would cause artifacts
contributing to light scattering and increases in overall background
signal which will affect the quality of the measurement. Finally,
the noncontact spotting mode omits the use of a Z-stage in the spotting
movement procedure and the hardware, which renders the system less
technically complicated. In addition, X,Y stage spotting intrinsically
is much faster since the Z-movement for every droplet deposition is
not needed. Positioning, and the angle of the capillary with respect
to the nozzle of the solenoid valve, along with the shape of the capillary
tip, were important parameters to ensure reproducible and accurate
deposition of effluent droplets on to the microarray glass slide.
A capillary with a blunt end and a hydrophobic tip (silylated with
MTMOS), prevented “climbing” of liquid along the outside
of the capillary and yielded optimal detaching of nanoLC effluent
by the ejected water droplets. The distance between the nanoLC effluent
capillary and the spotter nozzle was kept small (∼2 mm), as
was the distance between the capillary tip and the glass slide surface
(∼2 mm). These parameters provided precise and consistent droplet
deposition on the glass slide for mobile phases containing up to 67%
solvent B. Above this percentage of solvent B, the position of the
capillary had to be adjusted ∼0.5 mm further away from the
spotter nozzle (decreasing the distance between the tip of the capillary
and the glass slide to less than 1.5 mm) in order to ensure appropriate
droplet deposition. As future technical advancement of the methodology,
automatic adjustment of the needle will be incorporated into the system.

Microarray Bioassay Format
The bioactivity of individual
compounds separated by nanoLC and deposited on the glass slide has
to be measured with a bioassay suitable for microarray formats. Bioassaying
in small volumes raises issues associated with unwanted evaporation
of bioassay solvents and with redissolving of the dried fractions.
To prevent water evaporation during the microarray assay incubation,
we adapted the droplet-in-oil approach of Sun et al.41 In their approach, mineral oil was spotted first on a glass
slide to generate droplet arrays into which analytes and the bioassay
components were ejected for generation of bioassay-in-oil-droplets.
However, in our case, after column effluent droplet spotting, the
LC solvent evaporates leaving dry spots. Therefore, prior to spotting
of the enzyme solution, a 100-nL droplet of water was dispensed on
top of the dried fraction, in order to redissolve deposited components
and thus to facilitate their mixing with the enzyme. The water droplet
was partially evaporated (approximately 70% by visual assessment)
prior to spotting of the enzyme solution to avoid additional dilution
of the bioassay components. Then, mineral oil was spotted to the plasmin
solution, followed by 30 min incubation at room temperature under
a polystyrene cover. However, spot-on-spot printing of the oil resulted
in disintegration of the previously spotted droplets of the plasmin
solution. Therefore, different approaches of spotting mineral oil
onto the bioassay reaction mix were evaluated (see Figure S4 for details). We found that spotting two oil droplets
0.2 mm adjacent (left and right) to an enzyme droplet maintained the
enzyme droplet’s integrity, while the two oil droplets merged
into one, covering the enzyme droplet. The bioassay reaction was subsequently
initiated by spotting 100 nL of substrate solution through the oil
cover into the enzyme and sample component-containing inner droplet.
The mineral oil droplets were not removed from the reaction droplets.
They were kept throughout the bioassay reactions as dome shaped cover
shells to prevent the bioassay mixtures from evaporating. Considering
the highly nonpolar nature of mineral oil, partitioning of the compounds
relevant to this research (i.e., peptides, protein and relatively
polar small molecules) is not an issue.

Even when taking an
enzyme solution that was prepared freshly from a stock kept at −20
°C, a decrease of enzymatic activity over time was observed when
the solution was dispensed (data not shown). This activity loss appeared
to be due to exposure to ambient temperature solution and evaporation
of the enzyme solution. Therefore, the enzyme solution was kept on
ice as long as possible prior to dispensing and then dispensed quickly
followed by coverage with mineral oil. This was achieved by dispensing
not more than 100 droplets with one portion of cold enzyme solution.
For the next 100 droplets, a new cold portion was used. Fast dispensing
of the enzyme and the oil was achieved by time-optimizing the point-to-point
movement of the liquid dispenser using the control software.

The biochemical conditions and reagent concentrations of the plasmin
inhibition assay used in an earlier developed plate reader format38 were transferred to and evaluated with the microarray
bioassay format. The microarray assay quality and dynamic range were
assessed by determining the Z′-factor, which was 0.71, indicating
an excellent bioassay according to Zhang et al.40 (Figure 2). Comparable results were obtained for the 384-well plate format,
where the Z′-factor for the same bioassay was determined to
be 0.74.38 The good agreement in the Z′-factors
shows the straightforward transfer of a bioassay initially developed
for the 384-well plate format (operating at 50 μL well volume)
to the microarray format that requires only 200 nL of the bioassay
mixture (i.e., 250 times lower volume). Although when considering
the biological aspects only the two methods are expected to provide
similar results, the difference lies in the technical difficulties.
Performing a bioassay in for example 50 μL volume in wells of
a well plate with readout using a standardized platereader is routine
laboratory work. In contrast, the technical difficulties of preparing
and measuring bioassays in 200 nL volumes are extremely high. Besides,
all preparation steps (i.e., spotting), measuring procedures (i.e.,
the in-house developed confocal microscope bioassay spot reader),
and data processing with automated spot recognition and integrated
kinetic bioassay development monitoring per spot are complex and far
from trivial.

Figure 2 Bioassay evaluation with Z′-factor. Positive control
(leupeptin
at 200 μM; n = 100) and negative control (mobile
phase A; n = 100). SD: standard deviation.

In order to evaluate whether the
microarray bioassay can accurately
determine inhibitory properties of bioactives, IC50 values of two
potent plasmin inhibitors, leupeptin and aprotinin, were determined
and compared with IC50 values obtained using the standard 384-well
plate reader bioassay.38 Determination
of IC50 values was performed with the microarray bioassay on dried
inhibitor spots that were spotted on a MTMOS coated glass slide. Leupeptin
and aprotinin were dispensed at ten different concentrations ranging
from 0 to 400 μM and from 0 to 30 μM, respectively. Figure S6 shows the IC50 curve of leupeptin obtained
with the microarray bioassay. The IC50 for leupeptin was found to
be 4.7 μM (SD, 2.7 μM), which was approximately two times
lower than the IC50 obtained using the 384-well plate reader format
(8.9 μM; SD, 3.1 μM). For aprotinin an IC50 value of 51
nM (SD, 27 nM) was determined with the microarray bioassay, whereas
the IC50 value was 35 nM (SD, 14) with the plate reader assay (Figure S6). Choo et al.42 reported an IC50 of 21.7 nM for aprotinin against plasmin. Hence,
although we used different conditions for our plasmin bioassay—we
used a different enzyme concentration and a fluorogenic instead of
a chromogenic substrate as in the case of Choo et al.—the inhibitory
potency of aprotinin toward plasmin found in our study agreed well
with the value of Choo et al.

NanoLC-Microarray Bioassaying
of Plasmin Inhibitors
In order to evaluate the performance
of the picofractionation platform,
in terms of repeatability and sensitivity, various concentrations
of a mixture of leupeptin and aprotinin were analyzed by nanoLC and
the column effluent was fractionated on MTMOS-coated glass slides. Figure 3 shows representative
resulting microarray bioactivity chromatograms (MBCs) of leupeptin
injected at concentrations ranging from 10 to 200 μM. The highest
concentration injected induced full inhibition of plasmin, which is
depicted in Figure 3 as a negative peak in the upper superimposed chromatogram. A gradually
lower percentage of full inhibition was observed upon injection of
lower leupeptin concentrations, as reflected by decreasing heights
of the negative peaks. A concentration of 10 μM appeared to
be the bioassay detection limit. Although comparable, in our previous
study in which a nanofractionation system was used, the detection
limit for leupeptin was 6.3 μM.38 It has to be noted that miniaturized bioassays do not lead to increased
sensitivity as in the case of nanoLC-MS analysis of especially peptide
mixtures (for proteomics analyses for example). Bioassay sensitivity
depends on the bioassay and the detection system used for readout.
Considering that in our current study a prototype custom-built new
analytical device was used, a slightly lower fluorescence signal and
thus sensitivity can be expected. The bioactivity peaks for leupeptin
were relatively narrow, and no extensive dose-dependent peak broadening
was observed. However, for aprotinin, a high-affinity plasmin inhibitor,
extensive peak broadening was already observed at 30 μM, due
to the sigmoidal dose–response relationship typical for bioactivity
detection.10,43 Peak broadening in postcolumn
bioassaying, such as high resolution screening43,44 and nanofractionation analytics,4,6,7,34 seems exaggerated compared
to parallel UV or MS signals since bioassay responses are sigmoidal
concentration–response in nature in contrary to chemical detector
responses. Peak broadening is expected to be better visible after
nanoLC separations than after normal bore LC separations because the
column dimensions of the nanoLC result faster in column overloading
and sample preconcentration at the start of the gradient resulting
in higher concentrations of compounds when eluting.

Figure 3 Superimposed microarray
bioactivity chromatograms (MBCs) resulting
from microarray bioassays of fractionated leupeptin (left) and aprotinin
(right) injected at different concentrations to nanoLC. The MBCs are
correlated with nanoLC-UV traces (bottom) obtained from measurement
of leupeptin and aprotinin at 25 μM and 30 μM, respectively.
For these analyses a short chromatographic gradient of 35 min was
used.

The lowest concentration of aprotinin
at which plasmin inhibition
was still observed was an injected concentration of 44 nM. The retention
time of the chromatographic peak and the bioactive peak was stable
for both compounds at each concentration measured, demonstrating robustness
of the method.

An important characteristic of the picofractionation
system is
the capability to maintain the chromatographic resolution obtained
during separation. To test the picofractionation system for this characteristic,
two leupeptin diastereoisomers were analyzed.45 Both diastereoisomers possess potent inhibitory activities toward
plasmin and can be separated by RPLC. Previous analyses, however,
were performed using a relatively fast gradient, which did not result
in diastereoisomers separation (Figure 3). By applying a more shallow (60 min) gradient, the
leupeptin diastereoisomers were separated with baseline resolution,
allowing fractionation and microarray bioactivity testing of the individual
diastereoisomers (Figure 4). When comparing picofractionation bioassay chromatograms
with those given in the nanofractionation study of Zietek et al.,38 the picofractionation results do not give a
better resolution. Improvement in separation resolution of venom proteins,
however, was not the goal of the current study. Instead, the main
goal of this study was to build and demonstrate an analytical methodology
capable of postcolumn bioassaying complex bioactive mixtures using
nanoliter range sample volumes. This offers the possibility to work
with samples only available in low volumes such as snake venoms and
insect venoms. As Figure 4 shows that the diastereoisomers of leupeptin can be separated
and bioassayed without loss in separation efficiency from the nanoLC,
higher resolutions in the system have to be achieved in the separation
component of the system and not the picofractionation aspect. Improving
the resolution of venom protein separations, however, is not the focus
of this study.

chromatogram (MBC) was correlated with the UV absorbance trace (middle)
and MS chromatogram (bottom). For MS analysis, leupeptin at a concentration
of 2 μM was used. BPC: base peak chromatogram. For this analysis
a long chromatographic gradient of 60 min was used.

NanoLC-Microarray Bioassay Analysis of Snake
Venoms
Venoms are complex mixtures containing multiple bioactive
compounds
with high potency and/or selectivity for a range of biological targets.
Hence, bioactives derived from venoms are considered valuable entry
points for drug discovery. Although attractive for these reasons,
studying venoms can be challenging due to their complexity and, often,
minute quantities of available material.46 To evaluate the usefulness of the nanoLC platform when coupled to
both postcolumn microarray bioassaying and MS detection, we analyzed
four venoms originating from the pit vipers Bothrops asper, Deinagkistrodon acutus, Trimeresurus trigonocephalus, and Trimeresurus purpureomaculatus, respectively. Figures 5 and S7 show MBCs of the four venoms correlated to
UV chromatograms and separately obtained nanoLC-MS data. In the MBC
of B. asper, also known as fer-de-lance (Figure 5), a broad positive
signal between 28 and 33 min was observed, which suggests that the
venom contains peptides and/or proteins with fibrinolytic activity. B. asper venom is known to contain a number of proteolytic
enzymes, including class PI, PII, and PIII snake venom metalloproteinases
(SVMPs), which are at least in part responsible for the devastating
toxic effects in cases of snakebite envenoming.47 For further information on SVMP classification the reader
is referred to a review on SVMPs by Takeda et al.48 Other reported literature on metalloproteinases isolated
from B. asper describes hemorrhagic activity of SVMPs
including the PI SVMP BaP1 (22.7 kDa)49 and PIII SVMP BaH4 (69 kDa).50 Considering
the width of the positive MBC peak observed, most probably the observed
bioactivity is due to multiple, partly coeluting, bioactive compounds
present in the venom. Similar broad bioactive peaks were also observed
during analyses of snake venom samples using the normal-bore chromatography
based nanofractionation system.4 This implies
that the picofractionation approach provides comparable separation
efficiency. Upon correlating the MBC with the obtained MS data, the m/z values of a number of component ions
were observed in the time frame of the positive MCB peak (Table S1). In Figure 5, the total ion chromatogram (TIC) and extracted
ion chromatograms (XICs) of the relevant m/z values are plotted. Although a number of compounds with
masses in the range of 20–30 kDa were observed, and which could
be SVMPs or SVSPs (especially those eluting between 31 and 32 min),
due to the coelution of these compounds it was not possible to determine
which ion(s) were responsible for the bioactivity. Due to the very
complex composition and high diversity of toxins in most venoms, a
single separation usually does not suffice in obtaining baseline separation
of the venom toxins. We have identified this limitation also in our
previous studies in which the nanofractionation platform of high-resolution
screening analytics was used. In order to address this limitation,
an orthogonal separation using two different separation mechanisms
(e.g., RP and HILIC) can be applied and was in fact demonstrated by
us and others.6,7,38 Similar
approaches are anticipated to be applied to the picofractionation
platform, however, at later stages of its development.

Figure 5 Analysis of venoms of B. asper (left) and T. trigonocephalus (right)
using the picofractionation platform
employing profiling of plasmin inhibition and protease activity. B. asper shows a positive peak between retention time 28
and 33 min, indicating the presence of multiple venom proteases and/or
plasmin activators. From the parallel obtained MS data, multiple masses
are found to match the positive peak area of the microarray bioassay
chromatogram (MBC) as shown as extracted-ion chromatograms (XICs).
For T. trigonocephalus, both positive and negative
peaks were observed indicating the presence of proteases and/or plasmin
activators as well as plasmin inhibitors. The XICs indicate multiple
potential bioactive peptides or proteins per peak.

The venom of D. acutus, also known
as “the
hundred pacer”, exhibited similar fibrinolytic-like activities
to those observed for B. asper. When analyzed using
the picofractionation platform, a positive peak in the MBC between
23 and 28 min was visible (Figure S7).
In addition, between 28 and 32 min, a negative peak representing plasmin
inhibition was observed. While previous reports have described fibrinolytic
metalloproteinases, e.g. FIIa (26 kDa) and Dacin (23 kDa)
in the venom of D. acutus,51,52 to our knowledge antifibrinolytic activities have not yet been reported.
The XICs of m/z values detected
for components eluting between 28 and 32 min are shown in Figure S7 and originate from both singly and
multiple charged species potentially representing peptides as well
as SVMPs (∼20–30 kDa).

The other two snake venoms
analyzed in this study were from the
congeneric species T. trigonocephalus and T. purpureomaculatus, known
as the Sri Lanka Pit Viper and the Mangrove Pit Viper, respectively.
The MBCs of these two venoms showed similar profiles, both exhibiting
fibrinolytic-like and antifibrinolytic activities (Figures 5 and S7). Venom from T. purpureomaculatus has been reported
to contain a number of proteolytic enzymes, including for example,
the thrombin-like enzyme (an SVSP) purpurase (35 kDa)53 and a proteolytic SVMP called hemorrhagin (72 kDa).54 Our nanoLC-MS setup was not able to effectively
detect such high molecular masses due to a limited sensitivity for
the higher mass proteases that are present at low concentration. The m/z values that were observed for the bioactivity
peaks are listed in Table S1. The negative
bioactivity peak observed in the MBC of T. purpureomaculatus between 29 and 33 min (Figure S7) represents
antiplasmin (antifibrinolytic) activities. In the case of T. trigonocephalus venom (Figure 5), to our knowledge, the biochemical antiplasmin
profile has not been reported yet, which can be due to the fact that
the venom of this species is considered to be of low medical relevance55 in contrast to, for example, the venom of B. asper. Nevertheless, clinical features of envenomation
by T. trigonocephalus have been reported to include
coagulopathy and local hemorrhage,55 pathologies
consistent with the bioactivities observed here and which are likely
due to the action of proteolytic enzymes.

Conclusions
This
study describes the development and application of a new picofractionation
system which couples nanoLC to microarray bioassaying via noncontact
spotting of nanoliter-range effluent fractions. A number of adaptations,
such as spot-on-spot dispensing, hydrophobic coating of deposition
capillary, and use of spot-adjacent oil droplets, allowed the effective
transfer of a conventional microtiter well-plate-based bioassay to
microarray format. Suitable bioassay performance was indicated by
a good correlation of determined IC50 values for leupeptin and aprotinin
obtained with a conventional bioassay format and with the new miniaturized
method. The new method was evaluated by the analysis of different
concentrations of the plasmin inhibitors leupeptin and aprotinin by
the nanoLC-microarray bioassay system. The ability of the system to
achieve high-resolution fractionation at nanoLC flow rates was shown
by separating and distinctively depositing diastereoisomers of leupeptin
followed by individually assessing their inhibiting activity. Furthermore,
we validated the “real-world” applicability of the picofractionation
system by screening minute amounts of snake venoms from Bothrops
asper, Deinagkistrodon acutus, Trimeresurus trigonocephalus and Trimeresurus purpureomaculatus. The results
indicated the presence of proteases as well as compounds with both
antifibrinolytic and fibrinolytic-like properties. It should be noted,
however, that some venom toxins can (partly) denaturate during LC
separation rendering them inactive and thus not detectable in the
plasmin bioassay. In general, the results obtained were in agreement
with the available literature. The new method described herein will
facilitate bioactivity profiling complex bioactive mixtures and consumes
only very low sample volumes (i.e., in the range of 50 nL to 1 μL).
Anticipated future developments of the picofractionation platform
include further optimization of the chromatographic part of the system
to achieve better separations for venoms, miniaturization of the microarray
dimensions to allow bioassay multiplexing, and implementation of an
effluent split after UV detection that will permit simultaneous parallel
online MS analysis next to microarray spotting and bioassaying. The
method presented in this study is anticipated to be generic in nature
in the sense that other bioassay formats can be implemented in a straightforward
manner. Preliminary data has for example shown that a fluorescence
enhancement ligand binding assay functions in the methodology as well
(data not shown). With minor modifications (such as effluent droplet
ejections with MALDI matrix solution instead of the now used water)
the current methodology is expected to be adaptable for integrated
postcolumn MALDI-MS analysis as well.
