Isotope effect may cause partial
chromatographic separation of
labeled (heavy) and unlabeled (light) isotopologue pairs. Together
with a simultaneous matrix effect, this could lead to unacceptable
accuracy in quantitative liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
assays, especially when electrospray ionization is used. Four biologically
relevant reactive aldehydes (acrolein, malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal,
and 4-oxo-2-nonenal) were derivatized with light or heavy (d3-, 13C6-, 15N2-, or 15N4-labeled) 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine
and used as model compounds to evaluate chromatographic isotope effects.
For comprehensive assessment of retention time differences between
light/heavy pairs under various gradient reversed-phase liquid chromatography
conditions, major chromatographic parameters (stationary phase, mobile
phase pH, temperature, organic solvent, and gradient slope) and different
isotope labelings were addressed by multiple-factor screening using
experimental designs that included both asymmetrical (Addelman) and
Plackett–Burman schemes followed by statistical evaluations.
Results confirmed that the most effective approach to avoid chromatographic
isotope effect is the use of 15N or 13C labeling
instead of deuterium labeling, while chromatographic parameters had
no general influence. Comparison of the alternate isotope-coded derivatization
assay (AIDA) using deuterium versus 15N labeling gave unacceptable
differences (>15%) upon quantifying some of the model aldehydes
from
biological matrixes. On the basis of our results, we recommend the
modification of the AIDA protocol by replacing d3-2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine with 15N- or 13C-labeled derivatizing reagent to avoid possible unfavorable consequences
of chromatographic isotope effects.

==== Body
High-performance
liquid chromatography
coupled with tandem mass spectrometric (LC–MS/MS) detection
is a frequently used technique for the identification and quantification
of a wide range of chemical species in biological matrixes. The superior
specificity of MS allows the simplification of sample
preparation, and the application of fast gradient methods, where a
baseline separation of all components is not required. However, coeluting
matrix components can significantly affect the accuracy and precision
of a method.1−4 The use of a stable-isotope-labeled internal standard (IS), presumed
to have identical physicochemical properties to those of the corresponding
unlabeled analyte, is considered to correct for the variability arising
from sample preparations and instrumental analyses. Generally, deuterium
(d-) labeled ISs are available commercially; however,
they may elute at different time points than their analytes due to
chromatographic isotope effect.5−7 The shifts in the retention times
can be large enough to cause differential matrix effect in LC–MS,
especially when electrospray ionization (ESI) is used.2 Therefore, the change in the analyte
to IS peak area ratios may be significant enough to influence the
accuracy of quantitation.8−13

Several approaches have been recommended to overcome caveats
associated
with the use of d-labeled ISs.12−17 Additional sample preparation steps, the use of shallow gradient
profiles to achieve adequate separation of analytes from major matrix
components eluting with the solvent front, application of atmospheric
pressure chemical ionization (APCI) which is less prone to matrix
effect than ESI,2 or using other than d- (i.e., 13C-, 15N-, or 18O-) labeled ISs are examples of these efforts. Unfortunately,
all of these practices have limitations; for instance, multiple sample
preparation steps and longer chromatography using shallow gradients
decrease sample throughput without actually eliminating problems related
to matrix effect.4 In
many cases, the APCI technique results in sensitivity loss compared
to ESI.18,19 It has also been reported that data obtained
through the use of the “minimal labeling approach” require
corrections by an isotope pattern deconvolution algorithm.16,17 On the other hand, the limited availability and/or high price of
other than d-labeled analogues may be a practical
hurdle that prevents their widespread applications.

Despite
earlier reports,5−9,13,20 the influence of operating parameters (e.g., stationary phase, mobile
phase pH, temperature, organic solvent, and gradient slope) relevant
to most gradient LC–MS-based bioassays on chromatographic isotope
effects has not been assessed and understood. Non-deuterium-labeled
species also have not been studied extensively in this context, especially
when the most widely applied analytical gradient reversed-phase HPLC
(RPLC) conditions are considered.21 Therefore,
we evaluated the chromatographic isotope effect brought about by stable
isotope labeling on different atoms in the framework of isotope-coded
derivatization (ICD) that represents an emerging method for quantitative
metabolite profiling.22,23 We focused on its implementation
known as alternate isotope-coded derivatization assay (AIDA) and applied
it to the LC–MS/MS analysis of biologically relevant aldehydes.24 AIDA uses 2,4-dinitro-3,5,6-trideuterophenylhydrazine
(d3-DNPH) for isotope-coded “heavy”
labeling, and has been validated for malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal
(HNE) quantifications. Here we also included 15N- and 13C-labeled DNPH reagents, and extended our study to acrolein
(ACR) and 4-oxo-2-nonenal (ONE), as additional lipid peroxidation
(LPO) end-products (Figure 1).

selected reactive aldehydes and their DNPH
derivatives.

Overall, we aspired to
a comprehensive assessment of the subject
through experimental screening designs25,26 for the first
time to address the contributions of operating parameters relevant
to most gradient LC–MS-based bioassays and stable isotope labeling
to the chromatographic isotope effect that could compromise the accuracy
and precision of quantitation by RPLC–ESI-MS. These multivariate
approaches allow for predicting the effect of a given factor at several
levels of combinations with other factors.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
and Reagents
Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT),
ACR, DNPH, MDA-tetrabutylammonium salt, [15N]KNO3 (98% isotope purity), [15N2]hydrazine sulfate
(98% isotope purity), and d5-chlorobenzene
(99% isotope purity) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO, U.S.A.). [13C6]Chlorobenzene (99% isotope
purity) was from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (Tewksbury,
MA, U.S.A.). HNE (10 mg/mL in ethanol) and ONE (5 mg/mL in methyl
acetate) were purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI, U.S.A.).
Solvents used for LC–MS/MS measurements were of HPLC grade
and supplied by Fisher Scientific (Atlanta, GA, U.S.A.). Preparative
TLC plates (silica gel G, 20 cm × 20 cm, UNIPLATE-T taper plate)
were from Analtech Inc. (Newark, DE, U.S.A.), and analytical TLC silica
gel 60 F254 plates were from AMD Millipore (Billerica, MA, U.S.A.).
Charcoal-stripped human serum was ordered from Innovative Research
(Novi, MI, U.S.A.).

Synthesis of Stable Isotope Labeled DNPH
Analogues
The isotope-labeled “heavy” hydrazines, d3-DNPH, [13C6]DNPH, [15N4]DNPH, and [15N2]DNPH,
were synthesized
according to routine procedures based on the nucleophile substitution
reaction between hydrazine and 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene, as reported
before.14 First, the appropriately labeled
2,4-dinitrochlorobenzenes were synthesized; d3-2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene and [13C6]2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene
were prepared from d5-chlorobenzene and
[13C6]chlorobenzene, respectively, in a mixture
of KNO3/H2SO4. The 15N-labeled
2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene was obtained from chlorobenzene in a mixture
of [15N]KNO3/H2SO4. Then,
the individual 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzenes were reacted with hydrazine
in acetic acid, with the exception of the synthesis leading to [15N4]DNPH where [15N2]hydrazine
sulfate was used. Each product was then purified on preparative TLC
using hexane/ethyl acetate (6:1, v/v). On analytical TLC, we detected
only one UV–vis spot, with Rf =
0.63, using hexane/ethyl acetate (6:1, v/v).

For the derivatization
of the carbonyls, individual DNPH reagents (light and heavy: d3-, [15N2]-, [15N4]-, or [13C6]-labeled) were dissolved
in formic acid/acetonitrile 1:50 (v/v) to obtain 1 mg/mL of derivatizing
stock solutions.

Sample Solutions for the Evaluation of Isotope
Effect
Stock solutions of MDA, ACR, HNE, and ONE, respectively,
were prepared
freshly in acetonitrile at 1 mg/mL concentration for each aldehyde.
Aliquots of 10 μL of each aldehyde were added into 160 μL
of derivatizing solution containing the light or individual heavy
(d3-, [15N2]-, [15N4]-, or [13C6]-labeled)
DNPH, respectively. The samples were incubated at 40 °C for 2
h in the dark. Then, equal aliquots (10 μL) of the light hydrazones’
mixture and each of their heavy hydrazones’ mixture were brought
together, resulting in four heavy–light labeled solutions of
the derivatized aldehydes. These samples were then diluted with 50%
(v/v) acetonitrile to obtain 0.1 and 1.0 μg/mL solutions (expressed
in terms of free carbonyl content), respectively, for isotope effect
screenings.

Evaluation of Isotope Effect Using Screening
Experimental Designs
A Surveyor LC system (Thermo Electron
Corporation, Trace Chemical
Analysis, Austin, TX, U.S.A.) was employed throughout the studies.
A Phenomenex Kinetex phenyl-hexyl silica column (50 mm × 2.1
mm i.d., 5 μm particles) protected by a Phenomenex 2 mm ×
2.1 mm i.d. SecurityGuard phenyl-hexyl silica guard column (PhenHex)
and a Phenomenex Kinetex C18 column (50 mm × 2.1 mm i.d., 5 μm
particles) protected by a Phenomenex 2 mm × 2.1 mm i.d. SecurityGuard
C18 guard column (C18) were used to assess the isotope effect. RPLC
conditions, including mobile phase pH, column temperature, and gradient
time, are summarized in Table 1. The k* gradient retention factors were within the recommended
optimal range (0.5 < k* < 20) for analytical
HPLC.21 The selected seven factors to study
their effects on the chromatographic isotope effects are shown in
Table S-1 (Supporting Information). An
asymmetrical experimental design (Table S-2 in the Supporting Information) was constructed from Addelman’s
basic plan using a template proposed by Hund et al.25 The experiments were sorted according to RP analytical
columns and mobile phases used, from practical reasons. The Plackett–Burman
experimental design (Table S-3 in the Supporting
Information) was set up according to Vander Heyden et al.26 To investigate the influence of uncontrolled
factors such as time effects due to response drifts, we repeated selected
experiments, e.g., experiment 1 in Supporting
Information Table S-2 and experiment 12 in Supporting Information Table S-3, before and after executing
the sequences specified in these tables. Statistical and graphical
interpretations of data included visual inspection of half-normal
probability plots and estimation of the critical effects such as negligible
factor effects (Ecritical), and margin
of error (ME), and simultaneous margin of error (SME).26

RPLC Conditions
for the Quantification of Hydrazones
Analyses were done using
the same PhenHex column (50 mm × 2.1
mm i.d., 5 μm particles) as specified above with gradient elution
at 30 °C. The mobile phase was a mixture of (A1) 0.1%
(v/v) acetic acid in water and (B1) acetonitrile (see Table 1), with linear gradient from 40% B to 100% B in
4 min. Then, the column was flushed with 100% B for 1 min and, finally,
was re-equilibrated with 40% B for 3 min. Flow rate was maintained
constant at 0.4 mL/min, and the injection volume was 5 μL.

Mass Spectrometry
LC–MS/MS analysis of the light
and heavy DNPH derivatives was performed on a TSQ Quantum Ultra (Thermo
Electron Corporation) mass spectrometer equipped with heated ESI (H-ESI)
probe. With the exception of DNPH–MDA, negative ion mode was
applied. H-ESI spray voltage, H-ESI temperature, and capillary temperature
were maintained at 3.5 and −3.0 kV (positive and negative ionization,
respectively), 350, and 325 °C, respectively. Nitrogen sheath
gas and auxiliary gas flow rates were 30 and 25 arbitrary units (corresponding
to approximately 0.45 and 7.5 L/min according to the manufacturer’s
specification), respectively. Collision-induced dissociation was performed
with argon at 1.5 mTorr pressure. Selected reaction monitoring (SRM)
with unit mass resolution for the precursor and product ions was used
for quantification (Table S-4 in the Supporting
Information). Tube lens voltage was optimized for MDA–DNPH
and HNE–DNPH in positive and negative mode, respectively. The
optimal collision energy determined for each hydrazone was obtained
by direct infusion experiments. Data acquisition and processing were
carried out by the Xcalibur software (version 2.1).

Direct infusion
and isocratic (acetonitrile/water/acetic acid, 50:50:0.1, v/v; all
other LC parameters are specified above in the previous section) RPLC–MS
scan and MS/MS product ion scan (Figure S-1 in the Supporting Information) analysis was applied for the confirmation
of identity and for assessment of purity of the labeled DNPHs. We
estimated that the purity was >98% after preparative TLC purification
for each reagent.

Animals and Tissue Collection
Ovariectomized
CD-1 mice
were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN, U.S.A.).
All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee at the UNT Health Science Center. Animals were
euthanized by intraperitoneal administration of 60 mg/kg ketamine
and 10 mg/kg xylazine. Brain and liver were collected and processed
immediately.

Sample Preparation for Quantification
Tissue extracts
were prepared in a BeadBug microtube homogenizer D1030 (Benchmark
Scientific, Edison, NJ, U.S.A.). Brain and liver (100 mg) were mixed
with 400 μL of acetonitrile/water (3:1, v/v) containing 25 μg/mL
BHT, a strong phenolic antioxidant, in a 2 mL homogenizer tube prefilled
with zirconium beads (1.5 mm i.d.) and homogenized for 3 min at 3300
rpm. The tissue homogenate was centrifuged (5 min at 14 500
rpm), and the clean supernatant was separated. It was then spiked
with different amounts (ranging from 20 to 2000 ng/g fresh tissue)
of MDA, ACR, and HNE to obtain quality control (QC) samples for quantification
according to the AIDA protocol.24 Briefly,
to a 100 μL aliquot of a QC sample 100 μL of light or
heavy derivatizing stock solution was added. The reaction was carried
out as specified above. ICD standards (i.e., heavy- and light-labeled
DNPH–aldehyde mixtures) were prepared in 100 μL of charcoal
stripped human serum precipitated with 300 μL acetonitrile containing
BHT (25 μg/mL). After centrifugation, the clear supernatant
was spiked with 200 ng of MDA, 100 ng of ACR, and 100 ng of HNE and
derivatized as specified above. After derivatization, the samples
were diluted with 800 μL of acetonitrile. An amount of 200 μL
of heavy-labeled ICD standard was then added to 200 μL of light-labeled
QC sample, and 200 μL of light-labeled ICD standard was added
to 200 μL of heavy-labeled QC sample. Next, the resultant mixtures
were diluted with 1.6 mL water and subjected to solid-phase extraction
(SPE). Briefly, Supelclean LC-18 SPE cartridges (1 mL, 100 mg; Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) were conditioned with 1 mL of acetonitrile,
then with 1 mL of 0.1% formic acid in water. After sample loading,
the cartridges were washed with 2 × 1 mL of water/acetonitrile/formic
acid (70:30:0.1, v/v), and the hydrazones were then eluted with 2
× 200 μL of acetonitrile. The effluents were dried at room
temperature in an Eppendorf Vacufuge (Hauppauge, NY, U.S.A.) and reconstituted
in 50 μL of 50% acetonitrile for subsequent LC–MS/MS
analysis. All samples were analyzed within 3 days.24 No aldehydes were detected in the unspiked blank QC samples;
therefore, blank correction24 was not applied
in AIDA calculations.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical
evaluations were carried
out with the XLSTAT (version 2014.1.01) and the Primer of Biostatistics
(version 5.0; McGraw-Hill, New York, NY, U.S.A.) software. Statistical
differences between means of data sets were determined with one-way
ANOVA at p < 0.05. Statistical interpretation
of the method comparison test results was achieved following the guidelines
proposed in previous reports.27−29 Linear regression lines were
obtained by using the Deming regression model.28 Percentile differences were visualized in Bland–Altman
plots.27 Normal distribution of the data
was confirmed with the Shapiro–Wilk test.

Results and Discussion
Multivariate approaches employed by screening experimental designs25,26 have several advantages over the classically applied one-variable-at-a-time
methodologies, where only one factor at a time is changed. Specifically,
screening experimental designs calculate the influence of a given
factor at several levels through combinations with other factors,
which permits general conclusions.25,26,30 Moreover, they permit the evaluation of relatively
large number of factors in a relatively small number of experiments,
and thus, the strategy can be used in high-throughput assays.

First, we employed asymmetrical screening experimental design (Supporting Information Table S-2) using factor
nos. 1–6 from Supporting Information Table S-1. The levels were chosen to cover a wide range of conditions
applied in practical gradient RPLC separations.21 Four biologically relevant reactive aldehydes (ACR, MDA,
HNE, and ONE) were selected as model compounds for these studies,
and ICD involved conversion to hydrazones with unlabeled (“light”)
and various heavy (d3-, 15N2-, 15N4-, or 13C6-) labeled DNPH. The derivatized MDA represented an early eluting
compound, retention of ACR–DNPH was intermediate, while the
derivatized HNE and ONE were late-eluting compounds upon simultaneously
analyzing these model aldehydes by gradient RPLC. As shown in Table 2 and Figure 2, both statistical
and graphical data interpretation revealed that only deuterium isotope
substitution had a significant effect on the retention time shifts,
with the exception of MDA. The latter may be due to the poor retention
(apparent retention factor, kapp <
4) of the first-eluting MDA–DNPH under the chromatographic
conditions applied. The calculated absolute effect (0.302) was slightly
larger than the margin of error (ME = 0.301) for HNE, when the 2 and
8 min gradients were compared. At the same time, it was smaller than
the simultaneous margin of error (SME = 0.490). Since there is an
increased chance for false positive decisions using ME and significance
was not confirmed by other statistical and graphical interpretation
methods, this effect may only be considered as “possibly significant”
according to Vander Heyden et al.26 Nevertheless,
the results obtained by our asymmetrical design experiment (Table 2) pointed out that neither 13C nor 15N labeling had a significant effect on retention time difference;
only deuterium isotope substitution ended up as a significant factor.
However, two-factor or higher-order interaction effects can confound
the main effects, and therefore, individual RPLC factors affecting
chromatographic deuterium isotope effect may be underestimated by
the approach. To overcome this potential problem, the asymmetric design
was deconstructed and a Plackett–Burman design was adopted
using only light- and d3-DNPH-derived
hydrazones. Results of this method are listed in Table 3 and plotted in Figures 3 and 4.

In agreement with findings
concluded from the asymmetric experimental
plan (Table 2), no significant effects were
identified for MDA–DNPH (Table 3) with
the Plackett–Burman approach. For ACR, we found only one factor
(the organic modifier in the mobile phase) that had significant effect
on the retention time difference between the ACR–DNPH and d3-ACR–DNPH upon comparing the absolute
effect (0.560) with critical effect derived from negligible factor
effects (Ecritical = 0.513). On the other
hand, the gradient time had significant effect for the two late-eluting
analytes (HNE–DNPH and ONE–DNPH). All three data interpretation
methods (i.e., comparison to Ecritical and SME, as well as inspection of the half-normal probability plot)
confirmed this finding for the HNE derivative (Table 3), while for ONE–DNPH only “possibly significant”
effect can be concluded in terms of SME. As such, the isotope effect
can be significantly reduced for these compounds by applying a steeper
gradient slope (data not shown). It is interesting to note that the
analyte’s concentration also had significant effect, when the
absolute effects (0.228 and 0.287) were compared to the corresponding Ecritical values (0.146 and 0.247) for HNE–DNPH
and ONE–DNPH, respectively. Although the significance of analyte
concentration was not confirmed by alternative interpretation methods,
such as the considering SME or the visual inspection of the half-normal
probability plots (Figure 3), this finding
may need to be considered in terms of accuracy and precision of quantitation.
Additionally, small but significant effects of the stationary phase
and the pH of the mobile phase were also revealed for HNE–DNPH
by one of interpretation methods we employed (Table 3).

To validate findings summarized in Table 3, we repeated the Plackett–Burman design
using [15N4]DNPH. This setup, however, did not
yield any statistically
significant main effects on chromatographic isotope effect (Table
S-5 and Figure S-2 in the Supporting Information). As expected, the use of [15N4]DNPH brought
about a statistically significant decrease in percentile single isotope
effect (%IE, Figure 4A) compared to d3 labeling, along with a significant decrease
in the retention time difference (ΔtR) for all aldehydes except for MDA (Figure 4B). The observed large standard deviation for the d3-labeled MDA derivative suggests that this compound is
more sensitive to changes in RPLC conditions than the later-eluting
hydrazones; we found a strong linear correlation (R2 = 0.9178) between kapp and
ΔtR (Figure S-3 in the Supporting Information). Accordingly, negligible
ΔtR can only be achieved for MDA–DNPH
when kapp < 3, while kapp ≥ 3 is recommended for bioanalytical LC–MS
applications.21

Taken together, the
only way to eliminate universally the retention
time difference between light and heavy isotopologues is when ICD
applies reagents labeled on heavy atoms (C, N, O, etc.). 15N4-labeled DNPH could be safely used for correcting LC–ESI-MS
detector response under a wide range of RPLC conditions without the
risk of manifesting significant ΔtR. Therefore, we propose the modification of the AIDA protocol24 to replace d3-DNPH
with 15N4- or 13C6-DNPH
for the derivatization of carbonyls.

Results, such as critical
resolution, analysis time, and detector
response obtained by the asymmetrical design experiment, were also
used to select the optimal RPLC conditions21 for the reliable and fast simultaneous analysis of the chosen model
aldehydes in mixtures. Satisfactory separation of HNE–DNPH
and ONE–DNPH was a very important aspect of method optimization.
The molecular masses of these hydrazones differ only by 2 Da, and
such a small difference can cause significant cross-talk effect if
these peaks overlap. As shown in Figure S-4 in the Supporting Information, we achieved acceptable resolution
(Rs ≥ 2)21 by using
acetonitrile as organic mobile phase, while the pH of the aqueous
phase and the stationary phase chemistry had only little effect. On
the other hand, acceptable separation was not obtained at all when
methanol was used. Moreover, acetonitrile considerably decreased the
analysis time, consequently increasing assay throughput. The detector
sensitivity was dramatically influenced by the mobile phase pH. As
expected, MDA–DNPH response significantly decreased upon high
pH (5 mM ammonium acetate at pH 8.2) chromatography, when positive
ion formation is not favored. The other aldehyde derivatives produced
abundant negative ions during ESI; thus, negative ionization mode
is preferred for the monitoring of these species.24,31,32 Contrary to our expectation, high pH decreased
the signal even in the negative ion mode. This unique phenomenon,
which is known as the “wrong-way-round ionization,”18,19 is actually advantageous, since efficient ionization can be obtained
using both polarity modes within one assay.

On the basis of
the results obtained by the asymmetric screening
experiment, we propose an LC–MS/MS method for quantification
of MDA, ACR, HNE, and ONE by ICD. We suggest gradient separation to
be performed using PhenHex column with low pH (0.1% acetic acid at
pH 3.3) aqueous phase and acetonitrile as the organic modifier. When
the organic content of the initial mobile phase is reduced to 40%,
adequate retention (kapp ≥ 3) for
the first-eluting MDA–DNPH can be achieved. Gradient time of
4 min and column temperature set at 30 °C also allow for the
excellent separation of the critical peak pair (RsHNE–DNPH/ONE–DNPH = 3.3) within only 3.2
min (Figure S-5 in the Supporting Information).

In order to reveal potential accuracy differences, a series
of
sample pairs were quantified based on this optimized LC–MS/MS
assay using both the previously used d3-DNPH24 and our own [15N4]DNPH reagent14 in AIDA. To compare
the proposed modification to the original method,24 we used mouse brain and liver homogenates as biological
matrixes to generate QC samples focusing on the quantification of
selected LPO end-products. The accumulation of these compounds in
various human organs and body fluids has been linked to major tissue
and cellular dysfunction believed to play a role in aging and most
age- and oxidative stress-related diseases.33 However, high lipid content make the brain and liver, besides exposing
them to well-documented LPO-related pathology34−36 and thereby
putting AIDA in the context of application to high-relevance biological
studies, ideal as complex matrixes for a comparative evaluation of
the previously developed method and the modification we propose herein.
Because we did not detect ONE upon screening the chosen mouse tissue
homogenates by LC–MS/MS using DNPH derivatization, therefore,
we conducted this evaluation with MDA, ACR and HNE as analytes. Leaving
out ONE also avoided addressing its potential conversion to E-1-hydroxynon-2-en-4-one in biological samples,37 which was beyond the scope of our work primarily
focusing on chromatographic isotope effects and its potential impact
on bioanalyses using ICD followed by LC–MS/MS.

The results
obtained by the two labeling approaches that relied
on d3-DNPH24 and [15N4]DNPH,14 respectively, as reagents are visualized on scatterplots in Figure
S-6 (Supporting Information). The statistically
significant differences in the slopes of Deming regression lines from
the lines of equality indicate that a proportional error exists between
the data generated by the use of d3-DNPH
versus [15N4]DNPH. The confidence intervals
for the biases and limits of agreement (±1.96 SD) could be estimated,
because the percentile differences followed normal distribution (data
not shown). These data are included in the Bland–Altman plots
shown in Figure 5. The measurement bias values
were calculated as 3.0%, −1.3%, and 0.4% for MDA, ACR, and
HNE, respectively. The 95% confidence intervals for the bias of these
aldehydes also include zero; therefore, measurement biases were not
significant. The limits of agreement show whether 95% of the differences
would lie between the limits, if the differences were normally distributed.
These intervals ranged from −13% to 19%, −23% to 21%,
and −9% to 10% for MDA, ACR, and HNE, respectively (Figure 5). Accordingly, the two methods in both matrixes
afforded similar quantitative results only for HNE. For the quantification
of MDA and ACR, the limit of agreement values exceeded the maximum
tolerable inaccuracy (±15%).38,39 Therefore,
these methods may not be considered equivalent or interchangeable
for the quantitative analysis of these aldehydes by AIDA from the
given matrixes.

Conclusions
The synthesis of DNPH is relatively simple.
Isotope labeling can
be customized, because several different stable isotope atoms (such
as d, 13C, 15N, and/or 18O) can be incorporated in various numbers, even at specific
positions, into the structure of this carbonyl-specific reagent. Therefore,
it provided a convenient model for comprehensive assessment of chromatographic
isotope effect, when AIDA is used as a typical ICD to analyze a subset
of the metabolome (specifically, the LPO end-products that possess
at least one carbonyl group) using LC–MS/MS.

The main
finding of this study, relying for the first time on experimental
screening designs to evaluate chromatographic isotope effects, is
that the most effective approach to avoid a chromatographic isotope
effect is through the use of non-deuterium-labeled reagents in AIDA.
When AIDA relies on deuterium-labeled reagents, one has limited options
to reduce this isotope effect universally. A steep gradient program
appeared to be the only operational parameter that reliably decreased
the retention time difference between the unlabeled and the d3-labeled hydrazones for the two late-eluting
aldehydes (HNE and ONE) selected for our study. On the other hand,
adequate separation can be impaired seriously by such conditions,
which can result in the loss of specificity for isobaric derivatives
due to cross-talk effects. A comparison of our model ICD-based quantification
using d3 or 15N4 labeling has demonstrated unacceptable inaccuracy for MDA and ACR,
even without measuring significant bias. Therefore, we recommend the
modification of the AIDA protocol24 by
including either [15N4]- or [13C6]DNPH instead of the originally proposed d3-DNPH to abolish chromatographic isotope effects and
their potential unfavorable consequences on quantitative measurements.
