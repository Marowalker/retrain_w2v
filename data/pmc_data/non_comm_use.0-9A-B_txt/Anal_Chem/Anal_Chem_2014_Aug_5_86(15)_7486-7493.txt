Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV)
is an electrochemistry technique
which allows subsecond detection of neurotransmitters in vivo. Adenosine detection using FSCV has become increasingly popular
but can be difficult because of interfering agents which oxidize at
or near the same potential as adenosine. Triangle shaped waveforms
are traditionally used for FSCV, but modified waveforms have been
introduced to maximize analyte sensitivity and provide stability at
high scan rates. Here, a modified sawhorse waveform was used to maximize
the time for adenosine oxidation and to manipulate the shapes of cyclic
voltammograms (CVs) of analytes which oxidize at the switching potential.
The optimized waveform consists of scanning at 400 V/s from −0.4
to 1.35 V and holding briefly for 1.0 ms followed by a ramp back down
to −0.4 V. This waveform allows the use of a lower switching
potential for adenosine detection. Hydrogen peroxide and ATP also
oxidize at the switching potential and can interfere with adenosine
measurements in vivo; however, their CVs were altered
with the sawhorse waveform and they could be distinguished from adenosine.
Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to determine that the
sawhorse waveform was better than the triangle waveform at discriminating
between adenosine, hydrogen peroxide, and ATP. In slices, mechanically
evoked adenosine was identified with PCA and changes in the ratio
of ATP to adenosine were observed after manipulation of ATP metabolism
by POM-1. The sawhorse waveform is useful for adenosine, hydrogen
peroxide, and ATP discrimination and will facilitate more confident
measurements of these analytes in vivo.

Fast scan
cyclic voltammetry
(FSCV) is an electrochemical technique which allows subsecond measurements
of neurotransmitters in vivo.1−3 Traditional
FSCV uses a triangular shaped waveform which is applied to a carbon-fiber
microelectrode at a scan rate of 300–400 V/s.4,5 Most FSCV research has focused on studying dopamine dynamics in
the brain,6−9 where dopamine is detected at 0.6 V and the waveform traditionally
scanned to 1.0 V.10 However, when the waveform
is extended to 1.3 V, dopamine oxidative current increases11 due to increased adsorption from oxygen functional
groups and surface renewal from breaking carbon–carbon bonds
on the surface.12 With higher scan rates
up to 2400 V/s, a sawhorse shaped waveform was implemented that holds
at a 1.3 V switching potential for a half a millisecond.13 The purpose of holding at 1.3 V was to stabilize
and renew the electrode surface and not to allow more time for dopamine
oxidation, as the surface adsorbed dopamine completely oxidized before
the hold time. Waveform optimization has proven to be an important
tool for maximizing analyte sensitivity12 and to reduce fouling1,14 at the electrode.

FSCV
has also been used to measure several other important but
more electrochemically challenging neurochemicals in the brain such
as serotonin,1 hydrogen peroxide,15 and adenosine.16 Adenosine
poses a specific challenge due to its relatively high E0 (∼1.30 V),17 so a
switching potential of 1.45–1.50 V is necessary with FSCV.16,18,19 Adenosine is a neuromodulatory
molecule found in the brain20−22 and is neuroprotective during
conditions of ischemia23,24 and hypoxia.25,26 Detection of adenosine using FSCV3,16,18 is beneficial for understanding how adenosine functions
on the subsecond to second time scale.27 A secondary peak has been observed with FSCV for adenosine detection
that can aid in distinguishing the analyte; however, the secondary
peak is harder to identify at very low concentrations.18,28

Other analytes have cyclic voltammograms (CVs) with peaks
around
the same potential as adenosine, including ATP and hydrogen peroxide,
that can interfere with adenosine detection.15,16,18 ATP can be released by exocytosis and then
metabolized extracellularly to adenosine.21 ATP and adenosine have the same electroactive adenine moiety17 and their CVs are almost identical. However,
FSCV detection of adenosine at carbon-fiber microelectrodes is 3–6
times more sensitive than for ATP, due to the negative charge of ATP.18 Unlike adenosine and ATP, hydrogen peroxide
does not have a secondary peak but the relatively slow kinetics of
hydrogen peroxide mean that the main peak is detected at a similar
potential as the primary peak for adenosine.15,15,29,30 While scanning
to higher potentials might help separate adenosine and hydrogen peroxide,
this solution is not practical due to water hydrolysis. Thus, a waveform
is needed which would allow for better discrimination between these
analytes that does not require a higher switching potential.

In this study, we used a modified sawhorse waveform to discriminate
between adenosine, ATP, and hydrogen peroxide. Holding the electrode
at the switching potential allows more time for oxidation to occur
without the need for a higher switching potential. We found that holding
the electrode at the switching potential for 1.0 ms is sufficient
to lower the oxidizing potential used for adenosine detection. Higher
amounts of current were observed for adenosine with a 1.35 V switching
potential at the sawhorse waveform compared to the triangle waveform.
Holding for 1.0 ms at the switching potential produced an extra peak
in the adenosine CV which was not present for hydrogen peroxide; thus,
the two compounds could be distinguished from one another. Principal
component analysis (PCA) was used to discriminate between adenosine,
ATP, hydrogen peroxide, and dopamine, and the sawhorse waveform was
better for distinguishing between the analytes. Mechanically stimulated
adenosine in slices was accurately predicted as adenosine using the
sawhorse waveform. Overall, adenosine can be detected with higher
sensitivity and selectivity at lower potentials with the sawhorse
waveform.

Methods
Chemicals
Adenosine and dopamine
standards were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and ATP was purchased from Tocris
Biosciences (Bristol, United Kingdom) and dissolved in 0.1 M HClO4 for 10 mM stock solutions and diluted daily in Tris buffer
for testing. Hydrogen peroxide (30 %) was purchased from Macron Fine
Chemicals (Center Valley, PA) and diluted daily in Tris buffer to
its final concentration. The Tris buffer solution consists of 15 mM
Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 2.0 mM Na2SO4, 3.25 mM KCl, 140 mM NaCl,
1.2 mM CaCl2 dehydrate, and 1.2 mM MgCl2 hexahydrate
at pH 7.4 (all Fisher, Suwanee, GA). For slice experiments, calibrations
and training set solutions were performed in artificial cerebral spinal
fluid (aCSF): 126 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 2.4 mM CaCl2 dehydrate, 1.2 mM MgCl2 hexahydrate, 25 mM NaHCO3, 11 mM glucose, and 15 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)
aminomethane, pH 7.4 (all Fisher, Suwanne GA). POM-1 (sodium polyoxotungstate),
an NTPDase 1,2 and 3 inhibitor, was purchased from Tocris. All aqueous
solutions were made with deionized water (Milli-Q Biocel, Millipore,
Billerica, MA).

Carbon-Fiber Microelectrodes
Carbon-fiber
microelectrodes
were fabricated from T-650 carbon-fibers (gift from Cytec Engineering
Materials, West Patterson, NJ)31 and cylinder-shaped
electrodes, approximately 50–100 μm long, were used.
Electrodes were sealed with Epon Resin 828 (Miller-Stephenson, Danbury,
CT) and cured with 14% (w/w) 1,3-phenylenediamine hardener (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO). All electrodes were soaked for 10 min in isopropanol
(Fisher Scientific) prior to use.

Electrochemistry Measurements
Fast-scan cyclic voltammograms
were collected using a ChemClamp (Dagan, Minneapolis, MN), and data
was collected using Tarheel CV software (gift of Mark Wightman, UNC)
using a home-built data analysis system and two computer interface
boards (National Instruments PCI 6052 and PCI 6711, Austin, TX). The
electrode was scanned from −0.4 to 1.45 V (vs Ag/AgCl) and
back with a scan rate of 400 V/s and a repetition rate of 10 Hz for
the triangle waveform. For the sawhorse waveform, the electrode was
scanned from −0.4 to 1.35 V and held for 1.0 ms before ramping
back down, at a scan rate of 400 V/s and 10 Hz repetition rate.

Brain Slice Experiments
Male Sprague–Dawley
rats (250–350 g, Charles River, Willmington, MA) were housed
in a vivarium and given food and water ab libitum. All experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee
of the University of Virginia. Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane
(1 mL/100 g rat weight) in a desiccator prior to slice preparation
and were immediately beheaded. The brain was removed within 2 min
and placed in 0–5 °C aCSF for 2–4 min for recovery.
A vibratome (LeicaVT1000S, Bannockburn, IL) was used to prepare 400
μm slices of the prefrontal cortex. Slices were transferred
to oxygenated aCSF (95% oxygen, 5% CO2) and allowed to
recover for approximately an hour before the experiment. aCSF (35–37
°C, maintained by an IsoTemp 205 water bath, Fisher Scientific)
flowed over the brain slice at 2 mL/min. The electrodes were inserted
50 μm beneath the tissue, and the waveform was applied for 20
min before data collection. The slice was mechanically stimulated
by using a micromanipulator to lower a glass pipet 50 μm. The
pipet was ∼15 μm in diameter and located about 30 μm
away from the working electrode. A PCA training set was collected
by pressure ejection of adenosine, hydrogen peroxide, and ATP onto
brain slices by a Parker Hannifin picospritzer (Picospritzer III,
Cleveland, OH). The pipet was 30–50 μm from the carbon-fiber
microelectrode. The ejection parameters were 10 psi for 100–400
ms and 100–800 nL of analyte (either 25 μM adenosine,
ATP, or H2O2) was delivered to generate a training
set in slices. All training sets were collected after mechanical stimulation.

For the POM-1 experiment, a training set of adenosine and ATP was
generated followed by applying a mixture of 25 μM adenosine
and 25 μM ATP. POM-1 (100 μM) in oxygenated aCSF was flowed
over the slice for 30 min, and the mixture was applied again.

Principal
Component Analysis
Principal component analysis
software was written in LabView Mathscript RT Module (from Mark Wightman
and Richard Keithley, UNC Chapel Hill). A training set was compiled
for each analyte tested (adenosine, ATP, hydrogen peroxide, and dopamine).
Principal components were extracted from the training set and the
data was analyzed using principal component regression.32 Mixtures of known concentrations of adenosine
with hydrogen peroxide, ATP, or dopamine were analyzed. Every training
set has residuals which account for currents from unknown signals,
such as noise.33 The Q-score is the sum
of squares of the residuals for each variable. This was calculated,
and any signal above Q failed and was not used in the analysis. In
slices, a training set was generated by applying adenosine, hydrogen
peroxide, and ATP in the brain slice.

Statistics
All
values are reported as the mean ±
standard error of the mean (SEM). All statistics were performed in
GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA) and considered
significant at the 95% confidence level (p < 0.05).
One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post tests were used to analyze the
switching potential optimization and plateau time optimization experiments.
Unpaired t tests were used to compare the currents
at the switching potentials for the triangle and sawhorse waveform.
Unpaired t tests were also used to compare adenosine
concentration predicted by PCA to the actual value for mechanically
stimulated adenosine.

Results and Discussion
Comparison of the Triangle
and Sawhorse Waveform
Cyclic
voltammograms (CVs) for adenosine, ATP, and hydrogen peroxide have
similar features at the traditional adenosine triangle waveform. Figure 1A shows background-subtracted current versus waveform
time plots for 5 μM adenosine, 10 μM hydrogen peroxide,
5 μM ATP, and 5 μM dopamine using the triangle waveform
(−0.4 to 1.45 V and back at 400 V/s). The waveform trace is
plotted on each of the plots (black dotted line) so that peak positions
during the waveform can be analyzed. The main oxidation peak for adenosine,
hydrogen peroxide, and ATP is right at, or slightly after, the switching
potential. Adenosine has a secondary peak that appears around 1.0
V, which is more prominent at higher concentrations. ATP has the same
oxidation reaction as adenosine, and the traces are similar except
that carbon-fiber microelectrodes are more sensitive to adenosine.16,18,19 Dopamine has a peak at 0.6 V
and is shown as a control for comparison purposes.34−36

Figure 1 Current versus waveform
time plots for the (A) triangle and (B)
sawhorse waveform. The triangle waveform is the traditional adenosine
waveform for FSCV (−0.4 to 1.45 V and back at 400 V/s). The
optimized sawhorse waveform is scanning from −0.4 to 1.35 V,
holding for 1.0 ms, and ramping back down to −0.4 V at a rate
of 400 V/s. The data were collected at two separate electrodes. The
dotted black line shows the shape of the waveform over time and the
blue line represents the current vs applied waveform time. Data are
plotted as current versus time instead of voltage because of the hold
time in the sawhorse waveform; 5 μM adenosine, 10 μM hydrogen
peroxide, 5 μM ATP, and 5 μM dopamine were tested.

Keithley et al. first introduced
the idea of a sawhorse waveform
for dopamine detection using FSCV,13 but
the purpose of the sawhorse was to enhance electrode stability at
scan rates exceeding 2000 V/s. Here, a modified sawhorse waveform
was used to allow more time for analyte oxidation at the switching
potential. Figure 1B shows background-subtracted
current versus waveform time plots for the sawhorse waveform which
scans from −0.4 to 1.35 V, holds for 1.0 ms, and then scans
back down to −0.4 at 400 V/s. The current versus waveform time
plots for the sawhorse waveform are from a different electrode than
the triangle waveform plots because scanning to a higher potential
can irreversibly change the electrode surface.12 Traditionally, CVs are plotted as current versus voltage
but due to the voltage plateau in the sawhorse waveform, the data
are better visualized as a plot of current vs applied waveform time.
The waveform is also superimposed on each plot in Figure 1.

Analytes which oxidize at the switching
potential (adenosine, ATP,
and hydrogen peroxide) look similar at the triangle waveform; however,
at the sawhorse waveform the analytes are more distinguishable. The
first difference between the plots from the sawhorse and triangle
waveform is during the holding time. The background charging current
decays during the holding potential (Figure 2A,B) due to the exponential decay in capacitive charging. The faradaic
current in the background subtracted current versus waveform time
plot also decreases. For adsorption controlled species, the current
will return to zero when all of the surface adsorbed species is oxidized.
For diffusion controlled species, the current decays much slower.
H2O2 is diffusion controlled (Figure S-1 in
the Supporting Information) and its current
falls off slowly with time during the holding potential (Figure 1B). Log plots of current vs time show a significantly
slower rate of decay for hydrogen peroxide than for adenosine and
ATP (Figure S-2 in the Supporting Information). Adenosine is primarily adsorption controlled,16 and its current drops off faster at the switching potential
than the current for hydrogen peroxide. ATP is also adsorption controlled
(Figure S-1 in the Supporting Information) and because less is adsorbed than adenosine, the signal is back
to zero at the end of the holding potential even though the rate of
decay is similar to that for adenosine (Figure S-2 in the Supporting Information). Dopamine has no peak
at the plateau because all the surface adsorbed dopamine is oxidized
before that time.

Figure 2 Background current for both waveforms. (A) Background
current for
the traditional triangle waveform (−0.4 to 1.45 at 400 V/s)
is plotted in red and the black dashed line is the shape of the waveform
over time. (B) Background current for the optimized sawhorse waveform
(−0.4 to 1.35 V, hold for 1.0 ms at 400 V/s) is plotted in
red and the black line denotes the shape of the sawhorse waveform
over time. The sawhorse background current shows a drop in capacitive
current at the plateau time.

Upon ramping back down, an extra peak for adenosine occurs
in the
sawhorse waveform. The extra peak is likely due to a background change
after adenosine adsorption. The adsorption of a species to the electrode
changes the background charging current due to differences in surface
area or exposed surface oxide groups. Previous studies suggests that
scanning to high anodic potentials causes electrode surface renewal
due to breaking of carbon–carbon bonds.12 If the surface was completely renewed on each scan, you
would not expect a subsequent adsorption peak upon ramping back down.
However, it is unclear how long the electrode needs to be held at
high potentials in order to completely renew the surface. In the previous
report, complete surface renewal occurred after 15 min of electrode
cycling to high potentials;12 therefore,
it is unlikely that the electrode surface would be completely renewed
after 1.0 ms of holding at the anodic potential, allowing adsorption
peaks for adenosine to be observed. Hydrogen peroxide is not adsorption
controlled (Figure S-1 in the Supporting Information) and does not have any of the extra peaks. ATP has less of a secondary
peak and fewer of the extra peaks than adenosine, likely because less
adsorbs due to its charge. The extra peak on the downward scan is
also observed for adenine oxidation but is much smaller in current
(Figure S-3 in the Supporting Information). Adenine is the nucleobase of adenosine and does not contain the
ribose unit. Because the extra peak is observed for adenosine, adenine,
and ATP but not hydrogen peroxide, it must be due to an adsorption
product of the nucleobase.

Sawhorse Waveform Optimization
The
sawhorse waveform
plateau potential and time were optimized for sufficient sensitivity
and stability of adenosine. Figure 3 shows
the effect of plateau potential (Figure 3A)
and plateau time (Figure 3B). A range of plateau
voltages were tested, from 1.25 to 1.45 V (n = 4).
Very little current was detected at 1.25 and 1.30 V, which are below
the oxidation potential for adenosine.17 A noticeable jump in sensitivity was observed at 1.35 V and the
current for this potential was significantly higher than both 1.25
and 1.30 V (one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test, p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 respectively, n = 4). Slightly higher currents were detected at 1.40 and
1.45 V; however, the amount of current was not significantly different
than 1.35 V (one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test, p > 0.05). Thus, 1.35 V was chosen as the optimal plateau potential
because it provided significantly more current than lower voltages
but was further away from the potential for water hydrolysis. In addition,
background currents were more stable at lower potentials.

Figure 3 Optimization
of the sawhorse waveform switching potential and plateau
time. (A) A range of plateau voltage spanning from 1.25 to 1.45 V
was tested. The plateau time is constant at 1.0 ms. A noticeable jump
in current for 1 μM adenosine is seen at 1.35 V. Overall current
was significantly dependent on switching potential (one-way ANOVA, p = 0.0273) and the current with 1.35 V was significantly
higher than both 1.25 and 1.30 V (Bonferroni post test, p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively, n = 4). Slightly higher currents were detected at 1.40 and
1.45 V; however, the amount of current was not significantly different
than 1.35 V (one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post test, p > 0.05, n = 4). (B) Three plateau times were
tested:
0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 ms for 5 μM adenosine. The plateau voltage
was held constant at 1.35 V. Overall, current was significantly dependent
on plateau time (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.001). Both
1.0 and 1.5 ms plateau times were significantly higher than 0.5 ms
(Bonferroni post-test, p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively, n = 4); however, 1.0
ms was not significantly different than 1.5 ms (p > 0.05).

Increasing the plateau
time increases the current detected for
1 μM adenosine at a 1.35 V plateau potential (Figure 3B, one-way ANOVA main effect of time, p = 0.0006, n = 4). The shortest plateau time (0.5
ms) resulted in the least amount of current detected. Both 1.0 and
1.5 ms plateau times were significantly higher than 0.5 ms (one-way
ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test, p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively); however, 1.0 ms was not significantly
different than 1.5 ms (p > 0.05). The background
current was less stable for 1.5 ms so 1.0 ms was chosen as optimal.
This plateau time is longer than that optimized for dopamine by Keithley
et al.;13 however, the purpose here was
to allow more time for oxidation so a longer hold time was necessary.
The stability of the optimized waveform in prefrontal cortex slices
was assessed by application of 25 μM adenosine every 30 min
for 2 h (Figure S-4 in the Supporting Information), and on average, the current detected did not change in that time
period.

The sawhorse waveform produced significantly more current
for adenosine
than the triangle waveform at 1.30 and 1.35 V switching potentials
(Figure 4, unpaired t test p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively).
With a 1.35 V upper potential, 1.3 ± 0.3 nA/μM adenosine
was detected with the triangle waveform (n = 6),
whereas 6.8 ± 1.1 nA/μM adenosine was detected with the
sawhorse (n = 6); therefore, the sawhorse waveform
offers a significant, 5-fold increase in current over the triangle
waveform at 1.35 V (unpaired t test, p < 0.001, n = 6). The currents for 1.40 and 1.45
V were not significantly different between the sawhorse and triangle
waveform (unpaired t test p >
0.05).
The limit of detection (LOD) for the triangle waveform is 34 ±
10 nM with a switching potential of 1.35 V and is 21 ± 3 nM with
1.45 V,18 whereas the LOD is 12 ±
4 nM at the sawhorse waveform with a 1.35 V switching potential (n = 6). The LOD of the sawhorse waveform is significantly
different than the triangle waveform with a 1.35 V switching potential
(unpaired t test, p < 0.05) but
not significantly different than the triangle waveform with a 1.45
V switching potential (unpaired t test, p > 0.05). The sawhorse waveform offers more sensitivity at lower
potentials than the triangle waveform.

Figure 4 Comparison of current
at both the triangle and sawhorse waveform
at various switching potentials. The plot shows average current for
each switching potential tested for both the triangle (black) and
sawhorse (gray) waveform for 1 μM adenosine. The sawhorse waveform
produced significantly more current for adenosine than the triangle
waveform at 1.30 and 1.35 V switching potential (unpaired t test p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively, n = 6).The currents for
1.40 and 1.45 V were not significantly different between the sawhorse
and triangle waveform (unpaired t test p > 0.05, n = 6).

Analyte Differentiation Using Principal Component Analysis
Hydrogen peroxide fluctuations in vivo have been
measured29 and because the CV for H2O2 is similar to adenosine, the ability to distinguish
between them would be beneficial. Carbon-fiber microelectrodes are
more sensitive to adenosine than hydrogen peroxide (6 nA/μM
vs 1.5 nA/μM, respectively) but being able to distinguish CVs
would increase confidence that hydrogen peroxide interferences could
be ruled out during adenosine monitoring in vivo.
Because the analytes have different shapes for CVs with the sawhorse
waveform, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to predict concentrations
of analytes in mixtures for both the sawhorse and triangle waveform.

Principal component analysis has been used in the past for discriminating
between dopamine and pH changes.37,38 PCA was also
used to predict dopamine concentrations in the presence of basic pH
shifts, ascorbic acid, and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC).37 With PCA, a training set is created spanning
the physiologically relevant concentrations of the analytes. For adenosine,
ATP, and dopamine, the training set was 0.2 μM, 0.5 μM,
1 μM, and 5 μM. The hydrogen peroxide training set contained
10 μM, 20 μM, 30 μM, and 50 μM to match physiological
concentrations and because our electrodes are not as sensitive to
hydrogen peroxide. From the training set, eigenvalues are calculated;
the largest eigenvalues correspond to the principal components with
the highest variance and thus best correlate to the data.39 A residual Q-score from the training set is
used to reject data that does not significantly match the principal
components. A training set was compiled for each analyte individually
with each waveform and then mixtures of analytes were tested and PCA
used to predict the concentration of each analyte in the mixture.

Mixtures of adenosine with hydrogen peroxide, ATP, or dopamine
were analyzed using both the triangle and sawhorse waveform. Tables 1 and 2 show adenosine predictions
in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, ATP, or dopamine for the triangle
and sawhorse waveform, respectively. The first column of values is
from a mixture of 5 μM adenosine and 10 μM hydrogen peroxide.
For the triangle waveform, PCA underestimated the adenosine and overestimated
the hydrogen peroxide concentration in the mixture (Table 1). Table S-1 in the Supporting
Information gives statistical data using t tests that show the predicted adenosine and H2O2 concentrations are significantly different from the actual values.
Small amounts of ATP and dopamine were also predicted, when none were
present. In comparison, for the sawhorse waveform, PCA predicted concentrations
of adenosine and hydrogen peroxide that were much closer to the actual
concentration and negligible amounts of ATP and dopamine were predicted
(Table 2, column 1, Table S-1 in the Supporting Information for statistics). The second
column of values gives predicted concentrations from a mixture of
5 μM adenosine and 1 μM ATP. Again, with the triangle
waveform, the adenosine concentration was underestimated and the ATP
concentration overestimated (Table 1). A large
portion of the adenosine and ATP mixture was attributed to hydrogen
peroxide, which was not present. However, for the sawhorse waveform,
the predicted values were closer to the actual values of adenosine
and ATP and very little hydrogen peroxide was predicted (Table 2). Lastly, the third column of values in Tables 1 and 2 is predicted concentrations
for a mixture of 5 μM adenosine and 1 μM dopamine. As
with the other mixtures, the principal component analysis was much
better at predicting the concentrations at the sawhorse waveform and
did not predict high amounts of hydrogen peroxide or ATP, which were
not present. A mixture of three analytes was also tested at the sawhorse
waveform: 5 μM adenosine, 10 μM H2O2, and 1 μM ATP. On average 3.7 ± 0.3 μM adenosine,
9.4 ± 0.7 μM hydrogen peroxide, and 1.2 ± 0.2 μM
ATP were predicted, which were similar to the values predicted for
mixtures of two components. Hydrogen peroxide and ATP predictions
were not significantly different than actual values; however, the
adenosine prediction was different than the actual value (unpaired t test, p = 0.0038, n =
5), as the model under-predicted its concentration. Thus, it is harder
to distinguish mixtures of three components than two components.

± SEM (n = 4).

All the values predicted for the triangle waveform
(except for
the ATP prediction in the adenosine/ATP mixture) were significantly
different than the actual concentrations (Table S-1 in the Supporting Information, unpaired t test, p < 0.001). However, for the sawhorse
waveform, predicted values were not significantly different than the
actual values for the two component mixtures (Table S-1 in the Supporting Information). Thus, the sawhorse waveform
in conjunction with principal components analysis is good for discriminating
hydrogen peroxide from adenosine and predictions with PCA are more
accurate than using the triangle waveform. Adenosine and ATP are the
hardest to distinguish with either waveform; however, the sawhorse
waveform was able to predict concentrations of ATP and adenosine in
a mixture more accurately. While pharmacology would also be useful in vivo to help discriminate ATP and adenosine, this method
is the best electrochemical method currently available for determining
both in a mixture.

Mechanically Stimulated Adenosine Release
Is Predicted As Adenosine
in Brain Slices
Previously, mechanically stimulated adenosine
release in the prefrontal cortex was characterized.40 Lowering the electrode 50 μm in the brain slice caused
adenosine release that was confirmed to be only adenosine by using
pharmacological tests and enzyme sensors specific for adenosine and
ATP. Mechanically stimulated adenosine release was also detected immediately
after lowering a glass pipet of similar size near the working electrode.
Here, we measured mechanically stimulated adenosine release in the
prefrontal cortex with the sawhorse waveform. An in slice training
set was generated by applying adenosine, ATP, and hydrogen peroxide
in the slice after mechanical stimulation data had been collected
(Figure 5A). The analytes were applied in a
range of amounts to achieve different local concentrations at the
electrode, just like the in vitro training set, and
the concentrations at the electrode were calculated based on a precalibration
factor. The calculated adenosine concentration based on the precalibration
was compared to the adenosine concentration predicted by PCA in order
to verify the accuracy of the prediction. Mechanically stimulated
adenosine release (Figure 5B) has the same
features as the exogenously applied adenosine (Figure 5A). Mechanically stimulated release does have an extra negative
peak at the beginning of the current versus time plot, likely due
to tissue disturbance from moving a glass pipet in tissue which could
cause an ionic change (the negative peak was previously observed with
the triangle waveform in past studies).40 The extra peak may also be an unidentified molecule released during
mechanical perturbation. Nevertheless, the PCA predictions were as
expected, as the predicted signal was predominantly adenosine with
negligible amounts of ATP and hydrogen peroxide (Figure 5C). The actual concentration and predicted concentrations
of adenosine were not significantly different from one another (unpaired t test, p > 0.05, n =
8). This experiment proved that the sawhorse waveform could be used
in tissue to predict adenosine concentrations.

Figure 5 Mechanically evoked adenosine
using the sawhorse waveform. The
medial prefrontal cortex of a rat brain slice was mechanically stimulated
by a glass pipet lowered approximately 30 μm away from the carbon-fiber
microelectrode. After mechanical stimulation, an in slice training
set was collected for adenosine, hydrogen peroxide, and ATP via exogenous
application near the electrode. (A) An example adenosine training
set in a slice. (B) An example of a mechanically evoked adenosine
CV in a slice. (C) A comparison of the predicted values using PCA
for the sawhorse waveform compared to the actual value if the release
was all adenosine (black bar). The actual concentration and predicted
concentrations of adenosine were not significantly different from
one another (unpaired t test, p >
0.05, n = 8). Negligible amounts of hydrogen peroxide
and ATP were predicted.

The shape of the adenosine CVs at the sawhorse waveform in
slices
changed slightly from in vitro, likely due to the
differences in the tissue environment versus buffer. These differences
dictate that an in situ training set must be used,
as has been used for all previous PCA work.41 For example, PCA has been used to identify adenosine transients in vivo, but the training set was large in vivo transients detected with the triangle waveform.27 For dopamine, stimulated release in vivo was used as the training set to predict the concentration of spontaneous
dopamine transients.37,42 Here, we applied analytes to
generate an in slice calibration set and the shapes of the mechanically
stimulated adenosine release match well with the in slice calibration
set.

In addition to predicting mechanically stimulated adenosine
release
in the prefrontal cortex, PCA with the sawhorse waveform was used
to analyze mixtures of adenosine and ATP before and after administering
an ATP metabolism inhibitor, POM-1. ATP can break down to adenosine
on the millisecond time frame;43 thus,
predicting mixtures of adenosine and ATP in a slice, not in the presence
of a drug, could be convoluted. In this experiment, an in slice training
set for adenosine and ATP was generated and then a mixture of 25 μM
adenosine and 25 μM ATP (1:1 ratio) was applied. Next, the brain
slice was bathed in 100 μM POM-1 in aCSF for 30 min and the
mixture of adenosine and ATP was applied again. PCA was used to predict
the concentrations of adenosine and ATP that reached the electrode
before and after POM-1 and the ratio of ATP to adenosine in the mixture
was compared. The predicted ratio of ATP/adenosine before POM-1 was
1.3 ± 0.4 and after POM-1 it was 5.3 ± 1.3 (paired t test, p = 0.0426, n =
5). Since POM-1 blocks ATP from breaking down to adenosine, an increase
of the ATP/adenosine ratio was expected. On average, after POM-1 the
predicted adenosine decreased to 69 ± 18% of initial adenosine
and ATP increased to 286 ± 66%. This experiment shows that the
sawhorse waveform is useful for assessing ratios of adenosine and
ATP in tissue.

Advantages of Modified Waveforms versus Modified
Electrodes
Electrode modifications with polymers and/or carbon
nanotubes have
been used extensively in the past to increase sensitivity and specificity
but they require extra fabrication time and cost of materials.1,18,44,45 Nafion-CNT modified electrodes have enhanced sensitivity and selectivity
for adenosine over ATP but the shape of the voltammograms were not
different for ATP and adenosine and the sensitivity for hydrogen peroxide
was never characterized.18 Carbon nanotube
yarns have been recently characterized for adenosine and hydrogen
peroxide detection. While adenosine also has a secondary peak with
those materials, discrimination of the two analytes was not tested.46 Enzyme sensors for adenosine or ATP can be used
to accurately measure each compound separately, but a single sensor
cannot discriminate between mixtures and endogenous H2O2 can be an interfering agent because the enzymes ultimately
produce and electrochemically detect H2O2.47 Overall, the sawhorse waveform provides analyte
discrimination of adenosine, ATP, and hydrogen peroxide and could
be used to further enhance the detection of other neurochemicals in vivo.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a new
waveform was developed for adenosine, hydrogen
peroxide and ATP detection. The sawhorse waveform was first implemented
to increase electrode stability at high scan rates as holding at the
plateau oxidized and renewed the electrode surface.13 We used the regular 400 V/s scan rate but focused on maximizing
current for analytes that oxidize at the plateau potential. The sawhorse
waveform allowed a lower switching potential than the traditional
triangle waveform to be used and produced lower limits of detection.
With the sawhorse waveform, adenosine has a different shape at the
plateau potential and extra peaks due to adsorbed products; thus,
it can be distinguished from dopamine, ATP, and hydrogen peroxide.
PCA was used to predict concentrations in mixtures and in slices,
confirming that the sawhorse waveform is better for discriminating
adenosine in a mixture. Mechanically stimulated adenosine in prefrontal
cortex slices was accurately predicted as adenosine using the sawhorse
waveform. Overall, the sawhorse waveform is highly beneficial for
analyte differentiation and could be used in the future in
vivo to provide better selectivity at lower potentials.
