We
report the measurement of electroosmotic mobilities in nanofluidic
channels with rectangular cross sections and compare our results with
theory. Nanofluidic channels were milled directly into borosilicate
glass between two closely spaced microchannels with a focused ion
beam instrument, and the nanochannels had half-depths (h) of 27, 54, and 108 nm and the same half-width of 265 nm. We measured
electroosmotic mobilities in NaCl solutions from 0.1 to 500 mM that
have Debye lengths (κ–1) from 30 to 0.4 nm,
respectively. The experimental electroosmotic mobilities compare quantitatively
to mobilities calculated from a nonlinear solution of the Poisson–Boltzmann
equation for channels with a parallel-plate geometry. For the calculations,
ζ-potentials measured in a microchannel with a half-depth of
2.5 μm are used and range from −6 to −73 mV for
500 to 0.1 mM NaCl, respectively. For κh >
50, the Smoluchowski equation accurately predicts electroosmotic mobilities
in the nanochannels. However, for κh < 10,
the electrical double layer extends into the nanochannels, and due
to confinement within the channels, the average electroosmotic mobilities
decrease. At κh ≈ 4, the electroosmotic
mobilities in the 27, 54, and 108 nm channels exhibit maxima, and
at 0.1 mM NaCl, the electroosmotic mobility in the 27 nm channel (κh = 1) is 5-fold lower than the electroosmotic mobility
in the 2.5 μm channel (κh = 100).

==== Body
Nanofluidic devices have received
considerable attention due to their unique ion and fluid transport
properties1,2 and applications in chemical analysis.3,4 Small lateral dimensions, surface charge, and geometric asymmetry
contribute to many of these interesting transport phenomena. Nanochannel
devices exhibit concentration polarization and are able to concentrate
small molecules5 and peptides and proteins6,7 at the nanochannel and microchannel interface. Electrokinetically
mediated transport through nanoporous membranes8 can be used to create chemical gradients,9 concentrate mass-limited samples,10 and stack samples11 across microfluidic
layers separated by a membrane. When the nanoscale conduit has a geometric
asymmetry, ion current rectification occurs in quartz nanopipettes,12,13 track-etched polymer membranes,14−16 silicon-based nanochannels,17 and nanoscale funnels.18 Conical nanopores can electrokinetically trap and concentrate particles
due to the high electric field strength at the tips of the pores.19,20 Within nanochannel devices, enhanced channel conductance21 and reduced electrokinetic mobilities of small
molecules22 and DNA23 are observed. Nanochannel devices are also used for resistive-pulse
sensing of single molecules,24 ion current
rectification-based sensing,17 and separations
based on entropic sieving,25 liquid chromatography,26 electrophoresis,22 and continuous-flow Ogston and entropic sieving.27

Nanofluidic devices with in-plane nanochannels have
been fabricated
in a variety of materials by techniques such as wet chemical etching,25,27,28 double thermal oxidation and
wet chemical etching,29 sacrificial layer
deposition,30 nanoimprint lithography,31 focused ion beam (FIB) milling,32 electron-beam (e-beam) lithography with reactive-ion etching,33 and e-beam lithography and polymer replication.18,34 Fabrication techniques, such as e-beam lithography and FIB milling,
are able to create channels confined to nanometer dimensions in both
lateral dimensions, e.g., width and depth, and to generate any two-dimensional
channel pattern on the substrate surface. FIB milling has the added
advantage to directly mill channels with three-dimensional topography
during a single fabrication step. We milled the nanofluidic channels
directly into borosilicate glass with an FIB instrument, which uses
an electron flood gun to minimize surface charge generated by the
ion beam. Use of the electron flood gun circumvented the need for
a conductive film, e.g., metal, on the glass surface to dissipate
charge buildup.

In particular, we are interested in electroosmotic
flow in nanochannels
when κh is small, where κ is the Debye–Hückel
parameter35 and h is the
channel half-depth. Electroosmotic mobility decreases as the channel
dimension (e.g., h) becomes small, the Debye length
(κ–1) becomes large, or both.36,37 As the double layer extends into the channel, the profile for electroosmotic
flow goes from having a uniform velocity profile to a nonuniform profile
with a reduced average velocity. As κh approaches
1, double layer overlap occurs, the flow profile becomes parabolic,
and electroosmotic mobility reaches a minimum for a given Debye length.
This theory was extended to include an analytical solution for a cylindrical
capillary38 and parallel-plate channel.39

Subsequent work about electroosmotic flow
in nanochannels is mostly
theoretical.40,41 Numerical simulations of electrokinetically
driven fluids address the influence of channel dimensions,42,43 double layer thickness and electrostatic potential distribution,44,45 surface potential,46 and ion valence47 on electroosmotic flow. Similar to early work,36−39 finite element analysis predicts the reduction of electroosmotic
velocities when there is double layer overlap in the channel.48 Simulations also study the validity of common
approximations, in particular, the linear solution of the Poisson–Boltzmann
equation to calculate potential distributions when the surface potential
is relatively high or the electrostatic potential in the center of
the channel is zero.49 Two-dimensional
flow profiles are generated for cases in which there is significant
double layer overlap in nanochannels to account for sidewall effects.50−52 Reduction of electroosmotic velocity due to the double layer extending
into the nanochannel is observed experimentally at low buffer concentrations
in high aspect ratio channels.22,53 Also, electroosmotic
flow is measured in nanochannels with no double layer overlap by a
current-monitoring technique.54,55

We measured the
average electroosmotic mobilities and ionic conductivities
in channels with half-depths of 27 nm, 54 nm, 108 nm, and 2.5 μm
for NaCl concentrations from 0.1 to 500 mM. From these micro- and
nanochannels measurements, specific surface charge, zeta (ζ)
potentials, and electroosmotic mobilities are extracted directly from
the experimental data. The experimental electroosmotic mobilities
compare quantitatively to mobilities calculated from a nonlinear solution
of the Poisson–Boltzmann equation for channels with a parallel-plate
geometry. For the calculations, ζ-potentials measured in the
2.5 μm channel are used and range from −6 to −73
mV for 500 to 0.1 mM NaCl, respectively. For κh > 50, electroosmotic mobilities in the nanochannels are accurately
predicted by the Smoluchowski equation.56 However, for κh < 10, the electrical double
layer extends into the nanochannels, and due to confinement in the
channels, average electroosmotic mobilities decrease. At κh ≈ 4, electroosmotic mobilities in the 27, 54, and
108 nm channels exhibit maxima, and at 0.1 mM NaCl, the electroosmotic
mobility in the 27 nm channel (κh = 1) is 5-fold
lower than the electroosmotic mobility in the 2.5 μm channel
(κh = 100).

Experimental Section
Materials
We purchased chromium etchants 1020 and 8002-A
and buffered oxide etchant (BOE) from Transene Co.; Microposit MF
319 developer from MicroChem Corp.; D263 glass substrates with a 530
nm thick layer of photoresist and a 120 nm thick layer of chromium
from Telic Co.; No. 1.5 cover glass from VWR; rhodamine B and disodium
fluorescein from Sigma-Aldrich Co.; NaCl and NaOH from Mallinckrodt,
Inc.; methanol from EMD Millipore, Inc.; and 353NDT Epoxy from Epoxy
Technology, Inc.

Microchannel Fabrication
We fabricated
microfluidic
devices with and without integrated nanochannels. For the devices
with nanochannels, two V-shaped microchannels were fabricated in a
glass substrate by conventional photolithography and wet chemical
etching, and the nanochannel was milled into the substrate to bridge
the gap between the two microchannels (Figure 1). The V-shaped microchannel design was transferred into the photoresist
layer by UV exposure (200 mJ/cm2) through a photomask (HTA
Photomask). After development of the photoresist, the chromium layer
was etched with chromium etchant 8002-A, and the microchannels were
etched into the glass substrate with BOE. The microchannels were measured
with a stylus-based profiler (Dektak 6M, Veeco Instruments, Inc.)
and had a half-depth of 2.55 ± 0.2 μm and a width of 31
± 2 μm. Holes were sandblasted into the backside of the
substrate for fluid and electrical access at the ends of the microchannels.
Remaining photoresist and chromium were then removed with acetone
and chromium etchant 1020, respectively, and the glass surfaces were
cleaned in an ammonium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide, and water solution
(2:1:2), rinsed with water, and dried before FIB milling as described
below. For microfluidic devices without nanochannels, microchannels
with a cross pattern were fabricated by the same process as above.
The cross-shaped microchannels had a half-depth of 2.52 ± 0.2
μm and a width of 42 ± 2 μm.

device used for electroosmotic mobility
and conductivity measurements. Two V-shaped microchannels (represented
by thick black lines) are bridged by a nanochannel milled with a focused
ion beam (FIB) instrument. (b) Scanning electron microscope (SEM)

60 μm from the top micro- and nanochannel junction at the “detect”
location. (c) Atomic force microscope (AFM) image of a nanochannel
with a half-depth of 54 nm and half-width of 265 nm.

Nanochannel Fabrication
Nanochannels
were milled between
the two V-shaped microchannels with a dual-beam FIB instrument (AURIGA
60, Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Nanochannels with a rectangular design were
created in the NanoPatterning and Visualization Engine (FIBICS Corp.),
and a 30 kV gallium ion beam at 50 pA milled the pattern directly
into the glass while an electron flood gun bathed the substrate surface
with electrons to compensate for charge buildup. After FIB milling,
the nanochannels were characterized with the scanning electron microscope
(SEM) on the FIB instrument and an atomic force microscope (AFM; MFP-3D,
Asylum Research) to determine the nanochannel dimensions. All of the
nanochannels had a length of 76 ± 2 μm (i.e., the distance
between the two V-shaped microchannels) and half-widths of 265 ±
10 nm. We fabricated three nanochannel devices with half-depths of
27 ± 2 nm, four nanochannel devices with half-depths of 54 ±
3 nm, and two nanochannel devices with half-depths of 108 ± 5
nm.

Device Bonding
Substrates with and without integrated
nanochannels and No. 1.5 cover glass were soaked in 1 M NaOH at 60
°C for 20 min, sonicated in water for 10 min, rinsed with water,
and brought into contact with each other while wet. The bonded devices
were dried in an oven at 90 °C overnight and annealed in a furnace
at 545 °C for 12 h. Glass reservoirs (6 mm o.d. × 4 mm i.d.
× 6 mm tall) were attached over the sandblasted holes with epoxy
to hold the solutions and make electrical connections to the micro-
and nanochannels.

Nanochannel Conditioning
After bonding,
micro- and
nanochannels in the devices were sequentially rinsed with methanol,
1:1 methanol in water, water, 1 M NaOH, and water. Solutions were
drawn through the channels with vacuum for 15 min each. Devices filled
with water were stored for at least 4 days before measurements were
made to ensure reproducible electroosmotic flow. Electroosmotic flow
increased slightly from days 1 to 3, but by day 4, no significant
change in electroosmotic mobility was observed. The change in mobility
is presumably due to the dissolution of Ga ions at the glass surface
that were deposited during the FIB milling process.

Conductivity
Measurements
Channel conductivities for
each device were measured with a picoammeter/voltage source (6487
Keithley Instruments, Inc.). Silver–silver chloride electrodes
were prepared by sanding a 10 mm section of a 2 mm diameter piece
of silver wire and immersing this section of wire in an FeCl3 chloridizing solution overnight.57 The
chloridized sections of the electrodes were placed in the solution-filled
reservoirs, and the nonchloridized sections were wired to the voltage
source. With 1 V applied through silver–silver chloride electrodes,
the current was measured between each pair of reservoirs on a device,
and channel conductance was calculated from the average current for
each micro- and nanochannel by a least-squares method. Channel conductivities
were then calculated with the channel length and cross-sectional area.
We tested NaCl solutions of 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 500, and 1000 mM (pH
5.1–5.5). Channel conductivities were measured on three 27
nm channels, four 54 nm channels, two 108 nm channels, and two 2.5
μm channels. The bulk conductivity of each solution was measured
with a standard conductivity meter (1026, VWR, Inc.).

Electroosmotic
Flow Measurements
In the nanochannel
devices, we measured the electroosmotic velocity by monitoring the
arrival time of a zwitterionic dye (rhodamine B) at a location 60
μm from the micro- and nanochannel junction (the location labeled
“detect” in Figure 1b). The arrival
time of the rhodamine B was monitored on an inverted optical microscope
(IX71, Olympus, Inc.), and a green helium–neon laser focused
to a spot with a 60× objective at the detection location was
used to excite the dye. The fluorescence was collected by the objective,
spectrally filtered with the bandpass filter in the TRITC filter cube
(U-N41002, Olympus, Inc.), spatially filtered with a 100 μm
pinhole, detected with a photomultiplier tube (H5783-01, Hamamatsu
Photonics), amplified (SR570, Stanford Research Systems, Inc.), and
recorded through a multifunction data acquisition card (PCI-6032,
National Instruments Corp.) with a LabVIEW program (National Instruments
Corp.).

A positive potential (0.3–5.2 V) from an analog
output card (PCI-6713, National Instruments Corp.) controlled through
the LabVIEW program was applied through a silver–silver chloride
electrode to the sample reservoir (see Figure 1a), and a silver–silver chloride electrode inserted into the
waste reservoir was held at ground. For each set of measurements,
the NaCl concentration was stepped from lowest (0.1 mM) to highest
(500 mM), and the field strength was stepped from lowest (50 V/cm)
to highest (250 V/cm). The arrival time distribution of the dye front
in nanochannels was fitted with a sigmoidal curve, and the arrival
time corresponded to the half-height of the curve. Arrival times of
the rhodamine B solution at the detection point ranged from 70 ms
to 1.40 s for the low-salt concentrations at high field strengths
and the high-salt concentrations at low field strengths, respectively.
The time for rhodamine B to diffuse 60 μm is estimated to be
∼4 s and did not impact the electroosmotic flow measurements.

To measure the electroosmotic mobility on the cross-shaped microchannel
device, we used a pinched injection58 and
monitored the arrival time of rhodamine B 4 mm downstream from the
cross intersection. Potentials were applied to the reservoirs with
a high-voltage power supply controlled by a LabVIEW program. For measurements
made in both the nanochannel and microchannel devices, the electroosmotic
mobility was calculated from a linear fit of electroosmotic velocity
versus field strength. Similar to the conductivity measurements, electroosmotic
mobilities were measured in three 27 nm channels, four 54 nm channels,
two 108 nm channels, and two 2.5 μm channels. To check for concentration
polarization, disodium fluorescein (10 μM) was added to the
NaCl solutions and drawn into devices with the 27 nm channel for 15
min by vacuum. Potentials of 1 and 10 V, corresponding to field strengths
of 120 and 1200 V/cm in the nanochannels, respectively, were applied,
and the microchannel and nanochannel junctions were visualized on
the inverted IX71 microscope by wide-field epifluorescence.

Results
and Discussion
Nanochannel Fabrication
Rectangular
nanochannels were
fabricated in the gap between two closely spaced V-shaped microchannels
(see Figure 1). The microchannels were fabricated
by standard photolithography and wet chemical etching, and the nanochannels
were milled into the glass substrate between the microchannels with
a focused ion beam. We used an electron flood gun to minimize charge
buildup at the substrate surface caused by the ion beam. Each of the
milled nanochannels had a length of 76 ± 2 μm and width
(2w) of 530 ± 10 nm, but had depths (2h) of 54 ± 4, 108 ± 6, or 216 ± 10 nm. We
used an SEM to measure the nanochannel width and an AFM to determine
the nanochannel depth. To facilitate comparison to theory, we refer
to the channels by their half-depths (h) of 27, 54,
and 108 nm. SEM and AFM images of a nanochannel with a 54 nm half-depth
are shown in Figure 1b,c.

Channel Conductivity
We measured the ionic conductivities
in the nanochannels with half-depths of 27, 54, and 108 nm for NaCl
solutions from 0.1 to 1000 mM and compared their conductivities with
the conductivities of the bulk solutions and a microchannel with a
half-depth of 2.5 μm. At a fixed potential of 1 V, currents
in the micro- and nanochannels were measured, and channel conductance
is calculated from these current measurements recorded for each reservoir
pair. Channel conductivities are then calculated from the channel
conductance and measured channel lengths and cross-sectional areas
of the micro- and nanochannels.

Figure 2 shows the variation of the channel conductivity with NaCl concentration
and bulk solution conductivity. As expected, at high salt concentrations,
the nanochannel conductivities match the bulk solution conductivities.
However, at low salt concentrations, the nanochannel conductivities
deviate from linearity and are significantly higher than the conductivities
in the microchannel and bulk solution.18,21,59 The deviation increases as the channel half-depth
decreases, i.e., the shallowest nanochannel (h =
27 nm) has the highest conductivities for NaCl concentrations of 0.1,
1, and 10 mM. Deviation from linearity occurs because a significant
portion of the current is carried through the nanochannel by surface
charge. As the surface-to-volume ratio of the channel increases, surface
charge contributes a much greater fraction of current transported,
which results in higher channel conductivities.

Figure 2 Variation of channel
conductivity with bulk conductivity and NaCl
concentration. Channel half-depths (h) are 27 nm,
54 nm, 108 nm, and 2.5 μm. Lines for each channel half-depth
are calculated with eq 1 from the specific surface
conductivities, bulk conductivities, and channel dimensions. Measurements
were made on three devices with h = 27 nm, four devices
with h = 54 nm, and two devices with h = 108 nm and 2.5 μm. Error bars are ± σ.

The experimental channel conductivities
are in excellent agreement
with the model presented by Hunter56 adapted
to a channel with a rectangular cross-section. Equation 1 shows the channel conductivity, σc: 1  where σb is
the bulk solution conductivity, λs is the specific
surface conductivity, and w is the channel half-width.
λs is calculated from eq 1 with
an average of three conductivity measurements from each channel dimension
at each salt concentration. Figure 3 shows
the average λs for all channel depths, which ranged
from 2.15 to 137 nS for NaCl concentrations of 0.1 to 1000 mM, respectively.
When the channel cross-section is large, i.e., h and w are large, the second term of eq 1 for the contribution of the surface charge goes to zero, and the
channel conductivity matches the bulk conductivity. However, when h and w are small, the second term becomes
significant, and the channel conductivity is greater than the bulk
conductivity. Equation 1 is used to calculate
the channel conductivities from the specific surface conductivities,
bulk conductivities, and channel dimensions for each channel half-depth,
and the predicted values (lines in Figure 2) match the experimental data for all channel dimensions across all
concentrations.

Figure 3 Variation of specific surface conductivity (λs) and zeta potential (ζ-potential) with bulk conductivity
and
NaCl concentration. The specific surface conductivities are an average
for all nanochannel and microchannel devices and were measured on
three devices with h = 27 nm, four devices with h = 54 nm, and two devices with h = 108
nm and 2.5 μm. ζ-potentials were measured on two devices
with h = 2.5 μm. Error bars are ± σ.

Electroosmotic Mobility
The electroosmotic velocity
was measured in the channels with h = 27 nm, 54 nm,
108 nm, and 2.5 μm. The zwitterionic dye, rhodamine B, was added
to NaCl solutions of 0.1 to 500 mM and detected by laser-induced fluorescence.
For the nanochannel devices, a front of the rhodamine B solution was
introduced into the nanochannel, and the arrival time of the dye was
detected 60 μm from the top micro- and nanochannel junction
(the location labeled “detect” in Figure 1b). For the microchannel devices, a pinched injection58 was used to introduce a plug of rhodamine B
solution, and the arrival time of the rhodamine B plug was detected
4 mm downstream from the cross intersection. Over the range of electric
field strengths used (50–250 V/cm), the electroosmotic velocity
was linear with field strength for all NaCl concentrations. The slopes
of the lines fitted to the velocity versus field strength data are
the electroosmotic mobilities in the micro- and nanochannels. For
the linear fits, R2 > 0.999 for the
experiments
with the 0.1–100 mM NaCl solutions, and R2 > 0.998 for the experiments with the 500 mM NaCl solution.

To evaluate whether concentration polarization might impact the
conductivity and electroosmotic flow measurements, we imaged the transport
of fluorescein through the nanochannels with applied potentials of
1 and 10 V, and enrichment or depletion of the fluorescein at the
entrance or exit of the nanochannel was not observed. Although some
concentration polarization may occur, the time scale for each electroosmotic
flow measurement was relatively short, e.g., 1–5 s in duration,
because the polarity of the power supply was switched frequently to
move rhodamine B into the nanochannel and clear the dye from the nanochannel
for the next measurement. In addition, the channel conductivities
and electroosmotic mobilities in the nanochannels are consistent with
values measured in the microchannels, for which concentration polarization
is negligible (see Figures 2 and 4).

Figure 4 Variation of average electroosmotic mobility (μeo) with Debye length (κ–1) for channel half-depths
(h) of 27 nm, 54 nm, 108 nm, and 2.5 μm and
NaCl concentrations from 0.1 to 500 mM. Lines for each channel half-depth
are calculated with eq 4. Measurements were
made on three devices with h = 27 nm, four devices
with h = 54 nm, and two devices with h = 108 nm and 2.5 μm. Error bars are ± σ.

Figure 4 shows the variation of electroosmotic
mobility with Debye length (κ–1). For NaCl
concentrations of 0.1 to 500 mM, the Debye lengths for a 1:1 electrolyte
at 22 °C range from 30 to 0.4 nm, respectively.35 As expected, the electroosmotic mobilities in the 2.5 μm
channel are linear over the entire NaCl concentration range. However,
the electroosmotic mobilities in the three nanochannels at low salt
concentrations (0.1, 1, and 10 mM) are significantly reduced compared
to the electroosmotic mobilities in the microchannel. Reduction of
the electroosmotic mobility is most pronounced in the 27 nm channel
with κ–1 = 30 nm for 0.1 mM NaCl, where double
layer overlap results in a parabolic flow profile with a reduced average
mobility compared to the flat-flow profile in microchannels with a
higher average mobility.36,37,39 In addition, the electroosmotic mobilities in the nanochannels milled
by the FIB instrument are in excellent agreement with the electroosmotic
mobilities in the microchannels etched by a wet-chemical method. The
electroosmotic mobilities in the 2.5 μm channel coincide with
the electroosmotic mobilities in the 108 nm channel for NaCl concentrations
≥1 mM, in the 54 nm channel for NaCl concentrations ≥10
mM, and in the 27 nm channel for NaCl concentrations ≥100 mM.
These results suggest that the FIB-milling process does not significantly
impact the surface and ζ-potential of the nanochannels.

Theoretical electroosmotic mobilities are calculated from a nonlinear
solution of the Poisson–Boltzmann equation for a channel with
parallel-plate geometry.43 The equilibrium
potential, ψ(y), in the channel at position y perpendicular to the wall is calculated: 2  where k is the Boltzmann
constant, T is the temperature, z is the ion valence, and e is the electronic charge.
The electroosmotic velocity, ueo(y), is calculated: 3  where ε is the permittivity
of the medium,
η is the viscosity, and E is the electric field
strength. ζ-potentials measured in the 2.5 μm channel
ranged from −6 to −73 mV for NaCl concentrations from
500 to 0.1 mM, respectively (see Figure 3)
and are used in these calculations.

The
average electroosmotic mobility, μeo, is then
calculated by eq 4: 4  μeo is integrated
from the channel wall (y = 0) across the entire channel
depth (y = 2h). The permittivity
of the medium and solution viscosity for water are used and assumed
to be constant. Calculated values of μeo for each
nanochannel half-depth are plotted as lines in Figures 4 and 5 and match the experimental data
extremely well over the entire range of NaCl concentrations.

Figure 5 Variation of
average electroosmotic mobility (μeo) with κh for channel half-depths (h) of 27 nm,
54 nm, 108 nm, and 2.5 μm and NaCl concentrations
from 0.1 to 500 mM. Lines for each channel half-depth are calculated
with eq 4. Measurements were made on three devices
with h = 27 nm, four devices with h = 54 nm, and two devices with h = 108 nm and 2.5
μm. Error bars are ± σ.

For large κh where κ is the
Debye–Hückel
parameter, the ratio ψ(y)/ζ goes to zero,
and eq 3 for ueo reduces to the Smoluchowski equation.56 For small κh, ψ(y)/ζ
approaches 1, and ueo is significantly
reduced in the channel. Figure 5 shows the
variation of electroosmotic mobility with κh. In the microchannel, κh > 100 for all
electroosmotic
mobility measurements, and therefore, the electroosmotic mobilities
are linear with κh. For κh > 50, electroosmotic mobilities in the nanochannels are accurately
predicted by the Smoluchowski equation. However, for κh < 10, the electrical double layer extends into the
nanochannel, and consequently, electroosmotic mobilities decrease
as the nanochannel half-depths decrease. In Figure 5, maxima in the electroosmotic mobilities are observed at
κh ≈ 4 for all three nanochannels, and
the experimental data are in excellent agreement with predicted values.
These maxima occur at different NaCl concentrations for all three
nanochannels (see Figure 4) and indicate that
the degree of double layer overlap depends on both channel dimensions
and Debye length. Moreover, at κh ≈
4 where the average electroosmotic mobilities exhibit maxima, the
electrostatic potential in the center of the channel is zero. When
κh goes from 4 toward 1, the electrostatic
potential in the channel center becomes nonzero due to interaction
between the electrical double layers, and consequently, the average
electroosmotic mobilities decrease.

Equation 2 is a nonlinear solution of the
Poisson–Boltzmann equation that assumes a two-dimensional flow
field in channels with a parallel-plate geometry and neglects sidewall
effects.43 Our nanochannels are shallow
rectangles and have aspect ratios (w/h) of 9.8, 4.9, and 2.5 for channel half-depths of 27, 54, and 108
nm, respectively. The calculated electroosmotic mobilities match the
experimental values for the 54 and 108 nm channels, which have the
lower aspect ratios. The 27 nm channel has the highest aspect ratio
of the channels tested, and except for one point at κh = 2.8, the calculated and experimental electroosmotic
mobilities match. In our calculation, we use the ζ-potentials
measured in the 2.5 μm channel and do not account for possible
changes in the surface charge density as κh approaches 1.60 Consequently, suppression
of the electroosmotic flow is simply due to geometric confinement
of the electrical double layer in the shallow nanochannels. The model
also assumes weak double layer overlap (κh ≥
2).43 This assumption is considered valid
for all of our electroosmotic flow measurements except two measurements
made at 0.1 mM NaCl in the 27 nm channel (κh = 1) and 54 nm channel (κh = 1.8). However,
as seen in Figures 4 and 5, the calculated and experimental values match well.

Conclusion
Nanochannels with rectangular cross sections fabricated in glass
by FIB milling show enhanced ionic conductivities and reduced electroosmotic
mobilities when compared to ion and electroosmotic transport in microchannels.
These nanochannels have large surface-to-volume ratios, and consequently,
the surface conductivity dominates the ionic conductivity in the channel.
Also, as the Debye length becomes comparable to the channel half-depth
(e.g., κh < 10), the electrical double layer
extends into the channel and significantly impacts the electroosmotic
flow profile, which leads to a lower average electroosmotic velocity.
The experimental electroosmotic mobilities match theoretical predictions,
and both exhibit maxima at κh ≈ 4.
