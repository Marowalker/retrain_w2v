Bacterial
meningitis is a serious health concern worldwide. Given
that meningitis can be fatal and many meningitis cases occurred in
high-poverty areas, a simple, low-cost, highly sensitive method is
in great need for immediate and early diagnosis of meningitis. Herein,
we report a versatile and cost-effective polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/paper
hybrid microfluidic device integrated with loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (LAMP) for the rapid, sensitive, and instrument-free
detection of the main meningitis-causing bacteria, Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis). The introduction of paper into the microfluidic device for LAMP
reactions enables stable test results over a much longer period of
time than a paper-free microfluidic system. This hybrid system also
offers versatile functions, by providing not only on-site qualitative
diagnostic analysis (i.e., a yes or no answer), but also confirmatory
testing and quantitative analysis in laboratory settings. The limit
of detection of N. meningitidis is
about 3 copies per LAMP zone within 45 min, close to single-bacterium
detection sensitivity. In addition, we have achieved simple pathogenic
microorganism detection without a laborious sample preparation process
and without the use of centrifuges. This low-cost hybrid microfluidic
system provides a simple and highly sensitive approach for fast instrument-free
diagnosis of N. meningitidis in resource-limited
settings. This versatile PDMS/paper microfluidic platform has great
potential for the point of care (POC) diagnosis of a wide range of
infectious diseases, especially for developing nations.

==== Body
The emergence
of 335 infectious
diseases that have been reported between 1940 and 2004 in the global
human population has generated an extremely significant impact on
global health and economies.1,2 Among various global
infectious diseases, epidemic bacterial meningitis, a severe infection
affecting the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord
known as the meninges, is one of the most dangerous diseases due to
its high morbidity and mortality. Meningitis is a contagious disease,
which can become fatal in as early as 24 h after symptoms are noticed.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), “Worldwide,
without epidemics one million cases of bacterial meningitis are estimated
to occur and 200 000 of these die annually... Higher case-fatality
rates (37–60%) have been reported in developing countries.”3 Additionally, many meningitis cases occurred
in rural high-poverty areas, such as the so-called “meningitis
belt” in Africa, where it remains an important and unresolved
public health concern. Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis), the etiologic
agent of the meningococcal disease, is a leading cause of morbidity
and mortality in children and young adults worldwide.4,5N. meningitidis is also the dominant
etiologic bacterium in the African meningitis belt according to the
bacteriologic and epidemiologic data collected over the past 30 years.6 Usually patients with meningitis share symptoms
common to many febrile illnesses (e.g., influenza), which makes meningitis
difficult to diagnose based on clinical symptoms alone. Because of
the high fatality rate and damaging effects resulting from untreated
meningitis in rural high-poverty areas, a simple, low-cost, highly
sensitive methodology is in great need for the immediate and early
diagnosis of meningitis.

There are several laboratory guidelines
available from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the WHO for the diagnosis
of meningitis. Currently, gram stain and bacterial culture appear
to be the gold standard.7 However, both
have to be done in a laboratory setting, and bacterial culture may
take a few days. Although gram staining may aid in providing a fast
identification after reaching the laboratory, it still has many limitations.
(1) Gram stain has a lower detection rate for patients previously
treated with antimicrobial therapy. (2) Its detection sensitivity
is low. (3) It requires well-trained personnel, due to the fact that
sometimes poor staining occurs.8

Recently, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR),9,10 loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP),11−15 and latex agglutination16 tests have been reported to provide rapid detection of bacterial
meningitis. For example, there have been several reports on LAMP amplification
methods for the clinical diagnosis of meningitis.11−15 However, these methods require specialized equipment
in laboratories, such as qPCR thermocyclers (∼$60 000),
turbidimeters, centrifuges, fluorescent microscopes, and so on, which
render these methods incapable of rapid diagnosis of meningitis in
the field or in low-resource settings.

Microfluidic lab-on-a-chip
offers a unique opportunity for various
biomedical applications due to a variety of advantages associated
with miniaturization, integration, portability, and automation.17−22 It allows for significantly low reagent consumption, integrated
processing and analysis of complex biological fluids with high efficiency
and sensitivity in health care settings, as well as the possibility
of rapid detection. The substrates of a microfluidic device can significantly
affect many aspects of a microfluidic system from fabrication methods,
cost, assay procedures, to detection. Various materials including
Si,23 glass,24−28 PDMS,29−31 and paper32−35 have been used for microfluidic device fabrication.
However, each substrate material has its own advantages and limitations.
For instance, PDMS microfluidic devices are used extensively for biomedical
applications, because of its moderate cost and ease of microfabrication
(termed as soft lithography30) and transparent
property for optical detection. However, PDMS devices often require
complicated surface modification procedures to immobilize biosensors
on a chip. Recently, paper-based microfluidic devices afford a new
low-cost platform for different applications related to health care
in low-resource settings.34−36 Paper-based devices however do
not offer the high performance in flow control found in PDMS devices.
Therefore, we previously developed a PDMS/paper hybrid microfluidic
system, in which paper facilitated the integration of graphene oxide-based
nanosensors on the chip, without any complicated surface treatment.37

Recently, microfluidic chips integrated
with LAMP reactions have
been developed for rapid pathogen detection including S. aureus, E. coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and
so on.31,38−41 These microfluidic chips showed
potential for fast infectious disease diagnosis using miniaturized
devices coupled with different detections such as colorimetric,39 absorbance,31,41 and electrochemical
detections.40 For instance, Safavieh et
al. developed a cassette-like device for colorimetric LAMP detection
of bacteria.39 The limit of detection (LOD)
for S. aureus was estimated at about
200 CFU/mL. Colorimetric detection is simple, but the sensitivity
is not high, and it is challenging for quantitative analysis. Additionally,
a microfluidic electrochemical assay using on-chip LAMP has been reported
for rapid detection and quantitation of E. coli.40 It was demonstrated that the system
could detect and quantify 24 CFU/mL of E. coli in 60 min using a linear sweep voltammetry method.

Despite
the attractiveness of these on-chip LAMP systems for rapid
pathogen detection,31,38−41 there are multiple limitations
that impose restriction on their applications in low-resource settings.
(1) Some microfluidic devices require complicated fabrication procedures
because of microvalves and patterned electrodes used in those devices,38,41 which increase the device cost as well. (2) Complicated assay procedures
are also obstacles to point-of-care analysis in low-resource settings,
such as magnetic bead-based assays that require multiple steps for
bacterial cell lysis, DNA denaturization, DNA hybridization on beads,
and washing steps.41 Cassette-like devices
demand a significant amount of manual micropipetting because of the
lack of reagent delivery channels.39 (3)
Sensitivity is not very high (e.g., LODs of 270 DNA copies38 or 200 CFU/mL39),
especially for colorimetric detection.39 None of the aforementioned instrument-free detection systems has
achieved a LOD down to 3 DNA copies. (4) Most systems still rely on
fairly expensive and bulky detectors (e.g., potentiostats,40 spectrophotometers,31,41 and turbidimeters42) and other supporting
equipment (e.g., pumps41 and water baths31,38) that are not commonly available in resource-poor settings. Conventional
DNA extraction procedures that usually require the use of centrifuges
are also not suitable for limited-resource settings.40

As far as we know, no low-cost microfluidic POC devices
have been
reported for the rapid diagnosis of meningitis in low-resource settings.
Herein, we report a novel, versatile, and cost-effective PDMS/paper
hybrid microfluidic platform for the rapid, sensitive, and instrument-free
detection of the main meningitis-causing bacterium, Neisseria meningitidis. Chromatography paper used
in this hybrid system serves as a 3D substrate for the prestorage
of DNA primers for subsequent LAMP reactions to improve the detection
sensitivity. The detection of N. meningitidis is highly sensitive, with a limit of detection about 3 DNA copies.
To our best knowledge, this might be the lowest LOD from previously
reported on-chip LAMP systems for instrument-free pathogenic microorganism
detection. This hybrid microfluidic platform has versatile functions.
First, a rapid qualitative detection (i.e., giving a yes or no answer)
of N. meningitidis can be achieved
within 45 min without using any specialized instruments. Results can
be visualized by the naked eye. These features make the microfluidic
POC platform capable of quick preliminary diagnosis of meningitis
in the field or other resource-limited settings. Furthermore, on-chip
LAMP products can be readily collected for confirmatory diagnosis
or quantitative analysis of meningitis in a laboratory setting.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals and Materials
LAMP detection and DNA preparation:
The LAMP primers (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) for
the target ctrA gene sequence12 from Neisseria meningitidis are shown in Supporting Information Table S-1. Loopamp DNA amplification
kit and Loopamp fluorescence detection reagent (calcein) were purchased
from Eiken Co. Ltd., Japan. DNA isolation kit containing a lysis buffer
ATL and a ready-to-use proteinase K solution and LAMP product purification
kit were purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA).

Microfluidic
platform fabrication: Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard 184) was
obtained from Dow Corning (Midland, MI); Whatman#1 chromatography
paper and Epoxy glue were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and
ITW Devcon (Danvers, MA), respectively.

All other chemicals
were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and
used without further purification, unless stated otherwise. Unless
otherwise noted, all solutions were prepared with ultrapure Milli-Q
water (18.2 MΩ cm) from a Millipore Milli-Q system (Bedford,
MA).

Microfluidic Platform Design and Fabrication
As shown
in Figure 1, the microfluidic device comprises
three layers, two PDMS layers on the top of a glass slide. The top
layer is the PDMS layer used for reagent delivery, including three
microchannels (width 100 μm, depth 100 μm) on the bottom
side of the PDMS layer, and one inlet reservoir (diameter 1.0 mm,
depth 1.5 mm). The middle PDMS layer consists of 6 wells as LAMP zones
(diameter 2.0 mm), 3 outlet reservoirs (diameter 1.0 mm), and microchannels
(width 100 μm, depth 100 μm) at the bottom side of the
middle PDMS layer to connect to outlet reservoirs. The bottom layer
is a glass slide mainly for structure support. Different LAMP zones
were used for negative control (NC), positive control (PC), and N. meningitidis detection, respectively. Both omission
of LAMP primers and omission of DNA template for negative control
were tested and showed the same results. Thus, omission of LAMP primers
was adopted as the main negative control herein. PC template DNA and
its primer mix (PM) were provided by the Loopamp DNA amplification
kit.

A chromatography paper disk (diameter 2.0 mm) cut by a
laser cutter (Epilog Zing 16, Golden, CO) was placed inside each LAMP
zone, as a 3D storage substrate for LAMP primers.

LAMP primers. (b) A photograph of the hybrid microfluidic device for

zone illustrating the principle of the LAMP detection.

On-Chip LAMP Procedures
After the
LAMP mix was prepared
in a biosafety cabinet, the LAMP reaction mix was introduced to the
biochip from the inlet reservoir to fill different LAMP zones. After
the inlet and outlets reservoirs were sealed with Epoxy, the microfluidic
device was placed on a heating film at 63 °C for 45 min for LAMP
reactions, followed by the termination of LAMP reactions at 80 °C
for 2 min. The heating film was controlled by an inexpensive proportional–integral–derivative
(PID)-based temperature controller devised by our laboratory.

After LAMP reactions, a portable UV pen light was applied to shine
LAMP products. The generated fluorescence was captured by a cellular
phone camera (e.g., iPhone 5), and the images were processed with
the NIH software ImageJ. Results were further confirmed by a high-sensitivity
Nikon Ti-E fluorescence microscope (Melville, NY) that was equipped
with a motorized stage and a cooled CCD camera to measure the fluorescence
intensities, using appropriate FITC optical filters (Ex = 495 nm;
Em = 520 nm) for calcein and Cy3 optical filters (Ex = 550 nm; Em
= 570 nm) for Cy3-labeled primers.

Centrifuge-Free Detection
of Microorganisms
Artificial cerebrospinal
fluid (ACSF) was prepared according to
previously published protocol.43 Centrifuge-free
assay procedures for microorganisms in ACSF were as follows: First,
a couple of bacterial colonies were picked from a pure culture using
a sterile loop and solubilized in a 20 μL ACSF buffer to prepare
the pathogen/ACSF mixture. Next, 2 μL of this mixture was added
into 18 μL of bacterial lysis buffer that contained 50 mM Tris
buffer (pH 7.5), 4 M urea, and 0.1% triton, and incubated at room
temperature for 10 min. At last, 2 μL of the pathogen/pathogen
mixture lysate was used in the LAMP reaction mixture for on-chip LAMP
reaction, as performed in the aforementioned on-chip LAMP procedures.

Results and Discussion
PDMS/Paper Hybrid Microfluidic Device
Because different
chip substrates have their own advantages and limitations, we previously
developed a PDMS/paper hybrid microfluidic system for one-step pathogen
detection, in which paper facilitated the integration of graphene
oxide-based nanosensors on the chip.37 Although
this method can directly measure microorganisms without complicated
sample preparation due to the use of aptamers, the sensitivity is
generally not as high as DNA-amplification-based methods. In this
work, chromatography paper is placed in LAMP zones to form another
PDMS/paper hybrid microfluidic device (Figure 1), in which paper serves as the 3D substrate for preloading DNA primers
for subsequent LAMP reactions to improve detection sensitivity. Paper
is a highly porous material, which renders it as an ideal 3D storage
substrate for interaction-based assays.44 Paper’s 3D microstructures can also facilitate uniform reagent
distribution. It can be seen from Figure 2a
that when fluorescently labeled primers were initially loaded into
LAMP zones, primers were uniformly distributed in LAMP zones either
with paper or without paper inside. However, when devices were placed
in a vacuum desiccator to dry, a necessary step to make a ready-to-use
POC device in this work, primers in paper-free LAMP zones accumulated
on the edge of the LAMP zones, while primers in LAMP zones with paper
inside were still uniformly distributed (Figure 2b).

Figure 2 (a,b) Fluorescence images of preloaded Cy3-labeled primers (10.4
μM) in LAMP zones either with or without paper inside. When
LAMP zones were dry, primers in paper-free LAMP zones accumulated
on the edge of the LAMP zones, while primers in LAMP zones with paper
inside were still uniformly distributed. (c) On-chip LAMP performance
comparison between biochips with paper inside and without paper inside
over a period of 2 months. Nucleic acid concentration of N. meningitidis LAMP products from LAMP zones with
paper inside and without paper inside was measured to evaluate on-chip
LAMP performance between these two different kinds of biochips. DNA
concentration was normalized for convenient comparison.

In addition, we also investigated and compared
the on-chip LAMP
performance of the devices with paper inside and without paper inside
over a period of 2 months at room temperature, as shown in Figure 2c. We precoated LAMP primers of N.
meningitidis in LAMP zones with paper inside or without
paper inside. The two kinds of ready-to-use microfluidic chips were
stored at the same conditions in dark. LAMP reactions were performed
within 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks, respectively. LAMP products were quantified
by using Nanodrop after each LAMP reaction to evaluate the on-chip
LAMP performance. As shown in Figure 2c, the
nucleic acid concentration of LAMP product from LAMP zones without
paper inside kept decreasing through the whole experimental period.
A sharp decrease within the first 2 weeks was observed. At week 8,
the on-chip LAMP performance decreased by ∼40%, which implied
that the devices without paper inside were not able to provide consistent
results over a period of time. Such devices without paper inside needed
to be used right away. On the contrary, the on-chip LAMP performance
from the device with paper inside remained stable within 2 months.
Only a slight decrease (less than 6%) over time was observed. Therefore,
we concluded that the introduction of paper in this hybrid microfluidic
biochip as a primer storage substrate also enabled stable on-chip
LAMP performance and longer shelf life than those without paper inside.
This is mainly because (1) highly interwoven paper fibers can provide
DNA primers a 3D protection matrix from harsh environmental elements,
and thus are commonly used to collect samples for forensic DNA analysis.45,46 (2) DNA primers can be physically adsorbed onto paper fibers, avoiding
DNA loss in the air in the form of aerosols.

On-Chip LAMP Detection
of N. meningitidis Using Purified DNA
To offer high-sensitivity detection,
DNA amplification is usually required. Although PCR is the most commonly
used DNA amplification method, it requires a carefully controlled
sequence of heating and cooling cyclers. The fabrication of heaters
and temperature sensors on a chip is complicated.47 In contrast, the LAMP method that utilizes the Bacillus stearothermophilus DNA polymerase, a thermally
stable enzyme with high strand displacement ability over the template–primer
complex,48,49 is a simple, rapid, specific, and cost-effective
nucleic acid amplification method when compared to PCR.50 This isothermal LAMP DNA amplification technique
allows nucleic acid amplification to be carried out under thermally
constant conditions, eliminating the use of expensive instrumentation
(e.g., thermal cyclers) for stringent thermal cycling as in conventional
PCR, or complicated and costly microfabrication of heating elements
on a chip for on-chip PCR.47

The
feasibility of the PDMS/paper hybrid microfluidic platform for N. meningitidis detection was first tested by using
purified DNA of N. meningitidis. The N. meningitidis DNA template was isolated and purified
from bacterial culture.

A 26 μL LAMP reaction mix was
introduced through the inlet
reservoir into different sample test, positive control (PC), and negative
control (NC) LAMP zones, where the specific LAMP primers for the target N. meningitidis and PC DNA were preloaded, respectively.
A notable feature of the device design is that the LAMP reaction wells
in the middle PDMS layer were independent without connections in the
same layer, which can effectively prevent cross-talk among the sample
test, PC, and NC LAMP zones during the LAMP reactions.

During
the LAMP amplification process, it was observed that a magnesium
pyrophosphate precipitate was formed as a turbid byproduct of the
nucleic acid amplification process.51 This
precipitate forms only when the targeted DNA is present in the LAMP
amplification process, such that the presence of the pyrophosphate
can serve as an indicator of the presence of a pathogen’s target
DNA by turbidity detection. Turbidity however is challenging for high-sensitivity
visual detection. Thus, turbidity detection usually requires a turbidimeter.42 Actually, visual confirmation by the naked eye
can be achieved by the addition of a mixture of calcein in the presence
of manganese ions. The fluorescence of calcein is quenched by manganese
ions before LAMP amplification. When the amplification reaction proceeds,
the manganese–calcein complex is deprived of manganese ions
by generated pyrophosphate, which results in the emission of fluorescence
under UV light (Figure 1c).50 As such, clinical diagnosis of the pathogen N. meningitidis can be achieved by visual confirmation
of the green color with a portable UV light pen, as shown in Figure 3. The fluorescence generated was captured by a cellular
phone camera, as used in Figure 3a. It was
observed that the N. meningitidis sample
and PC showed bright green fluorescence under a portable UV light
pen, while NC only showed weak background. To quantify the difference
of the fluorescence between N. meningitidis and NC, the gray value, an indication of the brightness of a pixel,
of fluorescence images was processed by the software ImageJ, as shown
in Figure 3c. The cutoff value was determined
as 3-fold standard deviations of the mean gray value of the negative
controls on the basis of the negative control. Figure 3c clearly shows the difference between NC and PC and N. meningitidis.

The results were further confirmed
by high-sensitivity fluorescence
microscopy (see Figure 3b and d). Similar to
that observed in Figure 3a, strong fluorescence
was observed in N. meningitidis and
PC LAMP zones, but not in NC zones. The fluorescence intensity of
the N. meningitidis LAMP products was
about 6 times higher than that of the NC.

Figure 3 On-chip LAMP detection
of N. meningitidis using purified DNA
by a portable UV light pen (a) and fluorescence
microscopy (b). Strong fluorescence was observed in N. meningitidis and PC LAMP zones, but not in NC
zones. (c) Gray value of the LAMP products measured by ImageJ; (d)
fluorescent intensity of the LAMP products measured by fluorescence
microscope. The purified DNA template used was 3 × 106 copies per LAMP zone.

Besides, the multiple-layer biochip is designed in a way
to render
versatile functions for the N. meningitidis diagnosis. In addition to on-chip LAMP detection, different LAMP
products can be collected separately for further confirmatory tests
using conventional gel electrophoresis and quantitative analysis,
as demonstrated in Supporting Information Figures S-1 and 6 in laboratory settings, respectively. When the
NC LAMP mix and the N. meningitidis LAMP mix in two PCR tubes were placed under UV light before LAMP
reactions, neither tube showed notable fluorescence (Supporting Information Figure S-1a). However, after on-chip
LAMP reaction, similar to on-chip visual detection as shown in Figure 3a, the collected N. meningitidis LAMP products in a PCR tube showed bright green fluorescence under
portable UV light (Supporting Information Figure S-1b). Conversely, the NC mixture had no difference after
LAMP reaction. The obvious difference between N. meningitidis tests and NC could be seen even by the naked eye. Subsequently,
the results were further confirmed by conventional gel electrophoresis
of extracted LAMP products, as shown in Supporting
Information Figure S-1c, the comparison of LAMP products in
lane 2 with the DNA sizing ladder in lane 1 verified the success of
the on-chip LAMP. As expected, no DNA bands were observed in NC in
lane 3.

Specificity Test
As reported previously, LAMP is a
reliable method for pathogen diagnosis with high specificity.52,53 We tested the specificity of our method among N.
meningitidis, Giardia lamblia (Giardia), and Bordetella
pertussis (B. pertussis) (data not shown), and among three common types of meningitis-causing
bacteria, N. meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) (See Figure 4). Both tests showed high specificity of our approach. For instance,
signals from LAMP zones with H. influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) DNA templates were observed to be
similar to NC in Figure 4, in contrast to bright
fluorescence from N. meningitidis,
which confirmed the high specificity of our approach in the detection
of N. meningitidis.

signal, whereas LAMP zones loaded with H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae template DNA showed
signal similar to that of NC. (c) Gel electrophoresis of the on-chip

Instrument-Free Detection
of Pathogenic Microorganisms
The detection discussed above
was carried out by using a purified
DNA template. There have also been reports on rapid PCR detection
for clinic samples of pathogenic bacteria by using special lysis reagents
without the inhibition of PCR.47,54−57 Yet for LAMP DNA amplification, traditional sample preparation procedures
such as DNA isolation and purification are needed.12,13 These procedures are time-consuming, and require the use of centrifuges
that however usually do not exist in the field, making them not suitable
for POC detection in resource-poor settings.

In this work, we
have developed a simple microfluidic approach for pathogenic microorganism
detection (not just pathogen DNA). This approach combines a simple
bacteria lysis procedure with on-chip LAMP detection, without using
any centrifuge and prepurified DNA templates. Because the examination
of cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) is a cornerstone of current meningitis
diagnosis, we spiked N. meningitidis bacteria in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) to mimic the real
clinic samples for on-chip LAMP detection.

on-chip LAMP products of N. meningitidis in ACSF. Lanes 1–3: 100 bp marker; LAMP products of N. meningitidis in ACSF; NC.

The first step is to discover a simple method to lysis N. meningitidis microorganisms in a resource-limited
setting. More importantly, the method should be fully compatible to
the subsequent LAMP reactions (i.e., without inhibition to LAMP reactions).
We tried various lysis buffers including some common commercial buffers
used for PCR (e.g., Buffet ATL from Qiagen, MagNA Pure Bacteria Lysis
Buffer from Roche Applied Science), but found only this lysis buffer
(50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5), 4 M urea, and 0.1% triton) is compatible
to LAMP reactions, while others completely inhibited LAMP reaction
(see gel electrophoresis results in Figure S-2 of the Supporting Information). This lysis buffer can
be adapted for other microorganism detection using LAMP without problems
of inhibition.

Upon the success of microorganism lysis without
the use of any
centrifuges, the lysate without any further preparation was used directly
for the on-chip LAMP detection of N. meningitidis microorganisms in ACSF. The results in Figure 5 showed that the LAMP products of the spiked ACSF sample could still
produce strong fluorescence as purified DNA samples under portable
UV light and fluorescence microscope. Figure 5c and d showed good discrimination among a spiked N. meningitidis sample, PC, and NC. Gel electrophoresis
of on-chip LAMP products from pathogen/ACSF sample further confirmed
the success of the LAMP reaction (Figure 5e),
and the successful detection of N. meningitidis.

The instrument-free pathogen detection was very simple and
fully
compatible with LAMP reactions, without using any equipment. The success
of this instrument-free LAMP detection using the microfluidic device
is significant because it indicates that real samples could be directly
used for the on-chip LAMP reaction without any laborious and time-consuming
DNA isolation or purification procedures.

Calibration Curve
The visual LAMP fluorescence detection
is a simple method for rapid pathogen detection, from which a yes
or no qualitative answer for POC detection can be achieved quickly
based on the fluorescence of the LAMP products. During our experiments,
it was found that the fluorescence intensity was not directly proportional
to pathogen concentrations, indicating the fluorescence intensity
of calcein is not suitable for quantitative analysis. Although the
qualitative analysis was sufficient for most diseases diagnosis, we
developed an indirect method for quantitative analysis of N. meningitidis, based on the versatile functions
of the microfluidic chip. Before on-chip LAMP reactions, the DNA concentrations
of a series of 10-fold diluted pathogen/ACSF lysate solutions ranging
from 6 × 106 to 6 were quantified to obtain initial
DNA copy numbers per LAMP zone by Nanodrop. After LAMP amplifications
in the microfluidic platform, because microwells for samples PC and
NC were separated from each other in the middle PDMS layer, LAMP products
could be simply collected, purified, and quantified. Thus, the calibration
was generated by plotting the DNA LAMP product concentration against
initial DNA copy numbers, as shown in Figure 6. It can be seen that the product DNA concentration is directly proportional
to the log of the initial template DNA numbers, with an R2 of 0.98. Therefore, by measuring the nucleic acid concentration
of the LAMP products from unknown N. meningitidis samples, we can calculate the amount of the bacteria in unknown
samples, and thus estimate the seriousness of infection.

Figure 6 Calibration
curve of nucleic acid concentration of the LAMP products
(after LAMP amplification) versus the initial copy number of template
DNA (before LAMP amplification) of N. meningitidis in ACSF.

Limit of Detection (LOD)
By using a series of 10-fold
diluted N. meningitidis DNA template
solutions whose DNA copy numbers were determined by Nanodrop, the
limit of detection was studied. The top left LAMP zones of the device
were used for NC. All other LAMP zones were used for N. meningitidis DNA detection. The initial DNA copy
numbers of the template (before LAMP) ranged from 3 × 106, 3 × 105, 3 × 104, ... to
3 × 10–2 per LAMP zone. After LAMP reactions,
it was observed from Figure 7a that even the
initial DNA templates were as low as 3 copies per LAMP zone; the on-chip
LAMP products still exhibited strong fluorescence. However, when the
initial DNA templates were less than one copy, the fluorescence of
the LAMP zones was as dim as the NC. On the basis of 3-fold standard
deviations of the mean gray value of the negative controls on the
basis of the negative control, we calculated the gray value of the
cutoff line for N. meningitidis as
21.5, as shown with the dashed line in Figure 7b. The gray value of the LAMP product from 3 copies of initial DNA
template was much higher than that of the cutoff line. This was further
confirmed by off-chip gel electrophoresis of all LAMP products, as
shown in Figure 7c. Therefore, the LOD of the
microfluidic approach was estimated to be ∼3 DNA copies (or
7.4 fg), which is close to single-bacterium detection sensitivity.
This LOD was even 3-fold as low as that of the conventional real-time
PCR method for N. meningitidis detection
(9 copies/reaction).58

Conclusion
We have developed a versatile PDMS/paper
hybrid microfluidic platform
for rapid and sensitive detection of N. meningitidis. Because of the integrated LAMP DNA amplification on the chip, the
limit of detection of ∼3 DNA copies of N. meningitidis has been achieved within 45 min, overcoming lengthy assay time and
low-sensitivity issues in conventional methods for the diagnosis of
meningitis. This hybrid microfluidic platform incorporates the advantages
of high performance in liquid control from PDMS and of high porosity
from paper for preloading LAMP primers.

The function of this
hybrid microfluidic system is versatile. (1)
Its on-chip LAMP detection based on calcein under portable UV light
does not require any bulky specialized equipment without the use of
any centrifuges and cumbersome procedures for DNA isolation and purification.
The instrument-free detection makes the microfluidic system highly
capable for the diagnosis of meningitis in the field or in other resource-limited
settings. (2) The design of the microfluidic biochip allows on-chip
LAMP products to be readily extracted for more confirmatory tests
(e.g., gel electrophoresis) and quantitative analysis based on the
calibration curve, as demonstrated in this work. This feature is suitable
to the in-depth analysis and study of patient samples in clinical
laboratory settings. Combining features (1) and (2) can provide a
comprehensive examination of patient samples in different settings.
For instance, after an initial qualitative assay of a patient sample
in the field or resource-limited settings, the sample tested by the
biochip can be sent back to a clinical laboratory for further confirmatory
tests or quantitative analysis to examine the disease seriousness
of infection. Moreover, by designing and changing different primers
specific to other infectious diseases, this microfluidic platform
can have great potential in quick and early diagnosis of a broad range
of other infectious diseases, such as whooping cough, malaria, H1N1,
and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), especially for developing
nations. By scaling up channels and LAMP zones, our method can be
used for high-throughput screening of different infectious diseases.
