Ionic
liquids (ILs) are proposed as simple and efficient test materials
to evaluate the performance of energy dispersive X-ray spectrometers
(EDS) in the low energy range below 1 keV. By only one measurement,
C Kα, N Kα, O Kα, and F Kα X-ray lines can
be excited. Additionally, the S Kα line at 2.3 keV and, particularly,
the S L series at 149 eV complete the picture with X-ray lines offered
by the selected ILs. The well-known (certifiable) elemental composition
of the ILs selected in the present study can be used to check the
accuracy of results produced with the available EDS quantification
routines in the low energy range, simultaneously, for several low
atomic number elements. A comparison with other reference materials
in use for testing the performance of EDS in the low energy range
is included.

==== Body
Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometers
(EDS) constitute one of the analytical tools mostly employed for quick
analysis of the elemental composition of solid samples. The excitation
of the characteristic X-rays can be induced by electrons, as is the
case in a scanning electron microscope (SEM), or by X-rays coming
from an X-ray tube. Both respective techniques, electron probe microanalysis
(EPMA) and X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF), in their version with
EDS detection, i.e., ED-EPMA and ED-XRF, are able to provide accurate
qualitative and quantitative results. Unlike conventional XRF,1 in the soft X-ray energy range below 1 keV, state-of-the-art
ED-EPMA is able to identify elements of low atomic number down to
Beryllium (Be Kα: 108.8 eV) with high sensitivity.2 The reason for this lies in the use of high-transmission,
thin polymer windows protecting the EDS detector. The newest implementation
of silicon nitride windows to EDS detectors further improves the light
element sensitivity.3 Hence, even the detection
of X-ray lines below 100 eV, including Li K line at 54 eV, becomes
possible without necessity to renounce to the detector window. Current
developments of detector windows based on graphenic carbon enable
detection below 100 eV as well.4

The progress leading to higher EDS efficiency, particularly in
the low-energy range, is being accompanied by technological developments
in the detector manufacturing process as well as in the counting electronics.
The energy resolution of a state-of-the-art EDS already approaches
the theoretical limits.

Beyond all these recent, impressive
developments with the hardware
of EDS systems, one has to steadily evaluate the accuracy of the analytical
result produced with the new EDS instruments, particularly when using
X-ray lines in the low energy range. Recently, a systematic study
on “light” compounds such as borides, carbides, nitrides,
oxides, and fluorides has proven that the application of a traditional
quantification model to X-ray lines below 1 keV measured with the
new silicon drift detector (SDD) EDS systems works satisfactory; i.e.,
an accuracy below 5%-rel. can be attained.5 However, when “standardless” ED-EPMA quantification
is applied, such accuracies are too optimistic. Successful standardless
quantitative analysis needs accurate knowledge of the performance
parameters of the EDS system, such as EDS efficiency, its behavior
with respect to pile-up effects or artifacts like incomplete charge
collection (ICC) for the very low energy range. A minimum of control of the performance parameters of an EDS spectrometer
can be ensured by applying the recommendations given in the international
standard ISO 15632 “Microbeam analysis - selected instrumental
performance parameters for the specification and checking of energy
dispersive X-ray spectrometers for use in electron probe microanalysis”.6 In this document, it is specified
how the calibration state of the energy scale, the energy resolution,
and the L/K intensity ratio of copper or nickel as a measure for the
spectrometer efficiency shall be evaluated. A case study on checking
various EDS systems according to a procedure and a dedicated test
material in line with the ISO 15632 standard is described in ref (7). An overview with the main
instrumental EDS parameters to be checked, including test materials
mostly used for calibration purposes, was given recently in ref (8). Therein, regarding the
EDS performance check at energies below 1 keV, a new test material
(EDS-TM003) in form of a B–C–N–O thick layer,
constituted from individual alternating B–C and C–N–O
ultrathin sublayers, deposited on Si(100) wafer as substrate is highlighted.
The considerable manufacturing effort and related high costs associated
with this material motivated us to look for further alternative options.
Otherwise, the availability of reference materials containing mainly
(or exclusively) light elements with certified composition is very
scarce. Ref (5) gives
a good overview on potential reference materials containing light
elements such as stoichiometric or mineral compounds. In the past,
our lab has spent considerable effort in preparing candidates reference
materials containing light elements tailored for various analytical
methods.9,10

The present paper proposes a class
of material that is able to
offer a set of several Kα X-ray lines below 1 keV in one measurement,
as a suitable certified reference material (CRM) candidate to be applied
for the quick and accurate evaluation of EDS performance in the low
energy range. The promising reference material with properties like
excellent spatial homogeneity, stability, well-known and also variable
elemental composition, easy accessibility, low costs, etc., is the
class of ionic liquids (ILs).11 They are
in principle molten salts with a melting point below 100 °C and
a very low vapor pressure (<0.01 Pa at around 440 K for the ILs
in this contribution).12 The cation is
organic, whereas the anion can be organic or inorganic. While ionic
liquids have attracted the interests of chemists and physicists in
various field of research and development, their use as a reference
material has been proposed13,14 and the only activity
so far was to successfully test them as a reference material for quantitative
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).15

Experimental Section
Ionic Liquids
Ionic liquids either
were purchased from
IoLiTec Ionic Liquids Technologies GmbH (Heilbronn, Germany) in the
highest available grade or were a donation from AC2T research
GmbH (Wiener Neustadt, Austria). Small amounts of the ionic liquid
were bottled into small vials and dried and stored for degassing in
vacuum at 10–6 to 10–7 mbar. Samples
were prepared to exhibit a flat surface by filling up a 0.2 mm deep
cavity of 2 mm diameter in a customized SEM sample holder of 1.2210/115CrV3
steel and immediately transferred into the SEM chamber; see graphical
abstract figure.

Safety Considerations
According
to EC regulation,16 the used ILs are classified
as follows: acute
oral and dermal toxicity, skin corrosion, and chronic aquatic toxicity
and dangerous to the environment. Considering the very low sample
amount (approximately 2 μL) and careful handling, no harm or
health risks are expected.

SEM/EDS
Three EDS spectrometers
have been tested with
the newly proposed material: (i) an SDD EDS of type XFlash (Bruker
Nano GmbH, Berlin, Germany), (ii) an SDD EDS of type UltraDry (Thermo
Scientific, U.S.A.), and (iii) a Si(Li) EDS (EDAX, U.S.A.). All X-ray
spectra have been taken at 3 kV beam voltage and at a takeoff angle
of 35°.

Results and Discussion
For the testing
of EDS performance in the low energy range, the
1,3-alkylimidazolium ionic liquid class with the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide
counterion (Figure 1) was chosen, since it offers several, well separated and well balanced
intensities of Kα X-ray lines below 1 keV: C Kα, N Kα,
O Kα, and F Kα. Additionally, the S Kα line at 2.3
keV and particularly the S L series at 149 eV can also be taken into
account for testing the EDS performance. The ionic liquid sample can
be easily prepared to exhibit a flat surface by filling a small cavity
in a conventional SEM stainless steel sample holder. This preparation
ensures the application as a neat, homogeneous bulk sample thick enough
to avoid any excitation of elements from the sample holder. The ionic
liquids used in this study are sufficiently conductive so that no
additional efforts are necessary to make the surface conductive. A
high chemical stability at elevated temperatures without detectable
decomposition for the proposed ILs is reported17 and is ensured by the chosen storing conditions (room temperature,
in vacuum, absence of light; also see the corresponding material safety
data sheets). A slight enrichment of the [NTf2] anion and
longer alkyl side chains might be possible in the very near surface
(a few nanometers).18,19 However, this surface effect
has no significant consequences on the purpose of the low-energy EDS
test material as proposed here.

Figure 1 Structures of the ionic liquids used in
the present study.

X-ray spectra of ionic
liquids excited at 3 kV together with a
representative SEM micrograph are shown in Figure 2a. The spectra were normalized to the integral
Bremsstrahlung intensity within the energy range from 0.9 to 1.1 keV.
It can be clearly seen that the X-ray peaks (all Kα lines) are
separated from each other and well balanced in intensities. Furthermore,
the relative elemental peak intensities vary as expected upon changing
the stoichiometry of the ionic liquid, i.e., increasing the relative
amount of carbon by variation of the side chain length of the ionic
liquid. The SEM micrograph shows a nontextured surface demonstrating
excellent lateral homogeneity. In-depth homogeneity at a depth of
>1 nm was reported for the proposed IL class.15,19−21

test materials, together with an exemplary SEM micrograph of the IL

Overlap of X-ray spectra of two candidate test materials for the energy
range below 1 keV: the ionic liquid [C1C1im][NTf2] and EDS-TM003,8 measured under
identical conditions (3 kV excitation, same geometry and detector).

If we compare the X-ray spectrum
of an ionic liquid candidate test
material with that of the recently proposed EDS-TM003,8 see Figure 2b, it can be concluded that the selected ILs are competitive for
the evaluation of the EDS performance by means of the interference-free
lines available below 1 keV. Additionally, the proposed ILs offer
a well-separated F K line at 677 eV as well as the S L series at 149
eV for a regular performance check. The X-ray line of lowest energy
at which EDS-TM003 emits is the B K line at 184 eV. Boron is an element
not present in the ILs selected in the present study, but the element
can be easily incorporated either by introducing a boron containing
functional group on the cation or by changing the anion to a boron
containing anion (e.g., tetraphenylborate, tetrafluoroborate). As
already pointed out in the introduction, the
idea behind the consideration of ILs as an EDS test material for the
low energy range is to find a suitable material as effective as the
EDS-TM003 sample, however, having associated considerably less manufacturing
effort and production costs.

In order to demonstrate the capabilities
of the new test material(s),
a set of three EDS systems have been tested with regard to their low-energy
performance. Two of the EDS systems tested are of the SDD type with
a detector area of 10 and 100 mm2, respectively. The third
EDS has a 10 mm2 Si(Li) detector. The corresponding X-ray
spectra of one ionic liquid test material measured with the three
EDS systems under comparable conditions are presented in Figure 3. The spectra have
been normalized to the maximum intensity of the F K line. Several
EDS instrumental parameters and performance results determined for
the energy range below 1 keV can be easily recognized from this comparison:
(i) The calibration state of the energy scale of the two SDD systems
in the range below 1 keV is acceptable; i.e., the energy shifts are
below 10 eV, as proposed in ref (7) for other energies. The energy scale for the Si(Li) EDS
was not properly calibrated. Significant peak (negative) shifts of
about 10 eV are visible for the position of the N K and C K lines.
(ii) The energy resolution, expressed as the full-width-at-half-maximum,
of the SDD EDS system with 10 mm2 detector area is superior
to that of the other two EDS systems. With lower energies, the energy
resolution of the Si(Li) EDS worsens in comparison to that of the
SDD 100 mm2 system. Such a broadened C K peak measured
by this EDS is typical for ICC.22 (iii)
The heights of the C K, N K, O K, and F K peaks obtained with the
three EDS systems are quite similar, pointing to rather similar spectrometer
efficiencies. This was expected since the detector windows of all
three EDS detectors employed were of the same type (Moxtek AP3.3).
Care must be taken when the EDS efficiency is quantitatively evaluated:
the peak height is affected by the spectrometer efficiency but also
by the energy resolution. Moreover, the ICC effect may occur for C
K, so that an additional, asymmetric broadening of the C K peak accompanies
the significant shift of the peak to smaller energies. A physical
background subtraction for an accurate evaluation of the net peak
areas is challenging and at this stage unnecessary when the task is
to qualitatively asses the low-energy EDS performance, i.e., either
by comparing spectra of two different systems (as in Figure 3) or by comparing spectra taken
with the same EDS system at regular intervals. (iv) The ability to
detect the S-L series at about 149 eV is featured only by the 10 mm2 SDD EDS, whereas in the case of the 100 mm2 SDD,
the S-L series is barely visible and not detectable at all by the
Si(Li) detector. For those EDS systems able to detect S L series,
the evaluation of the intensity ratio of the lines S L at 149 eV and
S Kα at 2.307 keV can be considered as a quantitative measure
for the spectrometer efficiency at low energies. It can be expected
that future EDS systems will be able to detect X-rays below 200 eV
with increased sensitivity. (v) It is interesting to note that the
normalized spectrum in the case of the Si(Li) detector shows a higher
intensity in the C K line than it would be expected from the trend
seen in the case of the SDDs with the same type of detector window
(Figure 3). As noticed
already in (ii), the significantly increased width of the C K peak
shifted to a lower energy indicates ICC effect rather than contamination
of the Si(Li) detector.

Figure 3 Comparison of X-ray spectra of the IL candidate
test material [C1C1im][NTf2] recorded
with three different
EDS systems under otherwise equal conditions. Without it being necessary
to quantitatively evaluate the spectra, note the following results:
(i) similar intensity ratios of the C K, N K, and O K to the F K line,
(ii) best energy resolution for the SDD EDS system with 10 mm2 detector area, and (iii) best capability to detect the S
L series at 149 eV in favor of the 10 mm2 SDD EDS system.

It has been shown that the present
selection of ILs is suitable
as candidate materials for testing the EDS performance. To formally
develop them as a certified reference material, additional tests,
such as stability and homogeneity,23 will
be carried out according to ISO Guide 35:2006 Reference materials
- General and statistical principles for certification.24 Beam-induced specimen damage could not be observed
in the present proof-of-principle study, performed at moderate conditions
(3 kV accelerating voltage, probe currents below 1 nA, and acquisition
times of a few minutes). However, beam-induced sample damage cannot
be excluded at harder conditions. Stability tests to be carried out
for certification purposes according to ISO Guide 3524 will define thresholds for electron probe doses at which
the ILs might suffer damage and X-ray spectra may change. They will
be specified in the certification report.

Conclusions and Outlook
The possibility of using ionic liquids as reference material for
testing the EDS performance in the energy range below 1 keV was investigated,
and the proof-of-concept was successful. Several instrumental parameters,
such as the energy scale, energy resolution, and spectrometer efficiency
can be checked with only one measurement of the proposed ionic liquid
test material. Either the periodical check of the EDS spectrometer
in the low energy range can be efficiently performed by simply comparing
the spectra taken over a large time scale or the low-energy performance
of different EDS systems can be quickly evaluated qualitatively by
comparing spectra of the same ionic liquid test material measured
under the same experimental conditions.

The big advantage of
the IL based test materials is the possibility
for a quick check of several instrumental parameters of the EDS system
in the delicate low energy range. Additionally, having such samples
characterized by constant lateral and in-depth stoichiometry of light
elements in the sampling volume, a quite plane surface, it is possible
to validate matrix correction models for quantification in the energy
range below 1 keV. This can be carried out as part of a quick test
procedure to be applied in any service laboratory or as a more systematic
study on various sets of classes of ILs with certified elemental composition.
For the latter approach, a well-known EDS system is necessary, at
best a calibrated system as those reported in refs (8 and 25). This would also enable re-evaluation
of fundamental parameters of low atomic number elements as provided
by older atomic databases (e.g., mass attenuation coefficient, fluorescence
yield, ω, etc.). It is planned to certify the elemental composition
of selected ionic liquid test materials by, e.g., combustion analysis.
