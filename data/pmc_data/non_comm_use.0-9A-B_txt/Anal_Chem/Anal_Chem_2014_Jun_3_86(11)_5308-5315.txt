We propose a novel statistical approach
to improve the reliability
of 1H NMR spectral analysis in complex metabolic studies.
The Statistical HOmogeneous Cluster SpectroscopY (SHOCSY) algorithm
aims to reduce the variation within biological classes by selecting
subsets of homogeneous 1H NMR spectra that contain specific
spectroscopic metabolic signatures related to each biological class
in a study. In SHOCSY, we used a clustering method to categorize the
whole data set into a number of clusters of samples with each cluster
showing a similar spectral feature and hence biochemical composition,
and we then used an enrichment test to identify the associations between
the clusters and the biological classes in the data set. We evaluated
the performance of the SHOCSY algorithm using a simulated 1H NMR data set to emulate renal tubule toxicity and further exemplified
this method with a 1H NMR spectroscopic study of hydrazine-induced
liver toxicity study in rats. The SHOCSY algorithm improved the predictive
ability of the orthogonal partial least-squares discriminatory analysis
(OPLS-DA) model through the use of “truly” representative
samples in each biological class (i.e., homogeneous subsets). This
method ensures that the analyses are no longer confounded by idiosyncratic
responders and thus improves the reliability of biomarker extraction.
SHOCSY is a useful tool for removing irrelevant variation that interfere
with the interpretation and predictive ability of models and has widespread
applicability to other spectroscopic data, as well as other “omics”
type of data.

==== Body
Nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR)1 and/or mass spectroscopy
(MS)2,3 based
metabolic profiling studies are usually analyzed by multivariate statistical
methods that have been developed to identify specific metabolic signatures
contributing to different biological classes within a data set such
as disease versus healthy. Typically, unsupervised approaches such
as principal component analysis (PCA)4 are
used for identifying outliers and detecting analytical variation/drift
within data sets. The PCA scores plot indicates similarities/dissimilarities
between samples, and the loadings plot identifies the metabolites
that contribute most to the clustering pattern. Subsequently, supervised
algorithms such as orthogonal partial least square discrimination
analysis (OPLS-DA)5 are then applied to
optimize the classification and extract potential biomarkers for each
class. To assess the OPLS-DA model and to prevent overfitting, 7-fold
cross validation and permutation testing are often used. The 7-fold
cross-validation Q2 statistic is calculated by leaving
every seventh sample out and predicting them back in the model; thus,
Q2 measures the similarity between the predicted data and
the real data. Permutation tests randomly assign samples to classes
and recalculate the model: the random reassignments of samples to
classes are repeated for a large number of times in order to ascertain
the likelihood of the actual results being obtained by chance. As
a rule of thumb, the closer the Q2 value is to 1, the better
the predictive ability of the OPLS-DA model, and the model actual
Q2 value should be significantly higher than the Q2 obtained by permutation test.

Although there are numerous
examples of successful applications
of OPLS-DA1,2,6 and related
techniques for metabonomic data sets,7 the
complexity of biological data, particularly for human studies with
multiple sources of environmental and genetic variation, can compromise
the analysis. Similarly, for animal studies, the diversity of response
to stimuli may vary even when studies are carried out in a highly
homogeneous environment and in animals of the same genetic strain.
Recent publications have demonstrated considerable variation in responses
to drug treatment in both animal8,9 and human10,11 studies. Some individuals have been shown to be more susceptible
to drug toxicity8 and some respond better
or more quickly to drug treatment than others.12 This phenomenon prompted the evolution of pharmacometabonomics:8 the prediction of response to an intervention
based on their predose metabolic profiles.10,13 In these scenarios, OPLS-DA modeling may generate suboptimal results,
as the samples in each class are usually assumed to be homogeneous.

One method of addressing inhomogeneity is to use autoclustering
methods such as K-means,14 self-organizing
mapping (SOP),15 and nearest-neighbor clustering,16 where these approaches group the samples based
on their similarity. Although these methods have been employed in
“omics” studies,17−22 two issues are yet to be rectified: first, clusters of homogeneous
samples may not be relevant to the biological question of interest;
and second, the identity of each cluster, which may constitute the
homogeneous core of a biological class, is not specifically determined
by the clustering algorithm. Moreover, the clustering methods applied
previously in metabonomics studies were mainly used to aid the extraction
of metabolic information and to identify molecules of interest with
regard to defining a particular condition. For example, Robinette
et al.23 developed CLuster Analysis Statistical
SpectroscopY (CLASSY), which aims to cluster the peaks from the same
molecule by the correlation of the spectroscopic variables, whereas
Blaise et al.24 used the ratio of covariance
and correlation of the variables to achieve it. Statistical TOtal
Correlation SpectroscopY (STOCSY)25 has
been used to recover structural metabolic information, and its extension,
SubseT Optimization by Reference Matching (STORM),26 utilizes an iterative selection of homogeneous subsets
of spectra to improve structural elucidation by reducing variation
across inhomogeneous spectral data sets.

Here we adopt a similar
principle to STORM in combination with
OPLS-DA and an enrichment test to address the issues associated with
the autoclustering methods stated above to reduce the variation of
the data set and enhance robust biomarkers selection. In our proposed
algorithm, Statistical HOmogeneous Cluster SpectroscopY (SHOCSY),
OPLS-DA is first applied to identify the potential common spectral
features related to different biological classes of interest. We then
employ the K-means clustering approach to cluster the spectra based
on the potential discriminatory biomarkers. This ensures the K-means
clusters have similar metabolic features to the biological classes.
An enrichment test27−29 that evaluates which biological class is over-represented
in each K-means cluster is then employed. The enrichment test thus
associates clusters to specific biological classes and identifies
the samples that constitute homogeneous cores for the specific biological
class. The whole procedure is performed iteratively, and in each iteration,
a new set of common spectral features are obtained. This enables identification
of the “true” metabolic characteristics representative
of each biological class within the data set to be uncovered. The
algorithm converges when the cross-validation Q230 of the OPLS-DA model based on the homogeneous
representatives of biological classes is maximal. An OPLS-DA model
based on these core homogeneous subsets, without spectra contributing
idiosyncratic responses, will have an improved predictive ability
and potentially a more robust selection of biomarkers.

Initially,
we evaluate the SHOCSY algorithm using a simulated 1H NMR
spectral data set and then exemplify the method using
a rodent hepatoxicology study, in which treated animals were known
to show variable degrees of response.31

MATERIALS AND DATA ANALYSIS
Simulated NMR Spectra
We used simulated
NMR spectra
designed to emulate Paraquat toxicity, reflecting damage to the renal
proximal tubules. To evaluate our algorithm, we generated a total
of 12 data sets with different sizes (N = 30, 100,
and 500 spectra in each biological class) and different proportions
of idiosyncratic responders. Compared to the control class, the Paraquat
toxicity spectra were designed with increased signals intensity for
lactate (δ 1.32, doublet (d), δ 4.10, quartet (q)), and l-alanine (δ 1.46, d, δ 3.76, q) and reduced signal
intensities for creatinine (δ 3.03, singlet (s), δ 4.05,
s) and citrate (δ 2.53, d, δ 2.65, d). To introduce variable
responses within the Paraquat toxicity class, 5%, 10%, 33.3%, and
50% spectra within the Paraquat toxicity class were designed to mimic
resistance to the poisoning intervention. This was achieved by setting
the intensities of the above four biomarkers to similar intensities
to those in the control class. In addition, we also simulated metabolic
variation across the whole data set that was irrelevant to the response
to Paraquat toxicity. Variation was introduced in the intensities
of signals relating to hippurate (δ 3.96, d, δ 7.54, triplet
(t), δ 7.62, t, δ 7.82, double doublet (dd)), glycine
(δ 3.54, s), trimethylamine-N-oxide (δ
3.25, s), l-histidine (δ 3.16, dd, δ 3.23, dd,
δ 3.98, dd, δ 7.09, d, δ 7.90, d), and phenylacetylglutamine
(δ 1.92, multiplet (m), δ 2.11, m, δ 2.26, t, δ
3.66, q, δ 4.19, m, δ 7.37, t, δ 7.43, t, δ
7.90, d). The variation was evenly distributed in both control and
Paraquat toxicity classes. An illustration of the means and variances
in signal intensities for these metabolites are shown in Supporting Information Table S-1 for N = 30, and these were proportionally expanded for all other
data sets. All spectral data sets were generated using MetAssimulo
software.32 Within the software package,
the HMDB database33 and a local NMR standard
spectra database were used to extract information for 1H NMR metabolite signals. The concentrations of the remaining metabolites
were simulated using the same Gaussian distributions for the whole
data set. Each simulated spectrum covered a chemical shift region
of δ 0–10 with 27 679 spectral variables. The
peak shift Δδ was set by using the default parameters
of the software package and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) was set to
100. The simulated spectral data were mean centered and scaled to
unit variance prior to normalization by the probabilistic quotient
normalization (PQN) method using the median spectrum from the whole
data set as a reference.34

Hydrazine Toxicology
Study
This study formed part of
the Consortium for Metabonomic Toxicology (COMET) project. Details
of this study can be found in Lindon et al.35 Briefly, three groups of male Sprague–Dawley rats, N = 50 in each group, were administered a single dose of
either saline (control) or hydrazine hydrochloride in saline at 90
mg/kg or 30 mg/kg (high and low dose interventions, respectively).
Urine samples collected over the following nine time periods were
analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy: t1 = −8
to 0 h, t2 = 0 to 8 h, t3 = 8 to 24 h, t4 = 24 to 48 h, t5 = 48 to 72 h, t6 =
72 to 96 h, t7 = 96 to 120 h, t8 = 120 to 144
h, and t9 = 144 to 168 h. Half of the rats were killed
at 48 h postdose for histology, leaving 25 rats in each group after
t5.

NMR Spectroscopy
Each 200 μL
of urine sample
was added to 200 μL of phosphate buffer containing 10% deuterium
oxide. 1H NMR spectra of urine were acquired on a Bruker
DRX600 spectrometer operating at 600.13 MHz 1H observation
frequency using the BEST (Bruker Efficient Sample Transfer) 5 mm flow-injection
probe for sample delivery and analysis. One-dimensional (1D) NMR spectra
of urine samples were acquired using a solvent presaturation pulse
sequence to suppress the residual water resonance. Sixty-four free
induction decays (FIDs) were collected into 64 k data points, at 300
K, using a spectral width of 12019 Hz, with an acquisition time of
2.04 s, giving a total pulse recycle delay of 3.04 s. These data were
zero-filled by a factor of 2, and the FIDs were multiplied by an exponential
weighting function equivalent to a line broadening of 0.3 Hz prior
to Fourier transformation (FT).

Pretreatment of NMR Spectra
The raw spectral data were
loaded using the BATMAN R package.36 The
spectra were referenced to an internal standard (sodium 3-trimethylsilyl-[2,2,3,3-2H4]-propionate, TSP). The spectral regions containing
water and urea resonances were excluded, leaving chemical shift ranges
from δ 0.24–4.48 and δ 5.96–9.96. The spectra
were visually checked, and those with poor water suppression and hence
distorted baselines were excluded. The resulting numbers of spectra
included in the multivariate analysis are given in Table S-2 in Supporting Information. Each spectrum consisted
of 27 679 variables with a bin width 0.0003 ppm. As with the
simulated data, these spectral data were mean-centered and scaled
to unit variance before normalization using the median PQN method.

Data Analysis
Using the simulated data set, we aimed
to evaluate whether the correct discriminatory variables for “toxicity”
could be identified. Here, we considered a spectral variable to be
discriminatory if the p-value of the correlations
between the spectral variable and the OPLS-DA scores vector37 was smaller than μp and the OPLS-DA loading weight6 was larger than μw. As there are
initially no established values for μp and μw, we used 1.85 × 10–6 for μp (corresponding
to 0.05 after Šidák correction38), and we used the simulated data sets to establish an appropriate
μw value. We subsequently applied
the same μw in the hydrazine toxicity
study. Using these criteria, we evaluated if we could correctly identify
the homogeneous and idiosyncratic responders within the simulated
data sets and compared the performance of SHOCSY to standard OPLS-DA
method for their sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy. PCA
scores plots were employed to provide an overview of the whole data
set as well as to map the homogeneous and idiosyncratic subsets individually.
The predictive ability of the OPLS-DA models built on the homogeneous
subsets were compared to the model based on the whole data set, using
7-fold and double cross-validation Q2.39 Permutation tests were calculated by randomly
assigning classes to the samples, and remodelling was repeated 50
times. To establish the model significance, the Q2 statistics for the actual model was compared to the
empirical null distribution obtained from the permuted Q2.

Statistical HOmogeneous Cluster SpectroscopY
(SHOCSY)
The proposed algorithm consists of four steps, in
which Step 1–3
are performed iteratively: (i), identifying discriminatory spectral
variables by OPLS-DA; (ii), clustering of spectra based on the discriminatory
variables by K-means; (iii), identifying homogeneous subsets using
an enrichment test; and (iv) extracting discriminating metabolic features
based on the homogeneous subsets.

Step 1: Standard OPLS-DA analysis
is performed to identify potential discriminatory spectral variables.
A spectral variable is classified as discriminatory when the p-value of the correlations between the spectral variable
and the OPLS-DA scores <1.85 × 10–6 and
at the same time, its OPLS-DA loading weight >0.3, where this cutoff
point was found to be appropriate for all the simulated data sets.
In SHOCSY, the whole data set is only used in Step 1 of the first
iteration. Subsequent iterations use subsets of the data set showing
similar metabolic features.

Step 2: K-means method is applied
to categorize the data set into
a few clusters. We assume each biological class could potentially
consist of two clusters—one cluster showing the dominant metabolic
features as identified in step 1 and another lacking these metabolic
features. We therefore cluster the data set to model the dominant
metabolic features by the “K”-means method. In K-means
clustering, the NMR spectral data are grouped to minimize within-group
diversity but maximize between-groups diversity by Euclidean distance.
Thus, for a biological class that is highly homogeneous, all the spectra
can be clustered in one cluster showing the dominant metabolic features.
However, for a biological class that is heterogeneous, two clusters
can be formed (i.e., a cluster of spectra showing the dominant metabolic
features and another cluster of spectra lacking these metabolic features).
Consequently, for a data set consisting of two biological classes,
a total of up to four clusters may be generated.

Step 3: A hypergeometric
enrichment test is used to identify the
dominant cluster for each biological class and thus associates clusters
to specific biological classes within the data set. This enables the
identification of spectral data with dominant metabolite features.
Here, the cluster is considered dominant for a biological class when p ≤ 0.05 and thus considered as the homogeneous subset
for that specific biological class. The other clusters with p > 0.05 are therefore considered idiosyncratic responders.
However, when both clusters of a biological class show p > 0.05, the algorithm ceases to work, and this indicates that
no
dominant metabolic feature can be identified for this biological class.
The identified homogeneous subsets for each biological class from
the first iteration are fed back to Step 1 of the algorithm. In the
subsequent iteration, a new set of discriminatory spectral variables
are identified using these homogeneous subsets from each biological
class. Subsequently, new K-means clusters are formed to generate updated
homogeneous subsets. When the “truly” homogeneous subsets
have been identified, the iteration will stop as the predictive ability
of the OPLS-DA model is maximized (Figure S-1).

Step 4: The homogeneous subsets with maximal Q2 are used to identify the potential discriminatory variables.
The OPLS-DA model based on these homogeneous spectra will enable a
more robust selection of biomarkers.

A schematic diagram describing
the SHOCSY algorithm, for a data
set containing two biological classes, is shown in Figure 1. All calculations and the SHOCSY algorithm were
written in MATLAB (R2012a, Mathworks, Natick, U.S.A.) environment.
The matlab code identifying the homogeneous and idiosyncratic responders
is available on request.

samples; and the open circles and rectangles denote idiosyncratic
samples.

Results and Discussion
Evaluation
of the Performance of the SHOCSY Algorithm on a Simulated
NMR Spectral Data Set
The SHOCSY algorithm was evaluated
by varying the μw while fixing μp = 1.85 × 10–6 (0.05
after Šidák correction). Using the simulated data sets,
we found that a μw value ranging
from 0.2 to 0.6 was able to correctly identify all four metabolite
signals corresponding to “Paraquat toxicity”. When the
μw value was increased to >0.7,
these models only identified three metabolites as biomarkers. This
demonstrates that a high μw value
increases the risk of excluding genuine biomarkers. We therefore adopted
a conservative cutoff value, μw =
0.3, for the remaining analyses to ensure reliable biomarker signature
selection. However, the standard OPLS-DA only identified creatinine
and citrate even a low μw of 0.2
was used when the proportion of idiosyncratic spectra is >33.3%.

The PCA scores plot based on the whole data set (N = 30 in each biological class with 50% idiosyncratic spectra) shows
that some spectra in the simulated Paraquat group cocluster with the
control class (Figure 2a). We then evaluated
the ability of the SHOCSY algorithm to correctly identify the homogeneous
and idiosyncratic subsets within the data set. SHOCSY was found to
be highly reliable (Figure 2b) and more robust
than standard OPLS-DA approach. SHOCSY showed an overall accuracy
of ≥0.94, sensitivity ≥0.94, and specificity ≥0.80
irrespective of data set size and the extent of idiosyncratic responders.
This was not the case for the standard OPLS-DA approach, where the
overall accuracy fell to 0.75 and with poor specificity (Supporting Information Table S-3). The median 1H NMR spectra of the homogeneous control, idiosyncratic responders,
and homogeneous responders are shown in Figure 2c. It can be clearly seen that the idiosyncratic responders had similar
spectral features to those of the control. In addition, the homogeneous
responders manifested an increase in lactate and l-alanine
but a reduction in the intensity of creatinine and citrate signals.
When the proportion of idiosyncratic responders is low (e.g., 5%),
both 7-fold and double cross-validation methods show comparable results
for the standard OPLSDA approach (Supporting Information
Table S-4). As the proportion of idiosyncratic responders increases,
the Q2 decreases progressively. However,
when the homogeneous subgroups were used, both the 7-fold and double
cross-validation generated comparable Q2 values and remained high (>0.78, permutation test of p < 10–5 for all data sets). These
high Q2 values are due to the exclusion
of idiosyncratic
responders from the data set, which removes irrelevant responses from
the model and thus improves the predictivity of the model. Moreover,
with 50% idiosyncratic spectra, the l-alanine and lactate
signals in the standard OPLSDA were obscured by the interference samples
in the data sets and thus did not significantly differentiate the
toxicity class from control. The loading coefficient plots (Figure 2d,e) show that the loading weights for these four
metabolite signals were higher in the model based on homogeneous subsets
(r2 > 0.7) than those of the whole
data
set (r2 > 0.5, N =
30).

Paraquat toxicity. The color bar defines the weights of the corresponding

Application of SHOCSY to a Rat Hydrazine
Toxicity Study
The SHOCSY algorithm was used to identify
homogeneous subsets from
a hydrazine study in rats. The responses were highly homogeneous for
all time points except t7 (96–120 h) and t8 (120–144 h) for high dose and t5 (48–72
h) for low dose. SHOCSY was able to identify four and nine spectra
as idiosyncratic responders from the high dose hydrazine for t7 and t8, respectively. Furthermore, nine spectra
from the hydrazine low dose data at t5 were identified
as “idiosyncratic” responders. No idiosyncratic animals
were identified in the control groups. We therefore focused our subsequent
analyses using the time points where variation in responses to hydrazine
toxicity was more evident (t7 and t8 for high
dose; and t5 for low dose). As we have shown that 7-fold
and double cross-validation methods obtained comparable results using
the simulated data sets, we therefore only applied the 7-fold cross-validation
for the analysis of the hydrazine toxicity study.

The Q2 value of the OPLS-DA model obtained from the
whole data set of the high dose hydrazine class was 0.88 for t7 and 0.77 for t8 (permutation test p < 105). The model statistics improved to 0.94 for
t7 and 0.96 for t8 (permutation test p < 10–5) when homogeneous subsets
were used rather than the whole class. For the low dose, the Q2 for t5 data slightly improved from
0.75 based on whole data set to 0.77 based on the homogeneous subsets
(permutation test p < 10–5).

The OPLS-DA model coefficient plots of the whole data set and the
homogeneous subsets at t8 after administration of a high
dose of hydrazine showed both endogenous metabolites as well as hydrazine-related
metabolites as potential discriminatory biomarkers (Figure 3). On the basis of the defined criteria (i.e., p < 1.85 × 10–6 and loading weight
>0.3), the following metabolites were identified from the whole
data
set: N-α-acetyl-citrulline (δ 4.13, m,
δ 3.11, t, δ 2.03, s, δ 1.8, m, δ 1.66, m,
δ 1.52, m), 2-aminoadipic acid (δ 3.77, t, δ 2.26,
t, δ 1.89, m, δ 1.64, m), citruline (δ 3.76, t,
δ 3.15, quintet, δ 1.88, m, δ 1.52, m), 2-oxoglutarate
(δ 3.01, t, δ 2.45, t), creatinine (δ 4.05, s, δ
3.04, s), creatine (δ 3.94, s, δ 3.04, s), glycine (δ
3.54, s), and hippurate (δ 7.73, d, δ 7.64, t, δ
7.55, t, δ 3.97, d). Two additional discriminatory biomarkers
were also uncovered when the OPLS-DA model based on homogeneous subsets
was used (Figure 3c,d). These were diacetyl
hydrazine (δ 2.07, s) and beta-alanine (δ 3.19, s, δ
2.56, t). This was made possible as the exclusion of idiosyncratic
responders reduced the variability of the data set and thus potential
discriminatory biomarkers were not obscured by overlapping signals
in confounded spectra. The use of the subset optimization algorithm
therefore provided a clearer description of the potential discriminatory
biomarkers. As the focus of our current work is to demonstrate how
SHOCSY works, the biological interpretation of these metabolite signatures
is beyond the scope of this paper but relates to improved capture
both of hydrazine metabolism (diacetyl hydrazine) and the endogenous
response to liver toxicity (beta-alanine). Readers are referred to
previous publications.40,41

The median 1H NMR spectra showing the characteristics
of each homogeneous subset as well as the idiosyncratic responders
is shown in Supporting Information Figure S-2. From the loading coefficient plots (Figure 3) and the median spectra plots (Figure S-2), it can be seen that the homogeneous responders showed metabolite
signatures indicative of hydrazine toxicity. The metabolic profiles
of the idiosyncratic responders were more similar to those in the
control, as evident by the high level of metabolites such as succinate
and 2-oxoglutarate (Figure S-2). The PCA
scores plots of the median metabolic time trajectory for these rats
showed that these idiosyncratic responders recovered from the hydrazine
insult quicker than the others (Figure 4).
A similar trend was found for the high dose t7 and low
dose t5 data.

120–144 h; t9: 144–168 h.

Benefits of the SHOCSY Algorithm
The SHOCSY algorithm
is efficient: an output for the simulated and hydrazine data set was
obtained in less than 60 s when we used a computer with 16GB RAM with
a Xeon 2.4 GHz preprocessor. The algorithm converged within three
iterations for all data sets. This time taken for SHOCSY is comparable
to a standard OPLS-DA approach. However, the double cross-validation
approach took significantly longer (>15 h, Table
S-4).

We also investigated the proportion of idiosyncratic
responders in a biological class that the algorithm can tolerate.
Using the simulated data sets, we varied the proportion of idiosyncratic
responders from 5% to 50%. We found the SHOCSY algorithm could tolerate
up to 50% of the spectra showing idiosyncratic responses, without
compromising the validity of the model (Table
S-3 and S-4). However, this was not the case for standard OPLS-DA
approach. Our results showed that our algorithm will work despite
extreme condition, and therefore, it will be suitable for use in most
biological data sets, particularly those with high variation of nonresponders.

Having developed the SHOCSY algorithm, we applied it successfully
to a rodent NMR-based metabonomics study. However, we envisage that
the algorithm will be particularly appropriate for spectral data generated
from human studies, where varying responses to intervention, such
as drugs treatments42−44 and susceptibility to side effects of drugs,13,45 have been observed. As the key goal of SHOCSY is for data variation
reduction to improve the reliability of multivariate modeling and
to enhance robust biomarkers selection, the mathematical criteria
can also be applied to other “omics”-based data sets
as well as other data types of spectroscopic data (e.g., GC-MS or
LC-MS). Furthermore, the proposed algorithm could also be applied
in combination with various data analyses methods other than OPLS-DA.

Conclusion
The reliability of modeling and the extraction
of biomarkers are
both critical aspects of metabolic profiling studies. Established
methods such as OPLS-DA can fail to correctly identify relevant biomarkers
when there is variation in responses to biological studies. We have
shown how SHOCSY can improve the model classification ability for
NMR spectra, while tolerating high variation of responses or idiosyncratic
behavior in up to 50% of the data set. Unlike currently used methods,
SHOCSY iteratively “learns” the metabolic features best
representing the biological classes in the data set and identifies
irrelevant samples lacking these features. This enhances the robustness
of the biomarker selection process. Moreover, SHOCSY has wide applicability
and is not limited to analysis of NMR spectroscopic data.
