Parahydrogen-induced polarization
(PHIP) was used to demonstrate
the concept that highly polarized, catalyst-free fluids can be obtained
in a catalysis-free regime using a chemical reaction with molecular
addition of parahydrogen to a water-soluble Rh(I) complex carrying
a payload of compound with unsaturated (C=C) bonds. Hydrogenation
of norbornadiene leads to formation of norbornene, which is eliminated
from the Rh(I) complex and, therefore, leaves the aqueous phase and
becomes a gaseous hyperpolarized molecule. The Rh(I) metal complex
resides in the original liquid phase, while the product of hydrogen
addition is found exclusively in the gaseous phase based on the affinity.
Hyperpolarized norbornene 1H NMR signals observed in situ were enhanced by a factor of approximately 10 000
at a static field of 47.5 mT. High-resolution 1H NMR at
a field of 9.4 T was used for ex situ detection of
hyperpolarized norbornene in the gaseous phase, where a signal enhancement
factor of approximately 160 was observed. This concept of stoichiometric
as opposed to purely catalytic use of PHIP-available complexes with
an unsaturated payload precursor molecule can be extended to other
contrast agents for both homogeneous and heterogeneous PHIP. The Rh(I)
complex was employed in aqueous medium suitable for production of
hyperpolarized contrast agents for biomedical use. Detection of PHIP
hyperpolarized gas by low-field NMR is demonstrated here for the first
time.

==== Body
The low intrinsic
sensitivity
of NMR imposes limits on a wide range of its applications. A number
of NMR hyperpolarization approaches address this sensitivity problem
by generating a nonequilibrium population of nuclear spin sublevels,
with population differences significantly greater than those corresponding
to canonical Boltzmann distribution under thermal equilibrium. For
example, polarization transfer from unpaired electrons using dynamic
nuclear polarization (DNP)1 and spin exchange
optical pumping (SEOP) of 3He2 and 129Xe3 have provided signal
enhancements by 104-fold, almost to a theoretical maximum
corresponding to 100% nuclear spin polarization.4 Also, pairwise addition of two protons of the parahydrogen
(para-H2) molecule to an unsaturated substrate with a C=C
or C≡C bond yields parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP),5 which was demonstrated via the parahydrogen and
synthesis allow dramatically enhanced nuclear alignment (PASADENA)
technique by Bowers and Weitekamp, and potentially allows one to achieve
a 100% nuclear spin hyperpolarization.6,7 The polarization
of the nascent para-H2 protons can be further transferred
to nearby spins in the product molecule including adjacent, slowly
relaxing 13C sites to significantly prolong the lifetime
of hyperpolarization.8,9 PHIP is a chemistry-based hyperpolarization
method. Importantly, PHIP is a relatively inexpensive technique compared
to DNP and SEOP, with the main costs arising from the need to produce
para-H2 by cryo-cooling.10,11

Achieving
high levels of PHIP requires that addition of para-H2 is
molecular (i.e., pairwise) and is fast on the time scale
of the nuclear spin relaxation processes in reaction intermediates
and products. Therefore, the catalyst is the key element of the PHIP
production procedure. Recent advances in chemistry led to the development
of a number of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts accommodating
these requirements. For example, homogeneous water-soluble Rh-based
catalysts were successfully used for PHIP-based hyperpolarization
of 13C-labeled contrast agents12−14 intended for in vivo MRI applications.14,15 Furthermore,
it was successfully shown that the observation of PHIP effects is
also possible using heterogeneous hydrogenation over immobilized metal
complexes16−20 and supported metal catalysts.20−23 In fact, investigation of reaction
mechanisms in catalysis is one of the important applications of PHIP.20,24,25

The main disadvantage of
homogeneous hydrogenation for production
of hyperpolarized (HP) products is the difficulty of their separation
from the dissolved catalyst. While the separation may be realized
by cation-exchange filtration,21 complete
removal of the dissolved metal complex requires extra time, and avoiding
partial loss of polarization is hardly possible. With PHIP based on
heterogeneous catalysts, the catalyst can be easily removed, reused,
or recycled, or the process may be run in a continuous mode. The feasibility
of catalyst removal by phase separation was recently demonstrated.26 Hydrogenation in an organic solvent followed
by HP product extraction into a second liquid phase led to a catalyst-free
aqueous solution of 13C HP succinic acid.26 Alternatively, biphasic gas–liquid catalytic processes
can be employed for hydrogenation of a gaseous substrate passed through
a liquid containing dissolved catalyst, where the HP product can escape
into the gas phase and is thus separated from the catalyst.27

In this study, a new approach to produce
pure HP fluids was demonstrated,
which is based on a stoichiometric rather than a catalytic chemical
reaction. A complex between a transition metal and an unsaturated
substrate was formed directly in water. Following the hydrogenation
by para-H2, the water-insoluble HP product molecule migrated
into the gas phase. The high efficiency of Rh(I) complexes for molecular
addition of para-H2 to an unsaturated substrate molecule
provides a large PHIP enhancement factor ε, which is the measure
of nuclear spin polarization enhancement with respect to Boltzmann
equilibrium. At the same time, the use of such a “premade”
[Me-substrate] complex allows one to employ PHIP for an efficient
production of HP molecules. This reduces experimental demands because
the precursor metal complex is combined with the substrate in advance,
in contrast to conventional PHIP where mixing takes place during the
experiment. The preformed Rh(I) complex with precursor is utilized
directly as the only compound necessary to react with para-H2 to yield heterogeneous PHIP.

A ligand exchange process leads
to the formation of a water-soluble
Rh(I) complex 1 shown in Figure 1a as follows: 1  where NBD is norbornadiene and L
is the water-soluble
bisphosphine ligand (Figure 1b) used in PHIP
of several HP contrast agents in aqueous medium for in vivo use.12,14,15 The Supporting Information provides the details of
Rh(I) complex preparation.21 Subsequent
H2 bubbling through the aqueous solution of 1 leads to the formation of norbornene (NBN) as the major product
of H2 addition to NBD, Figure 1a.28 While formation of PHIP during NBD hydrogenation
to NBN was studied before,28−30 NBN is used here as a well-studied
molecule for exploring the heterogeneous approach.

Figure 1 (a) Molecular diagram
of polarized norbornene (NBN) formation in
the PHIP experiment via molecular addition of para-H2;
(b) molecular structure of the bisphosphine ligand.

Importantly, NBN is a solid at room temperature,
with a melting
point of 42–46 °C and is insoluble in water. When para-H2 (>90% para-isomer)10 was used
in the hydrogenation reaction of 1, the polarized NBN
was detected in the gas phase only, Figures 2 and S1, Supporting Information. The hydrogenation
reaction was carried out in a reactor outside the main magnetic field
of a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer with subsequent gas transfer to the
NMR probe for spectra acquisition, which corresponds to the PHIP ALTADENA31 condition and results in signal enhancement
of protons in positions 5 and 6 of NBN, Figure 2a. Hydrogenation of 1 with normal H2 (ortho-/para-
= 3/1) under the same conditions leads to an NMR spectrum in which
the NBN signals are below the noise level, Figure 2b. In addition, no detectable NBN signal was observed in the
liquid phase, Figure S1a, Supporting Information, when NMR spectra were acquired in situ after bubbling
para-H2 through a solution of 1. The absence
of NBN NMR signals in Figure 2b indicates that
its concentration in the gas phase is low (see below). Because the
NMR signal of NBN in Figure 2b may also be
suppressed due to the fast flow of the gas,20 the NMR spectrum was recorded after the flow of the para-H2 stream carrying NBN was stopped, and it revealed the same trend,
Figure S2b, Supporting Information.

bubbling of para-H2 (a) and normal H2 (b) through
D2O solution of 1 at 70–80 °C.
The broad signal labeled “H2” belongs to
ortho-H2; the resonances labeled with open circles correspond
to norbornane.32 Both spectra were acquired
at 9.4 T with 4 averages using the same experimental setup and flow/timing
conditions. (c) Diagram of the high-field experimental setup.

Moreover, the formation of HP
NBN was additionally verified by
dissolving [Rh(I)(NBD)2]+BF4– in an organic solvent (C6D6/CD3OD = 5/1.5). When para-H2 was bubbled through this
solution, polarized NBN was detected only in the liquid phase due
to its high solubility in this solvent (Figure S1b, Supporting Information), while no NBN in the gas phase could
be detected (Figure S3a, Supporting Information).

Formation of NBN from 1 via hydrogenation is
an irreversible
process. As a result, the concentration of polarized NBN decreases
with reaction time. The signal from HP NBN was compared to the spectrum
of NBN produced with normal H2; see the Supporting Information for details, yielding an enhancement
factor of ca. 164 for protons in positions 5 and 6, Figure 2a. The polarization loss during NBN transport in
the gas phase due to relaxation of nuclear spins significantly decreases
the intensities of NMR resonances of HP NBN. Nevertheless, an enhancement
of 164 at 9.4 T represents 0.5% nuclear spin polarization per proton.

Other HP signals of NBN in the spectrum shown in Figure 2a could be due to polarization transfer from HP
proton pairs of nascent para-H2 protons as previously observed
in PASADENA28,29,33 as well as in ALTADENA30 experiments.
The enhancements were 10 and 18 for NBN protons in positions 2 and
1, respectively.

Next, the hydrogenation reaction was carried
out in a 47.5 mT magnet
with in situ detection capability with the goal of
estimating the feasibility of low-field34 NMR detection of polarized gases produced in a PHIP experiment,
Figure 3d.35,36 The hydrogenation
of 1 was carried out at approximately 7 atm of para-H2. The HP signal from NBN gas was successfully detected, Figure 3a (details in the Supporting
Information).

mT magnet performed at 2.0193 MHz resonance frequency. (a) 1H NMR spectrum of the reaction mixture (3.6 mL, 10 mM aqueous solution

the
same reaction mixture as in (a) injected into an atmosphere of H2 gas with statistical distribution of ortho- and para-isomers.
(c) Reference spectrum of ca. 56 mL of water doped with ∼5

with solenoid valves controlled via the spectrometer interface. The
NBN spectra were acquired with 8 averages with the detector in averaging
mode. The 1H NMR reference spectrum of water was recorded
using a single scan after automated shimming.

When accounting for reference sample and HP NBN quantities,
a HP
signal with enhancement factor ε = 10300 ± 1000 for polarized
protons of NBN gas with respect to thermal equilibrium at 47.5 mT
was achieved; see the Supporting Information. Due to the original geometry of the experimental setup in the low
field, there are no significant delivery losses of NBN due to its
condensation on the reactor walls, and the relaxation processes should
not significantly diminish signal intensity. The primary factor dramatically
lowering the enhancement factor ε measured in the low field
is the kinetics of hydrogenation, and the above factor of 10 300
at 47.5 mT assumes that NBN was produced with 100% yield during a
3 s reaction and was fully detected. This is not the case as NBN signal
was observable for at least several acquisitions. The resulting antiphase
signal from the HP NBN would likely suffer further intensity loss
from partial NMR resonance collapse, which is likely to be of an order
of magnitude due to a spin–spin coupling of only 6–10
Hz (note that chemical shift difference of the endo- and exo-protons
is less than 2 Hz at 47.5 mT) for this type of spin system and the
NMR half height line width significantly exceeding the size of the
spin–spin coupling. Nevertheless, the observed enhancement
factor of 10 300 at 47.5 mT corresponds to polarization of
0.2% per HP proton, which is in a qualitative agreement with the 0.5%
value estimated at 9.4 T.

A significant potential advantage
of the presented approach is
the possibility to synthesize metal complexes containing specific
substrates as ligands coordinated to the metal center, which should
produce polarized products via molecular addition of para-H2 in the same or different phase. Arguably, the presented approach
requires more Rh for production of an equivalent amount of HP product
compared to the purely catalysis-based approach where one equivalent
of Rh can hydrogenate several equivalents of a substrate. This disadvantage
can be mitigated by Rh recycling, because it remains in a phase different
from the phase of the HP product. Moreover, the presented approach
based on the use of preformed metal-substrate complexes may prove
useful for PHIP precursors that are more difficult to hydrogenate,
where the conventional catalytic approach is too slow, leading to
a significantly expanded range of molecules that can be polarized
using PHIP. Furthermore, recycling of the metal complex in the original
phase by addition of a new batch of substrate followed by hydrogenation
with para-H2 may potentially lead to new approaches for
preparation of pure HP fluids.

Conclusions
The demonstrated approach
uses a metal complex, in which the C=C
double bond of a desired substrate is coordinated to the metal center.
Once the substrate is hydrogenated with para-H2, the product
molecule migrates to a different phase, becoming a pure HP fluid without
any additional purification steps. It was shown for the first time,
to the best of our knowledge, that a gas polarized using the PHIP
method may be successfully detected using 1H NMR at low
magnetic fields. The PHIP-induced signal enhancement ε of >160
was demonstrated in the high magnetic field of 9.4 T, and ε
> 10 000 at the low magnetic field of 47.5 mT. The importance
of the results presented here stems from the breadth of potential
applications in the context of developing highly polarized and pure
PHIP fluids for various physical, chemical, and biomedical studies
while also expanding the range of molecules amenable to hyperpolarization
using PHIP. The latter can be accomplished via targeted synthesis
of Rh(I)-substrate complexes that can be more amenable to hydrogenation
compared to free substrates not coordinated to the active metal center.
In particular, Ir and Rh complexes containing acetylenedicarboxylic
acid, its dimethyl or diethyl esters, or maleic anhydride as one of
the ligands have been successfully synthesized, isolated, and characterized.37 These unsaturated compounds have been used previously
in PHIP studies,15,26,38,39 and their HP products have been already
considered in biological PHIP applications.
