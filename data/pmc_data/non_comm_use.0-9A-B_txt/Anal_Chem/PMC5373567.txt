comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC
× LC) offers ways to achieve high-performance separations in
terms of peak capacity (exceeding 1000) and additional selectivity
to realize applications that cannot be addressed with one-dimensional
chromatography (1D-LC). However, the greater resolving power of LC
× LC comes at the price of higher dilutions (thus, reduced sensitivity)
and, often, long analysis times (>100 min). The need to preserve
the
separation attained in the first dimension (1D) causes
greater dilution for LC × LC, in comparison with 1D-LC, and long
analysis times to sample the 1D with an adequate number
of second dimension separations. A way to significantly reduce these
downsides is to introduce a concentration step between the two chromatographic
dimensions. In this work we present a possible active-modulation approach
to concentrate the fractions of 1D effluent. A typical
LC × LC system is used with the addition of a dilution flow to
decrease the strength of the 1D effluent and a modulation
unit that uses trap columns. The potential of this approach is demonstrated
for the separation of tristyrylphenol ethoxylate phosphate surfactants,
using a combination of hydrophilic interaction and reversed-phase
liquid chromatography. The modified LC × LC system enabled us
to halve the analysis time necessary to obtain a similar degree of
separation efficiency with respect to UHPLC based LC × LC and
of 5 times with respect to HPLC instrumentation (40 compared with
80 and 200 min, respectively), while at the same time reducing dilution
(DF of 142, 299, and 1529, respectively) and solvent consumption per
analysis (78, 120, and 800 mL, respectively).

==== Body
Two-dimensional
liquid chromatography
is a technique that allows the characterization of samples that, due
to their complexity, cannot be resolved using one-dimensional chromatography.
The higher resolving power is a direct consequence of the consecutive
separation of the sample components using two distinct chromatographic
processes that exploit different selectivity principles. In comprehensive,
two-dimensional LC (LC × LC), the entire sample is subjected
to the two different separations. In off-line LC × LC there are
no restrictions on the speed of analysis in the second dimension,
making this the best way to exploit the full resolving power of both
the separation dimensions.1,2 However, the resulting
long overall analysis times make this technique impractical for routine
analysis of large numbers of samples.

Online LC × LC has
the advantage of significantly decreasing
the analysis time necessary to obtain a high peak capacity. However,
the tight constraints imposed by the coupling of the two chromatographic
processes seriously limit the separation efficiency. The second dimension
separations (2D) must be fast to allow frequent sampling
of the first separation (1D), while providing sufficient
resolving power. Studies have demonstrated that the optimal number
of fractions per 1D peak is somewhere between 2 and 4.3−6 Moreover, to reduce the volumes collected for injection onto the 2D column, the 1D separation has to be run at low,
often suboptimal,7 linear flow velocities,
and thus, long run times are required to deliver efficient gradients
(spanning at least five column volumes). Other restrictions are related
to the compatibility of the mobile phases used in the two dimensions8 and to the volume of sample that can be injected
on the 2D column.9,10

If online LC
× LC is to become more frequently adopted for
routine analysis, robust high-throughput analysis exploiting orthogonal
selectivities will need to be developed. In this context, it is important
to develop strategies that enable fast and efficient separations.

Significant shortening of the analysis time can be achieved by
reducing the 2D cycle time using ultra-high-pressure LC
(UHPLC),11−13 increased temperatures,14 or parallel 2D15,16 technologies that are
now available in commercialized LC × LC systems. However, to
reduce the injection band broadening in the second dimension, these
systems use combinations of long and narrow 1D columns
(e.g., 1 or 2.1 mm I.D.) and short and wide 2D columns
(e.g., 4.6 mm I.D). Using such configurations, it is possible to minimize
the ratio between the volume of the fractions collected from the first
dimension and the 2D column volume,5 typically injecting less than 10% of the 2D column volume.
As a consequence, high peak capacities are obtained at the price of
high dilutions and, thus, loss in sensitivity.

Alternative column
couplings have been suggested to limit the injection
band broadening without increasing the dilution and allow combinations
of chromatographic modes that make use of incompatible solvents. Examples
include interfaces with trap columns instead of loops,17−23 vacuum evaporation,24 and thermally assisted
modulation.21,25 These technologies have proven,
with different degrees of success, their effectiveness at reducing
problems connected with the injection of strong or incompatible solvents
in the 2D system, but they have not yet reached a level
of maturity that would allow their use in routine LC × LC applications.

In this work we present an active-modulation approach (LC/a × m/LC) in which the fractions collected
from the 1D are concentrated prior to injection in the 2D. This is achieved using a HPLC × UHPLC system that
was modified to include a dilution flow to decrease the mobile phase
strength of the 1D effluent and a modulation unit that
uses trap columns. This configuration allows, in comparison with the
conventional loop interface (“passive-modulation”),
linear velocities closer to the optimum in the 1D without
using flow splitters.7,26 The LC/a × m/LC system also
reduces the effects of the 1D dead times (consequences
of low flow rates in the first dimension), dwell volumes, and 2D injection band broadening (thanks to the reduction of the
volumes collected from the 1D). Together, these result
in a considerably shorter time necessary to obtain a specified separation
efficiency.

The feasibility of LC/a × m/LC is demonstrated
for the separation
of tristyrylphenol ethoxylate-phosphate (TSP) surfactants (polymeric
compounds), using a combination of hydrophilic interaction LC and
reversed-phase LC (HILIC × RPLC). Thanks to the independent selectivities
offered by this method, the sample can be separated according to its
ethoxylate chain length (HILIC) and the degree of styrene and phosphate
substitution (RP).

Experimental Section
Chemicals
The
samples used for this study are tristyrylphenol
ethoxylate (TSP; CAS 99734–09–05), commercially available
under the names Agent 3152–90 and Termul 3150; tristyrylphenol
ethoxylate phosphate (TSP phosphate CAS 90093–37–1)
as Agnique PE TSP 16A, Agent 3152–92, and Soprophor 3D33. The
chemical structure of the compounds is reported in Figure 1. The solvents used were Milli-Q
grade water (18.2 mΩ) and liquid-chromatography-grade acetonitrile
(ACN), methanol (MeOH), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and 1-butanol, obtained
from Avantor Performance Materials B.V. (Deventer, NL). Ammonium acetate
(Bioxtra grade, 99% purity) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Zwijndrecht,
NL). All materials were used as received, and the mobile phases were
not filtered prior to use.

Samples were prepared by dissolving
the surfactant in a mixture of 94% ACN, 5% THF, and 1% 12.5 mM ammonium
acetate at the concentrations reported in Table 1 for the HILIC × RP separations or at
1 mg/mL for the HILIC study reported in Figures 2 and 3. The performance
of the different RP materials (Figure 4) was studied with a 1 mg/mL solution of surfactants
in H20/ACN 1/1 v/v.

Instrumentation and Data
Analysis
HPLC × HPLC
An LC × LC instrument composed
of an Agilent (Waldbronn, Germany) 1100 quaternary (1D)
pump (Model G1311A) and a 1260 quaternary (2D) pump (Model
G1311B), two degassers (Model G1322), thermostats (Model G1316A),
detectors (Model G4212B with 13 μL flow cell), one autosampler
(Model G1329B), and a 10-port two-position switching valve (Agilent
G4232A and G1170A support unit) with 60 μL loops was used for
our experiments. The valve was configured for back-flush injection,27 and all Agilent modules were controlled using
Agilent Chemstation B.04.03 software on two different computers, the
first was used to control the autosampler, 1D pump and
thermostat, and detector, while the second controlled the switching
valve, 2D pump, and detector. The data were exported as
comma-separated files and processed using a recently published Matlab-2014b
(The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, U.S.A.) script.28,29

A Kromasil 60 Si–OH 1D column (250 ×
3 mm i.d.; 5 μm particles; 60 Å pore size; Hichrom Ltd.,
Reading, United Kingdom) was used, followed by a stainless steel tee
(Model U-428, IDEX Corp; DaVinci, Rotterdam NL) to split the flow
before the switching valve. Stainless steel tubing of the same I.D.
and length (75 μm I.D. × 200 mm) were used on the two sides
of the tee to approach a split ratio of 1:1. As 2D column
we used a Phenomenex Kinetex C18 (50 × 4.6 mm; 2.6 μm;
100 Å, Phenomenex, Macclesfield, U.K.). Operation conditions
and further details are reported in Table 1.

HPLC × UHPLC and HPLC/a × m/UHPLC
An Agilent
1200 degasser (G1379), a 1200 SL binary pump (Model G1312, with the
original mixer replaced by a 50 μL mixer from Waters), an autosampler
(Model G4226A), and a column thermostat compartment (Model G1316C)
were used for the 1D. The 2D was composed of
UHPLC binary pumps (Model G4220A configured with a JetWeaver V35 mixer),
a thermostated column compartment (Model G1316C), and a diode-array
UV detector (DAD, Model G4212A) with a standard flow cell (13 μL
volume). The valve schematically shown in Figure 5 is a 4-port duo 2-position valve (Model
5067–4214) installed in the 2D thermostat. Loops
of 40 μL were used with valve configuration for back-flush injections.

We used an Acquity UPLC BEH HILIC (150 × 2.1 mm; 1.7 μm;
130 Å; Waters, Elstree, U.K.) 1D column and an Acquity
UPLC HSS C18 2D column (50 × 2.1 mm; 1.8 μm;
100 Å). Additionally, we tested a Hypersil GOLD C-18 (50 ×
1 mm; 1.9 μm; ThermoFisher Scientific, Breda, NL) column. The
comparison between the different columns is reported in Figure 4.

The HPLC/a × m/UHPLC
setup used the same hardware described
above and, in addition, a stainless-steel tee connection (Model U-428,
IDEX Corp) to add a dilution flow after the first-separation dimension
using an isocratic pump (Model G1310B). The modulation interface was
configured for forward-flush operation and the loops where substituted
by two C-18 precolumn cartridges (2.1 × 2 mm with sub-2 μm
particles, SecurityGuard Ultra AJ0–8782, Phenomenex, Utrecht,
NL) directly installed in the switching valve and connected to the
port receiving effluent from the 1D by a 50 mm × 50
μm I.D. connection. A schematic representation of the setup
is shown in Figure 5.

All Agilent modules of this configuration were controlled
and programmed
using Agilent Chemstation C.01.04. Data analysis was performed using
GC image R 2.5 software (GCimage, Lincoln, U.S.A.). Operation conditions
are reported in the Chromatographic Conditions section and Table 1.

Chromatographic Conditions
The 1D separations
were performed using mobile phase A (94% ACN, 5% THF, 1% 12.5 mM ammonium
formate) to mobile phase B (12.5 mM ammonium acetate). In the 2D, the mobile phases used were A (99% 12.5 mM ammonium formate,
1% 1-butanol) and B (99% MeOH, 1% 1-butanol). Butanol was used to
reduce the equilibration time.30 The separation
performed using the LC/a × m/LC setup used a dilution flow composed
of 12.5-mM ammonium acetate.

The conditions used for the HPLC
× HPLC (graphical abstract and Table 1) were 1D flow rate of 0.1 mL/min
at T = 10 °C and gradient elution from 0% B
to 60% B in 140 min, 20 min at 60% B. At 180 min, the flow rate was
set to 1 mL/min and run at 0% B until 200 min. For the 2D separation we used a flow rate of 4 mL/min, T =
40 °C using, gradient elution from 40% B to 80% in 0.01 min,
from 80% to 100% at 0.76 min, kept at 100% B until 0.86 min and equilibrated
at 40% B for 0.14 min. Modulation volume = 50 μL. The HPLC ×
UHPLC separation described in Table 1 was performed using a 1D flow rate of 0.04
mL/min, T = 5 °C, gradient elution from 2% B
to 20% B in 20 min, then to 50% B at 50 min, 55% B at 60 min, and
2% B at 70 min. Flow rate increased to 0.2 mL/min at 78 min. The 2D was run at 50 °C at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min, gradient
elution from 35% B to 80% in 0.01 min, 85% to 100% at 0.35 min, 0.03
min 100% B, and at 0.4 min re-equilibration at 40% B. Modulation volume
= 20 μL. The HPLC × UHPLC and HPLC/a × m/UHPLC reported
in Figure 6 and 7 runs were performed using a 1D flow
rate of 0.08 mL/min, T = 5 °C, gradient elution
from 2% B to 20% B in 10 min, then to 50% B at 25 min, 55% B at 30
min, and 2% B at 39.99 min. Flow rate increased to 0.2 mL/min at 40
min. In the 2D T = 50 °C, gradient
elution from 35% B to 80% in 0.01 min, then to 100% at 0.29 min and
100% B at 0.30 min, followed by 0.06 min re-equilibration at 35% B
(0.35 min modulation time). The 2D flow rate was of 1.5
mL/min in the HPLC × UHPLC setup and 1.35 mL/min in the HPLC/a
× m/UHPLC. The dilution flow in used in the/a × m/setup
was 0.6 mL/min and this incremented the 1D back pressure
off approximately 100 bar. All the LC × LC separation where monitored
at 220 nm using 80 Hz scan rate.

Calculations
The
following paragraph describes the
equations adopted to obtain the results reported in Table 1.

Peak Capacity
The peak capacity (nc) was determined
from the average width at half height
(w̅1/2h) applying eq 1. 1  

For the calculation of the 1D peak capacity the
average width was obtained from the integration
of five peaks at the beginning of the chromatogram (indicated in red
in Figure 2b) and five
peaks in the area of elution of the phosphate species (green in Figure 2b). The 2D peak capacity was obtained as average of all the (5–15,
depending on tG) peaks present in the
chromatograms.

The predicted peak capacity for each LC ×
LC system was calculated
as 2  using 1nc values obtained
from one-dimensional runs under the same conditions
as the LC × LC runs (see Table 1 for the respective parameters) and 2nc calculated from the average nc of multiple 2D runs (2D nc parameter of Table 1).

Equation 2 is not
taking into account 1D undersampling and band broadening
associated with the modulation process.3,4,6

Two different approaches were used to correct
for these effects,
using the equation proposed by Davis-Li et al.6,31,32 3  where β is the undersampling correction
factor 2tc is the modulation
cycle, tG the dimension gradient time,
and that proposed by Vivó et al. for loop-based LC × LC5 4  where σ is the standard deviation
of
the peak in time units, δinj2 is 4.6, δdet2 is 4, and the required resolution Rs was set to 1.

In the case of LC/a ×
m/LC, the peak capacity was calculated
from 5  

Dilution
Factor
To calculate the dilution factor (DF)
we used the model proposed by Vivó-Truyols et al.5 6  where F is the flow rate
and Vi is the injection volume.

The dilution of the complete chromatographic process was calculated
from 7  where M is the number of
modulations in the LC × LC run.

Results and Discussion
Thanks to its high separation power, online comprehensive two-dimensional
LC is attracting increasing interest for the analysis of complex mixtures
in areas such as food,33,34 polymers,27 and life science.35−37 Although this analytical tool
has matured (with dedicated systems entering the market), some of
the limitations of the current technique need to be (further) addressed
to widen its applicability. Two important improvements regard the
shortening of the total analysis time and the reduction of the sample
dilution to facilitate the detection of low-abundant analytes.

In this work, we present a strategy to reduce analysis time and
dilution, introducing a concentration step between the two chromatographic
dimensions. Recently, we demonstrated the feasibility of such a two-dimensional
chromatographic process, which we named actively modulated LC ×
LC (LC/a × m/LC), for coupling capillary ion-exchange chromatography
with nano-RPLC connected to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)
for the analysis of complex protein digests.38 Here we report the application of LC/a × m/LC to realize analytical
scale HILIC × RPLC for the characterization of tristyrylphenol
ethoxylate surfactants (TSP).

TSPs are a group of surfactants
widely used in agrochemical formulations
that exhibit a polymeric distribution with an average of 3 styrene
and 16 ethylene-oxide units. The chemical structure of the analytes
is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Chemical structure of the commercially available tristylphenol
ethoxylates (TSPs) analyzed in this study. For products CAS 90093–37–1, R = phosphate; for CAS 99734–09–5, R = H (TSP phosphate).

The analytes are amphiphilic and contain polar (ethoxylate
and
phosphate groups) as well as lipophilic residues (styrene groups)
and, thus, can be characterized using either HILIC39 or RPLC.40

1D Analysis
Figure 2 Total-ion-current
chromatogram of the HILIC (a) and RPLC (b) analysis
of Agnique PE TSP 16A. The colors of the boxes differentiate three
different classes of compounds present in this sample. Red indicates
the ditri styrene ethoxylate, blue impurities containing two units
of the ditri styrene diethoxylate and green the ditri styrene ethoxylate
phosphate. Conditions: (a) flow rate: 1 mL/min mobile phase A: 98%
ACN 2% 12.5 mM ammonium acetate; Mobile phase B: 12.5 mM ammonium
acetate. Linear gradient 0 to 50% B in 20 min. (b) Flow rate = 1 mL/min,
mobile phase A = 25 mM ammonium acetate + 1% BuOH, mobile phase B
= MeOH + 1% BuOH; linear gradient 50–100% B in 5 min. Mass
spectrometry conditions are reported in section S2 of the Supporting Information.

Figure 2a
shows
the LC-MS total-ion-current chromatogram obtained for Agnique PE TSP
16A using a linear gradient under HILIC conditions. The styrene ethoxylates
are separated on the basis of their chain length (from low to high
degree of ethoxylation, EO). On the other hand, RPLC using fast gradients
(Figure 2b) separates
the sample according to its chemical composition, independently of
the molecular weight (pseudocritical conditions41,42). As depicted in Figure 2b, it is possible to separate analytes with different degrees
of styrene substitution in the ethoxylate and ethoxylate-phosphate
and impurities originating from the inclusion of more than one styryl
ethoxylate unit in the polymer (more details on the LC-MS investigation
are reported in section S2 of the Supporting Information).

The two separations target different properties of the sample
(sample dimensions43) to separate it on
the basis of two independent (orthogonal44) mechanisms. As a consequence, the species are eluting in a different
order in HILIC (Figure 2a: red, blue, and green) and RP (Figure 2b: green, red, and blue).

Due to the
prevalence of several sample dimensions (chain length,
functional groups) in the sample, no one-dimensional LC separation
is capable of completely resolving it. The compounds ionize in ammonia-buffered
solutions and, thus, LC-MS analysis is possible. This would enable
us to characterize the polymer distribution between different species,
but it is quantitatively biased45,46 and limited in the
analysis of high-molecular-weight species (EO > 30). A further
limitation
of LC-MS relates to the high ionizability and amphiphilic character
of the analytes. The compounds are a source of contamination for the
MS and (like PEGs) they are very difficult to remove, impairing the
sensitivity. For these reasons, routine LC-MS analysis of TSPs is
not an attractive option. In contrast, given the UV activity and the
sample dimensionality characteristic of TSPs, they represent an interesting
application for LC × LC-UV.

To develop our separation method,
we initially screened different
HILIC columns (bare silica, sulfobetaine, and amide chemistry) and
selected bare silica as stationary phase due to higher separation
efficiency shown by this material (see section S1 of the Supporting Information). In Figures 3 and 4, the results
of efficiency optimization studies performed both with the 1D and 2D are summarized.

Figure 3 Effect of the gradient time (a) and of
the linear flow velocity
(b) on the peak capacity of the 1D HILIC separations. Conditions:
mobile phase A: 94% ACN, 5% THF 1% 12.5 mM ammonium acetate; mobile
phase B: 12.5 mM ammonium acetate, Vinj = 1 μL, T = 15 °C, UV detection at 220
nm. (a) Linear gradient from 0 to 30% B at u = 2.4
mm/s. (b) Linear gradient from 0 to 30% B with constant tG/t0 of 25.

We found an approximately logarithmic relationship
between the
peak capacity of the HILIC separation and the gradient time (tG; see Figure 3a). Increasing tG led to
an increase in nc up to about 220. At
constant tG/t0, the linear flow velocity also affects the peak capacity, as illustrated
in Figure 3b.

A typical TSP phosphate-sample contains 160 components (two different
levels of styrene substitution, approximately 40 distinguishable ethoxylated
units that can either be phosphated or not), together with various
other impurities. According to Giddings,43 the number of peaks that could be statistically anticipated given
a certain peak capacity is approximately 0.37 × nc, which means that only roughly 100 features of the sample
may be separated using the maximum peak capacity of 220 provided by
the developed 1D separation. Thus, the peak capacity offered
by 1D LC does not suffice to resolve these species. 1D separations may offer more resolving power using longer
columns at the price of longer analysis times (>100 min), provided
that sufficient selectivity can be obtained between the different
series. LC × LC offers much higher peak capacities and additional
selectivity in shorter times and, thus, should allow faster and more-detailed
separation of the sample.

To develop an LC × LC separation
we optimized the 2D RP separation, aiming to achieve efficient
separation in a short
time. During the optimization we investigated the relationship between
the peak capacity and the gradient time and the dilution factor using
different column technologies (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Dependence of the peak capacity on the gradient time (a)
and on
the dilution factor (b) of the 2D RP separation for the
three C18 columns considered in this study: (blue square) 50 ×
4.6 mm; 2.6 μm particles (red circle) 50 × 2.1 mm; 1.7
μm (black triangle) 50 × 1 mm; 1.9 μm. Conditions:
mobile phase A: 12.5 mM ammonium acetate + 1% 1-BuOH; mobile phase
B: MeOH + 1% BuOH. Gradient from 35% to 100% with times scaled for
different tG/t0 (see section S5 of Supporting Information); u = 7.2 mm/s, T = 50 °C, Vinj = 1 μL of Agnique TSP 16A in 50/50
ACN/H20.

We compared 1.7 μm
fully porous particles in a 2.1 mm I.D.
column, 1.9 μm fully porous particles in 1 mm I.D., and 2.6
μm core–shell particles in a 4.6 mm column. All the columns
showed similar selectivities and the sub-2-μm particles showed
clear gains in separation efficiency for fast gradients (tG/t0 < 10; Figure 4a). Moreover, using a narrower
column reduced significantly the dilution factor (Figure 4b).

Fast separations
(down to 25 s cycle time) could be used to efficiently
separate the six main polymer groups for small volume injections (0.1
or 1 μL). The peak capacity was severely reduced in case of
high injection volumes (32% for Vinj =
20 μL; see section S4 of Supporting Information). The 1 mm ID column could help reduce the dilution of the chromatographic
process. However, when used in LC × LC it suffered from lower
efficiency and its permeability decreased rapidly. Thus, we did not
use it further in the study.

LC × LC, HPLC × UHPLC, and HPLC/a
× m/UHPLC
To test the effectiveness of the two-dimensional
combination we
initially assembled a system using HPLC hardware (<40 MPa) and,
given the good results obtained, we optimized the LC × LC separation
using UHPLC technology and later actively modulated HPLC × UHPLC
(HPLC/a × m/UHPLC, see Figure 5).

Figure 5 Schematic representation of the HPLC/a × m/UHPLC
setup. A
dilution flow is delivered to reduce the mobile phase strength of
the eluent of the 1D (MF ≈ 7 × 1D flow rate) and allow the concentration of the analytes on a trap
column (e.g. Trap 1) having similar packing materials as the 2D column. Once the valve is switched the analytes bands are
eluted from the trap and separated on the 2D.

A summary of the conditions used to test the different
setups is
provided in Table 1.

Figure 4a clearly
shows how UHPLC technology helps in shortening the time needed to
achieve a certain separation efficiency (practical peak capacity).
When applied to LC × LC this allows a significant reduction of
the 2D analysis cycle time, reducing the total analysis
time (from 200 to 80 min)14 and maintaining
practically the same sampling of the 1D (see Table 1, β).31 Moreover, by programming a gradient starting from low organic
modifier and having two different gradient slopes (first varying very
rapidly, 0.6 s, from 40 to 80% of B and then slower, 16.8 s, from
80 to 100% B) we could focus relatively large volumetric fractions
of 1D (20 μL) on top of a 2D column with
the same ID as the 1D column (2.1 mm ID; injection of approximately
20% of the 2D column volume). The diameter of the column
greatly affects the dilution factor. In LC × LC narrower columns
in the 2D help to reduce the dilution (see Figure 4b) and the required eluent
volume.

To further increase the throughput of such analytical
method it
is necessary to reduce the time of each analysis (<80 min) and
thus increase the speed of the 1D and 2D separations.
One partial solution may be to shorten the 1D gradient
time. However, this would decrease the 1D separation efficiency
(due to a reduced tG/t0; see Figure 3a) and it would not help reducing the long dwell times and
column hold-up times associated with the low flow rates used (e.g.,
at 40 μL/min, t0 ≈ 10 min).
Increasing the flow rate and maintaining the same tG/t0, alleviates these problems,
but it causes larger volumes to be injected in the 2D and
shorter 2D times to maintain similar sampling of the 1D signal. Figure 6a shows the results obtained upon doubling the 1D flow rate (from 40 to 80 μL/min) and reducing the 2D cycle time (from 30 to 21 s) to maintain a similar degree of fractionation
of the 1D.31 Larger injection
volumes (28 μL) significantly increase the 2D band
broadening, rendering this approach unattractive. To overcome these
limitations and to reduce the required analysis time we applied the
active-modulation setup illustrated in Figure 5. A T-piece allowed the dilution of the 1D effluent with a water-rich makeup flow (MF; ratio MF to 1D flow rate approximately 7:1) to reduce its elution strength.
Two 5 × 2.1 mm ID trap (V ≈ 10 μL)
columns replace the empty loops in the modulation interface. Figure 6b clearly shows the
advantage of reducing the 2D injection volume (the nc, calculated according to eq 3, are of is of 750 for the LC/a × m/LC
and of 411 for the LC × LC separation). Using active modulation,
efficient (high peak capacity) and information-rich LC × LC separations
can be achieved within 40 min.

of Agent 3152–92
using loop-based (a) and active-modulation (b) interfaces. Conditions
reported in the chromatographic condition paragraph of the Experimental Section.

The traps increase the back pressure and we were limited
in the 2D by the instrument maximum (120 MPa) to a flow
rate of 1.35
mL/min in comparison with 1.5 mL/min using the loop interface. In
spite of the lower tG/t0 in the 2D it was possible to characterize
different TSPs and TSP phosphates and to clearly distinguish batches
from different producers (Figures 6b and 7a–d).

paragraph of the Experimental Section.

Conclusions
The
possibility to reduce the analysis time and the dilution of
LC × LC separations using active modulation has been demonstrated.
Active modulation offers an attractive solution to improve the LC
× LC analysis. Key features of a HPLC/a × m/UHPLC system
are the following:• The 1D flow rate can
be increased, allowing operation close to the optimal linear velocity,
providing high-peak-capacity separations in shorter analysis times
(40 instead of 80 min).

• The volumes of the fractions
collected from the 1D can be decreased, allowing faster
and efficient 2D separations (from 30 to 21 s).

• Column combinations
and analysis
conditions can be selected such that the chromatographic dilution
and the sample consumption are significantly reduced (dilution factor
from 299 to 142).

• The analysis time necessary to
obtain similar peak capacities (≈500) is reduced 2.5-fold when
progressing from LC × LC (200 min; solvent consumption per analysis
800 mL) to HPLC × UHPLC (80 min; 120 mL) and a further two times
when using active modulation (HPLC/a × m/UHPLC; 40 min; 78 mL),
while simultaneously reducing the solvent consumption.
