Cys accessibility
and quantitative intact mass spectrometry (MS)
analyses have been devised to study the topological transitions of
Mhp1, the membrane protein for sodium-linked transport of hydantoins
from Microbacterium liquefaciens. Mhp1 has been crystallized
in three forms (outward-facing open, outward-facing occluded with
substrate bound, and inward-facing open). We show that one natural
cysteine residue, Cys327, out of three, has an enhanced solvent accessibility
in the inward-facing (relative to the outward-facing) form. Reaction
of the purified protein, in detergent, with the thiol-reactive N-ethylmalemide (NEM), results in modification of Cys327,
suggesting that Mhp1 adopts predominantly inward-facing conformations.
Addition of either sodium ions or the substrate 5-benzyl-l-hydantoin (L-BH) does not shift this conformational equilibrium,
but systematic co-addition of the two results in an attenuation of
labeling, indicating a shift toward outward-facing conformations that
can be interpreted using conventional enzyme kinetic analyses. Such
measurements can afford the Km for each
ligand as well as the stoichiometry of ion–substrate-coupled
conformational changes. Mutations that perturb the substrate binding
site either result in the protein being unable to adopt outward-facing
conformations or in a global destabilization of structure. The methodology
combines covalent labeling, mass spectrometry, and kinetic analyses
in a straightforward workflow applicable to a range of systems, enabling
the interrogation of changes in a protein’s conformation required
for function at varied concentrations of substrates, and the consequences
of mutations on these conformational transitions.

==== Body
Secondary
active membrane transport
proteins exploit the potential energy of ion gradients (e.g., proton
or sodium) to drive the transport of solutes across membranes.1 The available structures of these proteins (and
other biophysical analyses) suggest a common transport mechanism,
termed alternating access, whereby substrate/ion binding sites on
the two sides of the membrane are alternately exposed.2−6 Substrate binding on one side of the membrane leads to conformational
changes that enable its release on the other side. Movements of transmembrane
helices as well as external/internal helices and loops underlie this
alternating access mechanism. The conformational state(s) of such
proteins can be determined by means of X-ray crystallography, but
elucidating the conformational state(s) and intermediates adopted
in solution, and how the binding of ligands influences the conformational
equilibrium of the protein, is of vital importance to enable full
characterization of the transport cycle.7−10

Mass Spectrometry (MS) is being employed
increasingly for the structural
interrogation of proteins and protein assemblies,11−14 with recent methodological advances
permitting the analysis of membrane proteins (MPs).15 Noncovalent MS can be employed to determine the stoichiometry
of MP assemblies,16−18 observe protein binding to lipids and small molecules,19,20 and study conformational changes upon binding (when coupled with
ion mobility spectrometry).21,22 Chemical cross-linking
MS, where a bifunctional small molecule is used to chemically join
spatially proximal residues, can be used to afford low residue distance
restraints for the modeling of protein complex architecture and conformational
changes.23−27 Mapping of solvent accessibility and dynamics can also be performed
by implementing well-established covalent labeling workflows, including
hydrogen–deuterium exchange,28,29 hydroxyl radical
footprinting,30,31 carbene labeling,32,33 and amine reactivity.23,24 Additionally, reaction
of Cys residues with maleimides, such as N-ethylmaleimide
(NEM), which react with the thiol group of Cys residues by Michael
addition, has been successfully implemented to interrogate Cys residue
accessibility and to deduce conformational/topological information.9,34,35

The transport protein Mhp1
from Microbacterium liquefaciens (M. liquefaciens) mediates the uptake of 5-aryl-substituted
hydantoins in a Na+-dependent fashion.36,37 Mhp1 is a member of the nucleobase–cation–symport-1
(NCS-1) family of secondary active transport proteins [part of the
amino acid–polyamine–organocation (APC) superfamily],
which is found widely in bacteria, archaea, fungi, and plants.2,7,38−41 NCS-1 family proteins are structurally
related by a 5-helix/5-helix internal pseudosymmetry to proteins in
different subfamilies of the APC superfamily, which is also called
the 5-helix inverted repeat (5HIRT) or LeuT superfamily of ion-coupled
transporters. In humans, membrane transport proteins of these families
are involved in processes such as neurotransmitter, sugar, amino acid,
and drug transport.42−44 The diversity of their biological functions has led
to a burgeoning field of research pertaining to unravelling the structural
basis by which this class of proteins transport their assorted substrates.2−4,6 Importantly, structures of proteins
in the 5HIRT/LeuT superfamily differ completely from those in the
major facilitator superfamily, a small number of which have been studied
by MS previously.35,45

Mhp1 contains 12 transmembrane
helices (TMHs), with 10 core TMHs,
characteristic of the 5HIRT superfamily, and two additional C-terminal
helices.48 Structures of Mhp1 in the outward-open,
inward-open, and occluded states (Figure 1a) have been solved by X-ray crystallography.46−48 TMHs 1, 2, 6, and 7 form a four helix bundle (Figure 1a, red helices), and TMHs 3, 4, 8, and 9
form a motif that resembles a hash sign (#) (Figure 1a, yellow helices).46 The ligand and Na+ binding sites are located between
the hash and bundle motifs and involve residues in TMHs 1 and 6 (where
the helices break). Binding of the ligand to the outward-facing conformation
causes TMH 10 to bend and occlude the substrate binding site; a subsequent
transition to the inward-facing conformation occurs as a result of
movement of the hashed domain relative to the bundle domain.46,48

and the surface extracellular and cytoplasmic helices are colored

(SASA) values of the three Cys residues of Mhp1 in 20 ns MD simulations

Here we combine Cys-accessibility determination by NEM reactivity,
intact MS analysis, peptide mapping, and localization of NEM modification
sites to gain insights into the topological states of Mhp1. The data
suggest that detergent-solubilized Mhp1 adopts predominantly inward-facing
conformations and that the presence of either Na+ or the
substrate L-BH does not shift this conformational equilibrium. However,
co-addition of both Na+ and L-BH results in the outward-facing
conformation being populated significantly. By titrating in various
combinations of L-BH/Na+, we demonstrate that the data
obtained can be used to extract the stoichiometry of binding which
induces the conformational change. We also demonstrate the suitability
of the method to characterize variants of Mhp1 and provide a rationale
for mutation-induced changes in substrate binding efficiency. Additionally,
we show that the approach can be used to screen ligands and identify
binders.

We envisage that the workflow developed will be widely
transferrable
and provide insights into membrane transport proteins and other protein
systems, including (i) the conformational states adopted under different
conditions; (ii) identifying and characterizing binding of (novel)
substrates and inhibitors (by using the MS method as a library screening
tool); and (iii) characterizing variants to determine whether they
have the same conformational fingerprint as the wild-type protein.

Experimental
Section
Expression and Purification of Mhp1 and Mhp1 Variants
Throughout the text, wild-type Mhp1 indicates the protein modified
by the addition of a C-terminal His6 tag.37 Expression and purification of Mhp1 and Mhp1 variants was
conducted as described previously.36,37,47−49

Labeling of Mhp1 with N-Ethylmaleimide
Solutions of purified Mhp1 (10
μM) in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8),
2.5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) DDM, and 2% (v/v) DMSO were supplemented
with one or more of the following (see figure legends): 15-crown-5
(1.25 mM), NaCl (15, 140, or 1000 mM), choline chloride (125 mM, with
15 mM NaCl), and/or L-BH (2 mM). The protein was incubated with the
appropriate additives for 10 min before labeling. NEM (1 mM final
concentration) was added, and the solution was incubated for 1 h at
25 °C. The reaction was quenched by adding DTT (final concentration
of 30 mM) and then incubating at 25 °C for 10 min.

Preparation
of Samples for Mass Spectrometry
A sample
of Mhp1 (unlabeled or labeled with NEM) (50 uL, 10 μM) was taken,
and methanol (150 μL) and chloroform (50 μL) were added.
The solution was mixed by vortexing, water (100 μL) was added,
and the solution was mixed again before centrifuging (10000g, 2 min). The upper aqueous phase was carefully removed
(leaving the white protein pellet and the lower organic phase), and
methanol (150 μL) was then added. The solution was mixed by
vortexing, centrifuged (10000g, 2 min), and the supernatant
removed. The precipitated protein was air-dried in a laminar flow
hood. The dried protein pellet was resuspended in formic acid (4 μL),
and ddH2O was then added (46 μL) for subsequent MS
analyses.

Measurement of the Intact Mass of Mhp1
Proteins were
analyzed intact using online desalting LC-MS on a nanoAcquity LC system
interfaced to a Xevo G2-S mass spectrometer (Waters Ltd., Wilmslow,
Manchester, U.K.). Deconvolution was performed using UniDec.50 All expected and observed protein masses are
shown in Table S1. See Supporting Information for details.

Proteolysis and Localization
of the Reaction Sites for NEM in
Individual Peptides
Mhp1 was digested by adding pepsin (at
a 1:50 protease:substrate mass ratio) and incubating at 37 °C
for 2 h with shaking. The protease was deactivated by boiling at 100
°C for 10 min. Peptides were then analyzed by LC-MS/MS on a nanoAcquity
LC system interfaced to a Synapt G2-Si HDMS mass spectrometer (Waters,
U.K.). See Supporting Information for details.

Mhp1 Ligand Binding Assays
The ability of Mhp1 to bind
L-BH was determined by means of fluorescence emission spectroscopy
on a QuantaMaster spectro-photofluorometer (Photon Technology International,
Ford, West Sussex, U.K.), using previously published methods.37,47,48,51 See Supporting Information for details.

Calculation of the Solvent-Accessible Surface Area of Modified
Residues
Trajectories of 20 ns all-atom molecular dynamics
simulations in an explicit membrane and solvent environment of inward-facing
(IF), outward-facing, and occluded with both the substrate and Na+ bound (OOc) and outward-facing with Na+ bound
(OF) MhpI were obtained from a previous study.52 From the coordinates of frames saved in increments of 1
ps, the average SASA of Cys69, Cys234, and Cys327 was computed. The
SASA of a residue (Ai) was calculated as the sum of the solvent accessibilities of the
individual side-chain atoms (ai).  

The atom-wise solvent-accessible
surface
area ai was calculated
analytically as described previously.53

Results and Discussion
Cys Residues in Mhp1 Predicted To Have Different
Solvent Accessibilities
The available structures of Mhp1
show that Cys327 (located in TMH
8, Figure 1) is located
near the surface of the protein whereas Cys234 and Cys69 are buried
within its structure (Figure 1a). Further comparisons of the position of Cys327 in the inward-facing
open conformation (Protein Data Bank (PDB) 2X79)46 to its
position in the outward-facing open form (PDB 2JLN)48 suggest that it becomes relatively protected from solvent
in the outward-facing conformation via reorganization of TMH 9 (Figure 1b,c). To determine
the accessibility of Cys residues in Mhp1, the residue-specific side-chain
solvent-accessible surface area values were determined in silico from
available molecular dynamics simulations in explicit membrane and
solvent environments (Figure 1d).52 The analysis showed that
the most accessible Cys residue in all three conformations of Mhp1
is Cys327, while the other two Cys residues (Cys69 and Cys234) are
more protected from solvent (Figure 1d). In addition, Cys327 is more highly accessible in
the inward-facing relative to the outward-facing conformation (Figure 1d). Combined, all
these observations suggest that the accessibility of Cys327 could
be a useful probe for discriminating between the inward-facing and
outward-facing conformational states of Mhp1.

Cys327, a Conformationally
Sensitive Residue
Following
incubation of Mhp1 with (or without) NEM (Figure 2a), electrospray ionization mass spectra
of the proteins were obtained (Figure 2b and Figure S1) and the
spectra deconvoluted (Figure 2c). In the absence of Na+ (ensured by adding the
crown ether 15-crown-5 to sequester residual Na+), the
predominant species observed corresponds to Mhp1 + 1NEM, with minimal
unlabeled Mhp1 remaining and negligible Mhp1 + 2NEM and Mhp1 + 3NEM
detected (Figure 2c,
lower panel). The modified protein was digested with pepsin, and the
modification site was localized by peptide mapping. This confirmed
that Cys327 was the dominant residue modified (Figure S2), and that the other two Cys residues were only
modified to a very low level (<1% relative abundance).

counterpart in panel b). The shading indicates expected masses of

Influence of Hydantoin and Na+ Binding on Cys Accessibility
To determine the effect (if any) of solution conditions on the
labeling reaction, Mhp1 was preincubated with NaCl, the ligand L-BH,
or a combination of both, before NEM was added. Intriguingly, the
mass distributions obtained for Mhp1 that was labeled in the presence
of either 140 mM NaCl or 2 mM L-BH were identical to those obtained
in the absence of these species (Figure 3a(i).). Conversely, co-incubation with both
140 mM NaCl and L-BH resulted in a dramatically different distribution
of masses, with both unlabeled Mhp1 and Mhp1 + NEM identified, now
with comparable intensity (Figure 3a(i)). Increasing the NaCl concentration to 1 M and
performing the NEM labeling reactions resulted in the same labeling
pattern as in the presence of 140 mM NaCl (Figure 3b(i)). Again, both 1 M NaCl and 2 mM L-BH
were required to observe a diminution in labeling, and the proportion
of labeled Mhp1 was reduced further than with 140 mM NaCl (Figure 3b(i)). The modified
Cys residue in all cases was identified as Cys327 using proteolysis
and peptide mapping (e.g., see Figure S2).

Figure 3 Mass spectrometry of wild-type Mhp1 after labeling with NEM under
different conditions of substrate and/or Na+ inclusion.
NaCl additions were performed at either (a) 140 mM NaCl or (b) 1 M
NaCl. (i) Deconvoluted mass distributions of Mhp1 after NEM labeling
under varied solution conditions. Note that at high concentrations
of both ligands the relative abundance of the +2NEM peak decreases
(although this is obscured in the figure). (ii) Relative abundances
of unlabeled Mhp1 (IU) relative to Mhp1
with 1 NEM label (I1NEM) in the mass spectra.
Data are shown as mean ± SEM of three independent experiments.

These data, combined with the
structural and SASA data presented
(Figure 1), suggest
that addition of either Na+ or L-BH is insufficient to
shift the conformational equilibrium of Mhp1. Thus, the inward-facing
conformation is favored, as in their absence. However, the synergistic
effect of both Na+ and L-BH together results in conformational
conversion to a form of the protein in which Cys327 is protected from
solvent, consistent with an alteration in the equilibrium so that
the outward-facing conformation becomes favored.

In order to
perform a semiquantitative analysis, the relative intensities
of peaks corresponding to unmodified Mhp1 and Mhp1 modified with a
single NEM label were determined (Figure 3a(ii),b(ii)). These measurements reinforce
the conclusion that adding either NaCl or L-BH alone does not significantly
alter Mhp1 modification by NEM; however, co-addition of NaCl and L-BH
leads to a significant shift in population toward unmodified Mhp1.
Intriguingly, the amount of unmodified Mhp1 observed in the presence
of 140 mM NaCl/2 mM L-BH (52.2 ± 5%) is significantly lower than
that observed in the presence of 1 M NaCl/2 mM L-BH (68.2 ± 1%).
The observation that significantly more protein remains unlabeled
in the presence of higher concentrations of NaCl suggests that the
conformational equilibrium of Mhp1 is shifted even further to the
outward-facing form by higher NaCl concentrations. From these data
we propose that the mass distribution after NEM labeling can be used
as a conformational “fingerprint” to deduce the conformational
state of the protein under varied conditions of Na+ and
ligand concentrations.

Specificity for Substrates of the Protection
against Labeling
with NEM
We tested other known ligands of Mhp147 to determine whether they produced effects similar
to L-BH. Indeed, 5-indolylmethyl-l-hydantoin (L-IMH), 5-(2-naphthylmethyl)-l-hydantoin (L-NMH), and 5-bromovinylhydantoin (BVH) in solution
at a concentration of 2 mM in the presence of 140 mM Na+ resulted in a reduction in NEM labeling to approximately similar
extents (Figure S3) as that of L-BH (Figure 3a), while addition
of ligand alone had no effect (Figure S3). Importantly, we also tested the molecules hydantoin and allantoin,
which do not bind to Mhp1.47 In the presence
of these smaller molecules, the labeling of Mhp1 is not attenuated,
consistent with a lack of binding to Mhp1, and no effect on conformation
(Figure S3). Thus, in the presence of Na+, all ligands that are already known to bind to Mhp1 promote
conversion of Mhp1 from the inward-facing to the outward-facing form.
This NEM-MS method could be used therefore as a rapid screen for new
ligands of transporters or for understanding allosteric switching
in other proteins. Perhaps most appealing, the quantitative and direct
readout of the population of different (NEM-accessible and -inaccessible)
states, provides advantages over other methods used for such binding
studies by avoiding the use of radioisotope-labeled candidates, reducing
the amount of protein required (compared with e.g., ITC), and the
need for protein immobilization (SPR) which can compromise function.

The failure of L-BH in the absence of Na+ to switch
the conformation of Mhp1 from inward-facing to outward-facing is particularly
significant, since measurements of tryptophan fluorescence of the
protein show that L-BH binds to the protein in the absence of added
Na+.37,47,48,51 This, in combination with the NEM-MS data
presented here, suggests that, in the absence of Na+, L-BH
binds with low affinity to the inward-facing binding site. Conversely,
in the presence of added NaCl, the measured high-affinity binding
reflects binding of L-BH to the outward-facing conformation (Figure 4a).

Figure 4 Titrations of Mhp1 with
L-BH monitored by fluorescence and titratable
effects of NEM labeling. (a) Tryptophan fluorescence quenching of
Mhp1 upon titration with L-BH, in the presence of 15 mM (green), 140
mM (magenta), and 1000 mM (blue) added NaCl. (b) Quantification of
unlabeled Mhp1 as a function of increasing [L-BH], at the same concentrations
of NaCl as those in panel a. Data are shown as mean ± SEM of
three independent measurements; additional titrations are shown in Figure S4. (c) Plot of log Km for either L-BH (blue) or Na+ (red) against
either log[L-BH] (blue) or log [Na+] (red). The slope of
the best fit line through all points was −1.09 ± 0.07,
consistent with a 1:1 Na+:L-BH stoichiometry.56

Since the isolated Mhp1 in DDM appears to be largely in the
inward-facing
conformation, it is probable that Na+ alone does not affect
the conformational distribution since the inward-facing species lacks
the Na+-binding site present in the outward-facing form
(as determined from X-ray crystallography).46,48 Indeed this conclusion is reinforced by molecular dynamics simulations,
in which bound Na+ is seen to leave the inward-facing conformation
rapidly.46

Next, we examined the
concentration dependence of L-BH and NaCl
on the extent of NEM labeling of Mhp1. Mhp1 was preincubated with
various concentrations of NaCl (15, 50, 140, 500, or 1000 mM), L-BH
was then titrated into the Mhp1-NaCl mixture, and labeling with NEM
was subsequently performed (Figure 4b). From these experiments, a hyperbolic increase in
unlabeled Mhp1 was observed as a function of L-BH concentration at
each tested NaCl concentration (examples in Figure 4b).

These data show a [L-BH]- and [NaCl]-dependent
increase in the
amount of unlabeled Mhp1 when the other ligand is present at a fixed
concentration. We fitted the data obtained to a Michaelis–Menten
binding model (Figure 4b and Figure S4), as performed for the
fluorescence titration experiments (Figure 4a), where the fitted Km value is the apparent dissociation constant, Kdapp. The binding model that was fitted to
the MS data yields Km values that are
uniformly higher than those using fluorescence (Figure S4), because the MS data reflect the ratio of all inward-facing
to outward-facing Mhp1 at all the possible concentrations of [Na+]-[BH], rather than measuring only the percent of substrate
bound, which is reflected by the change in tryptophan fluorescence.
There is no reason to expect that these values would be similar, therefore,
since different equilibria are being measured, as illustrated for
a model alternating access transport mechanism54,55 in Figures S5 and S6. Thus, each technique
provides complementary information that reveals insights into the
transport mechanism. The MS data can be replotted to demonstrate the
titratable effect of Na+ at fixed L-BH concentrations on
the inward–outward equilibrium (Figure S4). Combined, these data demonstrate a synergistic effect
of Na+ and L-BH in the transition of Mhp1 from inward-facing
to outward-facing. Using the estimated Km values from all the titrations performed for the NEM-MS experiments,
it is possible to extract the binding stoichiometry that is inducing
the conformational change by plotting log Km as a function of log(ligand concentration) (here Na+ and
L-BH; Figure 4c). These
data are consistent with a 1:1 L-BH:Na+ binding stoichiometry,
as the slope of the line of best fit is ∼1.56 For uncharacterized transporters, such an analysis may
be used to unravel the stoichiometry of binding events that lead to
conformational changes.

Susceptibility of Cys327 to Labeling by NEM
in Mhp1 Altered
by Single Residue Substitutions
In order to elucidate molecular
mechanisms of transport, single point amino acid substitutions are
often made in a protein to identify key residues in the transport
process. However, it often remains unresolved whether such mutations
alter the conformational distribution of species and/or the ability
of the protein to interconvert between inward and outward-facing forms.
A variety of mutations in Mhp1 have been made to interrogate the functional
cycle of the protein.7,47 We thus subjected a number of
these mutations to the same experimental probes used for the wild-type
protein (Figure 5).
These mutants all involved perturbing the substrate binding site of
Mhp1 (Figure 5a), resulting
in a reduction in uptake by Mhp1 and an increased Km (as determined by fluorescence).47 In most cases, mutation of residues in the L-BH binding
site resulted in a NEM-MS labeling profile (in the presence of both
L-BH and NaCl) that was comprised predominantly of singly-NEM-labeled
Mhp1 (Figure 5b and Figure S7), indicating that the protein can no
longer switch from inward-facing to outward-facing.

Figure 5 Substitutions of individual
amino acid in the ligand binding site,
affecting the labeling of Mhp1 by NEM. (a) Representation of the L-BH
binding site of Mhp1 in the inward-facing occluded state (PDB 4D1B).47 Key residues where substitutions have been made here are
labeled. L-BH is shown in green. (b) Relative abundances of unlabeled
protein (IU) relative to protein with
1 NEM label (I1NEM) in the mass spectra
for Mhp1 and selected Mhp1 variants. “WT In” corresponds
to Mhp1 in the presence of 1.25 mM 15-crown-5, and WT Out corresponds
to labeling after preincubation with 2 mM L-BH and 140 mM NaCl. For
all Mhp1 variants, labeling was performed after preincubation with
2 mM L-BH and 140 mM NaCl. Where the unmodified protein was not detected
upon labeling, the relative abundance values are displayed as ±1%,
reflecting the detection limit and signal-to-noise of the measurement
(for G219S Mhp1). Values are displayed as mean ± SEM of three
independent experiments. (c–g) Deconvoluted mass distributions
of (c) Q42F Mhp1, (d) N318A Mhp1, (e) WT Mhp1 (f) WT Mhp1 heated to
80 °C and (g) Mhp1 in the presence of 0.5 % w/v SDS after NEM
labeling in the presence of 15-crown-5 (1.25 mM).

In two instances, for the Q42F and N318A mutations, a strikingly
different pattern was observed (Figure 5c,d), where all three Cys residues were labeled. These
mutations presumably destabilize the whole protein, resulting in labeling
of all three Cys residues with NEM. Consistent with this, denaturing
conditions such as adding SDS or heating Mhp1 to 80 °C in the
presence of Na+ and L-BH led to exposure of all three Cys
residues in the protein and their consequent labeling with NEM (Figure 5e–g). It is
therefore likely that the enhanced labeling of the protein seen with
the N318A and Q42F mutants was due to (partial) unfolding of the three-dimensional
structure, so that all the Cys residues became increasingly exposed
to solvent and thus more amenable to labeling. Destabilization by
such substitutions has also been reported in two fungal transporter
homologues of Mhp1, FcyB (purine-adenine transporter), and FurD (uracil
transporter).57,58

The NEM-MS approach could
be applied to any transport protein containing
cysteine residues by incubating it with NEM, determining the labeling
fingerprint by MS, and then comparing the spectrum obtained with those
of the modified variants to determine whether any changes in conformation
are observed. Detection of unfolding does not necessarily rely on
the Cys residues being in strategically placed positions, as would
be required to monitor inward-to-outward (or the reverse) interconversion.

Conclusion
Covalent labeling, including Cys labeling using
NEM, has been used
previously to study membrane transport proteins.59 While radiolabeled NEM was used initially to monitor labeling,60−65 more recently MS strategies have been developed for such analyses.9,34,35 However, the application of such
methods to study alternating access mechanisms and ion–substrate
coupling has been limited.66 In several
instances, NEM labeling of Cys residues has been shown to inhibit
substrate binding by secondary active membrane transport proteins.64 The relatively narrow range of side-chain reactivity
of NEM has made this reagent a valuable tool for the study of membrane
protein topology, for example by scanning mutagenesis approaches.60,61 Alternative covalent labeling strategies to probe membrane protein
topology are also available, such as hydroxyl radical footprinting67−70 or hydrogen–deuterium exchange,71−73 but such applications
are limited by the need for specialized equipment, intricate workflows,
time scales available (including issues with back-exchange in hydrogen–deuterium
exchange and limited reactivity of some side chains in oxidative labeling29,67,68), and the complexity of the data
analysis. Such structural analyses, therefore, are far from routine,
especially for those interested in membrane proteins. The biochemical
and analytical methodologies employed here to study NEM-labeled membrane
proteins by MS, by contrast, are relatively simple to perform and
enable quantitation at the intact protein level, opening up the method
for application of the workflow described by a broad spectrum of biochemists
interested in studying alternating access mechanisms, substrate binding,
and ion–substrate coupling. Additionally, quantitation by MS
at the intact protein level obviates the need for protease digestion
to which many membrane proteins are refractory.74

An important, unique, feature of the NEM-MS experiments
is that
chemical modification took place after the incubation with the ligands
that were expected to affect the conformational equilibrium of the
protein. This sets the approach described apart from other methods,
e.g., FRET or EPR,7,10,75,76 which require amino acid substitution and/or
derivatization with bulky probes. Membrane proteins can be refractory
to conventional analytical methods, and the added benefit that the
analyses do not require the protein to retain its three-dimensional
structure during the MS measurements also constitutes a significant
advantage of this method.

In the case of wild-type Mhp1, one
Cys residue, Cys327, is fortuitously
in a position where conformational changes were likely to affect access
of the thiol-reactive reagent NEM. However, it is simple to introduce
Cys residues into positions known to be conformationally sensitive
and then implement the strategy described here to provide conformational
insights. General application of such an approach to other proteins,
including eukaryotic homologues of transporters that often contain
an abundance of Cys residues, may also require judicious deletion
of naturally occurring Cys residues or introduction of a Cys uniquely
sensitive to labeling in different conformational forms. Importantly,
such deletions/insertions must not alter the structure–activity
relationship of the individual protein under investigation.

From the experiments described here we show that purified wild-type
Mhp1 in DDM is in an inward-facing conformation and remains so when
either a hydantoin substrate or Na+ is added, but changes
to outward-facing when the two are added together in a concentration-dependent
manner. This alone is an important constraint when attempting to understand
the individual steps of the transport cycle. Equally as important
is that our experiments have illuminated the effects of single residue
substitutions on the conformational state of the protein. While only
a small number of examples are given here, a wide range of single
residue mutations of Mhp1 have been generated for study.47 Previously, information on the conformation
of the protein required crystallographic structure determination,
often impossible due to the perturbation(s) imposed by the mutation
itself, highlighting the power of NEM-MS for a simple readout and
quantification of the different conformational states of the protein
ensemble.

For Mhp1, three conformationally different structures
were identified
by crystallography,46−48 but in a more likely scenario, for other proteins
for which only a single structure is available, the MS-based strategy
described here could be implemented to discriminate hypotheses about
conformational changes, to identify residues important for structural
maintenance, and to screen a number of variants quickly. Even when
no structure is available, a model of the structure of any protein
and its conformational flexibility could be tested using the strategy
described, which requires only microgram quantities of protein and
provides rapid insights about the relative population of different
conformational states that is not possible using crystallography.

In the case of Mhp1 it was not necessarily anticipated that the
protein would remain in the inward-facing state in DDM micelles when
either L-BH or Na+ were present, nor that very high concentrations
of Na+ would be necessary to drive the change from inward-facing
to outward-facing. Moreover, it was previously unknown which mutations
would affect the balance of conformations, nor which ones would promote
unfolding/denaturing of its structure. These are all important observations
that, alongside others,7,36,39,46,47,77 illuminate our understanding of the complete reaction
cycle of this transport protein. For many other transporters, and
indeed for any protein, the NEM-MS strategy described can be readily
implemented to interrogate conformational transitions, elucidate ion–substrate
coupling stoichiometry, screen widely for ligand specificity and illuminate
mechanistic features that have eluded characterization to date.
