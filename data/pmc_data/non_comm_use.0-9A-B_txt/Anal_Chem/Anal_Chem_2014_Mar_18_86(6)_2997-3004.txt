Currently, there are no reliable ex vivo models
that predict anticancer drug responses in human tumors accurately.
A comprehensive method of mimicking a 3D microenvironment to study
effects of anticancer drugs on specific cancer types is essential.
Here, we report the development of a three-dimensional microfluidic
cell array (3D μFCA), which reconstructs a 3D tumor microenvironment
with cancer cells and microvascular endothelial cells. To mimic the in vivo spatial relationship between microvessels and nonendothelial
cells embedded in extracellular matrix, three polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) layers were built into this array. The multilayer property
of the device enabled the imitation of the drug delivery in a microtissue
array with simulated blood circulation. This 3D μFCA system
may provide better predictions of drug responses and identification
of a suitable treatment for a specific patient if biopsy samples are
used. To the pharmaceutical industry, the scaling-up of our 3D μFCA
system may offer a novel high throughput screening tool.

==== Body
The in vivo microenvironment of mammalian cells possesses some
common characteristics
such as continuous nutrient supply and waste removal, maintenance
of an appropriate temperature, short distance between cells and microvessels,
cell–cell communication, minimal surrounding stress, and the
ratio of cell volume to the extracellular fluid volume greater than
one.1,2 However, current in vitro cell culture techniques used in clinical and pharmaceutical drug
screening or discovery neither provide these conditions nor simulate
the three-dimensional (3D) in vivo microenvironment
of mammalian cells simultaneously. Although the static 3D cell culture
mimics in vivo complexity at some levels, main limitations
of these culture systems include fast nutrient and O2 depletion
as well as accumulation of metabolites and waste products due to lack
of a circulatory mechanism. On the other hand, animal models often
provide good results of drug pharmacokinetics but seldom yield reliable
outcomes of drug efficacy in human beings.3 In the cases of anticancer drug development and clinical screening
of patient-specific anticancer drugs, lack of accurate 3D in vitro cell/tissue models becomes a bottleneck.

The process of tumor progression is influenced by the communication
between the tumor cells and the surrounding cells. Therefore, mimicking
the microenvironment of tumor cells is essential to study tumor growth
and regression.4,5 Angiogenesis and metastasis are
dependent on the tumor microenvironment. The continuity of cancer
growth relies on continuous angiogenesis and tumor cell invasion into
other organs via blood vessels.6,7 The conventional 2D
cell culture environment causes cancer cells to adopt unnaturally
spreading morphology, while cancer cells in 3D culture embrace rounded
and clustered morphology similar to tumors in vivo.4,8 Different drug sensitivities were observed for cells
grown as a 2D monolayer compared with the same cells grown in 3D culture
configurations.9,10 The growth rate of tumor cells
in the 3D environment reflects in vivo tumor growth
better than that in the 2D environment5· Static 3D cell culture techniques lack the engineered
microvessels necessary to closely mimic the in vivo 3D microenvironment.

Miniaturization of a conventional cell
culture system with microfluidic
technologies provides an opportunity to model a three-dimensional
physiological or pathological environment. A wide range of conditions
(e.g., multiple drugs) can be screened simultaneously with high yield
on such a platform. Using reverse transfection and a robotic spotter,
the first cell microarray for 2D cell culture was developed by the
Sabatini group.11,12 When it is used for drug screening
and drug action mechanism discovery, this type of cell microarray
generates an enormous volume of data from one compound screening at
one condition due to the lack of microfluidic systems. To overcome
this limitation, several versions of microfluidic cell arrays for
2D monolayer cell culture were developed with13,14 or without15−18 microvalves. Their potential applications were demonstrated broadly
from stem cell culture18 and differentiation13 to dynamic gene expression profiling.14 However, these microfluidic cell arrays could
not accommodate three-dimensional cell cultures, which are essential
to mimic an in vivo microenvironment.

Recognizing
the inherent laminar flow generated in microfluidic
channels, researchers have been able to culture cells encapsulated
in 3D matrix on one side of a microchannel and allow fluid flow on
the other side of the channel.19 However,
the device with side-by-side 3D culture and flow in the same microchannel
without the array architecture is not readily amendable for high throughput
screening assays. Additionally, 3D cell microarrays without fluidic
components have been reported with an array of cell and matrix droplets
created by a robotic spotter and cultured on a glass slide.20,21 Without a simulated microcirculation system, these 3D cell microarrays
were unlikely able to closely mimic the in vivo 3D
microenvironment for high throughput drug screening.

In this
study, we developed a 3D microfluidic cell array (μFCA)
consisting of three PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) layers to model in vivo microenvironment. The parametric study using computational
fluid dynamics simulation was performed on the designed geometric
variables based on three-dimensional microfluidic cell array (3D μFCA)
to study their effects on the profiles of flow and nutrient delivery.
The three-layer design enabled 3D hydrogel encapsulation cell culture
in an array of microchambers adjacent to multiple separated microchannels
seeded with endothelial cells to serve as bioartificial blood vessels.
Using this technology, multiple stimuli including clinical and potential
anticancer drugs were applied on a 3D microtumor array on a single
chip to measure dynamic responses of apoptotic activities. This study
has thus established a potentially high throughput screening method
that combines microfluidic technology and 3D cell culture techniques
to monitor the dynamic responses of potential or clinical anticancer
drugs in a simulated 3D microenvironment with microcirculation.

Experimental
Section
3D microfluidic cell array (μFCA) consists
of: (i) microchannels
to simulate blood microvessels, (ii) microchambers in a different
layer for 3D cell culturing in extracellular matrix, and (iii) a membrane
with clustered pores at specific locations to guide the diffusion
in between the layers of microchannels and microchambers. Thus, nutrient
supply and waste removal for cells encapsulated 3D matrix are maintained
via diffusion from and to a continuous flow of fresh medium in the
microchannels. Soft lithography was used to fabricate each layer with
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Briefly, silicon etching was employed
in master making of three layers. A set of food color dyes was used
to verify the diffusion from the top to bottom layers through clustered
pores in the middle layer on a 3D μFCA. The detailed methods
of the device manufacture and testing are explained in Supporting Information I (ac403899j_si_001.pdf).

A computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation was performed in
FLUENT (Ansys, Inc.) to investigate the theoretical similarity of
dynamic cell culture conditions maintained by the 3D μFCA microchambers
to interstitial flow conditions in vivo. The studied
geometry was a cross section of one unit on the device along the thickness
with three parts, one microchamber, one group of pores, and one microchannel.
Detailed procedures of computational modeling are explained in Supporting Information II (ac403899j_si_002.pdf).

Three types of cells were used in this study, human ductal breast
epithelial tumor cell line (T47D), human non-small cell lung cancer
cell line (PC9), and adult human dermal blood microvascular endothelial
cells (HMVEC). Cancer cells were encapsulated using PuraMatrix hydrogel
in its viscous liquid form and flowed into the bottom microchambers
of a 3D μFCA, followed by cell growth medium in the top channels
to trigger the gel polymerization in the bottom. No visible cell density
variations were observed in the different microchambers when the cell
density of the cell–gel mixture was the same. Cell culture
was maintained by continuous flow in the top channel using a syringe
pump. Short and long-term cell viability in our μFCA was evaluated
using calcein AM, a fluorescence live cell dye. Structured coculture
between PC9 and HMVECs in a 3D μFCA was achieved by seeding
HMVECs in the top microchannels following the seeding of PC9 cells
in hydrogel in the bottom microchambers. In the case of coculture,
cancer cells were dyed with DiI, a red fluorescence long term cell
tracker. Four apoptotic inducers (i.e., Tarceva, staurosporine, TNF-α,
and colchicines) were applied to compare the caspase-3 activities
of PC9 cell cultures in conventional culture dishes with that in the
3D microenvironment generated in a 3D μFCA. Caspase-3 activities
were measured using DEVD-Nucview 488, a green fluorescence probe to
detect activated caspase-3. Detailed materials and methods related
to biological experiments in this study are explained in Supporting Information I (ac403899j_si_001.pdf).

A fully automated epi-fluorescence microscope equipped with an
objective moving in the z direction and a stage controller
of temperature and CO2 were used to take wide-field z-stack fluorescence images for 3D cell culture. Time-lapse
of 3D images were taken during the drug treatment. Quantitative fluorescence
image analysis was performed after deconvolution of 3D z-stack images. The detailed methods of 3D image capture and analysis
are explained in Supporting Information I (ac403899j_si_001.pdf).

Results
The tumor microenvironment
with blood vessels illustrated in Figure 1a,b
was modeled using a bioengineering approach
via a layered microstructure (Figure 1c). In
order to be able to scale up for future high throughput drug screening,
the array concept was included as illustrated in Figure 1d. Figure 1e is the schematic drawing
of a cross-section view of a 3D μFCA with an endothelial cell
layer over the filter layer to mimic the physical 3D in vivo structure.

The bottom layer has microchambers with cancer cells embedded in hydrogel.
The middle layer is a permeable membrane with clustered pores. The
upper layer has microchannels with seeded endothelial cells to simulate
blood microvessels.

Operation of the 3D μFCA
Figure 2a is a merged image of AutoCAD drawings
of all three masks
for: (i) the top layer with 8 white straight microchannels, (ii) the
middle porous layer with 64 groups of micropores represented by purple
stars, and (iii) the bottom layer including 64 microchambers in green.
In order to show the features in top and bottom layers clearly, different
food colors were introduced in a 3D μFCA with a nonpermeable
PDMS middle layer. Features dyed with blue and green are in the bottom
layer while red and yellow microchannels are on the top (Figure 2b). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of
masters of three layers show that the diameter of microchambers is
770 μm (Figure 2c) and the pore size
on the middle filter layer (Figure 2d,e) is
40 μm. The large pore size was chosen aiming to hold the endothelial
cells atop the tumor mass while permitting the maximum exchange of
nutrients and waste products. The vasculature of growing tumors is
known to be very porous compared to normal vasculurate.22 In a 3D μFCA, pores are grouped and positioned
so that they are right above the microchambers when the bottom microchamber
layer is permanently bonded with the middle PDMS porous layer. The
top layer (Figure 2f) is composed of 790 μm
wide microchannels. The microchannel width is close to the upper range
(>500 μm) of pulmonary vessel’s diameter.23

a 5× phase contrast objective showing (h1) three PDMS
layers bonded on a glass slide (“M” indicates the middle

in the middle layer in a dry brush processed image using Photoshop.

One of the main operations in
a 3D μFCA is diffusion between
different layers of the device. Such diffusive transport is critical
for communication among cells in different layers. For this purpose,
the diffusion efficiency was tested between layers using a set of
food dyes. Figure 2g includes four frames of
a video captured during the top-to-bottom-layer diffusion test. When
food dyes were introduced through inlets of the top layer with closed
inlets and outlets of the bottom layer, food dyes reached to the bottom
layer within 5 s (Figure 2g). These results
verified that the middle PDMS layer was porous and diffusion from
top to the bottom layer occurred in seconds. The clustered pores in
the middle layer enabling this guided diffusion between top and bottom
layers are displayed in Figure 2h, which shows
the cross-section (i.e., side-view) of one unit of a 3D μFCA
including three PDMS layers on a glass substrate to visually capture
the three-dimensional feature of the device.

Diffusion and Microcirculation
Profile Using Computational Fluid
Dynamics (CFD) Analysis
Simulation data conclude that vertical
diffusion between different layers plus convection flow in the top
microchannels is sufficient for nutrient delivery and waste removal
in the 3D μFCA. There is an extremely low advective flow at
∼0.1 μm/s in the bottom microchamber without hypoxia.
The decrease in O2 concentrations from the microchannel
inlet to bottom right corner of the same microchamber is less than
0.0003%. With 10 to 100 microchambers in a serial connection, there
will be no hypoxia in the last microchamber in our current device
with the microchamber thickness of 100 μm. However, hypoxia
conditions in the late stage of tumors can be mimicked by increasing
the thickness of microchambers in the future. Detailed results including
a figure of computational modeling are explained in Supporting Information II (ac403899j_si_002.pdf).

Reconstructed
3D Cell Images from z-Stack Epi-fluorescence
Images via Deconvolution
To evaluate the imaging ability
of 3D live cell culture in a 3D μFCA using an epi-fluorescence
microscope equipped with an objective moving in the z-direction, lung cancer cells were dyed with a green fluorescent
long-term cell tracker before hydrogel encapsulation and then cultured
in the microchambers of the bottom layer of the device for two weeks
with initial cell seeding density of 10 million/mL. Using 1 μm
per z-slice over cell aggregates of 70 to 80 μm
in depth, deconvolution results are shown in Figure 3, which includes a projected image (Figure 3b) and the reconstructed 3D image (Figure 3c) of cancer cell aggregates cultured in a chamber of the
3D μFCA on day 15.

and z (thickness from bottom to top) directions.

High Cell Culture Viability
in the 3D μFCA
Short
and long-term cell viability in a 3D μFCA is essential for accurate
drug screening. For a one week culture in a 3D μFCA, viability
of breast cancer T47D cells with initial cell seeding density of 10
million/mL on Day 7 is shown in Figure 4a,
which includes a 10× phase contrast image of T47D cells encapsulated
in PuraMatrix and fluorescence images of cells at 0, 22, and 52 s
after the calcein AM introduction in top microchannels. Vertical diffusion
of calcein AM from top microchannels to bottom microchambers was indicated
by the fluorescence green signal observed as early as 22 s. At 52
s, most of the cells were fluorescence green demonstrating high cell
viability in the 3D μFCA. In the long term viability test, PC9
cells were stained with DiI red fluorescence cell tracker before hydrogel
encapsulation and seeding in a 3D μFCA with initial cell seeding
density of 60 million/mL. Figure 4b shows phase
contrast and fluorescence images of DiI stained PC9 cells on Day 1,
7, and 13. The gradual increase of red fluorescence signal indicates
the cell growth in the device (Figure 4c).
High cell viability assessed by calcein AM on Day 13 for the long-term
culture in the device is also shown in Figure 4c, which is a three-dimensional reconstructed green fluorescence
image deconvoluted from a stack of PC9 cell images captured after
calcein AM staining.

Microtumor Cell Aggregates with Mimicked Microvessels in a 3D
μFCA
Structured coculture between DiI prestained cancer
cells and microvascular endothelial cells in a 3D μFCA is shown
by phase contrast and corresponding fluorescence images in Figure 5. A fluorescence red cancer cell aggregate is presented
in a microchamber in bottom-focused images (Figure 5b) while monolayer endothelial cells indicated by arrows are
clearly pictured in the top-focused phase contrast image (Figure 5c). Thus, a microchannel with endothelial cells
serves as a biomimicked microvessel, and the middle PDMS membrane
with clustered micropores ensures the diffusion-controlled transport
of metabolites and the communication between cancer cells and their
microenvironment. Anticancer reagents have to diffuse through the
mimicked microvessels and then reach tumor mass, which is a scenario
much closer to in vivo drug delivery.

cells.

Profiles of Caspase-3 Activity
in Different Culture Configurations
We demonstrated the potential
of the 3D μFCA for dynamic
anticancer drug screening by monitoring apoptotic response to clinical
or potential anticancer drugs. Figure 6a includes
representative time-lapse fluorescence images showing caspase-3 activities
in PC9 cells in conventional static 2D cultures treated with Tarceva
(Tar), staurosporine (Sta), TNF-α with cycloheximide (TNF-α/CHX),
colchicine (Col), and caspase-3 inhibitors (Cas 3 In) at 0, 3, and
17 h of stimulation. Results of quantitative fluorescence image analysis
in Figure 6b show that there is a rapid increase
of active caspase-3 in PC9 cells treated by three drugs (Tarceva,
staurosporine, and TNF-α with cycloheximide) in the early stage
of stimulation, followed by a graduated elevation of activated caspase-3
along the stimulation. However, responses to colchicine are much slower
and lower than the other three drugs until 12 h after drug stimulations.
At 17 h, the staurosporine treatment led to the highest caspase-3
activity followed by TNF-α/CHX, colchicine, and Tarceva, in
descending order.

culture conditions. (a) Fluorescence images of drug treated PC9 cells

(g) 3D conventional coculture of PC9/HMVEC, and (h) structural coculture

The dynamics of drug responses in conventional static 3D
PC9 encapsulation
cultures (Figure 6c) or PC9/microvascular endothelial
cell cocultures (Figure 6d) are very different
from that of 2D cultures. Comparison of 2D (Figure 6b) and 3D (Figure 6c) PC9 alone cultures
shows that caspase-3 activities were lower in the 3D encapsulation
culture. Interestingly, both the static 3D encapsulation cultures
(Figure 6c,d) had higher drug responses in
the early stage of stimulation rather than the late stage. This phenomenon
is vividly demonstrated in Figure 6f,g, which
are representative 3D reconstructed images of PC9 cultures and PC9/endothelium
cocultures in peptide hydrogel stimulated by Tarceva, respectively.

In the 3D μFCA culture condition, endothelial and PC9 cells
are structurally cocultured in different layers but communicate with
each other through clustered micropores in the middle PDMS membrane
in between. In drug treated samples, caspase-3 activities increase
slowly but steadily until 6 h when they reach the highest level (Figure 6e). This is followed by a slight decrease afterward.
Figure 6h is representative 3D reconstructed
images of caspase-3 activities of cocultures in a 3D μFCA under
the stimulation of Tarceva. Comparison of Figure 6d,e demonstrated that cells in structured cocultures using
mimicked in vivo microenvironment have slower and
lower maximum drug responses than the static 3D random coculture where
cells experience drugs directly. The maximum drug response in structured
cocultures in a 3D μFCA was reached at 6 h vs 3 h in the unstructured
static 3D coculture in tissue culture plates. We speculate that the
endothelium formed in the top microchannels worked as a drug barrier
layer to delay the drug delivery.

Discussion
In
this study, we demonstrated that high viabilities of short (Figure 4a) and long-term (Figure 4b) cancer 3D cultures could be achieved in our 3D μFCA using
different initial cell seeding densities (i.e., 10 and 60 million/mL).
Tumor tissues have a wide range of cellularity from 10% to 90% depending
on cancer types and stages.24−27 The seeding density of 60 million/mL in the bottom
microchambers of our current 3D μFCA gives about 90% cellularity.
For a purpose of drug screening, different cell seeding densities
in a 3D μFCA can be used to achieve the simulation of different
stages of cancer. Additionally, using this 3D μFCA, lung cancer
cells grown as microtumor aggregates in microchambers were structurally
cocultured with endothelial cells in microchannels mimicking microvessels
under continuous flow to simulate blood circulation (Figure 5). The efficacy of anticancer drugs in terms of
their effects on apoptosis of cancer cells was evaluated in the 3D
μFCA coculture system (Figure 6e,h).
In addition, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation showed
that the 3D μFCA created a microenvironment for cells where
the mechanical stresses are extremely low with about 0.1 μm/s
flow velocity in cell microchambers and the nutrients and waste products
were efficiently transported via diffusion and extremely low convection
(Supporting Information II, Figure 1 (ac403899j_si_002.pdf)).

Conventional cell culture techniques for drug screening are dominated
by 2D cell culture. Recently introduced 3D cell culture techniques
showed the significant impacts of the 3D tumor structure on cellular
microenvironments on cell growth, cell morphology, gene profile, and
drug sensitivities.28,29 Previous microfluidic devices
designed potentially for high throughput drug screening were focused
on 2D monolayer cell culture.11,13,14,16−18 However, it
is essential to mimic in vivo conditions to obtain
realistic results of biological processes.30,31 In the previous systems, cancer cells were seeded directly inside
microchannels or microchambers without 3D extracellular matrix, so
cells are in direct contact with fluid flow.14,16,17,32 Such direct
flow applies shear stresses on cells which are not present in vivo except for endothelial cells and duct epithelial
cells (e.g., alveolar and kidney epithelial cells). A simplified kidney
chip and lung chip used mechanical stresses provided by microfluidic
systems in the design.33,34 However, diffusion is the main
transport mechanism in vivo between tissues and microvessels
or capillaries. The 3D μFCA realized the diffusion process for
the transportation of nutrients, metabolic waste products, and other
molecules by the three layer structure. The flow velocity of 0.1 μm/s
in microchambers of a 3D μFCA obtained by the CFD simulation
is similar to the in vivo interstitial flow, which
is 0.1–1 μm/s.35

On
the other hand, employing the laminar flow property of microfluidic
channels and micropillars as barriers, a microfluidic device was managed
to have cells embedded in 3D matrix at the center of a channel and
medium flow at both sides of the same channel.36,37 Lateral diffusion in the same channel maintained 3D cell culture.
However, this microfluidic system would allow low throughput measurements.
Using our 3D μFCA, real time measurements of multiple drug responses
in different types of cancer cells cultured in a 3D microenvironment
with simulated blood vessels could be recorded in single experiments
on single chips (Figure 6). Furthermore, by
changing the bonding orientation between the top microchannel layer
and the bottom microchamber layer from currently parallel to orthogonal
alignments, the second generation of 3D μFCA will be a powerful
tool for high throughput drug screening with closely mimicked 3D microenvironment
in an array format. Different strategies including adding microvalves
are under investigation to prevent drug leakage between microchambers.

In this study, direct visualization and quantitative analysis of
apoptotic responses via caspase-3 activities in PC9 cells cocultured
with HMVECs in 3D μFCA and exposed to four anticancer drugs
were a confirmation of the system versatility for potential high throughput
drug screening (Figure 6). Dynamic caspase-3
activities in PC9 cells showed that cancer cells had different drug
responses in different culture platforms, such as static 2D or 3D
culture, static 3D coculture, and structured 3D cocultured in the
3D μFCA with simulated blood vessels. In the conventional static
culture conditions, PC9 cells had greater drug responses in 2D monolayer
culture than that of cancer cells embedded in 3D matrix (Figure 6b,c). Studies from other researchers also showed
different drug responses of cancer cells depending on the cell culture
environment.4,38 Interestingly, static 3D coculture
between PC9 cells and HMVECs brought the low drug responses back to
a similar level as the 2D monolayer culture (Figure 6b,d). This result indicates that drug responses are dependent
on the 3D microenvironment and cells themselves. Therefore, it is
essential to construct an in vitro system to mimic
an in vivo tumor microenvironment including proper
cell types in order to obtain reliable anticancer drug responses in
drug screening.

The drug response results of the current static
3D environment
are not reliable due to the lack of a circulation mechanism to remove
the waste products and toxic byproducts. This was confirmed by the
different dynamic (e.g., slower and reduced) drug responses in the
structured coculture of lung cancer cells with microvascular endothelial
cells in our 3D μFCA compared with the static random coculture
(Figure 6d,e). We speculate that the attenuated
and delayed drug responses from PC9 and cocultures in our 3D μFCA
are caused by a HMVEC monolayer formed in the top layer of the device,
shown in Figure 5c. Several experimental optimization
and measurements related to the top endothelial layer need to be performed
to achieve microvessels as close to in vivo as possible.
For example, the seeding density of HMVECs and length of the HMVEC
culture before drug testing need to be optimized by matching diffusive
permeability of top endothelial layer to in vivo data.
The diffusive permeability can be measured using fluorescence labeled
dextran molecules.39 In addition, tight
junctions between HMVECs can be verified by VE-cadherin immunostaining.39 Once the top endothelial layer is fully optimized,
analog phenomena to tumor angiogenesis and metastasis can be studied
in our 3D microfluidic cell arrays.

Although an attempt to construct
a layered microfluidic device
was made by stacking a microchannel layer on top of a two-microchamber
layer with an opaque polyester membrane in the middle,40 this design is not suitable for scaling up to
an array structure for high throughput drug screening due to the leakage
possibility across neighboring microchambers/channels caused by the
property of nonselective perfusion directions of the polyester membrane,
which is permeable vertically and laterally. The nontransparent semipermeable
membrane makes fast imaging of 3D cell culture in different layers
extremely difficult without confocal microscopy, which is not commonly
used in high throughput drug screening due to its slow scanning speed.
Our 3D μFCA is a pure PDMS device to overcome limitations mentioned
above.

Our novel 3D microfluidic cell arrays established an in
vitro microtumor/tissue array to mimic an in vivo 3D microenvironment with simulated blood vessels. Furthermore, integration
of techniques of microvalve and cell seeding without tubing into the
current design will open the possibility for high-throughput analysis
and clinical translation. Evidence shows that cancer cell behavior,
including progression and drug resistance, is affected by its host
microenvironment consisting of direct contact with tumor stroma and
soluble factors secreted from tumor stroma.41,42 Therefore, other types of stromal cells besides endothelial cells
(e.g., fibroblasts) in tumor tissues will be incorporated in the next
generation of our 3D microfluidic cell arrays (μFCA). On the
other hand, thin (about 250 μm in thickness)43,44 and thick (1–2 mm in thickness)45−47 tissue slides
have been cultured successfully in nonarray-format microfluidic devices
with perfusion for hours to a couple of days depending on tissue types.
This encourages us to further modify our 3D μFCA to accommodate
tissue samples (e.g., biopsy tissues) directly instead of performing
3D tissue reconstruction in our next model. It will lead to the clinical
applications of using our 3D μFCA to search for more effective
and personalized medicine in cancer treatments.

In summary,
our 3D microfluidic cell array (3D μFCA) provides
a novel technology to mimic an in vivo 3D microenvironment
using an ex vivo platform that is readily amendable
to screen anticancer drugs for a personalized therapy or to scale
up for high throughput drug screening in the pharmaceutical industry.
