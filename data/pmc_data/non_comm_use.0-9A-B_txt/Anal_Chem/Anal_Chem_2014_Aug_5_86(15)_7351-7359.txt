We
report a rapid and highly sensitive approach based on gold-nanoparticle-decorated
silica nanorods (GNP-SiNRs) label and lateral-flow strip biosensor
(LFSB) for visually detecting proteins. Owing to its biocompatibility
and convenient surface modification, SiNRs were used as carriers to
load numerous GNPs, and the GNP-SiNRs were used as labels for the
lateral-flow assay. The LFSB detection limit was lowered 50 times
compared to the traditional GNP-based lateral-flow assay. Rabbit IgG
was used as a model target to demonstrate the proof-of-concept. Sandwich-type
immunoreactions were performed on the immunochromatographic strips,
and the accumulation of GNP-SiNRs on the test zone produced the characteristic
colored bands, enabling visual detection of proteins without instrumentation.
The quantitative detection was performed by reading the intensities
of the colored bands with a portable strip reader. The response of
the optimized device was highly linear for the range of 0.05–2
ng mL–1, and the detection limit was estimated to
be 0.01 ng mL–1. The GNP-SiNR-based LFSB, thus,
offered an ultrasensitive method for rapidly detecting trace amounts
of proteins. This method has a potential application with point-of-care
screening for clinical diagnostics and biomedical research.

Sensitive
detection of proteins
is of tremendous interest for a broad range of applications, such
as clinical diagnosis, food safety, and environmental analysis.1−5 A variety of strategies and techniques has been developed to detect
proteins, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western
blot, agarose and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunosensors
in connection with various transducers.6−14 The assay sensitivities were further enhanced by using nanomaterials
(nanoparticles, nanowires, and nanotubes)15−18 and novel signal-amplification
approaches.19−22 However, most nanomaterial-based signal-amplification methods generally
involved a time-consuming detection process or advanced laboratory
equipment. Lateral-flow immunoassay (LFI), also called immunochromatographic
assay, has been studied extensively for different applications, such
as pregnancy tests as well as detecting cancer biomarkers, infectious
agents, and biowarfare agents.23,24 In a typical LFI, the
antibody-modified marco-nano-particles move along the strip with the
analytes driven by capillary force and are eventually captured by
the preimmobilized antibodies in the test zone. The captured marco-nano-particles,
which are proportional to the target concentrations, can be determined
by observing the color changes for the test band or by recording the
fluorescence, electrical, or magnetic signals with appropriate transducers.25,26 Gold nanoparticles (GNPs),27−29 carbon nanoparticles,30 quantum dots,31−33 Fe3O4 nanoparticles,34 etc. have been
used as labels to develop LFIs. Although the fluorescent, magnetic,
and electrical LFIs offered high sensitivity, the requirements for
instrumentation and skilled personnel limit their point-of-care or
in-field applications. Among the aforementioned colored particles
used for LFI, GNPs are the most applicable materials due to their
unique optical properties (plasma absorption), remarkable chemical
stability, and easy surface modification. The GNP-based LFIs have
been applied for the qualitative and semiquantitative/quantitative
detection of proteins,35 metal ions,36 and natural toxins.37 Most reported LFIs for protein analysis were established with detection
limits ranging from μg mL–1 (nanomolar) to
ng mL–1 (picomolar).38−42 However, cancer protein biomarker detection and early
diagnosis of disease often require a pg mL–1 (fetomolar)
detection limit.43−45 Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop an ultrasensitive
LFI for visually detecting proteins.

Recently, great efforts
have been made to improve the sensitivity
of the GNP-based LFIs by using a dual-labeling method. Choi et al.
reported a dual-GNP conjugate-based lateral-flow assay method to analyze
Troponin I.46 The first GNP conjugate was
prepared with an antibody against Troponin I. The second GNP conjugate
was designed to bind with the first GNP conjugate and thus resulted
in a larger size to improve the detection limit. The detection sensitivity
increased about 100-fold compared to the conventional LFI. Mei et
al. reported a sensitivity-enhanced LFI based on the same concept
using different-sized GNPs for the visual detection of bisphenol A.47 The LFI detection limit was 10 times lower compared
to the traditional GNP-based assay. He et al. reported an ultrasensitive
lateral-flow strip biosensor (LFSB) based on horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-GNP dual labels.48 Deposition of
an insoluble, enzymatic catalytic product (red-colored chromogen)
on the captured GNPs at the LFSB test zone offered a dramatic visual
enhancement. Combining enzyme catalytic amplification with the unique
optical properties of GNPs, the LFSB was capable of detecting 0.01
pM of target DNA without instrumentation. Tang et al. found that using
magnetic GNP labels lowered the detection limit 3-fold for aflatoxin
B2 compared to a conventional immunodipstick test using
GNPs as colored reagents.49

Inspired
by the signal amplification methods, the composite nanomaterial,
formed by numerous GNPs evenly coated on a single substrate, would
be an ideal colored reagent to enhance the LFSB sensitivity. Several
materials, including carbon nanotubes and polymers,50−53 were used as substrates to prepare
the composite nanomaterials. However, most of the composite nanomaterials
involved complicated or strict synthetic procedures. Silica-based
nanomaterials (nanoparticles, nanowires, and nanorods) have attracted
considerable interest in biomedical research because of their unique
properties, such as inertness, high payload capacity, biocompatibility,
and great surface modification.54 The silica-based
nanomaterials have been utilized to develop highly sensitive biosensors
and bioassays.55−58 In this paper, we report an ultrasensitive protein assay using a
gold-nanoparticle-decorated silica nanorod (GNP-SiNR) label and a
LFSB. Silica nanorod was chosen as a matrix to make the GNP-SiNR hybrid.
A large number of GNPs on a single SiNR provided a purple color that
was much darker than the pure GNP solution. The nanohybrid, instead
of GNP, was used as a colored reagent in LFSB. Rabbit IgG was used
as a model target to demonstrate the proof-of-concept. A pair of antibodies
capable of specifically recognizing rabbit IgG was used to prepare
the LFSB (Figure 1). Capture antibody was immobilized
on the test zone of the LFSB, and report antibody was conjugated with
GNP-SiNR hybrid (Ab-GNP-SiNR). Rabbit IgG interacted with Ab-GNP-SiNR
to form rabbit IgG-Ab-GNP-SiNR complex and continued to move along
the strip. Accumulation of GNP-SiNR on the test zone produced a visible
dark-purple band, which could be used for either qualitative or quantitative
detection of rabbit IgG by a portable strip reader. Under the optimal
conditions, a detection limit of 0.01 ng mL–1 (10
pg mL–1) was obtained. The promising properties
of the GNP-SiNR-based LFSB are reported in the following sections.

Experimental Section
Apparatus
A Hitachi SU8010 field
scanning-electron
microscope (SEM; Tokyo, Japan) was used to take images of the developed
nanocomposites. The elemental analysis was obtained by performing
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDS) measurements (Oxford X-Max;
Concord, MA, USA), and the spectrometer was attached to a Hitachi
SU8010 field-emission SEM. A Shimadzu UV–vis spectrometer (Columbia, MD, USA) was
used to obtain the absorption spectra of the nanomaterials. An Airjet
AJQ 3000 dispenser, Biojet BJQ 3000 dispenser, Clamshell Laminator,
and the Guillotine cutting-module CM 4000 purchased from Biodot LTD
(Irvine, CA, USA) were used to prepare lateral-flow strips. A portable
strip reader DT1030 (Shanghai Goldbio Tech. Co.; Shanghai, China)
was used for signal recording.

Materials
Tetraethylorthosilicate
(TEOS, 98%) was purchased
from Acros Organics (NJ, USA). Sodium citrate (Na3Ct),
gold(III) chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O, 99.9+%), hydroxylamine hydrochloride (98%, ACS grade), sodium
borohydride (NaBH4, >98%), Na3PO4·12H2O, sucrose, Tween 20, Triton X-100, phosphate
buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.01 M), phosphate buffer saline with
0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Ammonium hydroxide
(NH4OH, 28.0%–30.0%), potassium carbonate (K2CO3·1.5 H2O, ACS grade), and ethanol
(95%) were obtained from Fisher Scientific Co. (Pittsburgh, PA, USA).
Polyvinylpyrrolidone molecule (PVP; average molecular weight Mn = 40 000) and 1-pentanol (99+%, ACS
grade) were purchased from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA, USA). Rabbit
IgG, goat antirabbit IgG (Ab1), and mouse antigoat IgG
(Ab2) were obtained from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL,
USA). Glass fibers (GFCP000800), cellulose-fiber sample pads (CFSP001700),
laminated cards (HF000MC100), and nitrocellulose membranes (HFB18004)
were provided by Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA). All chemicals were
analytical reagent grade unless specified. All buffer solutions were
prepared using ultrapure water (>18 MΩ cm) from a Millipore
Milli-Q water purification system.

Preparation of Silica Nanorods
(SiNRs)
A one-step synthetic
method was used to prepare SiNRs. In a typical synthetic procedure,
a total of 3.00 g of PVP was added to 30.00 mL of 1-pentanol. The
mixture was sonicated for 30 min to obtain a well-mixed PVP/pentanol
solution. Then, 3.00 mL of 95% ethanol, 0.84 mL of H2O,
and 0.20 mL of 0.17 M Na3Ct were added to the PVP/pentanol
mixture, followed by hand-shaking for a few seconds. After the addition
of 0.30 mL of TEOS and 0.50 mL of NH4OH, the reaction was
allowed to proceed overnight at room temperature. The SiNRs were collected
by centrifuging at 11 000 rpm for 30 min and removing the supernatant.
The collected SiNRs were washed 3 times with ethanol and dried in
the oven at 100 °C.

Preparation of Gold Seeds
Typically,
4.00 mL of 1%
HAuCl4 solution was added to 100.00 mL of H2O in an ice bath, followed by the addition of 0.50 mL of 0.20 M K2CO3 to reduce Au(III) to Au(I). The solution is
then stirred for 10 min until its color changes from yellow to light
yellow or colorless. Then, 1.00 mL of freshly prepared NaBH4 (0.50 mg/mL) was slowly added. The formation of a reddish solution
indicated the successful synthesis of gold seeds.

Preparation
of Gold-Nanoparticle-Decorated Silica Nanorods (GNP-SiNRs)
The GNP-SiNRs were prepared according to the reported methods with
slight modifications.59 An aliquot with
1.00 mL of 10.00 mg/mL SiNR solution was added to a 40.00 mL gold-seed
solution, and the mixture was stirred vigorously for 20 min. Surplus
gold seeds were removed by centrifugation at a speed of 6500 rpm for
15 min. The obtained reddish precipitate was gold-seed-decorated SiNRs
and was redispersed in 10.00 mL of water for the gold-shell growth
process. In the gold-shell growth process, 4.00 mL of 1% HAuCl4 solution and 0.025 g of K2CO3 were
added to 90.00 mL of water. The mixture was stirred until it turned
to light yellow or colorless. Then, 10.00 mL of a gold-seed-decorated
SiNR solution, 1.00 mL of 0.5 M hydroxylamine hydrochloride, and 1.00
g of PVP were sequentially added to the growth solution. After overnight
reaction, the solution was centrifuged at a speed of 6500 rpm for
15 min and was washed 3 times with water. Finally, the obtained GNP-SiNRs
were suspended into 10 mL of water and stored at 4 °C for use
in the future. The size of the GNPs that decorated the SiNR’s
surface can be adjusted by adding different amounts of 1% HAuCl4 (0, 2, 4, or 6 mL).

Preparation of GNP-SiNR-Ab1 and
GNP-Ab1 Conjugates
GNP-SiNR-Ab1 and
GNP-Ab1 conjugates were prepared according to the reported
methods with
slight modifications.60 (Please see the
preparation details in the Supporting Information.)

Analytical Procedure
Lateral-flow strip biosensors
(LFSB) were prepared according to the reported procedure with minor
modifications.60 (Please see the preparation
details in the Supporting Information.)
The assay was performed by dipping the LFSB in a 1.50 mL microcentrifuge
tube containing the desired concentration of rabbit IgG in 0.10 mL
of running buffer (PBST with 1% BSA). The test and control zones could
be evaluated visually within 20 min. The intensities of the test line
and the control line were measured using a strip reader, and the results
were further analyzed using the GoldBio strip-reader software.

Results
and Discussion
GNP-Decorated SiNRs as Colored Reagents in
the LFSB
Silica-based nanomaterials (nanoparticles, nanorods,
and nanowires)
have shown great promise in various fields due to the nanomaterials’
unique physical and chemical stability as well as their well-established
surface modification.61,62 In the current study, silica
nanowires (SiNWs) and nanorods were used as substrates to coat GNPs
due to the larger surface area per rod or wire compared to that per
nanoparticle. The synthesized GNP-SiNWs and GNP-SiNRs were used as
labels for the lateral-flow assays. The mobility of GNP-SiNWs was
much slower than that of GNP-SiNRs on the nitrocellulose membrane
due to the large size of the SiNWs. (The length of SiNWs is up to
tens of micrometers; results not shown.) Therefore, we chose GNP-SiNRs,
which have a dark purple color and better mobility, as the colored
reagents.

Preparation and Characteristics of GNP-Decorated SiNRs (GNP-SiNRs)
A two-step deposition process involving gold-seed deposition and
seed growth was used to prepare the GNP-SiNRs. SiNRs with a length
varying from 3.4 to 7.0 μm (Figure 2A)
were used as the substrate to load numerous GNPs. Gold seeds were
deposited on the SiNR surface by simply mixing GNP and SiNR solutions
for 20 min. Figure 2B presents the typical
SEM image of the gold-seed-loaded SiNRs. One can see that the gold
seeds with a diameter of 9.7 ± 1.6 nm are monodispersed on the
SiNR surface. The gold-seed-decorated SiNRs were then added to a gold
growth solution to form a uniform GNP layer. Figure 2C shows the SEM image of GNP-decorated SiNRs after the GNP
growth process. A layer of GNPs was coated on the SiNR surface, and
the density of GNPs was much higher than the gold-seed-decorated SiNRs.
To further identify the formation of the GNP layer on the SiNR surface,
element analysis was performed by the EDS technique. A strong peak
for the gold signal was observed in the EDS spectra of GNP-SiNRs,
indicating that GNPs were successfully loaded on the SiNRs (Figure 2D). Figure 2E presents the
UV–vis absorption spectra of the GNP-SiNR suspension, gold-seed
solution, and SiNR suspension. No UV–vis absorption (Figure 2E, a) was observed for the SiNR solution while a
typical surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption peak at around
514 nm of gold-seed solution was observed (Figure 2E, b). However, GNP-SiNRs showed a red-shifted SPR band in
the near-infrared region compared to that of the gold seeds (Figure 2E, c).

EDS spectra of GNP-SiNRs, and (E) UV–vis spectra of SiNRs (a),
gold seeds (b), and GNP-SiNRs (c).

We studied the effect of the HAuCl4 concentration
in
the seed growth solution on the GNP size and coverage on the SiNR
surface (Figure 3). Without the addition of
a gold precursor (HAuCl4) in the growth solution, the GNP
size (9.7 ± 1.6 nm) did not change, and GNPs were evenly positioned
on the SiNR surface (Figure 3A). By adding
2 mL of 1% HAuCl4, gold seeds grew to bigger GNPs with
a size of 16.7 ± 2.4 nm (Figure 3B). In
the case of 4 and 6 mL of 1% HAuCl4 addition to the growth
solution, the SiNR surface was covered with a layer of GNPs (Figure 3C–D). However, a large number of free GNPs
was synthesized when 6 mL of 1% HAuCl4 solution was added.
Therefore, in the following lateral-flow immunoassay application,
GNP-SiNR synthesized from the addition of 4 mL of 1% HAuCl4 in the growth solution was used as the colored reagent. On the basis
of the surface area of a SiNR (diameter: 200 nm; length: 3.4 μm)
and cross section area of a GNP (diameter: 16.7 nm), it was estimated
that there were around 10 000 GNPs coated on a single silica
nanorod.

GNP-SiNR-Label-Based LFSB
The GNP-SiNRs
were, thus,
used as labels to fabricate the LFSB. Rabbit IgG was used as model
target to demonstrate the proof-of-concept. Figure 1 schematically illustrates the LFSB’s configuration
and measuring principle. The LFSB consisted of a sample pad, a conjugate
pad, an absorption pad, and a nitrocellulose membrane (test line and
control line; Figure 1A). All the components
were assembled on a common-adhesive backing layer. Goat antirabbit
IgG Ab1 was conjugated with GNP-SiNRs, and the Ab1-GNP-SiNR conjugates were dispensed on the conjugate pad. Goat antirabbit
IgG Ab1 was also used as the capture antibody and was dispensed
on the test zone of the nitrocellulose membrane. Mouse antigoat IgG
Ab2 was used as the secondary antibody and was immobilized
on the control zone of the nitrocellulose membrane, which was 2 mm
behind the test zone (Figure 1B). During the
assay, the LFSB was dipped into a test tube, and the sample solution
moved up by capillary force. The Ab1-GNP-SiNRs conjugates
were rehydrated and released from the conjugate pad. The binding between
Ab1 in Ab1-GNP-SiNR conjugates and rabbit IgG
(target) occurred, and the formed complexes (IgG-Ab1-GNPs-SiNRs)
continued to migrate along the membrane. When reaching the test zone,
the complexes were captured by the antibody on the test zone via the
second immunoreaction, resulting in the accumulation of GNP-SiNRs
on the test zone. A dark-purple band was observed, and the color intensity
of the test band was directly proportional to the amount of analyte
(IgG) in the sample solution. The solution continued to flow until
it passed through the control zone where the excess Ab1-GNP-SiNRs conjugates were captured by the secondary antibody (antigoat
IgG Ab2) to produce a second dark-purple band (Figure 1C, right). In the absence of the target, only the
band on the control zone was observed, and no band was observed in
the test zone. In this case, the band in the control zone (control
line) showed that the LFSB was working properly (Figure 1C, left). Quantitative analysis was achieved by reading the
test-line intensities with a portable strip reader. The more analytes
are present in the sample, the more conjugates would be captured on
the test zone, leading to the increased signal.

To confirm the
signal amplification of the GNP-SiNRs, the responses of the sample
solutions at three concentration levels (0, 1.0, and 5.0 ng mL–1 IgG) on the GNP-SiNR-based LFSB were compared with
the GNP-based LFSB. Figure 4 presents the photo
images of the LFSBs after the assays were complete. When rabbit IgG
was absent in the sample solutions, neither of the two LFSBs showed
a response on the test zones (Figure 4A). No
test line could be observed from the GNP-based LFSB in the presence
of 1.0 ng mL–1 rabbit IgG (Figure 4B, left) while there was a visible test line on the GNP-SiNR-based
LFSB (Figure 4B, right). As shown in Figure 4C, the intensity of the test line on the GNP-SiNR-based
LFSB in the presence of 5.0 ng mL–1 rabbit IgG was
significantly higher than that of the GNP-based LFSB which exhibited
a very weak response. Such dramatic signal enhancement on the GNP-SiNR-based
LFSB is mostly due to the large surface area of the SiNRs where numerous
GNPs were loaded. The number of the captured GNPs per antibody–antigen
binding on the GNP-SiNR-based LFSB would be much higher than that
of the GNP-based LFSB. In addition, the antibody density on the Ab1-GNP-SiNR conjugates would be higher than that of the Ab1-GNP conjugates. The immunoreaction efficiency on the GNP-SiNR-based
LFSB was, thus, higher than that for the GNP-based LFSB with a short
assay time.

LFSBs (right) in the presence of different concentrations of rabbit
IgG: (A) 0 ng mL–1, (B) 1.0 ng mL–1, and (C) 5.0 ng mL–1.

Optimization of Experimental Parameters
The amount
of capture Ab1 on the LFSB test zone affects the LFSB response.
Figure 5A presents the effect for the capture
Ab1 amount on the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of the LFSB.
The amount of Ab1 on the test zone was determined by the
dispensing cycles of the Ab1. The S/N ratio was the highest
for one dispensing cycle of 1.2 mg mL–1 (8 ×
10–6 mol L–1) Ab1 on
the test zone. The decreased S/N with more dispensing cycles resulted
from the higher background signal. Therefore, one dispensing cycle
(around 0.3 μL of solution) was used as the optimal condition
in the following experiments.

Figure 5 (A) Effect of dispensing cycles of Ab1 on the LFSB’s
S/N ratio. Loading volume of Ab1-GNP-SiNR conjugates: 2
μL; Ab1 concentration in the conjugate: 5 μg
mL–1; running buffer: PBST (1% BSA). (B) Effect
of Ab1 concentration in the conjugate solution on the LFSB’s
S/N ratio. Dispensing cycle of Ab1: 1 cycle; loading volume

PBST (1% BSA). (C) Effect of running buffer components on the LFSB’s
S/N ratio. Dispensing cycle of Ab1: 1 cycle; loading volume
of Ab1-GNP-SiNR conjugates: 2 μL; Ab1 concentration
in the conjugate: 10 μg mL–1. (D) Effect for
the loading volume of Ab1-GNP-SiNR conjugates on the LFSB’s
S/N ratio. Dispensing cycle of Ab1: 1 cycle; Ab1 concentration in the conjugate: 10 μg mL–1; running buffer: PBST (1% BSA). Rabbit IgG concentration: 1.0 ng
mL–1.

The amount of Ab1 on the GNP-SiNRs surface affects
the
LFSB’s immunoreaction efficiency and sensitivity. We optimized
the Ab1 concentration in the conjugation solution. The
LFSB’s S/N ratio increased up to 10 μg mL–1 (∼6.7 × 10–8 mol L–1) Ab1 in the conjugation solution; a further concentration
increase caused a decreased S/N ratio (Figure 5B). The decrease of S/N ratio was due to the decreased immunoreaction
efficiency when a higher amount of antibody was conjugated on the
SiNRs. On the basis of the optimal concentration of Ab1 antibodies for preparing the conjugate, there were approximately
11 000 antibodies absorbed on a single silica nanorod. Concentrations
exceeding the optimal condition may cause the steric hindrance of
the antibodies absorbed on the surface and consequently result in
the decreased antibody–antigen binding efficiency. Since the
antibodies are polyclonal antibodies, which could recognize multiple
epitopes on one antigen, the molar ratio of antibody–antigen
is at least 1:1. As a result, 10 μg mL–1 Ab1 antibodies was employed to prepare the Ab1-GNP-SiNR
conjugates in the following experiments.

The running buffer’s
composition is one of the main factors
in developing a biosensor because it has a significant impact on the
efficiency of antibody–antigen binding and the elimination
of nonspecific adsorption. Several buffers, including PBS (1% BSA),
PBST (1% BSA), and Tris-HCl (1% BSA), were tested, and the results
are shown in Figure 5C. The highest S/N ratio
was obtained with the PBST (1% BSA) buffer. Therefore, a PBST (1%
BSA) buffer was selected for the experiments.

The band intensities
depended on the Ab1-GNP-SiNR conjugates
captured on the test and control zones which, in turn, corresponded
to the amount of conjugates on the conjugate pad. To obtain a maximum
response using a minimal amount of Ab1-GNP-SiNR conjugates,
the Ab1-GNP-SiNRs on the conjugate pad were optimized by
increasing the volume of the Ab1-GNP-SiNR conjugates loaded
on the conjugate pad. Figure 5D displays the
histogram for the LFSB’s S/N ratio with an increasing volume
of conjugate solution (0.8 to 8 μL). It can be seen that the
S/N ratio increased up to 4 μL; a further volume increase caused
a decreased S/N ratio. The S/N ratio loss at a high volume may be
attributed to the saturation of signal intensity and an increased
nonspecific adsorption. Therefore, 4 μL of Ab1-GNP-SiNR
conjugate was employed as the optimal volume for the entire study.

Analytical Performance
Under optimal experimental conditions,
we examined the performance of the GNP-SiNR-based LFSB with different
concentrations of rabbit IgG. Figure 6 presents
the typical photo images (right) and the corresponding optical response
recorded with a portable strip reader in the presence of different
concentrations of rabbit IgG (0 to 2.0 ng mL–1).
There was no test line observed on the LFSB test zone in the absence
of rabbit IgG (control), indicating negligible nonspecific adsorption
under the optimized experimental condition. The test line was quite
visible, even at 0.05 ng mL–1 rabbit IgG which can
be used as the threshold for the visual determination (yes/no) of
rabbit IgG without instrumentation. In addition, quantitative detection
was performed by recording the peak areas of the test bands with the
aid of a portable strip reader (Figure 7).
It was observed that the peak area increased with an increase in the
rabbit IgG concentration until reaching a plateau at 100 ng mL–1. The saturation of the calibration curve was caused
by the physical size of the surface area of the test line limiting
the number of GNP-SiND that could bind. On the basis of the response
of 100 ng mL–1 (∼6.7 × 10–10 mol L–1) of rabbit IgG, the molar ratio of capture
antibody (test line)/rabbit IgG (target)/report antibody (GNP-SiNR-Ab)
was estimated to be 10:1:4. The peak area had a linear correlation
with the rabbit IgG concentration in the lower concentration range
(0.05–2.0 ng mL–1) as shown in the inset
of Figure 7. The calibration equation was determined
to be peak value A = 188.76C + 61.908
with a correlation coefficient of 0.9941, where A and C represent the peak area and the concentration
of rabbit IgG, respectively. The detection limit was estimated to
be 0.01 ng mL–1 (∼6.7 × 10–14 mol L–1) from 3 times the standard deviation corresponding
to the blank sample detection (S/N = 3). Compared to other labels
for visual detection, the detection limit of GNP-SiNR-based LFSB is
comparable with that of the fluorescent microspheres,63 almost 50-fold lower than the GNP-based LFSB,64 1000-fold lower than the blue-colored latex
particle-based LFSB,65 and 5 orders of
magnitude improved in comparison with a competitive liposome-based
LFSB.66

Figure 7 Calibration curve of the LFSB. The inset shows
the linear response
for rabbit IgG. Each data point represents the average value obtained
from three different measurements.

Selectivity and Reproducibility
Selectivity and reproducibility
are two important parameters to evaluate a biosensor’s performance.
The selectivity of the GNP-SiNR-based LFSB was assessed by testing
the responses of other proteins (thrombin, CEA, human IgG, and PDGF-BB)
at 100 ng mL–1, as well as the mixtures of rabbit
IgG (1 ng mL–1) and the nontarget protein (100 ng
mL–1). The histogram of the responses and the corresponding
photo images are shown in Figure S1 (Supporting
Information). Excellent selectivity for rabbit IgG, over other
proteins, was achieved. The sensitive and specific response was coupled
with high reproducibility. The reproducibility of the GNP-SiNR-based
LFSB was studied by testing the sample solutions at different concentration
levels (0, 0.5, 5, and 50 ng mL–1 rabbit IgG). Samples
from the same batch preparation and at the same concentration level
were tested 6 times with 6 different LFSBs. Similar responses were
obtained at the same concentration level. (See the histogram of the
responses in Figure S2, Supporting Information.) The relative standard deviations for the signals were 1.80%, 6.63%,
3.93%, and 5.49% for 50, 5, 0.5, and 0 ng mL–1 rabbit
IgG, respectively, indicating an excellent reproducibility.

Conclusions
We have developed a highly sensitive lateral-flow strip biosensor
(LFSB) using GNP-SiNRs as labels. The LFSB detection limit was lowered
50 times compared to the traditional GNP-based lateral-flow assay.
As demonstrated here, the significance of this work is to introduce
a new type of nanolabel for signal enhancement on the lateral-flow
immunoassay. In addition, the GNP-SiNRs can be used as nanolabels
for nucleic acid and other biological molecular detection with high
sensitivity. Future work will aim to detect cancer biomarkers (proteins
and nucleic acids) in human blood or serum.
