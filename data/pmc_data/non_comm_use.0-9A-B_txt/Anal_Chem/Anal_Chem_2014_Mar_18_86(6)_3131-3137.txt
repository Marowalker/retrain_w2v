Bacterial growth inhibition tests
have become a standard measure
of the adverse effects of inhibitors for a wide range of applications,
such as toxicity testing in the medical and environmental sciences.
However, conventional well-plate formats for these tests are laborious
and provide limited information (often being restricted to an end-point
assay). In this study, we have developed a microfluidic system that
enables fast quantification of the effect of an inhibitor on bacteria
growth and survival, within a single experiment. This format offers
a unique combination of advantages, including long-term continuous
flow culture, generation of concentration gradients, and single cell
morphology tracking. Using Escherichia coli and the
inhibitor amoxicillin as one model system, we show excellent agreement
between an on-chip single cell-based assay and conventional methods
to obtain quantitative measures of antibiotic inhibition (for example,
minimum inhibition concentration). Furthermore, we show that our methods
can provide additional information, over and above that of the standard
well-plate assay, including kinetic information on growth inhibition
and measurements of bacterial morphological dynamics over a wide range
of inhibitor concentrations. Finally, using a second model system,
we show that this chip-based systems does not require the bacteria
to be labeled and is well suited for the study of naturally occurring
species. We illustrate this using Nitrosomonas europaea, an environmentally important bacteria, and show that the chip system
can lead to a significant reduction in the period required for growth
and inhibition measurements (<4 days, compared to weeks in a culture
flask).

Conventional
bacterial growth
inhibition tests have become a standard measure of the adverse effects
of compounds or materials on an aerobic organism. Such established
protocols are now widely used in pharmacological, environmental monitoring,
food safety, and wastewater toxicity investigations.1,2 However, these tests are time-consuming, are labor intensive, and
require large amounts of reagents (the standard assay generally involves
bacterial culture in a series of dilutions, followed by measurement
of bacterial number or metabolic products).1 Since these assays are, in general, end-point measurements, it is
often difficult to monitor the kinetics of bacterial growth in situ or to retrieve other information such as bacterial
morphological changes.

Additional considerations also have to
be given in areas where
wild type or naturally occurring species are of interest. Outside
of the laboratory, bacteria live in diverse environments and their
physiology is dependent on local conditions and the species that they
live in close contiguity with.3 Many of
these influences cannot be accommodated in conventional flask or microtiter
well-based cultivation techniques.

Microfluidics offers some
clear advantages over these existing
formats, providing the possibility to develop high throughput, real-time,
low sample consumption assays for bacterial growth tests.4−6 For example, in the context of screening antibiotic toxicity, microdroplet
based systems have already been demonstrated by carrying out multiple
functional assays with minute samples (e.g., <100 μL).7,8 However, microdroplet methods come with additional challenges, including
the need for highly sensitive optical readout systems in order to
detect low levels of signal (e.g fluorescence) in small droplets moving
very fast.

An alternative method that appears more adaptable
to a microbiology
laboratory is to track the growth of bacteria on a microfluidic chip.
Because of the nonadherent nature of many bacteria, immobilization
or trapping of bacteria on-chip is necessary for time-lapse observations.
The use of geometrical barriers, including microchannels,9,10 microchambers,11,12 single cell tracks,13,14 and sandwiching a monolayer of bacteria between an agar membrane
and glass slide15 have all been shown to
be feasible. For growth and IC50 studies, most of these methods still
require off-chip preparation of a series of dilutions and knowledge
of potential conditions for the test, which can be cumbersome for
unknown systems.

It is now well established that generating
concentration gradients
within a microfluidic system provides an effective means for evaluating
a wide range of conditions in a single experiment.16−20 In conjunction with time lapse tracking of single
cells, concentration gradient microfluidics has become an effective
means for the study of cell migration (e.g chemotaxis).9,16,21−25 Surprisingly, its implementation for bacterial growth
inhibition tests is less well reported, perhaps because of the difficulty
of fixing/retaining the bacteria on the chip.

Recently, Choi
et al. developed a microfluidic agarose channel
system for trapping bacteria under a gradient of antibiotics and illustrated
its potential for fast evaluation of antibiotic susceptibility.26 However, tracking the growth of multilayer bacteria
in a 3D gel is challenging and requires specialized skills. Here,
as an alternative, we describe a simple, gradient microfluidic system
for rapid bacterial growth inhibition tests that is based on single
bacterial morphology tracking. It employs the simple assembly of a
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chip and a thin agarose membrane to establish
steady concentration gradients of inhibitors over a monolayer of bacteria.
Compared with previous studies, our system enables long-term tracking
of morphological dynamics of individual bacteria under a wide range
of inhibitor concentrations and thus allows fast evaluation of inhibition
with both quantitative and mechanistic information.

In this
report we illustrate this method using two model systems.
First, with Escherichia coli (E. coli) and amoxicillin we quantitatively compare the on-chip assay with
conventional laboratory-based dilution methods. Second, we evaluated
the capability of this on-chip approach for long-term cell studies
(∼4 days) on Nitrosomonas europaea, an environmentally
important nitrificating bacteria. In this case, for the first time,
we are able to show how the local microenvironment can have a profound
influence on investigations of bacteria such as these, that have a
complex natural habitat.

Materials and Methods
Microfluidic Device
The microfluidic device developed
in this study comprises an assembly of a coverslip, a thin agarose
gel membrane, and a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chip, Figure 1a. The chip consists of two parallel channels at
a distance of 1 mm apart. The length, width, and depth dimensions
of each channel were 13 mm × 500 μm × 500 μm,
respectively.

Figure 1 Configuration of the three-layered microfluidic device:
(a) cross
section of the device that consists of a glass substrate, a thin agarose
membrane, and a PDMS chip. A monolayer of bacteria were trapped between
the agarose layer and the glass substrate (not to scale); (b) photograph
of the assembled device in a plastic manifold.

The thin agarose gel membrane was made from 2% agarose (Sigma-Aldrich)
in reverse osmosis (RO) water. The solution was autoclaved, gelled,
and stored at 4 °C prior to use. To obtain a uniformly thick
membrane, the gel was melted at 65 °C and cast between two clean
coverslips separated by a 250 μm thick PDMS spacer. The assembly
was sterilized with UV light for 30 min and then left for 20 min to
gell. After removal of the top coverslip and the spacer, the membrane
was slid onto the channel side of an upturned PDMS chip.

To
form a monolayer of bacteria, 3 μL of a bacterial suspension
(OD600 in the range of 0.05–0.08) was dispensed
onto the center of the agarose gel membrane and immediately covered
with a coverslip, Figure 1b. The assembly was
clamped in a plastic holder with spring loaded screws to ensure even
pressure distribution, Figure 1c. New agarose
gel and coverslips are used for each experiment to minimize contamination.
The rest of the device is reusable and after UV sterilization was
reassembled to perform repeated tests on fresh bacteria samples.

Bacteria Culture
Culture of Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Nitrosomonas europaea (ATCC25978)
are described in the Supporting Information.

On-Chip Inhibitory Test
On-chip inhibition tests were
conducted by delivering “source” and “sink”
solutions through parallel channels in the chip, Figure 1c. Solutions were continuously delivered at a speed of 0.33
mm/s by a syringe pump (NE-4000, Newera Pump Systems Inc.). The “source”
solution contained medium plus either 5 mg/L (E. coli) or 15 mg/L (N. europaea) amoxicillin, and the
“sink” solution contained medium alone. Shortly after
delivery of the two solutions, a steady concentration gradient was
established via diffusion through the agarose membrane to the bacterial
monolayer underneath. To visualize the time course and profile of
the gradient formed, 30 μM fluorescein (MW = 332.31, Sigma-Aldrich)
solution was used in a parallel set of (bacteria free) experiments.
All experiments were performed at room temperature (21–22 °C),
in line with a habitat temperature commonly found for bacteria in
the environment. At least three replicate experiments were conducted
for each of the conditions reported below.

Off-Chip Inhibitory Test
Three replicate wells were
filled with 5 μL of bacterial suspension and 295 μL of
LB broth, with or without added amoxicillin (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mg/L).
Plates were placed on an orbital shaker (150 rpm, 22 °C) and
the OD600 recorded every 30 min for 12 h with a plate reader
(Synergy HT, Biotek).

Optical Image Acquisition and Analysis
Time-lapse images
were recorded using a motorized inverted microscope equipped with
a 40× objective lens (Zeiss AxioObserver Z1, Photometrics Cascade
II CCD) by observation through the coverslip. All images were processed
with Image J and autocontrast was applied to bright field images to
give clearly defined cell edges. Bright field images were processed
and cell areas calculated as described in the Supporting Information.

Calculation of Bacterial
Growth Rate
Conventionally,
the growth rates of bacteria in suspension culture are determined
by 1  where R is the increment
ratio, OD0 and OD are the optical density (OD600) of suspended cells (i.e., an indirect measure of cell density as
mass rather than numbers per unit volume)27,28 initially (t = 0) and after a time t; μ is the specific growth rate (h–1), and tm is the lag period of bacterial growth.

For the on-chip culture, since bacteria grow as a nonconfluent monolayer,
cell mass in a colony can be considered to be directly proportional
to the colony’s area.15 Therefore
this can be used to analyze the growth rates of the bacteria within
the colony via the following equation. 2  where S0 and S are the bacterial colony areas at the initial (t = 0) time and at time t. For on-chip
measurements of bacterial growth, estimations for a given concentration
were made using at least 10 randomly selected colonies.

Results
and Discussion
Characterization of Concentration Gradients
The concentration
gradient of amoxicillin in the device was estimated by collecting
fluorescence images when fluorescein was used in place of amoxicillin
in the source channel (note, amoxicillin and fluorescein have similar
molecular weights and consequently similar diffusion characteristics).
Because of the porous structure and high water content (98%) of agarose
gel membranes, diffusion leads to the concentration gradient of fluorescein
(or amoxicillin) at the membrane/coverslip interface being rapidly
established, as shown in Figure 2a. Because
of the continuous flow system used, the slight absorption of fluorescein
(or other nonpolar small molecules) into the PDMS chip does not significantly
affect the concentration gradient formed below the agarose layer.

Figure 2 Concentration
gradient formed under the agarose layer in the microfluidic
chip: (a) bright field (top) and fluorescence (bottom) images of the
source and sink channels at time 20 min. The focal plane was set by
focusing at the interface between the agarose layer and the coverslip
surface; this ensured that the fluorescence profile accurately corresponds
to the concentration surrounding the bacteria. The distance between
the source (where x = 0) and the sink channel is
1 mm; (b) evolution of fluorescein diffusion profiles during the first
6 h of microfluidic flow. Inset shows the concentration gradient versus
distance at time 20 min.

Timelapse fluorescence images recorded over a period of 6
h showed
that the intensity profile changed by <10% after 20 min (Figure 2b and Figure S1, Supporting
Information). The concentration profiles were readily derived
from the intensity profiles because of their excellent linear relationship
(Figure S2, Supporting Information). It
should be noted, the concentration at the source channel, where x = 0, was assumed to be the maximum concentration of fluorescein
(Figure 2a). Furthermore, stable flows (e.g.,
0.33 mm/s) in the two channels were found to be important to maintain
the steady profile throughout the experiment. The concentration profile
of fluorescein at time 60 min served as a calibration curve to calculate
amoxicillin concentrations across the channel and was acquired after
each inhibitory test to validate the anticipated concentration profile.
These calibrations showed that the consistency of the chip assemblies
and the distance/concentration relationships varied by less than 5%.

Cell Growth On-Chip and In Well-Plates
The continuous
flow culture formed in the microfluidic chip provided constant nutrient
supply and removal of metabolic waste. Given the abundance of nutrients,
bacterial cells were able to grow exponentially within the monolayer,
making it possible to directly monitor single cell division and morphologic
variations in situ via simple bright field microscopy
without resorting to complicated fluorescence labeling efforts (e.g.,
fusing fluorescence genes into cells).

Time-lapse images of E. coli cells were used to track their growth during 5 h
experiments. A typical example (Figure 3) shows
that cells growing underneath the (amoxicillin free) sink channel
proliferate readily. By optimizing the dispensing conditions, bacteria
were seeded as individuals, evenly distributed as a monolayer between
the agarose membrane and coverslip. After a period of 2 h, colonies
originating from these single cells formed and expanded by cell division,
with continued growth leading to merging (5 h, Figure 3). The areas that a cell and its colony occupied were calculated
from time-lapse images and used to derive individual cell growth rates.

Figure 3 Bacterial
growth on-chip. Time-lapse images of monolayer growth
of E. coli during the first 5 h of on-chip cultivation.
Scale bars 10 μm.

The growth curves of E. coli cultured on-chip
were compared to those of conventional 96-well plate suspension cultures,
Figure S3, Supporting Information. Typically,
the growth curves in suspension culture showed no lag phase (tm = 0 h), an exponential growth phase (until t = 3 h), and then a stationary phase (t > 3 h). In the case of on-chip culture, after a short lag phase
(tm estimated to be 1.2 h), exponential
growth was observed and sustained for the duration of the experiment.
It is believed that the on-chip culture lag phase may be due to acclimatization
of bacteria to their new environment, i.e., from broth suspension
to the surface of a glass substrate. Nevertheless, the specific growth
rates μ, derived from the linear slope of the growth curves,
were 0.89 h–1 and 0.92 h–1 for
the on-chip and suspension culture, respectively. These are in good
agreement with each other, indicating that growth using the two formats
is directly comparable.

A key feature in the layered design
of this microfluidic chip that
distinguishes it from other gradient microfluidic devices16,26 is that the supply of nutrients and removal of waste occurs at all
points across the porous membrane. Thus, bacteria can be kept growing
in the exponential phase, without being inhibited by metabolically
produced toxins or waste products. This provides a reliable means
to perform investigations that require continuous, long-term culture
without the undesirable influences of a stationary growth phase.

Inhibition Tests On-Chip and In Suspension
In on-chip
experiments, time-lapse, tiled images provide a means to calculate
the growth of bacteria exposed to the whole range of amoxicillin concentrations
generated within the gradient. For example, in Figure 4a, E. coli at five different locations corresponding
to five different amoxicillin concentrations (cAM) are shown. The concentration associated with each frame
corresponds to that at the center of the image (note: each image is
110 μm × 100 μm).

Figure 4 Inhibitory effect of E. coli by amoxicillin: (a)
time-lapse images of monolayers of bacterial cells exposed to different
concentrations of amoxicillin during the first 5 h of experiments
(the horizontal black line in the 5 mg/L images is the edge of the
source channel). Scale bars 10 μm. (b) The growth curves of E. coli at different concentrations. (c) Concentration and
growth rates curves for on-chip (n = 10, randomly
selected 10 colonies at the same concentration) and well plate tests.
Sigmoidal fitting was applied to the curves to derive an IC50. The
standard deviation for some data points on the 96-well plate curve
are less than 4% of the average value, making the error bars invisible.

Time-lapse images of the five
locations clearly show that the inhibitory
effects of amoxicillin on E. coli are both concentration
and time dependent, Figure 4a. For example,
at t = 2 h, cell growth was observed at all amoxicillin
concentrations; at t = 4 h, elongation of cells (i.e.,
filamentation indicated by arrows in the figure) was dominant at low
concentrations cAM ≤ 2.0 mg/L and
cell dissolution (indicated with stars) occurred at high concentrations
(i.e., cAM ≥ 4.0 mg/L). This phenomenon
suggests that the elimination of E. coli with amoxicillin
takes time, and several stages are involved in the killing process
(as detailed in the next section).

The growth curves of E. coli at different amoxicillin
concentrations are shown in Figure 4b. Below
2 mg/L amoxicillin, an exponential growth phase is maintained, indicating
the antibiotic has negligible effects. At 3 mg/L amoxicillin and above,
the inhibition of growth was observed. At these higher concentrations,
after an initial growth phase the onset of decline in growth rate
is dependent on the amoxicillin concentration (higher concentrations
lead to earlier loss of bacteria). Similar relationships were observed
with 96-well plates, where E. coli growth was inhibited
when the amoxicillin concentration was above 2.0 mg/L (Figure S4, Supporting Information).

The half maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) is often used
to describe the effectiveness of an inhibitor and can be derived from
sigmoidal fitting of concentration–growth rates (μ) curves
(Figure 4c). It was found that the IC50 for
amoxicillin was 2.0 mg/L when using a 96-well plate and 2.5 mg/L for
the on-chip system, showing a good agreement between the two methods.

Similarly, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), a common
measure in antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST), can be readily
interpolated from Figure 4c. Since MIC refers
to the minimum concentration of an antibiotic that gives total inhibition,
it can be derived from the point on the curves where the specific
growth rate approaches zero. The MIC of E. coli to
amoxicillin obtained from both on-chip and 96-well plate assays was
3.0 mg/L. This is well within the range of 2–8 mg/L reported
by the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute.29 Considering the long period (usually 16–24 h) and
tedious dilutions involved in conventional AST measurements, the microfluidic
format demonstrated an advantageous speed that is combined with a
reliable performance.

Single Cell Morphological Dynamics in Response
to Amoxicillin
Inhibition
Amoxicillin is one kind of β-lactam antibiotic,
which can inhibit the development of a bacterial cell wall by interfering
with transpeptidase enzymes responsible for the formation of the cross-linkage
between peptidoglycan strands. In response to environmental pressures,
for example, antibiotic inhibition, bacteria can undergo diverse morphological
changes in order to survive.30 Despite
amoxicillin being one of the most widely used antibiotics, little
is known about its detailed influence on single cell shape dynamics.
In this study, we demonstrate an application of using our microfluidic
systems for high-throughput tracking of single cell morphological
dynamics under a wide range of antibiotic concentrations.

Our
on-chip inhibition analysis of E. coli allows direct
correlation of single cell morphological variations with amoxicillin
concentrations and time scales. As shown in Figure 4a, during the initial growth period (0–2 h), filamentation
of cells was observed at each amoxicillin concentration. Filamentation
of E. coli under antibiotic treatment has been reported
previously12,15,30 and is regarded as a survival mechanism. For some of the cells,
a second stage, bulging, the black dot in the middle of the filament
body indicated by the arrowhead in Figure 4a, occurs. These cells could be tracked and with higher amoxicillin
concentrations or prolonged treatment, bulging cells underwent a final
lysis stage and left faint residue on the surface. From numerous observations,
it was clear that the occurrence of each stage (filament–bulge–lysis)
is a hierarchical order and depends on the combination of amoxicillin
concentration and treatment periods. For example, after the same period
of treatment (e.g., 4 h) filamentation was prevalent at lower concentrations
(cAM ≤ 1 mg/L) whereas more severe
damage (i.e., bulge formation and lysis) was dominant at higher concentrations
(cAM ≥ 3 mg/L) (Figure S5a, Supporting Information). The morphological variations
of E. coli were further confirmed with high-resolution
SEM images of cells exposed to amoxicillin (Figure S5b, Supporting Information).

From this finding,
we propose that variations of bacterial length
are a good measure to indicate different stages during the killing
process. With the time-lapse images, we obtained bacterial lengths
over the full range of concentration gradients of amoxicillin. For
example, measurements at t = 4 h are shown in Figure 5, where the x-axis indicates the
distance of bacteria from the source amoxicillin channel, the left y-axis is the average length of bacteria at a distance “x”, and the right y-axis is the
corresponding concentration of amoxicillin. In relation to the concentration
gradient, bacterial lengths presented three distinct clusters: (1)
a flat, low cell length region (between 0 and 1 mg/L), suggesting
negligible changes and normal growth; (2) a broad plateau region (between
1.5 and 3 mg/L) after a step increase from region 1 suggesting elongation
or filamentation of cells. (Here, the relatively large deviation at
each data point shows the heterogeneity in resistance of individual
cells); and finally (3) a second flat, lowest cell length region (cAM ≥ 4 mg/L). This lowest cell length
region is an indication of total growth inhibition, and interestingly,
the lowest concentration in this region (4 mg/L) matches the MIC valued
obtained by conventional AST measurement well.31 Clearly, the use of bacterial length as a readout provides
a vivid illustration of both quantitative and mechanistic information
of the inhibitory effect.

and amoxicillin
concentration (line) at different distances from the source channel.
Each data point is an average of 20 randomly chosen cells in the region.
Error bars are standard deviations.

Benefits for Long-Term Studies of Naturally Occurring Bacteria
Wild type or bacteria in the environment are often the subjects
of interest. However, they are less known and difficult to study.
To assess the applicability of our approach for the investigation
of these naturally occurring species, we carried out a preliminary
study on the inhibition of amoxicillin on N. europaea. As an ammonia oxidizing bacteria N. europaea plays
a central role in the global nitrogen cycle and in the elimination
of the damage of ammonia fertilizers and estrogen do to the environment.32,33 However, they have proved difficult to study via conventional cultivation
methods because of their slow proliferation rate and sensitivity to
variations in their environments.34

Time lapse tracking of the growth of N. europaea on-chip was carried out for 4 days. As shown in Figure S6, Supporting Information, N. europaea are small rod-like bacteria and tend to clump together. Similar
to E. coli growth on-chip, a continuous exponential
growth was observed after a lag period (tm = 20 h) with the specific growth rate, μ, being 0.05 h–1, Figure 6. In contrast, several
stages of growth rates were found in conventional flask culture (Figure 6). Interestingly, the initial flask growth rate
(<12 h) is 0.05 h–1, similar to that found on-chip.
After that, a very significant reduction of growth was observed until
it reached a steady value of 0.08 day–1 after ∼4
days. This reduction in rate may well reflect the fact that ammonia-oxidizing
bacteria such as N. europaea can be inhibited by
their own product, nitrite.34 In a closed
flask culture, this nitrite accumulates, whereas in the environment,
such an inhibition can be removed by the presence of nitrite-oxidizing
bacteria living in close spatial contiguity.35 It is possible that the continuous flow culture “mimics”
the bacteria’s natural habitat by removing nitrite and thereby
minimizing its inhibition. This function of the chip system is of
significant benefit in long-term cell studies, where a stable interference-free
microenvironment is essential.

Figure 6 Growth rates of Nitrosomonas europaea for on-chip
and in-flask culture.

Following successful cultivation of N. europaea on-chip for 2 days, with the bacteria in an exponential growth phase,
an amoxicillin inhibition test was begun. As shown in Figure 7, cell division and generation persisted at the
highest concentrations tested (15 mg/L, indicated by arrows in Figure 7), even after exposure for 40 h; no variations in
cell length and morphogies were observed. The observed growth at such
a high concentration suggests N. europaea is resistant
to amoxicillin.36 In comparison with the
weeks of culture and laborious spectrophotometric analysis needed
for such inhibition evaluations in flask,37 our approach provides a well controlled microenvironment that enables
fast, reliable method for “challenging” bacteria.

Conclusions
We
have developed a microfluidic platform that enables long-term
continuous culture, generation of steady concentration gradients,
and single cell tracking. The platform provided a fast and reliable
means for both quantitative and mechanistic investigations of bacterial
inhibitors.

With E. coli and amoxicillin as
a model system,
we showed an excellent agreement between on-chip single cell based
assay with conventional methods on quantitative measures (i.e., IC50
and MIC) of antibiotic inhibition. Furthermore, we show that our methods
provide rich information on bacterial morphological dynamics over
a wide range of concentrations. For the first time, we illustrate
the use of bacterial length as a read-out together with knowledge
of the concentration gradient to provide quantitative information
about an inhibitor’s efficacy.

Most importantly, our
system does not need labeling of the bacteria
and provides a novel, effective means for bacterial growth inhibition
tests, especially for investigations of slowly growing bacteria, such
as N. europaea, and could be applied to studies of
single cell variability or exposure to a range of environmental pressures.
