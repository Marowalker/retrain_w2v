This represents the first report
of laserspray ionization vacuum (LSIV) with operation
directly from atmospheric pressure
for use in mass spectrometry. Two different types of electrospray
ionization source inlets were converted to LSIV sources by equipping
the entrance of the atmospheric pressure inlet aperture with a customized
cone that is sealed with a removable glass plate holding the matrix/analyte
sample. A laser aligned in transmission geometry (at 180° relative
to the inlet) ablates the matrix/analyte sample deposited on the vacuum
side of the glass slide. Laser ablation from vacuum requires lower
inlet temperature relative to laser ablation at atmospheric pressure.
However, higher inlet temperature is required for high-mass analytes,
for example, α-chymotrypsinogen (25.6 kDa). Labile compounds
such as gangliosides and cardiolipins are detected in the negative
ion mode directly from mouse brain tissue as intact doubly deprotonated
ions. Multiple charging enhances the ion mobility spectrometry separation
of ions derived from complex tissue samples.

==== Body
In laserspray
ionization (LSI),
matrix/analyte sample is ablated into the vacuum of a mass spectrometer
producing ions with charge states similar to electrospray ionization
(ESI). LSI is distinguished as LSII when the sample is ablated at
atmospheric pressure into a heated inlet tube of
a mass spectrometer,1 and laserspray ionization vacuum (LSIV) is when the sample is ablated in vacuum.2 The analyte ion abundance observed
is a function of the inlet temperature as well as voltages normally
applied to increase ion fragmentation and surface collisions.3−5 The combination of heat, applied voltage, and collisions are thought
to assist in removing the matrix from the charged matrix/analyte clusters,
similar to desolvation in ESI.1−8

LSIV has been demonstrated on commercial vacuum matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) sources operating with the laser
aligned in reflection geometry.2,9,10 At intermediate pressure (0.16 Torr), LSIV produces results nearly
identical to LSII, but without a heated inlet tube and lower laser
fluences than used in MALDI.2,3,10 However, operation from vacuum using an ion source built for MALDI
analyses has the disadvantages of requiring several minutes to insert
and remove samples, and only a limited number of matrices are capable
of producing multiply charged ions at intermediate pressure.5,9 These matrices include 2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone (2,5-DHAP)2,11 and 2-nitrophloroglucinol (2-NPG).9,11 In LSIV, it
is assumed that matrix must be evaporated or sublimed from charged
clusters to produce the multiply charged ions, and this is facilitated
by the use of more volatile matrices. Energy for “desolvation”
is available through absorption of the laser, rf voltages, gas or
physical collisions, and the low pressure conditions,2,5,9 but it is often insufficient to
remove matrix from the less volatile charged clusters.3,12 Both 2,5-DHAP and 2-NPG require the inlet tube to be heated for
efficient ionization when ablated at atmospheric pressure using LSII.9,11

Because the initial work with LSII used a hot inlet tube to
produce
ions, the method was limited to instruments having inlet tubes that
can be significantly heated.1,5 Mass spectrometers with
skimmer inlets, such as the Waters Z-Spray ion source, required construction
of a heated inlet tube13 which has been
adapted to other sources.4 However, using
more volatile matrices, the applicability of LSIV can be extended
without requiring extensive heat. 3-Nitrobenzonitrile (3-NBN), which
sublimes at room temperature, was found to produce ions when incorporated
with the analyte without the use of a laser, voltage, or additional
heat when exposed to subatmospheric pressure.14 The energy contained in the matrix is sufficient for analyte ionization
and has been discussed to be related to luminescence characteristics
of the small molecule compound.12,14 This matrix has been
shown to produce multiply charged analyte ions when introduced to
a vacuum using an intermediate pressure MALDI source14 or directly from atmospheric pressure into an inlet aperture.15 Even though a laser is not necessary for ionization
using 3-NBN as matrix, there are applications where use of a laser
is desirable, such as sampling small areas and in imaging studies.10,16−24 Additionally, aligning the laser in transmission geometry (180°
relative to the inlet) is desirable for applications that require
higher spatial resolution20 and speed of
analysis.25

Here, we report studies
in which the atmospheric pressure inlets
of two mass spectrometers were modified to allow matrix/analyte sample
to be ablated at reduced pressure. Using laser ablation in transmission
geometry, the applicable mass range relative to previously reported
LSIV measurements was extended. Further, the inlet temperature could
be reduced relative to LSII, thereby extending the method to instruments
without a heated inlet tube. The new inlet design achieves analyses
directly from laser ablation of mouse brain tissue sections, and changing
samples becomes fast and simple with this approach.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Matrix compounds 3-NBN, 2-NPG, and 2,5-DHB
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). 2,5-DHAP was purchased
from Acros Organics (Fairlawn, NJ). More details about sample preparation
of the mouse brain tissue section and purchased standards including
lipids, peptides, and proteins can be found in the Supporting Information. All procedures involving mice were
approved by the Indiana University Bloomington Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee.

Mass Spectrometers, Ion Sources, and Methods
LSIV and
LSII were performed on the Z-Spray ion source of the SYNAPT G2 (Waters
Corporation, Milford, MA) and the Ion Max source of the LTQ Velos
(Thermo, Bremen, Germany) mass spectrometers. For open access to the
mass spectrometer inlet apertures, the exterior housing of the ESI
sources were detached and interlocks were overridden as previously
described.13,20 The laser (337 nm N2 laser, Newport Corporation, Irvine, CA) was aligned in transmission
geometry and used to dislodge the matrix/analyte from the surface
of the glass plate into the vacuum using a repetition rate of 3 to
4 Hz. A glass slide (Gold Seal, Portsmouth, NJ), transmitting at the
laser wavelength, was used as the sample holder and a lens enabled
focusing of the laser beam, as previously employed for LSII.20,26 The ablation of different areas of the stationary glass plate was
achieved either by slightly moving the lens parallel to the laser
beam or by rotating the sample plate. The source block temperature
of the SYNAPT G2 was varied from 50 to 150 °C, and the inlet
tube temperature on the LTQ Velos was varied from 50 to 450 °C.

A series of inlet cones was designed to be used on the Z-Spray
ion source of the SYNAPT G2 in place of the skimmer inlet. The glass
slide holding the matrix/analyte sample adhered to the surface of
each respective cone by the pressure differential between atmospheric
pressure and the vacuum at the inlet. The first cone (Cone A) was
modified by widening the orifice and equipping the aperture with a
connecting home-built stainless steel extension 7 mm long with a 4
mm diameter opening. The loosely connected extension has a flat outer
surface capable of creating a vacuum seal (∼2.7 Torr), but
it did not entirely restrict the air flow to the inlet. Another cone
design (Cone B) consisted of an airtight (∼0.6 Torr) stainless
steel cylinder extending 15 mm with an opening diameter of 7 mm. A
third cone (Cone C), similar to Cone B, had a notch approximately
1 mm wide and 0.5 mm deep cut into the outer surface of the cone to
provide an air flow between the glass sample holder and the inner
cone (∼2.0 Torr). The reported pressure values are an average
of pressures obtained from the backing pressure display on the Waters
SYNAPT G2. There was little variation in pressure observed for each
respective cone with the changes in source block temperature.

Results
and Discussion
The sample holder and modified atmospheric
pressure Ion Max heated
inlet tube (Thermo) and Z-Spray (Waters) sources are shown in Schemes
S1 and S2, Supporting Information, respectively.
On both sources, the laser ablation of the matrix/analyte sample occurred
under subambient pressure. Direct comparison between this LSIV approach
and LSII was achieved by adhering the glass plate to the inlet attachment
by the vacuum differential (Scheme S1A, Supporting
Information) or by placing the plate in near proximity to the
heated inlet aperture of an LTQ Velos (Scheme S1B, Supporting Information) as previously reported for LSII1 so that matrix ablation occurs at atmospheric pressure. The
matrix compounds 3-NBN, 2-NPG, 2,5-DHAP, and 2,5-DHB (Figure 1I) were selected on the basis of previous applicability.1,9,11,14 The observed ion abundance on average is lower with LSIV as compared
to LSII, but the chemical background is also lower. The results (Figures
S1–S4, Supporting Information) demonstrate
that lower temperature can be employed using vacuum assistance, which
is important for ion sources having limited heating capabilities.

Information.

The LSIV source constructed
onto a Z-Spray inlet aperture of a
Waters SYNAPT G2 (graphical abstract) can be heated to 150 °C.
Different cones (Figure 1II) exposed the matrix/analyte
to different pressures. Cones A and C provided air flow through the
loosely fitted cone attachment or a notched surface, respectively.
The airtight Cone B maintained the lowest pressure of ∼0.6
Torr and provided the least air flow to the matrix/analyte sample
and through the Z-Spray source.

The same four matrix compounds
(Figure 1I) were used to study the effect of
varying the source block temperature
from 150 to 50 °C using bovine insulin as analyte. The results
(Figure 1III) varied for the different matrices
using the three different cones (Figure 1II).
The least volatile of the matrices studied, 2,5-DHB, did not produce
ions from bovine insulin on any of the cone designs up to the maximum
source temperature of 150 °C. The most volatile of the matrices,
3-NBN (Figure 1III.A), produced the highest
ion abundance of the [M + 5H]5+ charge state at a source
temperature of 75 °C using the notched Cone C and failed to produce
meaningful analyte ions on all cone designs at the maximum source
temperature of 150 °C; the intolerance of this matrix to heat
has been previously described.14,15 It should be noted
that, with Cone C, 3-NBN did not spontaneously sublime as in the matrix
assisted ionization vacuum (MAIV) method.14,15

The 2-NPG matrix required the highest available source temperature
of 150 °C, while 2,5-DHAP provided the highest analyte ion intensity
at a source temperature of 125 °C. The airtight Cone B (Figure 1III.A, green plot lines) provided the lowest analyte
ion abundance for all matrices when compared to Cones A (Figure 1III.A, red plot lines) and C (Figure 1III.A, blue plot lines) suggesting the importance of air flow
in ion transmission and possibly aiding the ionization process.3,12 This might be expected since the Z-Spray source is designed to operate
with rather high gas flow. The representative mass spectra (Figure 1III.B) are shown corresponding to the highest ion
intensity of the [M + 5H]5+ charge state observed for bovine
insulin using each matrix. There is little to no chemical background
observed in the mass spectrum, contrary to MALDI experiments.

The ion abundance and shape of the plotted total ion chronogram
(TIC) varied across the different temperatures, pressures, and matrices
used (Figures S8–S10, Supporting Information). The most volatile of the matrices, 3-NBN, produced sharp peaks
after each laser ablation using all three cones at temperatures between
50 and 100 °C, as shown in the TIC (Figure S8A–C, Supporting Information). However, at temperatures
above 125 °C, the matrix began to visually sublime from the plate
and only a low abundant continuum of ion formation was observed (Figure
S8D,E, Supporting Information). Conversely,
2,5-DHAP required higher temperatures with a minimum of 100 °C
for abundant analyte ion observation (Figure S9E, Supporting Information). Although the matrix 2-NPG did not
produce sharp peaks in the TIC (Figure S10, Supporting
Information), it produced high analyte ion abundance at a source
temperature of 150 °C using all three cone designs (Figure S6E, Supporting Information).

Studies conducted
in the negative mode also showed that 3-NBN required
a low source temperature for ionization. For example, multiply charged
deprotonated ions for bovine insulin up to [M – 6H]6– charge states are observed at a temperature of 50 °C (Figure
S11A, Supporting Information). Previous
studies using MAIV demonstrated that this matrix efficiently ionizes
ubiquitin with −8 charges (8.5 kDa) in the negative mode and
higher mass proteins (66 kDa) up to [M + 36H]36+ in the
positive mode using conditions that permit spontaneous ionization
without the use of a laser.14 The stability
of this matrix under the LSIV conditions using Cone C comes at the
expense of more limited mass range relative to the spontaneous ionization
of MAIV.

2,5-DHAP which is less volatile than 3-NBN allows flexibility
in
temperature, air-flow, and pressure. With 2,5-DHAP, LSIV can be extended
to higher mass proteins such as α-chymotrypsinogen. Multiply
charged ions up to [M + 19H]19+ were produced for this
25.6 kDa protein using Cone C at a source temperature of 125 °C
(Figure S11B, Supporting Information).
On the atmospheric pressure source of the same mass spectrometer,
previous LSII investigations using 2,5-DHAP required a retrofitted
inlet tube heated by the source block at a temperature of 150 °C
to produce multiply charged ions of lysozyme (14.3 kDa) with 14 charges.27 Using the same matrix on the commercial intermediate
pressure (∼0.16 Torr) source of the same mass spectrometer,
the highest mass protein observed was ubiquitin (8.5 kDa), producing
multiply charged ions up to [M + 12H]12+.2 This relates well with the hypothesis that “desolvation”
of the charged matrix/analyte clusters is necessary to expose bare
analyte ions.3,12

To investigate the prospect
of fast analyses, ubiquitin, bovine
insulin, and angiotensin I were individually spotted onto a glass
microscopy slide in a triangular shape and layered with a solution
of 2,5-DHAP and dried (Figure 2I). Manual rotation
of the sample plate on the cone allowed three separate laser shots
to ablate an area of each individual matrix/analyte spot. The TIC
shows three distinct peaks corresponding to the sequential ionization
of the samples in about 18 s (Figure 2II).
Summing acquisitions for each individual peak, the mass spectra of
ubiquitin (Figure 2III.A), bovine insulin (Figure 2III.B), and angiotensin I (Figure 2III.C) were obtained with good analyte ion intensity. Importantly,
no carry-over is observed between samples when loading 1 pmol of analyte.

obtained on a Z-Spray ion source of a Waters SYNAPT G2 and a source
temperature of 125 °C using Cone C.

The utility of transmission geometry LSIV is demonstrated
using
a 10 μm thick mouse brain tissue section. 3-NBN matrix solution
was spotted directly onto the tissue surface, and the glass slide
was placed on the flat outer surface of Cone C. The cone opening encloses
the mouse brain tissue section (Figure 3I.A)
while still providing stability of the volatile 3-NBN matrix to not
spontaneously sublime from the surface. The laser beam was rastered
across the surface of the mouse brain tissue coated with matrix by
manually moving the focusing lens perpendicular to the laser beam.
Abundant singly and doubly deprotonated negatively charged ions of
lipids (Figure S12A, Supporting Information) were observed at a source temperature of 80 °C.

Data was obtained using the Z-Spray ion source of the Waters SYNAPT
G2 with matrix 3-NBN at a source temperature of 80 °C. Details
of tentative lipid assignments are provided in Figure S12, Supporting Information. Mass spectra and drift
times of GD1 standards are provided in Figures S13 and S14, Supporting Information.

The multiply charged ions show enhanced IMS separation relative
to singly charged ions allowing for straightforward observation and
clean extraction of charge state families from the 2-dimensional plot
of drift time vs mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) (Figure 3I.B). The extracted singly charged
lipids (Figure 3II.A) were tentatively assigned
as sulfatides, phosphatidylserines,
phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidic acids, and sphingomyelins
with varying lipid chain lengths (Figure S12B.1, Supporting Information).28−31 The doubly deprotonated lipids
(Figure 3II.B) were tentatively assigned as
cardiolipins and disialogangliosides (GD1) (Figure S12B.2, Supporting Information).22,32,33 It is important to note that the analysis
of intact gangliosides by intermediate pressure LSIV and MALDI previously
failed on the same mass spectrometer.22

In addition to the separation provided by IMS, unique mobility
values can be extracted from the 2-dimensional plot and displayed
as a “nested data set” of td(m/z),34,35 which is especially important when considering species that exist
as isomers such as gangliosides.22 Each
ganglioside isomer has an individual drift time leading to the observation
of differences in mobility rather than m/z for GD1a (Figure S13I.A, Supporting Information) and GD1b (Figure S13I.B, Supporting Information) at 6.73(917.5) and 6.62(917.5),
respectively. By comparing the
drift times of the standards with the lipid detected at a drift time
of 6.73 ms in the mouse brain tissue section (Figure S14, Supporting Information), the GD1a isomer
is tentatively assigned to the doubly deprotonated ion in Figure 3II.B at m/z 917.5.

Conclusions
This work demonstrates that LSIV can be achieved on atmospheric
pressure sources using a simple modification. Heat applied to the
source is shown to be an important parameter, and it is suggested
that this will also be the case applying heat to an intermediate pressure
MALDI source. Therefore, with proper engineering, a heated LSIV source,
with laser aligned in transmission1,13 or reflection
geometry,2,11 can be constructed to take advantage of
the high ion transmission of vacuum sources relative to atmospheric
pressure sources.36 This heated LSIV source
can provide convenient and rapid sample introduction and be capable
of using volatile matrix compounds such as 3-NBN to eliminate matrix
related instrument contamination. In addition, the combination of
heat and vacuum extends the applicable mass range of previous LSIV
and LSII approaches,2,9,13,27 as well as making the method softer22 using the same mass spectrometer. The laser
aligned in transmission geometry offers speed of analysis,25 and the simple movement of the focusing lens
held at atmospheric pressure will allow high repetition mass measurements
of surfaces potentially suitable for surface imaging.10,20,22,24
