We have used systematic evolution of ligands by exponential
enrichment
(SELEX) to isolate RNA aptamers against aminoglycoside antibiotics.
The SELEX rounds were toggled against four pairs of aminoglycosides
with the goal of isolating reagents that recognize conserved structural
features. The resulting aptamers bind both of their selection targets
with nanomolar affinities. They also bind the less structurally related
targets, although they show clear specificity for this class of antibiotics.
We show that this lack of aminoglycoside specificity is a common property
of aptamers previously selected against single compounds and described
as “specific”. Broad target specificity aptamers would
be ideal for sensors detecting the entire class of aminoglycosides.
We have used ligand-induced aggregation of gold-nanoparticles coated
with our aptamers as a rapid and sensitive assay for these compounds.
In contrast to DNA aptamers, unmodified RNA aptamers cannot be used
as the recognition ligand in this assay, whereas 2′-fluoro-pyrimidine
derivatives work reliably. We discuss the possible application of
these reagents as sensors for drug residues and the challenges for
understanding the structural basis of aminoglycoside-aptamer recognition
highlighted by the SELEX results.

==== Body
Aminoglycosides (AMGs) are RNA-binding
antibiotics sharing a common core structure, the streptamine ring
(Figure 1 and Table S1, Supporting Information). They function by binding to bacterial
ribosomes, causing frame-shifting resulting in the production of nonsense
peptides, eventually leading to cell death.1 Their clinical use has been restricted due to toxic side effects,
especially to the kidneys and the ear.2 However, their low cost means that they are still often widely used
in animal husbandry leading to potential residues in the food chain.
Nucleic acid aptamers are reagents selected in vitro from degenerate
sequence libraries by their ability to bind to defined molecular targets.
Their affinities and specificities rival those of antibody reagents.3−5 They have a number of properties that make them superior to antibodies
for a range of applications, such as primary capture ligands in sensors.6−8 These include the ease with which they can be synthesized and modified
with a variety of functionalities to facilitate the production of
sensing devices. There are a large number of known aptamer sequences
with affinities for targets ranging from low molecular weight organic
species to whole cells (Table A1, A). Most of
these aptamers are based on RNA, and such molecules specific for a
number of AMGs have been reported previously, together with structural
studies investigating the molecular basis of target recognition.9−13 AMGs are being investigated as leads for novel RNA binding ligands
although there is no simple understanding of their binding specificity.

The use of veterinary medicines in animal husbandry
is regulated
to ensure that people are not exposed to harmful residues (Table A1, B,C). One element of the control system is the
targeted detection/monitoring of both banned and authorized veterinary
medicine residues in animal matrixes such as kidney, muscle, liver,
and milk.14 In the EU, Member States are
required to test many thousands (Table A1, D)
of samples per annum in analytical assays to ensure that residue levels
to do not exceed maximum residue limits (MRLs).15 The MRL is the maximum concentration (expressed in μg/kg)
of a residue that is legally permitted or acceptable in or on a food
item. These values are specified for a wide range of medicine/species/matrix
combinations. For example, in the aminoglycoside (AMG) class16 of antimicrobial compounds, MRLs range from
50 μg/kg for gentamicin in bovine/porcine muscle to 20 000
μg/kg for apramycin in bovine kidney. Despite legislation, excess
residues of AMG compounds have been reported, particularly in calf/cattle
tissues and honey (Table A1, C).

One of
the key challenges for any control system is to have efficient
and cost-effective analytical methods available for use. In the case
of antimicrobial agents, there are a number of commercially available
rapid test kits and other laboratory-based methods that utilize microbial
inhibition for the detection of, e.g., β-lactams, sulfonamides,
tetracyclines, and macrolides. The majority of these, however, either
do not detect AMGs or their detection limits are much higher than
the MRLs.17 Alternative screening/confirmation
methods based on LC-MS/MS are available,18 but these approaches are costly to operate when screening many hundreds
or thousands of samples. Furthermore, LC-MS/MS methods require highly
qualified personnel and cannot currently be used in remote locations
with limited technical services. Consequently, there is a need for
new rapid, facile, and cheap screening methods for AMGs which have
the potential for use both in the laboratory and at upstream locations,
such as at abattoirs or border inspection posts.

Gold nanoparticles
(GNPs) have been used extensively for detection
of both low molecular weight chemicals, e.g., K+,19 cocaine,20,21 adenosine,20 ATP,22 ochratoxin
A,23 oxytetracycline,24 and dopamine,25 as well as larger
targets, e.g., thrombin,26 in a number
of formats. These include combinations with DNA oligonucleotides,
including ssDNA aptamers. In their simplest format, these aptamers
are physi-sorbed to the GNP surface. This has a stabilizing effect
on the particles, reducing salt-induced aggregation which would lead
to a color change from pink to blue, due to surface plasmon resonance
coupling among neighboring particles.27 Such changes are easily observed by eye and can be quantified spectroscopically.28 To date, there are very few reports of the use
of RNA oligomers with GNPs and only as 2′-O-methyl derivatives for structure probing.29,30

Here, we have combined RNA aptamer selection against AMGs,
with
detection in a GNP assay format. Aptamers have been selected using
the systematic evolution of ligands by the exponential enrichment
(SELEX) process.7 In order to obtain reagents
specific for conserved functional groups/structures within the AMGs,
toggle SELEX31 (Figure S1, Supporting Information) was carried out by alternating between
two structurally related AMGs (referred to as toggle-pairs from here
on) in successive rounds. Aptamer selection was “front-loaded”32 to incorporate 2′-fluoro-pyrimidines
(2′-F), a modification that imparts stability against common
environmental nucleases,33 allowing their
potential use in biosensors. Our results suggest that aptamers with
broad AMG binding affinity can be isolated by this route. In the GNP
assays, physisorbed 2′-F RNA, but not natural RNAs, were able
to stabilize GNPs against aggregation allowing detection of the AMGs
in the 1–100 nM range. Surprisingly, previously reported, apparently
specific anti-AMG natural RNA aptamer sequences34,35 also bind to their targets when modified to include 2′-F
pyrimidines. They also showed broad, rather than specific, AMG recognition.
In some cases, 2′-F modification had little or no effect on
affinity, while for other AMGs there are >10-fold changes between
the two forms of the aptamer. Despite these unexpected findings, our
data suggest that combining GNP sensing with 2′-F equivalents
of the many known RNA aptamers would provide a rapid sensing system
for a wide range of analytes.

Materials and Methods
Unless indicated, general laboratory
reagents including the AMGs
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Dorset, UK) and were the highest
grade available. All assay kits were used as per the manufacturers’
instructions unless stated otherwise. AMGs were biotinylated as described
in Supporting Information (Table S2). Gold
nanoparticles (26 nm dia.) were prepared by standard methods (see Supporting Information)

SELEX and Cloning
The initial dsDNA library consists
of approximately 1015 sequences, each containing an N30 random region, flanked by fixed primer regions; one of which
carries the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Aptamer selections were carried
out on a Biomek 2000 liquid handling system, using protocols based
on those described in detail elsewhere.4,36 In order to
isolate aptamers which recognize the features common among the AMGs,
a series of toggle selections were performed as described previously.31 The toggle pairs were as follows; gentamicin
with apramycin, kanamycin with tobramycin, and paromomycin with neomycin.
The toggle partner for streptomycin (dihydrostreptomycin) could not
be successfully immobilized, so no toggle was carried out during that
selection. PBS supplemented with 10% (v/v) methanol was used for all
binding and washing steps. Further information can be found in the Supporting Information.

Analysis of SELEX Products
Biotinylated AMGs were immobilized
on streptavidin coated plate wells (Roche Products Ltd., Welwyn, UK)
by incubation at excess in PBS overnight at 4 °C on an orbital
shaker. Unbound biotinylated AMGs were removed by copious washing
with PBS. Twenty-five μL of 600 nM anti-AMG aptamers were incubated
with the immobilized targets overnight, and the unbound sequences
were washed away with selection buffer. Bound sequences were eluted
by heat into nuclease free water, reverse transcribed, amplified and
cloned using the materials outlined for SELEX and cloning. This amplified
product was then diluted 1 in 5 in nuclease free water and analyzed
using the 5k DNA assay chip, run on a Caliper GX II capillary electrophoresis
system.

Determination of Minimum RNA Chemical Variant Concentration
for GNP Stabilization
In a series of 50 mL falcon tubes,
5× master mixes were made where one reaction contained the following:
30 μL of the 26 nm GNP (see Supporting Information for preparation method) stock (0.24 nM final concentration), RNA
at the appropriate concentration, and deionized water to make up the
final volume to 50 μL. A series of concentrations (1–20
nM) of the 2′-F, 2′-OH, and 2′-NH2 RNA variants were made and incubated overnight at room temperature
in the dark. The following day, 50 μL of the master mix was
added to 50 μL of deionized water in an Iwaki polystyrene, flat
bottomed, 96 well plate (the type of plate used affected the speed
of the color change). To the 100 μL GNP/aptamer reaction, 6.5
μL of 1 M NaCl was added (61 mM final) and quickly mixed. The
amount of salt used was the minimum concentration required to aggregate
the gold nanoparticles when no RNA is present (Figure S2, Supporting Information). After 10 min, the absorbance
spectrum for each well was scanned between 530 and 650 nm. The 650/530
nm ratio (A650/A530) was then plotted against RNA concentration.

Detection of Aminoglycosides with the GNP-Aptamer Sensor
Master mixes were used where possible to reduce sample–sample
variation. Each assay contained: 30 μL of 26 nm gold (0.24 nM),
5 nM 2′-F aptamer, and deionized water up to 50 μL. The
master mix was incubated overnight, in the dark, at room temperature
to allow the aptamer to saturate the GNPs. AMG detection assays were
performed on a Biomek 2000 liquid handing robot with 96 well plates
(Iwaki); 2-fold serial dilutions of 1 μM AMGs were made in deionized
water to 15.6 nM, and 50 μL was mixed with 50 μL of aptamer-GNP
master mix. Finally, 6.5 μL of 1 M NaCl (61 mM final concentration)
was then added to each well and rapidly mixed. After incubation for
20 min, the plates were moved to a POLARstar Galaxy plate reader (BMG
Labtech, Germany) and scanned at 530 and 650 nm and the A650/A530 was plotted against
AMG concentration.

Aptamer SPR
All SPR experiments were carried out on
a BIAcore 3000 system (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). Aptamer
sequences were prepared and purified by phenol chloroform extraction
and ethanol precipitation. Samples were then resuspended in DEPC treated
water and desalted using G25 Sephadex spin columns (GE Healthcare,
Buckinghamshire, UK) and then dialyzed against their respective selections
buffers overnight at 4 °C. Monobiotinylated AMGs were immobilized
to ∼500 RU on SA-sensor (Streptavidin) chips (GE Healthcare,
Buckinghamshire, UK) in PBS following preconditioning buffer injections.
One flow-cell was left “blank” on each chip for background
correction, and monobiotinylated tobramycin was included on each chip
for control purposes. Selection buffers were used to equilibrate the
chips for a minimum of 2 h prior to sample injections.

Thermal Melting of AMG-Aptamer Complexes
Aptamers were
incubated with target AMGs, each 800 nM, for 30 min and then diluted
to 400 nM in warmed urea solution (final concentration 6 M). Absorbance
at 260 nm was recorded during a cycled gradient of 25 to 90 °C
(1 °C/min gradient), and data were corrected for background and
plotted as the percentage change in absorbance at 260 nm.

Results and Discussion
RNA SELEX Against AMG Targets
We used toggle SELEX
to probe the recognition of conserved functional groups in pairs of
AMG targets known to be likely food contaminants (Figures 1 and S1, Supporting Information). AMGs were modified with NHS-PEG12-biotin using standard
amide forming chemistry, resulting in mono- and dibiotinylated AMG
products (as detected by LC-TOF-MS), for all but streptomycin and
dihydrostreptomycin. The PEG linker was used to minimize steric hindrance
for aptamer binding. Streptomycin was successfully biotinylated using
a hydrazide-PEG4-biotin which reacts with the sole aldehyde
group differentiating streptomycin from dihydrostreptomycin. As it
was not possible to modify and immobilize dihydrostreptomycin, aptamers
were raised against streptomycin alone (not toggle-selected as for
the other AMGs). The biotinylated AMGs were immobilized on streptavidin-coated
magnetic beads, then washed, and resuspended in PBS. LC-TOF-MS was
then used to estimate the levels of free biotinylated AMG before and
after incubation with the beads and after a subsequent 100-fold molar
excess of biotin to compete off bound species. As expected, biotinylated
AMGs were only detected before incubation with beads and after biotin
competition. These data suggest the targets were immobilized successfully.

The selection buffer consisted of PBS containing methanol, present
to mimic a food extract which commonly would contain this reagent.
Automated SELEX was carried out using a Biomek 2000 liquid handling
system (Beckman Coulter) using previously established protocols.4,36−38 The naive (N30) library of 2′-F oligonucleotides
was exposed to underivatized beads prior to positive selection in
each of the first 5 rounds of SELEX in order to remove nonspecific
binders. The toggle-pairs of immobilized AMGs were as follows, gentamicin
with apramycin, kanamycin with tobramycin, and paromomycin with neomycin
(Figure 1). The selection target was alternated
at each round of selection (Figure S1, Supporting
Information), e.g., round 1 was against gentamicin, round 2
was against apramycin, round 3 was against gentamicin, and so on.
The resulting aptamer populations were denoted LGA#, LPN#, and LKT#,
i.e., Leeds derived aptamer against Gentamicin and Apramycin, clone number, etc. Since streptomycin selection occurred
without toggle rounds, its aptamers were designated LS#. AMG binding
RNAs were eluted by thermal denaturation during the first 5 SELEX
rounds and then by competition with the AMG selection targets. The
streptomycin selection was identical except that alternating rounds
were eluted by competition with streptomycin or dihydrostreptomycin.
As the SELEX rounds progressed, the stringency was increased by reducing
the amount of selection target, reducing incubation times with the
RNA pools, and increasing the number and length of washing steps.
Gel electrophoresis (Figure S3, Supporting Information) of the amplified selected products confirmed that selection had
been successful.

Analysis of SELEX Products
The aptamer pools were then
cloned, and twenty clones from each selection pool were sequenced
(Table S3, Supporting Information). Sequence
alignment between pools using AliBee (Table A1, E) did not identify obvious conserved extended binding motifs nor
was there any homology to known AMG specific aptamers described previously.34,35 The results are consistent with isolation of novel AMG binding aptamers
as expected. The AMG recognition properties of all the individual
sequences were then tested for target specificity in a high-throughput
pull-down assay using 96-well streptavidin-coated plates. Individual,
biotinylated AMGs were immobilized in each well of a plate and then
incubated with ∼600 nM RNA aptamers overnight. After thorough
washing, the remaining bound RNAs were eluted by thermal denaturation,
amplified by RT-PCR, and the amount of binding was estimated from
the intensity of signals in a capillary electrophoretogram. The GA
and KT toggle pairs produced the most binders, whereas the PN selection
did not apparently produce any binders. Some of the isolated aptamers
also showed some binding to the linker. A couple of aptamers that
only bound AMGs, one showing fairly specific binding, LGA11 (although
not for its selection target), and one exhibiting broad specificity
(LS13) and with the highest relative affinities, were then chosen
for additional characterization (Tables 1 and
S4, Supporting Information).

a The amounts of DNA fragments generated
from aptamers eluted from each of the targets in the 96 well plate
were semiquantitatively assessed from their peak areas on a capillary
electrophoresis trace: (−) no products observed (equivalent
to no AMG binding); (+), (++), and (+++) correspond to increasing
amounts of DNA and should therefore correlate with increased aptamer
binding and affinity. Here and in all the other tables, AMGs are referred
to by their initial letters. L represents the PEG12-biotin
linker reagent used for modification of the AMGs.

From the results, it appears that individual aptamers
exhibit large
variability in their AMG recognition patterns. The selected sequences
mostly have broad specificity for many AMGs rather than for individual
AMGs, suggesting that the toggle selection had successfully isolated
aptamers recognizing generic features, although these were not restricted
to the toggle pairs. Surprisingly, an aptamer reported previously
to be selective for tobramycin, TOBR12CA, showed similar promiscuous
AMG recognition when produced as a 2′-F-pyrimidine derivative.
The solution secondary structures of LGA11 and LS13 were then determined
by enzymatic structure probing (Figure S4, Supporting
Information). The results are consistent with the idea that
novel anti-AMG aptamer motifs have been isolated. Aptamers LGA11 and
LS13 were selected for incorporation into a GNP-based assay system.

Development of GNP Colorimetric Assays
We have previously
demonstrated that the sensitivity of ssDNA aptamer-GNP assays can
be improved by working with the minimum amount of DNA required to
protect the GNPs from salt-induced aggregation (unpublished data).
Under these conditions, the addition of sub-KD quantities of target analyte displaces enough aptamer from
the GNP to permit aggregation. GNP-aptamer assays are illustrated
in cartoon form in Figure S5, Supporting Information. In such assays, the detection limit for lysozyme using an aptamer
with a KD ∼ 31 nM37 was ∼4 nM. This compares to a detection limit for
thrombin in a nonoptimized assay21 of 83
nM with an aptamer KD of ∼0.5 nM.

Initial assay development for AMG detection was carried out using
the TOBR12CA aptamer.34 Transcripts encompassing
the TOBR12CA were produced as per Goertz et al.,34 using 2′-OH NTPs, and tested for their ability to
stabilize the GNPs. It proved impossible to find a stabilizing RNA
concentration below 20 nM, in contrast to the widespread use of 2′-deoxy-oligonucleotides
for this purpose. There is evidence that the nucleotide bases are
the principal feature that results in immobilization on citrate-stabilized
GNPs,27 but the hydrophobicity and/or conformational
preferences of the sugar residue may also play a role. Since our anti-AMG
aptamers were 2′-F modified at pyrimidines, we compared GNP
stabilization with TOBR12CA transcripts produced using 2′-OH,
2′-amino (2′-NH2), or 2′-F modified
pyrimidines. 2′-F and 2′-NH2 modified RNAs
both stabilized the GNPs at ∼5 nM, whereas 2′-OH RNA
did not (Figure 2). It appears that the 2′-OH
groups may prevent physi-sorption to the gold surface and that this
can be overcome by substitution of the pyrimidine riboses with more
hydrophobic functional groups. This observation is consistent with
previous reports where 2′-O-methyl RNA transcripts
on GNPs were used as probes of RNA secondary structure.29,30 In order to explore whether the secondary structures of the RNAs
were important for stabilization, we assayed a range of oligonucleotides
carrying 2′-F modifications at pyrimidines, ranging in length
from 19 to 121 nts, and encompassing either only a stem-loop or a
mixture of base-paired and single-stranded regions. The results (Figure
S6A, Supporting Information) show that
there is little difference between these oligos implying that it is
the sugar residue modification that is the critical feature of the
physi-sorption step.

Figure 2 Stabilization of gold nanoparticles with variant RNAs.

GNP stabilization experiments using 2′-OH,
2′-NH2, and 2′-F modified RNA were analyzed
spectroscopically.
Different concentrations of each aptamer were mixed with 26 nm GNPs
at 0.24 nM and incubated overnight (room temperature, in the dark).
61 mM NaCl (final concentration) was then added, and the samples were
equilibrated for a further 20 min; the absorbance at 530 and 650 nm
was measured. The ratio of A650/A530 is a useful diagnostic of GNP aggregation.
The dashed line in the graph highlights the ratio at which the visible
color change occurs: above the line the solutions are blue, and below
it they are red.

As a further control, we also prepared transcripts
encompassing
the streptomycin binding aptamer, SB84.35 Again, this control aptamer was initially selected using 2′-OH
nucleotides, but we produced it with 2′-F modified pyrimidines,
in the hope that some AMG-binding activity would remain. The control
aptamer and LGA11 and LS13 transcripts stabilized the GNPs at ∼5
nM, and this was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (Figure
S6B,C, Supporting Information). Although
RNA-GNP incubation times as long as 18 h were often used for convenience,
we have shown that stabilization is very rapid and is complete after
5 min. Furthermore, once stabilized, the GNPs were stable at room
temperature in the dark and showed identical ligand binding properties
for at least 6 months.

Figure 3A shows
the result of GNP-LGA11
assays for apramycin (red) and gentamicin (blue). The buffer control
in the absence of analyte is shown as black symbols. LGA11 clearly
binds to both of its selection targets but with differing apparent
affinities. Apramycin binding was detectable, using spectroscopy at
low nM concentrations and was visibly red by ∼62.5 nM. In contrast,
gentamicin binding is not apparent until ≥100 nM and is not
detectable by the eye until ∼250 nM. The reason for these different
affinities is not obvious from the structures or physical properties
of either AMG (Table S1, Supporting Information). Both would be expected to carry 5 positive charges under our assay
conditions and have similar numbers of hydrogen bond donor groups
(11 for apramycin vs 8 for gentamicin). It appears therefore that
the toggle SELEX was successful. However, given the lack of specificity
suggested in the pull down assays (Table 1),
we assayed LGA11’s ability to detect the other AMGs (Figure 3 B, C). All AMGs were detectable at concentrations
below 500 nM, except streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin. Strikingly,
the aptamer showed higher sensitivity for neomycin than for either
of its selection targets, displaying a color change at ∼50
nM (Figure 3C), consistent with the pull down
assay. Tobramycin and paromomycin had binding profiles similar to
apramycin, and the cognate gentamicin was the least well recognized
with the LGA11 aptamer. These results do not seem to follow any obvious
trend based on the chemical structures and properties of the AMGs
(Table S1, Supporting Information). They
are, however, due to specific recognition of the AMGs by the aptamer,
since GNPs stabilized with the naïve starting pool RNAs show
no binding below 125 nM AMG concentrations (Figure S7, Supporting Information).

Figure 3 GNP-aptamer sensor detection
of aminoglycosides. Shows the results
of the GNP-LGA11 aptamer assay against the selection targets gentamicin
and apramycin (A) and against 8 aminoglycosides (B). (C) shows chart
B, but it is expanded for clarity.

Given the apparent promiscuity of our AMG aptamers
and the poor
recognition of the streptomycin targets by LGA11, we then screened
LS13 and both control aptamers against all AMG SELEX targets (Figure 4). In order to increase throughput and reproducibility,
the assay was adapted to a 96 well plate format and carried out on
a Biomek 2000 liquid handling robot. Remarkably, 2′-F pyrimidine
modified TOBR12CA aptamer retained its affinity for tobramycin but
was also able to detect all the other AMGs, except the streptomycin
compounds (Figure 4 A). The greatest sensitivity
was shown for kanamycin with the poorest binding for gentamicin and
dihydrostreptomycin. Binding to streptomycin only becomes apparent
at ∼500 nM. This cross-reactivity in an aptamer reported to
have been selected against a single AMG target suggests that our result
with LGA11 is likely to be common for anti-AMG aptamers. Indeed, this
seemed to be true for the GNP-SB84 assay, which failed to detect either
of its original cognate targets at concentrations <500 nM but bound
all the other targets with roughly similar affinities in the 50 nM
range (Figure 4B). The behavior of the GNP-LS13
version of the sensor was consistent with these results (Figure 4C) showing binding to all SELEX targets, except
the streptomycins, and with the noncognate kanamycin being the best
recognized. Binding appears specific for this class of compound since
no binding was seen with the unrelated compounds, tetracycline, ampicillin,
ATP, BSA, and the PEG12 biotin linker. (The data for LGA11
binding to these reagents is representative and is shown in Figure
S8, Supporting Information.)

Figure 4 Promiscuity of aminoglycoside
binding by GNP-aptamer sensors. 2′-F
modified TOBR12CA (A), SB84 (B), and LS13 (C) against a panel of 8
AMGs at concentrations ranging from 0 to 500 nM (see key). Expansions
of the 0–125 nM binding curves are shown on the right. The
vertical red line shows the MRL value for gentamicin which is the
lowest of all the AMGs tested.

It is surprising that the streptomycins were so
poorly detected
in these assays especially by aptamer sequences selected against the
parent compound. SB84 is reported to have a KD for its cognate target of 1 μM.35 The difference with the promiscuous binding to the other
AMGs is suggestive of a different type of interaction. This is consistent
with the reported structure of the streptomycin complex with an RNA
based on a sequence selected by Wallace and Schroeder35 which reveals that the AMG is completely encased within
the RNA.39 That aptamer was also selected
in the presence of magnesium ions, which were not present in our assays.
We therefore repeated the GNP-aptamer assays with LS13, TOBR12CA,
and SB84 across a wider concentration range (1–6 μM)
and in the presence or absence of magnesium ions (Figure S9, Supporting Information). The results show that
both streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin can be detected readily
in this format.

The highest affinity for the streptomycins is
with TOBR12CA, which
was visibly blue at ≥500 nM, but all aptamers were saturated
by 1.5 μM. TOBR12CA binding was largely unaffected by the presence
of magnesium ions while LGA11 and, remarkably, SB84 were less sensitive
in the presence of the divalent metal ion than in its absence.

Validating the GNP Assay
In order to be able to compare
the results of the GNP assays with other well established binding
assays, surface plasmon resonance (SPR)40,41 was used to
determine the KDs of each aptamer in their
selection buffer for the various AMGs. Prior to immobilization on
streptavidin sensor chips, the biotinylated AMGs used for selection
were further purified using reverse phase HPLC, to isolate monobiotinylated
AMGs (final purity >95%) in order to reduce the heterogeneity of
the
interactions being observed. The amount of immobilized ligand was
kept constant (±5%) for all AMGs. The data were analyzed by fitting
the association and dissociation phases separately using the BIAevaluation
3.0 software (Table 2). KD values for LGA11 and LS13 were in the range of ∼10–100
nM for all of the AMGs, including streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin
which were poorly detected in the GNP assays. TOBR12CA showed some
binding to all AMGs with affinities ranging from ∼2–600
nM for either the 2′-F or 2′-OH forms. SB84 bound some
AMGs with affinities in the low nM range and others in the μM
range, i.e., it is much more specific for neomycin and paromomycin,
with some recognition of streptomycin and tobramycin under these conditions
(Table 2). The aptamers selected here recognize
all AMGs in the low nM range; i.e., they appear to be recognizing
a generic feature.

a Analysis of anti-AMG aptamer-ligand
affinities. The apparent kinetic parameters for aptamers in their
selection buffers binding to immobilized monobiotinylated AMGs were
determined using the BIAevaluation software, assuming a 1:1 interaction
model. Aptamers SB84 and TOBR12CA were analyzed as both 2′-OH
and 2′-F RNA. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constants
are listed from the values of kass and kdiss. The standard errors (SE) were calculated
from the SEs of kass and kdiss.

The SPR experiments confirm promiscuous AMG binding
by the toggle
aptamers, even though their binding profiles differ slightly. In both
the pull down and SPR assays, recognition is occurring with an immobilized
partner. In order to confirm that such promiscuous binding also occurs
in solution, we used melting curve profiles (Figure S10, Supporting Information) of 2′-F modified
TOBR12CA and LGA11 in the presence of different AMGs. The transcripts
for these experiments are 80 nt long, 2′-F modified RNAs which
would be expected to have high Tms and
be capable of forming several differing conformations in solution,
leading to complex unfolding curves. In order to ensure that the RNA
secondary structures would be completely unfolded at high temperature,
we conducted these experiments in urea which reduces the Tm of melting but does not alter the unfolding/folding
pathway.42 The aptamers still showed complex
unfolding curves in the absence of AMGs, but in their presence, the
differing AMGs resulted in unfolding curves with differing Tms depending on the AMG present. With the exception
of the effects on the melting of LGA11 by streptomycin, the stabilization
effects mirror expectations based on the GNP assays (Figures 3A and 4). The streptomycins
are poorly recognized in the GNP assays but bind much tighter in SPR
(Table 2). The solution behavior is therefore
closer to the result obtained with the GNP-RNA aptamer assays.

These data demonstrate the potential of GNP-RNA aptamer sensors
for rapid and cheap detection of low molecular weight analytes, such
as the AMGs. Although a number of apparently specific anti-AMG aptamers
have been reported previously, no other aptamers selected for broad
specificity are currently known. The lack of sequence and/or secondary
structure motif matches in the final selection pools obtained here
(Table S3 and Figure S4, Supporting Information) suggests that the structure–function space for AMG recognition
is far from exhausted. This is perhaps to be expected from the wide
range of known natural RNA targets for these compounds.40 The molecular basis of AMG recognition by RNA
is also complex.43 This may account for
the lack of consistency in some of the binding assays reported here.
The GNP assay is perhaps the most complex of these requiring adsorbed
aptamers to dissociate, fold into the ligand binding conformation,
and form a complex. Various equilibria are involved in the end result,
but for a sensor the critical issue is sensitive ligand detection;
here, we have demonstrated facile detection of the AMGs down to the
minimum MRL value. The ease of coupling the aptamers with the GNPs
suggests that there will be many other applications of this approach.
