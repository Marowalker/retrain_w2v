Spectrally
resolved ultraviolet (UV) absorption cross sections
of SO2 in combustion environments at temperatures from
1120 to 1950 K were measured for the first time in well-controlled
conditions through applying broad band UV absorption spectroscopy
in specially designed one-dimensional laminar flat flames. The temperature
was observed to have a significant effect on the absorption cross-section
profiles at wavelength shorter than 260 nm, while at the longer wavelength
side, the absorption cross-section profiles have much less dependence
on temperature. The absorption cross section at 277.8 nm with a value
of 0.68 × 10–18 cm2/molecule was
suggested for the evaluation of the SO2 concentration because
of the weak dependence on temperature. To make spatially resolved
measurements, laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) of SO2 excited
by a 266 nm laser was investigated. Spectrally resolved LIF signal
was analyzed at different temperatures. The LIF signal showed strong
dependence on temperature, which can potentially be used for temperature
measurements. At elevated temperatures, spatially resolved LIF SO2 detection up to a few ppm sensitivity was achieved. Combining
UV broad band absorption spectroscopy and LIF, highly sensitive and
spatially resolved quantitative measurements of SO2 in
the combustion environment can be achieved.

==== Body
Sulfur chemistry plays a key
role in the combustion/gasification of many solid fuels.1,2 In the chemical reaction loops, one of the dominate sulfur compounds
is sulfur dioxide (SO2), which affects thermal conversion
processes of fuels by interacting with the O/H radicals.3 SO2 released from furnaces and combustors
is also an important contribution to the air pollution.4 Hence, it is essential to perform quantitative
SO2 detection in combustion environments for comprehensive
understandings of the reaction processes. Optical diagnostics, including
broad band ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectroscopy,5−10 laser-induced fluorescence (LIF),11 and
tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS),12 have been widely employed for the measurement of SO2, which permit real-time and highly sensitive monitoring.

UV absorption spectroscopy is a reliable and low-cost method providing
quantitative measurements of SO2. For reliable quantitative
measurements, accurate UV absorption cross sections of SO2 are essential, which have been the research focus of many studies,5,7 and it was found that the absorption cross sections could be affected
strongly by temperature, as investigated by Vandaele et al.,5 Vattulainen et al.,6 Grosch et al.,7 Mellqvist and Rosén,8 and Hippler et al.13 However, except for Hippler et al.,13 who have investigated the UV absorption spectrum of SO2 over the temperature range 800–4000 K in shock-wave experiments,
most UV absorption cross sections are available only for the temperature
up to 1073 K,6 which cannot satisfy the
measurements in normal combustion/gasification environments with a
temperature varying from 1000 to 2000 K. Hence, one focus of the present
work was on obtaining accurate UV absorption cross sections of SO2 in combustion environments at 1120–1950 K.

UV
absorption spectroscopy is limited to its line-of-sight nature
and cannot provide spatially resolved information. To achieve spatially
resolved SO2 measurement with high sensitivity, LIF can
be adopted using lasers at different wavelengths (∼170 to ∼338
nm) in the UV absorption region.14 To avoid
low fluorescence quantum yield due to predissociation, a wavelength
threshold located near 200 nm was suggested.15 Rollins et al.14 developed a LIF instrument
using the fifth harmonic of a tunable diode laser with a wavelength
of 216.9 nm for measurements of SO2 in the upper troposphere
and lower stratosphere with a precision of 2 ppt. Matsumi et al.11 used the second harmonics of an optical parametric
oscillator pumped by the third harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser at around
220 nm to achieve SO2 measurements with a sensitivity of
5 ppt. Fotakis et al.16 have used the KrF
laser (248 nm) to have a two-photon UV excitation of SO2 for the laser-induced fluorescence from SO. Zhang et al.17 investigated the fluorescence emission of SO2 at room temperature with an excitation source of the fourth
harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser at 266 nm. Sick18 and Honza et al.19 also measured the
fluorescence signal of SO2 with the excitation of 266 nm
laser, and they found that the signal had a strong dependence on the
temperature. Much stronger emission could be obtained in an atmosphere
at higher temperature. This characteristic might provide benefits
to the study of combustion environments with a high temperature. However,
detailed information on the relationship between fluorescence emission
and the temperature is still lacking. In our work, this correlation
was obtained, and was used in the evaluation of the SO2 concentration.

At the end, these two techniques, that is,
broad band UV absorption
spectroscopy and LIF, were compared for their application in SO2 measurement in a combustion atmosphere, and the combination
of these two techniques were discussed, aiming at the spatially resolved
quantitative measurement of SO2.

Experimental Section
Burner
and Flame Conditions
A laminar flame multijet
burner was used to provide different homogeneous hot gas environments
with varying temperatures and fuel/air equivalence ratios. The flame
cases adopted in the present study are summarized in Table 1. The temperature of the hot
flue gas was varied from 1120 to 1950 K, which were measured through
the two-line atomic fluorescence thermometry with indium atoms, as
reported by Borggren et al.20 The global
equivalence ratio of the introduced gas was varied from 0.63 to 1.32,
to produce different oxidative or reductive hot gas environments.
The details of the burner were introduced by Weng et al.21 As shown in Figure 1a, it consisted of two chambers, that is,
jet chamber and coflow chamber. The jet chamber was used to mix the
premixed gases, CH4/air/O2, and introduce it
evenly to the 181 jet tubes to form laminar flames for producing the
hot flue gases. The coflow chamber was used to provide the coflows,
N2/air, which surrounded the premixed jet flames evenly.
In the present work, SO2 (1% of SO2 in N2) was introduced into the hot flue gas through the jet flows
as shown in Figure 1a. The measurements were conducted at 5 mm above the outlet of the
burner. The outlet had a size of 85 × 47 mm. All flows were controlled
by mass flow controllers with an accuracy of 0.5% × reading +
0.1% × full scale (Bronkhorst).

setup including (b) the broad band UV absorption spectroscopy system
and (c) the 266 nm laser-induced fluorescence system.

UV Absorption Spectroscopy
The schematic of the broad
band UV absorption spectroscopy system is shown in Figure 1b. The UV light from a deuterium
lamp was collimated by a parabolic mirror with a reflected focal length
of 152 mm to form a light beam with a diameter of around 1 cm. The
light beam passed through the hot flue gas with its center 5 mm above
the burner using five UV-enhanced aluminum mirrors. The light was
collected by a collimator and analyzed by a spectrometer (USB 2000+,
Ocean Optics) with a spectral resolution of about 0.4 nm. The accumulation
time of the spectrometer was set to 1 s. The total path length was
estimated on the basis of the distribution of the LIF signal of SO2 excited by a 266 nm laser (see Figure 2b), which will be illustrated in the following
section.

Figure 2 Typical image (a) and the horizontal distribution (b) of the laser-induced
fluorescence signal of SO2 excited by the 266 nm laser
beam passing above the burner.

Laser-Induced Fluorescence System
As shown in Figure 1c, a 266 nm laser
with a pulse energy of about 28 mJ/pulse was provided by the fourth
harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser. The collimated laser beam with a diameter
of around 8 mm was guided through the hot flue gas zone with its beam
center around 5 mm above the outlet of the burner. The 266 nm laser
excited SO2 to produce broad band UV fluorescence, and
the fluorescence was collected by an ICCD camera (Princeton Instruments,
Model PI-MAX3, 1024 × 1024 pixels) through a long pass filter,
WG305, which was used to block the laser scattering signal. The camera
had an exposure time of 50 ns. The typical image of the LIF signal
of SO2 is presented in Figure 2a. The horizontal distribution of the signal
in the region marked by the dash line box is presented in Figure 2b, and it was used
to calculate the total path length of the UV light in the hot flue
gas as shown in Figure 1b. The decrease of the signal at the edge of the flue gas was mainly
caused by the lower local temperature and SO2 concentration
with the entrainment of ambient air. Moreover, a spectrometer (Andor,
Model Shamrock 750, f/9.7) with a grating of 300
lines/mm was adopted for the analysis of the spectrum of the fluorescence
from 190 to 350 nm with a spectral resolution of around 0.055 nm.

Results and Discussion
UV Absorption Spectroscopy of SO2
To apply
UV absorption spectroscopy for quantitative measurements of SO2 in high-temperature environments, the UV absorption cross
section, σ(λ), of SO2 at different wavelength
λ and temperature is needed. In the present study, the absorption
cross section at the temperature varying from 1120 to 1950 K is obtained
based on the Beer-Lambert law: 1  where A is the absorbance,
which is derived from Is(λ) and I0(λ), that is, the UV light intensity
after the passage of the hot flue gas with and without SO2 seeding, respectively; N is the molecular number
density of SO2; and L is the total optical
path length which was evaluated to be 0.488 m. The errors in the calculation
of the absorption cross section of SO2 mainly originated
from the evaluation of the number density and the path length. The
error of the SO2 number density introduced from mass flow
controllers was less than ±1% according to the specified accuracy.
The decrease of SO2 concentration and temperature at the
edge of the hot flue gas (see Figure 2b) due to the entrainment of ambient air could influence
the homogeneity and introduce errors to the spectrum, especially at
the wavelengths where the absorption cross section was sensitive to
the temperature.

In the present study, SO2 was mixed
in the unburnt premixed jet flow and introduced into the burner. The
spectrally resolved absorbance of SO2 in the hot flue gas
was obtained as described in the previous investigation,22 which was the natural logarithm of the ratio
between the intensity of the UV light after the passage of the hot
flue gas in cases with and without SO2 seeding (see eq 1). The typical absorbance
of SO2 obtained in the hot flue gas is presented in Figure 3. The hot flue gas
was provided by fuel-lean flames T2O1–T2O4 and T5O1–T2O4,
with a variation in temperature and oxygen volume rate. The number
density of SO2 in the hot flue gas was kept constant at
6.2 × 1015 cm–3, which was evaluated
based on the concentration of SO2 in the unburnt premixed
gas. It was assumed that almost all the sulfur was in the form of
SO2 in the lean flames according to the chemical equilibrium
calculation, where over 99% of sulfur was in the form of SO2.23 This assumption was supported by the
phenomenon that the absorbance value was independent from the equivalence
ratio for the cases which had the same temperature but varying equivalence
ratios, as shown in Figure 3. With the known number density of SO2 in the hot
flue gas and the total path length, the UV absorption cross sections
of SO2 at certain temperatures were calculated from corresponding
absorbance using eq 1.

Figure 3 Absorbance of SO2 with a constant number density in
the hot flue gas provided by different lean flames at around 1750
K (T2O1–T2O4) and around 1260 K (T5O1–T5O4).

The UV absorption cross sections of SO2 at temperatures
from 1120 to 1950 K as the function of wavelength from 230 to 350
nm are presented in Figure 4, together with the absorption cross sections at room temperature
(296 K). All absorption spectra have a similar structure with a broad
band absorption peak at the wavelength of around 290 nm, which was
mainly attributed to the Ã(1A2) ←
X̃ (1A1) transition forming the structured
bands and the B̃(1B1) ← X̃(1A1) transition forming the “continuous”
absorption in the range 240–340 nm.5 At room temperature, the absorption cross sections obtained here
are very close to the ones reported by Vandaele et al.5 and other references therein. As the temperature is increased
over 1120 K, the line structures on the broad absorption band disappeared.
The absorption cross sections increased with temperature, especially
in the low wavelength region, for example, the wavelength below 260
nm. There is a strong absorption in the range 170–230 nm corresponding
to the C̃(1B2) ← X̃ (1A1) transition.5 At
elevated temperature, this band becomes broader. Consequently, the
absorption up to 266 nm is significantly increased compared to the
room temperature case in Figure 4. For example, at 250 nm, the absorption cross section
increases from ∼0.1 × 10–18 to ∼0.9
× 10–18 cm2/molecule as the temperature
rose from room temperature to 1950 K. However, around 280 nm, the
changes were shown to be very small, especially around 277.8 nm; a
constant absorption cross section, that is, 0.68 × 10–18 cm2/molecule, was obtained. This phenomenon at elevated
temperature was also observed by Grosch et al.,7 Vattulainen et al.,6 and Hippler
et al.13 The absorption cross section at
277.8 nm obtained in the present investigation is close to the one
obtained by Grosch et al.7 at 773 K and
Vattulainen et al.6 at 1073 K and 4 bar,
with a value of ∼0.7 × 10–18 and ∼0.8
× 10–18 cm2/molecule, respectively.
It is much larger than the value 0.28 × 10–18 cm2/molecule reported by Hippler et al.13 at 1500 and 2000 K with shock-wave heating.

Figure 4 UV absorption cross sections
of SO2 at room temperature
and the temperature varying from 1120 to 1950 K. Typical standard
deviations from 10 independent measurements at 250 and 277.8 nm are
marked in the spectral curve.

In addition, the cross sections at wavelengths of 250 and 277.8
nm with different temperatures are presented in Figure 5. It can be seen that the absorption cross
section at 250 nm increased with temperature while the one at 277.8
nm has almost a constant value. The ratios of the cross section at
250 nm to the cross section at 277.8 nm are shown in Figure 5. It can be well fitted by
a parabolic curve. On the basis of the ratios, which are sensitive
to the temperature, optical thermometry can be developed for in situ
temperature measurement.

nm with varying temperature, and the ratios between them with the
corresponding parabolic fitting line.

To have a concentration measurement of SO2 without the
effect of temperature, the absorption cross section at the wavelength
of 277.8 nm was used for the concentration evaluation in the following
studies. With use of this absorption cross section, the concentration
of SO2 in hot flue gas provided by the flame T2O2 (T = 1750 K, ϕ = 0.74) was measured
as a different amount of SO2 was mixed in the unburnt premixed
gas. The results are shown in Figure 6 and standard deviations observed in measurements were
almost constant. The standard deviation from 10 independent measurements
was analyzed to be around 10 ppm, where each measurement had an integrating
time of 1 s. Hence, a conservatively estimated precision was obtained
with a lower concentration of SO2; for example, the relative
uncertainty could be around 10% with 100 ppm SO2.

Figure 6 Concentration
measurement with a different amount of SO2 in the hot flue
gas provided by the flame T2O2 (T = 1750 K, ϕ
= 0.74).

As discussed above, the concentration
of SO2 in fuel-lean
combustion environment can be well measured by the UV absorption technique.
However, in fuel-rich environments, other sulfur species, such as
H2S, CS2, OCS, and S2, could be formed.23 These species also have UV absorption in the
same wavelength region as SO2, which could influence the
accuracy of SO2 measurement. Hence, the measurement of
SO2 in fuel-rich flames was also investigated. The absorbance
in the hot flue gas provided by the fuel-rich flame T2O7 (T = 1750 K, ϕ = 1.32) with seeding of 1500 ppm SO2 are presented in Figure 7. As the SO2 was seeded into the rich flame
conditions, similar absorption curves were obtained. However, some
extra absorption structures with multipeaks were observed, which indicates
that some other sulfur species contributed to the absorption. At around
290 nm, the absorption cross section of H2S (∼5
× 10–20 cm2/molecule), OCS (2 ×
10–20 cm2/molecule), and CS2 (1 × 10–20 cm2/molecule) at 773
K reported by Grosch et al.24 and the absorption
cross section of S2 at 298 K reported by Sarka et al.25 were significantly smaller than the one of SO2 shown in Figure 4. The absorption at around 290 nm in Figure 7 was mostly attributed to SO2.
Hence, on the basis of the value at 290 nm, the absorbance in Figure 7 was fitted by the
absorption cross-section spectrum of SO2 at 1750 K (see Figure 4) with a concentration
of 1290 ppm, which indicates that, as 1500 ppm SO2 was
seeded into the hot reductive environment, there was about 86% of
SO2 remaining. In a comparison of the raw data of the absorbance
and the fitting curve to those from SO2, some differences
were observed, especially at around 260 nm. This was caused by the
absorption of other sulfur species. The subtraction between the raw
data and the fitting curve was conducted and is presented in Figure 7. According to the
absorption cross-section spectra of H2S, OCS, CS2, and S2, the absorption peak around 260 nm was attributed
to S2 and the one around 330 nm was attributed to CS2. Therefore, with a proper fitting process, the measurement
of SO2 in the reductive environments with a known temperature
are achievable. However, the accurate absorption cross section of
H2S, OCS, CS2, and S2 at high temperature
are needed to give a more precise analysis.

SO2 having a constant number
density in the environments provided by the flames with different
equivalence ratios, including the fuel-lean case, T2O2 (T = 1750 K, ϕ = 0.74), and fuel-rich case, T2O7 (T = 1750 K, ϕ = 1.32).

Laser-Induced Fluorescence of SO2 Excited by 266
nm Laser
The LIF of SO2 excited by the 266 nm
laser was applied in the concentration measurement of SO2 in combustion atmospheres. First, the spectrum of the LIF emission
of SO2 in the hot flue gas were recorded by a spectrometer.
In the measurement, the number density of SO2 in the premixed
unburnt gas was kept constant, and the hot flue gas had different
temperatures, which was provided by different flames with varying
equivalence ratios. The spectra are presented in Figure 8. All the spectra have a similar
structure, except for the case obtained at room temperature. The fluorescence
could be released from the excited states, C̃ (1B2), B̃ (1B1), and Ã (1A2), after the transition from the X̃(1A1) state with the excitation of the 266 nm laser
beam. At room temperature, excited at 266 nm, there is no absorption
contributed from the C̃ (1B2) ←X̃(1A1) band as shown in Figure 4. Hence, SO2 molecules were mostly
excited to the hybrid energy states, B̃ (1B1) and Ã (1A2).17 The broad band emission in the room temperature case in Figure 8 originated from
the relaxation of SO2 molecules to the ground state during
the second time population process.17 Moreover,
the distinct vibrational structure with a line spacing of about 1050
cm–1 was observed with the relaxation of SO2 molecules from the excited state after the second time population
process. It has been investigated by Sick18 that the spacing was almost 2 times that of the vibrational frequency,
that is, 517 cm–1 of the asymmetrical stretching
mode of the X̃ (1A1) state, which was
caused by the selection rule (Δυ = ±2, ±4, etc.)
of an asymmetric vibration.18,26 At elevated temperature,
the absorption cross section at 266 nm had a significant increase
because of the contribution from the C̃ (1B2) ← X̃ (1A1) transition. Hot SO2 molecules were partially excited to the C̃ (1B2) state by the 266 nm photons and the red-shifted fluorescence
was emitted. Considering that the fluorescence from the B̃ (1B1) state and the Ã (1A2) state was weak,14 the fluorescence from
the C̃ (1B2) state dominated the signal
at high temperature as shown in Figure 8. A stronger emission was obtained from SO2 at a higher temperature. For the fluorescence, a vibrational structure
with a line spacing of about 500 cm–1 was observed.

Figure 8 Spectra
of the fluorescence emission of SO2 excited
by a 266 nm laser at different temperatures (a) and equivalence ratios
(b).

SO2 LIF measurements
at different equivalence ratios
were performed and the results shown in Figure 8b indicate that the stoichiometric ratio
has an influence on the LIF signal. It is mainly caused by the conversion
of SO2 into other sulfur compounds, such as H2S and S2, in reduction environments.23 However, in a comparison of the shapes of the fluorescence
spectra from oxidative and reductive environments, there is no difference
in the structure, which shows that there is no fluorescence emission
originating from other sulfur compounds with the excitation of 266
nm laser.

For the spatially resolved imaging, an ICCD camera
was employed
to collect the fluorescence emission. A long pass filter, WG305, was
used to suppress the scattering from the 266 nm laser. Figure 9a,b shows the intensity of
the fluorescence signal as the function of the laser fluence and SO2 concentration, respectively, in hot flue gas provided by
the flame T2O2 (T = 1750 K, ϕ = 0.74). Good
linear correlations were obtained. In Figure 9b, the relative standard deviation was found
to be almost constant, around 1.3%. The absolute uncertainty was about
1.5 ppm for 100 ppm SO2, while it was about 10 ppm using
UV absorption spectroscopy. Moreover, with seeding 100 ppm SO2, the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of the obtained fluorescence
image was estimated to be around 100 (the obtained noise level was
based on standard deviation of the background without signal), indicating
that the detection limit of the LIF could be around several ppm. The
LIF technique had a higher sensitivity in the measurement of SO2 compared to the UV absorption spectroscopy technique.

Figure 9 Intensity of
the fluorescence emission signal of SO2 as the function
of the laser fluence (a), SO2 concentration
(b), and temperature (c).

On the basis of the linear relationship shown in Figure 9a, the SO2 concentration
could be easily evaluated through the obtained fluorescence emission
signal. However, as illustrated in Figure 9c, besides the SO2 concentration,
the temperature could also influence the fluorescence emission signal.
Measurements were conducted in the hot gas environments at temperatures
from 1120 to 1950 K provided by flames T1O2–T6O2 with a constant
number density of SO2. An enhanced signal was obtained
at a higher temperature, which corresponded to the increasing trend
of the UV absorption cross section with the elevated temperature at
250 nm as shown in Figure 5. Different absorption at 266 nm affected the intensity of
the fluorescence emission. The relationship between the emission intensity
and the temperature was fitted by a parabolic equation (see Figure 9c).

With the
calibration equations obtained in Figure 9b,c, the concentration of SO2 in
the combustion environments was measured using the LIF method with
a known temperature. In the present study, a constant amount of SO2 was introduced into the flames having different equivalence
ratios, from fuel-lean to fuel-rich conditions. Then the concentration
of SO2 in the hot flue gas was obtained on the basis of
its LIF signal. The results are presented in Figure 10. A constant concentration of SO2 around 1500 ppm was obtained in the lean cases. For the cases with
fuel-rich flames, the concentration of SO2 was decreased,
especially for the cases at the temperature of around 1800 K. The
concentration reached around 1200 ppm as the equivalence ratio was
over 1.2, which indicated that around 20% of SO2 was converted
to other sulfur species, which is close to the one we obtained through
UV absorption spectroscopy. Compared to UV absorption spectroscopy,
the LIF technique provided the concentration distribution of SO2. It is more sensitive to the change in SO2 concentration.
However, to have quantitative results, calibration between the fluorescence
signal and the SO2 concentration and temperature was required.
The uncertainty in both the temperature and laser power distribution
might introduce errors into the final results.

Conclusion
Broad band UV absorption spectroscopy and laser-induced
fluorescence
have been used for quantitative measurement of SO2 in combustion
environments. The UV absorption cross sections of SO2 at
temperatures ranging 1120–1950 K were obtained for the first
time. It varied significantly with temperature as the wavelength was
below 260 nm; however, around 277.8 nm, it almost remained constant
at 0.68 × 10–18 cm2/molecule, which
can be used in the measurement of SO2 concentration in
combustion atmospheres with different temperatures. With use of the
UV absorption spectroscopy setup, the measured results had a standard
deviation of around 10 ppm. Moreover, the laser-induced fluorescence
technique was adopted for the SO2 measurement with a 266
nm laser. It is very sensitive in the SO2 detection with
a relative standard deviation of around 1.2%, that is, 2 ppm for the
measurement of 100 ppm SO2, which was more precise than
the UV absorption spectroscopy. The disadvantage of this method is
the requisite of calibration for a quantitative measurement. Consequently,
it would be a good choice to combine the merits of the two methods
for achieving highly sensitive and spatially resolved quantitative
measurements of SO2 in the combustion atmosphere.
