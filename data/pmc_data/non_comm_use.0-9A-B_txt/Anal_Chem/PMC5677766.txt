In
this work we present the application of 3D-printing for the
miniaturization and functionalization of an ion source for (portable)
mass spectrometry (MS). Two versions of a 3D-printed cartridge for
paper spray ionization (PSI) are demonstrated, assessed, and compared.
We first focus on the use of 3D-printing to enable the integration
of an embedded electrostatic lens and a manifold for internal sheath
gas distribution and delivery. Cartridges with and without a sheath
gas manifold and an electrostatic lens are compared with respect to
analytical performance and operational flexibility. The sensitivity
and limit of detection are improved in the cartridge with an electrostatic
lens and sheath gas manifold compared to the cartridge without (15%
and over 6.5× smaller, respectively). The use of these focusing
elements also improved the average spray stability. Furthermore, the
range of potentials required for PSI was lower, and the distance to
the MS orifice over which spray could be obtained was larger. Importantly,
both setups allowed quantification of a model drug in the ng/mL range
with single-stage MS, after correction for spray instability. Finally,
we believe that this work is an example of the impact that 3D-printing
will have on the future of analytical device fabrication, miniaturization,
and functionalization.

==== Body
In the world
of engineering
technology, 3D-printing is a “rising star”. This collection
of fabrication techniques has made a huge impact on the consumer market,
where we are seeing a shift from buying e.g. gadgets, trinkets, and
functional objects to printing them yourself. The concept of rapid prototyping has also been completely reinvented with
this development, making a strong impact in many scientific fields,
with the potential to revolutionize the way we do research. In the
field of microfluidics, we also see these trends;1−6 3D-printing is now being used for many purposes, importantly to
fabricate analytical devices, and to customize lab equipment or setups.
Still, there is a lot of room left to increase the level of ingenuity
and complexity of 3D-printed devices for chemical analysis. Device
geometries are often still relatively simple and could, in many cases,
be achieved via other fabrication methods (at least, if the costs
associated with device prototyping and fabrication could be neglected).

In 2014, we published a functionalized 3D-printed cartridge for
an ambient ionization technique called paper spray ionization (PSI).7 PSI is becoming more popular due to its simplicity
and low cost. Many reports have described the use of PSI for the quantification
of, for example, drugs of abuse,8 pharmaceuticals
in blood,9,10 and toxicants and pollutants in foodstuffs.11 It is striking that many, if not all, of these
methods have two things in common: (i) no use of desolvation gases,
but rather a heated capillary inlet for the liberation of gas-phase
ions, and (ii) the use of tandem MS for quantification (we found one
exception, but the analyses were in the mM-range12). This may be explained by the fact that the use of PSI
is still mostly in the development phase, and therefore standardized
sources are not yet widespread, even though they are commercially
available.8 Customized PSI interfaces to
the MS are still the rule, and paper tips are often positioned with
a metal clip, without the possibility of using sheath gas or the integration
of additional functionality in the source. The use of desolvation
gases is beneficial in instruments without heated-capillary inlets,
but from an engineering point-of-view more difficult to achieve reproducibly.
Furthermore, due to the nature of the paper substrate (i.e., a porous
network of cellulose fibers) and the production method of the tips
(i.e., manual cutting), reproducible paper tips, and thus reproducible
and stable spray, are often difficult to obtain. Finally, spray is
typically only obtained for a minute or so, due to solvent depletion.13 For these reasons, people are relying on the
fragmentation of analytes (tandem MS) and internal standards to perform
quantitative analysis.14

With the
establishment of the PSI approach, further functionalization
of the paper tips has attracted increased attention. Early examples
focused on the on-paper chemical derivatization of compounds to increase
ionization efficiency13 or the use of alternative
substrates to improve analytical performance15,16 (generally by employing substrates with different porosities or
surface energy). More recently, “high” throughput PSI
has been demonstrated17 as well as the
integration of simple paper microfluidic structures on paper tips
to improve the method performance.12,18,19 However, many of these examples are not user-friendly,
and the success of the functionalization is limited by the nature
of the PSI method itself.

Cartridge-based PSI can be employed
to improve user-friendliness
and allow easier integration of functionality. Recent achievements
include the implementation of better solvent control7 and solid phase extraction.20 In this work, we expand the capabilities and level of integration
of a PSI cartridge, in such a way that is not feasible with traditional
(micro)fabrication techniques. Two novel versions of a 3D-printed
cartridge for PSI were designed, fabricated, and tested. The first
represents an upgraded version of a cartridge design we reported in
2014 and integrates features for fast wetting and continuous solvent
supply to the paper tip.7 The second version
incorporates several additional features to enhance performance, including
an electrostatic lens, and pneumatic ducts and nozzles for sheath
gas delivery. In both versions, desolvation gases (either as curtain
gas or as sheath gas) are employed to improve signal, and quantitative
analysis in single-MS mode is demonstrated. While improving and/or
expanding the possibilities and applicability of PSI is definitely
an objective of this work, the main impact and innovation lie in the
design and realization of the two upgraded 3D-printed cartridge designs.
The cartridges exhibit a high level of integration, which would not
have been possible without additive manufacturing.

Materials and
Methods
Chemicals and Disposables
Polylactic acid (PLA, Easyfil,
Formfutura, Nijmegen, The Netherlands) was the material of choice
in the fused-deposition-modeling (FDM) 3D-printing process. Grade-1
chromatography paper (Whatman, Maidstone, England) was used to make
the paper tips. Methanol (Biosolve B.V., Valkenswaard, The Netherlands)
with 1% formic acid (v/v) (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) and
a few drops of blue food dye (mix of E133 and E122) was used as the
spray solvent for the characterization of the spray focusing effect
of the electrostatic lens. Prilocaine (MW. 220, 20 μM in water)
was used as a model compound for optimization experiments. Different
concentrations of lidocaine (MW. 234; 0.05–10 μM in water)
were used in quantification experiments, with prilocaine (20 μM)
as an internal standard (see Supporting Information (SI), Figure S1 for structural formulas). In every
PSI-MS experiment, a sample volume of 5 μL was spotted onto
the front of the tip and dried before analysis. 480 μL of methanol
with 1% formic acid (v/v) was used as eluent and spray solvent in
PSI-MS experiments.

Cartridge Designs
Two different
cartridges were produced
and tested for a number of characteristics. The first cartridge was
an improved version of the fast wetting and continuous solvent supply
(FWACSS) PSI cartridge that was published in 2014.7 The improvements were as follows (see Figure 1A–B, and SI, Figure S2). Two lateral wicks (one on each side
of the central wick) instead of just one wick served to provide continuous
wetting. The three wicks lead to a symmetrical flow profile and increased
supply of solvent during the experiment (which is particularly important
for solvents with a high contribution of volatile, organic solvent
such as methanol). Second, a platform, on which the base of the paper
tip could rest, served as a solvent guide structure, as well as a
secondary reservoir for excess solvent from the fast initial wetting.
Toward the front of the cartridge, the tip was suspended in air, allowing
slower migration of solvent through the paper and thus a controlled
elution of sample to the front of the tip. Third, the contact between
the front of the tip and the cartridge was minimized, to prevent unwanted
solvent and sample retention in undesirable locations around the tip.
This cartridge model is henceforth referred to as a controlled and
symmetric elution (CASE) PSI cartridge. Furthermore, a 3D-printed
holder for the cartridge was developed, which could be directly mounted
onto the front of the mass spectrometer, to increase the reproducibility
of cartridge positioning (see SI, Figure S2). This cartridge was tested with curtain gas (i.e., gas flow in
the direction opposite to the direction of the spray) from the mass
spectrometer (Figure 1C).

elution (CASE). (D–F) PSI cartridge with electrostatic lens
and nozzles for sheath gas delivery (LAN). The figure shows (A, D)

and (C, F) schematic top views of the experimental configurations
for PSI. Yellow arrows in D show the distribution of air through the
network of ducts, bifurcations and nozzles; the inset in D shows a
cross-sectional front view along the length of the gas tubes.

The second cartridge was tested
with two more implemented features
(Figure 1D–E).
Four nozzles were included around the spray tip for the continuous
delivery of sheath gas, supplied to the cartridge sheath gas manifold
via a single inlet at the rear of the cartridge. Additionally, an
electrostatic lens was included as a focusing element immediately
in front of the paper tip. This cartridge model is henceforth referred
to as the lens and nozzles (LAN) PSI cartridge. The
same 3D-printed holder affixed to the MS was used for positioning
as was employed for the CASE PSI cartridge. However, sheath gas was
used instead of curtain gas for the operation of the LAN cartridge
(Figure 1F).

Fabrication
The 3D drawing and fabrication of PSI cartridges
is described in detail in previous work.7 In short, designs were made in Solidworks (Waltham, MA, USA) and
exported in *STL format. This file was sliced (Skeinforge/SFact),
and then the part was printed on a Felix v. 3 FDM 3D printer (Felix,
de Meern, The Netherlands), run by Repertier Host freeware.

The electrostatic lens was made by bending a nickel-plated paperclip
(d = 0.8 mm) around a metal rod (d = 1.5 mm) and subsequently cutting the thus-formed spiral into circles.
Each circle was closed with solder, and three wire arms were attached
to the circle for positioning it in the front end of the 3D-printed
cartridge and for connection to a power supply (see Figure 1E). The lens was inserted by
pausing the 3D printer at a specific point during the print job, in
which a predesigned cavity for the lens had been formed. After placement
of the lens, the print was resumed and the cavity for the lens was
sealed from above, thus confining the lens to the cartridge.

The inlet for sheath gas was designed with an inner diameter of
1.5 mm and an outer diameter of 3 mm. The inner diameter of the manifold
(with curves and bifurcations) varied roughly between 1.4 and 1.6
mm. In order to test for leakages in the air ducts, air was guided
through the cartridge while submerging it in a water bath. If present,
leaks were identified and sealed by applying two-component epoxy glue
to the exterior of the ducts.

Paper tips were cut using a 3D-printed
stencil and a surgical scalpel.
The front part of the tips were cut at an angle of 60° (see Figure 1C and 1F) using a pressing rather than a slicing motion of the blade,
to prevent cellulose fibers from being pulled apart. The tips were
inspected under the microscope, and frayed ends were removed with
a scalpel. Furthermore, the two corners at the front of the tip were
rounded off to prevent spray and discharge between those corners and
the electrostatic lens.

Characterization of Air Distribution over
Four Nozzles (LAN
PSI Cartridge)
The path lengths and diameters along the four
different conduits were designed to be identical for sheath gas flow
in the desolvation network. In order to quantify the actual distribution
of air after fabrication through the bifurcations and ducts of the
3D-printed network, an adapted version of the LAN PSI cartridge was
designed and printed with extended nozzles, so that flexible tubes
could be attached (see Figure 2A). Four lengths of tubing were cut to the same length and
these were attached to the cartridge. Four bottles with volumetric
markings were filled completely with water and submerged into a water
bath, top-down (see Figure 2B). Each of the four tubes extending from a nozzle was placed
under the opening of a bottle. Next, the air inlet of the cartridge
was connected to an air source (0.2 bar) and air flow was applied
(see SI, Video S1). After approximately
30 s, the gas flow was stopped and a mark was made on each bottle
at the level of the water–air interface inside the bottle (Figure 2C). The volume in
each bottle occupied by air was related to the average volume of air
in the four bottles in that run, yielding a relative distribution.
This was repeated two more times with the same cartridge (n = 3), and an average percentage per nozzle was calculated.
The standard deviation of the four nozzles was calculated to determine
the distribution of air from a single inlet over the four nozzles.

inlet through three bifurcations and finally four exit nozzles. (A)
The LAN PSI cartridge was adapted and equipped with extended nozzles
for the attachment of tubing. (B) Each piece of tubing was placed
beneath the opening to a water-filled bottle, which was positioned
up-side-down in a water bath. Upon application of air (0.2 bar), the
water was forced out of the bottles and replaced by air. (C) After
approximately 30 s, the level of the water–air interface was
marked on the bottle and read to approximate the volume of displaced
water.

Characterization of the
Electrostatic Lens (LAN PSI Cartridge)
The effect of the
electrostatic lens was visualized by introducing
spray solvent with blue dye added to a LAN PSI cartridge, which was
then positioned in front of a metal plate at ground potential. Different
potentials (200–700 V, n = 3 per potential)
were applied to the lens while the paper tip was kept at the same
potential (2.3 kV) and spray was generated for approximately 2 min
per condition. After 2 min, the lens potential was altered and the
cartridge was shifted a few millimeters along the plate. The spots
were then photographed with a ruler for size reference. ImageJ21 was used to measure the height and width of
the spots, which were used to approximate the area.

PSI Setup
PSI-MS experiments were performed on a Sciex
API 2000. When coupled to a standard electrospray ion source, desolvation
is ensured by the use of elevated temperature and both sheath and
curtain gas. In our experiments, elevated temperatures were not used,
as that would damage the 3D-printed plastics. For the CASE PSI cartridge,
curtain gas was applied via the MS. A flow regulator was built between
the nitrogen source and the MS inlet. A flow rate of 0.3 L/min was
used, as higher flow rates generally impaired paper spray, whereas
lower flow rates led to lower signal (probably because of less desolvation).
For the LAN PSI cartridge, the nitrogen tubing was detached from the
MS and attached to the cartridge’s sheath gas network. The
opening for curtain gas in the MS inlet was sealed with a cap. Sheath
gas flow rates between 0.7 and 1.5 L/min were applied. In both setups,
the curtain plate was grounded. PSI cartridges were positioned reproducibly
with a specifically designed 3D-printed holder that could be clicked
onto the MS (see SI, Figure S2).

Data Processing
and Analysis
Data from all PSI-MS experiments
were recorded with Analyst software in the m/z range of 50–500 (1 s acquisition time for the entire
range). The total ion current (TIC) and extracted ion chromatogram
(XIC) traces for m/z 221 and 235
(signals for protonated prilocaine and lidocaine, respectively) were
exported as text files. These files were imported into Microsoft Excel,
which was used for simple data processing. The ratios for 221/TIC
and 235/221 were calculated and plotted over time. Since the concentration
of prilocaine (221) was kept constant in all experiments, the 221/TIC
ratio was used as a measure for spectral complexity. This allows the
quantification of the ratio between informative and noninformative
MS data. The 235/221 ratio was used for quantification of lidocaine
samples. In the 221/TIC plot, a threshold value was selected as a
minimum filter to exclude noninformative data (0.025–0.06 in
CASE cartridges (average of 0.041); 0.04–0.15 in LAN cartridges
(average of 0.091) in quantification experiments (see SI, Tables S1, S2). The first 50 of the remaining
data points were subsequently used to (i) determine 221/TIC, (ii)
quantify lidocaine (m/z 235/221),
and (iii) assess spray quality. The latter was done by calculating
(a) the time it took to acquire those 50 data points (shorter acquisition
times mean more informative data, thus better signal stability) and
(ii) the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the 50 data points on
the prilocaine trace (XIC of m/z 221), which was used for this purpose because it was the internal
standard in our experiments. The (a) acquisition times and (b) RSD
values of the absolute signal on the 221 trace for each experiment
were combined into a data set (either CASE or LAN). Both data sets
have their own mean and SD. A two-tailed t test was
used to assess whether the data sets were significantly different.

Setup Optimization
For both configurations (CASE and
LAN), the distance between the tip and the curtain plate was varied
(x = 1.8, 2.8, 3.8, or 4.8 mm; see Figure 1C and 1F) and aqueous samples containing only prilocaine (20 μM) were
analyzed to determine the 221/TIC (n = 3 or higher).
Curtain gas and sheath gas flow rates were set at 0.3 and 0.9 L/min,
respectively, for these analyses.

In the next set of experiments,
the flow rate of the sheath gas in the LAN PSI cartridge was varied
during the elution of prilocaine. Since the compound is spotted on
paper and eluted during the experiment, the concentration (and thus
the 221/TIC) changes over time. When a stable spray had been obtained
at a nitrogen sheath flow rate of 0.9 L/min, the experiment was started.
After approximately 15 s, the sheath gas flow rate was changed to
a different value. Approximately 15 s later, it was changed back to
0.9 L/min. This procedure was repeated for each of the tested sheath
flow rates. The 221/TIC values for tested sheath flow rates were normalized
with respect to values of 221/TIC obtained at 0.9 L/min, recorded
just before and after each test point.

The lens potential was
fixed at 500 V, which is in between the
potential of the paper (>1.5 kV) and the curtain plate (ground).

Quantitative Analysis with Single-Stage MS
Calibration
lines were measured for the analysis of lidocaine with both the CASE
PSI cartridge (x = 1.8 mm, curtain gas flow rate
= 0.3 L/min) and the LAN PSI cartridge (x = 3.8 mm,
sheath gas flow rate = 0.9 L/min, lens potential = 500 V), after the
above-mentioned data processing step. Sensitivity was calculated as
the slope of the calibration lines. The limit of detection (LOD) and
quantification (LOQ) were obtained by multiplying the SD of five blank
samples (containing only prilocaine) with 3 and 10, respectively,
and dividing them by the sensitivity.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of Air Distribution over Four Nozzles (LAN
PSI Cartridge)
Airflow was obtained from all four nozzles
when air was applied to the single inlet of the sheath gas manifold
(see SI, Video S1). The experiment was
performed in triplicate, and an RSD of 11% was obtained for flows
through the different nozzles (see SI, Figure S3). In the experiment, we reproducibly found the same flow
ratios when comparing the different nozzles (i.e., one nozzle consistently
emitted the highest gas flow, and another consistently emitted the
lowest). The deviation from a completely equal distribution over all
four nozzles can be attributed to different flow resistances of the
respective gas ducts, which in turn are caused by minor differences
in the actual diameter of the ducts. We can account for this difference
by recalling that we are pushing the limit of the 3D printer resolution
at this small scale, which is in the order of a few hundred micrometers.
The use of a 3D-printing approach with a higher resolution should
lead to a more equal distribution. Nevertheless, the distribution
is still acceptable, and the (spatial) control over gas flows is likely
greater than would be the case in a configuration in which desolvation
gases would have had to be applied via fixed, external tubes in a
cartridge-less setup. Furthermore, the network for gas delivery does
not consist of simple straight tubes, but of curved, bifurcating,
ascending and descending ducts (see Figure 1D, yellow arrows).

Characterization of the
Electrostatic Lens (LAN PSI Cartridge)
A spray visualization
experiment was performed, in which spray
solvent with a blue dye was sprayed against a metal plate through
the electrostatic lens. Different lens potentials were tested with
respect to a fixed potential applied to the paper tip. This led to
the formation of differently sized blue spots on the grounded plate
(see Figure 3A). The
width and height of these spots were measured and plotted as a function
of the applied potentials (see SI, Figure S4). Next, the spot area was calculated and also plotted as a function
of the applied potentials (see Figure 3B). In all cases, we see a clear correlation between
the dimensions and the applied potential. The lens can therefore be
used to focus the ion spray, since the spray spots become smaller
with an increase in lens potential. However, increasing the lens potential
with respect to a fixed potential applied to the paper tip effectively
decreases the electric field strength available for PSI. Since a sufficiently
strong electric field is required to generate paper spray, a maximum
lens potential was encountered above which spray could no longer be
generated (600–700 V).

a LAN PSI cartridge.

of 200–600 V (in triplicate) were applied to the lens, while
the potential between the tip and the metal plate was kept fixed (2.3
kV). (B) Relationship between applied lens potential and cross-sectional
area of paper spray, which decreases at a higher lens potential. Error
bars show the standard deviation.

Data Processing
In order to do quantitative analysis
with single-stage PSI-MS, it is necessary to perform some data treatment
prior to analysis. Data from most spray experiments contain both periods
during which good spray signal was obtained (informative data), as
well as periods during which no signal or signal from poor spray was
recorded (noninformative data). This is due to the fact that PSI is
often not stable, which can lead to strong fluctuations in signal
amplitudes, as well as very noisy spectra. In turn, this means that
we need to find a way to distinguish between informative and noninformative
spectra. Figure S5 (SI) shows an example
of a spray experiment in which we clearly see both types of data.
It also shows how the inclusion of such data might lead to incorrect
results, and how applying a filter based on the 221/TIC prior to data
analysis resolved the issue.

Another approach for quantification
using an internal standard would involve taking the ratio between
the areas under the curve for the traces of lidocaine (sample) and
prilocaine (internal standard). Even in an unfiltered set of data,
the contribution from noninformative data would only be minor, because
the individual signals are added before the ratio is taken and these
signals are negligible compared to signal from informative spectra.
However, with the approach delineated in Figure S5 in the SI, there is better control over the quality of the
data that are used. By filtering the data based on the 221/TIC, noninformative
data points are discarded and data analysis begins when actual analyte
signals have been observed.

Positioning of the Cartridge in Both Configurations
Table 1 shows the
obtained 221/TIC values for both cartridge configurations (CASE and
LAN) at different distances from the curtain plate, as well as the
range of potentials that had to be applied in order to obtain paper
spray. If we compare both cartridges at the same distance from the
MS (x = 2.8 mm), Table 1 shows that use of the LAN PSI cartridge
results in a cleaner (3.1 times higher 221/TIC, p < 0.05, two-tailed t test, paired variance)
signal than the CASE model and requires a lower spray potential (up
to 2 kV). In this comparison, the cleaner signal resulted mainly from
a significant decrease in total ion signal, whereas the absolute analyte
signal remained of similar magnitude. The difference in required potentials
between the two configurations is probably based on the distribution
of the electrical field. In the CASE PSI cartridge, the electrical
field at the tip decreases with an increased distance between the
tip and curtain plate (increased “x” in Figure 1C). Therefore, increasingly
high potentials are required to produce spray, up to the point where
spray can no longer be obtained (starting above 2.8 mm) with potentials
up to 5 kV. In the LAN model, the distance between the lens and the
paper tip is constant, regardless of the position of the cartridge;
thus, the electrical field at the tip is less influenced by the distance
between the tip and curtain plate (“x” in Figure 1F). This results in a situation
where spray could still be obtained at a distance of 4.8 mm from the
curtain plate and a potential range which appears to be unaffected
by the value of “x”. Greater distances were not tested,
due to the fact that the 221/TIC ratio decreased as the distance to
the curtain plate increased.

Position of the Cartridge

2.8	3	0.17 ± 0.014	1.5–2.2	
a Used as the ratio between informative
and noninformative data.

An increase of the 221/TIC with a shorter distance to the orifice
is observed for both configurations, probably due to the fact that
the diameter of the cross-section of the spray increases as it travels
to the MS inlet. Therefore, analyte becomes more spread out, as a
longer distance to the MS is chosen. A drawback of positioning either
cartridge close to the MS orifice is the decreased control of positioning
in the other two dimensions. The reason for this is simple, namely
that the cartridge is so close to the curtain plate that we can no
longer see where the paper tip and the center of the lens are “pointing”.

Influence of Sheath Gas Flow Rate on 221/TIC in the LAN Configuration
Figure 4 demonstrates
how the sheath gas flow rate influences the PSI signal. The prilocaine
and total ion trace are plotted over time for an experiment in which
sheath gas flow rates were alternated between 0.9 L/min and other
values (Figure 4A).
Black arrows indicate when the flow rate was changed to a different
value for 15 s, after which it was changed back to 0.9 L/min for 15
s (indicated by a smaller, light-blue arrow). The average 221/TIC
for all of those 15-s windows are plotted over time (Figure 4B). The blue line in 4B, which
connects all the windows taken at 0.9 L/min, shows the elution profile
of prilocaine from the paper tip. Furthermore, it shows that the 221/TIC
values for all other flow rates (red diamonds) lie below this line.
In Figure 4C, the values
for all the different sheath gas flow rates in Figure 4B are normalized with respect to the blue
line (i.e., the interpolated elution profile of prilocaine at 0.9
L/min). This was done by taking the ratio between the value of interest
(red diamonds) and the average of the two neighboring values on the
0.9 L/min curve (blue diamonds). Figure 4C visualizes the relation between sheath
gas flow rate and 221/TIC for the entire flow rate range.

to the 221/TIC found at 0.9 L/min directly before and after the flow
rate measurement in question) versus the sheath gas flow rate. During
the experiment, the flow rate was switched from and back to 0.9 L/min.
Labeled black arrows indicate at which times the flow rate was changed
and into which value. Light-blue arrows indicate when the sheath gas
flow rate was changed back to 0.9 L/min.

Sheath gas may affect ion intensity in two respects. First
of all,
desolvation is facilitated by convective air movement. Higher flow
rates would lead to more evaporation and thus faster and more efficient
formation of gas-phase ions. Moreover, as the nozzles are designed
with an inward angle, the nitrogen will aid in focusing the spray.
At lower flow rates, this effect could be beneficial, yet at higher
flow rates, adverse effects due to turbulance may occur, which could
impair stable spray. Furthermore, excessive focusing could also lead
to an increase in unwanted signal (such as that stemming from solvent
molecules).

There is an optimum in the sheath gas flow rate
range at 0.9 L/min.
At lower flow rates, we see a higher total signal, while the analyte
signal decreases. This probably means that the desolvation is less
efficient (less prilocaine is liberated, higher solvent signals are
observed). At higher flow rates, the 221/TIC also drops, but this
is caused mainly by an increase in total signal, whereas the contribution
of changes in the prilocaine signal are low. Most likely, there is
sufficient desolvation, but additional focusing of the ion cloud occurs,
leading to a higher total signal. If we are not applying sheath gas,
or at a very low flow rate, it becomes difficult to obtain spray in
this configuration.

Finally, it is important to note that the
experiments in this work
were all performed with methanol as spray solvent, which evaporates
relatively easily, compared to water. Therefore, the choice of a sheath
gas flow rate should be optimized for different compositions of the
spray solvent.

Quantification of Lidocaine with Single-Stage
MS (CASE and LAN
PSI Cartridges)
Figure 5 shows the calibration lines for lidocaine in water
for both setups, with concentrations up to 5 μM. The performance
of both methods is also summarized in Table 2. An overview of the individual experiments,
with values listed for important parameters (including 221/TIC, 235/221,
and thresholds for data filtration), can be found in Tables S1 and S2 in the SI, for the CASE model and the LAN
model, respectively. These combined results demonstrate that the LAN
PSI cartridge gives a higher sensitivity (15% increase) than the CASE
model, and the LOD and LOQ for the LAN model are also improved (>6.5
times lower). Along with the lower required potentials for spray generation,
and increased flexibility of cartridge positioning, these numbers
show that the LAN PSI cartridge has enhanced performance compared
to the CASE model. On a more general note, these results show that
quantitative analysis is feasible with both cartridges, even without
resorting to tandem MS, at least for this particular analysis. More
research is needed to allow more general statements about the quantitative
performance and applicability in different contexts, but that is beyond
the scope of this work.

Signal Quality
Table 2 also shows that the LAN PSI
cartridge appears to give
a better spray stability than the CASE model, likely due to the directional
focusing of ions by both the electrostatic lens and the sheath gas.
Experiments with the LAN PSI cartridge showed significantly smaller
signal fluctuations (based on the mean of RSDs of the absolute signal
in the prilocaine trace after filtration, n = 20)
compared to the CASE model (>3 times lower, p ≪
0.05 (two-tailed t test, unpaired variance)), but
there was no significant difference found in the time it took to generate
50 spectra of sufficient quality (p = 0.176 (two-tailed t test, paired variance)). There is still some variation
in the quality of the experiments with the LAN PSI cartridge, which
occasionally resulted in poor spray and thus in differences in the
quality of the experiments. This may be attributed to the fact that
the lens was handmade, and the paper tips are still manually cut and
positioned in the cartridge. If the tip is not completely symmetrical,
misaligned in the cartridge, or some cellulose fibers are sticking
out, stable spray may be impaired. Furthermore, the experiments with
the CASE PSI cartridge generally required continuous tuning of the
potential to obtain proper signal, often over a range of approximately
1 kV, whereas the LAN configuration commonly required only a single,
fixed potential.

Conclusion
The concept of 3D-printing
gas ducts and nozzles opens new design
possibilities for customized experimental setups, as it can be employed
for techniques other than PSI. Normally, the generic ion source of
an MS is removed when an experimental setup is created to develop
a new ion source technology, which limits the possibilities of even
using sheath gas. With 3D-printing, a preferred duct and nozzle angle
can be realized more quickly, releasing the gas at the optimal location.
Furthermore, we have shown that 3D-printing allows the integration
of non-3D-printed objects into a single part (e.g., an electrostatic
lens). This is also an attractive feature of employing 3D-printing
for the fabrication of miniaturized instrumentation.

Cartridge-based
PSI was employed for quantitative analysis using
only single-stage mass spectrometry, which could be used to detect
and quantify an aqueous solution of lidocaine in the ng/mL range,
after facile data processing. Obviously, whether single MS suffices
is highly application-specific and, for the analysis of very complex
samples, the use of tandem MS would in all likelihood still be necessary.
Further and more detailed assessment of the quantitative performance
of the PSI cartridges should therefore be performed in a case-by-case
fashion. We have also developed a cartridge for PSI into which a sheath
gas function and an electric lens have been integrated (LAN configuration).
The performance (3× cleaner signal, 15% sensitivity increase,
>6.5× lower LOD) and signal stability (>3 times lower RSD
on m/z 221 traces) were improved
when compared
with the cartridge without these functions (CASE configuration). Furthermore,
spray could be generated at lower potentials and over larger distances
with these additions, giving the user more flexibility. These developments
may also benefit the field of miniaturized mass spectrometry, in which
a fully portable MS is the goal.

In order to further increase
the reproducibility of paper spray
measurements, the process of cartridge and lens fabrication, as well
as cutting and positioning of the paper tip, should be automated.
Currently, the main cause for inferior measurements seems to be the
imprecision associated with the manual fabrication process (differential
cutting, misalignment of the tip, imperfections in the lens).

Significant PSI cartridge optimization was carried out, but a number
of parameters could still be explored to produce a further enhanced
PSI signal. First of all, only a single configuration for the nozzles
was tested. Different angles to the axis of the spray and different
positions in relation to the front of the paper tip might lead to
better focusing and desolvation of analyte ions. Second, additional
ion optics might be integrated in order to better guide ions toward
the orifice of the MS. Finally, the size and shape of the paper tip
is an important parameter for the quality of the spray, as has been
demonstrated in other studies,22 and we
believe that there is still room for improvement in this field. However,
we have shown that mastering the incorporation of signal enhancing
features such as sheath gas and an electric lens into the PSI cartridge
can compensate in part for imperfections in the paper tip.
