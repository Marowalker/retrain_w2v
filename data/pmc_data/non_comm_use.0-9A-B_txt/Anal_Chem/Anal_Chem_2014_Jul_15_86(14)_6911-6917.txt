To
date there is no rapid method to screen for highly pathogenic
avian influenza strains that may be indicators of future pandemics.
We report here the first development of an oligonucleotide-based spectroscopic
assay to rapidly and sensitively detect a N66S mutation in the gene
coding for the PB1-F2 protein associated with increased virulence
in highly pathogenic pandemic influenza viruses. 5′-Thiolated
ssDNA oligonucleotides were employed as probes to capture RNA isolated
from six influenza viruses, three having N66S mutations, two without
the N66S mutation, and one deletion mutant not encoding the PB1-F2
protein. Hybridization was detected without amplification or labeling
using the intrinsic surfaced-enhanced Raman spectrum of the DNA-RNA
complex. Multivariate analysis identified target RNA binding from
noncomplementary sequences with 100% sensitivity, 100% selectivity,
and 100% correct classification in the test data set. These results
establish that optical-based diagnostic methods are able to directly
identify diagnostic indicators of virulence linked to highly pathogenic
pandemic influenza viruses without amplification or labeling.

Influenza
A virus is a ubiquitous
negative strand RNA virus having pandemic potential.1,2 Numerous studies have suggested that specific mutations in the HA,
PB1, and NA genes are related to influenza virulence and pandemic
potential.3−6 The PB1-F2 protein has especially been linked to virulence since
it is considered proapoptotic and pathogenic.7−10 A N66S mutation in the PB1-F2
sequence is consistent among pathogenic influenza viruses, including
the pandemic 1918 H1N1 and 1997 H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza
strains, and is considered a virulence determinant.11 Research shows that the N66S mutation correlates with significantly
increased pathogenicity and mortality in mice and that PB1-F2 promotes
secondary bacterial infections; the mechanism of increased virulence
may be related to inhibition of interferon induction.12 A recent global database analysis of the PB1-F2 protein
revealed that the N66S mutation was present in only 3.8% of the H5N1
strains; however, the mutation was specifically found associated with
the highly pathogenic strains.13 In particular,
all six H5N1 human isolates having the N66S mutation in the PB1-F2
protein isolated from Hong Kong influenza outbreaks were found to
be highly pathogenic.13 Given these data,
it is apparent that the N66S mutation is relevant and critical for
determining the pathogenic potential of influenza.

Development
of a rapid and sensitive method for identifying emerging
influenza viruses and determinants of virulence or pandemic potential
is critical for control of transmission and disease intervention strategies.
Currently, only genomic techniques such as PCR are available for laboratory
diagnosis of virulence markers.14,15 While these techniques
provide identification of prognostic indicators, they rely entirely
on genomic sequencing and alignment and can be limited by issues of
reliability, standardization, and cost. Some studies of a commercial
PCR test for influenza showed a relatively low sensitivity (∼75%);16 the authors suggest the use of a more sensitive
reference test to confirm negative results. The inability to provide
definitive screening highlights the need for a diagnostic platform
with high sensitivity, specificity, and expediency.

Our research
groups have previously shown that surface-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a highly sensitive and specific method
for direct, label-free detection of DNA-RNA binding.17−22 The intrinsic Raman spectra of oligonucleotide probe-target complexes
have been shown to be spectrally unique and sensitive to the hybridization
of both matched and mismatched target sequences.23−29 We recently reported on a SERS-based assay for identification of
virulence factors associated with pathogenesis in influenza in model
systems.30 The current work shows that
oligonucleotide-modified Ag nanorod arrays can be used for rapid and
sensitive detection of pathogenicity determinants isolated from highly
pathogenic and pandemic influenza viruses through direct identification
of RNA and genetic mutations in PB1-F2 without amplification or labeling
of the virus. The findings reported here provide the basis for oligonucleotide-based
SERS screening of influenza with pandemic potential in a point-of-care
application.

Experimental Methods
Reagents
6-Mercapto-1-hexanol
(MCH) was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). All other chemicals were of analytical
grade and used without any further purification. The hybridization
buffer was prepared by dissolving 20 mM Tris HCl, 15 mM NaCl, 4 mM
KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM CaCl2 in molecular
biology grade water at pH 7.3; it was stored at 4 °C when it
is not in use. The buffer and working tools were DNase free.

Preparation
of Ag Nanorod SERS Substrates
Oblique-angle
vapor deposition (OAD) was used to produce aligned Ag nanorod substrates
for SERS applications, according to previously published methods.31,32 In brief, standard glass microscope slides were cleaned using piranha
solution, rinsed several times with deionized water, and dried using
N2 before being placed into a custom-designed, high vacuum
electron beam vapor deposition chamber. Uniform thin film layers of
Ti (20 nm) layer and Ag (500 nm) were first deposited onto the glass
substrate at rates of 2.0 and 3.0 Å/s, respectively. The substrates
were then rotated to 86° relative to the incident vapor source,
and Ag nanorods were deposited at a constant rate of 3.0 Å/s
until a nominal thickness of 2000 nm, as determined by a quartz crystal
microbalance in the deposition chamber. These vapor deposition conditions
result in optimal high aspect ratio Ag nanorod SERS substrates with
overall nanorod lengths of ∼900 nm, diameters of ∼80–90
nm, densities of ∼13 nanorods/μm2, and a tilt
angle of 71° with respect to the substrate normal.32 Following nanofabrication, a patterned multiwell
array was produced on the Ag nanorod substrate according to previously
published procedures.33

DNA Probes
DNA probes were purchased from Integrated
DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA). The 5′-C6 thiolated
ssDNA probes were received lyophilized and dissolved in molecular
biology grade water to a concentration of 1000 nM. DNA probes were
designed for viruses having determinants of low and high virulence
in the PB1-F2 RNA, as previously described.30

Influenza Viruses
Three wild type influenza viruses
were used in in these studies: A/Mute Swan/MS451072/06 (H5N1), A/CK/TX/167280-04/02
(H5N3), and A/CK/PA/13609/93 (H5N2).34 The
first two of these wild type viruses are examples of strains containing
the N66S mutation, while the third did not have the mutation. Three
additional reverse genetics viruses were used in these studies. These
were the WH, WH N66S, and WH ΔPB1-F2 strains. These three viruses
are 7:1 reassortants of A/WSN/33 (H1N1) with the PB1 segment (segment
2) of A/Hong Kong/156/97 (H5N1) highly pathogenic avian influenza
virus. Two of these reverse genetics viruses contained either the
wild type, intact PB1-F2 protein (WH), or the PB1-F2 protein with
the N66S mutation (WH N66S). The third of the reverse genetics viruses
was a negative control in which the PB1-F2 protein was deleted by
removal of the start codon and introduction of two stop codons within
the PB1-F2 open reading frame (WH ΔPB1-F2).11,35

MDCK cells were used to propagate the WH influenza viruses
and were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM;
GIBSO BRL Laboratories, Grand Island, NY) with 5% heat-inactivated
(56 °C) FBS (Hyclone Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT). For virus
production, MDCK cells were rinsed three times with PBS, overlaid
with 5 mL of MEM + TPCK trypsin (1 μg/mL; Worthington Biochemical,
Lakewood, NJ) + virus and grown for 3–5 days at 35 °C
until ∼70% cells were released from the flask surface. Supernatants
containing virus were collected, centrifuged to remove cellular debris,
aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C until use. Virus titers
were quantified by hemagglutination (HA), 50% tissue culture infectious
dose (TCID50), and plaque assays as previously described.36 The virus stock titer and PFU in 0.2 mL final
volume for each of the influenza viruses used in this study are summarized
in Table S.1 in the Supporting Information.

Viral Influenza RNA Samples
Viral RNAs isolated from
six strains of influenza were used. This include three examples of
N66S mutations (WH N66S, A/Mute Swan/MS451072/06, A/CK/TX/167280-04/02),
and two without the N66S mutation (WH, A/CK/PA/13609/93). An influenza
deletion mutant not containing the PB1-F2 sequence was used as a negative
control (WH ΔPB1-F2). A PureLink Viral RNA/DNA mini Kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) was used to isolate influenza virus RNA. Viral RNA was
extracted by mixing 200 μL of each strain with 25 μL of
Proteinase K in 1.5 mL followed by addition of 200 μL of 1×
PBS/0.5% BSA in a microcentrifuge tube. The resulting solution was
mixed for 15 s and then the lysate was incubated at 56 °C for
15 min. Subsequently, 250 μL of 96–100% ethanol was added,
and then the lysate was mixed for 15 s followed by the incubation
for 5 min at room temperature. The lysate was transferred onto the
Viral Spin Column and centrifuged at 5 000 rpm for 1 min. The
flow-through was discarded and the spin column was placed in a new
collection tube. The washing step was repeated one more time with
500 μL of the wash buffer. The collection tube was discarded
and the spin column was transferred into a new collection tube and
spun at 13 000 rpm for 1 min to dry the column. The column
was placed into a new recovery tube, and 50 μL of sterile, RNase-free
water was added to the top of the the column. The resulting solution
was incubated for 1 min at room temperature. The column was then centrifuged
at 13 000 rpm for 1 min to elute the viral nucleic acids. Virus
RNA purity and concentration was quantified by UV–vis spectrometry
(Thermo Fisher NanoDrop 1000, Wilmington, DE).

Immobilization of DNA Probes
onto Ag Nanorod Arrays
5′-Thiol single stranded DNA
(ssDNA) oligonucleotide probes
were immobilized on the Ag nanorod array surface to capture and detect
RNA strains corresponding to the PB1-F2 gene mutation. Preparation
of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of ssDNA probes on the Ag nanorod
substrates followed previously published procedures.20,22,30 Briefly, 20 μL of 1000
nM of the oligonucleotide solution was added to a patterned microwell
and incubated overnight at room temperature. After the incubation,
any unbound oligonucleotide solution was removed from the microwell
by rinsing it three times with molecular biology grade water and blow
dried with N2. Then, 20 μL of 100 nM solution of
the spacer molecule 6-mercapto-1-hexanol (MCH) was added to the microwell
in order to minimize nonspecific binding of DNA/RNA molecules to the
surface of Ag nanorod substrates and for the correct oligonucleotide
conformation. The spacer molecule was incubated for 6 h at room temperature
followed by the rinsing and drying steps. A volume of 20 μL
of 20 ng/μL (∼5 nM) RNA solution diluted in the binding
buffer was added to the oligonucleotide-functionalized Ag nanorod
to accomplish the hybridization and incubated at 37 °C for 2
h under a humid environment to avoid dehydration. After the incubation,
any nonspecifically adsorbed RNA molecules were removed by rinsing
with the binding buffer with the final wash using molecular biology
grade water. The rinsed substrate was then dried with a gentle stream
of N2.

Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectra
were collected using
a confocal Raman microscope (InVia, Renishaw, Inc., Hoffman Estates,
IL) equipped with a 785 nm diode laser as the excitation source. The
sample was illuminated through a 20× (Leica, Germany) N.A. =
0.40 objective with a spot size of approximately 4.8 μm ×
27.8 μm; laser power was ∼0.42 mW as measured at the
sample. Spectra were collected between 2000–500 cm–1 using a 30 s acquisition time. Spectra were acquired from five different
spots in each individual microwell on the Ag nanorod substrate. Four
microwells were used for each sample; therefore, 20 spectra were collected
for each sample and used for further data analysis.

Data Analysis
Prior to multivariate analysis, the raw
spectra were preprocessed using a first order Savitzky–Golay
derivative filter (15-point, second order polynomial), normalized
to unit vector length, and mean centered. These preprocessing methods
removed any spectral variations caused by instrumental drift, nonuniformity
between different microwells on the substrate, and environmental changes.
Initial spectral quality was assessed using principal component analysis
(PCA). Determination of spectral outliers was based on calculation
of their PCA scores with their corresponding Hotelling T2 and Q residuals values.37 Out of more than 140 spectra used in this analysis,
only one spectral outlier was found and eliminated prior to analysis.

Multivariate analysis for classification was performed using partial
least-squares discriminate analysis (PLS-DA)38 and support vector machine discriminate analysis (SVM-DA).39,40 All data processing was performed with PLS Toolbox version 6.2 (Eigenvector
Research Inc., Wenatchee, WA) in MATLAB R2012a (The Mathworks Inc.,
Natick, MA).

Results
Six influenza strains were
used in this study. Three of these influenza
strains contained the N66S mutation, representative of the putative
PB1-F2 mutation consistent with increased virulence; these were the
WH N66S, A/Mute Swan/MS45107206, and A/CK/TX167280-04/02 strains.
Two other viruses were used that did not contain the N66S mutation
and were representative of low virulence; these were the WH and A/CK/PA/13609/93
strains. A negative control virus was included, WH ΔPB1-F2,
that had the open reading frame for the PB1-F2 protein deleted. For
simplicity, viruses containing the N66S determinant are referred to
as “high virulence” while the viruses not containing
the N66S determinant are referred to as “low virulence.”
In addition to these samples, spectra of the DNA probe alone were
collected and used in the analyses.

SERS spectra are shown in
Figure 1A,B for
the high and low virulence strains, respectively; each spectrum is
an average of 20 individual spectra and is presented without processing.
Figure 1A presents SERS spectra of the high
virulence DNA probe-spacer complex before hybridization (Figure 1A,I), DNA-probe hybridized with complementary high
virulence viral RNA strains (Figure 1A,II),
and the DNA-probe incubated with noncomplementary low virulence viral
RNA strains (Figure 1A,III). Figure 1B shows SERS spectra of the low virulence DNA probe-spacer
complex alone (Figure 1B,I), the spectra of
DNA-probe incubated with the noncomplementary high virulence viral
RNA strains (Figure 1B,II), and DNA-probe incubated
with the complementary low virulence viral RNA target sequence (Figure 1B,III). The dominant features found in the SERS
spectra in Figure 1 correspond to nucleic acid
vibrations, e.g., 1332, 1089, 1023, 793, and 623 cm–1.22,30

Figure 1 (A) Average SERS spectra of high virulence strains:
(I) spectra
of high virulence DNA probe, (II) spectra of high virulence DNA probe
with complementary high virulence RNA strains (N66S, A/CK/TX, A/CK/MI),
(III) spectra of DNA probe with noncomplementary low virulence RNA
strains (WH, A/CK/PA). (B) Average SERS spectra of low virulence strains:
(I) spectra of low virulence DNA probe, (II) spectra of LPAIV DNA
probe with noncomplementary high virulence RNA strains (N66S, A/CK/TX,
A/CK/MI), and (III) spectra of the low virulence DNA probe with complementary
low virulence RNA strains (WH, A/CK/PA).

The high virulence target RNA was distinguished from low
virulence
and control RNA using a whole-spectrum, multivariate statistical analysis
of the Raman spectra. This method has been previously employed for
detection, identification, and classification of pathogens.41−43

Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was utilized
to build multivariate classification models to discern high virulence
RNA binding to the substrate. The classification model was designed
such that 2/3 of spectra of the high virulence
and low virulence RNA complexes were designated as a calibration/training
sets, while the remaining 1/3 of the spectra
in each class were designated as the validation/prediction sets. This
separation allowed the calibration model to contain all possible variances
needed to explain the validation set. The spectra were randomly assigned
to each set in order to minimize any correlation between spectral
variances and order sequence. Cross-validation (Venetian blinds, 10
splits) was used for internal validation of the calibration model.
The optimal number of latent variables (LVs) was selected based on
the cross-validated class error.

Figure 2A,B represents the PLS-DA prediction
results for the high virulence and low virulence assays, respectively,
as a function of sample number. The prediction results for the samples
in Figure 2 include both the calculated values
for the calibration sets as well as the predicted values for the validation
sets. Each icon in Figure 2 represents a SERS
spectrum; the color code and shape of the symbol represents the particular
class of samples the spectrum belongs to, as defined in the caption
to Figure 2. The optimum threshold value for
sample classification is represented by the red dashed line in Figure 2; the threshold is calculated using Bayes’
Theorem based on the minimization of total classification errors.44 Spectra with predicted values greater than the
Bayesian threshold are designated as belonging to a particular category,
as defined by the classification model.

Each colored symbol represents the PLS predicted value for an individual
SERS spectrum after incubation of isolated viral RNA at 37 °C
for 2 h with the matching DNA probe. (A) Samples 1–40 represent
the calibration sets of SERS spectra containing the high virulence
strains, including: WH N66S (red ▼), A/CK/TX167280-04/02 (green
★), and A/MuteSwan/MS451072/06 (blue ■). Samples 41–105
represent the calibration sets of low virulence strains and controls,
including WH (green ●), A/CK/PA/13609/93 (pink ◇), WH
ΔPB1-F2 (yellow ▲), binding buffer (gray ◀), and
DNA probe (brown ▶). Samples 106–124 and 125–160
are the validation sets for the high virulence and low virulence/control
samples, respectively. (B) Samples 27–38 and 65–76 repent
the predicted PLS-DA classification values for the calibration sets
of SERS spectra containing the low virulence strains WH (green ●)
and A/CK/PA/13609/93 (pink ◇), while samples 112–120
and 140–146 represent the validation sets used to test this
model.

Figure 2A represents the results of a PLS-DA
classification model designed to identify high virulence strains.
Samples 1–40 in Figure 2A represent
the predicted PLS-DA classification values for the training set of
SERS spectra containing the high virulence strains, including WH N66S,
(red ▼), A/CK/TX167280-04/02 (green ★), and A/Mute Swan/MS451072/06
(blue ■). Samples 41–105 represent the predicted classification
values for the training set of LPAIV strains and controls, including
LPAIV RNA isolated from strains WH (green ●), A/CK/PA/13609/93
(pink ◇), and WH ΔPB1-F2 (yellow ▲); controls
included the buffer (gray ◀) and the DNA HPAIV capture probe
alone (brown ▶). It is clear from Figure 2A that this method unambiguously separates the spectra of the high
and low virulence strains in the calibration sets with complete accuracy.

This high virulence classification model was tested using samples
106–124 and 125–160, which were the validation sets
for the high virulence and low virulence/control samples, respectively.
Figure 2A qualitatively indicates that this
high virulence model accurately classified both low and high virulence
validation sets; Table 1 provides the quantitative
values. The results show 100% calculated sensitivities and specificities,
with root-mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) values of 0.21 for
both classes. The overall percentage of test samples correctly classified
by the high virulence PLS-DA model was 100%.

b % CC = percent of samples correctly

Figure 2B
represents the complementary situation
for a classification model designed to identify low virulence strains.
In similar fashion to Figure 2A, samples 27–38
and 65–76 in Figure 2B represent the
predicted PLS-DA classification values for the calibration sets of
SERS spectra containing the low virulence strains WH (green ●)
and A/CK/PA/13609/93 (pink ◇), while samples 112–120
and 140–146 represent the validation sets used to test this
model. Similar to the high virulence model in Figure 2A, the low virulence model in Figure 2B indicates high classification accuracy. Table 1 provides the quantitative results for the low virulence model:
calculated sensitivities and specificities of 100% and RMSEP of 0.22,
with an overall percentage of correctly classified test samples of
100%. Results from the PLS-DA models show extremely high sensitivities,
specificities, and percent correct classification, albeit with relatively
high values for RMSEP.

While PLS-DA is a powerful tool for classification
and regression,
it is not optimized for use with complex, nonlinear data sets.45,46 Support vector machine-discriminant analysis (SVM-DA) is a relatively
new classification and regression method that can produce a unique,
global solution when presented with high-dimensional inputs.47,48 We applied SVM for classification of the high and low virulence
strains described above.

For SVM-DA analysis, a radial basis
function (RBF) kernel was used
and the SVM model was calculated by grid searching within a range
of paired values of cost (C = penalty error) and
radial width (γ). In this formulation, SVM required fitting
two parameters for optimization. The first is γ, defined as
γ = 1/(2σ2), where σ is the radial width
of the RBF that determines the shape of the hyperplane that best separates
the different classes. The second parameter C takes
into account the regression errors of the training set and controls
the complexities of the class boundaries. Once the optimal parameters
were determined for the calibration set, the test set was loaded and
class membership probabilities calculated using the established SVM-DA
calibration model.

The SVM-DA model structure in terms of calibration
and validation
sets was identical to that described for PLS-DA (see above). The calibration
set was first compressed by choosing an optimized rank of latent variables
as determined from a cross-validated principal least-squares (PLS)
calculation. The optimal pair of SVM parameters (C, γ) was chosen by cross validation (Venetian blinds, 5 splits)
of the calibration set. The values used were γ = 100 and C = 0.316 for the high virulence assay and γ = 100
and C = 0.001 for the low virulence assay. A total
of 19 support vectors were used in the calculations for both assays.

Figure 3 illustrates the results from the
SVM-DA calculations for a high virulence classification model. As
in the case of the PLS-DA model (Figure 2A),
samples 1–40 represent the training set of SERS spectra containing
the HPAIV strains, samples 41–105 represent the training set
of low virulence strains and controls, while samples 106–124
and 125–160 are the test sets for the high virulence and low
virulence/control samples, respectively. The ordinate axis in Figure 3 is the predicted class membership probability,
as calculated by the SVM-DA model. In a binary classification model,
the closer the class predicted probability is to 0.0 or 1.0, the more
likely the sample is to belong to that particular class. Figure 3A shows that SVM fully separates the high virulence
test samples from the low virulence and control samples. Table 2 quantifies the results: the SVM model provides
100% specificity and sensitivity for prediction with 100% of test
samples correctly classified. In addition, the SVM model has a root-mean-square
error of class predicted probability (RMSECPP) of 0.07, showing a
much lower prediction error compare to PLS-DA model, which had an
RMSEP value of 0.21.

A similar situation occurs for the
low virulence assay illustrated
in Figure 3B, in which samples 27–38
and 65–76 represent the predicted SVM class membership probabilities
for the calibration sets of SERS spectra containing the low virulence
strains WH and A/CK/PA/13609/93, while samples 112–120 and
140–146 represent the validation sets used to test this model.
Table 2 provides the quantitative results:
the SVM low virulence model showed 100% sensitivity and specificity
for prediction with 100% of the test samples correctly classified.
The SVM model also had a RMSECPP of 0.06, compared with the prediction
errors associated with PLS-DA, i.e., an RMSEP value of 0.22.

Conclusions
We report here the first use of oligonucleotide-modified substrates
as diagnostic tools for the direct identification of a PB1-F2 mutation
in the influenza virus genome related to virulence, specifically the
N66S gene mutation within the PB1-F2 protein. The method employed
5′-thiol-modified ssDNA sequences as probes to capture RNA
isolated from avian and reverse genetics influenza viruses containing
low virulence or high virulence determinants. We used a label-free
and amplification-free optical read-out method, i.e., Raman spectroscopy,
to determine the efficacy of binding. The Raman spectra of both high
virulence and low virulence DNA-RNA target complexes showed high similarity;
therefore, multivariate analysis was used to identify target binding.
Binary classification models were developed to distinguish complementary
from noncomplementary DNA-RNA target hybrids. The SVM-DA model that
was developed using a radial basis function kernel resulted in calculated
values of 100% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 100% correct classification
of the test samples with a small root-mean-square error of prediction
(RMSECPP ∼0.07).

The current study was designed to demonstrate
the ability of the
SERS methodology to identify different virulence genotypes from real
RNA virus-containing specimens, not to determine a lower limit of
detection of the assay. However, a previous study using the same ssDNA
PB1-F2 probes employed in this article demonstrated that these SERS-based
methods were an order of magnitude more sensitive than ELISA for the
capture of synthetic influenza RNA target sequences (10 nM vs 100
nM).30 Also, in terms of the use of these
methods for complex biological samples, we have previously shown that
the SERS methods described in this paper were simultaneously able
to identify eight human rotavirus strains and classify each according
to its G or P genotype with >96% accuracy.49 Other studies showed that our SERS-based methods had equivalent-or-better
detection limits than qPCR for analysis of pathogens in complex clinical
samples.50 Therefore, based on our previous
experience, we feel confident that the methods described here can
be extended to analyze biologically complex mixtures.

These
studies establish that optical-based Raman diagnostic methods
are able to sensitively and accurately detect influenza virus RNA
mutations linked to pathogenicity in emerging highly pathogenic avian
and pandemic influenza viruses without amplification or labeling.
The results are also the first demonstration of the use of real influenza
viral RNA for direct identification of diagnostic indicators of influenza
virulence. Future work will address the applicability and robustness
of this platform for more relevant samples containing the target viral
RNA in complex influenza isolates.
