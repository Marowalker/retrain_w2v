Realizing personalized medicine,
which promises to enable early
disease detection, efficient diagnostic staging, and therapeutic efficacy
monitoring, hinges on biomarker quantification in patient samples.
Yet, the lack of a sensitive technology and assay methodology to rapidly
validate biomarker candidates continues to be a bottleneck for clinical
translation. In our first direct and quantitative comparison of backscattering
interferometry (BSI) to fluorescence sensing by ELISA, we show that
BSI could aid in overcoming this limitation. The analytical validation
study was performed against ELISA for two biomarkers for lung cancer
detection: Cyfra 21-1 and Galectin-7. Spiked serum was used for calibration
and comparison of analytical figures of merit, followed by analysis
of blinded patient samples. Using the ELISA antibody as the probe
chemistry in a mix-and-read assay, BSI provided significantly lower
detection limits for spiked serum samples with each of the biomarkers.
The limit of quantification (LOQ) for Cyrfa-21-1 was measured to be
230 pg/mL for BSI versus 4000 pg/mL for ELISA, and for Galectin-7,
it was 13 pg/mL versus 500 pg/mL. The coefficient of variation for
5 day, triplicate determinations was <15% for BSI and <10% for
ELISA. The two techniques correlated well, ranging from 3–29%
difference for Cyfra 21-1 in a blinded patient sample analysis. The
label-free and free-solution operation of BSI allowed for a significant
improvement in analysis speed, with greater ease, improved LOQ values,
and excellent day-to-day reproducibility. In this unoptimized format,
BSI required 5.5-fold less sample quantity needed for ELISA (a 10
point calibration curve measured in triplicate required 36 μL
of serum for BSI vs 200 μL for ELISA). The results indicate
that the BSI platform can enable rapid, sensitive analytical validation
of serum biomarkers and should significantly impact the validation
bottleneck of biomarkers.

==== Body
The quantification
of protein
biomarkers at physiologically relevant levels is essential for individualized
medicine and early-stage disease diagnostics to be realized. Researchers
consider that several factors are impeding the translation of biomarkers
into the clinic. Among the major contributors for the clinical translation
bottleneck are the intrinsic biological variability in large cohorts
of samples for systemic biomarkers, the relatively long development
time for assays, and the need for assays with more sensitivity.

Many methods have been developed to detect biomarkers, study pathogenesis,
and follow pharmacologic response in cancer, yet they all have limitations
with respect to clinical translation. Among the most common methods
are ELISA, bead array technologies, label-free techniques such as
surface plasmon resonance (SPR), quartz-crystal microbalance, wave-guided
interferometry1−3 (Table 1), and mass spectrometry
(MS).4,5 Some of these platforms report single-molecule
sensitivity6 and have shown the potential
to impact clinical practice.7 Yet, these
techniques have deficiencies with respect to validation, principally
related to speed, reproducibility, cost, and/or accessibility.4 Although MS has been exceedingly valuable in
the biomarker discovery phase,8,9 current instrumentation
complexity and difficulty with quantification make its use in clinical
validation unattractive.10 Multiplexed
MRM/MS targeted assays using stable-isotope-labeled peptide standards
for accurate quantitation are showing promise as clinical diagnostic
assays, yet complexity and low-throughput remain as challenges. The
requirement of other platforms for either surface immobilization and/or
labeling steps makes assay development and species validation arduous,
slow, and expensive. Therefore, free-solution methods, particularly
those that are label-free, represent an attractive alternative to
ELISA.

It is true that significant strides
have been made toward miniaturizing
and multiplexing ELISA.21−23 Table 1 also illustrates that improving the limit of detection of labeled
assays has been possible. One example is the use of electrochemiluminescent
assays, which are typically 10-fold more sensitive than the standard
fluorescent analogue.24 Yet these and the
other amplification chemistries needed to accomplish femtomolar detection
limits carry relatively high costs, long development times, and high
failure rates,24 extending the interval
between biomarker discovery and clinical validation. Furthermore,
the large sample consumption associated with some of these methods
impedes validation of promising biomarkers due to the preciousness
of the available banked samples on relevant patient populations.10,25 As shown from Table 1, backscattering interferometry
(BSI) represents the most sensitive label-free method and can give
comparable detection limits to fluorescent assays.

In addition
to analytical limitations, researchers also consider
the intrinsic biological variability in large cohorts of samples to
be a major contributor to the clinical translation bottleneck for
systemic biomarkers.

As in any assay based on detecting a binding
event, the specificity
and sensitivity of BSI are impacted by the equilibrium binding affinity, KD. In general, the higher the affinity, the
lower the potential limit of detection. However, the sensitivity of
all interaction-based determinations is impacted by other factors.
Fluorescence performance is impacted by quantum efficiencies, and
absorbance sensitivity is linked to the molar absorptivity of the
analyte. In BSI, the two predominant parameters impacting assay performance
are the number of bonds formed (or broken)26 and the magnitude of change in dipole moment (RI) due to conformation/hydration
changes during the binding event.

To test the analytical utility
of BSI for biomarker method development
and validation, we chose to study two potential biomarkers of lung
cancer: one currently in use and one new candidate. Nonsmall cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) is the number one cause of cancer mortality among
men and women worldwide.27 In the U.S.
alone, lung cancer kills more men and women than colorectal, prostate,
and breast cancer combined.28 Despite advances
in diagnostic and treatment strategies over the past decade, the prognosis
of patients with lung cancer remains poor. Seventy percent of patients
are diagnosed at an advanced stage,28 primarily
due to the lack of sensitive and specific detection methods, with
an overall 5 year survival rate of 15%.29,30 In response
to this critical need for a reliable early detection method, the search
for early stage noninvasive diagnostic strategies for lung cancer
detection has intensified.31 Computed tomography
(CT) is the most common method used for diagnosing lung cancer, but
CT has limitations. Lung nodules of indeterminate significance are
discovered in over 25% of the individuals screened with CT.32 As revealed by expensive and invasive diagnostic
tests used to discriminate these lesions, 96% of these hard to distinguish
nodules are benign.33 The development of
a simple, rapid, specific, noninvasive, and clinically relevant diagnostic
tool would improve early lung cancer detection, reduce the need for
unnecessary biopsies, and enable early treatment.

We hypothesized
that BSI,34,35 a simple, isothermal,
highly sensitive free-solution, label- and enzyme-free technology,
compatible with complex matrices could provide improved sensitivity
for protein biomarker analysis and reduce the assay development bottleneck
encountered with labeled and/or tethered assays. BSI is based on a
unique resonant cavity interferometric approach that can give femtomolar
sensitivity without labels, in submicroliter sample volumes. Additionally,
the BSI signal transduction mechanism makes it highly modular and
not limited by the mass of the target or probe.36 Studies have shown that ligand–receptor binding
induced conformational, solvation/desolvation, molecular polarizability,
and dipole moment changes correlate with refractive index (RI)-induced
fringe shifts observed in BSI.26,28 The ability to measure
these properties allows a wide array of interactions (antibodies to
DNA to small molecules) to be quantified with a large range of affinities
(μM to pM) regardless of the mass of the interacting species.26,34,37−39 Because RI
changes may arise from molecular interactions unrelated to target
binding, suitable blanks and controls must be prepared to ensure that
the measured changes reflect an actual binding event. In addition,
temperature control is employed to constrain background noise arising
from thermal fluctuations.

To test our hypothesis, we compared
the performance of BSI to that
of the commercially available ELISA for the quantification of two
NSCLC protein biomarkers. One was Cyfra 21-1, which is currently used
in the clinic to stage patient disease state. The other was a candidate
biomarker, Galectin-7, identified from a shotgun proteomics screen.40 Limits of quantification (LOQ) for the respective
assays were determined in spiked human serum. Next, a small set of
blinded clinical samples was evaluated. The results indicate that
BSI has the potential to rapidly and effectively quantify biomarkers
in serum or plasma with significant improvement in sensitivity compared
to ELISA, opening an avenue for rapid biomarker validation.

Experimental
Section
BSI has been described extensively in previous publications.36,41,42 Briefly, the instrument is comprised
of a helium–neon (HeNe) laser, a mirror, a microfluidic chip,
and a linear charged-coupled device (CCD) detector (Figure 1). The sample is introduced into the microfluidic
chip, which has a near-semicircular cross section, configured to create
a resonance cavity with a long effective path length. The incident
coherent light is converted into an interferometric fringe pattern,
which is captured by the CCD camera. Fourier analysis is used to determine
the phase change (in radians),43 which
is a quantitative measure of spatial position of the fringes due to
changes in refractive index (RI). These RI changes have been shown
to correlate with ligand–receptor binding36,41 and are used to quantify molecular interactions36 with subpicomolar sensitivity and a large dynamic range.34,36

Figure 1 BSI
experimental setup. The laser is directed onto the microfluidic
chip by a mirror that also serves to direct the interference fringes
on the detector. As shown, the channel in the chip has a near semicircular
cross section. When the fluid RI changes in the channel the interference
fringes shift spatially.

A calibration curve was constructed for each biomarker in
order
to determine the BSI lower limit of detection. All reagents used were
from commercial ELISA kits (DRG International and DuoSet for Cyfra
21-1 and Galectin-7 assays, respectively). Increasing concentrations
of recombinant protein [0, 0.156, 0.312, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and
10 ng/mL for Cyfra 21-1; 0, 0.41, 0.82, 1.64, 3.28, 6.56, 13.12, 26.25,
and 52.5 ng/mL for Galectin-7 (single antibody calibration); and 0,
0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.156, 0.312, 0.625, and 1.25 ng/mL for Galectin
(two antibody calibration)] spiked in 20% human serum were incubated
with a constant concentration of antibody for 1 h at room temperature
to allow for binding equilibrium. A series of blanks were similarly
prepared, using buffer in lieu of antibody. At equilibrium, 1 μL
of sample was injected into the BSI channel and measured for 30 s.
The corresponding blank was immediately measured after the sample
and subtracted from the sample signal as the background. All samples
and blanks were prepared fresh daily, then sequentially measured in
triplicate daily for 5 days.

Cyfra 21-1 and Galectin-7 calibration
curves data were fit to a
four parameters logistic model and plotted as a function of analyte
concentrations. Curve fit functions were chosen on the basis of the
best R2 value using GraphPad Prism software
package.

Calibration curves for both biomarkers were also constructed
as
a benchmark with spiked 20% human serum using commercial ELISA kits
(DRG International and DuoSet for Cyfra 21-1 and Galectin-7 assays,
respectively). The ELISA calibration curve was created using triplicate
determinations, following the manufacturer’s recommended procedure.
Lower limits of detection were calculated by determining the lowest
concentration at which the signal-to-noise ratio was ≥5. An
alternative calculation was performed using the following equation:   where σ = the average standard
deviation
of all 15 trials run over 5 separate days. The initial slope was calculated
by taking the linear regression of the lowest four concentrations
measured. The results of both methods were in close agreement.

Serum samples were collected from individuals with lung cancer
and controls from the biorepository of the thoracic program at the
Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center. Serum samples were prepared following
a previously described standard operating procedure, aliquoted, and
stored at −80 °C until analysis.40 For Galectin-7 analysis, eight samples were from patients with NSCLC
histology (stages IA-IIIA) of either squamous cell carcinoma (SCC, N = 2) or adenocarcinoma subtypes (ADC, N = 2) and controls from individuals with no sign of lung cancer (N = 4) (Table 2). Control individuals
were defined as having no evidence of lung cancer at their 1 year
follow-up exam. For Cyfra 21-1 analysis, 10 samples were from controls
(N = 5) and individuals with SCC (N = 5), as outlined in Table 2. Patient serum
samples were from individuals matched for age, gender, and smoking
history. Patient samples were prepared at a 1:5 dilution with PBS
buffer and as described previously for the spiked samples. Patient
serum samples were analyzed using a commercial ELISA kit that was
performed according to the manufacturer’s specified procedure.
The institutional review board at Vanderbilt University approved these
human studies.

Results
and Discussion
Here Cyfra 21-1 and Galectin-7 were employed
to evaluate the potential
to use BSI as a mix-and-read analysis method in biomarker validation.
It is noteworthy that this research represents an analytical assay validation study and not a clinical validation of
either the biomarker or the assay. The importance of this research
is the potential for BSI to speed biomarker assay methods development, provide improved performance over ELISA, and offer
an alternative for solving the current biomarker analytical validation
bottleneck.

In our proof-of-concept experiment, we compared
the performance
of BSI and ELISA with analysis of human serum and plasma spiked with
the protein biomarkers of interest. In all of the studies reported
here, we used the probe chemistry (antibody[s]) from the ELISA kit
for the BSI assay. Using our free-solution, mix-and-read approach,
we achieved excellent sensitivity and reproducibility by spiking human
serum with Cyfra 21-1. For example, Figure 2A presents the calibration curves for BSI and ELISA, showing a more
than a 17.3-fold increase in sensitivity. The plot also shows that
the assay was highly reproducible over a 5 day period.

Figure 2 (A) Calibration curves
for BSI with Cyfra 21-1 spiked into serum
(red triangles) and for ELISA in spiked serum (green circles). (B)
Calibration curves for Galectin-7 spiked serum show that the BSI LOQ
(blue diamonds) is better than for ELISA (green circles) and is improved
by using both the detection and capture antibodies in the assay (red
triangles). Error bars on both plots represent the standard deviation
for repeat triplicate determinations over a 5 day period.

Cyfra 21-1 is currently a NSCLC blood-based candidate
biomarker
with a concentration that has some clinical utility in that it correlates
with disease progression,44−47 but its diagnostic utility has been restricted by
the low constitutive expression in healthy individuals (2.4 ng/mL),45 a value which is well below the reported ELISA
detection limit of 10 ng/mL.48 As with
C-reactive protein (CRP), discussed below, we believe a 10–20-fold
improvement in the LOQ has the potential to expand the diagnostic
value of the Cyfra 21-1 biomarker. Here we show that one advantage
of BSI is an improved LOQ for Cyfra 21-1.

Galectin-7 was recently
identified by shotgun proteomics and has
been reported as an NSCLC tissue marker40 with the potential to serve as a diagnostic target. As with many
potential targets, Galectin-7 has yet to be validated as a useful
serum or plasma NSCLC biomarker, principally due to the time-consuming
process needed to develop a biomarker assay prior to clinical validation.
The analytical discovery and validation process currently requires
the identification of two antibodies, successful fluorescent labeling,
and capture probe immobilization chemistry to be implemented prior
to analytical testing. It is only after this arduous process is completed
that the resulting assay can be validated, first with respect to analytical
performance and then in a clinical setting. Recently, we found that
even after a great deal of optimization, the ELISA kit developed for
Galectin-7 was unable to quantify the target in low-level-expressing
patients. Thus, even though tissue studies40 suggested it should serve as an early disease marker, it was impossible
to determine the value of the protein as a serum biomarker with the
ELISA test. Here we show that we could rapidly develop a BSI assay
that had significantly improved detection limits for Galectin-7.

Figure 2B shows that overall the calibration
curves for BSI and ELISA show a more than 38-fold increase in sensitivity.
The LOQ for BSI was about 13-fold better than for ELISA (39 pg/mL
shown in the blue trace vs 500 pg/mL shown in the green trace) using
the detection antibody. Capitalizing on our recent observation that
the BSI signal is proportional not only to the quantity of interacting
species leading to conformation and hydration changes upon binding
but also to the number of binding events within a molecule, we simply
added the capture antibody to the assay to improve sensitivity.26 The use of multiple probes (or even different
types) is predicted to improve the LOQ and potentially increase specificity.
Figure 2B illustrates the significant performance
improvement of BSI performance by using both the capture and detection
antibody from a DuoSet human Galectin-7 ELISA kit. In this case, comparison
of the red trace to the blue trace in Figure 2B illustrates a 3-fold improvement in LOQ for Galectin-7 in spiked
serum by simply employing both the capture and detection antibodies
(13 pg/mL vs 39 pg/mL). The data in this figure represents triplicate
determinations performed on 5 subsequent days (n =
15). Although not demonstrated here, we have shown with Bock and Tasset
aptatmers to thrombin that BSI is unique in that careful selection
of the binding pair and order of addition can increase both the affinity
and the S/N of the measurement.38

Table 3 summarizes our ELISA-BSI comparison
results for the two biomarkers studied. Over a 5 day period, the BSI
LOQ was 38-fold better than ELISA for Galectin-7 and 17-fold better
for Cyfra 21-1. The coefficient of variation (CV) was less than 15%
at the LOQ for all BSI assays, showing excellent assay precision and
reproducibility using a research laboratory instrument.

is 10 000 pg/mL.

It is possible to further improve the ELISA detection limits using
methods that employ additional signal amplification and/or noise reduction
methods. For example Lee et al. recently reported the quantification
of Cyfra 21-1 using Luminex at levels as low as 0.01 ng/mL.49 They present data for healthy patients ranging
from 0.01 to 0.73 ng/mL and cancer patients having 0.66 to 2.4 ng/mL,
yet the manufacturer reports a minimum detection concentration at
2 times the standard deviation of 0.059 ng/mL. Here we use a more
conservative measure of performance, the LOQ, which is based on 3
times the standard deviation of the assay run over 5 days. Comparing
BSI to the bead-based assay is difficult in this case, but the BSI
LOQ (not the LOD at 2σ) exhibits >1.5-fold improvement and
is
performed as a free-solution and label-free method.49,50 Electrochemiluminescence assays have demonstrated detection limits
comparable to ours reported here,25,49,50 yet these assays are expensive and require substantial
chemical complexity in both the assay discovery and analytical validation
phase.

Next, we demonstrated that BSI can be used to quantify
these biomarkers
in patient samples in a blinded fashion, using a small set of previously
characterized samples spanning a range of lung cancer stages (see
Table 2). As with the spiked samples, serum
was diluted 1:5 with PBS buffer, split into aliquots, and analyzed
individually for Cyfra 21-1 and Galecitn-7. A 1:10 dilution of antibody,
(1 μL of antibody solution/9 μL of serum) was incubated
at room temperature for 1 h. A reference sample of the same serum
dilution with buffer was run in tandem with each patient sample to
correct for bulk RI changes inherent to the sample. The difference
in shift between the sample and the reference was recorded, and the
concentration of the biomarker in each patient sample was determined
using the appropriate response curve (Figures 2A,B) for Cyfra 21-1 or Galectin-7. Again, assays were performed in
triplicate daily for 5 days (n = 15).

Figure 3A shows BSI and ELISA results plotted
on a log-scale versus patient number for the quantification of Cyfra
21-1. In this set, there were five samples from patients with disease
(cases) and five from patients without (controls). Figure 3B shows the data on an expanded scale, covering
slightly more than 1 decade in concentration. At this scale, the error
bars for the 15 replicate determinations become visible, as well as
the difference in Cyfra 21-1 concentration determined by the two methods.
Overall, the BSI correlated with ELISA measurements (3–29%
difference), with the cases and controls segregating as expected (see
Figure 5A). In this case, we chose five patients
with relatively advanced disease (four at stage IV and one at stage
IIIA-IIIB) and five controls derived from patients that do not currently have detectable disease. Yet, as shown by the
LOQ cutoff lines on the plot, the threshold for quantifying the biomarker
with confidence for the two methodologies is considerably different.
This enhanced sensitivity could allow for more accurate stratification
of patients with existing NSCLC. As discussed below, because Cyfra
21-1 has relatively low constitutive expression (near the LOQ for
ELISA), this sensitivity advantage for quantifying Cyfra 21-1 in serum
could allow for earlier detection of disease and/or enable monitoring
therapeutic response in NSCLC.40

Figure 3 Determination
of Cyfra 21-1 concentration in human patient serum
samples using BSI and ELISA and the calibration plots shown in Figure 2. (A) Cyfra 21-1 concentrations determined by BSI
and ELISA plotted on a log scale and compared to the LOQ for each
method. (B) Expanded y-axis illustrates the similarities
of the measured Cyfra 21-1 concentration for both methods. Error bars
on both plots represent 15 independent measurements performed over
5 days.

Our patient sample analysis for
Galectin-7 (Figure 5) was less conclusive with
respect to case/control discrimination
and calls into question the diagnostic potential of the this biomarker.
Tissue ELISA results suggested Galectin-7 was a promising biomarker
of lung cancer (data not shown). Yet here, as with other biomarkers,
the tissue and serum data do not correlate. Galectin-7 may still have
clinical utility when this sample type is available, yet our results
indicate that serum levels are not predictive of the presence of disease.

The findings illustrate several advantages of BSI in the biomarker
validation phase. First, the high sensitivity of BSI, with all Galectin-7
samples being within the LOQ, provides reasonable confidence that
poor assay performance is not the discordance of the tissue–serum
results. Second, mix-and-read operation allowed for us to rapidly
establish in a small but relevant patient population that there was
no correlation between the serum and tissue biomarker expression levels.
This is a critical step in validation, providing a check point before
investing time and resources on further assay development. Third,
BSI can be used with existing antibodies (probe chemistry) to provide
a significantly improved LOQ over the conventional fluorescent assay.

Figure 4 illustrates the BSI and ELISA results
for serum correlate in general; however, they show differences of
as much as 40-fold. Yet, the ELISA plasma results correlate well with
the BSI serum values. It is also important to note that the serum
versus plasma ELISA results also exhibit differences approaching 50-fold,
with improved assay performance in serum. Currently, we are investigating
the source of the disparity between these measurements, and although
not within the scope of this report, we hypothesize that a combination
of chemical and localized environmental factors may be the culprits.

Figure 4 Determination
of Galectin-7 concentration in human patient serum
samples using BSI and ELISA and the calibration plots shown in Figure 2. BSI was able to quantify the Galectin-7 concentration
in all eight patient serum samples, yet half of these samples have
a biomarker concentration below the ELISA limit of detection (highlighted
in yellow box). Error bars on the plots represent 15 independent measurements
performed over 5 days.

The majority of protein detection platforms recognize a specific
binding event to a target molecule, requiring both a signal transducer
and immobilization of the probe. This is not the case with BSI, which
is a label-free and free-solution platform, compatible with many probes,
targets, and events. ELISAs, protein microarrays,51−54 and even quantum dot55 platforms have a readout that is either fluorescent
or colorimetric. Matrix autofluorescence or intrinsic absorption of
the samples or reagents can be a major limiting factor in these methods.
pH and ionic strength can also impact an assay, particularly one performed
in the tethered mode. Just a 0.14 M salt solution (similar to human
serum) has been shown to have sufficient Debye forces to shield nanowires
from detecting protein binding events.56 In our own57 and collaborators’
laboratories,39 we have illustrated that
ligand binding in surface-immobilized formats are inherently susceptible
to slight changes in the binding environment and that BSI can discriminate
these perturbations.57 Even though LOQ
performance of BSI is impacted by environment (Figure 2A) for Cyfra 21-1, using the same matrix for
the reference/control as we do in BSI provides some inherent immunity
to these influences.34,35 In theory, as long as the measurements
are performed within the dynamic operation range of the assay quantification
accuracy should be maintained. Studies are currently underway to confirm
our hypothesis and address these disparities.

The LOQ is critical
to the successful deployment of a predictive
biomarker assay.4,58−60 Figures 2–4 all show that BSI
has a significant LOQ advantage over standard ELISA, allowing for
the analysis of four Galectin-7 samples that could not be quantified
with the fluorescent method. Three of these patient samples had a
target concentration well below the LOQ and one of them was near the
high end of the dynamic range. It is in this lower region that we
believe the high sensitivity of BSI will provide the opportunity to
expand the use of biomarker assays in the clinic, as was the case
for hsCRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein assay).61−63

The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), a reliability
index,
was calculated to evaluate the reproducibility of the BSI measurements
for both Cyfra 21-1 and Galectin-7, and this determination is shown
in Figure 5. The
ICC was determined to be 0.93 for Cyfra and 0.96 for Galectin, demonstrating
that the variation of the measurements on the same sample is significantly
lower than the variation of the measurement of two different samples,
an indication that the measurement has a high degree of accuracy.
These data also illustrate a clear separation between case and control
samples for Cyfra 21-1, as expected for this biomarker. However, the
patient samples analyzed for Galectin-7 show a much wider range of
concentrations, regardless of cancer stage (Table 2), and even though the patient sample sets studied were relatively
small, these results bring into question the value of this protein
as a circulating biomarker of NSCLC. For both ELISA and BSI, Galectin-7
was present in serum at the levels necessary to provide the sensitivity
and selectivity to accurately discern between cases and controls.
As noted above, this biomarker likely represents an example where
there is a poor correlation between tissue expression and circulating
levels in serum.

Figure 5 Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) plots for BSI
assays.
(A) Raw patient sample data for Cyfra 21-1 measured each day in triplicate
for 5 separate days. The 15 measurements (dots) of the control samples
(blue) and the case samples (red) show a clear differentiation between
disease states seen by the dotted line. (B) Raw patient sample data
for Galectin-7 measured each day in triplicate for 5 days. Although
the 15 measurements (dots) of all the samples are well above the BSI
LOQ (dashed line), the control samples (blue) and the case samples
(red) do not show a differentiation. Red and blue arrows point to
patient samples that put into question the validity of this biomarker.

To illustrate the potential of
our approach, we cite an analogy
to the development of the CRP assay. The CRP assay was discovered
many years ago and was used on a limited basis as an inflammation
marker. Yet, recently it has become a standard clinical measurement
for cardiovascular disease (CVD),62 which
is due in great part to a dramatic performance improvement (20-fold)
afforded by the hsCRP assay. It was the hsCRP assay that allowed the
demonstration of a correlation for this biomarker and CVD.62 Higher sensitivity or improved LOQ performance
enabled the quantification of this rather abundant protein at very
low concentrations,61,62 and the demonstration of its
presence correlates well with various degrees of CVD, providing a
standard of care for risk assessment.63,64 Another example
has been shown with PSA.7,65 In this case, the fifth-generation
PSA assay capitalizes on amplified ELISA and femtoliter volumes to
approach single-molecule detection and shows promise in providing
additional clinical insights about recurrence for prostate cancer
patients.

Assay speed, simplicity, sensitivity, and cost significantly
impacts
the effectiveness of biomarker validation. Further, the precious nature
of the samples requires that sample consumption be minimized. The
entire assay was performed on 5.5-fold less sample volume than that
required by ELISA (10 point calibration curve measured in triplicate
required 36 μL of serum for BSI vs 200 μL for ELISA),
and optimization may reduce this volume along with reduced reagent
consumption. If existing ELISA kits are available and used, then the
speed of the actual determination is similar. Both methods require
incubation, but BSI does not demand numerous rinsing steps, as in
the sandwich assay and plate reading steps required for ELISA, thus
significantly speeding the process. Dose–response curves are
constructed by simply incubating increasing concentrations of the
recombinant protein spiked into human serum with 100 ng/mL of the
antibody from an ELISA kit. With respect to clinical validation, a
major bottleneck continues to be the time needed to perform analytical
validation (development and characterization) of the assay before
the necessary step of an expansive set of patient samples being fully
characterized. Often, as with Galectin-7, after weeks to months of
development, the final fluorescent assay performance negates use for
a clinical validation. The mix-and-read and label-free nature of BSI
allows numerous probe chemistries (antibodies, aptamers, and small
molecules) to be characterized and optimized in just hours to days.
If necessary, BSI can also be used in the tethered format and without
the inherent mass sensitivity limitations encountered with SPR and
similar methods. Thus, when desirable, we can rapidly develop an assay
in free solution and then translate it to the clinical setting in
a disposable chip format without concern that changing the format
will impact performance.

Conclusions
Here we demonstrated
that BSI enables the quantification of NSCLC
biomarkers in complex biological matrices at concentrations that are
up to 40-fold lower than commonly used assays (Table 3). BSI also characterized patient serum samples in good agreement
with results by the current gold standard in disease diagnosis (ELISA).
The free-solution and label-free assay format allows optimization
in hours to days, instead of weeks or months, expediting the biomarker
validation process. In addition, BSI requires less sample volume,
allowing a wider array of biomarkers and probes to be investigated
during the initial screening phase of the validation process. In our
small set of blinded patient samples, BSI compared well with ELISA.
Our ongoing BSI performance optimization efforts26 indicates new probes such as aptamers have potential to
enhance NSCLC biomarker quantification, whereas our exploration of
two promising sample introduction strategies shows the promise of
volume-constrained increased throughput in BSI. One approach is optical,
and the other capitalizes on microfluidics. Taken collectively, it
is possible that the high sensitivity and simplicity of the BSI assay
will expedite the validation of biomarkers for disease diagnosis,
risk assessment, and response to therapy.
