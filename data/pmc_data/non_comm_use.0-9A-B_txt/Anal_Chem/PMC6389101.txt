Multiplexing
and quantification of nucleic acids, both have, in
their own right, significant and extensive use in biomedical related
fields. Currently, the ability to detect several nucleic acid targets
in a single-reaction scales linearly with the number of targets; an
expensive and time-consuming feat. Here, we propose a new methodology
based on multidimensional standard curves that extends the use of
real-time PCR data obtained by common qPCR instruments. By applying
this novel methodology, we achieve simultaneous single-channel multiplexing
and enhanced quantification of multiple targets using only real-time
amplification data. This is obtained without the need of fluorescent
probes, agarose gels, melting curves or sequencing analysis. Given
the importance and demand for tackling challenges in antimicrobial
resistance, the proposed method is applied to four of the most prominent
carbapenem-resistant genes: blaOXA-48, blaNDM, blaVIM, and blaKPC, which account for 97% of
the UK’s reported carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae.

==== Body
This work
demonstrates simultaneous
multiplex qPCR and absolute quantification using standard curves,
employing only a single fluorescence channel without post-PCR analysis;
such that it can be used with conventional qPCR instruments. This
is achieved by extending the quantification framework proposed by
Moniri et al.,1 to establish that multidimensional
standard curves (MSCs) can also be used for target identification.
The proposed method is validated for the detection of the β-lactamase
genes blaOXA-48, blaNDM, blaVIM, and blaKPC using bacterial isolates from clinical samples in
a single-reaction; without fluorescent probes, agarose gels, melting
curves or sequencing analysis. Table 1 summarizes the breakdown of confirmed carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) cases in the U.K. from 2003
to 2015. The chosen drug-resistant genes in this study cover over
97% of the total reported cases. Diagnostic instruments that incorporate
our methodology will greatly expand the applicability of emerging
molecular technologies.2,3

a Data obtained from the Public Health
England’s Antimicrobial resistance and healthcare associated
infections reference unit.4

Invasive infections with carbapenemase-producing
strains are associated
with high mortality rates (up to 40–50%) and represent a major
public health concern worldwide.5,6 Rapid and accurate screening
for carriage of CPE is essential for successful infection prevention
and control strategies, as well as bed management.7,8 However,
routine laboratory detection of CPE based on carbapenem susceptibility
is challenging:9 (i) culture-based methods
have limited sensitivity and a long turnaround time; (ii) nucleic
acid amplification techniques (NAATs) are often too expensive and
require sophisticated equipment to be used as a screening tool in
healthcare systems; and (iii) multiplexed NAATs have not been able
to meet the demand for high-level multiplexing using available technologies.

There is an unmet clinical need for new molecular tools that can
be successfully adopted within existing healthcare settings. The proposed
method allows existing technologies to benefit from the advantages
of multiplex PCR assays while reducing the complexity of CPE screening,
resulting in a time- and cost-effective solution. This is enabled
through changing the fundamental approach to current data analytic
techniques for the quantification of nucleic acids from unidimensional
to multidimensional. Figure 1 compares both (a) the conventional approach versus (b) the
proposed method for single-channel multiplexing. In the first, conventional
standard curves are constructed but multiple targets cannot be differentiated
and quantified without post-PCR processing. In contrast, the proposed
method constructs multidimensional standard curves, extracting more
information from the amplification curves, allowing for simultaneous
quantification and multiplexing in a single channel. This work uses
CPE as a clinically relevant case study; however, the authors invite
researchers to explore other targets and amplification chemistries
in order to expand the capabilities of current state-of-the art technologies.

quantitative PCR using a unidimensional and multidimensional approach.
An unknown DNA sample is amplified by multiplex qPCR for targets 1,

and γ are extracted from the amplification curve. It is important
to stress that any number of targets and features could have been
chosen. (a) Unidimensional analysis. Three conventional standard curves
are generated through serial dilution of the known targets using a
single feature. Given it is not possible to identify the target based
on these standard curves, post-PCR analysis is required for target
identification and quantification. (b) Multidimensional analysis.
Three multidimensional standard curves are constructed through serial
dilution of the known targets using multiple features. The unknown
samples can be confidently classified and enhanced quantification
can be achieved by combining all the features into a unified feature
called M0.1

Experimental Section
Primers and Amplification
Reaction Conditions
All oligonucleotides
used in this study were synthesized by IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies,
Germany), with no additional purification. Primers were previously
reported by Monteiro et al.10 (see Table 2). Each amplification
reaction was performed in 5 μL of final volume with 2.5 μL
of FastStart Essential DNA Green Master 2× concentrated (Roche
Diagnostics, Germany), 1 μL of PCR grade water, 0.5 μL
of 10× multiplex PCR primer mixture containing the four primer
sets (5 μM of each primer), and 1 μL of different concentrations
of synthetic DNA or bacterial genomic DNA. PCR amplifications consisted
of 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 45 cycles at 95 °C for 20
s, 68 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. In order to validate
the proposed method, the results were compared against melting curve
analyses. One melting cycle was performed at 95 °C for 10 s,
65 °C for 60 s, and 97 °C for 1 s (continuous reading from
65 to 97 °C). Each experimental condition was run 5–8
times, loading the reactions into Light Cycler 480 Multiwell Plates
96 (Roche Diagnostics, Germany) using a Light Cycler 96 Real-Time
PCR System (Roche Diagnostics, Germany). Appropriate negative and
positive controls were included in each experiment.

Synthetic DNA and Bacterial Isolates
Four synthetic
double-stranded DNA (gBlock Gene fragments) were purchased from IDT
and resuspended in TE buffer to 10 ng/μL stock solutions (stored
at −20 °C until further use). The concentrations of all
DNA stock solutions were determined using a Qubit 3.0 fluorimeter
(Life Technologies). The synthetic templates contained the DNA sequence
from blaOXA-48, blaNDM, blaVIM, and blaKPC genes required for the multiplex qPCR assay (Table S1). Standard curves were constructed utilizing
different DNA concentrations as follows: blaOXA-48 (108–104 copies/reaction), blaNDM (107–101 copies/reaction), blaVIM (108–103 copies/reaction),
and blaKPC (108–103 copies/reaction). Pure bacterial cultures from clinical isolates
were used in this study, as described in Table 3. One loop of colonies from each pure culture
was suspended in 50 μL of digestion buffer at pH 8.0 (Tris-HCl
10 mmol/L, EDTA 1 mmol/L, and 5 U/μL lysozyme) and incubated
at 37 °C for 30 min in a dry bath. Subsequently, 0.75 μL
of proteinase K at 20 μg/μL (Sigma) was added, and the
solution was incubated at 56 °C for 30 min. Afterward, the solution
was boiled for 10 min to inactivate proteinase K, the samples were
centrifuged at 10000 × g for 5 min and the supernatant was transferred
in a new tube and stored at −80 °C before use. Sample
9 was generated by mixing sample 6 and 8 at equal proportions. Non-CPE
producers Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli were included as control strains.

Multidimensional Standard Curves
The data analysis
for simultaneous quantification and multiplexing is achieved by extending
the framework described in Moniri et al.1 This framework provides a generalization of the approach for quantification
of nucleic acids using standard curves. The stages of data analysis
are as follows: preprocessing, curve-fitting, multiple feature extraction,
high-dimensional line fitting, similarity measure, feature weighting,
and dimensionality reduction. The major difference with the conventional
approach to quantification is that multiple features are extracted
from amplification curves. The stages used in this work, also referred
to as the instance of framework, are described below and summarized
in Table 4.

i Preprocessing
The only preprocessing
common to all features in this instance of framework is background
subtraction. This is accomplished using baseline subtraction by removing
the mean of the first five fluorescence readings from every amplification
curve.

ii Curve Fitting
The chosen model for
curve fitting is the 5-parameter sigmoid (Richards Curve) given by
the following: 1  where x is
the cycle number, F(x) is the fluorescence
at cycle x, Fb is the
background fluorescence, Fmax is the maximum fluorescence, c is the fractional
cycle of the inflection point, b is related to the
slope of the curve, and d allows for an asymmetric
shape (Richard’s coefficient).

The optimization algorithm
used to fit the curve to the data is the trust-region method and is
based on the interior reflective Newton method.17,18 The lower and upper bounds for the five parameters, [Fb, Fmax, c, b, d], are given as
[−0.5, −0.5, 0, 0, 0.7] and [0.5, 0.5, 50, 100, 10],
respectively.

iii Feature Extraction
The features extracted
from the amplification curves are: Ct, Cy, and −log10(F0). Therefore, each point in the feature
space is a vector in 3-dimensional space, that is, p = [Ct, Cy, −log10(F0)]T where [·]T denotes the transpose operator. Note that, by convention, for the
formulas in this paper, vectors are denoted using bold lowercase letters,
and matrices are indicated using bold uppercase letters.

In
order to compute the cycle-threshold, Ct, first the amplification curve is fit with the 5-parameter sigmoid
in eq 1. The fit is then
normalized with respect to the maximum fluorescence and Ct is equal to the time where the fit exceeds 0.2 (i.e.,
20% of its maximum fluorescence). The second feature, proposed by
Guescini et al.,13 referred to as Cy, also uses the 5-parameter
sigmoidal curve-fitting and takes Cy as the intersection between the abscissa axis and
the tangent of the inflection point from the obtained Richards curve.
The final feature, proposed by Rutledge,14 referred to in this paper as F0, fits
the sigmoid up to a “cut-off cycle” and takes F0 as the fluorescence at cycle 0.

Each
feature has an underlying assumption and, therefore, the combination
of the features are expected to increase the amount of information
obtained from the amplification curve. For example, the Ct approach assumes the PCR efficiency to be constant between
reactions and cycles. The Cy approach allows for different efficiency between reactions but assumes
a constant efficiency between cycles. The third feature, F0, allows for different efficiency between reactions but
additionally assumes that it decreases from cycle to cycle. The reader
may wish to review these papers to understand each feature in greater
depth.12−14

iv Line Fitting
In
this work, the line
fitting, which is essentially constructing the MSC, is achieved by
using the first principal direction in principal component analysis
(PCA); or equivalently, the method of least squares.

v Similarity Measure
The similarity measure
used is the Mahalanobis distance, d, as seen in eq 3.18 This is a measure of similarity between a test point, p, and the distribution of training points from a
specific MSC. 2   3  where q1 and q2 are two distinct
points that lie on the MSC and Σ is the covariance
matrix of the training data. Note that, under
the assumption that the data is normally distributed, the Mahalanobis
distance squared follows a χ2 distribution.

vi Feature Weights
In order to maximize
quantification performance, different weights, α, can be assigned to each feature. In order to accomplish this, a
simple optimization algorithm can be implemented in order to minimize
an error measure. In this study, the error measure used is the figure
of merit described in the following subsection. The optimization algorithm
is the Nelder–Mead simplex algorithm19,20 with weights initialized to unity, that is, beginning with no assumption
on how good features are for quantification. This is a basic algorithm
and only 20 iterations are used to find the weights so that there
is little computational overhead.

vii Dimensionality
Reduction
In this
study, principal component regression is used, that is, M0 = P from eq 2,17 and it is compared
with projecting the standard curve onto all three dimensions, i.e. Ct, Cy, and −log10(F0).

Evaluating Standard Curves
Consistent with the current
literature on evaluating standard curves, relative error (RE) and
average coefficient of variation (CV) are used to measure accuracy
and precision, respectively. The CV for each concentration is calculated
after normalizing the standard curves such that a fair comparison
across standard curves is achieved. The formula for the two measures
are given by 4  where i is
the index of a given training point, xi is the true concentration of the ith training data, and x̂i is the estimate of xi using
the standard curve. 5  where j is
the index of a given concentration and x̂j is a vector of estimated concentrations
for a given concentration indexed by j. The function
std(·) and mean(·) perform the sample standard deviation
and sample mean of their vector arguments, respectively. Borrowed
from Statistics, this paper also uses the leave-one-out cross validation
(LOOCV) error as a measure for stability and overall predictive performance.15 Stability refers to the predictive performance
when training points are removed. The equation for calculating the
LOOCV is given as 6  where N is
the number of training points, i is the index of
a given training point, zi is a vector of the true concentration for all training
points except the ith training point and ẑi is
the estimate of zi generated by the standard curve without the ith training point. In order for the optimization algorithm
for computing α to simultaneously minimize the
three aforementioned measures, it is convenient to introduce a figure
of merit, Q, to capture all of the desired properties.
Therefore, Q is defined as the product between all
three errors and can be used to heuristically used to compare the
performance across quantification methods. The average Q across all training data points is the error measure that the optimization
algorithm will minimize. 7  

Statistical
Analysis
For sample classification, outliers
were determined using a χ2 distribution with two
degrees of freedom and a statistical significance was assumed with
a p-value < 0.01. For assessing the significance
between methods in absolute quantification, p-values
were calculated using a paired, two-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test.
Statistically significant difference was considered as *p-value < 0.05, **p-value < 0.01, ***p-value < 0.001, and ****p-value <
0.0001.

Results and Discussion
In this study,
it is shown that simultaneous enhanced quantification
and multiplexing of blaOXA-48, blaNDM, blaVIM, and blaKPC β-lactamase genes in bacterial isolates
can be achieved by using multidimensional standard curves constructed
using fluorescent amplification curves in qPCR. This section is broken
into two parts: (i) target discrimination using multidimensional analysis
and (ii) enhanced quantification. First, it is proven that single-channel
multiplexing can be achieved. Once this has been established, the
framework described in Moniri et al.1 can
be applied for robust and enhanced quantification.

Target Discrimination using
Multidimensional Analysis
Given that it is nontrivial that
several targets can be multiplexed
and differentiated using only fluorescent amplification data in a
single channel, it is helpful to visualize an example. Figure 2 shows four amplification curves
and their respective derived melting curves specific for blaOXA-48, blaNDM, blaVIM, and blaKPC genes. The four curves have been chosen to have similar Ct (within 1.2 cycles). Using only this information,
that is, the conventional way of thinking, post-PCR processing such
as melting curve analysis is needed to differentiate the targets.
The same argument applies when solely observing Cy or F0. This
is an expected result given that these parameters are used for quantification
and were not intended for target identification.

Figure 2 Experimentally obtained
amplification and melting curves by single-channel
multiplex quantitative PCR for (a) blaOXA-48, (b) blaNDM, (c) blaVIM, and (d) blaKPC genes.
Extracted features (Ct, Cy, and F0) are shown on the respective plots. Each plot has been generated
by amplifying standard synthetic DNA containing the target of interest.
Background subtraction has been performed on all amplification curves
and all samples contain SYBR Green I dye.

Moniri et al.1 shows that considering
multiple features contains sufficient information gain in order to
discriminate outliers from a specific target using a MSC. However,
this raises the question: does the outlier lie on its own MSC? If
so, can we take advantage of this property and build several multidimensional
standard curves in order to discriminate multiple specific targets?

To explore this new concept, MSCs are constructed using a single
primer mix for the four target genes using Ct, Cy, and −log10(F0), as shown in Figure 3. It is visually observed that
the four standards are sufficiently distant in multidimensional space,
also termed the feature space, in order to distinguish them. That
is, an unknown DNA sample can be potentially classified as one of
the specific targets (or an outlier) solely using the extracted features
from amplification curves in a single channel.

Figure 3 Multidimensional standard
curves for detection of four carbapenemase
genes: blaOXA-48 (purple line), blaNDM (red line), blaVIM (yellow line), and blaKPC (blue line).
They were constructed using Ct, Cy, and −log10(F0) features extracted from real-time
amplification curves derived from amplifying 10-fold dilutions of
synthetic DNA. From bottom left to top right, target concentrations
range between: 108–104 copies/reaction
for blaOXA-48; 107–101 copies/reaction for blaNDM; 108–103 copies/reaction for blaVIM; and 108–103 copies/reaction
for blaKPC. Each concentration was repeated
5–8 times, and the resulting average values are projected onto
the standard curves. The computed features and curve-fitting parameters
for each MSC is presented in Table S2.

In order to demonstrate the proposed
method for multiplexing, 11
samples (bacterial isolates) given in Table 3 were tested against the multidimensional
standards. The specificity of all results was validated using a melting
curve analysis (Figure S1). As expected,
samples 1–9 provided a positive outcome whereas samples 10
and 11 (control strains) showed no amplification. The similarity measure
used to classify the unknown samples is the Mahalanobis distance using
a p-value of 0.01 as the threshold to determine if the sample is an
outlier. The results from testing can be succinctly captured within
a bar chart shown in Figure 4. There are two main observations: (i) the mean of the test
samples (bacterial isolates), which have a single resistance (samples
1–8), are correctly classified with a p-value
< 0.01; (ii) the target with multiple resistances (sample 9) is
considered as an outlier for all of the targets. Although multiple
resistances are not currently common for CPE in the U.K. (accounting
for less than 1.3% of confirmed cases),4 there is room to explore extending MSCs for other applications that
require detecting multiple targets in a single reaction. However,
this is outside the scope of this study.

Figure 4 Average Mahalanobis distance
between multidimensional standard
curves and sample test points (bacterial isolates) used for target
identification. Dots below sample ID indicate that the test sample
is classified to the standard of interest with a p-value < 0.01.

In addition to observing
the average Mahalanobis distance, it is
important to visualize the data in order to confirm that the Mahalanobis
distance is a suitable similarity measure. Figure 5 shows the Mahalanobis space for the four
standards. This visualization is constructed by projecting all data
points onto an arbitrary hyperplane orthogonal to each multidimensional
standard curve, as described in Moniri et al.1 When the training data points in the feature space are approximately
normally distributed, then the distribution of the training data points
in the Mahalanobis space is approximately circular, as seen in Figure 5. It can also be
observed that the training points (synthetic DNA) from each standard
curve are clustered together (i.e., not considered outliers) in its
respective Mahalanobis space; however, they are considered outliers
for other MSCs. This corroborates the fact that there is sufficient
information in the three chosen features to distinguish the four standard
curves.

Figure 5 Multidimensional analysis using the feature space for identification
of unknown samples. (a–d) All data points, including the replicates
for each concentration for the four MSCs (training standard points)
and nine unknown samples (test points), have been projected onto arbitrary
hyperplanes orthogonal to each MSC. (e–h) The previous plots
are magnified to visualize the location of the samples relative to
each standard of interest. The blue dots represent the data points
for each standard of interest (5–8 replicates per each concentration)
and the black circle around them corresponds to a p-value of 0.01. Samples 1–8 are correctly classified with
a p-value < 0.01, whereas sample 9 is considered
an outlier for all standards. Please see Table S3 for details on the extracted features and sigmoidal curve
fittings and Table S4 for the estimated
quantification of samples using all methods.

Enhanced Quantification
Given that multiplexing has
been established for this case study, quantification can be trivially
obtained using any conventional method such as the gold standard cycle
threshold, Ct. However, as shown in Moniri
et al.,1 enhanced quantification can be
achieved using a feature, M0, that combines
all of the features. This is enabled through weighting each feature
by optimizing an objective function and then applying a dimensionality
reduction technique in order to create a quantification curve for M0. The objective function in this study is a
figure of merit, Q, that combines accuracy, precision,
stability, and overall predictive power, as described in the Experimental Section. Figure 6 shows the average figure of merit (with
standard deviation and p-values) for each target
using the three chosen features (Ct, Cy, and −log10(F0)) and M0. Please see Figure S2 for the quantification
curves and details for the figure of merit. It can be observed from Figure 6 that quantification
using M0 performs as good, or better than
any single feature, for any of the targets. This is expected given
the nature of the multidimensional framework as M0 is constructed using a linear combination of the other
features in order to minimize the average figure of merit. It is important
to stress that any figure of merit could be selected. For blaOXA-48, blaVIM, and blaKPC, the average figure of merit
of M0 was reduced by 26.5%, 41.1%, and
12.9% compared with the best single feature, Cy, with all p-values <
0.05. Furthermore, for blaNDM, the optimization
algorithm showed that M0 converged to Ct and that the p-value between Ct and Cy was not significant. Therefore, in this case, it is acceptable
to use either Ct, Cy, or M0. However, M0 provides an automated solution for quantification
that is robust in the sense that it will always be the best performing
method.

and the error bars indicate the standard deviation. Please see Figure S2 for details.

Conclusion
There has been a long-standing goal to meet
the demand of methods
for high-level multiplexing and enhanced quantification. Any advancements
in this area would have a substantial positive impact on healthcare
and patient outcomes. Alongside these challenges, there is a growing
concern around antimicrobial resistance; the past 10 years has seen
an explosion in molecular methods and instruments for rapid screening
of drug resistant genes.21 Here, we propose
a novel method that allows for simultaneous single channel multiplexing
and enhanced quantification using existing technologies; without increase
in complexity or cost over using conventional singleplex qPCR reactions
for detecting multiple targets. This method has been validated for
the detection of four of the most prominent carbapenem-resistant genes: blaOXA-48, blaNDM, blaVIM, and blaKPC.

Methods for multiplexing and quantifying typically
involve using
fluorescent probes, melting curve analysis, agarose gels or sequencing,
all of which are time-consuming or expensive processes. In the past
few years there have been attempts to achieve simultaneous multiplexing
and quantification in a single channel. For instance, single channel
multiplexing has been achieved without melting curve analysis by altering
cycling conditions and reading fluorescence at different temperatures.22 This resulted in sufficient information gain
in order to discriminate two targets. However, this method still uses
a unidimensional approach to data analytics and increasing the number
of targets is not trivial. By extracting multiple features from existing
data, our methodology represents an opportunity to evolve existing
approaches in order to significantly increase the number of targets.

In order to implement our methodology, we require: (i) to build
multiple multidimensional standard curves. This is generally a one-time
procedure; however, MSCs may be affected by variations between experiments
(such as changing reagent batches or instruments). Therefore, as with
conventional standard curves, MSCs may have to be eventually recalibrated;
(ii) to design multiplex assays such that MSCs for each target are
sufficiently distant in the feature space. This can be achieved by
tuning reaction conditions or primer design. For example, by altering
annealing temperature, amplicon length, introducing mismatches or
primer mix concentration; and (iii) to perform data processing (such
as multifeature extraction) which is negligible given the power of
computers today.

In addition, given the nature of the multidimensional
framework,
absolute quantification is enhanced through the use of M0 by optimizing a figure of merit combining accuracy,
precision, stability and overall predictive power. The authors invite
researchers in this area to adopt M0,
as an alternative to conventional standard curves for absolute quantification,
as it guarantees improved performance by combining the benefits of
all the features it is derived from. This property results in M0 offering a robust method of quantification
in the sense that it provides the best quantification performance
across targets. Furthermore, the capabilities of MSCs extend beyond
quantification and allow for outlier detection and target identification.

Given the novelty of this work, there are many future directions
and questions that can be addressed. In this paper we have applied
the proposed method to the rapid screening of the four most prominent
carbapenemase genes in the U.K. In future studies, it would be interesting
to explore: other targets in order to develop new multiplexing panels
associated with the most significant healthcare challenges; or more
targets through incorporating additional MSCs into the feature space
and/or using multiple fluorescent channels. It is also important to
stress that the focus of this work was not on optimizing the chemistry
or data analytics for this specific set of targets. Thus, there is
room to investigate whether the chemistry and the instance of framework
can be optimized in order to maximize the separation of MSCs in the
feature space for carbapenem-resistant genes.

In conclusion,
this work has shown that is possible to simultaneously
quantify and multiplex several targets in a single channel. This is
achieved by changing the way we analyze amplification data obtained
from existing technologies. We hope that by sharing these ideas, researchers
and practitioners can implement and advance this work in order to
provide novel and affordable tools that can be easily adopted by healthcare
systems.
