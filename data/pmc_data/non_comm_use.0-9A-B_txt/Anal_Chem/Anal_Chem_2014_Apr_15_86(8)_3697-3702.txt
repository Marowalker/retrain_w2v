The methylation of cytosine to 5-methylcytosine
(5-meC) is an important
epigenetic DNA modification in many bacteria, plants, and mammals,
but its relevance for important model organisms, including Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila
melanogaster, is still equivocal. By reporting the
presence of 5-meC in a broad variety of wild, laboratory, and industrial
yeasts, a recent study also challenged the dogma about the absence
of DNA methylation in yeast species. We would like to bring to attention
that the protocol used for gas chromatography/mass spectrometry involved
hydrolysis of the DNA preparations. As this process separates cytosine
and 5-meC from the sugar phosphate backbone, this method is unable
to distinguish DNA- from RNA-derived 5-meC. We employed an alternative
LC–MS/MS protocol where by targeting 5-methyldeoxycytidine
moieties after enzymatic digestion, only 5-meC specifically derived
from DNA is quantified. This technique unambiguously identified cytosine
DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana (14.0% of cytosines methylated), Mus musculus (7.6%), and Escherichia coli (2.3%).
Despite achieving a detection limit at 250 attomoles (corresponding
to <0.00002 methylated cytosines per nonmethylated cytosine), we
could not confirm any cytosine DNA methylation in laboratory and industrial
strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Saccharomyces boulardii, Saccharomyces
paradoxus, or Pichia pastoris. The protocol however unequivocally confirmed DNA methylation in
adult Drosophila melanogaster at a
value (0.034%) that is up to 2 orders of magnitude below the detection
limit of bisulphite sequencing. Thus, 5-meC is a rare DNA modification
in drosophila but absent in yeast.

==== Body
A covalently modified DNA base,
5-methylcytosine (5-meC), is widely found in bacteria, plants, and
mammalian cells and is associated with the epigenetic regulation of
gene expression.1 However, this DNA modification
is not ubiquitous. 5-meC is thought to be absent in the DNA of many
species, including popular laboratory model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans.2 Other organisms might possess low amounts of cytosine DNA methylation,
including Neurospara crassa,3Dictyostelium discoidium,4Schistosoma mansoni,5 and Drosophila melanogaster,6 for some of which DNA methylation was
initially thought to be absent. In several of these cases, the content
of DNA methylation is at the edge of the detection limit of bisulphite
sequencing approaches, currently the dominating technique for analysis
of DNA methylation. Despite that bisulphite sequencing gives highly
valuable information about the sequence context of methylated cytosine,
it has limitations at the lower concentration range: incomplete bisulphite
conversion of unmethylated cytosines and missalignment of sequencing
reads in the mapping process in repetitive, telomeric, and GC-rich
regions result in false positive rates of ∼0.5% and higher.7−10 For this reason, the existence and biological function of low methylation
levels is still ambiguous and/or debated in some species.

Until
recently, also DNA of budding yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae has been considered to be free of 5-methylcytosine.
Despite this modification had been described in the first studies
that date back to the late 1970’s;11 later studies did not confirm DNA methylation of S. cerevisiae. Yeast DNA is not cut by methylation-dependent
restriction endonucleases, and 5-meC was not found in DNA digests
analyzed by HPLC/UV–VIS where a detection limit of 1 per 3100
to 6000 residues was achieved.12 Recently
however, Tang et al. challenged this result. With the use of a GC–MS
method, a much lower detection limit (6.4 fmol) compared to the HPLC
protocols was achieved. This protocol detected 5-meC in DNA extracts
of three budding yeast laboratory strains.13 Moreover, this study reported DNA methylation in several other yeast
species as well, which included the medically important tropical yeast Saccharomyces boulardii and the popular laboratory
model fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). Indeed, the evidence for DNA methylation is debated in the latter
species. In difference to S. cerevisiae, S. pombe possesses a cytosine methyltransferase
homologue of the DNMT2 family, termed Pombe MethylTransferase 1 (Pmt1).14 Pmt1, however, appears to be specific for tRNA
modification.15 The 5-meC contents reported
by Tang et al. ranged from 0.036% for S. boulardii to 0.205% for S. pombe. For S. cerevisiae strains, values from 0.085% (strain
W1588-4C) to 0.128% in the common laboratory yeast strain BY4741,
a derivative of S288c, the parent of the yeast genome project,16 were reported. These results appeared paradigm-shifting,
implying that a huge variety of yeast species, including S. cerevisiae, are capable of cytosine DNA methylation
and would indicate that these important model organisms could be employed
to analyze the function of low-level DNA methylation.

These
conclusions are challenged by the application of an improved
technique. Employing a liquid chromatography selective reaction monitoring
(LC-SRM) method that is insensitive to contamination with RNA-derived
methylcytosine, we achieve a detection limit of 250 attomoles for
methylcytidine (around 25 times more sensitive compared to the previous
study13). We detect no cytosine DNA methylation
in the different yeast species S. cerevisiae, S. boulardii, S.
paradoxus, S. pombe, and P. pastoris. In contrast, the
protocol unambiguously detected and accurately quantified DNA methylation
in Mus musculus, Arabidopsis
thaliana, Escherichia coli, and at a low but significant level in Drosophila
melanogaster.

Results and Discussion
Similar to
a variety of common LC and LC–MS protocols for
the detection of 5-methylcytosine,13,17,18 Tang et al. analyzed the 5-meC content in yeast DNA
upon hydrolysis. This procedure separates base and sugar phosphate
and quantifies eventually the (free) methylated and unmethylated cytosine.13,17,18 Applying a similar approach that
is based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS),17 we obtained 5-meC concentration values for S. cerevisiae DNA fully comparable to those reported
by Tang et al. (data not shown), confirming the precision of the GC–MS
technology. Surprisingly, however, this method revealed significant
5-meC content also in negative control DNA purified from the E. coli strain GM2929 (Marinus, CGSC no: 7080). This
was unexpected, as this E. coli strain
is deficient in bacterial DNA methyltransferases, including the dcm-6 allele and is used in laboratories around the world
to produce nonmethylated DNA for cloning experiments.19,20 In the search for a potential source of the methylated cytosine
in GM2929 DNA preparations, we considered copurified methylcytosine
derived from RNA as its potential source. Cytosine methylation has
been found as an abundant modification on different RNA species, especially
on rRNA in prokaryotes and tRNA in eukaryotes.21−23 In order to
setup a quantification method that restricts the detection of 5-meC
to DNA-derived nucleosides, we used a protocol based on enzymatic
release of nucleosides using the enzyme DNA Degradase Plus (ZymoResearch).24 The enzymatic digest
preserves the base coupled to the deoxyribose (nucleoside, Figure 1a). This enables the separation of the DNA-derived
deoxycytidine and the RNA derived (hydroxyl)-cytidine by mass spectrometry
due to significant mass difference. Samples processed in this manner
were analyzed using a state of the art HPLC (Agilent 1290 Infinity)
coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent 6460), set
to quantify deoxyribose-cytosine (Figure 1b,
upper panel) and deoxyribose-5-methylcytosine (5-methylcytidine, Figure 1b, middle panel).

(S. cerevisiae BY4741 and S. pombe 972h-). The chromatographic peak represents

concentration limit excludes significant matrix effects on quantification
and LOD. (C) Methylation levels in genomic DNA purified from six different
species. The number of 5me-deoxycytidine is expressed as percentage
of unmodified deoxycytidine for each species (n =
3 from biological triplicates, error bars = ± SD); n.d. = not
detected.

This DNA specific method unambiguously
detected deoxycytidine and
5-methyldeoxycytidine in purified standards over a concentration range
of 3 orders of magnitude. 5-Methyldeoxycytidine and deoxycytidine
were quantified by external calibration within the dynamic range of
the analytical method (R2 = 0.9999 and R2 = 0.9965, respectively, Figure 1b). A limit of detection at 250 attomol per injection for
5-meC was obtained (Figure 1b, left inset).
The absence of an inferring matrix effect of the DNA digest sample
was confirmed by reproducing the limit of detection and linear range
by standard addition of 5-meC to a fully processed sample of S. cerevisiae DNA (Figure 1b, right inset). This method clearly detected and quantified 5-meC
in DNA samples of A. thaliana leaves
(14.0% of deoxycytidines methylated), mouse liver (7.6%), and methylation
competent E. coli K12 cells (strain
DH5alpha 2.3%), confirming DNA methylation as expected (Figure 1, panels b and c). Taking into account the genome
size and GC content, these values allowed an estimation about the
number of methylated cytosine residues per genome (A. thaliana, 6 × 106; M. musculus, 9 × 107; E. coli, 5 × 104) (Table 1). Moreover, this protocol confirmed the expected
decline in methylation in the DNA methyltransferases deficient (dcm-6) K12 derivate GM2929 (Figure 1b, Table 1). Compared to the methylation competent
K12 strain DH5α, the content of methylated cytosines was reduced
to 0.016% (equaling <500 modified cytosine bases per genome), which
corresponds to a reduction in DNA methylation of 99.3%.

Whereas, unmethylated cytidines were readily detected in all yeast
species (Figure 1b, upper panel), the protocol
applied on S. cerevisiae, S. boulardii, S. paradoxus, P. pastoris, and S. pombe DNA did not detect any evidence for the
content of 5-methyldeoxycytidine (Figure 1b,
lower panel; Table 1). Taking into account
the limit of detection at 250 attomol for methyldeoxycytidine, its
content in yeast would be lower than 0.00002 per deoxycytidine (Table 1). Considering the importance of budding yeast in
basic research and industry, the analysis was conducted on five different S. cerevisiae yeasts. These included the laboratory
strains BY4741 (in its prototrophic version, BY4741-pHLUM25), which had yielded the highest S. cerevisiae 5-meC content in the study by Tang
et al.13 and the strain D273–10B
that was used in the seminal study that claimed for the first time
the absence of DNA methylation in S. cerevisiae.12 The measurements were conducted on
DNA purified both from cells grown to stationary and exponential phase.
Under both conditions DNA methylation remained undetectable. In addition,
the absence of methylation was confirmed in industrial yeast. Analysis
of the vine production strain AWRI 796, the lager/pilsner beer production
yeast Saflager W-34/70, and the baking “dry-yeast” SCHD0308
(Ruf, Germany) revealed no evidence for DNA methylation either (Table 1).

The results obtained in budding yeast were
representative for other
yeast species. We measured DNA samples obtained from S. boulardii, a tropical yeast of medicinal use isolated
from lychee and mangosteen fruit in 1923, S. paradoxus, a yeast species living on the bark of deciduous trees, the common
laboratory models fission yeast S. pombe, and the methylotrophic yeast commonly used in protein production, P. pastoris. DNA methylation was not detected in
any of these yeast species either (Table 1).

Finally, we applied this protocol to DNA obtained from D. melanogaster DNA. The fruit fly is a common model
organism, but the role and existence of its DNA methylation is the
subject of an ongoing debate.6,26,27 We could clearly and unambiguously detect Drosophila cytosine DNA methylation (Figure 1b). Revealing
0.034% of cytosines methylated, the total number of methylcytosine
in the Drosophila genome is thus estimated to be in the range of 2
× 104 modified bases per genome (Table 1). This result thus confirms methylation in drosophila, reveals
however a lower content as compared to estimations obtained with previous
methods.6 The total content of methylated
cytosines in Drosophila is thus comparable
to those in the E. coli genome, albeit
the latter genome is substantially smaller (Table 1). This value is several orders of magnitude above the detection
limit of the LC–MS/MS method (Figure 1). It is however 10–100 fold below the error rate/detection
limit of bisulphite sequencing. Bisulphite sequencing, at least in
its current implementations, is thus not applicable for the analysis
of Drosophila DNA methylation.

Conclusions
An LC-SRM method specific to DNA-derived nucleosides was used to
assess cytosine DNA methylation in different model organisms. A detection
limit of 250 attomoles for methyl-deoxycytidine, which corresponded
to one modified base per 50000 deoxycytidines, was achieved. As expected,
cytosine DNA methylation was detected and could be precisely quantified
in A. thaliana, M. musculus, and E. coli DNA. Substantially lower,
but unequivocal, evidence for DNA methylation was obtained in D. melanogaster DNA. However, DNA methylation was
not detected in laboratory and industrial strains of S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, S. boulardii, S.
paradoxus, and P. pastoris. In summary, these results reveal that methylcytosine quantification
methods that
are based on hydrolytic DNA cleavage are sensitive to copurification
artifacts. Moreover, species such as Drosophila contain quantities of DNA methylation too low to be measured by
bilsulphite sequencing. Importantly however, this study demonstrates
that while a low amount of DNA methylation is detectable in D. melanogaster, yeast species do not possess cytosine
DNA methylation.

were grown as triplicates starting from a single colony each in 50
mL LB and incubated at 37 °C, 200 rpm until stationary growth
phase. The number of bacterial and yeast cells were estimated on a
CASY TT (Roche) cell counter. Yeast and bacterial cell pellets were
centrifuged at 5000g for 3 min and washed with water
before storage at −80 °C.

DNA Extraction
A. thaliana DNA was extracted from
100 mg leaf tissue of Columbia 0 plants grown
on a long day (16 h light, 8 h dark) for 3–4 weeks using a
Plant Genomic DNA Miniprep Kit (GenElute G2N70–1KT). M. musculus DNA was extracted from 15 mg of liver
tissue obtained from female mice of mixed C57BL/6/SV/129 background
using the Genomic-tip 20/G kit (Qiagen). D. melanogaster DNA was extracted from a mixed population of 10 female and 10 male
wt/w118 adult flies using a Gentra Puregene DNA purification kit (Qiagen).
Yeast and bacterial DNA were extracted from 1.5 × 109 or 4.5 × 109 cells, respectively, using the Genomic-tip
20/G kit (Qiagen). DNA extracts were treated with RNase A at 37 °C
for 45 min and DNA purification was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Purified DNA was precipitated with isopropanol and washed
with 70% ethanol and resuspended in 10 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0. DNA
was quantified using dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Qubit) and quality controlled
by gel electrophoresis.

Sample Preparation for LC–MS/MS
DNA samples
were treated with DNA Degradase Plus (ZymoResearch, E2021) to obtain
individual nucleosides. One microgram DNA was treated with 5U Degradase
at 37 °C for 1 h, in a final volume of 25 μL and subsequently
inactivated by adding 175 μL of 0.1% formic acid. The nucleobase
standard solutions were prepared at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL
in 50% methanol and mixed to obtain a standard mix with the following
concentration: C, 800 ng/mL; 5mC, 8 ng/mL; dC, 80 μg/mL; and
5mdC, 80 ng/mL. Sixteen 1:2 serial dilutions were prepared for the
external calibration curves. For the evaluation of a potential matrix
effect on the calibration of the 5mdC, five 1:3 serial dilutions from
a 5 ng/mL stock solution were prepared and 0.25 μL spiked in
25 μL of BY4741-pHLUM DNA digest.

Twenty microliters of
the samples, diluted to contain approximately 100 ng of digested DNA,
were injected onto a reverse phase ultraperformance liquid chromatography
(UPLC) column (ZORBAX RRHD Eclipse Plus C18, 2.1 × 50 mm, 1.8
μm particle size, Agilent) using a 6 min isocratic run [water:methanol:formic
acid (95:5:0.1) (100 μL/min)]. The eluent was directed to an
electrospray ion source connected to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer
(Agilent 6460 QQQ), operating in positive mode. The following transitions
were monitored for C m/z 244.1→112.0,
5mC m/z 258.2→126.1, dC m/z 228.1→112.0, and 5mdC m/z 242.1→126.1. Peak areas were
extracted and integrated using MassHunter.
