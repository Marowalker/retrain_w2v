We
demonstrate the feasibility of microscale molecular imaging
using hyperpolarized proton and carbon-13 MRI contrast media and low-field
(47.5 mT) preclinical scale (38 mm i.d.) 2D magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI). Hyperpolarized proton images with 94 × 94 μm2 spatial resolution and hyperpolarized carbon-13 images with
250 × 250 μm2 in-plane spatial resolution were
recorded in 4–8 s (largely limited by the electronics response),
surpassing the in-plane spatial resolution (i.e., pixel size) achievable
with micro-positron emission tomography (PET). These hyperpolarized
proton and 13C images were recorded using large imaging
matrices of up to 256 × 256 pixels and relatively large fields
of view of up to 6.4 × 6.4 cm2. 13C images
were recorded using hyperpolarized 1-13C-succinate-d2 (30 mM in water, %P13C = 25.8 ± 5.1% (when produced) and %P13C = 14.2 ± 0.7% (when imaged), T1 = 74 ± 3 s), and proton images were recorded using 1H hyperpolarized pyridine (100 mM in methanol-d4, %PH = 0.1 ± 0.02% (when
imaged), T1 = 11 ± 0.1 s). Both contrast
agents were hyperpolarized using parahydrogen (>90% para-fraction)
in an automated 5.75 mT parahydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) hyperpolarizer.
A magnetized path was demonstrated for successful transportation of
a 13C hyperpolarized contrast agent (1-13C-succinate-d2, sensitive to fast depolarization when at
the Earth’s magnetic field) from the PHIP polarizer to the
47.5 mT low-field MRI. While future polarizing and low-field MRI hardware
and imaging sequence developments can further improve the low-field
detection sensitivity, the current results demonstrate that microscale
molecular imaging in vivo is already feasible at
low (<50 mT) fields and potentially at low (∼1 mM) metabolite
concentrations.

==== Body
Molecular
imaging1 differs from traditional medical
imaging modalities
by utilizing probes known as biomarkers to image particular biochemical
targets or metabolic pathways. These molecular imaging probes typically
require use of radioactive nuclei, e.g., 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose
for positron emission tomography (PET),2 or chemical modification of the tracer molecules, e.g., fluorescent
contrast media.3 In comparison, hyperpolarized
magnetic resonance imaging (HP MRI) contrast media are uniquely free
from the above shortcomings because nonradioactive nuclei such as 13C in naturally occurring metabolites are being traced. Moreover,
the signatures of injected HP MRI contrast agents and their metabolites
can be spectrally differentiated to yield additional molecular information,4 an advantage that has already been exploited
in clinical trials for prostate cancer.5 Hyperpolarization4,6,7 is
a key step in the preparation of these agents; generally, conventional
magnetic resonance (MR) methods are otherwise not sensitive enough
to track and image such molecules in vivo because
of low concentrations and as a consequence of the miniscule equilibrium
nuclear spin polarization (P ≤ 10–5). Although fundamentally transient in nature, HP spin states can
be prepared by increasing the nuclear spin polarization to nearly
100% in some cases, directly translating to orders-of-magnitude enhancement
of MR sensitivity. To date, near-unity levels of polarization have
been achieved for several nuclei. For example, spin exchange optical
pumping (SEOP) has produced P129Xe values
as high as ∼0.9 for Xe gas.8 Similarly,
values as high as PH = 0.9 for protons
and P13C = 0.7 for carbon9 have been achieved by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization
(DNP). Alternatively, the chemically based hyperpolarization techniques
such as parahydrogen induced polarization (PHIP)10 and signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE)11 utilize the pure spin order of the singlet state
of protons in parahydrogen as the polarization source.12

When slowly relaxing nuclear spins with
spin–lattice relaxation
time (T1) of tens of seconds are hyperpolarized
in biologically relevant molecules (e.g., 13C-pyruvate),
they can be successfully used to image cellular metabolism in living
organisms4,5 to act as HP contrast agents (HCAs) enabling
true molecular imaging.13 HP agents have
already served as useful probes for reporting on metabolic changes
in several deadly diseases14 including
cancer,15 where the agents fulfill the
role of imaging biomarkers.4 Moreover,
these agents can noninvasively report on early response to treatment16 and enable disease grading.17

While HCA technology provides clear benefits of rich
molecular
information content, this emerging advanced imaging modality engenders
additional complexity and costs. Normally a relatively expensive “hyperpolarizer”
for on-site HCA production18 is required,
which must be situated in close proximity to a high-field MRI scanner
equipped with multinuclear capability. For example, the leading HCA
technology, dissolution-DNP, is being tested on a 3 T MRI platform.5 Combined with the relatively low throughput rate
of patient examination of high-field MRI (≥1.5 T), HCA technology
in its present state is likely to carry a high molecular imaging examination
cost similar to that of PET imaging. In addition to the expected financial
burden to first-world economies, such a trend would likely render
this technology unavailable to patient populations in poorer countries
comprising most of the world’s population.

However, HCA
technology offers one more significant technological
advantage that has largely remained untapped: the induced nuclear
spin hyperpolarization is independent of the MRI scanner’s
magnetic field. We have recently provided a theoretical basis with
experimental evidence that low-field MRI can be more sensitive than
high-field MRI for HP detection. This was achieved through the introduction
of resonance frequency-optimized MRI radio-frequency (rf) coils that
mitigate unfavorable scaling of sensitivity with frequency.19 Low-field MRI (≤0.05 T) enjoys several
advantages over high field. It is significantly less expensive due
to reduced magnet costs. It is also a significantly higher examination
throughput technique, because no time for patient-tailored scanner
preparation (i.e., B0 and B1 field shimming) is needed. Furthermore, it has also
been recently shown that patient rf power deposition is negligible
at such low operating frequencies20 making
it a significantly safer imaging modality.

Here, the feasibility
of low-field molecular imaging with a very
high spatial resolution (94 × 94 μm2) is demonstrated
at 47.5 mT for 1H and 13C detection of HCA with 1H HP pyridine and 13C HP 1-13C-succinate-d2. The HCAs were prepared using the parahydrogen-based
hyperpolarization techniques of SABRE and PHIP, respectively. These
techniques are not instrumentation-demanding and offer high-throughput
production of HP contrast media and thus have the potential to enable
low-cost production of HCAs for clinical imaging. When combined with
low-field MRI, such HCA production methods should ultimately enable
a high-throughput molecular-imaging platform for clinical use at a
relatively low cost.

Results
Hyperpolarization of Contrast
Agents in PHIP Polarizer
Pyridine (Py) protons were hyperpolarized
to %PH = 0.1 ± 0.02% (average polarization
per each proton
(five in total) corresponding to an enhancement factor ε ≈
5000 at 47.5 mT), which was confirmed spectroscopically at 47.5 mT
using a reference NMR signal from thermally polarized water in accordance
with the referencing scheme previously reported.8,21 Using
the experimentally determined T1 of 11.1
± 0.1 s at 47.5 mT (average T1 for
all HP protons of Py) and an estimated 12 s delivery time from the
PHIP polarizer to the low-field MRI scanner, it was concluded that
the initial Py hyperpolarization achieved at 5.75 mT was ∼0.3
± 0.06% (per each proton). 1-13C-Succinate-d2 was hyperpolarized to %P13C = 25.8 ± 5.1% (30 mM substrate injected into 7 atm
of para-H2 during 5 s reaction time at 73 °C) as measured in situ by the 5.75 mT PHIP polarizer using a 30° excitation
rf pulse. This in situ13C detection allowed
for quality assurance of the HCA prior to delivery to the low-field
MRI system. The 30° rf pulse consumed ∼13% of the 13C magnetization while leaving the remaining 87% (i.e., %P13C = 22.4 ± 4.4%) available for further
use.

“HyperBridge” and “HyperGate” Use
for Hyperpolarized 13C-Succinate-d2
While transfer of HP agents has been recently demonstrated22,23 using a magnetic pathway, such work was conducted at 0.8 T using
a significantly more sophisticated rigid structure. In this work,
a two-piece magnetic pathway with mT fields was developed. The first
device used here, dubbed the “HyperBridge”, consisted
of a series of one-sided flexible magnetized strips (∼0.5 in.
wide, Figure 1) assembled into a single flexible
line. The 1/8 in. o.d. (1/16 in. i.d.) tubing attached to this flexible line is used for transferring
the HP solution while a static magnetic field of ∼14–50
mT is maintained. A second device, dubbed the “HyperGate”,
was used to generate a 4–6 mT magnetic field over ∼1
ft3 at the entrance of the low-field MRI magnet. While
some HCAs such as HP 2-hydroxyethyl 1-13C-propionate (HEP)
can be exposed to nearly zero magnetic field without substantial loss
of polarization, other HCAs clearly require hyperpolarization protection
by a sufficient static magnetic field during the transfer from hyperpolarizer
to the MRI scanner.22,23 Thus, the HyperBridge and HyperGate
were not used with HP Py but were required for HP 1-13C-succinate-d2.

of the HyperBridge; the HyperBridge and HyperGate are fully described

the transfer and in the MRI scanner (with a 15° rf pulse) after
the transfer. (C) 3D-rendering of the experimental setup. (D, E) Close-up
of the HyperBridge.

The combined efficacy
of the HyperBridge and HyperGate was tested
by 13C hyperpolarization detection before and after HCA
transfer between the PHIP polarizer and the MRI scanner. The 13C T1 of 1-13C-succinate-d2 in aqueous solution was 74 ± 3 s and
75 ± 3 s at 5.75 mT and 47.5 mT, respectively. Although the HCA
passes through variable magnetic fields in the range of ∼4–50
mT, a single value of T1 = 75 s was used
to estimate T1 hyperpolarization losses
based on the above results at 5.75 mT and 47.5 mT. In one experiment,
%P13C = 25.8 ± 5.1% was produced
in the PHIP polarizer. This sample was delivered via HyperBridge and
HyperGate into the MRI scanner over a 22 ± 2 s period, wherein
the total losses (from T1 decay and application
of the sampling rf pulse in the PHIP polarizer) should diminish the 13C hyperpolarization by a factor of 1.54 to yield an estimated
%P13C value of 16.7 ± 3.3% (in the
MRI scanner), Figure 1A. Indeed, %P13C = 14.2 ± 0.7% was measured experimentally, corresponding
to an enhancement factor ε ≈ 3 500 000 at 47.5 mT, which
indicated that primary losses were largely due to T1 relaxation and rf excitation. A control experiment performed
with a similar 13C hyperpolarization level but without
the HyperGate yielded a 13C hyperpolarization of <1%
at 47.5 mT (Figure 1B), demonstrating a significant
loss of hyperpolarization and the efficacy of the HyperBridge and
HyperGate.

2D Low-Field MRI of HCAs
HP proton
images of Py in
methanol-d4 in 10 mm NMR tubes collected
in the transverse and sagittal imaging planes (corresponding to two
views of the 10 mm NMR tube filled with ∼2 mL of HP Py solution
and 1/16 in. o.d. PTFE tubing) are shown in
Figures 2 and 3, respectively,
at three different in-plane spatial resolutions. It should be noted
that a 2D projection (i.e., without slice selection) gradient echo
(GRE) sequence was used. This imaging sequence defined only pixel
size (2D) with the most intense pixels lying in regions of greatest
sample thickness but did not define the voxel size (3D). However,
investigation of the resolution and sensitivity limits of potential in vivo HP low-field MRI motivated this study. Therefore,
the voxel volume, Vvox, of the most intense
pixels used to ascertain these limits was defined as the product of
in-plane pixel resolution (as defined by the imaging sequence parameters)
and the sample thickness at the location of the most intense pixel.
This measure yielded the volumetric spatial resolution (in units of
μm3 or alternatively in mm3), and in conjunction
with the defined voxel’s associated measured signal-to-noise-ratio
(SNR), SNRMAX, was used for detection sensitivity analysis.

using only a fraction of k-space encodings (50% and 33%, respectively).

Four sets of 1H images (Figures 2 and 3) were acquired from individual
hyperpolarization
preparations and yielded the following voxel sizes and SNRs for sensitivity
analysis: 375 × 375 × 32 000 μm3 (Vvox = 4.5 mm3, SNRMAX = 187, Figure 2D), 94 × 94
× 32 000 μm3 (Vvox = 0.28 mm3, SNRMAX = 24, Figure 2F), 375 × 375 × 8750 μm3 (Vvox = 1.2 mm3, SNRMAX = 56, Figure 3A), and 188 ×
188 × 8750 μm3 (Vvox = 0.31 mm3, SNRMAX = 36, Figure 3C). The 1/16 in. PTFE tubing used for
bubbling parahydrogen is clearly resolved in all four MR images. The
10 mm NMR tube was not placed perfectly coaxial with the imaging system’s z-axis, resulting in the observed tilt in the images.

Low-field HP 13C images of 1-13C-succinate-d2 in water are shown in Figure 4. HP solutions were loaded into tilted 15 mL Falcon tubes
and imaged in the coronal and sagittal planes (corresponding to two
orientations of the Falcon tubes filled with ∼1.5 mL of HP
1-13C-succinate-d2 solution
and foam) with an in-plane spatial resolution of 250 × 250 μm2. These two images were acquired from individual hyperpolarization
preparations and corresponded to the following voxel sizes of ∼250
× 250 × 3000 μm3 (Vvox = 0.19 mm3, SNRMAX = 58, Figure 4C) and ∼250 × 250 × 8000 μm3 (Vvox = 0.50 mm3,
SNRMAX = 72, Figure 4D). The brown
arrows shown in Figure 4 indicate the presence
of foamed contrast agent, a consequence of high-pressure ejection
from the polarizer and HCA surface tension. Despite the magnetic susceptibility
artifacts that typically accompany bubbles at high field, the foamed
agent was amenable to imaging at the low field of 47.5 mT used here.
The images in Figures 2F and 3C show differential-mode gradient amplifier noise, which a
low-pass gradient filter would reduce or eliminate.

Under-sampling (i.e., data recording with 16–50%
of the
imaging matrix’s corresponding frequency-domain k-space points) did not cause any significant imaging artifacts (albeit
some blurring is visible as in Figure 4) resulting
from loss of information. The coherent k-space under-sampling
scheme for each MRI acquisition was conducted using the built-in algorithm
and routine of the Prospa software environment (v3.12, Magritek, Wellington,
New Zealand). Given the nonequilibrium nature of hyperpolarization,
under-sampling k-space importantly decreases the
total imaging acquisition time. For example, collecting only 50% of k-space projections accelerates acquisition by a factor
of 2. The % of k-space sampled is therefore reported
in Figures 2–4. Additional details about Prospa’s under-sampling scheme
can be found in the Supporting Information. Fast scan speeds are especially desirable for contrast agents with
rapidly decaying polarization due to low T1, as exemplified by the agents used here. The MR images presented
in Figures 2–4 and the Supporting Information were automatically
reconstructed from the under-sampled data by Prospa as supplied by
the manufacturer. No additional data or image manipulations were performed
to improve image quality, such as zero-filling or smoothing, beyond
that as acquired and shown here and in the Supporting
Information.

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge
(e.g., refs (24−30)), the results shown here compare favorably with other low-field
images of hyperpolarized or nonhyperpolarized media from the perspectives
of both the achieved in-plane resolution as well as the small effective
voxel sizes. Low-field, frequency-optimized rf coils comparable in
SNR performance to commercial preclinical coils at 4.7 T for hyperpolarized
contrast agents19 were used to achieve
the high sensitivity necessary for microscale spatial resolution of 1H and 13C HP MRI at low magnetic field. Figures 2–4 show that the required
sensitivity is indeed attainable at a magnetic field strength of 47.5
mT. Not only the presented HP 1H images but also the relatively
large FOV 13C HP images are high-resolution owing to a
large imaging matrix size (256 × 256 points) allowing small pixel
sizes of only 250 × 250 μm2 or less.

HyperBridge
and HyperGate
These devices were essential
for efficient preservation of nuclear spin hyperpolarization of 1-13C-succinate-d2 (susceptible to
depolarization in a near zero magnetic field) during transportation
from the PHIP hyperpolarizer to the low-field MRI scanner. Overall,
our experience is similar to others working with similar contrast
agents.22,23 The range of magnetic field variation along
the transfer path was almost entirely within the magnetic field bounds
defined by the T1 measurements at 5.75
mT and 47.5 mT. The HyperBridge and HyperGate may also prove useful
for other similar HCAs such as 1-13C-phospholactate.31

Detection Sensitivity and Other Limits of
Detection
The presented imaging results allow estimation
of the corresponding
detection sensitivity. Since HCA media can utilize variable % polarization
and concentration or may involve detection of nuclei other than spin-1/2
nuclei (i.e., 1H, 13C, 129Xe, etc.),
we were prompted to implement a new quantity of measure incorporating
these variables as described below.

SNR in MRI19,32,33 is proportional to the gyromagnetic
ratio, γ, concentration, C, and nuclear spin
polarization, P, in a voxel volume, VVOX, or 1  where A is a numerical constant
accounting for rf coil sensitivity, the imaging pulse sequence efficiency,
and other experimental parameters. The value of this constant A yields a useful quantification of the detection sensitivity
of the molecular imaging method because it can be used for direct
comparison of imaging approaches and protocols. For example, 2  Here, we introduce the concept of fully (P = 1 = 100%) polarized proton spins (pps), wherein AHγH in eq 2 is a useful quantity derived from the SNR from a hypothetical 1
mol of fully polarized proton spins (pps) in the imaging voxel of
interest. When using the experimental results from Figure 3C (CH = 0.5 M (5 Py
protons at 0.1 M concentration) in 0.31 mm3 voxel volume
with 0.1% polarization), AHγH = 2.3 × 1011 units of SNR per 1 mol of pps.
The utility of this experimental rf-coil parameter lies in its enabling
prediction of the SNR of biomedical imaging experiments with known
metabolic fluxes, HCA concentrations, and anticipated % polarization
on target hyperpolarized molecule.

For example, when using the
low-field imaging setup (Figure 1) demonstrated
in Figure 3C, if 1 mM concentration of proton
spins with PH = 0.01 (1%) is achieved
in a tissue with an imaging voxel
size of 10 mm3, one should expect a SNR of 23. A SNR value
>20 is sufficient for MRI image reconstruction as well as for quantitative in vivo imaging analysis of metabolite concentrations.34 Moreover, this expected fine spatial resolution
(i.e., voxel size of ∼10 mm3) is similar to or better
than that of high-field spectroscopic HP MRI performed with HCA with
a significantly (factor of 10+) greater payload of net magnetization
(i.e., CVVOXP, eq 1)16 and represents
nearly an order of magnitude improvement over the 50–100 mm3 voxel sizes of conventional high-field preclinical MR spectroscopy
enabled by signal averaging of hundreds of scans.35 A voxel size of ∼10 mm3 already enables
molecular imaging of deadly diseases such as cancer with isotropic
spatial resolution of 2–3 mm, which can be further improved
(to 1–2 mm range) through the use of more polarized media (e.g., P = 0.2 vs P = 0.01) or by exploiting metabolic
pathways with higher metabolic fluxes and in vivo concentration (e.g., C = 10 mM vs 1 mM). Thus,
the imaging sensitivity of HP low-field MRI certainly paves the way
to molecular imaging of many metabolic pathways such as glycolysis13,16 or glutamine36 and choline37,38 metabolism, which are often up-regulated in cancer and other diseases,
with spatial resolution (defined as the pixel size) exceeding that
of micro-PET (>2 mm in each dimension).39

It should also be stressed that the effective spectroscopic
line-width
corresponding to B0 field homogeneity
is typically limited only by the homogeneity of the magnet at low
magnetic fields (our study) rather than by subject-induced perturbations
to B0 (i.e., inhomogeneity due to tissue
magnetic susceptibility) at high magnetic fields. In addition, subject-associated
rf (also referred to as B1) losses are
negligible at low resonance frequencies.20 Therefore, the SNR factor analysis performed above is fully applicable
to in vivo conditions.

A corresponding analysis
applies to 13C imaging. When
using the experimental parameters in Figure 4C (C = 0.030 M, %P = 14.2%, VVOX = 0.19 mm3, SNR = 54), A13Cγ13C = 6.7 × 1010 units of SNR per 1 mol of 13C polarized spins
(cps, i.e., 100% polarized 13C nuclei). It should be noted
that γ13C = γH/3.98, and consequently
it is unsurprising that A13Cγ13C in units of cps is significantly lower than AHγH. It reflects the inherently greater
NMR sensitivity of protons with their greater magnetic moment under
otherwise identical conditions compared to those of 13C
spins. However, A13Cγ13C of the 13C rf coil can be expressed in units of pps (corresponding
to HP proton imaging in the 13C rf coil at 3.98 times lower B0) yielding A13CγH = 2.7 × 1011 units of SNR per
1 mol of pps. This value of A13CγH is very similar to AHγH despite an ∼4-fold difference in the resonance frequency
(0.508 MHz vs 2.02 MHz). This agreement is consistent with our recent
work demonstrating a very weak MR SNR dependence on the resonance
frequency (SNR ∝ ω00.25) for this
type of MRI rf coil.19 Moreover, this result
indicates that high-resolution and high-sensitivity (i.e., large Aγ values) MRI of HCA should be readily achieved at
even lower magnetic fields. Although future hardware and imaging-sequence
improvements can certainly improve Aγ, low-field
MRI still largely remains unexplored territory, the values already
reported here demonstrate the feasibility of in vivo preclinical imaging using HCAs.

Feasibility of Direct Proton
HCA Imaging in Vivo
While protons are the
most sensitive MRI nuclei, the direct
proton imaging of HP MRI contrast media is challenging at high magnetic
fields because of background signal from ∼102 M
protons.40 A potential mitigation is indirect
proton imaging of 13C HCA by initial water suppression,
followed by intramolecular polarization transfer from HP 13C to 1H, with final imaging of proton spins.41,42 While this approach has been demonstrated at high field, it poses
two challenges: (i) efficient water background suppression and (ii)
the requirement of 13C isotopic labeling. Fundamentally,
for direct proton HCA imaging, the condition CHCA × PHCA ≫ CB × PB (or CHCA ≫ CB × PB/PHCA) must be
met (where CHCA, CB, PHCA, and PB correspond to the concentrations and polarizations of
HCA and the background proton species, respectively). The low B0 magnetic field used here reduces proton background
by orders of magnitude, reduction of B0 linearly decreases PB. Reasonably assuming
that %PHCA = 10%, corresponding to an
enhancement factor of 6 × 105 (i.e., PHCA/PB) at 47.5 mT and water
proton concentration of ∼102 M, CHCA during image acquisition must be significantly greater
than 0.2 mM, which makes direct proton imaging of many HP metabolites
above the 1 mM level feasible. Moreover, further minimization of the
ratio CB × PB/PHCA simply entails additional
reduction of B0.

Low-Field MRI Hardware
Challenges and Opportunities
A key metric of MRI rf coil
performance is the quality factor Q (ω0/Δω0) of the
rf receiver network, where Δω0 corresponds
to the −3 dB bandwidth of the matched rf circuit resonance
at the detection frequency ω0. The use of high-sensitivity
coils implies a high Q, which limits the maximum
spectroscopic imaging bandwidth (SW). High SW is required for high-resolution
MRI with large imaging matrices, because Δω0 must be greater than SW to avoid imaging artifacts.43 The rf circuits used here had Q values
of 62 at 2.02 MHz and 28 at 0.508 MHz corresponding to Δω0 of 32 kHz and 18 kHz, respectively. Therefore, nearly the
maximum SWs of 20 kHz and 10 kHz were utilized. However, use of high-Q yet low-SW rf coils would advantageously enable greater
values of the SNR and Aγ constant. A potential
solution to these contradictory requirements (high-Q coils versus high-SW MRI) without loss of SNR as noted by Baudin
et al.43 involves rf probe Q-spoiling by active feedback to increase the imaging bandwidth at
low resonance frequencies. Such Q-spoiling is most
desirable as it simultaneously enables MRI using high-Q rf probes for high-SW imaging at very low resonance frequencies.

Conclusion
High-resolution (94 × 94 μm2) MRI of proton
and 13C HP contrast agents has been demonstrated at a low
magnetic field of 47.5 mT. The achieved spatial resolution of the
presented molecular imaging rivals that of micro-PET.39 The HyperBridge and HyperGate magnetic devices were successfully
demonstrated for transportation of hyperpolarized contrast agents
from the hyperpolarizer to the preclinical low-field MRI scanner.
The presented technological advances of low-field MRI already can
enable preclinical molecular imaging of proton and 13C
hyperpolarized contrast agents, and there are no fundamental barriers
for future clinical translation. For example, DNP hyperpolarized 1-13C-pyruvate is already being used in clinical trials.5 With respect to parahydrogen-based methods for
hyperpolarization, hyperpolarized succinates and hyperpolarized phospholactate
are particularly well-suited for molecular imaging using the technologies
described here. 13C-succinates potentially report on abnormal
citric acid cycle metabolism in cancer.4,44,45 1-13C-phospholactate can be hyperpolarized
via PHIP to %P13C > 15%.46 When injected into living organisms, 1-13C-phospholactate
is rapidly dephosphorylated (within seconds) to 1-13C-lactate47 and therefore can be potentially used for cancer
imaging in similar fashion to DNP hyperpolarized 1-13C-lactate
and 1-13C-pyruvate.48,49 However, one advantage
for hyperpolarized 13C-lactate compared to 13C-pyruvate is the fact that it can be used within a physiologically
relevant in vivo concentration range.48

Other technical improvements in low-field
rf coil development involve
the use of superconducting or cryogenically cooled rf coils to increase
the detection sensitivity by several fold,50,51 leading to concomitant improvements in the resolution limits. Furthermore,
the use of compressed sensing in conjunction with faster and more
sensitive imaging sequences30 can further
improve the detection sensitivity and accelerate total imaging time.

Methods
PHIP/SABRE
Polarizer
A 5.75 mT electromagnet-based
polarizer produced the SABRE-polarized pyridine and PHIP-polarized
1-13C-succinate-d2. Details
of the polarizer are summarized in Supporting
Information text. Briefly, the polarizer is fully automated
with a console-based graphical user interface. The polarizer controller
unit employs open-source computer software applied in previous work8,52,53 and utilizes a chemical reactor,
mixing manifold, and rf probe design similar to ones reported earlier.21,54

47.5 mT MRI System
Low-field MR spectra and images
were acquired using a 47.5 mT MR scanner (89 mm i.d. bore) equipped
with Prospa software (version 3.12, Magritek, Wellington, New Zealand).
Previously developed, 38 mm i.d. dual-channel rf probes were used
for imaging in 13C/1H and 1H/13C configurations. These probes have crystal-radio solenoid
rf coils whose detection sensitivity was optimized for the primary
(first-listed) channel’s resonance frequency ω0 (2.02 MHz for 1H, X tuned to 0.508 MHz for 13C).19

Production and Transfer
of HP Contrast Media
An N-heterocyclic
carbene complex-based Ir catalyst55,56 was prepared
as described previously.57,58 Solutions (∼2
mL) of the Ir-catalyst and Py substrate in methanol-d4 were used for SABRE hyperpolarization in a standard
10 mm NMR tube with ∼7 mM [IrCl(COD)(IMes)]57 [IMes = 1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl), imidazole-2-ylidene;
COD = cyclooctadiene] catalyst concentration and ∼100 mM Py
substrate concentration. For SABRE, the polarizer was operated with
the rf probe removed with an estimated solution temperature of ∼40
°C. Ultrahigh purity (>99.999% H2) parahydrogen
gas
with >90% para- state59 was bubbled
through
the solution for 2 min to generate HP pyridine.56,60 Immediately after cessation of bubbling, the HP Py was transferred
through Earth’s field to the imaging system (see the Supporting Information for details), where images
were obtained ∼12 s after hyperpolarization, a time sufficient
to significantly depolarize HP Ir-hydride and HP ortho-H2 (T1 ∼2–3 s at 9.4 T in
these solutions) but not HP Py (T1 ∼
21 s at 9.4 T58 and T1 = 11.1 ± 0.1 s at 47.5 mT).

13C HP
1-13C-succinate-d261 was produced using the PASADENA62 method, employing 30 mM 1-13C-fumaric acid-d2 precursor in aqueous medium at pH > 9 and
5 mM Rh(I) catalyst. The Rh(I) catalyst was prepared as described
previously63 using bis(norbornadiene)rhodium(I)
tetrafluoroborate (Strem no. 45-0230, Newburyport, MA) and 1,4-bis[(phenyl-3-propanesulfonate)
phosphine]butane (no. 717347, Sigma-Aldrich-Isotec, OH). The % polarization
of the HP 1-13C-succinate-d2 was tested in situ(21) of the PHIP polarizer. All handling of the HP 1-13C-succinate-d2 prior to sample insertion into the low-field
imaging system took place in magnetic fields generated by the “HyperBridge”
and “HyperGate” to preserve hyperpolarization (Supporting Information text), Figure 1. Images were obtained from ∼45 μmol
of HCA in 1.5 mL of water loaded into a 15 mL Falcon tube (part 14-959-70C,
Fisher Scientific). Because only one low-field MR console was available
for PHIP 1H → 13C hyperpolarization transfer
and low-field MRI, the rf cables had to be switched (from PHIP probe
to MRI probe) after 1-13C-succinate-d2 PHIP in order to acquire images. Further details are given
in the Supporting Information text.

Imaging
Protocol/Parameters
One 2D gradient echo (GRE)
image without slice selection was acquired from each freshly polarized
individual HCA batch using a planar GRE imaging sequence provided
in Prospa software, where the parameters varied for MRI acquisition
in two mutually orthogonal imaging planes. Proton Py images used 128
× 128 or 256 × 256 pixel matrices over fields of view (FOV)
ranging from 24 × 24 mm2 to 64 × 64 mm2 with corresponding k-space under-sampling (defined
as percentage of acquired k-space projections). Py
GRE imaging parameters for 375 × 375 μm2 in-plane
pixel resolution were echo time (TE) = 7 ms, repetition time (TR)
= 60 ms (limited by the electronics response time), and time of acquisition
(tAcq) = 6.4 ms. Imaging parameters for
188 × 188 μm2 and 94 × 94 μm2 in-plane pixel resolution images were TE = 13 ms, TR = 60
ms, and tAcq = 12.8 ms. Other imaging
parameters are provided in Figures 2 and 3. Quality assurance reporting on the level of %PH of the HCA before imaging at 47.5 mT was performed
with 90° square excitation rf pulses in a separate experimental
series. For the 13C HCA, %P13C was measured spectroscopically in the MRI scanner immediately after
the sample transfer from PHIP polarizer via the HyperBridge and HyperGate
(using a 15° square rf excitation pulse). GRE imaging followed
immediately after spectroscopic polarization measurements. All 13C imaging of 1-13C-succinate-d2 was performed with a 64 × 64 mm2 FOV,
TE = 26 ms, TR = 110 ms (limited by the electronics response time), tAcq = 25.6 ms, and a fixed pulse angle of 30°.
Other imaging parameters are provided in Figure 4.
