The human complement
C9 protein (∼65 kDa) is a member of
the complement pathway. It plays an essential role in the membrane
attack complex (MAC), which forms a lethal pore on the cellular surface
of pathogenic bacteria. Here, we charted in detail the structural
microheterogeneity of C9 purified from human blood serum, using an
integrative workflow combining high-resolution native mass spectrometry
and (glyco)peptide-centric proteomics. The proteoform profile of C9
was acquired by high-resolution native mass spectrometry, which revealed
the co-occurrence of ∼50 distinct mass spectrometry (MS) signals.
Subsequent peptide-centric analysis, through proteolytic digestion
of C9 and liquid chromatography (LC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)
measurements of the resulting peptide mixtures, provided site-specific
quantitative profiles of three different types of C9 glycosylation
and validation of the native MS data. Our study provides a detailed
specification, validation, and quantification of 15 co-occurring C9
proteoforms and the first direct experimental evidence of O-linked glycans in the N-terminal region.
Additionally, next to the two known glycosylation sites, a third novel,
albeit low abundant, N-glycosylation site on C9 is
identified, which surprisingly does not possess the canonical N-glycosylation sequence N-X-S/T. Our data also reveal a
binding of up to two Ca2+ ions to C9. Mapping all detected
and validated sites of modifications on a structural model of C9,
as present in the MAC, hints at their putative roles in pore formation
or receptor interactions. The applied methods herein represent a powerful
tool for the unbiased in-depth analysis of plasma proteins and may
advance biomarker discovery, as aberrant glycosylation profiles may
be indicative of the pathophysiological state of the patients.

==== Body
Post-translational
modifications
(PTMs) of proteins regulate their activity, localization, turnover,
interactions, and many other important physiological processes.1,2 Of all possible PTMs, protein glycosylation is one of the most abundant
yet structurally diverse PTM, making it analytically and biochemically
challenging to monitor.3 This is because
the enzymes involved in the glycosylation machinery can produce diverse
glycosylation patterns on proteins and heterogeneous populations of
glycans at every occupied glycosylation site.4−6 In addition,
these modifications are also present in nonstoichiometric amounts
with multiple varieties of chemical moieties involved. Thus, new methods
are needed for their detailed analysis. Recent progress in high-resolution
native electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS) can provide
a novel means to facilitate the in-depth analysis of all coappearing
modifications, at least when they are distinguishable in mass.7−9 In combination with peptide-centric proteomics, this approach is
very useful for high detail analysis of PTMs on proteins from different
biological sources and can provide direct assessment of the biosimilarity
among similar therapeutic proteins.10 Through
integrating native MS data and peptide-centric proteomics, one can
obtain information about composition, stoichiometry, site-specificity,
and relative abundance of the modifications at each site. Moreover,
a direct cross-evaluation of both data sets (native MS and peptide-centric
MS) validates completeness of each approach and provides reliability
for the quantitative profiling of protein proteoforms. So far, in
the analysis of protein proteoforms, most MS methods typically use
denaturing conditions prior to the ESI process.11−14 These conditions inevitably disrupt
protein tertiary and quaternary structures. Although native MS is
often regarded as somewhat less sensitive, it provides the advantage
that the resulting mass spectra are less congested, as the ion signals
are distributed over a substantially fewer number of charge states
and over a wider m/z window. Collectively,
such hybrid mass spectrometry strategies have the potential to become
beneficial for the study of biologically important (glyco)proteins,
whereby knowledge about their precise modifications is crucial in
understanding their activity and function.

Most proteins in
human blood plasma are decorated by a plethora
of PTMs, particularly involving glycosylation, and the complement
component protein C9 is not an exception.15 Human C9 is primarily produced in the liver and plays a key role
in the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), together with
the other complement proteins C5, C6, C7, and C8. While several cryoEM
maps have recently become available for the MAC,16,17 no detailed structure is available for its C9 component. Still,
amino acid alignments have identified several domains in C9 based
on its homology to other proteins. These include the N-terminal type 1 thrombospondin (TSP) domain, a low-density lipoprotein
receptor class A repeat (LDLRA), a number of potential transmembrane
regions, and the C-terminal epidermal growth factor
(EGF)-like domain (Figure 1).18 The majority of the detailed
characterization studies of the PTMs occurring on C9 dates back to
the previous century, when techniques used to perform such analysis
were very cumbersome. In these early studies, C9 was reported to be N-glycosylated;19−21 however, no current evidence
exists regarding the composition and heterogeneity of these N-linked glycans. Moreover, although suspected, no direct
proof has been reported for the presence of O-linked
glycans. C9 is additionally modified by a rarer type of glycosylation: C-mannosylation.22 With such
a diverse repertoire of modifications, C9 not only presents a challenging
analytical target but also imparts a potential variability in its
physiological functioning. Exemplary findings to support this statement
come from reports wherein the extracellular Ser phosphorylation of
C9 by ecto-protein kinases in cancer cells K562 was proposed to serve
as a protective mechanism against complement in tumor cells.23 Moreover, C9 with fucosylated N-glycans has been suggested as a biomarker for squamous cell lung
cancer, as patients tend to show overproduction of these proteoforms.24 A detailed map of the full proteoform profile
of serum-derived complement component C9 is, therefore, of high interest.

Figure 1 Schematic
of domain composition and primary structure of C9. The
scheme includes previously reported sites of C-mannosylation22 and N-glycosylation on C9.19−21 The glycan nomenclature used is indicated at the bottom.

Here, we report an unbiased and in-depth analysis
of the complement
component C9 protein isolated from pooled human blood serum (of at
least three donors) using modern, hybrid MS technologies. Our data
provides a detailed view of the modifications co-occurring on C9.
We validate all identified PTMs from high quality tandem mass spectrometry
(MS/MS) spectra using a peptide-centric approach. In addition to the
earlier reported C9 modifications, our data revealed the attachment
of mucin type of O-glycosylation in the N-terminal part of C9, providing the first experimental evidence of
this modification on C9. Except information about PTMs, our native
MS measurements suggest binding of up to two Ca2+ ions
on C9. Since the N-terminal region of C9 seems to
play a crucial role in the C9 polymerization process and thus also
in the assembly of MAC,25 the role of the
here identified O-glycosylation site may act as a
target for further functional investigations. Moreover, we identified
a novel low abundant N-glycosylation site on N215
that is highly conserved throughout mammals and does not adhere to
the typical N-glycosylation sequon N-X-S/T (X can
be any amino acid except P).

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Materials
Complement component C9 (Uniprot
Code: P02748) purified from pooled human blood plasma (more than three healthy
donors) was acquired from Complement Technology, Inc. (Texas, USA).
The sample was purified according to a standard protocol26 (the certificate of analysis is attached in
the Supporting Information S5). Dithiothreitol
(DTT), iodoacetamide (IAA), and ammonium acetate (AMAC) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). Formic acid (FA) was from
Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Acetonitrile (ACN) was purchased from
Biosolve (Valkenswaard, The Netherlands). POROS Oligo R3 50 μm
particles were obtained from PerSeptive Biosystems (Framingham, MA,
USA) and packed into GELoader pipet tips (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany).
Sequencing grade trypsin was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI).
Glu-C, Asp-N, PNGase F, and Sialidase were obtained from Roche (Indianapolis,
USA).

Sample Preparation for Native MS
Unprocessed protein
solution in a phosphate buffer at pH 7.2, containing ∼30–40
μg of C9, was buffer exchanged into 150 mM aqueous AMAC (pH
7.5) by ultrafiltration (vivaspin500, Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Germany)
using a 10 kDa cutoff filter. The resulting protein concentration
was measured by UV absorbance at 280 nm and adjusted to 2–3
μM prior to native MS analysis. The enzyme Sialidase was used
to remove sialic acid residues from C9. PNGase F was used to cleave
the N-glycans of C9.26 All samples were buffer exchanged to 150 mM AMAC (pH 7.2) prior
to native MS measurements.

Native MS Analysis
Samples were
analyzed on a modified
Exactive Plus Orbitrap instrument with extended mass range (EMR) (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Bremen) using a standard m/z range of 500–10 000, as described in detail
previously.27 The voltage offsets on the
transport multipoles and ion lenses were manually tuned to achieve
optimal transmission of protein ions at elevated m/z. Nitrogen was used in the higher-energy collisional
dissociation (HCD) cell at a gas pressure of 6–8 × 10–10 bar. MS parameters used: spray voltage, 1.2–1.3
V; source fragmentation, 30 V; source temperature, 250 °C; collision
energy, 30 V; resolution (at m/z 200), 30 000. The instrument was mass calibrated as described
previously, using a solution of CsI.27

Native MS Data Analysis
The accurate masses of the
observed C9 proteoforms were calculated manually averaging over all
detected charge states of C9. For PTM composition analysis, data were
processed manually and glycan structures were deduced on the basis
of known biosynthetic pathways. Average masses were used for the PTM
assignments, including hexose/mannose/galactose (Hex/Man/Gal, 162.1424
Da), N-acetylhexosamine/N-acetylglucosamine
(HexNAc/GlcNAc/GalNAc, 203.1950 Da), and N-acetylneuraminic
acid (NeuAc, 291.2579 Da). All used symbols and text nomenclature
are according to recommendations of the Consortium for Functional
Glycomics.

In-Solution Digestion for Peptide-Centric
Glycoproteomics
Intact human C9 protein in PBS buffer (10
mM sodium phosphate,
145 mM NaCl, pH 7.3) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL was reduced with
5 mM DTT at 56 °C for 30 min and alkylated with 15 mM IAA at
room temperature for 30 min in the dark. The excess of IAA was quenched
by using 5 mM DTT. C9 was digested overnight with trypsin at an enzyme-to-protein-ratio
of 1:100 (w/w) at 37 °C. Another C9 sample was digested for 4
h by using Asp-N at an enzyme-to-protein ratio of 1:75 (w/w) at 37
°C, and the resulted peptide mixtures were further treated with
trypsin (1:100; w/w) overnight at 37 °C. All proteolytic digests
containing modified glycopeptides were desalted by GELoader tips filled
with POROS Oligo R3 50 μm particles,28 dried, and dissolved in 40 μL of 0.1% FA prior to liquid chromatography
(LC)-MS and MS/MS analysis.

LC-MS and MS/MS Analysis
All peptides
(typically 300
fmol of C9 peptides) were separated and analyzed using an Agilent
1290 Infinity HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn. Germany)
coupled online to an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Reversed-phase separation was accomplished
using a 100 μm inner diameter 2 cm trap column (in-housed packed
with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ, 3 μm) (Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen,
Germany) coupled to a 50 μm inner diameter 50 cm analytical
column (in-house packed with Poroshell 120 EC-C18, 2.7 μm) (Agilent
Technologies, Amstelveen, The Netherlands). Mobile-phase solvent A
consisted of 0.1% FA in water, and mobile-phase solvent B consisted
of 0.1% FA in ACN. The flow rate was set to 300 nL/min. A 45 min gradient
was used as follows: 0–10 min, 100% solvent A; 10.1–35
min, 10% solvent B; 35–38 min, 45% solvent B; 38–40
min, 100% solvent B; 40–45 min, 100% solvent A. Nanospray was
achieved using a coated fused silica emitter (New Objective, Cambridge,
MA) (outer diameter, 360 μm; inner diameter, 20 μm; tip
inner diameter, 10 μm) biased to 2 kV. The mass spectrometer
was operated in positive ion mode, and the spectra were acquired in
the data dependent acquisition mode. For the MS scans, the mass range
was set from 300 to 2000 m/z at
a resolution of 60 000 and the AGC target was set to 4 ×
105. For the MS/MS measurements, HCD and electron-transfer
and higher-energy collision dissociation (EThcD) were used. HCD was
performed with normalized collision energy of 15% and 35%, respectively.
A supplementary activation energy of 20% was used for EThcD. For the
MS/MS scans, the mass range was set from 100 to 2000 m/z, and the resolution was set to 30 000;
the AGC target was set to 5 × 105. The precursor isolation
width was 1.6 Da, and the maximum injection time was set to 300 ms.

LC/MS and MS/MS Data Analysis
Raw data were interpreted
by using the Byonic software suite (Protein Metrics Inc.),29 and further validation of the key MS/MS spectra
was performed manually. The following parameters were used for data
searches: precursor ion mass tolerance, 10 ppm; product ion mass tolerance,
20 ppm; fixed modification, Cys carbamidomethyl; variable modification:
Met oxidation, Trp mannosylation, and both N- and O-glycosylation from mammalian glycan databases. A nonenzyme
specificity search was chosen for all samples. The database used contained
the C9 protein amino acid sequence (Uniprot Code: P02748). Profiling
and relative quantification of PTM modified C9 peptides were achieved
by use of the extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) from two independently
processed C9 samples. The peptide mixtures were prepared with different
combinations of proteolytic enzymes as described above ((1) Trypsin;
(2) AspN + Trypsin). For peak area calculations, the first three isotopes
were taken from each manually validated peptide proteoform. Integrated
peak areas were normalized for all PTM sites individually, and the
average peptide ratios from the two samples were taken as a final
estimation of the abundance. The XICs were obtained using the software
Skyline.30 The glycan structures of each
glycoform were manually annotated. Hereby reported glycan structures
are depicted without the linkage type of glycan units, since the acquired
MS/MS patterns do not provide such information.

Combining Native
MS and Peptide-Centric Proteomic Data
Reliability and completeness
of the obtained proteoform profiles
of C9 were assessed by an integrative approach combining the native
MS data with the glycopeptide centric proteomics data. Details of
this approach have been described in detail previously.10 Briefly, in silico data construction
of the “intact protein spectra” was performed on the
basis of the masses and relative abundances of all site-specific PTMs
derived from the glycopeptide centric analysis. Subsequently, the
constructed spectrum was compared to the experimental native MS spectra
of C9. The similarity between the two independent data sets (Native
MS spectra and constructed spectra based on glycopeptide centric data)
was expressed by a Pearson correlation factor. All R scripts used
for the spectra simulation are available at github (https://github.com/Yang0014/glycoNativeMS). All C9 proteoforms predicted from the peptide-centric data were
further filtered by taking 0.5% cutoff in relative intensity of the
peaks in the experimental native spectrum, and mass deviations were
manually checked.

Results
Native MS Analysis Provides
Hints about Novel Unexpected PTMs
and Ca2+ Binding to C9
We started our investigation
by first acquiring high-resolution native ESI-MS spectra of the human
complement component C9 (Figure 2a). The recorded native MS spectrum of C9 shows at
least five different charge states, ranging from [M + 13H]13+ to [M + 17H]17+. Each charge state contains various ion
series that correspond to different masses and thus different proteoforms
of C9. On the basis of their distinguishable masses, taking a 1% cutoff
in relative intensity of the peaks, we can distinguish at least ∼50
co-occurring MS signals. Since we suspected these could correspond
to different proteoforms of C9, we set out to further examine and
validate our findings.

Figure 2 Full native ESI-MS spectrum of the intact C9 sprayed from
aqueous
ammonium acetate (a). The charge states are indicated. Zoom in on
the 15+ charged state in the inset reveals approximately
50 distinct ion signals. (b) Zoom in on the 15+ charged
state, centered around m/z 4500,
in the native mass spectra of intact C9. In (c), alike spectrum of
C9 treated with PNGase F for 4 h reveals partial N-deglycosylation. In (d), C9 was treated with PNGase F for 48 h.
In (e), C9 was first enzymatically desialylated, and in (f), C9 was
partially denatured, prior to native MS analysis. The differences
in mass between C9 proteoforms in the unprocessed and treated samples
allows the deduction of the PTM composition of these most abundant
C9 proteoforms. The mass of the most abundant ion in the unprocessed
sample, at m/z of 4435.28, is 66 516.20
Da, from which a calculated composition of PTMs can be derived, Hex12HexNAc9NeuAc6 unambiguously.
The 15 positive charges come from 13 H+ and 1 Ca2+ ion, due to the presence of a bound Ca2+ ion, as revealed
in (f).

To simplify the visualization
of the C9 proteoform profile, we
focused on the most intense charge state (15+). The average
mass of the protein backbone of C9 is 60 954.02 Da. In this
mass calculation, we used the mass of the C9 backbone sequence lacking
the N-terminal signal peptide, corrected by the mass
shift induced by the 12 disulfide bonds present in C9 (−24
× 1.0079 Da). Compared to, for instance, chicken ovalbumin31 and CHO derived erythropotein,10 which we previously analyzed by high-resolution native
mass spectrometry, the native mass spectra of C9 are remarkably less
heterogeneous, especially since, according to previously published
data, C9 has been shown to be C-mannosylated22 at the TPS domain and N-glycosylated19−21 at two sites in the MACPF domain.

Looking at the inset in Figure 2a, the mass difference
of 656 Da between the abundant
peaks with m/z of 4435.28 and 4479.02
corresponds to the glycan composition HexNAc1Hex1NeuAc1. The same mass difference can be observed
between the abundant peaks with m/z of 4415.89 and 4459.61. This may correspond to either variability
in the number of antennas on the N-glycans or the
additional attachment of mucin type O-glycans. To
address this, we next treated the protein with various enzymes that
cleave off parts of the glycan moieties. The removal of N-glycans or sialic acid residues resulted in specific mass shifts,
allowing us to calculate and partly predict the PTM composition of
C9. For cleavage of N-glycosylations, we used PNGaseF
(Figure 2b–d)
and sialidase for the specific removal of sialic acids (Figure 2e). We subsequently subjected
these treated C9 samples to native MS analysis. The incubation of
C9 with PNGase F for 4 h at room temperature resulted in a removal
of one of the two N-glycan chains (Figure 2c). The mass difference of
2206 Da between the most abundant intact C9 proteoform and the N-deglycosylated C9 indicated the attachment of a N-glycan with the composition of HexNAc4Hex5NeuAc2. A prolonged treatment (48 h; 37 °C)
of C9 with PNGase F resulted in a second major mass shift of 2206
Da corresponding to a loss of the second N-glycan
(Figure 2d). A closer
look at the native MS spectrum of C9 exposed another lower abundant
ion series in the higher mass range region suggesting the existence
of an unexpected third N-glycosylation site. The
observed mass difference of 2206 Da in the intact C9 between the peaks
with m/z of 4435.28 and 4582.33
strongly indicates the presence of a third N-glycan
with a similar composition as the other two known sites (Figure 2b–d).

The heterogeneity in the proteoform profile of the fully N-deglycosylated C9 remained very similar (Figure 2b,d). Therefore, the observed
mass differences of 656 Da most likely correspond to O-linked glycan chains with the overall composition of HexNAc1Hex1NeuAc1. Additionally, a mass
difference of 947 Da between the peaks with m/z of 4435.28 and 4498.41 and between 4415.89 and 4459.61
suggests the occurrence of disialylated mucin O-glycans
with the overall composition of HexNAc1Hex1NeuAc2. For the further assessment of the PTM composition
of C9, we treated C9 with sialidase. The removal of sialic acid residues
resulted in a pronounced simplification of the structural heterogeneity
in C9 (Figure 2e).
The proteoform occurring at 4435.284 m/z, which is known to contain only two occupied N-glycosylation
sites, shifted to 4318.80 m/z, corresponding
to an overall loss of six sialic acid moieties. Four out of six of
these sialic acids were cleaved off from the two N-glycans. The remaining two sialic acids are thus most likely attached
to O-glycans. This assumption is based on the mass
difference of 1147.72 Da between the overall mass of C9 PTMs (66 513.76–60 954.02
Da = 5559.74 Da) and the total mass of N-glycans
in the most abundant C9 proteoform represented by the peak with m/z of 4435.28 (2 × 2206.01 Da = 4412.02
Da). Since the proteoform occurring at 4435.28 m/z contains one O-glycan, further sequential
mass differences (656 and 947 Da respectively) among the peaks with m/z of 4435.28, 4498.41, and 4542.22 suggest
at least three O-glycans are attached to C9.

As mentioned above, the expected total mass of PTMs for the proteoform
present at 4435.28 m/z is 5559.74
Da. This estimation is based on the assumption that all charges on
the C9 in the native MS spectrum come from H+. However,
the total mass of experimentally proven PTM composition (Hex12HexNAc9NeuAc6) is 5522.01 Da. The
remaining mass of 37.73 Da (5559.74–5522.01 Da) can be explained
by the presence of a Ca2+ ion (40.076 Da) in the structure
of C9. This means that the 15 charges present on the C9 at 4435.28 m/z come from 13 H+ and one
from Ca2+. In that case, the deprotonated mass of the most
abundant proteoform with all PTMs and a Ca2+ ion is 66 516.20,
which corresponds to a small standard deviation of ±0.05 Da with
respect to the calculated C9 mass: 66 516.11 Da. This hypothesis
was supported by the recording native MS profile of the partly denatured
C9 (Figure 2f). Denaturation
of C9 through the addition of 1% formic acid resulted in a release
of Ca2+ and corresponding mass shifts of all ions in the
spectrum. This indicates that C9 can bind two Ca2+ ions,
whereby the most abundant proteoforms contain just one bound Ca2+ ion.

Analysis of N-Glycosylation
Revealed a Noncanonical N-Glycosylation Site on Asn215
C9 is a glycoprotein
containing two known canonical N-glycosylation sites
(N256 and N394). Our native MS measurements suggest the presence of
a novel third low abundant N-glycosylation site.
To validate this finding, C9 was digested using different proteolytic
enzymes and the resulting peptide mixtures were analyzed by peptide
centric LC-MS/MS. Data interpretation provided information about the
site location, glycan type, composition, and abundance of all three N-glycans. Low energy HCD MS/MS spectra of the tryptic peptides
with amino acid sequences FSYSKNETYQLFLSYSSK
and AVNITSENLIDDVVSLIR clearly
revealed the composition of the two known N-glycans
on N256 and N394 (Figure S1a,b). Improved
sequence coverage obtained by EThcD MS/MS further confirmed the amino
acid sequence of these N-glycopeptides. In addition,
we also identified the third N-glycosylation site
at N215, using the tryptic peptide TSNFNAAISLK (N215). Low energy HCD (Figure 3a) and EThcD MS/MS (Figure 3b) spectra of this glycopeptide unambiguously
confirmed its amino acid sequence, localization, and the composition
of the N-glycan. Markedly, this newly determined N-glycosylation site does not adhere to the canonical N-X-S/T
motif.

Figure 3 Low energy HCD MS/MS (a) and EThcD MS/MS (b) spectra of the peptide
harboring the novel, noncanonical N-glycosylation
site at N215, derived by tryptic digestion of C9. Both spectra were
acquired for the same precursor with m/z of 1124.13 Da. Sequential fragmentation of the N-glycan moiety in the spectrum (a) allowed deduction of its glycan
composition while the EThcD spectrum (b) provided confirmation of
the peptide sequence and position of the N-glycan.
“P” = peptide backbone of the glycopeptide.

Analysis of O-Glycosylation
Confirmed the Presence
up to Three O-Glycans
Peptide-centric LC
MS/MS analysis also provided direct evidence of the existence of three O-glycosylation sites on C9. Figure S2 displays annotated EThcD MS/MS spectra of the C9 N-terminal peptide with amino acid sequence QYTTSYDPELTESSGSASHIDCR
derived from proteolytic digestion of the C9 with AspN and trypsin.
This peptide contains an N-terminal Q and exhibits
a significant level of cyclization to pyroglutamic acid. Such N-terminal modifications are frequently reported in LC-MS/MS
analysis.32 Manual inspection of the MS/MS
spectra exposed the structural composition of the attached O-glycans. These were mucin type O-glycans
with 0, 1, or 2 sialic acids connected to the core structure HexNAc1Hex1. The peptide was found to be modified with
up two O-glycans; however, their precise location
could not be determined, as the fragmentation spectra lack sufficient
signature ions. A peptide bearing the third O-glycosylation
site, which is present in the native MS spectrum, was not detected
in LC MS/MS, presumably due to its low abundance.

C9 TSP Domain
Harbors Two C-Mannosylation Sites
C9 contains
a thrombospondin (TSP) domain, which may be C-mannosylated.22 Looking back
on the native MS profile of the intact C9, the most abundant peaks
with m/z of 4415.89 and 4435.28
are in a vicinity with their lower abundant forms (4426.65 m/z and 4446.08 m/z) differing in mass by 162 Da. The same mass difference
can also be observed in the N-deglycosylated and
the desialylated C9, which corresponds to the presence of a single
Hex. Peptide-centric LC MS/MS detected peptides originating from the
MSPWSEWSQCDPCLR sequence. This peptide contains
the well-known sequence motif WXXW, which is frequently mannosylated
in proteins with TSP repeats.33 Our EThcD
MS/MS spectra unequivocally confirmed that in C9 W27 is fully occupied
by C-mannosylation, whereas W30 is only partially
occupied (Figure S3a,b).

Defining the
Overall Structural Heterogeneity, Validation, and
Quantification of C9 Proteoforms
Next, we also assessed the
relative abundance of the different proteforms of C9. Figure 4a shows the overall view on
all detected C9 proteoforms in the annotated native spectrum. The
site-specific characterization of C9 is based on peptide-centric proteomics
data (Figure 4b, Table S1). Two N-glycosylation
sites (N256 and N394) are fully occupied by complex biantennary N-glycans with sialylated antennas, each with a low degree
of structural heterogeneity (only ∼4% of the N-glycans at N256 have one of the antennas nonsialylated). The third
novel noncanonical N-glycosylation site at N215 is
occupied only in ∼1% of C9, carrying the same type of glycan
as the other two N-glycosylation sites. In contrast
to the N-glycosylation, the O-glycosylation
exhibits higher variability in its degree of sialylation. EThcD MS/MS
spectra conclusively confirmed the composition of the presented O-glycan chains. The N-terminal peptides
that contain an amino acid sequence of QYTTSYDPELTESSGSASHIDCR
possess mucin type O-glycans with a different level
of sialylation. In 36% of C9, the peptide is occupied by an O-glycan with a sialic acid attached to both glycan units,
HexNAc and Hex. The most abundant form (52%) represents O-glycan chains with one sialic acid attached to Hex. The lowest abundant
form (8%) contains a nonsialylated O-glycan core.
Unfortunately, our EThcD MS/MS spectra did not reveal the exact location
of the O-glycosylated sites; however, the observed
dual series of c, z, y, and b ions indirectly suggest that T11 is likely
occupied (Figure S2b–d). The O-glycopeptide with two attached O-glycans
is presented in less than 3% of relative abundance. The N-terminal peptide was also found to be unmodified (Figure S2a); however, its abundance is almost negligible (0.5%).
Moreover, C-mannosylation contributes to the C9 heterogeneity
with a variable occupancy of W residues by Man in the sequence motif
WXXW. Tryptophan 27 is 100% occupied by Man, while W30 is only partially
modified (23%).

Relative abundances of peptide proteoforms were estimated from their

set to 100%. For clarity, only parts of the peptide sequence carrying
PTMs are shown below the graph. (c) A comparison of the intact C9

System, Version 1.8 Schrödinger, LLC. (e) Overview of the C9
sequence with all identified PTM sites, wherein the newly discovered O-glycosylation sites at the N-terminus

are highlighted in orange and purple, respectively.

A comparison of the intact C9 native MS spectrum
with in
silico constructed MS spectrum (Figure 4c) reveals a high degree of consistency between
the native MS and peptide-centric MS approach (R =
0.92). Using this method, 15 C9 proteoforms could be validated (Table S2). The unmatched peaks mostly correspond
to C9 proteoforms containing two Ca2+ ions and species
that were not detected during the peptide centric analysis. For example,
the peak at m/z 4479.08 most likely
corresponds to the C9 proteoform containing two O-glycans with one and two sialic acids on the core HexNAc1Hex1. Since a peptide with this PTMs composition
was not detected by LC-MS/MS, the reconstructed native-like spectrum
does not contain this proteoform. Several nonannotated low abundant
ions signals correspond to Na+ and/or K+ adducts,
which are very frequent artifacts in native MS. The constructed spectrum
also contains systematic artifacts, caused by the fact that labile
PTMs are easily lost during the peptide-centric LC MS/MS analysis.34 In our case, the most prevalent artifacts are
glycopeptides that lose partly their sialic acids and O-linked glycan chains. Other MS signals with relative abundance below
0.5% were eventually filtered out during the validation process.

This cross-correlation of the data pinpoints the advantages of
uniting native MS and peptide-centric LC-MS/MS, as well as the weaknesses
associated with the use of only a peptide centric approach. Without
the information obtained from the native MS measurements, the undesired
peptide artifacts and modifications that are not detected or overlooked
at the peptide-centric level would not have been discovered. Still,
the consistency between both data sets is very high (R = 0.92), verifying that we did cover and validate most of detected
signal of the C9 proteoforms and their PTMs in a comprehensive manner.

Discussion
All previous reports on C9 PTMs were largely
focused on only one
type of PTM. From these studies, it has been known that C9 is N-glycosylated19−21 and C-mannosylated22 with 8% of the total mass of C9 originating
from these attached glycans.35 The majority
of these glycan chains are distributed between the two previously
known N-glycosylation sites (N256 and N394); however,
their exact monosaccharide composition had so far remained elusive.
A study suggested that the N-linked glycans of C9
are of the tri- or tetra-antennary complex type since neither endo
F nor endo H released the glycans.21 Here,
we unambiguously determined the composition of these N-glycans using low energy HCD. In agreement with previous observations,
the N-deglycosylation reaction proceeded sequentially
and in a time dependent manner.21 Incubation
of C9 with PNGase F for 4 h at 37 °C resulted in the cleavage
of a single N-linked glycan. The second N-glycan (N256) was released only after prolonged incubation (48 h).
Surprisingly, the native MS profile of N-deglycosylated
C9 was shifted in mass but did not substantially change in comparison
with the native MS profile of the intact C9, revealing the homogeneous N-glycosylation patterns on C9.

As C9 contains only
two canonical N-glycosylation
sequons, the observation of a third N-glycosylation,
located at N215 (NAA), was not expected. The N-glycosylation sequon N-X-S/T is well established. However,
a few reports have shown N-glycosylation in the sequence
N-X-C36−38 or N-X-V.39,40 In this regard, a high-resolution
structural model of the bacterial oligosaccharyltransferase (OTase)
provided evidence that an amino acid in the +2 position increases
the binding affinity of N to the active site of OTase, but it is not
the key requirement for a glycosylation. Rather, key requirements
are that the position of the N residue be at the surface of a protein,
neutrality of the amino acid in the +2 position, and compatibility
with correct folding.41 Nevertheless, our
findings seem to represent a very unique case as an N-glycan attached to the N in the NAA sequence has, as far as we know,
no analogy in the available literature. All three found N-glycans are biantennary complex type and only slightly vary in their
degree of terminal sialylation. Despite the fact that experimental
evidence about N-glycosylation is available mostly
for human C9, sequence analysis of C9 from various species and their
alignment provided an interesting view on the C9 glycosylation in
general (see Figure S4).

Although
the presence of O-glycans on C9 was proposed
more than 20 years ago,21 no direct evidence
has been previously reported. Mucin type O-linked
glycan chains, which were found in this study, are mostly located
at the N-terminal part of the C9. The amino acid
sequence QYTTSYDPELTESSGSASHIDCR of
the N-terminal peptide does not seem to contain any
distinct sequence motif for O-glycosylation; however,
our integrated hybrid MS approach unambiguously demonstrated that O-glycans are attached to C9. The highly labile nature of O-glycans and their typically weak ionization response may
have hampered their detection in earlier MS analysis. EThcD MS/MS
spectra of the C9 O-glycosylated peptides revealed
the composition of the O-linked glycan chains that
are consistent with a core 1 type (GalNAc, also known as T-antigen).
This structure is further terminally modified by a sialylation whereby
the disialyl core 1 type was found to be the most abundant. Here,
we report O-glycosylation of C9 for the first time,
so the possible functional significance of these modifications remains
speculative. Interestingly, it is known that the domain within the
first 16 amino acids at the N-terminus of C9 is crucial
in regulating the self-polymerization of C9.25 Since the N-termini and also the putative O-glycosylation sites are not highly conserved among mammals
(Figure S4), it seems unlikely that the O-glycans would play a significant role in the polymerization
process, unless this is species specific as well. O-Linked glycans can also bind bacterial carbohydrate binding receptors.42 It is therefore tempting to speculate that the O-glycans on C9 protein in the MAC complex may interact
with receptors or glycans at the surface of encountering pathogens.

The third type of glycosylation harbored on C9 is C-mannosylation. This less common glycosylation has been previously
found to occur on C9 using MS, Edman degradation, and nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR).22 It was already known
that the N-terminal type-1 TSP domain of C9 can be
modified with two mannoses. Here, we report data supporting these
findings. While in human C9 W27 is 100% occupied, W30 is C-mannosylated in only ∼23% of the C9.

All these PTMs
are covalently attached to the backbone sequence
of C9. Our native MS data provided additional information regarding
the noncovalent binding of Ca2+ to C9. The only direct
experimental proof about the binding of Ca2+ by intact
C9 was reported two decades ago through the use of plasma emission
spectroscopy. It was determined that C9 binds one Ca2+ ion
per molecule with a dissociation constant of ∼3 μM at
physiological pH and ionic strength.43 Here,
we confirm the findings of that earlier report. Notably, standard
bottom-up/middle-down proteomics approaches are not capable of identifying
metal ion binding, due to the fact that such analyses happen under
denaturing conditions. Our data indicate that C9 can possibly bind
up to two Ca2+ ions. The exact site of Ca2+ binding
in C9 has not been identified yet; nevertheless, one of the possible
candidate sites is located at cysteine-rich LDLRA domain of C9.43 Another possible Ca2+ binding site
is at the C9 N-terminal part, which also harbors O-glycosylation sites. The 12 N-terminal
amino acids of C9 exhibit a strong negative charge, and the 16 N-terminal amino acids contain a consensus sequence for
Ca2+ binding proteins.25 As
mentioned above, the N-terminal region of C9, located
at the outside of the MAC (Figure 4d,e), has been shown to play a significant role in
C9 polymerization, hinting at a possible regulating role of the here
identified O-glycosylation and Ca2+ binding
in the assembly of the MAC or interactions with some other molecules
or receptors.

In conclusion, here, we provide an unbiased detailed
specification
of three different types of glycosylation on C9 isolated from human
blood serum and quantification and validation of 15 C9 proteoforms.
In total, we achieved more than 90% correlation between the native
MS data and peptide centric data. Mapping all sites of modifications
on a structural model of C9, as present in the MAC, hints at their
putative roles in pore formation or receptor interactions. In general,
the applied combination of MS methods represents a powerful tool for
the in-depth analysis of plasma proteins and thus may advance biomarker
discovery.
