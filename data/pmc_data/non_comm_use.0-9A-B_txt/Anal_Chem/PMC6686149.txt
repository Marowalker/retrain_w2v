Mass
spectrometry has proven itself to be an important technology
for characterizing intact glycoproteins, glycopeptides, and released
glycans. However, these molecules often present significant challenges
during analysis. For example, glycans of identical molecular weights
can be present in many isomeric forms, with one form having dramatically
more biological activity than the others. Discriminating among these
isomeric forms using mass spectrometry alone can be daunting, which
is why orthogonal techniques, such as ion mobility spectrometry, have
been explored. Here, we demonstrate the use of differential mobility
spectrometry (DMS) to separate isomeric glycans differing only in
the linkages of sialic acid groups (e.g., α 2,3 versus α
2,6). This ability extends from a small trisaccharide species to larger
biantennary systems and is driven, in part, by the role of intramolecular
solvation of the charge site(s) on these ions within the DMS environment.

==== Body
Glycosylation,
a post-translational
modification found on more than half of all human proteins,1−4 can induce complex changes in both the structure and function of
proteins. Glycan structures are highly variable, and even slight changes
to anomeric configuration, monomer stereochemistry, or inter-residue
linkage have been shown to have dramatic biological repercussions.5−8 Therefore, there is a strong desire to gain a more complete understanding
of the forms of glycosylation present on proteins, especially in the
burgeoning class of monoclonal antibody-based drugs.9 However, the high level of complexity found in protein
glycosylation makes its characterization extremely challenging.

The sialic acid monosaccharide group has particularly important
functions in many physiological and pathological processes, including
pathogen binding and regulation of the immune response.10 This is mediated by their almost exclusively
terminal nature, typically found at the outermost ends of glycan chains.
In human cells, the linkage position of a sialic acid to a glycan
side chain can be α2,3 or α2,6 to a galactose residue,
α2,6 to a N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue, or α2,8
to another sialic acid residue.11,12 The sialic acid linkage
configuration has important consequences for biological function,
for example, upregulation of α2,6 sialic acid via the sialyl
Tn antigen is highly associated with a wide range of cancers, and
a shift to expression of the α2,3 linked sialic acid can indicate
metastasis in certain cancers.13 For the
development of biopharmaceuticals, characterization of sialylation
is essential for determination of function and efficacy.9

Mass spectrometry (MS), a very useful technique
for characterization
of protein glycosylation,14,15 necessarily relies
on orthogonal front-end techniques for the separation of isobaric
and isomeric glycosylation products. Many of these species have identical
molecular weights (m/z values) and,
when fragmented in an MS/MS experiment, yield almost identical fragment
ion patterns. The relative intensities of these fragments can sometimes
differ between isomeric glycan ions, but when analyzed as a mixture,
the analytical utility of such ion ratios can be rendered futile.
While a wide range of glycan and glycopeptide isomers can be separated
using the traditional coupling of liquid chromatography (LC) to MS,
sialylated N-glycan α2,3 and α2,6 linkage isomers present
a significant LC challenge. Recent strategies to address this have
used linkage-specific derivatization,16−18 capillary electrophoresis,19 and specialized HILIC techniques, which still
maintained a derivatization element18,20 or involved
online processing21 in their workflows.

As an alternative to chromatographic and electrophoretic technologies,
ion mobility techniques are being investigated as a means of separation
for isobaric glycans and glycopeptides.22−37 However, only three studies to date have focused on the differentiation
of α2,3- from α2,6-sialylation,27,31,36 and all of these utilized traveling-wave
ion mobility spectrometry (TWIMS). While small isomeric glycans exhibit
drift times that allow for differentiation,27,31 only partial separation has been afforded for larger biantennary
species.36

In this study, we explore
the potential of using differential mobility
spectrometry (DMS)38−42 (also known as high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility (FAIMS))
to differentiate sialic acid linkage isomers. In these experiments,
chemical modifiers can be added to the DMS cell to enhance the degree
of separation. In DMS experiments, ions are carried between two planar,
parallel electrodes to which is applied a radio frequency asymmetric
voltage (separation voltage or SV). This establishes dynamic high-
and low-electric field conditions,40 and
as the SV is increased, ions begin to acquire “zig-zag”
trajectories of larger amplitude as they traverse the DMS cell. This
off-axis component to the trajectory increases nonlinearly with increasing
SV. To bring their flight paths back on axis for successful sampling
by a mass spectrometer, ions require a dc compensation voltage (CV)
to provide this restorative trajectory. Subsequent to DMS separation,
further verification of the isomeric forms may be conducted by tandem
mass spectrometry using either diagnostic fragment ions or fragmentation
patterns (if the glycan structures allow). In this study, we aimed
to assess the capability of DMS-MS to separate α2,3 and α2,6
sialylated glycan isomers, and to employ molecular modeling tools
to present hypotheses that explain differences between the isomers
in their observed DMS behaviors.

Methods
Sample Preparation
Three α2,3 and α2,6
sialic acid-containing isomer pairs were analyzed in this study (Figure 1). Two of the pairs,
depicted in Figure 1A and B, were purchased from Dextra Laboratories (Reading, UK). The
larger isomer pair (Figure 1C) was purchased from TheraProteins (Barcarena, Portugal).
For ease of reference, the glycan compositions of the isomer pairs
are given in terms of the numbers of hexose (H), N-acetylhexosamine (N), fucose (F), and N-acetylneuraminic
acid (S) units. The working ESI solutions of these glycans were prepared
in acetonitrile and water (20/80, v/v) containing 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate,
to concentrations of 1–25 μg/mL. Isomeric glycans were
analyzed individually to assess their characteristic DMS behaviors
(vide supra) and also to identify any unique MS/MS fragmentation patterns.
The same isomer pairs were also analyzed as mixtures to evaluate the
DMS separation of these pairings.

DMS-MS Instrumentation
Experiments
were performed using
either a QTRAPⓇ 6500 or a QTRAPⓇ 6500+ hybrid triple quadrupole–linear ion trap mass spectrometer
(qLIT) (SCIEX, Concord, ON, Canada) (Figure 2A and B). Each instrument was equipped with
a SelexIONⓇ differential mobility spectrometer (DMS)
device (SCIEX) (Figure 2A), the fundamental properties of which have been described elsewhere.38,41,42 The DMS cell was mounted between
the sampling orifice of the mass spectrometer and a Turbo V ion source
(ESI voltage of −4200 V). The temperature of the DMS cell was
maintained at 150 °C, with nitrogen curtain gas operated at 30
psi. Chemical modifier (methanol) was added into the curtain gas flow
at 1.5% or 3.0% (mole ratio). The DMS cell also featured a jet injector
modification45 designed to improve transmission
of ions by mitigating the effects of RF fringing fields and diffusional
losses at the entrance of the DMS cell.

(A) the DMS cell coupled to (B) a hybrid triple
quadrupole-linear ion trap MS system employed in this study.

For DMS infusion experiments,
SV was stepped from 0 to 4500 V in
increments of 200 to 1000 V. At each value of SV, CV was scanned from
−10 V to +30 V in 0.2-V steps. At each value of CV, either
multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) data (Table 1; H2S1, H1N1S1) or full scan enhanced product
ion (EPI) MS/MS (H5N4F1S2) data were acquired for the glycan isomers.
The resulting plots reveal the optimal CV at which the ion is transmitted
through the DMS cell at a particular value of SV. If optimal CV is
plotted against SV to create a “dispersion plot”,46 the curvature of the SV/CV plot can describe
the behavior exhibited by the ion within the DMS cell.39,47,48

To enhance
the DMS separation of the isomeric pairs of glycans,
we employed resolving (throttle) gas41—added
at the terminus of the DMS cell (Figure 2A)—that serves to increase the residence
times for the ions within the DMS cell. This leads to narrower CV
profiles for ions and higher resolution for the DMS measurements.
After determination of optimal CV values for DMS-separated glycan
isomers, CV values can be fixed to allow the acquisition of full scan
MS/MS data for each isomer.

Linear ion trap MS/MS spectra (enhanced
product ion, or EPI, scans)
of individual glycan isomers were collected using the Q3 of the mass
spectrometer (Figure 2B) and yielded specific ions that were either diagnostic for, or
more abundant in, the α2,6 glycan isomer. For H2S1 and H1N1S1,
these ions were utilized for the design of isomer-specific MRM transitions.
For H5N4F1S2, the presence (or absence) of these ions in the linear
ion trap MS/MS spectra of separated glycan pairs was used to confirm
that the α2,3 had indeed been isolated from the α2,6 form.

All data were processed using an in-house, research-grade version
of PeakViewⓇ software (SCIEX).

Computational
Chemistry
The energy-optimized structures
and ion/molecule binding energies were obtained by first constructing
the glycan structures using a GLYCAM-Web Carbohydrate builder (www.glycam.org),49 which employed an AMBER MM force field optimization. An
additional geometry optimization using these AMBER-optimized structures
as starting points was performed using the PM7 method50 as implemented in Gaussian 16.51 We selected the PM7 method given its ability to calculate intra-
and intermolecular hydrogen bond energies with reasonable accuracy
despite their lower computational costs compared to density functional
theory.50 To determine an estimate for
the anion/methanol binding energy for each glycan, we calculated the
optimized geometries and energies for each unsolvated anion (without
any methanol molecules present), for each anion solvated with methanol
(one methanol molecule per charge site), and a lone methanol molecule
in isolation. An estimate of each glycan’s ion/methanol binding
energy was calculated by subtracting the energies of the unsolvated
anion and the isolated methanol molecule(s) from the energy of the
solvated anion. A comparison of relative anion–methanol binding
energies allows us to compare the impact of solvation on these species
and any correlations of this property on the DMS separations observed.
Structures were visualized using GaussView 16.52

Results and Discussion
DMS Separates Sialic Acid
Linkage Isomers—Trisaccharides
H2S1 and H1N1S1
Given the successes of earlier ion mobility-based
studies that showed some separation of α2,3 and α2,6 Neu5Ac
linked glycan isomers,27,31,36 we initiated this DMS-based study to explore its capability to perform
the same separations. As mentioned previously, DMS has been used to
distinguish isomeric ions,47,48,53−61 including glycans24 and glycopeptides.26 For the analysis of the trisaccharide isomers
(as well as the other sialylated glycans in this study), we operated
the DMS-MS system in negative mode assuming the carboxylic acid groups
of the sialic acid moieties would deprotonate easily. Also, having
some foreknowledge about the sites of deprotonation (i.e., charging)
of these ions aids in our computational analyses of these DMS experiments.
For example, it has been shown that ions’ sites of charging
are the focal points of the ion/molecule clustering events so critical
to establishing unique DMS behavior for ions, allowing for their separation
in compensation voltage (CV).47,62

Initially, we
infused a mixture of the two isomeric H2S1 trisaccharides (Figure 1a) into the ESI source,
generating deprotonated forms of both isomer. These isomeric ions
were then sampled by the DMS using only nitrogen as the carrier gas.
With the SV set to 4500 V and resolving gas set at high, we observed
marginal separation of the two isomers in CV space (Figure 3A) as the CV was ramped (x-axis of Figure 3A). The blue trace marks the response for the MRM transition
of 632.2/290.1 (common to both isomers). However, the pink and red
MRM traces (632.2/470.2 and 632.2/572.3) are predominantly observed
for the α2,6 isomer (verified by independent analysis of that
isomer). These traces reveal that the α2,6 isomer is transmitted
at the more positive CV (∼10.3 V) than the α2,3 variant
(∼9.4 V). The H2S1 α2,3 and α2,6 isomers produce
different relative amounts of two large sialic acid containing fragments
(Figure 3C and 3D): the m/z 572.18
cross-ring Glc fragment and m/z 470.15
c fragment are of much greater abundance in the α2,6 isomer.
Although these fragments are not specific to the α2,6 isomer,
the α2,6 linked sialic acid is less labile than the α2,3
linked sialic acid, making it more likely that larger fragments containing
sialic acid are produced.63

Figure 3 Separation of deprotonated
sialylated glycans H2S1 using DMS. The
blue trace was obtained during the analysis of the mixture of the
two isomers, while the red and pink traces were produced during the
analysis of only the H2S1 isomer. While minimal separation is observed
when the DMS is operated at SV = 4500 V using nitrogen alone as the
carrier gas (A), the α2,3 and α2,6 sialic acid-linked
isomers were fully separated when methanol was added to the carrier
gas. Full scan MS/MS spectra (collision energy = 45 eV, lab frame
for both spectra) obtained using the SV and CoV settings for full
separation, show different fragment patterns for the α2,3 (C)
and the α2,6 isomers (D). Note, the presence of a α2,6
isomer-specific 0,4A2-CO2 fragment at m/z 306 (D).

Since these initial DMS conditions did not separate the glycan
isomers, we altered the chemical environment of the DMS cell by adding
volatile polar molecules to the carrier gas. This serves to probe
any subtle differences in how the isomeric ions might differently
cluster with these volatile molecules. Different interactions for
the isomers can yield different optimal CVs that provide better separation
than nitrogen alone. In this case for the H2S1 sialic acid isomers,
we introduced methanol vapor into the DMS cell, and this induced different
optimal CV shifts and baseline separation of the α2,3 and α2,6
isomers (Figure 3B).
Another important consequence of the use of chemical modifiers is
that isomer separation for these smaller glycans in the presence of
methanol requires lower settings of resolution gas, which itself can
drop the ion signal during its use.41

Besides observing MRM transitions for these H2S1 isomers, we also
collected full-scan MS/MS spectra (collected at the same collision
energy (lab frame) of 45 eV) for the DMS-separated α2,3 and
α2,6 isomers (Figure 3C and D). Here, we observed differences in the fragmentation
patterns of the two isomers (e.g., the α2,6 isomer-specific 0,4A2-CO2 fragment at m/z 306)64 that provided
further confirmation on the isomer separation provided by the DMS
technology.

Structural Significance of the Compensation
Voltage Ordering
of the Glycan Isomers
Based upon the findings of previous
studies,47,48,54 the more negative
CV shift exhibited for the α2,3 isomer of the H2S1 pair suggests
that the ion/molecule binding energy between this anion and methanol
is stronger than for the α2,6 isomer. We probed this theory
further by calculating the relative binding energies of each glycan
isomer with methanol, and indeed, we calculated a stronger binding
energy for the α2,3 isomer (vide infra). In addition, the baseline
separation displayed in Figure 3B was obtained at a SV setting of 4500 V, which was employed
to highlight the maximum separation power of this DMS system. A lower
SV setting (e.g., 4000 V or less) should also be sufficient to provide
adequate analytical separation of these two species and would yield
a slightly more intense signal for these molecules. Again, the separation
of the isomers was confirmed by the presence of the α2,6-specific
species at the more positive CV. These findings are depicted in the
dispersion plots of Figure 4, which display the separation of the isomers’ signals
in SV and CV space as well as the different minimum CVs acquired by
each isomer. Again, one can observe that optimal CVs for the α2,3
isomer are much more negative than the α2,6 isomer at SV values
greater than 2500 V.

Figure 4 Dispersion plots (CV versus SV response) for two H2S1
isomers analyzed
with the DMS cell’s carrier gas doped with 1.5% methanol. The
more negative CV for the α2,3 isomer reveals a stronger binding
interaction between these ions and methanol than for the α2,6
isomers. Error bars represent the full width at half-maximum for each
CV measurement (∼3.0 V).

We next ionized a mixture of the two isomeric H1N1S1 trisaccharides
(Figure 1b) to evaluate
the ability of DMS to separate these species. Figure 5A displays the separation in CV space that
the DMS provided using only nitrogen as the carrier gas. Here, in
contrast to the H2S1 results, we observed separation of the two isomers,
again verified by the presence of α2,6-isomer specific MS/MS
fragments64 being transmitted at a unique
CV (+8.6 V in this case). Interestingly, while this glycan pair differs
from the H2S1 isomer pair only by the added N-acetyl group on the
Glc moiety, there was a notable “reversal” in the order
of transmission of the isomers in the DMS (i.e., the α2,6 isomer
was transmitted at a more negative CV than the α2,3 isomer).
The reason for this switch is presently under investigation. Figure 5A displays the MRM
traces detected for these isomers: the blue trace marks the response
for the MRM transition of 673.2/290.1 (common to both isomers) while
the pink MRM trace (673.2/572.3) is provided predominantly by the
α2,6 isomer (again, this was verified by independent analysis
of that isomer).

Figure 5 Separation of the deprotonated sialylated glycans H1N1S1
using
DMS. The α2,3 and α2,6-sialylated isomers were fully separated
when pure nitrogen (A) or methanol-doped nitrogen (B) was used as
the carrier gas. However, a higher setting of resolution gas was needed
to separate the isomers in the absence of methanol (resolution gas
set to medium (A), or low (B)) Full scan MS/MS, obtained using the
SV and CoV settings for full separation, shows different fragment
patterns for the α2,3 (C) and the α2,6 isomers (D). Note,
the presence of a α2,6 isomer-specific 0,4A2-CO2 fragment at m/z 306 (D).

However, just like the H2S1 analogues
(Figure 3), when we
added methanol to the carrier
gas of the DMS cell, the α2,3 isomer of the H1N1S1 pair was
transmitted at a more negative CV than the α2,6 isomer (Figure 5B, same MRM traces
as A). This was consistent with the H2S1 isomer behavior and, again,
suggests stronger ion/molecule binding between the methanol molecules
and the α2,3 structure, which was verified by calculated binding
energies (vide infra). Like the H2S1 analyses, full-scan MS/MS fragmentation
patterns collected at the same collision energy (45 eV, lab frame)
verified the separation and identification of the individual isomers.64

DMS Separates Larger Sialic Acid Linkage
Isomers—Fucosylated
Disialylated Biantennary Glycans H5N4F1S2
Following the successful
separations of these two smaller glycan isomer pairs differing only
in their sialic acid linkages, the DMS behavior of a pair of doubly
deprotonated complex fucosylated disialylated biantennary glycans
(H5N4F1S2) was examined. When these species were subjected to ESI
in negative ion mode, they each produced abundant signals corresponding
to the doubly deprotonated ([M – 2H]2–) forms
of these molecules.63 Under nitrogen-only
conditions within the DMS cell, these two isomeric ions, both present
at m/z 1183.3, were inseparable
(data not shown). This led to the use of methanol to try to separate
these isomers in terms of CV by exploiting any difference in the binding
energies each ion exhibits with methanol molecules. These DMS conditions
did provide separation for this large glycan pair, again providing
a more negative CV for the doubly α2,3 sialylated isomer than
for its doubly α2,6 sialylated analogue (Figure 6A). This separation also required the use
of high SV (4000 V or greater), as well as the use of resolving gas
(30 psi), which increases ion residence time (and resolution of DMS
measurements).41 In addition, corresponding
CID MS/MS data (collision energy = 60 eV, lab frame) allowed differentiation
of the α2,3 from the α2,6 isomer based on diagnostic fragment
ions (Figure 6B and
C).64

Figure 6 Separation of a pair of doubly deprotonated
complex fucosylated
disialylated biantennary glycans, H5N4F1S2 (A) using DMS with methanol
in the carrier gas; the signal monitored is the total ion current
resulting from the full-scan MS/MS analysis of both isomers as a function
of CV. These full scan MS/MS spectra (B, C), obtained at CV = +10
V and CV = +11.5 V (respectively) show different fragmentation patterns,
including α2,6-isomer-specific fragment ions at m/z 306 (0,4A2-CO2 ion) and 655 (B3 ion) in the spectrum C.

The more challenging conditions required for the
DMS separation
of the H5N4F1S2 isomers is echoed in another example in the literature
of ion mobility separation of similar glycan isomers. Using TWIMS,
Barroso and co-workers36 also performed
extensive parameter optimization to yield only partial separation
of nonfucosylated H5N4S2 isomers; the addition of a fucose unit to
these species resulted in their complete convolution. In our study,
we were able to obtain separation of these differentially sialylated
glycans by exploiting the differences in how each of these species
bind to methanol molecules in the gas phase. While these differences
in DMS behavior could be indicative of relative differences between
the physicochemical properties of these isomers,48,54 further studies into these and several other glycan isomers must
be conducted.

Computational Chemistry Reveals Details about
the DMS Separation
of the Sialic Acid Linkage Isomers
The calculated methanol/glycan
binding energies for each isomer supported the difference in CV shifts
experienced by each ion. As expected, the isomer that is more strongly
bound to two molecules of methanol (one each at the sialic acid sites)
was the doubly α2,3 sialylated isomer by −6.25 kcal/mol.
The structures are depicted in Figure 7C and 7D. This calculated outcome
mirrored that for the smaller H1N1S1 isomers, with the α2,3
isomer binding −3.6 kcal/mol more strongly to methanol than
the α2,6 analogue (structures depicted in Figure 7A and B), with the α2,3 isomer also
exhibiting a more negative CV than the α2,6 pair.48,54 The same finding was determined upon calculations of the ion/methanol
binding energies for the H2S1 isomer pairs, with the α2,3 isomer
binding a molecule of methanol some −10.4 kcal/mol more strongly
that the α2,6 isomer. While these trends support previous DMS
studies that relate ion/molecule binding energies to relative CV shifts
for isomeric sets,48,54,65 more comprehensive and higher-level computational evaluations of
these structures are presently underway to provide the most accurate
assessment of this property.

Conclusions
In
this study, differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) was used
to analyze pairs of mono- and disialylated glycan isomers. With the
addition of methanol chemical modifier to the DMS, the α2,3
sialylated isomer was successfully separated from the α2,6 form
(including separation of a doubly α2,3 silaylated isomer from
its doubly α2,6 sialylated form) in all three isomer pairs studied,
despite the varying sizes of the glycans. In addition, a more negative
CV value was consistently observed for the α2,3 form than for
the α2,6 form, which correlates with the stronger methanol binding
energies calculated for the α2,3 isomers versus their α2,6
forms. The use of DMS to distinguish differentially sialylated glycan
forms was effective with all species studied, and the trends observed
show considerable promise for a wider range of sialylated glycan isomers.
