An untargeted metabolomics workflow
for the detection of metabolites
derived from endogenous or exogenous tracer substances is presented.
To this end, a recently developed stable isotope-assisted LC–HRMS-based
metabolomics workflow for the global annotation of biological samples
has been further developed and extended. For untargeted detection
of metabolites arising from labeled tracer substances, isotope pattern
recognition has been adjusted to account for nonlabeled moieties conjugated
to the native and labeled tracer molecules. Furthermore, the workflow
has been extended by (i) an optional ion intensity ratio check, (ii)
the automated combination of positive and negative ionization mode
mass spectra derived from fast polarity switching, and (iii) metabolic
feature annotation. These extensions enable the automated, unbiased,
and global detection of tracer-derived metabolites in complex biological
samples. The workflow is demonstrated with the metabolism of 13C9-phenylalanine in wheat cell suspension cultures
in the presence of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON). In total, 341
metabolic features (150 in positive and 191 in negative ionization
mode) corresponding to 139 metabolites were detected. The benefit
of fast polarity switching was evident, with 32 and 58 of these metabolites
having exclusively been detected in the positive and negative modes,
respectively. Moreover, for 19 of the remaining 49 phenylalanine-derived
metabolites, the assignment of ion species and, thus, molecular weight
was possible only by the use of complementary features of the two
ion polarity modes. Statistical evaluation showed that treatment with
DON increased or decreased the abundances of many detected metabolites.

Untargeted
metabolomics approaches
probe the entire metabolic space of a biological system (e.g., cells
or whole organism). This can be realized by trying to measure as many
metabolites as possible or alternatively by searching for those metabolites
that arise from either exogenous or endogenous substances such as
toxins, drugs, or sugars and amino acids, respectively. The screening
of such metabolites in LC–HRMS data is rather straightforward
when performed in (a) a targeted way with positive lists of putative
biotransformation products (e.g., Levsen et al.,1 Sandermann2). In contrast, untargeted
approaches are usually more challenging and aim at the detection of
known and unknown metabolic products by (b) background subtraction
and/or statistical investigation (e.g., Zhang et al.3) or (c) isotopic labeling, including stable isotopic labeling
(SIL)-assisted approaches. Although the search according to approach
a is limited to the subset of predicted, putative tracer derived conjugates
(e.g., sugars, amino acids, small peptides) or degradation products
known from literature and previous approaches, approach b also enables
detecting previously unknown metabolites, but also requires more sophisticated
data processing than approach a. Furthermore, the latter approach
is prone to detect non-tracer-related metabolites, significantly differing
between the investigated sample types. In contrast, approach c provides
an easy way to detect both known and unknown tracer-derived metabolites
and has the advantage over both a and b that the detected metabolites
can be linked to the studied tracer substance (e.g., Baillie,4 Iglesias et al.5).

To avoid the use of radioisotopes, SIL-assisted metabolism studies
use stable isotope (e.g., 13C, 15N, or 34S)-enriched tracers and assume that biological systems metabolize
native and labeled variants of a supplied tracer nearly equally.6 Cabaret and colleagues7 studied U-13C sterigmatocystin in porcine tracheal epithelial
cells, and Li and colleagues8 utilized
deuterium labeling together with a principal component analysis guided
approach to detect novel metabolites of the drug tempol.

For
GC/MS-based, untargeted tracer metabolism studies, Hiller and
colleagues9 presented the NTFD (nontargeted
tracer fate detection) algorithm, which detects changes and metabolic
fluxes derived from labeled tracers in the primary metabolome. For
LC–HRMS-based tracer metabolization approaches, several software
tools designed for the untargeted detection and analysis of isotope
patterns of metabolites derived from native and partly isotopically
labeled tracers are available (e.g., mzMatch-ISO,10 X13CMS11). However,
to the best of our knowledge, no tools for the automated global and
highly selective detection of only those metabolites derived from
native and labeled tracers with nonoverlapping isotope patterns are
currently available.

Thus, a LC–HRMS-based workflow for
the unbiased detection
of known and unknown metabolites derived from U-13C-SIL
guided tracer metabolism was developed. It is based on our recently
published workflow for the detection of metabolic features derived
from native and fully labeled biological samples,12 which has been further developed to support fast polarity
switching and automated annotation of metabolic features of the detected
metabolites. In contrast, to the currently existing workflows, such
as mzMatch-ISO or fluxomics applications, which have been designed
to detect shifts of relative abundances in native isotope patterns,
the presented approach requires distinct, nonoverlapping isotope patterns
and is capable of detecting metabolites for which the native and labeled
analogues differ by ≥4 u. Therefore, it is mainly suited to
study the secondary metabolism of a biological system of interest
rather than to support the elucidation of primary metabolism. Moreover,
the use of nonoverlapping isotope patterns enables determining the
exact number of incorporated carbon atoms of the employed tracer in
the respective biotransformation product and thus improves sum formula
and metabolite annotation. At a less advanced stage, the presented
concept has already been used successfully to study the metabolic
fate of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) in wheat (Triticum aestivum, Kluger et al.13) and the fate of the aromatic amino acid phenylalanine
in grape berries (Vitis vinifera, Chassy
et al.14). Here, our approach is presented
with the metabolism of the endogenous amino acid phenylalanine in
wheat cell suspension cultures in the presence or absence of the Fusarium virulence factor DON. Phenylalanine was
chosen as a tracer because it serves as precursor for the biosynthesis
of hydroxycinnamic acids, phenylpropanoids, and flavonoids in plants,
many of which are known to be involved in the defense against fungal
pathogens such as Fusarium.15

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
Acetonitrile
(ACN, HiPerSolv Chromanorm,
HPLC gradient grade) was purchased from VWR (Vienna, Austria), methanol
(MeOH, LiChrosolv, LC gradient grade) was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt,
Germany), and formic acid (FA, MS grade) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(Vienna, Austria). Water was purified successively by reverse osmosis
and an ELGA Purelab Ultra-AN-MK2 system (Veolia Water, Vienna, Austria).
U-13C9 phenylalanine (U-13C9 Phe; 99.1% 13C) was purchased from Euriso-top (Saarbrücken,
Germany).

Figure 1 Illustration of the workflow for SIL-assisted tracer metabolism
studies, including LC–ESI-HRMS fast polarity switching.

Biological Experiment (Figure 1, Step
1)
Aliquots (3.6 mL) of T. aestivum (Tae) cell suspension cultures in
B5 medium (Supporting Information S1.1)
were incubated with 400 μL of aqueous solutions differing in
composition according to the three tested conditions (3 replicates
per condition). Thus, each culture sample resulted in a final volume
of 4 mL. For the condition “control”, 200 μL of
U-13C9 Phe stock solution (final concentration
in culture: 25 mg/L) and 200 μL of H2O dist. were
added to the culture. For cocultivation with DON (condition “treatment”),
200 μL of U-13C9 Phe stock solution (final
concentration in culture: 25 mg/L) and 200 μL of DON stock solution
(final concentration in culture: 90 mg/L) were added. For the condition
“blank” 400 μL of H2O dist. was added
to 3.6 mL of cell suspension culture. All Tae cell suspension cultures were grown in 25 mL Erlenmeyer flasks for
8 days at 20 °C in the light with shaking (100 rpm). In addition,
two medium blanks without cell suspension cultures were prepared in
parallel.

Sample Preparation
After cultivation, 2 mL of each
sample was transferred into savelock Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged
for 5 min at 5000g. The weight of each cell pellet
was determined, and 350 μL MeOH and 2 × 5 mm steel balls
were added prior to wet milling with a ball mill (MM 301 Retsch, Haan,
Germany). Samples were homogenized for 2 min at 30 Hz, and the suspension
was transferred to new Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged for 5 min at
20 000g. From the resulting extract, 200 μL
was mixed with 200 μL of H2O dist. and centrifuged
for 10 min at 20 000g again. An aliquot of
300 μL of this sample solution was transferred to an HPLC vial
and stored at −80 °C until further analysis.

LC–HRMS
Analysis (Figure 1, Step
2)
All samples were analyzed on a UHPLC system (UltiMate
3000, Dionex) coupled to an Orbitrap Exactive Plus (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) equipped with a heated electrospray ionization (ESI) source.
A Dionex autosampler was used for the injection of 10 μL per
sample for chromatographic separation at 25 °C on a reversed-phase
XBridge C18 150 × 2.1 mm i.d., 3.5 μm column (Waters, Milford,
MA, USA) preceded by a C18 4 × 3 mm i.d. security cartridge (Phenomenex,
Torrance, CA, USA). At a constant flow rate of 250 μL/min, a
linear gradient program with water containing 0.1% FA (v/v) (eluent
A) and MeOH containing 0.1% FA (v/v) was employed;12 the initial mobile phase composition (10% eluent B) was
held constant for 2 min, followed by a linear gradient to 100% eluent
B within 30 min. After a hold time of 5 min, the column was re-equilibrated
for 8 min at 10% eluent B.

The heated ESI interface was operated
in fast polarity-switching mode using the following settings for both
polarities: sheath gas, 50 au; auxiliary gas, 5 au; capillary voltage,
3 kV; capillary temperature, 350 °C. FT-Orbitrap was operated
in profile mode (scan range, m/z 100–1000) with a resolving power of 70 000 fwhm (at m/z 200) and automatic gain control setting
of 3 × 106 with a maximum injection time of 200 ms.

SIL-Assisted Data Processing (Figure 1, Steps
3 and 4)
The SIL-assisted data processing for metabolite
detection in full metabolome labeling experiments described earlier12 was extended to support the detection of tracer-derived
metabolites. It is part of a software package that is currently under
development and will comprise three different data processing workflows
for SIL-assisted metabolomics approaches. In the meantime, the software
module facilitating data processing according to the presented workflow
is accessible via the corresponding author.

Each of the following
data processing steps for metabolic feature detection is carried out
independently for the positive and negative ionization mode: First,
every MS scan is inspected for pairs of two mass peaks, M, which corresponds
to a native metabolization product, and M′, which denotes the
same metabolization product but contains the labeled tracer molecule
or a part of it, with an m/z difference
proportional to the number of tracer-derived heavy isotope atoms (here, 13C) present in the labeled metabolite ion (step 3a). A peak
pair is accepted if the observed mass difference is within a preset
maximum mass tolerance window of that calculated for the algorithm-predicted
number of heavy isotopes. Optionally, for exogenous tracers, the intensity
ratio IM:IM′ is compared with that of the concentration ratio of native and labeled
tracer used for sample incubation (step 3b).

Next, the observed
isotopolog ratio IM′–1/IM′ is compared with its theoretical
ratio expected from the number of labeling isotopes contained in the
inspected metabolite ion (step 3a). The corrected intensity ratio
of the isotopologs IM+1/IM – IM′+1/IM′, which accounts for any carbon atom in the
nonlabeled moiety, is compared with its theoretical ratio as determined
for the number of labeling isotopes of the respective M and M′
ion pair. All intensity ratio checks are passed if the relative deviation
between the expected and the observed ion intensity ratios are within
preset error windows. Then, all such detected M and M′ pairs
from different scans are combined with hierarchical clustering using
the assigned number of heavy isotopes per metabolite ion and the m/z value of M. Clusters showing a maximum
relative mass deviation between their highest and lowest m/z value of less than a preset threshold in parts
per million are not further split.

Next, for each M and M′
ion cluster, chromatographic peaks
in the corresponding 12C/13C EICs are extracted
with the wavelet algorithm of Du et al.16(step 3c). Only those EIC peaks that are found for both 12C and corresponding 13C m/z traces closely coelute and have a high Pearson correlation coefficient
remain for further data processing. Incorrectly detected M and M′
pairs that originate from carbon isotopologs (e.g., M + 1 instead
of M or M′ – 1 instead of M′) are removed from
the data (step 3d). Correctly assigned chromatographic peak pairs
are finally listed as metabolic features, each consisting of a 12C monoisotopic m/z for
M, a retention time (tR), feature areas
determined for the EIC peaks of M and M′, and the number of
heavy isotopes originating from the tracer.

Following metabolic
feature detection, all features found in positive
or negative ionization mode are combined across both ionization polarities
to generate feature groups, each of which represents a distinct metabolite
(step 3e). To this end, the Pearson correlation coefficient is calculated
pairwise for closely coeluting metabolic features. All metabolic features
with a correlation coefficient above a preset threshold are put into
the same feature group.

Subsequently, each determined feature
group is annotated (step
4). For this, all features of a feature group are inspected pairwise
for m/z differences corresponding
to predicted ion species frequently found for the respective ionization
mode. For metabolic features without a valid adduct pairing, neutral
losses are calculated according to the Seven Golden Rules.17

LC–HRMS data derived from wheat
cell suspension culture
samples were processed as described above with the following parameter
settings: (step 3a) Isotopic carbon enrichment, 98.9% 12C; 99.1% 13C9-Phe; Δ m/z12C/13C, 1.00335 u; atom
counts, 6–9; minimum intensity threshold of putative M and
M′ signals, 50 000 counts; maximum mass deviation between
M and putatively corresponding M′ signals, ±3 ppm; maximum
isotopolog ratio error, 20%. (step 3c) EIC m/z width, ± 5 ppm; minimum correlation coefficients
between EIC peaks of M and M′, 0.75 for peak picking and 0.9
for feature grouping (step 3e). (step 4) Adducts used for feature
annotation, [M + H]+, [M + Na]+, [M + NH4]+, [M + K]+, [M – e]+, [M – H]−, [M + FA – H]−, [M + Na – 2H]−, [M + Cl]−, [M + K – 2H]−, [M + Br]−, [M – e – 2H]−. The accurate m/z values of all detected metabolites
were searched against a custom wheat metabolite database containing
1145 entries (max m/z difference
≤ 5 ppm). Statistical evaluation of the experiment is described
in Supporting Information S1.3.

Results
and Discussion
In a biological system, native and 13C-enriched substances
are metabolized by the same biological transformations and to a nearly
equal extent.6 As a result, all metabolites
derived from a mixture of native and 13C-labeled tracer
contain either the entire native or the enriched tracer or just a
part of it. In LC–HRMS, native metabolites and their corresponding 13C isotopologs perfectly coelute with highly similar chromatographic
peak shapes but can be easily distinguished by MS because of their
differing m/z values. The observed m/z shift between the native and the partly
tracer-labeled biotransformation product is proportional to the number
of atoms of the labeling isotope in the remaining part of the tracer
of the inspected metabolite ion. The presented workflow automatically
searches for these unique isotope patterns and returns a comprehensive
list of metabolic features, each corresponding to an ion of a metabolite
derived from the studied tracer. As long as the isotope patterns of
the tracer(s) incorporated in the respective metabolite can be separated,
the algorithm can detect all metabolic feature pairs of a biotransformation
product, including those isotopologs originating from the incorporation
of different tracer moieties. The SIL-derived isotope patterns provide
a high certainty that the detected metabolites are truly derived from
the studied tracer.

To demonstrate the workflow, the metabolic
fate of the amino acid
phenylalanine (Phe) was studied in Tae cell suspensions cultured in the presence of U-13C9 Phe in the culture medium. Processing of the acquired raw
data resulted in a total of 341 metabolic features, which were convoluted
to 139 feature groups, each of which is representing a metabolite.
Figure 2a shows two mass spectra containing
a metabolism product with eight tracer-derived carbon atoms (native
M) and its partly 13C-labeled analog M′. The presence
of the M′ + 1 mass peaks indicate that the moiety conjugated
to the tracer also contains several carbon atoms.

Two medium
blanks and Tae cell suspension
cultures (no U-13C9 Phe added) were processed
as described above. Only 1–2 of incorrectly detected metabolic
features were found per sample, which during manual curation showed
to be Fourier transformation artifacts with low abundances and noisy
chromatographic peak shapes. This very low number of false positives
confirms the high selectivity of the presented SIL assisted approach.

the same metabolite. (a) Two mass spectra derived from positive and

a. (c) m/z versus retention time

in the positive and negative ionization mode and (d) their convolution

from three of the either annotated or identified metabolites. For
details, see Supporting Information S1.2.

Fast Polarity Switching
The presented
workflow supports
fully automated processing of LC–ESI-HRMS data employing fast
polarity switching. The cycle time for two successive MS scans (positive
and negative ionization mode) was ∼1 s, which is sufficient
to acquire 10–25 scans per chromatographic peak. As shown in
Figure 2b, the chromatographic peak shapes
are very similar for all four depicted mass traces (of Mp, Mp′, Mn, Mn′); thus,
even features originating from the same metabolite but recorded in
different ionization modes can be convoluted automatically into a
single feature group.

In the presented experiment, 150 and 191
metabolic features were detected in the positive and negative ionization
modes, respectively (Figure 2c). Furthermore,
feature grouping across the two ion polarity modes was carried out
successfully and resulted in a total of 139 distinct feature groups
(i.e., metabolites). Of those, 32 were exclusively found in the positive
mode, and 58 metabolites were detected in the negative ionization
mode only. In addition, 49 metabolites exhibited at least one metabolic
feature in each of the both ionization modes (Figure 2d). These findings underline the significant benefit that
has been gained with respect to metabolite coverage by integrating
positive and negative mode data.

Metabolite Annotation
The presented workflow results
in a list of metabolic features, each corresponding to a certain ion
species (e.g., adduct, deprotonated molecule, or in-source fragment)
of a metabolite. For 19 of the 49 detected phenylalanine-derived metabolites
with complementary adducts from both ionization modes, annotation
of their intact neutral molecule and, thus, the corresponding molecular
weight was achieved only by integration of ion species related information
from the respective opposite ionization mode. This further demonstrates
the power of fast polarity switching for complementary metabolite
annotation.

The database search revealed that 50 of the detected
metabolites, several with the same molecular mass, were putatively
annotated. Although metabolite annotation was not always unambiguous,
the metabolites could be assigned to phenylpropanoids (n = 14), phenylpropanoid amides (n = 9), and flavonoids
(n = 10), which are partly known to have antagonistic
effects against Fusarium infection
(Supporting Information S1.2). Detailed
metabolite annotation and biological interpretation of results will
be published elsewhere.

DON Treatment
After data processing
with the developed
workflow, hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) showed two distinct
clusters for the two conditions “control” and “treatment”.
Furthermore, the heatmap illustration indicates that the abundance
of many metabolites is either increased or decreased in the DON-treated
samples. This confirms that the DON treatment had a severe impact
on the cells metabolic composition (Supporting
Information S1.3).

Conclusion
In
recent years, SIL has been increasingly used in many fields
of targeted and untargeted metabolomics research. The presented SIL-assisted
LC–HRMS-based workflow is well suited to study the metabolic
fate of both endogenous and exogenous tracer substances. All metabolites
derived from the studied native and 13C-labeled tracers
show unique isotope patterns, which enable their untargeted detection
and provide high confidence that the detected metabolites are truly
derived from the studied tracer substance. The presented approach
is particularly suited for the investigation of secondary metabolism
and can be applied to virtually any biological system without the
need for extra equipment other than the labeled tracer compound(s).
As demonstrated for wheat cell suspension cultures, the use of ESI
in combination with fast polarity switching, the study of endogenous
plant secondary metabolite precursors (for example, phenylalanine)
directly results in a large number of complementary Phe-related metabolic
features, which can be assigned to various structure classes. In conclusion,
our data demonstrate the great potential of SIL-assisted workflows
for the comprehensive and highly selective untargeted screening and
annotation of metabolites truly derived from the studied tracer. The
workflow supports valuable applications across many different fields
of metabolomics research, such as drug, pesticide, toxin, or any other
secondary metabolite precursor-related conversion. A software tool
and technical assistance enabling the fully automated processing according
to the presented strategy are available from the corresponding author.
Moreover, this software tool will be published and made freely available
as part of an even more comprehensive software package for the evaluation
of SIL-derived metabolomics data in the near future.
