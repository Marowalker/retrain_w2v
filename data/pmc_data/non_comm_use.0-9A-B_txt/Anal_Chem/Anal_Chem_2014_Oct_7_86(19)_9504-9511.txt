Subambient
pressure ionization with nanoelectrospray (SPIN) has
proven to be effective in producing ions with high efficiency and
transmitting them to low pressures for increased sensitivity in mass
spectrometry (MS) analysis. Here we present evidence that the SPIN
source not only improves MS sensitivity but also facilitates the detection
of more labile compounds. The gentleness of conventional heated capillary
electrospray ionization (ESI) and the SPIN designs was compared in
conjunction with the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC–MS)
analysis of colominic acid and N-glycans containing sialic acid. Prior
experiments conducted with the SPIN interface demonstrated the ability
to detect labile glycans such as heavily sialylated and polysialic
acid N-glycans, which are difficult to detect with a conventional
ESI-MS interface. Colominic acid is a mixture of sialic acid polymers
of different lengths containing labile glycosidic linkages between
monomer units necessitating a gentle ion source. These labile covalent
bonds may display similar behavior to sialic acid chains in N-glycans
during MS analysis. By coupling the SPIN source with high-resolution
mass spectrometry and using advanced data processing tools, we demonstrate
much extended coverage of sialic acid polymer chains as compared to
conventional ESI-MS and the ability to detect sialic acid containing
N-glycans without the need of sample derivatization. In addition,
we show that SPIN-LC–MS is effective in elucidating polymer
features with high efficiency and high sensitivity previously unattainable
by the conventional ESI-LC–MS methods.

Electrospray
ionization (ESI)
is generally regarded as a soft ionization technique. However, in-source
fragmentation is typically observed for extremely labile compounds,
potentially limiting their identification and structural characterization.1,2 Although it is possible to “soften” the ESI source
by careful tuning of the ion optics’ voltages3−5 and lowering the temperature (e.g., of the heated capillary inlet)
of the ESI mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) interface,6−12 these changes generally result in significant losses of sensitivity
due to less effective desolvation. By altering these ion energy sensitive
parameters, any ESI source can also be tuned in either a soft condition
to reduce ion in-source fragmentation1 or
to provide harsher conditions to induce ion in-source fragmentation,
a preferable alternative in some applications to collision-induced
dissociation commonly obtained in an ion trap or a collision cell.13,14 For effective ESI-MS analysis of extremely labile compounds, a more
gentle ionization condition could prevent undesired in-source fragmentation
which can lead to misidentifications and losses in coverage of intact
labile compounds.2 A key challenge is doing
this while maintaining sufficient sensitivity for the characterization
of these compounds.

Subambient pressure ionization with nanoelectrospray
(SPIN) source
was developed in an attempt to eliminate the major ion losses in the
ESI-MS interface.15 In the SPIN source,
the ESI emitter is moved from the atmospheric pressure environment,
as used in any conventional ESI source design, into the first vacuum
stage of the mass spectrometer with its operating pressures typically
of 15–30 Torr. The ESI emitter in the SPIN source is positioned
at the entrance of an electrodynamic ion funnel allowing the entire
electrospray plume to be collected by the ion funnel. Significant
improvements in MS sensitivity using the SPIN source have been demonstrated
in our early studies as compared to using the standard atmospheric
pressure ESI interface which requires a small orifice or heated capillary
inlet.15,16 A parallel experimental evaluation has demonstrated
the ability of the SPIN source to transfer 50% of analyte molecules
in solution into the low-pressure regions of the mass spectrometer
as gas-phase ions.17 In addition to the
major improvement in MS sensitivity, glycan profiling studies using
the SPIN source also showed coverage increased by 25% for glycan families
in human serum when compared to using the conventional ESI with a
heated capillary/dual ion funnel interface.18 This significant increase in glycan coverage mostly came from the
detection of large heavily sialylated glycans, both extremely labile
and with relatively low ionization efficiency, that are not typically
detected by using the conventional heated capillary inlet ESI-MS interface
configuration.19−21 Many analytes were also detected with higher charge
states using the SPIN source.18 These studies
strongly hinted that the primary reason for the increase in identified
structural features was due to the decrease in undesirable in-source
fragmentation in the SPIN source.

To further probe this hypothesis,
we compared the structural features
identified from the analysis of known labile compounds using a conventional
ESI-MS interface and a SPIN-MS interface. As noted in a prior study,
heavily sialylated glycans and polysialic acid N-glycans were observed
in human serum with the SPIN-MS interface most of which were completely
absent with a ESI-dual ion funnel interface.18 These previous findings inspired our current study to perform a
systematic evaluation of the ionization conditions with different
MS interfaces operating at different conditions by using extremely
labile compounds of sialylated glycans and colominic acid. Colominic
acid is a polymer of particular interest because it is a mixture of
homopolymers of sialic acid with varying degrees of polymerizations
(DP) and the glycosidic bond being in proximity to the carboxylic
acid on sialic acid renders these compounds very labile and difficult
to analyze.22,23 For this reason, colominic acid
was first used as a model compound in this study to gain understanding
of the in-source fragmentation at different MS interface configurations.
Specifically, we compared the liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
(LC–MS) analysis of colominic acid and sialylated glycans between
a standard heated capillary ESI-MS interface operated at varying conditions
and the SPIN-MS interface while keeping the sample and LC conditions
constant. Conditions of the ESI-MS interface were initially tuned
for optimum sensitivity, and subsequently adjusted for a gentler ionization
condition by lowering the inlet capillary temperature and reducing
the tube lens voltage. High-resolution MS allowed comprehensive analysis
of polysialic acid and the unambiguous identification of polymer lengths
and structures. The SPIN source enabled the detection of colominic
acid compounds with higher DPs and intact sialylated glycans with
significantly reduced in-source fragmentation without any sacrifice
in MS sensitivity. In harmony with previous results, we also observed
a shift toward higher charge states, and the greatest gains in sensitivity
were observed for the compounds with the highest DP. The experimental
data presented in this report positively confirms for the first time
that the SPIN-MS interface provides gentler ionization conditions
than a conventional ESI-MS interface.

Experimental Section
Sample
Preparation
The sodium salt of colominic acid
from Escherichia coli was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Colominic acid samples were diluted
to a concentration of 660 μM, and 5 μL aliquots were loaded
onto a graphite column. Samples were desalted with nanopure water
(Barnstead Nanopure Infinity System, Dubuque, IA) on-column for 60
min prior to LC–MS analysis. A pooled reference human blood
serum sample was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (male, blood type AB,
not heat-inactivated) and prepared with a previously described method
to produce reduced nonderivatized glycans.18

High-Performance Liquid Chromatography
Separations
were performed on graphitized carbon columns packed in house with
3 μm Hypercarb particles (Thermo Fisher, Madison, WI) using
a fused-silica capillary, 75 μm i.d., 360 μm o.d., and
75 cm long (Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ). Solvents A and B
consisted of 0.1% formic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in nanopure
water and 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) in acetonitrile
(Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), respectively. The LC separation
was performed with a linear gradient from 30% to 60% solvent B provided
by an Agilent 1260 Series LC pump (Santa Clara, CA) over a period
of 100 min. Serum samples were loaded with 1% B solvent mixture, and
a 90 min gradient was used consisting of (time in minutes: % mobile
phase B) 0:1%, 1:4%, 2:6%, 91:30%, 95:95%, 96:95%, 100:1%.

Mass Spectrometry
Mass spectra were acquired on a Thermo
Orbitrap Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose,
CA). In the conventional atmospheric ESI source configuration a standard
heated capillary interface was used as illustrated in Figure 1a. The temperature of the heated capillary inlet
was adjusted from 150 to 300 °C, and the dc voltages on the tube
lens and skimmer were adjusted to achieve either optimal sensitivity
or ionization gentleness. The instrument was tuned using the LTQ Velos ESI positive ion calibration
solution (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). In the SPIN source configuration
the ESI emitter was moved to the first vacuum region of the mass spectrometer
and positioned at the entrance of the ion funnel.15,18 As depicted in Figure 1b, in this configuration
the standard ion optics up to lens L0 were replaced by two ion funnels
operating at different vacuum pressures. Independent of the source
configuration the instrument was always operated in ultrahigh-resolution
mode with an m/z range of 200–3000
with a 3 microscan average per spectrum. The AGC was set for high
dynamic range with a maximum ion injection time of 100 ms. Electrospray
emitters were fabricated by chemically etching fused-silica capillary
tubing with a 10 μm i.d. and 150 μm o.d. (Polymicro Technologies,
Phoenix, AZ) as described previously.24

the Exactive MS. The dual ion funnel interface replaces the ion optics

the first vacuum region of the MS.

Data Processing
The colominic acid and human serum
LC–MS data sets were processed with the Glycomics Quintavariate
Informed Quantification (GlyQ-IQ) software.25 Briefly, GlyQ-IQ is a targeted software package designed for searching
and identifying glycan features in LC–MS data sets. GlyQ-IQ
annotates glycans by using exact mass, modeled and fit isotope profiles,
modeled and fit extracted ion chromatograms, glycan family relationships,
and, if detected, in-source fragmentation information. A list of polysialic
acid masses was used to populate the glycan target list which includes
polymers with different degrees of polymerization extending from 2
to 50. Lactonized polysialic acid polymers were also included by including
lactone modifications on each glycosidic bond allowing for the condensation
reaction conversion to a lactone bond. For example, a polymer with
four sialic acids monosaccharides could contain zero, one, two, or
three lactone bonds. The formation of each lactone bond decreases
the molecular mass by 18.01 Da from a loss of water molecule. The
data was processed on a 48 node, 1504 core Microsoft Windows 2012
R2 HPC cluster utilizing AMD Interlagos CPUs (2.1Ghz) and an EMC Isilon
running the OneFS file system.

Results and Discussion
In order to evaluate the ionization gentleness of the SPIN source
and interface, a comparison of the polymer coverage from the LC–MS
analyses of colominic acid was conducted between the SPIN-MS and the
conventional heated capillary ESI-MS interfaces. All the sample prep
procedures, LC separation conditions, and MS parameters were held
constant during the experiments so that any change could be prescribed
solely to the differences in the interface. For the convenience of
the comparison, all the experimental data representing different colominic
acid degrees of polymerization under different source configurations
are presented in a grid format shown in Figure 2. The horizontal index represents the observed degree of colominic
acid polymerization (DP), and the vertical index represents the observed
number of lactones for each DP. The lactonization of polysialic acid
occurs through the internal esterification of the carboxyl groups
of adjacent hydroxyl groups and is well-known to stabilize the labile
bonds.26,27 Each individual square in the grid correlates
to a given DP with a given degree of lactonization. Under acidic conditions,
colominic acid will lactonize in solution and form a cluster of polymers
at each given DP with different degrees of lactonization.26,28 To illustrate this, the inset in Figure 2 shows the mass spectrum of the DP 3 polymer cluster acquired using
the conventional heated capillary ESI source. Different degrees of
DP 3 polymer lactonization are evident by the different peaks with
a mass difference of 18 Da indicating consecutive water losses from
each additional DP 3 lactonization. Of particular interest is the
overall coverage of the colominic acid polymers under different ion
source configurations. To make a comprehensive comparison between
the conventional ESI-MS and the SPIN-MS interfaces, the inlet heated
capillary temperature of the conventional interface was tuned separately
at 300 °C for optimal sensitivity and at 150 °C for gentler
ionization conditions using the tuning solution. The highest observed
DP, as shown by the blue squares in Figure 2, was 30 monomer units at the heated capillary temperature of 300
°C. This detection limit was further increased to 38 monomer
units (the green squares in Figure 2) at the
heated capillary temperature of 150 °C while the sensitivity
of the instrument decreased significantly. Repeating the same experiment
with the SPIN source, the maximum detected DP further increased to
47, as shown by the red squares in Figure 2, with still better sensitivity than ESI source at 300 °C heated
capillary temperature. Every DP identified with the ESI-MS interface
was also identified with the SPIN-MS, and DPs between 8 and 20 were
observed in the 300 °C configuration to have a higher number
of lactones than 150 °C and the SPIN configurations. Many additional
structures of colominic acid polymers were positively identified by
SPIN-MS which were completely absent in data acquired with the conventional
ESI-MS at both heated capillary temperatures.

Figure 2 (a) Colominic acid coverage
by ESI at 300 °C (blue), 150 °C
(green), and SPIN (red) with each square relating to a given DP (horizontal
index) with a fixed number of lactones (vertical index). Vertical
divisions within a given square demonstrate that a given polymer was
observed under all three conditions, and horizontal divisions indicate
observation at two conditions.

In addition to tuning the temperature of the heated capillary
inlet,
the attempt was made to tune the conventional ESI-MS interface to
even gentler conditions by adjusting the declustering dc field between
the tube lens and the skimmer. When the instrument was tuned for optimal
sensitivity, as was the case in the 300 °C temperature condition,
the voltage on the tube lens was set to 190 V and the skimmer at 46
V with the pressure in the skimmer interface region being roughly
1.30 Torr. The tube lens voltage was subsequently decreased to 55
V to minimize in-source fragmentation at both heated capillary temperatures
of 150 and 300 °C, respectively. The experimental evaluation
indicated that reducing the declustering field showed essentially
no gain in polymer coverage and resulted in further losses of instrument
sensitivity, confirming that the heated capillary temperature effectively
defined the gentleness of the interface under such conditions.

To further explore the mechanism behind the different polymer coverage
under the different ion source configurations, Figure SI1 in the Supporting Information shows the DP versus elution
time for all the polymers detected via LC–MS analyses of colominic
acid at 300 °C ESI and 150 °C ESI interfaces and SPIN-MS
interface, respectively. For all three configurations the detected
DP number initially increased as the elution time increased. However,
for the 300 °C ESI interface (Supporting
Information Figure SI1a), a noticeable DP detection threshold
appears at ∼60 min into the LC gradient with a maximum DP of
30. After this time point, only a mixture of DPs smaller than 30 was
detected. Since the larger the DP number corresponds to more fragile
polymers, the later eluting longer length DPs beyond ∼60 min
were most likely broken into shorter DP polymers by the in-source
fragmentation of glycosidic bonds for the 300 °C heated capillary
inlet temperature.27 This effect was partially
mitigated by lowering the heated capillary temperature to 150 °C
(Supporting Information Figure SI1b). The
maximum DP threshold in 150 °C ESI interface was observed later
in the LC gradient at ∼70 min and increased to DP 38, beyond
which the later eluting larger DP polymers were again “disassociated”
by in-source fragmentation. In contrast, the maximum detected DP in
the SPIN source configuration (Supporting Information Figure SI1c) extended across most of the LC separation. A less pronounced
DP threshold (DP 47) only appeared at close to the end of the LC separation.
Shorter length DPs were still observed later in the LC gradient for
the SPIN source, indicating DP number larger than 47 may still experience
in-source fragmentation even at the SPIN operating conditions. However,
data acquired with the SPIN-MS interface exhibited better polymer
coverage as compared to using the conventional ESI-MS interface at
both heated capillary temperatures (i.e., the most gentle ion source
among three tested in this study).

Although the same LC separation
conditions were used for all the
LC–MS analyses of colominic acid at the three tested ion source
configurations, the observed mass spectra from each configuration
differed significantly. As an example, Figure 3 shows the averaged mass spectra for the LC elution time window between
70 and 80 min for 300 °C ESI source (Figure 3a), 150 °C ESI source(Figure 3b), and SPIN source (Figure 3c) configurations,
respectively. This LC elution time window was chosen based in Figure 2 with the expectation that higher DP polymers should
be detected by MS at later elution times. The predominant ions detected
using the 300 °C ESI source, as shown in Figure 3a, were singly charged short polymers DP 2, DP 3, DP 4, and
DP 5. Polymer clusters were shifted by mass differences of 273.09
or 291.10 Da indicating a sialic acid monomer monosaccharide difference.26 Multiply charged large polymers, such as 3+
DP 19, 2+ DP 13, and 4+ DP 26 (Figure 3a inset),
were detected at more than an order of magnitude lower intensity.
In fact, the singly charged short polymers DP 2 to DP 5 were observed
to be the dominant MS peaks throughout the entire LC–MS analysis
under the 300 °C ESI source configuration indicating extensive
in-source fragmentation in the interface. The ionization conditions
were shown to be significantly gentler using the 150 °C capillary
inlet. While the singly charged shorter polymers DP 2 to DP 5 were
still the most abundant peaks in Figure 3b
under the 150 °C inlet configuration, many multiply charged large
polymers, such as 4+ DP 25, 4+ DP 26, 5+ DP 32 were detected (Figure 3b inset) as compared to the 300 °C inlet configuration.
However, the intensity of the most abundant peaks for 150 °C
interface decreased roughly by a factor of 10 as compared to the 300
°C interface, implying a practical sensitivity limit preventing
further reducing the heated capillary temperature for even gentler
ionization condition. The most striking differences in the mass spectrum
were observed with the SPIN configuration. In concert with previous
results obtained with the SPIN source,18 we observed a notable shift in the charge state distribution toward
higher charge states. A representative example of this phenomenon
is illustrated by the mass spectrum in Figure 3c. Compared to the data obtained at the same LC elution window with
the ESI interface, the observed MS peak envelope for individual DPs
is pushed to higher charge states and the most abundant peak became
5+ DP 25. A more comprehensive plot of the polymer distribution versus
the observed charge state for different interface configurations is
shown in Figure SI2 of the Supporting Information. The predominant singly charged short polymer peaks observed in
high abundance under both 300 °C interface and 150 °C interface
configurations were completely absent for the SPIN source. The inset
in Figure 3c also shows that the significantly
larger 6+ DP 37 and 6+ DP 38 ions were observed in the SPIN source
configuration which were not detected in ESI source configurations
during the selected LC elution time window. For the 5+ DP 32 polymer,
observed only in 150 °C ESI and SPIN sources, the detected ion
intensity for SPIN is over an order of magnitude higher than what
was detected in the 150 °C ESI configuration. A similar increase
in sensitivity was observed for all DPs commonly detected in the same
charge state with both ion sources.

times 70–80
min from the LC–MS analysis of colominic acid for the conventional
ESI interface operated with capillary inlet temperatures of 300 °C
(a), and 150 °C (b), and for the SPIN interface (c). The numbers
in blue indicate a sialic acid monomer mass difference between polymer
units.

Figure 4 summarizes all DPs identified using
the GlyQ-IQ software tool for ESI 300 °C (Figure 4a), ESI 150 °C (Figure 4b), and
SPIN (Figure 4c) configurations, respectively,
within the same selected LC elution time window as shown in Figure 3 (i.e., from 70 to 80 min). Ion intensities in each
figure were normalized to the most abundant peak detected in the respective
ion source configuration. The most abundant ions were DP 2 and DP
5 for the 300 °C ESI source and 150 °C ESI source. Larger
DP polymers (10 < DP < 40) were identified in both ESI source
configurations with mostly less than 10% and 25% of the base peak
intensity for ESI 300 °C and ESI 150 °C source configurations,
respectively. Conversely, as shown in Figure 4c, the most abundant peak in SPIN interface configuration shifted
to DP 25 and larger DPs were observed in much higher relative abundances.

Figure 4 Polymer
structures were extracted from the mass spectra shown in
Figure 3 via the GlyQ-IQ software, and a plot
of degree of polymerization vs relative intensity (normalized to the
most abundant peak) is shown for ESI 300 °C (a), ESI 150 °C
(b), and the SPIN interface (c).

For each observed colominic acid polymer, the mass spectrum
contained
a distribution of peaks corresponding to different degrees of lactonization.
Lactone profiles for various DPs observed in multiple charge states
from the SPIN source configuration are further shown in Figure 5a. In these plots, the intensity of each observed
lactone was normalized to the most abundant lactone and plotted as
a function of percent lactonization (number of lactones divided by
the DP). For all polymers shown in the plot, the most abundant peak
was always observed at ∼50% lactonization, independent of charge
state and length of the polymer. This phenomenon was observed across
all DPs detected, and Figure 5b shows a plot
of the degree of polymerization against the degree of lactonization
for all DPs observed with the SPIN source. For each polymer identified,
only the most abundant peak from the lactone profile was included
in the plot. The slope of the best fit line is roughly 0.50, which
indicates that the most abundant peak for each observed DP correlated
to roughly 50% lactonization. Similar trends were observed from the
analyses conducted in both conventional ESI configurations indicating
that the degree of lactonization was also independent of the interface
configuration. Additional experiments are being conducted to probe
whether the observed lactone profile has biological significance or
is merely the consequence of sample preparation or LC conditions.

the polymers DP 17 (blue triangles), DP 23 (red circles), DP 27 (green

of the peaks is indicated in parentheses. (b) Plot of the degree of
lactonization vs the degree of polymerization for the most abundant

In addition to the studies conducted with colominic
acid, the structural
features observed from the LC–MS analysis of N-glycans containing
sialic acid were further compared between the ESI-MS and the SPIN-MS
interfaces. These glycans are relevant because of the labile nature
of the sialic acid residue making the MS detection of the intact glycans
very challenging.29,30 Similar to the colominic acid
experiment, the LC–MS analyses of these sialic acid containing
glycans were performed with the ESI-MS interface operated at both
high heated capillary temperature (300 °C) for optimal sensitivity
and low temperature (150 °C) for reduced in-source fragmentation
and with the SPIN-MS interface. Figure 6 shows
the mass spectra of a representative sialic acid containing N-glycan,
Hex5HexNAc4NeuAc2 (2224.01 Da), extracted from the LC–MS analysis of
human serum with different source configurations. The intact glycan
in Figure 6 was first positively identified
by using the GlyQ-IQ informatics software. The corresponding fragments
in the spectra were then manually identified from the structure of
the glycan. The spectra shown in the figure were obtained by averaging
60 scans across the chromatographic peak eluted at the same time in
all instrument configurations. With the ESI-MS interface at the capillary
temperature of 300 °C, the intact glycan, highlighted in red
in Figure 6, was observed only at the 2+ charge
state (1113.39 m/z) and in low abundance
with an observed ratio of the extracted ion current (EIC) to total
ion current (TIC) of 6.2%, as shown in Figure 6a. The predominant peaks in the spectrum were from glycan fragment
ions, and their respective putative structures are annotated in the
figure. Concurrent with the colominic acid analysis, the sialic acid
residue fragment ions were present in the spectrum at 292.10 m/z indicating the loss of a sialic acid.
By lowering the capillary temperature to 150 °C, as shown in
Figure 6b, the intensity of the fragment ions
decreased significantly, whereas the abundance of the intact glycan
peak was greatly increased. In addition, the 3+ charge state of the
intact glycan ions at 742.60 m/z was clearly visible in the spectrum. By summing the EICs for both
charge states, the ratio of analyte EIC to the TIC increased to 29.8%.
The mass spectrum observed with the SPIN-MS interface is shown in
Figure 6c. The sialic acid containing fragment
ions present in the ESI spectra (at 819.29 m/z, 657.24 m/z, and 292.10 m/z) are noticeably absent from the spectrum
while the intensity of the intact glycan increased substantially.
The ratio of analyte EIC to TIC improved to 42.6%. When compared to
the signal obtained with the ESI-MS interface operated at 150 °C,
the intensity of the 2+ and 3+ intact glycan ions using SPIN-MS interface
increased by factors of roughly 4.4 and 46.5, respectively. Similar
results were observed for other glycans identified in the human serum
samples with an additional example of the N-glycan, Hex6HexNAc5NeuAc3 (2881.03
Da), shown in the Supporting Information as Figure SI3. These results confirm again that the SPIN-MS interface
not only improves analyte sensitivity but also greatly reduces in-source
fragmentation preserving intact sialic acid containing glycans.

respectively, blue squares represent N-acetylhexosamine

used as a modification to represent a generic hexose.

The gentler ionization conditions and the shift
in charge state
envelope toward higher charge state observed in the SPIN-MS as compared
to the conventional heated capillary ESI-MS interfaces are most likely
due the differences in the droplet desolvation process between these
interfaces. Although the initial formation of charged droplets in
electrospray follows the same mechanism in both SPIN and conventional
ESI sources,31 the regions and rates in
which droplet desolvation occurs differ significantly. In the heated
capillary ESI-MS interface, desolvation occurs dominantly in the higher
pressure region inside the heated capillary as the charged droplets
are transmitted from ambient pressures to the first vacuum stage of
the instrument. The extended period of charged droplet desolvation
in a narrow bore heated inlet capillary in the conventional ESI-MS
interface design results in significant gas-phase ion/molecule or
ion/ion reactions decreasing the analyte charge state,32,33 and the fully desolvated analyte ions may fragment following proton
transfer reactions from the carboxylic acid to the glycosidic bond.
In addition, transport through the heated capillary can result in
preferential loss of higher mobility species, i.e., higher charge
state ions, biasing data toward lower charge states.34 In contrast, droplet desolvation in the SPIN source occurs
inside the ion funnel in the cooler and subambient pressure region,
a much gentler environment reducing both charge state bias from our
previous studies and ion in-source fragmentation as evident in this
study using labile colominic acid polymers and N-glycans. These results
suggest that the greater speed of the transfer process plays a role
in the distinctive properties of SPIN observed in this work.

Conclusions
Through the LC–MS analyses of labile colominic acid polymers
and N-glycans obtained from human serum, we compared the ionization
conditions between using the conventional heated capillary ESI-MS
interface and the SPIN-MS interface. We demonstrated that for SPIN-MS
the coverage of colominic acid increased by ∼25% compared to
the conventional ESI-MS interface. Tuning the conventional ESI interface
to provide gentler conditions increased polymer coverage but at the
cost of significant loss of sensitivity. In the SPIN-MS interface,
both gentle ionization conditions and high sensitivity can be achieved
simultaneously. For polymers observed in both interface configurations,
the SPIN source demonstrated on average more than an order of magnitude
enhancement in sensitivity. The extended colominic acid DP coverage
and increase in observed charge states in SPIN are indicative of gentler
ionization conditions, with each polymer observed in the mass spectrum
having a lactone profile with the most abundant peak correlating to
roughly 50% lactonization. The SPIN source also demonstrated a shift
toward higher charge states allowing for extended coverage by reducing
the m/z of the detected polymers.
Because the colominic acid polymer is composed of sialic acid residues
containing similar glycosidic linkages and structural features to
sialic acid containing N-glycans, it can be used to tune ion source
conditions to reduce in-source fragmentation for more effective analysis.
Analysis of N-glycans containing sialic acid with the SPIN-MS interface
showed a notable decrease in in-source fragmentation and greater than
an order of magnitude enhancement in sensitivity as compared to using
the conventional heated capillary ESI-MS interface. These studies
indicate that analyses of labile compounds, including colominic acid
and glycan, are greatly facilitated by SPIN-MS.
