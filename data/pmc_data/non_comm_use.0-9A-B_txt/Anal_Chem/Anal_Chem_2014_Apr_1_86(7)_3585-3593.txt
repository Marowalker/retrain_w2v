Quantitative metabolomics and proteomics
technologies are powerful
approaches to explore cellular metabolic regulation. Unfortunately,
combining the two technologies typically requires different LC-MS
setups for sensitive measurement of metabolites and peptides. One
approach to enhance the analysis of certain classes of metabolites
is by derivatization with various types of tags to increase ionization
and chromatographic efficiency. We demonstrate here that derivatization
of amine metabolites with tandem mass tags (TMT), typically used in
multiplexed peptide quantitation, facilitates amino acid analysis
by standard nanoflow reversed-phase LC-MS setups used for proteomics.
We demonstrate that this approach offers the potential to perform
experiments at the MS1-level using duplex tags or at the MS2-level
using novel 10-plex reporter ion-containing isobaric tags for multiplexed
amine metabolite analysis. We also demonstrate absolute quantitative
measurements of amino acids conducted in parallel with multiplexed
quantitative proteomics, using similar LC-MS setups to explore cellular
amino acid regulation. We further show that the approach can also
be used to determine intracellular metabolic labeling of amino acids
from glucose carbons.

Cellular
metabolic regulation
is a key aspect in the biology of cancer, diabetes, and many other
diseases. As a result of the high complexity of cell metabolism, systems-level
analyses are crucial in understanding its regulation, involving both
quantitative proteomic and metabolic measurements.1 Amino acids are a particularly important class of metabolites
since they are key intermediates between carbon and nitrogen metabolism
supporting protein synthesis and many other anabolic processes in
cells. Dysregulated amino acid metabolism is associated with a number
of infantile genetic diseases such as phenylketonuria2 and maple syrup urine disease3 and has recently been shown to be involved in certain cancers.4 Unfortunately, mass spectrometry analysis of
amino acids is not directly amenable to the reversed-phase LC-MS setups
commonly used for proteomics,5 making parallel
proteomic and metabolomic measurements difficult. Even with many other
types of LC-MS analyses, such as with hydrophilic interaction chromatography
(HILIC) and ion-pairing reversed-phase chromatography, amino acids
remain difficult to analyze because of their high polarity, poor ionization
efficiency, and high structural similarity.5

Chemical derivatization is a powerful approach to analyze
classes
of molecules by mass spectrometry providing increased sensitivity
and chromatographic separation during LC-MS.5 Although derivatization approaches are limited to metabolites carrying
specific functional groups, isotope enrichment of the chemical tag
can be used to derivatize standards, eliminating the need for an isotopically
enriched standard for each compound. Chemical labeling also typically
increases the ionization efficiency and chromatographic resolution
of the compound and increases the mass to a higher, cleaner m/z range.

A common derivatization
strategy for amine metabolites, including
amino acids is the use of NHS ester-based reaction chemistry followed
by LC-MS analysis. This strategy has previously been employed to measure
amine metabolites using tags designed for peptide quantification;
iTRAQ,6 AcQ,7 and DiART.8,9 The NHS ester-based, amine-derivatizing,
tandem mass tag (TMT) reagents are also available for peptide analysis
for multiplexed quantitative proteomics, whereby their addition to
a peptide maintains a nominal mass for tagged peptides from multiple
samples but fragmentation produces unique isotopic reporter ions for
multiplexed sample quantitation.10 These
reagents are set apart from previous isobaric tags by recent improvements
allowing up to 10 unique reporter ions distinguishable by high-resolution
mass spectrometry.15 Here, we have employed
TMT reagents to facilitate reversed-phase LC-MS analysis of amino
acids. We demonstrate the utility of the approach for MS1- and MS2-based
quantitation, whereby MS2-based quantitation facilitates multiplexed
analysis such that amino acids can be measured in parallel with novel
10-plex TMT-based quantitative proteomics. We further demonstrate
a combination of metabolic and TMT labeling to measure glucose flux
to amino acids in breast cancer cells with amplified serine biosynthesis.

Experimental
Section
Cell Culture
MCF-7, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, and SKBR3
cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing
10% FBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). MCF10A cells were maintained in
DMEM/F12 containing 5% horse serum, 2 ng/mL epithelial growth factor
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), 500 ng/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO), 100 ng/mL cholera toxin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and
10 μg/mL insulin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Cells were subcultured
by rinsing with PBS and detaching with 0.5% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). For experiments measuring amino acids during glucose
withdrawal or cell line comparison experiments, cells were plated
in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells per
well. For glucose withdrawal experiments, cells were plated in high-glucose
(25 mM) DMEM, allowed to adhere overnight, and then switched to media
containing either 10 or 1 mM glucose for 24 h. For multiplexed proteomics
comparison of 5 cancer cell lines, all cell lines were plated in 15
cm plates at 5 × 106 cells per plate and grown to
80% confluency. For 13C-glucose labeling experiments, cells
were plated in high glucose DMEM overnight and then switched to fully
labeled 13C-glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Tewksbury,
MA) for 48 h.

Metabolite Extraction, Labeling, and Glucose/Lactate
Analysis
For media analysis, media was removed from cells,
diluted 4×
with cold methanol, and centrifuged at 13 000g for 5 min, and the supernatant extract was used for labeling. For
intracellular analysis, cells were rinsed with PBS and extracted by
scraping in 300 μL of cold (−80 °C) 80% methanol
and then centrifuged at 13 000g for 5 min.
All TMT labeling (standards, media extract, or intracellular extract)
was achieved by mixing 30 μL of standard or extract with 70
μL of 50 mM TEAB and 10 μL of 2 μg/mL TMT0, TMT6,
or TMT10 reagent in anhydrous acetonitrile. The reaction proceeded
for 1 h then was quenched with hydroxyamine to a final concentration
of 0.5%. For media amino acid analysis, 4 μL of a stock of 20
amino acids (10 pmol/μL) labeled with TMT0 was mixed with media
samples labeled with TMT6 (126 reagent). For 10-plex intracellular
metabolite analysis, the 10 cell line samples were labeled and mixed
equally and 4 μL of the TMT0 stock was then mixed with the sample.
For all experiments, mixed samples were diluted 1:100 in 0.1% formic
acid for LC-MS. Glucose and lactate in the media were determined using
the Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI) 7100 (Yellow Springs, OH).

Protein
Extraction, Digest, Labeling, and Fractionation
Cell culture
plates (15 cm) were rinsed with PBS, and cells were
scraped in 2 mL of 2% SDS and 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.5), containing one
tablet of complete mini protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Madison,
WI) per 10 mL of lysis buffer. Lysates were homogenized with an Omni
homogenizer (Kennesaw, GA) at the highest speed setting for 12 s per
sample. Cysteine residues were reduced with 5 mM DTT and alkylated
with 14 mM iodoacetamide followed by methanol–chloroform precipitation.
Precipitated protein was resolubilized in 6 M guanidine–HCl
and 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.5), and protein content was measured using a
BCA assay (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). An aliquot of 50 μg
of protein from each sample was diluted to 2 M guanidine–HCl
with 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.5) and digested for 2 h with endoproteinase
Lys-C (Wako, Japan) at a ratio of 1:200 Lys-C/protein. Samples were
further digested overnight with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at
a ratio of 1:100 trypsin/protein. The digest was acidified with formic
acid to a pH < 3, and peptides were desalted using 50 mg of solid-phase
C18 extraction cartridges (Waters, Millford, MA), followed by lyophilization.
Samples were resuspended in 100 μL of 200 mM HEPES (pH 8.5)
and 30% ACN. To each sample, 10 μL of 20 μg/mL 10-plex
TMT reagents in anhydrous acetonitrile was added. The reaction proceeded
for 1 h and then was quenched with hydroxylamine to a final concentration
of 0.5%. Samples were then combined equally, desalted using 50 mg
of solid-phase C18 extraction cartridge (Waters, Millford, MA), and
then lyophilized. Basic-pH reversed-phase chromatography was used
to fractionate the labeled peptide sample using an Agilent 300-Extend,
4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 μm C18 column (Agilent, Santa Clara,
CA). A gradient of 5% to 40% acetonitrile (10 mM ammonium formate,
pH 8) was applied at a flow rate of 800 μL/min using an Agilent
1100 pump. Fractions were collected every 0.38 min, beginning at 10
min; then, every 12th fraction was combined to a single sample creating
12 fractions. Eight representative fractions were desalted using homemade
stage-tips as previously described11 and
lyophilized.

LC-MS and Data Analysis of Labeled Amino
Acids
For
MS1-level analyses, all labeled amines were analyzed using an Orbitrap
Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA)
coupled with a Thermo-Pal autosampler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San
Jose, CA) and an Accela 600 LC pump (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San
Jose, CA). Chromatography was performed using a 100 μm ×
12 cm column, self-packed with 0.5 cm of Magic C4 resin (5 μm
particle size, Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA) and 12 cm of Maccel
C18 AQ resin (3 μm particle size, Nest Group, Southborough,
MA). An injection volume of 4 μL was used, and a gradient of
2% to 70% ACN (0.1% formic acid) over 15 min was used to separate
compounds at a flow rate of 200 nL/min. The mass spectrometer scan
range was 295–450 m/z for
amino acids, but for determining broader classes of labeled amines,
the scan range was set to 295–1200 m/z. All MS-1 analyses were conducted in positive ion mode
using an AGC setting of 3 × 106, a resolution setting
of 5 × 105, and a maximum injection time of 50 ms.
Internal calibration was achieved using lock mass values of 371.10124
and 445.12003 as previously described.12 LC-MS data were converted to mzXML format using a modified version
of ReadW.exe and analyzed using the metabolomics software, Maven.13 Peaks for TMT-labeled amines were identified
using extracted ion chromatograms based on predicted masses for TMT-labeled
amines from a published list14 with a tolerance
of 5 ppm.

LC-MS2 and Data Analysis of Labeled Amino Acids
For
MS2-level multiplexed analyses of amino acids, we used a Q-Exactive
mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) coupled
to a Famos autosampler and an Accella 600 LC pump (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
San Jose, CA). Chromatography was performed using a 100 μm ×
12 cm column self-packed with 0.5 cm of Magic C4 resin (5 μm
particle size, Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA) and 12 cm of Maccel
C18 AQ resin (3 μm particle size, Nest Group, Southborough,
MA). An injection volume of 4 μL was used, and a gradient of
2% to 70% ACN (0.1% formic acid) over 30 min was used to separate
compounds at a flow rate of 200 nL/min. MS1 was performed using a
scan range of 295–450 m/z, collision energy of 35, maximum injection time of 10 ms, and resolution
of 6 × 104. Amino acids were selected for fragmentation
to detect their reporter ions using an inclusion list of expected
TMT-labeled m/z for the 20 proteinogenic
amino acids. MS2 were collected using HCD with a minimum threshold
of 500 counts and a resolution setting of 3 × 104.
Raw files were converted to mzXML format using a modified version
of ReadW.exe. Peak areas of the MS1 for TMT0 and TMT10 were analyzed
using Maven13 and used to calculate the
total amount of each amino acid from all 10 cell line samples (based
on the TMT0 20 amino acid stock). MS2 scans for each amino acid were
extracted with an in-house tool and using the TMT0-labeled version
to determine proper retention time for TMT10 MS2 scans. For each amino
acid, the sum of the reporter ion S/N values was converted to a percentage
of the total for all 10 samples. These percentages were then used
to calculate amino acid amounts based on the total (TMT0-calibrated)
amount.

LC-MS3 and Data Analysis of 10-Plex Quantitative Proteomics
Each basic-pH reversed-phase fraction was resuspended in 0.1% formic
acid and analyzed on an Orbitrap Elite (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
San Jose, CA) using an Orbitrap LC-MS3 method as described previously.15 Briefly, the top 10 precursor ions in each MS1
scan were selected for fragmentation and generation of an MS2 scan
(used for peptide identification), from which multiple MS2 precursors
were selected for an MS3 scan (used for reporter ion quantification).
Spectra were matched against a Uniprot database (downloaded August,
2011) of human proteins, and protein false discovery rate was controlled
to less than 1% using the reverse-database strategy.16 Reporter ion S/N for all peptides matching each protein
were summed, and protein relative expression values were represented
as a fraction of the total intensity for all TMT reporter ions for
the protein. Proteins that were uniquely expressed at either high
or low levels for each cell line were determined using a Euclidian
distance metric to rank protein similarity to a given expression pattern
(e.g., highly expressed only in both replicates of MCF10A cells).
The top 50-ranked proteins for each pattern (high or low) were submitted
to DAVID bioinformatics tool (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov) to perform functional clustering and assign over-represented GO
terms to each group of proteins. GO terms meeting Bonferroni-corrected p-values <0.05 were considered as over-represented.

Results and Discussion
Here, we have employed amine-reactive
TMT reagents to derivatize
amino acids and enhance their analysis by LC-MS. The TMT0 reagent
is not enriched in stable isotopes and thus differs in mass from the
traditional TMT reagents by 5 Da facilitating MS1-based quantitation
when compared to TMT6 or TMT10 reagents (Figure 1A). To determine whether TMT-labeling of amino acids could facilitate
their analysis by reversed-phase LC-MS analysis, we labeled 20 amino
acid standards with TMT0 and analyzed the mixture (100 fmol of each
amino acid) by LC-MS. As a comparison, an equivalent amount of 20
unlabeled amino acid standards was also analyzed. While the unlabeled
forms of amino acids gave poor signal and peak shape, all 20 TMT-labeled
forms of amino acids were detected, most with drastically improved
peak shape and decreased peak width (Figure 1B). Although difficult to assess improvements in sensitivity imparted
by TMT labeling since many unlabeled amino acids are not detected,
increases in sensitivities observed here are similar to those reported
using DiART tags (>20-fold on average).8 These improvements are likely a result of improved ionization efficiency
and hydrophobicity imparted by the TMT reagent and an m/z shift to a cleaner mass range than is typical
of the unlabeled amino acids. There are multiple quantitative amino
acid analysis strategies whereby TMT-labeling could be employed using
MS1- or MS2-based LC-MS (Figure 1C). In these
strategies, TMT0 can be combined with TMT6 or TMT10, significantly
extending the capabilities provided by other amine labeling approaches,
allowing absolute quantitation and multiplexing with 10 samples. We
also noticed that TMT-labeling of amino acids provided baseline chromatographic
separation of peaks for the isobaric amino acids leucine and isoleucine.
To distinguish leucine peaks from isoleucine, we analyzed standards
of each amino acid alone, or as a mixture, and observed consistent
elution of isoleucine (retention time = 8.15 to 8.21 min) prior to
leucine (retention time = 8.36 to 8.44 min) (Figure 2). As such, TMT-labeling and reversed-phase LC-MS can be used
to detect all 20 proteinogenic amino acids.

Figure 1 TMT labeling facilitates
sensitive and versatile amino acid measurements
by reversed-phase LC-MS. (A) Labeling scheme. TMT reagents, available
as nonenriched (TMT0) or isotope-enriched (TMT6 or TMT10), react with
free amines in amino acid standard preparations or methanol extracts
of media or tissues. (B) Enhanced sensitivity of TMT-labeled amino
acids for reversed-phase LC-MS. Standards of the 20 proteinogenic
amino acids (10 pmol/μL) were either labeled with TMT0 or left
unlabeled. Samples were diluted in 0.1% formic acid, and 100 fmol
was analyzed by reversed-phase LC-MS. Shown are the extracted ion
chromatograms of the TMT0-labeled and unlabeled amino acid forms.
(C) Potential MS approaches to measure TMT-labeled amino acids and
other amines. Two samples can be compared using MS1-based comparison
of TMT0 and TMT6. Six to ten samples can be compared by using isobaric
tags (TMT6126–131 or TMT10126–131) with MS2-based reporter ions. For both of these approaches, TMT0-labeled
internal standards can be used for absolute quantitation. Serine is
used here to exemplify the approaches.

Figure 2 Separation of leucine and isoleucine by reversed-phase chromatography
after TMT-labeling. Standards of leucine and isoleucine (1 pmol) were
labeled individually with TMT0 and (in duplicate) 10 fmol of each
was analyzed by LC-MS either individually or together.

Large-scale consumption and release measurements
have recently
been employed to show that glycine utilization correlates with cell
proliferation.17 On the basis of these
findings, we propose that our method using TMT could be valuable in
determining amino acid consumption from cell culture media. We thus
employed an MS1-based duplex labeling strategy whereby a set of 20
amino acid standards was labeled with TMT0 to generate a 10 pmol/μL
stock which could be used to internally calibrate and calculate TMT6-labeled
media amino acid amounts. Samples were analyzed by nanoflow reversed-phase
LC-MS using a standalone Orbitrap, and amino acid amounts based on
LC-MS peak areas were then determined. Spent media amounts were subtracted
from control media amounts (with no cells) to determine consumption
or release (Figure 3A). We demonstrated this
approach by determining amino acid consumption or release in highly
glycolytic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells during glucose-starvation
(Figure 3B,C). We observed significantly greater
consumption of most amino acids in glucose-starved versus unstarved
cells (Figure 3C). The most pronounced increase
in consumption (1.9-fold) was for glutamine, which was accompanied
by increased glutamate release (Figure 3C).
Glutamine is an important fuel source for anabolic pathways in cancer
cells,18 so it is not surprising that these
glucose-deprived cells increased glutamine consumption. Amino acid
consumption and release observed in this experiment are similar to
those in the recent large-scale consumption and release data set for
MDA-MB-231 cells, whereby the majorly consumed amino acid was glutamine,
with concomitant glutamate release.17

Figure 3 Amino
acid consumption or release in a breast cancer cell line
using MS1-based measurements of TMT-labeled amino acids. (A) Procedure
for measuring amino acid uptake. Media samples were extracted by diluting
4-fold in 80% methanol followed by centrifugation. Supernatant was
diluted 3-fold in 50 mM TEAB buffer (pH 8.5) and labeled with a single
TMT6 reagent (126 reporter ion version). Amino acid amounts were determined
by mixing with known quantities of TMT0-labeled amino acids followed
by LC-MS analysis. Amino acid amounts in spent media were subtracted
from control media (no cells) to determine consumption or release.
(B) MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded overnight in high glucose DMEM and
then switched to 10 or 1 mM glucose media. After 24 h, glucose and
lactate analysis of the media by YSI showed complete glucose depletion
and conversion to lactate in the 1 mM glucose-grown cells. (C) Media
was measured using TMT labeling and LC-MS as outlined in panel (A).
Amino acid consumption (+ values) or release (− values) from
MDA-MB-231 cells in normal (10 mM glucose) versus glucose-limited
(1 mM glucose) media is shown. *t test p < 0.05.

Toward determining intracellular
amino acid measurements, we first
explored the detection of intracellular amines by LC-MS after TMT
labeling. We labeled an 80% methanol extract of MCF-7 breast cancer
cells with TMT0 and matched LC-MS peaks against amine-containing metabolites
from a published list of 137 human central carbon metabolites14 (ppm tolerance = 5 ppm). The most abundantly
detected peaks were observed for amino acids, although several other
amine-containing species were matched to the list, including relatively
unstudied metabolites such as taurine and N-acetylputrescine
(Table S-1, Supporting Information).
Although other primary amine-containing metabolites exist in cells,
their detection was not the focus of these analyses. The metabolites
we detected here are similar, however, to studies whereby amines in
cell lines were tagged using either iTRAQ,6 Acq,7 or DiART.8 Taken together, these results indicate that, although many putative
amine metabolites are present, amino acids and several other related
amines dominate the amine metabolite profile of cultured cells. Analysis
of other sample types such as plasma and other bodily fluids may reveal
a greater number of amine metabolites. Indeed, analysis of amines
in saliva by others using dansylation derivatization of amines revealed
a large number of putative amine features but were mostly unidentified.19

We next utilized 10-plex isobaric labeling
reagents (Figure S-1, Supporting Information) to perform multiplexed
analysis of amino acids, comparing 5 different breast cancer cell
lines: MCF10A (basal-like, nontumorigenic), MCF-7 (luminal A, estrogen
receptor positive, progesterone receptor positive), MDA-MB-231 (basal,
triple negative), MDA-MB-468 (basal, triple negative, overexpressing
EGFR), and SKBR3 (overexpressing ERBB2). Cell line samples were prepared
in biological duplicates among the 10 TMT labels, injecting each sample
in triplicate (Figure 4A). For amino acid quantitation,
the total amount of each amino acid in all samples was estimated on
the basis of the internal-calibrant stock solution of TMT0-labeled
amino acid standards mixed with the samples (as shown in Figure 1C). During LC-MS2 data collection, amino acid m/z values were targeted using an inclusion
list to generate reporter ions. Reporter ion S/N values were summed
within each TMT10 channel (126–131, illustrated in Figure S-1, Supporting Information) and used to estimate
the fraction of the total amount of each amino acid in each cell line
sample. We observed glutamine and glutamate to be the most abundant
amino acids in most of the cell lines (Figure 4B), whereas aspartate was the most abundant in MCF-7 cells. Comparing
between cell lines, we observed the nontumorigenic cell line (MCF10A)
to have comparatively higher levels of glutamine and glutamate than
others and MDA-MB-468 and SKBR3 had comparatively higher levels of
serine (Figure 4B). We observed the amino acids
methionine, tryptophan, arginine, and asparagine to be among the least
abundant amino acids in the breast cancer cell lines used here. Unfortunately,
cysteine did not give sufficient MS1 signal to trigger MS2 acquisition.

TMT labeling allows multiplexed quantitation of proteins
and amino acids in parallel. (A) Setup of amino acid and proteomics
experiments. For amino acid analysis, 5 breast epithelial cell lines
were extracted in 80% methanol (in duplicate) and labeled using isobaric
10-plex TMT reagents (TMT10126–131) and then analyzed
by a targeted LC-MS2 method in triplicate. Absolute levels were determined
using TMT0-labeled amino acids as internal standards. For proteomics,
a data set was collected from the same 5 cell lines in duplicate,
using isobaric 10-plex TMT reagents (TMT10126–131) and analyzed by a 2D-LC-MS3 method. Reporter ion quantitation of
amino acids and protein expression is exemplified here by serine and
phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (a serine biosynthetic enzyme). (B)

the 10-plex proteomics data set reveals significant over-representation
of serine biosynthesis in MDA-MB-468 cells. (D) Comparative proteomic
and amino acid data across cell lines overlaid in the pathway format
for the glycine/serine biosynthetic pathway.

In parallel to the amino acid data, we also generated a 10-plex
quantitative proteomics data set for the same 5 breast cancer cell
lines in duplicate (Figure 4A). Here, we were
mainly interested in generating a data set with good coverage of the
major amino acid metabolism pathways, but many other proteins were
measured (Table S-2, Supporting Information). To interpret cell line differences, we extracted proteins that
were expressed at specifically high or low levels in a single cell
line (Table S-2, Supporting Information) and submitted them to DAVID bioinformatics resource19 for GO term enrichment analysis (Figure S-2B, Supporting Information). In terms of amino
acid metabolism, we observed significant amino acid GO term differences
in MDA-MB-468 cells, which were particularly unique in their elevated
expression of GO terms representing the serine and glycine biosynthesis
pathway: 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), phosphoserine aminotransferase
(PSAT), phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH), and cystathionine beta-synthase
(CBS) (Figure 4C and Figure S-2B, Supporting Information). Aligning quantitative
proteomic data for the serine/glycine biosynthetic pathway, we observe
slightly more serine and glycine in correlation with PHGDH, PSAT,
PSPH, and CBS (Figure 4D). It has recently
been shown that some breast and skin cancer cell lines, including
MDA-MB-468 cells, are dependent on amplification of the glycine/serine
biosynthetic pathway whereby glucose carbons are directed toward amino
acid synthesis.20,21Although serine biosynthesis was
the most profound change in these cells, other amino acid pathways
are shown with replicate analyses in Figure S-3, Supporting Information. We also find that MCF10A cells had
higher expression of GLUD1 (Table S-2, Supporting
Information) which is a key protein involved in glutamine utilization
and correlates with the higher levels of glutamine and glutamate observed
in these cells (Figure 4B) suggesting a reliance
on this pathway. We propose that, although collected with minimal
fractionation such that it is not completely comprehensive, the proteomic
data set (Table S-2, Supporting Information) could be used to inform upon proteins in breast cancer.

We
further incorporated amino acid and proteomic data to correlate
amino acid metabolism with molecular features important in oncogenesis.
Although we collected the proteomics data set to profile differences
in amino acid metabolism proteins, we were able to compare several
important cancer-related proteins from the data set (Table S-2, Supporting Information) and correlate them
with amino acid metabolism. We observed elevated glycine in MDA-MB-468
cells, which correlated with epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR)
(Figure 4B and Figure S-2A, Supporting Information). These results are interesting in
light of recent findings that glycine consumption is correlated with
cell proliferation in multiple cell lines and suggests that EGFR may
play a role in elevated serine/glycine biosynthesis.22 It is currently unclear how the serine biosynthesis pathway
is elevated in these cells but, it may be controlled by EGFR based
on our observations. We also observed a correlation between ERBB2,
in SKBR3 cells, with elevated GLDC (Figure 4B and Figure S-2A, Supporting Information), which is an important protein regulating glycine cleavage toward
one-carbon and folate metabolism in proliferating cells.4 The signaling kinase, AKT1, correlated with aspartate
levels in MCF-7 cells (Figure 4B and Figure
S-2A, Supporting Information) and may
play a role in regulation of aspartate levels. Although these correlates
remain to be validated, they provide directions for new hypotheses
in metabolic regulation.

We next determined whether TMT labeling
could be employed to detect
glucose flux to amine metabolites in cultured cells (as outlined in
Figure 5B,C). We chose to compare MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-468 cells since the quantitative proteomics data set revealed
that MDA-MB-468 cells have amplified levels of serine biosynthesis
proteins PHGDH, PSAT, and PSPH, whereas MCF-7 cells have very low
levels of these proteins but elevated levels of CBS (Figure 5A). These proteins are important in redirecting
glucose carbons from glycolysis into serine and glycine synthesis20 and possibly into cystathionine, a precursor
to cysteine-related redox metabolism (Figure 5C). MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells were grown in 10 mM fully 13C-labeled glucose for 48 h, and methanol extracts were labeled with
TMT0. Glucose uptake and lactate release for these 2 cell lines are
similar (Figure S-4, Supporting Information). For amino acids gaining 2 carbons from glucose (e.g glycine),
quantification of the metabolically labeled 213C peaks
may be interfered with from the naturally abundant 13C
peaks. We show, however, that this effect is minimal for TMT0-labeled
glycine (Figure S-5, Supporting Information). We observed significant levels of 313C-alanine in both
cell lines in which more than 90% of the alanine pool was 313C-labeled (Figure 5D). The presence of 313C-serine and 213C-glycine was correlated with
the expression of PHGDH, PSAT, and PSPH, where in MDA-MB-468 cells,
the 313C-serine and 213C-glycine pools were,
on average, 32% and 18%, respectively, but undetectable in MCF-7 cells
(Figure 5D). We also detect 313C-cystathionine
in both cell lines, where in MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells, it made up
35% and 4% of the total cystathionine pools, respectively (Figure 5D). It is unclear if carbon follows the same route
from glucose to cystathionine in both cell lines since we do not observe
glucose-labeled serine and glycine in MCF-7 cells. Although cystathionine
is a precursor to cysteine, we do not detect labeled cysteine in either
cell line. These data suggest glucose carbon might be directed toward
cystathionine biosynthesis to maintain redox metabolism. We did not
detect 13C incorporation to any other amino acids.

Figure 5 Analysis of
glycine/serine metabolism by TMT-labeling reveals glucose
incorporation to cystathionine and elevated glycine/serine metabolism
proteins. (A) Relative abundance, based on the 10-plex TMT quantitative
proteomics data set, for serine, glycine, and cystathionine metabolism
pathway proteins. Error bars are the standard error of the mean peptide
relative abundances for each protein (number of peptides is shown
in the inset). (B) Example MS1 spectra and corresponding XICs for,
TMT0-labeled, natural, and 13C-glucose-derived versions
of serine. (C) Major routes of labeled glucose carbon incorporation
into alanine, glycine, serine, and cystathionine. (D) 13C-glucose-carbon incorporation measured by TMT labeling of amines.
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells (with differing levels of glycine/serine
metabolism proteins) were grown for 48 h in fully 13C-labeled
glucose. Methanol extracts were labeled with TMT0 and analyzed by
LC-MS. Peaks were detected and measured for 13C-labeled
alanine, serine, glycine, and cystathionine revealing, for each of
these pools, the fraction originating from glucose.

Conclusion
Derivatization with TMT
reagents allows for enhanced amino acid
analyses using reversed-phase LC-MS. This approach facilitates parallel
quantitative analysis of both proteins and amino acids with similar
LC-MS setups. This approach is applicable to measuring flux of glucose
to amino acids, which is a very important phenomenon in many cancers.
By providing a highly multiplexed assay, TMT labeling of amino acids
could be easily incorporated into screening strategies to find therapeutic
targets for dysregulated amino acid metabolism in cancer. We also
propose that TMT labeling could be used for sensitive quantitation
of circulating amino acids as markers of genetic diseases like phenylketonuria
as well as detection of biogenic amines such as dopamine and serotonin.
The method can be scaled to use minimal sample amounts and reagent
quantities making the approach economical for most laboratories, providing
a new tool for exploring cellular metabolic regulation.
