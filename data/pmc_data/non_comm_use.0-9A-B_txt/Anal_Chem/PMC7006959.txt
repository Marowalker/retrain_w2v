We
report a method where the refractive index increments of an
iron storage protein, ferritin, and apoferritin (ferritin minus iron)
were measured over the wavelength range of 450–678 nm to determine
the average iron content of the protein. The protein used in this
study had ∼3375 iron atoms per molecule. The measurement of
optical dispersion over the broad wavelength range was enabled by
the use of mesoporous leaky waveguides (LWs) made of chitosan. We
present a facile approach for fabricating mesoporous chitosan waveguides
for improving the measurement sensitivity of macromolecules such as
ferritin. Mesoporous materials allow macromolecules to diffuse into
the waveguide, maximizing their interaction with the optical mode
and thus increasing sensitivity by a factor of ∼9 in comparison
to nonporous waveguides. The sensitivity was further improved and
selectivity toward ferritin was achieved by the incorporation of antibodies
in the waveguide. The method presented in this work is a significant
advance over the state of the art method, the enzyme linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) used in clinics, because it allows determining the average
content of ferritin in a single step. The average iron content of
ferritin is an important marker for conditions such as injury, inflammation,
and infection. Thus, the approach presented here of measuring optical
dispersion to determine the average iron content of ferritin has a
significant potential to improve the point of care analysis of the
protein for disease diagnosis and screening.

==== Body
Introduction
Ferritin serves as
the body’s primary iron-storage mechanism
and has been commonly used as a biomarker for the total body iron
content.1,2 The same protein without any stored iron
is called apoferritin. In some conditions such as injury, inflammation,
or infection, the ratio of ferritin to apoferritin, and hence the
average iron content per protein, may change.3 The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which is the state
of the art in clinics, measures combined ferritin and apoferritin
concentration because the iron content in the core of the protein
does not alter its ability to bind to the corresponding antibody.
Iron and protein may be assayed separately using methods such as UV
or atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and ELISA, respectively, but
the use of two completely different methods adds to the complexity
and analysis time of the combined measurement. UV absorption spectroscopy
has been shown to be a less reliable method of determining the iron
content of ferritin because of structural changes in the iron core
of the protein over time.4 Colorimetric
methods for determining iron generally require acidic digestion of
the sample followed by reduction to the ferrous state before addition
of colorimetric reagents such as o-phenanthroline.5 Methods such as Perls’ staining and biochemical
assays provide limited information on changes in body’s iron
content. Previously, the use of magnetic force microscopy has been
reported to distinguish ferritin from apoferritin,6,6 but
this method requires a modified atomic force microscope and the samples
must be purified and dried and thus cannot be considered a technique
suitable for rapid point of care diagnosis and screening.

Label-free
methods allow real-time monitoring, offer reduced complexity,
and are less tedious to use in comparison to ELISA because they do
not require multiple washing steps. Variants of label-free biosensors
are optical leaky waveguides (LWs), which are made of low-refractive-index
materials such as hydrogels.7,8 Light in the LWs is
confined by phenomena other than total internal reflection (TIR) at
either one or both of their interfaces. The simplest structure of
such a device is a slab waveguide made from a hydrogel layer sandwiched
between a higher refractive index substrate and a lower refractive
index cover layer. The confinement mechanism in this structure is
TIR at the waveguide–cover layer interface but Fresnel reflection
at the waveguide–substrate interface.9−12 Since the substrate–waveguide
interface is leaky, light can be coupled into and out of the waveguide
through the substrate using a prism. Other researchers have termed
these as hydrogel optical waveguides (HOWs)13−15 because of
the material used to fabricate the waveguide.

The resonance
angle is determined by the waveguide effective index,
which is a function of the real refractive indices of the waveguide
and cover (i.e., sample) layers. We have previously shown that the
LWs are capable of working over a wide range of wavelengths,10−12,16 limited only by material absorption
or scattering losses at short wavelengths and waveguide cutoff at
long wavelengths. Theoretical modeling of a LW consisting of an NBK7
substrate and a 1.5 μm hydrogel layer with a real refractive
index 0.01 higher than that of the water cover layer shows that the
device can operate from 320 nm (limited by absorption in the BK7 substrate)
and 950 nm (limited by cutoff). Thus, LWs allow determining the optical
dispersion of the sample species by measuring the resonance angle
as a function of wavelength over a broad range. HOWs typically use
a layer of gold between the substrate and hydrogel waveguide to permit
simultaneous surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and leaky waveguide operation.
This limits the operating wavelength range to above 600 nm because
the variation of the complex refractive index below this wavelength
prevents SPR operation and makes it difficult to visualize the waveguide
resonance angle. As discussed later, measurement of dispersion below
600 nm is needed to determine average iron content per protein. Similarly,
resonant waveguide gratings17 and grating-coupled
interferometers,18 although giving high
sensitivity to refractive index changes, are strongly dispersive because
of the use of grating couplers and high-index waveguides, thus making
it difficult to separate the dispersion of the sample from the sensor
dispersion.

The porosity of hydrogels is a significant factor
in determining
the sensitivity of these waveguides as biosensors and arises for two
reasons: (1) diffusion of a species into the hydrogel allow it to
interact with the fraction of the optical mode confined in the waveguide
in addition to the fraction in the evanescent field and (2) capture
antibodies for bioassays are immobilized in the entire volume of the
hydrogel waveguide, thereby increasing the number of available binding
sites for an analyte exposed to the waveguide and thus resulting in
an improved sensitivity. Previously, we demonstrated LWs made of agorose,
but spin-coated agarose waveguides were largely nonporous to macromolecules
and difficult to functionalize to immobilize antibodies.10,11 A naturally occurring polysaccharide, chitosan, with free amine
groups is attractive for the facile immobilization of antibodies.
High-refractive-index chitosan waveguides that rely on TIR for light
propagation have been reported for sensing relative humidity.19 Chitosan membranes prepared by casting and rehydration
after being dried have been reported to have a pore radius from 1
to 2 nm depending on the degree of cross-linking with glutaraldehyde.20 These pores are, however, much smaller than
the hydrodynamic radius of a majority of proteins,21,22 and thus such chitosan layers would not be suitable as waveguides
to support bioassays. Templating mediated by emulsions or incorporation
of nanoparticles followed by leaching has been used to make mesoporous
chitosan hydrogels with pore radii between 2 and 50 nm,23−25 which would be more suitable for protein penetration.

In the
work presented here, the feasibility of chitosan films to
serve as LWs was investigated for the first time. It was hypothesized
and demonstrated that mesoporous chitosan films are obtained by controlling
the drying time between spin coating of the film and subsequent rehydration.
This involved theoretical modeling along with experimental results
relating the effect of film porosity on the measurement sensitivity
of species of different molecular weights. We used the chitosan waveguides,
for the first time, to determine the optical dispersion of ferritin
over the visible wavelength range. More importantly, this is the first
report which shows that the optical dispersions of ferritin and apoferritin
over the visible wavelength range are significantly different. This
difference in the optical dispersions of ferritin and apoferritin
was subsequently used to estimate the average iron content of the
protein. The average number of iron atoms per molecule of the ferritin
used in this study was determined on the basis of the ratio of the
resonance angle shifts of ferritin and apoferritin at a selected wavelength.
Finally, the resonance angle shifts of ferritin and apoferritin measured
using the chitosan waveguide biosensor at two wavelengths was exploited
to develop an approach for determining the average iron content of
a ferritin sample in a mixture of the two proteins. In summary, we
set out to develop a biosensor with a significant potential to enable
point of care analysis of ferritin/apoferritin for disease diagnosis
and screening.

Experimental Section
Chemicals and Materials
Standard microscope glass slides
of 1 mm thickness were purchased from VWR (Leicestershire, U.K.).
Ethanol, 0.1 M acetic acid, poly(ethylene glycols) (PEGs) of different
molecular weights, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid
(HEPES), reactive blue 4 (RB4), N-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide sodium salt (sulfo-NHS), ferritin
(F4503), apoferritin (A3660), antiferritin (F6136), and bovine serum
albumin (BSA) were bought from Sigma-Aldrich (Gillingham, U.K.). Chitosan
(molecular weight 100–300 kDa and 90% deacytelated), glycerol
(molecular weight 92), and Decon 90 were purchased from Fisher (Loughborough,
U.K.).

Biosensor Fabrication
Glass slides were cut into squares
of ∼25.4 mm by 25.4 mm using a diamond scribe and cleaned in
Decon 90 solution, water, and ethanol for 30 min after each step in
an ultrasonic bath (Ultrawave U300H).

Chitosan was dissolved
in 0.1 M acetic acid, and the solution was then spin-coated on a glass
slide for 30 s. The concentration of chitosan solution was varied
from 0.5% (w/v) to 2% (w/v), and for each solution, the spin speed
was varied between 500 and 3000 rpm. The chitosan films were removed
from the chuck of the spin coater and allowed to dehydrate for variable
times. The films were then rehydrated and cross-linked by immersing
in 100 mM HEPES buffer and pH 8.5 buffer without and with 0.016% (v/v)
glutaraldehyde for 5 min, respectively. Subsequently, the films were
dipped in 0.1 mM RB4 solution in 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 for 5 min and
washed with the buffer. Finally, the cross-linked and dye-doped chitosan
films were stored in 100 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4 in the dark until
further use.

A 0.5 mg/mL antiferritin solution was prepared
in 100 mM HEPES
buffer, pH 5.6 containing 2 and 5 mM of EDC and sulfo-NHS, respectively.
The reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h, following which the pH
of the solution was increased to 7.4 by adding sodium hydroxide. The
activated antibody solution was pumped through a flow cell mounted
on the top of the chitosan waveguide and recirculated for 1.5 h to
allow antibody immobilization. A 1 mg/mL BSA solution was then used
to block free amine groups in the chitosan film. Finally, the response
to ferritin and apoferritin was recorded.

Instrumentation
The instrumentation used to test the
porosity of hydrogels and performance of waveguide biosensors has
been previously described in detail10−12 and is included inFigure S1 in the Supporting Information. A BK7
equilateral prism (Qioptic Photonics, Denbighshire, U.K.) was used
to couple light in and out of the hydrogel waveguide. The light source
and the detector were mounted on rails connected to goniometers to
allow radial and angular freedom, respectively.

The initial
traces of output versus angle of incidence were obtained using a TE-polarized
laser (Acculase, RS Components, Northamptonshire, U.K.) with a peak
wavelength of 650 nm and a power of 5 mW and a photodiode (OSD100-6,
Centronic, Surrey, U.K.).

To obtain spatially and angularly
resolved images, the laser was
replaced by a 650 nm superluminescent diode (SLD) (EXS210035-02, Exalos
AG, Schlieren, Switzerland). The output of the SLD was collimated
and subsequently expanded to 25 mm diameter and then passed through
a 40 mm focal length cylindrical lens to form a wedge beam to probe
the hydrogel waveguide with a range of angles of incidence simultaneously.
The SLD was used to reduce speckle in the output, which was imaged
using a 6.6 megapixel CMOS camera (PL-B781, Pixelink, Ottowa, Canada).
The camera allowed a 7.7 mm wide section of the leaky waveguide to
be imaged, which allowed the entire flow channel to be captured in
a single frame.

To obtain wavelength and angularly resolved
images, the SLD was
replaced by a white LED (W57L5111P, Roithner Lasertechnik). An assembly
of an achromatic doublet and polarizer was used to obtain a TE-polarized
collimated beam. The 40 mm focal length cylindrical lens was then
used to obtain a wedge beam. The output of the waveguide was passed
through a transmission grating (Thorlabs GT25-03, 300 lines mm–1, blaze angle 17.5°) to disperse the output light
and then an achromatic doublet to focus it onto the camera. A slit
was used before the grating to ensure that only light which passed
through the flowcell region of the device was dispersed and focused
onto the camera.

Fluids were pumped through the flow cell using
a peristaltic pump
(Minipuls 3, Gilson, Bedfordshire, U.K.) at a flow rate of 0.2 mL
min–1. The flowcell was CNC machined from 3 mm thick
black PMMA, forming a recessed cavity with a 4 mm wide and 0.2 mm
deep channel and surrounded by a groove 1 mm wide and 0.75 mm deep
in which was mounted an O-ring. The plate was placed on the waveguide
biosensor and held in place using a water-cooled fixture maintained
at 20 °C.

The refractive index of the solutions was measured
using an Abbe
refractometer with an accuracy of ±1 × 10–4. The UV–vis absorption spectroscopy was performed using a
Jenway 6715 UV–vis spectrometer.

Results and Discussion
Chitosan
Waveguides and Their Characterization
The
analytical equations governing the LWs have been previously provided.10 The initial waveguides were fabricated by spin
coating 2% (w/v) chitosan solution at 3000 rpm, which was allowed
to completely dry out before rehydration. A dip in the reflectivity
curve at the resonance angle was observed because of the incorporation
of absorption losses introduced by doping the waveguide by RB4. The
resonance angle of these waveguides was ∼4.5° higher than
the TIR angle, and the width of the resonance dip was ∼5°.
Refractive index sensitivity (RIS) of these waveguides was determined
by monitoring the shift in the resonance angle for different concentrations
of glycerol solutions. The RIS was ∼99.3° RIU–1 for glycerol solutions. A comparison of the response of the chitosan
waveguide to glycerol and PEG 10k solutions of similar refractive
index (see Figure 1) highlights that the two were significantly different (65.9 ±
5.4 versus 10.8 ± 1.1 millidegrees, respectively). Additionally,
the shift in the resonance angle for solutions of PEGs of molecular
weight from 10k to 400k was between 7% and 18% of that for the glycerol
solution of similar refractive index. This in turn suggested that
PEGs with a molecular weight of 10k and higher were unable to diffuse
in the waveguide, limiting their interaction to only the evanescent
field and hence RIS. This also implies that the waveguide will be
nonporous and hence have reduced RIS to biomolecules with molecular
weight and geometrical dimensions comparable to those of PEGs. Thus,
it was essential to increase the size of the pores in the chitosan
waveguides to tens of nanometers: i.e., the typical size of the proteins.21,22

Figure 1 Response
of fully dried chitosan waveguide to glycerol and PEG
solutions (where different traces represent different positions across
the width of the channel).

The concentration of chitosan solution used to make waveguides
was reduced to try to obtain waveguides that are porous to macromolecules.
A 1% (w/v) chitosan solution spun at 900 rpm was found to be the lowest
concentration of the polysaccharide that resulted in uniform thin
films capable of supporting an optical mode. The resulting fully dried
films were, however, nonporous. We observed that the films deposited
on glass substrates via spin coating were wet on removal from the
chuck and their thickness reduced and hence the pores collapsed as
they dehydrated. It is likely that the intermolecular forces between
the aligned polymer strands after spin coating did not allow these
films to swell to their original thickness and regain their pore structure
on rehydration. We hypothesized that, by controlling the drying time
before rehydration, we could prevent the original pore structure from
collapsing and obtain mesoporous chitosan waveguides.

Figure S2a provides the reflectivity
curves of the chitosan waveguides of varying drying time before rehydration. Figure S2a clearly illustrates that the resonance
angle of the waveguides dehydrated for 1 and 2 min was close to the
TIR angle (∼61.55°) because of their low optical thickness
(product of refractive index and geometrical thickness). The film
dried for 3 min resulted in a reflectivity dip at the resonance angle
with low fwhm, while the film dried for 10 min had the highest resonance
angle and fwhm. A surface profiler and white light interferometry
were tried to determine the thickness of chitosan films but were unsuitable
for characterizing wet films. As discussed previously, dehydrated
films do not swell to their original thickness. Thus, combining the
thickness of dry chitosan films with swelling studies was unsuitable
for determining the thickness of wet films obtained by controlling
the drying time before rehydration. Given these challenges, we incorporated
a simplex optimization in our transfer matrix program so that the
refractive index and thickness of the wet chitosan LWs obtained by
controlling the drying time before rehydration could be estimated
on the basis of their experimental reflectivity profiles. The results
are provided in Table 1.

Index Is 1.3317)

10	1.25	1.3597	16.7	126.3	RIS = 16.69 + 1.0959P	
As shown in Table 1, the thickness of the films decreased exponentially
from 2.08 to
1.25 μm as the drying time before rehydration was increased.
The refractive index of the films, on the other hand, went up from
1.3399 to 1.3597 as the dehydration time was increased. The theoretical
RIS of these waveguides (1) for a nonporous film, i.e. only the evanescent
field interacts with the analyte (2) for a fully porous film, i.e.
both the evanescent field and optical mode interact with the analyte,
and (3) as a function of percentage porosity, P,
is also provided in Table 1. While the RIS of nonporous waveguides decreases as the waveguide
thickness increases, the RIS of porous waveguides is largely independent
of their thickness. Additionally, the percentage porosity, P, of the films is likely to be a function of the molecular
weight of analytes. Thus, the RIS of the films will be dependent on
the molecular weight of analytes.

Imaging the pore structure
of wet chitosan films was challenging
using a technique such as SEM that requires dry films along with carbon
coating. We were able to visualize the macroporous structure of the
freeze-dried chitosan films (results not shown), but the mesoporous
structure was damaged as a result of the drying process. Similarly,
confocal microscopy required an oil immersion objective to increase
the imaging resolution but resulted in drying of the chitosan films.
Considering these challenges, diffusion studies were used to determine
the porosity of chitosan films. We recorded the shifts in the resonance
angle of the LW to assess if species are able to diffuse in the chitosan
films.

The films dried for 3 min before rehydration were selected
for
the remaining work because the dip in reflectivity was easily tracked
in real time using a simple, deterministic center of gravity algorithm.
The output of the LW captured using a camera shows that the resonance
angle, which was evident as a black line in Figure S2b, was uniform over 5 mm wide flow channel. The RIS of the
chitosan waveguide for glycerol solutions was 99.3° RIU–1, and its porosity to glycerol solution was estimated to be ∼76%.
The shift in the resonance angle of the waveguide to glycerol and
PEG solutions of different molecular weights is provided in Figure 2 and highlights that
the response of the LW varied minimally over the width of the flow
channel.

Figure 2 Response of chitosan waveguide dried for 3 min before rehydration
(where different traces represent different positions across the width
of the channel).

The estimated porosity
of the film to different molecular weight
analytes is given in Table 2. For example, the difference in the shift in the resonance
angle for PEG 10k was only ∼19% lower than that of glycerol
solution (Figure 2)
and the film was estimated to be ∼56.9% porous to PEG 10k.
This implies that the diameter of ∼56.9% of the pores in the
chitosan film was at least ∼5 nm: i.e., the hydrodynamic diameter
of PEG 10k. Similarly, the diameter of ∼27.5% of the pores
in the chitosan film was at least ∼12 nm: i.e., the hydrodynamic
diameter of PEG 400k. These results demonstrated the feasibility of
producing mesoporous chitosan waveguides by drying the film for 3
min between spin coating and subsequent rehydration.

Chitosan Waveguide Biosensor
To Distinguish between Ferritin
and Apoferritin
Table 2 shows that ΔθR value of the fully
dried chitosan waveguide to PEG 400k was ∼9 times lower than
that of the 3 min dried film. Horse spleen apoferritin is a large
protein with a molecular weight of ∼443 kDa,26 and the protein is able to accommodate up to 4500 iron
atoms in its core.27 The estimated hydrodynamic
diameter of ferritin is ∼12 nm,28 which is comparable to that of PEG 400k. Thus, the waveguide biosensor
comprised of the chitosan film dried for 3 min before rehydration
was used to study apoferritin and ferritin, because the sensitivity
of the partially dried film was expected to be nearly 1 order of magnitude
higher than that of the fully dried film.

Figure 3 shows a typical two-dimensional output of
a dye-doped chitosan waveguide where the x and y axes represent the wavelength and angle of incidence,
respectively. The visualization of the resonance angle was made possible
by doping the waveguide with RB4 that has a significant absorption
over the visible wavelength range. As shown in Figure 3, the resonance angle decreased as the wavelength
increased from 416 to 678 nm because the optical thickness of the
waveguide decreases at long wavelengths. The intensity of light of
wavelength below 450 nm was limited. Thus, the analysis was limited
to the wavelength range between 450 and 678 nm. The resonance angle
changes with wavelength because of the structural dispersion of the
waveguide and the material dispersion of the substrate, waveguide,
and aqueous cover layer. Thus, by measurement of the changes in resonance
angle with wavelength as protein binds to the waveguide, the additional
dispersion introduced by the protein can be determined.

output of the chitosan waveguide sensor obtained
using a white light source and diffraction grating along with camera
assembly.

Pankowska and Dobek29 determined the
refractive index increment at 587.6 nm of ferritin containing between
0 and 1500 iron atoms per protein molecule in sodium chloride solutions,
showing that it varied between ∼1.6 × 10–4 and ∼2.55 × 10–4 g–1, respectively. Since ferritin can contain up to 4500 iron atoms,
the extrapolated refractive index increment would be as high as 4.36
× 10–4 g–1. The ratio of
the ferritin/apoferritin resonance angle shifts from the waveguide
at 586 nm was 2.29 (see inset in Figure 4a), which indicates that our ferritin contained
3375 ± 278 iron atoms per protein. This was confirmed by determining
the average number of iron atoms per molecule of ferritin by recording
the UV–vis absorption spectra of the protein solution. The
extinction coefficients of the ferritin solution used in this work
were estimated to be 3.596 and 0.557 mL mg–1 cm–1 at 280 and 450 nm respectively, resulting in an ε450/ε280 ratio of 0.14. The value reported
in the literature for this ratio is 0.116 for ferritin containing
2950 iron atoms per protein.4 Thus, the
average number of iron atoms per molecule of ferritin used in this
work was estimated to be 3560 on the basis of UV–vis absorption
spectroscopy, which was 5.5% higher than the mean value obtained using
the chitosan waveguide biosensor.

Figure 4 Sensorgrams for (a) apoferritin and (b)
ferritin, where the concentration
of both proteins was 50 μg/mL and the inset shows the shift
in resonance angle (normalized to the shift at 586 nm) after buffer
wash for both proteins as a function of wavelength.

Figure 4 shows the
time response of the waveguide biosensor to (a) apoferritin and (b)
ferritin solutions of the same concentration (50 μg/mL) for
the same time at wavelengths from 456 to 655 nm. It was observed that
the response to apoferritin was considerably lower than that to ferritin,
and ferritin showed greater dispersion than apoferritin. Literature
studies of the refractive index increment of ferritin and apoferritin
have typically been carried out at a single wavelength (usually the
sodium D lines);29 thus, data on the optical
dispersion of ferritin are not available.

To determine the average
iron content of a sample containing ferritin,
different dispersions of ferritin and apoferritin can be used to distinguish
the two species and thus determine the average iron content of each
ferritin molecule. The slope of the normalized resonance angle shift
for apoferritin was −1.29 × 10–4 nm–1, while for ferritin containing 3375 iron atoms per
protein the slope was −1.62 × 10–3 nm–1. Thus, the slope m as a function
of number of iron atoms per ferritin (NFe) is given by 1  

To obtain the average number of iron atoms per ferritin (NFe), we inverted eq 1 to obtain 2  

Using the normalized resonance angle shift permitted the average
number of iron atoms per ferritin (NFe) to be determined independently of the ferritin concentration, while
the absolute resonance angle shift was a measure of total protein
concentration.

To demonstrate the selectivity of the method,
BSA was introduced
on the top of the chitosan waveguide with immobilized antibodies against
ferritin/apoferritin. As shown in Figure 5, the shift in the resonance angle of the
LW as a result of ∼15 μM BSA was ∼0.14° and
was reduced to 0.07° after a buffer wash of duration of ∼500
s. In comparison, the shifts in the resonance angle because of apoferritin
and ferritin (both ∼0.11 μM) following a similar 500
s buffer wash were ∼0.38° and ∼0.76–1.03°,
respectively. The measurement of ferritin/apoferritin was taken after
a buffer wash, which would largely remove any nonspecifically bound
sample components. This implies that the response of the chitosan
waveguide with immobilized antibodies to nonspecific interactions
was minimal and the method is selective toward ferritin/apoferritin.

of the LW to BSA solution.

Conclusions
A method of determining the iron content
of ferritin has been demonstrated
that does not rely on separate determination of iron and protein but
instead uses the differences in dispersion between ferritin and apoferritin
to perform this measurement in a single step. The use of antibodies
in the waveguide provides both selectivity and sensitivity and thus
allows interfering species to be removed by washing before measurements
are performed. The method is an advance over the the state of the
art method, ELISA, because it directly determines the iron content
of ferritin. The method of preserving the porosity of chitosan waveguides
by rehydration after a suitable time delay post spin-coating improved
the measurement sensitivity by a factor of 9. The reported analytical
method for determining average iron content of ferritin when it is
integrated with suitable sample preparation steps will be highly suitable
for point of care applications.
