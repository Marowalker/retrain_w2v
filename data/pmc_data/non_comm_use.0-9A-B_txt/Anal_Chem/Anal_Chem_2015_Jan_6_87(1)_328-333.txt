Imaging
with cluster secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is
reaching a mature level of development. Using a variety of molecular
ion projectiles to stimulate desorption, 3-dimensional imaging with
the selectivity of mass spectrometry can now be achieved with submicrometer
spatial resolution and <10 nm depth resolution. In this Perspective,
stock is taken regarding what it will require to routinely achieve
these remarkable properties. Issues include the chemical nature of
the projectile, topography formation, differential erosion rates,
and perhaps most importantly, ionization efficiency. Shortcomings
of existing instrumentation are also noted. Speculation about how
to successfully resolve these issues is a key part of the discussion.

==== Body
The emergence
of mass spectrometry
imaging has, in recent years, allowed chemical composition to be resolved
with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity. This capability
has had implications not only for bioimaging but also for characterizing
polymer surfaces, medical devices, electronic components, and organic
light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Initially, this type of measurement
was limited to energetic ion beam induced desorption experiments emanating
from the secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) community.1 Although molecular information is obtainable
with this method, significant beam-induced chemical fragmentation
causes experimental complications and often makes spectral interpretation
problematic. More recently, imaging using focused laser beams to initiate
molecular desorption has become widespread using MALDI2 or laser ablation with electrospray postionization where
fragmentation is much more controllable.3 Other soft desorption probes that can be spatially confined have
also been tested in the imaging mode including desorption electrospray
ionization (DESI).4

Here, the focus
is on molecular SIMS. It is valid to question the
efficacy of this approach, however, in light of the transformational
advances associated with related mass spectrometry imaging motifs
where molecular fragmentation is much less pronounced. As I shall
try to show, there are critical operational modes for SIMS that put
it in a unique space for materials characterization. These modes include
the ability to acquire chemical information specific to the surface
layers of a sample and to perform 3-dimensional imaging with submicrometer
spatial resolution and nanometer-scale depth resolution. This approach
is distinct from nanoSIMS where the energetic ion beam intentionally
fragments the molecules to small fragments which are distinguished
using stable isotope labeling.5

The
reason d’être for this Perspective stems from
the remarkable developments associated with primary ion cluster projectiles
for SIMS experiments. About 10 years ago, I penned a report for Analytical Chemistry entitled “The Magic of Cluster
SIMS”, espousing the virtues of C60 as a projectile.6 At that time, SIMS researchers were rapidly shifting
their emphasis from atomic projectiles like Ar+ and Ga+ to cluster projectiles. It was clear then that when many
atoms are involved in a collision with the surface, the energy per
atom is reduced proportionately and the incident energy is deposited
closer to the surface where it most effectively stimulates desorption.7 In addition, there was some evidence that these
clusters initiated much less subsurface damage than atomic projectiles.
Cluster ion beams could be employed to erode material from the sample
in a highly controlled fashion, allowing molecular composition to
be determined in depth with a resolution of less than 20 nm.8 In addition, these beams are readily focused
to a submicrometer spot, allowing much higher spatial resolution than
the desorption techniques mentioned above. Hence, this new paradigm
holds out the enticing prospect of acquiring molecule-specific images
of a range of materials with no special pretreatment and in 3 dimensions.
The ability for molecular depth profiling, molecular surface analyses,
and submicrometer molecular imaging is the unique characteristic that
spurs continued interest in instrumental improvements, better fundamental
understanding, and unusual applications. With this perspective in
mind, the goal here is to reflect upon key discoveries that have led
to current capabilities, highlight critical areas of difficulty that
prevent further advances, and speculate about how these roadblocks
can be cleared away.

Cluster Beams and Their Implications
Today, the development of the protocols necessary to implement
3-dimensional imaging has advanced at a remarkable pace.9 Virtually every SIMS lab has implemented cluster
ion beams of one type or another. The situation is complicated, however,
since there are a wide range of cluster projectiles, each with a particular
advantage for a particular aspect of the measurement. The liquid metal
ion gun, for example, is favored for high spatial resolution and brightness
since the ions are emitted from a point source. Bismuth is the favored
projectile since it has material properties that allow it to be focused
to a spot well-below 100 nm.10 In addition,
Bi readily forms clusters during the emission process with Bi3+ being the most popular species. Another approach
is to directly ionize a molecule by conventional electron impact with
20–70 eV electrons and to focus the extracted primary molecular
ion using lenses and apertures. This is the approach used for the
C60+ ion source mentioned above.11 A major downside is that focusing is difficult
due to the relatively large size of the ionization region. Although
spot sizes of 250 nm have been reached with this approach, the extensive
use of apertures greatly reduces the beam current. The upside is that
a wide range of molecular species can be employed to optimize molecular
desorption, ionization, or spatial resolution. In addition, it may
be possible to utilize both the kinetic energy of the cluster for
desorption and subsequent chemical reactions that may occur between
the cluster components and the sample. Possible chemical reactions
include the formation of volatile intermediates and ionization via
proton attachment. A summary of some of the most intensely studied
cluster projectiles is shown in Table 1.

The development of the argon gas cluster ion beam
(GCIB) shown
in Table 1 deserves special mention in this
Perspective. This source has been of interest to the community for
many years after initial experiments reported by the Matsuo group
at Kyoto University.18 Using supersonic
expansion of high pressure argon gas through a nozzle, clusters of
up to 10,000 argon atoms could be prepared and ionized by the electron
impact method noted above. When employed as a SIMS primary ion, this
projectile was shown to desorb biomolecules with much less fragmentation
than produced by other smaller clusters. The depth resolution in molecular
depth profiling experiments was also much improved.19 Even so, the source was not employed by other groups due
to design complexity. About 5 years ago, however, several instrument
companies managed to produce a compact design that could be retrofitted
onto existing TOF-SIMS instruments. Interest in the new source has
been phenomenal, with widespread adoption by the community.

Molecular
Depth Profiling and Topography
One of the first challenges
for molecular depth profiling and 3-dimensional
imaging experiments is to determine the depth scale during ion-beam
induced erosion. From the mass spectrometry side, the number of primary
ions is easily determined simply by measuring the beam current. The
tougher part is to determine how much material is removed during each
impact, and if this amount changes during the experiment due to different
material properties, how does one correct for such effects? A useful
approach for simple systems is to create a crater with the primary
ion beam and measure the volume of the crater using atomic force microscopy
(AFM). Very accurate yield measurements can be obtained with AFM on
well-behaved samples, and much has been learned about the physics
of the desorption process from these measurements. A typical crater
is shown in Figure 1. Not only is it easy to
calculate the volume, but it is possible to acquire information about
any topography that may form during the erosion process. In some instances,
the amount of material can be determined by a simple weight loss measurement
using the quartz crystal microbalance.20

340 μm square and 220 nm deep. Note the small amount of roughness

Any roughening of the crater floor will introduce
uncertainty in
the depth measurement and will degrade the ultimate depth resolution.
Fortunately, using most cluster projectiles, the microscopic roughness
tends to decrease or at least to remain only a few nanometers, as
a function of bombardment fluence. This observation is nicely reproduced
using computer simulations of the sputtering event, which suggest
that the rms roughness varies from 1 to 4 nm, depending upon projectile,
angle of incidence, and kinetic energy. An example of how these simulations
reveal nanoscopic roughness is shown in Figure 2.22 Since the roughness often develops
along the direction of the impact azimuthal angle for oblique angles
of incidence, rotation of the sample during erosion has been suggested
and shown to be a viable approach to reducing any topography formation
even further.23

Molecular Depth Profiling of Hybrid Materials
Fundamental studies of molecular depth profiling very quickly revealed
a critical problem. Bombardment of organic materials with cluster
ion beams almost always occurs with a yield volume an order of magnitude
larger than for inorganic materials such as metals or metal oxides.
For example, the sputtering yield of cholesterol was found to be 274
nm3 per C60 impact, while that of Au was found
to be only 2.2 nm3 under similar conditions.24 In addition, when the metal is on top of the
organic layer, it is observed to implant into the organic matrix,
resulting in a reduced sputtering yield, increased molecular fragmentation,
and an increase in the thickness of a beam-induced altered layer at
the eroding surface.

A very important application of molecular
depth profiling is the
characterization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) devices. As
it turns out, molecular depth profiles of two important OLED organic
components, 4,4′-bis[N-(1-naphthyl-1-)-N-phenyl- amino]-biphenyl (NPB) and aluminum tris(8-hydroxyquinolate)
(Alq3), yield nearly artifact-free results.25 The depth resolution of Alq3 marker
layers embedded in an NPB matrix is ∼10 nm as shown in Figure 3. The actual device, however, is overcoated with
a thin layer of Al. In order to successfully depth profile through
these layers, the Al coating must be physically removed at the start,
typically by pulling it off with scotch tape. One could imagine that
any hybrid material would yield similar artifacts. Interestingly,
one approach to resolving the problem has involved depth profiling
by cobombardment with a high energy C60+ probe
and a very low energy Ar+ probe.26 With this configuration, the Al layer could be removed without complications.
Although this approach has been questioned, perhaps this sort of scheme
can be generalized to further broaden the scope of this type of measurement.

structure, whose schematic is shown on the right. Alq3 is
purple, and NPB is orange. The Alq3 layers are 3 nm thick. Reprinted with permsission

Implications for Bioimaging
Since differential erosion rates
can put a damper on molecular
depth profiling and 3-dimensional molecular imaging, it is logical
to question whether this approach is meaningful for characterizing
single biological cells. Certainly, the goal of performing this type
of measurement has been a cause célèbre for SIMS users
since the early 1990s. More recently, however, several groups have
proposed protocols for 3-dimensional measurements that again utilize
the AFM to determine the depth scale in order to account for yield
variations. The Castner lab has shown that, for formalin-fixed HeLa
cells, the erosion rate is 4 nm per 1013 C60 ions (40 nm3 per C60 impact) at 10 keV.9b To achieve submicrometer spatial resolution,
they employed the Bi3+ ion source for imaging.
The cells were treated with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a well-known
nuclear marker, to ensure that the images were representative of the
intact cell. Their results show that the sputter rate is constant
during the C60+ erosion, suggesting that the
chemical nature of the cell is uniform enough to prevent the distortions
associated with the organic/inorganic hybrid systems mentioned above.
Because of the uniform erosion rate, they could apply a simple z-correction to the 2-dimensional images to create an accurate
3-dimensional representation, shown in Figure 4. This correction is an important transformation to accurately account
for the erosion of nonflat samples.27 It
is important to try to generalize these observations to other cell
types and cell-preparation methods, since the assumption of uniform
erosion is central to the success of this approach. For example, attempts
to depth profile single biological cells with embedded TiOx nanoparticles yield a three-dimensional image with
a greatly distorted depth scale, illustrated in Figure 5.28

Ionization, Ionization, and Ionization!
In addition to understanding
the physical aspects of molecular
sputtering, it is equally important to maximize molecular ionization
during sputtering and to minimize the notorious matrix ionization
effects. It is generally stated that the probability of ionization
for typical organic molecules is in the range of 1 molecule in 108 to 1 molecule in 104, although values outside
this range can be found. Ionization is a rare event, with most of
the sputtered flux consisting of neutral molecules and fragments.
This fact obviously has an enormous influence on ultimate sensitivity,
but perhaps even more importantly, it limits the spatial resolution
that can be achieved. There are only a million molecules (of typical
size) per layer per square micrometer. If several layers can be added
together during erosion, the sample volume could approach a billion
molecules. With an ionization probability of 1 part in 108, however, it is clear that there simply is not enough material to
detect a signal, even with the most efficient mass spectrometers,
as the pixel size decreases into the nanometer range.

The ionization
problem effects the situation in other ways as well.
With smaller cluster projectiles such as Bi3+, ions are produced in greater quantity, but more molecules are fragmented,
reducing the molecular ionization efficiency. With the larger clusters,
such as the GCIB beams shown in Table 1, molecular
desorption is very efficient, but the “softness” of
the ionization means that the ionization efficiency is poor. We are
faced with a classic conundrum. It seems that the only way out is
to figure out new ways to enhance molecular ionization during projectile
impact. Implementation of matrices as with MALDI might be helpful
in this regard,29 but this approach is
not compatible with molecular depth profiling and 3-dimensional imaging,
obviating much of the uniqueness of modern day SIMS. Another strategy
is to tinker with the chemistry of the GCIB projectile, itself. That
is the thinking behind the development of proton rich GCIBs such as
H2O17 or doped GCIBs containing
hydrogen-rich small molecules such as CH4.30 Presumably, these H atoms wind up as embedded protons after
projectile impact to enhance [M + H]+ formation. Finally,
it is possible to employ both ion sources simultaneously. The Bi3+ source is used for spectral acquisition and imaging,
while the GCIB is employed purely for erosion and depth information.31 These approaches all appear promising with ionization
enhancements of an order of magnitude or so, but more is needed.

The other remaining difficulty with ionization involves dreaded
matrix ionization effects. For organic molecules, there can be interactions
between sputtered ions that enhance one component and suppress another.
Since the ionization mechanism usually involves proton attachment,
the magnitude of these effects is often related to the relative gas
phase basicity of the two components. It has been shown that the intensity
of a drug molecule in various portions of brain tissue is high where
it should be low and low where it should be high due to interactions
between the drug and the lipid components in the tissue.32 More recent studies have investigated ion suppression
effects quantitatively using thermally evaporated thin film structures
of multicomponent organic species. These experiments showed that low
molecular weight fragment ions exhibited much smaller matrix effects
than the heavier molecular ions. In addition, a simple model was introduced
which, using pure component standards as reference, allowed correction
for matrix effects and allowed accurate compositional analysis of
binary organic mixtures.33 This approach
represents an important beginning for unraveling these effects in
more complex materials such as biological cells and tissue.

Implications
for Instrumentation
These recent developments in cluster-SIMS
have altered the instrumentation
landscape. Prior to molecular depth profiling and 3-dimensional imaging,
instrumentation was designed for optimum transmission using time-of-flight
mass analyzers. With this configuration, the ion beam dose is kept
small to avoid the accumulation of chemical damage on the sample surface,
although detection efficiency is maximized.34 The primary ion beam is pulsed with a duty cycle of ∼1 part
in 106. The requirement for a pulsed beam also means that
high spatial resolution and high mass resolution is not easily obtained
at the same time. With the lifting of the dose restriction, the use
of modern mass spectrometer designs has become feasible. A C60 source has been coupled to a hybrid triple-quadrupole orthogonal
TOF.35 This design utilizes a continuous
primary ion beam and provides direct access to tandem mass spectrometry
studies. The continuous ion beam is important since the duty cycle
is, in principle, 100%, and high spatial resolution and high mass
resolution can be achieved at the same time. Another innovative design
has appeared which employs a shaped-field buncher to time focus a
section of the continuous beam which is accelerated into a harmonic
reflectron.36 Other groups are working
on using Fourier transform mass analyzers37 to achieve ultrahigh mass resolution.

There is now a major
initiative that addresses many of the issues
raised here, with the goal of increasing the ionization efficiency
by 2 orders of magnitude and of providing label-free molecular imaging
in 3 dimensions with 50 nm spatial resolution. (http://www.npl.co.uk/news/3d-nanosims-label-free-molecular-imaging) The initiative, led by researchers at the National Physical Lab
in the UK, involves a collaboration between two prominent instrument
companies, industry, as well as academic institutions in both the
UK and the US. The strategy targets the two-ion-gun approach to maximize
ionization with reduced damage, laser postionization to maximize ionization
efficiency, and the implementation of an orbitrap device for ultrahigh
mass resolution with tandem mass spectrometry capabilities. The goal
of this new instrument is to identify where drugs go at the single
cell level, even within specific organelles.

What Next?
From
this Perspective, it is hopefully clear that a continuous
stream of technical developments have relentlessly improved the characteristics
of SIMS, bringing it to the present advanced state. When looking at
the 50 year history of contributions, it is easy to see that SIMS
was an important precursor to the modern revolution in mass spectrometry
starting with the invention of MALDI and electrospray methods in the
1980s.38 This history suggests that more
advances are still to come. As noted above, there is still no consensus
about the most effective primary cluster projectile where ionization
efficiency, depth resolution, and spatial resolution are optimized.
Depth scale issues and matrix ionization effects seem destined to
be worked out to most people’s satisfaction. The elephant in
the room remains to be the poor ionization efficiency, which ultimately
limits spatial resolution. Clever breakthroughs are urgently needed
to resolve this problem, which will require better fundamental understanding
of the basic ionization mechanisms themselves. For example, can the
chemistry of the projectile be optimized to enhance ionization during
a single impact event, or will chemical modification of the sample
surface through many impacts be required?
