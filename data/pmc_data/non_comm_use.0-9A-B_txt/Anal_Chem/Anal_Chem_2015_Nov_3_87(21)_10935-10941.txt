Thermal processes are widely used
in small molecule chemical analysis
and metabolomics for derivatization, vaporization, chromatography,
and ionization, especially in gas chromatography mass spectrometry
(GC/MS). In this study the effect of heating was examined on a set
of 64 small molecule standards and, separately, on human plasma metabolite
extracts. The samples, either derivatized or underivatized, were heated
at three different temperatures (60, 100, and 250 °C) at different
exposure times (30 s, 60 s, and 300 s). All the samples were analyzed
by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
(LC/MS) and the data processed by XCMS Online (xcmsonline.scripps.edu). The results showed that heating at an elevated temperature of
100 °C had an appreciable effect on both the underivatized and
derivatized molecules, and heating at 250 °C created substantial
changes in the profile. For example, over 40% of the molecular peaks
were altered in the plasma metabolite analysis after heating (250
°C, 300s) with a significant formation of degradation and transformation
products. The analysis of 64 small molecule standards validated the
temperature-induced changes observed on the plasma metabolites, where
most of the small molecules degraded at elevated temperatures even
after minimal exposure times (30 s). For example, tri- and diorganophosphates
(e.g., adenosine triphosphate and adenosine diphosphate) were readily
degraded into a mono-organophosphate (e.g., adenosine monophosphate)
during heating. Nucleosides and nucleotides (e.g., inosine and inosine
monophosphate) were also found to be transformed into purine derivatives
(e.g., hypoxanthine). A newly formed transformation product, oleoyl
ethyl amide, was identified in both the underivatized and derivatized
forms of the plasma extracts and small molecule standard mixture,
and was likely generated from oleic acid. Overall these analyses show
that small molecules and metabolites undergo significant time-sensitive
alterations when exposed to elevated temperatures, especially those
conditions that mimic sample preparation and analysis in GC/MS experiments.

Small molecule
analysis has
become increasingly important across a broad range of research areas,
including drug discovery,1 microbiology,2 plant physiology,3 nutrition,4 and the environmental sciences.5 It has been applied to examine pathophysiological
processes,6 biomarker discovery,7,8 and unknown biological pathways.9 Over
the past decade, metabolomic sample preparation, analytical techniques,
and data analysis platforms have been maturing rapidly, with the most
widely used analytical techniques being nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (NMR) and hyphenated methods such as gas and liquid chromatography
mass spectrometry (GC/MS and LC/MS). Due to their high sensitivity
and resolution, MS-based technologies have become increasingly popular.
GC/MS, in particular, combines excellent separation with sensitive
mass detection. Also, the extensive and reproducible fragmentation
patterns in the electron ionization (EI) source used in GC/MS can
readily identify or classify small molecule metabolites. In contrast,
LC/MS provides softer ionization; electrospray ionization (ESI) or
atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) facilitate intact
molecular ion formation and metabolite characterization with tandem
mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Together, GC/MS and LC/MS/MS, when combined
with the existing libraries (e.g., NIST,10 HMDB,11 LipidMaps,12 and METLIN13) have been increasingly
applied to metabolomics and small molecule analysis in general.

One of the most significant challenges in generating accurate molecular
profiles is maintaining the stability of molecules. Many small molecules,
metabolites, or their intermediates are labile and can potentially
undergo degradation during sample handling, including storage, extraction,
and analysis. Temperature control is one of the key aspects of metabolomic
experiments. For example, an NMR study showed that urine sample storage
at different temperatures, i.e., room temperature (22 °C), refrigeration
(4 °C), and low temperature freezing (−80 °C), can
affect metabolite stability over time.14 In another study, plasma samples left at room temperature for 2.5
h had a significant impact on choline compound stability,15 albeit both studies were based on the chemical
analysis of a limited set of metabolites. While lower temperatures
are typically used to store compounds (as described above), the use
of heat can have an even greater impact on the thousands of metabolites
present in a biological sample. For example, derivatization at elevated
temperatures is widely used in GC/MS analysis, where the reactions
are usually conducted at 60 °C for several hours.16,17 In newborn screening, reactions between the derivatization reagent
and amino acids from dried blood spots are heated to 60–80
°C for over 30 min.18,19 High temperatures are
also used during the desolvation (vaporization temperature: 200–350
°C) and ionization processes (e.g., APCI) for LC/MS analysis,
though the residence time is short. More importantly, heating is widely
used in GC/MS analysis to facilitate gas phase generation and separation
of metabolites from a sample. In a standard GC/MS method recommended
in the user guideline of the GC/MS Metabolomics Library,16 the GC oven is ramped by 10 °C/min from
60 °C (1 min initial time) to 325 °C (10 min final time),
resulting in a 37.5 min run time at elevated temperatures. Also, high
temperatures are used in the injector (250 °C) and MS transfer
line (290 °C). Interestingly, at least half of the metabolite
peaks typically elute after 17 min when the calculated oven temperature
is over 200 °C.20

Figure 1 Global molecular profiling
approach used to investigate heating
on small molecule stability.

To date, very little information is available on the effect
of
heating on small molecules and metabolites. In a previous GC/MS study
analyzing human plasma metabolites, about 40% of the observed peaks
remained unidentified even after annotation using a metabolite library.21 This relatively low level of identification
is a common problem in global untargeted GC/MS metabolomic studies.
While the lack of a comprehensive GC/MS library for human metabolites
could explain this, it is possible that some of the metabolite peaks
are formed due to derivatization byproducts or unknown metabolites
formed at the high temperatures.

Since many small molecules
contain polar functional groups and
are thermally labile at the temperatures required for their vaporization
and separation, derivatization prior to GC analysis is needed to extend
the application of GC-based methods. The majority of GC methods derivatize
with an oximation reagent followed by silylation,17,22 or alternatively, chloroformates are used.23 The derivatization step is designed to protect the small molecules
from degrading at high GC/MS temperatures. However, to date, no direct
experimental evidence is available to confirm this hypothesis.

Furthermore, the derivatization efficiency can vary greatly between
small molecules, as shown by Koek et al.24 When using the most common derivatization agents, ethoxyamine hydrochloride
and N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)
trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA), the derivatization efficiency of the amino
acids alanine and tryptophan was 100% and 30%, respectively, and for
fumaric acid and fructose 6-phosphate it was 60% and 45%, respectively.24 Therefore, a substantial portion of those small
molecule standard mixtures contained the nonderivatized form when
injected onto the GC/MS. Given the broad use of GC/MS, it is important
to investigate the fate and transformation of those small molecules
during the heating process in the sample preparation and instrumental
analysis.

In this study, we designed a set of experiments (Figure 1) to examine the
global changes
that occur at three different temperatures commonly used for small
molecule sample preparation and analysis (60, 100, and 250 °C).
Specifically, we examined the effect of heating on the stability of
small molecules by observing the global metabolomic profile (using
HPLC-ESI-QTOF/MS) of human plasma metabolite extracts and a standard
mixture of 64 small molecules including amino acids, purines, sugars,
sugar phosphates, and free fatty acids.

Experimental Section
Sample
Preparation and Derivatization
The suppliers
of all the chemicals and solvents were fully described in Supporting Information (SI) Text S1. A stock
of standard human serum was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Catalog No.:
H4522, human male AB plasma, USA origin, sterile-filtered). Plasma
metabolites were extracted using a solvent mixture of acetonitrile
and methanol. Aliquots of 200 μL serum was extracted with 800
μL ice-cold acetonitrile:methanol (1:1, v/v). The mixture was
sonicated for 5 min and incubated for 1 h at −20 °C to
precipitate the protein, which was followed by 15 min centrifugation
at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was removed
and combined together as a stock sample for the following experiments.
Subsequently, ∼ 240 μL of the sample, which was equivalent
to ∼60 μL plasma, was aliquoted into amber silylated
GC vials and evaporated to dryness in a vacuum concentrator. The derivatization
step was modified from several previous studies17,22,25 and was accepted as the standard method
in the derivatization of GC/MS based metabolomics methods. In brief,
∼ 100 μL of toluene (dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate)
was added to the dry sample, mixed for 1 min and dried again in the
vacuum concentrator for 20 min. To the dried metabolite sample, 50
μL of fresh methoxylamine (MOX) reagent (20 mg/mL) was added
and the samples incubated in the oven at 60 °C for 2 h. Subsequently,
100 μL of BSTFA with 1% (v/v) trimethylchlorosilane (TCMS) was
rapidly added to each sample and the mixture was incubated for 1 h
at 60 °C to form trimethylsilylated (TMS) derivatives.

Prior to heating, all the plasma small molecule metabolites were
extracted and evaporated to dryness using a vacuum concentrator. All
the vials were capped with a Teflon coated GC inlet septum which showed
high temperature resistance and little background during heating.
To minimize possible oxidation during heating, the vials were flushed
with high purity nitrogen. For the underivatized plasma metabolites,
heating at three different temperatures at 60, 100, and 250 °C
was conducted. To observe the temporal change, samples were collected
after heating for 30, 60, and 300 s. For the derivatized plasma metabolites,
250 °C at 30, 60, and 300 s was used. For the standard mixture,
only 250 °C at 60 and 300s was used to compare against room temperature
(25 °C) for both the underivatized and derivatized mixture because
fewer features were observed at 60 and 100 and 250 °C 30 s. At
each temperature and time point, triplicate biological replicates
together with a blank control were prepared. After heating, 60 μL
acetonitrile/H2O (1:1, v/v) was spiked into each vial and
vortex-mixed after cooling down. Then 15 min centrifugation at 13,000
rpm at 4 °C was used to precipitate the insoluble particles and
the supernatants were transferred to microvolume inserts prior to
analysis.

Sample Analysis
The analysis of samples using HPLC-ESI-QTOF/MS
in both reversed phase chromatography ESI positive mode (RP-ESI (+))
and hydrophilic interaction chromatography ESI negative mode (HILIC-
ESI (−)) was detailed in Text S-2. The data analysis and quality
control were described in Text S-3 and S-4.

Results and Discussion
Global
Profiling of Heated Plasma Metabolites
As shown
in Figures 1 and 2, separate sets of plasma extracts were each heated
at 60 °C, 100 °C, and 250 °C for three different time
periods (30 s, 60 s, and 300 s). Generally it was observed that heating
at high temperatures has a significant effect on the small molecules,
as reflected in the percentage of total altered features in the plasma
metabolites (Figure 2-a and S-1 (a)). Specifically, relatively
few altered features were observed for the samples heated at 60 °C
during all heating periods compared to the control at room temperature,
25 °C. At 100 °C heating for 300 s, 18% of the total aligned
features were altered. As shown in Figure S-2 (b), small molecule metabolites heated at 100 °C for 300
s were also clearly separated from other conditions in the PCA plot.
However, no significant alterations were observed for the molecules
exposed to the shorter heating periods (30 s and 60 s). At a heating
temperature of 250 °C, significantly higher number of features
were altered (Figure 2-a and S-1 (a)). The percentages of altered
features were 14%, 21%, and 51%, for 30 s, 60 s, and 300 s exposure
time, respectively, most of which were observed by RP-ESI (+). As
shown in Figure 1,
the total ion chromatography (TIC) of the plasma metabolites heated
at 250 °C was visually distinct from the 25 °C control.
The greatest increase in altered features was observed in the sample
heated for 300 s and the features were widely distributed along the
entire gradient on the C18-RP column (Figure 3-a).

Interestingly, the numbers of
upregulated features increased dramatically with the longer heating
period and over 50% of the total altered features were upregulated.
The majority of altered features were not previously observed, suggesting
the formation of new molecules at high temperature. These newly formed
metabolites may represent either the breakdown byproducts or de novo chemically produced small molecules under the high
temperature. This finding could also explain the presence of many
unknown peaks in the GC/MS analysis of the plasma extracts.

Several metabolites were further analyzed to validate the observed
temperature-induced alterations. Glutamate, linoleic acid, and PC
(16:0/0:0) were selected due to their high abundance and important
roles in biochemistry. As shown in Figures 3b and c and S-3, these molecules degraded to different extents. While no significant
change was observed at 60 and 100 °C during three heating periods,
most of glutamate and PC (16:0/0:0) were absent after heating at 250
°C for 300 s. Glutamate seems to be among the most labile compounds.
Approximately half degraded within 30 s, with complete degradation
after 60 s. This finding is consistent with previous results that
demonstrated thermal degradation of amino and organic acids.26 Linoleic acid gradually degraded under 250 °C
heating, and ∼50% disappeared after heating for 60 s (Figure S3). PC (16:0/0:0) did not show a significant
decrease after heating at 250 °C for 60 s; though it decreased
rapidly after 300 s.

Figure 2 Percentage of altered (both upregulated and downregulated)
features
compared to the total features in the underivatized and derivatized
plasma small molecule metabolites heated at 60 °C, 100 °C,
and 250 °C for 30 s, 60 s, and 300 s. The subsequent analyses
were performed using (a) RP-ESI (+) and overall results displayed
with (b) principal component analysis scores plots of 25 and 250 °C
for 300 s heated metabolites. All the upregulated and downregulated
features were from pairwise comparison of each tested condition with
room temperature (25 °C) and filtered using p < 0.01.

Global Profiling of Heated
Plasma Metabolites after Derivatization
To explore the effect
of derivatization on the plasma metabolome,
the dry extracts were derivatized by the most widely used method,
silylation, and then heated at 250 °C at different times. Overall,
the profile of the derivatized small molecules was altered greatly
after heating at 250 °C and the derivatization did not effectively
protect the metabolites. As shown in Table S2, the percentages of the altered features to the total features were
27%, 41%, and 65% for 30 s, 60 s, and 300 s of heating at 250 °C,
respectively. Furthermore, the derivatized small molecules showed
a similar time course effect to the underivatized plasma at 250 °C.
The PCA scores plot in Figure S-2 (d) shows
that the feature variance could be well explained by two principal
components and the plasma profiles were well grouped depending on
sample preparation (heating and derivatization factor). Derivatization
did not prevent temperature-induced changes. However, it was interesting
to find that the percentage of the upregulated features (∼35%
in Table S2) decreased in total in the
derivatized plasma metabolites, compared with the underivatized plasma
metabolites exposed to the same heating effect. This suggests that
derivatization might decrease the de novo formation
of new compounds from the breakdown or chemical reaction between metabolites.

Degradation of Underivatized and Derivatized
Small Molecule
Standards
Since many of the central carbon metabolites showed
low signal intensities from the plasma sample, we prepared a mixture
of 64 small molecules to examine the heating effect using similar
experimental conditions. As shown in Figure 4 and Table S-3, heating greatly alters the global profile for both the underivatized
and derivatized small molecule mixtures. PCA revealed that the underivatized
standards were distinct from each other when treated with different
temperatures at different times (25 °C control, 250 °C 60
s, and 250 °C 300 s) (See Figure S-4 (b)). The RP-ESI (+) and HILIC-ESI (−) data sets increased by
52% and 57% for the 60 s and 300 s heating at 250 °C, respectively.
Approximately half of the altered features increased across the retention
time window between 10 and 40 min on the C18 column (Figure S-4 (a)). It should also be noted that analysis of
these samples using LC-ESI-MS provided an important alternative for
examining the heating effect in GC/MS, since GC/MS requires heating
to facilitate thermal vaporization.

Overall, heating at high
temperature (250 °C) greatly altered the profile of both the
standards and plasma metabolites after derivatization. However, more
changes were observed from the plasma extracts, likely due to its
higher complexity with thousands of metabolites. For example, it is
known that many plasma lipids have not yet been well characterized.27 The derivatization efficacy for those metabolites
is not known, and their breakdown byproducts could affect the global
profiling of the plasma extracts.

It is worth noting that derivatization
efficiency was also investigated
to examine the effect on the global profile. The silylation derivatization
method used has been widely applied in GC/MS based global metabolomics17,20 and in the quantification of many types of metabolites.24 The derivatization efficiency was estimated
by comparing the samples before and after derivatization at room temperature
(25 °C). As shown in Table S-1, the
derivatization efficiency differed greatly among small molecules.
Some of the small molecules could be efficiently derivatized, such
as ATP, nucleotide sugar, free fatty acids, and metabolites associated
with glycolysis. However, the derivatization efficiency was less than
50% for some molecules in the pathways of purine metabolism (e.g.,
adenosine and uric acid) and amino acid synthesis (e.g., tyrosine
and cysteine sulfate). Some molecules, including UMP, xanthine, and
arginine, could not be derivatized at all. This result was consistent
with a previous study in which the derivatization efficiency significantly
differed between compounds.24

molecule mixture heated with 250 °C for 30, 60, and 300 s using

heated at 250 °C for 60 s compared with 25 °C are shown.
Error bars show standard deviation (based on triplicates).

Degradation of Small Molecule Standards
Most of the
selected small molecule standards degraded rapidly at 250 °C,
as summarized in Table S-1. The small organic
acids (e.g., citric acid and malate), amino acid intermediates (e,g.,
aminoadipic acid and saccharopine), amides (e.g., glutamate), and
several energy currency metabolites (e.g., NAD+, NADH, phospheoenol
pyruvate, and acetyl-CoA) disappeared after 60 s of heating at 250
°C, suggesting that those molecules were particularly unstable.
Consistent with the observation in the plasma extracts, fatty acids
tended to be more stable. For the triphosphate nucleotides (See Figure 5C–E and Table S-1), such as ATP, UTP, and GTP, no detectable
concentration was left after heating for 60 s, which was followed
by similar degradation of their diphosphate metabolites.

We
also observed that some molecules initially increased and then decreased
over time. For example, the relative abundance of several monophosphates
(i.e., AMP, CMP, GMP, and UMP) experienced an increase during the
first 60 s and then decreased dramatically up to 300 s (Figures 5-C and D and Table S-1), suggesting that triphosphates and diphosphates
could be degraded into monophosphate analogues as suggested in Figure 5-A. The level of
uridine also increased after heating the mixture for 60 s at 250 °C
(∼1.4 times higher than at 25 °C, Table S-1) and did not experience any significant drop after
300 s of heating, suggesting that the parent compounds such as UMP,
UDP, or UMP break down to uridine. Though it is known that triphosphates
are relatively unstable, this study for the first time showed triphosphates
could be converted sequentially to monophosphates or even nucleosides
during the heating process. The triphosphate metabolites such as ATP
play an important role in the biological pathways, and dysregulation
has been related with many diseases (e.g., Parkinson’s disease).28 For example, the ratio between intercellular
ATP and AMP has been used to estimate the malfunction of the mitochondria
dysfunction during aging and pathology.29 This study showed that conversion from ATP to AMP during sample
treatment should be considered in future studies and very careful
steps should be conducted to avoid the breakdown of ATP.

Another
interesting observation was the increase of several tested
molecules, including hypoxanthine and uric acid during heating. For
example, the level of hypoxanthine after heating for 300 s at 250
°C was 2.8 times higher than the 25 °C control. Several
molecules could contribute as the sources of this increase. Small
molecules such as inosine (decreased over 70% after 60 s at 250 °C, Figure 5-e) and inosine monophosphate
(IMP), both containing hypoxanthine, could potentially breakdown to
generate hypoxanthine during the heating process. The deamination
of adenine could also be a possible source for hypoxanthine.30 The steady concentration of xanthine and slight
increase of uric acid after heating might be from other conversion
processes such as oxidation of hypoxanthine. A possible pathway is
shown in Figure 5-B.
To further validate these changes, we conducted thermal sensitivity
experiments on individual compounds of ATP, inosine, and IMP at 150
and 250 °C with higher temporal resolution (30 s, 60 s, 120 s,
and 300 s). As shown in Figure S5, ATP
was readily degraded to ADP and AMP at both 150 and 250 °C, which
could be further degraded into adenosine and adenine at 250 °C.
Again, a gradual increase of hypoxanthine was observed in the heating
of inosine and IMP at 250 °C (no change at 150 °C). In general,
the results in this study using both metabolite mixtures and individual
compounds consistently showed the interconversion of many small molecules
during heating, ultimately adding to the complexity of the global
metabolomic experimental results.

Identification of de Novo Byproducts Formed
during Heating
Many upregulated features were observed for
both the heated plasma metabolite and the standard mixture, some of
which were not detected in the control samples at 25 °C, suggesting
the formation of new products during heating. To help characterize
and identify the de novo generated byproducts during
heating, we have performed targeted MS/MS for several of the most
significantly altered features. Sixty targeted precursor ions were
examined in both ESI (+) and ESI (−), and the resulting MS/MS
fragments were searched. Most of the targeted MS/MS fragments gave
no hits in the METLIN database or provided a very low match score,
suggesting the heating byproducts were not common human metabolites.
Interestingly, one possible byproduct was identified as oleoyl ethyl
amide from the 250 °C heated standard mixture and the plasma
metabolites and was further confirmed with a pure standard. As shown
in Figure S-6, it was rapidly formed in
both underivatized and derivatized samples and was observed in high
abundance after 60 s of heating at 250 °C with a clear time-dependent
trend. Also, this byproduct was identified in the heated underivatized
and derivatized samples at 250 °C for 300 s and there was no
detection in all heated blank samples used as controls. It is unknown
how this byproduct is formed during heating; it is possible that the
oleic acid could react with ethylamine, a breakdown product of other
metabolites. For other unidentified features in heated plasma metabolites,
a very interesting pattern was observed in many targeted MS/MS fragments.
As shown in Figure S-7, a typical neutral
loss of 45.057 mass units and m/z of 72.08 and 90.09 was observed. The m/z of 45.057 and 72.08 could be possibly C2H7N and C4H10N, respectively. One possible
source of those ions was from the breakdown of peptides. Under heated
conditions, peptides can potentially degrade and interfere with the
global metabolomics profiling, which could contribute to the complexity
of the data interpretation.

Conclusion
In
this study the combined effect of heating and chemical derivatization
on the human plasma extracts and a set of small molecule standards
was investigated using global molecular profiling. The results show
that heating had a significant effect on both sets of samples. Alterations
began to be observed on plasma metabolites at 100 °C for 300
s. Most importantly, over 40% of the total features were altered after
heating at 250 °C for 300 s and approximately half of these altered
features were upregulated, suggesting that new compounds are being
formed during the heating process. Furthermore, the protective effect
of derivatization was not found to be significant. To validate these
observations, we examined a standard mixture of 64 small molecules.
The mixture profile was considerably altered, with the majority of
molecules degraded within 60 s of being heated at 250 °C. For
example, tri- and diorganophosphates (i.e., ATP and ADP) readily degraded
to mono-organophosphate (AMP). Nucleotides (i.e., inosine and inosine
monophosphate) were found to transform into purine derivatives (i.e.,
hypoxanthine). Oleoyl ethyl amide was one of the commonly identified
byproducts observed in both the underivatized and derivatized mixtures
after heating, which could be formed via reaction(s) involving oleic
acid.

These results indicate that heating at elevated temperature
(e.g.,
250 °C) significantly alters the molecular profile and even moderate
temperatures can produce significant degradation/transformation. These
alterations are especially consequential in experiments involving
minutes of exposure to elevated temperatures, such as those used in
GC/MS systems, indicating that a significant amount of the spectral
data generated in GC/MS experiments may correspond to thermal degradation
products. These results may also provide an explanation as to why
mass spectral databases (such as NIST) have been computationally challenging
to interpret, as a significant amount of data may be coming from thermal
degradation of the standards.
