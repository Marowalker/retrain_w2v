DNA and RNA biomarkers
have not progressed beyond the automated
specialized clinic due to failure in the reproducibility necessary
to standardize robust and rapid nucleic acid detection at the point
of care, where health outcomes can be most improved by early-stage
diagnosis and precise monitoring of therapy and disease prognosis.
We demonstrate here a new analytical platform to meet this challenge
using functional 3D hydrogels engineered from peptide and oligonucleotide
building blocks to provide sequence-specific, PCR-free fluorescent
detection of unlabeled nucleic acid sequences. We discriminated at
picomolar detection limits (<7 pM) “perfect-match”
from mismatched sequences, down to a single nucleotide mutation, buried
within longer lengths of the target. Detailed characterization by
NMR, TEM, mass spectrometry, and rheology provided the structural
understanding to design these hybrid peptide–oligonucleotide
biomaterials with the desired sequence sensitivity and detection limit.
We discuss the generic design, which is based on a highly predictable
secondary structure of the oligonucleotide components, as a platform
to detect genetic abnormalities and to screen for pathogenic conditions
at the level of both DNA (e.g., SNPs) and RNA (messenger, micro, and
viral genomic RNA).

==== Body
Nucleic acid
sequences (DNA
and RNA) are well recognized as important diagnostic and prognostic
biomarkers for a wide range of pathological conditions in humans.
Identification of single or multiple nucleotide polymorphisms at the
DNA level can be crucial in recognizing patient susceptibility to
most monogenic or complex diseases, such as Bardet–Biedl syndrome,1 diabetes,2 rheumatoid
arthritis,3 Alzheimer’s disease,4 sickle-cell anemia,5 schizophrenia,6 cancer,7,8 multiple sclerosis,9 cystic fibrosis,10 muscular dystrophy,11 and Parkinson’s disease.12 Of
particular diagnostic importance is the detection of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), which are often associated with different types
of human pathophysiology.13−16 Similarly of growing importance is the rapid detection
of overexpressed functional RNAs (e.g. mRNAs or nonprotein-coding
RNAs, including miRNA, siRNA, piRNA, and/or lncRNA), with the advantage
of earlier diagnosis and treatment of various pathological conditions,
including neurodegenerative,17 cardiovascular,18 and autoimmune diseases,19 as well as different types of cancer20 (e.g. lymphoma, leukemia, and pancreatic, lung, and breast
cancer). Technologies to detect specific nucleic acid sequences and
the genetic variations within a human genome are often based on hybridization
bioassays involving the use of DNA microarrays, in which thousands
of probes are immobilized on a 2D surface. Optical,21 electrochemical,22 or gravimetric23 detection is commonly used to monitor hybridization.
Although widely used currently, they are limited to the specialized
automated laboratory and their future commercial success is threatened
by rapid next-generation sequencing.24−27 The high cost of automation of
complex multistep procedures, their inadequate detection limits, which
often require target amplification by PCR, together with poor sensitivity
and, particularly, the lack of reproducibility between devices28−30 render such approaches unsuitable to the growing need for diagnostic
tests at the point of care. Furthermore, such reproducibility is required
in a simple test format suitable for direct interaction with live
biological materials sampled from patients at the point of care.

Here, we demonstrate that oligonucleotide–peptide hydrogels can overcome such limitations. Unlike other polymers,
many peptide hydrogelators form noncovalent 3D assemblies that spontaneously
and reversibly produce hydrogels under physiological conditions, with
excellent compatibility with live biological materials.31−33 Peptide hydrogels also coassemble with modified components and display
attached groups as probes on the surface of the peptide fibers that
entangle to form the hydrogel. Functional groups are evenly spaced
throughout the fibrous structure due to the stochastic nature of self-assembly.34 We find here that the ability to increase spatial
separation between probes on the fiber surface minimizes unwanted probe–probe interactions, which may cause the poor
sensitivity or false positives suffered by 2D microarray and biosensor
devices. Functional hydrogel materials also have greater storage capacity
than 2D systems,35,36 which here improves the detection
limits and sensitivity. Their self-assembling and self-healing nature37,38 allowed our hydrogel detector to be dried and regenerated upon the
addition of water, thereby providing simplicity of use, after long-term
storage, protected against nuclease degradation.35

Materials and Methods
Peptide Synthesis
Lys-Lys-Phe-Glu-Trp-Glu-Phe-Glu-Lys-Lys
(p2(+)), Mal-Gly-Gly-Lys-Lys-Phe-Glu-Trp-Glu-Phe-Glu-Lys-Lys
(Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+)), and Val-Lys-Val-Lys-Val-Glu-Val-Lys
(v(+2)) were synthesized on a
preloaded Fmoc-Lys-Boc-wang resin (300 mg, 0.1 mmol) using SPPS Fmoc
chemistry. N,N-Diisopropylethylamine
(DIPEA, 0.6 mmol, 6 equiv) and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-O-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)uronium
hexafluorophosphate (HBTU, 0.3 mmol, 3 equiv) were used as activating
and coupling agents, respectively. For maleimide-modified peptide
(Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+)), N-maleoyl β-alanine modification was added at the
N-terminus. Peptides were cleaved from the resin using TFA solution
(TFA/TIPS/H2O, 95/2.5/2.5; v/v/v 15 mL), precipitated in
cold diethyl ether for 5 min. The peptides were separated by centrifugation
and freeze-dried for 2 h. Peptides were then purified by reversed-phase
HPLC (ACE 10 Preparative C-8 250 × 21.2 mm, PerkinElmer Nelson
1022, MA US) using 0.1% TFA in distilled water (eluent A) and 0.1%
TFA in acetonitrile (eluent B) with a gradient increasing linearly
from 10 to 100% of eluent B in 55 min at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min
(see Figure S1). Peptides were then characterized
by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Bruker Avance II+ NMR spectrometer,
operating at proton frequencies of 400 MHz). In all cases, spectra
were acquired using a BBI 1H/D-BB Z-GRD Z8202/0347 probe
and processed using Bruker software Topspin v2.0 or v2.1). Mass spectra
of peptides and peptide–oligonucleotide conjugate
were collected on a Waters SQ detector, mass spectrometer, electrospray/APCI
ion source attached to an HPLC system (MA, USA), and matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-ToF/ToF) spectra
were collected on a Bruker Daltonics Ultraflex II mass spectrometer
(MA, USA), respectively. The peptides Mal-Acp-Gly-Gly-Val-Lys-Val-Lys-Val-Glu-Val-Lys
(Mal-Acp-Gly-Gly-v(+2), Acp;
aminocaproic acid linker) and Glu-Glu-Phe-Lys-Trp-Lys-Phe-Lys-Glu-Glu
(p1(−)) were purchased
from Biomatik (Cambridge, Ontario, Canada), and excess trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) was removed via lyophilization from 10% (w/v) aqueous acetic
acid.

Oligonucleotides
The following oligodeoxynucleotides
were used in this study: 5′GGATTAGACTATCTCTGTGTTTGGCGAATGAAGTATCTTG3′ (long perfect match), 5′TCTGTGTTTGGCGA3′ (perfect match), 5′GGATTAGACTCTCTCTGAGTTTGGCGAATGAAGTATCTTG3′ (mutant 1), 5′GGATTAGACTCTCTCTGAGTATGGCGAATGAAGTATCTTG3′ (mutant
2), 5′GGATTAGACTCTCTCTGAGTATGGCAAATGAAGTATCTTG3′ (mutant 3), 5′TTGTGTCTTAGC3′ (scrambled sequence, i.e. complete
mismatch), 5′F-T*CGATTCGCCAAACACAGAATCGA3′-D (MB (terminal FAM), T* represents thiol modification)
and 5′(CH2)6SS-F-T*CGATTCGCCAAACACAGAATCGA-D3′(MB (internal FAM), T* represents (CH2)6SS modification). Oligodeoxynucleotides (see Table S1 and Figure S2 for sequences
and representative structures, respectively) were purchased from ATDBio
Ltd. (Southampton, U.K.). Prior to hybridization, oligonucleotides
were desalted by gel filtration using GE Healthcare NAP-25 columns
(Fisher Scientific UK Ltd., Loughborough, U.K.) using the protocol
described in the manual.

Hydrogel Characterization
For negative
staining transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), hydrogel samples were formed from 20 mM
(27 mg mL–1) p1(−) and p2(+) peptides with
and without oligonucleotide–peptide conjugate at pH 7.2 and
incubated at 20 °C for 24 h. Samples were then diluted 1000-fold
in doubly distilled water and placed onto glow-discharge treated 400
mesh carbon coated grids (Agar Scientific, Stansted, U.K.) for 1 min,
washed three times with doubly distilled water, and negatively stained
with freshly prepared and filtered 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate (Agar Scientific,
Stansted, U.K.) for 1 min, blotting at each stage using Whatman filter
paper. Samples were viewed and recorded on a Tecnai Biotwin TEM instrument
(FEI, Oregon, USA) under an accelerating voltage of 100 kV, and imaged
with a GATAN Orius CCD (Gatan, Oxford, U.K.). Fiber width and morphology
analysis were performed using ImageJ. Rheological measurements of
hydrogels were performed on a stress-controlled rheometer (Discovery
HR-2, TA Instruments, Hertz, U.K.) using a 20 mm parallel plate. Samples
were prepared by mixing equimolar concentrations (20 mM) of peptides p1(−) and p2(+) and incubated at 20 °C for 24 h prior
to measurement. Hydrogel samples (180 μL) were loaded onto the
stage, with the gap between the upper plate and stage set at 500 μm.
Amplitude sweeps were undertaken at an oscillation frequency of 1
Hz between 0.02 and 40% strain. G′ and G″ moduli were estimated in frequency sweeps between
0.01 and 15 Hz, at 0.2% strain.

Conjugate Synthesis
The peptide–oligonucleotide
conjugates were synthesized as described by the reaction route in Figure S3 using a thiol–maleimide coupling
reaction. Thiol-modified oligonucleotides with disulfide protecting
groups were purchased from ATDbio Ltd. to prevent unwanted interference
during synthesis, as well as the spontaneous formation of disulfide
bonds. Prior to conjugation of the Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+) to the thiol-modified oligonucleotide 5′F-T*CGATTCGCCAAACACAGAATCGA-D3′(where T* is internal fluorescein and terminal thiol-functionalized
thymidine nucleotide), the disulfide protecting group was reduced
using a 10-fold excess of tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) in
100 mM phosphate-buffered saline at pH 3 for 4 h, at room temperature.
The maleimide-modified peptide, Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+) (1.6 mg, 1 μmol), was dissolved in a minimal
volume of DMSO (30 μL) and added to the oligonucleotide (0.04
μmol) in 70 μL of phosphate-buffered saline with gentle
agitation. Conjugation of the thiol to maleimide proceeded spontaneously
in aqueous media, adjusted to pH 7.0 with 0.5 M NaOH. DMSO (30% v/v)
was included to disrupt fiber formation and minimize self-assembly.
Reaction with a 25-fold excess of Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+) for 4 h at room temperature gave the desired
product (in 71% yield by HPLC, Figure S3B). The reaction was upscaled by increasing the component concentrations
stochiometrically.

Crude materials were purified by reversed-phase
HPLC using a Phenomenex Luna C-18 column. Eluents used included (A)
0.05 M LiClO4 in water and (B) 0.05 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile, typically in a gradient from 0% to 50% of eluent
B over 60 min. Oligonucleotide fractions were identified by detection
of the UV absorbance at 260 nm and through their retention times (Figure S4). The collected fractions containing
peptide–oligonucleotide conjugates were lyophilized. The lyophilizate
was dissolved in D2O and relyophilized prior to 1H NMR characterization (Bruker Avance II+, 400 MHz). In all cases,
oligonucleotide concentrations were measured using the UV absorbance
at 260 nm (Varian Cary 4000 dual beam UV–vis spectrophotometer,
Australia) using millimolar extinction coefficients as shown in Table S1. The conjugates were also characterized
by mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF/ToF) using a Bruker Daltonics Ultraflex-II
instrument (MA, USA).

Sample Preparation
All samples for
hybridization assays
were prepared in aqueous 100 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.2) containing 200
mM KCl. Final peptide concentrations of 20 mM were used for hydrogel
samples, unless stated otherwise. These were prepared by dissolving
the peptide in half the total volume of water, followed by addition
of the above hybridization buffer. After addition of the peptide–oligonucleotide
conjugate, the pH was immediately adjusted to 7.2 with 5 M NaOH. The
consequent reduction of buffer concentration in hydrogels by half
(50 mM Tris pH 7.2, 100 mM KCl) did not affect hybridization and the
resulting fluorescent signal, in comparison to solution studies.

Hybridization Studies
Following overnight incubation
at 20 °C, oligonucleotide hybridization was assessed by increase
in fluorescence at 519 nm (λex 494 nm) at 20 °C
(or 37 °C where stated) either in (a) 1 cm path-length quartz
cuvettes, using a Shimadzu RF-5301 spectrofluorophotometer, operated
with RF-5310PC software (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) and equipped
with temperature-controlled cell holder and 150 W xenon lamp, or (b)
in microwell plates, using a Tecan Safire plate reader operated under
Magellan Data Analysis Software (V.7).

Limit of Detection
The limit of detection (LoD) was
estimated using a Tecan Safire plate reader in accordance with an
established protocol.39 Hybridization was
detected over a 10 pM to 200 nM concentration range for the peptide–oligonucleotide
conjugates and targets. Hydrogel molecular detectors with MB-Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+) conjugate doping levels ranging
from 2.0 × 10–3 to 1.06 × 10–7 % were deposited in 250 μL aliquots into 96-well plates. Analyte
samples (10 μL) containing the “perfect-match”
(PM) DNA target were then introduced into the hydrogel molecular detector
to achieve the same final molar concentration as the concentration
of the recognition probe in each well. Following incubation for over
24 h at 20 °C, fluorescence measurements were taken. For comparison,
similar studies were carried out in a solution containing 100 mM Tris
and 200 mM KCl. Measurements were replicated as 20 freshly prepared
samples with an equal amount of target analyte and molecular probe
incorporated into the hydrogel and 20 blanks containing only the peptide
hydrogel molecular detector with 10 μL buffer introduced on
top. The mean value for “blank” samples (Meanblank, n = 20) and standard deviations of the blank (SDblank), as well as those of the low-concentration (10 pM) sample
(SDlcs, n = 20), were estimated from eqs 1 and 2, as presented in the Results and Discussion). Fluorescence was recorded at λem 523 nm following
excitation at 494 nm.

Results and Discussion
Our hydrogel
molecular detector required precise integration of
biorecognition into the controlled self-assembly of the peptide fibers
of the hydrogel, in order to achieve direct detection of unmodified,
biologically relevant nucleic acid sequences, without any amplification.
To achieve this, we used here a molecular beacon (MB) concept (Figure 1), employing here
fluorescein (as fluorophore, F) and dabcyl (as quencher, D). Binding of a complementary unlabeled target generated
a fluorescent signal, due to the spatial separation of the fluorescein–dabcyl FRET pair, triggered by hybridization
to the loop and/or the fragment of the stem region of the MB recognition
element. The FRET pair was covalently attached to respective terminal
groups of the recognition oligonucleotide (with F and D located at the 5′-end and 3′-end, respectively).
A third attachment point was used to conjugate the MB recognition
element to the peptide modification decorating the peptide hydrogel
fibers.

Figure 1 Design of a hydrogel incorporating oligonucleotide molecular probes
bearing a recognition element and a sensing detector for sequence-specific
detection of nucleic acids. Left: the nondecorated peptide hydrogel.
middle: the nonhybridized peptide–oligonucleotide probes labeled
with the fluorophore (F, in red) and quencher (Q, in black) are integrated into a hydrogel biomaterial in
the form of folded structures (molecular beacons), which remain fluorescently
silent due to effective quenching of F by closely located Q. Right: the decorated hydrogel incorporating peptide–oligonucleotide molecular probes allows capture of the biotarget (DNA or RNA) by
Watson–Crick hydrogen bonding between regions complementary
to the oligonucleotide recognition motifs, which triggers probe unfolding
and separation of the F and Q to allow F to fluoresce.

Peptide hydrogels formed by the amphipathic peptide Val-Lys-Val-Lys-Val-Glu-Val-Lys
(v(+2)- peptide)
did not provide suitable fluorescence signals upon hybridization with
the target sequence. The MB-peptide conjugate MB-Mal-Acp-Gly-Gly-v(+2) formed a seven-residue staple
region (i.e., F-5′T*CGATTCGCCAAACACAGAATCGA3′-D, where the nucleotides that formed the stem region are underlined).
The detailed chemical structure of such a MB-Mal-Acp-Gly-Gly-v(+2) conjugate is shown in Figure S2A. The base denoted with an asterisk
was a thymidine with a modified aromatic base that allowed attachment
of a thiol group via a flexible linker at position 5 (see Figure 2A and Figure S2A). Synthesis of the peptide–oligonucleotide
conjugate MB-Mal-Acp-Gly-Gly-v(+2) was achieved using thiol–maleimide chemistry between the
thiol-modified MB and N-terminally modified v(+2)-peptide (see Figure S3A for chemistry). The successful syntheses of the Mal-Acp-Gly-Gly-v(+2) peptide and MB-Mal-Acp-Gly-Gly-v(+2) conjugate were confirmed using
reversed-phase HPLC, mass spectrometry (see Figure S11B), and 1H NMR spectroscopy (see Figures S12B and S13B and Materials
and Methods for details).

Figure 2 Attachment of peptide component and fluorophore
to the MB probe.
(A) The peptide–MB conjugate was synthesized by linking the
internal thiol-dT nucleotide to the maleimide functional group attached
at the N-terminus of the amphiphatic v(+2) peptide (Mal-Acp-Gly-Gly-v(+2)). In this case, fluorophore (F) was attached
at the 5′-terminus of the oligonucleotide. (B) The peptidyl–MB
conjugate was synthesized from the oligonucleotide labeled with an
internal fluorophore (F) and bearing the 5′-terminal
thiol group, which was conjugated to the ionic peptide (Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+)) via an N-maleoyl-β-alanine
functional group. In both cases, the quencher (dabcyl) was attached
at the 3′-terminus of MB. The oligonucleotide is color-coded
to show the loop (purple) and stem region (green) of the MB. The peptide
is shown in blue. Fluorescein and dabcyl are denoted as F and D and shown as red and black spheres, respectively.
The peptide was attached using thiol-–aleimide chemistry between
a thiol-functionalized nucleotide, denoted with an asterisk, and a
maleimide-functionalized self-assembling peptide.

Hydrogels formed by v(+2)-peptide
in both the absence and presence of the MB-Mal-Acp-Gly-Gly-v(+2) conjugate (0.006% doping level) were
characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Figure S14). Inefficient quenching of the fluorophore
by the quencher in the unhybridized state of the MB-Mal-Acp-Gly-Gly-v(+2) conjugate appeared to give a
higher background signal of the unbound probe and poor overall fluorescence
response upon its hybridization with the target sequence (typically
only 10-fold fluorescence increase above the background, data not
shown). Moreover, the uncontrolled gelation of the amphipathic peptide v(+2) during its conjugation to the
MB and the extremely low reaction yield (only 7%) in the synthesis
of the MB-Mal-Acp-Gly-Gly-v(+2) conjugate made this design unsuitable for practical use. This was
resolved by precise control of the gelation of the peptide component
using the complementary ionic peptides41p1(−) (Glu-Glu-Phe-Lys-Trp-Lys-Phe-Lys-Glu-Glu)
and p2(+) (Lys-Lys-Phe-Glu-Trp-Glu-Phe-Glu-Lys-Lys).
These ionic peptides provided an alternating pattern of hydrophobic
(e.g. Phe and Trp) and hydrophilic (e.g., Lys and Glu) amino acids,
such that the peptides were flanked with oppositely charged residues.
Here, p1(−) presented
the negatively charged [Glu-Glu] blocks at both the N- and C-termini,
whereas the p2(+) peptide was
flanked with positively charged [Lys-Lys] blocks from both ends of
the sequence. The absence of homotypic interactions prompt the “sticky
faces” of p1(−) and p2(+) to self-assemble
into antiparallel β-sheets capable of forming fibrils.41 Peptide p1(−) carried a net negative charge of −1 due to the predominance
of Glu residues over Lys residues, whereas p2(+) was positively charged +1, as more Lys residues
than Glu residues were in its structure.

The MB-Mal-Acp-Gly-Gly-v(+2) conjugate incorporated the thiol
group internally into the recognition
oligonucleotide (“internal-thiol”), which led to a low
(7%) conjugate yield (see Figures S3A and S4 in the Supporting Information), as this functional group was presumably
buried within the structure and less accessible for reaction with
the peptide. When, however, we swapped the attachment point of the
peptide with that of the fluorophore, in such a way that the thiol
linker (−(CH2)6-SH) became located at
the 5′-terminal position of the MB probe (“terminal-thiol”,
see Figure 2B for the
design and Figure S2B for structural details),
we considerably (>10-fold) improved the final reaction yield (71%).
In addition, the closer location of the fluorophore and quencher in
this design allowed a reduced background noise for the unhybridized
MB, thereby contributing to the improved sensitivity and LoD reported
below.

Favorable conditions for efficient conjugation with MB
were provided
by selection of the p2(+) peptide
for conjugation, because it has a relatively high critical gelation
concentration in comparison to that of p1(−) (i.e., 35 and 65 mM for p1(−) and p2(+), respectively;
see Table S2 in the Supporting Information).
The peptide was functionalized with a maleimide moiety to produce
Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+) for conjugation
with the MB probe. A two-glycine spacer was added to the peptide sequence
to provide a flexible linker between the peptide fibers and the DNA
recognition motif, in order to avoid agglomeration of biomolecules
at the N-terminus following conjugate synthesis. Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+) was synthesized using standard
Fmoc-based solid-phase synthesis and functionalized with N-maleoyl-β-alanine at the N-terminus, as we described previously.35 Synthesis of the peptide–oligonucleotide conjugate MB-Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+) was performed using a thiol–maleimide chemistry (see Materials and Methods) between the thiol-modified
MB and N-terminally labeled peptide Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+) (see Figure 2 and Figure S3B for the
design and synthetic route, respectively). Successful conjugation
of the Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+) to the
oligonucleotide was confirmed (i) by the change in the HPLC retention
time from 22.9 min (thiol–oligonucleotide) to 24.5 min (conjugate)
(see Figure S4), (ii) by mass spectrometry
of the purified product (see Table S1 and Figure S10), (iii) by the disappearance of the 1H NMR signal
at 6.78 ppm, which was previously observed for the maleimide CH=CH
protons, and (iv) by comparison of the 1H NMR recorded
for the reaction product with those of the starting materials (Figures S9A,B).

Hydrogel Characterization
The hydrogel was prepared
by mixing equimolar concentrations (20 mM) of unfunctionalized p1(−) and p2(+) at pH 5, followed by adjustment to pH 7.2,
which triggered formation of a solid self-supporting hydrogel within
1 min at room temperature. TEM of the peptidyl–-oligonucleotide
hydrogel showed that the peptide fiber morphology was not affected
by the incorporation of the peptide–oligonucleotide conjugate,
MB-Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+) (see Figure 3), at the highest
doping level used here (0.0025% relative to the base peptides). Peptide
fibers in the naked and decorated hydrogels had average diameters
of 4.7 and 4.5 nm, respectively (4.7 nm, SD = 1.2, SE = 0.08, n = 224; 4.5 nm, SD = 1.1, SE = 0.065, n = 326, see Figure 3B,C). Microscopic analysis revealed twisted helical structures and
defined spiraling of peptide fibers along the axes. This twisting
pattern of fibers can be attributed to the chiral folding of peptide
chains, persumbly caused by the strength of specific interactions
between the complementary peptide components. For comparison, the
amphipathic peptide v(+2), with
and without the addition of peptide–oligonucleotide conjugate,
MB-Mal-Acp-Gly-Gly-v(+2) (0.006%
relative to the base peptide), showed thicker fibers with slightly
larger average diameters of 5.27 and 5.34 nm, respectively (SD = 0.54, n = 50; SD = 0.68, n = 50; Figure S14).

into the hydrogel (average dimeter 4.5 nm, SD = 1.1, n = 326). The hydrogel sample was prepared from 10 mg mL–1 of peptides at pH 7.2. Hydrogel carries a neutral charge under molecular
sensing working conditions. (D) Amplitude sweep of a standard hydrogel
sample prepared from 20 mM concentrations of peptides (p1(−)+ p2(+)). Storage (G′) and loss (G″) moduli showed their independence at 1% strain. (E) Frequency
sweeps of peptide hydrogel samples with and without the addition of
the highest concentration (0.5 μM, 0.01% relative to base peptides)
of the recognition probe used in this study, at 1% strain from 0.01
to 15 Hz. Average data of three independent experiments are presented.

Mechanical characterization of
the peptide hydrogel formed by p1(−) (Glu-Glu-Phe-Lys-Trp-Lys-Phe-Lys-Glu-Glu)
and p2(+) (Lys-Lys-Phe-Glu-Trp-Glu-Phe-Glu-Lys-Lys)
peptides was carried out by oscillatory shear rheometry, in both amplitude
and frequency-sweep modes to determine the storage (G′) and loss moduli (G″). The linear
viscoelastic region (LVR), quantized for hydrogel in amplitude-sweep
mode, showed the moduli independence at 1% strain (see Figure 3D), which was chosen for frequency-sweep
studies. No significant difference in hydrogel mechanical strength
was observed with and without the addition of the highest concentration
of the recognition probe used in this study (0.0025% relative to the
base peptides), suggesting that incorporation of the recognition element
did not interfere with the bulk physical properties of the peptide
hydrogel (Figure 3E),
although the possibility of some local changes in the peptide fiber
architecture cannot be excluded.

Hybridization Studies
The “perfect-match”
(PM) target for the designed probe was optimized by ensuring that
its sequence (5′TCTGTGTTTGGCGA3‘) is complementary primarily to the loop region of the MB probe.
Prior to hybridization with the “perfect-match” analyte
sequence 5′TCTGTGTTTGGCGA3′, unconjugated MB and MB–Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+) conjugate were almost completely fluorescently silent
in isolation (Figure 4). The hydrogel environment provided more effective quenching of
the fluorophore by the quencher in comparison to that seen in solution
(1.9-fold lower for MB and 2.7-fold for MB–peptide conjugate, Figure 4A,B). Upon exposure
to perfect match DNA (5′TCTGTGTTTGGCGA3′), this low fluorescence background allowed the large,
more than 2 orders of magnitude increase in fluorescence (106-fold
for incorporated MB and 166-fold for immobilized MB-Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+), Figure 4A,B). The hydrogel environment amplified
the fluoresence signal by considerably improving the signal to noise
(S/N) ratio. In addition to the
reduced background, the fluorescence intensity of the reporter group
may also be improved within the hydrogel environment, by aligning
the quencher (Q) and fluorophore (F) at
a comparably greater distance after hybridization events. The positively
charged surfaces of hydrogel fibers may also attract the negatively
charged analyte DNA and increase their “effective” concentrations
around the recognition probe, thereby leading to more efficient hybridization.

(A) solution and (B) hydrogel. (A) The peptide–oligonucleotide
conjugate MB–Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+) (magenta) and MB (green) were fluorescently silent in isolation
(i.e. prior to addition of the analyte sequence). The addition of
the “perfect-match” target (PM) led to hybridization
with the recognition motif of the probe, which triggered fluorescence
from MB–Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+) (black) or MB (red). All components were at 0.5 μM concentration.
Hydrogel was prepared at pH 7.2 using 20 mM of base peptides (p1(−)+p2(+)). Fluorescence was recorded at λem 519 nm following excitation at λex 494 nm. Inserts

signal from free MB and conjugate MB–Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+).

“Fishing” for Sequence Fragments
The hydrogel molecular detector could “fish out” and detect a “perfect-match” target (14 nt) when it
was embedded in the central part of a longer (40 nt) oligonucleotide
sequence 5′GGATTAGACTATCTCTGTGTTTGGCGAATGAAGTATCTTG3′, where the “perfect-match” target sequence
is shown in bold italics (Figure 5). In the hydrogel environment at 20 °C (Figure 5B), the addition
of this long “perfect-match” sequence led to a large
enhancement of the fluorescence signal (265-fold), which was even
more pronounced than that seen after introducing the short (14 nt)
fully matched target. Interestingly, the hybridization of the long
“perfect-match” sequence in solution showed a comparatively
modest (25-fold) fluorescence increase under similar conditions (cf. Figure 5A vs Figure 5C). Multiple, weak structural
interactions within the long DNA sequences (e.g. due to imperfect intra- and/or intermolecular Watson–Crick
hydrogen bonding) can be stabilized in aqueous solution, thus representing
significant barriers for hybridization with the MB recognition motifs.
The hydrogel environment seemed to minimize the probability of forming
such structural elements, which led to a better accessibility of the
target regions for recognition by the MB and precise hybridization.
In addition, the conformational constraints induced in the duplex
formed with a longer target following the hybridization events are
likely to be more pronounced in the hydrogel environment than those
in the free solution, which would lead to better spatial separation
of the reporter groups (F and Q) from each
other, thereby contributing to a significant enhancement of the fluorescent
signal.

Figure 5 Comparison of fluorescence detection of hybridization between the
recognition motif with the long “perfect-match” sequence
and with the mismatches in solution (A and C) and in peptide-hydrogel
(B and D) at 20 °C (A and B) and at 37 °C (C and D) for
peptides (p1(−) + p2(+)) at pH 7.2. For comparison,
the response triggered by the addition of the short “perfect-match”
from Figure 4 is shown
(black dotted lines). The peptide–oligonucleotide conjugate
MB–Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+) alone
(magenta) was fluorescently silent prior to addition of the analyte
sequence. The level of fluorescence response strongly depended on
the nature of the analyte sequences: the long “perfect-match”
(Long PM target, blue), mutant 1 (orange), mutant 2 (deep red), mutant
3 (green), and scrambled sequence (yellow). Fluoresence was recorded
at λem 519 nm following excitation at λex 494 nm.

Ability To Discriminate
Mismatches
Finally, we evaluated
whether the designed peptide–hydrogel molecular detector can
be used to discriminate “perfect-match” sequences, particularly
single-nucleotide mutations, as SNPs are linked to various monogenic
and complex diseases.13−16 The long “perfect-match” analyte sequence 5′GGATTAGACTATCTCTGTGTTTGGCGAATGAAGTATCTTG3′ was “mutated”
at one, two, or three different positions to produce three “mutant”
sequences. Mutant 1 (5′GGATTAGACTCTCTCTGAGTTTGGCGAATGAAGTATCTTG3′) had A (underlined) as a replacement for T at position 18. In the sequence of mutant 2 (5′GGATTAGACTCTCTCTGAGTATGGCGAATGAAGTATCTTG3′) two thymidine residues at positions 18 and 21 were
replaced with adenosine residues, whereas mutant 3 (5′GGATTAGACTCTCTCTGAGTATGGCAAATGAAGTATCTTG3′) had an additional
third mutation by replacement of G at
position 26 with A (see Table S1 for a full list of sequences). A negative
control was compared, using a scrambled sequence (5′TTGTGTCTTAGC3‘), which had no complementarity
with the MB recognition motif. Each analyte sequence was added to
a peptide–hydrogel molecular detector preloaded with MB-Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+) conjugate in separate incubates,
as described earlier for the long “perfect-match” target.
Similar studies were carried out in free solution to compare the performance
with the hydrogel environment (see Materials and
Methods for full details). Gratifyingly, very little difference
was observed between the background fluorescence of the MB-Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+) conjugate and the fluorescent
signal developed after addition of mutant 2, or mutant 3, or the “scrambled”
sequence, both in solution and hydrogel (Figure 5A,B). Smaller increases in fluorescence were
observed for mutant 1, both in solution (5-fold) and hydrogel (78-fold),
at 20 °C, presumably indicating a weak hybridization of the mismatched
target with the recognition probe (Figure 5A,B). However, an increase in temperature
from 20 to 37 °C allowed us to minimize the probability of hybridization
through “nonperfect” interactions and to discriminate
a single mismatch (e.g., mutant 1) from the “perfect-match”
sequence. Indeed, at 37 °C the fluorescence response upon hybridization
with mutant 1 was 10.6-fold and 14.5-fold lower in the solution and
hydrogel, respectively, in comparison with the signal generated by
the long “perfect-match” target under identical conditions
(see Figure 5C,D).
Under stringent conditions (e.g., temperature raised to 37 °C),
the designed molecular detector could discriminate SNPs related to
various pathological disorders.

To demonstrate the potential
of our molecular sensor to “fish out” the perfect match sequence from complex analytical samples, we used
an “oligo mix” system to mimic a multimacromolecular
environment containing several RNA and DNA sequences alongside the
isolated PM targets. Either PM target or long PM target was incorporated
into the “oligo mix” sample consisting of various DNA/RNA
components at equimolar concentrations (0.5 mM): miR-21 RNA target
(5‘UAGCUUAUCAGACUGAUGUUGA3‘), miR-21 mismatch 1 (5‘UAGCUAAUCAGACUGAUGUUGA3‘), miR-21 mismatch 2 (5‘UAGCUAAUCAGACUGGUGUUGA3‘), miR-21 mismatch 3 (5‘UUGCUUAUCAGACUGAUGUUGA3), miR-21 mismatch 4 (5‘UAGCUUAUCAGACUGAUGUUCA3‘), and scrambled sequence
(5‘TTGTGTCTTAGC3‘). Such
an “oligo mix” containing either PM target or long PM
target was then added to the test sample preloaded with the MB-Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+) conjugate (Figure S15) either in solution (Figure S15A) or in hydrogel format (Figure S15B) and tested under conditions identical with those described earlier.
The fluoresence signal generated from the “oligo mix”
containing “perfect match” sequences (either PM target
or long PM target) completely replicated the fluorescence response
observed upon addition of the isolated short (14 nt) or longer (40
nt) “perfect match” targets (Figure S15). This demonstrated the ability of our molecular detector
to recognize and detect the target squence in the presence of other
macromolecular components.

Limit of Detection (LoD)
The lowest
limit at which
peptide–hydrogel molecular detection could be reliably measured
was determined through a series of hybridization experiments conducted
with MB–Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+) conjugate and analyte (1:1), over a concentration range of 200 nM
to 10 pM, which corresponded to hydrogel doping levels of 2.0 ×
10–3 to 1.06 × 10–7%. The
lowest concentration of target that was visually distinguishable from
the background using the peptide–hydrogel molecular sensor
was 10 pM (Figure S16). The limit of the
blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) for solution and hydrogel
molecular detector were estimated (see Materials
and Methods for details) by applying eqs 1 and 2: 1   2  The calculated LoB was 4.7
pM, and the LoD
of 6.8 pM was 21-fold lower than that estimated for the MB–Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+) conjugate in solution (LoD =
142 pM). Moreover, the LoD of this biologically relevant hydrogel
molecular detector was notably lower than that estimated for our earlier
design (22 pM), which was built using the amphipathic base peptide v(+2).35 The amphipathic peptide v(+2) formed the hydrogel with slightly thicker nanofibers in comparison
to the ionic complementary peptides (p1(−) and p2(+)). This may have resulted in the formation of a more constrained and
dense fiber architecture by the amphipathic peptide v(+2), which may have led to the reduced mobility
of macromolecules (e.g., DNA probes or DNA targets) on diffusion through
the hydrogel channels, thus hindering the molecular interactions and
performance of molecular detection in the amphipathic peptide hydrogel.

In contrast, the mutual orientation of the key structural components
within the MB detector (i.e., fluorophore, quencher, and peptide)
was the most important factor underpinning the success of the molecular
detector in the ionic peptide hydrogel. Indeed, the refined mutual
location of all the key players of the molecular detector (i.e., F, Q, and peptide) presumably improved fluorophore
quenching within the unhybridized probes, thus leading to a decreased
background signal and improved overall performance upon hybridization
with the target. The higher detection signal (S/N 238:1) in comparison to that in solution (S/N 25:1) was largely attributable to a reduction
in the background fluorescence signal, leading to the observed increase
in the S/N ratio. Further, the ionic
peptide hydrogel environment also seemed to optimize the alignment
of the MB-Mal-Gly-Gly-p2(+) probe
on hybridizing with the target sequence, in such a way as to minimize
residual FRET between F and Q, thus leading
to the enhancement of the fluorescence signal after binding with the
target.

Conclusion
We have demonstrated
here the key structural aspects important
for peptide hydrogel molecular detection of targeted nucleic acids
to be effective at low levels with high specificity. Our hybrid oligonucleotide–peptide hydrogel detector was able
to “fish out” the perfect match target
sequences even from complex analytical sample in the presence of other
RNA and DNA sequences. It discriminated a “perfect-match”
target from mismatched sequences down to a single nucleotide mutation,
even when this mutation was embedded in a longer oligonucleotide sequence,
thus demonstrating its potential to detect SNPs. Optimized assay stringency
conditions provided a simple “on/off” signal for particular single-nucleotide mutations. The simplicity
and robustness of this hydrogel detector appear well suited to evaluation
next in live biological materials.

The modular nature of our
hydrogel molecular detector design can
be readily adapted to other molecular targets simply by changing the
molecular recognition element of the MB–conjugate to the desired
aptamer for the detection and quantification of pathogenic DNA or
microRNA sequences. This molecular design is also suited to different
combinations of fluorophore–quencher FRET
couples or various excimer and exciplex partners to provide an opportunity
for the simultaneous detection of multiple analyte sequences.
