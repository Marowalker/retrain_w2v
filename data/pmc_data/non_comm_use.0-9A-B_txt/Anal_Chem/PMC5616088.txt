Ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS)
can provide orthogonal information,
i.e., m/z and collision cross section
(CCS), for the identification of drugs and drug metabolites. However,
only a small number of CCS values are available for drugs, which limits
the use of CCS as an identification parameter and the assessment of
structure–function relationships of drugs using IM-MS. Here,
we report the development of a rapid workflow for the measurement
of CCS values of a large number of drug or drug-like molecules in
nitrogen on the widely available traveling wave IM-MS (TWIM-MS) platform.
Using a combination of small molecule and polypeptide CCS calibrants,
we successfully determined the nitrogen CCS values of 1425 drug or
drug-like molecules in the MicroSource Discovery Systems’ Spectrum
Collection using flow injection analysis of 384-well plates. Software
was developed to streamline data extraction, processing, and calibration.
We found that the overall drug collection covers a wide CCS range
for the same mass, suggesting a large structural diversity of these
drugs. However, individual drug classes appear to occupy a narrow
and unique space in the CCS–mass 2D spectrum, suggesting a
tight structure–function relationship for each class of drugs
with a specific target. We observed bimodal distributions for several
antibiotic species due to multiple protomers, including the known
fluoroquinolone protomers and the new finding of cephalosporin protomers.
Lastly, we demonstrated the utility of the high-throughput method
and drug CCS database by quickly and confidently confirming the active
component in a pharmaceutical product.

Analytical
techniques are critical
for the pharmaceutical industry, both for the characterization of
a drug and its formulation and for the elucidation of drug metabolism
and disposition mechanisms. Currently, liquid chromatography (LC)
coupled with UV/vis or mass spectrometry (MS) is the predominant technique
used by the European and United States Pharmacopeia to characterize
drug products.1,2 However, these techniques provide
limited structural information on the drugs and have difficulty in
resolving isobaric structural isomers if they cannot be resolved in
the LC dimension. Nuclear magnetic resonance can provide detailed
structural information, but it is particularly low throughput and
requires large amounts of material. Orthogonal and high-throughput
analysis is needed for rapid and confident identification of drug
molecules from pharmaceutical formulations, biological matrixes, or
counterfeits and for the study of drug metabolism and disposition.

Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) is a rapid gas-phase separation
technology based on the mobility of analyte ions in a neutral buffer
gas3−7 and is orthogonal to conventional chromatographic separations that
are mostly based on the differences in analyte polarity. The mobility
of the ions is determined by the rotationally averaged projected area
of the ion-neutral pair, or its collision-cross section (CCS) with
the neutral gas, which in turn determines the drift time (td) of the ions through the gas-buffered region.
When ion mobility (IM) is coupled with MS (IM-MS), a two-dimensional
(2D) separation is achieved on the basis of the structure (as indicated
by CCS) and mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). The CCS of an ion depends on its gas-phase packing efficiency.
It has been found that different classes of biological molecules tend
to occupy a narrow space in the CCS–mass 2D spectrum.7,8 Specifically, for the same mass, CCS values (or td) tend to increase in the order of oligonucleotides,
carbohydrates, peptides, and lipids, which suggests that their gas-phase
packing efficiencies decrease in the same order.7,8 Moreover,
even subclasses of each group of molecules, such as those of lipids,
can be differentiated based on their location in the 2D spectrum.8−12 Thus, IM-MS could be used to approximately classify an unknown ion
based on its location in the CCS–mass 2D spectrum.

IMS
has been commonly used to detect small organic molecules such
as explosives and drugs in forensic and security applications, e.g.,
in airport security and international efforts against counterfeit
drugs.13−15 In recent years, IM-MS has shown advantages in structurally
characterizing drugs and their metabolites.16−21 For example, IM-MS was able to differentiate the diastereomers betamethasone
and dexamethasone even though their CCS values differ by only 1 Å2.17 More recently, sites of glucuronidation
of drugs were differentiated using IM-MS in combination with molecular
modeling and theoretical CCS calculations.19,21 However, previous studies on drugs are all on a small scale, from
a few to a few tens of compounds, which prevents the assembly of a
useful CCS database for their identification and the assessment of
the structure–function relationships using IM-MS.

CCS
values can be directly measured using drift tube-ion mobility
(DTIM) instruments following the Mason–Schamp equation.22 To obtain accurate CCS values, a series of measurements
are normally needed while ramping the drift voltage from low to high,8,23 although a single field-strength measurement can be achieved with
an estimated time outside the mobility cell (t0) through calibration. On the other hand, CCS measurements
on traveling wave-ion mobility (TWIM) instruments require calibration
of the relationship between CCS and td using a series of calibrants with known CCS values.23−26 Although this strategy is an indirect way of obtaining CCS, it has
the advantage of higher throughput because only one measurement is
needed for each technical replicate. On the basis of previous studies
by others and us, calibrants with similar physical properties to the
analytes would result in the highest accuracy in CCS values in TWIM
analysis.24,26,27

In order
to cover the mass range of commonly used drugs (from m/z 100 to 1500), we chose a series of
drugs, drug-like molecules, and poly-dl-alanines (PolyAla)
as calibrants for the measurement of drug CCSs. The CCS values of
these calibrants were measured on a DTIM instrument with nitrogen
as the drift gas. Using these calibrants, we sought to measure the
nitrogen CCS values of 2000 compounds in the MicroSource Discovery
Systems’ Spectrum Collection that contains 50% known drugs,
30% natural products, and 20% other bioactive components. We successfully
determined the CCS values of 1425 of these compounds using flow injection
analysis of 384-well plates. Software was developed to streamline
data extraction, processing, and calibration. We found that the overall
drug collection covers a wide CCS range for the same masses, suggesting
a large structural diversity of the drugs. However, individual drug
classes appear to occupy a narrow and unique space in the CCS–mass
2D spectrum, suggesting a tight structure–function relationship
for each class of drugs.

Experimental Section
Materials
PolyAla,
acetaminophen, and betaine hydrochloride
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The following compounds with purities
≥98% were ordered from Cayman Chemical: alprenolol hydrochloride,
clozapine N-oxide, erythromycin, ondansetron hydrochloride,
reserpine, vancomycin hydrochloride, and verapamil hydrochloride.
A peptide with the sequence Ac-ETDYYRKG-NH2 (peptide
K-8; catalog no. BP12-202) was purchased from New England Peptide,
Inc. PolyAla was prepared at 100 μg/mL in 95% acetonitrile/5%
water (Optima LC-MS, Fisher Scientific) with 0.1% formic acid (Sigma-Aldrich).
A mixture of drug and drug-like compounds containing alprenolol (2
μM), clozapine N-oxide (2 μM), ondansetron
(2 μM), reserpine (2 μM), verapamil (2 μM), Peptide
K-8 (5 μM), betaine (10 μM), acetaminophen (10 μM),
erythromycin (10 μM), and vancomycin (10 μM) was prepared
in 1:1 acetonitrile/water with 0.1% formic acid. The MicroSource Discovery
Systems, Inc. (MDSI) Spectrum Collection was purchased from the Quellos
High Throughput Screening Core at the University of Washington. The
collection of 2000 compounds (purity ≥95%) was plated into
384-well plates at 10 μM in acetonitrile and sealed with manually
slit silicone mats (Axygen). A 300 mg capsule of clindamycin was purchased
from Watson Pharmaceuticals (now Teva Pharmaceuticals). The contents
of the capsule (approximately 600 mg total) was used to prepare a
1 mg/mL solution in 1:1 acetonitrile/water with 0.1% formic acid,
which was diluted further to 1 ng/mL.

DTIM CCS Measurements
Erythromycin, peptide K-8 Ac-ETDYYRKG-NH2, and
vancomycin were dissolved to 5 μM in 1:1 acetonitrile/water
with 0.1% formic acid. Nitrogen DTIM CCS measurements of the drug
standards and PolyAla (n = 2–21) were performed
in positive mode using a modified Waters Synapt G2 HDMS (Wilmslow,
United Kingdom) containing a radio frequency (RF) confining drift
cell in place of the previous traveling wave cell.28 Measurements were performed using methods reported previously
with nitrogen drift gas.28 Mobilities of
ions measured using the RF-confining drift cell are indistinguishable
from those using an electrostatic drift tube.24,28,29 The arrival-time distribution (ATD) for
each ion was extracted and analyzed using software developed in the
lab.23 The drift times were determined
from the Gaussian function that has the smallest residual sum of squares
with the experimental ATD. CCS values were determined from the slopes
of plots of drift time versus reciprocal drift voltage.

TWIM CCS Measurements
IM-MS analysis was performed
on a Waters Synapt G2-Si HDMS (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) equipped
with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source using nitrogen as the
drift gas. ESI conditions were as follows: capillary, +2.5 kV; sampling
cone, 30 V; extraction cone, 5 V; source temperature, 120 °C;
desolvation temperature, 250 °C; cone gas, 10 L/h; and desolvation
gas, 800 L/h. Mass calibration was performed with sodium formate for
the range m/z 50–1600. IM
separations were performed with a traveling wave velocity of 600 m/s
and height of 40 V. Flow-injection analysis (FIA) was performed with
a Waters Acquity FTN UPLC connected to the ESI source of the IM-MS.
Sample injections (10 μL) were made into a 0.4 mL/min flow of
50% water with 0.1% formic acid/50% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic
acid. Data was acquired for 0.2 min with a 0.5 min scan time over m/z 50–2500, which resulted in approximately
16 scans across the analyte peak. Lock mass signal was not acquired
as it was found to be incompatible with the high-throughput workflow
and the time scale of the high-throughput analysis. Individual data
files were acquired for each well of the 384-well plates, and all
wells were analyzed in triplicates over the course of 2 months. PolyAla
and the mixture of drug-like compounds were added into empty wells
of each plate and were analyzed at the start, middle, and end of the
analysis of each plate.

TWIM CCS Calibration
The nitrogen
DT CCS values for
PolyAla and the drug-like mix were used for calibration of TWIM drift
times into CCS values as described previously (see Table S1 for CCS values).25,26,30 ATDs for PolyAla and drug-like CCS calibrants were
manually extracted from the raw data using the exact mass of the protonated
species and a mass window of 0.075 Da to account for mass drift over
the long analysis times (approximately 6 h per plate). Gaussian fitting
of ATDs was performed in GraphPad Prism 5, and the mean from the best-fit
values was recorded as the drift time of the calibrant ion. Corrected
PolyAla (n = 20) and drug-like mix (n = 9 compounds) drift times (t′d) and corrected DT CCS values (CCS′) were used to generate
a calibration curve of the form CCS′ = A(t′d+t0)B, where A, t0, and B are fit parameters.25,26,30 Calibration errors of ±3%
CCS and interday relative standard deviations ≤0.5% were considered
acceptable.

Data Analysis
Waters .RAW data files
were converted
to text files using the CDCReader.exe included in UniDec.31 IM data was extracted into a separate text file
and binned at 0.05 m/z. A novel
Python program was developed to automate extraction of ATDs in a targeted
manner from the IM text files, perform Gaussian fitting of the ATD,
and generate and apply the CCS calibration curve (see Supporting Information). Briefly, the program
read from an input file containing information on the m/z and CCS values of the calibrants along with directory
paths to the data files, the calibration data file, and the report
file. For each m/z data file combination
specified in the input file, the program extracted its ATD with a
mass window of 0.075 Da, performed a least-squares fit of a Gaussian
function to the ATD, and then used the peak of the Gaussian-fit and
instrumental parameters to calculate the drift time for the analyte.
Extracted drift times and literature CCS values for the calibrants
(PolyAla) were used to generate a CCS calibration function by performing
a least-squares fit of the calibration curve to the corrected drift
time vs literature CCS data.26 The resulting
function was applied to the drift times of the other analytes to calculate
their calibrated CCS. All analyte drift times, CCS calibration parameters,
and calibrated CCS values were recorded in a single text file. Additionally,
during execution the program generates separate image files (PNG)
for each Gaussian fit ATD, as well as a plot of the CCS calibration
with residuals from the fit to the calibration function for visual
inspection. For the first replicate, masses corresponding to the protonated,
sodiated, and water-loss ions were extracted for each data file. The
image files were visually inspected to determine the presence of each
adduct in the data, and the adduct with the largest intensity was
used for ATD extraction in the subsequent replicates. For all replicates,
the image files were inspected for ATD peak shape and intensity. ATDs
with intensities ≤1 × 103 and baseline peak
widths ≥25 bins were rejected. ATDs with more than one peak
were flagged and manually inspected to check that the same mass was
observed in each peak of multimodal ATDs. If the masses were different,
the extraction mass window was adjusted as needed to exclude the contaminate
peak. At a later time, data was manually recalibrated with a CCS calibration
curve based on both the PolyAla and drug mix CCS standards to improve
the calibration results in the low m/z range.

Molecular Modeling and Computational CCS Calculation
Compound structure files were initially generated in Avogadro32 and then parametrized using the Prodrg server33 for use in the GROMACS34 molecular dynamics (MD) suite. Enhanced sampling MD simulations
by GROMACS were carried out to generate unique starting structures.
Briefly, a 1 ns high temperature (600 K) simulation was performed
from which 100 structures were sampled at uniform intervals. The sampled
structures were energy minimized with a steepest-descent algorithm
and then used as the starting structures for individual low temperature
(300 K) MD simulations. The trajectories from all low temperature
simulations were concatenated, producing a single trajectory with
10 000 individual poses. The concatenated trajectory was analyzed
with a clustering algorithm, and highly populated (>25%) clusters
were used as seed structures for further analyses. Potential protomers
of compounds were generated from the clustered structures and optimized
with the MMFF94 force-field in Avogadro using a steepest-descent energy
minimization algorithm. The protomers were then geometry optimized
in Gaussian-0935 using B3LYP DFT with the
3-21G basis set. Further energy-minimized structures were then generated
using the 6-31G+(d) basis set, and Mulliken partial atomic charges
were used. Thermochemistry parameters, vibrational frequencies, and
single point energies for the final optimized structures were calculated
using the 6-31G+(d) basis set. Stability of the optimized structures
was checked by inspecting the output files of the frequency calculations
to ensure no imaginary vibrational modes were predicted. Theoretical
CCS values in nitrogen were obtained from the final optimized structures
using a trajectory method modified for use with N2 as the
IM buffer gas.17

Results and Discussion
CCS Calibration
Performance
Calibration of drift times
using standards of known CCS is a rapid method for obtaining CCS values
from both TWIM and DTIM platforms. A series of singly charged polyalanines
(n = 2–21), PolyAla, were initially used for
CCS calibration of 1425 out of the 2000 compounds in the MicroSource
Discovery Systems, Inc. (MDSI) Spectrum Collection (Figure 1). The PolyAla (Figure 2A) ions have masses ranging
from 161 to 1510 and CCSs of 136 to 379 Å2. Performance
of the PolyAla CCS calibration was benchmarked against the mixture
of drug-like compounds, which had masses ranging from 118 to 1448
and CCSs of 121 to 387 Å2. It was found that calibration
with PolyAla alone lead to higher CCS errors (Table S1) for the drug-like compounds from m/z 100–600, whereas the combination of PolyAla
and drug-like compounds for CCS calibration improved the CCS errors
(Figure 2B) for the
smaller drug-like compounds with the exception of alprenolol and erythromycin,
but both numbers are within 1.5% of the DT CCS values. This improvement
in CCS errors is attributed to the addition of a data point below m/z 160 and an increase in the density
of data points from m/z 100 to 600
in the calibration curve. Calibration errors were less than 1.5% for
the majority (≥95%) of the CCS calibrants. The greatest error
was observed for reserpine, which averaged −2.8% error over
the course of the analysis. Although the CCS error was large, the
reproducibility of the reserpine CCS was high with a RSD of 0.5% and
it was not excluded from the CCS calibration. Measurements of acetaminophen
CCS (not shown in Figure 1A, m/z 152 and 130.4 Å2), however, had poor reproducibility (1.1% RSD) and errors
that exceeded 1.5% at times, which led to its exclusion from the CCS
calibrants. The optimized set of standards yielded CCS calibration
curves with stable values for the A and B fit parameters over the course of the analysis (n = 21), with average values of 444.17 ± 3.84 and 0.513 ±
0.003, respectively. The t0 fit parameter
had the greatest variability over the analysis, with an average value
of −0.065 ± 0.034.

High-Throughput CCS Measurements of Drug and Drug-like Compounds
The FIA-IM-MS and CCS calibration methods were used for the rapid
CCS measurement of the 2000 compounds in the MDSI Spectrum Collection.
The method had an approximate analysis time of 1 min per well, allowing
up to four 384-well plates to be analyzed within a 24 h period. A
total of 1440 CCS values (Figure 2C) representing 1425 unique compounds (71% coverage)
were obtained from analysis of the MDSI Spectrum Collection as 16
of these drugs display two peaks, had two major adducts, or were mixtures
for which we have reported a CCS value of each component (see Supporting Information for the entire dataset).
The CCS values for the rest of the 560 drugs (summarized in Figure S1) were not successfully determined due
to either low peak intensity (<1 × 103 counts)
or the peak being too wide (≥25 bins). Drugs such as inorganic
complexes (e.g., cisplatin and carboplatin), drugs prepared as mixtures
of multiple individual components (e.g., teicoplanin), and drugs with
structures better suited for negative mode analysis (e.g., estradiol)
were among the 560 drugs not determined in this analysis. CCS values
were measured in triplicates and were highly reproducible, with the
majority (≥95%) of CCS values having interday RSDs less than
0.5% (Figure 2D). The
curves plotted in Figure 2C represent approximately ±10% from the center of the
data (dashed lines) as determined by the power fit of the main trendline
(solid line). Data points in Figure 2C are shown at 40% transparency to visualize the density
in various regions of CCS–m/z space. The region within the ±10% lines from m/z 100 to 600 is mostly opaque as this area contains
95% of the measured CCS values. The greatest density of data points
is found from m/z 200 to 400, which
represents 61% of the measured CCS values. The spread of CCS values
at any given m/z value can be visualized
by the ±10% curves. For example, compounds with m/z 300–350 have CCS values ranging from 153
to 210 Å2. Although the majority of CCS values fall
within ±10% threshold, several data points fall well outside
the main trendline. The data points far above the +10% curve, such
as gallamine triethiodide at 510.46 Da and 336.2 Å2, were observed as multiply charged (z ≥
2) species. Notably, one additional data point, bacitracin at 1421
Da and 467 Å2 with a +3 charge, sits outside the CCS
plot area. The compounds that lie below the −10% curve have
unique chemical properties that influence the density of their gas-phase
structure. In addition to the small molecule calibrants used in this
study, CCS values of 31 compounds in this collection have been measured
by DTIM previously by Zhou et al.,36 among
which only four values differ by 3% or more from our measurements
(Table S2). CCS values were obtained in
N2 on the modified Synapt G2 HDMS with RF confining drift
tube (RF-DTIM) for a subset of the compounds in the collection, including
the four compounds that differed greatly from the DTIM CCS values
of Zhou et al. (Table S3). We found that
our calibrated CCS values are in good agreement with (between 0.2
and 2.6% differences) CCS values measured on the RF-DTIM platform,
where our calibrant CCS values were originally measured. However,
the RF-DTIM CCS values are systematically smaller than the DTIM values
reported by Zhou et al. by 2–3% (Table S4). Recently, Alelyunas et al. determined the CCS values of
134 drugs using a similar approach of CCS calibration on a TWIM platform.37 The TWIM CCS values determined here differ by
0.7% on average against the CCS values determined by Alelyunas et
al. (Table S5), with systematically larger
differences (i.e., 2–4% different) for compounds greater than
800 Da, which may arise from differences between the CCS calibrants
used (e.g., the range of m/z and
CCS values of the calibrants or different calibrant and analyte backbone
structures). These results suggest that there may be some inherent
differences between CCS values measured on different DTIM platforms,
as well as between TWIM using different CCS calibrants.

Structural
Diversity of Drug and Drug-Like Compounds
The range of CCS
values observed in Figure 2C indicates a high degree of structural diversity
among drug and drug-like compounds. Distinct trendlines are often
observed in ion mobility data in instances where the compounds share
specific structural characteristics.7,8 The structural
and chemical properties of drugs are directly related to their bioactivities;
thus, drugs with the same or similar bioactivities may show specific
trends in their relationship between CCS and mass. Figure 3 examines the presence of unique
structural trendlines based on the chemical properties and bioactivities
of the 1425 drug and drug-like compounds. CCS values of lipid standards26 (blue, n = 48) and peptides8 (orange, n = 92) are plotted
onto the 1440 CCS values in Figure 3A. The drug trendline deviates from the lipid trendline
near 400 Da and from the peptide trendline at close to 600 Da. In
the range of 400–800 Da, the drugs and peptides occupy similar
conformation space. Above 800 Da, several drug compounds appear to
fall onto the peptide or lipid trendlines, suggesting that these drugs
have structural properties that are similar to those of peptides or
lipids. We note that CCS values determined in this work were measured
with nitrogen gas and, therefore, are systematically larger than those
measured with helium gas due to differences in effective van der Waals
radii, polarizabilities, and other factors.21,24,38

Figure 3 IM-MS conformational space plots showing the
regions occupied by
(A) lipids and peptides; (B) subclasses of antibiotics; (C) compounds
of various densities; and (D) corticosteroid and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs). Structures shown: cephalexin is a cephalosporin antibiotic,
benzalkonium C12 is an amphiphilic ammonium, clioquinol is an antifungal
drug, ibuprofen is a common NSAID, and cortisone is a common corticosteroid.

The peptides with the largest
masses and CCS values in Figure 3A appear to overlay
onto several drug CCS values, suggesting that these drugs have peptide-like
structures. Antibiotics are predominately natural products, and certain
classes of antibiotics are derived from peptides, such as glycopeptides
and lipopeptides. The correlation of CCS and mass for the various
classes of antibiotics is evaluated in Figure 3B. The two cyclic polypeptide antibiotics,
valinomycin and tyrothricin, fall near the peptide trendline shown
in Figure 3A. Macrolides,
which are cyclic polyketides, also appear to be similar in structure
to peptides. In Figure 3B, the macrolides are grouped by the size of the polyketide ring:
14-, 15-, or 16-membered. The macrolides with 16-membered rings tended
to have larger CCS values than those with 14- or 15-membered rings.
Other subclasses of antibacterials shown in Figure 3B include penicillins and cephalosporins,
both of which have a β-lactam core structure. The cephalosporins
cover a wider range of masses and CCSs (350–650 Da, 180–240
Å2) than the penicillins (350–500 Da, 175–205
Å2). This is attributable to the greater diversity
of cephalosporin structures, which can have various side chains on
both sides of the core β-lactam structure. Penicillins, on the
other hand, have only one variable side chain and therefore have a
narrower range of structural diversity. The fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines
also occupy relatively narrow regions of IM-MS space, whereas sulfonamides
cover a wider range (250–400 Da, 145–195 Å2).

The lipid standards lie above the drug CCS trendline
(Figure 3A), which
is expected
as lipids tend to have structural conformations with less gas-phase
density than other molecules.7,8 This region of IM-mass
space also contains many of the drug and drug-like compounds. The
proximity of these data to the lipid trendline suggests that they
share lipid-like structural features that decrease their gas-phase
density. Figure 3C
presents four types of compounds that demonstrate different gas-phase
densities. Two of the four classes fall directly on or slightly above
the +10% curve, which is indicative of lipid-like structures. These
compounds are fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamins E and K, and
topical anti-infective amphiphilic ammonium compounds, such as benzalkonium
chlorides (Figure 3C). Like lipids, fat-soluble vitamins and the amphiphilic ammonium
compounds have structures with long hydrophobic chains, which afford
solubility in lipid-rich tissues. In contrast, water-soluble vitamins
tend to have smaller CCS values even when compared against similar-mass,
fat-soluble vitamins. For example, the CCS value of riboflavin 5-phosphate
(457.1 Da, 197.2 Å2), a derivative of vitamin B2, is approximately 23 Å2 smaller than that
of the synthetic vitamin K phytonadione (451.3 Da, 220.0 Å2). Figure 3C also highlights several compounds that deviate from the main trendline
by up to 25%, such as clioquinol (305.9 Da, 138.2 Å2). These compounds were all found to contain two or more atoms of
iodine, bromine, or chlorine and represent bioactivities such as thyroid
hormones, disinfectants, and radiopaque agents. The presence of multiple
halogen atoms (excluding fluorine) has a greater impact on the mass
of the molecule than its size, leading to an overall increase in the
molecule’s gas-phase density and a smaller CCS value than similar-mass
compounds.

Figure 3D shows
two major classes of anti-inflammatory drugs: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids. While they mostly fall onto the
main drug trendline and are separated from each class by mass, the
structures did display large diversity within each class. For example,
the corticosteroids fluocinonide and diflorasone diacetate have the
same mass but a CCS difference of 20 Å2 (229.9 vs
209.5 Å2). Plots of additional classes of drugs are
shown in the Supporting Information, including
antifungal (P450 inhibitors), antihistamines, antiarrhythmic (Na channel
blockers), vasolilators and bronchodilators (beta agonists, Ca channel
blockers, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors), antihypertensives (agonists
and blockers of alpha or beta adrenergic receptors), anticholinergics,
antidiabetics (K channel blockers), etc. (Figures S2–S12).

of Some Drugs
in the Gas Phase
One interesting observation of this data
set is that several compounds displayed bimodal ATDs, yielding two
major CCS values (Figures 4, S13, and S14–S22). This
indicates a contribution from two distinct conformational or isomeric
structures or the presence of protomers. Among the compounds displaying
this behavior were cefpodoxime proxetil (Figure 4), a β-lactam cephalosporin antibiotic,
and several compounds of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic class (Figure S13). The presence of fluoroquinolone
protomers and the capability of IM-MS to resolve these protomers have
been demonstrated previously by Kaufman et al., Lapthorn et al., and
Stead et al., who found that the two major protomers observed in IM-MS
separations using N2 had distinct fragmentation patterns
in addition to unique drift times.39−41 Our own results on the
postmobility fragmentation of ciprofloxacin protomers (Figures S23 and S24) is consistent with the fragmentation
patterns reported by Stead et al.41 Postmobility
fragmentation of cefpodoxime proxetil (Figures S25 and S26) also revealed distinct fragmentation patterns
at the apex of each ATD peak. On the basis of these results, we evaluated
the presence of protomers for cefpodoxime proxetil, which has not
been studied previously, and determined the impact of protonation
site on the gas-phase structures of cefpodoxime proxetil and the three
fluoroquinolones (enoxacin, ciprofloxacin, and sarafloxacin) using
MD modeling and theoretical CCS calculations following a protocol
adapted from previous methods43 (see Experimental Section).

Figure 4 (A) Conformation of cefpodoxime
proxetil, obtained through molecular
modeling, that had a theoretical CCS value 0.65% different than that
of lower experimental CCS value; (B) bimodal ATD of cefpodoxime proxetil
annotated with the experimental CCS values; (C) conformation of cefpodoxime
proxetil, obtained through molecular modeling, that had a theoretical
CCS value 0.97% different than that of the higher experiment CCS value.

For all three fluoroquinolones
modeled (ciprofloxacin, enoxacin,
and sarafloxacin), the low energy structures generated showed protonation
on the terminal nitrogen of the piperazine ring regardless of substitution
(i.e., cyclopropyl, ethyl, and benzyl, respectively) and matched the
larger experimentally obtained CCS that corresponded to the major
peak in the ATD (Figure S13). Although
Lapthorn et al. sugggested that protomers at both the carboxylic carbonyl
and the quinolone carbonyl contribute to the component with smaller
CCS,40 our own Gaussian computation (DFT
B3LYP/3-21G) results suggest that protonation at the carboxylic acid
carbonyl rearranges to the quinolone carbonyl (as shown in Figure S23).

Two clustered structures were
obtained for cefpodoxime proxetil,
and four protomers were produced from each clustered structure. One
protomer with protonation at the nitrogen atom of the thiazole ring
was found with a theoretical CCS value that is within 0.5% of the
smaller experimentally measured CCS (Figure 4A). This structure had the lowest energy
relative to the other protomers optimized at the same basis. A protomer
with the next lowest energy (approximately 15 kcal/mol higher), with
protonation at the nitrogen atom of the β-lactam, displays a
CCS value that is within 0.8% of the larger experimentally measured
CCS value (Figure 4C). In a thermodynamically controlled reaction, the higher energy
protomers are expected to have essentially no contribution to the
structural ensemble at relevant temperatures. However, it has been
demonstrated that under some circumstances, such as steric hindrance
and different reaction environments (gas phase vs solution phase),
the observed protomers produced by ESI may reflect kinetically controlled
products instead of thermodynamically controlled products.44 Thus, although the protomer shown in Figure 4C was predicted to
be thermodynamically disfavored, it may represent a product of a kinetically
controlled process. The major structural difference observed between
the two protomers is a rotation of the aminothiazole substituent relative
to the β-lactam core from a more compact, downward-facing orientation
in the smaller CCS structure to a more extended, upward-facing orientation
in the larger CCS structure. Large differences in CCS values between
different protomers of glucuronides were recently reported by Reading
et al., which provides support to our results.21

Application of the IM-MS Method to Drug Products
The
collection of CCS values for drug and drug-like compounds offers a
means of identifying drug analytes from complex mixtures such as formulated
drug products. The high-throughput FIA-IM-MS method was applied to
the analysis of clindamycin in a 300 mg capsule. The Python script
was used to obtain the drift time of clindamycin in the capsule sample,
and the PolyAla + Drug CCS curve was applied to generate the CCS value
of clindamycin. Figure 5 shows the ATDs for clindamycin (m/z 425.2) from the standard and from a 1 ng/mL solution of the clindamycin
capsule with an estimated clindamycin concentration of 0.5 ng/mL (see Figure S27 for the 2D-IM-MS plot). The CCS value
of clindamycin in the capsule was determined to be 201.0 Å2, which is 0.2% different from the CCS obtained from the analysis
of the standard (200.6 Å2). Notably, these samples
were analyzed several months apart and the CCS values were generated
from different calibration curves. These results suggest that our
library of drug CCS values may be a valuable resource of discriminating
information in the confirmation of the active ingredient in a drug
product.

Figure 5 Comparison of the arrival time distribution (ATD) of the clindamycin
standard in the Spectrum Collection (solid black line) and that of
clindamycin from a 300 mg capsule prepared as a 1 ng/mL (approximately
0.5 ng/mL clindamycin) solution (dotted red line). The CCS values
of clindamycin from the Spectrum Collection and the capsule are different
by 0.2%.

Conclusions
High-throughput
IM-MS measurements and a streamlined analysis workflow
enabled the determination of CCS values for ions of 1425 unique drug
or drug-like molecules (Figure 2C). These molecules have diverse bioactivities (Figure 1), span a broad range of masses
(118–1448 Da), and yield ions with CCS values ranging from
121 to 387 Å2. We demonstrated the use of these CCS
values for relating the structure and function of drugs (Figure 3), characterizing
the multiple structures of protonated cefpodoxime proxetil (Figure 4) and identifying
the bioactive molecule in a formulation (Figure 5). We anticipate that these results will
be used (1) to improve the confidence in drug and drug metabolite
identification, (2) to classify the potential bioactivities of new
candidate molecules, based on their location in CCS–mass space,
and (3) as benchmarks for the development of more general methods
for calculating CCS values.
