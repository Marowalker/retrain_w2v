We
present a novel setup that can be used for the in-line monitoring
of solid-catalyzed gas–liquid reactions. The method combines
the high sensitivity and resolution of a stripline NMR detector with
a microfluidic network that can withstand elevated pressures. In our
setup we dissolve hydrogen gas in the solvent, then flow it with the
added substrate through a catalyst cartridge, and finally flow the
reaction mixture directly through the stripline NMR detector. The
method is quantitative and can be used to determine the solubility
of hydrogen gas in liquids; it allows in-line monitoring of hydrogenation
reactions and can be used to determine the reaction kinetics of these
reactions. In this work, as proof of concept we demonstrate the optimization
of the Pd-catalyzed hydrogenation reactions of styrene, phenylacetylene,
cyclohexene, and hex-5-en-2-one in a microfluidic context.

==== Body
Since the
transition from alchemy
to chemistry as a science, chemists have made use of glass flasks
(e.g., Erlenmeyer and round-bottom flasks) or large stainless steel
vessels. At the end of the 20th century microreactors were introduced
into the field of chemistry. These submillimeter flow reactors provide
several advantages over large-volume batch processes performed in
flasks or reaction vessels, namely, faster mixing, better control
over reaction times and temperature (excellent heat exchange), continuous
operation, improved safety, the capability to work at high pressures
without major modifications to the setup, and finally the possibility
to work at higher concentrations. As a result, microreactor synthesis
can be more sustainable and economic.1

The change from a batch process to a continuous process requires
a continuous monitoring of the reaction process by in- and online
analysis. The difference between the two is that for online analysis
a fraction of the reaction mixture is separated from the main reaction
volume and directed through a detector before it is reunited with
the main reaction volume, whereas in in-line analysis the detection
is done directly on the main reaction volume. In- or online analysis
of a reaction mixture can provide valuable information about reactive
intermediates and reaction kinetics, and it makes on-the-fly optimization
of the reaction possible. Therefore, in- or online versions of the
most-used spectroscopic techniques, i.e., UV, IR, Raman, and fluorescence,
were developed.2 One of the most information-rich
techniques in chemical analysis is NMR; it not only provides structural
information but also gives quantitative results. Both online3−8 and in-line NMR techniques8−15 exist. Noteworthy are the setups in which benchtop NMR systems are
used.16−20 Although the sensitivity and chemical shift dispersion of these
systems are smaller compared to the high-field systems, the costs
are more than an order of magnitude lower and no cryogenics are needed.

Microfluidic setups work fine as long as all of the reactants remain
liquid or dissolved. However, several problems are to be expected
if one of the components is a gas. The gas may cause instability in
the flow rate, the in-line pressure, and the heat conductivity. In
the case of multiple flow routes or a catalyst cartridge it can block
certain flow routes or volume sections of the cartridge, thereby decreasing
the total reaction volume. NMR-wise the gas not only decreases the
signal intensity but is also detrimental for the spectral resolution
because of the magnetic susceptibility difference between the gas
and the liquid. In this work we circumvent this problem by dissolving
the gas into the solvent at elevated pressures (up to 7 bar). Standard
NMR tubes are not strong enough to safely handle these pressures.
However, fused silica capillaries as used in the present study can
withstand pressures well over 100 bar, as demonstrated by van Meerten
et al.21

Performing NMR in-flow in
a capillary requires a special setup.
The NMR coil has to be adapted so that its dimensions match those
of the capillary in order to obtain a maximum signal-to-noise ratio.
Many microcoils have been developed for this purpose. Van Bentum et
al.22,23 introduced the stripline geometry in NMR
as a new radiofrequency (RF) detector that can readily be scaled in
size to match small volume samples. Its sensitivity and particularly
resolution are better than most other microcoils, and it was shown
that stripline NMR can easily be combined with microfluidics to monitor
chemical reactions in flow.12,13,24

Here we demonstrate the in-line monitoring of the hydrogenation
of styrene (Scheme 1) and other substrates using stripline NMR. The hydrogen gas is dissolved
in a substrate solution at elevated pressures with a tube-in-tube
system,25,26 which consists of a hydrogen-permeable tube
inserted in an impermeable tube so that gas in the outer tube can
diffuse into the liquid inside the inner tube. The hydrogen-rich mixture
is led through a cartridge filled with polyurea-supported Pd catalyst
particles, resulting in a heterogeneously catalyzed hydrogenation
reaction. The reactions are performed at room temperature, and the
product mixture is directly monitored by in-line stripline NMR (Figure 1).

Buser and McFarland27 already
demonstrated
online NMR monitoring of hydrogenation reactions at elevated pressures.
The main differences between their work and our work is that they
created an online setup with a large (100 mL) reaction vessel and
a custom-made NMR flow tube for detection, whereas we created an in-line
setup in which the reaction is performed in a small (208 μL)
stainless steel cartridge filled with catalyst and a stripline NMR
probe, dedicated for NMR experiments on small-volume samples in capillaries.

Experimental
Section
In-Flow Hydrogenation and Stripline NMR Monitoring Setup
A substrate solution, contained in a 5 mL gastight syringe (ILS,
2607044), is pumped with a syringe pump (New Era, NE-1000) through
a 50 cm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing (250 μm i.d.,
1.59 mm o.d.) connected via a PEEK luer lock connector (IDEX Health
& Science, P-659) from the syringe to a gas module (Future Chemistry,
B-480). This gas module contains a tube-in-tube gas dissolver, which
is 50 cm long and consists of an impermeable fluorinated ethylene–propylene
(FEP) outer tubing (1.57 mm i.d., 3.2 mm o.d.) and a gas-permeable
inner tubing (Teflon Amorphous Fluoropolymer AF-2400, 0.61 mm i.d.,
0.81 mm o.d.). Hydrogen gas is stored in a pressurized cylinder, which
is connected to the gas module with FEP tubing. The outlet of the
gas module, 250 cm PTFE tubing (250 μm i.d., 1.59 mm o.d.),
transports the hydrogen-saturated solution to the catalyst cartridge,
a 20 cm long stainless steel tube (IDEX Health & Science, U-147,
1.15 mm i.d., 1.59 mm o.d.) that is completely filled with catalyst
particles (113 mg) and closed on both sides with in-line PEEK filters
(IDEX Health & Science, A-430). The other side of the catalyst
cartridge is connected to a 140 cm long fused silica capillary (Polymicro
Technologies, 250 μm i.d., 360 μm o.d.) that is inserted
in the stripline NMR probe and exits the bottom of the probe in a
pressurized reservoir. The distance between the catalyst cartridge
and the detection point of the stripline probe is 50 cm (volume 25
μL). The catalyst cartridge is attached to the NMR probe and
is placed inside the bore of the NMR magnet; thus, reaction and detection
both take place inside the magnet. In principle, the cartridge can
also be located outside the magnet, further away from the detection
point. However, because it has a relatively large volume compared
to a piece of tubing of similar length, we can increase the build-up
time of the magnetization without increasing the total length of the
fluidic network by placing the cartridge in the center of the magnet.

The final product solution is collected in a reservoir that is
pressurized with nitrogen gas. This is done to keep the entire flow
system pressurized and to prevent the formation of gas bubbles before
the reaction or the detection of the reaction mixture. The same can
in principle be done by a back-pressure regulator; however, we found
this solution to be more stable. The nitrogen pressure is accurately
regulated by a pressure-based flow controller (Fluigent, MFCS). All
reactions were performed at room temperature.

Chemicals
Pd microencapsulated
in polyurea (Pd Encat
30, 0.4 mmol/g Pd loading, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as hydrogenation
catalyst. Chloroform was obtained from Fisher Scientific. Cyclohexene
and phenylacetylene were obtained from Alfa Aesar. Styrene and hex-5-en-2-one
from Sigma-Aldrich and hydrogen gas from Linde Gas. All chemicals
were used as received and none of the solvents were degassed.

NMR Experiments
and Data Treatment
All NMR experiments
in this work are single-pulse excitation 1H NMR measurements
performed at 600 MHz using a stripline NMR probe on a 14.1 T (Oxford
600/89 magnet) Varian NMR system (VNMRS), operating under the VNMRJ
software. The stripline NMR probe was designed and produced in house
and contains a stripline chip with a constriction (the detection area)
that is 9.0 mm long and 400 μm wide. Technical fabrication details
of the stripline chip can be found in the work of Oosthoek-De Vries
et al.24

In the pressure-dependent
(Figure 2) and flow
rate-dependent (Figure S3) hydrogen concentration
measurements, a 1H NMR spectrum was acquired every 2 s
at a flow rate of 80 μL/min or 5 s for the measurements performed
at flow rates of 60 μL/min or less. The flow was allowed to
stabilize until all of the peaks in the NMR spectrum reached a constant
value. This usually took 10–30 min depending on the flow rate.

gas pressure (PH). Flow rate chloroform
= 80 μL/min.

For each set of conditions,
160–800 scans were averaged
to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The spectral width was 10 kHz,
and the excitation pulse was between 1.5 and 2.5 μs (100–160
kHz rf field strength). Processing of all NMR experiments was done
using the MATLAB-based processing package matNMR.28

On the basis of an estimation of the errors in the
various parts
of the experiments (Supporting Information), the accumulated error in the system should be limited to the percent
range, thus allowing reliable determination of the kinetic parameters.

For the flow-conversion measurements of the four substrates the
NMR spectra were acquired in blocks of 32 scans. Later, during processing,
the signals were integrated and plotted to determine when the system
was sufficiently stabilized (Figure S1).
The spectra acquired after that point were averaged to obtain the
conversion percentages. The hydrogen pressure was 7 bar in all cases,
whereas the nitrogen back-pressure was set to 5.5 bar. All measurements
were performed at room temperature. The recycle delay was adjusted
to the flow rate and chosen such that the entire detection volume
was refreshed with new sample before each scan. To ensure quantitative
data, one should wait for the magnetization to completely build up
(3–5 times T1). Typical T1 relaxation values for the substrates used
are 4–5 s. For H2 gas dissolved in chloroform we
found a shorter T1 relaxation time of
1.1 s. The polarization build-up time is the duration that the reaction
mixture spends in the high magnetic field before detection; therefore,
it is inversely proportional to the flow rate. In our system the catalyst
cartridge is placed near the center of the magnet, and thus, the build-up
time is equal to the reaction time in the catalyst cartridge (Figure 3c) plus the time
needed to transfer the mixture from the cartridge to the stripline
detector. At the highest flow rate used in this work (300 μL/min)
these times are 15 and 5 s, respectively, i.e., no additional relaxation
delays are needed to warrant quantitative evaluation of the spectra.

Results
Hydrogen Solubility
The setup was first used to determine
the concentration of the dissolved hydrogen gas. There are several
methods to measure the gas concentration, or solubility, in a liquid.
However, most of them are indirect and measure a change in volume.
With NMR the H2 gas can be observed directly and in situ.27,30,31(Note that the peak area of the
hydrogen gas corresponds to the hydrogen concentration in the same
way as for all other compounds, despite the fact that the spins are
identical and therefore occur in the NMR visible triplet and the NMR
invisible singlet state. As is clearly explained by Canet et al.,29 at equilibrium ortho/para hydrogen ratios the
integrated intensity of an A2 spin system
equals that of an AX system.)

The hydrogen
solubility in chloroform was studied at different gas pressures (Figure 2), while the chloroform
flow rate was kept constant at 80 μL/min. We found a linear
dependence of the solubility on the gas pressure, in accordance with
Henry’s law, and obtained a hydrogen solubility of 2.17 ±
0.08 mM/bar at room temperature (20 °C), which is slightly lower
than the literature values: 2.4832 and
2.61 mM/bar.33

Next we decided to
take a closer look at the effect of the flow
rate. Because the volumes of both the tube-in-tube gas dissolver and
the catalyst cartridge are fixed, a change in flow rate will affect
the residence time in both compartments. First, we analyzed the performance
of the tube-in-tube gas dissolver. Our hypothesis was that at low
flow rates the residence time will be long enough to reach maximum
hydrogen solubility. At higher flow rates the residence time will
become shorter and the concentration of dissolved gas could go down,
as reported by Yang and Jensen.34 However,
we observe a different trend; the concentration of hydrogen dissolved
in chloroform drops at lower flow rates, whereas it keeps increasing
(nonlinearly) with increasing flow rate up to 200 μL/min (Figure S3). As discussed in section S2 of the Supporting Information, we ruled out a number
of explanations for this peculiar behavior. The possibility of gas
leaks was excluded, and we deem an explanation based on local turbulences
very unlikely. Furthermore, we optically inspected the behavior of
the tube-in-tube design under different differential pressures to
check whether the inner tube could (partly) collapse. A logical explanation
would be that the back pressure in the system rises significantly
to pressures above the set hydrogen gas pressure. This would then
increase the hydrogen solubility because of the increase in overall
pressure. Such large pressure increases are not expected, however,
under the flow rates used in this study. The calculated back pressure
based on the Poiseuille formula for frictional pressure drop for our
system amounts to a maximum pressure drop of approximately 1 bar at
a flow rate of approximately 200 μL/min. Moreover, under laminar
flow one would expect a linear increase in pressure with flow rate
and therefore also an linear increase in solubility, which is not
what we observe. Nevertheless, we hypothesize that the internal liquid
pressure plays a role. As the flow rate is increased a larger pressure
drop over the entire length of the microfluidic system is expected.
Thus, the syringe pumps will increase the liquid pressure to reach
the flow rate to which they are set. This increase in pressure on
the liquid should then result in an increased uptake of hydrogen gas
and thus a higher hydrogen solubility. Clearly, the observed solubility
behavior calls for a more in-depth study of hydrogen concentrations
as a function of flow rate, hydrogen pressure, and tube-in-tube design
parameters. It should be noted that in a recent paper by Utz and co-workers,35 based on a different design, deviations between
the simulated concentration profiles and the experimentally observed
ones were reported. These observations show that in situ calibration
of the hydrogen concentration is of great importance and that NMR
is a convenient tool to do so.

Hydrogenation Reactions
We investigated the hydrogenation
of four substrates: styrene, cyclohexene, phenylacetylene, and hex-5-en-2-one.
For all four substrates an initial concentration of 10 mM was chosen.
At low flow rates there is not enough hydrogen dissolved for full
conversion of the substrates, whereas at higher flow rates an excess
of hydrogen is present. However, at higher flow rates the residence
time of the substrate and hydrogen in the catalyst cartridge is decreasing.
We thus observe an optimum flow rate for each substrate.

Styrene
The hydrogenation of styrene into ethylbenzene
is a fast and well-studied reaction.36,37 In our setup
it takes place inside the catalyst cartridge. Once the reaction mixture
leaves this cartridge the reaction stops and the mixture of ethylbenzene,
unreacted styrene, and hydrogen is transported into the NMR probe,
where we can detect all three compounds (Figure 4). From the observed ethylbenzene and leftover
hydrogen, the initial hydrogen concentration was calculated (Figure 3a). This concentration
profile was fitted with a polynomial (cubic function), which was subsequently
used for fitting of the conversion profiles. The initial hydrogen
concentration profile is similar in shape to the concentration profile
in Figure S3; however, the concentrations
are slightly lower. The reason for this is unknown, but small changes
in the hydrogen pressure, back pressure, and temperature as well as
small errors in the integration of the NMR signals may contribute
to this difference. The plot of the hydrogen concentration after the
reaction (Figure 3b)
indeed shows that there is no more hydrogen left after the reaction
at low flow rates and that there is an excess at higher flow rates.
The reaction time is equal to the residence time of the reaction mixture
in the catalyst cartridge, which can be calculated as a function of
the flow rate. For this we need to know the packing density of the
cartridge. Since the catalyst particles used are polydisperse spheres
(150–250 μm diameter) and the theoretical maximum packing
of polydisperse spheres does not deviate much (0–4% for the
Pd particle size range38) from monodisperse
spheres, we assumed the packing of the catalyst cartridge to be close
to the maximum random close packing of monodisperse spheres,39 thus occupying 63% of the 208 μL cartridge.
The calculated reaction time as a function of the flow rate is given
in Figure 3c. Even
though the reaction times are long at low flow rates, the conversion
will be low because there is not enough hydrogen present, whereas
at very high flow rates there is an excess of hydrogen but also a
very short reaction time, resulting again in low conversions, and
this is exactly what we see if we calculate the conversion from the
ethylbenzene concentration (Figure 3d). A flow rate between 50 and 90 μL/min gives
an optimal conversion of 90–95%.

Figure 4 NMR spectra of the reaction
mixture of the hydrogenation of styrene
(544 scans), phenylacetylene (1920 scans), cyclohexene (2560 scans),
and hex-5-en-2-one (2080 scans). Asterisks mark impurities in the
solvent (CHCl3, 7.26 ppm). Peak at 1.6 ppm is water. Conversion
percentages are the maximum conversions and do not necessarily match
with the spectra. For all spectra and conversion numbers the initial
substrate concentration is 10 mM, except for the styrene spectrum,
which was recorded for a concentration of 100 mM.

In principle, it should be possible to extract the rate constant
from this conversion data. Thus, the data was fitted based on a simple
second-order reaction (Scheme 2, model 1); however, this fit clearly does not match the data
well (Figure 3d, model
1). The fit gives a too low maximum conversion and overestimates the
conversion at high flow rates. Therefore, we expanded our reaction
scheme by explicitly including the function of the Pd catalyst (Scheme 2, model 2). The palladium
catalyst first splits the molecular hydrogen and stores it; then in
a second step the palladium-bound atomic hydrogen reacts with the
substrate to form the hydrogenated product. Now, because the reaction
is performed in flow and with an excess of hydrogen (at higher flow
rates), it means that the amount of bound hydrogen (Pd–H) can
build up and is not necessarily zero at the start of the reaction,
as it would be in a batch reaction.

Scheme 2 Reaction Models for
the Hydrogenation Reactions
The amount of palladium in the cartridge was 45.2 mmol (encapsulated
in polyurea spheres with a 150–250 μm diameter). We assumed
that 100% of the Pd is available for the reaction, which gives a Pd
concentration of 0.217 M. Fitting based on this second model matches
the conversion data well (Figure 3d). However, the accuracy of the fitted rate constants
(k1 = 0.16 ± 0.03 L·mol–1·s–1 and k2 = 0.59 ± 0.15 L·mol–1·s–1) is limited, as the scatter in the conversion data
is substantial and the number of points is rather low. Nevertheless,
the fit does give a reasonable estimate of the size of the rate constants.
For more quantitative numbers more data points have to be acquired
and other parameters can be varied, for instance, the substrate concentration
or the volume or loading of the catalyst cartridge (Figure S5).

The conversion of styrene into ethylbenzene
peaked at a flow rate
of 70 μL/min, giving a conversion of 93%. For the other substrates
similar flow-conversion data were gathered (Figures S6–S8). In all cases a substrate concentration of 10
mM was used.

Phenylacetylene
Phenylacetylene
can react twice with
hydrogen. In the first step styrene is formed, which reacts into ethylbenzene.
We see a maximum styrene concentration at a flow rate of 40 μL/min
(Figure S6) when there is not enough H2 dissolved to let the phenylacetylene fully react into ethylbenze.
At that flow rate 15% of the phenylacetylene is reacted into styrene.
At higher flow rates the final styrene concentration slightly decreases,
whereas the ethylbenzene concentration keeps increasing up to a flow
rate of 200 μL/min. At that flow rate 88% of the substrate has
been converted into ethylbenzene (80%) and styrene (8%). For this
system the hydrogen concentration is limiting the conversion; only
at the highest flow rates an initial hydrogen concentration of 20
mM, which is the minimum for a full conversion into ethylbenzene,
is reached.

Cyclohexene
The hydrogenation of
cyclohexene exhibits
a conversion profile similar to that of styrene (Figure S7) with a maximum conversion of only 10% at a flow
rate of roughly 60 μL/min. Apparently the rate constant for
this hydrogenation reaction is too low to reach a higher conversion
in the time the reaction mixture flows through the cartridge. Thus,
either a longer cartridge or elevated temperatures are needed to obtain
a higher conversion.

Hex-5-en-2-one
The reaction of hex-5-en-2-one
with
H2 in the presence of the Pd catalyst is a special case,
because not only does the substrate convert into 2-hexanone via hydrogenation
but also it isomerizes into both (E)-hex-4-en-2-one
and (Z)-hex-4-en-2-one (Figure 4). Both the Pd catalyst and the H2 have to be present for this isomerization to occur. Unfortunately,
the resonances of the methyl protons (1.6–1.7 ppm) and the
protons attached to the double bond (5.5–5.6 ppm) overlap in
the spectrum and cannot be used to distinguish the two hex-4-en-2-one
isomers. However, the peaks of the protons on the C3 carbon (doublets
at 3.11 and 3.19 ppm) are well separated and can be integrated. On
the basis of the different J couplings we assume
that the doublet at 3.11 ppm (5.6 Hz) is the E isomer
and the doublet at 3.19 ppm (7.3 Hz) is the Z isomer.
The isomer ratio is roughly 2:1 (E: Z), and a larger percentage of hex-5-en-2-one isomerizes at lower
flow rates (52% at 40 μL/min compared to 40% at 150 μL/min, Figure S8) when the reaction time is long and
the hydrogen concentration is low. The hydrogenation conversion is
around 40% at all tested flow rates. The maximum conversion into 2-hexanone
that we measured is 44% at 80 μL/min. At that flow rate 46%
of the starting material (hex-5-en-2-one) is converted to and detected
as one of the two hex-4-en-2-one isomers. The hex-4-en-2-one isomers
can also be hydrogenated, and it is likely that a fraction of the
detected 2-hexanone originates from hydrogenated hex-4-en-2-one. More
in-depth characterization is needed to determine the rate constants
for the hydrogenation of both hex-5-en-2-one and hex-4-en-2-one.

Conclusions and Outlook
We created a microfluidic flow
setup in which solid-catalyzed gas–liquid
reactions can take place, allowing direct monitoring of the reaction
product by in-line stripline NMR detection. We have shown that this
setup can be used to study heterogeneously catalyzed hydrogenation
reactions. Dissolving the gas in the solvent at elevated pressures
makes the microfluidic system more stable and prevents spectral distortions
that can occur in a plug-flow system, in which gas and liquid plugs
are alternated. Some instability was observed during the initial 10–30
min after changing the flow rate. We expect that this stabilization
period can be shortened in the future by integrating a pump, tube-in-tube
gas dissolver, and sample collector in the NMR probe and thereby reducing
the length of the tubing and capillaries.

The high sensitivity
of the stripline in combination with the microfluidic
capillary allows one to perform NMR measurements at elevated pressures.
In this work we used pressures up to 8 bar; however, the capillary
can withstand pressures well over 100 bar. Besides higher pressures,
the size of the cartridge can be adjusted to change the reaction time
or the cartridge can be swapped for other microreactors, for instance,
microchannel reactors in which the catalyst is immobilized to the
channel wall.

Our study underlines the importance of in-line
monitoring of the
hydrogen concentration. In flow systems it cannot be taken for granted
that the dissolved gas concentration is maximized and independent
of the solvent flow rate. Simulations based on a multitude of parameters
may predict concentrations for simple idealized flow systems;34 however, this might turn out quite different
in more complicated flow systems as presented here and elsewhere.35 Without in situ determination of the hydrogen
concentration, any attempt to determine a reaction mechanism, or even
reaction yield, is flawed. With our stripline NMR setup the dissolved
hydrogen gas can be calibrated with ease.

One drawback of our
method is that the substrate concentration
is limited by the solubility of hydrogen in the solvent used. A solution
for this might be to “charge” the catalyst with plugs
of hydrogen gas. When a hydrogen gas plug enters the cartridge the
catalyst adsorbs the hydrogen. Later, when a solution plug flows through
the catalyst, the catalyst “discharges” as the adsorbed
hydrogen reacts in the hydrogenation of the substrate. In such a plug-flow
method, plugs of hydrogen gas and substrate solution are thus alternated
to adsorb large quantities of hydrogen and to hydrogenate high substrate
concentrations. Such an approach has been described for solid-catalyzed
hydrogenation reactions.40,41

The method presented
here is not limited to hydrogenation reactions,
so many more reactions can be monitored using this approach. By placing
the cartridge right over the stripline one may even directly observe
what happens at the catalyst. By changing the stripline chip for a
tapered stripline chip13 one can observe
concentration profiles over the catalyst cartridge similar to MRI-type
experiments.42−44 Depending on their lifetime, it may even be possible
to observe catalytic species and intermediates directly, because the
amount of catalyst is high compared to the amount of substrate which
is in the cartridge at any point in time. Heterogeneously catalyzed
hydrogenation reactions have been studied for many decades, and although
there is a general consensus that the Horiuti–Polanyi mechanism45,46 is the underlying mechanism for the addition of H2 to
alkenes and alkynes, there are still many unanswered questions.47 What are the effects of olefin decomposition
reactions on the reactivity of the catalyst? What determines the selectivity
of the reaction? How do different crystal surfaces and nanoparticle
sizes affect the hydrogenation process? Using our setup it is possible
to study hydrogenation reactions and their catalysts in situ and might
therefore provide answers to the questions stated above.

A final
opportunity for our setup lies in the combination of our
setup with parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP),48,49 which is a technique that uses the special properties of one of
the spin isomers of hydrogen, the so-called parahydrogen, to get a
signal enhancement of a factor 100–10 000. This allows
one to detect molecules in much lower concentrations. This can benefit
the detection of unwanted low-concentration side products or the study
of catalytic reaction mechanisms by easier detection of short-lived
catalytic species and reaction intermediates. Note that in this case
the Pd catalyst needs to be replaced by a catalyst that preserves
the spin correlation of the parahydrogen. In the literature there
are already multiple examples50−53 of studies that successfully use PHIP to investigate
hydrogenation mechanisms, kinetics, and the effects of support materials,
particle sizes, and different crystal facets, most notably by the
group of Koptyug.54−56 Recently, it was shown that PHIP hyperpolarization
can be achieved in similar continuous flow setups in which hydrogen
dissolved in a liquid by diffusion through a membrane.35,57,58
