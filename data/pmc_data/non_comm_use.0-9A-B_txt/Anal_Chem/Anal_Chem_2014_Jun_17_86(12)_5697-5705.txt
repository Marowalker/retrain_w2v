A simple,
fast approach elucidated carbon–carbon double
bond positions in unsaturated lipids. Lipids were deposited onto various
surfaces and the products from their oxidation in ambient air were
observed by electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS).
The most common oxidative products, aldehydes, were detected as transformations
at the cleaved double bond positions. Ozonides and carboxylic acids
were generated in certain lipids. Investigations of the conditions
controlling the appearance of these products indicated that the surface
oxidation depends on light and ambient air. Since the lipid oxidation
was slower in a high concentration of ozone, singlet oxygen appeared
to be a parallel oxidant for unsaturated lipids. The 3-hydroxyl group
in the sphingoid base of sulfatides offered some protection from oxidation
for the Δ4,5-double bond, slowing its oxidation rate relative
to that of the isolated double bond in the N-linked
fatty acyl chain. Direct sampling by thin-layer chromatography (TLC)-ESI-MS
provides a powerful approach to elucidate detailed structural information
on biological samples. Co-localization of the starting lipids and
their oxidation products after TLC separation allowed assignment of
the native unsaturation sites. Phosphatidylserine and N,N-dimethyl phosphatidylethanolamine isomers in
a bovine brain total lipid extract were distinguished on the basis
of their oxidation products. Meanwhile, the findings reported herein
reveal a potential pitfall in the assignment of structures to lipids
extracted from TLC plates because of artifactual oxidation after the
plate development.

==== Body
Lipids comprise a very diverse
and complex group of molecules that are insoluble in water and soluble
in organic solvents. The main biological functions of lipids include
their central roles as reservoirs for energy storage, as structural
components of cell membranes, and as important signaling molecules.1,2 The complex structural heterogeneity within lipid categories originates
from variations in the numbers and lengths of fatty acyl chains, degrees
of unsaturation, double bond positions, head groups, etc.

Lipid
oxidation can be produced by a free radical chain reaction
that is initiated either by removing an electron from an alkyl moiety
or oxygen, or by changing the electron spin of the oxygen.3,4 Reactive oxygen species can be produced in the ambient environment.
Singlet oxygen and ozone are the most well-known nonradical oxygen
species. Singlet oxygen can be generated through various means and
reacts readily with lipid double bonds. A very common, important route
for generation of singlet oxygen is exposure of oxygen (air) to light
in the presence of a photosensitizer.5 Metals
can react with O2 and initiate lipid oxidation via formation
of a metal–hydroperoxide catalyst complex.6 Irradiation of nontransition-metal oxide powders (e.g.,
silica gel, aluminum oxide, and magnesium oxide), in the presence
of oxygen, results in the formation of singlet oxygen.7 Wynalda and Murphy have reported that low concentrations
of environmental ozone react with phospholipids in lung surfactant.4 Ozonoloysis at unsaturated sites in lipids has
been attributed to O3 at ambient levels (∼30–40
ppb).8 Unsaturated lipids can produce ozonides
at carbon–carbon double bond positions by the Criegee mechanism.9 Therefore, lipid oxidation often compromises
the interpretation and identification of lipid structures.

Since
lipid structural details strongly affect their biological
activities, precise determination of unsaturation sites is essential.
For the identification, structural determination, and quantitation
of lipids, different mass spectrometry (MS) ionization techniques
are used: electron ionization (EI),10 fast
atom bombardment (FAB),11 electrospray
ionization (ESI),12 matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization (MALDI),13 and desorption
electrospray ionization (DESI).14 Recently,
Mitchell et al. have reviewed MS methods to determine the positions
of double bonds in lipids.15 Several techniques,
for example, collision-induced dissociation (CID) tandem MS, covalent
adduct chemical ionization, CID MS/MS of diols and ozonides generated
by double bond oxidation, ozone electrospray ionization (ESI), and
ozone-induced dissociation (OzID), provide such information. However,
these techniques usually require multistep sample preparations (hydrolysis
and derivatization), instrumental modification, or special equipment,
and have limitations, in that most of these methods cannot assign
the double bond positions with accuracy and efficiency. It has been
reported that the location of the double bonds on the unsaturated
fatty acyl groups can be assigned by a linear ion-trap multiple-stage
mass spectrometric approach on the lithiated adduct of the unsaturated
lipids. MS2 was sufficient for localization of the double
bond in unsaturated fatty acids;16 however,
MSn (n > 2) was required
for the more complicated lipid classes, such as phospholipids,17 and triacylglycerols.18

The goal of the research reported herein is to provide a universal
method to detect double bond positions in unsaturated lipids. This
contribution describes a simple, new approach, surface oxidation under
ambient air; the method provides an efficient, high throughput, convenient,
and economical way to identify double bond positions in lipids; it
requires neither sample derivatization nor any special MS instrument
modification to detect unsaturation sites. In this study, lipid oxidation
was determined by using liquid extraction surface analysis (LESA)
coupled to an ESI quadrupole orthogonal time-of-flight (Q-o-TOF) MS,
after unsaturated lipids were deposited onto several different surfaces
and exposed to ambient air for 1 or 24 h. TLC-MS was applied to separate
complex lipid mixtures and to elucidate the structures of the lipids
and their oxidized products.

Experimental Section
Materials
Sulfatide (ST) standards (d18:1/C24:1 and
d18:1/C24:0) and bovine brain total lipid extract were obtained from
Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Octadecanoic acid (stearic
acid, C18:0), 9Z-octadecenoic acid (oleic acid, C18:1
(9Z)), 9Z,12Z-octadecadienoic
acid (linoleic acid, C18:2 (9Z,12Z)), tetracosanoic acid (lignoceric acid, C24:0), 15Z-tetracosenoic acid (nervonic acid, C24:1 (15Z)),

Protocols
we have developed
for use of the LESA device (Advion BioSciences, Inc., Ithaca, NY)
for lipid MS and MS/MS analyses are described elsewhere.19 For details, see Supporting
Information.

Sample Preparation for Nanospray ESI-MS
Twenty picomoles
of STs phosphatidylcholines and fatty acids in CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1, v/v) were deposited on aluminum- or glass-backed
silica gel TLC plates, microscope glass slides, and aluminum foils.
After exposure to the air for 0, 1, or 24 h, the samples were extracted
using 10 μL of (CH3)2CHOH/CH3OH/H2O (9:1:1, v/v/v) and were analyzed using the nanoESI
source of the QSTAR Pulsar i Q-o-TOF MS fitted with
the TriVersa NanoMate.

Square pieces cut from aluminum foil
(1 cm × 1 cm) were placed in a nitrogen-purged three-necked flask
that had been half-filled with glass beads to provide a level surface.
STs were applied to the substrate through a septum and dried with
a nitrogen purge. At each time point, 10 μL of (CH3)2CHOH/CH3OH/H2O (9:1:1, v/v/v)
was applied to the substrate to dissolve the lipid samples and the
resulting solution was collected into an amber glass vial for analysis.

Twenty picomoles of the STs were deposited on pieces of aluminum
foil (1 cm × 1 cm) and these were placed in a darkroom. STs were
manually extracted by 10 μL of (CH3)2CHOH/CH3OH/H2O (9:1:1, v/v/v) and saved for analysis by
nanoESI-MS at different time periods. Ozonide formation was confirmed
by analyzing the samples after treatment under an ozone-saturated
atmosphere. For this procedure, the ST samples on aluminum foil were
placed in a 24-well plate and the plate was placed in an airtight
container. After the container was purged with ozone-saturated air
generated from a corona discharger (Model BD-20 V, Electro-Technic
Products, Inc., Chicago, IL) for 10 min, the container was hermetically
sealed to keep the samples in it under an ozone-saturated atmosphere
for 24 h.

Ultra high-mass resolution spectra were acquired for
nervonic acid
with a 12-T SolariX (Bruker Daltonics Inc., Billerica, MA, USA) fitted
with a modified Bruker nanoESI source, following deposition of the
lipid onto aluminum foil and exposure to ozone for 0, 1, or 24 h.
With this FTMS system, the mass accuracy was better than 1 ppm.

Characterization of Surface Roughness
The samples were
characterized using white light interferometry, contact stylus interferometry
and scanning electron microscopy. For details, see Supporting Information.

Results and Discussion
Observation
of Lipid Surface Oxidation on TLC Plate
Consistent with the
results reported by the Blanksby group using
DESI MS8 and those we describe elsewhere,19 oxidation products were observed during direct-sampling
TLC-ESI-MS of STs. Following deposition of 100 pmol of d18:1/C24:1
ST, the silica gel-coated TLC plate was developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/0.2% CaCl2 (55:45:10, v/v/v), then exposed
to ambient air and the bands were analyzed by ESI-MS.

In addition
to the expected [M – H]− at m/z 888.62, signals corresponding to larger species
were observed at m/z 936.61 (+48
u) and 984.59 (+96 u). Peaks indicative of a degraded species appeared
at m/z 778.48 (−110 u); this
product apparently underwent a further loss of 180 u to generate the
species observed at m/z 598.25.
Assignments of these modified peaks were made on the basis of subsequent
CID experiments (Supporting Information Figure S-1). The pathways are summarized in Figure 1c.

A similar ion series was observed for the reaction
products of
d18:1/C24:0 ST, which has one double bond on the sphingoid backbone
chain and a saturated fatty acyl chain (Figure 1d). The [M – H]− was at m/z 890.64; the peak at m/z 938.62 indicated a component with an increase of 48 u
and m/z 710.42 corresponded to [M
– H]− for a species that arose by loss of
180 u from the one detected at m/z 890.64 (Figure 1b).

In CID MS/MS, all
the above ions yielded ST-characteristic headgroup
fragments at m/z 96.96, 241.00,
and 259.01 (Supporting Information Figure
S-1a). The ion at m/z 778.48 could
be assigned as the oxidatively cleaved product bearing a terminal
aldehyde at carbon-15 on the former fatty acyl chain of d18:1/C24:1
ST, and the ion at m/z 598.25 corresponded
to the dialdehyde formed following the oxidative cleavage of the double
bonds on both its fatty acyl chain and long chain base (LCB) (Supporting Information Figure S-1b). Evidence
was found for oxidative cleavage of d18:1/C24:0 ST that has no fatty
acyl double bond. Oxidation generated only one aldehyde group, at
carbon-4 of its LCB, and the product was detected at m/z 710.42 (Supporting Information Figure S-1c). The ozonides were fairly stable (Figure 1c and d), consistent with previous reports.8,20 The
[M – H]− ions observed at m/z 936.61 and 984.59, in the spectra of the ozonolysis
products from d18:1/C24:1 ST, and m/z 938.62, from d18:1/C24:0 ST (Figure 1), could
be assigned as ozonides formed on the double bond positions (Supporting Information Figure S-1d, e, and f)
of these lipids. The signal at m/z 984.59 had low S/N in this TLC-MS
experiment. CID decomposed all these ozonides to yield aldehyde and
carboxylic acid fragments via initial homolytic cleavage of the peroxide
bridge of the trioxolane followed by rearrangement.21 Ion signals at m/z 778.48
and 794.47 corresponded to the aldehyde and carboxylic acid products
formed upon oxidation of the Δ15,16 double bond in the fatty
acyl chain of d18:1/C24:1 ST (reaction at the lone double bond generated
the ozonide at m/z 936.61). Observation
of these two product ions confirmed that the ozonide was formed on
the fatty acyl group but not along the LCB; otherwise, product ions
at m/z 708.41 and 724.40 would also
have been detected. Therefore, it became clear that the oxidation
occurred at the double bond in the fatty acyl chain preferentially
over the LCB. In contrast, in the CID MS/MS spectrum of m/z 938.62, the presence of product ions at m/z 710.42 and 726.41 indicated that an
aldehyde and a carboxylic acid formed in the LCB at the Δ4,5
position of d18:1/C24:0 ST. Additionally, the presence of the hydroxyl
group on the sphingoid backbone directed formation of other CID product
ions. For instance, the precursor ion at m/z 938.62 provided the product ion at m/z 680.40, which results from secondary loss of 30 u (e.g.,
CH2O, formaldehyde) from the component observed at m/z 710.42. The m/z 680.40 peak thus represents the aldehyde formed with cleavage
at the Δ4,5 site on the sphingoid backbone. Meanwhile, the precursor
ion at m/z 984.59 corresponds to
the fully ozonized d18:1/C24:1 ST; this generated a more complicated
MS/MS spectrum. In addition to the cleavages at the trioxolane moiety
(m/z 826.46, 842.46, 598.25, and
614.25), cleavage at the position one carbon further along the sphingosine
chain formed an aldehyde at carbon-3, generating the ion at m/z 584.24 and its dehydration product
detected at m/z 568.24. As noted
above, the mass accuracy was within 15 ppm for all QStar experiments.

The discovery introduced above
by direct sampling TLC-ESI MS could
have many origins: the experimental processes of TLC, exposure during
TLC in the air, sampling by the TLC-MS interface (LESA NanoMate),
and nanoESI MS. Since signals were observed only at values corresponding
to the [M – H]− ions predicted for the unmodified
species when solutions of ST standards were directly introduced by
nanospray into the MS (data not shown), it immediately seemed clear
that nanoESI-MS itself is not the driver for the oxidation reaction.

To investigate the remaining factors that might be responsible
for the lipid oxidation, we performed experiments on other surfaces:
aluminum foil, glass slides, glass-backed TLC plates from two different
manufacturers, and also aluminum-backed TLC plates without development.
In the experiments whose results are shown in Figure 2, 100 pmol of d18:1/C24:1 and d18:1/C24:0 STs were deposited
on these different surfaces and the products were analyzed using TLC-ESI-MS
with a LESA TLC-MS interface. Analysis of a sulfatide (d18:1/C24:1)
deposited on an aluminum-backed TLC plate showed different spectra
over the analysis time (Figure 2a-1). The molecular
ion at m/z 888.62 and ions at m/z 598.25, 778.48, 936.61, and 984.59
were observed after 1-h exposure to ambient air. After 24 h, all ions
disappeared except for the ion at m/z 598.25. For d18:1/C24:0 ST, the spectrum from the 1-h treated sample
showed ions at m/z 710.42 and 938.62.
Similarly, after 24-h exposure, the abundance of the ion at m/z 710.42 increased with respect to that
of the intact ST molecular ion (Figure 2a-2).
STs deposited on the glass-backed TLC plate underwent changes similar
to those on the aluminum-backed TLC plate (data not shown). The same
pattern of results was obtained with a glass-backed TLC plate from
a different manufacturer (data not shown). As shown in Figure 2b, both d18:1/C24:1 and d18:1/C24:0 ST were oxidized
somewhat more slowly on aluminum foil than when deposited on an aluminum-backed
TLC plate. In the spectrum of d18:1/C24:1 ST, the component detected
at m/z 598.25 was attributed to
loss of 180 u from the species with [M – H]−m/z 778.48. The relative abundance
of the peak at m/z 598.25 was increased
in comparison to that of the ion at m/z 778.48 in the spectrum of the sample on the TLC surface versus aluminum
foil, for either 1 or 24 h (Figure 2b-1). Additionally,
the oxidation products observed in the spectrum from the 1-h sample
deposited on the TLC plate were similar to those found for the 24-h
sample on aluminum foil. In the spectrum of the sample left for 24
h on the TLC plate, additional oxidation products were observed. For
d18:1/C24:0 ST, the intensity ratio of the signal at m/z 710.42 to that at m/z 890.64 in the spectra collected at the same time point
was much higher for samples deposited on TLC plates than for those
that were deposited on aluminum foil (Figure 2b-2). The spectra shown in Figure 2c, indicate
that the oxidation reactions on glass slides occurred more slowly
than those on all other surfaces tested in this study. For d18:1/C24:0
ST, at least 3 days were required to observe the oxidation product
at m/z 710.42 for samples deposited
on glass slides. Therefore, these observations led to the conclusion
that the order of oxidation reaction rates on the examined surfaces
is silica gel TLC > aluminum foil ≫ glass slide.

The
surface roughness was tested for these three materials. The
average roughness, Ra, for silica gel TLC (∼606 nm) was slightly
larger than that for aluminum foil (ca. 390 nm),
and was much larger than that for the glass slide (∼3 nm) (Supporting Information Figure S-2). Rough surfaces
provide increased contact area for the ambient air, and thus may be
expected to cause oxidative cleavage reactions to take place more
rapidly. Meanwhile, the mass spectra recorded for the samples treated
on aluminum foil and glass slides were much cleaner than those obtained
for the sample deposited on the TLC plate, and this improvement in
spectral quality made it possible to detect the diozonide product
of d18:1/C24:1 ST at m/z 984.59.
On the basis of the spectra obtained from the samples treated on different
surfaces, it should be noted that there was no evidence in the mass
spectra to indicate that the ozonide had decomposed to the aldehyde.
It is noteworthy that the spectra became more complicated after 1
day; new signals appeared, in addition to those that could be attributed
to “aldehyde, carboxyl acid and ozonide”. This result
warrants further investigation.

Figure 2 Negative-ion mode ESI-MS spectra acquired
following deposition
of d18:1/C24:1 ST (1) and d18:1/C24:0 ST (2) onto different surfaces,
silica gel TLC plate (a), aluminum foil (b), and glass slide (c),
and exposure to ambient air for 0, 1 h, and 1 day prior to analysis.
Oxidation products are labeled with an asterisk (*).

As discussed previously, d18:1/C24:1 ST generated
an oxidation
product that was detected at m/z 778.48 (from cleavage on the fatty acyl chain) and then produced
an ion at m/z 598.25 (by cleavage
of the double bonds in both the fatty acyl chain and the LCB). It
is notable that there was no signal that would correspond to a fragment
generated by cleavage solely on the LCB of d18:1/C24:1 ST and the
disappearance of intact d18:1/C24:0 ST occurred much more slowly than
d18:1/C24:1 ST, especially when the sulfatides were coated on glass
slides (Figure 2c). These pieces of evidence
suggest that the reaction rate for ST surface oxidation of the double
bond on the fatty acyl chain is faster than the rate of oxidation
on the LCB, at the site of unsaturation that has an adjacent hydroxyl
group. The presence of the α-hydroxyl group evidently reduces
the susceptibility of the double bond on the sphingoid backbone to
oxidation.

The data presented above provide evidence that the
oxidation occurs
not only on the TLC plate, but also on other surfaces. To elucidate
which element is critical for the oxidation, STs were deposited on
aluminum foil, exposed under ambient air for different time periods
and manually extracted. Extracted lipid samples were analyzed by nanoESI-MS
performed with a TriVersa NanoMate and showed the same pattern of
results as the data collected by LESA-MS for samples deposited on
aluminum foil (data not shown). This suggests that the LESA NanoMate
interface is not necessary for oxidation of an unsaturated lipid.
The results do indicate that surface exposure to ambient air is critical
for the lipid double bond oxidation.

Interestingly, after TLC
development, the oxidation products of
ST with shorter fatty acyl substituents or truncated LCBs were not
observed in any position on the TLC plate below that of the intact
STs with higher polarity. This result indicates that the STs were
not oxidized prior to or during the TLC development. The TLC developing
tank was saturated with the developing solvent vapor and this may
have protected the unsaturated lipids embedded in the TLC gel from
the ambient air. However, after development, during the time period
utilized for drying, staining, and marking the spots of interest in
the analytical TLC plate by pencil, the separated components were
exposed to the ambient laboratory environment. During this time, the
analytes must have undergone oxidation and formed oxidized products
that were detected at the same migration position on the TLC plate
where the relevant intact lipids were located. The TLC separation
had been completed prior to oxidation and thus could not have separated
the long chain ST from the truncated shorter chain STs. This phenomenon
also suggests that the oxidation is caused by postdevelopment exposure
of unsaturated lipids to ambient air.

Mechanism Study
Ambient ozone had been proposed as
the reagent responsible for oxidation of unsaturated lipids and peptides
that were air-dried prior to analysis by MALDI-MS, nanoassisted laser
desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (NALDI-MS) and DESI-MS.8,22−24 Once we had determined that rate of the oxidation
reaction was considerably faster on aluminum foil, it seemed easier
to explore the oxidation mechanisms using aluminum foil rather than
a glass slide. Aluminum foil also reduced the “chemical noise”
background compared to TLC. Therefore, in subsequent experiments,
we deposited 100 pmol of ST on aluminum foil under the “ozone”
conditions (Supporting Information Figure
S-3). After 24-h exposure to generated ozone, we detected only a small
amount of ozonide (m/z 936.61) and
no aldehyde (m/z 778.48) of d18:1/C24:1
ST by nanoESI-MS using the TriVersa NanoMate (Supporting Information Figure S-3a) for sampling. However,
the MS spectrum recorded after 24-h exposure under ozone (Supporting Information Figure S-3b) showed no
evidence for aldehyde (m/z 710.42)
or ozonide (m/z 938.62) derived
from the d18:1/C24:0 ST. The signal intensity from ozonide product
of ST generated under the ozone environment was much lower than that
recorded for the experiment performed under ambient air (as shown
in Figure 2b) over the same time period. This
result was consistent with the report that the amount of ozonides
observed under ambient air was larger than that observed under the
gas phase conditions of OzID.8 However,
the results of our investigation suggest that the outcome does not
depend on stabilization of the ozone adduct on the surface.23 It rather seems that the generated ozone somehow
protects the unsaturated lipids from the ambient air on the surface.
In addition, as we demonstrated with Figure 2, there was no evidence to indicate that the aldehyde was derived
from the ozonide by decomposition during the air exposure process,
though it appeared as a fragment of ozonide in the CID spectra. The
aldehyde was generated earlier and ozonides were produced later in
the course of lipid oxidation. Therefore, it seems that, in addition
to ozone oxidation, there must be another oxidation mechanism that
is deeply involved in the lipid double bond surface oxidation.

To elucidate the key role of ambient air in the observed lipid oxidation,
gaseous nitrogen (N2) was used as protective environment
(Supporting Information Figure S-4). The
oxidation was totally inhibited by the protection of the sample by
N2 after standard deposition of ST onto the aluminum foil.
Even after 24 h under N2, neither d18:1/C24:1 nor d18:1/C24:0
ST generated any oxidative product. As a result, we could conclude
that environmental air is required to oxidize the double bonds of
lipids dried on the surfaces.

Since light has been considered
to be involved in lipid oxidation
by singlet oxygen in other cases, STs were deposited on aluminum foil
and placed in the darkroom and spectra were collected over time. While
kept in the dark, the substrates were protected from oxidation, despite
there being sufficient airflow. No oxidation product was detected
by nanoESI-MS with the TriVersa NanoMate after 24 h (Supporting Information Figure S-5). The data shown here provide
evidence that oxidation of the unsaturated lipid surface is a light-sensitive
reaction.

It has been strongly suggested that singlet oxygen
(1O2) was formed by photosensitization in the
atmosphere
and may play a significant role as an oxidant in the air.25 Many researchers have pointed out that 1O2 is an important oxidizing agent present in ambient
polluted air.26−28 Since the transition from the 1Δg state to the 3Eg– state is spin forbidden, the 1Δg O2 is considerably long-lived. It had been confirmed that the
radiative lifetime of O2 (1Δg) is 45 min in the gas phase29 and 10–6 - 10–3 s in solution.30 This difference in the lifetime of singlet oxygen
under the two conditions explains why oxidation of unsaturated lipids
could only be observed on surfaces exposed to the air but not in solution.
Singlet oxygen is significantly electrophilic, and reacts with unsaturated
carbon–carbon bonds, neutral nucleophiles, and anions.31 Scheme 1 shows the proposed
mechanism of the double bond oxidation by 1O2.32 The nucleophilic oxygen from the allylic
hydroxyl group on carbon in the position α to the double bond
enables the lipid to interact with the electrophilic 1O2, thereby directing the attack of this enophile.33 Resonance is not possible for the allylic hydroxyl
group and the carbon–carbon double bond. Therefore, the hydroxyl
group cannot participate in delocalization of π-electrons or
function as an electron donor. In contrast, the hydroxyl oxygen is
electron withdrawing by induction (−I) because
the oxygen atom is relatively electronegative and is uncharged in
that bonding arrangement. The “–I”
effect makes the double bond less electron-rich and thus a poorer
nucleophile than the carbon–carbon double bond without the
allylic hydroxyl group. This consideration can explain why the double
bond in the sphingoid backbone reacts more slowly than that in the
fatty acyl chain.

Scheme 1 Proposed Mechanism for Carbon–Carbon Double
Bond Oxidation
by Singlet Oxygen
Ozone is also a source of singlet oxygen because of photolysis
of ozone in the Hartley region (3200 to 2000 Å).25 Singlet oxygen could act as a secondary oxidant by the
reaction of ozone. The ethylene consumption rate constant of singlet
oxygen is much greater than that of ozone.34 Consideration that the ozone concentration is higher than the concentration
of singlet oxygen could explain the observation that the aldehyde
generation starts earlier and ozonides are produced later in the course
of lipid oxidation. The results obtained in Supporting
Information Figure S-3, suggest that the presence of ozone
somehow protected the unsaturated lipids from the ambient air on the
surface. This result is consistent with the observation of Ellis et
al.8 that ozonolysis was not observed when
the samples were protected from airflow within a box containing a
low concentration of ozone that was likely adsorbed by the surfaces
of the box. Therefore, we propose that the reaction of singlet oxygen
and ozone oxidation are two parallel reactions leading to double bond
surface oxidation in unsaturated lipids.

Meanwhile, surface
oxidation of phospholipids with poly unsaturated
fatty acyl groups was investigated in this study. Phosphatidylcholine
(16:0/18:1(9Z)) and phosphatidylcholine (16:0/18:2(9Z,12Z)) were compared after exposure to the ambient air
(Supporting Information Figure S-6). Aldehyde
formation was found in phosphatidylcholine (16:0/18:1(9Z)) at the isolated double-bond position (Supporting
Information Figure S-6a) and two aldehyde products were detected
in phosphatidylcholine (16:0/18:2(9Z,12Z)) at either
of its double bond positions (Supporting Information Figure S-6b). With the presence of two aldehyde products, the existence
of two carbon–carbon double bonds and their positions can be
established.

Analysis of Free Fatty Acids and Bovine Brain
Total Lipid Extract
by TLC-ESI-MS
The direct sampling TLC-ESI-MS method for polar
lipid analysis using the LESA TLC-MS interface recently developed
by our group19 was applied to the analysis
of free fatty acids and to a bovine brain total lipid extract. Herein,
we present relevant mass spectra and discuss the identification of
the double bond positions by analysis of TLC-MS data obtained for
the oxidized products of the bovine brain lipid extract. Because of
space limitations, the data obtained for the free fatty acids and
discussion of these results are included in the Supporting Information.

The bovine brain total lipids
were deposited on a normal phase silica gel TLC plate and their separation
was primarily based on the differences in their polarity. After development,
the TLC plate reserved for MS analysis was dried under ambient air.
It was aligned with the primuline-stained TLC plate, marked with pencil
to indicate the lipid locations, and cut to fit in the LESA holder.
The total time for exposure to the air was about 0.5 h. Figure 3 shows LESA-TLC-ESI mass spectra obtained from TLC
plate areas where the intensities of signals that correspond to phosphatidylserine
(PS) and N,N-dimethyl phosphatidylethanolamine
(PE-NMe2) candidates were the greatest. In Figure 3a, the most abundant peak (m/z 788.54) corresponded to the [M – H]− of PS (18:0/18:1), and could be assigned to this structure on the
basis of its CID MS/MS spectrum. (Supporting Information Figure S-7a) The CID spectrum of the second most abundant signal
(m/z 678.40) corresponded to the
PS aldehyde that would have been formed by oxidation of the Δ9,10
double bond, in the PS that had a fatty acyl chain of 18:0, PS (18:0/9:1[O])
(Supporting Information Figure S-7b). Interestingly,
an ion at m/z 591.37 that could
be assigned as a PA aldehyde (18:0/9:1[O]) was found at the same retention
factor (Rf) value; this assignment was
confirmed by analysis of the corresponding PA standard (data not shown).
Under exposure to the air, the PS lipid class reacted to form PS oxidation
products and also PA oxidation products. The ion at m/z 706.43 corresponds to the expected aldehyde formed
following the oxidation of the Δ11,12 double bond of the isomeric
PS (18:0/18:1, Δ11,12) (Supporting Information Figure S-7d). Fatty acids 18:1 (Δ9,10) and 18:1, (Δ11,12)
are common in nature and their presence in the mixture can explain
the observations of PS (18:0/18:1, Δ9,10)17 and PS (18:0/18:1, Δ11,12). Other ions in the spectrum
shown in Figure 3a corresponded to other less
abundant PSs and their potential oxidation products.

Figure 3b shows the direct sampling LESA-TLC-MS
spectrum from the PE-NMe2 candidate spot on a silica gel
TLC plate. The ion at m/z 744.55
corresponds to PE-NMe2 (16:0/18:1), while m/z 746.57 corresponds to the molecular ion of PE-NMe2 (16:0/18:0). The structural assignments for both ions were
confirmed by their CID spectra (Supporting Information Figure S-8a and b). The neutral loss of 71 Da, the signal at m/z 224.07 and other phosphate fragment
ions are signatures that were used to identify the assignments of
the PE-NMe2 molecular ion. Oxidation products were observed
at m/z 634.41 and 662.44. The ion
at m/z 634.41 in the CID MS/MS spectrum
corresponded to PE-NMe2 aldehyde (16:0/9:1[O]) that was
cleaved within the Δ9,10 double bond (Supporting
Information Figure S-8c). The signal at m/z 662.44 was determined to be a mixture of the [M –
H]− species from the PE-NMe2 aldehyde
(16:0/11:1[O]) and PE-NMe2 aldehyde (18:0/9:1[O]) (Supporting Information Figure S-8d). The presence
of both PE-NMe2 aldehydes (16:0/9:1[O]) and (16:0/11:1[O])
indicates that PE-NMe2 (16:0/18:1) exists as a mixture
of isomers of PE-NMe2 (16:0/18:1, Δ9,10) and (16:0/18:1,
Δ11,12). The peak at m/z 772.59
that could have provided evidence for the presence of PE-NMe2 (18:0/18:1) had lower S/N (Figure 3b); its signal intensity was not sufficient for
an MS/MS experiment. It is significant that there were a few higher
abundance peaks in the spectrum shown in Figure 3b, such as m/z 818.58, 846.62,
708.45, and 736.48. Their CID spectra showed a common 74-u neutral
loss to yield fragments at m/z 744.55,
772.59, 634.41, and 662.44 respectively, which would correspond to
expected values for a series of the PE-NMe2 lipids and
their oxidized products. After the initial 74-u neutral loss from
the molecular ions, the tandem MS spectra matched well for each precursor/primary
fragment ion pair (m/z 818.58/744.55, m/z 708.45/634.41, m/z 736.48/662.44). The MS/MS spectrum of m/z 846.62 indicated it was a mixture of PE-NMe2 (18:0/18:1) and (16:0/20:1) with an additional 74 u (Supporting Information Figure S-8e). Combined
with the oxidative product data, this result suggests that PE-NMe2 (18:0/18:1, Δ9,10), (16:0/20:1, Δ9,10) and (16:0/20:1,
Δ11,12) were present in the sample as natural or artifactual
species containing glyceryl esters on the phosphate group. The 74-u
neutral loss corresponds to elimination of dehydroglycerol (C3H6O2).

Figure 3 TLC-MS negative-ion mode spectra acquired
following separation
of the bovine brain total lipid extract. (a) PS (18:0/18:1) at m/z 788.54 and its oxidation products.
(b) PE-NMe2 (16:0/18:1) m/z 744.55, PE-NMe2 (16:0/18:0) m/z 746.57, and PE-NMe2 (18:0/18:1) m/z 772.59, plus oxidation products and adducts.
Oxidation products indicating the unsaturation Δ9,10 are labeled
with (*) and those indicating the unsaturation Δ11,12 are labeled
with a black square (■). The easily dissociated [M + C3H6O2 – H]− peaks
at m/z 818 and 846 correspond to
glyceryl esters or adducts.

It was notable that, at first, no oxidation products were
observed
for STs in the bovine brain total lipid extract by LESA-TLC-MS. However,
when developed TLC plates were exposed to ambient air and light over
longer time (more than 3 days), the corresponding aldehydes could
be observed (data not shown). This observation might be explained
by the presence of antioxidant components such as lipid-soluble vitamin
E that coexists in the bovine brain. PEs that colocalized with STs
on the TLC plate in this investigation showed phenomena similar to
the STs, which supports the “position-related” protection
theory.

A better TLC separation would provide a better opportunity
for
location of double bond positions on unsaturated lipids. Thus, 2-D
TLC would be an ideal candidate to improve the separation of colocalized
lipids.

Conclusions
The behaviors of various
lipid classes were examined in this investigation.
Surface oxidation under ambient air modified all categories of unsaturated
lipids that were tested: fatty acids, GSLs, and phospholipids. The
oxidation rates and products were found to be dependent on the types
of double bonds. If an allylic hydroxyl group was present, its reaction
rate was slower.

According to our study and the reports of others,
surface oxidation
in unsaturated lipids under ambient air occurs on a variety of surface
materials. Moreover, we have found that the reaction rates differ,
even for individual surface materials, based on their roughness. These
data also indicate that both ozone oxidation and a second type of
reaction occur. We propose a mechanism involving singlet oxygen, which
is widely considered as an oxidant for lipid oxidation both in vivo
and in vitro. When combined with the ozonolysis theory, our singlet
oxygen mechanism can fully explain the phenomena observed in unsaturated
lipids.

On the basis of our findings, extra care is needed in
general lipid
processing procedures. Liquid–liquid extraction is found to
be safe for the unsaturated lipids becaue of the extremely low oxidation
rates for singlet oxygen in solution. However, attention is needed
for the lipids extracted from TLC plates, especially for studies that
investigate oxidized lipids in biological samples. Artifactual oxidation
may occur due to the ambient air exposure.

Surface oxidation
under ambient air provides an efficient, convenient
and economical way to identify double bond positions in unsaturated
lipids. Surface oxidation does not require any special type of instrumentation
to oxidize the unsaturated lipid. If the sample is reasonably pure,
direct infusion supplemented by surface exposure on aluminum foil
under ambient air for 1 h and liquid re-extraction are sufficient
to elucidate the double bond positions within fatty acyl chains. For
analysis of complex biological samples, TLC-MS is able to separate
and analyze the components and their oxidation products, even those
that are present at the same Rf value.
In this investigation, LESA-TLC-ESI-MS was applied; TLC-MALDI-MS would
also suitable. Therefore, our method could be used widely with almost
any type of MS instrument to identify the location of double bonds
in unsaturated lipids.
