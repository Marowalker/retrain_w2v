An autonomous metabolomic workflow
combining mass spectrometry
analysis with tandem mass spectrometry data acquisition was designed
to allow for simultaneous data processing and metabolite characterization.
Although previously tandem mass spectrometry data have been generated
on the fly, the experiments described herein combine this technology
with the bioinformatic resources of XCMS and METLIN. As a result of
this unique integration, we can analyze large profiling datasets and
simultaneously obtain structural identifications. Validation of the
workflow on bacterial samples allowed the profiling on the order of
a thousand metabolite features with simultaneous tandem mass spectra
data acquisition. The tandem mass spectrometry data acquisition enabled
automatic search and matching against the METLIN tandem mass spectrometry
database, shortening the current workflow from days to hours. Overall,
the autonomous approach to untargeted metabolomics provides an efficient
means of metabolomic profiling, and will ultimately allow the more
rapid integration of comparative analyses, metabolite identification,
and data analysis at a systems biology level.

Untargeted
metabolomic experiments
performed on complex biological matrices with high-resolution, high-throughput,
and sensitive mass spectrometry (MS) technology have enabled the detection
of thousands of metabolite features from a single experiment.1−4 However, the identification of these features presents a major bottleneck
in the metabolomics workflow. It is not only a time-consuming process,
taking weeks to carry out, but often results in a low yield of correctly
identified metabolites. This is partly due to the manual interpretation
required by the investigator and also the number of metabolites currently
characterized in metabolite databases.5 This process can be potentially shortened by integrating metabolite
profiling and identification into a single autonomous workflow.

Current metabolomic studies typically adopt a multistep workflow
(Figure 1). Comparative profiling is first
carried out in MS mode; the data is then processed using bioinformatics
software such as XCMS6,7 to reveal features of interest
that show statistically significant differences. The features are
then subjected to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) acquisition and
identified through MS/MS matching to standards in metabolite databases
such as METLIN.8,9 This conventional approach typically
involves the generation of a list of dysregulated metabolite features
from an initial set of experiments followed by statistical analysis
and manual selection of precursor ions, which are then fragmented
to obtain mass spectra used for metabolite characterization.10 Similar to the early days of proteomics, this
time-consuming metabolomic workflow relies heavily on investigator
input and manual data analysis.

To facilitate a more efficient
and autonomous approach toward ‘omic
scale profiling, we have been developing XCMS Online, a software package
for untargeted metabolomics to enable the integration of metabolite
profiling and identification into one step (Figure 1). XCMS Online has integrated algorithms for peak detection,
retention time correction, chromatogram alignment, and relative quantification
based on peak area. In addition, a number of univariate and multivariate
statistical tools have been incorporated into the workflow to aid
in elucidating the features that have the highest statistical significance
and drive sample clustering.11 However,
one of the most important aspects of XCMS Online is its integrated
metabolite database, METLIN, a spectral library with MS/MS data available
for more than ten thousand endogenous and exogenous metabolites, enabling
automatic putative identification of metabolites.

Figure 1 An autonomous vs conventional
mass spectrometry-based metabolomic
workflow. The autonomous workflow is based on parallel untargeted
MS1 and MS2 data acquisition, where cycle time
is optimized as a compromise for high peak definition (MS1 for comparative quantitative analysis) and high quality MS2 (for MS/MS matching to facilitate metabolite identification). The
conventional workflow, the untargeted MS1 data acquisition
for comparative quantitative analysis and targeted MS2 data
acquisition of dysregulated features of interest (for metabolite identification)
are performed in two subsequent steps. The autonomous workflow can
be accomplished through the direct link between XCMS software and
METLIN metabolite database.

The basis of the autonomous metabolomic workflow is high
resolution
sequential MS and MS/MS data acquisition (Figure 1). High-quality MS and MS/MS data are a prerequisite to extract
accurate quantitative information and simultaneously characterize
metabolite features by MS/MS data matching.13 This one-step autonomous approach requires coordinated acquisition
of MS and MS/MS data to ensure efficient and accurate comparative
analysis and identification. Mass spectrometers that have high scan
speeds and can alternate between MS and MS/MS modes in the same run
are essential for this type of simultaneous data acquisition. Indeed,
most modern quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) instruments have high
sensitivity and rapid scan speeds ensuring the acquisition of a sufficient
amount of data points across a chromatographic peak while simultaneously
acquiring fragmentation data which is necessary for metabolite characterization.

Key to the autonomous approach has been the development, over the
last ten years, of databases to facilitate identification of metabolites
in metabolomic experiments. The METLIN tandem mass spectrometry database,14,15 Human Metabolome Database (HMDB),16 MassBank,17 and LipidMaps18 databases
have been generated largely from the analysis of pure standard compounds
to provide for accurate identification of metabolites from biological
samples. Most of these repositories allow researchers to compare MS/MS
data from their research samples to MS/MS data recorded from standards
one at a time for metabolite identification.

Here, we have designed
an autonomous untargeted metabolomic workflow
that acquires MS and MS/MS data sequentially. Quantitative information
is extracted from MS data using XCMS Online and metabolite features
are simultaneously characterized by matching MS/MS data to the METLIN
database. The effectiveness of this workflow is demonstrated using
standard mixture and a bacterial extract samples.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
Ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) and ammonium
hydroxide (NH4OH) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO, USA). LC-MS grade methanol (MeOH) was purchased from Honeywell
(Muskegon, MI, USA). LC-MS grade acetonitrile was purchased from Fisher
Scientific (Morris Plains, NJ, USA) and water was purchased from J.T.
Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ, USA).

Bacterial Strain and Biofilm
Growth Conditions
Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DvH) was obtained
from Dr. Romy Chakraborty (Lawrence Berkeley National Lab). DvH was
grown in LS4D medium, which contains lactate as the carbon source
and electron donor and sulfate as the electron acceptor19 (modified to 2.5 μM resazurin and 130
μM riboflavin in modified Thauer’s vitamins stock).20 Lactate and sulfate concentrations were altered
to create balanced and electron acceptor limited conditions. The balanced
condition was defined as 60 mM sodium lactate and 30 mM sodium sulfate
and the electron acceptor limited condition was defined as 50 mM sodium
lactate and 10 mM sodium sulfate. DvH was grown as a biofilm under
continuous flow conditions in a modified CDC reactor. Exponential
phase cells were inoculated into a reactor containing balanced or
electron acceptor limited LS4D medium and were grown in batch mode
for 48 h. Reactors were grown at room temperature (20–23 °C),
with a dilution rate of 0.04–hr, stirred at 60 rpm,
and the headspace was continually sparged with sterile N2 gas to maintain anaerobic conditions. Coupons of aclar (7.8 mil
thickness) (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) supported
by glass slides were submerged in the reactor body as a surface for
biofilm growth. Aclar coupons were removed from the reactor at 144
h, rinsed three times in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline, wicked
dry, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at −70
°C until further analysis.

Growth of Credentialed Escherichia coli Standards
Escherichia
coli cultures were grown in a rotary
shaker at 37 °C. A preculture of K12 MG1655 strain was grown
in LB broth for 16 h. M9 minimal salts were prepared and 100 mL aliquoted
into 2 sterile 1 L Erlenmeyer flasks. To each aliquot 2 mL of 200
mg/mL glucose was added via fresh filtered syringe. One aliquot received
U13C-labeled glucose and the second received natural abundance
glucose. Each aliquot was then inoculated with the equivalent of 1
mL of OD600 = 0.6 preculture as determined by dilution. Cultures were
grown to OD600 = 1.0 at which point they were harvested. Cell quench
solution of 10 mM ammonium acetate in 3:2 methanol/water was aliquoted
into 50 conical tubes, 30 mL per tube. Tubes were chilled to −60
°C using a dry ice and 60% ethylene glycol in ethanol bath. Upon
reaching OD600 = 1.0 flasks were removed from the shaker and rapidly
aliquoted into the prechilled tubes. Pairs of tubes were prepared,
with one being mixed at 8:11 and the other 11:8 12C culture
to 13C culture, respectively. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation
at 0 °C and 3200 RCF for 15 min.

Metabolite Extraction
Bacteria biofilm and cell pellets
(DVH and E. coli) were extracted using a MeOH/ACN/H2O (2:2:1, v/v) solvent mixture. A volume of 1 mL of cold solvent
was added to each pellet, vortexed for 30 s and incubated in liquid
nitrogen for 1 min. Samples were allowed to thaw and sonicated for
10 min. This cycle of cell lysis in liquid nitrogen combined with
sonication was repeated three times. To precipitate proteins, the
samples were incubated for 1 h at −20 °C, followed by
15 min centrifugation at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C. The resulting supernatant
was removed and evaporated to dryness in a vacuum concentrator. The
dry extracts were then reconstituted in 100 μL of ACN:H2O (1:1, v/v), sonicated for 10 min and centrifuged for 15
min at 13000 rpm and 4 °C to remove insoluble debris. The supernatants
were transferred to HPLC vials and stored at −80 °C prior
to LC/MS analysis.

LC/MS/MS Analysis
Analyses were
performed using an
HPLC system (1200 series, Agilent Technologies) coupled to a quadrupole
time-of-flight (AB Sciex TripleTOF 5600, and Agilent Q-TOF 6530).
Samples were analyzed using a Phenomenex (Torrance, CA, USA) Luna
Aminopropyl column for HILIC-MS analysis.21 The mobile phase A = 20 mM NH4Ac and 20 mM NH4OH in 95% water and B = 95% acetonitrile was used. A linear gradient
elution from 100% B (0–5 min) to 100% A (45–50 min)
was used. The 10 min postrun was applied to ensure column re-equilibration
and maintain the reproducibility. The total gradient time was 60 min.
The flow rate was 50 μL/min and the sample injection volume
was 5 μL. DVH biofilm samples and standard mixture were analyzed
using AB Sciex TripleTOF 5600 instrument whereas credentialed E. coli standards were analyzed using Agilent Q-TOF 6530.

ESI source conditions on TripleTOF were set as following: Ion Source
Gas 1 (GS1) as 35, Ion Source Gas 2 (GS2) as 35, Curtain gas (CUR)
as 30, source temperature 550 °C, IonSpray Voltage Floating (ISVF)
−4500 V in negative mode. In MS only acquisition, the instrument
was set to acquire over the m/z range
50–1000 Da with TOF MS scan, and the accumulation time for
TOF MS scan was set at 0.25 s/spectra. In auto MS/MS acquisition,
the instrument was set to acquire over the m/z range 50–1000 Da for TOF MS scan and the m/z range 25–1000 for product ion
scan. The accumulation time for TOF MS scan was set at 0.25 s/spectra
and product ion scan at 0.05 s/spectra (cycle time = 1 sec). The product
ion scan is acquired using information dependent acquisition (IDA)
with high sensitivity mode selected. IDA triggers MS/MS during the
full scan experiment based on a set of criteria that the user inputs.
The unit resolution is selected for precursor ion selection, and the
collision energy (CE) was fixed at −30 V with ±15 spread.
Declustering potential (DP) was set as −100 V. IDA settings
were set as following: charge state 1 to 1, intensity 500 cps, exclude
isotopes within 4 Da, mass tolerance 10 ppm and maximum number of
candidate ions 15. The “exclude former target ions”
was set as 9 s after 2 occurrences. In IDA Advanced tab, “dynamic
background subtract” was also chosen.

ESI source settings
on Agilent 6530 instrument were as follows:
gas temp, 250 °C; gas flow, 6 L/min; nebulizer pressure, 25 psi;
sheath flow, 9 L/min; sheath temperature, 350 °C; fragmentor,
120 V; capillary, 2000 V; nozzle, 1500 V. All MS and MS/MS acquisition
settings were as listed above for TripleTOF.

Data Processing of DVH
Biofilm Samples
The raw MS data
(wiff.scan files) were converted to mzXML files using ProteoWizard
MSConvert and processed using XCMS for feature detection, retention
time correction and alignment. The parameters in XCMS were set as
follows: centWave settings for feature detection (Δ m/z = 15 ppm, minimum peak width = 10 s
and maximum peak width = 120 s) and mzwid = 0.015, minfrac = 0.5,
and bw = 5 for chromatogram alignment. After careful evaluation retention
time alignment was shown not to be required. Isotopic peaks and adducts
were detected using CAMERA.22 Paramater
ID was 12480 and the data sets are shared as public data sets ID:
1039270 (Auto MS/MS job) and 1039276 (MS Only job). Each mzXML file
was processed separately to ensure features were not missed. For each
file a global noise intensity level was calculated using the XCMS
noise function on each scan. The median from the distribution was
used as a filter to remove peak below this value in each spectrum.
The precursor was then matched to METLIN at 20 ppm accuracy. The database
currently contains MS/MS data for more than 12 000 metabolites
and 61 000 MS/MS spectra. Matches with MS/MS data were scored
using a cosine similarity metric (0–1) to the closest collision
energy in the database. Spectral mirror plots were created for conformation
of positive matches.

Data Processing of Credentialed E.
coli Standards
A pair of E. coli samples (8:11 and 11:8) were
analyzed as above in both MS1 only mode and auto MS/MS mode. These
samples were credentialed using the github pattilab/credential R package
(http://pattilab.wustl.edu/software/credential/). Parameters
used were mixed_ratio_factor = 4, mixed_ratio_ratio_factor = 1.8,
mpc_factor = 1.1. The list of credentialed features was then formatted
as a preferred MS/MS list and the samples were analyzed again in Preferred
Auto MS/MS mode.

Results and Discussion
Autonomous Workflow Optimization:
Auto MS/MS method
The overall design of the autonomous workflow
approach is to simultaneously
acquire MS and MS/MS data during each LC/MS run (Figure 1). The quality of both MS and MS/MS data were of equal importance
and a balance between the amounts of time spent on the acquisition
of each needed to be made. While MS/MS data were necessary to generate
fragmentation patterns for metabolite identification, too long accumulation
times to maximize signal-to-noise and collect high quality MS/MS data
can compromise MS data quality. MS data acquisition is crucial for
metabolite feature detection, profile alignment, comparative and statistical
analyses; however excessive time acquiring MS data could limit the
number of MS/MS spectra and weaken MS/MS spectral quality. Fortunately,
modern Q-TOF mass spectrometers have fast scan rates and high sensitivities
making it possible to collect both MS and MS/MS data simultaneously,
throughout the same run, without compromising overall data quality.

In this study, biological samples were extracted and analyzed on
a Q-TOF mass spectrometer coupled to a capillary LC. The MS/MS spectra
were generated using automated Information Dependent Acquisition (IDA),
whereby the instrument software continuously evaluates the profile
of the precursor ions (MS data) in the full survey scan and triggers
MS/MS acquisition based on a set of criteria that the user inputs
into the method. Instrument settings including acquisition rate, number
of precursor candidate ions, collision energy, and dynamic exclusion
time were optimized for IDA. In the optimized Auto MS/MS method, MS/MS
acquisition was triggered on selected precursor ions that met the
defined criteria of intensity and charge state. A cycle time of 1
s was used for data acquisition where each MS scan was followed by
15 MS/MS events. MS data were acquired at 4 Hz (250 ms accumulation
time for each spectrum) while MS/MS data were acquired at 20 Hz (50
ms accumulation time for each spectrum, and 750 ms in total for 15
MS/MS events). This ensured an approximate duty cycle of 25% on MS
acquisition while simultaneously acquiring up to 15 MS/MS spectra
in the remaining time period. Chromatographic base peak widths for
ions in HILIC HPLC mode were 30 s on average. A cycle time of 1 s
ensured at least 15–30 MS data points acquired for each extracted
ion chromatogram (EIC) peak. Multiple MS data points along the chromatographic
peak are crucial for reliable peak detection, peak area integration,
comparative and statistical analyses. The accumulation time for both
MS and MS/MS acquisitions by UHPLC separation can be reduced 3 to
5 times as features tend to be 3 to 5 times narrower when compared
to capillary LC separation. However, shortening the accumulation time
compromises the sensitivity and data quality.

(EAL) conditions, using both auto MS/MS and MS-only acquisition method.

and MS only method. Red lines, biofilm grown in EAL conditions (n = 4); black lines, biofilm grown in balanced conditions
(n = 4).

Some of the crucial parameters for precursor ion selection
in IDA
mode included a precursor ion intensity threshold of 500 counts, monoisotopic
precursor selection and charge state screening to exclude any feature
that was not singly charged (see Methods). Dynamic exclusion in IDA
mode has been enabled to further reduce the redundancy of precursor
ion selection and expand the MS/MS acquisition coverage. Every precursor
ion that qualified using the preset criteria, was selected for fragmentation
two consecutive times, and was dynamically excluded for the next nine
seconds. Repeated acquisition on the same precursor ion and short
exclusion times were chosen to maintain sufficient redundancy for
MS/MS data acquisition providing higher quality data.

Validation
of Autonomous Workflow: Auto MS/MS versus MS Only
To test
the efficacy of our autonomous workflow a complex biological
matrix from bacterial biofilm culture was investigated. Desulfovibrio
vulgaris Hildenborough (DvH) biofilm samples were grown in
balanced (BAL, n = 4) and in electron acceptor limited
conditions (EAL, n = 4) to obtain insight into the
altered metabolic activity and understand how it could be associated
with a particular phenotype. The metabolic response of DVH biofilms
grown in EAL conditions versus balanced conditions were characterized
and compared using the optimized MS sampling rate and duty cycle as
described above. Analysis was carried out in both MS Only mode (i.e.,
only MS1 acquisition) and Auto MS/MS mode (i.e., MS1 and MS2 acquisition). Out of total aligned features,
thirty six percent of the features that were observed using MS only
method were also observed using the auto MS/MS method (Figure 2A). Forty nine percent of additional unique features
detected by MS only method were likely due to frequent MS1 data acquisition, and therefore higher MS1 signal intensity
and peak definition. Furthermore, 29% of the dysregulated features
(p-value ≤ 0.05, intensity ≥ 1000)
detected with the MS only method were also observed using the Auto
MS/MS acquisition (Figure 2A). The other 28%
were related to chemical noise and false positives or negatives, likely
because of lower peak definition quality. Fold-change is an important
parameter to characterize the degree of metabolite change in perturbed
biological system. An example of one down-regulated metabolite feature
characterized by m/z 132.030 and
retention time of 24.6 min acquired with both methods was used to
demonstrate the consistency of the Auto MS/MS method compared to the
MS only method (Figure 2B). Both acquisition
methods showed similar fold change and statistical significance (Welch t test). MS/MS data acquired using the Auto MS/MS method
allowed for identification of the selected metabolite feature as aspartic
acid. Together, these data demonstrated that Auto MS/MS acquisition
with a 25% duty cycle for MS data collection can reduce data quality
for metabolite feature detection, although the majority of dysregulated
features from comparative analysis were correctly assigned and identified.
In general, the results from the autonomous or conventional untargeted
workflow should be validated using targeted quantification of identified
dysregulated metabolites of interest.23

Autonomous Metabolomic Analysis of Bacterial Biofilm
Further
data analysis of DVH biofilm grown in EAL conditions and
using Auto MS/MS acquisition in negative ionization mode revealed
34% of significantly dysregulated metabolite features (339 features
with p-value ≤ 0.05, and intensity ≥
1000) out of total aligned metabolite features (Figure 3A). Sixty seven of these had MS/MS matches (20%) to the METLIN
metabolite database and 46 were identified using matching score ≥0.5
(Figure 3B). Of these, 36 had KEGG IDs which
were used for biochemical pathway mapping using KEGG small molecules
database. The results of pathway mapping suggested several perturbed
pathways at the cell level, relevant to DVH as a response to biofilm
growth in EAL conditions. The affected purine metabolism was chosen
as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the autonomous workflow
for identifying biologically relevant metabolites (Figure 3C). Specifically, 6 metabolites were mapped onto
the purine metabolism pathway (Figure 3C) and
all of which were down-regulated as much as 6.5 fold (e.g., hypoxanthine).
Statistical information (e.g., fold-change and p-value)
and identification (MS/MS spectral match, METLIN, and KEGG ID) can
be extracted from data set (acquired in Auto MS/MS mode) for each
metabolite in the pathway to facilitate interpretation (Figure 3B). As shown here, the development of the autonomous
metabolomic workflow offered simultaneous metabolite profiling and
metabolite identification, further supporting the use of metabolomics
as a systems biology tool.

A false discovery rate (FDR) used
in proteomics is not feasible here for the MS/MS spectral matching
as no appropriate decoy metabolite databases can be constructed,24 therefore the results need to be further manually
assessed by the user. The relatively low match percentage (up to 20%)
is likely due to incompleteness of the METLIN database and metabolite
databases in general. However, METLIN is rapidly expanding and the
number of successful matches is likely to improve over time. In the
past 3 years METLIN has added more than 6,000 metabolites with MS/MS
data. As of September 2014 METLIN housed more than 12 000 compounds
with MS/MS data. This demonstrates the importance of having a comprehensive
metabolite database and its impact on the metabolite identification
process. As more and more fragmentation data from metabolites and
their derivatives are deposited into METLIN, we expect that our ability
to identify metabolites from biological samples will greatly improve.
The scoring algorithm can also affect the results. Here, we have used
the cosine similarity score for its ease of implementation and interpretation.
However, there are many other scoring algorithms in use today, such
as X-rank25 weighted cosine,17 and others.

Addressing the Coverage
of Autonomous MS/MS Spectra Acquisition
Additional experiments
were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness
of the autonomous workflow for metabolite identification through METLIN
tandem mass spectral matches. In addition to the limitation presented
by the incomplete database two major factors limit the number of matched
features; MS/MS spectral coverage and the match percentage. To determine
the coverage of the autonomous metabolomic approach, we measured a
standard metabolite mixture (40 metabolites, Supporting
Information Table 1) by optimized Auto MS/MS method, and the
results revealed that MS/MS spectra were acquired for 85% of the metabolites
present in the standard mixture. All of these metabolites could be
identified through MS/MS matching against METLIN metabolite database.
The future improvements in instrument scan speed as new instruments
are developed will likely increase this already high MS/MS spectral
coverage. However, increasing the scan speed comes at the detriment
of acquiring good quality MS/MS spectra, therefore, in our case; a
20 Hz acquisition rate was employed as a compromise to achieve higher
numbers of metabolite identifications (Figure 4).

and identification of metabolites. (A) XCMS Cloud plot representation

To maximize scan time, and therefore maximize MS/MS spectral
quality,
we opted to narrow down the number of candidate features via “credentialing”
or defining the real, biologically relevant nonartifactual features.
In an autonomous metabolomic experiment, the objective is to acquire
MS/MS data for all monoisotopic ions of biological origin. Out of
the thousands of ions that are typically detected in an untargeted
metabolomic experiment only a small percentage of these will be relevant,
biological ions. Selecting the appropriate ions for MS/MS analysis,
thus, is a challenge. As demonstrated herein, modern instruments are
capable of intelligently excluding isotopes, charge states, and low
abundance ions from MS/MS analysis. Still, using auto MS/MS, many
ions will be analyzed which are irrelevant to the experiment. This
is due to many monoisotopic, high abundance ions which are the result
of contamination and chemical noise rather than the biological sample.
These peaks waste scans, taking time away from true, relevant metabolites
and effectively decreasing MS/MS coverage. To investigate and address
the challenge of coverage in auto MS/MS experiments we utilized a
credentialing approach. In this approach we performed auto MS/MS on
an extract of E. coli specifically prepared for the
credentialing informatic workflow. This workflow allows the distinction
of biological features and artifactual features (such as contamination
and chemical noise).26

Figure 4 MS/MS spectral matching
of the MS/MS data, acquired “on-the-fly”,
against METLIN metabolite database. MS/MS data were acquired at 50
ms scanning rate per spectra.

Using this information, we assess the coverage of Auto MS/MS
and
whether this coverage can be improved with guided precursor ion selection
(preferred auto MS/MS). As shown in Figure 5, after deisotoping and credentialing, the 12 420 total original
features decreased to 836 credentialed features. The removed artifactual
features correspond to various noise sources, contamination, and isotopes.
The remaining 836 credentialed features represent the biologically
relevant signals of which MS/MS data is desired.

Figure 5 Preferred auto MS/MS
increased MS/MS coverage of credentialed features
relative to a naive experiment. Credentialed or biologically relevant
features comprise only a portion of a metabolomic data set. The utilization
of credentialed features to generate a preferred ion list increased
auto MS/MS coverage to 78% of credentialed features.

The initial experiment resulted in 2606 features
being chosen during
auto MS/MS mode, from the 12 420 total features, of these,
2288 (88%) were artifactual. After credentialing, only 836 features
were detected compared to 12 420, and out of these 836, only
38% (318 features) were picked up by the original auto MS/MS experiment
without credentialing. This low coverage of credentialed features,
and the high number of noncredentialed features assayed, illustrates
the challenge of prioritizing relevant ions for analysis.

To
improve the coverage of relevant ions we applied a preferred
ion list to guide MS/MS precursor selection. The 836 credentialed
features were imported as a preferred ion list and the auto MS/MS
experiment repeated. After addition of the preferred ion list 660
credentialed features were analyzed by MS/MS corresponding to a 207%
increase. This represents 342 new credentialed features which were
analyzed by MS/MS and a large increase in coverage of our method.
The use of a credentialed, preferred auto MS/MS list is a valuable
addition to the autonomous metabolomic workflow for any sample type.
Biological ions from a standard E. coli extract are
easily annotated using the feature credentialing workflow.26 These credentialed features are then used to
generate a preferred ion list and included in the autonomous method.
While this preferred list was generated using E. coli, it is applicable to any biological sample. Preferred ions are only
analyzed if they are present at the proper retention time, so extraneous
ions in the list will not detract from the analysis. Further, the
shared metabolite content of various biological samples ensures that
many metabolites (central carbon metabolism, amino acids, etc.) are
preferentially analyzed over artifactual peaks.

Conclusions
An autonomous workflow that allows for simultaneous MS and MS/MS
data acquisition will enable relative quantification and structural
characterization for the thousands of features observed using untargeted
metabolomics. High quality data acquisition can be accomplished by
taking advantage of the high sensitivity, high mass accuracy and resolution,
and fast scanning speeds of modern mass spectrometers. Key to this
workflow is utilizing the well-established XCMS bioinformatic platform
and the largest metabolite database METLIN that facilitates feature
assignment and identification. Our results revealed that Integrated
MS and MS/MS data acquisition in the autonomous approach significantly
improved the throughput performance, reducing the amount of sample
and time required for the metabolomic experiments. An autonomous metabolomic
approach will thus ultimately allow the more rapid integration of
comparative analyses, metabolite identification, and data analysis
at a systems biology level.
