Hepatocellular
lipid accumulation characterizes nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD). However, the types of lipids associated with
disease progression are debated, as is the impact of their localization.
Traditional lipidomics analysis using liver homogenates or plasma
dilutes and averages lipid concentrations, and does not provide spatial
information about lipid distribution. We aimed to characterize the
distribution of specific lipid species related to NAFLD severity by
performing label-free molecular analysis by mass spectrometry imaging
(MSI). Fresh frozen liver biopsies from obese subjects undergoing
bariatric surgery (n = 23) with various degrees of
NAFLD were cryosectioned and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
(MALDI)-MSI. Molecular identification was verified by tandem MS. Tissue
sections were histopathologically stained, annotated according to
the Kleiner classification, and coregistered with the MSI data set.
Lipid pathway analysis was performed and linked to local proteome
networks. Spatially resolved lipid profiles showed pronounced differences
between nonsteatotic and steatotic tissues. Lipid identification and
network analyses revealed phosphatidylinositols and arachidonic acid
metabolism in nonsteatotic regions, whereas low–density lipoprotein
(LDL) and very low–density lipoprotein (VLDL) metabolism was
associated with steatotic tissue. Supervised and unsupervised discriminant
analysis using lipid based classifiers outperformed simulated analysis
of liver tissue homogenates in predicting steatosis severity. We conclude
that lipid composition of steatotic and nonsteatotic tissue is highly
distinct, implying that spatial context is important for understanding
the mechanisms of lipid accumulation in NAFLD. MSI combined with principal
component–linear discriminant analysis linking lipid and protein
pathways represents a novel tool enabling detailed, comprehensive
studies of the heterogeneity of NAFLD.

==== Body
Nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease
(NAFLD), characterized by hepatocellular lipid accumulation, refers
to liver damage ranging from simple steatosis through steatohepatitis
to cirrhosis.1,2 Recent data indicate that NAFLD
is the most common form of chronic liver disease, and the second leading
cause of liver transplantation.3 The prevalence
of NAFLD is estimated to be ∼30% in healthy versus ∼80%
in obese individuals among the general Western population.1 Comorbidities are frequently observed in patients
with NAFLD,4 which may exacerbate steatosis
or vice versa. Hepatic steatosis is a known risk factor for postoperative
complications after major hepatic surgery;5−7 however, the
relevant amount and type of fat necessary to cause injury are debated.6,8−10 Despite its high prevalence, the pathogenesis of
NAFLD remains unclear, making patient stratification and diagnosis
difficult. Currently, liver biopsy, followed by histopathological
examination, is the gold standard for the diagnosis of NAFLD and assessment
of steatosis severity. Severity is determined by the Kleiner scoring
system, which address 14 histological features.11 Confounding factors, such as sampling bias, factitious
staining artifacts, liver tissue heterogeneity, and the variable manifestation
of hepatic steatosis,12 result in subjective
interpretations.13 Heterogeneity is the
most complex factor to consider in that normal liver consists of zonations
with multiple cell types. Inflammation and steatosis add additional
complexity to liver structure and organization, which contributes
to NASH/NAFLD progression. Histologically these livers samples appear
similar, which renders diagnostics difficult. Altogether, improved
diagnostic methods for NAFLD are urgently required to benefit treatment
decisions and ultimately patient outcomes.

Currently, hepatic
lipid metabolism is primarily studied using
liver homogenates or serum/plasma. However, homogenization of tissue
results in dilution and averaging of molecules, and plasma lipids
do not exclusively reflect liver lipids. Nonetheless, these methods
have been widely applied to assess the potential role of triacylglycerides
(TAGs),1,14−18 phosphatidylcholines (PCs),19−22 phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs),19,21−24 phosphatidylglycerols (PGs),23 as well
as free fatty acids (FFAs)17,22,24 in the development of NAFLD. Whereas the presence of these lipids
and their association with NAFLD has been reported and debated, the
spatial distribution of lipids in liver tissue in the context of NAFLD
has been described in just a few recent studies.20,25,26 Wattacheril et al. and Hall et al. performed
predominantly positive ion mode mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) of
hepatic lipids and showed distinct distribution patterns of PC lipids.
Furthermore, Hall et al. hypothesized a mechanism for disrupted lipid
metabolism in steatosis. Whereas their analyses are primarily based
on a small fraction of lipid species detectable in positive ion mode
MSI, it is known that many lipid classes exhibit preferential ionization
in a negative polarity. For example, phosphatidylinositols (PIs),
phosphatidylserines (PSs), PEs, PGs, and FFAs are ionized more efficiently
in negative ion mode.27,28 In view of this, we performed
negative ion mode MSI of lipid species in human liver biopsies. The
aim of this study was to identify lipids and their distribution profiles
within and between tissue samples, and to integrate our findings with
publicly available molecular databases to pinpoint potential biological
processes directing regional lipid accumulation in NAFLD. Furthermore,
mathematical tissue classifiers based on spatial vs simulated homogenate
data sets were constructed and compared. Our data demonstrate the
potential of MSI for more detailed NAFLD diagnosis, based on precise
molecular histological classification.

Methods
Materials
A list
with information on additional materials,
consumables, and instrumentation is provided in Supporting Information.

Samples
Between
2006 and 2009, liver wedge biopsies
were obtained from severely obese individuals with a body mass index
(BMI) from 36 to 74 kg m–2 undergoing bariatric
surgery at the Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC+). Patients
with acute or chronic inflammatory diseases, degenerative diseases,
reported alcohol consumption (>10 g/day), or with prescribed anti-inflammatory
drugs were excluded. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics
Board of MUMC+, in line with the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration
of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained in writing from each individual.
Patient characteristics are shown in Supporting Table 1. Human liver biopsies were categorized for severity
of steatosis by a pathologist into 4 groups using the scoring system
of Kleiner et al.11

Sample Preparation and
MSI Data Acquisition
Fresh frozen
tissue was cryosectioned at 10 μm thickness, at −18 °C
on a Cryostat HM525 (Microm, Walldorf, Germany) and thaw mounted to
Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass slides (Delta Technologies, Loveland,
CO, USA).29 The 23 liver biopsies, 1 cryosection
per biopsy, were distributed onto three ITO slides in a randomized
manner to minimize batch effects. MSI experiments were performed on
two technical replicates.

A protocol for sample preparation
that targets lipids was employed. Briefly, norharmane matrix (Merck
KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) was sublimed onto the vacuum-dried tissue
with a custom-built sublimation device (IDEE, Maastricht University,
The Netherlands) to enable the analysis of lipid species by MALDI-MSI.
Data acquisition was performed with the Bruker RapifleX MALDI Tissuetyper
system operating in reflectron mode (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen,
Germany). Data were acquired in negative ion mode at the mass range
300–2000 Da with the raster pixel size of 50 μm. On average,
3400 spatially resolved spectra were recorded per tissue section with
typical mass accuracy ∼50 ppm. The speed of acquisition was
roughly 25 pixels/s, which resulted in an analysis time of approximately
2 min per biopsy.

High mass resolution imaging was performed
on a representative
tissue section using an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Bremen, Germany) coupled to a reduced-pressure MALDI source30 to identify characteristic lipids that were
deemed distinctive by MALDI-Time of Flight (TOF) mass spectrometer.
Data was acquired with a pixel size of 40 μm and a mass resolution
of 240 000 at mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 400. Mass accuracy was typically 2 ppm or better. To
further identify lipids, high-mass-resolution (240 000 at m/z 400), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)
was performed using higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with
a normalized collision energy of 50 and an isolation width of 0.7
Da on dedicated samples. A 5-s injection time was used while the sample
continuously moved to accumulate sufficient precursor ions and increase
the fragment ion signal for low intensity lipids during tandem MS.
This methodology allowed for confident lipid ID assignment, however,
the total analysis time per tissue was several hours. This targeted
identification approach complements the high throughput MSI of the
complete cohort. The data were analyzed using Xcalibur software v.2.3.26
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). When multiple isobaric
ions were observed, manual comparison of Orbitrap ion distribution
image and the MALDI-TOF data set was performed for correct correlation,
and the most abundant ion was chosen for identification.

Histological
Staining
The MALDI-MS images were overlaid
with microscopic images of the same tissue section to facilitate alignment
of the molecular distribution with the morphology of liver tissue.
The MALDI matrix was removed post-MSI analysis by slide submersion
in 100% ethanol to enable overlay of different imaging modalities
from the same tissue. Subsequently, standard hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) staining was applied according to the supplier’s
instructions (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Subsequently, the slides
were imaged with a Microscope using the bright-field Leica DM6000B
(Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) light microscope and MIRAX scanner (Zeiss,
Breda, The Netherlands).

Tissue Annotation
The histologically
stained tissues
were blindly evaluated by an experienced liver pathologist (J.V.),
including morphological tissue annotation of steatotic regions, inflammation
areas, and portal sclerosis.

MSI Data Analysis
Several data analysis
strategies
were applied, as schematically represented in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic overview of the parallel data analyses
performed.

MSI Data Processing
The raw MALDI-TOF data was loaded
into Fleximaging software v.4.1 (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany),
where the MSI image was semiautomatically overlaid (using fiducial
markers) with a histological optical image of the same tissue section.
This overlay was necessary to define the tissue vs background boundaries.
All individually aligned samples were then imported to SCiLS software
v.2016a (SCiLS, Bremen, Germany) where they were together normalized
by total ion count. The overall mean spectrum from all 23 samples
was extracted and exported to mMass v.5.531 where it was subjected to autoscaling, baseline subtraction, and
smoothing (Gaussian algorithm with window size of 0.1 m/z and 2 cycles). Peak picking was performed on
the spectrum with the peak intensity threshold relative to base peak
set to 1%. Finally, the resulting peak list was imported back to SCiLS
with the window size per peak adjusted to 0.13 Da yielding the optimal
area under the curve (AUC) for integration.

Identification of Molecular
Signature Per Region of Interest
The ion’s distribution
and colocalization with an annotated
tissue region were assessed by Pearson’s correlation coefficient
computed using SCiLS software. In order to verify and quantify the
importance and the discriminatory power of a particular m/z ion, receiver operating characteristic (ROC)32 analysis was performed.

Integration of Lipid MSI
Data into Pathway Analysis
After the extraction of m/z values
of interest based on their spatial distribution, MADLI-Orbitrap identification
of the molecules was performed first at the sum-composition level
as [M – H]− ions utilizing accurate mass
measurements and further by MS/MS to identify fatty acyl compositions.
The lipid nomenclature is explained in the Supporting Information.

To explore known and predicted interactions
and to build a lipid–protein interaction network from our MSI
data, each identified molecule was represented by a unique PubChem
compound ID. Subsequently, using these identified molecules, GeneGo’s
MetaCore software (Thomson Reuters, NY, USA)33 (v.6.32 build 69020) constructed the lipid–protein interaction
network based on known and predicted interactions in curated human
databases. Dijkstra’s34 shortest-path
algorithm with the maximum number of steps in the path set to 10 was
used to ensure a fully connected network per region. Briefly, this
algorithm builds a network with the smallest possible number of directed
one-step interactions between pairs of initial objects. Finally, the
identified connections were further investigated to highlight the
biomolecular mechanisms and extrapolate their biological relevance.

Multivariate Data Analysis
Principal component analysis
(PCA), a linear unsupervised statistical method describing the largest
variances within the data set, was performed using the ChemomeTricks
toolbox for Matlab (v.R2015, The MathWorks, Natick, MA).35 PCA was first applied to discard nontissue–specific
signal, second to reduce the dimensionality of the data. We assumed
that the molecular differences between the steatosis groups were the
main sources of variance and could thus be captured by PCA. PCA was
applied pixel-by-pixel to samples individually as well as to all 23
samples at once. We performed PCA coupled to linear discriminant analysis
(LDA) to capture the molecular signature of steatosis. Contrary to
PCA, LDA is a supervised statistical method used to define classes
within predefined groups, for example, steatosis grade 0 versus steatosis
grade 1. The input variables for LDA were principle components (PCs)
from prior PCA. The crucial step in PCA-LDA is the estimation of the
required input variables, addressed as previously described by Mascini
et al.36 Here, the number of PCs that explained
80% of the variance was the optimum. Linear combinations of the PCs
that maximized the Fisher’s criterion, that is, the ratio of
the between-class variance and the within-class variance, were calculated.
A sample was categorized to class A if the mean discriminant score
of the sample spectra was closest to the score of class A.

To
address overfitting common to analyzing multidimensional data sets,
we cross-validated the PCA-LDA results using the leave-one-out methodology,
which is widely accepted for small sample sizes (n < 30).35,36 Additional validation of the
PCA-LDA classifier was based on its classification accuracy performance
test using the replicate of all 23 samples as the test set. Accuracy
is expressed as percentage of correctly classified samples during
the leave-one-out cross-validation.

Simulation of Tissue Homogenization
Effect
Tissue homogenization
effects were simulated by averaging of all pixels (spectra) per biopsy
from MALDI-TOF-MSI to one representative spectrum. The 23 average
spectra were subjected to the same PCA-LDA analysis, where 80% of
variance-containing PCs were used to build the 4-class LDA.

Gene
Expression
We extracted gene expression data37 from 35 patient samples, of which 15 were taken
from the same patients analyzed by MSI. Samples were categorized into
steatosis groups using the Kleiner11 scoring
system: grade 0, n = 7; grade 1, n = 9; grade 2, n = 16; grade 3, n = 3. Gene expression was analyzed in the ‘R’ statistical
computing environment (version 3.3.0, https://www.R-project.org/). Gene expression levels with identical gene symbols were averaged.
Box plots were created for the genes identified by the lipid–protein
interaction analysis, in which the samples with corresponding MSI
data are shown as markers.

Results
MSI of Tissue
Samples
MSI has proven to be an exceptional
tool for rapid detection, localization, and identification of thousands
of molecules simultaneously and directly from complex sample surfaces.29,38,39 MSI retains sensitive spatial
molecular information, typically with spatial resolution of 20–50
μm. We collected 112 539 spectra for 23 obese patients
categorized into 4 groups, ranging from no steatosis (grade 0) to
severe steatosis (grade 3) (Supporting Table 1). These spectra were analyzed as shown in Figure 1. Images of H&E stained tissue were coregistered
with the MSI images to visualize individual molecular species in relation
to tissue morphology.

Pixel-Wise PCA Analysis Robustly Identified
Steatotic Tissue
Regions
After initial preprocessing of the raw MALDI-TOF
data, pixel-wise PCA was performed. Co-registration of PC score plots
to histology images exposed particular PCA patterns corresponding
to the pathological annotations. PC1 and PC2 mainly contained foreground
versus background signal. PC3 delineated steatotic (positive loading,
PC+3) versus nonsteatotic (negative loading, PC–3) regions
(Figure 2). The corresponding
loading spectrum exhibits different molecular signatures matching
morphologically distinct tissue regions which indicate a heterogeneous
and region-specific lipid distribution within the tissue. Next, we
tested the robustness of PC3 identified as the steatotic signature
from this one sample by projecting it onto the remaining 22 samples.
The pixel-wise pattern resulting from the projection coarsely matches
the annotated H&E staining in each of the 22 tissues (Supporting Figure 1). This suggests that the
steatosis-specific signature is robust across different patients with
histomorphological significant steatosis (>5%). The top 10 PCA
identified
ions for steatotic and nonsteatotic tissue (Supporting Table 2; full ion list in Supporting Tables 3 and 4) revealed a unique lipid composition for nonsteatotic
and steatotic tissues.

MALDI-TOF-MSI
data in negative-ion mode. Projection of PCA loading (PC3) from a
representative tissue section delineates nonsteatotic (top, PC–3)
and steatotic (bottom, PC+3) regions. Ion images are scaled to relative
intensity. These regions correspond well to histological annotations
(middle). Molecular intensity-scaled loading spectra of the PC function
show unique molecular mass profiles for each tissue region. Note that
PC–3 is shown with absolute values for easier interpretation.

Distinct Lipid Species
Distributions in Steatotic and Nonsteatotic
Regions
Independent supervised data analysis was employed
on the same MALDI-TOF data set to further investigate the lipid species
profiles in steatosis. The steatotic and nonsteatotic tissue regions
were manually annotated. We aimed to identify individual ions discriminating
the two tissue types. Several ions showed high correlation coefficients
with tissue type as well as high ROC values (Supporting Table 5) which indicates that their distribution was associated
with steatosis. Identification and structural assignments of the discriminatory
ions were performed. Combining the MALDI-Orbitrap high mass resolution
data and MS/MS searches allowed for identification of over 80 lipid
species (Supporting Tables 3 and 4). Among
the most discriminatory ions, PG(18:1_20:4) (m/z 795.4) exhibited distinct localization in steatotic areas
(Figure 3A), abundance
in each pixel, and a high ROC value (AUC 0.838) (Figure 3B), demonstrating it may be
a steatosis-specific lipid. Another lipid species, PG(18:2_22:6) (m/z 817,4), also exhibited a distinct distribution
pattern in steatosis. In addition, its distribution was visualized
in all 23 biopsies. On a pixel level, clear regional intensity of
PG(18:2_22:6) was observed with localized differences in abundance
(Figure 4A) corresponding
to histological steatotic regions (Supporting Figure 4). However, when the overall ion intensity of PG(18:2_22:6)
across the cohort was displayed (Figure 4B), the differences in ion abundance were
not profound, which may be explained by the lack of localized annotation.
Among the top 10 PCA discriminatory ions, PIs were identified six
times in nonsteatotic tissues but not identified at all in steatotic
tissues (Supporting Table 2). Indeed, correlation
and ROC analysis showed a lower abundance of PI lipid species in steatotic
tissue compared to nonsteatotic tissue. These observations suggest
a disruption in cellular signaling and trafficking via the phosphatidylinositol
cascade in steatosis.40,41 Conversely, PEs were identified
as 5 of the top 10 discriminatory ions in steatotic tissues but not
identified in nonsteatotic tissues (Supporting Table 2).

compared to nonsteatotic tissue regions (pixels). The horizontal line

and the bars signify the standard deviation.

content: group 1 (<5% steatosis, green); group 2 (5–33%
steatosis, blue); group 3 (>33–66% steatosis, black); and
group
4 (>66% steatosis, red).

Network Enrichment Analyses Identify Lipid–Protein Interaction
Networks Related to Inflammation Processes
Next, we performed
a network analysis to determine whether the specific lipid species
identified in our data set could be involved in specific metabolic
pathways. The MALDI-MSI PCA identified 39 lipids enriched in nonsteatotic
regions and 47 lipids in steatotic regions. Since many isobaric species
may be present, multiple PubChem IDs were allowed per lipid peak (Supporting Tables 3 and 4), yielding 68 lipid
IDs enriched in nonsteatotic and 95 lipid IDs enriched in steatotic
regions. Despite the high number of PubChem IDs available for the
analysis, only 4 (PE(16:0/20:4), PE(16:0/18:2), PS(16:0/18:1), PE(16:0/18:1))
and 3 (PG(16:0/18:0), PS(20:3/20:4), PA(18:0/20:4)) were recognized
in the database for steatotic and nonsteatotic lipids, respectively.
The network analysis resulted in almost independent networks for each
tissue type, pointing out that the metabolic processes in these tissue
types are divergent. The interaction networks consisted of 3 highly
interconnected nodes (hubs): arachidonic acid (AA) and the diacylglycerol
kinase (DGK) reaction (Icosa-5,8,11,14-tetraenoic acid [1-(hydroxymethyl)-2-octadecanoyloxy-ethyl]
ester + ATP = 1-Stearoyl-2-arachidonoylphosphatidic acid + ADP), and
phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). The network (52 nodes and 57 interactions, Supporting Table 6) revealed AA metabolism in
nonsteatotic tissue, whereas low–density lipoprotein (LDL)
metabolism including small, very small and large LDL were identified
in steatotic regions (Figure 5). Gene expression confirmed the expression of enzymes with
important functions within the inflammation pathways (Supporting Figure 5). In particular, several
genes of the phospholipase group of enzymes (PLA2) and diacylglycerol
kinase (DGK) family were expressed in patients with more severe steatosis.

interaction network determined from lipids
prevalent in nonsteatotic (blue) and steatotic (green) regions.

Data-Driven PCA-LDA Classifier
Discriminates 4 Steatosis Groups
with Tissue-Specific Lipid Profiles
Next, we performed PCA-LDA
to evaluate whether the lipid-specific signature for steatosis identified
by MALDI-MSI could predict steatosis development and progression.
We stratified the samples into 4 groups per steatosis grade as determined
by the pathologist (Supporting Table 1),
and PCA-LDA was built using 200 PCs (80% variance) from all ∼100 000
pixels/spectra. The resulting discriminant function showed the separation
of the 4 steatosis grades (Figure 6), with a direct hit (4 groups) leave-one-out cross-validation
accuracy of 48%. When a shift of neighboring groups was allowed (that
is grade 0 ↔ 1 or 2 ↔ 3), predictive accuracy improved
to 96%. Additional validation was performed using a technical replicate
of all 23 biopsies as test set and confirmed the accuracy of the results.
Classification performance together with confusion matrix is shown
in Supporting Table 7.

Histogram (middle right) showing
the distribution of the 4 classes along the discriminant function
1 (DF1, middle left). Intensity-scaled loading spectra (top and bottom)
displaying the mass channels associated with the discriminatory power
of DF1 for nonsteatotic (top) and steatotic grades (bottom). Projection
of the DF score onto the training set of MS images, where each pixel
is given a color based on its DF1 score. The color code indicates
the 4 classes used in the PCA-LDA classifier, which corresponds to
steatosis stages 0 to 4, blue to orange, respectively.

Since the spatial information was retained, the
discriminant function
(its score) could be projected onto each pixel and color-coded blue
to red. In this way, we visualized pixel by pixel the heterogeneous
lipid composition of steatotic and nonsteatotic tissue regions for
the whole data set. Figure 6 shows that tissues with steatosis grade 0 or 1 were mostly
color-coded blue, whereas tissues with grade 2–3 were mostly
orange. Within a tissue, MSI-based PCA-LDA patterns matched the histological
annotation of nonsteatotic versus steatotic regions. Interestingly,
the regions denoted by histology as nonsteatotic in biopsies with
grade 2 or 3 were color coded based on the MS profiles as yellow or
green. This indicates an already altered metabolic profile in these
regions compared with the nonsteatotic tissue region in biopsies with
grade 0 or 1 which were colored blue based on their MS profile.

The effect of homogenization was simulated by averaging the spectra
over all pixels within a liver biopsy and then building a PCA-LDA
using the resulting 23 spectra. A histogram displaying the first discriminant
function for the averaged 23 spectra PCA-LDA classifier (Supporting Figure 6) clearly showed the failure
of the homogenate simulation data to discriminate the 4 steatosis
groups. Results did not improve when more PCs were considered. The
loss of spatial information, reflected in a reduced number of PCs,
is detrimental to the performance of the classifier.

Discussion
We applied an innovative methodology to retain spatial information
and evaluate local lipid profile changes in progressive stages of
steatosis in NAFLD. Whereas previous studies focused predominantly
on TAGs and PCs,17,20,25 we identified other lipid species and their local distribution,
including specific PI, PE, PG, and PA species in steatosis. Moreover,
our data are from clinically relevant human biopsies. By presenting
a unique combination of high-quality structural lipid identification
and evaluation of its interrelationship by systematic network analysis,
we demonstrate how systematic lipid identification delineates the
metabolic changes during NAFLD progression at the cellular/tissue
level.

First, using pixel-wise analysis of MALDI-MSI data, we
distinguished
steatotic from nonsteatotic tissue. To demonstrate the strength of
this approach, we performed simulated homogenate values, by averaging
the spectra over all pixels within a liver biopsy, and showed that
the resulting PCA-LDA classifier failed to discriminate the steatosis
groups. The inability to detect subtle changes in the simulated homogenized
data may be attributed to the dilution effect upon homogenization.
In contrast, these subtle changes are retained when imaging data is
analyzed. Localized MSI measurements are therefore likely to contribute
to our understanding of the pathophysiology of lipid accumulation
in NAFLD and its consequences.

Next, we showed that the steatotic
lipid fingerprint identified
by MALDI-MSI had high predictive accuracy, demonstrating potential
use for clinical applications. Whereas the direct hit classification
performed with 48% accuracy, allowing one group shift improved the
accuracy to 96%. This doubling in accuracy can be explained in two
ways. First, the pathological scoring system underlying the classification
delineates four discrete groups, whereas steatosis severity in reality
is continuous. There is poor conformity and agreement among expert
pathologists concerning the assessment of steatosis severity. A recent
study12 used intra class correlation coefficients
(ICC) to evaluate intra- and interobserver performances and found
ICC of 0.57 regarding the assessment of total steatosis (ICC of 0.7
indicates acceptable agreement). The significant jump in accuracy
when we allowed a one-group shift at the extreme groups is likely
to partially result from misclassification of borderline cases by
the pathologist. Second, the small sample size and overfitting of
the classifier could be responsible. The inherent nature of LDA causes
the removal of interpatient variance within one group when building
the classifier. This is further compounded when the test sample is
scored, yielding misclassification because the small sample size is
unable to compensate for heterogeneity within one group of patients.

Our data set uncovers potential underlying lipid metabolism and
homeostasis changes in the liver that may contribute to steatosis
progression. The top 10 discriminatory peaks that were identified
by PCA analysis belonged to PI, PG and PS classes in nonsteatotic
regions and PE, PG, and PA classes in steatotic regions. The loss
of PI and increased prevalence of PE species in steatosis may suggest
how lipid metabolism is dysregulated in NAFLD. Additionally, network
analysis revealed diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) as a core reaction in
nonsteatotic tissue (Figure 5). Interestingly, DGK is downstream of the phosphoinositide
pathway, indicating its importance in nonsteatotic metabolic processes.
The phosphoinositide pathway also plays a key role in liver insulin
signal transduction, linking this back to the insulin resistance comorbidity
of NAFLD.42 Additionally, AA-containing
lipid species were enriched in nonsteatotic tissue. Both AA (as precursor
for eicosanoids17,24,43) and the PI cascade are linked to inflammation, and network analysis
also revealed AA metabolism to be involved. Gene expression data indicated
an increase of phospholipases (PLA1a and PLA2) in patients with more
severe steatosis. These enzymes have important functions within the
inflammation pathways, recognizing and hydrolyzing the sn-2 acyl bond
of AA-containing phospholipids thereby releasing AA and lysolipids.
Therefore, this observation suggests that local elevation of AA concentrations
in steatotic regions may directly contribute to the initiation of
inflammatory responses at these sites. AA is also associated with
insulin resistance,44 which further underscores
the potential impact of AA on the development of NAFLD. Because of
the tight regulation of AA levels in healthy tissues, we hypothesize
that AA dysregulation in steatosis is due to aberrant hydrolysis of
intracellular pools of AA-containing phospholipids by phospholipases,
increasing cytoplasmic AA concentrations and stimulating the eicosanoid
inflammation cascade.45 Our findings are
in line with those from Hall et al., who indicated that AA could be
linked to local inflammation using data obtained from mouse models
of NAFLD and a validation cohort of patients with NAFLD with unknown
etiology. Furthermore, our lipid analysis supports the hypothesis
of Chiappini et al.22, indicating decrease of lipid synthesis
such as the eicosanoid precursors leading to global reduction of phospholipids
in NAFLD. Despite the reduction of AA-containing lipids and increased
PLA2 gene expression in steatosis, we did not observe increases in
the corresponding hydrolysis products (free AA and lysolipids) in
steatotic regions. A plausible explanation for lysolipids could be
increased lipid remodeling, i.e., the rapid addition of another fatty
acyl to the lysolipid yielding another intact lipid moiety. With respect
to AA, our network analysis also revealed low–density lipoprotein
metabolism to be associated with steatosis, where the LDL receptor
pathway was previously found to deliver AA for eicosanoid formation.43 Thus, the absence of free AA may be due to its
immediate processing within these inflammatory pathways. Another reason
for not observing the lysolipids as well as free fatty acids could
be their very reactive nature and cytotoxicity. These molecules are
thus cleared and processed by the cell machinery immediately upon
release. Finally, detection of these low molecular mass ions is complicated
by inference of matrix ions and lower sensitivity of MALDI-TOF MSI
in this mass range.

Conclusion
We conclude that regions
associated with a steatotic phenotype
exhibit a distinct lipid composition compared to nonsteatotic tissue.
In particular, steatotic regions showed a loss of AA-containing intracellular
phospholipids: PI and PE species predominantly. These findings are
consistent with an important role for the eicosanoid cascade in driving
inflammatory responses in NAFLD, and may directly link lipid metabolism
changes to inflammation-mediated clinical comorbidities. The combination
of MSI and bioinformatic analyses in a systems biology approach provided
molecule-based histological classifications of liver tissue. This
integration strategy represents a new way to study localized lipid
distribution and will contribute to our understanding of how altered
lipid metabolism, homeostasis, and distributions contribute to steatosis
progression in NAFLD.
