Noncovalent
mass spectrometry (MS) is emerging as an invaluable
technique to probe the structure, interactions, and dynamics of membrane
proteins (MPs). However, maintaining native-like MP conformations
in the gas phase using detergent solubilized proteins is often challenging
and may limit structural analysis. Amphipols, such as the well characterized
A8-35, are alternative reagents able to maintain the solubility of
MPs in detergent-free solution. In this work, the ability of A8-35
to retain the structural integrity of MPs for interrogation by electrospray
ionization-ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (ESI-IMS-MS)
is compared systematically with the commonly used detergent dodecylmaltoside.
MPs from the two major structural classes were selected for analysis,
including two β-barrel outer MPs, PagP and OmpT (20.2 and 33.5
kDa, respectively), and two α-helical proteins, Mhp1 and GalP
(54.6 and 51.7 kDa, respectively). Evaluation of the rotationally
averaged collision cross sections of the observed ions revealed that
the native structures of detergent solubilized MPs were not always
retained in the gas phase, with both collapsed and unfolded species
being detected. In contrast, ESI-IMS-MS analysis of the amphipol solubilized
MPs studied resulted in charge state distributions consistent with
less gas phase induced unfolding, and the presence of lowly charged
ions which exhibit collision cross sections comparable with those
calculated from high resolution structural data. The data demonstrate
that A8-35 can be more effective than dodecylmaltoside at maintaining
native MP structure and interactions in the gas phase, permitting
noncovalent ESI-IMS-MS analysis of MPs from the two major structural
classes, while gas phase dissociation from dodecylmaltoside micelles
leads to significant gas phase unfolding, especially for the α-helical
MPs studied.

==== Body
Membrane
proteins (MPs) and
their assemblies play vital roles in numerous biological processes
and are common therapeutic targets.1 Despite
the fundamental role MPs play in vivo, their structural
and functional characterization is hampered by their insolubility
in aqueous solution, aggregation propensity, and difficulties in obtaining
material in adequate quantities and of sufficient purity for analysis.2 One major bottleneck of structural and functional
studies of MPs is finding a suitable amphiphile that solubilizes and
stabilizes the native protein structure for analysis.3 To achieve this, detergents are commonly added above their
critical micelle concentration (CMC) to MP-containing solutions. Detergent
micelles, however, are a relatively poor membrane mimetic for many
reasons, including their highly curved nature, relatively high monomeric
concentrations (when compared with lipids), and altered lateral pressure.4−6 As a result, many studies have demonstrated that solubilization
of MPs with detergents may perturb their structure, influence their
dynamics, or lead to aggregation.5,7−11 Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop and utilize alternative
methods of solubilization that maintain the structural and functional
integrity of MPs for biochemical analysis.

As an alternative
to detergent micelles, MPs can be solubilized
by means of amphipathic polymers (amphipols, Apols) which function
by interacting strongly with the surfaces of MPs via hydrophobic interactions.12−14 The hydrophilic groups of the Apol maintain the solubility of the
resultant complex. MP/Apol assemblies are highly stable, with the
Apols having an extremely slow dissociation rate from the complex,
resulting in increased MP stability in solution (e.g., bacteriorhodopsin
has been shown to be stable for 7 days at 40 °C, while solubilization
with detergent leads to protein aggregation within hours under these
conditions).12,13 There is an array of Apols with
various structures, but the best characterized is the anionic A8-35
(Figure 1a), a polyacrylate polymer that is
randomly grafted with octyl and isopropyl side chains.15 Their structural diversity, general applicability,
and novel properties have meant that Apols have been used to solubilize
MPs for analysis using many structural techniques.16−23

Mass spectrometry (MS) is being
employed increasingly for the study
of MPs, with a variety of MS-based methods being developed for this
purpose.24−28 Noncovalent electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS, a technique that allows
the native structure and noncovalent interactions of proteins to be
retained in the gas phase, is especially valuable, particularly for
determining the stoichiometry of MP assemblies, identifying bound
species such as lipids, and gaining mechanistic insight into vital
biological processes.29−36 Coupling noncovalent ESI-MS with ion mobility spectrometry (IMS)
allows the rotationally averaged collision cross sections (CCSs) of
ions to be measured, together with their mass, in a single experiment,37,38 which can afford information about the structure and dynamics of
MPs.39,40 To date, analysis of MPs by ESI-IMS-MS has
relied on solubilization of the MP with detergents, with collisional
activation of the MP/detergent complex in vacuo leading
to release of the MP. However, it has been proposed that transitioning
to detergent-free methods for the study of MPs by ESI-MS may lead
to increased stabilization of MP structure in the gas phase, especially
for proteins which require defined lipid environments.41

Several methods have been developed for
the structural characterization
of MPs by ESI-MS in the absence of detergent. MPs solubilized in amphipols,
bicelles, and nanodiscs have been analyzed by ESI-MS,41−44 with gas phase collisional activation leading to release of the
MP from the assembly. Of these alternative solubilization methods,
only MPs released from amphipols have been analyzed by ESI-IMS-MS,42 but a systematic study of the differences in
the ESI-IMS-MS spectra of MPs solubilized in either detergent or one
of these alternative amphiphiles has not yet been reported. The one
ground-breaking ESI-MS study that has been published to date proposed
(based on charge state distributions) that more native-like conformers
of MPs can be observed using amphipols, bicelles, and nanodiscs over
detergents.41 However, it remains uncertain
if altering the solubilizing agent leads to differences in the conformational
states of MPs in the gas phase and whether any general “rules”
of which particular solubilizing agent is optimal for different MPs,
or if each MP will behave differently, remain to be resolved.

In this work, we report, for the first time, a systematic comparison
of the ESI-IMS-MS data of two very different structural classes of
MPs solubilized either with detergent micelles of n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM) or with the Apol
A8-35; furthermore, the solution phase and gas phase characteristics
are compared. We chose for study the two β-barrel MPs, the acyl
transferase PagP and the proteinase OmpT (Figure 1b),42,45 together with the two all α-helical
MPs Mhp1,46−48 a paradigm for the 5-helical inverted repeat transporter
superfamily (5HIRT), and GalP,49−51 a paradigm for the Major Facilitator
Superfamily (MFS) (Figure 1c), as members of
the two major structural classes of MP molecular architectures. High
resolution structures (or in the case of GalP, a homology model based
on the structure of XylE [30% identical in sequence])52 of these four proteins are available, thus enabling a comparison
of the measured CCSs with those estimated on the basis of these structures.

Methods
OMP Expression
and Purification
PagPhis and OmpThis were
overexpressed in
BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells and isolated as
inclusion bodies according to published protocols.56,57 Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA,
pH 8.0, containing 1 mM PMSF and 2 mM benzamidine, and lysed by sonication.
The lysate was pelleted by centrifugation (25 000g, 20 min, 4 °C), and the inclusion bodies were resuspended in
50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, stirred at room
temperature for 1 h to permit solubilization of residual membranes,
and then pelleted. The inclusion bodies were washed twice with 50
mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with stirring and pelleting at each stage.

Purification of PagPhis and OmpThis was achieved
by means of Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography. The inclusion
bodies were solubilized in denaturing buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0,
250 mM NaCl, and 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, GuHCl) and filtered
through a 0.22 μm syringe filter. The protein was bound to Ni2+-NTA resin, and the resin washed with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 6 M GuHCl, and 20 mM imidazole. PagPhis or OmpThis were eluted with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250
mM NaCl, 6 M GuHCl, and 250 mM imidazole, and the protein was precipitated
by overnight dialysis against deionized H2O. The protein
was stored as a precipitate at −20 °C.

Denatured
PagPhis and OmpThis were refolded
by drop dilution into detergent-containing solution using previously
published protocols.58 Briefly, 1 mL of
PagPhis or OmpThis (5 mg.mL–1) solubilized in 25 mM Tris-HCl and 6 M GuHCl, pH 8.0, was added
dropwise to 20 mL of a stirring solution containing 10 mM Tris-HCl
and 0.5% (w/v) N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide (LDAO), pH 8.0. The solution was incubated overnight
with agitation at 4 °C. The solution was filtered through a 0.2
μm syringe filter and loaded onto a 1 mL HisTrap column (GE
Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Bucks, U.K.) equilibrated with 10 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1% (w/v) LDAO. A linear gradient over 10 column
volumes was introduced to exchange the buffer to 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.0, and 0.02% (w/v) DDM. The protein was eluted with 10 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8.0, 0.02% (w/v) DDM, and 200 mM imidazole, snap frozen, and stored
at −80 °C.

Cold SDS-PAGE
Samples of either PagP or OmpT from folding
reactions (10 μM) were mixed with 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer
[50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.1% (w/v) bromophenol
blue, and 10% (v/v) glycerol]. The samples were then immediately loaded
onto a Tris–Tricine SDS-PAGE gel either prior to (“cold
SDS-PAGE”)59 or after heating (95
°C for 5 min). Gels were stained using Instant Blue stain (Expedeon
Ltd., Swavesey, Cambridge, UK). Folded and denatured/unfolded OMPs
have different electrophoretic mobilities with native OMPs resisting
unfolding by SDS in the absence of heat.59 Separation of these states of the protein by cold SDS-PAGE permits
their relative quantitation by densitometry analysis. This same behavior
is not observed for α-helical MPs.

Expression and Purification
of Transport Proteins
Mhp1
and GalP were expressed in E. coli, as previously
described, using 100 L fermenters.47,60 Cells were
harvested using a continuous flow centrifuge, disrupted by explosive
decompression, and the inner membranes were isolated by separation
on a sucrose density gradient, before being stored at −80 °C.47,60 The inner membranes were solubilized with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0,
20 mM imidazole, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 300 mM NaCl, and 1% (w/v) DDM
(60 mL) for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The membranes
were pelleted by ultracentrifugation (120 000g, 1 h, 4 °C), and the supernatant was mixed with 4 mL of Ni-NTA
resin for 3 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The unbound material
was removed, and the Ni2+-NTA resin was washed with 10
mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.05%
(w/v) DDM. The protein was eluted from the resin with 10 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8.0, 200 mM imidazole, 2.5% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.05% (w/v) DDM.
The eluate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the
HisProbe-HRP antibody conjugate (Thermo Scientific, Hemel Hempstead,
Herts., UK).

Amphipol Trapping
MPs were trapped
in Apol by adding
A8-35 (Affymetrix Ltd., High Wycombe, Bucks., U.K.) to detergent solubilized
MPs in a 1:5 (w/w) ratio of MP/A8-35 and then incubating on ice for
30 min. The detergent was removed by incubating with BioBeads (Bio-Rad,
Hemel Hempstead, Herts., UK) (20 g wet beads per g of detergent) for
1 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. A8-35 trapped MPs were then
dialyzed against 100 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, at
4 °C for 24 h.

Circular Dichroism
Far-UV circular
dichroism (CD) spectra
were recorded on a Chirascan CD spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics,
Leatherhead, Surrey, UK) using a 0.1 mm path length cuvette. Spectra
shown are the average of three scans that were acquired over the range
of 200–260 nm with a bandwidth of 1 nm and a scan speed of
20 nm min–1. The buffer contribution was subtracted
from each sample. For the amphipol containing samples, buffer containing
the appropriate amount of A8-35 was used as the reference.

PagP
Activity Assay
An enzymatic assay for PagP activity
was performed as previously described.42,56 Briefly, p-nitrophenyl palmitate (p-NPP, 1 mM) was added (from a
10 mM solution in 2-propanol) to a solution of PagP (5 μM in
100 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, supplemented with either
0.02% (w/v) DDM or 0.03 mg·mL–1 A8-35). The
hydrolysis of p-NPP to p-nitrophenol (p-NP) was monitored
over 60 min by observing the increase in absorbance at 410 nm.

OmpT
Activity Assay
The protease activity of OmpT was
assessed by monitoring the time-dependent cleavage of a self-quenching
fluorescent peptide (Abz-ARRAY-NO3, Peptide Protein Research,
Fareham, Hampshire, UK).42,61 Cleavage of the peptide
was detected as increased fluorescence at 430 nm following excitation
at 325 nm using a QuantaMaster spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology
International, Ford, West Sussex, UK). The fluorescence assay was
initiated by addition of peptide (192 μM) to varying concentrations
of folded OmpT (150 nM to 3.2 μM) in 100 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, supplemented with either 1:5 (w/w) A8-35 or 0.02%
(w/v) DDM. Samples were mixed manually, resulting in a dead time of
5–10 s. Assays were repeated in the presence or absence of
1 mg·mL–1 lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Sigma-Aldrich,
Gillingham, Dorset, UK). Specific activities were calculated from
the initial rate in the increase of fluorescence, correcting for OmpT
concentration, OmpT folding yield (judged by cold SDS-PAGE),59 peptide concentration, and end point fluorescence
(after 1 h). The mean activity for OmpT solubilized in either A8-35
or DDM was calculated from three repeats at four concentrations of
OmpT (n = 12). OmpT specific activity units are displayed
as mol(peptide cleaved)·mol–1(OmpT)·s–1 (eq 1). The specific activities
of OmpT in A8-35 and DDM were significantly different as determined
by an unpaired parametric t test (p < 0.05). 1  

Mhp1 and GalP Binding Assays
The ability of DDM and
A8-35 solubilized Mhp1 and GalP to bind known targets was assessed
by fluorescence emission spectroscopy on a QuantaMaster spectrofluorometer
(Photon Technology International, Ford, West Sussex, UK), using previously
published methods.47 Briefly, purified
Mhp1 or GalP (200 μg/mL) solubilized in either 0.02% (w/v) DDM
or by addition of a 1:5 (w/w) excess of A8-35 in 100 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, were analyzed at 20 °C. Tryptophan
fluorescence of protein samples was excited at 295 nm, and the intrinsic
fluorescence emission at 330 nm was monitored. Micromolar additions
of ligand (l-benzylhydantoin for Mhp1 and forskolin for GalP)
were performed from 0 to 2 mM (Mhp1) or 0–100 μM (GalP).
Samples were mixed for 1 min after each addition before measuring
the fluorescence emission spectrum. Nonlinear regression analysis
was performed using GraphPad Prism 6 (Graphpad Software, San Diego,
CA, USA).

Mass Spectrometry
ESI-IMS-MS experiments
were conducted
on a Synapt HDMS mass spectrometer (Waters Ltd., Wilmslow, Manchester,
UK). Nano-ESI was achieved using in-house manufactured gold-plated
borosilicate capillaries. Typically, a capillary voltage of 1.7 kV
was applied; the cone voltage was set to 80–150 V, and a backing
pressure of 6–8 mbar was used. The bias voltage (20–80
V), as well as the voltages applied to the trap (50–100 V)
and transfer (10–50 V) T-waves, were optimized to liberate
the MP from the MP/Apol or MP/detergent complex while minimizing perturbations
to the MP structure. IM separation was achieved by ramping the wave
height from 5 to 30 V, at a speed of 300 ms–1. Collision
induced unfolding (CIU) experiments were conducted by increasing the
Trap collision cell voltage in 5 V increments. Drift times were calibrated
using experimentally determined CCSs of native proteins and applying
a procedure described in detail elsewhere.37,38,62,63 CCSs were
calculated from coordinates deposited in the Protein Data Bank, or
from model structures, using a scaled projection approximation (PSA).64 Aqueous CsI was used for m/z calibration. Data were processed using MassLynx v4.1 and
Driftscope v2.5 software (Waters Ltd., Wilmslow, Manchester, UK) employing
IMS filtering.

Results and Discussion
β-Barrel Outer Membrane
Proteins PagP and OmpT
Two β-barrel outer membrane
proteins (OMPs), PagP and OmpT,
were chosen for the study since these proteins have been shown previously
to fold in A8-35 (both proteins also have crystal structures available
for CCS estimation, required for comparison with MS data),42,65 although a detailed characterization of the effects of MS and solution
conditions on the gas phase structure and stability of these refolded
proteins was not previously carried out nor compared with their behavior
in detergent. PagP is an eight-stranded 20.2 kDa β-barrel OMP
(Figure 1b) whose role in vivo is to transfer a palmitate chain from a phospholipid to lipid A.45 The larger OmpT β-barrel comprises ten
β-strands (33.5 kDa) (Figure 1b) and
functions as an endopeptidase.61

Cold SDS-PAGE confirmed that PagP and OmpT are able to fold successfully
(in excess of 80% yield, as determined by densitometry) in both DDM
and A8-35-containing solutions, as the folded proteins migrate with
an apparent lower molecular weight compared with the unfolded material
(Figures S1a and S2a, Supporting Information).59 Correct folding was also confirmed
by circular dichroism (CD) with negative maxima at 218 nm for PagP
and OmpT indicative of β-sheet structure in both DDM and A8-35
(Figures S1b,c and S2b,c, Supporting Information). CD spectra of PagP solubilized in DDM and A8-35 also have a characteristic
maximum at 232 nm, as a result of the Cotton effect arising from close
packing of residues Tyr26 and Trp66 (Figure S1b,c, Supporting Information).58,66 In a previous
study in which PagP was folded directly into A8-35 from its denatured
state in 8 M urea, this characteristic feature was absent from the
CD spectrum indicating that the final structure, while native-like,
had subtle conformational perturbations.42 The data presented herein show, in contrast, that introduction into
A8-35 from a detergent-folded conformation results in native PagP
which has the characteristic packing of aromatic residues in the core
of the barrel. It should be noted that different folding mechanisms
for PagP have also been observed elsewhere when folding into bilayers
with different lipid compositions and at different lipid/protein ratios,
indicating that folding can be influenced by solution conditions.67

PagP was confirmed to be enzymatically
active when solubilized
with both DDM and A8-35 by monitoring the time dependent increase
in absorbance at 410 nm upon hydrolysis of p-nitrophenol
palmitate (p-NPP) to p-nitrophenol
(p-NP) (Figure S1d, Supporting
Information).56 The protease activity
of OmpT was also assessed by monitoring the ability of the refolded
protein to cleave a fluorogenic peptide (Abz-ARRAY-NO3)
(Figure S2d, Supporting Information). DDM
and A8-35 solubilized OmpT were both inactive in the absence of LPS
but displayed protease activity upon addition of this necessary cofactor.61 However, the activities of the protein in the
two amphiphiles are different, with the DDM solubilized protein having
enhanced activity compared with the A8-35-trapped OmpT (Figure S2d, Supporting Information). Although ligand binding
has been shown to be unaffected in many systems by A8-35, it has been
proposed that conformational changes and interactions may be slowed.12,68 The diminished OmpT activity in A8-35, therefore, may be a consequence
of the restrictive, rigid nature of MP/A8-35 complexes, especially
when compared with dynamic MP/detergent micelle structures.

ESI-IMS-MS analysis of the small OMP, PagP, revealed that the protein
could be released from both DDM micelles and an A8-35 trapped state
when collision energies as low as 60 V were applied in the Trap T-wave
ion guide, resulting in spectra with similar charge state distributions
(Figure 2a,b). Small quantities of DDM-adducted
PagP could also be observed in the ESI-IMS-MS spectrum of PagP, as
previously reported (Figure 2a).65 Analysis of the CCSs of the observed ions indicates
that the structure of PagP is largely retained in the gas phase irrespective
of the amphiphile used to stabilize the MP in solution (Figure 2c). The measured CCSs of PagP at the lowest charge
state observed (+5) were 1857 Å2 in DDM and 1877 Å2 in A8-35 (Table S1, Supporting Information). These CCSs are smaller than that expected for PagP based on its
crystal structure (2290 Å2)65 and indicate that in both instances partial gas phase collapse,
likely of loop regions, occurred, as has been reported previously.65 At higher charge states, an unfolded population
of PagP is observed, likely due to gas phase unfolding (Figure 2c).

plot of PagP (7+ charge state) solubilized with DDM and A8-35.

The similar charge state distributions
and CCSs observed for PagP
in DDM and A8-35 led us to probe the gas phase stability of the protein
solubilized in each amphiphile by performing collision-induced unfolding
(CIU).36,69 The Arrival Time Distributions (ATDs) of
the 7+ ions of PagP at high energies have two features, corresponding
to the collapsed structure and an unfolded conformation, but the unfolded
conformation is absent at low energies (Figure 2d). CIU plots, which indicate the normalized ratio of the collapsed
and unfolded conformations at various collision energies, are shown
in Figure 2e for the 7+ ions of PagP solubilized
with DDM or A8-35, respectively. These demonstrate that the A8-35
solubilized PagP unfolds at higher energies relative to the DDM solubilized
protein. Thus, A8-35 has the ability to stabilize PagP against gas
phase unfolding, increasing the lifetime of native-like structures
in the gas phase reminiscent of the ability of A8-35 to stabilize
MPs against unfolding and precipitation in solution.12

Liberation of OmpT from solutions in which the protein
was solubilized
in DDM or A8-35 could also be achieved by collisionally activating
the solution-phase assemblies, with higher activation energies required
to observe resolvable protein peaks (minimally 120 V in the Trap T-wave)
than those used for PagP (Figure 3a). The ESI-IMS-MS
spectra obtained are strikingly different, with lower charge state
ions observed when OmpT is released from an A8-35 trapped state compared
with the additional higher charged ions observed in DDM. A small amount
of dimer is observed in the spectrum of DDM solubilized OmpT, due
to self-association of OmpT in the urea free solution, as has been
reported previously.70 The calculation
of CCSs from ATDs of liberated ions show both DDM and A8-35 are capable
of maintaining native-like OmpT in the gas phase (Figure 3c,d). The most lowly charged OmpT ions have measured
CCSs of 2741 Å2 in DDM (7+ charge state) and 2722
Å2 in A8-35 (5+ charge state). Both CCSs are approximately
8% smaller than that calculated from the crystal structure (3017 Å2), suggesting that a degree of conformational collapse is
occurring in the gas phase, likely in loop regions of the structure,
as has been observed for the β-barrels PagP (Figure 1) and OmpA.54,71 Increasing the collision
energy above that required to liberate the protein (up to 200 V in
the Trap T-wave) and observe a resolved mass spectrum, did not result
in a significant change in the CCS of the ions (Figure S3, Supporting Information). More expanded OmpT conformers
(those with greater charge (10+ to 16+)) were observed when liberating
the protein from DDM micelles, with the measured CCSs indicating that
multiple conformations are present (Figure 3d). This is consistent with OmpT being prone to gas phase induced
unfolding upon collisional activation of the OmpT/DDM complex. In
contrast, activation of the OmpT/A8-35 assembly results only in lowly
charged ions being observed and no ions which correspond to an unfolded
population of conformations, demonstrating that A8-35 is more adept
at stabilizing OmpT for ESI-IMS-MS analysis than DDM (even though
analysis of both DDM and A8-35 solubilized OmpT leads to some gas
phase collapse).

α-Helical Membrane-Embedded Transport
Proteins Mhp1 and
GalP
To examine the ability of A8-35 to stabilize MP structures
in the gas phase further, we investigated two α-helical membrane
transporters, Mhp1 and GalP (Figure 1c). Mhp1
is a 54.6 kDa Na+ coupled hydantoin transporter and a member
of the nucleobase-cation-symport 1 (NCS1) family of transporters which
are involved in nucleobase salvage pathways and vitamin influx.47,55 The 12 transmembrane helix bundle of Mhp1 undergoes significant
conformational changes as it transports its substrate.47,55 GalP is the 51.7 kDa galactose-H+ symporter from E. coli and is a member of the major facilitator superfamily
(MFS) of transport proteins.72−74 There is limited structural information
available for this protein49 and other
related members of the MFS; however, they are generally predicted
to comprise 12 transmembrane helices, and structures have been proposed
using homology modeling (Figure 1c).

CD was used to confirm that both Mhp1 and GalP are folded when solubilized
with either DDM or A8-35, with each spectrum exhibiting a characteristic
α-helical signal with negative maxima observed at 208 and 220
nm (Figures S4a,b and S5a,b, Supporting Information). Subtle differences in the relative intensities of the two negative
maxima were observed in the CD spectra of the DDM solubilized and
A8-35-trapped proteins, indicating that minor conformational variances
may result depending on the amphiphile used. The activities of the
DDM and A8-35 solubilized proteins were assessed using ligand binding
assays monitored by tryptophan fluorescence quenching (see Methods). The activity of Mhp1 was evaluated by
monitoring binding to l-benzylhydantoin, a known ligand,
which binds in a Na+-dependent fashion (Figure S4c,d, Supporting Information).47,55 GalP activity was assessed by monitoring binding to the small molecule
inhibitor forskolin (Figure S5c,d, Supporting
Information).75,76 Altering the amphiphile used
to solubilize the protein did not significantly affect substrate binding,
with similar Kd values determined. Together,
these data indicate that Mhp1 and GalP are both folded and functional
when solubilized with either DDM or A8-35.

Analysis of DDM and
A8-35 solubilized Mhp1 and GalP by use of ESI-IMS-MS
resulted in peaks corresponding to each MP, as well as those originating
from protein-bound lipids retained from the purification procedure
(Figures 4a,c and 5a,c).
Collision energies had to be set to much higher levels than for both
of the OMPs (with the Trap T-wave collision energy having to be raised
to 180 V) before resolvable protein peaks were observed. Both phosphatidylethanolamine
(PE) and cardiolipin (CL) were identified by lipid extraction and
further analysis by ESI-MS/MS in negative ion mode (data not shown),
common components of the E. coli inner membrane from
which the MPs were isolated.77 In the case
of the DDM solubilized proteins (Figures 4a,b
and 5a,b), a narrow range of charge states
was observed in the spectra. In contrast, a much broader range of
charge state ions was observed in the ESI-IMS-MS spectra of A8-35
solubilized Mhp1 and GalP (Figures 4c,d and 5c,d), with more lowly charged species present, indicating
the gas phase conformations of the proteins also contain more compact/folded
species. Analysis of the measured CCSs of the observed ions reinforces
this, with the lowly charged ions liberated from the A8-35 trapped
protein samples having CCSs which indicate they are of relatively
compact structure, unlike the ions observed upon analysis of the DDM
solubilized protein (Figures 4e and 5e). The lowest observed charge state ions for A8-35
trapped Mhp1 (7+) had a measured CCS of 3916 Å2, within
3.9% of the CCS predicted from the X-ray structure of the inward-open
conformer of Mhp1 (3771 Å2) (Table S1, Supporting Information). By comparison, the lowest
charge state ions observed in DDM (12+) had an ATD with two features
(Figure 4b), with the faster (or more compact)
component having a CCS of 4939 Å2, some 30% larger
than predicted (Table S1, Supporting Information). Similarly, the lowest charge state ions observed for GalP (7+)
had a measured CCS of 3028 Å2, which was only present
upon analysis of the A8-35 solubilized protein. This represents an
approximately 15% difference with the CCS of the proposed model structure
of GalP (3530 Å2). The discrepancy between these two
values could be attributed to the fact that this structure is modeled
on the homologous protein XylE or could result from structural collapse
occurring in loop regions in the gas phase. By comparison, all the
charge state ions observed in DDM had ATDs with two features, with
the lowest charge state (13+) having an ATD (Figure 5b) with a faster, more compact component having a CCS of 4657
Å2, some 50% larger than the most compact conformer
observed in the A8-35 solubilized sample (Table S1, Supporting Information).

Conclusions
Application
of noncovalent MS to probe the structure and function
of MPs presents many challenges, primarily that the target must be
solubilized with a suitable amphiphile which must be removed in the
initial stages of the MS experiment to release the MP in the gas phase.
To date, the addition of detergents has been the most common mechanism
by which MPs are purified and solubilized for analysis by noncovalent
MS,32,36,41,78 and there is much evidence that this permits the
retention of native structure in the gas phase. For example, molecular
dynamics simulations have been used to demonstrate that DDM micelles
protect gas phase structure of MPs,79 and
experimental evidence has shown that gas phase release of DDM from
a MP/detergent micelle complex promotes the stabilization of a native
structure.65 The data presented here reinforce
these observations, while further suggesting that these two phenomena
may be dependent on the specific protein or protein complex under
investigation, as well as the detergent used to solubilize the MP.41

It has been proposed that charging of
proteins takes place upon
entry into the gas phase80 and that amphiphiles
may protect the transmembrane regions of MPs from charging.81 Here, we present the first systematic, comparative
study of the behavior of α-helical and β-sheet membrane
proteins with both a detergent and an amphipol and compare gas phase
results with solution phase behavior. Our data indicate that the amphipol
A8-35 exerts a greater protective effect over the charging of MPs
compared with DDM (as in general, ions with lower charge states were
detected), which may be one reason why more native-like conformations
are observed. These observations may be attributed to the dynamic
nature of MP/detergent complexes, while A8-35 has been shown to bind
to the transmembrane regions of MPs in a quasi-irreversible fashion.12 In addition, amphipols have been shown to bind
nonspecifically to MPs and to stabilize loop regions of MPs, in contrast
with their interactions with detergents.68,82 These additional contacts of A8-35 with the soluble regions of MPs
may help to maintain their structural integrity upon collisional activation
and energy dissipation from the MP/amphiphile by evaporative cooling
upon release from A8-35.83

The strength
of the MP/A8-35 interaction may also play a role in
its ability to maintain native MP structures in the gas phase. It
is proposed that detergent removal must take place rapidly enough
to detect protein ions in the absence of bound detergent but not so
fast as to expose the native protein structure to the harsh conditions
of the collision cell for an extended period, as this may lead to
unfolding or structural collapse.83 The
multiple contacts formed between a single A8-35 molecule and the transmembrane
regions of MPs means that these interactions have very slow dissociation
rates.12 This property is fundamental to
the ability of Apols to maintain native MP structure in solution but
may also play a role in protecting the MP from unfolding in the gas
phase.

In this work, we demonstrate that the four MPs studied,
from two
different structural families, are able to adopt native, active structures
in A8-35 and that native-like ions can be observed for all these MPs
upon introduction into the gas phase from an A8-35 solubilized state.
Added to the known advantages of Apols in maintaining the structural
and functional integrity of MPs in solution for extended periods of
time,12 as well as the relative ease of
either refolding or trapping MPs in Apols, this suggests that A8-35
solubilization coupled with ESI-IMS-MS presents an attractive means
by which to characterize MPs from both structural classes. We also
show that A8-35 solubilized MPs are transferred into the gas phase
with lipid binding being maintained, thus permitting the study of
MP/lipid interactions by ESI-IMS-MS, which is fundamentally important
for attaining mechanistic insights into MP function.36 The ability of Apols to maintain both the structural and
functional integrity of MPs in both the gas and solution phases reinforces
these novel amphiphiles as a valuable addition to the toolkit to probe
MP structure using noncovalent MS techniques.
