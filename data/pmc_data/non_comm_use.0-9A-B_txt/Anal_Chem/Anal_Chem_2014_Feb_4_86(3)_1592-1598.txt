A capillary with a pulled tip, densely
packed with silica particles
of 0.47 μm in diameter, is shown to provide higher peak capacity
and sensitivity in the separation of intact proteins by reversed-phase
liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS). For
a C18 bonded phase, slip flow gave a 10-fold flow enhancement to allow
for stable nanospray with a 4-cm column length. Model proteins were
studied: ribonuclease A, trypsin inhibitor, and carbonic anhydrase,
where the latter had impurities of superoxide dismutase and ubiquitin.
The proteins were well separated at room temperature with negligible
peak tailing. The peak capacity for ubiquitin was 195 for a 10-min
gradient and 315 for a 40-min gradient based on Gaussian fitting of
the entire peak, rather than extrapolating the full-width at half-maximum.
Separation of a cell lysate with a 60 min gradient showed extremely
high peak capacities of 750 and above for a peptide and relatively
homogeneous proteins. Clean, low noise mass spectra for each model
protein were obtained. The physical widths of the peaks were an order
of magnitude narrower than those of conventional columns, giving increased
sensitivity. All proteins except ubiquitin exhibited significant heterogeneity
apparently due to multiple proteoforms, as indicated by both peak
shapes and mass spectra. The chromatograms exhibited excellent reproducibility
in retention time, with relative standard deviations of 0.09 to 0.34%.
The results indicate that submicrometer particles are promising for
improving the separation dimension of LC in top-down proteomics.

==== Body
Proteomics has been developing
rapidly over the
past 15 years since its inception,1 being
extensively used in biomarker discovery and drug development.2,3 In top-down proteomics, mass analyzers with ultrahigh resolution
are now available, such as ion cyclotron resonance, Orbitrap, and
time-of-flight, with which the molecular weight of intact proteins
can be identified with sufficient accuracy to distinguish multiple
proteoforms, which arise from post-translational modifications and
other processes.4 The ability to fragment
proteins in the mass spectrometer enables identification of the positions
of post-translational modifications,5,6 which provides
information about disease processes.7−10 For top-down proteomics, efficient separation
of the protein sample prior to mass spectrometry is critical because
biological samples contain proteins with concentrations ranging over
many orders of magnitude.11 The efficiency
of protein separations presents a major analytical challenge.12−15

Reversed-phase liquid chromatography is typically used as
at least
one dimension in top-down proteomics because it is automated and easily
interfaces with mass spectrometry (MS). The advances in column performance
have been relatively slow: for small-molecule separations, the minimum
plate heights of the three major types of reversed-phase columns,
sub-2 μm, monolithic, and porous shell, are all within a factor
of 2 of one another, with the sub-2 μm columns giving a moderately
better efficiency.16 For protein separations,
it is difficult to compare peak capacities across laboratories because
researchers choose different proteins, which have different levels
of heterogeneity. A commercial protein is generally quite impure,
consisting of multiple proteoforms. Fekete et al. used the same protein,
myoglobin, to compare many columns, showing that the best sub-2 μm
column performs comparably to the best core–shell column.17 Specifically, using ultraviolet detection, peak
capacities as high as 200 and 370 were measured for gradients of 10
and 40 min, respectively. Peak capacities are about 2-fold lower with
MS detection for a given gradient time13,18 because trifluoroacetic
acid must be used much more sparingly with MS detection due to its
suppression of ionization.19 Given the
complexity of protein samples, columns with higher peak capacities
are needed, especially for the faster gradients that are useful for
multidimensional separations.

We previously reported that capillaries
packed with 0.47 μm
particles exhibited unprecedented efficiency in reversed-phase separation
of intact proteins when injected by diffusion and detected on-column
by fluorescence microscopy.20 The silica
particles inside capillary were so homogeneously packed that eddy
diffusion was negligible,21 in contrast
to capillaries packed with particles on the micrometer scale.22 Slip flow was shown to occur in these capillaries,
which gives both an enhanced flow rate and a decreased velocity distribution
in the mobile phase.20 Injection using
a commercial nano-liquid chromatography (LC) system, combined with
gradient elution, showed that the submicrometer particles capillary
had a 5-fold higher speed and 2-fold higher resolution than did the
commercial column for intact protein separation.23 The performance of these materials has not yet been studied
for LC–MS. In this work, we investigate whether pulling the
tip of a capillary that is well packed with 0.47 μm particles
will allow a sufficient flow rate to give stable nanospray and whether
high efficiency is obtained.

Experimental Section
Preparation of Capillaries
Packed with Silica Colloidal Crystals
with Pulled Tips
The method for preparing silica colloidal
crystals was similar to the procedure described before.24 Briefly, 470 nm diameter silica particles (Nanogiant,
Temple, AZ) were calcined at 600 °C for 6 h for three times and
then annealed at 1050 °C for 3 h. After rehydroxylation in 50/50%
(v/v) nitric acid/water overnight, the particles were rinsed with
water and ethanol and finally suspended in ultrapure water to get
slurry of 30% (w/w). Fused silica capillaries of 100 μm i.d.
coated with polyimide (Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix AZ) were conditioned
by pumping 0.1 M NaOH for 15 min, followed by pumping water and ethanol
separately, each for 10 min. After drying in the vacuum oven for 30
min, the capillaries were filled with slurry prepared previously.
The colloidal crystals were formed inside the capillaries by pumping
ethanol through the capillaries under sonication. The packed capillaries
were kept at room temperature for completely dryness, which usually
takes about 3 days. After the capillaries were dry, 1–2 cm
long windows were burned on the capillary for pulling tips. Before
modification, the capillaries were placed in a 50% humidity chamber
for 30 min. The 2% methyl trichlorosilane and 16% n-octadecyltrichlorosilane (Gelest, Morrisville, PA) were dissolved
in dry toluene simultaneously, and the packed capillaries were put
into this solution at room temperature and allowed to react overnight.
After modification, the capillaries were rinsed by pumping toluene
through and then put in the oven at 120 °C for 2 h. The nanospray
tips were pulled with the P-2000 micropipet puller (Shutter Instrument,
Novato, CA) and ready for use. The bonded phase is expected to be
burned away, but since the tip is only 500 μm long, no remodification
of the silica was performed.

Reagents and Materials
Standard
proteins, ribonuclease
A from bovine pancreas, trypsin inhibitor from Glycine max (soybean) and carbonic anhydrase from bovine erythrocytes were purchased
from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO). Escherichia coli protein sample (lyophilized control sample for use in IEF applications)
was purchased from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) and dissolved in water.
An Amicon spin filter (cutoff 100k) from Millipore (Billerica, MA)
was used to remove large species in the sample. HPLC gradient acetonitrile
and water were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and used all the
time.

Nano-LC–MS
Thermo UltiMate 3000 nano LC System
was used to provide gradient elution and sample auto injection. A
Thermo LTQ Velos mass spectrometer was used as the detector. The flow
rate was 200 nL/min. A nano ESI ion source was used, and the spray
voltage was 4 kV. For gradient elution, solvent A, water with 0.5%
formic acid and 0.02% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and solvent B, acetonitrile
with 0.5% formic acid and 0.02% TFA, were used. The concentrations
of model proteins in the mixture were prepared as follows: ribonuclease
A, 0.05 mg/mL; trypsin inhibitor, 0.05 mg/mL; and carbonic anhydrase,
0.01 mg/mL. The injection volume was set to 2 nL, although it is not
quantitatively reliable below 20 nL on this instrument. The scan rate
of the mass spectrometer was set to 33.3 kDa/s and the resolution
(fwhm) was ≤0.6 Da.

Results and Discussion
The technology for using these unusually small particle sizes in
LC–MS is shown by photographs in Figure 1. A typical capillary connected to the nano-LC system through a commercial
union is pictured in Figure 1A, and the interface
between the capillary and MS is pictured in Figure 1B, where the metal union provides electrical connection. A
column length of 4.0 cm was used, which is slightly shorter than the
lengths of commercial RPLC columns, which range from 5 cm and up.
This takes advantage of the relative insensitivity on column length
for resolution of proteins in gradient elution reversed-phase liquid
chromatography, allowing higher flow rates with these submicrometer
particles. Coupling capillaries to MS usually employs an emitter with
smaller i.d for a lower limit of detection, and the optical image
of the pulled capillary tip is shown in Figure 1C. The bluish color is caused by Bragg diffraction, which demonstrates
that the particles have face-centered cubic order.24 The packing extends almost to the end of the tip, which
minimizes post column broadening.14,15,18 A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image in Figure 1D shows that the tip diameter is 12 μm, which
was found to be reproducible within a few micrometers. The SEM image
also shows that the particles were not noticeably melted in the tip-pulling
process. These pulled capillaries with fritless tips were found to
withstand the highest pressure of the instrument, 1 000 bar,
avoiding the problem of particle leakage.25 This high stability owes to the particles and walls being polymerized
together with trifunctional silanes to form a monolith.

The flow properties reveal a 10-fold enhancement from slip
flow.
Specifically, for the flow rate of 200 nL/min used for the separations
in this work, the observed back-pressure for pure water as the mobile
phase was no more than 600 bar. On the basis of the Kozeny-Carman
equation, which relates back-pressure and flow rate for the case of
no-slip,20 the back-pressure is calculated
to exceed 7 000 bar. Slip flow enhancement is a nanoscale phenomenon
that owes to the attractive interactions between mobile and stationary
phases being weak, resulting in a nonzero velocity for the fluid at
the wall and consequently an enhancement in flow rate. We previously
showed that the 470 nm particle diameter has sufficiently small interstices
to give a 5-fold slip flow enhancement for a C4 bonded phase.26 The greater hydrophobicity of the C18 bonded
phase in the present work is likely the reason for the 10-fold slip
flow enhancement. The slip flow enhancement thus enables stable nanospray
for modest UHPLC pressures.

The base peak chromatograms for
the three model proteins, ribonuclease
A, trypsin inhibitor, and carbonic anhydrase, are presented in parts
A and B of Figure 2 for a 10 min (fast) gradient
and a 40 min (slow) gradient, respectively. Additional peaks from
protein impurities in the carbonic anhydrase sample are also shown.
The presence of two of these impurities is consistent with previous
reports, which identified these as ubiquitin18 and superoxide dismutase.14,18 There is an unknown
impurity peak that elutes after carbonic anhydrase, indicated in Figure 2A,B as peak 6. There are also many smaller peaks
due to other impurities in the commercial proteins. The chromatograms
show that the model protein mixture was well resolved for both gradients,
with excellent peak shapes and signal-to-noise ratios. There is little
congestion of peaks, giving a very low baseline between most of the
peaks. As expected, the slower gradient provides higher resolution,
which is most noticeable in the crowded region in the vicinity of
peaks 5 and 6. The reproducibility of the chromatograms is detailed
in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information, showing that the RSD is no more than 0.34% for each peak.

Figure 2 Chromatograms
from LC–MS of proteins presented on three
different vertical scales for (A) a fast gradient of 1% to 70% acetonitrile
in 10 min and (B) a slow gradient of 20% to 70% acetonitrile over
40 min. Proteins: 1, ribonuclease A; 2, ubiquitin; 3, superoxide dismutase;
4, trypsin inhibitor; 5, carbonic anhydrase; 6, impurity (m = 19.554, 19.657, 19.570 Da). (C and D) Data (○)
and Gaussian fits (—) for ubiquitin peaks of chromatograms
in panels A and B, respectively. (E and F) Data (○) and Gaussian
fits (—) for carbonic anhydrase peaks from panels A and B,
respectively.

Figure 2C,D shows that the ubiquitin peaks
fit well to Gaussians for both fast and slow gradients. This indicates
unusual efficiency since protein peaks invariably tail in reversed-phase
LC. The peak widths (2σ) are shown to be quite small, 1.55 and
3.8 s for the fast and slow gradients, respectively. The peak capacity, nc, can be calculated from the peak standard
deviation. Equation 1 shows the peak capacity
depends on gradient time (wg) and the
peak width (4σ) 1  The peak capacities are calculated to be 195
and 315 for the 10 and 40 min gradients, respectively. These rival
the best peak capacities reported for the case of UV detection, although
it is difficult to compare directly because peak capacity in the latter
case was calculated from the full width at half-maximum (fwhm). 2  Equation 2 is equal
to eq 1 only for a Gaussian function. For tailing
peaks, eq 2 overestimates peak capacity. Since
the chromatograms corresponding to the peak capacities in the work
of Fekete et al. were not shown and the chromatograms that were shown
had significant tailing, a comparison cannot be made with certainty.
Alternatively, a direct comparison can be made with the results of
Roth et al. for LC–MS using porous shell particles, where the
chromatograms were shown, and furthermore, the same protein was used:
ubiquitin.18 Their ubiquitin peak is quite
asymmetric: the ratio for the trailing to leading half-widths at 10%
of the peak height is 2.0. Using the actual base width at 10% height,
rather than eq 2, the peak capacity is 70 for
the 10 min gradient. This is almost 3-fold lower than what we report
here or the same gradient. Hence the slip flow capillary provides
a significant advantage in peak capacity.

The protein peaks
in the chromatograms of Figure 2 are fraught
with impurities. These observations emphasize
that even a sample of one protein can be a mixture that is difficult
to fully resolve by reverse-phase LC. The peak that is widest and
fits most poorly to a Gaussian is that of carbonic anhydrase. This
protein has previously been reported to exhibit a shoulder on its
leading side.14 Figure 2E,F shows, respectively, that the slip-flow column nearly
resolves the shoulder for the fast gradient and gives baseline resolution
for the slow gradient. For the fast gradient, the main peak nearly
fits to a Gaussian, although there is fine structure indicating that
more than one component is present. For the slow gradient, a new shoulder
emerges and there is significant new fine structure, indicating that
many components are present. The main peak has at least four Gaussians
contributing to its shape. Three replicate chromatograms presented
in Figure S2 of the Supporting Information establish that the fine structure is reproducible rather than originating
from nanospray noise. One can conclude that the 2-fold wider peak
of carbonic anhydrase in this work and earlier work is caused mostly
by protein heterogeneity rather than column performance.

The
mass spectra for all of the proteins studied in this work are
presented in Figure 3, revealing multiple proteoforms
that are resolvable with LTQ mass spectrometer used here. The peak
for ribonuclease A is comparable in width to the peak for carbonic
anhydrase, and the mass spectrum in the first panel of Figure 3 confirms the presence of four proteoforms. The
masses of these peaks are denoted in the panel, and they differ by
amounts suggestive of varying post-translational modification. Ubiquitin
is the purest of the proteins, as proposed earlier on the basis of
its Gaussian peak shape, and the mass spectrum in the second panel
shows only one low-intensity proteoform in its mass spectrum. It is,
of course, possible that there are other proteoforms that are not
resolved by either the LTQ-MS or the chromatographic separation. The
mass spectra for superoxide dismutase and trypsin inhibitor, given
in panels 3 and 4, respectively, each show two major proteoforms.
The mass spectrum for carbonic anhydrase in panel 5 shows that there
are at least four proteoforms, and the mass spectrum for the impurity
protein, given in panel 6, shows three proteoforms. Protein heterogeneity
tends to give broader peaks and also complicates the determination
of peak capacity. In top-down proteomics, multiple separation dimensions
give complementary selectivity, such as charge, to help resolve the
multiple proteoforms.

Figure 3 Mass spectra for each of the peaks in the chromatogram
of Figure 2A. The masses for the major proteoforms,
calculated
from the charge distributions, are indicated on each mass spectrum.

The slip flow capillary has the
potential for delivering an order
of magnitude higher sensitivity because the peaks are physically sharp,
which translates to higher concentration. To illustrate, in Figure 2 the peak width (4σ) for ubiquitin is 3.1
s, and the volume follow rate is 200 nL/min; therefore, the injected
moles are contained within a volume of only 10 nL. By contrast, for
the similar separation by Roth et al.,18 the peak width (4σ) was 8.5 s, which is more than 2-fold longer
in time units, and the volume flow rate was 5-fold higher, 1 000
nL/min; therefore, the injected moles were contained within a volume
of more than 100 nL. The 10-fold smaller volume for the same number
of moles injected gives the 10-fold higher sensitivity, and this is
a consequence of the smaller physical width of the peak. Further,
our column’s inner diameter was larger, so the calculated sensitivity
factor is even greater. It is not possible to directly compare sensitivities
because the choice of mass spectrometer and capillary tip diameter
affect sensitivity. For a given system, the slip flow capillary will
deliver more than a 10-fold higher concentration to the mass spectrometer
due to the physically sharper peaks.

The high sensitivity and
large peak capacity combine to give a
wide dynamic range. This is illustrated in Figure 4, for which the same chromatograms in Figure 2 are plotted on 10× more sensitive scales. As an example,
for the fast gradient, a small peak eluting at 15 min is circled in
red in Figure 4A, and the mass spectrum for
this peak is shown in Figure 4C. The S/N ratio
is shown to be quite high, with the charge states from z = 8 to z = 13 are easily detected to reveal a mass
of 15 485 ± 8 Da. This protein elutes between superoxide
dismutase and trypsin inhibitor, and despite the fact that it is 50
to 100-fold lower in intensity than these two nearby peaks, its mass
spectrum is easily interpreted. The mass spectra for the nearby small
peaks are also easily interpreted (not shown). This illustrates that
the fast gradient gives sharp peaks for high sensitivity while still
having reasonable resolution to maintain a low baseline.

(A and B) Same chromatograms as in Figure 2 but now plotted on a 10× expanded vertical scale. (C) Mass
spectrum for the small peak in panel A that is circled in red, showing
a S/N of 10 for this peak that is 100× smaller than the peak
having maximum intensity. (D) Mass spectrum for the small peak in
panel B that is circled in red, showing little contribution from the
100× larger carbonic anhydrase peak to which it is adjacent.

Slower gradients offer another
advantage: resolving peaks where
there is congestion in the chromatogram. In Figure 4B, for the slow gradient, a small peak eluting at 35 min is
circled in red, and its mass spectrum is shown in Figure 4D. Despite the fact that this small peak is adjacent
to the main carbonic anhydrase peak and it is only 1.8% of the height
of the carbonic anhydrase peak, Figure 4D shows
that there is little signal from carbonic anhydrase. The mass spectrum
indicates that this peak is comprised of three proteoforms of an unknown
protein, with mass differences suggestive of different post-translational
modifications. The ability to detect such minority peaks is useful
in conjunction with multidimensional separations, where the protein
background would be low.

To investigate the application of the
slip flow capillary to a
very complex sample, the water-soluble fraction of an E. coli protein mixture was studied. Figure 5 shows
the base-peak chromatogram for a 60 min gradient elution. The early
eluting species that give sharp peaks in the vicinity of 9–12
min are peptides. The later eluting species are proteins, which give
broader peaks due to multiple proteoforms. Three regions of the chromatogram
were analyzed further by using extracted-ion chromatograms to find
proteins that could reasonably be distinguished from the different
proteoforms within the moderate resolving power of the LTQ mass spectrometer.
The EIC for a peak eluting at 10.5 min is shown in Figure 5 to fit well to a Gaussian with a standard deviation
0.019 min. For the 60-min gradient, this width gives a computed peak
capacity of 790. The mass spectrum shows a single peak m/z = 949.4, indicating that this is a peptide. The
EIC for a peak eluting at 28.4 min showed a less homogeneous species,
for which the tallest peak fit to a similar standard deviation, giving
a computed peak capacity of 750. The mass spectrum indicates that
this is from a protein of 9.7 kDa in mass. For elution times after
40 min, the base-peak chromatogram becomes quite congested because
of the multiplicity of proteoforms for the higher molecular weight
proteins. Among these, the EIC for a peak eluting at 56.0 min for
a lower molecular weight species is shown in Figure 5 to have several overlapped peaks. The Gaussian fit gives
an estimated peak width also of 0.02 min, again giving a computed
peak capacity of 750. The mass spectrum shows this species either
to be a peptide of mass 1744.9 Da or, more likely, a protein of mass
12.2 kDa. The results thus show that the efficiency is still high
even in the presence of congestion for these late eluting proteins.
A higher resolution mass spectrometer combined with this capillary
would likely alleviate much of the congestion in the extracted-ion
chromatograms. While the peaks are very sharp, in time units they
are 2.6 s wide (fwhm), which is ample for a higher resolution mass
spectrometer, such as the Orbitrap.

Figure 5 Base-peak chromatogram of a cell lysate
over a 60 min gradient
is shown in the bottom panel. The arrows point to extracted-ion chromatograms
(EIC) on expanded scales for three narrow peaks: early eluting (10.5
min), intermediate eluting (28.4 min), and late eluting (56.0 min).
The standard deviations (σ) are shown on the EIC plots, and
each is based on a Gaussian fit (red curve) to one or more peaks in
the extracted-ion chromatogram. The mass spectrum is also shown for
each of the three peaks, where the m/z with the highest signal was used in each case to generate the extracted-ion
chromatogram. Gradient conditions: 20–55% acetonitrile over
60 min, with 0.5% formic acid and 0.02% TFA.

Conclusions
Slip flow imparts sufficient flow rates for
submicrometer particles
to be used for improving efficiency and sensitivity in reversed-phase
LC–MS of intact proteins. Very high peak capacities are generated.
