Localized
surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) represents a sensitive and versatile
method for detection of biomolecules in a label-free fashion, but
identification of bound analytes can be challenging with LSPR alone,
especially for samples in a complex medium. We report the fabrication
of an optically active, plasmonic film of gold nanoparticles by using
a self-assembly and calcination process, which offers orthogonal measurements
enabling multifaceted characterization on the same surface with LSPR
and surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry.
This proof-of-concept study involves plasmonic characterization of
the fabricated nanofilm, real-time monitoring of vesicle–surface
interactions toward formation of fluid lipid bilayer, and mass spectrometric
analysis of peptides and cytochrome c digest. This multifunction-enabling
surface material can yield complementary analytical information, providing
new tools for comprehensive analysis of biomolecular samples.

==== Body
The development
of highly integrated, multifunctional biosensing platforms is of great
importance to the fields of environmental monitoring, toxicity screenings,
proteomics, and drug discovery.1 In particular,
localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) has gained considerable
attention as an effective signal transducer due to its sensitivity
and versatility.2 LSPR is an optical phenomenon
associated with nanomaterials and is typically monitored by changes
in the extinction spectra, as LSPR results in strong light absorbing
and scattering properties. These properties are influenced by the
shape, size, and composition of the nanostructure, making LSPR materials
highly tunable.3,4 Compared to the vast literature
of solution-based detection, solid-state LSPR sensing comprises only
a small portion, yet the fabrication processes remain an active research
topic. These processes include top down techniques such as e-beam
lithography,5 focused ion beam lithography,6 nanosphere lithography,7 and colloidal lithography,8,9 in addition to bottom
up methods, largely dominated by layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition from
colloidal solutions.10,11 The LbL method is attractive
toward fabricating LSPR substrates, as it allows for nanometer scale
control of the substrate without the need of expensive cleanroom equipment,
making reproducible substrates accessible to a large audience.12 Despite its sensitivity and versatility, LSPR
as a label-free method for the characterization of biomolecular interactions
faces the challenge of distinguishing nonspecific binding in its measurements.

Thus, adding another dimension of measurement to these nanomaterials
would significantly improve interaction studies, especially with methods
that yield chemical and structural information. Mass spectrometry,
capable of sophisticated tasks such as sequencing DNA and proteins,13 has been linked to LSPR substrates, as metallic
nanostructures such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) may directly absorb
UV laser light and function in place of an organic matrix during laser
desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI-MS).14 Therefore, considerable effort has been placed on preparing
nanostructure assemblies that function as surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization
(SALDI) platforms.15−17 SALDI is advantageous as it reduces sample preparation for MS and
is more amenable to small molecule and drug screening analyses, where
matrix-related ions may convolute experimental spectra. However, formation
of gold structures that promote desorption/ionization generally compromises
the optical properties of the nanoparticles intrinsic in their dispersed
states and little success has been made in performing LSPR biosensing
and in situ SALDI-MS on the same substrate.

In this work, we
report the use of the LbL method combined with our previously established
calcination process18,19 (Figure 1) to generate a glass-coated and optically active monolayer film
of gold nanoparticles for the detection and identification of biomolecules,
as well as characterization of biophysical processes. Developing cross-platform
sensing materials poses many challenges in that different techniques
require varying optimized conditions in their respective materials.
Figure 1 shows the scheme we used for fabricating
an ultrathin film for dual-mode LSPR and SALDI-MS analysis. Three
parameters were principally optimized during the fabrication process:
(a) number of layers of AuNPs, (b) conditions leading to dense packing,
and (c) realization of an ultrathin silicate coating. We chose a monolayer
configuration of AuNPs for the nanofilm due to the fact that single
layer films show fewer nanoscale inconsistencies across the surface.10,19 These nanoparticles needed to be densely packed in order to generate
small nanogaps and crevices where heat would concentrate during the
LDI-MS process.20 In order to create a
densely packed structure, we used a long-chain polyelectrolyte to
aggregate multiple nanoparticles via a bridging flocculation effect.21 Finally, the entire film was coated with an
ultrathin layer of silicate glass which not only adds functionality18 but also thermally insulates the gold, which
is ideal for heat confinement and promoting desorption/ionization
in SALDI-MS.19 The substrate was calcinated
at 450 °C, in which high temperature combusts the sacrificial
polymer layers used to electrostatically immobilize the nanoparticles
and creates a dense network of silicate. While the thickness of this
silicate film may be tuned by altering the number of PAH/silicate
layers, we chose to add only one layer of silicate for a final thickness
of ca. 2 nm,18 as this would still allow
for plasmonic sensing to occur beyond the thin layer of silicate glass.3,22

SEM characterization confirms a monolayer structure
with AuNPs aggregating in different states, consisting mostly of dimer
and trimer morphologies, with some larger aggregates. AFM further
reveals an average thickness of 26.1 ± 5.7 nm, consistent with
the monolayer arrangement of aggregates and proving that a precisely
controlled self-assembled nanoparticle substrate can be obtained using
our approach (Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting
Information). SEM images also confirm the film robustness offered
by the nanosilicate coating, as calcination of the AuNP film without
the protective layer resulted in destructive thermal annealing of
nanoparticles and loss of plasmonic activity (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). The calcinated AuNP
film displays well-defined absorption spectra and good LSPR sensitivity
for spherical nanoparticles, with a bulk sensitivity of 84 ±
10 nm/RIU obtained with different solvents (Figure 2a), which is equivalent to that of other reported solid-bound
AuNP structures.23 The differential extinction
spectrum approach was employed for data analysis so that refractive
index sensitivities may be evaluated at any given wavelength, rather
than limited at the extinction peaks.24 For calcinated monolayer AuNPs, we observed that wavelengths higher
than the initial peak display higher sensitivities, with the sensitivity
of 0.106 NEU/RIU at 570 nm increasing to 0.497 NEU/RIU at 600 nm (Figure 2b).Figure 2 Characterization of LSPR performance with calcinated AuNP

The addition of a nanosilicate coating via LbL/calcination
appends new functionality not typically seen in other LSPR substrates.
Different from metal substrates that generally suppress bilayer formation,25,26 lipid bilayers are readily formed on silicate glass, which provides
a hydrophilic surface that allows phospholipid vesicles to rupture,
fuse, and self-assemble.18 To demonstrate
this feature and assess LSPR surface sensitivity, interactions of
phosphatidylcholine vesicles and formation of a lipid bilayer on the
surface from a bulk vesicle suspension were investigated (Figure 2c). The differential extinction spectra in Figure 2c show that this surface interaction shifts the
AuNP absorbance to the greater extent at higher wavelengths, while
there is no change across the entire spectrum when immersed only in
water. When the normalized extinction spectrum at 725 nm is plotted
against time, a kinetic curve can be obtained that shows that the
bilayer formation process reaches a plateau in about an hour, which
is slower than previous studies on calcinated flat gold substrates.18,27 This has been attributed to the rough surface of the nanoparticles
themselves. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was
performed to confirm this, as well as to provide verification that
the bilayer was continuous and mobile. Using previously established
methods,28 a diffusion coefficient of 2.95
μm2/s was obtained, along with a mobile fraction
value of 0.86. Fluorescence images show that supported bilayer membrane
covers the entire nanofilm surface, with scattered areas of higher
fluorescence intensity indicative of defect spots (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). While the mobile fraction
value was lower than 1, the diffusion coefficient agrees with those
of lipid bilayers on other glassy surfaces, which range from 1 to
4 μm2/s.29 These data
suggest that the slow formation may be the result of a poor fusion
process of lipid vesicles on the rough nanoparticle substrate, yielding
a complex bilayer structure. The mobility of lipids in defect spots
is restricted, leading to slightly lower mobile fraction value. However,
the observed high lateral mobility after extensive incubation is comparable
to those of other uniform glass surfaces, rendering the calcinated
nanofilm suitable for studies where a natural lipid membrane environment
is necessary for function.

It is interesting to note that this
solid state AuNP film showed very different transmission properties
compared to those of other AuNP films,30 as well as monodisperse AuNPs of the same size in solution. While
this is largely due to the local aggregation of nanoparticles, we
sought to understand how neighboring structures plasmonically coupled
and contributed to observed experimental results. Finite-difference
time-domain (FDTD) simulations were carried out with a number of packing
morphologies based on SEM and a 2 nm silica coating. Results indicated
that the optical properties of this film were largely reflective of
arrayed dimer and trimer morphologies (Figure 3). For instance, the primary peak of the simulated dimer array matches
closely with the left shoulder peak of the experimental substrate
(at λ = 530), in addition to the primary peak of both the trimer
array and experimental substrate (both at λ = 560–570
nm). It appears that the calcination step promotes reproducible structures
(dimer and trimer morphologies) that manifest in consistent experimental
results (i.e., similar extinction bands and RI sensitivities). In
addition, the strong coupling of neighboring nanostructures unique
in the solid state leads to plasmonic properties responsible for LSPR
sensitivity, which may also be useful for other types of surface enhancement.

Gold nanoparticles have shown excellent performance in place
of traditional MALDI-MS matrices due to their broad absorption, which
ranges from UV to the visible regions.14 To demonstrate matrix-free SALDI-MS analysis with the calcinated
AuNP film, ionization of two peptides, [Sar1, Thr8]-angiotensin II and neurotensin, was investigated (Figure 4a). When 2 pmol of each peptide was ionized on the
AuNP film, comparable results were obtained to MALDI that uses CHCA
as a matrix (Figure S4a in the Supporting Information). Citric acid was added to all samples as it does not absorb UV
light but is capable of donating protons to promote the formation
of [M + H]+ cations. The [M + H]+ peaks can
be readily distinguished in both spectra, and background noise is
very low. There are also no gold clusters evident in the spectra,
which has been an issue for some similar work using AuNPs as SALDI-MS
substrates.14−16 This can be attributed to the calcinated silicate
layer, which offers protection of the AuNPs and anchors them to the
surface during the LDI process. Furthermore, the calcinated silicate
film has a low thermal conductivity and assists in confining heat
to localized areas, promoting desorption from the surface and increasing
LDI performance.19

spectrum of the same cytochrome c digest with CHCA used as matrix.

Further MS characterization was
carried out with a tryptic digest of cytochrome c, which yields more
information about the nanofilm performance for proteomic studies (Figure 4b). Comparable results for 80 pmol of cytochrome
c digest are obtained between SALDI and MALDI, though the SALDI results
detected one less peptide (Table S1 in the Supporting
Information). However, the CHCA matrix yielded abundant background
noise in comparison to the AuNP film (Figure 4c), and S/N ratios for many peaks were lower using CHCA, possibly
due to LDI suppression of target analytes by matrix ions. This is
clearly shown in the higher relative intensities of C6, C7, and C10
peaks at 965, 1169, and 1634 m/z, respectively, in the calcinated AuNP spectrum. Intact cytochrome
c was also detectable on the calcinated AuNP film (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information), showing that the calcinated
nanofilm of AuNPs enables mass spectrometric measurement of a reasonably
large mass range of substrates, from peptides to small proteins, and
is thus applicable to broad analysis beyond only small molecules.

Using the AuNP film fabricated by LbL self-assembly and calcination,
we have demonstrated a multifunctional surface that is compatible
with several important analytical methods. The intended properties
of a monolayer of AuNPs, dense packing structure, and calcinated silicate
coating were each realized, and they have contributed to the dual-mode
sensing functionality of LSPR and SALDI-MS. Furthermore, the LbL process
allows for these properties to be easily tailored in a consistent
and reproducible fashion. These results clearly demonstrate the potential
of a unique nanofilm substrate on which multiple, in situ measurements
are possible and thus an array of complementary information, quantitative
and structural, is obtainable. Given that LSPR is a label-free technique,
the combined function of multiple detections may lead to highly efficient
bioassays that rely on orthogonal methods using the same sample on
the same chip, vastly decreasing time and cost in the characterization
of biological systems and environmental samples.
