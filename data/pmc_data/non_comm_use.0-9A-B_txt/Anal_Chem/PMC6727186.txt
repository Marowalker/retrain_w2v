In
the past decade, the development of single particle–inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SP-ICPMS) has revolutionized the
field of nanometallomics. Besides differentiation between dissolved
and particulate metal signals, SP-ICPMS can quantify the nanoparticle
(NP) number concentration and size. Because SP-ICPMS is limited to
characterization of NPs in solution, we show how solid sampling by
laser ablation (LA) adds spatial-resolution characteristics for localized
NP analysis in biomaterials. Using custom-made gelatin standards doped
with dissolved gold and commercial or synthesized gold nanoparticles,
LA-SP-ICPMS conditions such as laser fluence, beam size, and dwell
time were optimized for NP analysis to minimize NP degradation, peak
overlap, and interferences from dissolved gold. A data-processing
algorithm to retrieve the NP number concentration and size was developed
for this purpose. As a proof-of-concept, a sunflower-root-sample cross-section,
originating from a sunflower plant exposed to gold NPs, was successfully
imaged using the optimized LA-SP-ICPMS conditions for localized NP
characterization.

With the
growing use of nanoparticles
(NPs) in different fields such as energy production,1 biology, medicine,2,3 and consumer goods,4 more and more concerns have been raised about
their safety.5 Because living systems have
different uptake mechanisms for NPs compared to dissolved species,6,7 potential risks exist for human health through inhalation exposure
and dermal exposure.8 Growing awareness
has led to a sharp increase in NP studies and development of methods
for the measurement of NPs.9 Methods such
as atomic-force microscopy (AFM),10 scanning
electron microscopy (SEM),11 secondary-ion
mass spectrometry (SIMS),12 transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS),13,14 and single particle–inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
(SP-ICPMS) are frequently used to characterize NPs.

The last
method has become a well-established method for simultaneous
determination of particle size and number concentration.15,16 However, a limitation of this technique is that solid samples that
contain NPs have to be dissolved and subsequently suspended for analysis.
Thus, the spatial-distribution information on particles in solid samples
is lost, and the experimenter runs the risk of affecting the integrity
of the particles during sample preparation. LA-ICPMS can be used to
measure the spatial distribution of nanoparticles in biological tissues17−19 or serve as a technique to monitor NP-tagged antibodies.20 NPs have even been sized by thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) and measured by LA-ICPMS.21 However,
individual NPs were identified in none of these papers; to our knowledge,
only Donard et al.22 have shown the detection
of discrete, single NP events upon ablation of a solid material.

This work focuses on the development of an LA-SP-ICPMS method for
nanoparticle analysis in biomaterials and on defining the limitations
of the method for the measurement of NPs. Custom-made gelatin standards
containing commercial or synthesized gold NPs of various sizes and
with different number concentrations were used to optimize the conditions
for measurement of gold NPs. By increasing the dissolved-gold concentration,
we established the method’s sizing threshold because nanoparticles
are always generated upon ablation of dissolved species. LA-SP-ICPMS
conditions such as laser-beam size, laser fluence, and dwell time
were varied to optimize the method.

The optimized method was
used to measure gold-NP size, number concentration,
and localization in roots of sunflower plants grown hydroponically
with gold NPs added.

Experimental Section
Gold-Nanoparticle Synthesis
and Characterization
Gold
NPs of progressively increasing diameter were synthesized using a
modified Turkevich method23,24 by reduction of Au3+ in an aqueous solution of HAuCl4 with trisodium
citrate. By consecutively growing the particles and controlling the
reaction conditions, nine particle sizes with diameters from ∼20
to ∼100 nm were synthesized. Mean diameters of the synthesized
particles were determined by routine methods using dynamic light scattering
(DLS, Zetasizer Nano ZS, Malvern, Almelo, Netherlands) and SP-ICPMS
(Single Nanoparticle Analysis Module, Agilent 7900, Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA) yielding the following nine sizes (mean ± SD):
26 ± 5, 33 ± 5, 37 ± 6, 40 ± 5, 47 ± 6, 54
± 6, 65 ± 8, 80 ± 9, and 86 ± 9 nm. Gold-NP standards
with mean sizes of 20 nm (7.00 × 1011 particles mL–1), 40 nm (9.00 × 1010 particles mL–1), 60 nm (2.60 × 1010 particles mL–1), and 100 nm (5.60 × 109 particles
mL–1), all with less than 8% variability, from BBI
Solutions (Cardiff, U.K.) were used in the characterization of the
synthesized gold NPs. NPs were diluted in ultrapure deionized water
prior to measurement. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, ARM 200
CF, Jeol, Akishima, Japan) was used to investigate the morphology
of the NPs synthesized.

Preparation of Gelatin Standards for NP Analysis
Preparation
of homogeneous NP standards for LA-SP-ICPMS analysis was carried out
by suspending gold NPs, commercially obtained or custom-synthesized,
in 10% (m/v) gelatin (porcine-skin gelatin, type A, bloom strength
300, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) by ultrasonication for 1 min. The
gelatin was heated to 55 °C prior to the addition of the gold
NPs and then drop-casted on a glass microscope slide, after which
the gelatin droplets were dried in a convection oven at 100 °C
for 1 h, similar to an earlier reported method for preparation of
dissolved (elemental) standards.25Supporting Information Section 1 (SI-1) demonstrates
the homogeneous distribution of NPs in the gelatin standards.

Cultivation
of Plants in NP-Spiked Hydroponics and Root-Sample
Preparation
Sunflower seeds were sterilized in 10% H2O2 and planted in vermiculite. After 10 days, 5
cm seedlings were transferred to tubes containing 100 mL of Hoagland
solution. After 1 week of adjustment in hydroponics, 10 plants were
exposed for 8 days to gold NPs (60 nm gold NPs, 1.83 × 109 NP mL–1, citrate stabilized, <12% variability,
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in 100 mL of Hoagland solution. As controls,
10 plants were grown in Hoagland solution without NPs. Sunflowers
were kept in a growing chamber at 22 °C with a 16/8 day–night
photoperiod and 60% humidity. SI-2 gives
the anatomical cross-sectional structure of a sunflower root. At the
end of the experiment, the plants were taken from the tubes, and the
roots were rinsed with distilled water. The rootlets were detached
from the plant, inserted in a stainless-steel needle, and flash-frozen
in propane cooled with liquid nitrogen.26 Subsequently, the roots were cryotomed (cryostat Leica CM5030S,
Wetzlar, Germany) to 20 μm thick slices, deposited on parafilm,
and freeze-dried (Alpha 2-4, Martin Christ Gefriertrocknungsanlagen,
Osterode am Harz, Germany).

LA-SP-ICPMS Instrument and Operating Conditions
for NP Analysis
All NP-analysis measurements were conducted
with an Analyte G2,
193 nm ArF* LA instrument (Teledyne Photon Machines Inc., Bozeman,
MT) with a two-volume ablation cell (HelEx II; He carrier gas flow
rate, cup = 0.5 l min–1, cell = 0.3 l min–1). The LA unit was interfaced with an ICPMS instrument (Agilent 7900,
Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The ICPMS was operated in
time-resolved analysis mode with a dwell time of 100 μs, acquiring
the mass of 197Au. A typical gold-nanoparticle event in
the ICPMS lasts ca. 500 μs;27 the
minimum selectable dwell time of 100 μs was chosen to record
this transient signal. When the sensitivity of the ICPMS is adequate,
this gives us sufficient resolution to distinguish a double event,
in which two particles are recorded, from a single event. Furthermore,
it allows measurement of single NPs in an LA-packet densely packed
with NPs originating from a HelEx II laser-ablation cell. Gelatin
NP standards and sunflower-root-sample cross-sections were subjected
to laser ablation via a line-scan routine.

An NP-analysis protocol
was developed for retrieval of the NP number concentration and size
by optimizing the laser-ablation conditions using the NP standards.
To this end, LA-SP-ICPMS conditions were varied as follows: fluence,
0.5–4 J cm–2; laser-beam size, 10–85
μm (round or square mask); and dwell time, 100–1000 μs.
Because NPs are also generated upon ablation of dissolved species
in the matrix, we studied the influence of the dissolved-gold concentration
on the detection of gold NPs to establish a sizing threshold. Additionally,
mixed NP standards with three NP sizes were used to prove the performance
of the NP-analysis protocol for accurate NP sizing.

The optimized
laser-ablation conditions for the sunflower-root
cross-sections were as follows (for ablation of the complete thickness):
beam diameter, 5 μm (square mask); scanning speed, 25 μm
s–1; fluence, 0.4 J cm–2; repetition
rate, 50 Hz; and dwell time, 100 μs. These conditions imply
that laser ablation took place every 0.5 μm along the line during
line scanning; by gathering the total counts in every subsequent 10
shots (i.e., the total counts in 2000 data points), a conventional
gold map resulted with a pixel size of 5 × 5 μm2. By more detailed processing of the data, each time-resolved peak
in the line scan can be associated with a single nanoparticle, with
the height of the peak corresponding to the particle mass or particle
size. Thus, not only the distribution of gold in the tissue can be
derived but also the particle number concentration and size at a particular
location.

Data Processing
The raw time-resolved-analysis data
from ablation of the gelatin NP standards and sunflower-root-sample
cross-sections were processed with Origin software (Origin 2018, OriginLab
Corporation, Northampton, MA). Line-scan data were subjected to peak
analysis by integration of individual peaks, followed by creation
of a histogram using the peak areas. The histogram shows us the presence
of dissolved species and how many different NP sizes are present;
the number of peaks for a certain NP size is indicative of the particle
number concentration. When the dissolved-gold concentration increases,
NP analysis of small NPs becomes a problem (see the Results and Discussion section). Histograms can be created
from a complete line scan, a fraction of a line scan, or even a single
laser-ablation shot when enough NP peaks are generated per shot. Thus,
the NP number concentration in the standards or root sample determines
what kind of spatial resolution is possible in element maps with regard
to NP sizing, as enough NP-detection events (>200) are essential
to
produce a suitable histogram for retrieval of the NP size. Selection
of the proper bin size in the histograms is critical for proper fitting
of the data with a log-normal distribution curve; we used the Shimazaki
and Shinomoto method for bin-size optimization, as this method does
not require assumptions about the distribution function.28 The centers of the fitted log-normal distribution
curves correspond to the mean sizes of the gold NPs. SI-3 gives a schematic overview of the data-processing workflow.

Results and Discussion
Concept of NP Analysis by LA-SP-ICPMS
The raw data
collected by LA-SP-ICPMS requires substantial processing and an in-depth
understanding of the events occurring both during the laser-ablation
process and in the ICPMS detection step. Figure 1 illustrates the concept of NP analysis in
biomaterials, from ablation to detection to processing. A single line
scan is shown along which single “squares”, associated
with pulses from a laser beam with a square mask, are subjected to
NP analysis. The highlighted square contains dissolved species and
NPs of two sizes, all correlated with the same element. The diameter
of NP1 is twice the diameter of NP2, but their particle number concentration
is the same. The ICPMS trace, recorded with a dwell time of 100 μs,
shows the background generated by the dissolved species and the two
different particle sizes, as evidenced from the peaks with roughly
two different heights (the average height ratio is 8 as a result of
cubic conversion of NP size to mass). The numbers of peaks for the
different sizes are similar because of their equal number concentrations.
After subtraction of the dissolved-species background from the raw
signal, integration of all peaks, counting of peaks, and sorting of
peaks by incidence, a histogram is created showing the three possible
particle sizes: (from left to right) dissolved species, NP2, and NP1.

Figure 1 Concept
of NP analysis in biomaterials using LA-SP-ICPMS. Homogeneously
distributed dissolved species are represented by a green background,
whereas the two different NP sizes are shown as red (diameter of d) and blue (diameter of d/2) dots.

The individual histograms are
fitted with log-normal distributions,
as modeling has shown that particles are not monodisperse but follow
a log-normal distribution based on a kinetic approach, assuming normally
distributed times for growth and destruction of particles.29 The positions of the individual peaks (μ)
correspond to the mean particle sizes (given in peak-area units, i.e.,
counts). The particle number concentration can be retrieved from the
cumulated incidences for each NP size divided by the detection-efficiency
factor (DEF), which takes into account the losses induced by ablation,
transport, atomization ionization, and counting. This detection-efficiency
factor can be defined as DEF = (mean number of particles per shot
detected by SP-ICPMS)/(mean number of particles per shot in the mass
ablated). The number of particles per shot in the mass ablated is
calculated from the area ablated × depth × matrix density
× particle number concentration. The area ablated is associated
with the beam size, and the average depth per pulse on gelatin is
156 ± 7 nm, as measured by confocal microscopy. Using Figure 1 as a guideline,
a number of parameters (laser fluence, laser-beam size, dissolved-species
concentration, and dwell time) were varied for optimization of the
NP-analysis protocol using NP standards.

Influence of Various LA-SP-ICPMS
Parameters on NP Analysis
To find the optimal laser fluence
for analysis of NPs (i.e., with
minimal degradation of the particles and thus negligible effect on
the mean particle size), NP standards containing 40 nm gold particles
in gelatin were subjected to line scanning with various fluences.
From the histograms in SI-4, it can be
seen how a higher fluence not only leads to an increase of the total
number of NPs detected but also to a shift to smaller, degraded NPs.
The mean size of the original NPs does not seem to change much with
increasing fluence. However, with increasing fluence, the dip between
the smaller, degraded particles and the original NPs becomes less
and less pronounced, indicating the formation of a range of NP sizes.
This is further illustrated in Figure 2 where the ratio between smaller, degraded NPs and
original NPs is plotted against the fluence. It is clear that a low
fluence (⩽ 1 J cm–2) needs to be used for
NP analysis to minimize degradation of NPs and to retrieve the correct
mean particle size.

Figure 2 Partial conversion of 40 nm gold nanoparticles in gelatin
(NPorig) to smaller, degraded nanoparticles (NPdegr) as a function of the laser fluence.

Using an adequate laser fluence, ablation of NPs initially
present
in biomaterials leads to the release of intact NPs (i.e., NPs that
are incorporated in the broad range of nano- to microparticles30 generated upon ablation of the matrix). This
implies that upon increasing the laser-beam size, more similarly sized
intact NPs are released from the matrix. This is illustrated in Figure 3, showing how the
laser-beam size (10, 20, 35, 50, and 85 μm, round mask) influences
the number of NPs detected by the ICPMS and their mean size upon ablation
of a gelatin standard with 40 nm gold NPs and a NP number concentration
of 9.0 × 1010 g–1. As expected,
the number of particles detected is linearly proportional to the area
ablated per laser pulse, whereas the mean particle size stays roughly
the same. The detection-efficiency factor, DEF, calculated from the
ratio of the number of NPs detected by the ICPMS and the number of
NPs contained in the volume ablated, is 0.19 ± 0.07. In principle,
a reduction of the beam size can serve as a “dilution”
and thus a straightforward way to avoid detection of double peaks.
The same effect may be obtained by reducing the repetition rate (data
not shown).

Figure 3 Numbers of NPs and their mean sizes per laser-ablation pulse as
detected by ICPMS upon ablation of a gelatin standard containing 40
nm gold NPs with a number concentration of 9.0 × 1010 g–1 as a function of the area ablated per pulse.
Areas are associated with beam sizes of 10, 20, 35, 50, and 85 μm
(round mask).

Laser ablation of dissolved
species involves the creation of many
small NPs, in contrast to laser ablation of NPs, in which the NPs
are merely released from the biomaterial. When the number concentration
of NPs initially present in the biomatrix increases, the peak density
detected by ICPMS increases, whereas the peak height and area stay
the same. When the dissolved-species concentration in the biomatrix
increases, the mean NP size of the particles generated is affected
negligibly. However, the mean dissolved-species concentration increases
proportionally with the dissolved-species concentration, leading to
a higher background. Thus, at higher dissolved-species concentrations
in biomatrices, the detection of NPs may be negatively affected when
the “background noise” caused by the dissolved species
cannot be differentiated from the NP signals, leading to inaccurate
NP analysis. Figure 4 shows (zoomed-in) raw line-scan data for gelatin standards containing
10, 20, and 50 μg g–1 dissolved gold and for
gelatin standards containing 26 and 37 nm gold nanoparticles. It is
evident that the presence of 50 μg g–1 dissolved
gold may already start influencing the measurement of the smaller
NPs of 26 nm. However, because the results in Figure 4 are based on laser ablation with a 35 μm
beam size (square mask), dilution by reducing the beam size will not
affect the heights or areas of the NP peaks, but the dissolved-species
signal will decrease in a squared fashion associated with the area
ablated. However, this dilution step will affect the peak density,
so the particle number concentration in the gelatin needs to be sufficiently
high to perform this step. If for this reason dilution is not possible,
a threshold needs to be established on the basis of 5 standard deviations
of the dissolved-species signal.31 In Figure 4, this would mean
thresholds of 71 000, 105 000, and 202 000 cps
for the respective dissolved-species concentrations of 10, 20, and
50 μg g–1. These thresholds would then serve
as baseline signals to be extracted from the NP peak signals prior
to integration. For real-world applications where materials with inhomogeneously
distributed dissolved species are ablated, we determined the threshold
by applying a median filter across the entire line scan; this was
followed by calculating the threshold on the basis of counting statistics
in each median data point, P, associated with the
counts in the integration window: P + 5√P.

Figure 4 Raw (zoomed-in) line-scan data for gelatin standards containing
10, 20, and 50 μg g–1 dissolved gold (A) and
gelatin standards containing 26 and 37 nm gold nanoparticles (B).

One of the critical LA-SP-ICPMS
parameters for NP analysis is the
dwell time22,32 (i.e., the integration window
the ICPMS uses to accumulate counts). Especially when the NP number
concentration is high, and no further instrumental dilution is possible,
the probability to encounter more than one peak in the integration
window increases, and inaccurate NP analysis ensues.33 To show this effect, a gelatin standard with 40 nm gold
NPs and a NP number concentration of 9.0 × 1010 g–1 was ablated (beam size, 85 μm (round mask);
repetition rate, 20 Hz; scanning speed, 40 μm s–1), and the counts associated with 197Au were accumulated
with integration windows of 100, 500, and 1000 μs. In Figure 5, the histograms
obtained after extraction of the NP-sizing data associated with the
line scans on the gelatin are shown for the different integration
windows. It is evident from the histograms that at least two NP sizes
are recorded for dwell times of 500 and 1000 μs, the second
peak as a result of false-positive detection of two NP events that
cannot be distinguished in postprocessing. From fitting, it follows
that the areas associated with these two sizes are 87 and 13% (for
a dwell time of 500 μs) and 72 and 28% (for a dwell time of
1000 μs); that is, the probabilities of recording a double NP
event are 13% (500 μs) and 28% (1000 μs). The mean of
the fitted double peaks occurs at ca. twice the integrated peak area
for dwell times of 500 and 1000 μs.

Figure 5 NP sizing for different
dwell times upon ablation of a gelatin
standard containing NPs with a mean size of 40 nm and a particle number
concentration of 9.0 × 1010 g–1.
The histogram for 100 μs was fitted with a log-normal distribution.
For dwell times of 500 and 1000 μs, we performed peak deconvolution
to show the increased likelihood of false-positive detection events
(double peaks) with increasing dwell time.

SI-5 shows how sizing of the nine
synthesized
NP gelatin standards by LA-SP-ICPMS compares with sizing of the nine
synthesized NP aqueous standards by routine solution SP-ICPMS. A linear
relationship is observed, implying that the developed LA-SP-ICPMS
NP-sizing method is able to produce accurate results. TEM analysis
of one of the synthesized NPs (26 μm) shows the morphology of
these particles. To verify whether or not mixed NP sizes can be distinguished,
a gelatin standard containing synthesized gold NPs with mean sizes
of 86, 47, and 26 nm and respective particle number concentrations
of 3.2 × 105, 4.2 × 105, and 3.1 ×
106 g–1 was subjected to NP sizing using
the optimized LA-SP-ICPMS parameters. From Figure 6, it can be seen that these NPs can indeed
be separated in a mixed standard, with mean particle sizes matching
those of the individual NP standards, enhancing the applicability
of this NP-analysis method for real samples. In SI-6, we calculated that under these conditions of virtually
no dissolved gold, the minimum NP size measurable was ca. 15 nm.

Figure 6 NP sizing
of a mixture of synthesized gold NPs in gelatin with
mean sizes of 86, 47, and 26 nm and respective particle number concentrations
of 3.2 × 105, 4.2 × 105, and 3.1 ×
106 NP g–1. Different optimized bin sizes
were used in the three histograms.

Demonstration of LA-SP-ICPMS NP Analysis in Real Samples
Root cross-sections originating from sunflower plants exposed to
gold NPs with a mean size of 60 nm were subjected to LA-SP-ICPMS NP
analysis. The whole root cross-section was analyzed via the method
optimized above with the conditions given in the Experimental Section. Parallel, adjoining line scans (100
in total) with 307 000 data points per line scan where manipulated
in ImageJ 1.52h34 to yield a conventional
gold map with a pixel size of 5 × 5 μm2. Figure 7 shows that gold
is mainly distributed on the root surface (plaque) and rhizodermis,
and after applying NP sizing on the root-surface and rhizodermis sections
indicated, a mean NP size is found that resembles the initial NP size
closely. This suggests that gold NPs are likely adsorbed to cell-wall
fibrils, thereby decreasing their mobility from the rhizodermis to
the cortex and central cylinder. In addition, the results show that
NPs are not degraded by plant exudates but retain their original size.
By converting the number of shots on the respective rhizodermis sections
to mass of matrix ablated, taking into account a detection-efficiency
factor (DEF) of 0.19, the NP number concentrations were found to be
6.0 × 1011 and 1.5 × 1011 g–1. In summary, the developed LA-SP-ICPMS method may initiate new research
related to nanoparticle interactions in biological systems and nanotoxicology
by providing spatially resolved in situ information on NPs.

Figure 7 Image (in blue)
showing the distribution of gold in a root cross-section
from a sunflower plant exposed to gold NPs with a mean size of 60
nm, overlaid with a high-resolution time-resolved signal of a single
LA-SP-ICPMS line scan (in yellow). The high gold signals corresponding
to the rhizodermis of the root were subjected to NP analysis according
to the data-processing procedure in the Data Processing section. The pixel size in the image is 5 × 5 μm2, and the line-scan signal was recorded every 100 μs.

Conclusions
We
demonstrated how LA-SP-ICPMS can be used as a method for in
situ characterization of NPs in biomaterials. Optimization experiments
with gold nanoparticles in gelatin showed that a conventional two-volume
ablation cell suffices to distinguish individual nanoparticle events
upon measurement with a detector capable of dwell times as low as
100 μs. However, it is critical that the laser fluence is kept
below 1 J cm–2 to avoid NP degradation and that
the NPs arriving at the ICPMS are constrained so as to prevent detection
of double NP events. Constrainment can be achieved by instrumental
dilution via decreasing the beam size or repetition rate. Nevertheless,
dissolved-gold species may interfere in the detection of NPs when
the noise in this background starts to compete with the NP signals.
Provided these LA-SP-ICPMS NP-sizing conditions are met, even NPs
of mixed size can be distinguished below 100 nm, the maximum size
for particles to be called NPs. The minimum detectable gold-NP size
is ca. 15 nm in the presence of negligible amounts of dissolved gold
species. LA-SP-ICPMS NP analysis of gold NPs in root cross-sections
of sunflower plants that were exposed to 60 nm gold NPs in hydroponics
showed the real-world applicability of the technique.
