Mass
spectrometry (MS) is one of the primary techniques used for large-scale
analysis of small molecules in metabolomics studies. To date, there
has been little data format standardization in this field, as different
software packages export results in different formats represented
in XML or plain text, making data sharing, database deposition, and
reanalysis highly challenging. Working within the consortia of the
Metabolomics Standards Initiative, Proteomics Standards Initiative,
and the Metabolomics Society, we have created mzTab-M to act as a
common output format from analytical approaches using MS on small
molecules. The format has been developed over several years, with
input from a wide range of stakeholders. mzTab-M is a simple tab-separated
text format, but importantly, the structure is highly standardized
through the design of a detailed specification document, tightly coupled
to validation software, and a mandatory controlled vocabulary of terms
to populate it. The format is able to represent final quantification
values from analyses, as well as the evidence trail in terms of features
measured directly from MS (e.g., LC-MS, GC-MS, DIMS, etc.) and different
types of approaches used to identify molecules. mzTab-M allows for
ambiguity in the identification of molecules to be communicated clearly
to readers of the files (both people and software). There are several
implementations of the format available, and we anticipate widespread
adoption in the field.

==== Body
Introduction
It
is now commonplace for high-throughput quantitative technologies to
be used for analysis of biological, biomedical, and environmental
samples. Technologies include those for measurements of gene expression
using microarrays or RNA sequencing (transcriptomics), proteins by
mass spectrometry (MS, proteomics), and MS or nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy for measuring small molecules/metabolites (metabolomics)
and lipids (lipidomics). These methods can provide the source data
for systems biology/medicine investigations into the complex network
of interactions that reflect both their functional and dysfunctional
states, as well as reflect nutritional and environmental impacts.
There is now an accepted principle in scientific research that data
should be made openly and easily accessible to allow groups other
than the initial data generators to verify the findings or search
for new interpretations. Such guidelines are now commonly referred
to as the “FAIR” principles, data being findable, accessible,
interoperable, and reusable.1 Furthermore,
data from omics experiments are typically expensive to generate and
often have potential uses beyond their initial purpose, including
in meta-analyses, in data integration, or for testing and assisting
in the development of new software. In omics research, there is always
some heterogeneity in the approaches taken in different laboratories,
such as different instrument platforms or analysis software, which
usually have their own file formats. To allow data sets to be open
for reuse generally requires the formulation of nonproprietary data
formats, or more ideally, agreed data standards to which different
producers of data must adhere. Without agreed standards (or ubiquitous
formats originating from one package), data reuse is highly challenging,
since informatics groups would need to write file format converters
for every possible source of data, as well as keep these converters
updated whenever data-producing software makes a format change. This
scenario makes development of analysis software or a specific usage
of public databases very challenging.

In a typical MS-based
metabolomics/lipidomics pipeline, samples are analyzed by liquid or
gas chromatography, coupled to MS (LC-MS/GC-MS), or by direct infusion
(DIMS). Measurement of molecular intensity is typically done via software
that detects features formed from isotopic patterns (or single peaks)
along the time axis. For LC-MS, ionization can be performed in either
positive or negative mode to produce protonated or deprotonated ions.
It is also common for ion adducts to be formed, including metal adducts
(Na+, K+), which have the same time elution
profile but different m/z values.
Many software packages perform adduct grouping, such that quantification
values are reported both for individual features, as well as for the
summed abundance across different adduct forms assumed to have come
from the same starting molecule. For quantification across different
samples, software may perform retention time alignment to ensure that
the same features are quantified in each sample. In GC-MS, analysis
is performed on volatile molecules and, in some cases, a derivatization
step is applied to increase the volatility of compounds of interest.

Molecular identification remains challenging in metabolomics. Typically,
some combination of the following steps can assist with identification
via searching a pre-existing library or database: accurate neutral
mass, the relative abundance of isotopomers, the retention time, masses
of fragmentation products (MS/MS and MSn spectra), collisional
cross section for platforms with ion mobility, etc. (see the reviews
in refs (2−4) for more details). In the case
of MS/MS and MSn fragmentation, the spectra can be compared
against an in-house spectral library or databases storing reference
spectra for molecules including Metlin,5 The Human Metabolome Database,6 Global
Natural Products Social Molecular Networking7 (GNPS), MassBank,8 and others (see ref (9) for a review) or analyzed
by in silico identification software.10

It is common in all approaches for many molecules to remain
unannotated or for ambiguity to remain: i.e., software provides a
list of possible molecules for each MS feature. Reporting standards
and guidelines on these certainties have been developed in several
communities.11,12 Following quantification (and
identification), statistical analysis usually proceeds via univariate
approaches, e.g. to find differentially expressed molecules between
conditions, or multivariate/machine learning approaches to explore
structure within the data and find molecules that can separate sample
groups and thus act as potential biomarkers.

There exists a
wide range of software, both free and commercial, for processing MS
data for metabolomics/lipidomics.13,14 Most software
produces output data in a unique file format, annotated to different
levels of detail, often with the description of preprocessing procedures
followed implicit rather than specified, making it highly challenging
to compare or integrate the results of different pipelines. For public
data sharing, there are several databases that host data sets in support
of publications or community data sets, including the European Bioinformatics
Institute (EMBL-EBI) MetaboLights database15 and the NIH Metabolomics Workbench.16

In this work, we describe a data standard for MS-based metabolomics
analytical pipelines, called mzTab-M, which captures the downstream
results of analysis (i.e., excluding raw data), suitable for statistical
analysis, result visualization, or submission to a public repository
in support of a publication. The standard has been developed in a
joint and open process between members of the Metabolomics Standards
Initiative (MSI),17 the Metabolomics Society
Data Standards Task Group, and the Proteomics Standards Initiative
(PSI), which had originally developed the mzTab format on which it
is based.18 There are several related and
complementary efforts, which include efforts to define minimum reporting
requirements for different aspects of metabolomics.11,19 There is also general agreement among standards groups (MSI, Metabolomics
Society) to promote the use of the PSI’s mzML format for raw
data storage.20 mzML is an XML-based standard
for MS data, either for profile data as recorded directly from the
instrument or for centroided data (peak picked in the m/z domain). The freely available ProteoWizard software
embeds software libraries from several vendors of MS instruments,
enabling the conversion of vendor raw files into mzML.21 For NMR metabolomics, the recently released
nmrML standard follows a design principle similar to that of mzML,
capturing NMR spectra and some metadata within an XML-based standard.22 For the description of study design, experimental
metadata, and sample processing parameters, the ISA framework,23 while generally applicable to all types of experimental
design, has been particularly taken up by the metabolomics field.
The PSI previously developed the mzTab format (version 1.0) to act
as a simple format for quantified and/or identified peptides and proteins
in MS workflows.18 mzTab version 1.0 also
has a section to allow small-molecule data to be captured. However,
the data model was rather simple and did not cover some important
use cases for metabolomics/lipidomics and, as a result, it has not
been extensively used for small molecules or lipids. The development
of mzTab-M has thus branched off from the original mzTab format development,
and we report it here as a new standard for metabolomics called mzTab-M
(“version 2.0” to differentiate it from mzTab version
1.0). It follows design principles similar to those of mzTab 1.0,
but it is not backward compatible.

Methods
The mzTab-M
format was designed in a process that was open to any interested parties.
All associated materials and code for processing and validating files
are fully open source and are hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzTab). mzTab-M started from the design of mzTab version 1.0 format but
was further developed to support the specific needs of metabolomics
(see the Supporting Information for more
details on the relationship). The development took place via face-to-face
workshops and regular conference calls. The specifications have been
submitted to a formal document process for anonymous review, overseen
by an editor commissioned jointly between the PSI and the Metabolomics
Society. The mzTab-M format is defined by the specification document
and example files that demonstrate how to encode certain features
(see the GitHub repository). The specification document describes
the overall structure of the format: what tables must be present,
what columns and rows must be present in those tables, and what terminology
is allowed as data values. For various aspects of metadata, the standard
enforces (and can be checked by validation software) that controlled
vocabulary (CV) terms are used (e.g. for names of software, databases,
parameters, statistics, etc.), which can be sourced from the PSI-MS
CV26 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/ms), as well as other CVs where appropriate.

Results and Discussion
mzTab-M has been designed to act as a single data format for metabolomics
and lipidomics, including an appropriate level of detail about the
“final” results: i.e., molecules quantified across samples.
The format also contains the ability to represent “intermediate”
or supporting data, including the evidence trail for identifications
from software (scores or statistics), as well as the quantification
values derived directly from MS: i.e., prior to any adduct grouping
or summarization steps. The format is represented as tab-separated
text, meaning that it can be loaded directly into a spreadsheet editor
or into statistical software such as R or SPSS for downstream analysis
and visualization, without any need for coding, and can thus replace
the use of tables (e.g., in pdf or Excel format) of supplementary
data in support of publications. It is also relatively straightforward
for informatics groups to develop software to add support for the
standard to existing software.

The mzTab-M format consists of
four cross-referenced data tables (Figure 1): metadata (MTD), small molecule (SML),
small molecule feature (SMF) and the small molecule evidence (SME).
The MTD and SML tables are mandatory, and for a file to contain any
evidence about how molecules were quantified or identified by software,
all four tables must be present. The tables must follow the order
MTD, SML, SMF, and SME, with a blank line separating each table. The
structure of each table, in terms of the rows and columns that must
be present, is tightly specified, as explained in the following sections
and formally in the mzTab-M specification document.

an mzTab-M file. (A) Metadata about the experiment, describing experimental
design (study variables and assays), links to other files, etc.. (B)

MS run for MS1 features: e.g., mapped to individual adducts
or charge states of a molecule. (D) Evidence supporting identification
(with ambiguity if needed) for molecules, using CV terms for scores/statistics
where available.

Metadata (MTD) Table
The metadata table has multiple rows and exactly three columns
(Figure 1A). Each row
must contain (1) “MTD”, (2) a parameter name, and (3)
the parameter value. The types of parameters that must or may be present
are described in the specification document, and allowed values from
CVs are defined in a mapping file. The MTD table must report at least
a simple specification of the experimental design, in terms of the
number of different measurements (i.e., usually the count of MS runs)
and the groupings of those MS runs (i.e., experimental factors or
groups) over which statistical analysis may be done. These values
then inform the number of columns present in SML and SMF tables for
which (relative or absolute) quantitative values are reported. The
following concepts are specified in the MTD table so that they can
be referenced and reused elsewhere in the file:Assay: the application of a measurement
about the sample (in this case through MS), producing values about
small molecules or lipids. One assay is typically mapped to one ms_run
element (see below), although the differentiation between assay and
ms_run is present to provide a mechanism for grouping multiple MS
runs together if the sample has been fractionated and different fractions
run on the instrument to increase coverage. The MTD table gives the
count of assays with locally unique identifiers, so that they can
be referenced by other elements.

ms_run:
an MS run is effectively one run on an MS instrument (e.g., by LC-MS,
GC-MS, DIMS, etc.) and can be referenced from assay elements in different
contexts. When an ISA-Tab document from mzTab-M is referenced, ms_run
should be matched with the ISA “Assay Name” values found
in an ISA “Assay Table” file (https://isa-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/isatab.html).

Sample: a biological material that
has been analyzed, to which descriptors of species, cell/tissue type,
etc. can be attached. Samples are not mandatory, since some software
packages that will produce mzTab-M files cannot determine what type
of sample was analyzed (e.g., whether biological or technical replication
was performed), although it is noted that, without such annotations,
downstream statistical analysis of the results will often not be possible.

study_variable: a “study_variable”
(SV) element represents a grouping of replicates for which a quantitative
value can be reported, for example following averaging of values from
individual assays. More accurately, a “study_variable”
element usually represents a level of some particular
experimental variable, such as the value of time within a time course,
dose of a drug, intervention performed on samples, etc. In other contexts,
this concept is named differently: e.g., “Factor Value”
in ISA format.



Clear definitions of biological
and technical replicates are difficult to provide, as the commonly
used terminologies are somewhat dependent upon the biological domain.
However, we use the following general definitions in mzTab-M: biological
replicates represent cases when different samples are analyzed by
MS, and technical replicates represent cases where the same samples
are analyzed multiple times by MS. As illustrated in Figure 2, a simple form of the experimental
design can be captured in mzTab-M using a combination of assay, “study_variable”,
and “sample”. In a complex, nested design, linkages
between different study variables are not explicitly modeled but captured
through the annotated values, as shown in the Supporting Information.

Figure 2 Simple experimental designs in mzTab-M
can be represented using a combination of the elements study_variable
(SV), assay, ms_run, and sample. Quantitative values can be reported
in files for SVs and assays. (A) SV is intended to capture different
groups of replicates, which might have resulted from different levels
of a given variable: e.g. control versus treated (represented as 2
SVs) and n time points over a treatment course (as n SVs). (B) assay captures a measurement made about a molecule
(small molecule/lipid) where multiple assays within the same SV are
taken to be replicates of some kind (biological or technical). (C)
ms_run captures a single run on an MS instrument. (D) Samples are
optional in mzTab, since the quantitative software may often be unaware
of the biological samples that have been analyzed. If that information
is available, references from assay to the same (technical, upper
half) or different (biological, bottom half) samples are used to describe
the type of replication performed.

The MTD table also has the (optional) capability to capture
additional metadata that can be useful to interpret the study, such
as limited details about the sample processing steps performed, the
MS instrument, software and parameters, contact details for the study
producers, etc. However, it is acknowledged that other formats may
capture such details, such as referenced mzML (including instrument
information and parameters), other MS data file formats, or ISA-Tab
files (containing experimental design and sample processing), which
may be more appropriate locations for such information.

Small Molecule
(SML) Table
The small molecule (SML) table (Figure 1B) is intended to capture the
“final” results of the study in terms of molecules that
have been quantified (with identification data, where available).
If different adduct forms or fragments of a molecule have been observed
as different MS features, it is common that feature grouping is performed,
and the SML table should contain the final quantitative values after
summarization. Thus, SML could be viewed as the equivalent of tabular
results presented in a paper for the molecules quantified in different
samples. For survey-type data, it is also possible to report quantities
as “null”, while still reporting identification evidence,
as supported by the SME table.

The header row has “SMH”
in the first column, followed by an ordered set of column headers.
After the header row, each row reports one molecule, with the first
cell containing “SML”, followed by the data values for
each specified column. The columns include a unique local identifier
for the molecule (SML_ID), followed by a cell (SMF_ID_REFS) containing references to features in the SMF
table. The referenced features are the different adduct forms or in-source
fragments of the molecular features actually detected by MS. The next
set of columns provides different ways to identify the molecule (database_identifer, chemical_formula, smiles, inchi, chemical_name,
uri, theoretical_neutral_mass; see section Identification
evidence and ambiguity below).

The following columns
report quantitative data for the n assays (in n columns, where n is the count of assays
reported in MTD) and the m study_variable groups
(in m columns) e.g. as an average (e.g., mean) across
assay values within that study_variable. A value
can also be provided for the variability in the study_variable quantification value reported e.g. a standard error value. A parameter
in MTD specifies how to interpret the quantitative values in these
columns in terms of a data type exported from a specific piece of
software or where appropriate, absolute values with units.

At
the right-hand end of the SML table (and SMF and SME tables), it is
possible to include user-specified (optional) columns, with a method
for annotating that the columns refer to the entire molecule, or the
measurement of the molecule in particular assays or study_variables. The user-specified columns thus make mzTab-M
extensible to support custom data types not covered in the core model.

Small Molecule Feature (SMF) Table
The SMF table contains
data on what features were actually measured by the instrument and
quantified by software (Figure 1C). The header row of the table has “SFH” in
the first cell, followed by a set of columns. Each row of the table
is one MS feature recorded across different runs, starting with the
code “SMF”. It is assumed that an alignment process
has taken place so that the same feature has been seen across different
runs, with missing values handled as appropriate (see specification
document for guidance on encoding nonaligned workflows). The next
column (SME_ID_REFS) is for referencing down to the
final table: Small Molecule Evidence (SME) via a set of identifier
references, as well as a code telling the file reader how to interpret
multiple references (SME_ID_REF_ambiguity_code),
explained in Identification Evidence and Ambiguity.

The SMF table next contains information about the type of
adduct and charge state observed, the experimental m/z value, the retention time of the feature (in
a master or averaged run), and a method for optionally specifying
if a given isotopomer has been quantified (+1 or +2 peak, 13C peak, etc.) as used in some isotopic labeling/flux studies. The
following columns represent the quantitative data within each of the n assays recorded in the MTD section. For SML, a parameter
in MTD also describes how to interpret the quantitative values recorded.

Small Molecule Evidence (SME) Table
The SME table represents
strands of potentially heterogeneous types of evidence supporting
the identification of a molecule (Figure 1D). Each row contains the result of one identification
process (library search, pattern match, manual curation, etc.). The
header of the table starts with “SEH” followed by a
set of columns. The second column is a local identifier for a row
of evidence (SME_ID), followed by a local identifier
for the input data to the process (evidence_input_id). evidence_input_id is needed for the cases where
different rows of evidence are reported for the same input data (MS2 spectrum, accurate mass + retention time, isotope pattern,
etc.). They can be linked by sharing the same value for evidence_input_id. As in the SML table, a set of columns exists to specify the molecular
identity from a variety of sources or identifier types (database_identifer,
chemical_formula, smiles, inchi, chemical_name, uri). The
experimental m/z value of the feature,
the charge, and the theoretical m/z value (e.g., from a database) can be recorded, along with scores
or confidence measures coming from the software used to support the
identification. If a fragmentation spectrum has been used, there is
a mechanism for referencing the exact spectrum in the source file
(e.g., mzML file) and the MS level of the input data to the identification
process.

Identification Evidence and Ambiguity
Small-molecule
identification is a well-known challenge in MS metabolomics, and even
more so in MS lipidomics, where complete structural elucidation of
molecules is often not possible. Different levels of “identification”
might be possible, ranging from having the accurate mass only, the
chemical formula, a list of possible identifiers to molecules in a
database (with the same or different formula), or a complete molecular
structure resolved: e.g., if a complementary technique such as NMR
has been used. mzTab-M has been designed to accommodate all the different
possibilities in a simple yet flexible structure (Figure 3). For further details on how
identifications of lipids and other compound classes can be represented
see the Supporting Information.

Figure 3 (A) The summary
level (SML) reports the final assumed identifications, allowing for
ambiguity by including “|” separated results in the
relevant columns. (B) The feature level (SMF) does not explicitly
report identifications but references down to the SME level. Ambiguity
is propagated via referencing multiple SME rows with different identification
results. (C) One SME row represents a single possible identification
from some input evidence. Multiple identifications from the same input
data share the same value for evidence_input_id.
Ambiguity can be captured by different rows for the same input data.

In a row of the final results
(SML table), the export software can include one or more identifiers
from external databases: e.g., “CHEBI:16811” where the
prefix is defined in MTD as referencing the ChEBI database24 (with a URL) and the identifier is the ChEBI
unique identifier (in this case for methionine). Similarly, the specification
allows for the chemical formula in standard notation, simplified molecular-input
line-entry system (SMILES25), or InChi26 to be provided. In all cases, if ambiguity has
not been resolved, then a Pipe “|” separated list of
identifiers can be provided in the same cell. There are several measures
for describing the confidence of identification, including the use
of reliability codes such as those developed by the MSI11,12 and the score or confidence measures from identification software
where available.

To trace the evidence source, references via
the features (SMF table) and on to the SME table should be provided.
In the case that adduct grouping (i.e., multiple SMF rows) has been
performed prior to identification, then the different SMF rows will
reference the same SME rows. At the SME level, if there are different
rows from the same input data (e.g., different database matches),
then it is expected that the SMF element(s) references multiple SME
elements that share the same value for evidence_input_id. It is also possible to report different evidence streams to support
identification, such as searches in different libraries. As such,
SMF rows can reference multiple SME elements carrying different values
of evidence_input_id. Given that these two cases
would both result in multiple SME identifiers referenced from an SMF
row, an extra code can be provided at the SMF level (SME_ID_REF_ambiguity_code) containing values to differentiate whether ambiguity has been resolved
or still remains (see the specification document for a full description).

Using CVs and File Validation
mzTab-M extensively uses CVs
to provide unambiguous terms for annotation. For parameters relating
to MS and associated processing, CV terms should generally be sourced
from the PSI MS CV.27 Several other CVs
are recommended for describing details about sample types, species
taxonomy, sample preparation, etc. (see the specification document).
To ensure that valid CV terms are used, we have extended the concept
of the PSI semantic validation framework.28 The framework includes a mapping file that states the groups of
CV terms allowed at each position in mzTab-M, enabling the list of
terms to expand over time, without changes in the standard or software.
New terms can be added straightforwardly by making a request on a
mailing list: e.g., for a term describing new software, scores, or
statistics. A crucial part of the standard is therefore a validator
to ensure that files exported from different packages fulfill the
rules defined in the specification, so that they can be read without
error by other software. We have developed validation software for
mzTab-M, available from jmzTab (project: https://github.com/lifs-tools/jmzTab-m), which checks not only that the structure of the file is correct
but also that valid and correct CV terms have been used throughout.

Implementation in Software and Databases
The specifications
have been verified by both PSI and MSI formal review processes, from
which the stable version (mzTab-M 2.0) has been released. It is not
expected that there will be changes to the format for several years
to allow implementations to be developed. A reference implementation
with parser, writer, and validator (in jmzTab-m) has been developed
in Java (as for mzTab 1.029). jmzTab-m
provides an OpenAPI 2.0 compatible API model that serves as the basis
for automatic model generation in a wide number of programming languages
(C++, JavaScript, R, Python), reducing the burden of implementation.
The library provides parsing, validation, and writing of mzTab-M files
and object models. A web-based application (https://apps.lifs.isas.de/mztabvalidator/) provides a user-friendly user interface to perform standard and
semantic validation and to display validation results. Additional
implementations are under development in software including XCMS,30 Progenesis QI (Waters), Lipid Data Analyzer,31 OpenMS,32 and MetaboLights.15 Over the coming years, we will be promoting
the implementation of the standard in a wide variety of both open-source
and commercial software to act as a universal standard for metabolomics
and lipidomics.

Conclusions
We have developed mzTab-M
for metabolomics data representation and sharing. The standard has
been developed in an open process with widespread consultation of
different approaches taken in the field and involvement of software
teams from academic research groups as well as industry. The standard
has undergone a rigorous peer review process by both the MSI and PSI
to ensure that the resulting standard is of high quality and is stable.
The standard is expected to remain stable for several years, except
for improvements to documentation and extensions to the CV, allowing
research groups and commercial developers to invest time in the implementation.
We also encourage other groups interested in standardizing omics data,
particularly those using MS (e.g. glycomics), to adopt the mzTab model/design,
CV infrastructure, and associated software.
