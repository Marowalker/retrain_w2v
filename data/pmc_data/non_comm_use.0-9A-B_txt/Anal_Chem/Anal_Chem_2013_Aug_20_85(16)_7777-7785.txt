Reversed-phase
liquid chromatography has become the preferred method
for separating peptides in most of the mass spectrometry-based proteomics
workflows of today. In the way the technique is typically applied,
the peptides are released from the chromatography column by the gradual
addition of an organic buffer according to a linear function. However,
when applied to complex peptide mixtures, this approach leads to unequal
spreads of the peptides over the chromatography time. To address this,
we investigated the use of nonlinear gradients, customized for each
setup at hand. We developed an algorithm to generate optimized gradient
functions for shotgun proteomics experiments and evaluated it for
two data sets consisting each of four replicate runs of a human complex
sample. Our results show that the optimized gradients produce a more
even spread of the peptides over the chromatography run, while leading
to increased numbers of confident peptide identifications. In addition,
the list of peptides identified using nonlinear gradients differed
considerably from those found with the linear ones, suggesting that
such gradients can be a valuable tool for increasing the proteome
coverage of mass spectrometry-based experiments.

==== Body
Shotgun proteomics, also referred
to as bottom-up proteomics, has become an essential tool in biological
research.1 Tremendous developments in sample
preparation,2 instrumentation,3 and data analysis software4 have enabled the identification and quantification of thousands
of proteins in a single run.5 In its most
widespread workflows, the technique involves the digestion of the
proteins of interest into peptides, the separation of the resultant
peptide mixture into one or several fractions, followed by mass spectrometry
(MS) analysis of the peptides in each fraction. The generated fragmentation
spectra are subsequently matched to peptide sequences and assigned
statistical confidence, and a list of proteins likely to be present
in the initial sample is inferred.

Within these advancements,
a major role has been played by fractionation
techniques, in particular reversed-phase liquid chromatographic (RPLC),
which despite other options remains the almost exclusive method for
separating peptides prior to electrospray ionization.6 In the way the technique is typically applied, the peptides
are separated on a liquid chromatography (LC) column under gradient
conditions, by the progressive addition of an increasing percentage
of organic solvent according to a linear function.7 In the past decade, several studies have shown that alterations
in column length, inner diameter, packing material or temperature
may dramatically increase the yield of a shotgun proteomics experiment.8−10 Furthermore, it has been shown that modern LC-systems combined with
ultralong gradients are a powerful technology, with great potential
in the context of clinical samples where often limited amounts of
biological material are available.11,12 However, whereas
a number of studies have examined the effects of extending the gradient
time,13,14 little is known about the consequences of
changing the shape of the gradient function when analyzing complex
peptide mixtures.

Currently, a limiting factor for the number
of proteins that can
be identified in a shotgun experiment is the rate at which the mass
spectrometer fragments peptides.15 As an
example, without considering miscleavages, post-translational modifications,
or sequence variations, a theoretical digest of the human Swissprot
2012_09 database contains more than 3.7 × 105 unique
tryptic peptides. Assuming a four hours experiment, this translates
to a total of 1500 peptides that the mass spectrometer would need
to sequence every minute, which is beyond the capabilities of even
the fastest instruments presently available. This problem is further
augmented by the unequal spread of the peptides over the gradient
time, with a majority of the peptides eluting in only a short portion
of the chromatography run.16 While in theory
one could calculate different gradient functions producing even distributions
of the peptides, little is known about the use of such functions in
the context of shotgun proteomics experiments of complex mixtures.

Following these observations, we herein investigate the use of
nonlinear gradients for the RPLC separation of complex peptide mixtures.
We implemented an algorithm that calculates two such gradients, one
designed to produce an even distribution for the theoretical peptides
from an in silico digest, and one that evens the distribution of the
high-intensity MS1 ions. We evaluated the nonlinear gradients for
two data sets consisting of four replicate runs of a complex sample,
and found that they produced both more equally spread peptides throughout
the run, and increased numbers of confident peptide identifications.
In addition, the list of peptides identified using nonlinear gradients
differed considerably from the one found with the linear ones, suggesting
that such gradients can facilitate the identification of novel peptide
species. The algorithm to calculate nonlinear gradients is straightforward
to apply, and a python implementation can be downloaded under MIT

Experimental Section
Sample Preparation
A tryptic digest
of HeLa protein
extracts was prepared as previously described.12,14 Briefly, nocodazole arrested HeLa Kyoto cells were harvested and
protein was purified by acetone precipitation. After resuspension
in 8 M urea in 0.5 M ammonium bicarbonate (ABC), disulfide bridges
were reduced using 0.05 μg of dithiothreiotol (DTT) per μg
of protein, and alkylated with 0.25 μg of iodoacetamide per
μg of protein. The sample was subsequently diluted with 50 mM
ABC, first to 6 M urea, followed by 2 h digestion with LysC (1:50
w/w), and then to 0.8 M urea followed by o/n digestion with trypsin
(1:30 w/w).

Reversed-Phase Liquid Chromatography
Four
Hour Gradient Experiments
HeLa digest peptide
mixture (0.5 μg per injection) was separated on an UltiMate
3000 RSLCnano system (Dionex) using a 50 cm × 75 μm i.d.
column (AcclaimPepMap C18, 2 μm, 100 Å, Dionex).12 The sample was first loaded onto a trapping
column (2 cm × 100 μm i.d.; Acclaim PepMap C18, 5 μm,
100 Å) for 10 min using 0.1% TFA as a loading solution and a
loading pump flow rate of 25 μL/minutes. Subsequently, the trapping
column was switched in-line with the analytical column and the linear
gradient was started using a pump flow rate of 230 nL/min. Solvent
solutions were solvent A (0.1% FA) and solvent B (0.08% FA and 80%
acetonitrile).

For the linear gradient experiments, the analytical
column was first equilibrated in 98% A and 2% B, followed by a linear
gradient starting with 2% B at 10 min (the time-point of valve switching)
and increasing to 40% B at 250 min. To clear the system from hydrophobic
peptides, the linear gradient was followed by an increase to 50% B
at 255 min and to 90% B at 260 min, which was held constant for further
10 min. Subsequently, the concentration of solvent B was decreased
to 2% within 2 min, which was maintained for 33 min to prepare the
system for the next injection. The mass spectrometer was started by
a contact closure signal from the RSLC at 10 min.

For the nonlinear
gradients, all settings were kept identical,
including the settings of 2% B at 10 min and 40% B at 250 min. However,
for each minute between the time points 11 and 249 min, the calculated
concentration of solvent solution B for the respective optimized nonlinear
gradient was rounded at one decimal place and inserted into the LC
method (248 additional data points). Of note, the time intervals were
interpreted by the LC system as a series of linear gradients of 1
min duration. The LC system therefore did not deliver a step-gradient
but rather approximated the concentration of solvent B during each
of the 1 min intervals. This strategy permitted a simple yet flexible
design as well as an adequate representation of the nonlinear nature
of the optimized gradients within the framework of the standard LC
control software (Chromeleon, version 6.80 SR11).

Two blank
runs were programmed on the LC before each of the individual
linear or nonlinear sample analyses. Solvent solutions for blanks
were identical to samples, and the gradient was: 2% B for 10 min,
followed by a linear gradient from 2% B to 40% B from 10 to 40 min,
increased to 90% B at 45 min, which was maintained for 5 min, then
2% B at 52 min continued for 23 min for column equilibration.

The time difference between the LC method and the MS raw file was
estimated experimentally using an LC method identical to the linear
gradients described above, except for the fact that 98% A and 2% B
were maintained for 30.00 min, followed by a sharp increase to 30%
B at 30.01 min. This permitted an observation of the well-defined
time-point in the MS raw file at which peptides eluting from the analytical
column due to the abrupt increase in organic solvent concentration
were detected in the MS. Only 50 ng of the peptides were injected
for this purpose. For further details, refer to the Design of Optimized Gradients section.

Two Hour
Gradient Experiments
An Ultimate 3000 LC system
(Dionex) was employed for the 2 h gradient experiments. 0.5 μg
HeLa digest peptide mixture was injected and separated on a 15 cm
× 75 μm i.d. column (Acclaim PepMap C18, 2 μm, 100
Å, Dionex). After the sample was loaded onto a trapping column
(5 mm × 300 μm i.d.; Acclaim PepMap C18, 5 μm, 100
Å) for 10 min using 0.1% TFA as a loading solution and a loading
pump flow rate of 25 μL/min, the trapping column was switched
in-line with the analytical column and the linear gradient was started
using a pump flow rate of 230 nL/min. Solvent solutions were solvent
A (0.1% FA) and solvent B (0.08% FA and 80% acetonitrile).

The
analytical column was first equilibrated in 98% A and 2% B. The linear
gradient started with 2% B at 10 min (the time-point of valve switching),
increasing to 40% B at 130 min, followed by 90% B from 135 min until
140 min, then 2% B from 142 to 165 min to prepare the system for the
next injection. The mass spectrometer was started by a contact closure
signal from the LC at 20 min.

The nonlinear gradients were developed
in an analogous way as described
above for the 4 h gradients except for the different linear gradient
time. The time delay between the LC and the MS was estimated with
an LC method that included a step gradient which led to a sharp increase
in the concentration of organic solvent (%B) at 30.01 min LC time.

Mass Spectrometry Analysis
Four Hour Gradient Experiments
For
the long gradient
experiments, the LC was connected to a Q Exactive mass spectrometer
(Thermo Scientific) via a nanoelectrospray ion source (Proxeon). The
mass spectrometry method duration was 290 min, and the mass spectrometer
was operated in positive ionization mode. The source voltage was 1.9
kV, and the capillary temperature was 275 °C. One MS1 scan (m/z 350–2000, AGC target 3 ×
106 ions, maximum ion injection time 60 ms) acquired at
a resolution of 70 000 (at 200 m/z) was followed by up to 10 tandem MS scans (resolution 17 500
at 200 m/z) of the most intense
ions fulfilling the defined selection criteria (peptide match on,
exclude isotopes on, exclusion of singly charged precursors, AGC target
1 × 105 ions, underfill ratio 20%, maximum ion injection
time 120 ms, isolation window 2 Da, dynamic exclusion time 90 s).
The HCD collision energy was set to 30% NCE and the polydimethylcyclosiloxane
background ions at 445.120025 were used for internal calibration (lock
mass).

Two Hour Gradient Experiments
An LTQ-Orbitrap XL/ETD
mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) was connected to the LC via
a nanoelectrospray ion source (Proxeon) and operated in positive ionization
mode with a source voltage of 1.5 kV and a capillary temperature of
200 °C. Method duration was 140 min. One MS1 scan (m/z 400–1800, AGC target 1 × 106 ions, maximum ion injection time 500 ms) acquired at a resolution
of 60 000 at 400 m/z was
followed by up to 10 collision-induced dissociation scans (normalized
collision energy 35, activation time 30 ms, activation Q 0.25) of
the most intense ions (monoisotopic precursor selection enabled, exclusion
of singly charged precursor ions, AGC target 5 × 104 ions, maximum ion injection time 100 ms, dynamic exclusion time
30 s with an exclusion window of ±5 ppm). The minimal signal
threshold was 5 × 104, isolation width was 3 Da. FT
preview mode was enabled and polydimethylcyclosiloxane background
ions at 445.120025 were used for internal calibration (lock mass).

Data Processing
The tool msconvert from the ProteoWizard
software suite17 was used to convert all
the raw data to the .mzML and .ms2 file formats. We used Hardklör version 2.0318 for deconvolution and mass and charge calculations, and
Bullseye version 1.3019 to assign to each
peptide the apex retention time of its corresponding feature. The
fragmentation spectra were searched with Crux version 1.37,20 using the sequest–search command and
the following parameter values: precursor mass window of 10 ppm, the
enzyme set to trypsin, and the missed-cleavages option switched on.
The only fixed modification searched was the carbamidomethylation
of cysteine (57.021464 Da to all cysteines). The data sets were searched
against both the human Swissprot 2012_09 database, and a decoy database
obtained by reversing the sequences from the human database. The resulting
peptide-spectrum matches were postprocessed using Percolator version
2.04,21 which improved the rate of confidently
identified spectra, and provided statistical significance measures
such as false discovery rates (FDR) and posterior error probabilities
(PEP) at peptide level.

The full lists of peptide identifications
obtained following these procedures and parameters used to run each
software tool are available online at http://www.nada.kth.se/lumi/datasets/nonlinear_gradient/nonlinear_gradient.html.

Design of Optimized Gradients
We designed two nonlinear
gradients, denoted in silico-optimized and MS1-optimized, tailored
to give even distributions across the chromatographic run for the
theoretical peptides from an in silico digest of the human proteome,
and for the high-intensity MS1 ions detected using a linear gradient,
respectively. Each new gradient was defined by a function giving the
percentage of solvent B at every minute during the chromatographic
run.

To design these gradients, we first needed to estimate
the correspondence between the times tLC in which the gradient was given to the LC-system, and the times tMS when the effects of these instructions were
reported in the output file from the mass spectrometer. This correspondence
can be expressed by 1  where tlag is
a constant characteristic for the respective LC-MS system. We determined
the value of tlag for our data experimentally,
using the following procedure: we modified the linear LC gradient
so that 98% solvent A and 2% solvent B were delivered until 30.00
min, followed by an abrupt rise to 30% solvent B at 30.01 min (LC
method time). This led to a surge of peptides eluting from the analytical
column at a well-defined time-point (tpeptide_surge) which was observable in the MS raw file, permitting the calculation
of the time difference between the LC and the MS as tlag = tpeptide_surge–30.
For the 4 h runs we obtained tlag = 6.2
min, and for the 2 h runs tlag = −6.87
min.

In silico-Optimized Gradient
The in silico-optimized
gradient is designed to give an even spread for all the predicted
peptides of the analyzed proteome. The procedure consists of two steps:
the prediction of the peptides’ retention times, and the calculation
of an altered gradient giving a theoretical constant elution rate
for these peptides. Both steps are described in more details below.

To predict peptide retention times, we randomly selected 1500 peptides
confidently identified (FDR < 1%) in one of the runs based on the
linear gradient, and used these together with their observed retention
times to train a retention time model using the software package Elude.16,22 The observed retention time of each confident peptide was assigned
by first considering the best scoring spectrum for that particular
peptide, and then use Bullseye version 1.3019 to find for each such spectrum the apex retention time of its corresponding
feature.

Next, we performed an in silico digest of the proteins
in the Swissprot
2012_09 database, and retained only the peptides with masses between
600 and 8000 Da and between 8 and 50 amino acids long. We estimated
the retention times of these peptides using the previously trained
retention model and excluded the peptides predicted to elute outside
the gradient time. The remaining set included 378 058 unique
peptide sequences. Here we emphasize that, since the retention model
was trained on data generated using a linear gradient, the retention
time distribution obtained for the theoretical peptides was the one
expected when such a gradient is used.

In the next step we calculated
an optimal theoretical peptide elution
rate, Q = N/TΔ, where N is the number of theoretical
peptides and TΔ is the gradient
time. For the 4 h runs conditions, we used N = 378 058
and TΔ = 240 min, which resulted
in an optimal elution rate of Q = 1575.2 theoretical
peptides per minute. For the 2 h runs, TΔ = 120 min, and thus Q = 3150.5. We translated the
predicted retention time of each peptide to the corresponding volume
fraction of solvent B (ϕ%B), taking
the time translation of eq 1 into account. We
sorted the peptides according to their assigned volume fraction, ϕi%B, so that ϕi%B ≤ ϕi+1%B for each pair of peptides, i and i + 1. We then defined the in silico-optimized gradient
by assigning to each time point tMS the
volume fraction ϕ%B corresponding
to a linear interpolation between the peptides with indices closest
to tMSQ. More formally,
the gradient was defined by the function given below: 2  

Here we use the notation ⌊tMSQ⌋ for the closest integer smaller
than tMSQ, and ⌈tMSQ⌉ for the closest
larger integer.
Out of practical reasons we selected to calculate ϕ%B(tMS) in steps of one
minute from the beginning to the end of the gradient time. We subsequently
converted the time values to LC-times using eq 1.

MS1-Optimized Gradient
The first step in calculating
the MS1-optimized gradient was to compile an accurate list of MS1
ions using Krönik version 2.02.23 We chose to retain only those features that persisted over at least
four consecutive scans, with a gap tolerance of one scan. Furthermore,
if we assume a fragmentation speed of 300 peptides/min for the Q Exactive
mass spectrometer, this would result in a maximum of 72 000
MS1-features that could get fragmented during a 4 h experiment. Following
this reasoning, we considered in our calculations only the 72 000
MS1-features with the highest intensity. Thus, the MS1-optimized gradient
aimed at producing an even distribution of the highest abundant features
that could get fragmented during a shotgun proteomics experiment.
For the 2 h runs, we considered the 17 000 most abundant MS1-features.

The procedure to derive the gradient function was identical to
the one described for the in silico case, with the theoretical peptides
being replaced by the abundant MS1-features, and the predicted retention
times with the observed retention time apexes of these features.

Estimation of Chromatography Peak Widths
We fitted
a Gaussian to the chromatography profile of each MS1-feature by applying
a logarithm transformation of the data, followed by a parabolic line
of best fit. To minimize the tailing effects, we computed the best
fit using only the points within 25% from the maximum intensity, and
computed the coefficient of determination R2 for this subset. Further, we retained only the 50% MS1-features
with the highest intensity that fulfilled R2 > 0.95. We divided the gradient time in windows of 10 min, and
computed
the median peak width of the features eluting in each such window.
The peak widths were expressed in terms of the full width at half-maximum
(FWHM), which gives the width of a Gaussian peak at 50% of the maximum
peak height.

Experimental Design
For both the
4 and 2 h gradients,
we carried out twelve shotgun runs (a total of 24 runs): four identical
runs based on a linear gradient, four identical runs based on an in
silico-optimized gradient, and four runs based on slightly different
MS1-optimized gradients. Each of the MS1-optimized gradients was calculated
using each of the runs based on a linear gradient, while the in silico-optimized
gradient was calculated using only one of the linear runs. The reason
why we chose to calculate only one in silico-optimized gradient is
related to the low resolution of the current retention time prediction
algorithms. While such predictors are useful for estimating the general
distribution of the peptides across the run, they are often not able
to capture subtle changes in retention times, such as the ones observed
across replicate runs. Since the overall spread of the peptides is
highly similar across all the replicates based on a linear gradient,
training the predictor on one of these runs is sufficient to learn
this distribution.

In each case the four runs based on linear
gradients were carried out first, followed by the runs based on the
nonlinear gradients. All the experimental conditions were kept identical,
except for the gradient functions.

Results and Discussion
Nonlinear
Gradient Functions
Figure 1 Uneven distribution of confident peptide identifications.
We display
the average number of confident peptide identifications (FDR 1%) across
the replicates based on a 4 h linear gradient as a function of retention
time. The small segments on each bin indicate the standard deviation,
while the two vertical black lines illustrate the start and end of
the linear gradient. Supporting Information Figure S-1 gives a similar representation for the replicates based
on 2 h gradients.

For complex peptide mixtures,
the conventional linear gradients
used in liquid chromatography produce an unequal spread of the peptides
over time.16 To illustrate this, we first
examined the retention times of the analytes when using a 4 h linear
gradient and a Q Exactive mass spectrometer. We illustrated the distributions
across the run of the peptides identified at a 1% FDR (Figure 1), of the theoretical peptides from an in silico
digest of the human proteome (Figure 2A), and
of the abundant MS1-features (Figure 2B). Clearly,
all three distributions deviate considerably from uniformity, with
larger numbers of peptides eluting in the middle of the run, and relatively
few peptides eluting in the beginning and toward the end of the gradient
time.

In typical shotgun proteomics experiments, the mass spectrometers
are able to fragment only a fraction of the peptides eluting at any
given time point, most often selecting for the highest-intensity ions.24 This implies that, assuming the distributions
displayed in Figure 2, the peptides eluting
in the middle of the run get a lower probability to be selected for
fragmentation, and thus identified. A preferred scenario would include
an even spread of the peptides throughout the run, ensuring that the
instrument has access to equal numbers of analytes at any time point.
However, this cannot be achieved using the linear gradients typically
employed in such experiments, but would require the design of more
sophisticated nonlinear gradient functions.

Figure 2 Nonlinear gradient functions.
In panel A, we display the distribution
of the predicted retention times for the theoretical peptides from
an in silico digest of the human proteome when a linear gradient is
used. Panel B gives the average number of high-intensity MS1-features
for the four replicates based on a linear gradient. In panel C, we
illustrate the in silico-optimized gradient designed to uniformize
the distribution in panel A, and one of the four MS1-optimized gradients
calculated to even one of the distributions summarized in panel B.
Panel D displays the average number of theoretical peptides as a function
of predicted retention time when the in silico-optimized gradient
was used. Similarly, panel E gives the average number of highly abundant
MS1-features yielded by the four replicates based on MS1-optimized
gradients. The small segments on top of each bin give the standard
deviation over the four replicates. In panel F, we considered all
the peptides identified at 1% FDR in both a run based on the linear
gradient, and the corresponding runs based on the nonlinear gradients.
We show for each such peptide the retention time obtained with the
linear gradient against the retention times in the runs based on the
optimized gradients. All figures correspond to 4 h gradients, while
representations for the 2 h runs are given in Supporting Informatin Figure S-2.

To address this, we implemented an algorithm that calculates
two
such nonlinear gradients, denoted in silico-optimized and MS1-optimized.
The in silico-optimized gradient is tailored to give an even distribution
of the theoretical peptides from an in silico digest, while the MS1-optimized
gradient aims at uniformizing the abundant MS1 ions. As an example,
Figure 2C illustrates the nonlinear gradients
designed to uniformize the distributions in Figure 2A and B, with each gradient described as a function giving
the percentage of solvent B at every minute of the gradient run. As
expected, the two nonlinear gradients are steeper than the linear
one in the areas where few peptides are eluting, and more gradual
in the regions where the bulk of the peptides elute. Note that the
distributions displayed in Figure 2A and B
vary with the chromatography system. Hence, the optimized gradient
functions for other systems may be significantly different from the
ones displayed in Figure 2C.

Our procedure
to calculate nonlinear gradients depends only on
the following parameters: (i) start and end of the gradient, (ii)
correspondence between LC and MS times (see Experimental
Section), and (iii) the retention time distribution to optimize.
This makes the algorithm straightforward to apply for optimizing other
retention time distributions or chromatography systems of interest.
In addition, only changes in the chromatography setup that alter substantially
these parameters would require the recalculation of the gradient.
Furthermore, we draw the attention to an interesting difference in
the workflows to calculate the two nonlinear gradients. To design
an MS1-optimized gradient, we need to prerun our samples with a linear
gradient, since in the design process we require a list of MS1 intensities
from a linear gradient. This is not the case for the in silico-optimized
gradient, where it suffices to have access to a representative retention
time model of linear gradients.

Also, it is worth pointing out
that the view described here is
a highly simplified one. A multitude of additional factors such as
differences in ionization efficiencies of the peptides, ion suppression,
or variations in chromatographic efficiencies can greatly affect the
peptide identification rate achieved in a shotgun experiment. While
we do not address such factors in the current work, the complexity
they entail makes it impossible to predict the exact effect that a
new gradient will have on the number of confidently identified peptides.

Retention Time Distributions
Figure 3 Fragmentation rate across run. For one
replicate based on a 4 h
gradient, we display the number of MS/MS fragmentation events per
minute for each of the three types of gradients.

The two types of nonlinear gradients were first evaluated
on a
data set consisting of four replicate runs using 4 h gradients as
described in the Experimental Section. To
start with, we assessed the performance of the new gradients by examining
whether each of them produced the expected behavior in terms of retention
time distributions. Figure 2D and E summarize
the retention time distributions obtained when the two optimized gradients
were used. Clearly, these data demonstrate that both nonlinear gradients
produced significantly more even retention time distributions compared
to when using a linear gradient. This translated to a nearly constant
number of fragmentation events triggered by the mass spectrometer
throughout the run (Figure 3).

Further,
for the peptides confidently identified with both the linear and one
of the corresponding nonlinear gradients, we plotted the retention
time observed in the linear run as a function of the retention time
in the optimized runs (Figure 2F). The resulting
representations closely reproduced the nonlinear gradient functions
given in Figure 2C, indicating that our calculations
matched the experimental results, and that our procedure preserved
the relative order of elution of the peptides. More generally, these
results suggest that the nonlinear gradients are as predictable as
the linear ones.

The nonlinear gradients were also assessed
for shorter runs of
2 h. In coherence with the 4 h runs, the optimized gradients produced
more evenly distributed peptides for this data as well, as compared
to a linear gradient (Supporting Information Figure S-2). However, for these runs the distribution of the abundant
MS1-features produced by the MS1-optimized gradient was slightly more
skewed compared to the 4 h runs (Supporting Information Figure S-2E). This effect may be due to the fact that the initial
distribution to be optimized (Supporting Information Figure S-2B) was significantly more skewed as well.

Peptide Identifications
Next, we evaluated the optimized
gradients in terms of unique peptides confidently identified in each
of the runs (Table 1). All of the optimized
gradients led to statistically significant increases in numbers of
peptide identifications for both gradient lengths (two sample t test, one-tailed p < 0.01). Notably,
the increases were larger for the shorter gradients, where the MS1-optimized
gradient led to an average of 10% more peptide identifications compared
to the linear gradient. Also, while for the 4 h runs the in silico-optimized
gradient seem to perform better, the MS1-optimized gradient gave better
results for the shorter runs. This suggests that although the optimized
gradients gave improved identification rates for all the data sets
we investigated, the extent of these improvements vary with the chromatography
system and instrument settings employed.

Interestingly, the
list of confident peptide identifications obtained using optimized
gradients differed considerably from the peptides generated by the
linear gradients. For example, for the 4 h runs the overlap between
the peptides identified using a linear gradient, and the ones found
using an optimized one, ranged between 66% and 70% across the four
replicates, compared to 74–82% when comparing any two replicates
based on linear gradients (Figure 4A). A similar
trend was observed for the 2 h runs (Figure 4B), where between 69% and 78% of the peptides identified with a linear
gradient were also found with an optimized gradient, compared to 81–87%
when comparing two runs based on a linear gradient. Hence, the optimized
gradients did not only lead to more identifications but also allowed
us to identify different peptide species than the typical linear gradients.

Panel A corresponds to one replicate using 4 h gradients, while panel
B corresponds to 2 h gradients.

This latter observation is particularly important in connection
to shotgun studies of complex mixtures, where a great deal of efforts
have been directed toward increasing the proteome coverage.25 In this context, some common strategies include
the use of enzymes with different specificity,26 the use of long gradients,11,12 and the analysis
of the same sample various times.27 In
our data we found that by pooling the peptide identifications obtained
in one 4 h run based on a linear gradient, and one based on an optimized
gradient, we gain an average 10% more peptide identifications compared
to pooling the identifications from any two runs based on a linear
gradient. This effect was even more pronounced for the 2 h runs, where
we obtained an average of 18% more peptide identifications. Following
this observation, we can speculate that this effect would be even
larger for gradients deviating more from linearity than the ones used
throughout this study. This suggests that carefully designed nonlinear
gradients could be used to improve the comprehensiveness of proteomics
studies.

When inspecting the peptides identified only with a
nonlinear gradient,
we found across the replicates based on 4 h gradients that between
89% and 91% of these peptides mapped to proteins identified with at
least one confident peptide (1% FDR) in the corresponding run based
on a linear gradient. This was similar to comparing any two runs based
on a linear gradient, where between 88% and 91% of the peptides identified
in only one of the runs mapped to proteins that were identified with
at least one confident peptide in the other run. The same observation
was valid for the 2 h runs, although these numbers were somewhat lower:
between 81% and 86% of the peptides identified only with a nonlinear
gradient belonged to a protein identified with the corresponding linear
gradient, compared to 81–85% when comparing two runs based
on a linear gradient. These results indicate that the nonlinear gradients
did not favor a different class of proteins, but rather facilitated
the identification of different peptides for the same proteins as
the ones identified using a linear gradient.

Further, we checked
the retention times of the peptides identified
only with a nonlinear gradient, and found an enrichment of peptides
predicted to elute in the most crowded areas of the linear run (Figure 5A and Supporting Information Figure S-3A). This, despite the fact that the nonlinear gradients
produced nearly uniform distributions of the confident peptide identifications
(Supporting Information Figure S-4A and
B). When examining the intensity of the MS1 precursor ions, we found
that the peptides identified only with the nonlinear gradients corresponded
to lower intensity precursors compared to the common peptide identifications
(Figure 5B and Supporting
Information Figure S-3B).

Figure 5 Peptides identified with only one type
of gradient. For one of
the replicates based on 4 h gradients, we considered the peptides
identified at 1% FDR using the in silico-optimized gradient, but that
were not identified with the linear gradient. In panel A, we calculated
the corresponding retention times that these peptides would have had
if a linear gradient was used, and plotted the obtained distribution
in green color. In gray, we give the distribution of the confident
peptides identified with the linear gradient. For the same peptides,
panel B gives in green color the apex intensity of their precursor
ions. In gray, we display the precursor intensity of the common peptide
identifications between the in silico-optimized and linear run. Panels
C and D give similar representations for the peptides confidently
identified with the linear gradient, but that were not present among
the peptide identifications obtained with the in silico-optimized
gradient. Note that for facilitating the comparison of the distributions,
all the histograms were normalized. In absolute numbers, the green
and blue distributions are much smaller than the gray ones.

In addition, we inspected the
retention times and precursor intensities
of the peptides that were identified at 1% FDR with the linear gradient,
but missed at the same FDR threshold with the corresponding nonlinear
gradients. Figure 5C and D give the results
of these analyses when comparing a run based on a linear gradient
with one based on the in silico-optimized gradient, and Supporting Information Figure S3-C and D give
similar representations for the MS1-optimized gradient. These results
indicate that (i) there was an enrichment of peptides identified only
with the linear gradient in the areas where this gradient was shallower
than the in silico-optimized one; (ii) the peptides identified only
with the linear gradient corresponded to lower abundance precursor
ions than the common peptide identifications. The same observations
were valid for the 2 h gradients (Supporting Information Figures S-5 and S-6).

To summarize, the nonlinear gradients
missed some of the confident
identifications eluting in parts of the run where the linear gradient
was shallower, but compensated for them by facilitating the identification
of more peptides in the crowded areas of the linear run. Both the
missed and the additional peptides corresponded to lower intensity
precursors compared to the common identifications.

Chromatographic
Peak Widths
Previous research has shown
that shallower gradients lead to peak broadening.13 Since the nonlinear gradients often displayed gentler slopes
compared to the linear ones (Figure 2C), we
examined the extent of this effect in our data. Figure 6 displays the median peak width as a function of the retention
time for one of the 4 h runs. Indeed, the two nonlinear gradients
generated wider peaks in the middle of the run, corresponding to the
regions where they increased slower than the linear gradient. However,
they produced sharper peaks in the beginning and at the end of the
gradient time.

Figure 6 Chromatographic peak widths. For each type of gradient,
we display
the estimated peak width as a function of the retention time. The
graphs corresponds to one of the 4 h runs, while Supporting Information Figure S-7 gives a similar representation
for the 2 h runs.

In general, broader peaks
translate to a decrease in the signal
reaching the mass spectrometer, which in turn is associated to a drop
in number of peptide identifications.14 However, with our optimized nonlinear gradients, the negative impact
of the wider peaks was surpassed by the advantage of having a more
even distribution of the peptides throughout the run. Nevertheless,
one can imagine that the use of nonlinear gradients for very long
runs may be hampered by such an effect. A straightforward solution
to this would be to limit the allowed slope at any time of the optimized
gradient. While this implies that the resulted nonlinear gradient
may not correspond to a perfectly even distribution of the peptides
throughout the run, it would still give an improved spread of the
peptides, while controlling for the allowed peak broadening.

Reproducibility
of the Nonlinear Gradients
Further,
as our data comprised of replicates for each of the three gradients,
we investigated the reproducibility of the gradients in terms of confident
peptide identifications (Table 2). Our results
showed that the two nonlinear gradients yielded similar numbers of
peptide identifications common to more replicates as the linear gradients.
As an example, for the 4 h runs 78% and 80% of the peptides found
using the MS1-optimized and in silico-optimized gradients, respectively,
were identified in at least two out of the four replicates run with
each of these gradients. The same figure was 77% for the replicates
based on a linear gradient. Thus, in terms of reproducibility, the
optimized gradients yielded comparable results to the linear ones.

a For each of the three gradient
types, we investigated how many peptides were identified at 1% FDR
in one (1/4), two (2/4), three (3/4), or all (4/4) of the four replicates
run with that gradient. The results are given in both number of peptide
identifications and percentages.

Conclusions
Despite extensive efforts to improve peptide
separation in RPLC,6 little is known about
the effects of changing
the shape of the linear gradient functions typically employed in such
experiments. Here, we have implemented an algorithm that calculates
two nonlinear gradient functions, designed to produce even spreads
over the chromatography time for the peptides of a complex mixture.
Our results showed that the nonlinear gradients produced more even
retention time distributions, while yielding increased numbers of
confident peptide identifications. Furthermore, they led to a considerable
number of distinct peptide identifications eluting in the crowded
areas of the linear runs, suggesting the potential of using such gradients
for improving the proteome coverage attained by shotgun experiments.
The new gradients produced reproducible results, were straightforward
to implement, and can be easily extended to optimize other distributions
of interest.
