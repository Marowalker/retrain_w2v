Coenzymes of cellular redox reactions
and cellular energy mediate
biochemical reactions fundamental to the functioning of all living
cells. Despite their immense interest, no simple method exists to
gain insights into their cellular concentrations in a single step.
We show that a simple 1H NMR experiment can simultaneously
measure oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD+ and NADH), oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+ and NADPH), and adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) and its precursors, adenosine diphosphate (ADP)
and adenosine monophosphate (AMP), using mouse heart, kidney, brain,
liver, and skeletal muscle tissue extracts as examples. Combining
1D/2D NMR experiments, chemical shift libraries, and authentic compound
data, reliable peak identities for these coenzymes have been established.
To assess this methodology, cardiac NADH and NAD+ ratios/pool
sizes were measured using mouse models with a cardiac-specific knockout
of the mitochondrial Complex I Ndufs4 gene (cKO)
and cardiac-specific overexpression of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase
(cNAMPT) as examples. Sensitivity of NAD+ and NADH to cKO
or cNAMPT was observed, as anticipated. Time-dependent investigations
showed that the levels of NADH and NADPH diminish by up to ∼50%
within 24 h; concomitantly, NAD+ and NADP+ increase
proportionately; however, degassing the sample and flushing the sample
tubes with helium gas halted such changes. The analysis protocol along
with the annotated characteristic fingerprints for each coenzyme is
provided for easy identification and absolute quantification using
a single internal reference for routine use. The ability to visualize
the ubiquitous coenzymes fundamental to cellular functions, simultaneously
and reliably, offers a new avenue to interrogate the mechanistic details
of cellular function in health and disease.

==== Body
Important
coenzymes NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, oxidized),
NADH (nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide, reduced), NADP+ (nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate, oxidized), and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate, reduced) mediate biochemical reactions fundamental
to cellular functions in health and disease. These coenzymes undergo
reversible oxidation and reduction in numerous electron-transfer reactions,
while the concentration ratios of the reduced and oxidized forms reflect
important cellular functions, including the overall redox status and
regulation of ion channels, cell signaling, cell survival, and death.1−4 This balance is also an important indicator of normal and pathological
conditions including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Investigations
into the metabolism and function of these coenzymes are therefore
of immense interest for uncovering fundamental cellular properties,
including the slowing of aging processes and treatment of diseases.3,5,6 The coenzyme adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) is considered to be the energy currency of living cells as it
fuels a large number of energy-dependent biochemical processes. Adenosine
diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine monophosphate (ADP) are closely associated
with ATP as its precursors/products; hence, the levels of ATP, ADP,
and AMP represent a measure of the energetics of the functioning cells
and their mitochondria.7 Reliable and high-throughput
measurement of the coenzymes of redox reactions and energy, therefore,
is important for investigations focused on the mechanistic understanding
of normal and impaired cellular functions.8

A limited number of analytical methods exist to reliably and
simultaneously
measure the levels of these coenzymes. Currently, the most often-used
methods involve enzymatic assays, which are suboptimal as they necessitate
separate protocols for analysis of each coenzyme or their ratios.9−12 In addition, these assays are often met with challenges due to confounding
factors such as interference from other substances in the sample matrix
and the finite linear range of the assays. Separately, efforts have
been made to simultaneously analyze the coenzymes based on chromatographic
separation and UV–vis absorption13 or detection using targeted mass spectrometry (MS).14,15 While targeted MS typically provides highly sensitive and robust
detection, ion suppression and peak interference make reliable quantification
of these coenzymes challenging. For example, NAD+ and NADP+ can overlap with NADH and NADPH, respectively, due to their
unit mass differences. In addition, in-source fragmentation of ATP
and ADP to AMP poses a major challenge for reliable analysis of these
compounds using MS.15

Nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy offers numerous benefits,
including the ability to reliably identify and simultaneously quantify
many compounds in complex biological mixtures with high reproducibility
and quantification accuracy.16−21 To date, owing to NMR’s ability to detect and quantify metabolites
in vivo, the coenzymes, NAD+, NADH, and ATP, along with
ADP and AMP, have been measured directly or indirectly utilizing in
vivo 31P NMR.22−24 More recently, a method to measure
NAD+ in the rat brain has been shown using in vivo 1H NMR.25 The ability to analyze
the coenzymes in vivo is attractive as it promises better insights;
currently, however, the limited resolution and sensitivity due to
many factors such as chemical shift anisotropy, dipolar, and quadrupolar
interactions, and changes in magnetic susceptibility, deleteriously
affect reliable and simultaneous analysis of the coenzymes by this
approach. In the case of 1H detection in vivo, the need
to suppress the abundant water signal adds to the challenges.

Ex vivo NMR, on the other hand, alleviates many challenges associated
with in vivo NMR and provides highly resolved spectra to enable routine
quantification of metabolites down to submicromolar concentrations
using a single internal reference.26 To
detect the coenzymes, it is necessary to establish their characteristic
fingerprints and, in particular, isolated peaks that can be used for
quantification on a routine basis. The complexity of biological mixtures
combined with the instability of coenzymes, their virtually identical
structures, and low concentrations has so far prevented reliable measurement
of the coenzymes by NMR. In the current study, we have overcome this
bottleneck and provide a simple NMR method to quantify the coenzymes
simultaneously. The outcome is based on comprehensive investigations
of a variety of mouse tissues using both 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy
methods, the development and use of a NMR chemical shift library and
tissue harvesting and extraction method, and spiking with authentic
compounds. As a result, the simultaneous and facile quantification
of seven major coenzymes along with many other metabolites is demonstrated,
using knockout and transgenic mouse models as examples.

Materials and
Methods
Methanol, chloroform, monosodium phosphate (NaH2PO4), disodium phosphate (Na2HPO4), sodium
salt of 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic acid-2,2,3,3-d4 (TSP),
potassium hydroxide, and perchloric acid were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO). Standard compounds used for chemical shift data and/or
spiking experiments were all obtained from Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher
(Waltham, MA), except for the coenzymes, NAD+, NADH, NADP+, and NADPH, which were generously provided by Dr. Jianhai
Du, University of Washington (Table S1).
Deuterium oxide (D2O) was obtained from Cambridge Isotope
laboratories, Inc. (Andover, MA). Deionized (DI) water was purified
using an in-house Synergy Ultrapure Water System from Millipore (Billerica,
MA). All chemicals were used without further purification.

Solutions of
Authentic Compounds for Spiking Experiments/Chemical
Shift Database
One milliliter stock solutions (1 mM) for
standard compounds (Table S1) were prepared
in D2O by diluting their 50 mM solutions, which were first
prepared by weighing each compound and dissolving it in D2O. A 60 μL solution of each compound was mixed with 540 μL
phosphate buffer (0.1 M; pH = 7.45) in D2O containing 50
μM TSP to obtain solutions of 100 μM concentration, which
were then transferred to 5 mm NMR tubes.

Mouse Tissue Separation
and Extraction
The investigations
using mouse tissue were performed with the approval of the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Washington. After
each mouse was anesthetized, heart, kidney, brain, liver, and skeletal
muscle tissues were separated, rinsed in cold phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen (Table S2). Different tissue harvesting and extraction methods were
tested for the mouse heart tissue to determine the optimal method
for the targeted coenzymes. The tissue harvesting procedures employed
included: freeze clamping after 20 min of Langendorff isolated heart
perfusion27 and freeze clamping separated
hearts after washing with a solution in which glucose (10 mM) and
pyruvate (0.5 mM) were present or in cold PBS.

The extraction
procedures included the use of a mixture of methanol and water, perchloric
acid (0.6 N), or methanol and chloroform. For methanol and water extraction,
weighed tissue specimens were mixed with 200 μL cold water and
methanol (1:5 v/v; 4 °C) in 2 mL Eppendorf vials and homogenized
using a Tissue-Tearor hand-held homogenizer. A further 800 μL
cold water/methanol solution (1:5 v/v) was added, each mixture was
then vortexed and incubated on dry ice (−75 °C) for 30
min. Subsequently, the mixtures were sonicated in an ice bath for
10 min and centrifuged for 5 min at 2039 rcf and low temperature (4
°C). The soluble extracts were separated, frozen using dry ice,
and then lyophilized to dryness.

For perchloric acid extraction,
weighed tissue specimens were mixed
with 400 μL cold 0.6 N perchloric acid (4 °C) in 2 mL Eppendorf
vials and homogenized using Tissue-Tearor hand-held homogenizer. Cold
distilled water (400 μL) was added, and each mixture was then
vortexed and incubated on dry ice (−75 °C) for 30 min.
Subsequently, the mixtures were sonicated in an ice bath for 10 min
and centrifuged for 5 min at 2039 rcf and low temperature (4 °C).
The soluble extracts were separated, neutralized using potassium hydroxide,
and the insoluble residue was pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min
at 2039 rcf (4 °C). The soluble extracts were frozen using dry
ice and lyophilized to dryness.

For methanol and chloroform
extractions, weighed tissue specimens
(∼5 to 80 mg) were mixed with a 1 mL mixture of cold methanol
and chloroform (1:2 v/v; 4 °C) in 2 mL Eppendorf vials and homogenized
using a Tissue-Tearor hand-held homogenizer and sonicated for 20 s.
A further 800 μL cold chloroform/distilled water mixture (1:1
v/v) was added, the sample was then vortexed and set aside for 30
min on ice to separate the solvent layers. Next, after centrifugation
at 2039 rcf, the aqueous (top) layer was separated and filtered using
1.5 mL 0.2 μm syringe filters and freeze-dried. To test the
extraction method using recovery experiments, a small set of heart
tissue samples (n = 6) were extracted with or without
spiking with a standard mixture of the coenzymes. The dried extracts
were mixed with 210 or 600 μL of a cold phosphate buffer (0.1
M; pH = 7.45; 4 °C) in D2O containing 25 or 50 μM
TSP. The solutions were transferred to sample tubes for measurements;
3 mm sample tubes were used for 210 μL solutions, and 5 mm sample
tubes were used for 600 μL solutions.

NMR Spectroscopy
Experiments for a few tissue samples
were performed at different temperatures (280, 290, and 298 K) to
ensure that stability of the coenzymes was not affected by their analysis
at room temperature. Subsequently, all NMR experiments were performed
at 298 K. A Bruker Avance III 800 MHz spectrometer equipped with a
cryogenically cooled probe and z-gradients suitable
for inverse detection was used. A few experiments were performed on
a Bruker Avance III 700 MHz spectrometer equipped with a room temperature
probe and z-gradients suitable for inverse detection.
The one-pulse or 1D NOESY pulse sequence with residual water suppression
using presaturation, 10204 Hz (for 800 MHz) or 11160 Hz (for 700 MHz)
spectral width, 6.6 s recycle delay, 128 transients, and 32 K time
domain points were used for 1H 1D NMR experiments. For
tissue extracts, NMR experiments were performed immediately after
preparing the solutions and a second time 24 h after preparing the
solutions to also assess the stability of the redox coenzymes. Separately,
NMR experiments were also performed using degassed NMR solvent (D2O buffer), and sample tubes flushed with helium gas to test
whether oxidation of NADH/NADPH to NAD+/NADP+ could be prevented. After degassing, the sample tubes were sealed
using parafilm, and experiments were performed immediately after preparing
the solutions and a second time 24 h after preparing the solutions.
To aid identification, homonuclear two-dimensional (2D) experiments,
such as 1H–1H double quantum filtered
correlation spectroscopy (DQF-COSY) and 1H–1H total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) experiments, were
performed at 800 MHz for all types of tissue specimens, in addition
to the 1D NMR experiments. The 2D experiments were performed with
suppression of the residual water signal by presaturation during the
relaxation delay. A sweep width of 9600 Hz was used in both dimensions;
512 or 400 FIDs were obtained with t1 increments
for DQF-COSY or TOCSY, respectively, each with 2048 complex data points.
The number of transients used was 8 or 16 for DQF-COSY and 8, 16,
or 24 for TOCSY. The relaxation delay was 2.0, 2.2, or 2.5 s for DQF-COSY
and 1.0, 1.3, or 1.5 s for TOCSY. The resulting 2D data were zero-filled
to 1024 points in the t1 dimension. A
90° shifted squared sine-bell window function was applied to
both dimensions before Fourier transformation. To confirm the assigned
peaks, spectra were also obtained before and after addition of 10–20
μL stock solutions (1 mM) of authentic coenzymes to the tissue
extract solutions. Chemical shifts were referenced to the internal
TSP signal for both the 1H 1D and 2D spectra. Bruker Topspin
versions 3.0 or 3.1 software packages were used for NMR data acquisition,
processing, and analyses.

Peak Assignments, Coenzyme Identification,
and Quantification
Initial peak assignments relied on database
searches,28−30 including the human metabolome database (HMDB)28 and the biological magnetic resonance data bank
(BMRB).29 However, unambiguous identification
of the coenzymes
necessitated the development of a new chemical shift database consisting
of the coenzymes and other compounds in solutions at concentrations
similar to their levels in tissue (Table 1). Spectral peaks for all the coenzymes were
identified using this database along with peak multiplicity, J coupling measurements, and the comprehensive analyses
of 2D DQF-COSY and TOCSY spectra. The coenzymes thus identified were
further confirmed by spiking experiments using authentic compounds.
Chenomx NMR Suite Professional (version 5.1; Chenomx Inc., Edmonton,
Alberta, Canada) was used to quantify the coenzyme peaks. Chenomx
allows fitting spectral lines using the standard metabolite library
for 800 MHz 1H NMR spectra, and in particular, the determination
of concentrations. Since the proximity of chemical shift values for
signals from multiple compounds resulted in the software providing
multiple library hits for the same peak, the correct identification
of coenzymes’ peaks relied on the newly established peak assignments.
Peak fitting with reference to the internal TSP signal enabled the
determination of absolute concentrations of the coenzymes.

Results and Discussion
The 1H NMR spectra from mouse tissues are complex, with
a large number of highly resolved peaks (Figure 1a), and the spectrum for each tissue type,
namely, liver, heart, kidney, brain, and skeletal muscle, is distinct
(Figure S1). Specifically, the region from
∼0.5 to 6.3 ppm is more complex due to contributions from many
small molecule metabolites when compared to the relatively sparse
region from ∼6.5 to 9.5 ppm. On the basis of their structures
and the available chemical shift databases of authentic compounds,28−30 the coenzymes were anticipated to have peaks in both regions of
the spectra (Table 1). Using the chemical shift database that we have newly developed
and comprehensive analyses of 1D and 2D NMR data, unambiguous identification
of the coenzymes, NAD+, NADH, NADP+, NADPH,
and ATP, along with ADP and AMP, in all the types of tissue samples
were made. NMR peaks from the coenzymes that appear below 6.3 ppm
were largely overlapped with each other and with peaks from other
compounds. The region between 6.5 to 9.5 ppm, on the other hand, was
dominated by peaks from the coenzymes, and each coenzyme showed one
or more well-resolved peaks (Figure 1b and Figure S2). Of particular interest is the narrow spectral region between 8.4
to 8.64 ppm; it showed a characteristic, well-resolved peak for each
coenzyme for all the types of tissue studied (Figure 1c and 2). Each of
these characteristic signals arises from the same lone proton of the
five-membered ring of the adenine moiety (Figure 1d and Figure S3).

tissue, and 5 mm sample tubes were used for others.

Considering the challenges associated with the
analysis of the
coenzymes using current methods, the benefits offered by NMR spectroscopy
as an alternative and simple approach are striking. A major limiting
factor for NMR to date, however, has been the inability to obtain
reproducible NMR spectra due to the unstable nature of many coenzymes
and challenges related to sample preparation (Figure 3), as well as a lack of knowledge regarding
their unambiguous identification. The high spectral complexity of
the coenzymes, their similarity in structure, the sensitivity of chemical
shifts to parameters such as concentration, pH, and ionic strength,
and the low concentration, specifically, for some of the coenzymes
have made their unambiguous identification in NMR spectra difficult.
For example, due to the structural similarity, NMR peaks for some
of the coenzymes are virtually indistinguishable. In particular, the
separation between the characteristic C8-proton peaks for
NADH and NADPH is only 0.004 ppm (3.2 Hz) due to their virtually identical
structures (Figure S3). ATP and ADP also
exhibit similar peak characteristics (Figure 1c and Table 1). The sensitivity of the chemical shift to numerous
parameters such as concentration, pH, ionic strength, and temperature
can cause the closely spaced peaks for several coenzymes to interchange
their peak positions in the chemical shift databases of authentic
compounds.28,29 To circumvent this problem, in
this study, we developed a unique NMR chemical shift library for the
coenzymes by maintaining their concentrations similar to their physiological
levels in the tissue extracts, and using solvent, pH, and temperature
conditions identical to those used for the tissue samples (Table 1). Combining this
coenzyme chemical shift database with peak multiplicity and J-couplings,
as well as comprehensive analysis using a series of 1D and 2D DQF-COSY
and TOCSY spectra, characteristic peaks for the coenzymes were unambiguously
identified. Finally, the identified coenzymes were further confirmed
by spiking using authentic compounds.

Figure 3 Portions of 800 MHz 1H NMR
spectra obtained using 3
mm sample tubes highlighting the sensitivity of coenzyme levels to
tissue harvesting/extraction protocols: (a) mouse heart harvested,
washed with glucose/pyruvate solution and freeze clamped, followed
by extraction using methanol-chloroform mixture; (b) mouse heart harvested,
perfused with glucose/pyruvate solution and freeze clamped, followed
by extraction using methanol-chloroform mixture; (c) mouse heart freeze
clamped in vivo, followed by extraction using methanol-chloroform
mixture; and (d) mouse heart harvested, washed with PBS and freeze
clamped, followed by extraction using methanol–water mixture.
Of the prominent changes are the missing NADH/NADPH peaks in (b) and
diminished ATP and enhanced ADP/AMP in (c, d).

For absolute quantification using NMR, the establishment
of the
identity of at least one isolated peak for each coenzyme is critical,
and the 8.4 to 8.64 ppm region fulfills this requirement (Figure 1c). Fortuitously,
within this fingerprint, none of the tissue types exhibited any interference
from other compounds. Furthermore, and importantly, the peaks for
the coenzymes in the fingerprint region are all singlets, as they
all arise from the lone hydrogen atom on the five-membered ring of
the adenine moiety, which is very useful because it provides the best
resolution and sensitivity compared to peak multiplets. This is particularly
critical for identifying the coenzymes that are very closely spaced
and exhibit concentrations of a few ng/mg tissue. Another useful characteristic
of the fingerprint region shown in Figure 1c and Figure 2 is that ratios between various coenzymes can be visualized
directly and simultaneously from their peak heights without resorting
to any calculations, owing to the fact that each coenzyme’s
peak is represented by a single hydrogen atom (Figure S3).

In general, numerous peaks observed for
each coenzyme in different
regions of the same spectra (Table 1 and Figures S1, S2 and S4)
serve to verify their identities, unambiguously, and determine their
concentrations, reliably. In particular, it may be noted that ambiguity
may arise for distinguishing between ATP and ADP when their peaks
overlap or the ATP peak drifts to low frequency toward the ADP peak
as for the heart and skeletal muscle tissues shown in Figures 2 and 3. Such a situation arises especially when the peak intensity for
one of the compounds is overwhelmingly high compared to the other.
In such a case, unambiguous identification and reliable quantification
of ATP and ADP is achieved in combination with other peaks that appear
in different parts of the same spectra that do not overlap with each
other. For example, the spectral region that satisfies this condition
is between ∼4.1 and 4.5 ppm, in which peaks for ATP are well-isolated
from ADP as illustrated in the Figure S4.

It is important to note
that the coenzymes such as NADH, NADPH, and ATP are extremely labile,
and they can evade detection wholly or partly depending on the procedure
used for tissue harvesting/extraction. Using mouse hearts, we evaluated
numerous different tissue harvesting/extraction protocols to assess
their effects on the detection of the coenzymes. As seen in Figure 3, widely varying
results were obtained for different harvesting/extraction conditions.
Quickly washing the harvested tissue with a solution containing glucose
and pyruvate and freeze clamping, followed by extraction using a mixture
of methanol and chloroform provided the best results in terms of peak
areas/concentrations of the detected coenzymes (Figure 3a). Notably, the other protocols resulted
in a significant or complete loss of NADH and NADPH (Figure 3b) or ATP (Figure 3, panels c and d). Subsequent
investigations for heart tissue, in this study, utilized the optimized
protocol as shown for Figure 3a. The robustness of the extraction method can be visualized
from results of a recovery test made by adding a mixture of standard
compounds (Table S3). It may be noted that,
as shown in Figure 2, kidney, brain, and liver tissue exhibited a significant loss of
ATP signals and gain of ADP and AMP signals. These changes are likely
to be due to the fact that tissue from kidney, brain, and liver were
obtained from the same mouse after the heart was separated. Interestingly,
however, although the skeletal muscle was obtained last, it did not
exhibit such changes (Figure 2).

On the basis of the now established peak identity
for each coenzyme
and an optimal harvesting/extraction protocol for mouse heart tissue
(Figure 3a), concentrations
of the redox coenzymes, NAD+, NADH, NADP+, and
NADPH were measured using Chenomx. Simultaneously, concentrations
of ATP, ADP, and AMP were also measured using the same spectra. Typical
concentrations thus obtained for mouse heart tissue are shown in Figure 4. Next we employed
mouse models with disturbed NAD(H) redox balance to test the efficacy
of this approach. Cardiac-specific Ndufs4 knockout
(cKO) mice present inhibited mitochondrial Complex I activity.31 We observed an increase in NADH and the NADH/NAD+ ratio with little change in the NADH/NAD+ pool
in cKO hearts compared to wild-type (WT) (Figure 5). In contrast, the transgenic mice that
overexpress nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (cNAMPT) only in
hearts32 exhibited elevated NAD+ levels and NAD(H) pool size. In addition, cKO mice with cNAMPT expression
showed higher NAD+ levels as well as NAD(H) pool size but
lower NADH/NAD+ ratios than those in cKO mice (Figure 5b). These changes
are illustrated in Figure 5a as portions of representative NMR spectra highlighting the
NAD+ and NADH peaks for different genetic variants and
the corresponding concentrations shown in Figure 5b. The results from cKO and cNAMPT hearts
are consistent with the literature31,32 and indicate
that the new approach will be a useful tool to the investigations
of a number of diseases.

NADP+, and NADPH in heart tissue of wild type mice (n = 6) obtained in a single step using the 1H
NMR spectroscopy method.

Figure 5 (a) Portions of typical 800 MHz NMR spectra of heart tissue extracts

cKO/cNAMPT mice and (b) the corresponding concentrations (ng/mg) in
the cardiac tissues shown in (a).

More generally, this approach is applicable for all tissue
types
and enables absolute quantification of the seven coenzymes including
the NAD(H) and NADP(H) redox couples in a single experiment, which
is important to assess the biological significance of their levels
in health and disease. In contrast, the established enzymatic assays
increase the likelihood of errors due to the requirement of separate
sample preparation steps for their measurement, individually. Further,
because the NMR approach offers the ability to see each coenzyme peak
with the naked eye, it offers a new avenue to evaluate the quality
of extraction, simultaneously, which is critical considering the sensitivity
of many coenzymes to the extraction protocol used (Figure 3).

Using the NMR approach,
the time and temperature dependences of
the coenzymes were evaluated to assess their stability in solution.
The results show that apart from small chemical shift changes, the
coenzymes did not show any effect of temperature in the range of 280–298
K. Hence, 298 K was chosen for investigations in this study. Time-dependent
analysis, however, showed that the levels of the reduced forms of
the coenzymes, NADH and NADPH, decreased with time and the levels
of their oxidized forms, NAD+ and NADP+, increased,
proportionately. Over a period of 24 h after preparation of the solutions,
roughly 50% or more of the NADH and NADPH levels were reduced (Figure S5). Interestingly, however, degassing
the NMR solvent and flushing the sample tube with helium gas, followed
by sealing the tube with Parafilm, prevented such a change (Figure S6). These results indicate the somewhat
unstable nature of NADH and NADPH in solution in the presence of oxygen
and highlight the need to analyze the samples as soon as the solutions
are made, or otherwise degas the solvent and the sample tube using
an inert gas.

In this study, about 5 to 80 mg tissue was used
to develop the
NMR method for simultaneous analysis of the coenzymes within a 10
to 15 min analysis time. The phosphorylated redox coenzymes NADP+ and NADPH, which are generally found at much lower concentrations
(a few ng/mg tissue) compared to the other coenzymes, benefit from
using large amount of tissue. On the basis of the results, however,
the other coenzymes with larger signals (typically 10-fold, Figure 4) can be quantified
using <10 mg tissue (Figure S7). Further,
utilizing sensitivity enhancement approaches, such as with additional
signal averaging or utilizing microcoil probes, the detection limit
can be reduced further to enable the analysis of smaller amounts of
biological samples (<5 mg) for absolute concentrations of all the
coenzymes.

In conclusion, we demonstrate a simple method for
the simultaneous
quantification of the major coenzymes of cellular energy and redox
reactions: NAD+, NADH, NADP+, NADPH, and ATP
along with ADP and AMP using 1H NMR spectroscopy. Considering
that the balance between the redox coenzymes play critical roles in
various cellular functions, their involvement in electron shuttling
in oxidation reduction reactions,5 and
the challenges associated with the established analysis methods, the
ability of an NMR method to visualize cellular levels of the coenzymes
represents a significant step for mechanistic understanding of cellular
metabolism in health and disease. A one-step detection of the coenzymes
is demonstrated for different types of mouse tissue with the goal
of evaluating the utility of the method for a wide range of biological
specimens. As an example of the utility of this method, the sensitivity
of coenzymes NAD+ and NADH to different mouse tissue genotypes
is demonstrated. Experimental protocols along with the annotated spectral
fingerprints of the coenzymes provided here enable their easy identification
and simultaneous quantification using a single internal reference.
An added advantage of this method is that it not only enables analysis
of the coenzymes but also enables analysis of a large number of other
small molecule metabolites, simultaneously, from the same NMR data
without the need for additional sample or experiments (Figure S8), as we have demonstrated recently
for human blood.26 The time-dependent studies
indicate the gradual oxidation of NADH and NADPH to NAD+ and NADP+, respectively, in solution at room temperature,
which points to the need to analyze them as soon as the solutions
are made. Alternatively, degassing the NMR solution and flushing the
NMR tubes using an inert gas such as helium, followed by sealing the
tube, can provide reliable quantification. This is the first successful
effort providing the absolute quantification of major coenzymes of
cellular redox reactions and cellular energy, simultaneously, and
this approach is anticipated to find widespread utility for investigations
of cellular function.
