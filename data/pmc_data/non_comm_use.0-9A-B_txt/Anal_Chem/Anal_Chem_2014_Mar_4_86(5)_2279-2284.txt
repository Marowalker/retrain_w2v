The sensitive detection of highly
toxic botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT)
from Clostridium botulinum is of critical importance
because it causes human illnesses if foodborne or introduced in wounds
and as an iatrogenic substance. Moreover, it has been recently considered
a possible biological warfare agent. Over the past decade, significant
progress has been made in BoNT detection technologies, including mouse
lethality assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and endopeptidase
assays and by mass spectrometry. Critical assay requirements, including
rapid assay, active toxin detection, sensitive and accurate detection,
still remain challenging. Here, we present a novel method to detect
active BoNTs using a Glyco-quantitative polymerase chain-reaction
(qPCR) approach. Sialyllactose, which interacts with the binding-domain
of BoNTs, is incorporated into a sialyllactose-DNA conjugate as a
binding-probe for active BoNT and recovered through BoNT-immunoprecipitation.
Glyco-qPCR analysis of the bound sialyllactose-DNA is then used to
detect low attomolar concentrations of BoNT and attomolar to femtomolar
concentrations of BoNT in honey, the most common foodborne source
of infant botulism.

==== Body
The botulinum
neurotoxins (BoNTs),
which are the most poisonous toxins known, are produced by the strictly
anaerobic gram-positive bacillus, C. botulinum, as
single inactive polypetide chains of ∼150 kDa. These polypeptides
are then cleaved by tissue proteinases into two chains: a heavy (H)
chain of ∼100 kDa and a light (L) chain of ∼50 kDa linked
by a single disulfide bond. This active form of these toxins has proteinase
and lectin activities and causes botulism, a fatal disease of the
nervous system of humans and other mammals.1 The classic food-borne botulism occurs after ingestion of food containing
preformed neurotoxin, produced by C. botulinum that
contaminate inadequately processed food such as home-canned foodstuffs
processed at temperatures below 120 °C.2 Food-borne botulism in the United States is now uncommon as most
of canned foods consumed at home are commercially prepared. Infant
botulism has become the most common form of botulism reported in the
United States. Between 1976 and 1996, 1442 cases of infant botulism
were reported to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Infant
botulism occurs because infants produce reduced amounts of bile acids,
which inhibit the germination of C. botulinum spores,
within the gastrointestinal tract when compared to the bile acids
formed in an adult, and infant intestinal flora is immature.3 Honey consumption has been associated with a
number of cases of infant botulism since 15–25% of honey products
harbor botulinum spores (especially type B).4 Recently, the new serotype of the toxin-type H, from an infant botulism
patient, was by the Arnon group5,6 and added to the other
seven known serotypes, BoNT/A, B, C1, C2, D, E, F, and G. Although
this new toxin’s DNA sequence will be added to a public database,7 there is still no effective treatment.5 BoNTs are also considered high-priority biological
agents that are easily produced and could be used in terrorist attacks
against food supplies.8 BoNTs are highly
toxic, with estimated inhalation and oral lethal doses in humans of
approximately 10 ng/kg and 1 μg/kg body weight, respectively.9 Ironically, highly toxic BoNTs are used in many
human therapeutic and cosmetic applications,10 and there has been concerns that patients might be treated with
higher than recommended doses of unsuitable BoNT preparations by unlicensed
practitioners.11 Thus, development of highly
sensitive, simple, and rapid methods to detect active BoNT, not only
in foods, but also patient specimens are required for protecting consumers
of BoNT-containing foodstuffs, patients from BoNT-containing therapeutics,
and civilians and military personnel from bioterrorism. C.
botulinum cells or spores can be sensitively detected using
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but the detection of BoNT proteins
is considerably less sensitive because of the lack of similar molecular
amplification tools. The current standard for measuring active BoNT
is a live-mouse bioassay, which can detect as little as 5–30
pg of active BoNT.12 However, the mouse
bioassay is expensive to perform, requires many animals, and can take
several days to obtain results. Assays that detect the intrinsic endopeptidase
activity of BoNT have also been developed for detecting active BoNT.13 Recently, the Kalkum group developed an assay
with a large immunosorbent surface area (ALISSA) that could concentrate
the zinc-dependent metalloprotease protease located in 50 kDa L-chain
of BoNT and monitor the conversion of fluorogenic peptide substrates
by the intrinsic endopeptidase activity of bead-captured BoNT.14 Using the ALLISSA, attomolar detection of BoNT-A
was possible.14,15 DNA represents an outstanding
marker because it is easily amplified using either normal or real
time-PCR amplification16 and offers a potentially
highly sensitive alternative to the use of expensive fluorogenic peptide
substrates for signal amplification.

Previously, we reported
the use of Glyco-qPCR to detect zmol amounts
of carbohydrates.17 This method can also
use carbohydrate conjugates with DNA markers to quantitatively analyze
protein–carbohydrate interactions. Here, we demonstrate a novel
highly sensitive method for detecting active BoNT/B spiked into honey
by combining immunoprecipitation with Glyco-qPCR.

Results and Discussion
Strategy
for Detecting Small Amounts of BoNT in Test Samples
BoNTs
are composed of three domains including the L-chain, the
translocation domain (HN), and the binding domain (HC). The Zn-protease in L-chain (∼50 kDa) specifically
cleaves the soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins
and inhibits acetylcholine release at the neuromolecular junctions.18 HN is responsible for transport of
the L-chain over the endosomal membrane. HC binds to receptors
on nerve terminals.19 BoNTs achieve their
high affinity and specificity for neurons by binding to disialogangliosides
and trisialogangliosides (i.e., GD1a, GT1b, and GD1b). Gangliosides
bind in ganglioside-binding site (SXWY motif in HC) conserved
in all serotypes except for BoNT/C and D.20,21 The crystal structure of BoNT/B in complex with SL, a partial mimic
of a ganglioside, has been used to model the interactions between
the sugar moieties of the ganglioside and its BoNT binding domain.21 We used the SL-BoNT interaction for detecting
active BoNT because SL binds to active BoNT but not to inactive BoNT.
In addition, DNA has been used as sensitive barcodes due to the tremendous
amplification power of PCR.16 Thus, we
synthesized SL-DNA conjugate as a BoNT detection probe (Figure 1A). The reducing end of the glucose residue in SL
was conjugated with 5′-amine-terminated DNA marker using reductive
amination,17 after preparing the 5′-amine-terminated
DNA marker with PCR amplification and obtaining a qPCR standard curve
for quantifying the amounts of DNA (Supporting
Information Figure S1). The conjugates of SL-DNA marker could
be used as a detection probe for binding BoNT, and the modification
of the glucose residue of SL does not influence the affinity for BoNT.21−24 The overall schematic for detecting small amounts of BoNT is illustrated
in Figure 1B. First, the BoNTs spiked into
test sample mixture are recovered using the antibodies against the
heavy H-chain, HN and HC (∼100 kDa) of
BoNT. The BoNT H domain is captured by antibody since SL interacts
with HC domain not the L-chain (∼50 kDa) of BoNT.
Second, the SL-DNA conjugate is bound to the BoNT immobilized on beads
in the form of a BoNT-SL-DNA complex. After washing the immobilized
BoNT beads 5-times with PBS to remove unbound SL-DNA conjugates as
well as residual unreacted DNA (Figure 1B),
the washed beads are then used as a template for qPCR. Finally, the
DNA marker conjugated with SL was amplified, resulting in increased
fluorescence based on the SL–BoNT interaction. This assay approach
offers several advantages, including heightened detection sensitivity,
the potential for online monitoring, no need for postreaction analyses,
and a reduced risk of contamination.

Detection Limit of BoNT/B
Deionized water solutions,
containing different amounts of BoNT/B (from 600 fM to 6 aM) and a
negative control (600 fM of denatured BoNT/B), were prepared using
serial dilutions to determine the detection limit for BoNT/B. The
samples were bound with excess amounts of BoNT/B specific antibody
(BTBH-N1, 10 pM), which interacts with a heavy chain of BoNT/B.25 At this time, we also performed an SL-inhibition
study using ELISA to demonstrate that different epitopes are bound
to the BoNT/B antibody interacting with SL (Supporting
Information Figure S2). Thus, the binding of antibody (BTBH-N1)
did not influence the affinity of SL binding to BoNT/B, which was
consistent with our previous results.25 The BoNT/B-antibody complex was then pulled down using protein A-Sepharose
beads. The SL binding site of recovered BoNT allowed SL-DNA conjugates
to form BoNT-SL-DNA complex. The complex was then used as a template
for qPCR. Glyco-qPCR analysis detected as little as 6 aM concentrations
of BoNT (6 × 10–18 M, Figure 2A). The average cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained by qPCR
was determined as a function of the log of the number of BoNT/B molecules
per plate well for three replicate Glyco-qPCR measurements on BoNT/B
in deionized water (Supporting Information Figure S3). This is 107-fold more sensitive than the
60 pM (6 × 10–11 M) detection limit of ELISA
(Figure 2B). Exceptionally sensitive detection
was achieved despite the relatively weak binding affinity between
SL and BoNT/B (KD = ∼0.1 μM).26 This unexpectedly high sensitivity can be explained
based on the following reasons. First, this two-phase assay concentrates
BoNT/B (∼6 amol) on the surface of beads. We estimate the local
concentration of BoNT/B using eq 1. 1  

Figure 2 Detection limit of BoNT/B using Glyco-qPCR and
ELISA assay: (A)
Glyco-qPCR amplification plots of BoNT/B-SL-DNA complex. Different
amounts of BoNT/B and denatured BoNT/B as a negative control were
used to determine detection limitation. All samples and controls were
amplified in triplicate. (B) Immunoassay for BoNT/B with sequential
binding of BoNT/B-specific monoclonal antibody (BTBH-N1) and HRP-conjugated
goat antimouse IgG1. Statistical analysis was performed, and the results
were indicated as ∗ for P < 0.05 and ∗∗∗
for P < 0.001. No indication means P > 0.05. All samples and controls were amplified in triplicate.

The volume of BoNT bead complex
was estimated from the length of
an antibody (∼8 nm),27 the length
of BoNT/B-antibody complex (∼15 nm),28 and the average diameter of beads (50 μm). An elevated local
concentration of BoNT/B (∼0.3 nM) results from the colocalized
volume (∼0.1 nL/bead) and number of beads used (∼200)
in spite of the small amount of BoNT present. Similarly, elevated
local concentrations (∼0.6 mM) of both SL-DNA conjugates and
antibody results from their colocalization in this two-phase assay,
which promotes the effective binding of small amounts of BoNT/B. However,
this elevated local concentration (∼0.3 nM) of BoNT/B is still
insufficient to ensure SL binding to BoNT/B, assuming a binding affinity
of ∼0.1 μM.26 Thus, we suggest
a second reason for the enhanced binding affinity of SL-DNA conjugate,
relative to SL for BoNT/B, resulting from an ionic interaction between
DNA and BoNT/B (Supporting Information Figure
S4). Numerous positively charged residues (K1225, K1226, K1260, K1264,
K1267, R1268, K1269, K1274, P1283, K1284) flank the SL-binding site
of BoNT/B. The high negative charge of the DNA in the SL-DNA conjugate
contributes to this interaction, enhancing binding affinity. Previous
reports29 show that during the binding
of BoNT/B to ganglioside on the surface of presynaptic membrane, this
positive charged loop on BoNT/B is closely oriented toward negative
charged membrane, supporting this hypothesis. Thus, we suggest that
both high local concentration in this two-phase assay and charge interaction
between BoNT/B and SL-DNA synergistically contribute to elevate binding
affinity, resulting in ultrasensitive detection of BoNT/B. Glyco-qPCR
also shows comparable sensitivity to an ultrasensitive liposome-PCR
immunoassay for detecting biotoxins that relies on liposomes with
encapsulated DNA reporters, and ganglioside receptors embedded in
the bilayer, as a detection reagent. In this ultrasensitive liposome-PCR
immunoassay, after capturing the target biotoxin by an antibody and
cobinding the ganglioside-embedded liposomes, the liposomes are ruptured
to release the reporter DNA, which are then quantified by real-time
PCR.24 However, the preparation of ganglioside-embedded
liposomes is a very expensive process and a high background signal
can occur due to the nonspecific binding of liposomes.30 In contrast to liposome-PCR immunoassay, Glyco-PCR
represents a simpler method for the ultrasensitive detection of BoNT/B.

Detection of BoNT/B in Honey
Encouraged by the highly
sensitive detection of BoNT/B, we examined the detection of BoNT subtypes
(60 fM of BoNT/B) in food using Glyco-PCR. We selected to detect BoNT/B
in honey because it represents the major source of infant botulism,
resulting from the absorption of heat-labile neurotoxin produced in situ by C. botulism colonizing the intestines
of infants younger than 1-year of age.4,31 The critical
values (Ct) of qPCR were dependent on the BoNT/B concentration in
honey (Supporting Information Figure S5A).
The detection sensitivity of 60 fM of BoNT/B (Ct = 17.5) in honey
was ∼10-fold lower than that (6 fM of BoNT/B; Ct = 17.9) observed
in deionized water, based on the Ct plot from deionized water (Supporting Information Figure S3). The average
Ct values from multiple replicate Glyco-qPCR measurements of BoNT/B
in honey are shown in Supporting Information Figure S5B. These results indicate that 60 fM levels of BoNT could
be determined in honey, but that these data were statistical unreliable
at 6 fM. In addition, a false positive signal was observed in the
negative control (denatured BoNTs). The reduced sensitivity might
result from inefficient immunoprecipitation and/or competitive inhibition
by the sugars present at high concentrations in honey.

We next
synthesized multivalent SL-DNA conjugates (10) starting
from pentaerythritol (1) (Figure 3A), since polyvalent interactions can be collectively much stronger
than corresponding monovalent interactions.32 Detailed experimental procedures are described in the Supporting Information and Figures S6–S9.
After immunoprecipitating different concentrations of BoNT/B in honey,
multivalent SL-DNA conjugates were bound to BoNT/B-antibody complex
on beads and washed 5-times for removing the unbound SL-DNA conjugates.
The BoNT/B bound multivalent SL-DNA complex was then analyzed by Glyco-qPCR
(Figure 3B). Compared to monovalent SL-DNA
conjugates, multivalent interaction of SL improved the affinity for
BoNT/B, avoiding false positive signals and increasing the detection
sensitivity to 600 aM BoNT/B in honey (Figure 3B).

Conclusion
We demonstrate a simple and inexpensive
method for high specificity
and attomolar sensitivity detection of active BoNT/B in both PBS and
honey through the dual binding of antibodies and monovalent or multivalent
SL-DNA conjugates to toxins. Conjugation of specific glycans with
DNA marker can be used as detection probes for determining various
toxic proteins, including ones with potential use in biological warfare
agents. Glyco-qPCR is a particularly general detection method because
many toxins, viruses, and pathogens interact with the specific glycans
on the surface of cells.23 In addition,
since glycans only interact with active toxic proteins (detection
targets), Glyco-qPCR with multivalent SL-DNA conjugates can also reduce
false positive signals resulting from denatured target proteins, which
are commonly detected by immuno-PCR methods.33
