Mass
spectrometry (MS) has become an indispensable tool for investigating
the architectures and dynamics of macromolecular assemblies. Here
we show that covalent labeling of solvent accessible residues followed
by their MS-based identification yields modeling restraints that allow
mapping the location and orientation of subunits within protein assemblies.
Together with complementary restraints derived from cross-linking
and native MS, we built native-like models of four heterocomplexes
with known subunit structures and compared them with available X-ray
crystal structures. The results demonstrated that covalent labeling
followed by MS markedly increased the predictive power of the integrative
modeling strategy enabling more accurate protein assembly models.
We applied this strategy to the F-type ATP synthase from spinach chloroplasts
(cATPase) providing a structural basis for its function as a nanomotor.
By subjecting the models generated by our restraint-based strategy
to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we revealed the conformational
states of the peripheral stalk and assigned flexible regions in the
enzyme. Our strategy can readily incorporate complementary chemical
labeling strategies and we anticipate that it will be applicable to
many other systems providing new insights into the structure and function
of protein complexes.

==== Body
Mass spectrometry
(MS) is an
emerging technique in biophysics, and in the last two decades, it
has gained in importance when studying the structure and dynamics
of macromolecular protein assemblies.1 Particularly
those assemblies which exhibit a certain flexibility and heterogeneity
or undergo dynamic interactions with their ligands are the primary
targets of structural MS.2 Various MS techniques
each addressing a different question have evolved and are now commonly
employed to gain information on composition, stoichiometry, topology,
conformation and dynamics.

Most commonly applied is chemical
cross-linking,3−5 a technique
which involves covalent linkage of two amino acid side chains in close
proximity thus allowing the identification of protein interactions
by sequencing the cross-linked dipeptides after enzymatic digestion.
MS of intact protein complexes, also called native MS, delivers protein
stoichiometries and stable interaction modules enabling the generation
of protein interaction networks.6,7 Together with ion mobility
(IM), native MS yields conformation and topology of proteins and their
complexes.8−10 Combining complementary information from chemical
cross-linking and native MS delivers valuable insights into the structural
arrangements of protein complexes.11−13

While cross-linking
and native MS identify protein interactions,
labeling strategies such as covalent labeling14 or hydrogen–deuterium exchange (HDX)15,16 explore solvent accessible surfaces of protein–ligand assemblies.
This is of particular interest when studying the dynamics of proteins
and their conformational changes,17,18 for instance
upon ligand binding.19 HDX utilizes the
ability of protons to be exchanged with deuterium in solution. The
slow exchange rate of protein backbone amide protons causes a mass
shift of the protein/peptide, which can be probed by MS. Likewise,
chemical labeling approaches introduce modifications to amino acid
side chains which can be identified by standard proteomics. Very prominent
is hydroxyl radical footprinting involving oxidation of various amino
acid side chains.20 Other labeling strategies
employ chemical reagents which are reactive toward specific amino
acid side chains.14

Diethylpyrocarbonate
(DEPC), employed in this study, was initially
used to modify histidine residues. However, DEPC also modifies, with
different reactivity, lysine, arginine, tyrosine, threonine and cysteine
residues.21,22 It is an efficient labeling reagent and
can probe up to 30% of the protein amino acid sequence. Under acidic
and basic conditions or in the presence of nucleophiles, however,
DEPC labeling is reversible23 and experimental
conditions have to be carefully optimized.24

Structural modeling of proteins and their assemblies includes
various
computational techniques such as homology modeling, coarse-grained
modeling, docking studies or structure prediction.25−28 In addition, computational simulations
can improve our understanding on the dynamic behavior of proteins
and their ligands in solution29 or in the
gas phase.30 The combination of MS approaches
and computational methods is increasingly used to study protein complex
structures and dynamics. Recent success of hybrid approaches is demonstrated
by novel structures of the proteasome,31,32 the ribosome,33,34 eukaryotic initiation factors,35,36 amyloid oligomers,37 and ATP synthases.38 A milestone in integrative analysis was the merging of complementary
methods39 and their integration with molecular
electron microscopy (EM) maps35 enabling
atomic-level characterization of protein complexes.

We introduce
a strategy to study protein complex dynamics by extending
the structural toolbox and integrating covalent labeling, cross-linking
and native MS with computational modeling. For this, we convert the
respective MS data into modeling restraints, which in turn were used
to inform a scoring function for generating candidate model structures,
while we analyze the prospective models using molecular dynamic simulations
(Figure 1). We exemplify
this strategy on four well-characterized protein complexes, tryptophan
synthase, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS), the RvB1/RvB2 complex
and the catalytic core of cATPase, for which crystal structures are
available (Figure S1). We then utilize
available information from previous studies together with novel findings
on surface accessibility obtained here from covalent labeling and
generate a model of the intact F-type ATP synthase purified from spinach
chloroplasts. We also subject the top-scoring model to molecular dynamics
simulations and identified dynamic and flexible regions within the
macromolecular assembly, delivering insights into its function as
a nanomotor. The strategy described here is applicable to any protein
assembly and provides new opportunities in structural biology linking
macromolecular models and their structural dynamics.

Experimental Section
Protein Purification
Purified tryptophan synthase was
a gift of I. Schlichting, Max Planck Institute for Medical Research,
Heidelberg, Germany. The RvB1/RvB2 complex was a gift of Karl-Peter
Hopfner, Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich, Germany. CPS was provided
by F. Raushel, Texas A&M University, College Station. cATPase
was purified from spinach leaves and reconstituted in DDM detergent
micelles as described previously.12,40

DEPC Labeling
Approximately 10 μM of the purified
protein complexes were incubated with 8.75, 17.5, 35, or 70 μM
DEPC for 1 min at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched by addition
of 10 mM imidazole. After quenching the reaction mixture was kept
on ice. The proteins were then precipitated with ethanol for 2 h and
subsequently digested with trypsin in the presence of RapiGest (Waters)
according to manufacturer’s protocols.

LC-MS/MS
Dried
peptides of cATPase and tryptophan synthase
were dissolved in 1% (v/v) formic acid and separated by nanoflow-liquid
chromatography on an Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLC nano System (Thermo
Scientific); mobile phase A, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (FA); mobile phase
B, 80% (v/v) acetonitrile 0.1% (v/v) FA. The peptides were loaded
onto a precolumn (HPLC column Acclaim PepMap 100, C18, 100 μm
I.D. particle size 5 μm; Thermo Scientific) and separated on
an analytical column (50 cm, HPLC column Acclaim PepMap 100, C18,
75 μm I.D. particle size 3 μm; Thermo Scientific) at a
flow rate of 300 nL/min with a gradient of 5–80% solvent B
over 80 min. Peptides were directly eluted into an LTQ-Orbitrap XL
hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).

MS conditions
were: spray voltage of 1.6 kV; capillary temperature of 180 °C;
normalized collision energy 35% (q = 0.25, activation
time 30 ms). The LTQ-Orbitrap XL was operated in data-dependent mode.
MS spectra were acquired in the orbitrap (m/z 300–2000) with a resolution of 30 000 at m/z 400 and an automatic gain control target
of 106. The five most intense ions were selected for CID
fragmentation in the linear ion trap at an automatic gain control
target of 30 000. Previously selected ions were dynamically
excluded for 30 s. Singly charged ions as well as ions with unrecognized
charge state were also excluded. Internal calibration of the orbitrap
was performed using the lock mass option.41

Peptides and labeled sites were identified using MassMatrix
Database
Search Engine.70 Search parameters were
as follows: tryptic peptides with a maximum of two missed cleavage
sites; carbamidomethylation of cysteine, oxidation of methionine and
DEPC-labeled serine, threonine, tyrosine and histidine as variable
modifications; mass accuracy filter, 10 ppm for precursor ions, 0.8
Da for fragment ions; minimum pp and pp2 values 5.0, minimum pptag
1.3.

Dried peptides of RvB1/2 and CPS complexes were dissolved
in 2%
(v/v) ACN, 0.1% FA and separated by nanoflow-liquid chromatography
on an Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLC nano System (Thermo Scientific); mobile
phase A, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (FA); mobile phase B, 80% (v/v) acetonitrile/0.1%
(v/v) FA. The peptides were loaded onto a precolumn (HPLC column Acclaim
PepMap 100, C18, 100 μm I.D. particle size 5 μm; Thermo
Scientific) and separated on an analytical column (50 cm, HPLC column
Acclaim PepMap 100, C18, 75 μm I.D. particle size 3 μm;
Thermo Scientific) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min with a gradient of
8–90% solvent B over 62 min. Peptides were directly eluted
into a Q Exactive Plus Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer
(Thermo Scientific).

MS conditions were as follows: spray voltage
of 1.6 kV; capillary
temperature of 250 °C; normalized collision energy 30. The Q
Exactive Plus mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode.
MS spectra were acquired in the orbitrap (m/z 350–1600) with a resolution of 70 000 and
an automatic gain control target of 3 × 106. The 20
most intense ions were selected for HCD fragmentation in HCD at an
automatic gain control target of 1 × 105. Previously
selected ions were dynamically excluded for 30 s. Singly charged ions,
as well as ions with unrecognized charge state, were also excluded.
Internal calibration of the orbitrap was performed using the lock
mass option.41

Peptides and labeled
sites were identified using Mascot Search
Engine v2.3.02. Search parameters were: Tryptic peptides with a maximum
of two missed cleavage sites. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine, oxidation
of methionine and DEPC-labeled serine, threonine, tyrosine, and histidine
as variable modifications. Mass accuracy filter: 10 ppm for precursor
ions, 0.02 Da for fragment ions.

Chemical Cross-Linking
of Tryptophan Synthase
Twenty
microliters of 20 μM tryptophan synthase were incubated with
20 μL of 2.5 mM bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) cross-linker
for 1 h at 25 °C at 350 rpm in a thermomixer. After cross-linking,
proteins were precipitated with ethanol and digested with trypsin
in the presence of RapiGest (Waters) according to manufacturer’s
protocols. Cross-linked peptides were further separated using SCX
Stage Tips (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Peptides were then analyzed by MS and identified as described
previously.12

Chemical Cross-Linking
of CPS and RvB1/B2 Complexes
Ten microliters of 10 μM
CPS and 5 μL of 25 μM
RvB1/2 were incubated with various concentrations of BS3 cross-linker
(final concentrations = 0.5, 0.83, and 1.25 mM) for 1 h at 25 °C
at 350 rpm in a thermomixer. Cross-linked proteins were separated
by gel electrophoresis (NuPAGE, Invitrogen) and digested in gel as
described.42 Peptides were then analyzed
by MS and identified as described previously.12

Native Mass Spectrometry
Native MS experiments on tryptophan
synthase, CPS, and RvB1/2 were performed on a quadrupole time-of-flight
mass spectrometer (Synapt G2Si HDMS, Waters Corp., Manchester, UK).
Ten micromolar purified sample was buffer-exchanged in 200 mM ammonium
acetate and electrosprayed using gold coated glass capillaries prepared
in-house.43 Typical MS parameters were
capillary voltage 1.5–1.7 kV, sampling cone voltage 25–40
V, collision voltage 20 V, bias voltage 20 V, trap collision energy
5 V. MS spectra were processed and analyzed using Masslynx 4.1 (Waters).
The spectra were calibrated externally using CsI. Backing pressure:
3.84 mbar. Trap: 0.04 mbar. Helium cell: 3.5 mbar. IMS: 2.6 mbar.

In solution disruption was performed by addition of an organic solvent
to the protein complex in ammonium acetate (AA) buffer as described
elsewhere.44 Subcomplexes were generated
using 10–40% methanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and acetonitrile
(ACN).

Modeling Restraints from Covalent-Labeling MS
Solvent
accessibility information from covalent labeling followed by MS was
converted into modeling restraints using in-house developed code (https://github.com/apolitis/covalent_labelling_MS). This code iteratively estimates the solvent accessible surface
area (SASA) for each residue within all models generated using our
sampling algorithm. To calculate the SASA on the surface of each residue
we simulated the rolling motion of sphere using a solvent accessible
surface function (see Figure S-3). In this
function the probe radius of the sphere was 1.8 Å and 5.0 sampling
density/ Å2 for area estimation. The function uses
a set of nodal points attributed by xyz coordinates
and radius to compute the SASA values. Overall, we report a dimensionless
SASA ratio defined as  The returned SASA value
per residue is implemented
as a structural restraint using a threshold value of 0.25, where if
SASAx > 0.25, then the residue x is exposed, or if SASAx <
0.25, then the residue x is buried, where x denotes the amino-acid residue.

We iteratively applied
this algorithm to all structural models of cATPase, tryptophan synthase,
CPS, and RvB1/B2 generated using our Monte Carlo-based strategy. Briefly,
we used the list of labeled residues from our covalent labeling mass
spectrometry experiments (Tables S4–S7) to interrogate the structural models by satisfaction of modeling
restraints. A model was considered if it satisfies the restraint for
a specific labeled residue x (histidine, threonine,
tyrosine or serine) when the SASA for this residue is greater than
0.25, whereas it violates such restraint for SASA if less than 0.25.
For each model structure generated we examined all restraints corresponding
to labeled residues and the total score was calculated as  where SSASA,i is the score for each model structure i (i = 1, 2, 3, ...) which takes values
0 or 1, RS
the number of covalent labeling restraints satisfied in the structure
and RT the number of all restraints used, which correspond to the
labeled residues from covalent labeling experiments.

The SASA
scoring algorithm was implemented within the Integrative
Modelling Platform (IMP).25

Integrative
Modeling
We used an integrative modeling
strategy for MS data.36,39 Structural models of the assemblies
were generated using a Monte Carlo search algorithm developed in-house
and implemented into IMP.25 The model building
was guided by a scoring function, which estimates the probability
of a structural model given existing knowledge of the investigated
system and the MS data acquired. The posterior probability P(M|DMS, PI)
for MS Data (DMS) and prior information
(PI) is  where P(M|PI) is the prior, the probability of
a model given only existing
information on the system and P(DMS|M, PI) is the likelihood function,
expressed as the probability of observing MS data given a structural
model and knowledge of the system in question. The score is calculated
as the negative logarithm of the likelihood and the existing information
(called prior)  The most likely structural model scores higher
according to the posterior distribution. The prior P(M|PI) is the prior probability P(M) accounting for intersubunit connectivities,
solvent accessibility, distance restraints and an additional parameter
composed of uncertainties; these are the false positives for native
MS, cross-linking and covalent labeling MS. The likelihood function P(DMS|M, PI)
for a data point of a data set D of experimentally
measured connectivites (native MS, cross-linking MS), distance restraints
(cross-linking MS) and solvent accessibilities (CL-MS) is given as  where Y is the structure
coordinates, σn the uncertainty,
αn denotes other parameters, such
as ambiguities due to flexibilities, and ω is the weight. The
forward function (fn)
predicts the data points, that is, randomly picking a residue that
is solvent exposed for a given time point in the experimental measurement
(CL-MS) and adopts a conformation consistent with the given connectivities
and distance restraints. The uncertainty corresponds to the data points
from both measurements that are inconsistent with the structure Y.

We judged the uniqueness of the ensemble of generated
models by performing ensemble analysis (e.g., clustering of best-ranking
solutions), and the final solution was selected from the major cluster.44 The Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) and the
UCSF Chimera packages were used for visualization of the model structures.45

Distance Restraints from Cross-Linking MS
Upper bound
distance restraints (35 Å) specified from the identified cross-links
by applying a cross-linking strategy followed by MS.36,42 The individual links were implemented into our modeling approach
enabling us to guide the search for candidate model structures that
fit the input MS data.

Simulations in Explicit Solvent
Explicit solvent MD
of the ATPase protein complex were performed and analyzed using the
GROMACS 4.6 program46 using the Amber99sb*-ildn
force field parameters.47 The input structure
of the F1 cATPase was assembled from its individual components (crystal
structure and homology models) using an MS-restrained strategy as
described elsewhere.39 The initial complex
structure, consisting of 56,826 protein heavy atoms, was solvated
and minimized in a dodecahedral periodic box of 952 838 TIP3P
water molecules48 with a minimum distance
of 1.0 nm between any protein atom and the periodic box. The system
charge was neutralized by adding 75 sodium counterions to the solvent.
The equations of motion were integrated using the leapfrog method49 with a 2 fs time step. The equilibration protocol
hereafter outlined was used: an initial 500 steps of steepest descent
energy minimization in solution. This was followed by an equilibration
of the system in the canonical ensemble with harmonic positional restraints
on the protein heavy atoms using a force constant of 10 000
kJ/mol/nm2 and gradually reduced to 1000 kJ/mol/nm2, while increasing the temperature from 50 to 300 K at a constant
volume. During this NVT ensemble equilibration, the Berendsen algorithm49 was employed to regulate the temperature and
pressure of the system with coupling constants of 0.2 and 0.5 ps,
respectively. A 5 ns NVT equilibration run at 300 K and 1 bar was
then performed, following with 2 ns of equilibration in NPT conditions.
After successful equilibration of the system, the cATPase complex
was then simulated for 40 ns under constant pressure and temperature
conditions. Temperature was regulated using the velocity-rescaling
algorithm,50 with a coupling constant (τ)
of 0.1. All protein covalent bonds were frozen with the LINCS method,51 while SETTLE52 was
used for water molecules. Electrostatic interactions were calculated
with the particle mesh Ewald method,53 with
a 1.4 nm cutoff for direct space sums, a 0.12 nm FFT grid spacing
and a four-order interpolation polynomial for the reciprocal space
sums. van der Waals interactions were measured using a 1.4 nm cutoff.
The neighbor list for noncovalent interactions were updated every
five integration steps.

Modeling of the Peripheral Stalk
We performed homology
modeling of the peripheral stalks using the MODELLER package.54 We obtained a reliable homology model (sequence
identity >25%) using as templates the Thermus thermophilus H-type (PDB ID 3V6I) and bovine mitochondrial (PDB ID 2CLY) ATPases. To compensate for the lack
of lower part of stalks linking the core with the transmembrane ring,
we modeled in the helices using as guide the distance estimated from
the missing residues. Homology models for of ε, δ, and
γ subunits were also utilized as previously described.12

Modeling Scripts, Data, and Results
Our integrative
method was implemented in the open source IMP software package (http://integrativemodeling.org). The input data files, modeling scripts, and output models for
the tryptophan synthase and cATPase complex are available at https://github.com/apolitis/covalent_labelling_MS. This will allow keen scientists to use our data and/or integrate
with their own results for protein assembly modeling.

Results
and Discussion
Integrating Covalent Labeling into Computational
Modeling
We assessed the predictive power of our integrative
method for
three-dimensional protein modeling based on structural MS restraints
on four protein complexes previously characterized by X-ray crystallography:
the 143 kDa tryptophan synthase from Salmonella typhimurium (PDB ID 1WBJ),55 the α4β4 CPS (PDB ID 1BXR, ∼640 kDa), the double-heterohexameric ring RvB1/2 (PDB ID 4WVY; 621 kDa) (Figure S1) and the hexameric α3β3-head of cATPase from Spinacia oleracea (PDB ID 1FX0; ∼328 kDa).56 Covalent labeling
using DEPC, cross-linking with BS3 (Figure S-2) and native MS (Figure S-3) allowed us
to label serine, threonine, tyrosine, and histidine residues on the
surface of the complex, map cross-linked lysines and define stable
subcomplexes, respectively. Overall, we identified inter- and intrasubunit
cross-links (Tables S1–S3), up to
151 labeled residues (Tables S4, S5, and S7) and several (sub)complexes for tryptophan synthase, CPS and RvB1/2,
respectively (Figure 2A, 3A and B, and S4). For the cATPase hexameric head we used previously published cross-linking
results and native mass spectrometry12 and
in this study identified 58 solvent-exposed residues (Table S7). With the complementary MS-based data
in hand, we applied a computational workflow by first encoding our
data into modeling restraints (Figure 1A) and then using a scoring function to guide generation
of structural models (Figures 1B and S5 and Experimental
Section).

the frequency of the DEPC total labeled residues and the number of

The covalent labeling experiments enabled solvent accessible
surface
area (SASA) restraints. A SASA restraint is considered to be satisfied
if, for each experimentally labeled residue, the theoretically predicted
SASA is greater than 25% (Figure S6 and Experimental Section). We plotted the fraction of
satisfied residues on the corresponding crystal structure as a function
of the percentage of SASA providing justification for its use as a
lower bound restraint for modeling (Figure S6). The cutoff is defined as the highest SASA score that gives <10%
false positives while the true positives remain over 80% of the total
models. The cross-linking experiments allowed upper bound distance
restraints (<35 Å).39 This distance
breaks down into 11.4 Å for the linker (BS3), approximately 13
Å for the two lysine side chains and an additional tolerance
of 10 Å accounting for flexibility due to protein’s motion.
The resulting models from application of these restraints were considered
to match the data and added to the ensemble that is passed on to the
next stage for additional analysis. Clustering analysis36,44 revealed an ensemble of models with close similarity to the reference
crystal structure (r.m.s.d. ranging from 9 to 15 Å) (Figures 2 and 3C and D). Finally, a representative structure from the ensemble
was used as a starting model for explicit solvent MD simulations (Figure 1C).

Evaluation
of the modeling approach
Having established
the validity of using SASA restraints for modeling, we examined the
ability of our approach to predict high-resolution models using different
levels of theoretically labeled residues ranging from 25% to 100%.
Complete theoretical labeling information was extracted from the corresponding
crystal structure by assuming as labeled those serines, threonines,
tyrosines and histidines with theoretical SASA larger than 25%. The
residues with SASA less than 25% were considered buried and therefore
were not processed further. A model is defined “good”
when it exhibits high structural similarity to the reference crystal
structure as calculated by Cα atoms (r.m.s.d. < 12 Å).39 We estimated ∼90% positive predictive
value (PPV) within the top-scoring models when all theoretical information
was used and a difference of less than 10% PPV when the experimental
available data were used (Figure 2C).

To investigate the merit of modeling restraints
in predicting the correct structure of the three training complexes
(tryptophan synthase, CPS and RvB1/2), we determined receiver-operating
characteristic (ROC) plots for the MS techniques employed (Figures 2D and S7). This enabled us to test the ability of our
method in generating correct model structures on systems with diverse
topological features that include symmetry, ring-like geometries and
heteromeric subunits. The area under each curve was determined as
a measure of the information content of each restraint, where 0.5
indicates that correct and incorrect structures cannot be discriminated.44,57 The ROC plots of all three complexes studied here show that inclusion
of solvent accessibility restraints from covalent labeling markedly
increased (∼8–11%) the accuracy of structural prediction
(Figures 2D and S7). Increasing the accuracy of the predictions
by approximately 10% is an important improvement of the method particularly
when building models of multiprotein systems requires a large number
of models. For instance, if 10 000 models are generated, a
10% higher accuracy means that the structural prediction leads to
1000 less false positive and false negative models and therefore allows
an increased number of “good models” within the top-scoring
model structures. This is particularly important for assembling multicomponent
systems in a stepwise manner where degeneracy can significantly hinder
the accuracy of the resulting predictions.

Concentration Dependence
of DEPC Labeling
To assess
the effect of concentration on the labeling efficiency, we covalently
labeled solvent accessible residues on the three training complexes
using a range of labeling concentrations (8.75–70 μM)
(Figures 2E, 3E and F, and S8). Using
DEPC we targeted histidine, threonine, tyrosine and serine residues,
covering ∼15–20% of the complex sequence. We plotted
the number of experimentally labeled residues over the range of experimental
concentrations revealing a significant increase of the labeled residues
(10–30%) at higher concentrations (Figures 2E, 3E and F, and S8). A similar trend was found by counting the
total number of spectra measured at each concentration used for the
experiments (Figures 2E and 3E and F). We overall estimated a 5–10%
of the total residues uniquely identified in the two lower concentrations.
For modeling purposes we accounted for all labeled residues appearing
in at least in one concentration.

To study the accuracy and
precision of SASA restraint from covalent labeling followed by MS,
we projected the labeled serines, threonines, tyrosines and histidines
on the crystal structures of tryptophan synthase and the cATPase head
and examined their SASA (Figure 4). We revealed high accuracy (>85%) and precision
(>80%),
confirming the lower bound SASA as a confident restraint for modeling
in all benchmark complexes examined in the study.

Figure 4 Benchmark analysis of
SASA restraint derived from covalent labeling
MS experiments. We assessed (A) the sensitivity, specificity, and
accuracy and (B) the negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive
value (PPV), and false discovery rate (FDR) using SASA as a restraint
through the existing crystal structures of tryptophan synthase, CPS
and RVB1/B2 and cATPase (F1) as references models. SASA
area for all residues in the above structures were calculated and
compared to the identified labeled sites from covalent labeling MS.
A positive or correctly labeled residue is defined as a residue with
SASA more than 0.25. False positives or incorrectly labeled residues
are identified with calculated SASA below 0.25. Nonexperimentally
labeled residues with calculated SASA below 0.25 in the corresponding
structure represent true negatives, while false negatives have SASA

Solvent Accessibility and Modeling of cATPase
Next,
we assembled a model of the intact cATPase from Spinacia oleracea. The cATPase generates ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate using
an electrochemical proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane.56 Its stoichiometry is α3 β3 γδε–I–II–III14–IV;12 however, structural
information is limited to crystal structures of the soluble catalytic
head (α3 β3)56 and the III14 transmembrane ring.58 Little is known about the structural dynamics
of the individual subunits within the assembly. From studies on other
ATP synthases, we expect enhanced dynamics for the peripheral stalk,
a stator that links soluble and membrane domains and counteracts the
torque from “wobbling” of the soluble head during motor
rotation59 of the γ-subunit.60

We covalently labeled solvent accessible
residues on the surface of cATPase (Figure 5A and B). Different concentrations of DEPC
(8.75–70 μM), yielded 75 labeled residues (Table S7) in all protein subunits except ring
subunit III. The lack of labeled residues in the membrane ring subunit
is attributed to the protective layer of the detergent micelle. However,
we identified one labeling site on membrane subunit IV (Tyr 160).

are shown in red. (B) Covalent labeling analysis reveals solvent accessible
residues (gray space fillings) on the surface of the intact enzyme
(left and middle panel. Complementary structural information was obtained
from chemical cross-linking (right panel).

We used cross-links and dissociation pathways from native
MS reported
previously12 providing 11 subcomplexes
and a connectivity map (Figures S9 and S10).36 Covalent labeling
data were encoded into modeling restraints and together with distance
restraints from cross-linking, enabled us to map the inter-residue
proximities and SASA of the cATPase (Figure 5B). By employing our restraint-based modeling
approach, we brought together complementary restraints (Experimental Section) allowing us to assemble a structural
model of the cATPase (Figure 5B). As input we used the crystal structure of α3β3 and ring III14 subcomplexes
and homology models of subunits I, II, δ, γ, and ε
(Experimental Section). We were unable to
position subunit IV as only one residue was labeled and no cross-links
or subcomplexes were observed. However, we unambiguously defined the
orientation and proximities of the other subunits showing a slight
tilting (∼4°) of the central axis of the catalytic head
with respect to the axis of the membrane ring,59 consistent with crystal structures of mitochondrial ATPase61−64 and a model of the V-type ATPase (Figure S11).59,38,65

MD Simulations
Reveal Flexibility of cATPase
We used
the assembled model of cATPase as a starting structure for explicit
solvent MD simulations allowing us to examine the architecture and
dynamics of the enzyme. Similar to other ATPases, the cATPase γ
stalk subunit consists of a globular domain interacting with the α/β-head
and δ subunits. Their extended α helices link the F1 (head) and FO (transmembrane) domains. To allow
for movements of the rotor during the catalytic cycle, the peripheral
stalk must exhibit conformational flexibility. We therefore performed
simulations for the F1 domain (α3β3γδε-I II) (Figure S12 and Experimental Section). Consistent with
other ATPases59,65 we revealed significant flexibility
of subunits I, II, γ and δ as calculated by the r.m.s.d.
and r.m.s.f. (Figures 6A and B and S13). We projected the r.m.s.f
profiles on the surface of the cATPase visualizing dynamic regions
in the assembly. Particularly flexible regions were found within the
peripheral stalk and γ subunits (Figure 6B). In line with a recent study66 these regions are connected through a rigid
section, which may allow the stalk and the γ subunit to retain
their rigidity whereas accommodating the wobbling motion from rotary
catalysis. The γ subunit contains an additional loop compared
with other ATPases, which is responsible for its deactivation in the
absence of light.60 Interestingly, the
fluctuation of the γ subunit predicted by our method includes
the ∼40 amino acid long loop segment (residues 197–240).
It is interesting to speculate that the flexibility of this loop may
be related to its role in activation/deactivation of the enzyme suggesting
conformational changes during transition from one state to another.

Figure 6 Explicit
solvent MD simulations of cATPase (A) Plot of the residue
r.m.s.f. within each subunit over time reveals regions of enhanced
flexibility (B) Mapping the conformational fluctuation predicted on
the surface of cATPase. (C, D) Principal component analysis revealed
the local dynamics and directionality of motion within the peripheral
stalk subunits. The scatterplot colored with a gradient from green
to red indicates “start” and “end” of
the simulations, respectively.

To reduce the high dimensionality of the MD trajectories
and to
identify the dominant molecular motions of the peripheral stalks,
we performed principal component analysis (PCA). We showed that both
peripheral stalks undergo a “bending” motion with particular
flexible regions located at the initial and terminal ends of the stalks
(Figure 6C). The flexibility
of stalks is likely to be an intrinsic property enabling them to adjust
during the catalytic rotation of the molecular motor. This is consistent
with the twisting motion of the catalytic head of an A-ATPase proposed
previously59 and may be related to the
intermediate states of rotary ATPases during ATP synthesis.67,68

Conclusions
We presented here a strategy for interrogating
the structure and
dynamics of multiprotein assemblies. These assemblies are difficult
to study by traditional tools, which limits our knowledge of their
function. In our strategy, we incorporated modeling restraints derived
from covalent labeling MS in the form of SASA. We integrated, using
a scoring function, the SASA restraint with the connectivity and distance
restraints from native and chemical cross-linking MS, respectively.

We assessed the predictive power of the method by reconstructing
the 3D assembly structure of tryptophan synthase, CPS and RvB1/2 with
high accuracy and precision. The integration of a novel combination
of MS-based methods markedly increased the predictability of the method
as shown by ROC plots and enabled us to suggest a confident model
of cATPase, a particularly challenging target in structural biology.
We observed a ∼10% increase in the overall predictability of
the integrative methodology when covalent labeling was added to native
and cross-linking MS. Such an increase may have a significant effect
in differentiating between closely related states and in cases where
ambiguous or incomplete data sets exist. In principle, our workflow
allows the incorporation of every labeling strategy and we expect
that the application of complementary techniques targeting different
amino acid side chains will improve the predictability even further.
Such an increase in predictability can lead to high confident models
of multiprotein complexes and is primarily important for those systems
where limited information are attained by other biophysical methods,
such as the cATPase.

We provided an additional dimension by
subjecting the cATPase model
structure to solution phase simulations, allowing us to assign flexible
regions within the complex. Performing such simulations were possible
by the assembly of a confident model of cATPase from our restraint-based
strategy, thus demonstrating how static structural predictions and
dynamic simulations can be integrated for understanding complex biological
systems. Even though the main strength of our strategy is its ability
to simultaneously incorporate various labeling methods, it becomes
more powerful when combined with high-resolution information on the
individual assembly subunits.69 We envision
that the combination of labeling MS with accurate modeling and simulations
may be used in future to study many other multiprotein complexes currently
eluding structure determination.
