Recent
progress in top-down proteomics has driven the demand for
chromatographic methods compatible with mass spectrometry (MS) that
can separate intact proteins. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography
(HILIC) has recently shown good potential for the characterization
of glycoforms of intact proteins. In the present study, we demonstrate
that HILIC can separate a wide range of proteins exhibiting orthogonal
selectivity with respect to reversed-phase LC (RPLC). However, the
application of HILIC to the analysis of low abundance proteins (e.g.,
in proteomics analysis) is hampered by low volume loadability, hindering
down-scaling of the method to column diameters below 2.1 mm. Moreover,
HILIC-MS sensitivity is decreased due to ion suppression from the
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) often used as the ion-pair agent to improve
the selectivity and efficiency in the analysis of glycoproteins. Here,
we introduce a capillary-based HILIC-MS method that overcomes these
problems. Our method uses RPLC trap-columns to load and inject the
sample, circumventing issues of protein solubility and volume loadability
in capillary columns (200 μm ID). The low flow rates and use
of a dopant gas in the electrospray interface improve protein-ionization
efficiencies and reduce suppression by TFA. Overall, this allows the
separation and detection of small protein quantities (down to 5 ng
injected on column) as indicated by the analysis of a mixture of model
proteins. The potential of the new capillary HILIC-MS is demonstrated
by the analysis of a complex cell lysate.

==== Body
Proteins
are large and complex
macromolecules that play a critical role in many biological processes.
Their action is often mediated by variable modifications at the genetic,
transcriptional, or post-translational level. State-of-the-art proteomics,
using a combination of fractionation, digestion, liquid chromatography
(LC), and mass spectrometry (MS), has enabled the identification of
a large number of protein cellular components. However, current bottom-up
approaches reveal limited information on the distribution of proteins
in proteoforms.1 The identification of
proteoforms is essential to characterize protein activities, their
relationships, and ultimately the cell status.2−5 Therefore, the need to realize
isoform-specific analysis has led to the development of top-down proteomics
(TDP) analytical methods where proteins are analyzed in their intact
form, preserving their proteoform distribution.

Recent developments
in the field of MS have delivered benchtop
time-of-flight (ToF) and orbitrap instruments providing high resolution,
mass accuracy, and sensitivity. These include fragmentation technologies
such as electron-transfer dissociation (ETD)6,7 and
ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD),8 allowing
in-depth analysis of intact proteins.9,10 The hyphenation
of MS methods with nano reversed-phase LC (RPLC) has enabled detailed
study of proteoform distributions11 of
purified proteins as well as complex cell lysates.12 These intact protein analysis workflows rely on front-end
fractionation in order to reduce the sample complexity before MS analysis.
When analyzing highly modified proteins (such as histones) or the
proteome of a complex organism, RPLC-based methods may not be sufficiently
selective. Alternative MS-compatible LC techniques for protein analysis
have been developed, including size-exclusion,13 ion-exchange,14 hydrophilic
interaction (HILIC),11 and hydrophobic
interaction chromatography.15 These techniques
separate the sample components based on different analyte characteristics
(size, charge, hydrophilicity, and hydrophobicity, respectively).
Therefore, coupling these techniques in online or offline two-dimensional
LC workflows has increased the depth of LC-MS analysis of complex
protein samples.16−18

The use of HILIC for separating intact proteins
has recently gained
more attention. Different types of column chemistries (and hence selectivities)
have been successfully applied to the separation of proteins and proteoforms.
The two main classes of stationary phases typically used are weak
ion-exchange19 and neutral (polyhydroxylated20 or amide functionalized21) materials. To date, HILIC-MS has been applied to the study of proteins
such as histones,19 membrane proteins,22 intact23 and IdeS-digested24 monoclonal antibodies, biopharmaceuticals25 and neoglycoproteins.26 For these proteins, HILIC resolved proteoforms (e.g., resulting
from glycosylation or acetylation) would coelute in RPLC.

The
application of HILIC-MS for analysis of low abundant proteins
is currently limited by two main issues: protein-ionization suppression
by mobile-phase additives required for protein elution and solvent
compatibility problems related to sample and eluent. Weak-cation-exchange
HILIC (WCX-HILIC) methods are used to separate acetylated and methylated
variants of basic proteins (e.g., histones) using acetonitrile-rich
mobile phases with gradients from low to high concentration of acid/buffers
in water. Volatile buffers allow the coupling of these methods to
MS;11,27 however, their high concentration still
causes protein ion suppression.

In HILIC employing neutral stationary
phases, protein retention
is primarily based on hydrophilic interactions, under conditions that
diminish ion-exchange contributions, and, as such, do not require
high buffer concentrations. A gradient of acetonitrile to water is
used in combination with mobile-phase additives to decrease the pH
of the eluent and allow ion-pair formation with basic protein residues.
As a result, ionic interactions of the protein with the stationary
phase are minimized, leaving hydrophilic partitioning and/or hydrogen
bonding the driving forces of retention. Additionally, ion-pair agents.
such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), give rise to protein solvating
effects that enhance the chromatographic performance in terms of separation
selectivity, resolution, and peak shape.24,26,28 Nevertheless, when compared to weaker acids
such as formic and acetic acid, TFA causes ionization suppression
in electrospray ionization (ESI) MS, impairing protein detection.29,30

The other restriction that typically applies to HILIC is the
composition
of the injection solvent. HILIC separations, especially when using
neutral materials, are sensitive to the composition of the injection
plug. Depending on the volume loaded, injecting samples in solvents
comprising a high percentage of water may cause peak distortion31 and sample breakthrough (part of the compounds
injected leaves the column unretained).32 Thus, in HILIC, it is preferred to use sample diluents with an organic
solvent percentage similar to that of the initial mobile-phase composition.
However, many proteins have limited solubility and/or stability in
solvents of high organic content.

Here we describe a new HILIC-MS
approach aimed at minimizing issues
connected with both ionization suppression by TFA and analyte breakthrough
upon injection of aqueous protein samples. First, we show that HILIC
can separate a wide range of proteins, providing a selectivity orthogonal
to RPLC, however, allowing only limited injection volumes. In order
to circumvent this problem, we studied the use of online RPLC trap-columns
to load and inject protein samples on a capillary HILIC column packed
with amide functionalized silica. We investigated the advantage of
low flow rates and the use of a dopant gas to achieve favorable protein-ionization
efficiencies in the presence of TFA. Finally, we evaluated the applicability
of the capillary HILIC-MS method for the analysis of complex protein
mixtures.

Experimental Section
Chemicals and Sample Preparation
Water was obtained
from a direct-QTM Millipore system Millipore (Millipore, Billerica,
MA, U.S.A.). MS grade acetonitrile (ACN) and TFA were purchased from
Biosolve B.V. (Valkenswaard, The Netherlands). Escherichia
coli lyophilized protein lysate was purchased from Bio-Rad
(Veenendaal, The Netherlands). Ubiquitin (human >95%), ribonuclease
A (bovine pancreas Type X-A, ≥90%), ribonuclease B (bovine
pancreas, ≥80%), myoglobin (equine heart >90%), lysozyme
(chicken
egg white, >90%), carbonic anhydrase (bovine erythrocytes, ≥95%),
cytochrome c (equine heart, >95%), transferrin (human, >98%),
trypsinogen
(bovine pancreas, lyophilized powder) as well as other reagents were
acquired from Sigma–Aldrich (Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands).

Standard proteins were used as received without additional purification
and were solubilized in Milli-Q grade water at 2 mg/mL. The injection
volume on analytical scale columns was 2 μL of the protein standard.
For capillary LC-MS experiments, the sample was diluted to 0.2 mg/mL,
and the injection volume was 1.0 μL. The lyophilized lysate
of E. coli was diluted to a final concentration of 2.5 mg/mL, and
5.0 μL was injected.

HPLC
Analytical LC separations of
intact proteins were
performed on an Agilent HPLC 1290 Infinity II system (Waldbronn, Germany),
equipped with a quaternary pump, autosampler, column thermostated
compartment, and multiple wavelength detector. The HILIC column used
was an Agilent AdvanceBio glycan mapping 300 Å, 1.8 μm
(150 × 2.1 mm ID), which has an amide-based coating. The RPLC
C8 column was an Agilent RRHD 300 Å, 1.8 μm (50 ×
2.1 mm ID).

Capillary LC separations were done on an UltiMate
RSLCnano system (ThermoFisher Scientific, Breda, The Netherlands)
equipped with an autosampler (20 μL loop), thermocontrolled
column compartment with six ports, two-position valve, nano-HPLC and
loading pump system (NCS-3500RS), and UV/vis detector (VWD-3400RS).
The capillary HILIC column was packed in our laboratories using the
same stationary phase as the analytical column. A slurry was made
with MeOH (100 mg/mL), and a 200 μm ID capillary column was
packed using a steel-based union and frits from VICI-Valco. As a trap-column,
a 5 mm × 300 μm ID C4, 5 μm, 300 Å (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) was used. The outlet of the column was connected to the
CaptiveSpray source using a 750 mm long, 20 μm ID capillary.

The sample loop in the injection loop was loaded on the trap-column
at 15 μL/min using the loading pump (see Figure 3) for 3 min with a mobile phase of 2% ACN
in water with 0.1% TFA. HILIC mobile-phases for both analytical and
capillary HPLC separation were composed of solvent A (98% ACN, 2%
water, 0.1% TFA) and solvent B (10% 2-propanol, 2% ACN, 0.1% TFA).
The gradient programs are described in the figure captions. In order
to prevent carryover after the separation gradient, fast linear gradients
were programmed going from 90 to 10% B in 1 min, followed by three
cycles from 10 to 90% B in 1 min, and 90 to 10% B in 1 min, and final
column equilibration at 10% B for 10 min prior to sample injection.

MS
Capillary HILIC was coupled to a Bruker Maxis HD
instrument (Bremen, Germany) using CaptiveSpray ESI. The mass spectrometer
was operated in positive-ion mode with an electrospray voltage of
1.3 kV. The CaptiveSpray nanobooster pressure was set at 0.4 bar (ACN
+ 1% propionic acid) and dry gas at 3 L/min of nitrogen at 220 °C.
The quadrupole ion and collision cell energy were 4 and 8 eV, respectively.
The collision cell RF was 2000 Vpp. The
in-source CID (isCID) was set to 30 eV. The funnel RF was 400 Vpp, and the multipole RF was 800 Vpp. The transfer and prepulse storage times were set at
150.0 and 20.0 μs, respectively. The monitored mass range was
400–4000 m/z. The MS and
MS/MS (CID) acquisition rates were set to 1 Hz, the autoMSn cycle
time was 3 s, the MS/MS charge-state preference was 2–12, exclusion
was after 1 spectrum, the exclusion time was 60 s, and charge state
= 1 was ignored.

Data analysis was done using Compass data analysis
(4.3) from Bruker using the Maximum Entropy deconvolution algorithm.
Extracted-ion chromatograms were obtained with an extraction window
of ±0.5 m/z. ProMex and LcMsSpectator
(https://github.com/PNNL-Comp-Mass-Spec/Informed-Proteomics)33 were used for intact mass deconvolution and
visualization of the HILIC-MS runs reported in Figures 5 and 6.

mzML
data from the HILIC analysis shown in Figure 6 was uploaded to the National Resource for
Translational and Developmental Proteomics (NRTDP, Northwestern University,
Evanston, IL, U.S.A.) TDPortal1.3 high-performance computing environment
for analysis of high-throughput top-down proteomics data (available
for academic collaborators at: http://nrtdp.northwestern.edu/tdportal-request/). The data was deconvoluted using the THRASH algorithm with the
cut off of a S/N of 20, searched against the E. coli database. The
identified proteins were filtered at 1% of false discovery rate.

Results and Discussion
HILIC of Intact Proteins on Amide Stationary
Phases and Comparison
to RPLC
In order to study the selectivity of the amide functionalized
silica material, 14 proteins (Table 1) were selected covering a wide range of chemophysical
properties, such as molecular weight (Mw, 8.5–660 kDa), theoretical isoelectric point (pI, 5.2–9.6)
and aliphatic index (46–100). Most of these proteins carry
post-translational modifications (PTMs), in particular, ribonuclease
B, α-acidic glycoprotein (AGP), transferrin, fetuin, ovalbumin,
and thyroglobulin, which are glycosylated. Each protein standard was
injected from a water solution to the analytical HILIC column, and
a gradient of ACN/water containing 0.1% TFA was applied (see Figure 1A). With respect
to previous reports, here we used a small percentage of isopropanol
in the highly aqueous solvent both to reduce the solvent elution strength
and to prevent carry over between runs (further details are described
in the Experimental Section). Interestingly,
all the test proteins are retained on HILIC, indicating that such
a method can be used to resolve mixtures of intact proteins. The retention
and selectivity of the HILIC separation is determined both by the
properties of the peptide backbone (e.g., resolution between ubiquitin,
myoglobin, cytochrome c, and lysozyme) and by the presence of glycoforms.
Glycoproteins are better retained with respect to their aglyco form
as indicated by the clear separation of the nonglycosylated ribonuclease
(RnA) from its glycosylated isoforms (i.e., RnB).

The RPLC analysis
was performed using a linear gradient from 5 to 60% A in 45 min. HILIC
analysis started with 10% B for 1 min followed by a linear increase
to 20% B in 1 min and then to 55% B in 90 min. Flow rate, temperature,

Each protein standard was also
analyzed by C8 RPLC using the same
mobile-phase solvents, but with a gradient from high water to high
organic solvent content (details in the Experimental
Section). As can be seen from Figure 1 and Table 1, the protein elution orders of RPLC and HILIC are
clearly different and do not appear to correlate to chemophysical
parameters, such as pI, aliphatic index, and GRAVY (see section S1 of the Supporting Information). The
elution order in HILIC is also not the opposite of RPLC, suggesting
that different polar and nonpolar domains of the protein are responsible
for the interaction with the stationary phases, and as such, the two
methods have orthogonal selectivity.35 Hence,
HILIC could be used as a prefractionation method to reduce sample
complexity (e.g., in top-down proteomics analysis of complex cell
lysates12) given its alternative selectivity
and high peak capacity (comparable to RPLC).

Injection Volume and Sample
Breakthrough
HILIC separations
are sensitive to the solvent composition of the injected sample, and
this is a constraint when developing methods for separating intact
proteins. Ideally, the solvent composition should be as close as possible
to the initial elution conditions. However, the solubility and stability
of many proteins in high percentages of ACN is low. In order to allow
proteins to be injected in water, small volumes of concentrated protein
solutions have been injected while starting the gradients at a high
percentage of ACN. In this way, peak distortion by the strong elution
strength of the sample diluent could be prevented.23,26,36 This approach has proven feasible for relatively
pure samples, such as biopharmaceuticals,23,24 but may not be (directly) applicable to more diluted and complex
samples containing various proteins at low concentrations.

In
order to further investigate the limitations of the direct analysis
of highly aqueous samples with HILIC, we studied the effect of the
injection volume on the chromatographic performance of four proteins
(Figure 2). Increasing
sample volumes (2–20 μL) were injected while keeping
the protein mass injected constant. For the retained proteins, peak
shapes remained fairly constant, showing no deformation (Figure 2S). However, injection volumes above
10 μL showed a drastic decrease of peak area for the retained
protein peaks, while the peak eluting with the column void volume
substantially increased.

Figure 2 Area of the retained peak obtained during HILIC
of (a) RNase A
and B1 (first eluting glycoform), (b) carbonic anhydrase, and (c)
transferrin using increasing injection volumes (2–20 μL).
Protein concentrations are 0.2 mg/mL (2 μL), 0.05 mg/mL (8 μL),
0.04 mg/mL (10 μL), 0.026 mg/mL (15 μL), 0.020 mg/mL (20
μL). The error bars indicate the standard deviation from triplicate
injections. The chromatograms of the measurements as well as the gradient
details are reported in Figure S2.

Hence, upon the applied conditions,
injection of volumes higher
than 10 μL (corresponding to about 3% of the column volume)
have a significant amount of the protein injected not retained on
the column but did elute with the solvent front. This phenomenon is
known as “breakthrough”32 and happens because the injection solvent (water) is a strong eluent
in HILIC. Small injection volumes allow the injection solvent to be
efficiently mixed with the ACN-rich mobile phase in the column at
the start of the gradient. However, with injection volumes above 3–5%
of the column volume, the mixing becomes incomplete. As a result,
part of the protein injected remains in the injected solvent eluting
at the column dead time, while part of it is retained on the column.
We also tested mobile phases containing 0.05% TFA instead of 0.1%
TFA and observed an earlier onset of breakthrough (starting from 4
μL, data not shown), demonstrating the importance of the concentration
of the ion-pairing agent in solvating the proteins in mobile phases
rich in ACN.

Capillary HILIC Separation Using an RPLC
Trap-Column
Injecting small volumes (0.5–1 μL)
of concentrated samples
(e.g., 1–2 mg/mL) may be a viable option when analyzing biotechnological
protein products available in relatively large amounts. In our research,
we aimed to extend the application of HILIC methods to study intact
proteins in biological samples (e.g., proteomics purposes). These
applications typically require capillary or nano-HPLC in order to
profit from sensitive ESI-MS detection at low flow rates. When downscaling
the HILIC method to a capillary format using a column of 200 mm length
and 200 μm ID, the maximum allowed volume of injection for aqueous
samples without causing breakthrough would be about 120–200
nL. Such a volume is difficult to inject reliably with standard injectors,
and relatively high concentrations would be needed to inject appreciable
amounts of protein (e.g., to inject 100 ng on column, one would need
a 0.5 mg/mL solution).

Trap-columns, having chemistry similar
to that of the stationary phase used (but generally less retentive),
allow one to preconcentrate analytes from relatively large sample
volumes of weak elution solvents and subsequently inject them onto
the separation column in a much smaller volume.37 However, trap-columns are not a solution to overcome the
limited volume loadability of HILIC, since these would only be compatible
with samples dissolved in high percentages of organic solvent. For
this reason, we used RPLC trap-columns (5 × 0.3 mm ID packed
with C4, 300 Å material) to load relatively large volumes (up
to 20 μL) of aqueous samples and injected the concentrated proteins
in about 220 nL. Elution was achieved by simply backflushing the trap-column
using the HILIC starting solvent, which is high in ACN (i.e., a strong
eluent for RPLC). The small sample plug, once it leaves the trap,
is mixed with the HILIC mobile-phase and focused on the capillary
HILIC column and then separated using a gradient. A schematic of the
system is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Schematic representation
of the capillary HILIC-MS setup with online
trap column and CaptiveSpray interface.

A small adjustment of the gradient conditions, in which the
capillary
column is held for 1 min at 10% solvent B, allowed injection of the
entire trap-column volume (about 220 nL) on the capillary HILIC column
without observing significant breakthrough. This configuration allowed
us to load aqueous sample volumes of up to 20 μL in the trap-column
(i.e., about 700% of the column volume) without significant sample
losses. This was demonstrated by the linear correlation between the
mass loaded on the trap-column and protein peak areas obtained (section S3 of the Supporting Information).

Capillary HILIC-MS of Proteins: Optimization of ESI Conditions
Capillary scale separations help reduce solvent and sample consumption
and benefit from more favorable ESI conditions. Still, a significant
bottleneck in the application of HILIC separations remains the presence
of relatively high concentrations of TFA in the mobile phase (0.1%
v/v), resulting in protein-ionization suppression and formation of
gas-phase TFA–protein adducts. HILIC methods having formic
acid as eluent additive are not a viable option, as the protein separation
efficiency of HILIC methods is significantly reduced, in particular
with respect to glycoforms.24 Dissociation
of formed TFA–protein adducts in some instances can be achieved
using a high in-source collision energy (isCID; often over 100 eV28) during MS analysis. However, a potential drawback
of a high isCID is that proteins (in particular, proteins below 30
kDa) may be fragmented in the source, impairing their intact analysis.

To overcome this issue, we studied the use of a CaptiveSpray38,39 source to reduce issues with protein ionization due to TFA in capillary
HILIC-MS methods. This ionization source allows the introduction of
dopant-enriched nitrogen (DEN) gas in the ionization chamber, in order
to enhance ESI of analytes. Here we investigated the use of ACN and
ACN with 1% propionic acid (PA) as the DEN-gas in capillary HILIC-MS
for a mixture of cytochrome C and ribonuclease A and compared it with
analysis without DEN-gas (Figure 4).

each, 10 μL injection) using pure nitrogen (magenta), nitrogen

B in 1 min, from 20 to 50% B in 10 min, from 50 to 90% B in 2 min.

The use of DEN-gas significantly
enhances the ionization of the
HILIC separated proteins. The peak area obtained for cytochrome C
with ACN as the DEN-gas is up to 400-fold larger with respect to the
same analysis with nondoped nitrogen gas (Figure 4a). Moreover, Figure 4b shows a drastic shift in the charge-state
distribution observed for RNase A when ACN is used as DEN-gas. The
DEN-gas has a clear charging effect, counteracting the ionization
suppression effects of TFA and substantially improving the proteins’
ESI efficiency. Relatively mild isCID conditions (30 eV) were applied,
and therefore, TFA adducts still appeared in the mass spectrum (Figure 4b, middle trace).
Addition of PA to the ACN DEN-gas removed the TFA–protein adducts
and further increased protein signal intensity, shifting the protein
charge-distribution to higher charge states (Figure 4B, bottom trace).

Chen et al.39 reported the use of PA
vapors to counteract ion-suppression due to TFA using a ionization
source having a similar layout on a different mass spectrometer (Orbitrap
XL). Signal enhancement and declustering may be a result of the dissolution
of PA vapor in the ESI droplets. The lower vapor pressure of PA with
respect to TFA (0.32 vs 11 kPa at 20 °C) would facilitate the
formation of PA–protein adducts in the gas phase, complexes
that can be more easily dissociated with respect to the ones resulting
from TFA. Moreover, acidic vapors can improve the ionization efficiency
of analytes as described by Kharlamova40 and then by Li et al.41 Infusion experiments
of single proteins in 50/50 ACN/water with 0.1% TFA and pure PA as
DEN-gas helped increase the signal intensity but at the same time
introduced PA adducts and significantly shifted the protein charge-state
distribution toward higher charge states. The different outcome of
our result may be explained by the different design of the desolvation
source of the instruments, the gas pressure at which TOF and Orbitrap
systems operate, and different ESI settings. Therefore, in our experiments,
we opted to use a mixture of ACN and PA, which successfully tackled
this issue

Ultimately, capillary HILIC with an online RPLC trap-column
and
CaptiveSpray source using ACN with 1% PA as DEN-gas enabled us to
obtain clear mass spectra for protein masses down to 5 ng on the column
(∼400 fmol, 2 μL of a 2.5 ng/μL; more details available
in section S3 of the Supporting Information).

Capillary HILIC-MS of Protein Mixture and Cell Lysate
In
order to study the applicability of the developed capillary HILIC-MS
method for the assessment of protein samples, a mixture of eight standard
proteins of varying natures was analyzed (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Capillary HILIC-MS of
mixture of eight proteins and their protein
contaminants. (a) Total-ion chromatogram and (b–e) deconvoluted
mass spectra obtained for the peaks (area indicated) of (b) ubiquitin,
(c) myoglobin, (d) trypsinogen, and (e) transferrin. Figure 5b–d shows the isotope
clusters obtained for each protein, while Figure 5e reports the observed average masses of
the glycoforms of transferrin. Protein abbreviations as described
in Figure 1 except
for: asuperoxide dismutase and bcationic trypsin.
Flow rate, 3 μL/min; column temperature, 50 °C; 2 μL
injection of 0.05 μg/μL solution. Trap-column loaded for
3 min at 15 μL/min. Linear gradient from 10 to 20% B in 1 min,
from 20 to 50% B in 30 min, from 50 to 90% B in 2 min; isCID energy,
40 eV. The extracted-ion chromatograms, mass spectra, and measured
peak capacity are reported in section S4 of the Supporting Information.

Good-quality mass spectra were obtained for all of the proteins,
including carbonic anhydrase, which is particularly sensitive to fragmentation
when using high isCID energies42 (the MS
spectra are reported in section S4). Notably,
transferrin, which has a relatively high molecular weight (>70
kDa)
and often requires high isCID energy for ion desolvation, could be
detected effectively under the applied conditions. The average width-at-half-height
for the peaks in the extracted-ion chromatograms was about 0.2 min,
resulting in a satisfactory peak capacity of 43 for an effective gradient
window of about 15 min (results are summarized in Table S1).

The potential of the capillary HILIC-MS method
for proteomics purposes
was evaluated by the analysis of an E. coli lysate. Figure 6 shows the base-peak chromatogram and feature map (deconvoluted MS
spectra vs time) obtained with capillary HILIC-MS after loading about
10 μg of lysate on column. The surfactant present in the sample
elutes as an intense peak at the beginning of the chromatogram (∼8
min) followed by the proteins.

Figure 6 Capillary HILIC-MS of an E. coli lysate
(5 μL loaded of a
2.5 mg/mL solution in 2% ACN and 0.1% TFA). (top) Base-peak chromatogram
(900–3000 m/z); (bottom)
feature map showing deconvoluted MS spectra. The deconvolution algorithm
is based on isotopically resolved molecular features, and therefore,
potential features above 35 kDa are not identified. Mobile phases
as specified in the Experimental Section.
Loading at 10% B, multisegment linear gradient from 10–12%
B in 1 min, 12–30% in 30 min, 30–65% B in 6 min, 65–90%
B in 1 min, followed by 3 min at 90% B and several washing steps (total
analysis time of 60 min).

A large number of LC-MS protein features were detected in
the HILIC
MS run (representative mass spectra are reported in section S5 of the Supporting Information). Promex33 analysis of our data set revealed 885 distinct
deconvoluted masses from species having charge states between 5 and
30 and a likelihood ratio higher than 100. The likelihood is calculated
on the basis of ratio of abundance at a given charge state with respect
to total abundance and the similarity score of the aggregated isotopomer
envelope.33 Analysis of the MS/MS data
using TDportal identified 23 proteins at 1% FDR (the list is available
in the Supporting Information) with Mw below 15 kDa. The limited identifications are a consequence of not
fully optimized analysis conditions. Given the complexity of the sample,
coelution of proteins in one-dimensional LC is inevitable, and fractionation/multidimensional
separations should be employed.16,43,44 However, our results prove that HILIC can be used for high-resolution
separation of intact proteins as demonstrated by the peak capacity
of about 200 obtained from a 25 min elution window. This result suggests
that HILIC methods could be used for fractionation in top-down MS
experiments given the high resolution and the orthogonality with respect
to RPLC analysis.

Conclusions
The development of a
generally applicable approach to perform capillary
HILIC-mass spectrometry analysis of intact proteins is reported. The
restraints on protein solubility, volume loadability, and ionization
suppression met in analytical scale HILIC are overcome using an RPLC
trap-column (to concentrate the sample injection volumes) and a dopant
gas in the ESI.

The capillary HILIC-MS method can be used as
a high-resolution
approach to separate complex mixtures of proteins such as cell lysates
using wide mobile-phase gradients (e.g., from 10 to 40% water). Implementation
of this method adds selectivity options for multidimensional LC of
intact proteins and represents an alternative to RPLC-MS for the analysis
of proteins after affinity purification. The relatively small protein
quantities needed for analysis makes the method attractive for samples
comprising low concentrations of proteins. Further down-scaling of
the method to nanoliter flow rates should be possible, potentially
achieving an increase in sensitivity. This would require reducing
the dimensions of the RPLC trap-column (e.g., to 10 mm × 100
μm ID) and those of the HILIC column (e.g., to 300 mm ×
75 μm ID). However, at present, trap-columns of such dimensions
are not commercially available.
