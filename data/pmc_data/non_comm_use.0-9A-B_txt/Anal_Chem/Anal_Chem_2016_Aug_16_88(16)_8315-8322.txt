Cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS)
has become a powerful strategy
for defining protein–protein interactions and elucidating architectures
of large protein complexes. However, one of the inherent challenges
in MS analysis of cross-linked peptides is their unambiguous identification.
To facilitate this process, we have previously developed a series
of amine-reactive sulfoxide-containing MS-cleavable cross-linkers.
These MS-cleavable reagents have allowed us to establish a common
robust XL-MS workflow that enables fast and accurate identification
of cross-linked peptides using multistage tandem mass spectrometry
(MSn). Although amine-reactive reagents
targeting lysine residues have been successful, it remains difficult
to characterize protein interaction interfaces with little or no lysine
residues. To expand the coverage of protein interaction regions, we
present here the development of a new acidic residue-targeting sulfoxide-containing
MS-cleavable homobifunctional cross-linker, dihydrazide sulfoxide
(DHSO). We demonstrate that DHSO cross-linked peptides display the
same predictable and characteristic fragmentation pattern during collision
induced dissociation as amine-reactive sulfoxide-containing MS-cleavable
cross-linked peptides, thus permitting their simplified analysis and
unambiguous identification by MSn. Additionally,
we show that DHSO can provide complementary data to amine-reactive
reagents. Collectively, this work not only enlarges the range of the
application of XL-MS approaches but also further demonstrates the
robustness and applicability of sulfoxide-based MS-cleavability in
conjunction with various cross-linking chemistries.

==== Body
The majority
of proteins exert
their functions in the form of protein complexes. These macromolecular
assemblies and their protein–protein interactions play critical
roles in regulating integral biological processes. As a result, perturbations
of endogenous protein–protein interactions can result in deleterious
effects on cellular activities. Structural analyses of these complexes
by traditional biophysical structural techniques such as X-ray crystallography
and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are frequently utilized to elucidate
their topologies. Unfortunately, many large and heterogeneous complexes
are refractory to such methods, ushering the development of new hybrid
structural strategies. Cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) has
emerged as a powerful and popular approach for delineating the protein
interactions within large multisubunit protein complexes.1,2 Moreover, cross-linking can capture temporal protein interactions
by forming covalent bonds between proximal amino acid residues, effectively
freezing transient interactions and providing information on the identities
and spatial orientations of interacting proteins simultaneously. These
linkages are then utilized as distance constraints to facilitate three-dimensional
modeling of protein complexes by refining existing high-resolution
protein structures or complementing lower resolution biophysical structural
techniques (e.g., cryo-electron microscopy) in order to position individual
protein subunits or interacting regions.3−9

One of the major challenges in conventional XL-MS studies
is the
unambiguous identification of cross-linked peptides, due to difficulty
in interpreting convoluted tandem mass spectra resulting from the
fragmentation of covalently linked peptides. To this end, various
types of cleavable cross-linkers have been developed to facilitate
and simplify MS identification of cross-linked peptides, among which
MS-cleavable cross-linkers appear to be the most attractive option
due to their capability to improve MS identification of cross-linked
peptides.10−16 In recent years, we have developed a new class of MS-cleavable cross-linking
reagents containing sulfoxide group(s) within their spacer regions,
i.e., disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DSSO),14 dimethyl disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DMDSSO),15 azide-tagged acid-cleavable disuccinimidyl bissulfoxide (Azide-A-DSBSO)16 (Figure 1A–C). These MS-cleavable reagents contain symmetric
MS-labile C–S bonds (adjacent to the sulfoxide group) that
can be selectively and preferentially fragmented prior to peptide
backbone cleavage during collision induced dissociation (CID).14−16 Such fragmentation is robust and predictable, occurring independently
of cross-linking types, peptide charges, and sequences. Ultimately
this unique feature enables simplified and unambiguous identification
of cross-linked peptides by MSn analysis
and conventional database searching tools.14−16 Our newly developed
sulfoxide-containing, MS-cleavable cross-linkers have been successfully
applied not only to define protein–protein interactions and
elucidate structures of protein complexes in vitro(5,9,14,17) and in vivo(16) but also
to quantify structural dynamics of protein complexes.15,18

In current XL-MS studies, amine-reactive
reagents targeting lysine
residues are the most widely used compounds for successful elucidation
of protein structures. This is due to their effective and specific
cross-linking chemistry as well as frequent occurrence of lysine residues
in protein sequences, especially at surface-exposed regions of protein
structures. However, it remains challenging to characterize protein
interaction interfaces with little to no lysine residues. Therefore,
there is a necessity for the development of additional cross-linking
chemistries in order to increase the coverage of structural information
obtainable from XL-MS experiments, particularly in systems where protein
interacting regions are refractive to amine-specific cross-linking.
Although several types of cross-linkers targeting other amino acids
(e.g., sulfhydryl-reactive and nonspecific photoreactive) reagents
are commercially available, their applications in studying protein–protein
interactions thus far are very limited. For instance, sulfhydryl-reactive
cross-linking reagents with specific chemistries targeting cysteine
residues have not been widely adopted, most likely owing to the relatively
low occurrence of cysteine residues and their participation in forming
disulfide bonds in protein structures. In comparison, although photochemical
cross-linking reagents can improve the coverage of protein interaction
contacts by reacting with any amino acids nonspecifically,19 the resulting cross-linked products are often
unpredictable, making their unambiguous MS identification even more
difficult. In addition, nonspecific cross-linking has a higher chance
of introducing more nonspecific interactions. Therefore, a specific
cross-linking chemistry targeting other amino acid residues abundant
at protein interaction sites would be ideal for complementing lysine
targeting cross-linkers. While hydrophobic amino acid residues often
constitute the cores, charged hydrophilic residues such as lysine,
arginine, aspartic acid (Asp), and glutamic acid (Glu) often occupy
surface-exposed regions of protein complexes, making them ideal targets
for mapping protein interactions. According to a recent SwissProt
database release,20 aspartic and glutamic
acids comprise roughly 12.2% of all amino acid residues, compared
to the 5.8% of lysines. Therefore, acidic residues (i.e., aspartic
and glutamic acids) represent high potential targets for cross-linking
studies due to their abundance and prevalence at interaction interfaces.

A recent study by Leitner et al. has demonstrated the feasibility
of acidic residue-specific cross-linking chemistry to study protein
interactions using noncleavable homobifunctional dihydrazide cross-linkers
in conjunction with the coupling reagent 4-(4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-4-methylmorpholinium
chloride (DMTMM).21 This methodology is
an improvement on the acidic residue cross-linking chemistry involving
the coupling reagent 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl) carbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDC) that requires the cross-linking reaction to occur
at a pH of 5.5.22 In comparison, DMTMM
coupling with dihydrazide cross-linkers is compatible with proteins
at neutral pH (7.0–7.5) and therefore better suited for studying
the structures of proteins and protein complexes under physiological
conditions. However, this cross-linking strategy remains susceptible
to the challenges associated with traditional cross-linking reagents
in unambiguously identifying cross-linked peptides and their linkage
sites. Because of the increased prevalence of Asp and Glu in protein
sequences, the accurate and unambiguous identification of peptides
containing noncleavable dihydrazide cross-linked acidic residues would
be intrinsically more complicated than the identification of lysine
cross-linked peptides. To simplify MS analysis and facilitate the
identification of acidic residue cross-linked peptides, we have developed
a sulfoxide-containing MS-cleavable acidic residue-specific homobifunctional
cross-linking reagent, dihydrazide sulfoxide (DHSO, a.k.a. 3,3′-sulfinyldi(propanehydrazide)).
This reagent adopts the same MS-labile sulfoxide chemistry as our
previously developed amine-reactive MS-cleavable cross-linkers (i.e.,
DSSO, DMDSSO, and Azide-A-DSBSO), thus enabling robust and unambiguous
identification of cross-linked peptides via the same XL-MSn workflow.14−16 DHSO represents a novel class
and the first generation of acidic residue-targeting cross-linking
reagents with MS-cleavability. We expect that DHSO-based XL-MS strategies
will become an invaluable tool in providing a complementary subset
of cross-linking data toward a comprehensive structural elucidation
of protein complexes by XL-MS.

Experimental Procedures
Materials and Reagents
General chemicals were purchased
from Fisher Scientific or VWR International. Bovine serum albumin
(≥96% purity), myoglobin from equine heart (≥90% purity),
and DMTMM (≥96% purity) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Ac-SR8 peptide (Ac-SAKAYEHR, 98.22% purity) was custom ordered from
Biomatik (Wilmington, DE).

DHSO Cross-Linking of Synthetic Peptides
DHSO was synthesized
as described (Figure 1D and Supplemental Methods). Synthetic
peptide Ac-SR8 was dissolved in DMSO to 1 mM and cross-linked with
DHSO in a 1:1 molar ratio of peptide to cross-linker in the presence
of 1 equiv of diisopropylethylamine and DMTMM. The resulting samples
were diluted to 10 pmol/μL in 3% ACN/2% formic acid prior to
MSn analysis.

DHSO Cross-Linking of Equine
Myoglobin and Bovine Serum Albumin
A volume of 50 μL
of 50 μM BSA or 200 μM myoglobin
in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) was reacted with DHSO in molar ratios of 1:5,
1:10, 1:20, and 1:30. The cross-linking reaction was initiated by
adding equivalent concentrations of DHSO and DMTMM to protein solutions,
reacted for 1 h at room temperature.

Digestion of DHSO Cross-Linked
Proteins
Cross-linked
protein samples were subjected to either SDS-PAGE followed by in-gel
digestion or directly digested in solution prior to MS analysis23 (Supplemental Methods).

Liquid Chromatography–Multistage Tandem Mass Spectrometry
(LC–MSn) Analysis
DHSO
cross-linked peptides were analyzed by LC–MSn utilizing an Easy-nLC 1000 (Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA) coupled
online to an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, San
Jose, CA).14,15 LC–MSn data extraction and database searching for the identification
of DHSO cross-linked peptides were performed similarly as previously
described14 (see the Supplemental Methods).

Results and Discussion
Design
and Synthesis of a Novel Acidic Residue-Targeting Sulfoxide-Containing
MS-Cleavable Cross-Linker
In order to facilitate accurate
identification of acidic residue cross-linked peptides, we aimed to
develop a novel MS-cleavable cross-linking reagent specific to Asp
and Glu residues. This requires the incorporation of a functional
group with robust MS-inducible cleavage sites located in the spacer
region of the cross-linker. Previously, we successfully developed
a novel class of amine-reactive, sulfoxide-containing MS-cleavable
cross-linkers, i.e., DSSO,14 DMDSSO,15 and Azide-A-DSBSO16 (Figure 1A–C).
The C–S bonds adjacent to the sulfoxide group(s) in these reagents
have proven to be reliable labile bonds that fragment selectively
and preferentially prior to the breakage of the peptide backbone during
collision induced dissociation. Additionally, such fragmentation is
predictable and occurs independently of peptide charge and sequence.
These unique features facilitate the simplified analysis of sulfoxide-containing
cross-linked peptides and their unambiguous identification by MSn.14−16 Following the success of our
MS-cleavable, amine-reactive cross-linkers, we designed a novel acidic
residue-reactive, MS-cleavable homobifunctional dihydrazide cross-linker
incorporating a sulfoxide group in the spacer region, i.e., dihydrazide
sulfoxide (DHSO). DHSO is synthesized from DSSO with two additional
synthesis steps (Figure 1D). As shown, DHSO is composed of two hydrazide reactive groups and
two symmetrical C–S cleavable bonds flanking a central sulfoxide.
The spacer length of DHSO is 12.4 Å (calculated between the terminal
nitrogen atoms). In comparison to existing cross-linkers for XL-MS
studies,14−16,21 DHSO carries a
linker length well suited for defining interaction interfaces between
and within protein complexes.

CID Fragmentation Patterns
of DHSO Cross-Linked Peptides
A previous study has shown
that the reaction of hydrazide cross-linkers
with acidic residues first requires activation of the terminal carboxyl
groups of Asp (D) and Glu (E) side chains or protein C-termini.21 The coupling reagent DMTMM has been demonstrated
to be effective in activating carboxylic acid groups to form a reactive
intermediate that can be displaced by nucleophilic attack from hydrazides
under physiological pH21 (Figure S-1A). Therefore, in this work, we have adopted DMTMM
as the activating agent for DHSO cross-linking of acidic residues.
Similar to lysine-reactive cross-linkers, DHSO cross-linking would
result in the formation of three types of cross-linked peptides: dead-end
(type 0), intralink (type 1), and interlink (type 2) modified peptides,
among which interlinked peptides provide the most informative data
on the relative spatial orientation of cross-linked acidic residues.24 Since all of the MS-cleavable, homobifunctional
NHS esters we have previously developed display the same characteristic
fragmentation patterns in MS2 due to the cleavage of either
of the two symmetric CID-cleavable C–S bonds adjacent to the
sulfoxide functional group,14−16 we expect that DHSO cross-linked
peptides will behave similarly during MSn analysis even though their residue-targeting functional groups are
different.

To elaborate this process, Figure 1E and Figure S-1B,C illustrate the predicted MS2 fragmentation patterns of
DHSO interlinked, intralinked, and dead-end modified peptides, respectively.
For a DHSO interlinked peptide α-β, the cleavage of one
of the two symmetric C–S bonds would result in one of the two
predicted peptide fragment pairs (i.e., αA/βS or αS/βA). The resulting
α and β peptide fragments are modified by complementary
cross-linker remnant moieties, i.e., alkene (A) or sulfenic acid (S).
However, the sulfenic acid moiety can undergo dehydration to become
a more stable unsaturated thiol moiety (i.e., T) (Figure S-1D). This conversion has been commonly observed in
amine-reactive, sulfoxide-containing MS-cleavable cross-linked peptides,
thus leading to the detection of αA/βT and αT/βA pairs instead as the
four dominant MS2 fragment ions.14−16 Therefore,
these two MS2 fragment pairs (i.e., αA/βT and αT/βA)
are expected for a DHSO cross-linked heterodimer as well (Figure 1E), which can then
be subjected to MS3 analysis for unambiguous identification
of cross-linked peptide sequences and cross-linking sites. For a DHSO
intralinked peptide αintra in which proximal D or
E amino acid residues are cross-linked within the same peptide, one
peptide fragment (i.e., αA+T) is expected in MS2 analysis (Figure S-1B). In reality,
this particular ion would represent two populations of ion species
that have identical peptide sequences and m/z values but transposed DHSO remnant-modified acidic residues.
Lastly, a DHSO dead-end modified peptide αDN would
potentially fragment into two ion species during MS2 analysis.
Depending on the position of the cleaved C–S bond, αA or αT fragments would be observed, resulting
in a pair of daughter ions detected during MS2 (Figure S-1C). The distinct MS2 fragmentation
patterns of sulfoxide-containing MS-cleavable cross-linked peptides
result in predictable mass relationships between parent ions and their
respective fragments. These mass relationships are utilized as an
additional verification of cross-linked peptide identification at
the MS2 level. Along with mass fingerprinting by MS1 and peptide sequencing by MS3, three lines of
evidence can be obtained and integrated to accurately identify DHSO
cross-linked peptides using the identical MSn workflow that has been developed for the analysis of DSSO,
DMDSSO, and DSBSO cross-linked peptides.14−16

Characterization
of DHSO Cross-Linked Model Peptides by MSn Analysis
Despite the similarities
in spacer arm structure to DSSO, it is necessary to verify whether
DHSO cross-linked peptides indeed fragment as described above during
MSn analysis (Figure 1E). Initial characterization of DHSO was
performed on a synthetic peptide containing a single acidic residue,
Ac-SR8 (Ac-SAKAYEHR). Interlinked Ac-SR8 homodimer was detected as
quadruply charged (m/z 548.76234+) and quintuply charged (m/z 439.21175+) ion species, respectively. Since the two
peptide sequences of interlinked homodimer are the same, only one
pair of MS2 fragment ions (i.e., αA/αT) would be expected. Indeed, MS2 analysis of the
quadruply charged parent ion produced a pair of dominant fragment
ions αA/αT (m/z 536.272+/552.262+), demonstrating
effective physical separation of the two cross-linked peptides as
expected (Figure 2A).
Similarly, MS2 analysis of the quintuply charged parent
ion (m/z 439.21175+)
yielded a single pair of dominant fragment ions αA/αT (m/z 357.853+/552.262+) as well (Figure 2B), demonstrating the characteristic fragmentation
independent of peptide charges as expected. Subsequent MS3 analysis of the αA (m/z 536.272+) fragment ion (Figure 2C) resulted in a series of y and b ions that
unambiguously confirmed the peptide sequence as Ac-SAKAYEAHR in which the glutamic acid was modified with a DHSO alkene (A)
moiety. Similarly, MS3 analysis of the αT fragment (m/z 552.262+) determined its identity as Ac-SAKAYETHR, in which the
glutamic acid was modified with a DHSO unsaturated thiol (T) moiety
(Figure 2D). Therefore,
the cross-linked peptide was identified as [Ac-SAKAYE6HR]
interlinked to [Ac-SAKAYE6HR] through E6 in both peptides.
This result indicates that DHSO interlinked peptides indeed display
the same characteristic MSn fragmentation
as sulfoxide-containing lysine interlinked peptides and can be analyzed
using the same data analysis workflow as previously described.14−16

Characterization of DHSO Cross-Linked Model Proteins by MSn Analysis
To evaluate the capability
of DHSO for protein cross-linking in vitro, we used
equine myoglobin and bovine serum albumin (BSA) as our model proteins.
These two proteins contain above-average acidic residue content (16.3%
and 13.6%, respectively), making them well suited for evaluating DHSO
cross-linking. In addition, BSA was employed previously for acidic
residue cross-linking by noncleavable dihydrazides.21 To identify DHSO cross-linked peptides in myoglobin and
BSA, we have performed in-gel digestion of gel-separated DHSO cross-linked
proteins or in solution digestion of DHSO cross-linked proteins followed
by peptide SEC as illustrated (Figure S-2). The resulting peptides were subjected to LC–MSn analysis. Figure 3A displays the MS1 spectrum of an exemplary
interlinked peptide (α-β) (m/z 517.27035+) identified from myoglobin. Its
MS2 analysis resulted in the detection of two peptide fragment
pairs, i.e., αA/βT (m/z 429.742+/569.633+) and
αT/βA (m/z 445.722+/559.643+) (Figure 3B), characteristic for DHSO
interlinked heterodimers. MS3 analysis of αA (m/z 429.742+) (Figure 3C) determined its
sequence as ASEADLKK, in which the glutamic acid residue
at the third position from the N-terminus was modified with an alkene
moiety. MS3 analysis of βT (m/z 569.633+) identified its sequence
as VEADTIAGHGQEVLIR, with the aspartic acid residue
at the fourth position from the N-terminus carrying an unsaturated
thiol moiety (Figure 3D). Collectively, the interlinked peptide was unambiguously identified
as [18VEADTIAGHGQEVLIR32 cross-linked
to 58ASEADLKK64], describing an interlink
formed between D21 and E60 of equine myoglobin.

peptide α-β (m/z 517.27035+). (B) MS2 spectrum of the interlinked peptide

ions: (C) αA (m/z 429.742+) and (D) βT (m/z 569.633+).

Figure S-3 displays MSn analysis of a representative DHSO interlinked BSA
peptide,
which was measured as a quadruply charged ion (m/z 692.84754+) in MS1 (Figure S-3A). Its MS2 spectrum revealed
two pairs of complementary MS2 fragment ions, i.e., αA/βT and αT/βA (Figure S-3B), further demonstrating
the robust fragmentation expected of DHSO interlinked peptides. Together
with MS3 sequencing of MS2 fragments αA (m/z 616.322+) and βT (m/z 760.362+) (Figure S-3C,D), this DHSO interlinked
peptide was unambiguously identified as [66LVNEALTEFAK75 interlinked to 89SLHTLFGDETLCK100], in which residue E69 cross-linked to residue
E97 in BSA.

In addition to interlinked peptides, intralinked
peptides were
also observed as a result of DHSO cross-linking of our model proteins.
For example, MS2 fragmentation of an intralinked myoglobin
peptide (Figure S-4) produced a single
fragment ion peak αA+T (m/z 514.024+) 18 Da less than its parent ion, consistent
with the expected fragmentation pattern described in Figure S-1B following dehydration of the sulfenic acid moiety
to an unsaturated thiol moiety. Analysis of the αA+T ion in subsequent MS3 analysis (Figure S-4C) yielded a series of b and y ions permitting the unambiguous
identification of two peptides sharing identical sequences but transposed
alkene and unsaturated thiol moieties: 105YLEAFISDTAIIHVLHSK119 and 05YLETFISDAAIIHVLHSK119, indicating an intralink
between residues E106 and D110.

MS2 fragmentation
of a myoglobin dead-end modified peptide
(m/z 604.30953+) resulted
in the detection of a single pair of fragment ions αA/αT (m/z 559.303+/569.963+) (Figure S-5), consistent with the expected fragmentation pattern described in Figure S-1C. These fragment ions were then identified
by MS3 analysis as 18VEAADIAGHGQEVLIR32 and 18VETADIAGHGQEVLIR32, respectively, representing a dead-end cross-link located on E19
of myoglobin (Figure S-5C,D).

In
total, LC–MSn analysis of
DHSO cross-linked myoglobin identified 33 unique interlinked peptides,
representing 32 unique D|E-D|E linkages (Table S-1). Similarly, 62 unique DHSO interlinked BSA peptides were
identified, describing 69 unique D|E-D|E linkages (Table S-2). Collectively, the results presented thus far indicate
that DHSO can effectively cross-link acidic residue containing peptides
and proteins in the presence of DMTMM at neutral pH. More importantly,
our results have demonstrated that DHSO cross-linked peptides indeed
exhibit the same characteristic MS2 fragmentation patterns
as expected to allow their facile and accurate identification.

DHSO Cross-Linking
Maps of Myoglobin and BSA
In order
to assess the efficacy and sequence coverage of DHSO cross-linking
on our model proteins, we generated cross-linking maps of myoglobin
and BSA based on their identified DHSO interlinked peptides. The secondary
structures of equine myoglobin comprise of eight α-helices and
one short 310 helix (PDB 1DWR) (Figure 4A). The globular nature of myoglobin suggests that
many of the helices are in close proximity to one another in three-dimensional
space. The DHSO cross-link map of myoglobin based on the 33 unique
D|E-D|E linkages is illustrated in Figure 4B, describing numerous intra- and inter-secondary
structure interactions (i.e., α1-α5, α1-α8,
α2-α4, α3-α4, α3-α8, α4-α5,
α4-α8, α6-α8, α7-α8, and α8-α8).
To further evaluate the identified cross-links, we mapped the cross-linked
residues onto the crystal structure of myoglobin and calculated the
distances between their alpha carbons (Cα-Cα distances)
(Figure 4D,F). Considering
the spacer length of DHSO (12.4 Å) and the distances contributed
by D|E side chains (3.8 Å|4.9 Å, respectively), as well
as backbone flexibility and structural dynamics, the upper limit for
the Cα-Cα distances between DHSO cross-linked acidic residues
is estimated to be ∼30 Å. Therefore, we have set the distance
threshold for cross-linkable D|E residues as 30 Å. A total of
27 of the 32 myoglobin DHSO cross-links were mapped in the structure,
with 26 having Cα-Cα distances <30 Å and one link
slightly over the maximum distance at 31.1 Å. The remaining 5
linkages were not mapped on to the structure because they were identified
as sites of oligomerization, in which identical residues or peptide
sequences were cross-linked together.

Similarly, a DHSO cross-link map of BSA was generated based
on
the 69 unique D|E-D|E linkages (Figure 5A). When mapped to a previously published BSA crystal
structure (PDB 4F5S), 64 out of 69 BSA linkages (93%) were calculated to have Cα-Cα
distances below 30 Å (Figure S-6A,C). Structural flexibility and/or oligomerization of BSA likely contribute
to the other five identified linkages found to be >30 Å. As
shown
in Figure 5A, DHSO
interlinks were distributed throughout the primary sequence of BSA,
with regions of dense cross-link clusters identified in regions with
higher α-helix density. This even distribution is likely due
to the dispersion of aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues throughout
the protein. Collectively, our results suggest that DHSO cross-linking
yields cross-links within expected distance constraints useful for
structural elucidation for computational modeling in the same way
as lysine cross-linked data.

Comparison of MS-Cleavable
and Noncleavable Acidic Residue Cross-Linking
Previously,
two noncleavable acidic residue cross-linkers, i.e.,
adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH) and pimetic acid dihydrazide (PDH),
were used for probing the structure of bovine serum albumin,21 which resulted in the identification of 27 and
35 unique acidic residue linkages, respectively.21 A comparison of the linkage maps generated for DHSO, ADH,
and PDH cross-linking of BSA (Figure 5A–C) revealed a high degree of similarity in
proximally cross-linked regions. Apart from covering interaction regions
cross-linked by ADH and PDH, DHSO cross-linking resulted in 34 additional
unique D|E-D|E linkages. These unique DHSO cross-links are generally
clustered in regions of particularly high acidic residue density,
such as the regions between D25 and D97, E250 and E344, and D405 to
E494 (Figure 5A–C).
Limitations in bioinformatics software for analyzing noncleavable
cross-linked peptides have been previously noted,21 which made the accurate identification of acidic residue
cross-linked peptides considerably more challenging due to their higher
frequency and corresponding increase in search space. In contrast,
CID induced cleavage of DHSO cross-linked peptides during MS2 significantly simplified subsequent peptide sequencing in MS3. Given the same acidic residue reactive chemistry, the increase
in identified cross-links using DHSO is mainly attributed to the simplified
cross-link identification with improved accuracy afforded by MS-cleavability
of DHSO cross-linked peptides. This ultimately facilitates unambiguous
identification of individual linkages amidst peptides with multiple
acidic residues in sequence. These results demonstrate the advantage
of using DHSO, a MS-cleavable cross-linking reagent targeting acidic
residues for probing protein–protein interactions over noncleavable
reagents.

Comparison of DHSO and DSSO Cross-Linking
To assess
the complementarity between acidic residue and primary amine cross-linking
data, we examined the similarities and differences between DHSO and
DSSO cross-linking of our selected model proteins. To this end, we
also carried out LC–MSn analyses
of DSSO cross-linked myoglobin and BSA, respectively. As summarized
in Tables S-3 and S-4, 19 unique DSSO interlinked
myoglobin peptides and 33 unique DSSO interlinked BSA peptides were
identified. These linkages were then mapped onto their corresponding
protein linear sequences (Figures 4C and 5D) and crystal structures
(Figure 4E and Figure S-6B). As a result, all of myoglobin DSSO
cross-links (Figure 4F) and 94% of BSA DSSO cross-links corresponded to Cα-Cα
distances ≤30 Å (Figure S-6C). The two BSA cross-links that are outside the distance range may
be a result of unexpected structural flexibility.

In the case
of myoglobin, DSSO cross-linking identified several proximal helicase
regions, such as α4-α5, α4-α7, α5-α8,
α6-α8, and α5-310. In comparison, there
is limited overlap between DHSO and DSSO cross-link maps except in
regions containing α4-α5 and α6-α8 (Figure 4B,C), indicating
that DHSO and DSSO cross-linking mapped different parts of interactions
within myoglobin. The identified helicase interacting regions unique
to DHSO or DSSO cross-linking correspond well with the number of cross-linkable
residues and specific reactive chemistries. This is due to the fact
that lysine and acidic residues are distributed unevenly across the
myoglobin sequence. For example, the N-terminal region of myoglobin
(residues 1–41) spanning helices α1 through α3
contains only one lysine but four glutamic acids and two aspartic
acid residues. Therefore, profiling the interactions of the N-terminus
within itself and with other parts of the protein will be difficult
with amine-reactive cross-linking reagent such as DSSO. In contrast,
acidic residue reactive cross-linker DHSO would be better suited for
this purpose. Indeed, while DSSO was not able to cover this region
as expected, DHSO cross-linking enabled the identification of 11 interlinked
peptides describing multiple interactions between the N-terminus and
other parts of the protein (i.e., α1-α5, α1-α8,
α2-α4, α3-α4, and α3-α8). While
DHSO provided exclusive data from the lysine scarce N-terminus, the
lysine-rich 310 helix and many of the loop regions between
the helical structures were better analyzed by DSSO due to the higher
abundance of lysine residues in these regions. Together, these results
demonstrate that acidic residue cross-linking can provide complementary
structural information to that obtained using amine-reactive cross-linkers.

Interestingly, unlike myoglobin, DHSO and DSSO cross-linking of
BSA have resulted in much more similar cross-linking profiles, meaning
that similar interactions within BSA were identified (Figure 5A,D). This is most likely owing
to the fact that BSA has more evenly dispersed distribution of lysine,
aspartic acid, and glutamic acid residues throughout the protein sequence.
Thus, combined usage of DHSO and DSSO can strengthen the validity
of the cross-links identified by any of the two reagents individually.
More importantly, this will generate complementary structural information
to facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of protein structures.

Conclusion
Here we report the development and characterization
of a new acidic
residue-targeting, sulfoxide-containing MS-cleavable cross-linker,
dihydrazide sulfoxide (DHSO), which is a new derivative of our previously
developed amine-reactive MS-cleavable reagent, DSSO.14 Our analyses here have proven that DHSO cross-linked peptides
possess the same characteristics distinctive to peptides cross-linked
by sulfoxide-containing amine-reactive cross-linkers,14−16 thus permitting their fast and accurate identification by MSn analysis. The unique features of DHSO will
significantly facilitate cross-linking studies targeting acidic residues,
which has been difficult in the past due to the large number of D|E
present in protein sequences and complexity of their resulting cross-linked
peptides for MS analysis. Comparison of DHSO and DSSO cross-linking
confirms the need of expanding the coverage of protein interactions
using cross-linkers targeting different residues, especially when
the distribution of specific amino acids is uneven. In summary, this
work further demonstrates the robustness and potential of our XL-MS
technology based on sulfoxide-containing MS-cleavable cross-linkers
and provides a viable analytical platform for the development of new
MS-cleavable cross-linker derivatives to further define protein–protein
interactions. The development of these new tools will aid in the goal
of understanding the structural dynamics of protein complexes at the
global scale in the future.
