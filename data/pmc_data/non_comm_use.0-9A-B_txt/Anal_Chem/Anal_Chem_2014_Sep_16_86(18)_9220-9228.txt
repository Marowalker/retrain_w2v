Silver
clusters with ∼10 atoms form within DNA strands,
and the conjugates are chemical sensors. The DNA host hybridizes with
short oligonucleotides, and the cluster moieties optically respond
to these analytes. Our studies focus on how the cluster adducts perturb
the structure of their DNA hosts. Our sensor is comprised of an oligonucleotide
with two components: a 5′-cluster domain that complexes silver
clusters and a 3′-recognition site that hybridizes with a target
oligonucleotide. The single-stranded sensor encapsulates an ∼11
silver atom cluster with violet absorption at 400 nm and with minimal
emission. The recognition site hybridizes with complementary oligonucleotides,
and the violet cluster converts to an emissive near-infrared cluster
with absorption at 730 nm. Our key finding is that the near-infrared
cluster coordinates two of its hybridized hosts. The resulting tertiary
structure was investigated using intermolecular and intramolecular
variants of the same dimer. The intermolecular dimer assembles in
concentrated (∼5 μM) DNA solutions. Strand stoichiometries
and orientations were chromatographically determined using thymine-modified
complements that increase the overall conjugate size. The intramolecular
dimer develops within a DNA scaffold that is founded on three linked
duplexes. The high local cluster concentrations and relative strand
arrangements again favor the antiparallel dimer for the near-infrared
cluster. When the two monomeric DNA/violet cluster conjugates transform
to one dimeric DNA/near-infrared conjugate, the DNA strands accumulate
silver. We propose that these correlated changes in DNA structure
and silver stoichiometry underlie the violet to near-infrared cluster
transformation.

Gold and
silver clusters with
diameters <1 nm have ≲40 atoms.1 Because of their small sizes, these clusters have sparsely organized
electronic states and exhibit structured optical spectra, strong emission,
weakly coupled states, and significant highest occupied molecular
orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO–LUMO)
energy gaps.1−4 Cluster stoichiometry, structure, and oxidation state dictate the
molecule-like electronic organizations of silver clusters, and specific
clusters differ significantly in their optical, electronic, and catalytic
properties.5−9 Our studies utilize spectral and photophysical differences between
clusters and optically identify specific oligonucleotides (Figure 1). This detection strategy uses DNA ligands to form
specific cluster adducts. The electron-rich functional groups within
the DNA nucleobases coordinate and stabilize surface atoms and curtail
cluster growth.10−15 Encapsulated clusters have ∼10 silver atoms and form optical
labels with ε ∼ 105 M–1 cm–1 and ϕf ∼ 30%.16−18 Both DNA sequence and structure define binding sites for silver
clusters. Different primary sequences create clusters with discrete,
resolved electronic bands that span the visible and near-infrared
regions.16,17,19,20 Secondary and tertiary DNA structure also distinguish
silver clusters. For example, protonation reversibly regulates the
folded structure of a cytosine-rich DNA strand and its associated
environment for a red-emitting silver cluster.21

DNA structures and cluster binding sites are also
controlled by
complementary strands. Oligonucleotide hosts for silver clusters are
large in relation to their ∼10 silver atom adducts, so they
can integrate cluster binding sites and recognition sites for analytes.22−27 Such DNA strands hybridize with oligonucleotide analytes and trigger
large fluorescence changes and absorption shifts in their cluster
moieties.13−15,22,26,28,29 Their stark spectral and photophysical changes rival the responses
from other sensors such as molecular beacons.22,28,30 Furthermore, silver cluster labels are conveniently
synthesized in situ using a DNA template, Ag+, and the
reducing agent BH4–. To understand how
these silver cluster/DNA conjugates optically sense analytes, we designed
a general oligonucleotide sensor with a 5′ component that complexes
silver clusters and a 3′ component that hybridizes with a target
oligonucleotide.28,31 This composite single-stranded
oligonucleotide exclusively forms an ∼11 silver atom cluster
with violet absorption and minimal emission. The resulting DNA/cluster
conjugate hybridizes with the target complementary strand and adopts
a mixed single-/double-stranded secondary structure. In concert with
this structural change, the violet cluster converts to a near-infrared
cluster with a >300 nm shift in absorption and an ∼60-fold
emission enhancement (Figure 1). The spectra
of this latter cluster lie within the optical window where scattering,
absorption, and endogenous emission from biological samples are minimized.32 Thus, this bright, high-contrast fluorophore
is a promising label and reporter for vivo sensing and imaging.33,34

Our studies establish a link between optical switching by
the cluster
moieties and aggregation by the DNA hosts. Two variants explore this
noncanonical DNA assembly. An intermolecular DNA aggregate was identified
by appending thymines on the target complementary strand and increasing
the overall conjugate size. A mixture of normal and thymine-tagged
complements generates three near-infrared conjugates, and their chromatographic
distribution reveals a dimeric DNA host with antiparallel strand orientations.
The conjugate stoichiometry, structure, and stability suggest that
the DNA dimerizes because the near-infrared cluster coordinates two
of its DNA hosts. An intramolecular variant of this same DNA dimer
develops within a larger DNA scaffold. This scaffold expands the scope
of DNA ligands for silver clusters because hybridization directs the
cluster transformation. The scaffold is founded on a mediating duplex
that cohybridizes with two DNA/violet cluster conjugates. The composite
ligand locally concentrates the two violet clusters and facilitates
transformation to the near-infrared cluster. The resulting near-infrared
cluster/DNA conjugate substantiates the stoichiometry and structure
of its intermolecular analogue. Furthermore, the scaffold constrains
the cluster environment through the length of its mediating duplex.
These allosteric changes support substantial overlap of the encapsulating
strands in the dimer. The dimeric DNA host also amasses silver atoms
from its two monomeric DNA/violet cluster precursors. Our studies
evaluate this relationship between DNA structure, silver stoichiometry,
and optical switching from the violet to near-infrared clusters.

Experimental
Section
Our synthetic protocol and characterization followed
earlier studies.28 The oligonucleotides
used for these studies
are listed in Table 1. The precursor violet
cluster-DNA conjugate was formed by mixing 90 μM solution of
the oligonucleotide S1-S2 with 8 equiv of Ag+/oligonucleotide
in a 10 mM citrate/citric acid buffer at pH = 6.5 with [Na+] ≈ 26 mM.35 The Ag+ was reduced with 4 equiv of BH4–/oligonucleotide.27 This solution was exposed to 500 psi O2 at room temperature for >3 h to favor the precursor violet cluster.
Complementary strands form the near-infrared cluster in solutions
with 300 mM Na+. Absorption spectra were acquired with
a Cary 50 (Varian), and emission spectra were acquired with a FluoroMax-3
(Jobin Yvon). Size exclusion chromatography was conducted with a Shimadzu
Prominence high-performance liquid chromatography system using a 300
mm × 7.8 mm BioSep-SEC-S2000 column (Phenomenex), having 5 μm
particles and a pore size of 145 Å. The mobile phase was buffered
at pH = 6.5 with 10 mM citrate/citric acid that was supplemented with
NaClO4 to minimize solute interactions with the stationary
phase.36 To assess hydrodynamic radii,
size standards were based on the thymine oligonucleotides dT10, dT15, dT20, and dT30.21,37

S1 designates the cluster domain, S2 designates the recognition site,
S2C is the complementary strand for the recognition site, X and Y
are the duplex components. For the latter sequences, the subscripts
designate the number of nucleotides in the strand. Oligonucleotides
were received from Integrated DNA Technologies as lyophilized and
desalted samples and were used without further purification. The oligonucleotides
were dissolved in water, and their concentrations were measured using
the absorbance at 260 nm based on extinction coefficients derived
from the nearest-neighbor approximation. Concentrations were measured
in a 10 mM boric acid/borate buffer with pH = 9.8, which disrupts
aggregates favored by cytosine-rich strands.58,59 Duplexes were annealed by heating equimolar amounts of single strands
together to 95 °C for 5 min with slow cooling to room temperature
for >5 h. 

Results
A silver cluster with near-infrared absorption and emission develops
a higher-order DNA structure. Below, we describe the spectral development
of this cluster and the structural transformation of its DNA host.

DNA Structure
Dictates Cluster Environments
Our studies
are based on the core oligonucleotide S1-S2. Its two components dictate
the secondary structures and cluster environments of this strand (Figure 1).28 The 5′-S1
sequence CCCACCCACCCTCCCA (black) was chosen because this sequence
favors near-infrared silver clusters.38 This cluster domain was linked via dT2 to the 3′-S2
recognition site (red). This component binds a complementary strand
S2C (green), and we chose to detect single-stranded DNA because this
analyte forms strong, specific complexes with the complementary recognition
site. In this and earlier studies, the sequence and length of S2 and
S2C were varied to demonstrate modular DNA detection, and we first
describe studies with the sequences S2a and S2Ca (Table 1).27,31 The key to
our detection strategy is that the composite S1-S2 exclusively forms
an ∼11 silver atom cluster with λmax = 400
nm (solid line) and with minimal emission (dotted line) (Figure 1, left). DNA strands can produce a range of clusters,
but this violet species emerges over alternate clusters by using relatively
low Ag+/DNA concentrations, low ionic strength buffers,
and high O2 concentrations.27,38,39

Figure 1 Reaction scheme with absorption (solid line) and emission
(dotted
lines) spectra associated with the S1-S2a/violet cluster
complex (left) and the S1-S2/S2Ca/near-infrared cluster
complex (right).

Our studies focus on
the successor to this cluster. The single-stranded
S1-S2a/violet cluster conjugate hybridizes with its complement
S2Ca, and the resulting S1-S2a/S2Ca now favors a strongly emissive cluster with λex,max = 730 nm (solid line) and λem,max = 800 nm (dotted
line) (Figure 1, right). Hybridization recovers
the near-infrared cluster that is favored by the S1 sequence alone,
and this cluster transformation optically signals the target oligonucleotide.40 We explored the reasons for the cluster conversion
by measuring the DNA stoichiometry and structure of the DNA/near-infrared
cluster complex.

Cluster Promotes DNA Assembly
We
first summarize our
prior studies that showed DNA stoichiometry distinguishes the near-infrared
cluster/DNA conjugate from its native S1-S2a/S2Ca host.28 Two variants, S2Ca and dT10-S2Ca, used the same complementary
sequence for S2a (Table 1). On the
latter complement, the thymine appendage is chemically innocuous because
it projects away from the S1 cluster domain and because neutral pH
protonates and blocks the N3 cluster binding site on thymine.28,41 Individually, S2Ca and dT10-S2Ca hybridize with the S1-S2a/violet cluster conjugate and
produce single conjugates with different sizes. However, their equal
mixture produces a third intermediate species (Figure 2a). The resulting temporal and intensity distribution enumerates
the S2Ca constituents and the S1-S2a/S2Ca stoichiometry. Retention times in size exclusion chromatography
depend on hydrodynamic radius, and this trend is supported by the
later (peak a) and earlier (peak c) elution of near-infrared cluster
conjugates with the smaller S2Ca and the larger dT10-S2Ca, respectively. The intermediate retention
time (peak b) suggests that this species has a mixture of both complements.
In addition, this species has an ∼2-fold higher intensity than
its neighboring peaks, and this pattern suggests that two equivalent
S2a recognition sites statistically favor both the S2Ca and dT10-S2Ca complements. Thus, the
triplet chromatographic pattern supports a dimeric (S1-S2/S2C)2 host for the near-infrared cluster. This DNA stoichiometry
was substantiated by two other measurements.28 The extinction coefficients of the DNA and cluster chromophores
were measured using absorption and fluorescence correlation spectroscopies,
and their ratio also supports a 1:2 cluster/S1-S2a/S2Ca stoichiometry. Fluorescence anisotropy showed that the aggregated
cluster conjugate is larger than its native S1-S2a/S2Ca host.

Figure 2 (a) Equimolar amounts of S2Ca and dT10-S2Ca yielded three near-infrared conjugates with different
numbers
of protruding thymines. (b) Two models for the parallel and antiparallel
orientations of the two S1-S2a/S2Ca strands.

Our new studies use the triplet
chromatographic pattern and evaluate
S1-S2a orientations within the dimer. The three near-infrared
clusters have 0, 1, and 2 protruding dT10 appendages, which
alter conjugate retention times and sizes (Figure 2a, peaks a, b, and c, respectively). The relative arrangement
of these appendages dictates the temporal splitting between the peaks,
which we interpret using two models (Figure 2b). With a parallel S1-S2 arrangement, the thymine appendages are
adjacent. The resulting size changes are expected to be smaller from
1 → 2 vs 0 → 1 appendages, so the chromatographic pattern
would be asymmetric. With an antiparallel S1-S2 arrangement, the thymines
project from opposing ends of the dimer. The size changes from 0 →
1 and 1 → 2 appendages are expected to be similar, thus the
chromatographic pattern would be more symmetric. The temporal splittings
were related to size shifts by using the logarithmic relationship
between retention time and hydrodynamic radius (Supporting Information).42 On the
basis of the dimer with no appendages (peak a, Figure 2a), the size changes due to one (peak b) and two appendages
(peak c) are designated α and β, respectively. A relative
change β/α = 1.94 ± 0.08 suggests that the appendages
contribute equally to the size changes and supports their opposing
arrangement. Thus, temporal splitting pattern supports antiparallel
orientations for the two S1-S2a/S2Ca strands
that host the near-infrared cluster.

The antiparallel model
suggests that the overall complex has an
elongated shape. We used two experiments to investigate its global
structure. First, dT20 replaced the smaller dT10 appendage on S2Ca (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). As with the above dT10 studies, S2Ca and dT20-S2Ca also
produce a triplet chromatographic pattern but with improved resolution.
The dimers that form with dT20-S2Ca further
substantiate the antiparallel over the parallel model because we expect
bulky substituents to favor opposing ends of the dimer. The (S1-S2a/S2Ca)2 dimers with two vs one dT20 appendages have a relative size change β/α =
1.90 ± 0.04, which is comparable to the value with the dT10 tags. This ∼2-fold size increment suggests that both
dT20 appendages contribute equally to the overall size
changes and lengthen the dimer along a major, rodlike axis. Second,
DNA duplexes with 11, 20, and 40 base pairs provide a structural basis
to interpret the dimer shape (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). Short, B-form DNA duplexes form stiff
polymers, and their lengths systematically shift chromatographic retention
times.43 These calibration standards show
that the near-infrared cluster/DNA conjugate has a length comparable
to a ∼38 base pair duplex. On the basis of its primary sequence,
the antiparallel dimer has a similar length of 44 nucleotides: two
terminal 12 base pair duplexes and dT2 linkers flank two
overlapped 16 nucleotide S1 cluster domains (Figure 2b). This length comparison does not consider the flexibility
and strand overlap in the dimer, which are addressed later in the
paper.

Intermolecular vs Intramolecular Assembly
DNA concentration
controls the violet to near-infrared cluster transformation, and we
studied two samples with 5 and 0.5 μM concentrations of the
S1-S2b/violet conjugate and complement S2Cb (Figure 3a). Their spectra compensate for the concentration
differences by using pathlengths of 1 and 10 cm, respectively. The
spectra show that the more dilute solution retained stronger violet
absorption and yielded lower near-infrared absorption. These correlated
changes support an intermolecular (S1-S2/S2C)2 complex
because lower concentrations inhibit its assembly via two monomeric
S1-S2/violet cluster complexes.

5 (solid line) and 0.5 (dashed
line) μM S1-S2b/violet cluster conjugates and S2Cb. (b) Model for constituents in the DNA scaffold. (c) Fluorescence
spectra for samples with 25 nM S2Cb-X21/Y21-S2Cb (solid line) and 50 nM S2Cb (dashed
line) with 50 nM S1-S2b/violet cluster conjugate.

While this DNA dimer innately
forms in more concentrated solutions,
it also develops within the confines of a larger DNA construct (Figure 3b). This alternative synthetic strategy parallels
the intermolecular DNA reaction: S1-S2b/violet cluster
conjugates hybridize with complementary S2Cb strands and
form the near-infrared cluster. The new approach chemically links
the S2Cb strands (Figure 3b). The
overall construct assembles via three hybridizations. The complementary
strands X21-S2Cb and Y21-S2Cb hybridize via their 21-nucleotide X21 and Y21 components (heavy black lines). The resulting duplex S2Cb-X21/Y21-S2Cb has protruding
S2Cb appendages (green lines), which cohybridize with two
S1-S2b/violet cluster conjugates (black and red lines,
respectively). The 21-base pair duplex X21/Y21 separates the violet clusters by ∼7 nm and imposes an ∼18
mM local concentration, and such high concentrations should favor
the near-infrared cluster (Figure 3a). Intermolecular
vs intramolecular dimerization were distinguished using two solutions
with identical net concentrations of S2Cb: a 25 nM solution
of the linked S2Cb strands (solid line) and a 50 nM solution
of S2Cb alone (dashed line) (Figure 3c). These solutions also contained 50 nM S1-S2b/violet
cluster. The independent complement S2Cb produces relatively
low emission, which is expected because this solution was 10-fold
more dilute than the 0.5 μM solution used in Figure 3a. Thus, even lower DNA concentrations should further
constrain intermolecular dimerization and near-infrared cluster development.
In contrast, the linked S2Cb strands produce strong near-infrared
emission. The contrasting emission intensities suggest that the DNA
construct concentrates S1–S2b/violet cluster conjugates
and promotes intramolecular near-infrared cluster formation. This
DNA-directed cluster transformation was further interrogated by identifying
the scaffold constituents that support the near-infrared cluster.

DNA Scaffold: Components and Structure
While the DNA
scaffold is expected to assemble through hybridization, we also mapped
its three major constituents using the near-infrared cluster emission
(Figure 4). First, the relative amounts of
the duplex components X21 and Y21 were determined
by continuous variation analysis (Figure 4a).44,45 Mole fractions (χ) of X21-S2Cb and Y21-S2Cb were varied, while the net concentrations
of the S1-S2b/violet cluster conjugates and their complementary
S2Cb sequences were maintained at constant 100 nM concentrations.
The relative amount χ = 0.55 ± 0.08 yields the strongest
near-infrared emission. This optimal ∼1:1 X21-S2Cb/Y21-S2Cb stoichiometry indicates that
the complementary X21 and Y21 sequences hybridize
and form a duplex within the composite DNA structure. Second, two
S2C components were identified by using different sequences (Figure 4b). S2Cb and S2Cc were designed
to exclusively hybridize with S1-S2b/ and S1-S2c/violet cluster complexes, respectively (Table 1). The core duplex S2Cb-X21/Y21-S2Cc produces low emission with either S1-S2b (dotted
line) or S1-S2c (dashed line) alone but strong emission
with their mixture (solid line). This favorable heterogeneous combination
indicates that two S2C/S2 duplexes emanate from the X21/Y21 duplex. Third, the S1-S2 components were enumerated
with a 3′-dT20 appendage (Figure 4c). This approach parallels our earlier studies of the intermolecular
dimer because the thymine tag enlarges the overall conjugate and distinguishes
DNA dimers (Figure 2). S1-S2b-dT20 and S1-S2b form violet cluster conjugates, and
these hybridize with S2Cb-X21/Y21-S2Cb. Three near-infrared conjugates result. The fastest
and slowest species incorporate only S1-S2b-dT20 or S1-S2b, respectively (Figure S3a in the Supporting Information). The intermediate species
exhibits two key characteristics: it elutes between and produces higher
emission than the flanking homogeneous analogues. These characteristics
suggest that the intermediate species is statistically favored because
it incorporates both S1-S2b-dT20 and S1-S2b. The intensity distribution favors the larger conjugate when
the relative amount of S1-S2b-dT20/S1–S2b is increased from 1:1 to 1.5:1 (Figure S3b in the Supporting Information). This shift suggests
that bulky thymine appendages inhibit scaffold assembly. Thus, the
triplet pattern indicates that the scaffold incorporates the two S1-S2
strands that coordinate the near-infrared cluster. To summarize, these
three experiments support a composite DNA ligand that consists of
an X/Y duplex with two terminal S2/S2C duplexes. This construct uses
sequence-specific hybridization and directs the dimerization of two
S1 hosts for the near-infrared cluster.

analysis used solutions with fixed 100
nM concentrations of S1-S2b/violet cluster conjugates and

X21/Y21 appended with two different complementary
strands S2Cb and S2Cc. (c) Size exclusion chromatogram
following the reaction of violet conjugates with S1-S2b and S1-S2b-dT20 (dashed, blue appendage) with
S2Cb-X21/Y21-S2Cb.

The DNA scaffold also directs
S1-S2 orientations within the dimer.
These orientations are reflected in the shapes of the native and cluster
forms of the scaffold. The native form (dotted line, Figure 5) elutes earlier than S2Cb-X21/Y21-S2Cb alone (dashed line) because it acquires
S1-S2b/S2Cb appendages. The cluster form of
this composite DNA (solid line) elutes later than the corresponding
native form. Its compact structure suggests that the near-infrared
cluster retracts the two S1 appendages from the two ends of the X21/Y21 duplex and forms a S1-S1 dimer with antiparallel
orientations. In summary, both the intermolecular and intramolecular
synthetic routes produce the same near-infrared cluster that is encapsulated
by two S1strands with antiparallel orientations.

and the cluster variant of this latter DNA construct.

DNA Scaffold: Allosteric Control
The DNA scaffold facilitates
the cluster transformation by hybridizing with and concentrating two
violet cluster conjugates. Furthermore, the scaffold also manipulates
the cluster conversion through its structure, and we examined how
the length of the X/Y duplex remotely alters overlap between the encapsulating
strands (Figure 6). Duplexes with 11, 21, 32,
and 42 base pairs form rigid spacers and systematically separate their
S2C appendages.43 These duplex lengths
preserve the relative phases of the hybridized S1-S2 appendages.46,47 The four S2Cb-X/Y-S2Cb constructs produce
two types of near-infrared cluster conjugates. Larger species (marked
with open circles) elute earlier, and their intensities diminish with
heating. These characteristics suggest that the near-infrared clusters
bind to higher-order, intermolecular aggregates. Our studies focus
on the more compact species (marked with stars) that elute later and
are robust with heating. These characteristics suggest that one S2Cb-X/Y-S2Cb duplex and two S1-S2b/violet
cluster conjugates form one composite ligand for the near-infrared
cluster (Figure 3b). These intramolecular conjugates
have retention times that progressively decrease from 7.85 to 7.15
min as the duplex length increases from 11 to 42 base pairs. This
trend suggests that the overall size of the DNA/cluster conjugate
tracks the X/Y duplex length. The duplexes also control cluster emission,
and the 21-base pair duplex produces the highest emission. This duplex
has a similar length to the 16 nucleotide S1 cluster domain, and strong
emission supports substantial S1-S1 overlap within the dimer.

Discussion
Our
studies address how silver cluster-DNA conjugates identify
analytes, and the sensor strand S1-S2 serves two purposes. It hybridizes
with the target analyte S2C and hosts two silver clusters with distinct
optical signatures. The precursor single-stranded S1-S2 encapsulates
a violet cluster, while its analyte complex S1-S2/S2C exclusively
hosts an emissive near-infrared cluster (Figure 1). Our key observation is that the near-infrared cluster not only
signals analyte-sensor association but also coordinates two of its
DNA host strands. To demonstrate the scope of the structural transformation,
we review our prior studies of the violet cluster complex with S1-S2.27,31 This cluster has a stoichiometry of ∼11 Ag/S1-S2 and forms
a monomeric complex with S1-S2. Although it is small in relation to
its 30 nucleotide hosts, this cluster alters DNA structure and stability.
It contracts the hydrodynamic radii of native S1-S2 strands by ∼40%.28 It also thermodynamically stabilizes single-stranded
S1-S2 and inhibits S2/S2C hybridization.31 Both effects suggest that the violet cluster contracts and stabilizes
its single-stranded DNA host because it coordinates multiple nucleobases.
These results indicate that S1-S2 is a multidentate ligand, and this
class of ligand finely regulates cluster environments through the
positions of their coordinating groups.48,49 We are now
altering the sequence of coordinating nucleobases within S1-S2 to
analogously modulate the binding site for the violet cluster.

Our new studies show that the near-infrared cluster also forms
multidentate complexes with DNA. In contrast to the violet cluster
that forms a monomeric intrastrand complex, the near-infrared cluster
assembles two strands and yields an interstrand (S1-S2/S2C)2 dimer. Our studies established its DNA stoichiometry and structure
(Figure 2). The stoichiometry was deduced because
the aggregate independently binds two S2C complements, and the tertiary
structure was determined because the two complements bind on opposite
ends of the dimer. This strand arrangement juxtaposes two single-stranded
S1 sequences, which suggests that an S1-S1 dimer anchors the overall
DNA structure. These native C3AC3AC3TC3A sequences do not inherently self-associate, even
when confined within a DNA scaffold (Figure 5). Furthermore, the cytosine-rich strands disfavor base pairing in
basic solutions, yet the near-infrared cluster/(S1-S2/S2C)2 complex still forms up to pH = 10.50,18 This stability
suggests that the near-infrared cluster assembles the two S1 strands.
This cluster favors the single-stranded S1 sequence because it has
a high proportion of cytosine, whose N3 preferentially coordinates
silver clusters.19,38,40,51,52 Theoretical
calculations show that multiple cytosines preferentially stabilize
small silver clusters.52 On the basis of
these observations, we suggest that the near-infrared cluster complexes
with the S1 cluster domain and complexes with the cytosines in two
S1 cluster domains. Intermolecular association via silver clusters
may be a common structural trait because mass spectrometry studies
have identified other dimeric oligonucleotide complexes with silver
clusters.39 This technique favors gas-phase
aggregates because droplet desolvation produces high DNA/cluster concentrations.
Our studies demonstrate that the near-infrared cluster-DNA aggregate
forms in dilute aqueous solutions with nanomolar DNA concentrations
(Figure 3). We are particularly interested
in the stability of such aggregates because they may depend on the
reaction conditions. For example, a near-infrared cluster forms a
1:1 cluster/DNA complex with the isolated S1 sequence.38 This conjugate was studied using nonpolar solvents,
so we are currently investigating the cluster/(S1-S2/S2C)2 complex using different solvents.

DNA assembly via the near-infrared
silver cluster is hindered in
dilute solutions, but hybridization facilitates the cluster transformation
under these challenging reaction conditions (Figure 3c). Two S1-S2 strands hybridize with two S2C complements on
the duplex S2C-X21/Y21-S2C. The resulting DNA
framework concentrates their violet cluster adducts and forms the
near-infrared cluster. This scaffold preserves the dimeric stoichiometry
and the antiparallel orientations of the S1-S2 strands that are also
found in the intermolecular near-infrared cluster analogue (Figure 3b). Beyond facilitating the cluster transformation,
the scaffold allosterically alters the cluster environment. We studied
how remote variations in the X/Y duplex length adjust the near-infrared
cluster environment (Figure 6). Four intervening
duplexes rigidly separate their S1-S2/violet cluster appendages and
modulate the resulting near-infrared cluster emission. Prominent emission
from the 21-base pair duplex reflects a preferred cluster binding
site. We propose that this environment develops because the X21/Y21 duplex has a length that allows optimal overlap
of its 16 nucleotide S1 sequences. We are now studying finer variations
in the X/Y duplex lengths to adjust S1-S1 overlap in the dimer.

The scaffold for the cluster transformation shares several characteristics
with DNA templates for organic reactions.53,54 Both constructs use sequence-specific hybridization to stringently
control chemical transformations, produce high local reactant concentrations
that promote the reactions, require no exogenous reagents for signal
transduction, and yield high contrast signals against inherently low
backgrounds. The silver cluster transformations are distinct because
the DNA strands are integral reaction components. Thus, the scaffold
structure can dictate the positions of the S1 cluster domains and
thereby modulate cluster reactivity. We showed that the X/Y duplex
length allosterically modulates the near-infrared cluster environment.
We are now investigating the junctions within the DNA framework. In
this paper, single-stranded dT2 junctions connected the
X/Y duplex, the S2/S2C duplexes, and the S1 cluster domains. These
flexible junctions promote DNA folding, but rigid four- and three-way
junctions could more carefully control S1-S1 overlap in the dimer.47,55 We are particularly interested in the relationship between the strand
overlap and the electronic environment for the cluster.19

The DNA structural changes provide a foundation
to understand optical
switching by the cluster moieties. The near-infrared cluster assembles
two S1-S2/S2C strands via two violet cluster complexes with S1-S2.
The overall silver stoichiometry is conserved because each monomeric
S1-S2/violet cluster complex has ∼11 Ag while the dimeric (S1-S2/S2C)2/near-infrared cluster successor has ∼22 Ag.28 Silver clusters in this size range have sparsely
organized electronic states, and their electronic spectra depend on
cluster stoichiometry and shape.5,56,57 We propose that the correlated DNA dimerization and the silver agglomeration
underlie the violet to near-infrared optical switching. We are using
three models to understand organization and electronic structure of
the near-infrared cluster: the two original clusters could remain
chemically intact but electronically coupled, they could linearly
reorganize along the DNA strand, or the two clusters could agglomerate
into a larger cluster.18,20,28 The first two cases suggest strong nucleobase–silver interactions,
while the latter case implies strong silver–silver interactions.
We are addressing these possibilities by identifying cluster binding
sites within the S1-S1 dimer.

Conclusion
Silver clusters are encapsulated
by DNA strands and form optical
reporters for oligonucleotide analytes. We studied DNA reorganization
that accompanies analyte recognition and the concerted cluster transformation.
A single-stranded oligonucleotide coalesces around an ∼11 silver
atom cluster. Complementary DNA strands hybridize with this precursor
sensor and transform the violet cluster with weak emission to a near-infrared
cluster with strong emission. Intermolecular and intramolecular variants
show that the near-infrared cluster coordinates two DNA strands with
antiparallel orientations. In conjunction with the strand dimerization,
the net silver stoichiometry doubles. Understanding this relationship
between silver stoichiometry and DNA organization will advance development
of DNA-bound silver cluster chromophores.
