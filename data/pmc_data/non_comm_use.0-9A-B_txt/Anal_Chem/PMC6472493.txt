Hepatocytes help
to maintain glucose homeostasis in response to
a variety of signals, including pancreatic hormones such as insulin.
Insulin is released from the pancreas with variable dynamics, yet
the role that these play in regulating glucose metabolism in the liver
is still unclear. In this study, a modular microfluidic system was
developed to quantitatively measure the effect of insulin dynamics
on glucose consumption by a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, HepG2.
A microfluidic bioreactor that contained 106 HepG2 cells
was cultured for up to 10 days in an incubator. For glucose consumption
experiments, the bioreactor was removed from the incubator and connected
with reagents for an enzymatic glucose assay. The mixed components
were then delivered into a droplet-based microfluidic system where
the intensity of the fluorescent product of the enzyme assay was used
to quantify the glucose concentration. By optimizing the mixing time
of the reagents, the dynamic range of the enzymatic assay was adjusted
to 0–12 mM glucose and had a time resolution of 96 ± 12
s. The system was used to observe rapid changes in insulin-induced
glucose consumption from HepG2 cells. This assay format is versatile
and can be expanded to measure a variety of hepatic metabolites, such
as lactate, pyruvate, or ketone bodies, which will enable the correlation
of pancreatic hormone dynamics to liver metabolism.

==== Body
Worldwide,
425 million people
have diabetes, with numbers continuing to increase every year.1 Of those individuals, 90% have type II diabetes,
which is a result of defective insulin secretion from the pancreas
and insulin resistance in peripheral tissues, ultimately leading to
abnormal glucose levels in the blood. The pancreas and liver are two
organs that help maintain euglycemia. When blood glucose levels are
too high or too low, the pancreas releases insulin and glucagon to
stimulate anabolic and catabolic processes, respectively, in the liver
and other organs. This interorgan signaling is essential for maintaining
blood glucose levels around 5 mM.

Hepatocytes make up 70–85%
of the liver, and help control
glucose levels by converting excess glucose to glycogen for storage
(glycogenesis), breaking down glycogen to replenish glucose levels
(glycogenolysis), generating glucose via precursors (gluconeogenesis),
and converting lactate to glucose in the Cori cycle.2 Appropriate metabolic flux through these pathways is necessary
to maintain homeostasis, and its disruption can have detrimental effects
on overall glucose metabolism.

While the effects of insulin
and glucagon on whole body glucose
levels have been known for decades, how the dynamic release profiles
of these peptides consisting of rapid changes in their levels, including
oscillations with periods from 3 to 15 min, affects hepatic metabolism
has only been sparsely investigated. To investigate these effects,
it would be ideal to have an in vitro system that enables automated
perfusion of pancreatic hormones to hepatocytes coupled with real-time
detection of metabolic output. The use of in vitro hepatocyte systems
for toxicology, pharmacology, and metabolism studies have become popular
recently as they allow a mimic of the microstructure, properties,
and metabolic functions of the liver.3−16 There are several examples of hepatocyte-filled microfluidic devices
that have incorporated sensors for measuring various components of
metabolism and function during long-term culture. Some examples of
monitored analytes include oxygen,4 albumin
and transferrin release,5 and glucose uptake
and lactate production.6 However, these
measurements have not been applied to examine the effects of pancreatic
hormone dynamics.

In this work, we developed a microfluidic
bioreactor for optimizing
growth and maintaining structure and function of HepG2, a human hepatocarcinoma
cell line. This microfluidic bioreactor successfully enabled culture
of HepG2 for up to 10 days in a cell culture incubator. When desired,
the device could be removed and the extracellular output from the
bioreactor combined with enzymatic glucose reagents. The combined
solutions were encapsulated into a droplet-based microfluidic system
and the intensity of the resulting fluorescent assay product in the
droplets was measured. The incubation time of the assay was optimized
for measurement of glucose from 0–12 mM, the typical range
of extracellular glucose concentrations. This system allowed the effect
of insulin on glucose consumption in the HepG2 cells to be observed
and quantified online and in near real-time. Additionally, the perfusion
and detection systems are versatile and can be expanded to deliver
various dynamic hormone perfusion profiles and measure a variety of
different metabolic products using different assay reagents.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals and Reagents
Cosmic calf serum (CCS) was
obtained from Hyclone Laboratories (South Logan, UT). Gentamicin was
from Lonza (Wakersville, MD). The 100× antibiotic–antimycotic
(Ab/Am) and TrypLE were from Life Technologies (Gaithersburg, MD).
Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) and Leibovitz’s
L-15 medium were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) (Manassas, VA). Matrigel and mineral oil were obtained from
VWR International (Radnor, PA). Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) prepolymer
(Sylgard 184) was from Dow Corning (Midland, MI). All solutions were
prepared using ultrapure DI water (NANOpure Diamond System, Barnstead
International, Dubuque, IA) and filtered using 0.2 μm nylon
syringe filters (Pall Corporation, Port Washington, NY). All other
reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) unless
stated otherwise.

Microfluidic Bioreactor Fabrication
The microfluidic
bioreactor was based on a previous design7 and fabricated using conventional soft lithography from PDMS at
a 10:1 ratio of base to curing agent. The design contained two layers;
all channels and structures in both layers were 100 μm in height
and the dimensions were verified using a portable surface roughness
tester (SJ-310 Series, Mitutoyo, Aurora, IL). The access holes were
fabricated using a titanium nitride hole punch (SYNEO, Angleton, TX)
and were 1.65 mm in diameter.

HepG2 Culture and Characterization
The human hepatocarcinoma
cell line, HepG2, was obtained from ATCC and cultured in T25 or T75
flasks in EMEM supplemented with 10% CCS, 1% Ab/Am, and 0.1% gentamicin.

To perform growth curve measurements, five PDMS bioreactors were
precoated with 60 μL of 3 mg mL–1 Matrigel
for 1 h followed by a rinse with serum-free EMEM. After coating, 60
μL of HepG2 cells (1.6 × 103 μL–1) were loaded into the bioreactor and incubated at 37 °C with
5% CO2 for 24 h. A syringe pump was then used to deliver
supplemented EMEM at a flow rate of 5 μL min–1 over 10 days with the outlet of the device connected to Tygon tubing
(0.02” ID × 0.060” OD, Cole-Parmer North America,
Vernon Hills, IL) and directed to a waste vial. Every other day, one
bioreactor was removed from the incubator and TrypLE was added to
the device and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C to detach the HepG2
cells. The released cells were counted and assessed for viability
with a Cedex HiRes Analyzer (Roche Custom Biotech, Indianapolis, IN).
To determine the metabolic activity of HepG2 cells cultured in the
device, 100 μL of extracellular output was sampled daily and
stored in a −80 °C freezer until analysis. The amounts
of albumin (BioVision, Milpitas, CA) and urea (Cayman Chemical, Ann
Arbor MI) in the samples were determined using standard kits. To compare
growth and function in the bioreactors to 2D cultures, HepG2 were
cultured for 10 days in T25 flasks with extracellular samples collected
every day for similar assays. Growth curves and measurements of albumin
and urea were conducted in triplicate.

Automated Perfusion
To ensure consistent numbers of
cells for online glucose measurements, cell cultures from T75 flasks
were diluted with an appropriate volume of supplemented EMEM to 1.6
× 104 HepG2 μL–1, and 60 μL
were added to each bioreactor. These cells were incubated overnight
with no flow to allow the cells to attach. The bioreactor was then
attached to an automated pressure-driven flow system (OB1Mk3, Elveflow,
Paris, France) for perfusion with glucose and insulin. Two different
solutions could be delivered to the bioreactor; the solutions were
composed of Leibovitz’s L-15 Media, which was supplemented
with the concentrations of glucose or insulin given in the text. The
total flow rate to the bioreactor was maintained at 5 μL min–1, while the flow rates from the two input solutions
were adjusted to achieve the desired concentration of glucose or insulin.
The flow rates were monitored using inline flow sensors (MFS3, Elveflow).

The bioreactor was placed on a custom rectangular copper plate
that had four Peltier devices (20.0 × 40.0 × 4.3 mm, Custom
Thermoelectric, Bishopville, MD) on each side of the plate. The temperature
of the copper plate was controlled using an Accuthermo FTC-100D controller
(Freemont, CA) in conjunction with a J-type thermocouple (SA1-J, Omega
Engineering Inc., Samford, CT) attached to the center of the copper
block. The temperature of the plate was adjusted so that the temperature
inside the bioreactor was 37 °C as measured using a flexible
wire microthermocouple (IT-18, Physitemp Instruments, Inc., Clifton,
NJ). The entire setup consisting of the microfluidic device, copper
plate, thermocouple, and Peltiers were housed in a home-built 3D-printed
holder.

The output of the bioreactor was directed out of the
3D-printed
holder and into a three-way microfluidic connector (P-512, IDEX Health
and Science, Oak Harbor, WA) via Tygon tubing. The other input to
the three-way connector consisted of a solution containing the glucose
assay reagents, made up of 1.9 mL of a 50 mM phosphate buffered solution
(pH 7.4), 0.04 mL of 10 U mL–1 horseradish peroxidase
(HRP), 0.04 mL of 100 U mL–1 glucose oxidase (GOx),
and 0.02 mL of 10 mM Amplex Red. These reagents were in a third reservoir
with their flow rate (5 μL min–1) also controlled
by the pressure driven flow system with an inline flow sensor. The
output of the three-way connector was delivered via Tygon tubing to
a hydrophobic flow-focusing microfluidic device (190 μm etch
depth, Dolomite Microfluidics, Royston, U.K.) as the dispersed phase.
The continuous phase, mineral oil with 1% Span 80, was delivered to
the flow-focusing droplet device via a syringe pump at a flow rate
of 15 μL min–1.

Following each experiment,
bioreactors were removed from the experimental
setup, returned to the incubator, and reconnected to syringes via
Tygon tubing, where hepatocytes were continuously perfused with fresh
media.

Optical Detection System
The droplet junction device
was placed on the stage of a Nikon Eclipse Ti–S inverted microscope
(Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY). For imaging the fluorescence
in droplets, a Xenon arc lamp (Lambda XL, Sutter Instruments, Novato,
CA) with a 535 ± 15 nm excitation filter was used as the excitation
source and made incident on a 565 nm dichroic mirror (Omega Optical,
Inc., Brattleboro, VT). The excitation light was focused into the
droplet microfluidic device using a 2×, 0.06 NA objective (Nikon
Instruments, Inc.). Emission light was collected with the same objective,
passed through the dichroic filter, a 595 ± 30 nm emission filter
(Omega Optical), and detected with a CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson,
AZ). Fluorescence images were acquired with a 42 ms exposure every
5 s. The timing of the images and the lamp shutter were controlled
by Nikon NIS Elements software (Nikon Instruments, Inc.). With the
estimated rate of droplet production, the image captured with a 42
ms exposure consisted of ∼18 droplets. The average fluorescence
intensity of the image was measured using a region of interest set
in the Nikon NIS Elements software.

Modeling of Fluid Dynamics
The velocity, pressure,
and shear stress in the bioreactor were modeled using COMSOL Multiphysics
5.3 (COMSOL, Inc., Burlington, MA). Simulation parameters assumed
water was flowing through the device using an inlet velocity of 0.00014
m s–1 and an inlet concentration of 1 mol m–3, at room temperature. Laminar flow and transport
in dilute species were considered in the physics of the model with
zero velocity (no-slip condition) and zero flux at the walls.

Data Analysis
Unless otherwise noted, all figures are
shown with the timing of the extracellular glucose delivery in red
bars above the traces and timing of insulin delivery with blue bars.
Results are presented as averages with error bars corresponding to
±1 standard error of the mean (SEM) or standard deviation (SD)
as noted in the text. All statistical analyses were performed using
unpaired 1-tailed t tests.

Results and Discussion
In this work, we demonstrate an optical detection system for online
measurement of rapid changes in glucose output from HepG2 in response
to pancreatic hormone perfusion. With this system, the HepG2 could
be cultured for up to 10 days in a conventional incubator in one microfluidic
system and, when desired, connected to a separate microfluidic system
for determination of extracellular glucose levels. In response to
an increase in insulin, increases in glucose consumption were observed
that reduced the extracellular glucose level that was measured.

Microfluidic
System for Culturing HepG2
The bottom
layer of the microfluidic bioreactor contained a 1 cm2 area
with 100 μm tall pillars and structures to facilitate growth
of HepG2 cells in three dimensions. To minimize shear stress on the
cells, the ceiling of the cell culture area was extended 100 μm
above the pillars. The design of the bioreactor is provided in more
detail in the Supporting Information (SI), including Figure S-1. To characterize
the flow in the device, a finite element simulation was used to visualize
the pressure and velocity profiles without cells when the input flow
rate was set at 5 μL min–1 (Figure S-2A–C). As expected, the pressure decreased
linearly across the device and the highest linear velocities were
found at the inlet and outlet. However, the velocity in the cell region
was substantially lower due to the larger cross-sectional area of
this region. This design reduced the calculated shear stress to <10
mPa in the cell culture area (Figure S-2D,E), lower than other devices that have been used for maintaining HepG2
in culture.8−11

Once the design was fixed, HepG2 cells were loaded into the
device and cultured in flowing media in a CO2 incubator
for up to 10 days. The cells in the bioreactor showed higher albumin
and urea release compared to 2D cultures, growth curves that exhibited
all phases of cell growth, and >90% viability for over a week (Figure S-3). These results parallel other reports
of HepG2 cell systems in 3D culture.12−16

Incorporation of Online Glucose Assay
For determination
of extracellular glucose levels, the bioreactor was removed from the
incubator and attached to glucose assay reagents and a droplet generating
microfluidic system, as shown in Figure 1A. Two solutions containing 0 mM glucose,
and either 10 mM glucose or 10 mM glucose with 200 nM insulin were
input into the bioreactor using a pressure-driven flow system. The
flow rate into the bioreactor was held constant at 5 μL min–1, but the individual flow rates of the perfusion solutions
were varied to produce different concentrations of the reagents. This
was achieved by programming the perfusion system to modify the flow
rate of the two input solutions independently. An example of the individual
flow rate profiles of all solutions can be seen in Figure S-4. In addition, more complicated profiles could be
produced by switching out the idle reservoir during the experiment,
while flow was being delivered from the active reservoir. In this
way, concentrations of glucose, insulin, and combinations of the two
reagents could be varied in time as dictated by the experiment, while
the total flow rate of the solution to the bioreactor remained constant.
All flow control occurred upstream of the detection system and, therefore,
did not influence the analysis of the extracellular glucose level.

Figure 1 Setup
for automated perfusion of HepG2 with online glucose monitoring.
(A) A pressure-driven flow system was used to deliver media containing
different concentrations of glucose and insulin to the input of the
bioreactor. Flow sensors (F.S.) were used to maintain accurate flow
rates of the reagents. The output of the bioreactor mixed with enzymatic
glucose assay reagents for 54 s before entering a flow-focusing device
that generated droplets. (B) A zoomed-in region is shown from three
fluorescence images of the channel containing the droplets during
a 42 ms exposure. From left to right, the final glucose concentration
was 2.4, 7.2, and 12 mM. The scale bar is 390 μm.

The perfusate exited the bioreactor and mixed 1:1
with the reagents
for measurement of extracellular glucose. These reagents consisted
of a commercially available coupled enzymatic assay using GOx, HRP,
and Amplex Red.17 Amplex Red based assays
have been successfully incorporated into the output of other cell-based
microfluidic devices. For example, assays for glycerol and fatty acid
production from adipocytes were made online with limits of detection
in the low micromolar regime.18,19 The biggest challenge
for incorporation of this commercial assay into our online system
was signal saturation due to the high concentrations of glucose that
were being perfused in the bioreactor (0–12 mM) compared to
the concentrations that were intended for the assay (0–100
μM). To enable detection of these higher glucose concentrations,
the resorufin fluorescence was measured shortly after mixing the enzymatic
reagents with the bioreactor perfusate. Using the recommended ratio
of reagents, they were delivered at a 1:1 flow rate ratio with the
bioreactor output into a mixing tee and then delivered to a flow-focusing
device as the dispersed phase. The length of the tubing from the mixing
tee into the flow-focusing device was chosen such that there would
be just enough time to fully mix the perfusate with the glucose assay
reagents (calculated travel time of 54 s vs a calculated mixing time
of 49 s), ensuring a homogeneous solution entered the flow-focusing
device, but without excessive incubation.

Detection in the droplets
was made 5 mm downstream of the droplet
production intersection, which only allowed ∼684 ms for mixing
within the droplets. This total mixing time of less than 55 s was
well below the recommended 30 min incubation time for the lower concentrations
of glucose and allowed the use of extracellular glucose concentrations
from 0–12 mM.

The droplets were imaged every 5 s using
a 2× objective and
a CCD camera for detection with a 42 ms exposure. As can be seen in Figure 1B, at this exposure
time and droplet production rate, the individual droplets could not
be resolved. Nevertheless, using regions of interest to define the
background and the entire length of the droplet channel, the background-subtracted
fluorescence from each image was calculated and recorded, resulting
in a data point every 5 s. We estimate that the fluorescence was measured
from 18 droplets during the 42 ms exposure (see SI and Figure S5 for information on this estimate). The droplet
size was measured to be 288 ± 7 μm (average ± SD, n = 51 droplets).

An example from a calibration of
the glucose measurement is shown
in Figure 2 where glucose
levels were changed in time and delivered through an unfilled bioreactor
into the glucose detection system. The glucose levels that were delivered
to the bioreactor are shown by the red line and correspond to the
right y-axis, while the background-subtracted fluorescence
intensities of the droplets, as described above, are shown by the
black data points and corresponds to the left y-axis.
The intensities during the middle 5 min (n = ∼60
data points) at each glucose concentration were averaged and are shown
by the open gray circles and the error bars shown are ±1 SD.
A linear response of the average resorufin fluorescence to the glucose
concentration was observed (y = 255x + 66, r2 = 0.99). The calculated limit
of quantitation and limit of detection were 0.7 and 0.2 mM, respectively.
The response time measured across each of the calibration solutions,
a zoomed in portion of which is shown in the inset of Figure 2, was 96 ± 12 s (average
± SD, n = 9 measurements), indicating that rapid
changes in extracellular glucose could be measured.

Figure 2 Online glucose assay
calibration. The calibration of resorufin
fluorescence to glucose concentrations from 0–12 mM is shown.
The black data points are the background-subtracted resorufin intensity
values taken every 5 s from 18 droplets and correspond to the left y-axis. The red line represents the known glucose concentration
that was delivered to the perfusion system. The average resorufin
intensity at each glucose plateau is shown by the open gray circles
with ±1 SD shown by the error bars. The inset is a zoomed-in
portion of the shaded region highlighting the response time from one
calibration solution.

To ensure that the assay was not influenced by extracellular
insulin,
an unfilled chip was perfused with 12 mM glucose for 30 min, followed
by 12 mM glucose with 200 nM insulin. This alternating perfusion with
insulin was repeated at 6 and 0 mM glucose and the data and calibration
is shown in Figure S-6. No difference in
resorufin fluorescence was observed in the presence of insulin. Daily
calibration curves were obtained at three glucose levels.

Application
of Insulin Perfusion to HepG2
To determine
if the newly developed assay could be used for in vitro measurements,
initial experiments were designed to measure the glucose consumption
rates in the absence and presence of insulin. To perform these assays,
the bioreactor was taken out of the CO2 incubator, coupled
with the glucose assay reagents, and connected to the droplet-generating
device for measurement of extracellular glucose levels. Following
connection, the bioreactor was perfused at 0 mM glucose to deplete
extracellular glucose and glycogen stores. This time is seen in Figure 3A by the initial
decrease in measured glucose to <1 mM. After 30 min, hepatocytes
were given a combination of 200 nM insulin in 10 mM glucose, which
resulted in the increase in measured glucose that can be readily seen
in Figure 3A. The glucose
level during this experiment was 7.9 ± 0.3 mM (average ±
SD, n = 359 data points). This experiment was repeated
an additional three times with separate devices, resulting in a glucose
output during the delivery of glucose and insulin of 8.3 ± 0.5
mM (average ± SEM, n = 4 trials). The traces
from the three additional experiments are shown in Figure S-7 and Table S-1 details
the average glucose level for all experiments. This average glucose
level resulted in a calculated consumption rate of 37 μg glucose
h–1 106 cells–1, which
is similar to other rates reported for HepG2 cells.6,20

Figure 3 Glucose
output following perfusion with and without 200 nM insulin.
(A) Approximately 106 HepG2 were perfused with 0 mM glucose
followed by 10 mM glucose with 200 nM insulin. (B) In this experiment,
∼106 HepG2 were initially perfused with 0 mM glucose
followed by 10 mM glucose only. (C) The average measured glucose concentration
from eight perfusion experiments, four with 10 mM glucose with (+Ins)
and four without (−Ins) 200 nM insulin. Error bars correspond
to ±1 SEM from the four trials. The p-value
corresponds to an unpaired one-tailed t test. (D)
Four bioreactors filled with ∼106 HepG2 were perfused
with 10 mM glucose for 45 min. After this time, one of the bioreactors
continued to be perfused with 10 mM glucose (circles), while the others
were perfused with 10 mM glucose with 100 nM insulin. The measured
glucose level at each time point for the four bioreactors are shown.
For this experiment, the glucose concentration was measured using
a standard glucose meter every 5 min.

Control experiments were performed by delivering 0 mM glucose
media
to four bioreactors containing a similar number of cells as that described
above, followed by perfusion with 10 mM glucose without insulin. A
representative trace is shown in Figure 3B, which showed a glucose level of 9.9 ±
0.3 mM (average ± SD, n = 360 points). The glucose
output from the four control experiments during the delivery of glucose
was 10.1 ± 0.1 mM (average ± SEM, n = 4
trials). The traces from the three additional control experiments
are shown in Figure S-8 and detailed in Table S-1. Since the measured extracellular glucose
level was similar to that being delivered, a glucose consumption rate
could not be calculated in the absence of insulin.

As seen in Figures S-7 and S-8, there
was some variability in the timing of reagent delivery between experiments
that were due to small particulates or bubbles introduced from one
of the solution reservoirs (seen as a rapid increase in pressure in
the flow system). When this occurred, the tubing would be disconnected
to clear it out and resulted in slight differences in the times glucose
or insulin was delivered. These clogs typically occurred when new
reservoirs were attached, therefore, flow to the bioreactor did not
have to be stopped during purging. This timing variability does not
allow for the data traces to be overlapped to show an average trace;
however, one of the benefits of the system is the observation of the
glucose changes in real time regardless of the timings. Also, the
glucose consumption values reported are normalized to the time that
the insulin was delivered.

Nevertheless, the average glucose
level that was measured during
insulin delivery in four experiments was lower than the average glucose
level that was measured without insulin (p = 0.0045,
unpaired one-tailed t test, Figure 3C).

To compare these online experiments
to more conventional methods
of glucose measurement, a hand-held glucose meter was used to measure
glucose efflux from the bioreactor. Hepatocytes in four bioreactors
were perfused with 10 mM glucose for 45 min. After this period, three
of the bioreactors were perfused with 10 mM glucose with 100 nM insulin
and one bioreactor continued receiving only 10 mM glucose. Measurements
of glucose output were taken every 5 min with a hand-held glucose
meter (Freestyle Lite, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). Similar
to the online glucose assay, there was a decrease in the measured
glucose concentration in the three bioreactors after the addition
of insulin. The glucose level during the insulin delivery at each
time point from the three bioreactors are shown by the different symbols
in Figure 3D. The glucose
level across all time points during insulin delivery was 8.9 ±
0.1 mM (average ± SEM, n = 3 trials), while
the glucose concentration during the same time points from the control
bioreactor was 9.9 ± 0.2 mM (average ± SD, n = 15 data points; Figure 3D, circles). The similar results obtained using a conventional
method of glucose measurement gave us confidence that the online system
was working as intended and could be used for examining rapid changes
in the glucose levels.

Rapid Changes in Glucose Levels
To examine dynamic
changes in glucose levels, another set of experiments was performed
where insulin was added in the middle of the glucose perfusion. As
shown in Figure 4A,
perfusion with 0 mM glucose media reduced the measured extracellular
glucose level to ∼0 mM. This was followed by 10 mM glucose
perfusion for 15 min, resulting in a measured extracellular glucose
level close to the expected 10 mM. After this time, 200 nM insulin
in 10 mM glucose was delivered for 20 min, producing an abrupt decrease
in the extracellular glucose level. This experiment was repeated three
times with all traces shown in Figure S-9 and described in Table S-1. The glucose
level measured during insulin perfusion was 8.7 ± 0.6 mM (average
± SEM, n = 4 trials), significantly lower than
the glucose level during perfusion without insulin, 10.1 mM ±
0.1 (average ± SEM, n = 4 trials, p = 0.023, unpaired one-tailed t test).

Figure 4 Rapid changes
in glucose consumption. (A) Glycogen was depleted
from HepG2 by initial perfusion with 0 mM glucose. The extracellular
glucose was then increased to 10 mM for 35 min with insulin delivered
during the last 20 min. Glucose was then decreased to 0 mM until the
end of the experiment. (B) The measured extracellular glucose concentration
is shown for HepG2 perfused with an initial 0 mM glucose followed
by 200 nM insulin in 10 mM glucose. Insulin was then removed, and
10 mM glucose was delivered without insulin for 15 min followed by
perfusion with 0 mM glucose to the end of the experiment.

To ensure the effects we observed were not due
to an experimental
artifact, another set of experiments was performed where insulin was
removed during high glucose perfusion. In these experiments, two bioreactors
were first perfused with 0 mM glucose for 50 min, followed by perfusion
with 200 nM insulin in 10 mM glucose, with one of the experiments
shown in Figure 4B.
The glucose level during perfusion was 8.9 ± 0.7 mM (average
± SEM, n = 2 trials, Table S-1). After this time, the perfusion was changed to 10 mM glucose
without insulin, which resulted in an increase in the measured glucose
output (10.0 ± 0.3 mM, average ± SEM, n = 2 trials). While the measured glucose levels during perfusion
with and without insulin in these experiments were not significantly
different (p = 0.089), the small number of replicates
may have been a factor in the lack of significance.

Conclusion
In this work, a method for online measurement of glucose from cultured
hepatocytes was developed using an optical detection system. The calibration
of millimolar concentrations of glucose using a coupled enzymatic
reaction was made possible by measurement before the reaction went
to completion. Although other in vitro hepatocyte systems have incorporated
methods for measuring various components of metabolism and function
during long-term culture,3−16 the system described here is significant and innovative in that
it is suitable to examine acute and rapid changes of extracellular
glucose, which will enable the effects of dynamic pancreatic hormone
stimulations to be examined. Use of the online system was not only
advantageous for reproducible timing of the glucose measurements,
but the format also allowed the culture of the cells to be performed
under independent conditions. This modular approach to cell culture
and online measurements could be beneficial in coupling other in vitro
devices to one another or to other measurement systems, and it could
be possible to examine the role of shear stress on hepatocyte behavior.
Although glucose was measured in this study, various metabolites involved
in hepatic glucose metabolism such as lactate, pyruvate, or ketone
bodies, can be incorporated into similar online assays. Additionally,
the versatility of the automated perfusion system will allow for more
complicated, in vivo-like hormonal profiles to be delivered to the
cells to test their effect on glucose metabolism directly. This methodology
has the potential to shed light on glucose level management in prediabetes
and type II diabetes, as well as provide insight into proper glucose
regulation within the body. We expect that this system will enable
the observation of hepatocyte dynamics in response to more complicated
pancreatic hormone profiles like those observed in vivo in future
work.
