Integral membrane proteins (IMPs)
are of great biophysical and
clinical interest because of the key role they play in many cellular
processes. Here, a comprehensive top down study of 152 IMPs and 277
soluble proteins from human H1299 cells including 11 087 fragments
obtained from collisionally activated dissociation (CAD), 6452 from
higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD), and 2981 from electron
transfer dissociation (ETD) shows their great utility and complementarity
for the identification and characterization of IMPs. A central finding
is that ETD is ∼2-fold more likely to cleave in soluble regions
than threshold fragmentation methods, whereas the reverse is observed
in transmembrane domains with an observed ∼4-fold bias toward
CAD and HCD. The location of charges just prior to dissociation is
consistent with this directed fragmentation: protons remain localized
on basic residues during ETD but easily mobilize along the backbone
during collisional activation. The fragmentation driven by these protons,
which is most often observed in transmembrane domains, both is of
higher yield and occurs over a greater number of backbone cleavage
sites. Further, while threshold dissociation events in transmembrane
domains are on average 10.1 (CAD) and 9.2 (HCD) residues distant from
the nearest charge site (R, K, H, N-terminus), fragmentation is strongly
influenced by the N- or C-terminal position relative to that site:
the ratio of observed b- to y-fragments is ∼1:3 if the cleavage
occurs >7 residues N-terminal and ∼3:1 if it occurs >7
residues
C-terminal to the nearest basic site. Threshold dissociation products
driven by a mobilized proton appear to be strongly dependent on not
only relative position of a charge site but also N- or C-terminal
directionality of proton movement.

==== Body
Integral
membrane proteins (IMPs)
play a critical part in many cellular processes, including signal
transduction and transport of ions, metabolites, and other proteins
across lipid membranes.1 With functions
that are so central to life, IMPs are important targets of fundamental
and pharmacological study. For example, while IMPs are encoded by
∼25% of all known genes, they comprise a staggering ∼70%
of current drug targets2,3 often occurring in multiple isoforms
and variants arising from alternative splicing and post-translational
modification of specific products of multigene families.4

Despite their essential roles in cell biology,
precise characterization
of whole IMPs remains a challenge for drug developers and proteomicists
alike.5 The hydrophobic nature of IMPs
and their resultant lack of solubility make them difficult to analyze
by traditional bottom up mass spectrometry.6,7 IMP
solubility also challenges the “top down” approach in
which intact proteins are introduced directly to the mass spectrometer.8,9

Initial work from Whitelegge and Faull, with a focus on the
seven-transmembrane
helix protein bacteriorhodopsin, demonstrated the potential of top
down analysis of IMPs.10,11 More recent reports12,13 have reinforced the viability of top down mass spectrometry for
the study of IMPs, including a report by Walker in which sequence
tags were derived from the extensive fragmentation of transmembrane
domains (TMDs) for the identification of 13 integral membrane proteins.14 A much larger top down study of 83 integral
membrane proteins identified from HeLa15 followed Walker’s report and demonstrated that collisionally
activated dissociation (CAD) preferentially fragments in TMDs as compared
to intracellular or extracellular regions. In general, a greater density
of gas-phase fragmentation within the TMDs enables IMPs to be identified,
on average, with more confidence than soluble or membrane-associated
proteins.

However, the observation of these broad trends has
provided little
aid in the accurate prediction of the exact sites and relative intensities
of peptide fragment ions, largely due to the myriad complicating chemical
and physical factors.16,17 Much of the theory behind CAD
is based on the “mobile proton model” (MPM), which posits
that protons drive fragmentation and are free to translate along the
peptide’s polyamide backbone prior to cleavage.18 The MPM, developed by observing the fragmentation
of peptide ions, provides a framework for understanding the chemistry
of vibrational dissociation in “bottom up” studies.

On the other hand, in-depth studies of CAD fragmentation of the
whole protein ions used in top down studies19 have only examined selected standard proteins (myoglobin, ubiquitin,
etc.). Although proteins and peptides might, at first, seem analogous,
the increased number of charges, heterogeneity of charge site isomers,
and potential diversity of higher-order structures can exert significant
effects on bond cleavage that are not well understood. The differences
in fragmentation between peptides and proteins also extend to electron-based
dissociation modalities. As early as 1999, differences between the
fragmentation of phosphoproteins compared to phosphopeptides were
recognized.20 To the authors’ knowledge,
studies of the fragmentation of intact proteins have never been extended
to a similar scale of those performed on 2+ and 3+ peptide ions in
comprehensive bottom up studies.21,22 Large-scale
trends of peptide dissociation from different fragmentation methods
have also been reported.23−25

While CAD fragmentation
occurs by increasing the internal energy
of peptide/protein ions until bond cleavage occurs, electron-based
fragmentation, such as electron capture dissociation (ECD)26 or electron transfer dissociation (ETD),27 generally breaks bonds near the location of
electron capture or transfer at a protonated site, respectively.28−31 Amazingly, noncovalent bonds from the tertiary structure or bound
ligands can be conserved, despite backbone bonds being broken.32 Often attributed to the process being nonergodic,
this effect has been used to study gas-phase protein secondary, tertiary,
and even quaternary structure.33−37

A recent study by Breuker et al. has shown that the polar
helices
in the three helix bundle protein KIX are maintained after transfer
to the gas-phase, due to the extensive stabilization resulting from
salt bridges between basic and acidic residues.38 On the other hand, TMDs generally do not contain these
polar residues; survival of their higher-order structures during and
after transfer to the gas phase is not guaranteed.

Here, a top
down study of 429 proteins, including 152 IMPs from
human H1299 cells using 11 087 CAD (RF-style) fragments, 6452
higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD, beam style) fragments,
and 2981 ETD fragments, illustrates the great complementarity between
the three methods for identifying and characterizing whole membrane
proteins. Given these data, we further investigated bond cleavage
patterns with respect to the membrane character of the precursor,
the domain from which each cleavage occurs, the local membrane character
of each fragment ion, and the effects of proximity of the cleavage
to a basic residue (R, K, H, N-terminus).

Experimental Section
Data Collection
Enriched mitochondrial samples were
prepared from H1299 cell lines as described previously.39 The resulting samples were separated using the
GELFREE 8100 fractionation system (Expedeon, Cambridgeshire, United
Kingdom) utilizing 10% T gel columns. The first five fractions, below
30 kDa, were collected for analysis. Following methanol/chloroform/water
precipitation to remove SDS, the fractions were resuspended using
20–30 μL of buffer A (95% water, 5% acetonitrile, 0.2%
formic acid).

The fractions were then analyzed with denaturing
LC-MS using PLRP-S nanocapillary columns on an Orbitrap Elite instrument
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) as described previously.39 All fragmentation was performed using a top-two data dependent
method and 15 m/z isolation windows.
CAD was performed using a q of 0.4, a normalized
collision energy of 41, and 100 ms activation time. A 5 ms reaction
time was utilized for ETD, and a 20 normalized collision energy was
used for HCD. CAD data was acquired from two sets of GELFREE fractions,
with one set analyzed in duplicate (16 total LC-MS injections). ETD
and HCD data were each acquired from a single GELFrEE analysis (six
and five LC-MS injections, respectively).

Data Analysis
Intact precursor and fragment masses
from LC-MS/MS files were determined using the in-house software cRAWler,
which utilizes Xtract to determine monoisotopic neutral masses from
high-resolution precursor and fragment ion spectra. Processed data
were further analyzed with a distributed version of ProSightPC 3.0
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a 168-core computing cluster using iterative
absolute mass search logic with an initial 2.3 Da MS1 precursor tolerance
followed by 2000, 20 000, and 100 000 Da windows. If
a precursor mass could not be automatically determined, the entire
database was searched. Fragment ions were matched using a 10 ppm mass
tolerance.

All searches were performed against only “reviewed”
entries from the March 2013 release of UniProtKB (2013_03), including
20 248 gene products. Searches with smaller precursor mass
windows (2.3 or 2000 Da) were run against a highly annotated (26)
PTM Warehouse (21 624 023 theoretical proteoforms),
while searches with wider intact tolerance windows utilized a warehouse
containing 164 088 proteoforms. The databases are available
for download from ftp://prosightftp:gsX1gON@prosightpc.northwestern.edu. Residue-specific transmembrane domain prediction was accomplished
using TMHMM v.2.0,40,41 based upon the precise sequence
identified by ProSightPC.

A C# program was developed in-house
to retrieve the TMHMM scores
for each residue N-terminal to the cleavage site of a matching fragment
ion; the overall TMHMM score was determined by averaging all such
individual TMHMM scores across the entire protein. The same program
was also used to find the closest basic residue to each cleavage site.
Fragments with no reported m/z value
or charge were not included.

Results and Discussion
Sequence coverage maps derived from consecutive ETD and CAD fragmentation
scans are shown in Figure 1 for three representative
proteins. For these three integral membrane proteins, their predicted
TMDs are boxed in orange and their observed c, z· and b, y ions obtained
from ETD and CAD, respectively, are indicated in standard fashion.
Subunit 7b of cytochrome c oxidase exhibits CAD products
from 21 of the 24 available sites within its single TMD, with only
5 of the 22 non-TMD sites cleaved (Figure 1a). Conversely, ETD of the same protein cleaves mostly in the soluble
region, where the few products that do originate from the TMDs are
only found on the N-terminal boundary near a lysine residue. Interestingly,
only five cleavage sites are conserved between the two methods. Two
other IMPs, ATP synthase subunit f (Figure 1b) and protein transport protein sec61 beta (Figure 1c), also exhibit high CAD and low ETD coverage in TMDs. The
latter contains a phosphorylation at Ser16, which is indicated in
pink and survives both fragmentation processes. ETD fragmentation
in the soluble regions improves localization of this modification
from a 56 to a nine-amino acid region (Figure 1c).

Figure 1 Fragmentation observed from three integral membrane proteins shows
cleavage sites for CAD and ETD fragmentation with respect to TMHMM-predicted
transmembrane helical regions (orange boxes). The utility of these
techniques for localizing a post-translational modification is show
in (c), with the phosphorylated serine residue highlighted in pink.

An extension of this analysis
to all confidently identified proteins
(E value <10–4) is shown in
Figure 2a, where the average TMHMM score of
the intact protein (computed as the average TMHMM score of every residue
in the protein sequence40) is plotted with
respect to the average TMHMM score of the observed matched fragment
ions from that precursor. Each symbol represents one protein identified
by either CAD (350 blue squares, 16 LC-MS injections), HCD (333 green
diamonds, 5 LC-MS injections), or ETD (156 red circles, 6 LC-MS injections),
where the size of the symbol is proportional to the number of matched
fragment ions found from that protein. Soluble proteins lie at or
near (0,0), as they have no predicted TMDs, while a hypothetical protein
comprised entirely of TMDs will have both an average and matched fragment
score of 1 and appear at (1,1). Random fragmentation should result
in product ions that have on average the same TMHMM score as that
of the entire protein, which is illustrated by the y = x line in Figure 2a. Clustering
of CAD and HCD results above the line indicates that these proteins
are preferentially fragmented within TMDs, as was predicted from previous
studies of CAD in TMDs.15 For proteins
identified multiple times during the three CAD runs, the minimum and
maximum average TMHMM score from their matched fragments are shown
in Figure S1, Supporting Information. Overall,
a smaller number of proteins with predicted TMDs were identified in
the ETD data set than for either of the collisionally activated methods.
IMPs that were identified by ETD generally clustered below the line,
corresponding to a higher cleavage propensity in soluble regions.

equal numbers of fragment ions in soluble versus transmembrane domains
would fall. The legends display symbols for each dissociation method
evaluated (CAD, HCD, and ETD), with symbol size proportional to the
total number of matching fragment ions for that protein. (a) Each
symbol indicates a protein, with the x-value determined
by its overall average TMHMM score and the y-value
by the average TMHMM score of its matched fragment ions. (b) A pairwise
comparison of proteins plotting their average TMHMM scores for those
fragmented using ETD (x-axis) and either CAD or HCD
(y-axis); symbol size was drawn using data from the
fragmentation method yielding the lowest number of matching fragment
ions for that protein.

Due to the previously mentioned disparities in the proteins
identified
by the different fragmentation techniques, it is necessary to directly
compare their cleavage propensities from the same protein. For the
proteins identified by both ETD and collisional dissociation (CAD
or HCD), a pairwise comparison of 391 proteins is shown (Figure 2b) of the average TMHMM score of ETD fragments with
respect to that from CAD fragments (blue squares) and/or HCD fragments
(green diamonds). The direct comparison between methods shows an identical
trend: HCD and CAD are more likely to cleave in TMDs than ETD. IMP
classes not represented here, due to the enriched mitochondrial preparation,
include G-protein coupled receptors and other plasma membrane IMPs
that may show different behavior, but the strong trends from Figure 2 indicate that this phenomenon is general. The analysis
reflects the trends from high-throughput, data-dependent top down
studies.42 We did not systematically study
the effect of IMP precursor charge state on fragmentation in this
report, which has been shown to significantly affect cleavage propensities
in soluble proteins.

Whereas residues with high TMHMM scores
(∼0.8–1)
are almost certainly contained within a TMD, those with intermediate
scores (∼0.1–0.7) often lie on the boundaries between
membrane-spanning and soluble regions.41 Binning the TMHMM score of observed matching fragment ions and normalizing
these against a random set (defined as all possible fragments from
all proteins in the data set) shows the regions with the greatest
increases or decreases in fragmentation (Figure 3). For example, 4627 HCD fragments were observed with scores between
0 and 0.1, while 40 541 cleavage sites (corresponding to 81 082
fragments) were possible with those same scores from all of the proteins
identified in the HCD data set, resulting in a 5.7% cleavage propensity
for soluble regions. The majority of increased CAD and HCD fragmentation
comes from regions with scores of 0.9 or higher, where ∼16%
of all possible fragments are observed from both. Conversely, this
is the region of lowest ETD cleavage, with only ∼4% of all
possible fragments observed. Intermediate regions, which account for
fewer fragments, do show some moderate increase in CAD and HCD cleavage
but no obvious decrease in ETD products. Overall, the ratio between
the percent of CAD and ETD products observed changes from 0.6 to 3.7
for regions with TMHMM scores of <0.1 and >0.9, respectively.
For
top down proteomics, this >6-fold preference (3.7/0.6) of fragmentation
type translates to a >10 orders-of-magnitude better certainty for
identification of the proteins identified with both methods (Figure
S2, Supporting Information).

Figure 3 Percentage
of fragments observed for CAD, HCD, and ETD with respect
to the total number of possible fragments from all proteins identified
from each data set binned according to TMHMM score. Scores under 0.1
indicate a soluble protein region, 0.1–0.7 an intermediate,
and 0.7–1 a transmembrane domain.

Clear differences exist between CAD/HCD and ETD cleavage
propensities
across the hundreds of TMDs studied, reflecting a fundamental difference
in fragmentation mechanism. ETD generally avoids cleaving within TMDs,
likely due to their lack of basic residues, which carry the charges
necessary for electron-based cleavages. Whitelegge and co-workers
also found very limited ECD cleavage (only 3 fragments were observed)
in the TMDs of ATP synthase subunit c from Arabidopsis thaliana but were able to increase fragmentation by vibrationally activating
the ions prior to electron-based dissociation.43

ETD fragmentation near TMD boundaries (intermediate
TMHMM scores)
can be attributed to the presence of a basic residue in the neighboring
soluble region. While CAD and HCD also depend on the presence of a
charge, their inherent vibrational activation prior to dissociation
leads to the mobilization of protons across the protein backbone,
allowing for cleavages remote to basic residues.18 In the context of top down proteomics employed at scale,
the excellent TMD sequence coverage offered by CAD and HCD provides
more confident protein identifications but far fewer fragments in
the PTM-rich soluble regions. Complementary ETD fragmentation was
often necessary to better localize these PTMs and fully characterize
the observed proteoform (as in Figure 1c).

Although threshold dissociation techniques mobilize protons prior
to dissociation, current CAD mechanisms require a proton to be localized
to the backbone NH or carbonyl directly proximal to the cleavage site.18 The charge must be present even in the middle
of TMDs where there are few nearby acidic or basic residues. The mobile
proton model would indeed predict a greater heterogeneity of cleavage
sites within TMDs, attributable to elevated charge mobility due to
the relative lack of proton-sequestering basic residues in these domains.44 Delocalization of these protons would result
in a randomization of fragmentation throughout the TMD.14,18 If an individual proton can sample many more sites prior to driving
a cleavage event in a TMD, fragment yields (and therefore fragment
ion abundances) at each of those cleavage sites should exhibit a corresponding
decrease. Figure 4 shows the intensity-weighted TMHMM score of a protein’s matched fragments compared to
the average TMHMM score of the intact protein. Similar to Figure 2a, the HCD and CAD symbols cluster above the y = x line indicating not only that their
cleavage in TMDs results in more fragment ions but also a higher overall
proportion of the total fragment intensity or yield. Again, ETD symbols
are clustered below the line, further indicating their aversion to
fragmenting in TMDs. The increased “density” of fragment
ions from HCD and CAD in TMDs can be explained by examining the original
placement and movement of the protein’s charges prior to dissociation.

Figure 4 Correlation
of the average THMHMM score of the whole protein (x-axis), with the average TMHMM score of matched fragment
ions weighted by their observed intensities in the fragmentation spectra
(y-axis). Proteins with an equal fragment ion yield
from membrane and soluble regions will cluster around the y = x line. The legend displays the symbols
corresponding to each dissociation method evaluated (CAD, HCD, and
ETD), with symbol size proportional to the total number of matching
fragment ions for that protein.

ETD fragmentation in soluble regions provides further evidence
for charge sequestration by basic residues during ESI.45 Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that,
during electrospray ionization, protons in solution are retained by
basic residues, rapidly forming H-bonds with nearby amide NH groups.46 For ECD and ETD, fragmentation occurs where
the electron is captured/transferred before the intramolecular vibrational
redistribution can occur (∼1–100 ps47), which does not allow for intramolecular proton transfer
prior to dissociation. In these cases, the characteristic fragmentation
driven by a given charge is deemed its “charge site spectrum”
and is almost always localized to within ten residues of the charge-carrying
basic side chain.30 Thus, the lower number
of ETD fragments in the TMDs can be directly correlated to the lack
of basic residues in those regions.

On the other hand, the high
density of CAD and HCD fragments in
TMDs provides further evidence that they do not require a nearby basic
residue to fragment. Coulombic repulsion in the densely charged soluble
regions would affect most strongly the charges carried at the border
of the TMDs, mobilizing them into the large stretches of nonpolar
residues (Scheme 1). However, once these charges
are mobilized, they not only are driving cleavage at a greater number
of backbone positions (Figure 2) but also are
on average cleaving more often than their counterparts in soluble
regions (Figure 4). The thermally excited protein
ions undoubtedly have greatly disrupted secondary or tertiary structures
prior to dissociation; favored cleavage in TMDs can instead be attributed
to the movement of the charges themselves. While protons in soluble
regions likely retain interaction with a basic side chain, those that
have been mobilized are bound primarily to the backbone. Therefore,
they can direct cleavage more readily, resulting in a higher overall
fragment yield.

Scheme 1 In order to drive CAD and HCD fragmentation
deep within TMDs, the
protons must first migrate (either through space or across backbone
bonds) from the side chain of a basic residue all the way to the cleavage
site. The average distance from the nearest basic residue (R, K, H,
N-terminus) of the three dissociation techniques is shown in Figure 5a for fragments with increasing TMHMM scores. To
provide a null hypothesis, the average distance between randomized
cleavages (vide supra) and the nearest basic residue
was calculated for all proteins. Across all observed fragments (TMHMM
score ≥0), ETD cleaves 1.2 residues closer than random, while
HCD and CAD cleave 1.5 and 2.9 residues farther away than random,
respectively. At increasing TMHMM score, fragments are farther away
from the nearest basic residues (up to 10.1 for CAD at TMHMM score
≥0.9), which is consistent with the scarcity of basic residues
in these regions. The distance between random and observed fragmentation
is mostly maintained at higher membrane scores, although HCD cleavages
do move closer to random at TMHMM scores approaching 1. Even for fragments
limited to TMHMM scores of 0 (not shown), CAD and HCD cleave, on average
1.4 residues and 0.9 residues farther than random, respectively. Binning
these fragments by TMHMM scores with a bin size of 0.1 and plotting
the differential distance from random (Figure S3, Supporting Information), instead of using a cutoff (Figure 5a), shows that these trends are maintained for regions
of all scores.

Figure 5 The effect of basic residue proximity on fragmentation.
(a) The
average distance of cleavages to the nearest basic residue (R, K,
H, N-terminus) as a function of TMHMM score cutoff for observed fragments
and randomized fragmentation from each data set. (b) Distribution
of observed fragments with respect to proximity to nearest basic residue
for CAD, HCD, and ETD. (c) and (d) Distribution of cleavages for fragments
from CAD and HCD as shown in (b) but for fragments with TMHMM scores
≥0.5 and ≥0.9, respectively. The expected distribution
based upon random fragmentation is also shown for each case.

In Figure 5b,c, cleavage products are binned
by their “relative cleavage site”, which indicates the
distance from the nearest basic residue to the cleavage site. Cleavages
on the N-terminal side of their basic residue are indicated with negative
values and C-terminal cleavages with positive. No zero values exist
because cleavages occur between residues, so fragmentation directly
adjacent to a basic residue would be considered 1 or −1. Fragment
count is normalized so that the area under each curve is 100%. Figure 5b shows this correlation for the number of observed
CAD, HCD, and ETD fragments. As expected, the ETD fragments are clustered
much more closely around the basic residues, following a quasi-Cauchy
distribution. A similar, but slightly broader, distribution is also
found for random fragmentation (not shown). Conversely, CAD and HCD
fragmentation exhibit a much broader distribution, indicating their
propensity to cleave farther away from basic residues. Figure 5c,d shows the same correlation for CAD and HCD with
TMHMM scores of ≥0.5 and ≥0.9, respectively. ETD did
not produce substantial membrane fragments, and so, results were not
included. Random fragmentation from CAD and HCD was computed as the
average of the random from each data set. The two vibrational fragmentation
methods exhibit a bimodal distribution, with HCD consistently closer
to the nearest basic residue than CAD for fragments at TMHMM scores
≥0.5 and ≥0.9. Random fragmentation also shows the same
bimodal distribution, which is consistent with the lack of basic residues
in TMDs, but its lobes are significantly closer to the basic residue
than those from the observed HCD and CAD fragmentation events.

Again, ETD fragmentation occurring consistently ∼1 site
closer to basic residues than random provides further evidence that
the charges driving the cleavages remain on the basic residues during
this process. The few fragments that are observed far away from any
basic residues can be attributed to a through space cleavage process,
where the protonated basic residue is brought closer to the cleavage
site through higher-order protein interactions.48 ETD fragments were very scarce in regions with higher TMHMM
scores and were not included in Figure 5c,d.

Conversely, CAD fragmentation cleaves on average almost three residues
farther away from the nearest basic residue than random. Surprisingly,
the protons driving CAD cleavage are not just delocalized but in fact
mobilized farther away from basic residues than would be predicted
by a random model. The interaction that drives this mobilization is
observed even in the center of TMDs, where cleavage sites are on average
∼10 residues distant from the nearest basic residue. Previous
explanations of nonrandomized fragmentation often invoked salt-bridging
or other interactions between the basic residues and cleavage site.43 However, very few interactions are possible
in the nonpolar regions of an energetically excited protein ion. Indeed,
it is most likely that the Coulombic repulsion between nearby charges
causes the mobilized protons to migrate toward regions with the lowest
charge density: away from basic residues (Scheme 1). HCD fragmentation exhibits cleavages closer to basic residues
than CAD, which is consistent with CAD being a slower heating fragmentation
process that allows protons slightly more time to migrate toward the
center of TMDs prior to cleavage.

Further evidence of the influence
of charge migration on collisional
fragmentation can be found by examining the “y-fragment enhancement
factor,” which is computed as  

First defined by Yates and co-workers to study the effect
of basic
residue location on peptide fragmentation, this factor is a measure
of the relative yield of y-fragments with respect to their complementary
b-fragments.49 A protein with only matching
y-fragments would have an enhancement factor of 1, while one with
all b-fragments would lie at −1. Figure 6 shows the y-enhancement factor of CAD and HCD fragments with respect
to their distance from the nearest basic residue for all fragments
(a) and those with TMHMM scores ≥0.5 (b). However, unlike the
previous study, here, only the number of matched fragment ions are
considered, not their intensities. The horizontal red line in each
represents the average enhancement factor of both CAD and HCD fragments,
which was determined as 0.15 for all fragments and 0.08 for those
with TMHMM scores ≥0.5. The observed nonzero average value
indicates the overall increased stability of y-fragments with respect
to b-fragments during cleavage and can be attributed to the tendency
for b-fragment to further rearrange, forming a-fragments.50

Figure 6 y-fragment enhancement factor plotted with respect to
proximity
to the nearest basic residue (R, K, H, N-terminus) for CAD and HCD
for (a) all fragments and (b) fragments with a TMHMM score ≥0.5.
The horizontal line indicates the average enhancement factor for each
set. Observed b- and y-fragment count used to calculate enhancement
factors is shown in (c) and (d).

Surprisingly, there is also a clear dependence between distance
from and direction to a basic residue and enhancement factor. A cleavage
7 residues on the N-terminal side of the nearest basic residue has
an enhancement factor of ∼0.5 (∼75% chance of a y-fragment),
while a similar cleavage 7 residues C-terminal to the nearest basic
residue has an enhancement factor of about −0.5 (∼25%
chance of a y-fragment). Enhancement approaches the average value
for cleavages adjacent to basic residues, but the increase or decrease
in y-fragment enhancement extends to cleavages >10 residues distant,
including those in TMDs (Figure 6b). The above
results are consistent with the general y-fragment enhancement found
for peptides with C-terminal basic residues49 and provide further evidence of the effect of charge migration on
fragmentation. To rule out detection biases, the same HCD fragments
were plotted (Figure S4, Supporting Information) with respect to distance to the closest of three nonbasic residues
(F, A, D) with similar total natural abundance. Here, the slight trend
can be attributed to the detection biases inherent in the experiment,
which likely include biases toward observation of higher-charged fragment
ions and the effect of the scan range window. However, this trend
is in the opposite direction of that for the basic
residues, indicating that the basic residues are in fact responsible
for the y-fragment enhancement found in Figure 6.

The enhancement factor results above showed that the ratio
of observed
b- to y-fragments is ∼1:3 if the cleavage occurs >7 residues
N-terminal and ∼3:1 if it occurs >7 residues C-terminal
to
the nearest basic site. Apparently, CAD and HCD fragmentation is dependent
on the relative location of the nearest basic residue. For fragments
occurring very near (<3–4 residues) to a basic residue,
the protonated side chain can transfer the charge to backbone positions
both N- and C-terminal to the future cleavage site. Thus, the proton
driving these cleavages can be mobilized from either direction prior
to backbone dissociation, and very little b- or y-fragment enhancement
is observed. On the other hand, cleavages very distant to any basic
residues, such as those found in TMDs, are most likely to be driven
by a proton that is mobilized in a specific direction, causing significant
b- or y-fragment enhancement. To the authors’ knowledge, this
effect is not explained by any previously proposed mechanisms and
provides an interesting avenue of study.

Here, we confirm, for
>400 proteins (152 of those with significant
TMDs), that preferential CAD and HCD fragmentation in TMDs and the
corresponding decrease in ETD fragmentation depends critically on
the location of the charges driving dissociation. During ETD, the
protons driving cleavage remain localized to basic residues and cannot
extend into the nonpolar TMDs. Conversely, the charges driving CAD
and HCD are mobilized away from those same basic residues. Coulombic
repulsion appears to be driving this migration. The charges naturally
migrate to TMDs due to their almost complete lack of charge density.
While the interactions driving this migration (whose results can be
observed >10 residues distant) are not well understood, further
evidence
of it can be found in the proportion of b- vs y-fragments cleaved
by HCD and CAD, which is directly dependent on whether the fragment
is N- or C-terminal to the nearest basic residue. To the authors’
knowledge, this is the first strong evidence for the dependence of
threshold dissociation on the direction of proton migration.

Conclusions
While many fragmentation studies have been performed on large data
sets of digested peptides, no similar information exists for the intact
proteins analyzed in top down proteomics. Here, we find that TMDs,
as predicted by the TMHMM algorithm, are indeed preferentially cleaved
by CAD and HCD but are generally avoided by ETD. From a proteomics
standpoint, CAD and HCD can provide excellent sequence coverage of
IMPs, aiding in their identification, while ETD helps to localize
PTMs by providing more complete information in soluble regions. Further,
the prediction of cleavages for scoring using posterior probability
models incorporating a priori information will be
greatly improved with the inclusion of residues’ TMHMM scores.

The almost complete lack of basic residues in the TMDs is the most
likely cause of their interesting fragmentation properties. ETD is
simply too localized to basic residues to cleave in TMDs, while the
protons driving CAD and HCD are pushed there due to repulsion from
those same basic residues. Although fragmentation by mobilized protons
is difficult to characterize, it is clearly one of the main driving
forces in protein fragmentation.
