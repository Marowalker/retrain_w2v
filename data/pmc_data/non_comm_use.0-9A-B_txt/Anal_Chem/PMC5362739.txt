As mass spectrometry-based metabolomics
becomes more widely used in biomedical research, it is important to
revisit existing data analysis paradigms. Existing data preprocessing
efforts have largely focused on methods which start by extracting
features separately from each sample, followed by a subsequent attempt
to group features across samples to facilitate comparisons. We show
that this preprocessing approach leads to unnecessary variability
in peak quantifications that adversely impacts downstream analysis.
We present a new method, bakedpi, for the preprocessing of both centroid
and profile mode metabolomics data that relies on an intensity-weighted
bivariate kernel density estimation on a pooling of all samples to
detect peaks. This new method reduces this unnecessary quantification
variability and increases power in downstream differential analysis.

As mass spectrometry-based metabolomics
becomes a more mature and popular means of scientific investigation,1−3 it is important to revisit existing data analysis paradigms. Existing
approaches to preprocessing metabolomics data focus on a two-step
approach which starts by extracting features (peaks) separately from
each sample, followed by a subsequent attempt to group features across
samples to facilitate comparisons.4 In
particular, there has been considerable attention in the literature
on individual stages of preprocessing, including peak detection5−14 and alignment.15−18 Additional work has been done on specific issues with downstream
differential analysis such as missing information or dependence structures.19−21 Single sample processing methods tend to focus on reducing bias.
The bias-variance trade-off22 shows that
the overall performance of a method also depends on its noise and
experience from gene expression studies suggests that noise can be
removed by processing samples jointly.

In this work, we investigate
the consequences of traditional sample-specific preprocessing on the
quality of differential analysis. We show that the retention time
(RT) bounds that arise from preprocessing samples individually cause
unnecessary variability in peak quantifications (based on integrated
peak area) which leads to under-powered differential analysis. We
propose a relative quantification method, called bakedpi, which addresses
this shortcoming by jointly detecting and bounding peaks in the two-dimensional m/z-RT space, across all samples simultaneously.
The backbone of our method is an intensity-weighted bivariate kernel
density estimation that is computed on a pooling of all samples. We
show that this approach reduces unnecessary quantification variability
and increases power in downstream differential analysis. Our method
is open source and freely available as part of the yamss package through
the Bioconductor project under Artistic License 2.0.

Results and Discussion
Excess
Variability with Sample-Specific Processing
To demonstrate
issues with sample specific detection and bounding of peaks, we consider
the widely used software packages XCMS23 and MZmine2.24 Output for one peak from
a QTOF data set with two sample groups is shown in Figure 1 (additional examples from
other data sets in Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). The shape, width, and location of this peak do not appear
to vary across samples. Despite this, the XCMS and MZmine2 RT bounds
for this peak, indicated by blue and purple rectangles respectively,
are highly heterogeneous between samples (Figure 1c). To a first approximation, the retention
time (RT) bounds can be grouped into narrow and wide bounds; this
grouping is not associated with the two sample groups (light and dark
rectangles). As a consequence, the integrated peak area is completely
determined by whether the RT bounds are narrow or wide (Figure 1d,e), and this leads to high
variability in the peak quantifications (Figure 1f). If instead, we use the same RT bound
across all samples (Figure 1c, orange rectangle), we substantially reduce the between-sample
variability in the peak quantifications (Figure 1f). Excess variability results in loss of
power in a differential analysis.

part d but for MZmine. (f) Distribution of peak quantifications, based
on the peak bounds in part c. Substantial heterogeneity in the sample-specific
bounds leads to excess variability in the quantifications; this is
addressed by using the same RT bound for all samples.

Joint Sample Processing with bakedpi
To address the problem of excess variability, we propose a method
which jointly detects and bounds peaks across all samples in an experiment
(see Methods); an important feature of our
method is the use of homogeneous RT bounds across all samples. We
pool the data from all samples into a single metasample, on which
we detect and bound peaks (Figure 2a,b). To do this, we use intensity-weighted bivariate
kernel density estimation in the two-dimensional m/z-RT space. By using the intensities as weights,
we differentiate between groups of detected m/z values (data points) with high and low intensities. The
output is a smooth density in the m/z-RT space, where peaks in the density correspond to clusters of high-intensity
points (Figure 2c).
To detect and bound peaks, we slice the density using a single global
threshold and form a set of contiguous regions based on the density
slices. By performing this procedure on a single metasample, we ensure
the same peak bounds across all samples. Like XCMS and MZmine2, we
quantify the peaks by integrating the extracted ion chromatogram (EIC)
for each sample across the peak’s RT bounds. We can optionally
perform RT alignment prior to density estimation. Our method has 3
parameters: 2 of these parameters control the bandwidth in the m/z and RT domains and are easy to set
based on the resolution of the instrument. The last parameter, the
only significant tuning parameter, is the global density threshold.
We call our method bakedpi for bivariate approximate kernel density
estimation for peak identification.

We depict a selected rectangle in m/z-RT space for (a) one sample and (b) the pooled metasample. m/z values with higher intensity are shown
in red, lower with blue. (c) The weighted bivariate density estimate.

Joint Sample Processing
Reduces Excess Variability
We applied bakedpi to 10 different
data sets from 7 different experiments. Features of these data sets
are summarized in Table 1. All data sets were subset (if necessary) to only contain two sample
groups, to keep the experimental design simple and constant. For the
Orbitrap data set (MTLS216) we expect little to no differences between
the sample groups, based on the design of the experiment.25 We ran XCMS, MZmine2, and bakedpi on the 10
data sets. XCMS parameters were optimized using the IPO package available
on Bioconductor26 using recommended starting
values for most data sets (Methods). MZmine2
parameters were set based on optimized XCMS parameters where possible
(Methods). When running bakedpi, we use the
higher of a fixed quantile cutoff and a data-driven cutoff to set
the global tuning parameter (Methods).

To compare
the quantification variability between bakedpi and XCMS and between
bakedpi and MZmine2, we first identified peaks which overlapped between
bakedpi and XCMS and between bakedpi and MZmine2. We will call these
shared peaks. The number of peaks detected by both methods as well
as the percentage of peaks that are common to both methods are shown
in Supplementary Figure S3; for many data
sets the overlap is around 60–80% of the peaks. On these overlapping
peaks, we computed the residual standard deviation of the log-abundances
to assess their variability. We used residual standard deviation to
avoid being influenced by changes in the log-abundances between the
two sample groups in the different experiments. Figure 3 shows the distribution of differences in
residual standard deviation (XCMS or MZmine2 minus bakedpi) for each
data set. Values greater than zero indicate that bakedpi has smaller
variability than the other method. For all data sets examined, more
than half of the peaks detected by both methods had lower variability
when quantified by bakedpi; for some data sets it was substantially
higher.

Figure 3 Variability comparison of peak quantifications. (a) For peaks that
are detected both by bakedpi and XCMS, the distribution of the differences
in residual standard deviation for all data sets are shown as violin
plots. Each violin is a mirrored density plot; the median is indicated
by a horizontal red line. (b) Like part a but for MZmine. For all
data sets, the majority of peaks detected by both methods have quantifications
that are less variable when quantified with bakedpi.

Joint Processing Improves Power in a Differential
Analysis
We next sought to determine if the decrease in residual
standard deviation of the peak quantifications leads to increased
power in a differential analysis. We used the limma27 differential analysis pipeline as it has been shown to
provide robust and powerful inference for proteomics data.28 This method was originally developed to analyze
microarray expression studies and uses empirical Bayes techniques
to shrink feature (adduct)-wise variances toward a common underlying
value to provide more stable inference. The resulting p-value distributions for the shared peaks in the timecourse_4 h data
set are shown in Figure 4a (additional data sets in Supplementary Figure S4). For the majority of the data sets, bakedpi has a p-value distribution that is more peaked around zero than
XCMS and MZmine2, indicating that bakedpi detects more significant
peaks among the overlapping peaks. When comparing with XCMS, the timecourse_24
h data set is the only one in which XCMS has a taller peak arount
zero. When comparing with MZmine2, only for the CAMERA_pos data set
does MZmine2 have a taller peak around zero.

analysis quality and type I error control in the timecourse_4 h data
set. (a) Distribution of p-values for peaks detected
by both bakedpi and XCMS. (b) Like part a but for MZmine, (c) median
error rate over null permutations as a function of the nominal error
rate.

Higher detection rates alone do
not necessarily indicate an increase in power. To assess power, we
also evaluated the type I error control of the methods. We performed
a permutation experiment in which we shuffled the sample group labels
so that each of the new comparison groups were composed half of cases
and half of controls. For example, in an experiment with eight cases
and eight controls, the new permuted “case” group would
include four true cases and four true controls, as would the new permuted “control”
group. In this way, we created null data sets in which no abundance
differences are expected. With data sets containing a sufficient number
of samples, we performed 1000 permutations. Otherwise we enumerated
all permutations satisfying the balancing characteristic just described.
We again used limma to perform differential testing. Results of the
permutation experiment for the timecourse_4 h data set are shown in Figure 4c (additional data
sets in Supplementary Figure S5). For a
range of nominal type I error rates, we computed the median observed
error rate over all permutations. For all 10 data sets, all methods
are quite conservative, showing a markedly lower error rate than the
nominal value for the entire range. For most of the data sets, bakedpi
is the most conservative of the three methods. The combination of
more conservative type I error control and a higher detection rate
indicates that bakedpi has higher power to detect differences than
the sample-by-sample processing procedures of XCMS and MZmine2.

Retention Time Alignment
It is well established that RT
deviations between experimental runs can complicate the matching of
peaks across samples. We investigated the impact of correcting RT
drift on the variability improvements of our method using multiple
strategies. First, we used the RT warping function computed by XCMS
to align the raw data before computing the density estimate. Second,
we computed local sample-specific RT shifts that maximized the correlation
of the chromatograms between samples and used these shifts to align
the raw data. Third, we used correlation-optimal shifts to align peaks
already detected from the density estimate before quantification.
None of these RT alignment strategies had a large impact on the variability
of detected features. The proportion of peaks detected by both bakedpi
and XCMS or MZmine2 that had lower variability with bakedpi did not
change appreciably with these RT corrections (Supplementary Figure S6).

Parameter Choices
Because the detection of peaks and their bounds depend on the cutoff
applied to the density estimate, it is important to investigate the
sensitivity of method performance to this cutoff. We performed a sensitivity
analysis by varying the density cutoff and examining the p-value distribution resulting from the detected peaks (Supplementary Figures S7 and S8). Raising the
cutoff to be more stringent or lowering the cutoff to be more inclusive
generally does not have a substantial impact on the global pattern
of inference as assessed by p-value distributions.

Method-Specific Peaks
There are a number of peaks that are
detected only by one method (Supplementary Figure S3). As comprehensive gold standard information on the true
peaks corresponding to compounds was not available, we examined the
characteristics of these method-specific peaks to assess their quality
(Supplementary Figures S9–S12).
For more than half of the data sets, XCMS-specific peaks tend to have
more extreme t-statistics and lower p-values. For half the data sets, MZmine2 peaks have higher p-values than bakedpi. For nearly all data sets, bakedpi-specific
peaks have greater peak heights than XCMS- and MZmine2-specific peaks
with comparable peak widths. Peaks specific to bakedpi are also more
likely to be supported by all samples in the experiment. The last
two observations are sensible given that bakedpi relies on an intensity-weighted
density estimation; a peak is more likely to be detected when a large
number of high-intensity points are close together. Based on observations
about t-statistics and p-values,
it is not clear that one of the two sets of methods-specific peaks
is best. If peaks with greater heights or greater numbers of samples
supporting them are more likely to be of scientific interest, then
bakedpi-specific peaks seem to be of higher quality than XCMS- or
MZmine2-specific peaks. Given the lack of gold standard data on peak
identities, evaluation of method-specific peaks is less clear than
evaluation of peaks common to multiple methods. On peaks common to
both bakedpi and MZmine2 or XCMS, bakedpi shows a clear reduction
in quantification variability and an increase in statistical power.

Conclusions
We have proposed a method for the joint processing
of metabolomics data across samples, which reduces variability in
peak quantification across samples, leading to increased power in
a differential analysis. We take the position that the most important
task in metabolomics is the identification of differentially abundant
peaks, in contrast to, e.g., identifying all peaks in a sample. Our
method compares favorably to XCMS and MZmine2 across 10 data sets
and will be useful for drawing better and more substantiated inferences
from untargeted metabolomics studies. We do note that the commercial
software Progenesis CoMet also uses the idea of pooling samples into
a metasample for processing. However, details on CoMet method are
not available, making it impossible to comment further on differences
between the two approaches.

A limitation of our approach is
that peaks that are only truly present in a small fraction of the
samples are unlikely to be detected. Such metabolites may be of interest
but are by definition less well supported by the observed data. In
developing bakedpi, we have chosen to focus on peaks with sufficient
information across all samples and on obtaining for those peaks the
best quality quantifications for the purposes of differential analysis.

It is important to note that the benefit of our method is dependent
on using peak areas for quantification rather than peak height. As
we show, the variability in quantification of a particular peak across
samples is driven entirely by the variability in peak width. If peak
height is used instead of peak area, our method will show the same
quantification as XCMS and MZMine2, provided the sample-specific RT
bounds contain the mode of the peak; this is true for two of our three
examples.

In our evaluation of bakedpi, we have used both centroid-mode
and profile-mode data sets with fairly stable chromatography. The
RT drift we observe in these data sets is not so large that corresponding
peaks from different samples do not overlap. However, stable chromatography
is not required for bakedpi to work because we do implement RT alignment
procedures. Our evaluation data sets also come from mass spectrometers
with a range of mass accuracies from 5 ppm on Q-TOF instruments to
less than 1 ppm on the Orbitrap, so bakedpi is able to handle data
from a representative range of instruments. We expect lower mass accuracy
to make peak merging more likely and to cause peak m/z bounds to be wider than necessary, but this is
mostly a feature of low mass accuracy in general. Currently, our method
is implemented as the standalone yamss package as part of the Bioconductor
project.

Processing with XCMS and MZmine2
XCMS parameters were optimized using the IPO package available on
Bioconductor26 using recommended starting
values for most data sets. Because optimization for the MTBLS2 and
MTBLS213 data sets required significant computational time (we terminated
the optimization after 11 days), we either fixed parameters that could
be reasonably inferred beforehand (such as ppm) or set a smaller range
of values over which to optimize. MZmine2 parameters were set based
on optimized XCMS parameters where possible. In particular, the “prefilter”,
“mzdiff”, minimum and maximum peakwidth, and ppm parameters
from XCMS had near equivalents in MZmine2 parameters. For XCMS, we
used the “centWave” algorithm9 for the nine centroid-mode data sets and the “matchedFilter”
algorithm23 for the profile-mode MTBLS126
data set. We used the density method for peak grouping, the obiwarp
method for retention time alignment, and the fillPeaks method to fill
in information for peaks missing from certain samples. For MZmine2,
we used the GridMass module for peak detection,36 the join aligner for retention time alignment, and the
same-range gap filler module. Details on optimization and parameter
settings for XCMS and MZmine2 are provided in the Supporting Information.

Processing Workflow
Our processing procedure consists of three steps. First is background
correction which increases the signal-to-noise ratio of true peaks.
Second is RT alignment, which aligns the raw data to correct for drifts
in compound elution times between samples; this is optional. Third
is density estimation to detect peaks.

Background Correction
Background correction is performed on each sample separately. We
divide the m/z-RT space into bins
and estimate background separately for each bin; this is arbitrarily
done for bins of width 10 m/z units
and 40 scans in the RT domain. We observe that each grid region exhibits
a multimodal intensity distribution with 2 or more modes (Supplementary Figure S13) and reason that the
lowest mode is background. We estimate the location of the mode with
the first peak of the kernel density estimate of the intensity distribution
and subtract this value from all observations in the grid region.

Retention Time Alignment
We investigated two RT alignment
procedures that could be applied to the raw data before peak detection
and one procedure that could be applied after peak detection. The
first prepeak detection approach was to use the sample-specific corrected
RTs reported by XCMS to define a RT warping function that could be
applied to the raw data to yield aligned RTs. In the second approach,
we found tentative m/z regions containing
peaks using univariate kernel density estimation and computed EICs
in these regions for all samples. For each region and sample, we then
found the shift that would maximize the correlation between the EICs
in each sample and a reference sample (the sample with the largest
area beneath the EIC). These local and sample-specific shifts were
applied to the raw data to yield aligned RTs. We also investigated
a correction procedure that could be applied to peaks that had already
been detected. For each detected peak, we computed the sample-specific
shifts that would maximize the correlation between the EICs in each
sample and a reference sample (the sample with the largest area beneath
the EIC). We then recomputed the peak quantifications using the original
RT bounds and shifted EICs.

Bivariate Density Estimation
To
detect peaks, we pool all samples into a single metasample by concatenating
the spectral information from all of the samples. For example, the
spectral information for the first scan of the metasample is formed
by concatenating the first scan’s spectral information from
the individual samples. We use this metasample to estimate a two-dimensional
density in the m/z-RT space. We
represent the input data as a set of data points (Mj, Tj, Ij), where Mj is the mass over charge (m/z) of the jth data point
(all samples are pooled), Tj is the scan number (RT in seconds divided by number of scans
per second), and Ij is
the intensity. Per sample, T typically has up to
a few thousand unique values depending on the scan rate of the mass
spectrometer and the duration of the experiment, and M has on the order of one hundred observations per scan in centroid-mode
data and several hundred in profile-mode data. Thus, the data consists
of tens of thousands of data points such triples for each sample.

The bivariate intensity-weighted density estimator using a Gaussian
kernel at a point (m, t) in m/z-RT space is given by  where j = 1, ..., n indexes the n data points, hM and hT are the bandwidths
in m/z and RT space, respectively,
and ϕ2 is a bivariate Gaussian density. The density
estimate is not highly sensitive to the RT bandwidth, and a default
of bandwidth of 10 scans is recommended. The m/z bandwidth should be set based on the type of mass spectrometer
used and is recommended to be 0.005 for TOF and 0.002 for Orbitrap
instruments. Because the density estimate involves a sum over all n data points at each value of (m, t), we use various approaches to make this computationally
tractable. First, we use a diagonal covariance matrix for the bivariate
kernel; this implies the factorization  We do this because our focus is on identifying regions of interest
rather than on highly exact estimation of the density.37 Second, we use a simple binning strategy38 where the m/z-RT space is binned and a single representative value for each bin
is chosen. In the RT domain, the default bin width is 1 scan, and
in the m/z domain the default bin
width is set to be equal to the bandwidth (0.005 for TOF and 0.002
for Orbitrap). Third, we use a Gaussian kernel truncated at ±3,
effectively only including points close to (m, t) in the summation.38 Fourth,
in our implementation, we make use of sparse linear algebra as well
as efficient data structures for selecting points close to (m, t) as implemented in the data.table
package.39

After obtaining the density
estimate, we select a cutoff using information from the strongest
(most intense) features in the data. The m/z domain is divided into bins of a default width of 2 m/z. Within each bin, the most intense
data point is selected. We assume that this data point belongs to
a true feature and use local univariate density estimation in the m/z and RT domains to define a m/z and RT window for this feature. We
compute quantiles of the density estimate values in these regions
and compute the mode of this quantile distribution for various quantile
values. For example, we compute the 99th percentile for each of the
approximately 500 strong feature regions and compute the mode of this
distribution. We repeat this for a wide range of percentiles. We then
order these modes and select the first mode substantially different
from zero as a cutoff. To ensure reasonable peak bounds, we enforce
that this cutoff should be greater than or equal to the 99th percentile
of nonzero density values. Applying the cutoff to the density estimate
matrix yields a binary matrix that denotes peak and nonpeak regions.
In order to obtain m/z and RT bounds
for these peak regions, we use a connected components labeling algorithm.40
