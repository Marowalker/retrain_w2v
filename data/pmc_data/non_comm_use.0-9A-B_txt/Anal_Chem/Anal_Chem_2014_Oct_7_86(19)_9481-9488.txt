Demand for highly sensitive, robust
diagnostics and environmental
monitoring methods has led to extensive research in improving reporter
technologies. Inorganic phosphorescent materials exhibiting persistent
luminescence are commonly found in electroluminescent displays and
glowing paints but are not widely used as reporters in diagnostic
assays. Persistent luminescence nanoparticles (PLNPs) offer advantages
over conventional photoluminescent probes, including the potential
for enhanced sensitivity by collecting time-resolved measurements
or images with decreased background autofluorescence while eliminating
the need for expensive optical hardware, superior resistance to photobleaching,
amenability to quantitation, and facile bioconjugation schemes. We
isolated rare-earth doped strontium aluminate PLNPs from larger-particle
commercial materials by wet milling and differential sedimentation
and water-stabilized the particles by silica encapsulation using a
modified Stöber process. Surface treatment with aldehyde silane
followed by reductive amination with heterobifunctional amine-poly(ethylene
glycol)-carboxyl allowed covalent attachment of proteins to the particles
using standard carbodiimide chemistry. NeutrAvidin PLNPs were used
in lateral flow assays (LFAs) with biotinylated lysozyme as a model
analyte in buffer and monoclonal anti-lysozyme HyHEL-5 antibodies
at the test line. Preliminary experiments revealed a limit of detection
below 100 pg/mL using the NeutrAvidin PLNPs, which was approximately
an order of magnitude more sensitive than colloidal gold.

Growing demand
for reliable
diagnostic tests for pathogens and disease biomarkers in low-resource
and point-of-care (POC) settings has led to significant research in
developing new assay technologies such as cellphone-based diagnostics1 and new or improved photoluminescent reporters.2 One of the more promising assay formats for POC
diagnostics is the immunochromatographic lateral flow assay (LFA),
which is widely known from its use in home pregnancy tests.3,4

LFAs using photoluminescent labels such as fluorescent nanoparticles
and quantum dots have been shown to have higher sensitivity and wider
dynamic range than LFAs that use conventional gold nanoparticles.5 The increased sensitivity from photoluminescent
reporters, however, is not without drawbacks. Fluorescent dyes are
prone to photobleaching, and fluorescence measurements require continuous
excitation, which increases the cost and complexity of the readout
device.6 Background autofluorescence at
the wavelengths of the reporter’s emission can also limit sensitivity.7,8

Upconverting phosphors (UCPs) that emit visible light upon
excitation
by infrared or near-infrared sources have seen increased use in LFAs9−11 and biological imaging applications12,13 and offer
advantages over conventional fluorescent labels including minimal
background autofluorescence and high resistance to photobleaching.
However, UCPs have low quantum yields (e.g., 3% for bulk samples of
NaYF4:Er3+,Yb3+ and 0.3% for 100
nm particles),14 and the efficiency decreases
dramatically at low optical power densities of the excitation source.15 Therefore, many readers for UCP assays are complex,
using laser diodes for excitation, in combination with other hardware
such as lenses, filters, photomultiplier tubes, preamplifiers, and
stepper motors.16−20

One strategy to simultaneously reduce the cost of the reader
by
eliminating the need for optical filters and decrease background autofluorescence
is to carry out time-resolved measurements wherein a reporter with
a longer emission lifetime than typical fluorophores (e.g., 100 μs
compared to 10 ns)6,21 is used, and a time delay between
excitation and measurement is introduced to allow for decay of the
background signal.7,8,22,23 Phosphorescent metal chelates typically
used in time-resolved assays, however, have photostability issues24 and must be observed during their short remaining
period of brightness after a carefully defined delay time.

Here,
we introduce assay reporters based on persistent luminescence
nanoparticles (PLNPs) that emit intense visible light for several
minutes after excitation. Persistent luminescence (sometimes also
referred to as phosphorescence or long-lasting phosphorescence) in
solids generally arises when an inorganic host material is doped with
small amounts of an activator metal, which alters the electronic structure,
resulting in trapping of charge carriers in metastable states upon
excitation.7,25−27 Gradual detrapping
by thermal activation causes luminescence from electron–hole
recombination.26−30 A wide variety of materials exhibiting persistent luminescence have
been synthesized, including the relatively common zinc sulfide phosphors.
Strontium aluminate doped with europium and dysprosium (SrAl2O4:Eu2+,Dy3+) is a persistent luminescence
material with a long and bright afterglow that is observable by eye
for several hours after excitation31 and
is highly resistant to photobleaching with only a 20% loss in luminescence
intensity after constant exposure to 370 nm UV light for 2 weeks,32 making it popular in applications like luminescent
paint. It is one of the brightest known persistent luminescence materials,
with an afterglow intensity about ten times that of ZnS:Cu,Co phosphors.31 Strontium aluminate has been extensively studied
to understand the mechanisms that give rise to its persistent luminescence,30,33 to assess the effects of concentration and type of rare earth dopants
on the emission wavelength, intensity, and lifetime, to examine changes
in the luminescence properties by substitution of strontium for other
alkaline earth metals,34 and to improve
synthesis strategies.35−37

PLNPs have recently appeared as reporters for in vitro binding assays38 and in vivo imaging39−41 but have not yet been used in
LFAs to the best of
our knowledge. Here, we demonstrate the use of strontium aluminate
PLNPs as reporters in LFAs with biotinylated hen egg lysozyme (bHEL)
as a model analyte. Size reduction of the phosphors by wet milling
and separation by centrifugal settling, followed by silica encapsulation
for water-stability, yielded particles small enough to move in the
LFA membranes while retaining luminescence bright enough for low-picomolar
(7 pM) bHEL detection without the need for optical filters or continuous
excitation. Our results show that PLNPs are a promising class of materials
for LFAs and potentially other in vitro diagnostics
applications requiring robustness and high sensitivity. Developing
assays with PLNPs as reporters could lead to more sensitive point-of-care
tests with significantly cheaper and simpler field-portable readers.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Reagents
Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS),
96% 1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane (BTEOSE), hydroxylamine hydrochloride,
3350 g/mol polyethylene glycol (PEG), 2-(N-Morpholino)ethanesulfonic
acid sodium salt (MES), 99.9% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), Tween 20, Triton X-100, bovine serum albumin
(BSA), and lysozyme from chicken egg white were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Sodium cyanoborohydride and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
(EDC) were purchased from Thermo Scientific. Ethyl acetate, ammonium
acetate, and 28–30% ammonium hydroxide were obtained from EM
Science (Gibbstown, N.J.). Other reagents and their respective suppliers
were glacial acetic acid (Macron), triethoxysilylbutyraldehyde (TESBA;
Gelest), 3400 g/mol amine-polyethylene glycol-carboxyl (NH2-PEG-COOH; NANOCS), anhydrous ethanol (VWR), dibasic potassium phosphate
(Spectrum), monobasic potassium phosphate (J. T. Baker), and phosphate
buffered saline tablets (Bioline). Sodium hydroxide (Macron) and hydrochloric
acid (Fisher Scientific) were used for titrating buffers to the desired
pH. Buffers were prepared with deionized water (Millipore Milli-Q)
and filtered with nonpyrogenic sterile polystyrene filters (Corning
Product #430625). The phosphorescent strontium aluminate powder used
in all LFAs was purchased from Glow Inc. (Ultra Green v10 Glow in
the Dark Powder). Phosphors obtained from Ambient Glow Technology
(Product #AGT-SYS-F) were used in preliminary milling and silica encapsulation
experiments. BD Falcon Microtest 96-well black plates were used for
luminescence characterization measurements (BD Biosciences, Franklin
Lakes, NJ). NeutrAvidin was purchased from Thermo Scientific (Product
#31000). Streptavidin gold nanoparticles, 40 nm, were purchased from
DCN Diagnostics (Carlsbad, CA; Product #PACG-060). Mouse anti-lysozyme
monoclonal HyHEL-5 antibodies were produced from hybridoma cells and
purified by Protein G Affinity Chromatography by Biovest/National
Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN).

Biotinylation of Lysozyme
BSA and lysozyme were biotinylated
at room temperature for 90 min using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Thermo
Scientific, Product #21335). Excess biotinylation reagent was removed
using Zeba Spin Desalting Columns (Thermo Scientific, Product #89892).
The number of biotin molecules per protein was estimated by a HABA
assay using NeutrAvidin, premade HABA solution from Thermo Scientific
(Product #1854180), and absorbance measurements taken with a NanoDrop
ND-1000 Spectrophotometer. HABA assay results indicated an average
biotinylation of 1.2 biotin/protein for BSA and 2.5 biotin/protein
for lysozyme.

Milling and Fractionation
Typically
3–5 g of
phosphorescent strontium aluminate powder was dispersed in 30–50
mL of ethyl acetate in a ceramic milling jar (U.S. Stoneware Roalox
Alumina-Fortified Grinding Jar, Size 000, 0.3 Liters) with 15 large
(3/8 in. diameter × 3/8 in. length) and 10 small (1/4 in. diameter
× 1/4 in. length) magnesia stabilized zirconia cylinders as grinding
media and placed on a mill (U.S. Stoneware, Model 755RMV Unitized
Jar Mill) at 60% power (≈110 rpm) for 7–9 days. After
wet milling, the colloidal dispersion of phosphors was collected and
the ethyl acetate was removed by room temperature evaporation. Dry
milled phosphorescent powder was then dispersed in ethanol, and fractions
with different size distributions were isolated by differential centrifugal
sedimentation with a Beckman Coulter Avanti J-E centrifuge in 50 mL
centrifuge tubes. The centrifugal settling process was repeated until
the concentration of particles in a fraction approached 2–4
mg/mL, as measured by evaporating the ethanol from a known volume
of a particle suspension and weighing the remaining dry mass with
a Mettler Toledo XS64 analytical balance.

Silica Encapsulation
Typically, 1.6 mg of dry milled
size-fractionated phosphorescent particles was suspended in 1 mL of
anhydrous ethanol in a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube. A solution containing
approximately 222 μL of ethanol, 247 μL of DI water, and
6.7 μL of TEOS was prepared, vigorously agitated, and then added
immediately to the suspension of phosphors in ethanol. The tube with
the particles was then placed in a bath sonicator (Fisher Scientific
FS30) for 5 min, and afterward, 25 μL of aqueous ammonium hydroxide
(28–30%) was added to the reaction mixture, bringing the final
volume to 1.5 mL. The calculated concentrations of TEOS and ammonia
were 20 mM and 0.25 M, respectively, with approximately 17.5% v/v
water and 81.4% v/v ethanol. After adding the ammonium hydroxide,
the particles were sonicated for an additional 30 min and then placed
on a room temperature rotator for 7.5 h to keep the particles suspended,
with an overall silica encapsulation time of approximately 8 h. Silica
encapsulation was stopped by centrifuging to induce settling (Eppendorf
Centrifuge 5418), removing the supernatant, and resuspending the particles
in ethanol by vigorous agitation with a Fisher Vortex Genie 2 and
sonication. After 4 wash cycles, the particles were dried in a Savant
SpeedVac Concentrator SVC100H at 36 °C under reduced pressure
for 1 h.

Aldehyde Functionalization
Aldehydes were introduced
on the surfaces of the silica encapsulated particles by reacting the
particles with TESBA in the presence of BTEOSE as a crosslinker for
enhanced water stability of the surface aldehydes. Aldehyde functionalization
was carried out with 50 mM TESBA and 25 mM BTEOSE in 5% v/v DI water
in ethanol, with 1.6 mg (dry strontium aluminate basis) of encapsulated
particles suspended in a 1 mL reaction volume. The particles were
sonicated during the first 20 min of the reaction and placed on a
rotator at room temperature for an additional 40 min. The particles
were then washed in ethanol. After 3 wash cycles, the particles were
dried for 20 min in a Savant SpeedVac Concentrator SVC100H at 36 °C
under reduced pressure.

PEG-Carboxylation
A stock solution
of 20 mM heterobifunctional
3400 g/mol NH2-PEG-COOH was prepared in DMSO. Conjugation
of the PEG chains to the particle surfaces was carried out by reductive
amination in which aldehyde functionalized particles were dispersed
in 500 μL of phosphate buffer (115 mM K2HPO4, 15 mM KH2PO4, adjusted to pH 7.8), in the
presence of 250 mM sodium cyanoborohydride with 0.5 mM NH2-PEG-COOH diluted from the stock solution. The particles were placed
on a Cole-Parmer Roto-Torque rotator for 24 h at room temperature
and then washed at least three times in deionized water.

Bioconjugation
Bioconjugation was carried out using
carbodiimide chemistry. Carboxylated phosphors were washed in 50 mM,
pH 5.8 MES buffer and then suspended in MES buffer with 60 mM EDC
and 30 mM NHS for 30 min to activate the carboxyl groups. After activation,
the particles were centrifuged, the supernatant was removed, and the
particles were resuspended in 500 μL of pH 7.4 PBS with 0.1
mg/mL NeutrAvidin and placed on a rotator for 5 h. After bioconjugation,
any remaining activated carboxyls were quenched by suspending the
particles in 0.1 M hydroxylamine in PBS for an additional 2 h.

Particle
Size Analysis
Optical microscopy images of
the particles were taken with a Nikon Eclipse LV100D-U at various
times during the wet milling process to assess the extent of size
reduction. During fractionation experiments, the average particle
size was monitored using dynamic light scattering (DLS) with a Brookhaven
BI-200SM. Final size distributions of unencapsulated phosphors were
obtained using an Affinity Biosensors Archimedes Particle Metrology
system, with the particles suspended in anhydrous ethanol. Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken with a LEO 1525 field
emission SEM for size and morphology analysis.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
(XPS), Energy Dispersive X-ray
Spectroscopy (EDS), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
Qualitative elemental analysis of the as-purchased phosphorescent
powder was carried out with a JEOL JSM-6330F field emission SEM equipped
with an AMETEK EDAX Octane Pro energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) system to confirm the identity of the rare earth dopants and
verify that the host material is strontium aluminate. EDS data are
provided in the Supporting Information (Figure
S11). XPS was used for elemental analysis and surface characterization
of particles. Spectra were collected with a Physical Electronics PHI
5700 system equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source
(1486.7 eV) at a 45° takeoff angle. Particles were spotted on
a gold film on a silicon wafer. Silica-coated phosphors were characterized
by TEM (JEOL, Model JEOL-2000 FX, operating at 200 kV). For the TEM
analyses, silica-coated phosphors suspended in ethanol were deposited
on a 300-mesh holey carbon-coated copper grid and allowed to dry at
room temperature before imaging.

Luminescence Decay Kinetics
Luminescence decay kinetics
were measured with a Tecan Infinite M200 Pro microplate reader in
luminescence mode with no emission filters. Phosphors were excited
under a Chauvet 18 in., 370 nm, 15 W UV light for 3 min and were immediately
loaded into the instrument to commence measurement. Each decay curve
was normalized by its initial intensity.

LFA Membrane Preparation
Whatman (GE Healthcare) FF80HP
nitrocellulose membranes were used in all LFAs. A ClaremontBio Lateral
Flow Reagent Dispenser powered by a programmable BK Precision 9130
DC power supply was used in combination with a Chemyx Inc. Fusion
200 syringe pump to spot proteins on the nitrocellulose membranes.
HyHEL-5 antibodies were diluted to a concentration of 0.8 mg/mL in
pH 6.9 phosphate buffer (15 mM KH2PO4, 15 mM
K2HPO4) and loaded into 1 mL BD Luer-Lok syringes,
then connected to the syringe pump, and dispensed at a rate of 0.2
mL/min with a 4 cm/s head speed. Biotinylated BSA was diluted to 0.25
mg/mL in pH 5.4 ammonium acetate buffer and dispensed at the same
flow rate and speed as the antibodies. Membranes were dried for 30
min at 37 °C in a Robbins Scientific Micro Hybridization Incubator
2000. The membranes were assembled on 0.010 in. adhesive cards from
DCN Diagnostics (Part #MIBA-020) with Whatman Standard 14 sample pads
and Whatman CF5 absorbent pads. The LFA strips were cut with a desktop
paper cutter such that the nitrocellulose part of the assembly was
approximately 0.5 × 4 cm.

LFA Image Acquisition and
Analysis
Typically 8–10
LFA strips were stuck on a 120 × 120 mm square Petri dish from
Greiner (Catalog #688102) using double-sided adhesive tape. A buffer
containing (wt %) 0.5% nonfat dry milk, 2% Tween-20, and 0.3% PEG-3350
in PBS was prepared for analyte dilutions. A wash buffer containing
0.3% PEG-3350, 1% Triton X-100, and 1.5% Tween 20 in PBS was also
prepared. NeutrAvidin PLNPs were diluted to a concentration of 0.2
mg/mL (strontium aluminate dry mass basis) in wash buffer. Each LFA
was run by applying 50 μL of analyte to the sample pad, followed
by 25 μL of wash buffer, 25 μL of 0.2 mg/mL NeutrAvidin
PLNPs, and 100 μL of wash buffer sequentially. The strips from
a given dilution series were imaged simultaneously with an Alpha Innotech
FluorChem SP gel documentation system. LFA strips were first excited
for 3 min with a 370 nm Chauvet 18 in., 15 W UV light and were then
loaded into the FluorChem and imaged with an 8 min exposure time in
high sensitivity/normal resolution mode. It should be noted that a
shorter exposure time (<1 min) can be used for imaging, albeit
with a lower signal-to-noise ratio. The approximate time delay between
excitation and the commencing image acquisition was 10 s. The Chauvet
light source was used in the LFA experiments herein to ensure even
excitation across all strips. However, smaller 2.5 mW low cost LEDs
(Thorlabs, Item #LED370E) have been used to effectively excite phosphors
in single LFA strips in other experiments with shorter excitation
times (<30 s). Boxes of equivalent size were drawn around the test
line and control line of each strip in ImageJ to calculate the average
pixel intensities that were used in Figure 6C and the statistical analysis. The LFA procedure was the same for
assays run with Streptavidin gold nanoparticles, except 25 μL
of Streptavidin gold at a concentration of ≈8.6 × 1010 particles/mL was applied to each strip instead of NeutrAvidin
PLNPs. Images of the LFA strips run with gold nanoparticles were acquired
with an iPhone 5s, and line scans of the strips were obtained using
ImageJ and an Epson Perfection V600 scanner.

Results and Discussion
Particle
Size Reduction and Analysis
The commercial
phosphorescent strontium aluminate powder consists of large particles
with effective diameters much greater than 10 μm, which settle
rapidly upon dispersion in liquid. For most diagnostics applications,
the particles must be suspendable in liquid without significant sedimentation
over short times, and for LFAs, the particles must pass through membranes
with pore sizes ranging from less than one micrometer to a few micrometers. The mean particle size was reduced by wet milling in ethyl acetate
with zirconia grinding media. SEM (Figure 1A) and optical microscopy (Figure S1, Supporting
Information) images show extensive size reduction after 24
h of wet milling, with few particles greater than 10 μm remaining.
Milling was extended to further reduce the average particle size and
polydispersity. The milled phosphors retain visible luminescence,
as shown in the image of milled phosphors dispersed in ethanol (Figure 1B).

Figure 1 (A) SEM image of phosphors after 9 days of wet milling
in ethyl
acetate with zirconia grinding media. (B) Image showing luminescence
from milled phosphors dispersed in ethanol after 30 s of excitation
with 370 nm UV light.

Differential sedimentation was used to isolate fractions
of phosphors
with lower polydispersity and smaller mean diameters to improve performance
of the particles in LFAs and for greater consistency in chemical functionalization.
A suspended microchannel resonator (Archimedes, Affinity Biosensors
LLC) was used for size characterization of the fractionated phosphors
at single-particle resolution with low-femtogram sensitivity.42,43 The instrument incorporates microfluidics to control the flow of
individual nanoparticles through a channel in a resonating cantilever
vibrating in vacuum, and an optoelectronic detection system measures
resonant frequency shifts which are used to calculate the nanoparticle
buoyant mass relative to the volume of the displaced liquid. Equivalent
spherical diameters for the particles were calculated from the data
giving an approximately normal distribution with a mean and standard
deviation of 248 and 81 nm, respectively. The size distribution in
Figure 2 was used to estimate the total particle
number in a measured dry mass.

milled phosphors

mean = 248 nm, and standard deviation = 81 nm.

Luminescence Decay Properties
Mechanical milling is
known to induce structural and atomic scale defects in solids, and
the luminescence properties of inorganic phosphors are strongly affected
by crystallinity. Defects can increase the relative rates of nonradiative
relaxation processes, reducing the luminescence lifetime and quantum
efficiency.44,45 We measured the luminescence
decay curves of milled and as-purchased unmilled strontium aluminate
phosphors to examine the effects of milling. The luminescence intensity
decreases to 10% of its initial measured value in approximately 13.4
and 7.0 min for unmilled and milled phosphors, respectively, after
excitation with a 370 nm UV light (Figure 3). The shorter lifetime of the milled phosphors may arise from increased
surface dead layer effects, as nonradiative recombination processes
may be more common at the surface.44 Although
milling slightly decreased the emission lifetime, the milled particles
retain a lifetime long enough for detection without continuous excitation
and are bright enough that approximately 10 ng of the particles can
be detected in a microplate reader in luminescence mode (Figure S2, Supporting Information).

normalized to the same initial intensity
for milled and unmilled phosphors after a 3 min excitation under a
370 nm UV light.

Silica Encapsulation
Strontium aluminate readily hydrolyzes
in water to form nonluminescent aluminum hydroxide precipitate and
soluble strontium hydroxide.46 Several
approaches have been investigated for improving water stability of
strontium aluminate including encapsulation with silica by sol–gel
or precipitation techniques,46 direct reaction
with phosphoric acid,47 and encapsulation
with triethanolamine.48 Due to the wide
use of trialkoxysilanes in bioconjugate chemistry and their high compatibility
with silica surfaces, we used a modified Stöber process to
form a silica shell around the phosphors.

Typical Stöber
protocols for encapsulating particles in silica involve the reaction
of TEOS in a ≈20% v/v water in ethanol solution with ammonium
hydroxide added as a catalyst. Since water is an essential reactant
in the Stöber process, but also degrades strontium aluminate,
we varied the initial water concentration to determine the optimum
concentration. When the total initial water concentration was decreased
to 3.4% v/v in ethanol with 20 mM TEOS and 0.5 M NH3, the
particles were not stable for more than a day in deionized (DI) water;
increasing the TEOS concentration to 40 mM did not improve stability.
Phosphors that were encapsulated using conditions similar to typical
Stöber recipes in literature49 with
a high water/TEOS molar ratio at approximately ≈18% v/v water
in ethanol were the most resistant to hydrolytic degradation. Hydrolysis
of alkoxy groups is known to be reversible,50−53 so it is likely that a water
concentration much greater than the stoichiometric ratio is needed
to drive TEOS hydrolysis to completion and form an effective silica
barrier around the phosphorescent core. Details on silica encapsulation
are provided in the Supporting Information. All phosphors referred to hereafter were encapsulated with silica
using the protocol described in the Experimental
Section. Phosphors treated with this protocol showed no significant
loss of luminescence or increase in pH over 2 weeks after resuspending
the particles in DI water, indicating negligible hydrolysis.

Surface Functionalization
and Characterization
Trialkoxysilanes
are commonly used for modifying the surface chemistry of glass and
silica for covalent attachment of biological macromolecules.54 Silica encapsulated phosphors were reacted with
TESBA to introduce aldehydes on the surface for reactions with primary
amines. Initially, proteins were directly coupled to the surface aldehydes,
but we found that introducing a bifunctional (PEG) spacer with a carboxylic
acid and an amine at opposite terminal ends of the chain, followed
by protein coupling with carbodiimide chemistry, resulted in particles
that were more easily suspended in aqueous buffer and had improved
transport through nitrocellulose membranes. BTEOSE was added during
aldehyde functionalization, as bridged silane coupling agents have
been shown to reduce the loss of PEG chains grafted onto silica nanoparticles
by trialkoxysilanes.55 A schematic showing
the surface chemistry of the phosphors is provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S6).

X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data from different stages of the
functionalization process are presented in Figure 4. Spectra of unencapsulated milled phosphors are similar to
those previously reported for strontium aluminate,35 with Sr 3s, 3p3/2, and 3d peaks at 359.6, 270.8,
and 135.6 eV and Al 2s and 2p peaks at 119.6 and 74.8 eV, respectively.
The peak at 286 eV is predominately C 1s with contributions from the
adjacent Sr 3p1/2 peak at 280.8 eV.56 The C 1s peak could be from impurities incorporated into
the host material during synthesis and surface contamination introduced
during milling and fractionation. Phosphors encapsulated by the modified
Stöber process showed prominent Si 2s and 2p peaks at 154.8
and 103.6 eV, respectively, and significantly reduced Sr and Al peaks,
indicating that the particles are encapsulated in silica with little
of the phosphorescent core material exposed at the surface. Analysis
of TEM images of the nanoparticles revealed an approximate silica
shell thickness of 50 nm (Figure S5, Supporting
Information). Phosphors functionalized with TESBA and BTEOSE,
followed by PEG and NeutrAvidin, show a N 1s peak at 399.6 eV demonstrating
conjugation of proteins to the surface. The high resolution C 1s peak
of the NeutrAvidin phosphors shows a small shoulder at 287.3 eV shifted
to a higher binding energy by approximately 3 eV from the main peak
at 284.3 eV, indicating the presence of carbonyls from amides and
carboxylic acids of the attached proteins (Figure 5).57,58

Lateral Flow Assay
We used biotinylated hen egg lysozyme
(bHEL) as a model analyte to demonstrate the use of strontium aluminate
PLNPs as LFA reporters. Nitrocellulose strips were functionalized
with a test line containing immobilized HyHEL-5 monoclonal anti-lysozyme
antibodies.59 PLNPs functionalized with
NeutrAvidin were used as reporters. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was
biotinylated and adsorbed on the nitrocellulose to serve as a control
line to capture NeutrAvidin PLNPs that flowed past the test line.
A schematic depicting the binding of a NeutrAvidin phosphor to bHEL
captured by antibodies at the test line is shown in Figure 6A. Serial dilutions of
bHEL were prepared in PBS containing 0.5% nonfat dry milk, 2% Tween-20,
and 0.3% PEG-3350. For LFAs run with PLNPs, the strips from a given
dilution series were excited under a 370 nm UV light for 3 min and
then transferred to a standard gel reader for imaging. Figure 6B shows a comparison between LFAs run with NeutrAvidin
PLNPs and Streptavidin gold nanoparticles as the reporter. The visible
detection limit for Streptavidin gold nanoparticles is close to 1
ng/mL of bHEL, although the test line signal at this concentration
is weak and barely discernible by eye. Line scans of the Streptavidin
gold LFA strips are shown in Figure S9, Supporting
Information. For LFAs run with NeutrAvidin PLNPs, ratios of
the test line intensity to the control line intensity were calculated
for each strip, and the average intensity ratio and standard deviation
from 4 independent trials are shown in Figure 6C.9,10 Examination of the images in Figure 6B,C reveals that bHEL concentrations at or above
1 ng/mL are readily detectable. The no-target controls show modest
nonspecific binding of the phosphors at the test line. A one-tailed t test60 reveals that the difference
in the mean intensity ratio between the 0.1 ng/mL samples and the
no-target controls is statistically significant at α = 0.025,
with a p-value of 0.0057. The mean intensity ratio
of the 0.1 ng/mL samples is greater than 3 times the standard deviation
plus the mean of the no-target controls. The limit of detection for
LFAs run with PLNPs is therefore slightly below 0.1 ng/mL (7 pM),
approximately an order of magnitude more sensitive than the Streptavidin
gold nanoparticles.

bound to
bHEL captured by anti-HEL antibodies. (B) LFA strips showing bHEL
serial dilutions with duplicates and detection with Streptavidin gold
nanoparticles (top) and NeutrAvidin PLNPs (bottom). (C) Average intensity
ratios (Itest line/Icontrol line) and ± standard deviations at different
bHEL concentrations from LFA experiments with NeutrAvidin PLNPs (n = 4).

Despite the low limit
of detection, there is still a small but
observable amount of luminescence from PLNPs bound at the test line
in the no-target controls. It is conceivable that the background could
be reduced and a lower limit of detection achieved using alternate
surface modification strategies that result in lower nonspecific binding61 or further optimization of the PEG grafting
protocols.62 The gel imager and UV illumination
system used for readout of the PLNP LFAs is not optimized for time-resolved
photoluminescence and is not ideal for point-of-care testing. However,
various point-of-care reader designs could be implemented to have
a shorter, better-controlled time delay between excitation and imaging,
which could improve the limit of detection by increasing the luminescence
signal while decreasing its variability between assays. Light detection
with a photomultiplier tube or avalanche photodiode instead of a digital
camera for readout could also increase the analytical sensitivity.
The nanoparticles used in the present work are relatively large and
polydisperse compared to typical LFA reporters. Future work may lead
to smaller, more monodisperse PLNPs that also possess the luminescence
properties necessary for sensitive in vitro diagnostics.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated LFAs based on persistent
luminescence strontium
aluminate nanoparticles. The particles are highly photostable, and
the silica shell preserves the luminescence properties by preventing
hydrolytic degradation. Surface functionalization of the particles
can be achieved using standard methods and could readily be extended
to bioconjugation of antibodies, nucleic acids, or other biomolecules
for the detection of various analytes. We demonstrated that the particles
can be used in LFAs for rapid detection with high sensitivity without
continuous excitation. The long luminescence lifetime can potentially
alleviate design constraints on point-of-care diagnostic devices by
eliminating the need for optical filters required for fluorescence
measurements and also offers the advantage of reduced background autofluorescence
when the particles are used in a time-resolved manner. Future work
with phosphorescent strontium aluminate and other persistent luminescence
materials could lead to a new class of reporters for diagnostics and
environmental monitoring.
