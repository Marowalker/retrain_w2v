Currently,
there is a severe shortage of donor kidneys that are
fit for transplantation, due in part to a lack of adequate viability
assessment tools for transplant organs. This work presents the integration
of a novel wireless two-channel amperometric potentiostat with microneedle-based
glucose and lactate biosensors housed in a 3D printed chip to create
a microfluidic biosensing system that is genuinely portable. The wireless
potentiostat transmits data via Bluetooth to an Android app running
on a tablet. The whole miniaturized system is fully enclosed and can
be integrated with microdialysis to allow continuous monitoring of
tissue metabolite levels in real time. We have also developed a wireless
portable automated calibration platform so that biosensors can be
calibrated away from the laboratory and in transit. As a proof of
concept, we have demonstrated the use of this portable analysis system
to monitor porcine kidneys for the first time from organ retrieval,
through warm ischemia, transportation on ice, right through to cold
preservation and reperfusion. The portable system is robust and reliable
in the challenging conditions of the abattoir and during kidney transportation
and can detect clear physiological changes in the organ associated
with clinical interventions.

==== Body
Kidney transplantation
is the
optimal treatment for patients with end-stage kidney disease. However,
there is a huge shortage of donor kidneys worldwide; according to
the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, there are currently
94,755 patients waiting for a kidney transplant in the United States
alone and in 2018 only 21,167 kidneys transplants were carried out.1 As a result, there is a critical need to increase
the pool of available donor organs.

The majority of kidney transplants
use organs from deceased donors,
predominantly from donation-after-brain-death (DBD) donors, whose
hearts were beating prior to retrieval as ischemic damage should be
limited. However, with the need to increase the donor pool, there
is considerable interest in reducing the discard rate of marginal
organs, such as those from donation-after-cardiac-death (DCD) donors
and expanded criteria donors (ECD). DCD organs tend to be under-utilized
as there is a period of prolonged warm ischemia that can cause the
organ not to function in the initial period following transplantation
(delayed graft function).2−4 ECD organs, such as those from
donors who are aged 60 years and older or who do not meet specifically
defined criteria,5 are at a higher risk
of graft failure;5 however, these transplants
have been shown to be beneficial compared with the alternative of
chronic dialysis treatment.6

In order
to decrease the discard rate of these marginal donor organs
and hence increase the number of organs available for transplantation,
there is an urgent need to improve organ viability assessment prior
to transplantation so that organs that are at risk of poor outcomes
can be identified early. Currently, organs are accepted or discarded
based on subjective evaluation of donor characteristics and macroscopic
kidney assessment only.7 A move toward
a more quantitative measure will aid in clinical decision-making and
could substantially increase the use of marginal donor organs. Moreover,
better viability assessment could allow better evaluation of novel
preservation methods to recondition marginal organs.

Real-time
chemical monitoring can provide time-critical information
on tissue health in a clinical setting.8 Microdialysis is a tissue sampling technique that uses a small (typically
600 μm diameter) probe with a semipermeable membrane at the
tip. The inside of the membrane is perfused at a low flow rate (0.1–2.0
μL/min), which sets up a concentration gradient across the membrane
between the extracellular fluid and the probe, creating a dialysate
stream that is representative of the tissue concentrations of analytes.
This sampling technique can be coupled with high-resolution analysis
techniques for in vivo monitoring.9−16 Our research groups have previously demonstrated that using online
microdialysis to measure levels of glucose and lactate can be used
to provide information on the metabolic state of transplant organs
ex vivo and can detect metabolic differences between organs.17 However, in this previous work, the analysis
system was housed on a large clinical trolley and was therefore only
suitable for lab-based monitoring. This meant that it was not possible
to monitor the organs during the crucial stages immediately after
retrieval. As a first step toward portable monitoring, attempts were
made to collect the dialysate in fine-bore tubing to be played back
later.18 Although this enabled measurement
of dialysate levels, the data was not obtained in real time.

A portable miniaturized analysis system that can be taken to the
donor site to monitor tissue metabolism during the initial stages
of ischemia and that can travel with the transplant organ to the recipient
site would allow clinicians to track the health of the organ in real
time from retrieval right through to transplantation. Microfluidics
are ideally placed to reliably handle the low fluid volumes generated
by microdialysis with high time resolution.9−11,19−23 Our group has developed a 3D printed microfluidic chip that is extremely
robust and reliable when coupled with microdialysis for clinical monitoring.10

In this study, we describe the development
of a miniaturized wireless
portable analysis system for continuous measurement of dialysate glucose
and lactate levels in real time. The analysis system incorporates
our established microneedle-based biosensors9,11 and
3D printed microfluidic chip10 and integrates
them with a novel two-channel wireless potentiostat to form a compact
monitoring system. For this study, we have also made our autocalibration
system19 wireless and portable so that
biosensors can be calibrated in transit, ensuring that the system
is ready to use on arrival. Here we show the use of continuous online
microdialysis to measure tissue metabolite levels in real time in
kidneys during the critical time period of organ retrieval for the
first time, as well as during organ preservation, organ reperfusion,
and simulated transplantation, demonstrating a robust and reliable
analysis system for portable sensing applications.

Experimental
Section
Reagents
Glucose oxidase (GOx) from Aspergillus niger and lactate oxidase (LOx) from Aerococcus viridians were purchased from Sekisui
Diagnostics. Polyurethane (Texin 985) was obtained from Bayer. Other
reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.

Electrode Fabrication
The biosensors used in this work
are fabricated based on a combined needle electrode, which has been
described in detail elsewhere.24,25 Briefly, a 50 μm
diameter platinum/iridium (90%:10%) wire insulated with polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE, coating thickness 0.0125 mm Advent Research Materials) and
a 50 μm silver wire insulated with polyester (coating thickness
0.0075 mm, Goodfellow) were threaded through a 27G hypodermic needle.
The insulation layer was removed from the ends of the wires using
a small flame to expose the metal, and the ends of each wire were
connected to an electrical wire using conductive silver epoxy glue
(RS Components). Epoxy resin (Robnor resins, CY1301 and HY1300) was
used to fill the needle and to secure the wires in place. Once the
epoxy resin was cured, the bevel of the needle was sanded down using
sandpaper (Buehler) to create silver and platinum disc electrodes.
The blunt needle was then polished sequentially with alumina slurries
(1, 0.3, and 0.05 μm). Finally, in order to create the Ag|AgCl
reference electrode, the tip of the needle was dipped into a potassium
dichromate reference solution (BASi) for 3 s and then into a solution
of 1.2 M hydrochloric acid for 20 s to remove the oxide layer from
the working and counter electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry in 1.5 mM ferrocene
monocarboxylate solution (Fc) was used to assess the working electrode
surface.

Biosensor Fabrication
Glucose and lactate biosensors
were fabricated in several layers as described previously.9,11 (i) First, the working electrode was coated with poly(m-phenylenediamine)
(mPD) using electropolymerization to screen out potential interferences.
This was done by placing the needle electrode in a 100 mM solution
of the m-phenylenediamine monomer in 10 mM PBS at pH 7.4. The working
electrode potential was held at 0 V for 20 s, +0.7 V for 20 min to
initiate electropolymerization, and finally 0 V for 3 min to stabilize
the film. The electrode was gently rinsed with deionized water, and
the presence of the film was verified with cyclic voltammetry in Fc
solution. (ii) After successful electropolymerization of the screening
layer, the electrodes were dipped into the enzyme solution; for lactate
biosensors this was 60 mg/mL LOx, 30 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA),
2% v/v glycerol, and 45.6 mg/mL poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether
(PEG-DE) in 10 mM PBS pH 7.4, and for glucose biosensors this was
60 mg/mL GOx, 30 mg/mL BSA, 1% v/v glycerol, and
14.8 mg/mL PEG-DE in 10 mM PBS pH 7.4, adapted from the method described
by Vasylieva et al.10,27 The needles were placed in the
oven at 55 °C for 2 h to cross-link the hydrogel layer. During
operation, a potential of +0.7 V was applied to the working electrode
to drive the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide produced by the reaction
of the substrate with the enzyme. (iii) Finally, following enzyme
immobilization, biosensors were coated with a solution of polyurethane
(Texin 985, Bayer) in tetrahydrofuran by dip coating to provide a
diffusion-limiting layer and hence to extend their dynamic range.9 The sensors were allowed to dry at room temperature
and then stored at −20 °C until use.

Microfluidic
Analysis Platform
Biosensors were housed
in a 3D printed chip, described in detail elsewhere.10 Briefly, the 3D printed chip was fabricated in ABS White
resist using an ULTRA 3SP printer. Biosensors were placed inside electrode
holders,9,10 which were printed using an Objet260 Connex
printer that can print both hard and soft material in the same component.
VeroWhitePlus (RGD835) and TangoBlack (FLX973) were used for the hard
and soft materials, respectively. All parts were printed based on
drawings generated in SolidWorks.

Wireless Recording Instrumentation
A wireless potentiostat
and a data-recording mobile app were developed specifically for this
application. The wireless potentiostat was implemented on a 2-layer
printed circuit board (PCB) designed in-house using Eagle and manufactured
by Newbury Electronics. The electronic components were purchased from
Farnell and Mouser and were assembled onto the PCB in house, using
the reflow soldering process. The PCB was powered by a small (50 ×
37 × 10 mm3) 3.7 V rechargeable lithium-ion battery
(1.8 Ah, BAK). Data output by the potentiostat was digitized by the
internal 10-bit analogue-to-digital converter of a microcontroller
(ATmega328, Atmel) and sent using a Bluetooth module (Bluefruit EZ-Link,
Adafruit) via serial communication. The schematics of the wireless
potentiostat PCB is given in Figure S1.
The recording mobile app was coded in Java using Android Studio and
deployed on a SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A 9.7” tablet.

Portable Calibration
Platform
Biosensors were calibrated
inside the microfluidic chip using the portable autocalibration board
shown in Figure 1.
This board was developed based on the microfluidic platform described
elsewhere.19 For this application, a wireless,
battery-powered version of the system was developed. The autocalibration
board consists of two 20 μL programmable syringe pumps (SPS01–020
LabSmith), one containing a glucose standard solution and the other
a lactate standard solution. By mixing the two flows and varying the
relative flow rates, a multipoint calibration can be carried out while
keeping the overall flow rate constant at 2 μL/min. The pumps
are each connected to a valve and a reservoir containing 1 mL of the
solution. This allows the pumps to be continually refilled after each
calibration cycle. To allow for wireless control of the autocalibration
board, a wireless controller PCB was developed to plug into the board.
The PCB was designed in-house using Altium and manufactured by Newbury
Electronics. The complete board was assembled in-house. The wireless
calibration controller PCB was mounted with a microcontroller (ATmega328,
Atmel) and a Bluetooth module (Bluefruit EZ-Link, Adafruit) that received
orders sent by a control mobile app developed specifically for this
application. It was powered through the calibration board using a
rechargeable 12 V lithium-polymer battery (20 Ah, Anker). The schematic
of the wireless calibration controller PCB is given in Figure S2. The control mobile app was coded in
Java using Android Studio and deployed on the same SAMSUNG Galaxy
Tab A 9.7” tablet that runs the recording app. During sensor
calibrations, both apps were run simultaneously. For ex vivo experiments,
the sensors were continuously calibrated during the journey to the
abattoir (typically 2 h). When the kidneys had been brought back to
the laboratory, the sensors were calibrated again.

Figure 1 (A) Portable setup for
monitoring transplant kidneys in transit.
The analysis system consists of needle-based amperometric glucose
and lactate biosensors controlled by a wireless two-channel potentiostat
that transmits data to a tablet via Bluetooth. The signals recorded
at the biosensors are transmitted and displayed on the tablet screen
in real time using a custom-written Android app. The biosensors are
inserted in the channel of a 3D printed microfluidic chip (see cross-section
zoom-in) using 3D printed holders. The microfluidic chip is alternately
connected to a portable calibration system (calibration mode) or to
the outlet of a microdialysis probe that samples the kidney extracellular
fluid (analysis mode). (B) Picture of the setup in calibration mode.
The blue circle shows the wireless calibration controller PCB. (C)

cold flushing with preservation solution (photo used as an example
in of in vivo clinical monitoring in ref (17). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry).

Kidney Protocol
The protocol for
porcine kidney monitoring
using microdialysis has been described in detail elsewhere.28 A MAB 11.35.4 microdialysis probe (Microbiotech,
4 mm membrane, 6 kDa molecular weight cutoff) was used to monitor
each kidney. In each case the probe was perfused prior to insertion
and after removal at the end of each experiment to check for any blockages
or leakages and to verify that the probe was functioning correctly
during the whole monitoring period. The probes were perfused with
T1 physiological solution (2.3 mM calcium chloride, 147 mM sodium
chloride, 4 mM potassium chloride) at 2 μL/min using a portable
syringe pump (CMA107 MDialysis). The outlet of the microdialysis probe
was extended using a 50 cm length of fluorinated ethylene propylene
(FEP) tubing (120 μm inner diameter) as this proved more practical
for later packing of the organ in an ice box. Once the pig had been
killed, the internal organs were removed and placed on a bench; a
microdialysis probe was immediately inserted into the cortex of each
kidney by a clinician and sutured in place (probes were in place approximately
5 min after the pig was killed). The outlet of each microdialysis
probe was connected to an analysis system to commence online monitoring.
The kidneys were then dissected away from the other internal organs
and left at room temperature for 40 min. This does not reflect a typical
clinical scenario; however, it allowed for tissue levels to stabilize
after probe insertion and for baseline measurements to be taken prior
to cooling the kidney. Importantly, the longer warm ischemia time
(WIT) used here also serves to more closely reflect more damaged kidneys
such as those retrieved from ECD or uncontrolled DCD.

Following
warm ischemia, the kidney was flushed with cold Soltran preservation
solution (Baxter) for around 20 min to cool the kidney and to clear
the vessels of blood to prevent clots from forming. After flushing,
the kidneys were placed in a bag containing the preservation solution
and in a box of ice to be transported back to the laboratory, which
took ∼2 h on average. The kidneys were monitored in real time
throughout the journey. Upon arrival in the lab, the kidneys were
stored in the fridge overnight at 4 °C.

The following day
the kidneys were preconditioned on a pulsatile
preservation machine (Waters Medical) to investigate the effect of
preservation treatments on tissue metabolite levels. The data from
the preservation stage presented here is from a kidney that was treated
with hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) for 4 h with Belzer-MPS University
of Wisconsin solution. Following the preservation stage, the kidneys
were reperfused with oxygenated whole autologous blood at 37 °C
for 2 h to mimic transplantation. Tissue glucose and lactate levels
were monitored throughout preservation using our wireless analysis
system. A total of six kidneys were monitored using this protocol.

Effect of Temperature on Microdialysis Sampling
For
one kidney, an experiment was carried out to investigate the effect
of temperature on microdialysis sampling. A second microdialysis probe
was inserted in the cortex of the kidney as described above. In this
case, the probe was perfused with an exogenous substance in order
to look at the effects of temperature on the probe within the tissue,
without introducing a substance that would interact with the tissue
metabolism; the probe was perfused with 0.5 mM Fc solution at 2 μL/min.
Monitoring the concentration of Fc in the dialysate at different temperatures
gives a measure of the extraction fraction and hence the diffusion
across the membrane.

The outlet of the probe was connected to
a 3D printed microfluidic chip containing a needle electrode coated
with a layer of hydrogel without enzyme (90 mg/mL BSA, 14.82 mg/mL
PEG-DE, 1% glycerol in 10 mM PBS) to limit potential interferences,
which was held at +0.5 V versus a Ag|AgCl reference electrode. The
concentration of Fc in the dialysate outflow was measured in real
time throughout the kidney preservation protocol on the second day,
described above. The kidney temperature was measured throughout using
a temperature probe (IT-14, Physitemp) connected to an in-house temperature
sensor so that it could be correlated with the measured extraction
fraction.

Results and Discussion
Portable Analysis System
The portable analysis system
was developed with the aim of monitoring tissue metabolite levels
in nonlaboratory settings and in particular in transit. This required
a robust miniaturized analysis system, securely incorporating glucose
and lactate biosensors and a wireless calibration system to calibrate
biosensors in transit. Figure 1A shows an overview of the components of the portable analysis
system.

The analysis system consists of a 3D printed microfluidic
chip housing glucose and lactate biosensors in 3D printed electrode
holders. The holders are designed to secure the sensors in the chip,
which is crucial for situations where the system moves around a lot,
and to precisely position the sensor tips in the middle of the flow-stream.10 Once the sensors have been fixed in holders,
which can be done in advance, they can be easily and reliably replaced
in the chip by a nonexpert, which is ideal for a clinical application.

A miniaturized two-channel wireless potentiostat was developed
to control the amperometric biosensors (see Figure S1). The potentiostat was implemented on a PCB, small enough
(3.5 × 5.1 cm2) to travel with the kidney. A voltage
difference of 0.7 V was applied between the working and reference
electrodes using a voltage follower. Each channel was implemented
with three different gain resistors (1, 5, and 10 GΩ) that could
be selected using a manual switch, enabling the user to match the
output current range to the biosensor response. This was particularly
important as dialysate metabolite levels vary significantly between
the different stages of the protocol. The potentiostat power was provided
by a 3.7 V rechargeable battery. Data was sent in real time over Bluetooth
to a custom-written Android app running on a tablet. The sampling
rate was set to 10 samples/s but could be customized as required;
the data was saved as soon as it was received by the tablet, and every
second an average of the previous 10 samples was plotted on the app.
This online filter could be customized by the user and meant that
changes in metabolite levels could easily be seen as they occurred,
even in high-noise environments.

As shown in Figure 1A the wireless potentiostat
was encapsulated in a 3D printed casing
to add protection. This was designed to secure both the potentiostat
and the 3D printed chip and sensors in place; it consisted of a compact
box (measuring 57 × 86 × 30 mm3) to contain the
potentiostat and a slot to hold the microfluidic chip. The lid incorporated
a window above the gain switches to allow access once the lid was
closed. This window was overlaid with a transparent waterproof cover
to ensure that the system was splash-proof, which was a crucial requirement
for use throughout surgery and in the abattoir. The microfluidic chip
containing the biosensors was held securely in place in the custom-made
slot providing a compact fully integrated system, ideal for monitoring
transplant organs.

In order to be able to calibrate the analysis
system away from
the laboratory and in transit, a wireless autocalibration system was
developed as shown in Figure 1B. The autocalibration system was made using LabSmith programmable
microfluidic components and set up to carry out multipoint calibrations.19 To implement a wireless version of this system,
the calibration board was powered via a rechargeable battery, and
a wireless calibration controller was developed to wirelessly control
the components via Bluetooth. The wireless calibration controller
interfaced with a custom-written Android app also running on the monitoring
tablet, which allowed the user to send commands to the PCB controlling
the autocalibration board by pressing buttons on the app graphical
user interface. This wireless calibration system meant it was possible
to calibrate the sensors on the way to the abattoir so that upon arrival
the analysis system was ready to use. Tubing was disconnected and
reconnected to switch between calibration and analysis mode (Figure 1B,C, respectively).

The whole system was validated in transit while traveling to the
abattoir to collect kidneys. It was packed in a bag and taken in a
taxi, on the train, and on the underground while automatically carrying
out repeated calibrations. An excerpt of data from this journey is
shown in Figure 2A
(for data from a 3 h long journey, see Figure S3); glucose and lactate biosensors were repeatedly calibrated
from 0 to 2 mM in four steps. No drop-out in the signal was seen,
and the system demonstrated high signal fidelity even in high-noise
environments, proving its suitability for clinical monitoring. The
corresponding calibration curves are shown in Figure 2B demonstrating the robustness and reproducibility
of the system in its true conditions of use. For calibration curves
of multiple biosensors, see Figure S4.

were generated repeatedly at 2 μL/min using the portable calibration
system: 0, 0.66, 1.34, and 2 mM for glucose and 2, 1.34, 0.66, and
0 mM for lactate. Data are shown for three consecutive calibration
cycles. (A) Online-recorded currents sampled at 10 Hz and smoothed
with a Savitzky–Golay 101-point filter. (B) Corresponding calibration
curves for each repeat, fitted with a straight line. Markers and error
bars represent mean and sd of 1 min measurements.

Continuous Kidney Monitoring in Transit
In a proof-of-concept
study to demonstrate the potential of this system for clinical monitoring
in transit, the portable analysis system was used to monitor tissue
glucose and lactate levels in porcine kidneys ex vivo in real time
during organ retrieval and in transit back to the laboratory. For
each pig, both kidneys were monitored using two portable systems (one
for each kidney).

A microdialysis probe was inserted into the
cortex of each kidney immediately after the internal organs had been
removed from the pig, as shown in Figure 3C(i). The cortex was chosen as we have previously
shown that it is the most metabolically active region.17 At this point, each analysis system was disconnected
from its calibration board and connected to the outlet of one of the
two microdialysis probes to commence online monitoring. The kidneys
were subjected to 40 min of warm ischemia at room temperature during
which time they were dissected away from the other internal organs.
After this time, they were flushed with a cold Soltran preservation
solution as shown in Figure 3C(ii). Finally, each kidney was placed in an ice box for transport
back to the laboratory. As the biosensors are functionalized with
enzymes, which have optimal working temperatures, and rely on diffusion
and chemical reactions to give a signal, their sensitivity is likely
to decrease if the temperature is lowered. To determine whether the
analysis system could be placed inside the ice box, experiments were
carried out to investigate whether this reduction in sensor sensitivity
caused by lowering the temperature was predictable; however, the effect
was found to be variable, and therefore, it would not be possible
to reliably account for this (see Figure S5). The low temperature was not found to have an effect on the analysis
system when it was placed outside the ice box as shown in Figure S6. Therefore, as shown in Figure 3C(iii), the analysis system
was instead placed outside of the ice box to avoid the cold temperatures
affecting the biosensor response.

during transit. (B) Dialysate glucose (red) and lactate (green) levels

with a Savitzky-Golay 201-point filter. Gray strips indicate the 2
min intervals at which the data was averaged to give the box plot
shown in (C). (C) Dialysate glucose (red) and lactate (green) levels

Box plots show median levels and interquartile range. Whiskers indicate
10th and 90th percentiles. Wilcoxon signed-rank test (lactate n = 6, glucose n = 5, as for one kidney
the glucose levels were so low they were indistinguishable from noise),
significance: *p < 0.05, NS = not significant.

Figure 3A shows
an example of continuous glucose and lactate dialysate levels measured
in a kidney from organ retrieval to transport back to the laboratory.
The microdialysis data has been time-aligned with clinical events.
A rise in levels of both glucose and lactate can be seen clearly upon
insertion of the microdialysis probe. The levels are initially changeable,
as the organs were being dissected, resulting in movement of the probe
in the tissue. During this time dialysate glucose levels were between
0.1 and 0.3 mM and lactate levels were between 0.8 and 1.9 mM. After
surgery on the organs was completed, the signals stabilized and gradually
decreased down to 50 μM for glucose and 500 μM for lactate.
A large transient increase in lactate and a small transient decrease
in glucose is seen when cold flushing of the organ begins. As the
changes are in opposite directions, this cannot be an artifact of
probe recovery.29 These changes are attributed
to the flushing of the organ causing redistribution of local lactate
to the probe from nearby tissue and glucose being flushed out. As
a result of cold flushing, levels of both metabolites decrease steeply
until they stabilize at 20 μM for glucose and 200 μM for
lactate. Upon placing the kidney in the ice box the levels continue
to gradually decrease, indicating that tissue metabolism is shutting
down due to the cold temperatures; after 30 min in the ice box, glucose
levels are below 12.2 μM (three times the standard deviation
(sd) of the signal). Despite the challenging environment of the abattoir,
using this robust analysis system we were able to measure metabolite
tissue levels during these crucial first stages of organ procurement
for the first time.

Six kidneys were monitored from retrieval
and in transit back to
the laboratory using our portable analysis system. Figure 3B shows a box plot summarizing
the dialysate glucose and lactate levels in these six kidneys at key
time-points during the monitoring period. The glucose signal for one
kidney was rejected as the glucose biosensor output was very noisy,
and the levels were indistinguishable from noise. The lactate levels
started high in all cases and decreased over the monitoring period.
Paired statistical analysis using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test shows
a significant decrease in the dialysate lactate concentration during
warm ischemia as well as when the kidneys were flushed with cold preservation
solution. Dialysate glucose levels also appear to decrease during
warm ischemia, although this change was not significant. During cold
storage, glucose levels were not distinguishable from zero, suggesting
a low energy supply to the tissue, or potentially high glucose use.
The low and stable lactate levels at the same time indicate that glucose
use is low, and the tissue was in a slow and well-regulated metabolic
state.

Monitoring Longer Clinical Interventions
Once the kidneys
had been brought back to the laboratory, they were stored in the fridge
overnight before preservation interventions were investigated the
following day. In some cases online kidney monitoring continued over
this period of cold storage, for a duration of 12 h. During this time,
dialysate glucose levels were below the detection limit of our monitoring
system. Dialysate lactate levels were also low and stable at 63 ±
9 μM (mean ± sd) over the 12 h time period. This further
indicates that at these temperatures tissue metabolism is slow and
well regulated.

The following day the kidneys were preconditioned
for 4 h on a perfusion machine. Following this preconditioning phase,
the kidneys were warm perfused with autologous whole blood to mimic
transplantation. Figure 4A shows an example of dialysate glucose and lactate levels during
the end of the preconditioning phase and during reperfusion for a
kidney that was preconditioned with HMP. There is a clear increase
in dialysate levels of both glucose and lactate when the kidney goes
from the cold preservation phase to reperfusion (from 0.12 ±
0.03 mM to 3.70 ± 0.46 mM for glucose and from 0.21 ± 0.03
mM to 2.41 ± 0.12 mM for lactate, mean ± sd on a 10 min
interval immediately before and after the start of reperfusion, corresponding
to a 30-fold and 11-fold increase, respectively). Whereas during HMP,
levels of glucose and lactate remained fairly constant, during reperfusion,
glucose levels slowly decrease while lactate levels slowly increase;
this indicates that tissue metabolism has resumed and the kidney is
respiring anaerobically in order to meet the increased energy demands
of the tissue. This demonstrates the potential of the analysis system
not just for monitoring situations that require portability but also
for monitoring clinical interventions taking place over multiple days.

Figure 4 (A) Dialysate
glucose (red) and lactate (green) levels recorded
from a kidney subjected to cold preservation and reperfusion with
autologous blood. Online data sampled at 10 Hz and smoothed with a
Savitzky-Golay 201-point filter. (B) Picture of a kidney with two
microdialysis (MD) probes inserted (one for metabolite sampling and
one for extraction fraction measurements) and a temperature probe
during HMP. (C) Fold increase in the microdialysis probe ex vivo Fc
extraction fraction (Ed) and in the lactate and glucose
dialysate concentrations due to the transition from cold preservation
to reperfusion. For glucose and lactate, mean values and sd (error
bars) are calculated over a 10 min interval (over 6000 data points)
immediately before and after the start of reperfusion and for Ed mean and sd are calculated over a 10 min interval for HMP
and reperfusion (over 6000 data points).

An increase in dialysate levels between the phases of HMP and reperfusion
is to be expected as the kidney is warmed, increasing recovery across
the membrane. An experiment was therefore carried out to investigate
whether this could explain the increased levels of glucose and lactate
seen in Figure 4A.
This was done using an exogenous compound, Fc, to make it possible
to distinguish the effect of temperature on diffusion within the tissue
and across the membrane from the effect on tissue metabolism and cellular
exchanges. In this experiment, Fc was perfused through a second microdialysis
probe positioned in the kidney as shown in Figure 4B. The concentration of Fc in the dialysate
was measured to calculate how much Fc had diffused out of the probe,
i.e., the extraction fraction. The rate of diffusion of Fc across
the membrane into the tissue can provide a first approximation of
the probe recovery from the tissue, although these parameters have
been shown not to be exactly equivalent.30−32Figure 4C shows the extraction fraction
during HMP and reperfusion. This data shows that the extraction fraction
increased from 6% during cold perfusion at 8 °C to 17% during
warm perfusion at 33 °C, corresponding to a 2.8-fold increase.
This is considerably less than the increase in metabolite levels seen
in Figure 4A, indicating
that although some of this increase will be due to an increase in
probe recovery, a large proportion of it is caused by physiological
changes in the tissue itself caused by the change in treatment.

Conclusion
We have demonstrated the first example of using
a portable analysis
system to monitor physiological levels of tissue metabolites in real
time from organ retrieval right through to preservation and during
transportation. We have demonstrated the capabilities of the analysis
system for measuring changes in the levels of glucose and lactate
in a kidney during each stage of organ procurement, from warm to cold
ischemia, and during preservation, indicating the huge potential of
this device for real-time monitoring and evaluation of transplant
organs as they are transported from donor to recipient hospitals.
Tissue concentrations of glucose represent a balance between supply
from the blood (or other perfusing media) and local tissue utilization
by metabolism. Tissue lactate concentration increases reflect lack
of oxygen, though ultimately they can become limited by glucose supply,
hence the need to measure both. These measurements in challenging
environments and in transit were made possible due to the portability
and robustness of the analysis system and due to the inclusion of
a portable calibration system. This miniaturized analysis system has
vast potential for use in other clinical microdialysis applications
where size, portability, and robustness are important considerations.
For instance, this analysis system would be ideal in a crowded theater
environment where the monitoring device must be compact and robust;
this system would remove the need for the long connection tubing that
is often required, which usually leads to long delays and loss of
temporal resolution.10,11 We have also demonstrated the
durability and reliability of the system in monitoring over multiple
days. Future work will focus on correlating these results with clinical
measurements of kidney function in order to establish markers of tissue
health and potential predictors of kidney viability. We are also investigating
surface probes with greater tissue coverage.
