α-Synuclein
fibrils are considered a hallmark of Parkinson’s
disease and other synucleinopathies. However, small oligomers that
formed during the early stages of α-synuclein aggregation are
thought to be the main toxic species causing disease. The formation
of α-synuclein oligomers has proven difficult to follow, because
of the heterogeneity and transient nature of the species formed. Here,
a novel bead-based aggregation assay for monitoring the earliest stages
of α-synuclein oligomerization, α-Synuclein–Confocal
Nanoscanning (ASYN-CONA), is presented. The α-synuclein A91C
single cysteine mutant is modified with a trifunctional chemical tag,
which allows simultaneous fluorescent labeling with a green dye (tetramethylrhodamine,
TMR) and attachment to microbeads. Beads with bound TMR-labeled α-synuclein
are then incubated with a red dye (Cy5)-labeled variant of α-synuclein
A91C, and EtOH (20%) to induce aggregation. Aggregation is detected
by confocal scanning imaging, below the equatorial plane of the beads,
which is known as the CONA technique. On-bead TMR-labeled α-synuclein
and aggregated Cy5-labeled α-synuclein from the solution are
quantitatively monitored in parallel by detection of fluorescent halos
or “rings”. α-Synuclein on-bead oligomerization
results in a linear increase of red bead ring fluorescence intensity
over a period of 5 h. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy
was performed on oligomers cleaved from the beads, and it revealed
that (i) oligomers are sufficiently stable in solution to investigate
their composition, consisting of 6 ± 1 monomer units, and (ii)
oligomers containing a mean of 15 monomers bind Thioflavin-T. Various
known inhibitors of α-synuclein aggregation were used to validate
the ASYN-CONA assay for drug screening. Baicalein, curcumin, and rifampicin
showed concentration-dependent inhibition of the α-synuclein
aggregation and the IC50 (the concentration of the compound
at which the maxiumum intensity was reduced by one-half) were calculated.

==== Body
Parkinson’s disease and
other synucleinopathies are characterized by the misfolding and aggregation
of α-synuclein. α-Synuclein is a small presynaptic protein
whose main function is believed to occur at the presynaptic terminals
and may play a role in regulating synaptic transmission.1 Its amino-acid sequence consists of three distinct
regions with different properties. The N-terminus,
which is defined by residues 1–60, contains an imperfect repeated
sequence (KTKEGV) involved in the amphiphilic α-helical structure
adopted when bound to lipids.2 The nonamyloid
component (NAC), region, which is defined by residues 61–95,
is highly hydrophobic and forms the core of the highly organized fibril
structures.3 The C-terminus,
which is defined by residues 96–140, is negatively charged
and contains several proline residues, making it very flexible. This
region is found to be unstructured in α-synuclein fibrils.4

α-Synuclein exists primarily as an
unfolded monomer in equilibrium
alongside some partially folded monomers and multimers, depending
on the local environments of the protein.5−8 In disease, α-synuclein
is believed to misfold, acquiring a conformation prone to aggregation
that leads to the formation of highly organized fibrils.9 The structure of mature fibrils have recently
been established in detail by solid-state NMR4 and cryo-EM10 to be Greek key-like. Fibrillation
of α-synuclein is described as occurring in three phases, similar
to the formation of other amyloid fibrils. The first stage of fibrillation
is called the nucleation or lag phase, where the protein undergoes a change in conformation that allows
the formation of small oligomers. The second phase is the elongation, in which the small oligomers rearrange into
a conformation with a greater β-sheet content, forming protofibrils
that subsequently elongate, forming the fibrils. The final phase is
the stationary phase, in which fibrils reach equilibrium
with the other α-synuclein species in solution.11 The kinetics of fibril formation are classically detected
by fluorescence emission intensity changes of solvatochromic dyes
such as thioflavinT, ThT, which exhibit enhanced fluorescence upon
binding to β-sheet-rich fibrils. α-Synuclein fibrils are
the species found to be the main components of Lewy bodies and Lewy
neurites in the brains of patients.11,12 However, early
oligomers, formed during the lag phase, are thought to be the main
toxic species in disease.13,14

To date, the
formation and structure of α-synuclein oligomers
have proven difficult to investigate, because of their transient state
and heterogeneous characteristics.15 The
shape, size, and conformation of various different oligomers, and
their kinetics of formation, have been described in the literature,
but a consensus on the most disease relevant species has not yet been
reached.15 Several groups have described
the existence of two different types of oligomers on the pathway to
fibril formation.16−19 The earliest oligomers detectable in the pathway have been shown
to be smaller and less compact than the subsequent ones. Some studies
have suggested that both types of oligomers are able to form fibrils,16,19 in disagreement with other studies that suggested that just one
of the oligomers is able to continue through to fibril formation.20 It is not known if these studies were describing
the same or different types of oligomer. Evidence of heterogeneity
of oligomers has been reported many times. The different nature of
these oligomers could explain the different fibrillation propensities.
To our knowledge, the kinetics of the full oligomerization process
has been quantified twice, both by single-molecule techniques. One
by direct measuring of the aggregation of labeled α-synuclein,20 and the other one by measuring ThT anisotropy.21 Both studies focus on the conformational changes
of the oligomers observed, describing the interconversion between
two different types of oligomers and not on the development of an
assay for HTS.

The variability of the oligomers formed could
potentially be explained
by the different experimental conditions used to induce the oligomerization
process. To date, it appears that no universal standard detection
method for oligomer formation has been established.15

This work describes a novel assay for monitoring
early α-synuclein
oligomerization on-bead, α-synuclein–confocal nanoscanning
(ASYN-CONA). On-bead screening is a well-validated screening technique
for the detection of the binding of small molecular entities synthesized
on bead to target proteins in solution.22−25 Confocal nanoscanning (CONA)
relies on the imaging of a monolayer of beads, using a scanning confocal
microscope focused below the equatorial plane of the beads and scanned
through the entire well, generating a cross section of the beads.26−28 When fluorescently labeled target protein is bound to the bead,
a “halo” or “ring” is observed. Bead-based
screening offers a series of advantages, including sensitivity, versatility,
miniaturization, statistical significance, and multiplexing. The advantages
of the bead-based screening platform have been exploited to develop
ASYN-CONA, which focuses on studying the early oligomerization process
of intrinsically unfolded proteins, exemplified with α-synuclein.

Materials
and Methods
All commercially available reagents were purchased
from Sigma–Aldrich
or VWR Scientific, unless otherwise stated, and used as received taking
the determined concentration after quality control by HPLC and LCMS.

Confocal
Imaging
Bead images were taken on an Opera
High Content screening system (PerkinElmer), using a 20× air
objective, NA 0.45, with a 384 well plate (SWISSCI, Code PS384B-G175)
and detection was performed by Peltier-cooled CCD cameras with 1.3
megapixel. The focal height was set to 30 μm above the well
plate surface. A three-exposure setup was used, all in camera 2 with
primary dichroic 445/561/640: exposure one, cw laser 561 nm, detection
dichroic 568sp for camera 2, filter 585/40; exposure two (bright-field),
top illumination, 50% LED, 160 ms exposure time, detection dichroic
650sp for camera 2, filter 690/70; and exposure three, cw laser 640
nm, detection dichroic 650sp for camera 2, filter 690/70. The specific
laser powers and exposures times are specified in each experiment.
The wells were imaged as 77 overlapping (20%) images over the entire
well area, avoiding the edges.

Stitching
Images
were stitched using Fiji software29 with
a batch stitching macro utilizing the ImageJ
plugin Grid/Mosaic stitching.30

Image
Analysis
Bead Ring Evaluation and Analysis of
Data software (BREAD), developed in Auer lab, was used for the analysis
of all image data (a manuscript describing BREAD in more detail is
in preparation). In brief, beads are individually detected in each
channel within a radius range defined by the number of pixels, here
between 60 and 110. Where images are dark, or beads nonfluorescent,
the bright-field channel is used to specify the location of beads
in the fluorescent image, so that they can still be included for analysis
to ensure correct statistical evaluation. Bead ring intensity is calculated
from n profiles taken from each bead. In the analysis
of the images in this project, n was always 10. The
maxima of the intensity profiles at the two edges of the beads were
averaged, and the 20th–80th percentiles of the profile intensity
between these two points was subtracted to account for the intensity
of the center of the bead. This number was referred to as the bead
ring intensity. Bead ring intensity from each bead is calculated as
the average of all the profiles of each bead. Mean bead ring intensity
of each well in each channel is calculated as the average ring intensity
of all the beads in the well. Ratiometric quantification was calculated
by dividing the ring intensity in two different channels on an individual
bead basis. Outlying beads (<5%) were deleted and not considered
for the quantification. Beads were considered to be outlying if a
bead was badly stitched or broken, when it was out of focus, when
no ring was observed under exposure one, or when the bead brightness
was at least 1 order of magnitude larger than average.

α-Synuclein
Aggregation Assay
Ni-NTA agarose
beads (Qiagen, No. 30250) were sieved manually using 120 μm
(Merck Millipore, No. NY2H04700) and 100 μm (Falcon cell strainer,
No. 352360) filters and beads with sizes between 100 μm to 120
μm were used for all of the on-bead experiments. Beads were
stored in 20% EtOH in water and washed prior to any experiment with
buffer (20 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.1) three times by removing supernatant
and adding more buffer and kept in a 50% slurry solution. Aliquots
of protein stored at −80 °C were defrosted and used on
the day. For the incubation of the α-synuclein-A91C-HTM with
the beads, 275 μL of protein solutions for final concentrations
of 0, 500, 200, 100, 50, and 25 nM were prepared and 25 μL of
50% slurry beads were added. The solutions were shaken at 1000 rpm
and 22 °C for 20 min and washed 3 times to remove any unbound
protein. Aliquots of 10 μL were taken and imaged at this stage.
For the aggregation assays, α-synuclein-A91C-Cy5 (500 nM final
concentration) and EtOH (0 for the control or 20% final concentration)
were added. The reaction was shaken at 1000 rpm for a maximum of 6
h at 22 °C. Aliquots of 20 μL were taken every hour and
imaged stitched and analyzed as described above: exposure one, 1500
μW and 120 ms; exposure two, LED 50% and 160 ms; exposure three,
1000 μW and 120 ms.

Elution of α-Synuclein Oligomers from
Beads
After
5 h of incubation of the beads (1 mL of 500 nM aS-A91C-HTM, 2.5 μM
aS-Cy5 and 20% EtOH) shaking at 22 °C, the supernatant was removed
and the beads washed 3 times with 20 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.1.
300 mM imidazole, 20 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.1 (100 μL) was
added to elute the oligomers from the beads. The solution was collected,
flash frozen, and stored at −20 °C until required.

Sample
Preparation for Single-Molecule TIRF
Microscope
coverslips were prepared as described in the Supporting Information. Eluted α-synuclein was diluted to a concentration
of 10 nM in 20 nm filtered buffer (20 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.1)
with 50 μM Thioflavin-T (Sigma–Aldrich. Product No. T3516)
(for single aggregate visualization by enhancement (SAVE) imaging),31 before being added to the poly-l-lysine
coated coverslip. Following 10 min of incubation, the coverslips were
rinsed three times with 20 nm filtered buffer (20 mM Tris, 100 mM
NaCl, pH 7.1), and imaged on the single-molecule total internal reflection
fluorescence (TIRF) microscope.

Single-Molecule Imaging
Single-molecule imaging was
performed using a custom-built, bespoke single-molecule TIRF microscope,
which restricts the illumination to within 200 nm of the sample slide.
The fluorophores were excited at either 405 nm (Thioflavin-T), 561
nm (TMR), or 638 nm (Cy5). Collimated laser light at wavelengths of
405 nm (Cobolt MLD Series 405-250 Diode Laser System, Cobolt AB, Solna,
Sweden), 561 nm (Cobolt DPL Series 561-100 DPSS Laser System, Cobolt
AB, Solna, Sweden), and 636 nm (Cobolt MLD Series 638-140 Diode Laser
System, Cobolt AB, Solna, Sweden) were aligned and directed parallel
to the optical axis at the edge of a 1.49 NA TIRF objective (CFI Apochromat
TIRF 60XC Oil, Nikon, Japan), mounted on an inverted Nikon TI2 microscope
(Nikon, Japan). The microscope was fitted with a perfect focus system,
which autocorrects the z-stage drift during imaging.
Fluorescence collected by the same objective was separated from the
returning TIR beam by a dichroic mirror (Di01-R405/488/561/635 (Semrock,
Rochester, NY, USA), and was passed through appropriate filters (405
nm: BLP01-488R-25 (Semrock, Rochester, NY, USA), 561 nm: LP02-568-RS,
FF01-587/35 (Semrock, Rochester, NY, USA), 638 nm: FF01-692/40–25
(Semrock, Rochester, NY, USA). The fluorescence was then passed through
a 2.5× beam expander and recorded on an EMCCD camera (Delta Evolve
512, Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA) operating in frame transfer mode
(EMGain = 11.5 e–/ADU and 250 ADU/photon). Each
pixel was 103 nm in length. Images were recorded with an exposure
time of 50 ms with 638 nm (∼50 W cm–1) illumination,
561 nm illumination (∼50 W cm–1), followed
by 405 nm excitation (∼100 W cm–1). The microscope
was automated using the open source microscopy platform Micromanager.

Testing Inhibitors Using the ASYN-CONA Assay
Selegiline,
curcumin, rifampicin, dopamine, baicalein, and nicotine were analyzed
by HPLC and LCMS prior to use. The experiments were performed as described
above. In more detail, the following conditions were applied. α-Synuclein-A91C-HTM
was used at 100 nM and α-synuclein-A91C-Cy5 was used at 500
nM. The compounds were dissolved in EtOH and added to a final concentration
of compound of 50 μM and 20% EtOH. Control samples with no compound,
no compound, and no α-synuclein-A91C-HTM or no EtOH were included
in the experiment. Imaging conditions were the same as described above.

For measurement of the concentration-dependent inhibition of baicalein,
curcumin, and rifampicin, the experiments were performed exactly the
same but with the addition of different concentrations of the inhibitors
dissolved in EtOH.

With regard to IC50 fitting, where
IC50 represents
the concentration of the compound at which the maxiumum intensity
(Imax) was reduced by one-half, the mean
bead ring intensity data were plotted using GraFit v7.0.3 (Erithacus
Software Limited).50 The standard IC50 equation in GraFit,  was used to perform
a four-parameter fit of
the data to obtain IC50 values for individual compounds,
where y is the observed mean bead ring intensity; Imax and Imin are
the maximum and minimum mean bead ring intensities, respectively;
IC50 is the concentration of the compound at which Imax was reduced by half; n is
the slope of the fit; and x is the compound concentration.

Results and Discussion
Attachment of α-Synuclein to Beads
A critical
requirement for the development of the bead-based α-synuclein
aggregation assay was the attachment of fluorescently labeled α-synuclein
to microbeads. For this purpose, a trifunctional chemical tag was
synthesized, enabling the simultaneous fluorescent labeling of the
protein and specific functionalization with a reactive group to attach
the protein to beads. The tag required three different functionalities:
a reactive group to covalently bind to the protein, a fluorophore,
and a specific group to bind to the beads (Figure 1). The functionalization was achieved by
a synthetic trifunctional tag (HTM, 1). The three functionalities
of the tag include a maleimide for protein labeling;32 a His6-tag for bead attachment, and tetramethylrhodamine
(TMR)33 dye for fluorescent properties
(Figure 1A). In brief,
HTM (1) was successfully synthesized using standard Fmoc
solid-phase peptide synthesis (see the Materials
and Methods section).

Figure 1 (A) Structure of the HTM trifunctional tag (1). The
tag consists of a His6-tag, for binding to Ni-NTA beads;
a fluorophore (TMR); and a protein linkage point (maleimide). (B)
The different steps required to attach the protein to the microbeads.
First, the protein is covalently modified with the trifunctional tag.
Subsequently, the functionalized protein is attached to microbeads,
which will be used in the ASYN-CONA assay.

Since α-synuclein lacks cysteine residues in its sequence,
a single cysteine mutation was generated to provide a specific reactive
point for protein functionalization via a maleimide. Single-cysteine
mutants of α-synuclein have been extensively used for its labeling
and have shown no effect on its behavior when the mutation is located
at the end of the NAC region or on the C-terminus
of the protein (residues 90–140).17,18,20,34−37 Thirunavukkuaras et al. have used solvatochromic dyes at different
positions in α-synuclein to study conformational changes during
aggregation.34 The conclusions provided
valuable information about regions of the protein in proximity to
each other at different stages of the aggregation process, allowing
the selection of labeling position that would have low impact on the
aggregation.

For ASYN-CONA assay development, a cysteine was
introduced in position
A91. Briefly, α-synuclein-A91C was expressed in E. coli and purified by acid precipitation, followed by anion exchange chromatography
(see the Materials and Methods section).

TMR was used as a dye, because of its optical stability and great
brightness. It is of critical importance for the assay quality that
the intensity of the TMR emission defines single bead loading by α-synuclein.

α-Synuclein-A91C was labeled with the trifunctional tag (1) and incubated with Ni-NTA agarose beads presieved to homogeneous
sizes (100–120 μm) to allow optimized ring detection
and quantification. Imaging of the TMR tagged on-bead α-synuclein
(α-synuclein-A91C-HTM) was performed on a PerkinElmer Opera
high-content screening system. The presence of protein on-bead was
observed through a fluorescent ring around each bead (Figure 2). The attachment of TMR-labeled
α-synuclein was shown to be concentration dependent (Figure 2). When the beads
were incubated with increasing protein concentrations the bead ring
intensities increased linearly as shown on Figure 2.

Figure 2 Ring intensity is linearly proportional to the
amount of α-synuclein-A91C-HTM
incubated with the beads. Mean bead ring intensity in the TMR channel
(λex = 561 nm, λem =
585/40 nm) is represented as a function of the concentration
of α-synuclein-A91C-HTM (0, 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 nM) used
for attachment to the Ni-NTA agarose beads. Fitted line (red) represents
linear regression of the data (R2 = 0.9984).
The two different data points for each concentration originates from
beads functionalized on the same day.

On-Bead Aggregation Assay
ASYN-CONA is performed on
microbeads to which TMR-labeled α-synuclein is attached as described
above. Aggregation is induced in the presence of Cy5-labeled α-synuclein
in solution (Figure 3). On-bead and aggregated α-synuclein are observed via the
fluorescence properties of the different dyes that form a fluorescent
halo on the bead surface. The oligomerization is quantified via the
increase of the fluorescent intensity of the bead rings.

Figure 3 ASYN-CONA,
a bead-based assay for α-synuclein aggregation.
Upper panel shows a schematic representation of the assay. Lower panel
shows example images acquired at different stages of aggregation.
In the image on the left, α-synuclein labeled with TMR (green)
is attached to the beads, which is observed as rings in fluorescence
emission channel for TMR. Cy5-labeled α-synuclein is added to
the solution but no bead rings are observed in Cy5 fluorescence emission
channel (red), because aggregation has not yet started. In the middle
image, upon treatment with an aggregation inducing agent, red rings
of Cy5-labeled α-synuclein begin to form around the bead. In
the image on the right, over time, α-synuclein aggregates increase
in size, leading to an increase in the fluorescence emission ring
intensity in the Cy5 channel.

α-Synuclein aggregation has often been described as
a very
heterogeneous process.15 Many aggregating
agents have been reported, such as metal ions,38,39 organic solvents,40,41 acidity,42,43 temperature,43 sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS),44 and liposomes.45 For the ASYN-CONA on-bead aggregation assay, 20% EtOH proved
to be the most reliable aggregation inducing agent.41 Various other experimental conditions were tried, but none
showed equally consistent results as EtOH. In the presence of DMSO,
inhomogeneous bead rings were observed but did not increase in intensity
over time (data not shown).

Following the attachment of the
TMR-labeled α-synuclein to
the microbeads, the aggregation of orthogonally labeled α-synuclein
with Cy5 can be monitored.

Beads were conjugated with α-synuclein-A91C-HTM
at different
concentrations (25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 nM) and examined by confocal
scanning microscopy. After this first step, α-synuclein-A91C-Cy5
(500 nM) and EtOH (20%) were added to the bead solutions to induce
aggregation of the Cy5-labeled α-synuclein on the TMR-labeled
α-synuclein on bead. The aggregation process was followed for
5 h while shaking. Aliquots of the beads were taken every hour and
imaged by confocal scanning. The images were taken in two different
fluorescent emission channels adapted to the fluorescent properties
of Cy5 (ex. 640 nm, em. 690/70 nm) and TMR (ex. 561 nm, em. 586/40
nm); and a bright-field channel (see the Materials
and Methods section). The bead images were then analyzed with
a custom-developed software known as Bead Ring Evaluation and Analysis
of Data (BREAD), for quantification of the bead ring intensities in
the different detection channels. BREAD detects the presence and locations
of beads in all fluorescent and bright-field channels, and then correlates
and combines them. This reduces the risk that insufficiently fluorescent
beads are excluded from the analysis. Intensity profiles (in this
study, 10) are defined from each bead through the bead diameter, and
the peak maxima of the profiles quantified and the bead interior fluorescence
subtracted. The average of the profiles is calculated to reveal the
individual bead ring intensity. The discrete bead ring intensities
of all beads in a well are then averaged to produce the mean bead
ring intensity in the well under study. Variable protein loading between
beads is corrected via calculation of the ratios between the two fluorescence
emission channels on a single-bead basis.

Two control experiments
were included. In the first control experiment,
the beads lacking preconjugated α-synuclein-A91C-HTM were exposed
to the aggregation mix described above, to observe any unspecific
interactions of the protein in solution with the beads in the presence
of EtOH (Figure 4,
black squares, 0 nM). The second control experiment was performed
following an identical protocol to the aggregation experiment described
above but in the absence of EtOH, to observe any noninduced aggregation
processes that might occur (Figure 4, red circles, no EtOH). Both control experiments showed
no increase of the mean bead ring intensity of Cy5, compared to the
experiments in the presence of both α-synuclein-A91C-HTM and
EtOH.

Figure 4 α-Synuclein-A91C-Cy5 aggregates in a linear manner. The plot
shows the mean bead ring intensity detected in the Cy5 emission channel,
representing the aggregated α-synuclein-A91C-Cy5 on the α-synuclein-HTM
conjugated beads. Different colors and symbols represent the different
concentrations of α-synuclein-A91C-HTM used to incubate with
the beads. The rate of increase of the mean bead ring intensity is
dependent on the concentration of the conjugated protein to the bead.
Lines represent a linear regression of the data (data shown in Table 1). Six independent
replicates of the experiment were performed in total, all of them
showing the reproducibility of the assay; for the sake of clarity,
only a single repetition of the experiment is shown, with the standard
deviation corresponding to the individual experiment. After incubation
of the beads with α-synuclein-A91C-HTM (500, 250, 100, 50, and
25 nM) and washing, α-synuclein-A91C-Cy5 (500 nM) and EtOH (20%)
were added to the beads and left shaking. Aliquots were taken at time
intervals for imaging and quantification.

Quantified bead ring intensities in the different detection
channels
correlate with the amount of the protein on the bead surface. As expected,
the bead ring intensity measured via the fluorescence emission intensity
detected in the TMR channel corresponding α-synuclein-A91C-HTM
conjugated to beads remains stable during the course of the experiment
(Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).
Over time, the bead ring intensity measured via the fluorescence emission
intensity detected in the Cy5 channel increases linearly, as shown
in Figure 4. This increase
of bead ring intensity represents the rate of α-synuclein-A91C-Cy5
aggregation onto bead-conjugated α-synuclein-A91C-HTM under
the experimental conditions. The apparent rates of α-synuclein-Cy5
aggregation were dependent on the concentration of α-synuclein-HTM
conjugated to the beads (see Figure 4, as well as Figure S2 in
the Supporting Information) in a concentration range tested between
25 nM and 500 nM of α-synuclein-A91C-HTM. When the ratio between
aggregated α-synuclein-A91C-Cy5 and on-bead α-synuclein-A91C-HTM
was ≥5:1 (500 nM and 100 nM, respectively), the aggregation
reaction followed a linear trend. At ratios of 1:1 or 2:1, the linear
dependency began to deviate from linearity, most likely due to the
depletion of available α-synuclein-Cy5 in solution. The mean
bead intensity of α-synuclein-Cy5 over time was fitted by linear
regression, as shown in Table 1.

a Results from the fitting of the
mean bead ring intensity in the Cy5 emission channel of data from Figure 4 for the different
concentrations of α-synuclein-A91C-HTM incubated with the beads,
using y = a + bx as a linear equation. At higher concentrations
of α-synuclein-A91C-HTM, the slope of the fit increases, and
the adjusted R2 decreases.

When the experiments were performed
at 1:1 and 1:2 ratios of protein
on bead to protein in solution, the observed aggregation rate is dependent
on both the α-synuclein aggregation itself and the depletion
of the protein in solution. On the other hand, in systems working
at higher ratios, 1:5 to 1:20, the effect of protein depletion on
the rate of α-synuclein aggregation rate is less significant,
and the aggregation kinetics appear to be linear.

Under the
experimental conditions examined here, the simplest model
to explain the linear on-bead aggregation requires that each α-synuclein
can only bind two other α-synuclein proteins (Figure 5A). In this model, the two
potential mechanisms include one in which the interaction site is
hampered by the bead on the α-synuclein-A91C-HTM and an alternative
in which it is not (Figure 5A(i) and (ii). The characteristic kinetics of formation would
differ only by changes in the gradient of the curve (Figure 5B). Any larger number of binding
surfaces on the α-synuclein would lead to a characteristic pattern
for aggregation corresponding to a geometric series (Figure 5B), which does not match the
observed results. A one-to-one binding event cannot be discarded ,
because it would also match the observed results. Another possible
explanation for the linear aggregation would involve unspecific binding
of α-synuclein-A91C-Cy5 to the microbeads. However, this model
does not correspond with the lack of increase in intensity as a function
of time when no α-synuclein-A91C-HTM was attached to the beads
(Figure 4, black squares,
0 nM).

Figure 5 Models of on-bead α-synuclein aggregation: (A) α-synuclein
is modeled to have two binding sites and the aggregation is shown
as a linear increase of the fluorescence of the Cy5 labeled α-synuclein
(bottom left) (i) one of the binding surfaces on α-synuclein-HTM
is hampered by the microbead, and (ii) both binding surfaces on α-synuclein-HTM
are exposed for aggregation); (B) α-synuclein is assumed to
have three binding sites and the aggregation is shown as an increase
in fluorescence intensity, following a geometric series (bottom right).
The graph shown as an inset in panel (B) is set to the same scale
as panel (A), for the sake of comparison. [Red features represent
Cy-5-labeled α-synuclein, and green features represent HTM-labeled
α-synuclein.]

In summary, the observed
linear increase of the aggregated protein,
ratios of ≥5:1 of in solution to on-bead α-synuclein,
indicates that the mechanism of early aggregation under these experimental
conditions might be more homogeneous and controlled than often assumed.
Further characterization of the species formed on-bead is required
to better understand the oligomerization mechanism detected under
these experimental conditions.

The comparison with previously
published results such as Munishkina
et al.41 represents a challenge due to
the different experimental conditions of the two systems. The results
described by Munishkina are based on the increase of fluorescence
of ThT upon binding to α-synuclein fibrils. It shows that the
aggregation follows a sigmodal curve with a short lag phase in the
presence of 20% EtOH. The 5 h time frame of the assay described here
encompasses the lag phase and the beginning of the increase of fluorescence
in the ThT, which correspond to the early aggregation of α-synuclein.
However, care must be taken when comparing the two results, since
different experimental conditions, such as concentration and temperature,
among others, change the aggregation properties substantially.15

Two other α-synuclein mutants, V3C
and I112C, were tested
using the same assay as for A91C. Both α-synuclein mutants showed
a linear aggregation process (data not shown), but with slightly different
rates. The changes in the rate could be due to different aggregation
propensities of the mutants, the relative position of the dyes, or
other factors. However, the linearity observed is unaffected by the
position of the mutation. The effect of position of the mutations
is under further study and will be part of future research.

Imaging
of Oligomers by Single-Molecule Total Internal Reflection
Fluorescence (TIRF) Microscopy
Single-molecule total internal
reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy has previously been used
to study the aggregation of α-synuclein.31,46,47 Utilizing the different fluorescent wavelengths
of the fluorophores used in the assay (TMR and Cy5), it is possible
to measure their oligomerization by observing the coincidence of the
two α-synuclein species. In this study, aggregated on-bead α-synuclein
(both HTM and Cy5 labeled) was eluted and imaged (Figures 6A–C). The coincidence
between TMR (λex = 561 nm) and Cy5 (λex = 638 nm) indicates the presence of an oligomer, which are visible
as yellow spots in Figure 6B and are highlighted in Figures 6D–F, in which only the coincident
spots are shown. The association quotient, Q (see
data analysis in the Supporting Information) is a measure of the level of coincidence of the two species. For
these samples, Q = 0.090 ± 0.007 (mean ±
S.D., n = 3), indicating that 9% of the Cy5 species
detected were within a dual-labeled oligomer. By measuring the total
brightness in each channel and comparing this with the mean brightness
of the individual TMR or Cy5 fluorophores, the number of monomer units
of each α-synuclein species in the oligomers can be calculated.
The result from this calculation is a 6 ± 1 ratio of Cy5 to TMR
monomer units, shown in the contour plot in Figure 6G. The sizes and natural logarithms of the
stoichiometries of the detected oligomers are represented in the histograms
in Figure 6H and Figure S3 in the Supporting Information, respectively.

TIRF microscopy images of α-synuclein released
from the beads. Following incubation with imidazole, the α-synuclein
attached to the surface of the beads was eluted and imaged at the
single-molecule level. The HTM labeled α-synuclein and Cy5 labeled
α-synuclein in the same field of view are shown in panels (A)
and (C), respectively. The two channels are merged to give panel (B),
in which coincident spots corresponding to oligomers are clearly visible
(shown in yellow). Panels (D) and (E) show the same fields of view
in which only the coincident spots are shown in the HTM and Cy5 channels,
respectively. Panel (E) shows a map of the oligomers detected. (G)

and HTM monomers present in each detected oligomer. (H) Size histogram

As described previously, ThT is
able to bind to amyloid structures,
leading to an increase in its fluorescence intensity by several orders
of magnitude, making it an unusually sensitive and efficient reporter
of extended β-sheet structure. It has previously been used with
TIRF microscopy to detect individual aggregates within biofluids (single
aggregate visualization by enhancement (SAVE) imaging).31 In order to gain some insights into the secondary
structures of the on-bead oligomers, ThT was used to determine whether
any of the oligomers contained extended β-sheet structure. The
majority of oligomers detected were not ThT-active, indicating that
they are early aggregates in the fibril-formation pathway, as expected
from the assay conditions. In 1.8 ± 0.9% (mean ± S.D., n = 3) of the cases, however, there was enough extended
β-sheet structure for the oligomers to be detected using ThT
(see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information),
highlighting that some of the oligomers have become more fibril-like.17,31

α-Synuclein Aggregation Inhibitors
The objective
of this work was to develop an assay that (a) would allow monitoring
of the earliest stages of oligomerization of α-synuclein, rather
than later stage aggregation, and (b) is suitable for drug screening.
The ASYN-CONA assay has demonstrated novel mechanistic insights into
a so far undescribed oligomerization event. Given that the assay is
reasonably miniaturized and fast, it was concluded that, in a next
step, it could be investigated as a screening platform to find novel
α-synuclein aggregation inhibitors. In order to validate ASYN-CONA
as a screening method, several known inhibitors of α-synuclein
aggregation were tested. Selegiline,48 curcumin,49,50 rifampicin,49,51 dopamine,52,53 baicalein,54,55 and nicotine56,57 were the natural products chosen to investigate their inhibitory
properties under the assay conditions described above. The on-bead
aggregation experiment was performed in the same way as previously
described with the compounds dissolved in EtOH and added to the solution
containing the beads with conjugated α-synuclein-A91C-HTM and
in solution α-synuclein-A91C-Cy5. The aggregation of α-synuclein
in the presence of the inhibitors was followed as described above.

Figure 7 shows the
mean bead ring intensity and the ratio, representing the amount of
aggregated α-synuclein-A91C-Cy5 onto on-bead α-synuclein-A91C-HTM
after 5 h of incubation with inhibitors. At a compound concentration
of 50 μM, only curcumin, baicalein, and rifampicin showed significant
inhibition of α-synuclein aggregation. Most of the natural products
used in the assay have been described in the literature to induce
the formation of small nontoxic α-synuclein oligomers. α-Synuclein
aggregation has also been described as being very dependent on the
experimental conditions. The lack of an inhibitory effect of selegiline,
dopamine, and nicotine, compared to other published results, could
be due to the detection of early small oligomers with the ASYN-CONA
assay, rather than the detection of larger oligomers common in other
assays. Dopamine, selegiline, and nicotine may have more inhibitory
properties on an alternative aggregation pathway than that observed
on bead.

Figure 7 Activity of α-synuclein aggregation inhibitors assessed using
ASYN-CONA: (A) mean bead ring intensity quantified from the Cy5 fluorescence
detection channel and (B) ratio of the Cy5 fluorescence intensity
to the TMR fluorescence intensity. First, Ni-NTA agarose beads were
incubated with α-synuclein-A91C-HTM (100 nM), shaken for 20
min at 22 °C, and washed. α-Synuclein-A91C-Cy5 (500 nM)
and the inhibitor (50 μM) in EtOH (20%) were added to the solution
and the beads incubated for 5 h. One aliquot was taken after 5 h for
imaging and fluorescence intensity quantification. Three controls
with, respectively, no on-bead α-synuclein-A91C-HTM, no EtOH,
or no inhibitor present in the reaction sample were also included
in the assay. All experiments were performed in duplicate, and the
full experiment was repeated twice. The bars in graphs represent the
average weighted by the number of beads of the four repetitions.

As a next step, the concentration
dependence of the inhibitory
activity of the three active compounds (baicalein, curcumin, and rifampicin)
was assessed. The experiments were performed as described above. In
brief, beads with conjugated α-synuclein-A91C-HTM were incubated
with α-synuclein-A91C-Cy5 to which either baicalein, curcumin,
or rifampicin dissolved in EtOH was added at different concentrations.
All three compounds showed concentration dependent inhibition of aggregation
(Figure 8). Using the
equation   for curve fitting,
where y is the observed mean bead ring intensity, Imax and Imin are
the maximum and
minimum mean bead ring intensities, respectively, IC50 is
the concentration of the compound at which Imax was reduced by half, n is the slope of
the fit, and x is the compound concentration, the
IC50 for curcumin was determined to be 2.76 ± 0.89
μM, the IC50 for baicalein was 4.32 ± 0.60 μM,
and the IC50 for rifampicin was 502.32 ± 360.36 μM.

curcumin, and rifampicin inhibit aggregation of α-synuclein
in a concentration-dependent manner, as determined using ASYN-CONA.
Mean bead ring intensity in the Cy5 fluorescence emission channel

of curcumin, baicalein, and rifampicin. First, Ni-NTA agarose beads
were incubated with α-synuclein-A91C-HTM (100 nM), shaken for
20 min at 22 °C, and washed. α-Synuclein-A91C-Cy5 (500
nM) and the inhibitor (baicalein, curcumin, or rifampicin), at different
concentrations in EtOH (20%), were added to the solution and the beads
were incubated for 5 h. One aliquot (20 μL) was taken after
5 h, for imaging and quantification. Three controls with, respectively,
no on-bead α-synuclein-A91C-HTM, no EtOH, and no inhibitor were
also included in the assay. The data show the average intensity values
weighted by the number of beads of six repetitions. The blue lines
represents the fit to the full four-parameter equation for IC50 determination, y = (Imax – Imin)/[1 + (x/IC50)n] + Imin.
