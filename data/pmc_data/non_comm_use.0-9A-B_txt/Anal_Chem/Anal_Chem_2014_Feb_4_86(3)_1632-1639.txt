Studies
of isotopically labeled compounds have been fundamental
to understanding metabolic pathways and fluxes. They have traditionally,
however, been used in conjunction with targeted analyses that identify
and quantify a limited number of labeled downstream metabolites. Here
we describe an alternative workflow that leverages recent advances
in untargeted metabolomic technologies to track the fates of isotopically
labeled metabolites in a global, unbiased manner. This untargeted
approach can be applied to discover novel biochemical pathways and
characterize changes in the fates of labeled metabolites as a function
of altered biological conditions such as disease. To facilitate the
data analysis, we introduce X13CMS, an extension of the
widely used mass spectrometry-based metabolomic software package XCMS.
X13CMS uses the XCMS platform to detect metabolite peaks
and perform retention-time alignment in liquid chromatography/mass
spectrometry (LC/MS) data. With the use of the XCMS output, the program
then identifies isotopologue groups that correspond to isotopically
labeled compounds. The retrieval of these groups is done without any
a priori knowledge besides the following input parameters: (i) the
mass difference between the unlabeled and labeled isotopes, (ii) the
mass accuracy of the instrument used in the analysis, and (iii) the
estimated retention-time reproducibility of the chromatographic method.
Despite its name, X13CMS can be used to track any isotopic
label. Additionally, it detects differential labeling patterns in
biological samples collected from parallel control and experimental
conditions. We validated the ability of X13CMS to accurately
retrieve labeled metabolites from complex biological matrices both
with targeted LC/MS/MS analysis
of a subset of the hits identified by the program and with labeled
standards spiked into cell extracts. We demonstrate the full functionality
of X13CMS with an analysis of cultured rat astrocytes treated
with uniformly labeled (U-)13C-glucose during lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) challenge. Our results show that out of 223 isotopologue groups
enriched from U-13C-glucose, 95 have statistically significant
differential labeling patterns in astrocytes challenged with LPS compared
to unchallenged control cells. Only two of these groups overlap with
the 32 differentially regulated peaks identified by XCMS, indicating
that X13CMS uncovers different and complementary information
from untargeted metabolomic studies. Like XCMS, X13CMS
is implemented in R. It is available from our laboratory website at http://pattilab.wustl.edu/x13cms.php.

==== Body
The use of
isotopically labeled
compounds has yielded numerous important insights into the workings
of cellular and organismal metabolism.1 These have generally been gained through analysis of the patterns
and kinetics of label incorporation into specific metabolites after
introducing isotopically enriched precursors to the biological system
of interest.2 For instance, a common experimental
design for metabolic pathway discovery is to monitor product compounds
for the incorporation of isotopes derived from labeled potential precursors.
A seminal example of this approach was the discovery of cholesterol
biosynthesis from acetate.3,4 Analogous experiments
examining the labeling patterns of downstream metabolites have revealed
key details of the Entner–Doudoroff pathway,5 the tricarboxylic acid cycle,6,7 the citramalate
pathway,8 the Calvin cycle,9 and the pentose phosphate pathway.10,11 It is worth emphasizing, however, that in all of these examples
only one or two metabolites were monitored at a time for isotope incorporation.

The historic focus on analyzing label enrichment in only a limited
number of metabolites is in part due to the availability of well-established
and robust methods to measure labeling in specific compounds.2 Although these experiments have proven invaluable
to advancing our understanding of cellular metabolism, recent developments
in untargeted metabolomic technologies have enabled comprehensive
metabolite profiling at the systems level.12 Through the use of LC/MS, it is now possible to detect thousands
of metabolite signals from the extracts of biological specimens in
a single analytical run. Critical to the development of this platform
have been advances in both MS instrumentation and informatic tools
for processing the large amounts of data that untargeted LC/MS experiments
generate. Software solutions for performing peak detection, retention-time
alignment, data annotation, and statistics have greatly increased
the feasibility of applying the untargeted metabolomic approach to
biological problems.13−17

We describe here an adaptation of the untargeted metabolomic
approach
to conduct isotopic labeling experiments in a more global, unbiased
manner than has traditionally been available. The core of the analytical
platform developed for this purpose is a software program called X13CMS, an extension of the widely used untargeted metabolomic
data analysis package XCMS.13,18,19 Application of the X13CMS workflow (Figure 1) allows investigators to track the fates of isotopically
labeled precursors without the need of prior knowledge about pathways.
To accomplish this, two biologically equivalent samples are prepared
and a labeled precursor is applied to one of them. The fraction of
the total precursor pool that exists in labeled form, as well as the
length of time over which the label is applied, is left to the investigator
to control, but generally should be set to ensure sufficient flux
of the label through the cells’ or tissues’ metabolic
pathways. After completion of the labeling protocol, replicates of
both unlabeled and labeled samples are processed with the user’s
choice of metabolite extraction and untargeted LC/MS profiling methods.
The raw LC/MS data are forwarded to XCMS for peak detection and retention-time
alignment, and the resulting table representing all detected putative
metabolites is forwarded to X13CMS. From this table, the
program retrieves groups of metabolite isotopologues; that is, it
identifies metabolites that have been enriched with isotopic labels
derived from the labeled precursor and groups them together by the
mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of the
completely unlabeled form of each metabolite. We define an “isotopologue”
as the set of all isotopomers of a compound containing a defined number
of labeled atoms. We call the distribution of ion intensity among
the different isotopologues of the group the “labeling pattern”
of the metabolite. The algorithmic details of the isotopologue retrieval
process are given in the X13CMS Processing section below.

Figure 1 X13CMS workflow. Samples representing control and perturbed
conditions are divided into two groups, with one receiving an isotopically
labeled substrate at a defined fraction of the total pool of that
substrate and the other receiving the same substrate in a completely
unlabeled or natural isotope abundance form. Metabolite extracts and
LC/MS profiling data are collected on all samples and processed through
XCMS to detect features and perform retention-time alignment. The
features tables representing unlabeled and labeled samples are then
paired off by biological condition and submitted to the getIsoLabelReport()
routine of X13CMS to detect features that have been enriched
for the isotope label. To compare labeling patterns between conditions,
the isotope labeling reports are processed with getIsoDiffReport().

In addition to tracking the fates
of labeled precursors, X13CMS also performs differential
labeling analysis to discover
changes in these fates that arise from perturbations such as disease,
genetic manipulation, or drug treatment. The analysis searches for
isotopologue groups that are either uniquely represented or differently
patterned in one biological condition versus another. This functionality
of X13CMS is analogous to the diffreport() routine of XCMS,
which identifies differentially regulated metabolites from untargeted,
nonlabeled profiling data.13 To demonstrate
the full capabilities of X13CMS, we studied control and
LPS-stimulated astrocytes with U-13C-glucose. Our results
reveal that integrating the untargeted metabolomic and isotopic labeling
paradigms uncovers additional leads for further metabolic studies
that are not available through either approach alone.

Experimental
Section
Cell Culture and Metabolite Extraction
All reagents
and solvents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise specified.
Immortalized rat astrocytes (American Type Culture Collection CRL-2005)
were grown to confluency at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in T25
flasks, using high-glucose DMEM (Gibco) containing 10% FBS and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). Isotopic labeling was achieved through
30 min treatments with media containing 4.5 g/L U-13C-glucose
(100% of the total glucose content; Cambridge Isotopes); parallel
cultures were treated with 4.5 g/L natural-abundance glucose. Simultaneous
to the introduction of the labeled substrate, subsets of both unlabeled
and labeled cultures were treated with LPS (added to culture media
to a final concentration of 1 μg/mL) for the duration of the
labeling protocol. Cells were then washed with phosphate buffer solution
and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade water, quenched
with 1 mL cold HPLC-grade methanol, scraped from the plate, and pelleted.
Pellets were dried on a SpeedVac and subsequently lyophilized. Dried
samples were weighed out and extracted as previously described,20 with the solvent volumes adjusted to maintain
a ratio of 1 mL of solvent per 1 mg of dried cellular material. The
final volume of reconstitution solvent was adjusted to 100 μL
per 1 mg of dried material. All cell-culture conditions (unlabeled
versus labeled, control versus LPS-stimulated) were sampled in triplicate.

LC/MS Analysis
Five microliters of each extracted sample
were injected onto a Luna Aminopropyl, 3 μm, 150 × 1.0
mm i.d. column (Phenomenex) with an Agilent 1200 series HPLC system.
The samples were kept at 4 °C in the autosampler and injected
onto a column maintained at room temperature. The column was used
in hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) mode with
the following buffers and linear gradients: A = 95%
H2O, 5% ACN, 10 mM ammonium hydroxide, 10 mM ammonium acetate,
pH 9.45; B = 100% ACN; 85% B from 0 to 7 min (min),
85% to 60% B from 7 to 27 min, 60% to 40% B from 27 to 32 min, and
40% to 20% B from 32 to 40 min. Mass spectrometry (MS) detection was
carried out on an Agilent 6520 Q-TOF in negative ESI (electrospray
ionization) mode with the following settings: gas temperature 325
°C, drying gas 5 L/min, nebulizer 15 psi, fragmentor 120 V, skimmer
65 V, capillary voltage −3500 V, and scan rate 1.06 spectra/s.
Tandem MS (MS/MS) analyses were carried out with identical ESI parameters,
and the following fragmentation and precursor ion selection settings:
collision energy 10 V, precursor isolation window 1.3 amu, and scan
rate 1.00 spectra/s.

Spiking of Labeled Standards
After
all cell extracts
had been analyzed, the remaining unlabeled LPS-stimulated samples
were pooled, and then divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was spiked
with U-13C-lactate to a final concentration of 50 μM
and alpha-15N-glutamine to a final concentration of 10
μM. The control and spiked aliquots were each analyzed twice
with the LC/MS protocol described above.

LC/MS Data Preprocessing
with XCMS
Agilent .d files
were converted to the mzXML format with msconverter.exe.21 All samples (unlabeled and labeled, control,
and LPS-stimulated) were analyzed together via a single call to xcmsSet(),
which performs peak detection and sets up the data for further processing,
including most importantly retention-time alignment. The designation
of sample-class identities within XCMS should indicate which samples
are unlabeled and which are labeled. The values for the parameters
used in each step of the XCMS analysis in the present work are listed
in Table 1.

X13CMS Analysis
The main functionality of
X13CMS is implemented in two routines, getIsoLabelReport()
and getIsoDiffReport(). The values for the parameters used in each
routine to analyze the astrocyte data described herein are listed
in Table 1.

getIsoLabelReport()
This routine identifies which peaks
in the LC/MS data are enriched for the isotopic label. The inputs
are (1) an xcmsSet object containing the grouped and retention time-aligned
peaks detected in both unlabeled and labeled samples, (2) the difference
in mass between the unlabeled and labeled isotopes (we define this
as the mass difference of the isotopic label, e.g., 1.00335 Da for 13C), (3) the mass of the unlabeled isotope (e.g., 12.00000
Da for 12C), and (4) three error tolerance parameters:
(i) the acceptable parts per million (ppm) error of the m/z measurements, (ii) the ion intensity of baseline
noise from the MS detector, and (iii) the retention-time window (RTwin)
within which all detected peaks are considered as coeluting. With
the use of the following procedure, the routine outputs a table listing
isotopologue groups with statistically significant enrichment of the
isotopic label: (1) the peak groups of the xcmsSet object are sorted
by their aligned retention times into overlapping bins of width RTwin;
the overlap is half of the bin width. (2) Within each bin, all possible
pairwise comparisons of peaks are conducted to determine which are
potential isotopologues of each other. The criteria for calling an
isotopologue pair are as follows (note: in the ensuing text, “base
peak” refers to the peak with the lower m/z value of the pair and “labeled peak” to
the higher m/z value): (a) The m/z difference k between
the base and labeled peaks must be a whole-number multiple of the
isotopic label mass difference to within the ppm error of the MS instrument,  where k* is the nearest whole
number to k, ε is the ppm error expressed as
a decimal, mb is the m/z of the base peak, and d is the
mass difference of the isotopic label. The derivation of these bounds
on k is shown in Figure 1 of
the Supporting Information. (b) Mean intensity of the labeled peak
must be less than that of the base peak in samples treated with the
unlabeled precursor. (3) The list of potential isotopologue pairs
is sorted into groups that each contain a single unlabeled peak and
all of that peak’s observed isotopologues. This is done by
grouping together all isotopologue pairs sharing a common base peak.
Pairs in which both the base and labeled peaks are labeled peaks for
a different base peak are discarded because they represent duplicate
information. (4) Each isotopologue group is tested for statistically
significant enrichment of the isotopic label in those samples generated
from treatment with the labeled precursor. The intensities of each
isotopologue within a group are normalized to the total ion count
of the group; these relative intensities are then compared between
the unlabeled samples and the labeled samples with a Welch’s t-test. As long as at least one isotopologue within the
group meets the user-defined p-value cutoff for significance,
the whole group is called as being enriched with the label and is
added to the output table. Additional quality-control measures include
discarding groups in which the completely unlabeled isotopologue has
a mean absolute ion intensity below baseline noise and those in which
the relative intensities of the base isotopologue are higher in the
labeled samples than in the unlabeled samples.

The output of
getIsoLabelReport() is described in further detail in Table 2.

getIsoDiffReport()
This routine
compares labeling patterns
between two different biological conditions and assigns significance
values to the observed differences. Its inputs are the tables of labeled
isotopologue groups produced by getIsoLabelReport() from samples representing
each condition. The groups are assigned into two categories: those
that appear only in one sample class or the other and those that appear
in both. Groups that appear only in one sample class are assigned
a p-value of 0; these are potentially readouts of
metabolic pathways that are uniquely activated in that biological
condition. For all other groups that are enriched for the isotopic
label in both conditions, getIsoDiffReport() uses an analysis analogous
to that described in step (4) of getIsoLabelReport() to determine
whether any isotopologues within the group are represented to a significantly
different degree in samples obtained from one condition versus the
other. The t-test is performed by using the relative
intensities of the isotopologues in the labeled samples of each condition.
The default output of getIsoDiffReport() is a table in which all labeled
isotopologue groups are displayed with their categorization and associated p-values for differential labeling (see Table 3). Additional subroutines are available to extract groups
of interest that meet user-defined p-value cutoffs
for significance and are not uniquely represented in one sample class
simply due to poor chromatographic resolution producing extra shoulder
peaks in those samples.

Results and Discussion
Untargeted
Retrieval of Isotopically Labeled Metabolites from
Astrocytes
Several approaches to the problem of detecting
isotopically labeled peaks in complex LC/MS data have been described
in the literature,22,23 but they conduct the isotopologue
search prescriptively, which prevents them from being robust untargeted
methods suitable for the discovery of new metabolites, uncharacteristic
metabolic pathways, or metabolic byproducts of xenobiotics. In contrast,
nontargeted tracer fate detection (NTFD) has been described for metabolomic
workflows based on gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).24 NTFD detects isotopically labeled features based
on differences in mass spectra collected from samples that have been
treated with a labeled tracer versus those that have not. In the present
work, we present a similarly unbiased approach to retrieving isotopically
labeled metabolites from LC/MS data, which differs from GC/MS data
in that metabolites are more frequently represented as intact molecular
ions than as ion fragments. Moreover, the NTFD method relies on the
extraction of pure compound spectra, which remains a challenge with
LC/MS data.25−27 To accommodate these complexities, X13CMS uses the feature-grouping and retention-time alignment capabilities
of XCMS to reduce the search space for isotopologue groups. The search
is then conducted exhaustively, using a small number of conservative
assumptions about the ion-intensity patterns expected for isotopologue
groups to filter out false calls based on mass difference and retention-time
alignment alone.

To validate this untargeted approach to isotope-label
detection, we examined the fates of U-13C-glucose in rat
astrocytes grown under standard culture conditions. Using getIsoLabelReport()
on LC/MS profiling data collected from parallel cultures of cells
treated with natural-abundance or U-13C-glucose for 30
min, we identified 193 isotopologue groups that were significantly
enriched for 13C at a p-value cutoff of
0.05. To confirm that these groups correspond to actual labeled metabolites,
we performed targeted MS/MS analyses on selected base isotopologues,
their most abundant labeled isotopologues, and unlabeled standards
matching the base isotopologues. A set of these analyses for the group
with a base m/z of 146.045 is shown
in Figure 2. Querying this m/z in METLIN returned glutamate as a possible identity,28 which was supported with the observation of
identical retention times of the standard and the group as well as
the strong match between the 10 V MS/MS fragmentation patterns of
the standard (Figure 2a) and the base isotopologue
(Figure 2b). Furthermore, the predicted fragmentation
pattern of the most abundant isotopologue, 148.050 m/z, was also observed (Figure 2c). This isotopologue corresponds to the presence of two 13C atoms in the molecule, both of which are retained in the fragment
that arises from a water loss (128.035 m/z). The corresponding fragment of the 148.050 isotopologue
is thus predicted to have an m/z of 130.042, and this was indeed observed. The other predominant
peak in the fragmentation pattern, 102.056 m/z, corresponds to a CO2 loss containing either
of the carboxylate carbons of glutamate. Depending on whether the
lost carbon is labeled or not, this peak is expected to shift to 103.059
or 104.063 m/z, both of which are
observed in the fragmentation pattern of the 148.050 m/z isotopologue. Taken together, these data indicate
that the 146.045 m/z group was correctly
identified by getIsoLabelReport() as a labeled metabolite.

To further validate the
untargeted label retrieval process, we
spiked cell extracts obtained from unlabeled, LPS-treated astrocytes
with known amounts of U-13C-lactate and alpha-15N-glutamine and analyzed them along with unspiked controls by LC/MS.
The data were processed with getIsoLabelReport() twice, once to search
for 13C and once for 15N. In the former case,
we recovered the isotopologue group with base m/z 89.024 and determined that in the spiked samples, approximately
half of the total lactate pool was present in the fully labeled form
(Figure 2d). The search for 15N
recovered the isotopologue group with base m/z 145.061, which was enriched for the +1 15N
peak (146.061 m/z) in the spiked
samples approximately 2.5 times more than in the unspiked samples
(Figure 2e). It should be noted that the resolution
of the Q-TOF used in these analyses is insufficient to differentiate
between the 0.99704 m/z difference
between 14N and 15N and the 1.00335 m/z difference between 12C and 13C. Consequently, the intensity of the 146.061 m/z peak in the spiked samples is a mix of signal
from both the natural abundance of singly 13C-labeled glutamine
as well as alpha-15N-glutamine. This circumstance did not
prevent getIsoLabelReport() from finding the +1 15N isotopologue,
due to its use of the control samples containing natural-abundance
distributions of isotopologues as a basis for comparison with the
labeled or spiked samples.

Differential Labeling Analysis of LPS-Challenged
Astrocytes
To illustrate the complete X13CMS workflow,
we investigated
the use of glucose in astrocytes challenged with the inflammatory
stimulus LPS. Astrocytes, the most abundant cell type in the central
nervous system, are metabolically linked to neurons through the delivery
of energy substrates, reuptake of neurotransmitters, and defense against
oxidative stress.29 In particular, inflammation-induced
astrocyte dysfunction has been associated with neurological pathologies
such as stroke, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s disease.30 The exact nature of the astrocyte response to
inflammatory stimuli remains incompletely understood, but it is known
that their glucose utilization is increased.29 Our aim in the current work was to use an untargeted isotopic labeling
approach to generate leads into the downstream metabolic consequences
of this increased glucose utilization.

In parallel, we cultured
immortalized rat astrocytes in media containing either U-13C-glucose or natural-abundance glucose. Subsets of both unlabeled
and labeled cultures were treated with LPS for the duration of the
labeling period (Figure 3a). Analysis of the
LC/MS profiling data of these samples with getIsoLabelReport() yielded
193 and 160 13C-enriched isotopologue groups in control
and LPS-challenged astrocytes, respectively. Of these, 130 were found
in samples from both conditions (Figure 3b).
Differential labeling analysis using getIsoDiffReport() and the additional
filtering subroutines described in the Experimental
Section revealed that 95 groups had statistically significant
different labeling patterns (p < 0.05) in control
versus LPS-challenged cells. These were divided into 56 groups uniquely
found in control cells and not in LPS-treated cells, 27 groups uniquely
found in LPS-treated cells and not in control cells, and 12 found
in both cell cultures (Figure 3c). The structural
characterization of each of these leads is beyond the scope of the
current work, but for illustrative purposes we show the extracted
ion chromatograms for the group with a base isotopologue of 133.013 m/z, which is one of the 12 shared but
differentially labeled groups (Figure 3d).
The enrichment of the highest mass isotopologue of the group, 136.023 m/z, occurs to a greater extent in the
LPS-treated astrocytes than in the controls (Figure 3e). Although MS/MS analysis suggested that this isotopologue
group corresponds to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate
malate, we note also that the majority of the differentially labeled
isotopologue groups (62 out of 95) contain a base peak of over 250 m/z. These groups are unlikely to correspond
to the intermediates of central carbon metabolism (glycolysis and
the TCA cycle), and their predominance suggests that the increased
glucose utilization of LPS-challenged astrocytes is not being directed
exclusively toward energy-producing pathways. As is typical for untargeted
metabolomic workflows, these outputs of X13CMS are not
definitive phenotypic readouts but rather leads that require further
investigation to determine their chemical identities and validate
their biological significance.

Integrating Untargeted
Isotopic Labeling Analysis with Label-Free
Metabolomics
To interrogate the degree of complementarity
between the isotopic labeling platform described here to the standard
untargeted metabolomic approach applied to nonlabeled samples, we
compared a set of results from each type of analysis performed on
the astrocyte profiling data. Comparing unlabeled control to unlabeled
LPS-challenged cultures with the XCMS routine diffreport(), we identified
32 differentially regulated features (defined by p-value < 0.05 for difference in absolute intensity values between
sample classes; fold change > 1.5 between sample classes; and mean
absolute intensity > 10000 in at least one sample class). Comparing
these 32 features with the 95 identified as being differentially labeled
by X13CMS, we discovered that only two were recovered by
both analyses (Figure 4). Taken together, these
results suggest that two broad classes of metabolic shifts occur in
LPS-challenged astrocytes. In the first type, identified by the traditional
label-free approach, the LPS challenge alters the regulation of pathways
that do not use carbon from glucose, which leads to different-sized
pools of unlabeled metabolites. In the second type of shift, identified
by tracing the fates of labeled glucose, treatment with LPS alters
the regulation of a number of pathways that are ultimately linked
to glucose, but the total pools of the metabolites involved in these
pathways do not change presumably because of compensatory flux through
other pathways that do not involve glucose.

Figure 4 Comparison of outputs
from untargeted isotope labeling analysis
and label-free untargeted metabolomics.

The lack of a large overlap in the outputs of the standard
label-free
workflow and our untargeted isotopic labeling analysis highlights
the complementarity of the two approaches. The former platform generates
leads by discovering metabolites whose levels change significantly
as a function of biological perturbation.31,32 While a powerful approach, the consideration of only altered metabolite
levels overlooks the potentially important roles played by metabolites
whose levels do not change. A cell or organism may activate numerous
compensatory pathways to maintain steady, homeostatic levels of critical
metabolites when challenged with disruptive conditions. For example,
acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) is a central metabolite found at the convergence
of several catabolic and anabolic pathways.33 Disruption of any one of these pathways (e.g., glycolysis) may be
insufficient to alter acetyl-CoA levels due to compensatory changes
in the other pathways that connect to this metabolite (e.g., upregulation
of fatty acid oxidation34). In theory,
a comprehensive measurement of all metabolite levels would reveal
changes in the levels of metabolites that act in compensatory pathways,
thereby implicating them as part of the biochemical response to the
perturbation. However, the current state of global-profiling technology
remains inadequate to realize this type of analysis. Not all metabolites
can be detected by LC/MS, and of those that can, only a small subset
is typically assigned definitive chemical identities. Furthermore,
the dynamics of cellular metabolism can be highly nonlinear,35 which precludes drawing mechanistic conclusions
from simple correlative models between metabolite levels. To overcome
these limitations, isotopic labeling analysis can be applied to track
the altered metabolic fluxes that arise from activation of compensatory
pathways. In the example of acetyl-CoA, use of a labeled upstream
substrate may reveal movement of the label to acetyl-CoA in one condition
but not another, despite total acetyl-CoA levels remaining the same
in both conditions.

Conclusions
Standard untargeted
metabolomic approaches typically report the
static levels of a broad range of metabolites from unlabeled samples.
In contrast, isotopic labeling analysis provides information about
pathway fluxes but most commonly only for a limited number of metabolites
that are measured with targeted methodologies. Here, we present an
approach that conceptually integrates characteristics from each of
these experimental designs to provide insights into isotopic labeling
at the systems level. Our approach leverages recent advances in untargeted
metabolomics to track the metabolism of isotopically labeled substrates
in an unbiased manner and to determine if this metabolism changes
as a function of biological perturbation. These analyses are facilitated
by the software program presented here, X13CMS. We have
shown that X13CMS can identify features that are enriched
for the precursor-derived isotopic label, as well as analyze differences
in their labeling patterns between samples arising from different
biological contexts. This latter application of X13CMS
can reveal metabolic insights that are not gained by standard untargeted
metabolomic approaches that only use unlabeled samples. Thus, X13CMS provides valuable insights into metabolic mechanisms
that are highly complementary to those available through existing
metabolomic technologies.
