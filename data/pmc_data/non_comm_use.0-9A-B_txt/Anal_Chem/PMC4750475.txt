Nanomaterials which can respond to
external stimuli have attracted
considerable attention due to their potential applications in sensing
and biomedicine. One of the most promising classes of such materials
is the stimuli-responsive liposome that can release its contents in
response to a specific target. Despite recent progress, development
of liposomes responsive to small molecular targets remains a challenge,
due to the difficulty in designing the transduction process to link
between target binding and triggered release, even though small molecular
metabolites play important roles in many biological processes. Herein,
we demonstrate a combination of an aptamer (apt) for target recognition
and enzyme phosphatidylcholine 2-acetylhydrolase (PLA2)
for rupture of liposome. As a proof-of-concept, cocaine molecules
were used to trigger the release of the enzyme. The exposure to DNA–PLA2 conjugates induced the rupture of liposome containing uranin
and gadopentetic acid (Gd-DTPA), allowing multimodal fluorescent and
MRI detection of cocaine. The strategy demonstrated in this work can
be generally applied to other imaging modalities by loading different
imaging agents, as well as other targets by using different functional
DNAs.

==== Body
An active
research topic in
the field of bionanotechnology is the development of multimodal detection
agents. Toward this goal, there has been significant interest in nanomaterials
with the ability to load multiple payloads in an inert and protected
state during transportation or circulation,1 in which different detection agents are combined in one vehicle
to allow simultaneous detection in a variety of complementary modes.2 These systems have further been refined into
stimuli-responsive nanomaterials, which allow a greater degree of
control over the timing, position, and selectivity of the payloads
release profile.3

The general principle
behind the stimuli-responsive nanomaterials
lies in the fact that a specific physical, chemical, and biological
stimulus can trigger the conformational or compositional changes of
the nanomaterials, inducing payload release.4 Because of these desirable features, a variety of stimuli-responsive
nanomaterials have been reported, including gold nanomaterials,5 quantum dots,6 dendrimers,7 and nanoemulsions.8 Each of these platforms possesses unique fabrication components
and can promote the release of loaded imaging agents due to external
stimuli.

Among the varieties of stimuli-responsive nanomaterials,
liposomes
have shown significant promise due to their superior biocompatibility,
high loading efficiency, and versatility in terms of size and surface
modification.9 As a result, liposome products
have been approved by FDA for clinical use for two decades.10 Recent research has focused on transforming
passive liposomes into stimuli-responsive liposomes triggered by a
wide range of physical stimuli, including magnetic or electric fields,11 temperature,12 light,13 and acoustic waves.14 Liposomes responsive to biochemical stimuli, such as pH, redox,
enzymes, and host–guest recognitions,15−17 have also been
explored but to a much less extent. Despite these progress, one important
class of biological molecules is particularly underrepresented as
trigger elements: the small molecular metabolites. A generalized stimuli-responsive
liposome system that allows responsiveness to specific small molecular
targets remains a significant challenge. The barrier lies in the design
of the signal transduction process between the small molecular target
recognition and liposome triggered release.

To meet the challenge,
the use of DNA aptamers, which can be selected
from a large DNA library to bind targets with high selectivity and
specificity,18 has emerged as a promising
solution to bridge the gap in a signal transduction process for a
wide range of small molecular targets.19 Taking advantage of this ability, aptamers have been combined with
different signaling agents to develop many types of sensors for small
molecules,19 including fluorescence,20 colorimetry,21 electrochemistry,22 and magnetic resonance.23 Building upon these successes, we report herein a stimuli-responsive
liposome system, which allows multimodal detection of small molecule
targets, such as cocaine, in a sensitive and selective manner by using
an aptamer–enzyme triggered response pathway. The presence
of cocaine molecules triggers the release of DNA–enzyme conjugates,
which break the lipid bilayer of liposomes, causing release of the
payloads. Fluorescence and MRI detection of cocaine were demonstrated
using liposomes loaded with corresponding signaling agents, indicating
a broad scope of this approach for different detection modalities.

Results
and Discussion
In order to develop a stimuli-responsive liposome
that is responsive
to small molecular targets, we need to build a link between recognition
of the target molecules and rupture of the liposome to release the
payloads. We chose a class of heat-stable, calcium-dependent enzymes
phosphatidylcholine 2-acetylhydrolase (PLA2) to provide
such a link. In aqueous solution, PLA2 catalyzes the hydrolysis
of the 2-acyl bond of 3-n-phosphoglycerides, a major
component of biological membranes, generating lysolipid and fatty
acid as the major products.24 Therefore,
a direct relationship can be established between the concentrations
of PLA2 and the amount of ruptured liposomes. More importantly,
because of the efficient enzymatic turnover, PLA2 with
nanomolar concentration can lead to the rupture of liposomes of much
higher under ambient conditions, making it an ideal catalyst to release
the signaling agents and amplify the “turn-on” signals.

The next challenge is to establish the relationship between target
and PLA2 concentrations. Inspired by the design of aptamer
sensors, we propose a target-triggered enzyme releasing process using
a DNA–PLA2 conjugate to establish the relationship
(Figure 1). The PLA2 enzyme can be immobilized onto magnetic beads (MBs) through
DNA hybridization between an aptamer attached to MBs and its complementary
DNA conjugated to the PLA2, forming MB-supported conjugates.
The binding of the target molecules by the aptamer weakens the hybridization
between the aptamer and DNA–PLA2 conjugate, resulting
in release of the conjugate. The PLA2 enzyme that remains
on the MB will be removed from the solution through magnetic separation.
The released conjugates can catalyze the hydrolysis of liposomes with
signaling molecules inside, resulting in the release of signaling
agents into the solution. Under optimized conditions, the concentration
of released signaling agents is proportional to the concentration
of released enzymes and therefore is proportional to the target molecules.
The combination of aptamer, PLA2, and liposomes allows
the transduction between targets and signal output. Since different
signaling agents can be encapsulated in the liposome and different
aptamers can be obtained through systematic evolution of ligands by
exponential enrichment (SELEX),25,26 this strategy provides
a general platform for detecting small molecule targets with multiple
signal outputs.

Figure 1 Scheme of stimuli-responsive liposomes responsive to small
molecular
targets for the multimodal detection.

The conjugation of thiolated linker DNA to PLA2 was
carried out by using a heterobifuntional linker sulfosuccinimidyl
4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (sulfo-SMCC),
which can link the surface amines on the PLA2 with DNA
(Figure 2a). To demonstrate
the successful conjugation chemistry of the DNA–PLA2 conjugate, SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis was applied, followed by
fluorescence and photographic imaging. For this experiment, Coomassie
Brilliant Blue was used to stain the free PLA2 and the
concentrated but not fully purified DNA–PLA2 conjugate.
The thiolated DNA was modified with fluorescein so that the free DNA
and DNA–PLA2 conjugate could be fluorescently imaged.
As shown in Figure 2b, the DNA–PLA2 conjugate exhibited multiple bands
that migrated slowly in both the photograph image (left) and fluorescent
image (right), while the free DNA and free PLA2 migrated
faster than the DNA–PLA2 conjugate. The molecular
weight of the free PLA2 is ∼18 kDa, which is in
agreement with the location of the band. After conjugating with ∼7
kDa DNA strands, the molecular weight of the conjugates showed multiple
bands around ∼25–50 kDa, suggesting one or multiple
DNA strands binding to PLA2. The UV absorption spectrum
of purified DNA–PLA2 conjugate is the sum of those
of free DNA and PLA2, further confirming the successful
formation of the DNA–PLA2 conjugates (Figure 2c). Further enzyme activity
studies confirmed that the formed DNA–PLA2 conjugates
retained ∼50% enzymatic activity of free PLA2 (Figure S1a,b).

The formulation and hydrolysis
of the stimuli-responsive liposome
is shown in Figure 3a. The PEG modification on the surface increases the surface area
interacting with PLA2 and therefore increases the rate
of the hydrolysis reaction.27 Uranin and
gadopentetic acid (Gd-DTPA) were
encapsulated into liposomes as signaling agents. To elucidate the
size and morphology of stimuli-responsive liposome, cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) experiments were performed. The obtained liposomes
were spherical, with an average size of around ∼160 nm (Figure 3b). The liposomes
were further characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Figure S2). The liposomes showed an average hydrodynamic
diameter of ∼150 nm, which is consistent with the Cryo-EM images.
When the PLA2 was added into liposome solution, the average
hydrodynamic diameter increased to >200 nm after 30 min incubation,
indicating the hydrolysis of liposomes. The monodispersity of the
liposomes is comparable to those reported in the literature.28,29 Better monodispersity would increase the precision of the sensing
results.

The release profile of stimuli-responsive liposome
was first tested
to optimize the experimental conditions in pH 7.4 HEPES buffer. The
liposomes containing uranin were treated with PLA2 of various
concentrations at room temperature for 15 min and 1 h, respectively
(Figure S3a,b). The liposome treated with
Triton-X and heat, which is known to rupture the liposome completely,
was used as a positive control (red dot). The liposome incubated without
PLA2 was used as negative control (green dot). The fluorescence
profile and photograph image were monitored. The results suggested
that higher concentrations of PLA2 resulted in increasing
green color and higher fluorescence intensity. After incubation, the
liposome sample treated with 16 nM PLA2 started reaching
a plateau, and in the presence of 64 nM PLA2, the liposome
sample showed ∼80% fluorescence intensity of the positive control
(Figure S3b). The kinetics of uranin-loaded
stimuli-responsive liposome releasing profile was further studied
in the presence of 16 nM PLA2 (Figure 3c). The results showed that stimuli-responsive
liposome began to rupture after 15 min and started reaching a plateau
after 40 min. These studies suggested that even low-nanomolar changes
in PLA2 concentration can potentially release enough uranin
to generate detectable fluorescence signal.

liposome and the hydrolysis

micrograph of stimuli-responsive liposomes. (c) Kinetic curve of the
release of uranin molecules inside liposomes at different incubation
times under 16 nM PLA2 concentrations.

To demonstrate the proof-of-concept of the liposome responsive
to small molecule targets, cocaine was selected as the model target,
as cocaine is an important diagnostic target and cocaine aptamer is
a well-studied DNA aptamer. As shown in Figure 4a, the DNA–PLA2 conjugates
hybridize with the cocaine aptamer and biotin–DNA. The DNA
strands were further immobilized onto MBs by streptavidin–biotin
binding. The target-specific structure switching of the aptamer in
the presence of cocaine can release the DNA–PLA2 conjugate to solution and hydrolyze the liposomes containing uranin
fluorophores and Gd-DTPA MRI contrast agents, resulting in an increase
of the outputs for both signals. The fluorescence detection of cocaine
with the concentration from 5 to 1000 μM is shown in Figures 4b and S4. Upon the addition of as low as 10 μM
cocaine and subsequent removal of the MBs, the spectrum showed >10%
increased fluorescence intensity compared to that of a sample containing
no cocaine (Figure S4). The calibration
curve was plotted using relative fluorescence intensity. In the presence
of cocaine with a concentration ranging from 5 to 1000 μM, the
increase of cocaine concentration resulted in the increase of the
relative fluorescence intensity, which started reaching a plateau
when the cocaine concentration was higher 200 μM (Figure 4b). Moreover, the result in Figure 2b suggests one or
multiple DNA strands binding to PLA2. As a result, it may
take more than one equivalent cocaine molecule to release the DNA–PLA2 conjugate, which may affect the sensitivity of the system.
The sensitivity can be improved further by developing conjugation
approaches that can achieve high yield of 1:1 DNA to PLA2 conjugates.

(e) T1-weighted images of Gd-DTPA liposome samples treated with cocaine
of different concentrations.

To demonstrate the generality of the stimuli-responsive liposome
platform for other detection modalities besides fluorescence, Gd-DTPA,
a widely used T1-weighted MRI contrast agent, was loaded into stimuli-responsive
liposomes for MRI detection of cocaine. Different concentrations of
cocaine samples (0–1000 μM) were added to trigger the
target specific structure switching of the aptamer to release the
DNA–PLA2 conjugate into solution. The released PLA2 was mixed with Gd-liposomes and incubated at room temperature
for 1 h. The PLA2-treated Gd-liposomes were centrifuged,
and the supernatant was collected for MRI data by using an Allegra
3T MRI scanner (Figure S5).

The T1-weighted
MRI images obtained at different inversion times
were used to estimate T1 relaxation time for samples of different
cocaine concentrations. Quantitative analysis was achieved by plotting
T1 relaxation time with corresponding cocaine concentration. The addition
of cocaine decreased the T1 relaxation time from ∼2430 ms in
the presence of 50 μM cocaine to ∼1970 ms in the presence
of 1000 μM cocaine (Figure S6a).
The percentage of T1 change profile indicated that there was a ∼20%
average T1 change after the treatment of 1000 μM cocaine (Figure 4c). The selectivity
of cocaine detection using this stimuli-responsive liposome platform
was tested by measuring the T1 response toward 1000 μM cocaine,
adenosine, and glucose (Figures 4d and S6b). The addition
of cocaine decreased the average T1 by ∼21% (from ∼2490
to ∼1970 ms), while the addition of the same concentration
of adenosine and glucose only changed T1 by ∼2.8% (to ∼2420
ms) and ∼4.4%,(to ∼2380 ms), respectively. Although
this cocaine aptamer has shown good selectivity over adenosine and
glucose, it has been reported that this cocaine aptamer may bind quinine
derivatives.30,31 This poor selectivity can be
improved by performing SELEX employing “negative selection”
to remove sequences that bind quinine derivatives. Despite this issue,
the sensing system design can be applied to detect other targets selectively,
as long as the corresponding aptamer displays the required selectivity.
Furthermore, at an inversion time of 800 ms and repetition time of
2000 ms, the T1-weighted MRI of different samples under increased
cocaine concentration from left to right changed from dark (left:
no cocaine) to brighter (in the presence of 1000 μM of cocaine),
showing the contrast of the T1-weighted images increased with the
addition of different concentrations of cocaine (Figure 4e). The observation is consistent
with the trends of the T1 change, suggesting that a ∼20% T1
change can provide a significant contrast change for potential diagnostic
applications.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
developed a stimuli-responsive liposome
platform that is responsive to external small molecular stimuli by
using aptamer and PLA2 enzyme. The use of DNA–PLA2 conjugate provided a link between the target recognition
ability from aptamer and the signal production ability from liposome.
As a proof-of-concept, fluorescence and MRI detection were demonstrated
by loading uranin and Gd-DTPA into liposomes as signaling agents.
The liposome platform can achieve low-micromolar sensitivity for fluorescence
detection and a ∼50 μM detection limit for MRI detection,
which is comparable to previously reported methods,21,32,33 indicating the compatibility of this platform
for different detection modalities. Aptamers that have much stronger
affinity for other targets can be employed,34−36 which will
allow this system with much higher sensitivity. Furthermore, because
the aptamer–PLA2 trigger-release mechanism is compatible
with different functional DNAs, the target-responsive liposome system
can be easily applied to other aptamers and DNAzymes. The broad scope
of this reported strategy to various small molecular targets as well
as imaging agents would allow a wide range of potential diagnostic
and therapeutic applications.
