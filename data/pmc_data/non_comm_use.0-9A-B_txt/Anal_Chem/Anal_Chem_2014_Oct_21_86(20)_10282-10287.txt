Arsenic-containing lipids (arsenolipids)
are novel natural products
recently shown to be widespread in marine animals and algae. Research
interest in these arsenic compounds lies in their possible role in
the membrane chemistry of organisms and, because they occur in many
popular seafoods, their human metabolism and toxicology. Progress
has been restricted, however, by the lack of standard arsenolipids
and of a quantitative method for their analysis. We report that the
certified reference material CRM 7405-a (Hijiki) is a rich source
of arsenolipids, and we describe a method based on HPLC-ICPMS/ESMS
to quantitatively measure seven of the major arsenolipids present.
Sample preparation involved extraction with DCM/methanol, a cleanup
step with silica, and conversion of the (oxo)arsenolipids originally
present to thio analogues by brief treatment with H2S.
Compared to their oxo analogues, the thioarsenolipids showed much
sharper peaks on reversed-phase HPLC, which facilitated their resolution
and quantification. The compounds were determined by HPLC-ICPMS and
HPLC-ESMS, which provided both arsenic-selective detection and high
resolution molecular mass detection of the arsenolipids. In this way,
the concentrations of two arsenic-containing hydrocarbons and five
arsenosugar phospholipids are reported in the CRM Hijiki. This material
may serve as a convenient source of characterized arsenolipids to
delineate the presence of these compounds in seafoods and to facilitate
research in a new era of arsenic biochemistry.

==== Body
The presence of lipid-soluble
arsenic (arsenolipids) in marine organisms has been known since the
1920s when Sadolin first reported arsenic concentrations of 3.0–4.5
μg g–1 in cod liver oil.1 Further work indicated the presence of at least two types
of unidentified arsenolipids in the oil from herring and cod liver,2 and lipid-soluble arsenicals were also reported
from marine and freshwater algae3 and in
marine invertebrates.4 The first structure
for an arsenolipid was provided in 1988 by the classic study of Morita
and Shibata who identified, mainly by 1H NMR, an arsenosugar
phospholipid in a marine alga (Wakame).5

Recent work has greatly extended the range of arsenolipids
found
in marine samples: arsenic-containing fatty acids (AsFA), first reported
in cod liver oil,6 have now been found
in a wide range of fish species7−10 in addition to algae;11 arsenic-containing hydrocarbons (AsHC), following the first report
of their presence in capelin,12 have also
been found in various fish13,14 and in two species
of algae;15 and arsenosugar phospholipids
(AsPL) have been found in algae.11,15 In total,
about 55 arsenolipids have been identified so far, with over 40 of
them being reported in the last two years. Most of these arsenolipids
have been identified by analytical methods based on separations by
HPLC and the complementary use of inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometry (ICPMS) and electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS) for
the detection of arsenic and molecular species, respectively. Figure 1 shows the structures of seven arsenolipids referred
to in the work to be reported here.

Arsenolipids initially attracted
research interest because of their
novel structures, their possible involvement in membrane biochemistry
and, because they are present in common seafoods, issues of human
health and arsenic toxicity.16 Possible
human health issues have recently been highlighted by the discovery
that arsenic-containing hydrocarbons show toxicity comparable to that
of the highly toxic arsenite in cytotoxicity tests with cultured human
bladder and liver cells.17

Further
progress in the biological chemistry and toxicology of
arsenolipids has been hindered by the lack of standards and quantitative
analytical methods. Although some of the AsHCs and AsFAs have recently
been synthesized,18 there are no standards
or reference compounds available for AsPLs. With the view of assisting
research in the area of arsenolipids in biological chemistry, we report
the characterization and quantification of seven of the major arsenolipids
in the certified reference material NMIJ 7405-a (Hijiki). This CRM
has already been certified for total arsenic and inorganic AsV.19

in algae and referred to in the current
study.

Experimental Section
Chemicals and Standards
Water was obtained from a Milli-Q
system (18.2 MΩ cm, Millipore GmbH, Vienna, Austria). Methanol
(≥99.9%, MeOH), dichloromethane (≥99.9%, DCM), chloroform
(≥99.9%), methyl-tertiary-butyl ether (≥99.5%, MTBE),
acetonitrile (≥99.9%, AcN), toluene (≥99.8%), formic
acid (≥98%), and ammonia (25%) were obtained from Carl Roth
GmbH (Karlsruhe, Germany); hexane (≥95%), ethyl acetate (≥99.5%,
EtOAc), diethyl ether (≥99.5%, Et2O), and acetone
(≥99.5%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Vienna, Austria);
and ethanol (≥99.9%, EtOH) and silica gel 60 were obtained
from Merck (Buchs, Switzerland). Arsenic(V) standard solution (998
± 5 mg As L–1) was also obtained from Merck.
The certified reference material (CRM) was NMIJ CRM 7405-a (Trace
Elements and Arsenic Compounds in Seaweed—Hijiki) from the
Natural Metrology Institute of Japan (Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan). Saturated
hydrogen sulfide (H2S) solution was prepared by bubbling
H2S gas (produced by a Kipp’s apparatus) through
EtOH for 10 min. Standard compounds of AsHC332, AsHC360 and AsHC388
were synthesized in-house according to Taleshi et al.18 and prepared by dissolving 7.5 ± 0.2 μg (as
As) in methanol (1 mL).

Instrumentation
Solvents were evaporated
on a centrifugal
lyophilizer (Maxi Dry Plus, Heto Holten, Allerød, Denmark). Acid
digestion of samples was performed with an Ultraclave microwave system
(MLS GmbH, Leutkirch, Germany). HPLC separations were performed on
an Agilent 1100 series system prior to online ICPMS measurements with
an Agilent 7500ce series instrument (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn,
Germany). The ICPMS was equipped with an Ari Mist HP nebulizer (Burgerner,
Mississauga, Canada) and an ESI PC3 Peltier cooled cyclonic spray
chamber (Elemental Scientific, Omaha, USA). High Resolution-ESMS measurements
were carried out on a Q-Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap MS after
HPLC performed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 series instrument (Thermo
Fischer Scientific, Erlangen, Germany). The ESMS was equipped with
an atmospheric pressure ionization source employing electrospray nebulization
with nitrogen as nebulizer gas. Measurements were performed in positive
mode, with a drying gas temperature of 350 °C, a spray voltage
of 3.2 kV and a resolution of 70 000. The mass range was set
to m/z 300–1100 without additional
fragmentation.

Total Arsenic Determination—Acid Digestion
and ICPMS
The CRM 7405-a (15 mg), a portion of all sample
extracts (100 μL),
and the AsHC standards (50 μL of the prepared 7.5 ± 0.2
mg As L–1 standards) were analyzed for total arsenic
content in triplicate. The samples were weighed into quartz tubes
(12 mL) and solvents, if present, were evaporated (10 mbar, room temperature;
Maxi Dry Plus). Water (2 mL) and HNO3 (2 mL) were added
to the samples before the tubes were covered with Teflon caps, transferred
to a Teflon rack in the microwave system which then was closed. Argon
(40 bar) was applied and the following temperature program was started:
0–10 min, 80 °C; 10–30 min, 150 °C; 30–45
min, 250 °C; 45–65 min, 250 °C. The digest solutions
were then allowed to cool to room temperature, transferred to polypropylene
tubes (15 mL) and diluted with water to 9.9 mL. Finally, 100 μL
of a solution containing 1 mg L–1 Ge, In, and Te
was added to all digested samples as internal standards, giving a
final concentration of 10 μg L–1 Ge, In, and
Te.

Determination of arsenic in the digested samples was carried
out by ICPMS in collision cell mode (He, 5 mL min–1) to avoid polyatomic interferences from argon chloride (40Ar35Cl) on arsenic (75As). Standards for calibration
were prepared in 20% HNO3 for matrix matching and contained
10 μg L–1 Ge, In and Te as internal standards.
The total arsenic determination was validated against the certified
reference material CRM 7405-a (Hijiki) with a certified value for
arsenic of 35.8 ± 0.9 μg As g–1; we obtained
35.6 ± 0.9 μg As g–1 (n = 3).

Optimization of the Extraction Procedure
The following
parameters were varied to optimize the extraction process for arsenolipids
from the CRM 7405-a; all experiments were performed in triplicate
using 100 mg of CRM Hijiki. (i) Extraction solutions: The extractants
tested were hexane (5 mL) or a solvent/MeOH mixture (always 2 + 1
v/v, 5 mL) where the solvents were DCM, chloroform, toluene, acetone,
Et2O, MTBE, EtOAc, or AcN. (ii) For DCM/MeOH (2 + 1) volume
of extraction solution tested was 3, 5, and 7 mL. (iii) Sequential
extraction was tested for the DCM/MeOH mixture (4 × 5 mL). (iv)
Recoveries were tested by spiking CRM at levels comparable to the
natural level of two arsenolipids with standards of AsHC332 (750 ng
As g–1) and AsHC360 (60 ng As g–1) prior to extraction. (v) The efficiency of the cleanup step (silica
column) was tested by comparing presilica (crude) and postsilica fractions;
for the presilica fraction, the crude extract (1 mL) was taken directly
after the centrifugation step, evaporated to dryness and redissolved
in EtOH (500 μL).

Extraction Procedure for Arsenic Speciation
Analysis
Triplicates of CRM 7405-a (∼100 mg, weighed
to a precision
of 0.1 mg) were extracted with 5 mL DCM/MeOH (2 + 1, v/v) on a rotatory
cross for 1 h at room temperature. The mixture was centrifuged (10
min, 2100 G) to separate the pellet from the liquid phase. A portion
of the supernatant (4 mL) was transferred to a silica column (glass
Pasteur pipet, 150 × 5 mm, filled to a height of 4 cm with silica
gel 60), conditioned with MeOH/acetone (1 + 1, v/v) containing 1%
formic acid (5 mL); the column was washed with the “conditioning”
mixture (4 mL), then MeOH (2 mL), and finally MeOH containing 1% NH3 (8 mL). H2S (in EtOH, 100 μL) was added
to the alkaline fraction and mixed prior to complete evaporation of
the solvent (10 mbar, room temperature). The obtained pellet was redissolved
in EtOH (500 μL) with ultrasonication and vortexing at room
temperature. All steps in the procedure were performed with glassware.

Chemical Conversion Procedure—Formation and Stability
of Thio Arsenolipids
A solution containing standards of AsHC332,
AsHC360, and AsHC388 (300 μg As L–1 each)
was prepared in EtOH to a final volume of 1 mL and measured with RP-HPLC-HR-ESMS
(t = 0). Then, a saturated H2S solution (100 μL)
was added, the mixture was shaken and immediately measured again (t
= ca. 0.5 min); repeated measurements (RP-HPLC-HR-ESMS) were made
at the following times: t = 11, 22, 32, and 122 min
and 1 and 7 days.

Identification and Quantification of Arsenic
Species (RP-HPLC-ICPMS/HR-ESMS)
Separation was carried out
by reversed-phase HPLC using a ZORBAX
Eclipse XDB-C8 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm particle size).
Elution was performed with an aqueous solution containing 0.1% formic
acid and EtOH containing 0.1% formic acid with the following gradient:
0–3 min, 70% EtOH; 3–10 min, 90% EtOH; and 10–20
min, 90% EtOH. The flow rate was 1.0 mL min–1 and
the injection volume was 20 μL for ICPMS and 5 μL for
HR-ESMS measurements. The HPLC effluent was split, whereby 20% was
transferred to the detection unit and 80% to waste (to avoid destabilization
of the plasma caused by overloading with organic solvent) using a
passive splitter (Analytical Scientific Instruments, Richmond, USA).
For ICPMS measurements, a support flow of water containing 1% formic
acid and 10 μg L–1 Ge and Te (1.0 mL min–1) was introduced through a T-piece after the splitter.
Carbon compensation20 was performed by
continuous addition of water/EtOH (4 + 1, v/v) delivered with an ISIS
pump (0.02 rpm) to ensure a constant carbon content reaching the plasma.
ESMS data were obtained in positive scan mode at m/z 300–1100. Data evaluation was done with
chromatographic software Xcalibur Version 3.0.63 (Thermo Scientific,
San Jose, USA). ICPMS signals were recorded at m/z 75 (75As and 40Ar35Cl)
and m/z 77 (40Ar37Cl, for possible chloride interferences) at dwell times of
300 ms, and for internal standards at m/z 74 (74Ge) and m/z 125
(125Te) at dwell times of 100 ms. A summary of the used
techniques and parameters is given in Table 1. Data evaluation was carried out with chromatographic software MassHunter
Version B.01.01 (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). Quantification
was based on peak areas against external calibration with standard
AsHC332, AsHC360 and AsHC388.

Results and Discussion
We aimed
to develop a method based on HPLC-ICPMS/ESMS for the quantitative
determination of arsenolipids applicable to the certified reference
material CRM 7405-a (Hijiki), which could then be used as a characterized
source of arsenolipids. The method development involved the following
steps: (i) choice of solvent and extraction conditions, (ii) cleanup
step using silica, (iii) conversion of the (oxo) arsenolipids to their
thio derivatives, and (iv) identification and quantification of the
major arsenolipids in CRM Hijiki.

Extraction of Arsenolipids
Methods
for extracting lipids
from biological samples have traditionally used methanol/chloroform
mixtures,21 whereas more recent work has
demonstrated the practical advantages of using methanol/MTBE.22 We tested the extraction efficiency of hexane
(polarity index =0) and eight solvents as mixtures with methanol (2
+ 1, v/v) by measuring the total arsenic extracted (Table 2) and, individually, the seven main arsenolipids
in the extracts (Figure 2 and Supporting Information, Table S-1). Hexane extracted less
than 3% (0.97 μg g–1) of the total arsenic
in the original CRM (35.6 μg g–1). Much higher
extraction efficiencies (∼18%) were obtained with mixtures
of methanol with toluene (6.58 μg g–1), DCM
(6.24 μg g–1), or chloroform (6.21 μg
g–1); the other five solvent mixtures returned lower
extraction efficiencies of ∼10–13%.

There were
also differences, depending on solvent mixture, in the extraction
efficiencies for the two major groups of arsenolipids in CRM Hijiki,
namely arsenosugar phospholipids (AsPLs) and arsenic-containing hydrocarbons
(AsHCs). All eight solvent mixtures showed comparable ability to extract
the AsHCs giving values of 80–95% of that obtained for the
most efficient solvent mixture (DCM/methanol for AsHC332 and toluene/methanol
for AsHC360). The AsPLs, however, showed a clear preference for the
DCM/methanol mixture which was the most efficient solvent in all cases:
the other seven solvent mixtures showed efficiencies of 35–80%
relative to DCM/methanol (Figure 2). Thus,
further method development was performed with the DCM/methanol mixture.

a Except for hexane, which was
used alone, extraction solution was a mixture of solvent/MeOH (2 +
1, v/v). In all cases, 5 mL of solvent was used with 100 mg of CRM
Hijiki (n = 3).

Figure 2 Mean relative
extraction efficiencies (n = 3)
for seven arsenolipids depending on solvent mixture (100 mg CRM extracted
with 5 mL solvent/MeOH (2 + 1, v/v). For each arsenolipid, values
are recorded as the amount of arsenolipid extracted by a particular
solvent relative to the amount extracted by the most efficient solvent
(expressed as %); detailed data are presented in Supporting Information, Table S-1).

Up to this point, extractions had been performed with 100
mg of
(dry) CRM Hijiki and a single extraction with 5 mL of solvent mixture.
The extraction efficiency was tested for the DCM/methanol mixture
also for volumes of 3 and 7 mL (100 mg CRM Hijiki) and found to have
no significant effect on extraction efficiency; the 5 mL volume was
the most convenient for handling. Sequential extraction, whereby 100
mg CRM Hijiki was treated with 4 × 5 mL of the DCM/methanol mixture,
showed that ca. 90% was removed in the first extraction (Supporting Information, Tables S-2 and S-3).
On the basis of these results, a single extraction with 5 mL of the
DCM/methanol mixture was used in the subsequent steps of method development.

Cleanup Step using Silica
Preliminary attempts to analyze
the crude extract from CRM Hijiki showed that although HPLC-ICPMS
data were reasonable, the data from HPLC-ESMS were strongly matrix-affected.
Thus, a previously described cleanup step15 was incorporated whereby a portion (4 mL) of the extract was applied
to a small silica column and the column was washed with MeOH/acetone
(1 + 1, v/v, containing 1% formic acid) and then MeOH to remove matrix
components. By virtue of the interaction between the basic O=AsR3 group of the arsenolipids and silica, the arsenolipids are
retained on the small column whereas normal lipids are not. To remove
the arsenolipids, the column was then washed with MeOH containing
1% NH3. In this way, the arsenolipids were recovered quantitatively,
while ∼98% (by mass) of the original matrix was removed.

Conversion of the (Oxo) Arsenolipids to their Thio Derivatives
Similar to many naturally occurring water-soluble arsenicals, arsenolipids
contain arsenic in the oxo form, that is, O=AsR3. Our early attempts to effect separation of the arsenolipids in
CRM Hijiki were hampered by broad poorly resolved peaks, which we
presumed was due to the polar oxo arsenic group interacting with the
silica backbone of the HPLC-column. However, the thio analogues of
naturally occurring oxo arsenicals (i.e., containing S=AsR3), which are readily formed from the oxo compounds, are much
less polar. Our previous experience24,25 with the separation
of water-soluble arsenic compounds demonstrated that the thio analogues
are better resolved than the oxo compounds. We found similar effects
for arsenolipids–for the three standard compounds tested, the
thio analogues were better resolved and gave sharper peaks compared
with the oxo analogues (Figure 3). Resolution
was further improved by running the HPLC gradients with mixtures containing
ethanol rather than methanol. The higher elution power of ethanol
offered a wider scope of gradient conditions compared to methanol
which required 100% solvent for long periods to elute all compounds.

We then investigated the rate of the oxo/thio conversion, and the
stability of the thio products, by measuring with HPLC-ESMS both the
appearance of the thio analogue and the disappearance of the oxo analogue
following the addition of H2S. At the first time measurement
point (t = 0.5 min) the reaction was already ∼60%
complete, and at t = 11 min, it was >99% complete
(Supporting Information, Table S-4). Even
after 24 h, the signal for the thio compound remained undiminished.
Thus, the reaction was quantitative and fast (<11 min), and the
product was stabile in solution for at least 1 day. In view of the
ease of the derivatization and the ensuing chromatographic advantages,
further steps in the method development were performed on the thio
derivatives of the arsenolipids.

Identification and Quantification of Seven Major Arsenolipids
in CRM Hijiki
The optimized method incorporating DCM/MeOH
extraction, silica cleanup and thio derivatization was then applied
to the CRM Hijiki. We checked the recovery of the whole procedure
by spiking the CRM Hijiki with two standard compounds AsHC332 and
AsHC360, and found recoveries of 101 ± 6% and 85 ± 13% (n = 3), respectively (Figure 4).
The lower precision obtained for AsHC360 reflected its much lower
concentration in Hijiki compared with AsHC332 (90 ± 5 ng As g–1 versus 1073 ± 44 ng As g–1, each n = 3). In addition to the two arsenic hydrocarbons,
five arsenosugar phospholipids were also identified by HPLC-high resolution
MS (Figure 5). The advantage of the silica
column cleanup step is demonstrated by the improvement in the chromatogram
(Figure 5a and 5b).
The compounds were concurrently quantified by ICPMS detection and
in the case of the two AsHCs, for which standards were available,
also by ESMS detection (Table 3). The lack
of standards for AsPLs precluded our obtaining quantitative data by
using HPLC-ESMS, which could have been used to support the ICPMS data.
Although quantification by ICPMS can be performed without the specific
arsenolipid standard (since signal response depends primarily on the
arsenic content, independent of species), the values for the AsPLs
might be compromised by possible coelution with other arsenic-containing
species.

In summary, we report a method for the quantification of arsenolipids
in the reference material CRM 7405-a (Hijiki), which has been previously
certified for total arsenic and inorganic arsenic(V). The CRM is a
readily available, characterized source of arsenolipids to assist
research requiring the analysis of these new and fascinating marine
natural products, which occur in many common types of seafood.
