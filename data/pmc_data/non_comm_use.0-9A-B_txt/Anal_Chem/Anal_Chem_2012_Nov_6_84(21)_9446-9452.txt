Neuropeptides are synthesized in and released from neurons
and
are involved in a wide range of physiological processes, including
temperature homeostasis, learning, memory, and disease. When working
with sparse neuronal networks, the ability to collect and characterize
small sample volumes is important as neurons often release only a
small proportion of their mass-limited content. Microfluidic systems
are well suited for the study of neuropeptides. They offer the ability
to control and manipulate the extracellular environment and small
sample volumes, thereby reducing the dilution of peptides following
release. We present an approach for the culture and stimulation of
a neuronal network within a microfluidic device, subsequent collection
of the released peptides, and their detection via mass spectrometry.
The system employs microvalve-controlled stimulation channels to selectively
stimulate a low-density neuronal culture, allowing us to determine
the temporal onset of peptide release. Released peptides from the
well-characterized, peptidergic bag cell neurons of Aplysia
californica were collected and their temporal pattern of
release was characterized with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We show a robust difference in the
timing of release for chemical solutions containing elevated K+ (7 ± 3 min), when compared to insulin (19 ± 7 min)
(p < 0.000 01).

==== Body
Neuropeptides are an important
class of signaling molecules that are involved in cell-to-cell communication
in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. They are synthesized
and stored in neurons and, upon stimulation, are exocytotically released
from the cells to function as neurotransmitters, neuromodulators,
trophic factors, and neurohormones. Known to influence a wide range
of physiological processes, neuropeptides influence learning and memory,
food intake, pain, and disease.1−3 Identifying neuropeptides that
both establish and enrich neuron–neuron interactions and understanding
the physical and chemical conditions necessary for their release will
aid in uncovering the key effectors of formation and repair in neural
networks. Characterizing neuropeptide release in vitro from low-density culturing environments allows cells of interest
to be isolated from their potentially heterogeneous neighbors, which
oftentimes contain a different chemical complement from nearby cells.4

The study of neuropeptide signaling can
be challenging; because
only a fraction of the mass-limited neuropeptide content of a cell
is released after stimulation, sample amounts can be low. Furthermore,
in the commonly employed dish-based culturing systems, released peptides
are diluted by orders of magnitude before collection, rendering their
characterization difficult. There is a need for neuronal culture,
collection, and detection systems that both identify released neuropeptides
and provide information regarding release conditions. Here we describe
an approach to maintain a neuronal network in a controlled environment,
selectively apply chemical stimulations, collect peptide releasate
with minimal dilution, and couple the releasate collection to off-line
mass spectrometry (MS) for peptide characterization.

Microfluidic
devices are well suited for examining neuropeptide
release. With the evolution of microvalves, fluid control, surface
patterning, and chemical gradients, these devices provide the ability
to precisely control the microenvironments around neurons while significantly
reducing sample volumes.5−8 By enabling detection of these mass-limited samples,
we gain a broader understanding of peptide release conditions. Additionally,
these devices offer a number of advantages that improve cell culture:
biocompatibility, gas permeability, and optical transparency.

In recent years, progress has been made toward integrating microfluidics
and neuroscience with cell culture, manipulation, and electrophysiology
studies.9−13 Compartmentalized devices fluidically isolate cell bodies from processes,
allowing these structures to be examined separately.14 Whole Caenorhabditis elegans, the well-studied
neural development model, have been placed in microfluidic chambers
for the interrogation of a number of factors, including odor recognition
and Ca2+ imaging,15,16 dynamic cellular processes,17 and high throughput genes and drug screening.18 Finally, several devices have been employed
to study the injury and regeneration of neuron processes as well as
to model disease within a device.19−21 While microfluidic technologies
have been used to address a wide range of topics in neuroscience,
little of this research has involved the investigation of neuropeptides.

A number of detection platforms have been used to investigate neuropeptide
release, including enzyme immunoassays, radioimmunoassays, and capillary
electrophoresis coupled to laser-induced fluorescence.22,23 While highly sensitive and quantitative, these techniques require
analyte preselection prior to analysis, followed by either a derivatization
procedure to render the peptide fluorescent or the creation of an
antibody. In contrast, MS provides high sensitivity and information
content for the entire peptide complement, without analyte preselection.
Matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization (MALDI) MS offers high
salt tolerances and a relative ease of coupling to microfluidics.
For all of these reasons, MS has proven to be a great detection platform
for peptide release studies.24−27

We present a microfluidic design that allows
the user to selectively
apply chemical stimulations to neurons maintained in the device. The
resulting neuropeptide releasates are collected off-line and detected
with MALDI- time-of-flight (TOF)-MS. This approach provides information
regarding peptide release content and the physiological conditions
necessary for release. Previously, we reported several devices that
employed MALDI-MS imaging to collect and quantify neuropeptides on
chip.28,29 In this study, we achieve further control
over the extracellular microenvironment by creating a microvalve-controlled
device that exposes a low-density neural network to measured time
periods of exposure to a defined chemical stimulation. With the added
temporal control over stimulation and collection, the onset of peptide
release can be determined and compared. By collecting peptide releasates
and characterizing them via MS, off-chip, multiple-day stimulations
can be performed on the same neural network and the specific released
peptides can be characterized. Bag cell neurons from the marine mollusk Aplysia californica are widely used in neuropeptide studies.
We exposed these neurons to both general and bag cell-specific chemical
stimulations, followed by the subsequent collection and detection
of peptide releasates. We observed both the onset and refractory period
of bag cell peptide release for elevated K+ and insulin
exposures; our results show a robust difference in the time frame
required to detect peptides after exposure to distinct chemicals.

Experimental Section
Reagents
Chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO), and organic solvents were purchased from Fisher Scientific
(Fairlawn, NJ) unless otherwise noted. The polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
prepolymer kit, Sylgard 184, was purchased from Dow Corning (Midland,
MI). 2-[Methoxy(polyethyleneoxy)propyl]trimethoxysilane (OEG, 90%)
was purchased from Gelest, Inc. (Morrisville, PA). Filtered artificial
seawater (ASW, pH 7.8) contained 460 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 22 mM MgCl2, 26 mM MgSO4, 2.5 mM NaHCO3, and 15 mM HEPES. Negative photoresist SU-8 2075 and developer
were obtained from MicroChem Corp. (Newtown, MA). Positive photoresist
AZ 4620 and developer were from AZ Electronic Materials Corp. (Somerville,
NJ).

Device Fabrication
The device consists of two separate
layers, a flow channel and a pressure channel layer. Silicon masters
were prepared using a traditional photolithographic process as reported
previously.30,31 The flow channel master was made
with AZ4620 photoresist to a height of 25 μm. Wafers were heated
to 200 °C for 20 min to create rounded corners in the channels.
Octadecyltrichlorosilane was evaporated onto the wafer for 4 h or
longer to allow for the removal of PDMS from the wafer. For the pressure
channel master, SU-8 2075 photoresist was spun and patterned to make
channels 100 μm in height. Small pieces of silicone tubing (Helix
Medical, Carpinteria, CA) were glued onto the SU-8 features on the
master. Uncured 20:1 PDMS was spun onto the flow channel master at
2050 rpm for 60 s; 5:1 PDMS was poured onto the pressure channel master.
Both masters were allowed to partially cure at 70 °C until just
set. Then both PDMS blocks were aligned and adhered together and cured
at 90 °C overnight. The main reservoir and outlet were made with
an AcuPunch biopsy punch (Acuderm, Inc., Ft. Lauderdale, FL) of 1
mm. The PDMS block was then adhered to a 30 mm cell culture dish (Greiner
Bio-One, Monroe, NC), and uncured PDMS was poured around the device
to prevent leakage. The device was cured again at 70 °C for 1
h and both the flow and pressure channels were filled with ASW. Pressure
channels were connected to an in-house built pneumatic solenoid valve
system that is controlled by LabView software (National Instruments,
Austin, TX). The program controls the application or removal of pressure
to the pressure channels for closing or opening the channels, respectively.

To reduce analyte losses into the PDMS material,29,32 channels were treated with 5:1:1 H2O/HCl/H2O2 for 5 min, rinsed with deionized water (DI; Milli-Q
Biocel, Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA) for 5 min, OEG for 30
min, and finally flushed with DI water for a minimum of 4 h to yield
OEGylated PDMS, as described previously.33 Prior to use, PDMS devices were washed with methanol and dried with
N2.

Cell Culture Experiments
Aplysia californica (100–150 g; National Resource for Aplysia, Miami, FL) were anesthetized by injecting 390 mM of MgCl2 equal to 1/2 the animal’s body weight. The abdominal ganglia
was dissected and incubated at 34 °C in ASW containing 10 mg/mL
protease from Streptomyces griseus, 60 mg/L penicillin
G, 100 mg/L streptomycin, and 100 mg/L gentamicin for 90 min. This
treatment of the ganglia allows for removal of the connective tissue
surrounding the bag cell neurons. Individual bag cell neurons were
then isolated and loaded into the main reservoir of the microfluidic
device. A small, thin piece of PDMS was placed over the main reservoir
to direct flow through the flow channels. Cells were cultured in ASW
for 24 h prior to stimulation experiments.

Stimulation Experiments
Two syringes, containing either
a solution of 60 mM of KCl in ASW or 5 μM of insulin in ASW,
were attached to a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA)
and connected to the stimulation channels on the device. A syringe
filled with ASW connected another syringe pump to the inlet reservoir.
Pre- and postcontrols were performed with ASW as cell culture media.
Each series of chemical stimulation measurements was performed on
a network of cultured cells in the microfluidic device. Both the ASW
and chemical stimulation solution were flowed through the device at
a flow rate of 0.5–1 μL/min. When ASW was flowed, the
microvalves were closed to prohibit chemical stimulation solution
from entering the channels. When chemical stimulations flowed through
the device, ASW flow was stopped and the microvalves opened. Small
pieces of silicone tubing connected the pressure channels to an in-house
built solenoid valve system. Prior to cell loading, each pressure
channel was filled with water to prevent bubble formation in the channels.
If bubbles entered the channels, a small amount of negative pressure
was applied to the channel to remove them. During each stimulation
experiment, cells were visualized to monitor cell viability with an
inverted fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc. Peabody, MA).

Sample Preparation and Mass Spectrometric Detection
Sample solutions exited the device through polytetrafluoroethylene
tubing (Cole Palmer Instrument Company, Vernon Hills, IL) and between
10 and 20 μL of sample were collected and then desalted and
concentrated using ZipTip C18 pipet tips (Millipore, Billerica,
MA) according to manufacturer instructions. Briefly, the ZipTip was
wetted with 100% acetonitrile (ACN), equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) in deionized water, loaded with sample containing 0.1%
TFA, washed with 5% methanol/0.1% TFA in deionized water, and eluted
onto a ground steel MALDI target (Bruker Daltonics Inc., Billerica,
MA) first with 50% ACN and then with 75% ACN solutions. Samples were
then combined with 50 mg/mL 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix in 1:1
acetone/water for analysis. An ultrafleXtreme TOF mass spectrometer
(Bruker Daltonics) in the reflectron mode was used to analyze peptide
releasates. Mass calibration was performed with peptide calibration
standard II (Bruker Daltonics). Between 500 and 1500 shots were collected
per spot. Individual mass spectra were analyzed with flexAnalysis
(version 3.3, Bruker Daltonics).

Results and Discussion
Device Design and Fabrication
The goal of this work
was to create a small-volume cell culturing region that allows neuronal
network formation and access to cells. Fluidics were added to enable
the extracellular media to be exchanged with various solutions (media
or stimulation solutions) and a collection port/channel to enable
off-line sample characterization, in this case via MS. In order to
enable temporal control of the media surrounding the cells, we used
microvalve-controlled stimulation channels (Figure 1A).

Bottom layer (blue) denotes the flow channels whereas the top layer
(red) denotes the pressure channels. (B) Image of an ink solution
in the stimulation channels with both valves closed. Ink is not observed
in the main channel, indicating that valves fluidically isolate stimulation
solutions from the main channel. Scale bar = 500 μm. (C) Representative
bag cell culture after 1 DIV. Neurons cultured in the device appear
viable and form networks. Scale bar = 100 μm.

The main and outlet reservoirs are 1 mm in diameter;
this reduces
dilution within the device while allowing for effective fluid flow.
The main reservoir serves as the cell culture chamber and is open
for cell loading (and physiological recordings, if necessary). Flow
channels are 200 μm wide by 50 μm high and rounded; pressure
channels are 200 μm wide by 100 μm high. Pressure channels
can be selectively opened (or closed) to allow for chemical stimulation
additions to the cultured neurons within the device. Studies were
performed with colored ink solutions (as shown in Figure 1B) to verify that this arrangement allows fluidic isolation
between the stimulation channels and the main channel. PDMS channels
are OEGylated to reduce peptide losses into the PDMS.29 The culture chamber is where the neurons are cultured and
form the network.

Cell Culture
A significant amount of chemical heterogeneity
exists among different cell types and, perhaps surprisingly, even
among cell populations that are considered to be homogeneous. One
of the challenges in studying high-density or larger cultures is due
to the small chemical differences that can be lost when measurement
approaches report average values from within a high-density cell population.
There are a number of reports documenting high-density cultures in
microfluidic devices,34−37 but significantly fewer protocols exist for low-density cultures.
While individual cells can be assayed for their peptide contents using
MS,24,25,38,39 chemical signaling requires multiple cells and so
sparse neuronal networks appear to be of the appropriate scale for
investigation of signaling networks using microfluidics. For these
reasons, we fabricated a device that is capable of maintaining low-density
cultures. Each device reported here contained 10–20 bag cell
neurons that were removed from the animal and cultured for 24 h prior
to stimulation experiments. A representative image of a bag cell culture
is shown in Figure 1C; this image shows the
cells forming a network with putative chemical or electrical connections
between the neurons. Even after 1 day in vitro (DIV),
neurons appeared healthy and viable with long process growth and network
formation. Cells can be maintained for at least 12 DIV (data not shown)
with media changes, allowing for multiple-day stimulation experiments
on the same cell cluster in the device.

Elevated K+ Stimulation
Following cell culture,
neurons within a device were exposed to media that was known or expected
to cause the release of peptides. Elevated K+ acts as a
secretagogue, which causes the exocytosis of neurotransmitters from
a neuron through the depolarization of the cell membrane.40 The addition of K+ to bag cell neurons
and the detection of peptide release have been extensively studied,
and their subsequent peptide profiles have been widely documented.29,41−44 Therefore, A. californica provides an excellent
model for validating this system; by observing known released peptides,
we validate device function. To that end, nine different devices,
with each containing a different network of bag cell neurons, were
subjected to increasing time periods of K+ exposure (Figure 2). A pre- and postcontrol was performed on each
group of neurons with ASW before and after chemical stimulation, respectively.
ASW is a minimal culture media (as it contains the required inorganic
ions) and should not elicit peptide release. We did not observe peptide
release with the addition of ASW, which suggests that we did not induce
release via flow-induced stress and motions across the culture chamber
or by damaging the cells upon chemical stimulation.

Figure 2 Series of representative
mass spectra of bag cell neuron peptide
release following KCl stimulation at increasing stimulation exposure
times. A number of previously identified peptides from the bag cell
neurons were observed following 5 min of exposure to KCl (βBCP, m/z 728.4; αBCP1–7,m/z 922.5; αBCP, m/z 1122.6; AP, m/z 2959.5; pELH30–43, m/z 1471.8; δBCP1–36, m/z 4022.7; δBCP, m/z 4406.9). On the right of the mass spectra are
an example of a time course for the chemical stimulation protocol
series. Red bars represent chemical stimulation addition; gray bars
indicate ASW addition. Each exposure was 40 min in duration with stimulation
time and ASW addition varying. Two collections were done during each
exposure time at t = 20 min and t = 40 min.

Each neural network was exposed to elevated K+ for a
combination of exposure times. For example, a group of neurons may
have been exposed to K+ for 1 min, 3 min, 5 min, 10 min,
and 20 min or a subset of these exposure times, sequentially, with
ASW as the pre- and postcontrol. Following each stimulation exposure,
the microvalves were closed and ASW was flowed through the device
until the total time reached 40 min, allowing any released peptides
to be washed out of the device for collection. Solutions were collected
twice during the 40 min period to gain additional temporal release
information. After collection, samples were desalted and concentrated
with C18 pipet tips and eluted onto a MALDI target for
analysis.

In this study, nine different groups of bag cell neurons,
each
in separate devices, received increasing periods of K+ stimulations
and peptide release was detected. The resulting mass spectra were
collected twice during each exposure time. Figure 2 shows a representative series of intensity-normalized mass
spectra following 1, 3, 5, and 10 min exposures to K+.
A number of well-studied peptides were detected following 5 min of
K+ exposure, demonstrating that a 5 min exposure is sufficient
to cause release. In general, peptide release was observed in both
20 min collections after the 5 min stimulation period (n = 4; out of seven devices where peptide release was observed). Peptides
were not observed in the pre- and postconditions, indicating that
the shear stress caused by flow does not stimulate or lyse the cells.
Because of its relatively good detection limits compared with the
other egg-laying hormone-related peptides, the detection of acidic
peptide (m/z 2959.5) at S/N ≥
5 was used to indicate when peptide release had occurred. Figure 3 shows the percentage of the time that acidic peptide
was detected versus the elevated K+ exposure time.

Figure 3 Percentage
of the time that acidic peptide (m/z 2959.5), a known peptide of the bag cell neurons from Aplysia
californica, is detected versus stimulation exposure
time for KCl and insulin. The n represents the number
of distinct repeats (individual devices containing a distinct network
of neurons) used that were stimulated for the indicated time. Stimulation
time courses were varied to demonstrate that peptide release is independent
of previously applied stimulations to the cells. (Top) 5 min of KCl
exposure time was necessary to elicit peptide release 79% of the time.
(Bottom) 20 min of insulin exposure was necessary to elicit peptide
release 88% of the time.

Regardless of previously applied K+,
exposure to 5 min
of K+ resulted in the observance of release 80% of the
time, whereas, when the same neurons were exposed to K+ for a shorter period (<5 min), release was detected less than
50% of the time. This demonstrates that exposure times of less than
5 min usually did not elicit release. For subsequent exposure periods
(>5 min), acidic peptide detection decreased. In part, this decrease
is due to the refractory period that bag cells enter following release.44 During this period, regardless of the length
of stimulation applied, the cells are not able to sustain peptide
release. Since bag cell neurons are involved in reproduction, this
refractory period is consistent with the fact that the animals can
only lay eggs periodically. Furthermore, this shows that the temporal
resolution of our platform is able to capture both the onset of peptide
release and the refractory period after release. We did observe differences
in the temporal aspects of release between experiments, which may
represent differences in the release dynamics between individual animals.

Insulin Stimulation
Elevated K+ is a general
secretagogue that causes release of vesicles (including dense core
vesicles containing peptides) in a neuron through the depolarization
of the cell membrane. Therefore, it should elicit release from most,
if not all, neuronal subtypes. In contrast with the depolarization
caused by K+, which directly affects potassium channels,
insulin is a cell-specific chemical stimulation that is internalized
through the phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases.45,46 Therefore, cells without this receptor will not respond to insulin
application. Previous studies have shown that bag cell neurons contain
insulin receptors.47 Unlike the widely
accepted model of neurotransmitter exocytosis, which involves the
influx of external Ca2+, bag cell neurons are unusual because
the release of intracellular Ca2+ (such as caused by insulin
exposure) is enough to result in peptide secretion.48 The application of 5 μM of mammalian insulin causes
peptide release through such an extracellular Ca2+-independent
process.48 While the structure of mammalian
insulin is distinct from Aplysia insulin peptides,
it is similar enough to still function in Aplysia.39,47,48 To demonstrate
that the networks maintained in our device exhibit a similar physiology
to semi-intact animals in previous reports39,47,48 and to document that small numbers of bag
cell neurons in our reduced network respond to insulin (something
not shown before), nine additional devices, each containing a distinct
network of bag cell neurons, were exposed to increasing periods of
insulin to determine the temporal dynamics of peptide release. In
contrast to K+, 20 min of insulin exposure was necessary
to detect peptide release. The slower response is not surprising given
that insulin-evoked release may require peptide internalization, a
process that is expected to take longer than the release induced via
potassium ions.

In addition to acidic peptide, a number of egg
laying hormone-related peptides were detected (Figure 4). It was previously reported that internal Ca2+ increases within 5–20 min of exposure to insulin.48 Our data agrees with this; at least 20 min was
necessary for peptide release to occur. Furthermore, in the majority
of devices where release occurred following 20 min of insulin exposure,
peptides were only observed in the first collection (n = 4; out of 7 devices where peptide release was observed). Devices
where peptides were collected in both 20 min collections, signal intensities
were at least 2.5 times greater in the first collection (n = 3; out of 7 devices where peptide release was observed).

Figure 4 Representative
mass spectrum of peptide release following 20 min
of insulin exposure (αBCP1–7,m/z = 922.5; αBCP, m/z = 1122.6; AP8–27, m/z = 2316.2; AP, m/z = 2959.5; δBCP1–36, m/z = 4022.7; δBCP, m/z = 4406.9).

Jonas et al.48 showed
that the egg-laying
hormone (which is stored in the same peptidergic vesicle that contains
acidic peptide) was released following insulin application. However,
their use of radioimmunoassay required the preselection of one particular
peptide of interest. MS allows us to view an entire complement of
released peptides. The egg laying hormone prohormone, the source of
these peptides, has a tetrabasic site that is cleaved prior to vesicle
packaging, resulting in the N- and C-terminal ends of the prohormone
being packaged into distinct vesicles.49

The α, β, and γ-bag cell peptides are located
near the N-terminus of the egg laying prohormone, and acidic peptide
and egg laying hormone are located near the C terminus and each are
packaged into these two peptide-containing vesicle populations. We
observed both N- and C-terminal peptides, indicating that both types
of vesicles are released upon insulin stimulation, at least under
our culturing conditions. Furthermore, insulin [M + 2H]2+ was observed for all exposure periods. This demonstrates that the
stimulation solution fills the device in the time allotted for exposure.

Acidic peptide detection versus exposure time was again plotted
to show the amount of insulin exposure time necessary for peptide
release. Our observations were robust, with acidic peptide being detected
88% of the time following 20 min of exposure, whereas release was
detected less than 50% of the time following a shorter insulin exposure.
Similar to the refractory period seen with K+ stimulations,
we observed fewer peptides in the 30 min exposure period.

In
the study done by Jonas et al.,48 entire
bag cell clusters, each containing hundreds of cells, were
perfused with insulin for 70 min. They found that the amount of insulin-induced
peptide release was similar to that of an afterdischarge. Their application
of electrical stimulation would resemble our application of K+, in that both trigger action potentials and an afterdischarge.
Here, we show our ability to see peptide release following both K+ and insulin exposure. However, our microfluidic valve system
enables release studies from significantly fewer cells with higher
temporal resolution. This increase in temporal resolution shows that
two similar peptide releases (in terms of amount and peptide content)
have different kinetics and, presumably, biochemical pathways.

Conclusions
Overall, this approach can maintain a neuronal
culture and detect
peptide release following appropriate physiological stimulations.
The difference in exposure time necessary to elicit peptide release
between K+ and insulin demonstrates that by further controlling
the microenvironment, we can gain a greater understanding of the conditions
necessary for peptide release to occur. This knowledge increases our
ability to apply essential molecules of repair to restore function
to a damaged neural network. The ease of fabrication and cell culture,
as well as the coupling to MS, make this device readily amenable to
many neuronal types.

The system demonstrated here can be extended
to work with other
cell types and culturing platforms to enable the interface of culturing,
stimulation, and release characterization. Potential enhancements
include the ability to quantify the amount of peptides released such
as via the approach for Zhong et al.29 or
other direct MS approaches such as the method described by Rubakhin
and Sweedler.50 In addition, via appropriate
interfacing to CE–laser induced fluorescence (LIF)51−53 and CE–MS,54,55 more complete characterization
of the extracellular media can be performed. Finally, as this system
is transparent and contains an accessible culturing platform, future
efforts can include Ca2+ imaging or electrophysiology to
enable a new range of studies on neuronal release dynamics.
