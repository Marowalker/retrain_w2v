An organic lateral resolution test
device has been developed to
measure the performance of imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) systems.
The device contains periodic gratings of polyethylene glycol (PEG)
and lipid bars covering a wide range of spatial frequencies. Microfabrication
technologies were employed to produce well-defined chemical interfaces,
which allow lateral resolution to be assessed using the edge-spread
function (ESF). In addition, the design of the device allows for the
direct measurement of the modulation transfer function (MTF) to assess
image quality. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and time-of-flight
secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) were used to characterize
the device. TOF-SIMS imaging was used to measure the chemical displacement
of biomolecules in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)
matrix crystals. In a proof-of-concept experiment, the platform was
also used to evaluate MALDI matrix application methods, specifically
aerosol spray and sublimation methods.

==== Body
Imaging mass
spectrometry (IMS)
is a powerful method used to map the spatial distributions of chemicals
in biological materials.1 The method encompasses
a number of ionization techniques, including matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization (MALDI),2 desorption
electrospray ionization (DESI),3 and secondary
ion mass spectrometry (SIMS),4 each with
unique advantages and challenges in the imaging modality.3 All imaging systems contain components that blur
the resulting image and limit the lateral resolution of the technique.
In IMS, the beam size and shape, detection scheme, secondary ion optics,
stage or rastering alignment, step size/pixel size, ion signal-to-noise
intensity, and chromatic aberration of the beam are all potential
sources of image degradation. Spatial resolution limits down to 7
μm for MALDI,5 200 μm for DESI,3 and 50 nm for SIMS6 have recently been reported, and efforts to improve these values
are the subject of ongoing research.7−9

Sensitivity is
one of the largest factors limiting the lateral
resolution in imaging mass spectrometry, especially for single cell
analyses.9−11 The useful lateral resolution, ΔL, can be described giving the minimum pixel size that yields a selected
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). Thus,
in the case of Poisson counting statistics, 1  where I is the intensity
of the signal and S/N is the signal-to-noise
ratio.12,13 Simply, the useful lateral resolution, ΔL, is the length of a pixel needed to produce a detectable
signal, typically S/N > 3. This
fact emphasizes the relationship between sensitivity and image quality
and, hence, the need to assess both parameters when evaluating the
performances of an imaging system.

In this context, in order
to identify losses in image quality and
assess their effect on IMS-based image quality, a lateral resolution
reference material is required. Reference materials are commonly employed
in the SIMS community to characterize spatial resolution.14−17 The BAM-L200 nanopatterned certified reference material is composed
of metallic species (i.e., indium, gallium, arsenic, and aluminum),15 which makes it an ideal target for SIMS but
incompatible with MALDI and DESI analyses. Since MALDI often requires
cocrystallization of the matrix with the anayte and DESI requires
the dissolution of analyte in desorbed droplets, the chemical nature
of this reference material makes it an unsuitable target for evaluating
MALDI and DESI imaging. Patterns printed with an inkjet printer have
been successfully employed to evaluate spatial lateral resolution
in DESI3 and electrostatic spray imaging.18 However, to date, this method has not been employed
to evaluate image quality in MALDI imaging systems. There is an obvious
need for fundamental MALDI imaging investigations. For example, without
a reliable reference material, it is difficult to gauge improvements
to lateral resolution and image quality afforded by emerging technologies.7,19−21

In this paper, the development of an organic
lateral resolution
test device to measure the performance of IMS systems is presented.
The device is specifically designed for the quick assessment of the
lateral resolution for various IMS technologies. Microfabrication
techniques have been used to pattern the surface of the device.22 A device with periodic gratings of polyethylene
glycol (PEG) and untethered lipid features ranging from a few micrometers
to a millimeter and sharp “chemical edges” (i.e., no
diffusive chemical mixing) between the PEG and lipids regions was
produced. The test device was used as a platform to assess the blurring
of the measured image, taking advantages of its known characteristics.
In addition, the chemical displacement of untethered lipids during
MALDI matrix application has been observed with this new device. We
show that, in some cases, lipids can migrate as far as 16 ± 15
μm away from their initial position after matrix application.

Theory
In this section, we detail the different methods typically used
to analyze the resolution of an imaging system. Resolution, the ability
to distinguish two adjacent features, is an indicator of image quality.
The ability of the imaging system to adequately transfer features
from the object to an image is limited by several blur-inducing parameters.
Briefly, as detailed in the Supporting Information, SI-1, an image can be described as the convolution of the object
with the impulse function of the imaging system (typically, a Gaussian-shaped
curve).23 The images obtained from a point,
line, or edge (i.e., the point spread function (PSF), line spread
function (LSF), and edge spread function (ESF)) can be used to evaluate
blurring induced by the imaging system and hence assess the limit
resolution of the system (details are given in the Supporting Information). Once the amount of blurring is determined,
the minimum distance required to distinguish two features in an image,
or lateral resolution, can be evaluated.

The de facto standard methods used to measure
spatial resolution in imaging technologies are typically derived from
the LSF or ESF. For IMS, particularly SIMS, the width of the incident
beam is often used to approximate lateral resolution. For practical
purposes, the beam profile is often approximated by a model function,
typically a Gaussian profile, characterized by its standard deviation,
σ, or its full width half-maximum (fwhm) which is approximated
by 2(2 ln(2))1/2σ.24 The
ESF (see details in the Supporting Information, SI-2) conveniently gives access to these parameters. Indeed, the
ESF is obtained by the convolution of an edge profile with a Gaussian
beam function, resulting in an image profile described by the error
function, erf. As shown below in the Results and
Discussion section, a linescan can be obtained across the edge
of a chemical feature, thus leading to the recording of the ESF, which
is then fitted with an error function, 2  where Imax and Imin are
the maximum and minimum ion intensities
and σ is a parameter describing the width of the ESF. In this
case, the fwhm is equal to the Δ88–12%, (i.e.,
the distance separating the points of the scan where the signal is
12% and 88% of its original intensity).24 3  

Unfortunately,
the method detailed above does not consider the
effect sensitivity has on image resolution. Near the limit of detection,
for a particular analyte, lateral resolution is no longer limited
by the width of the beam but by the intensity of signal. The inability
of an imaging systems or mass spectrometer to detect variation in
the signal intensities is reflected in the contrast of the resulting
image. The contrast, C, of an ion image is defined
as 4  where Imax and Imin are the maximum
and minimum intensities
measured in an image. The contrast of the image relative to the object
is known as the modulation transfer function (MTF),25−27 5  where Cimage(f) and Cobject(f) are the spatial frequency
of the image and object, respectively.
The object contrast, Cobject(f), is assumed to be 1 because of the discrete repartition of the
different chemical components. As detailed in the Supporting Information, the MTF can be calculated from the
ESF and used to evaluate beam width.

Experimental Section
Microfabrication
The mask, a 4 in. quartz crystal coated
with a layer of chromium, was produced at the Nanofabrication Laboratory,
Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience at Chalmers University
of Technology. The mask contained five copies of the pattern, presented
in Figure 1A.

resolution test device.
(B) Schematic of the lithography process. (C) Schematic depicting
the functionalization of the gold–silicon pattern with organic
molecules, PEG, and lipid.

The silicon wafers (3 in. diameter) were washed in Milli-Q
deionized
water (Millipore AB, Solna, Sweden, >18 MΩ cm). Organic residues
were removed with a base piranha etch (3:1 mixture of ammonium hydroxide
and hydrogen peroxide). (CAUTION: “Piranha” solution
reacts violently with organic materials; it must be handled with extreme
care.) The silicon wafers
were then washed 3 times in deionized water, dried with nitrogen,
and spin-coated with UV5 positive DUV photo resist (3000 rpm for 60
s). The photoresist coated silicon wafer was prebaked on a hot plate
at 135 °C for 3 min. The DUV photolithography mask aligner (KS
MJB3-DUV, Karl Suss) was operated at 220 nm with an intensity of 2.2
mW/cm2. The sample was irradiated for 4 s and then baked
at 130 °C for 90 s (Figure 1B, step 1).
The developer (0.26 N) was used to remove all the non-cross-linked
material (Figure 1B, step 2). Again, the silicon
wafer was washed in deionized water and dried with nitrogen. The wafer
was sputter coated with a thin layer of titanium followed by a thin
layer of gold (Figure 1B, step 3). A standard
lift off technique was used to remove the photoresist (Figure 1B, step 4), leaving a gold and silicon patterned
surface.

Functionalization
Before functionalization, the surface
of the IMS test device was cleaned in a solution containing deionized
water, ammonia, and hydrogen peroxide (3:1:1 v/v) for 30 min at 60
°C. The IMS test device was washed with deionized water and dried
with nitrogen. The IMS test device was incubated overnight (an excess
of 18 h) in a 10 mg/mL solution of methoxy-PEG thiol 2000 (Sigma-Aldrich)
in ethanol (99.5%), as shown in Figure 1C,
step 1. The substrate was washed with ethanol, then washed with deionized
water, and dried under nitrogen gas. The troughs were filled with
lipids by immersing the test device in a solution of liposomes, 1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [PC(16:0/16:0)], and cholesterol
(Avanti Polar Lipids, USA), followed by multiple washes to remove
lipids deposited on the PEG (Figure 1C, step
2). Details for the preparation of the liposome solution are provided
in the Supporting Information, SI-3.

Matrix Deposition
The matrix solution contained 30
mg/mL 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) in deionized water/methanol
(1:1, v/v) solvent with 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The matrix
was applied using the ImagePrep (Bruker, Germany) automated spray
device (see details in the Supporting Information, SI-4).

Instrumentation
A TOF.SIMS 5 mass spectrometer (ION-TOF,
Münster, Germany) was used for the time-of-flight secondary
ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) analyses. A pulsed 25 keV Bi3+ primary ion source was used as the analysis beam
(pulse width = 23 ns, mass resolution m/Δm = 5000). For the high lateral resolution imaging, pulse
width = 100 ns and mass resolution m/Δm = 500 were used. The primary ion dose was kept below the
static limit (1013 primary ions/cm2). Data was
collected in the positive ion mode.

MALDI data was acquired
on an UltrafleXtreme MALDI instrument (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Germany)
equipped with a Nd:YAG smartbeam II laser (355 nm). The instrument
was operated in the reflectron mode. Positive ions were detected from
300 Da to 3 kDa. The laser power was optimized on the sample before
the data acquisition. For the MTF analysis, the “small”
laser focus setting (20 μm spot size) was used at a 50 μm
step size. 1000 laser shots were acquired at each shot at a 1 kHz
repetition rate.

Data Processing
MATLAB, OriginPro,
and ImageJ software
were used in the analysis of the images and the linescans. Where applicable,
numerical results are reported as average ± standard deviation
(SD). All of the ion images and spectra were normalized to the most
intense pixel and peak, respectively. Additional image processing
protocols are provided in the Supporting Information.

Results and Discussion
Device Design
The IMS lateral resolution
prototype
test device contains alternating bars of PEG and lipid at various
spatial frequencies (see Figure 1A). The device
covers a large functional range to accommodate DESI-, MALDI-, and
SIMS-based imaging. The pattern consists of three tiers; the period
grating (1 PEG bar + 1 lipid bar) increases by 2n micrometers, where n is a natural number, for bars
below 10 μm, by 20n micrometers for bars between
10 and 100 μm, and by 200n micrometers for
bars between 100 μm and 1 mm. The pattern is reversible, producing
the same pattern with both positive and negative photoresists. The
transitions between the three tiers are easily located and are useful
in determining a position on the device. The total size of the pattern
is ∼11 × 10 mm.

Characterization of the Unfunctionalized
Test Device
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to
characterize the test
device substrate before it was functionalized with organic compounds.
As shown in the SEM images, Figure 2A,B, the
microfabrication process successfully produced sharp interfaces between
the gold and silicon surface regions. The smallest feature on the
test device was a 3.0 μm silicon bar followed by a 4.0 μm
gold bar. Artifacts from the lift off procedure can be seen on the
SEM images, Figure 2C,D. In some areas, excess
gold was present causing the gold layer to curl back at the interface.
These features were relatively small, less than 250 nm in width, and
had a negligible impact on the TOF-SIMS images. Linescans across the
Au/SiO2 interface were obtained to assess the sharpness
of the microfabricated bars. To do so, the section of the linescan
at the interface was fitted to a sigmoidal curve (see eq 2 and Figure 2E). The Δ88%–12% was measured to be 53 nm, a value sufficiently below achievable
lateral resolution of most IMS techniques. Therefore, the edges of
the device were sharp enough to conclude that any additional loss
in resolution would be the result of the imaging technique, not the
device.

linescan. (C) A zoomed-in SEM image of the 3 and 4 μm bars and

gold and silicon surface was fitted to the error function; the Δ88%–12% lateral resolution was measured to be 53 nm.

TOF-SIMS Analyses of the
Functionalized Test Device
TOF-SIMS analyses were performed
on the functionalized test device,
and the resulting mass spectra, corresponding to two chemical regions,
are shown in Figure 3A. The most intense peaks
in the PEG region correspond to the protonated monomer at m/z 45 [C2H4O + H]+, polymer fragments at m/z 107 [(C2H4O)2 + H2O
+ H]+, and unknown species at m/z 109. The most intense peaks in the lipid regions correspond
to the PC headgroup fragments at m/z 86 [C5H12N]+ and m/z 184 [C5H15NO4P]+. TOF-SIMS images of the device show alternating bars
of PEG and lipid. As expected, the gold regions were successfully
covered with PEG and the SiO2 regions were filled with
lipid (see Figure 3B). The intensity of a selected
ion was summed along the axis parallel to the bars to produce a linescan
(see Figure 3C). The full width at half-maximum
(fwhm) of the peaks in the linescan was used to estimate the width
of the bars (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information, SI-5).

Figure 3 (A) Mass spectra obtained from the two distinct chemical regions
of the device; the PEG (blue, top) and lipid (green, bottom) regions.
(B) TOF-SIMS image showing the distribution of the PEG polymer fragments
at m/z 45, m/z 107, and m/z 109 (blue)
and lipid headgroup fragments at m/z 184 and m/z 124.9 (green). The
scale bar is 10 μm. (C) The ion intensities for the PEG fragment
(m/z 107) and the lipid fragment
(m/z 184) were summed along the
bar orientation and plotted as a function of lateral space. The fwhm
for both the lipid (red) and PEG were measured and reported in Table
S1 (see Supporting Information).

The de facto method
for evaluating lateral resolution,
as described in the Theory section, was applied
to the SIMS image of the device. The chemical edges in the PEG linescan,
Figure 3C, were fitted to the function described
in eq 2. The Δ88–12% or fwhm of the beam, here used as an indicator of lateral resolution,
was measured for each PEG bar. These values are reported in Table
S2 (see Supporting Information, SI-5).
The average Δ88–12% was 1.45 ± 0.64 μm,
corresponding to an average σ of 0.62 ± 0.27 μm.

To demonstrate the issue with reporting fwhm, we examine the two
signals from the PC(16:0/16:0) molecule with very different signal
strengths; the protonated molecular ion of PC(16:0/16:0) at m/z 734.5 and fragment ion at m/z 184. The molecular ion peak at m/z 734 does not have enough signal-to-noise (Imax = 3.2 counts and Imin= 1.8 counts) to produce a useful image. However, when the
signal intensity for m/z 734.5 and m/z 184 across a chemical edge are plotted
in Figure 4A and fitted to eq 2, the measured Δ88–12% resolutions
were 2.28 and 2.26 μm, respectively. The de facto method did not factor in signal intensity relative to the noise
or contrast and therefore provided a lateral resolution measurement
that did not reflect the image quality.

Figure 4 (A) Intensity of the
molecular ion (m/z 734 dark green)
and fragment ion (m/z 184, light

chemical interface. Both traces were fit to the error function (solid
line). (B) The normalized ion intensity of PEG (m/z 107) plotted as a function of bar width (blue)
and the linear relationship between the expected bar width and the
measured bar width (red). (C) The MTF for PEG (m/z 107, blue) and lipid (m/z 184, green). Both traces were fit to a Gaussian function (solid
line).

The effects of sensitivity on
lateral resolution can be observed
directly with the device. The average ion intensity for PEG is plotted
as a function of bar width in Figure 4B. At
low spatial frequencies (i.e., for large bars), the chemical contrast
for PEG and the lipid are constant; however, as spatial frequency
increases and the bars get closer and closer together, the chemical
contrast for PEG decays. The extrapolated data point for zero intensity, y(0), is approximately 3.7 μm. Therefore, the narrowest
detectable bar for this particular image acquisition is 4 μm
in width. In the same plot, the linear relationship between the expected
bar width and the measured bar width is shown. The plot shows that,
even though the IMS system can resolve high spatial frequencies, the
resulting image suffers from a significant loss in contrast as the
bars get narrower (below ∼7 μm). This result demonstrates
that the lateral resolution limit of the imaging system results from
both the ability to resolve contrast and topology.

The device
was used to measure the MTF of the image. The MTF is
a commonly used method to evaluate the spatial frequency response
in a number of imaging systems, including optical microscopy techniques
and medical imaging techniques.25−27 This method has been previously
applied to SIMS imaging of inorganic material; however, it is not
routinely applied to IMS.28 The analysis
of the MTF is more informative than the mere measurements of the fwhm.29 Since contrast depends on the intensity of the
signal and noise level, parameters that affect these variables, such
as secondary ion yields, ionization efficiency, and matrix suppression
effects, influence the lateral resolution measurement. As a consequence,
the modulation of the contrast is a critical factor for the quality
of chemical imaging, as the resolution of the topology is not sufficient
to produce a good image.

The MTF for PEG (m/z 107) and
lipid (m/z 184) was plotted as a
function of spatial frequency (see Figure 4C). The MTF can be directly obtained from the intensities of the
linescans shown in Figure 3C. Both the PEG
and lipid signals reach a steady state at spatial frequency = 0.08
μm–1 (6 μm bar width); below this frequency,
the ion contrast is no longer influenced by the resolution of the
imaging system. The MTF shown in Figure 4 was
fit with Gaussians. From the trace, we can use the MTF50%, the point where the MTF has decreased to half its maximal value,
to assess lateral resolution. The corresponding frequency, f50%, is related to σ following (see Supporting Information, SI-6, Equation S-12) 6  

The computed values for σ
were 1.56 and 1.13 μm for
the lipid and PEG traces, respectively. This corresponds to fwhm of
3.67 and 2.67 μm for the lipid and PEG traces, respectively.

The fwhm and σ values obtained from the MTF are 2-times higher
than the values obtained from the de facto method
reported above. Unfortunately, the de facto methods
overestimate the resolving capabilities of the system in the case
of sensitivity-limited analytes. This result strongly advocates the
use of the MTF in place of the ESF to assess the resolution of IMS,
as the complexity of the processes resulting in the final image cannot
be solely accounted for by merely analyzing the resolution of the
sample topology. Overall, the device offers several advantages for
evaluating image resolution: the device allows the user (i) to record
simultaneously the MTF and ESF, (ii) to obtain a direct measurement
of the MTF via the test device and image contrast, and (iii) to avoid
additional processing steps (i.e., derivation and Fourier transforms)
which are more sensitive to noise levels, thus improving the reliability
of the analysis.

Characterizing MALDI Matrix Application Methods
The
device was used to characterize MALDI matrix application methods and
evaluate their effects on chemical lateral displacement. A matrix
is an essential component in MALDI imaging; it absorbs the laser radiation
and acts as a proton source during ionization. Unfortunately, the
size of the matrix crystals and the method used to apply the matrix
affect the image quality. In this experiment, MALDI matrix was sprayed
on the device and SIMS imaging was used to characterize crystal size,
as well as the incorporation and chemical displacement of the analyte
into the matrix crystals.

An ion image showing the distribution
of matrix (m/z 136, 137, 154, and
155), PEG (m/z 107 and 109), and
lipid (m/z 86, 124, and 184) is
shown in Figure 5A. The SIMS images reveal
a preferential deposition of the matrix on the PEG-functionalized
bars. It is important to note that the chemical composition of the
substrate influences the localization of matrix molecules. In order
to avoid potential artifacts in MALDI imaging experiments, it is critical
to understand the interactions between the substrate and the matrix,
as well as between the matrix and the sample. The image also shows
matrix crystals spanning across multiple bars of PEG. Such features
are mainly observed in regions where the bar width is 10 μm
and below. The ion intensities for these chemical components have
been summed along the vertical axis to form a linescan, Figure 5B. The linescan reveals the level of chemical mixing
and image blurring caused by the deposition of matrix.

Figure 5 (A) TOF-SIMS image showing
the distribution of matrix (red), PEG
(blue), and lipid (green) after solvent-based matrix application (scale
bar: 50 μm). (B) The linescan of the three components demonstrates
the mixing that occurs as a result of matrix application. (C) Ten
individual matrix crystals were isolated from the ion image in order
to emphasize the degree of chemical mixing and show the distribution
of analyte molecules in matrix crystals.

Ten crystals from the SIMS image were isolated and characterized
(see the Supporting Information, SI-7,
Table S3). The average length and width of the DHB crystals were 124.7
± 31.9 μm and 49.4 ± 20.5 μm, respectively.
The TOF-SIMS image shows the incorporation and mixing of lipid (green)
and PEG (blue) in the matrix (red). The average counts per square
micrometer and the percent coverage for various PEG, lipid, and matrix chemical
peaks were calculated for each crystal, and the average is displayed
in Table S4, in the Supporting Information. Despite the preferential nucleation of matrix crystals on the PEG
bars, lipids molecules were more mobile and readily incorporated into
the matrix crystal compared to the PEG molecules.

The distribution
of analytes in MALDI matrix crystal has previously
been measured with TOF-SIMS,30,31 MALDI,32 and confocal fluorescence microscopy;33 however, without a fixed origin, the chemical displacement
cannot be assessed. Since the device provides the known fixed origins
of the lipid and PEG before matrix was applied, the diffusion length
of PEG into the lipid domain and vice versa can be
accurately measured, as shown in Figure 6.
Details on the data processing procedures are provided in the Supporting Information, SI-8. In this case, for
a single matrix crystal spanning across the 70 μm PEG bar, the
average lipid signal was detected approximately 16 ± 15 μm
away from the interface (see Table 1). Unlike
the PEG, the lipids are not tethered to the surface of the device
and are allowed to migrate freely. The growth of the matrix crystal
on the PEG bar also displaced PEG molecules, originally localized
to the PEG region, into the lipid region. Hence, the distance between
the PEG containing pixel detected in the lipid region and the known
interface was also measured. The average PEG signal was detected 5.5
± 5 μm away from the interface. Overall, the measured displacement
of the lipids exceeded the lateral resolution measured for the device
before matrix was applied. As a result, the delocalization of the
chemical on the device can only be attributed to diffusion during
the matrix application.

Figure 6 Migration distance of PEG and lipid molecules
in a single matrix
crystal was measured using TOF-SIMS imaging and the device. TOF-SIMS
image of a single matrix crystal is isolated (top); pixels in the
PEG region that contained lipid peaks with S/N > 3 (middle, green) and pixels in the lipid region
of
the device that contained lipid peaks with S/N > 3 (middle, blue) are isolated, and the distance between
these pixels and the PEG-lipid interface is measured (bottom). The
scale bar shows 20 μm.

a Pixels with S/N > 3 of lipid were isolated, and
the distances
between these pixels and the interface were measured. Distance measurements
were collected for both the right and left sides of the crystal.

The device presented here is
therefore a potential platform for
the precise measurement of chemical displacement for various sample
preparation methods. In this case, the matrix was applied by spraying
the surface of the device with a fine mist of matrix solution. The
size of the mist droplets, the ratio of organic solvent to aqueous
solvent in the matrix solution, the concentration of the matrix, drying
time between spray cycles, and the hydrophobicity of the substrate/sample
are all operational parameters that influence the diffusion of material
and limit the potential lateral resolution of the technique.

The device can be used to evaluate the quality of MS images obtained
with MALDI. The MTF of the lipid signal obtained from the device sprayed
with matrix is plotted in Figure 7A. The f50% of the MTF plot is approximately 0.0024
μm–1. On the basis of eqs 3 and 6, the fwhm resolution is estimated
to be approximately 184 μm. The large spatial resolution is
expected on the basis of large laser step size, 50 μm, and the
mobility of the untethered lipids. The device can also be used to
evaluate differences in sample preparation. In a proof-of-concept
experiment, two different matrix application methods, a spray method
and a solvent-free sublimation method, were applied to the device
and analyzed with MALDI. The mass spectra obtained for the two sample
preparation methods reveal two distinct chemical signatures (see Figure 7B). A large PEG-related peak at m/z 1830 was observed with the spray-based method
but not within the solvent-free method. The lack of solvent in the
sublimation method most likely prevented the extraction and, therefore,
the detection of this particular PEG molecule. Overall, the proof-of-concept
experiment shows that the device is a viable platform for evaluating
MALDI imaging, as well as evaluating the effect sample preparation
has on MALDI analyses.

Conclusions
A
prototype lateral resolution test device for evaluating image
quality in IMS techniques was developed and characterized. The device
was designed for the quick assessment of the modulation transfer function
(MTF). The device, in combination with SIMS imaging, was used to measure
matrix crystal size, analyte incorporation to the matrix, and the
chemical displacement of the analyte after matrix deposition. This
flexible platform was also used to evaluate MALDI-based sample preparation
methods.
