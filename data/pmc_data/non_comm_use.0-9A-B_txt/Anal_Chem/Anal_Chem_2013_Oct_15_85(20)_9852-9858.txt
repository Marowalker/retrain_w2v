The
present study focuses on fragmented deglycosylated pyranose
dehydrogenase (fdgPDH) from Agaricus meleagris recombinantly expressed in Pichia pastoris. Fragmented deglycosylated PDH is formed from the deglycosylated
enzyme (dgPDH) when it spontaneously loses a C-terminal fragment when
stored in a buffer solution at 4 °C. The remaining larger fragment
has a molecular weight of ∼46 kDa and exhibits higher volumetric
activity for glucose oxidation compared with the deglycosylated and
glycosylated (gPDH) forms of PDH. Flow injection amperometry and cyclic
voltammetry were used to assess and compare the catalytic activity
of the three investigated forms of PDH, “wired” to graphite
electrodes with two different osmium redox polymers: [Os(4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine)2(poly(vinylimidazole))10Cl]+ [Os(dmbpy)PVI]
and [Os(4,4′-dimethoxy-2,2′-bipyridine)2(poly-(vinylimidazole))10Cl]+ [Os(dmobpy)PVI]. When “wired”
with Os(dmbpy)PVI, the graphite electrodes modified with fdgPDH showed
a pronounced increase in the current density with Jmax 13- and 6-fold higher than that observed for gPDH-
and dgPDH-modified electrodes, making the fragmented enzyme extraordinarily
attractive for further biotechnological applications. An easier access
of the substrate to the active site and improved communication between
the enzyme and mediator matrix are suggested as the two main reasons
for the excellent performance of the fdgPDH when compared with that
of gPDH and dgPDH. Three of the four glycosites in PDH: N75, N175, and N252 were assigned using mass spectrometry
in conjunction with endoglycosidase treatment and tryptic digestion.
Determination of the asparagine residues carrying carbohydrate moieties
in PDH can serve as a solid background for production of recombinant
enzyme lacking glycosylation.

==== Body
During the
past few years, much
attention has been drawn to pyranose dehydrogenase (PDH; EC 1.1.99.29),
which is a glycosylated extracellular oxidoreductase produced by a
small group of litter-degrading basidiomycete Agaricales.1 PDH carries one flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)
prosthetic group covalently bound to the polypeptide chain of the
protein. The enzyme is able to oxidize a variety of nonphosphorylated
sugars, primarily at the C-2, C-3, or C-2,3 positions, to their corresponding
aldo and diketose derivatives.1 It was
previously reported that PDH displays a slight preference for oxidation
at the C-3 over the C-2 position; however, recent studies by Tan et
al. showed that C-2 is the preferred site for oxidation.2 PDH belongs to the glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase
family but has a number of properties, which are not common for other
members of the same family. It is not able to utilize oxygen as electron
acceptor [compared, for instance, to pyranose oxidase (POx)] and has a broader substrate specificity and regioselectivity,
which can be attributed to the unique structure of the region surrounding
the C(4a) flavin pocket.2,3 Both the lack of oxygen
reactivity and the broad substrate tolerance make PDH attractive for
the fabrication of amperometric biosensors and small self-powering
devices: enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs).4

Tasca et al. reported on amperometric biosensors utilizing
PDH
isolated from the natural source (Agaricus meleagris) electrochemically “wired” with the osmium redox polymer
{[Os(4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine)2(poly(vinylimidazole)10Cl2]+)} [Os(dmbpy)PVI].5 The broad substrate
specificity, superior sensitivity, and long operational stability
of the PDH-based biosensor suggested that AmPDH is
an excellent candidate for biotechnological applications. The work
was extended by screening a number of osmium polymers with formal
potentials (E°′) ranging from below the
potential of the bound FAD of AmPDH (150 mV vs NHE6) to several hundred millivolts higher in order
to select polymer–enzyme pairs with maximized catalytic current
density.7 This approach was combined with
the concept of multiple enzymes in the construction of a glucose biofuel
cell anode reported by Tasca et al.6AmPDH was coimmobilized together with cellobiose dehydrogenase
from Myriococcum thermophilum (MtCDH) in an osmium polymer matrix in order to increase the Coulombic
efficiency of the system. The concept was based on the fact that the
reaction product of one enzyme can serve as a substrate for another. MtCDH is an ascomycete enzyme able to catalyze the oxidation
of mono-, di-, and oligosaccharides at the C(1) position to their
corresponding lactones8 and AmPDHmono- and dioxidizes, a variety of sugars at the C-2, C-3, and
C-2,3 positions.4,9,10 By
combining these two enzymes, it is therefore theoretically possible
to gain up to 6 electrons from one substrate molecule. This was shown
in recent publications by Shao et al. that the current density and
Coulombic efficiency of a bianode were further increased by entrapping
these two enzymes with different types of Os-complex matrices.11,12 Instead of using the native form of CDH consisting of one flavodomain
containing FAD (DHCDH) and one haem domain containing a b-type cytochrome (CYTCDH) connected through
a polypeptide linker region,13,14 the free and deglycosylated
DHCDH domain of CDHs from various sources were coimmobilized
with AmPDH in the Os-polymer matrix. In contrast
to native PDH, native CDHs show facile direct electron transfer with
electrodes through the CYTCDH.15,16 However, owing to the lower E°′ of
the FAD group in the free DHCDH domain compared to that
of the haem of CYTCDH domain,17 it was possible to deliver electrons to the electrode surface at
a potential close to the E°′ of the bound
FAD of DHCDH. The electron transfer was also improved due
to the smaller size and lack of glycosylation on the DHCDH domain compared to that of the native enzyme.18−21 By these means, a higher voltage
output for the respective EBFC was achieved when the free DHCDH domain was used instead of the native enzyme.

Recently, the
catalytic properties of glycosylated (gPDH) and deglycosylated
PDH (dgPDH) from A. meleagris, recombinantly
expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris,22 were investigated, and the pronounced
effect of glycan depletion of gPDH on the current output was demonstrated.23−25 The present study provides further insights into the properties
of the deglycosylated PDH, as it was discovered that dgPDH loses an
almost 20 kDa polypeptide from its C-terminus, resulting in the formation
of a fragmented deglycosylated PDH (fdgPDH) with a much higher activity
for glucose oxidation. In this contribution, the effect of the decomposition
on the catalytic properties of fdgPDH was investigated. The fragmentation
procedure was followed by gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) and
measurements of the enzyme activity [ferricenium (Fc+)].
All three forms of the enzyme were electrically “wired”
to an osmium-based redox polymer on the surface of graphite electrodes,
mounted in a flow-injection system (FIA). The current output accompanying
the glucose oxidation by the immobilized gPDH, dgPDH, and fdgPDH was
compared using FIA and cyclic voltammetry.

The proposed glycosylation
sites of PDH (NetNGlyc 1.0 Server) were
investigated using Endo H treatment in combination with tryptic digestion
followed by MALDI-MS measurements. Determination of the asparagine
residues carrying the carbohydrate moieties opens up an interesting
possibility for further improvement of the performance of the enzyme.
Through the use of site-directed mutagenesis, it is possible to eliminate
those asparagine residues, to which the glycans are attached and recombinantly
express an enzyme with an altered glycosylation pattern.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Chemie GmbH (Steinheim, Germany) unless stated otherwise and were
of analytical grade. Glycosylated PDH (EC 1.1.99.29; sequence UniProt: Q3L245;26 protein content 23.8 mg mL–1 [Bradford assay]; volumetric activity 335 units mL–1 [Fc+ assay, 20 °C]) from A. meleagris was recombinantly expressed in P. pastoris according to the previously reported procedure.22 Deglycosylation was performed with Endo Hf (1000000 NEB
units mL–1, New England Biolabs, Bionordiska AB,
Stockholm, Sweden) as described in the Supporting
Information. A stock solution of d-glucose (40 mM)
was prepared in the running buffer and stored overnight to reach mutarotational
equilibrium. The osmium redox polymers [Os(dmobpy)PVI] E°′ = 140 mV vs NHE and [Os(dmobpy)PVI] E°′ = 320 mV vs NHE) were synthesized, according to a
well-established procedure.27,28 Dithiothretiol (DTT),
iodoacetic acid (IAA), and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) were obtained
from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Deionized water was used throughout
all experiments. It was purified with a Milli-Q purification system
(EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA).

Enzyme Assay
The
enzyme activity toward Fc+ was measured with a UV-2401
PC spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Deutschland
GmbH, Duisburg, Germany) at 20 °C, using a standard spectrophotometric
method29 (Supporting
Information).

Electrode Preparation
Graphite rods
(Ringsdorff Werke
GmbH, Bonn, Germany, type RW001, 3.05 mm diameter and 13% porosity)
were polished on wet fine emery paper (grit number P1200), rinsed
thoroughly with deionized water, and dried under a flow of air. The
electrode surface was first incubated for 10 min with a mixture of
2 μL of Os-polymer (5 mg mL–1 aqueous solution)
and 1 μL of poly(ethylene glycol)(400) diglycidyl ether (PEGDGE,
68%, v/v) to which 5 μL of enzyme was added. An enzyme to Os-polymer
mass ratio of 4:1 was used throughout all experiments. Cross-linking
was allowed to proceed overnight at 4 °C in a humid atmosphere.
Finally, the rods were rinsed with the running buffer and mounted
into the FIA system.

Electrochemical Measurements
A wall-jet
type flow-through
electrochemical cell30,31 was used for the characterization
of the three different PDHs (gPDG, dgPDH, and fdgPDH). Graphite rods
modified with the covalently bound enzyme–polymer complex were
used as working electrodes, with Ag|AgCl (0.1 M KCl, 288 mV vs NHE)
as the reference electrode and the platinum wire as the counter electrode.
All three electrodes were connected to a three-electrode potentiostat
(Zäta Electronics, Höör, Sweden) controlling
the applied potential of the working electrode (468 mV vs NHE). The
current output was registered with a recorder (BD 112, Kipp &
Zonen, Utrecht, The Netherlands). The electrochemical cell was connected
to a FIA system32 equipped with a peristaltic
pump (Minipuls 3, Gilson, Villier-le Bel, France) and a six-port injection
valve (Rheodyne, type 7125 LabPR, Cotati, CA) for introduction of
50 μL samples. All concentrations in the injected samples were
corrected for the dispersion factor of the FIA system, which was determined
to be 1.088. Sodium phosphate (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing 137 mM NaCl
served as the running buffer, which was degassed prior to the measurements
in order to avoid bubble formation in the system. The running buffer
was pumped through the system at a constant flow rate of 0.5 mL min–1. The kinetic parameters were calculated by fitting
the data using the Michaelis–Menten equation in the OriginPro
8 program.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a BAS
CV-50W potentiostat (Bioanalytical Systems, West Lafayette, IN) with
the enzyme–polymer complex modified graphite rods used as the
working electrode, a saturated calomel reference electrode (244 mV
vs NHE), and a platinum foil counter electrode. Nitrogen was purged
through the solutions prior to measurements for 15 min and over the
solutions during the measurements in order to maintain an inert atmosphere.
Cyclic voltammograms were recorded in a 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer
containing 137 mM NaCl (pH 7.4) at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1.

Gel Electrophoresis
Fragmentation of the deglycosylated
enzyme was followed in time with one-dimensional SDS–PAGE,
using a Bio-Rad system (Sundbyberg, Sweden) following the method of
Laemmli.33 Gels containing 10% acrylamide
were used to resolve the proteins at a constant applied potential
of 200 V. Subsequently, proteins were visualized on the gel with silver
staining as described in refs (34 and 35). More detailed information can be found in the Supporting Information.

Trypsin Digestion
Prior to trypsin digestion, the disulfide
bonds in the protein sample were reduced with DTT and blocked with
IAA, according to a modified procedure described in ref (36) (Supporting
Information).

MALDI-MS Measurements
The enzymatic
digests (0.5 μL)
were spotted onto the MALDI target in triplicate and an equal volume
of a MALDI matrix solution consisting of 5 mg mL–1 α-cyano-4-cinnamic acid (α-CHCA) in 50% acetonitrile
and 0.1% (v/v) phosphoric acid was added.37 The matrix solution contained two peptide standards: des-Arg-bradykinin
(m/z 904.468) and adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH) peptide fragment 18-39 (m/z 2465.199) that was used for internal mass calibration
in every analyte/matrix position. MALDI-MS and MS/MS analyses of each
sample were performed on a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI-TOF/TOF
mass spectrometer in the positive reflection mode (Applied Biosystems,
Framingham, MA).

Dilutions of the digests were made at 1:5 and
1:10 fold with a mixture of 2% acetonitrile and 1% formic acid in
deionized water and were spotted on the plate in the same manner.
Uniprot database using Mascot (Matrix Sciences Ltd., Cheshire, U.K.)
was used with the following parameters: carbamidomethylation of all
cysteins, possible oxidation of methionine residues, three allowed
trypsin misscleavages, and a mass tolerance of 30 ppm and 0.02 Da
for MS and MS/MS search, respectively. Using the features of the GPMAW
8.1 software, sequence coverage for digested dgPDH and gPDH were compared
with a S/N threshold of 15.

Results and Discussion
Gel Electrophoresis
Study of dgPDH Fragmentation
The
present study focuses on the discovered fdgPDH: a fragmented form
of the enzyme, which is formed from dgPDH when stored under certain
conditions. In order to follow the fragmentation process, a portion
of freshly purified and enzymatically deglycosylated dgPDH was stored
at 4 °C instead of at −30 °C, at which the enzyme
was shown to be stable.22 All three forms
of PDH (gPDH, dgPDH, and fdgPDH) were investigated using SDS–PAGE
stained with silver.35 The molecular weight
of gPDH recombinantly expressed in P. pastoris was determined to be roughly ∼95–100 kDa (Figure 1, panels a and b), similar to previous reports by
Sygmund et al.22 It appeared in a broad
band due to possible structural variations in the glycan moieties38 but remained unchanged over a period of 3 months
when stored at 4 °C (Figure 1, panels
a and b).

Deglycosylation of gPDH was accomplished by incubation
with Endo Hf as described in the Supporting Information. Purified dgPDH appeared in two bands on SDS–PAGE (Figure 1, panels a and b). A major band at ∼65 Da
corresponds to a release of ∼30–35 kDa of the glycan
moiety from the peptide chain. The other minor band at ∼46
kDa presumably is partially fragmented dgPDH, which is formed when
the enzyme is stored at 4 °C. It appears due to the loss of a
peptide of ∼20 kDa from the C-terminus of the protein, even
in the absence of any proteolytic activity. The first observation
of this effect was discovered by Sygmund et al. and was briefly described
in ref (1). The smaller
fragment was sequenced by Edman degradation and found to start with
the sequence YRLLLQL, so cleavage must occur between amino acids 441
and 442 (number one being the Met from the start codon). This sequence
does not conform to any known peptidase consensus site.

A gradual
fragmentation of dgPDH can be seen in Figure 1 (panels a and b). dgPDH was initially represented
by two bands at ∼65 Da (dgPDH) and ∼46 Da (fdgPDH).
Changes in band intensity and thickness indicate that fragmentation
progressed with time. After about two months, the upper band faded
completely, and the lower band became the only one that could be clearly
observed on the gel (Figure 1b). It corresponds
to the fully fragmented product (fdgPDH). In terms of potential technological
applications of PDH in biosensor development and EBFCs fabrication
it was particularly important to study the effect of fragmentation
on the activity of fdgPDH, as well as the current output in amperometric
measurements when entrapped within an Os polymer matrix.

Figure 1 Characterization
of enzyme fragmentation with time by 10% acrylamide
SDS–PAGE with silver staining: lane 1, molecular weight standard;
lanes 2 and 3, gPDH; lanes 4 and 5, dgPDH; lanes 6 and 7, fdgPDH.
The difference between lanes 2 and 3, 4 and 5, and 6 and 7 can be
observed after storing the enzymes for two weeks (a) at 4 °C:
gPDH and fdgDPH and at −20 °C: dgPDH and for two months
(b) at 4 °C: gPDH and fdgDPH and at −20 °C: dgPDH.

Spectrophotometric Activity
Assay
The volumetric activity
of fdgPDH was measured regularly for three months with ferrocenium
ion as an electron acceptor and glucose as a substrate. The activity
of the enzyme was gradually increasing, reaching a plateau after about
two months (Figure 2). It can therefore be
concluded that the loss of the C-terminal fragment does not play an
important role in the activity of the whole enzyme. The remaining
large part of dgPDH (fdgPDH) has an even higher specific activity
due to the smaller molecular weight of the fragmented product.

Figure 2 Change in activity
of the solution originally containing freshly
made dgPDH with time as a result of fragmentation of the enzyme. The
volumetric activity was measured using glucose as a substrate and
ferrocenium (Fc+) as an electron acceptor (see the Experimental Section).

Electrocatalytic Properties of Glycosylated, Deglycosylated,
and Fragmented Deglycosylated PDH
In accordance with the
Marcus theory, the rate of electron transfer between two species participating
in a redox reaction decreases when the distance between them increases.39 In the case of redox enzymes, it is thus possible
to improve the electron transfer rate with an electrode by bringing
the redox active site closer to the electrode surface. This can be
practically accomplished by complete or partial removal of the glycan
shell surrounding the protein peptide chain of glycosylated redox
enzymes. Previous successful applications of this approach were demonstrated
either by deglycosylation of redox enzymes40−42 or by recombinant
expression of enzymes in a prokaryotic host.19−21,23−25,43 The electron transfer mechanism between fdgPDH and the Os-polymer
matrix should also be improved compared to that of dgPDH and gPDH.
The fragmented enzyme loses a part of its C-terminal sequence, which
should make the distance between the active site and the mediator
shorter. An additional increase in current output can be expected
if the C-terminal fragment in dgPDH possibly interferes with the diffusion
of the substrate into the active center of the enzyme. To investigate
these matters, the electrochemical behavior of fdgPDH was measured
using CV and amperometry in a FIA system, where the enzyme was coimmobilized
with an Os-polymer using a diepoxy cross-linker (PEGDGE) and coprecipitated
on the surface of a graphite working electrode in the same manner
as described in refs (23−25). The catalytic
properties of fdgPDH were compared to those obtained for gPDH and
dgPDH in terms of current output.

Figure 3 depicts the current density response to glucose concentrations in
the range of 0.1–20 mM of electrodes modified separately with
the three forms of the enzyme (gPDH, dgPDH, fdgPDH) cross-linked with
Os(dmbpy)PVI. The applied potential of 468 mV versus NHE was selected
from the polarization curves, where the current density reaches a
plateau for all three enzyme-Os-polymer-modified electrodes (Figure
S-1 of the Supporting Information). The
same working potential was selected for electrochemical characterization
of the fdgPDH/Os(dmobpy)PVI-modified electrodes (Figure S-2 of the Supporting Information). A pronounced increase
in current density is observed in the case of electrodes modified
with fdgPDH/Os(dmbpy)PVI. When fitted to the Michaelis–Menten
equation, Jmax for fdgPDH is 13- and 6-fold
higher than that for gPDH and dgPDH, respectively. The estimated apparent
KMapp is smaller
for both dgPDH (1.7 mM) and fdgPDH (2.8 mM) compared to gPDH (5.1
mM), indicating that the substrate diffusion into the active site
of the deglycosylated and fragmented forms of PDH is easier. Similar
results were achieved when studying the catalytic properties of gPDH,
dgPDH, and fdgPDH, with CV under conditions described in the Experimental Section and with 10 mM glucose as substrate
(Figure S-3 in the Supporting Information). It is clear from the graphic output that the maximum of the anodic
wave increases with a decrease in the molecular weight of the enzyme.
Both the increase in current output for fdgPDH and the decrease in
KMapp support
the theory that the spontaneous cleavage of the C-terminal fragment
plays an important role in the catalytic performance of the remaining
part of the fragmented enzyme. However, it is not clear if the improvement
arises due to sterical reasons or to a faster electron communication
between the redox active site and the Os-matrix. A contribution from
both factors is possible.

When comparing the catalytic response
of electrodes modified with
fdgPDH coimmobilized with various PVI-bound Os complexes to different
concentrations of glucose in the FIA system, higher current densities
were obtained when using the Os(dmbpy)PVI polymer as a mediator (Figure 4). The potential difference of the fdgPDH/Os(dmbpy)PVI
pair is larger than that of the fdgPDH/Os(dmobpy)PVI pair. Therefore,
the driving force for electron transfer is higher, and greater current
densities could be obtained when the same applied potential of 468
mV versus NHE is used. Both of the Os-bound imidazole complexes should
be considered for fabrication of bioanodes in combination with fdgPDH
as a larger open circuit potential is obtained with Os(dmobpy)PVI
having a lower formal potential, but higher current densities are
obtained with the Os(dmbpy)PVI-based polymer.

The stability
of fdgPDH “wired” with Os(dmbpy)PVI
and Os(dmobpy)PVI was examined using the FIA system by reiterative
injections of 5 mM glucose under those conditions specified in Figure 4 (Figure S-4 of the Supporting
Information). A signal decrease of only 9% and 11% was observed
for the fdgPDH/Os(dmbpy)PVI- and the fdgPDH/Os(dmobpy)PVI-modified
electrodes, respectively, after 8 h of continuous operation. After
54 h, the electrodes retained 60% and 33% of their respective initial
catalytic responses.

graphite electrodes to different concentrations of glucose (0.1–20

of 0.5 mL min–1 and an applied potential of 468
mV vs NHE.

min–1 and an applied potential of 468 mV vs NHE.

An attempt to produce a smaller
PDH by expression without the C-terminal
fragment has been made since the smaller size of the protein would
allow more molecules to be incorporated into the polymer matrix without
having to wait for spontaneously occurring fragmentation. Unfortunately,
these attempts were unsuccessful and resulted only in an inactive
enzyme (data not shown).

Analysis of Glycosites Using MALDI-MS
The improved
electrocatalytic performance of fdgPDH makes that enzyme attractive
for future biotechnological application. However, at present, the
production of fragmented enzyme is time-consuming and requires enzymatic
deglycosylation. Recombinant expression of the enzyme lacking (part
of the) glycosylation in P. pastoris might be beneficial for such applications if the enzyme will retain
its stability. This can be performed with site-directed mutagenesis,
provided that the locations of the glycosites in the polypeptide chain
are known.

Glycosylation site mapping using MALDI-MS in combination
with site-specific endoglycosidase treatment was performed in order
to unequivocally identify the glycosylation sites of AmPDH. In the first step, four possible glycosylation sites in the
primary structure of AmPDH were located: N75, N175, N252, and N319 based on
the fact that carbohydrate moieties may only be attached to Asn in
a tripeptide consensus sequon Asn-X-Ser/Thr/Cys (where X can be any
amino acid except proline44). The carbohydrate
chains were then removed from gPDH with Endo H, an endoglycosidase,
which cleaves within the chitobiose core of high mannose and some
hybrid oligosaccharides from N-linked glycoproteins. Endo H hydrolyses
the O-glycosidic bond between two N-acetylglucosamine residues (GlcNAc) attached to Asn in the polypeptide
chain and the retained GlcNAc with a mass increase of 203.079 Da can
therefore serve as a clear indication for glycosylation in the MS
spectra (Figure 5).45−47 In the following
step, both gPDH and dgPDH were subjected to treatment with a protease
(trypsin) and samples were analyzed with MALDI-MS. Finally, mass spectra
of digested gPDH and dgPDH were compared using a peptide mass fingerprint
(PMF) strategy.48−50

The PMF analysis gave a sequence coverage
of 50% for the investigated
glycosylated protein with 31 peptide hits and 50% for the deglycosylated
protein with 28 peptides detected when using GPMAW 8.1. None of the
peptides potentially carrying glycan moieties were covered when analyzing
the mass list from both gPDH and dgPDH using GPMAW 8.1, which served
as a preliminary indication that the Asn residues N75,
N175, N252, and N319 can be glycosylated.

Conformation of the glycosylation was performed by comparing the
MALDI MS spectra for the control sample with the MALDI spectra of
the deglycosylated-treated sample (Figure 5, panels a and b). The presence of a m/z peak with a mass of a suspected glycosylated peptide +203.079 Da
clearly suggested that the peptide was glycosylated before treatment
with Endo H (Figure 5b). The final confirmation
was made when the suspected glycosylated peptide was submitted to
MS/MS experiment with the following manual assignment of the fragmented
ions (Figure 5c). Figure 5 illustrates the stepwise assignment of the N252 residue.

Three of four peptides carrying the N75, N175, and N252 residues with an increased mass of 203.079
Da were found in the mass spectra of dgPDH. Subsequent MS/MS analysis
and sequencing of these precursor fragment ions indicated that the
positions N75, N175, and N252 in AmPDH are indeed glycosylated. For the remaining residue
N319, no experimental data could be obtained either in
the glycosylated peptide or in the nonmodified version, possibly due
to the fact that the signal arising in MS for the corresponding peptide
mass ion is suppressed by other, more abundant mass ions. Another
mass spectrometric instrumentation was tried out in order to find
the peptide sequence containing residue N319. An Orbitrap-Velos
Pro System was used and a data-dependent scan with an inclusion list
of the peptide carrying N319 was performed. However, no
MS/MS spectra could confirm the presence or absence of glycosylation
on this Asn residue. This indicates that the Endo H protocol did not
work 100% efficiently for the peptide carrying the N319 residue or that this peptide had some post-translational modification
that made it impossible to identify it. As expected, none of the precursor
fragment ions were found in the gPDH sample (Figure 5a).

match the protein sequence resulting in a sequence coverage of 50%.
(c) MS/MS spectrum of the peptide VLSASGNGTDFR from AmPDH deglycosylated with Endo H (the precursor fragment
ion with m/z 1246.69 is denoted
with a star). Y-ion series denoted in the figure, where the asparagine
residue N252 carries the carbohydrate moiety (denoted with
“G”).

Conclusions
The
discovered fdgPDH was characterized using SDS–PAGE with
silver staining and a standard spectrophotometric assay. fdgPDH is
formed from dgPDH, which loses a C-terminal fragment when stored for
two months at 4 °C. The fragmented enzyme has a MW of ∼46
kDa and possesses a higher specific activity compared to the glycosylated
and the deglycosylated forms of the same enzyme. The electrocatalytical
properties of fdgPDH were compared to those of dgPDH and gPDH when
coimmobilized with Os(dmbpy)PVI on the surface of the graphite electrode.
Noticeably higher current densities were achieved for the fragmented
enzyme in both FIA amperometry and cyclic voltammetry. A higher catalytic
response was observed when “wiring” fdgPDH with the
Os(dmbpy)PVI-based polymer compared to fdgPDH/Os(dmobpy)PVI-modified
electrodes. Films prepared by coimmobilization of fdgPDH with the
Os-polymer having a higher formal potential also exhibited a better
operational and long-term stability. Glycosylation site mapping was
performed using MALDI-MS in combination with endoglycosidase treatment
and subsequent tryptic digestion. Three asparagine residues carrying
carbohydrate moieties, N75, N175, N252, were assigned in PMF analysis. The obtained information can serve
as a starting point in recombinant production of mutant AmPDH lacking glycosylation.
