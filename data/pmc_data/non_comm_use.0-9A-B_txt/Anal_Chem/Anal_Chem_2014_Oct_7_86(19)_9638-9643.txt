Target DNA fragments at 10 fM concentration
(approximately 6 ×
105 molecules) were detected against a DNA background simulating
the noncomplementary genomic DNA present in real samples using a simple,
PCR-free, optics-free approach based on electromechanical signal transduction.
The development of a rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective nucleic
acid detection platform is highly desired for a range of diverse applications.
We previously described a potentially low-cost device for sequence-specific
nucleic acid detection based on conductance change measurement of
a pore blocked by electrophoretically mobilized bead-(peptide nucleic
acid probe) conjugates upon hybridization with target nucleic acid.
Here, we demonstrate the operation of our device with longer DNA targets,
and we describe the resulting improvement in the limit of detection
(LOD). We investigated the detection of DNA oligomers of 110, 235,
419, and 1613 nucleotides at 1 pM to 1 fM and found that the LOD decreased
as DNA length increased, with 419 and 1613 nucleotide oligomers detectable
down to 10 fM. In addition, no false positive responses were obtained
with noncomplementary, control DNA fragments of similar length. The
1613-base DNA oligomer is similar in size to 16S rRNA, which suggests
that our device may be useful for detection of pathogenic bacteria
at clinically relevant concentrations based on recognition of species-specific
16S rRNA sequences.

==== Body
Ultrasensitive,
rapid, and cost-effective
sequence-specific detection of nucleic acids (NAs) is of great significance
for pathogen detection,1 medical diagnostics,2 drug discovery,3 and
forensic investigations.4 Many strategies
and technologies with high sensitivity and specificity have been developed
for NA detection using optical,5 mechanical,6 and electrochemical signal transduction.7 For instance, an electrochemical strategy with
dual amplification by polymerase reaction and hybridization chain
reaction (HCR) enabled an 8 fM concentration limit of detection (LOD)8 of target NA. In a study by Zeng and co-workers,
a lateral flow biosensor based on isothermal strand-displacement polymerase
reaction and gold nanoparticles was designed for visual detection
of NAs with a LOD of 0.01 fM.9 The same
group developed a hairpin DNA probe and gold nanoparticle assay for
multiplex DNA detection with a 0.1 fM LOD.10 In another approach, an electrochemiluminescence DNA sensor combined
with isothermal circular amplification exhibited a 5 aM detection
limit.11 A sensor based on a conducting
nanowire with a LOD of 0.1 fM was fabricated for detection of a 19
bp breast cancer gene by the Mulchandani group.12 Giri et al. adapted a quantum dot (QD) barcode platform
to detect infectious agents with a 10 fM concentration limit.13 Also, magnetic particle-mediated aggregation
combined with rolling circle amplification was used to detect specific
NAs with a 124 fM detection limit.14 In
another approach, a PCR based magnetic assembled sensor was developed
for DNA detection at 4.26 aM.15 However,
the majority of these technologies rely on sample amplification using
PCR, HCR, or rolling circle amplification to reach low detection limits
and require expensive instrumentation and/or labels other than a complementary
oligonucleotide probe. Therefore, the need remains for development
of technologies for fast, sensitive, and cost-effective detection
of specific NAs.

We previously demonstrated a binary-mode, label-free,
optics-free,
potentially low-cost sequence-specific NA detection device with a
detection limit of 10 pM.16 For many applications,
a binary-mode device that provides a rapid, accurate yes/no response
regarding the presence/absence of a specific NA sequence can address
the question of primary concern. For example: Is the mutation present?
Does the sample contain NA identifying an individual? Is a pathogenic
species present in a sample beyond some threshold concentration? It
is important to note that questions regarding threshold concentrations
can be addressed through sample processing given a limit of detection
for the binary-mode device. Our system utilizes polystyrene beads
conjugated with peptide nucleic acid (PNA) oligonucleotide probes.
In PNA, the negatively charged phosphodiester backbone of DNA/RNA
is replaced with repetitive uncharged units of N-(2-aminoethyl)
glycine to which the bases are attached with a methyl carbonyl linker,
thus enabling the construction of charge-neutral probe–bead
conjugates.17 Introduction of complementary
20-mer target DNA to these neutrally charged PNA–bead conjugates
resulted in sequence-specific binding of single-stranded DNA to the
PNA, imparting negative charge to the assembly thereby making it electrophoretically
mobile. Following placement of these bead conjugates with hybridized
target in a conical capillary with tip diameter smaller than the bead
diameter, the beads were electrophoretically driven toward the capillary
tip, blocking it and producing a large, easily measurable, and persistent
change in electrical current (Figure 1).

Figure 1 (a) In an applied
electric field (+ and – symbols), charge
neutral PNA–beads in a conical capillary are electrophoretically
immobile in the presence of noncomplementary NA, which passes through
the capillary pore without significantly altering the measured current.
(b) Complementary NA binds to the PNA–bead, making the complex
negatively charged and electrophoretically mobile, thereby resulting
in the NA–PNA–bead blocking the capillary, which results
in a large and persistent reduction in conductance.

In the work described here, we explored the ability
of our device
to detect longer DNA fragments. Because our detection concept is dependent
upon charge imparted to the PNA–beads by the bound target NA,
we hypothesized that the increased charge added to the bead conjugate
per target DNA molecule would result in a reduced limit of detection.

PROCEDURE
Materials
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise noted. Carboxylic acid-functionalized,
3 μm diameter polystyrene microspheres were purchased from Polysciences,
Inc. (Warrington, PA). Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) was purchased from
Bio-Synthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX) as high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC)-purified and lyophilized powders. The PNA capture probe used
was NH2-(CH2CH2O)12-GC
AA CA GT CT TC. Methoxypolyethylene glycol amine, CH3O-(CH2CH2O)3-NH2, MW 350, was obtained
from Nanocs, Inc. (New York, NY). Prepulled borosilicate micropipettes
with a 2 μm inside tip diameter were bought from World Precision
Instruments, Inc. (Sarasota, FL). NovaBlue competent Escherichia coli K-12 cells and pET-21b (+) plasmid
vector were purchased from EMD Millipore, Inc. (Billerica, MA). Restriction
endonucleases ScaI, PvuI, PstI, BsaI, and EcoNI were obtained from
New England BioLabs, Inc. (Ipswich, MA). Finally, QIAprep Spin Miniprep,
QIAquickGel Extraction, and MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kits were purchased
from QIAGEN (Valencia, CA).

Probe Coupling to Microspheres
50
μL of 3 μm
diameter, carboxylic acid-functionalized polystyrene microspheres
at 1.69 × 109/mL were washed three times with MES
buffer (60 mM 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid,
pH 5.5). The diameter (determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS))
and ζ-potential (see below) of the beads before conjugation
was measured with a Zetasizer Nano-ZS (Malvern Instruments) and found
to be 3716 nm and −87 mV, respectively. After each wash, the
microspheres were centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 15 min; after the third
wash, the beads were resuspended in 0.6 mL of coupling buffer (100
mM 1-[3-(dimethylamine)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) in MES buffer)
and incubated at 50 °C for 45 min. 10 nM amine-functionalized
PNA probes was added to the coupling buffer and incubated with the
beads at 50 °C for 2 h. mPEG-amine (100 mM) was added to the
reaction mixture and incubated at 50 °C for 1 h to reduce nonspecific
binding of nucleic acids to the beads. 100 mM ethanolamine was added
to the beads to cap residual carboxyl groups and incubated at 50 °C
for an additional hour. Finally, the beads were washed four times
in 0.4× SSC buffer (60 mM NaCl, 6 mM trisodium citrate, 0.1%
Triton X-100, pH 8) and stored in PBS buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM
KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) at 4 °C. Prior to hybridization, the zeta potentials
of PNA–bead batches were measured in 1 mM KCl, 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES, pH 7.0) to ensure the near electroneutrality of the beads.
The ζ-potential after four washes typically was ∼−2.4
mV. At this low potential, the beads tended to aggregate, which prevented
meaningful diameter measurement by DLS.

Sample Preparation
Plasmid
Preparation
Competent E. coli K-12 bacteria (NovaBlue) were transformed with the pET-21b(+) vector
following the Novagen protocol. NovaBlue cells were removed from freezer
and thawed on ice for 2–5 min. 20 μL cell aliquots were
placed in prechilled polypropylene tubes to which 1 μL of purified
plasmid DNA was added and incubated on ice for 5 min. Then the tubes
were heated for 30 s in a 42 °C water bath and placed on ice
for 2 min. 80 μL of room temperature SOC medium (2% tryptone,
0.5% yeast extract, 10 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MgSO4, and 20 mM glucose) was added to each tube.
An agar plate containing Luria Broth (LB) (10 g/L tryptone, 10 g/L
NaCl, and 5 g/L yeast extract in DI water, pH 7.5) was coated with
60 μL SOC medium and 100 mg/L ampicillin. 25 μL of the
induced cells was spread over this plate and incubated inverted at
37 °C for 15 h. After incubation, a single colony of plasmid-induced
NovaBlue cells was selected from the agar plate and incubated in 10
mL LB media supplemented with 100 mg/L ampicillin at 37 °C for
8 h to provide a starter culture. Subsequently, 1 mL of starter culture
was diluted into 500 mL of LB medium and the solution was incubated
at 37 °C for 14 h. The bacterial culture was aliquoted into 10
50 mL Falcon tubes and centrifuged at 25000g for
15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and the pellets were
stored at −80 °C.

For plasmid extraction, one bacterial
pellet was thawed in a 50 °C DI water bath. Plasmid extraction
and purification was performed following the QIAprep Spin Miniprep
Kit protocol. The concentration of extracted plasmids was measured
using a NanoDrop2000 (ThermoScientific) spectrophotometer at 260 nm
wavelength.

Plasmid Digestion and DNA Isolation and Purification
The isolated plasmid was double digested by selected restriction
enzyme pairs from ScaI, PvuI, PstI, BsaI, and EcoNI (Figure 2a). The enzyme pairs were selected such that target
fragments of different lengths were produced containing the sequence,
3′-GA AG AC TG TT GC-5′; and control fragments of different
lengths were produced not containing the target sequence. Specifically,
ScaI and PvuI, acting at bases 4537 and 4427 on the plasmid respectively,
produced a 110-base, target-containing fragment, T1 (Figure 2), with the remainder of the plasmid forming a 5332-base,
non-target-containing fragment. Similarly, ScaI (4537) and PstI (4302)
produced target fragment T2 (235 bases); while ScaI (4537) and BsaI
(4118) produced target fragment T3 (419 bases), and PvuI (4427) and
EcoNI (598) produced target fragment T4 (1613 bases). Control fragments
not containing the target sequence were produced using PvuI and PstI
(C1, 125 bases), PstI and BsaI (C2, 184 bases), PvuI and BsaI (C3,
309 bases), and ScaI and EcoNI (C4, 1503 bases).

Figure 2 Schematic of DNA oligomer
preparation. (a) Purified pET-21b plasmids
were enzymatically digested by selected pairs of ScaI, PvuI, PstI, BsaI, and EcoNI restriction enzymes, producing fragments
of different lengths. The target DNA sequence complementary to the
PNA probe is located beginning at plasmid position 4427 (orange band).
Plasmid digestion by ScaI and PvuI produced a 110-base, target-containing
fragment, T1. Plasmid digestion by PvuI and PstI produced a 125-base,
target-free control fragment, C1. Other fragments were produced similarly:
T2 (235 bases) using ScaI and PstI, T3 (419 bases) using ScaI and
BsaI, T4 (1613 bases) using by PvuI and EcoNI), C2 (184 bases) using
PstI and BsaI, C3 (309 bases) using PvuI and BsaI, and C4 (1503 bases)
using ScaI and EcoNI. (b) Following digestion, the DNA was isolated
by gel electrophoresis, extracted, and purified. (c) Purified double-stranded
DNA was denatured and hybridized with bead–PNA probe conjugates.
(d) DNA–PNA–bead mixture was injected into the micropipette
for electrical detection.

After plasmid digestion, target and control DNA fragments
were
isolated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, were excised from the
gel, and were purified using QIAquick gel extraction and MinElute
cleanup kits (Figure 2b) and eluted into 10
μL of buffer EB (10 mM Tris–Cl, pH 8.5). The DNA concentration
of the fragment preparations was measured using the NanoDrop spectrophotometer
(260 nm wavelength) prior to hybridization experiments with bead conjugates.

Hybridization
Double-stranded DNA samples were denatured
into single strands in a 90 °C water bath for 20 min. Prior to
hybridization, 2.1 × 106 PNA–beads were washed
twice with 0.4× SSC buffer and once with hybridization buffer
(750 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.0). DNA samples and PNA–beads
were resuspended in hybridization buffer and incubated at 37 °C
overnight (Figure 2c). Target and control DNA
of each strand length was hybridized with PNA–beads in a 100
μL reaction volume at different concentrations, following a
serial dilution scheme.

ζ-Potential and Electrical Measurements
The ζ-potential
and electrical measurements were performed as previously described.16 Following incubation with single-stranded target
and/or control DNA, PNA–beads were injected into the micropipette
and drawn toward the pore (i.e., pipette tip) under 25 V applied potential
difference (Figure 2d). The apparatus containing
the capillary and electrodes was mounted on the stage of a Leica DMIRB
inverted microscope for simultaneous microscopic observation. ζ-Potentials
and measured currents for each experiment are listed in the Supporting Information. With the exception of
the runs at 10 fM, one capillary was used for each DNA concentration
at each size of target or controlled DNA, and three capillaries were
employed for the runs at 10 fM. Thus, a total of 48 capillaries were
used to obtain the data described below (see the Supporting Information). In addition, control runs were performed
in which PNA–beads not exposed to DNA and DNA alone were added
to the capillaries.

Results and Discussion
Previously, we used our platform for sequence specific detection
of 20-mer DNA containing a portion of the anthrax LF gene with a demonstrated
detection limit of 10 pM.16 Many samples
of biological origin prepared by shearing or other methods contain
DNA of 1000 bases or more.18−20 Additionally, as our method relies
on the electrophoretic blockade of a pipette tip by beads that have
acquired their electrophoretic mobility through the binding of negatively
charged target DNA, use of longer DNA strands would impart more negative
charge per bound DNA molecule. Notably, 16S rRNA, commonly used to
identify the presence of specific microbial species in a sample, measures
∼1500 bases, which is of similar length to our largest target
DNA, T4 (1613 bases). We hypothesized that increasing the length of
the target DNA would enable detection at lower DNA concentrations.

To assess the capability of our system to detect DNA of various
longer lengths and to investigate the impact of target DNA length
on the concentration LOD, we produced DNA of 110, 235, 419, and 1613
nucleotides in length all containing the same 12 base target sequence.
Control studies were performed with DNA of similar lengths (125, 184,
309, and 1503 nucleotides) in which the target sequence was not present.
For efficient production of target and control DNA21 we performed controlled restriction enzyme digests of pET21b(+)
plasmid DNA produced by a bacterial expression system. The 12-mer
target sequence complementary to our PNA probe was located at the
5′- end of the 110-mer and 1613-mer target strands, but was
in the middle of the 235-mer and 419-mer targets (Figure 2a).

Figure 3 (a) Sample current trace measured with an unblocked capillary
tip
(pore) at −25 V. (b) Sample data showing five bead blockages
(numbered) of at least 60 s and four intermittent, brief field reversals
(+25 V) to remove beads from the pore (gray bars). The measured current
exhibits a large step reduction (to a less negative value) when a
bead immobilizes at the capillary tip. (c) Sample transient block
of the pore showing brief current reduction and return to its preblock
level under constant applied voltage of −25 V.

Following digestion, gel electrophoresis, excision,
purification,
and characterization, each of the target and control DNA samples were
separately diluted to 1 pM, 100 fM, 10 fM, and 1 fM. The DNA in each
of these solutions was denatured and hybridized with the PNA–beads.
Beads incubated with each target and control concentration (1 pM–10
fM) were injected into a fresh capillary and the resultant current
measured during voltage application (Figure 3). The open pore currents consistently ranged from 500 to 700 nA
due to variations in capillary diameters (see the Supporting Information).16 When
a block was observed, the potential was maintained for at least 60
s following the block. Blocks that persisted for ≥60 s were
deemed to be permanent. Blocked currents were 10 to 30% less than
open pore currents due to variations both in capillary and bead diameters
(see the Supporting Information).16 To show that permanent blocks were a result
of electrophoresis and not an adhesion of the bead to the capillary
wall, we repeatedly reversed the voltage and reapplied it to open
the pore and obtain another block (Figure 3b). Some bead blocks were observed to be transient, where the bead
traveled back down the capillary after a short time (average time
of 10.8 s) (Figure 3c). This was also observed
in our previous work, where we hypothesized that removal of weakly
attached, nonspecifically bound DNA from the bead reduced its charge,
reducing the electrophoretic force on the bead and enabling its removal
from the tip by the opposing electroosmotic16 flow.

The measured currents and ζ-potentials for beads
incubated
with DNA oligomers at each concentration are listed in the Supporting Information. Interestingly, the measured
ζ-potentials did not consistently correlate with length of bound
DNA or its concentration, although it appears that a ζ-potential
of at least −35 to −40 mV is required for a preparation
to give a permanent block. This inconsistent correlation could be
due to the heterogeneity of the population, the conformation of bound
DNA, and the existence of nonspecifically bound DNA.22

Beads incubated with the 110-mer target DNA were
unable to block
the capillaries at any concentration tested (1 pM–1 fM), except
for one observation at 10 fM. To verify that the 110-mer target was
functional, we successfully detected it at 10 pM concentration (the
lower limit of detection found in our previous work with 20-mer target
DNA16). Permanent, reversible blocks were
successfully detected for the 235-mer targets down to 100 fM and for
the 419-mer and 1613-mer targets down to 10 fM. At 1 fM, no blockades
were obtained for target or control DNA of any length. Table 1 shows the results of the capillary blockade detection
for the different target and control DNA lengths as a function of
DNA concentration. In each of the three experiments shown, the 1613-mer
target DNA was detected at 10 fM.

All
control experiments showed either transient or no blockade
of the pore for all DNA lengths and concentrations measured, with
one exception. At 1 pM, the beads incubated with the 1503-mer control
initially showed a permanent block, which was not repeated following
voltage reversal; instead the previously blocking bead gave a transient
block. Thus, the devices yielded essentially no false positive results.

To simulate the detection of our target sequence against a background
of genomic DNA, we incubated PNA–beads with a solution containing
10 fM of the 1613-mer target sequence and 30 pM of the 1503-mer control
sequence. 30 pM 1503-mer DNA approximates the 4.6 Mb E. coli genome at 10 fM after shearing. Repeatable
permanent blocks of the capillary pore were observed (Table S-22, Supporting Information). As a control experiment,
we incubated the PNA–beads with 30 pM of 1503-mer DNA without
10 fM of the 1613-mer target sequence and observed no permanent or
transient blocks.

The successful detection of 1613-mer DNA at
10 fM concentration
is consistent with our hypothesis that the concentration limit of
detection could be lowered from 10 pM found in our previous work by
increasing the length of the DNA bound to the bead and therefore the
amount of charge imparted to the bead. By increasing the charge per
bound strand, we may be compensating for a decrease in electrophoretic
mobility resulting from a decreased number of bound DNA oligomers
per bead at lower DNA concentrations.

We may estimate the number
of bound DNA oligomers per bead using
Poisson statistics:  where μ
is the average number of DNA
molecules per bead and Pμ(v) is the probability of finding ν molecules on one
bead. Our 100 μL reaction volume contained 2.1 × 106 beads; and 10 fM DNA in this volume is approximately 6.0
× 105 molecules, which gives a bead-to-DNA ratio of
3.5:1 and a μ of 0.287 DNA/bead. With this μ, we obtain
the probability of a bead having zero bound DNA of P(0) = 0.751, probability of one bound DNA, P(1)
= 0.215, P(2) = 0.031, etc. Multiplication of these probabilities
by the total bead count yields the number of beads having a number
of bound DNA (Supporting Information, Table
S-23): 1.6 × 106 beads with no DNA, 4.5 × 105 beads with 1 bound DNA, 6.5 × 104 beads with
2 bound DNA, 6190 beads with 3 bound DNA, 443 beads with 4 bound DNA,
25 beads with 5 bound DNA, 1 with 6 bound DNA, and less than 1 with
more than 6 bound DNA. This analysis assumes that all DNA molecules
are bound to beads (and remain bound) and ignores the binding of the
noncomplementary DNA to the beads (the DNA after purification is double-stranded
and denatured before incubation with the beads, giving a complementary
and noncomplementary population of DNA). As such, it represents an
estimate of the maximum of the number of bound target DNA per bead.

Repeating this analysis with the same number of beads, but for
DNA detection at 1 fM gives μ = 0.0287, corresponding to 97.2%
of the beads bound to zero DNA molecules, 58 498 beads bound
to one DNA, 838 beads bound to 2 DNA, 8 beads bound to 3 DNA, and
less than 1 on average bound to more than 3 DNA (Supporting Information, Table S-24). On the basis of this
analysis, we suggest two possible reasons why the detection was successful
at 10 fM but not 1 fM. (1) Only beads containing 4, 5, or 6 DNA (present
at 10 fM but not 1 fM) have electrophoretic mobility sufficient to
block the capillary; (2) beads containing fewer bound DNA (e.g., 3)
can produce blockades; but less than 100% yield in bead preparation,
combined with the smaller numbers of these beads present at 1 fM (8
out of 2.1 × 106), combine to give a low probability
of blockage by such beads.

The assumption that almost all DNA
is bound to the beads is supported
by equilibrium calculations of DNA–PNA binding on the bead
surface (Supporting Information). A conservative
estimate of the number of carboxylic acid groups per bead is ∼107,23 and successful conjugation
of just 10% of these would result in 106 PNA/bead. Using
a PNA–DNA equilibrium constant of 109 M–1,24 we find that 97.2% of 10 fM DNA is
bound.

The results presented here suggest that it may be possible
to obtain
a lower concentration LOD with this device by further lengthening
the DNA target, which would impart more charge per bead. Also, an
increase in the length of the PNA probe, increasing the PNA–DNA
binding constant, would result in a larger DNA bound fraction at low
concentrations. For shorter DNA lengths, it may also be possible to
obtain a lower concentration LOD by decreasing the number of beads
used. According to our Poisson calculations, a 10-fold to 100-fold
decrease in bead count per experiment would increase μ and therefore
increase the number of beads bound to several DNA. For example, 1
fM DNA measured with 2.1 × 105 beads would result
in 619 beads with 3 DNA, 44 with 4 DNA, and 2 with 5 DNA. At 1 fM
DNA measured and 2.1 × 104 beads thousands of beads
bound to 4 or more DNA would result (Supporting
Information, Tables S-25 and S-26). However, in our 100 μL
reaction volume, 2.1 × 106 beads was the minimum usable
aliquot per experiment, given the limitations of pipetting, centrifugation,
and zeta potential measurement during bead preparation. The volumetric
limitation of our current hybridization procedure motivates a future
microfluidic approach to reduce our bead-to-DNA ratio and potentially
improve our detection limit beyond 10 fM.

Conclusions
As
we hypothesized, the detection limit of our device improved
from 10 pM to 10 fM with increased DNA length. At DNA concentrations
of 1 pM and 100 fM, the 110-mer target was not detectable, while longer
235-mer, 419-mer and 1613-mer targets were detectable. At 10 fM concentration,
only 419-mer and 1613-mer targets generated permanent blocks. Also,
these results suggest that the position of the complementary target
sequence does not impair detection in our platform. Both 419- and
1613-mers, with the target sequence positioned at the middle and end
of the strands, respectively, were detectable by our device at 10
fM concentration and above with no false positives. Thus, the complementary
probe sequence could be chosen from any position within the nucleic
acid target to obtain the highest specificity and capture efficiency.
In addition to detecting target sequences in an isolated environment,
we demonstrated detection in a simulated real sample with background
noncomplementary DNA, again with no false positives. These results
suggest the potential clinical usefulness of our device to detect
larger nucleic acids of length similar to 1613 bases, such as bacterial
16S rRNA. For example, given our ability to detect 1613-mer target
NA at ∼6 × 105 molecules/100 μL and an
average of 104 16S rRNA per bacterial cell, our device
should be capable of detecting ∼60 viable bacterial cells/100
μL (∼600 cells/mL), which is well below the clinically
important threshold level of 105 viable cells/mL in urine
that is indicative of infection.25 However,
the successful testing of our device with samples from complex media
such as urine has not yet been demonstrated and is the subject of
our current research.
