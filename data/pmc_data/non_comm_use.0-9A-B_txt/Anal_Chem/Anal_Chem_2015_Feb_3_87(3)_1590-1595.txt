Polymyxin is the last-line therapy
against Gram-negative ‘superbugs’;
however, dose-limiting nephrotoxicity can occur in up to 60% of patients
after intravenous administration. Understanding the accumulation and
concentration of polymyxin within renal tubular cells is essential
for the development of novel strategies to ameliorate its nephrotoxicity
and to develop safer, new polymyxins. We designed and synthesized
a novel dual-modality iodine-labeled fluorescent probe for quantitative
mapping of polymyxin in kidney proximal tubular cells. Measured by
synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microscopy, polymyxin concentrations
in single rat (NRK-52E) and human (HK-2) kidney tubular cells were
approximately 1930- to 4760-fold higher than extracellular concentrations.
Our study is the first to quantitatively measure the significant uptake
of polymyxin in renal tubular cells and provides crucial information
for the understanding of polymyxin-induced nephrotoxicity. Importantly,
our approach represents a significant methodological advancement in
determination of drug uptake for single-cell pharmacology.

==== Body
The world
is facing a significant
global medical challenge from Gram-negative ‘superbugs’,
particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter
baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, which
are resistant to almost all currently available antibiotics.1 The dry antibiotic discovery pipeline means that
there will be no new antibiotics available against these superbugs
for many years to come.1 ‘Old’
polymyxins, namely polymyxin B and colistin, are increasingly used
as the last-line therapy against these very problematic pathogens.2,3 Unfortunately, polymyxin-induced nephrotoxicity occurs in up to
60% of patients when administered intravenously and is the major dose-limiting
factor for their optimal clinical use.4,5 Polymyxin-induced
nephrotoxicity is associated with apoptosis and histopathological
damage to kidney tubular cells.6−8 After filtration by glomeruli,
polymyxins undergo extensive tubular reabsorption9,10 and
accumulate in the kidney as indicated by analysis of the concentration
in tissue homogenate.7 In addition, our
very recent clinical pharmacokinetic study reported, for the first
time, the very significant degree of exposure of renal tubular cells
to polymyxin B in humans.10 Accordingly,
quantifying the accumulation and concentration of polymyxin within
tubular cells is very important for the development of novel strategies
to ameliorate polymyxin-induced nephrotoxicity, as well as for the
discovery of safer, new-generation polymyxins. Unfortunately, to date
there are no experimental data on the disposition of polymyxin at
the tubular cellular level. Critical barriers include the design and
synthesis of a bona fide polymyxin probe, coupled
with the lack of methodology to determine polymyxin concentrations
in a single cell.

Quantification of intracellular drug concentrations
is very challenging
but crucial for understanding the mechanisms of drug toxicity.11−14 Current methodologies for quantification of drug concentrations
in mammalian cells are based on radiometry, bioassays, UV absorbance,
fluorescence emission, and mass spectrometry; however, none of these
methods is able to accurately measure the intracellular concentration
in single cells. The intracellular concentration of the highly nephrotoxic
cancer therapeutic cisplatin was measured using synchrotron X-ray
fluorescence microscopy (XFM); however, not all drugs contain platinum.15,16 Hence, innovative approaches to measure intracellular drug concentrations
are desperately needed. In the present study, a novel dual-modality
iodine-labeled fluorescent probe (FADDI-096) was designed and synthesized,
and a correlative microscopy approach was employed for quantitatively
mapping the intracellular accumulation of polymyxin in single kidney
tubular cells.

Experimental Section
Design of FADDI-096 Using
Molecular Modeling
The model
of FADDI-096 in complex with LPS from Escherichia coli was constructed.17 The coordinates of
the NMR solution structure of polymyxin B in interaction with E. coli LPS in solution were kindly provided by Pristovsek
and Kidric,18 and the dansyl-Gly substitution
and iodine were modeled onto the structure. The crystal structure
of the receptor of ferrichrome-iron in E. coli FhuA
(PDB code: 1QFF) was employed to derive the coordinates of LPS in E. coli.19 FADDI-096 was docked onto the LPS
molecule.17 POVRAY (Version 3.6; http://www.povray.org) was employed to render molecular representations.17

Reagents for Synthesis of FADDI-096
Piperidine, diisopropylethylamine
(DIPEA), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and 1H-benzotriazolium-1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-5-chloro-hexafluorophosphate-(1-),3-oxide
(HCTU) were obtained from Auspep (Melbourne, Australia). Fmoc-Dab(Boc)-OH,
Fmoc-d-Phe(4-Iodo)-OH, and Fmoc-Dab(ivDde)-OH were from Chem-Impex
International (U.S.A.). Fmoc-Thr(tBu)-OH was purchased from Mimotopes
(Melbourne, Australia). Fmoc-OctGly-OH was obtained from Try-lead
Chem (Hangzhou, China). Dimethylformamide (DMF), methanol (CH3OH), diethyl ether, dichloromethane (DCM), hydrochloric acid,
and acetonitrile were from Merck (Melbourne, Australia). Fmoc-Thr(tBu)-TCP-resin
was obtained from Intavis Bioanalytical Instruments (Koeln, Germany).
Dansylglycine, triisopropylsilane (TIPS), and diphenylphosphorylazide
(DPPA) were from Sigma-Aldrich (Castle Hill, Australia).

Synthesis of
FADDI-096
FADDI-096 was synthesized using
standard Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis techniques as described
previously.20 FADDI-096 TFA salt was obtained
as a white solid in a yield of 19.0 mg with purity of >95% (estimated
by RP-HPLC at 214 nm). The compound was confirmed as having the correct
molecular weight by ESI-MS analysis: m/z (monoisotopic) calculated: C71H116N19O16IS [M + H]+ 1649.76, [M + 2H]2+ 825.38; observed: [M + H]+ 1649.25, [M + 2H]2+ 825.50.

Antibacterial Activity of FADDI-096
Minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) of FADDI-096 was determined using the broth microdilution
method against P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (American
Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA).

Cell Culture and Preparation
of Cells for Microscopy
NRK-52E and HK-2 cells were obtained
from ATCC. NRK-52E cells were
cultured in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in DMEM (GlutaMAX-I).
HK-2 cells were cultured in keratinocyte serum-free medium (K-SFM).
Bovine pituitary extract (BPE, 0.05 mg/mL) and human recombinant epidermal
growth factor (EGF, 5 ng/mL) were used as supplements. All components
of the growth medium were purchased from Invitrogen (Life Technologies,
VIC, Australia). Both types of cells were grown at 37 °C in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. NRK-52E cells
were passaged three times per week and twice per week for HK-2 cells.
Cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, pH 7.4; Invitrogen) prior to use. Two milliliters of
NRK-52E (0.5 × 105 cells/mL) and HK-2 (0.25 ×
105 cells/mL) cells were seeded on silicon nitride windows
manufactured by Silson (Blisworth, U.K.) in 12-well plates in growth
medium and conditioned for 24 and 48 h, respectively. The medium was
then discarded by aspiration, and the cells were washed twice with
PBS. For the accumulation study, NRK-52E cells on the silicon nitride
windows were incubated with 5.0 and 50.0 μM FADDI-096 in DMEM
supplemented with 0.1% FBS, whereas HK-2 cells were incubated with
10.0 μM of FADDI-096 in K-SFM supplemented with BPE (0.05 mg/mL)
and EGF (5 ng/mL). After treatment, cells were fixed with a high-purity
solution of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) prepared in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS; pH 7.4). After drying under negative pressure inside
the biosafety cabinet, windows were used for fluorescence microscopy,
XFM and SEM.21

Oxidative Stress Induced
by FADDI-096 and Polymyxin B
Rat (NRK-52E) and human (HK-2)
kidney proximal tubular cells were
seeded on 8-well microslide chambers, and oxidative stress induced
by FADDI-096 and polymyxin B was studied using MitoSOX red (Molecular
Probes).22

Acquisition of Elemental
Maps using XFM
The elemental
content was determined using the Fresnel zone-plate hard X-ray microscope
at the Australian Synchrotron XFM beamline.23 The silicon nitride windows were mounted on an aluminum stalk and
scanned through an incident X-ray beam of 10.5 keV. This energy was
chosen to induce K-shell ionization of elements with atomic numbers
below 30 (Z ≤ Zn). The specimen was 15°
normal to the incoming X-ray beam and scanned through the focal plane
in steps of 800 nm (horizontal axis, x) and 800 nm
(vertical axis, y) orthogonal to the beam axis using
an integration of 1–1.5 s per scan point to ensure adequate
counting statistics. A silicon-drift diode detector (Vortex, SII NanoTechnology,
CA) oriented at 90° to the incident beam was used to detect the
resulting X-ray fluorescence. Elemental maps were generated from the
three-dimensional data sets (x, y, energy) using the MAPS software suite (v1.6.5).24 This procedure fitted the contribution of the K emission
lines for the elements: P, S, P, Cl, K, Ca, Fe, Cu and Zn along with
the iodine L lines, where appropriate. The absolute calibration to
areal densities (μg/cm2) was achieved by fitting
the fluorescence signal from thin-film standards SRM-1832 and SRM-1833
(National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD).
The spectra of the standard reference materials (SRM-1832 and SRM-1833)
were acquired. These spectra were employed to directly calculate the
actual element concentration of these measured elements in the sample
and the approximate concentration of other elements using known X-ray
fluorescence yield and absorption values.25 For each treatment, regions of interest containing 10 whole cells
map using XFM and the resulting quantity of iodine was used to establish
the equivalent amount of FADDI-096 on a per cell basis. An average
cell volume of 1000 μm3 was employed for calculation
of the average intracellular concentrations of FADDI-096 and other
elements.26

Accumulation of FADDI-096
Examined by Fluorescence Microscopy
and Identification of Cells with SEM
For fluorescence imaging,
a Deltavision Elite microscope (Applied Precision) equipped with a
TruLight Illumination System was utilized. Fluorescence images (Ex:
381–399 nm; Em: 523 ± 18 nm) of cells on silicon nitride
windows with or without treatments were acquired using a CoolSNAP
HQ2 camera with a 20× (0.75 NA) lens and softWoRx software (Applied
Precision). After acquisition of an XFM or the fluorescence image,
the approximate location of the cell on the silicon nitride windows
was chartered. A low magnification (20× or 40×) optical
image was also taken to document the local cell morphology for the
subsequent SEM imaging. The silicon nitride windows were mounted on
standard aluminum stubs with double-sided carbon tape for SEM imaging.
Sputter coating was performed with a sputter coater (Emitech K550X,
Quorum Technologies Ltd., U.K.) to add a thin layer of gold to reduce
charging. The samples were then transferred to an FEI Helios NanoLab
600 DualBeam FIB-SEM electron microscope (FEI Company, Hillsboro,
OR). During SEM acquisition, low accelerating voltage 2 kV was selected,
and electron signals were acquired using a secondary electron (SE)
detector or a mixed mode of SE and backscattering electron (BSE) signals.

Prior to correlation, images acquired with different correlative
microscopy methods were first resized to the same scale/pixel size.
Markers (e.g., cluster of cells and corner of the silicon nitride
window) were employed to identify the target single cells for imaging
with multiple microscopy approaches. Rotation and translation of a
cell, if necessary, were achieved either manually or through cross-correlation
algorithm.

Results and Discussion
Design and Synthesis of
the Polymyxin Probe
In the
present study, a novel strategy was employed for the creation of a
dual-modality polymyxin probe (FADDI-096) based upon our polymyxin
structure–activity relationship (SAR) model.17,27 We hypothesized that labeling the core polymyxin scaffold (Figure 1) with nonradioactive iodine (XFM contrast) and
a dansyl fluorophore (for fluorescence microscopy) would generate
a molecular probe which made possible the quantitative mapping of
the intracellular accumulation of polymyxin in single kidney tubular
cells. It was a formidable challenge to design such a polymyxin probe,
while not interfering with the structural elements of the polymyxin
molecule required for its antimicrobial and nephrotoxic activities.
Iodine was chosen as a contrast agent for XFM in the present study
because of its strong anomalous diffraction.28 The most viable option for the incorporation of the iodine was via
the d-phenylalanine residue at position 6 (Figure 1). This is because aryl halides are inherently more
stable than alkyl halides, an important consideration for an iodine-containing
probe used to map distribution in a biological system. Furthermore,
as the phenyl ring is involved in the hydrophobic interaction with
the fatty acyl chains of lipid A in the outer membrane of Gram-negative
bacterial cells, it appeared to be the ideal position for accommodating
the hydrophobic iodine atom.17,27 The incorporation was
achieved using D-4-iodophenylalanine that was commercially
available in its Fmoc-protected form. For the fluorescent component
of the probe, a dansyl group was utilized due to its strong fluorescence
and relatively small size that would not impose a significant steric
effect.29 Commercially available dansyl-polymyxin
B is not suitable for investigations on the mechanisms of polymyxin-induced
nephrotoxicity, as it is inactive against Gram-negative pathogens
due to the attachment of up to five dansyl moieties to the diaminobutyric
acid (Dab) residues (Figure 1a).29 Based upon our SAR model of the interaction
of polymyxin B with lipid A, modeling of FADDI-096 with lipid A from E. coli was performed (Figure 1b,
c) and clearly envisaged that the most appropriate point of attachment
of the dansyl group would be at the N-terminus of
the polymyxin structure.17,29 Therefore, our strategy
was to replace the N-terminal fatty acyl group with L-octylglycine. The eight-carbon side chain of this residue
mimicked the N-terminal fatty acyl chain of polymyxin
B. To avoid the need for additional orthogonal protection during the
synthesis, the N-α-amino group was employed
as a convenient point of attachment for the dansyl group. A glycine
linker was incorporated between the dansyl group and the L-octylglycine to reduce the overall rigidity of the N-terminal construct, which appears to be more favorable for binding
with lipid A (fluorescent spectra of the probe is provided as Supporting Information, Figure S1).29

FADDI-096 with LPS: (a) polymyxin B1, (b) FADDI-096, (c) molecular
model of the complex between Escherichia coli LPS
with FADDI-096.

Our novel molecular probe
was synthesized using optimized Fmoc
solid-phase methodology that we developed in our laboratory for the
routine total synthesis of new polymyxin analogues. Electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis in positive ion mode confirmed
that the end product had a molecular weight consistent with the structure
of FADDI-096 (purity >95%). FADDI-096 displayed antibacterial activity
with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 8 mg/L against a
wild-type polymyxin-susceptible reference strain P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (polymyxin B MIC 1–2
mg/L). Furthermore, similar to polymyxin B, FADDI-096 induced oxidative
stress in both rat and human kidney proximal tubular cells (Figure 2a, b), which is associated with polymyxin-induced
nephrotoxicity.6,30,31 Together, these results demonstrate that the modifications introduced
into the polymyxin B scaffold to produce FADDI-096 did not compromise
the antibacterial activity or the ability to induce oxidative stresses
that are associated with the native polymyxin B molecule.

Quantitative Mapping of Polymyxin in Kidney Tubular Cells
To quantitatively map the intracellular accumulation of FADDI-096
in single rat and human kidney tubular cells, we first conducted fluorescence
microscopy followed by XFM imaging of the same samples. Furthermore,
SEM was employed to correlate the individual cells with the intracellular
distribution of FADDI-096 detected by fluorescence microscopy and
XFM (Figure 3a–c). Our fluorescence
microscopy results revealed that FADDI-096 localized throughout the
cytoplasm and nuclear region (Figure 3a). We
further investigated the drug localization and accumulation on a single-cell
level using XFM which allowed for the monitoring of the migration
of FADDI-096 into the cells (Figure 3a). The
intracellular distribution of FADDI-096 observed via XFM was highly
consistent with the fluorescence microscopy imaging results (Figure 3a), demonstrating the overlap of the dansyl and
iodine signals from FADDI-096 itself.

Figure 3 Accumulation of FADDI-096 in NRK-52E and
HK-2 cells determined
with fluorescence microscopy (FM), X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM),
and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). (a) NRK-52E cells (i) without
treatment, (ii) treated with 5 μM FADDI-096 for 4 h, (iii) treated
with 50 μM FADDI-096 for 1 h, (iv) treated with 50 μM
FADDI-096 for 4 h; and HK-2 cells (v) without treatment, (vi) treated
with 10 μM FADDI-096 for 4 h. The row labeled with “XFM”
shows the iodine distribution within the same NRK-52E and HK-2 cells
as described in panel a. Iodine signal intensities are shown using
a linear scale from zero to the maximum value; the yellow numbers
at the top left of the relevant panels note the maximum pixel value
(μg/cm2) in each sample. (b) Accumulation of FADDI-096,
in single NRK-52E and HK-2 cells as described in panel a, measured
via iodine content using XFM (mean ± SD; n =
10). ****p < 0.0001 compared with control samples.
(c) Correlation of signals from different microscopes including FM
(green), XFM (blue to red), and SEM (gray). Scale bar: 10 μm.

With the intracellular concentrations
determined by the high sensitivity
of synchrotron XFM, it is evident that the uptake of FADDI-096 by
rat kidney tubular NRK-52E cells was dependent on the concentration
and duration of the treatment (Figure 3b).
Uptake at 4 h was significantly higher in the rat kidney tubular cells
treated with 50 μM of FADDI-096 (overall intracellular concentration
110 ± 28.2 mM), compared to the cells treated with 5 μM
of FADDI-096 (23.8 ± 6.63 mM). The approximately 4.62-fold increase
in overall intracellular concentration resulting from a 10-fold increase
in the concentration of the bathing solution is consistent with a
saturable (carrier-mediated) component of the cellular uptake process
of polymyxin.32 The overall concentration
of FADDI-096 in human kidney tubular HK-2 cells was 31.0 ± 5.69
mM after treatment at a concentration of 10 μM for 4 h. Interestingly,
the XFM results also revealed a significant increase in the intracellular
calcium concentration (Figure 4), which is
a potential stimulus to trigger apoptosis.33 Cellular distributions of other elements were also evaluated for
all samples (detailed results are provided in the Supporting Information, Figure S2). The exceptional intracellular
accumulation of the polymyxin probe in rat and human kidney tubular
cells supports the recent finding of the time- and concentration-dependence
of apoptosis caused by polymyxin.34 For
example, the overall concentration of FADDI-096 in HK-2 cells (31.0
± 5.69 mM) was approximately 3100-fold higher than the concentration
in the bathing solution (10 μM) (Figure 3b). Collectively, our XFM data on events at the cellular level are
consistent with the very substantial tubular reabsorption of polymyxin
observed at the whole-body level in rats and humans.9,10 While those previous observations provide valuable information on
mass transfer events in vivo, our results for the
first time offer insight on the spatial and temporal accumulation
of polymyxin in single tubular cells.

concentration and accumulation
of FADDI-096 in single rat kidney tubular NRK-52E cells. Cells were
treated without or with 5 μM FADDI-096 for 4 h, 50 μM
FADDI-096 for 1 h, and 50 μM FADDI-096 for 4 h (r = 0.62; p ≤ 0.0001 from Pearson correlation).

Conclusion
In
the battle against life-threatening infections caused by Gram-negative
‘superbugs’, we cannot rely on the discovery of new
antibiotics. We must optimize the clinical use of the last-line polymyxin
and ameliorate the dose-limiting nephrotoxicity through a better understanding
of the mechanism. The quantitative aptitude of XFM presented here
expands the horizon of measuring drug concentrations in cells. Importantly,
our study is the first to conceptualize the chemistry of a unique
dual-modality probe for the combined use of correlative microscopy
to determine the uptake of drugs in individual cells. This approach
represents a significant methodological advancement for single-cell
pharmacology.
