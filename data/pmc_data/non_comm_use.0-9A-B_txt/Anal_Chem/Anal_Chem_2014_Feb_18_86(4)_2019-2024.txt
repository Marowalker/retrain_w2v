In
the present paper, trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS)
and theoretical calculations have been used to study carotenoid geometrical
motifs generated by photoisomerization from the all-trans geometry. Multiple geometric isomers of the carotenoids lutein and
zeaxanthin were separated using TIMS (R > 110) for [M]+, [M + H]+, and [M – 18]+ molecular
species. Comparison of observed cross sections with those obtained
from molecular dynamics calculations showed that the number of cis double bonds and s-cis single bonds in the polyene chain determine the topology space of the carotenoid.
The intensities of IMS signals are correlated with the relative stability
of these geometric isomers.1,2 The most stable isomer
is the all-trans geometry regardless of the ionization
state ([M – 18]+, [M]+, and [M + H]+), and structural stability decreases with the increasing
number of cis and/or s-cis bonds
in the polyene chain.

==== Body
Carotenoid
pigments are found
throughout nature where they serve a variety of roles.3 Synthesized de novo only in plants, algae, bacteria, and
fungi, they are essential to photosynthesis, function as antioxidants,
and are involved in the coloration in many animals as well as plants.4 For animals including humans, conversion of pro-vitamin-A
carotenoids to retinal is essential to health, and the hydroxyl-carotenoids
(lutein, zeaxanthin, and meso-zeaxanthin) function
to protect the central retina from photo-oxidative damage (see more
details in reviews5−7). The biological function of carotenoids is intrinsically
influenced by their end-group type, functionalization, and geometric
topology as controlled by steroisomerism of polyene double bonds and
conformational flexibility.6,8,9 In nature, carotenoids are found in a variety of environments ranging
from hydrophobic and low dielectric lipid membranes and structures
to sites at the interface with the polar aqueous medium of the cell.10−12 In aqueous environments, carotenoids are associated with specific
binding proteins13 or general purpose lipid
transport proteins.14 The structural features
that dominate the functionality of carotenoids also influence their
conformational dynamics.6 Although the
conformational flexibility of carotenoids with respect to the ionone
end groups has been well described,9 the
conformational role associated with s-cis orientations of “single” bonds of the polyene chain
have not been widely considered when describing the range in topologies
of carotenoids and their functionality. In a given physiological environment,
carotenoid topological space is determined by a number of factors
(e.g., electrostatic interactions with the solvent, principally H-bonding
with oxygen functionalities in xanthophylls, entropic effects, and
isomerization of the polyene chain). There is considerable interest
in understanding how structural diversity between carotenoids as well
as the dynamic structural interconversion of geometric isomers15−17 and conformers dictate the biological selectivity leading to specific
uptake, transport, and binding of these molecules.6,18,19

During the past decade, the use of
ion mobility spectrometry (IMS)
combined with molecular dynamic simulations has proven to be a versatile
technique for the analysis of intermediate and equilibrium structures
of biomolecules enabling the correlation of ion-neutral, collision
cross sections (CCS) with candidate structures.20,21 In particular, it has been shown that IMS permits the inspection
of the topological dynamics with the ability to follow structural
changes as a function of the solvent conditions, as well as bath gas
type and temperature over millisecond time scales.22,23 Using this approach, it has been shown that isomerization in the
peptide backbone can define the topological space accessible to a
biomolecule.21 Pierson et al. have recently
demonstrated the influence of cis-trans (E/Z) isomers on peptide conformation for
proline-containing peptides using ion mobility spectrometry.23 Analogous to this effect in peptides, here we
expect that cis-trans geometrical isomerization of
the carotenoid polyene chain will significantly influence the topology
of these biological structures. In addition, the polyene chain of
the carotenoids can exist in a large number of conformers originating
from the s-cis/s-trans geometry associated with the
single bonds of the conjugated system.24 The recent advent of trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS)25 enables the study of small mobility ranges with
high mobility resolution and is expected to permit a detailed characterization
of the carotenoid geometrical isomers and conformers.

In this
study, we present evidence that carotenoid topology differences
of the cis-trans geometrical isomers and s-cis conformers are directly observable in two carotenoid
systems: lutein and zeaxanthin. Despite the significant biological
activity of carotenoids, the role played by their structural topologies
associated with the cis-trans isomerization and s-cis conformer interconversion with the polyene chain remains
a topic of investigation.18 Our experimental
observations and theoretical analysis demonstrate that these cis-trans associated motifs of the polyene chain are the
main factor governing the carotenoid structural topology, and their
abundance parallels the relative stability of carotenoid geometric
isomers.2,16

Experimental Section
Carotenoid Samples
Carotenoid samples were extracted
from marigold flowers,26 a common commercial
source of lutein and zeaxanthin. Lutein- and zeaxanthin-containing
extracts were purified by preparative reversed-phase HPLC (Phenomenox
ODS Ultracarb 3 μm, 250 mm × 4.6 mm column) with acetonitrile/methanol/TEA
(85%/15%/0.1% v/v) as a mobile phase. Final purity of the individual all-trans carotenoids was confirmed by
UV–vis detection (300–500 nm)7 and by mass spectrometry.

Structural Separation by TIMS-MS
Details regarding
TIMS operation and differences from traditional IMS can be found elsewhere.25 TIMS mobility separation utilizes an electric
field to hold ions stationary against a moving gas, so that the drift
force is compensated by the electric field. This concept follows the
idea of a parallel flow ion mobility analyzer,27 with the main difference being that ions are also confined
radially using a quadrupolar field to guarantee higher ion transmission
and sensitivity. The separation in a TIMS device can be described
by the center of the mass frame using the same principles as in a
conventional IMS drift tube.28,29 Because mobility separation
is related to the number of ion-neutral collisions (or drift time
in traditional drift tube cells), the mobility separation in a TIMS
device depends on the bath gas drift velocity, ion confinement, and
ion elution parameters. The mobility, K, of an ion
in a TIMS cell is described by: 1  where vg, E, Velution, and Vbase are the velocity
of the gas, applied electric field,
elution voltage, and base voltage, respectively. The constant A, which accounts for the velocity of gas, can be determined
using calibration standards of known mobilities. In TIMS operation,
multiple geometric isomers/conformers are trapped simultaneously at
different E values resulting from a voltage gradient
applied across the IMS cell. After thermalization, geometrical isomers/conformers
are eluted by decreasing the electric field in stepwise decrements
(referred to as the “ramp”). Each isomer/conformer eluting
from the TIMS cell can be described by a characteristic voltage gradient
(i.e., Velution – Vbase). Eluted ions
are then mass analyzed and detected by a maXis impact Q-ToF mass spectrometer
(Bruker, Billerica, MA). The elution voltage, Velution, can be calculated from the elution time: 2a  and 2b  where V0 is the
initial potential at the entrance to the TIMS analyzer, r is the rate at which the potential is ramped, Telute is the time at which the ion elutes, Tramp is the total ramp time, Ttotal is the total time for a single TIMS experiment, Ttrap is the time before the mobility analysis (i.e., to
inject ions into the TIMS trap), and TOF is the time between elution
of the ion and detection of the ion at the TOF detector.

The
TIMS funnel was controlled using in-house software, written in National
Instruments LabVIEW, and synchronized with the maXis Impact Q-ToF
acquisition program (more details in ref (25)). Separation was performed using nitrogen as
a bath gas at ≈300 K, and the gas flow velocity was controlled
by the pressure difference between the front (P1) and back (P2) of the TIMS analyzer. P1 and P2 values
were set to 2.6 and 1.0 mbar for all experiments. The same RF (880
kHz and 200–350 Vpp) was applied to all electrodes including
the entrance funnel, the mobility separating section, and the exit
funnel. An atmospheric pressure photoionization source (APPI, Apolo
II Bruker Daltonics, Inc., MA) using a Kr lamp with main emission
bands at 10.0 and 10.6 eV was used for all the analyses.

A Tuning
Mix mass spectrometry standard (Tunemix, G2421A, Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was used as a mobility calibration
standard. Details on the Tunemix structures (e.g., m/z = 322 K0 = 1.376
cm2 V–1 s–1, m/z = 622 K0 = 1.013 cm2 V–1 s–1, and m/z = 922 K0 = 0.835 cm2 V–1 s–1) can be found in ref (30). Carotenoid samples (lutein
and zeaxanthin) were reconstituted in a 70:30 acetonitrile/methanol
solution to a final concentration of 1–10 nM. Toluene (8.8
eV IP), acetone (9.7 eV IP), or anisole (8.2 eV IP) were used as APPI
additives at a concentration of 10% (v/v) to enhance ionization31 and to study the effect of solvent conditions
on ionization patterns and relative proportions of geometrical isomers/conformers
formed during the photoionization process. For simplicity, lutein
samples were only analyzed with added anisole APPI. Mobility values
(K) were correlated with CCS (Ω) using the
equation: 3  where z is the charge of
the ion, kB is the Boltzmann constant,
N* is the number density, and mI and mb refer to the masses of the ion and bath gas,
respectively.28

Instrumental parameters
were optimized to achieve the highest IMS
resolution for the carotenoid molecular ions. A peak width (i.e.,
fwhm of the mobility peak) that corresponds to a single isomer was
measured using the sphere-like tune mix mobility standard series.
In addition, to ensure that the IMS peak width was not influenced
by the number of ions in the TIMS cell (i.e., columbic effects compromising
ion trapping), a dilution series (1:10–1:103) of
the tune mix was used to determine the mobility peak width as a function
of the concentration in all APPI solvent conditions. No significant
variation in the IMS peak width was observed beyond a 1:100 fold dilution.
The 622 m/z (K0 = 1.013 cm2 V–1 s–1, CCS = 202 Å2) component yielded a 1.74 Å2 peak width and was used as a reference for the peaks observed
for the carotenoid isomers. Under these experimental conditions, a
mobility resolution of over 110 was obtained in the TIMS analyzer
(more details in the Supporting Information).

Theoretical Calculations
A pool of candidate structures
with varying numbers of cis bond geometries of the
polyene chain (including s-cis and s-trans conformations) for the lutein and zeaxanthin molecular and fragment
ions were generated and optimized at the B3LYP/G-311G level.24 Energies of formation were calculated for all
the obtained structures after a series of simulated annealing and
geometry optimization cycles using AMBER03 force field in YASARA32 (analogous to method A described in ref (21)). Candidate structures
were then submitted to MOBCAL33 to determine
theoretical K0 and CCS values (assuming
helium as a bath gas) using the projection approximation (PA), the
elastic hard sphere scattering (EHSS) and the trajectory (TM) methods
(values are provided in the Supporting Information). It is known that
for small molecules, deviations between these three methods due to
the structural and elemental composition can be observed.33 In order to evaluate theoretical CCS in nitrogen,
an empirical formula was obtained by correlating theoretical (in helium
using the EHSS) and experimental (in nitrogen using TIMS) CCS of polyaromatic
hydrocarbons (PAH) standards (12 compounds): CCS(N2) =
1.1606 × CCS(He) + 41.547 [Å2], (R2 = 0.9912). The use of PAH standards is justified by
the composition and elemental similarity to carotenoids and by their
small structural flexibility.

Results and Discussion
The TIMS-MS analysis demonstrates that ion abundance and ionization
state vary with the APPI solvent condition. In particular, consistent
with the report of Rivera et al.31 the
observation of a carotenoid molecular ion, protonated ion, or fragment
ion vary with the solvent conditions during the APPI process and is
specific to each carotenoid (Figure 1). For
zeaxanthin, [M]+ molecular ions were observed when 10%
anisole and toluene were used as additives to the 70:30 acetonitrile/methanol
solution, although [M + H]+ molecular ions were observed
when 10% acetone was utilized. For lutein, a [M – 18]+ fragment ion predominates with a 70:30 acetonitrile/methanol solution
containing 10% anisole. The predominance of the [M – 18]+ ion over that of [M]+ originates from the facile
loss of water due to the allylic 3′-hydroxyl leading to the
stabilized [M – 18]+ ion, a process unavailable
to the secondary 3- and 3′-hydroxyls of zeaxanthin.12,34

Figure 1 Typical
MS profiles for zeaxanthin and lutein for APPI solvents
conditions (acetone, anisole, and toluene in 70:30 acetonitrile/methanol).
Notice the difference in molecular ionization as a function of the
APPI solvent and the carotenoid structure.

Multiple cis geometric isomers and presumably
also s-cis conformers of zeaxanthin and lutein are
observed in the IMS analysis (Figure 2). Each
peak assigned in Figure 2 (denoted by a Gaussian
profile) has a broader IMS peak width than expected when considering
a single analyte (e.g., from m/z = 622 of the tune mix series). The broadening of the peaks may be
explained by the following: (i) the existence of multiple isomers
with nearly identical CCSs that cannot be resolved or (ii) isomers
that interconvert under the experimental conditions (e.g., effective
temperature, experiment time scale, etc.). However, no variations
in the IMS profiles were observed over different trapping times (e.g.,
100–500 ms), which suggests that differences in the observed
IMS profiles are attributable to a distribution of geometric isomers/conformers
that exist as solvated carotenoid ions formed during the photoionization
process (e.g., Figure 2a,c vs Figure 2b). That is, ion-neutral collisions during the TIMS
separation with the residual gas does not seem to contribute to the
IMS distribution, but solvent conditions during APPI do.

spectra of zeaxanthin and lutein with acetonitrile/methanol
70:30 APPI solvent conditions and various additives (from top to bottom):
[M + H]+ zeaxanthin with acetone, [M]+ zeaxanthin
with anisole, [M]+ zeaxanthin with toluene, and [M –
18]+ lutein with anisole. IMS peaks A–F have been
designated in the spectra and are depicted using Gaussian profiles.

Candidate structures were proposed
for the most abundant IMS peaks
(see Table 1 and Figure 3). A general trend is that the most abundant IMS peak, A, corresponds
to the all-trans geometric isomer for both carotenoids
(the single isomer present in the starting solutions). Moreover, the
predominance of the all-trans geometric isomer is
also anticipated due to its higher stability relative to other isomers
for both carotenoid ions (lutein and zeaxanthin).2,35 Other
geometric isomers/conformers with increasing numbers of cis double bonds (and/or s-cis bonds) are assigned
to the IMS peaks B–D and were formed during the APPI process.
IMS peak B is assigned to the 13-cis and 15-cis geometric isomers which were calculated to have the
same CCS values; however, the 15-cis isomer is energetically
more stable, its low kinetic barrier conversion back to the all-trans isomer is facile, and its abundance
in thermally equilibrated samples is small.17,18,36 Similarly, the IMS peaks C and D have been
assigned as 9-cis and 9,13′-di-cis (or 13,9′-di-cis) candidate structures,
respectively. Overlapping conformers having s-cis and di-s-cis geometries within
the polyene chain are also assigned to these IMS bands and can contribute
to the broadening. Isomer bands E and F are the result of the presence
of multiple s-cis bonds and cis double
bonds in the polyene chain (for additional information on potential
candidate structures see the Supporting Information). The lower stability
of the geometric isomers E and F translates to the low abundance observed
in Figure 2. A similar trend was observed for
[M – 18]+ lutein isomers. The IMS peak A′
can be correlated with the all-trans candidate structure,
the IMS peaks C′ and D′ can be correlated with the 9-cis and 9,13′-di-cis (or 13, 9′-cis) candidate structures, respectively. Isomer bands E′
and F′ are the result of the presence of multiple s-cis and cis double bonds in the polyene chain (for
additional information on potential candidate structures, see the
Supporting Information). Although several potential candidate structures
can be assigned to the isomer bands depicted in Figure 2, assignment has been made on the basis of structural stability.

number of cis-trans isomerization in the polyene
chain.

Overall, the stability of the cis-trans geometrical
isomers/s-cis conformational structures parallels
the relative abundances of the IMS spectra. Slight variations are
to be expected, because the geometrical isomers were generated by
the photoionization process from the all-trans form
of the lutein and zeaxanthin isomers (e.g., incomplete photoisomerization).
Solvent composition may be expected to influence the abundances of
ions generated during photoionization; nevertheless, isomers of higher
stability will be energetically more favorable. For example, IMS peak
B in the analysis of zeaxanthin varied in abundance under different
solvent conditions. A lower relative abundance of the 13-cis and 15-cis isomers (isomer band B) was observed
when using solvent containing 10% (v/v) anisole or toluene as compared
to a solvent system lacking this aromatic component. This example
shows the influence of the initial APPI ionization state on the distribution
of zeaxanthin geometrical isomers/conformers and consequently on the
IMS profile. That is, experimental data suggest that the distribution
of carotenoid geometrical isomers/conformers observed in these TIMS
experiments depend on the presence of the aromatic hydrocarbon additive.
Relative geometrical isomer/conformer abundances may be modulated
by the probability of ionization of a given isomer during the APPI
process31 (e.g., [M]+ or [M
+ H]+), and this could define the relative isomer/conformer
abundances; although the process of ionization was not addressed directly
in the present study, the differences of the theoretical CCS values
of [M + H]+ and [M]+ are much smaller than the
differences in CCS attributable to the number of cis bonds in the polyene chain of the proposed candidate structures.
Similar IMS trends between [M + H]+ zeaxanthin and [M –
18]+ lutein suggest that the loss of hydroxyl group does
not influence the distribution of observed species that are attributable
entirely to the carotenoid backbone geometry. A comparison with conclusions
obtained from NMR solution studies of zeaxanthin and lutein geometrical
isomers is in good agreement with the most abundant candidate structures
proposed in this study.37

Carotenoids
are often bound within proteins where they serve a
variety of functions.13,38 The versatility that results
from the ability of the polyene chain to exist in a variety of topologically
distinct forms separated by low energetic barriers provides these
molecules the ability to adjust topologically to protein constraints
and also presents a subtle means to influence the electronic energy
levels of the carotenoid.10,38,39 Within the crystal structure of apocarotenoid-15,15-oxygenase, the
substrate carotenoid is found to be bound in a cis-isomeric geometry. Upon binding, three adjacent double bonds undergo
isomerization from a trans-trans-trans to a cis-trans-cis geometry.38 The
cleavage enzyme responsible for the formation of 9-cis -violoxanthin and 9′-cis-neoxanthin is another
example of a protein in which the carotenoid binds to a protein.40 Numerous other examples of carotenoid binding
proteins include light harvesting protein (to which four carotenoids
2 luteins, zeaxanthin, and 9-cis-neoxanthin are bound),41 α-crustacyanin from lobster (which binds
astaxanthin),42 human steroidal acute regulatory
domain protein (STAR D 3, which binds lutein),43 and the human glutathione transferase Pi I (which binds
zeaxanthin).44 In addition, the inspection
of X-ray structures of hydroxyl carotenoids within three proteins
(IM98,45 3PL9,46 and 1RWT47) shows that the hydrogen bonds
link the terminal ring of the carotenoid molecule to the protein binding
site. That is, the topological space of the carotenoids in biological
processes can adopt multiple forms, and evidence suggests that they
play a dominant role in the biological function of carotenoid binding
proteins.

Conclusions
In the current study, TIMS-MS combined
with theoretical calculations
demonstrates that carotenoid geometric isomers/conformers of lutein
and zeaxanthin are separately observable. For the first time, ion-neutral
CCSs of zeaxanthin and lutein geometric isomers/conformers are reported
and compared with theoretical calculations of candidate structures.
The abundance of the individual carotenoid isomers/conformers were
observed to be consistent with their relative stability: the larger
the intensity in the IMS profile, the more stable the structure. As
anticipated, larger numbers of cis and/or s-cis bonds generally correspond to smaller CCS values.
This study highlights the potential of TIMS-MS combined with theoretical
calculations to describe the topological space for low molecular weight
biological molecules.
