Tandem mass spectrometry for the
multiplex and quantitative analysis
of enzyme activities in dried blood spots on newborn screening cards
has emerged as a powerful technique for early assessment of lysosomal
storage diseases. Here we report the design and process-scale synthesis
of substrates for the enzymes α-l-iduronidase, iduronate-2-sulfatase,
and N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase that are used
for newborn screening of mucopolysaccharidosis types I, II, and VI.
The products contain a bisamide unit that is hypothesized to readily
protonate in the gas phase, which improves detection sensitivity by
tandem mass spectrometry. The products contain a benzoyl group, which
provides a useful site for inexpensive deuteration, thus facilitating
the preparation of internal standards for the accurate quantification
of enzymatic products. Finally, the reagents are designed with ease
of synthesis in mind, thus permitting scale-up preparation to support
worldwide newborn screening of lysosomal storage diseases. The new
reagents provide the most sensitive assay for the three lysosomal
enzymes reported to date as shown by their performance in reactions
using dried blood spots as the enzyme source. Also, the ratio of assay
signal to that measured in the absence of blood (background) is superior
to all previously reported mucopolysaccharidosis types I, II, and
VI assays.

==== Body
Newborn screening
of a subset
of lysosomal storage diseases is an important new area of laboratory
medicine since treatments are available for these diseases, and early
initiation of treatment often leads to a better clinical outcome.1,2 We have
been developing the use of tandem mass spectrometry for the multiplex
assay of several lysosomal enzymes in dried blood spots on newborn
screening cards.3−8 The method allows for the quantification of enzymatically formed
product by including an internal standard, which is structural similar
to the enzymatic product or structurally identical but with heavy
isotope substitution. The methodology has been provided in different
formats for the sample preparation steps prior to mass spectrometry.9−18 The simplest solution that works well seems to be liquid–liquid
extraction with organic solvent followed by flow injection into the
tandem mass spectrometer.15,19

Reagents for
tandem mass spectrometry analysis of six lysosomal
enzymes are currently prepared by Genzyme Corporation and distributed
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The latter has
also developed standard, quality control dried blood spots, thus providing
a consistent set of samples to be used by newborn screening laboratories
worldwide.20 These reagents have been used
in different pilot studies, which have helped to validate newborn
screening for lysosomal storage diseases19,21−24 (as well as unpublished studies in Taiwan and Illinois).

Scheme 1 shows the structure of the substrates
developed by us previously for the tandem mass spectrometry assay
of the enzymes relevant to Pompe disease and mucopolysaccharidosis-I
(MPS-I).3,5 The MPS-I substrate contains the fluorogenic
7-hydroxycoumarin unit, thus allowing this reagent to be used for
fluorometric assays of α-l-iduronidase (the enzyme
relevant to MPS-I) in addition to tandem mass spectrometry. However, it is now clear
that tandem mass spectrometry-based lysosomal enzyme analysis offers
distinct advantages over fluorometric assays. First, the background
signal seen in the tandem mass spectrometry assay when substrate is
omitted is virtually zero (i.e., no components of blood other than
enzymatic product are detected in the product mass spectrometry ion-selective
channels), whereas nonproduct components of the blood contribute to
significant autofluorescence in the fluorometric assay. This leads
to a much higher assay-to-blank ratio for the tandem mass spectrometry
assay versus the fluorometric assay and to a much more accurate assessment
of enzymatic activity in the low-end range. This in turn is expected
to lead to a much lower rate of false positives in newborn screening
of lysosomal storage diseases. Furthermore, there is no fluorometric
assay reagent that leads to reliable newborn screening of Niemann–Pick
type-A/B disease as available fluorometric reagents give a significant
false negative rate. This is due to a prevalent pathogenic mutation
in the population that leads to low enzymatic activity with the natural
sphingomyelin substrate but a high activity with the artificial fluorometric
substrate.25,26 The tandem mass spectrometry
assay uses a substrate that is similar in structure to the natural
substrate (the only difference is the length of the fatty acyl group
attached to the sphingosine amino group); the false negative problem
is not an issue with this technique.

Scheme 1 The Pompe and MPS-I
products are shown in Scheme 2. Recently, we
have observed that the Pompe product gives
an ∼10-fold higher signal per mole in the tandem mass spectrometer
compared to the MPS-I product.12 A detailed
theoretical study suggests that the bisamide unit of the Pompe product
allows for a particularly stable protonated ion species in the gas
phase as shown in Scheme 2.27 Given this enhanced sensitivity and the lack of need for
the fluorometric 7-hydroxycoumarin unit, we decided to prepare new
substrates for MPS-I, -II, and -VI that contain the type of aglycone
present in the Pompe reagent. These new reagents are also simpler
to synthesize compared to the 7-hydroxycoumarin containing reagents.
In the current study we present synthesis of the new reagents, show
that they can be scaled up to amounts needed to support worldwide
newborn screening, and show that they display enhanced tandem mass
spectrometry performance compared to the original reagents.

Scheme 2 Experimental Section
Materials
Full details for the synthesis
of all new
reagents is given as Supporting Information. Patent applications have been filed with the U.S. Patent Office
for the compounds described in this study. Buffers to assay MPS-I,
-II, and -VI were as follows: MPS-I, 100 mM ammonium formate (Sigma),
pH 4.4, 10 g/L sodium taurocholate (Sigma); MPS-II, MPS-I buffer plus
7.5 mM barium(II) acetate (Sigma), 5.0 mM cerium(III) acetate (Sigma);
MPS-VI, MPS-II buffer plus 150 μM 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-glucono-1,5-lactone
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology). All dried blood spots were obtained with
Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval at the University of Washington.
Dried blood spots were stored at −10 to −20 °C
in closed jars with desiccant.

Enzymatic Assays
MPS-I assays used a 3 mm dried blood
spot punch in a 96-deep well plate (1 mL round-bottom Corning Costar,
Fisher, cat. no. 09-761-116A). To the punch was added 30 μL
of buffer containing 500 μM MPS-I substrate and 3.5 μM
MPS-I internal standard. Substrate and internal standard were added
to a vial from stock solutions in methanol, the solvent was removed
in a centrifugal evaporator (Speed-Vac), and assay buffer was added
followed by vortex mixing to prepare the stock solution, which could
be stored at −10 to −20 °C for at least a few months.
The plate was sealed with sealing film (AxySeal, VWR International,
cat. no. 10011-117) for overnight (16 h) incubation at 37 °C
with orbital shaking (250 rpm).

After incubation, 100 μL
of a 1:1 mixture of ethyl acetate/methanol was added to each well
with a multichannel pipet to quench the reaction. Additional 400 μL
of ethyl acetate and 200 μL of water were added to each well,
and mixing was achieved by pumping up and down with the pipettor 20
times over a few minutes. Plates were covered with polyester-based
sealing film and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature
to separate the two liquid layers. Aliquots (200 μL) of the
top liquid phase were removed from the plate and transferred to a
new 96-well plate (0.5 mL, Axygen Scientific, VWR International, cat.
no. 47743-982), the solvent was evaporated under a nitrogen stream
at room temperature, and samples were reconstituted in 100 μL
of the infusion solvent (80:20 methanol/water with 5 mM ammonium formate).
The plates were carefully sealed with aluminum foil and subjected
to flow injection tandem mass spectrometry on a Waters Xevo TQ instrument.
Autosampler and mass spectrometer settings are given in Supporting Information.

MPS-II assays were
carried out as above for MPS-I but with 1 mM
MPS-II substrate and 5 μM MPS-II internal standard. After incubation,
200 μL of 44 mM citric acid in water was added to each well
with a multichannel pipet to quench the reaction and to protonate
the carboxylate of the iduronic acid residue of the product to allow
extraction into organic solvent. Ethyl acetate (400 μL) and
water (100 μL) were added to each well, and samples were mixed
as above. Plates were additionally processed as for MPS-I.

MPS-VI
assays were carried out as above but with 1 mM MPS-VI substrate
and 5 μM MPS-VI internal standard. After incubation, two different
work-up protocols were used. In one variation the reaction was quenched
with 100 μL of 1:1 ethyl acetate/methanol. Additional 400 μL
of ethyl acetate and 100 μL of water were added to each well,
and plates were processed as for MPS-I assays. In the second variation,
quenching of incubated samples was with 100 μL of a suspension
of DEAE cellulose (Whatmann DE52 preswollen, 16 mg of resin per 100
μL of water) followed by 400 μL of ethyl acetate. The
samples were processed as above for the MPS-I assays.

Extraction
Studies
The various enzyme products (300
pmol) were dissolved in 30 μL of assay buffer to give 10 μM
analyte. The sample was processed by liquid–liquid extraction
as above and submitted to flow injection tandem mass spectrometry
as above. The amount of product detected by mass spectrometry was
compared to that measured when 300 pmol of enzymatic product was directly
injected into the instrument. The numbers were corrected for dilution
factors to obtain the percent of total product added to assay buffer
that was recovered in the organic phase.

Results and Discussion
Design
and Synthesis of Reagents
The synthesis of the
new MPS-I substrate, MPS-II substrate, and MS-VI substrate is shown
in Schemes 3 and 4.
The aglycones were synthesized by a common pathway (Scheme 3). Commercially available diamino alkanes were converted
to monobenzoylated species 1a,b by treatment
with methyl benzoate.28,29 The resulting primary amine underwent
a Michael addition with acrylamide 2, and the resulting
secondary amine was acylated with the appropriate acyl chloride to
give aglycones 3a–c in a one-pot
series of reactions. Purification steps were either recrystallization
or silica chromatography without the need for high-separation resolution.
These aglycones have been prepared on the 100 g scale.

Scheme 3 Scheme 4 MPS-I substrate was made by condensing aglycone 3b with protected iduronyl-F 4(5) to give 5b. Deacetylation afforded 6b,
and saponification afforded MPS-I substrate (Scheme 4). Aglycone 3b is the MPS-I product. MPS-I internal
standard was prepared using a route similar to that used for MPS-I
product but using commercially available and inexpensive pentadeuteriobenzoyl
chloride (Supporting Information). It is
chemically identical to MPS-I product but containing five deuteriums
in the benzoyl group.

MPS-II substrate was prepared from aglycone 3c (Scheme 3) by condensation with 4 (Scheme 4). After deacetylation, 6c was selectively
sulfated on the 2-OH group by formation of the dibutyl stannylene
acetal and treatment with SO3–Et3N as
described.30 Saponification of the methyl
ester afforded MPS-II substrate.

To prepare MPS-VI substrate,
aglycone 3a was condensed
with protected N-acetylgalactosamine-1-Cl 7 followed by deacetylation to give MPS-VI product. The latter was
selectively benzoylated on the 3- and 5-OH groups, the 4-OH was sulfated,
and debenzoylation afforded the MPS-VI substrate (Scheme 4).

All of these new reagents contain the same
bisamide unit found
in the Pompe reagent and should form the stable protonated species
shown in Scheme 2. The new reagents are also
easier to prepare than the original reagents owing to the lack of
the 7-hydroxycoumarin unit. MPS-II and MPS-VI substrates contain longer
acyl chains attached to the secondary amine of the aglycone compared
to MPS-I substrate. This is because, prior to tandem mass spectrometry,
assay mixtures are subjected to liquid–liquid extraction with
ethyl acetate to remove buffer salts that would interfere with the
electrospray ionization process. Since MPS-II and MPS-VI products
contain a monosaccharide, we used longer acyl groups to drive the
products into ethyl acetate. We measured the fraction of MPS-I, -II,
and -VI products that are extracted into ethyl acetate by submitting
the extracts to tandem mass spectrometry analysis compared to that
of a standard solution. Extraction yields were found to be 70%, 61%,
and 30% for MPS-I, -II, and -VI products, respectively. Incomplete
extraction is tolerated since the internal standards will be extracted
to the same extent as the corresponding products.

Tandem mass
spectrometry analysis of MPS-I, -II, and -VI products
show that all three give rise to a major fragment ion due to cleavage
pathway shown in Scheme 5. Cleavage of the
precursor ions along a major reaction pathway improves sensitivity
of product detection as formation of multiple product ions would decrease
the signal intensity since only a single ion reaction is monitored.

Scheme 5 Enzymatic Assays Using Dried Blood Spots
The new substrates
for MPS-I, MPS-II, and MPS-VI were tested side by side with our original
reagents (see the introduction) using a 3
mm punch of a dried blood spot from a single adult as the enzyme source.
After incubation, liquid–liquid extraction with ethyl acetate
was used to extract enzymatic product and internal standard into a
buffer salt-free, organic solvent phase since high salt interferes
with the electrospray ionization process in the mass spectrometer.
Internal standards, pentadeuterated versions of the products, were
used to convert the observed mass spectrometer signals into moles
of product formed. Use of a chemically identical internal standard
accounts for any losses of product due to many factors including absorption
of analytes onto surfaces, incomplete extraction into organic solvent,
consumption of products by downstream enzymes, and differential suppression
of ion formation in the electrospray ionization source of the mass
spectrometer.

Prior to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), it
is helpful to remove most of the substrate in the case of sulfatases
(MPS-II and -VI) since substrate-to-product conversion occurs to a
small extent in the electrospray ionization source (due to local heating
and possibly other factors). In the case of MPS-II, the reaction is
quenched with citric acid to protonate the carboxylate of the iduronic
acid group of the MPS-II product so that it is well-extracted into
ethyl acetate. Essentially all of the MPS-II substrate remains in
the aqueous layer since it bears a monoanionic sulfate ester that
remains deprotonated (the conjugate base of an acid whose pKa is <0). In the case of MPS-VI, ethyl acetate
extraction alone works to some extent to separate the charge-neutral
MPS-VI product from MPS-VI substrate bearing a sulfate monoanion,
but better results are obtained if the anion exchanger DEAE-cellulose
is added during ethyl acetate extraction to tightly trap the substrate
(see below). MPS-I substrate does not significantly fragment in the
electrospray ionization source, and it is not necessary to reduce
substrate amount prior to mass spectrometry. Also since the assay
is not acidifed prior to ethyl acetate extraction, most of MPS-I substrate
remains in the aqueous phase.

Original and new reagents were
used in side-by-side assays using
multiple punches form the same dried blood spot (obtained from a healthy
adult). Table 1 gives the observed ion counts
for MPS-I, MPS-II, and MPS-VI products. The signal for the MPS-I product
was 3.4-fold higher than that for an identical assay carried out with
the original MPS-I reagent (7-hydroxycoumarin type, see the introduction). The sensitivity improvement factor
for MPS-II product is 5.8. For MPS-VI, the assay gives a sensitivity
enhancement of 7.9- and 8.9-fold, compared to the original reagent,
if reaction quenching is with anion-exchange resin prior to liquid–liquid
extraction into ethyl acetate or ethyl acetate extraction alone, respectively.
These results support our hypothesis that enhanced protonation of
the gas-phase product ions via the bisamide unit of the new reagents
(Scheme 2) gives a larger ion count signal.

Table 1 Ion Counts in the Product Tandem Mass
Spectrometer Channels for the New versus Original Products
product	product ion counts (original reagent)	product ion counts (new reagent)	
MPS-I product	82951	282449	
MPS-II product	1240	7240	
MPS-VI product (ethyl acetate extraction only)	1304	10300	
MPS-VI product (quench with
anion exchanger then ethyl acetate extraction)	1263	11221	
Table 2 gives the specific activities of
the lysosomal enzymes for the original and new assay reagents. These
are expressed as micromoles of product per hour per liter of blood.
Internal standard ion counts are used to convert the observed product
ion counts to moles of products. Each 3 mm dried blood spot punch
contains the components of 3.3 μL of blood. We also carried
out control assays in which a 3 mm filter paper punch (no blood) was
included, and the sample was incubated and processed as for the complete
assay. For MPS-I, the specific activities with the original and new
reagents are similar, showing that both substrates are hydrolyzed
with similar catalytic efficiencies. In the absence of blood, the
new reagent gives a lower background signal compared to that from
the original reagent. This presumably reflects a combination of lower
amounts of new substrate extracted into ethyl acetate compared to
the original substrate and/or lower break down of new substrate in
the electrospray ionization source compared to the original substrate.
As a result the blood to no-blood assay response is 5.6 times higher
for the new versus original assay. For MPS-II, the specific activities
measured with the original and new substrates are similar, and the
blood to no-blood ratio is 2-fold higher with the new reagent. For
MSP-VI the new reagent is a better substrate, with a specific activity
that is about 8-fold higher than that with the original substrate.
When the anion exchanger is used in the reaction quench the blood
to no-blood ratio jumps from 4.9 to 97.4 when the original reagent
is replaced with the new reagent. With the new reagent, this ratio
is smaller, 16.7, when ethyl acetate extraction alone is used, suggesting
that removing more substrate from the organic extract by trapping
it on the anion-exchange resin leads to a decrease in background signal.
This in turn suggests that most of the background comes from substrate-to-product
conversion in the electrospray ionization source.

Table 3 gives the coefficient of variation
(CV, %) for three injections of an identical solution into the mass
spectrometer (intra-assay) or for three independent assays using three
punches from the same dried blood spot (interassay) for assays with
the original and new reagents. In all cases, CVs were <10%. These
numbers are generally consistent with CVs for other assays used in
newborn screening laboratories and illustrate the high reproducibility
of these assays.

a Intra-assay CV was calculated from

b Interasssay CV is calculated
from
three independent assays carried out with three different punches
of the same dried blood spot.

We measured the activities of the MPS-I, MPS-II, and MPS-VI enzymes
in dried blood spots from 15 random newborns and from an affected
child (diagnosis previously confirmed by standard methods). Figures 1–3 give a graphical description of the results, and all numerical values
are provided in Supporting Information Tables
1–3. For MPS-I, -II, and -VI, all normals are well-separated
from the affected patient. The ratio of mean normal activity to that
of the affected child is 40 for MPS-I, 32 for MPS-II, and 17 for MPS-VI.
The corresponding ratios obtained by digital microfluidic fluorescent
assays are 6.5 for MPS-I and 3.8 for MPS-II (no data for MPS-VI).31 The results show that the MS/MS assay greatly
outperforms the fluorescence assay in terms of difference in activity
between nonaffected and lysosomal storage disease-affected individuals.

Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Conclusions
The assay performance of the new reagents
for MPS-I, -II, and -VI
described in this study is superior to that obtained with our earlier
reported reagents for assay of lysosomal enzymes in dried blood spots.
The new reagents are easier to synthesize than the previous reagents
and have been made on the multigram scale appropriate to support worldwide
newborn screening. Enhanced product ion counts in the mass spectrometer
are especially important for sulfatases (MPS-II and -VI) since these
enzymes generate products containing a monosaccharide, which generally
ionize poorer in the electrospray source compared to products that
lack a carbohydrate group (i.e., MPS-I). The ratio of complete assay
to no-blood background assay response with the new reagents is superior
to those reported in all previously described assays of these three
lysosomal enzymes. This in turn should lead to a larger span in assay
responses when blood samples from healthy individuals are compared
to those from disease-affected newborns. These new MPS-I, -II, and
-VI reagents are currently being used in large-scale pilot studies
in newborn screening laboratories, and parameters including positive
predictive values and false positive rates will be reported upon completion
of these trials.
