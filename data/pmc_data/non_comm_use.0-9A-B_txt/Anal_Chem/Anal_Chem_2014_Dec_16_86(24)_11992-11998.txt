We
have developed a self-reporting isothermal system for visual
bacterial pathogen detection with single base resolution. The new
DNA diagnostic is based on combination of peptide nucleic acid (PNA)
technology, rolling circle amplification (RCA) and DNAzymes. PNAs
are used as exceedingly selective chemical tools that bind genomic
DNA at a predetermined sequence under nondenaturing conditions. After
assembly of the PNA-DNA construct a padlock probe is circularized
on the free strand. The probe incorporates a G-quadruplex structure
flanked by nicking enzyme recognition sites. The assembled circle
serves as a template for a novel hybrid RCA strategy that allows for
exponential amplification and production of short single-stranded
DNA pieces. These DNA fragments fold into G-quadruplex structures
and when complexed with hemin become functional DNAzymes. The catalytic
activity of each DNAzyme unit leads to colorimetric detection and
provides the second amplification step. The combination of PNA, RCA,
and DNAzymes allows for sequence-specific and highly sensitive detection
of bacteria with a colorimetric output observed with the naked eye.
Herein, we apply this method for the discrimination of Escherichia
coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Clostridium difficile genomes.

Sensitive and sequence-specific
DNA detection has become increasingly important in biological studies,
clinical diagnostics, and biodefense applications. Although low-cost
and field-ready PCR devices are being developed, the use of fluorescent
dyes and a thermo-cycling apparatus remains cost prohibitive in resource-poor
settings. Therefore, isothermal amplification techniques and fluorescent-free
detection methods are urgently required.1 Here, we report a pathogen diagnostic method that can be used to
visually discriminate bacterial genomic DNA under isothermal conditions.

The first step in our method is the sequence-specific recognition
of the target sites within the bacterial genome using peptide nucleic
acids. PNAs belong to a group of nucleic acid mimics that consist
of nucleobases attached to a polyamide backbone.2−4 Cationic pyrimidine
bis-PNAs can be used to sequence-specifically bind to one strand of
the DNA duplex, leaving the other strand free for probe hybridization.5 Two ends of a linear padlock probe are then ligated
on the displaced strand forming a PD-loop (see Figure 1).4,6,7 The ligation
reaction is extremely sequence specific and can discriminate single
mutations if they are located close to the ligation point. The PD-loop
formation is limited to the preselected 20–30-bp-long target
site within dsDNA and is normally unique in the entire genome.8−11 A significant advantage of PNA-based padlock probe design is that
the rest of the DNA retains its duplex structure and is inaccessible
for probe binding, which greatly reduces background noise. The assembled
circular probe serves as a template for rolling circle amplification.12

Our group has previously applied the combination
of PNAs, linear
RCA, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for bacterial identification
in clinical and environmental samples.9 RCA was performed in the presence of fluorescently labeled decorators
and the fluorescent product was detected by microscopy techniques.
In a follow-up study, this method was successfully used to detect Staphylococcus aureus and to discriminate between methicillin
sensitive (MSSA) and methicillin resistant (MRSA) strains.11 In both cases, a fluorescently labeled probe
and microscope were necessary to visualize the detection. In the present
Article, we employ the DNAzyme assay to make possible a visual detection
output. DNAzymes are nucleic acid structures that have the unique
ability to mimic the functions of enzymes and catalyze certain chemical
reactions.13−16 There are several advantages to using DNAzymes over traditional
protein enzymes; they are inexpensive, easy to prepare and modify,
and have high chemical and thermal stability.17

Previously, linear RCA has been employed to create a sequence
of
tethered G-quadruplexes to detect 1pM of a single-stranded analyte.18 The Willner group applied this method to identify
the M13 phage single-stranded DNA sequence.19 To the best of our knowledge, this approach has never been employed
for the detection of double-stranded bacterial DNA. Here, we report
the first successful workflow starting with actual genomic DNA to
visually detect bacterial pathogens under isothermal conditions.

Figure 1 Scheme
of the bacterial DNA detection method. (A) A pair of bis-PNA
openers binds to one strand of bacterial pathogen DNA, leaving the
other strand free for padlock probe hybridization. (B) PD-loop formation
is limited to the preselected 20–30 bp target site. (C) Hyperbranched
RCA allows for exponential signal amplification. (D) The product is
double-stranded, so a nicking enzyme is used to create a gap in one
of the strands and the nicked pieces are subsequently displaced by
primer extension. This process causes an accumulation of ss-DNA pieces
that fold into G-quadruplex structures.

Similar to the prior studies we designed our RCA product
to contain
G-rich tracts that fold into G-quadruplex domains. In order to increase
analytic sensitivity, we substituted linear RCA with hyperbranched
RCA (HRCA). Similar to PCR, double-primed HRCA allows for exponential
amplification of the target template. The reaction begins in the same
way as linear RCA, where a strand-displacing polymerase elongates
one primer to create a long, single-stranded product that contains
tandem repeats complementary to the circular probe. In HRCA, a reverse
primer is added to bind the complementary sequence. As the reverse
primers are elongated they generate displaced DNA strands, which in
turn initiate more priming events by the forward primer (Figure1C). As a result, exponential amplification is achieved.
Performed at 65 °C, HRCA produces about 106 more copies
of a specific circular template in a 90 min time frame compared to
linear RCA.20 The products of HRCA are
double-stranded repeats of the circular template with varying lengths.
However, a G-quadruplex can only fold from single-stranded DNA, so
an additional step is required to ensure that DNAzymes can form.

To exponentially generate single-stranded products, we developed
a novel hybrid HRCA technique by introducing a nicking enzyme into
the traditional system. The circular template is designed with three
recognition sites for a nicking enzyme, which cuts the complementary
strand with the G-rich tracts. Two G-tracts are encoded per circular
template, so the nicks in the complementary strand result in two DNAzymes
and one nonreactive DNA piece. During HRCA, multiple nicking events
create new starting points for replication. In contrast to traditional
HRCA that stops once all products become double-stranded, in our design
the amplification continuously restarts because the nicking enzyme
creates additional sites for strand displacement reactions. We called
the new signal amplification strategy exponential-linear RCA (ELRCA)
because exponential amplification and accumulation of short linear
DNA fragments is achieved. In our case, the nicking and displacement
reactions create short single-stranded G-rich sequences that fold
into G-quadruplex structures (Figure 1D). Upon
addition of hemin, these G-quadruplexes become functional DNAzymes
that can facilitate the oxidation of 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethyl-benzthiazoline)-6-sulfonic
acid (ABTS) by H2O2.21−23

Nicking
endonuclease-assisted RCA (NRCA) has attracted intense
interest lately because of its great detection capacity.24−27 Originally applied to molecular beacon systems, NRCA is an efficient
way to improve sensitivity in DNA detection. In typical NRCA design,
the nicking site is inserted in the circular template and yields many
copies of products by multiple nicking-displacement reactions. Also,
the group of Komiyama developed a primer generation-rolling circle
amplification (PG-RCA) technique. In these schemes, a nicking enzyme
is used with linear RCA (LRCA), so only primer extension and nicking
reactions, without branched strand displacement, are integrated.28

Our ELRCA design has the advantage of
exponential amplification
and the production of thousands of repeated sequences under isothermal
conditions with high efficiency and specificity. Here, we describe
this technology in detail and demonstrate its use for the detection
and discrimination of Escherichia coli, Clostridium
difficile, and Salmonella.

Experimental
Section
Bacterial Culture and Genomic DNA Preparation
In this
study, the following strains were used: Clostridium difficile strain 630 (BAA-1382, ATCC), Bacillus subtilis (AG174,
ATCC), Salmonella typhimurium LT2 (700720, ATCC), Escherichia coli (O157:H7) (700927, ATCC), and E.
coli K-12. They were cultured overnight at 37 °C in
LB medium. Genomic DNA was isolated using Sigma GenElute Bacterial
Genomic DNA Kit (NA2110) according to manufacturer’s protocol.
The DNA was precipitated with 100% ethanol and 3 M NaOAc, washed 5
times with 70% ethanol to remove excess salt, and resuspended in 10
mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.9).

PD-Loop Site Selection
The PD-loop sites were selected
using bacterial genome sequences available from the Genomes Database.
Signature sites with different linker sequences between PNA binding
sites were selected (Table 1). Specifically,
we searched for sites RkNnRl (where R is a purine
base and N is any base) choosing k and l between 7 and 8 and n between 2 and 10. PNA oligomers
used in the project were purchased from PANAGENE or were from the
laboratory collection. These PNAs recognize 6- to 10-bp-long sites
on DNA. All PD-loop sites were checked with BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/) to select those sites that are unique to the target pathogen.

PNA Invasion and Padlock
Probe Ligation
The bis-PNAs
used in this study are listed in Table 1. PNA
invasion was performed in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) with
2 μM of each PNA and a total volume of 25 μL. The mixture
was incubated at 45 °C for 4 h. Each ODN is designed so that
its RCA product can fold into a G-quadruplex structure. For ODN ligation,
the following reagents were added after PNA invasion: 0.5× T4
DNA Ligase buffer (obtained from New England Biolabs), 2.5 μM
of ODN, 1 mM ATP, and 10 units T4 DNA Ligase (obtained from New England
Biolabs). The ligation was performed for 2 h at 30 °C. The mixture
was then heated to 65 °C to deactivate the ligase.

DNAzyme Aptamer
Optimization
We tested four DNAzyme
structures PW17, PW17stem, PS5M (all intramolecular G-quadruplexes),
and Agro100 (intermolecular G-quadruplex). PW17 and PW17stem gave
us the highest detection signal (Supporting Information Figure S1), so we used PW17 in all subsequent experiments.

Linear
RCA (LRCA)
Linear RCA was performed in a 20
μL solution that contained the target circular template, 1×
Phi29 DNA polymerase buffer, 1 mM dNTP mix, 0.2 mg/mL purified BSA,
1 μM primer, and 5 units of Phi29 DNA polymerase. The reaction
mixture was incubated at 37 °C for eight different time points:
0, 10, 30, 90, 180, 240, 300, and 360 min.

Exponential Linear Rolling
Circle Amplification (ELRCA)
The ELRCA reaction was prepared
by combining the target circular
DNA with 8 units of Bst2.0 DNA Polymerase (obtained from New England
Biolabs), 1× Isothermal Amplification Buffer (obtained from New
England Biolabs), 1 mM dNTPs, 1 μM of each primer. Amplification
was initiated by heating this mixture to 65 °C. After 5 min of
RCA, 10 units of Nb.BsrDI were added to the reaction. This mixture
was incubated at 65 °C for 4 h.

Colorimetric Detection
To form DNAzyme units 20 μL
of the amplification product was combined with an equal volume of
1 μM hemin in the following buffer: 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 20 mM MgCl2, and 0.05% Triton X-100. The mixture was incubated at room
temperature for 1 h and transferred to a microplate. ABTS was dissolved
in 0.05 M phosphate-citrate buffer at 1 mg/mL, pH 5.0, and 160 μL
of this mixture was added to the amplicon and hemin. The DNAzyme units
facilitate the oxidation of ABTS, the product of which is green. This
causes a color change of the reaction solution and the detection output
was quantified by absorbance measurements at 412 nm using SpectraMax
M5 spectrophotometer.

Time Dependence Assay
A synthetic
target template was
used to ligate the ODN probe and evaluate ELRCA time dependence. The
ELRCA reaction was performed with 100pM of the circular template,
8 units of Bst2.0 DNA Polymerase (obtained from New England Biolabs),
1× Isothermal Amplification Buffer (obtained from New England
Biolabs), 1 mM dNTPs, and 1 μM of each primer.

Limit of Detection
Assay
A synthetic target template
was used to ligate the ODN probe and evaluate the limit of detection.
The circular template was serially diluted to concentrations ranging
from 100pM down to 1fM. Exponential linear RCA was performed as previously
described for 4 h. The nonligated ODN probe was used as a negative
control. After incubation with hemin and addition of ABTS the absorbance
of the reaction solution was measured every 30 s for a total of 30
min.

Results and Discussion
Selection of Nicking Endonuclease
Several nicking endonuclease
were evaluated for this detection method (see Supporting Information Figure S2 and Table S1). The nicking
enzyme Nb.BsrDI was selected because it displayed the highest signal-to-noise
ratio. We designed our padlock probe to contain three Nb.BsrDI recognition
sites in order to create two DNAzymes per circle. Nb.BsrDI creates
single-stranded nicks on the double-stranded product between DNAzyme
units that are simultaneously displaced by DNA polymerase. The nicking
step separates the G-quadruplex domains and facilitates proper DNAzyme
folding.

LRCA versus ELRCA Reaction Kinetics
Since the amplification
efficiency is the most important characteristic, we compared ELRCA
reaction kinetics with those of linear RCA over a 6 h time course.
Figure 2A shows the development of colorimetric
signal over time for both amplification methods. Certainly, the result
of this analysis may not reflect actual amplification efficiency,
since only properly folded DNAzymes yield the color-changing output
(quantified by absorbance). Nevertheless, we observed an exponential
increase of absorbance with respect to ELRCA time course. As expected,
linear RCA demonstrates a linear increase in absorbance over time.

ELRCA Optimization
We tested several ELRCA time spans
ranging from 10 min to 16 h and found that the detection signal increases
significantly up to 4 h of ELRCA (Figure 2B).
The difference in detection signal between 4 and 16 h of ELRCA was
not significant, which suggests that the buildup of product does eventually
cause signal saturation. That could be explained by multiple reasons,
one of which is improper DNA product folding. With time, the single-stranded
DNA amplification products get longer and formation of random structures
becomes more likely. It is also possible that the breakdown of H2O2, as well as ABTS during the oxidation reaction
may contribute to slowing down the reaction after 4 h of RCA. Finally,
all amplification reactions have a tendency to reach a plateau phase
because of substrate depletion, production inhibition or loss of enzyme
activity. In our case, a consequence of such an extensive amplification
is the production of high amounts of ssDNA and pyrophosphate. These
two factors are known to inhibit polymerases. As a result, we concluded
that the optimal amplification time is between 30 and 240 min.

Since there are two enzymes involved in this system we evaluated
several time-delays for the addition of Nb.BsrDI after the start of
amplification (ranging from 0 min to 3 h). We found that adding the
nicking enzyme 5 min after initiation of RCA gave us a significantly
higher detection signal compared with the other settings (see Supporting Information Figure S3). Under these
optimized conditions we performed serial dilution experiments to determine
the limit of detection (LOD) of our assay. We were able to differentiate
as little as 1fM target DNA concentration from our negative control
(nonligated circle) (Figure 2C). With a sample
volume of 200 μL this corresponds to the detection of about
105 pathogen molecules, which is within the expected number
of organisms/mL (103 to 109) in stool samples
of patients with enteric infections.29−32 For in-field conditions, a phone
or digital camera can be used for unbiased detection. This analytical
sensitivity provides a reasonable basis to begin optimization for
clinical diagnostics.

Figure 2 (A) Comparison of detection kinetics using exponential-linear
RCA
versus linear RCA with 10pM target concentration. (B) Hyperbranched
RCA time dependence. Several hRCA durations were compared in order
to select the optimum duration for our detection protocol. The two
negative controls, nonligated RCA probe (NL) and hemin alone, represent
the background noise in our detection. Although the detection output
(measured in absorbance at 412 nm) increased with RCA duration, we
found that there was a limited increase in detection signal after
4 h of RCA. (C) hRCA LOD. The LOD was determined by measuring the
detection output with different starting concentrations of target
DNA (100, 10, and 1 fM). Nonligated RCA probe (NL) was used to measure
the background noise.

Sequence Selectivity
We validated our method by applying
it to the detection of clinically relevant pathogens. Our previous
studies provided strong evidence that the PD-loop design has a single-base
selectivity.11,33,34 We first tested the sequence-specificity of this method on the target
site within the RNA polymerase gene that differs between Escherichia
coli and Bacillus subtillis genomes by only
2 nucleotides. We performed the entire assay on E. coli and B. subtilis genomic DNA using this target site.
Figure 3A shows the structure of the PNA–DNA
complex that allows ligation of the padlock. Because of the stringent
strand-matching requirement for the ligation of the padlock probe,
the mismatch in B. subtilis prohibits the PD-loop
formation and RCA amplification. To determine the background noise
from genomic DNA we performed the entire detection on E. coli DNA without adding PNAs. Without PNA invasion, bacterial DNA remains
in its duplex form and all subsequent steps are prevented.

Figure 3 Detection of
bacterial genomic DNA. The optimized method was used
to detect genomic DNA of E. coli, S. typhimurium, and C. difficile. (A, B) E. coli DNA is discriminated from B. subtilis DNA based
on 2 mismatches in the target sequence. (C, D) S. typhimurium-specific (C) and C. difficile-specific (D) probes
were applied to three bacteria: S. typhimurium, C. difficile, and E. coli. Data represent mean ±1 standard
deviation from at least three experiments (*p <
0.005).

We successfully discriminated E. coli from B. subtillis, confirming the
high sequence-specificity of
our assay (Figure 3B). Next, we performed the
discrimination of various bacteria using reference strains of enteric
pathogens. We chose pathogen-specific target sites located in the
following genes: FKBP isomerase for Salmonella typhimurium and flagellar export protein for Clostridium difficile (Table 1). When detecting S. typhimurium we found that we were able to detect as little as 100fM target DNA
concentration (Figure 3C), while detection
of C. difficile was achieved down to 10fM concentrations
(Figure 3D). The difference in LOD for different
target species is likely due to the quality of the purified DNA.

While DNA recovery from stool samples is known to be less that
100% efficient many groups have shown that various commercially available
DNA purification kits work well for obtaining DNA from stool samples
for PCR-based detection.35,36 Therefore, we are confident
that the DNA extraction efficiency of commercial kits is sufficient
for our assay.

Sensitivity and Specificity
Finally,
to determine the
sensitivity and specificity of this assay we conducted experimenter-blinded
tests using 35 deidentified, codified samples contained E.
coli 0157:H7 and S. typhimurium LT2 (15 of each), as well as 5 samples with human genomic DNA that
were negative for bacteria. Each sample was tested with probes specific
for E. coli (E), S. typhimurium (S), and Shigella flexneri (H). The fraction of
bacteria that were correctly/incorrectly identified as well as three
representative results are shown in Table 2.

To determine the cutoff for positive pathogen identification the
background intensity was measured from human genomic DNA in the presence
of nonligated circle. From these measurements, a cutoff for positive
identification was defined as the average of the negative control
plus three negative control standard deviations (dashed line at 0.59
in Table 2). We were able to correctly identify
13/15 samples with E. coli 0157:H7 and 14/15 samples
with S. typhimurium. Two of the E. coli samples were incorrectly identified as S. typhimurium, and one S. typhimurium sample was identified as E. coli. From these experiments,
we were able to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of our detection
method, 87%/93% for pathogenic E. coli and 93%/90%
for Salmonella, which are comparable to the currently
used PCR-luminex assay.31

Conclusion
The detection of ultralow concentrations of nucleic acids such
as microRNAs, pathogenic DNAs, and mutations in cancer requires high
levels of amplification. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification technologies
offer significant advantages over PCR because they do not require
thermal cycling or sophisticated laboratory equipment. Here, we describe
the diagnostic method that can discriminate bacterial pathogens with
single-base sequence specificity. PNA openers are inherently less
prone to inhibition compounds in clinical samples, so we expect that
our approach will not require a complicated DNA purification protocol
and can be directly applied to cell lysate. The entire detection is
performed under isothermal conditions and provides a colorimetric
output, which minimizes the need for instrumentation. The exponential
nature of ELRCA shows high amplification efficiency without sacrificing
the specificity. The limit of detection is suitable for point-of-care
diagnostics of enteric infections, so the approach can be applied
for the development of a user-friendly diagnostic of bacterial pathogens
in resource-limited areas. In conclusion we would like to emphasize
that we have developed a new generation of RCA with single-stranded
final product, which means that it is readily available for sensitive
and real-time fluorescent detection.
