Engagement
of the B cell receptor for antigen (BCR) leads to immune
responses through a cascade of intracellular signaling events. Most
studies to date have focused on the BCR and protein tyrosine phosphorylation.
Because spleen tyrosine kinase, Syk, is an upstream kinase in multiple
BCR-regulated signaling pathways, it also affects many downstream
events that are modulated through the phosphorylation of proteins
on serine and threonine residues. Here, we report a novel phosphopeptide
enrichment strategy and its application to a comprehensive quantitative
phosphoproteomics analysis of Syk-dependent downstream signaling events
in B cells, focusing on serine and threonine phosphorylation. Using
a combination of the Syk inhibitor piceatannol, SILAC quantification,
peptide fractionation, and complementary PolyMAC-Ti and PolyMAC-Zr
enrichment techniques, we analyzed changes in BCR-stimulated protein
phosphorylation that were dependent on the activity of Syk. We identified
and quantified over 13 000 unique phosphopeptides, with a large
percentage dependent on Syk activity in BCR-stimulated B cells. Our
results not only confirmed many known functions of Syk, but more importantly,
suggested many novel roles, including in the ubiquitin proteasome
pathway, that warrant further exploration.

==== Body
B cells are
a vital component
of the adaptive immune system that recognize foreign antigens through
a cell surface immunoglobulin known as the B cell receptor (BCR) for
antigen.1 B cell activation through BCR
stimulation results in proliferation and differentiation of B cells
to form both antibody-producing and memory cells. Cross-linking the
BCR by antigen engagement initiates phosphorylation of immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) by the Src-family kinase,
Lyn, and subsequent recruitment of the tyrosine kinase, Syk. Multiple
adaptor proteins and effector proteins, including the B cell linker
protein BLNK, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav, phospholipase
C-γ (PLCγ), and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K),
associate to form signaling complexes2 that
trigger downstream pathways such as activation of Btk, mobilization
of Ca2+,3 and activation of
the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway. The interaction between a phosphorylated
ITAM and the SH2 domains of Syk, coupled with the phosphorylation
of the kinase on tyrosine, is essentially required for all BCR-mediated
signaling events.

The contribution of Syk to the adaptive immune
response in B cells
is well-known and characterized. However, studies have also identified
a large number of diverse biological functions for Syk, including
cellular adhesion, phagocytosis, osteoclast maturation, platelet activation,
and vascular development.2 The involvement
of Syk in the pathogenesis of allergy, autoimmune diseases, carcinoma
and hematological malignancies has made it an important therapeutic
target.2,4−6 Thus, knowledge of the
downstream pathways that mediate the diverse functions of Syk are
of considerable interest. Because Syk is a tyrosine kinase, most studies
have focused on Syk-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation,7 which is largely limited to immediate downstream
signaling events and direct substrates.8 Since Syk functions upstream of multiple pathways of which serine/threonine
kinases (e.g., PKC, Erk, Akt, etc.) are major components, changes
in its activity would be expected to affect many downstream events
regulated by protein phosphorylation on serines and threonines. This
study was designed to identify Syk-dependent downstream pathways in
activated B cells at the proteomics level, focusing mainly on such
serine and threonine phosphorylation events.

Mass spectrometry
is the major tool for analyzing protein phosphorylation
in a high-throughput manner. Phosphopeptide enrichment is a necessary
prerequisite in phosphoproteomics as a result of the low stoichiometry
of protein phosphorylation and the low abundance of phosphoproteins.9,10 Many different approaches have been employed for phosphopeptide
enrichment11 and can be categorized mainly
under affinity purification,10,12−20 chemical derivatization,21,22 and chromatographic
separation.23−25 The most popular enrichment approaches, immobilized
metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC)13−16 and metal oxide affinity chromatography
(MOAC),17−20 chelate phosphopeptides to an affinity group mounted on a solid
support. This heterogeneous condition can lead to poor binding accessibility
and low reproducibility.

Recently, we introduced polymer-based
metal ion affinity capture
(PolyMAC), a soluble reagent based on a titanium(IV)-functionalized
PAMAM dendrimer, which demonstrated enhanced reproducibility and selectivity.26 Other studies have shown the effectiveness of
using both Zr- and Ti-based reagents for phosphopeptide enrichment,
as well as the ability of each to capture a unique set of phosphopeptides.27 Therefore, to complement our titanium-bound
nanopolymer, we developed PolyMAC-Zr, a zirconium(IV)-functionalized
PAMAM G4 dendrimer. Here, we present PolyMAC-Zr as a novel reagent
for phosphopeptide enrichment and utilize the complementary PolyMAC-Ti
and PolyMAC-Zr enrichment methods to examine the role of Syk-dependent
phosphorylation in BCR signaling. Quantitative phosphoproteomics based
on stable isotope labeling via amino acid in culture (SILAC)28 was employed to identify downstream effectors
of Syk. Using the Syk substrate-site inhibitor piceatannol7 and comprehensive sample fractionation with reversed-phase
liquid chromatography (RPLC) or hydrophilic interaction chromatography
(HILIC), we were able to quantify close to 5000 sites of phosphorylation
that were significantly affected by the activity of Syk after BCR
stimulation from over 16 000 identified unique phosphorylation
sites. Functional and pathway annotations confirmed many known functions
of Syk, but also revealed potential novel roles, including a role
in modulating changes in protein ubiquitination.

Methods
Synthesis of
PolyMAC-Zr Reagent
Polyamidoamine dendrimer
generation 4 (PAMAM G4) solution (200 μL; provided as 10% w/v
in methanol; Sigma-Aldrich) was dried and redissolved in 1 mL of dimethyl
sulfoxide, then 6 mg of Boc-aminooxyacetic acid, 15 mg of N-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), and 10 μL of N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC)
were added and reacted overnight. The mixture was transferred to a
10 mL round-bottom flask, and an equal volume of 250 mM MES (2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; pH 5.5) buffer was added
to it. Next, 16 mg of carboxyethylphosphonic acid, 16 mg of N-hydroxysuccinimide, and 160 mg EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)carbodiimide
hydrochloride) were added to the mixture and stirred overnight. The
solution was dialyzed against water, reacted with 0.1 M ZrOCl2 for 90 min, and evaporated to complete dryness. The solid
was redissolved in 80% trifluoroacetic acid and reacted for 90 min.
The mixture was dialyzed successively against a 1:4 DMSO/water mixture
and water. The final PolyMAC-Zr product was stored at 4 °C.

Phosphopeptide Enrichment
Preparation of phosphopeptide
samples from DG-75 B cells and PolyMAC-Ti enrichment were carried
out in a similar fashion, as described before.26 For PolyMAC-Zr, the peptide mixture was dissolved in 100
μL of the loading buffer (200 mM glycolic acid, 1% trifluoroacetic
acid, and 50% acetonitrile); 5 nmol of PolyMAC-Zr was added to it
and incubated for 10 min. Then 250 μL of capture buffer (300
mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.7) was added to increase the pH above 6.3,
and the mixture was transferred to a spin column (Boca Scientific)
containing 50 μL of Carbolink coupling agarose gel (Thermo Scientific).
The samples were incubated for 10 min and centrifuged. The gel was
washed with loading buffer, washing buffer (100 mM acetic acid, 1%
trifluoroacetic acid, 80% acetonitrile), and water, then the phosphopeptides
were eluted with 400 mM ammonium hydroxide.

Growing DG75 Cells in SILAC
“Heavy” and “Light”
Media
For SILAC experiments, cells were grown to 50% confluency
in SILAC RPMI-1640 media (Gibco) substituted with 10% dialyzed inactivated
FBS (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% sodium pyruvate, 0.5% streptomycin/penicillin,
0.05% 2-mercaptoethanol, and either l-lysine and l-arginine for “light” samples or 13C6-l-arginine and 13C6-l-lysine (Isotec) for “heavy” samples in 5% CO2 at 37 °C.

Piceatannol Treatment and IgM Pathway Stimulation
The
cell cultures were plated at a density of 2 × 107 cells/mL
and treated with piceatannol at a concentration of 50 μg/mL.
Then the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The B cell
receptor signaling pathway was stimulated by treating the cells with
the anti-IgM antibody at a concentration of 10 μg/mL and incubated
at 4 °C for 15 min. The cells were lysed, and the protein components
were extracted and equally divided into three portions to carry out
the rest of the procedure as a single experiment.

Sample Fractionation
and Phosphopeptide Enrichment
Samples of “heavy”
and “light” labeled
whole cell extracts (2.5 mg each) were normalized, mixed, and digested
with trypsin. The peptide sample was injected into an Agilent 1100
HPLC system and separated using either a 4.6 mm × 150 mm XBridge
BEH C18, 3.5 μm particle reversed-phase liquid chromatography
(RPLC) column (Waters) or a 4.6 mm × 200 mm Polyhydroxyethyl
A, 5 μm particle hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC)
column (PolyLC Inc.). For the HILIC fractionation, the 5 mg peptide
sample was dissolved in 2 mL of solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile),
and the sample was injected in 90% solvent B at a flow rate of 0.1
mL/min. Solvent A consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water. After loading
the sample, the column was washed with 90% solvent B for 15 min at
0.5 mL/min flow rate. Peptides were eluted in an 85% B to 65% B gradient
for 40 min, followed by 65% B to 20% B gradient for 20 min at the
same flow rate. For the RPLC fractionation, the 5 mg peptide sample
was dissolved in 4 mL of solvent A (10 mM TMAB in water, pH 8), and
the sample was injected in 98% solvent A at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min.
After loading the sample, the column was washed with 98% solvent A
for 10 min at a 1 mL/min flow rate. Peptides were eluted over 98%
A to 60% A gradient for 60 min at 0.5 mL/min flow rate (solvent B
used for elution was 10 mM TMAB in acetonitrile, pH 8). For each separation,
20 fractions were collected. For the two sets of RPLC fractions, phosphopeptide
enrichment was carried out with PolyMAC-Zr and PolyMAC-Ti, whereas
the phosphopeptides in HILIC fractions were enriched only with PolyMAC-Zr.

LTQ-Orbitrap Analysis
Peptide samples were redissolved
in 10 μL of 0.25% formic acid and injected into the Eksigent
nano LC Ultra 2D system. The reversed-phase C18 was performed using
an in-house C-18 capillary column packed with 5 μm C18 Magic
bead resin (Michrom; 75 μm i.d. and 12 cm of bed length). The
mobile phase buffer consisted of 0.1% formic acid in ultrapure water
with an elution buffer of 0.1% formic acid in 100% CH3CN
run over a shallow linear gradient (from 2% CH3CN to 35%
CH3CN) over 90 min with a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The
electrospray ionization emitter tip was generated on the packed column
with a laser puller (model P-2000, Sutter Instrument Co.). The Eksigent
Ultra 2D HPLC system was coupled with a hybrid linear ion trap Orbitrap
mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap Velos; Thermo Fisher). The mass spectrometer
was operated in the data-dependent mode in which a full scan MS (from m/z 300 to 1700 with a resolution of 30 000
at m/z 400) was followed by 20 MS/MS
scans (for SILAC samples, 7 MS/MS scans were used) of the most abundant
ions. Ions with a charge state of +1 or undetermined charge states
were excluded. The mass exclusion time was 90 s.

Database Search
The LTQ-Orbitrap raw files were searched
directly against a human database using SEQUEST or MASCOT on Proteome
Discoverer (version 1.3, Thermo Fisher). Proteome Discoverer created
DTA files from raw data files with minimum ion threshold 15 and absolute
intensity threshold 50. The peptide precursor mass tolerance was set
to 10 ppm, and the MS/MS tolerance was set to 0.8 Da. Search criteria
included a static modification of cysteine residues of +57.0214 Da
and a variable modification of +15.9949 Da to include potential oxidation
of methionine and a modification of +79.996 Da on serine, threonine,
or tyrosine for the identification of phosphorylation. Searches were
performed with full tryptic digestion and allowed a maximum of two
missed cleavages on the peptides analyzed from the sequence database.
False discovery rates (FDR) were set to 1% for each analysis. The
number of unique phosphopeptides and nonphosphopeptides identified
were then counted using an in-house software. Phosphorylation site
localization from CID spectra was determined by PhosphoRS on Proteome
Discoverer 1.3. For SILAC experiments, in addition to the above parameters,
a dynamic modification of +6.020 Da was added on arginine and lysine.
The quantification method was set to SILAC 2plex (Arg6, Lys6) and
light/heavy ratios were reported.

Data Analysis
Unique peptides were extracted on the
basis of the m/z value and the charge
state using an in-house software. The actual phosphorylation sites
were determined by the PhosphoRS score, and only the top scoring phosphorylation
site was reported for any phosphopeptide with potentially ambiguous
sites. Following the standard SILAC quantification approach,10 the cutoff values for phosphorylation changes
were determined and above or below 2-times the standard deviation
from the mean was considered as a significant change. To predict upstream
kinases for identified phosphosites, in-house software utilizing the
kinase motifs listed on human protein reference database was used.

Pathway Analysis
A list of proteins was extracted corresponding
to the peptides selected above. This list with decreased and increased
phosphorylation and the corresponding SILAC ratios were submitted
to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Ingenuity Systems). The IPA criteria
were set to include only known human cellular proteins and their direct
interactions. In addition, protein functions were predicted using
DAVID bioinformatics tool.

Results and Discussion
PolyMAC-Zr
for Phosphopeptide Enrichment
We introduced
recently PolyMAC-Ti for efficient capturing of phosphopeptides.26 In addition to titanium, zirconium is capable
of effectively binding to phosphate groups, and this property has
been successfully explored for both phosphopeptide enrichment19,29 and DNA capturing30,31 using solid supports. To further
explore the utilization of zirconium ion for phosphopeptide enrichment,
we developed a soluble nanopolymer-based reagent, PolyMAC-Zr (Figure 1a), polyamidoamine (PAMAM) generation 4 dendrimer
functionalized with Zr4+ ions. Hydroxylamine groups were
attached to the dendrimer, which were used as the “handle”
to capture the dendrimer onto aldehyde-functionalized agarose beads
through a rapid covalent reaction. During phosphopeptide enrichment,
a complex peptide mixture is incubated with the PolyMAC-Zr reagent
in solution, resulting in the rapid and selective binding of phosphopeptides
in the homogeneous solution. The phophopeptide-bound PolyMAC-Zr reagent
is then isolated using the aldehyde-functionalized beads. Last, the
bound phosphopeptides are eluted under basic conditions for mass spectrometric
analysis. The capability of the reagent to effectively enrich phosphopeptides
was first evaluated using a simple mixture containing angiotensin
II and phosphorylated angiotensin II (Supporting
Information (SI) Figure S1) and then with a panel of peptides
generated from phosphorylated (α-casein, β-casein, and
ovalbumin) and unphosphorylated proteins (lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin,
catalase, hemoglobin, and bovine serum albumin). Before enrichment,
the majority of peaks detected by MALDI-TOF analysis were nonphosphopeptides.
After the enrichment, only phosphopeptides were observed (SI Figure S2).

To evaluate the performance of the new reagent
for use in a complex
mixture, we further tested it with a whole-cell lysate generated from
the human Burkitt’s lymphoma B cell line, DG75. A 100 μg
sample of the cell lysate was digested with trypsin and subjected
to phosphopeptide enrichment by PolyMAC-Zr. Among the various tested
loading buffer conditions, a solution consisting of 200 mM glycolic
acid, 50% acetonitrile, and 1% trifluoroacetic acid was optimal for
high selectivity and recovery (data not shown). The PolyMAC-Zr reagent
captured over 1200 unique phosphopeptides from 100 μg of DG75
cell lysate with over 60% selectivity for phosphorylated peptides
(Figure 1b,c). The overlap of identified phosphopeptides
between any two experiments was ∼75%, demonstrating the excellent
reproducibility of homogeneous capture with PolyMAC-Zr (Figure 1d), consistent with previous studies with PolyMAC-Ti.26 On the other hand, the overlap of phosphopeptides
enriched by PolyMAC-Zr and PolyMAC-Ti was <50% (Figure 1d), indicating each metal ion enriched a unique
set of phosphopeptides.

In-Depth Analyses of Syk-Dependent Phosphorylation
in B Cells
PolyMAC-Zr was used in combination with PolyMAC-Ti
to investigate
Syk-dependent phosphorylation in B cells following anti-IgM stimulation
of the BCR. Two populations of DG75 cells were grown in SILAC media
containing either “light” or “heavy” (13C6-labeled) arginine and lysine. One group of
cells was treated with the Syk inhibitor, piceatannol, and the other
group was treated with DMSO as a control. Both sets were stimulated
with anti-IgM antibody to activate the BCR signaling pathway. Equal
amounts of protein (2.5 mg) extracted from each cell population were
mixed and digested with trypsin.

To reduce the sample complexity,
we used RPLC32 or HILIC25 in the first dimension of peptide fractionation. HILIC
and RPLC are complementary separation methods,25,33 and we used PolyMAC-Zr to enrich phosphopeptides after HILIC fractions.
The orthogonality of RPLC was achieved by separating peptides at high
(pH 8) and low pH (pH 2.6) values in the two dimensions.32,34 Previously, this has been successfully applied for both phosphopeptide
and nonphosphopeptide separations.32,34,35 Each RPLC fraction was enriched for phosphopeptides
using PolyMAC-Zr or PolyMAC-Ti before the LC–MS/MS analysis.
Figure 2 summarizes the total number of phosphopeptides,
the number of unique phosphopeptides obtained from each fractionation
approach, and the distribution of phosphopeptides in different fractions.
As expected, the unique phosphopeptides identified using PolyMAC-Zr
versus PolyMAC-Ti demonstrated only about 50% overlap. A total of
13 029 unique phosphopeptides representing over 16 000
unique phosphorylation sites were identified in this study. The distribution
of serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphosites is illustrated in
Figure 2c. The relative abundances of 0.05%,
10%, and 90% have been reported for phosphotyrosine, phosphothreonine,
and phosphoserine, respectively. Here, we identified 437 (2.6%) phosphotyrosine,
2447 (15.1%) phosphothreonine, and 13304 (82.2%) phosphoserine sites.
The relative abundances are close to expected values for phosphothreonine
and phosphoserine but significantly higher for phosphotyrosine. Such
differences have been reported in previous studies that utilized extensive
fractionation to enable identification of low-abundance proteins that
are usually phosphorylated on tyrosine residues.10 We compared quantitatively the “light” to
“heavy” ratios of identified phosphopeptides between
the piceatannol-treated and untreated samples to assess the importance
of Syk to BCR-stimulated phosphorylation. Out of 13 029 unique
phosphopeptides, 1506 showed more than a 2-fold increase, whereas
2340 showed more than a 2-fold decrease after treatment with the inhibitor.
These unique phosphopeptides provided a list of 1982 phosphorylation
sites with increased phosphorylation from 1049 proteins and 2960 sites
with decreased phosphorylation levels from 1446 proteins (SI Tables S1 and S2).

RPLC and HILIC fractions both enriched with PolyMAC-Zr. (c) The pie

Regulation of Cellular Functions by Syk-Dependent Phosphorylation
In the presence of an antigen, B cell receptor (BCR) aggregates
and transduces signals to the cell interior by activating Src-family
kinases Lyn, Blk, and Fyn, as well as tyrosine kinases Syk and BTK.
These participate in signaling complexes that include adaptor proteins,
such as CD19 and BLNK, and signaling effectors, such as PLCγ,
PI3K, and VAV. Signals transduced through these components activate
multiple downstream signaling cascades, inducing changes in cellular
metabolism, gene expression, and cytoskeletal organization. These
signaling cascades can regulate survival, tolerance, proliferation,
or differentiation of B cells.2,36,37 Therefore, it is important to understand the Syk-dependent processes
of these complicated signaling events. Elucidation of these processes
can be facilitated by examining signaling events with and without
the inhibition of Syk using piceatannol. Proteins directly involved
in these pathways typically demonstrate decreased levels of phosphorylation
upon Syk inhibition. However, feedback loops and lack of activation
of phosphatases may result in increased levels of phosphorylation
in some proteins.36−38

To further understand the Syk-dependent changes
in phosphorylation, the nature of upstream kinases were predicted
on the basis of the sequences of phosphorylation sites using software
developed in-house, as shown in Figure 3a.
A list of kinase motifs was extracted from the human protein reference
database (HPRD),39 and upstream kinases
were predicted for all the phosphorylation sites identified with changing
phosphorylation levels. The normalized fraction of phosphorylation
sites for each kinase is illustrated in Figure 3a, where a positive value indicates the fraction of phosphorylation
sites with increased phosphorylation and a negative value indicates
the fraction of phosphorylation sites with decreased phosphorylation
upon treatment with piceatannol. According to the above analysis,
calmodulin-dependent kinase motifs are found only among the sites
with decreased phosphorylation. Intracellular calcium levels increase
during BCR signaling1 and Syk inhibition
interrupts proper signal propagation,40 which may lead to the decreased activity of calcium-dependent kinases.
AKT and NIMA kinase motifs are represented only among sites with increased
phosphorylation. AKT is activated downstream of BCR engagement in
B cells; therefore, a decrease in AKT activity is expected upon Syk
inhibition. However, this observed increase in phosphorylation could
be due to the fact that most cultured lymphoid cell lines, including
DG75, lack both PTEN and SHIP1 and have constitutively active AKT.41−43 Furthermore, there are significantly higher numbers of CDC-like
kinase 1 (CLK1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) sites with
decreased phosphorylation. AMPK is known to be activated downstream
of the T cell receptor (TCR) in a manner dependent on CaMKKs and the
Zap-70 substrates LAT and SLP76.44 CLK1
is a dual specificity kinase expressed in the nucleus that is involved
in mRNA splicing.45 Serine/arginine rich
proteins are known substrates for this kinase,46 and several such proteins show decreased phosphorylation
levels in our study. Interestingly, we identified RNA post-transcriptional
modifications pathway as one of the perturbed networks upon Syk inhibition
(Figure 3b, SI Figure
S3 and Table S3). Specifically, mRNA spicing factors, ribonuclear
proteins and splicing regulatory proteins show significant changes
in levels of phosphorylation.

Figure 3 Regulation of cellular functions by Syk dependent
phosphorylation.
(a) Distribution of consensus kinase motifs within the data set. (b)
A summary of B cell functions perturbed by Syk inhibition.

Interestingly, Src-family kinases, polo-like kinase
1(PLK1), and
ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM) substrate sites are enriched
among sites with increased phosphorylation. Syk and Src family kinases
are known to participate in signaling cross-talk47 and may have nonredundant48 or
opposing49 roles in some pathways. Therefore,
Syk inhibition may have affected cross talk between Syk and Src kinases,
resulting in increased levels of Src family kinase-dependent phosphorylation.
PLK1, on the other hand, functions in centrosome maturation, spindle
assembly and cytokinesis. Prior experiments have revealed autophosphorylation-dependent
centrosomal localization of Syk4,6,50 and colocalization of Syk and PLK1 at mitotic spindle poles.51 Threonine phosphorylation on Syk by PLK1 has
been reported to be a part of an antiapoptotic mechanism, and the
disruption of the mechanism may have activated alternative PLK1-dependent
phosphorylation events.51 Furthermore,
we have identified centrosome organization as one of the functions
perturbed upon Syk inhibition (Figure 3b, SI Figure S4 and Table S4)

A limitation
in upstream kinase prediction is the lack of known
consensus sequences for the majority of kinases, and therefore the
study was restricted to a few kinases. Furthermore, the substrate
specificities of many kinases overlap, making it difficult to attribute
specific phosphorylation events to a single kinase. Still, some of
the kinase motifs show significant enrichment among groups of sites
with distinctive higher or lower phosphorylation levels. On the other
hand, functional annotation provides complementary information that
can be correlated with phosphorylation changes of kinase specific
sites. For example, we have identified NPM1, NUDC, and BUB1B which
are PLK1 substrates during centrosome organization. Therefore, it
is likely that these kinases are acting as nodes in various downstream
pathways that are modulated by Syk in B cells. Some of the important
pathways and functions are summarized in Figure 3b, and the protein lists are given in the SI Tables S3–5. The function of Syk in the immune system has
been widely studied,52 and we observed
the B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway as the most perturbed
canonical pathway (SI Figure S5). Furthermore,
other known Syk-dependent networks, such as FcγRIIB, PI3K, PLC
signaling, NFAT regulation,2 and centrosome
organization, were also observed. More interestingly, we identified
RNA post transcriptional modification and the ubiquitin proteasome
pathway as novel potential Syk-dependent pathways.

Syk-Dependent
Ubiquitination in B Cells
One of the
most intriguing networks in our data annotation is the ubiquitin proteasome
pathway (SI Figure S6 and Table S5). We
identified and quantified a significant number of phosphorylated nodes
that function in this pathway, including E1, E2, E3 ligases, proteasome
components, and deubiquitinases (DUBs). The proteins belonging to
the above categories are summarized in Figure 4a with the SILAC fold change ratios obtained for identified peptides.
Among the different classes of proteins in the ubiquitin proteasome
pathway identified in this study, DUBs are the most prominent group.
The majority of DUBs were found to contain significantly decreased
levels of phosphorylation on one or more sites after Syk inhibition,
such as Y364 on ubiquitin specific peptidase 10 (USP10). Deubiquitinases
are tightly regulated both spatially and temporally, similar to ubiquitin
ligases, thus enabling careful control over cellular signaling and
protein stability.53 Phosphorylation is
thought to be a key regulatory mechanism for DUBs, as was demonstrated
by a recent study of the human deubiquitinase DUBA being controlled
through phosphorylation at S177 by casein kinase (CK2),54 and USP25 has been reported as a Syk substrate.55 This is the first report on the regulation of
ubiquitination by Syk.

respectively. Western blots indicating Syk dependent ubiquitination.

loading control.

Proteomics Analysis of
Syk-Dependent Ubiquitination
To identify ubiquitinated proteins
modulated by Syk, DG75 cells were
treated with MG132 to inhibit the proteasome, and half of the cells
were also treated with piceatannol to inhibit the Syk activity. An
examination of global protein ubiquitination by Western blot analysis
showed a substantial decrease in protein ubiquitination following
the treatment of cells with piceatannol (Figure 4b). After cell lysis and protein digestion, the ubiquitinated peptides
were enriched using an antibody raised against the diglycine motif,
and the resulting peptides were identified using LC–MS/MS.
Quantification was achieved in a label-free manner using a synthetic
peptide library.56 This examination resulted
in the identification and quantification of over 1300 unique ubiquitination
sites. Although the overall level of ubiquitination was increased,
after setting the cutoff values at 2-fold changes based on the library
peptide normalization, we found that 360 and 520 peptides showed decreased
and increased ubiquitination representing 282 and 372 proteins, respectively
(SI Table S6,7). It should be noted that
antiubiquitin antibody used for Western blots shows stronger signals
for polyubiquitinated proteins, whereas antibody against diglycine
residue does not distinguish between mono- and polyubiquitination.
Hence, the ubiquitin proteomics experiment may not perfectly match
the Western blot results. Our goal was to specifically identify proteins
with decreased ubiquitination upon Syk inhibition. A functional annotation
was carried out for the proteins with increased or decreased ubiquitination.
IPA analyses revealed that the proteins with functions in RNA post
transcriptional modifications, and nucleic acid metabolism are prominent
among proteins with decreased ubiquitination, illustrated in Figures 5a and 5b, respectively. For
example, Pre-mRNA-processing-splicing factor 8 (PRPF8), heterogeneous
nuclear ribonucleoprotein H3 (HNRNPH3), RNA-binding protein 39 (RBM39),
and U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein B (SNRPB2) are among proteins
functioning in RNA posttranscriptional regulation specifically by
RNA processing and splicing with decreased ubiquitination levels upon
Syk inhibition.

Conclusion
Previous studies on Syk-dependent
signaling events in B cells focused
mainly on tyrosine phosphorylation, thus limiting information on potentially
diverse Syk functions and downstream signaling events. Because Syk
is an upstream kinase within several signaling cascades, there are
numerous opportunities for serine/threonine phosphorylation events
that can be modulated by its kinase activity. Our integrated approach
of using complementary Ti- and Zr-based phosphopeptide enrichment
with RPLC and HILIC fractionation has led to identification of over
16 000 unique phosphorylation sites and quantification of nearly
4000 peptides with significant phosphorylation changes. The annotation
of corresponding proteins reiterated known Syk-dependent functions
and suggested novel potential networks. Furthermore, canonical pathway
analysis suggested a significant influence of Syk activity on ubiquitination
network in B cells. The subsequent examination of the dependence of
ubiquitination on Syk activity was carried out, and among more than
1300 ubiquitination sites identified, the data showed decreased ubiquitination
levels in RNA processing and splicing proteins in response to Syk
inhibition.
