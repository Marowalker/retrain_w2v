The
conversion of [IrCl(COD)(IMes)] (COD = cis,cis-1,5-cyclooctadiene, IMes = 1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethyl-phenyl)imidazole-2-ylidene)
in the presence of an excess of para-hydrogen (p-H2) and a substrate (4-aminopyridine (4-AP) or 4-methylpyridine (4-MP)) into [Ir(H)2(IMes)(substrate)3]Cl is monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy using a benchtop (1 T) spectrometer in conjunction
with the p-H2-based hyperpolarization
technique signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE). A series
of single-shot 1H NMR measurements are used to monitor
the chemical changes that take place in solution through the lifetime
of the hyperpolarized response. Non-hyperpolarized high-field 1H NMR control measurements were also undertaken to confirm
that the observed time-dependent changes relate directly to the underlying
chemical evolution. The formation of [Ir(H)2(IMes)(substrate)3]Cl is further linked to the hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE)
reaction, which leads to the incorporation of deuterium into the ortho positions of 4-AP, where the source of
deuterium is the solvent, methanol-d4.
Comparable reaction monitoring results are achieved at both high-field
(9.4 T) and low-field (1 T). It is notable that the low sensitivity
of the benchtop (1 T) NMR enables the use of protio solvents, which when used here allows the effects of catalyst formation
and substrate deuteration to be separated. Collectively, these methods illustrate how low-cost low-field NMR
measurements provide unique insight into a complex catalytic process
through a combination of hyperpolarization and relaxation data.

==== Body
Reaction
monitoring using process
analytical technology (PAT) is an important part of synthetic optimization,
reaction scale-up, and industrial quality control.1 Although NMR spectroscopy is a well-established method
for reaction monitoring, standard high-field (7–23 T) NMR spectrometers
are large and costly to both purchase and operate, thereby making
them poorly suited to PAT applications. Recently, low-cost benchtop
NMR spectrometers, based on permanent magnets with field strengths
around 1–2 T, have become available.2 These offer an opportunity to address the issue of cost while also
providing a level of detector portability.2 However, these instruments suffer from relatively low sensitivity
and reduced chemical shift dispersion due to the lower magnetic field
strengths, which limits their viability for the study of low-concentration
analytes and nuclei with low NMR receptivity such as 13C. One potential solution to this issue is to combine benchtop NMR
with hyperpolarization.

Hyperpolarization is a term used to
describe methods that generate
NMR signal responses that are enhanced relative to those associated
with nuclear spins at thermal equilibrium in the detection field.3 Some of the most popular hyperpolarization methods
today are dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP),4 spin-exchange optical pumping (SEOP),5 and para-hydrogen induced polarization (PHIP).6 In the context of industrial process monitoring,
it is essential that the hyperpolarization process itself is low-cost
and compact so that it does not compromise the advantages of benchtop
NMR. Dissolution DNP has been integrated with benchtop NMR for monitoring
the conversion of [1-13C] pyruvate to [1-13C]
lactate in vitro and in vivo.7 However, the generation of hyperpolarized compounds
by dissolution DNP is time-consuming (ca. 90 min per hyperpolarized
sample) as well as costly and requires equipment with a large footprint.
In contrast, we focus here on PHIP methods, which are relatively inexpensive
and yield hyperpolarization in seconds.8

In the traditional approach of Bowers and Weitekamp, para-hydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) is achieved through
hydrogenation
of the molecule under investigation.8a,9 Introduced
in 2009, the signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) method
is a non-hydrogenative version of PHIP that catalytically transfers p-H2-derived polarization without changing the
chemical structure of the target compound.10 In this technique, p-H2 and the target
compound, often called the substrate, bind reversibly to the metal
center of the SABRE catalyst (Figure 1). Once attached to the metal center, the magnetic
symmetry of p-H2 is broken, and the resultant
hydride ligands are able to transfer their latent polarization into
the bound substrate via the J-coupling network of
the complex. This process can be optimized by using a weak magnetic
field that often lies in the range of 0–200 G depending on
the type of nucleus that is to receive the polarization.11 The SABRE method is reversible, taking seconds
to build up polarization, while target molecules can be repolarized
by adding fresh p-H2. Therefore, it provides
a fast and renewable or indeed continuous route to hyperpolarization.
As a result of the relatively cheap methods for generating and storing p-H2 and the comparative simplicity of the SABRE
method, this is an attractive approach for industrial process monitoring
using hyperpolarized benchtop NMR.8 Indeed,
SABRE has already been combined with benchtop NMR to enhance 1H, 13C, and 15N NMR signals.12 One of the limitations of the SABRE method compared
to other approaches such as DNP is the range of substrates that are
amenable to hyperpolarization, with the best results being observed
for N-heterocycles. However, many groups are working to expand the
scope of the SABRE method in order to make it more generally applicable.12d,13 Additionally a number of articles have proposed routes to achieve
biocompatible SABRE hyperpolarization with a view to in vivo detection of biomolecules.14

Figure 1 In the presence
of an excess of para-hydrogen
(p-H2) and substrate, the exchange processes
allows polarization transfer from p-H2 such that NMR resonances of the free substrate are enhanced. This
transfer occurs most often at a low magnetic field (0–200 G)
through the scalar coupling network in the active complex and, because
of its reversibility, operates continuously when fresh p-H2 is supplied.

In this work, we introduce a method to follow reactivity
using
single-shot measurements that probe both the lifetime and the magnitude
of a SABRE-enhanced 1H NMR response. Such measurements
can be easily completed at either high or low field. To illustrate
this method and its benefits, we follow the reaction in which the
SABRE precatalyst converts into the active catalyst. Specifically,
we monitor the formation of [Ir(H)2(IMes)(substrate)3]Cl (IMes = 1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethyl-phenyl)imidazole-2-ylidene).15 Because iridium complexes facilitate the hydrogen
isotope exchange (HIE) reaction, deuteration of the substrate is observed
during this process in methanol-d4.10,16 High-field (9.4 T, 400 MHz) 1H NMR detection is initially
used to measure the changes in SABRE hyperpolarization lifetimes during
the catalyst activation and HIE reactions. Parallel non-hyperpolarized 1H NMR measurements are completed to link the observed changes
in hyperpolarization lifetime to the underlying chemical changes in
solution. Because of the reduced sensitivity and increased peak overlap
in 1H NMR spectra acquired at 1 T (43 MHz), standard 1H NMR reaction monitoring of these processes cannot be achieved
using benchtop NMR. We overcome these limitations by using our hyperpolarized
response while also exploiting the inherent low sensitivity of a benchtop
NMR spectrometer to allow experiments in nondeuterated solvents to
fully differentiate the effects of the active SABRE catalyst formation
from those of target substrate deuteration.

Experimental Section
Sample
Preparation
NMR samples were prepared from a
0.6 mL solution of 5 mM [IrCl(COD)(IMes)] (COD = cis,cis-1,5-cyclooctadiene, IMes = 1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethyl-phenyl)imidazole-2-ylidene)
in methanol-d4 or protio methanol by adding 15 μmol of 4-AP or 4-MP (5 equivalents with respect to the SABRE precatalyst 1) in a 5 mm NMR tube fitted with a Young’s tap (GPE Scientific
Ltd., Leighton Buzzard, UK). The samples were degassed using a three-stage
freeze–pump–thaw method in a bath of dry ice and acetone.
The precatalyst was synthesized in-house, and the 4-AP and 4-MP were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich
Company Ltd., Gillingham, UK) and used without further modification. 1H, 13C, and 15N NMR characterization
data for 4-AP, 4-MP, [Ir(COD)(IMes)(substrate)]Cl,
and [Ir(H)2(IMes)(substrate)3]Cl (substrate
= 4-AP or 4-MP) is available in the Supporting Information.

SABRE Catalyst Activation
Monitoring Using Standard 1H NMR
Solutions containing
the precatalyst 1 with either 4-AP or 4-MP in methanol-d4 or protio methanol formed
the unactivated catalyst [Ir(COD)(IMes)(substrate)]Cl. A 0.6 mL aliquot
of this initial solution was added to a 5 mm NMR tube equipped with
a Young’s tap and degassed following the sample preparation
procedure described above. When 4-MP was used as the
substrate, peaks corresponding to the precatalyst 1 were
observed in the prepared solution and were quantified by 1H NMR at 400 MHz as contributing 15% of the signal, suggesting 85%
of 1 had converted to the unactivated catalyst [Ir(COD)(IMes)(4-MP)]Cl at equilibrium. In contrast, no 1H NMR
peaks corresponding to 1 were observed in the initial 1H NMR spectra for samples where 4-AP was used
as the substrate, suggesting full conversion to 2. When
the conversion of precatalyst 1 into [Ir(COD)(IMes)(4-AP)]Cl 2 was monitored by 1H NMR
spectroscopy for a sample containing 5 mM of 1 and 25
mM of 4-AP in methanol-d4 at 280 K, the reaction took 14 min to reach completion.

To
monitor the formation of the active complex [Ir(H)2(IMes)(substrate)3]Cl (substrate = 4-AP or 4-MP),
H2 (4 bar absolute) was added to the headspace of the NMR
tube. The sample was shaken vigorously for around 5 s and inserted
into the NMR spectrometer (Bruker AVIII 400 MHz) at 298 K. A series
of 1H spectra were acquired over a period of 15.5 h (Figure S4).

Measurement of Hyperpolarized
Signal
SABRE hyperpolarization
transfer experiments were performed under 4 bar p-H2 that was produced by cooling H2 gas over
a paramagnetic catalyst8b,17 at 28 K to yield >99% para-enrichment. After the para-enriched
H2 was added to the headspace of the NMR tube, the sample
was shaken for 5 s in a polarization transfer field (PTF) of 6.1 ±
0.3 mT (61 ± 3 G) generated by a hand-held magnet array,12c to dissolve the p-H2 into solution and allow for polarization transfer to occur. Immediately
following shaking, the sample was transferred manually into the spectrometer
for a single-shot NMR measurement using either a single 90° radiofrequency
(RF) pulse followed by acquisition of the FID or a variable flip angle
single-shot T1 sequence (details below). 1H NMR spectra were acquired on either a Bruker AVIII 400 MHz
spectrometer (9.4 T) or a Magritek Spinsolve Carbon 43 MHz benchtop
NMR spectrometer (1 T). Between each hyperpolarization measurement,
the headspace of the NMR tube was refreshed with p-H2 via the diffusion between the NMR tube headspace and
a line filled with fresh p-H2. The sample
was left to equilibrate for 10 s, and the procedure was repeated twice.
This nonaggressive way of refreshing p-H2 was employed to reduce solvent evaporation and thereby maintain
relative catalyst and substrate concentrations throughout.

Hyperpolarized
Single-Shot T1 Measurement
The
single-shot hyperpolarized T1 measurements
were achieved by acquiring a series of 15 1H NMR spectra,
where the excitation pulse for each acquisition was achieved using
RF pulses of increasing flip angle (see the SI for more details). The variable flip angles were chosen to excite
an equal fraction of the available magnetization at each step of the
experiment in order to simplify the T1 analysis and optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. The variable time
delays between acquisitions were chosen to ensure full coverage of
the T1 decay curve. To remove the influence
of thermally polarized background 1H NMR signals from the T1 analysis, a reference scan was acquired after
each hyperpolarized T1 measurement. This
was achieved by holding the sample outside of the NMR spectrometer
for 1–1.5 min to ensure full relaxation of all polarization
and then manually inserting the sample into the NMR spectrometer and
carrying out a single-shot T1 experiment.
The resultant thermally polarized NMR spectra were integrated and
subtracted from the hyperpolarized signals prior to T1 analysis. Hyperpolarized relaxation times (T1) were determined from an exponential fit of the corrected
hyperpolarized signal decay according to eq 1, where M(t) is magnetization, M0 is the initial
magnetization, T1 is the time constant, t is the time since the application of the first RF pulse,
and Moffset is the offset magnetization. 1  Full details on the variable
flip angle pulse sequence and the parameters used are available in
the Supporting Information.

Results
Reactivity
of [Ir(COD)(IMes)(4-AP)]Cl with H2 and 4-AP in MeOD
In order to prepare
a SABRE active catalyst, a 5 mM concentration of the precatalyst with
the general formula [Ir(Cl)(COD)(NHC)], where NHC is an N-heterocyclic
carbene (complex 1 in Figure 2a), is mixed with an excess of the substrate.
In this study, we used the substrate 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), a potassium channel blocker known as dalfampridine that is registered
as a drug for walking improvement in patients with multiple sclerosis.18 Once this substrate was added to the precatalyst,
the chloride ion is displaced to form complex 2 (Figure 2a). When hydrogen
gas was added to the resulting solution, complex 2 first
oxidatively adds H2 to form the octahedral dihydride complex 3. The cyclooctadiene ligand in this complex was then hydrogenated
to ultimately form cyclooctane (COA), which can no longer ligate.
Consequently, the activated SABRE complex 4 was then
formed in solution with three ligated molecules of 4-AP and two hydrides as shown in Figure 2a.19 When monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy at room temperature, no peaks for complex 1 were detected at 6 min (first scan). However, the transformation
from 2 to 4 can be monitored through their
unique NHC proton resonances at 7.32 ppm (complex 2,
cyan squares) and 6.96 ppm (complex 4, teal squares).

Figure 2 (a) Mechanism
for the conversion of 1 to 4 in the presence
of 4-AP and H2. First, 1 transforms
into [Ir(COD)(IMes)(4-AP)]Cl (2), which
then adds H2 to form the octahedral dihydride
complex [Ir(H)2(COD)(IMes)(4-AP)]Cl (3), which is not stable at room temperature. COD hydrogenation
then follows, and 3 converts to [Ir(H)2(IMes)(4-AP)3]Cl (4) by binding two more
molecules of 4-AP. (b–d) Time-dependent relative
signal intensities calculated from a series of 1H NMR spectra
acquired over the course of the reaction at 298 K for a sample under
4 bar pressure of H2, where the initial concentrations
of 1 and 4-AP are 5 and 25 mM, respectively.
H2 was added, and the sample was shaken only once at the
start of the experiment. (b) Evolution of the carbene ligand signals

(c) Evolution of the meta proton resonance of free
and bound 4-AP (purple, gray, and green triangles). (d)
Evolution of the ortho proton resonance of free and
bound 4-AP (blue, gray, and orange circles).

This conversion can also be monitored via the ortho and meta proton resonances of 4-AP in complex 2 (gray circles and triangles),
complex 4 (orange circles and green triangles), and free
solution
(blue circles and purple triangles). Figure 2 presents the results of 1H NMR
monitoring of the SABRE catalyst activation process over a period
of 15.5 h at room temperature. Figure 3 shows four representative NMR spectra obtained during
the monitoring period. As illustrated in Figure 2b, full conversion of 2 (cyan
squares) to 4 (teal squares) occurs after approximately
11 h. Compared to other studies,14b,20 the formation
of 4 from 2 with 4-AP is very
slow. This is a reflection of the rate of addition of H2 to 2. By contrast, as described later in this paper,
for the case of 4-MP, the formation of [Ir(H)2(IMes)(4-MP)3]Cl is much faster (Figure S4). This suggests that the intermediate
dihydride complex forms much more rapidly when 4-MP is
the substrate. Monitoring of the meta resonances
of 4-AP (Figure 2c) confirms this conversion from 2 (gray triangles)
to 4 (green triangles) while also demonstrating the consumption
of 2 equivalents of 4-AP in free solution (purple triangles),
as expected. In contrast, the ortho proton resonances
of 4-AP show a different dependence on time (Figure 2d). The intensity
of the ortho resonance of 4-AP in complex 4 increases initially, as expected, but decays at longer times.
Similarly, the intensity of the ortho resonance of 4-AP in solution decays initially as expected but continues
to decrease even after the formation of 4 is complete.
These observations are consistent with the deuteration of the ortho positions of 4-AP (Scheme 1), where the source of deuterium is the methanol-d4, which is used as the solvent. These results
suggest that deuteration happens on the same time scale as catalyst
activation, and an analysis of the relative intensities of the ortho and meta resonances of 4-AP indicate that the ortho position deuteration level
reaches 75% by the end of the experiment (15.5 h). Further evidence
for this ortho position deuteration was evident in
the appearance of the corresponding 1H NMR spectra, where
there were significant changes in the line-shape of the meta resonances of 4-AP (Figure S1). No deuteration of the meta positions was observed
on the time scale of the experiment. Additional details and example
spectra are provided in the Supporting Information.

speciation changes. It is noteworthy that the splitting on the meta signal for 4-AP (6.57 ppm) evolves into
a singlet because of the deuteration of the ortho site (7.96 ppm) over the course of the reaction. The signals of
interest are surrounded by the colored boxes. The dashed lines correspond
with the carbene signals in catalysts 2 and 4.

Reaction Monitoring with
SABRE
We seek to establish
here that the SABRE-enhanced NMR response can be assessed through
either the amplitude or the lifetime of the SABRE hyperpolarization.
Both of these parameters have the potential to act as probes for reaction
monitoring and require the collection of data at a series of reaction
time points. The SABRE-lifetime measurements are themselves collected
through a series of single-shot acquisitions that can be repeated
on the time scale of five T1 periods,
which means that a typical observation time reflects a couple of minutes.10,21 The amplitude of the SABRE signal is expected to provide information
on the activation process, because the degree of signal amplification
will increase as the concentration of active catalyst 4 increases. However, the effect of substrate deuteration on this
signal is expected to be complicated. Previous work by Rayner et al.
has suggested that deuteration can lead to increased SABRE efficiency
due to a lengthening of the lifetimes of the remaining 1H resonances within the substrate and the concentration of the SABRE
hyperpolarization into fewer nuclei.22 However,
there is also potential for deuteration to decrease SABRE polarization
transfer efficiency through changes to the J-coupling
network that drive polarization transfer in the low-field regime.11a,11b,22,23 Observations of the changes in the SABRE-enhanced 1H
NMR signal intensity with time suggest that this parameter is sensitive
to both of the chemical transformations under investigation (Figure S5). However, the interpretation of these
effects is complicated by the fact that the SABRE response is not
linearly dependent on substrate concentration in this case. In addition,
any quantitative interpretation would be limited by the reproducibility
of the SABRE response, which depends on many factors including p-H2 enrichment level, polarization transfer
field, polarization build-up time, and sample transport time. Therefore,
we focus here on the use of the lifetime of the SABRE hyperpolarization
to monitor reactivity.

The lifetime of the SABRE hyperpolarization
is limited by longitudinal (T1) NMR relaxation
times, which are sensitive to the chemical environment and have been
widely used for identifying and characterizing inter and intramolecular
interactions.24 In this method, we exploit
the fact that in the presence of the active SABRE catalyst, the substrate
molecules in free solution and those bound to 4 are in
rapid chemical exchange. As a result, the observed lifetime of the
SABRE hyperpolarization reflects a weighted average of the lifetime
for substrate molecules bound to 4 and substrate molecules
in free solution.25 NMR relaxation times
are known to be significantly shorter for the bound substrate molecules.25 Therefore, as the concentration of the active
SABRE catalyst 4 increases, the observed hyperpolarization
lifetime is expected to decrease. This shortening of the relaxation
times in the presence of the activated complex is a well-known effect
in the SABRE literature.22,25 In addition, the observed
lifetime of the SABRE hyperpolarization of the meta resonances of 4-AP is expected to increase following
substitution of 2H for 1H in the adjacent ortho position (Scheme 1).22,26 Therefore, the time-dependent
changes of the hyperpolarization lifetimes for the meta resonances of 4-AP are expected to reflect the competing
effects of the formation of 4 and the partial deuteration
of 4-AP. In contrast, the hyperpolarization lifetimes
for the ortho resonances of 4-AP are
expected to reflect only the formation of 4. This is
because a 1H NMR signal will only be observed for the 1H ortho resonances of 4-aminopyridine and
4-amino-2-d1-pyridine. In both of these
cases, the observed ortho1H hyperpolarization
lifetime will be dominated by interactions with the 1H
in the adjacent meta position and therefore is not
expected to be affected significantly by the progress of the 1H–2H exchange reaction.22

Parallel measurements of non-hyperpolarized 1H NMR spectra
and hyperpolarization lifetimes were performed as a function of time
following the first addition of p-H2 with
detection on a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer in methanol-d4 (Figure 4a and b). Non-hyperpolarized 1H NMR spectra indicate that
the formation of 4 is complete by 230 min following the
first addition of p-H2 (Figure 4a). This activation time is
indicated by the vertical dashed lines in Figure 4b–d. Figure 4b shows the change in the ortho (blue circles) and meta (purple triangles) 1H hyperpolarization lifetimes as a function of time following
the initial addition of p-H2. Each hyperpolarization-lifetime
measurement is achieved using a manual shaking SABRE procedure with
NMR detection at 9.4 T and where the p-H2 in the headspace of the NMR tube was refreshed between each measurement.
In Figure 4b, the hyperpolarization
lifetimes for the ortho resonances of 4-AP reduce and reach a plateau in a time period that corresponds to
the formation of 4. In contrast, the lifetimes of the meta resonances show an initial rapid increase with a subsequent
decrease at longer times. These observations support our hypothesis
that the hyperpolarization lifetimes of the meta resonances
are sensitive to both the formation of 4 and substrate
deuteration, whereas the hyperpolarization lifetimes of the ortho resonances are sensitive only to the formation of 4. The initial change in the lifetime of the meta resonances indicates a more rapid incorporation of 2H
into 4-AP when p-H2 was replenished
between measurements rather than added once at the start of the experiment
(Figure 2). This increase
in the rate of the HIE reaction is supported by the observed changes
in the line shape of the meta resonances in the standard 1H NMR spectra acquired at 400 MHz (Figure S3).

Figure 4 (a) Non-hyperpolarized 1H NMR signal integrals of the 4-APmeta proton resonance, acquired in parallel
with the hyperpolarization-lifetime measurements (b) at 400 MHz in
methanol-d4. (b) Hyperpolarization signal

(d) as (c) but in protio methanol. The initial concentration
of 4-AP is 25 mM, which gives a 2-fold excess relative
to [Ir(H)2(IMes)(4-AP)3]Cl (5 mM)
once its formation is complete. Error bars indicate the standard error
from the fit to the hyperpolarization decay curve specified by eq 1. The time point for complete
conversion to 4 is represented by the vertical line.

The use of SABRE hyperpolarization
to increase sensitivity allows
us to repeat this reaction monitoring procedure on a 1 T benchtop
NMR spectrometer (Figure 4c). The time-dependent changes in hyperpolarization lifetime
determined using the benchtop NMR instrument show the same trends
as the experiments using a standard (9.4 T) NMR spectrometer. This
illustrates that SABRE hyperpolarization can be used to enable reaction
monitoring at both high- and low-field. In fact, here we use benchtop
NMR where a combination of low sensitivity and peak overlap would
normally prevent this monitoring process. Furthermore, once the sensitivity
limitation is overcome through the use of hyperpolarization, there
are additional benefits to using benchtop NMR. Because of its lower
magnetic field strength, benchtop 1H NMR spectra can be
acquired in the presence of a protonated solvent without the need
to actively suppress the solvent signal. Indeed, it has been found
that the SABRE-hyperpolarized NMR response from a low-concentration
analyte can exceed that from a protonated solvent when detected at
1 T (43 MHz).12bFigure 4d shows the change in the ortho (blue circles) and meta (purple triangles) 1H hyperpolarization lifetimes as a function of time following
the initial addition of p-H2 for the case
where protio methanol is the solvent and a 1 T benchtop
NMR spectrometer are used for detection. In the absence of the source
of deuterium (methanol-d4) the hyperpolarization
lifetimes of both the ortho and meta protons follow the same trend: a monotonic decrease to a plateau
on the same time scale as the formation of the activated SABRE complex, 4. The absence of the initial increase in the meta hyperpolarization lifetime supports the hypothesis that this feature
of the previous experiments originated from the deuteration effect.
Therefore, not only does the use of SABRE hyperpolarization enable
reaction monitoring using a benchtop NMR spectrometer, but also the
use of this low-field (1 T) instrument provides a simple route to
the deconvolution of the competing effects of SABRE catalyst activation
and substrate deuteration.

To further verify the method, we
have applied it to an analogous
SABRE system where the substrate is 4-methylpyridine (4-MP). When the reaction is monitored after a single exposure to H2, even though rapid formation of [Ir(H)2(IMes)(4-MP)3]Cl (∼50 min) is indicated, the time
scale for deuteration is comparable to that with 4-AP. This suggests that [Ir(H)2(IMes)(4-AP)3]Cl is more active for the HIE reaction than [Ir(H)2(IMes)(4-MP)3]Cl (Figure S4). This difference in behavior is consistent with the predicted
C–H bond strengths in the substrates on the basis of inductive
changes. One further consequence of this behavior is that when the
hyperpolarized lifetimes are probed over the first 65 min, rapid catalyst
activation is observed with negligible deuteration. The analogous
hyperpolarized lifetimes in protonated methanol exhibit the same trend,
further supporting the deduction of the absence of significant deuteration
on the time scale of the experiment (Figures S9 and S10).

Conclusions
We have introduced a
method for using SABRE-enhanced 1H NMR spectroscopy to
monitor reactivity, even at a mM concentration
level, through the quantification of hyperpolarization lifetimes.
This method was used to monitor the formation of the active SABRE
catalyst from a precatalyst and hydrogen isotope exchange within the
substrate, 4-aminopyridine. This method was demonstrated using both
high-field (9.4 T, 400 MHz) and benchtop (1 T, 43 MHz) NMR detection.
Comparable results were obtained at both fields, illustrating the
utility of this approach for reaction monitoring on a benchtop NMR
spectrometer even under conditions where thermal 1H NMR
cannot be used due to low sensitivity and peak overlap. In addition,
the use of a low-field benchtop NMR spectrometer for detection allowed
experiments to be carried out in a protio solvent.
For the reactivity explored herein, this provided a route to separating
out the effects of the formation of the SABRE catalyst and the hydrogen
isotope exchange reaction, by removing the source of 2H
for the isotope exchange, methanol-d4.
More generally, the ability to carry out reaction monitoring in a
nondeuterated solvent renders this method more attractive for industrial
applications where metal complexes are used to achieve high-value
organic transformations, as it removes the need for costly sample
preparation step prior to analysis.27

The studies completed in this work followed reactivity under two
different regimes within a sealed NMR tube: first, in the absence
of stirring where slow diffusion of hydrogen across the gas–liquid
interface is expected and second, where hydrogen in solution was replenished
between experiments through vigorous shaking of the NMR tube. In future
work, a flow-based SABRE approach, where p-H2 is bubbled through the solution outside of the spectrometer,28 could provide a route to automating the reaction
monitoring method and providing more control over the reaction conditions.

In situ SABRE measurements, where detection is achieved in mT−μT
magnetic fields such as the Earth’s magnetic field, could also
be used to provide increased control over the reaction conditions
throughout the monitoring process. However, in this case, there would
be a need for reference measurements to isolate the source of the
hyperpolarized response, as no chemical shift information is available
in such ultralow-field NMR spectra. The quantitative aspects of the
method can be improved by calibrating the hyperpolarization lifetimes
to link changes in lifetime to changes in the concentration of the
active SABRE species.
