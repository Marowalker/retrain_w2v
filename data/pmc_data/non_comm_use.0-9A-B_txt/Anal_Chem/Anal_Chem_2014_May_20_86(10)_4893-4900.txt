In
this work, we report the first copper-based point-of-care sensor
for electrochemical measurements demonstrated by zinc determination
in blood serum. Heavy metals require careful monitoring, yet current
methods are too complex for a point-of-care system. Electrochemistry
offers a simple approach to metal detection on the microscale, but
traditional carbon, gold (Au), or platinum (Pt) electrodes are difficult
or expensive to microfabricate, preventing widespread use. Our sensor
features a new low-cost electrode material, copper, which offers simple
fabrication and compatibility with microfabrication and PCB processing,
while maintaining competitive performance in electrochemical detection.
Anodic stripping voltammetry of zinc using our new copper-based sensors
exhibited a 140 nM (9.0 ppb) limit of detection (calculated) and sensitivity
greater than 1 μA/μM in the acetate buffer. The sensor
was also able to determine zinc in a bovine serum extract, and the
results were verified with independent sensor measurements. These
results demonstrate the advantageous qualities of this lab-on-a-chip
electrochemical sensor for clinical applications, which include a
small sample volume (μL scale), reduced cost, short response
time, and high accuracy at low concentrations of analyte.

==== Body
Point-of-care
(POC) devices
that are accurate, robust, low cost, rapid, easy-to-use, and disposable
are in great demand for determination of trace metals in blood, either
in exposure assessment or in clinical settings. Conventional methods
are based on atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS)1 or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).2 While both of these methods provide accurate
measurements in serum or blood, they require expensive instrumentation
and highly trained operators. Furthermore, significant time delays
are associated with these approaches due to shipping of samples to
centralized laboratories, making them less desirable or even unsuitable.
Another challenge is that the amount of sample necessary to perform
these analyses is often significant and can be difficult to obtain
in pediatric or severely ill patients.

Herein, we use the determination
of zinc (Zn) as a representative
example to demonstrate a new copper-based sensor for POC. Zn is an
essential trace metal that plays a key role in metabolism as a component
of many enzymes, hormones, and nucleic acid transcription-related
factors.3,4 Pediatric and adult studies have consistently
demonstrated abnormally low Zn levels in critically ill patients.5−7 While Zn homeostasis can be easily restored through Zn supplementation,8−10 excess Zn intake can lead to copper deficiency and neurologic disease
such as myelopathy or Alzheimer’s.11,12 For such patients, careful monitoring of Zn levels in blood becomes
critically important for the supplementation strategy to work. Traditionally,
such measurements are performed in blood serum, with total Zn concentrations
in the 65–95 μg/dL (10–15 μM) range.13

Anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) is
a demonstrated approach for
determining Zn and other trace metals. Figure 1a schematically illustrates the concept. The analysis involves a
preconcentration step to accumulate the target metal ions onto the
electrode surface by reducing them to atoms, followed by a positively
scanned stripping step to reoxidize the metal back to its ionic form.
ASV is rapid and can be cost-effective, while reaching limits of detection
(LODs) in the subnanomolar range. In recent work, we14−16 reported the first microscale sensor for determination of Zn and
manganese (Mn) using a bismuth (Bi) working electrode (with silver/silver
chloride reference and gold auxiliary electrodes). While the sensor
performed reliably in acetate buffer with a LOD of 6 μM for
Zn, detection in serum exhibited large variability,15 making determination challenging. Moreover, use of gold
is not conducive to low-cost disposable sensors needed in this POC
application.

electrode.

auxiliary electrode (AE), and reference electrode (RE). (c) Photograph
of the sensor with a mini-USB potentiostat connection.

Herein, we report a new sensor concept that uses
copper (Cu) film
as the sensing element. Cu is not a material typically used as a working
electrode in voltammetric analyses because it is easily oxidized.
Nevertheless, it offers a number of advantages that we cannot overlook.
It is a commonly used material in electronics, is significantly lower
in cost than gold or platinum, and is compatible with numerous microfabrication
methods. Thus, we developed an electrochemical sensor that consists
of a single metal layer, patterned in a single photolithography step
to form all three electrodes used for ASV: a Cu working electrode
(WE), a Cu auxiliary electrode (AE), and a reference electrode formed
by chloridization (Cu/CuCl2, RE). While Cu REs have been
considered in the 1960s,17 they were rejected
due to relatively high activity and thus poor long-term stability.
In this work, this limitation is offset by ease of fabrication, in
the context of a disposable sensor application. The electrochemical
cell is schematically shown in Figure 1b. Our
experimental results show that such a sensor is sufficiently stable
for at least one electrochemical measurement, which is more than sufficient
when disposable POC applications are considered. The Cu-based sensor
(Figure 1c) was optimized to demonstrate a
LOD of 140 nM (9.0 ppb) and good linearity below 5 μM. Ultimately,
with additional integration of sample preparation on chip, a portable
sensor system capable of Zn determination in only a 100 μL sample
(a couple drops of blood) can be developed.

Experimental Section
Reagents
Reagents were prepared from chemicals purchased
from Fisher Scientific, unless stated otherwise. Piranha solution
was prepared from H2SO4 and H2O2 in 7:3 v/v ratio. Copper etchant was prepared from H2SO4, H2O2, and deionized
(DI) water in 1:1:10 v/v/v ratio. Titanium etchant was prepared from
HNO3, HF, and DI water in 1:2:7 v/v/v ratio. Sodium acetate
buffer (0.1 M, pH 4.65) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Acetate
buffers with pH from 5 to 6.5 were prepared by addition of NaOH(s)
to the commercial buffer. Solutions containing 0.1 μM to 10
mM Zn were prepared by diluting Zn stock solution (TraceCERT, 1000
mg/L in 2% nitric acid, Fluka) with acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 6).
Reagents used in the extraction procedure will be indicated in that
section.18−20

Fabrication of Cu-Based Sensors
The sensor was fabricated
using a combination of lithographic and deposition techniques. Metal
layers of 20 nm titanium (Ti) /200 nm Cu were evaporated (Temescal
FC-1800 E-Beam Evaporator) onto glass slides cleaned in Piranha solution.
An etching mask of ∼2 μm was formed using photolithography
with Shipley 1818 photoresist and developer 351. The three-electrode
patterns with contact pads were formed by wet etching in Cu etchant
for 10 s followed by Ti etchant for 3 s, with 1 min of rinsing in
DI water after each etching step. An integrated Ag/AgCl RE was fabricated
by electroplating approximately 300 nm Ag (Techni-Silver Cyless II
RTU, Technic Inc.) on Cu for 60 s with cathodic current of 3 mA/cm2 and then chloridizing the Ag in 1 M KCl with anodic current
of the same current density for 30 s to convert part of the silver
film to AgCl. The new RE, Cu/CuCl2, was fabricated by chloridizing
Cu in 1 M KCl with a 3 mA/cm2 anodic current for 30 s.
During the electrodeposition, the integrated Cu AE was used to sustain
the current.

A polymer well with ∼9 mm diameter and 3
mm thickness was fabricated in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using the
standard soft lithography process.21 It
was bonded to a clean glass substrate containing the electrode patterns
using plasma discharge (BD-20AC, Electo-Technic Products Inc.) after
20 s of treatment on the PDMS surface only. A diagram of the sensor
illustrating the three electrodes and PDMS well is shown in Figure 1b. An interface consisting of an edge-board connector
(Sullins, EBC05DRAS) and a mini-USB port were soldered on a PCB to
simplify and improve connection between the sensor and the potentiostat.

Sample Extraction Procedure
An extraction procedure
with trifluoroacetic acid was used to extract Zn from bovine serum.
Dithizone (12.8 mg) was first dissolved in 10 mL chloroform and deprotonated
by mixing with 10 mL (pH 9) 1 M ammonia/0.5 M ammonium buffer solution
to form the extracting solution. Then the extracting solution was
mixed with the solution containing 1 mL bovine serum and 0.5 mL of
0.05 M potassium thiocyanate ethanolic solution. The mixture was sonicated
for 5 min and then transferred into a 50 mL plastic tube and centrifuged
for 10 min at 4000 rpm. The organic phase was collected and sonicated
with 10 mL 2 M trifluoroacetic acid for another 5 min. The clear aqueous
phase was collected and mixed with acetate buffer (0.1 M). The pH
was adjusted to 6 with NaOH for the following ASV experiments.

Electrochemical
Experiments
A miniature USB WaveNow
Potentiostat/Galvanostat (AFTP1, Pine Instrument) with AfterMath Data
Organizer software was used in all electrochemical experiments. A
sensor was inserted into the interface and connected to the potentiostat
using a mini-USB cable (Figure 1c). Chronopotentiometry
under 10 μA current was performed to evaluate the quality of
the Cu AE, while a Bruker ContourGT-K1 Optical Microscope was used
to scan its surface roughness. Both cyclic voltammetry (CV) and ASV
were performed to compare potential windows and stability of sensors
with two types of REs. ASV was also used to calibrate the Cu WE for
Zn and to measure the Zn level in unknown samples. For all the experiments
performed in the buffer, we used 100 μL as the sample volume;
it was increased to 200 μL for the measurements in serum. The
sweep rate for CV was 100 mV/s. After a series of optimizations of
preconcentration conditions and stripping waveform parameters, we
selected −1 V as the preconcentration potential with 300 s
duration, a stripping range from −1 to −0.3 V, and waveform
parameters of 50 ms for period, 6 mV for increment, and 60 mV for
amplitude. For the calculation of the detection limit, we repeated
our lowest measurable data point, 100 nM of Zn, for 7× and obtained
the standard deviation. We also obtained the slope of the correlation
equation and calculated the LOD as 3σ/slope.

Results and Discussion
Novel
Cu-Based Sensor
Our previous work14,22 demonstrated a miniature electrochemical cell with Bi WE for detection
of metals such as Mn and Zn that exhibit a very negative stripping
potential. The sensor size was approximately 15 × 19 mm, required
only microliters of sample, and performed an analysis in less than
15 min. While both electrodeposited and thermally evaporated Bi films
were investigated, it is the evaporated Bi WEs that proved to exhibit
more stable (coefficient of variation <2%) measurements of Zn in
acetate buffer.16 Although the evaporated
Bi WEs performed well (LOD = 60 nM), the fabrication procedure for
these electrodes was complex and costly, requiring multiple photolithography,
e-beam evaporation, and lift-off process steps. For a disposable sensor,
cost is the most critical challenge after performance. Thus, we investigated
new materials for disposable POC electrochemical sensors, with the
goal of low-cost and simple fabrication, while retaining good electrochemical
performance.

To overcome the aforementioned shortcomings of
the Bi-based sensors, we developed a sensor based on a Cu thin film.
Using Cu as the sensor material has the potential to address all of
the challenges of a disposable POC sensor, from the fabrication prospective.
Our sensor consisted of a Cu WE, a Cu/CuCl2 RE, and a Cu
AE, as illustrated in Figure 1b. The layout
of the electrode patterns was generally similar to our earlier work,
with a user-friendly interface that integrated an edge board connector
and a mini-USB port to provide simplified connection and accessibility
(Figure 1c). Fabrication of such a sensor involves
a single photolithography step on a thermally evaporated Cu film.
This is a significant improvement, eliminating the alignment necessary
for the second photolithography step in evaporated Bi WE fabrication.
Migrating to a Cu/CuCl2 RE can also eliminate the additional
step of electroplating silver in the fabrication of a Ag/AgCl RE.
These advantages of Cu from the cost and fabrication points of view
make the Cu-based sensor concept highly appealing if the electrochemical
performance is acceptable. Thus, experiments were performed to examine
suitability of Cu for all three electrodes for ASV measurements in
a disposable sensor intended for single use applications.

Cu Auxiliary
Electrode
It was critical to first demonstrate
that a Cu AE can provide stable current during both preconcentration
and stripping steps, since a Cu AE is easily oxidized when functioning
as an anode in ASV. In conventional electrochemical cells, AEs are
fabricated from inert materials, such as Pt or graphite. Thus, we
assessed the stability of our Cu AE by comparing it with a Pt electrode
using chronopotentiometry under 10 μA current, which is the
typical upper limit of current we see in stripping experiments. During
this experiment, we used a graphite electrode as the cathode, with
Cu or Pt as the anode.

As expected, the Pt electrode maintained
a stable potential at about 1.3 V for the oxidation of water during
the entire 60 min experiment (Figure 2b), indicating
that it is an excellent, perfectly polarizable AE. The Cu electrode,
on the other hand, is a nonpolarizable electrode undergoing oxidation
during the entire process. To evaluate stability of multiple devices,
we repeated the experiment (n = 4) with a fresh disposable
sensor each time and obtained the average curve. All Cu AEs exhibited
a stable behavior for the first 10 min by providing relatively constant
potential below 0.1 V for the oxidation of Cu. The oxidation and stripping
of Cu occurred at a low rate, which had little effect on the surface
of the electrode during this time (Figure 2a; 0 min). Roughness of a fresh Cu surface was 0.3 ± 0.03 nm.
The observed signal variability was quite low (coefficient of variation
= 5%), although the Pt electrode was clearly superior (coefficient
of variation = 0.2%). In the next 10 min, however, the potential began
drifting positively, which coincides with an observable degree of
degradation of the AE, reduced Cu thickness, and increased surface
roughness to 6.1 ± 2.3 nm (Figure 2a;
20 min). After 20 min, the potential shifted abruptly to a significantly
more positive value where the AE continued to function but with erratic
behavior of the potential. At this stage, the electrode process is
probably a combination of Cu and water oxidation because the Cu surface
area is below the level needed to sustain the 10 μA current
by Cu oxidation alone. By 60 min, the Cu layer of the electrode is
largely removed (Figure 2a; 60 min), with the
surface roughness increased to 13.4 ± 11.5 nm. This introduced
a substantial increase in resistance for a given current (Figure 2b).

Figure 2 Stability of Cu as an auxiliary electrode. (a) Images
of a clean
Cu AE and Cu AEs that have undergone 20 and 60 min of oxidation with
zoom-in optical profiler images illustrating surface roughness (scale
bar represents 100 μm). (b) Chronopotentiometry of Pt and Cu
AEs under the current of 10 μA. The Cu AEs varied in thickness
from 200 nm to >1 μm. The curve for 200 nm Cu AE is an average
of n = 4 measurements. Close-up of the point of failure
indicated with dashed line is shown in the inset, which illustrates
the actual four curves used in obtaining the average.

These results demonstrate that a Cu anode is able
to sustain current
and thus could be used as an AE if the experiment time is kept short.
For most stripping analyses, 10 min is sufficient and the current
during preconcentration is generally below 10 μA. Thus, a 200
nm thick Cu AE is acceptable for our disposable sensors. For preconcentration
duration longer than 10 min with larger current, the Cu AE film may
be oxidized completely. In this case the sensor will no longer function
as a three-electrode system. This issue could be relieved by depositing
a thicker layer of Cu or designing a larger AE. With more sacrificial
Cu for oxidation, the stable flat region can be extended to over 1
h, depending on film thickness (Figure 2b).
If more robust electrodes are still needed (e.g., for applications
with more acidic electrolyte or longer preconcentration time for lower
LOD), the electrode could be formed from a thicker layer of Cu. Alternatively,
it could be coated by a more-polarizable metal such as palladium (Pd),
but this would complicate the fabrication procedure. Having established
that the Cu AE is capable of supporting current for the duration sufficient
for rapid analysis, we next examined the electrochemical performance
of the Cu/CuCl2 RE.

Cu/CuCl2 Reference
Electrode
We used CV
to evaluate the Cu/CuCl2 RE of our Cu-based sensor and
compare it with the commonly used Ag/AgCl RE. CVs were performed in
acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 6) spiked with 10 mM Zn to indicate the
position of the stripping peak. We used two sensors for these experiments,
one with an integrated Ag/AgCl RE and one with the new Cu/CuCl2 RE. As results in Figure 3 illustrate,
the Zn stripping peak on a Cu WE occurs at −970 mV vs Ag/AgCl
but shifts more positively to −910 mV for sensors using Cu/CuCl2 RE. The 60 mV difference in peak potential due to differences
in RE half-cell potentials is not significant. Overall, the performance
of Cu/CuCl2 RE in CV analysis appears to be comparable
to sensors with Ag/AgCl RE. In the next set of experiments, we examined
stability of the Cu/CuCl2 RE.

Figure 3 Cyclic voltammetry performed
with Cu/CuCl2 (solid) or
Ag/AgCl (dashed) as RE, in acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 6) with 10 mM
Zn. Scan rate = 100 mV/s.

To access stability of the Cu/CuCl2 RE, we examined
the open circuit potential against a commercially available double-junction
Ag/AgCl RE (MI-401F, Microelectrodes Inc.) in saturated KCl solution
(4.6 M at 20 °C) to accelerate electrode aging (see the Supporting Information).23 The drift of the Cu/CuCl2 RE is quite large compared
to other microscale Ag/AgCl RE electrodes reported in the literature,24−26 but our fabrication procedures, materials, and electrode structure
are more advantageous. Thus, additional comparison of the Cu/CuCl2 and Ag/AgCl REs in our sensor is needed before a conclusion
can be reached.

Next, and more importantly, we tested performance
of the integrated
Cu/CuCl2 and Ag/AgCl REs in practical samples by examining
their open circuit potentials against the commercial Ag/AgCl RE in
acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 6). To simulate the working environment
of our integrated REs in the buffer, no additional Cl– was introduced (except for the minute amount of impurity in NaOH
used to adjust pH and any Cl– resulting from the
dissolution of CuCl2 and AgCl from the surfaces of the
reference electrodes), so both the REs were unpoised and examined
directly. The potential difference between the integrated Cu/CuCl2 and the commercial Ag/AgCl REs was −59 ± 3 mV,
while the difference between the integrated and commercial Ag/AgCl
RE was −36 ± 6 mV (Figure 4a).
The Cu/CuCl2 RE exhibited a short ∼28 s response
time in stabilizing the potential difference, which was faster than
the 46 s observed for the Ag/AgCl RE. This difference in the response
time may be due to differences in solubility of CuCl2 and
AgCl, which suggests that measurements in the Cu-based electrochemical
cell can be performed soon after introducing the sample and does not
require a 46 s wait period for stabilization as is the case with the
Ag/AgCl RE. The more convenient fabrication process combined with
its acceptable stability in buffer makes the integrated Cu/CuCl2 RE an attractive option for this sensor compared to the conventional
Ag/AgCl reference electrode.

Each curve is an average of n = 3. (b) ASV of 10
μM Zn in the acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 6) with increasing duration
of preconcentration. The Zn peak is at −809 ± 8.5 mV.
The inset illustrates potential of Zn anodic stripping peak vs preconcentration
time (n = 3).

To assess stability of the Cu/CuCl2 RE in stripping
analysis, we performed ASV on samples containing 10 μM Zn in
acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 6) with preconcentration times ranging from
1 to 10 min. The potential of the resulting Zn peaks (Figure 4b) shifted from −792 to −821 mV, with
an increase in the preconcentration time. The average potential of
the Zn peaks was −809 ± 8.5 mV, while the peaks slowly
drifted at a rate of −2.9 mV/min (inset in Figure 4b). While these results suggest that the Cu/CuCl2 RE is not perfectly stable, this shift does not actually
affect our application since we are measuring the amplitude of Zn
peak current and the Zn peak potentials do not exhibit direct correlations
to the peak amplitudes. For our target sample matrix, which is blood
serum, trace metals that exhibit stripping peaks in the potential
range of interest are present in blood (Mn and Cd) and could interfere
with Zn determination. Other metals present in serum, such as Pb strip
at potentials that are substantially more positive than Zn and are
not expected to interfere. The Cd and Mn peaks are expected to occur
at ∼400 mV more positive and ∼200 mV more negative than
Zn, respectively. These stripping peaks however are absent from the
voltammograms in our study. Another metal, Cr, is present in trace
levels in blood, at approximately 77–500 nM (or 3.6–27
ppb).27 These trace levels are at the LOD
of our sensor, and thus any presence in the sample would lead to a
minute peak that would not severely affect Zn stripping. Having established that Cu-based auxiliary and reference electrodes
are possible, we focused on determining if Cu can be used as a working
electrode for ASV.

Cu Working Electrode
Copper has
never, to our knowledge,
been used as a pure, solid metal working electrode to perform stripping
voltammetry, though some previous research has explored using Cu amalgam
drop or solid electrode for the determination of trace metals,28,29 and thus its potential window is not known. As the first step in
evaluating the Cu WE, we compared it with commonly used Au WE and
Bi WE we used in the past,15,16 using a standard three-electrode
system (Ag/AgCl RE and external Pt AE). Figure 5a shows the results for CV in the acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 4.65),
illustrating the negative potential working range of the three electrodes.
The positive end of the working range of the Cu electrode extends
to its oxidation potential of ∼0 V, which is more positive
than the stripping potential of Bi. The significant increase in current
at negative potentials indicates reduction of water, which leads to
degradation of the electrode and gas evolution at the AE. The negative
end of the working range of the Cu WE extends to approximately −0.95
V, which is between that of Au and Bi WEs. Despite the water reduction
starting at −1.1 V, the potential window of Cu is still sufficiently
wide for determination of Zn, offering a 130–190 mV window
for Zn predeposition. The actual potential for the Zn peak still depends
on the choice of REs.

Figure 5 (a) Cyclic voltammetry of different WE materials in the
acetate
buffer (0.1 M, pH 4.65) with commercial Ag/AgCl (double junction)
RE and Pt AE. Scan rate = 100 mV/s. Inset illustrates threshold potentials
(i = 10 μA) of different WE materials (n = 3). (b) Cyclic voltammetry of Cu-based sensor in the
acetate buffer (0.1 M) at different pH. Scan rate was 100 mV/s. (c)
The threshold potential (i = 4 μA) at different
pH (n = 3).

The inset of Figure 5a compares the
negative
potential limits of the three electrodes at 10 μA threshold
current, which is typical of ASV analysis. With the Zn stripping peak
at −0.8 V, the potential limit of the Cu film is sufficiently
negative to make it a suitable electrode material. The potential limit
of Bi is −1.2 V. While the Zn stripping peak on the evaporated
Bi WE shifts to approximately −1.1 V, Bi is also suitable.
Gold, with the least negative potential limit of −0.8 V, does
not have the range for Zn detection, as substantial increase in current
due to reduction of water drowns the Zn stripping signal. As our analysis
of the potential window shows, the Cu WE offers a sufficiently negative
range for determination of Zn (and other trace metals with less negative
stripping potentials, such as Pb and Cd), without exhibiting too much
H+ reduction.

To further explore the
electrochemical characteristics of the Cu-based sensor, we investigated
the effect of buffer pH on the potential window of the Cu electrode.
CV analysis was performed in 0.1 M acetate buffers with pHs in the
4.65–6.5 range. As results in Figure 5b show, the potential window of the sensor expands negatively as
pH approaches neutral values, due to decrease in H+/water
reduction current with decreased concentration of H+ in
the solution as expected. Dependence of the potential window of the
Cu WE can be seen in Figure 5c, which plots
the negative potential limits for each pH at a threshold current of
4 μA, which is the maximum current at pH 6.5. For acetate buffer
with pH < 4.65, water electrolysis begins at a more positive potential
than the Zn stripping peak. For buffer with pH > 6.5, Zn2+ forms hydroxides,30 which affects the
actual free ion concentration in the solution, and mass transport
to the electrode surface to deposit Zn atoms, leading to large variability.
Thus, for anodic stripping voltammetry, buffer with a more acidic
pH is preferably selected to prevent precipitation of metal hydroxides,
especially for Pb or Cd which tend to form less soluble hydroxides
than Zn. Compared with the Bi WE, the potential window of the Cu-based
sensor is smaller but is sufficiently negative to permit determination
of trace metals such as Zn, Cd, or Pb.

ASV in Acetate Buffer
Following optimization of experimental
and stripping waveform parameters (see the Supporting
Information), a calibration curve was constructed by performing
ASV in 100 μL of acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 6) with Zn spiked
from 100 nM to 40 μM, as shown in Figure 6. This range brackets the physiological range of Zn in blood (10–15
μM), while illustrating that the LOD of the sensor allows for
multifold dilution, if necessary. We used the optimized square wave
ASV (SWASV) parameters, as discussed in Supporting
Information. For most concentrations, we repeated experiments
three times (n =  3), using a new
disposable device each time to obtain standard deviation. Representative
stripping voltammograms over the entire concentration range from 100
nM to 40 μM are shown in Figure 6a.

Figure 6 ASV of
Zn samples in (a) a range from 100 nM to 40 μM range.
Calibration curves for Zn using (b) peak height and (c) peak area
of stripping voltammograms. Experiments performed in acetate buffer
(0.1 M, pH 6, 100 μL sample volume).

The resulting calibration curves appeared to be bimodal (Figure 6b), with each segment exhibiting strong linearity.
The correlation equation is I (μA) = 1.101
× [Zn (μM)] + 0.648 (R2 = 0.993
for 5 data points) for the concentrations below 5 μM, and I (μA) = 0.394 × [Zn (μM)] + 4.546 (R2 = 0.968 for 6 data points) for the concentrations
above 5 μM. The calibration plot in the lower range (<5 μM)
exhibited higher sensitivity (1.1 μA/μM). For 100 nM,
which was the lowest Zn concentration sample, an n =  7 was used to calculate the detection limit LOD = 140
nM (9.0 ppb) based on 3σ/slope. Compared with the Bi sensor
we reported previously,16 the calculated
LOD of the Cu-based sensor for Zn determination is close, but we were
able to experimentally measure much lower Zn concentration (100 nM
vs 1 μM). Kefala31 and Demetriades32 also reported much lower detection limits for
Zn using bi-coated glassy carbon electrodes or pencil-lead graphite
(6 nM or 0.4 ppb), but the inability to microfabricate these electrodes
has prevented their use in point-of-care applications. The lower linear
range (<5 μM) is below the physiological range of 10–15
μM. This is important since dilution is unavoidable during serum
extraction, and the performance of sensors with extracted samples
is not as good as that in the buffer, as we discuss below. For the
Cu-based sensor, the linear range brackets the physiological range
of 10–15 μM Zn in serum with a dilution factor of 3–100×.

We also investigated higher concentrations of Zn from 5–40
μM for complete characterization. Double peaks appeared when
concentration exceeded 20 μM, which is a common phenomenon on
solid electrodes.33 We attribute this to
the difference in stripping potential for Zn that has been deposited
on a thin layer of Zn instead of on Cu WE at high concentrations,
since the surface of the Cu WE becomes covered with a monolayer of
Zn atoms before the deposition is complete. Thus, Zn will be stripped
from different surfaces at different potentials, resulting in broadened
or doubled stripping peaks. Specifically for voltammograms in the
20–40 μM range, we considered the left shoulder to be
related to Zn stripped from the Zn surface, and the peak on the positive
side to be attributed to Zn oxidized from the Cu surface. Therefore,
we measured the peak height of positive peaks for the 20–40
μM range to plot the calibration curve (red in Figure 6b). As clearly seen from the result, the broad double
peaks lead to an almost 3× loss of sensitivity (0.4 μA/μM).
Considering the area under each peak (Figure 6c) instead of the peak height leads to improved linearity, but the
calibration curve remains bimodal. Nevertheless, peak height is a
much simpler measurement and is a good representation of the lower
range for our sensor, which is of more importance in our application.

Analysis of Serum for Zn
A critical challenge to detection
of Zn in serum is that two-thirds34 is
bound by protein. Thus, direct measurement is not possible, since
ASV only measures free metal ions,34 which
requires Zn to be first released from protein and then be detected
with our sensor by ASV. There are a number of options for pretreatments
of serum for electrochemical trace metal detection. Digestion of serum
is the easiest approach, and will break up proteins and release Zn
sequestered within their structure. However, we found that the commercial
product Metexchange35 originally developed
for ASV detection of Pb, did not work for Zn, most likely due to higher
binding affinity between Zn and protein.36 While the commonly used method of acidification by HCl to digest
serum worked, the results were not impressive as only spiked samples
could be measured and it was impossible to detect Zn in the original
sample.15 Thus, a more complex approach
that is able to extract metal ions from proteins and remove proteins
by phase separation is needed. Herein, we use the extraction procedure
with dithizone and trifluoroacetic acid that was reported by our collaborators,
which achieves 92–95% recovery of Zn37 in serum by stripping voltammetry.

To demonstrate Zn determination
in extracted serum, we used the standard addition approach. ASV was
performed in the extracted serum diluted 2× with acetate buffer
(0.1 M, pH 6), and samples spiked with additional 1 and 5 μM
of Zn (Figure 7a) (n = 3).
We used the same stripping parameters as in the buffer, except for
double volume of 200 μL and preconcentration time of 600 s.
Single, sharp peaks were observed in ASV voltammograms of three identical
experiments for each sample, validating the stability and capability
of Cu-based sensors for detecting Zn in extracted serum. The background
currents for water reduction of the three concentrations overlapped,
and the potentials of Zn stripping peaks were −831, −844,
and −765 mV for the original and +1 and +5 μM samples,
respectively. On the basis of our previous results using Bi WE and
Ag/AgCl RE, the several orders of magnitude differences in the chloride
concentration between acetate buffer with no chloride added and the
serum extract would lead to a positive shift of the Zn peak of several
hundred millivolts.16 However, the Zn peaks
are at approximately the same position as in the buffer while deviating
more from each other. The most likely reason for this is the stability
of the Cu/CuCl2 RE. The absence of a large positive shift
is due to the longer preconcentration time that will result in a negative
shift of the Zn peak as discussed earlier during evaluation of the
Cu/CuCl2 RE. The peak deviation shown in Figure 7a is related to the fact that CuCl2 is
much more soluble than AgCl, with a ∼105 difference
in their solubility.

Figure 7 (a) ASV of the Zn extract from bovine serum with Zn additions.
(b) Standard addition curve for measurement of Zn concentration.

We calculated the Zn concentration
in the original serum extract
using the standard addition curve (Figure 7b). The correlation equation I (μA) = 0.411
× [Zn(μM)] + 0.485 (R2 = 0.99
for 3 data points) indicates that sensitivity of the Cu-based sensor
for Zn in extracted serum is nearly 3× lower than in the buffer.
Considering the larger deviation of potentials and smaller peak amplitudes
of Zn stripping peaks, the performance of the Cu WE in extracted serum
is not as good as that in the buffer, which is attributed to a significantly
higher complexity of serum as the sample matrix. We believe the majority
of bound Zn ions were released from protein and organic ligands into
the aqueous phase during the extraction procedure, since this technique
achieves a high recovery. However, protein components can adsorb on
the WE and interfere with the electrode process for Zn determination,
which leads to decreased signal current and sensitivity. Nevertheless,
we successfully determined the concentration of Zn in blood serum
to be 14.8 ± 1.8 μM, using the Cu-based sensor. The same
samples were tested in separate ASV experiments using the Bi WE sensor,
leading to a comparable value of 12.8 ± 2.2 μM Zn.16 Our Cu-based sensor exhibited the ability to
measure Zn at much lower concentrations than the ∼20 μM
result reported previously by Kruusma et al.18 using boron-doped diamond or by Kumar et al.38 who used a hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE) for measurements
in the 49–63 μM range. ICP-MS techniques have been reported
to detect Zn with a LOD = 61 nM (4.0 ppb) in whole blood or serum
by Barany et al.39 Although our miniaturized
Cu-based voltammetric sensors are unable to match the precision and
limits of detection of modern spectroscopic and mass spectrometry
techniques, the measurements that they are able to do are in the physiologically
relevant range, and using low-cost materials with simple fabrication,
which is more favorable for disposable sensors.

Conclusions
We developed the first Cu-based sensor for ASV and demonstrated
the detection of Zn in buffer and extracted serum. Several features
make this sensor ideally suited for POC applications. First, Cu is
a low-cost electrode material compared to gold or platinum. Though
Cu is not a commonly used material for electrochemical systems since
it can easily oxidize, preconcentration in ASV helps to maintain the
Cu WE in its original metallic state by applying a negative potential.
We also demonstrated that the Cu-based sensor with a Cu/CuCl2 reference electrode was stable enough for ASV with a preconcentration
time as long as 600 s. Thus, the Cu-based sensors are qualified to
be the low-cost disposable sensors for POC instruments. Second, the
microfabrication procedure of the Cu-based sensor is quite simple.
Microfabrication offers the potential for mass production, which can
further reduce the cost of the sensor. Simple fabrication also helps
to reduce the variations among individual sensors, which is crucial
for disposable applications. Third, Cu-based sensors offer competitive
performance in electrochemical detection. By optimizing experimental
parameters, the Cu-based sensor exhibits low LOD of 140 nM (9.0 ppb
or 0.90 μg/dL), good sensitivity of more than 1 μA/μM,
and good linearity in the range below 5 μM. In experiments with
extracted serum samples, good quality peaks were observed that can
be used to quantify the concentration of Zn using the standard addition
approach.

On the other hand, there are also limitations for
this sensor.
Since the potential window is limited by the oxidation of Cu, Cu-based
sensors could only detect those metals that reduce at more negative
potentials such as Pb, Cd, and Zn, excluding metals which reduce at
more positive potentials, such as As and Ag. A potential solution
for this limitation is to electroplate another electrode material
on top of Cu in order to extend the potential window without the high
costs introduced by metal evaporation. The second limitation is that,
compared to bismuth-coated carbon-based electrodes,40−45 the LOD of the Cu-based sensor is still high, although this could
be explained by the considerably reduced sample volume and smaller
working electrode area. Third, the behavior of sensors in serum extraction
samples is still not favorable. The Cu-based sensor is not as robust
as carbon-based electrodes in that its behavior is highly dependent
on the chemicals used in the extraction procedure. Cu can react with
some commonly used acids like sulfuric acid so the chemicals involved
have to be well-controlled.

In the future, we envision initial
applications in clinics or hospitals,
with the test administered by nurses. In such an occupational setting
simple sample preparation steps are acceptable. The current method
of ASV, and the experimental settings described here are already more
convenient, faster, and less expensive as compared to the conventional
ICP-MS measurements where samples are sent to a central laboratory
facility. However, we are planning to develop an on-chip sample processing
system that would be integrated by microfluidics with the ASV technique
as a good long-term solution to the sample preparation issue.
