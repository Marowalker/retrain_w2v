In
this work, we report on the development of a palladium-based,
microfabricated point-of-care electrochemical sensor for the determination
of manganese using square wave cathodic stripping voltammetry. Heavy
metals require careful monitoring, yet current methods are too complex
for a point-of-care system. Voltammetry offers an attractive approach
to metal detection on the microscale, but traditional carbon, gold,
or platinum electrodes are difficult or expensive to microfabricate,
preventing widespread use. Our sensor uses palladium working and auxiliary
electrodes and integrates them with a copper-based reference electrode
for simple fabrication and compatibility with microfabrication and
printed circuit board processing, while maintaining competitive performance
in electrochemical detection. Copper electrodes were prepared on glass
substrate using a combination of microfabrication procedures followed
by electrodeposition of palladium. The disposable sensor system was
formed by bonding a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) well to the glass
substrate. Cathodic stripping voltammetry of manganese using our new
disposable palladium-based sensors exhibited 334 nM (18.3 ppb) limit
of detection in borate buffer. The sensor was used to demonstrate
manganese determination in natural water samples from a pond in Burnet
Woods, located in Cincinnati, OH, and the Ohio River.

Monitoring
manganese (Mn) in
the environment has become increasingly important because of greater
use in various products and better understanding of its adverse effects
on health. Mn is an essential element that is critical to metabolism
due to its involvement in enzyme activation; yet, it is toxic in high
concentrations1,2 and has been associated with development
of Parkinson’s disease3−5 and impaired neurological function
in children.6,7 Natural water, the atmosphere,
and soil are all sources of Mn exposure, which vary widely in concentration.
The most commonly acknowledged anthropogenic sources of Mn include
mining, production and refining of Mn alloys, and steel production.8−10 Apart from industry, agricultural cultivation, fertilizer, and use
of fungicides, such as maneb and mancozeb,11 are also potential sources for human exposure. Other concerns include
the manganese-based additive methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl
(MMT)12,13 that replaced lead (Pb) in gasoline as an
antiknock agent, and Mn use in rechargeable cell phone batteries.14 According to the toxicological profile for Mn
issued by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, the
highest acceptable level of Mn is only 50 ppb (0.91 μM)15 for drinking water. A recent case reported elevated
biological concentration of Mn in blood, hair, and urine of a 10 year
old child; the only identified source was from the residence’s
well water (1.21 ppm).16 Thus, there is
a growing need for analytical methods that can be used to precisely
monitor the concentration of Mn at low levels in a variety of media
from drinking water to bodily fluids in humans.

The conventional
methods for determining Mn are based on atomic
absorption spectroscopy (AAS) or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
(ICPMS). These methods provide high accuracy and sensitivity, but
suffer from a number of disadvantages. The bulky instrument, severe
delays in turn-around time due to shipping to a centralized lab, requirement
for specialized personnel, and expensive cost all prevent these techniques
from being applied in point-of-care (POC) measurements. Electrochemical
techniques, such as stripping voltammetry,17,18 offer a viable option with more rapid analysis, simpler instrumentation,
and lower cost, which is more suitable for POC applications. And,
it is capable of limits of detection (LODs) in the sub-part-per-billion
(μg/L) range. Stripping voltammetry involves a preconcentration
step during which the working electrode is biased at a certain potential
until an adequate amount of target analyte has been deposited at the
electrode and a stripping step to remove the deposited analyte from
the electrode surface while generating a faradaic current that is
related to the analyte concentration in the sample.

Anodic stripping
voltammetry (ASV) has been considered as the most
widespread, trace-level electrochemical sensing technique,19 which defines the preconcentration step to happen
at a potential to reduce target analyte, and the stripping step scanning
in the positive direction to strip the deposited analyte by oxidation
giving anodic current that is measured for quantification. However,
ASV is challenging for Mn determination because the very negative
potential needed to reduce Mn ions does not fit the negative potential
working ranges of most solid electrodes. Previous measurements of
Mn using Bi or carbon nanotube (CNT) electrodes4,5,20 produced distorted voltammograms and obscure
peaks because the Mn stripping peak occurs at a very negative potential
which is close to the reduction potential of H+. Thus,
an alternative approach to circumvent the interference from H+ reduction current is needed for reliable and accurate determination
of Mn at the low concentrations required for practical applications.

Cathodic stripping voltammetry (CSV) is an alternative approach
to ASV that offers a number of advantages for determining Mn. CSV
is the electrochemical reverse of ASV and is performed by preconcentrating
at a potential to oxidize aqueous ions to insoluble oxides that deposit
on the electrode, followed by stripping in the negative potential
direction to reduce them back to the soluble ionic form giving cathodic
current that is measured for quantification. Figure 1a illustrates the key steps for CSV of Mn, with trace Mn(II)
being oxidized to Mn(IV) which hydrolyzes into insoluble manganese
dioxide or hydrate on the electrode surface. Compared with ASV, the
CSV approach is less susceptible to oxygen and intermetallic interferences.
Also, a large selection of common electrode materials is available
for CSV. Apart from mercury,21 which is
toxic and not environmentally friendly, this approach has been used
with platinum,22−25 glassy carbon or carbon film,26−28 graphite,29 CNT,5,30 or boron-doped diamond electrodes.4,31 Despite the stable performance and low detection limits on some
of these materials, miniaturization and integration of such electrodes
into POC sensor systems remain challenging.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic diagram
of CSV of Mn on an electroplated Pd electrode
showing the preconcentration step to oxidize Mn(II) into Mn(IV) which
forms a layer of MnO2 on the surface of the Pd WE, and
the stripping step to reduce Mn(IV) back to Mn(II) off from the electrode.
(b) Photograph of the sensor. (c) A close-up of the electrodes: Pd
WE and AE, Cu/CuCl2 RE (WE = working electrode, RE = reference
electrode, AE = auxiliary electrode).

Herein, we discuss the use of the copper (Cu)-based sensor
we reported
recently32 for determination of Mn by CSV.
The copper-based sensor presents a good platform for POC determination
of metals, with demonstrated excellent performance for ASV determination
of zinc and lead. However, the Cu working electrode (WE) is not suitable
for Mn determination by either form of stripping voltammetry due to
insufficient potential range. It lacks the negative potential range
needed for ASV of Mn, and it is not suitable for CSV of Mn either
because its oxidation at positive potentials prevents formation of
Mn(IV) in the deposition step. Thus, to broaden the potential window
and protect electrodes from degradation by oxidation, we electrodeposited
a thin layer of palladium (Pd) on both the Cu WE and the Cu auxiliary
electrode (AE) as shown in the close-up photograph of the sensor electrodes
in Figure 1c. However, to simplify fabrication,
we continue to use the Cu/CuCl2 reference electrode (RE),
which we previously showed to offer sufficiently stable performance
in anodic stripping for disposable sensors. The Pd WE sensor exhibits
favorable response for Mn in pH 9.0, 0.1 M borate buffer with a detection
limit of 334 nM (18.3 ppb). Using the sensor in a standard addition
approach, we successfully measured 1.74 μM (95.5 ppb) Mn in
sample of water from the Ohio River. This work showcases the flexibility
of the copper-based sensor design, which can be easily modified by
simple coating of the working electrode. This is also the first demonstration
of Mn determination by CSV on a microscale sensor. Ultimately, with
additional integration of miniaturized potentiostat electronics, a
portable sensor system capable of Mn determination in water samples
is envisioned.

Experimental Section
Reagents
Reagents
were prepared from chemicals purchased
from Thermo Fisher Scientific, unless noted otherwise. Piranha solution
was prepared from H2SO4 and H2O2 in 7:3 (v/v) ratio. Copper etchant was prepared from H2O2, H2SO4, and deionized
(DI) water in 1:1:10 (v/v/v) ratio. Titanium etchant was prepared
from HNO3, HF, and DI water in 1:2:7 (v/v/v) ratio. Palladium
electroplating solution was purchased from Technic Inc. (PALLASPEED
RTU). A 1 M borate buffer was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. A 0.1
M borate buffer was prepared by dilution of the commercial buffer
with DI water. Borate buffers with pH from 8.0 to 9.75 were prepared
by addition of NaOH(s) to the diluted commercial buffer. Solutions
containing 25–600 ppb (455 nM to 10.9 μM) Mn were prepared
by diluting Mn stock solution (TraceCERT, 1000 mg/L Mn2+ in 2% nitric acid, Fluka Analytical) with borate buffer.

Sensor
Fabrication
The fabrication procedures for the
palladium-coated Cu electrochemical sensor include a single photolithography
step, followed by two electrodeposition steps. Metal layers of 20
nm of titanium (Ti)/200 nm Cu were then evaporated (Temescal FC-1800
E-Beam evaporator) onto glass substrates cleaned in Piranha solution.
An etch mask of ∼2 μm was formed using photolithography
with Shipley 1818 photoresist and developer 351. The three-electrode
patterns with contact pads were formed by wet etching in Cu etchant
for 10 s followed by Ti etchant for 3 s, with 1 min of rinse in DI
water after each etching step. A polymer well with ∼9 mm diameter
and 3 mm thickness was fabricated in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)
using the standard soft lithography process. It was bonded to a clean
glass substrate containing the electrode patterns using plasma discharge
(BD-20AC, Electo-Technic Products Inc.) after 20 s of treatment on
the PDMS surface only. An interface consisting of an edge-board connector
(EBC05DRAS, Sullins) and a mini-USB port were soldered on a printed
circuit board to simplify and improve connection between the sensor
and the potentiostat. The surface area for the WE, RE, and AE are
0.019, 0.023, and 0.139 cm2, respectively. The Pd WE and
AE were formed by deposition of Pd at 5 mA/cm2 cathodic
current for 90 s with a Pt wire AE to sustain the current. The Cu/CuCl2 RE was fabricated by chloridizing Cu in 1 M KCl with a 3
mA/cm2 anodic current for 30 s.

Samples
We chose
two natural water samples to analyze
using our sensor. The pond water sample was collected from Burnet
Woods pond (Cincinnati, OH, August 9, 2013). River water sample was
collected from the Ohio River (Newport, KY shore, November 30, 2012).
Both samples were collected in conical tubes (Falcon 15 mL conical
centrifuge tubes), at least 10 mL volume. Samples were diluted with
0.2 M borate buffer (pH 9.0) by a factor of 2, which yielded pH 8.96.
Samples were analyzed immediately upon completion of dilution using
the method of standard additions discussed below.

Electrochemical
Experiments
A miniature USB potentiostat
(WaveNow, Pine Instruments, Inc.) with AfterMath Data Organizer software
was used for all electrochemical measurements. A sensor was inserted
into the interface and connected to the potentiostat using a mini-USB
cable. The sample volume was 100 μL for all the experiments
in borate buffer. For the study of stability of our Cu/CuCl2 RE, we measured open circuit potential (OCP) between the Cu/CuCl2 RE and a double-junction Ag/AgCl RE (MI-401F, Microelectrodes
Inc.), which was used as a standard reference electrode. We performed
cyclic voltammetry (CV) in pH 9.0 0.1 M borate buffer to confirm the
potential window of the electrodeposited Pd electrode and the position
of the Mn reduction peak. After a series of optimizations of CSV parameters
in pH 9.0, 0.1 M borate buffer, we used the following parameters:
0.7 V as preconcentration potential with 600 s duration, stripping
range from 0.7 to −0.2 V; waveform parameters of 70 ms for
period, 4 mV for increment, and 25 mV for amplitude. Manganese from
455 nM (25 ppb) to 10.9 μM (600 ppb) in borate buffer was used
to construct the calibration curve and calculate LOD as 3σ/slope.
We used the same stripping parameters for the detection of Mn concentrations
in natural water samples, while using the method of standard addition
to determine the concentration of Mn in the original samples.

Results
and Discussion
Novel Pd WE Sensor
Our previous
work20,33 demonstrated a miniature electrochemical
sensor with a Bi WE for
determination of Mn, which exhibits a very negative stripping potential.
The sensor was approximately 15 × 19 mm2, required
only microliters of sample, and performed an analysis in less than
15 min. Although the Bi WE performed reasonably well, with LOD = 5
μM, the shape of the stripping peak was not ideal and it occurred
on the shoulder of H+ reduction current despite optimization
efforts. In addition, the fabrication procedure for these electrodes
was complex and costly, requiring multiple photolithography, e-beam
evaporation, and lift-off process steps.

To address the aforementioned
shortcomings of the Bi WE sensors, we developed a sensor for cathodic
stripping of Mn based on a Pd thin film. We used Pd due to its similarity
with Pt and the ability to offer stable performance at the positive
potential used for the preconcentration step in CSV of Mn.34−38 Pt offers stable performance, but the high cost and difficulties
in fabrication make it less desirable for disposable devices. The
commonly used Au exhibits a reduction peak that overlaps with the
cathodic stripping peak of Mn. Ultimately, Pd offers a sufficiently
wide potential window for CSV of Mn, and at a substantially lower
cost.

Fabrication of our new Pd WE sensor is based on the Cu
thin-film
electrochemical cell we introduced recently specifically for POC applications.32 Our sensor consists of a Pd WE, a Pd AE, and
a Cu/CuCl2 RE, as illustrated in Figure 1b. To simplify fabrication, the Pd layer for the WE and AE
was electrodeposited on top of a patterned Cu seed layer. In prior
work we used this Cu seed layer for direct determination of metals
with mildly negative stripping potentials, such as Zn.32 Here, however, the Cu WE proved to be inadequate
for determining Mn as its potential window was simply not sufficiently
negative to permit anodic stripping of Mn or sufficiently positive
for cathodic stripping of Mn. For the RE, using Cu/CuCl2 can further simplify fabrication and eliminate the additional step
of electroplating silver in the fabrication of a Ag/AgCl RE. The layout
of the electrode patterns was generally similar to our earlier work,
with a user-friendly interface that integrated an edge-board connector
and a mini-USB port to provide simplified connection and accessibility.

Pd Auxiliary Electrode
Since the AE in an electrochemical
cell must provide stable current during both preconcentration and
stripping steps, we first assessed stability of the Pd AE. In conventional
electrochemical cells, AEs are fabricated from inert materials, such
as Pt or graphite. Since Pd is a platinum group metal, we expected
it to perform similarly to Pt. We compared these two metals using
chronopotentiometry at 10 μA current, which is the typical upper
limit of current we see in cathodic stripping experiments. During
this experiment, we used a graphite electrode as the cathode, with
Pd or Pt as the anode. As expected, the Pt electrode maintained a
stable potential at about 1.3 V for the oxidation of water during
the entire 60 min experiment (Figure 2a), indicating
that it is an excellent, perfectly polarizable AE. The electrodeposited
Pd AE was also perfectly polarizable and sustained a potential of
approximately 1.1 V. This experiment showed that a thin layer of Pd
film could protect the Cu layer underneath from oxidation and ensure
reproducibility of measurements with even long preconcentration times.
Next, we examined the electrochemical performance of the Cu/CuCl2 RE.

9.0 borate buffer. (b) Comparison of the response time and stability
of the integrated Cu/CuCl2 RE vs Ag/AgCl RE in pH 9.0 borate

Cu/CuCl2 Reference
Electrode
Although we
demonstrated stability of the microfabricated Cu/CuCl2 RE
in acidic buffer in our previous work,32 herein we investigated its stability under the basic buffer conditions
necessary for CSV of Mn by comparing it with the commonly used Ag/AgCl
RE. Excessive instability of the reference electrode can lead to difficulties
in peak assignment in samples that contain mixtures of metals and
give multiple peaks, or can interfere with peak quantitation if an
incorrect deposition potential is applied. By monitoring the OCP against
a commercially available double-junction Ag/AgCl RE in pH 9.0, 0.1
M borate buffer, we observed differences between the two REs (Figure 2b). For the Cu/CuCl2 RE, this difference
compared to the commercial RE reached a stable value of 3.4 ±
9.8 mV in 306 s, while for the Ag/AgCl RE the difference was approximately
14.6 ± 3.9 mV in 68 s. This difference in the response time may
be due to differences in solubility of CuCl2 and AgCl in
pH 9.0 borate buffer.

Our previous results32 show the response times of the two REs in acetate buffer
to be 28 and 46 s, respectively, which suggests that, in basic buffer,
it takes longer for some of the chloride layer of the REs to dissolve
and stabilize the RE. To further confirm the response time of Cu/CuCl2 RE, we evaluated the potential between WE and RE during the
preconcentration step of CSV using a potentiostat and an independent
multimeter and found that the potential reached the designated value
within 8 s. The drift in the reference electrode potential can cause
quantitative and qualitative errors in data collection and analysis
beyond simple inaccuracies in the measured potential. After ∼10
min, when the potentials of both REs equilibrated, we calculated the
drift rate of our electrodes. The Cu/CuCl2 RE drifted at
a rate of ∼1.5 mV/h, while the Ag/AgCl RE drifted at ∼15.2
mV/h. These rates are higher than that of some microscale Ag/AgCl
REs reported in literature39,40 that exhibit drift
of ∼0.034 mV/h, but are lower than our previous measurements
of Cu/CuCl2 RE in saturated KCl solution (4.6 M at 20 °C)
that showed a drift rate of ∼0.3 mV/min.32 Nevertheless, the drift rate of the Cu/CuCl2 RE in borate buffer is quite low, and we believe it would be able
to provide a stable potential during the stripping step if the preconcentration
time is shorter than 10 min. The more convenient fabrication process
combined with its acceptable stability in buffer makes the integrated
Cu/CuCl2 RE an attractive option for this sensor compared
to the conventional Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Having established
that Pd AE and copper-based RE are possible, we focused on determining
if Pd can be used as a working electrode for Mn CSV.

Pd Working
Electrode
As the first step in evaluating
the Pd WE, we performed CV to evaluate the potential window of the
Pd WE and the potential of the reduction peak of manganese oxide by
scanning from −1 to 0.8 V at the rate of 100 mV/s in 0.1 M
borate buffer with different pHs. The voltammograms were carefully
examined and compared (see the Supporting Information). On the basis of these comparisons, pH 9.0 was selected because
the Mn2+ ion is not sufficiently soluble in more basic
pHs. At this pH, a flat region from 700 mV to ∼0 V can be clearly
observed, which indicates the potential range suitable for reduction
of metals.

Adding 10 ppm Mn to the buffer illustrates the reduction
peaks for Mn in the 0 to 200 mV range (Figure 3b). The Pd reduction peaks in both curves correspond to reduction
of a thin layer of palladium oxide covering the surface of the Pd
WE.41 Considering that the peaks occurred
far more negative than Mn reduction, at −170, −270,
and −600 mV for borate buffer, and −200, −300,
and −630 mV for buffer with 10 ppm Mn, we believe they would
not interfere with the stripping process of manganese oxide in CSV.
The potential range of the Pd WE in different pHs was further demonstrated
by CSV of 5 μM Mn (Figure 3c).

Figure 3 (a) CVs of
electroplated Pd WE in 0.1 M borate buffer of various
pH. (b) CV of pH 9, 0.1 M borate buffer alone and with additional
10 ppm Mn; the inset illustrates close-up of the Mn reduction peak.
(c) CSV of 5 μM Mn at different pHs of borate buffer, with the
inset illustrating the Mn stripping peak. The red arrow marks the
potential range for this Pd electrode.

We optimized the current density used for electrodeposition
of
the Pd film on WE and AE before optimizing parameters for stripping
voltammetry. On the basis of the earlier work on electrodeposition
of Pd42,43 and the information provided by the manufacturer
of the plating solution, we defined the range of deposition current
from 700 μA to 1 mA (∼4.4–6.3 mA/cm2, since the total surface area of WE + AE = 0.158 cm2).
Four values of plating current were evaluated (Figure 4a) according to the film thickness, surface morphologies,
and most importantly, peak shape and amplitude of the Mn stripping
voltammograms, by performing CSV in a 100 μL sample with 5 μM
Mn. The average thickness of the Pd film was ∼100 ± 10
nm for all four currents, while the surface roughness varied according
to plating current.

of Pd: (a)
CSV peak current (ordinate) of 5 μM Mn with electrode deposited
by four plating currents (abscissa), while the inset illustrates their
surface condition. (b) Optical profiler scans and (c) SEM of Pd electrode
deposited with 800 μA current.

Although 1 mA current generated a slightly thicker film,
hydrogen
embrittlement occurred causing higher surface roughness of ∼8.0
± 4.2 nm and a burned appearance on the film.42,44 Also, the film exhibited stress that led to curled edges that tended
to peel off even with delicate handling. Thus, the Mn stripping signal
was small and had a large variation (Figure 4a). The Pd film generated by 900 μA current suffered from the
same issue as 1 mA, only to a smaller extent with a roughness of 2.3
± 1.4 nm. The film quality improved as the current decreased
to 800 μA, which no longer showed burned spots and the surface
roughness was reduced to 1.4 ± 0.8 nm. The current of 700 μA
seemed not enough since the film roughness increased to 4.0 ±
2.2 nm, and a faint pink color suggested only partial coverage of
the Cu substrate. While the Mn peak from electrodes plated by 700 μA
current provided acceptable amplitude, the variability was not favorable.
The results from Mn stripping and their reproducibility in Figure 4a illustrate 800 μA (∼5.1 mA/cm2) to be the optimal value of current, based on the largest
signal amplitude and small variation. Figure 4, parts b and c, shows a smooth Pd film on electrodes deposited by
800 μA current. With the deposition parameter finalized, we
examined the buffer condition for preconcentration of Mn.

Optimization
of CSV Parameters
To further explore the
electrochemical characteristics of the Pd WE sensor, we investigated
the effect of buffer pH on the stripping of Mn. CSV was performed
in 0.1 M borate buffers with pHs in the 8–9.75 range. As results
in Figure 5a demonstrate, for pH = 8 buffer
no detectable Mn was observed because the solution was too acidic
for manganese oxide to form or remain stable. Although it was possible
to measure Mn at pH 8.5, the voltammograms suffered from substantial
signal noise, which led to significant variability. More basic pH
≥ 9 provided a suitable environment for the formation of MnO2, but no distinct differences could be observed from the voltammograms.
Since Mn2+ precipitates easily in buffer pH > 10, we
chose
pH 9.0 which gave the largest peak amplitude and best reproducibility.

Figure 5 Optimization
of parameters for CSV of Mn by comparisons of the
amplitude and reproducibility of the Mn cathodic stripping peak in
5 μM Mn in pH 9.0, 0.1 M borate buffer solution: (a) pH of borate
buffer; (b) preconcentration potential; (c) preconcentration time.

The preconcentration step is critical
in any stripping technique,
and thus we optimized this step for CSV. The preconcentration potential
was varied from 0.6 to 0.9 V with intervals of 0.1 V. As results in
Figure 5b show a potential of 0.6 V was too
negative to maximize oxidation of Mn2+; thus, the amplitude
of the manganese oxide reduction peak was rather small. The peak amplitude
was improved at potentials more positive than 0.6 V, but Pd oxidation
became predominant above 0.8 V, and the peak we observed on the voltammograms
shifted from ∼300 to 650 mV, due to reduction of a largely
increased amount of palladium oxide. Thus, we chose 0.7 V as the optimum
potential for generating a sufficiently large amount of manganese
oxide for detection without causing problems with peak height measurement
because of the interfering palladium oxide reduction wave.

We
evaluated the effect of preconcentration time on sensitivity
(Figure 5c) to find the minimum time for adequate
sensitivity (i.e., substantial depletion of metal ion from the sample).
We observed the usual increase in Mn peak amplitude with deposition
time as more Mn from the sample was deposited on the WE. The coefficients
of variation of the stripping peak for 5 and 10 min were both 11%,
illustrating that 5 and 10 min could generate reproducible voltammograms.
This high degree of reproducibility illustrates an excellent performance
for a disposable sensor. But at 15 min it dramatically increased to ∼39%,
suggesting a major change in the condition of the WE. We found that
the thin Pd film was not sufficiently thick to protect the underlying
Cu layer for such a long deposition time during which some Pd was
being oxidized. We observed gradual peeling at the edges of the Pd
film on both the WE and the AE which exposed Cu, making it available
for oxidation at the deposition potential and disrupting Mn preconcentration.
Under agitation, the Pd film was easily removed, leaving only the
20 nm of Ti seed layer to sustain the current. This created a sudden
increase in resistance that was accompanied by disintegration of the
WE, and the sensor could no longer perform the experiment and had
to be discarded. Consequently, we chose 10 min for the preconcentration
time to maximize the stripping peak for Mn while consistently avoiding
this problem with WE durability. A shorter preconcentration time may
be possible in the future if agitation of the sample is improved,
for example, by using an acoustic transducer.49

Optimum waveform parameters for stripping by square wave (SW)
voltammetry
were found to be the default Osteryoung settings45 of 25 mV amplitude, 70 ms period, and 4 mV increment. Varying
the waveform parameters sometimes increased the peak height, but always
tended to distort the voltammograms, broaden the peaks, or even create
huge peaks in the background, making it challenging to accurately
quantify the Mn peak current. Therefore, we used the default values
for Osteryoung square wave voltammetry.

Calibration in Borate Buffer
Following optimization
of experimental and stripping waveform parameters, a calibration curve
was constructed by performing CSV in 100 μL of borate buffer
(0.1 M, pH 9.0) with 25–600 ppb (455 nM to 10.9 μM) of
Mn spiked, as shown in Figure 6. This range
brackets the range of Mn in environmental samples, while illustrating
that the LOD of the sensor allows for multifold dilution, if necessary.
For most concentrations, we repeated experiments three times (n = 3) using a new disposable sensor each time to obtain
the standard deviation σ (n = 7 was used for
the lowest Mn concentration). Representative stripping voltammograms
over the entire 500 nM to 10.9 μM concentration range are shown
in Figure 6a.

M borate buffer for the
25–600 ppb (455 nM to 10.9 μM) range: (a) stripping voltammograms
of Mn; (b) calibration curve plotted after baseline subtraction. Sample
volume, 100 μL; preconcentration potential, 0.7 V; preconcentration
time, 600 s; period, 70 ms; increment, 4 mV; amplitude, 25 mV.

The Mn peak occurred at 212–216
mV in Mn concentrations
from 150–600 ppb, and shifted to ∼226 mV in 50–100
ppb Mn levels, then shifted further to ∼270 mV when Mn concentration
dropped to 25 ppb. Since a minor peak at 381 ± 16 mV in the borate
buffer background voltammogram (black) could be observed, it is believed
to be due to palladium oxide only. Thus, we attribute the positive
shift of peak potential that accompanies decreasing of Mn levels to
the interference of a minute amount of palladium oxide formed on top
of the Pd electrode, which tends to compete with the formation of
manganese oxide for WE surface area. This has been a common issue
with solid electrodes. As we gradually increased Mn levels, the reduction
of manganese oxide surpassed the reduction of palladium oxide and
then Mn stripping became predominant and the peak shifted to ∼220
mV. We have previously observed similar concentration-related peak
migration in ASV of Zn using a Bi WE,33 which was also caused by modification to the electrode surface and
could cause resolution issues in the lower concentration range of
the analyte.

After we obtained the voltammograms, a baseline
subtraction method
was used to remove the interference of the minor wave present in the
background voltammograms to ensure the accuracy of readouts of Mn
peak amplitude. This approach involves first creating a virtual average
curve of several actual background curves (n = 4)
generated in pH 9.0, 0.1 M borate buffer using a new sensor each time
and then subtracting this virtual curve from each original voltammogram.
The resulting voltammograms then exhibited the reduction peak of manganese
oxide only. After baseline subtraction, clean Mn peak amplitudes were
measured to plot the calibration curve and to calculate detection
limit.

The resulting calibration curve (Figure 6b) exhibited a strong linear relationship between peak current
of
Mn stripping and Mn concentration. The correlation equation was I (μA) = (0.106(±0.006))([Mn (μM)]) + 0.102(±0.028) (R2 =
0.986 for 7 data points). The sensor exhibited good sensitivity 0.106
μA/μM (5.575 μA/μM/cm2 when normalized to WE area). The detection limit was calculated
to be LOD = 334 nM (18.3 ppb) based on 3σ/slope (n = 7). Measurements of Mn using bulk electrodes reported by Banks
et al.4 showed a 740 nM LOD using ASV on
a boron-doped diamond electrode, while Yue et al.5 reported 120 and 93 nM LODs for ASV and CSV using a metal
catalyst free CNT electrode. Compared with these bulk electrodes,
our Pd microelectrode is able to provide competitive performance and
yet more convenient measurements.

Determination of Water
Manganese
To demonstrate performance
of our sensor in environmental samples, we chose samples of water
from the Ohio River and a pond in Burnet Woods, OH as representative
natural water samples. We first tested pond water and spiked it with
Mn (see the Supporting Information), since
water from this pond was previously examined by AAS and CSV and showed
no detectable Mn.5 We spiked 73.6 ppb of
Mn into the sample, measured 71.3 ± 8.7 ppb of Mn using the standard addition method. This demonstrates
accuracy of 97% with 17% precision (n = 3). This
experiment demonstrates the capability of our Pd WE to accurately
determine concentrations of Mn in a natural water sample.

On
the basis of the performance in a spiked water sample, we used our
sensor to determine unknown Mn concentration in a river water sample.
We also diluted the sample with pH 9.0, 0.2 M borate buffer by a factor
of 2×. The standard addition method was again applied, using
50, 100, and 200 ppb of additional Mn. The voltammograms in Figure 7a illustrate the peak potentials of different concentrations
of Mn to be 296, 196, 156, and 184 mV, respectively, showing the RE
was influenced by the water sample matrix as well. They follow the
migration profile related to Mn levels as discussed in previous sections.
Since the amplitude of the Mn peak of the unspiked sample remains
slightly obscure which suggested the need for baseline subtraction,
we applied the same treatment to these voltammograms. According to
Figure 7b, the correlation equation is I (μA) = (0.126(±0.011))([Mn
(μM)]) + 0.110(±0.023) (R2 = 0.984 for 4 data points). We calculated the Mn concentration
using the equation above while considering the dilution factor. The
Mn concentration in Ohio River was determined as 1.74 ±
0.49 μM (95.4 ± 27.0 ppb),
which is in the range of Mn present in surface waters (typically 1
ppb to 1 ppm46−48).

Figure 7 Determination of Mn in spiked Ohio River water using SWCSV
and
the standard addition method. Samples were diluted 2× with 0.2
M borate buffer pH 9.0 and for standard addition of 50–200
ppb Mn. (a) Voltammograms of spiked sample and four additions of Mn
standards and (b) standard addition curve after baseline subtraction.

In environmental samples, the
potentially interfering species present
in the sample can be broadly divided into nonelectroactive and electroactive
components. The nonelectroactive components do not participate in
the preconcentration and stripping of Mn, and thus do not impact sensor
performance. The electroactive metal components, such as Fe2+, Fe3+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, As3+, Se4+, can exist in any sample matrix. However, most of these species
have very specific reduction/oxidation potentials and are not likely
to interfere with Mn due to difference in the stripping potential.
Also, previous work by Saterlay et al.31 indicated that Zn2+, Cu2+, Pb2+, and Fe3+ have no measurable effect for Mn determination.
Recent work by Banks et al.4 and Locatelli
and Torsi21 independently confirmed that
the only considerable interference in such measurements could be due
to Fe2+, and that CSV is highly selective toward Mn. Thus,
CSV is ideally suited for complex environmental samples such as those
reported herein.

Conclusions
We demonstrated a palladium-based
electrochemical sensor for CSV
and demonstrated the determination of Mn in buffer and environmental
water samples. Compared with ASV, CSV is a viable alternative for
detecting metals whose reduction potentials are too negative for the
potential window of common WEs in ASV. This work also showcases the
flexibility of our copper-based sensor platform, which can be easily
modified by simple coating of the WE surface. To our knowledge, this
is also the first demonstration of Mn determination by CSV on a microscale
sensor.

Several features make this sensor ideally suited for
POC applications.
First, Pd is a relatively low-cost electrode material compared to
Au or Pt. Though Pd is not a commonly used material for electroanalytical
systems, it provides stable potential as AE and sufficient potential
window for CSV of Mn as WE. We also demonstrated that the sensor with
a Cu/CuCl2 RE was sufficiently stable for CSV with a preconcentration
time as long as 600 s. Thus, the sensors are qualified to be low-cost
disposable sensors for POC instruments. Second, the microfabrication
procedure of our palladium-based sensor is relatively simple. Microfabrication
offers the potential for mass production, which can further reduce
the cost of the sensor. Simple fabrication also helps to reduce the
device-to-device variation, leading to relatively low 11% variability.
This advantage is crucial for POC applications where disposable sensors
are used, as it becomes possible to minimize errors introduced through
sensor manufacturing.

Finally, the sensor offers competitive
performance for electrochemical
determination of Mn. By optimizing experimental parameters, the sensor
exhibits LOD = 334 nM (18.3 ppb), good sensitivity of 0.106 μA/μM
(5.575 μA/μM/cm2 normalized to WE
area), and good linearity in the 455 nM to 10.9 μM range. This
is a significant improvement in performance compared with our previous
work. In experiments with water samples, good quality peaks were observed
that can be used to quantify the concentration of Mn using the method
of standard additions. Ultimately, while our miniaturized palladium-based
voltammetric sensors are unable to match the precision and limits
of detection of modern spectroscopic and mass spectrometry techniques,
the measurements that they are able to do are in the relevant range
and use low-cost materials with simple fabrication, which is more
favorable for disposable sensors.
