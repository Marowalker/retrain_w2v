Lipoprotein
profiling of human blood by 1H nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a rapid and promising approach to
monitor health and disease states in medicine and nutrition. However,
lack of standardization of measurement protocols has prevented the
use of NMR-based lipoprotein profiling in metastudies. In this study,
a standardized NMR measurement protocol was applied in a ring test
performed across three different laboratories in Europe on plasma
and serum samples from 28 individuals. Data was evaluated in terms
of (i) spectral differences, (ii) differences in LPD predictions obtained
using an existing prediction model, and (iii) agreement of predictions
with cholesterol concentrations in high- and low-density lipoproteins
(HDL and LDL) particles measured by standardized clinical assays.
ANOVA-simultaneous component analysis (ASCA) of the ring test spectral
ensemble that contains methylene and methyl peaks (1.4–0.6
ppm) showed that 97.99% of the variance in the data is related to
subject, 1.62% to sample type (serum or plasma), and 0.39% to laboratory.
This interlaboratory variation is in fact smaller than the maximum
acceptable intralaboratory variation on quality control samples. It
is also shown that the reproducibility between laboratories is good
enough for the LPD predictions to be exchangeable when the standardized
NMR measurement protocol is followed. With the successful implementation
of this protocol, which results in reproducible prediction of lipoprotein
distributions across laboratories, a step is taken toward bringing
NMR more into scope of prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers, reducing
the need for less efficient methods such as ultracentrifugation or
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

==== Body
In the postgenomic
era, metabolomics
plays a key role in life sciences as the real-time downstream manifestation
of the genomic potential of an organism. The numbers of biological studies that involve metabolomics are
increasing. Despite being an informative and promising approach, metabolomics
is still considered to be a nonstandardized method of analysis. Indeed,
methodologies and protocols used in metabolomics of a single organism
differ between laboratories and projects, which in turn leads to data
incompatibility and a lack of knowledge due to lack of standardization.
It is therefore crucial to introduce optimized and standardized metabolomics
protocols in order to map the metabolomes of organisms in a reproducible
way. Since high-resolution NMR spectroscopy was first applied to human
blood,1 it has become one of the most widely
used analytical platforms in metabolomics for studying human blood
plasma and serum of large cohorts.2 Many
studies have identified human disease biomarkers3 and dietary effects on human health using NMR-based metabolomics
on blood and urine.4 Recent developments
on standardization and optimization of NMR-based metabolomics protocols
for human biofluids further enhanced the throughput and reproducibility
of the methods.5,6 NMR spectroscopy allows simultaneous
detection of a wide range (50–70) of structurally diverse metabolites
from human plasma or serum.4,7−10 Despite the fact that mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods are more
sensitive, with several hundreds of detectable metabolites within
a single run, NMR spectroscopy outperforms the MS-based methods in
terms of its high reproducibility, speed, and ability to quantify
metabolites in an absolute manner without cumbersome calibration procedures.3 Hence, NMR spectroscopy has established itself
as a reliable tool for quantification of the human blood plasma and
serum metabolome in a high-throughput manner.2 The latter fact indeed places NMR as a method of choice for large
international cohorts involving thousands of measurements over several
years.2

NMR has one more overlooked
advantage, namely, that it is nondestructive
and allows for measurement of a sample as is. This makes NMR a unique
platform for investigating lipoproteins since it can assess size and
density of these supramolecular aggregates in their intact form. This
is a considerable advantage over other omics platforms which typically
only consider the molecular composition of biofluids. Lipoprotein
particles are supramolecular triglyceride and cholesterol transport
vehicles in blood and can be divided into four main groups on the
basis of their density and size: very low density lipoproteins (VLDL),
intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), low-density lipoproteins
(LDL), and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). The lipoprotein particles
can be further separated into subgroups and large chylomicrons.11 Their determination provides valuable information,
as they constitute key biomarkers and risk factors of cardiovascular
diseases and portray the complex link between obesity and disease.12,13 Unfortunately, detailed determination of lipoprotein particle distributions
(LPDs) relies on time-consuming, complex, and inefficient separation-based
methodologies such as ultracentrifugation (UC)14 or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).15 Density gradient ultracentrifugation can separate
lipoprotein classes within 2–5 days with coefficients of variation
(CVs) ranging from 3% to 9% (+4% in the HDL class),12 or within an hour with between-run CV ranging from 1.34%
to 5.89% with the Vertical Auto Profiling method,16 while HPLC methods can do it in 30 min with CV ranging
from 0.3% to 4.5%.17 NMR measurement (1D
NOESY) reduces run time to 16 min (4 min for acquisition and 12 min
for sample exchange, including temperature equilibration, autotuning,
and matching) with CV 0–10% in low molecular weight metabolites.18

Therefore, determination of LPD from NMR
spectra is desirable.
Previous studies have successfully achieved this by extracting relevant
information from the complex methylene (CH2) and methyl
(CH3) signals in the 1.4–0.6 ppm region of the NMR
spectra.2,9,19 So far most
large-scale studies on variation of LPDs were carried out at a single
NMR center. In order to allow for distributed analysis at multiple
NMR laboratories, good interlaboratory reproducibility is a prerequisite.
Previous studies have addressed this issue on low molecular weight
metabolites and large biomolecules,6,18,20,21 but to the best of
our knowledge, there is no study that focuses on interlaboratory variation
and reproducibility in such large entities (supramolecular complexes)
as lipoprotein particles.

The present study focuses on the implementation
of a protocol and
methodology that represents the latest technological development in
NMR spectroscopy for a large-scale, interlaboratory, quantitative,
reproducible, and high-throughput phenotyping of human blood plasma
and serum with the aim to reliably predict lipoprotein particle distributions
using NMR measurements from different laboratories. This NMR metabolomics
protocol largely relies on controlled sample preparation, sample handling,
data acquisition, and data processing using standardization of parameters.
The protocol includes several control levels, including measurement
temperature control within 0.1 K and spectral correction using ERETIC
(Electronic REference To access In vivo Concentrations) signal equivalent
to 10 mM proton. The standardized NMR protocol was applied in a ring
test performed across three different laboratories in Europe for both
plasma and serum samples obtained from the same individuals at the
same time (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information). The ring test study enabled evaluation of the developed protocol
for the quality and reproducibility of the data from three different
laboratories to estimate several clinically important parameters of
blood samples, including total cholesterol content in HDL and LDL.
The NMR spectra from the three laboratories was investigated and scrutinized
in terms of (1) spectral differences, (2) differences in the LPD predictions
obtained using an existing prediction model,9 and (3) agreement of these predictions with experimentally obtained
standard clinical parameters.

Materials and Methods
Experimental Design
Fasting plasma and serum samples
of 30 adults were investigated at three different laboratories: University
of Copenhagen (Frederiksberg, Denmark, labeled KU), Bruker BioSpin
(Rheinstetten, Germany, labeled BR), and Unilever (Vlaardingen, Netherlands,
labeled UL). After an overnight fasting (>10 h), blood samples
were
drawn and blood plasma and serum were separated. Aliquot fractions
of blood plasma and serum were kept in the freezer (−80 °C)
until shipped to the three laboratories in dry ice for 1D 1H NMR analysis. Clinical measurements were taken for each participant.

Participants
Apparently healthy participants of both
genders were selected based on the following inclusion criteria: >20
years old, body mass index (kg/m2) between 18.5 and 40.
Pregnant or lactating women (up to 6 weeks prior to study start),
as well as subjects diagnosed with any form of cardiovascular disease
or diabetes, reporting chronic gastrointestinal disorders, receiving
antibiotic treatment within 3 months of starting the study, or using
pre- or probiotic supplements within 1 month of starting the study,
were not considered suitable candidates. All subjects were recruited
in Copenhagen, via press announcements and online recruitment homepages.
Elderly participants were also recruited via specific journals and
social media platforms. All participants provided a written consent
to participate in the study. The study was conducted at the Department
of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports at the University of Copenhagen,
Denmark, and was approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the
Capital Region of Denmark in accordance with the Helsinki declaration
(H-15008313) and the Danish Data Protection Agency (2013-54-0522).

NMR Sample Preparations
Plasma and serum samples were
stored in cryovials at −80 °C until measurement day. Prior
to preparation, they were thawed at room temperature for approximately
half an hour. Respective aliquots of 350 μL were carefully mixed
with equal amounts of phosphate buffer solution22 in cryovials, and then transferred to 5 mm SampleJet tubes
(Bruker BioSpin).

NMR Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
Samples were
measured using 600 MHz NMR spectrometers from Bruker BioSpin equipped
with an automated sample changer SampleJet (Bruker BioSpin) with sample
cooling and preheating station, a 5 mm inverse probe with z-gradient and automated tuning and matching and cooling
unit BCU-05 or BCU-I (Bruker BioSpin). The exact spectrometer and
probes used in the ring test are listed in Table S1 of the Supporting Information. TopSpin 3.5 PL2 (Bruker
BioSpin) was used for acquisition and processing. Automation of the
overall measurement procedure was controlled by ICON NMR (Bruker BioSpin).

For NMR experiments the standard operational procedures (SOP) described
in Dona et al. were applied.6 Before measurement,
each sample was kept for 5 min inside the NMR probe head in order
to achieve temperature equilibration at 310 K with deviation <0.1
K. Then, automated tuning and matching, automated locking, automated
shimming using TOPSHIM, automated optimization of the lock phase,
and automated determination of the 90° hard pulse was applied
to optimize the NMR experimental conditions. After this procedure,
a one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum was acquired using a
standard one-dimensional 1H NMR pulse sequence with suppression
of the water peak (Bruker pulse program library noesygppr1d), i.e.,
RD–P(90°)–4 μs–P(90°)–tm–P(90°) acquisition of the free
induction decay (FID). The relaxation delay (RD) and mixing time tm, were set to 4 s and 10 ms, respectively.
Low-power continuous wave irradiation (CW) for saturation of the water
resonance at rf field strengths of 25 Hz was applied during RD and tm for presaturation. Prior to the first and the last pulse, a z-gradient
was applied. After application of 4 dummy scans, 32 free induction
decays (FIDs) were collected into 98 304 (96k) data points
using a spectral width of 30 ppm (18 028.846 Hz). The receiver
gain was kept constant (RG = 90.5) for all samples. FIDs were multiplied
with an exponential function corresponding to a line broadening of
0.3 Hz prior to Fourier transformation and fully automated phasing
and baseline correction via the Bruker standard automation program
APK0.NOE. Quantitative calibration of the spectra was ensured using
the PULCON principle.23

Raw NMR spectra
were scaled to the ERETIC signal24 at 15
ppm, equivalent to 10 mM protons, and then aligned
to the alanine doublet in the region of 1.494–1.507 ppm using
icoshift25 with an offset modification
(icoshift ver. 3.0; Matlab source code is freely available for download
at www.models.life.ku.dk/algorithms), using command: [xCS,ints,ind,target] = icoshift(’average’,data,’1.507–1.494’,’b’,[2
1 0 20 1 1],ppm_scale).

Standard Clinical Parameters
Analyses
of plasma and
serum total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, and total triglycerides were
done using the automated, enzymatic, colorimetric assay on the ABX
Pentra 400 chemistry analyzer (ABX Pentra, Horiba ABX, Montpellier,
France). The CV% for these analyses was between 1.2% and 3.1%.

Sample
Selection
One of the 30 subjects included in
the ring test study was excluded from the analysis due to lack of
the ERETIC signal, and another subject was excluded because no plasma
standard clinical measurements were made. This resulted in plasma
and serum NMR spectra and clinical measurements for 28 individuals.
Thus, a total of 168 1D 1H NMR spectra were included in
this study (28 subjects × 2 sample types × 3 laboratories).

Partial Least Squares Model Transfer for LPD Estimation
The model used in this study to determine lipoprotein distributions
is the one presented in Mihaleva et al.9 This partial least squares (PLS) model, which was calibrated on
HPLC data,15 predicts cholesterol and triglyceride
concentrations in 3 main lipoprotein particle classes (HDL, VLDL,
LDL) and 13 subclasses (VLDL03, VLDL04, VLDL05, VLDL06, VLDL07, LDL08,
LDL09, LDL10, LDL11, HDL15, HDL16, HDL17, HDL18) from serum NMR spectra.

In order to successfully apply this PLS model, the scaled and aligned
ring test data were further processed (model transfer). To remove
chemical shift differences between the ring test NMR data and the
mean 1D 1H NMR spectrum of the model data,9 the ring test data was further aligned to the alanine doublet
of the model data using the mean spectrum as a target with icoshift25 as described earlier. From these realigned spectra,
only the 1.4–0.6 ppm region was considered for the data analysis,
as this region contains the methylene and methyl bands that allow
for the prediction of cholesterol and triglycerides concentrations
with the PLS model from Mihaleva et al.9 Given that for this region we had 3492 data points and the model
comprises 1746 data points, we used a binning size of 2. The data
was then rescaled to the mean of the data used to build the model
of Mihaleva et al.9 in order to get intensities
of similar magnitude; for this normalization, a scaling factor was
determined (Figure S2 of the Supporting Information). Because the PLS model used in this study was built on serum data,
we calculated the scaling factor c using the serum
ring test NMR spectra (eq 1) 1  where matrix A contains the training
set intensities of Mihaleva et al.,9 matrix B contains the ring test serum spectral data, n is the number of samples of the Mihaleva et al.9 training set (n = 190), m is the number of samples in the serum data set (m = 84), and p is the number of data points considered
(p = 1746).

Plasma and serum data were then
multiplied by this scaling factor
(Figure S2 of the Supporting Information). Cholesterol predictions were obtained on the region 1.04–0.6
ppm (971 chemical shifts) of the spectra, corresponding to the methyl
signal. Total triglyceride predictions were obtained using the region
1.4–0.6 ppm of the spectra (1746 chemical shifts), corresponding
to the methyl and methylene signals.9

Data Analysis
The results are structured according
to three different levels (Figure 1). Level 1 describes differences between laboratories
(BR/KU/UL) and between sample types (plasma/serum) in the NMR spectra.
Level 2 describes the differences between laboratories on their ability
to predict LPDs from the PLS model presented in Mihaleva et al.9 At level 3, the performance of the PLS model
is evaluated by comparing the lipid predictions with measured standard
lipid parameters.

Figure 1 Schematic of the different levels of the data analysis.

Level 1, Spectral Differences: Between-Sample
Type and between-Laboratory
Comparisons
Since the ultimate target of this paper is to
assess the reproducibility of NMR data acquisition for LPD determination
across laboratories, only the relevant part of the spectra that includes
the methylene and methyl signals is included in the calculations:
1.4–0.6 ppm. Principal component analysis (PCA) and ANOVA-simultaneous
component analysis (ASCA)26 were performed
with a view to understanding the variation in the data. Unlike PCA,
where the three different sources of variation (subject, sample type,
laboratory) cannot be distinguished, ASCA allows for the partitioning
of the variance in the data into different factors. This way, the
contribution of the different sources of variation can be properly
assessed. Additionally, a dissimilarity measure between data obtained
at the different laboratories and between data obtained from the different
sample types (plasma and serum) was calculated as indicated in eq 2: 2  where SS indicates sum of squares
and A and B are the spectral subsets to
be compared
(subsets from different laboratories for the between-laboratory comparison
and subsets from the two different sample types for the between-sample
type comparison). A dissimilarity value of r = 0
indicates maximum similarity and r = 1 maximum dissimilarity.
For derivation, see eq S1 of the Supporting Information.

Level 2, Lipoprotein Particle Distribution Prediction: Between-Laboratory
Comparisons
Lipoprotein particle distributions were predicted
from the NMR data using the PLS model presented in Mihaleva et al.9 Because this model was built on HPLC data, cholesterol
and triglyceride predictions of 3 main classes (HDL, VLDL, LDL) and
13 subclasses (VLDL03, VLDL04, VLDL05, VLDL06, VLDL07, LDL08, LDL09,
LDL10, LDL11, HDL15, HDL16, HDL17, HDL18) were obtained for the ring
test subjects.

In order to determine the contribution of the
three factors (subject, sample type, and laboratory) to the total
variation in the cholesterol and total triglyceride predictions, a
linear model was fitted on the predictions of all subclasses and ANOVA
was performed. For the determination of between-laboratory variation
per sample type (plasma/serum) absolute root-mean-square error (RMSE)
was calculated on the prediction of all (sub)classes (eq 3, where y1 and y2 are the predictions of two different
laboratories). 3  

Level 3, Model Performance
on the Prediction of Standard Lipid
Parameters
HDL class is the most suitable one to assess the
model performance on the ring test data, given that it is very well-defined,
allowing cholesterol measurements for this class to be compared across
different techniques (i.e., standard clinical measurements and HPLC
measurements). At this level, the model performance was assessed per
laboratory, for both plasma and serum samples, using the RMSE and
Pearson correlation coefficient of predicted and measured values of
HDL-C and additionally also of LDL-C (eq 3, where y1 and y2 are the predicted and clinical parameters,
respectively).

Results and Discussion
Characterization of the
Ring Test Population
The subjects
participating in the ring test were classified according to their
lipid levels as described by the National Cholesterol Education Program
(NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines (2002) based on serum
values (Figure 2, Table
S2 of the Supporting Information).27 Even though the lipid panels of plasma and serum
samples from the same subjects are very similar (with a correlation
of 0.9874, 0.9973, 0.9919, and 0.9960 for total cholesterol, HDL-C,
LDL-C, and total triglycerides, respectively), small lipid measurement
differences lead in some cases to different classification (Table
S2 of the Supporting Information). The
majority of the subjects sampled for the ring test had average or
close to average lipid values (Figure 2, Table S2 of the Supporting Information). Since most of the ring test samples fall within the ranges of
the cohort in which the model from Mihaleva et al.9 was built,28 we determined that
the model was applicable to the ring test cohort (Table 1).

LDL-C, and total triglyceride (TG) concentration

Structure of the Data Analysis
The
results are structured
according to the different levels specified in Figure 1. At level 1, differences between laboratory
(BR/KU/UL) and between sample type (plasma/serum) in the spectra are
analyzed. At level 2, an existing PLS model to predict lipoprotein
subclass from serum NMR spectra9 is used
to obtain lipid predictions from all spectra; differences between
laboratories in the predictions are studied. At level 3, the performance
of the PLS model on the ring test population is evaluated by comparing
the PLS predictions with the classical lipid panel measurements.

Level
1: Spectral Differences
In this study, the sources
of variation present in the NMR data (1.4–0.6 ppm, 1746 data
points) are (i) the subjects, (ii) the type of sample (plasma and
serum), and (iii) the laboratory (BR, KU, UL). PCA of all spectra
(Figure S3 of the Supporting Information) and PCA of the plasma and serum spectra separately (Figure S4 of
the Supporting Information) indicate that
between-subject variation dominates over between-sample type (plasma/serum)
variation, which in turn dominates over the between-laboratory variation. Figure 3 points out how small
the latter is and gives an idea of the level of reproducibility of
NMR measurements across laboratories.

Figure 3 Serum spectra of two representative subjects
obtained in three
different laboratories (BR, KU, UL). NMR data of the same subject
are very similar between laboratories, resulting in three same-colored
(blue, orange) overlapping lines. Also shown are the differences between
NMR spectra across laboratories for the two individuals (yellow, purple,
and green lines).

Given the multifactorial
nature of the data, PCA fails to provide
a good interpretation of the variation in the data. In order to improve
this, ASCA was applied, as this type of analysis allows for a good
separation of all sources of variation on the mean-centered spectral
data (Figure S5 of the Supporting Information).

The ASCA analysis determined that the between-subject variation
represents 97.99% of the overall explained variation in the data (Figure 4, parts a and b).
The between-sample type and between-laboratory variations of the spectra
were already visible in the PCA score plots (Figures S3 and S4 of
the Supporting Information), but a much
clearer sample grouping is revealed in the score plots of the factor
subject from the ASCA analysis (Figure 4a). The between-sample type variation represents 1.62%
of the overall explained spectral variation (Figure 4, parts c and d), while the between-laboratory
variation represents 0.39% of the total explained variation (Figure 4, parts e and f). Tables 2 and 3 also confirm that between-sample type variation is larger
than between-laboratory variation, as the dissimilarity values in
the between-sample type comparison are larger than those found in
the between-lab comparison.

test data (A = X) and the same data with
a 6% addition (B = 1.06A).

A PCA performed on the matrix corresponding
to the factor laboratory
results in a PC1 (explaining 81% of the variation) that revolves mostly
around the deviation of the UL spectra. Inspection of the corresponding
PC1 loadings shows that this deviation could be related to slightly
lower intensities of the UL measurements. PC2 of the between-laboratory
variation, which explains 19% of the between-laboratory variation,
clearly separates the spectra obtained at the KU from those obtained
at BR, with the UL spectra placed in between. Inspection of the corresponding
PC2 loadings show that this variation is related to a shift (or peak
shape) in the lactate doublet at 1.33 ppm and presumably a small shift
in the broad methylene and methyl signals. Overall, it is observed
that the BR and KU spectra are more similar to each other and that
the UL spectra exhibits deviation from these (Figure 4e, Tables 2 and 3). However, it should
be emphasized that this data analysis scrutinizes the variation between
laboratories, which only represents 0.39% of the overall systematic
variation and is already smaller than the 1% acceptable intralab spectroscopic
variation suggested by Dona et al.6 Several
factors might be playing a role in the small deviations of the UL
spectra, including (i) the slightly different NMR probe used at UL
(Inverse Cryo TCI) and (ii) tiny fluctuations in the air conditioning
experienced at the UL lab, which can lead to unstable room temperature
and thus to small peak broadening in some spectra.

The between-sample
type and between-laboratory variations are mostly
due to the lactate doublet in the 1.345–1.32 ppm region (Figure 4, parts d and f).
If the lactate doublet is removed, the percentage of the variation
explained by sample type drops to 0.53%, while the percentage of the
variation explained by the laboratory is not largely reduced (0.32%)
and subject explains 99.15% of the variation. These results seem to
indicate that sample type variation is largely related to minor pH
differences.

All in all, both the between-sample type variation
and the between-lab
variation in the ring test NMR spectra were determined to be low.
The fact that between-lab variation is so small indicates that the
NMR acquisition protocol here described is suitable for cross-cohort
studies by allowing direct interindividual comparison of NMR data
obtained in different laboratories.

Level 2: Lipoprotein Particle
Distribution Prediction
In the previous section (level 1)
it was shown that the spectra from
the three different laboratories are very similar. In this section,
the effect of the small spectral differences in the NMR data obtained
at the three different laboratories on the prediction of cholesterol
and triglyceride (TG) concentrations of lipoprotein subclasses will
be investigated. In order to do so, the model derived from Mihaleva
et al.,9 built on an apparently healthy,
hypercholesterolemic human population, is here applied to estimate
cholesterol and triglyceride content for a total of 16 lipoprotein
particle classes from the NMR data. Subsequently, these predictions
are analyzed in terms of between-laboratory differences.

The
lipid content of the samples of 28 subjects was predicted from the
serum and plasma NMR spectra of the three laboratories separately.
In Figure 5, the between-laboratory
differences in cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) serum predictions
in the VLDL06 subclass are depicted: BR versus KU, BR versus UL, and
UL versus KU. This subclass (VLDL06) is representative of the general
trend in all subclasses (Figure S6 of the Supporting Information). RMSE of the predictions obtained using data from
the three different laboratories was calculated to compare the predicted
cholesterol and TG concentrations (Figure 5). The RMSE of the comparisons UL–BR
and UL–KU of cholesterol predictions is slightly larger than
the RMSE of the comparison BR–KU. For the TG predictions, all
lab comparisons result in similar RMSE. The majority of data points
lie between the lines that indicate a ±5% deviation. Some data
points fall outside of the lines; however, it should be noted that
the majority of these points correspond to very low cholesterol and
triglyceride concentration predictions. Thus, the relative deviation
might be larger than 5%, but the absolute deviation (calculated as
RMSE) remains very small. Despite the fact that the model derived
from Mihaleva et al.9 is built on serum
data, it is observed that the cholesterol and TG predictions from
plasma NMR data of all three laboratories differ in a similar way
(Figure S7 of the Supporting Information).

PLS model. BR vs KU, BR vs UL, and UL vs KU (a and b) cholesterol
and (c and d) triglycerides serum predictions. (a and c) On the x axis, the value of the prediction of the first laboratory;

first laboratory; on the y axis, the difference between
the prediction of the second laboratory and the prediction of the
first one. The black line is drawn where predictions are equal; the
red dashed lines indicate a deviation of 5%.

A linear model was fit separately on the cholesterol and
triglycerides
predictions for all subclasses. Using this model, subject explains
99.16%, sample type 0.73%, and laboratory 0.11% of the total variation
of the cholesterol predictions explained by these three factors. In
the case of the triglyceride predictions, subject explains 99.44%
of the variation, sample type 0.48%, and laboratory 0.08% of the variation.
According to these values, both the sample type and the laboratory
variation in the predictions are reduced when compared to the original
NMR spectral differences given by the ASCA analysis (97.99% for subject,
1.62% for sample type, 0.39% for laboratory). The reduction in the
sample type and lab variation in LPD predictions is most likely due
to the fact that the regions of the spectra that contribute the most
to the NMR variation do not have a determinant weight (in terms of
regression coefficients) on the PLS predictions.

Summarizing,
the already low NMR between-lab variation translates
into even lower between-lab differences in lipid profile predictions.
Thus, implementation of this NMR protocol would enable LPD phenotyping
of large cohorts across different laboratories.

Level 3:
Model Performance on the Prediction of Standard Lipid
Parameters
In previous sections, it was shown that differences
in spectra from different laboratories and different sample types
(plasma/serum) are very small (level 1), translating into even smaller
differences in the prediction of lipoprotein distribution (level 2).
In this section (level 3), the performance of the PLS model on this
cohort is evaluated by comparing its predictions to the experimental
measurements (classical lipid panel). Figure 6 shows the comparison of the HDL-C serum
predictions to the serum HDL-C clinical measurements. The results
show that the predictions made on NMR data from different laboratories
for the same subject are very similar, even when the predicted values
differ from the measured values. The RMSE values, again very close
to each other between laboratories, are slightly larger than the one
reported for the Mihaleva test set HDL-C prediction (0.0679).9 The Pearson correlation coefficients are slightly
smaller than the Pearson correlation coefficient reported for the
HDL-C class in the Mihaleva test set (0.99).9 In spite of the fact that this PLS model was built with HPLC data
as response data and on a different cohort, these results show that
the model allows for a good prediction of HDL-C clinical measurements
on the population sampled in this study. The residuals of the fit
of PLS predictions and HDL-C clinical values were further investigated
(Figure S8 of the Supporting Information). This analysis corroborated the good fit of the model for average
values and the presence of larger errors for the subjects with more
deviating HDL-C values. The latter were not contained within the range
of the clinical HDL-C values of the training set in the Mihaleva model
(Table 1) and thus
had to be extrapolated by the model. Despite the fact that the model
derived from Mihaleva et al.9 is built
on serum data, it is observed that the model also performs well on
plasma data (Figure S9 of the Supporting Information). Results for the LDL-C class are shown in Figure S10 of the Supporting Information. For this class, the predictions
do not correlate with the clinical measurements as well as for the
HDL-C class, which might be a combination of an initial lower performance
of the model on the LDL class, differences in response data (clinical
vs HPLC) and differences in distributions across cohorts (Table 1). However, the predictions
of the three different laboratories are still very close.

of the PLS model on serum spectra from the three
laboratories. The black line is drawn where prediction and measurement
are equal; the red dashed lines indicate plus or minus 5%.

Conclusions
The present study evaluated
the reproducibility of a standardized
protocol and methodology for the acquisition of NMR data on blood
plasma and serum samples at different laboratories prior to the estimation
of clinically relevant lipid parameters of blood.

Analysis of
this ring test NMR data showed that the variation between
plasma and serum and the interlaboratory variation are small when
the measurement conditions are met. In fact, the interlaboratory variation
in the NMR spectral data was found to be smaller than the maximum
acceptable intralaboratory variation on the quality control samples.6 In order to determine the effect of the small
spectral differences upon lipoprotein predictions, an existing model9 for the prediction of lipoprotein parameters
was applied to the recorded spectra. The predictions from this model
proved to be very similar (even more than in the original NMR spectra)
between laboratories in both serum and plasma samples. The latter
fact confirmed that the reproducibility between different laboratories
is good enough for the lipoprotein profile predictions to be exchangeable.

The fact that both the population sampled in the Mihaleva et al.9 study and the population studied in the present
ring test were apparently healthy may be the reason why it was possible
to successfully apply this existing lipoprotein model to our data
after a model transfer. A future challenge will be to build a model
for LPD prediction that covers populations comprising a wide range
of phenotypes, i.e., lipoprotein particle distributions.

With
the successful implementation of this standardized protocol
for obtaining reproducible data between different laboratories, a
step is taken toward bringing NMR measurement of lipoprotein distributions
into biomarker development and diagnostics. By using an NMR-based
approach to predict LPDs, research and diagnostics can benefit from
the added value of lipid profile in multiple lipoprotein particle
subclasses while reducing the need for less efficient methods such
as ultracentrifugation or HPLC. Implementation of this protocol for
reproducible acquisition of NMR data will potentially allow LPD phenotyping
of large cohorts across different laboratories in future metastudies.
