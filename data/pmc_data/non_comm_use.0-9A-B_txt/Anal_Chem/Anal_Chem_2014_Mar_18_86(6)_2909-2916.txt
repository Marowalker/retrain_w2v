A benchtop miniature mass spectrometer
system, Mini 12, with ambient
ionization source and tandem mass spectrometry capabilities has been
developed and characterized. This instrument was developed as a self-contained
system to produce quantitative results for unprocessed samples of
small volumes including nonvolatile analytes. The ion processing system,
vacuum system, and control system are detailed. An integrated sample
loading system facilitates automated operation. A user interface has
been developed to acquire and to interpret analytical results for
personnel who have limited mass spectrometry knowledge. Peak widths
of Δm/z 0.6 Th (full width
at half-maximum) and a mass range of up to m/z 900 are demonstrated with the rectilinear ion trap mass
analyzer. Multistage experiments up to MS5 are accomplished.
Consumable cartridges have been designed for use in ambient paper
spray ionization, and the recently developed extraction spray ionization
method has been employed to improve the quantitative performance.
Monitoring of trace-levels of chemicals in therapeutic drugs, as well
as in food safety and environmental protection operations is demonstrated.
Dual MS/MS scans are implemented to obtain the intensities of the
fragment ions from the analyte and its internal standard, and the
ratio is used in quantitative analysis of complex samples. Limits
of quantitation (LOQ) of 7.5 ng/mL, with relative standard deviations
below 10%, have been obtained for selected therapeutic drugs in whole
blood throughout their individual therapeutic ranges.

==== Body
Mass spectrometry
(MS) is widely
recognized for its high sensitivity and high selectivity in chemical
analysis. In the application fields of drug discovery, clinical analysis,
food safety, and environmental monitoring, mass spectrometry plays
an important role in both qualitative and quantitative trace analysis.
Standard analytical procedures include multiple steps of sample pretreatment
and chromatographic separation prior to MS analysis, and these preliminary
steps can only be performed in analytical laboratories. The miniaturization
of mass spectrometry systems started more than a decade ago with the
clear aim of performing chemical analysis in its entirety in the field
and providing results rapidly.1

Early
in the miniaturization effort, significant research effort
went into the miniaturization of the mass analyzer.2−9 This had direct and indirect impact on the size of the entire MS
system. Later, miniature mass spectrometer systems were developed
using different mass analyzers. Among these systems, the ion trap
was preferred because of its modest vacuum requirements and intrinsic
MS/MS capabilities. A configuration with an ion trap as mass analyzer
and a pumping system composed of a Pfeiffer TPD 011 (later model HiPace
10, Pfeiffer Vacuum, Inc.) and a two-stage KNF diaphragm pump (model
1091-N84.0-8.99 or similar, KNF Neuberger, Inc.) became popular. This
configuration was used in the Purdue University Mini 10,10 the Griffin 600 (Griffin Analytical Technologies),11 the Guardion-7 (Torion Technologies),12 and the MMS-1000 (1st Detect Corp.).13 Ion traps can perform MS analysis in the millitorr
pressure range, significantly higher than for other mass analyzers,
and the miniature pumping system provides adequate pumping speed to
maintain vacuum for in-vacuum ionization, which is typically used
for analysis of gas samples. The development of the discontinuous
atmospheric pressure interface (DAPI) enabled the coupling of miniature
mass spectrometers to atmospheric pressure ionization sources,14 including electrospray ionization (ESI),15 atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI),16 and various ambient ionization sources.14,17−19

For volatile analytes, membrane introduction
systems20 are useful interfaces for in
situ analysis using
portable mass spectrometers. However, analysis of nonvolatile analytes
requires interfacing miniature mass spectrometers to external ionization
sources. The ambient ionization methods were developed to bypass several
steps in the analytical procedures for sample pretreatment and chromatographic
separation that are traditionally required for MS analysis of complex
samples.21,22 They allow analytes in complex matrices
to be directly sampled and ionized for MS analysis.23,24 Qualitative analysis at low limits of detection (LODs) has been
demonstrated with more than 30 ambient ionization methods, and the
recently developed method of paper spray ionization has provided good
limits of quantitation (LOQ) together with high accuracy in quantitative
analysis.25−28 Development of disposable sample cartridges was also demonstrated
to be feasible with paper spray.29 Our
recent efforts in developing miniature MS systems have resulted in
backpack and benchtop MS systems that share the same in-house control
electronics, but which are operated using different ambient ionization
sources and have different physical configurations. The backpack MS,
described in an accompanying manuscript,30 typically uses a low-temperature plasma probe for screening nonvolatile
compounds on surfaces. The benchtop miniature MS system described
here, the Mini 12, was designed as a proof-of-concept prototype for
targeted analysis. It is specifically aimed at point-of-care applications.

Minimizing the size and weight of the system has been a major goal
in the development of miniature MS systems, and a complete mass spectrometer
has been developed that weighed only 4 kg.31 The goal for the development of the Mini 12, however, was primarily
to have a system that can perform direct chemical analysis without
sample pretreatment and can be operated by untrained personnel. Use
of ambient ionization to avoid sample preparation and chemical purification
is a major convenience of such a system. Autonomous analysis, including
recording of MS and MS/MS spectra, data analysis, and direct reporting,
becomes possible with systems designed for specialized analysis. Specific
scan functions and calibration data can be preset and loaded during
operation and for data analysis, respectively.

The challenge
to achieving analytical performance qualified for
point-of-care or other types of regulated applications is to obtain
adequate sensitivity and precision in quantitation. Rectilinear ion
traps (RIT)8 have been used in the earlier
Mini 1010 and 11(31) and also now in the Mini 12 instrument developed
at Purdue. MS/MS analysis is performed to increase the chemical specificity
as well as to increase the signal-to-noise ratios for characteristic
ions in the direct analysis of complex mixtures.32 Quantitation at high precision of particular analytes in
condensed phase samples, such as blood or food samples, has not been
extensively investigated with miniature mass spectrometers, due to
the technical challenges and practical difficulties in achieving highly
reproducible results while maintaining the simplicity in the instrumentation
and operating procedure. The use of internal standards (IS) with paper
spray has been shown to improve the quantitation significantly, and
several nontraditional methods of adding the standards have been reported.33,34 Simple procedures for introducing IS for ambient ionization are
also required for POC or similar in situ applications of miniature
MS systems. Several solutions exist, including the use of IS-coated
capillaries for transferring samples.35 Transfer of quantitative performance to the miniaturized system
involves some other technical difficulties, which will be further
discussed later and favor ionization sources with stable signals.

System
Design and Instrumentation
An exemplary analytical procedure
intended for a miniature MS chemical
analysis system is shown in Figure 1a for the
particular case of drugs in blood. A small volume of blood is quantitatively
taken up using a capillary and transferred to a sample cartridge,
which is subsequently inserted into the MS system for automatic analysis.
Capillaries with internal standard coated on the inside wall are used
to transfer samples of about 1 μL during which the internal
standard mixes into the sample. Highly accurate quantitative data
(RSD < 3% at 10 ng/mL drug in blood) have previously been obtained
using commercial triple quadrupole mass spectrometer for direct analysis
using several ambient ionization methods.35 To minimize the need of human intervention, an autonomous procedure
for analysis and data processing was designed for the Mini 12 (Figure 1b). Once the sample cartridge is inserted into the
instrument, a bar code on the cartridge is read and used to search
the instructions for analysis of target chemicals, which include the
type of sample, target analytes, scan functions, and the calibration
curve stored in the database. Using therapeutic drug monitoring as
an example, two successive product ion scan functions for MS/MS analysis
of the drug and the internal standard are executed; that is, the intensity
of the target fragment ion generated from each precursor is recorded
(Figure 1c). The ratio of these ion abundances
is subsequently used to calculate the concentration based on a calibration
curve made and saved for the particular drug of interest in a blood
sample. A report of the analytical results can then be generated automatically
without requiring the user to analyze the mass spectra. For each scan,
the DAPI opens for 15 ms, and the ions introduced are trapped in the
RIT at elevated pressure (up to 500 mTorr). After a delay of 800 ms,
an MS or MS/MS scan is performed at 1 mTorr (Figure 1c).

Figure 1 (a) Mini 12 system that provides a simplified operational protocol.
(b) Flowchart for automated quantitative analysis using an internal
standard. (c) Operation of the dual MS/MS scan function in the time
domain.

The integrated Mini 12 system
weighs 25 kg, has dimensions of 19.6
× 22.1 × 16.5 in. (outer case measurements), consumes less
than 100 W of power, and operates with 110 V AC or from a battery.
The system configuration is shown in Figure 2a,b, and a schematic of the instrument control is shown in Figure 2d. The design of the ion source and the sample cartridges
adapted to different ambient ionization methods were evaluated. NanoESI
and APCI have also been used as ionization methods to characterize
the instrument. As a demonstration of the possible use for POC or
similar applications, the loading system shown in Figure 2a was developed to accept a single paper spray sample
cartridge (Figure 2c) for analysis. A paper
substrate with a sharp tip (∼30°) was sandwiched between
top and bottom plastic covers made from polyoxymethylene (Ultraform
N2320, BASF SE, Ludwigshafen, Germany) using 3D printing. Two openings
on the top cover of the cartridge allow deposition of the sample and
feed of the spray solvent. A stainless steel ball inserted into the
top cover of the cartridge allows application of the high voltage
to the paper substrate. Two solvent pumps (STH0CTCLF17, Fluid Metering,
Inc., NY) with a minimum dispensing volume of 2 μL were installed,
each connected to a 60 mL bottle filled with a spray solvent. This
system allows a choice of spray solvent.

12 system and (b) selected subsystems showing
ion generation, introduction, and analysis. (c) Design of paper spray
sample cartridge used with the Mini 12 system. (d) Schematic diagram
of the control electronics in the Mini 12 system.

A schematic of the system control is shown in Figure 2d, and more details on the MS control electronics
are provided
in the accompanying paper.30 A tablet computer
(HP Slate 2) with a touch screen was integrated into the system to
operate the user interface and to allow data processing. The tablet
communicated with the MS control board through a USB 2.0 connection.
Preoptimized scan functions and calibration functions for different
types of targeted analysis were stored on the tablet computer. The
scan function parameters were optimized using an expert user interface,
as shown in Figure S1. A simpler and more user-friendly interface
(Figure S2) was developed for end users. During operation, a user
could press a button on the screen to open the cartridge tray, which
was controlled through a solenoid actuator. Once the paper spray sample
cartridge was placed on the tray and inserted into the system, a magnetic
switch closed and triggered the analysis. A digital camera (NLV-2101,
Opticon, Inc., WA) installed underneath the plastic tray read the
bar code on the bottom of the paper cartridge. Identification of the
needed target analysis was made reading the bar code into the program
running on the tablet, and the corresponding scan functions were then
automatically downloaded to the scan control board. In the particular
case of analysis of a drug in blood with the use of an internal standard
and paper spray ionization, a solvent was selected and dispensed on
the basis of the target compound for optimal elution/ionization efficiency.
Two MS/MS scan functions, each of which isolated a different precursor
ion, were then executed in sequence. After the spectra data were recorded
and transferred back to the tablet, the ratio of the selected fragment
ions generated from the ionized drug and internal standard was calculated
and used for determination of the drug concentration based on the
corresponding calibration function, which was constructed using the
same drug and internal standard and the same type of matrix.

The vacuum manifold was fabricated with dimensions of 4.65 ×
5.00 × 4.74 in. (length × width × height) and with
inside dimensions of 3.95 × 4.30 × 4.04 in. It was pumped
using a 2 kg turbomolecular pump (HiPace 10, Pfeiffer Vacuum, Inc.,
Nashua, NH) and a 500 g two-stage diaphragm pump (MPU 1091-N84.0–8.99,
KNF Neuberger, Inc., Trenton, NJ). An ultimate vacuum pressure below
1 × 10–5 Torr was achieved with the DAPI closed.
The DAPI system used a normally closed pinch valve (390NC24330, ASCO
Valve, Inc., Florham Park, NJ) with conductive silicone tubing (i.d.
1/16 in., o.d. 1/8 in., and length 2 in., Simolex Rubber Corp., Plymouth,
MI) connecting two stainless steel tubes (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA).
The pinch valve controlled open/closed status of sampling. The stainless
steel tube leading into the trap had dimensions of 0.03 in. i.d.,
1/16 in. o.d., and a 10 cm length, and the other tube had dimensions
of 0.02 in. i.d., 1/16 in. o.d., and a 5 cm length. Both stainless
steel tubes were electrically grounded during operation. A 24 V dc
pulse signal was used to open the pinch valve. An rf coil of 1 in.
i.d. was used to provide a rf amplitude higher than 5.5 kVp–p at 1 MHz. Resonance ejection was performed using an AC signal with
the amplitudes of the AC and the main rf trapping signals ramping
simultaneously to record mass spectra. A scan speed up to 10 000
mass/charge units per second was used, unless otherwise specified.
The SWIFT (stored waveform inverse Fourier transform) waveform36 with a notch width of 7 kHz was used for isolation
of the precursor ion prior to an MS/MS scan. The detector assembly
(model 397, DeTech Detector Technology, Inc., MA) with an electron
multiplier and conversion dynode was used.19

Experimental Section
Whatman chromatography papers (Grade
1, ET31, and silica-coated
grade SG81) were used to prepare sample substrates for paper spray
(Figure S3a) and extraction spray analysis37 (Figure S3b). All chemicals were commercially available and used
without purification. The internal standard, amitriptyline-d6 was
purchased from CDN isotopes (Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada). All other
chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Bovine
whole blood stabilized with EDTAK2 was purchased from Innovative
Research (Novi, MI). Methanol and water were purchased from Mallinckrodt
(Hazelwood, MO) and used to prepare the spray solvent mixture (50/50,
v/v). Tissue of a tomato was homogenized using the protocol described
in a previous study38 to serve as a sample
for quantitative analysis. Stock solutions of analytes were directly
spiked into solvents or sample matrices to make standard samples for
quantitative measurements.

NanoESI, APCI, paper spray, and extraction
paper spray were used
as ionization methods in the characterization of the instrument performance.
For paper spray analysis, 2.5 μL of sample was deposited onto
the paper substrate using IS-coated capillary samplers35 and air-dried for up to 2 h. Methanol (40 μL)
was then applied to the paper to elute compounds from the matrix,
followed by the application of a high voltage of 4.3 kV to the paper
substrate for ionization.25 For extraction
spray, the analyte prepared in blood was preloaded onto a paper strip
(grade 1, length of 10 mm, width of 0.6 mm), which was inserted into
a nanoESI tube made in-house from a borosilicate glass tube. After
air drying (for up to 30 min), 5 μL of methanol was added into
the glass tube, and a high voltage of 1.8 kV was applied to the electrode
for compound elution and ionization. Further descriptions of the experimental
conditions used for paper spray ionization and extraction spray ionization
can be found in Supporting Information.

Performance Characterization
and Discussion
During the years the Mini 12 was in development,
many features
of the system were tested and improved. The discussion here focuses
on the performance of the MS analysis and the quality of the system
when used for quantitation of analytes in complex mixtures.

The resolution and mass range of the system were characterized
with nanoESI using methanol/water (50/50) solutions containing pure
compounds. As shown in the mass spectrum of 1 μg/mL clenbuterol
(Figure 3a), isotopic peaks m/z 277, 279, and 281 were clearly separated in the
mass selective instability scan performed at a scan rate of 3000 m/z per second and with a resonance ejection
signal at 350 kHz (q = 0.80, AC amplitude scanned
from 1.5 to 3.0 Vp–p). The FWHM
(full width at half-maximum) was Δm/z = 0.6, for a resolution m/Δm of 500. The nanoESI spectrum of a mixture containing three
therapeutic drugs (Figure 3b), tacrolimus (5
μg/mL, [M + H]+ at m/z 826), imatinib (1 μg/mL, [M + H]+ at m/z 494), and amitriptyline (1 μg/mL, [M +
H]+ at m/z 278), was
recorded at a scan rate of 10 000 m/z per second and with a resonance ejection at 300 kHz (q = 0.73, AC amplitude scan 3 .5–7.5 Vp–p). A maximum m/z above 850 was
obtained.

Figure 3 (a) Mass spectrum of 1 ppm clenbuterol recorded using nanoESI with
RIT operated at rf frequency 1000 kHz with resonance ejection at 350
kHz (q = 0.80) and ac amplitude ramped from 1.5 to
3.0 Vp–p. (b) Mass spectrum of 5 ppm tacrolimus,
1 ppm imatinib, and 1 ppm amitriptyline mixture recorded using nanoESI
and RIT rf frequency 1000 kHz and resonance ejection at 300 kHz and

nanoESI. (d) Mass spectrum of MS5 of 20 ppm clenbuterol
in 50/50 MeOH/H2O using nanoESI (inset shows the isolated
peak of ions with m/z 168).

As discussed earlier in this paper,
MS/MS capabilities are essential
for the deployment of a system like the Mini 12, which is aimed at
direct analysis of complex samples without traditional sample pretreatment
or chemical separation. Higher sensitivity can be obtained due to
the elimination of chemical noise and the identification of the target
analytes can be confirmed by appropriate fragmentations corresponding
to structural features of the analyte. The scan function for MS/MS
is shown in Figure S4. The MS/MS spectrum of 500 pg/mL thiabendazole
([M + H]+ at m/z 202,
Figure 3c) shows a good signal-to-noise ratio
for the fragment ion m/z 175. In
analysis of extremely complex mixtures, it is possible that multiple
stages (>2) of mass analysis might be necessary to confirm chemical
identity or to avoid interference in quantitation.39 As a demonstration of this capability, multiple stage MS
analysis (up to five stages) has been performed starting with 20 μg/mL
clenbuterol ([M + H]+ at m/z 277). The MS5 spectrum shown in Figure 3d displays very good S/N ratios for fragment ions m/z 132 and m/z 140. The spectra for the intermediate stages of this experiment
(viz., MS2, MS3, and MS4) are shown
in Figure S6. The MS/MS capability of the MS 12 has also been characterized
using APCI using a gas mixture sample containing vapors of dimethyl
methylphosphonate (DMMP), methyl salicylate, and N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) (Figure S7).

The ultimate goal in developing the Mini 12 MS system was to enable
the direct analysis of nonvolatile analytes in samples with complex
matrices. The sensitivity and the quantitative accuracy that can be
achieved with ambient ionization are critical for the intended applications.
Paper spray was selected as one of the main methods to be used with
the Mini 12, due to the sensitivity achieved for complex mixture analysis
and the potential for high-precision quantitation that has been demonstrated
with lab-scale triple quadrupole mass spectrometers.25,26 Another ambient ionization method used for performance development
and characterization with the Mini 12 was extraction spray. Instead
of spraying the solvent directly from the paper substrate, a paper
strip containing the sample was inserted into a nanoESI tube, and
a solvent was added to extract the analyte, which was sprayed from
the tip of the nanoESI emitter (Figure S3b). Good sensitivity can
be achieved with both methods.

The MS/MS spectra recorded for
analysis of amitriptyline at 50
ng/mL in blood using these two methods are shown in Figure 4a,b. Similar S/N ratios were observed for the peaks
for the fragment ions of m/z 117,
155, and 191 in both spectra. Sample amounts used for preparing the
dried blood spots (DBS) on paper substrates were different, with 2.5
μL being used for paper spray but only 1 μL for extraction
spray. The most significant difference in the experimental conditions
is the consumption of the spray solvent and the analysis time. About
1 min spray time was obtained in paper spray using 40 μL of
methanol, whereas more than 10 min spray time was available with only
5 μL of methanol in the extraction spray. A much lower spray
voltage of 1.8 kV was used for extraction spray, in comparison with
4.3 kV for paper spray. The stability of the signal was also much
better with extraction spray, as previously observed.37 Figure S5 shows a MS/MS spectrum for analysis of 10 ng/mL
verapamil in DBS prepared with 1 μL of blood sample, and the
S/N ratios observed for the fragment ions m/z 165 and m/z 303 indicate
that an LOD better than 10 ng/mL can be easily achieved. On the other
hand, at the current stage of development, extraction spray involves
more complex manipulations and is less amenable to automation and
array mode operation.

with
paper spray ionization and (b) extraction spray ionization. MS/MS

spray ionization.

One of the advantages
of using paper spray with the sample cartridge
designed for the Mini 12 is the flexibility in analysis of complex
samples in forms other than dried spots typically prepared from blood,
homogenates, or other liquid samples. As a demonstration, a small
piece (about 1 g) of the peel from an nonorganic orange was purchased
from a local grocery store and dropped onto the paper spray cartridge,
as shown in Figure 4c. Instead of feeding the
spray solvent from the other opening behind the stainless steel ball,
40 μL of methanol was directly added on top of the sample. The
spray voltage of 4.3 kV was then turned on, and MS/MS analysis was
performed targeting thiabendazole (precursor ion m/z 202), which is one of the most commonly used
fruit fungicides. A silica-coated paper substrate was used in this
case, as these have been demonstrated to be effective for paper spray
due to less retention of water-soluble organic compounds. The typical
fragment ions of protonated thiabendazole at m/z 131 and 175 were observed with high peak intensities (Figure 4c).

In many of the potential applications
of the Mini 12 system, mandatory
performance criteria will need to be met for regulatory purposes.
The LOQ, rather than the LOD, as well as the RSD over the entire calibration
range are important characteristics in the analytical performance
of the system. Ambient analysis using paper spray or extraction spray
with a commercial triple quadrupole instrument has been demonstrated
to give LOQs in the low ng/mL level and quantitative precision (RSD)
of better than 8% for drug compounds in whole blood. The use of internal
standards (IS) was also found to be critical,26 just as for LC-MS/MS. Although relatively good external calibration
could be obtained27 with tightly controlled
experimental conditions, for point-of-care type applications, the
use of the analyte-to-IS (A/IS) ratios could help significantly to
minimize the potential errors associated with variations in operation
by personnel not trained in laboratory analytical techniques. When
transferring multireaction monitoring (MRM) procedures for measuring
the A/IS ratios to a system like the Mini 12, some challenges were
foreseen. Therefore, the A/IS ratio was measured with dual MS/MS scans
in which two product ion scans were performed sequentially for the
analyte and IS. The analyte-to-IS (A/IS) ratio obtained was used to
calculate the analyte concentration based on the calibration curve.
A delay in the signal recording exists between these two scans, which
could cause a deviation in A/IS ratio especially when fluctuations
in the ion current are relatively large. The delay between the scans
is only about 100 ms for a commercial triple quadrupole instrument;
however, it is more than 1s for Mini 12 operation with a DAPI (Figure 1c), which represents a potential problem for quantitative
analysis using the Mini12.

To explore this issue, a set of tests
was run using blood samples
containing 200 ng/mL amitriptyline and 100 ng/mL amitriptyline-d6
as internal standards to characterize drug quantitation using Mini
12 with paper spray and extraction spray methods. MS/MS scans for
amitriptyline and amitriptyline-d6 were run alternately, and the intensity
of fragment ion m/z 233 recorded
was plotted as function of scan number, as shown in Figure 5. Greater fluctuations in the signal were observed
for paper spray than for extraction spray. The A/IS ratios calculated
for each pair of adjacent scans for amitriptyline and amitriptyline-d6
are plotted against the scan numbers (Figure 5c). The comparison of the stability in the A/IS ratios certainly
predicts a better opportunity for achieving high precision in quantitative
analysis with extraction spray. The variance in ratio was 200% for
paper spray but only 17% for extraction spray. An average of the signals
recorded over multiple scans could significantly improve the accuracy
in the calculation of the A/IS ratio.

and (b) extraction spray ionization. (c) Ratio of amitriptyline/amitriptyline-d6
in adjacent MS/MS scans using extraction spray ionization and paper

in blood with extraction spray ionization (product ion m/z of 233 was monitored).

A series of DBS samples containing the IS amitriptyline-d6
at 100
ng/mL but the analyte amitriptyline at different concentrations from
7.5 to 510 ng/mL were analyzed to develop a calibration curve for
quantitation. For each point in the curve, the samples were analyzed
and the A/IS ratio was calculated by averaging 50 pairs of scans for
each sample. The calibration curve was linear over the range from
15 ng/mL to 510 ng/mL (Figure 5d), which covers
the therapeutic range (80–250 ng/mL) for amitriptyline, but
most importantly, RSD values of better than 10% were achieved over
the entire range. As a means of monitoring the potential carryover
between samples or assessing contamination problems, MS/MS analysis
of blank paper substrates was performed using methanol/water (50/50,
v/v) solvent between the analyses of two blood samples containing
amitriptyline. No carryover problem was observed. An advantage of
using paper spray or extraction spray is that the majority of the
sample stays on the paper substrate and only a small portion of the
analytes are eluted and ionized for analysis.

Conclusion
A point-of-care
miniature mass spectrometry system, the Mini 12,
has been developed, built, and characterized. This system includes
an RIT miniature mass spectrometer and an ambient ionization source,
as well as a user-friendly interface that requires no special training
in MS. This system can perform direct mass spectrometry analysis on
such complex samples as whole blood, untreated food, and environmental
samples, without sample preparation or chromatographic separation.
In addition to fast turnaround times and in situ analysis capabilities,
disposable cartridges designed for ambient ionization source are used.
Further study will be continued to improve the sample handling protocol
and to develop a more advanced dual miniature ion trap system to optimize
time and sample usage as well as improving software for quantitative
POC MS analysis.
