In-situ
monitoring of radiocarbon emissions is challenging due
to the lack of a suitable method for sensitive online detection of
this isotope. Here we report on a complete system for automatized
continuous on-site monitoring of radiocarbon gaseous emissions from
nuclear facilities. By combining radiocarbon detection using mid-infrared
cavity ring-down spectroscopy and an advanced sampling system, an
elevated amount of radiocarbon in an atmospheric-like gas matrix was
detected. Radiocarbon was detected in the form of 14CO2 after extraction of the carbon dioxide from the air sample.
The system is also able to discriminate between radiocarbon in organic
or inorganic molecular form by converting 14CH4 into 14CO2. This work lays the groundwork
for further use of this technology in nuclear facilities for online
on-site monitoring of radioactive gaseous emissions as well as future
work on in-situ monitoring of atmospheric radiocarbon.

==== Body
Long-lived radionuclides, such
as radiocarbon (C-14), are problematic because they have a high residence
time in the environment and can easily be assimilated into living
matter.1 They are the main source of radioactive
gas emissions in nuclear facilities, are highly mobile in the environment,
and, due to their long half-life (5700 years for C-142,3), require long-term monitoring. These radionuclides are particularly
challenging to detect on-site, as current methods are based on laboratory-based
detection techniques. Rapid continuous in-situ analysis would be valuable
as it can provide better monitoring capabilities in support of power
plant operators, nuclear waste management organizations, and regulators.

Radiocarbon is present in all parts of nuclear power plants, where
it is one of the main sources of radioactive gaseous emissions, mostly
in the form of carbon dioxide or methane, for instance, produced through
the biodegration of radioactive waste.4 Operational gaseous emissions take place inside nuclear facilities,
and radiocarbon is emitted through the stack air with a C-14 activity
concentration in the range 200–400 Bq/m3.5 Gaseous radiocarbon monitoring currently requires
a long collection time and lengthy radiochemistry analysis before
determining its concentration, for instance, using liquid scintillation
counting (LSC). In recent years, optical detection of radiocarbon
in the form of 14CO2 has been successfully demonstrated,
and low detection limits were achieved.6−11 These measurements were performed with samples containing pure CO2, which is rarely the case in nuclear facilities. In this
article, we report on work toward in-situ continuous monitoring of
C-14 emissions in the form of carbon dioxide and methane. Those molecules
are detected using an optical method after extraction of the carbon
dioxide from an air-like matrix.

Optical detection of C-14 offers
several advantages over conventionally
used techniques for nuclear applications, such as LSC, which is commonly
used for laboratory analysis in nuclear facilities. LSC requires sample
collection and off-line analysis and in most cases is not suitable
for on-site monitoring. Gaseous samples must be trapped in liquid
form and bound to the medium, which will produce additional radioactive
waste. Additionally, scintillation peaks of different radionuclides
typically overlap in LSC spectra, thus limiting its sensitivity and
often requiring time-consuming radiochemistry methods to separate
the different beta emitters.

Laser spectroscopy can circumvent
most of these issues. It analyzes
directly gaseous samples, thus producing no additional waste. The
use of an optical technique also enables compact, automated, and cost-effective
instruments to be built, ideal for online in-situ monitoring. The
method is selective and will only be sensitive to one radionuclide,
meaning that the radiocarbon content can easily be determined even
if the sample contains other radionuclides. The method also detects
only one molecular form and thus provides a means to determine its
speciation. In the case of radiocarbon, 14CO2 is detected while other organic species such as 14CH4 are not. Organic C-14 is more easily assimilated by living
organisms and its monitoring is pertinent. While most work on optical detection of C-14 has so
far focused on 14CO2 detection, direct optical
detection of other molecules, such as 14CH4,
can also be envisioned.12 Other radionuclides
such as tritium, in the form of tritiated water, can also be detected
using laser spectroscopy13 and can, in
the future, be combined with radiocarbon detection.

Radiocarbon
detection also has numerous applications in other fields
of science. It is present in a trace amount in the atmosphere with
a natural abundance of 14C/C = 1.2 ppt, and all carbon
of biogenic origin has the same isotopic abundance. On the other hand,
carbon of fossil origin does not contain any radiocarbon, being millions
of years old and having completely decayed. C-14 is thus the ideal
tracer to discriminate between emissions of fossil or biogenic origin
and can be used for biofraction determination,14,15 carbon dating, or apportion of emissions sources. It is commonly
used in biomedicine to label compounds for drug development. In those
cases, accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) is used as it can deliver
extremely high sensitivity, but it usually requires complex sample
preparation and is not suitable for in-situ measurements. Optical
methods can therefore also provide an alternative to AMS for C-14
detection.11,16 The results presented here contribute
to demonstrate the viability of the method for on-site measurements
of low levels of C-14 in the atmosphere as issues associated with
the analysis of radiocarbon in atmospheric samples are addressed.

Methods
Overview
In typical samples from nuclear facilities
the CO2 concentration ranges from 400 ppm to a few percent,
while the 14C/C ratio is in the range 1–100 ppb.
This corresponds to activity values in the range from 40 Bq/m3 to 100 kBq/m3. The amount of methane significantly
varies but can reach values similar to 14CO2. In most cases, detection of 14CO2 with the
optical method is thus not feasible without first concentrating the
CO2. The C-14 monitoring system consists therefore of two
parts: a sampling module to extract CO2 from air and convert
methane into carbon dioxide and a laser spectroscopy module to detect
trace amounts of 14CO2, which is based on the
cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) technique, as illustrated in Figure 1a. In CRDS, the ring-down
time, τ, is recorded at each wavelength and by comparing it
with the vacuum ring-down time, τ0, the sample absorption
spectrum is computed. If the line strength is known, the gas concentration
can be inferred. A quantum cascade laser (QCL) is used as a light
source and coupled to a 40 cm long cavity composed of high-reflectivity
mirrors (>99.97%). The cavity used in this work has a vacuum ring-down
time of 5.2 μs. Light is detected by a photovoltaic detector
at the output of the cavity. By using these components one can achieve
high sensitivity in a compact setup with a footprint of 45 cm ×
60 cm. The strongest absorption band for the detection of 14CO2 corresponds to the fundamental asymmetric stretching
vibration band ν3. The P20e transition situated at
2209.11 cm–1 (or 4.52 μm) is used in this
work, as it has been shown to be the most suitable line, with minimum
interferences from other isotopes.17−20 The CRDS system was described
in more detail in our previous publication, where it was characterized
using pure CO2.7

Figure 1 Schematic of the experimental
arrangement. The instrumentation
consist of two parts. (a) CRDS system to detect 14CO2. A current ramp is applied to the QCL to scan its wavelength,
ν, and the corresponding ring-down time as a function of wavelength,
τ(ν), is determined, allowing one to deduce the concentration
of each gas species. (b) Sampling system to extract CO2 from air and convert organic C-14 into CO2.

Sampling Unit
The sampling unit is composed of two
main parts: a cryogenic trap to extract the CO2 out of
air and a catalytic conversion reactor to convert organic carbon into
carbon dioxide in order to differentiate between these two types of
radioactive emissions. CO2 extraction from air samples
is achieved by freezing the CO2 in a trap cooled down to
below the freezing point of CO2 (195 K). By subsequently
heating the trap to a temperature above this, almost pure CO2 is produced which can then be analyzed using laser spectroscopy.
The trapping system is based on designs by Miller et al.21 and Mohn et al.22 The trap consists of 1/16″ stainless steel tubing coiled
around a copper piece, which is cooled down by a cryogenic cooler,
as shown in Figure 1b. The cryogenic cooler is a Brooks PCC Compact Cooler, which does
not require any liquid nitrogen, and is thus ideal for future on-site
measurements. To prevent clogging the trap with water ice, it is essential
to remove water vapor before flowing the sample through the trap.
This is achieved using a Nafion dryer and magnesium perchlorate. An
extraction sequence typically consist of 15–30 min at low temperature
(around 150 K), where the sample flows at 0.1–0.2 L/min through
the trap. The trap inlet is then closed, and the remaining air in
the trap is removed by pumping it to vacuum for a few minutes. The
trap is then resistively heated until it reaches 230 K to release
the frozen CO2 into the CRDS cell, which has been pumped
to vacuum beforehand. The pressure reached in the CRDS cell is measured
with a capacitance manometer. Note that after a few cycles water accumulates
in the trap, and it is then necessary to heat it to room temperature
in order to remove the water ice clogging the tubing. The trap is
able to extract a maximum of 10–15 mg of CO2 in
each cycle. In this way, almost pure CO2 (>90%) is directed
into the measurement cell, allowing for 14CO2 detection using laser spectroscopy. During the CRDS measurement,
trapping of a new sample is initiated with the trap cooling down again
and the collection of the next sample starting. The whole sampling
cycle is automatized using solenoid valves controlled by LabView.

Organic carbon, such as 14CH4, is detected
by converting CH4 into CO2 using catalytic conversion.23 By performing two measurements, with and without
catalytic conversion, it is possible to determine the amount of C-14
in the form of CO2 or CH4. For this purpose
a palladium catalyst was used, which achieves efficient oxidation
above 300 °C. In our system, the reactor was operated above 500
°C and a conversion efficiency close to 100% was achieved. The
Pd catalyst was prepared on alumina carrier with 2.2 wt % of Pd according
to the method described by Fouladvand et al.24 The sample flows through 0.5 mL of catalyst before being directed
through the water removal section and finally into the cryogenic trap
where CO2 freezes.

N2O Removal
In most atmospheric-like samples,
N2O is also present in a trace amount (330 ppb). Unfortunately
N2O has a freezing point (182 K) very close to the freezing
point of CO2. With the current design, the cold source
is attached to the bottom of the trap, resulting in a temperature
gradient along the axis of the trap. It is thus difficult to control
the trap temperature and achieve a homogeneous trap temperature, resulting
in N2O also being trapped. N2O has strong absorption
lines in the wavelength region at which 14CO2 is detected, which will then interfere with the measurement. It
is thus necessary to remove N2O in order to achieve the
highest sensitivity. In this work, this is achieved by oxidizing N2O into N2Ox with x ≥ 2 using catalytic conversion. This reaction also
occurs with the Pd catalyst, but it is necessary to have an another
catalyst, which can selectively convert N2O without converting
methane into CO2, in order to maintain the capability of
differentiating the molecular forms of radiocarbon. It was found that
a NiO catalyst was selectively converting N2O and could
be used for this application. The particular form of the NiO catalyst
was a NiO/NaOH catalyst prepared according to the method described
by Yu et al.,25 and 0.5 mL of this catalyst
was used.

Many parameters affects the amounts of trapped CO2 and residual N2O. Increased trapping time or flow
rate will increase the amount of trapped CO2. N2O removal is linearly dependent with the volume of catalyst and inversely
dependent on the flow rate. A smaller flow rate will thus result in
a more efficient N2O removal. The chosen flow rate is therefore
a compromise between amount of CO2 trapped and N2O removal. The catalyst temperature also influences N2O removal, and higher temperatures will more efficiently remove N2O.

This is illustrated in Figure 2a, where the absorption spectra recorded
with the CRDS
system with different trapping parameters are presented. The samples
were collected using laboratory air flowing through the cryogenic
trap for 30 min and analyzed with the CRDS system. The spectra were
recorded in the wavelength range 2208.95–2209.05 cm–1, where absorption lines of both CO2 and N2O are present. The different absorption lines were identified using
the HITRAN database.26 The different sampling
parameters and resulting CO2 and N2O concentration
are summarized in Table 1. While the CO2 concentration remains constant around
90%, the amount of trapped CO2 increases as the flow rates
increase, and higher pressure in the measurement cell is reached.
The remaining 5–10% mostly consists of air (with an elevated
amount of N2O and water) which remains in the trap after
flowing the air sample and, in some cases, is not properly flushed
out. A larger flow rate will result in more N2O being trapped
because the catalytic conversion of N2O is less efficient
at larger flow rates. Finally, the conversion efficiency also depends
on the temperature of the catalyst, and a lower concentration of N2O is present at higher catalyst temperatures.

The optical measurement itself
is fast (typically a few minutes),
but the overall analysis time is limited by the trapping time which
is relatively long. With the current configuration, a full measurement
sequence (14CO2 and 14CH4 analysis) takes 1.5 h. While this is a long time, it is still an
order of magnitude shorter than currently used techniques, where sample
collection and analysis can take several days. In this first prototype,
the sampling cycle duration is limited for mainly two reasons. First,
the volume and weight of the trap is relatively large, requiring long
times for cooling down and heating. The cavity volume is 180 mL, which
is larger than necessary, and longer trapping times are needed in
order to freeze sufficient CO2. Second, to achieve optimum
N2O removal, low flow rates are used, which increases the
trapping time. A shorter sampling time can be achieved by reducing
the sampling cell volume and the weight of the trap and by increasing
the amount of catalyst, which will allow one to increase the flow
rate while keeping similar N2O removal capabilities.

Figure 2b shows
a measurement carried out using laboratory air with optimum trapping
parameters around the 2209.1 cm–1 region where the
P20e line of 14CO2 is situated. The sample was
circulating at 0.2 L/min through the cryogenic trap for 15 min, and
a CO2 pressure of 5.1 mbar was reached in the CRDS cell.
As expected, no 14CO2 is observed, as the atmostpheric
C-14 concentration of 1.2 ppt is below the sensitivity limit of our
instrumentation. With increased sensitivity and improved N2O removal, atmospheric radiocarbon content monitoring can be achieved
in the future with a similar system, which is of great importance
for climate sciences.27,28

The positions of the residual
N2O absorption lines are
used to give an absolute calibration for the wavenumber scale of the
QCL. In particular, the lines situated at 2209.063, 2209.085, and
2209.147 cm–1, observed in Figure 2b, are used to calibrate the wavelength scale
of spectra recorded around the targeted 14CO2 line.

Results
To further test the system,
a standardized sample was prepared
by the National Physical Laboratory with an elevated amount of 14CO2 and 14CH4 in an air
matrix, similar to what could be expected from outgasing of nuclear
waste or nuclear power plant stack emissions. The samples were prepared
from concentrated 14CO2 and 14CH4, which were subsequently pressurized with stable CO2 and CH4, respectively. The standardized activity concentrations
of these master cylinders were 15.56 ± 0.32 and 175.7 ±
3.0 MBq/m3, determined by absolute internal-gas proportional
counting. The samples were mixed, further diluted gravimetrically,
and pressurized with a known mass of compressed dry air. The final
C-14 concentration of the sample was thus 339 ± 30 Bq/m3 for 14CO2 and 208 ± 18 Bq/m3 for 14CH4. The gas composition and purity
of the samples were not directly measured.

To fully determine
the absolute amount of 14CO2 and 14CH4 of the sample, 6 different measurements
are necessary. First, measurements without CO2 extraction
through the cryogenic trap are carried out to determine the total
amount of carbon dioxide and methane in the sample. These measurements
are carried out with and without catalytic conversion. Two absorption
lines of 13C16O2 situated at 2209.93
and 2209.95 cm–1 are used, and the concentration
of CO2 in the sample or CO2+CH4, c3, is obtained. These measurements are fast
(<1 min) as CO2 trapping is not required.

Another
set of measurements is then carried out with the sample
flowing through the cryogenic trap where CO2 is extracted.
Those measurements are also performed with and without catalytic conversion.
The laser is tuned to the wavelength region where the 14CO2 line is situated at 2209.1 cm–1 to
determine the concentration of C-14, c1. Finally, by tuning the laser to absorption lines of stable CO2 isotopes (12C16O2), the
concentration of CO2 in the trap, c2, is obtained using the CO2 line situated at 2209.0116
cm–1 in Figure 2a. Using the line areas obtained from the fits and
the known absorption line strength of the transitions, the gas concentrations
are determined by ci = AikBT/(S0i(T)p), where Ai is the line area of the targeted absorption
line, S0i its line strength, kB the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature of the sample, and p the sample
pressure. The transition intensitiy of the P20e line of 14CO2, S01 = 2.8 × 10–18 cm–1/(molecules cm–2), was previously determined by Zak et al. using ab initio quantum
chemistry methods.20 The same method was
used by Zak et al. to calculate the values for S02(29) and S03(20) which are used here. The absolute
amount of C-14 in the sample is then c = c1c3/c2.

The system was used to analyze the standardized
samples, and the
obtained spectra are shown in Figure 3. In Figure 3a, the sample was flowing through the NiO catalyst, while
in Figure 3c it was
flowing trough the Pd catalyst, thus converting organic carbon into
CO2. In both cases, the trapping time was 30 min, the flow
rate 0.2 L/min, and the catalyst temperature 600 °C. The spectra
were recorded for 5 min with a data acquisition rate of about 35 Hz,
resulting in about 10 000 points for each spectrum. In Figure 3a, the pressure reached
in the measurement cell was 12.2 mbar, while in Figure 3c it was 17.6 mbar. The pressure was higher
due to additional CO2 produced through the conversion of
methane into carbon dioxide. The measurement cell and sample were
at room temperature, i.e., 21 °C. Compared to the spectrum shown
in Figure 2b, an additional
peak is observed, which is the 14CO2 absorption
line.

Figure 3 Absorption spectra recorded after CO2 purification using
the sampling system. (a) Only C-14 in the form of CO2 was
detected. (c) Organic radiocarbon was also detected (CO2+CH4). In red, fits of the experimental data are shown
with their residuals in b and d. Each point corresponds to a ring-down
event. Ring-down events exhibiting a too large fit residual were discarded
(about 1% of events), as it corresponds to the coupling of higher
order modes.

The set of 6 measurements was
carried out using the procedure described
earlier, and the concentrations c1, c2, and c3 were determined
for both CO2 and CO2+CH4. The concentrations
were calculated by fitting the absorption spectra by a sum of Voigt
profiles using a nonlinear least-squares-fitting routine. The obtained
fits for the determination of c1 are shown
in red in Figure 3a
and 3c, with the corresponding fit residuals
in Figure 3b and 3d. In order to correctly model the background other
strong absorption lines of CO2 outside of this wavelength
range (situated at 2208.946, 2208.99, 2209.91, and 2209.374 cm–1) were also included in the fitting model.

The
obtained concentration values are presented in Table 2. The C-14 activity concentration
is calculated in the following way: c̃ = cp0/(kbTt1/2 ln(2)), with p0 being the atmospheric pressure and t1/2 = 5700 ± 30 years the C-14 half-life.2,3 These
values lead to activity concentrations of 327 Bq/m3 for 14CO2 and 187 Bq/m3 for 14CH4 in agreement with the values from the standard, c̃s. Similar activity
concentration are expected in nuclear facilities, and the achieved
sensitivity is thus sufficient for such applications.

a c̃s are the activity concentration values determined conventionally
during the preparation of the sample.

The uncertainty of the concentration calculations,
listed in Table 2,
is derived from
the fit residuals, which is the main uncertainty in the measurements.
The limit of sensitivity of this system is estimated to be 30 Bq/m3. In our previous work,7 a sensitivity
of 2 Bq/m3 is forecast after CO2 purification.
However, this was established without taking into account interferences
from neighboring N2O lines which are currently limiting
the sensitivity. Additionally, each measurement step to determine c1, c2, and c3 introduces uncertainties that were not taken
into account in our previous work.

Conclusions
We
have demonstrated a full instrumentation for monitoring of elevated
C-14 emissions in both organic and inorganic form in atmospheric-like
samples. The achieved sensitivity is sufficient for monitoring of
fugitive gaseous emissions from nuclear facilities. This work also
paves the way for future work on in-situ monitoring of radiocarbon
at its natural abundance, which is of great importance for source
apportion of CO2 emissions.

Future efforts will focus
on reducing the uncertainty of the measurement,
first by improving the removal of N2O. By using a sensor
specifically designed for CO2 measurement, the absolute
amount of carbon dioxide in the sample, c3, can also be more precisely measured, thus reducing the overall
uncertainty of the measurement. Note that for some applications, such
as source apportion, only the isotopic ratio needs to be determined,
i.e., c1/c2, and lower uncertainty could be achieved as c3 does not need to be measured. Finally, further work will
be carried out to reduce the sampling time with a better trap design.
Reduction of the size of the instrumentation, in particular, of the
sampling system, will lead to future in-situ measurements at a nuclear
facility. Increased sensitivity can be achieved by additionally cooling
down the samples to reduce the remaining interference of lines from
stable isotope CO2.18 With these
improvements one can envision a similar system to measure C-14 from
atmospheric samples below its natural abundance, opening the way to
more applications.
