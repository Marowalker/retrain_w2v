In this study, a series of new BF2-chelated
tetraarylazadipyrromethane
dyes are synthesized and are shown to be suitable for the preparation
of on/off photoinduced electron transfer modulated fluorescent sensors.
The new indicators are noncovalently entrapped in polyurethane hydrogel
D4 and feature absorption maxima in the range 660–710 nm and
fluorescence emission maxima at 680–740 nm. Indicators have
high molar absorption coefficients of ∼80 000 M–1 cm–1, good quantum yields (up to
20%), excellent photostability and low cross-sensitivity to the ionic
strength. pKa values of indicators are
determined from absorbance and fluorescence measurements and range
from 7 to 11, depending on the substitution pattern of electron-donating
and -withdrawing functionalities. Therefore, the new indicators are
suitable for exploitation and adaptation in a diverse range of analytical
applications. Apparent pKa values in sensor
films derived from fluorescence data show 0.5–1 pH units lower
values in comparison with those derived from the absorption data due
to Förster resonance energy transfer from protonated to deprotonated
form. A dual-lifetime referenced sensor is prepared, and application
for monitoring of pH in corals is demonstrated.

==== Body
Design, synthesis, and spectroscopic/photophysical
characterization of novel fluorescent chemosensors remains a central
research field in analytical chemistry.1 The measurement of pH by fluorescence-based techniques is well established
for both imaging and sensing applications2,3 in various
fields of experimental science, such as biomedical research,4−10 marine biology,11,12 and biotechnology.13,14 The most frequently used fluorescent pH indicators are 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic
acid (HPTS), carboxyfluorescein derivatives, seminaphthorhodafluors
(SNARFs), and hydroxycoumarins.15−19 However, these indicators suffer from several drawbacks. For example,
carboxyfluorescein has only moderate photostability, and the photostability
of 2′,7′-dihexylfluorescein (suitable for measurements
in seawater) is very poor;20 the pKa value of HPTS is highly dependent on ionic
strength of solution; and most coumarins are excitable only by high-energy
radiation in the range from 350 to 450 nm.

In biological applications,
it is desirable to use fluorophores
with absorption/emission profiles in the red or near-infrared (NIR)
spectral regions because they have many advantages: significant reduction
of the background signal due to the low absorption and autofluorescence
of biomolecules in the NIR region, low light scattering and deep penetration
of the NIR light, and the possibility to use low-cost excitation light
sources. Despite the optical benefits, there is a surprising scarcity
of pH indicators that have such desired absorption and emission properties.
Although the water-soluble SNARF indicators and their lipophilic derivatives
do absorb at ∼630 nm, they possess only moderate brightness
and photostability.21 The same holds for
the cyanine dyes, which are well-known NIR chromophores that have
only scarcely been proposed as pH indicators.22,23

In contrast, BF2-chelated tetraarylazadipyrromethane
dyes (aza-BODIPYs) represent an interesting class of NIR chromophores
that are amenable to structural modification and exhibit excellent
photophysical properties.24 Several fluorescent
pH indicators based on aza-BODIPY dyes bearing amino- or hydroxy-functionalized
substituents were reported by O’Shea and co-workers.25−27 These on/off pH indicators show photoinduced electron transfer from
an amino group or a twisted phenolate to the aza-BODIPY subunit, causing
fluorescence quenching in the deprotonated state. However, these probes
cover only acidic and near-neutral range. A systematic study of the
properties of these pH indicators and possible synthetic modifications
wtih respect to tuning the pKa values
has not previously been reported in the literature.

In the present
study, we investigated the synthesis and characterization
of aza-BODIPY fluorophores that can probe pH changes by large associated
changes in their emission intensity around 700 nm and possess pKa values in the physiological and alkaline pH
range. Eight 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-triaza-s-indacene dyes that can detect pH through
a photoinduced electron transfer process were synthesized and characterized.
We show that the pKa values of the new
indicators can be tuned over a wide range, and simple prediction rules
can be derived. This enables a variety of potential applications for
sensors and imaging. As an example, an application of the new sensing
materials for fiber-optic pH measurements in marine biology is demonstrated.

Preparation of Sensor Foils and Fiber-Optic Microsensors
A “cocktail” containing an indicator dye (0.25 mg),
hydrogel D4 (100 mg) in 700 μL EtOH/H2O (9:1 v/v),
and tetrahydrofurane (300 μL) was knife-coated on a dust-free
Mylar support to obtain a ∼2.5 μm thick sensing layer
after solvent evaporation.

The “cocktail” for
the dual-lifetime referenced sensor was prepared similarly from 0.1
mg of indicator dye 1 with addition of 200 mg of Cr-GAB
particles. Subsequently, it was coated on the tip of an optical fiber
(Ø 400 μm) from Specialty Photonics (www.specialtyphotonics.com). The sensors were allowed to dry 30 min in the ambient to ensure
complete evaporation of the solvent. Between measurements, the sensors
were stored in darkness at room temperature.

Methods
Absorption measurements were performed on a
Cary 50 UV–vis spectrophotometer from Varian (www.varianinc.com). The molar absorption coefficients were determined as an average
of three independent measurements for the concentrations of the dyes
2.5–3.4 × 10–6 M. Fluorescence spectra
were recorded on a Hitachi F-7000 spectrofluorometer (www.hitachi.com). Relative fluorescence quantum yields were determined according
to Demas and Crosby29 using tera-tert-butyl-29H,31H-phtalocyanine
(Fluka, www.sigmaaldrich.com) as a standard (quantum yield
= 0.44).30 Two independent measurements
were performed to obtain the average value. The concentration of the
indicators was kept below 1.5 × 10–6 M to avoid
dye aggregation and reabsorption of the fluorescence. NMR spectra
were recorded on a 300 MHz instrument (Bruker) in DMSO-d6 or CDCl3 with TMS as a standard. Electron
impact (EI, 70 eV) mass spectra were recorded on a Waters GCT Premier
equipped with direct insertion (DI). The pH of the buffer solutions
(CHES, MES, and CAPS) was controlled by a digital pH meter (InoLab
pH/ion, WTW GmbH & Co. KG, www.wtw.com) calibrated
at 25 °C with standard buffers of pH 7.0 and pH 4.0 (WTW GmbH
& Co. KG, www.wtw.com). The buffers were adjusted to
constant ionic strength (IS = 0.02 or 0.15 M) using sodium chloride
as the background electrolyte. Dual-lifetime referenced measurements
were performed with a fiber-optic Firesting fluorometer from Pyroscience
(www.pyro-science.com) with a modulation frequency of 4
kHz.

Photobleaching experiments in solutions were performed
by irradiating the samples with light from a 642-nm high-power 10
W LED array (www.led-tech.de) focused through a lens purchased
from Edmund optics (www.edmundoptics.de). The photodegradation
profiles were obtained by monitoring the absorption spectra. For the
leaching test, sensor foil (D4) was placed in a flow-through cell,
and the absorption of the films was monitored while aqueous buffer
(IS = 0.02 M) was passed through it. A detailed description of the
pH measurements in the gastric cavity of a symbiont bearing coral
(Goniopora sp.) is contained in the Supporting Information.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
Two general methods to prepare azadipyrromethene
chromophore are known. In the first method, 2,4-diarylpyrroles act
as precursors, and are converted into their 5-nitroso derivatives,
which are then condensed with a second molecule of pyrrole to yield
unsymmetric derivatives.31 In the second
method, nitromethane adducts of chalcones are reacted with ammonium
salts at elevated temperatures to give symmetric azadipyrromethenes.32 Conversion of the diarylnitroketones into pyrroles
and 5-nitrosopyrroles and the isolation of these products is not required
in this method.

Unsymmetrical derivatives of the aza-BODIPYs
bearing only one pH-sensitive group were strongly preferable to the
symmetrical ones for several reasons: (i) a simple acid–base
equilibrium including only two forms of the indicator; (ii) significantly
higher hydrophobic character of the monosubstituted derivatives compared
to the symmetrical ones, which prevents the dye from leaching into
an aqueous environment, particularly in case of the deprotonated form;
(iii) a low charge of the deprotonated form (1−), which is
expected to minimize the effect of the ionic strength on the sensing
properties.

Keeping practical applications in mind (in which
accessibility
of the indicators is very important) we decided to employ the second
method for preparation of the unsymmetrical dyes. In this approach,
condensation of two different nitrochalcones results in a mixture
of the aimed unsymmetrical aza-BODIPY and two symmetrical derivatives
(Scheme 1), which are easily separated via
chromatography on silica gel. The starting compounds for the synthesis
were the diaryl α,β-unsaturated ketones (chalcones) that
are either commercially available (for the synthesis of 1, 5, 7, and 8) or prepared
by Claisen–Schmidt condensation (for the synthesis of 2–4, 6). These were synthesized
from the corresponding aldehyde and acetophenone with KOH as a base
in all cases, except for 6, for which NaH was used. The
Michael addition of nitromethane to the chalcones, with KOH as base,33 yields the 1,3-diaryl-4-nitrobutan-1-ones in
essentially quantitative yields after aqueous workup, which were then
used without further purification. Condensation with ammonium acetate
in refluxing butanol gave the azadipyrromethenes via a cascade of
events (in situ formation of the pyrrole and corresponding nitrosopyrrole
and subsequent condensation of those two entities). The obtained mixture
was purified by chromatography with hexane/dichloromethane in the
case of 1–6 or toluene/dichloromethane
in case of 7 and 8. Finally, complexation
of the azadipyrromethenes with boron trifluoride gave the aza-BODIPYs
in good yields.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of aza-BODIPY Probes
Photophysical Properties
The new aza-BODIPY compounds
were dissolved in an EtOH/aqueous buffer mixture (1:1), and their
spectroscopic properties were investigated (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information, Table 1). The absorption of the probes bearing a hydroxyl group in
the p-position (R1) of Ar4 is rather similar
(668–677 nm). The shortest wavelengths of the absorption maxima
are observed for 5 and 6 (656 and 650 nm,
respectively). These values are very close to the tetraphenyl-substituted
aza-BODIPY chromophore lacking any substituents (650 nm).32 The absorption of 7 (bearing a
methoxy group in the p-position of the Ar3 ring) is bathochromically
shifted ∼20 nm as compared with 1. On the other
hand, introduction of the second methoxy group in the p-position of
the Ar2 ring (8) results in very minor changes
compared with 7.

These data indicate pronounced
conjugation of the Ar3 and Ar4 rings with the
aza-BODIPY chromophore and the absence of such conjugation for the
Ar1 and Ar2 rings. This conjugation can be caused
by a hydrogen bond between the fluorine atom and the hydrogen atom
located in the o-positon of Ar3 and Ar4 rings.
Evidently, the electron-donating substituents (−OH or O–CH3) in the p-position of the Ar3 and Ar4 rings result in the bathochromic shift of the absorption spectrum
but have no effect on the spectral properties if located in the Ar1 and Ar2 rings. As expected, the hydroxyl group
in the m-position of the Ar4 has virtually no effect on
the spectral properties. The molar absorption coefficients for all
aza-BODIPY derivatives are in the 70 000–90 000
M–1 cm–1 range.

It should
be mentioned that precision of determination of molar
absorptivities as well as fluorescence quantum yields can be affected
by inpurities of the probes. Although all the indicators were obtained
as single crystals, several indicators show solvent impurities in
the 1H NMR spectrum. As revealed by crystallographic study
of 8 (Figure S2 of the Supporting
Information), this is explained by incorporation of solvent
molecules (tetrahydrofurane and hexane) into the crystal structure.
Evidently, this slightly affects the calculated molar absorption coefficients.
For instance, the crystals of 8 contain one molecule
of tetrahydrofurane per each molecule of the dye, and this results
in the reduction of molar absorption coefficients by about 8.8%.

The trend observed in absorption maxima was the same for fluorescence
emission maxima (Table 1). The emission maxima
of the probes bearing a hydroxyl group in the p-position (R1) of Ar4 were located between 699 and 714 nm. The compounds 5 and 6 clearly showed a hypsochromic shift (676
and 691 nm, respectively), and the emission of 7 and 8 was shifted bathochromically (721 and 722 nm, respectively)
as compared with the parent compound 1. The trends in
the absorption and fluorescence maxima of indicators in hydrogel D4
mirrored those in solution with an additional bathochromic shift of
∼15 nm (Table 1).

The fluorescence
quantum yields (QYs) of most indicators were very
similar (0.14–0.17 in tetrahydrofurane, Table 1). Again, the dyes 5 and 6 represent
a notable exception as they exhibited significantly lower quantum
yields. As can be seen, all the values are lower in EtOH/aqueous buffer.
Although very low concentrations of the dyes were used (<1.5 ×
10–6 M), some aggregation of the dyes in EtOH/water
mixture cannot be excluded. On the other hand, lower quantum yields
in this media can be explained by more efficient radiationless deactivation
involving O–H vibrations. It should be mentioned that the QYs
of most reported NIR-emitting dyes are generally lower than for those
emitting in the visible part of the spectrum. In summary, the photophysical
properties of the new aza-BODIPY derivatives retain most of the advantages
of the aza-BODIPY fluorophores (except for 5 and 6), including narrow bandwidth, high molar absorption coefficient,
and acceptable fluorescence quantum yields.

a For the protonated form.

pH-Sensing Properties
pKa values of the new probes were determined both in ethanol/aqueous
buffered solution (1:1) and in a hydrogel D4 film from the absorption
measurements. As can be seen, the absorption spectra shift bathochromically
upon deprotonation of the hydroxyl group in all cases except for 6 as a result of the absence of conjugation with the aza-BODIPY
core (Figure 1, Table 1). Notably, the absorption spectrum of deprotonated 5 is rather unusual and shows two peaks (Figure 1b). The pKa values determined at two
ionic strengths of the solution (0.02 and 0.15 M) were very similar
(Table 2). Such low cross-sensitivity to the
ionic strength is explained by the low charge of the indicator molecule
(0 and −1 for the protonated and deprotonated forms, respectively).

The pKa of the aza-BODIPY derivatives
can be tuned over a wide range by introducing electron-withdrawing/donating
(remote) neighboring functionalities or changing the position of the
hydroxyl group. If probe 1 (with pKa of 8.38) is substituted at the m-position with a chlorine
atom, the pKa drops to 7.01 (2). When (inductively) electron-donating methyl groups are introduced
in the m-positions, the pKa is 8.47 for one methyl group (3) and 8.05 for two methyl
groups (4). The increased acidity of a dimethyl-substituted
derivative is surprising, but can be explained by the difficulties
of formation of the solvent adduct due to steric hindrances. If a
hydroxyl group is introduced in the p-position of the Ar1 aryl ring instead of the Ar4 aryl ring, the pKa increases to 9.68 (5). This is
very close to the pKa value of phenol
(pKa = 10),34 which indicates the absence of the conjugation with the aza-BODIPY
core. This observation is in good agreement with the trends obtained
from the absorption spectra. A drastically high pKa of 6 (10.88) compared with the pKa of parent compound 1 (8.38) was
attributed to the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between
the hydroxyl group and the neighboring fluorine atom. Introduction
of a remote electron-donating substituent (methoxy group) in the p-position
of the Ar3 ring (7) slightly increases the
pKa value (by about 0.3 units), relative
to the parent compound 1. Evidently, the second methoxy
group in the p-position on the Ar2 aryl ring (8) has less effect on the pKa value. Effects
observed in this study are in line with the electron-withdrawing (or
-donating) power of the neighboring (remote) substituents. In summary,
pH indicators with tailored pKa values
can be realized, and the indicators can be easily adapted to particular
applications.

The pKa values determined
in this study
differ significantly from the reported pKa of 6.9 of a phenolic derivative with a hydroxyl group in the p-position
of the Ar4 ring (similar to the compound 1 in our study),26 possibly because of
different media used by Murtagh et al. for the calibration of the
pH indicator (nonionic surfactant) and higher concentration of the
dye in these micelles. As will be demonstrated in the following, the
concentration of the indicators is rather critical for determination
of apparent pKa values via fluorescence
measurements.

The fluorescence of the indicators is quenched upon
deprotonation
(Figure 2), which is attributed to efficient
photoinduced electron transfer.35−37 In fact, no emission is detected
for the deprotonated form of the dyes. The apparent pKa values (pK `a) obtained
from the emission measurements in solution are very close to those
determined from the absorption spectra (Table 2).

Figure 2 pH dependence of fluorescence for 2 (1.41 × 10–6 M) in ethanol/aqueous buffer solution (1:1) and the
corresponding calibration curve (insert).

Optical pH sensors were prepared by noncovalent
entrapment of the
indicators in the hydrogel D4 matrix, which is a highly proton-permeable,
uncharged polyurethane derivative with a water uptake capacity of
about 50%. The pKa values obtained for
the sensing materials from the absorption measurements were very close
to those obtained for the solutions of the indicators (Table 2). Unexpectedly, the apparent pKa values in D4 as derived from fluorescence data were
0.5–1 pH units lower than those obtained from absorption data
(Table 2). This discrepancy can be explained
by the fact that the concentration of the indicator is much higher
in the hydrogel than in the solution. Therefore, the dye molecules
are close enough to enable Förster resonance energy transfer
(FRET) from the protonated to the deprotonated form (Figure S3 of
the Supporting Information). Considering
that FRET is concentration-dependent, this offers another possibility
of tuning the dynamic range of the materials. In fact, pḰa values derived from the fluorescence data are
lower for higher concentration of the indicators in hydrogel D4 (e.g.,
pḰa of 6.65, 6.14, 6.03, and 5.89
for the sensor films containing 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 1% of the indicator 2), Supporting Information Figure
S3c. The pḰa values obtained from
the absorption measurements (Supporting Information Figure S10b) are 6.92, 6.83, 7.04, and 7.32 for the same concentrations.
This increase may be due to different localization patterns of the
dye in hydrogel D4, which is known to be composed of the hydrophilic
and hydrophobic regions.

We compared the pH-sensing properties
of the complexes and the
respective ligands. The ligands were virtually nonfluorescent, possibly
due to their nonplanar structure. However, distinct changes in the
absorption spectra were observed (Figure S4a of the Supporting Information). The pKa values were ∼1 unit higher than for the corresponding complexes
(Supporting Information Figure S4b). For
example, the pKa values were 8.35 and
7.00 for 1 and 2, but 9.39 and 7.97 for
the corresponding ligands. This effect is likely due in part to the
lower degree of the π-conjugation between the phenolic substituents
and the chromophore core (which is reflected by the smaller shift
between the λmax of both forms of the dye compared
with the corresponding complexes). The electron-withdrawing effect
of the BF2 group can also contribute here. Despite the
absence of fluorescence, the nonchelated dyes can be promising as
absorption-based indicators.

Dye leaching out of the sensing
matrix may be a problem in the
case of physically entrapped indicators. It was tested in the case
of 1 by monitoring the absorption of the sensing foils.
No evident leaching into the aqueous solution was detectable for the
protonated form of the dye. In the case of the charged deprotonated
form, the decrease in the absorption was very low (0.8% per 24 h,
Figure S5 of the Supporting Information), which is within the experimental error. Consequently, leaching
is not critical for the investigated sensors due to the pronounced
hydrophobicity of the indicator systems.

Photostability
Photostability is a very important parameter
for all optical chemosensors. We investigated solutions of the new
pH dyes in dimethylformamide under continuous illumination with an
ultrabright 642-nm LED array. Figure 3 demonstrates
the photodegradation profiles for the new indicators and for seminaphthorhodafluor
decyl ester (SNARF-DE), which is used for comparison. The aza-BODIPY
probes were significantly more photostable (about 30-fold) than SNARF-DE
under identical conditions. In fact, after 2.5 h of illumination,
only 1–8% of the dyes was decomposed compared with SNARF-DE,
which degrades almost completely after 60 min of irradiation. The
photostability trend for aza-BODIPY probes was 6 > 3 > 4 >
1–2
∼ 7 > 5–8 (Figure S6 of the Supporting
Information). The electron-donating substituents in the aryl
rings Ar1 and Ar2 seem to be responsible for
decreased photostability; nevertheless, new pH dyes retain excellent
photostability of aza-BODIPY dyes,38 which
makes them particularly suitable for long-duration measurements.

pH probes and SNARF-DE in dimethylformamide determined from the absorption
measurements.

Dual-Lifetime Referenced pH Sensor
Fluorescence intensity
is a parameter that is easy to measure, but it is influenced by a
number of factors, such as the intensity and light field of the excitation
source, the sensitivity of the photodetector, and the coloration and
turbidity of the measuring media. In contrast, measurements of fluorescence
decay time, which is a self-referenced parameter, normally require
complicated and expensive equipment. Ratiometric sensing and dual
lifetime referencing are popular alternatives. In the latter approach,
a referenced material having a long luminescence decay time (typically
in the microseconds time domain) is added, and the overall phase shifts
are measured in the frequency domain.39 Since good spectral compatibility (both for excitation and for emission)
is essential, a recently reported inorganic phosphor, chromium(III)-doped
gadolinium aluminum borate (Cr-GAB)28 is
an excellent candidate for this purpose; its luminescence decay times
of about 100 μs, and high chemical and photochemical inertness
make it particularly attractive. The spectral compatibility of the
indicator (in its protonated form) and the referenced phosphor is
very good (Figure 4) because both are efficiently
excited by red LEDs and emit in the same spectral window.

The
resulting pH-sensing material is compatible with a commercially available
fiber-optic phase oxygen meter (Firesting from Pyroscience), which
was used for measurements (λexc ∼ 620 nm).
The “sensing chemistry” applied on the tip of a glass
optical fiber included 0.1% w/w of indicator 1 and 66%
w/w Cr-GAB particles and 33% w/w of hydrogel D4. Different concentrations
of indicator and Cr-GAB particles were tested to ensure optimal phase
shift dynamics (data not shown). Figure 4c
shows a calibration plot of the cotangents of the phase angle, cot
Φ vs pH for the DLR pH-sensing material. The calibration showed
an inflection point at pH 8.12, which is very close to the apparent
pKa value obtained from the spectroscopic
investigations. Photostability of the indicator at the fiber optic
tip was monitored by applying 5 times stronger light intensity and
10 times longer integration times than in the standard settings. For
the acidic form, no evident photobleaching was observed after 2000
measurement points, which corresponds to 100 000 measurement
points in the standard settings (Figure S7 of ESI). A very small drift of the phase angle (0.2°) was
observed in the basic conditions for the same measurement time. Nevertheless,
it can be concluded that the fiber-optic sensors possess excellent
photostability and can be used for prolonged measurements without
recalibration.

Application in Marine Biology
The new pH sensing materials
operate in significantly different dynamic ranges and are, therefore,
suitable for a variety of important applications. For example, the
apparent pK′a values of the indicators 2 and 4 make them particularly suitable for biotechnological
and biological applications, respectively. On the other side, the
apparent pK′a of about 8 found
for indicator 1 almost ideally matches the pH of the
seawater. This new sensing material thus provides a promising alternative
to the state-of-the-art optical sensors for seawater pH measurements,
which rely on fluorescein derivatives and possess poor photostability.40,41 We demonstrated this applicability in marine biology by measuring
the pH in corals with a fiber-optic pH optode based on the DLR material
described above (Figure 5). The pH in corals
is affected by both the photosynthetic activity of the algal symbionts
in the host tissue, which tend to increase the pH due to their phototsynthetic
fixation of inorganic carbon, and the respiratory activity of the
coral host cells and hetrotrophic bacteria associated with the coral,
the activity of which tends to decrease pH. Although most pH measurements
in corals have focused on the exposed tissues,42 the pH conditions in the gastric cavity (i.e., the coral
stomach) are largely unknown; yet, such measurements are highly relevant
to understand the microbial processes going on inside corals. Our
pH measurements showed a pH gradient of almost 1 pH unit from the
coral mouth and into the deepest part of the coral just above the
calcium carbonate skeleton (Figure 5b). Evidently,
the pH in these parts of the coral was not affected by photosynthetic
activity, which was also seen by the absence of any accumulation of
O2 (data not shown).

pH optode based on 1 and Cr-GAB inserted into the mouth
opening of a single polyp

an irradiance of ∼150 μmol photons m–2 s–1. (B) pH profile in the gastric cavity of the
coral showing a pH decrease at increasing distance from the mouth

Conclusion
In conclusion, we prepared and characterized
a series of NIR fluorescent
pH indicators with potential to suit a diverse range of analytical
applications. pH-sensitive functional aza-BODIPY derivatives were
obtained via a simple reaction route starting from commercially available
compounds. Except for probes 5 and 6, the
new indicators retain the advantages of aza-BODIPY fluorescent probes,
such as good brightness and excellent photostability. Variations in
both the substitution pattern and the position of hydroxyl functionality
allowed manipulation of pKa values over
a wide range, providing valuable information that can be used for
future rational design of the indicator systems. The new sensors have
high potential for a variety of biotechnological, biological, environmental,
etc. applications. As an example, monitoring of pH inside coral polyps
was demonstrated. Ongoing work concerns the covalent immobilization
of the indicators into the polymeric network, which will completely
suppress their leaching, migration, and aggregation and can lead to
even better shelf life stability and operating time of the optical
sensors.
