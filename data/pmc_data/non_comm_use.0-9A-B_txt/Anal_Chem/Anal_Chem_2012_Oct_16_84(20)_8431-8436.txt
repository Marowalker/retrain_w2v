Recent advances in peptide-based (bottom-up) quantitative
proteomics
and bioinformatics have opened unprecedented opportunities for extensive
investigation of cellular proteomes and their dynamics. Here we discuss
two approaches currently used to investigate the global dynamics of
phosphorylation based on the isolation of phosphorylated proteins
or peptides. We evaluate the accuracy of these methodologies to grasp
the global dynamics of phosphorylation, and we raise awareness on
ambiguities inherent to these analyses. We conclude that further development
of targeted approaches should prevent inaccurate conclusions about
the nature of biological regulations and in particular kinase-substrate
networks.

Mass spectrometry (MS)-based
proteomics is a fast-growing research field with constant improvement
in sensitivity, enhanced data acquisition speed, and targeted analysis
capabilities coupled with ever-refined bioinformatics for automated
data analysis.1 This rapid expansion is
fostered by the quest to understand the mechanistic bases of biological
systems behavior in health and disease.

In addition to deep
proteome identification, quantification by
MS is crucial in comparative studies (e.g., wild type vs mutant; pharmacological
perturbation). MS-based quantification relies on the comparison of
the intensity of peptides in a single or separate samples depending
on whether biosynthetic2 and chemical labeling3 or label-free quantification4 is employed, respectively. Such an analysis allows one
to detect and quantify with sufficient accuracy relative and absolute
protein abundance,2,4b dynamics of posttranslational
modification (PTM),5 and protein–protein
interactions,6 which may accompany changes
in the functional state of a cell. The most widely used peptide-based
quantitation that allows all the aforementioned quantitative assessment
of biological systems is the stable isotope labeling by amino acids
in cell culture (SILAC).2,7 In SILAC, differentially
labeled peptides are discernible in MS by their mass-to-charge ratio
and their intensity that is a measure of the relative peptide abundance
in various conditions. For isolated phosphoproteins, the relative
protein abundance is estimated by combining quantification of all
its detected constituent peptides. In contrast, selectively enriched
phosphopeptides quantitation reports abundance changes for individual
sites. Both types of analysis allow monitoring global changes in protein
phosphorylation from cells in different functional states. The results
of such global investigations are usually documented in databases5a,8 that constitute a rich source of information accessible to biologists
and biomedical researchers carrying out targeted genetics and biomedical
studies on individual proteins or cellular functions and to bioinformaticians
and mathematicians to model signaling9 and
kinase-substrate networks.10 It is therefore
vital to ensure both the accuracy of the data generated and the confidence
in their interpretation so that correct conclusions on functional
mechanisms can be drawn. Indeed, although sophisticated bioinformatics
is deployed to reach the highest confidence of proteomic identification
and quantification,11 important ambiguities
in data interpretation persists; the observed increase, decrease,
or absence of changes in the abundance of peptide phosphorylation
need to be interpreted carefully. Here we highlight evident and more
recondite ambiguities by discussing how the data from the above-mentioned
workflows and the often-combinatorial nature of PTMs may lead to misinterpretations.
Further development of peptide-based targeted proteomic analysis12 and its systematic combination with global phosphoproteomic
surveys could remove ambiguities and strengthen biological conclusions.

Quantifying Protein Phosphorylation
Protein phosphorylation
can be quantified by isolating phosphoproteins
or phosphopeptides (Figure 1). Phosphorylated
proteins can be effectively enriched by antiphospho-tyrosine antibodies
(anti-pY Abs) or by protein domains that bind to either phospho-tyrosines
(e.g., Src homology 2 (SH2) domain6c) or
to phospho-serines/-threonines (e.g., 14-3-3 proteins;13 (FHA) domain14). Captured phosphoproteins
are then subjected to protease digestion (usually trypsin) and liquid
chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) analysis
(Figure 1). Changes in phosphoprotein abundance
occurring, for instance, during cell stimulation are computed by averaging
the variation in all detected peptides from a given protein whether
modified or unmodified (Figure 1). In contrast,
quantitative assessment of phosphorylation changes in selectively
enriched peptides entails a supposedly unbiased enrichment of all
types of phosphorylation (pS/T/Y), e.g., by TiO2 or IMAC
(Figure 1) and usually allows monitoring a
larger panel of phosphorylated peptides, hence, a wider palette of
cellular functions regulated by phosphorylation. In both workflows,
temporal dynamics of phosphorylation can be determined directly from
the data for cellular activation of short time spans (0 < t < 30 min), during which the contribution of de novo protein synthesis is negligible. However, for longer
time spans the contribution of newly synthetized proteins needs to
be monitored in parallel.15

Figure 1 Quantitative analysis
of phosphorylation. Phosphorylation can be
quantified based on the isolation of phosphorylated proteins or peptides.
At the protein level (at the left), changes in temporal abundance
(0 < t < 30) subsequent to IP using anti-pY
Ab are an average of all its identified constituent peptides (identified
peptides in red used for quantification can be modified or not). Site-specific
resolution could be achieved when analyzing enriched phosphopeptides
from SCX fractions using TiO2 (titanium oxide nanobeads)
or immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography (IMAC).

Each analytical workflow has its strengths and
weaknesses. Particularly,
quantification based on the isolation of phosphoprotein leads to more
robust statistics for identification and quantification (based on
at least three peptides) while the analysis of selectively enriched
phosphopeptides has higher resolution power for precise localization
and quantification of the modification at the single amino acid (site)
level (Figure 1).

Below, we discuss in
detail potential limitations and drawbacks
of these two approaches one should be aware of and suggest how to
address them, by MS-based targeted experiments.

Quantification Based on Phosphoprotein Isolation
Several
studies,7,16 including ours,17 have attempted to quantify changes in protein tyrosine phosphorylation
during cellular activation in different systems. As shown in Figure 1 (left side), this approach is often based on selective
isolation of pY-proteins by anti-pY Ab prior to proteolysis and MS.
Because anti-pY immune-isolation can be almost quantitative (e.g.,
most of pY-proteins are captured17), changes
in relative abundance of the isolated pY-proteins at various phases
of cellular activation can be assumed to represent quantitative changes
in phosphorylation.7,17

On the basis of our own
experience, a number of considerations can be made on these procedures.
We noticed that mild conditions of cell lysis and fast anti-pY immuneprecipitations
isolate not only pY-phosphorylated but also non-pY-phosphorylated
proteins.17 The latter may have variant
or invariant profiles of activation. In the group with variant profiles,
the nonphosphorylated proteins are most often the actual interactors
of phosphorylated proteins with closely related profiles. This occurs
since large protein ensembles can be formed through intricate connectivity
established by modular protein–protein interaction domains
and protein adaptors (e.g., SH2, PTB, SH3, WW, BRCT domains or 14-3-3-
and GRB2-family proteins). The large excess and relatively high affinity
of the anti-pY Ab generally used in these experiments may be expected
to dissociate pY-mediated protein complexes during immune-isolation.
However, highly cooperative binding through multiple domains (e.g.,
SH2 and phosphorylation-independent association) may resist interferences
by detergent and anti-pY Ab. Isolation of stimulation-induced protein
complexes, rather than individual pY-phosphorylated proteins, can
be advantageous for information-rich gathering on biological functions
of unknown proteins,17 provided that nonspecific
co-isolation is excluded by rigorous negative controls and/or by self-evident
biological incongruity. Binding after cell lysis of proteins extraneous
to such large complexes cannot be formally excluded, though it is
much more likely to occur with the matrix (Ab and beads) used for
the isolation.18 In most cases, contaminants
will be discarded due to their invariant profiles during cell stimulation
and/or inconsistent variation in different biological replicas. However,
it is important to notice that invariant profiles may contain in some
cases proteins known by other approaches (e.g., pY immunoblot) to
undergo substantial increase in phosphorylation upon cell stimulation.
This is illustrated in Figure 2 for the CD3-TCR
complex;17 variation in the abundance of
phosphorylated CD3 subunits measured after total pY immune-isolation
is smaller than the variation of the selectively enriched tyrosine
phosphorylated peptide derived from the TCR/CD3-ζ complex. In
this instance, the unexpectedly weak increase in CD3-TCR phosphorylation
seen by MS could be attributed to the limited access of antibodies
to pY sites. Indeed, after TCR stimulation, tyrosine phosphorylation
of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM) of the
CD3-ζ complex, part of a bulky CD3-TCR multimer, recruits ZAP-70
via the nanomolar-range affinity of its tandem SH2 domains, which
hampers the pY residues from complete reaction with anti-pY Abs. Therefore,
for such complexes, immuno-isolation would not be quantitative, and
the increase in the phosphorylation of individual components could
not be accurately appreciated by quantitative MS.

Figure 2 The accessibility of
pY residues interferes with the accurate measurement
of phosphoprotein abundance. The average variation of the anti-pY
purified CD3 subunits has lower variation than expected, as shown
by the 5-fold variation in the selectively enriched phosphopeptide
of CD3ζ.

Thus, while very abundant information concerning
phosphorylation
changes in many proteins during cellular signaling can be gathered
by quantifying isolated pY-proteins, caution should be exercised in
the interpretation of the data. It is important to keep in mind that
these data have indicative value directing further corroborative studies.

Quantification of Peptide/Site-Specific Phosphorylation
MS-based quantification of phospho-peptides/-sites appears to be
the method of choice to study global protein phosphorylation dynamics.
Indeed, it achieves better structural resolution (quantifies single
peptides/sites) and high sensitivity in monitoring a large array of
phosphorylations involved in many cellular functions and removes aforementioned
ambiguities associated with the analysis based on the isolation of
pY-proteins. As shown in Figure 1 (right side),
the current workflow consists in reducing the complexity of the total
protein digest by strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX) followed
by phosphopeptide enrichment using TiO2 (or IMAC) nanobeads
prior to LC–MS/MS measurement.

However, in spite of the
attractiveness of the possibility to correlate many cellular phosphorylation
changes to modulation in cellular functions, intrinsic limitation
of this large-scale approach need to be underlined.

To start
with, identification and quantification are often based
on only a few or, at times, just one peptide(s) so that peptide-specific
quantification may suffer from weak statistical power. Some enriched
phosphopeptides might not be detectable by LC–MS/MS due to
their physicochemical properties (digestibility, size, hydrophobicity,
isoelectric point, efficiency of ionization, fragmentation behavior,
etc.) thus limiting detection and/or quantification of some important
phosphoproteins. We observed this behavior in adapter proteins such
as SLP-76 and LAT, both critical in TCR signaling networks, that can
be quantified by protein anti-pY IP, while remain refractory to the
peptide-specific quantitation. For instance, pY sites in SLP-76 remained
undetectable even after using various single or combination of multiple
proteases [unstated details in ref (19)]. In such cases, protein isolation prior to
quantitation remains the method of choice. Importantly, quantitating
variations at single sites is not always possible and 30% of detected
peptides carry multiple phosphorylations,5a for which measuring contribution of each site to the total variation
of phosphopeptide may not be feasible. Given the importance of multiple
phosphorylations in biological contexts, analysis and interpretation
of such peptides need particular attention.12c

Phosphorylation-dependent cellular signaling is activated
by stimuli
that perturb kinase-phosphatase equilibrium. However, in MS data an
increase in the abundance of phosphorylated peptides/sites does not
necessarily imply higher phosphoprotein stoichiometry (phosphorylated
fraction of a particular protein) as a consequence of higher kinase
activity. This point is illustrated in Figure 3A (for the ease of argumentation only short activation times are
considered so that de novo protein synthesis can
be ignored). An apparent increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation
of a peptide (in red) may result from PTK activity on the unphosphorylated
peptide (green). However, it could equally result from dephosphorylation
(e.g., by a serine phosphatase in the example of Figure 3A) of pre-existing doubly phosphorylated peptide (in blue).
Similarly, a decrease in the abundance of a singly phosphorylated
peptide (Figure 3B, the pY containing peptide,
in red) might equally result from the phosphorylation of an additional
site (e.g., by a serine/threonine kinase) or the dephosphorylation
of the existing site (e.g., by a tyrosine phosphatase). In both cases,
to find out which reaction is actually responsible for the apparent
change in peptide abundance (Figure 3, increase
in part A, decrease in part B), one should quantify all species of
the same peptide (modified and unmodified, as shown in Figure 3C,D) by a targeted approach,12b such as multiple reaction monitoring (MRM).12a Hypothetically, if reactions R2 and R2′
were true then we would expect to see quantitation profiles for each
peptide as depicted in parts C and D of Figure 3, respectively. Such an experiment would clarify that the increase
(Figure 3A) and decrease (Figure 3B) were due to phosphatase (Figure 3C) and kinase (Figure 3D) reactions, respectively.
Importantly, in such hypothetical cases and contrary
to an intuitively apparent conclusion from the examples in Figure 3A,B, the stoichiometry of protein tyrosine phosphorylation
has not changed.

Figure 3 The interpretation of the dynamics of site-specific phosphorylation
is a source of ambiguities. An increase in the phosphorylation of
a peptide (A, the peptide in red) can result not only from PTK action
(kinase reaction R1, green to red) but also from that of a serine
phosphatase (ppt reaction R2, blue to red). Note that in R1 the increase
in tyrosine phosphorylation represents the actual change in phosphorylation
stoichiometry at the protein level but not in R2. Similarly, a decrease
in phosphorylation of a phosphopeptide (B, the pY containing peptide
in red) could result from the action of pY phosphatase (reaction R1′,
blue to red. It represents the actual change in the stoichiometry
of protein tyrosine phosphorylation) or a serine/threonine kinase
(reaction R2′, blue to green). Multiple hypothetical possibilities
(PTK or serine/threonine kinase or serine/threonine or tyrosine phosphatase)
depicted in parts A and B can be distinguished only if abundance of
all peptide species is quantified by a targeted approach such as MRM.
If phosphatase reaction (R2) in part A and kinase (R2′) in
part B were actually taking place, then all peptides would have profiles
as depicted in parts C and D, respectively. Peptides and their corresponding
profiles (fold change versus time) are represented by the same colors.

We suspect that other PTMs, in addition to protein
phosphorylation
illustrated in aforementioned hypothetical cases, might also contribute
to such biases, for instance, ubiquitination and the consequential
proteasomal degradation, which have important consequences for biological
conclusions drawn from these investigations. As shown in Figure3 D,C, an accurate picture of signaling activities
could be captured only if all possible species of phosphorylated peptides
and their unmodified counterparts are simultaneously quantified. Therefore,
we think that combining targeted analysis using for instance MRM might
prove beneficial following the first global exploratory phase of the
study.

Conclusions and Outlook
Quantitative analysis of the
entire protein phosphorylation or
its individual phosphopeptides by mass spectrometry allows capture
snapshots of the signaling systems at various stimulation times. This
allows identifying proteins and/or sites involved in regulating cellular
signaling at different times and locations. However, identification
of phosphorylation by protein isolation bears some uncertainty as
to the actual phosphorylation of the identified proteins and fails
to detect some real changes. On the other hand, measuring PTMs dynamics
at the single amino acid resolution could be also a challenging task.
Both approaches could lead in some cases to mistaken conclusions,
and therefore further improvement and development of new and complementary
analytical approaches may be necessary.

A key issue in large-scale
proteomic analysis is the accuracy and
precision of the changes measured. Estimating the accuracy depends
on the approach used and the scale of the analysis. For instance MS-based
analysis of phospho-form distribution of a protein is more accurate
than NMR and immunobloting.20 However it
is challenging to measure the accuracy in large-scale analysis. In
contrast, independent of the scale of the analysis, very high precision
can be achieved by MS in multiple measurements of the same sample,
which decreases when comparing multiple biological replicas, (Duskek,
O.; Acuto, O.; Salek, M., to be published elsewhere). Overall, in
large-scale analysis a realistic aim is to determine the global trend
in relative changes and its consistency over multiple biological replicas.

Inherent ambiguities exist concerning the analysis of protein phosphorylation
when using peptide-based (bottom-up) proteomics; identification and
quantification is achieved at the peptide level and then combined
into protein-level information. This analytical concept is subject
to ambiguities related to multiple PTMs bearing isoforms that could
prevent accurate conclusions to be drawn. New developments in large-scale
analysis of intact proteins21 open new
avenues paving the road to solve weaknesses related to peptide-based
proteomics.

We argue that weaknesses in the analysis of protein
phosphorylation,
in particular, and in general for other PTMs, can be alleviated by
corroborative MS-based targeted analysis. Considering all possible
species of stimulation-responsive phosphopeptides (multiple phosphorylation)
would allow one to comprehensively portray the interplay between kinase
and phosphatase networks in cellular signaling systems. In this context,
without necessarily embarking into large-scale analysis, it would
be of high interest to exploit already existing phosphoproteomics
data, documented in various databases,5a,8b which can
constitute a starting point to undertake targeted studies. A significant
application would be to design standardize MRM assays targeting particular
signaling pathways in comparative studies using diseased mice models.
Signaling pathways in mammalian cells can also be quantitatively studied
by phospho-flow22 and mass flow cytometry
technologies23 that offer the advantage
of single-cell analysis. However, realistically these approaches and
other more classical biochemical and genetic methodologies remain
restricted to a handful of target proteins for which reagents such
as, e.g., good antibodies are available. Instead, targeted phosphoproteomics
would allow monitoring hundreds of phosphosites involved in particular
pathways, thus decisively contributing to unambiguously identify defects
causing the onset of the signaling pathologies.
