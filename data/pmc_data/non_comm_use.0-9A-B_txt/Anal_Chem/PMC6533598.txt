Protein
footprinting coupled with mass spectrometry is being increasingly
used for the study of protein interactions and conformations. The
hydroxyl radical footprinting method, fast photochemical oxidation
of proteins (FPOP), utilizes hydroxyl radicals to oxidatively modify
solvent accessible amino acids. Here, we describe the further development
of FPOP for protein structural analysis in vivo (IV-FPOP) with Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans, part
of the nematode family, are used as model systems for many human diseases.
The ability to perform structural studies in these worms would provide
insight into the role of structure in disease pathogenesis. Many parameters
were optimized for labeling within the worms including the microfluidic
flow system and hydrogen peroxide concentration. IV-FPOP was able
to modify several hundred proteins in various organs within the worms.
The method successfully probed solvent accessibility similarily to
in vitro FPOP, demonstrating its potential for use as a structural
technique in a multiorgan system. The coupling of the method with
mass spectrometry allows for amino-acid-residue-level structural information,
a higher resolution than currently available in vivo methods.

==== Body
Human diseases
often involve
dynamic interactions between molecular and cellular systems that influence
pathogenesis. An understanding of these interactions is essential
for the development of treatments for diseases. Studies, both in vitro
and in cell cultures, have provided a wealth of information on protein
conformations and interactions, but the interplay between the cellular
systems of an in vivo system cannot be capitulated in these less complex
systems. Cell-based studies are limited by the use of only one cell
type in a monolayer culture. In some cases, substances that produce
a response in a whole animal do not produce a response in isolated
cells or tissues.1 The lack of whole animal
physiology, interacting organ systems, and cell type variety limits
the information that can be provided from monolayer cell culture.
The use of three-dimensional cell culture aims to ease this issue
by providing the ability to culture multiple cell types in a single
dish. Still, these model systems do not demonstrate the effect of
a multiorgan system on pathogenesis, highlighting the need to continue
to use animals as models for human disease. Owing to limitations in
currently available in vivo structural methods, the study of protein
structure in animal models requires the development of new analytical
tools.

Protein footprinting coupled with mass spectrometry is
being increasingly
used to study protein interactions and conformations. Footprinting
methods utilize chemical labels to modify proteins, and these modifications
are detected and quantified by mass spectrometry (MS). Methods such
as hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) have
been instrumental in studying the higher order structure of proteins.2−4 However, because HDX-MS utilizes a reversible label, it would be
difficult for this method to be used for in vivo studies that require
time-consuming postlabeling sample processing. Another protein footprinting
method, hydroxyl radical protein footprinting (HRPF), employs an irreversible
label. HRPF utilizes hydroxyl radicals to oxidatively modify the side
chains of solvent accessible amino acids.5 Solvent accessibility, which changes upon protein perturbation,
is assessed by performing a differential experiment. HRPF techniques
have been successfully used in vitro to identify protein–ligand
interaction sites,6−9 protein–protein interactions sites,10,11 and regions of conformational change.12,13 The HRPF method,
fast photochemical oxidation of proteins (FPOP), generates hydroxyl
radicals via excimer laser (248 nm) photolysis of H2O2.14 Recently, the FPOP method has
been extended for in-cell studies,15,16 demonstrating
the flexibility of this method for studying complex systems. In-cell
FPOP (IC-FPOP) takes into account the role macromolecular crowding
plays in protein interactions and conformations.

Here, we report
the extension of FPOP for in vivo protein structural
analysis in C. elegans. C. elegans, a member of the nematode family, is widely used to study a variety
of biological processes including gene regulation, aging, metabolism,
cell signaling, and apoptosis.17 Genome
sequencing of C. elegans has revealed that ∼80%
of its proteins are conserved between worms and vertebrates.18 The neuronal signal pathways and cell biological
principles are conserved between C. elegans and humans.19 This conservation contributes to the efficacy
of using C. elegans as a model system for human disease.
An important characteristic of C. elegans, which
makes them especially suited for in vivo FPOP (IV-FPOP), is that they
are transparent to the laser light, allowing it to penetrate the animal.20C. elegans have the ability
to intake H2O2 by both passive and active diffusion
through cuticle absorption and ingestion.21 A major advantage of using C. elegans as an animal
model is the ease of growth and maintenance.

The ability of
FPOP to oxidatively modify 19 of the 20 amino acids
makes it advantageous for in vivo analysis.22,23 This signifies that multiple proteins, regardless of amino-acid
sequence, can be oxidatively modified in the worms. In addition, the
irreversible nature of the ligand means that the worms can be processed,
including worm lysis, protein precipitation, and protein digestion,
for MS analysis without the loss of the label. The current benchmark
for in vivo analysis of proteins is fluorescence imaging, which relies
on fusing the protein of interest to a fluorescent protein for experiments.24 In some cases, this can lead to experimental
error, because the fluorescent protein can affect the function and
subcellular localization of the protein of interest.25,26 An advantage of IV-FPOP is the protein of interest does not need
to be tagged prior to analysis, so it is studied in its native conformation.
In addition, fluorescence-based methods do not have the resolution
to characterize conformational changes and interaction sites on the
amino-acid level. FPOP coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry
is capable of providing data on the amino-acid-residue and subresidue
level.10,27 Furthermore, MS-based proteomic methods
have provided information on thousands of proteins in lysate samples,
making IV-FPOP applicable for proteome-wide structural biology, where
structural information can be obtained on hundreds of proteins across
the proteome in a single experiment.28,29 In contrast,
fluorescence imaging can only analyze one or two proteins in a single
experiment.

Here, we describe the IV-FPOP workflow, which includes
the flow
of worms, laser irradiation, and LC/MS/MS analysis (Figure 1), and detail the optimization
of conditions to successfully perform FPOP in C. elegans. We demonstrate the ability to oxidatively modify proteins within
multiple tissues of the worm, signifying that IV-FPOP would be efficacious
in studying proteins in an animal model for human disease. IV-FPOP
has the potential to fill a gap in knowledge in studying protein structure
directly in animals.

Figure 1 In vivo FPOP workflow. Worms are grown to the fourth larvae
stage
(L4) on nematode growth media plates. For IV-FPOP, worms are flowed
through a 250 μm fused silica capillary in the presence of H2O2, and radicals are generated using a 248 nm wavelength
excimer laser. Immediately after irradiation, excess H2O2 and radicals are quenched, worms are lysed, the protein
extract is digested and prepared for mass spectrometry analysis, and
the extent of FPOP modifications is calculated for proteins of interest.

Experimental Section
Nematode and Bacterial
Culture
Nematodes were maintained
using standard laboratory procedures at 20 °C on bacterial lawns
containing either OP50 or NA22 E. coli on nematode
growth medium (NGM) or 8P plates, respectively.30C. elegans strain BY205 (Pdat-1::GFP)
were a kind gift from Dr. Richard Nass at Indiana University School
of Medicine.

In Vivo FPOP
L4 larvae were harvested
as described
above. Each sample was prepared with approximatively 10 000
worms in 3 mL of M9 buffer. The flow system was adapted from a homemade
flow system described by Konnerman et al.31,32 In this flow system, two fused silica capillaries (Polymicro Technologies)
of 250 μm inner diameter (ID) and 360 μm outer diameter
(OD) were connected to a third capillary of the same ID. The three
capillaries are connected by a homemade tee made of FEP tubing (IDEX
Heath & Science, 1/16″ OD × 0.02″ ID) with
a dead volume of ∼3 nL. Two 5 mL syringes were each connected
to a fused silica capillary and advanced by a syringe pump (KD Scientific,
Legato Model 101). Worms were kept separated from H2O2 and mixed at the tee just prior to IV-FPOP, for approximately
1.5 s. Worms were mixed in the syringe using a VP710 tumble stirrer
(V&P Scientific) with six stir discs (VP722fF, V&P Scientific)
to prevent settling. The final H2O2 concentrations
used were 20, 60, 100, 140, and 200 mM. The KrF excimer laser (GAM
Laser Inc.) at a wavelength of 248 nm was set to pulse frequencies
of 20 and 50 Hz, and the pump flow was set at 147.26 and 375.53 μL/min,
respectively. The laser energy was 150 ± 2.32 mJ with no exclusion
volume and a pulse width of 2.55 mm. Worms were collected in a 15
mL conical tube containing the quench buffer. DMSO (1%) was added
to the quench buffer to inhibit methionine sulfoxide reductase. Labeling
studies were performed in biological duplicates, each in technical
triplicates with an equal number of controls (no laser irradiation,
and no peroxide and no laser irradiation).

Protein Extraction and
Digestion
Following IV-FPOP,
the worm samples were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 rpm, and
the quench buffer was removed. Pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer
(8 M urea, 0.5% SDS, 50 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF)
and transferred to clean microcentrifuge tubes. Protein homogenate
was sonicated for 10 s, followed by 60 s of incubation on ice. Small
aliquots (2 μL) of homogenate were observed under a stereomicroscope
(Olympus SSZ Model, 45×
magnification) to check for homogenization. The sonication cycle was
repeated until homogenization was complete. After homogenization,
samples were centrifuged at 400 × g for 4 min
at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to a clean microcentrifuge
tube. BenzNuclease (ACROBiosystems) was added to the lysate following
the manufacturer’s protocol. The protein lysate was reduced
with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 45 min at 50 °C, cooled down
at room temperature for 10 min, and then alkylated with 20 mM iodoacetamide
(IAA) for 20 min in the dark at room temperature. Protein lysate was
purified by an overnight acetone precipitation. The sample was resuspended
in 25 mM Tris HCl pH 8 and quantified using a BCA assay (Thermo Scientific).
An overnight trypsin (Thermo Scientific) digestion of 100 μg
of protein was performed at a final ratio of 50:1 of protein/enzyme
at 37 °C. The digestion was quenched using 5% formic acid. Peptides
were dried by cold trap centrifugation and then resuspended with 0.1%
formic acid at final concentration 10 μg/μL.

LC/MS/MS Analysis
Digested samples (50 μg) were
loaded onto an M-Class C18 trap column (Waters) and washed for 10
min with 0.1% formic acid at 15 μL/min with an M-Class Acquity
liquid chromatograph. Peptides were eluted and separated on a silica
capillary column that was packed in-house with C18 reverse phase material
(Aqua, 0.075 × 20 mm, 5 μm, 125 A, Phenomenex). The gradient
was pumped at 300 nL/min for 120 min as follows: 0–1 min, 3%
solvent B (acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid); 2–90 min, 10–45%
B; 100–105 min, 100% B; 106–120 min, 3% B. Eluted peptides
were analyzed under positive ion mode nanoflow electrospray using
an Orbitrap Lumos Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The
mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode.
MS1 spectra were acquired from over an m/z range of 375–1500 with 60 000 resolution,
with a dynamic exclusion of 60 s. The AGC target was set at 5.5e5
with a maximum injection time of 50 ms and 5.0E4 intensity threshold.
Ions with charge states of +1 and >6 were ejected. MS2 ions were
subjected
to high-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) (32% normalized collision
energy) and detected in the orbitrap with 15 000 resolution
and a 5.0e4 AGC target.

Data Analysis
Data analysis was
performed as previously
described.33 Briefly, raw files were analyzed
using Proteome Discover 2.2 software (Thermo Scientific) using Sequest
version 1.4. All files were searched against the Uniprot C.
elegans database containing 26 794 sequences. Sequest
was searched with a fragment mass tolerance of 0.02 Da and a precursor
mass tolerance of 10 ppm. All known hydroxyl radical side-chain modifications34,35 were searched as variable modifications. Carbamidomethylation of
cysteine was specified as a fixed modification. The enzyme specificity
was set to trypsin allowing for one missed cleavage. A target decoy
database search was performed. Peptide identification was established
at a greater than 95% confidence (medium) and 99% confidence (high)
for both peptide- and residue-level analysis, respectively. The false
discovery rate (FDR) was set at 1%. All data was exported to Excel
and analyzed summarized using the PowerPivot add-in. The extent of
oxidation per peptide or residue was determined according to the following
equation  1  For peptide-level analysis,
EIC area modified is the area of the peptide with a modified residue,
and EIC area is the total area of the same peptide with and without
the modified residue. For residue-level analysis, EIC area modified
is the area of the residue with a modified residue, and EIC area is
the total area of the same residue with and without the modified residue.

Label-free quantification was calculated by the summation of each
protein associated peptide using the following equation 2  TSA is
the total sample abundance
area for identified proteins in laser irradiated samples in biological
replicates 1 and 2.

Results and Discussion
Microfluidic System Design
To limit over oxidation,
both in vitro and IC-FPOP utilize flow to transport the sample past
the laser aperture, ensuring a single exposure to irradiation.14,16 However, the increased size of C. elegans heightens
the possibility of clogging in the flow system. This is compounded
by the tendency of C. elegans to curl their bodies
for locomotion. To overcome these issues, a new microfluidic system,
adapted from Konermann et al.,31 was used
for in vivo labeling (Figure 2a). FEP tubing, with a dead volume of ∼3 nL, was used
as a sleeve to connect two capillaries of equal inner (ID) and outer
diameter (OD) to a third capillary of equal diameter (Figure S1). One capillary is used to flow H2O2, while the second is used to flow the C. elegans. The two streams are mixed at the sleeve junction
and flowed together through the third capillary. By constructing the
flow system without physical connectors, clogging is reduced. Keeping
worms separate from peroxide until just prior to laser irradiation
limits peroxide clearance by the various biological mechanisms utilized
by different cell types.36

in vivo labeling in C. elegans. (a) Schematic of
IV-FPOP flow system. Worms are kept separated

of worms after the flow system for two biological replicates (BR)
with fused silica of 250 (gray) and 150 (black) μm ID. Error
bars are calculated from the standard deviation across technical triplicates.

Two capillary IDs, 150 and 250
μm, were tested to determine
optimal size for worm recovery. The 150 μm size tubing was previously
used for in vitro and parts of the IC-FPOP flow system. The 250 μm
capillary size was chosen based on a commercially available flow-sorting
system for C. elegans.37 Worms were weighed and then flowed through the system constructed
with either 150 or 250 μm ID tubing as they would for an FPOP
experiment but without laser irradiation. The worms were collected,
dried, and weighed again to calculate percent recovery. A comparison
of the two IDs indicates that the 250 μm capillary recovered
63–89% across two biological replicates (BR) (Figure 2b). This is ∼3-fold
higher recovery than with the 150 μm ID capillary, where only
22–31% is recovered over two BR (Figure 2b). The larger diameter capillary allows
for better unimpeded flow for the worms (Figure S1b,c). For subsequent IV-FPOP experiments, the 250 μm
diameter capillaries were used.

Viability of C.
elegans in the Presence of
H2O2
For IV-FPOP to effectively monitor
biologically relevant interactions and conformations, it is imperative
to label proteins in live worms. One means to limit worm death is
to perform IV-FPOP promptly after harvesting worms, as food source
depletion could be lethal. Another is to limit the H2O2 exposure time prior to laser irradiation. Previous studies
have demonstrated that the effects of H2O2 on
worm viability are heavily dependent on incubation time. In a study
testing the effects of time and peroxide concentration, continuous
incubation with 1 or 5 mM H2O2 for 24 or 4 h,
respectively, was lethal for the worms.38 However, Kumsta et al. demonstrated that after incubation with 6
or 10 mM H2O2 for 30 min, greater than 95% of
worms survived, and worm life span was not altered.39 By using the flow system described above with a 250 μm
ID and a flow rate of 375 or 147 μL/min, dependent on the laser
frequency, worms are exposed to peroxide for only 1.5 or 3.8 s, respectively,
prior to laser irradiation. Even with this short incubation time,
it remains necessary to determine whether the peroxide is lethal to
the worms, especially at the higher concentrations of H2O2 required for IV-FPOP.

The fluorescent dye propidium
iodide (PI) was used to ascertain the viability of C. elegans in the presence of H2O2. PI intercalates the
DNA of dead worms, while viable worms expel the dye.40 Several different peroxide concentrations, from 20 to 200
mM, were tested. Worms were incubated with peroxide for 30 s, a 20-fold
longer time than actual IV-FPOP exposure. After incubation, 20 mM N′-dimethylthiourea (DMTU) and 20 mM N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone (PBN) were used
to quench H2O2 and OH radicals, respectively.
Fluorescence imaging reveals some minor worm death (Figure 3a); yet, even at high peroxide
concentrations, the worm death is significantly lower than that with
incubation with methanol (Figure 3), which is known to kill C. elegans.40 Comparison of the bright field image
of worms to the fluorescence image after incubation indicates that
for all concentrations, the proportion of dead worms is very low (Figure 3a). The percent viability
of H2O2 treated worms is similar to that of
the positive control of untreated worms (<2% loss of viability),
even at concentrations as high as 200 mM (Figure 3b). There is not a statistically significant
difference between the various concentrations, indicating at this
short time frame, concentration-dependence is minimal. The negligent
worm death in all concentrations shows that IV-FPOP is probing live
worms even at high H2O2 concentrations.

of worms using nine different H2O2 concentrations
for two biological replicates. Negative control worms are in the presence
of 50% methanol, and positive control worms have no H2O2 added. Error bars are calculated from the standard deviation
across technical triplicates.

In Vivo FPOP Oxidatively Modifies Proteins within Different
Organs and Tissues
Various concentrations of H2O2 were tested to determine the best concentration for
labeling proteins in worms. To calculate the number of modified proteins,
background oxidation was taken into account (Figure S2). Modified proteins were identified at all H2O2 concentrations with 200 mM proving the highest number
with 199 proteins modified in BR2 (Figure S3). To improve the number of modified proteins, we increased the laser
frequency from 20 to 50 Hz to provide multiple exposures across the
body of the worms. Under these conditions and using 200 mM H2O2, a total of 545 proteins across two BR were oxidatively
modified, approximately 3-fold greater than the 191 proteins modified
across two BR at a laser frequency of 20 Hz (Figure 4a). An increased number of modified proteins
were observed in BR2. This was attributed to a higher abundance of
expressed proteins in BR2, leading to an increased number of modifications
(Figure S4a,b). Also, there were only 36
proteins commonly modified in both BR. This discrepancy could be attributed
to gene variability between BR samples, which has previously been
linked to protein abundances.41

modifies proteins within C. elegans. (a) Venn diagram
of modified proteins at 20 and 50 Hz laser frequencies.
(b) Pie chart of oxidatively modified proteins within different body
systems.

The potential of IV-FPOP lies
in its possible use as a general
strategy to simultaneously study a wide variety of proteins in C. elegans. This would allow the method to probe the role
of protein interactions and conformations in disease states within
the relevant tissue or organ. For this, IV-FPOP must demonstrate the
ability to modify proteins in all body systems within the worm. To
this end, we wanted to analyze the location of the modified proteins.
Each of the 545 proteins modified at 50 Hz was matched to its primary
gene through UniProt and rematched to its corresponding organ and
tissue using the online Gene Search tool by The Genome BC C. elegans Gene Expression Consortium.42 All the various body systems within the worm are represented
by a modified protein (Figure 4b and Table S1). The majority are
found in the nervous, alimentary, and muscle systems; although proteins
from the epithelial, reproductive, and excretory systems are also
represented (Figure 4b). Because C. elegans can ingest H2O2, it is understandable that the majority of the modified proteins
are found in the alimentary system. A large number are also found
in the nervous system. C. elegans can also uptake
H2O2 through the skin, and once absorbed, neurons
are the initial body system the peroxide will encounter. The presence
of oxidatively modified proteins in various body systems demonstrates
that IV-FPOP would be useful in the study of proteins within various
organs and tissues.

IV-FPOP Probes Solvent Accessibility in C. elegans
FPOP has been shown to report on protein
solvent accessibility
in vitro14,43 and in cell.44 To determine if IV-FPOP can do so within a multiorgan system, we
looked at the peptide-level oxidation pattern of the myosin chaperone
protein UNC-45. Although only two modified peptides were observed
for UNC-45, it was chosen for further study, because a crystal structure
is available for the C. elegans form of this protein
alone (PDB ID 5MZU(45)) and in complex with a heat shock protein
90 (Hsp90) peptide (PDB ID 4I2Z46). Only
multiresidue modified peptides were observed (Figure 5b), rendering the contribution of the different
residues to the overall extent of modification indistinguishable.
For UNC-45, peptides 669–680 and 698–706 were oxidatively
modified. In 669–680, MS/MS analysis indicates that residues
E675, E677, and D678 were modified each with a mass shift of −43.99
(Figure 5a,b), corresponding
to a loss of CO2, a modification unique to carboxylic acids.35,47 Glu and Asp have low reactivity with hydroxyl radicals (2.3 ×
108 and 7.5 × 107 M–1 s–1, respectively48), in contrast to other higher reactive residues such as Tyr, Phe,
and Leu (1.3 × 1010, 6.9 × 109, and
1.7 × 109 M–1 s–1, respectively48) located within the same
peptide. Although these residues have higher reactivity, they are
not modified in peptide 669–680 by IV-FPOP. The calculated
residue-level solvent accessible surface area (SASA) reveals that
E675, E677, and D678 have a higher SASA than the highly reactive residues,
with E677 and D678 being over 90% accessible (Table 1). The less reactive residues are preferentially
modified in good correlation with their increased solvent accessibility,
indicating that IV-FPOP is assessing solvent accessibility and could
be used to detect solvent accessible changes similar to in vitro FPOP.
This trend is not as straightforward in peptide 698–706, where
only low-reactive amino acids, including Ala (7.7 × 107)48 and Lys (3.5 × 108),48 are present. It also includes a Ser
and two Gly, residues seldom modified in a hydroxyl radical footprinting
experiment.49 In this peptide, two carboxylic
acids, E702 and E698, are modified with a mass shift of −43.99
(Figure 5b). E702 is
highly solvent accessible with a 92.2% SASA, whereas E698 is also
exposed with 45% SASA (Table 1).

(c) The calculated ln(PF) for the Hsp90 oxidatively modified residues,
R697, M698, E699, and E700. (d) Tandem MS spectra for R697, M698,
E699, and E700 showing a +16 FPOP modification.

To further correlate IV-FPOP to solvent accessibility, the
residue-level
extent of modification for Hsp90 was calculated using eq 1. High-quality MS/MS data allowed
single residue modification analysis (Figure 5c,d). The modification of four residues within
the UNC-45-binding peptide on Hsp90, R697, M698, E699, and E700 was
confirmed by MS/MS analysis (Figure 5d). To normalize for variations in reactivity with
hydroxyl radicals, a protection factor (ln(PF)) was calculated from
the extent of FPOP modification.33,50 Higher ln(PF)
values are indicative of buried regions, whereas lower ln(PF) values
indicate more accessible regions.50 A comparison
of the ln(PF) indicates that E699 and E700 are more exposed than R697,
whereas M698 is the most buried of the residues (Figure 5c). The Hsp90-bound UNC-45
structure shows M698 interacting with UNC-45 more extensively than
R697, E699, and E700 (Figure 5a, inset). Calculations confirm that M698 has the lowest solvent
accessibility of the four residues, whereas R697, E699, and E700 have
similar SASA values (Table 1). In another example from the same data set, the peptide-level
analysis of actin was performed. Actin has been previously studied
by in vitro HRPF51 as well as by IC-FPOP.44 The IV-FPOP labeling of actin was compared to
the in vitro and in-cell data. For IV-FPOP, four peptides in actin
were oxidatively modified (Figure 6a). When the ln(PF) values of these peptides are compared
to actin modification data from IC-FPOP and in vitro HRFP, the level
of oxidation correlates well. The strong correlation of the data is
interesting considering that in vivo actin can bind multiple proteins
and can exist in a monomeric or polymeric state. This data provides
direct evidence that IV-FPOP can probe solvent accessibility similar
to in vitro studies. Both in vitro HRPF and IC-FPOP have a higher
number of modified peptides than IV-FPOP (Figure 6b). This may be due to a lower number of
modifications by IV-FPOP or a lack of identification by LC/MS/MS.
An increase in hydrogen peroxide concentration may increase the number
of modifications, and the use of fractionation or two-dimensional
chromatography may increase the identification of oxidatively modified
peptides

Figure 6 Comparison of actin modification. Oxidation of actin correlates
with solvent accessibility through IV-FPOP. (a) ln(PF) of peptides
modified by IV-FPOP, IC-FPOP (adapted from Espino et al.44), and in vitro HRPF (adapted from Guan et al.51). (b) Peptides oxidatively modified with in
vitro HRPF, IC-FPOP, and IV-FPOP (blue), IV-FPOP and in vitro HRFP
only (yellow), in vitro HRFP and IC-FPOP only (green), and HRFP only
(magenta).

Conclusions
We
report the development of a new method to study protein structure
directly in an animal model for human disease. By optimizing conditions
for performing FPOP in C. elegans, the method can
be used to study the role that changes in protein interactions and
conformational states play in disease pathogenesis. Variations in
H2O2 concentration and laser frequency improve
the number of proteins that can be modified by the method. The ability
of IV-FPOP to modify proteins in the different body systems within
the worm makes it useful as a general strategy that can used to study
a wide variety of proteins regardless of their organ location. The
correlation between the extent of FPOP modification with solvent accessible
surface area and in vitro HRPF studies indicates the ability of the
method to successfully probe solvent accessibility within the worm.
This demonstrates the future possibility of using the method to study
a protein system in vivo by comparing the labeling pattern in multiple
states including perturbations such as ligand-binding, mutations,
growth conditions, signaling, and the physiological state of the organism.
Information on the amino-acid-residue level can be obtained from the
method, which is higher resolution than other in vivo structural methods.
Ongoing development of the method to increase the number of modified
proteins and the number of modifications per protein will further
increase its utility as a method for in vivo structural biology. Taken
together, this data demonstrates the potential of the method in being
used to study interactions and conformations in an animal model for
human disease.
