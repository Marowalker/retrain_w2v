The speed and throughput
of analytical platforms has been a driving
force in recent years in the “omics” technologies and
while great strides have been accomplished in both chromatography
and mass spectrometry, data analysis times have not benefited at the
same pace. Even though personal computers have become more powerful,
data transfer times still represent a bottleneck in data processing
because of the increasingly complex data files and studies with a
greater number of samples. To meet the demand of analyzing hundreds
to thousands of samples within a given experiment, we have developed
a data streaming platform, XCMS Stream, which capitalizes on the acquisition
time to compress and stream recently acquired data files to data processing
servers, mimicking just-in-time production strategies from the manufacturing
industry. The utility of this XCMS Online-based technology is demonstrated
here in the analysis of T cell metabolism and other large-scale metabolomic
studies. A large scale example on a 1000 sample data set demonstrated
a 10 000-fold time savings, reducing data analysis time from
days to minutes. Further, XCMS Stream has the capability to increase
the efficiency of downstream biochemical dependent data acquisition
(BDDA) analysis by initiating data conversion and data processing
on subsets of data acquired, expanding its application beyond data
transfer to smart preliminary data decision-making prior to full acquisition.

==== Body
Data streaming
has been adopted
by mobile device applications especially in the entertainment and
electronic gaming industries; however, its broader application to
science has been largely overlooked. For example, while data acquisition
technologies, computing power and software have significantly evolved
over the last 10 years, especially in the area of mass spectrometry,1−3 the ability to interrogate multidimensional data during acquisition
typically requires manual evaluation of a few parameters, resulting
in incomprehensive and subjective assessments, not only of the data
but also of the quality of the analysis. Consequently, waiting until
a full data set has been acquired to proceed with data analysis is
usually the common practice. Nevertheless, the ability to survey recently
acquired discrete data packets from large-scale data sets pertaining
to LC-MS, NMR, or omic data in general can be limited by the location
of the generated data files because of the use of centralized data
analysis servers and in recent years, the more common situation of
sharing laboratory equipment in interdisciplinary research.4 We previously introduced the concept of data
streaming applications that were focused on cloud computing capabilities,5 and while cloud-based processing and storage
of data offers several distinct advantages, the utility streaming
can have even broader applications to the scientific community when
interconnected to downstream data processing and analysis.

Highly
complex multidimensional data and an increase in data file
sizes have spurred the transition from instrumentation computer workstations
to both on-site servers and workstations for data analysis. This typically
requires the manual transfer of data files via portable media (e.g.,
external hard drives), not only decreasing the efficiency of the process
but also increasing the wait time for results. For example, the transfer
time of 50 GB of data (a common size for metabolomic studies) with
an external hard drive at a copy speed of 30 MB/s would take 1 h (30
min to transfer the data from an instrument computer to an external
hard drive and another 30 min to copy to the destination computer’s
hard drive). Furthermore, data file conversion is a heavy computational
task, which ultimately slows down personal computers. For instance,
the conversion of 1 GB raw LC-MS data file from a proprietary format
to an open format used by data processing and data analysis bioinformatic
tools can take up to 30 min for dedicated multicore servers using
software such as ProteoWizard.6 Thus, it
is not uncommon to perform these tasks overnight to avoid hampering
other functions performed during normal working hours. However, these
time limitations can be overcome by simultaneously compressing and
streaming data files to processing servers while data acquisition
(LC-MS) is underway. This capability, depicted in Figure 1A and B, exploits the time
after the first sample has been analyzed until the completion of the
entire sample list, maximizing the efficiency of the analysis and
decreasing the time needed for the generation of results. Furthermore,
manually uploading different files as data sets can be a long and
tedious task, which is drastically increased with a larger number
of data files (Figure 1C). Another advantage of a streaming platform is coupling data processing
and analysis capabilities. This removes the necessity to physically
start the process (submit “Job” in XCMS Online) once
all data files have been streamed and assigned to their respective
data sets, which reduces the total time needed for the generation
of results after data acquisition.

Figure 1 Theoretical time comparison of analytical
process with data streaming
capabilities. (A) Traditional process of data acquisition followed
by data conversion and uploading to server for data processing and
analysis before obtaining results. (B) Alternative process utilizing
real-time data streaming. Files are compressed and streamed to server
after acquisition while other data files are being acquired, reducing
the time needed for obtaining results. (C) Direct data upload time
comparison for different number of samples between with and without
streaming capabilities (assuming 1 min upload time for each data file
for both streaming and no streaming scenarios).

Herein, we describe XCMS Stream, a data streaming platform
for
real-time data processing and data analysis and compare this platform
to alternative manual uploading using a LC-MS metabolic study of human
CD4 and CD8 T cells, as well as recently reported data from a 1000
sample data set.

Experimental Section
Development of XCMS Stream
XCMS Stream was developed
using the programming language C# and it has been tested on Windows
7 with.Net 4.5 framework (Redmond, WA). HTTPS are used for the communication
with XCMS Online,7 which has been written
using the programming languages JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, and PHP and
it connects to MySQL database. MD5 checksum was added for file integrity
corroboration throughout the streaming process.

Sample Preparation
and LC-MS Analysis
T Cell Isolation
Human CD4 and CD8
T cells were purified
from the peripheral blood of healthy donors by Ficoll-Paque density
gradient centrifugation. Fresh blood was diluted 1:1 in PBS, layered
onto Ficoll-Paque Premium 1.084 (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) and centrifuged
at 400 × g for 40 min without braking. Peripheral
blood mononuclear cells were isolated, and subsequently washed 3×
in Isolation Buffer (PBS, 0.5% BSA, 2 mM EDTA). CD4 or CD8 T cells
were purified using negative isolation kits (Miltenyi, Bergisch Gladbach,
Germany) on an AutoMACS Pro Separator (Miltenyi) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Cell purity was assessed by flow cytometry
on a MACSQuant Analyzer 10 (Miltenyi) and cell counting performed
using a hemocytometer. Cells were washed in PBS, pelleted, and flash
frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Metabolite Extraction and
LC-MS Analysis
CD4 and CD8
T cells samples were prepared as previously described.8 Briefly, cell pellets (∼106 cells) were
extracted with 1 mL of cold MeOH/ACN/H2O (2:2:1, v/v) solvent
mixture, vortexed for 30 s, and incubated in liquid nitrogen for 1
min. After thawing at room temperature, the samples were sonicated
for 10 min. This cell lysis procedure of freezing and sonication was
repeated three times followed by incubation at −20 °C
for 1 h and centrifugation at 13 000 rpm and 4 °C for
protein precipitation. The supernatant was then evaporated to dryness
and reconstituted in 100 μL ACN/H2O (1:1, v/v) for
LC-MS analysis.

Analysis were performed with an HPLC system
(1200 series, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) coupled to an
Impact II Q-TOF (Bruker, Billerica, MA). Samples were analyzed using
a Luna Aminopropyl, 3 μm, 150 mm × 1.0 mm I.D. column (Phenomenex,
Torrance, CA). The mobile phase consisted of A = 10 mM ammonium acetate
and 10 mM ammonium hydroxide in 95% water and B = 95% acetonitrile.
A 60 min linear gradient was used with an injection volume of 8 μL.

XCMS Stream Workflow
The data streaming strategy described
here combines technology used mainly in the entertainment industry.
However, XCMS Stream adds to this existing technology by coupling
two data processing platforms and improves the efficiency of untargeted
biomolecular interrogation. A general overview of this strategy and
process is shown in Figure 2. Upon sample acquisition completion, the data file is compressed
(zipped) in order to reduce the streaming time by reducing the size
of the data file. The data file is first streamed to an auxiliary
server (XO Cloud), which acts as a buffer between XCMS Online7,9,10 and the acquisition computer
(instrumentation computer). XO Cloud temporarily stores all class
data files pertaining to the different data sets (e.g., triplicates
of WT and KO for pairwise analysis, grouped using masks) needed for
the selected data processing job. Subsequently, the data sets are
then uploaded to XCMS Online for automatic data conversion, data sets
creation and processing as selected in the XCMS Stream interface (HPLC,
qTOF, Homo sapiens, etc.). It should be noted that
the file compression, streaming and data sets collection in XO Cloud
occurs while data acquisition is still underway. Furthermore, as long
as all files needed for the selected job type (e.g., single, pairwise,
multigroup comparison, etc.) have been acquired and streamed to XO
Cloud, XCMS Online will automatically start with data processing and
data analysis while data is still being acquired for other data sets.

Figure 2 XCMS Stream
flowchart showing the general strategy for data streaming.
After the acquisition of each individual LC-MS run, the data file
is compressed before being streamed to reduce its size. XO Cloud serves
the purpose of “Data buffer” between streaming and “Job”
submission to XCMS Online. This is necessary because the data processing
and data analysis in XCMS Online cannot start without all files necessary
for the requested “Job”. Upon data upload completion
to XCMS Online, data processing and analysis can then take place.

XCMS Stream Interface
XCMS Stream allows for a simple
and intuitive solution to streaming large data files and performs
data processing and analysis automatically concurrent with data acquisition.
In its current version, XCMS Stream has four main settings areas (Figure 3) and for correct
connection to the respective servers, XCMS Online user’s email
address and password are needed to login. In “Directory”,
the folder where data files are being saved during acquisition as
well as the virtual location of the XO Cloud can be selected. Inputting
meta information about the run, such as column details, chromatography
or sample information is optional. In “Job Information”,
settings regarding the type of streaming and XCMS Online job are selected.
“Run Type” allows for two types of streaming capabilities: i) “Online”, which streams data files as soon
as the acquisition for each file is completed regardless of other
current acquisition jobs and ii) “Batch”,
which allows the automatic uploading of data files already generated.
The instrument manufacturer and the type of preionization separation
are settings selected in “Machine Type” and “Chromatography”
respectively. For XCMS Online data processing and analysis, the “Job
Type” option indicates which type of analysis should be performed
(single job, pairwise comparison and multigroup). Additionally, “Job
Parameters” such as type of LC (HPLC or UPLC) as well as type
of mass spectrometer (Q, q-TOF and trap instruments) and ionization
mode can be selected for already optimized data processing settings.
“Bio Sources” can be selected to look at metabolites
endogenous only to that specific species and its default setting is Homo sapiens.

Figure 3 XCMS Stream screenshot of user-friendly interface.
The “Directory”
section indicates where the files are stored. As an optional section,
the “Column Details” allows the data entry of specific
stationary phase information for the particular analysis. In “Job
Information”, the possibility to stream the data online or
offline can be selected, where online refers to data streaming while
other samples are being acquired and offline refers to data streaming
after all samples have been acquired. Furthermore, the selection of
single, pairwise and multigroup jobs are available as well as a “Bio
Source” option (H. sapiens is default). “Data
Information” is utilized for the determination of the number
of samples and when each data file is complete to start the streaming
process. Moreover, the file mask allows for correctly assignment of
each sample to a particular data set for the “Job” in
XCMSonline data processing and analysis.

In the “Data Information” section, the number
of
files to be streamed, the length of each chromatogram and the post
run times (column equilibration) are selected accordingly to configure
streaming times and protocols. Lastly, “Masks” (4 user
selected characters followed by “*”) are used to indicate
the relationship between data sets and data files. These same masks
must be added at the beginning of the filenames selected in the sample
list. Furthermore, quality control samples can be added to a job by
clicking and selecting them (highlighted in blue) and will not be
used for statistical analysis (Ctrl + click to unselect). Finally,
the intuitive green and red buttons start and stop the streaming process,
respectively.

Applications
To test the performance
and demonstrate
its capabilities, we selected an LC-MS metabolic study comparing CD4
and CD8 T cells isolated from different human donors. For this comparison,
10 samples were streamed during the acquisition of central carbon
metabolic profiling (3 GB each). In Figure 4A, the shorter time needed to obtain results
between online streaming and manual uploading can be appreciated.
The real-time data streaming during acquisition allowed for quick
turnaround of results only 4 h after completion of data acquisition.
In contrast, 18 h were needed with manual uploading to obtain results
(4.5 times longer). The differential time of 10 h corresponds to the
time between the completion of the LC-MS experiment and when the files
are manually uploaded to XCMS Online. In our study, data acquisition
was completed after working hours (∼8:00 PM), as it often is
the case. This immediately decreases the efficiency of the analysis,
due to the lag time before the files can be uploaded. The manual uploading
step (3.5 h) is considerably long and it can be attributed to the
lack of file compression and the direct uploading to XCMS Online,
which at the same time is converting the data files to mzML format.
This highlights the advantage of XO Cloud, which buffers the high
volume of data being received (streamed) with the XCMS Online processing
functions. Additionally, XCMS Stream’s capability to not only
transfer data but also start data processing represents a huge advantage
due to the fact that this can be done without having to physically
start the job in XCMS Online. This is especially beneficial in the
case of manual uploading being completed when users are performing
other tasks or during nonworking hours.

Figure 4 Time comparison between
XCMS Stream and manual data uploading for
the pairwise analysis of CD4 and CD8 human T cells and 1000 urine
samples from ref.11 (A) A Large time savings
are gained by “Online Streaming” with results being
generated only 4 h after data acquisition compared to “Manual
Uploading” (18h). Data dead time is the time after the completion
of data acquisition and data uploading for processing. (B) In “Batch
Streaming”, the data files are automatically uploaded to user
specific data sets and an XCMS Online job is generated. This is performed
after data acquisition is completed. The time savings of “Batch
Streaming” compared to “Manual Uploading” for
1000 urine samples is 5.7 days.

XCMS Stream’s real-time data processing and data analysis
capabilities can be applied to smart preliminary data decision -making
prior to full sample list acquisition by analyzing the data from the
first samples. For example, paired analyses of the pooled samples
(small aliquots from each sample are pooled to condition the column)
can provide information about reproducibility and stability of the
system by monitoring retention times shifts and ion intensity changes.
Additionally, in the case of a large number of samples, the sample
list can be setup so that the first samples can be compared against
each other and aid determine if enough differences are observed or
if the type of analysis is appropriate for the particular experiment.
Such information is extremely valuable before spending several days
acquiring fruitless data with expensive laboratory equipment.

The second streaming modality available in XCMS Stream, batch streaming,
was also compared in this study and for that we used the experimental
design of a previously published study by Lewis et al., where 1000 urine samples were analyzed using LC-MS (Figure 4B).11 In this modality, in contrast to online streaming, data files are
streamed to XO Cloud after all data files have been acquired. These
files can be located at computers both on the instrument or personal
computers used by users for data analysis. The distinct differences
between batch streaming and manual uploading are files are compressed
prior to streaming and all files are uploaded in a batch, independently
of which data sets they correspond to. Furthermore, the file conversion
takes place in the server after data streaming and, which drastically
reduces the burden of the acquisition computer. These differences,
though small, represent big advantages. For instance, using our T
cells comparison in the metabolic LC-MS experiments we determined
streaming and uploading times of 2.3 and 10.5 min per sample for streaming
and manual upload, respectively. These estimated times translate to
huge efficiency improvement by reducing the data transfer time from
7.3 to 1.6 days when batch streaming is used instead of traditional
manual uploading. Further, as mentioned above, it automatically started
data processing and analysis.

It should be noted that a conservative
number of samples was selected
in this comparison and the advantages of streaming grow with increasing
number of samples and time of analysis. For example, in the study
by Lewis et al., where 1000 urine samples were analyzed in a LC-MS
metabolomics profiling experiment.11 However,
other studies have analyzed considerable larger number of samples
(5000–10 000).12,13 To estimate time savings,
we extrapolated the different streaming and uploading times experimentally
determined, 2.3 and 10.5 min, respectively (Figure 5). These time savings cover a wide range
depending on the modality spanning a few minutes to 73 days and it
should be noted that a logarithmic scale was needed. The streaming
time in the online modality was as expected the same independently
of the number of samples, 2.5 min (streaming time for one sample).
Additionally, in batch streaming, large time savings are observed
for larger number of samples. For larger studies (1000 and 10 000),12,13 the data transfer times differences can represent time savings in
the range of 6–60 days, and given the direction of personalized
or precision medicine,14−16 it is safe to say the tendency of studies with large
sets of samples will remain. Moreover, the complexity of samples is
dramatically increasing, as metabolomics is surging to the forefront
of methodologies routinely employed to analyze highly complex biological
samples comprised of many hundreds of bacterial species, including
the metabolites from distal gut, skin, and oral microbiomes. While
the examples provided here focus on large sample numbers and the corresponding
savings in time, we likewise envision that the duration of analyses
of microbiome-derived metabolomic datasets will be vastly shortened
with the application of XCMS Stream.

XCMS Stream and manual
data uploading for large data sets. Data transfer time comparison
in days (logarithmic scale) for different number of samples between
online, batch streaming and manual uploading.

Conclusion
In summary, the development of XCMS Stream
allows users to increase
the efficiency of their analytical workflow by utilizing streaming
technology to reduce data transfer times. Previously, data acquisition
time was considered “useless” in terms of data processing
and analysis time. However, we demonstrate with both experimental
examples conducted in our laboratories and with previously published
large-scale studies, that streaming data files during acquisition
can provide dramatic times savings (hours to days). Furthermore, the
compression and streaming of files in batch mode significantly reduced
the total time in the analytical workflow of metabolomics studies.
We expect the XCMS Stream approach, freely available at https://xcmsonline.scripps.edu, to not only to be used in metabolomics studies but also to stimulate
researchers in other fields to implement streaming technology to their
workflows.
