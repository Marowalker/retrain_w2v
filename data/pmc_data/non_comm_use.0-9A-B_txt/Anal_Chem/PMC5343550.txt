To
improve point-of-care quantification using microchip capillary
electrophoresis (MCE), the chip-to-chip variabilities inherent in
disposable, single-use devices must be addressed. This work proposes
to integrate an internal standard (ISTD) into the microchip by adding
it to the background electrolyte (BGE) instead of the sample—thus
eliminating the need for additional sample manipulation, microchip
redesigns, and/or system expansions required for traditional ISTD
usage. Cs and Li ions were added as integrated ISTDs to the BGE, and
their effects on the reproducibility of Na quantification were explored.
Results were then compared to the conclusions of our previous publication
which used Cs and Li as traditional ISTDs. The in-house fabricated
microchips, electrophoretic protocols, and solution matrixes were
kept constant, allowing the proposed method to be reliably compared
to the traditional method. Using the integrated ISTDs, both Cs and
Li improved the Na peak area reproducibility approximately 2-fold,
to final RSD values of 2.2–4.7% (n = 900).
In contrast (to previous work), Cs as a traditional ISTD resulted
in final RSDs of 2.5–8.8%, while the traditional Li ISTD performed
poorly with RSDs of 6.3–14.2%. These findings suggest integrated
ISTDs are a viable method to improve the precision of disposable MCE
devices—giving matched or superior results to the traditional
method in this study while neither increasing system cost nor complexity.

==== Body
Recently,
microchip capillary
electrophoresis (MCE) has developed to a promising platform for point-of-care
diagnosis of small ions.1−4 Adding an internal standard (ISTD) to the sample
is a standard technique used to improve run-to-run quantification
in conventional capillary electrophoresis (CE)5−7 and MCE.8,9 In a recent paper, we demonstrated that adding an ISTD to
the sample can be used not only to improve run-to-run quantification,
but also improve chip-to-chip precision.10 The latter is crucial when disposable, one-use microchips are used—as
is common in point-of-care (POC) analysis. However, adding an ISTD
to the sample in POC analysis would require an extra sample preparation
step performed by either an unskilled operator or the device itself.
Integrating a microfluidic mixing system into the CE microchip would
introduce new error sources, increase system complexity, and raise
fabrication costs. Requiring an unskilled operator to mix the ISTD
with the sample would similarly introduce new error sources and increase
test complexity. These are severe limitations for a quantitative,
disposable microchip.

Instead of mixing with the sample, the
approach we take in this
work is to add an internal standard to the background electrolyte (BGE). It is well-known from literature that for each additional
ionic constituent added to the BGE, an additional system peak will
also be present.11−13 Although this phenomenon is basic knowledge within
the field, the literature does not report on the use of system peaks
for the purposes of improving quantitative measurements. The authors
of this study speculate that this is due to the complex nature of
system peaks and the fact that traditional ISTDs are readily available
for use by a skilled technician in a standard laboratory setting.
It is only when we try to address the problem of precise measurements
in disposable microchips used by unskilled operators that the potential
of using a reference system peak instead of a traditional ISTD becomes
attractive: no additional sample manipulation, microchip changes,
or system expansions are required with this method—which makes
it an ideal solution for POC applications.

Here, we present
a novel method to improve chip-to-chip precision
in disposable MCE devices whereby the ISTD-like component (further
referred to as the integrated ISTD ion) is added to the BGE instead
of to the sample. The resulting system peak area/height from the integrated
ISTD ion is then used to correct for different sources of system error
in the quantitative measurement, similar to a traditional ISTD peak.
We explore the effects of two integrated ISTDs (Cs and Li ions) on
the chip-to-chip reproducibility of Na quantification, using a data
set of 900 electropherograms collected from measuring five concentrations
of NaCl repeatedly on six microchips. The in-house fabricated microchips,
CE protocols, and reagents were the same as presented in our previous
publication,10 allowing us to draw reliable
conclusions about the viability of the new method. We thus compare
traditional ISTDs to integrated ISTDs.

Experimental Section
Microchip
CE System
This experiment set used the same
chip holders, electrophoretic methods, and equipment as in previous
work, to which the reader is referred for details.10

In brief, Borofloat glass CE chips were fabricated
in-house using the same principles as presented earlier.14 Channels 6 μm deep by 52 μm wide
were etched into the top glass plate, and 140 nm recessed platinum
electrodes were sputtered onto the bottom plate. The electrodes were
placed at the end of the separation channel, in contact with the fluid,
and 2 cm away from the 200 μm double-T intersection. After bonding
and dicing, each chip is 15 mm × 30 mm × 1.6 mm.

A
three-piece Delrin holder extended the powder-blasted reservoirs
from 4 μL to ∼60 μL and suspended four platinum
wires in the wells which were connected to the high-voltage supply
(CU 411, IBIS Technologies, Hengelo, The Netherlands). Two spring-loaded
pins further connected the thin-film conductivity electrodes to the
in-house built detector electronics. For high-voltage protocols and
further electronics details, please see previous work.10

Reagents
Stock solutions of 250
mM MES hydrate and
250 mM l-histidine (His), 0.05% (w/v) (hydroxypropyl)methylcellulose
(HPMC), 200 mM KCl, 100 mM CsCl, and 100 mM LiCl were prepared and
stored in the refrigerator. The MES–His stock was verified
to have a pH of ∼6.1 at room temperature after mixing. Aliquots
were used to prepare daily solutions of BGE: 100 mM MES–His
(pH 6.1), 0.01% (w/v) HPMC, 0.25 mM KCl, and 7.5 mM of each added
reference standard (CsCl and LiCl). This is the same BGE as presented
earlier10—sans the ISTD ions. Sample
solutions were also prepared from stock daily and contained 100 mM
MES–His, 0.01% HPMC, and one of five different concentrations
of NaCl (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mM; stock was 500 mM). All chemicals were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany), aside from the
LiCl stock solution which was graciously donated by Medimate (Enschede,
The Netherlands). Reagents were 99% grade or higher, and Milli-Q water
was used to mix all solutions.

Experimental Procedure
Six microfluidic chips were
analyzed thoroughly in our previous work, and the same six microchips
were used here. Between publications, each microchip was cleaned by
flowing 0.1 N NaOH and Milli-Q water through the chip for 10 and 15
min, respectively. The channels were then filled with BGE solution
and left for at least 90 min so that the surface chemistry of the
glass could adjust to the solution. The microchips were then flushed
with, and stored in, Milli-Q water.

One chip “load”
consists of five electrophoretic “runs”, or injection–separation
pairs, performed on the same aliquots of BGE and sample solution applied
to a microchip. Each NaCl analyte concentration (total, 5) was loaded
six times onto each microchip (total, 6); thus, 900 electropherograms
were collected for this data set.

Between chip loads, all reservoirs
were rinsed 3 times with Milli-Q
water. The buffer waste reservoir was then rinsed 3 times and filled
with BGE. This aliquot was then pulled into the microchip, displacing
the used BGE solution, via vacuum pressure applied to the other three
reservoirs. After 10 min the liquid was removed, and the remaining
three reservoirs were rinsed 3 times with BGE. Amounts of 55 μL
of BGE and sample were then applied to their respective reservoirs
immediately before running a new experiment.

Baseline Fit
Previously,10 the collected signal’s baseline was approximated
using a
moving median subtraction of 175 points (or 0.734 s at a data collection
rate of 238.42 Hz). This estimation was sufficient as all peaks of
interest in the electropherogram were positive and the baseline had
minimal curvature. Here, the electropherogram contains both negative
(integrated ISTD) and positive (analyte) peaks. The moving median
subtraction was found to have inadequate performance in estimating
the baseline, particularly across the integrated ISTD peaks, and negatively
impacted the repeatability of the measurement.

Thus, this work
uses a background correction (backcor) method as found on MATLAB’s
File Exchange and described in literature by Mazet et al.15 In short, the script applies a polynomial fit
to the background using one of four predefined functions, a user-defined
order, and a threshold setting which limits the influence of the peaks
on the estimation. A symmetric Huber function with a polynomial order
of 5 and a threshold of 0.01 was used here, which fits well to the
baseline (Figure S1). Peak areas were then
estimated using the full width at half-maximum (FWHM), and the migration
time was taken as the half-maximum time on the rising edge of the
peak. Additional methods for calculating the peak area were investigated,
including integrating the area under the peak and using the peak arrival
time (i.e., mobility) as a correction factor. The FWHM approximation
gave the best reproducibility.

Results and Discussion
Understanding
Integrated ISTD Peaks
In a basic capillary
electrophoresis separation, one can think of the channel containing
BGE and zones of different analyte ions moving at different mobilities
toward a detector. Additional zones consisting of only BGE constituents
can also appear with specific mobilities, and may deform analyte zones
migrating in their vicinity. As they are a function of the BGE system
itself, these regions are often referred to as “system zones”
or “eigenzones”.16 Mathematical
models and/or simulation programs, such as PeakMaster17 and Simul 5,18 are often used
to predict the mobilities and amplitudes of system peaks.

Integrated
ISTD peaks are denoted in this paper with quotations because they
are not moving analyte zones of Cs or Li ions, but rather the inverse:
they are depleted regions in the BGE where notably less Cs and Li
ions are present. Figure 1, illustrated using Simul 5,19 shows
this phenomenon. When the sample is electrokinetically injected (EKI)
into the microchip injection channel, the sample (de)stacks as it
crosses the stationary boundary into the BGE. Prior to separation,
the sample plug does not contain any Cs or Li ions—they are
completely displaced by the sample zone during EKI. This discontinuity
in the BGE (the sample plug) gives rise to two depleted-ion system
zones moving through the separation channel with a migration velocity
similar to that of the depleted ion.

Figure 1 Ionic concentration changes between moving
zones (peaks) passing
the detector and the BGE, simulated using Simul 5 (ref (19)). Cs and Li concentrations
change in all moving zones; however, their corresponding system peaks
constitute the most significant change for that ion.

However, it should be noted that, since these are
BGE constituents
(not analytes), these zones are not the only depleted regions for
that ion in the system: rather, they are the most significantly depleted.
This aspect differs from sample peaks, where each ion has only one
analyte region—though in this region the concentrations of
the BGE ions are also changed.

Integrated ISTDs: Mobility
Considering a BGE with multiple
co-ions A and C, and counterion B, the system peak due to the addition
of co-ion C can be derived from eq 40 of Štědrý
et al.20 to have a mobility λC of 1  where c is the analytical
concentration and μ is the ion’s mobility. This equation
assumes that the influence of H+ and OH– can be neglected, buffering ions A and B are half-ionized, and co-ion
C is entirely ionized—which is the case of the 100 mM MES–His
buffer and Cs or Li used as the integrated ISTD. With these values,
Štědrý’s eq 1 estimates the mobilities of the “Cs”
and “Li” peaks to be 8% smaller than if the ISTDs were
added to the sample. With more complicated BGEs, eq 1 may not apply; however, the mobility of the
integrated ISTD-related system peak is easily predictable using special
software.17 In any case, the mobility of
the system peak invoked by the presence of the integrated ISTD is
a well-defined quantity.

Integrated ISTDs: Peak Size
While
the mobilities of
system peaks (including the added standards) are dependent on the
BGE composition, the size of these peaks is strongly dependent on
both the BGE and the sample matrix.21Figure 2A plots five electropherograms
collected from the same chip with integrated ISTDs, each measuring
a different Na concentration. As the concentration of Na+ increases in the sample—also increasing the sample’s
conductivity and ionic strength—the “Cs” system
peak height becomes more negative and the “Li” system
peak less. With sample and BGE matrixes used here, the average size
change within a single chip is approximately 40% for “Cs”
and 25% for “Li” per 5 times increase in NaCl concentration.

Figure 2 Cs and
Li reference peaks change in area with analyte (Na) concentration,
both when added to the BGE (A) and when added to the sample (B). In
both figures, five electropherograms collected from the same microchip
are shown, each measuring a different NaCl concentration. Embedded
graphs plot the average normalized areas for the reference peaks on
each microchip, at each NaCl concentration, illustrating a general
downward/upward trend. The rate of change is much more pronounced
when Cs and Li are added to the BGE, as expected.

This behavior conflicts with the idea of a true internal
standard:
a substance which is different from the analyte of interest, but is
influenced by the sample preparation and measurement system in the
same way. It must be noted, however, that a perfect internal standard
(according to this definition) cannot exist in MCE devices which use
EKI methods. Ideally, the relative amount of injected analyte is fixed
and independent of time, provided that the sample is injected long
enough and is restricted from diffusing into the separation channel.22 Practically, a mobility bias still exists. While
the injected ions are assumed to have the same concentration ratio
with respect to each other, other constituents and properties of the
sample will influence the accuracy of that ratio.23 Pinching the sample in the injection phase, while preventing
diffusion, can also lead to stacking of ions with faster mobilities
in the sample plug.24Figure 2B similarly plots five electropherograms
collected from the same chip with traditional ISTDs and shows that
a slight decrease in the internal standard peak height is visible
as the NaCl concentration increases. The average change within a single
chip is approximately 8% for Cs and 4% for Li per 5 times increase
in NaCl concentration.

In spite of these sources of variability,
our previous work10 clearly demonstrated
that traditional ISTDs
are a means to improve precision in MCE. Thus, it is also of interest
to determine if integrated ISTDs can effectively improve the precision
of the measurement, despite their complex relationship with the sample
and BGE matrixes. On the basis of our knowledge of system peaks, injection
variation due to changes in sample properties would not expect to
be accounted for by the integrated ISTD approach. For example, a weak
electrolyte ISTD in the BGE would not correct for sample pH differences
around a weak analyte’s pKa. Injection
variation due to changes in BGE properties, channel dimensions, and
variations in sample plug formation would expect to be accounted for.
The next section investigates this, using simulations.

Simulations:
Microchip Channel Variances
Disposable
microchips suffer from variabilities that CE and MCE laboratory systems
do not since each chip differs and each chip is only used once. Slight
variance in channel depths and/or widths due to small fabrication
differences will result in different sample plug volumes, leading
to quantification errors. Thus, it is important to know if integrated
ISTDs can account for these variations on a theoretical level.

To investigate this, Simul 5 was used to simulate the same injected
sample with different plug widths (ignoring pinching effects). The
double-T intersection has a length of 0.2 mm, and six other widths
were analyzed between 0.15 and 0.25 mm. As expected, the Na analyte
peak area increases with sample plug width: the more sample present,
the more Na ions are also present (Figure 3A). Likewise, the integrated ISTDs also increase
in peak area with plug width: the more BGE that is displaced, the
larger the moving zones of missing Cs/Li ions are. The rate of change
for each peak, however, is different: slopes m are
Na = 2.09, “Cs” = 1.78, and “Li” = 1.34
[area/mm].

Figure 3 Variations in microchip channel dimensions were simulated by varying
the sample plug width in Simul 5. As expected, the Na analyte peak
area increases with sample plug width (A), which would lead to quantification
errors in disposable microchips. The peak area ratios (PARs) of Na
with both “Cs” and “Li”, however, remain
constant within 10% (B)—thus indicating the BGE reference peaks
would be useful correction factors.

With an ideal internal standard, the rate of change would
be equal
for both analyte and ISTD peaks, leading to a slope of zero at all
plug widths when the peak area ratio (PAR) is taken. Due to the varying
slopes, the PARs in these simulations are actually rational functions;
however, they can be approximated as linear lines (Figure 3B) with slopes m of Na/“Cs” = 0.232 and Na/“Li” = 0.212
[ratio/mm]. These slopes are approximately 10% of the analyte’s
(Na); in other words, while not immune to channel variances, the integrated
ISTDs will minimize these influences down to 1/10th that of the analyte
alone. Thus, integrated ISTDs can be used in good approximation to
correct for changes in analyte peak area due to disposable chip differences.

Experiments: Migration Time Reproducibility
Relative
standard deviations (RSDs) were larger between chips than within a
single chip, as expected due to the chip variations mentioned. Chip-to-chip
values were 2.93%, 2.34%, and 3.69% for Na, “Cs”, and
“Li”, respectively. Imprecision in chip-to-chip RSDs
again increased with migration time, indicating (a) variation in separation
path lengths due to varying conductivity electrode alignment and/or
(b) variation in chip-to-chip electroosmotic flow (EOF) due to differences
in chip surface chemistry. Intrachip and chip-to-chip RSDs are provided
in Table S1.

Using the integrated
ISTDs, the reproducibility of the analyte’s migration time
can be equally improved with both references when using a time ratio:
1.06% for Na/“Cs” and 0.98% for Na/“Li”.
When adjusting the migration time of Na using the relative distance
between both ISTDs, using the same equation from previous work,10 the RSD was further improved to 0.71%, as illustrated
in Figure 4. tCs,av and tLi,av are the average arrival times of “Cs” and “Li”
over all measurements (n = 900), respectively. 2

variations in peak arrival time (before) and the resulting correction

are given for the analyte peak and the reference peak time ratios
to compare.

Experiments: Analyte Calibration
Curve Fitting
As seen
previously in Figure 2A, the peak areas of “Cs” and “Li” vary
with Na concentration differences; thus, it is useful to understand
which regression type is theoretically best-suited to fit the BGE-added
reference calibration curves. Electrokinetic injection and separation
steps for multiple NaCl sample concentrations were investigated using
Simul 5. Figure S2 plots the NaCl concentration
in the sample well versus the simulated Na ion concentration in the
injection channel after sufficient time has passed to allow for all
sample ions to cross the stationary boundary. The simulations suggest
that the EKI results in a slightly quadratic curve between 1 and 20
mM, which will then be reflected in the separated analyte peaks. Despite
this quadratic dependence on the Na concentration in the sample well,
the separated peak areas can be approximated with
high confidence using a linear regression between 1 and 10 mM NaCl
(Figure 5A). The separated
peak heights, however, cannot (Figure 5B). Both plots compare the Na analyte peaks
collected from Simul 5 (circles) with the experimental data collected
from all microfluidic chips (error bars). Theoretical calibration
lines have been scaled by a fixed constant to match the arbitrary
values on the y-axis and are otherwise not manipulated;
thus, theoretical curve shapes are in excellent agreement with the
experimental results. The correlation coefficients (R2) for the chip-to-chip Na calibration curve were 0.984
(x) and 0.970 (x2) when
using peak areas and heights, respectively.

(error bars) and simulations (points) of Na peak area vs the NaCl sample concentration, showing excellent
prediction; panel B displays Na peak height. (C)
Six intrachip calibration curves using the Na/“Cs” peak area ratios, illustrating one outlier chip; panel D shows
Na/“Cs” peak height ratios, illustrating
that the outlier chip behaves normally.

When the integrated ISTD is used for correcting the Na peak
height/area,
not only the EKI contributes to the nonlinearity of the calibration
curve, but so does the dependency of the integrated ISTD peak size
on the injected amount of analyte. Then the calibration curve is of
an empirical nature which—similarly to the simple Na peak area—can
be approximated by a second-order polynomial in the concentration
ranges inspected in this study. When the integrated “Li”
peak is used as a reference standard, the correlation coefficients
improve to 0.997 (areas) and 0.988 (heights). Using the integrated
“Cs” reference peak results in calibration curves with
coefficients of 0.979 (areas) and 0.986 (heights). Note that the Na/“Cs”
peak height correlation is comparable to the Na/“Li”
curve; however, the peak area curve is not. When
individual chip Na/“Cs” area calibration
curves are plotted separately, one microfluidic chip is distinctly
different from the others (Figure 5C). This was confirmed by performing the Dixon’s Q test, which identified chip 3-2 as an outlier with a 90%
confidence at every concentration level, except for the lowest (2
mM). If this chip’s data is removed from the experiment set
(n = 5 not 6), the Na/“Cs” area coefficient improves to 0.993—comparable to
“Li”. It is unknown why this single chip shows significantly
different behavior for Na/“Cs” peak areas as compared to other chips, while the Na/“Cs” peak heights (Figure 5D, n = 6) as well as the “Li”
data (not shown) are seemingly unperturbed on the very same chip.

Calibration curve data for both individual and all microchips are
summarized in Table S2.

Experiments:
Peak Area Reproducibility
Chip-to-chip
peak area and height RSDs for each NaCl sample concentration (2, 4,
6, 8, 10 mM) were tested on six randomized chips according to the
OECD requirements on analytical method validations.25 Intrachip RSDs are all between ∼5 and 7% without
using an ISTD for correction. Chip-to-chip variability is ∼1.5–2
times the intrachip variability—much better than in our previous
work,10 where chip-to-chip variability
increased by 3–4 times. Figure S3 compares peak area RSDs at each NaCl concentration,
for each microfluidic chip and all chips.

In the next steps,
RSD values obtained with the integrated ISTD method are compared to
values where either no ISTD or the traditional ISTD method is used.
We notice that a statistical test for comparing RSDs values with a
defined statistical significance is not readily available, and comparing
mere SD values runs up against scaling problems. Nevertheless, the
visual data mining method (Figure 6) enables us to make conclusions convincing enough
for this proof-of-concept study.

Figure 6 RSDs for Na, Na/“Cs”, and
Na/“Li” are
compared for peak areas (A) and heights (B). In panel C, Na peak area and height RSDs for each NaCl concentration
are compared to our previous study (ref (10)) (no integrated ISTDs in the BGE); the values
found in this work are noticeably better, especially at lower concentrations.
Panel D compares Cs as both an integrated and traditional ISTD, illustrating
that the integrated ISTD values are superior. PHR stands for peak
height ratio. RSDs are calculated from six loads per chip, five repeated
measurements per one load (30 data points per chip, for a total of
180 data points at each concentration level).

Peak area and height ratios with both “Cs”
and “Li”
integrated ISTDs improve the chip-to-chip RSDs to ∼3–5%.
When considering peak area ratios (Figure 6A), the “Li”
integrated ISTD gives better RSDs than “Cs” at every
NaCl concentration due to the significantly different Na/“Cs”
values for one chip (as discussed earlier). If only data from the
other five chips are considered, the Na/“Cs” RSD values
are comparable to Na/“Li”. The peak height ratios (Figure 6B)
show good improvement for both “Cs” and “Li”
ISTDs.

As an additional means to judge how well each integrated
ISTD performed,
experimental correlation coefficients (ρ) for the Na peak with
“Cs” and “Li” were calculated with the
same equation from previous work10 3  using the RSD values for the analyte peak
(A), the integrated ISTD peak (ISTD), and their ratio (PAR). This
coefficient is a measure of the integrated ISTD’s correlation
with the analyte, in other words, how well it improves the precision
of the analyte quantification. Correlation coefficients are calculated
for each NaCl concentration and then are averaged to give a final
correlation value for each integrated ISTD (where ρ = 1 is perfect
and ρ = 0 has no correlation).

When the outlier chip is
not used for Na/“Cs” peak
area determination, the average analyte–ISTD correlation is
almost identical for all ratios: 0.831 (heights) and 0.856 (areas)
for Na/“Li”; 0.856 (heights) and 0.853 (areas) for Na/“Cs”.
Including this outlier chip lowers the Na/“Cs” peak
area correlation to 0.729.

Integrated ISTD versus Traditional ISTD
Figure 6C further
compares the Na analyte
peak area and height RSDs for this experiment set with the results
from the traditional ISTD method.10 Note
that the actual areas and heights are depicted without any correction
by an ISTD. At low NaCl concentrations (2–4 mM) a 2-fold increase
in precision is seen in the integrated ISTD data. Also of note is
the comparable RSDs for both Na peak areas and heights in the integrated
ISTD method, with neither being clearly superior. We attribute the
improved (relative to our previous work) chip-to-chip analyte performance
to a reduction in analyte–glass interactions owing to different
chip-to-chip surface chemistries. In the integrated ISTD method, there
are a comparable amount of strong electrolyte ions (Cs and Li) present
everywhere in the system, which may reduce the influence of analyte–wall
interactions leading to increased variability—particularly
at low analyte concentrations.

This improvement can further
be seen in the traditional ISTD Na/Cs PAR, illustrated in Figure 6D. RSDs for 2–4
mM of NaCl are inferior to the values found with the integrated ISTD
method, even though they halved the analyte’s initial variability.
From this figure, we can conclude that the integrated “Cs”
ISTD height ratios perform clearly superior to the
traditional method, as well as the peak area ratios
when the outlier chip is not considered.

Table 1 summarizes
the data collected in this paper with the integrated ISTD method and
compares it to the traditional method. When considering most parameters,
the integrated ISTD values either match or are superior to the traditional
method values. The notable exception is the Cs·Na correlation
coefficient (ρ) which is 0.922 for the traditional ISTD and
∼0.85 for the integrated ISTD method. This indicates that the
degree with which Cs improved the Na precision was better in the traditional
method; however, the final precision is more important than the correlation.
Here, the integrated “Cs” ISTD is equal or better.

Conclusion
We have shown that the integrated ISTD method is a promising means
for improving quantitative precision in disposable microchips, owing
to its matched or superior results when compared to the traditional
ISTD method. In combination with the fact that this method is suitable
for operation by unskilled users, the potential value of the method
strongly increases. Furthermore, indication is given that integrated
ISTDs may be less bound by substance selection than the traditional
method; Cs and Li performed equally well as integrated ISTDs, while
Cs was clearly the better choice in the traditional method. Under
these experimental conditions—also owing to the improved analyte
peak precision alone—the integrated ISTD method is even superior
to the traditional method. Future work will evaluate the integrated
ISTD method for more complex and application relevant sample matrixes.
