Specific digestion
of proteins is an essential step for mass spectrometry-based
proteomics, and the chemical labeling of the resulting peptides is
often used for peptide enrichment or the introduction of desirable
tags. Electrochemical oxidation yielding specific cleavage C-terminal
to tyrosine (Tyr) and tryptophan (Trp) residues provides a potential
alternative to enzymatic digestion and a possibility for further chemical
labeling by introducing reactive spirolactone moieties. However, spirolactone-containing
peptides suffer from low stability due to hydrolysis and intramolecular
side reactions. We found that Cu(II) ions stabilize the spirolactone
and prevent intramolecular side reactions during chemical labeling,
allowing efficient chemical tagging with a reduced excess of labeling
reagent without intramolecular side reactions. On the basis of this
reaction, we developed an analytical procedure combining electrochemical
digestion, Cu(II)-mediated spirolactone biotinylation, and enrichment
by avidin affinity chromatography with mass spectrometry. The method
was optimized with the tripeptide LWL and subsequently applied to
chicken egg white lysozyme, in which one biotinylated electrochemistry
(EC)-cleaved peptide was identified after affinity enrichment. This
proof-of-principle shows that specific enrichment of electrochemically
cleaved spirolactone-containing peptides can be used for protein identification
and notably that inclusion of Cu(II) ions is essential for stabilizing
spirolactones for subsequent biotinylation.

==== Body
Mass spectrometry-based
proteomics
is a powerful and indispensable tool for the analysis of complex samples,1−4 and the specific digestion of proteins plays a key role in their
identification and quantification.4−6 Enzymes with different
specificities are the cornerstone reagents for the digestion of proteins
at specific peptide bonds7−9 while chemical cleavage is sometimes
used as an alternative when a different specificity is required.10−13 Specific cleavage of the peptide bond C-terminal to tyrosine (Tyr)
and tryptophan (Trp) residues occurs after electrochemical oxidation
of peptides and proteins, which makes electrochemistry (EC) a potential
instrumental alternative to chemical and enzymatic peptide bond cleavage.14−20 However, EC oxidation yields complex mixtures due to the generation
of noncleavage oxidation products in addition to cleaved peptides,
which poses a problem for proteomics applications.

Selective
enrichment of proteins and peptides via affinity-based
isolation has increasingly contributed to MS-based proteomics, serving
to reduce sample complexity prior to LC-MS analysis.21−24 An efficient enrichment strategy for the peptides of interest via
specific labeling would significantly reduce sample complexity and
increase the depth of proteomics analyses.21,25,26 Biotinylation is a widely used strategy
to prepare peptides and other molecules for enrichment by avidin affinity
chromatography.25−27 Electrochemical cleavage of the peptide bond of Tyr
or Trp yields a spirolactone moiety at the newly formed C-terminus
providing a handle for specific chemical labeling.17,20 In previous work, we used this unique spirolactone to introduce
affinity tags but encountered problems with spirolactone stability
and intramolecular rearrangement.20

A number of chemical agents and biocatalysts are known to catalyze
reactions between activated esters and primary amines including Lewis
bases (e.g., pyridine, 2-hydroxypyridine),28,29 Lewis acids (e.g., sodium cyanide and salts of zinc, nickel, iron,
lanthanum, and zirconium),30−36 and enzymes (e.g., Candida antarctica lipase B).37−39 For example, La(III) trifluoromethanesulfonate was developed as
catalyst for synthesizing a variety of amides directly from esters
and amines under mild conditions.34 We
therefore investigated a range of potential catalysts in view of their
ability to reduce side reactions and to obtain efficient coupling
with a reduced excess of the often costly labeling reagents. Addition
of Cu(II) ions proved to be highly efficient in preventing spirolactone
hydrolysis as well as intramolecular diketopiperazine formation. On
the basis of this improvement, we developed a specific affinity enrichment
method combining electrochemical digestion, Cu(II)-mediated spirolactone
biotinylation, and affinity chromatography with LC-MS to identify
proteins after electrochemical digestion. The method was first optimized
with the tripeptide LWL and subsequently applied to chicken egg lysozyme.

acetate dihydrate (99.99%), iron(II) perchlorate hydrate (98%), iron(III)
perchlorate hydrate (crystalline), and d-biotin (analytical
standard) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany).
LWL was obtained from Research Plus Inc. (Barnegat, NJ, USA). Amine-PEG2-biotin and monomeric avidin agarose were obtained from Pierce
Biotechnology (Rockford, USA). Acetonitrile (HPLC SupraGradient grade)
was acquired from Biosolve (Valkenswaard, The Netherlands). Ultrapure
water was obtained from a Milli-Q Advantage A10 water purification
system at a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm (Millipore Corporation,
Billerica, MA, USA).

Peptide and Protein Preparation
LWL at a concentration
of 1 mM was prepared in 89/10/1 (v/v/v) water/acetonitrile/formic
acid as stock solution. A stock solution of reduced and alkylated
lysozyme was prepared in 89/10/1 (v/v/v) water/acetonitrile/formic
acid at a protein concentration of 100 μM. For reduction and
alkylation, lysozyme (100 μM) was prepared in 100 mM ammonium
bicarbonate buffer (pH 8). Two mM DTT in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate
buffer was added, and the mixture was incubated with shaking at 500
rpm at 60 °C for 30 min. IAM was added at a concentration of
20 mM after cooling and reacted at room temperature in a dark environment
for 40 min. After alkylation, 8 mM DTT was added to quench the alkylation
reaction for 30 min. Lysozyme precipitated upon reduction and alkylation.
The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 13 000 rpm, and the
supernatant was removed. Water/acetonitrile/formic acid 89/10/1 (v/v/v)
was added to dissolve the precipitated lysozyme and prepare a 100
μM stock solution of reduced and alkylated lysozyme. LWL was
diluted to a final concentration of 10 μM (LWL) and lysozyme
to 5 μM prior to electrochemical cleavage. To prevent formylation
or acid hydrolysis, the formic acid content of lysozyme was increased
to 5% just before the electrochemistry experiments.40−43

Electrochemical Cleavage
Electrochemical oxidation
and cleavage was performed in a μ-PrepCell electrochemical cell
(thin-layer cell, Antec, Zoeterwoude, NL) with a boron-doped diamond
(BDD, 12 × 30 mm × 1 mm) working electrode (Antec), a titanium
counter electrode, and a palladium reference electrode (Pd/H2). A flow rate of 10 μL/min was employed to introduce analyte
solutions via a syringe pump (KD Scientific Inc., Holliston, MA, USA).
The electrochemical potentials were controlled with a ROXY potentiostat
(Antec) operating in Scan and DC mode. Cathodic pretreatment of BDD
electrodes at a negative potential of −3000 mV was used to
regenerate the electrode surface prior to all experiments by pumping
0.5 M nitric acid in water at a flow rate of 50 μL/min for 1
h. Prior to use, the cell was flushed with electrolyte solution at
a potential of −2000 mV for 1 h.

The optimal cleavage
potentials of peptides and proteins were first determined via online
EC-MS experiments by ramping the cell potential from 0 to 3000 mV
linearly at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. The detection of electrochemical
cleavage products in online EC-MS was achieved in an API 365 triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer (PE-Sciex, Concord, Ontario, Canada)
with an EP10+ upgrade (Ionics, Bolton, Ontario, Canada) in positive
ion mode. LWL and lysozyme were oxidized at 1000 and 2000 mV vs Pd/H2, and the product mixtures (EC-LWL and EC-lysozyme) were collected
for LC-MS analysis and further reactions.

Effect of Cu(II) on Stability
of Cleavage Products and Chemical
Tagging
Cu(II) chloride dehydrate at a concentration of 100
μM was prepared in 89/10/1 (v/v/v) water/acetonitrile/formic
acid as stock solution. EC-LWL with Cu(II) was prepared by adding
4 μL of Cu(II) chloride dehydrate (100 μM) into 2 mL of
solution and dried following the same procedure as described in our
previous work.20 EC-LWL without Cu(II)
was dried following the same procedure as the control.

To study
the effect of Cu(II) on the stability of the spirolactone in peptides,
2 mL of EC-LWL with or without Cu(II) was concentrated by evaporation
under nitrogen (2 h) and dried in an Eppendorf Concentrator at 30
°C. EC-LWL was prepared at a concentration of 400 μM by
dissolving the dried sample in 50 μL of DMSO/TEA (99.9/0.1)
by pipetting for 30 s. Reactions were performed at 25 °C with
shaking at 900 rpm in an Eppendorf Thermomixer. Ten μL of reaction
product mixtures at time point 0 and 6 h was prepared at a concentration
of 5 μM by dilution with 390 μL of 99/1 (v/v) water/formic
acid, and 40 μL of EC-LWL was subjected to LC-MS analysis. LC-MS
analyses were performed on an Ultimate plus system (Dionex-LC Packings,
Amsterdam, The Netherlands) coupled to an API 365 triple quadrupole
mass spectrometer (PE-Sciex) with an EP10+ upgrade (Ionics). The separation
of the reaction mixtures was achieved on a Vydac RP-C18 column (150
mm × 2.1 mm i.d., 5 μm particles, 300 Å pore size,
Grace Vydac, Lokeren, Belgium) with a 35 min gradient of 2–50%
acetonitrile in water/0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 250 μL/min.

Chemical tagging with hexylamine was performed at a concentration
of 500 μM by adding 20 μL of a mixture of DMSO, TEA, and
hexylamine (99.65:0.1:0.25) to 1 mL of a dried EC-LWL mixture in the
presence or absence of Cu(II), respectively, with a 50-fold molar
excess of hexylamine. The reaction mixtures were incubated with shaking
at 900 rpm at 25 °C for 6 h and analyzed by LC-MS. Biotinylation
of EC-LWL was performed at a concentration of 500 μM for peptides
in the presence or absence of Cu(II). Prior to use, 2 mg of amine-PEG2-biotin was prepared in 1 mL of water and purified on an Oasis
HLB extraction cartridge (1 cm3, 30 mg, Waters Corporation,
Milford, Massachusetts, USA) by elution with 15 mL of 10% ACN. After
evaporating under nitrogen and drying in an Eppendorf Concentrator
5301 (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), amine-PEG2-biotin was
dissolved in 50 μL of DMSO/TEA (99.9/0.1). Twenty μL of
amine-PEG2-biotin in solution was added to the sample in
the presence or absence of Cu(II) and shaken at 900 rpm at 25 °C
for 16 h, with a 200-fold molar excess of amine-PEG2-biotin.
Biotinylated EC-LWL (Bio-EC-LWL) was diluted to 5 μM by adding
99/1 (v/v) water/formic acid, and 40 μL of the reaction mixtures
was analyzed by LC-MS. Liquid chromatography was performed on a Waters
UPLC I-class system (Waters Corporation, Milford, USA) with a Waters
Acquity Peptide BEH C18 column (100 mm × 2.1 mm i.d., 1.7 μm
particles, 300 Å pore size, Waters Corporation, Milford, USA)
at 400 μL/min using a linear gradient from 5% to 40% acetonitrile
in water/0.1% formic acid in 25 min. For mass spectrometry, a Maxis
plus quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (QTOF, Bruker, Bremen,
Germany) in positive electrospray ionization mode was used.

Biotinylation
of EC-Lysozyme with Amine-PEG2-Biotin
For biotinylation
of EC-lysozyme with amine-PEG2-biotin,
a reaction was performed in the presence of Cu(II). EC-lysozyme with
Cu(II) was prepared by adding 4 μL of Cu(II) chloride dehydrate
(100 μM) into 2 mL of EC-lysozyme (5 μM) and dried following
the same procedure as described in our previous work.20 Two mg of amine-PEG2-biotin was purified, dried,
and dissolved in 50 μL of DMSO/TEA (99.9/0.1) as described above.
Twenty μL of amine-PEG2-biotin in DMSO/TEA (99.9/0.1)
was added to the dried EC-lysozyme followed by pipetting for 30 s,
and the mixture was incubated for 16 h with shaking at 900 rpm at
25 °C.

Removal of Excess Biotin by SPE after Biotinylation
The biotinylation reaction mixture was diluted with 1 mL of water/formic
acid (99.9/0.1) and loaded on a Strata C18-E cartridge (55 μm,
70 Å, Phenomenex, Utrecht, The Netherlands). Twenty mL of 10%
ACN and 3 mL of 15% ACN in H2O/FA (99.9/0.1) were used
to remove the excess of amine-PEG2-biotin (200-fold) followed
by elution of the biotinylated peptide by adding 3 mL of 50% ACN to
the cartridge. Elution fractions were collected and concentrated by
evaporation under nitrogen (2 h, 15 μL) at 30 °C. Bio-EC-LWL
and bio-EC-lysozyme were diluted with 100 mM phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS, 100 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 7) to a
final volume of 500 μL prior to affinity enrichment.

Affinity
Enrichment of Biotinylated Peptides
One mL
of monomeric avidin agarose was packed and prepared in a disposable
column according to the supplier’s instructions. The biotinylated
electrochemically cleaved peptides were captured with 1 mL of monomeric
avidin agarose in the column by incubation for 30 min at room temperature.
The immobilized monomeric avidin agarose column was washed with 2
mL of PBS. Biotinylated peptides were eluted with 2 mL of d-biotin at a concentration of 2 mM in 100 mM PBS and concentrated
by evaporation using nitrogen at 30 °C for 2 h. The elution fractions
of bio-EC-LWL and bio-EC-lysozyme were prepared to a final volume
of 5 and 2 mL, respectively, by adding 99/1 (v/v) water/formic acid
prior to LC-MS/MS analysis.

Analysis by LC-MS/MS
LC-MS/MS analyses
of the EC-cleaved
peptide mixture, the biotinylation reaction mixture, and the affinity-enriched
biotinylated peptides were performed on a UPLC I-Class system (Waters)
coupled to a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Maxis plus,
Bruker) as described above. MS scans from m/z 200 to 1000 were recorded in profile mode using positive
polarity.

The LC-MS/MS analyses of complex peptide mixtures
obtained after avidin purification of EC-lysozyme were performed on
a Dionex Ultimate 3000 nano-LC system equipped with an Acclaim Pepmap
column (75 μm i.d. × 150 mm, Thermo Scientific, Bremen,
Germany) coupled to a Q-Exactive Plus quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer
(Thermo Scientific). To separate peptides, a linear gradient of 2–60%
acetonitrile in water/0.1% formic acid in 50 min at a flow rate of
300 nL/min was employed. MS scans from m/z 200 to 1750 were recorded at a resolution of 75 000.
MS/MS spectra were recorded at a resolution of 17 500 with
a normalized collision energy of 35 V in data-dependent mode. The
top 10 highest intensity peaks were chosen for MS/MS.

Data Analysis
and Database Searching
The database search
engine PEAKS (version 8.0, Bioinformatics Solutions Inc.) was used
to analyze LC-MS/MS data using the chicken UniProt protein sequence
database (Gallus gallus, updated 06–12–2016,
SwissProt reviewed entries only) containing 2601 proteins. The search

Results and Discussion
Stabilization of Peptide-Spirolactones
against Intramolecular
Rearrangement in the Presence of Cu(II) Ions
Specific cleavage
after Tyr and Trp in peptides and proteins upon electrochemical oxidation
yields a complex mixture of peptides with a reactive spirolactone
moiety at the C-terminus of the N-terminal fragment in addition to
other peptide and protein modifications.18−20 We previously
developed an approach to label electrochemically cleaved peptides
via spirolactone chemistry to introduce affinity tags20 for subsequent enrichment by immobilized avidin chromatography
and characterization by mass spectrometry. In this approach, acetylation
of the amino group at the N-terminus was essential to prevent intramolecular
rearrangement to nonreactive diketopiperazines. However, this approach
has limitations when it comes to the electrochemical cleavage of larger
peptides or proteins, because of the unavoidable generation of neo-N-termini
and the increasing difficulty to achieve complete acetylation of all
amino groups. Another limitation of this approach is that a large
molar excess (2000-fold) of the affinity tag amine-PEG2-biotin20 was required for efficient tagging.
To prevent this unwanted side reaction and to increase coupling efficiency
at lower molar excess of affinity tags, an alternative strategy is
required that does not rely on acetylation.

To investigate a
range of catalysts that have been described to facilitate the reaction
between an activated ester and a primary amine, we screened the nucleophilic
catalysts pyridine, 2-hydroxypyridine and NaCN, as well as the following
transition metal ions: Ni(II), Cu(I), Cu(II), Zn(II), Fe(II), and
Fe(III).28−31 To study the effect of the selected catalysts, we followed the stability
of LW+14 in DMSO containing 0.1% TEA as well as the reaction of LW+14
with a 50-fold molar excess of hexylamine. The presence of 0.5% pyridine
or 2-hydroxypyridine in the reaction mixture had no effect on the
chemical coupling yield and accelerated the undesirable intramolecular
rearrangement (data not shown). NaCN and most of the transition metal
ions had no effect on either coupling yield or the stability of the
spirolactone-containing peptides with respect to intramolecular rearrangement.
Out of all tested reagents, we found that only addition of 2 μM
Cu(II) ions prevented the intramolecular rearrangement reaction and
significantly increased coupling yields with hexylamine. Figure 1A shows that the
spirolactone-containing peptide LW+14 rearranges to a pair of isomeric
diketopiperazines (LW+14*) in the absence of Cu(II), as previously
described,20 while this was prevented by
the addition of Cu(II). Rearrangement of LW+14 proceeded to 75% completion
within 6 h in the absence of Cu(II), while LW+14 was stable in the
presence of Cu(II) even under basic conditions in DMSO containing
0.1% TEA (Figure 1B).
The small amount of diketopiperazines observed in the chromatogram
was formed during the electrochemical cleavage reaction prior to adding
Cu(II) ions.

in the
absence of Cu(II) (A) and in the presence of Cu(II) (B) after incubation
for 6 h in DMSO/TEA (99.9/0.1) at room temperature. For clarity, the
6 h traces in both (A) and (B) were offset by 1 min on the x-axis and by 5 × 105 cps on the y-axis.

Cu(II)-Mediated Spirolactone
Chemical Tagging
As shown
above, Cu(II) stabilized the spirolactone-containing peptide and prevented
rearrangement to diketopiperazines without having to resort to acetylation.
Consequently, the chemical coupling of LW+14 to hexylamine was studied
in the absence and in the presence of Cu(II) in DMSO containing 0.1%
TEA. Efficient chemical tagging was only observed in the presence
of Cu(II) at a 50-fold molar excess of hexylamine (Figure 2).

LW+14 with a 50-fold molar excess of hexylamine

Extracted ion chromatograms of the electrochemically cleaved tripeptide
LWL (LW+14, m/z 332.150) (A) before
reaction, and of the chemical labeling product LW-hexylamine (433.256)
(B) after reaction in DMSO containing 0.1% TEA for 6 h at room temperature
in the absence of Cu(II). In the same order, panels C and D show extracted
ion chromatograms of LW+14 (C) and the chemical labeling products
LW-hexylamine (D) after reaction under the same conditions in the
presence of Cu(II). Peaks marked with ∗ depict the ion of LWL
containing one 13C atom, which has the same mass as LW-hexylamine.

Reaction of LW+14 with amine-PEG2-biotin at a 200-fold
molar excess was investigated next. Figure 3A,B shows that only trace amounts of biotinylated
LW+14 (Biotin-LW) were observed in the absence of Cu(II) ions since
LW+14 underwent intramolecular rearrangement as the main reaction.
Addition of Cu(II) prevented this side reaction resulting in complete
biotinylation of LW+14 with amine-PEG2-biotin under otherwise
identical conditions (Figure 3C,D). These results confirmed that addition of Cu(II) is critical
for efficient chemical tagging of spirolactone-containing peptides.

products (diketopiperazines) as described previously.20

Affinity Enrichment of
Biotinylated Peptides
Since
electrochemical peptide bond cleavage not only generates the spirolactone-containing
peptides, we investigated whether Cu(II)-mediated biotinylation can
be used to enrich cleavage products from more complex mixtures. To
this end, we combined Cu(II)-mediated biotinylation with selective
affinity enrichment on monomeric avidin beads as shown in Figure 4A. Figure 4B shows the conversion of a
Trp-containing peptide from electrochemical cleavage to biotinylation
of the C-terminus of the N-terminal fragment.

electrochemically generated peptide fragments
after electrochemical cleavage of peptides and proteins via Cu(II)-mediated
biotinylation of the spirolactone-containing peptide fragments and
selective affinity enrichment. (B) Scheme showing the chemical conversion
of a Trp-containing peptide from electrochemical cleavage to a biotinylated
residue using amine-PEG2-biotin. R1 and R2 represent the peptide chains N-terminal and C-terminal to
the Trp residue, respectively. The dashed line indicates the main
MS/MS fragmentation site producing the characteristic fragment ion
at m/z = 375.21 (see Figure 5).

We first tested this approach on the tripeptide LWL. LWL
was electrochemically
cleaved at 1100 mV in an electrochemical cell with a BDD working electrode,
yielding a mixture containing LWL, uncleaved oxidation products (LWL+32),
and the spirolactone-containing cleavage product LW+14 (Figure 5A). LW+14 was completely biotinylated to LW-amine-PEG2-biotin (Biotin-LW) in DMSO containing 0.1% TEA in the presence
of Cu(II) resulting in a mass increment of 374.21 Da (Figure 5B). Excess amine-PEG2-biotin was removed by SPE on a C18 cartridge, and the biotinylated
peptide was captured on monomeric avidin agarose (Figure S1). After washing, biotinylated peptides were eluted
with 2 mL of d-biotin (2 mM) in PBS. Figure 5C shows that biotinylated LW+14 (Biotin-LW)
was effectively enriched from the complex mixture.

Affinity Enrichment of
Biotinylated Spirolactone-Containing
Peptides from EC-Cleaved Lysozyme
To study whether Cu(II)-mediated
biotinylation after electrochemical peptide bond cleavage can be used
to enrich spirolactone-containing peptides from proteins, we applied
the procedure to lysozyme (chicken egg), a protein of 14.6 kDa. Lysozyme
was electrochemically cleaved at 2000 mV, and the complex peptide
mixture was biotinylated, enriched, and subjected to nanoLC-MS/MS.
Data were subjected to searching the chicken UniProt protein sequence
database (Gallus gallus, updated 06–12–2016,
SwissProt reviewed entries only) containing 2601 proteins. Modifications
such as biotinylation (mass increment of 374.2062 Da) at the C-termini
of predicted Tyr and Trp cleavage sites (resulting in an EC-Y+372.16
and an EC-W+388.18) were taken into account. The biotinylated peptide 54GILQINSRW62+388.18, which derives from the
spirolactone-containing peptide 54GILQINSRW62+14, was identified as a unique sequence of lysozyme. The MS/MS spectrum
of the doubly charged precursor ion (m/z at 737.8960) shows the characteristic, abundant fragment ion of
the coupled biotin tag at m/z 375.2062
together with Fragments 1 to 4, which are smaller fragments of the
amine-PEG2-biotin tag providing a signature of a biotin-tagged
compound (Figure 6).
This result provides proof-of-principle that it is possible to identify
a protein by combining electrochemical peptide bond cleavage followed
by Cu(II)-mediated biotinylation and selective affinity enrichment
on monomeric avidin agarose. This approach will be further optimized
and evaluated on more complex protein mixtures in view of future proteomics
applications.

after Cu(II)-mediated biotinylation. The fragment at m/z 375.2062 comprises the entire amine-PEG2-biotin tag, whereas Fragments 1 to 4 are parts thereof (see the
proposed structures and m/z values
of the fragments in Figure S2). The y and
b fragment ions match the amino acid sequence.

Conclusions
Electrochemical cleavage of peptide bonds
C-terminal to Trp and
Tyr opens the possibility for chemical labeling and enrichment via
reactive spirolactone moieties at the C-terminus of the N-terminal
cleavage products. However, side reactions such as hydrolysis and
intramolecular rearrangement during sample handling and chemical labeling
proved to be challenges that needed to be overcome before this approach
could be considered a potential instrumental alternative to chemical
and enzymatic peptide bond cleavage in MS-based proteomics. In this
work, we show that addition of Cu(II) ions stabilizes the spirolactone
moiety toward intramolecular rearrangement to diketopiperazines and
with respect to hydrolysis. This allowed efficient chemical tagging
of spirolactones in the presence of free N-terminal amino groups.
On the basis of this finding, we developed a method combining electrochemical
peptide bond cleavage, Cu(II)-mediated spirolactone biotinylation,
and affinity chromatography with LC-MS/MS. This approach was optimized
with the tripeptide LWL and applied to lysozyme from chicken egg.
We identified a unique biotinylated peptide (54GILQINSRW62+388.18) in an unbiased “proteomics-like” approach
using the algorithm PEAKS to search the sequence database of chicken
(Gallus gallus). Despite this proof-of-principle
study, there is need for further improvements, since we observed that
spirolactones may already hydrolyze or rearrange during electrochemical
cleavage and further sample handling, especially when positioned C-terminal
to Tyr. We will investigate in future experiments whether Cu(II) ions
can be added prior to electrochemical cleavage to prevent these side
reactions. This refinement of the method should increase the recovery
of electrochemically cleaved peptides significantly and facilitate
subsequent biotinylation. In summary, we describe an approach for
enriching electrochemically cleaved peptides from a mixture of electrochemical
cleavage products that may serve as starting material for LC-MS/MS-based
protein identification.
