Ultrasensitive
and quantitative detection of cancer biomarkers
is an unmet challenge because of their ultralow concentrations in
clinical samples. Although gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-based immunoassays
offer high sensitivity, they were unable to quantitatively detect
targets of interest most likely due to their very narrow linear ranges.
This article describes a quantitative colorimetric immunoassay based
on glucose oxidase (GOx)-catalyzed growth of 5 nm AuNPs that can detect
cancer biomarkers from attomolar to picomolar levels. In addition,
the limit of detection (LOD) of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of
this approach (93 aM) exceeds that of commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) (6.3 pM) by more than 4 orders of magnitude. The emergence
of red or purple color based on enzyme-catalyzed growth of 5 nm AuNPs
in the presence of target antigen is particularly suitable for point-of-care
(POC) diagnostics in both resource-rich and resource-limited settings.

Ultrasensitive
quantification
of cancer biomarkers in complex samples is of great significance to
clinical decision-making, and thus facilitates enabling early-stage
diagnosis, monitoring cancer progression, and evaluating therapeutic
interventions. Currently available quantitative immunoassays, such
as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the most popular format
in clinical biomarker detection, typically measure protein biomarkers
at concentrations above 0.1 ng/mL.1 This
detection sensitivity is unable to reach the clinical threshold of
many protein biomarkers especially in the early stages of the diseases
when their concentrations in clinical samples are generally in the
range of fg/mL to pg/mL.2−5 It is therefore extremely important to develop quantitative
immunoassays with ultrahigh sensitivity.

The past decades have
witnessed a variety of enhanced immunoassays
with ultrahigh sensitivity (Table S1, Supporting
Information). Among these strategies, gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-based
colorimetric assays have been incorporated with immunoreactions for
biomarker detection, which have drawn considerable attention owing
to their unprecedented sensitivity and convenient readout.6−11 Presently, AuNP-based colorimetric assays mainly depend on the monodisperse
or aggregated process of AuNPs, where detection target-induced molecular
events are transformed into the respective red-to-blue (or purple)
color change.12−16 These clear red-to-blue (or purple) results can be easily distinguished
by the naked eye, making it suitable for point-of-care (POC) diagnostics.
Although the reported AuNP-based immunoassays provide sufficiently
high sensitivity, most of them are unable to quantify the detection
targets of interest due to their narrow linear detection ranges.6−16 It still remains a great challenge to create ultrasensitive and
quantitative immunoassays.

Herein, we report a quantitative
immunoassay that allows detection
of attomolar cancer protein biomarkers in clinical samples. This approach
is dependent on the growth of small sized AuNPs (5 nm in diameter)
in the presence of H2O2 and AuCl4–. We noted that the extinction coefficient of
5 nm AuNPs is much lower than those of larger sized AuNPs (Table S2, Supporting Information), indicating that the
diluted 5 nm AuNP solution at relatively low concentration (normally
<10 nM) is colorless, while solutions containing larger sized AuNPs
at the same concentration are typically red (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Therefore, we anticipated
that upon the growth of 5 nm AuNPs, the colorless AuNP solution can
turn red. In this study, we employed glucose oxidase (GOx) to generate
H2O2.17,18 To apply this phenomenon
into immunoassay, GOx is conjugated with detection antibody (Ab2)
on the surfaces of magnetic beads (MBs). The amount of GOx is proportional
to the concentration of detection targets sandwiched through immunoreaction.
When the immunoassay is performed on the polystyrene (PS) substrate
in a 96-well plate, the captured target pulls down the Ab2–GOx–MBs
conjugates on the substrate, where the GOx catalyzes the oxidation
of glucose to produce H2O2. The obtained H2O2 induces the growth of 5 nm sized AuNPs in the
presence of AuCl4– (Scheme 1). As a consequence, the colorless AuNP solutions turns red
along with an appearance of an absorption band at around 530 nm in
the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, which in turn
is used to quantify the detection targets. Unlike previous AuNP-based
assays that depend on the red-to-blue (or purple) color change,6−11 the assay we report here is based on a colorless-to-red process.
The way that the signal is generated is similar to that of horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-based ELISA (from colorless to yellow), endowing
our assay great promise for quantitative detection.

Scheme 1 Schematic Diagram
of the Quantitative Immunoassay Based on Glucose
Oxidase (GOx)-Catalyzed Growth of Gold Nanoparticles (AuNPs, 5 nm
in Diameter)
Prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) is first immobilized by the capture antibody (Ab1) and then
recognized by the detection antibody (Ab2) conjugated with GOx on
the surfaces of magnetic beads (MBs). The immobilized GOx catalyzes
the oxidation of β-d-glucose to generate H2O2, which induces the growth of the 5 nm AuNPs in the
presence of AuCl4–. With the enlargement
of AuNPs, the solution turns red from colorless.

Experimental
Section

83 nM) with a diameter of 5 nm were purchased from TED PELLA, Inc.

peroxide (H2O2), bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein
assay kit, and N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated magnetic
beads (NHS-MBs) with a diameter of around 1 μm were purchased
from Fisher Scientific. H2O2 Assay Kit (ab102500)
was purchased from Abcam. DBCO–PEG4–NHS ester (NHS-DBCO)
and Azido–PEG4–NHS ester (NHS-azide) were purchase from
Click Chemistry Tools. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 10×, pH
7.4) was purchased from Mediatech, Inc., and was diluted 10-fold when
used. The 96-well polystyrene plate was purchased from R&D Systems.
Monoclonal primary antihuman PSA antibody (PSA-Ab1, clone no. CHYH1)
and secondary antihuman PSA antibody (PSA-Ab2, clone no. CHYH2) were
purchased from Anogen/Yes Biotech Laboratory, Ltd. The serum samples
were obtained from Capital Biosciences, and participants have given
written informed consent for scientific research. PSA (human) ELISA
kit was purchased from Abnova Corporation. Deionized water (Milli-Q
grade, Millipore) with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ·cm was
used throughout this study. The UV–vis spectra of AuNP solutions
were recorded with a Genesys 10s UV–vis spectrophotometer.
The absorbance of AuNP solutions in 96-well plates were collected
at 530 nm by a Synergy 2 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments,
Inc.). TEM images were obtained by using a JEOL 1400 model at an accelerating
voltage of 100 kV. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was performed on
a Zeta Sizer Nano ZS (Malvern Zetasizer 3000HS and He/Ne laser at
632.8 nm at scattering angles of 90 at 25 °C).

Identification
of the AuNP-Based Assay
H2O2 was first
diluted with deionized water to result in
various concentrations ranging from 10 μM to 1 mM. To the resulted
H2O2 solutions was then added 0.6 mM HAuCl4. Finally, 8.3 nM AuNP seeds (5 nm in diameter) were added
into each solution. The mixtures were incubated at ambient temperature
for 20 min. The photograph was taken, and the corresponding UV–vis
absorption was collected by a Genesys 10s UV–vis spectrophotometer.

Preparation of Ab2–GOx–MBs
To obtain
Ab2–GOx–MBs, we first prepared dibenzocyclooctyl (DBCO)-conjugated
Ab2. Briefly, Ab2 was dissolved in 200 μL of PBS (pH 7.4) at
a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. Then, NHS-activated DBCO (10 mM, 6.5
μL) was mixed with the Ab2 solution at a 50:1 mol ratio and
incubated at ambient temperature for 30 min. The reaction was stopped
by quenching buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8), and the quenching reaction
was allowed to proceed at ambient temperature for 5 min. The resulting
products were purified using a centrifugal filter device (Amicon Ultra-0.5,
Millipore) with a 30K Nominal Molecular Weight Limit (NMWL). The purified
antibodies were measured by UV–vis absorption. As shown in
Figure S2, Supporting Information, a new
absorption peak at around 309 nm was observed, which was attributed
to the DBCO moieties on Ab2. The number of DBCO per Ab2 can be determined
from the absorbance scan of the purified product. On the basis of
the Beer–Lambert law, 1  where A309DBCO
is the absorbance of DBCO-Ab2 at 309 nm; ε309DBCO
and ε280Ab2 represent the extinction coefficients
of DBCO (12 000 M–1 cm–1) and Ab2 (204 000 M–1 cm–1), respectively; A280CAb2 is the corrected absorbance
of DBCO-Ab2 at 280 nm, which can be calculated by the equation A280CAb2 = A280Ab2
– (A309DBCO × CFDBCO), where A280Ab2 is the absorbance of
DBCO-Ab2 at 280 nm; and CFDBCO is the correction factor
at 280 nm (1.089). On the basis of eq 1 and
Figure S2, Supporting Information, the
average number of DBCO per Ab2 was calculated to be 21.

After
obtaining DBCO-Ab2, we then prepared GOx-MBs. As started, 200 μL
of NHS-activated MBs (1 mg/mL) were placed into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge
tube, and the supernatant was removed by a magnetic stand. Then, ice-cold
HCl solution (1 mM) was added to wash the beads. The activated beads
were mixed with 100 μL of GOx (3 mg/mL) in PBS by votexing for
30 s. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature on a rotator.
During the first 30 min of the incubation, the tube was vortexed for
15 s every 5 min. For the remaining time, the tube was vortexed for
15 s every 15 min until the reaction was complete. Once GOx-loaded
MBs were obtained, the number of GOx per MB was measured to be around
76 000 by the BCA protein assay kit.

To conjugate with
DBCO-Ab2, the GOx-MBs were first modified with
azide groups by adding 2 μL of NHS-activated azide (1 mM) into
the obtained GOx-MB solution. The resulting solution was incubated
at ambient temperature for 30 min and purified by a magnetic stand.
The resulting azide-modified GOx-MBs (200 μL, 1 mg/mL) were
mixed with the as-prepared DBCO-Ab2 (2 μL, 1 mg/mL). The mixture
was allowed to incubate at ambient temperature for 2 h. The resulting
Ab2–GOx–MBs were collected and purified by a magnetic
stand for further use.

Detection of Ab2–GOx–MBs by
the AuNP-Based Assay
To demonstrate that Ab2–GOx–MBs
can catalyze the
oxidation of glucose to generate H2O2, we applied
our colorless-to-red assay to monitor the generated H2O2, which in turn was used to measure the amount of Ab2–GOx–MBs.
Ab2–GOx–MBs with various concentrations ranging from
105 to 109 particles/mL were incubated with
glucose (5 mM) in pH 5.0 citrate–Na2HPO4 buffered solutions. The resulting solutions were then incubated
at 35 °C for 10 min. The obtained solutions were added to the
mixture of 5 nm AuNP seeds (8.3 nM) and AuCl4– (0.6 mM). The mixtures were then incubated at ambient temperature
for 20 min. The absorbance at 530 nm was recorded by a Synergy 2 Multi-Mode
Microplate Reader.

Procedure of AuNP-Based Immunoassay for PSA
The immunoassay
detection was performed in 96-well polystyrene (PS) plates. First,
Ab1 (4 μg/mL) in bicarbonate buffer (100 mM, pH 9.6) was added
into the wells in the PS plate and incubated at 4 °C overnight.
After rinsing with PBS for 3 runs, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in
PBS was added into each well as a blocking agent. Then, PSA-spiked
PBS and 100% fetal bovine serum solutions were added, respectively,
at concentrations ranging from 10 to 105 fg/mL, and the
PBS-only and serum-only solutions were set as controls. The plate
was kept at 37 °C for 1 h and washed with PBS for 3 runs. Later,
100 μL of Ab2–GOx–MB (0.1 mg/mL) solutions were
added into each well, and incubated for 30 min. Two hundred microliters
of PBST was added into each well and rinsed for 3 runs. Glucose (5
mM) in pH 5.0 citrate–Na2HPO4 buffered
solutions was added into each well and incubated at 35 °C for
10 min. To each well was added the mixture of 5 nm AuNP seeds (8.3
nM) and AuCl4– (0.6 mM). The mixtures
were incubated at ambient temperature for 20 min. In the end, photographs
were taken and their corresponding absorbance at 530 nm was recorded
by a Synergy 2 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader.

HRP-Based ELISA for PSA
In terms of HRP-based ELISA
for PSA, we applied the commercial PSA assay kit to measure the levels
of PSA in both spiked samples and clinical samples. We performed the
detection procedures strictly by following the recommended steps as
received.

Results and Discussion
As a starting
point, we attempted to demonstrate the concept and
investigate the impact of H2O2 on the growth
of AuNPs. Different concentrations of H2O2 were
added to a solution containing 5 nm AuNP seeds (8.3 nM, stabilized
by citrate) and AuCl4– (0.6 mM). The
resulting solutions were allowed to incubate at room temperature for
20 min (see the dynamic process in Figure 1). The results in Figure 2a show that, as
the concentration of H2O2 increases, the solutions
gradually turn red. The color intensity is highly associated with
the concentration of H2O2. The obtained red
solutions can be monitored by UV–vis spectroscopy. As depicted
in Figure 2b, the absorbance at around 530
nm is intensified with an increased amount of H2O2. By collecting the absorbance at 530 nm for each solution, we found
the intensity of the red color is in a linear range between 10 and
100 μM (Figure 2c), suggesting the feasibility
of this probe to quantify the target of interest.

each sample were recorded every 1 min by a Synergy 2 Multi-Mode Microplate
Reader. Error bar: standard deviation of three independent measurements.

and those after adding (e) 10, (f) 100, and (g) 1000 μM of H2O2, respectively. Scale bar, 50 nm.

A further insight into the mechanism of the red
color emergence
can be obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Figure 2d shows the TEM image of the 5 nm AuNP seeds. Figure 2e–g shows the obtained AuNPs after treatment
of the seeds with 10, 100, and 1000 μM of H2O2, respectively. For the sample treated by 10 μM of H2O2, most AuNPs were 5 nm AuNP seeds accompanied
by a few larger sized spherical AuNPs (28.4 ± 4.6 nm in diameter).
When the concentration of H2O2 was increased
to 100 μM, some AuNP clusters were found, causing the enlargement
of AuNPs with a wide size distribution (29.5 ± 16.8 nm). The
color of the solutions became purple most likely due to the formation
of larger sized AuNPs, which was confirmed by the red shift (ca. 13
nm) of the maximum absorbance in the UV–vis spectra (Figure 2b). It has been reported that the clusters are catalytically
grown at the sharp intersections of the faces of the parent AuNP seeds.19,20 Interestingly, when the concentration of H2O2 reached 1000 μM, the clusters disappeared. Instead, the AuNPs
became spherical with relatively narrow size distribution (24.5 ±
12.2 nm). As a consequence, the color of the solutions turned red,
and a blue shift in the absorbance maxima was observed (Figure 2b). The morphological change of the obtained AuNPs
can be explained by the fact that Au deposit tends to smooth out the
sharp edges of the particles to decrease their surface energy.21 The size change of the obtained AuNPs was also
supported by the dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis (Figure S3, Supporting Information). It is worth pointing
out that other reducing agents such as ascorbic acid and NADH may
have the same function as H2O2, i.e., reacting
with AuCl4– in the presence of AuNP seeds
and thus causing the enlargement of AuNPs. By incubating various concentrations
of ascorbic acid and NADH separately with the mixture of 5 nm AuNP
seeds (8.3 nM) and AuCl4– (0.6 mM), we
observed that the color of the solutions turned red rapidly and that
more reducing agents induced more red color. The color change was
reflected by the absorbance at around 530 nm (Figure S4, Supporting Information).

After demonstrating
that H2O2 can enlarge
5 nm AuNPs and the growth process can be seen by the naked eye, we
attempted to bring this approach into immunoassays. We first prepared
the Ab2 and GOx comodified magnetic beads (Ab2–GOx–MBs)
through a step-by-step procedure. MB has been reported as an excellent
carrier that can load many thousands of enzyme molecules for signal
amplification while maintaining the activity.22−25 In this study, we chose N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-activated MB (1 μm in diameter)
to load GOx (approximately 76 000 GOX per MB), and
the resulting GOx-coated beads were conjugated with Ab2 via a copper-free
click chemistry (details were shown in Supporting
Information).26 Upon obtaining Ab2–GOx–MBs,
we applied the as-prepared AuNP-based probe to test their GOx-like
activity, i.e., catalyzing the oxidation of glucose to generate H2O2. Ab2–GOx–MBs with various concentrations
were first mixed with glucose (5 mM) to produce various amounts of
H2O2. The resulting solutions were added to
the mixture of 5 nm AuNP seeds (8.3 nM) and AuCl4– (0.6 mM). Under the optimized reaction conditions (Figures S5 and
S6, Supporting Information), we observed
that the solutions turned red gradually, and the color intensity is
highly related to the concentration of Ab2–GOx–MBs,
which was further confirmed by the absorbance at 530 nm (Figure S7, Supporting Information). On the basis of a signal-to-noise
ratio of 3, the limit of detection (LOD) of the colorless-to-red probe
for Ab2–GOx–MBs was determined to be 3.4 × 104 particles/mL with a wide linear range from 105 to 109 particles/mL.

This strategy was subsequently
adapted into the sandwich ELISA
for PSA detecion, which is a classical prostate cancer biomarker approved
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We started the detection
by diluting various concentrations of PSA with PBS to result in final
concentrations ranging from 10 to 105 fg/mL. To test the
possible interference from the unknown matrices in real samples, PSA
was also spiked into fetal bovine sera at the same concentrations
as another group. For both groups of PSA-spiked samples, the colorless
solutions became purple, whose intensity is highly dependent on the
concentration of PSA. Higher concentrations of PSA enabled more purple
color (Figure 3a). In comparison, the samples
remained colorless if no PSA was added. More importantly, the tendency
in color emergence of the two groups of samples is almost the same,
indicating that the unrelated components in clinical samples may have
negligible effects on this immunoassay. Therefore, the emergence of
purple color is due to the biospecific interactions between PSA and
its antibodies rather than the nonspecific adsorption of Ab2–GOx–MB
on the PS substrate. The lowest detectable concentration of PSA where
the purple color can be clearly discriminated by the naked eye was
10 fg/mL (300 aM). Note that the color of the solution is purple rather
than red. This phenomenon is most likely due to the fact that the
amount of the generated H2O2 is not sufficient
to catalyze the formation of uniform spherical AuNPs. To test this
hypothesis, we measured the concentration of the generated H2O2 in each well. As shown in Figure S8, Supporting Information, the amount of the generated H2O2 is highly correlated with the PSA concentration.
More PSA can pull down more Ab2–GOx–MB on the PS substrate,
thus inducing more H2O2. Owing to the fact that
all the samples generated less than 100 mM of H2O2, in which larger sized AuNP clusters were formed, leading to purple
colored solution, which agreed well with the results in Figure 2.

Figure 3 Quantitative immunoassay of PSA in PBS and sera samples.
(a) Naked-eye
detection of PSA with different concentrations in PBS and fetal bovine
sera. (b) Plots of A530nm values versus
different concentrations of PSA. Error bar: standard deviation of
three independent measurements.

Furthermore, the naked-eye results were validated by measuring
the absorbance at 530 nm on a conventional microplate reader. The
calibration curves shown in Figure 3b suggested
that the linear detection ranges for both cases are from 10 to 105 fg/mL. This linear range is much wider than that of HRP-based
ELISA, indicating that our immunoassay is particularly useful for
quantitative detection of biomarkers whose concentrations are from
fg/mL to pg/mL. For the spiked PSA in PBS, the LOD defined by a signal-to-noise
ratio of 3 was determined to be 3.1 fg/mL (93 aM), while that for
PSA spiked in sera was 4.6 fg/mL (138 aM). By contrast, the LOD of
HRP-based ELISA for PSA in sera was 0.21 ng/mL (6.3 pM; Figure S9, Supporting Information), at least 4 orders of
magnitude higher than that of the AuNP-based immunoassay.

The
excellent detection sensitivity can be attributed to two rounds
of signal amplification. In the first round, MBs are used to load
many thousands of GOx, which are then conjugated with detection antibodies
via copper-free click chemistry. It is understandable that more GOx
can generate more H2O2, thus producing more
Au(0). In the second round, the activity of the loaded GOx is highly
maintained, and the anchored GOx can catalyze its substrate glucose
oxidase to generate H2O2. H2O2 can react with AuCl4– in the
presence of 5 nm AuNP seeds and thus causes the enlargement of AuNPs,
whose extinction coefficients (108–1010 M–1 cm–1) are much higher than
those of organic dyes. This Au growth event can be reflected by the
color emergence of the AuNP solutions from colorless to purple, which
can be observed by the naked eye. A very small amount of the analyte
can thus be detected because of the high density of GOx on MB and
the Au growth reaction.

Encouraged by the unprecedented sensitivity
and wide linear detection
range for PSA, 12 patient sera with prostate cancer and 5 healthy
sera were employed to evaluate the capability of our assay in the
real world. The results were compared with the HRP-based ELISA. The
differentiation of positive and negative signals depended on the clinical
threshold, which was indicated by the horizontal dotted line. As shown
in Figure 4a, all 12 patient sera were positively
detected by the AuNP-based immunoassay; that is, the A530nm values are clearly above the clinical threshold,
which was set to be 0.085. Meanwhile, the signals for the 5 healthy
samples were below the clinical threshold, indicating that the AuNP-based
immunoassay provides 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for PSA.
In comparison, two patient sera (Nos. 4 and 9) were not positively
detected by HRP-based ELISA (Figure 4b); that
is, the OD450nm values were below the clinical threshold
(where the OD450nm value is 0.05). The results are not
surprising because of the moderate sensitivity of HRP-based ELISA,
which may not reach the clinical concentrations of PSA in certain
patient sera (generally below 0.1 ng/mL).

Figure 4 Detection of PSA in human
sera using the AuNP-based quantitative
immunoassay and comparison with HRP-based ELISA. PSA samples collected
from 12 prostate cancer patient sera and 5 healthy sera (control)
were used to evaluate the detection performance of (a) AuNP-based
immunoassay and (b) conventional HRP-based ELISA. All patient sera
were unambiguously detected by the AuNP-based immunoassay, while HRP-based
ELISA failed to detect two patient sera (Nos. 4 and 9, as indicated
by asterisk (*) in panel b). (c) Results of the quantitative detection
of PSA in clinical samples by the AuNP-based immunoassay were compared
with HRP-based ELISA. Error bars show the standard deviations of three
independent measurements.

To demonstrate that the AuNP-based immunoassay can accurately
quantify
target molecules in biological samples, the patient sera samples were
diluted using fetal bovine serum by 10 000-fold to correspond
to the linear range of the calibration curve. As a comparison, the
undiluted patient sera were also screened by HRP-based ELISA. Results
from the two methods showed excellent correlation, and no significant
difference in quantifying the amounts of PSA was observed (P > 0.05) (Figure 4c). On the
basis
of the calibration curve, the PSA concentrations in patient Nos. 4
and 9 that were undetectable by HRP-based ELISA were determined to
be 0.031 and 0.0056 ng/mL, respectively, by the AuNP-based immunoassay.
These results indicate that the AuNP-based immunoassay not only can
be used for the identification of very low concentrations of cancer
protein biomarkers in clinical samples by the naked eye but also can
quantitatively measure the biomarkers in a wide linear range.

Conclusions
In summary, we have designed a quantitative immunoassay to detect
cancer biomarkers in clinical samples with very high analytical figures
of merit. Unlike traditional AuNP-based assays, which generally depend
on the monodisperse or aggregated state of AuNPs, this presented assay
is based on the enzyme-catalyzed growth of 5 nm AuNPs, leading to
the emergence of red color. The color emergence can be easily distinguished
by the naked eye, making this format particularly suitable for POC
diagnostics in both resource-rich and resource-limited settings.27−33 Furthermore, owing to its unprecedented sensitivity and wide linear
range, this immunoassay was able to quantitatively measure very low
levels of cancer biomarkers in clinical samples. Although only PSA
was used as a proof-of-concept, this approach is generalizable to
be readily extended to other ELISA systems.
