Metabolomics
is a rapidly evolving analytical approach in life and health sciences.
The structural elucidation of the metabolites of interest remains
a major analytical challenge in the metabolomics workflow. Here, we
investigate the use of ion mobility as a tool to aid metabolite identification.
Ion mobility allows for the measurement of the rotationally averaged
collision cross-section (CCS), which gives information about the ionic
shape of a molecule in the gas phase. We measured the CCSs of 125
common metabolites using traveling-wave ion mobility-mass spectrometry
(TW-IM-MS). CCS measurements were highly reproducible on instruments
located in three independent laboratories (RSD < 5% for 99%). We
also determined the reproducibility of CCS measurements in various
biological matrixes including urine, plasma, platelets, and red blood
cells using ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled
with TW-IM-MS. The mean RSD was < 2% for 97% of the CCS values,
compared to 80% of retention times. Finally, as proof of concept,
we used UPLC–TW-IM-MS to compare the cellular metabolome of
epithelial and mesenchymal cells, an in vitro model used to study
cancer development. Experimentally determined and computationally
derived CCS values were used as orthogonal analytical parameters in
combination with retention time and accurate mass information to confirm
the identity of key metabolites potentially involved in cancer. Thus,
our results indicate that adding CCS data to searchable databases
and to routine metabolomics workflows will increase the identification
confidence compared to traditional analytical approaches.

==== Body
Metabolomics,
a powerful analytical
strategy in translational medicine and biomarker discovery, relies
on advanced technology to profile metabolites in cells, tissues, and
biofluids.1−3 The confident identification of these metabolites
on a high-throughput scale, however, remains a major analytical challenge
because of their chemical and structural diversity. Thus, implementing
workflows that involve orthogonal analytical tools might facilitate
metabolite identification.4

Mass
spectrometry (MS) is a widely used technique for analyzing small molecules.5 Because of the complexity of the metabolome,
MS-based metabolomics analyses are usually performed in conjunction
with liquid chromatography (LC).5 Analyzing
hydrophilic compounds by means of traditional reversed-phase LC–MS
is not ideal as these metabolites are poorly retained and usually
elute in the void volume.6,7 On the other hand, it
has been demonstrated that hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography–MS
(HILIC–MS) improves resolution, identification, and quantification
for these types of compounds.7−10 Intersample variability caused by using different
matrixes and sample loading, however, can lead to shifts in retention
times, which complicates the use of retention time for identification
purposes.

The coupling of UPLC with ion mobility MS (UPLC–IM-MS)
is a promising analytical technique within the field of metabolomics.11−16 Ion mobility spectrometry is a gas-phase electrophoretic technique
that separates ions according to their charge, shape, and size. Ion
separation occurs in the millisecond time frame, making it compatible
with time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The CCS17 for a given ion can be derived by measuring the time required
for an ion to traverse a chamber filled with an inert gas. The CCS
value is a unique physicochemical property of a molecule. Using CCS
as an orthogonal molecular descriptor in addition to retention time
and mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) offers
the opportunity to further improve the identification process, making
it more robust and reproducible across multiple samples and timeframes.13−16,18−23 Such an approach remains largely unexplored in metabolomics applications.

During this study, we incorporated ion mobility into the UPLC–MS,
metabolomics workflow. We generated a CCS database of common cellular
metabolites, validated across multiple laboratories, which was ultimately
used to confidently identify the metabolic alterations related to
the epithelial–mesenchymal transition process. Our study highlights
the benefit of using ion mobility in metabolomics

Experimental

All materials were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(Germany) unless stated otherwise. Acetonitrile (ACN) was purchased
from Merck KGaA, (Darmstadt, Germany). Water was obtained using an
18 Ω m Milli-Q (EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA). All
chemicals and solvents were of analytical grade or higher purity.
Poly-dl-alanine (product number P9003) was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (U.K.). Platelets (PLT), red blood cells (RBC), and

Mixtures containing between 10 and 15 standard metabolites
(each with a different molecular weight) were prepared in H2O/ACN (50:50, v:v), at a concentration of 10 mg/L.

Biological
Samples
A volume of 0.5 mL of PLT and RBC concentrates were
used to extract intracellular metabolites using methanol (MeOH)/H2O (7:3, v:v), as previously described.7 The supernatant was dried and reconstituted in 0.3 mL of H2O/ACN (50:50, v:v). Plasma samples (0.3 mL) were processed by adding
0.9 mL of MeOH. After centrifugation (10 min, 4 °C, 10 000g), the supernatant was dried and reconstituted in 0.15
mL of H2O/ACN (50:50, v:v). Urine samples (0.2 mL) were
processed adding 0.6 mL of MeOH. After centrifugation (10 min, 4 °C,

and 5% CO2. After 3 days in culture, the cells were trypsinized,
collected by centrifugation, counted, and washed three times with
PBS. Intracellular metabolites were extracted using MeOH/H2O (7:3 v:v) as previously described.7

MS Analysis
Three traveling-wave ion mobility mass spectrometers
(TW-IM-MS)25 (Synapt G2 HDMS, Waters Corporation,
Manchester, U.K.) located in independent laboratories were used to
derive CCS information for a variety of small low molecular weight,
polar metabolites (Table S1 in the Supporting
Information).

The first Synapt HDMS system was located
in Durham, NC. In positive electrospray mode, the capillary and cone
voltage were 2.6 kV and 35 V, respectively. The source and desolvation
temperatures were 100 and 150 °C, respectively, and the desolvation
gas flow was 600 L/h. Nitrogen, the IMS gas, flowed at a rate of 90
mL/min (3.2 mbar), with a wave velocity of 600 m/s and wave height
of 40 V. In negative electrospray mode, the capillary and cone voltage
were 2.3 kV and 25 V, respectively. The source and desolvation temperature
were 100 and 150 °C, respectively, and the desolvation gas flow
was 600 L/h. Nitrogen, the IMS gas, flowed at a rate of 90 mL/min
(3.2 mbar), with a wave velocity of 650 m/s and wave height of 40
V. The EDC delay coefficient was specified as 1.36 V in positive mode
and as 1.41 in negative mode. In both positive and negative mode,
direct injection at a flow rate of 0.75 μL/min was used.

The second Synapt HDMS system was located in Manchester, U.K. In
positive electrospray mode, the capillary and cone voltage were 2.5
kV and 30 V, respectively. The source and desolvation temperature
were 100 and 250 °C, respectively, and the desolvation gas flow
was 600 L/h. Nitrogen, the IMS gas, flowed at a rate of 90 mL/min
(3.2 mbar), with a wave velocity of 750 m/s and wave height of 40
V. In negative electrospray mode, the capillary and cone voltage were
2 kV and 40 V, respectively. The source and desolvation temperature
were 100 and 250 °C, respectively, and the desolvation gas flow
was 600 L/h. Nitrogen, the IMS gas, flowed at a rate of 90 mL/min
(3.2 mbar), with a wave velocity of 800 m/s and wave height of 40
V. The EDC delay coefficient was specified as 1.58 V. Direct injection
at a flow rate of 5 μL/min was used in both positive and negative
mode.

The third Synapt HDMS system was located in Reykjavik,
Iceland. In positive electrospray mode, the capillary and cone voltage
were 1.5 kV and 30 V, respectively. The source and desolvation temperature
were 120 and 500 °C, respectively, and the desolvation gas flow
was 800 L/h. Nitrogen, the IMS gas, flowed at a rate of 90 mL/min
(3.2 mbar), with a wave velocity of 600 m/s and wave height of 32
V. In negative electrospray mode, the capillary and cone voltage were
1.5 kV and 30 V, respectively. The source and desolvation temperature
were 120 and 500 °C, respectively, and the desolvation gas flow
was 800 L/h. Nitrogen, the IMS gas, flowed at a rate of 90 mL/min
(3.2 mbar), with a wave velocity of 600 m/s and wave height of 32
V. The EDC delay coefficient was specified as 1.58 V. Argon served
as collision gas in both positive and negative mode. During HDMSE experiments, the collision energy in the trap cell was 4
eV (Function 1), and in the transfer cell, it ranged from 20 to 30
eV (Function 2). In both positive and negative mode, direct injection,
at a flow rate of 0.75 μL/min, or UPLC was used.

Liquid Chromatographic
Analysis
Chromatographic separation was achieved using an
ACQUITY UPLC system (UPLC ACQUITY, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA)
and hydrophilic-interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) using a
1.7-μm (2.1 mm × 150 mm) ACQUITY amide column (Waters Corporation).
Samples and standard mixtures were analyzed three times in UPLC–HILIC-HDMSE, once in positive ionization mode and twice in negative ionization
mode using acidic and basic chromatographic conditions, respectively.
In positive mode and in negative acidic conditions alike, mobile phase
A was 100% ACN and mobile phase B was 100% H2O, with both
containing 0.1% formic acid. The following elution gradient was used:
0 min, 99% A; 6 min, 40% A; 8 min, 99% A; 10 min, 99% A. In negative-mode
basic conditions, mobile phase A contained ACN/sodium bicarbonate,
10 mM (95:5) and mobile phase B contained ACN/sodium bicarbonate,
10 mM (5:95). The following elution gradient was used: 0 min, 99%
A; 5 min, 42% A; 6 min, 70% A; 7 min, 99%; 10 min, 99% A. In all conditions,
the flow rate was 0.4 mL/min, the column temperature 45 °C, and
the injection volume 3.5 μL.

CCS Measurements for Metabolites
CCS values obtained in nitrogen were experimentally determined
using previously published CCS values for singly charged polyalanine
oligomers as the TW mobility calibrant26,27 (Table S2, Supporting Information). Experimental procedures
for measuring CCS are outlined in Figure S1 (see the Supporting Information for more details). Poly-dl-alanine was used as the calibrant species in both electrospray positive
(ES+) and ES– and was prepared in H2O/ACN (50:50, v:v) at a concentration of 10 mg/L. Calibration
was performed using oligomers from n = 3 to n = 11, covering a mass range from 231 to 799 Da and a CCS
range from 151 Å2 to 306 Å2 in ES+ and from 150 Å2 to 308 Å2 in ES– (Table S2, Supporting
Information).26 CCSs were derived
using a procedure previously reported.26 The ion mobility resolution was ∼40 (fwhm). The ion mobility
peak or arrival time distribution (ATD) may represent a combination
of structurally similar isomers that remain unresolved. The CCS values
reported were determined at the apex of the ion mobility peak or ATD.
The use of different ionization sources (causing different interferences
that are not resolved) and/or different mobility calibrants could
lead to slight variations in the reported CCS.28

Prediction of CCS via Computational Methods
Theoretical collisional cross sections were calculated as follows.
First, two- dimensional (2D) structures for the compounds were downloaded
from NCBI’s PubChem database29 in
SD file format. Following this, ChemAxon’s (ChemAxon, 5.4.1.1.)
pKa module was used to calculate the most
acidic or most basic atom in each 2D structure. Protonated and sodiated
forms were generated by connecting a hydrogen or a sodium atom to
the most basic atom in the 2D structure. The formal charge of the
most basic atom was then set to +1. Similarly, a hydrogen attached
to the most acidic atom was disconnected to generate deprotonated
structures. Then, ChemAxon’s conformer plugin was used to generate
molecular mechanics (using MMFF94 force field) based lowest energy
conformers. Each molecular mechanics based minimum energy conformer
was reoptimized with the density functional theory B3LYP/6-31g*. Density
functional calculations were done with Gaussian09.30 All structure manipulations (generation of ionized forms
and molecular mechanics based conformers) and input file preparations
(for Gaussian09 and Mobcal) were done using MolFind’s tools
panel.31 Finally, a modified version of
Mobcal32−34 optimized according to the room temperature N2-based trajectory method (TM) was used for calculating average
collision cross-sectional areas.

Data Processing and Analysis
Progenesis QI v1.0 (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle, U.K.) was used
for visualization, processing, and interpretation of multidimensional
IM-MS data. Each UPLC–IM-MS run was imported as an ion intensity
map, including m/z and retention
time. These ion maps were then aligned in the retention time direction.
From the aligned runs, Progenesis QI produces an aggregate run that
was representative of the compounds in all samples and used this aggregate
run for peak picking. The peak picking from this aggregate was then
propagated to all runs, so that the same ions are detected in every
run. Isotope and adduct deconvolution was applied to reduce the number
of features detected. Data were normalized using total ion intensity.
The software was coded to directly convert drift time data into CCS
values using the polyalanine calibration curve. Statistically significant
alterations were identified using multivariate statistics, including
principal components analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least square-discriminant
analysis (OPLS-DA) and further confirmed using analysis of variance
(ANOVA). Metabolites were identified by searching in the Human Metabolome
Database (HMDB),35 METLIN,36,37 and in-house databases with Δppm < 10, retention time range
< 0.3 s, and ΔCCS < 5 Å2 as tolerance
parameters. Fragment ion mass spectra were analyzed in both MSE and HDMSE mode.

Results and Discussion
Investigating the use of ion mobility to support metabolomic applications,
we conducted a multilaboratory study to obtain the CCS values of 125
standard metabolites, using both experimentally derived and computationally
calculated approaches. This data was used to create a unique database,
which contained not only retention time and m/z information, but also CCS values for each structure. In
order to validate the database and its unique capabilities, we conducted
metabolomics analyses of biological samples using the additional CCS
information to aid in the identification of metabolites.

Experimentally-
and Computationally Derived CCSs of Common Metabolites
Experimental
procedures for measuring CCSs are based on calibration with compounds
having known CCS values as reported in the Experimental
Section (Figure S1, Supporting Information). In order to represent the chemical complexity of the cellular
metabolome, we selected as unknowns 125 metabolites representing key
metabolic pathways. These metabolites included sugars, phosphorylated
compounds, purines and pyrimidines, nucleotides, nucleosides, acylcarnitines,
carboxylic acids, hydrophilic vitamins and amino acids (Figure 1 and Table S3 in the Supporting
Information). We measured drift times in nitrogen for these
metabolites using TW-IM-MS instruments located in three independent
laboratories (Table S4, Supporting Information). We then derived CCS values using polyalanine oligomers as mobility
calibrants in both positive and negative ES mode of operation. The
polyalanine standards allowed us to correct for variation in drift
times between instruments located in different laboratories and having
different ion mobility parameter settings (Figure 2a). We derived 209 CCS values (96 in positive and 113 in negative
ion mode) with an interlaboratory RSD% lower than 5% for 99% of the
measurements (Figure 2b). These results support
the proposition that a CCS value derived from calibration is an absolute
measurement, representing a physicochemical property that is consistent
across a range of experimental and instrumental conditions. Experimentally
derived CCS values highlighted trend lines related to different chemical
classes (Figure 1c). Furthermore, experimentally
derived CCS values correlated closely with theoretical CCS calculated
using Mobcal (Figure 1d and Table S4, Supporting Information).

instruments: (a) different drift time values for reduced glutathione

Generation of a Database Containing Retention Time, CCS, and m/z Values
To allow a more comprehensive
LC separation of the different classes of compounds used in this study,
we coupled UPLC with TW-IM-MS. Notably, the analysis of polar metabolites
using traditional reversed-phase LC–MS presents some challenges
because they are poorly retained and usually eluted in the void volume.6−10 Two different HILIC methods (i.e., acidic and basic) were used (for
details see the Experimental Section). Basic
conditions were chosen to separate phosphorylated compounds, such
as nucleotides and sugar phosphates, which under acidic conditions
were strongly retained, resulting in poor chromatographic peak shape.7,8 Using HILIC conditions, our set of polar metabolites eluted in order
of increasing polarity (Table S3, Supporting Information). For each of the 125 compounds included in this study, we annotated
values for accurate mass, CCS, and retention time, creating a database
that was then used to analyze biological samples.

Application
of Ion Mobility-Derived Information to the Analysis of Biological
Samples
To evaluate the applicability of this approach to
metabolomic applications, we analyzed plasma, urine, red blood cells
(RBCs), and platelets (PLTs) using UPLC–TW-IM-MS. In these
experiments, we calculated the ΔCCS (the difference between
the database CCS and the experimental CCS) and used this as a contribution
to the identification score in addition to retention time and accurate
mass. This enabled us to search for metabolites whose identifications
have a CCS error less than a given threshold. Thus, we were able to
filter and score identifications when querying our database with CCS
information. Using CCS, retention time, and accurate mass as orthogonal
coordinates, a total of 94 different metabolites were confirmed to
be present in the various biological matrixes (48 in plasma, 46 in
urine, 74 in RBCs, and 71 in PLTs).

The retention time of a
given metabolite can change from one run to the next due to experimental
drift (e.g., room/column temperature and degradation of the column).
Moreover, different sample matrixes can influence the reproducibility
of retention times, largely due to different salt and lipid contents.
Figure 3a shows the extracted-ion chromatogram
of arginine in different matrixes, highlighting the effect of the
matrix on retention time. In Figure 3b, we
present the extracted-ion chromatogram resulting from the ion mobility
separation showing the absence of the matrix effect on drift time.
Our results showed a RSD% <2 for 97% of the CCS measurements, compared
with 80% for the retention time values, suggesting that CCS measurements
are more stable and reliable than retention time and thus may add
more confidence in the identification process during metabolomics
experiments (Figure 3c,d).

mobility chromatograms of arginine analyzed in four different biological
matrixes (plasma, red blood cells, platelets, and urine). (c) Retention
times reproducibility and (d) CCSs reproducibility in the various
biological matrixes.

To confirm the identity of the metabolites, we performed
the analysis using data-independent or UPLC–“MSE” mode of acquisition, which alternates between a low
and elevated collision energy regime. At low collision energy, the
exact mass measurements of unfragmented precursor ions are obtained,
whereas at the elevated collision energy, the product ions for all
precursors are obtained.38,39 In biological samples,
however, multiple analytes often have indistinguishable retention
times. Consequently, applying elevated collision energy in MSE mode might lead to the generation of product ions derived
from multiple precursor ions at a given retention time, complicating
the identification process (Figure S2, Supporting
Information). To overcome this problem, we used a combination
of MSE and ion mobility, HDMSE, which allows
the drift time separation of coeluting precursor metabolites before
the fragmentation process takes place. Precursor ions and fragment
ions were ion mobility-aligned to filter out fragments that do not
match the precursor’s drift time. Precursor separation was
important for obtaining a cleaner collision-induced dissociation spectrum
that is not contaminated from a mixture of coeluting compounds. The
use of ion mobility thus provided a simplified and cleaned product
ion spectrum that facilitated the identification process (Figure S2, Supporting Information). HDMSE ultimately
resulted in a better performance in terms of converting feature detected
in metabolites identified, increasing the ratio feature/metabolites
compared to a typical LC–MS.40 Such
results are in agreement with previous studies showing that HDMSE provides better clarity and depth of coverage for the analysis
of complex samples compared to regular MS approaches.41−43 In an in depth analysis of the precision and accuracy of HDMSE, it has been shown that with ion mobility activated, the
number of ion detections and accurate-mass retention-time pairs increased
at an average rate of 24.4 and 26.6%, respectively, while at the same
time, the average number of ion interference events dropped from 20.2
to 5.4%.41−43

Application of Ion Mobility-Derived Information
to Metabolomics
We applied the approach described above to
investigate the metabolic alterations occurring during the epithelial–mesenchymal
transition process. Such a process occurs during embryonic development
whereby epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal, fibroblast-like properties
and display reduced intracellular adhesion and increased motility.
It is also the means by which malignant epithelial tumors metastasize.24,44,45 This tightly regulated process
is associated with a number of cellular and molecular events, many
of which are not yet characterized.

In order to shed light on
the metabolic events leading to the differentiation of epithelial
and mesenchymal cells, we compared the metabolome of D492 breast epithelial
cells (n = 4) with that of D492 M epithelially derived
mesenchymal cells (n = 4) using HILIC UPLC–TW-IM-MS.
Data processing and analysis highlighted three molecular features
as major contributors to the variance between epithelial and mesenchymal
cells (Figure 4 and Figure S3, Supporting Information). The accurate-mass measurements
of these discriminating features were searched against HMDB and METLIN
and resulted in a list of potential identifications based on accurate-mass
error (<5 ppm). Review of such a list was supported by the use
of HDMSE fragmentation spectra, retention time, and isotopic
pattern deviation (Figure 4). Drift time data
of unknown species were directly converted to CCS values by calibrating
with polyalanine ions of known CCS, providing an additional coordinate
for metabolite characterization (Figure 4 and
Figure S3, Supporting Information). Comparing
the experimental CCS values with those reported in our database, we
were able to confirm the identity of inosine and guanosine as two
of the features of interest (ΔCCS = 0.1% Å2 for
inosine and ΔCCS = 0.4% Å2 for guanosine) (Figure 4). The third molecular feature at m/z 135.0309 was identified as a hypoxanthine-like
fragment derived from in-source breakdown of inosine (Figure 4). These results indicate that CCS can be used as
an orthogonal analytical parameter alongside the traditional molecular
identifiers of precursor accurate mass, fragment ion accurate mass,
isotope pattern, and chromatographic retention time as a confirmation
of metabolite identity to increase the confidence of identification.46

Figure 4 Experimentally determined CCS information in support of
metabolite identification. Retention times, m/z, CCS, isotopic pattern, and fragmentation information
were used to identify metabolites that had a statistically significant
alteration during the epithelial–mesenchymal transition process:
(a) overlaid, extracted-ion chromatograms of inosine and guanosine

for inosine in HDMSE mode. (c) Low- and high-energy spectra
for guanosine in HDMSE mode. Data processing and analysis
performed using Progenesis QI v1.0.

An obvious limitation of this approach is that it is impractical
to prepare a completely comprehensive database containing experimental
CCS’s for all compounds present across metabolomes. An alternative
strategy that would potentially alleviate this problem is the use
of computationally predicted CCSs.31 In
cases where mass measurements and Δppm are not able to differentiate
between potential candidate metabolites obtained from a database search,
a comparison between the experimental and theoretical CCS values can
support the identification process. As an example, the accurate m/z at 267.0728 for inosine was searched
against the HMDB and METLIN database leading to four potential candidates,
with Δppm < 5 ppm (Table 1). Three
out of the four matches had identical Δppm values but different
CCS values. In such a case, ΔtCCS (the difference
between the theoretical CCS and the experimental CCS) was used to
filter the potential candidates, increasing the confidence of identification
for inosine (the compound with the lowest ΔtCCS,
Table 1). These results indicate that computationally
predicted CCS might be used as an indicator of compound structure
to aid metabolite identification during searches in large metabolite
database, potentially reducing the number of false positive and false
negative identifications.

Conclusions
In this study, we integrated ion mobility into a typical LC–MS-based
workflow for routine metabolomics applications. The use of ion mobility
in combination with UPLC–MS and UPLC–MS/MS increased
the system peak capacity and specificity for metabolite identification.
Ion mobility was used to measure CCS values for 125 metabolites across
three independent laboratories, demonstrating high intra- and interlaboratory
reproducibility. The creation of a searchable database for metabolites
that includes CCS as an orthogonal analytical measurement, in addition
to retention time and m/z, increased
the confidence of metabolite identification compared to traditional
LC–MS approaches. Metabolomics applications using direct infusion
or desorption ionization sources in combination with TW-IM-MS could
particularly benefit from the use of CCS-containing databases to support
metabolite identification.20,47−49 We encourage further studies to extend and populate existing metabolite
databases with CCS values for metabolomics and other small molecules
applications.
