Mass
spectrometry imaging (MSI) has proven to be a valuable tool
for drug and metabolite imaging in pharmaceutical toxicology studies
and can reveal, for example, accumulation of drug candidates in early
drug development. However, the lack of sample cleanup and chromatographic
separation can hamper the analysis due to isobaric interferences.
Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) uses unique precursor ion-product
ion transitions to add specificity which leads to higher selectivity.
Here, we present a targeted imaging platform where desorption electrospray
ionization is combined with a triple quadrupole (QqQ) system to perform
MRM imaging. The platform was applied to visualize (i) lipids in mouse
brain tissue sections and (ii) a drug candidate and metabolite in
canine liver tissue. All QqQ modes were investigated to show the increased
detection time provided by MRM as well as the possibility to perform
dual polarity imaging. This is very beneficial for lipid imaging because
some phospholipid classes ionize in opposite polarity (e.g., phosphatidylcholine/sphingomyelin
in positive ion mode and phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylethanolamine
in negative ion mode). Drug and metabolite images were obtained to
show its strength in drug distribution studies. Multiple MRM transitions
were used to confirm the local presence and selective detection of
pharmaceutical compounds.

==== Body
Drug discovery
and development
aims to find suitable candidates that can inhibit or activate a pathway
to have a positive effect in a disease state.1 The desired effect is the potential drug being distributed to the
target site and bound to the biological receptors, present for a certain
amount of time at a high enough concentration.2 However, if a drug candidate or its metabolite(s) accumulates in
tissue, it can result in significant toxicological effects. In addition,
these effects can also derive from the presence of specific (secondary)
drug metabolites. Therefore, toxicology studies are key in deciding
whether a potential drug will be further developed.3 Analytical tools are thus required for species identification
and localization. Current imaging technologies, like quantitative
whole-body autoradiography (qWBA), examine drug distribution but require
radiolabeling and therefore cannot distinguish between possible drugs
and their metabolites.4

Mass spectrometry
imaging (MSI) allows label-free drug distribution
investigation because of its ability to map drug candidates and metabolites
simultaneously.2,3,5 Matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) is often combined with MSI due
to its high spatial resolution, sensitivity, and throughput. However,
difficulties in MALDI-MSI can arise due to inhomogeneity in matrix
application and the possible interferences arising from matrix-related
signals, especially in the absence of high mass resolving power. Lately,
ambient liquid ionization techniques have complemented MALDI-MSI,
as they do not require external matrixes to facilitate analysis. Desorption
electrospray ionization (DESI)6 was introduced
by Cooks and coworkers and has established itself as the main ambient
tool for MSI. DESI uses an electrospray emitter to map extracted molecules
directly from the cryosectioned tissue sample. The main advantages
of DESI are the minimal sample preparation required prior to analysis
and its compatibility with subsequent histological staining.7 DESI imaging of lipids8,9 is
the most popular, but the pharmaceutical industry has gained interest
in the technology10 for applications like
drug blood-brain barrier permeability11 and cassette dosing.12

Independent
of the ionization source, constant technical improvements
are made to improve MS detection. The integration of ion mobility
separation (IMS)13,14 with MSI increases selectivity
by reducing the interference from isobaric background compounds. Use
of not only IMS but also high mass resolution MSI15,16 allows the separation of isobaric interference from targeted analytes,
which is beneficial for drug analyses where chemical background from
biological samples is a real burden. Even though the mass resolving
capability of the newest high resolution instruments is significant,
examples are found in literature of isobaric compounds that could
not be separated.17 In consequence, a more
selective tandem MS (MS/MS) approach is required to separate these
isobaric compounds and is generally executed using a triple quadrupole
(QqQ) instrument. Although referred to as a QqQ by mass spectrometrists,
most commercially available QqQ instruments nowadays use only two
quadrupole mass analyzers and, therefore, are often called tandem
quadrupole (TQ) instruments.18 In consistency
with the MS field, we refer to the TQ system as a QqQ instrument.19 The QqQ used for the studies described in this
paper uses a first quadrupole (Q1) followed by a (nonquadrupolar)
collision cell (q) for precursor fragmentation and second quadrupole
(Q3) to either select or scan ions. The system can be used in different
modes:20,21 MS scan (Q1 operates in RF only mode, no
fragmentation, Q3 is scanning), product ion scan (Q1 is selecting,
Q3 is scanning; PROD), precursor ion scan (Q1 is scanning, Q3 is selecting;
PREC), neutral loss scan (Q1 is scanning and Q3 is scanning with an
offset specific for a neutral fragment; NL), and multiple reaction
monitoring (Q1 and Q3 are selecting; MRM). Once the precursor and
product ions are known, a targeted and high-throughput MRM method
can analyze multiple compounds simultaneously. In addition, the system
enables dual polarity imaging in one experiment. Polarity switching
has been explored previously for lipid MS imaging.22 MALDI-QqQ imaging has also improved sensitivity for drug
distribution studies.23,24 Other MALDI-MRM drug applications
have been focused on skin analysis25 and
forensics.26,27 MRM imaging allows for quantitative
MSI approaches due to its wide dynamic range.28

Here, we report the benefits of using a QqQ mass spectrometer
for
targeted DESI-MS imaging, which is illustrated with different sets
of experiments. First, the improved specificity of MRM is compared
with the QqQ scanning modes for multiple lipid classes in rat brain
tissue. In addition, DESI-MRM was applied to map a drug candidate
and its metabolite in canine liver. At last, lipid imaging of rat
brain tissue was performed to prove the benefit of dual polarity imaging.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Reagents
ULC/MS-grade water (H2O), ULC/MS-grade methanol (MeOH), ULC/MS-grade ethanol (EtOH), and
99% formic acid (FA) were purchased from Biosolve (Valkenswaard, NL).
Microscopic glass slides were purchased from Thermo Scientific (Braunschweig,
DE). Drug standard (compound A) was provided by Janssen R&D (Beerse,
Belgium).

Tissue Collection and Preparation
Rat brain and canine
liver were used in this research. MAASTRO clinic (Maastricht, NL)
provided Wistar Albino Glaxo Rat brain tissues that were snap frozen
in liquid nitrogen. Janssen R&D (Beerse, Belgium) provided canine
liver tissues dosed with a drug candidate A at 65 mg/kg. For confidentiality
reasons, structural information on the drug candidate cannot be revealed.
All tissue samples were stored at −80 °C until cryosectioning.
Fresh-frozen tissues were cryosectioned using a Microtome cryostat
(Thermo Scientific, Braunschweig, Germany) into 12 μm-thick
tissue sections and thaw mounted on microscope glass slides, stored
at −80 °C, and air-dried prior to DESI-QqQ analysis.

DESI-QqQ Instrumentation
A Xevo TQ-S micro was equipped
with a DESI source for the MSI analysis (Waters, Wilmslow, UK). DESI
solvent (MeOH/H2O, 98/2, v/v) was supplied by a Waters
ACQUITY UPLC M-class binary solvent manager at 2–5 μL/min.
For positive ionization experiments, 0.1% FA was added to the DESI
solvent. General parameters were: N2 nebulizing gas pressure
= 3–5 bar; spray voltage = ±3–4 kV; MS source temperature
= 150 °C; sampling cone voltage = 25 V. A custom-built inlet
capillary was heated to 300–500 °C. Pixel sizes differed
per MSI analysis from 30 to 100 μm. Mass resolution settings
were optimized to unit resolution. NL/PREC/PROD scan times ranged
from 0.995 to 2.496 s/pixel, and MRM dwell times ranged from 0.199
to 0.999 s/pixel. All images were acquired with Omni Spray 2-D version
2.0.1 (Prosolia, Indianapolis, IN, USA) combined with MassLynx version
4.1 (Waters, Milford, MA, USA).

Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)
Staining
H&E staining
was executed on the same tissue sections after DESI-QqQ analysis.
The tissue sections were washed in successive EtOH baths (100, 96,
and 70%) and deionized water for 3 min each. Hematoxylin (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany) staining was executed for 3 min followed by a gentle 3 min
wash with running tap water. Eosin staining was performed for 30 s,
followed by a gentle wash with running tap water for 3 min. The protocol
was finalized by a 1 min EtOH wash and a 30 s xylene wash for dehydration.
Coverslips were placed on the stained tissues using Entellan. A MIRAX
Desk scanner (Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany) was used to acquire optical
images.

Data Processing and Visualization
For all QqQ imaging
experiments, individual line scans were acquired. For individual MRM
transitions, all raw line scan files were converted into mzML with
MSConvertGUI (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, United States)
and further processed by an in-house written MATLAB script (v. R2015a).
To visualize NL/PREC/PROD images, raw line scan files were directly
processed by a MATLAB script.

Results and Discussion
Scanning
versus MRM
MRM mode was investigated and compared
with several scanning modes to target multiple high and low abundant
lipid classes.29 In positive ion mode,
a DESI-PREC imaging experiment was executed to scan for precursors
with the m/z 184 fragment ion29 corresponding to protonated phosphatidylcholine
(PC) and sphingomyelin (SM) lipids. Based on the PREC spectrum (Figure S-1) 5 lipid species at variable abundance
were selected. The corresponding MRM transitions were used in a DESI-MRM
imaging experiment on a consecutive tissue section. The same strategy
was used for the experiments in negative ion mode. First, a DESI-NL
scan of 87, corresponding to deprotonated phosphatidylserine (PS)
lipids, was performed.30 This was followed
by a DESI-MRM imaging experiment (consecutive tissue section) of 5
corresponding MRM transitions selected from the NL spectrum (Figure S-2). Figure 1 shows the resulting MS/MS images of 10 lipid
species of which 5 were obtained in positive ion mode (PC and SM,
left 2 columns) and 5 in negative ion mode (PS, right 2 columns).
Using MRM for MS imaging experiments significantly adds specificity
to the analysis compared to MS scan. The terms specificity and selectivity
are often confusingly used. Selectivity is the ability of a method
to distinguish between the analyte and its sample matrix. Specificity
is the ability to measure one specific analyte in the presence of
its sample matrix (i.e., 100% selectivity for one specific analyte).31 With MRM imaging, the selection of the fragment
ion corresponding to the precursor ion adds specificity to the analyte
and, therefore, measures this compound at near 100% selectivity. This
allows separation of compounds with selectivity higher than that of
current high mass resolving power MS technologies. Lanekoff et al.
combined nanospray DESI with multiplexed MS/MS imaging.32 In this work, MRM could separate both isobaric
metabolites and isobaric lipids where current high mass resolving
power MS failed. An example is the separation of the [M + Na]+ ion of phosphatidylethanolamine PE(P-16:0/22:6) at m/z 770.5095 from the [M + K]+ ion of PC 32:1 at m/z 770.5097.
The use of MRM versus PREC/NL scanning modes increases the total detection
time per precursor ion. For instance, in NL scanning mode, [PS(44:10)-H]− is acquired at an acquisition rate of 20,000 Da/sec
over a m/z 500–1000 mass
range at a scan rate of 2.496 s/pixel. This leads to a total detection
time of 62.4 ms/pixel for the [PS(44:10)-H]− ion.
In MRM mode, at the same total analysis time, the image of [PS(44:10)-H]− was acquired at 999 ms/pixel. This results in MRM
images from low-abundant lipid species (<1% for PS(44:10)) that
are poorly detected in NL scanning mode. Not only is DESI-MRM imaging
more selective but also significantly reduces analysis costs relative
to high mass resolving MS imaging of isobars, which can be an argument
for implementation in the pharmaceutical industry.

Figure 1 TIC images acquired in
scanning and MRM modes. Left two columns
show images acquired in positive ion mode, and the right two columns
show images acquired in negative ion mode. In the left two columns,
DESI-PREC images (scan time 0.995 s) are compared with DESI-MRM images
(dwell time 0.199 s/MRM) of the same species. The right two columns
show the DESI-NL images (scan time 2.496 s) and their related DESI-MRM
images (dwell time 0.999 s/MRM). Pixel size is 100 μm. H&E
images are displayed at the bottom of each column.

Confirmation of Spatial Localization of Drug
and Metabolites
Due to the additional specificity of DESI-MRM
imaging, this technology
is a suitable tool to pharmaceutical studies. The canine liver tissues
used for this MRM imaging application are obtained from an investigation
of a possible drug candidate for prostate cancer: Compound A with
a molecular weight of 515 g/mol ([A+H]+ ion at m/z 516) which is metabolized into the
demethylated metabolite M1 at 501 g/mol ([M1+H]+ ion at m/z 502). Based on preliminary experiments
performed in Janssen R&D, a NL spectrum of 418 was obtained followed
by a PROD spectrum of compound A. This information was used in the
selection of two specific MRM transitions for each compound (m/z 516 → m/z 98, m/z 516 → m/z 488; m/z 502 → m/z 84, m/z 502 → m/z 474). To confirm spatial distribution, all MRM transitions are used
to map the drug candidate and its metabolite. Figure 2 shows two MRM images of compound A (Figure 2a and 2b) and two of metabolite M1 (Figure 2c and 2d). All MRM
images reveal significant accumulation of A and M1 in tissue lesions,
which are visible in the H&E images and highlighted by arrows
in Figure 2e. Additional
MALDI-MSI experiments were executed and display similar distribution
of A and M1 (Figure S-3) to complement
the DESI-MRM data. The accumulation of compound A correlates with
histological lesions previously annotated by the pathologist and indicates
severe fibrosis, which resulted in the exclusion of compound A from
further development. It is worth mentioning that the occurrence of
ion suppression and/or enhancement due to the presence of bile acids
in the bile duct may influence the detected levels of compound A.33 However, qualitative MSI provides pharmaceutical
researchers with unique understanding of drug distribution.4 This qualitative information benefits significantly
from selective MS detection. Our data shows that MRM imaging can not
only be used for this selective detection of drugs and metabolites
but also for spatial confirmation (e.g., accumulation at the same
location) by monitoring multiple MRM transitions per compound.

Figure 2 Spatial distribution
of compounds A (a and b) and M1 (c and d)
by two MRM transitions. H&E image (e) shows tissue lesions (pointed
by arrows) in the canine liver. Spatial resolution is 50 μm.
Dwell time/MRM is 0.299 s.

Dual Polarity MS Imaging
In addition to the improved
specificity, another benefit of using a QqQ mass spectrometer is the
ability to perform fast dual polarity experiments. Figure 3 shows two applications of
dual polarity MRM imaging: lipid imaging in rat brain and drug/metabolite
imaging in canine liver. In the lipid imaging application, the images
of four MRM transitions of which two transitions (Figures 3b and c) were acquired in
positive ionization mode, and two transitions (Figures 3d and e) were obtained in negative ionization
mode in one experiment. Even though shown in MRM mode, the dual polarity
capacity also applies to the scanning modes of the QqQ. This means
that lipid classes can be evaluated based on both positive and negative
charged head groups and/or acyl chains in one single experiment. In
the pharmaceutical application, compounds A and M1 are mapped (Figures 3g and h) in positive
ionization mode, and two bile acids are targeted (Figures 3i and j) in negative ionization
mode. The main advantage of dual polarity MS imaging is that the information
acquired originates from the same tissue section and, therefore, significantly
reduces analysis time. Previous untargeted dual polarity MSI investigations34 using Orbitrap mass spectrometers have shown
that polarity switching takes up to multiple seconds to reach the
expected mass accuracy. The benefit of saving analysis time got lost
because this one experiment takes twice as long. Nazari and coworkers35 improved the polarity switching capability of
the Orbitrap MS to a 96 ms switching time. Our QqQ MSI experiments
have very limited elongation of analysis time because the polarity
switching time is 15 ms. Ellis et al.22 showed the benefit of dual polarity lipid imaging in a classification
model throughout tumor tissue using MALDI-MSI. The use of dual polarity
MALDI imaging has the limitation that a MALDI matrix has to be applied,
which can cause potential inferences, risks delocalization, and requires
sample preparation time. DESI imaging does not require an external
matrix to facilitate ionization and, therefore, does not suffer from
these limitations. Taylor and coworkers reported the investigation
of ion suppression of olanzapine on mouse brain where DESI ionization
suffered from significantly less ion suppression than MALDI ionization.36 Depending on the chemical structure of the drug
candidate, this makes DESI dual polarity imaging of potentially more
interest for the pharmaceutical industry over MALDI dual polarity
imaging. In pharmaceutical sciences, the possibility of drugs and
its metabolites ionizing in different polarities is also very probable.
For instance, a drug that ionizes in positive mode will ionize in
negative mode after glucuronide or sulfate conjugation.37 In addition, possible endogenous markers for
drug candidates could also ionize best in the opposite ionization
mode (e.g., bile acids for bile duct cancer drugs). This is also shown
in our drug/metabolite application in which two possible drug candidates
and two bile acids are imaged and show colocalization. The ability
to map drug candidates, drug metabolites and endogenous metabolites
in one experiment is crucial in further targeted imaging analyses
and, therefore, DESI dual polarity imaging can play an important role.

Figure 3 Dual polarity
DESI-MRM imaging performed in one experiment. In
rat brain, four different DESI-MRM images of lipids were acquired,
of which two in positive ion mode (b and c; dwell time 0.193 s/MRM)
and two in negative ion mode (d and e; dwell time 0.193 s/MRM). In
positive ion mode, two MRM transitions target the PC headgroup, while
two different acyl chains are targeted in negative ion mode. Spatial
resolution is 100 μm. In canine liver, two MRM transitions target
compound A and M1 in positive ion mode (g and h; dwell time 0.485
s/MRM), and two MRM transitions image bile acids in negative ion mode
(i and j; dwell time 0.498 s/MRM) that are colocalized with A and
M1. Spatial resolution is 30 μm. H&E images of rat brain
and canine liver are shown in (a) and (f), respectively.

Conclusion
This work demonstrates
a novel targeted DESI imaging platform by
using a QqQ mass analyzer combined with a targeted MS/MS-based data
acquisition approach. The opportunity to perform dual polarity imaging
combined with DESI is very advantageous for lipid and metabolite imaging
because it does not rely on MALDI matrixes. QqQ scanning modes were
compared with MRM showing increased ion detection time of MRM. This
opens doors for the separation of isobars and certain isomers which
cannot be separated with current high mass resolving power MSI technologies.
Although this targeted platform requires fragmentation knowledge,
the MSI field will significantly benefit from this as its applications
are increasing. Our platform shows its strength in toxicology studies
by selective imaging of drugs and metabolites in tissue. Spatial distribution
is confirmed by monitoring the presence of pharmaceutical compounds
using multiple MRM transitions of the same precursor ion. DESI-MRM
imaging allows for selective imaging without the need for expensive
MSI instrumentation.

MSI can suffer from lower sensitivity compared
to techniques that
combine mass spectrometry with a separation step prior to ionization.38 The use of MRM in the MS imaging field is very
promising because improved selectivity is needed to visualize more
compounds without the interference of surrounding isobars.
