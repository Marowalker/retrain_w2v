Chemical
cross-linking combined with mass spectrometry (MS) is
powerful to provide protein three-dimensional structure information
but difficulties in identifying cross-linked peptides and elucidating
their structures limit its usefulness. To tackle these challenges,
this study presents a novel cross-linking MS in conjunction with electrochemistry
using disulfide-bond-containing dithiobis[succinimidyl propionate]
(DSP) as the cross-linker. In our approach, electrolysis of DSP-bridged
protein/peptide products, as online monitored by desorption electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry is highly informative. First, as disulfide
bonds are electrochemically reducible, the cross-links are subject
to pronounced intensity decrease upon electrolytic reduction, suggesting
a new way to identify cross-links. Also, mass shift before and after
electrolysis suggests the linkage pattern of cross-links. Electrochemical
reduction removes disulfide bond constraints, possibly increasing
sequence coverage for tandem MS analysis and yielding linear peptides
whose structures are more easily determined than their cross-linked
precursor peptides. Furthermore, this cross-linking electrochemical
MS method is rapid, due to the fast nature of electrochemical conversion
(much faster than traditional chemical reduction) and no need for
chromatographic separation, which would be of high value for structural
proteomics research.

==== Body
Studies of
protein three-dimensional
(3D) structures and protein–protein interactions (PPIs) help
understand protein biological functions. Traditional methods, such
as X-ray crystallography1 and NMR,2 have been used for this purpose for decades due
to their high resolution. However, a large amount of sample is required,
which becomes a major limitation.3 In addition,
X-ray crystallography requires crystals, and NMR is limited to small
protein analysis. Protein structural analysis by mass spectrometry
(MS) is highly sensitive. It can be coupled with different techniques,
such as hydrogen–deuterium exchange (H/D exchange),4,5 hydroxyl radical footprinting,6−8 and chemical cross-linking,9−15 as a low-resolution method for probing protein 3D structures. The
advantage of chemical cross-linking is that cross-linking reactions
can be performed in a native buffering environment to obtain covalently
modified proteins that can be analyzed by MS subsequently (typically
in conjunction with chromatographic separation16). By utilizing a bottom-up approach, protein sizes are
unlimited, since enzymatic digestion can be used to produce small
peptides for detection.

However, several experimental obstacles
limit the usefulness of
chemical cross-linking. One major challenge is the identification
of cross-linked peptides in the complex mixture produced by enzymatic
digestion of the modified protein or protein complex. Another difficulty
is the complexity of the fragmentation patterns of cross-linked peptides,
which makes the tandem MS-based structural determination to be problematic.
A cross-linked precursor may display a mixed fragmentation series
owing to the presence of two peptide sequences, and further complexity
is created by the presence of cross-linked fragments and amino acids
with partial cross-linking reagent attached. This complexity can be
greatly reduced by cleaving the cross-link prior to MS/MS identification,
yielding easily identifiable linear peptides. Therefore, a cross-link
reagent, which is cleavable and also allows ease identification of
cross-links, would be ideal for the cross-linking MS. Great efforts
were made to solve these problems. Successful approaches for rapid
identification of cross-links from complex mixtures include using
isotope,17,18 fluorescence,19 and affinity tag-labeled cross-linkers20 or using characteristic reporter ions that could be generated by
MS/MS ion dissociation.21,22 For releasing cross-linked
peptides, photocleavable groups were introduced to cross-linkers that
could be cleaved upon light irradiation.11 Chemically cleavable cross-linkers were also prepared and regarded
helpful to the identification of cross-linking products with their
characteristic mass shifts after chemical reduction.23 Alternatively, collision-induced dissociation (CID) cleavable
cross-linkers contributed to the identification process by producing
specific fragmentation patterns in addition to backbone cleavage.21,24,25

Dithiobis[succinimidyl
propionate] (DSP, structure shown in Scheme
S-1a, Supporting Information) is a disulfide-bond-containing
cross-linking reagent with the characteristics of having selective
reactivity toward amine groups of proteins and being chemically reducible.
In addition, it is compatible with the use of various buffers for
reaction, and the produced amide products are soluble in buffer.26 Furthermore, its membrane penetrable property
offers utility for in vivo cross-linking study.27 Typically, chemical reductants such as dithiothreitol are
used for reducing DSP-cross-linked products, but the reduction requires
an excess amount of reductant and takes over 30 min.23 The disulfide bond of DSP cross-linked products is also
cleavable upon CID in the negative ion mode.25,28−30 Unfortunately, the disulfide bond cleavage in the
positive ion mode is suppressed by backbone dissociation and hard
to be observed.25 Other novel approaches
for cleaving disulfide bonds include laser-based ionization,31 ultraviolet photodissociation,32 electron-capture dissociation,33 electron-transfer dissociation,34 plasma-induced
oxidation,35,36 reactive electrospray-assisted
laser desorption/ionization,37 or using
new ion chemistry.38,39

Herein, we present a novel
cross-linking approach of using DSP
as the cross-linking reagent in conjunction with electrochemical mass
spectrometry (EMS; refers to the online combined electrochemistry
EC with MS) for probing protein 3D structures and PPIs. The EMS technique
is powerful in the identification of the electrochemical reaction
products or intermediates,40,41 leading to extensive
applications in bioanalysis and mechanistic studies of redox reactions.42−44 The advantage of adopting MS as an EC detector stems from the fact
that MS is sensitive and can provide molecular weight information
and that tandem MS can be also used for structural analysis based
on ion dissociation. The EMS technique used in this work is the combined
EC/MS method coupled with desorption electrospray ionization (DESI45), which was recently developed in our laboratory
for studying electrochemical reaction mechanisms and protein/peptide
electrochemistry.41,44,46−51 In this cross-linking study, because of the fact that a disulfide
bond is electrochemically reducible,41,44,46−51 electrolytic reduction provides a fast and “clean”
method to cleave DSP cross-linked products without using chemical
reductants and to provide linear reduced peptide products, thus facilitating
the obtaining of sequence information and linkage information on the
cross-linked products. In addition, upon electrolysis, the large relative
intensity drop of the cross-link ions suggests a new approach for
the identification of cross-links. The concurrent formation of the
reduced peptides helps confirm the assignment of the precursor cross-links.
Furthermore, different from the negative ion CID or laser-based cleavage
of disulfide bond-containing ions, the side reactions such as C–S
bond cleavage is avoided in the electrochemical reduction. As the
electrochemical reduction occurs in solution, there is also a freedom
to ionize the resulting reduced peptides/proteins into either positive
or negative ions for both MS and MS/MS analysis. Also, mass shift
before and after electrolytic reduction for cross-link peptide ions
indicates the type of cross-links. Furthermore, this cross-linking
EC/DESI-MS method is rapid, due to the fast nature of electrochemical
conversion.

In the study, ubiquitin, insulin, and the calmodulin–melittin
complex were chosen as model proteins or protein complexes for the
validation of our approach. Our results reveal that the DSP cross-linking
reaction truly targets on solvent accessible residues of the proteins/protein
complexes (either the N-terminal amine or lysine residue) and the
identified intrapeptide and interpeptide cross-links are in good agreement
with the previously reported literature results and 3D structures,14,52,53 showing the feasibility of probing
protein 3D structures or PPIs using this cross-linking electrochemical
MS.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
Peptide HCKWFF was purchased
from Bachem
AG. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and
other peptides/proteins used were all purchased from Sigma–Aldrich.
DSP (MW 404.4 Da) was purchased from Thermo Scientific. Formic acid
(FA) was purchased from Spectrum Chemical Mfg. Corp (Gardena, CA).
HPLC-grade methanol was purchased from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn,
NJ). The deionized water used for sample preparation was obtained
using a Nanopure Diamond Barnstead purification system (Barnstead
International, Dubuque, IA).

DSP Cross-Linking Experiments
Typically,
an aqueous
solution containing peptides, proteins, or protein complexes in PBS
buffer was mixed with DSP in DMSO for effecting cross-linking reactions.
Then, NH4HCO3 was used to quench the reaction,
and either a C18 Ziptip or a cutoff filter was used for desalting
before the EC/DESI-MS analysis. The experimental procedure is detailed
in the Supporting Information.

Apparatus
The home-built apparatus for coupling a thin-layer
electrochemical flow cell with a mass spectrometer by liquid sample
DESI (Scheme S-2, Supporting Information) was used and described in detail previously.47 Except the insulin data that was collected using a Thermo
Finnigan LCQ DECA ion trap (San Jose, CA), all other data was acquired
using a Waters Xevo QTOF mass spectrometer (Milford, MA). The sample
syringe and μ-PrepCell electrochemical thin-layer flow cell
were connected using a piece of PEEK capillary tube, and the sample
solution was injected for electrolysis at a flow rate of 5 μL/min.
The thin-layer flow cell equipped with a magic diamond electrode (12
mm × 30 mm, Antec BV, Netherlands) as the working electrode was
employed, and a Roxy potentiostat (Antec BV, Netherlands) was used
to apply a reduction potential to the cell. The reduced species flowed
out of the thin-layer cell via a piece of fused silica capillary and
then underwent ionization by DESI. Unless otherwise specified, the
spray solvent for DESI was methanol/water (1:1 by volume) containing
1% FA at the injection flow rate of 5 μL/min, and a high voltage
of +5 kV was applied to the DESI spray probe. CID was carried out
for ion structural analysis.

This cross-linking EC/DESI-MS technique
we used turns out to be sensitive and comparable to traditional cross-linking
MS methods. The cross-links could be detected using the protein digests
with an injection concentration of 20 μM (see the detailed experimental
procedure in the Supporting Information), which has no significant difference from the injection concentrations
of 10–25 μM used in traditional cross-linking MS methods.54,55

Results and Discussion
In cross-linking experiments,
analyzing how the protein is modified
by cross-linker provides rich information about the protein 3D structure.
The modified protein typically undergoes enzymatic digestion to produce
peptides and subsequent liquid chromatography (LC)/MS and LC/MS/MS
analysis. Dead-end peptide cross-links in the digested protein originate
from the reaction of protein with only one reactive group of the cross-linker,
providing information about the solvent accessibility of the reacted
protein residue. If both ends of cross-linking reagents react with
two residues of the same protein molecule, intramolecular inter- or
intrapeptide cross-links are formed after the reaction and enzymatic
digestion, providing proximity information for the two cross-linked
residues. Intermolecular interpeptide cross-links, formed through
bridging protein and its binding substrate with the cross-linking
reagent, offer the most valuable information about the distance between
the protein and substrate during their interaction. In the case of
DSP, the cross-linking reaction may yield different products, dead-end
cross-links, intrapeptide cross-links, and interpeptide cross-links
(Scheme S-1, Supporting Information). The
dead-end cross-links (Scheme S-1b, Supporting
Information) carry a modification tag of −C(O)CH2CH2SSCH2CH2COOH
that increases molecular weight by 192 Da in comparison to unmodified
peptides. The unreacted end of the cross-linker hydrolyzes into a
carboxylic acid group. Upon electrochemical reduction, the dead-end
cross-links will have a 104 Da mass decrement by loss of HSCH2CH2COOH. The intrapeptide cross-links (Scheme
S-1c, Supporting Information) carry a modification
tag of −C(O)CH2CH2SSCH2CH2C(O)– (174 Da mass increment in comparison
to unmodified peptides) and will have 2 Da increment upon electrolysis.
Similarly, interpeptide cross-links (Scheme S-1d, Supporting Information) also carry a tag of −C(O)CH2CH2SSCH2CH2C(O)–
but will be reduced into two smaller linear peptides. These features
are useful in recognizing the linkage patterns of cross-links.

To examine the feasibility of the proposed method, a lysine-containing
peptide HCK3FWW was first chosen as a test sample. Figure 1a shows the DESI-MS spectrum of the peptide after
reaction with DSP. Besides the doubly charged HCK3FWW seen
at m/z 453.7, two doubly charged
ions of peptides P1 (m/z 540.7)
and P2 (m/z 549.7) are observed.
On the basis of the measured masses, P1 has a mass increment of 174.0
Da in comparison to the intact HCK3FWW, which indicates
that P1 is an intrapeptide cross-link. P2 has a mass shift of 192.0
Da compared to the intact peptide, suggesting it as a dead-end product.
It is expected that cross-links would have decreased intensity after
electrolysis. Indeed, after electrolytic reduction (Figure 1b), the relative intensities of the doubly charged
ion of P1 (m/z 540.7) and doubly
charged ion of P2 (m/z 549.7) dropped
by 62% and 37% (using the disulfide-bond-free peptide ion [HCK3FWW + 2H]2+ at m/z 453.7 as the reference; Table S-1, Supporting
Information), respectively. The pronounced reduction of ion
intensity would be useful for the fast identification of cross-linked
products in a complicated digestion mixture. Furthermore, a new peptide
[H▲CK3FWW + 2H]2+ (▲ denotes one reduced tag of −C(O)CH2CH2SH) at m/z 497.7 appeared as a
result of P2 reduction with mass loss of 104.0 Da (a characteristics
for dead-end cross-link reduction, Scheme S-1b, Supporting Information) confirming the assignment of P2 as
a cross-linked product. Likewise, there is another +2 ion observed
at m/z 541.7 (Figure 1b) as a result of reduction of P1 with mass increment of 2.0
Da (a characteristic for intrapeptide cross-link reduction, Scheme
S-1c, Supporting Information), also confirming
the assignment of P1 as an intrapeptide product.

in (a) shows the structures of cross-linked P1 and P2, and inset in
(d) shows the MS3 spectrum of the b1▲ ion with the proposed structure.

CID MS/MS analysis was applied
to gain further structural information.
Upon CID, the +2 ion of P1 (m/z 540.7)
gave rise to unmodified y1 and y2 and modified fragment ions b3•, b4•, b4–H2O•, b5•, a52+•, and b52+•
(• denotes the intrapeptide cross-linking modification tag
of −C(O)CH2CH2SSCH2CH2C(O)–; Figure 1c). The presence
of b3•–b5• indicates that the N-terminal and the Lys residue
of P1 were cross-linked as they were the only possible cross-linking
sites for this peptide. CID of the reduced P1 ion (m/z 541.7) yielded y1, y2, y5▲, b1▲, b3▲▲, b4▲▲, b4–H2O▲▲, b5▲▲, a52+▲▲, and b5–H2O 2+▲▲ (Figure 1d). The formation
of fragment ions b1▲ and y5▲ results from
the removal of the constraint of disulfide bond of P1 via electrolytic
reduction, providing more backbone cleavage and facilitating sequencing
the cross-link. Note that the b1 ion is
typically not stable56−59 and the observation of the b1▲ ion in this case is probably due to the stabilization of the b1▲ ion with the reduced tag
of −C(O)CH2CH2SH (see the proposed b1▲ structure in Figure 1d, inset). The MS3 of the b1▲ ion (Figure 1d, inset) shows the loss of carbon monoxide (CO), in agreement with
the previously reported b1 ions.60 Furthermore, CID of the reduced P2 ion (m/z 497.7) gave rise to a complete set
of fragment ions y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, b1▲, b2▲, b3▲, b4▲, and b5▲ (Figure S-1b, Supporting
Information), clearly showing that dead-end modification site
is on the peptide N terminus rather than the lysine residue.

The formation of intrapeptide product P1 (structure shown in Figure 1a, inset) suggests that both the N-terminal amine
and the lysine residue of P1 are solvent accessible and close to each
other, agreeing with the peptide structure. As a small peptide, the
access to these two residues would have small steric hindrance. However,
only one dead-end product P2 (structure shown in Figure 1a, inset) with the modified N terminus was produced, further
suggesting that the N-terminal amino group is more reactive than the
lysine residue. In this experiment, P1 and P2 are easily recognized
by observing their intensity changes before and after electrolytic
reduction. Furthermore, newly reduced products help obtain increased
structural information by tandem MS analysis. To our knowledge, this
result, for the first time, experimentally shows that the DSP disulfide
bond can be electrochemically cleavable. With knowing the basic features
of our EC/DESI-MS method, we further investigate its applications
to the cross-linking study of ubiquitin, insulin proteins, and the
calmodulin–melittin protein complex.

Insulin
Insulin
contains two chains A and B that are
linked by two disulfide bonds, and there is an additional intrapeptide
disulfide bond in the A chain (structure shown in Figure 2a, inset). For this protein, there are three possible
reactive sites for DSP: N termini of two chains and the K29 residue of the B chain. Because of the small size of the protein,
direct analysis of the cross-linked insulin by EC/DESI-MS was applied
without using enzymatic digestion. Figure 2a shows the positive ion DESI-MS spectrum of native insulin cross-linked
in neutral PBS buffer, in which +5 ions of unmodified and modified
insulin molecules appear at m/z 1147.9
and m/z 1186.1, respectively. The
191.0 Da mass difference of the two protein ions is approximately
equal to the mass of a dead-end modification tag (192 Da; the mass
deviation might be due to the low mass accuracy for LCQ DECA ion trap
instrument used for the +5 ion measurements) and indicates that the
modified protein carries one dead-end cross-link tag (structure shown
in Figure 2a, inset). The modified insulin
ion is labeled as 5+′ (′ denotes a dead-end tag of −C(O)CH2CH2SSCH2CH2COOH).
After electrolytic reduction (Figure 2b), in
comparison to the +4 ion of the unmodified B chain at m/z 851.2, the +4 ion of the modified B chain at m/z 872.7 (labeled as B chain4+▲) has a mass increment of 86.0 Da, which is close to the mass of
one reduced dead-end tag (88 Da). This modified B chain is the product
of the modified insulin by reducing all three insulin inherent disulfide
bonds and the disulfide bond of the dead-end tag. Interestingly, a
+5 ion of the partial reduction product carrying one reduced dead-end
tag from the modified insulin by only reducing the disulfide bond
of the dead-end tag is seen at m/z 1165.3 in Figure 2b (labeled as 5+▲ ion), providing another example of disulfide bond partial electrochemical
reduction.47 The preferred reduction of
the dead-end cross-linking tag is probably due to its small steric
hindrance (as shown below, the dead-end tag is on the N terminus of
the B chain). However, in Figure 2b, the A
chain was not detected in the positive ion mode, probably due to its
low proton affinity, as electrolysis occurs in solution and ionization
in the negative ion of the reduced protein would be favorable to detect
A chain. In this regard, it is straightforward to use DESI-MS to generate
negative ions from acidic protein solution (acid is in need for electrochemical
reduction) as one can simply change the DESI spray solvent from methanol/water
(containing 1% FA) to methanol/water (containing 1% NH4OH), which is a unique application of liquid sample DESI-MS44,61 for realizing “wrong-way-around” ionization.62 Indeed, with the negative ion DESI-MS detection,
doubly charged anion of intact A chain is observed at m/z 1167.8 after electrolysis and modified A chain
ion is not (Figure S-2b, Supporting Information), suggesting that the A chain was not modified. Again, doubly charged
anion of the modified B chain carrying one reduced dead-end tag is
observed m/z 1742.0 (Figure S-2b, Supporting Information), further confirming that
the sole modified position of the native insulin was on its B chain.

the structures of intact insulin and insulin with one dead-end modification.
Inset in (b) shows the structure of insulin with two dead-end modifications.

CID helped to further locate the
modification site of the B chain,
and the positive ion MS/MS mode was adopted as it provided more fragment
ions than the negative ion mode. On the basis of the observation of
unmodified fragment ions of y182+ and y192+ from CID MS/MS
of the B chain4+▲ ion (Figure 2e), the lysine residue K29 is considered not to be modified.
Furthermore, the observation of many modified fragment b ions such as b102+▲–b142+▲ (Figure 2e) points out that the modification position is
at the N terminus of the B chain. This result agrees with the solvent
accessibility (shown in Table S-2, Supporting
Information) that the B chain N terminus is solvent accessible
for native insulin while the lysine residue K29 is not.
However, the failure of the reaction with the A chain N terminus might
be due to the possibility that the N terminus of the A chain is involved
in salt bridge formation63 so that it becomes
less solvent accessible.

In addition to studying the cross-linking
of native insulin, denatured
insulin (by urea denaturation) was also interrogated. Figure 2c displays the negative ion DESI-MS spectrum of
denatured and cross-linked insulin, in which −4 ions of intact
insulin and modified insulin with one dead-end tag are observed at m/z 1432.6 and at m/z 1481.1, respectively. Besides, one additional −4
ion at m/z 1529.1 is seen, with
mass increment of 386.0 Da from intact insulin that is roughly equivalent
to two dead-end tags (the mass deviation might be due to the low mass
accuracy for LCQ DECA ion trap instrument used in this experiment).
After electrolytic reduction (Figure 2d), doubly
charged anions of intact and modified B chains are detected at m/z 1698.9 and m/z 1742.4, respectively. In addition, doubly charged anions
of the A chain and the modified A chain with one reduced dead-end
tag are detected at m/z 1167.9 and m/z 1211.8, respectively. On the basis
of the DSP reaction specificity, the cross-linking modified position
of the A chain should be the N terminus, which is the only possible
cross-linked site. Clearly, under the denaturing condition used in
this experiment, the salt bridge of the A chain N terminus might be
destroyed to release a free N terminus for cross-linking modification
by DSP. However, the K29 of the B chain is still protected
and not accessible for DSP modification.

Ubiquitin
Ubiquitin
in neutral PBS buffer was reacted
with DSP for cross-linking, followed with trypsin digestion and EC/DESI-MS
analysis. Figure 3a shows the DESI-MS spectrum
of the resulting digested and cross-linked protein, in which unmodified
peptide ion [TITLEVEPSDTIENVK + 2H]2+ (m/z 894.4, from ubiquitin) and [LGEDNINVVEGNEQFISASK
+ 2H]2+ (m/z 1082.0,
from autolytic digestion of trypsin) are observed. Upon electrolysis
(Figure 3b), four peptide ions, [P3 + 2H]2+ (m/z 769.8), [P4 + 3H]3+ (m/z 775.0), [P5 + 2H]2+ (m/z 948.9), and [P6 +
3H]3+ (m/z 1217.2) experienced
large relative intensity decrease (by 34–100% using disulfide
bond-free peptide ion [LGEDNINVVEGNEQFISASK + 2H]2+ as the reference peak, Table S-3, Supporting
Information), which suggests that P3–P6 are possible
cross-links. The charge states of the four peptide ions can be determined
based on their isotopic peak distributions as measured by the QTOF
instrument used in this case. In contrast, the unmodified peptide
ion [TITLEVEPSDTIENVK + 2H]2+ (m/z 894.4) underwent a much smaller intensity change
(decreased by 7% probably due to MS signal fluctuation; Table S-3, Supporting Information), in line with the fact
that it does not have electrochemically active disulfide bonds.

Figure 3 DESI-MS spectra
of tryptic digest of cross-linked ubiquitin (a)
before and (b) after electrochemical reduction (applied potential:
−1.5 V). Inset in (a) shows the structures of cross-links P3
to P6, and inset in (b) shows the X-ray 3D structure of ubiquitin
(PDB: 1UBQ).

Furthermore, three new reduced
peptide ions appear in Figure 3b and are assigned
as [LIFAGK48▲QLEDGR + 2H]2+ (m/z 717.8), [TLSDYNIQK63▲ESTLHLVLR + 3H]3+ (m/z 740.0), and [AK29▲IQDK33▲EGIPPDQQR +
2H]2+ (m/z 949.9), based
on their CID data and the known sequence of ubiquitin. CID of [LIFAGK48▲QLEDGR + 2H]2+ (m/z 717.8, Figure 4b) gave
rise to y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y82+▲, y92+▲, y7▲, y8▲, y9▲, y10▲, y11▲, b2, b3, b4, b7▲, b8▲, and b9▲, covering most of the backbone cleavage and pinpointing the modification
position at the lysine residue K48. Likewise, the CID of
reduced peptide [TLSDYNIQK63▲ESTLHLVLR + 3H]3+ (m/z 740.0, Figure 4c) generated y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7, y8, y9, y122+▲, y162+▲, y10▲, y11▲, y12▲, and b2, also covering most of the backbone cleavage
and pinpointing the modification site at the lysine residue K63. Furthermore, as the sum of the masses of newly generated
peptides LIFAGK48▲QLEDGR (measured mass: 1433.6
Da) and TLSDYNIQK63▲ESTLHLVLR (measured mass:
2217.0 Da) is larger than the mass of P6 (measured mass: 3648.6 Da)
by 2.0 Da, P6 would be the interpeptide cross-linking product of two
peptides LIFAGK48QLEDGR and TLSDYNIQK63ESTLHLVLR. This hypothesis is confirmed by CID data. CID of
[P6 + 3H]3+ (m/z 1217.2,
Figure 4a) yielded fragment ions A(y3), A(y4), A(y5), A(y6), B(b7), B(y3), B(y4), B(y5), B(y6), B(y7), B(y8), B(y9), B(y10)A2+, B(y11)A2+, B(y12)A2+, and B(y16)A2+. For
the denotation, A and B represent peptide chains LIFAGK48QLEDGR and TLSDYNIQK63ESTLHLVLR, respectively.
The B(y10)A2+ ion refers to
the doubly charged y10 ion from the B chain carrying an
intact A chain. From CID spectra shown in Figure 4, it can be seen that analysis of reduced linear peptide chains
by MS/MS is easier than analysis of the cross-linked precursor peptide.
The structure of the determined interpeptide cross-link P6 is shown
in Figure 3a, inset.

Figure 4 CID MS/MS spectra of
(a) [P6 + 2H]2+ (m/z 1217.2);
(b) [LIFAGK48▲QLEDGR
+ 2H]2+ (m/z 717.8);
and (c) [TLSDYNIQK63▲ESTLHLVLR + 3H]3+ (m/z 740.0).

In addition, as the mass difference between P3 (measured
mass:
1537.6 Da) and newly generated peptide LIFAGK48▲QLEDGR (measured mass: 1433.6 Da) is 104.0 Da; P3 might be
the simple dead-end cross-link of LIFAGK48QLEDGR.
This assumption is confirmed by CID of the +2 ion of P3 (m/z 769.8, Figure S-3a, Supporting
Information) showing the formation of fragment ions y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7′, y8′, y82+′, y9′, y92+′, y10′, y102+′, y11′, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6′, b7′, b8′, b9′, and b11′. Likewise, P4 is shown to be the dead-end cross-link of
TLSDYNIQK63ESTLHLVLR (Figure S-3c, Supporting Information). For product P5, the intensity of
its +2 ion at m/z 948.9 dropped
after electrolysis (Table S-3, Supporting Information) while an adjacent +2 ion [AK29▲IQDK33▲EGIPPDQQR + 2H]2+ at m/z 949.9 was generated. The mass difference of 2.0 Da suggests
P5 as an intrapeptide cross-link of AK29IQDK33EGIPPDQQR and the only possible cross-linking is to bridge
K29 and K33 by DSP. CID of [P5 + 2H]2+ (m/z 948.9) yielded y6, y8, b8•, and b9•, and
CID of [AK29▲IQDK33▲EGIPPDQQR
+ 2H]2+ (m/z 949.9) produced y6, b8▲▲, and b9▲▲,
(Figure S-3e and S-3f, Supporting Information), in line with their structure assignments.

In this case of
ubiquitin cross-linking, it can be seen that four
different cross-linking products are identified (structures shown
in Figure 3a, inset), including two dead-end
products (P3 and P4), one intrapeptide product (P5), and one interpeptide
product (P6). The formation of P5 tells that K29 and K33 of ubiquitin are solvent accessible and the same intrapeptide
cross-link was observed previously.25 In
particular, identification of the interpeptide cross-link P6 further
shows that K48 and K63 residues are within the
distance that DSP can span (ca. 24 Å based on the structural
similarity of DSP with DSS).64 Indeed,
it was reported that the distance between the two residues is 17.9
Å52 (the proximity of two residues
can also be seen in the X-ray 3D structure of ubiquitin, Figure 3b, inset).

Calmodulin–Melittin Complex
Besides individual
proteins such as insulin and ubiquitin, we also testified our methodology
for probing protein/substrate interaction, and the calmodulin–melittin
complex was chosen as a test sample. In the DESI-MS spectrum of cross-linked
and trypsin-digested calmodulin–melittin complex (Figure 5a), unmodified peptide ions from calmodulin and
melittin are detected, including [VLTTGLPALISWIK + 2H]2+ (m/z 756.5), [HVMTNLGEKLTDEEVDEMIR
+ 3H]3+ (m/z 787.4),
[EADIDGDGQVNYEEFVQMMTAK + 2H]2+ (m/z 1246.0) and [VLTTGLPALISW + H]+ (m/z 1270.7). Upon electrolytic
reduction (Figure 5b), these unmodified peptide
ions have a small intensity change of +3%∼−15% as summarized
in Table S-4 (using disulfide-bond-free peptide ion [VLTTGLPALISWIK
+ 2H]2+ as the reference). In contrast, four other ions
denoted as [P7 + 3H]3+ (m/z 744.7), [P8 + H]+ (m/z 849.4), [P9 + 2H]2+ (m/z 930.5), and [P10 + 2H]2+ (m/z 974.4) underwent a large intensity decrease by 38–60%
(Table S-4, Supporting Information), indicating
that they are possible cross-links. In addition, four newly reduced
products were generated and assigned as peptide ions [K23▲R + H]+ (m/z 391.2),
[G1▲IGAVLK + H]+ (m/z 745.4), [VLTTGLPALISWIK21▲R +
2H]2+ (m/z 878.5), and
[VFDK94▲DGNGYISAAELR + 2H]2+ (m/z 922.4), based on CID data
and the known sequences of calmodulin and melittin.

Figure 5 DESI-MS spectra of the
tryptic digest of the cross-linked calmodulin–melittin
complex (a) before and (b) after electrochemical reduction (applied
potential: −1.7 V). Inset in (a) shows the structures of cross-links
P7–P10, and inset in (b) illustrates the 3D structure of the
calmodulin–melittin complex.

CID of [VFDK94▲DGNGYISAAELR
+ 2H]2+ (m/z 922.4, Figure
S-4c, Supporting Information) produced y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7, y9, y10, y11, y12, y13▲, y14▲, b2, b3, b4▲, b5▲▲, b6▲, b7▲, and b10▲, nearly covering all of backbone cleavages and pointing
out the cross-linking site at K94 of calmodulin (i.e.,
the fourth residue of peptide VFDK94DGNGYISAAELR).
CID of another newly generated peptide ion [K23▲R + H]+ (m/z 391.2)
gave rise to y1 and y2▲ (Figure S-4b, Supporting Information), suggesting the sequence of the peptide
as K23▲R (from melittin) and the modification position
at K23 of melittin. Interestingly, among P7 to P10, the
mass sum of peptides K23▲R (measured mass: 390.2
Da) and VFDK94▲DGNGYISAAELR (measured
mass: 1842.8 Da) is higher than the mass of P7 (measured mass: 2231.1
Da) by 1.9 Da, which provides the clue that P7 is an interpeptide
product consisting of the K23R chain from melittin and
the VFDK94DGNGYISAAELR chain from calmodulin
(see the structure of P7 in Figure 5a, inset).
This hypothesis along with the ion structure assignment was confirmed
by CID MS/MS analysis of [P7 + 3H]3+ (m/z 744.7) (Figure S-4a, Supporting
Information) by observing A(y2),
A(y5), A(y6), A(y7), A(y8), A(y9), A(y10), A(y11), A(y12), A(y13)B, and A(y14)B.

Upon CID, the newly resulting peptide ion [G1▲IGAVLK + H]+ (m/z 745.4)
(Figure S-5b, Supporting Information) yielded y1, y2, y3, y4, b2▲, b3▲, b4▲, and b5▲, confirming its sequence
and locating the modification site at the N terminus of G1IGAVLK (from melittin). According to the mass difference between
P8 (measured mass: 848.4 Da) and the reduced product G1▲IGAVLK (measured mass: 744.4 Da), the mass decrease of 104.0 Da suggests
that P8 is the dead-end cross-link precursor of GIGAVLK (see the structure
of P8 in Figure 5a inset), which is further
confirmed by CID of P8 (Figure S-5a, Supporting
Information). Similarly, we assigned P9 and P10 as the dead-end
cross-linking products of VLTTGLPALISWIK21R
(modification site: K21) and VFDK94DGNGYISAAELR
(modification site: K94), respectively (see Figure S-5
and discussion in Supporting Information).

From the cross-linking experiment of the calmodulin–melittin
complex with subsequent EC/DESI-MS analysis, four cross-linking products
P7–P10 are identified (structures shown in Figure 5a, inset). The formation of P8–P10 indicates
that the N terminus of melittin (G1) and the K21 of melittin are also solvent accessible. The formation of P7 manifests
that the K23 of melittin and the K94 of calmodulin
are close to each other during the protein–substrate interaction
process (Figure 5b illustrates the 3D structure
of the complex). Therefore, they can be linked by DSP to form an interpeptide
cross-linking product. This conclusion is in line with the literature
reports14,53,65 and also with
the previously reported MS-based chemical cross-linking results in
which sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
and LC separation were used to separate the protein complex digest
before MS analysis of cross-links. In our experiment, no use of SDS-PAGE
and LC separation and no use of chemical reductants contribute to
the fast speed of our EC/DESI-MS method.

Conclusions
This
study suggests a new, effective, and fast approach using electrochemical
MS to analyze chemically cross-linked products resulting from the
cross linking reactions of proteins/protein complexes with electrochemically
reducible cross-linkers such as DSP. The online electrolytic reduction
provides rich information for the structural analysis. First, cross-links
present in the complicated digest mixtures could be quickly identified
based on their large relative intensity decrease. The newly formed
peptides from electrolysis could be related to their cross-linkers,
based on their mass relationships. The electrochemical reduction gives
rise to linear reduced peptides, facilitating the subsequent MS/MS
analysis to provide sequence information and to pinpoint the modification
sites of the cross-links. Furthermore, the electrolytic reduction
takes place in seconds, and the EC/DESI-MS appears to be compatible
with both top-down and bottom-up analyses, which would be of value
for high-throughput proteomics applications. For the future work to
probe 3D structures of protein samples with unknown sequences, the
differentiation of native disulfide bonds with artificial ones introduced
by cross-linking derivatization may be in need, as native disulfide-bond-containing
peptides would also undergo electrolytic reduction. There are several
possible approaches to address this issue. First, there are characteristic
mass tags retained in the cross-links after reduction, which can be
used for the differentiation purpose. In the case of insulin presented
in this paper, there are two B chain peptides generated from electrolysis,
one is intact B chain from reduction of two native disulfide bonds
and the other one is the modified B chain with a reduced DSP tag.
The presence of two B chains with the mass difference of one reduced
dead-end tag identifies the cross-linked B chain, although the B chain
carries two native disulfide bonds in the protein. Second, one could
use a diselenide bond Se–Se to replace the disulfide bond S–S
in the cross-linking reagent. Such a cross-linking reagent will have
characteristic selenium isotopes, which help differentiate cross-link
products from native disulfide-bond-containing peptides. Furthermore,
the diselenide bond is easier to be electrochemically reduced than
disulfide bonds.66 Thus, selective reduction
of cross-links in the presence of native disulfide-bond-containing
peptides is possible. Third, one could use isotope-labeled cross-linking
reagents. If a mixture of DSP and deuterated DSP is used for performing
cross-linking reactions,67 each cross-link
will have dual peaks, which makes it distinct from native disulfide-bond-containing
peptides. Such investigations are under the way.
