LC–MS
provides a promising alternative to ligand-binding
assays for quantification of therapeutic proteins and biomarkers.
As LC–MS methodology is based on the analysis of proteolytic
peptides, calibration approaches utilizing various calibrators and
internal standards (I.S.) have been developed. A comprehensive assessment
of the accuracy and reliability of these approaches is essential but
has yet been reported. Here we performed a well-controlled and systematic
comparative study using quantification of monoclonal-antibody in plasma
as the model system. Method development utilized a high-throughput
orthogonal-array-optimization, and two sensitive and stable signature-peptides
(SP) from different domains were selected based on extensive evaluations
in plasma matrix. With the purities of all protein/peptide standards
corrected by quantitative amino acid analysis (AAA), five calibration
approaches using stable-isotope-labeled (SIL) I.S. were thoroughly
compared, including those at peptide, extended-peptide, and protein
levels and two “hybrid” approaches (i.e., protein calibrator
with SIL-peptide or SIL-extended-peptide I.S.). These approaches were
further evaluated in parallel for a 15 time point, preclinical pharmacokinetic
study. All methods showed good precision (CV% < 20%). When examined
with protein-spiked plasma QC, peptide-level calibration exhibited
severe negative biases (−23 to −62%), highly discordant
results between the two SP (deviations of 38–56%), and misleading
pharmacokinetics assessments. Extended-peptide calibration showed
significant improvements but still with unacceptable accuracy. Conversely,
protein-level and the two hybrid calibrations achieved good quantitative
accuracy (error < 10%), concordant results by two SP (deviations
< 15%), and correct pharmacokinetic parameters. Hybrid approaches
were found to provide a cost-effective means for accurate quantification
without the costly SIL-protein. Other key findings include (i) using
two SP provides a versatile gauge for method reliability; (ii) evaluation
of peptide stability in the matrix before SP selection is critical;
and (iii) using AAA to verify purities of protein/peptide calibrators
ensures accurate quantitation. These results address fundamental calibration
issues that have not been adequately investigated in published studies
and will provide valuable guidelines for the “fit for purpose”
development of accurate LC–MS assays for therapeutic proteins
and biomarkers in biological matrices.

==== Body
Therapeutic
proteins, and in
particular monoclonal antibodies (mAb), have recently gained enormous
success due to their high specificity, efficacy, and lower risks of
immunogenicity.1−5 These agents exhibit desired pharmacological characteristics such
as long serum half-lives, high potency, and limited off-target toxicity.6,7 However, protein drugs show more complex pharmacokinetic (PK) behaviors
than small-molecule drugs.6,7 Studying the pharmacokinetics
of therapeutic proteins requires highly accurate quantification methods
that enable the correct estimation of drug concentrations in plasma.6,8 Conventionally, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) is utilized
for this purpose owing to its high sensitivity and analytical throughput.
However, ELISA methods are often matrix- and species-dependent, and
the method development is often time-consuming and costly, which is
especially problematic in the early phases of drug discovery and development.9,10 By comparison, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC–MS)
using selected reactions monitoring (SRM) is often matrix- and species-independent,
and method development is generally faster than that for ELISA; moreover,
LC–MS assays can be readily multiplexed, providing multiple
potential advantages versus ELISA11−14

Most LC–MS-based
methods quantify protein by measuring a
selected proteolytic signature peptide (SP) that serves as a surrogate
for the intact protein. For this reason, several different calibration
approaches exist at the peptide,15,16 extended-peptide,17,18 and protein levels.8,19 The choice of calibrators and
stable-isotope-labeled (SIL) internal standards (I.S.) is among the
most critical factors governing the reliability and accuracy of the
LC–MS-based quantification.17,20−22

Peptide-level calibration is the most widely practiced approach,
which employs one synthesized SP as the calibrator and a SIL-analog
of the SP as the I.S. (spiked after digestion).16,23 This approach enables a straightforward and facile development of
quantitative methods, and both the calibrators and SIL-I.S. are readily
available from commercial sources. Nevertheless, the use of an SIL-peptide
as I.S. only corrects variations caused by LC–MS analysis but
not the upstream steps such as sample preparation and digestion (Figure 1A).21 Moreover, owing
to the use of a peptide calibrator, this approach actually derives
protein concentrations based on the measured SP concentrations in
the digest, with the assumption that the efficiencies of sample preparation
and digestion are close to 100%, which may not be true.24 For example, tryptic digestion is rarely complete
and can be partially nonspecific.25 Consequently,
this approach may result in significant bias that is not readily perceivable
when the method is validated by spiking synthesized peptides into
matrix digests, a prevalent practice for peptide-level calibration.
Our lab and others have observed that for a wide variety of proteins,
peptide-level calibration approaches resulted in significant quantitative
bias when examined with protein-spiked QC samples.15,19,24,26,27 Furthermore, when two unique SP were selected for
the quantification of one protein, the peptide-level calibration approach
may give two sets of highly discordant results for the same protein.21,24,26

Figure 1 Illustrations of various calibration approaches
for targeted protein
quantification and the study design of the comparative study. (A)
The three options of internal standard (I.S.) methods used for targeted
protein quantification. Full length stable-isotope-labeled (SIL) protein
I.S. is added to the sample before any preparation; SIL-extended-peptide
I.S. is added right before digestion, and SIL-peptide I.S. is spiked
into the digest mixture after digestion. (B) Scheme of the comparison.
The peptide- and extended-peptide-level calibrations and two hybrid
calibrations were compared against the protein-level calibration (the
Gold Standard), for quantitative performances in both protein-spiked
QC samples and a full rat PK study. (C) The calibrators and I.S. employed
for each calibration approach for quantification of the anti-HCV mAb
in plasma. For each calibration approach, two sets of calibration
curves (one for each SP) were independently established and then used
for quantification.

More recently, extended-peptide
calibration approaches were introduced
to address concerns related to digestion efficiency. The calibrator
consists of a synthesized extended-peptide containing the SP sequence
and (typically) 3–6 flanking residues extended from both the
N- and C-termini. A SIL-extended-peptide is used as the I.S., which
is spiked prior to digestion.12,18,28,29 With cleavable sites at both
ends of the SP sequence, this approach may help to compensate for
the bias and variation introduced in the digestion step (e.g., missed
cleavage and peptide degradation12). For
example, Neubert et al. recently demonstrated that the extended-peptide
calibration approach enabled accurate and sensitive quantification
of small protein biomarkers, such as nerve growth factors, in plasma.18 Artificial QconCAT proteins that contain multiple
extended-peptides have been engineered to enable multiplexed quantification
of a large number of targets.30

The
protein-level calibration method employs full-length protein
as the calibrator and full-length SIL-protein as I.S., which is spiked
directly into samples before sample preparation. This method provides
high accuracy and precision by correcting the system bias and variation
introduced by any of the sample preparation and enzymatic digestions
steps19,21−23 and, therefore, is considered
the “Gold Standard” for LC–MS-based targeted
protein quantification.31−33 However, a drawback of protein-level
calibration is that the production of full-length SIL-protein with
high isotope purity can be costly and time-consuming23 and is impractical for many classes of proteins.

A systematic, comparative evaluation of the accuracy and precision
of these calibration approaches in biological/pharmaceutical matrices
will provide valuable information for therapeutic protein quantification.
To our knowledge, such an investigation has not been conducted previously.
In this study, we comprehensively compared the quantitative performance
of five internal-standard calibration approaches, including the three
above-mentioned calibration approaches (peptide-calibrator/SIL-peptide-I.S.,
extended-peptide-calibrator/SIL-extended-peptide-I.S., and protein-calibrator/SIL-protein-I.S.)
and two “hybrid” approaches (protein-calibrator/SIL-peptide-I.S.
and protein-calibrator/SIL-extended-protein-I.S.). Quantification
of a mAb in plasma was used as the model system (illustrated in Figure 1). SP candidates were experimentally discovered,
and the most sensitive and stable SP were selected based on evaluations
in plasma digest. Two unique SP from different domains of the mAb
were chosen to serve as a gauge for quantitative reliability. To avoid
possible bias arising from differing purities of calibration standards,
the purities of all protein, peptide, and extended-peptide standards
were accurately measured by quantitative amino acid analysis (AAA).
The accuracy and precision of each approach were assessed using QC
samples prepared by spiking pure protein into plasma. Finally, we
compared the five calibration approaches in a full pharmacokinetic
assessment using a rat model.

Experimental Procedure
Materials and Reagents
A chimeric anti-Hepatitis C
virus antibody (HCV-mAb, ∼170 kD) and its full-length stable-isotope-labeled
(SIL) cognate were obtained from AbbVie (formerly Abbott Laboratories,
North Chicago, IL). Sequencing-grade trypsin was from Promega (Madison
WI). Protease, phosphatase, and kinase inhibitor cocktail tablets
were from Roche (Basel, Switzerland). Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein
assay reagents were from Pierce (Rockford, IL). HPLC-grade methanol,
acetonitrile, acetone, and water were from B&J (Muskegon, MI).
LC–MS-grade formic acid was from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland).
Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP), Tris, iodoacetamide (IAA),
and phosphate-buffered saline were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO). Signature peptides, extended signature peptides,
their isotope-labeled cognates {i.e., GPSVFPLAPSSK[15N,13C] (the GPS
peptide), TVAAPSVFIFPPSDEQLK[15N,13C] (the TVA peptide), ASTKGPSVFPLAPSSK[15N,13C]STSG
(the extended GPS peptide), and EIKRTVAAPSVFIFPPSDEQLK[15N,13C]SGTA
(the extended TVA peptide)}, and their nonlabeled versions were synthesized
by New England Peptide (Gardner, MA) with nominal purity >95%.
The
peptide and extended-peptide stock solutions were prepared in 50%
acetonitrile. The actual purities of all standards were calibrated
using values measured accurately by quantitative amino acid analysis
(AAA). Isotopic purities for synthesized peptide and extended-peptide
SIL-standards were >99.9% and ∼97% (for lysine residues)
for
the SIL-protein produced by SILAC.

Identification of Signature
Peptides (SP) via an Experimental
Strategy and Development of the LC–MS Method
In this
study, the optimal SP were identified using an experimental strategy,
which included (i) the discovery of SP candidates by LC-Orbitrap MS
analysis; (ii) a high-throughput, on-the-fly orthogonal array optimization
to optimize SRM conditions for all candidates in plasma digest, and
(iii) selection of two stable and sensitive SP based on the thorough
evaluation in the plasma matrix. Details are in the Supporting Information.

Preparation of Plasma Samples
The rat plasma samples
were subjected to protein denaturing, reduction/alkylation, and then
a precipitation/on-pellet-digestion procedure that provides an efficient
sample cleanup and optimal peptide recovery.26,27,34 An aliquot of 2 μL of rat plasma sample
was diluted 20-fold by PBS (100 mM, pH7.4) containing 0.5% SDS. Proteins
in the diluted sample was reduced by TCEP (2 mM) for 15 min at 37
°C and then alkylated with IAA (100 mM) at 37 °C for 30
min. Both steps were performed under darkness with agitation. The
protein content was precipitated in two steps, by adding 1 vol of
chilled acetone at −20 °C and vortexing for 1 min to generate
fine-sized protein aggregates, followed by adding 5 vol of chilled
acetone. The samples were centrifuged at 20000g for
30 min, and the supernatant was removed carefully and the protein
pellet was allowed to air-dry. Tris buffer (50 mM, pH 8.2) containing
trypsin was added to a final E/S ratio of 1:20 (w/w). The solution
was then incubated at 37 °C and vortexed at 500 rpm for 6 h to
dissolve the pellet. A second aliquot of trypsin was added at an E/S
ratio of 1:15 (w/w), and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C overnight
to achieve complete digestion. Formic acid was added to a final concentration
of 1% (v/v) to terminate the digestion. The sample was then centrifuged
at (20000g) at 4 °C for 30 min, and 2/3 of the
supernatant was transferred to the autosampler vial for LC–MS
analysis.

LC–SRM–MS Analysis
Quantitative analysis
was performed on a microflow-LC system coupled to a triple-quadruple
MS.35 An Agillent 1100 capillary HPLC was
interfaced to a Thermo Scientific Quantum Ultra EMR triple-quadruple
mass spectrometer via an ESI source (San Jose, CA). The separation
was performed on a Zorbax-SB-C18 Stablebond column (150 mm ×
0.5 mm i.d., 3.5 μm, and 100 Å pore size). A 20 min gradient
was employed with a 10 μL injection volume, and the flow rate
was 15 μL/min. A and B solvents were mixtures of water:acetonitrile:formic
acid at 98:2:0.1 and 15:85:0.1, respectively. The gradient was 80%
A to 72.5% A in 3 min and 55% A in 9 min, and then 100% B for 3 min
followed by column equilibration at 80% A for 5 min. The column temperature
was 50 °C. The spray voltage was 3.5 kV, and the capillary temperature
was 320 °C. Quantification was performed using selected reaction
monitoring of the transitions m/z 593.8→699.5 for GPS and m/z 973.8→913.4 for TVA. The optimized collision energy and tube-lens
voltages were set at 21 eV/100 V and 29 eV/120 V based on the conditions
obtained by orthogonal array optimization (OAO). Additional transitions
(e.g., m/z 593.8→846.4 and m/z 973.8→1060.0 for GPS and TVA,
respectively) were monitored to confirm the accurate assignment of
the chromatography peaks. I.S. peptides were monitored using transitions
of m/z 597.8→707.4 and m/z 977.8→ 921.2 for GPS and TVA,
respectively. The dwell time was 100 ms for each transition. Q1 and
Q3 resolution were both set at 0.7 fwhm (full width at half-maximum).
The selected reaction monitoring data was processed by LCquan from
Thermo Scientific. The signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) were determined
as the intensity of the ion-current peak signals of target peptides
over the baseline chemical noises. The lower limit of quantification,
LLOQ, was determined as at least three folds of the lower limit-of-detection
(LOD) of the least sensitive signature peptide of the same protein.

Establishment of the Five Calibration Approaches
The
five different calibration approaches (Figure 1B) were prepared across the protein concentration range of 0.1–200
μg/mL (or equal molar concentrations of peptides or extended
peptides). The actual purities of all standards were accurately quantified
by quantitative amino acid analysis (AAA). Each calibration method
was prepared following its own procedure (c.f. Figure 1, panels A and C). For each calibration approach, two calibration
curves were prepared independently for the two SP. For each SP, the
calibration curve was constructed by plotting the peak area ratios
of the SP and I.S. versus the corresponding mAb concentrations. Linear
regression with a 1/x2 weighting factor
was employed. The procedures for preparing the calibration solutions
are specified below.

Protein-Level Calibration
The protein-level
calibration
solutions were prepared by spiking 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 5, 20, 40, and
200 μg/mL pure mAb (purity was calibrated by AAA, same below)
in pooled blank rat plasma before any preparation procedure; meanwhile,
full-length SIL-HCV mAb was spiked at the concentration of 500 ng/mL.
All calibration samples were experimentally processed and analyzed
by LC-SRM-MS, following the above-mentioned protocols.

Peptide-Level
Calibration
Peptide-level calibration
solutions were prepared with adding GPS peptide at 0.032, 0.064, 0.16,
0.32, 1.6, 6.4, 12.8, and 64 ng/mL and TVA peptide at 0.052, 0.104,
0.26, 0.52, 2.6, 10.4, 20.8, and 104 ng/mL into digested rat plasma,
which had been diluted 50-fold from the original plasma sample before
the digestion procedure (c.f. the preparation procedure). The above
concentration ranges correspond to the same molarities of 0.1–200
μg/mL mAb protein in plasma. The levels of SIL-GPS and TVA I.S.
were 2.00 and 3.25 ng/mL, respectively.

Extended-Peptide Level
Calibration
Standard solutions
were prepared by spiking 0.052, 0.104, 0.26, 0.52, 2.6, 10.4, 20.8,
and 104 ng/mL extended-GPS peptide and 0.076, 0.152, 0.376, 0.752,
3.75, 15, 30, and 150 ng/mL extended-TVA-peptide to the diluted and
prepared plasma before digestion. These concentration ranges correspond
to the same molarities of 0.1–200 μg/mL mAb protein in
plasma. The I.S., SIL-extended-GPS, and SIL-extended-TVA were added
at 3.25 and 4.68 ng/mL, respectively.

Hybrid Calibrations
Two varieties of hybrid calibrations
were investigated. For both of the hybrid calibration approaches,
the protein calibrator was spiked at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 5, 20, 40,
and 200 μg/mL HCV mAb antibody to blank rat plasma before any
preparation step, which is the same as the protein-level calibration
approach. For the hybrid approach using SIL-extended-peptide I.S.,
the SIL-extended-peptide I.S. was added at the same levels as that
of the extended-peptide-level calibration approach, after sample preparation
but before digestion; for the hybrid approach using SIL-peptide I.S.,
the protein-spiked plasma samples were prepared and digested, and
then the SIL-peptide I.S. was added after digestion at the same levels
as that of the peptide-level calibration approach.

Validation
and Evaluation of Quantitative Performance Using
Protein-Spiked QC Samples
The five calibration approaches
were individually validated using the “default” method
for each [i.e., spiking blank plasma samples (or sample digest) with
the corresponding calibrators (peptides, extended-peptides or protein)
of each calibration approach]. Details are shown in the Supporting Information. In order to evaluate
the real accuracy of these approaches for the quantification of protein
in plasma, another batch of QC samples were prepared by spiking the
AAA-certified anti-HCV-mAb (full-length protein) into blank rat plasma
at three levels (1.6, 10, and 80 μg/mL). Aliquots of these QC
samples were prepared and analyzed by every calibration approach in
triplicate for each of two different days (day 1 and day 14, N = 6). For each sample and each calibration approach, two
sets of quantitative results were independently obtained by the two
SP, and the agreement between the two values was evaluated.

Comparison
of the Five Approaches in a Full Preclinical PK Study
Animal
protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of the SUNY-Buffalo. Male Sprague–Dawley
rats were given a single intravenous dose of 2 mg/kg of the mAb (N = 4), and 50 μL of blood was collected at each of
the 15 time points after administration (i.e., 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24,
48, 72, 120, 168, 216, 264, 360, 504, and 648 h). The plasma was procured,
and after vortexing, five 2 μL aliquots of the same plasma sample
were taken, which were quantified with each of the five different
calibration methods. Two sets of quantitative values were independently
obtained using the two SP. On the basis of the time–concentration
curves obtained by these calibration approaches, the PK parameters
were assessed with use of WinNonlin (Pharsight Corporation, Palo Alto,
CA).

Results and Discussion
Selection of Two SP and Development of the
LC–MS Method
In order to conduct an unbiased comparison
of the calibration approaches,
it is important to select the optimal SP that are stable, sensitive,
and specific to the target protein (anti-HCV mAb, sequence shown in
Figure 1 of the Supporting Information).
To achieve this goal, instead of using an in silico method to predict
the optimal SP, we employed an experimental strategy to discover and
optimize many SP candidates, and then to evaluate these candidates
in target matrices prior to SP selection.24,26,27 Briefly, the pool of SP candidates was generated
by a data-dependent nano-LC-LTQ/Orbitrap analysis and a stringent
filtering step.26,27 The list of qualified SP candidates
is shown in Table 1 of the Supporting Information. To evaluate these candidates, the anti-HCV mAb was spiked to blank
plasma and then the samples were prepared and digested; the optimal
LC–MS conditions of all SP candidates shown in Table 1 of the Supporting Information were accurately obtained
by a high-throughput and on-the-fly orthogonal-array-optimization
(OAO)24,26,27 within one
single LC–MS run. With the use of the developed LC–MS
conditions, all candidates were thoroughly assessed for stability
and signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) in the plasma digest.

Selection
of unstable peptides as SP carries a significant risk of quantitative
bias/variation, which cannot be corrected by SIL-peptide I.S.24,26,36 For this reason, we evaluated
the stability of the 15 candidates (Table 1 of the Supporting Information) by continuous incubation of the digest
mixture under conditions respectively mimicking tryptic digestion
(37 °C, pH 8.5, 24 h) and queuing in a cooled autosampler (4
°C, pH 2.8, 48 h). Details are presented in the Experimental
section of the Supporting Information.
Interestingly, 5 out of the 15 SP candidates showed considerable
degradation (>20%) in at least one of the conditions, and some
of
these unstable peptides were of high abundance (Figure 2 and Table 1 of the Supporting Information). These observations underscore the potential risks of selecting
SP merely based on the signal intensity. Among the stable peptides,
two unique SP showing the highest S/N from heavy chain (GPSVFPLAPSSK,
referred as the GPS peptide) and light chain (TVAAPSVFIFPPSDEQLK,
the TVA peptide) were selected. The SP and their extended peptides
(ASTKGPSVFPLAPSSKSTSG and EIKRTVAAPSVFIFPPSDEQLKSGTA)
are synthesized in both isotope labeled and nonlabeled forms.

Figure 2 Evaluation
of the stability of the 15 candidates for signature
peptides (SP) from the anti-HCV mAb, by continuous incubation of the
digest mixture under conditions mimicking (A) prolonged tryptic digestion
(37 °C, pH 8.5, 24 h) and (B) queuing in a cooled autosampler
(4 °C, pH 2.8, 48 h), respectively. The peptides are represented
by the first three residues of their sequence (the full list is in
Table 1 of the Supporting Information).
GPS and TVA peptides from the heavy and light chains of the mAb, respectively,
were finally selected as the SP (shown in red and blue).

To enable an unbiased comparison of the five calibration
approaches,
the purities of all peptide, extended-peptide, and protein calibrators
were quantified by the AAA and the mean quantitative values were corroborated
for every amino acid residue to ensure accuracy. The results are shown
in Table 2 of the Supporting Information. Clearly, the actual purities of all standards were markedly lower
than the nominal values. For example, though the manufacturer-labeled
purity for the TVA peptide was >95%, the true purity was only 65%.
Manufacturers use HPLC-UV or electrophoresis methods to determine
protein/peptide purities, which are unable to detect nonresponsive
contaminations (e.g., dried buffer salts) and thus may result in a
positive bias. As the standards were produced by highly reputable
providers, such biases may be prevalent and thereby performing AAA
to verify calibration standards is advisable to ensure quantitative
accuracy.

Plasma samples were subjected to precipitation and
overnight digestion,
a procedure demonstrated to afford high peptide recovery, high reproducibility,
and excellent digestion efficiency,24,27,34,37 followed by LC–MS
analysis. Typical chromatograms of the two SP in plasma digest are
shown in Figure 2 of the Supporting Information. Good selectivity was achieved for both SP. The detection limits
were 15 and 30 ng of mAb protein per mL of plasma for GPS and TVA
peptides, respectively. In this study, the lower limits of quantification
(LLOQ) for both SP were validated at 100 ng protein per milliliters
of plasma.

Comparison of the Five Calibration Approaches
with Spiked QC
Samples
Calibration Approaches at Peptide, Extended-Peptide, and Protein
Levels
To ensure an objective comparison, the calibration
curves at the peptide, extended-peptide, and protein levels were prepared
in the same protein concentration range of 0.1–200 μg/mL
in plasma (or equal molarities of peptides/extended-peptides, the
same as below). For every
approach, two calibration curves were independently prepared for the
two SP. All calibration curves showed excellent linearity (R2 ≥ 0.99, Table 3 of the Supporting Information). Then we validated these
calibration approaches using QC samples spiked with their corresponding
calibrators (e.g. spiking pure synthesized peptides to digested blank
plasma for peptide calibration), extended-peptides right before digestion
for extended-peptide calibration, and pure protein before sample preparation
for protein calibration. With the use of these “by default”
validation approaches that have been widely practiced,16 all methods exhibited excellent accuracy and
precision at the three QC levels, as shown in Table 3 of the Supporting Information. However, the validation
practices used for peptide and extended-peptide calibrations may not
correctly reflect the accuracy of protein quantification because the
target analyte is the protein rather than a peptide or extended-peptide.

Subsequently, we sought to evaluate the quantitative performance
of these three calibration approaches using QC prepared by spiking
AAA-certified full-length protein into blank plasma at three levels
(1.6, 10, and 80 μg/mL). The results are illustrated in Figure 3A, which plots the quantitative biases by the two
SP (on the x- and y-axis) in replicate
measurements (N = 6 in two different days). Detailed
quantitative data is shown in Table 4 of the Supporting
Information. All methods showed excellent precision. However,
the peptide-level calibration clearly resulted in severe negative
bias with both SP (Figure 3A); moreover, the
quantitative values by the two SP differed substantially (Figure 3A and Table 4 of the Supporting
Information). These problems may arise from the incomplete
peptide recoveries in the preparation and digestion steps, and that
the recoveries for the two SP may be substantially different. Incomplete
recovery of SP appears to be inevitable, even if thoroughly optimized
preparation and digestion strategies were employed.15,19,20,24,26,31 The use of the extended-peptide
calibration approach was found to markedly reduce the quantitative
biases and discrepancy between the two SP (Figure 3A), probably because the incomplete peptide recovery during
digestion was at least partially compensated for.12,18,38 Nevertheless, that accuracy achieved by
extended-peptide calibration is still insufficient (Figure 3A). Previously Neubert et al. demonstrated that
extended-peptide calibration achieved excellent quantitative accuracy
for a small cytokine protein.18 We speculate
that the different observations between the two studies may reflect
that the extended-peptide could well-resemble the digestion behavior
of the SP domain in small proteins, but not so in a much larger protein
such as a mAb.39,40

Figure 3 Two-dimensional representations of the
quantitative biases by (A)
peptide-, extended-peptide-, and protein-level calibration approaches
and (B) the two “hybrid” calibration approaches (c.f.,
Figure 1). QC samples were prepared by spiking
blank plasma with pure protein at three levels: 1.6, 10, and 80 μg/mL.
The purities of all standards were accurately measured by the quantitative
amino acid analysis method to eliminate bias arising from possible
inaccurate purity. Five aliquots of each QC sample were individually
prepared and analyzed in replicates by the five calibration approaches.
Each sample was analyzed three times in each of two different days
(day 1 and day 14, N = 6, shown as individual data
points). For every calibration method, the quantitative values were
obtained independently using the two signature peptides (SP) (i.e.,
the GPS and TVA peptides). The two axes represent the quantitative

the zone of <20% bias, while the golden box signifies the zone

Protein-level calibration
utilizing full-length protein as calibrator
and full-length SIL-protein as I.S. has demonstrated excellent quantitative
performance regardless of the efficiencies of the preparation and
digestion procedures,19,21,23 and therefore can be used as the “Gold Standard” for
targeted protein quantification. Consistent with this notion, in this
study, excellent accuracy and precision were observed at all QC levels
by the protein-level calibration (Figure 3A).
Though protein-level calibration provides high accuracy and precision,
SIL-proteins must be produced in high-yields to be cost-effective,
limiting their production to those for which optimized cell lines
have been developed.20 Additionally, since
these proteins are generally produced by the SILAC method,41 achieving very high isotopic purity is often
both technically challenging and cost prohibitive. In this study,
a 97% isotope purity (i.e., 3% of the mAb molecules is not labeled)
was obtained for the SIL-anti-HCV mAb following multiple cycles of
metabolic labeling, in comparison with >99.9% isotopic purities
that
are typically seen in synthesized SIL-peptides. To avoid sample contamination
by the I.S., the SIL-protein has to be spiked at a relatively low
level (<30-fold of detect limit in this study) and thus may limit
the flexibility of method development. Typical chromatograms illustrating
this problem are shown in Figure 3 of the Supporting
Information.

Hybrid Calibration Approaches
To
achieve accurate quantification,
one plausible alternative to the protein-level calibration is the
“hybrid” calibration methods (i.e., employing the full-length
protein as calibrator and SIL-peptide or SIL-extended peptide as I.S.).
When reproducible preparation and digestion steps are achieved, the
use of full-length proteins as calibrator will offset the peptide
losses in these steps even without using SIL-protein I.S. and, therefore,
may result in accurate protein quantification. Our previous works
as well as these by others showed accurate quantification of liver
enzymes and mAb, using protein calibrator and SIL-peptide I.S.12,24,26,27,42 Here we evaluated the quantitative performance
of two hybrid calibration methods: protein-calibrator with SIL-peptide
I.S. and protein-calibrator with SIL-extended-peptide-I.S., using
QC prepared by spiking blank plasma with pure protein. Excellent quantitative
accuracy and precision were observed for both methods at the three
protein levels (N = 6, Figure 3B and Table 4 of the Supporting Information). The high level of accuracy and precision also suggested high reproducibility
of the preparation and digestion procedure used in this study. These
results demonstrated that hybrid approaches have a good potential
for accurate targeted quantification in the absence of SIL-protein.

Comprehensive Comparison of Calibration Approaches in a Full
Pharmacokinetics Study in Rats
The above comparisons were
carried out in blank plasma spiked with known amounts of pure protein.
In order to examine whether the above observations hold true for “real-world”
applications, we further compared the five calibration approaches
in parallel for a full pharmacokinetics analysis. Four rats (N = 4) received a single, clinically relevant dose of mAb
(2.0 mg/kg), and then plasma samples were collected at 15 time points
ranging from 0.5 to 648 h post injection (see Experimental
Section). Five 2 μL aliquots of each sample were taken
out, and then each aliquot was prepared and analyzed by one of the
five calibration approaches. The time courses measured by these approaches
are shown in Figure 4 (panels A–E).
Protein-level calibration was utilized as the gold standard to estimate
the range of true protein concentrations in the time-course samples
(Figure 4A) and to define the acceptable error
zone (±15%, as indicated by the gray bands in Figure 4 (panels A–F). As a cross validation, results
by a parallel ELISA quantification also fell well within this zone
(Figure 4F). Consistent with the findings in
protein-spiked QC samples, the peptide-level calibration resulted
in substantially underestimated concentrations in all time-course
samples; moreover, for the same set of plasma samples, quantification
independently by the two SP resulted in two substantially different
sets of concentration–time curves (Figure 4B). Extended-peptide calibration approach showed a significant
improvement over the peptide-level calibration (Figure 4C); however, considerable underestimation was still observed
and most of the data points are not in the acceptable range; furthermore,
the results by the two SP also differed markedly (Figure 4C). In contrast, both of the hybrid calibration
methods afforded accurate measurement in all time-course samples (i.e.,
all data points are within the acceptable zone, Figure 4, panels D–E), and the results by the two SP agreed
well with each other. Time course data at each time points are shown
in Table 5 of the Supporting Information. The extents of inconsistency between the two SP in the time course
samples are summarized in Figure 5. For protein-level
and hybrid calibration approaches, excellent agreements between the
SP were observed (deviation <15%), which is in sharp contrast to
peptide- and extended-peptide-level calibration methods, where the
deviations were >15% in a vast majority of the samples. These observations
highlight the benefits of using multiple SP as a gauge for reliability
of the quantitative method and results.

Figure 4 Comparison of the five
calibration approaches and ELISA for a full
PK study in rats. The time courses of anti-HCV mAb were measured by
the five approaches in parallel: (A) protein-level calibration, (B)
peptide-level calibration, (C) extended-peptide-level calibration,
and two “hybrid approaches” employing protein as a calibrator
with (D) SIL-peptides or (E) SIL-extended-peptides as I.S. (F) The
results of a parallel ligand binding assay (samples from the four
animals were pooled at each time point). PK parameters calculated
based on the time courses determined by each calibration approach
are shown in (G). Rats (N = 4) were given a single
dose (I.V., 2 mg/kg) of anti-HCV mAb, and blood samples were collected
at 15 time points post injection. Five aliquots of each sample were
individually prepared and analyzed, respectively, by the five calibration
approaches. Quantitative data were obtained independently by the two
SP. The ±15% error zones were estimated based on the mean values
obtained by the protein-level calibration approach (the Gold Standard).

Figure 5 The extent of inconsistency between the two
SP in the time course
samples. The deviation between quantitative results obtained by the
two signature peptides was used as a gauge for the reliability of
the quantification method. For each of the calibration approaches,
the average deviation of samples within the same time point group
was calculated (N = 4 per time point). The threshold
of acceptance was deviation < 15% (red line) between the two SP.

Finally, to assess the effects
of calibration approaches on pharmacokinetics
assessment, we calculated some basic pharmacokinetic parameters based
on the time course data (Figure 4G and Table 1). The values measured by the protein-level calibration
defined the threshold of correct estimation (±15%, Figure 4G). Both the peptide- and extended-peptide level
calibrations severely overestimated the steady state volume of distribution
(Vss) and clearance (Cl) of the mAb and underestimated the AUC, while
the half-life values (T1/2) were correct
because this parameter is not dependent on the absolute level of drug;
additionally, two discordant sets of PK parameters were obtained by
the two SP (Table 1). Per contra, the hybrid
methods achieved correct estimation of all parameters by both SP (Table 1). Interestingly, the PK parameters estimated by
the two SP are more concordant using the hybrid approach with SIL-peptide
I.S. (hybrid#1), than using SIL-extended-peptide I.S. (hybrid#2).
This observation probably rooted from the possible different digestion
rates between the extended-peptides and the corresponding domains
in the protein.

Conclusions
In
biomedical/pharmaceutical research and industry, accurate measurement
of protein, drug, or biomarker in biological matrices is often critical.
To facilitate the development of accurate LC–MS-based methods,
we systematically evaluated the quantitative accuracy achieved by
various calibration approaches. For each approach, the target mAb
protein was independently quantified by two SP that were stringently
selected based on a thorough evaluation of all candidates for stability
and sensitivity. Under the sample preparation, digestion, and LC–MS
methods developed here, all calibration approaches exhibited excellent
quantitative precision.

Though peptide-level calibration achieved
excellent accuracy when
validated with peptide-spiked QC (the “default” method
for validation of peptide-level calibration), severe negative bias,
and discordant results by the two SP were observed when this approach
was examined with protein-spiked QC, suggesting that reliance on peptide
calibration may carry a “hidden” but significant risk
of quantitative error. Extended-peptide calibration showed noticeable
improvement but negative biases remained, probably reflecting the
fact that a short extended-peptide may not resemble the behavior of
a large protein such as the mAb. Conversely, good quantitative accuracy
was observed for the three approaches using full-length protein as
the calibrator, including the protein-level calibration (the gold
standard) and two hybrid approaches. While the protein-level calibration
requires full-length SIL-protein which is expensive and may have isotope
purity issues, the hybrid methods circumvent this need by employing
SIL-peptide or SIL-extended-peptide as I.S. without perceivably compromising
quantitative accuracy. Therefore, when reproducible sample preparation
is achieved, the hybrid methods may provide a cost-effective alternative
to protein-level calibration for accurate quantification.

This
study also demonstrated that the peptide- and extended-peptide
level calibration approaches may result in misleading biological/pharmaceutical
information, such as the incorrect pharmacokinetic assessments observed
in the thorough pharmacokinetic study. Again the hybrid calibration
approaches resulted in accurate pharmacokinetic assessments. This
work also underscored the benefits of using two SP from different
domains of a protein to gauge the reliability of quantification, which
is capable of perceiving quantitative errors arising from such factors
as methodological bias and truncation or modification of the target
protein. Also highlighted in this study are the importance of using
AAA-certified standards for accurate absolute quantification and the
necessity of evaluating peptide stabilities prior to the selection
of SP, two issues that are often overlooked.

This study addressed
important calibration issues in the developing
field of LC–MS-based protein quantification, which has not
been adequately addressed in published studies. The observations from
this study should be of considerable value for practitioners as they
develop “fit for purpose” quantitative assays. Preclinical
and clinical PK studies require accurate quantification of therapeutic
proteins and biomarkers. However, while the peptide-level calibration
approach may not accurately reveal absolute protein concentrations
in biological matrices, it is straightforward to develop at low cost
and high throughput and will perform well for relative quantification;
for example, it is an excellent and powerful tool for early estimation
of T1/2 or multiplexed evaluation of protein
biomarkers in preclinical species.13
