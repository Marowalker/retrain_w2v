Integration of multiomics
data remains a key challenge in fulfilling
the potential of comprehensive systems biology. Multiple-block orthogonal
projections to latent structures (OnPLS) is a projection method that
simultaneously models multiple data matrices, reducing feature space
without relying on a priori biological knowledge. In order to improve
the interpretability of OnPLS models, the associated multi-block variable
influence on orthogonal projections (MB-VIOP) method is used to identify
variables with the highest contribution to the model. This study combined
OnPLS and MB-VIOP with interactive visualization methods to interrogate
an exemplar multiomics study, using a subset of 22 individuals from
an asthma cohort. Joint data structure in six data blocks was assessed:
transcriptomics; metabolomics; targeted assays for sphingolipids,
oxylipins, and fatty acids; and a clinical block including lung function,
immune cell differentials, and cytokines. The model identified seven
components, two of which had contributions from all blocks (globally
joint structure) and five that had contributions from two to five
blocks (locally joint structure). Components 1 and 2 were the most
informative, identifying differences between healthy controls and
asthmatics and a disease–sex interaction, respectively. The
interactions between features selected by MB-VIOP were visualized
using chord plots, yielding putative novel insights into asthma disease
pathogenesis, the effects of asthma treatment, and biological roles
of uncharacterized genes. For example, the gene ATP6 V1G1, which has been implicated in osteoporosis, correlated with metabolites
that are dysregulated by inhaled corticoid steroids (ICS), providing
insight into the mechanisms underlying bone density loss in asthma
patients taking ICS. These results show the potential for OnPLS, combined
with MB-VIOP variable selection and interaction visualization techniques,
to generate hypotheses from multiomics studies and inform biology.

==== Body
In the postgenomic era, data-driven
science has become increasingly necessary because of the vast array
of instrumentation that is capable of generating thousands of data
points for a single analytical observation.1,2 In
addition to using classical univariate statistical methods, machine-learning
techniques have become routinely used to interrogate and understand
vast amounts of data.3,4 Two common characteristics of
-omics data are that the number of measured variables is vastly greater
than the number of observations5 and that
there is a degree of multicollinearity between variables.6 As such, computational methods that project high
dimensional data into a smaller number of component variables have
become commonplace.7 Multivariate projection
methods such as principal components analysis (PCA),8 partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA),9 and canonical variate analysis (CVA),8 together with hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA),10 random forests,11 and support vector machines (SVM),12 are
all used to analyze -omics data.3,4 PLS-DA and its extension,
orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA),13,14 have become popular projection methods in the metabolomics community.15 As modeling methods become increasingly complicated,
they have also become concomitantly difficult to interpret. Assignment
of the variable importance often becomes an a posteriori statistical
process based on either permutation testing or random resampling (e.g.,
confidence intervals derived from bootstrap/jackknife statistics).16 For methods based on a PLS algorithm, the direct
statistical method of variable influence on projection (VIP)17,18 is often used to estimate variable contribution to the resulting
models.

In recent years, as the -omics sciences have matured,
it has become
common to acquire data from multiple -omics platforms in a single
biological experiment. As such, each biological sample is interrogated
by multiple analytical platforms, which in turn can be linked to multiple
sources of experimental metadata. Data from each platform (or measurement
context) can be considered a discrete block, with
multiple blocks making up the complete data set of the experiment.
Multivariate projection methods such as OPLS-DA have proven successful
in modeling the underlying latent biological structure within a single
high dimensional data block; however, they are theoretically unsuitable
for modeling multiple data blocks simultaneously. There are two reasons
for this issue. First, if multiple data blocks are concatenated into
a single matrix, with no accounting for measurement context, then
the subsequent model can be considered as a single projection model,
where the weighting of each variable is governed by the total sum
of squares.19 This, in principle, demands
that each block is normalized to the same size, to avoid a projection
model that is biased toward the impact of the data set with the most
variables. In practice, this can be problematic, particularly when
there are a mix of blocks of vastly different sizes. For example,
in a model concatenating 20 000 transcripts, 200 metabolites,
and 20 clinical variables, the transcripts would over-represent the
global data structure and thus have a larger contribution to the resulting
model. In multi-block modeling, this is not an issue, as each block
is treated independently. This approach leaves flexibility to scale
individual variables according to importance and also to keep variables
in their original unit. Second, each individual data set is associated
with its own underlying structure,19,20 describing
the true biological variance and also platform-specific measurement
error. Covariance of biological latent structure across multiple data
blocks is implicit; however, it is a fair assumption that the measurement
error across multiple blocks will be independent and thus easily ignored
at this block-interaction level. Conversely, if multiple data blocks
are concatenated into a single data set before projection, the model
will struggle to effectively separate true biological structure from
block-specific noise and result in erroneous interpretation of the
conglomerate projection model.

To address the need for multivariate
methods to simultaneously
model multiple data matrices, a number of multi-block data integration
methods have been proposed.21−23 In 2011, Löfstedt and
Trygg24 proposed a novel multi-block multivariate
method called OnPLS, which utilizes the framework of OPLS to decompose
data from more than two input matrices. Multi-block models, such as
OnPLS, are fully symmetric, meaning each data block is weighted to
allow an equal contribution to the model, regardless of the number
of variables or underlying data structure within each block.25 Multi-block approaches offer further advantages
over single block or block concatenation in biomarker discovery. First,
the validity of any true biological biomarker is significantly increased
if there is a clear covariance between data blocks, thus reducing
the possibility of false discovery.26 Second,
contrary to block-concatenation modeling, which is strongly biased
toward the globally joint variation, multi-block analysis decomposes
the different levels of variation (global, local, unique)27 such that relatively small but informative trends
are also identified. Recently, Galindo-Prieto et al. adapted the VIP
concept for multi-block data analysis (multi-block variable influence
on orthogonal projections method,28 MB-VIOP)
to identify the variables that contribute to these different levels
of joint structure.

The aim of this study was to combine OnPLS
and MB-VIOP with data
visualization methods to create a workflow capable of simultaneously
modeling and investigating interactions between multiple -omics data
blocks. The study chosen for this purpose was a subset from a previously
reported asthma cohort, for which multiple -omics data sets were acquired
in isolation.29,30 These analyses included untargeted
metabolomics, targeted metabolite assays, differential immune cell
population analyses, and cytokine arrays. Additionally, for the present
study, transcriptomics of peripheral blood T cells was performed.
OnPLS modeling and MB-VIOP were then used to integrate the disparate
data blocks into a single model, which was then interrogated to identify
novel interactions between the data blocks and disease status as well
as other clinical end points.

Experimental Section
Clinical Cohort
Briefly, 12 healthy controls and 10
severe asthmatics were included from the original study.29 Transcriptomics was subsequently performed on
peripheral blood T cells, and metabolomics/metabolic profiling assays
were performed on serum. All participants were enrolled from the NIHR
Southampton Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit and University Hospital
Southampton outpatient clinics; all provided written informed consent.
The National Research Ethics Service Committee South Central—Southampton
B ethics committee (UK; ref 10/H0504/2) approved this study. Clinical
classification and enrollment criteria were previously described.29,31 Participant data were included in the present study if they were
classified as either healthy control or severe asthmatic individuals
in the existing cohort, and data from all data blocks (described in
the next section) were collected.

Sample Collection and Analyses
Details of sample collection
and transcriptomics analyses are available in the Supporting Information. Details of analytics, quality control,
and data cleaning for metabolomics, targeted metabolic assays, and
clinical assays were performed as previously described.29,30

Data Blocks and Processing
Six data blocks were used
for modeling: Transcriptomics, Sphingolipids, Metabolomics, Fatty
Acids, Oxylipins, and Clinical Data (Figure 1). A complete list of all variables included
for each data block is provided in Tables S1–S6. The data blocks were defined by a priori knowledge about both the
system under observation and the measurement technology.19 The primary consideration was that the underlying
structure of the data could possibly confound the biological interaction
between blocks. To avoid bias in combining information from different
probes for one gene, all non-QC probes were included for OnPLS modeling;
the Transcriptomics block included 54 613 variables. This approach
is commonly used for analyzing transcriptomics data.32 Four data blocks represented serum metabolites: Sphingolipids
(28 variables, targeted assay), Metabolomics (66 variables, untargeted
assay screened against an in-house chemical library), Fatty Acids
(14 variables, targeted assay), and Oxylipins (38 variables, targeted
assay). A total of 23 clinical variables were combined into the Clinical
data block; these variables were derived from typical clinical assays
and measurements and included lung function tests, bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid and peripheral blood T cell populations, serum cytokines,
and serum vitamin D3. For clinical data, values that were missing
due to being below the limit of detection (LOD) of the respective
assay were imputed with 1/10 of the lowest measured value, because
the LOD was not known for each assay, and OnPLS cannot process missing
values. Data that were missing for an entire subset array of the clinical
data (e.g., for individuals missing the cytokine assay) were imputed
using the median value of the corresponding clinical group (control
or asthma). Remaining missing values were replaced using PCA imputation.
Prior to OnPLS model calculation, all data (except for transcriptomics)
were log-transformed. All data were then scaled to unit variance.

six data blocks used in this study are shown with their respective
numbers of variables. The diagram shows all possible shared structure
connections between the data blocks.

OnPLS Model Calculation and Visualization
The OnPLS
model simultaneously analyzed the data matrices, returning output
matrices of shared information (components), as described.27 These output matrices reveal shared data structure
on three levels for each data matrix, which can be summarized as

Globally joint components reveal structure that is
shared by all input data matrices. Locally joint components reveal
structure shared by two or more, but not all, of the input matrices.
Finally, unique components identify latent structure that is present
in only one input matrix. The OnPLS model returned separate score
vectors for each data block in each component. To identify the sources
of biological variance explained by the OnPLS components, the component
scores for each block were correlated with metadata variables not
included in the clinical data block: clinical class (control vs asthma),
sex, age, BMI, dose of inhaled and oral corticosteroids, and smoking
(current/former smoker vs never smoked). The resulting Pearson correlation
coefficients were presented as a metadata correlation plot.33 To visualize the overall OnPLS model, hierarchical
principal component analysis (PCA)34 was
used to summarize the 30 OnPLS score vectors, resulting in 2 PCA components
describing the relationships in the OnPLS model. Prior to calculating
the PCA model, the score vectors were scaled to unit variance. The
PCA score plot showed individual participants, and the loadings plot
displayed the score vectors from the OnPLS model, labeled by block
type and OnPLS model component number.

MB-VIOP Concept, Motivation,
and Calculation
Multi-block
variable influence on orthogonal projections (MB-VIOP) is a feature
selection method that (i) sorts the input variables by importance
for data interpretation in OnPLS models, either for the total model
(all variation types together) or per component (global, local, or
unique variations separately), and (ii) explores the connections between
the variables (either in the same or a different data matrix) that
contribute to explain the same component (latent variable) in the
multi-block system. Multi-block-VIOP is a model-based variable selection
method, because it uses the n preprocessed data matrices, the score
vectors, and the normalized loading vectors from an OnPLS model. OnPLS
regression can relate the data matrices according to the model component;
however, it must be emphasized that not all input variables of these
related matrices will connect among themselves to explain the variation
contained in a specific model component. The MB-VIOP algorithm is
necessary to sort the input variables according to their connections
for interpreting the variation contained in one or more specific components.
Furthermore, MB-VIOP finds the degree of importance of each variable
in the correct proportion for a multi-block system, which cannot be
achieved by the OnPLS normalized loadings plot.35

The calculation of the MB-VIOP values can be summarized
as the Hadamard products of the normalized loadings multiplied by
the ratio of the variation explained by a model component and the
cumulated variation. After a block- and component-wise iterative algorithm
with all input variables from the six data matrices involved, the
resulting MB-VIOP vectors were normalized by Euclidean norm and by
the number of original (input) variables raised to the 1/2 power.
The variables of interest that were identified by MB-VIOP were selected
as a subset for further multivariate analysis as shown below. For
additional details about the MB-VIOP fundamentals and algorithm, readers
are referred to the original reference.28

Data Visualization
The between-block covariance of
the subset of variables contributing to Components 1 and 2 of the
OnPLS model were visualized using chord plots.36 Using the variables reaching a defined MB-VIOP threshold,
a chord plot was constructed by first calculating the Spearman rank
correlation coefficient (r) for each pairwise combination
of variables with MB-VIOP values above a threshold. Those variables
where a significant (p < 0.001) between-block
correlation existed were presented as nodes in a circle (grouped by
block), and the correlation represented as a colored arc (yellow being
a positive correlation and purple a negative correlation). The number
of arcs associated with a given node is recorded in parentheses next
to the name of the variable. Each chord plot was constrained such
that within-block correlations were ignored.

Data modeling (OnPLS),
variable selection (MB-VIOP), a posteriori analyses, and creation
of plots were performed using MATLAB 2018a (Mathworks, Natick, MA,
USA). Correlation coefficients for the metadata correlation plots
were calculated using functions from SciPy (http://www.scipy.org/), and the
plot was created using the Matplotlib library.37 SIMCA v15 (Umetrics, Umeå, Sweden) was used to perform
OPLS-DA analysis.

Results and Discussion
Study Population
A total of 22 participants from a
previously described cohort29,30 were included in this
study (12 healthy control individuals and 10 individuals with severe
asthma). Clinical information is presented in Table 1. Age and BMI were significantly higher in
the severe asthmatic group and thus represented confounders in the
study. Furthermore, all individuals in the severe asthmatic group
were treated with inhaled and/or oral corticosteroids (ICS/OCS). Although
the sex ratio and proportion of smokers were also different, they
were not significantly altered between the two groups.

OnPLS Model
The
OnPLS model calculated seven components
that shared joint structure between at least two of the data blocks
(Table 2). Two components
(1 and 4) had globally joint structure, with contributions from all
six blocks. The remaining components had locally joint structure,
with between 2 and 5 data blocks contributing to the joint structure.
The model did not identify any unique components.

The amount of variance explained
in each component, for each data
block, as well as cumulative variance explained by the model is reported
in Table 2. Only 37%
of the total variance in the Transcriptomics data block was explained,
indicating that the majority of the information contained in this
block is not descriptive for describing asthma. This could be due
to the global and unbiased nature of the platform and/or the fact
that the transcriptomics data were derived from the entire peripheral
blood CD3+ T cell population. It would be of more clinical relevance
to target specific cell subpopulations in a single-cell transcriptomics
approach.38 The clinical data described
only 55% of the variance in the Clinical block; however, 16 of the
22 variables were either differential immune cell counts/subpopulation
frequencies or cytokines produced by immune cells. Given the pathophysiological
heterogeneity of asthma, traditional cell population and cytokine
measures alone are insufficient to describe the disease.39

The OnPLS model explained >70% of the
variance in each metabolic
profiling data block (Sphingolipids, Fatty Acids, and Oxylipins) and
56% of the Metabolomics block. This higher degree of explained variance
can be attributed to the selective association between these variables
and asthma. These targeted assays were performed to confirm findings
from the initial metabolomics screen.30 While not all targeted metabolites were originally detected using
metabolomics, they represent biological processes known to be involved
in inflammation. This point is of particular relevance in that it
is not the number of variables in a given data block that is the primary
driver but rather the inherent biological content.4,9 This
facet makes it meaningful to combine disparate -omics blocks of varying
structure into a single OnPLS model and demonstrates the utility of
this approach for data modeling. However, there is the expected caveat
that data blocks that contain higher levels of biological structure
will have a concomitant increase in contribution to the overall OnPLS
model.

To determine the biological factors associated with each
OnPLS
component and data block, model score vectors were correlated with
a number of known biological factors (Figure 2). Component 1 scores from all blocks positively
and significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with disease
status (healthy vs asthma), age, and BMI. All blocks, except Fatty
Acids, positively and significantly (p < 0.05)
correlated with ICS and OCS dose. Transcriptomics, Fatty Acids, and
Clinical scores correlated with smoking status (nonsmoker vs has ever
smoked). As expected, age, BMI, and corticosteroid treatment were
all confounded with disease status (Table 1); thus, explained variation in the model
because of these factors was not distinguished from that of disease.
The Component 2 scores for the Transcriptomics, Oxylipins, and Clinical
blocks significantly (p < 0.05) and positively
correlated with sex. While sex was not a significant confounder in
this study, the distribution between the two classes was different.
This highlights the utility for OnPLS to identify biological sources
for variation in -omics data. The scores for Components 3–6
did not correlate significantly with any of the listed biological
factors and likely describe either a combination of recorded biological
factors or biological factors that were either not observed or not
recorded in this study. As such, this highlights the importance of
strict experimental design measures and extensive record keeping in
data-driven sciences. Despite being a confounder in the study, age
negatively correlated with Component 7 Fatty Acid scores and highlights
the potential for OnPLS to identify underlying biology associated
with data blocks.

correlation (p < 0.05). The amount of variance
that is explained by each data block, in each component, is shown

side of the figure.

PCA of OnPLS Score Vectors
To visualize the entire
OnPLS model, principal components analysis (PCA) was performed on
the scaled OnPLS score vectors (hierarchical PCA, Figure 3). The first principal component
(PC1) showed a separation between healthy controls and asthmatic individuals
in the score plot (Figure 3A). Aligning with the results of the correlation analysis,
this separation was driven by the OnPLS Component 1 score vectors
(Figure 3B). It was
then expected that PC2 would solely describe a sex difference, as
OnPLS Component 2 score vectors drove the separation. Interestingly,
PC2 actually described an interaction between disease and sex (Figure 3A). While there was
a sex difference among asthmatics, this was not observed in the controls.
Investigating the interaction between sex and disease was not an aim
of the original cohort study; however, this interaction was identified
by simultaneously modeling all the data in combination with integrative
visualization. In addition, the hierarchical PCA model corroborates
the correlation analysis, showing that OnPLS Components 1 and 2 contain
the most structural information. Therefore, these components were
selected for further exploration with MB-VIOP analysis.

Multi-block Variable Influence
on Orthogonal Projections (MB-VIOP)
To further investigate
the variables and their interactions underlying
the shared structure of OnPLS components 1 and 2, MB-VIOP variable
selection and subsequent correlation analysis were applied. A MB-VIOP
threshold of >1.0 was used to select the variables of interest
from
each component. For Component 1, 22 297 transcripts, 31 metabolites,
15 sphingolipids, 7 fatty acids, 16 oxylipins, and 9 clinical variables
contributed to explaining the shared structure describing disease
separation (Figure 4A). For visualization purposes, the MB-VIOP threshold was increased
to 2.0 for the Transcriptomics data block, leaving 151 variables.
For Component 2, 14 618 transcripts, 28 metabolites, 9 sphingolipids,
20 oxylipins, and 12 clinical variables contributed to explaining
the shared structure describing the interaction between sex and disease
(Figure 4B). The Transcriptomics
block appeared to have a strong influence on the disease–sex
interaction, with 1487 transcripts passing the higher MB-VIOP threshold
of 2.0; thus, the threshold was further increased to >2.5 to identify
only the strongest contributions, leaving 203 transcripts. The complete
list of all MB-VIOP values calculated for Components 1 and 2 is presented
in Tables S1–S6.

and >2.5 for Transcriptomics in Components 1 and 2, respectively.

In order to identify between-block biological interactions
in Components
1 and 2, chord plots were used to visualize correlations of variables
passing the specified MB-VIOP thresholds (Figure 5). This approach revealed a number of interesting
interactions, of which a selected few are discussed as examples of
the application of the proposed workflow. Five metabolites that correlated
with ICS dose30 (cortisol; cortisone; dehydroepiandrosterone
sulfate, DHEA-S; N-palmitoyltaurine, pipecolate) passed the MB-VIOP
threshold criteria for Component 1. These metabolites correlated with
the transcripts of 21 unique genes (Figure 5A), of which ATP6 V1G1 was
particularly interesting. ATP6 V1G1 has been implicated
in osteoporosis and specifically osteoclast function,40 which is a known side-effect of ICS treatment.41 This novel link may provide insights to the
mechanisms underlying bone density loss in asthma patients taking
ICS. In addition, NPAS2, a transcription factor involved
in mediating circadian rhythm,42 correlated
with five metabolites, four of which were ceramides (Figure 5A). Evidence suggests that
ceramide levels fluctuate diurnally;43,44 however, to
our knowledge, this is the first time an association has been made
between NPAS2 and ceramides. More importantly, as
all samples were collected at the same time of day (between 09:00
and 11:00), this supports emerging evidence of dysregulated circadian
rhythm gene expression in asthma.45 Indeed,
experiencing nocturnal symptoms more than once per week was a classification
criterion of severe asthma.29 The disease–sex
interaction identified by Component 2 was largely driven by differential
bronchoalveolar lavage cell profiles (eosinophils, macrophages) and
oxylipins (Figure 5B). It also identified a high degree of correlation between the oxylipins
and both PCDH10 and the uncharacterized gene locus
LOC284219, suggesting that these genes may play a previously unidentified
role in oxylipin metabolism. Together, these examples highlight the
value of this method for interrogating biology and generating hypotheses
from multiomics data.

By combining OnPLS multi-block
modeling with MB-VIOP variable selection
and various visualization methods, the composite of data derived from
this study could be interrogated. Where methods such as OPLS are useful
for identifying covariance in isolated data blocks, OnPLS offers the
advantage of identifying combined covariance, thus offering a more
complete understanding of the whole system. For example, when OPLS
was applied to the Metabolomics data block in isolation, 21 variables
had a VIPOPLS > 1.0 with dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate
(DHEA-S) being the strongest driver of the control–asthma difference
(Supplemental Tables). Component 1 of OnPLS
had 31 variables with a MB-VIOP > 1.0, 15 of which were unique
to
OnPLS modeling. Whereas DHEA-S was a major driver in the covariance
in the single-block analysis, it was less important in the combined
covariance of the OnPLS model. The Transcriptomics, Oxylipin, and
Clinical data blocks showed similar trends, with OPLS and OnPLS revealing
different biological insights (data not shown).

While the present
study shows the potential for OnPLS-based modeling
to be useful for simultaneously modeling multiple data blocks and
generating hypotheses, it is limited by sample size and study power.
Furthermore, OnPLS is currently unable to derive a block weighting
such that MB-VIOP values can be scaled and directly compared across
all blocks. Accordingly, MB-VIOP values can only be directly compared
within a given data block and not between blocks. In interpreting
the results, one must consider the overall contribution, not only
of the block per se but also of the individual variables, to the respective
component.

Conclusions
The multi-block OnPLS
method combined with MB-VIOP variable selection
and interaction visualization techniques yielded putative novel insights
into asthma disease pathogenesis, the effects of asthma treatment,
and biological roles of genes. The current study was performed in
a worst-case scenario approach using a small sample set, with unbalanced
groups and multiple study confounders. While these issues limit the
ability of the different components of the OnPLS model to identify
unique biological sources of variation, it demonstrates the potential
for this method for identifying key structure in -omics data integration.
It is likely that in large well-designed studies, the different components
would be able to identify and explain other sources of biological
and/or experimental variability (e.g., therapeutics, center bias,
diet). It is also possible that this approach would be useful in identifying
subphenotypes of disease, with different subgroups and/or mechanisms
described by different components. We therefore propose that OnPLS
modeling can be incorporated into large-scale molecular phenotyping
studies for stratified medicine. Given that the -omics technologies
detect molecules that function in a highly interdependent and dynamic
manner within a living system, multi-block methods such as OnPLS,
together with MB-VIOP and interaction visualization, provide a logical
approach to investigating systems biology.
