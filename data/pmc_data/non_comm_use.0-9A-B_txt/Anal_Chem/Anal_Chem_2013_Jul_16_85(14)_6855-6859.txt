Single-molecule confocal microscopy
experiments require concentrations
which are low enough to guarantee that, on average, less than one
single molecule resides in the probe volume at any given time. Such
concentrations are, however, significantly lower than the dissociation
constants of many biological complexes which can therefore dissociate
under single-molecule conditions. To address the challenge of observing
weakly bound complexes in single-molecule experiments in solution,
we have designed a microfluidic device that rapidly dilutes samples
by up to one hundred thousand times, allowing the observation of unstable
complexes before they dissociate. The device can interface with standard
biochemistry laboratory experiments and generates a spatially uniform
dilution that is stable over time allowing the quantification of the
relative concentrations of different molecular species.

==== Body
Single-molecule
fluorescence
spectroscopy is an important tool in the structural analysis of proteins
and nucleic acids, as it can resolve subpopulations and characterize
rare events by studying fluorophore-tagged molecules one by one. In
confocal experiments, single-molecule detection of free-flowing molecules
is achieved through a combination of a small confocal probe volume
(<1 fL) illuminated by focused laser beams1 and a low sample concentration, typically less than 100 pM.2 These two factors ensure that on average there
is less than one single molecule in the probe volume. However, picomolar
concentrations are significantly below the dissociation constants
of most biomolecular complexes, and thus the traditional confocal
single-molecule setup is not applicable to the study of unstable complexes.

Several methods for studying these biomolecular complexes with
single-molecule fluorescence have been developed. In some cases it
is not necessary to label both components in the complex; one partner
may be dual-labeled with a Förster resonance energy (FRET)
dye pair, and changes in transfer efficiency can be observed after
dilution into an excess of unlabeled ligand.3 However, this is not a general method and requires the ligand to
be at a concentration greater than the dissociation constant, which
can result in significant background noise from autofluorescence.
Wide-field techniques such as total internal reflection fluorescence
microscopy (TIRFM) can also be used to study such interactions by
immobilizing one biological molecule on the surface and observing
binding events with other biological molecules in solution.4 However, low off-rates are required to study
unstable complexes bound to the surface. An alternative strategy for
studying biomolecular complexes at low concentrations was developed
by Levene et al., who designed a nanostructured device that reduces
the effective observation volume to 1 zL (10–21 L)
allowing for fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) experiments
to be performed at micromolar concentrations.5 Single-molecule FRET experiments have also been performed on confined
molecules within 100 nm nanopipettes, allowing the experiments to
be performed at 50-fold higher concentrations than usual,6 and it may be possible to increase the concentration
further if narrower pipettes are used to further reduce the probe
volume. However, this would require the use of quartz pipettes increasing
the complexity of the experiments substantially, in particular, requiring
the alignment of the pipet with the confocal laser probe volume, as
well as the prevention of adsorption of molecular species to the surface
of the pipet.

Here we present a microfluidic device for the
study of unstable
complexes, which interfaces with a standard single-molecule fluorescence
setup. The microfluidic chip is used to allow a rapid, stable, and
automated dilution of the sample down to single-molecule conditions.
Since microfluidic chips have become commonplace in single-molecule
experiments,2,7,8 the
use of such a device adds no further complexity to the system and
is able to combine the benefits of the strategies mentioned above
for studying unstable complexes with those of the traditional single-molecule
setup. In particular, it enables the study of such complexes without
any additional surface patterning or surface chemistry modification,
and in an automated, continuous, and time-resolved manner.

Results
and Discussion
Figure 1b shows the
design of the microfluidic
device used to achieve a 1:100 000 dilution. Key to the design
of the device is that the flow control is achieved through a single
pressure, applied at the outlet, and that changes in the volume of
the sample and therefore the hydrostatic pressure are compensated
by identical changes in the pressure of the dilution buffer channel,
allowing the dilution to be constant over time and space and eliminating
the need to insert samples through syringes (see the Supporting Information). At each of the four-way junctions
of the device, the sample and the buffer combine at rates which give
rise to a 1:10 dilution (Figure 2). There are
five four-way junctions in total, leading to an overall dilution of
1:100 000. The lengths of resistor elements within the device,
and therefore the relevant flow rates for each dilution step,9−11 were set using the analogues of Kirchoff’s laws for microfluidic
circuit design (Supporting Information).

Figure 1 (a) Schematic
of the experimental setup, consisting of an inverted
confocal fluorescence microscope interfaced with the autodilution
device. (b) Plan of the microfluidic device. Each junction between
the sample and buffer channel leads to a 1:10 dilution, leading to
a 1:100 000 dilution in total. A pressure gradient between
the buffer/analyte inlets and the outlet is achieved by withdrawing
sample from the outlet. The red and green dashed boxes correspond
to the fluorescence images of the regions shown in Figure 2b.

Figure 2 (a) Normalized intensity of fluorescein fluorescence after each
step in the dilution device. Each step results in 1:10 dilution, leading
to an overall dilution of 1:100 000 after five steps. Blue
squares show the normalized concentration determined from a starting
solution of 10 mg/mL fluorescein, green circles show the normalized
concentration from a starting concentration of 1 mg/mL fluorescein,
and the purple triangle shows the concentration determined by comparing
the burst rate of the autodilution with that from a manual dilution
of 1:100 000. (b) Left: two adjacent dilution stages. Right:
the four-way junction at one of the dilution steps (fluorescence image
with concentrated fluorescein being diluted), showing clearly that
only a small fraction of the solution to be diluted is taken into
the next stage.

The total dilution factor
can be varied by changing the number
of dilution steps. The minimum time to allow for 99% mixing of solute
with buffer between steps is related to the diffusion coefficient, D (m2/s), of the species being analyzed and the
width of the channel, w, as approximated by eq 1, (for derivation, see the Supporting
Information): 1  If faster dilution times are needed
for more
unstable complexes, the withdraw rate can be set higher than indicated
in eq 1. However, the absolute dilution factor
will then be greater than 100 000, as less than 1 in 10 of
the molecules will be present in the fraction progressing to the next
dilution stage. Thus, there is a compromise between the accuracy of
the dilution factor and the speed of the dilution. For diffusion coefficients
typical of biological macromolecules (D ≈
10–6 cm2/s), the total dilution time
is on the order of seconds. This makes the device suitable for studying
complexes that have an off-rate (koff)
lower than approximately 1 s–1, which is sufficient
for most protein–protein and protein–DNA complexes.
If the off-rate is higher, and hence only a fraction of molecules
are associated, then FRET efficiencies can still be determined, although
part of the sample will contribute to the zero-peak. In addition,
the width of the channels can be made narrower to decrease the time
required for diffusion. We note that the dilution prepared in this
manner on chip is uniform in space, a factor which is crucial for
the quantification of the relative concentrations of heterogeneous
species.

We characterized each step of the dilution using a
combination
of bulk and single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. Figure 2a shows the mean, normalized fluorescence intensity
after each dilution step, demonstrating that each four-way junction
results in a 1:10 dilution.

Values for the first four steps
were obtained by diluting a fluorescein
solution in water from starting concentrations of 1 and 10 mg/mL.
Two concentrations were used due to quenching of the fluorophore at
high concentration and lack of signal at low concentration. The solution
was withdrawn at a flow rate of 5 μL/h, and the fluorescence
levels after each stage were measured (mean and SD, n = 3 in different regions). To determine the overall dilution factor,
a 2 × 10–3 mg/mL solution of fluorescein was
first diluted manually by 1:100 000 into PBS before being added
to a clean coverslip mounted on the single-molecule confocal microscope
(Figure 1a and the Methods section). The sample was illuminated at 488 nm, and light was collected
in the green fluorescence channel; bursts with intensity greater than
10 counts/bin were counted, and the burst rate was determined to be
40 ± 10 s–1 (mean ± SD, n = 3; the burst rate from buffer alone was 0.16 s–1). The 2 × 10–3 mg/mL sample was then diluted
using the autodilution device at a withdraw rate of 5 μL/h where
the velocity of the molecules in the detection region at this flow
rate is dominated by free diffusion. The burst rate in this case,
with identical thresholding, was 44 ± 40 s–1 (mean ± SD, n = 3 in different devices; the
burst rate from buffer alone was 0.15 s–1), matching
the manual dilution burst rate within error.

To test the ability
to detect weakly associated biological complexes,
we designed a DNA duplex with a dissociation rate close to the upper
limit of the device. We measured the stability and binding kinetics
of the duplex using a combination of thermal melting and stopped-flow
spectroscopy, which showed that the DNA duplex had a dissociation
constant of 230 nM and an off-rate of 0.129 s–1 (see
the Supporting Information). One of the
strands was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488), and the complementary
strand was labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 (AF647), and the dye pair
was close enough for FRET to occur. A 10 μM concentration of
the duplex was first diluted manually by 1:100 000 into PBS
before being loaded and passed through the simple one-channel microfluidic
device mounted on the single-molecule confocal microscope at a velocity
of 0.1 cm s–1. The top panel of Figure 3 shows the FRET efficiency histogram generated.
Due to the high off-rate and slow manual dilution, only a zero-peak
corresponding to AF488-labeled single-stranded DNA was observed. The
10 μM duplex was then loaded into the autodilution device, with
PBS being loaded into the buffer inlet. The device was mounted onto
the single-molecule confocal setup, and sample was withdrawn from
the device at a rate of 200 μL/h. The mean flow velocity across
the dilution channels of the device was measured using fluorescence
correlation spectroscopy (FCS) (see the Supporting
Information) and was determined to be 1.07 ± 0.02 cm/s,
meaning that each dilution step takes approximately 0.93 s, giving
a total dilution time of 4.67 s. The typical diffusion coefficient
for a 20 base-pair DNA duplex is on the order of 1 × 10–10 m2/s,12 and so our dilution
time is slightly faster than the minimum time of 1.74 s required for
the duplex to diffuse across the width of the channel before each
dilution step (eq 1). This gives rise to an
overall dilution factor of 1:144 000 (using Supporting Information eq 16). The bottom panel of Figure 3 shows the resulting FRET efficiency histogram.
As the dilution occurred rapidly, events resulting from the associated
DNA duplex were detected (EFRET = 0.6),
demonstrating that the device was able to measure FRET efficiency
distributions for weakly associated complexes. Typical binned photon-burst
data from which the histograms were generated are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S12).

Figure 3 FRET efficiency
histograms of the unstable dual labeled DNA duplex
with koff = 0.129 s–1. Both data sets were taken at the same flow rate in the detection
region (0.1 cm/s) and analyzed using the SUM criterion with a threshold
of 15 counts/bin. Top: the manually diluted duplex (105× diluted to 10 pM) shows a large zero-peak due to the presence
of only single-stranded DNA. Bottom: diluted sample in the autodilution
device. Due to the rapid dilution, many events from the double-stranded
duplex are observed as a second peak with a higher FRET efficiency.
The peaks were fitted to Gaussian distributions using the multipeak
fitting package in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics).

Although microfluidic devices for on-chip dilution have been
designed
previously to produce both logarithmic13,14 and linear
dilution series,15−21 they often require multiple inlet pressures to be controlled (typically
using syringe pumps), making them less stable and straightforward
to use. More complex implementations of on-chip dilution have also
been demonstrated. In one case, an arbitrary dilution factor can be
achieved by circulating the solution to be diluted and adding buffer
and removing waste during each circuit.22 However, this requires a complex system of valves in addition to
three-layer lithography. This system uses sample volumes as low as
400 nL and requires a minimum mixing time of 22 s. Devices capable
of generating a radial concentration gradient have also been designed,23 as well as chips able to produce gradients in
two dimensions with a dilution series over three different components.24 A simple form of dilution relies on the outward
diffusion of a sample into buffer in a flow focusing geometry, forming
a distribution which is approximately Gaussian. However, it would
be difficult to achieve stable high dilutions using such a system,
since the local concentration of the sample and the flow rate is extremely
sensitive to the detector position, which is difficult to place with
high precision and can be displaced over the course of a measurement
leading to a bias and apparent variability in the concentrations of
the species under study.

Conclusions
Whereas other microfluidic
devices have been used to measure the
kinetics of protein conformation change after a change in buffer conditions
followed by rapid mixing,7,9,25,26 we have designed a fully automated,
easy-to-use, microfluidic device that is able to measure unstable
biological complexes under nonequilibrium conditions after high dilution.
This device can be used in conjunction with single-molecule confocal
microscopy to study biological complexes. Crucially, this implementation
requires only a single negative pressure, imposed using a syringe
pump, at the outlet of the device. The reagents being drawn into the
inlets can thus be maintained in a controlled environment, rather
than being discharged from syringes. The use of only one syringe also
means that the system is stable at lower flow rates than possible
using two or more syringes, since flow rates here are all set relative
to a single pressure.

This device will allow a wide range of
new biological processes
and interactions to be probed at the single-molecule level; for example,
for our own work it will allow us to follow protein aggregation reactions
in real time and study interactions of chaperones with proteins and
ubiquitin chains with substrates.

Methods
Device Fabrication
Microfluidic channels were fabricated
using standard soft-lithography techniques27 into poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS; Dow Corning) with SU-8 photoresist
on silicon masters. The channels were plasma-bonded to glass coverslides
(V.W.R., thickness = 1) to create sealed devices. The channel height
was 25 μm. Each device was inspected on a white-light microscope
(Nikon Ti-U), and only those without dust or aberrations were used.

Synthetic Oligonucleotides
The sequences of the oligonucleotides
used in this study are given in Supporting Information Table S2. Oligonucleotides were purchased from ATDBio Ltd. (Southampton,
U.K.) and were purified by double HPLC by the supplier. Duplexes were
formed by diluting complementary strands into syringe-filtered (pore
size 0.02 μm, Whatman, Maidstone, U.K.) phosphate-buffered saline,
PBS (0.01 M phosphate buffer, 0.0027 M potassium chloride, and 0.137
M sodium chloride, pH 7.4), heating to 95 °C, and cooling to
room temperature over 2 h. Oligo-1 and oligo-2 were combined to form
the unstable duplex (KD = 230 nM, koff = 0.129 s–1) which was
used to demonstrate the rapid dilution.

Single-Molecule Measurements
Single-molecule experiments
were performed on a custom-built confocal microscope. Briefly, a Gaussian
beam at 488 nm (Spectra Physics Cyan CDRH) was directed through the
back port of an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti-U)
and reflected by a dichroic mirror through an immersion oil objective
(Apochromat 60×, NA 1.40, Nikon) to be focused 10 μm into
the detection region of the microfluidic device. Fluorescence was
collected via the same objective and reflected by the dichroic mirror
and imaged onto a 50 μm pinhole (Thorlabs). A second dichroic
mirror (585DRLP Omega Filters) separated the fluorescence into two
separate channels. Green fluorescence from Alexa Fluor 488 was first
passed through long-pass and band-pass filters (540ALP and 535AF45,
Omega Optical Filters) before being focused onto an avalanche photodiode,
APD (SPCM-14, Perkin-Elmer, and Waltham, MA). Red fluorescence from
Alexa Fluor 647 was also passed through long-pass and band-pass filters
(565ALP and 695AF55, Omega Optical Filters) before being focused onto
a second APD. Outputs from the two APDs were connected to a custom-programmed
field-programmable gate array, FPGA (Colexica), which counted the
signals and combined them into time bins (1 ms) which were selected
according to the expected residence time of molecules traveling through
the confocal volume.2 A CCD camera (Watek)
was used to carefully position the confocal volume within the microfluidic
channel. For microfluidic measurements, the device was mounted onto
the single-molecule instrument, and data was collected by focusing
10 μm into the center of the device channels. Data was collected
for 30 min in all FRET experiments, and the intensity at the back-port
of the microscope was 90 μW.

After subtraction of the
average autofluorescence for each channel (0.67 counts/bin for the
donor channel and 0.541 counts/bin for the acceptor channel), and
correction for the spectral cross-talk from the donor channel into
the acceptor channel (3%), a threshold of 15 counts/bin (the sum of
the photon counts from the donor and acceptor channel) was used to
separate the photon-burst events from the dual-labeled DNA duplex
from the background. The FRET efficiencies (proximity ratios) are
calculated from the measured donor (ID) and acceptor (IA) fluorescence intensities
according to eq 2: 2  FRET efficiencies were calculated for all
events and combined to form a FRET efficiency histogram.
