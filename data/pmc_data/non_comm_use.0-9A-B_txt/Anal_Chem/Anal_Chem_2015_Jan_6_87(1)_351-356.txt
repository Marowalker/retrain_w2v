Salt
removal is a prerequisite for electrospray ionization mass
spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis of biological samples. Rapid desalting
and a low volume connection to an electrospray tip are required for
time-resolved measurements. We have developed a microfabricated desalting
device that meets both requirements, thus providing the foundational
technology piece for transient ESI-MS measurements of complex biological
liquid specimens. In the microfabricated device, the sample flows
in a channel separated from a higher flow rate, salt-free counter
solution by a monolithically integrated nanoporous alumina membrane,
which can support pressure differences between the flow channels of
over 600 kPa. Salt is removed by exploiting the large difference in
diffusivities between salts and the typical ESI-MS target bioanalytes,
e.g., peptides and proteins. We demonstrate the capability to remove
95% of salt from a sample solution in ∼1 s while retaining
sufficiently high concentration of a relatively low molecular weight
protein, cytochrome-c, for ESI-MS detection.

Electrospray ionization mass
spectrometry (ESI-MS) has become a powerful and widely used tool for
biological research and, as a result, was recognized with the Nobel
Prize for Chemistry in 2002.1 In ESI, electrohydrodynamic
forces produce a highly charged aerosol from a liquid sample.2 The resulting soft ionization of dissolved molecules
within the droplets preserves many important biochemical details,
and multiple charging of analytes allows detection of large molecules
that could otherwise be outside of the range of the mass spectrometer.3 A difficulty in application of ESI-MS to biological
samples is the negative impact of salts on the method,4 and salt removal is therefore an important part of ESI-MS
workflows.5 Off-line desalting is predominantly
via solid phase extraction (SPE).6 In online
salt removal, which brings advantages such as increased analysis speed,
repeatability, and decreased minimum sample size, a desalting device
is integrated into the flowpath leading to the ESI capillary.7,8 Online salt removal can be via differential diffusion (dialysis),
size exclusion (ultrafiltration), and differential surface chemical
affinities (SPE). The most straightforward online desalting method
is simply an online approach to SPE using switching valves to transition
from sample concentration/desalting to elution. The disadvantages
of online SPE for some applications include increased process time
and change from water to an organic solvent. Thus, there has been
interest in developing non-SPE online desalting approaches.

Most non-SPE online salt removal approaches have been modifications
of the approach pioneered by the Smith group using a cellulose dialysis
tube.9,10 In these approaches, the sample flows through
the porous walled tube while a dialysis buffer solution flows outside
of the tube, and salt diffuses from the inner to outer flowstream
while higher molecular weight analytes are retained in the inner stream,
both due to the filtering property of the membrane and the lesser
mobility of larger molecules as compared to the salt ions. These devices
are hand assembled, with the inlet and outlet sample tubing glued
into the dialysis tube. Improvements of online dialysis devices have
included (i) reduction in dead volume and therefore expansion to lower
flow rate, (ii) size reduction, i.e., reduction in sample channel
transverse dimension, and (iii) efforts toward microfabrication of
dialysis devices. Dead volume reduction enables reduced flow rates
and sample sizes, which allows online connection to nano-ESI-MS and
thus improved sensitivity.11,12 Size minimization reduces
transport time scales and therefore reduces the required sample transit
time: such mass transport length scale reductions for tube-in-tube
devices have improved performance by changing online desalting times
from ∼20 min to ∼1 min.10,13

Microfabrication
is a clear route to size reduction, but the geometry
of the tube-in-tube dialysis approach is not easily incorporated into
the planar layout of microfabricated devices. Therefore, the tube-in-tube
approach was abstracted to a sandwich approach,14,15 with a flat cellulose membrane placed between microchannels on opposing
chips. This approach, which can be seen as the first step toward a
fully microfabricated lab-on-a-chip device, reduced desalting times
to as low as 12 s. Microfabrication of the separation membrane as
an integral part of the chip-scale device is seen as an important
step toward incorporation of online membrane based desalting for ESI-MS
in batch fabricated devices, and Song et al. reported the first planar,
microfabricated dialysis devices with integral membranes, using nanoporous
polymer membranes fabricated on the device.16 The demonstrated performance was not better than that of the best
cellulose membrane based devices, with desalting times of ∼1
min. The most likely reason for the failure of their microfabricated
device to realize a performance improvement is that the limiting mass
transfer resistance is in the membrane, not the flow streams, and
so size reduction of the sample channel does not reduce required residence
time. This is highlighted by the approach that has the best demonstrated
performance, with less than 1 s required for desalting demonstrated
in a laminar coflow microfluidic device.17 This device eliminates the use of a membrane completely and carefully
brings the sample and buffer streams together without mixing, having
them coflow in the same direction, and then separates the two streams.
The main limitation to this membraneless laminar coflow approach is
that the buffer and sample stream must be in mechanical equilibrium,
i.e., at the same pressure at each streamwise position, which is a
difficult-to-meet constraint. In this letter, we report the demonstration
of a microfabricated, monolithic device, which not only achieves the
time response and separation effectiveness matching those of the membraneless
approach but importantly also enables desalting without limitation
on the sample pressure. This flexibility in the choice of sample pressure
provides a route for downstream integration with a large set of classical
and emerging ionization methods operating over a broad range of pressures,
including ambient and subambient, coupled to active and passive sampling
methods.18−23

We have developed a planar microfabricated device that meets
the
requirements for online chip based dialytic salt removal for ambient
ESI-MS with ∼1 s transit time, through monolithic incorporation
of an ultrathin integral membrane made of porous alumina (Figure 1). Approaches to integration of porous alumina membranes
into MEMS devices have been developed over the past decade,24 and microfabrication of a freestanding nanoporous
membrane of less than 10 μm thickness as one wall of microfabricated
sample channel was accomplished by Narayanan et al.25 Porous alumina membranes have remarkably well ordered,
straight, uniform, high density pores, and thus, provide for a given
thickness, a minimal resistance to mass transfer. The membranes in
the device described in this work restrict transmembrane flow sufficiently
such that mass transport across the membrane is dominated by diffusion.
This conclusion is based both upon an experimentally validated model
for salt removal in the device that includes transmembrane flow (Supporting Information) and successful application
of the device to desalting for ESI-MS analysis. The membranes, despite
being ultrathin, are mechanically robust enough to support pressure
differences in excess of 600 kPa. Because the sample channel is patterned
in SU-8, addition of the SU-8 based nib-type nanoelectrospray tip
as developed by Le Gac et al.26 for monolithically
batch microfabricated online dialysis ESI devices is straightforward.
The microfabricated device consists of a sample channel that has a
rectangular cross section with a height of 6 μm and a width
of 100 μm (Figure 1). The channel is
defined on the lateral walls by SU-8 photoresist. The dimensions of
the channel were chosen as a compromise between minimizing mass transfer
resistance within the sample channel, which is proportional to channel
height, and minimizing clogs. An ∼5 μm thick porous anodic
alumina membrane that provides transport access to a buffer fluid
outside of the channel constitutes the top wall. The thickness of
the membrane is based on ensuring sufficient mechanical strength while
also minimizing mass transport resistance, which is proportional to
membrane thickness. The bottom wall is a borosilicate glass substrate
that allows visibility into the channel to monitor flow and to detect
bubbles and clogging during device operation. The high aspect ratio
etched orifices in the silicon substrate provide an inlet and an outlet
from the sample channel into fluidic interfaces, which are suitable
for integration with the sampling probe tip (at the inlet) and the
ion source (at the outlet). Details of microfabrication and packaging
are provided in the Supporting Information.

microfabricated device sectioned view (bottom).

Experimental characterization of the microfabricated salt
removal
devices includes two assessments: (1) the amount of salt removed is
determined and (2) resulting improvement in the mass spectrum. The
effectiveness of the microfabricated device at removing salt was tested
by forcing a salt solution (300 mM KCl in DI water, where the concentration
is chosen to ensure detection of salt after dialysis) through the
sample channel at flow rates ranging from 30 to 150 μL/h and
DI water through the buffer channel at a flow rate of 50 mL/h. The
salt solution was collected at the sample outlet, and chloride concentration
of the collected sample is measured using argentometric titration
(Mohr method).27 The change in chloride
ion concentration in the solution due to treatment with the device
is an indication of the effectiveness of the device at removing salt.
Experimental results are plotted in Figure 2 as removal percent effectiveness, 100% (1 – Cout/Cin) where Cout and Cin are average molar
concentrations at the sample channel outlet and inlet, respectively.
Also plotted in Figure 2 is the curve of predicted
effectiveness from a mass transfer model of the device (Supporting Information), which is found to accurately
predict device performance.

Figure 2 Plot of experimentally determined salt removal
effectiveness vs
sample residence time (red). Error bars are based on the titration
method error determined via blinded experiments with known concentration
samples. The black curve depicts the prediction obtained from solving
the model equations numerically in MATLAB.

To facilitate analysis and understanding of the desalting
quantification
experimental results, and to serve as a tool for future device design
and operational guidance, we have developed a simple model that captures
all relevant dominant physics of the microfabricated desalting device
(see the Supporting Information). The two-dimensional
steady state model is based on the following assumptions and simplifications:
(1) pressure drop in the sample channel can be well approximated using
a unidirectional (parallel) laminar fully developed flow model; (2)
salt concentration in the buffer solution far from the membrane is
approximately zero; (3) mass transfer of the salt can be well described
using a Fickian diffusion model with an effective binary diffusion
coefficient; (4) properties (e.g., density, viscosity) of the sample
liquid are uniform; and (5) transmembrane flow rates are low enough
that the Peclet number for mass transfer remains small in the membrane
and mass transfer across the membrane is dominated by diffusion while
(6) sample channel flow rates remain sufficiently large that the mass
transport in the sample flow direction is dominated by advection.

The highest residence time in Figure 2,
1.2 s, which occurs at the lowest flow rate, 30 μL/h (8.33 nL/s),
corresponds to flow rates approaching, but greater than, those that
produce the benefits of nano-ESI-MS.28 Lower
residence times (higher flow rates) are included primarily for the
purpose of model validation. Inspection of Figure 2 indicates that the model is impressively accurate considering
that it is based strictly on first-principles without using any “fitting”
parameters. The only experimentally derived input is the membrane
hydraulic permeability, which is an intrinsic property of the membrane
itself and was determined from independent characterization experiments.
Importantly, in determining the membrane hydraulic permeability (see
the Supporting Information) the membranes
were subjected to differential pressures exceeding 600 kPa without
experiencing failure, indicating their mechanical robustness. Having
demonstrated the predictive capability of the model one can use it
to obtain insight into device behavior. A critical observation is
that the mass transfer resistance in the buffer is larger than both
the mass transfer resistance in the membrane and the mass transfer
resistance in the sample channel. Thus, the membrane does not significantly
reduce mass transfer performance below that achievable in a device
without a membrane, and performance improvements should focus on reduction
of buffer mass transfer resistance. Furthermore, the transmembrane
velocity never becomes large enough to significantly alter the mass
transfer resistance through the membrane, as can be seen by estimating
the relative importance of advection to diffusion given by the mass
transfer Peclet number, which remains below 10–2 for the range of pressures and flow rates for which we tested the
device.

The device’s ability to enable the identification
of an
analyte in a solution with high salt content by nano-ESI-MS was also
demonstrated. Solutions used for this assessment were (1) 40 μM
cytochrome-c in DI water, (2) 40 μM cytochrome-c in 100 mM KCl,
untreated, and (3) 40 μM cytochrome-c in 100 mM KCl, treated
by flowing it through the sample channel of a microfabricated desalting
device at 30 μL/h. Each sample was subjected to nano-ESI-MS
analysis on a Bruker MicroTOF mass spectrometer under identical spray
conditions, and the resulting mass spectra (1 s average) are displayed
in Figure 3.

The sample whose spectrum
is displaced in Figure 3a serves as a control,
as this is the spectrum that is obtained
when no KCl is added and no cytochrome-c is lost. Figure 3b, which is also a control, demonstrates quite well
the problem with salt. With 100 mM KCl present, all evidence of cytochrome-c
is lost from the spectrum. This is in spite of the fact that nano-ESI-MS
is much more salt tolerant than conventional ESI-MS.4 After passage of the salty sample through the salt removal
device at 30 μL/h, which the model and experiment show will
lower the salt concentration to ∼5 mM, most, but not all, of
the peaks associated with cytochrome-c are visible again in Figure 3c. There are several possible explanations for the
differences between the spectra in parts a and c of Figure 3. First, and perhaps most likely, 5 mM is still
a relatively high salt concentration for nano-ESI-MS, so salt removal
may not have been sufficient. That salt is still impacting the spectral
quality as evident by comparing the narrow m/z range insets in the spectra. Second, salt removal efficiency
was quantified and model accuracy was verified measuring the anion
(Cl–) concentration, but the cation (K+) is most responsible for degrading the spectrum in the positive
mode nano-ESI used here. Therefore, if the device behaves differently
for cation removal then it may not be as effective as predicted for
positive mode nano-ESI-MS experiments. This possibility seems unlikely
for several reasons. When KCl is the only salt and there are no other
sources of charge, then potassium cation and chloride anion concentrations
will be equal everywhere that electroneutrality holds outside of any
Debye layer at the solid/liquid interfaces. Because of the large disparity
between the Debye length, ∼1 nm29 for 300 mM KCl in water and the pore diameter, ∼50 nm, and
because both ions have nearly identical diffusion coefficients in
water, the use of chloride ion concentration as a proxy for potassium
ion concentration is justified, especially in light of the robust
and accurate titration method available for chloride determination.
Finally, it is important to consider the possibility that a significant
quantity of analyte was lost during the dialysis. This possibility
can be evaluated using the model by replacing the diffusion coefficient
for the salt (2 × 10–9 m2/s) with
that for the analyte (1.0 × 10–10 m2/s for cytochrome-c30). Indeed, use of
the model indicates that ∼50% of the analyte is expected to
have been removed at the lowest flow rate (Figure 4), and thus the sample that produced the spectrum in Figure 3c would, according to the model, have a salt concentration
of 5 mM and analyte concentration of 19 μM. The higher salt
and lower analyte concentration between that samples used to produce
the spectra in parts a and c of Figure 3 are
consistent with the observed relative spectral intensities.

Figure 3 Mass spectra
from experiments to demonstrate utility of salt removal
device for positive mode nano-ESI MS: (a) control sample with 40 μM
cytochrome-c in DI water; (b) untreated sample, 40 μM cytochrome-c
in 100 mM KCl; and, (c) treated sample, 40 μM cytochrome-c in
100 mM KCl under conditions corresponding to 1.3 s residence time
in Figure 2. The charge states of cytochrome-c
are labeled in blue in parts a and c. The source of the unlabeled
peaks evident between the 5+ and 6+ charge states, and between the
6+ and 7+ charge states has not been identified.

Figure 4 Simulation results depicting the impact of diffusion coefficient
and pore size on removal effectiveness under conditions corresponding
to 1.3 s residence time in Figure 2. Chemical
species listed on the top axis are positioned according to their diffusion
coefficients in water. Red species are interfering salt ions, while
blue species are representative analytes. The negative effectiveness
for very low diffusion coefficient and the largest pore size indicates
an interesting effect of “analyte enrichment” by the
device under these conditions. Curves are for pore diameters of 50
nm (black/solid), 15 nm (red/dashed), and 6 nm (blue/dots).

The purpose of this work is to
develop, demonstrate, and make available
an approach for microfabrication, with a monolithically integrated
membrane, of a microfluidic device for desalting which is compatible
with ambient and subambient pressure ESI-MS. The experimental results
demonstrate that the device can reduce chloride ion concentration
in a high concentration solution of KCl in water from 300 mM to less
than 15 mM in just over a second at micro-ESI flow rates (8.3 nL/s).
Furthermore, at that flow rate, we demonstrate that salt concentration
reduction has the desired effect on a sample in which salt prevents
analyte detection by nano-ESI-MS. It enables successful MS analysis,
in spite of significant reduction in analyte concentration when the
analyte diffusion coefficient differs by just over 1 order of magnitude
from that of the salt. The device performance suffers currently from
a “parasitic” diffusional loss of analyte; however,
the experimentally validated model enables in silico investigation of the performance for different membrane pore sizes,
which hinder diffusion of larger molecules in a predictable manner.31 As depicted in Figure 4, for pore sizes of 6 nm, achievable using low voltage anodization
in sulfuric acid,32 analyte loss is reduced
to nearly 0% while interfering salt ion removal effectiveness is retained.
Further improvement would be expected through (1) reduction of buffer
mass transfer resistance, (2) reduction in sample channel length for
adaptation to lower nano-ESI flow rates, and (3) incorporation of
a monolithically integrated nano-ESI tip.
