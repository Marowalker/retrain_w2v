Development of efficient methods
for highly sensitive and rapid
screening of specific oligonucleotide sequences is essential to the
early diagnosis of serious diseases. In this work, an aggregated cationic
perylene diimide (PDI) derivative was found to efficiently quench
the fluorescence emission of a variety of anionic oligonucleotide-labeled
fluorophores that emit at wavelengths from the visible to NIR region.
This broad-spectrum quencher was then adopted to develop a multicolor
biosensor via a label-free approach for multiplexed fluorescent detection
of DNA. The aggregated perylene derivative exhibits a very high quenching
efficiency on all ssDNA-labeled dyes associated with biosensor detection,
having efficiency values of 98.3 ± 0.9%, 97 ± 1.1%, and
98.2 ± 0.6% for FAM, TAMRA, and Cy5, respectively. An exonuclease-assisted
autocatalytic target recycling amplification was also integrated into
the sensing system. High quenching efficiency combined with autocatalytic
target recycling amplification afforded the biosensor with high sensitivity
toward target DNA, resulting in a detection limit of 20 pM, which
is about 50-fold lower than that of traditional unamplified homogeneous
fluorescent assay methods. The quencher did not interfere with the
catalytic activity of nuclease, and the biosensor could be manipulated
in either preaddition or postaddition manner with similar sensitivity.
Moreover, the proposed sensing system allows for simultaneous and
multicolor analysis of several oligonucleotides in homogeneous solution,
demonstrating its potential application in the rapid screening of
multiple biotargets.

The development
of efficient
methods for highly sensitive and rapid detection of sequence-specific
oligonucleotides is essential for the early diagnosis of serious diseases.
In particular, insertion/deletion variations in oligonucleotides can
lead to the onset of certain cancers and some genetic diseases1−3 as well as individual differences in drug metabolism.4,5 On the basis of their simplicity, low-cost, high sensitivity, rapid
analysis, and little proclivity to sample or cell damage, fluorescent
methods have attracted much attention and have been widely applied
for the detection of various biomolecules.6−9 In the past decade, the design
of fluorescent biosensors for oligonucleotides has also attracted
considerable attention.10−12 Note that, although polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) is the gold standard for DNA detection (for example,
Banada et al. reported an assay based on PCR for highly sensitive
detection of Staphylococcus aureus directly from
patient blood13), specific and expensive
equipment is required. Most fluorescent biosensors are based on the
use of a nonfluorescent quencher, which endows the sensing system
with high sensitivity. To date, the most frequently used commercial
quenchers are small organic molecules. However, they usually require
conjugation on the probe through tedious modifying steps, and they
suffer from low, or variant, quenching efficiency for fluorophores
that emit at different wavelengths.14,15

A variety
of nanomaterial-based quenchers, including carbon nanomaterials
and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), have been developed with high quenching
efficiency.16−19 For example, AuNPs are able to quench FAM with a quenching efficiency
100-fold higher than that of organic quenchers.20 Nevertheless, these AuNP-based methods generally exhibit
poor salt and thermal stability, thus limiting their practical applications.20,21 It has also been proven that the fluorescence of different kinds
of dyes can be efficiently quenched by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or
graphene. However, proteins and other biomolecules are prone to nonspecific
adsorption on CNTs or graphene, which may inhibit the activity of
these biomolecules to some extent.22−24 Chen et al. reported
a broad-spectrum nanoquencher by incorporating a series of dark quenchers
into mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs),25 which could efficiently quench a broad range of visible and near-infrared
(NIR) fluorophores. However, tedious steps were required to prepare
the reported nanoquencher. The development of an easily synthesized,
broad-spectrum fluorescent quencher with high quenching efficiency,
as well as high biocompatibility and stability, is therefore highly
desirable.

Perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives have been reported
as excellent
fluorophores because of their high fluorescence quantum yield and
photostability, high thermal stability, and excellent chemical inertness.26 A cationic perylene diimide derivative (PDI,
Figure 1) was reported to associate with single-stranded
DNA (ssDNA) with efficient fluorescence quenching.27 In this work, we first report that cationic aggregated
and quenched perylene can act as a broad-spectrum and label-free quencher
via strong electrostatic interactions. When aggregated on oligonucleotides,
PDI is able to efficiently quench a variety of adjacent conjugated
anionic fluorophores that emit over a wide wavelength range from the
visible to NIR region. This broad-spectrum quencher was then employed
to develop a multicolor biosensor for multiplexed fluorescent detection
of DNA via a label-free approach. Aggregated PDI exhibits a very high
quenching efficiency on all ssDNA-labeled fluorophores of the sensing
system, allowing low background fluorescence and therefore low detection
limits.

Exonuclease III (Exo III) is a sequence-independent
enzyme that
does not require a specific recognition site and can catalyze the
stepwise removal of mononucleotides from 3′-hydroxyl termini
of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA).28−31 Therefore, an Exo III-assisted autocatalytic target
recycling amplification was also integrated into the sensing system.
Formation of dsDNA through the hybridization of the target with the
linear probe leads to the digestion of dsDNA by Exo III and subsequent
release of the target, which can repeatedly hybridize with new linear
probes, leading to the digestion of abundant dsDNAs by Exo III.31 High quenching efficiency combined with autocatalytic
target recycling amplification afforded the biosensor high sensitivity
toward target DNA, resulting in a detection limit of 20 pM, which
is about 50-fold lower than that of traditional unamplified homogeneous
fluorescent assay methods. Moreover, the biosensor could discriminate
perfectly matched target DNA from mismatched DNA. Simultaneous and
multicolor analysis of several oligonucleotides in homogeneous solution
was also achieved by the proposed sensing system, thus demonstrating
its potential application in the rapid screening of multiple biotargets.
Finally, our designed strategy is universal and may be useful in the
detection of other target DNA analytes.

Experimental Section
Reagents
and Apparatus
DNA oligonucleotides used in
this work were synthesized and purified by SangonBiotechnology Co.,
Ltd. (Shanghai, China), and their sequences are shown in Table S1
in the Supporting Information. Perylenetetracarboxylicdianhydride
and N,N-dimethyl-1,3-propanediamine
were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Methyl iodide and other compounds
were obtained from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co. (Shanghai, China).
All chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification.
The nuclease exonuclease III was purchased from New England Biolabs.
All solutions were prepared in Milli-Q water (resistance >18 MΩ
cm) from a Millipore system. All fluorescence measurements were carried
out on a Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorometer (HORIBA JobinYvon, Edison,
NJ). All measurements were carried out at room temperature unless
stated otherwise.

Quenching Efficiency Investigation
Different concentrations
of PDI were added to solutions containing 10 μL of 1 μM
various fluorophore-labeled DNA (FAM-P1, TAMRA-P2, Cy5-P3). In all
cases, the total volume of the reaction solution was 100 μL.
After incubation for 10 min, the fluorescence was measured by FluoroMax-4
spectrofluorometer (HORIBA JobinYvon, Edison, NJ).

Procedures
for DNA Detection
For DNA detection, 100
nM of TAMRA DNA probe was first incubated with 14 μL of 10 μM
PDI at room temperature in a buffer solution (10 mM 1, 3-bis (tris
(hydroxymethyl)methylamino)propane-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1
mM dithiothreitol (DTT), pH 7.0). After 10 min, different concentrations
of target DNA and 4 U of endonuclease Exo III were added to the sample
solution. Then the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 0.5 h,
and the FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer was used to record the fluorescence
intensity change at 583 nm (λexc = 559 nm).

Multiplex
DNA Simultaneous Detection
FAM DNA probe
(P1), TAMRA DNA probe (P2), and Cy5 DNA probe (P3) were first incubated
with 20 μL of 10 μM PDI at room temperature. After 10
min, DNA samples and 4 U of endonuclease Exo III were added to the
sample solution. Then, the mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for
0.5 h. The FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer was used to record the fluorescence
intensity change.

Results and Discussion
Design Strategy
A multiplexed bioassay platform was
constructed for simple, sensitive, and multiplex analysis of target
DNA sequences. The design scheme is shown in Figure 1. The 5′-end of the probe DNA (P1, P2, and P3, complementary
to target DNA T1, T2, and T3, respectively) is labeled with fluorophores
FAM, TAMRA, or Cy5. The perylene derivative (PDI) aggregates on the
probe and quenches the fluorescence of the fluorophores. Thus, the
fluorophore-labeled ssDNAs exhibit low fluorescence emission as a
result of their efficient quenching. Upon addition of the target ssDNA,
the fluorophore-labeled ssDNA probes hybridize to target DNA to form
duplex DNA structures with blunt-ended 3′-hydroxyl termini,
so that the duplex DNA structure will become the substrate for Exo
III cleavage. Then, Exo III catalyzes the stepwise removal of mononucleotides
from the blunt 3′ termini, resulting in the release of the
target and fluorophore. The released fluorophores are no longer quenched
by the aggregated perylene derivative, thus increasing the fluorescence
intensity. Because the duplex DNA probe can be stepwise removed by
Exo III, the target DNA is released and hybridizes with another fluorescently
labeled DNA, initiating the next round of cleavage. One target DNA
sequence can initiate numerous probe digestions, leading to a highly
sensitive DNA detection method. By monitoring the increase in fluorescence
intensity, the target can be detected with very high sensitivity.
Therefore, a multicolor sensor for analysis of multiple DNAs in homogeneous
solution can be developed when different probes with corresponding
fluorophores are used.

broad-spectrum
quencher with the Exo III-assisted enzymatic recycling amplification
strategy for amplified multiplexed analysis of DNA.

The fluorescence quenching ability of aggregated
PDI was first
investigated with the fluorophore-labeled ssDNA. As shown in Figure 2a, upon addition of PDI to the solution of fluorescein
FAM-, TAMRA-, or Cy5-labeled ssDNA (P1, P2, or P3), the fluorescence
intensity greatly decreased. More than 98% of FAM’s fluorescence
was quenched with 1.2 μM of PDI in the solution. The quenching
efficiencies on the fluorescence of FAM, TAMRA, and Cy5 could reach
to 98.3% ± 0.9%, 97 ± 1.1%, and 98.2% ± 0.6%, respectively.
This result reveals that aggregated PDI can efficiently quench the
fluorescence of fluorophores labeled on ssDNA. Moreover, the fluorescence
intensity reaches a steady value within only 2 min (Figure 2b), indicating the rapid aggregation and quenching
of PDI on ssDNA.

and
P3 (right) in the absence (red) and presence (black) of PDI. (b) Fluorescence
kinetics curves of 100 nM P1, P2, and P3 upon addition of 1 μM
of PDI. Lineweaver–Burk plots for 100 nM (c) P1 and (d) P2. F0 and F are the fluorescence
intensity of the fluorophore in the absence and presence of PDI, respectively.
The data for P1 are recoded with the excitation and emission wavelength
of 494 and 520 nm, respectively. The data for P2 are recoded with
the excitation and emission wavelength of 559 and 583 nm, respectively.

Fluorescence quenching usually
consists of static quenching and
dynamic quenching. Dynamic quenching can be described by Stern–Volmer’s
equation (eq 1), while static quenching can
be described by the Lineweaver–Burk equation (eq 2) 1   2  where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities
of the fluorophores in
the absence and in the presence of a quencher (aggregated PDI), respectively, cq is the concentration of the quencher, KSV is the dynamic quenching constant, and KLB is the static quenching constant.32−37 By increasing the concentration of aggregated PDI, the change of
fluorescence intensity for fluorophore-labeled ssDNA demonstrated
a linear Lineweaver–Burk plot (Figure 2c,d and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Thus, the fluorescence quenching followed a static quenching mechanism.
Moreover, the Stern–Volmer plot also showed good correlation,
indicating a dynamic quenching mechanism (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). Therefore, the fluorescence
quenching mechanism of PDI followed both static and dynamic processes.37,38 Since ssDNA is a polyanion, it can induce aggregation of the positively
charged aggregated PDI via electrostatic interactions. Therefore,
the quenching mechanism appears to be a function of the strong interaction
between aggregated PDI and DNA sequences, and under these conditions,
the fluorescence quenching of fluorophore-labeled DNA can be said
to occur by strong intermolecular hydrophobic and π–π
stacking interactions (Figure S3 in the Supporting
Information).

We further studied the behaviors of the
TAMRA DNA probe P2–PDI
complex in the absence and presence of target T2 by collecting the
fluorescence emission spectra. A 4.5-fold fluorescence increase was
detected upon addition of 100 nM target T2 (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). The pH effect of buffer
solution (50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl) on the affinities of aggregated
PDI toward ssDNA and dsDNA was also investigated. As shown in Figure
S5 in the Supporting Information, as pH
changed, the change of PDI affinity between ssDNA and dsDNA was negligible.
The different affinities of aggregated PDI toward ssDNA and dsDNA
broadened the opportunities for the application of aggregated PDI
in homogeneous fluorescence sensing of analytes.

In order to
achieve the best sensing performance, the concentrations
of perylene derivative and Exo III were optimized. Experimental results
showed that a concentration of 1.4 μM perylene derivative and
4 U of Exo III could provide maximum signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for
the sensing system (Figures S6 and S7 in the Supporting
Information), and these values were chosen as optimized conditions
for further investigation.

To assess the amplification function
of endonuclease, the target-induced
fluorescence enhancements in the presence and absence of exonuclease
III were then studied. The amplification assay was prepared by mixing
TAMRA DNA probe P2 with perylene derivative. Then target T2 (50 nM)
and Exo III (4 U) were added, and the mixture was incubated at 37
°C for 30 min. The exonuclease-assisted autocatalytic target
recycling amplification led to a dramatic increase in the final fluorescence
intensity upon the addition of the target T2. As shown in Figure 3A, in the absence of endonuclease, only a (210 ±
12)% signal increase was observed upon the addition of 50 nM target
T2. In contrast, under the same conditions, the introduction of exonuclease
III for signal amplification provided a (1446 ± 21)% fluorescence
enhancement. These results confirm that this assay can provide significant
signal amplification for DNA detection.

increase of the fluorescence signal with target T2 concentration of
50 nM. (B) Fluorescence spectra of assay systems with “postaddition”

and presence of target, respectively. The data were recorded with
excitation and emission wavelengths of 559 and 583 nm, respectively,
and from at least three independent experiments.

We next determined whether two approaches (preaddition and
postaddition)
would influence the accurate quantification of target DNA. An aliquot
of PDI suspension was first added to the solution containing the TAMRA
DNA probe P2, followed by adding target T2 and appropriate concentrations
of Exo III and incubating at 37 °C for 0.5 h. The above-mentioned
method is the postaddition approach. In contrast, a “pre-addition”
approach was also performed by first mixing P2 probe and target T2
(or control) with Exo III and then PDI was added after the completion
of the digestion reaction (Figure S8 in the Supporting
Information). Compared with the preaddition approach, the postaddition
approach is simple and easy to accomplish and could provide in situ and real-time information for targets. One can observe
that the fluorescence intensity increased gradually with the increasing
DNA concentration, irrespective of whether the postaddition (Figure 3B) or preaddition approach (Figure 4) were used. Figure 3C shows that the
dynamic range of the amplified sensing system was from 50 pM to 5
nM and that the detection limit was 20 pM (S/N = 3). Almost the same
detection limit for DNA detection was obtained from either of these
approaches, suggesting that the aggregated perylene derivative did
not affect the activity of the nucleases. Thus, we performed the postaddition
strategy in the experiments. A Pd nanowire with Exo III-assisted target
recycling, also using the postaddition approach for highly sensitive
nucleic acid detection, has been reported for DNA detection. However,
sensitivity is poor with a detection limit of only 0.3 nM. Compared
with other strategies used for homogeneous fluorescence multiplexed
detection of DNA, the perylene derivative-based assay shows shorter
assay time and a comparable, or even lower, detection limit (Table
S2, Supporting Information).

recorded with excitation and emission wavelengths of 559 and 583 nm,
respectively, and from at least three independent experiments.

In contrast, control experiments
for the biosensor with DNA at
various concentrations in the absence of endonuclease were also carried
out, with a detection limit of only 2 nM observed (Figure 5) and sensitivity almost 2 orders of magnitude poorer
than that of the Exo III-catalyzed amplified method. These results
indicate that the introduction of nuclease remarkably improved the
sensitivity of the biosensor.

at least three independent experiments.

To demonstrate that broad-spectrum quenching capability,
as herein
proposed, could be used for amplified multiplexed target detection
in a homogeneous solution, the multiplexed detection ability was further
investigated. Three probes, P1, P2, and P3, were labeled with FAM,
TAMRA, or Cy5, respectively. Significant dye-to-dye energy transfer
was avoided by choice of these three fluorophores, which were individually
excited at 494, 559, and 643 nm, emitting blue (520 nm), orange (583
nm), and red (670 nm) colors, respectively. Using PDI for multiple
fluorophores and Exo-III-assisted amplification, we could distinguish
highly similar DNA sequences and detect them simultaneously. It is
expected that fluorophore-labeled ssDNA probes hybridize to corresponding
target DNA to form a duplex DNA structure in the presence of the corresponding
target DNA. The addition of exonuclease induces the cleavage of the
corresponding fluorophore-labeled DNA probe, resulting in significant
fluorescence enhancement of the corresponding fluorophore (FAM, TAMRA,
or Cy5). As shown in Figure 6a, upon the addition
of target T1, signal increase was observed only in the FAM channels,
while a weak signal change was observed in the TAMRA and Cy5 channels.
The method could also be used for the specific detection of target
T2 or target T3 (Figure 6b). The simultaneous
detection of the two DNAs was also carried out. When target T2 and
target T3 were added to the mixed solution, the fluorescence enhancements
for both TAMRA and Cy5 channels were observed (Figure 6c). At the same time, the fluorescence intensity of FAM did
not change greatly. Therefore, our method can be used for simultaneous
detection of target T1 and target T2, target T1 and target T3, target
T2 and target T3 pairs, respectively. Moreover, when all targets were
present, fluorescence was observed in all three detection channels
(Figure 6d). The sensitivity and dynamic range
of the multiplexed sensing platform was also evaluated. Figure 7 represents the fluorescence intensity of the multiplexed
sensing platform toward target T1 and target T2 with different concentrations.
One can observe that the fluorescence intensity increased gradually
with the increase of target T1 and target T2 concentrations. Figure 7b shows that the dynamic range of the amplified
multiplexed sensing system for target T1 was from 50 pM to 10 nM and
that the detection limit was 20 pM (S/N = 3). Figure 7d shows that the dynamic range of the amplified multiplexed
sensing system for target T2 was from 50 pM to 5 nM and that the detection
limit was 20 pM (S/N = 3). These results clearly demonstrate the feasibility
of our strategy for multiplexed detection of DNA.

analysis of DNA. The measurement
conditions of FAM were excitation at 494 nm and emission at 520 nm.
The measurement conditions of TAMRA were excitation at 559 nm and
emission at 583 nm. The measurement conditions of Cy5 were excitation
at 645 nm and emission at 670 nm.

excitation and emission wavelengths of 559 and 583 nm, respectively.
The data for T2 were recorded with excitation and emission wavelengths
of 494 and 520 nm, respectively. Inset shows the responses of the
sensing system to DNA at low concentration. F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities of
the sensor in the absence and presence of target, respectively.

To investigate the specificity
of the sensing system, we compared
the fluorescence response induced by DNA strands containing single-base-
and two-base-mismatched oligonucleotides with that of target T2. All
results are displayed in Figure S9 in the Supporting
Information. It was found that the target DNA T2 with the perfectly
matched sequence induced 13-fold fluorescence enhancement. However,
4.6-fold and 2-fold fluorescence increase was observed when the DNA
targets contained single-base-mismatched and two-base-mismatched oligonucleotides,
respectively. These results demonstrated that this DNA sensing system
can be used to discriminate perfectly matched from mismatched DNA
targets.

In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that cationic
aggregated
and quenched perylene (PDI) can act as a broad-spectrum and label-free
quencher via strong electrostatic interactions. It efficiently quenches
a variety of adjacent anionic oligonucleotide-labeled fluorophores
that emit over a wide wavelength range from the visible to NIR region.
By combining aggregated perylene derivative broad-spectrum quenching
with the Exo III-assisted autocatalytic target recycling amplification
strategy, we proposed a sensitive and multiplexed analytical platform
with postaddition approach for target DNA detection. The quencher
did not interfere with the catalytic activity of the nuclease, and
the biosensor could be manipulated in either preaddition or postaddition
manner with similar sensitivity. High quenching efficiency combined
with autocatalytic target recycling amplification afforded the biosensor
high sensitivity toward target DNA. The present amplification sensing
system for the DNA detection has a dynamic range from 50 pM to 2.0
μM with a detection limit of 20 pM (S/N = 3), which is about
50-fold lower than that of traditional unamplified homogeneous assays.
Moreover, the biosensor could discriminate perfectly matched target
DNA from mismatched DNA. Simultaneous and multicolor analysis of several
oligonucleotides in homogeneous solution was also achieved by the
proposed sensing system, thus demonstrating its potential application
in the rapid screening of multiple biotargets.
