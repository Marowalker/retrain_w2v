We have developed a new method for
measuring the isotopic composition
(δ18O and δD) of different types of bonded
water (e.g., molecular water, hydroxyl) contained in hydrated minerals
by coupling a thermal gravimeter (TG) and a cavity ringdown laser
spectrometer (CRDS). The method involves precisely step-heating a
mineral sample, allowing the separation of the different types of
waters that are released at different temperatures. Simultaneously,
the water vapor evolved from the mineral sample is analyzed for oxygen
and hydrogen isotopes by CRDS. Isotopic values for the separate peaks
are calculated by integrating the product of the water amounts and
its isotopic values, after correcting for background. We provide examples
of the application of the differential thermal isotope analysis (DTIA)
method to a variety of hydrous minerals and mineraloids including
gypsum, clays, and amorphous silica (opal). The isotopic compositions
of the total water evolved from a set of natural gypsum samples by
DTIA are compared with the results of a conventional offline water
extraction method followed by CRDS analysis. The results from both
methods are in excellent agreement, and precisions (1σ) for
δ18O (±0.12‰) and δD (±0.8‰)
of the total gypsum hydration water from the DTIA method are comparable
to that obtained by the offline method. A range of analytical challenges
and solutions (e.g., spectroscopic interferences produced by VOCs
in natural samples, isotopic exchange with structural oxygen, etc.)
are discussed. The DTIA method has wide ranging applications for addressing
fundamental problems across many disciplines in earth and planetary
sciences, including paleoclimatology, sedimentology, volcanology,
water exchange between the solid earth and hydrosphere, and water
on Mars and other planetary bodies.

==== Body
Oxygen (16O,17O,18O) and hydrogen (H,D) isotopes of hydration
water in minerals provide powerful constraints on the conditions under
which these minerals form on Earth and other planetary bodies (e.g.,
Mars). High-precision measurements of hydrated minerals present three
major challenges: (i) hydrated minerals often hold multiple forms
of water of variable exchangeability and isotopic composition that
require separation prior to analysis; (ii) most natural samples are
of mixed mineralogy that are not readily separable by mechanical or
chemical means; and (iii) oxygen and hydrogen need to be converted
to, or in equilibration with, gaseous species for analysis on gas-source
isotope ratio mass spectrometer (typically CO2 for δ18O, O2 for 17O-excess, H2 for δD). Here we outline a new method that couples a thermal
gravimeter to a cavity ringdown laser spectrometer, thus allowing
for precise thermal separation and simultaneous online analysis that
bypasses the need for chemical conversion. We refer to the method
as “on-line differential thermal isotope analysis” (online
DTIA). General methodology is described with a focus on gypsum, a
relatively well-studied hydrated mineral, in order to provide information
on protocol, data processing requirements, accuracy, and precision.
Other mineral examples including kaolinite, montmorillonite, and opal
are used to describe some specific advantages and limitations of the
method.

Research on the isotopic composition of hydrous minerals
progressed
rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s following the advent of gas-source
isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). Pioneering work was carried
out on volcanic glass,1 gypsum,2 opal,3 clays,4−9 hydrous carbonates,10 and manganese hydroxides.11 Typically, water was extracted by heating in
vacuum followed by cryogenic trapping and finally conversion to, or
exchange with, H2 or CO2 gas (though most early
studies focused solely on hydrogen isotopes). In order to separate
different types of water within a given mineral, Knauth and Epstein,
in 1982, developed a method whereby a mineral (opal in particular)
was progressively heated in vacuum and water was trapped over discrete
temperature intervals for later analysis by IRMS.12 A quartz spring balance within the vacuum system allowed
the authors to monitor the mass loss over the course of the experiment.
The method was termed “differential thermal isotope analysis”
and has subsequently been adopted for a variety of hydrous mineral
studies. The downsides to the method include the laborious nature
of the trapping procedure (a typical experiment lasted over 8 h) and
the need for chemical conversion of the water to H2 or
CO2 gas.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, methods became
available for online
extraction of water and rapid conversion to gaseous species suitable
for continuous-flow mass spectrometry13,14 Using a high-temperature
(1450°C) glassy carbon furnace to simultaneously
dehydrate/dehyroxylate minerals and convert H2O vapor to
H2 and CO gas, Sharp et al., in 2001, demonstrated high-precision
measurements of δD of ±2‰ (1σ) on a variety
of hydrous minerals on samples containing about 0.1 μL of H2O.14 The method also showed promise
for the simultaneous analysis of δ18O (by peak-jumping
the IRMS to CO m/z) with precisions
of 0.2‰ (1σ), but this aspect of the method has been
less widely reported in the literature. Any differential thermal isotope
analysis with this method requires preheating the samples to remove
unwanted water followed by methods to prevent any absorption of atmospheric
water vapor prior to analysis. More specialized systems have also
been developed to study the hydrogen isotopes of nominally nonhydrous
geologic samples (e.g., meteorites) with precisions ranging from ±1
to 2‰ (1σ) on samples yielding as little as 1 ×
10–5 μL of H2O.15

More recently, the development of commercially available
laser
absorption spectrometers has offered another opportunity for technical
advancement. Offline extraction of gypsum hydration water followed
by CRDS analysis (Picarro i2140) has yielded high-precision measurements
of δ18O, δ17O, and δD with
1σ standard deviations of 0.13‰, 0.07‰, and 0.5‰,
respectively, for water samples of about 40 μL (200 mgs of gypsum).16 CRDS instruments have also been used in the
measurements of much smaller amounts of water released from fluid
inclusions in minerals (∼0.1–1.0 μL) with precision
better than ∼0.5‰ and 2‰ (1σ) for δ18O and δD, respectively.17−19 An online method using
off-axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy (Los Gatos Research
model 908-004), which focused on organic materials but reported some
gypsum measurements, demonstrated precisions of ±3–4‰
(1σ) for δD.20 Here we take
advantage of this recent advance in laser spectroscopy and revisit
the “differential thermal isotope analysis” method described
by Knauth and Epstein12 with state-of-the-art
instrumentation.

System Design
An overview schematic
of the online-DTIA system is provided in Figure 1. Samples are heated
in a thermal analysis system (Netzsch STA 449 F3 Jupiter) capable
of both thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC). The furnace can range between ambient temperature
and 1600° C with maximum ramp rates of 40 °C/min and the
possibility of precisely controlled plateaus. TGA provides continuous
data on changes in the mass of the sample with time and temperature.
DSC records small differences in the temperature of the sample and
a reference material, thus providing constraints on the enthalpy of
a phase transition or chemical reaction (i.e., endothermic or exothermic).
TGA and DSC are standard analytical techniques in earth sciences that
use characteristic thermal reactions for rapid and inexpensive mineral
identification.21

Figure 1 Online-DTIA system overview.
Upper panel: An image of the coupled
Netzsch thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) unit and Picarro L2130i
cavity ringdown spectrometer (CRDS). Lower panel: A schematic of the
system with an emphasis on the interface box. Solid black lines represent
1/8 in. stainless steel tubing, and green circles represent valves.

A sample is held in a crucible
that sits perched on a “carrier”
that connects to the balance, which is composed of an alumina stalk
housing the thermocouple and alumina baffle system. For samples smaller
than ∼20 mg, we typically use a TGA/DSC carrier, which has
a platinum platform that can hold a variety of crucibles (Al for temperatures
less than 600 °C, Pt or Al2O3 for higher
temperatures). Larger samples (up to 5 mL in volume) are analyzed
solely in TGA mode and are held in an Al2O3 crucible
that fits directly onto the carrier stalk.

The flow of gas can
be precisely manipulated by controllers in
the TG system to broadly match the flow required by the Picarro instrument,
(∼30 mL/min), although in practice we found that variability
in the flow rate of the Picarro on the order of hours to days can
lead to slight over- and underpressures within the balance system.
Underpressures are not problematic as the TG system is designed to
operate with pressure as low as 10–4 mBar (with
an attached turbmolecular pumping system not used in this study),
but large overpressures can potentially damage the balance. We employ
an open-split upstream of the TGA in the gas flow to prevent overpressures.
Generally, we use dry N2 as a carrier gas although some
experiments require the use of dry air (or an N2/O2 mixture) as a source of O2 when a catalyst is
employed to oxidize organic molecules (see below). Stock o-rings on
many of the seals in the TG system, likely of silicone and relatively
permeable to water, were replaced with Viton.

Downstream of
the TGA, water vapor is carried via a heated (120°C) 1/8 in. stainless steel tube to a heated (120 °C) interface system. The purpose of the interface box
is 3-fold: to switch between the autosampler and Netzsch without disrupting
the gas flow to either instrument; to house a cryogenic trapping system;
and to provide an optional catalyst for removal of impurities (e.g.,
VOCs) in the gas flow. The gas plumbing is composed primarily of 1/8
in. stainless steel tubing and Swagelok 3-way ball valves (40G series).
The vaporizer reservoir is a 50 cm3 stainless steel cylinder
(Swagekok part no. SS-4CD-TW-50). A “U” trap of 1/4
in. stainless steel tubing sits outside the box, jacketed in solid
copper, and heated with a PID controlled cartridge heater to 120 °C.
In trapping mode, the PID is set to −70 °C, and the copper
jacket is cooled by direct contact with liquid nitrogen. When a catalyst
is required, a 1/4 in. stainless steel tube containing a rare earth
catalyst and heated to over 200 °C is inserted immediately
upstream of the CRDS instrument (and downstream of the autosampler
junction). The catalyst material is sourced from an off-the-shelf
catalytic converter, which has proven to be as effective and cost-efficient.

A Picarro L-2130i provides continuous measurement of the H2O, δ18O, and δD of the water vapor
stream. No significant modifications of the analyzer were required
although we found it is important to analyze parameters such as the
“baseline shift” and “residual” to monitor
for contamination.

Analytical
Protocol
A sample is loaded into the TGA system manually,
and the furnace
tube is flushed with N2 (30 mL/min) for at least 15 min
or until water background returns to less than 100 ppm. A temperature
program is then started, and the TGA and Picarro water isotopes traces
are synchronized. Figure 2 shows an example of a gypsum dehydration profile with the
coupled TGA/DSC and Picarro data traces. In this case, gypsum was
placed in loosely sealed aluminum crucible to produce the two-step
dehydration from gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) to
bassananite (CaSO4·0.5H2O) to anhydrite
(CaSO4), which illustrates the ability of the system to
separate different bonded waters and simultaneous characterize them
for their mass loss, enthalpy, H2O, δ18O, and δD. As the sample is heated (5 °C min–1), the mineral dehydrates as evidenced by the mass loss and endothermic
reaction. The released water vapor is carried to the CRDS (transit
time ∼<1 min) where it is measured for H2O concentration,
δ18O, and δD. After analysis, the furnace is
cooled to near ambient temperature, and another sample may be loaded
immediately. Samples like gypsum, which require relatively low final
temperatures (∼200 °C), can be measured about
every 40 min. Samples requiring higher final temperatures (∼1000
°C) require at least a 90 min turn-around period.

transition
with the well-known double release of structural water. The weight
% and differential scanning calorimety (DSC) traces from the Netzsch
TGA/DSC are shown in the upper two panels. The lower panels show the
H2O, δ18O, and δD traces from the
Picarro CRDS.

Data Processing
Raw data output from the TGA/DSC and Picarro instruments are processed
with in-house Matlab code. Peak shoulders are defined on the basis
of the first derivate of the H2O trace. Background levels
of H2O and the isotopic values before and after the peak
are determined by a linear fit between the two intervals that is assumed
to represent the background H2O, δ18O,
and δD across the sample peak. Typically, background in the
instrument is low (∼50 ppm) relative to an ideal sample peak
height of ∼18 000 ppm. The background in the instrument
is sourced from lab air with some memory effects from prior samples
with δ18O and δD values of around −20‰
and −140‰, respectively. The magnitude of the correction
thus varies depending on both the sample amount and isotopic composition.
We treat this as a a preliminary correction that should be evaluated
on a case-by-case basis using a suite of known isotopic standards
of varying sample amounts (see section on Accuracy). Total H2O, δ18O, and δD are
calculated by integrating the H2O, δ18O, and δD traces and correcting them for background. Background
corrected values for δ18O and δD are then calibrated
using at least three working water standards (calibrated against SLAP,
GISP, and V-SMOW) that are injected multiple times into a vaporizer
following the approach outlined in Gazquez et al., in 2015.16

Gypsum Results:
Precision, Accuracy, and Linearity
We use gypsum as a means
to characterize the precision, accuracy,
and sensitivity of the online-DTIA method. First, we measured a suite
of natural and synthetic gypsum samples with a wide range of isotopic
values with both the online-DTIA method and an offline, in vacuum
total hydration water extraction system (the “WASP”).16,22 The WASP system requires sample amounts of around 200 mg of gypsum,
yielding 40 μL of water or enough to allow 10 syringe injections
of 2 μL each into the CRDS. We then measured the same samples
with the online-DTIA method. In comparison, the online-DTIA method
consumes only ∼7 mg of sample, thus yielding ∼1.4 μL
of water. The results of the comparison are shown in Figure 3 where the total gypsum hydration
water δ18O and δD from the “WASP”
method are plotted against the results from the online-DTIA method.
In the δ18O comparison, a linear regression yielded
a slope, intercept, and root-mean-square error of 1.03, 0.06, and
0.35‰, respectively; the δD comparison produces a slope,
intercept and root-mean-square error values of 0.96, −2.41,
and 1.3‰, respectively. The comparison demonstrates that, with
a reduction in sample size of over an order of magnitude, the online-DTIA
method can accurately determine the isotopic composition of GHW across
a wide range of values to within about 0.4‰ and 1.3‰
for δ18O and δD, respectively.

accuracy. Plots of total gypsum hydration
water δ18O and δD in natural and synthetic
samples gypsum from a high-precision, offline vacuum extraction technique
(Gazquez et al., 2015) and the online-DTIA technique (this study).
The black solid lines represent the 1:1 line of coincidence between
the two methods.

In the online-DTIA method
there is always a trade-off between the
sample peak height and width. For a given sample size faster heating
ramps will produce higher but narrower peaks, whereas slower heating
ramps will produce lower but broader peaks. Although instrumental
response of the Picarro is considered to be relatively linear and
precise down to 2500 ppm (quoted precision at 2500 ppm of 0.08‰
for δ18O and 0.50‰ for δD over a 100
s integration time in the Picarro gray literature), it has been shown
that this should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.23,24 In the online-DTIA, other effects could include the contributions
from the background, any additional absorbed water on the surface
of the furnace tube, and any nonlinear response of the measured δ18O and δD to changing water vapor concentration, particularly
across the “shoulders” of the peak when H2O is less than 2500 ppm. To characterize these potential effects
we made repeated measurements of one homogeneous gypsum sample of
known isotope composition across a range of sample sizes and heating
ramp rates. This allows us to characterize the reproducibility and
measurement linearity across a range of total water extracted and
peak height. The results, plotted against total water released (0.09–2.4
μL) and broken down by heating ramp rate (5–40 °C per minute) are shown in Figure 4.

size dependence.
Plots of total integrated water, peak height, and the precision and
accuracy of δ18O and δD from an internal gypsum
standard “NEWGYP” (δ18O = 0.45‰;
δD = −51‰, indicated by horizontal gray bars).
Experiments were carried out with variable sample sizes and heating
ramp rates to quantify their effect on precision and accuracy. The
gray shades represent the mean values (±1σ) of the same
standard obtained by the offline extraction followed by CRDS analysis
(Gazquez et al., 2015).16

The measured δ18O and δD
values are relatively
stable above 1 μL with means and 1σ standard deviations
of 0.58 ± 0.12‰ and −54.9 ± 0.8‰, respectively.
Between 0.5 and 1 μL, δ18O remains stable (0.63
± 0.07‰) but δD begins to systematic trend toward
negative values (−57.6 ± 1.1‰). Between 0.2 and
0.5 μL, δ18O becomes noisier (0.46 ± 0.18‰),
and δD falls precipitously toward negative values (−62.7
± 2.5‰). One sample below 0.1 μL is very depleted.
Trends in error (both random and systematic) appear to correlate most
strongly with sample size amount and are relatively insensitive to
peak height between 5000 and 30 000 ppm, suggesting the method
is limited by sample size amount. The most robust data will come from
samples yielding above 1.0 μL of H2O with ramp rates
that produce peak heights of 10 000–20 000 ppm.
Within this range, the 1σ standard deviations for δ18O and δD are ±0.12‰ and ±0.8‰,
respectively. Samples yielding between 0.2 and 1.0 μL should
be run alongside known standards to account for systematic errors.

Kaolonite
and Montmorillonite: High-Temperature Dehydroxylation Examples
In addition to providing precise and routine isotopic measurements
on relatively small samples, a significant innovation of the system
is the capability of separating different types of bonded water. Here
we report preliminary measurements of the isotopic composition of
samples of kaolinite (source: Blackpool Pit, St. Austell pluton, Cornwall,
UK25) and montmorillonite (source: Clay
Minerals Society Stx-1b). Kaolinite, Al2Si2O5(OH)4, is a simple clay with only bonded hydroxyl,
thus allowing us to compare the online-DTIA method to an offline technique.
Montmorillonite, (Na,Ca)0.33(Al,Mg)2(Si4O10)(OH)2·nH2O, is a clay with both interlayer water and bonded hydroxyl,
a more representative example of water found in phyllosilicates. Examples
of the weight %, H2O, δ18O, and δD
traces are shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Kaolinite and montmorillonite examples. A comparison of the kaolinite
(orange) dehydroxylation centered around 450 °C and the montmorillonite
interlayer and absorbed water dehydration around 150 °C and dehydroxylation
which peaks around 600 °C.

Kaolinite undergoes dehydroxylation from ∼450 to 650 °C, producing a relatively symmetric peak in H2O (note the mass increase at 300 °C is an uncorrected artifact
from an increase in the temperature ramp rate). On the basis of four
replicate measurements with the online-DTIA system, the δ18O and δD of the hydroxyl water are +6.63 ± 0.7‰
and −62.2 ± 0.7‰, respectively. These results agree,
within error, with those offline in vacuum extractions (n = 5) of significantly larger samples in our laboratory (δ18O = +5.8 ± 0.5‰ and δD = −62.6 ±
3.7‰) and δD determined by early offline extraction and
gas-source mass spectrometry techniques (δD = −62‰).25 This demonstrates that water extraction at high
temperature with the online-DTIA method is free of any significant
errors with respect to previously established methodologies.

Montmorillonite shows a highly convolved double peak from ∼100
to 200 °C from interlayer and absorbed water with
both δ18O and δD trending toward enriched values.
From 200 to 500 °C, the sample continues to slowly lose mass
(∼0.003 wt %/°C). This leads to elevated
water vapor levels between 2000 and 3000 ppm. Dehydroxylation appears
to begin around 500 °C with a significant acceleration
of water loss between 600 and 700 °C. In cases like this, an
isothermal interval can be employed to increase separation between
peaks. Using this technique (not shown), replicate measurements (n = 4) constrain the δ18O and δD
of the hydroxyl peak to +13.42 ± 0.13‰ and −41.6
± 0.6‰, respectively. This demonstrates the possibility
for high-precision measurements of clay minerals. Attempts to separate
and measure the hydroxyl water with offline extraction proved unsuccessful,
highlighting the utility of the online-DTIA method but limiting our
ability to access the accuracy of the online-DTIA method.

Hydration
Water in Opal: Contamination from Organics and Carbonate
Opal is an example of a hydrated mineral with a large amount of
absorbed and/or loosely bonded H2O (∼>5 wt %)
relative to hydroxyl (<1%). Moreover, the H2O and OH
peaks are highly convolved. Nonetheless, opal is an attractive mineral
to study given its widespread occurrence in the geologic record. During
the course of experimentation with natural samples (primarily diatomaceous
oozes from deep ocean cores and terrestrial diatomites), we have identified
three possible limitations of the online-DTIA method that require
evaluation on a case-by-case basis.

Volatilized organic molecules
can interfere with the infrared spectra
of water isotopes when using CRDS, leading to erroneous isotopic data
that is typically too enriched.26 Organic
carbon pyrolysis and subsequent spectral interference can be monitored
by a close comparison of the mass loss (from the TGA), cumulative
H2O released (from the CRDS), and CRDS parameters for spectral
contamination (baseline shift, baseline curvature, residual, CH4). Intervals of mass loss without a corresponding release
of H2O can be flagged as potentially contaminated and discarded.
To illustrate this a comparison of a raw opal sample and a sample
cleaned with H2O2 is shown in Figure 6. In the raw sample, excess
mass loss in the contaminated sample of about 1 wt % is observed from
450 to 500 °C. Simultaneous increases in the spectral “residual”
(or baseline shift, not shown) and fluctuations in the δ18O trace point toward problematic contamination. Additional
measures can be taken to mitigate the effect of organic contamination
through the use of an air carrier gas in conjunction with a rare earth
catalyst to promote the oxidization of organic molecules to CO2 and H2O.16 Future work
could explore using laser spectrometers that utilize significantly
different wavelengths than the Picarro CRDS and thus avoid this potentially
problematic contamination.

Figure 6 Organic contamination in biogenic silica samples.
An example of
an opal sample dehydroxylation when organic matter contamination undergoes
pyrolysis (green lines). Organic content of this sample is about 1
wt % as shown with the additional around 450 °C
without any corresponding increase in H2O. For comparison,
the same sample was treated with H2O2 to remove
organic matter prior to heating (blue). Note the increase in the spectrum
residual during pyrolysis that can act as a flag for contamination.

Many natural geologic samples
contain carbonate minerals and thus
undergo calcination above about 700 °C (reaction: CaCO3 → CaO + CO2). Nascent CO2 and H2O released at high temperature is capable of rapid oxygen
isotope exchange,27 although the two gas
species likely need a surface or catalyst to promote the reaction.
Given that the oxygen isotope fractionation during the conversion
of CaCO3 to CO228 and exchange between CO2 and H2O29 are small at high temperature, an observed δ18O–H2O trace subject to exchange with CO2 sourced from carbonate will broadly approach the isotopic
composition of carbonate substrate. With most terrestrial carbonates
enriched in 18O, on the order of ∼ +30‰ VSMOW,
the δ18O–H2O trace will typically
erroneously climb toward enriched values during calcination. Figure 7 shows an example
of terrestrial diatomite containing trace amount of CaCO3 (∼1 wt %) both before and after acidification with HCl. Calcination
around 700 °C leads to enrichments of +2–3‰. When
possible, samples should be treated with weak acid to remove carbonates,
but tests with isotopically spiked acid solutions must be carried
to check for the possibility of isotopic exchange during acidification.

Figure 7 Carbonate
contamination. Examples of opal dehydroxylation both
with (green) and without (blue) the presence of trace CaCO3. One opal sample contained at least 1 wt % CaCO3 as noted
by the additional anomalous mass loss above about 700 °C. This carbonate would be very enriched in δ18O
(+30‰, VSMOW) and would produce CO2 gas upon calcination.
The anomalous increase in δ18O of the contaminated
sample above about 700 °C is attributed to exchange between the
nascent H2O and CO2.

Future work to quantify the amount and isotopic composition
of
CO2 produced from calcination could be made by incorporating
a CO2 isotope CRDS downstream of the H2O isotope
CRDS or using a combined CO2 and H2O isotope
analyzer.30 Simultaneous measurement could
provide the means to constrain the isotopic exchangeability of CO2 and H2O during an experiment. Additionally, continuous
measurement of the concentration and isotopes of CO2 produced
at high temperature from carbonate minerals would allow a re-evaluation
of the thermal decarbonization method as a means for measuring the
isotopic composition of carbonate minerals.31,32

Potential
for Oxygen Isotope Exchange at High Temperature
The oxygen
isotopic composition of the hydrous components of minerals
is less-frequently studied and reported compared to the hydrogen isotopic
composition. This is in part due to concerns about oxygen isotopic
exchange between the hydrous and nonhydrous oxygen during high-temperature
dehydroxylation. In the case of opal, we observed clear evidence that
a sample can undergo isotopic exchange between water vapor and nonhydrous
oxygen upon heating. Tests with other minerals are underway but do
not provide such clear evidence, and as such, opal may be a particular
case owing to the amorphous structure of the silicate and hydroxyl
bonds. A series of experiments with quartz and opal are presented
in Figure 8. First,
we heated a (nonhydrous) quartz sample to 1000 °C in the dry
N2 gas stream in the TGA. After cooling back to room temperature,
the dry N2 gas flow was replaced with combined N2 and water vapor stream (H2O = 5000 ppm; δ18O = −19‰; δD = −140‰). The sample
was reheated in the presence of this wet gas stream. No change in
δD is observed, but δ18O begins to climb slowly
between 600 and 1000 °C to reach a maximum of −14‰.
The shift toward enriched values could be due to interactions of the
H2O with an enriched oxygen source. Possible sources include
the following: the quartz sample (natural range +5–15‰),
Al2O3 that makes up the crucible and furnace
tube (+5–15‰)33 or trace
amounts of atmospheric O2 in the gas stream (+23.5‰).34

Figure 8 Possible oxygen isotope exchange. A series of experiments
to demonstrate
the potential of oxygen isotope exchange at high temperature. First,
a sample of quartz was heated under dry N2 to 1000 °C (not shown). After cooling to room temperature a stream
of H2O vapor (H2O = 5000 ppm; δ18O = −19‰; δD = −140‰ as indicated
by gray horizontal bars) was added to the N2 stream. The
quartz sample was reheated to 1000 °C, and the H2O,
δ18O, and δD traces were monitored (blue line).
The same experiment was repeated with an opal sample, first by heating
the raw samples (black line) and then by imposing a water background
over the now dehydrated samples (red line). Increase in the δ18O trace during the water background experiments may indicate
exchange between H2O and an enriched source.

The same experiment was then repeated with a biogenic
silica sample
in place of the quartz. The sample is a terrestrial diatomite of quaternary
age from central Oregon35 (local meteoric
water δ18O ∼−13.5‰; mean annual
temperature ∼+8°C). The δ18O of the nonhydrous oxygen of this sample is not precisely known
but based on possible fractionation factors probably ranges between
20‰ and 28‰.

During the dehydroxylation of the
sample from ∼400 to 600
°C, δ18O plateaus at about +7‰ and δD
slowly trends to background values (the peak in δ18O around 400°C is an example of organic contamination
with an inert carrier gas and no catalyst). Upon reheating under a
H2O/N2 mix atmosphere we again observe no shifts
in the δD trace but a much larger shift in δ18O. The δ18O begins to increase around 300 °C
and reaches a maximum of +5‰ by 1000 °C.
This shift is comparable to the change in δ18O observed
during dehydroxylation of the same sample.

These experiments
suggest that the system is free of any significant
contamination or exchange with respect to hydrogen isotopes. Oxygen
isotope measurements, however, could be significantly biased, possibly
through exchange with isotopically enriched oxygen. This is not surprising
given that the extraction system and the mineral samples are free
of any nonhydrous hydrogen isotope sources, but nonhydrous oxygen
is present in abundance. For example, a typical biogenic opal sample
may hold about ∼10 wt % H2O, ∼1 wt % OH,
and ∼42 wt % nonhydrous oxygen. Overall, the results suggest
that minerals that dehydroxylate at high temperature should be evaluated
for possible oxygen isotope exchange.

Conclusions
We
have demonstrated a new method for measuring the isotopic composition
of multiple forms of bonded water in hydrous minerals. The method
simultaneously provides δ18O and δD data at
precisions of 0.12‰ and 0.8‰, respectively. These precisions
are comparable to those of previous methodologies for natural samples,
if not a slight improvement (see Table 1 for comparison). However, the new method requires
about 1 μL of water and is thus a slight compromise on sample
size, in particular compared to online-IRMS methods capable of measurements
of only 0.1 μL of water. Compared to offline differential thermal
separation, the online-DTIA is significantly less labor intensive.
The instrumental setup also requires much lower capital and consumables
costs compared to methods utilizing gas-source mass spectrometers.

The primary advantage of the method is the ability
to rapidly characterize
the wt % and isotopic composition of multiple forms of bonded H2O or bonded OH in a sample. By separating these different
forms of water, factors that control the isotopic composition of the
water species, such as isotopic fractionation during formation and
postdepositional exchangeability, can now be studied. The same principle
could also provide a way to separate water from different minerals
in natural samples of mixed mineralogy.

The presence of organic
matter, carbonate minerals, or exchangeable
(nonhydrous) oxygen may effect the δ18O measurement
on minerals that undergo water loss at high temperature (∼>400°C). Minerals that undergo dehydration at relatively
low temperature (e.g., gypsum, trona, nahcolite, and many other evaporite
minerals) are likely free of these problems.
