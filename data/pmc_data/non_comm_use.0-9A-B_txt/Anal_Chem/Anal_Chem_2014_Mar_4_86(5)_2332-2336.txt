The concentration
of human serum albumin (HSA) indicates the health
state of individuals and is routinely measured by UV spectroscopy
with bromocresol. However, this method tends to overestimate HSA,
and more critically, depends highly on the timing, in seconds, of
the measurements. Here, we report an analog of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein
that can be used as a fluorescent sensor to quantify HSA in human
sera. The accuracy of this new method proved superior to that of bromocresol
when an international standard serum sample was analyzed. This method
is more convenient than the bromocresol method because it allows for
fluorescence measurements during a >15 min period. Colorimetric
analysis
was also performed to further investigate the effects of the binding
of the sensor to HSA. These spectroscopic studies suggest that absorption
and emission changes upon HSA binding may be due to the dehydration
of the dye and/or stabilization of the tritylic cation species.

==== Body
Albumin is a large globular
protein found in large abundance in human sera.1 It serves many functions, including the binding of exogenous
species, which may provide a detoxification mechanism.1,2 Quantification of albumin is clinically important, as it has been
found to be an effective prognostic indicator. Human serum albumin
(HSA) levels are typically ∼50 g/L (∼0.75 mM) for healthy
individuals. A significant decrease in serum albumin is currently
used in the staging system for multiple myeloma,3 mortality,4 and cognitive impairment
prediction in the elderly5 and is also
used as an indicator for coronary heart disease.6 Extremely low HSA concentrations (below 1 g/L) define analbuminemia,
a rare congenital disorder.7 Thus quantifying
HSA, especially in low concentrations, is of great significance.

HSA is currently measured using colorimetric techniques such as
bromocresol8 green (BCG)9−11 or bromocresol
purple.12−14 Among the shortcomings of the bromocresol method
is the overestimation of albumin, especially in low concentrations.15−18 This is alarming because the overestimation of albumin overlooks
the aforementioned illness and poor prognosis. Even more significantly,
the bromocresol method is highly time-sensitive; albumin concentrations
are overestimated after 30 s of incubation because the dye begins
to react with other proteins.19,20 The time sensitivity
poses a technical problem, rendering it difficult to develop a bromocresol-based
high throughput assay to measure albumin in parallel. Additionally,
at-home kits that would be available to the general public cannot
be easily developed. New methods to measure serum proteins continue
to be reported in recent years,21,22 but the time sensitivity
of the bromocresol-based method has not yet been resolved.

Here,
we present a new fluorescence method that allows for the
quantitative measurement of HSA. The on–off fluorescent sensor
can readily be available via a one-step chemical synthesis.23 The assay protocol is simple, with a fluorometer
or fluorescence plate reader as the only instrument. The method is
not time sensitive, an advantage for potential high throughput screenings
and reproducibility.

We previously reported a fluorescence method
to detect ozone in
biofluid samples.24 In this method, the
fluorescent reporter was the 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein
(DCF) derivative 1 (Figure 1).
In this previous work, we successfully demonstrated that the method
could detect a high concentration of ozone with compound 1 as the reporter in a tissue culture media.24 However, it was later found that a minute amount of ozone could
not be detected in serum (data not shown). We hypothesized that compound 1 might be bound to biomacromolecule(s) in the tissue culture
media and that its fluorescence was quenched by forming the spirocyclic
form of compound 1. To test this hypothesis, the fluorescence
of compound 1 was measured in serum-containing pH 7 phosphate
buffer and found to be quenched (data not shown). After removing the
total proteins from the serum, the quenching effect was absent (data
not shown). It was concluded that serum protein(s) were responsible
for the quenching.

Figure 1 Structures of fluorescein derivatives used in this study.

Albumin is the most abundant protein
in serum, prompting us to
hypothesize that albumin caused the fluorescence quenching. To test
this hypothesis, the fluorescence of 1 was measured in
the presence of HSA in a pH 7 phosphate buffer. As Figure 2a shows, the fluorescence signal decreased in the
presence of HSA. In order to probe the structure-dependence of the
fluorescence quenching, we tested closely related compounds. The fluorescence
of DCF was also quenched by HSA to a similar extent. Compound 2(25) was quenched by HSA by a slightly
larger degree. In order to determine the effect of the chloride groups
of 1, the previously prepared nonchloro fluorescein derivative 3(26) was tested and found to be
less responsive than the corresponding dichlorinated derivative 1. This result indicates the importance of the chlorides for
HSA binding.

Figure 2 (a) Quenching effect of HSA on fluorescein derivatives
(triplicate).
(b) Effect of pH 7 buffer components on HSA detection with Pittsburgh
Green II (triplicate).

At this stage, we hypothesized that DCF and compounds 1, 2, and 3 could be quenched by
protonation
on the phenolic hydroxy group or spirocyclization (Figure 1, equilibrium for 1). Compound 4(23) cannot form a spirocyclic structure
and, thus, was considered a desirable probe for use in studying the
effect of the spirocyclization. We found that this compound was quenched
by HSA more prominently than 1. This result excludes
the spirocyclization as a fluorescence quenching mechanism and indicates
that the methyl group is preferable over the hydroxymethyl group on
the upper phenyl ring for HSA binding. Compound 5 was
less responsive than 4 to HSA. From these studies, compound 4 (Pittsburgh Green II) emerged as an optimal fluorescent
sensor for HSA.

Thus far, all fluorescence measurements were
carried out in a phosphate
pH 7 buffer, as this buffer was used to study fluorescein-HSA binding
in the past.21,27 We asked whether phosphate buffers
were optimal for HSA-Pittsburgh Green II binding. To answer this question,
we screened three commonly used pH 7 buffers (Figure 2b). Pittsburgh Green II was more responsive to HSA in a pH
7 HEPES buffer than in pH 7 phosphate or Tris buffers. Thus, the rest
of this study was performed in a pH 7 HEPES buffer.

Next, we
set out to determine whether Pittsburgh Green II could
be used as a quantitative fluorescent sensor for HSA. As Figure 3a shows, the green fluorescence signal correlated
with the concentration of HSA in a pH 7 HEPES buffer. A linear relationship
was observed over a concentration range of 2–10 mg/L. This
range is far lower than that of the traditional bromocresol method
(100–300 mg/L),28 indicating superior
sensitivity.

The data were normalized. (d) Pittsburgh Green II can be photobleached
when frequently monitored.

We critically pondered whether the fluorescence change could
quantify
HSA in a time-insensitive manner. The green fluorescence signal was
remarkably stable for at least 16 min in the presence of HSA (Figure 3, panels b and c). It should be noted that the signal
initially decreased for the first 10 min without HSA when measured
every minute, after which the background signal was stable. The initial
background signal decrease was caused by photobleaching during the
frequent excitation of the fluorophore, as indicated in Figure 3d. When HSA-containing samples were monitored over
30 min, the apparent concentration of HSA, as determined by the difference
between fluorescence signals with and without HSA at each time point,
changed as shown in Figure 3c. Notably, there
is a substantial period of time (between 14 and 30 min) during which
the apparent HSA concentration was essentially unchanged. In contrast,
the apparent concentration of HSA using the BCG method rapidly changed
around the recommended time (30 s). The study on the BCG method by
Gustafsson showed that this widely used method could overestimate
the HSA concentration by more than 12% in the first 90 s.20 Our method provides a greater range of time
points to measure HSA concentrations accurately, allowing the preparation
and measurement of many samples in parallel.

In order to assess
the accuracy of the Pittsburgh Green II-based
method for quantifying HSA in human serum, we compared this method
with the BCG method by using a certified reference material human
serum standard (ERM-DA470k/IFCC) whose HSA concentration was determined
to be 36.9 ± 1.2 g/L as the average of many analytical methods.29 This sample was diluted by 200 fold for the
BCG method and by 4000 fold for our method; because our method is
1 order of magnitude more sensitive than the BCG method, we diluted
the samples accordingly to adjust the concentration of HSA to the
linear range. The BCG method and our method indicated that the HSA
concentration was 43.8 ± 1.3 and 36.5 ± 1.7 g/L, respectively,
by one coauthor, and was 44.9 ± 3.6 and 38.9 ± 2.7 g/L,
respectively, by another coauthor. In both cases, the bromocresol
green method resulted in a significant difference from the accepted
value at the 95% confidence level. There was no significant difference
noticed for the Pittsburgh Green II method; therefore, this method
proved to be more accurate than the BCG method for quantifying HSA
in the standard human serum sample. The tendency for the BCG method
to give higher HSA concentrations in sera was further corroborated
when another commercial human serum sample was used; the BCG method
and the Pittsburgh Green II method showed 57.4 ± 2.0 and 49.6
± 2.0 g/L, respectively.

When HSA (125 μg; equivalent
of 2.5 μL of human serum
with 50 g/L HSA) was added to a pale yellow-green Pittsburgh Green
II solution (1 mM, 2.0 mL), the solution turned red under ambient
light (Figure 4a). Titration of human serum
to a Pittsburgh Green II solution indicates a red shift in the absorption
spectra (λmax: 501 to 514 nm; Figure 4b) and emission spectra (λmax: 522 to 534
nm; Figure 4c). Addition of HSA showed the
same trend. As we stated above, we hypothesized that HSA-bound Pittsburgh
Green II was protonated. To compare the HSA-bound dye and protonated
dye, the solution of the dye was treated with acid; upon acidification,
Pittsburgh Green II showed weaker absorption first and then a red
shift (λmax: 502 to 538 nm; Figure 4d). The acid-mediated red shift is highly unusual for xanthenone-based
compounds, as DCF (Figure 4e) and 1 (Pittsburgh Green)25 exhibited blue shifts
in absorption spectra.

of Pittsburgh Green II in organic solvents. The data are normalized
for 10 μM Pittsburgh Green II.

To further gain insights into the color change, we examined
the
solvatochromism of Pittsburgh Green II; a red shift was observed from
MeOH (λmax 512 nm) to DMSO (λmax 532 nm) as a solvent (Figure 4f). Taken together,
the addition of HSA to Pittsburgh Green II in water appears to protonate
and/or dehydrate the dye (analogous to MeOH → DMSO), causing
the red shift. The dehydration may account for fluorescence quenching,
as fluorescein and DCF in the gas phase are essentially nonfluorescent.33,34

What is responsible for the unusual red shifts caused by HSA
and
acid? To address this question, we first discuss the protonation states
of Pittsburgh Green II (4) (Figure 5). Upon acidification of a solution of 4, the 4 + H form is generated. Further acidification generates the
cationic species 4 + 2H+. This
cationic species would not be observed with DCF or 1 because
an oxygen atom on the upper phenyl ring will react with the carbocation
to form a spirocyclic structure. Pittsburgh Green II does not contain
a nucleophilic atom on the upper phenyl ring and thus can exist as
the cationic species 4 + 2H+ under
acidic conditions. The HSA-bound Pittsburgh Green II may possess the
character of 4 + 2H+ as well.
The presence of an isosbestic point shown in Figure 4b indicates that the binding of Pittsburgh Green II with HSA
is reversible, supporting both hypotheses.35

In summary, we solved the long-standing problem associated
with
the BCG method by developing a new fluorometric method for HSA. The
new method proved accurate and reproducible with the international
standard serum sample, and the time-insensitivity provides a high-throughput
means to measure HSA. This new method is >30 times more sensitive
than the BCG method; the superior sensitivity may be exploited in
the diagnosis of individuals with analbuminemia. An unusual red shift
of a xanthenone derivative was discovered and caused by HSA and acid.
