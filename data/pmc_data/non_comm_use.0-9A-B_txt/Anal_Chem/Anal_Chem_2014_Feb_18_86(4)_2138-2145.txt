Here we implement ultraviolet photodissociation
(UVPD) in an online
liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) strategy to
support analysis of complex mixtures of lipid A combinatorially modified
during development of vaccine adjuvants. UVPD mass spectrometry at
193 nm was utilized to characterize the structures and fragment ion
types of lipid A from Escherichia coli, Vibrio
cholerae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using
an Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The fragment ions generated by UVPD
were compared to those from collision induced dissociation (CID) and
higher energy collision dissociation (HCD) with respect to the precursor
charge state. UVPD afforded the widest array of fragment ion types
including acyl chain C–O, C–N, and C–C bond cleavages
and glycosidic C–O and cross ring cleavages, thus providing
the most comprehensive structural analysis of the lipid A. UVPD exhibited
virtually no dependence on precursor ion charge state and was best
at determining lipid A structure including acyl chain length and composition,
giving it an advantage over collision based methods. UVPD was incorporated
into an LC–MS/MS methodology for the analysis of a number of
structural variants in a complex mixture of combinatorially engineered Escherichia coli lipid A.

==== Body
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) constitutes
the outermost layer of the cell membrane in most gram-negative bacteria.
LPS is amphiphilic in nature, containing a hydrophilic polysaccharide
chain and a hydrophobic membrane anchor known as lipid A. Also called
endotoxin, lipid A is typically composed of a bis-phosphorylated diglucosamine
with a variable number of amide and ester-linked fatty acid chains.
Lipid A is integral to the innate immune response to gram-negative
bacteria as it is the moiety of LPS recognized by the mammalian Toll-like
receptor 4 (TLR4), which triggers a signaling cascade leading to pro-inflammatory
cytokine production.1 These immunological
events initiated by lipid A recognition are important for clearing
infection; however, hyperstimulation or overamplification of the immune
response can lead to septic shock.2,3

Biosynthesis
of lipid A proceeds through a well-conserved biochemical
pathway. The resultant molecule can be remodeled by various modification
enzymes (such as LpxE, LpxF, PagP, PagL, or ArnT) which alter the
glycosylation and phosphorylation patterns and number of acyl chains
observed in lipid A structure across various gram-negative bacterial
species.3 The fine chemical structure of
lipid A is paramount to TLR4 activation and the downstream inflammatory
response. Comprehensive investigations of the causal relationship
between lipid A structures and affiliated immune response have led
to the development of lipid A based vaccines. In particular the production
of a vaccine adjuvant using monophosphorylated lipid A from Salmonella minnesota induces a sufficient immune response
without overproduction of inflammatory cytokines.4 More recently, a combinatorial engineering approach generated
61 Escherichia coli strains producing unique lipid
A profiles that varied in phosphorylation and acyl chain patterns.5 These varied structures induced a broad spectrum
of innate immune response and showed promise as new E. coli-based vaccine adjuvants. The heterogeneity and structural diversity
of lipid A molecules within a bacterial sample poses a significant
analytical challenge in chemical characterization of complex lipid
A mixtures and impedes their development as vaccine adjuvants.

Mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as one of the premier tools
for elucidation of lipid A structures.6,7 The amphiphilic
nature of lipid A species makes them particularly difficult to separate
and ionize. Early analysis of lipid A utilized 252Cf plasma-desorption
mass spectrometry (PD-MS)8−10 and fast atom bombardment mass
spectrometry (FAB-MS),11,12 but both methods have been replaced
by matrix assisted laser desperation ionization (MALDI) and electrospray
ionization (ESI).13−31 More recently Yoon et al. demonstrated surface acoustic wave nebulization
(SWAN), which was utilized for the ionization of both glycolipids
and lipid A and alleviates MALDI matrix effects and emitter clogging
during nanoESI.32 Once ionized, diagnostic
fragmentation patterns for structural characterization and differentiation
of lipid A molecules are often difficult to interpret. Collision induced
dissociation (CID) has proven to be the benchmark tandem mass spectrometry
(MS/MS) technique for elucidation of several gram-negative lipid A.13−32 However, CID tends to selectively cleave the most labile bonds,
which frequently results in an insufficient number of fragment ions
and prevents fragmentation at important lipid A modification sites.
This shortcoming is more commonly observed for multiply deprotonated
lipid A species,18 which is especially
problematic in the negative mode for those lipid A molecules decorated
with acidic modifications on the glucosamine sugars. Since low energy
CID does not always provide sufficient fragmentation, other MS/MS
strategies have been explored19,20,33 as well as MSn methods which provide
both genealogical insight about consecutive fragmentation pathways
as well as hierarchical information useful for deeper characterization
of lipid A structures and modifications.17−31 The use of MSn methods are less amenable
to high throughput liquid chromatography (LC)–MS applications
and require more elaborate processing for data interpretation. We
have recently explored the use of photodissociation methods, including
infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) and ultraviolet photodissociation
(UVPD), for the characterization of lipid A.33−37 UVPD led to the production of an impressive array
of diagnostic fragment ions that facilitated mapping of unique modifications.33−37 UVPD has gained widespread acceptance as a frontier higher energy
MS/MS technique that rivals or in some cases outperforms conventional
CID methods for both broad profiling of biopolymers and more selective
chromophore-mediated approaches.33−35,38−57 UVPD has been applied to a wide range of bioanalytes including nucleic
acids,40−43 peptides and proteins,44−52 glycans and oligosaccharides,53,54 and more recently lipids55−58 and lipid A molecules.33−37

In this study, we present a systematic MS/MS comparison of
singly
and doubly charged lipid A using CID, HCD, and UVPD on an Orbitrap
mass spectrometer for analysis of strains of lipid A from wild types E. coli, Vibrio cholerae, and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. We demonstrate that UVPD, unlike CID and HCD,
does not exhibit a significant charge state dependence on the formation
of informative fragment ions. We also report a high-throughput LC–UVPD-MS/MS
method to separate and analyze low abundance but biologically relevant
lipid A variants from engineered E. coli strain BN2
expressing key phosphatase, deacylase, and acyltransferase enzymes
LpxE, PagL, and PagP, respectively, to aid in the development of new
lipid A-based adjuvants in vaccines.

Experimental Section
Reagents
and Solutions
Bacterial cultures of E. coli (hexa-acyl (wild type) BN1 and penta-acyl BN2),5 and V. cholerae (E7946 O1 biotype
El-Tor)36 were grown in 1 L of Luria broth
(LB) to an OD600 of 1.0. P. aeruginosa (PA14) was grown in synthetic cystic fibrosis medium (SCFM).59 Lipid A was isolated by the Bligh–Dyer
method as described previously.5,34 Residual sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) from the purification was removed by washing lipid A
with acidified ethanol or by diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose DE52
column purification, as described previously.36,37 Solvents for HPLC–MS and direct infusion were purchased from
Sigma Aldrich, (St. Louis, MO).

Mass Spectrometry and Liquid
Chromatography
All experiments
were performed in the negative mode using a Thermo Fisher Orbitrap
Elite mass spectrometer (Bremen, Germany) modified to perform ultraviolet
photodissociation (UVPD) within the higher collision energy dissociation
(HCD) cell in the negative mode using a recently described setup.49,58 The mass spectrometer was equipped with a Coherent ExiStar XS excimer
laser (Santa Clara, CA) producing 193 nm photons at a net laser energy
of 6 mJ/pulse. The HCD cell was held at 10 mTorr for all experiments.
UVPD was performed using 10 laser pulses per scan with a pulse repetition
rate of 500 Hz. For HCD, the normalized collision energy was set between
40 and 55% using a 0.1 ms activation time. CID experiments were typically
performed with the normalized collision energy set at 35% during a
10 ms activation interval. Solutions of lipid A (1 μM) in 50:50
methanol/chloroform were infused at a flow rate of 3 μL/min.
The ESI voltage was set at 4 kV, and the sheath gas flow rate was
set at 10 arbitrary units. All MS/MS experiments were performed by
isolating precursor ions using a m/z window of 3.

Separation of E. coli and other
lipid A mixtures were undertaken using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 microbore
liquid chromatography system (Sunnyvale, CA) equipped with an XBridge
C8 column from Waters (3 mm × 100 mm, 3.5 μm particles).
Approximately 1 μg of sample was directly injected onto the
column. Mobile phase A consisted of 50:50 methanol/water with 0.05%
ammonium hydroxide and mobile phase B consisted of 40:40:20 isopropyl
alcohol/chloroform/methanol with 0.05% ammonium hydroxide. Separations
were performed using a 25 min linear gradient starting at 15% mobile
phase B to 70% mobile phase B before holding at 70% mobile phase B
for 5 min and re-equilibrating for 5 min at 15% mobile phase B. ESI
survey mass spectra were collected using a m/z range of 700–2000. The five ions of greatest abundance
were chosen for subsequent MS/MS activation using the UVPD conditions
described above. Cleavage site frequencies were calculated using the
following equation: 1  

Results and Discussion
This study reports a comparison of the fragmentation of singly
and doubly deprotonated lipid A molecules by CID, HCD, and UVPD. The
diverse fragmentation pathways are summarized by using fragmentation
maps similar to a manner described previously.33 Briefly, each cleavage site is labeled with a number, and
the fragment ions arising from particular cleavages are shown next
to each cleavage number with their associated m/z values. Fragment ions that are consistent with ones evolving
from multiple cleavage events are listed next to each of the contributing
cleavage sites. For example in Figure 1A (which
is discussed in detail later) a fragment ion of m/z 1488.04 arises from cleavage of a phosphate group
(cleavage site (1) in Figure 2A) and loss of
the 3′ secondary acyl chain (cleavage site (2) in Figure 2A). Depending on the lipid A species analyzed, isobaric
fragment ions may also exist. To streamline the presentation of data,
only representative cleavage sites are included in the fragmentation
maps. The distributions of cleavage sites of ions observed in the
MS/MS spectra were analyzed by summing the abundances of all fragment
ions associated with a specific cleavage site and dividing by the
summed abundance of all fragment ions in a given MS/MS spectrum. This
allowed a quantitative and systematic comparison of the dominant cleavage
sites for each fragmentation method and each charge state. The resulting
cleavage site distributions are presented as histograms.

and the fragment ions arising from each cleavage site is listed. Those

of the 2, 2′, 3, and 3′ carbons and the GlcN I and GlcNII
are labeled in part A.

MS/MS Activation of Wild Type E. coli Lipid
A
Wild type E. coli lipid A is typically
decorated with two phosphorylated groups at the 1 and 4′ positions
and four primary hydroxyl-acyl chains at the 2, 3, 2′ and 3′
positions of the glucosamine rings (the 2, 3, 2′, and 3′
numbered positions are shown in Figure 2A).
Additionally there are two secondary acyl chains on the 2′
and 3′ hydroxyl-acyl chains, which add to the complexity of
the final hexa-acylated lipid A structure. CID, HCD, and UVPD mass
spectra of the doubly deprotonated wild type E. coli lipid A are shown in Figure 1 (and accurate
mass measurements in Table S-1 in the Supporting
Information), and their representative fragmentation maps are
provided in Figure 2. CID of doubly deprotonated
lipid A (Figure 1A) produces one dominant doubly
charged fragment ion of m/z 783.50,
which corresponds to the loss of one of the secondary 3′ acyl
chains (e.g., cleavage site (2) in Figure 2A). Other low abundance fragment ions correspond to C–O cleavage
at the 3′ position of the glucosamine ring and loss of the
phosphate group. HCD yielded a similar fragmentation pattern to the
one observed upon CID (Figure 1B), along with
a prominent fragment of m/z 227.20,
which is the complementary ion formed upon cleavage of site (2) (shown
in Figure 2B). This latter ion was not observed
upon CID due to the low mass cutoff. HCD also results in a few other
C–O cleavages ((5) and (6)) that are informative for mapping
the 3 position acyl chain (Figure 2B). Neither
CID nor HCD of doubly deprotonated lipid A produced a sufficiently
diverse range of fragment ions to allow confident characterization
of the lipid A structure without resorting to more elaborate MSn modes. UVPD as a high-energy MS/MS technique
generated a wider array of fragment ions (Figure 1C), as noted in our earlier studies of singly charged lipids.33−35 These fragment ions arise from C–O, C–N, and C–C
bond cleavages within each of the acyl chains (Figure 2C). These unique bond cleavages afford a richer structural
map of lipid A, including characterization of the acyl chain lengths.
Additionally UVPD resulted in several informative C–O and cross-ring
glycosidic bond cleavages that do not occur upon CID or HCD. These
allowed discernment of the acyl chain character of each of the separate
glucosamine moieties. In particular, the abundant fragment ion of m/z 738.42 (labeled as cross-ring cleavage
site (14) in Figure 2C) confirms the distribution
of acyl chains among the two glucosamine rings (i.e., four on the
GlcN II ring and two on the GlcN I ring). The UVPD fragment ions were
measured with high accuracy in the Orbitrap mass analyzer, thus providing
confirmation that the types of cleavages and resulting fragment ion
structures shown in Figure 2 are consistent
with the measured masses (see Table S-1 in the Supporting Information).

The singly deprotonated wild
type lipid A species was also subjected to CID, HCD, and UVPD (see
spectra in Figure S-1 in the Supporting Information) and the corresponding fragmentation maps are presented in Figure
S-2 in the Supporting Information. CID
and HCD (Figures S-1A,B in the Supporting Information) led to similar fragmentation patterns, which included multiple
phosphate losses and cleavages at the 3′ and 3 C–O bonds.
Additional cleavages at the (10), (13) (15), and (17) sites occurred
that were not observed for the doubly charged ion (Figure 1A,B). Several high abundance products in the low m/z mass range observed upon HCD were attributed
to fragments from the glucosamine rings. UVPD resulted in a spectrum
(Figure S-1C in the Supporting Information) similar to that obtained for the doubly charged lipid A (Figure 1C). UVPD resulted in a wide range of C–C,
C–O, C–N acyl chain, and glycosidic cleavages, all of
which are useful for the structural characterization of the lipid
A species. Unlike CID and HCD, UVPD spectrum did not exhibit a significant
dependence on charge state.

The cleavage distributions that
lead to meaningful fragment ions
for WT E. coli lipid A for each activation method
are summarized in Figure 3. The preferences
for particular fragmentation processes were compared by constructing
histograms of the relative frequencies of each cleavage site weighted
by the abundances of the ions arising from those cleavage sites. The
distributions were calculated using eq 1. On
the basis of the histograms, it is evident that far fewer cleavage
types occur for doubly deprotonated lipid A compared to singly deprotonated
lipid A for CID and HCD. In contrast, UVPD results in a much more
diverse array of fragment ions, with broad distributions of cleavage
sites for both singly and doubly charged ions. For UVPD, the most
dominant cleavage sites included (2), (3), (4), (6), (10), and (11),
which consisted of a mixture of C–O and C–N cleavages.
Elucidating the exact location and lengths of lipid A acyl chains
along with the number of phosphorylation sites is imperative as these
functionalities modulate the TLR4 immune response. For instance it
was shown previously that hexa-acylated E. coli lipid
A species exhibit maximum inflammatory activity, whereas hepta-acylated
lipid A is 100 times less inflammatory, and tetra-acylated lipid A
is antagonistic.5,60 On the basis of comparison with
CID and HCD, UVPD proves more informative in elucidation of lipid
A structures.

type E. coli lipid A (1797.2 Da) using (A) CID, (B)

doubly deprotonated precursor. Blue bars represent fragments from
the singly deprotonated precursor. Relative frequencies for all cleavage
sites were calculated using eq 1. The numbers

MS/MS Activation of V. cholerae Lipid A and P. aeruginosa Lipid
A
The structures of V. cholerae and P. aeruginosa lipid A species
(see Figure 4) were characterized by CID, HCD,
and UVPD. The structure of lipid A from V. cholerae lipid A is similar to that of WT E. coli lipid
A with the exception of acyl chain composition. As in E. coli, the amide linked hydroxyacyl chains at positions 2 and 2′
are 14 carbons in length; however, the ester linked hydroxyacyl chains
at positions 3 and 3′ are 12 carbons (hydroxylaurates). The
secondary acyl chain attached to the 2′ hydroxyacyl chain is
a 14 carbon acyl chain (myristate), two carbons longer than the laurate
attached at this position in E. coli. Additionally,
a 12 carbon hydroxylaurate is attached to the 3′ hydroxyacyl
chain, which is two carbons shorter and contains an additional hydroxyl
functional group (compared to the acyl chain at this position in E. coli.) Annually, V. cholerae is responsible
for over 300 000 reported cases of the severe diarrheal disease
cholera, and the modification of the hydroxyl group on the 3′
secondary hydroxyacyl chain is important for cationic antimicrobial
peptide resistance in this organism.34

Figure 4 Cleavage
site histograms for doubly and singly deprotonated V. cholerae lipid A (Mr = 1757.2
Da) (A, B, and C) and P. aeruginosa lipid A (Mr = 1617.00 Da) (D, E, and F) using CID (A and
D), HCD (B and E), and UVPD (C and F). Black bars represent fragment
ions from the doubly deprotonated precursor. Blue bars represent fragments
from the singly deprotonated precursor. Relative frequencies for all
cleavage sites were calculated using eq 1. The
numbers representing the cleavage sites are shown on the structures.
Red cleavages are only seen using UVPD-MS.

Although the acylation pattern varies depending on the origin
of
the isolate, wild-type P. aeruginosa lipid A is commonly
hexa-acylated (see structure in Figure 4).
It also contains two phosphate groups located at the 1 and 4′
glucosamine positions, with hydroxylauryl (12 carbons) acyl chains
at the 2 and 2′ positions and hydroxycapric (10 carbons) acyl
groups adorning the 3 and 3′ positions. P. aeruginosa secondary acyl chains also differ from E. coli and V. cholerae in position and carbon chain length, which is
evident with the laurate and hydroxylaurate groups on the respective
amide linked 2′ and 2 positions. P. aeruginosa is a potentially deadly and highly antibiotic-resistant gram-negative
bacterium whose persistence in the human host has been associated
with its lipid A acylation pattern.61

The CID, HCD, and UVPD mass spectra of the doubly and singly charged
precursor species for both V. cholerae and P. aeruginosa are shown in Figures S3–S6 in the Supporting Information, and the fragmentation
maps for each of the spectra are illustrated in Figures S7–S10
in the Supporting Information. The cleavage
site histograms for V. cholerae and P. aeruginosa MS/MS spectra are shown in Figure 4.

The histograms reveal several commonalities for all lipid A molecules
independent of fine structural differences. Regardless of charge state,
CID and HCD favor preferential cleavage of the phosphate or one of
the secondary acyl chains (site (2) for V. cholerae or site (18) for P. aeruginosa in Figure 4A, B, D, E). There were less dominant contributions
representative of C–O bond cleavages at the acyl chains linked
on the glucosamine sugars (such as (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6)).
The CID and HCD behavior of P. aeruginosa lipid A
also displayed an increase in fragmentation generated from cleavage
of the first primary acyl chain attached to the 3′ position
(cleavages (3) and (4)). These product ions were not as notable for
lipid A molecules that contained a secondary acyl chain attached to
the 3′ primary hydroxyacyl chain. Although the CID (Figures 3A and 4A,D) and HCD (Figures 3B and 4B,E) fragmentation
trends are self-consistent, the limited number of cleavage sites limits
the ability to fully characterize the lipid A structures.

UVPD
generated the most diverse array of fragment ion types arising
from a greater number of observed cleavage sites for V. cholerae and P. aeruginosa (parts C and F of Figure 4, respectively). UVPD of V. cholerae resulted in a unique C–C cleavage (cleavage site (18)), producing
the diagnostic fragment ion of m/z 1627.99 that allows elucidation of the key hydroxyl group on the
3′ acyl chain. The presence of this modification affects membrane
fluidity and influences antimicrobial peptide resistance.34 The ability to identify important yet subtle
modifications of lipid A is imperative for correlating immune responses
with lipid A structures. UVPD promoted a mixture of C–O cleavages
of both primary and secondary acyl chains and many unique C–N
amide cleavages (Figure 4C,F). The (11) and
(19) C–N cleavages upon UVPD facilitated the identification
of the 2 and 2′ chains, and the (9), (10), (18), (20), and
(21) cleavages helped unravel the nature of the constituent secondary
chains. One interesting feature is the apparent preferential cleavage
of C–N over C–O bonds for amide-linked acyl chains containing
secondary amines for singly deprotonated lipid A. This is evident
by observing the preference for the C–N bond cleavage (11)
over the C–O cleavage site (10) in Figures 3C and Figure 4C,F. A similar trend
occurs for the (18)/(19) cleavages associated with the 2 acyl chain
in Figure 4F.

Analysis of Lipid A Variants
from Engineered E. coli Strains
The results
described above were acquired via direct
infusion and ESI-MS/MS of individual, isolated lipid A compounds.
The excellent performance of UVPD for structural characterization
and the lack of need for more elaborate MSn strategies motivated the adaptation of UVPD for an LC–MS
workflow for analysis of more complex mixtures of lipid A. Chromatographic
separation of lipid A compounds is particularly challenging due to
the hydrophobicity arising from the nonpolar acyl chains which renders
the compounds most soluble in methanol/chloroform solvents. Extensive
optimization led to the use of a reversed phase approach with a C8
microbore column and a mixed organic/aqueous mobile phase, which provided
a balance between adequate separation, solubility, and ESI efficiency.
The best mobile phase combination was a binary gradient consisting
of 50:50 methanol/water with 0.05% NH4OH and a 40:40:20
mixture of isopropyl alcohol/chloroform/methanol with 0.05% NH4OH. This LC method in combination with UVPD-MS was used for
the analysis of a mixture of lipid A species produced in E.
coli upon combinatorial modification of the penta-acylated
BN2 strain of lipid A. The BN2 strain of lipid A was re-engineered
to express specific enzymes that modulate the synthesis of lipid A.
For example, the BN2 pFLP strain incorporated the 4′ phosphatase
LpxF, the 3 acyl chain deacylase PagL, and the 2 acyl chain palmitoyltransferase
PagP.5 Using a combinatorial approach a
vast array of lipid A variants were produced, to promote differential
TLR4 stimulation and cytokine responses, in order to develop new adjuvants
in vaccines. The production of a number of lipid A variants is possible
from the combinatorial gene manipulation process, and this provides
impetus for the development and application of an LC–UVPD-MS
approach to analyze the resultant complex mixtures of lipid A molecules.

The LC–MS trace obtained for the lipid A species originating
from the E. coli BN2 strain is shown in Figure 5 with the schematic depiction of the identified
lipid A structures. Seven lipid A species were identified based on
the UVPD mass spectra, ones that contained four to six acyl chains
of varying lengths. The lipid A products are categorized based on
those enzymes that were responsible for their modification and are
annotated in Figure 5, as listed in the order
of elution: PagL, unmodified BN2, LpxF + PagL, PagP, LpxF, LpxF, LpxF
+ PagL + PagP, and finally LpxF + PagP. This elution order paralleled
the increases in hydrophobicity of each lipid A species based on the
total number and lengths of attached acyl chains and decreases in
polarity based on the number of phosphate groups attached to the glucosamine
groups. Several other lower abundance lipid A species were also identified
with variable acyl chain lengths and other degrees of saturations
compared to the seven major species identified which was apparent
via the mass shifts of 28.03 (i.e., C2H4 unit)
or 2.02 Da (H2) for the molecular species (data not shown).
Satisfactory separation of the lipid A mutants was achieved based
on the extracted ion chromatograms of each lipid A species as shown
in Figure S-11 in the Supporting Information. Adequate chromatographic resolution is obtained even for ones with
subtle structural variations such as PagP and LpxF + PagL + PagP,
which differ by one phosphate group. The companion UVPD mass spectra
allow confident structural assignments, especially given the high
accuracy measurements of the molecular ions and fragment ions (mass
errors less than 5 ppm) (Figure S-12 in the Supporting
Information).

Figure 5 LC–MS trace of a E. coli BN2 lipid
A strain
grown with the enzymes LpxF, PagL, and PagP active. The major lipid
A species identified by UVPD are shown with a schematic depiction
of each structure and a list of enzymes responsible for the specific
modification(s) of each lipid A. The specific PagP enzymatic addition
of the palmitate chain is shown in red font. The structures shown
on the right are assigned based on the accurate molecular masses of
the deprotonated species and the companion UVPD fragmentation patterns.

Each lipid A species was subjected
to CID and UVPD for structural
characterization. Examples of the CID and UVPD mass spectra, the companion
fragmentation maps for all lipid A identified in Figure 5 are shown in the Supporting Information (all inclusive in Figures S-13 and S-14). The accurate mass measurement
information for single deprotonated BN2 lipid A is provided in Table
S-2 in the Supporting Information. The
cleavage site histograms for BN2 lipid A (Figure S-13 in the Supporting Information) are analogous to the
ones presented earlier, with the histogram for CID dominated by phosphate
loss and acyl chain cleavage, while the histogram for UVPD shows a
much greater array of diagnostic ions, including those arising from
C–O, C–C, C–N, and glycoside and cross-ring cleavages
that are not observed upon CID. UVPD provided a richer array of fragment
ions (C–C, C–N, and C–O bond cleavages), which
facilitated differentiation of the lipid A species in the mixture.
In particular, lipid A species modified by the PagP enzyme (the modification
is shown in red font in Figure 5) all display
the loss of 256 Da, indicative of the presence of an additional palmitate
chain attached to the hydroxyacyl chain at position 2. The UVPD spectra
of lipid A modified by the phosphatase LpxF (Figure S-14 in the Supporting Information) do not exhibit any phosphate
neutral losses, which differed from those lipid A species containing
both 1 and 4′ phosphate groups (Figure 5). Those lipid A molecules modified by PagL (Figure 5) were identified by UVPD-specific cross ring cleavages. In
particular the fragment ion of m/z 512 is indicative of a lipid A species with only a single acyl chain
on the GlcN I glucosamine structure. Identification of all structural
mutants of lipid A is critical because different structures modulate
the immune response to varying degrees. This is particularly challenging
for lipid A mixtures containing low-abundance species like the ones
in the BN2 pFLP strain; however LC–UVPD-MS method proved successful
for this task.

Conclusion
Ultraviolet photodissociation
(UVPD) provided the richest array
of fragment ions for elucidation of lipid A structures from E. coli, V. cholerae, and P. aeruginosa. HCD and CID resulted in far fewer cleavage sites, and the spectra
were dominated by phosphate losses, which limited the ability to characterize
lipid A structure by HCD and CID alone. UVPD produced many more unique
fragment ions, arising from C–O, C–C, and C–N,
glycosidic, and inter-ring bond cleavages. UVPD was combined with
a chromatographic method for a high-throughput MS/MS methodology applicable
to complex lipid A mixtures. This LC–MS/MS method was successfully
applied to the characterization of lipid A species produced by a combinatorially
engineered strain of BN2 E. coli.
