Quantitative and accurate detection
of multiple biomarkers would
allow for the rapid diagnosis and treatment of diseases induced by
pathogens. Monoclonal antibodies are standard affinity reagents applied
for biomarkers detection; however, their production is expensive and
labor-intensive. Herein, we report on newly developed nanoyeast single-chain
variable fragments (NYscFv) as an attractive alternative to monoclonal
antibodies, which offers the unique advantage of a cost-effective
production, stability in solution, and target-specificity. By combination
of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) microspectroscopy using
glass-coated, highly purified SERS nanoparticle clusters as labels,
with a microfluidic device comprising multiple channels, a robust
platform for the sensitive duplex detection of pathogen antigens has
been developed. Highly sensitive detection for individual Entamoeba histolytica antigen EHI_115350 (limit of detection
= 1 pg/mL, corresponding to 58.8 fM) and EHI_182030 (10 pg/mL, corresponding
453 fM) with high specificity has been achieved, employing the newly
developed corresponding NYscFv as probe in combination with SERS microspectroscopy
at a single laser excitation wavelength. Our first report on SERS-based
immunoassays using the novel NYscFv affinity reagent demonstrates
the flexibility of NYscFv fragments as viable alternatives to monoclonal
antibodies in a range of bioassay platforms and paves the way for
further applications.

==== Body
Protein biomarkers
are widely
used as targets for disease diagnostics, which allow the identification
of species at a molecular level. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are
the current gold standard affinity reagents used for protein biomarker
(antigen) detection. However, highly specific mAbs are expensive and
time-consuming to isolate and manufacture. Alternative affinity reagents
have been developed in part to address these issues,1,2 but they often have limitations of their own, such as lack of specificity
or stability, that have prevented their further development into diagnostic
practice. For example, single-chain variable fragments (scFv) are
affinity reagents that can be inexpensively and quickly selected from
libraries displayed on yeast, phage, or bacteria.2−5 Yeast-displayed scFv are selected
by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for affinity and stability
when bound via Aga1–Aga2 linkages to yeast cell walls. Unfortunately,
scFv, which have excellent activity on yeast surfaces, often lose
their activity once in solution, an environment for which they were
not selected. To address these limitations, we previously developed
nanoyeast-scFv (NYscFv) affinity reagents, which were enriched by
binding to surface-attached antibodies specific to the scFv’s
epitope tags.6,7 Further, these NYscFv fragments
have been developed as a replacement for monoclonal antibodies in
our previous work7,8 by applying electrochemical methods
for sensitive detection of recombinant Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica), which is a prevalent waterborne
pathogen that infects humans, causing invasive intestinal and extraintestinal
diseases, and is estimated to cause 50 million infections worldwide
and up to 100 000 deaths annually in developing countries.9,10 Conventional molecular tests for E. histolytica antigen detection include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
and fluorescence-based approaches, in which monoclonal antibodies
are the current gold standard affinity reagents used for antigen detection.
However, the demands of rapid diagnosis and treatment of disease induced
by pathogens require a robust platform that could utilize the low-cost,
stable and highly specific NYscFv as the affinity reagent for sensitive
and accurate multiplexed detection of pathogen antigens.

Surface-enhanced
Raman scattering (SERS) is an emerging readout
technique that can selectively and sensitively detect biomolecules,
such as peptides, proteins and nucleic acids with high sensitivity
and chemical specificity, allowing multiplexed detection using only
a single laser excitation wavelength.11−15 Sensitivity and reproducibility of SERS-based assays
are strongly dependent on the quality of the SERS nanoparticle labels
in terms of signal strength and colloidal stability. A SERS nanoparticle
label comprises of a noble metal nanoparticle coated with Raman reporter
molecules for identification based on their characteristic vibrational
Raman spectrum (or barcode representation). Generally, the SERS enhancement
is attributed to the electromagnetic (EM) and chemical effect (CE),
in which the EM contribution plays a dominant role for the overall
enhancement. Typically, the EM enhancement is highest in a so-called
“hot spot”, which may be generated by excitation of
a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in metal nanoparticles
with very close distances. The generated large EM field leads to a
significantly increased sensitivity down to the single-molecule level.16−19 Although aggregated nanoparticles are often used for generating
hot spots for obtaining high Raman signals, SERS signals are generally
hard to reproduce and quantify since it is difficult to control the
aggregation of the nanoparticles including their interparticle distance.
Therefore, controlling the enhancement of Raman reporters on the surface
of the nanostructures with reproducible signal has been of great importance
for ultrasensitive and reproducible detection in bioassays. Although
numerous efforts have been devoted to address this issue, the preparation
of highly purified and sensitive SERS labels is still a challenge.
We recently exploited an efficient approach to purify gold nanoparticles
in the 20–250 nm size range by continuous density gradient
centrifugation.20 Overall, using highly
purified, silica-encapsulated clusters of gold nanoparticles as SERS
labels provides the following advantages: (i) the silica-coating makes
the particles very stable in physiological environments (different
buffers) and offers a versatile surface for bioconjugation,21 (ii) a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of Raman
reporter molecules on the entire surface of the gold nanoparticles
as well as in the hot spots formed in the junction between gold nanoparticles
provides maximum sensitivity, and (iii) purification of the clusters
contributes to a reproducible signal for the detection.

In this
contribution, by employing the newly developed NYscFvs
as alternative affinity reagents and silica-coated, highly purified
SERS clusters as sensitive labels, we attempt to explore a powerful
laboratory diagnostic platform that can sensitively and accurately
provide duplex detection of target E. histolytica pathogen antigens simultaneously, with the help of a microfluidic
device that contained multiple channels to facilitate the detection.
Furthermore, this new SERS readout platform for NYscFvs reagents will
confirm the utility and adaptability of nanoyeast-scFv as an alternative
to monoclonal antibodies in a range of diagnostic platforms. The incorporation
of inexpensive NYscFv reagents with SERS will also demonstrate a powerful
analytical platform that could be potentially useful for high throughput
multiplexed detection of pathogen antigens.22

(HEPES), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich/Fluka. 4-Mercapto-3-nitro
benzoic acid (MNBA) was prepared by breaking the disulfide bond in
DTNB with NaBH4 as reducing agent before usage.

Monodispersed
gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with a diameter of around 55 nm were prepared
via a modified seed-growth method reported by Perrault and Chan.23

Lyophilized yeast-scFv, and E.
histolytica antigens
EHI_115350, EHI_182030, and EHI_044550 (called “350”, “030”, and “Jacob” respectively) in this report were produced by The University
of Washington, USA, and the Seattle Structural Genomics Center for
Infectious Disease (SSGCID).6,21−26Entamoeba histolytica proteins EHI_115350 and EHI_182030
are E. histolytica cyst proteins. They are known
to be present in cysts based on proteomic27 or transcriptomic28 analyses. Therefore,
they are likely to be present in patient stool and thus are potential
good biomarkers for E. histolytica infection. The
purified antigens and selection of yeast scFv are previously described
in Grewal et al.7,8 Biotinylated anti-HA antibody
was purchased from Sapphire Bioscience. SH-PEG-Biotin was purchased
from Fisher Scientific. Streptavidin was procured from Invitrogen.
Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) tablets were purchased from Astral
Scientific.

The polyclonal rabbit anti-350 antisera were generated
against
recombinant antigen by Cocalico Biologicals, Inc., Reamstown, PA,
USA.9,26 Chicken IgY raised against a cocktail of
030 and three additional Entamoeba histolytica antigens
(EHI_006810, EHI_070730, and EHI_101240) was prepared by Aves Laboratories,
Tigard, OR, USA. Nonspecific IgY was subtracted against 4 consecutive
aliquots of 2 billion yeast-cells prior to conjugation to the SERS
nanoparticle clusters.

Preparation of Silica-Encapsulated, SAM-Coated
Gold Nanoparticle
Clusters
Colloidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs, 600 mL) with
a diameter of 55 nm (λmax = 535 nm in water) were
centrifuged and redispersed in 100 mL ethanol. The colloid was then
incubated overnight with 9 mL of Raman reporter solutions (MNBA and
MBA, 10 mM in ethanol) to form a complete self-assembled monolayer
(SAM) on the particle surface. Aggregation of the nanoparticles was
induced by adding few microliters of PBS buffer solution under stirring.
After 30 min, the aggregated colloidal solution was centrifuged three
times and washed in 50 mL of ethanol to remove the excess salts. Silica
encapsulation of the SAM-coated aggregated colloids (AuNPs-MNBA and
AuNPs-MBA) was performed using a previously reported method.20 The thickness of the silica shell was adjusted
by the amount of TEOS. After several hours of incubation, silica-coated
SERS clusters were centrifuged to remove the incubation solution,
and the precipitate was redispersed into ethanol.

Continuous
Density Gradient Centrifugation
Purified
SERS clusters including dimer and trimers were obtained by using continuous
density gradient centrifugation.20 Briefly,
50 mL of water/glycerol mixtures with different compositions (30,
35, 40, 45, and 50 vol % glycerol) were prepared. Two milliliters
from each water/glycerol mixture were stacked on top of each other,
starting with the 30% mixture at the bottom of the tube. After vertical
stacking, the tube was carefully turned horizontally for the formation
of a continuous density gradient within 5 min. Additionally, the tubes
were centrifuged for 5 min. The colloidal mixtures were redispersed
in 100 μL PVP/ethanol solution and stacked on top of the continuous
density gradient. After centrifugation, the particles were extracted
from the tube with a hypodermic needle by injection through the wall
of the plastic tube.

Biofunctionalization of Silica-Coated SERS
Nanoparticle Clusters
Silica-coated SERS nanoparticle clusters
were conjugated with antibodies
after modification of the silica surface by a siliane agent and standard
EDC chemistry.29 Briefly, 1600 μL
of SERS clusters (OD = 2.75) were first hydrolyzed with 268 μL
ammonia (28%) under sonication at room temperature (RT) for 20 min.
Afterward, the SERS clusters were centrifuged once and redispersed
into ethanol. Sixty-eight microliters APTMS (0.5%) and 68 μL
of ammonia were added to the activated SERS clusters and incubated
at RT for 20 min under sonication. Amino-functionalized SERS clusters
were further conjugated with 120 μL of succinic anhydride to
form carboxyl groups on the cluster. SERS clusters were centrifuged
at 7000 rpm for 10 min and then washed in HEPES twice. SERS clusters
were redispersed into HEPES buffer and activated by EDC/s-NHS (5 mg/1.5
mL for EDC and 3.77 mg/1.5 mL for s-NHS). Two micrograms of polyclonal
antibody was added to the SERS clusters and incubated at room temperature
(25 °C) for 30 min and 4 °C overnight. SERS clusters were
then centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and redispersed
in 0.5% BSA-PBS buffer prior to use in the bioassay. The as-prepared
SERS labels are very stable and can be stored for several days before
use.

Fabrication of Multiplexed Microfluidic Platform
The
multiplexed microfluidic device was fabricated using standard photolithography
procedures and sandwiched between custom built holders to introduce
inlets and outlets for the reagents. Briefly, the gold patterns of
widths 25 and 125 μm with spacing 25 μm were fabricated
on a glass wafer using photolithography. The gold patterns were designed
in Layout Editor (L-Edit V15, Tanner Research Inc., CA) and printed
on a chrome mask (5 in. × 5 in.) obtained from Qingyi Precision
Mask-making (Shenzhen) Ltd., China. Pyrex glass wafers (4 in., 1 mm
thick, double-side polished) were obtained from Bonda technology,
Singapore. The glass wafers were first cleaned in acetone and isopropyl
alcohol (IPA) by sonication for 5 min in each case, rinsed with IPA,
and dried with nitrogen gas. These were then coated with a negative
photoresist (AZ nLOF 2070) at 3000 rpm for 30 s to obtain ∼7
μm thick resist layer. The negative photoresist coated wafers
then underwent a soft baking step at 110 °C for 6 min. These
wafers were exposed to UV light (280 mJ/cm2) using the
mask aligner (EVG 620, EV Group GmbH, Austria), and, after a post
exposure bake step at 110 °C for 3 min, they were developed in
AZ 726 developer solution for 3 min, followed by rinsing with deionized
(DI) water (Millipore Pvt. Ltd., Australia) and drying under the flow
of nitrogen gas. In this step, the unexposed negative photoresist
was removed to realize the photoresist pattern. The wafers were then
treated with oxygen plasma (60 W for 45 s) to remove any residual
resist layer. The gold deposition (10 nm of titanium as adhesion layer
followed by 200 nm of gold layer) was carried out using a Temescal
BJD-2000 E-beam evaporator. To obtain the gold patterns, these wafers
were then immersed in ethanol for lift-off process. Finally, the wafers
were diced into individual devices using the ADT-7100 dicing machine.

Each device was covered with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) containing
three 400 μm wide and 25 mm long channels with 1 mm diameter
inlets and outlets. The PDMS molds were made by casting from SU8–2150
(MicroChem, U.S.A) master fabricated on a silicon wafer by following
the standard photolithography process as per manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, the PDMS precursor was mixed with curing agent
(10:1) (Sylgard 184 kit, Dow Corning), and, after degassing, it was
poured on top of the SU-8 master followed by curing at 65 °C
for 4 h. After this, the PDMS was released from the master, and 1
mm-holes were punched into PDMS to open inlets and outlets.

Fabrication
of the Assay
The bioassay platform was
fabricated according to several steps. Briefly, gold coating glass
chips with 3 channels were first cleaned with Piranha solution and
connected with PDMS to separate each channel. Afterward, the device
was fixed into the microfluidic platform. Biotin-PEG-SH at the concentration
of 2–3 mg/mL in ethanol was injected into each channel and
left for the reaction at room temperature overnight. After washing
each channel several times using PBS buffer, 0.5 mg/mL streptavidin
was reacted with biotin-PEG for 1 h. Bioanti-HA antibody was then
employed to react with streptavidin at RT for 1 h, leading to the
immobilization of the anti-HA antibody on the gold surface. The nanoyeast-scFv
reagent diluted 1/10 in PBS was allowed to bind with anti-HA antibody
for 1 h after washing with PBS.

The sensing gold surface was
then incubated with antigen solution at varying concentrations for
another hour. Finally, the sensor interface was incubated with the
corresponding SERS labels to complete the immunoassay platform. Further
work is in progress which aims at enhancing the binding kinetics between
the biomolecules and nanoparticles by applying external forces (e.g.,
electric forces). This should reduce the assay time, which is a necessary
requirement for real life applications.

Instruments
SERS
clusters were characterized by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL-2100) and UV–vis extinction
spectroscopy (PerkinElmer, Lambda 35). Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) (Philips XL30) was applied to characterize and localize single
particles on a silica wafer in single-particle experiments and to
demonstrate the binding of SERS clusters on the gold surface at negative
and positive conditions.

Electrochemical experiments were performed
at room temperature (25 °C) using gold chip as working electrodes,
Ag reference, and platinum as counter using an electrochemical analyzer
CHI 650D (CH Instruments, Austin, TX). Electrochemical impedance spectra
(EIS) were measured in a 10 mM phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4)
containing 2.5 mM [Fe(CN)6]3–/[Fe(CN)6]4– (1:1) and 0.1 M KCl, using an alternating
current voltage of 10 mV, with the frequency range of 1 Hz–100
kHz.

SERS spectra were recorded with a WITec alpha 300 R microspectrometer.
The 632.8 nm line from a HeNe laser was used for excitation of Raman
scattering. SERS images and spectra were obtained at 20 ms integration
time with an EMCCD, mapping an area of 76 μm × 50 μm
(100 pixel ×100 pixel) using a 20× microcopy objective (100×
objective for single-particle SERS measurement). A silicon wafer was
used for calibration of the system by checking the laser power and
focusing conditions based on the Raman intensity of the first-order
photon peak of silicon at ca. 520 cm–1.

Results
and Discussion
Silica-Coated, Highly Purified SERS Nanoparticle
Clusters with
Spectral Multiplexing Capability and Single-Particle Sensitivity
Highly purified, silica-coated SERS nanoparticle clusters were
prepared based on the chemisorption of Raman reporters on gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs) forming a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on the metal surface.
Particle aggregation was induced by salt, followed by coating with
silica (Stöber synthesis) and continuous density gradient separation
as described in the Experimental Section (Supporting Information Figure S1). The formation
of a SAM provides maximum coverage of the AuNPs surface with Raman
reporters in order to generate maximum Raman signals and minimize
coadsorption of other molecules.30,31 In this study,
4-mercapto-3-nitro benzoic acid (MNBA) and 4-mercaptobenzoic acid
(MBA), both small aromatic thiols, were used as the Raman reporters,
exhibiting only few dominant Raman bands for identification.30 The as-prepared SERS nanoparticle clusters were
first characterized by TEM (Figures 1A and 1B). High-purity yields of silica-coated SERS nanoparticle
dimers and trimers (shell thickness around 15 nm) were generated using
MNBA (Figure 1A) and MBA (Figure 1B) as Raman reporters, respectively, and no monomers or large
aggregates were observed.

Figure 1 TEM images of silica-coated, highly purified
SERS nanoparticle
clusters with Raman reporters 1-MNBA (A) and 2-MBA (B). Extinction
spectra (C) and SERS spectra (D) of the nanoparticle clusters including
a binary mixture.

A typical high resolution
TEM image further demonstrates that the
gap between the dimers was around 1–2 nm (Supporting Information Figure S2), which will generate a strong
EM field for SERS enhancement (hot spot).16,17 Optical properties of the SERS labels were investigated by extinction
spectroscopy as depicted in Figure 1C, in which
the first peak located at 535 nm from both SERS labels is attributed
to the characteristic dipolar localized plasmon resonance of 55 nm
AuNPs. Additional plasmon peaks at higher wavelengths (located at
690 and 735 nm for MNBA and MBA, respectively) are also observed,
which correspond to additional plasmon modes arising from plasmonic
coupling between closely spaced AuNPs.

Figure 1D shows the molecular structure
of the Raman reporters applied in this study together with their corresponding
SERS spectra including a simplified barcode representation (both single
“colors” as well as a binary mixture). The characteristic
Raman peak of MNBA at 1340 cm–1 is assigned to the
symmetric nitro stretching vibration,11 while the peaks at ca. 1080 and ∼1580 cm–1 for MNBA and MBA arise from phenyl ring modes.32 The SERS spectrum of the binary mixture (MNBA and MBA)
clearly shows the distinct fingerprints from the corresponding SERS
labels, demonstrating the duplex capability of this approach.

The signal brightness of the as-prepared SERS labels was investigated
by collecting SERS signals from single particles, which provides the
most direct and unambiguous way for establishing structure–activity
correlations.33 SEM images were used to
characterize a single SERS particle on a silicon wafer patterned with
gold-framed squares and numbers, which enabled the fast identification/localization
of exactly the same particle under the optical/Raman microscope (Supporting Information Figure S3). False-color
SERS images from single particles were obtained by choosing a Raman
point-mapping acquisition scheme with EMCCD detection and an integration
time of 30 ms per pixel.34 In the SERS
false-color images, bright dots were observed from the chosen mapping
area (red-square), and the corresponding SERS spectra obtained from
the bright dots indicated the distinct peak of MNBA at 1340 cm–1 (Supporting Information Figure S3A, corresponding to the symmetric nitro stretching vibration
of MNBA,11) and of MBA at 1580 cm–1 (Supporting Information Figure S3B, corresponding
to the phenyl ring modes of MBA32), demonstrating
the single-particle sensitivity of the SERS labels employed in this
work, which is the basis for the high sensitivity of the duplex assay.

Principle of the SERS Bioassay
Figure 2 depicts the principle of the SERS bioassay platform for pathogen
antigen detection coupled with nanoyeast-scFv (NYscFv) as the affinity
reagent on the gold substrate. Briefly, thiolated-PEG-biotin was conjugated
to the gold surface. Multivalent streptavidin was applied to link
a biotinylated antihuman influenza hemagglutinin tag antibody (biotin-HA
antibody), which captures the NYscFv by virtue of an HA antigen tag
cloned into the recombinant scFv construct. The assembly of the different
biomaterial layers was monitored by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS), which is an efficient technique to probe the buildup of the
biomaterial sensing film and monitor the change on the electrode surface
through the electron-transfer resistance (as indicated in Supporting Information Figure S4).7,8 With the binding of different layers, the electron-transfer resistance
(Rct) increased, indicating successful
stepwise binding of biomolecules on the gold surface. The bound NYscFv
was then employed for capturing the target E. histolytica protein EHI_115350, called 350 or EHI_182030, called 030 depending on the type of NYscFv applied.

Once the
target antigen was captured, SERS labels conjugated to antigen-specific
polyclonal antibodies were adsorbed on the surface to produce the
specific barcode for the antigen detection. The bioconjugation of
SERS nanoparticle clusters to antibodies was based on the modification
of the silica surface by the silane reagent and the cross-linker as
illustrated in Figure S5 (Supporting Information). SERS label-1 was conjugated to a 1:10 dilution of unpurified,
monospecific rabbit α-350 sera, whereas SERS label-2 was attached
to unpurified, polyspecific chicken IgY that had been raised against 030 and three other Entamoeba antigens. Depending
on the concentration of the antigen, different amount of SERS labels
are expected to attach to the gold chip surface due to the strong
affinity between the antigen and the antibody, generating different
levels of SERS signal corresponding to different concentrations for
readout.

NYscFv fragment as probe for pathogen antigen detection (not drawn
to scale).

Sensitive Detection of
Individual Pathogen Antigens (350 and 030)
Sensitive pathogen antigen detection
was conducted with our previously developed, spatially resolved microspectroscopic
SERS detection scheme using confocal Raman point mapping.35,36 It should be noted that this scheme significantly improves the statistical
reproducibility and countervails spot-to-spot variation in conventional
SERS assays with single-spot readout. Figure 3A shows typical false-color SERS images using the integrated Raman
intensity of the MNBA marker band between 1330 to 1360 cm–1 in an area of 76 μm × 50 μm (100 pixels ×100
pixels = 10 000 pixels). Upon increasing the concentration
of antigen 350, more and more SERS labels were captured
on the gold chip surface and consequently generated brighter SERS
images. To test the reproducibility of this assay, repeated experiments
were conducted on three different days and performed on five different
gold chips during the same day. The results are summarized in Figure 3, in which individual SERS spectra were obtained,
averaged, and analyzed, demonstrating distinct peaks from the corresponding
SERS labels and brighter intensities with increasing antigen concentration.
The concentration-dependent SERS response in Figure 3C is based on the average SERS spectra intensity of the Raman
reporter’s nitro band at 1340 cm–1 obtained
at antigen concentrations from 0 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL. The lowest detectable
concentration for 350 was determined to be ∼1
pg/mL (58.8 fM) (Figure 3), for which the signal
is three-times higher than the noise (for 0 pg/mL) as well as with
the detection of 350 at 0.1 pg/mL, which was found to
be similar to that of the background (Supporting
Information Figure S6). The linearity (R2 = 0.96) is seen more clearly in Supporting
Information Figure S6, which shows the 0–10 ng/mL range
on a linear concentration scale, along with the linear regression
line.

Figure 3 False-color SERS images for the detection of 350 at
different concentrations (A), corresponding average SERS spectra obtained
from confocal SERS mapping data sets (B), and concentration-dependent
average SERS intensity for detection of 350 (C).

To clearly demonstrate the specific
detection of E. histolytica pathogen antigen by this
NYscFv-SERS platform, negative control
experiments were also performed at different conditions: (i) without
NYscFv fragment, (ii) without antigen, and also with (iii) a noncognate
antigen (Jacob) at a concentration of 1 μg/mL as
indicated in Supporting Information Figure
S7. Only very weak SERS signals were detected in these negative controls.
For comparison, the SERS intensity was much stronger for the target
(350), even at a low concentration of 1 ng/mL. As an
additional SEM images were further used to visualize the gold surface
based on specific binding of NYscFv with the target antigen and the
SERS labels (Supporting Information Figure
S7B and C). Silica-coated SERS nanoparticle clusters were observed
only when the target molecule was employed (Supporting
Information Figure S7C), while a very clean surface was found
in case of the negative control (Supporting Information Figure S7B), further demonstrating the specificity of this assay.

SERS for the detection of the second antigen (030)
was performed at the same optimized condition as for the first one
(350). As shown in Figure S8 A (Supporting
Information), the brightness in the false-color SERS images
increases with the concentration of 030 antigen, again
demonstrating that the SERS labels are specifically captured onto
the gold surface. This is also reflected in the corresponding average
SERS spectra (Supporting Information Figure
S8B). Finally, the lowest detectable concentration for 030 was determined to be 10 pg/mL (453 fM) with high specificity (Supporting Information Figure S8C). Notably,
the lowest detectable concentration for 350 and 030 detection was a 10-fold difference, which is most likely
due to the different binding affinities between the SERS label-conjugated
polyclonal antibodies and their target antigens. In similar ELISA
and flow cytometric assays, the α-350 rabbit sera has demonstrated
lower optimal titers with yeast-scFv when compared to the α-030
chicken antibody (data not shown).

Microfluidic Device for
Duplex Detection of Pathogen Antigens
A microfluidic device
with multiple channels was developed for
the duplex detection of pathogen antigens as illustrated in the photograph
and scheme in Figure 4. Microfluidic channels
were connected with three inlets and three outlets to enable the detection
of multiple targets simultaneously. Each channel contained gold patterns
which can be used for the functionalization of the device using gold–thiol
chemistry. The detailed design and fabrication for this device is
shown in Figure S9 (Supporting Information). In this proof-of-concept study, this newly developed microfluidic
device was employed for the duplex detection of pathogen antigens.

As displayed in Figure 4B, duplex antigen
detection was performed on the three channels simultaneously. Specifically,
NYscFv-350 was immobilized on the gold surface in the
first channel. And NYscFv-030 was bound on the surface
in the second channel. In the third channel, both scFv-030 and 350 (at the ratio of 1:1) were immobilized to capture
both antigens. After immobilization, all the three channels were incubated
with the antigens 350 and 030 (500 pg/mL
and 5 ng/mL, respectively) and the two different SERS labels. It should
be noted that two antigens at different concentrations were employed
because of the different detection sensitivities for 350 and 030 (1 vs 10 pg/mL) as discussed above.

patterns (A) and schematic illustration of the SERS biosensor platform
with NYscFv for duplex antigen detection (B).

Figure 5 shows false-color SERS images
and
the corresponding average SERS spectrum for the duplex antigen detection.
Typically, in the first channel, dominant signals from 350-specific SERS label-1 were obtained, with some cross-reaction 030
by SERS label-2. Moreover, in the second channel, false-color SERS
images and the average SERS spectrum generated by dominant SERS label-2
demonstrated the specific detection for 030, also with
weaker cross-reaction by SERS label-1. Cross-reactive signals were
likely because of the 10-fold excess of noncognate 030 antigen being applied to the channel, with limited cross reactions
observed at lower concentrations of 030 antigen (data
not shown). Weaker cross-reactive signals may be due to the crude
polyclonal antibodies interacting nonspecifically with platform components,
especially with yeast-scFv, as seen in other assays (data not shown).
Furthermore, SERS images and the average SERS spectrum (distinct peaks
at 1340 and 1580 cm–1 with a ratio intensity of
1:1) from the third channel clearly demonstrated the simultaneous
detection of the two pathogen antigens.

and the corresponding average SERS spectra
for the duplex detection of pathogen antigens (350 at
500 pg/mL and 030 at 5 ng/mL) in the 3-channel microfluidic
device.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have demonstrated a robust and sensitive SERS-based
bioassay platform for simultaneous and sensitive detection of two
pathogen antigens utilizing nanoyeast-scFv as a cost-effective, stable
and specific affinity reagent. Silica-coated, highly purified SERS
nanoparticle clusters were employed for readout, enabling the sensitive
duplex detection of antigens. The microfluidic device with multiple
channels enables a rapid and accurate detection of antigens. Finally,
ultrasensitive and specific detection for individual 350 and 030 was achieved with limits of detection of ∼1
(58.8 fM) and 10 pg/mL (453 fM), respectively. The demonstrated duplex
detection of 350 and 030 paves the way for
a powerful analytical platform that could be potentially useful for
high throughput multiplexed detection of biomarkers.
