Cyclic
diadenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) has emerged as an important
dinucleotide that is involved in several processes in bacteria, including
cell wall remodeling (and therefore resistance to antibiotics that
target bacterial cell wall). Small molecules that target c-di-AMP
metabolism enzymes have the potential to be used as antibiotics. Coralyne
is known to form strong complexes with polyadenine containing eight
or more adenine stretches but not with short polyadenine oligonucleotides.
Using a panel of techniques (UV, both steady state fluorescence and
fluorescence lifetime measurements, circular dichroism (CD), NMR,
and Job plots), we demonstrate that c-di-AMP, which contains only
two adenine bases is an exception to this rule and that it can form
complexes with coralyne, even at low micromolar concentrations. Interestingly,
pApA (the linear analog of c-di-AMP that also contains two adenines)
or cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP, another nucleotide second messenger
in bacteria) did not form any complex with coralyne. Unlike polyadenine,
which forms a 2:1 complex with coralyne, c-di-AMP forms a higher order
complex with coralyne (≥6:1). Additionally, whereas polyadenine
reduces the fluorescence of coralyne when bound, c-di-AMP enhances
the fluorescence of coralyne. We use the quenching property of halides
to selectively quench the fluorescence of unbound coralyne but not
that of coralyne bound to c-di-AMP. Using this simple selective quenching
strategy, the assay could be used to monitor the synthesis of c-di-AMP
by DisA or the degradation of c-di-AMP by YybT. Apart from the practical
utility of this assay for c-di-AMP research, this work also demonstrates
that, when administered to cells, intercalators might not only associate
with polynucleotides, such as DNA or RNA, but also could associate
with cyclic dinucleotides to disrupt or modulate signal transduction
processes mediated by these nucleotides.

==== Body
Cyclic dinucleotides
have come
to the forefront of microbial research due to the impressive arrays
of processes in bacteria that they regulate.1,2 For
example, cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP, the first cyclic dinucleotide
to be discovered by Benziman almost three decades ago) has been shown
to regulate motility, sessility and biofilm formation, virulence,
cell cycle progression, heavy metal resistance, phage resistance,
antibiotic resistance, and quorum sensing among others in myriads
of bacteria, including bacteria of clinical and military relevance.3−5 Due to the varied processes in bacteria that c-di-GMP regulates,
there has been an explosion of investigations aimed at unraveling
processes, which are regulated by this nucleotide.6 Recently, another cyclic dinucleotide, cyclic diadenosine
monophosphate (c-di-AMP),7,8 has also stoked the
interests of microbiologists as it has emerged that c-di-AMP is as
important a second messenger in bacteria as c-di-GMP. c-di-AMP, originally
discovered as a signaling molecule that controls DNA integrity in B. subtilis, has now been shown to regulate bacterial cell
size and/or cell wall formation,7,9 and hence, receptors
involved in c-di-AMP signaling could become important antibacterial
targets.10 In S. aureus, L. monocytogens, or B. subtilis, it has been shown that increased intracellular c-di-AMP endowed
these pathogens with the ability to resist β-lactam antibiotics
whereas decreased intracellular c-di-AMP concentrations made the bacteria
susceptible to antibiotics that target bacterial cell wall synthesis.11−15 In some bacteria, c-di-AMP also modulates ion transport across bacterial
membranes and is hypothesized to modulate bacterial physiology as
the concentration of metals in the environment changes.16 Apart from the aforementioned processes, c-di-AMP
is also involved in resistance to acid17 and heat stress18 in some bacteria. In
addition to controlling bacterial physiology, c-di-AMP also affects
eukaryotic host cells and elicits type I interferon response.19−21 Unlike c-di-GMP, for which many of the protein and RNA receptors
have been biochemically and biophysically characterized, the metabolism
proteins and “adaptor/effector” proteins for c-di-AMP
remain largely uncharacterized and the coming years will undoubtedly
witness an explosion of biochemical and structural characterizations
of c-di-AMP-related proteins and RNA. In this regard, tools that would
aid the characterization of c-di-AMP receptors would help delineate
the details of c-di-AMP signaling in bacteria. Herein, we provide
a surprisingly simple fluorescent detection of c-di-AMP, using readily
available coralyne. We then demonstrate that this new assay can be
used to monitor the synthesis c-di-AMP by diadenyl cyclase (DAC) DisA7 as well as the degradation of c-di-AMP by the
phosphodiestearses YybT17 and SVPD (snake
venom phosphodiesterase). In addition to providing a practical detection
of c-di-AMP, this work also suggests that coralyne associates with
cyclic adenine nucleotides in a mode that is markedly different from
the well-characterized complex formation between coralyne and linear
polyadenine oligonucleotides.22 The interactions
between aromatic heterocycles and DNA/RNA have been intensively studied
for several decades due to the link between cancer and these planar
intercalators.23 Many of these heterocyclic
molecules are known to intercalate into Watson–Crick duplexes,
whereas a few have also been reported to intercalate into non-Watson–Crick
duplexes24−26 and higher order structures, such as triplexes27−32 and G-quadruplexes.33−38 In the past few years, efforts to design small molecules that could
stabilize adenine-rich oligonucleotides have intensified due to potential
biotechnological and medical applications of these molecules.39−47 For example, it has been demonstrated that adenine-rich oligonucleotides
can form hydrogels in the presence of metals and that these hydrogels
are responsive to pH changes.48 Polyadenylation
is also known to play a role in the progression of cancer, and it
has been known for more than a decade that tumor cells overexpress
poly rA polymerases,42 suggesting that
perhaps targeting poly rA could be a viable anticancer strategy.49−52 Poly A duplex formation in the presence of a π-system is well-known;
however, formation of higher order structure with poly A in the presence
of heterocyclic intercalators has not been well explored.53,54

Experimental Section
Sample Preparation for Spectrometric Measurements
c-di-AMP
or pApA, water, buffer solution, and metal solution were mixed, heated,
kept at 95 °C for 5 min, and cooled back to room temperature,
and coralyne was added. The samples were then incubated at 4 °C
for 12 h.

Optical Measurements
NMRs were measured on a Bruker
AVANCE II 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with BBI probe at 20 °C.

UV absorbance spectra were obtained on a JASCO V-630 spectrophotometer
with a 1 cm path length cuvette. The concentration of each stock solution
of c-di-AMP and pApA was determined by measuring the absorbance at
259 nm for c-di-AMP and pApA, using 27,000 M–1cm–1 as a molar extinction coefficient for both compounds.

Fluorescence measurements were carried out on a Cary Eclipse fluorescence
spectrophotometer at 10 °C, with λex = 420 nm
(slit 5 nm) and λem = 430–700 nm (slit 5 nm).
The concentration of c-di-AMP or pApA was 40 μM; coralyne was
10 μM, and buffer was 50 mM Tris-H3PO4 (pH 4.5, 7.5, or 9.2) containing 250 mM KBr.

Fluorescence
lifetime was measured using a time-domain system integrated
with a fluorescence lifetime imaging microscope (FLIM) system Alba
V (ISS, Urbana, IL). The system is equipped with a SPC-830 TCSPC module
and pulsed laser system (Becker and Hickl GmbH). Laser BHL-445 nm
and observation through band-pass filter 485/30 nm was used. Data
analysis was performed using Vista Vision software v. 218 from ISS.

Circular dichroism (CD) experiments were performed on a JASCO J-81
spectropolarimeter with 1 cm path length cuvette. The concentration
of c-di-AMP or pApA was 40 μM; coralyne was 10 μM, and
buffer was 50 mM Tris-H3PO4 (pH 7.5) containing
250 mM KBr.

Enzymatic Assay
DisA and YybT were
expressed in BL21(DE3)
and purified by Nickel-affinity chromatography column (GE Healthcare).
DisA was dialyzed into a 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mM NaCl solution,
and YybT was dialyzed into a 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mM NaCl
solution. Phosphodiesterase I from Crotalus adamanteus venom (snake venom phosphodiesterase, SVPD) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
For the c-di-AMP synthesis assay, DisA (10 μM) was added to
100 μM ATP in 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM
MgCl2 at 30 °C.7 For the
c-di-AMP cleavage assay, YybT (10 μM) in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.3, 20 mM KCl, 500 μM MnCl2, and 1 mM DTT17 or SVPD (1 mg/mL) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8,
and 15 mM MgCl2 was used to cleave c-di-AMP (100 μM)
at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by heating up to 95 °C
for 5 min, and the precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation.
KBr and coralyne were added to the sample to give final concentrations
of 250 mM and 10 μM for KBr and coralyne, respectively. The
sample was incubated at 4 °C for 12 h.

Results and Discussion
Isoquinoline alkaloids, such as coralyne (Figure 1), are known to bind to adenine-rich oligonucleotides and
stabilize adenine–adenine duplexes.24,28,29,55−58 In an important paper by Hud and co-workers, it was demonstrated
that oligonucleotides containing long tracts of adenine, such as (dA)16 but not (dA)4, could bind to coralyne and form
fibers.55 Subsequent works by others have
revealed that the fluorescence of coralyne is quenched when bound
to poly dA59 or rA.24 In line with Hud’s observation that short polyadenines
do not bind coralyne,55 when coralyne was
incubated with pApA (the degradation product of c-di-AMP by phosphodiesterases)
or cAMP in a buffer containing KCl, there was no significant change
in both the UV and fluorescence profiles of coralyne (see Figure 2a,b). On the other hand, when c-di-AMP (which contains
the same number of adenine as pApA) was incubated with coralyne in
the presence of KCl, both the UV and fluorescence intensities of coralyne
increased (see Figure 2a,b). It is known that,
when coralyne binds to polyadenine, its fluorescence and UV absorbance
is decreased,40 but here c-di-AMP enhanced
the fluorescence and absorbance of coralyne; this suggests that the
binding mode between c-di-AMP and coralyne might be different from
the proposed duplex intercalation model.40

of various nucleotides. Condition: [coralyne] = 10 μM, [nucleotides]
= 40 μM; buffer: 50 mM Tris-H3PO4 (pH
7.5) containing 250 mM KCl. Temperature = 10 °C. ex. 420 nm,
em. 475 nm.

Although the fluorescence
of coralyne was enhanced by c-di-AMP
(∼3-fold fluorescence increase), in the presence of 250 mM
KCl, the high fluorescence of free coralyne impeded our initial efforts
to use coralyne to detect c-di-AMP concentrations lower than 20 μM
(see Supporting Information, Figure S1).
We therefore sought ways to reduce the fluorescence of the unbound
coralyne. We hypothesized that the fluorescence enhancement of coralyne,
in the presence of c-di-AMP, was the result of coralyne intercalating
between the two adenine bases of c-di-AMP. If this was the case, then
it was expected that the bound coralyne would be protected from fluorescence
quenchers whereas the unbound coralyne could be readily quenched by
anions. Therefore, it would be possible to increase the signal-to-noise
ratio of c-di-AMP detection using an anion-quenching phenomenon.

The quenching of coralyne by KBr in the absence of c-di-AMP is
dominantly static with Ks of 101.2 M–1 (from the intercept of the modified SV plot, 110.19–9.03
M–1 ≈ 101.2 M–1) compared
with the dynamic constant of 9.03 M–1 (lifetime
data, 0.00903 mM–1 = 9.03 M–1);
see Table 1 and Figure 3. For the Stern–Volmer plot, we used lifetime data determined
from a single exponential fit. This is because the long lifetime component
is not well-defined and fitting the data required fixing a value of
30 ns. After complexing with c-di-AMP, the quenching is significantly
reduced, from intensity measurements that include static and dynamic
quenching Ksv = 0.918 M–1 (0.000918 mM–1 = 0.918 M–1)
and from lifetime data by 0.521 M –1 (0.000512 mM–1 = 0.512 M–1); see Table 1 and Figure 4. For construction
of the Stern–Volmer plot, we used average lifetime from two-component
fit. There is a slightly better fit with three-exponential, which
reveals a long lifetime component of about 30 ns which is in agreement
with previous reports on coralyne dimers.60

lifetime
fit was used for KBr and average lifetimes from double-exponential
fit in the presence of c-di-AMP.

at 25 °C. Buffer: 50 mM Tris-H3PO4 (pH
7.5). Squares are intensity, and circles are lifetime data.

The quenching of coralyne by KI
in the absence of c-di-AMP is also
dominantly static with Ks of 35,860 M–1 (intensity data, 35.86 mM–1 = 35,860
M–1) compared with dynamic constant of 912.0 M–1 (lifetime data, 0.912 mM–1 = 912.0
M–1); see Supporting Information, Figure S3. After complexing with c-di-AMP, the quenching by KI
is significantly reduced (see Supporting Information, Figure S3); from intensity measurements that include static and
dynamic quenching, Ksvc = 25.6 M–1 (0.0256 mM–1 = 25.6 M–1) and
from lifetime data, Ksv =6.4 M–1 (0.0064 mM–1 = 6.4 M–1). Overall,
KI is a significantly stronger quencher than KBr for coralyne, and
similar quenching effect can be obtained with ∼100 times lower
concentration compared to KBr. However, KI also partially quenches
coralyne even when c-di-AMP is present, so for our c-di-AMP detection,
we decided to use KBr as the quencher. Lifetime measurements (Supporting Information, Tables S1 and S2) show
very similar components as those observed with KBr quenching.

At higher temperature (60 °C), c-di-AMP did not “protect”
coralyne from fuorescence quenching by bromide and the value of I0/I was ∼1. (see Supporting Information, Figures S4 and S5) This
observation suggests that coralyne forms a supramolecular inclusion
complex with c-di-AMP, but at higher temperatures, the complex is
not stable and hence coralyne would no longer be protected from halide
quenching at high temperatures.

c-di-AMP could be detected with
coralyne at both acidic and basic
pH (see Supporting Information, Figure
S6), although the fold fluorescence increase at basic pH 9.2 (22.4)
was slightly better than at pH 7.5 or 4.5 (13 and 14.5, respectively).
Having established that the inclusion of a bromide quencher and conducting
the c-di-AMP detection assay at pH 9.2 was optimal for sensitive detection,
we proceeded to investigate if c-di-AMP concentrations lower than
40 μM could be detected with our new system. Pleasing lower
concentrations of c-di-AMP (down to 5 μM) could be detected
using our system (see Figure 5a). This simple
fluorescent detection system could therefore be suitable for determining
the enzymatic proficiencies of c-di-AMP synthases or phosphodiesrases, vide infra.

Figure 5 The fluorescence of coralyne is proportional to the concentration
of c-di-AMP. Condition: [Coralyne] = 10 μM, [c-di-AMP] = 0,
5, 10, 20, and 40 μM; buffer: 50 mM Tris-H3PO4 (pH 9.2) containing 250 mM KBr, showing c-di-AMP concentration
dependence on fluorescence enhancement. Temperature = 10 °C.

Circular dichroism (CD) is an excellent tool to study structural
perturbations that result from the association of a chiral molecule
with another molecule. The CD spectrum of c-di-AMP in the absence
of coralyne is different from that in the presence of coralyne (Figure 6). Upon the addition of coralyne to c-di-AMP, both
the negative and positive CD bands of c-di-AMP increase, indicating
that both the helicity and π–π stacking interactions
in c-di-AMP changes upon the addition of coralyne. An increase in
the CD band is indicative of increased π–π stacking
(presumably due to coralyne-adenine π–π stacking).
For pApA however, there is no difference between the presence and
absence of coralyne (see Figure 6 and Supporting Information, Figure S7). This CD data
augments the UV and fluorescence data, which suggested that coralyne
associates with c-di-AMP but not with pApA (refer to Figure 2a,b). Whereas the inability of pApA to form a complex
with coralyne, at the tested micromolar concentrations, was in line
with earlier studies by Hud et al.,55 the
complex formation between the cyclic dinucleotide, c-di-AMP, and coralyne
was unexpected. To gain some insights into the stiochiometry of the
c-di-AMP/coralyne complex, we performed a Job plot analysis (Figure 7). This analysis revealed that c-di-AMP forms a
higher order complex with coralyne (not the expected 2:1 complex that
would have been predicted from the polyadenine-coralyne model).

Figure 6 CD of coralyne-c-di-AMP
or pApA complex. Condition: [coralyne]
= 10 μM, [c-di-AMP] = 40 μM; buffer: 50 mM Tris-H3PO4 (pH 7.5) containing 250 mM KBr. Coralyne plus
c-di-AMP or pApA indicates coralyne incubated with c-di-AMP or pApA,
with incubation conditions listed in the Experimental
Section.

Figure 7 Job plot of coralyne
and c-di-AMP interaction. [Coralyne] + [c-di-AMP]
was fixed at 50 μM. The experiment was done in triplicate and
plotted together on the graphs. Buffer: 50 mM Tris-H3PO4 (pH 7.5) containing 250 mM KBr. Job plots of pH 4.2 and 9.2
are in Supporting Information (see Figure
S6). Temperature = 10 °C. ex. 420 nm, em. 475 nm.

To corroborate the Job plot data, which indicated
that c-di-AMP
forms higher order supramolecular aggregate in the presence of coralyne,
we proceeded to conduct the NMR titration experiment. The addition
of only 0.1 equivalence of coralyne to c-di-AMP, in the presence of
potassium cations (100 mM), resulted in the complete disappearance
of the c-di-AMP 1H NMR peaks around 8.24, 7.98, and 6.01
ppm (see Figure 8). The complete disappearance
of the proton NMR peaks is either indicative of polymer formation
or intermediates in fast exchange. The complete disappearance of the
c-di-AMP peaks in the proton NMR (Figure 8)
when only 0.1 equivalence of coralyne was added cannot be explained
by a 2:1 complex between c-di-AMP and coralyne; a 2:1 complex between
c-di-AMP and coralyne would have expected molecular weight of 1676.34,
which should be visible by NMR. Second, the Job plot revealed a c-di-AMP/coralyne
stiochiometry that is or greater than 6:1. Adenine is known to form
hydrogen bonds with itself or other nucleobases to form various higher
order structures, including quartets,61 pentads,62 hexads,63,64 and heptad.65 Adenine tetrads, which
usually contain four hydrogen bonds per tetrad, are not as stable
as G-tetrads (which contain eight hydrogen bonds per tetrad). Could
coralyne promote A-tetrad formation by c-di-AMP and are these A-tetrads
stacking on top of each other to form polymers? It has been shown
that the formation adenine tetrads could be facilitated if the A-tetrad
could π-stack with a proximal G-quadruplex.66 Analogously, it is plausible that aromatic ligands could
be used to promote the formation of adenine higher order structures.

of coralyne (0.1 equiv.) to c-di-AMP caused complete disappearance
of the c-di-AMP peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum (spectrum
a). Condition: [coralyne] = 0 or 40 μM, [c-di-AMP] = 400 μM
in D2O containing 100 mM KBr. Temperature = 20 °C.

Because c-di-AMP plays an important
role in bacterial cell wall
formation and susceptibility to antibiotics, which target cell wall
formation, it is of interest to identify c-di-AMP synthases and phosphodiesterases
in pathogenic bacteria, with the ultimate goal that the inhibition
of the synthases or phosphodiesterases could potentiate the activities
of antibiotics, such as the β-lactams. We therefore investigated
if coralyne could be used to assay the activities of c-di-AMP metabolism
enzymes. It has been demonstrated that the PDE enzyme, YybT, is a
c-di-AMP phosphodiesterase17 whereas DisA
is a c-di-AMP synthase.7 We incubated YybT
with c-di-AMP (40 μM) and stopped the reaction at 1 and 30 min.
We then used our newly developed c-di-AMP detection assay to investigate
the c-di-AMP cleavage reaction, Figure 8a.
As a control, c-di-AMP (40 μM) was also treated with snake venom
phosphodiesterase and the cleavage reaction analyzed with our coralyne
assay. Pleasingly, our assay revealed that, under the reaction conditions,
YybT (10 μM) cleaved the majority of the c-di-AMP (40 μM)
within 1 min; see Figure 9. Coralyne can also
be used to monitor the synthesis of c-di-AMP from ATP by synthases,
such as DisA; see Figure 9b.

Figure 9 (a) Conversion of ATP
into c-di-AMP by DisA. DisA (10 μM)
was added to ATP (100 μM) in 200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM
NaCl, and 10 mM MgCl2 at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped
at 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min and incubated with conditions
stated in the experimental part. The fluorescence was subsequently
measured. (b) Cleavage of c-di-AMP by YybT and SVPD. YybT (10 μM)
in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 20 mM KCl, 500 μM MnCl2, and 1 mM DTT or SVPD (1 mg/mL) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, and 15
mM MgCl2 were used to cleave c-di-AMP (100 μM) at
37 °C. Reactions were stopped at 1 and 30 min and incubated with
conditions stated in the Experimental Section. Fluorescence measurements were taken after 1 and 30 min.

Conclusion
In our continuing efforts
to investigate the interactions of heterocycles
with bacterial dinucleotide second messengers, we uncovered an unexpected
interaction of coralyne with c-di-AMP but not the linear analog pApA,
which also contains two rA. Although we have been unable to define
the exact nature of the complex between coralyne and c-di-AMP, due
to possible polymer formation, the optical properties of this supramolecular
complex has facilitated the detection of c-di-AMP, which could be
useful for c-di-AMP research. Nucleotide signaling has emerged as
important in bacteria and regulates diverse bacterial phenotypes.
Currently, there are efforts to identify and characterize both synthase
and phosphodiesterases of c-di-AMP, and it is believed that c-di-AMP
metabolism enzymes could become new drugable targets that could potentiate
the effects of cell wall modifying antibiotics. Herein, we demonstrate
an alternative nonradioactive assay to study the enzymatic proficiencies
of c-di-AMP metabolism proteins (DAC and PDE). This simple fluorescent
assay could also be adapted for a high-throughput screen for c-di-AMP
phosphodiesterase inhibitors, which are expected to potentiate the
killing effects of peptidoglycan inhibition drugs. This work also
demonstrates that, although at low micromolar concentrations, small
nucleotides are not known to readily associate with heterocyclic intercalators
(unlike polynucleotides), the circularization of dinucleotides appear
to enhance aggregate formation. Plausibly, the high entropic cost,
associated with bringing many small nucleotides together for complex
formation, is reduced upon circularization because of reduction in
degree of freedom. Circularization of oligonucleotides could be an
under-utilized strategy, which might improve oligonucleotide association
kinetics or stability.
