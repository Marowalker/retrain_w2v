The
use of multivariate analysis techniques, such as principal
component analysis–inverse least-squares (PCA–ILS),
has become standard for signal isolation from in vivo fast-scan cyclic
voltammetric (FSCV) data due to its superior noise removal and interferent-detection
capabilities. However, the requirement of collecting separate training
data for PCA–ILS model construction increases experimental
complexity and, as such, has been the source of recent controversy.
Here, we explore an alternative method, multivariate curve resolution–alternating
least-squares (MCR–ALS), to circumvent this issue while retaining
the advantages of multivariate analysis. As compared to PCA–ILS,
which relies on explicit user definition of component number and profiles,
MCR–ALS relies on the unique temporal signatures of individual
chemical components for analyte-profile determination. However, due
to increased model freedom, proper deployment of MCR–ALS requires
careful consideration of the model parameters and the imposition of
constraints on possible model solutions. As such, approaches to achieve
meaningful MCR–ALS models are characterized. It is shown, through
use of previously reported techniques, that MCR–ALS can produce
similar results to PCA–ILS and may serve as a useful supplement
or replacement to PCA–ILS for signal isolation from FSCV data.

==== Body
Fast-scan
cyclic voltammetry
(FSCV) has several advantages over other electrochemical techniques
for studying in vivo extracellular neurotransmitter dynamics, particularly
the selectivity afforded by analyte voltammetric profiles. Full realization
of this, however, demands multivariate data analysis.1−3 Several methods have been reported, including partial least-squares
and elastic net regression.4,5 Among these, the factor
analysis-based principal component analysis–inverse least-squares
regression (PCA–ILS, elsewhere referred to as principal component
regression, or PCR, but written in full here for consistency in abbreviation),
introduced for FSCV analysis by our lab, has been shown as a reliable
approach for in vitro and in vivo analyte-signal isolation from multicomponent
data.6−8 Further, its development for FSCV analysis has resulted
in implementation of model-validation procedures, giving confidence
in model-generated estimates.9,10 However, a primary
drawback has been the necessity of separate training-set construction
for model generation. Chemometrics and previous research suggest training
sets must be generated under the experimental conditions for proper
model validation and confidence in the concentration estimates.11−14 This requirement adds to experimental complexity, and the degree
to which unrepresentative training data affects model predictions
has been the subject of recent debate.15−17 Thus, a method that
relaxes this requirement should be of interest to the field.

Here, we explore an alternative method, multivariate curve resolution
by alternating least-squares (MCR–ALS), to resolve overlapping
FSCV signals. Like PCA–ILS, the data are modeled as a linear
combination of appropriately scaled component signals. However, whereas
PCA–ILS model construction typically relies on user-isolated,
single-component training data for spectral definition, MCR–ALS
can use raw experimental data itself to define component spectral
and concentration profiles, requiring only definition of the number
of components. For this, the unique temporal signature of components
is used for their identification and isolation. MCR–ALS has
been successfully used in the analysis of data derived from a number
of analytical techniques, including mass spectrometry,18−20 spectroscopic techniques,21−23 and slow-scan voltammetry.24−27 Thus, this opens the possibility of circumventing the need for explicit
training-set construction.

However, due to increased model freedom,
important concerns must
be addressed before MCR–ALS deployment. First, the aforementioned
applications relied on generation of second-order data (e.g., data
separated along two variables). Limited success is seen with poorly
resolved signals.28 Resolution is often
achieved using separation techniques (e.g., liquid chromatography)
or controlled independent-variable manipulation (e.g., concentration).
For FSCV, second-order data (i.e., current as a function of potential
and time) is typically collected. However, temporal-signal separation,
and thus the technique’s potential, must rely on naturally
occurring processes.

Second, MCR–ALS solutions are susceptible
to a number of
ambiguities, resulting in mathematical solutions that may not have
correspondence to meaningful chemical information.29,30 The most relevant of these are intensity and rotational ambiguities.
Intensity ambiguity refers to the fact that MCR–ALS only provides
the shapes, and not absolute scales, of spectral and concentration
profiles. However, in the analysis of FSCV data, PCA–ILS suffers
from similar ambiguities, and this problem can be addressed through
normalization of obtained voltammetric profiles and their subsequent
scaling by previously determined calibration factors. Rotational ambiguity,
referring to the fact that the data can be fit by an infinite number
of combinations of voltammetric and concentration profiles, is a more
serious issue. This requires the imposition of constraints, derived
from prior knowledge of meaningful solution characteristics, on the
MCR–ALS fits. Commonly employed constraints include non-negativity
of spectral- or concentration-profile values, peak unimodality, and
hard-modeling approaches using known equations that govern the experimental
system.29,31 For instance, in the previous study of electrochemical
data, parametric equations for peak-shape definition and closure (i.e.,
constant total species concentrations) constraints, as well as non-negativity
and unimodality constraints, were used.24 Background-subtracted FSCV data, however, is more limited in the
information that can define the subset of meaningful fits. For instance,
due to the relative nature of measurements, negative values can be
found in spectral and concentration profiles. Further, the equations
governing the observed voltammetric behavior are not sufficiently
well-defined to use as strict constraints. Thus, a characterization
of the subset of reported constraints that may be used is needed to
ensure their sufficiency for robust MCR–ALS deployment for
FSCV data analysis.31−36

In this study, the potential of MCR–ALS for the analysis
of FSCV data is explored and compared to the performance of PCA–ILS.
First, the basic implementation of the method is described. Next,
the method is characterized in vitro to determine the conditions that
enable successful signal isolation. This is followed by in vivo comparison
of PCA–ILS and MCR–ALS. It is shown that the method,
given appropriate constraints, is capable of producing similar results
to PCA–ILS without the need for separate training data. Further,
methods to extend the utility of the technique and for model validation
(i.e., residual analysis) are explored.

Experimental Section
Instrumentation
and Software
T-650 type, cylindrical
carbon-fiber microelectrodes (Thornel, Amoco Corporation, Greenville,
SC; pulled in glass capillaries and cut to 75–125 μm
exposed lengths) were used in experimentation. After the microelectrodes
were pulled, the seals of the electrodes were dipped in epoxy (EPON
Resin 828, Miller-Stephenson, Danbury, Connecticut) mixed with 14%
w/w m-phenylenediamine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) at 80 °C, briefly washed with acetone, and heated at 100
°C (5 h) and then 150 °C (at least 12 h).

Data were
acquired with a commercial interface (PCI-6052, 16 bit, National instruments,
Austin, TX) with a personal home computer and analyzed using locally
constructed hardware and software written in LabVIEW (HDCV, National
Instruments, Austin, TX).37 Unless otherwise
noted, triangular excursions of the working electrode potential (−0.4
to 1.3 V vs Ag/AgCl) were made at a scan rate of 400 V/s and repeated
at a frequency of 10 Hz. Measurements were conducted inside a grounded
Faraday cage to minimize electrical noise.

Electrochemical Experiments
Flow-injection analysis
experiments were performed using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus,
Holliston, MA) operated at 0.8 mL/min using PEEK tubing (Sigma-Aldrich)
connected to a pneumatically controlled six-port injection valve (Rheodyne,
Rohnert Park, CA). All solutions were prepared in TRIS (2.0 mM Na2SO4, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4·H2O, 140 mM NaCl, 3.25 KCl, 1.2 mM CaCl2·2H2O, 1.2 mM MgCl2·6H2O, and 15 mM
Trizma HCl) and adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH as necessary.

In Vivo
Measurements
Male Sprague–Dawley rats
from Charles River (Wilmington, MA, USA) were housed individually
on a 12/12 h light/dark cycle. Animal procedures were approved by
the UNC-Chapel Hill Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Surgery was performed on the animals in the manner described previously
for intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) experiments and given a minimum
of 3 days of recovery prior to training.38 Rats were trained in ICSS using a fixed-ratio 1 or fixed-interval
5 schedule.39

Data Analysis
Data and statistical analyses were performed
in GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA), LabView
(National Instruments, Austin, TX), and MATLAB (Mathwork, Natick,
MA). Convergence was defined as achievement of differences in consecutive
residual values of 0.1% or the performance of 200 iterations, whichever
was achieved first.

Theory
Multivariate Curve Resolution–Alternating
Least Squares
The theory of PCA–ILS has been previously
discussed.16 Here, we address the general
theory behind MCR–ALS.
As in PCA–ILS, the “bilinear” model is used.28,32,36 That is, each measurement (i.e.,
individual current measurements and entire voltammograms) is assumed
to be a linear combination of the independent contributions of analytes
and noise 1  where D is the (r × c) data matrix containing c spectra consisting of r individual measurements
(e.g., current measurements in a voltammogram), C and S are (r × l) and (c × l) matrices containing the l pure concentration profiles and spectra, respectively,
and E is the (r × c) error matrix. This equation is visually shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Graphical representation
of the bilinear calibration model (eq 1) with background-subtracted
FSCV data. Above are shown the dopamine (1) and pH (2) concentration
traces. Below are shown the dopamine (3) and pH (4) voltammograms.

First, the model parameters and
inputs, namely, the number of expected
components and the initial estimates of the either the voltammograms
or concentrations, must be defined.32,40 There exist
many ways to achieve the former, and a comparison of the effectiveness
of a large number for LC–NMR data analysis has been reported.41 One class of techniques relies on factor-based
analysis of the experimental data, including evaluation of PCA-generated
singular values (e.g., Malinowski’s F-test) or other PCA-based
methods (e.g., evolving-factor analysis, or EFA, and target-factor
analysis).42−48 Additionally, orthogonalization methods (e.g., orthogonal-projection
approach, or OPA), which select the most dissimilar spectra from the
data, may be used, and have been shown to perform favorably relative
to Malinowski’s F-test in HPLC-DAD data analysis.49,50 Alternatively, this can be set through a priori knowledge or multiple
fits with varying number of components to yield meaningful solutions.31,32,40,51,52 For initial estimates of either the voltammetric
or concentration profiles, many of the same methods apply. Otherwise,
expected concentration or spectral profiles or even the data themselves
may be used as inputs.36,40 Here, Malinowski’s F-test,
which has been used previously for FSCV, and the EFA and OPA techniques
are explored, the latter described briefly below.

With the model
defined, eq 1 is solved
using the alternating least-squares (ALS) approach.
This method iterates between generating concentration or spectral
estimates, given spectral or concentration estimates, respectively.
In its unconstrained form, the following equations are used 2   3  where the superscript
+ indicates the matrix
pseudoinverse. This process continues until a predefined threshold
of convergence, or a set number of iteration cycles, is reached. If
constraints are to be applied, this is done either through direct
alteration of the obtained estimates,40 the use of penalty functions,36 or alternative
means of regression.53,54 Additionally, the experimental-data
matrix is often pretreated by factor analysis (e.g., PCA) itself prior
to fitting, as this reduces the effect of noise.32,34 If this is done, the reconstructed data set using only significant
principal components (D*) is used in lieu of the original
data matrix (D) in eqs 2 and 3. Such an approach is particularly
advantageous for low signal-to-noise data and is used here.

Implementation
of Soft Constraints Using Penalty Functions
As mentioned
before, FSCV data fails to meet the criteria for the
application of many commonly used constraints. However, reference
data may be incorporated to help define the fits through equality
constraints (i.e., spectral or concentration estimates are forced
to equal to values of reference data).55 Further, constraints can be enforced in a “soft” manner,
allowing deviations from the reference values through incorporation
of weighted penalty functions into the model. Here, we use the P–ALS
algorithm introduced by Gemperline and Cash to realize this.36 While illustrated in detail in reference (34), in short, “soft”
equality constraints with a complete set of spectral reference data
are implemented through modification of the system of equations represented
by (1) by addition of the equivalent of the following 4  where Sref is the reference
spectral matrix, H is diagonal matrix
of ones, and w is a scalar weighting factor that
determines the relative importance of this equation during the fitting
procedure. Note that the symbol for the weighting factor here (w) is changed from that (λ) used by Gemperline and
Cash to avoid confusion with its use to represent eigenvalues, used
below and in previous work from our lab.47 The power of this equation lies in its flexibility. Incomplete reference
data (e.g., one spectrum for a multicomponent system) can be used
by appropriately adjusting the H matrix. Further, the
weighting factor w can be used to tune how strictly
this constraint is enforced. Small values of w allow
strong deviations from the reference spectra, while very large values
force strict adherence. Of note, use of the k vectors,
PCA model estimates of spectral shape from training-set analysis,
as reference spectra with this P–ALS method and a high w (approaching infinity) would produce the results obtained
from PCA–ILS.

Methods for Model Initialization
Here, the methods
described above that were explored in this study for model definition
will be briefly covered with the exception of the Malinowski’s
F-test, which has been explored in detail in the context of FSCV elsewhere.47

Orthogonal Projection Approach
The
orthogonal-projection
approach (OPA) relies on the iterative determination of most dissimilar
spectra in the data. For each iteration, every spectrum (si) is compared to a normalized reference spectra set (sref), first defined as only the mean data spectrum
(s̅). The dissimilarity (di) is calculated as the determinant of the square matrix
formed by the product of a matrix Yi, which has sref and si as its rows, and its transpose 5  

On the first iteration, the spectra
(sref,1) with the highest dissimilarity replaces s̅ as the reference spectrum in Yi. Dissimilarities are calculated again; however,
the most dissimilar spectrum with sref,1 is
now added to Yi. This process
continues until a plot of the dissimilarity versus time (Figure 2B) shows no distinct
peak or contains only random noise, or there is redundancy in the
reference shapes.

and evolving-factor analysis (EFA). (A) Color plot with 8 s dopamine

and second (green) runs of OPA. The spectra shown to the right are
those selected by OPA for a given run (i.e., the voltammograms at
the time corresponding to the maximum dissimilarity value). (C) EFA
plot of logarithm of eigenvalues shown for forward and backward analysis.
Note the colors for the first and second eigenvalues are swapped between
the forward and backward direction to aid in the interpretation detailed
in the text (i.e., the same colored lines for the forward and backward
direction indicate the appearance and disappearance of a given analyte).

Evolving-Factor Analysis
For evolving-factor analysis
(EFA), PCA is performed on successively larger portions of the data
window, typically in the forward and backward direction along the
relevant variable (e.g., time). For identification of the number of
components (NC), an EFA plot (logarithm
of the eigenvalues vs time) is constructed (Figure 2C) for the forward and backward analyses.
In the forward direction, an increase (moving from time 1 to T) in the nth eigenvalue suggests the appearance
of the nth analyte (e.g., the rise in the orange
solid line at t ≈ 7 indicates the appearance
of dopamine in Figure 2C). In the backward direction, an increase (moving from time T to 1) in the nth eigenvalue is interpreted
as the disappearance of the (NC – n + 1)th analyte, provided the analytes appear and disappear
in successive order. A rough estimate of the concentration profile
can be obtained by combining the forward and backward analysis, taking
the lower value of the two at any given time.

Results and Discussion
In Vitro
Evaluation of Dopamine-pH (DA-pH) Mixtures with MCR–ALS
First, the utility and limitations of MCR–ALS for FSCV signal
were assessed using data from in vitro flow-injection analysis of
the previously studied system of dopamine and pH changes.15,16 Note that no attempt at determining “true” concentration
values will be made, as signal isolation, not quantitation, is the
focus here.

It was first verified that the technique successfully
isolated the signals from single-component solutions, which could
be done through unconstrained MCR–ALS. Various initialization
methods (current at the dopamine oxidation potential for concentration,
data spectra, and an OPA-generated spectra) and use of PCA pretreatment
were tried, and nearly identical solutions were obtained (data not
shown). Figure 3A shows
an example fit to data from flow-cell analysis of a 1.0 μM dopamine
bolus (initialized with the dopamine oxidation current and untreated
with PCA) compared to an experimental dopamine CV and the current–time
trace. It can be seen that the MCR–ALS estimates are nearly
identical to these references, but have lower noise levels.

a flow-injection analysis of a bolus of dopamine. Clockwise from top

and MCR–ALS estimate (black); current at the dopamine oxidation
potential as a function of time (orange) and MCR–ALS estimate

Next, the potential for MCR–ALS
for separating DA-pH mixtures
was evaluated. As noted before, the success of MCR–ALS is anticipated
to be dependent on the temporal signal separation. Thus, simulated
mixture data were created from independent injections (8 s duration)
of dopamine and pH by adding these data together with differing time
delays between the appearances of analyte signal. The performance
of the methods described in the Theory section
for model definition was evaluated using this data (Table S-1). Malinowski’s F-test has
been used in FSCV analysis in the context of rank selection in PCA–ILS;
however, abnormally high rank estimates were obtained when large portions
of the data matrix were analyzed, similar to the results reported
by Vivo-Truyols et al. in the analysis of HPLC-DAD data.50 Visual inspection of the PCs and PC-reconstructed
data confirmed that these extra components consisted of random noise
(data not shown). This may be due to the large number of voltammograms
that carry no chemical information in the in vitro data or issues
related to well-documented limitations and criticisms of the method
(e.g., the small number of degrees of freedom used in calculation
of the F-statistic and assumption of homoscedastic
and uncorrelated noise).47,50,56−58 Data-matrix truncation, and also confidence-level
increases, decreased the number of predicted components; however,
the results were inconsistent and always greater than two. While not
as readily automated, the OPA and EFA approaches proved reliable indicators
of the number of components, correctly predicting two components regardless
of time separation. With regard to OPA, the most dissimilar spectra
identified in all analyses, except with no separation, matched the
pure DA and pH CVs present in the data. With no separation, only DA-pH
mixture voltammograms were selected. However, the dissimilarity plots
only degraded to random noise after three CVs. EFA analysis correctly
indicated the time of appearance and disappearance for all cases,
except again with no temporal separation. However, in that case, the
technique was able to detect subtle differences in the rate of disappearance
after injection to suggest two components.

These approaches
are also advantageous, as they provide information
about the expected spectra (OPA) and concentration traces (OPA and
EFA, the latter more reliably) that can be used for fit initialization.
Since OPA is computationally inexpensive, this was chosen as the initialization
method. For temporal separation greater than 8 s (complete injection
separation), OPA spectral initialization and unconstrained MCR–ALS
provided excellent agreement with the results expected from the individual
single-component runs. With smaller separations, significant distortions
appeared in the solutions. For example, at separations of 2–7
s, the concentration estimates had sudden artificial changes during
the periods of signal overlap, despite having similar spectral profiles
to those obtained from the single-component runs. At separations of
1.5 s or less, DA-pH mixture voltammograms were primarily obtained
(as shown in Figure 4A for a 1 s separation), likely due to rotational ambiguity. Thus,
constraints that could provide meaningful solutions were explored.

(D). The dashed lines indicate the concentration estimates for the
isolated runs for comparison.

One approach is the use of reference data, obtained separately
from the experimental data being analyzed. It is worth noting that
this library approach has been used with cross-validated elastic net
regression using in vitro data. However, given that this reference
data is not expected to be perfectly descriptive of the experimental
data, we sought to explore the use of library reference data (here,
the average of 10 DA and of 10 pH CVs obtained from separate experiments
using separate T-650 carbon fibers) with “soft” penalty
functions (P–ALS) for imposing loose equality constraints to
guide solutions. First, the effects of the “weighting”
parameter w on obtained solutions for single-component
runs was characterized. MCR–ALS fits to these were obtained
with various w values (w = 0 to
8), and the sum of the squares of the residuals were determined. For
both DA and pH data (Figure S-1A), a smooth
transition can be seen between two different solutions, the unconstrained
(w = 0) and that defined entirely by the average
library CV (large w). As expected, fits with large w values had higher residual values, as the average CV is
unrepresentative of the data. The largest changes occurred around w values of 1 for both data sets, as evidenced by the derivative
plot of the sum of squares of the residual with w (Figure S-1B). The use of a pH library
CV for fitting also lead to considerably higher error, due to the
larger variability seen between pH CVs at carbon-fiber electrodes
as compared to DA CVs.15,47 Thus, the use of DA library reference
CVs is preferred to use of pH CVs. Additionally, the approach should
not be used with large weighting parameters, as these introduce considerable
error into the fits. However, ideally, these constraints can be removed
before the final fit is obtained.

This library P–ALS
approach was used to analyze the DA-pH
mixture data. During the initial fit, soft constraints (wpH, wDA = 1) were imposed
on both analytes using the library CVs as reference data until convergence
was achieved. Then, since the pH library is less reliable, the pH
equality constraint was lifted (wpH =
0, wDA = 1). The solution, using the previous
fit as the initialization, was again allowed to converge. Finally,
the DA equality constrained was lifted (wpH, wDA = 0), and the final solution was
obtained. The process was then repeated to ensure overall convergence.
The approach proved successful in mitigating the issues seen with
unconstrained MCR–ALS, as highlighted for the 1 s separation
data in Figure 4. The
unconstrained solution (Figure 4A) shows distortions in both the concentration and spectral
profiles. After imposition of soft constraints on both analytes (Figure 4B), the spectral
and concentration profiles significantly improve; however, the sum
of squares of the residual values is over 9 times higher for this
constrained fit than the unconstrained fit. Removal of the pH constraint
(Figure 4C) leads to
a better fit at the cost of fidelity of the spectral shapes. Finally,
the removal of both constraints (Figure 4D) leads to improved spectral and concentration
profiles with an identical residual value as that of the original
unconstrained solutions.

Evaluation of In Vivo FSCV Data
MCR–ALS was
then evaluated using in vivo FSCV data obtained during intracranial
self-stimulation (ICSS) sessions (n = 25 rats, 1
session per rat containing multiple, typically greater than 50, electrically
evoked dopamine transients). These data mainly contain contributions
from pH and DA, but are less well-defined and noisier than the in
vitro data. However, within a given experiment, the presence of multiple
electrically evoked transients opens the possibility of using multiple
data sections for model definition. These data were originally analyzed
using PCA–ILS models built from training data collected during
the experiment, which served as a reference point for comparison.

First, the advantages of using multiple transients for model definition
were explored. Separate background-subtracted color plots were obtained
from a given experimental run and concatenated together to form the
data matrix for MCR–ALS analysis. Figure 5A shows an example using three separate transient
windows. Unconstrained MCR–ALS spectral fits were determined
for increasing numbers of snippets, and the PCA–ILS k vectors are shown for comparison. Analysis of only one
snippet provided a moderately accurate estimate of the DA spectrum;
however, the pH spectrum is only weakly determined and both are considerably
noisy (Figure 5B).
Increasing the number of snippets (Figure 5C,D) provided increasingly good estimations
of the underlying component spectra, with improvements in the spectral
shapes and noise.

(right) for analysis of one (B), two (C), and three transients (D).
PCA–ILS k vectors for the two analytes are
shown as dashed lines for comparison.

The most computationally inexpensive application of MCR–ALS
relies on determining a subset of the experimental data for model
definition that is used to analyze the entirety. Voltammetric profiles
are anticipated to remain constant throughout a given experimental
session, and thus, the spectral estimates were determined. Ideally,
the training subset should contain considerable contributions from
all components expected throughout the experimental data. Additionally,
signals should be resolved from one another, which may be evaluated
using analysis of EFA time-course estimates of the analytes present
in a given window. Single-analyte data subsets can be used; however,
care must be taken to ensure that all analytes are represented in
the training subset. Under-representation of a given analyte can lead
to poor estimates of its spectral profile. Further, depending on data
quality, constraints, like the P–ALS equality approach, may
be needed, using either using single-analyte experimental CVs or a
library approach using separately collected data.

To test MCR–ALS
performance, each experimental-data set
was analyzed to select a training submatrix to generate dopamine and
pH spectral-profile estimates, which were subsequently used to analyze
the other experimental data. These results were compared to those
obtained from PCA–ILS using separate training data (Table 1). For each fit, the
correlation coefficient between the MCR–ALS and the PCA–ILS
estimates and the signal power of the difference between the MCR–ALS
and PCA–ILS estimates (their lack of agreement, normalized
to signal power of the PCA–ILS estimates) were determined.
Overall, there was good agreement between PCA–ILS and MCR–ALS.
In general, the estimation of pH profiles differed more between the
two techniques than those for DA, and there was greater variability
in the performance of MCR–ALS for determining the pH profiles.
This was generally due to the difficulty in finding isolated pH spectra
within the ICSS data, given that electrical stimulations were typically
closely spaced, to use for model training. However, no separate training
data was used in this analysis, and the collection and inclusion of
even minimal amounts of reference data collected separately from the
experiment could be expected to improve this performance.

§ For the in vivo
FSCV data
collected during the intracranial self-stimulation trials (n = 25 rats).

Residual
Analysis
One of the advantages of using higher-order
calibration models is the use of residual analysis for interferent
detection and evaluation of model applicability. Thus, we sought to
explore adoption of the residual-analysis procedure introduced by
Jackson and Mudholkar,59 currently used
in FSCV with PCA–ILS analysis, as a first step toward establishing
a means of model validation during the application of a constructed
model to other experimental data. During the training phase, significant
interferences can typically be detected, through methods such as EFA
and OPA or fit distortion.

This residual-analysis procedure
relies on calculation of an experiment-specific Qα value, a threshold for residual-value evaluation
for each voltammetric measurement to determining model suitability
(Qt > Qα leads to model rejection for analysis of that data) that is characteristic
of the noise level.9 This is done using
PCA, identification of the significant components, and error eigenvalue
analysis (i.e., those associated with the nonsignificant principal
components). In PCA–ILS analysis, this step is performed during
spectral-profile definition through training-data analysis. However,
we sought to evaluate whether the use of the experimental data itself
could generate a suitable estimate. For each experimental-data set,
random sets of 5 s windows (n = 6 windows/data set,
50 CVs per window, 25 data sets) were obtained and analyzed with PCA
to estimate Qα using the eigenvalues
of the nonsignificant components identified by Malinowski’s F-test. Table 2 shows a summary of these estimates, as well as those from PCA analysis
of the associated training-set data. Overall, moderate agreement between
the values obtained from analysis of training set and experimental
data was observed. Although there was a large spread of the percent
differences, the Qα values obtained
from the different experimental windows were consistent (average relative
standard deviation of 17.5%). The majority of cases (60%) had lower Qα values obtained from experimental data
than from the training-set data, meaning that for these data, the
former approach generates more conservative Qα values.

latter.

Finally, one advantage
of MCR–ALS as an exploratory technique
should be highlighted. In PCA–ILS, the number of components
is defined using a priori knowledge, and data that fails residual
analysis is thrown out. Further, residual analysis reveals the presence
of interferents but does not necessarily provide robust information
about the interferent spectra. With MCR–ALS, should a set of
data fail residual analysis, a component can be added to the model,
and MCR–ALS can be performed to attempt to gather information
on the nature of the interferent. This advantage is highlighted in Figure 6. Here, a DA-pH mixture
(Figure 6A) is analyzed
with both PCA–ILS (using only a dopamine training set) and
MCR–ALS with two components. The PCA–ILS residual spectrum
(Figure 6B) does have
general features resembling the reference pH k vector;
however, some of the current has been assigned as arising from dopamine,
resulting in a deviation in the residual spectrum from a “pure”
pH signal. Alternatively, the MCR–ALS estimate (Figure 6C) gives a more robust estimate
of the interferent spectra, giving greater confidence in component
identification.

Conclusions
The MCR–ALS approach has several
advantages over PCA–ILS
in the analysis of FSCV data, including more flexibility in model
definition, decreased experimental requirements (i.e., relaxation
of the need to collect separate training data), and more robust handling
of interferents. However, due to this increased freedom in model definition,
considerably more caution must be employed, and the methods explored
here for its deployment (OPA, EFA, and P–ALS) require more
user input than the currently established PCA–ILS protocols.
Regardless, the two techniques generated highly similar spectral and
concentration estimates under the conditions studied here, and MCR–ALS
demonstrates considerable potential as a complementary or alternative
analysis method to PCA–ILS or other reported methods like elastic
net regression. However, further characterization of the technique
for FSCV will greatly help in understanding its potential and limitations.
In particular, the data studied here contained relatively high signal-to-noise
ratios, allowing ready discrimination of analyte and noise contributions.
Preliminary studies suggest that MCR–ALS may be suitable for
analysis of noisier data; however, pretreatment of the data (PCA data
reconstruction), the use of larger number of signal-containing spectra,
and the strength of constraint imposition become important considerations.
