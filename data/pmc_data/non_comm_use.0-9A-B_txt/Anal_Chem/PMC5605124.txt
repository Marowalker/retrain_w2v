Soil fluxomics analysis can provide
pivotal information for understanding
soil biochemical pathways and their regulation, but direct measurement
methods are rare. Here, we describe an approach to measure soil extracellular
metabolite (amino sugar and amino acid) concentrations and fluxes
based on a 15N isotope pool dilution technique via liquid
chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry. We produced
commercially unavailable 15N and 13C labeled
amino sugars and amino acids by hydrolyzing peptidoglycan isolated
from isotopically labeled bacterial biomass and used them as tracers
(15N) and internal standards (13C). High-resolution
(Orbitrap Exactive) MS with a resolution of 50 000 allowed
us to separate different stable isotope labeled analogues across a
large range of metabolites. The utilization of 13C internal
standards greatly improved the accuracy and reliability of absolute
quantification. We successfully applied this method to two types of
soils and quantified the extracellular gross fluxes of 2 amino sugars,
18 amino acids, and 4 amino acid enantiomers. Compared to the influx
and efflux rates of most amino acids, similar ones were found for
glucosamine, indicating that this amino sugar is released through
peptidoglycan and chitin decomposition and serves as an important
nitrogen source for soil microorganisms. d-Alanine and d-glutamic acid derived from peptidoglycan decomposition exhibited
similar turnover rates as their l-enantiomers. This novel
approach offers new strategies to advance our understanding of the
production and transformation pathways of soil organic N metabolites,
including the unknown contributions of peptidoglycan and chitin decomposition
to soil organic N cycling.

==== Body
Metabolomics
is an emerging
field that studies small-molecule metabolites in biological systems
and has opened up a new way to help reveal biochemical links between
microbial community structure and metabolic function in ecosystems.1 Metabolites containing a primary amine group
(e.g., amino sugars and amino acids) are crucial in microbial metabolism
because they are one of the major N sources for soil microorganisms
and simultaneously can be used as a C source under C limiting conditions.2 Amino sugars bound in polymers generally account
for 5–8% of soil total nitrogen (TN), whereas bound amino acids
contribute approximately 30–60% of TN.3,4 Moreover,
amino sugars (glucosamine and muramic acid), d-alanine, d-glutamic acid, and meso-diaminopimelic acid
(mDAP) are biomarkers specific for bacterial and/or fungal cell walls.5−7 These metabolites are almost exclusively present in the form of
high molecular weight (HMW) polymers, i.e., peptidoglycan, chitin,
and protein in soils,8 which can be utilized
by microorganisms only after being depolymerized by extracellular
hydrolytic enzymes to yield small oligomers or monomers.9 Recent research showed that it is this depolymerization
step that is the major bottleneck of terrestrial N cycling.10−12 The free pool of amino acids is very small and contributes to less
than 1% of the total pool,13 but it is
highly dynamic with mean residence times in the range of minutes to
a few hours.9,14 While some advances have been
made regarding concentrations and fluxes of free amino acids in soils,
very little is known about the respective dynamics and pool sizes
of free amino sugars and d-amino acids in soils.14−16 Unlike metabolite concentrations that give only a static snapshot
of the physiological state, quantification of rapid metabolic fluxes
provides critical information on the rates and controls of microbial
processes in soils and on the pathways of production and microbial
utilization. Thus, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive analytical
method to quantify the pool sizes and in situ fluxes of these metabolites
in soil.

Stable isotopes have become an indispensable tool in
metabolomics
and fluxomics research, where they are used as tracers or as internal
standards (IS).17 In soils, flux analyses
based on stable isotope analysis are rarer and have been used mainly
to study the metabolism, respiration, or incorporation of position
or fully labeled organic compounds.18,19 More recently,
stable isotope techniques have been developed to measure gross fluxes
of organic compounds in soils, based on isotope pool dilution theory.9,20 For instance, gross production caused by depolymerization of glucans
and proteins and concomitant microbial consumption of glucose and
amino acids have been investigated in soil by isotope pool dilution
approaches using 13C labeled glucose and a mix of 15N labeled amino acids as tracers.9,21 Additionally,
stable isotope labeled (SIL) analogues have nearly identical chemical
and physical properties as those of the target analytes; SIL compounds
are therefore often used as ISs in relative and absolute quantification
in order to minimize matrix effects and to correct compound losses
during sample preparation.22,23 However, access to
SIL standards is limited for some metabolites due to commercial unavailability
(e.g., muramic acid, mDAP, N-acetylglucosamine) or
prohibitively high costs (e.g., d-alanine). An alternative
strategy to overcome these problems is to obtain SIL metabolites through
biological in vivo synthesis. In a number of studies, fully SIL metabolites
were extracted from microorganisms grown in isotopically labeled substrates
(e.g., 13C glucose), which were used as ISs for a large
number of intracellular metabolites.24

Chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry is extensively employed
for metabolite identification and quantification as it can provide
information on retention time, molecular mass, and compound structure.
Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) has been successfully
applied for quantifying amino acids and amino sugars, but different
off-line derivatization procedures are necessary for distinct compounds
as they are nonvolatile; these procedures are time-consuming and involve
uncertainty in the derivatization reaction.3,9,25 Capillary electrophoresis/mass spectrometry
(CE/MS) provides an approach for underivatized analysis of organic
N compounds, but ionization suppression caused by ion-pairing agents
and migration time fluctuations narrow its application in metabolite
quantification.26 Recently, hydrophilic
interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) has drawn increasing attention
since it offers enhanced retention and separation for hydrophilic
substances such as amino sugars, amino acids, sugars, and nucleotides
compared to that of reversed phase chromatography.27 Although its applications in soil metabolomics remain limited
due to the high amount of coextracted interfering substances from
soils, HILIC demonstrates satisfactory performance in separating hydrophilic
substances from the sample matrix.26,28 Compared to
unit mass resolution MS such as quadrupole MS, the high resolution,
mass accuracy, and sensitivity of Orbitrap-MS instruments have led
to their increasing application in SIL-assisted metabolic studies.29 The high mass resolution (50 000 to 200 000)
of Orbitrap-MS greatly improves its specificity, enables elemental
formula derivation, and makes it feasible to distinguish different
isotopologues (i.e., m/z + 1 of 15N versus 13C labeled metabolite with a Δmass of 0.0063 Da), which is critical in multi-isotope tracing
metabolomics studies.30 The mass accuracy
of Orbitrap-MS is better than 3 ppm, thereby allowing putative metabolite
identification via element composition and isotope patterns in a complex
matrix, even without information on its product ions.31 On the basis of these advantages, HR full-scan MS has been
proven to generate reliable quantitative data in high-throughput metabolomics
studies.30

The main purpose of this
work was to develop a robust, comprehensive,
and high-throughput method to quantitatively measure extracellular
fluxes of amino acid enantiomers and amino sugars in soils, based
on the isotope pool dilution technique, via an ultra-high-performance
liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC/HRMS)
platform. In this study, methods of reaction quenching, extraction
efficiency, and purification/desalting of free soil amino acids and
amino sugars were developed and evaluated. The range of necessary
SIL metabolites was produced through acid hydrolysis of peptidoglycan
purified from bacteria cultivated in uniformly isotopically labeled
growth medium, where 15N labeled ones were used as tracers
for fluxes and 13C labeled ones as ISs. All key amino acid
and amino sugar metabolites in soils and their isotope labeled analogues
were successfully identified and quantified via the developed UPLC/HRMS
platform. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application
of LC/HRMS in soil fluxomics and for absolute quantification of these
free metabolite classes in soil.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
and Materials
15N and 13C (98 atom
%+) celtone base powder, 15N and 13C (98 atom
%+) spectra 9, and 15N (98 atom %) and 13C (97–99
atom %) algal amino acid mixture were purchased
from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Tewksbury, MA). 15N and 13C enriched microbial growth media were prepared
by dissolving 0.5 g of celtone base powder in 500 mL of spectra 9.
All unlabeled metabolite standards and trypsin from the bovine pancreas (lyophilized
powder, 1000–2000 BAEE units/mg solid) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). LC/MS grade solvents and chemicals
were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Bremen, Germany). Soil
samples (0–15 cm depth) were collected from a long-term cultivated
arable field and an adjacent mixed deciduous-conifer forest in Trautenfels
(Styria, Austria) in June 2016. Further details on the sample processing
and soil properties can be found in Supporting Information (Table S1).

Uniformly 15N and 13C Labeled Amine Metabolite
Purification
Peptidoglycan is a polymer of amino sugar strands
(N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic
acid) cross-linked via short peptides (d- and l-alanine, d-glutamic acid, mDAP, l-glycine, and variants thereof).
Thus, commercially unavailable SIL metabolites were obtained by acid
hydrolysis of purified peptidoglycan. Bacillus subtilis (DMDZ 10) was cultivated in uniformly 15N or 13C labeled medium overnight at 37 °C. The peptidoglycan was extracted
using a previously described method with some modification (Table S2).32 Approximately
1 mg of raw peptidoglycan was hydrolyzed in 10 mL of 6 M HCl (12 h,
110 °C). In order to remove HCl, hydrolysates were dried under
a gentle N2 flow and redissolved in water. Finally, the
uniformly 15N or 13C labeled metabolites were
lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. Prior to the metabolic
flux experiment, these 15N and 13C labeled metabolites
were dissolved in water and analyzed by LC/MS for purity and concentration
(Table S3).

Instrumentation
Sample analyses were performed on an
UPLC 3000 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) coupled
to an Orbitrap Exactive MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The Orbitrap
system was calibrated daily for ESI positive mode with Pierce LTQ
ESI positive calibration solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen,
Germany). The MS was operated under full-mass scan mode (m/z 50–600) using ESI positive mode, and automatic
gain control (AGC) target values were set to 1 × 106. The resolution was set to 50 000 to allow separation of 15N and 13C labeled isotopologues. “Lock
mass” correction was set to 105.04232 (sodium adduct of acetonitrile
dimer) and 214.08963 (protonated N-butylbenzenesulfonamide,
a common contaminant from plasticizer). The other parameters of the
MS instrument were as follows: spray voltage, 3.5 kV; capillary temperature,
300 °C; sheath gas, 35 arbitrary units; and aux gas, 15 arbitrary
units.

Amino acids and amino sugars were separated using an
Accucore HILIC column (150 mm × 2.1 mm, 2.6 μm particle
size) with a preparative guard column (10 mm × 2.1 mm, 3 μm
particle size; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Separation was performed
with eluent A (water, 0.1% v/v formic acid) and eluent B (acetonitrile
(ACN), 0.1% v/v formic acid) according to the following gradient:
0 min, 5% A; 2 min, 5% A; 19 min, 40% A; 24 min, 40% A; 27 min, 5%
A; and 45 min, 5% A. Amino acid enantiomers were analyzed by an Astec
chirobiotic T column (150 mm × 2.1 mm, 2.6 μm particle
size) with a preparative guard column (10 mm × 2.1 mm, 3 μm
particle size; Sigma-Aldrich, Vienna, Austria). The separation was
performed by isocratic elution with 80/20/0.1 (v/v) methanol/water/formic
acid. The injection volume for both methods was set to 25 μL.
The column was thermostated at 25 °C, and eluent flow rates were
0.3 mL min–1.

Analytical Performance
of the UPLC/HRMS Platform
Stock
solutions of individual unlabeled metabolites were prepared at 20
mM and mixed to give a combined standard (0.5 mM per analyte). The 15N labeled compound mixture was prepared by dissolving 15N-peptidoglycan hydrolysate and 15N algal amino
acid mixture, resulting in a final concentration of approximately
10 μM of each analyte. The 13C labeled IS was prepared
with the corresponding 13C labeled compounds, resulting
in a final concentration of approximately 20 μM of each analyte.
All stock solutions, 15N tracer mixes, and 13C-IS were prepared in LC/MS-grade water.

The unlabeled metabolite
mixture was subject to a serial dilution; final concentrations of
calibration standards ranging from 1 nM to 25 μM. These standards
were subsequently injected in the LC/MS system to evaluate the retention
time, linear range, and limit of quantification (LOQ) of each metabolite.
LOQ was defined as the lowest concentration with a signal-to-noise
ratio of 10. Mass-to-charge (m/z) accuracy was calculated based on the relative difference of the
observed m/z and theoretical m/z. Quality control (QC) samples were
prepared by spiking a 15N labeled tracer mix to a purified
soil extract. The QC samples were then used to determine relative
standard deviation (RSD) of interday and intraday measurements of
concentration and isotope ratios. All calibration standards and QC
samples were spiked with 50 μL of 13C labeled IS
at a 1:9 ratio (IS/sample) before LC/MS analysis. Isotope calibrations
of the system were performed with different 15N enrichments
(natural abundance, 5, 10, 25, and 50 atom % 15N) at four concentrations (0.2, 2, 10, and 20 μM) for 15 amino
compounds and analyzed by multiple regression analysis (Table S4).

Extracellular N Metabolite Extraction and
Purification
If not specified, extraction of soil amino acids
and amino sugars
was carried out by adding cold (4 °C) 1 M potassium chloride
(KCl) to soil samples and subsequently shaking on an orbital shaker
for 30 min (4 °C, 200 rpm). Thereafter, extracts were filtered
through ash-free cellulose filters and 50 μL of 13C-IS was spiked to 10 mL of filtered extract, followed by freezing
with liquid nitrogen immediately. The frozen soil extracts were then
lyophilized for 48 h and redissolved with 10 mL of methanol. Insoluble
salts were discarded by centrifugation at 12 000g for 5 min. Supernatants were evaporated to dryness under a stream
of N2 and redissolved in 2 mL of 0.01 M HCl. Cation-exchange
solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges were prepared by packing 4
g of Dowex 50WX8 resin (100–200 mesh, H+ form, Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) in 6 mL polypropylene tubes and rinsing sequentially
with 12 mL of water, 1 M HCl, and 0.1 M HCl each and finally with
36 mL of water. After samples were loaded on the resin, the resin
was washed with 10 mL of water, and then analytes were slowly eluted
with 10 mL of 3 M NH4OH over 30 min. Eluates were dried
under a gentle N2 flow, and dried residues were redissolved
in 500 μL of ACN/H2O (80/20, v/v) for further analysis
by LC/MS.

Metabolite Spike Recovery
A spike recovery experiment
was carried out to calculate the recovery rate of the overall sample
preparation and to evaluate the effectiveness of using 13C metabolites as IS to correct for total uncertainty in sample preparation
and LC/MS analysis. Aliquots of 4 g of arable soil were sterilized
in plastic containers by autoclaving at 125 °C for 25 min and
then mixed with 500 μL of 15N labeled tracer solution.
After being incubated for 30 min, all soil samples were extracted
as described before. Samples were then divided into three groups,
which were IS before purification, IS postpurification, and no IS.
In IS before purification samples, 50 μL of 13C IS
was spiked before freeze drying the KCl extracts and then purified
as described above. In IS postpurification, samples were spiked with
50 μL of 13C IS after cation-exchange SPE. In no
IS samples, 50 μL of water was added to the extract before freeze
drying. All samples from the three groups were then analyzed by LC/Orbitrap-MS
to calculate the recovery rates of 15N labeled tracer.

Metabolic Flux Analysis
An isotope pool dilution (IPD)
assay was developed to quantify the gross extracellular fluxes of
amino sugars and amino acids (enantiomers) in soil, in which the target
pool was labeled by adding 15N labeled tracers. By tracking
the pool size and the ratio of tracer (15N labeled metabolite)
and tracee (unlabeled metabolite), gross influx (which is caused mainly
by the depolymerization of HMW organic N) and gross efflux rates (i.e.,
uptake by soil microorganisms) of each metabolite can be calculated.
Added 15N metabolites comprised less than 30% of the original
target metabolite pool size, based on preliminary determination shortly
before each tracer experiment, except for a few compounds such as
muramic acid. Prior to the experiment, soil samples were preincubated
at the same temperature (15 °C) and moisture level (60% of water-holding
capacity) for 24 h. Then, aliquots of 4 g of soil were weighed into
50 mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes in triplicates per soil type
and per time point of sampling. Next, 500 μL of 15N labeled metabolite mix was added to each soil sample and homogenized
by vigorous shaking by hand. The incubation was quenched by adding
20 mL of cold (4 °C) 1 M KCl at 15 min, 40 min, 60 min, 90 min,
2 h, 3 h, 4 h, and 5 h. Extraction, cleanup, and analysis via LC/MS
were then performed as described in the previous section.

Quenching Efficiency
The quenching experiment was designed
to assess the influence of extraction temperature on the inhibition
of depolymerization and microbial uptake during the extraction step.
For this, the arable soil was used since it showed the most rapid
fluxes according to prior tests. Briefly, 500 μL of 15N labeled tracer mix was added to replicate samples of 4 g of arable
soil at 15 °C for 30 min. The extraction and filtration steps
were performed at three different temperatures (25, 15, and 4 °C),
with the extractant being equilibrated to the respective temperatures
beforehand. After extraction, the soil suspensions were left standing
at the respective temperatures for 30, 60, and 90 min before filtration
to investigate whether influx and efflux of amino compounds were inhibited
in the soil suspension. Cleanup and analysis via LC/MS were conducted
as stated above.

Gross Flux Calculations
Rates of
gross influx (GI)
and gross efflux (GE) of each metabolite (μg N g–1 d.w. d–1) were calculated based on IPD theory33 as follows      where C(15N) and C(14N)
are the concentrations of 15N labeled and unlabeled metabolites
(μg N g–1 d.w.), respectively, C(tot) is the sum of them, and at % 15N represents atom % 15N.
At % 15Nb represents the natural abundance
of 15N. t1 and t2 represent the quenching times (min), which were 15 and
60 min for most metabolites except for muramic acid, where quenching
times of 15 and 240 min were used due to slower turnover rates.

Results and Discussion
Purity and Labeling Efficiency of Uniformly 15N and 13C Labeled Amino Compounds
A variety
of SIL metabolites
can be obtained via in vivo biosynthesis, which is often plagued with
problems of low purity and complex matrix. In our approach, a large
fraction of amino compounds were obtained from purified and acid hydrolyzed
peptidoglycan, as it is a polymer of amino sugars and d-
and l-amino acids and is relatively easy to purify. The chemical
composition of peptidoglycan varies significantly among bacteria;
for instance, the bacterial taxonomic biomarker, i.e., mDAP, exists
mainly in most Gram-negative (e.g., Escherichia coli) and some Gram-positive bacteria (e.g., B. subtilis). Considering that the content of peptidoglycan in Gram-positive
bacteria is 5–10 times higher than in Gram-negative bacteria, B. subtilis was selected as the source of peptidoglycan.
Specifically, its peptidoglycan consists of N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylmuramic acid, d-glutamate, mDAP, l-alanine, d-alanine, and l-glycine.34 The purity of the obtained metabolites was consequently
checked since some insoluble cell wall proteins might have remained
as impurities with the raw peptidoglycan after hot SDS extraction
and trypsin digestion. As protein impurities are decomposed to amino
acids atypical to peptidoglycan during acid hydrolysis, the amount
of impurities can be calculated by quantifying the amino acids that
do not derive from peptidoglycan. A low content (<6%) of residual
protein was found in the isolated and hydrolyzed peptidoglycan (Table S2), which indicates the high purity of
our peptidoglycan preparation. However, the protein impurities would
not have impaired the quality of the isotopically labeled tracer because
the tracer used in the flux assays was a mixture of labeled peptidoglycan
hydrolysates and labeled algal amino acids and its concentration was
quantified before the experiments (Table S3).

In order to obtain commercially unavailable SIL metabolites
from fully SIL bacterial cells, media fully labeled (>98 at %)
with 15N or 13C in all nitrogen or carbon sources
were
used for B. subtilis cultivation. The
use of celtone base powder and spectra 9 as the growth medium not
only ensures isotope enrichment in all main carbon or nitrogen sources
(carbohydrates, amino acids) but also isotopically enriches other
less abundant essential nutrients (e.g., vitamins), which minimizes
eventual contamination of 14N and 12C in the
target metabolites. Additionally, these media are relatively cheap
and do not need extra labor or knowledge for preparing culture media.
The level of isotope enrichment of each metabolite in the 15N tracer mix and the 13C labeled IS was calculated as
the contribution of its fully labeled form to labeled and nonlabeled
forms. High (>95%) extents of isotope enrichment were found in
all
metabolites derived from peptidoglycan (Table S2). In summary, by isolating peptidoglycan from fully isotopically
labeled bacterial biomass, we provide a fast and cost-effective approach
via biosynthesis of high-purity commercially unavailable amino sugars
(muramic acid) and amino acids (mDAP) and a cheaper source for those
metabolites that come at high costs (e.g., d-alanine, d-glutamic acid).

UPLC/HRMS Method Validation
The
retention time and
its stability, mass accuracy, LOQ, linear range, and quantitative
reproducibility (RSD) of standard compounds and their SIL analogues
are listed in Table 1. Apart from amino acid enantiomers, all 22 standard compounds were
successfully separated by HILIC in a 45 min run, with the compounds
eluting between 6 and 13 min. Amino acid enantiomers were separated
on a chiral column by isocratic elution over 11 min. For HILIC separations,
it is recommended to use slow gradients and lengthy re-equilibration
times (18 min in this case) to provide robust and reproducible results,
as the equilibration time between changing the eluent composition
and the stationary phase is relatively slow.3515N and 13C labeled metabolites showed nearly
identical retention times compared to those of unlabeled standards
(RSD < 1.7%), and retention time stability was excellent with RSD
< 3%. Most chromatographic peaks had a width of ∼40 s, with
the exceptions of aspartic acid and mDAP, which were slightly tailing
(peak width of 120 s) (Figure S1). It is
noteworthy that the isomers of glucosamine (i.e., mannosamine, galactosamine)
and leucine (i.e., isoleucine) could not be resolved as they have
identical molecular masses and very similar chromatographic behavior
in HILIC. However, in soils, free hexosamines other than glucosamine
represent only a minor fraction or are below LOD.3

High-resolution
accurate mass (HR) full-scan analysis
with Orbitrap-MS has been proven to provide adequate specificity for
quantitative, targeted analysis in complex matrices, comparable to
that of multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) analysis performed by triple
quadrupole MS.36 It also requires much
less labor for method development, which is important for large-scale
metabolic analysis. The Orbitrap Exactive instrument can be maximized
in terms of resolving power and mass accuracy by operating at a resolution
of 100 000 and an AGC target value of 5 × 105, but this will lead to a decline in scan speed and loss of dynamic
range. As we were performing targeted, quantitative analysis of metabolites
across a large range of concentrations in soil, the objective here
was to ensure the absence of peak overlap of target metabolites and
to maximize the linear range. Separation of 13C- and 15N-SIL analogues (isotopologues) with similar masses can be
achieved with a mass resolution of 50 000 and using lock mass
correction. For instance, 13C1-glycine and 15N-glycine with a m/z difference
of 0.0063 can be resolved easily (Figure S2). Therefore, the AGC target was set to its maximum value (3 ×
106) to expand the linear range. Except for alanine (average
mass error of 4.4 ppm) and glycine (6.0 ppm), the mass accuracy of
all other compounds and their SIL analogues was high, with the mass
error being <1.5 ppm with a median of −0.5 ppm (Table 1), which is sufficient
for the identification of target metabolites.

In general, the
analytical performance of alanine and glutamic
acid enantiomers on both Chirobiotic and HILIC columns was very similar.
Calibration curves were constructed by plotting the ratios of the
response of the target compound to the internal standard versus the
theoretical concentrations. Good linearity of MS response (R2 > 0.9955) was observed for all compounds
with
a linear dynamic range of 2 and 4 orders of magnitude, which was similar
to that in previous publications.9,26 The dynamic
range was, however, expected to be larger, but it was restricted here
as the maximum concentrations of standards analyzed were about 10
μM. The lowest dynamic range was found for serine, the compound
with highest LOQ. Most metabolites had LOQs ranging from 1 to 75 nM
with an average of 13 nM, whereas serine obviously showed the highest
LOQ (750 nM). Our method provided similar or better sensitivity for
most amino compounds, as they showed lower LOQ in comparison to that
of other LC/MS2 or GC/MS methods.9,37 QC
samples were used to determine the intraday and interday precision
(RSD), which ranged from 0.1 to 5.1% and 0.7 to 16.7% respectively.
The largest intraday variance (RSD) was found for lysine, glutamine,
and asparagine.

Evaluation of the Sample Preparation Procedure
and Recovery
Rate
Metabolites in soil normally are present at levels of
ng g–1 to μg g–1; therefore,
efficient extraction, preconcentration, and cleanup are crucial steps
in sample preparation. Using 1 M KCl as the extractant provided the
highest extraction yields of amino sugars and amino acids compared
to those using other common extraction media (i.e., water, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.5 M K2SO4, 0.5 M KCl),38 but high concentrations of salts in soil extracts
cause strong ion suppression in the ESI ion source of the Orbitrap-MS.
It has been reported that after 10-fold concentrating, even in soil
water extracts, the MS signal of some organic analytes is completely
lost due to coelution of salts.26 Therefore,
the aim of the purification procedure here was to efficiently remove
inorganic salts from the extracts while maximizing the recovery of
the target metabolites. Methanol is a weak polar solvent exhibiting
much lower salt solubility than water while providing efficient dissolution
of most polar compounds.39,40 SPE clearly offers
better selectivity and recovery of target analytes by manipulating
the pH and ion strength of the eluent, but it has disadvantages in
terms of capacity and complexity of handling. Considering handling
time and extraction efficiency, methanol extraction and cation-exchange
SPE were applied sequentially for removing the majority (methanol
dissolution) and residual of unwanted salts (SPE). The SPE procedure
was optimized by testing the purification performance of different
resins and commercial SPE cartridges. Dowex 50WX8 resin demonstrated
the highest recovery for most amino compounds (Figure S3). The final sample treatment protocol with freeze
drying, methanol dissolution, and cation-exchange chromatography allowed
for a 20-fold enrichment in concentration (from 10 mL to 500 μL)
while decreasing salt loads by >105-fold.

Recoveries
of spiked 15N tracers in IS before purification, IS postpurification,
and no IS samples are shown in Table 1. Compared with recoveries of IS postpurification,
several compounds from no IS showed significantly lower recoveries,
which strongly suggests that ion suppression occurred for those metabolites
in the ESI source. Recovery rates of the overall purification method
can be obtained from the IS postpurification samples, as the 13C-IS corrects only for matrix effects but not for metabolite
losses during purification. The data show large differences in the
recoveries among various compounds, ranging from 18 to 88% (with an
average recovery of 59%), which resulted from their different behavior
during the purification procedure. Large variation in recoveries was
observed for glutamic acid, methionine, asparagine, and phenylalanine.
However, in samples where IS was added before purification, the overall
mean recovery increased to 84% and became much less variable, with
less than 13% standard deviation in most metabolites. The addition
of 13C-IS provided a great improvement by compensating
for matrix effects and losses during sample preparation. In previous
research, due to limited access to SIL analogues, it was rarely possible
to add SIL-IS for all substances. A common approach therefore is to
divide analytes into several groups based on similarities in physical
and chemical properties, and individual IS are then applied for each
group.37 However, our data strongly indicate
that metabolites with similar characteristics (e.g., asparagine and
glutamine) did not perform comparably in terms of recovery rates.
Utilization of insufficient numbers of IS can therefore lead to rising
errors and uncertainty of the data. The addition of the full complement
of 13C labeled IS for the target analytes is strongly recommended
to effectively overcome the matrix effects and to correct for losses
during sample preparation, and concurrently, IS addition greatly enhanced
the robustness, accuracy, and precision of quantitative analysis.

Quenching Efficiency
Fluxomics research requires reproducible
and reliable quenching and extraction methods. A suitable quenching
method for IPD assays should fulfill the following criteria: (i) inhibit
extracellular enzymatic activity and microbial consumption while (ii)
allowing efficient extraction of the extracellular target metabolites.
A previous approach to measure the release and consumption of free
amino acids in litter applied extraction with 10 mM CaSO4 with 3.7% formaldehyde, the latter effectively inhibiting extracellular
enzyme activity and curtailing microbial uptake of amino acids while
causing deamidation of Gln and Asn to Glu and Asp.9 Although CaSO4 allows high extraction yields
of extracellular metabolites in litter, it is unsuitable for soils
due to low extraction efficiency. We therefore sought alternative
quenching protocols using low-temperature extraction with 1 M KCl.
Here, we show the behaviors of glucosamine and proline as examples
to evaluate the influence of extraction temperature on the quenching
efficiency. The concentration of the 15N tracer was used
to investigate whether microbial metabolite consumption was sufficiently
stopped. Figure 1 demonstrates
that even at 25 °C both the 15N-glucosamine and 15N-proline concentrations did not decrease significantly over
time, indicating that the high concentration of KCl and the dilution
effect was sufficient to inhibit the uptake of these metabolites by
microbial organisms. In addition, extraction efficiency was similar
across different temperatures. As the extracellular metabolite pool
influx is mainly due to the depolymerization of HMW organic compounds
by extracellular enzyme activities, influx is reflected in the change
in the concentration of 14N metabolites and decreases in
their 15N/14N ratios. There was a significant
increase in the 14N proline concentration and a parallel
decrease in 15N isotopic composition in the samples quenched
at 25 °C, which provides a clear demonstration of considerable
extracellular enzyme activity (Figure 1). In contrast, the enzymatic activity and pool influx
were negligible at 4 °C for both glucosamine and proline. Therefore,
in the absence of formaldehyde, extraction with 1 M KCl at 4 °C
effectively quenched extracellular enzyme activity and microbial uptake,
minimizing influx and efflux of soil extracellular metabolites during
extraction while providing sufficient extraction recoveries of soil
amino compounds.

Figure 1 Quenching efficiency of the extraction protocol for extracellular
amino sugars and amino acids by 1 M KCl. The kinetics of the concentrations
of 15N labeled and unlabeled glucosamine and proline in
an agricultural soil suspension (1 M KCl) are shown over time, before
being filtered and freeze dried. Extractions and standing times of
30, 60, and 90 min were performed at three temperatures, i.e., 4,
15, and 25 °C. Values are the mean ± 1 SD (n = 3).

Soil Amino Acid and Amino
Sugar Dynamics
The developed
IPD assay was applied to a forest and an arable soil to investigate
the dynamics and transformation rates of extracellular amino compounds.
At constant rates of production and consumption of a soil metabolite,
isotope ratios exponentially decline, which can be shown as a linear
relationship when plotted against the natural logarithm of time (Figure 2). The decrease of
the ratios of 15N tracer/14N tracee in these
plots followed a linear pattern, and good linearity (R2 > 0.95) was observed for most metabolites, indicating
that the transformation rates of these metabolites fit the analytical
solution of the IPD model.

Figure 2 Changes in 15N isotopic composition
(at % 15N) of
amino sugars and amino acids over time. Isotope pool
dilution causes exponential declines in at % 15N of individual pools, which becomes linear when plotted against
ln(time) as shown here. 15N labeled mixes of amino sugars
and amino acids were amended to a forest soil (left) and an arable
soil (right), and assays were stopped at different times by extraction
with 1 M KCl. Values are the mean ± SD (n =
3).

Table S5 summarizes the pool sizes, gross rates of influx and efflux, and
mean residence times of free amino acids and amino sugars in the two
soils. The composition of the amino compound pool showed significant
differences between individual compounds and across soils. The three
dominant metabolites accounted for more than 50% of the total amino
compound pool, which were glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and arginine
in the forest soil and glutamic acid, lysine, and aspartic acid in
the arable soil. Moreover, we here report the first measurements of
concentrations of free muramic acid and mDAP and among the first measurements
of d/l isomers of free alanine and glutamate in
soil extracts.16 Glucosamine and mDAP showed
similar concentrations compared to those of most amino acids, ranging
from 0.6 to 0.8 μg N g–1 and from 0.07 to
0.11 μg N g–1, respectively, whereas muramic
acid exhibited very low concentrations (<0.01 μg N g–1). Moreover, the d/l ratios of free alanine and
glutamic acid in soil varied from 0.04 to 0.5, which is similar to
the finding of Kunnas for soil hydrolysates.41 Mean residence times (MRTs) were calculated by dividing the concentration
of free metabolites by their mean influx and efflux rates, with the
MRTs differing markedly between compounds and soil types. The lowest
MRT was found for mDAP (<0.6 h), and the highest was found for
muramic acid, with a MRT of 18.7 h. Other amino acids as well as glucosamine
showed similar MRTs, ranging from 0.4 to 3.5 h (1.4 ± 0.8 h,
average ± 1 SD of 17 amino acids), which were shorter than those
measured from respiratory use of 14C labeled amino acids
added to soils.42

The influx of individual
metabolites showed very large variation,
ranging from 1 × 10–5 to 4.8 μg N g–1 d.w. d–1. In addition to the high
influx rates of individual amino acids (Asp, Glu, Arg), most of the
amino acids exhibited rates of approximately 0.05–1 μg
N g–1 d.w. d–1. Pool sizes and
flux rates were strongly positively correlated across the different
metabolites. In a log–log plot, influx rates increased with
concentration (P < 0.001, R2 = 0.78) as did efflux rates (P < 0.001, R2 = 0.70), and influx and efflux rates were
also strongly related (P < 0.001, R2 = 0.88). Transformation rates were on average similar
for d-amino acids, as compared to l-amino acids,
a finding consistent with comparable uptake and respiratory use of d- compared to l-enantiomers of free amino acids in
soils.43,44 Glucosamine accounted for approximately
4–7% of the total influx into the free amino compound pool,
indicating that peptidoglycan and chitin decomposition represent an
important input to the labile soil N pool besides protein decomposition.
Accounting for the additional influx of muramic acid, mDAP, and the d-amino acid isomers, the contribution increased to 9–14%.
Surprisingly, although muramic acid has a chemical structure similar
to glucosamine (muramic acid being a lactic acid ether of glucosamine),
it exhibited extremely low influx and efflux rates, indicating that
free muramic acid is not a major metabolite produced during peptidoglycan
decomposition in soils and therefore is also not an important organic
N source for soil microbes. Therefore, muropeptides or N-acetylmuramic acid could possibly represent the major muramic acid-containing
decomposition
products of peptidoglycan.

It is worth noting that the proportion
of influx of amino sugars
and d-amino acids differed between forest and arable soils,
which can be used to estimate the proportion of bacterial versus fungal
cell wall decomposition. This is because free glucosamine in soils
originates from the cell walls of both fungi and bacteria (i.e., chitin
and peptidoglycan), whereas muramic acid, d-alanine, and d-glutamic acid originate from bacteria only. In addition, mDAP
exists only in the peptidoglycan of (most) Gram-negative bacteria.
We observed a higher influx of mDAP and d-glutamic acid in
forest soil but a lower influx in glucosamine, muramic acid, and d-alanine. These findings indicate that in the forest soil there
was a higher contribution of decomposition of Gram-negative bacteria
and of fungal necromass compared to that in arable soil. The method
therefore holds great potential for flux partitioning in terms of
bacterial and fungal contributions to amino compound fluxes in soils.

Conclusions
In
summary, we developed a comprehensive IPD assay to quantify
the in situ flux of free extracellular amino sugars and amino acids
in soil. For the first time, HRMS was applied in soil fluxomics, which
allowed us to measure the 15N tracer level and simultaneously
the 13C-IS in a complex sample matrix. Uniformly 13C labeled IS proved to be sufficient for correction of matrix effects
and losses during the purification procedure. Importantly, our approach
shows great potential to be applied for other target metabolites,
such as nucleotides, organic acids, and sugars, using high-performance
anion-exchange chromatography with anion suppression.45
