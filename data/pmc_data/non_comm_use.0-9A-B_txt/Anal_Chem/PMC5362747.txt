Mass
spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics workflows can crudely be
classified into two distinct regimes, targeting either relatively
small peptides (i.e., 0.7 kDa < Mw <
3.0 kDa) or small to medium sized intact proteins (i.e., 10 kDa < Mw < 30 kDa), respectively, termed bottom-up
and top-down proteomics. Recently, a niche has started to be explored
covering the analysis of middle-range peptides (i.e., 3.0 kDa < Mw < 10 kDa), aptly termed middle-down proteomics.
Although middle-down proteomics can follow, in principle, a modular
workflow similar to that of bottom-up proteomics, we hypothesized
that each of these modules would benefit from targeted optimization
to improve its overall performance in the analysis of middle-range
sized peptides. Hence, to generate middle-range sized peptides from
cellular lysates, we explored the use of the proteases Asp-N and Glu-C
and a nonenzymatic acid induced cleavage. To increase the depth of
the proteome, a strong cation exchange (SCX) separation, carefully
tuned to improve the separation of longer peptides, combined with
reversed phase-liquid chromatography (RP-LC) using columns packed
with material possessing a larger pore size, was used. Finally, after
evaluating the combination of potentially beneficial MS settings,
we also assessed the peptide fragmentation techniques, including higher-energy
collision dissociation (HCD), electron-transfer dissociation (ETD),
and electron-transfer combined with higher-energy collision dissociation
(EThcD), for characterization of middle-range sized peptides. These
combined
improvements clearly improve the detection and sequence coverage of
middle-range peptides and should guide researchers to explore further
how middle-down proteomics may lead to an improved proteome coverage,
beneficial for, among other things, the enhanced analysis of (co-occurring)
post-translational modifications.

==== Body
At the present
time, two quite
distinct approaches coexist in mass spectrometry-based proteomics
studies: bottom-up, peptide centric approaches and top-down, protein
centric approaches. In bottom-up proteomics, proteins are initially
enzymatically digested, after which the resulting peptides are typically
separated by liquid chromatography (LC) and analyzed by tandem mass
spectrometry (MS/MS).1 In proteomics, trypsin
represents the “golden standard” for proteases as it
generates peptides that are relatively facile to separate by LC and
analyze by MS. Therefore, the bottom-up approach is robust and enables
high-throughput analysis, allowing the identification and quantification
of thousands of proteins from complex lysates. However, sample complexity
still imposes a heavy burden on separations prior to MS detection
and, especially when using trypsin, a large part of the generated
peptides is too small for successful binding to the stationary phases
typically used in proteomics. Moreover, peptides smaller than 5 amino
acids are typically not analyzed by MS/MS since they provide too little
of an analytical value for unambiguous identification. Therefore,
quite a portion of tryptic peptides may not be detected or are intentionally
ignored.

In top-down proteomics, intact proteins are analyzed,2 which circumvent issues related to peptide-centric
proteomics such as the protein inference problem.3 Top-down proteomics provides complete molecular specificity
on intact proteins, enabling the analysis of proteoforms4 as intact proteins harbor the entire set of (co-occurring)
PTMs.5,6 The main limitations in top-down proteomics
are related to the difficulty of efficiently separating proteins and
the relatively inefficient formation of fragment ions from larger
proteins. Nevertheless, top-down is now becoming feasible, also in
a relatively high-throughput manner, albeit mainly limited to proteins
with a Mw up to ∼30 kDa. Sequence
information on these proteins can be obtained by employing collision-induced
dissociation (CID) which selectively fragments the most labile bonds
in a protein, which typically provides only limited protein coverage.7 Use of electron capture/transfer dissociation
(ECD/ETD)8,9 was shown to improve the sequence coverage.
Additionally, ETD preserves most common labile PTMs during fragmentation,
facilitating confident PTM site localization. More recent fragmentation
methods, such as electron-transfer combined with higher-energy collision
dissociation (EThcD) and UV photodissociation, are emerging as efficient
fragmentation alternatives for top-down proteomics.10−12

As top-down
proteomics typically covers relatively small proteins
(10 < Mw < 30 kDa) and trypsin based
bottom-up proteomics focuses generally on peptides (0.7 < Mw < 3 kDa), evidently, a gray zone exists
between these proteomics approaches. This gap has been filled by a
third approach, nowadays, called middle-down proteomics.13−15 This approach also uses protein digestion but aims to yield relatively
larger peptides (ideally (far) above 3 kDa).16−19 Middle-down proteomics exhibits
particular advantages as the complexity of the digests decreases (as
fewer peptides are formed) and may also allow better proteome coverage,
including the identification of splice-variants and other isoforms.
Longer peptides also increase the probability of detecting multiple
co-occurring neighboring PTMs, important to study functionally relevant
PTM crosstalk. Most of the pioneering middle-down proteomics studies
have been limited to specific applications, for instance, on recombinant
monoclonal antibodies,20,21 ubiquitin chains,22 and N-terminal histone chains.23−25 Thus, middle-down proteomics is not yet routinely used for the analysis
of full proteomes. We argue that an important bottleneck has been
that neither the pipeline developed for bottom-up nor that for top-down
analyses is directly applicable and optimal for middle-down proteomics.
Therefore, here, we aimed to describe and critically evaluate a workflow
optimized for the detection of middle-range sized peptides.

The first experimental barrier in the high-throughput middle-down
proteomics workflow is the lack of a proteolytic enzyme that can produce
controlled populations of middle-range sized peptides (3–10
kDa). A protease cutting at a well-defined peptide length or size
would obviously be ideal; however, such an idealase remains to be discovered.26 Some known
single-residue specific proteases such as Lys-C,13,27,28 Glu-C,29−31 Asp-N,32 and Lys-N33,34 are thought to produce, when
compared to trypsin, a higher proportion of middle-range sized peptides
and may thus provide second-best alternatives for middle-down proteomics.
Also, some nonenzymatic approaches may be exploited to generate longer
peptides. Microwave-accelerated acid hydrolysis, which produces Asp-selective
chemical cleavage, had been explored by using a number of acid modifiers.35,36 We evaluated whether the proteases Asp-N and Glu-C or a nonenzymatic
acid induced digestion protocol provide middle-range sized peptides.
Second, additional analytical issues remain to be optimized for middle-down
proteomics, such as the chromatography applied to separate the longer
peptides. For this reason, we optimized conditions for sample cleanup
and separation of these longer peptides by multidimensional LC. Finally,
MS transmission and detection as well as MS/MS fragmentation conditions
should be adjusted.37 We fine-tuned the
critical MS parameters for improving the detection of middle-range
sized peptides. Moreover, we evaluated the performances of ETD, higher-energy
collision dissociation (HCD), and EThcD as fragmentation schemes on
all the peptide digests obtained to define the best sequencing method
for distinct populations of middle-range sized peptides.

Experimental
Section
Sample Preparation
HeLa digests were prepared as described
previously.38 For preparing the Asp-N and
Glu-C digests, the protocols reported by Giansanti et al. were used.39 For the acid induced nonenzymatic digestion,
the lysate was diluted to a final concentration of 0.1 μg/μL
using a solution of formic acid (FA) (final concentration of 2% FA)
and incubated at 100 °C for 1 h. A detailed description of the
used protocols can be found in the Supporting Information.

Sample Cleanup and Prefractionation
Following digestion,
sample cleanup was performed by using solid-phase extraction (SPE)
columns: C18 with a 300 Å pore size. Prior to the MS analysis,
samples were fractionated using strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography.
A detailed description of the used methods can be found in the Supporting Information.

LC-MS and LC-MS/MS Set
Up
Nano-UHPLC-MS/MS was performed
on an Agilent 1290 Infinity System connected to an Orbitrap Fusion.
Fused-silica capillary analytical and trap columns were prepared as
previously described.40 The UHPLC was equipped
with a double frit trapping column and a single frit analytical column.
ReprosilPur C18 (3 μm particles, 120 Å pore size 2 cm ×
100 μm) was used as a trap column, and Zorbax SB-C18 (1.8 μm
particles 80 Å 40 cm × 50 μm) was used for the analytical
column. For the 300 Å pore size set up, the used materials were
as follows: Zorbax SB-C18 (3.5 μm particles, 300 Å pore
size, 2 cm × 100 μm) for the trap column and Zorbax SB-C18
(1.8 μm particles, 300 Å 40 cm × 50 μm) for
the analytical column. The column, in both cases, was directly connected
to an in-house pulled and gold-coated fused silica needle (with a
5 μm o.d. tip), and a voltage of 2.0 kV was applied. The survey
scan range was from 350 to 1500 m/z at a resolution of 60 000 (200 m/z) with an AGC target of 4 ×105. The most
intense precursor ions were selected for subsequent fragmentation
at Top Speed within a 3 s duty cycle. A resolution of 30 000
(200 m/z) and a maximum injection
time of 125 ms were found to be ideal for MS/MS. The AGC target for
the MS/MS was set to 1×105. When HCD was used, 35%
collision energy (CE) was applied; in the case of EThcD, 40% supplemental
activation (SA) was selected and when ETD was used 10% SA was applied.
Additionally, charge triggered MS/MS, instead of intensity triggered,
was tested for the EThcD charge method.

Data Analysis
The RAW files were processed by using
Proteome Discoverer, and the spectra were searched against the UniProt
human database. Database searching was performed with Sequest HT and
Mascot, and the results were filtered using Percolator41,42 to a peptide and protein FDR < 1%. A detailed description of
the data analysis can be found in the Supporting Information.

Results and Discussion
Evaluation of Enzymatic
Digestion Approaches for the Generation
of Middle-Range Sized Peptides
This study was aimed at providing
an objective and comprehensive evaluation of the optimization steps
required for the generation and analysis by LC-MS/MS of middle-range
sized peptides (Figure S-1). We first set
out to generate peptide digests of cell lysates, which in principle
could yield higher numbers of middle-range sized peptides. Proteases
that target single residues, such as Asp-N, Glu-C, and Lys-C, are
thought to produce peptides with distinct peptide length distributions
compared to trypsin.27,44−46,48 In our initial experiments, we tested Asp-N and Glu-C
and digested a HeLa lysate, while a previously published trypsin data
set was used as a reference.47 Noteworthy,
the median Mw of all identified peptides
was found to be around 1.9 kDa for Glu-C and Asp-N, an increase of
about 25% compared to 1.5 kDa median Mw for trypsin (Figure S-2, Table S-1).
Although this increase in median Mw is
significant, ideally we would generate for middle-down proteomics
peptides with a median Mw > 3 kDa,
and
thus, the results obtained were found to be suboptimal. Therefore,
we also set out to explore other means to generate peptides from proteins,
using a nonenzymatic digestion.

Testing a Nonenzymatic
Digestion for the Generation of Middle-Range
Sized Peptides
Chemical cleavage methods have been used as
an alternative to enzymatic proteolysis to generate peptides from
proteins.35 In acid-induced chemical digestion,
proteins are incubated at high temperatures in formic acid (FA) diluted
solutions.36,49 Diluted FA was reported to
cleave proteins mainly at the C-termini of aspartic acid (D).36 We hypothesized that, due to this specificity,
FA-induced digestion would potentially yield peptides of middle-sized
length.35 To our knowledge, acid-induced
chemical digestion has not been generally explored in full complex
proteome analysis.50,51 Interestingly, the median Mw of all identified peptides in the FA induced
digestion was similar to Asp-N and Glu-C. In addition, the frequency
of occurrence of missed cleaved peptides was on par with that for
the Glu-C digest data sets (Figure S-2).

Adapting Cleanup and Chromatographic Conditions To Maximize
the Retention and Separation of Middle-Range Sized Peptides
Once a considerable population of middle-range sized peptides is
generated, it is crucial to avoid their loss in the subsequent steps
of the proteomics workflow. The in silicoMw distributions generated based on the Asp-N
and Glu-C specificities are 2.39 and 2.37 kDa, respectively. We analyzed
experimental data obtained from previous in-depth proteomics studies
generated by Asp-N and Glu-C and a much lower average Mw value was found.52,53 We thus hypothesized
that
this discrepancy can be caused by losses of middle-range sized peptides
which can be due to suboptimal separation chemistry being used for
sample cleanup, prefractionation, and/or for the choice of unfavorable
LC conditions. We thus optimized a range of steps in the proteomics
workflow (Figure S-1), prior to MS detection,
which were aimed to minimize the losses of middle-range sized peptides.
When dealing with these peptides, one of the main aspects to consider
is their ability of being adsorbed (mass transfer) and efficiently
separated by the porous particles used in the employed chromatographic
techniques. A poor choice of pore size will thus result in inadequate
retention and loss of resolution. Conventionally, particles with 80–120
Å pore sizes are used for the separation of tryptic peptides.
However, a more appropriate pore size for the separation of middle-range
sized peptides is 300 Å, as has been previously reported.54 We therefore decided to test the latter pore
size material for peptide desalting with solid-phase extraction (SPE)
columns, prefractionation, and reversed phase chromatography.

Strong
Cation Exchange as a Selective Prefractionation Mode
for Middle-Range Sized Peptides
For in depth proteomics studies,
typically one or more fractionation steps are included to decrease
sample complexity and boost the number of identifications.53,55−57 When evaluating options for multidimensional separation
schemes used in proteomics approaches, we prioritized binding and
separation of longer peptides with high frequency of basic residues
in order to match our digested peptide populations. We, thus, hypothesized
that SCX at low pH (typically ∼3) could be appropriate as a
fractionation technique. As initially hypothesized, we found a good
correlation between the charge and the Mw of the peptides generated by the alternative digestions (Figure S-3a). Interestingly, for middle-down
proteomics approaches, the above-described correlation can be exploited
by selecting the appropriate fractions containing peptides of higher Mw.

Optimizing the Pore Size for the Separation
of Middle-Range
Sized Peptides
We first set up a side-by-side comparison
between the conventional reversed phase (RP) C18 material and the
300 Å pore size material, using the same stationary phase chemistry
in order to test if the difference in pore size generates a bias against
higher Mw peptides. For the comparison,
the same amount of Asp-N SCX fractions was injected and identical
MS/MS settings were used. We monitored the achieved peak capacity,
retention of middle-range sized peptides, the attainable back pressure
(see Supporting Information), the overall
retention times, and the total number of identifications (Figure S-4a). Only a modest decrease in the overall
peak capacity (about 8%) was observed using the 300 Å pore size
column. However, when focusing on peptides with Mw > 4 kDa, improved peak widths and increased area
under
the curves (AUCs) were generally observed (Figure S-4b), ratifying the choice of the 300 Å pore size column
for these peptides. The 300 Å pore size column marginally outperformed
the conventional RP C18 column in terms of number of identified proteins
(4895 vs 4722) and peptides (34 307 vs 32 907). Focusing
on peptides identified exclusively with each of the columns, the better
performance of the larger pore size material for middle-sized peptides
became clearly visible (Figure S-3b). The
300 Å pore size column retained and eluted more efficiently peptides
with Mw > 1.5 kDa, confirming our hypothesis
that conventional pore size materials typically used for the separation
of tryptic peptides negatively affects the retention and separation
of middle-range sized peptides.

Tuning MS Settings for
Improving the Detection of Middle-Range
Sized Peptides
Next, we evaluated several combinations of
MS settings, which we thought could be optimized for the detection
of middle-range sized peptides. We used the high-field Orbitrap analyzer,
which enables higher resolution compared to the previous Orbitrap
version at the same transient length and is advantageous for the analysis
of larger peptides.58 We evaluated the
effects of resolution settings, for both MS and MS/MS scans, on the
total number of peptide identifications, particularly the identification
success rate of middle-range sized peptides and instrument duty cycle.
For this comparison, several Asp-N SCX fractions, containing pools
of peptides with distinct charge states, were chosen. We evaluated
three methods varying the resolution at both the MS and MS/MS level
(Table S-3). By increasing the resolution
for MS/MS scans, we obtained a higher number of unique peptides, higher
spectral quality (higher XCorr medians), and more middle-range sized
peptides for any of the analyzed peptide population (Table S-3, top). Applying higher resolution for MS scans only
resulted in a lower number of identified unique peptides, largely
due to the lower duty cycle (Table S-3,
bottom). Thus, our experiments showed that the chosen higher resolution
setting in the MS/MS mode is essential to correctly measure the isotope
spacing associated with each ion fragment, improving the identification
rates of especially highly charged, longer peptides. Furthermore,
we opted to evaluate the effect of longer MS/MS injection times to
increase the number of detectable ion fragments and therefore improve
peptide sequence coverage. We tested 3 maximum injection times ranging
from 75 (typical value for shotgun experiments) to 125 ms with the
latter allowing us to increase the sequence fragmentation coverage
from 88% to 91% and almost no consequences on the number of unique
peptides identified (Table S-4). Optimized
method parameters can be found in Table S-5.

Exploring the Benefits of Multiple Fragmentation Methods for
the Detection of Middle-Range Sized Peptides
We evaluated
the performance of a number of fragmentation methods in identifying
middle-range sized peptides from the Asp-N, Glu-C, and FA HeLa digests
(Figure 1). In each
of these analyses, HCD fragmentation gave the highest number of unique
peptides identified, which is an inherent effect due to its shorter
duty cycle (twice as many MS/MS scans) compared to ETD and EThcD (Table S-1). However, EThcD showed superior success
rates, defined as the number of PSMs divided by the total number of
MS/MS acquired. The EThcD success rate was above 55% for both Asp-N
and Glu-C, while ETD and HCD success rates were considerably lower,
about 36%. Higher score distributions were also obtained for EThcD
across the entire Mw range (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Performance of the fragmentation
techniques (ETD, EThcD, and HCD)
with respect to peptide Mw in each of
the 3 applied digestion protocols. The comparison is based on the
number of identified unique peptides as well as on the quality of
spectra represented by their XCorr distribution (box plots).

We further calculated the peptide
sequence coverages for each digestion
method achieved with all the fragmentation methods (Figure 2). The median peptide sequence
fragmentation coverage of HCD was 65%, followed by ETD with 82% of
coverage. EThcD displayed medians of sequence fragmentation coverage
of 95%. This is partly due to the contribution of multiple ion series
(c/z and b/y),10 advantageous especially
for middle-range sized peptides because they enable unambiguous sequence
determination and multiple PTMs identification and site localization.59,60 We focused again on distinct Mw subclasses,
peptides displaying a Mw < 2.5 kDa,
and peptides with 2.5 < Mw < 4 kDa,
and the latter classification contains peptides with Mw > 4 kDa (Figure S-5b–d, respectively). Strikingly, for peptides identified at Mw > 4 kDa, the median peptide sequence coverage obtained
by EThcD was constantly around 90%, confirming its unique potential
for middle-down proteomics.

Figure 2 Peptide sequence fragmentation coverage obtained
by each fragmentation
method in the 3 applied digestion schemes. The median peptide sequence
fragmentation coverage was calculated and represented taking into
consideration all the SCX fractions for each digestion scheme.

Next to the peptide sequence coverage
obtained by a single fragmentation
method, we specifically looked at the performance of each sequencing
technique in terms of number of unique peptides identified and XCorr
distribution with respect to charge (z) and Mw ranges (Figures 3, S-6, and S-7). The score distributions
and therefore the quality of the EThcD spectra are superior in all
the studied ranges, while they yielded more identified peptides for
the higher charge states (z 5 to 7). Interestingly,
EThcD outperformed the other techniques also for lower charged peptides
(z 2 to 4). The potential of ETD for the identification
of peptides with Mw < 3 kDa, especially
for highly charged peptides (z ≥ +5), is clear
even though the quality of the spectra is lower than with EThcD fragmentation.
Additionally, as expected, the power of HCD for highly charged peptides
is diminished compared to +2 and +3 charge states.

Figure 3 Performance of the peptide
fragmentation techniques ETD, EThcD,
and HCD for peptides with respect to their Mw and charge states (z). Combined data from
Asp-N, Glu-C, and FA HeLa digests whereby the fragmentation parameters
for ETD, EThcD, and HCD were optimized. The number of identifications
as well as the XCorr distribution (as a measure for spectra quality)
are categorized by their z and Mw ranges.

During data dependent MS/MS triggering, the abundance of
low mass
peptides in the mixture can obscure the precursor selection and thus
fragmentation of middle-range sized peptides.62 We showed the correlation between charge state of peptides and their Mw (Figure S-3a) and
reasoned that triggering MS/MS based on the highest charge state peptides
present in the MS scan would further favor the detection of middle-range
sized peptides. We evaluated the performance of this method compared
to the usual intensity-based method with Asp-N SCX fractions. Indeed,
not only did the peptide Mw median increase
by 0.13 kDa by using the charge dependent MS/MS but also we could
increase the number of total identified peptides (Figure S-8).

We also evaluated the success rate for
each fragmentation technique
with respect to Mw of peptide (Figure 4). The analysis confirmed
the greater performance of EThcD for middle-down range peptides and
of ETD especially for Mw > 6 kDa. However,
despite these improved performances for longer peptides, the identification
rates seem to drastically decrease at Mw > 4 kDa. One major cause of the decline in efficiency of identification
for larger peptides has been related to the need of an increasing
ion population required to maintain signal-to-noise for the generated
fragment ion species.61 The data suggests
our workflow is allowing the transmission of a considerable number
of middle range peptides, but MS/MS efficiency is found to limit identification
rates.

Figure 4 Ions selected for MS/MS fragmentation matched to PSMs binned by
peptide Mw. The % (in blue) of precursors
matched to PSMs is calculated for each Mw bin for all the different fragmentations after merging all data
sets from the different digestions. The data clearly indicate the
superior performance of EThcD at the higher Mw bins.

Effect of Isotope Deconvolution
on Mascot and Sequest for the
Identification of Middle-Range Peptides
Triggered by our
analysis of success rate with respected to Mw, showing that a great part of the precursors with Mw > 4 kDa is not readily identified, we questioned
if we could improve the identification of the high Mw precursors (thus highly charged too) by isotope deconvolution
of the MS/MS spectra and use of alternative search engines. Fragmentation
spectra of highly charged and high Mw precursors
potentially contain multiply charged fragment ions, which are often
weighted differently/weaker than singly charged ions by certain search
engines.63 We applied the H-Score script
to our data,64 searched with the digestion
specificity that was dictated by our observation (summarized above,
in Figure 5 for Asp-N
and similarly in Figure S-9 for the other
digestions). We compared the number of unique peptides identified,
XCorr distribution, and Mw median for
increasing Mw ranges (Figure 5 for Asp-N and Figure S-9 for all data, Table S-6). Our analysis showed that deconvolution of the
MS/MS leads to a decrease in XCorr distribution and number of unique
peptides identified, while the median of Mw did not significantly increase. Most likely, the decrease in performance
of deconvoluted data is due to the cross-correlation algorithm used
by Sequest which rewards data rich spectra irrespective of redundancy
with respect to fragments present with a range of charge states.65 We thus performed the same comparison, with
the well-known, probability-based search engine Mascot. In this case,
we obtained an increase of unique peptides identified, Mascot score
distributions, and Mw medians of identified
peptides for all the digestions and fragmentation techniques (Figure 5 for Asp-N and Figure S-9 for all data, Table S-6). Interestingly, the score distribution was found
to be very similar for all 3 fragmentation schemes, perhaps a product
of the probability-based scoring. This clearly indicates that Mascot
benefits of the isotope deconvolution of multiply charged ions as
has been reported previously.63 Nevertheless,
the results were comparable to those obtained with Sequest and no
deconvolution.

Figure 5 Effect of deconvolution on Sequest and Mascot searches
for the
identification of Asp-N middle-range peptides. Specific searches were
performed by Sequest HT and Mascot on the Asp-N HeLa digestions data
sets for each of the optimized fragmentation methods (ETD, EThcD,
and HCD). The number of identifications as well as the XCorr distribution
(as a measure for spectra quality) are categorized by their Mw ranges for deconvoluted and nondeconvoluted
spectra searched by Sequest HT and Mascot.

Conclusions
Here, we present a step-by-step tuning
of the “standard”
bottom-up proteomics workflow with the aim to improve the generation,
separation, detection, and identification of middle-down range peptides.
We first show that one of the main barriers for the development of
middle-down proteomics is the generation of the desired peptides (3.5
kDa < Mw < 10 kDa). A substantial
gain in median Mw of the peptides can
be made by using Glu-C and Asp-N instead of trypsin, although the
median Mw then still only reaches ∼2
kDa. Alternatively, we generated peptides by formic acid-induced digestion.
This approach, which had not yet been explored at a proteome-wide
scale, provides an alternative for creating peptides, on par in number
of achievable peptide and protein identifications with enzyme based
approaches, although it suffers from efficiency/sensitivity issues.
Interestingly, the average Mw of the peptides
generated in the FA digest was found to be similar to that of the
Asp-N and Glu-C digests. We next showed that the detection of these
longer peptides could be improved by using an optimized SCX separation
method and columns packed with larger pore size materials. In testing
fragmentation methods, we demonstrate the excellent performance of
EThcD for the analysis of middle-range sized peptides, not only presenting
the highest identification rate (up to 57% success rate) but also
providing higher peptide sequence coverage (up to 95% peptide sequence
fragmentation coverage) compared to HCD and ETD fragmentations methods.
Furthermore, the Mascot search engine benefited from deconvolution
while Sequest showed a minor negative effect. Nevertheless, we also
found that the number of effectively identified precursors seems to
decrease at higher Mw (>4 kDa) across
all fragmentation techniques, suggesting that the MS/MS sequencing
may be the major limiting factor in our workflow. Cumulatively, the
optimizations made here in peptide generation, separation, detection,
fragmentation, and identification expand the number of unambiguous
identifications of especially the middle-size range peptides and,
therefore, are a major step forward toward an optimized workflow for
middle-down proteomics.
