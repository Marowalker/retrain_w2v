Androgens
are essential for male development and reproductive function.
They are transported to their site of action as blood-borne endocrine
hormones but can also be produced within tissues to act in intracrine
and paracrine fashions. Because of this, circulating concentrations
may not accurately reflect the androgenic influence within specific
tissue microenvironments. Mass spectrometry imaging permits regional
analysis of small molecular species directly from tissue surfaces.
However, due to poor ionization and localized ion suppression, steroid
hormones are difficult to detect. Here, derivatization with Girard
T reagent was used to charge-tag testosterone and 5α-dihydrotestosterone
allowing direct detection of these steroids in mouse testes, in both
basal and maximally stimulated states, and in rat prostate. Limits
of detection were ∼0.1 pg for testosterone. Exemplary detection
of endogenous steroids was achieved by matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization and either Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance detection
(at 150 μm spatial resolution) or quadrupole-time-of-flight
detection (at 50 μm spatial resolution). Structural confirmation
was achieved by collision induced fragmentation following liquid extraction
surface analysis and electrospray ionization. This application broadens
the scope for derivatization strategies on tissue surfaces to elucidate
local endocrine signaling in health and disease.

==== Body
Androgens are essential regulators
of male development and adult reproductive function, primarily synthesized
within the testis. During embryonic development, testicular fetal
Leydig and Sertoli cells work in concert to produce testosterone.1,2 This is converted into the most active androgen, 5α-dihydrotestosterone
(DHT), by 5α-reductases in peripheral tissues to promote masculinization
and normal size of target organs.3−5 In postnatal life, a
second population of (adult) Leydig cells develops superseding the
fetal population; these Leydig cells complete all steps of steroidogenesis
to produce and secrete testosterone throughout adulthood.6 Additional androgens, androstenedione (A4) and
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), are synthesized in the adrenal glands
in many species but not rats or mice.7,8 Androgens have
pleiotropic functions in the testis, e.g., completion of meiosis,
differentiation of spermatids, initiation of spermatogenesis at puberty,
and maintenance of this process in the adult.9 Dysregulation of these processes may lead to testicular dysfunction
and infertility. In contrast, increased androgen signaling plays a
role in pathologies, including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
and prostate cancer.10,11

Liquid chromatography-tandem
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is the
method of choice for quantifying circulating androgens, but little
information is available relating circulating to tissue levels due
to analytical limitations. While androgens may be quantified in extracts
of biopsies,7,12 this does not spatially align
steroid levels with subregions, e.g., cell types or tumors. Retaining
spatial distribution of androgens can be crucial, for example, in
androgen-sensitive prostate tumors, where the cellular activities
of 5α-reductases are critical to the local exposure to DHT.
Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is gaining traction as a bioanalytical
tool to map spatial distribution of small molecules in tissues and
identify, localize, and relatively quantitate compounds in complex
biological matrices.13 Many small molecule
applications of MSI pertain to drug discovery, but we recently validated
a MSI approach for assessing the spatial distribution of glucocorticoids
in murine brain.14 On-tissue chemical derivatization
(OTCD) using Girard T (GirT) reagent overcame poor target ionization
efficiency and ion suppression, and the increased m/z helped avoid interference of matrix-related background
in the lower mass range. GirT reagent reacts with ketones15 and enhances sensitivity in the measurement
of lipophilic steroids within tissue matrix, but the approach requires
skillful and flexible manual application. Glucocorticoids are pregnene
steroids, with several ketones, the most reactive being at C3 in the
A-ring, conjugated with a C4–5 double bond (Nomenclature of
steroids, Figure S-1). The endogenous androgens,
testosterone and androstenedione, contain a similar ketonic function
and may also be derivatized using hydrazine-based reagents15 (Derivatization Reactions, Figure S-1). A recent report suggests derivatization with
GirT is useful for MSI of testosterone in tissue.16 However, within tissue, testosterone levels must be interpreted
in conjunction with those of the more potent DHT. The A-ring of DHT
is reduced, and the ketone is less activated (not allylic to the Δ4–5
double bond) and thus less amenable to derivatization.

Here,
we describe how OTCD with MSI can spatially localize testosterone
and DHT in rodent reproductive tissues. Translational challenges and
methodological improvements to reduce diffusion and increase robustness
by inclusion of automated spraying technology are reported for the
first time.

Experimental Section
Sources of Chemicals
Internal standard
[2H]8-corticosterone-2,2,4,6,6,7,21,21 (d8-CORT) was from Cambridge Isotopes, MA, USA;
unlabeled
steroids were obtained from Steraloids Inc., PA, USA. Solvents were
glass-distilled HPLC grade (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK).
Other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich (Dorset, UK) unless stated.
Room temperature (RT) was 18–21 °C.

Animals and
Biomatrix Collection
C57BL/6 mice (Harlan
Olac Ltd., Bicester, UK) were studied under UK Home Office license.
To stimulate androgen biosynthesis, human chorionic gonadotrophin
(hCG, 20 IU, Organon, The Netherlands) or vehicle (saline) was administered
by subcutaneous injection to male mice (aged 8–10 weeks; n = 3/group) and testes and blood were collected following
cull by CO2 16 h later. Plasma (EDTA) was prepared by centrifugation
(10 000g, 5 min, 4 °C). Tissues were
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored (−80 °C). Concentrations
of testosterone in plasma were quantified by LC-MS/MS.17 Prostates were similarly collected from male
Sprague–Dawley rats (Harlan Olac Ltd.).

Reaction Efficiency: LC-MS/MS
Analysis of Nonderivatized and
Derivatized Steroids
Steroid (1 μg/10 μL methanol)
was derivatized with GirT (5 mg/mL in methanol containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA)) by heating (40 °C, 60 min), and the reaction was
stopped with water (50 μL). Nonderivatized and derivatized steroids
were analyzed by LC-MS/MS (QTrap 5500 triple quadrupole MS (Sciex,
Warrington, UK) interfaced with an Acquity UPLC (Waters, Manchester,
UK)). Separation was achieved using a Kinetix C18 column (Phenomenex,
Macclesfield, UK; 150 cm, 3 mm, 2.6 μm; 35 °C). Initial
mobile phase conditions were water with 0.1% formic acid/methanol
(70:30), changing to 20:80 from 1 to 10 min, and then sustained until
15.5 min. Selected ion monitoring detected nonderivatized and derivatized
steroids, respectively, testosterone (m/z 289.1, 402.3) and DHT (m/z 291.1,
404.2) with electrospray (ESI) MS (source temperature, 30 °C;
ion source gases GS1 and GS2 (50 and 70, respectively); CAD low; ion
spray voltage, 5500 V; curtain gas, 40 psi; entrance potential, 10
V).

Imaging Instrumentation
MSI was performed first by
12T SolariX MALDI-FTICR-MS (Bruker Daltonics, MA, US) employing a
Smartbeam 1 kHz laser, operated with SolariX control v1.5.0 (build
42.8), Hystar 3.4 (build 8), and FlexImaging v3.0 (build 42). Confirmatory
on-tissue collision induced dissociation (CID) was carried out by
liquid extraction surface analysis (LESA)-nanoESI-FTICR-MS (Triversa
Nanomate, Advion, New York, USA). Secondly high spatial resolution
imaging was performed using a MALDI q-TOF MS (MALDI Synapt G2 HDMS,
Waters). Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined. Image files were
generated in Mass Lynx (v4.1) and then viewed in HDI Imaging (v1.2).

Tissue Sectioning and Mounting
Tissue was embedded
in gelatin (50% w/v). Top-down (horizontal) sections of testes (10
μm) were thaw mounted onto conductive indium tin-oxide (ITO)-coated
glass slides (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, GmbH) and stored in a vacuum
desiccator (RT, 1 h) and then at −80 °C. Adjacent sections
were stained using hematoxylin and eosin. After fixation in cold acetone,
tissue sections were examined using an optical microscope (40×,
Leica Microsystems Inc., Bannockburn, IL, USA) with CCD camera (Hitachi,
3969, Japan).

Detection of Endogenous Steroids in Rodent
Tissues without Derivatization
Tissues were prepared and
matrix applied (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic
acid; CHCA) as below.

Detection of Endogenous Steroids in Rodent
Tissues Following
OTCD
From −80 °C, tissue sections were dried
in a vacuum desiccator (20 min). Derivatization reagent (GirT, 5 mg/mL
methanol/water (80:20) with 0.1% TFA containing d8-CORT (10 μg/mL)) was applied by an artistic airbrush,14 with a reagent density of 0.11 mg/cm2. The procedure for reagent and matrix application14 was automated for higher resolution imaging. The reagent
was applied (flow rate 90 μL/min) by an automated sprayer (HTX
Technologies, Carrboro, North Carolina, US). Nebulization gas was
nitrogen (10 psi). The nozzle spray (100 °C, positioned ∼35
mm from the target) was deposited (linear velocity, 850 mm/min; offset
spacing, 3 mm). Ten passes were performed leading to a matrix density
of 0.21 mg/cm2, matched to manual matrix spraying.14 On alternate passes, the spray pattern was offset
by 1.8 mm. After derivatization, the slide was placed in a temperature/humidity
controlled chamber (Memmert HPP 110, Schwabach, GmbH; 40 °C,
80% relative humidity) in a sealed slide box. The tissue was incubated
(60 min, 40 °C) and then allowed to cool and dry in a vacuum
desiccator (RT, 15 min) to remove the condensed water prior to matrix
deposition.

Matrix Application
CHCA (10 mg/mL
in acetonitrile (80%)
+ 0.2% v/v TFA) was applied by a pneumatic TLC sprayer (20 mL/slide;
nitrogen flow, 7.5 L/min; distance 20 cm from target). Each manual
pass took ∼1 s and was repeated with 5–10 s between
passes, until uniform coating was achieved. The tissue section was
allowed to dry (RT) and stored in a desiccator. For higher resolution
studies, the matrix was applied by an automated sprayer as above except
that the nozzle was 90 °C and linear velocity was 1100 mm/min.

MALDI-FTICR-MSI Analysis
Optical images were scanned
(Canon LiDE-20, Canon, UK). MSI analysis was performed using constant
accumulation of selected ions (CASI) using a 80 Da isolation window
centered at 435 Da yielding a 2 Mword time-domain transient. Laser
spot diameter was 100 μm, and raster spacing was 100–300
μm. Laser shots were 800 and power optimized for consistent
ion production. MSI data were subject to window normalization to m/z of 468.3064 (GirT-d8-CORT). Mass precision was typically ±0.0005 Da.
Average abundances were assigned from the summed spectra within ROIs.
Neutral testosterone and DHT were analyzed (without derivatization)
in positive mode at m/z 289.2098
and m/z 291.2112. Ions of derivatives
were monitored in positive mode: m/z 402.3115 (GirT-testosterone) and 404.3271 (GirT-DHT). The CHCA matrix
ions at positive m/z 417.0483, along
with GirT-d8-CORT, were monitored to assess
uniformity of matrix application.

Higher Spatial Resolution
Analysis
Using a MALDI q-TOF
MS, the ROI was defined and the spatial resolution set (50 μm).
Positive ion data were acquired in sensitivity mode (target enhancement
at m/z 402) with 350 laser shots/raster
position using a 1 kHz laser. Optimization was achieved by tuning
acquisition settings while collecting data from a control spot of
analytes (0.5 μL, 0.1 g/mL of standard at ∼2 μm
manually spotted with an equal volume of derivatization solution/matrix).
Ions formed by derivatives were monitored in positive mode: m/z 402.31 (GirT-testosterone) and m/z 404.33 (GirT-DHT). Mass filter windows
were selected with a precision of ±0.04 Da. Data were normalized
by total ion current.

Liquid Extraction Surface Analysis (LESA)-ESI-FTICR-MS
Steroids within tissue sections were derivatized14 and analyzed immediately using LESA-nanoESI-FTICR-MS with
the 12T SolariX ESI-MALDI source: solvent, methanol/water, 50:50 with
0.1% v/v of formic acid; pick-up volume, 1.5 μL; dispense volume,
1.2 μL at 0.2 mm from surface; droplet rest time (delay), 5
s; aspiration volume of 1.4 μL at 0.0 mm from surface. Ions
were detected between m/z 250 and
1500, with an isolation window of 0.1 Da, yielding a 2 Mword time-domain
transient. Ions of GirT-hydrazones (as MALDI) were isolated (30 s)
prior to selection of m/z 400.3
± 5 for CID performed at 32 eV.

Limits of Detection
Limits of detection were assessed
by spotting serial dilutions of steroid solutions (0.1–100
pg) onto slides and also control sections (murine brain) and assessed
by MALDI-FTICR-MS. Data were compared using Student’s t-test (Statistica version 8.0, StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK,
USA).

Results and Discussion
Mass Spectral Characterization of Steroids
The mass
spectra of nonderivatized androgen standards contained protonated
molecular ions (testosterone, m/z 289.2098; DHT, m/z 291.2112).
Initial imaging attempts to detect nonderivatized androgens in mouse
testes were unsuccessful, as signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) < 2 (Figure 1b,g), even following
hCG stimulation. This resembles glucocorticoids, which are also undetectable
in their native state by ourselves14 and
others.16 Accordingly, GirT derivatives
were formed and reactions were monitored using ESI, which allowed
concomitant assessment of native and derivatized forms. With ESI,
the steroid signal intensities were boosted by ∼20–30×
by derivatization. However, reaction efficiencies differed with DHT,
reacting ∼5 times more slowly than testosterone, due to its
less reactive 3-ketone.

and as Girard T derivatives in murine testes. Nonderivatized steroids
could not be detected testes even following stimulation with human
chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). However, upon derivatization, testosterone

Reaction conditions were
subsequently optimized on-tissue using
testosterone. The MALDI MS spectra of the GirT-hydrazones yielded
[M]+ ions, with masses at m/z 402.3114 for testosterone (Figure 1k) and m/z 404.3264
for DHT (Figure 1l),
in close agreement with theoretical masses. As before, GirT derivatives
yielded spectra dominated by the molecular ion and high resolution
MS overcame the challenge of selecting specific analytes from high
abundance ions in the low mass range emanating from matrix and tissue.
Structural confirmation was performed within tissue by CID using LESA-ESI-FTICR-MS,
allowing isolation experiments to be performed with greater sensitivity
than could be achieved during MALDI imaging (CID mass spectra, Figure S-2). CID of GirT-testosterone generated
fragment ions (m/z 343 and 315)
characteristic of loss of the quaternary amine tag [M-59]+ and carbon monoxide [M-87]+, respectively, from the derivatized
group. Similar fragmentation occurred with GirT-DHT. Proposed patterns
(Proposed Fragmentation Patterns, Figure S-2) agreed with the fragmentations of GirT derivatives of glucocorticoids14 and also those of GirP steroid hydrazones, which
may form stable five membered rings.18 Further
androgens (androstenedione, DHEA) were also successfully derivatized
with GirT (Mass spectrum, Figure S-3).
Notably, GirT-DHEA gave the same precursor ion as testosterone and
fragmented similarly under LESA conditions, unless high energy was
applied.

OTCD and matrix application were adapted for automated
spraying,
allowing greater control of crystal size and topological homogeneity,
aiming to improve spatial resolution and reduce the likelihood of
hot spots. Previously, deposition of methanolic solutions was by either
a manual TLC sprayer or airbrushes, where the distance from target
and nozzle–nozzle reproducibility were difficult to control,
varying between suppliers and even lots. Nonetheless, a good spray
mist could be achieved, leading to a homogeneous layer of reagent,
good analyte extraction, and desirable cocrystallization. However,
reproducibility was highly analyst dependent and analyte diffusion
was a concern through repeated wetting.

Sublimation (solvent-free)
was piloted, leading to smaller crystal
size but poor tissue-extraction, particularly with hydrophobic analytes.
Shimma et al. report a successful dual approach of sublimation and
airbrushing to reduce crystal size.16 Ultimately,
automated deposition was used, improving reproducibility and crystal
size homogeneity but requiring extensive optimization of spray parameters
(nozzle temperature, nitrogen flow, solvent composition, solvent flow
rate, surface tension) to achieve good analyte extraction. A balance
between “not too wet”, promoting diffusion, and “not
too dry”, impeding analyte extraction, was struck. Our experience
is that, while reproducibility is improved by automated spraying,
better sensitivity/extraction may still be observed using an airbrush.
Furthermore, automatic sprayers require instrument-specific optimization.

Relative Quantitation of Derivatized Steroids
CASI
was used to maximize signal intensity and limits of detection (LODs)
of derivatized testosterone were ∼0.1 pg (off-tissue) and 1
pg (on-tissue; SNR 21). GirT derivatives of testosterone yielded ions
of similar intensity to GirT-d8-CORT;
similar ionization efficiency is anticipated,14 for steroids with an activated A-ring ketone. However, the yield
of GirT-DHT was lower due to reduced reactivity of the nonconjugated
ketone moiety. Therefore, relative quantitation between testosterone
and DHT requires normalization, readily achievable with stable-isotope
labeled internal standards. 13C labeling is preferred to
deuterium due to the potential for loss of deuterium during derivatization
or fragmentation.19

Detection of Endogenous
Steroids in Rodent Tissues
GirT derivatives of androgens
were successfully detected using two
imaging MS platforms. Initially, studies were performed by MSI (with
FTICR) at 150 μm spatial resolution in murine testes, detecting
steroids with mass accuracy of ±5 ppm from their theoretical
monoisotopic mass (Figure 1k,l). Androgens were detected in control testes (Figure 1c,h) with SNR of
22 ± 5 and 43.5 ± 4 for derivatized testosterone and DHT,
respectively. Testosterone and DHT were in higher abundance following
stimulation with hCG (Figure 1d,i) and SNR, 265 ± 11 and 387 ± 13, respectively.
The absolute signal intensity of testosterone and DHT relative to d8-CORT was increased ∼2.5- and ∼1.8-fold
by hCG (Figure 1e,j),
respectively. Corresponding concentrations of testosterone in plasma
rose from 4.5 ± 0.7 to 29.6 ± 1.8 nM following hCG, typical
of the protocol.20 Shimma et al. reported
an increase of greater magnitude but over a shorter timecourse.16

depicted by color on the scale shown. Scale bar (2 mm).

The distributions of testosterone and DHT following
hCG stimulation
were assessed at higher spatial resolution (50 μm) using a MALDI-q-TOF
instrument. In CASI mode on the SolariX (800 laser shots/pixel), a
decline in sensitivity after 20 000 pixels was observed, possibly
due to an accumulation of matrix/reagent ion clusters in the source;
this was not observed by qTOF-MS. The steroid derivatives yielded
the same molecular ions as with FTICR. The mass resolution was ∼20 000
(at m/z 400) as opposed to 350 000,
and the difference in mass accuracy of selected ions was <5 ppm
versus their theoretical monoisotopic masses (Figure 2g). Potential interfering ions within the
mass window were not evident in either the qTOF or the FTICR spectra
from mouse testes. DHT was also detected but with a different spatial
distribution. Testosterone was mainly localized within the seminiferous
tubules (Figure 2a,c),
while DHT was mainly observed in the interstitium/Leydig cells (Figure 2b,d). Although Shimma
et al.16 report Leydig cell localization
of testosterone, their images display a clear signal in seminiferous
tubules, in keeping with ours.

The method was subsequently applied
to prostate tissue. 5α-Reductases
are pharmacological targets within prostate, since suppression of
DHT production attenuates growth of both hyperplastic and cancerous
tissue. Both testosterone and DHT could be detected SNR > 10 (Figure 1n–p), suggesting
that the MSI approach may open doors to pathological investigations
of cell-specific androgen synthesis in prostate disease.

Conclusions
Derivatization permits detection of poorly ionizable endogenous
androgens in target tissues by MSI. The use of Gir T reagent affords
low limits of detection, similar to glucocorticoids.14 OTCD proceeded rapidly for testosterone but was less efficient
for DHT. However, both steroids were detected in tissue. For relative
quantitation, commercial stable-isotope labeled androgens would allow
data collection within a narrower mass window of ±5 or 10 Da
(as opposed to 80 Da using d8-CORT), potentially
improving sensitivity.

OTCD coupled with MALDI-FTICR-MSI successfully
detected androgens
in murine testes. A proof-of-principle experiment, representative
of healthy biological variations in tissue steroid levels, was performed
using hCG to maximally stimulate androgen synthesis, achieving an
increase in plasma testosterone which was also reflected in testicular
steroids. Initial studies were performed at 150 μm resolution,
detecting androgens in testes but without meaningful molecular histology.
The seminiferous tubules of mice are ∼300 μm in diameter,
and hence, smaller laser bores were required to reveal the characteristic
tissue structure, although this may be less challenging in larger
species. Higher resolution imaging (50 μm) localized testosterone
and DHT to different compartments of the adult mouse testis.

The need for higher resolution imaging brings with it concerns
over analyte diffusion, matrix crystal size, and tissue integrity.
Manual application of matrix and reagent, while effective, was subject
to variability between operators. The automated application allows
better tissue–tissue reproducibility and improved homogeneity
of matrix coverage compared with TLC sprayers or airbrushes. Future
optimization of OTCD and matrix application by sublimation may allow
even higher spatial resolution, possibly 5 μm approaching cellular
resolution, now obtainable with new MALDI systems.

MSI with
OTCD is a powerful tool to study the regional variation
in abundance of androgens in tissues, and here, we broaden the scope
of the technique to reproductive biology. In translating to nonrodent
tissues, the presence of isobaric steroids and highly abundant DHEA,
as well as epi-testosterone, must be considered. Although underivatized
DHEA fragments differently from testosterone under tandem MS conditions,
the predominant fragment of the derivatives within FTICR or the qTOF
is the derivatizing group, militating against their discrimination
in the absence of chromatography. Other approaches such as MSn as
reported with the IMScope16 or ion mobility
may permit isomeric separation, as required by translational research.
