The common selenium oxoanions selenite
(SeO32–) and selenate (SeO42–) are toxic at
intake levels slightly below 1 mg day–1. These anions
are currently monitored by a variety of traditional analytical techniques
that are time-consuming, expensive, require large sample volumes,
and/or lack portability. To address the need for a fast and inexpensive
analysis of selenium oxoanions, we present the first microchip capillary
zone electrophoresis (MCE) separation targeting these species in the
presence of chloride, sulfate, nitrate, nitrite, chlorate, sulfamate,
methanesulfonate, and fluoride, which can be simultaneously monitored.
The chemistry was designed to give high selectivity in nonideal matrices.
Interference from common weak acids is avoided by operating near pH
4. Separation resolution from chloride was enhanced to improve tolerance
of high-salinity matrices. As a result, selenate can be quantified
in the presence of up to 1.5 mM NaCl, and selenite analysis is even
more robust against chloride. Using contact conductivity detection,
detection limits for samples with conductivity equal to the background
electrolyte are 53 nM (4.2 ppb Se) and 380 nM (30 ppb) for selenate
and selenite, respectively. Analysis time, including injection, is
∼2 min. The MCE method was validated against ion chromatography
(IC) using spiked samples of dilute BBL broth and slightly outperformed
the IC in accuracy while requiring <10% of the analysis time. The
applicability of the technique to real samples was shown by monitoring
the consumption of selenite by bacteria incubated in LB broth.

==== Body
Selenium
is an essential trace
element with a narrow range between necessary and toxic concentrations.1,2 A dietary reference intake (DRI) of 55 μg day–1 is proposed based on plasma glutathione peroxidase activity as the
selenium biomarker.2 In excess, selenium
poisoning (selenosis) can result in neurological pathologies including
convulsions, weakness, and decreased cognitive function.3 Endemic selenosis was reported in China, where
maximal intake was estimated at 910 μg day–1.4 Thus, the window between daily essential
and toxic intake is small, at just over 1 order of magnitude. Complicating
this picture, selenium speciation versus total selenium intake is
crucial.5 Selenium oxoanions, namely selenite
(Se[IV], SeO32–) and selenate (Se[VI],
SeO42–), are water-soluble, bioavailable,
and toxic,6 resulting in a 50 ppb drinking
water limit according to the US EPA. The biological and ecological
consequences of too little or too much selenium highlight the need
for facile analytical methods to determine selenium oxoanion concentration
in real-world matrices.

Many analytical techniques can monitor
selenium speciation.7,8 Examples include electrothermal
atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS),
inductively coupled plasma with optical emission spectrometry or mass
spectrometry (ICP-OES and ICP-MS), differential pulse cathodic sweeping
voltammetry (DPCSV), hydride generation atomic absorption and atomic
fluorescence spectrometries (HGAAS and HGAFS), and UV–visible
absorbance spectroscopy (after complexation).8,9 Despite
the sensitive, selective, and expensive methods employed for selenium
speciation, preconcentration methods such as solid-phase extraction
(SPE) are generally required to increase concentrations and/or reduce
matrix interference.9

Even after
extraction and/or preconcentration, a separation step
prior to analysis is often necessary for inorganic selenium speciation.
Separation techniques include ion chromatography (IC), high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE).8,10 Chromatographic methods typically exhibit better concentration detection
limits, are not as sensitive to high-salinity matrices, and have more-established
interfaces to selective detectors. However, chromatography requires
larger sample volumes, needs longer analysis times, and can suffer
stationary phase damage from matrix species. Stationary-phase sensitivity
is especially high for biological matrices. In contrast, CE is suited
for selenium speciation due to the ionic nature of the analytes. Compared
to chromatography, it requires less sample volume, allows shorter
analysis times, and has higher mass sensitivity.11 Although CE capillaries are prone to fouling by biomacromolecules,
capillary replacement is less expensive than replacing chromatographic
columns, and there are a variety of CE surface-protection approaches
to avoid protein adsorption.12,13 Additionally, the simple
and low-power equipment used in electrophoresis lends this technique
to portable applications, particularly when performed as microchip
capillary electrophoresis (MCE).14

Thus, speed, cost, sample consumption, and portability make CE
appealing for inorganic selenium separations. However, CE methods
for selenium speciation are limited.15,16 A few methods
employ absorption or indirect fluorescent detection at basic pH.17−25 This approach is useful for simultaneously monitoring other inorganic
oxoanions (e.g., of arsenic and tellurium) and can be optimized to
avoid interference from the limited number of common inorganic anions.
However, comigrating organic anions can confound selenium oxoanion
separations at these conditions, particularly for selenite, due to
lack of selectivity in both the separation and detection steps.

Element-specific detection avoids selectivity problems arising
with optical and fluorescent detection. Frequently, inductively coupled
plasma is used for element-specific detection as either ICP-MS26−36 or with atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES).26 Direct CE-MS37,38 and atomic fluorescence
spectrometry (CE-AFS)39 are also utilized.
Although these approaches circumvent poor separation selectivity,
they require substantially greater operating expense and complexity.
An alternative is to use a simple detector coupled with a selective
background electrolyte (BGE) that improves separation resolution.

The Kubáň group analyzed selenate, selenite, chloride,
sulfate, nitrate, and nitrite in a pH 4 BGE with contactless conductivity
detection.40 At this pH, interference from
the majority of organic acids is minimized. Sladkov et al. used an
even more acidic BGE (pH 2.5) with CE-UV for selenium speciation in
wastewater.41 At this pH, all common organic
acids and most common inorganic weak acids are noninterfering. Although
both of these methods achieve selective separation, they use traditional
CE. Portability is desirable for environmental monitoring applications.
Although portable CE has been repeatedly demonstrated,42 MCE has a smaller footprint, particularly when
coupled to conductivity or electrochemical detection. However, inorganic
selenium MCE methods have not yet been developed. The only microchip
capillary zone electrophoresis selenium analysis was designed for
selenoamino acids.43 Prest et al. monitored
inorganic selenium on a microchip using isotachophoresis and contactless
conductivity detection,44,45 but this had neither
suitable resolving power nor detection limits (6–13 μM)
for many applications.

Here we report the first MCE system specifically
tailored for selective
determination of selenate and selenite. Simultaneous monitoring of
other strong anions is possible, specifically chloride, sulfate, nitrate,
nitrite, chlorate, sulfamate, fluoride, and methanesulfonate. Interference
from major organic acids is avoided by using acidic operating conditions
(pH 4) under counter electro-osmotic flow (EOF) conditions. Contact
conductivity detection is used to achieve low detection limits. The
method is designed to maximize robustness against high-chloride matrices,
with the selenite analysis being practically unaffected by chloride,
and selenate is fully resolved from chloride up to 1.5 mM. For samples
with conductivity equal to the separation BGE, selenate and the less-conductive
selenite have detection limits of 53 and 380 nM, respectively. Electrophoretic
stacking due to sample–BGE conductivity discrepancies further
improves detection limits in low-conductivity matrices. Linear ranges
span 3–4 orders of magnitude, up to 500 μM for selenite
and 1 mM for selenate. The method was tested using samples of dilute
(0.5%) BBL broth spiked with known concentrations of selenate, selenite,
nitrate, and chlorate. Results agreed with the theoretical values
and matched or outperformed IC measurements. The described method
will be useful for samples of moderate salinity but relatively low
sulfate concentrations.

Experimental Section
MCE and IC Materials
MCE BGE chemicals were purchased
in the highest purity commercially available. Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide
were obtained from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-(4-butanesulfonic acid) (HEPBS) and N-tetradecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propanesulfonate
(TDAPS) came from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Analytes were obtained
at ≥99% purity, unless noted. KCl, (NH4)2SO4, NaNO3, NaNO2, and NaClO3 were purchased from Fisher (Fair Lawn, NJ). Na2SeO4·10H2O, Na2SeO3, NaF, Na2C2O4, sulfamic acid, sodium
methanesulfonate (98%), sodium 1,2-ethanedisulfonate (EDS), sodium
pyruvate, malic acid, potassium formate, and tartaric acid were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich. Fumaric acid was procured from Fluka. Trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) was obtained from EMD (Gibbstown, NJ), and malonic acid
was purchased from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium). Ion chromatography
was performed using a Metrohm (Riverview, FL) Compact Pro 881 IC,
863 Compact IC Autosampler, MagIC Net 2.2 software, Metrosep A Supp
7 - 250/4.0 column, and suppressed conductivity detection. The isocratic
eluent was 3.6 mM Na2CO3 (primary standard grade
from Sigma-Aldrich) at 0.8 mL min–1 and 45 °C.
BBL Trypticase Soy Broth was purchased from Becton Dickinson (Sparks,
MD). Broth was prepared as directed (30 g/L) and without sterilization.
All solutions were prepared using stock chemicals and 18.2 MΩ·cm
water from a MilliPore (Billerica, MA) Milli-Q system.

Microchip Construction
and Operation
Microchips were
prepared in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) using a Sylgard 184 kit
from Dow Corning (Midland, MI). Device construction was similar to
that described in our other work using microwire electrodes and/or
contact conductivity detection,46−48 hence only specific details are
given. Figure 1 shows the microchip diagram.
Channel lengths (mm) were the following: sample = 10, buffer = 10,
waste = 30, separation = 72 (70 effective), and injector = 0.70. Nominal
channel widths and heights were 70 and 45 μm, respectively.
The detection zone expanded into a 350 μm wide bubble cell to
reduce interference from the separation field and increase signal,
which is critical for successful contact conductivity detection in
MCE.46 −4330 and −2880 V
potentials were applied in the buffer and sample reservoirs, respectively,
while keeping the other reservoirs at 0 V. These values generated
a nominal −400 V cm–1 separation field. During
injections, the waste reservoir was set to +1950 V, the sample reservoir
−84 V, and the other reservoirs 0 V to fill the double-T injector.
Injections were performed for 30 s (injection time study in Figures
S-1 and S-2, Supporting Information). Characterization
of the silicon molds with a Zygo (Middlefield, CT) ZeScope optical
profilometer showed the channel height to vary between 44 and 56 μm
(edge-bead effects induced higher (>50 μm) edge features),
and
the average width was 74.6 μm. Correcting the calculated separation
field using the measured profile gave an estimated −394 V cm–1. Conductivity detection was performed using 30-μm
Pt wires (California Fine Wire, Grover Beach, CA). Two parallel Pt
wires were placed perpendicular to the channel with 120 μm center-to-center
spacing for the conductivity cell.

in the main text.

Data Acquisition and Analysis
All high-voltage potentials
were applied using a custom-built, isolated power supply controlled
by LabView 8.6 (National Instruments, Austin, TX). Signal was measured
using a Dionex (owned by Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) CD20 detector,
and the 0–1 V analog output was read by a National Instruments
USB-6210 DAQ at 2.5 kHz with 125-sample averaging for a 20 Hz effective
collection rate. Measured background signal (for BGE 1, described
later) was 940 μS cm–1 with the CD20 set to
a (default) 160 cm–1 cell constant. The expected
background conductivity was 414 μS cm–1, indicating
an actual cell constant of 70 cm–1. This value falls
in the expected range from length/area estimates with a lower bound
(90 μm edge-to-edge electrode spacing, and channel width/depth
of 350 and 49 μm, respectively) of 51 cm–1 and upper bound (120 μm center-to-center spacing, 350 μm
channel width, and 30 μm electrode “depth”) of
114 cm–1. Detector range was 200 μS cm–1; baseline noise was limited by a detector digital-to-analog
conversion. The digital resolution was 50.4 μV, equating to
10 nS cm–1 on the CD20, 11 ppm of the background.
In contrast, the analog noise on each digital step was ∼5 μV.
For the limit-of-detection (LOD) study, the LOD signal was considered
to be two digital steps.

Raw MCE electropherogram data were
analyzed using a custom LabView program. Peak windows were manually
entered and drifting baselines (from evaporation and temperature variations)
were removed via polynomial subtraction, followed by peak integration.
Internal standards are required for reliable quantification in electrophoresis,49 so calibrations were performed by plotting the
analyte/internal standard peak area ratio versus the analyte/standard
concentration ratio. For unbiased electrophoresis injections, peak
areas are often corrected for EOF drift by dividing by the migration
time.50 However, this method was not employed
because the relatively low EOF (∼2 × 10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1) was
stable. Also, increased migration times from decreased localized electric
fields induced by peak overloading (e.g., the high end of the linearity
study) led to lower calibration curve correlations with migration-time
correction. For IC peak integration, MagIC Net 2.2 was used.

For the MCE linearity study, unweighted linear regressions and
correlation coefficients (R2) were used
for evaluation. Because selenium oxoanions are unlikely to be present
at high micromolar levels, more rigorous methods for evaluating linear
range, such as those recommended by the Analytical Division of the
Royal Society,51 were not employed. For
the simulated samples, six aqueous samples were prepared with 0–600
μM nitrate, chlorate, selenate, and selenite (selenium species
were varied together because the selenite stock contained measurable
selenate). These solutions were mixed in a ∼1:9 ratio with
a solution of BGE, internal standard, and BBL broth (spun at 14000
rpm for 10 min with a 30 kDa spin filter) for a final solution of
∼10% sample and 0.5% broth. Both the MCE and IC used six-point,
1–100 μM calibration curves. For MCE, weighted linear
regression was employed as recommended for bioanalytical methods.52 A weighting factor of concentration raised to
the −1 power was chosen instead of concentration to the −2
power because the relative concentration uncertainty increased with
decreasing concentration. Advantages of weighted regression in analytical
measurements have been previously covered.52−54 For our weighted
regressions, methods from these references were used, and the exact
procedure is covered in the Supporting Information. For IC calibration, a second-order polynomial weighted regression
was used because suppressed IC is fundamentally nonlinear.55,56 The MCE analysis of the bacterial consumption of selenite and nitrate
in LB broth was performed similarly to the BBL broth analysis. The
only significant difference was a 250× dilution used instead
of the 200× dilution.

Data-analysis procedures for analyzing
the HEPBS and TDAPS studies
are described in the Supporting Information. Briefly, PeakMaster 5.2 simulations were used to calculate the
mobility of sulfamate, which does not strongly interact with either
additive. The predicted mobility was modified to account for viscosity
differences (electrophoretic mobility is inversely proportional to
viscosity) and used to calculate the EOF. This EOF was used to compute
analyte electrophoretic mobilities, and these mobilities were adjusted
to be representative of water at 25 °C for plotting and fitting
of affinity constants.

Results and Discussion
Background Electrolyte
Development
We chose conductivity
detection to monitor analyte elution because it is inexpensive, relatively
portable, and has been demonstrated to routinely provide submicromolar
detection limits. Given that conductivity detection, like indirect
UV-absorbance, is indiscriminant, selectivity arises entirely from
the electrophoretic separation. Selenate is easily resolvable from
organic acids with MCE due to its high mobility. Only similarly mobile
inorganic species, specifically chloride, sulfate, nitrate, and nitrite,
may interfere with selenate. However, selenite, even when fully deprotonated,
comigrates with potentially dozens of organic acids common in biological
matrices, depending on the pH.57 However,
selenite’s lower pKa (2.6) is significantly
below most organics (>4), permitting the slower biselenite anion
to
be analyzed at conditions between its lower pKa and the pKa of most organic acids,
yielding fewer potential interferents. Despite the benefits of this
low-pH approach, only two reports have demonstrated its utility, one
at pH 2.5,41 and the other at pH 4.0.40 Previously, our group demonstrated that pyridine
carboxylic acid electrolytes are highly compatible with contact conductivity
detection and this low-pH approach.46 We
further improved selectivity by adding zwitterionic surfactants to
the BGE,47 eliminating interference from
weakly solvated anions, and this approach has been imitated in other
work.58−60 Finally, our group demonstrated that protonated diamines,
even as zwitterions, exhibit selective interaction with dianions,61 and this can be exploited as another separation
development tool.47,62 Consequently, the combination
of a pyridine carboxylic acid, diamine-containing base, and zwitterionic
surfactant at a pH near 4 were chosen for shaping the desired separation.

Ions relevant for the current separation include chloride, sulfate,
nitrate, nitrite, chlorate, fluoride, and formate. Of these, only
nitrite, fluoride, and formate are significantly affected by pH in
the pH-4 regime. Organic ions with high electrophoretic mobility at
this pH were also considered, specifically oxalate, malonate, tartrate,
fumarate, and pyruvate. Although phosphate is often present, its expected
migration time is much later than that of selenite at the BGE pH according
to PeakMaster simulations.57 The mobility
of all the weak acids can be modified easily via pH. Similarly, ionic
strength allows altering relative mobilities of mono- and dianions,
although its range is limited (∼1–10 mM) by buffering
and stacking considerations on the low end and background conductivity
on the high end of concentration ranges. Methodical studies on pH
and ionic strength were not performed because their effects are predictable
with PeakMaster simulations.57 Instead,
these variables were used as tweaks to the separation after optimizing
the zwitterionic surfactant and diamine complexation.

The purpose
of the zwitterionic surfactant is to alter the mobility
of weakly solvated anions through interaction with surfactant micelles.
The surfactant also stabilizes the EOF. On the basis of previous work,47 TDAPS was chosen due to its purity, selectivity,
and low critical micelle concentration. A TDAPS concentration study
was performed at a calculated ionic strength of 5.0 mM and pH 4.00
(measured = 3.95). Figure 2a shows the resulting
electrophoretic mobilities. In addition to the previously mentioned
ions, the following potential internal standards were evaluated: EDS,
1,3-propanedisulfonate (PDS), sulfamate, methanesulfonate, and TFA.
Interaction strength with the TDAPS micelles qualitatively agreed
with the reported trends of weakly solvated anions partitioning more
favorably, showing selectivity that follows the Hofmeister series.63 Nitrate, chlorate, and TFA exhibited the strongest
interactions with TDAPS, and respective association constants were
measured at 5.2, 12.8, and 14.4 M–1 (all measured
affinity constants are provided in Table S-1, Supporting Information).

TDAPS and (bottom) HEPBS. Solid lines are for analyte species, and
dotted lines are for potential internal standards.

The BGE diamine is added to achieve control over
the mobility of
the dianionic analytes (sulfate and selenate). It also acts as a buffering
base/cation. Although most protonated diamines are capable of altering
dianion mobility,61 to keep conductivity
low, reduce ion-depletion effects, and increase buffer capacity, zwitterionic
diamines with pKa values near the operating
pH are preferable. Previously, we found HEPBS to work well for these
purposes,47 so it was chosen. However,
in previous separations, the diamine was used as the sole base because
the desired complexation, pH, and ionic strength were conveniently
achieved with a single base.47,62 Because of the proximity
of selenate and sulfate in this work, another base was needed because
ionic strength and protonated diamine concentration needed to be varied
independently. Ionic strength affects all dianions uniformly, whereas
diamine concentration imparts some selectivity. Therefore, nicotinamide
was chosen as the second BGE base due to its high commercial purity,
solubility, pKa, and moderately low molar
conductivity. A quantitative study on electrophoretic mobility as
a function of HEPBS concentration was performed using nicotinamide
as a cobase at a calculated ionic strength of 7.5 mM and pH 4.00 (measured
= 3.98). Results are shown in Figure 2b. The
expected trends of complexation with sulfate/selenate and no significant
interaction with the monoanions were observed. The precision of the
data is lower than in the TDAPS study, possibly due to increased and
variable joule heating at the higher ionic strength and differing
conductivities of the BGEs. This leads to artifacts such as slight
increases in the observed mobilities of some monoanions. The data
quality precluded evaluating affinity constants for the weaker interactions,
but sulfate and selenate were measured at 34.4 and 23.8 M–1, respectively. The relative strengths of these two interactions
qualitatively agree with previous studies,61 and their magnitudes are 2–2.5× higher, which is expected
for the lower ionic strength used here (7.5 vs 30 mM). Somewhat surprisingly,
little complexation was observed for the dianionic EDS and PDS. This
low affinity was not explored but may be due to the separation of
the charged moieties in these species. The HEPBS results indicate
that sulfate/selenate resolution decreases with added HEPBS, so the
only benefit of including HEPBS is to increase resolution with chloride.
Optimized conditions require balancing sulfate/selenate resolution
with avoiding an overloaded chloride peak present in some samples.

Combining the results from Figure 2 with
well-known pH and ionic strength effects allowed us to develop three
optimized conditions, and example separations with 10 μM analytes
are shown in Figure 3. The top trace was performed
with BGE 1, which consists of 42 mM nicotinic acid, 15 mM nicotinamide,
2.6 mM HEPBS, and 18 mM TDAPS. Calculated ionic strength, pH, and
conductivity are 6.4 mM, 3.95, and 414 μS cm–1, respectively. These conditions are favored for being highly selective.
Drawbacks of this BGE include fluoride/methanesulfonate comigration
and long formate migration times (electropherograms in Figure S3, Supporting Information). Also, the nitrite peak
is less intense than expected for conductivity detection. Inspection
of the nitrite peak reveals tailing. Because nitrite peak shape and
intensity improve at higher pH, we concluded that the protonated fraction
undergoes significant interaction with the PDMS substrate. To improve
nitrite sensitivity, resolve fluoride, and speed up formate, a higher
pH can be used, although this decreases selectivity against organic
interferents. BGE 2, the second trace of Figure 3, utilizes a higher pH. Its composition is 25 mM nicotinic acid,
36 mM nicotinamide, 3.8 mM HEPBS, and 18 mM TDAPS, yielding a calculated
6.4 mM ionic strength, 395 μS cm–1 conductivity,
and pH 4.22. A modest increase in nitrite sensitivity and resolution
of both fluoride and formate are obtained. The higher mobility of
nitrite also improves PDS as an internal standard because nitrite’s
reduced tailing causes less interference. As already mentioned, the
main drawback of increasing pH is the greater susceptibility to interfering
organic compounds. The final trace in Figure 3 shows BGE 3, which is composed of 12 mM nicotinic acid, 14 mM nicotinamide,
4 mM HEPBS, and 12 mM TDAPS. The calculated ionic strength, pH, and
conductivity are 3.1 mM, 4.30, and 200 μS cm–1, respectively. The main differences in BGE 2 and BGE 3 are ionic
strength and conductivity. BGE 3 has approximately half the ionic
strength and conductivity. This leads to a decrease in resolution
between chloride and both sulfate and selenate, making it less suitable
for high-chloride matrices. However, the advantage of BGE 3 is its
improved conductivity detection. With the detector used here, the
lower background conductivity reduced the digital step size, doubling
signal-to-noise ratio. Overall, the choice of BGE is application-dependent,
but BGE 1 is recommended for most applications.

Method Figures of Merit
Method detection limits are
of primary importance in selenium assays because of the low concentrations.
In electrophoresis with electrokinetic injection, the injected quantity
depends on the sample conductivity because of field-amplified stacking
effects, with the injected amount being roughly proportional to the
BGE/sample conductivity ratio. For this work, the detection limits
(and linear ranges) were measured using BGE 1 for samples prepared
in BGE to eliminate stacking effects. Limits of detection were 53
nM (4.2 ppb Se) for selenate and 380 (30 ppb Se) for selenite. For
the other analytes in the top trace of Figure 3, limits of detection were 140–240 nM except for chloride
(1.9 μM) and nitrite (610 nM). A table of the determined detection
limits for all species is provided in Table S-2 (Supporting Information). Detection limits are dictated by
the instrument digital–analog conversion except for chloride,
sulfate, nitrate, and methanesulfonate, which had significant blanks
that were measurable above the baseline, and were therefore measured
as 3σ of blanks. Overall, the selenium detection limits are
better than those reported for CE with nonspecific detectors, such
as indirect UV, indirect fluorescent, and contactless conductivity
detection,18,19,40 but cannot compete with the more expensive ICP and MS detectors.

To test linear ranges, 10 μM EDS was used as an internal
standard and the peak area ratio was measured for eight concentrations
from ∼1–1000 μM. Linearity below 1 μM was
not specifically evaluated, but response was observed to be linear
to the LOD in the detection limit study, where multiple concentrations
were analyzed below 1 μM. Linearity for chloride, nitrate, and
sulfamate was only tested to 500 μM because these three species
were analyzed together and nitrate/EDS resolution was incomplete at
1000 μM. All species maintained linearity for the entire tested
range except selenite, which showed reduced sensitivity at 1000 μM.
It is unknown why there was a reduction in sensitivity for only selenite
above 500 μM, but it may stem from the injection, as selenite
reaches the injector later than the other species. Regardless, linearity
to only 500 μM is unlikely problematic for selenite since few
samples present selenite this high and those that do can be diluted.
Correlation coefficients for the linear fits were >0.9999 except
for
chloride (0.9998), selenite (0.9990), and nitrite (0.9985). The lower
precision for these three species was attributed, respectively, to
ubiquity (more variable blanks), a broader peak (variable integration
width), and peak tailing.

Performance in Realistic Matrices
The most prevalent
ions in most matrices, particularly biological ones, are sodium and
chloride. They interfere with analysis by increasing matrix conductivity,
and high chloride manifests as an overloaded peak that can overwhelm
smaller peaks. To test robustness against chloride interference, the
separation of 10 μM species in BGE 1 was performed with 11 NaCl
concentrations ranging from 0 to 3 mM (Figure 4). Sulfate remains resolved to 0.5 mM chloride, selenate is resolved
through 1.5 mM, and nitrate stays resolved to 3.0 mM. The slower peaks
are practically unaffected by these levels of chloride, as expected.
The most significant problem from high chloride is the large baseline
perturbation, particularly for concentrations >1 mM. We suspect
this
problem is due to small levels of contaminant chloride (and possibly
sulfate) present in the BGE constituents rather than a fundamental
issue with the BGE or detector, as a small baseline perturbation is
present even in the absence of sample chloride. Despite the perturbation,
the durability of the separation against chloride is sufficient for
many matrix types, although most biological samples will need dilution
prior to analysis.

Figure 4 Effect of chloride on BGE 1 separation. Peaks are the
first ten
identified in Figure 3. Chloride concentrations
(mM, from bottom): 0.00, 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0,
2.5, and 3.0. Other species were 10 μM.

Because of the relatively slow migration of biselenite, it
is prone
to interference from weak acids. Therefore, BGE 1 was tested for interference
from fluoride, formate, oxalate, malonate, tartrate, fumarate, and
pyruvate (see Figure S-3, Supporting Information). As already mentioned, fluoride comigrates with methanesulfonate,
and formate is significantly slower than selenite (by ∼30 s).
Oxalate did not give a peak, and malonate exhibited a broad, tailing
peak beginning ∼10 s after selenite. The poor behavior of these
ions is attributed to their ligand qualities leading to them adsorbing
to bound metals on the capillary surface. This behavior has been observed
for polyvalent anions on fused silica,64 and we previously observed reduced oxalate sensitivity with PDMS
devices and remedied it using a metal-binding BGE.47 Fumarate and tartrate comigrate with formate. Pyruvate
appears as a tailing peak ∼10 s before selenite, but does not
interfere significantly. These anions are the most common interferents,
but other organics could pose an issue for specific applications and
would need to be tested.

In addition to ionic species, nonionic
species could potentially
interfere with quantification. To test the resilience of BGE 1 to
a realistic matrix, six artificial samples containing known amounts
of selenate, selenite, nitrate, and chlorate were prepared in 0.5%
BBL broth and analyzed with both MCE and IC. The final matrix contained
∼430 μM chloride, ∼72 μM phosphate, and
a range of biomolecules including sugars and protein fragments. Results
are shown in Table 1, and representative separations
are given in Figures S-4 and S-5 (Supporting Information). Our MCE method correctly quantified 23 of 24 measurements, with
one nitrate value differing at the 95% confidence interval (but falling
within the 99% interval). The IC method agreed with the expected values
for all selenate, nitrate, and chlorate measurements, but all the
nonzero selenite samples were outside the 95% confidence interval.
The reason was selenite’s placement in the IC separation, shortly
after a tailing phosphate peak. Phosphate’s tail altered the
integration of selenite, making it significantly different from the
calibration. However, the IC’s failure to properly analyze
selenite here is due to the employed method and not an inherent shortcoming
of IC. To properly compare MCE and IC, the average error for the other
species was considered, excluding values below the LOD. For this data
subset (n = 15), MCE averaged 2.3 μM and 3.2%
error; IC averaged 2.6 μM and 4.2% error. The slightly superior
MCE results are also evident from their smaller confidence intervals,
in part a consequence of the additional calibration degree of freedom.

The BGE 1 method was further evaluated by monitoring anion consumption
by a strain of pseudomonas bacteria
cultured in LB broth spiked with nitrate (21.3 mM) and selenite (12.7
mM). After the 250× dilution, nitrate was 85 μM, selenite
was initially at 51 μM, and the matrix contained ∼680
μM chloride. Electropherograms and analyte concentrations as
a function of incubation time are shown in Figure 5. The separation maintained integrity despite the complex
matrix, and no significant peaks were observed after selenite (LB
broth does not contain phosphate). The bacteria’s preference
for selenite over nitrate is apparent, with the concentration of nitrate
not changing significantly while the concentration of selenite decreased
until it was below the detection limit after 48 h of incubation. Overall,
this application shows the utility of this technique for measuring
selenium oxoanions in realistic biological matrices.

Limitations and Avenues
for Improvement
Although the
demonstrated method is durable and highly quantitative, it has several
shortcomings. The primary restraint is the moderate resolution between
selenate and sulfate (∼1.8 for 10 μM ions). For biological
matrices, this may not be an issue, but many high-selenium matrices
also have high levels of sulfate. Although HEPBS improves resolution
from chloride, it lowers sulfate/selenate resolution due to its higher
sulfate affinity (14.8 vs 9.3 M–1),61 limiting the amount of complexation that can be employed.
Ideally, a diamine with preference for selenate is preferable; unfortunately,
there are currently no known diamines with this selectivity.61 The best available option would be to use bis-tris
propane because of its similar affinities for sulfate and selenate
(17.2 and 15.0 M–1, respectively),61 so little resolution would be lost. However, background
conductivity and ion depletion rate would increase with bis-tris propane,
whereas buffering capacity would decrease.

Another limitation
of the separation is the baseline perturbation near the chloride peak.
This is attributed to low-level impurities (chloride and/or sulfate)
present in the employed buffers. The impurities act as BGE co-ions,
and multiple co-ions induce system zone(s) in the separation. The
relatively low impurity concentration results in the system zone being
located near the mobility of the impurity ion.65 These impurities also lead to high blank values for chloride
and sulfate, raising their detection limits. Purifying these buffers
or replacing them with higher purity ones would improve performance.
With better buffer purity, higher ionic strengths could also be employed
for resolution from chloride instead of using a diamine, increasing
sulfate/selenate resolution. That approach would be limited by increasing
BGE conductivity, which lowers conductivity detection performance
and increases resistive heating effects.

The final major drawback
of this method is its concentration sensitivity.
Although the low-ppb detection limits compare well with other electrophoretic
selenium separations with nonselective detectors, they are insufficient
for measuring trace species in high-chloride matrices. This limits
the application space of the separation to those with only low-millimolar
chloride content, with selenium concentrations high enough to undergo
significant dilution, or to applications amendable to extraction/preconcentration
procedures (which are frequently used for selenium monitoring).9 One way to curb this limitation is to develop
an optimized conductivity detector for MCE. The current detector is
limited by a digital–analog conversion. One future research
goal in our lab is to design a specialized contact conductivity detector
for MCE. With an optimized detector, mass detection limits would decrease,
permitting smaller injections and therefore less overloaded chloride
peaks.

Conclusions
We demonstrated an MCE
approach for the selective and sensitive
monitoring of selenium oxoanions and other inorganic anions using
contact conductivity detection. The ppb-level detection limits are
adequate for many applications, the method can tolerate chloride concentrations
up to ∼1.5 mM before losing selenate resolution, and interference
from common organic acids is avoided. The durability of the separation
was confirmed using samples in dilute biological media, where analysis
quality was maintained. However, the combination of sensitivity and
resilience to salinity is not high enough to perform trace analysis
in biological matrices without an extraction/preconcentration step.
The major method limitations and some options for improvement were
discussed. Overall, the method provides an inexpensive and fast option
to traditional selenium monitoring approaches for many applications.
