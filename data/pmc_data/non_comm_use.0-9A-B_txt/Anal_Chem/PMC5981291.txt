The application of
surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) for
everyday quantitative analysis is hindered by the point-to-point variability
of SERS substrates that arises due to the heterogeneous distribution
of localized electromagnetic fields across a suite of plasmonic nanostructures.
Herein, we adopt surface-enhanced elastic scattering as a SERS internal
standard. Both elastic and inelastic (i.e., Raman) scattering are
simultaneously enhanced by a given “hot spot”, and thus,
the surface-enhanced elastic scattering signal provides a localized
intrinsic internal standard that scales across all of the plasmon-enhanced
electromagnetic fields within a substrate. Elastically scattered light
originates from the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) of the commercial
laser, leading to the formation of a low-wavenumber pseudo band that
arises from the interaction of the ASE and the edge filter. A theoretical
model was developed to illustrate the underlying mechanism supporting
this normalization approach. The normalized Raman signals are independent
of the incident laser intensity and the density of “hot spots”
for numerous SERS substrates. Following “hot-spot” (HS)
normalization, the coefficient of variation for the tested SERS substrates
decreases from 10 to 60% to 2%–7%. This approach significantly
improves SERS quantitation of four chloroanilines and enables collection
of highly reproducible analyte adsorption results under both static
and dynamic imaging conditions. Overall, this approach provides a
simple means to improve SERS reproducibility without the need to use
additional chemicals as internal standards.

==== Body
Surface-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy
(SERS) has long been proposed as an ultrasensitive analysis method
with single molecule sensitivity, minimal need for sample pretreatment,
rapid detection time, and potential for on-site deployment.1−5 However, in spite of the volume of research conducted to develop
SERS substrates and optimize the technique, the poor reproducibility
of the SERS signal makes it a challenge to achieve reliable quantitative
analysis. SERS largely remains a laboratory curiosity, but with great
potential for multiple real-world applications.6−9 One means to improve SERS reproducibility
is to develop uniform SERS substrates through “top-down”
nanofabrication.10−15 However, it is challenging to create such substrates at scale and
at reasonable cost.

An alternative approach to improve SERS
reproducibility is to incorporate
internal standards (IS) into the substrate.16−19 The IS undergoes the same enhancement
as target analytes, thus reducing point-to-point variability in the
signal caused by substrate heterogeneity, laser intensity fluctuations,
or temperature variation. Although SERS quantitation can be achieved
using an IS, it adds to the cost and complexity of substrate preparation,
lacks universal applicability, generates interferent Raman bands,
and the reference probe molecules may occupy SERS “hot spots”.
In addition, it is nontrivial to find an appropriate IS that reflects
the chemical and physical properties of the target analyte. Isotope-edited
internal standards (IEIS) are ideal candidates for IS because the
isotope analogues have the same Raman cross-section and the same affinity
to the plasmonic surface.19,20 While analyte concentrations
can be determined based on the ratios of the Raman band intensities
of the two isotope analogues, their adsorption kinetics cannot be
acquired. In addition, IEIS for a large number of chemicals of analytical
interest are not readily available. Importantly, none of the aforementioned
approaches is applicable for SERS sensing under dynamic conditions
wherein “hot spot” densities change over time. Such
conditions are prevalent in SERS assays for biomedical and environmental
detection.21−25

The SERS effect is inherently surface enabled with the highest
signal enhancements observed at locations where the electromagnetic
field is highest (i.e., either at edges or between two nanoparticles).9,26 Regions with the highest enhancement factors are typically referred
to as SERS “hot spots”. Variation of SERS signals induced
by the heterogeneous distribution of “hot spots” oftentimes
surpasses that induced by the change of analyte concentrations on
NP surfaces. Therefore, normalizing “hot spot” distribution
across a single substrate or among different substrates is vitally
important for improving the performance of SERS quantitation. It was
recently reported that the elastic scattering undergoes the same electromagnetic
enhancement as the inelastic scattering coming from the same SERS
“hot spot”.27 Based on this
study and considering the intrinsic drawbacks of the reported IS,
we sought to explore the relationship between the measured elastic
scattering signal and the SERS signal intensity.

In this effort,
we demonstrate a simple approach for improving
SERS reproducibility that exploits surface plasmon enhanced elastic
scattering signals as internal standards for SERS signal normalization.
Both theory and experiments show that the intensity of the surface
plasmon enhanced elastic scattering signal of a low-wavenumber pseudoband
(νe) scales linearly with the integrated “hot-spot”
signal strength. This pseudoband can be used to calibrate “hot
spot” variations and minimize the signal heterogeneity of a
SERS substrate, account for batch-to-batch substrate variability and
different types of SERS substrates. We first discuss the fundamental
theory supporting our approach, provide supporting experimental results,
and conclude by demonstrating “hot spot” normalization
for (1) quantitative pH-triggered SERS detection of chloroanilines
and (2) differentiation of analyte adsorption and “hot spot”
formation in a dynamic colloidal system.

Experimental Section
Materials
Gold(III) chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O), sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate
(Na3Cit·2H2O), silver nitrate (AgNO3), 4-chloroaniline (4-CA, 98%), 3-chloroaniline (3-CA, 99%),
2-chloroaniline (2-CA, 98%), 2,4-dichloroaniline (99%), 3-bromoaniline
(3-BA), 3-nitroaniline (3-NA), melamine, and 4-mercaptobenzoic acid
(4-MBA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4), hydrochloride acid (HCl), and ethanol were purchased from
Fisher Scientific. Malachite green isothiocyanate (MGITC) was acquired
from Invitrogen Corp. (Grand Island, NY). Thiolated poly(ethylene
glycol) (HS-PEG; 5 kDa) was purchased from Nanocs.

Transmission
Measurement
SERS spectra of DI water were
collected using a transmission mode Raman system equipped with an
inverted microscope (WITec alpha 300 RSA+). Two identical objectives
were used (20×, NA = 0.4) to focus into the sample with a spot
size of ≈2.4 μm and collect the signal through the sample.
The laser excitation wavelength was 785 nm. We employed a long-pass
filter (cutoff wavelength: 68 cm–1) before the detector
to generate pseudoband νe, and a bandpass filter
(center wavelength: 785 nm, Full Width-Half Max: 3 nm) was placed
to block the elastic scattering process of ASE fields from the laser.
Before the laser and detector, there were two small confocal pinhole
apertures that increase optical resolution and suppress out-of-focus
light.

Backscattering Measurement
All SERS spectra except
the laser emission profile shown in Figure 1c were acquired using a confocal Raman spectroscopy
system in backscattering mode (WITec alpha 500R). SERS maps were generally
collected with a 10× objective. Each SERS map consists of 20
× 20 spectra across a 100 × 100 μm2 area.
The laser wavelength was 785 nm and integration time was 0.5 s. The
Raman signal was dispersed by a 300 gr/mm grating and detected using
a Peltier charge-coupled device. To make HS normalized maps, spectra
from a SERS map were imported into Matlab 2015 (The Mathworks, U.S.A.)
and baseline corrected using in-house scripts. For the maps using
PL as normalizing factor, only the dark background (Figure 1e) was subtracted. As shown
in Figure S1, the Au–Cl Raman band
at 267 cm–1 does not influence νe even when an edge filter cutting at 126 cm–1 was
employed. Integrated intensities from 106 to 146 cm–1 for νe at 126 cm–1 or 64–104
cm–1 for νe at 84 cm–1 were employed as the normalizing factor. The ratio of the analyte
band to νe was projected as a normalized SERS map
using Matlab.

Preparation of SERS Substrates
Preparation and characterization
of the AuNP/BC platform was described previously.7 Briefly, 16 pieces of BC (0.5 cm × 0.5 cm) were immersed
in 0.7 mL HAuCl4 solution (30 mM) for 30 s and then transferred
to 50 mL boiling Na3Cit solution (1.2 mM unless otherwise
denoted) for 1.5 h. Scanning electron microscopy images, energy dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy, and UV–vis extinction spectra are shown
in Figures S2 and S3 and in our previous
publication.7 AgNP/BC was prepared by adding
0.7 mL of NaBH4 (25 mM unless otherwise denoted) into a
tube containing 0.7 mL of AgNO3 (25 mM) and 20 pieces of
BC followed by vortex mixing. The preparation method for 14 nm AuNP
seeds and 50 nm AuNPs is described in Supporting Information Note S1. Briefly, AuNP seeds were synthesized by
adding Na3Cit solution (final concn: 3.88 mM) to boiling
HAuCl4 solution (final concn: 1 mM) for 15 min. AuNPs (50
nm) were synthesized by seed-mediated growth. A 100 mL HAuCl4 solution (final concn: 0.254 mM) was brought to boil, to which 0.818
mL of seed solution and 0.44 mL of citrate (38.8 mM) were subsequently
added. 4-MBA coated AuNP aggregate suspension was prepared by ethanol-induced
aggregation followed by thiolated poly(ethylene) glycol (HS-PEG) functionalization.28

Manipulation of Hot Spot Density in AuNP/BC
Substrate
One piece of AuNP/BC (0.5 × 0.5 cm2) hydrogel was
immersed in 5 mL of 4-MBA ethanol solution (1 mM) for 3 h. The 4-MBA
concentration used here was high enough to ensure that a complete
monolayer formed on the nanoparticle surface. SERS maps were collected
from the wet AuNP/BC hydrogel in air every 20 min until 60 min. After
the AuNP/BC was completely dry, SERS maps were collected using both
10× and 100× objectives.

pH-Triggered Detection
of Four Chloroanilines
Sample
aliquots of 1 mL of 4-CA, 3-CA, 2-CA, or 2,4-DCA in ethanol solutions
with a concentration of 1 mM were added to 3 mL aqueous solution with
pH preadjusted to values below their pKa. The final ethanol concentration (25%) had minimal influence on
SERS detection (data not shown). One piece of AuNP/BC (0.5 ×
0.5 cm2) hydrogel was immersed in chloroaniline solution.
After vortex mixing for 30 s, the AuNP/BC hydrogel was taken out for
SERS measurement.

Quantitation of Chloroanilines
To
determine the dynamic
range of four chloroanilines, 1 mL 4-CA, 3-CA, 2-CA, and 2,4-DCA in
ethanol with concentrations from 1 to 1000 μM was added to a
3 mL aqueous solution with pH preadjusted to 1.7–2.3. One piece
of AuNP/BC (0.5 × 0.5 cm2) hydrogel was immersed in
the chloroaniline solution. After vortex mixing for 30 s, the AuNP/BC
hydrogel was taken out for Raman measurement.

SERS Spectra Collection
with a Variety of Analytes and Substrates
SERS spectra of
a variety of analytes were acquired using an AuNP/BC
platform via a pH-triggered approach.7 In
this process, 1 mL of analyte in ethanol (1 mM) was added to a 3 mL
aqueous solution of preadjusted pH to ensure that solution pH values
were below the analyte pKa. The final
pH values were: MGITC: 5.4; 4-CA: 2.3; 3-CA: 1.9; 2-CA: 1.9; 2,4-DCA:
1.7; Melamine: 2.3; 3-BA: 2.3; and 3-NA: 1.8. One piece of AuNP/BC
(0.5 × 0.5 cm2) hydrogel was immersed in each solution.
After vortex mixing for 30 s, the AuNP/BC hydrogel was taken out for
Raman measurement. SERS spectra of blank AuNP/BC were collected at
pH values of 5.4 and 2.3 as negative controls.

Monitoring 4-MBA Adsorption
to Stable and Dynamic SERS Substrates
A piece of AuNP/BC
was attached to the bottom of a small Petri
dish. After collecting the first SERS map (blank), 6 mL of 4-MBA ethanol/water
solution (50 μM) was added. SERS spectra were collected every
1 min for the first five spectra, every 5 min for the next five spectra,
every 10 min for the next five spectra, and every 20 min for the remaining
four spectra. To monitor 4-MBA adsorption to aggregating AuNP surface,
0.5 mL of 4-MBA ethanol solution (100 μM) was added into 0.5
mL of AuNP suspension. After the mixture was mixed by vortexing, it
was transferred to a quartz cell and scanned. SERS maps (20 ×
20 points, 1000 × 1000 μm2, 0.5 s int. time)
were collected every 5 min until 180 min. Before calculating the ratio
between the Raman and elastic bands, the blank spectrum was subtracted
from each SERS spectrum to exclude the influence of ASE photons scattered
by water.

Results and Discussion
Theoretical Basis for “Hot
Spot” Normalization
Using a scalar phenomenological
theory,29,30 we developed an analytical expression that
predicts that the intensity
of the surface-enhanced elastic scattering signal is proportional
to the SERS signal from the ensemble of analyte and background molecules
in the vicinity of plasmonic nanostructures. We propose that the surface-enhanced
elastic scattering signal can serve as an intrinsic internal standard
for quantitative SERS under carefully controlled conditions.

As depicted in Figure 1a, a molecule is located at position r0 close to a plasmonic
metal nanostructure (at r′) that supports localized surface
plasmon resonances (LSPRs) and converts the incident fields E0(r0, ω0) into local scattered
fields ER(r0, ω0) ∼ f(r0, ω0)E0(r0, ω0), where f(r0, ω0) is the field enhancement factor. Laser illumination
gives rise not only to the stimulated emission fields E0(r0, ω0) at the lasing frequency ω0, but also amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) fields E0(r0, ω1) over broad frequencies
ω1 that have weaker amplitudes than the lasing emission.
An analyte molecule at r0 experiences the total local fields
E0 + Es ∼ (1+ f(r0, ω))*E0(r0, ω) at lasing
frequency ω0 and ASE frequencies ω1, respectively. The interaction of the molecule with the enhanced
total local fields at ω0 gives rise to the dipole
moment associated with inelastic Raman scattering according to p(ω0 ± ωvib, ω0) = α(ω0 ±
ωvib, ω0)[1 + f(r0, ω0)]E0(r0, ω0), where ωvib is a vibrationally shifted frequency and α(ω0 ± ωvib, ω0) is the
polarizability for the frequency mixing Stokes (ω0 - ωvib) or anti-Stokes (ω0 + ωvib) Raman scattering process. Similarly, the dipole moment
associated with elastic scattering at frequency ω1 can be induced according to p(ω1) = α(ω1)[1 + f(r0, ω1)]E0(r0, ω1), where α(ω1) is the
polarizability of the elastic scattering process. In the presence
of plasmonic nanostructures, the Green function G(r∞, r0, ω) of the combined molecule-nanostructure
system is represented as (1+f(r0, ω)) G0(r∞, r0, ω),
where G0 is the free-space Green function
in the absence of plasmonic nanostructures and f is
the field enhancement factor at the radiation frequency. The electric
field intensity IRaman of the radiation from the induced Raman scattering dipole p(ω0 ± ωvib, ω0) depends on the incident field intensity I0 and can be expressed as 1  Similarly, the radiation intensity IElastic from the induced elastic scattering
dipole p(ω1) is 2  

For most quantitative SERS applications, we want to quantify
analyte
molecule concentrations by measuring Raman signals from an ensemble
of analyte molecules in a dielectric environment (e.g., various liquids).
Under laser illumination both the inelastic Raman scattering and the
elastic scattering signals come from an ensemble of analyte and background
molecules. According to eq 1 and eq 2, the
ratio of signal intensities between Raman scattering at ω0 ± ωvib and elastic scattering at ω1 can be expressed as 3  where NA, NB are the molar concentrations of the analyte
and the background solvent molecules (NB ≫ NA) present within the sampling
volume V, αA(ω0 ± ωvib, ω0) is the Raman
scattering polarizability of the analyte molecules, αB(ω1) is the elastic scattering polarizability of
the background molecules, and r0i, r0j are the positions of
analyte molecule i and background molecule j.

If we constrain the optical sampling volume within
a tightly focused
spot that contains plasmonic nanostructures (e.g., by use of a confocal
configuration), both the surface-enhanced elastic scattering and the
inelastic scattering signals will be dominated by the analyte and
background molecules located in close proximity to “hot spots”
that induce the maximum intensities of both elastic and inelastic
scattering proportional to |fmax|,4 where fmax is the
maximum field enhancement factor in the hot spot region at the excitation
frequency ω0.27 Because
ω0 ≅ ω1 ≫ ωvib, we assume fmax(r0, ω0) ≅ fmax(r0, ω1) ≅ fmax(r0, ω0 ± ωvib)
≡ fmax ≫ 1, and G0(r∞, r0, ω1) ≅ G0(r∞, r0, ω0 ± ωvib). In this case, the ratio of Raman and elastic signal intensities
can be approximated as 4  

During a SERS measurement, all factors
(e.g., NB, αA, αB, and I0(r0, ω0)/I0(r0, ω1)) except NA in eq 4 are constant. By normalizing
the SERS signals with the surface-enhanced elastic scattering signals
of the background molecules in the “hot spots”, the
new ratiometric signal, , provides quantitation
of the molar concentration
of analyte molecules NA without being
affected by the many experimental factors that give rise to uncontrollable
spatial and temporal perturbations (e.g., local refractive index environments,
local field enhancement factors, and local laser illumination fluxes).

We emphasize that the elastic scattering polarizability αB(ω1) is many orders larger
than the Raman scattering polarizability αA(ω0 ± ωvib, ω0) and that NB is generally orders
of magnitude higher than NA. Consequently,
to maintain a large signal-to-noise for quantitative SERS applications,
we must ensure that I0(r0, ω0) (=excitation field intensity for
Raman scattering) ≫ I0(r0, ω1) (=excitation field intensity
for elastic scattering) in eq 4. This condition can be satisfied by using intense lasing
light and weak ASE light in the laser emission.

Origin of νe
As a proof of concept,
we used a confocal Raman microspectroscopy/imaging setup (Figure 1b) to simultaneously
collect and compare inelastic Raman and elastic scattering signals
from a tightly focused spot on a nanostructured plasmonic substrate.
As shown in Figure 1c, the measured diode laser (785 nm) emission spectrum (red curve)
consists of a narrow laser line at 0 cm–1 along
with a broad ASE background that extends beyond 200 cm–1. After blocking the laser emission with a long-pass (edge) filter,
we observe an asymmetric peak (νe) at 76 cm–1 that is an artificial/pseudo spectral feature due to the convolution
of the spectral profile of the ASE and the transmittance of the filter
(cut-on wavenumber: 68 cm–1). By choosing long-pass
filters with different cut-on wavenumbers and cutoff slopes, we can
control the spectral position, shape, and amplitude of νe (Figure S4). For instance, when
we insert a bandpass filter in addition to the long-pass filter, the
pseudo peak (νe) at 76 cm–1 (green
curve) is significantly attenuated showing that νe originates from the laser ASE.

Because νe is weak, it has been typically overlooked based on the assumption
that elastic scattering will be fully blocked by the long-pass filter.31,32 This assumption deviates from the reality of many SERS studies.
We speculated that the weak νe interacts with SERS
“hot spots”, is elastically scattered by the molecules
within them and experiences the same electromagnetic enhancement as
Raman scattering.27 To test this hypothesis,
backscattered Raman spectra of a Si wafer and a SERS substrate, that
is, gold nanoparticle/bacterial cellulose (AuNP/BC), were collected.
As shown in Figure 1d, an asymmetric peak at 76 cm–1 appears in the
Raman spectra for both Si and the SERS substrate that reflects the
line shape of the laser ASE (red curve). Notably, the νe of AuNP/BC was 2600× larger than that of the Si wafer,
thus supporting the hypothesis that νe is significantly
enhanced by SERS “hot spots” (Figure 1d).

As shown in Figure S5 and Note S2, additional
experiments using a second Raman instrument equipped with an edge
filter (cut-on wavenumber: 126 cm–1) to probe AuNP/BC,
a commercial SERS substrate, and aggregated AuNP colloids corroborate
this result. AuNP monomer colloid exhibited an extremely weak νe, which was almost identical to that of DI water. νe was significantly enhanced following the addition of phosphate
buffer to the colloid, concomitant to hot spot formation (Figure S5). The intensities of νe (IElastic(r∞, ω1)) of AuNP/BC (high hot spot density), AuNP
cluster colloid (low hot spot density), AuNP monomer colloid (no hot
spots), and DI water (no hot spots) followed the trend: DI ≈
AuNP monomer < AuNP cluster < AuNP/BC at any given incident
laser power (Figure S6). Across all experiments,
νe is characteristically weak in the absence of large
numbers of SERS hotspots. Therefore, we neglected the contribution
of molecules and nanoparticles located outside hot spots to νe in the following discussion.

We emphasize that νe occurs in addition to the
SERS background continuum that originates from the combination of
the photoluminescence (PL) of the plasmonic nanostructures and the
fluorescence emitted by fluorophores near the surface under laser
excitation.33−36 Fluorophores in resonance with the excitation laser are subject
to surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEF) that contributes to the background
continuum.35,37,38 To minimize this possibility, we primarily used a nonresonant molecule,
4-MBA, and thoroughly washed our substrates such that residual fluorophores
were removed. PL originates from the radiative recombination of sp
band electrons and excited d band holes in noble metals and can be
significantly enhanced by the surface plasmon resonance of nanostructures.32,36,39 PL is an inherent characteristic
of the SERS spectrum and is typically the primary contributor to the
SERS continuum. Many SERS studies report spectra in a range far away
from the excitation wavelength (>200 cm–1)37,40,41 where the PL signal can dominate
the SERS continuum. It should be noted, however, that for any given
SERS substrate the contribution of PL to the SERS continuum will be
a function of the laser excitation wavelength.32,40 To illustrate, the AuNP/BC substrate was probed using both 633 and
785 nm excitation. As shown in Figure 1e, the PL background of the SERS spectrum obtained
with the 633 nm laser perfectly predicts the PL background of the
SERS spectrum collected under 785 nm excitation. The contribution
of PL to the pseudopeak at 84 cm–1 (the red-shaded
areas) is a function of the laser excitation, with a larger contribution
under 633 nm excitation (∼50.1%) than at 785 nm (∼6.5%). Figure 1e illustrates the
additive contribution of surface-enhanced elastic scattering to νe relative to the broad, smooth PL background.36 The influence of PL on the intensity of νe is readily accounted for by baseline correction using published
Matlab scripts (Figure S7).42

The strong correlation between PL and
the dark-field scattering
spectra of individual plasmonic nanoparticles/clusters demonstrates
that the PL spectrum is dependent on the localized surface plasmon
resonance (LSPR) of the nanostructures.32,34,36,43,44 This LSPR dependence was experimentally demonstrated by the dissimilar
SERS backgrounds of two SERS substrates, AgNP/BC and AuNP/BC, for
wavenumbers >188 cm–1 where the laser ASE is
quite
weak (Figure 1d, Figure S8). The νe line shapes
for these substrates overlap and resemble the line shape of the laser
ASE < 188 cm–1 (Figure 1d), further indicating that νe originates from ASE and not PL.

Figure 1f shows
the Raman spectra of 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) functionalized
AuNP clusters under various laser powers. The intensities of the laser
band (0 cm–1), the elastic pseudo peak (126 cm–1), and the most intense Raman bands (1076 and 1587
cm–1) are plotted in Figure 1g. Each of these bands increase linearly
with an increase in laser power. As expected based on our theoretical
analysis, the intensity trend for the pseudo elastic scattering peak
is similar to that of the Raman bands. The intensity of νe at 126 cm–1 is of comparable magnitude
to the Raman scatting intensity, which makes it a potentially suitable
internal standard for calibration of the SERS signals. To validate
this hypothesis the intensity ratios of the pseudo peak (126 cm–1) and two Raman bands (1076 and 1587 cm–1) are plotted in Figure 1h. These ratios are independent of laser intensity, a finding
in agreement with eq 4.

Reducing SERS Substrate Heterogeneity by HS Normalization
All other parameters being fixed, the ratio defined by eq 4 will be constant no matter
how “hot spot” density changes. To illustrate, we exploited
an AuNP/BC hydrogel7 that exhibits temporally
variable “hot spot” densities as a function of drying
time (Figure 2a). Over
a 1 h drying period, both the 4-MBA Raman band at 1076 cm–1 and νe increase in intensity due to the drying
mediated increase in “hot spot” density (Figure 2b,c). Despite these temporal
changes, however, the ratio between the Raman band and νe remained constant (Figure 2d), as expected.

randomly selected from a SERS map containing 400 pixels).

We suggest that the intensity of νe provides an
indication of the integrated strength of SERS efficiency from all
“hot spots” within the microscope collection volume.
One hundred spectra were randomly selected from a 400 pixel SERS map
of 4-MBA on AuNP/BC. Across this map, as shown in Figure 2e, the intensity of the 4-MBA
Raman band at 1076 cm–1 increased linearly with
the intensity of νe (R2 = 0.99). This linearity shows that νe quantitatively
reflects the integrated SERS efficiency of the excited “hot
spots”. We note that the intensity of the 4-MBA Raman band
correlates poorly with the intensity of the PL background (Figure 2f), thus indicating
that νe can serve as a SERS internal standard while
the SERS continuum cannot.

The measured SERS intensity of any
analyte reflects the combined
effects of laser intensity, the electromagnetic field within SERS
“hot spots”, “hot spot” density, and the
number of analyte molecules within the probe volume.45 As discussed previously, the fluctuations of the first
three factors are significantly reduced by νe normalization,
leaving the number of analyte molecules as the remaining variable
dictating signal intensity. Normalization by νe (= IRaman/IElastic)
decreases the variability of the SERS signal by minimizing point-to-point
variations in SERS “hot spot” densities. We refer to
this approach as “hot spot” (HS) normalization.

HS normalization significantly reduces the point-to-point heterogeneity
of SERS substrates. Using the AuNP/BC substrate and 4-MBA as our test
analyte, Raman maps (100 × 100 μm2; 400 pixels)
were constructed by separately tracking the Raman band at 1076 cm–1, νe at 84 cm–1, and background PL at 1820 cm–1 (Figure 3a–j). The maps tracking
the Raman band and νe exhibit highly similar “hot
spot” distributions illustrating that Raman scattering and
elastic scattering are similarly enhanced. The measured coefficients
of variation (CV), or the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean,
were 9.3 and 18.8% for the 10× and 100× objectives, respectively.
However, following HS normalization, the CVs declined to 2.3 and 7.9%,
respectively. After HS normalization, all the “hot spots”
and “cold spots” (i.e., spots with below average signal
intensity) disappear, graphically illustrating the concept of HS normalization.
Averaging SERS signals across a map can also reduce signal fluctuation.46 However, the “averaging” approach
sacrifices the spatial resolution of SERS, is time consuming, and
may not work well for substrates with low hot spot density.

respectively; Each substrate was scanned (containing 400 pixels) three
times, and the error bars reflect the standard deviation of these
three scans.

Recently, Ren et al.
retrieved the original relative intensity
among Raman bands by normalizing SERS spectra by the scattering spectra
of the same nanoparticles (or bulk material photoluminescence (PLbulk)-normalized SERS background).34 The aim of their study was to mitigate the plasmonic spectral shaping
effect caused by varying nanoparticle LSPRs, whereas our aim was to
reduce the SERS signal fluctuation caused by varying electromagnetic
enhancements. In addition, the approach proposed by Ren et al. was
more time-consuming because of the requirement for collecting PLbulk and the more complex data analysis. Maps normalized using
background PL exhibit little improvement in CV. The differential performance
of PL vs νe as a SERS internal standard is attributed
to their different enhancement mechanisms. PL reflects the enhancement
of a radiating dipole comprising d-bands and s-electrons in the presence
of a LSPR.47 In contrast, νe is enhanced by the same electromagnetic mechanism responsible for
SERS.27 No correlation was observed between
the elastic band at laser excitation wavenumber (0 cm–1) and Raman band, which was consistent with the literature.48 The mechanism for the distinct behaviors of
laser band at 0 cm–1 and νe is
our research interest in the future. The concept of HS normalization
is extendable to other 4-MBA Raman bands as well as AuNP suspension-based
SERS (Figures S9–11). It is notable
that the number of hot spots within the excitation volume for the
AuNP cluster colloid was estimated to be ≈1,28 indicating that HS normalization reduced the HS-to-HS fluctuation
of SERS signals (Figures S10,11). HS normalization
is possible with νe pseudopeaks set using a range
of long-pass filters (Figure S11) and variable
sampling areas (Figure S12).

Finally,
HS normalization can account for batch-to-batch variability
in substrate performance (Figure 3p,q) as well as differences in substrate identity (Figure 3r,s). To illustrate,
five batches of AuNP/BC were prepared by three separate individuals
and scanned after exposure to 50 μM 4-MBA for 2 h. The CV value
of the Raman band at 1076 cm–1 of 4-MBA decreased
from 55.3% to 5.8% after HS normalization (Figure 3p,q), indicating that HS normalization can
significantly improve batch-to-batch reproducibility of SERS substrates.
Four nanocellulose-based SERS substrates prepared using two different
metals (Au or Ag) and two different reducing agents (NaCit or NaBH4) were scanned by Raman after exposing to 50 μM 4-MBA
for 2 h. The LSPR of a nanostructure is an important parameter influencing
its SERS enhancement factor.49 The four
substrates exhibited different extinction spectra (Figure S13). The intensities of the Raman bands and νe collected from the four substrates varied simultaneously
(Figure S14), indicating their LSPRs exerted
the same influence on both types of bands. The CV value of the 1076
cm–1 Raman band decreased from 93.6% to 9.2% after
HS normalization (Figure 3r,s), indicating that HS normalization can significantly improve
the reproducibility across a suite of different SERS substrates.

Our measured CV value of 2.3% is, to the best of our knowledge,
the lowest reported in the literature (Table S2). Such a result is impressive given that the AuNP/BC substrate is
heterogeneous with respect to nanoparticle size, shape, and aggregation
state and thus the numbers of 4-MBA molecules associated with any
given “hot spot” (NA) will
not be 100% identical across the map. Most approaches to achieve low
CV values rely on expensive lithographic techniques or apply highly
specialized analyte dosing or added internal standards.17,50,51 As shown in Table S2, Sepaniak et al. produced a highly homogeneous SERS
substrate by electron beam lithography and nanotransfer printing that
exhibited a CV value of 13%.10 Similarly,
well-patterned gold nanocluster arrays fabricated via template-guided
self-assembly exhibited a CV value of 12%.52 Most recently, Chen et al. achieved a then record-low CV value (4.3%)
by “fixing” analytes in a “hot zone” above
an alkanethiolate ligand-regulated AgNP film and using the ligand
as internal standards.17 The fact that
HS normalization works well under challenging imaging conditions suggests
even lower CV values can be achieved with nanoengineered substrates.

We have illustrated the applicability of HS normalization for analytes
that strongly associate with the AuNP surface via a thiol linkage.
However, many analytes only weakly associate with the surface via
electrostatic interactions. Due to their lower surface affinities,
these analytes present the greatest challenge for SERS based quantitation.
To illustrate the broad applicability of HS normalization, SERS maps
were acquired by scanning wet AuNP/BC substrates exposed to four structurally
similar chloroanilines: 2-chloroaniline (2-CA), 3-chloroaniline (3-CA),
4-chloroaniline (4-CA), and 2,4-dichloroaniline (2,4-DCA). Across
this series, the analyte pKa value changes
systematically due to inductive and deductive substituent effects.53 A pH-triggered approach was applied to enhance
surface affinity and ensure consistent molecular alignment on the
AuNP surfaces (Figure S15).7 Maps for 2-CA constructed by tracking the intensity of
its characteristic band at 556 cm–1, νe at 126 cm–1, and the background PL at 1820
cm–1 are shown in Figure 3k–o. The CV of the SERS signals prior
to HS normalization was 61.4%, but was reduced to 7.2% following normalization.
Similar improvements in point-to-point variability were observed for
the other chloroanilines (Figure S16).

νe-Enabled SERS Quantitation
The only
factor that influences the ratio of the Raman and elastic scattering
signals should be the molecular concentration of the target analyte
within a “hot-spot”. To illustrate, a piece of AuNP/BC
hydrogel was fixed at the bottom of a Petri dish (Figure 4a). Immediately after adding
50 μM 4-MBA to the Petri dish, SERS spectra were collected over
time. Prior to 4-MBA addition, only the νe signal
was detected in the Raman spectrum (Figure 4b). Shortly following 4-MBA addition, the
characteristic Raman bands of 4-MBA appear and increase with time.
The HS normalized ratio (= I1076/I84) increases rapidly over the initial 30 min
prior to plateauing after ∼60 min (Figure 4c). The HS normalized reaction curves obtained
using three batches of AuNP/BC virtually overlap, while substantial
deviations were observed in the absence of HS normalization (Figure 4d). This result illustrates
that HS normalization provides a reproducible means to monitor the
adsorption kinetics of analytes onto a plasmonic nanoparticle surface.
Such a result cannot be achieved by use of IEIS. Figure 4 suggests that HS normalization
can be used to study the adsorption and desorption kinetics of many
natural or synthetic compounds onto and from plasmonic surfaces.

kinetics onto AuNP/BC. (b) Selected SERS spectra of 4-MBA collected

the ratio between the Raman band at 1076 cm–1 and

time. (d) Variation of the Raman band at 1076 cm–1 as a function of time. (e) Variation of non-normalized SERS intensities
of 2,4-DCA as a function of their logarithmic concentrations. (f)
Variation of normalized SERS intensities of 2,4-DCA as a function
of their logarithmic concentrations. Error bars reflect the standard
deviation of SERS intensities from three collected average spectra.
Each average spectrum is the average of 400 spectra in a 100 μm
× 100 μm SERS map.

To evaluate how analyte concentration alters the intensity
of the
SERS spectra, the concentrations of four chloroanilines were varied
over a range of 0.25–250 μM and their SERS spectra were
collected (Figure S17). In the absence
of HS normalization, the SERS intensities of the five prominent bands
for 2,4-DCA generally increase with concentration (0.25–250
μM; Figure 4e),
but exhibit substantial variability. Following HS normalization, the
SERS intensities of these characteristic bands exhibit improved linear
relationships versus their logarithmic concentrations (R2 > 0.95) and substantially reduced error (Figure 4f). Similar results
were achieved
with three other chloroanilines (Supporting Information Figure S18) and a series of organic molecules (e.g., anilines with
different functional groups, melamine, MGITC; Figure S19 and Note S3). These results show that HS normalization
significantly improved the quantitation performance of SERS.

HS Normalization
Enables Analyte Quantitation under Highly Variable
Conditions
We have illustrated the capacity for HS normalization
to quantify analyte adsorption to stable SERS substrates. To illustrate
how HS normalization can be applied under dynamic conditions, we used
it to quantify the kinetics of 4-MBA adsorption onto suspended AuNPs.
The kinetics of AuNP aggregation in a water/ethanol cosolvent containing
4-MBA are easily controlled and were recently optimized for the production
of SERS pH probes.28 The lower dielectric
constant of water/ethanol cosolvent, relative to water alone, facilitates
4-MBA mediated AuNP aggregation.54 Following
4-MBA addition, the 4-MBA SERS signal increases only slightly during
the first 40 min and then increases up to 162 min before plateauing
(Figure 5a). It is
well recognized that the increase in the number of 4-MBA molecules
on the AuNP surface and the formation of “hot spots”
due to AuNP aggregation simultaneously contribute to the enhancement
in the SERS signal with time, but these two effects cannot be differentiated
using existing approaches.

Figure 5 (a) Variation of SERS intensity of the Raman
band at 1076 cm–1 of 4-MBA and the ratio of the
Raman band at 1076
cm–1 to νe at 126 cm–1 (I1076/I126) as a function of time; (b) SERS spectra collected from the 4-MBA,
AuNPs, and cosolvent system at the different stages marked in panel
a; (c) Schematic of dynamic process of 4-MBA sorption to AuNP surface
and AuNP aggregation.

As shown by the green curve in Figure 5a, the HS normalized ratio (= I1076/I126) rapidly increases
immediately after mixing of the AuNP suspension and 4-MBA solution
(Phase 1). This increase continued until 114 min, albeit with a slower
rate (Phase 2), prior to plateauing (Phase 3). To explain this process
a schematic is shown in Figure 5c. At the very beginning, AuNPs were present as monomers with
no 4-MBA on their surfaces (State 1). In State 1, the SERS spectrum
only exhibits the Raman bands from ethanol (Figure 5b). State 2 is reached following 4-MBA adsorption
in the first 40 min. In State 2, increasing numbers of 4-MBA molecules
adsorb onto the AuNP surface, but most AuNPs remain as monomers. In
this state, the Raman bands of 4-MBA appear, but are weak due to lack
of “hot spots”. In Phase 2, the surfaces become saturated
with 4-MBA and large numbers of SERS “hot spots” form
due to AuNP aggregation. This results in a very strong 4-MBA SERS
signal for State 3. In Phase 3, fewer 4-MBA molecules remain available
to associate with the AuNPs, yet “hot spots” continue
to form. The increase in the 4-MBA SERS signal during Phase 3 is attributed
primarily to “hot spot” formation and not continued
4-MBA adsorption.

Conclusions
Theoretical and experimental
analysis suggests that ASE light elastically
scattered by a SERS “hot spot” quantitatively reflects
the integrated strength of the localized electromagnetic field. The
ratio between the elastic and inelastic scattering signals is dependent
on the number of the target analytes (NA) within a “hot spot” regardless of how the size, shape,
pattern, and density of plasmonic nanostructures varies. Surface-enhanced
elastic scattering can be applied as a truly intrinsic internal standard
for SERS. Following HS normalization, the uniformities of colloidal,
hydrogel, and solid SERS substrates are improved without additional
cost. Internal standards based on surface plasmon enhanced elastic
scattering signals are truly intrinsic to the plasmonic nanostructures
and provide new features that improve quantitative SERS analysis:
(1) ultimate photostability (i.e., not photobleachable); (2) minimal
spectral interference by analyte Raman signals; (3) no spatial competition
with analyte molecules for SERS “hot spots”; (4) reduced
SERS substrate preparation costs by avoiding the incorporation of
extrinsic reference probe molecules molecules; (5) universal applicability
for a suite of SERS substrates; and (6) the capacity to differentiate
analyte adsorption and “hot spot” formation under dynamic
conditions. We close by noting that while HS normalization can provide
improved quantitation that it nonetheless remains highly important
that the affinity of any given analyte to the plasmonic surface as
well as the impacts of potential interferents are fully considered
when determining concentration.
