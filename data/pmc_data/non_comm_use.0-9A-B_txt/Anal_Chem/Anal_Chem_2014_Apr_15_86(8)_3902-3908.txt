Understanding
the microtubule-dependent behaviors of viruses in
live cells is very meaningful for revealing the mechanisms of virus
infection and endocytosis. Herein, we used a quantum dots-based single-particle
tracking technique to dynamically and globally visualize the microtubule-dependent
transport behaviors of influenza virus in live cells. We found that
the intersection configuration of microtubules can interfere with
the transport behaviors of the virus in live cells, which lead to
the changing and long-time pausing of the transport behavior of viruses.
Our results revealed that most of the viruses moved along straight
microtubules rapidly and unidirectionally from the cell periphery
to the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) near the bottom of the
cell, and the viruses were confined in the grid of microtubules near
the top of the cell and at the MTOC near the bottom of the cell. These
results provided deep insights into the influence of entire microtubule
geometry on the virus infection.

==== Body
Many viruses
hijack the endocytic
pathway to enter host cells and utilize the microtubule-dependent
transport to deliver their genomes to specific compartments for replication.1−4 Understanding the microtubule-dependent behaviors of viruses in
live cells is thus critical for revealing the mechanisms of virus
infection and endocytosis. Extensive efforts have been devoted to
deciphering virus infection pathways, and several reports have indicated
that the viruses move along microtubules from the cell periphery to
the perinuclear region in a rapid and unidirectional way.5−8 However, detailed microtubule-dependent transport behaviors of viruses
remain poorly investigated. Microtubule is a component of cytoskeleton
and essential for the intracellular transport of cargos based on molecular
motors.9−11 Kinesin and dynein are both intracellular motor proteins
that move unidirectionally in opposite directions along microtubules,
which may lead to the complex movements along microtubules in live
cells.10,12−14 In vitro and in vivo
experiments indicated that the intersection of microtubules, which
is a tethering point for cargos, can influence the cargo movements.14−17 Such observations raise the question whether the microtubule intersections
or other microtubule configurations can influence the microtubule-dependent
transport behaviors of viruses during their infection.

Here,
we chose avian influenza A H9N2 virus as a model to dissect
the microtubule-dependent transport behaviors of influenza viruses
in live cells. Influenza A virus is an enveloped virus, consisting
of eight segmented single-stranded negative-sense RNA, and the genome
segmentation enables influenza viruses to own the advantage of genetic
reassortment.18,19 Due to the reassortment among
viruses, new types of influenza viruses that are more dangerous to
human and animals can arise easily. In the past decades, the outbreaks
of several disastrous pandemics have confirmed that the influenza
A virus is a very significant risk to public health.20−23 The recent human infection with avian influenza A H7N9 virus has
again proven that it is urgent to investigate the infection mechanism
of influenza viruses in order to fight the virus infection.24,25

In this work, we used quantum dots (QDs) to label the viruses
and
tracked the individual viruses in live cells by the single-particle
tracking technique, which allowed us to globally visualize the microtubule-dependent
motion behaviors of viruses in live cells for a long time. Our single-virus
studies showed that the virus moved along microtubules via six types
of motion behaviors, including the previously reported unidirectional
rapid movement in live cells, and the distribution of the motion behaviors
was related to the distribution of the complex microtubule configuration.
These results indicated that the movement of the virus along microtubules
was a complex process and influenced by the complex configuration
of microtubules.

Experimental Section
Cell Culture and Virus
Propagation
Madin-Darby canine
kidney (MDCK) cells were cultured with Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 100 μg/mL streptomycin sulfate,
100 U/mL penicillin G, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco). For
transfection and fluorescence imaging, MDCK cells were planted onto
a 20 mm Petri dish and 35 mm glass-bottomed Petri dish (NEST Corp),
respectively, for 24 h before experiments. Avian influenza A virus
(H9N2) strain was propagated in the allantoic cavity of 10-day-old
embryonated eggs. After purification by ultracentrifugation and density
gradient centrifugation, the viruses were harvested, aliquoted, and
stored at −70 °C before use.6

Labeling Virus Envelope with QDs
To label the virus
with QDs, we used the strong interaction of biotin–streptavidin
to link biotinylated viruses with streptavidin-modified QDs (SA-QDs).
To modify viruses with biotin, 100 μL of purified viruses was
incubated with 0.1 mg of EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Thermo) at room
temperature for 2 h. A NAP-5 column (GE Healthcare) was used to remove
unbound biotin and 0.22 μm pore size filters removed virus aggregates
before fluorescence imaging. A two-step method was used to label the
biotinylated viruses with SA-QDs (Wuhan Jiayuan Quantum Dots Co.,
Ltd., China) as reported.6 First, biotinylated
viruses were added to the MDCK cells at 4 °C for 10 min. After
being washed with PBS containing 0.1% BSA, the MDCK cells were incubated
with SA-QDs (2 nm) under the same conditions.

Labeling Microtubule of
MDCK Cell
To label the microtubules
of MDCK cells, the cells were transfected with the plasmid expressing
GFP-microtubule-associated protein 4 (GFP-MAP4).26 To transfect cells in a 20 mm Petri dish, 0.5 μg
of DNA and 1 μL of lipofectamine LTX reagent were mixed in 100
μL of Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Gibco). After 30 min,
the lipofectamine LTX-DNA mixture was added to the cell culture. After
incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, the medium was changed and the cells
were then plated on a 35 mm glass-bottomed Petri dish for 6 h before
fluorescence imaging.

To label microtubules with immunofluorescence,
the cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room
temperature and exposed in PBS containing 5% (w/v) BSA and 0.1% (w/v)
Triton-X 100 for 30 min at 37 °C. After being washed with PBS
containing 1% (w/v) BSA, the cells were incubated with tubulin-beta-monoclonal
antibody (Abnova) for 1.5 h and Dylight 649-conjugated goat antimouse
IgG (Thermo) for 40 min at 37 °C to stain microtubules, and the
cells were then incubated with 5 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 for 30
min at 37 °C.

Fluorescence Imaging
Fluorescence
images were acquired
with a spinning-disk confocal microscope (Andor Revolution XD), which
was equipped with an Olympus IX 81 microscope, an EMCCD (Andor iXon
DV 885K single photon detector), a Nipkow disk type confocal unit
(CSU 22, Yokogawa), and a cell culture system (INUBG2-PI). Hoechst
33342, GFP, 605 nm QDs, and Dylight 649 were excited with 405, 488,
561, and 605 nm lasers, respectively. The fluorescence signals were
separated with 447/60, 525/50, 617/73, and 685/40 nm band-pass emission
filters, respectively. For multicolor imaging, fluorescence signals
were detected separately with the EMCCD by the corresponding different
channels.

Image Analysis
Each frame of the movies was denoised
with a gauss filter. Kymograph image and orthogonal slice view were
both obtained by Andor IQ software (Andor technology). To track the
QDs-labeled virus, Imaging-Pro-Plus software (Media Cybernetics Inc.
USA) was utilized. The MSD of each trajectory was calculated for each
time interval by the user-written program with Matlab.27

Results and Discussion
Distribution of Microtubules
and Influenza Viruses in Live Cells
First, we labeled the
influenza virus with QDs by biotin–streptavidin
interaction as reported previously.6 The
specificity and efficiency of QDs to label influenza viruses were
confirmed by incubating cells only with streptavidin-modified QDs
and immunolabeling the hemagglutinin of the virus with Dylight 649,
respectively (Figure S1 in Supporting Information).

Earlier studies have shown that influenza virus can be transported
via microtubules to the perinuclear region of the host cell for RNA
release.6,7 To investigate the relationship between
microtubules and viruses during virus infection, we immunolabeled
the microtubules of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, which
were infected by the QDs-labeled influenza virus for 40 min and analyzed
the distribution of virus in live cells. Using three-dimensional fluorescence
imaging, we observed that the configurations of microtubules differ
from near the bottom, i.e., close to the dish which cell is attached
to, to near the top of the cell (Figure 1A).
The obvious straight microtubules mainly existed in the range of 0–2
μm from the bottom of the cell, while the microtubules mostly
intersected with each other in the upper part of the cell. Furthermore,
we observed different microtubule configurations from the perinuclear
region to the cell periphery. The microtubules in the region from
the cell periphery to the perinuclear region were mostly linear but
intersected with each other in the perinuclear region of the cell.
Figure 1B–E showed that the QDs signals
were accumulated in the perinuclear region of the cell, where the
microtubules intersected with each other. Three-dimensional imaging,
e.g., Movie S1 in Supporting Information, showed that the viruses were accumulated to the microtubule organizing
center (MTOC) of the cell. Interestingly, we found that viruses moved
unidirectionally in the range of 0–2 μm from the bottom
of the cells. These results raised the questions of how the virus
moved in different regions of the cell and how the various configurations
of microtubules influenced the movement behaviors of viruses in live
cells.

Six Types of the Microtubules-Related Motion Behaviors of Viruses
To investigate the influence of microtubule configuration on the
movement behaviors of the virus, we monitored the movement of QDs-labeled
viruses along microtubules in live cells by single-particle tracking
in real time. We observed that many viruses moved along microtubules
rapidly in a directed and regular motion mode, similar to that reported
previously.6,7 In addition, we monitored the movement of
viruses in cells treated with nocodazole, a microtubule-disrupting
drug (Figure S2 in Supporting Information). In such cells, the movement of the virus was limited near the
cytomembrane, indicating that the rapid transport of the virus was
indeed dependent on microtubules. However, we also found the motion
behaviors of viruses were complex frequently when the viruses encountered
the intersections of microtubules. Statistical analysis revealed two
distinct motion behaviors of viruses: movement along microtubules
and movement confined to the certain microtubule regions/configurations.
For those viruses that moved along the microtubules, there were four
types of motion behaviors (Figure 2A–D):
moving unidirectionally along microtubules (Type 1); decelerating
near an intersection of microtubules and subsequently moving back
along the same microtubule (Type 2); decelerating near an intersection
of microtubules and then continuing to move along the same microtubule
in the same direction (Type 3); and decelerating near an intersection
of microtubules and then moving along another microtubule (Type 4).

an intersection of microtubules and moving along the same microtubule

time plots of the movements shown in A–D, respectively. The
red lines are the fits to MSD = 4Dτ + (Vτ)2 + constant (D and V are the diffusion coefficient and mean speed of the particle,
the constant term was due to noise), and the black lines indicate
the plots cannot be fitted due to the abnormalities of the movements.

To investigate the dynamic features
of the different motion behaviors,
we analyzed the typical trajectories of viruses in detail. It has
been reported that actin filaments and microtubules are required for
cellular delivery and transport by motor proteins and involved in
the infection of influenza viruses. Myosin is the molecular motor
that transports cargos along microfilaments at a speed of about 0.1–0.4
μm/s,28−30 while kinesin and dynein, the molecular motors traveling
along microtubules, move faster than myosin, at a speed of several
μm/s.31 Additionally, cellular movements
can also be characterized in terms of the dependence of mean square
displacement (MSD) on time. The linear, upward, and downward relationships
in MSD indicate the movements are in normal diffusion, directed motion
with diffusion, and anomalous diffusion, respectively. Therefore,
the speed and motion mode of the particles moving in cells are often
thought of as the important criteria to determine whether they move
along actin filaments or microtubules. As motors travel along microtubules
normally at a speed of several μm/s, if the speed of viruses
moving along microtubules is below 0.5 μm/s, this would suggest
that the microtubule-dependent movement is interfered by some mechanisms.31

Figure 2A showed
the typical Type 1 virus
movement. The virus kept on moving rapidly along the microtubule (Movie
S2 in Supporting Information) with a speed
higher than 0.5 μm/s (Figure 2E). On
the basis of the relationship of the MSD vs time, we found that the
virus moved in a directed motion mode, with the diffusion coefficient
(D) and fitting velocity (V) of
0.043 μm2/s and 0.95 μm/s, respectively (Figure 2I). The result is consistent with the microtubule-dependent
movements reported previously.6

A
typical Type 2 movement was shown in Figure 2B. The virus moved along the microtubule rapidly and then
slowed down near an intersection, followed by a sudden return to the
opposite direction along the same microtubule (Movie S3 in Supporting Information). The speed vs time plot
showed that the virus was decelerating at the intersection to a speed
below 0.5 μm/s (Figure 2F). The MSD vs
time plot also suggested that the movement was in a directed motion
mode with D and V of 0.229 μm2/s and 0.18 μm/s, respectively (Figure 2J). These results indicated that the D was
in the range of the microtubule-dependent movement, while the fitting
velocity is very low and similar to the actin filaments-dependent
movement reported previously.7 Thus, the
deceleration of the virus movement may be caused by the redistribution
of the force exerted on vesicles by molecular motors at the intersection
and resulted in the complexity of the dynamic information about intracellular
transport.

We also observed that, in some cases, when reaching
the intersection
of microtubules, the virus slowed down and then moved forward in the
same direction along the same microtubule (Type 3). The snapshots
of a typical movement of this kind were shown in Figure 2C (Movie S4 in Supporting Information). The speed vs time plot suggested that the virus slowed down to
below 0.5 μm/s at the intersection and then moved rapidly along
the same microtubule again (Figure 2G). On
the basis of the MSD vs time plot, we found that the movement did
not belong to any type of motion modes mentioned above (Figure 2K). The results suggested that the intersection
significantly influenced the movement of the virus and hindered the
analysis of motion mode under the conditions.

In some other
cases, when the virus reached the intersection, the
virus was found to abandon the original microtubule and move along
another microtubule (Type 4). The snapshots and a movie for this type
of motion were shown in Figure 2D and Movie
S5 in Supporting Information, respectively.
Here, we found that the virus slowed down to below 0.5 μm/s
at the intersection and subsequently moved rapidly along another microtubule
(Figure 2H). The MSD vs time plot was also
irregular (Figure 2L), similar to that of Type
3.

Unlike the movement along the simple configuration of microtubules
as described above, there were two types of movement with confined
motion behaviors related to the complex configurations of microtubules.
Figure 3A showed a virus confined within a
grid formed with several microtubules (Type 5 motion behavior) (Movie
S6 in Supporting Information). Analyzing
the speed and MSD vs time plots, we found that the speed of the virus
was below 0.25 μm/s (Figure 3E) and the
motion behavior was consistent with the anomalous diffusion mode with
the D and α value of 0.002 μm2/s and 0.59, respectively (Figure 3F), indicating
that the virus was confined by the grid of microtubules. In addition,
another confined movement was observed at the intersection of several
microtubules, where the virus was confined to the intersection, the
Type 6 motion behavior (Figure 3B and Movie
S7 in Supporting Information). The speed
and MSD vs time plots suggested that the virus moved slowly with the
speed below 0.25 μm/s (Figure 3G) and
the movement was in anomalous diffusion mode with D and α value of 0.001 μm2/s and 0.74, indicating
that the virus was confined by the intersection (Figure 3H). Kymograph images further confirmed that the movements
were slow and confined by the two kinds of microtubule configuration
(Figure 3C,D). Our analyses indicated that
these two confined motion behaviors were similar to each other except
the types of microtubule configurations where the virus was confined.

several microtubules. (A) Snapshots of a virus being confined by a
grid formed by microtubules (Scale bar: 2 μm). (B) Snapshots

viruses shown in A and B, respectively (Scale bar: 0.5 μm).

vs time plots of the movements shown in A and B, respectively. The
red lines are the fits to MSD = 4Dτα (α is a coefficient and α < 1).

Taken together, the complex configurations of microtubules
appeared
to bring about different types of motion behaviors of the virus. When
a virus underwent the various motion behaviors mentioned above successively,
the infection pathway of the virus could be full of twists and turns
(Figure S3A and Movie S8 in Supporting Information). The speed vs time plot showed that the virus moved very irregularly
along the microtubules (Figure S3B in Supporting
Information). Analyzing the MSD vs time plot, we found that
the movement was still in directed motion mode with the D and V values of 0.070 μm2/s and
0.081 μm/s, respectively (Figure S3C in Supporting Information). This result demonstrated that the D value could reflect the characteristic of the microtubule-dependent
movement, even though the complexity of microtubules led to the irregular
fitting speed. The result confirmed that the D value
could be used to estimate whether the movement of viruses was related
to microtubule or actin filament.

Intracellular Distribution
of Microtubule-Related Motion Behaviors
As mentioned above,
the configuration of microtubules was different
in different regions of the cell. Herein, we chose ten cells randomly
from six parallel experiments to further investigate the distribution
of the six types of motion behavior mentioned above in live cells.
We statistically analyzed the motion behaviors of viruses related
to microtubules and obtained 1183 trajectories of the viruses. The
percentages of the six types of motion behavior were about 28%, 19%,
2%, 22%, 21%, and 8%, respectively (Figure 4D), suggesting that the directed rapid motion mode (Type 1) as reported
previously6,7 was just the main motion behavior of viruses
moving along microtubules.

of the cells. (A–C)

microtubules (green), and the overlapped image of panels A and B (Scale
bar: 20 μm). (D–F) Distributions of six types of the
movements in the whole cells, near the Microtubule organizing center
(MTOC), and in the region from the cell periphery to the MTOC region,
respectively.

Given the different patterns
of microtubule configuration in the
upper and lower halves of the cells, we first studied the motion behaviors
of the virus in the lower part of cells. Considering the morphological
differences of microtubules between the MTOC region (the white circle
in Figure 4C) and the region from the cell
periphery to the MTOC region, we studied the distribution of motion
behaviors in the two regions. At the MTOC region, the percentages
of the six types of motion behavior were 16%, 8%, 1%, 9%, 55%, and
11%, respectively (Figure 4E), indicating that
Type 5 movement was the main motion behavior of viruses at the MTOC,
i.e., the viruses were mainly confined by the grids formed by microtubules
here. We further used the QDs-labeled virus to infect the DiO-labeled
MDCK cells (DiO is a membrane dye) (Figure S4 in Supporting Information). The signals of QDs always colocalized
with DiO signals in the cytoplasm and accumulated in the perinuclear
region, suggesting that the viruses were trapped in vesicles and transported
to the MTOC region. Thus, it was speculated that the grid of microtubules
might be the support structure of vesicles at the MTOC. In contrast
to the MTOC, we found that the percentages for the different motion
types in the region from the cell periphery to the MTOC region were
31%, 22%, 3%, 25%, 12%, and 7%, respectively (Figure 4F), indicating that the directed rapid motion mode (Type 1)
was the main motion behavior of the virus in this region. These two
contrasting distribution patterns of the motion types explained why
the viruses converged to the perinuclear region in a directed rapid
motion mode. The percentages of Type 2 and Type 4 behaviors were also
large in the region from the cell periphery to the MTOC, suggesting
that the intersection of microtubules indeed interfered with the movement
of viruses along microtubules.

We next studied the motion behaviors
of the virus in the upper
part of cells by the same method. As shown in Figure 5, four viruses represented by four arrows with different colors,
respectively, were essentially motionless on the complexly crossed
microtubules (Figure 5A and Movie S9 in Supporting Information). Kymograph images showed
that the four viruses were confined to the regions (Figure 5B). The speeds of viruses were below 0.5 μm/s,
and the motion modes were anomalous diffusion modes with small values
of D based on the speed and MSD vs time plots, respectively
(Figure 5C,D). These results suggested that
viruses in the upper part of cells were mainly confined by the grids
or intersections of microtubules. The motion behaviors of the virus
were relatively simple, mostly the fifth and sixth types of motion
behaviors, owing to the grids and intersections of microtubules.

μm2/s and 0.895 (orange), 0.0037 μm2/s and 0.432 (blue), 0.0048 μm2/s and 0.248 (pink),
and 0.0047 μm2/s and 0.177 (purple), respectively.
The four different colored lines in C and D refer to the four different
viruses shown in (A).

Conclusions
Given the obvious importance of understanding
virus infection,
there have been extensive studies on the movement of viruses in cells.
These earlier studies revealed that the movement of viruses in cells
is dependent on microtubules and further suggested that the movement
along microtubules is a simple directed rapid process.7 Our live-cell imaging of the virus infection process for
the first time revealed that the infection process was much more complicated.
By studying the behaviors of viruses moving along microtubules by
the real-time and long-term SPT technique based on the superior optical
properties of QDs, we showed that there were many types of complicated
motion behaviors of viruses in addition to the previously reported
directed rapid motion mode (Figure 6). On the
basis of statistical analyses, we found that the distribution of virus
motion behaviors was different in different regions of the cell and
that the grid of microtubules may be the support structure of vesicles
in live cells. The complex transport behaviors of viruses may be caused
by the interactions of multiple motor proteins brought about by the
complexity of microtubule configurations. Earlier studies have suggested
that it is important to monitor the process of viruses converging
rapidly from cell membrane to perinuclear region in the study of the
transport dynamics of viruses in cells.6,7 Our research
shows that only by choosing the appropriate locations within a cell
can we observe the process of rapid converging movement of viruses
in cells. For MDCK cells, the most appropriate cell level to track
viruses is the region from the bottom to 2 μm of cells. Our
findings have not only revealed the importance of intracellular structures
for cellular transport by endocytosis but also raised cautions about
interpreting the data about intracellular virus movement without carefully
considering the cellular locations and distribution of different types
of virus movement.
