Small
compounds cannot bind simultaneously to two antibodies, and
thus, their immunodetection is limited to competitive formats in which
the analyte is indirectly quantitated by measuring the unoccupied
antibody binding sites using a competing reporter. This limitation
can be circumvented by using phage-borne peptides selected for their
ability to specifically react with the analyte–antibody immunocomplex,
which allows the detection of these small molecules in a noncompetitive
format (PHAIA) with increased sensitivity and a positive readout.
In an effort to find substitutes for the phage particles in PHAIA,
we explore the use of the B subunit of the Shiga-like toxin of Escherichia coli, also known as verotoxin (VTX),
as a scaffold for multivalent display of anti-immunocomplex peptides.
Using the herbicides molinate and clomazone as model compounds, we
built peptide–VTX recombinant chimeras that were produced in
the periplasmic space of E. coli as
soluble pentamers, as confirmed by multiangle light scattering analysis.
These multivalent constructs, which we termed nanopeptamers, were
conjugated to a tracer enzyme and used to detect the herbicide–antibody
complex in an ELISA format. The VTX–nanopeptamer assays performed
with over a 10-fold increased sensitivity and excellent recovery from
spiked surface and mineral water samples. The carbon black-labeled
peptide–VTX nanopeptamers showed great potential for the development
of a lateral-flow test for small molecules with a visual positive
readout that allowed the detection of up to 2.5 ng/mL of clomazone.

==== Body
The immunodetection
of low molecular
mass substances holds great promise for rapid detection of a vast
number of small analytes of clinical, toxicological, or environmental
interest. Technically, the preferred format would be a two-site noncompetitive
assay based on the use of capture and detection antibodies, which
is the standard sandwich-type assay used for macromolecular analytes.
This format allows the use of an excess amount of antibody driving
the antigen–antibody reaction, even in the presence of trace
amounts of analyte, thus providing high assay sensitivity.1 In addition, the two-site recognition “double-checks”
that the right target analyte is being detected, maximizing the assay
specificity. Unfortunately, high affinity antibodies bind small compounds
(immunologically referred to as haptens) in deep pockets that bury
most of their surface.2,3 Upon formation of the hapten–antibody
immunocomplex (IC), there is no room for the binding of a second antibody,
and thus, these compounds are almost exclusively detected by using
competitive immunoassays. To optimize the competition, limiting amounts
of reagents need to be used, curbing the assay sensitivity. Previously,
we have shown that by using small peptide loops, it was possible to
focus the recognition of the IC to the changes produced at the binding
pocket upon binding of the hapten.4 These
peptides are selected from phage display libraries upon panning with
the desired IC, and the phage-borne peptides can then be used to develop
noncompeptive phage anti-immunocomplex assays (PHAIA).

Applied
to different small compounds, the PHAIA assay provided
and increased sensitivity when compared with the competitive format
performed with the same antihapten antibody,4−6 and improved
specificity.7 Behaving as robust and versatile
assay components,8 the phage particles
are unconventional reagents for the immunoassay industry, and their
biological nature can become a safety issue. Although synthetic monovalent
peptides cannot substitute for the phage-borne peptide, we recently
demonstrated that the complexes of commercial streptavidin or avidin
with biotinylated anti-immunocomplex synthetic peptides do, showing
assay parameters similar to those of the PHAIA.9

To explore additional scaffolds for multivalent display
of these
peptides, we thought of using the Shiga-like toxin, which has a pentameric
structure. The Shiga-like toxin B-1 of Escherichia
coli, also known as verotoxin (VTX) is a highly potent
exotoxin that enters host cells and inhibits protein synthesis. It
is the smallest of the AB5 bacterial toxin family, which
consists of an active A subunit associated with a pentamer of receptor-binding
B subunits.101 The recombinant B subunit
of VTX has been shown to oligomerize in a doughnut-like pentamer10 that is fully capable of host cell binding in
the absence of the A subunit.11 There are
two isoforms of the nontoxic subunit, B-1 and B-2 that share 57% identity.
The 7.7 kDa B-1 subunit forms more stable oligomers12 and has been used to increase the avidity of monodomain
antibodies selected from phage libraries.13,14 The use of the B subunit as a scaffold for multivalent display is
facilitated by the fact that its N-terminus is exposed to the solvent
and radiates out from the periphery of the pentamer core (Figure 1), and in addition, recombinant VTX and VTX chimeric
proteins are produced in E. coli with
high yield (tens of milligrams per liter of culture).13

In this work, we built VTX-based nanopeptamers using
anti-immunocomplex
peptides selected against the herbicides molinate and clomazone bound
to their cognate antibodies. These nanopeptamers were produced at
high yields as soluble recombinant proteins and showed assay performances
similar to the respective phage-borne peptides.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Mouse IgG monoclonal antibodies (mAb) 14D7
and 5.6 against molinate and clomazone, respectively, were prepared
as described before.15,16 Molinate was a gift from Stauffer
Chemical Co, and clomazone was purchased from Riedel-de Haën,
Seelze, Germany. Protein G affinity, BPER (bacterial protein extraction
reagent), AminoLink reductant sodium cyanoborohydride and horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) were purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL). NAP-5
columns prepacked with Sephadex G-25, molecular weight markers, and
the Superose 12HR 10/30 column were from GE Healthcare (Buckinghamshire,
UK). Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters and other common filters were
purchased from Millipore (Billerica, MS). The anti-HA-peroxidase antibody
and Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail were from Roche Diagnostics
(Indianapolis). High performance pigment carbon black JY-101P was
a kind gift from Hangzhou Juychem Co. (Zhejiang, China). The BCA (Bicinchoninic
Acid Kit) for protein determination, bovine serum albumin (BSA), Tween
20, IPTG (isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside), poly(ethylene
glycol) 8000 (PEG), 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB),
and other common chemicals were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).

Assembling of the Anti-immunocomplex Nanopeptamer Genes in the
pNvtx Vector
To build the pNvtx vector (Figure 1), the peptide pA-VTX cassette shown in (Figure S-1A of the Supporting Information) was synthesized by Integrated
DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA). This cassette codes for
the peptide pA (CSLWDTTGWC), which is specific for the molinate-mAb
14D7 immunocomplex,4 and the verotoxin-B
subunit lacking the signal sequence (amino acid sequence 21–89,
EMBL M16625: nt 1349–1555). Peptide pA is flanked by the N-terminal
sequence GTASGSA– and is tethered to the N-terminus of the
VTX subunit by the −LQGGGSGGGS– spacer. The pNvtx vector
was built by digestion of the two noncomplementary SfiI sites of the
cassette and its subsequent cloning into a modified pET28a+ vector
(Novagen) between the OmpA signal peptide and the 6 × His and
HA (hemeagglutinin) tags (Figure 1). The KpnI and PstI restriction sites were engineered
to allow for the substitution of the anti-immunocomplex peptide in
the pNvtx vector. To this end, two complementary oligonucleotides
encoding the new peptide sequence are used, which upon annealing produced
the DNA insert with the corresponding overhangs for its cloning with
these two enzymes. The pairs of oligonucleotides used in this study
for cloning of three anti-immunocomplex peptides specific for the
clomazone–mAb 5.6 complex are shown in Figure S-2 of the Supporting Information. All vectors were electroporated
in competent BL21(DE3) E. coli cells
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Expression and Purification
of the VTX Nanopeptamers
Small cultures of individual colonies
of BL21(DE3) E. coli cells, transformed
with the peptide-VTX constructions,
were grown to check for DNA sequence and expression of the chimera.
Selected colonies were used for large-scale production of the nanopeptamers
by growing them in 500 mL of LB kanamycin (50 μg/mL) at 37 °C,
with shaking at 250 rpm, to an absorbance of 0.5 AU at 600 nm. The
cultures where then induced with 1 mM IPTG, incubated for 3 h and
centrifuged at 5000g for 15 min at 4 °C. The
periplasmic extracts were prepared as described by Olichon et al.17 Briefly, the cell pellets were resuspended in
10 mL of 200 mM Tris, 20% sucrose, 0.5 mM EDTA and pH 8.0 TES buffer
and were frozen at −80 °C and thawed to room temperature.
After that, 5 mL of TES buffer was added, and the resulting solutions
were incubated for 30 min on ice and further diluted with 3 mL of
TES and 12 mL of H2O. After 30 min on ice, the extracts
were centrifuged at 30 000g for 20 min at
4 °C. The supernatants were supplemented with NaCl and imidazole
up to 0.3 M and 20 mM, respectively, and directly used for purification.
To this end, 30 mL of this periplasmic extract was applied to a Ni-NTA
column (HisTrap HP 1 mL, GE Health Care, Pittsburgh, USA) equilibrated
with a buffer of 50 mM Na2HPO4, 0.3 M NaCl,
20 mM imidazol, pH 8. The column was then washed with 5 column volumes
of the same buffer, and the protein was eluted (1 mL fractions) by
increasing the concentration of imidazole to 500 mM. After dialysis
against PBS, the recombinant nanopeptamers were supplemented with
Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail and sodium azide 0.05%. The protein
concentration was determined using the BCA kit, and the preparation
was filtered (0.22 μm) and stored in aliquots at −80
°C until used.

Analysis of the Oligomeric Status of the
Nanopeptamers by Size-Exclusion
Chromatography (SEC) and Online Multiangle Light-Scattering (MALLS)
The MWs of the nanopeptamers were determined by SEC-FPLC coupled
with an UV detector (SPD-20A, Shimadzu), a refractive index detector
(RID-10A; Shimadzu), and a three-angle SEC-MALLS/RI (size-exclusion
multiangle laser light scattering/refractive index) detector (Wyatt
Technologies, Goleta, CA) using a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (GE
Health Care, Pittsburgh) run with phosphate buffer saline, pH 7.5
(PBS), at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The VTX nanopeptamer (2 mg/mL)
was applied to the column, and the elution was monitored with UV,
IR, and MALLS detectors. The MW standard proteins chymotrypsin (2
mg/mL, 24.8 kDa), ovalbumin (OVA 2 mg/mL, 44.3 kDa), and BSA (2 mg/mL,
66.5 kDa) were used to build an elution-time calibration curve using
the IR and UV detectors. BSA was also employed as a calibration protein
for the MALLS detector system. The absolute MW calculations with MALLS
were performed using a refractive index increment, dn/dc, of 0.186 mL/g.18 All data were collected and processed with ASTRA software (v4.73.04,
Wyatt Technology, Goleta, CA).

Nanopeptamer ELISA for
Molinate and Clomazone
Microtiter
plates were coated with the appropriate amount of antibody in PBS
(optimized by checkerboard titration) for 1 h at 37 °C, blocked
with PBS–BSA 1% at 37 °C for 30 min, and washed three
times with PBS 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). Wells were dispensed with 50
μL of the herbicide standards in PBS or water samples plus 50
μL of the optimized dilution of the nanopeptamer-HRP conjugate
(Supporting Information) in PBST. After
1 h of incubation and washing, 100 μL of the peroxidase substrate
(0.4 mL of 6 mg/mL 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine in
DMSO, 0.1 mL of 1% H2O2, in 25 mL of 0.1 M citrate
acetate buffer, pH 5.5) was added to each well, and the reaction was
stopped after 10 min by addition of 50 μL of 2 N H2SO4. Absorbance was read at 450/650 nm in a microtiter
plate reader (Multiskan MS, Thermo Labsystems, Waltham, MA). For the
analysis of field samples, the reaction mix was supplemented with
20% of interference buffer (1 M Tris, 0.3 M NaCl, 0.3 M EDTA, 1% BSA,
pH 7.4).

Carbon Black Nanopeptamer Labeling
A 5% solution of
carbon black in Milli-Q water was homogenized in a sonication water
bath and was then diluted 25-fold with 5 mM boric buffer, pH 8.8.
A 120 μg portion of nanopeptamer in 5 mM boric buffer, pH 8.8
(about 100 μL), was combined with 900 μL of the 0.2% carbon
black solution and incubated for 3 h at room temperature. The suspension
was then centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 15 min, and the pellet
was resuspended in 1 mL of 100 mM boric buffer, pH 8.8 and 0.05% Tween
20 by sonication. After repeating this step three more times, the
carbon-labeled nanopeptamer was resuspended in 1 mL of 100 mM boric
buffer, pH 8.8; 0.05% Tween 20; and BSA 1% and kept at 4 °C until
used. The same procedure was used for labeling a single domain antibody
(VHH) fused to the HA tag that was used as the positive control.

Lateral Flow Immunochromatography
mAb 5.6 and anti-HA
tag antibody lines were printed on Hi-Flow Plus 120 nitrocellulose
membrane cards at 0.30 μg/cm using a BioDot AD 1500 liquid dispenser
(BioDot, CA). A 50 μL portion of PBS 0.1% Tween 20 supplemented
with 1 μL of the carbon black nanopeptamer and control VHH suspensions
was dispensed in microtiter wells and mixed with 50 μL of PBS
0.1% Tween 20 containing different concentrations of clomazone. Strips
cut from the printed cards (4 mm) were dipped into the wells and allowed
to develop for 20 min.

Results and Discusion
Cloning and Expression
of Recombinant Verotoxin B Subunit As
Fusion Protein
Figure 1 shows a general
scheme of the generation of the VTX nanopeptamers and their use as
immunoassay reagents. To assess the functionality of VTX as a scaffold
for high-avidity display of anti-immunocomplex peptides, we initially
assembled the peptide pA-VTX construct into the pNvtx vector (Figure 1). Peptide pA has been previously isolated from
a phage library panned against the immunocomplex (IC) of the herbicide
molinate with mAb 14D7. It reacts specifically with the IC but not
with the uncombined antibody, allowing the sensitive detection of
the herbicide in the PHAIA format.4 Preliminary
experiments of expression of the pA-VTX chimera in IPTG-induced E. coli BL21(DE3) showed that the fusion protein
occurred as a single SDS-gel band of ∼13 kDa, which is in agreement
with the estimated MW of the pA-VTX monomer (12 840 Da). A
large portion of the fusion protein was found in the insoluble fraction,
but still a significant amount was soluble (Figure 2). For practical reasons and because of good yields (about
10 mg per liter of culture), we decided to work with this soluble
fraction, from which the nanopeptamers were purified by immobilized
metal affinity chromatography (Figure 2).

assay using verotoxin for multivalent display of anti-immunocomplex
peptides isolated by phage display. (A) Once the anti-immuncomplex
peptide is selected from phage libraries, (typically displayed on
the major capside protein pVIII), its coding sequence is cloned into
the pNvtx vector (B) fused to the VTX gene. The OmpA signal peptide
is used for periplasmic expression of the peptide–VTX nanopeptamer
monomers, which spontaneously oligomerize, forming the pentavalent
nanopeptamer. (C) The high avidity of the recombinant nanopeptamer
conjugated to peroxidase (HRP) can then be used to detect the formation
of the immunocomplex, in a two-site antibody–nanopeptamer immunoassay.

The pA-VTX Nanopeptamer
Adopts a Pentameric Structure in Solution
The oligomerization
of the recombinant nanopeptamers was studied
by size-exclusion chromatography using online light scattering, UV,
and refraction index (RI) detectors (SEC-MALLS-RI). pA-VTX eluted
as a single symmetric peak at 12.4 mL (Figure 3a), which by comparison with the protein standards corresponds to
an apparent MW of 64 kDa, being in good agreement with the calculated
MW of 64 205 kDa for the pentameric structure of pA-VTX. This
was confirmed, independently of hydrodynamic considerations, by the
SEC-MALLS analysis. The molecular mass curve obtained with this method
showed a homogeneous distribution of molecular masses along the elution
of the pA-VTX peak, with an average value of 64 kDa (Figure 3b). This confirms that in solution, the conformational
state of the nanopeptamer is that of a homogeneous pentameric structure,
with light dispersion properties corresponding to a monodisperse protein.

The pA-VTX-Nanopeptamer Allowed the Sensitive
Detection of Molinate
Once the pentameric nature of the nanopeptamer
was established,
we confirmed its reactivity against the molinate/mAb 14D7 immunocomplex
by ELISA using the HA tag for detection (data not shown). Then, to
simplify its use as immunoassay reagent, the purified nanopeptamer
was conjugated to HRP using a 1:4 pA-VTX-to-HRP molar ratio (Supporting Information). The assay concentration
of coating antibody and pA-VTX peroxidase were optimized by checkerboard
titration, as described before,9 and were
used to develop the VTX-nanopeptamer ELISA for molinate. The dose–response
curves had a typical sigmoid shape with signal saturation at a high
concentration of analyte (Figure 4). However,
as observed before with other PHAIA assays,5,19 the
slope was rather steep, limiting the dynamic range of the assay. This
may be related to the multivalent nature of the interaction, which
would rapidly increase as soon as the density of immunocomplexes on
the solid phase increases along with the concentration of the analyte.
The midpoint of the titration curve, corresponding to the concentration
of analyte giving 50% of signal saturation (SC50) was SC50 = 5.4 ± 0.3 ng/mL, and the limit of detection (LOD
= analyte concentration giving a 10% increase over the zero signal)
was 1.9 ng/mL for molinate.

Figure 4 Noncompetitive ELISAs performed with the pA-VTX
nanopeptamer. mAb14D7
(10 μg/mL) was used for coating, and pA-VTX (5 μg/mL)
was added in the presence of increasing molinate concentrations. All
measurements were performed in triplicate, and error bars represent
the standard deviation.

These parameters were similar to those obtained with the
phage-borne
peptide, SC50 = 8.5 ± 0.2 ng/mL,4 or with the streptavidin nanopeptamer prepared with commercial
high-sensitivity streptavidin–HRP functionalized with the biotinylated
synthetic peptide pA, SC50 = 8.3 ± 0.2 ng/mL, and
LOD = 1.2 ng/mL.9 This indicates that the
spatial distribution of the peptides in the VTX nanopeptamer allows
attainment of a similar avidity interaction with the immobilized IC
than that achieved with the streptavidin or the phage display. Moreover,
using the midpoint of the assay titration curve for comparison, the
SC50 of the pA-VTX molinate assay was ∼13-fold more
sensitive than the IC50 (analyte concentration causing
50% inhibition) of the competitive ELISA set-up with the same antibody
(IC50 69 ± 0.5 ng/mL).16

Transfer of
Different Anti-IC Peptides from the Phage to the
VTX-Nanopeptamers Does Not Affect Their Reactivity
To further
test the versatility of VTX as a scaffold, we used the herbicide clomazone
and its cognate antibody mAb 5.6 as an alternative model system. In
a previous study,15 we selected 18 phage
clones against the clomazone/mAb 5.6 IC from a random 8-mer disulfide
constrained library, which could be grouped into four peptide sequences
(Table 1). Out of these sequences, the phage-borne
peptide ICX11 produced the most sensitive PHAIA test. On the basis
of the consensus sequence of those four peptides, we built a saturation
mutagenesis library using the p8 V2 phagemid vector20 to evolve peptides with higher affinity for the clomazone
IC. The library (2 × 108 independent clones) had the
generic sequence CxxxPNxExC, where capital letters represent the invariant consensus
residues and the “x” represents a fully
randomized position. The selection of this library (Supporting Information) was performed against limiting amounts
of the clomazone/mAb 5.6 IC, under stringent conditions (including
a 5-day prolonged final washing step) to promote the isolation of
a second generation of peptides with improved affinity for the IC,
which could translate into better assay sensitivities. Fourteen clones
were selected and are listed in Table 1.

A more complex consensus sequence emerged, with Ala in third and
eighth positions, and a small hydrophobic residue (Val, Ala, Leu,
Ile) in the sixth position. After a preliminary screening, two clones
were selected that in the PHAIA format exhibited the highest SC50 differences (3–4-fold) with the phage-borne peptide
ICX11 (Figure 5a, Table 2). Those two peptides, ICX05m and ICX09m, differed only in positions
1 and 2 and were used together with peptide ICX11 to compare changes
in the assay performance when the peptides were moved from the phage
to the VTX display. The assay performance of the VTX nanopeptamers
built with these peptides is shown in Figure 5b and summarized in Table 2. There were no
major differences between the PHAIA and the nanopeptamer assays, and
despite the small drop in sensitivity in the case of ICX05m and ICX09m,
it can be concluded that the VTX nanopeptamer–HRP conjugate
can substitute for the phage particles, representing a convenient
option for the development of noncompetitive assays for small molecules.

Good Recoveries Were Obtained When Different Water Samples Were
Analyzed with the VTX Nanopeptamer Assay
Because of its sensitivity,
the pICX09m-VTX HRP conjugate was used to assess the assay performance
with real water samples spiked with clomazone. These samples comprised
surface water samples collected from a region of Uruguay with no record
of clomazone use, as well as mineral and tap water. The assay was
performed with the addition of an “interference buffer”
that contained a bulk protein (BSA), a chelating agent, and high salt
concentration to avoid the matrix effect caused by humic acids and
other interfering compounds in the samples. Under these conditions,
undiluted samples could be directly analyzed with very good recoveries,
even for the smallest concentrations tested, as is shown in Table 3.

The VTX Nanopeptamers Can Be Used to Set up Lateral-Flow Test
with a Positive Readout
Lateral flow assays are a salient
option as point of care tests because they are simple and fast and
do not require specialized equipment. In addition, the formation of
a colored test line over a white background is easily detected by
the naked eye, making the test instrument-free. Unfortunately, competitive
assays have to be developed into lateral-flow tests with a “negative”
readout, in which the presence of the analyte causes an absence of
signal, affecting its sensitivity and making its interpretation more
difficult. We recently showed that nanopeptamers formed by the complex
of avidin with biotinylated synthetic peptides could be used to develop
a sensitive lateral-flow test with a positive readout.9 This had not been possible with the use of phage-borne
peptides, probably because of the filamentous structure of the M13
phage particles that may form aggregates upon labeling with carbon
black, as has been reported when using colloidal gold.21 To test whether the VTX scaffold could also
allow the development of lateral flow tests, we labeled the pICX09m-VTX
nanopeptamer with carbon black and evaluated the ability of the assay
to detect low concentrations of the analyte. Figure 6 shows a typical result. The formation of a reaction line
visible to the naked eye, as judged by four independent observers,
was evident even for the lowest concentration assayed, 2.5 ng/mL.
That was in agreement with the analysis by densitometry using the
IMAGEJ software (NIH, USA).

Figure 6 Noncompetitive nanopeptamer pICX09-VTX lateral-flow
test for clomazone.
The nitrocellulose strips were tested with buffer PBS containing various
concentrations of clomazone (40, 20, 10, 5.0, 2.5, and 0 ng/mL) as
denoted in the figure. The lower reaction line (test line) corresponds
to the formation of the mAb5.6/clomazone/carbon-labeled pICX09-VTX
trivalent complex, and the upper one (control line), to the interaction
of the anti-HA antibody with carbon-labeled VHH-HA.

Conclusions
The doughnut-like shape
of the B1 subunit of the Shiga like toxin
of E. coli offers a convenient option
to multimerize binding domains with increased avidity. That was the
case of the four anti-immunocomplex peptides used for noncompetitive
detection of molinate and clomazone, in which it allowed the substitution
of the phage particle (900 × 6–7 nm, 1.6 × 107 Da) by oligomeric recombinant nanopeptamers of ∼65
kDa, which constitute conventional and nonbiological immunoassay components.
We recently showed that this was possible using biotinylated synthetic
peptides and commercial avidins; however, the use of recombinant chimera
that already includes the anti-immunocomplex peptide and self-assemble
into a soluble multivalent complex of defined stoichiometry is a substantial
step forward to make nanopeptamers simpler more affordable and easier
to standardize. The fact that the VTX-nanopeptamers can be easily
labeled with carbon black is also a major advantage because it allows
the development of a lateral-flow test with a more intuitive positive
readout, a feat that is not possible with the competitive format.
