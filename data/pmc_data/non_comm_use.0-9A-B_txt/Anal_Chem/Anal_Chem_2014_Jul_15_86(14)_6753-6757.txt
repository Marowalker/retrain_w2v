Performance characteristics
of gas-phase microsensors will determine the ultimate utility of these
devices for a wide range of chemical monitoring applications. Commonly
employed chemiresistor elements are quite sensitive to selected analytes,
and relatively new methods have increased the selectivity to specific
compounds, even in the presence of interfering species. Here, we have
focused on determining whether purposefully driven temperature modulation
can produce faster sensor-response characteristics, which could enable
measurements for a broader range of applications involving dynamic
compositional analysis. We investigated the response speed of a single
chemiresitive In2O3 microhotplate sensor to
four analytes (methanol, ethanol, acetone, 2-butanone) by systematically
varying the oscillating frequency (semicycle periods of 20–120
ms) of a bilevel temperature cycle applied to the sensing element.
It was determined that the fastest response (≈ 9 s), as indicated
by a 98% signal-change metric, occurred for a period of 30 ms and
that responses under such modulation were dramatically faster than
for isothermal operation of the same device (>300 s). Rapid modulation
between 150 and 450 °C exerts kinetic control over transient
processes, including adsorption, desorption, diffusion, and reaction
phenomena, which are important for charge transfer occurring in transduction
processes and the observed response times. We also demonstrate that
the fastest operation is accompanied by excellent discrimination within
a challenging 16-category recognition problem (consisting of the four
analytes at four separate concentrations). This critical finding demonstrates
that both speed and high discriminatory capabilities can be realized
through temperature modulation.

Sensors are needed for an ever-increasing
spectrum of chemical monitoring applications, ranging from environmental
monitoring and process control to health screening and medical monitoring.1−4 The demand is linked to developing point, network, and even “wearable”
deployment scenarios where laboratory analytical instruments are inappropriate
for size, cost, and operator skill requirement reasons. Development
of small chemical sensors further benefits from the continued advancement
of programmable electronics and low-cost communications support technology.
However, the sensors must be “chemically reliable” and
perform suitably in real world conditions that often involve recognizing
trace-level targets in mixtures and dynamic backgrounds on an acceptable
time scale. Electronic-nose (e-nose) technology, often based upon
chemically induced resistance changes of the sensing elements (chemiresistors),
is making some inroads toward meeting these demands for gas-phase
analyses.5−7 Multielement arrays can offer increased recognition
capabilities in complex mixtures via the use of multiple cross-selective
sensing materials (and multiple operational modes), and nanostructured
materials have helped to provide higher target sensitivity within
these microdevices. There have also been advances in enhancing signal
information content for better performance through the use of modulation
techniques for individual chemiresistors or e-nose elements, which
can include, for example, operating-temperature modulation,8−13 gas-delivery modulation,14,15 and analysis of the
resultant transient signals.16−18 Considerably less attention has
been focused, however, on increasing the speed with which microsensors
can report on the introduction, presence, and concentration of analytes
within a sampled volume.19−22 It is worth noting, though, that sensors based upon
different operating principles can demonstrate fast responses, including,
for example, oxygen sensors for automotive applications that use ionic
conduction in solid electrolytes at high temperature (<1 s).23

In this work, we have investigated whether
purposefully driven transient phenomena based upon rapid temperature
modulation can offer a route to speeding the analytical performance
of a chemiresistive microsensing device. Faster recognition and quantification
would enable sensors to track variations of molecular species in dynamic
situations, ranging from those encountered in process control of reactors
to those relevant in time-resolved breath diagnostics during respiration.
While concentrating on speed, we have also explored whether our methods
are suitable for maintaining an analytically informative data stream
that permits good discrimination of similar compounds and varied concentration
levels.

Temperature is clearly a prime factor in chemical reaction
kinetics and in the interactions that occur in most chemical transduction
processes, including those occurring with metal oxide semiconductors.24,25 Our approach involves a simple operational mode with rapid (dwell
time at each temperature step ranging from 20 to 1000 ms), two-temperature
modulation of a microsensor’s operating temperature to alter
surface adsorbate populations and the rates of interfacial phenomena
including adsorption, desorption, diffusion, and reaction. We also
tune the sensor for fastest operation by systematically varying the
temperature-modulation frequency. Utilizing a challenging 16-case
discrimination problem, featuring four similar chemical analytes at
four concentrations each, we demonstrate that our two-temperature
rapid modulation approach not only reduces the response time of a
single sensor element (<10 s) but also, and most importantly, demonstrates
high discriminatory capabilities. The frequency-optimized, bilevel
scheme therefore offers both speed and accuracy and is meant to be
contrasted to prior reports in which more complex sensing schemes
(multipart temperature programs, varied-material arrays) were explored,
primarily to find programs that would enhance selectivity.9,10,26−29

Experiments reported on
here were performed using a single, microhotplate-based element populated
with a thin, nanostructured In2O3 film (Figure 1), a cross-selective sensing material known to respond
with varied amplitude to different analytes.8 Further information on the preparation of this type of microsensor
is given in the Supporting Information.
A second, similarly prepared device was used to confirm the observed
effects using a more limited data set. The analytical challenge we
formulated for this work involves individual exposures to two ketones
(acetone and 2-butanone) and two alcohols (ethanol and methanol),
with four concentration variations (10, 50, 100 and 200 μmol/mol)
for those gas exposures in a dry air background under dynamic conditions
with a constant flow rate over the sensor (see the Supporting Information for additional experimental details).
This analyte set was chosen to be chemically challenging as the sensor
would need to discriminate between four volatile organic chemicals
with pairs of similar chemical functionalities. Ideal sensing results
would allow quick identification of both the analyte present and its
concentration (one of 16 possibilities) based on sets of resistance
measurements made on the In2O3 film using interdigitated
electrodes on the microhotplate platform. The basic temperature cycling
program that we investigated as a transient-driver (enabled by the
low thermal time constant of the microhotplate) is illustrated schematically
in Figure 2. The temperatures of 450 and 150
°C were selected to operate the sensor within its upper and lower
temperature limits, while giving a rapid and large (ΔT = 300 °C) change in temperature between steps. Operation
of the microsensor was performed for a semicycle period (dwell time
at each temperature step), p, ranging from 20 to
120 ms, in 10 ms increments (as well as for p = 1000
ms and ∞) to better characterize and understand response behavior.
Data were examined in sets of “perturbed isotherms”8 assembled from the acquired data at both the
elevated and lower temperatures of Figure 2. As stated above, our primary objective was to determine whether
our cycling approach allowed faster response to a test environment
for identifying a target condition.

micromachined silicon platform containing the three primary components
of the microsensor elements: polycrystalline silicon heater, interdigitated
platinum electrodes, and metal-oxide sensing film. (b) Surface SEM

as described in the Supporting Information.

Figure 2 Plot displaying a 200 ms section of a pulsed-temperature
program for p = 20 ms used to modulate the operating
temperature of the microsensor element of Figure 1a. Shaded areas of the pulsed-temperature sequence in the
figure indicate the maximum (green) and minimum (lavendar) temperature
levels of the modulation sequence and associated points where resistance
is recorded and then utilized to generate the perturbed isotherms
of Figure 3 and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information.

A key observation that highlights the significant potential
of our “driven” modulation approach to quicken chemiresistive
analyses is shown within the panels of Figure 3 for acetone (representative response curves for the other three
analytes are shown in the Supporting Information). Figure 3a,b show the perturbed isotherms,
corresponding to the elevated and lower temperatures, respectively,
for the sensor responding to 200 μmol/mol of acetone with p = 30 ms. Figure 3c–e shows
the “true” isothermal (p = ∞)
response curves for the sensor at 450, 150, and 375 °C, respectively.
The isothermal temperatures correspond to the elevated and lower temperatures
of the pulsed-temperature program (Figure 2) and a midrange temperature between the two limits. The color bands
in the plots denote the duration of analyte exposures (blue represents
short exposures of 12 s and tan represents long exposures of 300 s,
times required to observe essentially the full associated response).
We observe that the response curves for the sensor under modulated
operation appear to be much faster than any of the response curves
under isothermal operating conditions. This response-differential
effect holds true even for the highest temperature examined under
isothermal conditions (Figure 3c), indicating
that the faster responses are not due exclusively to the high sensor
operating temperature but are also derived from the temperature modulation.
These response curves suggest that the change in response-time behavior
may be attributable to kinetically limited surface and charge-exchange
processes. The sensor responses to the three other analytes show qualitatively
similar effects (Figure S1, Supporting Information). To better quantify the effect, the response times, τR, were mathematically calculated as the time required for
the rate of change of the sensor signal to reach ≤2% of the
maximum, with the time, t, when the sensor resistance
starts to change in response to the analyte introduction set to t = 0 s. Figure 4 summarizes the
τR numbers for the four studied analytes as a function
of p. We note that for large p (1000
ms, ∞), the sensor does not truly reach its full ΔRsensor, so we estimate the average τR in those cases as ≈55 s and >300 s, respectively.
Thus, for p = 30 ms, the average response time of
the sensor for these analytes is at least a factor of 32 faster than
the isothermal response time (9.3 s compared to 300 s).

both the perturbed and the unperturbed isotherms for the microsensor
responding to 200 μmol/mol of acetone. Panels a and b show examples
of the resulting perturbed isotherms corresponding to the elevated
(450 °C) and lower temperatures (150 °C), respectively,
for the sensor heating element modulated at p = 30
ms. Panels c, d, and e show trace response examples for the sensor
in true isothermal operation at elevated (450 °C), lower (150
°C), and midpoint (375 °C) temperatures, respectively. Shaded
areas of the plots indicate regions of analyte exposure, with blue
indicating a 12 s dose and tan indicating a 300 s dose.

These results indicate that a
prime goal of the study was met, in that a simple, speed-enhancing
modulation method has been identified. However, speed alone would
not be acceptable if discrimination capabilities for the fast operation
were greatly diminished. It may be natural to assume that slower operation
might offer superior recognition, as nature often provides trade-offs
in performance characteristics. However, that assumption need not
be necessarily true. Prior work has shown that the introduction of
modulated operating temperatures (multiple base and excursion values)
can enrich the analytical information content, particularly if one
is not fixated on response speed.10,11,26,27,30 In this work involving rapid two-level temperature cycling, we specifically
examined the relative ability of the single microsensor to discriminate
the sample cases of target exposure for the p value
found to be fastest (p = 30 ms). We also examined
discrimination capabilities for p = 1000 ms and p = ∞ (i.e., isothermal operation, a common mode
that commercial sensors and many sensor researchers utilize). In all
cases, the data from the elevated-temperature response curves were
used for analysis. The discriminatory capabilities of the sensor responses
were quantified by using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier31 on a feature-extracted data set that represents
each response to an analyte exposure as an aggregate of nine features
based upon the maximum amplitude change, and an exponential moving
average transform of the transient portion of the response curve (see
the Supporting Information for more details).32

We first examined a chemical-recognition
problem where any concentration of one of the four analytes is to
be correctly reported as that given analyte (Table 1). Then we investigated results for a more challenging, semiquantitative
16-class problem where the four concentrations for each of the four
analytes were also to be discriminated (see confusion matrices in
Tables S1–S3 in the Supporting Information, summarized here as Table 2). For p = 30 ms, and a 9.3 s response time, the recognition seen
in both Tables 1 and 2 is remarkably good, especially for a single microsensor. We note
that isothermal operation is least desirable, as it is very slow and
offers poorer discrimination, owing to the limited information content
when operating at a single temperature.16−18 For slow modulation
at p = 1000 ms, the discriminatory capabilities of
the sensor are similarly good, if not better in quantification, but
sensor responses are slower on average by a factor of ≈5 than
for the p = 30 ms modulation. The high-performance
recognition is tied closely to the observation that temperature modulation
takes the signal stream from highly correlated, i.e., redundant, content
(for continuous isothermal operation) to much lower correlation (for
modulated perturbed isotherms).

Our
frequency-dependent (frequency = 1/(2p) or ≈17
Hz for p = 30 ms) perturbed isotherm methodology
is successful and allows for both rapid and accurate sensing. We contrast
these results (two temperatures and frequency as a parameter) with
prior work from our group and others.8−10,13,19,26,27 In those studies, when concentrating only
on selectivity, we previously used multiple elements and inherently
long and rather involved (to add analytical power) pulsed-temperature
programs (long operational sequences), devised with excursions to
cover many temperatures from one or multiple base levels.9,26 In other cases we collected extensive databases in order to design
custom programs with very specific discrimination capabilities8,10 or a more complicated processing approach that identified and used
only certain data from the acquired database.27 In other work, the temperature dwell times did not reside in the
range of 10 ms as here, but rather used 0.5 s pulses in static environments13 or 5–10 s steps.19 We further note that other “front-end” approaches,
such as capillary diffusion of a static gas or stop flow for modulating
analyte delivery, have also been employed for improving the sensing
capabilities of single sensors.14,15 The approach here is
quite distinct in how it directly taps into the kinetic phenomena
of the sensing process by using a rapid bilevel modulation, variation
of p, and a straightforward optimization to identify
where the greatest response speed occurs. Despite the relative simplicity
of the approach, both speed and excellent recognition are attained.

The effects that we observe are both scientifically interesting
and practically useful. The modulation mode shown in Figure 2 drives transient adsorption/desorption/diffusion/reaction
phenomena at the surface of the In2O3 as the
microdevice platform cycles quickly between short dwell times at 150
and 450 °C, and also passes quickly and repeatedly through all
temperatures between these end points. In this way, the temperature
modulation manipulates adsorbate populations in a way that defines
the signal stream.24,25 Our frequency-dependent results
(Figure 4) indicate that the square-wave thermal
history of the oxide produces a minimum response time for interactions
and transduction centered about 30 ms dwell times. This observed minimum
value is the convolution of multiple temperature-dependent time constants
that are involved for these dynamic interactional processes as well
as for the transduction of surface charge transfer events into measurable
conductance changes across the semiconducting In2O3 film (which may involve percolation phenomena and trap states
in the oxide).33 The fact that a common
trend for the four analytes with changing p is observed
(see Figures 3 and 4, Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) suggests that the time range for these processes is relatively
similar for these volatile organic test gases. We note that temperature
modulation effects on sensor response kinetics have also been suggested
for sensors operating even under lower-frequency modulation schemes
but not to achieve the level of time savings that we present.19,34,35 Coupled electronic and spectroscopic
measurements are required to delve more deeply into the mechanistic
details (e.g., exploration of electronic transport effects and vacancy-defect
population variations)33,36 of the enhanced response speed
connected to our bilevel modulation.

We believe that the present
work, while involving a single film-based sensing microelement for
demonstration purposes, also has implications for further efforts
on transient analysis17,37 and array configurations where
multiple types of sensors are simultaneously operated. Application
scenarios exist where faster sensor responses to analyte introduction
are useful for better process control (e.g., tracking analyte introduction
and consumption in chemical- or bioreactors) or for better characterization
of pulsed gases (e.g., biological olfaction testing).38 Expanding beyond these well-controlled scenarios, dynamic
analysis situations could incorporate tools for detecting analyte
introduction or even gradual onset.39 It
seems likely too that the cycling and frequency domain concepts may
be applicable to other next-generation microsensors20 and nanosensors, such as single, self-heated nanowires,22 where the inherently low thermal time constants
could/may produce even greater analytical speed and discriminatory
power. On the basis of pulsed-temperature cycling and the specific
results reported here, we are also exploring a more general question
of the trade-off between number of microarray elements and the nature
and complexity of transient-driven and temperature-enriching temperature
programming for their effects on the performance characteristics of
e-noses.
