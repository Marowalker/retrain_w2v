Raman spectroscopy is widely used
for quantitative pharmaceutical analysis, but a common obstacle to
its use is sample fluorescence masking the Raman signal. Time-gating
provides an instrument-based method for rejecting fluorescence through
temporal resolution of the spectral signal and allows Raman spectra
of fluorescent materials to be obtained. An additional practical advantage
is that analysis is possible in ambient lighting. This study assesses
the efficacy of time-gated Raman spectroscopy for the quantitative
measurement of fluorescent pharmaceuticals. Time-gated Raman spectroscopy
with a 128 × (2) × 4 CMOS SPAD detector was applied for
quantitative analysis of ternary mixtures of solid-state forms of
the model drug, piroxicam (PRX). Partial least-squares (PLS) regression
allowed quantification, with Raman-active time domain selection (based
on visual inspection) improving performance. Model performance was
further improved by using kernel-based regularized least-squares (RLS)
regression with greedy feature selection in which the data use in
both the Raman shift and time dimensions was statistically optimized.
Overall, time-gated Raman spectroscopy, especially with optimized
data analysis in both the spectral and time dimensions, shows potential
for sensitive and relatively routine quantitative analysis of photoluminescent
pharmaceuticals during drug development and manufacturing.

==== Body
Most (90%) active pharmaceutical
ingredients (APIs) crystallize as solid particles.1 Different inter- and intramolecular bonding and conformations
in solid-state forms of a substance, such as polymorphs, amorphous
solids, salts, and solvates, result in different physicochemical properties.2,3 Dissolution rate, solubility, stability, and bioavailability, among
other properties, depend on the solid-state structure of the substance.
This poses challenges to the pharmaceutical industry in terms of material
characterization, formulation, processing, and end product quality
control and has therapeutic, legal, and commercial implications.4

Effective methods for evaluating the possible
changes in solid-state structure during research and development,
manufacturing, and storing are needed.5,6 Raman spectroscopy
is an established method for qualitative and quantitative analysis
of APIs exhibiting different solid-state forms and often enables rapid,
nondestructive measurements with no sample preparation needed.7−9 The spectra can be measured through container walls, blisters, plastic
bags, and in an aqueous environment because Raman spectroscopy has
low sensitivity for water.10 The form of
the sample is also flexible; powders, slurries, pellets, emulsions,
and films are all suitable for Raman spectroscopy. These properties
make Raman spectroscopy well-suited for diverse real-time process
monitoring applications.

Raman spectra are obtained by measuring
the intensity distribution of Raman scattered photons from a monochromatic
light source as a function of wavelength.10,11 Quantitative determination is based on the concentration of the
substance of interest being proportional to the integrated intensity
of its characteristic Raman bands.12 Overlapping
peaks of different compounds in a mixture and experimental effects
that are not related to sample concentration complicate the analysis.13 In such cases, multivariate analysis, where
a large amount of spectral data can be included, is more reliable
than methods where only one or a few spectral features are considered.
Several multivariate methods have been established for the interpretation
of Raman spectra.14,15 The aims of such methods are
to (i) extract spectral information that quantifies substances of
interest, (ii) estimate the uncertainties of the quantification, and
(iii) evaluate the performance of the built model.14 Partial least-squares (PLS) regression is one of the most
widely used chemometric methods for quantitative analysis.16 PLS relates the information in two data matrices, X (e.g., the spectral variation) and Y (e.g.,
the sample composition), in a multivariate model by maximizing their
covariance.17 Kernel-based regularized
least-squares (kernel-based RLS) regression is another approach that
has the ability to learn functions from the nonlinear data features
which, when combined with feature selection algorithms such as greedy
forward feature selection, optimizes the use of information provided
by the data features.18,19 PLS and RLS are quite similar
in that they aim to shrink the solution away from the ordinary least-squares
solution toward the directions of the variable space of large sample
spread with lower variability.20

Error sources in the quantitative analysis of powder mixtures using
Raman spectroscopy include intra- and interday variation
of the Raman instrument, changes in room temperature and humidity,
sample fluorescence, mixing, packing, and positioning, as well as
sample particle size and compactness.21,22 While most
issues can be addressed with suitable spectral processing and data
analysis approaches, complete subtraction of fluorescence without
any instrument-based methods is difficult, even with sophisticated
algorithms.10

Complete or partial
rejection of the fluorescence signal from the Raman signal is possible
with various time-resolved techniques.23 The ability to detect the arrival time and energy of each photon
allows assessment of the lifetime of both the fluorescence and Raman
signals. Due to the lifetime differences, rejecting the fluorescence
background is possible (Figure 1). Time-gated devices employ short, intensive laser pulses
and the sample response is recorded simultaneously with the pulses.
This also means that analysis in ambient lighting is possible.24

Figure 1 Relative lifetimes (not to scale) of Raman and photoluminescence
(including fluorescence) signals (adapted from ref (25)).

Time-gating can be realized with various detection systems
such as time-resolved photomultiplier tubes,26,27 high-speed optical shutters based on a Kerr cells,28,29 intensified charge-coupled devices,30 quantum dot resonant tunneling diodes,31 and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor single-photon avalanche
diodes (CMOS SPADs).24 One of the essential
advantages of CMOS SPADs is the ability to reject both the photoluminescence
tail and the photon noise.32 SPADs are
realized in standard CMOS technology and contain a pn junction which
is reverse-biased above its breakdown voltage, meaning that entry
of even a single photon can trigger avalanche breakdown that can then
be recorded.33−35 The width and position of the time gate need to be
properly selected.36

The current
CMOS SPADs are compact and inexpensive while being able to achieve
adequate temporal resolutions (subnanosecond).37−39 CMOS SPAD detectors
have been used to evaluate fluorescence lifetimes.40 More recently the applicability of CMOS SPADs for fluorescence
rejection in Raman spectroscopy in pharmaceuticals has also been shown.25,36,41

The aim of this study was
to investigate the potential of time-gated Raman spectroscopy for
quantitative analysis of fluorescent pharmaceutical solids. A time-gated
Raman setup using a fast CMOS SPAD detector39 was employed for the first time for quantitative analysis of powder
mixtures. This instrument allows the separation of the photoluminescence
signal from the Raman signal in ambient lighting and enables stronger
Raman signal generation compared to traditional instruments.38,39 The data, with and without prior time-domain selection (based on
visual inspection), was analyzed using PLS regression, the most well
established multivariate quantitative spectral analysis method in
pharmaceutics. Quantitative analysis was also performed using kernel-based
RLS with greedy feature selection, which statistically optimized data
use in both the spectral and time domains.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Piroxicam (PRX) (Hawkins, USA), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drug, was the fluorescent model compound in this study. PRX has six
reported polymorphs (β (I), α1 and α2 (both also
referred as form II), III, IV, and V)) and one hydrated form (monohydrate,
MH).42−47 Ternary powder mixtures used in this study consisted of the most
commonly observed forms: β, α2, and MH.

The PRX
was purchased in form β, and this form was used as received.
PRX form α2 was prepared by recrystallization from a saturated
solution in absolute ethanol.46 PRX MH
was prepared by recrystallization from saturated aqueous solution.48 The aqueous solution was heated to 80 °C
and the ethanol solution to 70 °C, and the solutions were slowly
cooled to room temperature before vacuum filtration.

Evaluating
Polymorph Conversion
X-ray powder diffractometry (XRPD) analysis
was performed using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker, Germany)
with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5418 Å) over
a 2θ range of 5–40°, using a step size of 0.01°,
step time of 0.5 s, voltage of 40 kV, and current of 40 mA. The results
were compared to the patterns in the Cambridge Structural Database
(CSD). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements
were performed with a Bruker Vertex 70 spectrometer (Bruker Optik,
Germany) and an ATR accessory with a single reflection diamond crystal
(MIRacle, Pike Technologies, Madison, WI, USA). The obtained spectra
were the mean of 64 scans and have a spectral range from 650 to 4000
cm–1 with a resolution of 4 cm–1. The ATR spectra were converted to absorbance spectra with OPUS
software (version 5.0, Bruker Optik, Ettlingen, Germany). Differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed with a differential scanning
calorimeter (DSC823e, Mettler Toledo AG) in sealed perforated aluminum
pans under dry nitrogen purge (50 mL/min) at a heating rate of 10
°C/min from 30 to 210 °C. Particle size and morphology of
the PRX solid-state forms were examined by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) with a Quanta 250 FEG (FEI Inc., U.S.). Samples for SEM were
mounted on carbon-coated double-sided tape (Agar Scientific, Germany)
and sputter-coated with a 5 nm layer of platinum (Q150T Quomm, Turbo-Pumped
Sputter Coater, China).

Mixture Design
The powder mixtures
were prepared according to a special cubic mixture design (Figure 2).49 The mass ratio of each form was varied between 0, 1:6,
1:3, 2:3, and 1 in the mixtures, and the center point (1:3, 1:3, 1:3) mixture was
prepared in triplicate. A ternary mixture design was preferred over a binary
mixture design because often more than two solid-state forms are potentially
present in a process environment. The solid-state forms of PRX were
carefully mixed using geometric dilution with a card to avoid inducing
changes in the solid state.

Figure 2 Mixture design employed in the experiments.

Time-Gated Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectra of the mixtures of different solid-state forms of
PRX were collected with a TimeGated TG532 M1 Raman spectrometer (TimeGate
Instruments Oy, Finland) coupled with a BWTek sampling probe with
a focal spot size of approximately 85 μm (Figure 3). The Raman instrument was equipped with
a picosecond pulsed laser, CMOS SPAD array detector, and sampling
probe. The excitation source was a 532 nm Nd:YVO microchip pulsed
laser. The average power used was 14 mW (2.235 mW after the probe),
repetition rate 40 kHz, pulse width 150 ps, focus diameter 50 μm,
pulse energy 0.35 μJ, peak power 2 kW, and maximum irradiance
28 MW cm–2.

Figure 3 (a) Schematic of the time-gated Raman instrument
used for obtaining the Raman spectra and performing fluorescence rejection
and (b) basis for bin 3 selection. The four bins collect the scattered
photons with different delays and the intensity of the obtained signal
varies. Bin 3 provided the strongest signal at the optimal time frame
for detection of Raman scattered photons for PRX.

The detector was a 128 × (2) × 4 CMOS SPAD matrix
detector.39 The internal time histogram
of the detector consisted of four bins accumulating single-photon
arrivals. Bin 3 provided the strongest Raman signal with the present
setup (Figure 3). The
signals collected with bin 3 were used for the data analysis. The
time-resolved spectral data sets were collected by sequentially moving
the gate in 50 ps steps using the electronic delay generator. Raman
spectra with fluorescence rejection and time-resolved fluorescence
spectra were acquired simultaneously. The spectra were obtained from
the Raman shift range of 700–1700 cm–1 up
to 5.5 ns.

The measurements were conducted in triplicate, with
continuous sample rotation, and the focal point was moved between
each measurement to acquire a more representative signal over a larger
area of the sample. The measurements were carried out at ambient temperature,
lighting, and humidity. Cyclohexane was used as a reference standard
to monitor wavenumber accuracy. Data acquisition and setup control
were performed with the instrument software (TimeGated Model 1).

Continuous Wave (CW) Raman Spectroscopy
Raman measurements
were executed with a home-built Raman setup in a backscattering geometry
using 532 nm excitation produced with a CW single frequency laser
(Alphalas, Monolas-532-100-SM). The beam was focused onto the sample
and subsequently collected with a 100× microscope objective (Olympus
100× with 0.70 N.A.). The scattered light was dispersed in a
0.5 m imaging spectrograph (Acton, SpectraPro 2500i) using a 600 g/mm
grating (resolution: ∼5–6 cm–1). The
signal was detected with EMCCD camera (Andor Newton EM DU971N-BV)
using 60 μm slit width. The Rayleigh scattering was attenuated
with a notch filter (Semrock). The sample positioning was performed
with an XYZ-piezo scanner (Attocube, ANPxyz101) with the smallest
step of 100 nm in each direction. The laser power was ∼0.5
mW, and two 5 s measurements were averaged for each accumulation.

Partial Least-Squares (PLS)
Part of the fluorescence was
rejected from the signal by the time-gated detection system using
the data obtained from bin 3 data. Residual photoluminescence (elevated
baseline) signal was removed using the software provided with the
instrument (TimeGated Model 1). The time frame for analysis was selected
manually based on visual appearance of the signal. The location of
the Raman peaks in the time domain was found to be at the delay of
0.4–0.8 ns. Baseline correction was performed using adaptive
iteratively reweighted penalized least-squares (airPLS) and local
minima fitting (Lmin) algorithms. Data from the whole time domain
without selecting a specific time frame (0.0–5.5 ns) was processed
identically with the selected time frame data for comparison.

PLS is widely used for quantitative Raman spectral analysis of pharmaceutical
samples. In general, PLS finds components known as latent factors
in variable matrix X which best predict the response
matrix Y. PLS regression searches for a set of factors
that simultaneously decompose X and Y where
these factors explain the covariance between the two matrices as much
as possible.50 The spectral data was standard
normal variate (SNV) transformed51 and
mean centered (without scaling) prior to PLS analysis. SNV and mean-centering
have been shown to be suitable algorithms for quantitative analyses
of solid-state mixtures by vibrational spectroscopy.21 PLS regression52 for quantitative
analysis was carried out with the NIPALS algorithm17 using SIMCA-P software (version 13.0.3, Umetrics AB, Sweden).

The performance of the model was evaluated using R2X,
R2Y, and the root-mean-square error of cross-validation
(RMSECV). RMSECV values were obtained with leave-one-out cross-validation
(LOOCV), with the leave-one-out procedure performed with all mixtures
except the pure forms (because there is no mixing error associated
with the pure forms), where in each CV round all replicates of one
mixture are left out. The reported RMSECV values are the average of
the root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP) values which were
obtained for the left-out mixtures for each cross-validation round
(eq 1): 1  Here, y – ŷ is the predicted residual for each mixture form of an observation.

Kernel-Based Regularized Squares (RLS)
Part of the fluorescence
was rejected from the signal by the time-gated detection system using
the data obtained from bin 3 data as in the previous section. To further
investigate the quantification potential of the 3D spectra in both
the spectral and time dimensions, fast kernel-based RLS analysis with
multitarget greedy feature selection was applied. All predictive models
were trained with the Python-based machine learning software library
RLScore.19 RLS with a Gaussian kernel was
built as the prediction model. Given a training set {(xi,yi)}ni=1 where the feature vector  and the class labels , the multivariate RLS formulation finds A such that (eq 2): 2  where A is the n × q weight matrix, Y is the n × q label matrix, ∥...∥F is
the Frobenius norm of a matrix, K is
the n × n kernel matrix, λ
is the regularization parameter, and tr is the trace
of a matrix. The following Gaussian kernel function was used in the
models (eq 3): 3  where ∥...∥ is the 2 norm and σ is the kernel width parameter.

A kernel-based
RLS model was obtained by carrying out the following procedure. A
hyperparameter combination consisting of the kernel width parameter,
σ, the regularization parameter, λ, and
the time interval for averaging with SNV and mean centering, was selected
from a three-dimensional grid with LOOCV on a training set. In addition
to the hyperparameter values, a multitarget greedy RLS algorithm was
built to select a predictive subset of Raman shifts.18 Greedy RLS starts from the empty set, and on each iteration
adds the feature (Raman shift) whose addition provides the best LOOCV
performance. To avoid selection bias, the prediction performance of
the obtained kernel-based RLS model was estimated with the standard
nested cross-validation approach in which the selection procedure
described above was separately carried out during each round of an
outer cross-validation, and the performance estimate was the average
of the prediction errors of these models on the data withheld in the
corresponding rounds of the outer cross-validation.53

In addition, to ensure that the performance estimate
would reflect the real-world conditions under which the model is expected
to be used, the fold-partition of the cross-validation was performed
similar to PLS analysis as follows. A LOOCV was applied to the PRX
mixtures, indicating that every replication of each mixture was simultaneously
used as test data and the pure forms were not used for testing.

Given the input vector of a new measurement unseen during the training
phase (left-out mixtures for testing), kernel-based RLS makes a prediction
of its corresponding output vector. The real-value vectors (y = [predicted value of form β, predicted
value of form α2, predicted value of MH]) predicted by the kernel-RLS
model were postprocessed as follows, with the ith
entry of the vector, y, set as (eq 4): 4  

The purpose of this setting was to restrict the mixture proportions
between zero and one and prevent impossible predictions. Later, eq 1 was used as described
earlier to calculate the RMSECV values of each of the three solid-state
forms.

Results and Discussion
Polymorph Conversion
XRPD, FTIR, and DSC analyses confirmed complete polymorph conversion
of form β of PRX (CSD: BIYSEH13)54 to form α2 (CSD: BIYSEH06),46 and
MH (CSD: CIDYAP02).54 No solid-state impurities
were detected. SEM images show clear morphological differences between
the solid-state forms (Figure S1 (Supporting
Information)). Additionally, PCA of the Raman data also showed very
clear differences for all the mixtures with no overlap of the sample
clusters observed.

Raman Spectra and Fluorescence Rejection
Fluorescence, as indicated by the elevated baselines, was observed
in both the CW Raman spectra and the time-gated spectra that were
the sum of the raw signal recorded over the whole time scale (0–5.5
ns) (Figure 4a,b).
Form β fluoresced more strongly than form α2 and the MH.
The baseline increased with increasing Raman shift for all three solid
state forms.

Figure 4 Raman spectra obtained with (a) the CW Raman setup, (b)
the time-gated Raman instrument, presented as sum spectra from 0 to
5.5 ns, and (c) the time-gated Raman instrument, presented as spectra
after fluorescence rejection. The Raman intensity scale is the same
for each solid-state form but different for each of the three columns
for clarity.

Fluorescence rejection
with the time-gated data (using bin 3, 0.4–0.8 ns time frame,
and residual airPLS and Lmin for baseline correction) resulted in
2D Raman spectra with fluorescence-free baselines (Figure 4c). The characteristic peaks
of the solid-state forms of PRX match those previously published.55 The vibrational modes for piroxicam have previously
been predicted and assigned using density functional theory calculations.56

The raw 3D spectra recorded with the time-gated
instrument (bin 3 data), the subtracted 3D baseline spectra (representing
the fluorescence), and the 3D Raman spectra after baseline rejection
from PRX form β, form α2, and the MH are presented in Figure 5. The 3D data indicates
the starting point of the Raman signal immediately after the laser
pulse as well as the fluorescence starting-point and the fluorescence
tail. Consistent with the spectra in Figure 4b, the 3D spectra also suggest the three
solid-state forms of PRX fluoresced to varying degrees over the presented
Raman shift range, with form β exhibiting the strongest baseline
intensity maxima as well as the largest baseline profile change as
a function of Raman shift. The 3D plots also reveal the changing baselines
over time: a rapid initial increase (at all Raman shifts) is followed
by a more gradual decay over several nanoseconds for all three forms.
It is important to note that because the presented data are from bin
3 only, the baseline signal cannot be expected to represent the total
fluorescence signal over the presented time range, with detected signal
intensity biased toward time delays close to the Raman-active time
frame. Bin selection for biased detection was appropriate in this
case because avoiding fluorescence through instrumental means for
improved quantification was one of the aims of the study. Despite
this, it is interesting to note that different baseline decay profiles
are visible for the three different solid-state forms, supporting
previous evidence that not only relative fluorescence intensity (as
a function of Raman shift) but also the fluorescence signal lifetime
profiles can also be solid-state specific. Differences in such decay
profiles have previously been observed using time-gated Raman spectroscopy
with the amorphous and γ-crystalline forms of the drug indomethacin.25

Figure 5 3D spectra obtained with time-gated Raman of (a) raw spectrum
(form β), (b) baseline spectrum (form β), (c) Raman spectrum
(form β), (d) raw spectrum (form α2), (e) baseline spectrum
(form α2), (f) Raman spectrum (form α2), (g) raw spectrum
(MH), (h) baseline spectrum (MH), and (i) Raman spectrum (MH).

After subtracting the detected
baseline spectra from the raw spectra, very little fluorescence signal
was observed and Raman peaks were clearly visible at time delays of
less than 1 ns. Overall, the time-gated Raman instrument and with
baseline processing enabled robust fluorescence rejection without
any requirement for substance specific calibration or suppression
methods. This provided a suitable basis for applying chemometric data
analysis for quantitative solid-state determination.

PLS Regression
The PLS regression used to quantify the mixtures on the basis of
the associated Raman spectra using the 0.4–0.8 ns window was
successful. Traditional PLS models with four PLS factors resulted
in an R2X(cum) of 0.997, R2Y(cum) of 0.982,
and a mean RMSECV of 4.1%, whereas the data from the whole time-domain
without selection of a specific time frame (0.0–5.5 ns) resulted
in a mean RMSECV of 6.7%, R2X(cum) of 0.997, and R2Y(cum) of 0.964 with four PLS factors (Table 1).

a All spectra were pretreated using SNV transformation and mean centering.

Kernel-Based Data Analysis
Iterative
optimization of the time frame (an example of the process is presented
in Figure 6) with the
kernel-based RLS and greedy forward feature selection strongly affected
the quantitative performance. Clear differences were observed in the
quantitative performance between the optimized and nonoptimized time
frames (Table 2). If
the full time frame data was used, mean RMSECV values of 6.2%, at
best, were obtained. However, when the time frame was optimized, the
predictions improved, down to 1.4%. AirPLS (optimized λ = 10)
was found to be most efficient with or without time frame selection.
Overall, this result suggests that kernel-based RLS analysis is a
valid alternative to the PLS approach in this study for quantitative
analysis of time-gated Raman spectra, as indicated by at best approximately
3-fold lower RMSECV values.

Figure 6 Leave-one-out cross-validation mean squared
error (LOOCV-MSE) results from one round of the inner-loop of the
kernel-based RLS model, where the model tries to find optimal parameters
(time-interval, σ2, λ) based on the LOOCV-MSE.
The X-axis represents the number of different time
intervals tested during each round of the model construction to find
the optimal time interval along with the other optimal model parameters.
The time interval corresponding to the lowest LOOCV-MSE was 0.25–0.6
ns in this example.

The Gaussian kernel-based RLS model used in this study
has the ability to learn target functions from the data capturing
the nonlinearity of its features. The kernel-based RLS model accompanied
by careful selection of the Raman shifts, time interval, and the models’
hyperparameters utilizing a nested cross-validation resulted in improved
prediction of the different drug forms in the mixtures. The result
of this study supports exploration of the possibilities of efficient
optimization of the time frame as well as selection of the best Raman
shifts for Raman analysis using kernel based methods and feature selection.

Overall, this study demonstrates that quantitative analysis with
time-gated Raman spectroscopy can be suitable for solid-state analysis
of photoluminescent pharmaceuticals during drug development and manufacturing.
Raman spectroscopy is especially applicable for focusing on the properties
of the API in mixtures and pharmaceutical products. This is because
the functional moieties present in common APIs typically involve aromatic
and π-bonded structures which produce stronger Raman signals
than the aliphatic and polar structures typical of common excipients.
However, in addition to some APIs, many excipients (e.g., cellulose-based
polymers) also fluoresce, which further restricts conventional Raman
analysis for the analysis of pharmaceutical processing and dosage
forms. An additional advantage of the time-gated measurements is that
they can be performed in ambient lighting which facilitates analysis
during pharmaceutical processing. These advantages mean that the time-gated
Raman spectroscopy approach used in this study has much potential
for process monitoring in pharmaceutical manufacturing.

The
Raman signals of piroxicam were able to be detected over the fluorescence
backgrounds. However, in the case of more extreme or complete Raman
signal masking, an instrumental means to avoid fluorescence becomes
essential. Time-gated Raman spectroscopy is one such approach.25

Even
though the PRX Raman bands were still observable without the fluorescence
rejection, quantification was improved by the fluorescence rejection.
Furthermore, the quantitative analysis approach in this study is applicable
to more strongly fluorescing systems, as well as, for example, samples
with high water contents, such as proteins and biological and biochemical
samples. Altogether, the capability of the time-resolved Raman and
fluorescence measurements with a CMOS SPAD detector for quantitative
analysis shows promise in diverse areas, including fundamental chemical
research, the pharmaceutical setting, process analytical technology
(PAT), and the life sciences.

Conclusions
This
study demonstrates that time-gated Raman spectroscopy is a useful
tool for quantifying mixtures of fluorescent materials when conventional
Raman spectroscopy could fail. PLS analysis of the time-gated spectra
allowed quantitative analysis and demonstrated the benefit of time-domain
selection. In this case, statistical optimization of model parameters
using kernel-based RLS further improved the quantitative results.
Overall, the time-gated Raman spectroscopy approach employed shows
potential for relatively routine quantitative solid-state analysis
of photoluminescent pharmaceuticals during drug development and manufacturing.
