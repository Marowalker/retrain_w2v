Protein alkylation by 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal
(HNE), an endogenous
lipid derived electrophile, contributes to stress signaling and cellular
toxicity. Although previous work has identified protein targets for
HNE alkylation, the sequence specificity of alkylation and dynamics
in a cellular context remain largely unexplored. We developed a new
quantitative chemoproteomic platform, which uses isotopically tagged,
photocleavable azido-biotin reagents to selectively capture and quantify
the cellular targets labeled by the alkynyl analogue of HNE (aHNE).
Our analyses site-specifically identified and quantified 398 aHNE
protein alkylation events (386 cysteine sites and 12 histidine sites)
in intact cells. This data set expands by at least an order of magnitude
the number of such modification sites previously reported. Although
adducts formed by Michael addition are thought to be largely irreversible,
we found that most aHNE modifications are lost rapidly in
situ. Moreover, aHNE adduct turnover occurs only in intact
cells and loss rates are site-selective. This quantitative chemoproteomics
platform provides a versatile general approach to map bioorthogonal-chemically
engineered post-translational modifications and their cellular dynamics
in a site-specific and unbiased manner.

==== Body
The covalent
modification of
proteins by endogenous lipid derived electrophiles (LDEs) triggers
cytotoxic and adaptive responses associated with oxidative stress.1,2 Of the dozens of known LDEs, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) is the most
studied, owing to its high reactivity and evidence that it activates
diverse pathways governing cellular signaling and stress.3,4 Understanding how HNE and other LDEs modify cellular proteomes can
offer new insights into mechanisms of chemical toxicity, inflammation,
and disease.

Mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics provides
the means to globally
profile cellular targets of LDEs in complex samples. For example,
we and others have described proteomic methods to identify and quantify
up to several hundred putative protein targets of HNE.5−7 These large-scale studies have not only expanded the catalog of
HNE-protein targets but also presented new insights into how alkylation
damage mediates cellular effects. Nevertheless, a key limitation of
previous methods is that they identified HNE-modified proteins but
did not pinpoint sites of HNE alkylation. Indeed, identification of
protein alkylation sites definitively proves that the modification
occurs. Although several prior studies reported site identification
for protein alkylation by HNE, these have come from analyses of isolated
proteins treated with high concentration of HNE in vitro,8−11 which might not be toxicologically or physiologically relevant.
Proteome-wide mapping of protein sites alkylated by HNE in intact
cells remains an unmet challenge.

Recently, Wang et al.12 reported the
first global, site-specific survey of cysteine targets of LDEs, including
HNE, by a competitive chemoproteomic strategy. Because the method
measured protection by HNE and other electrophiles against cysteine
labeling with a thiol-reactive probe, the method was directed specifically
to thiols. This approach produced the first global, site-specific
characterization of thiol modification by LDEs and identified a subset
of highly reactive thiols, consistent with our previous global proteome
analyses.5 However, these studies were
done in cell lysates, rather than in intact cells, and the thiol-directed
strategy was unable to detect LDE modifications at other nucleophilic
amino acids in proteomes.

Despite these impressive advances
in analysis of LDE–protein
interactions, the molecular selectivity of LDE in cells remains uncertain
with respect to key questions. For example, do LDEs target specific
sequence motifs in proteins? What is the scope of LDE reactions with
nucleophilic amino acids beyond cysteine in cells? What are the dynamics
of LDE-mediated covalent modification in cells, particularly with
respect to adduct stability and turnover?

We recently described
a chemoproteomics method for site-specific
mapping of protein S-sulfenylation in cells,13 in which S-sulfenyl residues are tagged with the alkynyl-dimedone
probe DYn-2, then biotinylated by Click chemistry with a UV-cleavable
azido-biotin (Az-UV-biotin),14 which permits
efficient streptavidin capture and photorelease of tagged, S-sulfenyl
peptides. Quantitative comparisons were achieved with the use of unlabeled
and deuterated DYn-2 probes.

Here we present a new quantitative
chemoproteomic platform to achieve
large-scale, in situ, site-specific identification
and quantification of ∼400 protein alkylation events by the
alkynyl analogue of HNE (aHNE, Scheme 1) in
cells. The results not only greatly expand the inventory of HNE-targeting
sites in complex proteomes but also reveal unexpected instability
of aHNE adducts in a cellular environment. A key feature of the new
method is the use of light and heavy (13C6)-labeled
Az-UV-biotin reagents (Scheme 1), which provide
for quantitative comparisons without the need for isotopically labeled
probes. Thus, our new chemoproteomics platform is broadly applicable
to qualitative and quantitative analyses of modifications by diverse
protein reactive probes or to bioorthogonal-chemically engineered
post-translational modifications.

Scheme 1 Chemical Structures of Light (Red)
and Heavy (Blue) Azido-UV–Biotin
Reagents and Alkynyl Electrophile Probes Used in This Study
Experimental Section
Reagents
Light and heavy (13C6) Az-UV-biotin reagents
were synthesized as described in the Supporting
Information. 2-Iodo-N-(prop-2-yn-1-yl)acetamide
(IPM) and alkynyl HNE (aHNE) were synthesized
as previously described.14−16 Strong cation exchange (SCX)
spin columns were purchased from Nest group (Southborough, MA). Streptavidin
sepharose was purchased from GE Healthcare Life Sciences. HPLC-grade
water, acetonitrile, and methanol were purchased from J.T. Baker (Center
Valley, PA). Other chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise indicated.

Cell Culture and Treatment
RKO cells (American Type
Culture Collection, ATCC, Washington, DC) were maintained at 37 °C
in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere and were cultured in
McCoy medium (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) containing 10%
fetal bovine serum (Atlas Biologicals, Fort Collins, CO). Cells were
grown until 80–90% confluence, rinsed with 1× phosphate
buffered saline (1×PBS, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY)
quickly, and treated with 50 μM aHNE prepared in serum-free
medium for 2 h. Treatments were stopped by removing the medium. Cells
were scraped mechanically and pelleted by centrifugation. For recovery
experiments, cells were cultured as above, treated for 2 h with 50 μM
aHNE, and then either harvested immediately (Control) or incubated
for 1 h or 4 h in serum-free medium without aHNE. Where indicated,
cells were pretreated for 30 min with 10 μM MG132 to inhibit
proteasomal degradation; MG132 was again added to the culture medium
during subsequent incubation.

Sample Preparation
Cell pellets were lysed on ice in
HEPES lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Igepal, pH 7.5) containing
Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Rockford, IL). The lysate was first treated with 4 mM NaBH4 for 1 h at room temperature to reduce aHNE adduct carbonyls and
prevent reversion of Michael adducts. The lysate was further incubated
with 8 mM dithiothreitol (Research Products International, Prospect,
IL) at 75 °C for 15 min to reduce reversibly oxidized cysteines.
Reduced cysteines then were alkylated with 32 mM iodoacetamide for
30 min in the dark. Proteins were then precipitated with methanol–chloroform
(aqueous phase/methanol/chloroform, 4:4:1 (v/v/v)) as previously described.13 The precipitated protein pellets were resuspended
with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate containing 0.2 M urea. Protein concentrations
of these resuspended samples were determined with the BCA assay (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) and adjusted to give a protein concentration
of 2 mg/mL. Resuspended proteins were first digested with sequencing
grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at a 1:50 (enzyme/substrate)
ratio overnight at 37 °C. A secondary digestion was performed
by adding additional trypsin to a 1:100 (enzyme/substrate) ratio,
followed by incubation at 37 °C for an additional 4 h. The tryptic
digests were desalted with HLB extraction cartridges (Waters, Milford,
MA) and then evaporated to dryness under vacuum.

Click Chemistry,
Capture, and Enrichment
Desalted tryptic
digests were reconstituted in a solution containing 30% acetonitrile
in water. The pH of the peptide mixture was adjusted to around six.
Click chemistry was performed by the addition of 0.8 mM either light
Az-UV-biotin or heavy Az-UV-biotin (2.5 μL of a 40 mM stock),
8 mM sodium ascorbate (10 μL of a 100 mM stock), 1 mM tris[(1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl]amine
(TBTA, 2.5 μL of a 50 mM stock), and 8 mM CuSO4 (10
μL of a 100 mM stock). Samples were allowed to react at room
temperature for 2 h in the dark with rotation. The light- and heavy
Az-UV-biotin labeled samples then were mixed together immediately
following Click chemistry. The labeled samples were purified by strong
cation exchange (SCX) chromatography as previously described13 and then incubated with prewashed streptavidin
sepharose for 2 h at room temperature. The streptavidin sepharose
then was washed with 50 mM sodium acetate, 50 mM sodium acetate containing
2 M sodium chloride, and water twice each with vortex mixing or vigorous
rotation to remove nonspecifically bound peptides, and the mixture
then was resuspended in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The suspension
of streptavidin sepharose was transferred to several glass tubes (VWR,
Radnor, PA) and irradiated with 365 nm UV light (Entela, Upland, CA)
for 2 h at room temperature with stirring. The supernatant containing
the photoreleased, tagged peptides was collected, evaporated to dryness
under vacuum, and stored at −20 °C until analysis.

Liquid
Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC–MS/MS)
Analysis
LC–MS/MS analyses were performed on a Q Exactive
plus mass spectrometer operated with an Easy-nLC1000 system (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). Samples were reconstituted in 0.1%
formic acid and pressure-loaded onto a 360 μm outer diameter
× 75 μm inner diameter microcapillary precolumn packed
with Jupiter C18 (5 μm, 300 Å, Phenomenex), which was then
washed with 0.1% formic acid. The precolumn was connected to a 360
μm outer diameter × 50 μm inner diameter microcapillary
analytical column packed with the ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ (3 μm,
120 Å, Dr. Maisch) and equipped with an integrated electrospray
emitter tip. The spray voltage was set to 1.5 kV and the heated capillary
temperature to 250 °C. LC gradient elution was done at a flow
rate of 300 nL/min with a binary solvent system wherein solvent A
was 0.1% aqueous formic acid and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in
acetonitrile. The elution program was as follows: 0–15 min,
2% B; 35 min, 15% B; 40 min, 20% B; 50 min, 30% B; 55 min, 35% B;
59–65 min, 90% B; 80–85 min, 2% B. HCD MS/MS spectra
were recorded in the data-dependent mode using a “top 20”
method. MS1 spectra were measured with a resolution of 70 000,
an AGC target of 3 × 106, and a mass range from m/z 300 to 1800. HCD MS/MS spectra were
acquired with a resolution of 17 500, an AGC target of 2 ×
105, and normalized collision energy of 28. Peptide m/z that triggered MS/MS scans were dynamically
excluded from further MS/MS scans for 20 s.

MS Data Analysis: Identification
and Quantification
Raw data files were searched using the
TagRecon algorithm17 against a decoy protein
database consisting
of forward and reversed sequences from the human RefSeq database (version
20130621). Precursor ion mass tolerance was 0.01 Da and fragmentation
tolerance was 0.1 Da for the database search. The maximum number of
modifications allowed per peptide was three, as was the maximum number
of missed cleavages allowed. Different modifications of + 15.9949
Da (methionine oxidation), + 57.0214 Da (iodoacetamide alkylation),
+ 311.1845 (Azido-L-modification), and + 317.2046 (Azido-H-modification)
were searched as dynamic modifications. The maximum Q value of peptide-spectrum matches was set as 0.01 using IDPicker
3.0 software.18,19 Additional assessments were performed
as described in the main text, which results in a final false-positive
rate below 0.5%. Quantification of light/heavy ratios for tagged peptides
was performed using Skyline software as previously described.13,20 Quantification results were obtained from two or three biological
replicates with two technical replicate LC–MS/MS runs for each.

In-Gel Imaging and Immunoblotting
RKO cells were cultured
and treated with or without aHNE and lysed as described above. Cell
lysate (2 mg/mL) was incubated with 100 μM noncleavable azidobiotin16 or CruzFluor sm 6 azide (700 nm, Santa Cruz
Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA), 1 mM sodium ascorbate, 100 μM
TBTA, and 1 mM CuSO4 for 2 h in the dark at room temperature
with rotation. Reactions were quenched by boiling with LDS sample
buffer (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) for 10 min. The collected
proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and detected by either immunoblotting
with fluorescein-conjugated streptavidin (Alexa Fluor 680 nm, Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY) or direct in-gel imaging of fluorescein
conjugated adducts as indicated. Detection was performed with the
Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE).

Results
and Discussion
Strategy and Features of a Generalized, Quantitative
Chemoproteomic
Platform
We have adopted key features of our recently published
chemoproteomic method for site-specific mapping of protein S-sulfenylation
in cells,13 including site labeling with
an alkynyl probe, bioorthogonal conjugation with Az-UV-biotin, and
high resolution LC–MS/MS. However, our previous quantification
strategy relied on a stable isotope-labeled probe, the availability
of which may limit adoption of the approach. To overcome this problem,
we modified the Az-UV-biotin reagent to incorporate a light or heavy
(13C6) linker between the azide and benzoin
ester moiety to generate isotopically azido-tagged photocleavable
biotin reagents (Scheme 1). The mass difference
between these two reagents is 6 Da. Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information indicate that the reaction
efficiencies and the photorelease rates of these isotope-coded Az-UV-biotin
reagents are identical, which demonstrates that they can be utilized
to obtain accurate quantification results.

Our generalized,
site-centric quantitative chemoproteomic strategy (Figure 1) has five major steps (1) labeling or metabolic
incorporation of cells under different conditions with an alkyne tagged
probe, (2) digesting cell lysates into peptides with trypsin, (3)
conjugating the alkyne tagged peptides with light Az-UV-biotin or
heavy Az-UV-biotin via CuI-catalyzed azide–alkyne
cycloaddition reaction (Click chemistry),21 (4) enrichment of biotin-tagged tryptic peptides by streptavidin
capture and photorelease, (5) liquid chromatography–tandem
mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS)-based shotgun proteomics and informatics
analyses for peptide identification and quantification. The isotopic
signatures of light and heavy isotope-labeled peptides can be determined
by MS1 filtering as previously reported13 and we used both to minimize the false discovery rate in a large-scale
proteomic analyses and to quantitatively compare abundances of the
protein modification of interest between two conditions.

Figure 1 Schematic representation
of a site-centric quantitative chemoproteomic
workflow.

We verified the accuracy of this
strategy by mixing varying amounts
of light Az-UV-biotin and heavy Az-UV-biotin tagged proteomes in different
ratios (L/H = 1:4, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 4:1). The measured signals for labeled
cysteine containing peptides closely matched the predefined ratios
across all the quantifiable peptides (Figure 2). Moreover, the representative XIC chromatograms demonstrate the
coelution of the light and heavy species, the high signal-to-noise,
and the accuracy of quantification (Figure 3).

Figure 2 Validation of the accuracy of quantitative chemoproteomic analysis.
RKO proteomes were labeled with the alkyne tagged cysteine alkylating
reagent, IPM (Scheme 1), and digested into
tryptic peptides. Aliquots of peptide mixtures were conjugated with
light or heavy isotopic tagged Az-UV-biotin reagents and mixed in
predefined ratios (RL/H = 1:4, 1:2 1:1,
2:1, 4:1). After affinity capture and photorelease, the alkylated
peptides were analyzed by LC–MS/MS, and the light/heavy ratios
were calculated for IPM-modified cysteine containing peptides. The
distributions of these ratios demonstrate the accuracy of this quantitative
chemoproteomic workflow. Data are displayed using a log 2 scale on
the x axis.

peptides from five proteins at predefined ratios (L/H = 1:4, 1:2 1:1,
2:1, 4:1, from left to right). The profiles for light- and heavy-labeled
peptides are shown in red and blue, respectively. The peptide sequence,
modified sites (with asterisk), and charge status are shown above
the individual chromatograms. The measured light/heavy ratios (RL/H) are displayed below each individual chromatogram.

Proteome-Wide, Site-Specific
Analysis of Protein Alkylation
by aHNE in Cells
We performed an analysis of protein modification
by aHNE, which displays reactivity and cellular toxicity essentially
identical to HNE.16 RKO cells were treated
with 50 μM aHNE for 2 h, a dose and time point at which no toxicity
is observed. After tryptic digestion of cell lysates, aHNE-modified
peptides from two identical proteome samples were conjugated with
the light and heavy Az-UV-biotin reagents, respectively, and mixed
at a 1:1 ratio. The biotinylated peptides were captured with streptavidin
and tagged peptides corresponding to aHNE adducts were released by
photocleavage of the biotin linker. The released peptides then were
analyzed on a Q-Exactive Plus instrument with high-energy collisional
dissociation (HCD)-based MS/MS,22 allowing
for identification and quantification. The mass errors for the precursor
and fragment ions of modified peptides were within the range of 5
and 10 ppm, respectively (Figure S3 in the Supporting
Information). Because α,β-unsaturated aldehydes
are thought to predominately alkylate cysteines through Michael addition
in cells,12,23 we initially considered only cysteine modifications
as dynamic modifications during the database searching in our informatics
pipeline.24,25 We detected 457 distinct aHNE modified cysteine
containing peptides on 418 proteins with FDR less than 1% at both
the peptide and protein levels. As mentioned above, peptide aHNE adducts
covalently conjugated with light and heavy tags would yield an isotopic
signature that efficiently identifies these peptides in a complex
proteomic data set, thereby increasing the confidence of modified
peptide identifications. Thus, we recognized only those alkylated
peptide assignments whose MS1 data reflected a light/heavy ratio between
0.67 and 1.5. In addition, we found that the light and heavy modified
peptides produced diagnostic fragment ions (DFI) at m/z of 292.2 and 298.2, respectively, which reflects
characteristic fragmentation of the tagged Michael adducts.4 The modified peptides also tend to produce water-loss
fragment ions during HCD fragmentation. To ensure the accuracy of
site-localization, we utilized our previously reported protocol for
manual evaluation of all spectra of modified peptides.13 For example, we observed that aHNE selectively
modifies the Cys-73 of thioredoxin 1 (TXN1) in cells, as demonstrated
by the characteristic isotopic envelopes in the representative MS1
spectrum, the light to heavy ratio calculated from the XIC peaks,
and the fully annotated MS/MS spectrum with DFI generated from the
tagged peptides (Figure 4). In total,
we identified 386 aHNE-adducted cysteine sites on 335 proteins in
cells (Table S1 in the Supporting Information), which presents at least an order of magnitude increase of the
number of such modification sites previously known. In addition to
TXN1,26 several known protein targets of
HNE are also confirmed in this study, such as GCLM,11 GAPDH,27 ACTN1,28 and EFABP.29 Notably, our data
set also covers many “hot spot” cysteines for modification
by HNE on the proteins identified by Wang et al.,12 such as PHGDH Cys-369, RTN4 Cys-1101, REEP5 Cys-18, and
EEF2 Cys-41 (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information).

acid modified peptide from thioredoxin 1. Doubly charged monoisotopic
precursors of light and heavy labeled the peptide are observed at m/z 730.3588 (red) and 733.3686 (blue),
respectively, with mass errors less than 1.0 ppm. (B) XIC are shown
for changes in the same aHNE-modified peptides from thioredoxin with

respectively. (C) Characteristic fragmentation of the light-labeled
modified peptide and its HCD MS/MS spectrum. A zoom window displays
the diagnostic fragment ion (DFI) peak (m/z 292.2). The asterisks on the annotated ions indicate water
losses from the corresponding b- and y-ion fragments.

To determine whether aHNE reacts with nucleophilic
amino acids
other than cysteine in cells, we also specified histidine, arginine,
and lysine as variable modification sites for database search. Most
of the putative adducts identified in these searches were found to
be false positives after rigorous manual validation (data not shown).
Nonetheless, we identified 12 aHNE-alkylated histidine sites on 10
proteins, (Table S2 in the Supporting Information), whereas neither lysine nor arginine adducts were identified. Although
the number of noncysteine modifications was relatively small, several
were interesting. For example, aHNE selectively modified His-442 rather
than several known redox-sensitive cysteines on HSP90AB1 (heat shock
protein HSP 90-beta) in situ (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information), which confirms our previous
finding.30 Similarly, His-211 and His-300
were detected as the aHNE-adducted sites on the ALDOA protein (Figure
S5 in the Supporting Information).

GO classification using NetGestalt31 revealed
that 344 aHNE-alkylated proteins identified in this study
included targets in all major cellular compartments, including cytoplasm,
nucleolus, nucleoplasm, chromosome, and mitochondria. The adducted
proteins are involved in important biological processes, such as RNA
processing (p = 9.9 × 10–9), protein ubiquitination (p = 3.0 × 10–2), and cell cycle (p = 3.2 ×
10–2). The molecular function most significantly
enriched for aHNE protein targets is RNA binding (p = 4.2 × 10–11). This observation is in accord
with our previous findings5,32,33 and demonstrates with peptide sequence-level adduction data that
aHNE preferentially targets RNA splicing-related networks.

To
explore structural features associated with HNE-mediated protein
alkylation, we examined flanking sequences of aHNE-alkylated cysteine
or histidine residues with the pLogo algorithm for the presence of
linear motifs.34 Interestingly, lysine
was significantly overrepresented at the +4 position in aHNE-alkylated
cysteine sequences, whereas aHNE targeted histidine sites do not conform
to a sequence motif (p < 0.05, Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). Indeed, the positively
charged lysine is able to lower the cysteine pKa at an adjacent position and to facilitate cysteine S-alkylation
by electrophilic chemicals.35,36 We also found that
cysteine is underrepresented in consensus flanking sequences of protein
S-alkylation by aHNE (Figure S6 in the Supporting
Information), which is a common feature for most post-translational
modifications on cysteine.13

Direct Proteomic
Quantification of Dynamic Protein Alkylation
by aHNE
Although protein alkylation by electrophilic α,β-unsaturated
carbonyl compounds (i.e., Michael addition) is generally thought to
be a stable covalent modification, there is evidence that the reaction
may be reversible in certain cellular contexts.15,37 Our chemoproteomics platform provided an opportunity to further
examine the global stability of LDE protein alkylation in cells (Figure
S7 in the Supporting Information). We first
labeled cells with aHNE for 2 h and then replaced the labeling medium
with aHNE-free medium for another 1 and 4 h recovery period, respectively.
The cell lysates from 2 h of aHNE treatment without recovery were
used as controls and were labeled with the heavy Az-UV-biotin reagent,
whereas the samples from 1- and 4 h recovery experiments were labeled
with the light Az-UV-biotin. Analysis of aHNE adducts revealed a surprisingly
high degree of adduct loss at 1 and 4 h of recovery (Figure S8 in
the Supporting Information). In total,
∼87% of quantifiable aHNE alkylating events showed at least
a 2-fold decrease over the course of 4 h (R4h < 0.5). Nevertheless, as can be seen from the
heatmaps (Figure 5A for cysteine adduction
and Figure S9 in the Supporting Information for histidine adduction), several individual aHNE alkylations were
quite stable. For example, the measured light to heavy ratios for
EDC4 Cys-976 from controls and the 1- and 4 h recovery experiments
were 1.5, 1.5, and 1.7, respectively (Table S1 in the Supporting Information), which suggests this
alkylation event is almost unchanged during the recovery period. Notably,
of four cysteine residues modified by aHNE on FAM120A, Cys-919, Cys-1088,
and Cys-1103 showed dramatic decreases in S-alkylation after 1–4
h recovery periods, whereas S-alkylation on Cys-531 remained almost
unchanged (Figure 5B). This finding suggests
that the site-specific aHNE alkylation dynamics in cells is mediated
by some unknown repair or reversion processes, rather than by global
protein degradation. In accordance with this hypothesis, we found
that the turnover of aHNE-protein adducts in cells was not affected
by coincubation with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Figure 5C and Figure S10 in the Supporting
Information).

Figure 5 Dynamics of protein S-alkylation by aHNE in RKO cells.
(A) Heatmap
of ratios of changes of all detected cysteine S-alkylation events
shows that most adducts turn over rapidly in a time-dependent manner
in cells. Lower the measured ratio (L/H) indicates more rapid turnover.
(B) XIC are shown for changes in S-alkylated peptides from FAM120A
protein in RKO cells, with the profiles for light- and heavy- labeled
peptides in red and blue, respectively. The mean measured ratios were
calculated from three biological replicate experiments and are displayed
below the individual chromatograms, respectively. (C) Turnover of
alkylation is not affected by proteasome inhibition. RKO cells were
pretreated with (red) or without MG132 (black), followed by aHNE treatment
with or without 1 and 4 h recovery periods. Proteins alkylated by
aHNE were labeled with azido-biotin and detected by Western blotting
with fluorescein-conjugated streptavidin. Data were presented as mean
values ± SD, n = 3 biological replicates per
group. A representative Western blot is shown in Figure S10 in the Supporting Information. (D) Distributions of
the measured ratios of dynamic aHNE-cysteine adduction in
vitro (red) and in situ (white).

We next tested the role of an intact cellular environment
in aHNE
alkylation turnover. After 2 h of treatment of aHNE, we lysed the
cells and incubated the lysates at 37 °C for 4 h. We labeled
aHNE-modified proteins by Click chemistry conjugation with an azido
reagent with a fluorescent reporter tag followed by in gel visualization
(Figure S11 in the Supporting Information). A 4 h recovery in the lysate led to relatively little change in
the signals for alkylated proteins, in contrast to the 4 h recovery
in intact cells, which led to a dramatic decrease in adducted protein
signals. We enriched alkylated peptides from the lysate and intact
cell recovery experiments, digested the proteins and quantified adducted
peptides by light/heavy Az-UV-biotin labeling and LC–MS/MS
(Table S3 in the Supporting Information). Approximately 43% of the alkylation events on cysteines did not
change significantly (R > 0.67) over the course
of
4 h in lysates. On the other hand, 98% of these alkylation events
were decreased in intact cells. We plotted the probability distributions
for measured ratios of dynamic aHNE-cysteine alkylation in lysates
and in intact cells (Figure 5D). Our analyses
found that aHNE-histidine adducts exhibited comparable instability
in intact cells but not in lysates (data not shown).

These results
indicate that most aHNE-protein adducts are unstable
in intact cells, but that adduct stability appears to be highly site-selective.
In contrast, the same adducts are relatively stable in lysates from
the same cells. The results suggest that aHNE adduct instability is
mediated by factors present in intact, metabolically competent cells
and is not due to simple chemical instability.

Conclusion
We have developed a quantitative chemoproteomics analysis platform
that employs a novel, isotope-labeled Az-UV-biotin reagent. This method
afforded the first site specific adduct inventory and quantification
of protein alkylation by a lipid electrophile probe, aHNE, in intact
cells. The analyses generated ∼400 protein alkylation sites
on cysteine and histidine residues and revealed a characteristic sequence
motif of CxxxK for aHNE S-alkylation. A key finding of this study
is that protein alkylation by LDE is highly dynamic in intact cells
and that adduct turnover rates vary in a site-specific manner. Further
study of protein-electrophile adduct dynamics could provide new insights
into mechanisms of toxicity involving covalent modification. The quantitative
chemoproteomics strategy we describe provides a broadly applicable
approach to a site-specific map and quantify probe-modified and bioorthogonally
engineered post-translational modifications in an unbiased manner.
