Identification
of unknown peaks in gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
(GC/MS)-based discovery metabolomics is challenging, and remains necessary
to permit discovery of novel or unexpected metabolites that may elucidate
disease processes and/or further our understanding of how genotypes
relate to phenotypes. Here, we introduce two new technologies and
an analytical workflow that can facilitate the identification of unknown
peaks. First, we report on a GC/Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer
that provides high mass accuracy, high resolution, and high sensitivity
analyte detection. Second, with an “intelligent” data-dependent
algorithm, termed molecular-ion directed acquisition (MIDA), we maximize
the information content generated from unsupervised tandem MS (MS/MS)
and selected ion monitoring (SIM) by directing the MS to target the
ions of greatest information content, that is, the most-intact ionic
species. We combine these technologies with 13C- and 15N-metabolic labeling, multiple derivatization and ionization
types, and heuristic filtering of candidate elemental compositions
to achieve (1) MS/MS spectra of nearly all intact ion species for
structural elucidation, (2) knowledge of carbon and nitrogen atom
content for every ion in MS and MS/MS spectra, (3) relative quantification
between alternatively labeled samples, and (4) unambiguous annotation
of elemental composition.

==== Body
The overarching
goal of metabolomics
is to characterize all low-molecular-weight metabolites present in
a biological system. Approaches for mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics
can be of two varieties: targeted and discovery. Targeted approaches
permit absolute quantification of a limited set of known metabolites
using internal reference standards, which simultaneously confirm endogenous
metabolite identity. Discovery approaches attempt comprehensive analysis
of the metabolome through unbiased investigation.1 An advantage to the discovery approach is that it permits
detection of novel compounds, which could elucidate a link between
genotype and phenotype, thereby providing disease biomarkers.2 That said, interpretation of mass spectra without
a reference spectrum is not routine; despite their centrality to the
metabolomics experiment, spectral interpretation and identification
remain the most challenging aspects of the analysis.3

The challenges hampering spectral interpretation
and identification
in metabolomics are many fold. First, the targets of a metabolomic
analysis are often chemically indistinct from the reagents used to
prepare the metabolomic extract.4−6 Second, with gas chromatography
(GC)/MS multiple MS peaks per analyte may be present due to incomplete
derivatization. At the same time, there may be multiple analytes per
MS peak due to degradation and side reactions.4 In a typical GC/MS study, only 5–15% of mass spectral features
are assigned metabolomic identity.7 Identifying
the metabolic features is necessary, not only to improve analytical
depth8 and drive understanding of the metabolome,
but also to prevent erroneous biological conclusions based on nonmetabolic
signals.4 Third, even for features of metabolic
origin with quality mass spectra, true unknowns and novel derivatives
of known analytes cannot be annotated via database searching.9−12

In vivo stable isotope incorporation techniques
show promise in addressing many of these challenges.2 Several groups have recently used metabolic labeling with
stable isotopes (generally, 13C and 15N) in
discovery, mostly liquid chromatography (LC)/MS-based, studies.6,13−22 The stable isotope labeling (SIL) approach offers a means of discriminating
between true metabolite signals and spurious background.17−19 If MS/MS is employed, spectral interpretation and structural elucidation
is greatly aided by partial knowledge of the elemental formula of
each fragment ion. Lastly, SIL provides an internal standard for every
metabolite to assess recovery21 and provide
relative quantification.13,16,20,22

Another strategy to reduce
candidate elemental compositions is
through filtering using a set of heuristic rules developed by Kind
and Fiehn.11 The Seven Golden Rules apply
a number of chemical rules, elemental ratios, and elemental probabilities,
and evaluate the accuracy of the experimental mass isotopomer abundance
distribution.10 Together with a MS having
high mass and isotopomer ratio accuracy, these rules allow assignment
of the correct formula 98% of the time for compounds present in a
database.11

In this report, we introduce
two new technologies that hold promise
to further facilitate unambiguous assignment of elemental composition
in discovery, GC/MS-based metabolomic analyses. The first, our newly
introduced GC/Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (see accompanying
article23), enables highly flexible GC/MS
analysis with high mass accuracy, resolution, sensitivity, and scan
speed. The second, an “intelligent” data-dependent acquisition
paradigm for small molecule discovery, termed “molecular-ion
directed acquisition” or MIDA, maximizes the information content
from data-dependent MS/MS and SIM by directing the instrument to sample
the ions of greatest information content. Using polar metabolites
from Arabidopsis thaliana extracts as a model system,
we combine these two technologies with 13C- and 15N-in vivo metabolic labeling to enable MS and MS/MS-level
annotation and relative quantification, the use of multiple derivatization
and ionization conditions, and heuristic rules-based filtering of
molecular formulas. We demonstrate the unsupervised, consistent acquisition
of structurally rich MS/MS spectra for intact ion species from nearly
all MS features over multiple analyses, knowledge of the carbon and
nitrogen content in all MS and MS/MS peaks, and finally, unambiguous
assignment of elemental compositions for all queried features.

Experimental
Section
Molecular-Ion Directed Acquisition (MIDA)
The GC/Quadrupole-Orbitrap’s
Python-based firmware was modified to enable MIDA. Prior to an experiment,
the algorithm was informed by the user of (1) the ionization type
(methane positive chemical ionization (PCI) or electron ionization
(EI)), (2) the sample derivatization reagent (N-Methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) or N-tert-Butyldimethylsilyl-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA)), (3) the mass tolerance to be
used by the algorithm, (4) the minimum signal-to-noise of mass spectral
peaks to be considered as the initial peak in a spectral pattern,
(5) the member of the pattern to subsequently target by MS/MS or SIM,
(6) the number of targets per MS spectrum to target for MS/MS or SIM,
and (7) the duration of time to exclude targets from MS/MS or SIM
analysis. MIDA was developed for the following combinations of ionization
and derivatization: (1) methane PCI with tert-butyldimethylsilyl
(tBDMS) derivatization, (2) methane PCI with trimethylsilyl
(TMS) derivatization, and (3) EI with tBDMS derivatization.

Typical parameters employed for MIDA were as follows: mass tolerance
of ±10 ppm; minimum S/N of 100; [M + H]+ or [M – t-butyl]+ target ion for methane PCI and EI,
respectively; 1 target per MS spectrum; and no dynamic exclusion of
targets (0 s exclusion). MIDA MS/MS scans were acquired with an isolation
width of 5 Th, normalized collision energy of 25 eV, resolution of
17 500 fwhm, AGC target of 5 × 105, maximum
injection time of 100 ms, and scan range of 65–850 Th. MIDA
SIM scans used the same parameters as MS/MS scans except that the
isolation width was 20 Th in order to capture the entire isotopic
envelope of interest.

MIDA templates (vide infra) scored with empirically
developed relationships based on a dot-product of the m/z and intensity of each member of the template.
Heavily weighting in the m/z-domain
was necessary to promote the selection of the correct series of ions.
The scores for templates utilizing methane PCI and EI are given by
the following eqs 1 and 2: 1   2  where Ij and Mj are the
S/N and m/z, respectively, of the jth member of n total template members.

Data Analysis
Manual curation of chromatograms and
mass spectra, isotopic distribution simulations, and calculation of
elemental compositions were performed with Xcalibur Qual Browser 2.3.23
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Candidate elemental compositions
were generated within a mass tolerance of ±5–10 ppm using
the element constraints, C0–150H0–150O0–50N0–50S0–50P0–50Si0–10, and subsequently
filtered using the Seven Golden Rules11 program (available at http://fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/projects/Seven_Golden_Rules/), which was modified for tBDMS-derivatized compounds
when applicable. Isotopomer abundance error tolerance was set to 15%
if all three isotopes were present and higher if all isotopes were
not present. Filtering by the number of carbon and nitrogen present
was performed on the final list of candidates produced. To assess
the algorithm accuracy rate for determining the correct target ion
in a given spectrum, a set of 100 high-scoring spectra were manually
validated by two independent reviewers for confirmation that the correct
target was chosen.

Relative quantification of 13C14N/12C14N samples was performed on the
[M – t-butyl]+ (EI) or [M + H]+/[M – t-butyl]+ (CI) isotopomer
cluster(s) for 28 randomly selected compounds using a “consensus
spectrum” comprising the isotopomer intensities of each member
of the cluster, averaged over the first half of the peak elution profile
(to accommodate isotope swing24). The approximate
contribution of each species to the isotopomer cluster was determined
by the method of least-squares for overdetermined systems (Figure
S3 in the Supporting Information).25 Note, in this work, the straightforward use
of only the peak heights of the 12C- and 13C-
monoisotopic peaks for relative quantitation, as previously reported,16 was not possible for several reasons. Since
the incorporation of 13C in the Arabidopsis thaliana model was not 100%, every 13C14N-isotopomer
cluster was considered to possibly also contain species having 1 or
2 fewer 13C than the fully incorporated species; the contributions
of these species were summed to produce the full contribution of the 13C14N sample relative to the 12C14N sample and then normalized to the ratio obtained in the
1:1 mixture analysis for that compound. Additionally, since the native
metabolites in this study have only from 1 to 11 carbon atoms, a given 12C14N or 13C14N monoisotopic
peak might also contain contributions from other ions having 1 or
2 hydrogen atoms less (mostly applicable in CI). We have anticipated
in our analysis that the obtained ion clusters for each pair could
overlap and contain as many as five different ionic species in EI
and six different species in CI.

Further experimental details,
including sample preparation and
GC/MS conditions, are available in the Supporting
Information.

Results and Discussion
Molecular-Ion Directed
Acquisition (MIDA)
We report
here an “intelligent,” data-dependent acquisition (DDA)
method for directing real-time tandem MS events (MIDA). In traditional,
intensity-based DDA, an intensity filter is used to determine the
targets of subsequent MS/MS scans.3,26 In GC/MS,
where significant fragmentation occurs upon ionization, triggering
MS/MS events based on the most-intense species in the spectrum often
results in the fragmentation of low-m/z, low-information content ions. As a result, most of the use of MS/MS
in GC/MS analysis relies on targeted/scheduled methods, like selected
reaction monitoring (SRM), which are not amenable to discovery applications.3 To maximize the information content from MS/MS,3 the instrument should be directed to preferred
analytical targets, such as the molecular/pseudomolecular ion of each
analyte. The spectral processing algorithm employed by MIDA directs
the instrument to these ions by exploiting the expected adducts that
form during the methane PCI process, as well as the characteristic
fragmentation patterns of commonly employed derivatization reagents.
From these patterns of ions, we have developed templates collectively
comprising the mass differences resulting from fragmentation of, and
adduction to, the molecular ion species for the following combinations
of ionization and derivatization: (1) methane PCI with tBDMS derivatization, (2) methane PCI with TMS derivatization, and
(3) EI with tBDMS derivatization.

Members of
each MIDA template have a set mass difference from a “template
initiator” ion, the lowest m/z template member. To ensure the specificity of MIDA for its intended
target, most members of a template are required to be present. However,
since the analyte dictates the presence of certain ions, some template
members are optional; this ensures adequate sensitivity of the algorithm.
Any required template member can be targeted by the subsequent MS/MS
analysis. For the combination of methane PCI and tBDMS, for example, the template has five ions, three required ([M
– C4H9]+, [M – CH3]+, and [M + H]+), and two optional
([M + C2H5]+ and [M + C3H5]+). The initiator ion, [M – C4H9]+, and [M – CH3]+ (Δm = 42.04695 Da) correspond
to the loss of a t-butyl and methyl moiety, respectively,
from the tBDMS groups derivatizing the molecule.
The remaining three ions result from proton transfer and adduct formation
reactions during methane PCI, with mass differences from the initiator
of 58.07825, 86.10955, and 98.10955 Da. Since the two adduct ions
can be of low abundance or absent, they are optional in this template
(see Figure S1A in the Supporting Information).

Use of a template in the MIDA process is presented in the
following
example (see Figure S1B in the Supporting Information). Prior to the start of a GC/MS analysis, the user (1) selects the
template by specifying the ionization method and sample derivatization
type (e.g., PCI and tBDMS), (2) sets the member of
the template to target (e.g., [M – C4H9]+), and (3) establishes the mass error tolerance (e.g.,
±10 ppm) and S/N threshold (e.g., 100) to enforce for matching
the templates to the acquired MS spectra. Following the acquisition
of a MS spectrum, the on-board instrument computer “scans”
the MIDA template across the MS spectrum. At each potential “template
initiator” ion (any ion having S/N > 100), the spectrum
is
queried for m/z values falling within
±10 ppm of each template member. If all required members are
found, the template is considered “complete”, and a
dot product-based score is calculated based on the m/z and intensity of each template member. Next,
all “completed” templates for the MS spectrum are stratified
by score and m/z, and the user-specified
target member, i.e. [M – C4H9]+, of the highest-scoring template is then isolated and fragmented
by the instrument for the subsequent MS/MS spectrum. The instrument
then proceeds to target other templates, in order of decreasing score,
if multiple data-dependent events are specified, or acquires the next
MS spectrum. Because of the time constraints of gas chromatography,
as well as its high separation efficiency, a single MS/MS event (top
1) without any dynamic exclusion of previously selected ions was found
necessary. This process repeats throughout an analysis to yield MS
and MS/MS data for nearly all eluting analytes present in the sample,
with the targeted ion for each peak profiled over the entirety of
its elution (Figure S1C in the Supporting Information).

To assess the accuracy of this approach for directing MS/MS,
the
target selected by the MIDA algorithm was confirmed by manual annotation
of a set of 100 high-scoring spectra per analysis. For each template,
two separate researchers graded three analyses and the accuracy results
were averaged. This was necessary because only manual annotation is
possible in the absence of library reference spectra. Using this technique,
the MIDA algorithm had an accuracy rate of 93.6% and 91.3% for tBDMS derivatization with methane PCI and EI, respectively.
The accuracy rate fell slightly, to 88.3%, for TMS derivatization
with methane PCI.

An important consideration of any such “real-time”
algorithm is the amount of overhead, or interscan time, required for
execution. MIDA (utilizing 17 500 fwhm resolution for both
MS and MS/MS scans) proceeds at a rate of 9.3 Hz (108 ms per scan),
while regular DDA is approximately 16% faster, proceeding at 11 Hz
(91 ms per scan). As a point of reference, MS-only acquisition runs
at 13 Hz (77 ms), 16% and 28% faster than DDA and MIDA, respectively
(Figure S1D in the Supporting Information).

Further details of the MIDA algorithm along with the corresponding
pseudocode are available in the Supporting Information.

MIDA with Metabolic Labeling for Discovery Metabolomics and
Structural Elucidation
To assess the utility of MIDA, the
structural information gained by intelligent acquisition of MS/MS
spectra and the advantages of metabolic labeling for assigning elemental
compositions were combined to study polar metabolites from A. thaliana. Identical polar fraction extracts of A. thaliana grown under four metabolic labeling conditions
were analyzed: natural abundance (12C14N), 13C-enriched (13C14N), 15N-enriched
(12C15N), and both 13C- and 15N-enriched (13C15N). Following derivatization,
samples were analyzed using MS and MIDA-MS/MS, as depicted in Figure 1. Spectra from either MS or MIDA-MS/MS analysis
allow assignment of the number of nitrogens and carbons comprising
the underivatized molecule (Figure 1A). Using
MIDA-MS/MS, in Figure 1B,C, the algorithm’s
recognition of fragmentation/adduction patterns, rather than specific m/z or intensity values, permits the acquisition
of MS/MS spectra of the [M – CH3]+ of
each species in four separate analyses. Comparison of these MS/MS
spectra allows immediate assignment of the number of nitrogen and
carbon atoms present in each fragment ion. This information, along
with high mass accuracy m/z measurements,
can reduce the number of potential elemental composition candidates
for a given peak and facilitate its structural characterization, as
shown by the suggested structures for eight peaks in the spectrum
in Figure 1C.

Figure 1 Typical MIDA-MS/MS with metabolic labeling
data. (A) Partial MS
spectrum showing [M – t-butyl]+, [M – CH3]+, [M + H]+, and
methane PCI adduct ions (unlabeled) for asparagine – 3TBS under
four different metabolic labeling states. Comparison of the m/z shifts of similar ions between the
four states allows assignment of the number of carbons and nitrogens
in each ion. (B) Profiles of the MIDA-MS/MS of [M–CH3]+ over the entire elution profile of asparagine –
3TBS for all four labeling states. (C) MS/MS of asparagine –
3TBS [M–CH3]+ ion from all four labeling
states. Comparison of the m/z shifts
of similar ions between the four spectra allows assignment of the
number of carbon and nitrogen in each fragment ion. Above, structures
proposed using the knowledge of the number of carbons and nitrogens
(shown as red circles or red letters, respectively) for eight ions
in the MS/MS spectrum. The MS/MS spectrum confirms the structure of
asparagine – 3TBS.

The workflow illustrated in Figure 2 was
developed to generate unique elemental composition assignments and
tentative identifications for each putative metabolite. A list of
candidate elemental compositions within ±5 ppm of the MIDA-targeted
ion was generated using lax constraints on the number of allowable
carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon
atoms. This initial list was filtered for the presence of silicon
(required given the sample preparation and the templates used by the
MIDA algorithm) and then subjected to further attrition by the Seven
Golden Rules11 using a 15% isotopomer abundance
error (IAE) threshold. The heuristic filters employ the LEWIS and
SENIOR chemical rules, accuracy of isotopomer abundance patterns,
elemental ratios, elemental ratio probabilities, the presence of derivatizable
functional groups, and the presence of elemental formulas in the PubChem
database (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The resultant
list was filtered for compositions meeting the 15% IAE threshold,
and then each elemental composition was adjusted to be fully intact;
for example, in Figure 2 each remaining candidate
with less than 15% IAE was made “intact” by adding C4H8 to each formula (to account for the loss of t-butyl, less one hydrogen which was already added to neutralize
the initial ion). Thus, the composition C18H41NO4Si3 became C22H49NO4Si3. The intact candidates were then stripped of
their tBDMS groups to reveal a list of native (but
possible methoxyaminated) molecules (C22H49NO4Si3 with loss of 3 tBDMS became
C4H7NO4). After resubmission to the
Seven Golden Rules (with a 100% IAE threshold), the remaining elemental
compositions present in the PubChem database were filtered by the
number of carbon and nitrogen atoms known to be present from the spectral
data. If no matching compounds were found and methoxyamination was
suspected (note, the =N–O–CH3 moiety
added by methoxyamination did not contain 13C or 15N and, thus, was “invisible” by our metabolic labeling
method), the compounds were demethoxyaminated by subtraction of NCH3 and refiltered for nitrogen and carbon. The remaining candidate
was then confirmed by annotation of the associated MS/MS data.

Figure 2 Workflow for
spectral annotation and structural confirmation. From
top to bottom, first, the ion type selected by MIDA for MS/MS, the m/z, the abundance of the first–third
isotopomers, and the number of carbons and nitrogens present are noted
from the MS spectrum. Candidate formulas are then generated within
±5 ppm tolerance of the neutralized mass of the ion and filtered
for Si to result in a list of 21 formulas (out of 41). Candidates
are submitted for filtering by the Seven Golden Rules with a 15% isotopomer
abundance error (IAE) threshold. All 21 formulas meet the 15% threshold,
14 meet a 10% threshold, 7 at 5%, 3 at 2%, and 1 at 1%. All formulas
meeting the 15% threshold are made intact by addition of C4H8, a t-butyl group (shown in the second
level under the formulas meeting the 2% IAE threshold). Silylation
groups are removed from the intact formulas, as shown in the third
level under the formulas meeting the 2% IAE threshold. The desilylated
formulas are refiltered by the Seven Golden Rules. The six formulas
present in PubChem are further filtered by the number of nitrogen
and carbon present in the analyte (four carbons and one nitrogen)
to yield a single formula, C4H7NO4, which is confirmed using the MS/MS spectrum, and tentatively identified
as aspartate – 3TBS.

Using this strategy, we have made confident elemental composition
assignments and suggested plausible identifications for over 80 compounds,
some of which we successfully identified as artifacts of the analysis
(e.g., hydroxylamine and portions of the benzoic and carbonic acid
populations). Table 1 shows a selection of
the identified compounds from analyses using TMS derivatization and
methane PCI. The mean mass error for annotated mass spectral features
was 2.4 ppm (σ = 2.1 ppm, median = 2.5 ppm); the mean percent
error for isotopomer abundances (including, first, second, and third
isotopomer abundance errors) was 2.9% (σ = 2.9%, median = 1.7%)
(Figure S2A in the Supporting Information). While isotopomer abundance accuracy was reduced for low abundance
compounds, the mass errors were independent of abundance (Figure S2B
in the Supporting Information).

g Metabolites verified
with authentic
standards (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information).

Although the metabolic
labeling approach leaves little room for
ambiguity, 31 of the identified compounds were also subsequently validated
by comparison to an authentic reference standard (Table 1). Spectral and chromatographic comparisons between the confirmed
metabolites and standards are shown in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information. For all assignments but
three, knowledge of the number of nitrogens and carbons present in
the parent molecule permitted a unique result among compounds present
in the PubChem database. In the first of these cases, the two remaining
compositions for a derivatized [M–CH3]+ ion at m/z 348.14728, containing
5 carbon and 1 nitrogen atoms, were C5H9NO4, corresponding to amino acid glutamic acid, and C5HN, corresponding to 2,4-pentadiynenitrile, a compound thought to
be formed in the atmosphere of Saturn’s moon Titan or in the
interstellar medium.27 Occam’s razor,
the MS/MS spectrum, and the unlikelihood of 2,4-pentadiynenitrile’s
derivatization with four TMS groups make glutamic acid the clear choice
in this case of ambiguity. Similarly, in the second case, analysis
of several mass spectral features having a derivatized [M–CH3]+ ion at m/z 554.26355 containing 6 carbon and no nitrogen atoms resulted in
two compositions remaining after filtering, C6H12O6 – 5 TMS, 1 MOX (likely corresponding to several
isomers of glucose) and C6H4O2 –
6 TMS, 1 MOX, of which only the former was chemically possible. The
third case was similarly unambiguous: C6H10O4 – 3 TMS, an expected fragment of a di/trisaccharide,
following cleavage of the glycosidic bond, versus C6H2 – 4 TMS, which is not chemically possible.

The
success of the SIL strategy is mirrored by the results of the
only other study utilizing this technology to aid identification of
unknown spectral features in GC/MS-based metabolomics. Herebian and
colleagues22 studied the metabolome of Corynebacterium glutamicum, a species of bacteria used for
the industrial-scale production of glutamic acid,28 through both 13C and 15N metabolic
labeling. Using this strategy, they classified several compounds,
previously considered part of their C. glutamicum metabolite library, as artifacts introduced during sample preparation.
Additionally, several hitherto unidentified MS peaks were elucidated
using nitrogen and carbon atom counts, as well as knowledge of the
number of methoximes and TMS groups present. However, unlike in this
study where a unique elemental formula was obtained in nearly all
cases, Herebian et al. could not arrive at a unique result in several
cases.

Relative Quantification via Metabolic Labeling and MIDA-SIM
Besides attempting to catalog all components in a given sample,
metabolomic studies also aim to provide comparative analyses.2,29 With differential metabolic labeling, samples can be mixed and analyzed
simultaneously, and quantitative information on each analyte can be
gathered within the same analysis. This strategy obviates concerns
of incomparability due to variations in analysis conditions or instrument
performance between separate analyses. Additionally, it permits quantification
of numerous, natural-abundance samples against a common, metabolically
labeled sample, enabling large-scale relative quantification experiments.2

To establish feasibility, the 13C14N-labeled TBS-derivatized sample was serially diluted
into the 12C14N-labeled TBS-derivatized sample
at five different ratios (1:1, 2:1, 5:1, 10:1, and 20:1 12C14N/13C14N) and the mixes analyzed
with methane PCI and EI. For 28 compounds in each analysis, the 12C/13C ion pair cluster, corresponding to the [M–C4H9]+ of each compound, was manually
extracted. The method of least-squares for overdetermined systems25 was then employed to estimate the relative contribution
of each species present in the extracted ion cluster based on the
theoretical isotopomer abundance distributions for each species in
isolation (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). The results of this experiment under EI full-scan conditions are
shown in black in Figure 3 (for CI full-scan
data, see Figure S5A in the Supporting Information).

Figure 3 Relative quantification with MIDA-SIM. Accuracy and precision of
quantification for dilution of the 13C14N sample
into the 12C14N sample relative to a 1:1 mix.
Data from 28 features extracted from EI full scan or EI MIDA-triggered
SIM data are shown in black and red, respectively. The improvement
of S/N with use of MIDA-SIM enhances quantification accuracy and precision.
The target ratio at each dilution is denoted by a dotted gray line.

Note that with complex isotopic
clusters, knowledge of the elemental
formula is critical to performing relative quantitation. Determining
the contribution of each species in the cluster requires that the
theoretical isotopomer abundance distribution is known, which further
requires knowledge of the elemental composition of the peak. Given
that the 12C/13C pair also serves to assist
assignment of elemental composition by signifying the number of carbon
atoms present in the analyte, the two samples act as internal standards
for each other. This approach is unlikely to have the accuracy of
identification or quantification via an authentic internal reference
standard due to incomplete incorporation (see methods). With this
caveat, the data, while showing slight overestimation of mixing ratios
especially at large dilution ratios (i.e., 20:1), provide sufficient
accuracy and reproducibility to detect and estimate the relative abundance
of analytes between two samples.

The accuracy of relative quantitation
decreases with lower abundance
analytes as the dilution ratio increases30 (Figure S5B in the Supporting Information). In an analogous experiment, Giavalisco and colleagues16 demonstrated slightly better quantitative accuracy
and precision using liquid chromatography/Fourier transform ion cyclotron
resonance-mass spectrometry (LC/FTICR-MS)-based relative quantification
of various ratios of mixed 12C14N and 13C15N-labeled A. thaliana extracts. One
explanation for this discrepancy is that the abundance of the pseudomolecular
ion will have greater S/N when soft ionization techniques (electrospray
ionization (ESI)) are employed, which will yield better quantitative
accuracy. One method of increasing S/N is to selectively enrich the
population of interest in the gas-phase via selected ion monitoring
(SIM). Using a wide 20 Th isolation window to capture the entire 12C/13C ion pair cluster, we modified the MIDA algorithm
to trigger a SIM scan on the algorithm-selected [M–C4H9]+ ion rather than perform MS/MS. We first
quantified the S/N enhancement for isolated ions relative to the preceding
full scan, finding the average enhancement over ∼116k measurements
to be 1.8-fold (±3.4-fold). In accordance with our hypothesis,
relative quantification accuracy and precision also improved relative
to full-scan quantification, as seen in red in Figure 3. These data indicate that gas-phase enrichment through the
discovery MIDA-SIM approach can improve relative quantification by
reducing some of the bias resulting from insufficient analyte signal.
Furthermore, incorporation of a MIDA-SIM scan into the MIDA-MS/MS
workflow described above ensures high-quality data for both identification
and relative quantification purposes for nearly all analytes across
multiple samples.

Conclusion
Because of the chemical
diversity represented by the metabolome,
unknown peak annotation and subsequent structural elucidation in discovery
GC/MS-based metabolomics remain intractable issues. According to Fiehn,
these gaps must be bridged if GC/MS is to realize its full potential
within the metabolomics toolbox.31 Herein,
we have detailed the development and use of two technologies and an
analysis workflow that help to address this need. Our newly introduced
GC/Quadrupole-Orbitrap MS23 provides high
resolution, mass accuracy, and sensitivity MS data that permit the
reliable use of strict filters for candidate elemental formulas. Additionally,
stable-isotope labeling, in conjunction with our molecular-ion directed
acquisition (MIDA) approach for MS/MS, guarantees not only information-rich
MS/MS spectra for intact, or nearly intact, ionic species but also
immediate readout of the number of carbon and nitrogen atoms present
in each precursor and product ion species. Taken together, these data-driven
approaches permit unambiguous assignment of elemental composition
to all queried MS features in this study. While we did not employ
the standard methods of chromatographic deconvolution, retention index
correlation, and spectral database searching, our technology and analysis
workflow are complementary to all existing approaches and can be easily
incorporated into any standard workflow to further advance the tools
available to the GC/MS-based discovery metabolomics community.
