Matrix-enhanced
secondary ion mass spectrometry (ME-SIMS) has overcome
one of the biggest disadvantages of SIMS analysis by providing the
ability to detect intact biomolecules at high spatial resolution.
By increasing ionization efficiency and minimizing primary ion beam-induced
fragmentation of analytes, ME-SIMS has proven useful for detection
of numerous biorelevant species, now including peptides. We report
here the first demonstration of tandem ME-SIMS for de novo sequencing
of endogenous neuropeptides from tissue in situ (i.e., rat pituitary
gland). The peptide ions were isolated for tandem MS analysis using
a 1 Da mass isolation window, followed by collision-induced dissociation
(CID) at 1.5 keV in a collision cell filled with argon gas, for confident
identification of the detected peptide. Using this method, neuropeptides
up to m/z 2000 were detected and
sequenced from the posterior lobe of the rat pituitary gland. These
results demonstrate the potential for ME-SIMS tandem MS development
in bottom-up proteomics imaging at high-spatial resolution.

==== Body
Secondary
ion mass spectrometry
(SIMS), one of the oldest MSI techniques, has become increasing popular
for the analysis of biologically relevant samples, due in part to
its capacity to obtain chemical and spatial information at unmatched
lateral resolutions. SIMS ability to spatially resolve analytes at
such fine lateral resolution is enabled using ion beams that can be
focused down to the nanometer scale, which facilitates desorption
and ionization of surface molecules at such spatial scales accordingly.
This spatial resolution is superior to diffraction limited laser-based
MS approaches, such as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
(MALDI). However, the excessive energy of the primary ions limits
the method to the detection of elements, fragmented molecules, and
small (≤m/z 1000) intact
molecular species for nearly all practical purposes.1,2 Consequently, SIMS is restricted in its ability to ionize and detect
large intact molecular species, such as peptides and proteins, with
high sensitivity.

Matrix-enhanced secondary ion mass spectrometry
(ME-SIMS) has demonstrated
an increase in the ionization efficiency of intact molecules such
as lipids and peptides. Last year marked the 20th anniversary of the
first ME-SIMS experiment performed by Wu and Odom3 showing the ability to detect protein species up to 10
kDa. The SIMS community explored the ionization efficiency and mechanisms
of different organic matrices commonly used for MALDI analysis,4,5 reactive matrices,6 and ionic liquid
matrices7,8 in SIMS-based endeavors. In the past, the
use of ME-SIMS was limited to standards and extracts due to distortion
of spatial resolution and delocalization of analytes caused by the
typical techniques used for matrix application. Specifically, the
crystal size of the matrix ultimately dictates the maximum attainable
lateral resolution, as analyte migration from the sample’s
surface occurs over such area during the analyte extraction and matrix
crystal formation. In other words, if the matrix application creates
large, inhomogeneous crystalline structures, then the ability to confidently
localize an analyte within an area is diminished. New advances in
sample preparation techniques, such as sublimation devices and automated
spray systems, allow researchers to control the homogeneity of the
matrix and crystal size and minimize the delocalization of molecular
species.

Time-of-flight (TOF) analyzers typically lack sufficient
mass resolution
or capabilities to separate and identify isobaric species. Instrument
innovations, such as the introduction of a parallel imaging tandem
MS spectrometer on a TOF-SIMS platform,9 C60 source coupled to the FTICR spectrometer,10,11 and new hybrid SIMS system fused to an Orbitrap spectrometer, now
separate isobaric compounds and identify them at high spatial resolution.
These recent innovations enable new applications of high-resolution
SIMS in peptidomics and other fields.

Peptide sequencing has
been an unexplored domain in SIMS for two
reasons. First, only few tandem MS-enabled SIMS instruments were available.
Second, the desorption and ionization of intact peptide species directly
from tissue sections were near to impossible with conventional SIMS
approaches. Though a trivial matter in MALDI, where peptide sequencing
has been used to study various diseases, the extraction of peptide
species is limited in SIMS due to intense fragmentation caused by
energetic primary ion particles. Several sequencing attempts have
been made by looking at the fragmentation pattern in MS1 from digested proteins with12 or without13 prior liquid chromatography steps with LC-ME-SIMS.
A sequencing study of biodevices14 with
Ar clusters as “soft-ionization” source was limited
to the identification of a single peptide. Here, we show, using ME-SIMS
sample preparation and TOF-SIMS tandem MS, the capability of performing
peptide sequencing on extracted, intact endogenous peptides directly
from tissue and with limited spatial distortion and migration of analytes.
This experimental setup shows for the first time a new application
for peptidomics by SIMS tandem MS with the potential for high-resolution
imaging.

Experimental Section
Bruker Peptide Mix Standard Solutions
Solutions of
the Bruker peptide standard mix II (Bruker GmBH, Bremen, Germany)
consisting of Braydikine 1-7 (m/z 757), Angiotensin II (m/z 1046)
and I (m/z 1296), Substance P (m/z 1347), Bombesin (m/z 1619), ACTH clip 1-17 (m/z 2093), ACTH clip 18-39 (m/z 2465), and Somatostatin (m/z 2093)
were spotted on doped Si-wafers (Siltronix, Archamps, France) in 1:1
ratio of the peptide mix and 7 mg/mL α-ciano-4-hydroxycinammic
acid (CHCA, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in 50% acetonitrile
(ACN, Biosolve, Valkenswaard, Netherlands) and 1% trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The droplet was left
to dry prior to analysis.

Sample Preparation
Fresh frozen
pituitary glands from
Wistar HAN rats were sectioned with 12 μm thicknesses using
a cryo-microtome (HM525, MICROM, Walldorf Germany), thaw-mounted on
indium tin oxide (ITO) glass slides (Delta Technologies, Loveland,
CO, USA), and stored at −80 °C until further analysis.
Prior to analysis, the samples were consecutively dipped in iced-cold
CHCl3 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), MeOH (Biosolve,
Valkenswaard, Netherlands), and EtOH (Biosolve, Valkenswaard, Netherlands)
for 30 s, 30 s, and 1 min, respectively. Washed tissues were then
coated with CHCA (7 mg/mL 50% ACN, 0.2% TFA) using a TM-sprayer (HTX
technologies, Carrboro, NC, USA), using two passes at 80 °C,
0.1 mL/min flow rate, 10 psi spray pressure, 2 mm spray spacing, 1200
mm/min spray velocity, and 40 mm sprayer nozzle distance to sample.

SIMS Imaging
All TOF-SIMS tandem MS analyses were performed
using a PHI nanoTOF II instrument (Physical Electronics,
Chanhassen, MN, USA) with either a 60 keV Bi32+ or a 20 keV C60+ cluster ion gun for tandem
MS imaging experiments.9 The beam diameter
of the 20 keV C60+ was ∼5 μm measured
using a calibrated tuning grid. The analytical field-of-view (FOV)
was in 100 μm × 100 μm with 256 pixels × 256
pixels for Bruker peptide mix solutions, resulting in a 0.4 μm
pixel size, and 600 μm × 600 μm with 512 pixels ×
512 pixels for tissue imaging, resulting in a 1.2 μm pixel size.
The sample dose was in all cases at or below the static limit (1013 ions cm–2). The sample bias was set at
3 kV. The TOF-SIMS (MS1) and tandem MS (MS2)
data were collected simultaneously in positive ion polarity as described
in Fisher et al.9 The tandem MS experiments
were performed using 1.5 keV collision-induced dissociation (CID)
with Ar gas estimated to be 1 × 10–3 Pa in
the collision cell.9 In the course of each
acquisition, mass spectral information at each image pixel was collected
in the range of 0–3000 m/z and saved into a raw data stream file. The calibration was performed
on low mass identified peptide fragments.

Data Analysis
The images and spectral data were processed
using PHI SmartSoft-TOF and PHI TOF-DR (Physical Electronics, Chanhassen,
MN, USA) software. Except for intensity scaling and convolution, no
additional data processing was applied. The MS2 fragmentation
spectra were compared to the online sequence database Protein Prospector,15 and the fragments were putatively assigned accordingly.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) Imaging
After analysis,
the samples were analyzed using a 10-keV scanning electron microscope
(XL-30, Philips, The Netherlands) to determine the coverage and the
produced crystal size after matrix application. Sections were gold-coated
with the sputter coater (108 Auto, Cressington, UK), and images were
taken at 100× (Figure 1b), 8000× (Figure 1c), and 10 000× (Figure 1d) magnification.

of the matrix crystals were ∼2 μm on-tissue (c) and 0.5–1
μm off-tissue (d).

Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining
In order to identify
different features of the pituitary gland, the samples were stained
with the following H&E protocol: The section was consecutively
dipped in solutions of ethanol (100%, 96%, 96%, 70%, 70%, each for
3 min), in hematoxylin (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for 3 min, washed
for 3 min under running tap water, dipped in eosin (J.T. Baker, Center
Valley, PA, USA) for 30 s, washed for 1 min under warm tap water,
and dipped in 100% EtOH for 1 min. The dried images were optically
scanned with the MIRAX Desk Scanner (Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany) and
annotated accordingly (Figure 1a).

Results and Discussion
Peptide Sequencing on a
Standard
In order to evaluate
the peptide sequencing possibilities with the new parallel tandem
MS system, we first performed ME-SIMS experiments on a peptide standard
(a Bruker peptide mix II) comprised of Braydikine 1-7 (m/z 757), Angiotensin II (m/z 1046) and I (m/z 1296),
Substance P (m/z 1347), Bombesin
(m/z 1619), ACTH clip 1-17 (m/z 2093), ACTH clip 18-39 (m/z 2465), and Somatostatin (m/z 2093). Similar measurements, without tandem MS, were already
performed by Svara et al.6 to optimize
the extraction of peptides using different reactive matrices. In this
case, CHCA seemed to be the most promising matrix for peptide extraction.
CHCA causes peptide protonation, which increases the intact molecular
signal7 and is stable under high vacuum,
which makes it it a suitable candidate for ME-SIMS. The extracted
ME-SIMS peptide spectrum from the standard (Figure 2a) shows the presence of Bradykinin 1-7 (m/z 757), Angiotensin II (m/z 1046) and I (m/z 1296), and Substance P (m/z 1347)
with intensities up to 5000 counts. Higher mass peptides above m/z 2000 were not observed under these
conditions. The MS1 spectrum after the precursor mass selection
(in this case m/z 1046) with the
approximately 1 Da isolation window9 (Figure 2b) shows the advantage
of simultaneous collection of MS1 and MS2 spectra.The
biggest advantage is the fact that the MS1 information
is not discarded in the course of collecting the MS2 product
ion data.

range of 700–1700 acquired before the precursor ion selection

SIMS mass spectrum (MS1) of the Bruker peptide mix II acquired
with the [M + H]+ precursor ion selection of Angiotensin
II (m/z 1046). While the precursor
selection is monoisotopic, a range of approximately ±10 Da on
either side of the selection window is disturbed. (c) MS2 spectrum produced by CID and acquired simultaneously with spectrum
(b) of the [M + H]+ precursor of Angiotensin II (m/z 1046) with annotation of the major
a, b, and y fragment ions.

Every single intact peptide ion in the MS1 spectrum
was isolated and fragmented with high-energy CID. The fragmentation
spectra can be found in the Supporting Information. An example fragmentation spectrum of Angiotensin II (Figure 2c) shows substantial coverage
of the sequence by a, b, and y fragments. In comparison, the low-energy
CID of peptide precursor ions consist mainly of b and y fragments.16 The presence of additional fragments demonstrates
that ME-SIMS can be employed for peptide sequencing, and de novo identification
of each species delivers substantial sequence coverage.

Extraction
and Peptide Sequencing of Endogenous Neuropeptides
Directly from Pituitary Gland Tissue
Endogenous neuropeptides
are a complex set of messengers controlling a wide variety of regulatory
functions in the brain and the central nervous system. They have an
important role in many physiological and neurological disease-related
processes such as in Alzheimer’s and Usher’s diseases.17−21 These closely related neuropeptides are secreted by smaller organs
such as the hypothalamus and pituitary gland and often differ by only
a single amino acid. Within these small organs, it is important to
differentiate and localize endogenous neuropeptides on the cellular
level.

The pituitary gland is a small, neuropeptide-forming
and -secreting organ. Neuropeptides are formed in vivo by proteolytic
cleavage of proteins at specific cleavage sites and, then, subsequently
undergo a variety of posttranslational modifications to activate their
biological function. The pituitary gland consists of three different
regions formed of glial cells and nerve endings. Each of the areas
secretes different prohormones (such as OT_NPI, AVP_NPII, and POMC).
The endogenous peptides secreted by different areas of the pituitary
gland have already been intensively studied by MALDI-MSI,17−19 making it an ideal model for peptide sequencing and comparison with
ME-SIMS tandem MS analysis.

We carefully modified the sample
preparation protocol in an effort
to optimize the extraction of endogenous peptides. Sections were gently
washed prior to matrix application in order to remove the salts and
reduce the lipid content within the tissue. Only two layers of matrix
were applied on the tissue before analysis. The extracted peptides
(Figure 3a) are predominantly
found in the mass range of 900–2000 Da. A higher number of
spectral counts for the extracted peptides were observed in the posterior
lobe of the pituitary gland (Figure 3b), where OT_NPI cleaves into single peptide, oxytocin–neurophysin
I, and where AVP_NPII is viewed as the signal peptide, vasopressin–neurophysin
II–copeptin.18 The prohormone POMC
peptides secreted from the intermediate lobe are typically more acidic,
which is why they are more readily observed by MALDI imaging. In our
experiment, two of the POMC peptides were extracted and sequenced
from the tissue section. In addition, most of the Na/K cationized
peptides formed are known to be more difficult to fragment in CID.

Figure 3 (a) MS1ME-SIMS spectrum of extracted endogenous peptides
from the pituitary gland. The highlighted (blue) mass m/z 1949 was selected as the precursor ion. (b) H&E-stained
image (left) with annotated regions of the pituitary gland and an
overlaid SIMS image (right) of the TIC (red) and MS2 image
of the precursor ion (green). (c) MS2 spectrum produced
by CID of the [M + H]+ precursor of m/z 1949 with annotation of the major b and y fragment ions
and database identified as AVP_NPII copeptin fragment.

Several parent ions locally desorbed and ionized
from the smaller
area of the pituitary gland were subjected to tandem MS analysis to
determine their molecular identity (Table S1). For example, the MS2 spectrum of the extracted precursor
at m/z 1949 shows b and y fragments
with extensive sequence coverage (Figure 3c). We observed uniform sensitivity of sequence
fragments over the entire detected mass range, a benefit over using
conventional Fourier transform (FT)-based instrumentation, which can
restrict proper peptide identification.18 Using the Protein Prospector database, the extracted peptide was
identified as the AVP_NP II copeptin fragment. Some of the selected
precursor ions were detected as potassium adducts of the molecular
species, such as oxytocin (m/z =
1045 [M + K]+), resulting in a high intensity of the potassium
fragment ion, and thus limited our ability to properly identify the
peptide species (tandem MS spectrum can be found in Figure S1). Additional POMC precursor ion peptides were only
tentatively assigned to m/z 1686
and m/z 1884 due to a low coverage
of the sequence. The mass m/z 1686
most likely corresponds to a fragment of the joining peptide (J-peptide)
with identified fragments b5, b9, b16+H2O, and y16-NH3 (Figure S2). In the case of the m/z 1884 precursor ion, two different peptides
were potentially extracted from the imaged area. They could be assigned
to either the (POMC) J-peptide with identified fragments [MH –
NH3], b5-H2O, y7, y9, y16-NH3, and
x17 or the (POMC) CLIP peptide with identified fragments y3, y15,
y16, and b13-H2O (Figure S3).

Conclusion
In this work, we leveraged the advantages of
ME-SIMS, which affords
increased ionization efficiency and ease of detection of intact molecular
species in comparison to traditional SIMS methodologies. The capability
of performing parallel tandem MS analysis enables the detection and
de novo sequencing of endogenous peptides up to m/z 2000 directly from pituitary gland tissue sections.
The platform described demonstrates the ability to perform sequencing
without the need of prior chromatographic separation, while providing
uniform sensitivity of fragmented ions over the entire detected mass
range. We assigned endogenous peptides secreted from the posterior
lobe and also tentatively assigned peptide sequences to acidic POMC-cleaved
peptides, which are usually only observed with MALDI. In combination
with other MSI techniques, this method can elucidate the distribution
of endogenous and/or tryptically digested peptides for preclinical
studies with the potential for imaging at cellular length scales.
Our studies demonstrate that this method can be applied to study disease
pathogenesis, for which localization and identification of peptides
are needed at significantly greater spatial resolution than can be
provided by MALDI imaging.
