Cell membrane chromatography (CMC)
derived from pathological tissues
is ideal for screening specific components acting on specific diseases
from complex medicines owing to the maximum simulation of in vivo drug-receptor interactions. However, there are no
pathological tissue-derived CMC models that have ever been developed,
as well as no visualized affinity comparison of potential active components
between normal and pathological CMC columns. In this study, a novel
comparative normal/failing rat myocardium CMC analysis system based
on online column selection and comprehensive two-dimensional (2D)
chromatography/monolithic column/time-of-flight mass spectrometry
was developed for parallel comparison of the chromatographic behaviors
on both normal and pathological CMC columns, as well as rapid screening
of the specific therapeutic agents that counteract doxorubicin (DOX)-induced
heart failure from Acontium carmichaeli (Fuzi). In
total, 16 potential active alkaloid components with similar structures
in Fuzi were retained on both normal and failing myocardium CMC models.
Most of them had obvious decreases of affinities on failing myocardium
CMC compared with normal CMC model except for four components, talatizamine
(TALA), 14-acetyl-TALA, hetisine, and 14-benzoylneoline. One compound
TALA with the highest affinity was isolated for further in
vitro pharmacodynamic validation and target identification
to validate the screen results. Voltage-dependent K+ channel
was confirmed as a binding target of TALA and 14-acetyl-TALA with
high affinities. The online high throughput comparative CMC analysis
method is suitable for screening specific active components from herbal
medicines by increasing the specificity of screened results and can
also be applied to other biological chromatography models.

==== Body
As one of
the oldest materials
of traditional medicine practiced in the world, herbal medicines (HMs)
have a history of several thousand years. They are commonly composed
of one or several medicinal herbs following specific medical theoretical
guides. Their worldwide use has increased in recent decades.1,2 It has been generally acknowledged that the clinical efficacies
of HMs are derived from active components, while others may be useless
or even have adverse effects.3 Thus, the
confirmation of active components in HMs is of great significance
to ensure their quality and curative effects and also to elucidate
their complicated pharmacodynamic mechanisms.4 However, it is still difficult and time-consuming to recognize and
confirm active components with specific effects from hundreds of chemicals
even in a single herb.

Biological affinity chromatography combined
with advanced detectors
has the advantages of high throughput and good selectivity, which
is widely used for screening bioactive molecules from complex matrixes5−9 and also for studying binding interactions between molecules and
specific receptors.10−12 Cell membrane chromatography (CMC) is a well developed
biological chromatographic technique in which cell membranes containing
certain receptors are used as the stationary phase.13−15 This method
had been extensively reviewed.16,17 It is a practical method
for screening active components from complex HMs18−21 and also for investigating drug-receptor
interactions.22−24 In order to efficiently characterize and identify
the active ingredients that have an affinity to cell membrane stationary
phase (CMSP), several two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC)
methods have been established for rapid investigation of complex HMs.18,19,25−28 However, some problems remain:
(1) The CMC preparation procedures are time-consuming, especially
the membrane extraction steps, and some key parameters, e.g., content
of maximum binding protein, lack precise control. (2) Pathological
tissue-derived CMC models to screen specific active components against
the specific diseases from HMs have rarely been developed. (3) Using
one receptor highly expressing cell lines as cell membrane source
is a practical way to screen receptor’s agonists and antagonists,13,15,26 but this method neglects the
multitarget property of HMs and thus is insufficient in the comprehensive
characterization of active components in HMs. While other groups have
immobilized multiple membrane proteins of various tissues and cells11,26,29 and showed that these CMC models
could be used as a representation of the targeted family of receptors,
a comparison between normal and pathological states was not carried
out to selectively screen components of HMs which act on the specific
diseases.

Among all these cell membrane sources for CMC, the
pathological
tissues from human or animal after exposure to pathogenic factors
are the most ideal materials for screening components from HMs because
of the maximum simulation of in vivo drug-receptor
interactions. This method has rarely been applied, mainly because
of the difficulty of preparing pathological tissue derived CMC models
and technical limitations of large scale comparative CMC analysis
between normal and pathological CMC models. The comparison between
the two states using the CMC method does have its advantages, such
as characterization of specific components acting on pathological
membranes through comparative procedures and study of the variation
of target proteins between normal and pathological states using positive
drugs. Fortunately, owing to the development of column selection,30 peak aligning,31 and
data processing techniques,32 the comprehensive
2D-LC has gained increasing popularity as a technique because of its
powerful separation and analysis abilities with the integration of
orthogonal columns and advanced detectors.33,34 In our previous research, a comprehensive two-dimensional CMC system
was established for rapid screening of antitumor components from 28
HMs.21

Thus, in this study, a novel
strategy of comparative CMC analysis
based on column selection and comprehensive 2D-LC techniques was proposed
for reliable screening components acting on specific diseases from
complex HM samples. Cell membrane sources were derived from the left
ventricle of rat hearts. Normal hearts were compared with hearts that
were failing by pretreatment with doxorubicin (DOX), which has cumulative
and dose-dependent cardiotoxicity and has been used as an ideal modeling
drug for inducing acute or chronic cardiomyopathy in experimental
animals.35 The direct cardiomyocyte membrane
damage, reflected in impairing membrane integrity and stability responsible
for cell apoptosis and death, is one of the major causes of DOX-induced
heart failure.36,37 The function of multiple membrane
receptors is subsequently impaired.38,39Acontium
carmichaeli (Fuzi) is a famous herbal medicine and is widely
used as a therapeutic agent in East and Southeast Asia. Our group
has previously used Fuzi as a major ingredient in a herbal formula
for effective treatment of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy40 and myocardial infarction.41,42 However, the
definite active components in Fuzi related to its cardioprotective
effects are still ambiguous.

Therefore, the proposed comparative
CMC analysis method based on
the establishment of normal myocardium CMC (NM/CMC) and DOX-induced
failing myocardium CMC (FM/CMC) models was applied to screening specific
components of Fuzi that can counteract DOX-induced heart failure.
The methodology of this new system was elaborately investigated and
optimized to reproduce different batches. A series of validation experiments
including cell viability assay, competitive displacement assay, and
molecular docking modeling were conducted to confirm the cardioprotective
effects and binding targets of the screened active components. The
automated and high throughput comparative CMC analysis method is suitable
for screening active components from HMs on comparing their chromatographic
affinity behaviors between normal and pathological CMC columns.

Experimental
Section
Ethics Statement
All animal experiments were approved
by the Administrative Committee of Experimental Animal Care and Use
of Second Military Medical University (SCXK(Hu)2007-0005) and conformed
to the National Institute of Health guidelines on the ethical use
of animals.

Chemicals and Materials
Doxorubicin
hydrochloride,
tetracycline, dexamethasone, oxymetazoline, tamsulosin, benzoylaconitine,
and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) were purchased from the National Institute
for the Pharmaceutical and Biological Products of China (Beijing,
China), and the purities were all over 98%. 25 mg of talatizamine
(TALA) was isolated and purified from the roots of A. carmichaeli by the authors. The structure of TALA was unambiguously identified
by 1H NMR and MS spectra, and its purity was over 98% determined
by HPLC-UV. A. carmichaeli (collection in Sichuan,
China) were purchased from Shanghai Leiyunshang Medicine Corp. (Shanghai,
China). Rat cardiac H9c2 cell line was obtained from American Type
Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA). Dulbecco minimal essential
medium (DMEM) was purchased from Invitrogen Corporation (Grand Island,
NE, USA) and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FBS) obtained
from Gibco Co. (Rockville, MD, USA). Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), penicillin
streptomycin, and trypsin were purchased from Gibco Co. The silica
gel (5 μm, 200 Å) was obtained from Meigao Materials, Inc.
(Qingdao, China). HPLC-grade acetonitrile was purchased from Merck
Co. (Darmstadt, Germany). MS-grade ammonia acetate was obtained from
Sigma Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Ultrapure water was prepared with
a Milli-Q water purification system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).
Other reagents were of analytical grade.

Preparation of Sample and
Standard Solutions
The crude
drug of Fuzi (200 g) was immersed in 2.4 L of water for 1 h and then
decocted to boil for 2 h. The decoction was filtered through four
layers of gauze. Next, the dreg was boiled once again for 1 h with
2 L of water, and the decoction was filtrated out with the above method.
Afterward, the successive decoctions were merged and condensed by
a rotatory evaporator under reduced pressure. Finally, the Fuzi extraction
solution was made to a concentration of 1.0 g/mL (expressed as the
weight of crude drug). For CMC analysis, the extract was added with
4-fold volume of ethanol to precipitate the polysaccharide and protein.
After standing overnight, the supernatant was filtered and condensed
to 0.3 g crude drug/mL (the concentrations of main components were
more than 50 μM) for injection (5 μL). According to our
previous published papers,43 24 components
of Fuzi extract were successfully identified by HPLC-TOF/MS. A mixed
standards solution of oxymetazoline, nifedipine, and dexamethasone
(0.5 mM each) was prepared in 70% methanol. Doxorubicin hydrochloride
was immediately dissolved in ddH2O to make a 5 mM solution
before use. TALA was dissolved in 0.15% HCl (v/v) to make a 10 mM
stock solution. 4-AP was dissolved in 5 mM ammonia acetate or culture
medium before use.

Animal Experiments
All animal experiments
were performed
at the Centre of Laboratory Animals of the Second Military Medical
University (Shanghai, China) in accordance with the relevant national
legislation and local guidelines. Sprague-Dawley rats, 180–220
g weight, were purchased from the Shanghai Laboratory Animal Co. Mice
were housed in a temperature range from 20 to 25 °C and humidity
range from 50 to 60%. The rats were fed with commercial aseptic food
and tap water continuously available throughout the experimental period.
The animals were randomly divided into three groups (control, DOX,
and DOX plus Fuzi). For the DOX group (n = 9) and
DOX plus Fuzi group (n = 6), DOX was administered
intraperitoneally in six equal injections (each containing 2.5 mg/kg)
over a period of 2 weeks, with a total cumulative dosage of 15 mg/kg
body weight.44 The rats in the DOX plus
Fuzi group were treated with Fuzi extract 2 g/kg/BW i.p. for 14 consecutive
days after the first administration of DOX. The administration dose
in the current study is in accordance with clinical use and had been
confirmed to have no cardiotoxicity by our group.45 For the control group (n = 9), saline
(0.4 mL) was injected in the same manner. At day 15, after hemodynamics
assessments, the hearts of 3 rats in control and DOX groups, respectively,
were excised for preparation of CMC columns. The rest of the 6 rats
from each of the three groups were sacrificed, and their hearts were
rapidly excised and immersed in 10% formaldehyde for hematein-eosin
(HE) staining.

NM/CMC and FM/CMC Model
The rat
myocardium cell membrane
was prepared using our previous method with a few modifications.20,21 In brief, the heart of rats from the normal or DOX-treated group
was harvested immediately and the heart atrium was completely removed
except the left ventricle part. The cardiac muscular tissue was immerged
into precooled saline to wash out the blood. After cutting into pieces
in 10 mL of precooled normal saline, 200 mg of tissue was put into
a glass homogenizer for homogenizing. The homogenate was then centrifuged
at 3000g for 10 min, and 10 mL of phosphate buffered
solution (PBS, pH 7.4, 10 mM) was added to the pellet to produce a
cell suspension, which was ruptured on ice by an ultrasonic cell disruptor
(Scientz biotechnology co., Ningbo, China) at 400 W, 2 s, 5 times
with 20 s intervals. The resulting suspension was vortex-mixed and
clarified by centrifugation at 1000g for 10 min.
The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 12 000g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was collected and
washed with PBS and centrifuged at 12 000g for another 20 min. Then, 5 mL of saline was added to the pellet
and the myocardium cell membrane suspension was obtained. Cell membrane
stationary phase (CMSP) was prepared by the adsorption of cell membrane
suspension on silica (0.04 g, dried at 120 °C for 2 h before
use) under vacuum and agitation conditions at 4 °C. After standing
overnight, the myocardium CMSP was washed with 10 mL of PBS 3 times
and packed into a column (10 mm × 2 mm i.d.) using a wet packing
procedure.

Comprehensive Two-Dimensional Comparative
CMC System
The comprehensive 2D comparative CMC system was
composed of commercial
available modules. As shown in Figure 1, the
comprehensive 2D system was performed on an Agilent 1200 series HPLC
system consisting of unitary (Pump 1) and binary (Pump 2 and Pump
3) solvent delivery systems, a thermostatically controlled column
apartment, an online degasser, and an autosampler controlled by Agilent
MassHunter Workstation (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA).
In order to realize the synchronization of the two dimensions, the
proper configuration of parameters was determined by the aid of a
home-written program in Visual Basic 6.0 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA,
USA). CMC columns (n = 6) including both three normal
and pathological myocardium models were simultaneously equipped with
a position selection valve (Agilent 1100 series, G1159A) for rapid
comparative analysis. An electronically controlled 10-port dual-position
valve (MXP9960-000, Rheodyne, Rohnert park, CA, USA) equipped with
two 500 μL sampling loops was used as the interface between
the two dimensions. Each fraction from the first dimension (column
1) was stored in the parallel sampling loops and further introduced
in the second dimensional column alternatively every 2.5 min. In total,
12 fractions were collected, and thus, 30 min of the first dimension
was conducted for comprehensive two-dimensional analysis. The eluent
of the second dimensional column was introduced to a 6220 TOF mass
spectrometer (Agilent Technologies) equipped with an electrospray
ionization interface, and the signals were collected by the Agilent
MassHunter Workstation (Agilent Technologies). When the 12th fraction
of column 1 was being analyzed, the position selection valve was switched
to column 2 for the equilibrium procedure (Figure 1C).

Figure 1 Block scheme of 2D comparative CMC/monolithic column/TOFMS system.
The position selection valve is able to load 6 different columns (there
are only two columns displayed in the figure for brevity), and all
these modules are controlled by online software. (A) Ten-port dual
position valve was at position 1. CMC column 1 was equilibrated, and
the 1st fraction was collected in loop 1. (B) Ten-port dual position
valve was switched to position 2. The 1st fraction was being analyzed
by a monolithic column coupled with TOFMS while the 2nd fraction was
collected in loop 2. (C) When the 12th fraction of CMC column 1 was
being analyzed, the position selection valve was switched to the CMC
column 2 for equilibration and collection procedures.

Normal and failing myocardium CMC columns (10 mm
× 2 mm I.D.)
were applied as the first dimensional columns. The mobile phase was
5 mM ammonia acetate, and the flow rate was 0.2 mL/min. For the second
dimension separation, a Chromolith Performance RP-18e monolithic silica
column was used (100 mm × 4.6 mm I.D., Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).
Column temperature was 30 °C. The mobile phase was composed of
solvent A [0.1% formic acid (v/v)] and solvent B (acetonitrile) by
a linear gradient elution program as follows: 0–5 min, from
5% B to 25% B; 5–9 min, from 25% B to 75% B; 9–9.5 min,
from 75% B to 5% B; 9.5–10 min, 5% B. The flow rate was 3.5
mL/min. The eluent then was split, and 0.4 mL/min was introduced into
the TOFMS.

The TOFMS analysis was performed using our previous
conditions.21 The original data were exported
and imported
into MATLAB 7.10.0 (The MathWorks, Sherborn, MA, USA) to conduct baseline
correction and peak aligning and then transferred into the 3D plots
by a home-written program in MATLAB 7.10.0.

Molecular Docking Study
Molecular docking studies were
performed to explore the underlying mechanisms of myocardial protective
effect of TALA and other components. Docking calculations were carried
out using a Surflex-Dock GeomX module of Sybyl-X1.3.46 The crystal structure of K+ channel protein
was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with entry 1J95. The water molecules
and the complex inhibitor were removed, and hydrogen atoms were added.
The receptor and the ligand files were prepared by using our published
protocols.47,48 The flexible ligands were docked
to the rigid receptor protein using default settings for all parameters.

Competitive Displacement Assay
The competitive displacement
assay was conducted according to our previously reported method with
slight modifications.21 Briefly, one FM/CMC
column was equilibrated with 5 mM ammonium acetate until steady baseline
was obtained, and the retention time of TALA (10 mM, injection volume
1 μL) was recorded by TOFMS. Then, the CMC system was rebalanced
with the mobile phase containing 4-AP until the platform of each breakthrough
curve could be observed. Afterward, another injection of TALA was
performed. Totally, five concentrations of 4-AP in the mobile phase
(1, 2, 5, 10, and 25 μM) were tested for revealing the binding
target of TALA.

Results and Discussion
Cardioprotective Effect of Fuzi on DOX-Induced
Heart Failure
Although the pharmacological effects of Fuzi
on the cardiovascular
system were extensively reported,49 we
conducted further in vivo experiments to evaluate
the quality of DOX-induced heart failure models, in addition to the
cardioprotective effect of Fuzi extract. Table S-1, Supporting Information, shows the arterial pressure parameters
obtained from baroreflex sedated animals. Left ventricle end-diastolic
pressure (LVEDP) was significantly increased while left ventricle
systolic pressure (LVSP) and the maximum rate of pressure increase
(+ dP/dt max) were dramatically
decreased in DOX-treated rats compared with controls (p < 0.05). However, in Fuzi-treated rats, LVEDP was obviously decreased
and LVSP and + dP/dt max were increased
compared with the DOX group (p < 0.05). The pathological sections of left ventricle stained with HE indicated
that, after DOX modeling, the arrangement of cardiac muscle bundles
was disordered. The myocardial cells revealed impaired characteristics
including hemorrhage and necrosis. When treated with Fuzi extract,
these lesions could be obviously reversed (Figure S-1A–C, Supporting Information). These results clearly
demonstrated that the heart failure in rats was successfully induced
by cumulative injections of DOX. The pharmacodynamic effect of Fuzi
against DOX-induced heart failure was also confirmed. Therefore, the
pathological rat hearts were confirmed as ideal CMC tissue sources
for screening specific components from Fuzi extract that counteract
DOX-induced heart failure.

Optimization of Procedures for CMC Preparation
The
methodology of CMC was elaborately investigated and optimized for
construction of the pathological tissue-derived CMC model. According
to the previous research13 and our experiences,
the precise control of cell disruption and the content of maximum
binding protein on the column are the major influences on the quality
of CMC columns. In this study, an ultrasonic cell disruptor was applied
for rapid cell membrane collection. When the probe was directly put
in 10 mL of cell suspension or tissue homogenate and was run at 400
W, 2 s, 5 times with 20 s intervals, approximately 80% of the cells
could be observed to be broken, which was an ideal condition for coating
membrane on silica gel. Before immobilization, one fraction of collected
membrane protein was then absolutely lysed and precisely quantified
by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay reagent. The membrane suspension
was then adjusted to 0.60 ± 0.05 mg/mL, 5 mL/column, in order
to make an excess membrane suspension for reaching the maximum coating
content. After the immobilization procedure, the membrane proteins
were stripped from the silica by immersed in enhanced RIPA lysis buffer
and shaking for 45 min at 4 °C, and the content of maximum binding
protein on CMSP was precisely quantified as 0.31 ± 0.05 mg/0.04
g silica/column by the BCA protein assay, which can make a moderate
column pressure of 12–15 bar at the flow rate of 0.2 mL/min.
According to these parameters, the quality of each CMC column in this
research was well controlled and good reproducibility was obtained.

Suitability of the 2D Comparative CMC/Monolithic Column/TOFMS
System
As shown in Figure 1A–C,
six CMC columns including three NM and FM/CMC columns, respectively,
were simultaneously loaded in a 37 °C column oven through a position
selection valve with an alternative arrangement. After equilibrium
for 15 min, the first retention fraction recognized in the CMC column
1 was enriched into a 500 μL sample loop, and after the 10-port
valve switched, the enriched components were pumped into a monolithic
analytical column and TOFMS for qualitative analysis. At the same
time, the second retention fraction was collected into another sample
loop. Due to the poor separating capacity of the CMC column, it is
necessary to collect at least two fractions across a first dimension
peak for second dimension analysis in order to obtain reliable and
comprehensive results. Thus, the modulation period was set at 2.5
min for more accurate analysis and a total of 30 min; 12 fractions
of the first dimension were collected for comprehensive 2D analysis.
Considering the large trapped volume of each fraction (500 μL),
a high flow rate monolithic column (3500 μL/min) was applied
as the second dimension for rapid delivery and efficient separation
of fractions, and a precise split of 400 μL/min was introduced
into TOFMS for real-time accurate mass analysis. Other columns, such
as reverse-phase liquid chromatography, ultrapressure liquid chromatography,
and porous graphitic carbon column, were also investigated as the
second dimension, which could not achieve ideal results containing
good peak shapes with short analytical periods. When the last fraction
of CMC column 1 was being analyzed, the position selection valve was
switched to CMC column 2 for equilibration before the sample injection. All these procedures were
controlled by Agilent online acquisition and Rheodyne TitanMX control
software.

A mixed standard solution containing negative and
positive drugs was used to confirm the selectivity and reproducibility
of the myocardium 2D comparative NM/FM CMC analysis system. As shown
in Figure 2, dexamethasone (binding to intracellular
glucocorticoid receptor) was selected as the negative control drug,
which had little retention behavior. Oxymetazoline (α1-adrenergic
receptor agonist) and nifedipine (calcium channel blocker) were positive
control drugs acting on myocardial cell membrane receptors. From Figure 2A, we can see that nifedipine displayed affinity
on the NM/CMC columns while the affinity significantly decreased on
the FM/CMC columns (Figure 2B), which is in
accordance with the fact that calcium channel density is significantly
decreased in DOX-induced cardiomyopathy50 and other animal heart models.51 That
is the reason why calcium channel blockers had never been used to
treat chronic heart failure. In addition, the retention behavior of
oxymetazoline was not decreased in FM/CMC columns compared with NM/CMC
columns indicating the high activity of α1-adrenergic receptor
in heart failure tissue, reflecting on the adaptive roles in the heart
and protecting against the development of heart failure.52 On the other hand, in order to validate the
column to column reproducibility, the capacity factors of the three
standard drugs in the respective three NM and FM/CMC columns were
recorded and the relative standard derivations (RSDs) within groups
were all calculated to be less than 10%. These results indicated that
the proposed 2D comparative NM/FM CMC analysis system had good selectivity
and reproducibility for recognizing target components counteracting
heart failure.

Practical Application
The typical spectra of Fuzi extracts
obtained by independent analysis of NM/CMC-TOF/MS and monolithic column-TOF/MS
are shown in Figure S-2A,B, Supporting Information, respectively. When applying the online comparative 2D CMC system,
the direct recognition of the first dimension could be omitted and
the entire retention behaviors of all constituents in Fuzi extract
could be visually characterized by the 3D spectrum obtained from TOFMS
data (Figure 3). It is the first time both
normal and pathological CMC models were simultaneously loaded for
studying different chromatographic behaviors of potential active components.
Figure 3A,B shows the typical 3D spectra of
Fuzi acting on NM/CMC and FM/CMC models, respectively. A total of
16 components in Fuzi were observed as having retention properties
on both NM/CMC and FM/CMC models, which were unambiguously identified
by matching the accurate mass data obtained by TOFMS with our previous
reports (listed in Table 1).43 The chemical structures of 16 potential active components
were shown in Figure S-3, Supporting Information. In order to characterize the different retention behaviors of the
16 potential components between two myocardium CMC models, the capacity
factors (k) of each component on 6 different columns
were calculated by eq 1. The variation trends
of membrane affinity on different CMC columns are plotted in Figure 4. 1  where tR is the
retention time of retention component and t0 is the dead time determined by the nonretained compound.

a Retention time of CMC demonstrated
as time points of the start and the end of the elution curve.

b Peak that was not completely flushed
out by 1st-CMC column within 30 min.

From Figure 4, we can see that
most of the
components have less affinity on the FM/CMC model compared with the
NM/CMC model, including the three major alkaloids, benzoylmesaconine
(peak No. 10), benzoylaconitine (11), and benzoylhypaconitine (13)
in Fuzi. That was mainly due to the complicated cardiotoxicity mechanism
of DOX which results in the totally different membrane environments
of normal and pathological myocardium in vivo.53 By comparing the difference of affinity on the
NM/CMC and FM/CMC model, those components with good retention on NM/CMC,
but poorer on FM/CMC, should be considered as nonspecific components
for counteracting DOX-induced heart failure. Fewer efforts could be
devoted for their further pharmacodynamic validation. On the other
hand, those components with good affinity on both NM/CMC and FM/CMC
or even better retention on FM/CMC should receive more attention because
the high affinity on pathological cell membrane might indicate good
selectivity and efficacy. Thus, only four components, hetisine (3),
TALA (8), 14-acetyl-TALA (9), 14-benzoylneoline (15), which had high
affinities on both NM/CMC and FM/CMC (decrease of k values <3), were focused by the comparative 2D CMC system and
considered to counteract DOX-induced heart failure.

Effects on
H9c2 Cell Viability and Integrity of Membrane
TALA was isolated
from Fuzi for further pharmacodynamic validation
because it had the highest affinity on the NM/CMC and FM/CMC model
(k = 31.5–32.3) and was at a higher content
in Fuzi than three other potential active components (isolation still
in progress). DOX-induced H9c2 cell apoptosis and death is an ideal in vitro model for screening drugs that counteract heart
failure54 and studying the associations
of different molecular indicators.55 Rat
cardiac H9c2 cells were treated with TALA (1, 2, 5, 10, 20 μM)
in the absence of DOX for 24 h, and then, the rates of cell viability
were evaluated by CCK-8. As shown in Figure 5A, TALA at each of these concentrations alone had a slight promoting
proliferation but there were no significant differences from the control
group (p > 0.05). To analyze the effects of TALA
and benzoylaconitine on DOX-induced cytotoxicity in H9c2 cells, cell
viability was examined after incubation with TALA or benzoylacontine
in the presence of DOX (2 μM). TALA (2, 5, 10, 20 μM)
pretreatments provided good protective effects on DOX-mediated cell
death in a dose-dependent manner at low doses (p <
0.05, compared to DOX group), while benzoylacontine, a component with
good retention on NM/CMC but poor on FM/CMC, showed little protective
effects at the same concentrations of TALA (p >
0.05,
compared to DOX group). These results confirmed the cardioprotective
effect and noncytotoxicity of TALA in vitro and the
selectivity of the comparative 2D CMC system. The integrity of plasma
membranes was determined by monitoring the activity of cytoplasmic
enzyme LDH in the extracellular incubation medium, which represents
a common procedure to determine membrane leakage and cellular damage.
As shown in Figure 5B, compared with normal
cells, the released amount of LDH was increased when exposed to DOX.
Compared with the DOX group, TALA (5, 10 μM) significantly decreased
the amount of released LDH (p < 0.05). These results
suggest that TALA could prevent cardiomyocytes from DOX-induced toxicity
partly by the property of stabilizing cell membranes.

Figure 5 Effects of TALA on DOX-induced
injury in rat cardiac H9c2 cells.
(A) Cells were treated with TALA and benzolyaconitine (1, 2, 5, 10,
20 μM) for 2 h, followed by incubation with or without DOX for
24 h, and then the rates of cell viability were evaluated by CCK-8.
(B) H9c2 cells were treated with TALA (1, 2, 5, and 10 μM) for
2 h, followed by incubation with 2 μM DOX for another 24 h.
After collecting cell culture supernatants, extracellular LDH content
was measured using a rat LDH ELISA kit. All data were expressed as
means ± SEM (n = 3). ##p < 0.01 compared to the negative control group; *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 compared to DOX group.

Binding Target of TALA
and 14-Acetyl-TALA
Previous
researchers claimed that TALA is a selective voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channel blocker with high binding affinity,56,57 which may play a significant role in regulating the cardiac action
potential. We first ran 4-AP (a selective Kv channel blocker) on both
NM and FM CMC columns. Figure 6A shows that
4-AP has no significant change of activity in the FM/CMC model compared
with the NM/CMC model. This was in accordance to our Western blot
results of Kv 4.2, which is the major expressed subtype in the left
ventricle. Thus, the high affinities of TALA and 14-acetyl-TALA on
both NM and FM/CMC models can be explained. Next, a competitive displacement
assay was applied to confirm the affinity of TALA on Kv channels in
the FM/CMC model. As shown in Figure 6B, retentions
of TALA decreased with the increase of concentration of 4-AP in the
mobile phase, which indicated that TALA at least has one same binding
site with 4-AP. These two drugs were also run on activated silica
column alone, and no retention was observed.

Molecular docking study of TALA in the active site of K+ channel. Three-dimensional structure of the complex between TALA
and the binding site of K+ channel pore (PDB: 1J95). The TALA is separately
colored according to atom types (carbon, yellow; oxygen, red; nitrogen,
blue). The residues of binding sites of K+ channel that
interact with TALA are shown through hydrophobic interactions and
hydrogen bonds. Red dotted lines stand for hydrogen bonds, and key
residues are labeled in black.

To explore further the underlying mechanisms, docking studies
were
conducted to investigate the interaction of TALA and 14-acetyl-TALA,
two similar compounds in the significant activity counteracting DOX-induced
heart failure, with the crystal structure of Kv channel from Streptomyces lividans using Sybyl-X1.3. The docking results
were manually checked to ensure that the binding mode of the compound
had reasonable interaction and geometry fitting. The predicted interactions
between TALA and the binding site of Kv channel are shown in Figure 6C (14-acetyl-TALA in Figure S-4, Supporting Information). Residues Thr75 (chains: B and D),
Thr74 (chain: B and D), Ile100 (chain: B, C, and D), Phe103 (chains:
A and B), Gly104 (chains: B), and Thr107 (chain: A and D) form hydrophobic
cleft around TALA and 14-acetyl-TALA. The specific hydroxyl (−OH)
and methoxy (−OMe) groups of the two compounds show the hydrogen-bonding
interactions with the backbone of Ile100 (chain: A) and Thr107 (chain:
D), which were located in the selectivity filter of K+ channel.
In particular, Thr107 was also one of the binding sites of the selective
K+ channel blocker 4-AP.58 Recent
reports have suggested that the binding pocket and the pore region
of K+ channel consist of key residues (Thr, Ile, Gly, Phe,
and Ala), which form the selectivity filter of the K+ channel.59 Our docking results suggest that 14-acetyl-TALA
and TALA block the Kv channel by entering the selectivity filter to
suppress the K+ efflux, thus protecting myocardial cells
from apoptosis. Given the similar structure and chromatographic behaviors
of the two compounds, 14-acetyl-TALA (score 9.73) was screened as
a new selective Kv channel blocker with a higher affinity than TALA
(score 8.90).

Synergistic Effect with K+ Channel
Blocker
Blockade of sarcolemmal Kv channels can certainly
inhibit the apoptotic
volume decrease and attenuates apoptosis in many cell types, as in
a detailed review by Bortner and Cidlowski.60 As the K+ currents are up-regulated in failing ventricles,61 components with high affinity on failing heart
membrane might be good leading compounds for treatment of heart failure.
The 4-AP is a classical Kv channel blocker, often used for reducing
K+ current.62 The prevention
of cell apoptosis and death effect by 4-AP was also extensively studied
in many cell types, including myeloblastic leukemia cells,63 pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells,64 cerebellar granule neurons,65 and the rat cardiac H9c2 cell line.66 Except one same binding site, Thr107 (1J95 PDB structure) as
TALA, Ala 111 is a specific active binding site of 4-AP,58 which is located in the intracellular mouth
of K+ pores.67 In order to further
demonstrate the active binding sites and mechanism of TALA on preventing
DOX-induced cell apoptosis and death, the synergistic effect of TALA
added with the specific Kv channel blocker 4-AP was investigated by
flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis and death in FITC-Annexin V-PI
double stained H9c2 cells. As shown in Figure S-5, Supporting Information, when treated with 1 μM DOX for
24 h, 36.73% cells of late stages of apoptosis and death was observed.
The ratios of DOX-induced cell apoptosis and death can be reduced
to 19.92% and 24.70% by treatment with 10 μM TALA or 1 mM 4-AP,
respectively. When cotreated with the two drugs, only 14.52% apoptotic
and dead cells were observed, which indicated the significant synergistic
effect of TALA and 4-AP on prevention of DOX-induced H9c2 cell death.
These results confirm that the counteracting DOX-induced heart failure
effect of TALA partially relies on blocking Kv channels by binding
to different sites of 4-AP, which significantly regulate the loss
of intracellular potassium and cell shrinkage in response to regulatory
volume decrease, thereby preventing cell apoptosis.60 Because the alkaloids in Fuzi have the same parent nucleus
and similar structures, the blocking of Kv channels by Fuzi should
be one of the major contributors for its counteraction of DOX-induced
heart failure.

Concluding Remarks
We have demonstrated
the affinity comparison of major components
from Fuzi on normal and failing rat myocardium cell membrane using
an integrated column selection and online comprehensive 2D chromatography
analytical system for screening of specific components that counteract
DOX-induced heart failure. With a comprehensive methodological investigation
and optimization, the better quality and reproducibility of each CMC
column derived from normal or failing heart tissue were achieved for
large scale comparative analysis.
Four components were screened and considered as specific active components
that counteract DOX-induced heart failure. TALA, having the highest
affinity and content, was isolated for further in vitro pharmacodynamic validation to confirm the screen results. According
to assays on cell viability, the cardioprotective effect of TALA was
confirmed. In addition, Kv channel was successfully identified as
the high affinity drug target of TALA and 14-acetyl-TALA by the competitive
displacement assay and molecular docking calculation. Consequently, the active
components and cardiotonic mechanism of Fuzi were further understood.
The established 2D CMC analysis system for comparison of normal and
pathological models is suitable for efficiently screening active components
from HMs that act on specific diseases by increasing the specificity
of the screened results and saving a lot of labor on subsequent pharmacodynamic
validation.

In the present myocardium CMC model, hundreds of cell membrane
and plasma membrane receptors exist. By characterizing the complicated
interactions between multiple components and multiple receptors, the
proposed CMC analysis system can be applied as a preliminary screening
tool for discovering active leading components from HMs or other complex
medicine systems. It could also be applied for the determination of
the dissociation constant of analytes using the previous reported
multiple receptor CMSP method.29
