In
vitro selection technologies are important tools for identifying
high affinity peptides to proteins of broad medical and biological
interest. However, the technological advances that have made it possible
to generate long lists of candidate peptides have far outpaced our
ability to characterize the binding properties of individual peptides.
Here, we describe a low cost strategy to rapidly synthesize, purify,
screen, and characterize peptides for high binding affinity. Peptides
are assayed in a 96-well dot blot apparatus using membranes that enable
partitioning of bound and unbound peptide–protein complexes.
We have validated the binding affinity constants produced by this
method using known peptide ligands and applied this process to discover
five new peptides with nanomolar affinity to human α-thrombin.
Given the need for new analytical tools that can accelerate peptide
discovery and characterization, we feel that this approach would be
useful to a wide range of technologies that utilize high affinity
peptides.

In vitro selection technologies
have become indispensible tools for identifying high affinity peptides
to proteins of broad medical and biological interest.1 However, the technological advances that have made it possible
to generate long lists of candidate peptides have far outpaced our
ability to characterize the binding properties of individual peptides.
This disparity is due, in part, to recent advances in DNA sequencing
technology, which have made it possible to generate millions of peptide
sequences from a single in vitro selection experiment.2 Other factors that have contributed to the rise in peptide
sequence discovery include the use of bar coded libraries and liquid
handling robots in selection protocols.3

Countering these advances is the slow pace at which individual
peptides are characterized. In many cases, peptides identified by
in vitro selection are produced by solid-phase synthesis, purified
by HPLC chromatography, and assayed for function using analytical
techniques, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), that require
large amounts of highly pure peptide or protein. Because this process
is both time-consuming and costly, many researchers have turned to
column binding assays as a way to quickly screen in vitro selected
peptides for high affinity binding.4 Although
such assays are relatively easy to perform and use only small amounts
of peptide, the data produced is not quantitative. These assays also
suffer from high background and problems caused by differential peptide
expression, which can make it difficult to compare different peptides
analyzed in side-by-side assays.4b Even
when high affinity peptides are discovered, additional experiments
are needed to obtain quantitative metrics, such as equilibrium binding
affinity constants (Kd) that help describe
the physical properties of the peptide–protein interaction.

Recognizing the limitations of traditional methods, we sought to
develop a new analytical technique to identify high affinity peptides
from enriched pools of in vitro selected sequences. Our goal was to
develop a rapid and inexpensive method that would make it possible
to rank selected peptides based on their relative binding affinity
and, in a second step, determine the Kd value for the subset of high affinity ligands. The challenge was
to design a system that would require minimal amounts of peptide and
protein, was amenable to diverse protein classes, and allowed individual
assays to be performed in a parallel format.

We envisioned an
overall system in which peptides generated by
cell-free expression would be brought to equilibrium with their cognate
protein, and bound peptide–protein complexes would be separated
from the unbound peptide using a double-filter binding assay (Figure 1). We felt that this strategy has a number of key
advantages over existing methods. First, cell-free peptide synthesis
makes it possible to synthesize large numbers of different peptide
sequences in a fraction of the time that it would take to obtain the
same constructs by solid-phase synthesis (hours vs days).5 Second, peptides made by cell-free synthesis
can be engineered to carry a protein affinity tag, which allows for
purification by affinity chromatography. Third, peptides produced
by cell-free synthesis can be labeled with 35S-methionine,
a radioisotope that allows for accurate detection at low concentrations
without altering the physical properties of the peptide. Fourth, filter-binding
assays provide a useful method for determining Kd values, as binding can be measured across a range of protein
concentrations.6 Last, the entire process
can be performed in parallel, which makes it possible to simultaneously
analyze the binding properties of many different peptides.

Figure 1 General strategy
to identify and validate high affinity peptides
isolated by in vitro selection. (a) DNA sequences encoding peptides
with ligand binding affinity are inserted into a custom peptide expression
vector, expressed in a coupled cell-free transcription–translation
system as 35S-labeled peptides and purified by affinity
chromatography. (b) Peptides are equilibrated in solution with their
cognate protein target. (c) Bound and unbound peptides are separated
in a 96-well dot blot apparatus by passing the mixture through a two-membrane
system.

To test this strategy, we designed
a custom peptide expression
vector that would encode our peptide of interest followed by a TEV
protease cleavage site and the amino acid sequence for the streptavidin
binding peptide (SBP).7,8 We anticipated that the SBP tag
would provide a convenient positive control for subsequent binding
assays, since the SBP–streptavidin interaction is well-known.9 In our peptide expression assays, we found that
peptides generated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate could be purified
from the crude lysate by affinity capture on streptavidin-coated agarose
beads. We developed two elution strategies to recover the peptide
from the beads. The first strategy involved eluting the beads with
deionized water, which allowed us to obtain the peptide of interest
as an SBP fusion peptide for control assays with streptavidin. The
second strategy involved eluting the peptide of interest as a free
peptide by incubating the beads with TEV protease, which separated
the peptide of interest from the SBP portion of the fusion.

While the synthesis and purification of SBP-tagged peptides proceeded
without problem, developing a two-membrane system that could efficiently
partition bound peptide–protein complexes from the unbound
peptide proved more challenging. Although filter-binding assays represent
an established method for studying the binding properties of protein–DNA
interactions7,10 and more recently have been extended
to include protein–XNA complexes,11 such systems have not been developed for protein–peptide
interactions. This is presumably due to the fact that nitrocellulose
has a general nonspecific affinity for amino acids, which precludes
its ability to distinguish peptides from proteins.

To identify
a suitable membrane pair, we evaluated the binding
properties of several common laboratory membranes with different surface
compositions and pore sizes in a dot blot apparatus. We tested nitrocellulose,
PVDF, nylon, and cellulose membranes with various pore sizes. However,
reproducible results were only observed using a double filter membrane
setup with a top layer composed of regenerated cellulose and a bottom
layer composed of nylon. Using this membrane configuration, peptide–protein
complexes were retained on the top cellulose membrane and unbound
peptides that passed through the top membrane were captured on the
lower nylon membrane.

We tested the reproducibility of the cellulose–nylon
membrane
system by performing a 96-well dot-blot assay using SBP and streptavidin
to represent a model peptide–protein complex. In this binding
assay, SBP-tagged peptides labeled with 35S-methionine
were equilibrated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7) solutions
that either lack or contain streptavidin (50 nM). After 1 h of incubation
at 25 °C, the solutions were loaded into the dot blot apparatus
and passed through cellulose and nylon membranes. The membranes were
removed, dried, and quantified by phosphorimaging (Figure 2a). Analysis of the individual spots allowed us
to quantify the amount of SBP peptide present on the cellulose and
nylon membranes. We found that 89 ± 2% of the 35S-labeled
peptide was retained on the cellulose membrane when streptavidin was
present in the PBS buffer. By contrast, only 19 ± 6% of the 35S-labeled peptide remained on the cellulose membrane when
streptavidin is absent from the buffer. While some variability was
observed across the members, this result suggested to us that the
cellulose–nylon double-filter system should be sufficient to
distinguish the binding properties of different peptides.

unbound peptide–protein complexes. (a) Analysis of the streptavidin
binding peptide (SBP) on cellulose and nylon membranes in the absence
and presence of streptavidin protein. (b) Equilibrium dissociation
plot measuring the binding interaction of SBP with streptavidin.

For the cellulose–nylon
system to function as an accurate
predictor of peptide binding affinity, it was necessary to confirm
that equilibrium was maintained during the filtration step. If equilibrium
were disrupted as the peptide–protein complexes passed through
the membranes, then the observed binding values would underestimate
the true binding affinity of the peptide. To explore this possibility,
we measured the binding affinity constant of the SBP–streptavidin
interaction using the double-filter assay. SBP-tagged peptides labeled
with 35S-methionine were equilibrated for 1 h in PBS solutions
that contained a range of streptavidin protein concentrations. The
solutions were loaded into the dot blot apparatus and passed through
the cellulose–nylon membranes (Figure 2b). Analysis of the bound fraction at each SBP concentration yielded
a binding isotherm with a Kd of 2.3 ±
1 nM, which is consistent with the literature value of 2.4 nM.8 On the basis of this result, we concluded that
equilibrium is maintained for high affinity peptide–protein
complexes.

One of the problems facing those that attempt to
identify high
affinity peptides to proteins of medical or biological interest is
the challenge of distinguishing the highest affinity peptides from
a list of in vitro selected peptide sequences. In many cases, the
highest affinity peptides are not the most abundant sequences or even
the sequences that share a common motif.2 Recognizing this problem, we wondered if our cellulose–nylon
membrane system could be used to identify and characterize high affinity
peptides from a set of in vitro selected sequences. To explore this
possibility, we identified an mRNA display selection in which a random
library of 1011 different mRNA–peptide fusions was
used to isolate peptides that could bind to human α-thrombin.12 The authors reported 45 sequences that remained
in the pool after 10 successive rounds of in vitro selection and amplification.
Using a column binding assay, two peptides (T10.39 and T10.11) were
identified with high affinity to the protein target. Both peptides
were synthesized and tested for binding by surface plasmon resonance.
T10.39 was found to bind human α-thrombin with a Kd of 166 nM, while T10.11 bound with a Kd of 520 nM.12

Considering
the possibility that some high affinity peptides may
have been overlooked due to the limitations of the original column
binding assay, we decided to test 24 of the 45 sequences in our cellulose-nylon
membrane system. The set of 24 peptides were randomly chosen (Figure 3a), inserted into our custom peptide expression
vector, expressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate as 35S-labeled
peptide fusions, purified on streptavidin coated agarose beads, and
eluted by TEV protease cleavage of the fusion peptide. Three of the
peptides (T10.35, T10.46, and T10.57) did not express well and were
discarded. Coincidentally, these three peptides also have high hydrophic
values, indicating that our screen could be an indicator of peptide
solubility. The remaining peptides were each separately incubated
with 250 and 500 nM human α-thrombin for 1 h at room temperature
and analyzed in parallel by passing the solutions through the cellulose–nylon
membrane system. Control samples lacking thrombin were used to define
the level of background binding to the membrane and the fraction of
bound peptide was compared to T10.39, a high affinity thrombin-binding
peptide (Figure 3b).

thrombin-binding peptides. (a) A list

24 thrombin-binding peptides for affinity to human α-thrombin.
Stars indicate peptides with expression levels below the detection
limit for dot blot analysis. High affinity peptides are numbered in
blue. Arbitrary threshold (dashed blue line).

From our filter-binding assay, we discovered five previously
uncharacterized
sequences (T10.06, T10.13, T10.25, T10.30, and T10.37) that exhibit
at least 25% binding to human α-thrombin when the protein was
poised at a concentration of 250 nM. The remaining sequences showed
little or no binding, indicating that these sequences are all weak
affinity ligands. Of the high affinity peptides, three contain a conserved
DPGR motif that is found in T10.39, while the other two show no similarity
to T10.39 or each other. This could suggest the peptides bind different
sites on the surface of human α-thrombin, with the DPGR containing
peptides targeting the same epitope as T10.39 and the two unique peptides
binding elsewhere on the surface; however, further experiments are
needed to test this hypothesis.

Given the importance of human
α-thrombin as a potential therapeutic
target,13 we sought to determine the binding
affinity of the five novel thrombin-binding peptides. We began by
validating our filter-binding assay using peptide T10.39, which was
previously characterized and found to bind thrombin with a Kd of 166 nM.12 Peptide
T10.39 was expressed and purified as described above for the SBP peptide.
The peptide was then incubated with a range of thrombin concentrations,
and peptide–protein complexes were separated from the free
peptide by passing the solutions through the cellulose–nylon
membranes. Analysis of the binding isotherm revealed Kd of 170 ± 40 nM, which closely approximates the
known literature value (Figure 4a).12 Moreover, no difference was observed when the
T10.39 was measured as a free peptide or as an SBP fusion peptide
(data not shown).

Figure 4 Equilibrium dissociation plots measuring the binding affinity
for
six high affinity thrombin-binding peptides. Binding isotherms were
compared for peptides containing (a) and lacking (b) a conserved DPGR
motif.

Next, we measured the equilibrium
binding affinity of the five
uncharacterized peptides using the same methodology described above.
In each case, the peptides were expressed and purified as 35S-labeled free peptide by eluting the peptides from the beads with
TEV protease. The five peptides were incubated with a range of thrombin
concentrations and their Kd values were
determined by quantifying the amount of 35S-label on the
cellulose and nylon membranes. Peptides T10.25, T10.30, and T10.6,
which share the DPGR motif with T10.39, have Kd values of 200, 360, and 460 nM, respectively (Figure 4a). By contrast, peptides T10.13 and T10.37, which
are unique with respect to the T10.39 sequence, have Kd values of 160 and 310 nM, respectively (Figure 4b).

To further validate our results, we produced
peptides T10.13 and
T10.37 by solid-phase synthesis, purified both sequences by HPLC chromatography,
and confirmed their binding affinity by microscale thermophoresis
(Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). This technique measures changes in the hydration shell (due to
conformational changes) along a temperature gradient, which makes
it possible to determine Kd values using
minimal amounts of sample.14 We found that
peptides T10.13 and T10.37 bind thrombin with Kd values of 180 and 290 nM, which closely approximates the Kd values obtained using our double-filter binding
assay.

In addition, we also demonstrated that the high affinity
peptides
function in a complex biological medium. In this case, peptides T10.13
and T10.37 were conjugated to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and
used to recover recombinant human α-thrombin that had been doped
into HeLa cell lysate. After an incubation of 1 h at 25 °C, the
beads were precipitated, the supernatant was removed, and the beads
were washed with TBST buffer. The supernatant and bead samples were
analyzed by SDS acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both peptides pulled-down
human α-thrombin from the cell lysate with efficiencies similar
to peptide T10.39 and no contamination above the bead-only control
was observed (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information), demonstrating high affinity and high specificity binding.

The past few years have witnessed an explosion in the demand for
high-quality peptides that can be used to support a growing industry
of peptide-based therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Unlike antibodies,
peptides are amenable to chemical synthesis, generally nonimmunogenic,
and their small size allows them to penetrate further into soft tissue.15,16 These properties, along with improved strategies for increasing
serum stability, warrant new methods to streamline the peptide discovery
process.17 In line with these efforts,
we present a general approach for characterizing the binding properties
of in vitro selected peptides. This approach provides an inexpensive
method to synthesize, purify, screen, and characterize peptides for
high-affinity binding to their cognate protein target. We validated
the method using peptides with known protein-binding interactions
and applied the strategy to identify five new peptides that bind to
human α-thrombin with nanomolar affinity and high specificity.

In summary, we provide a new analytic technique to rapidly screen
and characterize in vitro selected peptides with high protein binding
affinity. We have successfully evaluated peptides that range in size
from 22 to 74 amino acids and exhibit binding affinity constants of
1–500 nM. While it is likely that subnanomolar binding affinities
could be measured using this approach, we suspect that weaker interactions
may not be possible due to long transit times through the membrane.
During the course of our study, we noticed that peptides that do not
express well by in vitro translation tend to have high hydrophobic
values, suggesting that peptide recovery after expression and purification
could be an indicator of peptide solubility. This observation could
provide a simple way to determine whether a peptide will be soluble
in an aqueous solution. Relative to more conventional analytical techniques,
like SPR or isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), the method presented
here allows for rapid screening of multiple peptide candidates in
small sample volumes using cell-free translated peptides that can
be obtained in a cost-effective manner. By contrast, SPR and ITC generally
require large amounts of purified peptide and/or protein that can
be cost prohibitive when screening large numbers of peptides. While
our approach is ideal for peptide screening and characterization,
high affinity ligands discovered using this method may require further
characterization in order to obtain a complete kinetic and thermodynamic
profile of the peptide–protein interaction. Recognizing the
advantages of small sample volumes, low cost, and high throughput,
we suggest that this strategy could be used to accelerate the pace
of peptide characterization and help advance the development of peptide-based
affinity reagents.19
