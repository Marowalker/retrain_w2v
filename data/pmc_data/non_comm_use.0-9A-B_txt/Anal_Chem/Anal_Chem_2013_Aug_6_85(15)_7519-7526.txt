Dual
carbon electrodes (DCEs) are quickly, easily, and cheaply
fabricated by depositing pyrolytic carbon into a quartz theta nanopipet.
The size of DCEs can be controlled by adjusting the pulling parameters
used to make the nanopipet. When operated in generation/collection
(G/C) mode, the small separation between the electrodes leads to reasonable
collection efficiencies of ca. 30%. A three-dimensional finite element
method (FEM) simulation is developed to predict the current response
of these electrodes as a means of estimating the probe geometry. Voltammetric
measurements at individual electrodes combined with generation/collection
measurements provide a reasonable guide to the electrode size. DCEs
are employed in a scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) configuration,
and their use for both approach curves and imaging is considered.
G/C approach curve measurements are shown to be particularly sensitive
to the nature of the substrate, with insulating surfaces leading to
enhanced collection efficiencies, whereas conducting surfaces lead
to a decrease of collection efficiency. As a proof-of-concept, DCEs
are further used to locally generate an artificial electron acceptor
and to follow the flux of this species and its reduced form during
photosynthesis at isolated thylakoid membranes. In addition, 2-dimensional
images of a single thylakoid membrane are reported and analyzed to
demonstrate the high sensitivity of G/C measurements to localized
surface processes. It is finally shown that individual nanometer-size
electrodes can be functionalized through the selective deposition
of platinum on one of the two electrodes in a DCE while leaving the
other one unmodified. This provides an indication of the future versatility
of this type of probe for nanoscale measurements and imaging.

==== Body
Ultramicroelectrodes
(UMEs)
offer high mass transport rates, low ohmic (IR) effects, low double
layer charging,1−3 and, as such, are optimal for many applications from
kinetic measurements to electrochemical imaging. UMEs serve as imaging
probes in scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), which has been
used widely to study the interfacial process at the microscale and
nanoscale, especially electrocatalysis4−6 and biological systems.7−12 However, the overwhelming majority of these systems use single electrode
probes and SECM can be productively extended to increasingly complex
and challenging systems through the use of dual-electrode probes.
In principle, such probes would allow two redox-active species to
be detected concurrently or would permit redox-active species to be
generated at one electrode and collected at the other electrode.13,14

Dual-electrode systems are widely used to study the kinetics
of
redox reactions.15,16 Usually, but not exclusively,17,32 such devices operate in an amperometric/voltammetric mode, where
each electrode is held at a potential to oxidize or reduce a target
species of interest, and the current measured at each electrode relates
to the flux of that active species, arriving at the electrode. In
generation/collection (G/C) mode, one electrode generates the species
of interest (oxidizes or reduces the analyte (A) to produce an active
species (S1)) that is then collected at the other electrode [via oxidation
or reduction to produce the starting material or another species (S2)]:    

The flux of active species generated
and collected depends on the
geometry of the dual-electrode system and the mass transport between
the electrodes. The G/C mode is often characterized by the collection
efficiency, which is defined as the ratio of the current measured
at the collector electrode to that measured at the generator electrode,
usually under steady-state conditions.

Dual electrode systems
that are constructed in a probe-type configuration
include ring-disk,18,19 dual-ring,20 and dual-disk21−24 geometries. Probe-based dual electrode systems have
been constructed using single and dual barrel (theta) borosilicate
and quartz pipets as a scaffold.21,25 However, collection
efficiencies for the majority of these systems have been low because
the interelectrode distance has often been large with respect to the
electrode size. A range of electrode sizes from 50 μm21 to nm23 have been
reported, but the wider adoption of these systems has been limited
due to difficulties in fabricating and characterizing the probes.

Herein, we present a quick and simple method for the fabrication
of probe-based dual carbon electrodes (DCEs). This method allows the
reproducible fabrication of a wide range of DCE sizes (from nanoscale
to microscale). DCEs are prepared from a laser-pulled quartz theta
pipet followed by pyrolytic carbon deposition. This is a development
of a recent method reported for making scanning ion conductance–scanning
electrochemical microscopy (SICM–SECM) probes.25 Pyrolytic deposition of carbon to form electrodes is a
popular method, employed to form several different SECM probes.20,26−28

Nanoscale DCEs are rather challenging to characterize
geometrically.29−31 As part of this study, we therefore developed a finite
element method
(FEM) simulation that allowed the effective geometry of individual
nanoscale probes to be estimated from single-barrel voltammetry and
G/C measurements. Furthermore, to demonstrate the suitability of these
probes for SECM and to provide further insight into the probe geometry,
approach curves, to insulating (inert) and conductive (active) surfaces,
were recorded in the probe G/C mode using intermittent contact-SECM
(IC-SECM).32−35

As a proof-of-concept, we used DCEs to study photosynthesis,
at
a film of isolated thylakoid membranes. In higher plants, thylakoid
membranes contain the light-dependent components of photosynthesis,
where light is absorbed and used to split water (at photosystem II).36 Electrons, produced from the splitting of water,
are transferred through the linear electron transport pathway before
being used to produce the energy-rich molecule, NADPH.36 Interestingly, a number of artificial electron
acceptors can intercept the electrons and be reduced by various components
of this thylakoid membrane-bound electron transport pathway.36,37 We use a DCE to locally generate an artificial electron acceptor
(oxidizing ferrocenylmethyl trimethylammonium, FcTMA+,
to produce FcTMA2+) and to monitor the local flux of both
species. The SECM platform also allowed us to construct two-dimensional
(2D) current images of a single thylakoid membrane, highlighting the
subtle interactions of a locally generated electron acceptor with
a dynamic biological membrane.

Finally, we show that individual
electrodes within a single probe
can be functionalized, through the selective deposition of platinum.
This demonstrates that DCEs could be used as a platform for a range
of chemical sensing applications in the future.

Experimental Section
Materials and reagents, together with details of the protocols
used to prepare thylakoid membranes, are detailed in sections S1–S3
of the Supporting Information.

Electrode Fabrication
DCEs were fabricated by adapting
the method previously described by Takahashi et al.25 Quartz theta pipets (o.d., 1.2 mm, i.d., 0.9 mm, Intracell)
were pulled using a laser puller (P-2000, Sutter Instruments); see
section S4 of the Supporting Information for pulling parameters. Butane was passed through the pulled pipet,
via tubing, under an argon atmosphere. The tip of the probe was heated
with a butane torch for 35 s, to pyrolytically deposit carbon from
the butane, as illustrated in Figure 1A. Electrical
contact to each electrode was established by inserting a copper wire
through the top end of the pipet barrel to make contact with the carbon
layers. A field-emission scanning electron micrograph (SEM) (Supra
55-VP, Zeiss) of a typical nanoscale DCE is shown in Figure 1B, and an optical image of a larger DCE is shown
in Figure 1C.

step of dual-electrode fabrication,
in which butane is passed through the pulled quartz theta pipet and

(B) SEM of a typical nanoscale DCE. (C) Optical image of a micrometer-scale
DCE. (D) Schematic of dual-electrode configuration, with two working
electrodes in the barrels of the probe and an Ag/AgCl QRCE in solution.
The current is measured at each working electrode (iE1 and iE2), while the potential
of the working electrodes, with respect to the QRCE, is controlled
by V1 and V2. In the G/C mode, FcTMA+ is oxidized at one electrode
to produce FcTMA2+ that is reduced at the other electrode.

Electrochemical Measurements
A three-electrode configuration
was used, with two working electrodes (the two electrodes of the probe)
and a single Ag/AgCl (silver chloride-coated silver wire) quasi reference/counter
electrode (QRCE) in the bulk of the solution, as illustrated in Figure 1D. In the G/C mode, the potential of one electrode
was set to 0.5 V with respect to the QRCE for the diffusion-limited
one-electron oxidation of FcTMA+ to FcTMA2+,
and the other electrode was at 0 V with respect to the QRCE for the
diffusion-limited one-electron reduction of FcTMA2+. This
was achieved in our electrochemical configuration by setting V1 = 0.5 V and V2 = −0.5 V (Figure 1D). The current
at each working electrode was measured using a custom-built high sensitivity
bipotentiostat (see the section S5 of the Supporting
Information for a description of the SECM instrument).

Simulations
and Theory
Electrochemical measurements
provide a quick estimation of the apparent size of an electrode.29 We developed a steady-state three-dimensional
(3D) FEM simulation of nanoscale (100–1000 nm) DCEs based on
the probe geometry observed in SEM images of typical nanoscale DCEs
(e.g., Figure 1B) to estimate the probe geometry
from steady-state diffusion-limited currents. A full description of
the FEM simulation, including Figure S1 of the Supporting Information showing the probe geometry and example
diffusion profiles, is given in section S6 of the Supporting Information.

The electrodes in the probe
are semielliptical in shape, and the model is configured so that there
are only two independent variables, the major axis size for each of
the electrodes. Thus, in principle, only two current measurements
are needed to determine the geometry of the probe.

Platinization
of Carbon Nanoelectrodes
Carbon nanoelectrodes
were platinized in a solution of chloroplatinic acid H2PtCl6 (2 mM) in 0.1 M sulfuric acid. The reduction of
Pt at the carbon nanoelectrode was induced by cycling the potential
twice from −1 to +0.5 V, at a scan rate of 750 mV s–1.

Results and Discussion
DCEs were fabricated with a
high success rate (ca. 85%, based on
more than 100 made) on the day of use, with approximately 3 min required
per tip. A typical DCE (see Figure 1, panels
B and C) consists of two planar semielliptical electrodes separated
by a septum and surrounded by glass. The septum size and small surround
of glass are typical for probes constructed from theta nanopipets
by the laser pulling technique.24,25,38

Each electrode of a DCE was individually characterized using
the
steady-state currents for the one-electron oxidation of FcTMA+ obtained from linear sweep voltammograms. Typical examples
for each of the two electrodes of a single probe are shown in Figure 2A. As expected, the LSVs show a sigmoidal response.
When coplanar electrodes are assumed, the different magnitude of the
limiting currents for each electrode, within an individual probe,
indicates that the electrodes are not the same size. Generally, the
individual electrodes in a single probe may have slightly different
sizes due to asymmetry in the individual barrel sizes in the pulled
theta pipet.

Figure 2 (A) LSVs (20 mV s–1) for the oxidation
of FcTMA+ to FcTMA2+ at each individual electrode
in a nanoscale
DCE, while the other electrode was unconnected. (B) LSV for generation
(electrode 1) and corresponding collection current (electrode 2) for
FcTMA+/FcTMA2+, as the potential of the generator
electrode (x-ordinate value) was swept and the collector
electrode potential was held at 0 V. (C) The geometry sets, for electrode
1 in blue and electrode 2 in red, calculated from a FEM model that
can generate the single barrel currents. The two geometry sets are
consistent with electrode 1 major axis radius 500 ± 50 nm and
electrode 2 major axis radius 400 ± 25 nm. (D) The set of geometries,
for electrode 1 in blue and electrode 2 in red, calculated from the
FEM model that is consistent with the generation and collection currents.
The two are self-consistent at electrode 1 major axis radius 450 ±
50 nm and electrode 2 major axis radius 400 ± 50 nm. (E) Collection
efficiencies, from simulations, for a range of probe sizes.

This DCE was then used in the
G/C mode, with the FcTMA+/2+ redox couple. The potential
of the generation electrode was swept
for the oxidation of FcTMA+ to FcTMA2+, while
the potential of the collection electrode was held constant at 0 V
for the reduction of any FcTMA2+ back to FcTMA+. The resulting generation and collection currents are shown in Figure 2B. The generation current shows the typical sigmoidal
shape; however, the magnitude of the limiting current is slightly
larger than observed for the single-electrode response above, as the
second electrode regenerates FcTMA+, so providing positive
redox feedback to the generator electrode. The collection current
shows a similar sigmoidal shape, resulting from the change in local
FcTMA2+ concentration induced by the generator electrode.
The ratio of collection current to generation current defines the
collection efficiency, and this probe had a diffusion-limited collection
efficiency of ca. 30%. This reasonable collection efficiency is achieved
because the small distance between the two electrodes minimizes diffusional
losses.

Nanoscale DCE Characterization
While nanoscale electrodes
can be routinely fabricated,39,40 the resulting probe
geometry is often difficult to determine precisely.29 In principle, it is possible to determine the individual
probe geometry for a DCE by SEM after experiments; however, this was
found to be problematic due to crystallization of the redox species
and supporting electrolyte on the probe. Practically, the estimation
of probe geometry is usually achieved by using analytical expressions,
or simulations, to relate the experimental current responses to electrode
dimension, taking care to avoid pit falls due to nonplanar geometrical
affects (especially recessed electrodes).41−43 More complex
geometries, such as the probes used herein, need custom FEM simulations
to determine probe geometries from current measurements. A FEM model
of the DCE was formulated so that the geometry only depended on the
size of the electrode major axes and this allowed the geometry to
be determined from only two current measurements.

We calculated
the sizes of the nanoscale electrodes in the DCE used to record the
data in Figure 2 (panels A and B), using the
FEM model. First, the geometry was calculated from the diffusion-limited
currents at the individual electrodes (Figure 2A). The probe size (defined by the size of the major axes) consistent
with the diffusion-limited current measured at electrode 1 is shown
in blue in Figure 2C, while the probe size
consistent with the measured limiting current for electrode 2 is shown
in red. Note that for this model, the size of a particular electrode,
as determined from its current, shows a weak dependence on the size
of the other (unconnected) electrode because changing the size of
the latter electrode changes the minor axis size (and also the septum
and glass surround width). For example, a smaller unconnected electrode
promotes more back diffusion and a slightly higher current at the
active electrode. The point at which the two curves in Figure 2C intersect, 500 ± 50 nm for electrode 1 and
400 ± 25 nm for electrode 2, is the only possible probe geometry,
constrained by the model assumptions, which could produce the two
individual electrode currents.

The geometry of the probe can
also be calculated from the diffusion-limited
generation/collection currents, shown in Figure 2 B. With electrode 1 generating FcTMA2+ and electrode
2 collecting FcTMA2+ (i.e., both electrodes active), the
calculated probe size consistent with the measured generation current
is shown in blue in Figure 2D, while the probe
size consistent with the measured collection current is shown in red.
Again, the point at which these two sets of electrode sizes intersect,
the electrode 1 major axis of 450 ± 50 nm and electrode 2 major
axis of 400 ± 50 nm was the geometry of the probe, constrained
by the model assumptions, calculated from the generation/collection
currents. It is evident that the size of electrode 1, from the two
geometry calculations 500 ± 50 nm versus 450 ± 50 nm, is
reasonably consistent, as is the size of electrode 2, 400 ± 25
nm versus 400 ± 50 nm.

Working surfaces, from which electrode
sizes for different currents
can be determined, were constructed from the FEM model, and these
are shown in Figure S2 and section S7 of the Supporting
Information. This highlights that the G/C experiments are particularly
sensitive to the probe size. In addition, the calculated collection
efficiency is shown in Figure 2E. This shows
that probes with similar-sized electrodes have collection efficiencies
of ca. 30%. A relative increase in generation electrode size compared
to the collection electrode results in a decrease in collection efficiency,
while decreasing the generator electrode size increases the collection
efficiency.

SECM Measurements
DCEs were deployed
in SECM to investigate
their behavior, in G/C mode, close to the surfaces. With FcTMA+ oxidation at one (generator) electrode and FcTMA2+ reduction at the second (collector) electrode, DCEs were translated
toward insulating (glass) and conductive (gold) surfaces using the
IC-SECM mode.32 With IC-SECM, the probe
is oscillated normal to the surface (in this case with an amplitude
of 32 nm at 70 Hz frequency), and damping of the oscillation amplitude
is detected when the tip comes into physical intermittent contact
with the surface. This mode provides a current-independent means of
detecting when the tip and the substrate surface make contact, which
is valuable for estimating the distance between the probe tip and
the surface during the approach curve measurements.

The DCE
generation and collection currents for approaches to glass and gold
surfaces are shown in Figure 3 (panels A and
B), respectively. The position at which the tip comes into contact
with the surface is seen as a sharp drop in the tip position oscillation
amplitude (Figure 3, panels C and D). For convenience,
this point is assigned as a distance of 0 μm between the probe
electrode and the surface, although in reality, imperfection in the
probe alignment and geometry lead to nonzero distances between the
active electrodes and the surface.44

Figure 3 (A) Generation
and collection currents during the approach of a
DCE probe to an insulating (glass) substrate, with the results for
a FEM simulation (generation electrode major axis size of 120 nm and
collection electrode major axis size of 95 nm) of the same system.
(B) Generation and collection currents, for an approach to a conducting
(gold) substrate, with the results for a FEM simulation (generation
electrode major axis size of 160 nm and collection electrode major
axis size of 440 nm). (C and D) Probe oscillation amplitude, showing
a sharp decrease that indicates probe contact with the surface, for
(A and B, respectively). (E) Experimental collection efficiencies
for (A and B).

When approaching the
inert substrate, the generation current decreases,
but interestingly, the collection current increases before dropping
off when the tip is very close to the substrate. The transient increase
in the collection current is because the substrate confines the generated
species, FcTMA2+, close to the electrodes, limiting diffusional
losses, so leading to enhanced diffusional coupling between the two
electrodes. However, once the tip gets much closer to the inert surface,
the significant decrease in the generation current, due to the blocking
effect of the substrate on the diffusion of FcTMA+ to the
generator, causes the collection current to decrease. On the other
hand, Figure 3E clearly shows that the absolute
collection efficiency increases as the distance from the substrate
surface decreases. In this plot, the collection efficiency at a particular
distance is normalized with respect to that measured in bulk solution.

The approach to a conducting substrate shows that the generation
current increases with a decrease of the distance to the substrate
(positive feedback),45 while the collection
electrode is in competition with the substrate and thus as the tip
gets closer to the substrate, the current at this electrode drops.
This competition increases with closer tip/substrate separation and
so the collection efficiency decreases monotonically throughout an
approach (Figure 3E). The data in Figure 3E highlights that the morphology of an SECM collection
efficiency approach curve is hugely sensitive to the nature of the
substrate, and this provides a route to functional imaging of surface
processes, as we demonstrate below.

We now use the FEM model
to assess the approach curves. The sizes
of the individual electrodes in the probes used for the approach curve
experiments were calculated from the steady-state (bulk) generation
and collection currents, as described above. For the approach to the
insulating surface, the apparent probe dimensions were defined by
120 nm for the generator electrode major axis and 95 nm for the collector
electrode major axis, while for the approach to the conducting surface,
the generator electrode major axis was 160 nm, and the collector electrode
major axis was 440 nm. Simulation results for approach curves, with
the probe perfectly aligned to the surface (which is an approximation
as already discussed), to both insulating and conducting substrates
were calculated and are shown in black in Figure 3 (panels A and B). These show the same topological features
as observed in the experimental results, most obviously the increase
in collection current when approaching an insulating substrate. However,
quantitative differences are evident between the experimental and
simulation results, particularly during the approach to the insulating
substrate (Figure 3A). In this case, the decrease
in experimental generator current is apparent at a distance which
we would not expect based on the simulation. This suggests that the
true probe geometry is larger than determined from the model, and
that, in turn, the electrode is recessed. Such recessions are not
uncommon in nanoscale electrodes,29,46 and quantitative
analysis of approach curves is a powerful way of highlighting nonidealized
electrode geometries.41 While we could
develop our model to account for misalignment of the probe with respect
to the surface and nonideal geometry, this would introduce a number
of extra independent parameters, which are not needed for the initial
applications herein, in which we seek to demonstrate attributes of
DCE generation-collection measurements in a semiquantitative fashion.

Probing Redox Reactions at Thylakoid Membranes
We demonstrate
the use of generation-collection measurements to monitor the reactions
of an artificial electron acceptor at thylakoid membranes during photosynthesis.
The SECM configuration allowed the DCE to be placed close to, but
not touching, a monolayer of thylakoid membranes. The DCE, operated
in G/C mode, also allowed a flux of the artificial electron acceptor
(FcTMA2+) to be generated locally in a controllable manner
and permitted the local flux of both FcTMA2+ and FcTMA+ to be measured concurrently, with good time resolution.

The interaction of electrogenerated FcTMA2+ with thylakoid
membranes was investigated using the DCE shown in Figure 1C in the G/C mode, as illustrated in Figure 4A. The probe was placed over a sparse monolayer
of thylakoid membranes (a typical surface coverage is indicated in
the fluorescence image of Figure 4B) and approached
in the dark to the point of maximum collection current, as shown in
the approach curve in Figure 4C. Note that
the morphologies of the generator and collector current approach curves
are consistent with the thylakoid membrane presenting an inert surface,
as discussed above. The probe was then held stationary while the sample
was illuminated using the fluorescence microscope (at a wavelength
of 470 nm with an intensity of 3.5 × 1016 photons s–1 cm–2) for a period
of 30 s, and the generation and collection currents during this time
were measured. Figure 4 (panels D and E) shows
the relative change in the generation current and collection current
during this period, respectively. Upon illumination, it is apparent
that FcTMA2+ is reduced to FcTMA+ at the thylakoid
membranes, as there is an increase in the magnitude of the generation
current and a decrease in the magnitude of the collection current.
Interestingly, a steady-state response is quickly reached, with a
ca. 30 pA increase in the generation current and a corresponding ca.
30 pA decrease in the collection current. FcTMA2+ reduction
at the thylakoid membranes ceases immediately when the light is turned
off, as evidenced by the return to the generation and collection currents
to original values. This corresponds to a turnover rate of FcTMA2+ to FcTMA+ of ca. 2 × 108 s–1. An advantage of the DCE probe is that the electron
acceptor is generated locally and the spatial resolution is correspondingly
high, approximating to the tip size.

Figure 4 (A) Schematic of the DCE in the generation/collection
mode, with
the FcTMA+/2+ couple, above a sparse monolayer of thylakoid
membranes. (B) Fluorescence microscopy image of a sparse monolayer
of thylakoid membranes, observed as green spots on the surface. (C)
Approach curves for placing the DCE above the surface containing thylakoid
membranes (probe size defined in text). (D) Generation current response
as the monolayer of thylakoid membranes is illuminated with and without
DCMU. (E) Collection current response as the monolayer of thylakoid
membranes is illuminated with and without DCMU.

To confirm the FcTMA2+ reaction with illuminated
thylakoid
membranes, the herbicide, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimenthylurea
(DCMU), which blocks the linear electron transport pathway36 was added. As observed in Figure 4 (panels D and E), the addition of 10 μM DCMU essentially
entirely eliminated the light-mediated response. This confirms that
FcTMA2+ is reduced by a component of the photosynthetic
electron transport pathway. Interestingly, we can exclude the possibility
that FcTMA2+ accepts electrons directly from PSII, as is
the case, for example, with silicomolybdate because DCMU inhibits
the electron transport pathway after this point.36

Thylakoid Membrane Imaging
A DCE
in G/C mode was used
to image a single thylakoid membrane. The probe (generator electrode
major axis ca. 1700 nm and collector major axis ca. 700 nm) was placed
directly above a single thylakoid membrane at a distance where the
maximum collection current was detected (as above) and then scanned
laterally across the sample at a constant height in the G/C mode.
The sample was illuminated (470 nm, at 3.5 × 1016 photons
s–1 cm–2) during the scan to activate
the photosynthetic response at the membrane.

A fluorescence
image of the thylakoid membrane, due to the autofluorescence of chlorophyll,
is shown in Figure 5A. This matches well with
the electrochemical images of the thylakoid membrane, one from the
generation current (Figure 5B) and one from
the collection current (Figure 5C) obtained
in a single image scan with a DCE. The decrease in generation current
over the thylakoid membrane is predominantly the result of local topography
features, which is expected as thylakoid membranes are typically 2–4
μm in height. The collection current also decreases over the
thylakoid membrane. However, the collection efficiency (Figure 5D) decreases over the thylakoid membrane. This is
only possible over an active surface, as shown in the approach curves
in Figure 3 and indicates that the thylakoid
membranes are actively consuming the electrogenerated FcTMA2+. The effect is very subtle and would be difficult to detect from
a single probe SECM feedback measurement, not the least because of
the convolution of activity and topography in such measurements and
the fact that the activity of a single thylakoid membrane is low.
Although the substrate generation/tip collection mode might allow
the processes to be probed, this would require FcTMA2+ in
bulk solution and this mode is characterized generally by a significant
loss of spatial resolution.40,44 In contrast, we see
the degree of activity very readily in the collection efficiency image.
Although a simple constant height SECM imaging technique was presented
here a further important aspect of these probes is that one could
use the response of one electrode to sense topography and the other
to sense substrate activity.22

Platinization of Carbon
Nanoelectrodes
Finally, we
consider preliminary experiments that show DCEs can be easily and
selectively modified, though with the selective deposition of Pt on
one electrode while leaving the other one unmodified. Figure S3 in
the Supporting Information shows CVs of
1 mM ferrocenemethanol oxidation in aerated solution, for the individual
electrodes of a probe, before and after the selective deposition of
Pt on one of the electrodes. The deposition of Pt dramatically changes
the catalytic properties of the electrode toward oxygen reduction,
as can be seen by the additional oxygen reduction current observed
in the negative potential region of Figure S3B of the Supporting Information. However, the deposition
of Pt does not appreciably change the size of the electrode, as the
ferrocenemethanol oxidation limiting current does not change noticeably
with the Pt deposition. This highlights the possibility of using DCEs
for electrochemical sensing which, with further developments, may
allow multicomponent chemical analysis at the nanoscale.

Conclusions
DCEs are simple and quick to fabricate with a wide range of tunable
electrode sizes. The probes are well suited to SECM experiments because
of the relatively small total size of the end of the probe enabling
close positioning to an interface, while the small interelectrode
distance leads to high sensitivity.

For nanoscale DCEs, a FEM
model was developed to assist in characterizing
the probe size based on simple steady-state limiting current measurements.
The electrode sizes were calculated from either single barrel FcTMA+ oxidation currents or the G/C currents. This allowed us to
estimate the apparent probe geometry from two different measurements
and compare them. However, as highlighted in the approach curve measurements,
the FEM model does not capture subtle geometric imperfections, such
as protruding or recessed electrodes or slight misalignment of the
probe. Nonetheless, these initial studies highlight that the probes
can be used in a semiquantitative fashion and, if required, the morphology
of approach curves could be further analyzed to provide additional
information on these imperfections.

We have demonstrated that
DCEs can be used to interrogate interfaces
and surfaces with high sensitivity. DCEs were used to assess local
changes in the FcTMA+ and FcTMA2+ flux during
illumination of thylakoid membranes and in 2D imaging of a single
thylakoid membrane. In both cases, subtle interactions of electrogenerated
electron acceptors with the active surface were determined readily
through the G/C response.

Further work to extract the geometry
from current-based measurements
could expand the quantitative capabilities of these probes. In addition,
we have shown that individual probes within the DCE can be functionalized,
as exemplified by selective deposition of Pt on one electrode while
leaving the other one unmodified. Platinized nanoelectrodes have been
shown to be promising probes for intracellular measurements.47 DCEs may thus find applications as single-cell
chemical sensors and other modifications are evidently realizable.
