Fast-scan
cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) can detect small changes in
dopamine concentration; however, measurements are typically limited
to scan repetition frequencies of 10 Hz. Dopamine oxidation at carbon-fiber
microelectrodes (CFMEs) is dependent on dopamine adsorption, and increasing
the frequency of FSCV scan repetitions decreases the oxidation current,
because the time for adsorption is decreased. Using a commercially
available carbon nanotube yarn, we characterized carbon nanotube yarn
microelectrodes (CNTYMEs) for high-speed measurements with FSCV. For
dopamine, CNTYMEs have a significantly lower ΔEp than CFMEs, a limit of detection of 10 ± 0.8 nM,
and a linear response to 25 μM. Unlike CFMEs, the oxidation
current of dopamine at CNTYMEs is independent of scan repetition frequency.
At a scan rate of 2000 V/s, dopamine can be detected, without any
loss in sensitivity, with scan frequencies up to 500 Hz, resulting
in a temporal response that is four times faster than CFMEs. While
the oxidation current is adsorption-controlled at both CFMEs and CNTYMEs,
the adsorption and desorption kinetics differ. The desorption coefficient
of dopamine-o-quinone (DOQ), the oxidation product
of dopamine, is an order of magnitude larger than that of dopamine
at CFMEs; thus, DOQ desorbs from the electrode and can diffuse away.
At CNTYMEs, the rates of desorption for dopamine and dopamine-o-quinone are about equal, resulting in current that is
independent of scan repetition frequency. Thus, there is no compromise
with CNTYMEs: high sensitivity, high sampling frequency, and high
temporal resolution can be achieved simultaneously. Therefore, CNTYMEs
are attractive for high-speed applications.

Carbon fibers
(CFs) are one
of the most common microelectrode materials for electrochemical detection
of neurotransmitters because of their small diameter, electrochemical
properties, adsorption affinity for cationic neurotransmitters, and
compatibility with fast electrochemical methods.1−6 Carbon-fiber microelectrodes (CFMEs), coupled with constant potential
amperometry, can perform sensitive, high temporal resolution measurements;7−10 however, the intrinsic lack of analyte selectivity limits the usefulness
of amperometry to instances in which the analyte identity is already
known. Thus, amperometry has limited utility in chemically complex
environments. Measurements in environments such as the intact brain,
where a mixture of chemicals could be present, require a technique
that provides chemical identification. Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry
(FSCV) has become a preferred method for in vivo measurements,
because it provides a chemical fingerprint that aids in chemical identification.6,11−15 The sensitivity for cationic neurotransmitters, such as dopamine,
using FSCV is typically limited by adsorption onto the electrode surface,
and increasing the scan repetition frequency dramatically decreases
the electrode sensitivity. This necessitates a compromise between
the sampling frequency of the measurements and the sensitivity. Typically,
a scan repetition frequency of 10 Hz is used as the optimal sampling
frequency.16−18 However, a recent study compared FSCV scan frequencies
at 10 and 60 Hz and found that measurements taken at 10 Hz significantly
underestimate rapid uptake rates.1 Thus,
in order to characterize rapid concentration changes in vivo, the sampling frequency and the temporal resolution of neurotransmitter
detection must be improved.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are a promising
microelectrode material,
because of the rapid electron transfer kinetics and the increased
sensitivity demonstrated at larger CNT-based electrodes.19−21 Electrodes incorporating CNTs have been made by modifying the CFME
surface with CNTs through a dip-coating process,22,23 using a polymer-CNT matrix fiber as the electroactive material,24 and by the synthesis of aligned CNT arrays on
larger silicon or metal substrates.19,25−27 Dip-coating procedures apply a film of randomly oriented CNTs on
the electrode surface, but these films are often heterogeneous in
thickness and a large portion of the exposed CNT surface is sidewall.
The oxide functional groups primarily responsible for the adsorption
of neurotransmitters are more prevalent at defect sites and at CNT
ends than on CNT sidewalls. To maximize neurotransmitter adsorption
sites, arrays of vertically aligned CNTs are preferred, but the resulting
electrodes are often on the millimeter scale, which is too large for
implantation into tissue.17,20,28,29 As an alternative, CNTs have
been aligned on an electrode surface with chemical self-assembly,
resulting in an electrode with significantly higher sensitivity toward
dopamine.30 Similar to CFMEs, the sensitivity
of these carbon nanotube forest electrodes decreases as the repetition
frequencies increase; however, the electrodes have a greater sensitivity,
so a 90 Hz scan frequency could detect signals similar to bare CFMEs
at 10 Hz.30 While CNT-based microelectrodes
have some promising characteristics the fabrication of reliable and
reproducible microelectrodes has been challenging. Thus, CNT-based
materials have not been routinely used as a replacement for CFs.

In this paper, we explore the use of carbon nanotube yarns (CNTYs)
as an electrode material for enhanced neurotransmitter detection.
CNTYs typically range from 10 μm to 50 μm in diameter
and are commercially available for industrial purposes in lengths
up to several kilometers long.31−34 Various types of CNTYs have been used for deep brain
stimulation,35 in glucose enzyme sensors,36−39 and for detection of dopamine in brain slices.40 Here, we investigate the use of CNTY microelectrodes (CNTYMEs)
for high-frequency measurements of dopamine, resulting in increased
temporal resolution. The adsorption and desorption of dopamine (DA)
and dopamine-o-quinone (DOQ) at CNTYMEs differ dramatically
from those at traditional CFMEs, which facilitates FSCV measurements
of dopamine at 500 Hz without a loss in sensitivity. The ability to
make high-frequency measurements at CNTYMEs is a substantial benefit
over CFMEs and makes CNTYMEs attractive for high-speed applications.

Experimental
Section
Solutions
Dopamine hydrochloride and potassium hexachloroiridate(IV)
(K2IrCl6) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO). Ten millimolar (10 mM) stock solutions of the analytes
were prepared in HClO4, and were diluted daily to the desired
concentration in Tris-buffer (15 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane,
3.25 mM KCl, 140 mM NaCl, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgCl2, and 2.0 mM Na2SO4, with the pH adjusted to 7.4).

Carbon Nanotube
Yarn Microelectrode Preparation
A length
of commercially available CNTY 10–25 μm in diameter,
1–2 cm long, (General Nano, LLC, Cincinnati, OH) was either
(1) inserted into a polyimide coated fused-silica capillary while
submerged in 2-propanol, to reduce friction and ease insertion (45
μm inner diameter (ID) × 90 μm outer diameter (OD),
Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ),41 or (2) inserted into a 0.68 mm ID × 1.2 mm OD glass capillary
that had previously been pulled into a glass pipet and cut to have
an opening diameter of ∼50 μm. The solvent was allowed
to fully evaporate from inside of the capillary before the CNTY was
sealed into the capillary with Loctite brand 5 min epoxy and was allowed
to fully cure for 24 h. The resulting microelectrode was polished
at an ∼90° angle on a Sutter Instruments polishing wheel
with subsequent coarse and fine polishing disks to make a disk CNTYME.
For comparison, carbon fiber microelectrodes (CFMEs) were also fabricated,
insulated, and polished in a similar manner using 7-μm-diameter
T-650 carbon fibers (Cytec Technologies, Woodland Park, NJ).22

Electrochemistry
FSCV was performed
with a custom built
instrument and a ChemClamp potentiometer (Dagan, Minneapolis, MN, n = 0.01 headstage), PCI 6711 and 6052 computer interface
cards (National Instruments, Austin, TX) and home-built breakout box.
Electrodes were backfilled with 1 M KCl and a silver wire was inserted
to connect the electrode to the potentiostat headstage. The typical
triangular waveform swept the applied potential from −0.4 V
to 1.3 V at 400 V/s versus a Ag/AgCl reference electrode, at a scan
frequency of 10 Hz, except where noted. Data collection was computer-controlled
by the TarHeel CV software program.12

Electrodes were tested using a flow-injection system, as previously
described.42 Analyte injections lasting
4 s were made and the current versus time traces were obtained by
integrating the current in a 100 mV window centered at the oxidation
peak for each cyclic voltammogram (CV). Background-subtracted CVs
were calculated by subtracting the average of 10 background scans,
taken before the compound was injected, from the average of five CVs
recorded after the analyte bolus was injected.

electron microscopy techniques and the Raman spectroscopy instrumentation
can be found in the Supporting Information.

Statistics
GraphPad Prism 4.0 was used for all statistics
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). All averaged values are given
as the mean ± SEM (standard error of the mean) for “n” number of electrodes, unless otherwise noted.
Normalized signals were calculated for individual electrodes before
being averaged. Significance is defined as p = 0.05.

Results and Discussion
Surface Characterization
Carbon
nanotube yarns (CNTYs)
consist of two or more multiwalled CNT (MWCNT) threads twisted together,
each typically ∼5 μm in diameter. Because multiple threads
are twisted together, CNTYs do not have perfectly circular cross sections,
and often have localized areas that vary in CNT density.31,34 The cross-section of the CNTY typically ranges between 5 μm
and 25 μm, but microelectrode fabrication in pulled glass capillaries
can yield carbon nanotube yarn microelectrodes (CNTYMEs) with electrode
tips smaller than the original measured cross-section of the CNTY,
because the yarn can compress.43 The SEM
image in Figure 1A shows an example of a pulled
glass capillary disk microelectrode, with a tip diameter of 10 μm.
High-magnification SEM images of the CNTYME surface (Figure 1B) shows a multitude of small circles, each about
30 nm in diameter, which suggests that the surface consists primarily
of CNT ends.

Figure 1 Surface characterization of a carbon nanotube yarn microelectrode
(CNTYME): (A) SEM image of the polished surface of a CNTYME fabricated
in a pulled-glass capillary; (B) SEM image of the electrode surface
shows the ends of individual 30–50 nm diameter CNTs bundled
tightly together to form a nanostructured surface; (C) Raman spectrum
shows first-order features of a peak at 1328 cm–1 (D-band, generally associated with defects), at 1582 cm–1 (G-band, the high-frequency E2g first-order mode), and
a peak at 1618 cm–1 (D′-band, which can be
explained by double-resonance theory. (Two double resonance features
observed as a shoulder at 2488 cm–1 and a prominent
band at 2652 (D″ band).) (D) The relative ratio of D to G band
intensities. (A false color map of the calculated D/G-band intensity
ratio across the CNTY electrode surface shows a surface with many
defects, particularly in the central part of the electrode.) The optical
image of the CNTYME surface (inset) reveals the typical noncircular
shape of the CNT yarn that corresponds to the spectroscopic Raman
surface map. Red lines indicate the point where the spectrum in panel
(C) was taken.

To further characterize
the CNT surface, Raman spectra of freshly
prepared electrodes were measured. A characteristic Raman spectrum
of the CNTYME shows first- and second-order peaks between 1000 cm–1 and 2800 cm–1 (Figure 1C). The double resonance feature of the D-band peak
(1328 cm–1) gives information on the density of
the defects in the CNTs, as well as the MWCNT diameter if MWCNT are
aligned.44,45 The second prominent first-order feature
is the G-band (1582 cm–1), which is common for all
graphitic carbon structures. The high intensity peak at 1618 cm–1 could be due to the D′-band of carbon nanotubes;
however, the D′ peak of MWCNTs is usually weak with the 632
nm detection used here and only becomes prominent under NIR excitation
of 1064 nm.45 The 1618 cm–1 peak may also be attributed to the delamination of graphitic carbon
caused by adjacent oxide functional groups.46−49 A double resonance feature of
the D″ peak (2650 cm–1) and a shoulder band
at 2488 cm–1 were also observed.

The D and
G band features were further analyzed because the nature
of these bands is better understood. The full width at half-maximum
(fwhm) of the D band is 48 cm–1 and can be used
to estimate the CNT diameter by calibration of the D-band fwhm, as
a function of 1/d.44 Assuming
the microelectrode surface primarily consists of CNT ends aligned
perpendicular to the laser polarization, the diameter is estimated
to be 29 nm. If the CNT ends were pulled out from the yarn enough
to bend and become parallel to the laser polarization, then the diameter
would be 57 nm instead. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (see Figure S-2 in the Supporting Information), verified
the CNT diameters range from ∼20 nm to 40 nm, with the majority
being ∼30 nm. The agreement in diameter between the TEM measurement
and the Raman data suggest that the electrode surface consists primarily
of CNT ends and not CNT sidewalls. The Raman map of absolute G-band
intensity (Figure S-2 in the Supporting Information) suggests that the CNT density is higher at the center of the yarn,
which is consistent with previous studies on CNTY structure.31,34 A false-color map of the ratio of ID/IG-band intensity (Figure 1D) reveals variation in defect density across the surface.50,51 The entire CNTYME surface has a ID/IG band ratio higher than 1, which indicates
that the entire surface is defect-rich. Pristine CNT samples would
be expected to yield very low ID/IG-band ratios of ≪1.

Electrochemical
Characterization
Figure 2 compares
dopamine redox at a CNTYME (Figure 2A) and
a CFME (Figure 2B) using the
typical FSCV waveform scanning from −0.4 V to 1.3 V and back
at 400 V/s and a scan repetition frequency of 10 Hz (solid black lines).
The general shape of the CVs are similar, but the CNTYME displays
a sharper oxidation peak (ip,a) and reduction peak (ip,c) than the CFME. The potential difference between the oxidation
and reduction peak voltages (ΔEp) is smaller at the CNTYME, implying that it may have faster electron
transfer kinetics than the CFME.

Figure 2 Comparison of the effect of FSCV scan
repetition rate at (A) a
carbon nanotube yarn disk microelectrode (CNTYME) and (B) a carbon
fiber disk microelectrode (CFME). One micromolar (1 μM) dopamine
is detected using a scan rate of 400 V/s. The repetition rate is either
10 Hz (solid black traces) or 100 Hz (dashed red traces).

The measured current for dopamine oxidation is
linear up to 25
μM and the limit of detection for dopamine was determined to
be 8 ± 1 nM (n = 8) at CNTYMEs, indicating that
CNTYMEs are suitable for detecting low concentrations of dopamine
(see Figure S-4 in the Supporting Information). The Sombers laboratory utilized a different CNT yarn for dopamine
detection and found an LOD of 13 ± 2 nM, which is similar to
our measurements.40 This suggests that
our microelectrodes using the commercially available CNT yarns have
sensitivities that are similar to the previously investigated CNTY
microelectrodes, even though the CNT yarn materials are not identical.
However, the effect of increased scan repetition frequency at CNTYMEs
was not been investigated.

Increasing the repetition rate from
10 Hz to 100 Hz reduces the
time between scans from 91.5 ms to 1.5 ms, respectively, dramatically
reducing the time for dopamine to adsorb to the electrode surface.
The red, dashed traces in Figure 2 show CVs
measured with a scan repetition frequency of 100 Hz at the same electrode
as the 10 Hz traces. The oxidation and reduction currents at the CFME
decreases with the 100 Hz repetition rate (Figure 2B). At the CNTYME (Figure 2A), however,
CVs at both frequencies have almost-identical oxidation currents.

Figures 3A and 3B
show the effect of repetition frequency on the average peak oxidation
current (normalized to the peak current at 10 Hz for each electrode).
At CFMEs, ip,a decreases dramatically
as the repetition rate is increased; doubling the repetition rate
from 10 Hz to 20 Hz reduces the current by 40% and increasing the
repetition frequency to 110 Hz decreases the ip,a by 78%. At CFMEs, this trend had a slope of −0.59
± 0.05 and was significantly nonzero (p <
0.0001, n = 4). In contrast, the oxidation current
at CNTYMEs does not change between 10 Hz and 110 Hz, and the slope
of the trend line is 0.03 ± 0.05 for CNTYME, which was not significantly
different from zero (p = 0.5323, n = 10). Although the surface is heterogeneous, the trend of scan-frequency-independent
current was consistent across electrodes. Seventy percent (70%) of
CNTYMEs had no change in current with frequency and ∼30% displayed
either a slight increase or decrease in current; however, the oxidation
current did not change by more than 20% at any CNTYME. Thus, the oxidation
current is dependent on scan frequency at CFMEs but is frequency independent
at CNTYMEs. The reduction currents have similar trends as the oxidation
currents (Figure 3B); they do not decrease
at higher scan frequencies at CNTYMEs, but they do at CFMEs.

Figure 3 Effect of scan
repetition frequency on dopamine measurement at
CNTYME and CFMEs: (A) peak oxidation current, and (B) peak reduction
current at CNTYMEs (red circles, n = 10) and CFMEs
(black triangles, n = 4). Peak currents were normalized
to the current at 10 Hz, and error bars represent the standard error
of the mean. (C) Oxidation current for a CNTYME for 1 μM dopamine
plotted against (C) scan rate and (D) the square root of scan rate.
The linearity between dopamine oxidation current and scan rate indicates
that dopamine oxidation is surface-dependent at CNTYMEs.

Previous studies of CNT microelectrodes did not
observe a current
that was independent of scan frequency.30 At CNT forest electrodes, where CNTs were attached to CFMEs using
chemical self-assembly, the oxidation current decreases with increasing
frequency, similar to CFMEs.30 The alignment
of CNTs in the yarns may be better than in the chemical self-assembly
method, leading to more CNT ends exposed and a different surface for
adsorption.

The temporal response of dopamine oxidation at CFMEs
and CNTYMEs
is compared by measuring the time required for the signal to change
from 10% to 90% of the maximum oxidation current after the injection
of a dopamine bolus. The time response is dependent on the electrode
material and the scan repetition frequency. CFMEs, at the typical
scan rate of 400 V/s, yield a time response of 1.2 ± 0.2 s with
a 10 Hz scan frequency, which decreases to 0.6 ± 0.2 s at a scan
frequency of 110 Hz. Since the current decreases by over 75% at a
scan frequency of 110 Hz, the improved temporal resolution at high
scan frequencies comes with a great tradeoff in sensitivity. Using
the 400 V/s scan rate at CNTYMEs, the temporal response of dopamine
detection is 0.45 ± 0.09 s at 10 Hz and is further improved to
0.27 ± 0.09 s at 110 Hz. The scan frequency does not affect the
current at CNTYMEs, thus the faster time response at higher frequencies
can be utilized without compromising sensitivity. Both the sampling
frequency and the temporal response for dopamine detection can be
improved by almost an order of magnitude utilizing CNTYMEs instead
of CFMEs.

Adsorption Mechanism and Kinetic Modeling
Scan rate
was varied to determine whether dopamine kinetics at CNTYMEs are limited
by diffusion or adsorption. For a diffusion-limited process, ip,a is linear with the square root of scan rate;
however, for an adsorption-limited process, ip,a is linear with scan rate.52 Figures 3C and 3D show that oxidation
current is linear with scan rate and is not linear with the square
root of scan rate at CNYMEs, indicating that it is a surface-dependent
process. The outer-sphere oxidation of IrCl63– is linear with the square root of scan rate at CNYMEs (see Figure S-3 in the Supporting Information) denoting
that this process is diffusion-limited, and confirming that the CNTYME
behaves as expected to a surface-independent analyte.53 Since both CNTYMEs and CFMEs are rate limited by adsorption,
we hypothesized that there must be a difference in the adsorption/desorption
properties between the two microelectrode materials.

The Wightman
group developed a model of FSCV data to determine the rate constants
for the adsorption and desorption kinetics of dopamine (DA) at CFMEs.54 Briefly, the equilibrium reactions between the
electrode surface and the DA or dopamine-o-quinone
(DOQ) in solution are described by  where k1 and k2 are the adsorption
rate constants of DA and
DOQ, respectively, and k–1 and k–2 are the respective desorption rate
constants. During the anodic scan, adsorbed dopamine is oxidized to
DOQ, which can remain adsorbed to the surface or desorb from the electrode.
DOQ that remains on the electrode surface is reduced back to dopamine
during the cathodic scan. If DOQ desorbs prior to the cathodic scan,
the reduction current is smaller than the oxidation current.

During flow injection experiments, a bolus of analyte flows past
the electrode. If the oxidation is surface independent, the current
versus time trace would be square-shaped; i.e., the oxidation current
would rise to the highest value at the introduction of dopamine and
would return to baseline immediately at the end of the bolus. However,
for an adsorption-limited species, such as dopamine, the concentration
at the electrode surface requires time to reach equilibrium after
the introduction of DA. Thus, the current versus time response is
slowed and the curve is rounded, and both adsorption and desorption
parameters can be extracted from the shape of the curve. Current versus
time curves for 1 μM dopamine measured at five distinct scan
frequencies, between 10 Hz and 110 Hz, were simultaneously modeled
to determine the adsorption and desorption rate constants for CFMEs
and CNTYMEs. Figure 4 compares the measured
current vs time curves (solid, black) to the best-fit simulation curves
(dashed, red). There is a good fit between the model and measured
curves at all five frequencies (r2 >
0.9650).
The adsorption constants for DA and DOQ are similar to each other
at both CFMEs (k1 ≈ k2 ≈ 6 × 10–3 cm/s) and CNTYMEs
(k1 ≈ k2 ≈ 10 × 10–3 cm/s). The desorption
values of DA and DOQ at CFMEs differ by almost an order of magnitude,
with DOQ desorbing faster (k–1 =
0.8 s–1 vs k–2 = 15 s–1). However, at CNTYMEs, the rate constants
for the desorption of DA and DOQ were nearly identical (k–1 = 4.2 s–1 and k–2 = 4.0 s–1).

Figure 4 Measured current versus
time traces of 1 μM dopamine bolus
injection at a CNTYME and a CFME (solid, black traces) and the best-fit
simulation (dotted, red traces) used to characterize the adsorption
and desorption rate constants. The simulation parameters for this
example CFME are k1 = 5.9 × 10–3 cm s–1, k2 = 6.6 × 10–3 cm s–1, k–1 = 0.84 s–1, and k–2 = 6.1 s–1; the simulation parameters for CNTYME are k1 = 10.1 × 10–3 cm s–1, k2 = 10.1 × 10–3 cm s–1, k–1 = 4.15 s–1, and k–2 = 4.03 s–1. FSCV scan parameters: from −0.4
V to 1.3 V and back at 400 V/s vs Ag|AgCl.

The average rate constants for CFMEs and CNTYMEs are in Table 1. At each type of electrode, the adsorption constants
for dopamine and DOQ are similar to each other, even though the specific
values are different for CFMEs and CNTYMEs. At CNTYMEs, the rates
of desorption for DA and DOQ are almost identical, while at CFMEs,
the rate of desorption for DOQ is over an order of magnitude higher
than that for DA. The desorption constants vary less between electrodes
than the adsorption constants, implying that desorption may not be
as surface-area-dependent as the adsorption.

The calculated equilibrium constant for dopamine at CFMEs is K1 = 7.0 × 10–3 ±
1 × 10–3 cm and for DOQ is K2 = 0.4 × 10–3 ± 0.4 ×
10–3 cm, indicating that adsorption of dopamine
occurs more readily than DOQ to the surface. At CNTYME, K1 (dopamine) = 2.6 × 10–3 ±
0.4 × 10–3 cm and K2 (DOQ) = 3.0 × 10–3 ± 0.5 × 10–3 cm, indicating that both compounds have similar equilibrium
coefficients and thus similar adsorption affinities. The equilibrium
coefficients at CNTYMEs fall between the K1 and K2 values at CFMEs, indicating that the adsorption of DA at CNTYMEs
is not as strong as the adsorption of DA at CFMEs, and that the adsorption
of DOQ is stronger at CNTYMEs compared to CFMEs. The similarity between K1 and K2 at CNTYMEs
also suggests that dopamine oxidation is also more reversible at CNTYMEs
than at CFMEs.

In order for DOQ to be reduced back to dopamine
during the cathodic
scan, DOQ must remain adsorbed to the surface. At CFMEs, the DOQ desorption
rate constant is substantially higher than for dopamine, so the DOQ
leaves the electrode surface more readily and the reduction peak is
smaller than the oxidation peak. The average peak current ratio (Table 1) shows that the reduction current is only ∼60%
of the oxidation current at CFMEs. On average, ip,c/ip,a is larger at CNTYMEs than
CFMEs (0.77 ± 0.01 and 0.62 ± 0.01, respectively), indicating
that dopamine oxidation is more reversible at CNTYMEs. This increase
in reversibility also confirms the modeling data that the adsorption/desorption
kinetics are different between the two electrode materials.

The overpotential values for both oxidation and reduction of dopamine
are significantly reduced at CNTYMEs, yielding a peak separation (ΔEp) that is ∼90 mV lower than at CFMEs
(scan rate = 400 V/s, Table 1, p = 0.001, paired t-test). The reduced ΔEp further suggests enhanced apparent electron
transfer kinetics at CNT-based electrodes.22,29,40,55,56 In particular, the Sombers group showed that a different
type of CNT yarn microelectrode had an ∼2 orders of magnitude
increase in the kinetic rate constant, compared to CFMEs.40 The enhanced electron transfer and the modified
adsorption properties at the CNTYME surface present a mass transport
profile that is distinct from the profile at the CFME surface. Given
the high density of uneven CNTs at the polished electrode surface,
cyclic voltammograms of dopamine at the nanostructured surface are
likely influenced by a mass transport mechanisms such as thin-film
diffusion, as well as adsorption to the CNTYME surface, giving rise
to a current dependence on scan frequency that is distinct from CFMEs.57−59

Increased Temporal Resolution at High Scan Rates
The
typical FSCV scan at a microelectrode has a scan rate of 400 V/s and
takes 8.5 ms, so the maximum repetition frequency is ∼115 Hz.
Increasing the scan rate to 2000 V/s reduces the scan time to 1.7
ms and allows for repetition rates of 500 Hz, which is over 2 orders
of magnitude faster than typical FSCV. The CV analysis in Figure 5A shows the large oxidation and reduction peaks
measured using the 2000 V/s scan rate and 500 Hz frequency, indicating
that FSCV measurements at intervals of 2 ms are possible at CNTYMEs.
The current-versus-time curve for dopamine in Figure 5B is similar to curves at the traditional scan and frequency
rates (as in Figure 4). The higher scan rate
measurements had a temporal response of 0.74 ± 0.07 s when measured
at 10 Hz, but the temporal response was 0.29 ± 0.1 s at the 500
Hz sampling frequency. The noise in the current versus time plot increases
with higher scan rates; however, the increase in signal is proportional
and so the S/N ratio remains at ∼110, similar to measurements
using 400 V/s and 10 Hz waveform. Thus, CNTYMEs allow the sampling
frequency of FSCV measurements to be increased by nearly 2 orders
of magnitude and the temporal response is improved by a factor of

(A) an example background-subtracted CV, and (B) a current-versus-time
trace of a 1 μM dopamine injection, measured at 2000 V/s and
500 Hz. (C) The effect of high scan repetition frequencies on the
peak oxidation current of 1 μM dopamine at CNTYMEs using a scan
rate of 2000 V/s. Data are normalized to the 10 Hz value (n = 4).

Figure 5C shows the oxidation current, measured
at 2000 V/s, at frequencies up to 500 Hz (n = 4).
The horizontal trend of these data indicates that the measured signal
is independent of scan frequency, even at fast scan rates. Thus, dopamine
can be measured at intervals of 2 ms without any loss of current,
which is a significant advantage for CNTYMEs. However, the higher
scan rate also leads to a shift in the measured oxidation and reduction
potentials (Figure 5A), which is most likely
due to the exaggeration of iR drop in the electrochemical
cell and bandwidth limitations of the instrument. To limit distortions
in potential, proper low-pass filtering must be used, and numerous
methods that compensate for iR drop and increase
instrumental bandwidth could be incorporated to further optimize the
high scan rate and high sampling frequency data for ultrafast in vivo dopamine measurements.3,60,61 However, the 2 ms interval is nearly 2 orders of
magnitude better than typical FSCV measurements of dopamine at CFMEs,
and no instrument modification was required. The sampling interval
of FSCV at CNTYMEs is similar to that commonly used with constant
potential amperometry, which is often ∼1 ms.62 Therefore, FSCV measurements, which provide chemical information,
can now be performed on a time scale similar to that of amperometry.

With FSCV at CFMEs, there is always a tradeoff between sensitivity
and time resolution. With CNTYMEs, there is no compromise: high sensitivity,
high sampling frequency, and high temporal resolution can be achieved
simultaneously. Thus, using CNTYMEs would facilitate experiments that
are currently difficult to achieve, such as defining the time course
and amount of dopamine release from a single stimulation pulse. High
temporal resolution and the high sensitivity measurements at CNTYMEs
could also be used to monitor other electroactive neurotransmitters
or examine the electrochemical kinetics of other electroactive molecules.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a carbon nanotube
yarn microelectrode
(CNTYME) capable of measuring changes in dopamine at the 2-ms time
scale with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV), which is nearly 2
orders of magnitude faster than traditional FSCV measurement rates
at carbon-fiber microelectrodes (CFMEs). FSCV at CNTYMEs is comparable
to the time scale of measurements using constant potential amperometry.
Carbon nanotube (CNT) yarns are an ideal microelectrode material because
they are commercially available, have high sensitivity, and have a
dopamine oxidation current that is independent of the repetition rate
with FSCV. CNTYMEs will be useful for high temporal resolution measurements
of neurotransmitters and for monitoring reaction intermediates and
kinetic studies of other compounds using FSCV.
