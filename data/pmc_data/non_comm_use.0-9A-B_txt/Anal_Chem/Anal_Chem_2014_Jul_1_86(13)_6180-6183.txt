Quantitative polymerase chain reaction
is the current “golden
standard” for quantification of nucleic acids; however, its
utility is constrained by an inability to easily and reliably detect
multiple targets in a single reaction. We have successfully overcome
this problem with a novel combination of two widely used approaches:
target-specific multiplex amplification with 15 cycles of polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), followed by single-molecule detection of amplicons
with atomic force microscopy (AFM). In test experiments comparing
the relative expression of ten transcripts in two different human
total RNA samples, we find good agreement between our single reaction,
multiplexed PCR/AFM data, and data from 20 individual singleplex quantitative
PCR reactions. This technique can be applied to virtually any analytical
problem requiring sensitive measurement concentrations of multiple
nucleic acid targets.

==== Body
High-throughput
transcriptomic
assays, such as microarrays or RNA-Seq, allow identification of gene
expression signatures consisting of hundreds-to-thousands of genes.
However, these high-throughput techniques are costly and time-consuming
(turnaround time one-to-several days), need centralized processing
in many cases, and are not very sensitive in terms of the amount of
input material.1,2 For example, the hybridization-based,
nCounter System requires ∼100 ng of input total RNA for gene
expression studies, with a typical assay time of 16 h.3 In particular, assay sensitivity is becoming an important
figure of merit as interest grows in studying minute quantity samples,
such as needle biopsies, aspirates, and circulating tumor cells (CTCs),4 rather than bulk tissue.5−7 At the same
time, there is no need to use cost- and time-intensive high-throughput
techniques in many situations where an assay of several-to-tens of
genes will suffice, such as in the case of established biomarker panels.8−11

Real time-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is the golden standard
for gene expression-based biomarker assays, due to its sensitivity
(single-molecule in the ideal case) and broad dynamic range. However,
traditional qPCR is difficult to multiplex, and as a result, multitarget
experiments require many single reactions to be conducted in parallel,
either in microplate format or in the case of limited-quantity samples,
using preamplification and proprietary microfluidic platforms; both
approaches which add substantial cost, time, and complexity to the
analysis.12,13 Multiplexing standard PCR is problematic
because target sequences are typically amplified nonuniformly, which
results in misrepresentation of low-abundance and/or “difficult”
amplicons due to the depletion of reagents (dNTP and primers) and
inhibition of polymerase by amplicons;14 another problem is off-target primer binding and primer dimer formation,
for which the probability grows as the number of primer pairs in multiplex
increases; note that both these effects accumulate over a reaction
time course and result in artifacts at a high number of cycles.

To achieve simple and effective multiplexing of targets in one
qPCR reaction, we have combined low-cycle-number (<15 cycles),
target-specific multiplex amplification with single-molecule amplicon
detection using atomic force microscopy (AFM). By limiting the number
of PCR cycles, we seek to avoid the differential amplification distortion
present in normal qPCR, which in most cases requires 30+ amplification
cycles. We distinguish amplicons by their sizes, and given the high
sizing precision achievable with AFM, typically <3% CV,15,16 up to tens of targets can be discriminated simultaneously. Because
individual amplicons are easily detected by AFM, our approach has
orders of magnitude higher sensitivity (1000×) compared to bulk
fluorescent techniques such as microarray and capillary electrophoresis;
further, no fluorescent dyes or any other types of labeling are used,
thus reducing the complexity and cost of the analysis.

We demonstrate
the technique by measuring the relative expression
level of ten human genes in two different total RNA samples and find
a high concordance between single-reaction multiplex PCR/AFM data
and data obtained from a panel of 20 independent singleplex qPCR assays.
Aside from transcriptional profiling, this technique could be used
to quantify multiple nucleic acids targets in other assays where molecular
concentration is relevant, such as in studies of genomic copy number
variation, mRNA isoform detection, and analysis of chromosomal translocations.

Results
and Discussion
Multiplex PCR
Ten human genes (see
Table S1, Supporting Information) were
chosen as a model
biomarker panel; we measured the difference in expression of transcripts
in this panel between two commercially available total RNA samples:
Universal Total Human Reference RNA (Stratagene) and FirstChoice Human
Brain Reference RNA (Life Technologies). To verify that all ten genes
could be coamplified in the same reaction, 30 cycles of multiplex
RT-PCR were conducted at primer concentrations listed in Table S1, Supporting Information, using both total RNA
samples, and separated in 1% agarose gel (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The Agilent Bioanalyzer DNA high-sensitivity
kit was used to quantify the multiplex PCR after 15 amplification
cycles (Figure 1).

amplicons (1 μL, conc. 800 pg/μL) compared to (b) size
distribution of amplicons measured with AFM (est. ∼1 μL,
conc. 10 pg/μL; 2500 molecules). Note that the AFM-determined
amplicon sizes are plotted on a logarithmic scale for comparison purposes.

and (d) AFM (10 pg/μL; 1500 molecules).

AFM Imaging
We used APS-treated mica surfaces to bind
DNA molecules for AFM imaging.17 Note that
we did not purify mRNA from total RNA and used oligo(dT) reverse transcription
primers for simplicity, so the solution after PCR contains, in addition
to amplicons, genomic DNA contamination, rRNA, all mRNAs, and cDNAs.
However, as it can be seen on the AFM image depicted in Figure 2, the most abundant species on mica surface are
amplicon molecules, distinguishable from the other reaction constituents
by length, height, and persistence length.

Figure 2 (a) 10 × 10 μm
AFM image of 10plex RT-PCR products (15
amplification cycles) produced using Universal Total Human Reference
RNA as a template. (b) First inset shows various PCR amplicons highlighted
in white with their associated backbone contour measurements. (c)
Second inset shows individual amplicons classified by species. Note
that background objects are not identified as amplicons due to their
nonlinear shape (∗ and ∗∗) or because they were
shorter than the smallest expected amplicon (∗∗∗).

Using PCR/AFM, we were able to
reliably detect amplicons after
15 cycles (Figure 3), which is lower than qPCR
Ct values at comparable amounts of initial cDNA (see qPCR data in
Table S2, Supporting Information). In fact,
there is a balance in choosing the number of PCR cycles: too few may
result in decreased specificity and insufficient amount of amplicons,
while too many will distort the initial distribution of nucleic acid
targets; so, the number of cycles should be optimized for each assay.
Here, we used unmodified primers and amplicons. Labeling of primers
at their 5′-end with AFM-detectable labels, such as streptavaidin
or other proteins, or nanoparticles, can increase the level of multiplexing
at least by a factor of 2-fold (20 targets). Previously, we have shown
that sequence-specific labeling can be used to identify individual
transcripts in a complex mixture containing several thousand distinct
species.15 Sequence-specific labeling of
amplicons could not only increase the level of multiplexing but also
allow for detection of genetic variations within the amplicons in
cases where the amplicon length is detectably altered. In order to
minimize the number of steps of our protocol, we used total RNA without
enzymatic digestion of remaining genomic DNA and purification of mRNA.
Although silica column-based purification allows for specific purification
of dsDNA amplicons and elimination of almost all of the ssRNA and
ssDNA, the elution volume for a typical column is 6–10 μL.
However, 0.1 μL or even less is required for deposition on the
mica surface. Using advanced
DNA purification techniques, such as purification by electric field,18−21 we can potentially increase the sensitivity of this assay by 100×.

Figure 3 Relative
expression of target mRNAs in brain vs human reference
total RNA. The relative abundance of each target is determined by
AFM (y-axis) vs qPCR (x-axis). Error
bars represent the estimated standard error of measurement for qPCR
and PCR + AFM. The robust linear least-squares fit is indicated by
the solid black line, y = −0.14 + 0.60x, and the dotted black lines represent ±0.5 log2 from the fit. The linear model fits the data well (R2 of the fit is 0.87), indicating that the AFM
data is a good predictor of the qPCR measurements. Dispersion of the
data about the fit vs qPCR, given by the root mean squared error (RMSE),
is 0.87 log2 units. Note that MMP2 is the only gene where
the difference in Ct value for Human Reference and Brain sample is
more than 10 log2 units at 60 °C (see Table S2, Supporting Information). This fact can be an
indicator for the limits of dynamic range for AFM-based PCR using
1000–2000 molecules; increasing the number of analyzed molecules
will improve the dynamic range at the expense of throughput.

To determine the repeatability
of the PCR + AFM measurement, we
separately repeated the 10-plex measurements of Human Reference total
RNA, de novo, in triplicate (see Table S6, Supporting
Information). The median coefficient of variation (standard
error/mean) for the abundances of the ten targets was 0.25 (range
of 0.17–0.81). This compares to a median estimated lower limit
of error due to statistical counting noise of 0.18 (range of 0.05–0.38).
The counting error is a function of the sampling depth (number of
molecules counted per sample), and this type of error can be arbitrarily
reduced by collecting more molecule counts at the expense of throughput.
Note that qPCR itself has been shown to have a relative error (CV)
in the range of 0.10–0.25 across most of its dynamic range
(Ct values of 18–30; the majority of our qPCR measurements
had Ct values in this range). This data indicates that a 2-fold change
in gene expression would be detected in a single experiment in most
cases where the total number of molecule counts per species is similar
to that reported here. (See Supporting Information for further discussion of repeatability.)

This is an initial
study of applicability of PCR/AFM to analyze
“real” biological material derived from human cells.
We restricted ourselves to gene expression profiling of ten genes.
Undoubtedly, this technique can be applied to virtually any genetic
variation or a combination of genetic variation assayed in the same
tube. While the slow imaging rate of our general purpose AFM was a
practical constraint (∼25 h imaging time for 2 samples), if
a commercially available high scan rate AFM had been used (e.g., Bruker
FastScan or Asylum Cypher), the assay time would have been considerably
reduced, to 1.4 h or less, which is of similar duration as regular
30–35 cycle qPCR, and significantly more rapid than existing
hybridization-based detection schemes (14–16 h).1,3 We note that automated sample handling and image analysis can be
easily implemented using standard methods, as we and others have shown
previously,16,22 and that AFM technology has progressed
to the point that image capture rates can approach that of optical
microscopy.23−27 General purpose AFM instruments are commonly available in universities
and other research institutions. High scan speed (imaging rate approaching
1 frame per second) AFMs have been commercially available for several
years, are beginning to replace “standard” AFMs in the
installed base, and are often available in shared core facilities
as are quantitative PCR machines and DNA sequencing instruments; the
approximate retail price of a state of the art general purpose high
speed AFM is on the order of the former and much less than the latter.
However, the AFM + PCR method does not require many of the features
present in a general purpose AFM, such as complex z-axis feedback control and electronics supporting multiple imaging
modes (surface elasticity mapping, electric and magnetic imaging,
etc.); a suitable system can be assembled from commercially available
components for approximately $30,000.
