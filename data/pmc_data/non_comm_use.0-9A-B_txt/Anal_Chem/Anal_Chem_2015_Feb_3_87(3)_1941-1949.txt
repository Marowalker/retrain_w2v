Flow cytometry holds promise to accelerate
antibiotic susceptibility
determinations; however, without robust multidimensional statistical
analysis, general discrimination criteria have remained elusive. In
this study, a new statistical method, probability binning signature
quadratic form (PB-sQF), was developed and applied to analyze flow
cytometric data of bacterial responses to antibiotic exposure. Both
sensitive lab strains (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and a multidrug resistant, clinically
isolated strain (E. coli) were incubated with the
bacteria-targeted dye, maltohexaose-conjugated IR786, and each of
many bactericidal or bacteriostatic antibiotics to identify changes
induced around corresponding minimum inhibition concentrations (MIC).
The antibiotic-induced damages were monitored by flow cytometry after
1-h incubation through forward scatter, side scatter, and fluorescence
channels. The 3-dimensional differences between the flow cytometric
data of the no-antibiotic treated bacteria and the antibiotic-treated
bacteria were characterized by PB-sQF into a 1-dimensional linear
distance. A 99% confidence level was established by statistical bootstrapping
for each antibiotic-bacteria pair. For the susceptible E.
coli strain, statistically significant increments from this
99% confidence level were observed from 1/16x MIC to 1x MIC for all
the antibiotics. The same increments were recorded for P.
aeruginosa, which has been reported to cause difficulty in
flow-based viability tests. For the multidrug resistant E.
coli, significant distances from control samples were observed
only when an effective antibiotic treatment was utilized. Our results
suggest that a rapid and robust antimicrobial susceptibility test
(AST) can be constructed by statistically characterizing the differences
between sample and control flow cytometric populations, even in a
label-free scheme with scattered light alone. These distances vs paired
controls coupled with rigorous statistical confidence limits offer
a new path toward investigating initial biological responses, screening
for drugs, and shortening time to result in antimicrobial sensitivity
testing.

==== Body
The accelerating
emergence of
multidrug-resistant bacteria and difficulty in rapidly identifying
appropriate treatment options are major threats to global public health.1−4 The ability of bacteria to rapidly counter newly available antibiotics
within only a few years of clinical introduction has also produced
“super-bug” infections that are essentially untreatable.
Such rapid acquisition of resistance has also decreased both incentives
and options for new antibiotic development, with only two new antibiotics
having been approved since 2008.3,5 With 30% of hospital
deaths attributable to sepsis, bacterial infections of the blood have
become the 10th leading cause of hospital deaths in the US.6,7 Although rapidly tailored treatment to each individual patient can
have a major impact on positive outcome,8 currently, nearly 30% of patients receive inappropriate antimicrobial
therapy. Such nonideal treatment leads to 2-fold higher mortality
rates than when correctly treated9 and
also contributes to the increase in multidrug-resistance resulting
from sublethal antibiotic exposure.10,11 While rapid
initiation of appropriate treatment is crucial to positive patient
outcome, only combined knowledge of the pathogen identity and its
antibiotic sensitivity profile comprise actionable treatment information.
Recent advances that employ mass spectrometry and genetic tests12−16 enable identification of an infectious agent within a few hours
after positive blood culture. However, conventional antibiotic sensitivity
tests (ASTs) typically require overnight subculturing, followed by
an 18 to 24 h AST, resulting in a 42–48 h post blood culture
delay in susceptibility data. Thus, improving AST time-to-result would
have positive patient and public health outcomes.

In many ways
resulting from the inability to selectively target
bacteria in human specimens, ASTs typically rely on the lengthy process
of monitoring growth inhibition of pure cultures under antibiotic
challenge. Yet, much smaller antibiotic-induced changes in bacterial
cells are likely present long before growth inhibition is detected.
To amplify such potentially small changes present at shorter exposure
times, large numbers coupled with new multidimensional statistical
metrics are needed. Commonly applied in research laboratories for
viability testing,17,18 flow cytometry rapidly measures
multichannel fluorescence and scatter from each cell within a large
population, yielding large, multidimensional histograms ripe for quantitative
statistical analysis. Previously described cytometry-based ASTs mostly
rely on interpreting qualitative differences in live and dead cell
populations using high-background fluorescent membrane integrity/potential
sensors.19−28 Detection of label-free scattered light changes and intracellular
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in response to antibiotic
exposure have also been reported.29−32 While advances continue to be
made in instrumentation and miniaturization for analyzing bacterial
samples,33−37 high background, very large statistical variability, and insufficient
changes from controls make many cytometry-based bacteria/antibiotic
combinations appear unquantifiable.23,25,38 Thus, even with a large number of observations probing
antibiotic-induced changes within a given cell population, flow cytometic
ASTs fail from the lack of accurate statistical metrics to quantify
multidimensional changes relative to controls.

Ideally, the
dissimilarity between 2 distributions (sample vs control)
is quantified by various test statistics, yielding “distances”
between measured distributions. One-dimensional test statistics are
either too sensitive to provide meaningful analysis39,40 or required a large number of events40 and are usually not rigorously extensible to multidimensional data.
Adaptive binning overcomes the data set size and multidimensional
extensibility issues to focus analysis on the most informative regions
of the data;41,42 however, sample comparison is
control-specific in probability binned chi-square (PB-χ2) tests, making the test result unsuitable as a true (linear)
metric for directly comparing multiple samples. As a consequence,
it is difficult to adjust statistical tests for biological variability.
Various multidimensional distance metrics are known, but necessary
computational resources tend to scale with the number of bins raised
to some large power. Scaling quadratically with the number of bins,
quadratic form (QF) distance statistics directly addresses the metric
issue, providing a linear distance between any two multidimensional
data sets,43 but its reliance on fixed
bin sizes can limit its extension to multidimensional cytometry data
sets. Instead of comparing occurrences in fixed bins, adaptively binned
or “signature” QF (sQF) has been developed for image
analysis to directly compare signatures, or the most important features,
within images.44,45 We have combined the adaptive
probability binning with the signature QF distances to create a linear
statistical metric that more readily scales to multiple dimensions.
Combining the best attributes of PB-χ2 and sQF 2D
image analysis, our PB-sQF approach focuses binning on the high-density
regions of the data, better facilitating true distance comparisons
among multidimensional data sets.

Utilizing the fact that bacterial
uptake systems have broad substrate
specificities, Ning et al.46 recently reported
that bacteria can be selectively targeted through the maltodextrin
uptake pathway. In contrast to other technologies, fluorescently labeled
maltohexaose is selectively taken up by bacteria to reach mM intracellular
concentrations, without detectable mammalian cell uptake, both in vitro and in vivo.46 Such selective labeling offers a way to potentially identify
bacterial populations prior to time-consuming subculturing and growth.
Thus, using both label-free scattered light and selective bacterial
fluorescent labeling through the bacteria-selective maltodextrin metabolic
pathway, we have developed a framework for rapidly determining bacterial
antibiotic sensitivities. By specifically labeling bacteria with maltohexaose-conjugated
IR786 (MH-IR786), coupled with our development of an adaptively binned
multidimensional statistical metric combining the best attributes
of PB-χ2 adaptive binning41,42 and sQF image analysis,44,45 we develop a rapid,
quantitative flow cytometric approach to determine antibiotic sensitivities
even in difficult-to-determine antibiotic-bacterium combinations.

Experimental Section
Media and Antibiotics
E.
coli ATCC33456
and P. aeruginosa ATCC27853 were grown in Luria–Bertani
(LB) medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The resistant E. coli clinical isolate, Mu14S, was obtained from the Georgia
emerging infection program (GEIP). All antibiotics were obtained from
Sigma or as otherwise indicated. The E. coli (ATCC
33456) MICs for each antibiotic were measured to be 32 μg/mL
penicillin G, 0.125 μg/mL norfloxacin (Enzo Life Science, Farmingdale,
NY), 0.016 μg/mL ciprofloxacin, 8 μg/mL kanamycin (Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA), 1 μg/mL tetracycline, 150 μg/mL
erythromycin, 8 μg/mL azythromycin (TCI America, Portland, Oregon),
and 2 μg/mL gentamicin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The
MICs for the E. coli Mu14S strain were as follows:
4 μg/mL gentamicin, > 5000 μg/mL penicillin G, >
8 μg/mL
tetracycline. The P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) MICs
were as follows: 1024 μg/mL kanamycin, 512 μg/mL ampicillin,
16 μg/mL tetracycline, and 2 μg/mL norfloxacin.

Bacterial
Strains and Culture
Bacteria were cultured
overnight in an incubator shaker (MaxQ 4000, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA) in growth medium at 37 °C and 225 rpm. Bacteria
were then reinoculated in 12 mL of fresh LB medium in 50 mL tubes
and incubated from ∼0.05 optical density, judging from extinction
at 600 nm, to the mid log phase. For antibiotic susceptibility measured
by MH-IR786, bacteria in 1 mL of media were collected by centrifugation
(Centrifuge 5417R, Eppendorf) at 13,400 rpm for 3 min and transferred
into 12-well plates (Costar, New York, NY). Antibiotics at the specified
concentrations and 20 μL of MH-IR786 to achieve a final concentration
900 nM were added simultaneously. The 12-well plates were incubated
at 37 °C for 1 h (Isotemp standard incubator, Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA). Bacteria were again collected by centrifugation and
washed 3 times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA) and resuspended in 1 mL of PBS. The bacteria samples
were maintained on ice until flow cytometry and imaging.

Flow Cytometry
Bacteria samples were analyzed by a
BD LSR II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lake, NY) equipped
with a 14 mW, 488 nm solid-state coherent sapphire laser for the scatter
signal and a HeNe Laser (18 mW @ 633 nm) for IR786 detection. Samples
were gated by forward and side scatter, while a 750–810 nm
bandpass filter was used to collect the IR786 fluorescence signal.
Data were collected with FACSDiVa provided by BD. Further data analysis
and display were carried out with Matlab 2013b (Math Works). For each
data set, 100,000 bacterial detection events were collected.

PB-sQF
Test Statistics
The statistical tests were performed
in Matlab 2013b on an AMD phenom II X4 820 (2.80 GHz) machine, equipped
with 4 GB DDR3 RAM running MS Windows 7. Probability binning codes
were written to be equivalent to those described in published studies.41,42 In brief, probability binning bins the data into approximately equal
counts/bin by varying bin width. Binning is performed by calculating
the variance of each dimension, identifying the highest variance dimension,
and dividing data at the median into two new bins for the high variance
dimension. Data on the median are randomly assigned to daughter bins.
This process enabled all the bins to have similar counts. Both the
control and sample were binned in the same manner, and the centroids
and weights of each bin were calculated. The test statistics were
then calculated as described in sQF applications using these described
centroids and weights.44,45

The weight vector, which
represents the probability of data points falling into each bin (number
of events in each bin divided by the total number of events), includes
weights from the control and the sample as shown below:  

The subscripts indicate
whether the weights were taken from the
control (C) or the sample (S), and the superscripts indicate the bin
for which the weights are calculated. The total number of bins is
denoted by N. The negative sign in front of the sample
weights was used to make sure that subtraction would be carried out
between the control and sample data in the later steps to measure
the differences between the two. Although the terminology adopted
here is that utilized in sQF image analysis,44,45 these weights simply represent the different normalized histogram
bin counts of control and sample data sets used in standard quadratic
form analyses.43

The centroid vector
is calculated from the geometric median (or
“Geometric quantile”, see below) to represent multidimensional
median:  

The subscripts and superscripts are the same as in the weight
vector.
The centroids are then used to calculate the similarity matrix. We
defined the matrix elements at the ith row and the jth column, Aij, in the similarity matrix, A,
as  

The second term is the dissimilarity matrix with the numerator
denoting the Euclidean distance between centroids i and j. The denominator is the normalized factor
with Lmax indicating the maximum distance
in each dimension. Since we are dealing with the same dynamic range
in every dimension, the maximum distance for n dimensions is Lmax·√n. When the
two centroids are exactly the same, the numerator is 0, meaning no
dissimilarity exists. On the other hand, due to the normalization,
when the distance between two centroids equals the dynamic range (the
largest possible distance between two centroids), the dissimilarity
is 1, representing a full dissimilarity. The similarity matrix, which
is the logical opposite of the dissimilarity matrix, is 1 minus the
dissimilarity as shown above. The diagonal elements of the similarity
matrix are always 1, indicating that each centroid is most similar
to itself. The test statistics were calculated using the QF matrix
operation:  

WeightT is the transpose
of the Weight vector. The test
statistics of antibiotic-treated data were then normalized by the
99% confidence level of its paired control. In this paper, we calculated
the 3-dimentional test with 128 bins.

Confidence Level Estimation
The bootstrap method was
used to determine the 99% confidence level. The flow data of the no-antibiotic
control and the 1/16x data were treated as two mother distributions,
and 70 daughter distributions with the corresponding sample size,
ranging in bacterial counts from 4*(number of bins) to (8000 + minimum
sample size) with step size 400, were subsampled from each mother
distribution. These distributions were then binned, and the PB-sQF
protocol was followed to calculate the test statistics. For each sample
size, test statistics were calculated between all 70 of the no-antibiotic
control subdistributions and all 70 of the 1/16x data subdistributions.
The distance measurements between all pairs of control-1/16x MIC daughter
distributions yield a distribution of test statistics values, resulting
from random subsampling from the mother distributions (biological
variability). The 99% confidence level of all the test statistics
at each sample size can be determined. The distance corresponding
to the confidence level decreased as the subsample size increased
and can be fit by an equation similar to the standard error of the
sample mean: Conf(n) = a0 + a1/√n, where Conf is the 99% confidence level value, n is the sample size, and a0 and a1 are the fitting parameters (Figure S6C). Here, a0 is the unknown confidence
level of the population. According to central limit theorem, the test
statistics distribution of the subdistributions should approximate
a Gaussian distribution at large sample size. Thus, the uncertainty
(standard error) in estimating the population’s confidence
level should follow a1/√n. The observed confidence
level then decreases with the inverse square root of the number of
data points. As subsample size increases, the deviations become smaller
and the estimation converges to the population confidence level. From
the fitting, we can then estimate the 99% confidence level of the
mother distribution with a sample size, n = 100,000.

Error Bar Determination
The error bars in the test
statistics bar charts combine two different uncertainties. One results
from biological variability, while the other arises from the dispersion
of data points. Biological variability is estimated by the standard
deviation of the normalized test statistics of the triplicate data.
Errors from binning account for the uncertainty in accurately determining
the centroid position within each bin. Median absolute deviation (MAD)
is used to measure the dispersion of each bin since it is more robust
toward outliers compared to standard deviation. The MAD is calculated
as follows:  

That
is, it is the median of the absolute
distance between each data point, Xi,
and the centroid of each bin.53,54 The MAD can then be
used to estimate the standard deviation by  where
φ–1 is the inverse
of the cumulative distribution function or the quantile function.54 As a result, the standard deviation estimated
from MAD is the MAD divided by the 75% quantile, which was determined
from the geometric quantile. The uncertainty from each bin, σperbinMAD, was then
propagated to yield the final binning uncertainty for replica “i”, σibinning.

The binning uncertainty
from each replica was then pooled together
to estimate the variance of the unknown population, where all triplicate
data were presumably sampling from this same unknown population  in which k = 3, since we
have triplicate data. ni is the sample
size of each replica, which will be close to 100,000 data points (ni will be exactly 100,000 if
no gate is applied before analysis).

The errors from triplicate
data and from the binning process were
then propagated together to yield the final uncertainty.  

The error bars in the bar charts are
one standard deviation above
and below the test statistic value.

Geometric Quantiles
Geometric quantiles are applied
first in determining the centroid of each bin and second in estimating
the error from binning. The whole process uses the quasi-Newton method
to solve an unconstrained minimization problem. The target function
that we minimize here, as described by Chaudhuri55 is  in which n is the number
of data points in each bin; X⃗i is the data point; and Q⃗(m) is the quantile of the mth iteration; u = 2α – 1,
where α is the fractional quantile. For example, α = 0.5
if we are calculating median (50% quantile). The target function then
reduces to f(Q⃗(m) = ∑i=1n{|X⃗i – Q⃗(m)|}). The median is the Q that minimizes
the sum of distances between each data point to the median. When u is nonzero, the second term in the target function takes
the deviation from the median into account. Our initial guess, Q⃗(0), is the 1-D quantile in each dimension. Q⃗(1) is estimated using the following
equations:    in which s⃗(m) is the increment determined by the
first- and second-order
derivative of the target function at the current iteration. For each
step, we need to examine whether f(Q⃗(m+1)) < f(Q⃗(m)). If not, we need
to choose a better Q⃗(m+1).56

The iteration stops
when either (1) the iteration has been carried out 50 times, with
incremental change, δ ≤ s⃗(m), or (2) the relative gradient in Q is smaller than the stopping criteria we set. The relative
gradient is  

In this work, the
iteration was stopped when relgrad(Q) is smaller
than 10–4.

Results
Sample Preparation
and Data Collection
Bacterial strains
were incubated with 900 nM MH-IR786 and antibiotics at their respective
1x, 1/4x, and 1/16x MIC concentrations that were first determined
by standard microbroth dilution assays (Table 1). After 1-h incubation, bacteria were pelleted, washed 3 times,
and resuspended in PBS for cytometry analyses. Three major bactericidal
antibiotics classes, β-lactams (penicillin G and ampicillin),
quinolones (ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin), and aminoglycosides (kanamycin
and gentamicin) as well as bacteriostatic antibiotics (tetracycline,
erythromycin, and azithromycin) that target various biological processes
were examined with a total processing time of <4 h.

Fluorescence
and scatter signals upon antibiotic challenge were monitored by flow
cytometry. IR786 fluorescence, forward-scattered and side-scattered
light were all collected for each of 100,000 measured bacterial cells
per run, yielding 3-D histograms for each antibiotic concentration.
All experiments were performed in triplicate and compared to appropriate
paired no-antibiotic controls. Using the entire data set as the initial
“bin”, data were adaptively binned by splitting the
data in each bin at the median of the dimension of highest variance.
Each daughter bin was then similarly split at the median of its highest
variance dimension until the desired number of bins is achieved. Details
on this probability-binning algorithm are given in the Experimental Section. Test results were calculated between
each antibiotic data set and its paired control, the antibiotic-free,
MH-IR786-labeled bacterial data. A 99% confidence level was determined
by bootstrapping and was unique for each no-antibiotic control-1/16x
MIC sample pair (details in the Experimental Section). Test results for each bacterium/antibiotic combination were normalized
to its own 99% confidence distance, directly reporting on differences
between antibiotic-treated samples vs no-antibiotic paired controls.
These individually normalized test results, or “fold distances”
from each individual paired control, are then directly compared among
all antibiotic exposure data. Fold distances from paired controls
are plotted as averages of triplicates with standard deviations representing
biological variability and intrabin data dispersion (see the Experimental Section for more detail). Test results
were considered statistically distinguishable beyond error bars, allowing
identification of antibiotic-induced effects. Normalizing test results
by the 99% confidence level of each paired control, removes machine-to-machine
and day-to-day variations, facilitating direct comparisons.

Antibiotic-Induced
Changes in Susceptible E. coli
Data of E. coli (ATCC 33456) treated for
1-h with penicillin G, tetracycline, and kanamycin are shown in Figure 1 (Complete flow cytometry histograms with additional
antibiotics can be found in Figures S1 and S2). Upon penicillin G treatments at near MIC concentrations, both
scatter and fluorescence signals significantly shift (Figure 1A and 1D). Tetracycline,
a bacteriostatic antibiotic targeting the 30S subunit of the bacterial
ribosome, however, primarily altered only scatter signals relative
to the no-antibiotic control (Figure 1B vs 1E). Conversely, kanamycin, another drug targeting
the 30S ribosome, only induced very minor scatter changes, consistent
with prior reports with aminoglycoside antibiotics,30 but the fluorescence signal from MH-IR786 clearly increases
upon 1x MIC exposure (Figure 1C and 1F). Although MH-mediated dye uptake has been shown
to occur via the LamB transporter in E. coli,46 it is clear that MH-dye concentration further
increases upon near-MIC challenge with certain antibiotics. This provides
additional distance-based discrimination of antibiotic-challenged
bacteria vs paired controls. Thus, multidimensional statistical metrics
that combine both scatter and fluorescence are needed for generalizable,
quantitative differentiation of population changes relative to paired
controls.

Incorporating uncertainties arising from both biological
variability and intrabin data dispersion into PB-sQF (see the Experimental Section), all test results (Figure 1G) demonstrate statistically significant distances
of the 1x MIC data from that of the 1/16x MIC data, that is, beyond
the 99% confidence level. Clear trends and transitions occur for all
antibiotic/bacteria combinations with increasing antibiotic concentrations.
The tested antibiotics target a wide range of processes (DNA replication,
protein synthesis, or cell wall synthesis), yet, when using our multidimensional
statistical metric that reduces all differences to a single linear
distance from its paired control, all classes of antibiotics showed
discernible, statistically significant changes in flow cytometry signals.
Underpinning the flow cytometry/PB-sQF results, phase-contrast images
of E. coli show clear morphology changes resulting
from antibiotic treatment (Figure S3).
Note that the 99% confidence level, which was determined by the bootstrap
method of calculating the test statistics between the subsampling
daughter distributions of the no-antibiotic control and the 1/16x
MIC data at small sample size, accurately estimates the 99% confidence
level distance between the two mother distributions. Thus, distances
among all individually binned multidimensional histograms are reduced
to single linear distances relative to paired controls using our PB-sQF
distance metrics, enabling antibiotic sensitivities to be determined
after only 1-h exposures in comparison to overnight incubation in
standard ASTs.

Cytometric Susceptibility Analysis of a Resistant E.
coli Clinical Isolate
To evaluate the antibiotic-induced
changes in resistant strains, we examined a multidrug resistant, clinically
isolated E. coli, Mu14S. Mu14S was susceptible to
gentamicin but was highly resistant to all other tested antibiotics
(Table 1). We examined both the laboratory
strain (ATCC 33456) and Mu14S with penicillin G, tetracycline, and
gentamicin in parallel. Consistent with the data shown in Figure 1, incubation with penicillin G at 1x MIC of ATCC33456
strain clearly shifts its scatter and fluorescence distributions (Figures 2A and S4) while not affecting
those of the resistant clinical strain Mu14S (Figures 2D and S4). The 3D data (forward
scatter, side scatter, and fluorescence) from both strains were quantified
with PB-sQF (Figure 2G). Analysis confirmed
that penicillin G was effective toward ATCC with both 1/4x and 1x
MIC extending above the 1/16x–no-antibiotic, 99% confidence
level, while all Mu14S results were below the 99% confidence level,
indicating that PB-sQF registers no significant changes at these concentrations.
On the other hand, while tetracycline induced scatter changes in ATCC33456
(Figure 2B) without clear fluorescence shifts
(Figure S4), neither scatter nor fluorescence
signals shifted upon tetracycline exposure in Mu14S strain (Figures 2E and S4). The PB-sQF
results confirmed the ATCC33456 sensitivity and Mu14S resistance toward
tetracycline (Figure 2H).

The MICs for
ATCC33456 and Mu14S of gentamicin are 2 μg/mL and 4 μg/mL,
respectively. Both strains were incubated with gentamicin at the MIC
of Mu14S. Gentamicin induced very little scatter and fluorescence
shifts in either strain (Figures 2C, 2F, S4). However, our
improved statistical metrics enable accurate quantification of these
small differences (Figure 2I). Even with triplicate
and centroid uncertainties, the test results registered significant
changes from 1/4 μg/mL to 4 μg/mL for both strains, confirming
the microbiological report, but with only 1-h exposure.

P. aeruginosa Characterized by Flow Cytometry
and PB-sQF
Previous studies have shown that P. aeruginosa strains are particularly difficult test cases with most antibiotics
in which bacterial viability tests routinely fail.25 For P. aeruginosa, this was explained
by its outer membrane interaction with the dye propidium iodide (PI),
yielding too high a background. Thus, we applied our 3D PB-sQF to P. aeruginosa using four different antibiotics. Using PB-sQF, P. aeruginosa exhibits readily distinguished sample-control
distances analogous to those in E. coli, upon near
MIC exposure to the same antibiotics (Figure 3 and Figure S5). In the fluorescence data
(Figure 3B and Figure S5), it is clear that a single threshold is difficult to establish
without any false positive or false negative counts since the control
curve significantly overlaps the antibiotic-treated distributions.
By directly comparing the whole data set, PB-sQF removes the need
for artificial thresholds, enabling quantitative comparisons.

Discussion
Historically, specific bacteria/antibiotic
combinations have been
especially difficult to assay with flow cytometric scatter or viability
testing. For example, ciprofloxacin with E. coli,23 tetracycline, and norfloxacin with several bacterial
species and most antibiotics with P. aeruginosa are
particularly difficult test cases in which bacterial viability tests
routinely fail.25 Using our 3D PB-sQF,
we have demonstrated not only the difficult-to-determine E.
coli sensitivity to either ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, or
norfloxacin (Figure 1) but also that P. aeruginosa exhibits readily distinguished sample-control
distances similar to those in E. coli, upon near
MIC exposure to antibiotics.

Due to the large possible signal
shifts, fluorescence-based viability
tests are typically preferred over scattered light signals in flow
cytometry. Frequently, only weakly quantitative distribution averages
and standard deviations or intensity ratios are used to qualitatively
discern differences among samples, instead of using appropriate multidimensional
statistical tests with paired controls.22,23,25,28,29,47,48 This lack of statistical rigor has prevented antibiotic susceptibility
of many bacteria/antibiotic combinations from being determinable with
rapid cytometric methods. The quantitative PB-χ2 methods41,42 from which we have adapted our binning methods have been a significant
advance in analysis. However, sample differences do not yield linear
distances from calculated test statistics, suggesting that PB-χ2 is not a statistical metric and preventing all samples from
being directly compared on the same distance axis. This was confirmed
in our studies as we increased the differences between the data and
sample, a linear increase was not obtained in the test value (Figure S6A). Thus, test results between subdistributions
could not be directly aligned on the same scale, clouding direct comparisons
to paired controls. Although for data with larger PB-χ2 test statistics vs the same control with the same binning pattern,
greater test statistic differences indicate smaller similarity with
the control. However, not knowing the response curve, it precludes
knowing how different the two data sets actually
are. Further, since all the data all must be binned according to the
control binning pattern, the response curves might possess different
curvature when different controls are used. Confounding comparisons
among data from different days or machines, this control-dependent
property might also contribute to error in test statistics when triplicate
(or more) data with their own paired-control are considered. Nonetheless,
our bootstrap method can also be applied to PB-χ2, and a 99% confidence level can be determined from fitting (Figure S6B). This 99% confidence level can be
used as a threshold, and a similar bar chart regarding antibiotic
susceptibility can be created. Although the fold distance is less
meaningful here, a similar AST can still be built. PB-sQF directly
circumvents these problems by combining the linear aspect of QF statistics
with probability binning to better interpret the flow cytometry data,
each with its own optimal binning.

Flow cytometry data are most
typically qualitatively analyzed by
setting artificial thresholds using either membrane potential or membrane
permeability dyes.25,28,47 Usually applicable only to 1-D data, statistical methods employed
in flow scale quadratically or faster with the number of bins and
either subject to specific binning pattern and/or cannot be scaled
to multidimensional data sets.39,40 PB-sQF scales quadratically
with the number of bins, which are concentrated around the data signatures
due to the adaptive binning process. The linear distance among bin
centroids and comparisons to paired controls removes machine-specific
variabilities, while biological variations can be quantitatively incorporated.
In PB-sQF, a statistical threshold is easily established by bootstrapping
without any assumption of the data distributions. Test results can
be normalized by this statistical threshold so data from different
machines or collected on different days can be compared directly in
a “fold distance” fashion. PB-sQF is a new, robust statistical
metric exhibiting more advantageous scaling to multiple dimensions
than even QF, as it requires fewer bins in each dimension–naturally
adapting to where the data points cluster (the signatures). Each data
set is adaptively binned, and the distance between signatures or binning
patterns is directly calculated and can be directly compared for each
multidimensional histogram, thereby enabling direct comparisons of
sample with paired negative controls for excellent discrimination
of differences in response to antibiotic concentrations.

As
maltohexaose conjugates are believed to be incorporated into
bacteria via active uptake processes,46,49 shifts in
MH-targeted fluorescence signals likely indicate changes in bacterial
physiological status. Forward and side scatter, however, provide label-free
measurements that largely reflect cell size/morphology and internal
cellular structure/granularity, respectively.50 Indeed, images of bacteria at near-MIC antibiotic levels are often
elongated relative to those without antibiotic present (Figure S3). Also, antibiotic-induced filamentation
has been observed to result from exposure to β-lactam,21,51 quinoline,21,29 and bacteriostatic52 antibiotics. Although it is not clear how these
antibiotics, with different primary targets, uniformly induce changes
in morphology and/or physiology, their changes in flow data from no-antibiotic
controls appear to be generally correlated with antibiotic sensitivity
levels.

Conclusion
By analyzing bacterial flow cytometry data
after only 1-h incubation,
the quantitative statistical metric, PB-sQF identifies the data signatures
and compares them by reducing multidimensional differences to a linear
distance between antibiotic-treated data and paired no-antibiotic
controls. With rigorous uncertainties incorporated, subtle, but biologically
relevant, antibiotic-induced changes become directly quantifiable,
even as these antibiotics target widely varying biological pathways
including DNA replication, protein synthesis, or cell wall synthesis.32 Thus, scattered light and bacteria-targeted
fluorescence, coupled with new statistical metrics, appear to more
generally enable rapid flow cytometry signal changes to gauge antibiotic
resistance over a wide range of bacteria/antibiotic combinations.
Even very difficult to discern combinations that fail with viability
tests are readily distinguished with our statistical measures that
are scalable to multiparameter measurements.

With potential
to improve patient outcomes through shortening the
window during which empiric antibiotic treatment is the only recourse,
flow-based antibiotic sensitivity determination suggests a >10-fold
reduction in post blood culture time to result (∼42 h to ∼4
h). As antibiotic susceptibilities and resistance proliferation are
of great concern, these results suggest a path toward more effective
and timely treatment. As time to treatment is a major determinant
of positive patient outcome, the strong correlation of sample-control
distance in combined scatter and fluorescence shifts with antibiotic
sensitivity strongly suggests that general criterion can be established
for developing robust flow cytometric based, rapid ASTs.
