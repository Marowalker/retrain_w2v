Phosphorylation of cellular components
catalyzed by kinases plays
important roles in cell signaling and proliferation. Quantitative
assessment of perturbation in global kinome may provide crucial knowledge
for elucidating the mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effects of
environmental toxicants. Here, we utilized an adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) affinity probe coupled with stable isotope labeling by amino
acids in cell culture (SILAC) to assess quantitatively the arsenite-induced
alteration of global kinome in human cells. We constructed a SILAC-compatible
kinome library for scheduled multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) analysis
and adopted on-the-fly recalibration of retention time shift, which
provided better throughput of the analytical method and enabled the
simultaneous quantification of the expression of ∼300 kinases
in two LC-MRM runs. With this improved analytical method, we conducted
an in-depth quantitative analysis of the perturbation of kinome of
GM00637 human skin fibroblast cells induced by arsenite exposure.
Several kinases involved in cell cycle progression, including cyclin-dependent
kinases (CDK1 and CDK4) and Aurora kinases A, B, and C, were found
to be hyperactivated, and the altered expression of CDK1 was further
validated by Western analysis. In addition, treatment with a CDK inhibitor,
flavopiridol, partially restored the arsenite-induced growth inhibition
of human skin fibroblast cells. Thus, sodium arsenite may confer its
cytotoxic effect partly through the aberrant activation of CDKs and
the resultant perturbation of cell cycle progression. Together, we
developed a high-throughput, SILAC-compatible, and MRM-based kinome
profiling method and demonstrated that the method is powerful in deciphering
the molecular modes of action of a widespread environmental toxicant.
The method should be generally applicable for uncovering the cellular
pathways triggered by other extracellular stimuli.

==== Body
As one of
the most important
family of enzymes, kinases are extensively engaged in numerous cellular
pathways, from metabolism to signal transduction.1 The kinase-mediated phosphorylation of proteins, lipids,
and carbohydrates controls the activation/deactivation, cellular localization,
binding affinity, and degradation of the substrate molecules.2 Thus, regulation of the function and localization
of kinases is the foundation to maintain proper cell proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis, while aberrant regulation of kinases
may lead to the induction of diseases and development of tumors.3 Along this line, the perturbation of the cellular
phosphorylation pattern by modulating kinases is one of the primary
deleterious effects exerted by environmental toxicants.4 Thus, a thorough assessment of the alterations
of the expression and activity of the entire kinome, which refers
to the collection of global kinases, is vital for understanding the
modes of action of various environmental toxicants and for exploiting
effective therapeutic interventions against toxicant exposure.

Efforts have been made into exploring effective strategies to interrogate
the expression and activation of kinases. Conventional immunoanalysis
with kinase/phospho-specific antibodies or peptide chips has provided
information on the regulation and enzymatic activities of individual
or specific groups of kinases.5,6 However, these strategies
are restricted by the specificity and availability of kinase antibodies
or substrates. Recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS) instrumentation,
along with the development of bioinformatic tools, have led to great
success in the identification and quantification of global proteome
and phosphoproteome.7,8 However, since kinases are of
relatively low abundance, interference from highly abundant proteins
hampers the detection of kinases, rendering the studies of global
kinome by MS very challenging. Therefore, it would be highly beneficial
to apply efficient kinase enrichment steps prior to MS analysis. To
this end, the kinase inhibitor-based enrichment method9 and biotin-conjugated acyl nucleotide probe affinity assay,10,11 coupled with LC-MS/MS analysis in the data-dependent acquisition
(DDA) mode, have facilitated high-throughput characterizations of
the global kinome from whole cell lysates or tissue extracts. However,
in the DDA mode, where 10–20 of the most abundant precursor
ions are selected for fragmentation to achieve peptide identification,12 the sensitivity and reproducibility for kinase
discovery is limited by the complexity of samples and variations in
precursor ion selection. Recently, with the application of the triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer and advances in software development
for multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) analysis,13,14 a targeted quantification method has gained advantages over the
above-mentioned discovery-based approach in terms of sensitivity,
quantification accuracy, and reproducibility.15

We recently constructed an MRM kinome library consisting of
∼400
strictly selected peptides representing more than 300 unique kinases
based on data acquired in DDA mode on an LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer.13 With the use of the MRM kinome library, together
with the application of a desthiobiotin-based isotope-coded adenosine
triphosphate (ATP)-affinity probe (ICAP) for kinase labeling, kinase
peptide enrichment, and LC-MS/MS analysis on a triple quadrupole mass
spectrometer, we were able to reproducibly identify and quantify more
than ∼250 protein and lipid kinases in cancer cells and tissues.13 In this highly multiplexed detection, it is
essential to perform scheduled MRM analysis where the mass spectrometer
is programmed to detect only a limited number of peptides in predefined
retention time windows. To achieve that, we calculated the “iRT”
score16 for each targeted kinase peptide
to accurately predict its retention time in scheduled MRM analysis.
In our previous workflow, the global kinome profiling was achieved
by monitoring ∼2000 transitions in 4 LC-MRM runs with the duration
of retention time window being set at 10 min. We used a relatively
wide retention time window in our previous study mainly due to the
observed retention time shift between sequential LC-MS/MS runs; although
the elution order of peptides strictly follows the iRT scales, a systematic
retention time shift of peptides was observed possibly due to sample
loading. To correct for retention time shift, here, we adopted “on-the-fly”
recalibration16,17 of retention time shift with
spiked-in reference peptides in the targeted kinome analysis. With
the increased accuracy in retention time prediction, we were able
to shorten the retention time window of our scheduled MRM analysis
to 6 min, thereby enabling the monitoring of the same number of transitions
within two LC-MS/MS runs without compromising the overall analytical
performance.

By coupling stable isotope labeling by amino acids
in cell culture
(SILAC)18−20 with the ATP-affinity probe in the targeted quantitative
kinome analysis for the first time, we achieved an in-depth analysis
of inorganic As(III)-induced global kinome perturbation in GM00637
human skin fibroblasts. We were able to quantify 234 kinases from
one forward and two reverse SILAC labeling experiments. Among them,
8 and 9 kinases were found to be significantly decreased and increased,
respectively, in protein expression level and ATP binding activity.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about the investigation
of global human kinome response under exposure to an environmental
toxicant. Moreover, we demonstrated that the targeted MRM-based kinome
analysis is amenable to both chemical and metabolic labeling and is
a powerful tool in the exploration of the disturbance in cellular
signaling network after external stimuli.

Methods
Cell Culture
All reagents unless otherwise stated were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). GM00637 human skin fibroblasts
were kindly provided by Prof. Gerd P. Pfeifer (the City of Hope) and
cultured at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Media (DMEM, ATCC,
Manassas, VA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic
solution (Life Technologies).

The MTT assay was performed using
Cell Proliferation Kit 1 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) as previously
described.21 For metabolic labeling using
SILAC, GM00637 cells were cultured in DMEM media for SILAC (DMEM media
minus l-lysine and l-arginine, Thermo Scientific,
Waltham, MA), supplemented with light lysine and arginine, or heavy
stable isotope-labeled [13C6,15N2]-l-lysine and [13C6]-l-arginine, following previously published procedures.22 SILAC GM00637 cells were maintained under the
same conditions as noted above, except that dialyzed FBS (Life Technologies)
was used. The cells were cultured in the heavy or light medium for
at least five passages prior to arsenite exposure to ensure nearly
complete incorporation of the stable isotope-labeled amino acids.

Sodium Arsenite Treatment and Cell Lysis
After SILAC
labeling, light and heavy-labeled GM00637 cells at a density of ∼5
× 105 cells/mL were treated with 5 μM sodium
arsenite [iAs(III)] for 24 h without dialyzed FBS in forward and reverse
SILAC labeling experiments, respectively. Cells were then harvested
with trypsin-EDTA solution (ATCC) and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) for three times. The pelleted cells were lysed with 0.7%
CHAPS in a solution containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5 mM EDTA,
100 mM NaCl, and a protease inhibitor cocktail (100:1). Supernatant
was then collected after centrifugation at 16 000g for 30 min, and the total protein concentration was determined by
a Bicinchoninic Acid Kit for Protein Determination. The light-labeled,
iAs(III)-treated cell lysate was mixed with the heavy-labeled, control
cell lysate at a 1:1 ratio (w/w) in the forward SILAC experiment.
In the reverse SILAC experiment, both the labeling and iAs(III) treatment
were reversed. The cell lysate mixture was further purified through
Illustra NAP-25 Columns (GM Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA)
to remove endogenous nucleotides.

ATP Affinity Probe Labeling
and Sample Preparation
The detailed procedures for ATP affinity
probe labeling, tryptic
digestion, and affinity purification of desthiobiotin-labeled peptides
were reported previously.13 Briefly, after
incubation with the ATP affinity probe for 2.5 h,11,23 the labeled cell lysate mixture was reduced with dithiothreitol,
alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with sequencing grade trypsin
(Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). The resultant desthiobiotin-labeled
peptides were enriched by using avidin–agarose resin and eluted
with a buffer containing 1% TFA in CH3CN/H2O
(7:3, v/v). The resulting enriched peptide samples were desalted by
employing OMIX C18 pipet tips (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA).

Scheduled LC-MRM Analysis and On-the-Fly
Correction of Retention
Time Shift
A TSQ Vantage triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) was utilized for the scheduled
LC-MRM analysis with on-the-fly correction for retention time (RT)
shift. The mass spectrometer was coupled to an EASY n-LCII HPLC system
with a nanoelectrospray ionization source (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
The experimental conditions for the scheduled LC-MRM analysis were
described elsewhere.13 To achieve on-the-fly
recalibration of retention time shift, standard reference peptides
(Pierce Peptide Retention Time Calibration Mixture, Thermo Fisher
Scientific) with pregenerated iRT values (Table S1, Supporting Information) were spiked into samples. In the process
of an LC-MRM run, the RT shift was evaluated on the basis of the RTs
of the reference peptides. The RT window of the subsequent peptides
was then adjusted in real time according to the linear regression
of the two preceding reference peptides. Thus, the improved accuracy
in RT prediction increased overall analytical robustness and allowed
for the use of a shortened RT window in the scheduled MRM analysis.
The retention time windows for the reference peptides (IGDYAGIK and
TASEFDSAIAQDK) and the remaining peptides were set up as 16 and 6
min, respectively. Therefore, the ∼2000 transitions corresponding
to ∼400 peptides from ∼300 kinases could be monitored
in two LC-MRM runs. Data were processed against the MRM-based kinome
library13 adapted for SILAC labeling on
Skyline, version 1.4.0.4421.14

Results
and Discussion
Quantitative Analysis of Global Kinome by
ATP Affinity Probe
with SILAC Labeling
Recently, we constructed a human MRM
kinome library on the basis of large-scale shotgun proteomic analysis
of kinases enriched by desthiobiotin-based isotope-coded ATP affinity
probes from the whole cell lysates of six different cell lines (K562,
IMR-90, HeLa-S3, Jurkat-T, WM-115, and WM-266-4).13 The acquired tandem mass spectra and retention time information
on kinase-derived peptides with desthiobiotin labeling were then processed
using Skyline for the MRM library construction. However, the use of
isotope-coded ATP affinity probes in the previous study required customized
synthesis, which may limit its general application in analytical laboratories.
To accommodate for a more widely used quantitative approach using
SILAC, we reconstructed the human MRM kinome library by setting up
variable modifications with mass shifts introduced by heavy isotope
labeling with lysine (+8 Da) and arginine (+6 Da). The current SILAC-compatible
MRM kinome library consists of 395 peptides, corresponding to 285
kinases, which allows for in-depth kinome profiling that covers all
the seven major human kinase families (Figure 1A).

Figure 1 Targeted human kinases mapped in the dendrogram of the SILAC-compatible
kinome library (A) and a general workflow of SILAC-based multiple
reaction monitoring (MRM) analysis for global kinome profiling using
the ATP affinity probe (B).

To achieve quantitative analysis of the global kinome, we
employed
metabolic labeling with SILAC (Figure 1B).
After complete incorporation of the light- and heavy-labeled amino
acids, the cells were exposed to sodium arsenite and subsequently
lysed. The light and heavy cell lysates were then incubated with ATP
affinity probe, mixed at a 1:1 ratio (w/w), and digested with trypsin.
After avidin agarose enrichment, the desthiobiotin-conjugated peptides
were eluted and subjected to scheduled LC-MRM analysis.

Our
results revealed that accurate MRM identification and quantification
of SILAC-labeled human kinome can be achieved by referring to the
spectra of targeted peptides in our SILAC-compatible MRM kinome library.
LC-MRM results of a representative peptide DIK*PQNLLLDPDTAVLK
(K* is desthiobiotin-labeled lysine) from glycogen synthase kinase-3
beta are depicted in Figure 2. On the basis
of the MS/MS in the kinome library obtained from data-dependent analysis,
transitions of three abundant y ions (y7, y8, and y9) were selected for MRM monitoring of light- and
heavy-labeled kinase peptides (Figure 2A).
Subsequent MRM analysis results revealed reliable monitoring of the
corresponding light and heavy forms of these three ions (Figure 2B,C). The relative abundances of the three y ions
from both light- and heavy-SILAC labeled kinase peptides were consistent
with those in the original spectrum in the library, confirming the
unbiased identification and quantification of this peptide. Therefore,
our MRM-based targeted kinome analysis is fully compatible with SILAC
labeling, thereby further broadening the application of this method
for global kinome profiling.

Scheduled MRM Analysis
with On-the-Fly Correction of Retention
Time Shift
To achieve large-scale global kinome analysis
for more than 300 kinases, it is essential to perform scheduled MRM
analysis, which necessitates accurate prediction of retention time.
In our previous workflow, we predicted the retention time for individual
peptides based on their empirically determined iRT scores.13 However, a wide variety of factors can give
rise to retention time variations. For example, sample loading, difference
in column packing, instabilities of LC systems, and mobile phase flow
rate can all lead to an unexpected shift in retention time, which
decreases the reproducibility and accuracy for quantification by scheduled
MRM analysis. In our previous experiment, although the targeted kinase
peptides follow strictly the elution order according to their iRT
scores, we also observed a 2–3 min delay in retention time
after multiple sample injections, which may result in the failure
of detecting some kinase peptides if a narrow detection window is
imposed in the scheduled MRM analysis.

To correct for systematic
retention time shift during the scheduled LC-MRM analysis, we incorporated
an on-the-fly correction16,17 in our MRM detection
workflow, during which the instrument automatically detects the shift
in retention time for predefined reference peptides and adjusts, in
real-time, the retention time window for subsequently eluted targeted
peptides. Since this recalibration of retention time occurred in real-time,
it could greatly reduce the chance of peak loss arising from the retention
time shift during scheduled MRM analysis. In our test experiment for
monitoring the tryptic digestion mixture of BSA, we found that peptides
with large retention time shift can still be successfully captured
with the on-the-fly technique. For instance, Figure 3A shows the chromatograms for two peptides (AEFVEVTK
and LGEYGFQNALIVR) from tryptic digestion mixture of BSA.
With an intentionally delayed gradient, the actual retention times
of these two peptides were postponed by 9 and 8 min, respectively,
from previous LC-MRM runs. Thus, without the on-the-fly correction
of retention time shift, the transitions of these two peptides would
not be captured in the predicted retention time window. However, using
the same detection windows, these two BSA peptides with very large
retention time shifts can still be successfully detected with the
real-time adjustment of the detection window. Therefore, the on-the-fly
technique is expected to easily correct for the retention time shift
observed in our kinome MRM analysis, which generally lies within the
2–3 min range.

mass spectrometer (C). (A) Extracted-ion chromatograms for two representative
BSA peptides AEFVEVTK and LGEYGFQNALIVR from two
LC-MRM analyses with different gradients. The traces acquired in the
initial and intentionally delayed gradients are shown in green and

window. (B) Number of transitions scheduled in each cycle with a 6
and 10 min retention time window, respectively. (C) iRT-based retention
time prediction achieved a good correlation with an R2 value of 0.999 on the measurement of 245 peptides with
a 130 min linear gradient.

To achieve on-the-fly recalibration of the retention time
shift
for our MRM-based kinome analysis, we spiked a set of commercially
available standard peptides into the sample.17 The iRT values of these reference peptides were also recalculated
by coinjection with tryptic peptides of BSA, whose iRT scores are
well-defined in the kinome library (Table S1, Supporting Information). In our experience, we found that
employing two reference peptides as retention time markers is sufficient
for systematic correction of retention time, whereas too many reference
peptides may adversely affect the real-time detection window adjustment
by the interference from complex sample matrices. In addition, the
early eluted standard peptides, which generally have large retention
time variations, were not employed as the reference peptides. Therefore,
we chose the third and fourth eluted standard peptides IGDYAGIK
and TASEFDSAIAQDK as the reference peptides for on-the-fly
corrections, and the detection time window was set at 16 min so that
no reference could be missed even with large retention time shift.
As a result, the detection window for subsequently eluted target peptides
will be adjusted according to a linear fit through the predicted and
actual RTs of reference peptides IGDYAGIK and TASEFDSAIAQDK.
Owing to this on-the-fly adjustment and the resultant increased accuracy
in retention time prediction, the duration of the retention time window
could be shortened from 10 min, as used in our previous study,13 to 6 min. As depicted in Figure 3B, for monitoring a total of more than 2000 transitions with
a 10 min scheduled retention time window, four LC-MRM analytical runs
are required since the maximum capacity for LC-MRM analysis is around
170 transitions per cycle. With a 6 min retention time window, the
MS was capable of monitoring the same number of transitions in 2 scheduled
LC-MRM runs. Thus, this method improved the analytical throughput,
reduced the amount of analyte required, and increased the analytical
robustness and accuracy.

Sodium Arsenite-Induced Perturbation of the
Entire Kinome
Previously, we utilized the isotope-coded ATP
affinity probes in
conjunction with the scheduled MRM analysis to achieve a comparative
analysis of the global kinome of a pair of melanoma cell lines derived
from the primary (WM-115) and metastatic (WM-266-4) tumor sites of
the same individual.13 However, this targeted
MRM analysis was not applied to study the global kinome response upon
external chemical stimulus, which has broad applications in research
in cell signaling and environmental toxicology. Therefore, in the
current study, we further expanded the application of this technique
to elucidate, with the use of an SILAC-based approach, the perturbation
of the entire kinome induced by an environmental toxicant, sodium
arsenite. In the same vein, exposure to arsenic species in drinking
water is a widespread public health concern worldwide. Researchers
from disparate fields have explored the mechanisms of action of arsenic
species from different perspectives, ranging from speciation to metabolism.24,25 Owing to the importance of kinases in cell signaling, we decided
to employ the MRM-based method to conduct an in-depth profiling of
the alteration of global kinome in human cells in response to sodium
arsenite exposure.

GM00637 human skin fibroblast cells were
treated with 5 μM sodium arsenite [iAs(III)] for 24 h. The subsequent
ATP affinity probe labeling and sample preparation were as described
in Figure 1B. The resulting enriched kinase
peptides were analyzed by two scheduled MRM runs with a 6 min retention
time window and on-the-fly retention time correction strategy. In
total, we quantified 234 kinases from one forward and two reverse
SILAC experiments (Table S3, Supporting Information). In addition, the excellent correlation between the measured retention
time with iRT demonstrated the effectiveness of this strategy (Figure 3C). Depicted in Figure 4 is
the histogram of kinome quantification results, which revealed that
kinases from all kinase groups except the PKL group were quantified.
Although the expression levels and ATP binding affinities of the majority
of the kinases in the kinome remained unchanged toward iAs(III) treatment,
8 and 9 kinases were significantly down- and up-regulated, respectively
(Figures 4 and S1 and S2 and Table S2, Supporting Information).

Figure 4 Global kinome profiling
for GM00637 human skin fibroblasts after
treatment with 5 μM sodium arsenite for 24 h. Blue and red bars
denote kinases that are down- and up-regulated after sodium arsenite
exposure, respectively.

It is worth discussing the analytical performances of the
MRM-based
kinome profiling method. As noted in our recent study,13 the MRM-based targeted proteomic approach affords
better sensitivity, reproducibility, and coverage for global kinome
analysis than the short-gun proteomic approach. In addition, we observed
that the MRM-based method provided an excellent dynamic range for
kinome quantification. Signal intensities, as reflected by peak areas
found in the selected-ion chromatograms for MRM transitions, vary
from 103 to 106 (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Thus, kinases with expression levels
differing by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude can be simultaneously monitored
and quantified. Second, to achieve high specificity in the MRM-based
kinome analysis, we chose only those kinase peptides that are directly
associated with ATP binding or possess known ATP-binding motifs (HRDxKxxN,
VAxK, or GxxxxGK) for the construction of the kinome MRM library.13 As a result, quantifications of the majority
of kinases were based on single unique peptides. Nevertheless, 66
out of the 234 kinases were quantified on the basis of multiple peptides.
Quantitative variations among the multiple unique peptides for any
of the 66 kinases are relatively small, as manifested by an average
relative standard deviation (RSD) of 12.6% (calculated on the basis
of data shown in Table S3, Supporting Information).

Sodium Arsenite Exposure Induced Hyperactivation of Cyclin-Dependent
Kinase 1 and Other Cell Cycle-Related Protein Kinases
Different
mechanisms were proposed about how arsenic species exert their cytotoxic
effects, which include induction of oxidative stress and dysfunction
of proteins through binding to vicinal thiol groups.26 Especially, cell cycle arrest induced by inorganic arsenic
exposure has been observed by multiple research groups.27

In the current study, we observed the
overexpression of multiple protein kinases associated with cell cycle
progression. For instance, we observed an elevated level of cyclin-dependent
kinase 1 (CDK1) in both forward and reverse SILAC experiments (ratio
of 2.07, Figures 5A and S2, Supporting Information). Along this line, our Western blot
analysis independently confirmed the increased expression of CDK1,
as illustrated in Figure 5B. In agreement with
our observation, cDNA microarray analysis also revealed the augmented
expression of CDK1 in sodium arsenite-treated HFW human fibroblast
cells.28

Figure 5 Sodium arsenite-induced elevated expression
of cyclin-dependent
kinase 1 (CDK1) (A, B) and arsenite-induced growth inhibition of cells
can be rescued by a CDK inhibitor, flavopiridol (C). (A) Quantitative
results by LC-MRM analysis for peptide DLK*PQNLLIDDK (“K*”
designates the desthiobiotin-labeled lysine) from CDK1. Shown are
the extracted-ion chromatograms for three transitions monitored for
the peptide with light (red) and heavy (blue) labels in forward (left)
and reverse (right) SILAC experiments. (B) Western blot analysis revealed
the elevated expression of CDK1 upon arsenite treatment. (C) The MTT
assay showed that flavopiridol could significantly restore the cell
proliferation rate after sodium arsenite treatment. “∗”, p < 0.05; “∗∗”, p < 0.01; “∗∗∗”, p < 0.001. The p values were calculated by using
an unpaired two-tailed t test. The values represent
the mean of results obtained from three independent experiments.

CDK1 plays pivotal roles in regulating
mammalian cell cycle progression,
which is an evolutionarily conserved and highly regulated process.
Sustained activation of CDK1 was found to arrest cells in the metaphase
and cause mitotic failure which eventually induces cell death.29 In this vein, hyperactivation of CDK1 was observed
to induce mitotic arrest in A375 leukemia cells after arsenite exposure.30 Thus, aberrant hyperactivation of CDK1 may account,
in part, for the cytotoxicity of sodium arsenite, and inhibition of
CDK1 may result in a decreased sensitivity toward sodium arsenite
exposure. To test this hypothesis, we cotreated GM00637 cells with
sodium arsenite and an effective CDK inhibitor, flavopiridol,31 and monitored the proliferation of the cells
using the MTT assay. Our results showed that treatment with flavopiridol
rescued in part the arsenite-induced growth inhibition (Figure 5C). Therefore, inhibition of CDK1 hyperactivities
could reduce the cytotoxicity of sodium arsenite in human skin fibroblasts.

Apart from CDK1, we found that arsenite exposure also led to the
up-regulation of several other kinases involved in cell cycle progression.
In this vein, we observed elevated levels of all three members of
Aurora kinases (AurA, AurB, and AurC) by 1.85-, 1.37-, and 1.68-fold,
respectively, following arsenite treatment. Aurora kinases play vital
roles in regulating cell cycle progression. Different members of Aurora
kinases possess distinct functions and subcellular localizations;
however, there is partial overlap and coordination of their functions.32 AurA is implicated in centrosome segregation
and spindle assembly, and it controls the transition between different
phases of the cell cycle, whereas AurB is involved in chromatin modification,
spindle checkpoint signaling, and cytokinesis.33,34 The function of AurC is ambiguous owing to the paucity of studies;
however, it may serve as a potential chromosomal passenger protein
as AurB and regulate spindle checkpoint.35 Overexpression of Aurora kinases has been linked to centrosome amplification,
multinuclei formation, and aneuploidy.36 The activation of individual Aurora kinases upon arsenite treatment
was observed previously. For example, AurA was found to be elevated
in immortalized keratinocytes upon treatment with a low dose (<1
μM) of arsenite.37 Likewise, AurB
was found to be increased in Hela-S3 cells upon exposure with arsenic
trioxide.38 Here, facilitated by this global
kinome analysis technique, we demonstrated unambiguously the global
elevated expression/activation for all three Aurora kinases upon arsenite
treatment, which may induce cell cycle dysregulation. Thus, the aberrant
expression and activation of cell cycle-related kinases and the ensuing
perturbation in mitotic progression may account, in part, for the
cytotoxic and carcinogenic effects of arsenite.

Conclusions
Maturation of the targeted proteomic approach provides a solid
foundation for global kinome profiling. By interrogating this important
family of enzymes, more information can be garnered on the details
of critical cellular processes, such as cell signaling and cell proliferation.
In the present study, a reactive ATP affinity probe, coupled with
SILAC labeling and scheduled MRM analysis, was harnessed for global
kinome profiling. By adopting “on-the-fly” recalibration
of retention time shift with “spiked-in” reference peptides
to the targeted kinome analysis, we were able to shorten the duration
of the retention time window from 10 to 6 min. In doing so, ∼2000
transitions of ∼400 kinase peptides can be monitored in two
LC-MRM runs without compromising the overall analytical performance.
By taking advantage of the above-described method, we achieved, for
the first time, an in-depth analysis of arsenic-induced global kinome
perturbation in GM00637 human skin fibroblasts. This further demonstrated
that the ATP affinity labeling method is amenable to both chemical
and metabolic labeling, and the method is also powerful for exploring
the disturbance in the cell signaling network in response to environmental
toxicant exposure.

A total of 245 unique peptides, representing
234 unique kinases,
was quantified from three independent SILAC experiments. Several kinases
involved in cell cycle progression were found to be hyperactivated.
Among them, the expression level of CDK1 was increased by ∼2-fold,
which was further confirmed by Western analysis. Additionally, treatment
with a CDK1 inhibitor, flavopiridol, could partly rescue the cells
from arsenite-induced growth inhibition. Thus, we reason that sodium
arsenite may exert its cytotoxic effect, in part, through aberrant
activation of CDK1 and the resultant disturbance of cell cycle progression.
In addition, other kinases involved in the mitotic progression, including
Aurora kinases, were found to be activated, which may give rise to
mitotic instability and, eventually, cell death. Together, the above
findings strongly support that MRM- and ATP affinity probe-based kinome
profiling constitutes a powerful tool for the discovery of molecular
mechanisms of action of environmental toxicants.
