Bottom-up
mass spectrometry-based proteomics utilizes proteolytic
enzymes with well characterized specificities to generate peptides
amenable for identification by high-throughput tandem mass spectrometry.
Trypsin, which cuts specifically after the basic residues lysine and
arginine, is the predominant enzyme used for proteome digestion, although
proteases with alternative specificities are required to detect sequences
that are not accessible after tryptic digest. Here, we show that the
human cysteine protease legumain exhibits a strict substrate specificity
for cleavage after asparagine and aspartic acid residues during in-solution
digestions of proteomes extracted from Escherichia
coli, mouse embryonic fibroblast cell cultures, and Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. Generating peptides
highly complementary in sequence, yet similar in their biophysical
properties, legumain (as compared to trypsin or GluC) enabled complementary
proteome and protein sequence coverage. Importantly, legumain further
enabled the identification and enrichment of protein N-termini not
accessible in GluC- or trypsin-digested samples. Legumain cannot cleave
after glycosylated Asn residues, which enabled the robust identification
and orthogonal validation of N-glycosylation sites based on alternating
sequential sample treatments with legumain and PNGaseF and vice versa.
Taken together, we demonstrate that legumain is a practical, efficient
protease for extending the proteome and sequence coverage achieved
with trypsin, with unique possibilities for the characterization of
post-translational modification sites.

==== Body
Current “bottom-up”
mass spectrometry-based proteomics, also termed shotgun proteomics,
can achieve near-complete proteome coverage and allows for extensive
mapping of post-translational modification sites.1 The basis of this approach is the selective protease-mediated
digestion of isolated proteomes into peptides, which are then typically
separated by reverse-phase liquid chromatography under acidic conditions
and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Peptides are subsequently
identified by computational matching of the acquired spectra to proteome
databases or spectral libraries, and the proteins present in the sample
are inferred on the basis of the identified peptides.2 The serine protease trypsin has become the dominant workhorse
for the proteome digestions due to its high cleavage efficiency, high
specificity for cleavage after Arg or Lys, and affordable price, even
for high-quality preparations.3 Proteomes
digested with trypsin therefore consist of predictable peptides with
a C-terminal basic residue favorable for the ionization and generation
of a dominant y-ion series, which facilitates database searches and
peptide identification. However, about half of the peptides generated
by trypsin are less than six residues long and therefore too small
for identification and/or unambiguous assignment to specific protein
sequences.4 Thus, many protein segments,
including critical post-translational modification sites, and even
whole proteins remain invisible in proteome analyses relying on trypsin
alone.3 This is especially true for proteolytic
processing, a site-specific post-translational protein modification
that can irreversibly alter protein function, interaction, and localization5,6 and thereby exert important signaling functions.7 Processed proteoforms are unambiguously identified by their
new protease-generated neo-N-, or C-termini.8,9 The
identification of neo-N-, and C-terminal peptides, which constitute
a minor fraction among all peptides in a proteome digest, is facilitated
by a variety of methods that have been developed to allow for their
selective enrichment.5 However, many neo-N-,
or C-terminal peptides are too short for mass spectrometry-based identification
when only a single protease is used.9

Alternative proteases with a high sequence specificity are therefore
of great interest and increasingly applied in bottom-up proteomics,
including termini profiling approaches.3,10 Established
proteases include AspN for cleavage before Asp and Glu; chymotrypsin
for cleavage after Phe, Tyr, Leu, Trp, and Met; GluC (also known as Staphyloccoccus aureus protease V8) for cleavage
after Asp and Glu; LysC for cleavage after Lys; LysN for cleavage
before Lys;3,11 LysargiNase for cleavage before
Arg and Lys;12 and the prolyl endopeptidase
neprosin that selectively cleaves after Pro and Ala.13 Also, proteases with broader sequence specificity such
as elastase and thermolysin,14 proteinase
K,15 subtilisin,16 and thermolysin WaLP and MaLP17 are occasionally
applied but less favored due to the increased sample complexity with
overlapping peptides and the less efficient spectrum-to-sequence matching
due to the lack of a defined cleavage specificity as a restraint.18 Notably, digest with a single additional protease
increases the number of protein identifications by an average of 7–8%11 and enables the discovery of critical PTMs including
phosphorylation sites16,19 and N-terminal processing sites10,20 that are missed in tryptic digests. Hence, there is a persistent
strong demand for new, highly specific proteolytic enzymes with improved,
complementary, or unexplored sequence specificity.3

Human legumain, also known as asparaginyl endopeptidase
(AEP),
is a well characterized caspase-like human cysteine protease known
to cleave model substrates selectively after Asn and Asp residues.21 Recently, legumain cleavage specificity was
further characterized by in-gel digestion of denatured complex proteomes
that revealed pH-dependent differences in sequence specificity, with
an optimal pH for cleavage after Asn and Asp at pH 6 and 4.5, respectively.22 On the basis of this data, it was further suggested
that legumain may be a suitable choice as a precision digestion enzyme
in proteomics applications.22 Encouraged
by these reports, we reasoned that legumain might also be an attractive
enzyme for standard in-solution digestion proteomics workflows. We
show that the parallel digestion of proteomes isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) leaves, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), or Escherichia
coli (E. coli) cell
cultures with legumain, trypsin, and GluC results in the identification
of distinct peptides that together increase protein sequence and proteome
coverage. Legumain retained its remarkable specificity even under
unfavorable conditions. N-terminome profiling demonstrated a strong
complementarity to trypsin and superior performance compared to that
of GluC. Asn is also the site of N-linked glycosylation, a common
protein post-translational modification important in protein stability,
folding, and protein–protein interaction.23 By sequential processing with PNGase F and legumain, and
vice versa, we demonstrate that N-glycosylation prevents legumain
cleavage and propose that this tandem treatment strategy can provide
orthogonal validation of N-glycosylation sites. Taken together, our
data demonstrate that legumain is an attractive and reliable protease
for the specific digestion of proteomes after Asn and Asp, with particular
advantages for PTM site identification including processed N-termini
and N-glycosylation sites.

Experimental Section
Expression, Purification,
and Activation of Human Legumain
Human legumain was produced
using the Leishmania
tarentolae expression system (LEXSY) following a previously
published protocol.24 Briefly, legumain
was recombinantly expressed as a secreted protein by a LEXSY suspension
culture at 26 °C. The supernatant containing prolegumain protein
was harvested by centrifugation and subjected to Ni2+-NTA
affinity purification, followed by desalting using PD-10 columns (GE
Healthcare). Purified legumain was activated at 20 °C in a buffer
containing 100 mM citric acid (pH 4.0), 100 mM NaCl, and 2 mM DTT.
The progress of autoactivation was monitored by SDS-PAGE. Activated
legumain was further purified using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare)
followed by size exclution chromatography to have the active protein
in a final buffer composed of 20 mM citric acid (pH 4.0), 50 mM NaCl,
and 2 mM DTT. Legumain activity was evaluated using the legumain specific
fluorescent substrate Z-Ala-Ala-Asn-AMC (AAN-AMC; Bachem) at a concentration
of 50 μM in assay buffer composed of 50 mM citric acid (pH 5.5),
100 mM NaCl, and 2 mM DTT at 37 °C. Fluorescence was detected
using an Infinite M200 Plate Reader (Tecan) at 460 nm after excitation
at 380 nm.

A. thaliana Proteome Preparation
A. thaliana Columbia (Col-8) leaves
were harvested from 10 week old plants grown on soil under short day
conditions (9 h/15 h photoperiod, 22 °C/18 °C, 120 μmol
of photons m–2 s–1) and snap frozen
in liquid nitrogen. Leaves were ground in liquid nitrogen and resuspended
in 10 mL/g fresh weight of extraction buffer (6 M Gua-HCl, 0.1 M HEPES
(pH 7.4), 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and HALT protease inhibitor cocktail;
ThermoFisher, Dreieich, Germany). The suspension was homogenized using
a Polytron PT-2500 (Kinematica, Luzern, Switzerland) and filtered
through Miracloth (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and debris and nuclei
were removed by centrifugation at 500g, 4 °C
for 10 min. Proteins in the supernatant were purified by chloroform–methanol
precipitation,25 resuspended in extraction
buffer, and reduced with 5 mM DTT at 56 °C, 30 min followed by
alkylation with 15 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at 25 °C. The
reaction was quenched by the addition of 15 mM DTT for 15 min. The
proteome extract was purified again with chloroform–methanol
precipitation, resuspended in 0.2 mL of 0.1 M NaOH, and diluted with
water and 1 M Hepes (pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 4 mg/mL in
0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.4). The protein concentration was quantified using
the BCA assay (ThermoFisher, Dreieich, Germany). For digestion, aliquots
of the concentrated A. thaliana proteome
extracts were diluted at least four times to reach the required digestion
buffer conditions, and the pH was confirmed with pH strips (Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany).

Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast Proteome Preparation
Mouse
embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were cultured in DMEM GlutaMax high
glucose (Gibco 61965-026) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1× penicillin/streptomycin
(Gibco 15140-122) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Once the cells
reached a confluency of up to 90%, the media were removed, washed
with warm PBS, and trypsinized (Gibco 25300-054). The trypsinized
cells were pelleted, washed twice with warm PBS to remove excess media,
and lysed with 1% SDS 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 1:50 (v/v)
protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma P8340). The sample was heated to
95 °C for 5 min, cooled, sonicated for 2 min, and heated again
to 95 °C for 5 min to shear DNA. The protein concentration was
measured, and 100 μg of protein was used for each proteome digestion.
Proteins were reduced with 10 mM DTT for 30 min at 37 °C and
alkylated by the addition of 50 mM chloroacetamide (CAA) and incubation
for 30 min at RT in the dark. The reaction was quenched by incubation
with 50 mM DTT for 20 min at room temperature (RT) before purification
with SP3 beads26 and elution in the required
digestion buffer.

E. coli Proteome
Preparation
E. coli Dh5α
cells were grown
in 200 mL of LB media until an optical density of OD600 nm of 0.7. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 400g for 15 min at 4 °C, washed by adding ice-cold PBS,
and resuspended in 1 mL of lysis buffer (4% (v/v) SDS, 50 mM HEPES
(pH 7.4), 5 mM EDTA, 1× HALT protease inhibitor cocktail (ThermoScientific))
per 0.1 g of fresh weight. The cells were lysed by heating to 95 °C
two times for 5 min, with 10 min of cooling with ice. Proteins were
purified by chloroform–methanol precipitation and resuspended
in 6 M Gua-HCl, 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mM EDTA, and the concentration
was estimated using the BCA assay (ThermoFisher, Dreieich, Germany).
One hundred micrograms of proteome was reduced by the addition of
10 mM DTT for 30 min at 37 °C and alkylated by the addition of
50 mM CAA for 30 min at RT in the dark, and the reaction was quenched
by incubation with 50 mM DTT for 20 min at RT. The proteome was purified
by chloroform–methanol precipitation and resolubilized in the
appropriate digestion buffer.

Proteome Digestions
Proteome aliquots of 100 μg
were individually digested by legumain, GluC, or trypsin. The digestion
with legumain was carried out in a reaction containing 0.1 M MES (pH
6.0), 0.1 M NaCl, and 2 mM DTT at a protease to proteome ratio of
1:50 (m:m), unless otherwise stated. For GluC (SERVA Electrophoresis,
Heidelberg, Germany) digestion, the same amount of proteome was digested
in PBS (pH 7.4) with a protease to proteome ratio of 1:50, whereas
a 1:100 ratio was used for trypsin (SERVA Electrophoresis, Heidelberg,
Germany) digestion in 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.4) supplemented with 5% acetonitrile
and 5 mM CaCl2. The pH was confirmed using pH strips (Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany), and the digestions were carried out at 37 °C
overnight. For pH shift assays with legumain, an aliquot of the MEF
proteome was digested at pH 6.0 for 5 h at 37 °C, and then the
pH was lowered by the stepwise addition of 1 M HCl until pH 4.0 was
reached. An additional 2 μg of legumain and 1 mM DTT were added
and incubated for another 5 h at 37 °C.

Mass Spectrometry
All samples were desalted using self-packed
C18 Stop and Go Extraction tips as previously described.27 Analysis was performed on a two-column nano-HPLC
setup (Ultimate 3000 nano-RSLC system with Acclaim PepMap 100 C18,
i.d. 75 μm, particle size 3 μm; trap column of 2 cm and
analytical column of 50 cm length; ThermoFisher) with a binary gradient
from 5 to 32.5% B for 80 min (A, H2O + 0.1% FA; B, ACN
+ 0.1% FA) and a total runtime of 2 h per sample coupled to a high-resolution
Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Impact II, Bruker) as previously described.28 Data was acquired with the Bruker HyStar Software
(v3.2, Bruker Daltonics) in line-mode in a mass range from 200 to
1500 m/z at an acquisition rate
of 4 Hz. The top 17 most intense ions were selected for fragmentation
with a dynamic exclusion of previously selected precursors for the
next 30 s, unless an intensity increase of factor 3 compared to the
previous precursor spectrum was observed. Intensity-dependent fragmentation
spectra were acquired between 5 Hz, for low-intensity precursor ions
(>500 cts), and 20 Hz, for high-intensity (>25k cts) spectra.
Fragment
spectra were acquired with stepped parameters, each with 50% of the
acquisition time dedicated for each precursor: 61 μs transfer
time, 7 eV collision energy, and a collision radio frequency (RF)
of 1500 Vpp followed by a 100 μs transfer time, 9 eV collision
energy, and a collision RF of 1800 Vpp.

Mass Spectrometry Data
Analysis
Database searches were
performed with MaxQuant29 v.1.6.0.16 using
standard Bruker Q-TOF settings that included peptide mass tolerances
of 0.07 Da in the first search and 0.006 Da in the main search. A. thaliana, M. musculus, and E. coli protein databases were
downloaded from UniProt (A. thaliana release 2018_01, 41350 sequences) with appended common contaminants
as embedded in MaxQuant. The “revert” option was enabled
for decoy database generation. For shotgun proteome samples, specificity
was set to “unspecific” for the characterization of
the cleavage specificity, otherwise according to the enzyme used (cleavage
at K/R|X for trypsin, D/E|X for GluC, or D/N|X for legumain). Oxidation
(M) and acetylation (protein N-term) were set as variable modifications,
and the “match between runs” option was disabled. The
analysis of the label-free shotgun data was performed with Perseus30 v.1.6.1.1; the validation of the protein identification
required at least two unique peptides for each protein and label-free
quantification (LFQ) in at least two replicates. Searches for the
N-termini were performed as described above, except that the enzyme
specificity was set as Arg-C/GluC (DE)/legumain semispecific with
a free N-terminus and duplex dimethyl labeling with light 12CH2O formaldehyde or heavy 13CD2O formaldehyde (peptide N-term and K). Oxidation (M), acetyl (N-term),
Gln → pyro-Glu, and Glu → pyro-Glu were set as dynamic
modifications, and the requantify option was turned off; the unspecific
search window was set to 8–40 amino acids. Data evaluation
and positional annotation for N-termini analyses were performed using
an in-house Perl script (MANTI.pl; available at http://MANTI.sourceforge.io) that combines information provided by MaxQuant and UniProt to annotate
and classify identified N-terminal peptides. In short, MaxQuant peptide
identifications are consolidated by removing nonvalid identifications
(peptides identified with N-terminal pyro-Glu peptides that do not
contain Glu or Gln as N-terminal residue, peptides with dimethylation
at N-terminal Pro), contaminant, reverse database peptides, and nonquantifiable
acetylated peptides in multichannel experiments (no K in peptide sequence
to determine labeled channel). For N-terminal peptides mapping to
multiple entries in the UniProt protein database, a “preferred”
entry was determined in a binary decision tree. Protein entries where
the identified peptide matched positions 1 or 2 were preferred over
alternative positions, and then manually reviewed UniProt protein
entries were favored over alternative models. If multiple entries
persisted, the alphabetically first entry was used to retrieve positional
annotation information. For the visualization of protein sequence
coverage, protein structures were modeled with the Phyre2 server.31

Enrichment of N-Terminal Peptides
Protein N-terminal
peptides were enriched using the high-efficiency undecanal-based N-termini
enrichment (HUNTER) method essentially as previously described.32 Briefly, equal amounts of A.
thaliana proteome were dimethyl labeled with 20 mM
heavy (13CD2O) or light (CH2O) formaldehyde
and 20 mM sodium cyanoborohydride at 37 °C for 16 h to block
all primary amines. To ensure a complete reaction, the same concentration
of reagents was added again and incubated for another 2 h. Proteins
were purified by chloroform–methanol precipitation to remove
excess reagents and dissolved in 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.4), and the protein
concentration was estimated using the BCA assay according to manufacturer
instructions (ThermoFisher, Dreieich, Germany). The samples (400 μg/sample)
were digested with legumain, GluC, and trypsin at 37 °C for 16
h in the respective digestion buffers and protease–proteome
ratios as described above. The protease-generated peptides were hydrophobically
tagged with undecanal using an undecanal–proteome ratio of
50:1 and supplemented with 20 mM sodium cyanoborohydride in 40% ethanol
at 50 °C for 45 min. The reaction was extended by the addition
of 20 mM sodium cyanoborohydride for another 45 min. The reaction
was then acidified with a final 1% TFA and centrifuged at 21000g for 5 min to precipitate free undecanal. Supernatant was
injected to a preactivated HR-X (M) cartridge (Macherey-Nagel, Düren,
Germany). The flow-through containing N-terminal peptides was collected.
Remaining N-terminal peptides on the HR-X (M) cartridge were eluted
with 40% ethanol containing 0.1% TFA, pooled with the first eluate,
and subsequently evaporated in the SpeedVac to a small volume suitable
for C18 StageTips purification.

Identification of Glycosylation
Sites
Apoplastic fluid
proteome enrichment was carried out as described33 with some modifications. The whole A. thaliana rosettes were infiltrated with cold sterile water in a SpeedVac
for 3 min at a pressure between 600 and 2500 Pa. The infiltrated rosettes
were then centrifuged at 4 °C, 3000g for 10
min into a collection tube containing a Halt protease inhibitor cocktail
(ThermoFisher, Dreieich, Germany). Extracted apoplastic fluid proteins
were purified by chloroform–methanol precipitation and resuspended
in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4). The protein concentration was quantified
by using the BCA assay. The sample was then reduced with 5 mM DTT
at 56 °C for 30 min and alkylated with 15 mM iodoacetamide at
25 °C for 30 min in the dark, and the reaction was quenched with
15 mM DTT at 25 °C for 15 min. The protein extract was then separated
into two aliquots. One aliquot of 100 μg of apoplast proteome
was treated with PNGase F (SERVA Electrophoresis, Heidelberg, Germany)
for 2 h at 37 °C before legumain digestion with protease at a
ratio of 1:50 at 37 °C, pH 6 (pH adjusted with final concentration
of 0.1 M MES pH 6.0). In parallel, another 100 μg of protein
extract was predigested with legumain and then treated with PNGase
F using the same conditions. The samples were subsequently dimethyl
labeled with 20 mM heavy (13CD2O) and light
(CH2O) formaldehyde and 20 mM sodium cyanoborohydride at
37 °C for 2 h. The reactions were quenched with 0.1 M Tris pH
7.4 at 37 °C for 1 h and pooled in a 1:1 ratio, and peptides
were purified by C18 StageTips.

Results
Legumain
Cleaves Denatured Proteomes Exclusively after Asn and
Asp
Previous data obtained by in-gel protein digestion-based
specificity profiling22 and by biochemical
characterization with test peptides21 suggested
that legumain cleaves substrates C-terminally to Asn and Asp residues
in a pH-dependent manner, with optimal activity and high selectivity
for Asn-containing substrates near pH 6. To test whether this exquisite
specificity holds true under in-solution proteome digest conditions,
we digested three aliquots of a denatured A. thaliana proteome with legumain at pH 6.0 for 18 h. In parallel, we digested
three aliquots of the same proteome with trypsin and GluC at pH 7.4.
To determine protease cleavage site specificity, peptides were analyzed
by nano-LC–MS/MS and the acquired spectra were matched to the
UniProt A. thaliana proteome database
using nonspecific search settings, i.e., without defining an enzyme
cleavage specificity. This unbiased search identified 4452, 4078,
and 7985 peptide sequences in legumain, GluC, and tryptic digests,
respectively, from which we compiled 6300, 5673, and 12107 unique
nonredundant cleavage sites based on the sequence surrounding both
ends of the identified peptides. For legumain, 93.3% of the observed
cleavage sites were Asn and Asp (51.0% after Asn, 42.3% after Asp).
A small percentage of unspecific cleavage is expected because of endogenous
background proteolysis. The percentage of specific cleavage in a whole
proteome is comparable to 96.7% of cleavages after Lys and Arg, as
observed for trypsin (58.0% after Lys, 38.7% after Arg), and more
stringent than the 85.4% cleavages after Glu and Asp (72.7% after
Glu, 12.7% after Asp), as observed for GluC. The visualization of
the relative amino acid abundance surrounding the cleavage sites with
IceLogos reflected the strict specificity at the P1 position, preceding
the hydrolyzed peptide bond in all three enzymes (Figure 1a−c). While GluC (Figure 1b) and trypsin (Figure 1c) do not allow cleavage
before proline (P1′ position), this is not the case for legumain
(Figure 1a). We further
analyzed a single replicate of a mouse embryonic fibroblast proteome
and identified 1893, 1722, and 4377 peptides using nonspecific database
searches after digestion with legumain, GluC, and trypsin. Similar
specificity profiles were obtained on the basis of the 3244, 2999,
and 7965 nonredundant cleavage sites derived from the peptides in
legumain (Figure 1d),
GluC (Figure 1e), and
trypsin (Figure 1f)
digests, again showing that legumain tolerates Pro at P1′ (Figure 1d). Of the cleavages
observed in legumain digest, 94.5% matched the expected specificity
(63.6% after Asn, 30.9% after Asp), 97.6% in the tryptic digest (51.9%
after Arg, 45.7% after Lys), and 85% in the GluC digest (76.6% after
Glu, 8.4% after Asp). These observations were further confirmed by
analyses of an E. coli proteome (Supporting Information (SI)Figure S1), where 2681 peptides identified after legumain
digestion yielded 4187 cleavage sites with 86.2% cleavage after Asn
and Asp (53.1% after Asn, 33.1% after Asp), while 85.3% of the 8597
unique cleavages observed in 5374 peptides identified after tryptic
digest matched the expected specificity (44.1% after Arg, 41.2% after
Lys).

Complementary Protein Sequence Coverage by
Digestion with Legumain
Compared to GluC and Trypsin
With the strict cleavage specificity
of legumain under proteome digest conditions confirmed by the unbiased
database search, we repeated spectra-to-sequence matching using standard
enzyme-specific settings with up to three missed cleavages, using
cleavage after Asn and Asp as a specificity rule for legumain. As
expected, the smaller search space significantly increased the number
of peptide identifications in the A. thaliana data set by 64%, 8%, and 66% to 7284, 4394, and 12806 unique peptide
sequences for legumain, GluC, and trypsin, respectively (Figure 2a). Specific searches
of the MEF proteome data set increased peptide identifications by
129%, 73%, and 61% to 4296, 2983, and 8489 unique peptides for legumain,
GluC, and trypsin, respectively, compared to results for nonspecific
searches. In E. coli, peptide identifications
improved by 33% and 7% to 3568 and 5767 unique peptides for legumain
and trypsin.

quantification (MaxQuant LFQ). Only proteins quantified with two or

While trypsin showed the expected superior performance, legumain
digests resulted in the identification of more peptides than GluC,
for example, 66% more in the A. thaliana data set. Interestingly, the legumain and GluC data sets showed
only a minimal overlap of 66 identical peptides delimited by cleavages
after Asp on both sides, which may occur with both enzymes but are
not favored by GluC under the applied reaction conditions (Figure 2a). The analysis
of the mass (Figure 2b), hydrophobicity (Figure 2c), and isoelectric point (Figure 2d) of the identified A. thaliana peptides revealed very similar properties for all three enzymes.
In contrast, the biophysical properties of all theoretical peptides
in in silico-digested A. thaliana and M. musculus proteomes predicted
a higher number of peptides with pI > 9 in GluC- and legumain-digested
proteomes compared to those with trypsin (SI Figure S2a,b). However, a comparison to our data (Figure 2b–d) suggests that such
peptides are rarely identified with the standard experimental setup
with reverse-phase chromatography under acidic conditions and ionization
and mass spectrometric analysis in positive ion mode. Despite these
physical similarities, peptides identified after digestion with the
three proteases covered distinct amino acids in the identified A. thaliana proteins (Figure 2e).

In total, the parallel application
of legumain, GluC, and trypsin
in technical triplicates identified 1524, 1090, and 2380 protein groups
in the A. thaliana proteome, respectively,
combining to a total of 2785 protein groups, with legumain contributing
8.8% exclusive identifications (Figure 2g,h, SI Table S1). As expected
from the number of peptide identifications, a large majority of 2057
proteins (74.3%) had the highest sequence coverage in the tryptic
digest, followed by 507 (18.3%) in legumain digests and 206 (7.4%)
in GluC digests (SI Table S1). For example,
the sequence coverage of superoxide dismutase (At1g08830) (Figure 2f, SI Figure S3a) was a remarkable 93% in legumain digests compared
to 43% and 49% in the GluC and trypsin data sets, and sequence coverage
of the germin-like protein 1 (At1g72610) was at 63% with legumain
compared to only 23% and 8% with GluC and trypsin (SI Figure S3b). Notably, for each of the three proteases >80%
of the proteins were identified in all three replicates, indicating
a high degree of reproducibility in the digests (SI Figure S4a). On the single replicate level, the combination
of any tryptic digest with any legumain or GluC digest resulted in
a slightly higher number of protein identifications than any two tryptic
replicates combined (SI Figure S4b). We
further compared reproducibility by label free proteome quantification
(LFQ) with MaxQuant after filtering for protein groups quantified
by two or more peptides (SI Table S2).
This demonstrated excellent correlation of the LFQ values between
the technical digestion replicates and also a high correlation between
the LFQ values obtained from digests of the three different proteases
(Figure 2i).

In the MEF proteome, 1469, 1140, and 2242 protein groups were identified
in legumain, GluC, and tryptic digests, combining to 2587 protein
groups in total, with 7.7% exclusively identified in the legumain
digests (SI Figure S4c). A larger overlap
was observed between the E. coli proteome
digests, where 842 and 1180 protein groups were identified after legumain
and tryptic digestion, respectively, but only 37 (3%) of these were
exclusive for legumain (SI Figure S4d).

Legumain Cleaves after Asn More Efficiently than after Asp
The digestion efficiency of a protease can be reflected by the
number of missed potential cleavage sites within the identified peptides.
In the A. thaliana data set, legumain
generated on average 53% of the peptides without missed cleavage sites,
34% with one missed potential cleavage site, and 13% with more than
one missed cleavage site (Figure 3a). GluC performed worse, with only 30% of the peptides
with no missed cleavage, but almost 12% of the identified peptides
containing three missed cleavage sites. Trypsin was the best performing
enzyme, with only 18% of the peptides containing one or more missed
cleavage sites (Figure 3a). When we further considered the identity of the amino acid residue,
we noted that legumain reliably cleaved after Asn residues, with only
5% of the peptides containing an internal Asn, but it missed one or
more Asp in 40% of the peptides (Figure 3b). Most missed cleavage sites in GluC-digested
proteomes were at Asp, and even trypsin showed a higher fidelity at
Arg than at Lys (Figure 3b). Remarkably, legumain cleaved after Asn residues as efficiently
as trypsin at the favored Arg-containing cleavage sites. Similar trends
were observed in digests of MEF and E. coli proteomes, where legumain digests consistently showed a high cleavage
efficiency at Asn sites with more missed cleavages at Asp (SI Figure S5).

Assessing Legumain Efficiency in Different
Reaction Conditions
Previous publications have shown that
legumain is more active at
a lower pH24 and that cleavage after Asn
is favored at a higher pH.22 To test if
this is also the case with the digest conditions applied here, we
digested whole-leaf A. thaliana proteome
at varying pHs between 5.0 and 6.5 for shorter (2 h) and longer (24
h) incubation times (SI Figure S6a). We
observed the highest number of peptide identifications at pH 5.5 and
pH 6, which may have been caused by the higher propensity for proteome
precipitation at a lower pH that we observed in concentrated samples.
As expected, legumain showed an increasing preference for Asn with
an increasing pH, and this kinetic preference was also reflected at
different digestion times. Short proteome digestions (2 h) and/or
lower pH (pH 5.0) resulted in a higher proportion of Asn cleavages
(SI Figure S6b), whereas longer incubation
(24 h) and/or higher pH yielded more complete cleavage after Asp (SI Figure S6b). On the basis of this observation,
we tested whether acidification of the MEF proteome digest after an
initial incubation at pH 6 would result in more complete cleavage
at Asp residues. Indeed, this two-step incubation maintained efficient
cleavage at Asn residues while decreasing the number of peptides containing
missed Asp cleavage sites (SI Figure S5).

Denaturants are commonly used for proteome preparations
but are problematic during digestion. We tested the tolerance of legumain
to urea and guanidinium hydrochloride but observed dramatically decreased
digestion efficiency (SI Figure S7a), reflected
in decreased peptide identifications (SI Figure S7b) with an increased frequency of missed cleavage (SI Figure S7c). In contrast, legumain tolerated
the organic solvent acetonitrile quite well with little decrease in
efficiency up to 10% acetonitrile concentration (SI Figure S7).

We also assessed the amount of legumain
necessary to achieve optimal
digest by varying the protease to proteome ratio. Digestion appeared
equally efficient in several dilutions down to a legumain to proteome
ratio of 1:100, as judged by the number of identified peptides from
an equal starting material (SI Figure S8a). Another important enzyme property for routine use is the shelf-life
time, where our recombinant legumain preparations withstood 10 freeze/thaw
cycles without loss of peptidase activity (SI Figure S8b).

Legumain is Highly Complementary for Protein
N-Termini Profiling
The complementarity of different digestion
enzymes is particularly
helpful for the identification of specific post-translational modification
sites such as phosphorylations14,16 and protein termini,10,20 as these may reside in sequences that are not accessible by trypsin.
To demonstrate the value of legumain for this purpose, we profiled
N-termini in the A. thaliana leaf proteome
with our recently established HUNTER protocol (Figure 4a).36 In three
replicates per enzyme, two aliquots of A. thaliana leaf proteome were differentially dimethyl labeled to block all
unmodified primary amines. Thus, all protein N-termini are modified,
either by endogenous modifications such as acetylation or by in vitro dimethylation. Differentially labeled duplicates
are unified and digested in parallel with legumain, GluC, or trypsin.
This digestion generates new N-terminal primary amines in all internal
and C-terminal peptides, which are then undecanal labeled while the
blocked N-terminal peptides remain inert. Undecanal tagging increases
the hydrophobicity of the digest-generated peptides, which enables
their selective retention on a C18 cartridge, while the dimethyl labeled
(or otherwise modified) protein N-terminal peptides are highly enriched
in the flow-through for selective analysis (Figure 4a). With this negative selection, we identified
a total of 4773 N-terminal peptides (SI Table S3), with 1167, 1209, and 2342 N-terminal peptides identified
in legumain, GluC, and tryptic digests, respectively. The differential
labeling demonstrated equivalent accuracy in quantification for all
three enzymes (SI Figure S9). For comparison
of the overlap of identified protein N-termini, we extracted the first
seven residues of each N-terminal peptide (Figure 4b). Only a minority of 100 protein N-termini
were identified by all three proteases, and an additional 632 were
identified by two proteases, with a majority of 2101 N-termini identified
only in digests of a single enzyme (Figure 4b). For example, the acetylated, native N-terminus
of the glucosinolate transporter-1 NPF2.10 was only identified in
legumain digests, whereas multiple Glu in the N-terminal peptide excluded
identification in GluC digests, while the tryptic digest would deliver
a very long peptide with unfavorably high content in acidic amino
acids (Figure 4c).
Similarly, legumain digests uniquely identified an endoproteolytic
processing site in CLPR3 (Figure 4d).

Legumain as a Tool for
N-Glycosylation Site Mapping
N-Glycosylation is an important
and frequent modification of secreted
proteins.23,37 The removal of the glycan by PNGase F results
in deamidation of the Asn to Asp and facilitates mass spectrometry-based
identification of occupied N-glycosylation sites.38 We speculated that N-glycosylation would prevent legumain
from hydrolyzing adjacent peptide bonds, on the basis of the crystal
structure of human legumain that revealed that the zwitterionic character
of its S1 subsite provides an ideal binding site for Asn, but no space
to accommodate a glycosylated Asn residue.39 In contrast, Asp residues resulting from deglycosylation by a PNGase
F treatment would be cleaved. Thus, a sequential treatment with legumain
and PNGase F should result in longer peptides containing a missed
deamidated Asn (Figure 5a, workflow 1), whereas a PNGase F treatment before legumain digest
should result in shorter peptides ending with a deamidated Asn (Figure 5a, workflow 2). In
proof of concept, we isolated A. thaliana apoplastic fluid proteome enriched in secreted N-glycosylated proteins
and sequentially treated two aliquots with legumain and PNGase F and
vice versa in two parallel reactions (Figure 5a). Treated peptides were differentially
dimethyl labeled with heavy and light formaldehyde and combined before
nano-LC–MS/MS analysis. Indeed, we found several peptides that
fulfilled the expectations (Figure 5b, SI Table S4). Peptides
from 45 proteins contained a deamidated Asn as missed cleavage in
workflow 1, whereas peptides from 49 proteins ended with deamidated
Asn. For 6 proteins, including myrosinase 1 (TGG1), an important glycoprotein
involved in plant defense,40 we observed
peptides matching to the same N-glycosylation sites in both workflows,
providing intrinsic orthogonal validation (Figure 5c). Notably, this glycosylation site has
also been reported previously.41

Discussion
It is well established that the use of complementary
proteases
with different specificity in bottom-up proteomic workflows can improve
proteome coverage and provide access to sequences that are missed
in tryptic digests.3,11 This not only allows identification
of “missing proteins” that have not been identified
by mass spectrometry before,42 one of the
central goals of the Human Proteome Project,43 but also is important for comprehensive mapping of post-translational
modification sites including phosphorylations14,16 and global identification of protein termini.10,20 Here we characterize human legumain as a new digestion protease
in the proteomic toolbox. Legumain exhibited strict sequence specificity
for cleavage after Asn and Asp and a high cleavage efficiency that
makes it a highly suitable alternative proteolytic enzyme for proteomics.

We have established conditions for reliable in-solution proteome
digestion with legumain and show that the alternative cleavage site
at Asn yields an entirely different set of peptides than trypsin does,
with only minimal overlap in the number of identified peptides delimited
by Asp on both sides, in comparison to those with GluC digests. In
agreement with the kinetic cleavage preferences determined with peptide
substrates,22,24 Vidmar et al. reported only minimal
cleavage at Asp residues at pH 6 during in-gel digestion of a denatured
proteome.22 In contrast, we have observed
a much higher cleavage efficiency at Asp residues at pH 6 in our data
set, which likely arises from the different digest conditions (in-gel
digestion for 2 h with citrate buffer22 compared to in-solution digestion for 16 h in a MES buffer). We
noted that the data set of Vidmar et al.22 contains a higher proportion of missed cleavages at Asn and Asp
residues than our data set (SI Figure S10), suggesting that the prolonged reaction under more favorable in-solution
conditions enables legumain to have a more complete cleavage at Asp
residues even at pH 6.0. Notably, a similar effect was observed for
Ulilysin/LysargiNase, which has a strong preference for Arg when tested
with peptide substrates44 but results in
a near-complete digestion at Lys residues under proteome digest conditions.12

Digestion with legumain consistently identified
more peptides than
digestion with GluC, but trypsin was far superior. This has been reported
for various other digestion proteases, particularly those that do
not select for cleavage at basic residues.4,11 One
explanation is that digestion with enzymes such as legumain and GluC
generates peptides with internal basic residues. This can give rise
to internal fragment ions during collision-induced dissociation (CID)
and result in unassignable, complex spectra.4 In contrast, fragmentation by electron transfer dissociation (ETD)
is not affected by the position of the basic residues and has been
reported to improve peptide identifications after digestion with proteases
that generate long peptides or peptides with internal basic residues.4

Parallel digests with all three enzymes
increased proteome and
protein sequence coverage and were particularly beneficial for protein
N-termini identification, where a single digest often generated N-terminal
peptides that are too short, too long, or otherwise unfavorable for
identification.9 By extension, similar
benefits may be expected for other post-translational modifications.
Furthermore, using a sequential incubation with legumain and PNGase
F, we have demonstrated that legumain cannot cleave after glycosylated
Asn residues, in contrast to deamidated deglycosylated Asn after PNGase
F treatment. On a larger scale, evidence for N-glycosylation can be
obtained by PNGase F treatment in 18O-water, which results
in deamidation of Asn to partially 18O-labeled Asp.38 However, this partial labeling makes relative
quantification across samples challenging, while omission of the 18O-labeling decreases confidence of the site identification
as deamidation can also occur spontaneously. On the basis of our proof-of-concept
experiment with A. thaliana apoplast
proteome, we propose tandem sequential PNGase F/legumain treatment
as an alternative strategy for experimental validation of N-glycosylation
sites.

There are many further potential applications for legumain
in peptide-centric
proteome workflows. We have previously used legumain to generate high-quality E. coli proteome-derived peptide libraries, which
enabled detailed cleavage specificity profiling of the vitamin K-dependent
coagulation protease sirtilin that would not be possible in trypsin-generated
libraries.45 Legumain maintains activity
at a low pH, down to pH 4.0, and is active in nonreducing conditions;21 therefore it is also suitable for protein disulfide
bond determination at the low-pH environment required to prevent disulfide
reshuffling.46 Currently pepsin is used
for these experiments due to its high activity under acidic conditions.
However, pepsin generates a large number of overlapping peptides due
to its broad specificity with a nonexclusive preference for cleavage
after Tyr, Phe, Trp, and Leu that complicate the spectra assignment,
whereas legumain’s high cleavage specificity would alleviate
this problem. Taken together, we propose that recombinant human legumain
is an attractive protease to complement trypsin in bottom-up mass
spectrometry-based proteomics.
