With
the potential for each droplet to act as a unique reaction
vessel, droplet microfluidics is a powerful tool for high-throughput
discovery. Any attempt at compound screening miniaturization must
address the significant scaling inefficiencies associated with library
handling and distribution. Eschewing microplate-based compound collections
for one-bead-one-compound (OBOC) combinatorial libraries, we have
developed hνSABR (Light-Induced
and -Graduated High-Throughput Screening After Bead Release), a microfluidic
architecture that integrates a suspension hopper for compound library
bead introduction, droplet generation, microfabricated waveguides
to deliver UV light to the droplet flow for photochemical compound
dosing, incubation, and laser-induced fluorescence for assay readout.
Avobenzone-doped PDMS (0.6% w/w) patterning confines UV exposure to
the desired illumination region, generating intradroplet compound
concentrations (>10 μM) that are reproducible between devices.
Beads displaying photochemically cleavable pepstatin A were distributed
into droplets and exposed with five different UV intensities to demonstrate
dose–response screening in an HIV-1 protease activity assay.
This microfluidic architecture introduces a new analytical approach
for OBOC library screening, and represents a key component of a next-generation
distributed small molecule discovery platform.

==== Body
High-throughput
small molecule
discovery, currently the exclusive province of large industrial and
academic high-throughput screening (HTS) facilities, has long been
in the sights of microfluidic technology developers. Miniaturizing
the many thousands (or millions) of assay reactions and replacing
robotic automation with integrated microfluidic handling was to deliver
this powerful, unbiased mode of discovery from the cost and infrastructure
burdens of big, centralized science. While miniaturization via microfabrication
and microfluidics has proven capable of reducing reaction volumes
by orders of magnitude,1−4 distributing the massive molecular diversity of an HTS compound
library one member at a time into these minute assay volumes has presented
a significant engineering challenge.

“Sipping,”
or serially sampling compounds from microplate-based
libraries is the most common approach to interface a compound library
in the macro world with microfluidic circuitry.5,6 However,
applying a sipping-based library distribution paradigm to interface
large (>105) compound collections with microfluidic
droplets
is not trivial because it requires: access to a microplate-based library,
a robotic sipping mechanism, library reformatting from DMSO stocks,
an encoding strategy to preserve compound identity in a droplet population,5 and compound mixing with assay and target.7,8

Alternatively, it is possible to conceive of a screening paradigm
that eliminates entirely the need for microfluidic technology to interface
with microplate-based HTS, thereby escaping the scaling challenges.
Integrating one-bead-one-compound (OBOC) libraries with droplet-scale
assays poses such an alternative. Combinatorial OBOC library synthesis
is an inexpensive and highly efficient route to large compound collections,9−11 and depositing single library beads into discrete microscale volumes
has proven a feasible approach to measure a compound’s biological
activity.12−15 Adapting this concept to the droplet scale promised significant
gains in handling and throughput, but faced a vexing obstacle in the
introduction of rapidly settling OBOC beads into the microfluidic
architecture. We previously disclosed the suspension hopper, a key
microfluidic circuit component that enables introduction and distribution
of hundreds of thousands of synthesis resin beads into picoliter-scale
droplets.16 Applying these findings to
large OBOC libraries, however, would require reproducible and predictive
compound liberation from library beads under high-throughput flow
conditions to initiate screening. Here, we present devices fabricated
using two-tone soft lithographic patterning with avobenzone-doped
PDMS that feature a well-defined droplet illumination region and enable
miniaturized droplet-scale, dose-dependent functional screens of OBOC
libraries. We call this approach hνSABR, or Light-Induced and -Graduated High-Throughput Screening After
Bead Release (LIGHTSABR).

Solvents used in solid-phase synthesis were dried over molecular sieves
(3 Å, 3.2 mm pellets). All solid-phase synthesis was conducted
in a UV-free environment, and all reactions were performed in DMF
with rotation (22 rpm) unless otherwise noted. Thrombin cleavage buffer
(20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 0.5% w/v BSA,
pH 8.4) and HIV-1 protease activity assay buffer (100 mM 4-morpholineethanesulfonic
acid, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2% v/v DMSO, 0.5% w/v BSA, 0.1% Tween-80,
pH 6.5) were prepared in DI water and filtered (0.22-μm Steritop,
EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) before use.

Microfluidic Device Fabrication
and Operation
Channel
structures were fabricated in PDMS using soft lithography.17 Two-tone patterned PDMS devices were fabricated
in a two-step process. Avobenzone (34 mg) was dissolved in toluene
(200 μL) and mixed into of PDMS prepolymer (5.5 g, 10:1 elastomer
base/curing agent). Degassed avobenzone-PDMS prepolymer was loaded
into a disposable syringe (3 mL, BD Medical, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and
applied over the incubation channel and bead-introduction reservoir
regions of the master. After partial curing (80 °C, 12 min),
native, degassed PDMS prepolymer (44 g, 10:1) was poured on top of
the master and cured to completion (80 °C, 1 h). Fluidic access
ports were punched with a biopsy punch (0.75 mm, World Precision Instruments,
Inc., Sarasota, FL). Wells for droplet collection were prepared by
excising a region (4 mm dia.) from a featureless piece of PDMS (3
mm thick). Patterned PDMS devices and glass microscope backing slides
were immersed in an acid hydrolysis solution (5:1:1 DI water/HCl/H2O2, 30 min), rinsed, dried, and immediately bonded
together (80 °C, overnight).18 Collection
wells were similarly bonded. Channel depths (50 and 150 μm)
were measured using a stylus profilometer (DektakXT, Bruker, Billerica,
MA). Microbore Tygon tubing (0.01” i.d. × 0.03”
o.d., Saint Gobain, Valley Forge, PA) and PTFE tubing (0.018”
i.d. × 0.03” o.d., Zeus Industrial Products, Orangeburg,
SC) were used to connect the inlet ports on the device to glass syringes
(250 and 500 μL, Hamilton, Reno, NV) via blunt-tip Luer-Lok
needles (30-gauge, Small Parts, Inc., Miramar, FL). Fluids were driven
through the circuit with syringe pumps (Legato 100, KD Scientific,
Holliston, MA).

Microsolidic mirrors were fabricated by first
priming the mirror channel (3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane). Low-melting
temperature solder (51:32.5:16.5 indium/bismuth/tin, Indium Corporation
of America, Utica, NY) was melted and pulled through the channel with
vacuum while the device was seated on a hot plate (115 °C). The
device was then cooled to RT, solidifying the solder.19

Integrated Waveguide Fabrication
One end of a custom
optical fiber patch cable (600-μm dia., 0.39 NA, Thorlabs) was
coupled to a high-power UV LED (365 nm, Thorlabs), and the other end
was inserted into a microfluidic waveguide channel (150 μm deep,
expanded further by a biopsy punch) and secured. The channel was filled
with optical adhesive (NOA 71, Norland Products, Cranbury, NJ), and
cured (3.5 J/cm2, longwave UV light).20 As a final curing step, UV light from the LED (current
= 300 mA) was transmitted through the patch cable and into the waveguide
for 30 min prior to calibration.

Integrated Circuit Operation
Prior to droplet generation,
the incubation channel was backfilled with oil phase (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The oil phase
consisted of (20:76:4 w/w/w) silicone oil (DMF-A-6CS, Shin-Etsu, Akron,
OH), mineral oil, and surfactant (KF-6038, Shin-Etsu). Aqueous droplets
(200–250 pL) in oil were generated at a flow focusing channel
intersection.21 Oil (0.9 μL/min)
was driven into the circuit through the OIL inlet and aqueous phase
(0.5 μL/min total) was driven into the circuit through the AQ1
and AQ2 inlets. For all experiments involving photochemical compound
dosing, the outside surface of the suspension hopper was treated with
an alcohol-based commercial sunscreen (Banana Boat Clear UltraMist).

Microfluidic Droplet Incubation Analysis
Droplets were
generated using one aqueous phase (AQ1) consisting of fluorescein
(300 nM) and phycoerythrin (20 μg/mL) in thrombin cleavage buffer
and a second aqueous phase (AQ2) consisting of phycoerythrin alone
(20 μg/mL). Flow rates were alternated between 0.4 and 0.1 μL/min
(AQ1/AQ2) and 0.1 and 0.4 μL/min AQ1/AQ2. A threshold was set
in the 520 nm channel to count high-fluorescein droplets (0.4 μL/min
AQ1) and a threshold was set in the 570 nm channel to count all droplets.
As the two AQ flow rates were switched, data collection was initiated
for 35 min (500 Hz). Data were analyzed using a custom LabVIEW program
to tally droplet counts and IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR)
to calculate mean incubation time and transition time.

Waveguide Calibration
for Photochemical Compound Dosing
Brilliant Violet 570 streptavidin
(BV570, 1 μg/mL in thrombin
cleavage buffer) was pumped through the calibration channel (0.5 μL/min).
The dye was excited using the integrated waveguide (LED current =
0, 100, 200, 400 mA), and emission was measured in the 570 nm channel
(500 Hz). The calibration channel was rinsed with water, dried, and
filled with trimethylsiloxy-terminated PDMS. Beads displaying a fluorescein-labeled
compound attached to resin with an o-nitrobenzyl
photolabile linker (PC-FAM beads) were distributed into droplets (20
μg/mL phycoerythrin in thrombin cleavage buffer, AQ1) via a
suspension hopper16 and directed through
the UV illumination region for photochemical cleavage. Photochemically
cleaved compound fluorescence was detected at turn 4 in the incubation
channel (1 kHz). The LED was held at 0 mA (5 or 10 min), then LED
current was changed from 0 to 100, 200, 400, and then back to 0 mA
in 15 min intervals. The droplet stream was dispensed into PDMS wells
prefilled with oil (∼50 μL) and the collected droplets
imaged using an inverted epifluorescence microscope (10X, 0.25 NA,
Axio Observer A1, Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) equipped with a CCD camera
(AxioCam ICm1, Zeiss) to determine droplet volume (ImageJ, NIH, Bethesda,
MD).22 Droplet concentration was calibrated
by adding a stream of 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (50 μM) to AQ2
and changing the flow rate ratio of AQ1 and AQ2 to produce droplets
containing various concentrations of fluorescein (0, 25, and 50 μM).
Data were analyzed using a custom LabVIEW program that calculates
the statistical mode for each droplet’s fluorescence profile
and IGOR Pro to generate histograms of droplet fluorescence. Mean
fluorescence and standard deviation were determined by fitting the
histogram peaks to a Gaussian curve. Fluorescence intensity values
were used to calculate [FAM] using the calibration curve.

Integrated
Droplet-Based HIV-1 Protease Activity Assay
HIV-1 protease
was generated immediately prior to each experiment
by in vitro transcription/translation (IVTT) as described previously.16 HIV-1 protease IVTT product diluted 5-fold in
HIV-1 protease activity assay buffer (AQ2, 0.2 μL/min) and fluorogenic
peptide probe (1X) in assay buffer (AQ1, 0.3 μL/min) combine
immediately prior to a flow focusing junction to form droplets of
HIV-1 protease activity assay. Beads displaying pepstatin A attached
to resin with an o-nitrobenzyl photolabile linker
(PC-pepstatin A beads, ∼500 beads/μL) were distributed
into droplets via a suspension hopper, directed to the illumination
region for UV irradiation, then driven through the entire incubation
channel. Droplet assay data were acquired via confocal laser-induced
fluorescence detection (1 kHz). A second oil stream (OIL2, 0.45 μL/min)
was used to space droplets apart immediately prior to detection. HIV-1
protease activity in the presence of inhibitor was determined by switching
the IVTT reaction stream to assay buffer such that droplets contained
only fluorogenic probe. Data were analyzed using a custom LabVIEW
program that calculates the statistical mode for each droplet’s
fluorescence profile and IGOR Pro to generate histograms of droplet
fluorescence. Mean fluorescence and standard deviation were determined
by fitting the histogram peaks to a Gaussian curve and used to calculate
Z-factor23 between populations of empty
and 1-bead droplets.

Results and Discussion
Delivery and Containment
of UV Light in a PDMS Circuit
Three circuit components (waveguide,
serpentine, and mirror) collectively
define the “illumination region,” which lies directly
downstream of the droplet generation junction and upstream of the
incubation channel (Figure 1). Photochemical cleavage of library compound from the bead
into the droplet requires precise droplet irradiation with UV light,
which enters the integrated circuit via a microfabricated waveguide
consisting of an optical adhesive core (NOA 71, n = 1.56)20 with borosilicate glass and
PDMS cladding (n = 1.47 and 1.41, respectively).
The illuminating face of the waveguide (150 μm high × 1
mm wide) sits adjacent a 9-pass serpentine channel and opposite a
metal microsolidic mirror.24 The eight
additional passes in the serpentine increase UV exposure ∼480%
and the mirror reflects unabsorbed light from the waveguide back into
the serpentine, further increasing UV exposure ∼50% for a single-pass
channel (Figure S2).

Figure 1 Circuit schematic. Oil,
aqueous phase components, and compound
library beads enter at input ports OIL1, AQ1 & AQ2, and LIB, respectively.
A flow-focusing junction generates droplets that encapsulate the library
beads and immediately flow through a serpentine channel bounded by
an integrated optical waveguide and a microsolidic mirror (“illumination
region”, white box in the micrograph inset). UV irradiation
photochemically cleaves compound from the library beads, establishing
a UV dose-dependent compound concentration within the droplet. Compound-dosed
droplets then feed into a 20 cm-long incubation channel toward the
OUT output port. Color-coded features designate microbore Tygon tubing
connectors (magenta), 50-μm channel depth (black), 150-μm
channel depth (blue), and the LIF detection point (green). Micrographs
(inset) illustrate suspension hopper input (LIB) for library bead
introduction, UV illumination region, and incubation channel constrictions
and turns (top to bottom). Scale =200 μm.

It is critical to confine library bead exposure with UV light
strictly
to the illumination region. If stray radiation induces compound cleavage
prior to encapsulation, then droplets will contain a mixture of compounds
from hundreds—if not thousands—of library beads. Furthermore,
if encapsulated beads experience continued exposure during incubation,
the compound concentration during assay would be variable. Incorporating
avobenzone, a common UV-absorbent ingredient in sunscreens, into the
PDMS seemed a straightforward method to intercept stray 365 nm light
outside the illumination region. However, if avobenzone were present
within the illumination region, it would counterproductively attenuate
UV intensity at the point of photochemical compound cleavage. Furthermore,
we observed avobenzone readily leaching from doped PDMS into the continuous
phase, necessitating a strategy to minimize contact with droplet flow
upstream of the illumination region.

We devised a two-step mold
fabrication protocol for selectively
patterning avobenzone-doped PDMS only in regions that required UV
screening, which includes bead introduction (LIB, Figure 1), incubation (blue circuit
segments, Figure 1),
and detection regions (green, Figure 1). Selective patterning of these regions on the SU-8
master with avobenzone-doped PDMS prepolymer (Figure 2A,B), partial curing, and further encasing
within native PDMS following the partial cure produced a two-tone
PDMS mold. Doped prepolymer (20 mM avobenzone, ∼ 0.6% w/w)
exhibited necessary and sufficient absorbance at λ < 400
nm (Figure 2C) in photochemical
dosing experiments that compared the dosing behavior of droplets containing
PC-FAM beads (Figure S3) in circuits with
and without avobenzone-doped PDMS patterning. The device with avobenzone-doped
PDMS features sharp, stepwise transitions in photochemical dosing,
correlating with programmed stepwise changes in LED intensity. The
device without avobenzone-dosed PDMS yielded a fluorescence profile
that lacked well-defined correlation with LED intensity, instead producing
gradual transitions suggestive of continuous UV exposure (Figure S4).

PDMS. (A) Patterning
involves two sequential applications of PDMS on the SU-8/silicon master.
Avobenzone-doped PDMS prepolymer (gold) is applied to the desired
regions and partially cured prior to addition of native PDMS prepolymer.
The PDMS mold is fully cured, peeled from the master, and bonded to
a glass microscope slide. (B) A micrograph demonstrates patterning
of the device using fluorescein-doped PDMS (green) for visualization.
The circuit (white overlay) illustrates registration of avobenzone-doped
PDMS with the incubation channel to prevent stray radiation from continuously
dosing compound downstream of the UV illumination region. (C) UV–vis
absorbance spectra of both native PDMS (black trace) and doped PDMS
(20 mM avobenzone, gold trace, structure inset) confirmed attenuation
of 365 nm illumination using avobenzone.

A previous strategy to prevent UV scattering in PDMS devices
involved
synthesizing fluorescent dapoxyl-labeled silica nanoparticles and
incorporating them into the PDMS prepolymer.25 However, the dapoxyl dye is expensive (∼$27/mg) and the fluorescence
generated by the dye-labeled nanoparticles will interfere with LIF
detection. Previous work that did not require synthesis described
mixing a dye solution into the PDMS prepolymer to produce devices
with integrated long-pass optical filters,26 analogous to our need for UV-filtering PDMS. We chose avobenzone
as our dopant because it effectively and selectively absorbs long-wave
UV light, does not fluoresce, and is cheap (<$0.02/mg).

Waveguide
Calibration
UV exposure in the illumination
region is heavily dependent on the quality of the patch cable/NOA
waveguide coupling, which can vary significantly between devices for
the same LED intensity and requires calibration. Waveguide calibration
entails exciting a solution of BV570 fluorescent dye (λex and λem = 405/570 nm, respectively) flowing
through a calibration channel (Figure 3A) with the LED via the waveguide and measuring emission
at 570 nm. After recording steady-state BV570 fluorescence for each
desired LED intensity, the calibration channel is filled with PDMS
to make the channel optically transparent for “screening mode”
operation (Figure 3B). Encapsulated PC-FAM beads are exposed with UV light at the same
LED intensities used during calibration in order to demonstrate controlled
photochemical cleavage and concomitant increase in droplet fluorescence
measured in the incubation channel. Dosing response varied as much
as 110% for the same LED intensity over a set of five different experiments
(Figure 3C), and normalization
for droplet volume only marginally reduced the noise. Thus, patch
cable/waveguide coupling variability during device fabrication is
likely the source of experimental noise. Nonetheless, plotting normalized
intradroplet [FAM] as a function of BV570 fluorescence intensity (Figure 3D) yielded a linear
relationship (r2 = 0.99), allowing direct
comparison of experiments performed on different devices and predictive
photochemical compound dosing in droplets. Using the calibration curve,
we calculated BV570 emission intensities predicted to yield 1, 3,
and 10 μM fluorescein-labeled photochemical cleavage product,
and identified LED intensities to produce those values. Subsequent
photochemical droplet dosing experimental data agreed well with predicted
values (Figure 3E).

Figure 3 Integrated
waveguide calibration. (A) The calibration channel (magenta)
is filled with calibrant dye (BV570) and excited with UV light from
the integrated waveguide (purple). BV570 fluorescence emission (micrograph
inset) is measured at different UV intensities (LED current =100,
200, 400 mA). (B) After waveguide calibration, the calibration channel
is filled with PDMS (blue hatch) and droplets containing PC-FAM beads
are irradiated in the serpentine channel between the waveguide and
the mirror (gray). UV illumination of the dye-filled dosing channel
reveals the light transmission from the waveguide through the serpentine
(micrograph inset). (C) The concentration of fluorescein-labeled photochemical
cleavage product exhibited significant variance (n = 5 devices and days), either as absolute concentrations (black
circles) or normalized droplet concentrations (blue circles, volume
normalized to 200 pL). Error bars for each measurement have been removed
for clarity. (D) Normalized concentration data were plotted as a function
of BV570 fluorescence intensity during calibration. (E) The observed
intradroplet [FAM] correlated well with predicted concentrations for
[FAM] = 1, 3, and 10 μM based on calibration data. The dashed
line slope =1.

While attempting waveguide
calibration by flowing BV570 through
the serpentine, we discovered that a dedicated calibration channel
is necessary because prolonged exposure to 365 nm light in an aqueous
environment significantly disrupts subsequent droplet formation. This
effect is most likely due to PDMS surface oxidation with polar silanol
groups as long-wave UV exposure depletes surface —CH3 groups and replaces them with silanol groups, albeit with slow kinetics.27 The presence of aqueous media during calibration
likely increased the kinetics, as subsequent droplet generation was
not disrupted when an empty channel was similarly exposed to UV light.

Droplet Incubation
After UV exposure establishes a
desired intradroplet compound concentration, droplets are driven through
the incubation channel prior to detection. The incubation channel
(20 cm long, 1 mm wide, 150 μm deep) contains constriction points
that randomize droplet position horizontally in the channel to minimize
parabolic flow-induced dispersion.28 Furthermore,
droplets separate into two vertical layers while flowing through the
150-μm-deep channel segments. Tapered turns are 50 μm
deep and act as constriction points that randomize droplets between
the two layers. Droplet incubation times were determined by exchanging
the flow rates of AQ1 (fluorescein) and AQ2 (buffer) and detecting
the transition between populations of droplets with “high”
and “low” fluorescence, which fits to a Gaussian cumulative
distribution function (Figure 4). The mean incubation time (50% high-fluorescence droplets)
is 25.5 ± 0.6 min for 4 identical runs. Another important parameter
for incubation is the dispersion ratio (quotient of transition time
and incubation time).28 We define the transition
as 6σ. The average dispersion ratio for our circuit is 13.4
± 1.5%, which does not impair droplet assay progression or readout.

Figure 4 Online
droplet incubation. Droplet incubation time in the integrated
circuit was determined by exchanging the flow rates of AQ1 (fluorescein,
0.4 μL/min) and AQ2 (buffer, 0.1 μL/min) and keeping the
total flow rate constant (0.5 μL/min). AQ1/AQ2 exchange generates
a transition from high-fluorescence droplets to low-fluorescence droplets,
or vice versa. Incubation times for droplets in the 20 cm-long incubation
channel with AQ and OIL flow rates of 0.5 and 0.9 μL/min, respectively,
are 25.5 ± 0.6 min (n = 4).

Droplet-Based HIV-1 Protease Activity Assay
The integrated
circuit was used to perform an HIV-1 protease activity assay. PC-pepstatin
A beads (Figure S5) served as the positive
control. Droplets combining protease, fluorogenic peptide substrate
and inhibitor beads were exposed with UV light (0.95 J/cm2) in the illumination region, incubated (∼25 min), and detected
using confocal LIF. A histogram analysis of ∼240 000
droplets over 90 min (Figure 5A) revealed the presence of several distinct populations.
Empty droplets (no beads, brown) exhibited the highest fluorescence
due to uninhibited proteolysis of the fluorogenic substrate while
droplets with 1 bead (red), 2 beads (blue), and 3+ beads (yellow)
exhibited diminished fluorescence as larger doses of pepstatin A resulted
in increased inhibition of HIV-1 protease activity. Histogram analysis
confirmed the stochastic nature of bead distribution.16 Histograms of 3 min windows of data were integrated to
determine the total number of droplets in each population (empty,
1-bead, etc.) and the average beads/droplet for each time point in
order to compare the observed bead distribution with the expected
Poisson distribution (Figure 5B). Bead distribution for PC-pepstatin A beads exhibits consistent
deviation from Poisson; there is an abundance of empty and multibead
droplets accompanied by a dearth in 1-bead droplets throughout the
experiment.

Figure 5 Droplet-based HIV-1 protease activity assay. (A) Histogram analysis
of the droplet assay distribution included ∼240 000
droplets, which were irradiated with UV light (0.95 J/cm2) and incubated (∼25 min) prior to detection. Empty droplet
fluorescence intensities (brown) differ significantly from fluorescence
of droplets occupied with 1 (red), 2 (blue), or 3+ (yellow) PC-pepstatin
A inhibitor beads. Histogram data derived from occupied droplets were
magnified (30-fold) for display. (B) The initial encounter probabilities
deviate from the Poisson distribution. Deviations decrease over the
course of the experiment as the bead introduction rate slows.

Deviations from the Poisson distribution
are likely attributed
to the nature of the PC-pepstatin A beads. We observed that hydrophobic
PC-pepstatin A beads form large clumps (25+ beads) as they sediment
within the suspension hopper, only breaking up in shear flow after
entering the microfluidic circuit. This produces periods of time with
sparse bead introduction interspersed with short bursts of high-volume
bead introduction, producing the observed effect. The presence of
0.1% Tween-80 in the aqueous phase slightly abated bead clumping.
However, every bead displayed the same hydrophobic compound, which
is a highly artificial scenario. This clumping behavior is not observed
with hydrophilic PC-FAM beads. Furthermore, OBOC libraries feature
>105 different compounds, each displayed on 10-μm
resin with large, polyanionic DNA-encoding tags,29 which will not likely exhibit the same bead clumping behavior
seen here.

Dose-Dependent Droplet
Screening
By modifying the intensity
of the LED, we were able to identify in a dose-dependent fashion conditions
that would be acceptable for a high-throughput HIV-1 protease activity
assay-based compound library screen. Increasing the LED intensity
incrementally generated slugs of droplets containing increasing doses
of pepstatin A. Histogram analyses (Figure 6) of droplet slugs that experienced one of
five different UV exposures exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of
proteolytic activity in all droplet-bead populations. Absent UV exposure,
the droplet fluorescence distribution clusters as a single peak that
corresponds to uninhibited protease activity (top red trace, >
8000
counts/sample). When the UV exposure is 0.02 J/cm2, the
fluorescence profiles of bead-occupied droplets begin to differentiate
from those of empty droplets. At a UV exposure of 0.60 J/cm2, HIV-1 protease activity in 1-bead droplets has decreased ∼30%,
resulting in a Z-factor of 0.83. This assay performance easily exceeds
the threshold (Z factor = 0.5) designating an assay’s ability
to identify compounds at least as active as the positive control.
At higher doses, protease activity falls to approximately half compared
to the uninhibited enzyme, while Z-factor remains relatively constant.

Figure 6 Online
dose–response analysis of assay droplet populations.
Photochemical pepstatin A dosing in an HIV-1 protease biochemical
activity assay results in a UV dose-dependent decrease in % enzyme
activity (blue) and a rapid increase and plateau of Z-factor (gray).
Z-factor is robust for screening (>0.5) and unchanging for all
doses
>0.02 J/cm2, defining the window of appropriate dose–response
screening conditions for the device. The histograms compile raw data
for >34 000 total droplets at each dose. Enzyme activity
and
Z-factor were calculated only for 1-bead droplets. The vertical position
of the dashed line in each histogram represents 4000 droplets.

The peak corresponding to empty
droplets does not drift as a function
of both time and UV exposure, demonstrating assay stability in a high-throughput
droplet-based screen. With automated and graduated UV exposure, screening
thousands of droplets enables high-throughput assay development since
concentration-dependent Z-factors can be calculated to assess positive
control efficacy and enzyme activity. This system creates a “plug-and-play”
approach to assay development and compound library analysis. For instance,
with PC-pepstatin A beads in hand, we can quickly evaluate droplet-based
assays for other aspartyl proteases, including cathepsin D (breast
cancer), β-secretase (Alzheimer’s disease), and plasmepsin
(malaria). With any such qualified assay, microfluidic hνSABR can be used to perform a preliminary
hit rate analysis to determine the most advantageous chemical space
for high-resolution photochemical dose–response screening using
a droplet sorting device30 and structure
elucidation.29

Conclusions
Combinatorial
synthesis can generate large compound libraries,
but screening focuses on target binding and introduces its own significant
analytical challenges. Conventional combinatorial OBOC library screening
entails incubating the library with fluorescently labeled target,
isolating fluorescent beads, and elucidating hit structures. All downstream
hit validation, such as determination of binding affinity and functional
assays, is predicated on identification of authentic binders during
the primary surface-binding screen. However, high false positive rates
plague solid-phase binding assays,31,32 which has
driven the development of strategies that reduce surface ligand density
to mitigate avidity-based enhancement of binding,32,33 challenge putative hits to exhibit reproducible binding to replicate
compound beads in a redundant library,34 or validate in microanalytical fluorescence polarization assay.35 The importance of hit authenticity cannot be
overstated because secondary assays almost always require cost- and
labor-intensive resynthesis. Investigating false positives wastes
significant effort that would otherwise be utilized investigating
whether the authentic primary binding events translate to function
(e.g., enzyme inhibition, receptor agonism).36

Directly screening a library for desired function with hνSABR circumvents many OBOC library
screening challenges while creating new opportunities for small molecule
discovery. While our assay involved enzyme inhibition, a common functional
screening mode, integrating recent advances in droplet-scale fluorescence
polarization detection technology37 should
yield more robust off-bead screening for high-affinity binding interactions.
Furthermore, UV dose-dependent compound release has the potential
to recapitulate dose-dependent “quantitative” high-throughput
screening,38 which evaluates compounds
on potency and efficacy instead of a single end point. The increased
number of assays per compound required to generate such powerful whole-library
structure–activity relationship (SAR) data drives up cost and
limits library size when conducted in microplates. The miniaturization
afforded by picoliter-scale droplets should enable screening campaigns
that identify trends in whole-library SAR for large compound collections
(>105 members). By integrating controllable and reproducible
compound dosing (0.1—10 μM) with incubation and LIF detection, hνSABR represents a key technological
advance toward a sustainable next-generation HTS platform.
