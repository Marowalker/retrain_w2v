Cross-linking/mass spectrometry has
evolved into a robust technology
that reveals structural insights into proteins and protein complexes.
We leverage a new tribrid instrument with improved fragmentation capacities
in a systematic comparison to identify which fragmentation method
would be best for the identification of cross-linked peptides. Specifically,
we explored three fragmentation methods and two combinations: collision-induced
dissociation (CID), beam-type CID (HCD), electron-transfer dissociation
(ETD), ETciD, and EThcD. Trypsin-digested, SDA-cross-linked human
serum albumin (HSA) served as a test sample, yielding over all methods
and in triplicate analysis in total 2602 matched PSMs and 1390 linked
residue pairs at 5% false discovery rate, as confirmed by the crystal
structure. HCD wins in number of matched peptide-spectrum-matches
(958 PSMs) and identified links (446). CID is most complementary,
increasing the number of identified links by 13% (58 links). HCD wins
together with EThcD in cross-link site calling precision, with approximately
62% of sites having adjacent backbone cleavages that unambiguously
locate the link in both peptides, without assuming any cross-linker
preference for amino acids. Overall quality of spectra, as judged
by sequence coverage of both peptides, is best for EThcD for the majority
of peptides. Sequence coverage might be of particular importance for
complex samples, for which we propose a data dependent decision tree,
else HCD is the method of choice. The mass spectrometric raw data
has been deposited in PRIDE (PXD003737).

==== Body
Current methods
of structural
biology have left a systematic and large gap in our knowledge of protein
structures.1 Cross-linking/mass spectrometry
(CLMS) is an emerging tool that helps to gain structural information
for challenging proteins and protein complexes. In CLMS experiments,
protein complexes are chemically cross-linked, digested into peptides,
and then analyzed via mass spectrometry and bioinformatics.2−5 Identifying a cross-linked peptide pair or the linked residues within,
defines their maximal distance in the folded protein. The derived
distance constraints can then be used to determine the low-resolution
arrangement of protein complexes4,6,7 or even the high-resolution structure of a protein by the help of
computational modeling.8

To identify
cross-linked peptides, fragmentation spectra have to
be matched with peptide sequences by database search. For this purpose,
a number of tools have been developed,9,10 for example,
pLINK,11 Protein Prospector,12,13 StavroX,14 xQuest,15 Kojak,16 Xi,6,17 or
even search engines18 based on linear peptide
identification search paradigms such as Mascot.19 One of the challenges in identifying cross-linked peptides
is the unequal fragmentation of the two linked peptides,13,17 that is, often one of the two peptides is better fragmented and
thus also better characterized by fragment ions. Under collision-induced
dissociation (CID) conditions this has been investigated in more detail,
revealing that the intensity of observed fragment ions is also affected.17 This is important for the scoring of cross-linked
peptides since in general the number of identified fragment ions and
their intensity is used for spectra matching. Despite the obvious
disadvantage of the unequal fragmentation, scoring mechanisms managed
to successfully exploit this fact: To judge the complete cross-linked
peptide-spectrum match (PSM), the two individual peptide scores are
weighted differently.13,16 However, this should only be
an ad hoc solution; ideally the experimental setup can be changed
in such a way that the sequence coverage for both peptides is increased.
It is plausible that one of the available fragmentation methods performs
better than the others, and a comparative analysis into the behavior
of cross-linked peptides might reveal options for a refined acquisition
strategy.

Throughout the manuscript we use CID for resonant
excitation CID
in the linear ion trap and HCD as the abbreviation for beam-type CID
(HCD is also often referred to as higher-energy collisional dissociation).
CID is one of the standard methods of fragmenting peptides in proteomics
and has been used in many CLMS studies.6,20−24 The details of CID of cross-linked peptides have recently been systematically
assessed,17 but a systematic comparison
to other fragmentation methods such as HCD is lacking. HCD has also
been used in many CLMS studies.11,13,25,26 Neither a systematic analysis
of cross-linked peptides under HCD exists nor under electron-transfer
dissociation (ETD). ETD-based fragmentation, that is, ETD with and
without supplemental activation of CID (ETciD) or HCD (EThcD)27 has neither routinely been applied to cross-linked
peptides nor investigated in much detail. A sequential fragmentation
scheme of CID and ETD is reported to increase the identification and
confidence levels of cross-linked peptides.28 Another study acquired sequential CID and ETD fragmentation spectra
as an optimized method for CID cleavable cross-linkers with signature
peaks. Both spectra are then matched with their appropriate ion types
and scored together, yielding an improved sequence coverage compared
to CID alone.29 Search strategies for noncleavable
cross-linkers, however, do not rely on the detection of signature
peaks, and thus, the time for the reisolation of the precursor can
be saved by simply using ETD with supplemental activation. It was
also shown that ETD alone can generate good ion coverage for both
peptides using a novel cross-linker,30 albeit
the effect on peptides cross-linked with another cross-linker remains
to be investigated. In contrast, ETD has been used frequently for
complete proteins31 or to characterize
post-translational modifications (since it leaves the often labile
peptide modifications intact32). Earlier
studies stated that ETD fragment peptides with charge states higher
than two, more extensively than CID.33 However,
the underlying effect seems to correlate with the mass-to-charge ratio
(m/z) of the precursors.34 For cross-linked peptides, we expect highly
charged precursors6,15,18 and, thus, potentially well-suited targets for ETD.

High-sequence
coverage is important to ensure selectivity during
database search when trying to identify the two cross-linked peptides
from the large choice of alternatives offered by the database. Good
backbone fragmentation should also be beneficial to pinpoint the exact
location of the cross-link. Despite being the intuitive expectation,
sequence coverage and site calling precision do not necessarily have
to be linked directly. Properties of the linkage site might direct
fragmentation toward neighboring backbone bonds or away from them.
Also, for amine-reactive cross-linkers, pinpointing the exact position
of the cross-link is assisted by the restricted chemical reactivity
toward lysine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, or the protein N-terminus.
Hence, depending on the peptide sequence there might only be a single
amino acid amenable to the cross-linker reaction. For highly reactive
cross-linkers such as succinimidyl 4,4-azipentanoate (SDA) each residue
in a peptide needs to be considered when locating the linkage site.
Therefore, pinpointing the cross-link sites potentially requires more
complete backbone fragmentation than for more specific cross-linkers.

In this study we compared three different fragmentation techniques
and two combined fragmentation schemes available on a novel tribrid
mass spectrometer (Orbitrap Fusion Lumos, Thermo Fisher Scientific),
CID, HCD, ETD, ETciD, and EThcD, on cross-linked peptides obtained
by tryptic cleavage of SDA-cross-linked human serum albumin (HSA).
The three-dimensional structure of HSA has been resolved by X-ray
crystallography35 and is used as ground-truth
to evaluate the identification results. The right choice of fragmentation
method allows the number of identified linkage sites to be increased;
increasing the sequence coverage of both linked peptides boosts the
confidence of the matches and also the correct localization of the
cross-link site.

Methods
Sample Preparation
Purified HSA (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) was cross-linked using different cross-linker-to-protein,
weight-to-weight (w/w) ratios: 0.152:1, 0.203:1, 0.303:1, 0.406:1,
0.606:1, 0.811:1, 1.21:1, and 1.62:1. Aliquots of purified HSA (15
μg, 0.75 mg/mL) in cross-linking buffer (20 mM HEPES–OH,
20 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.8) were mixed with sulfo-SDA
(Thermo Scientific Pierce, Rockford, IL) to initiate incomplete reaction
of the protein with the sulfo-NHS ester component of the cross-linker.
Human blood serum from a healthy donor (20 μg, 1.0 mg/mL) was
cross-linked in a similar manner, using cross-linker-to-protein ratios
(w/w) of 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1. Total reaction volume in each case
was 30 μL. For the second step of the cross-linking procedure,
photoactivation of the diazirine group was carried out using UV irradiation
from a UVP CL-1000 UV Cross-linker (UVP Inc.). Samples were irradiated
for either 25 or 50 min for purified HSA samples, and either 10, 20,
40, or 60 min in the case of blood serum samples and separated using
gel electrophoresis. Bands corresponding to monomeric HSA were excised
from gels and the proteins reduced with DTT, alkylated using IAA,
and digested using trypsin following standard protocols.18 Peptides were loaded onto self-made C18 StageTips36 and eluted using 80% acetonitrile and 20%, 0.1%
TFA in water. The eluates from blood serum HSA and purified HSA digests
were mixed 0.33:1 as a master mix to be used throughout this study.
The two samples originally used in our structural analysis of HSA8 were mixed here to gain enough material to perform
the experiments of this study in triplicates.

Data Acquisition
Peptides were loaded directly (2%
B, 500 nL/min) onto a spray emitter analytical column (75 μm
inner diameter, 8 μm opening, 250 mm length; New Objectives)
packed with C18 material (ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 3 μm; Dr Maisch
GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany) using an air pressure pump (Proxeon
Biosystems).37 The 0.1% formic acid served
as mobile phase A and 0.1% formic acid/80% acetonitrile as mobile
phase B. Peptides were eluted (200 nL/min, linear gradient of 2–40%
B over 139 min) directly into an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass
spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Survey spectra
were recorded in the Orbitrap at 120000 resolution. Spectra for all
fragmentation methods were acquired using a scan range of 300–1700 m/z. Precursor ion isolation was performed
with the quadrupole and an m/z window
of 1.6 Th. The precursor automatic gain control (AGC) target value
was 4 × 105, maximum injection time 50 ms. For CID
only, CID collision energy was set to 30%. For HCD only, HCD collision
energy was set to 35%. For ETD only, the option to inject ions for
all available parallelizable time was selected (anion AGC 5 ×
104, 60 ms maximum injection time). Supplemental activation
(SA) collision energy was set to 10% for ETciD, and 25% for EThcD.

Data Analysis
Raw files were preprocessed with MaxQuant
(v. 1.5.2.8) with “Top MS/MS peaks per 100 Da” set to
100.38 Resulting peak files (APL format)
were subjected to Xi (ERI Edinburgh, v. 1.5.584) and searched with
the following settings: MS accuracy, 6 ppm; MS/MS accuracy, 20 ppm;
enzyme, trypsin; max. missed cleavages, 4; max. number of modifications,
3; fixed modification, none; variable modifications, carbamidomethylation
on cysteine; oxidation on methionine; cross-linker, SDA (mass modification:
109.0396 Da). In addition, variable modifications by the hydrolyzed
cross-linker (“SDA-hyd”, mass modification: 82.0413
Da) and loop-links (“SDA-loop”, mass modification: 83.0491
Da) were allowed. SDA cross-link reactions were assumed to connect
lysine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, or the protein N-terminus on
the one end of the spacer with any other amino acid on the other end.
FDR was estimated using XiFDR (v. 1.0.6.14)39 on a 5% peptide spectrum match (PSM) level and 5% link-level only
including unique PSMs. The reference database consisted of a single
entry with the protein sequence of HSA (Uniprot: P02768). For further
analysis, PSM information (precursor m/z, annotated fragments, score, peptide sequences, etc.) were extracted
from a local PostgreSQL database. The annotated spectra are available
in the Supporting Information (Figures S4–S8).

To derive a decision tree for an optimized fragmentation
scheme for cross-linked peptides we divided the acquisition range
into a grid of m/z bins of size
200 for each charge state from 3 to 7. After sorting all PSMs into
this theoretical grid we assigned each cell the best performing and
second best performing fragmentation method. The performance was assessed
through the median achieved sequence coverage of the complete cross-linked
peptide. Note, sequence coverage does not depend on the possible fragment
ions but rather on the actual evidence (fragment ions) for specific
n-terminal or c-terminal sequences. To decide whether or not a fragmentation
method is favorable over another we conducted a simple, one-sided
permutation test40 with label swaps and
10.000 iterations. P values lower than 0.05 were
regarded as significant. Permutation tests were only performed if
more than 15 observations were in the best performing class. If the
best and second best were too similar to give significant results
the best performing method was also compared to all other methods.

All raw files are available via the PRIDE repository41 (PDX: PXD003737) along with PSM results and
the reference FASTA.

Results and Discussion
We investigated
the impact of five fragmentation techniques (CID,
HCD, ETD, EThcD, ETciD) on the analysis of cross-linked peptides using
a latest generation Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Orbitrap Fusion Lumos,
Thermo Fisher Scientific). HSA was used as a model protein with a
known crystal structure. Cross-linking experiments suffer under CID
conditions from the underrepresentation of fragment ions from one
of the two peptides.13,17 Here we define the peptide with
more intense ions among the ten most intense fragment ions as the
α-peptide and the remaining peptide as the β-peptide.17 Note that the nomenclature for the two peptides
in a cross-link is not standardized; other definitions using the achieved
search score13 or the peptide’s
chain length or mass4 are used. We hypothesized
that the usage of other fragmentation techniques has an impact on
the fragmentation pattern of cross-linked peptides and subsequently
on the success rate of identification. In our analysis we applied
two different FDR-levels according to the descriptive features that
we evaluated.39 For the evaluation of identification
results on the crystal structure, a link-level FDR is used. For the
evaluation of PSM properties (e.g., sequence coverage), a regular
PSM FDR is used. An overview is available in Table S1.

HCD Fragmentation Gives the Highest Number of Identified Cross-Links
We compared the number of identified cross-links that passed a
5% link-level FDR and a 5% PSM-level FDR to assess which fragmentation
approach leads to the highest identification success. The results,
accumulating the three technical replicates for all fragmentation
techniques, show that HCD (958 PSMs) gives the highest number of identifications
followed by CID (604 PSMs, Figure 1A). ETciD fragmentation achieves the lowest number
of identified cross-links with 296 PSMs. This order is closely related
to the number of acquired spectra in all replicates. While HCD is
the fastest acquisition technique producing ∼109000 MS2 spectra
ETciD and ETD only produce ∼80000 spectra (Table S1). While the number of PSMs is only a proxy for the
success of CLMS experiments, the true value of CLMS data comes from
the corresponding distance constraints. Therefore, for the comparison
of cross-linking data it makes sense to compare the results on the
link-level. For the comparison on the link-level only unique links
are regarded for further analysis. A unique link is defined by the
combination of residues involved in a cross-link, that is, a unique
residue pair.

Figure 1 Number of SDA-induced cross-links identified in HSA using
different
fragmentation techniques. (A) Identified PSMs and links were computed
for 5% FDR-level on the respective category. (B) Evaluation of the
identified cross-links against the crystal structure of HSA. The light
gray distribution reflects the distance measurement between identified
residues in a cross-link mapped to the crystal structure (the median
is shown above the vertical line). The dark gray distribution reflects
all pairwise combinations of cross-linkable residues in the crystal
structure. The black vertical line at 25 Å is used to classify
cross-links as long distance or not.

As is the case for PSMs, HCD fragmentation also returns the
highest
number of identified links (Figure 1A). In total 1390 links (972 unique) were identified
with the various methods: Of the unique links HCD observed 446 links
(46%), CID 297 links (31%), EThCD 240 links (25%), ETciD 205 links
(21%), and ETD 202 (21%). Note, the comparison of the links is not
straightforward if the cross-link site is ambiguous. We applied a
simple heuristic that assigns the linkage site to the c-terminal residue
in ambiguous linkage windows. As HSA’s three-dimensional structure
has been resolved, it is possible to utilize it as ground truth and
further evaluate the quality of the identified links. We used 25 Å
here for SDA as the maximal α-carbon distance of two linkable
amino acids in the three-dimensional structure. This provides a clear
distinction between true positive and false positive identifications.
Each identified link that lies within 25 Å in the crystal structure
is plausibly a true positive. Accordingly, every link that is further
than 25 Å apart is plausibly a false positive. This is a simplified
approach, as links shorter than 25 Å will also contain false
positives as a result of random matching, and conversely, longer links
may be true and result from protein structural flexibility. Comparing
the link information from all five fragmentation techniques shows
that the overall quality of the results is comparable across all fragmentation
modes and distinctly different from random results. The derived distance
distributions have a median of 12–13 Å and are very distinct
from the random distance distribution (Figure 1B). In addition, the results are comparable
in meeting the approximated 5% FDR. FDR analysis for the HCD data
and the ETciD data slightly underestimates the number of false positives
by 1% and 2.5%, respectively (Figure S1). These can be partially explained by the definition of the FDR
itself, which only gives an approximation of the true false discovery
rate. Furthermore, the hard cutoff that was used has a large impact
on the computed FDR. For example, the ETciD distances showed a larger
peak just to the right of the desired distance cutoff, indicating
that a small increase in the maximal allowed distance would give an
FDR closer to the desired 5%. The HCD distance distribution looks
similar to a small enrichment of false positives just outside the
maximal allowed distance. Thus, accounting for more flexibility would
change the FDR and suggests that the different methods lead to data
of comparable quality but different quantity.

Having a preranking
of the individual fragmentation techniques
in terms of number of PSMs and unique cross-links is desirable to
maximize the information content in a single run. Depending on the
peptide properties, some fragmentation methods might be more suited
for a certain group of peptides, and thus, using two (or more) orthogonal
fragmentation techniques may increase the overall yield in peptide
identifications and thus distance constraints. Disregarding the link
information to focus first on the identified peptide pairs shows that
HCD fragmentation also yields the largest number of unique peptide
pairs (Figure 2A).
A total of 43% (201 peptide pairs) are shared between at least two
fragmentation techniques. The remaining 57% (269 peptide pairs) are
unique to one of the five fragmentation techniques. To maximize the
information content, HCD should be combined with CID fragmentation
to increase the number of unique links by 58 (Figure 2B). Interestingly, ETD fragmentation can
maximally increase the number of unique links by 41 by using EThcD.
We suspect that the difference in the number of acquired spectra and
actually identified PSMs is the main driver for this effect. We define
the identification rate, IR, as , where Nid is
the number of identified unique PSMs and Nacq is the total number of acquired MS2 spectra (Table S1). The IR reveals that HCD not only acquires most
spectra, but also has the highest success rate of 0.88% compared to
CID (0.61%), EThcD (0.52%), and ETD/ETciD (0.38%). If speed and reliability
of ETD-based fragmentation should change in the future, this order
of complementarity may change. In comparison with linear peptide identifications,
where the IR reaches up to 54%42 (depending
on the instrumentation), the success rate of cross-link identification
is much lower. A contributing factor will be the generally low abundance
of cross-linked peptides when compared to linear peptides, which will
reduce their frequency of selection for MS2, especially in competition
with the linear peptides also present. Other factors will include
poorer database matching due to often lower intensity, but also more
complex spectra and a larger search space.

ETD-Aided Fragmentation
Improves the Coverage of the Second
Peptide
The identification of cross-linked peptides poses
two challenges: First, finding the correct peptide pair, and second,
assigning the correct cross-link site. High peptide sequence coverage
for both individual peptides should be beneficial to assigning the
correct site. Site calling will be especially challenging when considering
cross-linkers such as SDA, where the number of cross-link target sites
is large.

Under HCD conditions the coverage distribution for
the α-peptide is the lowest, with a mean coverage around 50%
(Figure 3A). The other
four fragmentation techniques perform very similar to only small improvements
in the coverage of the α-peptide with CID or EThcD fragmentation.
Interestingly, ETD involving fragmentation schemes do not increase
the fragmentation efficiency (measured by the peptide coverage) much
for the α-peptide. In fact, the highest coverage values for
the α-peptide were observed with CID fragmentation. In contrast,
the sequence coverage for the beta peptide largely depends on the
fragmentation method (Figure 3B). ETD, ETciD, EThcD, and HCD show a much better fragmentation
compared to CID. Previously, ETD was reported to improve the sequence
coverage compared to CID.32,43 We observe here that
for cross-linked peptides this effect is very pronounced for the β-peptide,
but not for the α-peptide.

Figure 3 Achieved sequence coverage comparison.
Coverage distribution of
the α-peptide (A; more matches among the 10 most intense fragment
ions) and the β-peptide (B). The vertical line in (A)–(C)
reflects a reference value of 50% sequence coverage, meaning fragments
(b, c, y, or z) match to half of the backbone links between residues
along the sequence of the peptide. (C) Coverage distribution for the
complete cross-linked peptide. (D) Symmetry (absolute coverage difference
between alpha and beta peptide) distributions for the different fragmentation
techniques. The data in (A)–(D) were analyzed using a 5% PSM
FDR.

In general, in cross-linked peptides,
one peptide matches more
and with higher intense fragment ions than the other. All fragmentation
methods yield at least an average coverage of around 50% for the α-peptide.
For the β-peptide, the average coverage lies between 39% and
50%. CID would be the method of choice for high α-peptide coverage.
However, CID is systematically disadvantaging the β-peptide.
For the β-peptide, the other fragmentation methods perform much
better: EThcD and HCD almost reach the same fragmentation efficiency
as for the α-peptide. In numbers, the largest discrepancy between
α- and β-peptide coverage was observed with CID, with
a mean coverage difference (MCD) of 19%. EThCD and HCD show the lowest
MCD of 8%. The overall best coverage is observed with EThcD fragmentation
(Figure 3C). ETciD
seems to be less effective, presumably as ETD in the first stage leads
to charge reduction, and CID then fragments a single precursor, while
HCD fragments all. Nevertheless, ETciD greatly improves the coverage
of the second peptide when compared to CID.

To compare the fragmentation
efficiency on both peptides in a cross-link
more systematically, we define the symmetry factor (SF) as 1  where covα and covβ refer to the sequence coverage of the α- and
β-beta
peptide, respectively. For convenience, we use the negation SF′
of SF defined as 2  

A large SF′ means
that α- and β-peptide coverage
are very similar and vice versa. CID shows the smallest among the
five fragmentation methods of ∼0.8. The other four methods
perform better than CID, with a median of ∼0.9 (Figure 3D). In addition, ETD, ETciD,
EThcD, and HCD have a smaller spread than CID. In summary, CID exasperates
the second peptide problem. Nevertheless, CID still slightly outperforms
HCD in overall cross-linked peptide sequence coverage. In order to
maximize overall cross-linked peptide coverage ETD, ETciD, and EThcD
are recommended, based on median coverage of the complete cross-linked
peptide.

Precursor m/z Has a Large
Effect on the Efficiency of the Fragmentation
To follow-up
on the different fragmentation behavior of cross-linked peptides we
investigated how the precursor properties influence the fragmentation
efficiency. We first divided the m/z acquisition range into bins of m/z 150 (starting from m/z 550). For
each bin we then collected the peptide identifications of all different
fragmentation methods and investigated the sequence coverage based
on the m/z of the precursor.

ETD and EThcD lead to the highest sequence coverage between m/z 500–800 (Figure 4A,B). However, ETD efficiency decreases steeply
with higher m/z, making HCD and
CID the better choice for precursors larger than m/z 1000. The same trend is observed for all ETD-based
methods. These differences are more pronounced on the individual α-
and β-peptides. When the complete peptide coverage is compared
(Figure 4C), all methods
stick more closely together but EThcD and ETD still outperform all
other methods for precursors smaller than m/z 850. In higher m/z areas,
only CID and HCD are able to still produce enough peptide identifications
(data in the figure was limited to only include m/z bins with at least five observations).

Figure 4 Sequence coverage
depending on precursor m/z and charge.
The average coverage values from (A) α-peptides,
(B) β-peptides, and (C) the complete cross-linked peptide are
plotted vs the precursor m/z. Each
dot represents the median of all identified peptides in a window of m/z 150. Error bars show the standard deviation.
(D) Decision surface to optimize the sequence coverage of cross-linked
peptide. The acquisition range was divided into bins of 200 m/z per charge state. In each bin the best
performing fragmentation method (judged by median achieved sequence
coverage) is used to color that particular bin. The “*”
denotes a significant improvement in sequence coverage by using the
best performing fragmentation method over the second best. Areas with
less than 15 observations are colored in light red, falling back to
HCD as standard fragmentation technique. Gray annotations show areas
where no significant improvement could be obtained by choosing one
method over the others.

As demonstrated in the sections above, there are differences
in
the efficiency of the fragmentation of cross-linked peptides. In a
more detailed comparison, we divided the acquisition range into a
grid made of charge bins of size one and m/z bins of size 200. In each of these cells we then tested
how well the five different fragmentation methods performed. The performance
was evaluated on the cross-linked peptide sequence coverage. For the
majority of peptides, EThcD achieved significantly higher sequence
coverage (Figure 4D)
than the second best method between 600 and 800 m/z (precursor charge 3–6). In addition, the m/z cells 400–600 (z = 4) and 800–1000 (z = 5) are also favored
by EThcD fragmentation. Since the majority of cross-linked peptides
(71%) lie within 600–1000 m/z, the most important area is dominated by EThcD fragmentation. However,
evaluated by pure numbers of identifications, EThcD is not the best
performing method. On average, ∼35 PSMs are missed if EThcD
is chosen over the method that achieves the highest number of identifications.
If the evaluation metric is changed to the highest number of identifications,
HCD is outperforming the other fragmentation methods for all m/z bins (Figure S3). Therefore, HCD was selected as default method for regions where
no significant improvement could be observed by any of the other methods
(Figure 4D, HCD written
in gray).

HCD, EThcD, and ETD fragmentation define the cross-link site
most unambiguously
The overall sequence coverage is a valuable
feature to assess the quality of peptide identifications. However,
for cross-linked peptides those fragments flanking the cross-linked
residues are important to define the linkage site. This resembles
the localization of post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation,
which greatly benefited from the usage of combined fragmentation methods.44 Limited information about the cross-link site
is available when none of the fragments next to a cross-linked residue
are observed; the cross-link site can then only be assigned by prior
assumptions or to larger sequence windows, which becomes problematic
if the site call is off by ±5 residues (at least in HSA and using
current ab initio structure computation).8 Given the information from correct fragment identifications, a combination
of one c-terminal and one n-terminal ion is enough to locate the cross-link
site unambiguously. Utilizing the high-resolution/accurate mass measurement
in our experimental design, we thus assumed that each assigned fragment
is correct for peptides passing the specified FDR.

The cross-link
site in α-peptides could be assigned to a single residue in
∼65% of all PSMs identified with EThcD or HCD (Figure 5A). The second best performing
method was ETD, with approximately 60% of PSMs where the cross-link
could be assigned to a single residue. CID and ETciD PSMs show the
lowest number of accurate site localizations to a single residue (below
50% of all PSMs). All methods placed the cross-link site on average
within the critical 5 residue window for 97.2% ± 1.17 (α-peptides)
and 95.6% ± 1.3 (β-peptides) of all PSMs. For the β-peptide,
this looks very similar; EThcD and HCD show the best fragmentation
behavior to localize the cross-link site (Figure 5B). With approximately 50% of precisely localized
cross-links in the β-peptide, the link-localization is less
well for the β-peptide than for the α-peptide. However,
this is not as pronounced as would be expected from the sequence coverage
asymmetry. This is counterintuitive since the coverage distributions
for HCD is among the lowest of all five fragmentation techniques for
the β-peptide. For EThcD, the results for the determination
of the cross-link site are more in line with the observed coverage
distributions. Still, the large difference in the coverage distribution
of the α- and β-peptides seems not to be as pronounced
for the distribution of correct localizations of the cross-link site.
One of the possible reasons is that the cleavage of the peptides before
and after the cross-link site is preferred. For CID a statistical
trend was reported that cross-linked fragments outnumber linear fragments
and tend to have a higher intensity.17 We
encounter the opposite for HCD, linear fragments visibly outnumber
cross-linked fragments (Figure S8).

site localization precision. (A) Cumulative precision
curve for the α-peptide. (B) Cumulative precision curve for
the β-peptide. With a precision value of one the cross-link
site is unambiguously located by adjacent backbone fragments (b, c,
y, or z) in the peptide. A value of two limits the cross-link site
to two eligible residues.

Data-Dependent Decision Tree for Optimized Acquisition of Cross-Linked
Peptides
CLMS studies vary in the degree of complexity: single
proteins, multiple protein complexes or complete proteomes can be
analyzed to generate protein–protein interaction information
or the three-dimensional structure. Depending on the specific case
we propose two different acquisition strategies (Figure 6A): First, for single proteins
or small protein complexes, we recommend HCD as the method of choice.
Since the complexity of the sample is not very high, cross-linked
peptides can often be matched by precursor mass alone. In addition,
HCD fragmentation generates enough fragments to precisely localize
the cross-link site in the majority of cases. For the second case,
that is, complex samples with many proteins not only the search space
becomes an issue but also the associated random matches. A fragmentation
scheme that generates highly discriminative scores for target and
decoy peptides will identify more peptides under the same FDR threshold.
The optimal fragmentation scheme for such an experiment is shown in Figure 6B. Earlier studies
on the development of data dependent decision trees (DDDT) for the
acquisition of linear peptides mainly support our conclusions: HCD
gives the highest number of identifications, but ETD gives higher
search engine scores45 or, as in our case,
higher sequence coverage. Compared to a DDDT for linear peptides our
results are slightly different but still comparable. For example,
linear DDDTs precursors with charge state 3+ have been analyzed with
ETD up to 750 m/z46 or 650 m/z,45 we only use ETD from 600–800 m/z. In addition, instead of using ETD
alone for 4+, 5+ precursors below 1000 m/z and 800 m/z, respectively,
EThcD is used. In this study we investigated SDA-cross-linked, tryptic
peptides. Other cross-linkers or enzymes may lead to peptide populations
with distinct fragmentation behavior due to differences in size or
amino acid composition. Note, however, that the proposed fragmentation
scheme is similar to the decision tree for linear peptides45,46 and may therefore be of more general value.

for cross-linked peptides. (A) Recommended
acquisition scheme for cross-linking samples. (B) Data-dependent decision
tree (DDDT) for cross-linked peptides. Depending on the precursor
charge state (3+, 4+, 5+, 6+, and other) and the m/z, the appropriate fragmentation technique is selected.

Conclusion
For
the majority of the peptides EThcD is the method of choice
to achieve the highest sequence coverage. HCD is an important alternative
because of its superior speed, with only somewhat reduced peptide
sequence coverage. CID, ETD, and ETciD only play minor roles. We advise
to adjust the acquisition scheme to follow the experimental setup:
simple protein samples should be analyzed using only HCD to maximize
number of observed links, which starts having value in protein structure
determination.8,47 For complex samples, we propose
a decision tree that is mainly based on EThcD and HCD to maximize
search specificity.
