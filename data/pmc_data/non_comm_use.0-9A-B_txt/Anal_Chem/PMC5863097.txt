Interstitial fluid
(ISF) surrounds the cells and tissues of the
body. Since ISF has molecular components similar to plasma, as well
as compounds produced locally in tissues, it may be a valuable source
of biomarkers for diagnostics and monitoring. However, there has not
been a comprehensive study to determine the metabolite composition
of ISF and to compare it to plasma. In this study, the metabolome
of suction blister fluid (SBF), which largely consists of ISF, collected
from 10 human volunteers was analyzed using untargeted high-resolution
metabolomics (HRM). A wide range of metabolites were detected in SBF,
including amino acids, lipids, nucleotides, and compounds of exogenous
origin. Various systemic and skin-derived metabolite biomarkers were
elevated or found uniquely in SBF, and many other metabolites of clinical
and physiological significance were well correlated between SBF and
plasma. In sum, using untargeted HRM profiling, this study shows that
SBF can be a valuable source of information about metabolites relevant
to human health.

==== Body
Biomarkers
are a powerful tool
to study the entire spectrum of disease, from the ascertainment of
diagnosis, examination of disease progression, and assessment of therapeutic
benefits.1 Most commonly, biomarkers are
measured in easily accessible body fluids, such as blood, saliva,
and urine. However, there are challenges associated with these fluids.
Blood sampling by venipuncture is invasive, potentially painful, and
requires trained personnel. Biomarker concentrations in blood samples
obtained via finger pricks may be variable if not collected under
properly controlled conditions.2 Many saliva
biomarkers are detected at low concentrations, and there is potential
for interference by food or drugs.3 While
urine samples are easier to obtain than blood, urinary biomarker concentrations
can be highly variable due to differences in urine dilution.4

Although interstitial fluid (ISF) constitutes
60% of total body
fluids in humans,5 it is greatly unexplored
as a matrix for biomarker detection. ISF, which bathes and surrounds
cells and tissues of the body, is formed as plasma traverses blood
vessels and equilibrates with the cell and tissue environment (reviewed
in ref (6)). ISF provides
a means of delivering nutrients to cells, enables intercellular communication,
and removes metabolic waste.

The detection of biomarkers in
ISF has several advantages to blood,
urine, and saliva. Since ISF interacts directly with intracellular
fluid, it is possible that compounds that cannot be detected in plasma
may be detected in ISF. Unlike blood, ISF can be used for continuous
biomarker monitoring, in part because it does not clot.7,8 For example, continuous glucose monitors sample ISF to measure glucose
concentrations.9 Unlike plasma, which provides
an integrated measurement of biomarkers from multiple organ and metabolic
systems, ISF can capture changes in the local environment.10 For instance, ISF sampled from tumors has been
studied as a source of cancer biomarkers.11,12 In addition, ISF has lower concentrations of high-abundance proteins
like albumin and globulin compared to plasma,13 which makes it easier to screen ISF for low-abundance compounds
without extensive protein depletion and sample cleanup strategies.

There are limited techniques for ISF sampling, including suction
blisters,14 microdialysis,15 open flow microperfusion,16 reverse
iontophoresis,17 and microneedle patches.18,19 Suction blisters are a common method to sample large volumes of
ISF, which are generated by applying vacuum to a skin area. A suction
application separates the dermis and epidermis, and fluid from the
surrounding tissues fills the gap, creating a blister. The blister
fluid is withdrawn by a conventional needle and syringe. This fluid,
referred to as SBF, is largely derived from ISF but may also contain
some intracellular components and inflammatory markers that are a
consequence of the collection method.20 Compared to other ISF sampling methods—including reverse
iontophoresis, wherein an electric current is applied to skin, or
microdialysis, wherein a small membrane is inserted into skin—suction
blister sampling is a relatively noninvasive method for ISF collection,
since the method requires a single needle puncture, similar to venipuncture.

The protein composition of SBF sampled from suction blisters has
been studied using mass spectrometry. From suction blisters obtained
from eight healthy individuals, Muller et al.21 found that the proteome of SBF from suction blisters was heterogeneous,
consisting of systemic plasma components, proteins originated from
cell leakage, and proteins associated with skin tissue. Comparing
proteins measured in SBF and plasma from six individuals, Kool et
al.10 found that 83% of proteins found
in plasma were also found in SBF, whereas only half of SBF proteins
were common to plasma. The authors constructed a list of 34 clinically
relevant protein biomarkers that were abundant in SBF: while 9 out
of the 34 were epidermal-derived, the rest were known systemic biomarkers,
suggesting the utility of SBF as a surrogate for blood-based biomarker
detection, as well as a source of tissue-specific biomarkers.

While previous research has explored the protein composition of
SBF, to date, no study has characterized the small-molecule composition
of SBF. Metabolites provide critical information on metabolic pathway
intermediates, disease states, and exposure to environmental agents.
Metabolite profiling is also a key tool to study the exposome, an emerging research paradigm involving the investigation of complex
environmental exposures, biological responses to these exposures,
and their impacts on human health and disease.22

Here, we profiled small-molecule metabolites in SBF
obtained from
suction blisters to better understand the composition of the SBF metabolome.
First, metabolites in plasma and SBF samples obtained from human volunteers
were analyzed using untargeted high-resolution metabolomics (HRM),23 which was used to characterize metabolites present
in SBF. Second, we performed an untargeted screen for SBF metabolites
that may be useful as biomarkers by identifying metabolite features
that were elevated in SBF and/or strongly correlated between SBF and
plasma. Collectively, the work characterizes the differences between
the SBF and plasma metabolomes, as well as the potential utility of
alternative biofluids for biomarker detection in clinical and exposome
research.

Results
Metabolomic Profiles of SBF and Plasma
To examine the
SBF and plasma metabolomes in volumes that can be feasibly sampled
in clinical settings, we compared metabolite features detected in
the volume of SBF collected via suction blister sampling (15 μL
of SBF diluted to final volume of 50 μL with LC/MS grade H2O) against 50 μL of plasma collected via venipuncture,
which is the standard sample volume used for this metabolomics assay.24 HRM detected 7044 m/z features that were present in SBF and/or plasma (Figure 1). Note that m/z features do not necessarily correspond
one-to-one with chemical compounds and may represent multiple adducts,
isotopes, or fragments from the same parent ions. Comparison of SBF
to plasma showed that the large majority of features were detected
in both biofluids, even though SBF had been diluted to provide the
minimum volume required for HRM analysis. There were 1032 and 429
features unique to plasma and SBF, respectively, where “uniqueness”
was defined as the detection of the feature in at least 1 of the 10
samples in one fluid but not in any of the 10 samples of the other
biofluid.

Venn diagram displaying the numbers of m/z features common and unique to SBF and plasma.

We identified 105 metabolites (i.e., groups of
adducts/isotopes
derived from the same parent ions) with high confidence in the SBF
samples that were matched to compounds in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database25 by
accurate mass (see Supporting Information (SI)). We also identified metabolites by comparing features to a
library of metabolite biomarkers relevant to clinical and exposome
research; compound identities were obtained by matching the accurate
mass m/z values and retention times
of the features to analytical standards in the library. The final
curated list of metabolites is presented in Table S1.

We detected a wide range of metabolites in SBF involved
in amino
acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism, as well
as clinical biomarkers such as glucose, cholesterol, creatinine, and
urea (Figure 2 and Table S1). Most endogenous metabolites were detected
in the majority of SBF samples and were present in both SBF and plasma.
We found matches for environmental toxicants, including several pesticides.
Environmental compounds were generally detected in a greater number
of plasma samples compared to SBF.

Figure displays the classes
of metabolites identified in SBF. Bars reflect the number of metabolites
detected for each class, with endogenous and environmental compounds
denoted by green and purple bars, respectively. The full list of individual
metabolites can be found in Table S1.

A limited number of metabolites
were unique to plasma (Table S2). Several
were environmental chemicals,
including the pesticides malathion, nabam, and triadimefon; ammeline,
a byproduct of the industrial compound melamine;26 and the mycotoxin aflatrem. Two metabolites were artifacts
of the venipuncture sampling: skin disinfection was carried out with
an iodine-containing compound, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA) tubes were used for blood collection.

Metabolites Markedly Elevated
in SBF
To identify unique
characteristics of the SBF metabolome, we identified features that
were elevated in SBF using a paired fold-change analysis. Since the
SBF samples were diluted, these metabolites should reflect compounds
that are greatly elevated in SBF relative to plasma. A curated list
of all unique and elevated features with putative compound matches
in the Human Metabolomics Database (HMDB)27 is presented in Table 1.

While 316 features were unique to and elevated in
SBF based on
our criteria, only 23 compounds were identified by accurate mass m/z matching (Table 1). This may be because some of the molecules
present in SBF have not yet been identified or are not included in
the HMDB database. We manually classified these metabolites into several
groups, including five phospholipids, three purines, two spermidines,
two methionine-related compounds, six other endogenous compounds,
and five dietary-derived compounds. Several of these metabolites are
promising biomarkers for human health outcomes (see Discussion). Of special note was urocanic acid, a metabolite
uniquely found in SBF (also found in Table S1). Urocanic acid is produced in the stratum corneum
and accumulates in the epidermis.28 This
finding is consistent with previous proteomic studies reporting an
enrichment of skin-derived biomarkers in SBF.10 Triethanolamine, another compound unique to SBF, is present in skin
disinfectants used during the suction blister fluid sampling. The
identification of this metabolite serves as a type of positive control,
which increases the confidence in our metabolite identities.

Metabolites
Strongly Correlated between SBF and Plasma
The identification
of metabolites that are strongly correlated between
plasma and SBF may provide insight into blood-based biomarkers that
could be reliably monitored via SBF sampling. Thus, we examined the
correlations between plasma and SBF intensities for 3141 m/z features that were present in ≥4 sample
pairs, of which 223 were significantly correlated (p < 0.05; 182 positive correlations, 41 negative correlations).

To explore the biological significance of the positively correlated
metabolites, we input the results into Mummichog29 for pathway and module analysis (Figure 3). Metabolites correlated between plasma
and SBF were commonly found in amino- acid-related pathways (e.g.,
urea cycle/amino group metabolism; glycine, serine, alanine, and threonine
metabolism; aspartate and asparagine metabolism; Figure 3A). To explore the biological
functions of the metabolites identified in the module analysis, KEGG
IDs from the significant modules were input into KEGG BRITE,25 which found numerous peptides, lipids, and hormones/neurotransmitters
among the correlated features (Figure 3B). The activity network, which contains metabolites
whose identities could be predicted with high confidence, contained
several amino acids (e.g., proline, glycine, homocysteine, betaine,
methionine, tyrosine), nucleic acids (e.g., guanosine, guanine, uracil),
and neurotransmitter-related metabolites (e.g., dopamine, methylhistamine; Figure S1)).

Figure 3 Biological roles of metabolites correlated
between SBF and plasma.
Results from Spearman correlations between SBF and plasma (for metabolite
features present in ≥4 matched sample pairs) were input into
Mummichog,29 a Python program for network
analysis and metabolite prediction in untargeted metabolomics data
sets. Significant features (p < 0.05) were matched
to compounds based on common adducts and isotopes; network modules
(i.e., subcommunities of biologically interconnected metabolites)
were identified based on their “activity scores” (calculated
from the number of significant features in the module, as well as
the Newman–Girvan modularity Q), and pathway
enrichment was estimated using a permutation procedure. (A) Metabolic
pathways over-represented among metabolites correlated between SBF
and plasma (p < 0.01). (B) Radial plot of biological
roles of metabolites identified in network modules, assessed using
KEGG BRITE. The inner and outer rings display BRITE functional hierarchies,
with the area proportionate to the number of metabolites that fall
under each category. Gray boxes outlined in the outer ring show the
number of metabolites that belong to each category.

We compared these results against metabolites identified
in a manual
annotation of highly correlated features. Here, we manually annotated
99 features with strong correlations between SBF and plasma (Spearman rho > 0.7) using HMDB (Table 2). Many metabolites were identified both
in the activity
network and Table 2, including homocysteine, betaine, methionine, proline, tyrosine,
acetylcarnitine, and octenoylcarnitine, strengthening the evidence
for these compound identifications. Results from pathway-associated
metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA)30 for metabolites in Table 2 found over-representation of metabolites in protein biosynthesis,
betaine metabolism, methionine metabolism, and glycine, serine, and
threonine metabolism (p < 0.05), consistent with
Mummichog pathway results. Metabolites annotated manually that were
not identified by Mummichog were trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a microbiota-dependent compound linking carnitine
and betaine metabolism31 that has been
identified as a promising biomarker of cardiovascular disease,32 and caffeine and trigonelline, two compounds
related to coffee consumption.33

Discussion
This study describes
the first detailed analysis of the metabolite
composition of human SBF using untargeted HRM analysis. Matched SBF
and plasma samples were collected from ten human volunteers, and clinically
relevant sample volumes were analyzed by liquid chromatography with
high-resolution mass spectrometry to find similarities and differences
between the chemical compositions of the two biofluids. Although the
majority of metabolite features were detected in both SBF and plasma,
the biofluids had distinct characteristics. A diverse range of metabolites
of endogenous and environmental origin were detected in SBF. Several
glycerophospholipid-, purine-, and spermidine-associated metabolites
were elevated in SBF, and many amino acids, nucleic acids, hormones,
and exogenous compounds were well correlated between SBF and plasma.
Altogether, our results suggest that metabolomic profiling of SBF
has the potential to provide information about local and systemic
biological activities and may be useful for monitoring established
and novel biomarkers. In some cases, metabolite detection in SBF is
a reliable proxy for blood, and in other cases, SBF contains metabolites
that are absent from, or found in lower abundance, in blood.

The large majority of endogenous metabolites in Tables S1 and S2 were detected
in both SBF and plasma, confirming that common endogenous compounds
can reliably be detected in SBF. Amino acid, lipid, and nucleotide
metabolites, along with the clinical biomarkers cholesterol, glucose,
creatinine, and urea, were detected in almost all of the SBF samples.
Among the few metabolites that were not detected in SBF, many were
environmental in origin, including several toxicants of potential
relevance to environmental health. Considering the small sample volume
of SBF used in the current study, it is possible that these metabolites
were present in SBF but too low for reliable detection using this
assay.

A primary goal of our study was to examine the usefulness
of SBF
sampling for metabolite biomarker detection as a substitute or companion
to blood sampling via venipuncture. We identified several metabolites
that were elevated in SBF compared to plasma, which reflect metabolites
that may be uniquely and/or more easily assessed in SBF. Urocanic
acid, an epidermal metabolite that accumulates in the stratum corneum,
was unique to SBF. While it is a chromophore for ultraviolet radiation
acting as a “natural sunscreen”, it has also been reported
to have immunosuppressive effects and may play a detrimental role
in photocarcinogenesis.34 Spermidine, which
has also been reported to be elevated in the epidermis,35 is a polyamine compound associated with antiaging
mechanisms.36 Spermidine has promise as
a biomarker for cancer aggressiveness,37 suicidal behavior in mood disorders,38 and response to breast cancer therapies.39 Phosphocreatinine and creatine are important components of energy
metabolism,40 and creatine has been identified
as a potential biomarker of mitochondrial diseases.41,42 Hypoxanthine and inosine, nucleotide bases formed during purine
metabolism, are increased in response to injury43 and are biomarkers for cardiac ischemia;44 however, future work should examine the impact of the suction
blister sampling protocol on the levels of these metabolites.

Several phospholipid-related compounds were elevated in SBF. Glycerophosphocholine,
a building block for phospholipids in cell membranes, is a biomarker
for breast cancer and myeloma, as well as Alzeimer’s disease.45,46 Glycerophosphocholine and glycerylphosphorylethanolamine in semen
have been implicated as biomarkers for infertility problems.47O-Phosphoethanolamine has promise
as a biomarker for major depressive disorder48 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.49

Exogenous food-based compounds were also elevated in SBF. One compound
unique to SBF, 3-methylsulfinylpropyl isothiocyanate, is obtained
through the consumption of cruciferous vegetables.50 Isothiocyanates, which are phytochemicals with chemoprotective
activities, are believed to contribute to the health benefits of vegetable-rich
diets.51 Recently, a screen for toll-like
receptor (TLR) inhibitors in vegetable extracts identified 3-methylsulfinylpropyl
isothiocyanate as a compound with potent anti-inflammatory effects.52 Another food-derived compound unique to SBF,
2,3,4-trimethyltriacontane, is found in fruits.53 While preliminary, our findings highlight the possibility
for SBF as a unique source of dietary biomarkers.

We also identified
metabolites that were positively correlated
between SBF and plasma, which reflect metabolites whose SBF levels
are informative of their blood levels. Many amino acids, neurotransmitters,
and nucleic acids were strongly correlated between the fluids. Several
clinically relevant metabolites were also strongly correlated between
SBF and plasma. Elevated homocysteine, a sensitive indictor of B-vitamin
deficiency,54 is a biomarker for cardiovascular55 and neurodegenerative56 conditions. Creatinine is an important biomarker for kidney function.40 Betaine is a metabolite that plays a role in
osmoregulation,57 and TMAO is an osmolyte
generated by gut microbiota from betaine, choline, and carnitine.58 Betaine and TMAO are biomarkers of cardiovascular
outcomes.59,60 Two dietary-related compounds, caffeine
and trigonelline, are found in coffee beans and are biomarkers of
coffee consumption.61

We acknowledge
that our study has several limitations. The limited
sample volume precluded the in-depth structural characterization of
detected m/z features without database
or library matches. The structural elucidation of these features is
challenging due to the lack of reference standards, limited SBF sample
volume, and low feature abundances. In addition, a limited number
of the annotated metabolites were identified by comparison to authentic
reference standards. The remaining metabolites were characterized
using an annotation scheme that reduces false identifications through
a combination of correlation and adduct/isotope clustering; while
this approach has been shown to enhance annotation accuracy,62 additional laboratory analyses, such as ion
dissociation and comparison to authentic reference standards, are
required for absolute confirmation of identity. We also cannot disentangle
the impacts of matrix effects and dilution effects under the current
study design.

It is possible that the different sampling sites,
i.e., blood draw
from the forearm and suction blisters on the thigh, introduced variability
in the composition of these fluids, although we do not expect this
variability to be significant since plasma is part of systemic circulation.
If metabolite concentrations across sampling sites are variable, the
interpretation of the metabolite fold changes between SBF and plasma
may have been affected. The method for suction blister generation
requires a 45 min vacuum application at elevated temperatures; due
to this procedure, host responses to blister generation, inflammatory
reactions, and wound responses may be observed, resulting in artifacts
in the SBF that would not be present in ISF from unperturbed skin.
Thus, we cannot dismiss the possibility that some of our findings
in SBF (e.g., metabolites elevated in SBF) might be influenced by
the injury induced through the suction blister sampling method. Consistent
with this hypothesis, a recent study found that plasma and ISF collected
via microneedle patches had similar proteomic compositions.63 In addition, different fluid collection protocols
may introduce variability in the metabolites detected. To address
this issue in part, future studies will explore the ISF and plasma
metabolomes with varying sample dilutions and sampling strategies.
Finally, the study had a small sample size, and we were unable to
infer how sex, age, and other participant characteristics influenced
our results. Nonetheless, the current study supports the use of SBF
as a useful fluid for biomarker monitoring using HRM approaches and
provides a framework for future clinical and exposome studies.

Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the human
SBF and plasma metabolomes with untargeted HRM profiling. We found
that SBF has a distinct metabolite composition that may provide value
as a source of biomarkers for diagnostics and monitoring. Our findings
suggest that SBF may be a unique source of several biomarkers, including
several nucleotides, epidermally derived metabolites, and dietary
compounds. Additionally, many clinical biomarkers were well correlated
between SBF and plasma, suggesting that SBF has the potential to serve
as a surrogate source of biomarkers conventionally detected in plasma.
Overall, metabolomic profiling performed in this study provides early
evidence that SBF and other alternative biofluids have the potential
to serve as a substitute and/or complement to plasma-based biomarker
detection in future clinical practice and research studies.

Methods
Obtaining
Plasma and SBF Samples
The study was conducted
using 10 healthy human volunteers and was approved by the Institutional
Review Board (IRB) at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Written
informed consent was obtained from all volunteers. Blood samples were
taken from the forearm by venipuncture. Skin suction blister fluid
was collected from suction blisters generated on the thigh by applying
suction at 50–70 kPa below atmospheric pressure at a temperature
of 40 °C for ∼45 min until blister formation was complete.
See SI for details.

High-Resolution Metabolomics
SBF samples were diluted
from 15 to 50 μL with water. A volume of 50 μL of biofluid
(plasma or diluted SBF) was added to 100 μL of acetonitrile,
vortexed, and allowed to equilibrate. Proteins were precipitated by
centrifuge. Aliquots were analyzed using reverse-phase C18 liquid chromatography (Ultimate 3000, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) and
Fourier transform mass spectrometry (Q-Exactive, Thermo Scientific,
Waltham, MA). Data was extracted using apLCMS64 with modifications by xMSanalyzer.65 See SI for details. The metabolomics data set is
available upon request to the corresponding authors.

Statistical
Analysis and Metabolite Feature Identification
Statistical
analysis, network/pathway analysis, and metabolite
set enrichment analysis were performed in RStudio v0.99.48666 and MetaboAnalyst 3.0.30 Metabolites were identified with analytical standards and accurate
mass matching in KEGG25 and HMDB27 using custom dataset-wide and feature-specific
deconvolution and identification algorithms. See SI for details.
