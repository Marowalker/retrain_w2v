The
combination of hydrodynamic focusing with embedded capillaries
in a microfluidic device is shown to enable both surface enhanced
Raman scattering (SERS) and electrochemical characterization of analytes
at nanomolar concentrations in flow. The approach utilizes a versatile
polystyrene device that contains an encapsulated microelectrode and
fluidic tubing, which is shown to enable straightforward hydrodynamic
focusing onto the electrode surface to improve detection. A polydimethyslsiloxane
(PDMS) microchannel positioned over both the embedded tubing and SERS
active electrode (aligned ∼200 μm from each other) generates
a sheath flow that confines the analyte molecules eluting from the
embedded tubing over the SERS electrode, increasing the interaction
between the Riboflavin (vitamin B2) and the SERS active electrode.
The microfluidic device was characterized using finite element simulations,
amperometry, and Raman experiments. This device shows a SERS and amperometric
detection limit near 1 and 100 nM, respectively. This combination
of SERS and amperometry in a single device provides an improved method
to identify and quantify electroactive analytes over either technique
independently.

==== Body
Microfluidic-based
devices are
increasingly being used for analysis in biological, chemical, and
biomedical applications.1,2 Reducing dimensions
down to the micrometer scale results in numerous advantages including
small sample volumes, high throughput detection, and the ability to
combine multiple processes. However, there is a strong need for the
integration of sensitive detection methods into these microfluidic
devices. Detection methods in microfluidics include optical, electrochemical,
and mass spectrometric detection.3,4 The most widely
used techniques are electrochemical and optical.

Electrochemical
detection is a popular technique for a wide range
of analytes due to the small sample volumes required, the low cost,
and the high sensitivity it provides. A range of methods can be used
including amperometry,5−7 potentiometry,8 and conductometry.9 These electrochemical methods provide great quantitative
information about the electroactive species being examined. The drawback
is the lack of chemical specificity. The exact chemical identity of
the analyte is difficult to discern.

Optical detection offers
complementary information to that of electrochemical
techniques. The common methods include fluorescence,10 absorbance,11 luminescence,12 surface plasmon resonance (SPR),13 and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).14−18 All of these techniques offer unique advantages to one another.
SERS has become an attractive method due to the ability to identify
analytes from unique Raman signatures. The signal enhancements associated
with SERS provide low detection limits, while its insensitivity to
water facilitates detection in many environments,19 making it a useful tool for examining species in
situ.

Sensitive SERS detection in a microfluidic device,
with flow, remains
difficult due to the distance dependence of the localized surface
plasmon resonance (LSPR) that originates from metallic nanostructures.20,21 The analyte of interest must be located near the enhancing surface
to gain any SERS signal, and that signal decays rapidly. This problem
is inconsequential when dropping a solution onto a metallic nanostructure
and allowing it to evaporate. In this case, the molecules are adsorbed
to the surface, but in solution, the analyte has the ability to diffuse
away from the surface.22 Adding flow to
the system limits the time the analyte is near the metallic nanostructure,
further limiting detection and typically requiring micromolar or larger
concentrations.23

The challenge with
SERS detection in flow is improving the interaction
between the metallic nanostructure and the analyte. One approach is
to mix the sample with nanocolloids,15−18,24−27 but this has drawbacks associated with spectral reproducibility
and sophisticated mixing schemes.28 Planar
substrates can avoid these problems,29 but
the limit of detection is controlled by transport of the analyte to
the surface. Recently, a simple and effective approach for SERS detection
in solution was demonstrated for a capillary-based system using hydrodynamic
focusing to promote analyte–substrate interactions.30 The analyte slowly exiting a capillary is confined
within a region above the SERS surface by a faster moving sheath fluid
in a macroscopic flow channel. This region is defined by the flow
rate ratio between sheath flow and sample streams. The technique is
commonly used in flow cytometry,31 capillary
electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence,32,33 and other detection methods. This strategy has been successfully
used for online SERS detection with capillary zone electrophoresis
(CZE) to separate the structural isomers of rhodamine34 and the detection of the 20 proteinogenic l-amino
acids35 and peptides.36

The increased control of fluid dynamics and sampling
volumes intrinsic
to microfluidic devices suggests a route to further improvements.
A unique method to fabricate microchip devices with integrated electrodes
was shown using both epoxy and polystyrene to encapsulate the electrode.
These devices integrate multiple components into a simple microfluidic
platform including microchip electrophoresis with electrochemical
detection and the investigation of cellular processes using both optical
and electrochemical methods.37−40 The detection limits are improved with the deposition
of metals onto the embedded electrodes to create pillars, increasing
the surface area of the electrodes.37 This
approach, incorporating both encapsulated microelectrodes and fluidic
tubing,41 was shown to have superior analytical
performance when compared to other fluidic connections with considerable
dead volume.

Incorporating hydrodynamic focusing into a microfluidic
platform
with embedded fluidic tubing and a SERS active electrode suggests
a new route to ultrasensitive detection. The combination of SERS and
electrochemical experiments allows a unique advantage of combining
multiple detection methods to obtain complementary information about
analytes. In this study, the combination of finite element analysis,
amperometry, and Raman experiments is used to demonstrate improved
electrochemical and SERS detection of the redox-active metabolite
riboflavin. The results show the SERS activity of the deposited electrodes
and the ability to detect riboflavin at low concentrations during
amperometric experiments by confining it onto the SERS-active electrode
using hydrodynamic focusing.

Experimental Section
Materials and Reagents
Device and Electrode Fabrication
The fabrication of
the polystyrene-encapsulated electrodes was performed as previously
reported37 with the addition of embedded
fluidic tubing.41 Figure 1 illustrates the resulting device. Using colloidal silver,
a 25 μm gold wire electrode was connected to an extending wire
and shrink tubing was fastened around the two for security. Alignment
holes for the tubing and electrodes were punched into an aluminum
weighing dish with a syringe needle. To ensure the gold electrode
was against the outside wall of the fused silica capillary tubing,
the gold wire was wrapped around the capillary and both were threaded
through the hole. By adjoining the electrode and tubing, this allowed
for the electrode to be approximately 100–200 μm away
from the i.d. of the capillary. To prevent polystyrene powder from
clogging the capillary while heating, a PDMS plug was used to seal
the capillary opening on the backside of the weighing dish. Polystyrene
powder was then poured into the dish, which was heated to 250 °C
until the powder was completely melted. The device was left to cool
until reaching room temperature before removing from the hot plate
and weighing dish. The encapsulated gold (Au) electrode was made SERS-active
by electrodepositing silver (Ag) onto the surface. A PDMS reservoir
was positioned around the electrode, and the Ag plating solution was
placed inside. A potential of −1.2 V vs Ag/AgCl was applied
for 200 s to form the roughened surface. In situ Raman
measurements were performed using a 250 μm wide by 100 μm
high channel molded in a thin film of PDMS. A 20:1 mixture of the
elastomer base was poured onto a silicon master and heated at 75 °C
for 1 h. The PDMS chip was cut to form a reservoir for solution collection
and positioned over the SERS-active electrode in line with the capillary
and SERS-active electrode (Figure 1c).

and 25 μm SERS-active electrode. The addition of a 250 μm
PDMS channel over the top allows for solution flow and in
situ experiments. (b) Shows the actual chip while (c) is
a brightfield image showing the capillary and electrode in the microchannel.

Raman Measurements
Raman spectroscopy was performed
using a previously described home-built system42 along with a commercial Raman microscope (InVia, Renishaw,
Inc.). Laser excitation for both was provided by a 632.8 nm HeNe laser.
Flow experiments were completed using the home-built system. The sample
was illuminated through a 40× water immersion objective (Olympus,
NA = 0.8), and the power measured at the sample was 1 mW. Raman scattering
was collected through the same objective and transmitted back to the
spectrograph and EMCCD (Newton 970, Andor). Spectra were recorded
in kinetic series with varying acquisition times. Maps of the SERS
electrodes were done with the commercial Raman microscope. A 20×
objective (Leica, NA = 0.4) was used to illuminate the sample, and
the laser power measured at the sample was ∼0.8 mW. A spectrum
was recorded at each point of the map with a 1 s acquisition time.

Electrochemical Measurements
Electrochemical measurements
were made using a CH Instruments Model 660D Potentiostat. The embedded
electrode functions as the working electrode with a platinum wire
auxiliary electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Both electrodes
are placed at the end of the microchannel, in a reservoir. All potentials
in this manuscript are referenced versus Ag/AgCl and 0.1 M NaOH is
the supporting electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry and riboflavin (diffusion
coefficient of 4.0 × 10–6 cm2/s43) were used to determine the surface area of
both the bare Au microelectrode and the surface after the deposition
of Ag. The scan rate was 0.1 V/s and the potential was swept from
−0.3 to −1.0 V. The concentration of riboflavin (in
a 0.1 M NaOH supporting electrolyte) was 5 mM.

Electrode Roughening
The Raman signal of the deposited
Ag SERS electrode was improved by running an oxidation–reduction
cycle (ORC), with flow, to electrochemically roughen the surface and
remove any contaminants. The roughening was done in 0.1 M NaOH at
a flow rate of 10 μL/min. To perform the ORC, the potential
was swept from −0.5 to 0.6 V at 5 mV/s for 3 scans. The PDMS
microchannel was removed and the electrode was rinsed with nanopure
water.

Flow Assembly
Figure S-1 in the Supporting Information shows a schematic diagram of the experimental
setup for the flow experiments. The PDMS microchannel is positioned
over both the encapsulated capillary and electrode so that the analyte
of interest can be delivered into the detection regime on the electrode.
Solution is driven via a syringe pump (Model NE-1000, New Era Pump
Systems Inc., Farmingdale, NY) through both the inlet-hole in the
PDMS channel and the capillary. Hydrodynamic focusing of the capillary
solution is achieved by pumping the sheath flow continuously through
the inlet. The sample is injected through a Valco 4-port injector
with an internal 100 nL sample loop (Vici) and enters the channel
through the capillary. The liquid collects at the end of the flow
channel in a reservoir cut out of the PDMS where the counter and reference
electrodes are positioned to allow for electrochemical detection.
When placed under the home-built microscope system, simultaneous spectro-electrochemical
experiments can be completed.

COMSOL Simulations
Commercial finite element analysis
software, Comsol Multiphysics 4.4a (COMSOL Inc., Burlington, MA),
was used to model the fluid dynamics inside the microchannel. A 3-D
model of the flow channel was designed in the CAD setting of the program.
The geometry consisted of a cylindrical tube intersecting with a rectangular
channel with dimensions matching the capillary and microchannel. Laminar
flow was modeled using Navier–Stokes equations at steady state.
The mass transport of the solute molecules inside the capillary and
microchannel was modeled using Fick’s law for steady state
transport. A concentration boundary condition of 1 mM was applied
to the capillary (sample) inlet and 0 mM to the inlet of the microchannel.

Results
SERS Electrode Characterization
The SERS-active electrode
was formed by electrodepositing Ag onto an Au microelectrode embedded
into a polystyrene chip. The surface area of the deposited SERS electrode
was determined using cyclic voltammetry and the Randles-Sevcik equation
as follows:44  Voltammograms
of 5 mM riboflavin were completed,
and the peak current was used to calculate the area before and after
the electrodeposition. The resulting area after a 200 s electrodeposition
of silver is 1.59 × 10–5 cm2, which
is 3 times larger than with the flat microelectrode (5.00 × 10–6 cm2). The height of the electrode is ∼2
μm.

To assess the SERS activity of the deposited electrode,
a self-assembled monolayer of thiophenol was formed on the surface
and a Raman map of the electrode was obtained as shown in Figure 2a–d. Figure 2a shows
the brightfield image with the corresponding mapped section highlighted.
Several characteristic bands associated with thiophenol are seen at
1000, 1022, and 1075 cm–1 in Figure 2d. Figure 2c shows a map of the band
area at 1075 cm–1. The Raman map demonstrates that
the highest signals occur around the edges of the electrode surface.
Furthermore, the strong scattering around the edges of the electrode
can be seen from the darkfield image in Figure 2b.

Figure 2 A SERS-active electrode is formed by electrodepositing silver onto
a gold microelectrode. The left portion shows the (a) brightfield,
(b) darkfield, (c) heatmap of the 1075 cm–1 band
area in thiophenol, and (d) representative spectrum of thiophenol.
The Raman signal was improved by running an oxidation–reduction
cycle with flow to electrochemically roughen the surface. The right
figure demonstrates the results with the (e) brightfield, (f) darkfield,
(g) heatmap, and (h) spectrum. The heatmap illustrates not only an
increase in the overall signal but also a rise with relative signal
uniformity across the surface. The cyclic voltammogram from the ORC
is shown in (i).

Electrochemically pretreating
the surface using an oxidation–reduction
cycle (ORC) with flow was found to dramatically increase the SERS
signal. Figure 2e–h shows the SERS response
from a self-assembled monolayer of thiophenol after cycling. The brightfield
image with the mapped section highlighted is shown in Figure 2e and the darkfield image in Figure 2f. Comparison of the bright and dark field images before and
after electrochemical cycling show subtle differences; however, dramatic
differences are observed in the Raman maps. Figure 2g is a map of the 1075 cm–1 band area in
thiophenol. The heatmap shows how the overall SERS intensity across
the substrate has increased, demonstrating an improved SERS response
is obtained with electrochemical cycling after metal deposition. ORC
in chloride has been traditionally used to roughen silver electrodes;45 the pretreatment here may act to either roughen
or displace adsorbed CN– from the electroplating
process.

Depositing and electrochemically cycling silver produces
a highly
enhancing SERS-active electrode.45−47 The identity of the
underlying wire does not seem to matter, as we have successfully formed
SERS microelectrodes with gold, copper, silver, and other embedded
wires. Multiple electrode materials can be embedded into the polystyrene,38 and either silver or gold can be deposited to
observe SERS. The substrate can also be regenerated easily by polishing
down the surface and electrodepositing new nanostructures.

Modeling
of Hydrodynamic Focusing in the Microfluidic Device
To determine
the confinement effects from sheath flow in this experimental
setup, we modeled our configuration using COMSOL simulations. These
simulations model the interaction between a sheath flow and a sample
eluting from the capillary embedded in the polystyrene base. The ratio
of the sheath liquid to the sample liquid was varied to see how the
sample flow is confined. The geometry consisted of a cylindrical tube
intersecting with a rectangular channel. The dimensions of both matched
that of the capillary (150 μm i.d.) and microchannel (250 μm
wide by 100 μm high).

Figure 3 presents
the results of the COMSOL simulations from a view normal to the surface
in the xz-plane (left) and a top-view in the xy-plane (right). The first image in each row diagrams the
position of the electrode relevant to the sample eluting from the
capillary under the influence of the sheath flow. The SERS microelectrode
position is limited by the outer diameter of the embedded capillary.
The experiment was modeled with a constant sample flow rate of 1 μL/min,
while increasing the sheath flow to sample flow rate ratio from 1:1
to 2:1, 5:1, 10:1, 20:1, and 30:1, respectively. Figure S-2, Supporting Information, shows wide-field fluorescence
images from the top-view of the capillary with Rhodamine-6G eluting
at different flow ratios, which help substantiate the xy-plane of the simulations.

Figure 3 xz (left) and xy (right) view
of the fluid dynamics inside the flow channel modeled using COMSOL.
A schematic representation of the simulations with the location of
the capillary and microelectrode is on top of each view, followed
by varying sheath to capillary flow ratios. The concentration intensity
scales from zero (blue) to 1 mM (red) in these simulations.

The confinement of the analyte
relative to the position of the
SERS electrode changes as the sheath flow rate increases. Using a
1:1 sheath to capillary flow ratio, the simulation predicts little
confinement of the analyte at the SERS electrode. The most concentrated
portion of the stream does not interact near the area where the electrode
is positioned. The optimum sample confinement occurs at a sheath flow
to sample flow ratio of 5:1. At this flow rate ratio, there is sufficient
confinement to maximize the sample concentration to 200 μm after
the capillary, which is well within where the SERS-active electrode
is positioned. When the flow ratio is 10:1 or greater, the COMSOL
simulations seem to show a rapid mixing of the two flows, leading
to much quicker dilution of the eluting analyte.

Depending on
the ratio between the sheath and capillary flow rates,
the concentration of the analyte decays rapidly from the capillary
inlet. Figure S-3, Supporting Information, shows how this signal decays at the different flow ratios, on the
basis of the distance from the capillary. The highlighted region is
the approximate distance that the electrode can be placed. In that
region, at a 5:1 flow ratio, the concentration is ∼0.987 mM,
still near the 1 mM initial concentration modeled in the simulation.
This indicates that the SERS electrode is close enough to benefit
from the focusing effect. The average concentration at each flow ratio
within the electrode region is shown in Figure 4a, plotted versus the sheath to capillary flow rate, showing the
sample concentration at the SERS electrode is optimized at the 5:1
flow ratio.

Figure 4 A comparison of the (a) COMSOL simulation, (b) amperometry, and
(c) SERS detection results with varying sheath to capillary flow rates
demonstrating the focusing effect. (a) Shows a plot of the average
concentration within the electrode regime at each flow ratio from
the simulations. (b) Shown here is a plot of the band area of two
characteristic frequencies of 1.0 μm riboflavin, 1255 and 1330
cm–1, versus the flow ratio. (c) A plot of the area
of the amperometric peak obtained from 100 nL injections of 100 μM
riboflavin at varying flow ratio is shown. All three plots demonstrate
that the optimal sample confinement comes from a flow ratio of between
2:1 and 5:1.

The model indicates that
using a sample capillary embedded within
the bottom of a larger microfluidic channel can produce flow focusing
in three dimensions. The position of the electrode with respect to
the outer diameter of the sample capillary limits the obtainable focusing;
however, the simulation predicts 98.7% of the eluted sample concentration
is maintained at the optimum flow rate ratio.

On-Chip Sheath-Flow SERS
and Amperometric Detection
Raman measurements were obtained
at varying sheath flow rates to
determine the effect on the observed SERS signal. 1.0 μM riboflavin
was eluted from the capillary with varying sheath to capillary flow
rates and the signal measured. Figure 4b shows
the absolute band areas at 1255 and 1330 cm–1 from
the SERS spectrum of riboflavin, plotted as a function of sheath flow
rate. The bands used are associated with the ring III stretching modes
coupled with a N–H bending mode and ring II modes of riboflavin,
respectively.48,49

The trend demonstrates
that the highest SERS intensity is observed at a sheath flow to sample
flow rate ratio near 5:1. This agrees with the COMSOL simulation results
in Figure 3a. As the sheath flow is increased
further, there is a noticeable drop in the SERS intensity that is
nonlinear. The drop matches the COMSOL simulations.

The focusing
effect on electrochemical detection was also studied.
The reduction of riboflavin in the sample was monitored by amperometry.
Amperometric detection was performed with 100 nL injections of 100
μm riboflavin injected into the microchannel at varying sheath
to capillary flow rates while the electrode was held at a constant
potential of −1.2 V. The faradaic current is related to the
charge transferred across the electrified interface as a result of
the reaction and can be expressed by the equation as follows:44  where Q is coulombs (or Amperes/second), n is the number of electrons transferred, F is Faraday’s constant, and N is the number
of moles. Increased current corresponds to improved transport and
more analyte molecules reacting at the electrode surface.50−53

The charge passed at the electrode was determined by integrating
the peak area in each amperogram and plotted versus the flow ratio,
as shown in Figure 4c. The plot shows an increase
from the 1:1 to the 2:1 ratio. After, there is a steady, nonlinear
decrease in the peak area. The results observed indicate that the
highest currents are seen between the 2:1 and 5:1 sheath to capillary
flow rates. The trend is consistent with the COMSOL simulations. However,
when compared to the SERS intensity plot, while the trend is similar,
the signal decreases more rapidly in the electrochemical experiment.
This may represent differences in electrochemical vs spectroscopic
detection associated with analyte absorption.

SERS and Electrochemical
Sensitivity and Limit of Detection
The results from the COMSOL
simulations, SERS, and amperometry
indicate that a 5:1 sheath to capillary flow ratio is optimal for
obtaining the highest signals. Using this ideal flow, the SERS and
electrochemical limit of detections were examined.

Amperometric
experiments were done at −1.2 V, appropriate for riboflavin
reduction. 100 nL injections of riboflavin at varying concentrations
were completed at a 5:1 sheath to capillary flow ratio. Figure 5 shows a plot of the peak height versus concentration
ranging from 1 mM to 100 nM. Using this platform, the limit of detection
(3 × slope/noise) is 89 nM. As expected, the plot shows a linear
increase in current with increasing concentration. The slope of the
line is 13 nA/mM. This suggests a concentration per electrode area
of 1.1 nA/μm radius/mM. For riboflavin (D0 = 4.0 × 10–6 cm2/s43), the steady state current at a disk can be
expressed by the equation as follows:44  The maximum current is 1.5 nA/μm
radius/mM.
This value suggests we are not at steady state and that higher analyte
flux to the electrode could further improve detection.

Figure 5 100 nL injections of
varying concentrations of riboflavin were
examined with a 5:1 sheath to capillary flow rate while applying −1.2
V. Shown is a plot of the peak height versus the concentration. The
limit of detection is 100 nM with the focusing effect.

The electrodeposition of silver not only provides
a SERS substrate
but also increases the surface area by a factor of 3, after a 200
s deposition. This will lead to an increase in current and a lower
limit of detection when compared to the flat electrode. The question
becomes is the increased electrochemical signal seen a result of a
larger surface area alone or also due to the hydrodynamic focusing
effect employed. Without embedded tubing or the use of focusing, an
examination of catechol resulted in a limit of detection of 600 nM
with the flat microelectrode.37 The observation
of 100 nM riboflavin here is 6 times lower than that. Experiments
suggest surface area accounts for a 3× increase in signal. The
additional increase of 2× is consistent with our COMSOL prediction,
indicating that focusing the analyte onto the electrode also improves
the amperometric limit of detection.

Under the same optimized
conditions, SERS experiments were done
to access the limit of detection. This study was done concurrently
with the amperometry. Figure 6a shows the SERS
spectrum at varying riboflavin concentrations with 250 ms acquisition
times while applying −1.2 V. The heatmaps in Figure 6b–d show the observed SERS intensity at each
Raman shift as a function of time for each 100 nL injection of riboflavin
at each corresponding concentration. Figure S-6, Supporting Information, shows a zoom and closer inspection
shows the rapid absorption and desorption observed in the SERS signals
with time. Consecutive injections showed the same magnitude of SERS
intensity, demonstrating the stability of the SERS electrode.

sheath to capillary flow rate. −1.2 V is applied. The heatmap
showing the SERS intensity as a function of time for the (b) 100 nM,
(c) 10 nM, and (d) 1 nM injection of riboflavin.

Using an electrode array embedded in PS devices, concentrations
down to 4 nM have been successfully detected electrochemically,54 indicating that a lower limit of detection is
possible, albeit it with more electrochemically active species than
riboflavin (such as catechol and nitric oxide). The SERS spectra at
each concentration show variation in peak intensity commonly associated
with SERS; however, the observed peak frequencies are assigned to
the flavin moiety (Table S-1, Supporting Information).

Discussion
A common approach to hydrodynamic focusing
in microfluidic devices
utilizes focusing streams that are on the same plane as other channels
in the device.55,56 A unique feature of this PS-based
encapsulation approach is that both the electrodes and tubing can
be aligned within close proximity and in a manner where they are perpendicular
to the resulting chip surface. This results in a 3-dimensional focusing
effect, where the incoming flow stream (from an off-chip injector)
is focused onto the pillar detection electrode. While there have been
other fabrication intensive approaches for 3-dimensional focusing,57 this approach is relatively straightforward
and easy to fabricate. For the devices described in this work, the
resulting encapsulated base, once developed, can be used for long
periods of time, with a PDMS channel being used to seal over the tubing/electrode
surface and a fresh electrode surface being made as desired with a
polishing step.

The microfluidic device used here for flow analysis
has several
advantages over the initial sheath-flow SERS detector developed30 and other microchip-based analytical methods
that use off-chip injection methods to introduce the analyte. Microfluidic
channels provide improved control of flow conditions over the larger
flow channel used previously. Additionally, the SERS microelectrode
embedded into the polystyrene allows for simultaneous electrochemical
and Raman measurements. By positioning embedded tubing within 200
μm of the microelectrode and using a fast moving sheath flow,
hydrodynamic focusing can be used to confine the analyte eluting from
the capillary over a short distance. The embedded tubing also allows
for low dead volume analysis and has been shown to improve the reproducibility
and analytical performance when compared to other off-chip methods.41

The inherent drawback to this is that
if the SERS electrode is
not close enough to the embedded capillary, then no advantages are
seen. The flux to the electrode is limited by this geometric constraint.
It is important to align the PDMS microchannel over the capillary
and electrode. The stream of analyte is focused over a region governed
by the ratio between the sheath and capillary flow rates (Figure 3). If the electrode is not centered in the flow
channel, then the analyte stream will not be focused onto the electrode
where the sensing is done. We have been able to reproducibly get the
electrode within 200 μm of the embedded capillary, illustrating
the feasibility of this, as well as lining up the capillary and electrode
within the channel. Differences in flow sensitivity from experiment
to experiment are due to challenges in alignment of the flow channel
with the electrode. It is worth noting that
by embedding/fixing the sample inlet capillary and detection electrode
in polystyrene, realigning the flow channel is straightforward.

A unique advantage to this microfluidic device is the ability to
couple SERS with electrochemical quantification. The embedded microelectrode
allows for the ability to examine redox active species and gain quantitative
information. Electrodeposition of Ag is done to make a roughened surface
capable of giving rise to SERS to obtain chemical specific information
about the electron transfer events. In SERS, a hotspot can dominate
and good quantitative information is difficult to gain at higher concentrations,
but since the charge is directly related to the number of molecules
using electrochemical techniques, we can obtain that quantitative
information.

A challenge for this device is surface heterogeneity.
The substrate
after electrodeposition is not very uniform, leading to lower enhancements
across the surface when compared to other SERS substrates. This can
be improved by electrochemically roughening the surface; however,
there are still some spots on the surface that do not give rise to
much enhancement. Finding the “hotspot” enables detection
of concentrations down to 1 nM with SERS; however, this is accompanied
by some fluctuations in peak intensity. Other approaches to preparing
SERS electrodes may help address this challenge going forward.58

As seen in Figure 6, the signal-to-noise
ratio observed in the SERS measurements is very high, even at nanomolar
concentrations. This could be a result of several factors. The confinement
of the analyte near the SERS electrode by the sheath flow should increase
the interaction between the two, leading to higher signals. Another
contributor is the time the analyte is interacting with the SERS substrate.
The slower moving the sheath fluid, the more time the analyte will
be near the substrate. The confinement is related to the overall channel
dimensions, such that slower flow rates are sufficient in the microchannel
geometry.

Along with the high signal-to-noise ratio, Figure 6 also shows the enhancement of different vibrational
bands
of riboflavin relative to one another at each concentration. The SERS
spectrum of riboflavin is concentration and potential dependent, as
well as mode specific.59−63 While the slight shift in some peak positions (Table S-1, Supporting Information) could be explained by
concentration-dependent changes,59 the
significant change in certain bands being enhanced over others does
not appear to be attributed to that. This could result from how the
molecule is orientated on the surface during the flow injection experiments.
The orientation of the molecule can be affected by the potential applied
to the SERS electrode,60−63 and different orientations would result in certain bands being enhanced
over others. The surface heterogeneity likely results in a variety
of plasmonic environments, which have been shown to alter the observed
SERS spectrum.64

Conclusions
A
unique microfluidic approach using hydrodynamic focusing and
combining SERS with amperometry for high throughput detection has
been demonstrated. The microfluidic device maintains the advantages
of sheath-flow SERS detection in a compact design. These advantages
include fast detection, high throughput, better signal-to-noise, lower
limits of detection, and nonfouling of the analyte to the SERS electrode.
This means that appreciable signal can be observed with small sample
volumes. The addition of a PDMS microchannel over a polystyrene embedded
capillary and microelectrode provides a smaller total volume, a reduced
dead volume, and a controlled fluidic environment to confine the analyte
eluting from the capillary onto the microelectrode for simultaneous
SERS and amperometric detection. SERS detection of riboflavin was
demonstrated at a concentration of 1 nM, while the electrochemical
detection limit is 89 nM. This device suggests a straightforward route
to improving trace detection both spectroscopically and electrochemically.
