Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection (CDI) rates have exhibited
a steady rise worldwide over
the last two decades and the infection poses a global threat due to
the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains. Interstrain antagonistic
interactions across the host microbiome form an important strategy
for controlling the emergence of CDI. The current diagnosis method
for CDI, based on immunoassays for toxins produced by pathogenic C. difficile strains, is limited by false negatives due
to rapid toxin degradation. Furthermore, simultaneous monitoring of
nontoxigenic C. difficile strains is not possible,
due to absence of these toxins, thereby limiting its application toward
the control of CDI through optimizing antagonistic interstrain interactions.
Herein, we demonstrate that morphological differences within the cell
wall of particular C. difficile strains with differing
S-layer proteins can induce systematic variations in their electrophysiology,
due alterations in cell wall capacitance. As a result, dielectrophoretic
frequency analysis can enable the independent fingerprinting and label-free
separation of intact microbials of each strain type from mixed C. difficile samples. The sensitivity of this contact-less
electrophysiological method is benchmarked against the immunoassay
and microbial growth rate methods for detecting alterations within
both, toxigenic and nontoxigenic C. difficile strains
after vancomycin treatment. This microfluidic diagnostic platform
can assist in the development of therapies for arresting clostridial
infections by enabling the isolation of individual strains, optimization
of antibiotic treatments and the monitoring of microbiomes.

==== Body
A toxin-mediated
intestinal
disease, Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), is
commonly attributed to exposure to pathogenic C. difficile strains, following the elimination of healthy microflora in the
gut, due to administration of antibiotics.1 Prior studies within animal models strongly suggest that asymptomatic
colonization with nontoxigenic Clostridium difficile (NTCD) strains can reduce the incidence of CDI from toxigenic Clostridium difficile (TCD) strains.2−5 The development of such preventive
therapies against CDI requires means to monitor NTCD colonization
during antibiotic and other therapeutic interventions, so that the
antagonistic interactions between differing strains during coinfection
can be characterized and optimized. However, there is no independent
method to simultaneously monitor physiological alterations in both
NTCD and TCD strains, especially during antibiotic and therapeutic
interventions. The gold standard of CDI diagnosis is a culture of
the bacteria from stool samples and testing for toxin production levels
(cytotoxicity assay).6 Given the time-consuming
nature of toxigenic C. difficile culture, rapid diagnosis
of CDI is usually accomplished by enzyme immunoassays (EIA) that can
directly monitor TCD strains through detecting the glutamate dehydrogenase
(GDH) levels as well as that of toxin A (TcdA) and/or toxin B (TcdB)
levels. However, this method is hampered by poor sensitivity due to
rapid degradation of the toxins,6 thereby
requiring its combined application with polymerase chain reduction
(PCR) to reduce false-positives and false-negatives.6,7 Furthermore, colonization by NTCD strains cannot be monitored by
EIAs due to absence of the toxins or by PCR-restriction fragment analysis
of the pathogenicity locus (PaLoc)1,8 due to absence
of the PaLoc within NTCD strains. Hence, there is a need for methods
to enable the simultaneous monitoring of levels and physiological
alterations of each strain-type within mixed C. difficile samples, preferably in a label-free, nondestructive, and real-time
manner.

S(Surface)-layer glyco-proteins are part of the cell
wall envelope
in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. They are integral toward
surface recognition, colonization, host–pathogen adhesion,
and virulence.9,10 A number of studies have shown
that the antigenic variations of S-layers between C. difficile strains11−13 can serve as a potential alternative to serotyping
by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and nucleotide
sequencing,14 but these methods have not
been applied toward the recovery of intact microbials of each strain.
S-layer deficient mutant strains can exhibit morphological differences,
such as lower surface roughness versus the wild type strain, within
various microbial samples.15 Hence, the
correlation of S-layer induced morphological or functional variations
to the cell electrophysiology can enable interstrain distinctions
for the separation of intact C. difficile. Similar
distinctions may also be possible within other Gram-positive and Gram-negative
microbials that exhibit interstrain S-layer variations. For instance, Campylobacter fetus exhibits antigenically distinct S-layers
due to DNA inversion and recombination of surface array A gene (sapA),16 while Geobacillus
stearothermophilus has various S-layer gene expressions depending
on the oxygen level,16,17 and strains of C. fetus(18) and Lactobacillus helveticus(19) have been identified based on the S-layer
gene after PCR amplification.

Dielectrophoresis (DEP) causes
the frequency-selective translation
of polarized bioparticles in a spatially nonuniform electric field,
either toward (by positive DEP or pDEP) or away (by negative DEP or
nDEP) from the high field regions of a microfluidic device, depending
on the polarizability of the bioparticle versus that of the medium.20,21 Hence, in spite of the heterogeneous nature of microbial samples,
the frequency response of the DEP velocity of individual cells toward
or away from localized regions of a microfluidic device can be used
to quantify the alterations in electrophysiology of each cell type,
while the frequency-selective DEP collection rate at these localized
regions can be used to quantify the relative levels of each cell type.22,23 Prior work on DEP analysis and separation of live versus dead Gram-positive
or Gram-negative bacteria24,25 has been accomplished
using either ac fields (10 kHz–10 MHz) on electrode-based devices26,27 or using purely dc fields on electrode-less devices with insulating
constrictions.24 While ac fields enable
subtle distinction of cells based on their membrane or wall capacitance28 and cytoplasm electrophysiology, the high field
at electrode edges can cause irreversible adhesion or damage of cells.
Electrodeless techniques, on the other hand, enable contactless DEP
manipulation at higher throughputs (due to field nonuniformities across
the entire device depth), and they are especially significant within
applications where functional microbials need to be collected for
subsequent analysis. However, their application under dc field limits
the distinctions to those based solely on cell wall permeability,
rather than including distinctions based on capacitance and permittivity
effects. In spite of this, recent work has demonstrated their ability
toward distinguishing serotypes of Escherichia coli(29) and discriminating wild type versus
surface protein isogenic mutant bacteria strains.30 Recently, we have developed instrumentation for electrodeless
DEP over a wide frequency bandwidth31 and
applied it toward discerning persistent versus susceptible subpopulations
of Cryptosporidium parvum through sensitive and label-free
measurement of the DEP trapping force on single microbial cells.32 In this current work, we apply these capabilities
toward the label-free distinction of intact C. difficile strains with systematic differences in cell wall morphology that
occur due to their constituting S-layer, as correlated by an adhesion
assay. Differences in cell wall roughness are shown to cause systematic
differences in their DEP crossover frequency due to alterations in
the net wall capacitance. Furthermore, systematic differences correlated
to their cytoplasm polarizability are apparent within the high frequency
dispersion spectra (1–4 MHz) of each C. difficile strain, especially after vancomycin treatment. The sensitivity of
the DEP method toward monitoring alterations after vancomycin treatment
is benchmarked against the toxin immunoassay and microbial growth
rate methods for toxigenic and nontoxigenic C. difficile strains, respectively. On the basis of this, we envision future
work on applying DEP techniques toward clinical isolates for eventual
application toward the independent monitoring and separation of particular C. difficile strains from mixed C. difficile samples, in a nondestructive and label-free manner.

Experimental
Methods
C. difficile Sample Preparation
All
experiments were conducted in a biosafety level 2 (BSL2) certified
laboratory. The C. difficile samples (purchased from
ATCC) were transferred into the microfluidic chip within the biosafety
cabinet and sealed with platinum electrodes to prevent leakage. The
dielectrophoretic motion of the respective C. difficile cells under the external field can then be observed under the microscope,
outside of the biosafety cabinet, since the well-sealed device obviates
exposure. Following imaging, the chip was disposed as per standard
BSL2 procedures. In some cases, the trapped cells were collected for
measurements of cell viability and the supernatant was collected to
identify toxigenic versus nontoxigenic strains using the toxin immunoassay.
The C. difficile strains were cultured in brain heart
infusion (BHI) broth (BD BBL Brain Heart Infusion) at 37 °C overnight
under anaerobic conditions, before further antibiotic treatment or
dielectrophoresis experiments. The overnight cultured bacteria suspension
(250 μL) and 750 μL of the BHI with vancomycin (Novaplus)
or without vancomycin (for the control groups) were mixed in Eppendorf
tubes and incubated at 37 °C for 4 or 24 h. The vancomycin concentration
for VPI10463 (high-toxigenic, HTCD) was 2 and 1 mg/mL for ATCC630
(low-toxigenic, LTCD) and VPI11186 (nontoxigenic, NTCD). Prior to
the dielectrophoresis experiments, the BHI broth was replaced with
8.8% sucrose water and readjusted with BHI broth to optimize the medium
conductivity at 105 ± 5% mS/m for enabling DEP-based distinction
of C. difficile strains from mixed samples. All three
strains were confirmed to be viable within this altered BHI media
over the time frame of the DEP experiments, as per the colony forming
unit (CFU) assay (see the Supporting Information).

Adhesion Assay
On the basis of prior work,33,34 the human colon epithelial cell line, HCT-8 (purchased from ATCC),
was used as the host cell in this assay. The HCT-8 cells were cultured
in RPMI medium supplied with 10% horse serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate,
100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin at 37 °C
in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were grown as a confluent
monolayer in 6-well plates prior to the assay. PBS and RPMI-serum
free medium were prereduced for oxygen removal by overnight incubation
in the anaerobic chamber. Before the adhesion assay, the cells were
washed twice with PBS and replaced to RPMI-serum free medium. Overnight C. difficile cultures were pelleted and resuspended in fresh
BHI medium to avoid any interference from proteins or toxins. All
three C. difficile strains were adjusted to equal
concentration by optical density measurement. An equal concentration
of each C. difficile strain was added to each well,
and the plates were incubated in the anaerobic chamber at 37 °C
for 3 h. After 3 h, nonadhered C. difficile cells
were eliminated by three wash steps with PBS. Following this, 1 mL
of PBS was added to each well, and the cells were scraped, vortexed,
serially diluted and plated to enumerate adherent C. difficile colony-forming units (CFU). Each experiment was performed in triplicate
and repeated at least three times in entirety. All standard deviations
(SD) in this study were obtained by using 1  

Growth
Measurement
Overnight cultured C. difficile suspension (250 μL) and 750 μL of the BHI broth with
or without vancomycin were mixed in Eppendorf tubes. The optical density
at a wavelength of 600 nm (OD600) of the mixed bacteria suspensions,
as measured by spectrophotometry (Eppendorf Biophotometer) before
incubation, was indexed as the “0 h” time point. The
OD600 number at later incubation time points (4 and 24 h) for the
respective strain at each condition was normalized to its 0 h point.
Each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated at least
three times in entirety.

Toxicity Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
Total toxin
(A/B) production was measured using the C. difficile TOX A/B II kit (Tech-Lab) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Culture supernatants were collected at 0, 4, and 24
h by centrifugation at 3500 rcf for 5 min and stored at −20
°C. The supernatants of the VPI10463 strain were diluted 1 to
20, while the supernatants of the VPI11186 strain were undiluted.
Each specimen was run in duplicate. Total toxin levels were determined
by measuring A450 under a 96 well plate spectrophotometer. The A450
number at each time point (4 and 24 h) for each strain at each condition
was normalized to its 0 h time point. Each experiment was performed
in triplicate and repeated at least three times in entirety.

Sample
Preparation for Transmission Electron Microscope Imaging
C. difficile samples cultured overnight (1 mL)
were pelleted and fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde
in PBS for 4 h at room temperature. The samples were pelleted and
washed 3 times in DI water before resuspension in 2% osmium tetroxide.
After 30 min, the samples were pelleted and washed 2 times in DI water
before the dehydration process. The samples were dehydrated through
a serial gradient ethanol solution (50%, 70%, 95%, and 100%) for 10
min for each sample. The samples then resuspended in 1:1 EtOH/EPON
(epoxy resin) overnight, followed by 1:2 EtOH/EPON for 2 h and 1:4
EtOH/EPON for 4 h and 100% EPON for overnight. After embedding the
samples in fresh 100% EPON, the samples were baked in a 65 °C
oven. The EPON hardened samples were sectioned to 75 nm, mounted onto
200 mesh copper grids, and contrast stained with 0.25% lead citrate
and 2% uranyl acetate for TEM imaging (JEOL 1230) at 80 kV (SIA digital
camera).

Dielectrophoretic Characterization of C. difficile
The experimental setup has been described in our prior
work.32,35 Briefly, standard PDMS (polydimethyl-siloxane)
micromolding methods were used to microfabricate channels with sharp
lateral constrictions (1000–15 μm). This so-called “electrodeless
DEP device” was bonded using oxygen plasma treatment to a standard
coverslip for easy microscopic viewing of DEP behavior. Using Pt electrodes
at the inlet and outlet, ac fields were applied over a wide-frequency
range (50 kHz to 5 MHz) by utilizing a power amplifier for particle
trapping toward or away from high field points at the constriction
tips. The trajectory of the unlabeled C. difficile of each strain type was observed under this field, as high frame
per second movies to quantify the DEP velocity. The data acquisition
was automated to enable the capture of movies at each frequency within
about 10 s, with the entire frequency spectrum completed within about
5 min. The same cells can be measured multiple times under the DEP
field since we use the electrodeless DEP technique under high frequency
ac fields, with applied fields less than 300 Vpp/cm, thereby
obviating electro-permeabilization effects, which we confirmed through
viability analysis on microbials under the DEP field. For experiments
within mixed C. difficile samples, the trapped microbials
were released and the supernatant was analyzed with the immunoassay
to confirm toxigenicity. The DEP analysis was conducted on the microbials
following the log phase stage of their culture period to ensure the
insensitivity of DEP analysis to the temperature of the culture media
and time for the culture. A full description of the simultaneous and
automated dielectrophoretic tracking of single bioparticles can be
found in our previous work.32

Results
and Discussion
Morphological Differences
between C. difficile Strains
We begin with
an examination of the morphological
differences between three particular C. difficile strains: the high-toxigenic VPI10463 strain (HTCD), the low-toxigenic
strain ATCC630 (LTCD), and the nontoxigenic strain VPI11186 (NTCD).
As per the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images at 50k magnification
in Figure 1a,c,e and at 100k magnification
in Figure 1b,d,f, the three C. difficile strains show systematic variations in surface roughness in the cell
wall region (see arrows), with the highest roughness apparent in the
HTCD strain (Figure 1a,b), followed by LTCD
(Figure 1c,d), and finally the NTCD strain
(Figure 1e,f), which exhibits relatively smooth
surface features. One of the chief differences between the respective
strains is the S-layer on their cell wall, which exhibits the SlpA gene and Cwp gene sequence variations.7,11,13 On the basis of prior observations
of a smoother cell surface for the S-layer deficient mutant Tannerella forsythia versus the wild type,15 we seek to correlate the interstrain morphological differences
in C. difficile to their S-layer variations by using
a standard adhesion assay. It has been shown that surface layer proteins
are the chief determinant for the adherence of C. difficile to host cells34 and for binding to gastrointestinal
tissues.36 Figure 1g shows a representative phase contrast image of the adherence of
HTCD to the human colon epithelial host cells after three wash steps.
As per Figure 1h, the HTCD strain shows the
strongest adherence to the host cells, followed by LTCD and finally
NTCD strains. This correlation of high cell wall roughness of the C. difficile strain-type to its enhanced host-cell adherence
suggests an abundance of S-layer proteins within the HTCD strain,
with successively lower S-layer protein levels within the LTCD and
NTCD strains due to their relatively smoother features and poorer
adhesion to the host cells. We also note that the average cell wall
thickness of the HTCD strain (32.1 ± 3.8 nm) is lower than that
of the NTCD strain (38.3 ± 5.2 nm), as averaged over 10 cells,
as per the measurements in the Supporting Information, Figure S1.

Independent Dielectrophoretic
Monitoring of C. difficile Strains
Dielectrophoresis
(DEP) of biological particles,
such as C. difficile, can be characterized using
a shell model.20,21 Herein, the net capacitance (C) due to the dielectric properties of the cell wall and
membrane screens the electric field at low frequencies to cause negative
DEP (nDEP), whereas the low resistance (R) due to
conductive properties of the cytoplasm dominates at high frequencies
to cause positive DEP (pDEP), with the crossover frequency (fxo) from nDEP to pDEP being determined by the
inverse of the RC time constant due to the net resistance
and capacitance of the system. On the basis of a parallel-plate model
for the cell wall with spacing, d, and material permittivity,
ε, its capacitance rises with surface area (A): 2  

Changes in surface roughness and area
of the cell wall would cause systematic differences in the net capacitance
of each C. difficile strain. Hence, on the basis
of the interstrain differences in surface roughness in Figure 1, HTCD strains should have the highest net capacitance,
followed by the LTCD and then by the NTCD strains. The DEP crossover
(fxo) for each C. difficile strain can be related to these differences in net cell wall capacitance
(Cnet) at a given media conductivity (σm) as follows:28 3  

Hence,
we anticipate the lowest fxo for the HTCD
strain, followed by that of the LTCD strain and finally
the NTCD strain. However, in order to observe substantial differences
in fxo between the strains, it is necessary
to optimize the media conductivity (σm) using the
strain-types that exhibit maximum differences in their cell wall roughness.
Below a critical value of σm, the high resistance
of the surrounding media will dominate the net RC time constant of the system, thereby driving the fxo to low values and making it insensitive to differences
in wall capacitance between the three strains. On the other hand,
above a critical σm value, pDEP cannot be effectively
observed (pDEP requires particle conductivity to exceed media conductivity),
thereby posing complications toward determining the fxo, due to lack of a clear crossover. As a result, DEP
measurements need to be carried out within media of relatively high
conductivity to enable the observation of significant differences
in the fxo between the C. difficile strains. This is challenging due to the disruptive effects of electrolysis,
electrothermal flow,37−39 and electropermeabilization of cells within electrode-based
DEP devices at substantial σm. Hence, in this current
work, the influence of these disruptive effects on DEP observations
is reduced by the use of electrodeless microfluidic devices, wherein
heat dissipation is enhanced by using channels of high surface to
volume ratio and wherein cell trapping under DEP does not occur at
the electrode but instead at or away from the tips of insulator constrictions
that are designed to locally enhance electric fields.35,40,41 Figure 2a,b shows the electrodeless device with external electrodes (1 cm
apart) to initiate localized microbial trapping in the constriction
region. This electrodeless device geometry also enables facile and
automated dielectrophoretic tracking due to the well-defined particle
trajectories, either toward (by pDEP) or away (by nDEP) from highly
localized constriction tips (Figure 2c), with
a symmetric field profile across the device depth. In this manner,
as per prior work,32 the translational
velocity under the DEP trapping force is measured for ∼20 individual
microbial cells to quantify the DEP spectra. Upon optimization of
σm at 100 mS/m, well separated DEP spectra for each
strain are apparent, as per Figure 2d. Example
images in vicinity of the constriction region of the device after
30 s of ∼300 Vpp/cm field at the optimal frequency
for nDEP and pDEP behavior are shown in Figure 2e for each strain, with arrows to denote the direction of translation,
and the respective velocity values at each frequency are reported
in Figure 2d. On the basis of this, while nDEP
is highest at 100 kHz for all strains, the magnitude of the nDEP velocity
is significantly lower for the HTCD strain versus the LTCD and NTCD
strains. Furthermore, the crossover from nDEP to pDEP behavior occurs
at successively lower values for the HTCD strain (300 ± 75 kHz)
versus the LTCD (500 kHz) and NTCD (900 ± 75 kHz) strains, which
is consistent with its progressively higher net wall capacitance due
to higher surface area and lower cell wall thickness, as per the TEM
images in Figure 1. It is noteworthy that the
absolute fxo value of the HTCD strain
is significantly lower than the other strains, not only due to its
higher cell wall capacitance but also due to its significantly higher
surface conductance, as judged by the lower magnitude of its nDEP
velocity at low frequencies versus other strains. Also apparent is
the successive reduction in the magnitude of maximum positive DEP
force levels, from highest for HTCD to a lower level for LTCD and
lowest for the NTCD strain. This indicates a gradual reduction in
cytoplasm polarizability for the respective strains, since their sizes
are identical. While the magnitude of highest pDEP occurs at 400 kHz
for the HTCD strain, it occurs at 1 MHz for the LTCD and NTCD strains.
Finally, it is apparent that in spite of the reduction in cytoplasm
polarizability for the NTCD strain versus other strains, a discernible
level of positive DEP can be observed up to ∼2 MHz with the
NTCD strain, up to ∼3 MHz with the LTCD strain, and up to ∼1
MHz with the HTCD strain. These characteristic spectral features in
the 0.05–5 MHz range; i.e., the fxo, the frequency and magnitude of maximum pDEP, and the frequency
bandwidth for pDEP can offer the means to fingerprint each C. difficile strain and separate intact microbials of each
strain-type from mixed C. difficile samples. More
generally, since numerous other Gram-positive and Gram-negative microbials
exhibit S-layer variations, these results with C. difficile suggest the broader applicability of frequency-resolved DEP spectra
toward enabling interstrain distinctions.

Alterations to Each C. difficile Strain upon
Vancomycin Treatment
Alterations to the electrophysiology
of cells upon antibiotic treatment, such as distinguishing the degree
of cell wall permeabilization versus cytoplasm disruption, can be
quantified by analyzing the dielectrophoretic frequency spectra of
treated versus untreated cells.26,32,42 Herein, we utilize DEP to probe relative differences in the mechanism
of microbial disruption for each C. difficile strain
after vancomycin treatment, especially since similar measurements
based on toxin production and growth rate can only indicate the overall
alterations in cell viability, without providing information on the
disruption mechanism. Furthermore, DEP spectra can offer information
on the optimal frequencies for separating vancomycin treated cells
from untreated cells of each C. difficile strain,
thereby enabling a means for quantifying the efficacy of vancomycin
treatment on each strain, especially within heterogeneous C. difficile samples. In general, all the three strains
become less polarizable due to functionality alterations to the cell
after 24 h of vancomycin treatment. However, the HTCD strain requires
almost twice as much vancomycin levels than required for LTCD and
NTCD strains to cause alterations to the DEP spectra. As a result
of vancomycin treatment, while the DEP spectra for the HTCD strain
(Figure 3a) is shifted toward a higher crossover
frequency (300 kHz to 600 kHz), the spectra for the LTCD strain (Figure 3b) and the NTCD strain (Figure 3c) are shifted toward successively lower crossover frequencies
(500 kHz to 300 kHz for LTCD and 900 kHz to 600 kHz for NTCD). To
quantify the relative alterations after vancomycin treatment, we show
the steady reduction in DEP velocity for each strain at 1 MHz (Figure 3d) and the changes in crossover frequencies (Figure 3e). It is likely that vancomycin treatment alters
the permeability of the cell wall and membrane regions, so that the
lowered inverse RC time constant of the system enables
DEP crossover at earlier frequencies, as observed for the NTCD and
LTCD strains. For the HTCD strain, on the other hand, the need for
higher vancomycin levels to cause alterations and the up-shifting
of the DEP crossover frequency after vancomycin treatment suggest
a relatively sturdier cell wall and membrane that is not easily permeabilized,
in comparison to the LTCD and NTCD strains. This is consistent with
the trend of our measurements on minimum inhibitory concentration
(0.5 mg/L for NTCD and LTCD and 1 mg/mL for HTCD), indicating the
need for higher antibiotic levels to deactivate HTCD versus other
strains.43

Figure 3 (a–c) Modification of dielectrophoretic
spectra (velocity

of (a) HTCD, (b) LTCD, and (c) NTCD strains. Note that reported velocities
are averaged over 20 cells, of which an overwhelming majority (95–100%)
exhibits the reported velocities, except for vancomycin treated cells
at frequencies close to the DEP crossover, wherein this value drops
to a 50–65% majority of the analyzed cells. (d) Alteration
in the magnitude of the DEP response at 1 MHz (velocity under DEP)
after vancomycin treatment and (e) change in DEP crossover frequency
after vancomycin treatment offer information on alterations in cell
electrophysiology.

Benchmarking DEP Velocities
to Toxin Production and Growth Rate
In order to evaluate
the sensitivity of DEP methods versus the
current state of the art, we benchmark the DEP velocity data for HTCD
and NTCD C. difficile strains after various levels
of antibiotic treatment versus conventional diagnostic measures for
the loss of C. difficile functionality, such as toxin
production and growth rate values. To compare DEP data across the C. difficile strains, we choose the 1 MHz frequency, since
all untreated strains show an equal level of pDEP, and the respective
vancomycin treated samples continue to show pDEP. For measuring alteration
in toxin production level and growth rate of C. difficile strains after antibiotic treatment, it is necessary to culture the
microbial cells with the antibiotic over a period of 4–24 h
to enable sufficient sensitivity. Hence, these results on the untreated
or antibiotic treated microbials are reported as a proportion of their
respective value versus that after a “0 h culture time”
(indexed as “1”). Furthermore, the results after antibiotic
treatment for a particular period of time are compared against their
respective values on untreated microbials for the same period of culture
time (this control value for each treatment time is indicated as “Un-0”,
“Un-4”, or “Un-24” in Figure 4c–e). On the other hand, since DEP velocity
measurements do not require microbial culture to enhance sensitivity,
the “control” measurement for DEP velocity of untreated C. difficile is invariant with antibiotic treatment time.
Figure 4a shows the steady exponential rise
in toxin production levels with culture time for the untreated HTCD
strain, while the alterations upon vancomycin treatment lead to only
a mild rise (1.05 times) after 4 h of treatment and a small reduction
after 24 h treatment, due to degradation of residual toxin level.
The data also shows that the NTCD strain cannot be quantified by this
method due to absence of toxin production. The growth rate data in
Figure 4b follows a similar trend, with the
untreated samples showing a steady exponential rise over time, whereas
the vancomycin treated HTCD sample shows only a mild rise to 1.51
and 1.61 times after 4 and 24 h, respectively, and the vancomycin
treated NTCD sample shows only a minimal rise to 1.1 and 1.05 times,
after 4 and 24 h, respectively. Next, the DEP velocity data after
various treatment periods (4 and 24 h) is compared to the toxin production
level for the HTCD strain (Figure 4c), the
growth rate data for the HTCD strain (Figure 4d), and the growth rate data for the NTCD strain (Figure 4e) over the same treatment periods (4 and 24 h),
with the respective value for the untreated sample at the same time
period serving as the “control” (Un-0, Un-4, or Un-24).
As per the toxin production levels in Figure 4c, while alterations to the HTCD strain are apparent after 24 h of
vancomycin treatment; i.e., a difference of 7.5 versus the control
(Un-24) as per red solid lines along the X-direction,
the alteration is just barely apparent after 4 h of vancomycin treatment;
i.e., a difference of just 0.55 versus the control (Un-4) as per green
solid lines along the X-direction. On the other hand,
the DEP data shows a significant reduction in velocity, from 30.7
μm/s to 7.6 μm/s (green dashed lines in the Y-direction), right from the first time point of 4 h of vancomycin
treatment, with further reduction to 4 μm/s after 24 h of vancomycin
treatment. Similarly, the growth rate reduction of the HTCD strain
is clear only after 24 h of vancomycin treatment in Figure 4d, with a difference of 2.2 versus the control (Un-24),
as per red solid lines in the X-direction. In comparison
to the minimal growth rate reduction in the HTCD strain after 4 h
of vancomycin treatment, the respective reduction in the DEP velocity
is substantial for the same 4 h treatment time. For the NTCD strain,
while the reduction in growth rate is apparent in Figure 4e after 24 h of vancomycin treatment; i.e., a difference
of 3.3 versus the untreated sample (Un-24) as per red solid lines
in the X-direction, the alteration is not easily
distinguishable after 4 h of vancomycin treatment; i.e., a difference
of 0.74 versus the untreated sample (Un-4), as per green solid lines
in the X-direction. On the other hand, just as with
the HTCD strain, reduction in the DEP velocity is substantial (16
μm/s to ∼7 μm/s) right from the first time point
of 4 h of vancomycin treatment as per green dashed lines in the Y-direction. Hence, since the DEP measurement method eliminates
the need for microbial culture, which is required within conventional
diagnostic methods for enhancing their sensitivity toward viable versus
nonviable C. difficile, the DEP velocity measurement
method enables the quantification of microbial alterations at smaller
antibiotic doses. Furthermore, the uncertainties are lowered with
the DEP method, since comparisons are required against only a single
control (i.e., against the DEP velocity of the untreated sample) rather
than against multiple control samples, as required with toxin immunoassay
and growth rate methods (i.e., against the respective values for untreated C. difficile after microbial culture over time periods equivalent
to each antibiotic treatment time point). As a result, we envision
that DEP methods can be applied more easily toward optimizing antibiotic
dosage and discerning the mechanism of their action.

Figure 4 (a) Relative toxin production
and (b) relative growth rate for
HTCD and NTCD strains before and after vancomycin treatment at 0,
4, and 24 h. The data points after 4 and 24 h of treatment are normalized
to their respective value at the 0 h time point. The differences in
microbial toxin production (part c for HTCD) and growth rate (part
d for HTCD and part e for NTCD) after vancomycin treatment are compared
versus the control (0 h treatment) as arrows in the X-direction, while the alterations in DEP response after each treatment
are shown as arrows in the Y-direction. Note that
the respective control value for the Untreated sample at various time
points is shown as Un-0, Un-4, and Un-24 (controls are invariant over
treatment time for DEP data but not so for toxin production and growth
rate data).

Interstrain Separations
from Mixed C. difficile Samples
The quantitative
DEP response measurements in Figures 2d and 3 suggest that particular C. difficile strains may be separated from each other based
on their characteristic electrophysiology, by identifying an appropriate
frequency with maximum differences in the magnitude and direction
of the DEP force. We choose the approach of accomplishing separations
based on differences in direction of DEP force, since it can demonstrate
the differential spatial localization of each strain-type within a
few seconds. The heterogeneous samples we choose are (i) a minority
HTCD subpopulation within a majority population of NTCD strains with
2-fold higher concentration and (ii) a HTCD sample after incomplete
antibiotic treatment over just 20 min, including a subpopulation of
viable HTCD along with deactivated HTCD. For (i), as per Figure 5a, we choose a frequency of 400 kHz, wherein the
HTCD strain exhibits strong pDEP behavior, while the NTCD strain continues
to exhibit substantial nDEP. It is apparent from Figure 5c, that such a separation can be accomplished in a facile
manner, as confirmed by the DEP response and toxin levels measured
from pDEP trapped C. difficile (see Supplementary
Movie 1 versus Supplementary Movie 2 in the Supporting
Information). Similarly, using a 400 kHz field as indicated
in Figure 5b for the separation of sample (ii),
HTCD samples after vancomycin treatment at early time periods (20
min) show the presence of a C. difficile subpopulation
with some viability (red solid arrows), along with a deactivated majority
population (red dotted arrows) (Figure 5d,
also see Supplementary Movie 3 versus Supplementary Movie 4 in the Supporting Information), compared to vancomycin
treated HTCD samples after 4 h (Supplementary Movie 4 in the Supporting Information), thereby presenting a
methodology to quantify the effectiveness of antibiotic treatments
based on the DEP collection rate.

Figure 5 (a) Dielectrophoretic spectra of HTCD
versus NTCD; (b) DEP spectra
of HTCD after vancomycin treatment; (c) at 400 kHz, HTCD strain shows
pDEP (red arrow) versus NTCD strain shows nDEP (blue arrow); (d) at
400 kHz, after 20 min vancomycin treatment, viable HTCD shows pDEP
(red solid arrow) versus deactivated HTCD shows nDEP (red dotted arrow).
Scale bar: 30 μm.

In summary, we demonstrate that morphological differences
in the
cell wall region of C. difficile strains, presumably
due to differing S-layer glyco-protein levels as validated by their
differing adhesion to a host cell, cause systematic variations in
their crossover frequency for transition from negative to positive
dielectrophoresis (DEP) behavior. As a result, the DEP spectra exhibit
characteristic features that may be applied toward independently monitoring
each C. difficile strain with differing S-layers
as well as toward interstrain separation of intact cells from mixed C. difficile samples. Through benchmarking the DEP data
against conventional measures of C. difficile activity,
such as toxin production and growth rate, we demonstrate its superior
sensitivity toward characterizing microbial alterations upon vancomycin
treatment, thereby enabling the application of DEP methods toward
the optimization of antibiotic treatments. Finally, through appropriate
choice of frequency of the applied field, we demonstrate proof-of-concept
separation of subpopulations of high-toxigenic C. difficile strains from a sample of nontoxigenic C. difficile, based on the direction of their dielectrophoresis behavior. In
this manner, we present a methodology for isolation of individual
strains from mixed C. difficile samples, quantification
of antibiotic treatments, and the engineering of nutrient environments
to control microbiomes. We envision that the highly sensitive features
of DEP analysis, which enable the monitoring of antibiotic-induced C. difficile alterations at earlier times, can aid in development
of antibiotic treatments with lower dosages. The ability of frequency-resolved
DEP to selectively probe particular intracellular regions, such as
the S-layer on the cell wall versus current methods based on overall
microbial viability can aid monitoring needs for controlling infections
through deactivating adhesion and colonization by toxigenic C. difficile. In this manner, DEP monitoring methods can
aid in reducing the broader impacts of antibiotics to the microbiome.
