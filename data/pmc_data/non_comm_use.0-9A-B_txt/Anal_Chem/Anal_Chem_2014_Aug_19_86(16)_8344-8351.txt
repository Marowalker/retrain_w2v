Current
in vitro models of the leukocyte adhesion cascade cannot
be used for real-time studies of the entire leukocyte adhesion cascade,
including rolling, adhesion, and migration in a single assay. In this
study, we have developed and validated a novel bioinspired microfluidic
assay (bMFA) and used it to test the hypothesis that blocking of specific
steps in the adhesion/migration cascade significantly affects other
steps of the cascade. The bMFA consists of an endothelialized microvascular
network in communication with a tissue compartment via a 3 μm
porous barrier. Human neutrophils in bMFA preferentially adhered to
activated human endothelial cells near bifurcations with rolling and
adhesion patterns in close agreement with in vivo observations. Treating
endothelial cells with monoclonal antibodies to E-selectin or ICAM-1
or treating neutrophils with wortmannin reduced rolling, adhesion,
and migration of neutrophils to 60%, 20%, and 18% of their respective
control values. Antibody blocking of specific steps in the adhesion/migration
cascade (e.g., mAb to E-selectin) significantly downregulated other
steps of the cascade (e.g., migration). This novel in vitro assay
provides a realistic human cell based model for basic science studies,
identification of new treatment targets, selection of pathways to
target validation, and rapid screening of candidate agents.

==== Body
Inflammation is a physiological
response of the body to protect tissues from infection (bacteria,
virus, parasitic worms, or other pathogens), injury, or disease (cardiovascular,
immune, etc.). The primary role of the inflammatory response is to
eliminate the causative agent and to repair the surrounding tissue.1 Usually, this starts with the signaling cascade
at the affected areas, followed by the production and release of chemical
agents. The evolving signals then recruit leukocytes to the inflammation
site, activating an acute inflammation process.2 This process involves the initiation of the leukocyte adhesion
cascade mediated by a series of interactions between receptors and
ligands on the endothelium and the leukocytes, respectively. Specifically,
circulating leukocytes tether and roll along the vessel wall by establishing
transient selectin-mediated interactions with endothelial cells. This
initial contact facilitates the binding of leukocyte integrins (beta2
and/or alpha4 integrins) to their counter-receptors on the activated
endothelium, which allows leukocytes to firmly adhere to the endothelium
and resist disruptive hemodynamic shear forces. Ultimately, arrested
leukocytes extravasate to inflamed tissues across endothelial cells
(diapedesis or transendothelial migration) via a multistep process
controlled by concurrent chemoattractant-dependent signals, adhesive
events, and hemodynamic shear forces.3,4

Due to
the significance of the leukocyte–endothelium interactions
in pathogenesis of disease5 and drug delivery,6 among many others, several in vitro models have
been developed to study different aspects of the leukocyte adhesion
cascade. Traditionally, most studies involving the inflammatory process
were performed using in vitro static well plates or animal experiments.
However, in recent years a number of fluidic devices have been used
for studying the functional significance of variables such as adhesion
molecules and shear forces in the leukocyte adhesion cascade. Currently
available fluidic devices, including the Glycotech parallel plate
flow chamber7 and recent entries from Cellix
and Fluxion Biosciences, are used to study leukocyte rolling and adhesion.
However, these devices are typically idealized in that they lack correspondence
with in vivo geometry, including scale/aspect ratios (microvasculature
vs large vessel models) and require large reagent volumes.8 Several investigators have developed microfluidic
devices using either a better representation of cross-sectional areas
in vessels9−11 or computer generated ideal geometries that roughly
approximate microvascular networks.12 However,
these devices do not realistically mimic the in vivo geometrical features
(e.g., successive bifurcations, vascular morphology) and flow conditions
(e.g., converging or diverging flows at bifurcations) and are inadequate
for studying adhesion event differences between healthy and diseased
vasculature. On the other hand, devices such as the Boyden chamber
(or Transwell) have been used for decades to study the leukocyte migration
process. However, these assays require the passage of leukocytes through
membrane pores which do not allow direct observation of leukocytes
migration. Furthermore, these in vitro assays require a setup oriented
in parallel to the direction of gravity for use during extended periods
of time. As a result, the process of leukocyte adhesion to the cultured
endothelium may be influenced by gravity in addition to adhesion molecules
and/or the concentration gradient of chemoattractants under investigation.
The attempts to integrate the Boyden chamber with shear flow conditions13,14 to monitor cell migration have been limited by the high cost (large
volumes of media) and inability of capturing the dynamic behavior
of cell migration (since these attempts rely on end-point measurements).
Three-dimensional models of leukocyte migration can better mimic the
microenvironment using extracellular matrix components, such as synthetic
nanofiber scaffolds, Puramatrix from 3DM Inc., collagens, or Matrigel.15,16 However, this leads to additional problems, such as cell clumping;
making it nearly impossible to quantify the number of cells migrated.
Additional problems, such as difficulty in setup and the influence
of the stiffness of matrix on the migration process,17 also limit the application of these devices.

Although
there are devices available to study rolling, adhesion,
and migration separately, there is no in vitro model that can simultaneously
study the entire leukocyte adhesion cascade comprising of rolling,
adhesion, and migration. Previously, our group has developed a microfluidic device that reproduces
the geometry of microvessels on a chip.18,19 In this study,
we developed a novel bioinspired microfluidic device that enables
a single assay to capture the entire leukocyte adhesion cascade in
a synthetic microvascular network mimicking in vivo physiological
conditions. We have validated this novel assay against in vivo data
and used it to test the hypothesis that blockers/suppressors of specific
steps in the adhesion/migration cascade can affect other steps of
the adhesion/migration cascade. This in vivo mimetic assay has realistic
microvasculature geometry with physiological shear conditions and
allows direct observation and quantification of leukocytes rolling,
adhesion, and migration over time.

In Vitro
Experimental Procedures
Fabrication of the bMFA
Previously,
our group has developed
a methodology for digitization and fabrication of microfluidic devices
based on in vivo microvascular networks.19 A modified Geographic Information System (GIS) approach was used
to digitize the microvascular networks. The largest tissue area from
the network was selected, and the vascular wall adjacent to the area
was modified in AutoCAD to include a 3 μm pore size, the most
common and optimum for studying leukocyte migration.20−22 Briefly, the fabrication of the microfluidic devices starts with
lithographically patterning SU-8 photoresist on Si wafers. To achieve
the multiple heights associated with the vascular channels, barrier,
and tissue compartment area, multiple layers of SU-8 are spin-coated
and patterned. Microfabricated pillars (10 μm diameter) were
used to fabricate the 3 μm pores with a width of 100 μm
connecting the vascular and tissue compartments. Once the SU-8 microfluidic
features were patterned, the 1:10 w/w ratio of Sylgard 184 silicone
elastomer base and curing agent (Dow Corning, Midland, MI) was poured
over the master and cured. Subsequently, the cured polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) was peeled from the SU-8 master, followed by punching of inlet/outlet
ports, and plasma bonded to a glass slide cleaned to remove organic
species. The schematic of the device used in this study is shown in
Figure 1A.

the bMFA. The vascular channels
(100 μm width; 100 μm height) are separated from the tissue

Magnified images of endothelial cells in phase contrast and fluorescence
(scale bar is 500 μm). Dark shadows in (B and D), as well as
the bright fluorescent spot in (C), are from the tubes connecting
the tissue compartment to the syringe pump.

Testing of the bMFA
Fluorescent dye, fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at a concentration of 100 μg/mL
was injected into the vascular channels of the device to evaluate
the integrity of the fabricated 3 μm pore size barrier. As shown
in Figure 1C, the vascular network and the
tissue compartment are fluorescent with a darker bridge between them,
indicating an intact 3 μm barrier connecting the two compartments.

Seeding of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells into the bMFA
With the use of our established protocol,23 the fabricated device was degassed and then washed with sterile
DI water. The device was then incubated with fibronectin (100 μg/mL)
for 1 h. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (Lonza, Walkersville,
MD) were introduced and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Media was replaced every 24 h until the cells were confluent in
the device. As shown in Figure 1, panels E
and G, endothelial cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/mL;
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to show viability. Confluent endothelial
cells were activated with 10 units/mL of TNF-α for 4 h before
the experiments.

Neutrophil Isolation and Labeling
Human blood was obtained
via venipuncture from healthy adult donors and collected into a sterile
tube containing sodium heparin (BD Biosciences) after informed consent
was obtained as approved by the Institutional Review Board of Temple
University. Neutrophils were then isolated using a one-step Ficoll-Plaque
gradient (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). After isolation, neutrophils
were counted and resuspended in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS)
(3 × 106 cells/mL). Neutrophils were labeled in suspension
using CFDA SE probe (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) for 10 min at
room temperature. The labeled neutrophil solution was washed with
HBSS and resuspended in prewarmed endothelial cell media containing
10 units/mL of TNF-α and kept in the incubator for 10 min prior
the experiments.

Physiological Shear Experiments
The tissue compartment
of the device was filled with a chemotactic concentration of fMLP
(1 μM; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) prior to the experiments.24 The flow rate at the inlet was fixed at 1 μL/min
using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, PhD Ultra) for injection
of about 3000 labeled neutrophils per minute. The neutrophils were
kept at 37 °C using a custom-made syringe warmer. Previously,
we have developed a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based model
to calculate various flow parameters (e.g., shear stress, velocity,
etc.) at different locations in the network;18 this CFD model was used in the current study to calculate flow parameters
(shear rates less than 500 1/sec) in different channels of the network.
Video clips were recorded at 30 fps using a Rolera Bolt camera (QImaging,
Surrey, BC, Canada). After 10 min of flowing neutrophils into the
device, PBS was flown through the syringe from the inlet port for
about 5 min to completely wash off unbound neutrophils. A scan of
the entire device at the 10× objective was performed using an
automated stage on an epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE200,
Melville, NY). The acquired images and videos were postprocessed using
Nikon Elements software.

Blocking Experiments
As mentioned
before, a novel feature
of this device is the ability to study the entire leukocyte adhesion
cascade in a single assay. The two primary classes of adhesion molecules
involved in the adhesion cascade are selectins (responsible for rolling)
and integrins/immunoglobulins (responsible for adhesion). In order
to demonstrate that our device can accurately mimic the entire leukocyte
adhesion cascade, we inhibited the role of E-selectin and ICAM-1,
which are key molecules from the selectin and integrin/immunoglobulin
families, respectively, on HUVECs. We introduced mAb (anti-Eselectin
or anti-ICAM-1) into the vascular channels of the bMFA at a concentration
of 20 μg/mL and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min prior to
the experiments. We also used wortmannin, a fungal metabolite, which
has been shown to inhibit fMLP-dependent leukocyte migration.25 Wortmannin (50 nM) was mixed with neutrophils
and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min prior to injection into the
bMFA.

Data Analysis
The numbers of adherent, rolling, and
migrating neutrophils were quantified in the bMFA using NIKON Elements.
Any neutrophil traveling at a velocity below the critical velocity
was considered a rolling cell. Critical velocity was estimated from
a cell velocity flowing in the centerline (vcc) as vcrit = vcc × ε × (2 – ε), where ε
is the cell-to-vessel diameter ratio.26 Any cell that did not move for 30 s was considered adherent. The
distance of each of the adhered neutrophils to the nearest bifurcation
was measured for each branch of bMFA. The distance of adhered neutrophils
to the nearest upstream bifurcation was normalized by dividing by
the diameter of the channel:  

In Vivo Experimental Procedures
All in vivo protocols
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
Temple University. Male C57BL mice (6–8 weeks of age) were
purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). The open cremaster
muscle preparation surgical procedure used in this study has been
described before.27 Briefly, mice were
treated with TNF-α (500 ng/animal) by testicular injection 4
h before surgery. An initial tracheotomy was performed on each mouse
to facilitate breathing throughout the experiment. After, the mouse
cremaster muscle was cut, flattened, and pinned on a surgery board,
and a fluorescent dye, rhodamine 6G (0.4 mg/kg body weight; Sigma,
St. Louis, MO), was injected through the cannulated right jugular
vein to label the leukocytes.

Data Analysis
A Nikon Eclipse FN1
fluorescence microscope
was used to obtain the images of labeled leukocytes. The images were
taken under 10× magnification with a digital camera (Rolera Bolt,
QImaging, Surrey, BC, Canada) and controlled by Micro-Manager software
(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). As described above,
any leukocyte traveling at a velocity below the critical velocity
was considered a rolling cell. Leukocytes that were immobilized for
a minimum of 30 s were identified as firmly adhered leukocytes on
the vessel wall. The distance to the nearest bifurcation for each
adhering leukocytes was then measured in each network. As described
above, the spatial distribution of leukocyte adhesion was measured
in terms of the distance to the nearest bifurcation divided by vessel
diameter.

Results and Discussion
Device Characterization
In this study, we have developed
a novel microfluidic based assay that includes vascular networks in
communication with a tissue compartment filled with chemoattractant
(fMLP) via a 3 μm porous barrier (Figure 1A). This bioinspired microfluidic assay is patterned upon a Geographic
Information System (GIS)-based mapping of microvascular networks obtained
by intravital microscopy of rodent vasculature28,29 and allows for the study of the entire leukocyte adhesion cascade.
Figure 1B shows an image of the fabricated
device and Figure 1C shows the FITC-perfused
device indicating the fully functional barrier and the vascular and
tissue compartments. Endothelial cells were successfully grown to
confluence in the bMFA and oriented in the direction of flow (Figure 1, panels D and F). The viability of these endothelial
cells was verified by staining with the Hoechst dye (Figure 1, panels E and G).

Due to the complex, changing
nature of flow in the replicated network in this assay, the shear
rate at different locations of the network cannot be directly calculated.
However, we have developed a database of shear-based analysis for
varying inlet flow conditions in these devices.18 We used these simulation flow profiles for analyzing the
varying shear at different locations of the network and studying how
it affects the neutrophil rolling adhesion and migration processes.
At the flow rates used in this study, shear rates in the bMFA vessels
ranged from 0–280 1/sec.

Rolling Step of the Neutrophil–Endothelial
Interaction
Neutrophils displayed rolling behavior on a monolayer
of activated
endothelial cells in the bMFA similar to those observed in vivo [see
Video clip S-1 (002.mov) of the Supporting Information]. Time lapse images of neutrophil rolling, adhesion, and migration
in the bMFA (Figure 2) shows adhesive patterns
seen in vivo. As shown in Figure 3, rolling
velocities of neutrophils measured in bMFA are in the same range of
the rolling velocities of leukocytes measured in vivo. Our findings
indicate that the average rolling velocity of neutrophils in bMFA
(45.2 ± 1.7 μm/sec, mean ± SEM) was similar to the
average rolling velocity of leukocytes in vivo (48.0 ± 1.3 μm/sec),
and that there was no statistically significant difference between
the in vivo and in vitro groups (P = 0.758; Man-Whitney Rank Sum Test).

in vivo;

in vivo in a mouse cremaster muscle model (N = 5)
and rolling neutrophils velocity in vitro in the bMFA (N = 3). The horizontal line within the box indicates the median, boundaries
of the box indicate the 25th and 75th percentile, and the whiskers
indicate the highest and lowest values of the results. The “+”
marked in the box indicates the mean. Rolling velocity of neutrophils
measured in vitro in the bMFA was not significantly different from
leukocytes rolling velocity in vivo (p = 0.758; Mann–Whitney
Rank Sum Test). Instantaneous rolling velocities, average velocity,
and velocity variance were measured using frame-by-frame analysis
over 30 s intervals for each device (average of 600 neutrophils analyzed
per device).

Adhesion Step of the Neutrophil–Endothelial
Interaction
Previously, we have shown that both functionalized
particles in
vitro and leukocytes in vivo preferentially adhere near bifurcations.27 Neutrophils in bMFA also preferentially adhered
within 1–2 diameters from the nearest bifurcation, and the
number of adhered neutrophils decreased with an increasing distance
from the nearest bifurcation (Figure 4). Furthermore,
data shown in Figure 4 also indicate that the
spatial pattern of neutrophil adhesion in bMFA was similar to leukocyte
adhesion patterns in vivo. Furthermore, consistent with previous studies,23,30,31 neutrophil adhesion was found
to be minimal in high shear regions (shear rate >120 1/sec) and
maximal
in low shear regions of bMFA, indicating that fluidic shear strongly
influences cell adhesion in these microvascular networks (Figure 5).

Figure 4 Neutrophil adhesion in bMFA is similar to leukocyte adhesion
in
vivo; distribution of the number of adhered leukocytes and neutrophils
as a function of distance from the nearest bifurcation in vivo in
mouse cremaster muscle model and in vitro in bMFA, respectively. Both
histograms are skewed to the left, indicating that leukocytes and
neutrophils preferentially adhere near bifurcations with the peak
occurring at one vessel or channel diameter from the nearest bifurcation
(mean ± SEM; N = 3).

Figure 5 Neutrophil adhesion in bMFA is shear dependent; the number of adhering
neutrophils in various channels of bMFA decreases significantly with
shear stress in that channel (mean ± SEM, N =
3) (**P < 0.01, ANOVA).

Migration Step of the Neutrophil–Endothelial Interaction
Movement of neutrophils from the vascular to the tissue compartment
was monitored by obtaining images from the entire device every 3 min
for 2 h [see Video clip S-2 (003.mov) of the Supporting
Information]. Our findings indicate that neutrophil migration
in the bMFA exponentially increased with time. In particular, 5% of
the adhered neutrophils started to migrate into the chemoattractant-filled
tissue compartment after 10 min, reaching 50% after 120 min (Figure 6). In control experiments, where the tissue compartment
was filled with cell culture media, the percentage of migrated neutrophils
was significantly lower than the case where the tissue compartment
was filled with fMLP (Figure 6). Furthermore,
during these experiments, we observed higher cell migration at a location
in the network where the shear rate was in the range of 30–60
1/sec.

Figure 6 Neutrophil migration in bMFA is time dependent; adhered neutrophils
migrate into the tissue compartment filled with fMLP over time. This
migration exponentially increases with time, reaching 50% of adhering
neutrophils having migrated into the tissue compartment after 120
min but is significantly blocked by treatment of neutrophils with
wortmannin. The control experiments were performed filling the tissue
compartment with media (mean ± SEM; N = 3) (* P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, ANOVA).

Blocking Specific Steps
of the Adhesion/Migration Cascade Significantly
Affects Other Steps of the Cascade
To further validate the
system, we tested the hypothesis that blocking of specific steps in
the adhesion/migration cascade significantly affects other steps of
the cascade. Treatment of activated HUVECs with the E-selectin antibody
not only significantly reduced the number of rolling neutrophils to
∼60% (p < 0.05) of its control value but
also reduced adherent neutrophils to 40% (p = 0.024)
and migrated neutrophils to less than 10% (p <
0.001) of their respective control values (Figure 7). Similarly, treatment with the ICAM-1 antibody not only
reduced adhesion to 20% (p = 0.007) of its control
value but also reduced rolling to 80% (p < 0.05)
and migration to less than 10% (p < 0.001) of
their respective control values (Figure 7).
On the other hand, treating neutrophils with wortmannin significantly
decreased the number of migrating neutrophils at time points of 30
min (p = 0.009), 60 min (p <
0.001), and 120 min (p < 0.001) (Figure 6) but did not result in any significant changes
in rolling and adhesion of neutrophils (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Antibody blocking of specific steps in the adhesion/migration cascade
downregulates other steps of the cascade; monoclonal antibodies against
E-selectin (aE-selectin), ICAM-1(aICAM-1), and PI3K (wortmannin) significantly
reduced the number of rolling, adhering, and migrating neutrophils
in bMFA. The numbers represent the percentage of activity after treating
cells with the respective blockers in comparison to their corresponding
control values (mean ± SEM; N = 3).

The assay developed in this study provides a morphologically
realistic
environment and physiological flow conditions similar to in vivo microvascular
networks and can be used to simultaneously study all the steps (rolling,
adhesion, and migration) of leukocyte adhesion cascade in a single
system. We characterized this assay by culturing a confluent monolayer
of human endothelial cells and activating them with cytokines (TNF-α)
to study the interactions of human neutrophils with inflamed endothelium.
We validated this system by comparing our findings with an in vivo
mouse model using intravital microscopy. This assay was used to validate
the hypothesis that antibody blocking of specific steps in the adhesion/migration
cascade (e.g., mAb to E-selectin) significantly downregulates other
steps of the cascade (e.g., migration). The system developed in this
study has many advantages, including the fact that a complete testing
of the latter hypothesis in a single device would not be possible
using traditional flow chambers and/or transwell systems.

Our
in vivo findings indicate that leukocyte rolling velocity in
inflamed cremaster muscle venules (diameter 40–110 μm)
ranged from 2 to 120 μm/sec, with blood flow velocities ranging
from 0.5 to 1 mm/sec, which are consistent with other reports.32 Furthermore, neutrophil rolling velocity in
the bMFA was not significantly different from those measured in vivo.
An advantage of our in vitro assay is that it allows for detailed
investigation of the effects of shear forces on leukocyte–endothelial
interactions.

Leukocyte adhesion results from the balance between
molecular adhesive
forces and disruptive hemodynamic forces exerted by flowing blood.33 We23 and others34 have previously shown that the presence of flow
fluctuations in microvascular networks favors particle adhesion at
junctions. Our findings in the current study indicate that neutrophil
adhesion patterns in our in vitro bMFA predict the trends observed
in vivo. Specifically, neutrophils preferentially adhere near bifurcations,
supporting the hypothesis that the hemodynamic forces present in vivo
can be replicated in an in vitro system characterized by the same
geometric and fluidic features.27,35This is the first two-arm
study to show that neutrophil–endothelial adhesion patterns
in an in vitro microvascular network is very similar to the adhesion
patterns of leukocytes observed in vivo. Furthermore, these findings
illustrate an important advantage of bMFA in that characterizing the
spatial pattern of particle/leukocyte adhesion to endothelium near
bifurcations, for example, is not possible with traditional fluidic
devices such as parallel plate flow chambers.

In order to further
validate this assay, we blocked individual
steps of the leukocyte adhesion cascade using specific inhibitors
of rolling, adhesion, and migration. Our results indicate that rolling
and adhesion of neutrophils in bMFA can be significantly reduced when
endothelial cells are treated with antibodies against selectins or
integrins. These findings are consistent with previous findings from
our laboratory36 and others37 on the effects of mAb against selectins or integrins
on rolling and adherent leukocyte in rat mesenteric or brain venules.
In agreement with other studies38,39 which have shown that
treatment of endothelial cells with mAbs against selectins or integrins
also significantly reduces transendothelial migration of leukocytes,
migration of neutrophils into the tissue compartment of bMFA was significantly
reduced in the presence of antibodies to E-selectin or ICAM-1. One
may hypothesize that the effects of antibody blocking on migration
may simply be due to the lower number of adhered neutrophils in the
proximity of the tissue compartment. However, in our study, ∼50%
of adhered neutrophils migrated into the tissue compartment in the
control experiments while only ∼20% of adhered cells migrated
into the tissue compartment with anti-ICAM-1-treated endothelial cells.
Thus, further studies are required to determine what other factors
may be involved in this process. Consistent with other reports in
the literature,25,40 wortmannin significantly reduced
migration of neutrophils into the tissue compartment, suggesting that
the migratory stage of neutrophil response during inflammation may
be an appropriate target for therapeutics.

The multistep leukocyte
adhesion cascade is a dynamic phenomenon,
and its understanding often requires real-time monitoring of the entire
process. Our novel microfluidic assay allows for the multistep analysis
of the complex leukocyte adhesion and migration and integrates many
aspects of leukocyte–endothelial interaction in a single assay.
This assay can mimic physiological conditions and enables real-time
monitoring of cell migration through endothelial cell junctions, which
is generally considered the dominant route by which leukocytes penetrate
the endothelial cell barrier under physiological flow conditions.41 The bMFA can also be used to study the influence
of various compounds that simulate the extracellular matrix through
which directional neutrophil migration can be accomplished. For example,
multiple tissue compartment areas can be filled with different chemoattractant
solutions and concentrations to understand in a realistic environment
the balance of hydrodynamic shear forces, rolling, adhesion, and subsequent
migration. Similarly, the role of various inflammatory molecules and
blockers may be studied in real-time for elucidation of their mechanisms
and development of next generation of anti-inflammatory therapeutics.
Furthermore, this system permits studies of the effects of pulsatile
flow on particle–cell interactions.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have developed and validated a novel bioinspired
microfluidic assay that closely mimics physiological conditions of
leukocytes rolling, adhesion/migration cascade observed in vivo during
the inflammatory process. This realistic fluidic model allows for
in vitro reconstitution of the microvascular environment using human
cells and thus allows for screening of therapeutics on human cells.
The bMFA has a number of other advantages, including flow and morphologically
realistic environment, ability to model adhesion and migration in
the same system, quantitative real-time visualization, reduced reagents,
and use of disposable chips. Furthermore, this system can be further
developed for high throughput analysis.
