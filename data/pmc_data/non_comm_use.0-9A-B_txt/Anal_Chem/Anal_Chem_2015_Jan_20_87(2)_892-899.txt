Post-translational addition of methyl
groups to the amino terminal
tails of histone proteins regulates cellular gene expression at various
stages of development and the pathogenesis of cellular diseases, including
cancer. Several enzymes that modulate these post-translational modifications
of histones are promising targets for development of small molecule
drugs. However, there is no promising real-time histone methylation
detection tool currently available to screen and validate potential
small molecule histone methylation modulators in small animal models.
With this in mind, we developed genetically encoded molecular biosensors
based on the split-enzyme complementation approach for in vitro and
in vivo imaging of lysine 9 (H3–K9 sensor) and lysine 27 (H3–K27
sensor) methylation marks of histone 3. These methylation sensors
were validated in vitro in HEK293T, HepG2, and HeLa cells. The efficiency
of the histone methylation sensor was assessed by employing methyltransferase
inhibitors (Bix01294 and UNC0638), demethylase inhibitor (JIB-04),
and siRNA silencing at the endogenous histone K9-methyltransferase
enzyme level. Furthermore, noninvasive bioluminescence imaging of
histone methylation sensors confirmed the potential of these sensors
in monitoring histone methylation status in response to histone methyltransferase
inhibitors in living animals. Experimental results confirmed that
the developed H3–K9 and H3–K27 sensors are specific
and sensitive to image the drug-induced histone methylation changes
in living animals. These novel histone methylation sensors can facilitate
the in vitro screening and in vivo characterization of new histone
methyltransferase inhibitors and accelerate the pace of introduction
of epigenetic therapies into the clinic.

Epigenetics
is a rapidly expanding
area of biomedical research that studies phenomena of heritable changes
in genome functions that occur without changes in the underlying DNA
sequence. The epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA-methylation, histone
acetylation, and histone methylation, are important for cellular development,
differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis.1,2 Furthermore,
the epigenetic mechanisms are believed to respond to different chemical
and physical agents, and may lead to altered biological pathways associated
with cellular diseases.3 More recent discoveries
on functional mechanisms of epigenetic processes indicate that most
of these epigenetic processes are heritable.4,5 Although
most of the epigenetic processes are heritable, recent findings have
confirmed that they are also reversible, making them
potentially valuable therapeutic targets in treating various diseases.

One of the important epigenetic mechanisms involves methylation
of histone core proteins H3 and H4 by methyltransferases, particularly
on the side-chain nitrogen atoms of lysine and/or arginine residues.6 Lysine methylation predominantly occurs in K4,
K9, K27, K36, and K79 of histone 3 (H3), and K20 of histone 4 (H4).
Histone methylations such as H3–K9, H3–K27, and H4–K20
are mainly involved in the formation and maintenance of silent heterochromatin
state, whereas methylations at H3–K4, H3–K36, and H3–K79
are associated with actively transcribing euchromatic regions.7 Although acetylation directly correlates with
transcriptional activation, histone lysine methylation can be involved
in both transcriptional activation and repression.8

The heterochromatic complex is essential for chromosome
organization,
maintenance of genomic integrity, and inheritance. H3–K9 methylation
was shown to be predominantly associated with heterochromatin formation,
particularly with X-chromosome inactivation and DNA methylation.9 To a certain extent, the H3–K9 methylation
is also associated with transcriptional regulation of some important
genes.10 The functional effects of histone
lysine methylations are mediated by various effector proteins, which
possess methylated lysine-binding chromodomains. The specificity of
chromodomains of effector proteins in binding to methylated lysine
residues of histone proteins is so accurate that they can even distinguish
the location of methylated lysines and the number of methylations
(mono-, di-, or tri-) occurring in each of these lysine residues.11 The methylation of lysine residues by histone
methyltransferases (HMTs) recruits chromodomain of different proteins,
which recognize and form a complex that can functionally remodel chromatin
structure and regulate gene expression in response to the external
stimuli.12,13 Most interestingly, histone modifications
are reversible; the balance between N-tail histone
methylation and demethylation in lysine and arginine residues at different
positions can regulate expression levels of different proteins and
control cellular homeostasis.14 It is now
clearly understood that by regulating histone methylation, the gene
expression profile of a cell can be manipulated. Several conventional
methods are currently available to detect methylation levels of histone
proteins in cell lysates, but none of them could be employed for real-time
monitoring of histone methylation status of cells in living animals.15,16 Addition of a new efficient imaging strategy could accelerate the
process of development and preclinical evaluation of novel inhibitors
of histone methyltransferases.

In the current study, we used
split-Renilla luciferase complementation
system to develop sensors, which can image methylation in H3–K9
and H3–K27 marks. We constructed plasmid vectors expressing
these sensor fusion proteins to monitor methylations occurring at
specific locations in N-terminal tail of histone proteins (K9 and
K27). These sensors become activated when either the K9 or K27 become
methylated and bind with the Suv39H1 or Pc2 domains that bring two
halves of split-RLuc together, reconstitute its enzymatic activity,
and activate bioluminescence that can be imaged in cells in vitro,
and in vivo in living animals. The functionality and specificity of
these histone methylation sensors was successfully demonstrated in
response to methyltransferase and demethylase inhibitors in cell lines,
and noninvasive repetitive bioluminescence imaging in living animals.

Materials
and Methods
Plasmid Vector Construction
Fusion constructs were
generated by cloning PCR-amplified cDNA of Suv39H1 and Pc2 with pcDNA3.1
(+) eukaryotic expression vector into Kpn1 and BamH1 restriction sites,
followed by the incorporation of K9- and K27-sensor oligonucleotides
into EcoR1 and Xho1 sites and the (G4S)3 linker
sequence (GGGGSGGGGSGGGGS) at BamH1 and EcoR1 sites in between Suv39H1
and K9 sensor peptide sequence. The entire fusion was flanked by N-
and C-terminal fragments of Renilla luciferase 8.6 (RLuc8.6) and Renilla
luciferase (RLuc) respectively. H3–K9 and H3–K27 mutant
clones were generated by replacing codon for lysine with leucine.
Full length FLuc express under a constitutive ubiquitin promoter was
used for cotransfection.

Results and Discussion
Design,
Construction, and Optimization of Bioluminescent Histone
Methylation Imaging Sensors in Cells
We adopted the concept
of intramolecular conformational change that occurs within a protein
in response to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation,
methylation, acetylation, and so forth, to design our split-reporter
complementation-based histone methylation sensors (Figure 1). The versatility of the split reporter complementation
system has been shown by our previous studies in imaging protein–protein
interactions and protein folding.17−21 Recently split-reporters has been extended to study
various epigenetic modifications such as phosphorylation,22,23 ubiquitylation,24 and DNA methylation25 that occurs in cells. In addition to the use
of split-reporter complementation systems, Kanno et al. developed
a FRET sensor to detect histone acetylation,26 whereas Lin et al. used the FRET sensor to image histone methylation15 in live cells. Similarly, a few other fluorescent-based
probes have been developed to image histone acetylation in cells and
small animals.27,28 In this study, we extended the
potential of split reporter complementation system to image protein
methylation by Renilla luciferase (RLuc) complementation system. The
H3–K9 and H3–K27 methylation sensors were constructed
independently using substrate domains (K9: ARTKQTARKSTGG;
K27: TKAARKSAPATGG) derived from histone 3 (H3). Chromodomain
derived from either HP1 protein or histone-lysine N-methyltransferase (Suv39H1) was used for the K9 sensor, and polycomb
protein 2 (Pc2) was used for the K27 sensor, as interacting partners
(Supporting Information Figure S1). A flexible
linker with three time repeats of GGGGS ([G4S]3) was used to link the methylation domain and the interacting substrate
domain, in order to facilitate the proximity interaction of these
domains during complementation. The sensors were sandwiched between
N- and C-terminal domains of the split-Renilla luciferase protein
(RLuc8.6) so that optimal enzyme complementation could be achieved
as the result of interaction of methylated K9 or K27 peptides with
corresponding methyl-lysine binding domains of HP1, Pc2, or Suv39H1.
The system was studied in transfected mammalian cells. The dissociation
constant of methylated H3–K9 peptide with HP1 chromodomain
has been reported to be 2.14 μM as assessed by Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance.29 Similarly, the binding constant
assessed by isothermal calorimetric titration assay for HP1 has been
estimated to be 7 μM for dimethyl H3–K9 peptide and 2.5
μM for trimethyl H3–K9 peptide.30 The H3–K9 sensor developed in the present study is expressed
approximately at 15 μM in transfected cells (calculated using
the band intensity of Western blot analysis of sensor proteins by
FLAG antibody by comparing with tubulin31). Further, the sensor generates signal by interacting through intramolecular
interaction of methylated H3–K9 peptide and chromodomain positioned
within the same fusion protein. Therefore, the H3–K9 sensor
developed in this study is capable of generating significant luciferase
signal upon methylation and also can respond to changes in the level
of methylation. However, this evaluation may have some variations
because binding affinity of antibodies used for various target proteins
in Western blot analysis is different.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration
of the concept and the design of histone
methylation imaging sensor.

In general, histone 3 with K9 methylation is abundant in
transcriptionally
repressive heterochromatic regions.32 This
process occurs through interaction of K9-methylated histone 3 with
the chromodomain of heterochromatin-associated protein 1 (HP1). Considering
the sensitivity, initially we constructed H3–K9 (ARTKQTARKSTGG) and its respective mutant (H3-L9: ARTKQTARLSTGG) sensors using substrate chromodomain from HP1 protein, and
the split-Renilla luciferase fragments of selective split site at
amino acid position 229 (NhRLuc: 1–229; ChRLuc: 229–311).
The sequence-confirmed vectors were studied in transiently transfected
HEK293T cells by assaying for reconstituted RLuc activity. The results
revealed an approximately 20-fold difference between the H3–K9
and H3–L9 sensor (5 ± 0.5 x106 photons/sec
vs 2.5 ± 0.5 x105 photons/sec). The background photon
flux was 1.2 ± 0.2 x105 photons/sec). Because the
aim of this study was to develop a sensor that could image histone
methylation status in living animals, we further improved the sensitivity
of the sensor by testing the N- and C-terminal fragments of a red-shifted
(emission: 535 nm) mutant RLuc (RLuc8.6535), which we have
previously developed for improved RLuc protein stability.33 We generated four different sensor constructs
with rational N- and C-terminal luciferase fragment combinations (Supporting Information Figure S1), and we tested
them in transfected HEK293T cells. The results showed a 4-fold increase
in sensor signal when NhRLuc fragment in the initial sensor was replaced
with NhRLuc8.6 [(Figure 2A), Nhrl-HP1-K9-Chrl
vs Nhrl8.6-HP1-K9-Chrl)]. We used this particular combination of N-
and C-terminal luciferase fragments for additional optimizations and
for constructing various other sensors (H3–K9 and H3–K27)
that were employed in this study. The maximum luminescence spectrum
(λ-max) of Nhrl8.6-HP1-K9-Chrl matched with the emission spectrum
of RLuc8.6535 (Supporting Information Figure S2).

analysis of cell lysates of respective samples in graph using EGFP

experiments, the constructs with RLuc reporter fragments and the interacting
protein fragments are in the order they appear in the X-axis labels.

After our initial evaluation
of H3–K9 sensor with chromodomain
from HP1, a complex responsible for heterochromatin formation, we
assessed the functional specificity of these sensors by introducing
chromodomains from other proteins, which are involved in transcriptional
regulation of gene expression. We selected chromodomain from polycomb
2 (Pc2) and suppressor of variegation 3-9 homologue 1 (Suv39H1). The
Pc2 protein is mainly associated with transcriptionally repressive
chromatin, especially in X-chromosome inactivation, by interacting
with methylated histone 3 at K27.34 The
polycomb group (PcG) of proteins has recently been identified to interact
with Suv39H1 through methylated H3–K9, and is involved in transcriptional
repression in other active complexes. Suv39H1 is a histone-lysine N-methyltransferase enzyme that possesses the chromodomain
and the SET domain, which can interact with H3 protein while methylating
K9. The vectors expressing H3–K9 sensor with chromodomain from
HP1 and Suv39H1, and H3–K27 sensor with Pc2-chromodomain was
studied in transiently transfected HEK293T cells and assessed for
reconstituted RLuc bioluminescence activity. The results demonstrated
significant levels of bioluminescent signal from H3–K9 sensor
consisting of chromodomain from Suv39H1 and H3–K27 sensor consisting
of Pc2 chromodomain (Supporting Information Figure S3). The sensor containing the HP1 chromodomain showed a
low level of bioluminescent signal. Although the levels of bioluminescent
signals from reconstituted RLuc were different for different sensors,
the expression levels of individual sensor proteins did not differ
significantly in the transfected cells.

Because the chromodomains
of Suv39H1 and HP1 are known to interact
with both di- and tri-methylated H3–K9,35−37 the complementation
signal measured in this study is a combination of signals achieved
from the interaction of chromodomains with both di- and tri-methylated
H3–K9. The mono, di-, and tri-methylation in the H3–K9
mark by different histone methyl transferases controls chromatin organization
in cells at various cellular conditions. Although trimethylation in
the H3–K9 mark recruits HP1 and contributes for condensed heterochromatin,
the mono- and di-methylations of the same have been associated with
regulatory repressive function in euchromatic regions.38,39

Furthermore, when trimethylation
of H3–K9 by Suv39H1 methyltransferase
recruits the HP1 chromodomain to regulate heterochromatin, mono- and
di- methylation of the same mark by G9a methyltransferase regulates
selective repression of gene expression in euchromatic regions during
embryonic development.40 Hence the broad
specificity of the split reporter complementation sensor with the
chromodomains from Suv39H1 and HP1 is useful in measuring global methylation
status of the H3–K9 mark, but it is not capable to distinguish
the specific degree of methylations in this particular mark. Further
investigations by replacing Suv39H1 chromodomain with other domains
from the royal family of proteins40 can
improve the specificity of the H3–K9 sensor capable of detecting
mono-, di-, and tri-methylation of the H3–K9 mark discretely
to screen small molecule drugs altering a specific degree of H3–K9
methylation implicated in various cellular diseases.41

To further test the hypothesis that increasing the
number of chromodomains
and K9 substrate peptide domains could improve sensor imaging signal,
we generated three additional constructs in which we either duplicated
both K9 and Suv39H1 domains [K9-Suv39H1-(G4S)3-Suv39H1-K9 and Suv39H1-Suv39H1-(G4S)3-K9-K9],
or duplicated only the chromodomain alone [Suv39H1-(G4S)3-Suv39H1-K9] (Supporting Information Figure S1); these sensor constructs were studied in transiently
transfected HEK293T cells. The multiplication of interacting domains
in these sensors resulted significant drop in bioluminescence signals
from all the tested multidomain sensor constructs (Figure 2B). Therefore, for the rest of the studies, we used
constructs containing only one pair of interacting partners.

To validate whether it is possible to detect methylation of the
K9 domain positioned within the imaging sensor by methylation-specific
H3–K9-antibody, we constructed wild type and mutant sensors
with C-terminal FLAG peptide sequence to facilitate selective immunoprecipitation
and further confirmation. No significant differences in the absolute
level of protein expression were observed other than a minor drop
in bioluminescence signals when comparing sensors with and without
C-terminal FLAG peptide fusion (Supporting Information Figure S4A,B).

The proteins from cell lysates of HEK293T cells
transfected with
equal amounts of vector constructs expressing H3–K9 or respective
mutant (H3–L9) sensors immunoprecipitated by FLAG specific
antibody, were detectable with anti-Dimethyl-K9 and anti-FLAG specific
antibodies. The endogenous dimethylated K9 of H3-protein from the
whole cell lysates of the respective samples was also detectable by
anti-Dimethyl-K9 antibody (Figure 2C,D and Figure S4B). We also observed some level of sensor
protein in H3–L9 transfected cells, which might be due to the
nonspecific nature of Dimethyl-K9 antibody used for immunoblot analysis.

Effect of Nuclear Localization
Signal (NLS) Peptide on H3–K9 Methylation Sensor Signal
Histone methylations are enzymatic processes that occur in the nucleus
and are executed by histone methyltransferases.6,7 Histone
methyltransferases are predominantly located in the nucleus. HP1,
Pc2, and Suv39H1 are chromodomain-containing proteins that possess
inherent nuclear localization signal peptide within their protein
sequence. Although, the protein fragments with chromodomains derived
from these nuclear proteins could mediate nuclear translocation of
sensor proteins and help sensors achieve histone methylations, we
tested whether the addition of NLS signal peptide to these sensor
proteins can improve sensor signal. Therefore, we constructed additional
vectors that express sensor proteins with NLS signal peptide tagged
in the C-terminus (NhRluc8.6-Suv39H1–H3–K9-ChRLuc-NLS
and NhRluc8.6-Suv39H1–H3-L9-ChRLuc-NLS) and sensors with C-terminal
EGFP- with and without N-terminal NLS tag (NhRLuc8.6-Suv39H1–H3–K9-ChRLuc-EGFP
and NLS-NhRLuc8.6-Suv39H1–H3–K9-ChRLuc-EGFP) (Supporting Information Figure S1). HEK293T cells
were transfected to stably express these sensors and the subcellular
localization of EGFP-tagged sensor proteins was analyzed using confocal
microscopy. Confocal microscopy clearly showed the distribution of
EGFP signal mostly in the cytoplasm of cells expressing sensor without
NLS, whereas cells expressing the sensor with NLS showed signal both
in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Figure 2E). Importantly,
the addition of NLS resulted in a significant improvement in sensitivity
of histone methylation sensors as manifested by a 30 ± 5% increase
in reconstituted luciferase activity (Figure 2F, upper panel). Therefore, we used plasmid constructs expressing
H3–K9 and H3–L9 sensor proteins with NLS at C-terminal
end of the protein further for all in vitro and in vivo experiments.
Immunoblot analysis by EGFP specific antibody showed no variation
in the levels of sensor proteins from cells expressing the sensor
with or without NLS signal peptide (Figure 2F, lower panel).

Specificity of Split-Luciferase Complementation
Sensor in Measuring
Histone Methylations
After diligent optimization of different
components of the methylation sensor proteins to improve their sensitivity,
we then evaluated the specificity of histone methylations as measured
by these optimized sensors. Initially we constructed respective mutant
sensors (H3–L9 and H3–L27) by changing amino acid lysine
within the methylation domain of the sensor proteins to leucine (K
→ L). Similarly, we constructed a mutant H3–K9 sensor
in which amino acid tryptophan within the chromodomain Suv39H1 that
is crucial for interaction with the methylated H3–K9 was mutated
to alanine (W64A, W74A). The constructs were transfected in HEK293T
cells and assessed for reconstituted luciferase activity. Our results
demonstrated significantly lower level of complemented luciferase
signal from the sensors when amino acid lysine in respective positions
(K9 and K27) of the sensors was mutated to leucine (L9 and L27; (p < 0.01)). The H3–K9 sensor signal (5.26 ±
1.2 × 106 RLU/μg protein) was 8 ± 2 fold
higher than its respective mutant H3–L9 sensor (5.96 ±
1.5 × 105 RLU/μg protein) (Figure 3A). Similarly, the H3–K27 sensor with its interacting
chromodomain from Pc2 protein was 80 ± 10 times higher (3.67
± 0.5 × 107 RLU/μg protein) than its respective
mutant H3–L27 sensor (3.15 ± 0.5 × 105 RLU/μg protein) (Figure 3B). Moreover,
the H3–K9 sensor with the mutated Suv39H1 chromodomain (1.75
± 0.17 x106) showed more than 50% drop in luciferase
complementation as compared to the H3–K9 sensor with wild-type
Suv39H1 chromodomain (3.3 ± 0.38 x106) (Figure 3C).

in the level of G9a-methyltransferase and dimethylated H3–K9
in HEK293T cells transfected with SiRNA specific to G9a-methyltransferase
and scrambled-SiRNA.

To further confirm the specificity of sensor complementation
in
relation to the endogenous expression level for histone methyltransferases,
we used the H3–K9 sensor. The G9a histone methyltransferase
is mainly involved in methylating histone protein 3 at the K9-position.39 In addition to G9a methyltransferase, several
other methyltransferases (Suv39H1, Suv39H2, GLP, SETDB1, and SETDB2)
can also methylate H3–K9.42 To study
the effect of G9a methyltransferase (EHMT2) on H3–K9 sensor
methylation, we selected siRNA-mediated gene silencing. We tested
H3–K9 methylation sensor using luciferase assay (Figure 3D), bioluminescence imaging (Figure 3E), immunoblot analysis for endogenous G9a methyltransferase
and methylated H3–K9 sensor protein level (Figure 3F) after transfecting the HEK293T cells with 6 μM
of siRNA specific to G9a methyltransferase or scrambled siRNA. As
a result, a significant correlation was observed between G9a methyltransferase
level and sensor signal (Figure 3G).

Evaluation
of H3–K9 and H3–K27 Methylation Sensors
in Different Cell Lines
Methylation status of histones (H3
and H4) varies with the amount of specific methyltransferases and
demethylases expressed in cells. To determine the efficiency and the
generalizability of H3–K9 and H3–K27 methylation sensors,
we evaluated them in different cell lines such as HEK293T-human embryonic
kidney cancer cells, HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and HeLa
ovarian cancer cells. Plasmid constructs expressing H3–K9 and
H3–K27 with respective mutant sensors (H3–L9 and H3–L27)
were transiently transfected, and the level of bioluminescence signals
was not uniform across various cell lines included in the study (Supporting Information Figure S5).

H3–K9
Methylation Sensors in Response to the Treatment
of Different Doses of Methyltransferase and Demethylase Inhibitors
To evaluate the efficiency of the methylation sensors in response
to methyltransferase inhibitors, we created HEK293T cells stably expressing
the sensors, and we treated them with two different methyltransferase
inhibitors (Bix01294 and UNC0638). The optimal concentration of these
methyltransferase inhibitors was determined by subjecting cells to
various concentrations (Bix01294:0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 μM; UNC0638:0,
0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 μM) followed by measuring luciferase
complementation after 24 and 48 h of incubation. The Hill equation
with variable slope in GraphPad Prism 6 ((GraphPad Software, CA): Y = Bottom + (Top – Bottom)/(1 + 10∧((LogIC50 – X) * HillSlope)) was used for
Figure 4A and C, and exponential decay regression
was used to fit the results for Figure 4B and
D. The results of these studies demonstrated inhibitor concentration-dependent
decrease in luciferase reconstitution in cells expressing H3–K9
sensor (Bix01294: R2 = 0.9 and UNC0638: R2 = 0.87). In contrast, cells expressing mutant
sensor (H3–L9) showed no relationship between the magnitudes
of bioluminescence signal and the concentration of inhibitors used
for the study (Figure 4A–D). Additionally,
HEK293T cells expressing H3–K9 sensor showed a concentration-dependent
increase in luciferase signal when treated with increasing concentrations
of JIB-04, a demethylase inhibitor (Figure 4E). Lastly, the methylation imaging signal was proportional to various
concentrations of methyltransferase and demethylase inhibitors used
in this study.

The complementation
sensors we developed for this study were sensitive and robust in measuring
histone methylations in cell cultures. We further tested the feasibility
of noninvasive imaging of histone methylation status in vivo in nude
mice bearing tumor xenografts developed from different tumor cells
expressing H3–K9 sensor. Because in vivo imaging requires another
independent normalization of bioluminescence signal intensity, we
used all cell lines expressing the H3–K9 and H3–L9 (mutant)
sensors cotransfected with firefly luciferase reporter under a constitutive
ubiquitin promoter. The double-selected cells of respective sensors
with clones of cells that expressed an equal amount of FLuc at both
the mRNA and protein levels and showed an equal growth rate were used
for animal experiments (Supporting Information Figure S6). The HEK293T, HeLa, and HepG2 cells stably coexpressing
each methylation sensor (H3–K9 or H3–L9) along with
FLuc (106 cells per xenograft) were implanted subcutaneously
in the right (H3–K9) and left (H3–L9) flanks of nude
mice, and the mice were housed according to standard maintenance protocol
until tumors grew to 2–3 mm in diameter. Thereafter, repetitive
bioluminescence imaging was performed to assess histone methylation
status in tumor-bearing mice until tumors reached 10 mm in diameter.
The results of this study demonstrated the feasibility of monitoring
histone methylation status by noninvasive bioluminescence imaging.
The in vivo bioluminescence imaging from animals implanted with HEK293
(Figure 5A,B) and HeLa (Figure 5C,D) cells showed 8 ± 2-fold higher luciferase signal
from cells expressing H3–K9 sensor when compared to cells expressing
its respective mutant sensor (H3–L9). The utilization of the
dual-luciferase imaging approach enabled us to reliably quantify the
magnitude of down-regulation of histone methylation in tumor tissue
induced by treatment of mice with histone methyltransferase inhibitors
in vivo.

and H3–L9 sensors. (B) Normalized histone methylation assisted
Renilla luciferase complementation signal measured from HEK293T xenograft
expressing wild-type and mutant sensors. (C) RLuc and FLuc signals
optically imaged from the tumor xenografts of HeLa cells stably expressing
wild-type and mutant histone methylation sensors. (D) Normalized histone

wild-type and mutant sensors.

We further tested H3–K9 complementation sensor in
response
to G9a methyltransferase inhibitor Bix01294 in animals implanted with
xenograft of HepG2 cells stably expressing H3–K9 and H3–L9
sensors along with equal level of FLuc reporter for normalization.
Intratumoral injection of either PBS or Bix01294 (5 μL of 1
mg/mL Bix01294 in three different sites of tumor) in HepG2 tumors
of 2–3 mm diameter were imaged as before, and 24 h after the
injection of Bix01294 injection for both RLuc (methylation sensor
signal) and FLuc (normalization) signals. The result shows a significant
level of drop in luciferase complementation (40 ± 8%) in tumors
from animals expressing H3–K9 sensor upon receiving Bix01294
(p < 0.05). In contrast, the tumors from animals
receiving PBS showed ∼80% increase in luciferase signal (Supporting Information Figure S7).

Conclusion
Global methylations of specific histone marks are shown to be altered
in different types of cancers,41 and therefore,
tuning a specific methylation mark seems a promising therapeutic strategy.
A plethora of small molecules are explored to modulate specific histone
methylation marks, and also, research endeavors are underway to introduce
highly efficacious small molecule histone methylation modulators.
The pace of small molecule exploration is stalled due to the shortage
of tools to detect and monitor the methylation status of specific
histone methylation marks and preclinically validates them for quick
clinical translation. In this study, we developed and optimized novel
methylation sensors for noninvasive bioluminescence imaging of particular
histone methylation process in cell extracts, intact cells, and noninvasively
in living animals by using cells genetically engineered to express
these sensors. Furthermore, we confirmed the efficacy of these sensors
using noninvasive bioluminescence imaging for monitoring of pharmacodynamics
of different histone methyltransferase inhibitors in vivo in mice
bearing tumor xenografts of cells engineered to express these novel
histone methylation sensors. Preclinical utilization of these histone
methylation sensors can facilitate the in vitro screening and in vivo
characterization of novel histone methyltransferase inhibitors and
accelerate the pace of introducing epigenetic therapies into the clinic.
