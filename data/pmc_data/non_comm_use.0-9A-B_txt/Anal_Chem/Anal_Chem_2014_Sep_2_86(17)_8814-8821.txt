New
reliable and cost-effective antimalarial drug screening assays
are urgently needed to identify drugs acting on different stages of
the parasite Plasmodium falciparum,
and particularly those responsible for human-to-mosquito transmission,
that is, the P. falciparum gametocytes.
Low Z′ factors, narrow dynamic ranges, and/or
extended assay times are commonly reported in current gametocyte assays
measuring gametocyte-expressed fluorescent or luciferase reporters,
endogenous ATP levels, activity of gametocyte enzymes, or redox-dependent
dye fluorescence. We hereby report on a dual-luciferase gametocyte
assay with immature and mature P. falciparum gametocyte stages expressing red and green-emitting luciferases
from Pyrophorus plagiophthalamus under
the control of the parasite sexual stage-specific pfs16 gene promoter. The assay was validated with reference antimalarial
drugs and allowed to quantitatively and simultaneously measure stage-specific
drug effects on parasites at different developmental stages. The optimized
assay, requiring only 48 h incubation with drugs and using a cost-effective
luminogenic substrate, significantly reduces assay cost and time in
comparison to state-of-the-art analogous assays. The assay had a Z′ factor of 0.71 ± 0.03, and it is suitable
for implementation in 96- and 384-well microplate formats. Moreover,
the use of a nonlysing d-luciferin substrate significantly
improved the reliability of the assay and allowed one to perform,
for the first time, P. falciparum bioluminescence
imaging at single-cell level.

Malaria still
represents the
deadliest parasitic infection afflicting humans worldwide, with Plasmodium falciparum causing the most severe form
of the disease. In the goal to globally eliminate malaria, it is increasingly
recognized that antiparasite interventions need to target not only
the pathogenic asexual forms of the parasite but also the Plasmodium developmental stages responsible for transmission
between the human and the Anopheles hosts. Such reinvigorated efforts
include the challenge of revising high throughput (HTS) drug screening
approaches, currently tailored against the Plasmodium replicative asexual blood stages, to identify compounds active against
multiple stages of the malarial parasite life cycle. This is particularly
important at a time where no safe drug is available against P. falciparum transmission stages and reports have
established the emergence of parasite resistance to the frontline
artemisinin drugs.

P. falciparum gametocytes are the
parasite sexual stages responsible for the human-to-mosquito transmission.
These are formed in the human bloodstream where they undergo a 10-day
multistage development showing remarkable morphological1 and physiological2 differences that distinguish early and mature stages. The nonreplicative
nature of these sexual blood stages and their long maturation time
constrained so far the ability of the recently developed gametocyte
assays to sensitively and reliably monitor compound effects on gametocyte
viability, mainly because activity of fluorescent reporters or endogenous
parasite enzymes tends to persist in the unhealthy drug treated gametocytes.3 Current cell-based reporter assays against these
parasite stages generally show suboptimal robustness, require long
assay time and expensive reagents, and do not provide information
about stage-specificity of target drugs.

Bioluminescence (BL)
is the emission of light in living organisms
in which an enzyme, generally called luciferase, catalyzes the oxidation
of a specific substrate, luciferin, with a release of photons in the
visible spectrum. Luciferase genes cloned from different organisms
are used in several bioanalytical applications thanks to peculiar
characteristic of BL reactions such as high quantum yield, high signal-to-noise
ratio, and the possibility to multiplex assays using luciferases emitting
at different wavelengths. As luciferases do not require post-translational
modifications for activity and are not toxic to cells even at high
concentrations, these enzymes have been successfully exploited as
reporters in a variety of ultrasensitive cell-based assays.4,5 The possibility to tune luciferase emission properties such as emission
wavelength and kinetics or thermo- and pH-stability6 via random or site-directed mutagenesis opens the avenue
to significantly improve P. falciparum HTS luciferase assays, so far restricted to the use of the Photinus pyralis wild-type enzyme.7−11 Improvements can be achieved by combining luciferases
emitting at different wavelength under the control of different regulatory
sequences to monitor multiple molecular targets or signaling events,
resulting in increased information from the same cell/well and reduced
assay cost/time. Also, the introduction of a second, constitutively
expressed luciferase in the same cell can provide an internal viability
control to correct the analytical signal, improving assay reliability
and robustness. Moreover, the possibility to monitor in real-time
the BL signal emitted by a single parasite by non invasive BL imaging
offers tremendous potential for clarifying mechanisms of action of
drugs.

In this work, the combination of multicolor bioluminescence
and
use of an optimized luminogenic substrate are reported for the first
time in P. falciparum to quantitatively
and simultaneously assess the viability of parasites at different
developmental stages in a format scalable to HTS and to introduce
single-cell imaging methodology in the study of this parasite.

Experimental
Section
Parasite Cultures and Transfection
The P. falciparum 3D7A line12 was cultured in human 0+ erythrocytes, kindly provided by Prof.
G. Girelli, Dipartimento di Biopatologia Umana, University of Rome
‘‘La Sapienza”, at 5% hematocrit under 5% CO2, 2% O2, 93% N2.13 Cultures were grown in medium containing RPMI 1640 medium
(Gibco) supplemented with 25 mM Hepes, 50 μg/mL hypoxanthine,
0.25 mM NaHCO3, 50 μg/mL gentamicin sulfate, and
10% pooled heat-inactivated 0+ human serum. Ring stage parasites at
3–5% parasitaemia were transfected by electroporation with
80–100 μg of transfection vectors using the following
conditions: voltage, 0.31 kV; capacitance, 960 μF; resistance
to infinity.14 Following transfection,
parasites were maintained in drug free medium for 24 h; at this time,
positive selection was initiated by the addition of 1.2 μg/mL
of blasticidin S to select the parasites stably maintaining the episomal
constructs.

Production of transgenic lines with stably integrated
luciferase cassettes in the pfelo1 locus was attempted
equipping the luciferase cassettes with pfelo1 homology
regions for Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN)-mediated genome editing.15 The episome-containing transgenic parasites
were transfected with ZFN expression plasmid and double selection
started after 24 h by adding 1.2 μg/mL of BSD and 2.5 nM WR99210.
After 7 days of selection, parasites were allowed to recover in the
absence of any drug. Southern blot analysis of the resulting parasites
with pfelo1- and bsd-specific probes
on parental parasites and on parasites containing the episomal plasmids
before and after transfection of the ZFN plasmids revealed, however,
that successful disruption of the pfelo1 locus was
mediated by integration of the entire plasmid via homologous recombination
through the pfelo1 3′ homology region.

Plasmid
Construction
Plasmids containing the myc-tagged
luciferase expression cassettes, equipped with Bbx1 attB sites under
the expression control of the pfs16 regulatory regions
into pCR2.1 vector (Life Technologies), were obtained through a multistep
strategy described in details in the Supporting
Information experimental section. To generate constructs able
to mediate the chromosomal integration of the above luciferase cassettes,
each luciferase expression cassette was excised from its pCR2.1 vector
as a HindIII–HindIII fragment
and cloned into a pDC2-based vector previously modified as described
in detail in the Supporting Information experimental section. The resulting expression plasmids contained
the blasticidine-S-deaminase (BSD) for selection
of transgenic parasites. ZFNs (Sangamo) were engineered for expression
in P. falciparum as described in the Supporting Information experimental section.

Plasmid Copy Number Determination by SYBR-Green
Real-Time PCR
The procedure to determine luciferase cassette
plasmid copy number
in the transgenic parasite lines was based on amplification of sequences
of the bsd selectable marker contained in the episomal
plasmids and of the chromosomal parasite gene pfeba175 as a control for genome numbers. Details of the methodology are
described in the Supporting
Information experimental section.

Southern Blot
Analysis
Procedures for digestion, blotting,
and hybridization of parasite genomic DNA with specific pfelo1 and bsd probes are described in detail in the Supporting Information experimental section.

P. falciparum Gametocyte Drug
Treatments
Drug assays were performed on gametocytes at different
stages of maturation. For early (stage II) gametocytes, induced cultures
were treated 48 h with 50 mM N-acetyl-glucosamine
(NAG) to eliminate asexual stages before drug treatment. Late (IV–V)
stage gametocytes had been NAG-treated 96 h at the onset of gametocytogenesis
and then allowed to mature. Drug treatments were performed in 100
μL final volume in 96-well culture plates at a final hematocrit
of 1%. In these cultures, gametocytemias were routinely ranging from
1% to 2.5% for episomal transgenic parasites and from 2% to 3.5% for
3D7elo1-pfs16-CBG99. Drugs were dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), except for chloroquine, which is soluble in water.
Control samples were treated with DMSO at the highest concentration
present in treated samples, which never exceeded 0.1%.

Immunofluorescence
Analysis
Mixed stage gametocyte
smears were fixed with acetone for 5 min at room temperature, blocked
with PBS/3% BSA for 30 min, and incubated with a rabbit anti-Pfg27
antibody16 (1:500 in 1xPBS 2% BSA) to label
all gametocytes and with a mouse antimyc antibody (ab32, Abcam) (1:200
in 1xPBS 2% BSA). After incubation and washes in 1XPBS, slides were
incubated with a 1:200 dilution of affinity purified, rhodamine-conjugated,
and FITC-conjugate secondary antibody against rabbit and mouse IgG,
respectively.

Luciferase Assays
Comparison of
luciferase activities
from the six episome-expressing transgenic parasites was performed
on stage III gametocytes after Percoll purification.17 Frozen aliquots of equal numbers of gametocytes were resuspended
in ice with 100 μL of PBS just prior to luminometric measurements,
transferred to 96-well white plates, and 100 μL of Britelite
plus Reporter Gene Assay System (PerkinElmer) was added. Total light
outputs were recorded using a Microplate Scintillation and Luminescence
CounterTopCount NXT (PerkinElmer) over a 20-min period in 3-s intervals.
Equivalent samples were also read using a Varioskan Flash multimode
reader (Thermo Fisher). Luminescence measurements were expressed as
signal-to-noise ratio with respect to untransfected 3D7 control parasite
samples.

Commercial substrates Britelite, Neolite, and Steadylite
were from PerkinElmer; One-Glo, Steady-Glo, and Bright-Glo were from
Promega. Frozen pellets of gametocyte expressing CBG99 luciferase
were used to compare bioluminescence emission kinetics. Briefly, 100
μL of the same aliquot of resuspended gametocytes was transferred
to a 96-well white microtiter plate, and 100 μL of each substrate
was added simultaneously with a multichannel pipette. Bioluminescence
emissions were acquired for 45 min with 300 ms integration time using
a Varioskan reader. All samples were tested in triplicate at least
three times. Luciferase assays after drug-treatment experiments were
performed after transferring samples to 96-well white microplates.
Different d-luciferin concentrations and buffer compositions
were tested, and the optimal substrate was 0.5 mM d-luciferin
(final concentration) in citrate buffer 0.1 M, pH 5.5. Substrate (1
mM d-luciferin) was added directly to the samples at a 1:1
ratio, and plates were read within 2 min after addition. Luminescence
measurements were performed as described above.

Bioluminescence
Single-Cell Imaging
Single-cell bioluminescence
imaging was performed on control (DMSO 0.1%) or drug treated gametocytes
(epoxomicin 100 nM, chloroquine 500 nM). After 48 h of incubation,
gametocytes (100 μL at 0.1% HCT) were transferred to a clear
bottom 96-well microplate (ibidi GmbH) coated with Cell-Tak cell and
tissue adhesive (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and allowed to adhere for 30 min at 37 °C. BL imaging
was performed using an inverted microscope (Olympus CK40) connected
to an electron multiplying charge coupled device (EM-CCD) camera (ImagEM-X2,
Hamamatsu). BL images were acquired for 10 min with 40× objective
(UApo, Olympus) after addition of 100 μL of d-luciferin
1 mM. The setup was enclosed in a custom-built dark box to shield
from ambient light. Images were processed with HCImage software (v4.1.5.12,
Hamamatsu) applying a cosmic ray removal option (threshold 10 000)
and brightness/contrast adjusted with normal linear function.

Dual-Luciferase
Gametocyte Assays
The dual-reporter
assays have been performed using CBG99 and CBR expressing parasites
(1% hematocrit), at stage II and stage V of development, mixed in
a 1:10 ratio, respectively, to compensate for the different BL signals
from the two enzymes. Gametocyte mixed populations were seeded in
a 96-well plate and treated for 48 h with 500 nM chloroquine (CQ),
100 nM epoxomicin (Epoxo), or DMSO 0.1% (control). By adding BL, substrate
emissions kinetics were acquired for 15 min (300 ms integration time)
with Varioskan Flash using both F545 (510–580 nm) and F615
(590–640 nm) high transmittance band-pass emission filters.
Raw BL intensities taken from 5 to 10 min were elaborated with Chroma-Luc
Calculator22 to unmix BL emission (corrected
BL) of the green- and red-emitting gametocytes. The mean value of
each corrected BL kinetic is plotted and normalized with respect to
DMSO control.

Results and Discussion
Expression of Green- and
Red-Emitting Luciferases in P. falciparum
A panel of six ATP-dependent
luciferases derived from different bioluminescent species or obtained
by rational mutagenesis were selected according to their enzymatic
properties (Table 1) and expressed for the
first time in the malaria parasite. The repertoire of luciferases
used so far as reporters in malaria parasites is to our knowledge
restricted to the Renilla and the P. pyralis enzymes, with only the latter luciferase
being used in HTS and live imaging applications. Selected luciferases
were the green wild-type Photinus pyralis enzyme (PpyWT18), a red-shifted emission
variant (PpyRE1019), a mutant with green-shifted
emission and increased thermal stability (PpyGRTS18), a red-emitting variant of the firefly Luciola italica (LitRE620), and the green- and red-emitting luciferases from the click beetle Pyrophorus plagiophthalamus (CBG99 and CBR21).

P. falciparum parasites were transfected
with plasmid constructs in which the promoter and the 3′ untranslated
region (UTR) of the gametocyte specific gene pfs16 (Figure S1, Supporting Information) were
used to specifically drive cytoplasmic expression of the above luciferases
from the onset of sexual differentiation (stage I) through the 10-day
long maturation to stage V gametocytes.1 Six transgenic parasite lines were selected for blasticidin resistance,
and real-time PCR experiments determined that plasmid copy number
differed at most 2-fold between these lines (Figure S2, Supporting Information).

In (b) and (c), the highest BL signal is set as 100%.

To identify the most active luciferases in view
of the development
of a dual-color assay, BL emissions were measured from an equal number
of purified stage III gametocytes of the six transgenic lines. The
comparison of the BL signals from the different luciferase-expressing
gametocytes revealed in our hands that the green- and the red-emitting P. plagiophthalamus enzymes provide BL signals significantly
higher than those of the other tested luciferases and display stable
emission kinetics (Figure 1a). Although the
emission spectra of these luciferases show a remarkable overlap, the
distance between the two λmax of approximately 76
nm, combined with the use of appropriate emission filters and a spectral
unmixing algorithm,22 are adequate to successfully
establish a dual-luciferase gametocyte assay in which contribution
of each luciferase can be sensitively and robustly determined. In
addition, these reporters exhibit pH-independent emission and glow-type
emission kinetics, making them the best candidates for the implementation
of the dual-color assay.

Improvement in Luciferase Assay Performance
on the Nonproliferating
Parasite Sexual Stages
The need to identify novel drugs active
against P. falciparum gametocytes recently
prompted much work to establish cell-based assays against such parasite
stages. To improve current assays, the effect of several BL commercial
substrates on the assay analytical performance was evaluated. Emission
kinetics of the gametocyte-expressed CBG99 luciferase in a 45 min
window showed that the highest and most stable BL signal was obtained
using Britelite (Figure 1b). However, as commercial
substrates generally contain additives (luciferase inhibitors, lysing
components, ATP) to enhance and stabilize the bioluminescent signal,
a homemade d-luciferin solution was developed as an alternative
substrate to better reflect the viability of the gametocytes in drug
screening assays, avoiding artifactual BL emission in the treated
cells. Gametocytes expressing the CBG99 or the CBR luciferase were
incubated with Britelite or with a formulation of 0.5 mM d-luciferin dissolved in 0.1 M citrate buffer pH 5.5, optimized to
enter cells in other eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems.23 Although the nonlysing d-luciferin
substrate produced a lower BL signal than Britelite, a stable signal
was obtained from 5 to 15 min after substrate addition, with only
5% variability over 10 min (Figure 1c). To
directly compare the performance of Britelite and d-luciferin
substrates in faithfully monitoring parasite viability exposed to
drug treatment, synchronous unpurified cultures (1% hematocrit, 2%
gametocytemia) of stage II and stage IV gametocytes expressing CBG99
or CBR were exposed for 48 h to a 100 nM concentration of the reference
gametocytocidal drug epoxomicin.24 Results
showed that the decline in luciferase activity in the drug-treated
gametocytes was significantly more pronounced using the d-luciferin substrate than Britelite in both gametocyte stages for
both parasite lines (Figure 2a,b). At 48 h,
with d-luciferin, residual luciferase activity was virtually
absent or <1% in early and late gametocytes, respectively, whereas
with Britelite it was 37 ± 5% in early gametocytes and 57 ±
4% and 72 ± 6%, respectively, in the CBR- and CBG99-late stages.
The robustness of this determination was indicated by a cumulative
assay Z′ factor25 of 0.92 ± 0.09 and was confirmed by the comparable epoxomicin
IC50 values on early and late gametocyte stages obtained
with the commercial and the d-luciferin substrates (12.5
± 0.4 and 14.3 ± 0.6 nM with d-luciferin and Britelite,
respectively, on early and 10.7 ± 0.8 and 10.1 ± 0.5 nM
with d-luciferin and Britelite, respectively, on late stages)
(Figure 2c).

As compared to the assays
traditionally used to identify compounds blocking the multiplication
of the parasite asexual stages, gametocyte assays face the challenge
to reliably measure the ability of compounds to inhibit development
or metabolism of such nonproliferating parasite stages. Low Z′ factors, narrow dynamic ranges, and/or extended
assay times are commonly reported in current gametocyte cell-based
assays measuring gametocyte-expressed fluorescent or luciferase reporters,9,10,26,27 endogenous ATP levels,28 activity of
gametocyte enzymes,3 or redox-dependent
dye fluorescence.29,30 Such suboptimal performances
are largely due to the persistence or slow decay of the above reporters
or signals in the nondividing gametocytes, even when they are affected
by the compound treatment.

The replacement of commonly used
cell-lysing BL substrates with
a formulation of nontoxic, nonlysing d-luciferin substrate
solution resulted in assays where the BL signal relies both on the
expression of the luciferase reporter and, importantly, on the use
of the parasite endogenous ATP, thus reliably reflecting the viability
of the treated and untreated gametocytes. This improvement results
in a cost-effective and less time-consuming protocol able to measure
the drop to background level in gametocyte viability produced by epoxomicin
in only 48 h, whereas as long as 144 h is required in similar assays
based on the gametocyte endogenous lactate dehydrogenase activity.3 Such an improvement was observed not only on
the immature gametocytes but also on the late sexual stages, the ones
freely circulating in the bloodstream ready for uptake by the mosquito
bite, whose apparently quiescent metabolic state makes the identification
of inhibitory compounds particularly challenging.

Single-Cell Bioluminescence
Imaging in Live P.
falciparum Parasites
The possibility to use
a nonlysing d-luciferin substrate to produce a BL signal
from whole living parasites was here exploited to introduce BL imaging
at the single-cell level, unprecedented in malaria parasites, to visualize
live gametocytes of different stages. To perform these experiments,
a parasite line stably expressing the CBG99 luciferase from an integrated
chromosomal locus was produced. A derivative of the P. falciparum 3D7 line was generated in which diagnostic
Southern blot analysis (Figure S3, Supporting
Information) confirmed the integration of the pfs16-CBG99 cassette in the P. falciparum locus encoding the fatty acid elongase-1, pfelo1, dispensable for gametocyte, mosquito, and liver stage development
(Santha Kumar, T. R. and Fidock, D. A., unpublished observations).
Immunofluorescence experiments on gametocytes of this line, named
3D7elo1-pfs16-CBG99, confirmed that the Myc-tagged
luciferase reporter can be readily detected in >80% of the gametocytes
(Figure S4, Supporting Information).

Stage IV gametocytes from the 3D7elo1-pfs16-CBG99
line, immobilized in 96-well plates, were incubated with 0.5 mM d-luciferin and imaged with an optical microscope connected
to an EM-CCD camera. Individual bioluminescent live gametocytes could
be readily imaged and clearly distinguished from uninfected red blood
cells (Figure 3a), representing to our knowledge
the first report of single-cell BL imaging in a protozoan species.
Stage IV gametocytes were then treated for 48 h with 100 nM epoxomicin,
with 500 nM chloroquine, which on such stages has a limited activity
at high concentration, or with the DMSO vehicle. In this experiment,
no bioluminescent cells were detectable in the epoxomicin treated
wells, weak BL signals were seen from gametocytes treated with chloroquine,
whereas strong signals were detected on the metabolically active control
parasites (Figure 3b). The failure to detect
BL signals from morphologically recognizable gametocytes after drug
treatment clearly indicates that the BL imaging signal is diagnostic
of the viability of such cells. These results further confirmed that
the use of a nonlysing d-luciferin substrate greatly improves
the reliability of measuring luciferase reporter activity in the assessment
of parasite viability.

Imaging approaches based on the detection
of transgenic BL cells
are widely used in several biological systems, and have been exploited
also in protozoan unicellular parasites such as P.
falciparum, P. berghei, Trypanosome cruzi, and Leishmania to detect parasite infections in whole
animals. The availability of several luciferase variants whose emissions
are optimized for detection from deep tissues is currently improving
the sensitivity of such approaches to describe the patterns of sequestration
in natural or engrafted mouse tissues by populations of parasites.31−34

Development and Validation of a Dual-Color Stage-Specific Luciferase
Assay
To fully exploit the potential of multicolor bioluminescence,
the selected green and red luciferases were combined to develop a
dual-color assay to quantitatively measure stage-specific effects
of drugs on gametocytes at different developmental stages. Only one
report on the rodent P. berghei parasites
describes a dual luciferase assay exploiting the fact that the two
enzymes require different luminogenic substrates,35 whereas our approach is based on the use of the same BL
substrate and on the ability to quantitatively distinguish the simultaneous
emissions of two reporters at different wavelengths.

gametocytes (60× objective, 10 min acquisition).
Magnification bar is 10 μm. (b) BL imaging of control (0.1%
DMSO) and drug-treated stage IV gametocytes (500 nm chloroquine (CQ)
and 100 nM epoxomicin) (40× objective, 10 min acquisition). Parts
of the photographs showing representative gametocytes in the bright
field and in the BL images are enlarged. Magnification bar is 10 μm.

A sensitive and robust dual-color
assay ideally requires two luciferases
with comparable BL intensities and virtually non-overlapping emission
spectra. Our test of different novel luciferases in P. falciparum was motivated by the fact that the
significant red-shift emission, caused by slight pH and temperature
changes, of the green PpyWT luciferase23 makes this reporter unsuitable for dual-color assays. Although the
firefly red-emitting mutant PpyRE10, with the longest emission wavelength
(λmax = 617 nm) and the narrowest emission spectrum
(half bandwidth of 42 nm), would have represented the ideal red-emitting
partner of the green-emitting CBG luciferase (λmax = 537 nm), the better performance of the CBR luciferase led us to
develop the dual-color BL assay with the P. plagiophthalamus enzymes.

Experiments were preliminarily performed to achieve
an efficient
spectral unmixing of the CBG99 and the CBR luciferase BL emissions.
Green F545 (510–580 nm) and red F615 (590–640 nm) high-transmittance
bandpass emission filters were used for the simultaneous BL acquisition.
The F545 filter allowed acquisition of about 65% of the CBG and only
5% of the CBR luciferase emission, whereas with the F615 filter about
70% of the red luciferase and 16% of the green one were detected (Figure
S5, Supporting Information). Thanks to
a spectral unmixing algorithm (Chroma-Luc calculator,)22 the overlap between BL emissions can be reliably
calculated to achieve a quantitative determination of the specific
BL contributions of the individual luciferases. Dual-color BL assays
were then performed, with the above filter pair, on samples containing
different proportions of CBG99- and CBR-expressing gametocytes. Results
confirmed that the activities of the two luciferases within mixed
gametocyte populations can be accurately quantified from the corrected
green and red light emissions simultaneously recorded from the same
well (Figure S6, Supporting Information).

The ability of the dual-reporter assay to measure stage-specific
drug effects was validated treating for 48 h mixtures of stage II
and of stage V gametocyte cultures with 500 nM chloroquine, virtually
inactive on mature gametocytes,20 or 100
nM epoxomicin, killing all sexual stages.24

The dual assays calculated the specific emissions of the CBG99
and the CBR luciferases, which were respectively produced by early
and by late gametocytes in one experiment (Figure 4a) and by late and by early stages in the reciprocal experiment
(Figure 4b). Results were that neither luciferase
showed any activity after epoxomicin treatment, confirming that this
drug efficiently killed both gametocyte stages. By contrast, in chloroquine-treated
parasites, only a minor decrease in activity was measured for either
the red or the green luciferase when these were produced by the chloroquine-insensitive
mature gametocytes, whereas a dramatic drop in activity of both luciferases
was observed when these were expressed by the early gametocytes. The
dual assay was also performed comparing the d-luciferin and
the Britelite substrates, further supporting that assays using the
nonlysing d-luciferin substrate formulation more faithfully
reflect the differential stage-specific activity of these drugs and
assess parasite viability (Figure 4c). Drugs
killing all gametocyte stages or differentially active against immature
and mature sexual stages validated the ability of the dual-color assay
to quantitatively measure such stage-specific effects. The calculated
assay Z′ factor of 0.71 ± 0.03 indicated
an excellent robustness for scaling up to HTS formats. The use of
a dual-color BL assay to monitor different parasite sexual stages
provides a proof of principle that this approach can be used on other
parasite stages, which has relevant implications for future strategies
in the frame of malaria eradication.

(a) Dual-luciferase assay
with early and mature gametocytes, respectively, expressing the CBG99
(green bar) and the CBR luciferase (red bar). BL intensities were
acquired with a Varioskan luminometer using F545 and F615 optical
filters. Raw BL measurements were spectrally unmixed with the Chroma-Luc
calculator and normalized with respect to DMSO control. (b) Reciprocal
dual-color assay with mature and early stage gametocytes expressing
the CBG99 and the CBR luciferase, respectively. (c) Comparison of
Britelite and d-luciferin performance in an independent dual-color
assay using CBG99 mature stage and CBR early stage gametocytes.

Conclusion
In
this work, we developed a robust, cost-effective, and reliable
dual-color gametocyte assay that exploits, for the first time in malaria,
the potentiality of multicolor bioluminescence. The assay provided
superior analytical performance in comparison to previously reported
assays with the potential of improving current drug screenings in
terms of cost, time, and sensitivity. We envisage that the same approach
could be easily applied to develop new screening assays for identifying
antimalarial drugs targeting different parasite stages. Besides, this
methodology can be used, for instance, to simultaneously compare expression
of stage-specific gene products, measure distinct cellular pathways,
or evaluate the activity of an inducible or treatment-responsive promoter
as compared to a constitutive internal viability control, respectively
driving the expression of the two luciferases in the same parasite.

Moreover, the single-cell BL imaging of the human malaria parasite P. falciparum opens the possibility to monitor in
real-time individual luciferase-expressing parasites in their stage-specific
functional interactions with host tissues and cells and to assess
how distinct cell types affect viability of specific parasite stages
in in vitro and in ex vivo settings.

The concomitant significant development of affordable plate readers
with customizable technical modules dedicated to multiplexing and
BL imaging will greatly facilitate the applicability of the approaches
presented here both in the study of and in the fight against this
deadly parasite.
