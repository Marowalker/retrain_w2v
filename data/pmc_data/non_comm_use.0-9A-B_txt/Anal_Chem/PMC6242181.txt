Lipid
coverage is crucial in comprehensive lipidomics studies challenged
by high diversity in lipid structures and wide dynamic range in lipid
levels. Current state-of-the-art lipidomics technologies are mostly
based on mass spectrometry (MS), including direct-infusion MS, chromatography-MS,
and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) imaging MS,
each with its pros and cons. Due to the need or favorability for measurement
of isomers and isobars, chromatography-MS is preferable for lipid
profiling. The ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution
mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS)-based nontargeted lipidomics approach
and UHPLC-tandem MS (UHPLC-MS/MS)-based targeted approach are two
representative methodological platforms for chromatography-MS. In
the present study, we developed a high coverage pseudotargeted lipidomics
method combining the advantages of nontargeted and targeted lipidomics
approaches. The high coverage of lipids was achieved by integration
of the detected lipids derived from nontargeted UHPLC-HRMS lipidomics
analysis of multiple matrices (e.g., plasma, cell, and tissue) and
the predicted lipids speculated on the basis of the structure and
chromatographic retention behavior of the known lipids. A total of
3377 targeted lipid ion pairs with over 7000 lipid molecular structures
were defined. The pseudotargeted lipidomics method was well validated
with satisfactory analytical characteristics in terms of linearity,
precision, reproducibility, and recovery for lipidomics profiling.
Importantly, it showed better repeatability and higher coverage of
lipids than the nontargeted lipidomics method. The applicability of
the developed pseudotargeted lipidomics method was testified in defining
differential lipids related to diabetes. We believe that comprehensive
lipidomics studies will benefit from the developed high coverage pseudotargeted
lipidomics approach.

==== Body
Lipid plays
a vital role in
cellular barrier, signal conduction, substance transport, and energy
storage.1 It has attracted increasing attention
due to its unique biological significance. Lipidomics is a powerful
analytical tool enabling one to provide detailed characterizations
of lipid alterations in response to internal or external subtle perturbations
in complex biological samples.2 It has
been extensively used in biomarker discovery and mechanism studies
related to cardiovascular disease,3 diabetes,4 cancer,5 and Alzheimer’s
disease (AD).6

Lipids are not only
highly complex in composition and structure
but also widely dynamic in concentration. It was reported that cellular
lipidome contains tens to hundreds of thousands of lipid molecular
species, and their levels fluctuate from attomole to nanomole per
mg of protein.7−9 Lipids are divided into classes and subclasses depending
on the headgroup and the type of linkage between the headgroup and
acyl chains.10 The acyl chains are varied
with different lengths (i.e., different number of carbon atoms), various
degrees of unsaturation, potential branches, etc. These varieties
in headgroup and acyl chain of lipids contribute to the extremely
huge number of individual lipid molecular species,11 making it impossible to fully characterize the whole lipidome
by a single lipidomics approach. To this end, establishing a high
coverage lipidomics method is a suitable compromise.

The mass
spectrometry (MS)-based strategy is predominant for lipidomics
due to its highly enhanced resolution and sensitivity.12 Current state-of-the-art lipidomics technologies
mainly include direct-infusion MS, chromatography-MS, and matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization (MALDI) imaging MS, each with its pros
and cons. Direct-infusion MS-based shotgun lipidomics has been a golden
standard for high-throughput lipid quantitation widely used in many
laboratories.13−15 MALDI imaging MS is powerful for studying the spatial
distribution of lipids in tissues and enables one to provide molecular-histological
maps.16 However, both approaches are not
favorable for detection of isomers and isobars. In practice, MS coupled
with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) is frequently
used for lipid profiling due to the need or favorability for measurement
of lipid isomers and isobars, leading to realizable separation of
isomers and isobars and reduced ion-suppression effects via a chromatographic
separation prior to MS.17,18 The UHPLC-MS-based
lipidomics strategies usually consist of nontargeted and targeted
approaches, each having their own advantages and disadvantages.19

The nontargeted UHPLC-MS lipidomics approach
enables one to cover
many lipid classes as it is unbiased and able to detect “all”
ion features in biological samples. To maximize detection efficiency,
nontargeted lipidomics analyses are usually performed using high resolution
MS (HRMS), such as time-of-flight (TOF), Orbitrap, or Fourier transform
ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) which can provide highly accurate
masses. In these circumstances, especially for Orbitrap and FTICR,
however, MS has to scan many ion features in a very short time. Limited
by their scanning speed, these MS detectors are easily saturated and
the scan time of every consecutive m/z is reduced, resulting in insufficient data-points for lipid peaks
so that the linearity and repeatability are affected.20 Additionally, the data treatment in postacquisition of
nontargeted lipidomics is also tedious. The complex peak assignment
is easily affected by the parameter setting, bringing in bias or errors
in data pretreatment.

Traditional UHPLC-tandem MS (MS/MS)-based
targeted lipidomics analysis
is often executed on triple quadrupole (QQQ) MS with selective MS
scanning modes such as multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), product
ion scanning (PIS), and/or neutral loss scanning (NLS). Such a targeted
method greatly increases the detection sensitivity and is beneficial
for quantification with the benefits of good linearity, good repeatability,
and no complex peak assignment compared with the UHPLC-HRMS nontargeted
lipidomics approach. However, its coverage is limited as it usually
focuses on known lipids.

In this study, we established a high
coverage pseudotargeted lipidomics
method combining the advantages of nontargeted and targeted methods.
First, UHPLC-HRMS nontargeted lipid analyses were performed in full
scan and data dependent MS/MS (ddMS2) modes for multiple-matrix
samples to generate as high coverage lipid profiling as possible.
Second, lipids were assigned on the basis of MS/MS fragments, accurate
masses, and retention time (tR). The unknown
lipids without MS/MS fragments were speculated by comparing their
accurate masses and tR with those of the
known lipids and/or the online Lipid Maps (http://www.lipidmaps.org/).
Third, the undetected but theoretically existing lipids, called extended
lipids, were further studied. tR of the
extended lipids were predicted according to the relationship between tR vs acyl chain carbon number (No.) or acyl
chain double bond No. of the known lipids. Last but not least, lipid
ion pairs were constructed on the basis of the characteristic fragmental
ions and corresponding parent ions of both the detected and predicted
lipids and were monitored in a scheduled MRM mode in a pseudotargeted
lipidomics method. As a proof of applicability, the developed pseudotargeted
lipidomics method was applied in serum differential lipid discovery
related to diabetes, which is highly associated with lipid disturbance
and has been a growing health burden worldwide.21

purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL).

Sample Collection
The bladder cancer cells were cultured
in-house. Mouse brain and liver tissues were collected from Dalian
Medical University in Dalian, China. Plasma samples from 20 healthy
persons were collected from Dalian physical examination center in
Dalian, China. These three sample matrices were specially used for
pseudotargeted method development.

Serum samples from 30 patients
with diabetes and 30 age-matched healthy controls were, respectively,
collected from Suzhou University (Suzhou, China) and Dalian physical
examination center (Dalian, China) and used for method application.
Detailed information was provided in Table S1.

Sample Preparation
A total of ∼106 cells
and ∼10 mg of fresh wet mouse brain and liver tissue
as well as 40 μL of pooled plasma or serum were extracted by
liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) with the MTBE/MeOH/H2O system, respectively. Notably, 30 μL of an internal standard
(IS) mixture containing PC 19:0/19:0 at 6.7 μg/mL, LPC 19:0
at 3.3 μg/mL, PE 17:0/17:0 at 3.3 μg/mL, SM d18:1/12:0

each kind of sample matrix prior to lipid extraction except for the
recovery experiment in method validation, in which the mixture of
lipid ISs at three different levels was added to plasma either before
or after lipid extraction.

Detailed descriptions on lipid extractions
of cells, tissues, plasma, or serum were provided in the Supporting Information.

Nontargeted Lipidomics
Analysis
An ACQUITY Ultra High
Performance LC (UHPLC, Waters, Milford, MA, U.S.A.) system coupled
via an electrospray ion source with a Q Exactive-HF MS system (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, U.S.A.) was used for nontargeted
lipid profiling in both full scan and ddMS2 modes to obtain
lipid information including tR, accurate
masses, and/or MS/MS fragments and so on.

LC conditions and
MS parameters were described in detail in the Supporting Information.

Optimization of Pseudotargeted
Lipidomics Analysis
An ACQUITY UHPLC system coupled with
a hybrid QQQ-linear ion trap
mass spectrometer, Q-Trap 5500 system, with a Turbo Ion Spray source
(AB SCIEX/MDS-Sciex, Concord, ON, Canada) was used for UHPLC/QQQ MRM
MS-based pseudotargeted lipidomics analysis. The LC conditions for
pseudotargeted lipidomics analysis were the same as those in the nontargeted
lipidomics analysis, and the MS parameters were provided in the Supporting Information.

The declustering
potential (DP) and collision energy (CE) of lipid ion pairs were optimized
to obtain the highest response for the mixture of lipid standards.
The precursor ion (Q1), characteristic product ion (Q3), lipid name
(ID), optimized DP, and CE were imported into the MS acquisition method.

Pseudotargeted Lipid Profiling of Serum Samples Related to Diabetes
A pooled quality control (QC) sample was prepared by mixing an
equal aliquot of serum from all of the diabetic and control subjects
enrolled in the method application. Lyophilized lipid extractions
of QC samples were reconstituted in ACN/IPA/H2O (65:30:5,
v/v/v/) containing 5 mM AmAc, and 5 μL was injected into the
LC-MS system. Each was analyzed in triplicates by the UHPLC/QQQ MRM
MS platform in two positive acquisition methods and a negative acquisition
method. After QC sample measurement, lipid ion pair peaks were extracted
from chromatograms to define which lipids existed in the QC samples.
These lipid ion pairs detected in QC samples were used for 2 new UHPLC/QQQ
MRM MS-based pseudotargeted lipidomics methods, respectively, in positive
and negative modes for the subsequent measurement of serum samples
from the diabetic and control subjects.

For the comparison of
the coverage of nontargeted and pseudotargeted lipidomics methods,
six aliquots of QC samples prepared in parallel were, respectively,
analyzed by the established UHPLC/QQQ MRM MS-based pseudotargeted
and UHPLC/LTQ-Orbitrap MS-based nontargeted lipidomics methods. LC
conditions and MS parameters were provided in the Supporting Information.

The validation and application
of the developed pseudotargeted
lipidomics method were performed with UHPLC/QQQ MRM MS. A QC sample
was regularly inserted into the analysis sequence after every eight
samples when analyzing the real biological samples.

Data Processing
and Statistical Analyses
The lipids
detected by the UHPLC/LTQ-Orbitrap MS-based nontargeted lipidomics
method were determined by a commercially available software LipidSearch
(version 4.0) and extraction of ion chromatogram (EIC) of lipids based
on an in-house lipid database. All of the detected lipids were quantified
by Thermo TraceFinder EFS software (version 3.2).

The lipids
monitored by the UHPLC/QQQ MRM MS-based pseudotargeted lipidomics
method were processed with the Analyst software in Explore Mode and
Quantitate Mode (version 1.6, AB SCIEX, Concord, ON, Canada). Normalization
of the lipids by the appropriate lipid ISs for each sample was performed
when necessary.

Statistical analyses in Wilcoxon, Mann–Whitney
Test mode,
and heatmap visualization were conducted by the open-source software
MultiExperiment Viewer (MeV, version 4.9.0, Dana–Farber Cancer
Institute, MA). The statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 and FDR < 0.01. Principal component analysis (PCA)
was performed using SIMCA-p (Umetrics, Umeå, Sweden) software.

Results and Discussion
Comprehensive analysis of lipidome
is of great importance for lipidomics
studies. The present study aimed to establish a high coverage pseudotargeted
lipidomics approach possessing the advantages of both targeted and
nontargeted lipidomics approaches. The workflow of this study is shown
in Figure 1.

Detection of Lipids by Nontargeted Lipidomics Profiling
The Q Exactive-HF MS coupled with a UHPLC system was applied for
nontargeted full scan and ddMS2 acquisition of lipids from
multiple sample matrices to obtain as many lipids as possible. The
representative chromatograms of multiple matrices are shown in Figure 2A (positive mode)
and 2B (negative mode). Manual assignment was
performed after lipid annotation derived from LipidSearch, and 515,
630, and 640 lipids were, respectively, identified in the pooled plasma,
tissue, and cell samples (Figure 2C). Among them, a total of 955 unique lipids could
be obtained with tR, accurate masses,
and/or MS/MS fragments across 19 lipid subclasses.

lipidomics analyses in positive (A) and negative (B) modes. (C) Venn
diagram of qualitative lipid species from nontargeted lipid profiling
of multiple matrices by tR, MS, and MS/MS.
These lipids were from 19 subclasses including 515 lipids in human
plasma, 630 lipids in mouse liver tissue, and 640 lipids in cells.

It needs to be noted that such
MS/MS fragment-based lipid identification
would lose information on lipids which are unable to generate MS/MS
fragments in ddMS2 due to low abundance, structure with
a single acyl chain (i.e., fatty acids), or unsuitable collision energy.
To compensate for such loss, EIC of lipids according to an in-house
lipid database was performed. As expected, a large number of lipids
could be extracted by this way. An extra 401, 492, and 438 lipid features
were, respectively, found in the pooled plasma, tissue, and cell samples
(Table S2, sheets 1 and 2). The identification
of these extracted lipids was further confirmed by their predictively
relative tR values compared to those of
the detected lipids from the same lipid class according to the relationship
between tR and acyl chain carbon No. or
acyl chain double bond No. (Figure S1). Collectively, 508 unique
lipids from three sample matrices were found. After combining the
detected and extracted lipids, a total of 1463 lipids were defined
with tR, accurate masses, and/or characteristic
ions.

The 19 subclasses of the defined 1463 lipids could be
summarized
as fatty acids (FA), ceramides (Cer), hexaglycosylceramides (HexCer),
dihexaglycosylceramides (Hex2Cer), sphingomyelins (SM), lyso-phosphatidylcholines
(LPC), LPC with alkyl substituents (LPC-O), phosphatidylcholines (PC),
alkyl and alkenyl substituent PCs (PC-O), phosphatidylethanolamines
(LPE), LPE with alkyl substituents (LPE-O), phosphatidylethanolamines
(PE), alkyl and alkenyl substituent PEs (PE-O), phosphatidylglycerols
(PG), phosphatidylinositols (PI), phosphatidylserines (PS), diacylglycerols
(DG), triacylglycerols (TG), and cholesterol esters (CE).

Prediction
of Lipid Species
Although UHPLC-HRMS-based
nontargeted lipidomics could provide rich lipid information, the frequently
used HRMS detector (e.g., Orbitrap or FTICR) is easily saturated as
it needs to scan too many ion features in a very short time. Thus,
some lipid features, especially low abundant or the coeluted lipids,
called the undetected but theoretically existing lipids, would be
lost due to the limited MS scanning time per ion feature. It was essential
to get the information on these lipids so that they could be covered
in lipid detection by UHPLC/QQQ MRM MS with higher sensitivity and
selectivity. With this consideration in mind, we extended the coverage
of lipids via further prediction of lipid species based on their structure
and retention relationship within a given lipid class. The prediction
of the extended lipids was made on the basis of the following rules:
for each kind of lipids, (1) the total No. of acyl chain carbon was
defined considering the most frequently detected lipids in biological
samples; (2) single lipid acyl chain carbon No. was considered to
vary from 10 to 26, and acyl chain double bond No. was considered
to vary from 0 to 6 as they are in mammals. It was summarized as (1)
skeletons of sphingolipid: d16:0, d16:1, d18:0, d18:1, d18:2, d20:0,
and d20:1; (2) ether-containing acyl chains: 16:0e, 16:0p, 18:0e,
18:0p, 18:1p, 18:2p, 20:0e, 20:0p, and 20:1p; (3) hydrophobic acyl
chains: 10:0−26:0, 14:1-20:1, 22:1, 24:1, 26:1, 16:2, 17:2,
18:2, 20:2, 22:2, 18:3, 20:3, 22:3, 18:4, 20:4, 22:4, 20:5, 22:5,
22:6. Notably, the predicted lipids were presented with total acyl
carbon No. and total acyl double bond No. When PC lipid species was
taken as an example, the prediction was performed according to (1)
the total No. of two acyl chain carbons varied from 20 to 48; (2)
single acyl chain carbon No. varied from 10 to 26 and single acyl
chain double bond No. varied from 0 to 6. For example, PC (20:X) would be PC (20:0) and PC (48:X) would
include PC (48:0), PC (48:1), PC (48:2), PC (48:3), PC (48:4), PC
(48:5), PC (48:6), PC (48:7), and PC (48:8). In this way, a total
of 1914 lipids were predicted (Table S2, sheets 1 and 2).

Chromatographic tR is a very important parameter for lipid identification. It is well
recognized that lipids from the same class/subclass have similar physicochemical
properties. Therefore, the lipid structure and retention relationship
could be well constructed within a specific class of lipids. When
PC lipid class was taken as an example, Figure S1 displayed the structure and retention relationship constructed
by tR versus acyl chain with different
carbon No. or acyl chain with different double bond No. The tR of PCs with the same double bond No. was linearly
increased with the increase of acyl chain carbon No. (Figure S1A). Furthermore, the tR of PCs with the same carbon No. was linearly decreased
with the increase of acyl chain double bond No. (Figure S1C). These findings facilitated us to predict and
identify more lipids. When PC (29:0) and PC (38:5) were taken as examples,
the predicted tR of PC (29:0) was 5.75
min by the structure and retention relationship equation (black dots
in black circle in Figure S1B). However,
two peaks appeared at tR of 4.88 and 5.75
min in EIC of PC (29:0). The peak eluted at 5.75 min was regarded
as PC (29:0). Similarly, tR of PC (38:5)
was predicted to be 6.48 min (black dots in black circle in Figure S1D). In EIC of PC (38:5), there were
three peaks eluted at tR of 6.48, 6.66,
and 7.47 min, respectively. The peak at 7.47 min was excluded because
of its larger difference as compared to predicted tR (6.48 min) by the structure and retention relationship
equation. Peaks eluted at 6.48 and 6.66 min were regarded as two isomers
of PC (38:5) and presented as PC (38:5)_1 and PC (38:5)_2. Lipid structure
and retention relationships for all of the other classes of lipids
were constructed in the same way (data not shown).

Construction
of the Lipid Ion Pair Database
Lipid ion
pairs were built up on the basis of the detected and predicted lipids
for subsequent MRM. For each lipid class/subclass, lipid ion pairs
were finalized by characteristic product ions with the highest intensity
and the corresponding predominated precursor ions. Thus, the protonated
ion ([M + H]+) was selected as precursor ions for PC, LPC,
PC-O, LPC-O, PE, LPE, PE-O, SM, Cer, HexCer, and Hex2Cer; ammonium
adducted ion ([M + NH4]+) for DG, TG, and CE;
sodium adducted ion ([M + Na]+) for LPE-O; deprotonated
ion ([M – H]−) for FA, PG, PS, and PI. For
example, 184.1 was selected as a characteristic product ion for PC,
LPC, PC-O, LPC-O, and SM; 241.0 for PI; 364.0, 392.0, 420.0, 390.0,
418.0, or 388.0, respectively, for the plasmalogen PE 16:0p_X, PE
18:0p_X, PE 20:0p_X, PE 18:1p_X, PE 20:1p_X, and PE 18:2p_X22 and so on (Table 1). Notably, isomers were not defined in most cases
in the constructed lipid ion pair database. That means one given lipid
ion pair might contain one or more lipid molecules due to many possible
acyl chain combinations caused by different lengths of acyl chains
or different acyl chain double bond No. (Table S3). A total of 3377 lipid ion pairs (Table S2 sheets 3 and 6, 2846 in positive and 531 in negative modes)
with ∼7000 lipid molecular structures across 19 lipid subclasses
were included in the lipid ion pair database.

Construction of the Pseudotargeted
Lipidomics Method
To efficiently monitor these constructed
lipid ion pairs in MRM mode
via the Q-Trap 5500 MS system, some important MS parameters (e.g.,
DP, CE, dwell time, etc.) were optimized. Optimal DP and CE values
for 13 lipid standards in both positive and negative modes are shown
in Table 2.

Other key factors for MRM
acquisition performance are the appropriate
dwell time and sufficient data-point. For our used Q-Trap 5500 MS
system, the two parameters could be calculated by the equation of
targeted time, which was equal to the No. of ion pairs in each detection
window × (dwell time per ion pair + 5 ms). In this MS instrument,
the minimum dwell time of one ion pair was 3 ms, that means ∼10
data-points would be acquired for a peak with 15 s of peak width when
acquiring lipid ion pairs up to 200 in each detection window. Considering
the peak width for most of the lipids was across the range of 0.2–0.3
min, ion pair No. of each detection window was suggested to be lower
than 200. In the present developed method, the detection window was
set as 60 s considering the existing tR shift during the chromatographic separation. Consequently, 2846
MRM transitions in positive mode were split into two MRM methods to
get a combined demand of sensitivity and sufficient data acquisition
rates (Table S2, sheets 4 and 5). To further
ensure the rationality of this split, the input ion pair No. was investigated
at a range from 25 to 400 during 7–8 min at a gradual increment
of 50. It was found that the changes in the sensitivity and stability
of MS could be neglected when the acquired lipid ion pair No. was
lower than 200 in the 60 s detection window, which was in accord with
the calculated result.

Furthermore, the constructed 3377 lipid
ion pairs were monitored
in 3 methods (Table S2, sheets 4, 5, and
7) for a QC serum sample from patients with diabetes and the healthy
controls. The first and second acquisition methods contained 1423
ion pairs in positive mode, and the third acquisition method contained
531 ion pairs in negative mode. Typical chromatograms of the QC sample
are shown in Figure S2. To reduce the random
errors and the false positive results, each of the three acquisition
methods was performed in triplicate. Additionally, the existing criterion
of a lipid ion pair was set as the occurrence of a lipid ion pair
being greater than 2/3 and the absolute value of time deviation being
smaller than 0.5 min compared with the corrected tR achieved by the spiked lipid ISs.23 A total of 823 lipid ion pairs (758 for positive and 65
for negative modes, respectively) met the criteria and were used for
the new UHPLC/QQQ MRM MS-based pseudotargeted lipidomics profiling
to investigate the lipid disorder in diabetes. The typical chromatograms
of the serum sample are shown in Figure 3.

(A) and negative (B) modes based on ion pairs obtained from pooled
QC of serum samples.

Additionally, for a reasonable comparison of the detection
ability
between the pseudotargeted and nontargeted lipidomics methods, the
same QC sample was subjected to a UHPLC/LTQ-Orbitrap MS system for
nontargeted lipid analysis. The result showed that 494 lipids were
identified by UHPLC/LTQ-Orbitrap MS, 329 lipids less than the pseudotargeted
method (Figure 4A).
It could be attributed to (1) MRM analysis having higher selectivity
and sensitivity in favor of detecting low abundant lipids. According
to the LOD of 7 lipid ISs, pseudotargeted QQQ MS improved the absolute
sensitivity of lipids up to 2–105 times compared to nontargeted
HRMS except for LPC 19:0 (data not shown); (2) in the nontargeted
method, the MS detector was easily saturated due to scanning too many
ion features in a very short time, resulting in reduced data-points
that would affect the detection of certain lipids; (3) the MS in MRM
mode was able to separate some isomers (e.g., DGs, Cers, HexCers,
and Hex2Cers in the present study) if different lipid ion pairs could
be used. For example, two peaks were found for DG (34:2) (ion pair:
610.5/313.3, tR = 8.3; 610.5/311.3, tR = 8.3) and Cer (42:3) (ion pair: 646.6/264.3, tR = 9.2; 646.6/262.2, tR = 9.2), and three peaks were found for DG (38:6) (ion pair:
658.5/313.3, tR = 7.7; 658.5/337.3, tR = 7.6; 658.5/339.3, tR = 7.7) in pseudotargeted lipid profiling while only a single
peak was found in nontargeted lipid profiling.

Validation of the Developed Pseudotargeted
Lipidomics Method
Validation of the newly developed pseudotargeted
lipidomics method
was performed by taking plasma as an example. Linearity, precision,
recovery, limit of detection (LOD), and repeatability were assessed.

As shown in Table 3, the linear regression coefficients (R2) were found to be better than 0.99 for all 7 lipid ISs (concentration
range of 7 lipid ISs is provided in Table S4). The LODs were calculated at 3 times of signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio
by the corresponding EICs. The LODs were satisfactory with values
of 0.04–0.5 ng/mL in human plasma. Such low LODs were beneficial
for the detection of the low abundant lipids with very important biological
functions.

The intraday RSDs of
7 lipid ISs ranged from 0.8% to 4.3% with
an average RSD of 2.3%; the interday RSDs of 7 lipid ISs ranged from
2.4% to 16.8% with an average RSD of 9.9%. The RSDs of 2.3% and 9.9%
were acceptable for lipid profiling in complex biological samples,
much lower than the maximum acceptable value of 15%. The low RSD for
the interday precision indicated that the developed pseudotargeted
method was very reproducible and could be applied for a large-scale
sample analysis.

The recoveries of 7 lipid ISs were determined
at the low, medium,
and high concentration levels spiked before or after extraction (n = 3). Except for the Cer d18:1/17:0, the recoveries of
other lipid ISs were in the range of 80–120% (Table 3), acceptable for complex biological
matrices. The lower recoveries of Cer d18:1/17:0 at the low and medium
concentration levels were caused by the limitation of the present
extraction method. Our previous study proved that applying mild alkaline
hydrolysis could improve the extraction of the sphingolipid.24

Repeatability is very important for lipidomics
profiling. If a
lipidomics method varied significantly, small but important changes
between sample groups would be concealed.20 To further evaluate the adequacy of the present pseudotargeted method
for lipidomics analysis, we investigated the repeatability of 494
lipids commonly detected in UHPLC/LTQ-Orbitrap and UHPLC/QQQ MS. RSDs
of peak areas were calculated from 2 replicate injections of triplicate
samples prepared in parallel, and the distribution of RSDs is shown
in Figure 4. It can
be seen from Figure 4B that 51% and 94% of lipids based on UHPLC/QQQ MRM detection showed
RSDs less than 5% and 20%, whereas only 39% and 83% of lipids detected
using UHPLC/LTQ-Orbitrap had RSDs less than 5% and 20%. In Figure 4C, 94% of lipids
based on UHPLC/QQQ MRM showed RSDs less than 10%, whereas only 75%
of lipids detected using UHPLC/LTQ-Orbitrap had RSDs less than 10%.
Thus, 51% and 94% of the UHPLC/QQQ MRM MS-detected lipids had RSDs
less than 5% and 20% in positive mode and 94% of the UHPLC/QQQ MRM
MS-detected lipids had RSDs less than 10% in negative mode, indicating
higher repeatability of this developed method. In addition, RSDs of
the peak areas of the 823 lipids detected by the UHPLC/QQQ MRM MS
method were calculated to evaluate the data quality. The result showed
that 90% of the lipids had RSDs less than 20% in the positive mode
and 98% of the lipids had RSDs less than 10% in the negative mode,
indicating good repeatability of the pseudotargeted lipid profiling
method (Figure S3).

Application of the Pseudotargeted
Lipidomics Method
The applicability of the pseudotargeted
lipidomics method was testified
to discover serum lipid biomarker candidates for patients with diabetes.
The serum lipid extracts of 30 patients with diabetes and 30 healthy
controls were randomly analyzed by the UHPLC/QQQ MRM MS in the positive
and negative modes. QC samples were regularly inserted into the batch
analysis after running every 8 real samples for data quality control.
After peak integration, 591 lipids with the RSD < 20% were selected
for subsequent statistical analyses.

Unsupervised principal
component analysis (PCA) showed that the QC samples were closely clustered
to the center of the samples in the score plot, suggesting the good
repeatability of the UHPLC/QQQ MRM MS method. Meanwhile, we noticed
2 outliers from the two groups, respectively, in PCA score plot. After
checking clinical parameters and lipidome data, we found that 2 outliers
in the control group had higher cholesterol than the mean value and
2 outliers in diabetic group displayed higher TG than the mean value.
We have no scientific reason to exclude them. The patients with diabetes
were distinctly separated from the healthy controls in the PCA score
plot (Figure 5A), indicating
that aberrant lipid metabolism occurred during the pathogenesis and
development of diabetes.

Figure 5 (A) PCA score plot of patients with diabetes,
healthy controls,
and QCs. (B) Heat map of differential lipid molecular species in diabetic
patients as compared to the controls. (C) Relative value of each class
of lipids in serum of patients with diabetes and healthy controls,
analyzed by UHPLC/QQQ MRM MS (*p < 0.05; the data
are expressed as group mean relative value ± SEM).

To find out the most important biomarker candidates
distinguishing
the patients with diabetes from the healthy controls, lipid metabolites
with a p-value <0.05 and FDR < 0.01 were considered
to be of interest. A total of 163 lipid metabolites across 15 lipid
subclasses met the criteria (Table S5).
The heat map of these significantly changed lipid metabolites is shown
in Figure 5B.

To explore changes in lipid pool, the total contents of each lipid
class/subclass were calculated for each of the samples. The student t test was performed for the patients diabetes versus the
healthy controls, and a p-value <0.05 was considered
to be of biological significance. The result is shown in Figure 5C. It can be observed
that TGs, DGs, PEs, and LPEs were significantly increased, while HexCers,
PE-Os, PC-Os, and LPC-Os were significantly decreased in patients
with diabetes as compared to the healthy controls.

DGs are not
only the functional components of membrane bilayers
but also signaling molecules. It was reported that signaling of DG
was mainly mediated by the recruitment and activation of the protein
kinase C (PKC) isoforms to specific, membrane embedded DA species.25 PKC isoform nPKCθ and nPKCε could
inhibit insulin signaling and ultimately glucose uptake.26−28 The increased DGs in patients with diabetes might indicate that
PKC in diabetes was activated, which could influence the occurrence
and development of diabetes.

Concerning the alteration of serum
TGs, an interesting finding
was that most of the polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing TGs were
increased significantly in diabetes. Several prospective studies have
identified dyslipidemia, particularly hypertriglyceridemia, as an
independent predictor of incident type 2 diabetes mellitus.29,30 The increasing proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acid in TGs was
attributed to insulin-mediated inhibition of hormone sensitive lipase:
a decrease in saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid released from
adipose tissue increased the relative amount of polyunsaturated fatty
acids available to the liver for TGs assembly.31,32

Ether-containing glycerophospholipids, especially plasmalogens,
have many roles in cellular function and are important components
of the cell plasma membrane.33−35 It was reported that reduced
plasmalogen content could be caused by peroxisomal dysfunction, oxidative
stress, or phospholipase (particularly phospholipase A2) activation.36 In this study, PE-O lipids were significantly
reduced while LPEs significantly increased in diabetes (Figure 5C). These findings might indicate
that oxidative stress increased in diabetes, leading to the development
of diabetes by damaging the islet β cells and reducing the sensitivity
of peripheral tissues to insulin.37 This
finding has been confirmed by Wang et al., who measured the indicator
of oxidative states of 4-hydroxylalkenal.38 Wacker et al. have also verified the finding by measuring chlorinated
lipids.39

Collectively, our results
demonstrate that the UHPLC/QQQ MRM MS-based
pseudotargeted lipidomics method possesses a high coverage and good
characteristics of linearity, precision, recovery, and repeatability.
It is very promising for discovering potential biomarkers of disease.

Conclusions
In the present study, a novel strategy for high
coverage of lipid
profiling was implemented, combining the advantages of both nontargeted
and targeted lipidomics approaches. A total of 3377 ion pairs covering
∼7000 lipid molecules were derived from nontargeted UHPLC-full
scan/ddMS2 lipid analysis of multiple biological matrices
and lipid predictions according to the lipid structure and retention
relationship within a given lipid class. To our knowledge, this is
the first study using this strategy for high coverage of lipid profiling.
It enabled the detection of 823 lipids from 40 μL of serum,
displaying higher lipid coverage and better repeatability than the
UHPLC/LTQ-Orbitrap MS-based nontargeted lipidomics method. Data processing
was simple, and the efficiency was greatly improved. It showed high
potential for defining the characteristics of lipids in complex biological
matrices. Future studies will extend the method to biological matrices
from different diseases. We firmly believe that the developed high
coverage UHPLC/QQQ MRM MS-based pseudotargeted method will be beneficial
for the lipidomics study.
