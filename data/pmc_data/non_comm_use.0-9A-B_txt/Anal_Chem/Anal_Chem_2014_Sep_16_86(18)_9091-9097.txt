Competitive
binding assays utilizing concanavalin A (ConA) have
the potential to be the basis of improved continuous glucose monitoring
devices. However, the efficacy and lifetime of these assays have been
limited, in part, by ConA’s instability due to its thermal
denaturation in the physiological environment (37 °C, pH 7.4,
0.15 M NaCl) and its electrostatic interaction with charged molecules
or surfaces. These undesirable interactions change the constitution
of the assay and the kinetics of its behavior over time, resulting
in an unstable glucose response. In this work, poly(ethylene glycol)
(PEG) chains are covalently attached to lysine groups on the surface
of ConA (i.e., PEGylation) in an attempt to improve its stability
in these environments. Dynamic light scattering measurements indicate
that PEGylation significantly improved ConA’s thermal stability
at 37 °C, remaining stable for at least 30 days. Furthermore,
after PEGylation, ConA’s binding affinity to the fluorescent
competing ligand previously designed for the assay was not significantly
affected and remained at ∼5.4 × 106 M–1 even after incubation at 37 °C for 30 days. Moreover, PEGylated
ConA maintained the ability to track glucose concentrations when implemented
within a competitive binding assay system. Finally, PEGylation showed
a reduction in electrostatic-induced aggregation of ConA with poly(allylamine),
a positively charged polymer, by shielding ConA’s charges.
These results indicate that PEGylated ConA can overcome the instability
issues from thermal denaturation and nonspecific electrostatic binding
while maintaining the required sugar-binding characteristics. Therefore,
the PEGylation of ConA can overcome major hurdles for ConA-based glucose
sensing assays to be used for long-term continuous monitoring applications in vivo.

==== Body
Diabetes
mellitus disrupts the
regulation of the body’s blood glucose levels. It currently
affects ∼29.1 million diagnosed and undiagnosed individuals
in the United States and ∼347 million worldwide.1,2 Poorly regulated blood glucose levels can lead to serious secondary
complications such as kidney failure, heart disease, and blindness.3 In order to minimize these complications, patients
must self-regulate their blood glucose concentrations. This typically
involves taking routine blood glucose measurements and making the
necessary adjustments to their diet, exercise, and/or medication to
maintain euglycemia. In recent years, continuous glucose monitoring
(CGM) has been identified as a means to improve diabetes management.
Current commercially available CGM devices require frequent calibrations
and must be replaced after 3–7 days.4 Therefore, many research efforts are underway in an attempt to generate
improved CGM devices with longer lifetimes and fewer calibrations.
One such approach is based on a fluorescent affinity sensor comprised
of concanavalin A (ConA).5−9

ConA, a lectin extracted from the jack bean, is a tetramer
at physiological
pH (7.4) comprised of four identical monomeric subunits (MW ∼
25 kDa).10,11 Each monomer contains an independent carbohydrate
binding site, for which glucose and mannose monosaccharides can bind.12 It has been shown that ConA has the ability
to reversibly bind to glucose with an affinity of ∼400 M–1.13 This affinity allows
the capability for ConA to track physiologically relevant glucose
concentrations. Therefore, ConA is an attractive receptor to be used
in a next generation nonenzymatic sensor.

The first noted ConA-based
competitive binding assay for glucose
sensing was developed by Schultz et al. and employed 70 kDa fluorescein-isothiocyanate
dextran (FITC-dextran) as the competing ligand.14,15 This scheme used a semipermeable membrane to contain the sensing
assay and allowed glucose to equilibrate with the external environment.
Changing glucose concentrations within the membrane changed the equilibrium
binding of assay components, which was transduced into a fluorescent
signal that could be measured. Since this introduction, many different
variations of the sensing assay have been designed and studied using
the same scheme due to its tremendous potential for use in CGM devices.16−22 Certain assay variations have immobilized ConA to a solid-phase
(microdialysis membranes, beads, etc.) while leaving the competing
ligand in free solution.23 This approach
has been shown to track glucose concentrations in the body for up
to 16 days.24 Other variations have left
both assay components in free solution. Practically, this approach
allows the sensor to be developed modularly, where the assay can be
developed without requiring the semipermeable membrane. In addition,
this approach can potentially minimize the equilibration time to changing
glucose concentrations. However, the solution-based approach has shown
problems with stability which is a major obstacle in the advancement
of the technology for such embodiments.25

This instability has partly been due to the specific sugar-dependent
aggregation seen in assays that pair traditional high-affinity competing
ligands (e.g., dextran, glycosylated dendrimer, etc.) with ConA in
free solution.26,27 Since ConA is a tetramer, it
presents multiple binding sites that can aggregate with these multivalent
competing ligands over time. The resulting lattice-type aggregate
eventually precipitates out of solution and requires a significantly
higher concentration of glucose to break it apart. This type of instability
has recently been addressed by the introduction of a new type of fluorescent
competing ligand. This ligand avoids this specific aggregation by
presenting a single high affinity moiety for ConA to bind.28 As a result, the ligand does not present additional
residues for ConA to bind once it is already bound, allowing for the
assay to remain stable in free solution.

Another aspect of the
original assay’s instability is associated
with ConA’s thermal denaturation at physiological temperatures.
Since ConA is a protein, it is prone to unfolding, aggregation, and
degradation.29,30 At elevated temperatures, the
associated energy can increase the likelihood that the protein unfolds.
This unfolding can expose the hydrophobic residues, typically found
in the interior of the protein, to the solvent. These residues can
interact with neighboring exposed hydrophobic groups leading to aggregation.
This aggregation is believed to be irreversible and diminishes the
solubility and activity of the protein.18,31 Vetri et al.
have reported that ConA undergoes this denaturation-induced aggregation
at ∼40 °C.32 Changes in ConA’s
activity due to aggregation can significantly impact the glucose response
of the assay by changing the concentration of active binding sites
for which glucose can bind. Therefore, to maximize the in
vivo lifetime of a ConA-based glucose assay, it is desirable
to minimize the rate of ConA’s thermal denaturation at physiologically
relevant temperatures. The immobilization of ConA to the solid-phase
presumably maintains the assay stability by either stabilizing ConA
and/or preventing unfolded ConA from aggregating with itself.

In addition to this thermal denaturation, ConA has a tendency to
adhere to positively charged surfaces. This electrostatic interaction
is due to ConA’s overall negative charge under physiological
conditions. This is due to its isoelectric point (pI) of ∼5, which is defined as the pH at which a particular
molecule carries no net electrical charge.33 This adhesion of ConA to surfaces or molecules can change the concentration
and the activity of the receptor in solution. This becomes important
when considering encapsulation of the assay for the purpose of in vivo implantation. Layer-by-layer (LbL) microcapsules
are attractive semipermeable candidates that can be tuned to effectively
encapsulate the assay while allowing for the rapid equilibration of
smaller analytes with its exterior environment (e.g., glucose). However,
proteins have shown the tendency to electrostatically attach to the
capsule’s inner charged surface.34 If ConA behaves in a similar manner, the functionality of the assays
would be affected as the availability of active receptors within the
capsules may decrease. Thus, if LbL microcapsules are to be used,
it would be preferable for ConA to avoid undergoing electrostatic
interactions with the capsule.4

PEGylation
is the process by which PEG chains are covalently attached
to various molecules and surfaces to improve their stability, solubility,
and biocompatibility.35,36 The enhanced stability and solubility
of a molecule (e.g., protein) via PEG chains is believed to be a result
of a hydration barrier created by the grafted hydrophilic chains.37 In addition, the rapid mobility of the chains
provides a steric hindrance effect that may aid in the reduction of
particle–particle interaction depending on the chain length.38 These characteristics of PEG are believed to
aid in the reduction of protein aggregation and precipitation. Groups
such as Rajan et al., Rodriguez-Martinez et al., and Veronese et al.
have shown evidence of this with the attachment of different molecular
weight PEG chains to protein molecules such as α-chymotrypsin
and a hematopoietic cytokines.39−41 Furthermore, Wu et al. have shown
an additional advantage of the chains in the role of masking surface
charges to minimize nonspecific electrostatic binding of proteins
or cells to their imaging contrast agent.42

These characteristics have allowed for PEGylation to be used
to
improve drug delivery systems, reduce protein adhesion, and increase
molecular solubility in free solution. In terms of ConA, Kim and Park
have shown that the conjugation of PEG chains to ConA increased its
solubility at room temperature (22 °C) for the purpose of designing
a hydrogel comprised of immobilized ConA for insulin delivery.43,44 Herein, we investigate the use of PEGylation to minimize the aforementioned
nonspecific interactions of ConA to improve the associated stability
of the solution-based glucose monitoring approach in a physiologically
relevant environment. We show that PEGylation decreases the rate of
ConA aggregation with itself at body temperature without significantly
affecting the binding affinity to the fluorescent competing ligand
and its ability to track physiological glucose concentrations. We
also observe that PEGylation reduces the electrostatic interactions
between the lectin and positively charged surfaces which may prove
to be useful for microencapsulation of the assay for in vivo glucose sensing.

Experimental Section
Materials
ConA
Type IV lyophilized powder, manganese(II)
chloride (MnCl2), Trizma hydrochloride (Trizma-HCl), sodium
bicarbonate, poly(allylamine) (PAH+), and methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside (MaM) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis,
MO). Dextrose (d-glucose) was purchased from Fisher Scientific
(Hampton, New Hampshire). Methoxyl-poly(ethylene glycol)-N-hydroxylsuccinimide-succinimidyl carbonate (mPEG-NHS (SC), 5 kDa)
was purchased from Nanocs (New York, NY). Calcium chloride dihydrates
(CaCl2) and sodium chloride (NaCl) were purchased from
Mallinckrodt Chemical Inc. (St. Louis, MO) and J.T. Baker (Center
Valley, PA), respectively. Acetone was obtained from Avantor Materials
(Center Valley, PA). Fluorescamine was obtained from Life Technologies
(Grand Island, NY). The competing ligand, amino-pyrene trisulfonate
mannotetraose (APTS-MT), was synthesized with Dr. Vigh at Texas A&M
University as previously described.28 A
0.2 μm syringe filter from VWR (Radnor, PA) was used to filter
all solutions before each experiment. All buffers were made using
deionized water (DI H2O) with a resistance of ∼18
MΩ cm, and experiments were performed in TRIS buffer (pH 7.4,
10 mM Trizma-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM MnCl2, and 1 mM CaCl2) or 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5 and 0.15 M NaCl).

PEGylation of ConA
ConA was PEGylated with 5 kDa mPEG-NHS
(SC), a primary amine reactive polymer that contains a succinimidyl
carbonate linker. Briefly, ConA was dissolved in sodium bicarbonate
buffer (10 mg mL–1). The solution’s peak
absorbance at ∼280 nm was measured using a Hitachi U-4100 UV–vis-NIR
spectrophotometer (Hitachi High Technologies American Inc., U.S.)
to determine the concentration of the solution using an extinction
coefficient of 118 560 M–1 cm–1 based on the E1% of 11.4 and MW of ∼104
kDa.45 A highly concentrated aliquot of
MaM was added to the ConA solution for a final MaM concentration of
1.9 mg mL–1 in an attempt to protect the activity
of the binding sites of ConA during the reaction. Next, mPEG-NHS (SC)
was added at a molar ratio of 16:1 to the ConA monomer. At 22 °C,
this solution was mixed on a rotating wheel for 6 h and then allowed
to continue reacting for 18 h without mixing. The solution was subsequently
separated into two dialysis tubes (MWCO 20 kDa). One tube was dialyzed
against sodium bicarbonate buffer for PEGylation characterization
with fluorescamine, while the remaining solution was dialyzed against
TRIS buffer for all other experiments. Following dialysis, absorption
measurements were again performed to determine the final PEGylated
ConA concentrations, using the same molar extinction coefficient as
unmodified ConA.

PEGylation Characterization
The
average degree of PEGylation
was estimated using fluorescamine, as it is a useful tool to track
the concentration of primary amines within a solution.46 Fluorescamine becomes fluorescent after reacting
with primary amines, and changes in fluorescence intensity can be
descriptive of the makeup of the solution. This was used to compare
identical concentrations of unmodified and PEGylated ConA to determine
their relative concentrations of primary amines. This difference is
related to the approximate number of mPEG chains grafted per ConA
monomer.

Briefly, a range of concentrations of unmodified ConA
and PEGylated ConA (0–2.5 μM) were prepared in sodium
bicarbonate buffer (1.5 mL). Then, 500 μL of fluorescamine (0.3
mg mL–1 in acetone) was added to each solution and
mixed well. Subsequently, 100 μL of each solution was added
to a standard black 96-well microplate. After 5 min, the fluorescence
intensity of each solution was measured using a TECAN Infinite 200
PRO microplate reader (Tecan Group Ltd., Männedorf, Switzerland)
at λex = 390 nm and λem = 475 nm.
These fluorescence intensities were plotted against the corresponding
ConA concentrations, and the linear regression was performed to obtain
the slopes, mmPEGConA and mConA. These slopes were used in eq 1 to estimate the average degree of PEGylation (DP), similar to Wen
et al.47 1  

This
equation was utilized under the assumptions that fluorescamine
could originally interact with each of the primary amines on unmodified
ConA and that it could interact with each of the primary amines that
remained on PEGylated ConA. Therefore, the differences in the fluorescence
intensities are assumed to be solely due to the decrease in the primary
amine concentration resulting from the conjugated PEG chains.

Thermal
Stability
The thermal denaturation of unmodified
and PEGylated ConA in free solution was tracked by monitoring the
aggregation in a physiologically relevant buffer with dynamic light
scattering (DLS). In sealed disposable polystyrene cuvettes (1 cm
path length), solutions of unmodified and PEGylated ConA (10 μM
each) were prepared in triplicate in TRIS buffer. The cuvettes were
incubated at 37 °C. Over the course of 30 days, measurements
were taken at seven different time points (days 0, 1, 2, 4, 9, 16,
and 30) with resuspension of the particles via aspiration before each
measurement. A Malvern Nano Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Worcestershire,
U.K.) was used to measure the average particle diameter (Z-average) as well as the polydispersity index (PDI) of the particles
within each solution.

Binding Affinity
The binding affinity
of unmodified
and PEGylated ConA to the rationally designed fluorescent competing
ligand, APTS-MT, was evaluated using fluorescence anisotropy. In the
wells of a standard black 96-well microplate, solutions were prepared
with a fixed concentration of APTS-MT (100 nM) and a range of concentrations
of either unmodified or PEGylated ConA (4 nM to 10 μM). Solutions
were prepared in TRIS buffer, and each well had a final volume of
100 μL. The appropriate controls (TRIS buffer and 100 nM APTS-MT)
were also added to separate microplate wells for baseline correction
purposes. Time was then given for all solutions to reach equilibrium
(∼10 min) at 22 °C, and a TECAN Infinite F200 microplate
reader fitted with polarizers was used to measure the steady-state
fluorescence anisotropy of each solution (λex = 483
nm; λem = 540 nm). The affinity was determined by
plotting the average anisotropy as a function of the tetrameric ConA
concentration on a logarithmic scale and fitting the data with a Boltzmann
curve.

To determine the stability of this binding in a physiologically
relevant environment, the stock solution of PEGylated ConA was then
stored at 37 °C for 30 days. Portions of this stock solution
were withdrawn at various time points during this period (days 1,
2, 4, 9, 16, and 30) and tested via fluorescence anisotropy in the
same manner.

Glucose Response
PEGylated ConA
was tested using a
fluorescence anisotropy assay comprised of 200 nM APTS-MT (the competing
ligand) and 1 μM PEGylated ConA to determine its effectiveness
in tracking physiological glucose concentrations. Various concentrations
of d-glucose (0 to ∼800 mg dL–1)
were prepared in TRIS buffer and verified using a YSI 2300 Stat Plus
biochemistry analyzer. A stock assay containing 2 μM mPEG-ConA
and 400 nM APTS-MT was prepared in TRIS buffer. In a standard black
96-well microplate, 50 μL of the assay and 50 μL of the
appropriate glucose concentrations were added to separate wells and
a mixed well. This created wells containing a final assay concentration
of 200 nM APTS-MT and 1 μM PEGylated ConA with glucose concentrations
ranging from 0 to ∼400 mg dL–1. Like before,
the appropriate controls (TRIS buffer and 200 nM APTS-MT) were also
added to separate microplate wells for baseline correction purposes.
After time was given for the solutions to equilibrate (∼10
min) at 22 °C, the steady-state anisotropy of each solution was
measured with the TECAN Infinite F200 microplate reader.

Nonspecific
Adsorption
Light scatter can be used to
investigate the interaction of macromolecules in free solution, including
those containing proteins. For example, Park et al. have used this
method to study the electrostatic interaction between different biological
proteins (i.e., BSA, RNase, and lyzozymes) and polyelectrolytes (i.e.,
PSS, PVS, etc.) via turbidity measurements at 420 nm.48 This turbidity is related to the amount of aggregation
within the various samples and is indicative of the specific and/or
nonspecific binding between molecules.

In a similar manner,
the electrostatic interactions of PAH+ (a common polyelectrolyte
used in LbL) with unmodified and PEGylated ConA was measured in this
study. In separate centrifuge tubes, each of the following solutions
was prepared in triplicate in TRIS buffer at 22 °C: PAH+ with ConA, PAH+ with PEGylated ConA, ConA, PEGylated
ConA, and PAH+. Each individual component in each solution
was prepared at 10 μM for comparison. Immediately after preparation,
100 μL of each sample was extracted and added to a standard
UV–vis 96-well microplate. The turbidity of each solution was
then measured at 400 nm using a TECAN Infinite 200 PRO microplate
reader. These measurements were also performed at 30 min, 1 h, 24
h, and 48 h.

Results and Discussion
Degree of PEGylation
Each ConA monomer contains 13
primary amines that can potentially be PEGylated (12 lysine residues
and the N-terminus).43 Figure 1 shows that fluorescamine’s fluorescence
intensity was consistently lower in solutions of PEGylated ConA than
it was for unmodified ConA at the same concentration. This indicates
that the presence of the mPEG chains decreased the interaction between
fluorescamine and the primary amines on the PEGylated ConA. Equation 1 estimates an average of ∼5.36 mPEG chains
grafted per ConA monomer. Assuming a Poisson distribution, this degree
of PEGylation would mean that 99.9% of ConA tetramers have 8 or more
mPEG chains per tetramer. While the average number of mPEG chains
grafted per ConA could be lower than the estimated value from eq 1, the PEGylated ConA is expected to be sufficiently
modified for the purpose of this study.

Figure 1 Decrease in the fluorescence
intensity of fluorescamine in the
presence of PEGylated ConA compared to unmodified ConA, indicating
the degree of PEGylation.

Thermal Stability
The thermal stability of unmodified
and PEGylated ConA was investigated by tracking the time dependent
aggregation of the protein within the solutions at 37 °C. Per
Figure 2, the average particle size in the
unmodified ConA solution displayed an initial (i.e., day 0) diameter
of 8 ± 0.03 nm, consistent with previous reports for the hydrodynamic
diameter of unmodified tetrameric ConA.49 The average particle size in the PEGylated ConA solution displayed
a higher initial diameter of 30 ± 0.22 nm (Figure 2), due to the increase in the aforementioned hydration barrier
associated with multiple mPEG chains.

Figure 2 Z-average particle size
of unmodified ConA compared
to PEGylated ConA (top) in response to incubation at 37 °C, over
the course of 30 days. In the bottom panel, PEGylated ConA is rescaled
to show its average particle size. The error bars show the standard
deviation for three different runs.

After 24 h, the average diameter of particles in the unmodified
ConA solution increased to over 400 nm. After 30 days at 37 °C,
the average diameter of particles in the solution of unmodified ConA
increased to ∼1.8 μm (Figure 2), indicating aggregation of the ConA molecules. The slight decrease
in particle size for unmodified ConA between day 16 and day 30 is
believed to be due to the precipitation of the larger aggregates during
the measurements. Overall, this type of aggregation clearly indicates
that unmodified ConA is thermally unstable in this environment.

In contrast, Figure 2 shows that the average
particle size in the PEGylated ConA solution remained relatively constant
at ∼30–38 nm over 30 days at 37 °C. This indicates
that PEGylated ConA displays negligible thermally induced aggregation
and suggests that ConA’s thermal stability has indeed been
improved via this degree of PEGylation. The slight increase in standard
error of the average size of PEGylated ConA could be due to the small
percentage of ConA molecules that displays either low levels of PEGylation
or no PEGylation at all. Without sufficient PEGylation, this population
is expected to display properties similar to that of unmodified ConA.
Strategies could potentially be employed to remove this small percentage
prior to the use of PEGylated ConA in a sensor.

The polydispersity
of the particle sizes within a solution can
also be used to describe that solution. For instance, aggregation
is expected to produce a large distribution of particle sizes, which
would display a high level of polydispersity. For the DLS measurements
reported here, the polydispersity index (PDI) indicates the level
of polydispersity and ranges from 0 (low dispersity) to 1 (completely
disperse).

Figure 3 shows the comparison
of time-dependent
PDI of the solutions for unmodified and PEGylated ConA at 37 °C.
Initially, the PDI of the PEGylated ConA is slightly higher than the
unmodified ConA. This is presumably due to the range of degrees of
PEGylation that is to be expected with a Poisson distribution. However,
over the course of the 30 days of this experiment, the PDI of the
unmodified ConA solution increased from 0.2 to 0.87 implying that
the solutions of unmodified ConA became increasingly heterogeneous
as the formation of aggregates increased (Figure 3). In comparison, Figure 3 shows that
PEGylated ConA remained relatively homogeneous in solution over the
same time period. This result confirms what was observed in Figure 2; the average particle size of PEGylated ConA remains
relatively constant and does not aggregate. These characteristics
suggest that this degree of PEGylation improves the thermal stability
of ConA at physiological conditions. It is important to note that
this improved stability could be due to an inhibition of the aggregation
of unfolded ConA via steric hindrance, an improved conformational
stability of ConA, or a combination thereof.

Figure 3 Average PDI of unmodified
and PEGylated ConA at 37 °C for
30 days. The error bars show the standard deviation for three different
runs.

Binding Affinity
While PEGylation does increase the thermal
stability of ConA, the PEGylated protein must maintain its binding
capability to be functional in a competitive binding assay. The degree
to which ConA’s binding is affected by PEGylation is likely
to be dependent on the chain length and the number of chains grafted.
However, for a given degree of PEGylation, it is expected to have
a greater effect on the binding of the competing ligand than that
of glucose due to relative size. Therefore, ConA’s binding
to the fluorescent competing ligand (APTS-MT) of the competitive binding
assay was investigated. For PEGylated ConA to be used in a competitive
binding assay and optimally track physiological glucose concentrations,
an affinity of 105 to 107 M–1 to the competing ligand is required.28 Binding studies would need to be performed if a different competing
ligand or degree of PEGylation were to be used. In addition, if a
traditional competing ligand is used, additional experiments should
be performed to determine whether sugar-dependent aggregation is occurring.
This is because PEGylation of ConA could avoid the aggregation with
such ligands through steric hindrance effects.

Herein, the binding
affinity (Ka) of APTS-MT to unmodified
and PEGylated ConA was evaluated using fluorescence anisotropy. Fluorescence
anisotropy is a useful tool that can provide information about protein–ligand
interactions. Briefly, polarized light is used to selectively excite
a portion of the fluorescent ligand within solution. The average rotational
diffusion of the molecules at equilibrium can be tracked with the
polarization of the fluorescence. This fluorescence polarization/anisotropy
increases as the binding of the fluorescent ligand to the desired
protein increases.50 The parallel and perpendicular
components of the fluorescent emission can be measured, and the fluorescence
anisotropy can be calculated with eq 2.51 2  

In this equation, r is the anisotropy, G is the correction
factor due to the instrument’s
sensitivity or biased to one polarizer over the other, and Ivv and Ivh are the
vertically and horizontally polarized fluorescence intensities, respectively.
The dissociation constant (Kd) was determined
from a plot of the anisotropy as a function of varying ConA concentration
using a Boltzmann curve fit.

The association constants (Ka) for
unmodified and PEGylated ConA were ∼5.7 ± 0.37 ×
106 M–1 and ∼5.4 ± 0.37 ×
106 M–1, respectively. Therefore, PEGylation
did not significantly affect the binding affinity of ConA to the competing
ligand. Moreover, PEGylated ConA’s affinity falls within the
range necessary for this assay to be optimized across physiological
glucose concentrations.

In addition, the capability of PEGylated
ConA to maintain its binding
affinity after incubation at 37 °C was evaluated. Since anisotropy
is sensitive to scatter, measurements of unmodified ConA were not
possible due to the large aggregate formation similar to those observed
during the thermal studies.

Figure 4 indicates
that the binding affinity
of PEGylated ConA to the competing ligand remained stable at ∼5.4
± 0.5 × 106 M–1 over 30 days.
The slight fluctuations in affinity may be related to pipet error
during mixing and sample transfer from the cuvette to the microplate.
This result, along with its thermal stability in free solution, suggests
that the activity of ConA can be maintained via PEGylation which may
allow for long-term functionality of a ConA-based sensor. Furthermore,
because ConA’s binding is due to its folded structure, the
long-term binding stability suggests that the protein maintains its
functional conformation over time. Therefore, we expect that PEGylation
is most likely enhancing ConA’s conformational stability in
addition to any steric-hindrance effects that it also imparts.

Figure 4 Stability of
the binding affinity of PEGylated ConA to the competing
ligand. The error bars show the standard deviation for three different
runs.

Glucose Response
PEGylated ConA was expected to maintain
its response to glucose because the binding of APTS-MT was not hindered
by the presence of the PEG chains (Figure 4) and glucose (MW ∼180 Da) is smaller than APTS-MT (MW ∼1
kDa). To verify this, fluorescence anisotropy was used to track the
behavior of an assay comprised of PEGylated ConA and APTS-MT in the
presence of varying concentrations of glucose (Figure 5). This displays a characteristic competitive binding curve,
where the anisotropy decreases in response to increasing glucose concentrations.
This indicates that the PEGylation of ConA does not inhibit its ability
to track physiological glucose concentrations in the competitive binding
assay.

ConA (1 μM PEGylated ConA and 200 nM APTS-MT). Solid line: best
fit to experimental data using the competitive binding equation. The
error bars show the standard deviation for three different runs.

Nonspecific Adsorption
The effect that PEGylation had
on the electrostatic interactions between ConA and positively charged
molecules was studied using PAH+. Unmodified and PEGylated
ConA were allowed to interact with PAH+ in free solution,
and turbidity measurements at 400 nm were used to evaluate aggregation.
ConA absorbs ultraviolet light with a peak at ∼280 nm and absorbs
a negligible amount of light above ∼320 nm. Therefore, any
extinction of the incident light higher than 320 nm is assumed to
be scattered light that is associated with aggregate formation within
the solution.

The electrostatic-induced aggregation between
the negatively charged unmodified ConA and the positively charged
PAH+ is observed with the increase in scatter in comparison
to its control, unmodified ConA without PAH+ (Figure 6). Moreover, the unmodified ConA/PAH+ aggregates were observed as white particulates within the solution
(Figure 7). In contrast, PEGylated ConA’s
interaction with PAH+ showed relatively no change in scattering,
indicating no aggregate formation. This may be due to the masking
of the charges on ConA by the mPEG chains and thereby preventing ConA
adhesion to PAH+. To validate this data, separate solutions
of ConA, PEGylated ConA, and PAH+ were used as controls.
During the same time period, there were no changes in the scatter
of these controls. This establishes that the increase in scatter was
a direct result of the interaction between unmodified ConA and PAH+. Therefore, PEGylation proved useful in the minimization
of electrostatic-induced aggregation of ConA. This is desirable when
aiming to encapsulate the ConA based assay within a carrier (e.g.,
layer-by-layer microcapsules) as it may allow the assay to remain
free in solution and, thus, maintain its full activity.

Conclusions
ConA was modified via PEGylation in an
attempt to overcome major
obstacles associated with its translation to in vivo applications. While unmodified ConA showed immediate instability
in free solution within a physiologically relevant environment, PEGylated
ConA showed no such aggregation for at least 30 days. This stability
in free solution allowed for its binding affinity to be tested over
the same time period. Results showed that PEGylated ConA maintains
an ideal binding affinity to the rationally designed APTS-MT for use
in a competitive binding assay, and this utility was displayed by
tracking physiologically relevant glucose concentrations using a fluorescence
anisotropy assay. Moreover, PEGylated ConA is capable of resisting
electrostatic interactions with PAH+, a polymer typically
used in layer-by-layer encapsulation strategies. Together, these results
with PEGylated ConA are encouraging for the development of a ConA-based
continuous glucose monitoring device for in vivo application.
