A wide
variety of biological processes rely upon interactions between
proteins and lipids, ranging from molecular transport to the organization
of the cell membrane. It was recently established that electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is capable of capturing transient
interactions between membrane proteins and their lipid environment,
and a detailed understanding of the underlying processes is therefore
of high importance. Here, we apply ESI-MS to investigate the factors
that govern complex formation in solution and gas phases by comparing
nonselective lipid binding with soluble and membrane proteins. We
find that exogenously added lipids did not bind to soluble proteins,
suggesting that lipids have a low propensity to form electrospray
ionization adducts. The presence of detergents at increasing micelle
concentrations, on the other hand, resulted in moderate lipid binding
to soluble proteins. A direct ESI-MS comparison of lipid binding to
the soluble protein serum albumin and to the integral membrane protein
NapA shows that soluble proteins acquire fewer lipid adducts. Our
results suggest that protein–lipid complexes form via contacts
between proteins and mixed lipid/detergent micelles. For soluble proteins,
these complexes arise from nonspecific contacts between the protein
and detergent/lipid micelles in the electrospray droplet. For membrane
proteins, lipids are incorporated into the surrounding micelle in
solution, and complex formation occurs independently of the ESI process.
We conclude that the lipids in the resulting complexes interact predominantly
with sites located in the transmembrane segments, resulting in nativelike
complexes that can be interrogated by MS.

==== Body
Many proteins
interact with
lipids and membranes in their native environment. Membrane proteins
in particular use lipid binding to tune their biological function.
These lipid contacts are, however, often transient and heterogeneous,
and therefore can be difficult to observe directly. Electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), which is now widely applied to study noncovalent
protein complexes, has recently been adapted to study integral membrane
proteins through controlled ejection from detergent micelles in the
gas phase.1 By use of suitable detergents
in combination with collisional activation, ESI-MS is also able to
preserve the interactions between membrane proteins and phospholipids,
allowing detailed insights into the interactions with their native
lipid environment.1,2 The approach is applicable to
lipids that are incorporated into the protein structure as well as
annular lipids that modulate protein function or stability.3−5 The range of protein–lipid interactions that can be observed
by ESI-MS is surprisingly large: lipids can be copurified with the
protein and retained even under denaturing conditions,6−8 but lipids may also be added directly to detergent-solubilized membrane
proteins to yield nativelike complexes with defined compositions.9−11 Although only certain lipids are able to exert structural or functional
effects, insights from ESI-MS suggest that membrane proteins exhibit
a robust ability to bind a large variety of lipids, with the intensity
and number of lipid adducts being largely determined by the lipid
concentration.9 In this respect, lipid
binding to membrane proteins shows hallmarks of nonspecific adduct
formation, a common feature in ESI-MS of protein–ligand complexes.
Nonspecific electrospray adducts occur when free ligand molecules
are concentrated in the same droplet as the protein during the last
stages of the electrospray process and are deposited on the protein
surface as the solvent evaporates.12−15

Here, we investigate the
formation and preservation of protein–lipid
complexes in ESI-MS by comparing the lipid-binding abilities of membrane
proteins and soluble proteins. We selected three well-understood soluble
protein systems: ubiquitin, for which no lipid interactions have been
reported; bovine serum albumin (BSA), which has a well-documented
propensity to bind lipids nonspecifically in solution in line with
its biological role as a carrier protein;16,17 and the N-terminal domain of major ampullate spidroin 1 (MaSp1-NT),
which, although highly soluble, shares the α-helical architecture
and segregation of charged surface areas common among integral membrane
proteins and has been suggested to interact with lipids during storage
in the silk gland.18,19 Interestingly, we find that,
in all three cases, the lipids do not form nonspecific electrospray
adducts and instead require the presence of detergent micelles to
associate with proteins. In line with this, direct comparisons show
that membrane proteins exhibit a greater lipid-binding propensity
than soluble proteins. Our findings suggest that detergent micelles
serve as vehicles that mediate the lipid binding, and consequently,
the interactions between lipids and membrane proteins evidenced by
ESI-MS are reflective of contacts formed in solution rather than simply
nonspecific adduct formation.

Experimental Section
Bovine serum
albumin (BSA) and ubiquitin were purchased from Sigma.
NapA and MaSp1-NT were purified as described.20 Phospholipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) were dissolved at approximately
5 mg of dry material in 1 mL of CHCl3 in a glass vial.
Lipid films were generated by solvent evaporation under a stream of
N2 and dried in a vacuum chamber overnight. Dry lipid films
were solvated in deionized H2O by multiple rounds of sonication
and vortexing and subsequently lyophilized. The resulting lipid cakes
were dissolved in 1 mL of dH2O and centrifuged for 1 h
at maximum speed in a benchtop centrifuge. The supernatant was subjected
to phosphate analysis to determine the lipid content, revealing a
final lipid concentration between 100 and 500 μM, and was stored
in 50 μL aliquots at −20 °C.

Prior
to MS analysis, ubiquitin, BSA and MaSp1-NT were desalted
by exchange into 1 M ammonium acetate, pH 7.5, using BioSpin microcentrifuge
columns. For soluble proteins, detergents were added after buffer
exchange at the concentrations indicated below. Critical micelle concentration
(cmc) values were taken from le Maire et al.21 NapA samples were subjected to solvent and detergent exchanges into
100 mM ammonium acetate pH 7.5 containing 0.5% tetraethylene glycol
monooctyl ether (C8E4) at 4 °C in a Superdex Increase 200 column
on an Äkta Purifier FPLC system (GE Healthcare). MS analyses
were conducted at a protein concentration of approximately 10 μM
and a lipid concentration of approximately 50 μM unless noted
otherwise.

Samples were introduced into the mass spectrometer
by use of gold-coated
borosilicate capillaries produced in-house. Mass spectra were recorded
on a Waters Synapt G1 mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA) adapted
by the manufacturer for high mass analysis and operated in time-of-flight
(ToF) mode unless noted otherwise. Instrument settings were as follows:
capillary voltage 1.5 kV, sample cone voltage 30 V, extraction voltage
4 V, collision voltages in the trap ranging between 10 and 130 V,
bias voltage 5 V, and transfer collision voltage 10 V. The source
pressure was 5 mbar. Trap gas was N2 with a flow rate of
6 mL/h for BSA and NapA and 2 mL/h for ubiquitin and MaSp1-NT. For
ion mobility (IM) mass spectrometry of BSA, T-wave velocity was 350
m/s and wave height was 10 V in the IMS cell. The transfer wave velocity
was 248 m/s and the transfer wave height 13 V. IMS cell gas was N2 with a pressure of 1.6 Torr. Data analysis was performed
with the Waters MassLynx 4.1 and PULSAR software packages.22

Results
As a first step, we optimized
the ESI-MS conditions for the soluble
proteins ubiquitin, serum albumin, and MaSp1-NT for maximal preservation
of noncovalent ligand interactions. This was done by raising the source
pressure to 5 mbar, reducing the cone voltage to 30 V, and setting
the trap and transfer voltages to 10 V.23 Under these conditions, we observed narrow charge-state distributions
for all proteins, as well as moderate peak broadening attributable
to salt adducts that could be removed by raising the collision voltage
in the trap region to 50 V.

Having established suitable MS conditions,
we attempted to observe
protein–lipid interactions using a direct ESI-MS binding assay.24 For this purpose, the anionic phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol
(POPG) or the zwitterionic phospholipids 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) or 1-hexadecanoyl-2-(9Z-octadecenoyl)-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) were
prepared according to the standard solubilization protocol (see Experimental Section)25 and added directly to the protein in buffered ammonium acetate solution.
In all cases, lipids were present in a final concentration of 20-fold
excess over the protein. First, we tested ubiquitin, for which no
lipid interactions are reported. No peaks were observed corresponding
to the mass of the protein with one or more lipid adducts. We then
applied the same approach to serum albumin, which is a lipid carrier,
and MaSp1-NT, which has charged as well as hydrophobic surfaces, but
we did not detect any lipid binding in either case (Figure 1, red traces). Lipids were
added to the integral membrane protein NapA in the detergent tetraethylene
glycol monooctyl ether (C8E4), a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) detergent
with a mildly polar head composed of four ether groups. C8E4 can easily
be removed at low activation energies and in this manner facilitates
MS analysis under gentle ionization conditions, while “milder”
detergents like N-dodecyl β-d-maltoside
(DDM) remain bound at high activation energies (Figure S1).26 When analyzed under
identical MS conditions, all three phospholipids (POPG, POPE, and
POPC) were found to bind to the protein (Figure S2). We then added C8E4 to the soluble proteins to match the
solvent conditions used for membrane proteins. At 2× CMC, the
detergent caused moderate charge reduction but had no adverse effects
on peak intensity or the width of the charge-state distributions of
ubiquitin, serum albumin, or MaSp1-NT. We then repeated the direct
binding assay by adding POPG directly to the ubiquitin solution containing
2× cmc C8E4 (Figure 1, green traces). Surprisingly, the spectra showed an adduct
peak corresponding in mass to the protein with a POPG molecule bound.
Similarly, peaks indicating binding of one POPG lipid could be observed
for serum albumin in the presence of C8E4. Lipid addition to MaSp1-NT
with C8E4 resulted in the appearance of peaks indicative of one, two,
or three bound POPG molecules. Repeating the experiment with the phospholipids
POPE and POPC, we found that only minor amounts of POPC and no POPE
remained bound to MaSp1-NT in the gas phase. Ubiquitin exhibited a
similar pattern, readily retaining POPG and minor amounts of POPC,
while serum albumin bound only to POPG. By contrast the integral membrane
protein NapA was found to bind all three lipids, although POPG addition
again resulted in more intense adduct peaks than the addition of POPC
or POPE (Figure S2).

The crucial role of the detergent in lipid binding
led us to speculate
that it helps to solubilize the lipids and in this manner increase
their accessibility for nonselective association. Examination of the
low m/z region revealed large amounts
of free lipid monomers and dimers present under even the gentlest
MS conditions in the absence of detergent, as well as only a moderate
increase in lipid monomers after the addition of detergent (Figure S3A,B). To investigate whether the charge-reducing
effects of the detergent promote the detection of protein–lipid
complexes, we recorded spectra of MaSp1-NT and POPG in the presence
of 2.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which, like C8E4, has been shown
to provide charge reduction and preserves noncovalent interactions
following ESI-MS.27 Interestingly, addition
of DMSO instead of C8E4 did not lead to the formation of protein–lipid
complexes (Figure S3C).

Having established
that the observed effects are related specifically
to the presence of detergent, we selected the interaction between
MaSp1-NT and POPG to investigate the effect of detergent concentration
while keeping the lipid concentration constant. The presence of submicellar
amounts of C8E4 (0.13%) led to the appearance of only minor lipid
adducts. Raising the C8E4 concentration to 1× cmc (0.25%) caused
a moderate increase in the intensity of the peaks assigned to protein–lipid
complexes, while significant lipid binding could only be observed
at 2× cmc (0.5%) (Figure 2 A).

Figure 2 Effective protein–lipid complex formation requires
the presence
of high amounts of detergent micelles. (A) Complexes between MaSP1-NT
and POPG could be observed only in the presence of C8E4 above the
cmc. (B) Detergents with lower cmc did not promote binding of POPG
to MaSp1-NT. However, when the concentration of C10E6 was increased
to that of C8E4, moderate lipid binding could be observed.

We next investigated whether the number of micelles
had an effect
on lipid binding to MaSp1-NT. Longer chain-length detergents have
a greatly reduced CMC, thus forming fewer micelles when these detergents
are added at low concentrations. In addition to C8E4, we selected N-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM, cmc 0.009%),
C12E9 (cmc 0.003%), and C10E6 (cmc 0.03%). At 2× cmc, the approximate
micelle concentrations were 200 μM (C8E4), 27 μM (C10E6),
1 μM (C12E9), and 4 μM (DDM). Interestingly, at these
concentrations, none of the three detergents led to the formation
of protein–lipid complexes (Figure 2 B). If, however, C10E6 was added at 10×
cmc, which effectively increases the micelle concentration to 135
μM, complexes between MaSp1-NT and POPG could be observed. Taken
together, this suggests that the formation of protein–lipid
complexes is promoted by increasing the number of detergent micelles
to the range where nonspecific protein micelle interactions are likely
to occur.

Previous studies demonstrated that lipid binding conveys
stabilization
of membrane proteins against collisional unfolding.9 We therefore investigated the stability of complexes between
ubiquitin, serum albumin, or MaSp1-NT and POPG by subjecting them
to collisional activation by increasing the voltage in the ion trap
of the mass spectrometer. Interestingly, we found that the three protein–lipid
complexes exhibited differential stabilities against collisional dissociation:
while MaSp1-NT complexes with POPG dissociated readily at low collision
voltages (10–50 V), the interaction between serum albumin and
a single POPG molecule remained intact well above 100 V (Figure 3 A and Figure S4). We therefore selected this complex
to analyze the impact of lipid binding on the conformational stability
of the protein by monitoring the change in the arrival-time distribution
in response to gas-phase activation.28 We
found that the lipid-bound protein was able to retain a compact conformation
at higher activation energies, suggesting that POPG binding imparts
stabilization against unfolding (Figure 3 B), although to a lesser extent than in
integral membrane proteins.5,9 The tight association
can be rationalized by multivalent charge interactions between serum
albumin and ligand.29 In fact, this protein
contains a protected phospholipid-binding pocket, in addition to several
low-affinity sites, in which the lipid is bound via contacts between
basic residues and the ionic phosphate headgroup.30 Our data suggest that lipid interactions with selected
binding sites on soluble proteins can mirror effects observed for
membrane proteins.9

conveys gas-phase stabilization. (A) 1:1 complexes
between BSA and POPG exhibit remarkable resistance to collisional
dissociation. (Inset) Crystal structure of human serum albumin with
lysophosphatidylethanolamine (green) bound to an internal binding
site. (B) Collisional activation and ion mobility MS of POPG-bound
BSA reveals higher resilience of the BSA–POPG complex to gas-phase
unfolding compared to the apoprotein.

The fact that serum albumin–POPG complexes remain
intact
in the energy regime required for MS analysis of membrane proteins
enabled us to compare the lipid-binding abilities of membrane proteins
and soluble proteins directly. Serum albumin and the dimeric sodium-proton
exchanger NapA, an integral membrane protein with no known lipid preferences,5,31 have comparable molecular masses (66 and 84 kDa, respectively) and
retain bound lipids across a broad activation energy range. We therefore
recorded mass spectra of a solution containing both proteins in 2×
cmc C8E4 and a 10-fold excess of POPG at different collision voltages.
Although an equimolar amount of both proteins was present, we found
that only peaks assigned to serum albumin could be detected across
the entire collision energy range (Figure 4). NapA, on the other hand, was detected
only at collision voltages above 80 V. The higher activation energy
required for observation of NapA is consistent with disruption of
the detergent micelle prior to release into the gas phase and implies
that NapA, but not serum albumin, is incorporated into detergent micelles.

Figure 4 Simultaneous
ESI-MS analysis of BSA and the integral membrane protein
NapA. BSA can be detected at low collision voltages, suggesting that
it is not incorporated into detergent micelles. Increasing the collision
voltage releases NapA, revealing preferential binding of POPG. Asterisks
indicate unfolded NapA monomers. POPG concentration is 25 μM.

The presence of a 10-fold excess
of POPG leads to the appearance
of multiple lipid adduct peaks of high intensity for NapA. This observation
is in agreement with previous membrane protein studies.9,10 By contrast, only a single, minor lipid adduct peak was observed
for serum albumin (Figure 4). Although the elevated collision voltage required to simultaneously
observe free NapA and serum albumin has the potential to partially
remove lipid adducts, these results clearly indicate that the integral
membrane protein NapA has a much greater propensity to form protein–lipid
complexes than the soluble serum albumin when both proteins are exposed
to the same detergent/lipid environment. The preferential binding
to NapA correlates well with the greater hydrophobic surface area
within an overall comparable solvent-accessible surface (Table S1).

Discussion
In
this study we investigated the factors that influence the association
of lipids with soluble and membrane proteins in ESI-MS. While previous
studies of soluble protein–lipid complexes focused on systems
with specific lipid-binding abilities,32−34 we now show that the
propensity of the common membrane lipids POPG, POPC, and POPE to form
electrospray adducts is surprisingly low. The formation of protein–lipid
complexes that can be preserved in the gas phase is instead critically
dependent on the presence of detergent micelles in solution. We attribute
this effect to the low cmc of phospholipids, which promotes the formation
of lipid clusters in solution and thus limits their availability for
association with proteins. In the presence of detergent, on the other
hand, the negatively charged lipid POPG was found to associate readily
with all proteins tested, while few, if any, complexes with zwitterionic
lipids POPC or POPE could be detected.

When subjected to ESI-MS
in the presence of detergent, the soluble
proteins ubiquitin, MaSp1-NT, and BSA and the membrane protein NapA
exhibit distinct lipid-binding properties: ubiquitin acquires low
amounts of lipid adducts, in line with the notion that this protein
does not engage in significant lipid interactions in vivo. Serum albumin,
on the other hand, can tightly bind a single lipid molecule, suggesting
a high-affinity binding site. MaSp1-NT exhibits a higher lipid-binding
propensity than ubiquitin and BSA, suggesting that the availability
of large charged and/or hydrophobic patches promotes association.
Interestingly, soluble spidroins are stored in the sac of the silk
gland alongside phospholipids.19 Molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations suggest that the charged patches are freely
accessible in the soluble proteins,19 and
it may therefore be possible that lipids play a role in spidroin storage,
perhaps by masking self-assembling protein interfaces, for example.
The integral membrane protein NapA binds a large number of lipids
with high resistance to collisional activation, as expected from its
extensive interactions with the surrounding membrane.

Our results
allow us to propose a general mechanism for the generation
of protein–lipid complexes that can be observed in ESI-MS (Figure 5). Lipids preferentially
incorporate into detergent micelles that provide shielding from the
hydrophilic environment. During desolvation, the mixed lipid/detergent
clusters dissociate, while lipids that bind with higher affinity than
the detergent, for example via headgroup interactions, are left attached
to the protein surface. Protein–lipid complexes are then formed
via interactions between the proteins and the lipid-containing detergent
micelles. Lipid binding to soluble proteins is accordingly promoted
by increasing the concentration of detergent/lipid micelles. The ESI
process favors nonspecific associations if multiple components are
present in the same electrospray droplet, which has been estimated
to arise at component concentrations above 50 μM.35 This is in agreement with our observation that
lipid binding increases significantly at micelle concentrations above
200 μM. In detergents like DDM and C12E9, the low number of
micelles (<5 μM at 2× cmc) limits the amount of ESI
droplets that contain both protein and mixed detergent/lipid micelles,
and virtually no protein–lipid complexes can be observed. Membrane
proteins, on the other hand, are fully inserted into detergent micelles,
exposing large surfaces for interactions with the embedded lipids,
and complex formation occurs therefore in solution, independently
of the electrospray process. Here, the entire protein–micelle
complex is ionized as a single component instead. The detergent is
subsequently removed by additional collisional activation, resulting
in multiple lipids attached to the protein surface that was previously
buried in the micelle.

Figure 5 Mechanism for detergent-mediated formation of protein–lipid
complexes. Lipids preferentially insert into detergent micelles. At
sufficient micelle concentrations, soluble proteins and detergent/lipid
micelles are ionized in the same electrospray droplet, making superficial
contacts with the embedded lipids. Membrane proteins continually expose
large surfaces to the intramicellar environment regardless of micelle
concentration, leading to multiple lipid contacts. Desolvation and
collisional activation remove the loosely bound detergent, releasing
the protein–lipid complex for MS detection.

In summary, we show that ESI-MS captures interactions
between membrane
proteins and exogenous lipids as they occur inside detergent micelles,
while the contributions from nonspecific electrospray adduct formation
are negligible. ESI-MS is therefore suitable to study even transient
protein–lipid interactions that may be inaccessible by other
approaches.
