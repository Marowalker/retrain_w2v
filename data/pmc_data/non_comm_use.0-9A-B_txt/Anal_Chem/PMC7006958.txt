The
intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica has evolved
an array of traits for propagation and invasion of the
intestinal layers. It remains largely elusive how Salmonella adjusts its metabolic states to survive inside immune host cells.
In this study, single-cell Raman biotechnology combined with deuterium
isotope probing (Raman-DIP) have been applied to reveal metabolic
changes of the typhoidal Salmonella Typhi Ty2, the
nontyphoidal Salmonella Typhimurium LT2, and a clinical
isolate Typhimurium D23580. By initially labeling the Salmonella strains with deuterium, we employed reverse labeling to track their
metabolic changes in the time-course infection of THP-1 cell line,
human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) and macrophages (Mf).
We found that, in comparison with a noninvasive serovar, the invasive Salmonella strains Ty2 and D23580 have downregulated metabolic
activity inside human macrophages and dendritic cells and used lipids
as alternative carbon source, perhaps a strategy to escape from the
host immune response. Proteomic analysis using high sensitivity mass
spectrometry validated the findings of Raman-DIP analysis.

==== Body
Salmonella enterica (S. enterica) is a Gram-negative,
facultative anaerobic,
intracellular pathogen, responsible for a wide range of diseases. Salmonella accounts for 16 million cases of typhoid fever
and 1.3 billion cases of gastroenteritis per year.1 In humans, the outcome of S. enterica infection
mostly depends on the infecting serovar. Infection with human-restricted
typhoidal serovars, such as S. enterica serovar Typhi
(S. Typhi) and Paratyphi (S. Paratyphi),
results in typhoid fever; while nontyphoidal broad host range serovars,
such as S. enterica serovar Typhimurium
(S. Typhimurium), are usually responsible of localized
self-limiting gastroenteritis.2

Nevertheless,
highly invasive multidrug resistant S. Typhimurium
serovars have emerged in sub-Saharan Africa, as a major
cause of lethal bacteremia in malnourished anemic children and individuals
affected by underlying diseases such as malaria or HIV.3−8S. Typhimurium isolates from Kenya and Malawi are
predominantly of a novel multilocus sequence type (ST) named ST313.7 The S. Typhimurium STS313 pathovar
D23580 (STM-D23580) is a representative blood-stream clinical isolate
which demonstrates genome degradation, resembling that of the human
restricted pathogen S. Typhi.7 STM-D23580 has been largely used in studies of host–pathogen
interactions to gain deeper insights into its increased pathogenicity,
named as invasive nontyphoidal salmonellosis (iNTS).

In order
to survive and replicate within host cells, Salmonella undergoes dramatic metabolic changes to utilize the available intracellular
nutrients and to overcome adverse endosomal conditions.9,10 These adaptions, alongside with genetic variances, contribute to
the different disease outcomes upon Salmonella infections.
Technological perspectives have emerged to obtain a comprehensive
picture of intracellular pathogen lifestyle. Transcriptomic11 and proteomic studies12,13 give insights into the mechanisms adopted by Salmonella to regulate its metabolic pathways in response to host cell environment.
However, these technologies rely on highly expressed genes and proteins,
thus overseeing subtle metabolic changes and a crucial fraction of
nonenzymatic metabolic reactions.14 Most
of the investigations provide a bulk average measurement of the total
bacterial population, but phenotypes of bacteria will adapt when invading
human cells.15−17

Single-cell Raman microspectroscopy (SCRM) offers phenotypic analysis
at the single-cell
resolution. Compared with other single-cell techniques, such as flow
cytometry and nanosecondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS), SCRM
measures intrinsic chemical profile of a cell in a nondestructive
and relatively cheap manner.18−20 Single cell Raman spectrum (SCRS)
provides a biochemical “fingerprint” of individual cell
containing the molecular vibrational modes of all biomolecules, reflecting
physiological and metabolic states of the cell.21,22 Raman-deuterium isotope labeling (Raman-DIP) is able to identify
and measure general metabolic activity of microbes by detecting a
C–D signature band.23 When cells
are cultured in heavy water (D2O), NADPD (originally NADPH)
is formed due to an exchange of H/D and facilitates synthesis of deuterated
biomolecules, leading to the formation of carbon-deuterium (C–D)
bonds that display a distinguishable Raman band in an otherwise silent
region (2070–2300 cm–1) in SCRS.

In
this study, we applied SCRS, Raman-DIP, and reverse labeling24 to obtain comprehensive and time-resolved profiles
of the intracellular metabolism of three Salmonella strains responsible for different clinical outcomes: the gastroenteritis-associated S. Typhimurium LT2 (STM-LT2), the nontyphoidal invasive S. Typhimurium D23580 (STM-D23580), and the typhoidal S. Typhi Ty2 (ST-Ty2). The results from single-cell Raman
analysis were further validated by proteomics using high sensitivity
mass spectrometry.

Experimental Section
Bacterial Strains and Culture
Conditions
Salmonella
enterica serovar Typhimurium (STM) strain LT2 (ATCC 700220)
and the clinical isolate STM-D23580, were used as representative nontyphoidal Salmonella sequence type 19 (ST19) and type 313 (ST313),
respectively. Strain D23580 was isolated from the blood of an HIV-negative
Malawian child with malaria and anemia. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (ST) strain Ty2 (ATCC 700931) was used as representative
typhoidal serovar. Escherichia coli strain DH5α
(EC-DH5α) (ATCC 67878) was used as an external reference for
comparison with Salmonella strains. Details of the
growth conditions for infection experiments are in the Supporting Information.

Infection
Generation
of eukaryotic cells is detailed
in the Supporting Information. Two hours
before infection, the medium was replaced with fresh complete medium
without antibiotics. THP-1 cells, monocyte-derived dendritic cells
(MoDCs), and macrophages (Mf) were infected with D-labeled STM-LT2,
STM-D23580, or ST-Ty2 at a MOI of 30 bacteria per cell (THP-1), 10
bacteria per cell (MoDCs), or 15 bacteria per cell (Mf). After 30
min incubation at 37 °C (THP-1 and Mf) or 45 min at 37 °C
(MoDCs), extracellular bacteria were removed by washing cells twice
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and further incubated for 30
min in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine,
and 100 μg/mL of gentamycin (MP Biomedicals) to kill extracellular
bacteria. After that, the gentamycin concentration was reduced to
30 μg/mL for the rest of the experiment. At each time point,
eukaryotic cells were lysed by addition of 500 μL of saponin
2% (w/v) (Sigma) in PBS, followed by 5 min incubation at 37 °C.
Cell lysates were used for SCRS or were serially diluted 10-fold in
PBS and plated onto LB Lennox Broth agar (Sigma) to count CFU.

Mf and differentiated THP-1 cells are specialized phagocytic cells
that quickly uptake and clear pathogens by engulfing them. Across
ex-vivo settings, incubation times of 30 min or even less, guarantee
successful internalization of Salmonella by human
macrophages. The phagocytic activity of dendritic cells is less pronounced.25 After sensing pathogens via receptors or via
inflammatory stimuli, dendritic cells switch on the expression of
chemokine receptors, migrate to draining lymphoid organs and undergo
a process of maturation. Unlike Mf, the major task of the dendritic
cell is not to clear pathogens but to present antigens to T lymphocytes.
Pathogen uptake, phagosomal degradation, and acidification are much
lower in dendritic cells than in macrophages. Hence, to maximize the
phagocytic activity of MoDCs, Salmonella strains
were sampled at different time points, reflecting effector functions
of each cell type. This sampling strategy is consistent to the previous
reports.26−28

Single-Cell Raman Spectra (SCRS) Measurements
and Analysis
At specific time point p.i., bacteria grown
in RPMI and cell lysates
of THP-1, MoDCs, and Mf were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS
(PFA, EMS) (v/v) at RT for 15 min, and washed twice with Milli-Q water.
SCRS were acquired for at least 30 bacterial cells per each condition
using an HR Evolution confocal Raman microscope (Horiba Jobin-Yvon,
France). Parameters of acquisition are in the Supporting Information.

Raman Data Preprocessing
and Analysis
All spectra were
recorded and preprocessed by comic ray correction and polyline baseline
fitting using LabSpec 6 (Horiba Scientific, France). Spectral normalization
was done by vector normalization of the entire spectral region. Data
analysis, statistics and visualization were done under an R environment
using in-house scripts. Quantification of intracellular biomolecule
and D content was done by integrating corresponding Raman bands in
SCRS (details in the Supporting Information). The ratio of C–D/(C–D + C–H) was used to
indicate the extent of deuterium incorporation and this ratio of three Salmonella strains was mean-normalized at t = 0 h. Donor-wise centering has been done in all analysis. A machine
learning classification model was built based on the fingerprint region
of SCRS of inoculum STM-LT2, STM-D23580 and ST-Ty2, based on k-Nearest-Neighbor
(kNN) algorithm. Leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) was used to
evaluate the performance of the model and performance measures were
computed as sensitivity for each strain as well as an overall accuracy
rate.

LC-MS/MS Measurements and Analysis
The preparation
of bacteria from MoDCs for proteomic experiments is described in the Supporting Information. LC-MS/MS analyses of
tryptic peptides were performed using an UltiMate 3000 RSLC coupled
to a Q Exactive plus mass spectrometer via a Nanospray Flex Ion Source
(Thermo-Fisher Scientific Idstein, Germany; Table S1). Raw data files from the LC-MS/MS runs were analyzed using
MaxQuant version 1.5.3.8. Protein identification for STM-LT2 and STM-D23580
was based upon a Salmonella FASTA database file which
contained 4,547 target entries (S. Typhimurium strain
LT2/SGSC1412/ATCC 700720, UniProt; proteome ID UP000001014; November
28, 2017). A FASTA database with 4,295 Salmonella typhi entries (S. Typhi strain Ty2/ATCC 700931,
UniProt, proteome ID UP000002622; February 27, 2018) was applied for
the ST-Ty2MS data. Details in MaxQuant analyses are in the Supporting Information. Log2 transformed label-free
quantification (LFQ) intensities were calculated and pairwise comparisons
of p.i. 0.75, 2, 4, and 6 h (6 pairs in total) were done using empirical
Bayes approach in LIMMA package. Proteins with p <
0.05 (moderated t test) at any pairwise comparison
were determined as differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). DEPs
were then functionally annotated using Biocyc database.

Due
to the very low number of bacteria isolated, a classical prenormalization
by total protein concentration determination could not be applied.
Similar to previous in vivo studies on S. aureus,29 all available bacteria
cells were used to get a maximum of proteins per sample. In order
to get equal amounts in MS, we used a 2 μg ZipTip bed to roughly
equalize the peptide amounts before loading them on HPLC-column. In
addition, a postmeasurement statistical normalization was further
done by default in LFQ calculation in MaxQuant,30 assuming that most proteins do not change between different
samples of the same organism. Supporting evidence of this assumption
is that 602 proteins were found in all three analyzed conditions.

Results and Discussion
Phenotypic Profiles Based on Single-Cell
Raman Spectra Distinguished
Closely Related Salmonella Strains
In order
to understand whether the genetically close Salmonella strains (STM-LT2, STM-D23580, and ST-Ty2), yet responsible of distinct
clinical manifestations in humans, can be discriminated by their metabolic
profiles, SCRS of bacterial cultures were obtained and analyzed. Figure 1A shows the SCRS
of STM-LT2, STM-D23580, and ST-Ty2, averaged from 30 to 50 single-cell
measurements of each strain. Wavenumbers and corresponding vibrational
modes of spectral features assigned to nucleic acids, proteins, lipids,
and carbohydrates are summarized in Table S2. Unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce
the high dimensional Raman data set and reveal key information responsible
for single-cell variances. PCA plot along the first two principal
components (PC1 and PC2) separates the three bacterial strains, in
which the invasive, nontyphoidal STM-D23580 sits in between the noninvasive,
nontyphoidal STM-LT2 and the invasive, typhoidal ST-Ty2 (Figure 1B). It indicates
that the three Salmonella strains (STM-LT2, STM-D23580
and ST-Ty2) have distinctive phenotypic profiles.

Figure 1 (A) Average SCRS of overnight
cultures of STM-LT2, STM-D23580,
and ST-Ty2 from 30 to 50 single-cell measurements. The shaded area
in SCRS represents the standard deviation. (B) PCA plot based on the
fingerprint region of the SCRS. (C) Boxplots show semiquantification
of selected biomolecules by integrating relevant Raman bands. Statistics
(Welch’s t test) indicates pairwise differences
(ns: p > 0.05; *: p < 0.05;
**: p < 0.01; ***: p < 0.001;
****; p < 0.0001). “CH” represents
“carbohydrates”;
“DNA” represents “DNA/RNA”; “Tyr”
represents “tyrosine”; “Phe” represents
“phenylalanine”.

We then performed quantification of intracellular biomolecules
by integrating relevant Raman bands to highlight the phenotypic differences
among the three strains (Figure 1C and Table S2). The most
significant differences were observed in carbohydrates (carbohydrates
III), nucleic acids (adenine and DNA/RNA), lipids (lipid II), amino
acids, and proteins (tyrosine, amide III, and amide I). These differences
correlate with the Raman contributions along PC1 of the PCA, which
accounts for the highest variances among single bacterial cells (Figure S1).

A number of traits in the Raman
metabolic profiles indicate a closer
congruity between the invasive STM-D23580 and ST-Ty2, than to the
noninvasive STM-LT2 (Figure 1C). The most significant changes in peak intensity between
the two invasive strains and STM-LT2 were observed in Raman wavenumbers
at 722 and 780 cm–1, corresponding to nucleic acids
(adenine and DNA/RNA) and at 1574 and 1662 cm–1,
corresponding to proteins (amide III and amide I; Figure 1A and Table S2). An increased DNA/RNA intensity could be due to different
DNA states, transitioning from a condensate form in STM-LT2 to an
uncoiled form in STM-D23580 and ST-Ty2, ready for more transcription
activities in these invasive strains. The relaxed states of DNA facilitate
efficient transcription, which may also account for the high intensity
of the amide peaks, and thus more protein synthesis in STM-D23580
and ST-Ty2.

It was previously reported that S. Typhi no longer
retains the pathway for tyrosine utilization31 because this serovar does not remain long enough in the gut to utilize
the aromatic compounds produced by the human intestinal flora.32 In agreement, the tyrosine peak (853 cm–1) is significantly lower in ST-Ty2 and STM-D23580
as compared to STM-LT2 (Figure 1C). Surface lipids and proteins are often antigenic and represent
the first line of contact with the host immune system. Lipid II at
1450 cm–1 which refers to saturated lipids that
are abundant in bacterial cell wall is significantly higher in STM-LT2
as compared to STM-D23580 and ST-Ty2. The development of a robust
outer membrane with increased level of saturated lipids confers resistance
to antimicrobial peptides.33 This characteristic
might be of relevance to STM-LT2, which primarily resides in the gut
but can be lost in those pathovars that do not remain long enough
in the gut, such as ST-Ty2 and STM-D23580.

The carbohydrates
III (1043 cm–1) quantification,
on the other hand, indicates dissimilarities between the typhoidal
and the typhimurium strains, with ST-Ty2 exhibiting a significantly
lower content. The human-restricted serovars S. Typhi
and S. Paratyphi A harbor pseudogenes related to
the transport of d-glucarate into the cell, suggesting that
the utilization of this carbon source may not be advantageous in causing
invasive infection.31

While feature
extraction provides invaluable biochemical information
on the phenotypic differences, machine learning algorithms can be
used to resolve complex Raman information, classify bacterial species
and benefit diagnostic purposes. A classification model based on k-nearest-neighbor
(kNN) algorithm was applied to analyze SCRS of STM-LT2, STM-D23580,
and ST-Ty2. A leave-one-out-cross-validation evaluated the kNN model,
achieving an overall accuracy rate of 92.4% (Table S3). This classification model correctly classifies 106 out
of 116 STM-LT2 spectra (sensitivity 91.4%), 135 out of 152 STM-D23580
spectra (sensitivity 88.8%), and 122 out of 125 ST-Ty2 spectra (sensitivity
97.6%). The highest sensitivity rate is achieved in classifying ST-Ty2
indicating that substantial differences emerge between the typhoidal
and the nontyphoidal strains. Notably, all incorrect assignments of
STM-LT2 and ST-Ty2 solely belong to the class of STM-D23580, while
STM-D23580 is incorrectly classified as both STM-LT2 and ST-Ty2. This
is consistent with both results from the PCA and quantification of
biomolecules (Figure 1B,C). While STM-LT2 and ST-Ty2 bear distant resemblance, STM-D23580
is closely related to STM-LT2 at a taxonomic level but features many
of the ST-Ty2 traits.

Intracellular Salmonella Shows Distinctive
Metabolic Activities Revealed by Raman-DIP
We then sought
to implement Raman-DIP and reverse labeling to detect the metabolic
rates of Salmonella serovars. With the presence of
D2O, SCRS of STM-LT2 showed a distinguishable C–D
band at 2170 cm–1, similar to Escherichia
coli DH5α (EC-DH5α), due to an incorporation
of D via NADPH during active metabolism (Figure S2). Hence, the D incorporation in cells can be used as a universal
indicator of metabolic activity applicable to Salmonella spp..

To better understand the metabolic features that underlie Salmonella’s survival and replication within the
host cells, we initially labeled the three Salmonella strains with deuterium and employed reverse labeling24 to trace the metabolic changes over time during
the interaction of Salmonella with human host cells.
We obtained SCRS of STM-LT2, STM-D23580 and ST-Ty2 recovered at different
time points post infection (p.i.) of THP-1 cell line, human MoDCs
and human Mf. Three strains growing in liquid culture were used as
extracellular controls. At each time point, the cellular D content
was quantified by calculating the ratio of C–D/(C–D
+ C–H) in SCRS of single bacterial cells. A greater gradient
(β) of D loss represents a faster replacement of C–H
band during active metabolism, thus a higher bacterial metabolic rate.

At free-living condition in the growth medium, SCRS of extracellular Salmonella illustrate a gradually decreasing C–D
band over time in all three Salmonella strains (Figure 2A). ST-Ty2 displays
the fastest D loss (−0.01233), compared to STM-LT2 (−0.00917)
and STM-D23580 (−0.00976), indicating that ST-Ty2 is the most
active and fastest duplicative strain in liquid culture, consistent
with the colony forming unit (CFU) counts (Figure S3A). In support of these results, the Raman phenotypic quantification
(Figure 1C) also shows
that in a nutrient-rich environment, the higher energy requirements
of ST-Ty2, necessary for its replication, is fulfilled by higher consumption
of carbohydrate stocks (Carbohydrates III). The extensive growth is
accompanied by a higher content of nucleic acids (DNA/RNA) ready for
transcription and increased protein production (amide III and amide
I; Figure 1C).

Figure 2 (A) SCRS of Salmonella serovars under four experimental
conditions: extracellular growth in liquid culture and intracellular
metabolism during infection of a differentiated THP-1 cell line, primary
MoDCs, and primary Mf (the band at ∼2500 cm–1 in the “culture” panel is instrumental artifact and
it has been corrected in later measurements). (B) Boxplots quantifying
D content at different time points. Statistics was done with one-way
ANOVA (ns: p > 0.05; *: p <
0.05;
**: p < 0.01; ***: p < 0.001;
****; p < 0.0001). The absolute value of linear
regression slope β represents the metabolism speed.

A decrease of the C–D band in the recovered
intracellular Salmonella was also observed in all
strains, during time-course
infection of THP-1 cells, MoDCs and Mf (Figure 2A). In contrast to the observation in the
liquid growth medium, all infection models show that ST-Ty2 was the
strain with the slowest metabolic rate (Figure 2B). In THP-1 cells, at 6 h p.i., a visible
amount of the C–D band is still present in the spectra of ST-Ty2,
as opposed to the complete absence of the C–D band in STM-LT2
and STM-D23580 (Figure 2A). Quantification of D content (Figure 2B) confirms that ST-Ty2 has the slowest metabolic
rate (−0.00351), comparing to STM-LT2 (−0.00583) and
STM-D23580 (−0.00476). A similar spectral pattern is also observed
in human MoDCs and Mf (Figure 2), where ST-Ty2 has the slowest metabolism (−0.00417
in MoDCs, −0.00192 in Mf), followed by STM-D23580 (−0.00471
in MoDCs, −0.00220 in Mf) and ST-LT2 (0.00718 in MoDCs, −0.00430
in Mf). The slowest metabolic rate of ST-Ty2 during infection in THP-1,
MoDCs and Mf also correlates with the CFU counting of the three Salmonella strains (Figure S3B–D). Therefore, in terms of Salmonella metabolic activity
in all infection models, the invasive ST-Ty2 has the slowest metabolic
rate, and the noninvasive STM-LT2 has the fastest metabolic rate,
while the activity of the nontyphoidal but invasive clinical strain
STM-D23580 is in between. It is known that the invasive host-adapted Salmonella replicates slowly and elicits weaker pro-inflammatory
responses2 in order to avoid immune-surveillance
and to disseminate inside host cells. Our results highlight a plausible
strategy adopted also by STM-D23580 to slow down its central metabolism
in an effort to survive intracellularly while avoiding immune recognition.

Overall, all three Salmonella strains exhibited
a slower metabolism in intracellular conditions than in free-living,
liquid growth medium. The metabolic activity was particularly reduced
in Mf as compared to THP-1 and MoDCs, most likely as a result of the
hostile acidic phagosomal environment.34 Likewise, Mf exhibited increased killing ability compared to THP-1
and MoDCs (Figure S3).

SCRS Map Dynamic
Phenotypic Profiles of Intracellular Salmonella within
Primary Cells
As SCRS provides
a snapshot of bacterial phenotypic profiles, we analyzed the SCRS
of intracellular cells for each Salmonella strain
by quantifying relevant Raman bands at different time points p.i.,
thus providing a phenotypic comparison across strains. Time-resolved
Raman profiles are summarized in Figure S4, while characteristic bands during primary cell infections are emphasized
in Figure 3. The detailed
analysis is shown as follows.

Figure 3 Raman profiling of biomolecules in intracellular
bacteria. Raman
bands of (A) carbohydrates III and lipid I, (B) the ratio of total
unsaturated fatty acids to total fatty acids (TUFA/TFA), (C) DNA/RNA,
amide I and the ratio of nucleic acids to proteins, and (D) adenine
and amide III were quantified in SCRS of STM-LT2, STM-D23580, and
ST-Ty2 at different time point of infection in MoDCs and Mf. Statistics
was done by using one-way ANOVA with a global p-value to indicate
general differences among time points (ns: p >
0.05;
*: p < 0.05; **: p < 0.01;
***: p < 0.001; ****; p <
0.0001). Linear regression was fitted to compare the time-wise changes
of one specific quantification in each strain and the slope was labeled
at the top right corner, where a negative value indicates a decrease
over time and a positive value indicates an increase over time.

Carbohydrates and Lipids
In MoDCs,
an increased consumption
of carbohydrates III in STM-LT2 (−0.08) is observed compared
with STM-D23580 (0.01) and ST-Ty2 (0.00), which indicates a greater
utilization of carbohydrate stocks by the noninvasive STM-LT2 during
infection (Figure 3A). On the contrary, a decrease of lipid I (saturated long chain
fatty acids) at 1320 cm–1 is observed in STM-D23580
(−0.11 in MoDCs, −0.12 in Mf) and ST-Ty2 (−0.23
in MoDCs, −0.15 in Mf), compared with in STM-LT2 (−0.05
in MoDCs, −0.11 in Mf). The results suggest that the invasive
ST-Ty2 and STM-D23580 should adopt a switch from carbohydrate consumption
to lipid consumption. In line with a previous study,35 our results suggest that invasive Salmonella appears to switch off the glycolytic pathways, using fatty acids
as carbon sources instead. The contribution of lipid metabolism to
the virulence and survival of Salmonella in the intravacuolar
environment has been highlighted in a number of studies.35,36

To further assess the modulation of Salmonella lipidic phenotype during its intracellular life, we analyzed the
higher wavenumber region of the SCRS (2700–3300 cm–1). The band centered at 3008 cm–1 in SCRS is representative
of unsaturated =CH stretching and the one at 2930 cm–1 represents all CH, CH2, and CH3 stretching
in the cell. The ratio of total unsaturated fatty acids/total fatty
acids (TUFA/TFA) is commonly used in Raman studies to characterize
lipid membrane profile as an index of bacterial adaption and response
to oxidative stress.37 Increased unsaturation
of lipids causes fluidizing of the membrane and allows membrane modifications
that enhance the tolerance of bacteria under stress conditions. As
bacterial membrane modification is particularly upon internalization,
we compared the TUFA/TFA ration between the intracellular and the
extracellular conditions (Figure 3B). The TUFA/TFA ratio in all conditions show a marked
upregulation in STM-LT2 (0.13 in MoDCs, 0.16 in Mf) compared to STM-D23580
(0.06 in MoDCs, 0.14 in Mf) and ST-Ty2 (0.11 in MoDCs, 0.07 in Mf),
highlighting the differences in membrane alteration between the invasive
and noninvasive strains. Notably, the TUFA/TFA ratio in all strains
increased dramatically from 0 to 0.5 h in Mf (t test,
**** in STM-LT2, *** in STM-D23580 and * in ST-Ty2), suggesting a
rearrangement of the surface moieties upon phagocytosis necessary
to resist to the hostile intramacrophage environment.

Nucleic Acids,
Proteins, and Aromatic AAs
A variation
in DNA/RNA is detected during MoDC infection for all bacterial strains,
with a marked upregulation at 2 h p.i. (t test, *
in STM-LT2, *** in STM-D23580 and ** in ST-Ty2), likely due to increased
DNA synthesis and transcriptions (Figure 3C). A decrease was observed in the invasive
STM-D23580 (−0.23) and ST-Ty2 (−0.20), as compared to
STM-LT2 (0.12). Amide I, a representative peak of C=O stretching
in proteins (Table S2), showed different
time-wise modulation as compared to DNA/RNA. We calculated the ratio
of nucleic acids/protein for all three Salmonella strains during infection as an indicator of intracellular bacterial
replication. Following a short increase of the ratio, a significant
decrease is observed in the invasive STM-D23580 (−0.22) and
ST-Ty2 (−0.16) compared to STM-LT2 (−0.04; Figure 3C). This result suggests
that the intracellular growth of the invasive strains may be arrested
in response to the adverse intracellular environment.

A transient
accumulation of adenine is observed for all of the bacterial strains
during the early stage of MoDC infection (Figure 3D). This result can be explained by the fact
that bacteria might have sufficient purine reserves to sustain only
the initial host cell attack. In Mf, significant alterations of the
adenine peak are detected for the Typhimurium strains only (Figure 3D). Purine nucleotides
are critical for intramacrophage survival of Salmonella. Under purine-limiting environments like the macrophage phagosome, Salmonella is unable to repair the DNA damage, which ultimately
results in bacterial death.

Significant variations in the amide
III peak were also detected
(Figure 3D) except
for STM-LT2 in MoDCs, possibly due to either intracellular stress
that changes the properties of bacterial proteins and enzymes, or
protein denaturation as a result of bacteria being killed. Indeed,
significant changes in the amide III peak are noticeable during Mf
infection, in agreement with the decreased bacterial survival (Figure S3) and metabolic activity (Figure 2) previously described. Additionally,
a decrease can be observed in STM-D23580 and ST-Ty2 during infection
of MoDCs as compared to STM-LT2, which might contribute to invasive
characteristics of these strains in MoDCs.

Single-Cell
Raman Analysis Resolves Phenotypic Heterogeneity
in Isogenic Populations
Salmonella displayed
significant cell-to-cell variation resulting in distinct subpopulations
with different metabolic phenotypes. A t-distributed stochastic neighbor
embedding (t-SNE) of all bacterial cells in MoDCs and Mf at 2 h p.i.
was used to exemplify and visualize the multimodal behaviors of intracellular
bacteria (Figure S5A). Three subpopulations
were clustered for bacteria in MoDCs (MoDC1, MoDC2, and MoDC3) and
Mf (Mf1, Mf2, and Mf3).

Bacteria in the MoDC3 cluster was enriched
in lipid content while displaying low levels of carbohydrates (Figure S5B). This metabolic phenotype is compatible
with that of bacteria restricted to phagosomal compartments, in which
glucose is less available and alternative carbon sources are required.38 The NO produced in the SCV targets the pyruvate
and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes, which would strongly
affect glycolysis, glycogenesis, and the TCA cycle.39 The higher lipid content, on the other hand, suggests the
employment of alternative energy pathways.

MoDC3 and Mf3 clusters
also had a low TUFA/TFA ratio. When exposed
to acidic pH, such as in the SCV, Salmonella induces
a profound rearrangement of lipid membranes by increasing the unsaturated
fatty acids content.40 On the contrary,
the higher TUFA/TFA ratio, observed for the bacteria in the clusters
MoDC2 and Mf2, could suggest continuous internal turnover, damage,
and/or loss to the environment, which has previously been proposed
as a potential strategy adopted by the persisters.41

Diversity in proliferation is also observed in different
bacterial
groups. A low DNA/RNA contents and NAs/protein ratio was observed
for the bacteria of the “intraphagosomal” clusters MoDC3
and Mf3. In fact, under particular stress conditions, such as the
presence of NO, Salmonella cell division is reduced.
High protein-specific peak intensities indicate an increase in protein
synthesis, which may be required for the correct assembly of the type
II secretion system (T2SS) machinery.42 On the other hand, bacteria in the clusters of MoDC1, MoDC2, Mf1,
and Mf2 exhibit a different metabolic profile characterized by high
content of carbohydrates and nucleic acids concomitant with a reduced
TUFA/TFA ratio.

The Mf3 population is bigger than MoDC3, suggesting
that a more
efficient compartmentalization of Salmonella in the
SCV could be achieved by Mf. Previous studies have indicated that
the intracellular lifestyle of Salmonella in MoDCs
differs from that in Mf,34,43 implying that Salmonella’s gene expression required for survival
inside MoDCs is not the same as the one needed for survival in Mf.
Diverse adaptations and isogeneic heterogeneity within different host
compartments in cell lines and primary human cells highlights the
importance of choosing single-cell tools and different cell infection
models for the study of intracellular pathogens.

Intracellular
Raman Profiles Are Consistent with the Proteomic
Analysis
In order to validate the Raman observations, we
performed time-course proteomics experiments of intracellular Salmonella recovered from MoDCs, which are the most important
antigen-presenting cells. We identified 687 proteins in STM-LT2, 1277
proteins in STM-D23580, and 1408 proteins in ST-Ty2 (Figure S6). For each bacterial strain, differentially expressed
proteins (DEPs; p < 0.05) were determined across
the time points. Those DEPs were then functionally annotated to bacterial
pathways related to either energy metabolism (Figures S7A and S8A-C) or biosynthesis (Figures S7B and S8D-F).

Carbon metabolism and energy
utilization are key to all bacterial metabolic events. We therefore
hypothesize that regulation in energy pathways could support the observation
that the three Salmonella strains demonstrate distinctive
metabolism rates by Raman-DIP. In Figure S7A, most of the proteins related to bacterial energy pathways were
upregulated during the intracellular life of STM-LT2 except for those
responsible for glycolysis and fermentation. STM-D23580 exhibited
a mixture of upregulated and downregulated pathways. All pathways
related to energy metabolism had a decreasing trend in ST-Ty2. This
is in a good agreement with the Raman-DIP results, indicating that
the invasive typhoidal ST-Ty2 had the lowest metabolic activity among
three Salmonella pathovars (Figure 2), by slowing down most metabolic reactions
to obtain energy and nutrients.

Overall, a downregulation of
many metabolic enzymes in the TCA
cycle is observed in all Salmonella strains (Figure S8A-C), in good agreement with a previous
report,44 including the aminotransferase
AspC, the NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase GdhA, the succinyl-CoA
synthetases SucC and SucD, and AcnA and AcnB. The inactivation of
the TCA cycle increases the ability of Salmonella to survive within resting and activated murine macrophages,45 which might explain the prominent disruption
of TCA cycle and aerobic respiration in STM-D23580 and ST-Ty2 (Figure S7A). This result supports the dynamic
Raman profiling in MoDCs, where a significant consumption of carbon
stock (carbohydrates III) was observed in STM-LT2, while higher consumption
of lipids occurred in STM-D23580 and ST-Ty2 (Figure 3A). These results highlight a possible strategy
adopted by the invasive strains to survive intracellularly: switching
energy sources from aerobic respiration to lipid-driven metabolisms.
This conclusion is also supported by a decrease in lipid biosynthesis
pathway in STM-LT2, STM-D23580, and ST-Ty2 (Figure S7B).

Biosynthesis pathways related to amino acids (AA),
amine, and polyamine
were found to be differentially regulated (Figure S7B). While proteins associated with glutamine and lysine synthesis
were upregulated at final time points in STM-LT2 (STM1795 and DapD),
proteins associated with these pathways (e.g., STM1795, Gln A, ThrA, IlvC, IlvD, DapA, and DapD) were detected at significantly
lower level at 6 h, as compared to the initial stage of the infection,
in STM-D23580 and ST-Ty2 (Figure S8D-F).
Overall, AA biosynthesis was more repressed in STM-D23580 and ST-Ty2
during the infection, as a significant decrease of amide III was observed
in the invasive strains while nonsignificant changes were detected
in STM-LT2 (Figure 3B). Similarly, more evidently reduced abundance of nucleosides and
nucleotides (NN) synthesis proteins was observed in STM-D23580 and
ST-Ty2 (Figure S7B), similar to marked
decreasing DNA/RNA bands in the Raman profile of the invasive strains
(Figure 3C).

The Fad-family proteins are known to be the key players in the
metabolism of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids and are indicative
of a modulation of bacterial membrane fluidity in response to environmental
stress.46 While all Fab proteins were downregulated
in STM-D23580 and ST-Ty2, STM-LT2 exhibited an increased abundance
of FabB and FabG, responsible for the de novo synthesis of UFA via
the fabA-fabB pathway46,47(Figure S8D-F). This suggests variability
in the membrane composition between the invasive strains and the noninvasive
strain, verified by the markedly increased Raman TUFA/TFA ratio in
STM-LT2 (Figure 3B).

Conclusions
In this study, we employed a single-cell Raman
technique to detect
the different metabolic profiles of typhoidal S.
typhi Ty2 and the nontyphoidal S. Typhimurium LT2
and D23580. By using Raman-DIP and reverse labeling, we were able
to characterize the metabolic activity of the three different Salmonella strains during infection of human cell lines
and primary monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) and macrophages
(Mf). In a paradox, ST-Ty2 had the fastest extracellular metabolic
rate but the slowest metabolic rate inside immune cells. Our study
also revealed a decreased uptake of carbohydrate stocks but increased
lipid consumption in both invasive STM-D23580 and ST-Ty2.

In
summary, we have demonstrated that single-cell Raman-DIP technologies
are capable of revealing metabolic changes, highlighting molecular
heterogeneity and cell-to-cell variations among invasive Salmonella serovars. Through comprehensive profiling and comparison of three
different Salmonella pathovars, this study sheds
light into bacterial metabolic traits and adaptations inside human
host cells, which might contribute to the distinct pathogenicity of Salmonella. As several aspects of metabolism can influence
antimicrobial susceptibility and tolerance, a better understanding
of the Salmonella-host metabolic landscape might
open new perspectives for antimicrobial development.
