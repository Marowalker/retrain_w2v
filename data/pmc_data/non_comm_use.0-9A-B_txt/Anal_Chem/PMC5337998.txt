Microfluidic
stripline NMR technology not only allows for NMR experiments
to be performed on small sample volumes in the submicroliter range,
but also experiments can easily be performed in continuous flow because
of the stripline’s favorable geometry. In this study we demonstrate
the possibility of dual-channel operation of a microfluidic stripline
NMR setup showing one- and two-dimensional 1H, 13C and heteronuclear NMR experiments under continuous flow. We performed
experiments on ethyl crotonate and menthol, using three different
types of NMR chips aiming for straightforward microfluidic connectivity.
The detection volumes are approximately 150 and 250 nL, while flow
rates ranging from 0.5 μL/min to 15 μL/min have been employed.
We show that in continuous flow the pulse delay is determined by the
replenishment time of the detector volume, if the sample trajectory
in the magnet toward NMR detector is long enough to polarize the spin
systems. This can considerably speed up quantitative measurement of
samples needing signal averaging. So it can be beneficial to perform
continuous flow measurements in this setup for analysis of, e.g.,
reactive, unstable, or mass-limited compounds.

==== Body
Nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy is a powerful technique and an important tool for complex
molecular structure determination and mixture analysis in biology
and chemistry. However, because of the inherent low sensitivity of
the technique,1 relatively large amounts
of sample are needed in order to prevent very long signal averaging
for obtaining meaningful spectra. Since the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) of the measurement scales linearly with the number of spins
contributing to the signal but scales only with square root of the
number of scans, for mass limited samples it can become a problem
to achieve sufficient SNR in the time available. Moreover, if the
sample volume does not match the coil volume (typically 500 μL
for commercial NMR probes), substantial dilution of the sample is
needed, and as a consequence the signal of the sample may be obscured
by the signal of the solvent. Furthermore, the composition of the
sample itself should be constant during the acquisition in order to
measure a representative spectrum. In some cases, e.g., for fast reactions
and/or long measurements, such as 2D or 13C experiments
on unstable compounds, changes in composition of the sample during
the total measurement time result in spectra that reflect only an
approximation of the average composition of the sample.

A possible
solution to these problems is miniaturization, as reducing
the diameter of the NMR coil increases the sensitivity per amount
of spins.1,2 Therefore, since the introduction of the
first solenoidal microcoils3,4 and the first planar
microcoils,5 microcoils are an extensively
explored topic in NMR research.6−10 In the past decade, several approaches to microscale NMR include
solenoid coils,11−13 planar coils,14,15 Helmholtz coils,16 and striplines/microslots.17−22

Microcoils are not only more suited for measuring mass-limited
samples, but depending on the design, also in situ measurements in
a microfluidic setup are facilitated. In this contribution we investigate
the use of stripline NMR microcoils coupled to a standard microfluidic
setup for continuous flow NMR. Microfluidic continuous flow NMR can
be of importance in chemistry,23 where
in-line analysis can be advantageous especially in applications where
samples are unstable or in quantitative high-throughput analysis.
Another approach in microfluidic NMR is remote detection NMR,24−26 where separation of encoding and detection steps results in a higher
sensitivity. Some applications of microfluidic NMR focus on in situ
monitoring of reaction kinetics (including 2D structural analysis,
e.g., in synthetic chemistry, metabolic studies, drug delivery), continuous
flow quality control, and fast quantitative analysis (unbiased for
samples with long relaxation times). Also, microfluidic NMR enables
the hyphenation of NMR to chromatographic separation techniques.3,27−29 The monitoring of chemical reactions has successfully
been performed in a microcoil NMR setup by several groups.13,30−33 The small volumes permits an efficient use of solvents, which is
less expensive, e.g., when deuterated solvents are used, and environmentally
friendly because of the low solvent consumption. When a mass-limited
sample can be completely dissolved in the small microcoil detection
volume, one can work with higher analyte concentrations than when
using the larger conventional NMR detection volume. When using higher
analyte concentration, methods, such as solvent suppression, become
easier. It should be noted that if sufficient sample with a fixed
concentration is available, conventional NMR gives a higher sensitivity,
but for a limited amount of sample the sensitivity is better for the
smallest coil matching the sample volume.1,34

The stripline resonator is a straight flat wire that is used to
generate and detect the radio frequency (rf) fields in the NMR experiments.
The stripline NMR chip is manufactured using microfabrication techniques
such as photolithography, electroplating, and wet chemical etching.

The ground planes (“shields”) surrounding the stripline
enclose the generated rf B1 field. The
boundary conditions imposed by the ground planes arrange the field
lines parallel to the stripline surface, as a result the B1 field is homogeneous, which is crucial for complex pulse
sequences. The sample volume is scaled down to 150 nL in the design
used in the present study. Standard microfluidics can be connected
to the stripline NMR chip, making it possible to continuously flow
the sample during acquisition. Continuous-flow or recycled-flow NMR35,36 can be advantageous, for example, for samples that have long relaxation
times, mass-limited samples, or unstable samples.

The stripline
design is scalable, so one can use an optimal volume
for each specific application. We have previously shown the application
of this setup for real-time monitoring of fast chemical reactions,
acquiring steady state 1H signals during the first minutes
of the reaction.37 Furthermore, the upright
geometry of the stripline is particularly convenient for realizing
a flow setup with straight capillaries running through the probehead.

Proton NMR spectra are very information-rich as such. However,
more detailed information can be obtained from two-dimensional (2D)
NMR, 13C NMR, and/or heteronuclear NMR experiments. Investigating
the correlations within the molecules and the surrounding of the carbon
nuclei is of considerable use in molecular structure determination.
Particularly for the analysis of mass-limited complex molecules or
mixtures, the addition of an X-channel is a very useful feature. Here,
the possibility to add flow is particularly helpful to overcome SNR
issues due to long T1 relaxation times
of X-nuclei compared to 1H spins. Finally, for in situ
monitoring of fast reactions the higher resolution of, e.g., 13C spectra can be a valuable asset. In this paper we demonstrate,
as a proof of principle, some common 1H 2D, 13C, and heteronuclear NMR experiments during flow of the model compounds
ethyl crotonate and menthol in a microfluidic stripline probe.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
Ethyl crotonate (99%) and menthol (99%) were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification.
Chloroform-d3 + 0.05%v/v TMS (Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories,
Inc.) was used as a solvent. A 20 vol % ethyl crotonate solution in
chloroform-d3 (1.6 M) and a 30 vol % menthol solution in
chloroform-d3 (2 M) were used for the stripline NMR flow
experiments. For the 13C channel, pulse length and decoupling
parameters were set up by using a 1 M d-glucose-1-13C (CAMPRO Scientific, Veenendaal, The Netherlands) solution in D2O.

Stripline rf-Coil
The stripline
rf-coil17,20 consists of a copper strip through which
the radio frequency (rf)
current runs (see the pictures in Figure 1). In the middle part of the chip, the width
of the strip is constricted to 0.6 mm (for a section of 3 mm length)
in order to enhance the rf field strength in this area and therefore
localize detection to this area. The boundaries of the resonator are
formed by flat copper shielding layers parallel to the strip, so the
magnetic field lines are arranged parallel to the surface. In the
region of homogeneous and high B1 field,
two microfluidic microchannels run along both sides of the strip.
In the experiments described here, only one of the microchannels is
used; however, the other microchannel can be used, e.g., for a reference
sample or D2O for the locking of the NMR spectrometer.

Figure 1 NMR stripline
chips used in this study: chip a, chip b, and chip
c.

The stripline chips a, b, and
c used in the present work are displayed
in Figure 1, and the
design differs from the design that was described in our previous
work.20 Technical details can be found
in the Supporting Information. The design
of chips a and c was motivated by aiming for straightforward connection
of microfluidics and a higher filling factor. The substrates are borosilicate
glass into which the microchannels are etched in such a way that optimal
use is made of the space between stripline and shielding. The inlet
and outlet are positioned on the top and bottom of the chips and flow
is enabled by fused silica (FS) capillaries glued into the chip, which
ensures a convenient microfluidic connection. Chip c, which has a
detection volume of approximately 215 nL, was fabricated first; however,
it did not give as good sensitivity results as expected. Chip a was
made from thinner substrates in order to make a smaller detection
volume of 165 nL. The sensitivity improved, but unfortunately the
chip turned out to be fragile, so that leakages occurred in the substrate
itself as well as in the connecting capillaries. For chip b, FS substrates
are used, because this material has a better dielectric performance,
so that dielectric losses from the substrate that affect the sensitivity
can be avoided. Chip b was designed to be more robust, with a diced
channel which contains a separate and replacable FS capillary with
standard dimensions to make leak-proof and simple connection to a
microfluidic setup or use of a sample plug in the capillary, so that
a detection volume up to 145 nL results. The observation factor is
the fraction of the sample volume from which the NMR signal is observed,34 which is high when sample plugs are used, since
up to 100% of the sample can be placed in the detection volume. However,
the filling factor, defined as the part of the detection volume which
is occupied by the observed part of the sample,34 is lower in chip b as the space between stripline and shielding
is not as efficiently used as in chips a and c. The spectral resolution
obtained with chip b is not as good as expected, which is attributed
to irregularities in the microfluidic channel resulting from the dicing
procedure. Nevertheless, considering the benefits of the design of
chip b, it is worthwhile to explore the possibilities of this chip,
e.g., the chip is directly accessible from the outside allowing not
only flow experiments, but it is also possible to use a piece of capillary
as a tiny NMR tube for mass-limited samples. Since having a high resolution
is not as critical in 13C NMR measurements as in 1H NMR measurements, in this work we demonstrate chip b for the 13C experiments. Descriptions of the fabrication of chips a
and c are given in ref (38) and of chip b in the Supporting Information.

The stripline chips can be placed in one of two homebuild
probes;
a single resonance probe with a 1H channel and a double
resonance probe with a 1H channel and a variable frequency
X-channel. In order to enable continuous flow, a syringe pump is attached
to the inlet and outlet capillaries via standard microfluidic components.
Information regarding the probeheads and microfluidics can be found
in the Supporting Information.

Acquisition
and Processing
The spectra were taken at
room temperature on a VNMRS 600 MHz Varian NMR spectrometer with VNMRJ
software. MatNMR39 was used for data processing
and plotting, and ACD/NMR Processor (Advanced Chemistry Development,
Inc.)40 was used for plotting of the correlation
spectra.

Results and Discussion
Practical Considerations
An important feature of in
situ microfluidic NMR measurements is that by continuously flowing
the sample through the detection volume during acquisition, the spins
that have received an rf pulse are continuously replaced by spins
with thermal equilibrium polarization that have not yet received an
rf pulse. The apparent relaxation delays of the experiment are affected,
as both the observed spin–lattice relaxation time (T1obs) and the observed spin–spin relaxation time (T2obs) decrease.35,41,42 The stationary value of T1 reflects the time constant for the spins to
return to thermal equilibrium after receiving an rf pulse, which poses
limitations on the repetition rate. However, when the analyte flows
through the detection area during acquisition, the spins can be refreshed
faster than the stationary value of T1, the acquisition delay between scans can be shortened. In effect,
measurement time can be decreased by using continuous flow during
acquisition for samples with long T1 relaxation
times. At a moderate flow rate of 5 μL/min, the detection volume
of 150 nL is refreshed in almost 2 s, whereas for the 215 nL detection
volume it takes 3 s to completely replenish the detection volume.
At a flow rate of 15 μL/min, this retention time decreases to
0.6 and 1 s, respectively. The repetition rate of the scans can be
increased and thereby the signal-to-noise ratio per unit time. Here
it is assumed that the sample flows linearly through the channel,
but in reality a more complicated flow profile arises because of the
laminar pressure-driven flow. The part of the sample close to the
walls of the capillary has a lower flow rate because of the parabolic
Poiseuille flow profile, while the center part has a higher flow rate.
This might affect the accuracy of quantifiability of the experiments.

From the moment the analyte flows into the magnet until the detection
scan in the stripline, polarization build-up takes place. When the
flow rate increases, the time in the magnet is shortened and it is
important to verify that the time for polarization build-up is long
enough to reach the thermal equilibrium polarization. In order to
fully polarize the spins in the sample, a build-up time of 5T1 is needed. In our setup the sample flows through
a 250 μm i.d. capillary of approximately 60 cm long before arriving
at the stripline. At the highest used flow rate of 15 μL/min,
the build-up time is still 37.5 s, long enough for most spins in our
samples to achieve thermal equilibrium polarization. A longer build-up
time can easily be established by increasing the volume of the analyte
inside the magnet before reaching the stripline, e.g., by using a
longer capillary trajectory inside the magnet toward the NMR detector.

Flowing the sample out of the detection area during acquisition
can result in line broadening, since the recorded free induction decay
(FID) is shortened by nuclear spins flowing out of the detection area
during acquisition. When the residence time of spins in the detection
coil decreases, the effective decay time of the FID decreases, so
that the observed relaxation time T2obs decreases as well.42 The observed relaxation time depends on the
residence time τ and the stationary value of the relaxation
time T2stat: . For the smallest detection volume (145
nL) and the highest flow rates (15 μL/min), an estimated increase
of ∼0.4 Hz can be expected for line widths of approximately
3 Hz (full-width at half-maximum). In the present setup and for the
used flow rates, this broadening effect does not significantly affect
the spectra. A broadening of 1 Hz, i.e., from 3 to 4 Hz, would be
expected at flow rates of approximately 30 μL/min.

One-Dimensional 1H and 13C Spectra
NMR measurements can
be performed, while the solution is flowing
at constant flow rate through the stripline microchannel. The proton
spectra of ethyl crotonate and menthol during flow are shown in Figure
S5 in the Supporting Information. The spectra
can be assigned in agreement with the literature.43,44 We find a resolution of 2.8 Hz for ethyl crotonate and 2.7 Hz for
menthol (measured full-width half-maximum). No significant line broadening
due to flow was observed for the employed flow rates.

We tested
the 13C channel of the HX dual channel probe with chip
b. The experiments were first optimized using a 1 M 13C-labeled d-glucose-1-13C solution. The 90° pulse was
found to be 3.5 μs using 240 W rf power. The decoupler is set
to 2W WALTZ-16 proton-decoupling with NOE enhancement. To determine
the sensitivity of the 13C channel, a spectrum accumulating
1000 scans was acquired for this test sample, from which a signal-to-noise
ratio of 0.5 for a single scan was deduced. This corresponds to a
limit of detection (LOD) of approximately 1 · 1015 spins/ for the 13C nuclei, defined
by the number of spins needed in 1 Hz bandwidth in order to obtain
a signal-to-noise ratio of 1.17

After finding the optimal pulse and decoupling
settings, stopped
flow 13C measurements of ethyl crotonate (20 vol %) and
menthol (30%) were successfully performed, as displayed in Figure 2. Relaxation times T1 can be very long for 13C nuclei,
for protonated carbon atoms the values lie typically in the range
from 0.1–10 s, whereas quaternary carbon atoms have values
ranging from 10 up to 300 s.45

Figure 2 13C measurements using stopped flow or continuous flow
in (a) ethyl crotonate (20 vol %) and (b) menthol (30%). The HX dual
channel probe fitted with chip b was employed. Each spectrum was recorded
by accumulating 4096 scans. For increasing flow rates, the repetition
rate was increased using shorter recycle delays and acquisition times.
Ethyl crotonate was measured with a recycle delay of 12 s without
flow, which decreased to 1.5 and 0.5 s, for 5 μL/min and 10
μL/min flow rates, respectively. The acquisition time was 0.25
s for stopped flow and decreased to 0.1 s for the highest flow rate.
Overall, this decreased the experiment time from 14.5 to 1.1 h. Menthol
was measured with an acquisition delay of 12.5 s without flow and
3 and 1.8 s for 2.5 μL/min and 5 μL/min flow rates, respectively.
The acquisition time was 0.25 s for the measurement without flow and
0.1 s for the two measurements in flow. Measurement time decreased
from 15.0 to 2.5 h.

For ethyl crotonate,
we found experimental T1 relaxation times
varying between 6 and 18 s (quaternary carbon
4 in Figure 2a), i.e.,
the relaxation delay in the stopped-flow experiments was too short
to ensure quantitative interpretation of the resonances. In continuous
flow NMR, the sample in the detection volume is completely refreshed
faster than the relaxation time T1, so
the acquisition delay can be shortened and thus the overall measurement
time significantly decreased for slow relaxing nuclei.41 At a flow rate of 10 μL/min, the sample
has been inside of the magnet for 56 s, which is equivalent to 9T1 for the fastest relaxing nuclei (T1 is 6 s) and 3T1 for the
quaternary carbons (T1 is 18 s) of ethyl
crotonate. We measured a spectrum acquiring 4096 scans in 14.5 h using
a delay of 12 s between scans in the case of stopped flow and could
obtain a similar spectrum in 2.8 h at 5 μL/min flow rate and
in 1.1 h at 10 μL/min flow rate using a recycle delay of 1.5
and 0.5 s, respectively. During continuous flow, the line widths of
the peaks increased from approximately 4 Hz in the stopped flow spectra
to around 7–8 Hz under continuous flow conditions. The 13C T1 values for menthol varied
from 2 to 6 s. The stationary (stopped flow) measurement of 4096 scans
took 15.0 h with a delay of 12.5 s, whereas this took only 4 h at
a flow rate of 2.5 μL/min and 2.5 h at a flow rate of 5 μL/min,
using a delay of 1.8 s. As a measure of accuracy of the experiments,
the peaks in the spectra have been integrated after peak deconvolution
of the baseline corrected spectra. The standard deviations for the
peaks are 8%, 9%, and 10%, respectively, for the menthol spectra acquired
at flow rates of 5 μL/min, 2.5 μL/min, and stopped flow.
The standard deviations for the peaks of ethyl crotonate are 36%,
10%, and 12% for the experiments using flow rates of 10 μL/min,
5 μL/min, and stopped flow.

In order to obtain quantitative
results, all spins in the detection
volume should be fully polarized, i.e., have been in the magnetic
field for 3–5 T1 before a pulse
is applied, to fully contribute contribute to the signal. In these
experiments, the repetition rate is somewhat higher than the time
for completely refreshing the detection volume. Furthermore, the laminar
Poiseuille flow profile causes a variation in the velocity of the
flow that may cause a small decrease in the intensity for nuclei with
a T1 larger than the recycle delay. However,
this is only observed for peak 4 of ethyl crotonate, the T1 value of this quaternary carbon is 18 s, which is much
larger than the repetition rate. The other carbon atoms of ethyl crotonate
have T1 values of around 6–7 s,
and no effect of decreasing intensity with changing flow rate is found.
The T1 values of menthol are around 6
s for three of the nuclei and around 3 s for the rest. In the stopped
flow experiment, the peaks of carbon atoms with a shorter T1 have a higher intensity (averaged 105%) than
the peaks of carbon atoms with a longer T1 (averaged 90%). For the measurements in continuous flow, this difference
is not present.

The average value of the SNR (defined by the
peak height divided
by the rms (root-mean-square) of the noise over a 200 Hz bandwidth)
of all peaks in the spectrum except quaternary carbon peak 4 is 10.6
for the stopped flow experiment and increases to 15.2 and 13.5 for
the spectra measured in 5 and 10 μL/min flow rates, respectively.
The lowest intensity peaks have an SNR of 8.5, 12.1, and 10.0 for
the stopped flow, 5, and 10 μL/min flow measurements, meaning
that if we aimed for an SNR of at least 10 the spectra could have
been obtained in 20 h, 2 h, or 1 h under the given flow conditions.

For menthol, the average SNR measured in stopped flow was 9.3,
which increased under continuous flow conditions to 13.1 and 16.0
for 2.5 and 5 μL/min flow, respectively. The lowest measured
SNR was 8.0, 10.5, and 13.5 for stopped flow, 2.5, and 5 μL/min
flow, so that a spectrum with a minimum SNR of 10 could have been
measured in 23.5 h, 3.5 h, and 1.4 h, respectively.

Applying
continuous flow during the acquisition consumed 750 μL
for experiments using 2.5 μL/min and 5 μL/min flow rate
and 600 μL for the experiments using 10 μL/min flow rate.
Clearly a setup flowing in fresh sample continuously, as in the current
setup, is not feasible for mass-limited samples. In that case, flow
NMR is still feasible but with a small storage volume close to the
stripline. The size of the storage volume for optimal SNR is then
a trade-off between sample availability and length of T1stat.

We did not further increase the flow rate to speed up the measurement
because it was experimentally observed that a delay between scans
is needed to take into account the decoupling period before acquisition
and the duty cycle of the decoupler to prevent heating of the detection
area of the chip.

Finally, it has to be noted that the resolution
obtained with chip
b is suboptimal, probably because of susceptibility broadening, which
is attributed to imperfections in the microchannel as a result from
the dicing procedure disturbing the B0 homogeneity. It is expected that a modification to the stripline
NMR chip fabrication process which avoids the dicing procedure will
result in a more homogeneous B0 field,
so that a higher spectral resolution can be achieved. This will further
enhance the effective signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra, so that
the experimental time to achieve the same SNR at a given resolution
can be further decreased.

Two Dimensional Correlation Spectroscopy
For structural
elucidation, two-dimensional NMR is a valuable addition to the one-dimensional
NMR experiments. Common experiments are correlation spectroscopy (COSY46) and total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY47). Both experiments show correlations of proton
spins within the molecule. A COSY spectrum shows cross peaks for directly
coupled spins over one or more bonds, whereas a TOCSY spectrum also
can be used for studying longer range couplings depending on the mixing
time.

COSY and TOCSY spectra have been acquired both at low
and high flow rates as shown in Figures 3 and 4. Considering
the small molecules, we used short mixing times (50 ms) with an MLEV1748 spinlock for the TOCSY. The line widths are
around 5 Hz in the F2 dimension and 10 Hz in the F1 dimension for
the TOCSY spectra. For the COSY spectra, however, the cross peaks
are around 30 Hz in the F1 dimension. In COSY experiments, the cross
peaks have an antiphase absorption line shape, while the diagonal
peaks have a broad, dispersion lineshapes. For larger line widths,
the wide tail of the diagonal peak may obscure the cross peaks and
the intensity of the cross peaks may be diminished due to the antiphase
lineshapes. Cancelation of the cross peaks can arise from these lineshapes
and is a known disadvantage of COSY experiments.43 TOCSY experiments do not suffer from these cancelation
effects for broad lines and are therefore more preferred. So it is
interesting to perform TOCSY experiments in the stripline chip, especially
in the case of unstable samples or reaction monitoring in continuous
flow, if the sample is not stable during the acquisition time of two-dimensional
NMR experiments in conventional NMR. Alternatively, mass-limited samples
can be measured in a static plug in a FS capillary in chip b, as described
before.

Figure 3 Continuous flow COSY measurements at (a) 15 μL/min flow rate
for ethyl crotonate (20 vol %) and (b) at 1 μL/min flow rate
for menthol (30%), performed in the 1H probe fitted with
chip a. Both spectra were taken accumulating 4 scans for 256 t1-increments. A relaxation delay of 1 s was
taken into account for ethyl crotonate (20 vol %) using 15 μL/min
flow and 2 s for menthol (30%) at a flow rate of 1 μL/min. The
experiment time was 30 min for ethyl crotonate and 47 min for menthol.
Zero filling up to 8192 × 4096 points and a line broadening of
3 Hz for the direct dimension and 5 Hz for the indirect dimension
was applied for ethyl crotonate and 1 Hz broadening and a sine-function
for menthol.

Figure 4 Continuous flow TOCSY
measurements, at a flow rate of (a) 1 μL/min
for ethyl crotonate and (b) 15 μL/min for menthol, performed
in the 1H probe fitted with chip a. (a) 4 scans for 512 t1-increments were acquired for ethyl crotonate
(20 vol %) and (b) 4 scans and 256 increments for menthol (30%). For
ethyl crotonate, an acquisition delay of 3 s was taken into account.
The experiment time was 4 h and 20 min. For menthol the acquisition
delay was 1 s and the experiment time was 1 h and 30 min. For both
experiments, a mixing time of 50 ms, using an MLEV17 spinlock and
a trim pulse of 2 ms was used. Zero-filling up to 8192 × 2048
and a line broadening of 1 Hz was applied in both directions.

Finally, double-resonance experiments
can be performed in the dual-channel
probe providing relevant structural information. Heteronuclear multiple-quantum
correlation spectroscopy (HMQC)49 correlates
proton and carbon spins that are directly coupled. After establishing
the optimal decoupling and pulse length parameters on d-glucose-1-13C, HMQC experiments were performed for both model compounds
using low (0.5 μL/min) and medium (7 μL/min) flow rates
(Figure 5). The experimental
time for the measurement of ethyl crotonate at a 7 μL/min flow
rate was 25 h with a consumption of 10 mL solution. The menthol spectrum
was obtained in 69 h, consuming 2 mL of solution (at 0.5 μL/min).

Figure 5 HMQC spectra
of (a) ethyl crotonate (20 vol %) and (b) menthol
(30%) with flow rates of 7 μL/min for ethyl crotonate and 0.5
μL/min for menthol, performed in the HX channel probe and chip
c. We acquired 400 scans for 64 increments for ethyl crotonate and
512 scans with 128 increments for menthol. The acquisition delays
were 1 and 1.2 s, respectively, and a BIRD delay of 0.6 and 0.5 s.
The pulse sequence delays were adjusted to a one-bond 1H–13C coupling constant of 145 Hz.

Comparison of the Chips
Good resolution
and sensitivity
are crucial in obtaining informative NMR spectra. Since the copper
stripline structure is defined with the same geometry (i.e., a 3 mm
long constriction) in each of the chips employed in this study, the
results can be directly compared to give information about their performance.

The sensitivity of the stripline NMR chip has a substantial effect
on the efficiency of the measurement, i.e., the signal-to-noise ratio
in the spectrum obtained per unit time. A good measure of sensitivity
is the limit of detection (LOD), defined as the number of spins needed
in 1 Hz bandwidth in order to obtain a signal-to-noise ratio of 1.17 The LOD for protons (LODH) is measured
from a single-scan ethanol free-induction-decay (FID). For proton
detection in chips a and b, we found a similar LODH of , respectively, whereas for chip c, a LODH of  was found. The significantly lower detection
limit (LODH) of chips a and b indicates a higher sensitivity
of these chips compared to the sensitivity of chip c. The theoretically
expected LODH is around  for all chips but does not take into account
dielectric losses due to the substrate (which can be rather large
due to inclusion of, e.g., metal-oxide impurities); therefore, the
low sensitivity of chip c is attributed to the nonoptimal substrate.38

In terms of resolution, chip a in Figure 1 was found to perform
best with a line width
of less than 3 Hz for the 1H spectra. In the single-scan
spectra of ethyl crotonate and menthol, we find for ethyl crotonate
the following line widths (full-width half-maximum): chip a 2.7 Hz,
chip b 7 Hz, chip c 9 Hz (estimated via deconvolution of the multiplets).
Similar results were estimated from the menthol spectra, where due
to overlapping peaks could not be as precisely defined. Another comparison
of the spectral resolution can be made from a single-scan spectrum
of ethanol (70%), having the advantage that since the concentration
is high a large signal is obtained; therefore, the shimming procedure
is uncomplicated. For single-scan ethanol (70%) spectra, the best
resolution of chip a is approximately 2 Hz, for chips b and c the
line width is around 3 Hz. The peak shape of chip b, however, contains
a broad foot structure and other irregularities.

The signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) in the spectrum obviously depends
on the amount of sample (concentration per unit volume vs total volume)
but is also affected by the LOD and resolution provided by each chip.
For ethyl crotonate, the SNR is calculated from the single scan 1H spectrum using the methyl group 6 in Figure S5a, resulting in 1080 for chip a, 168 for chip b,
and 446 for chip c. For menthol, we find for chip a 3308, for chip
b 238, and chip c 313 calculated using the resonances of the methyl
groups 8 and 10 in Figure S5b. In conclusion,
the SNR for chip a is significantly better than the SNR for chips
b and c. Furthermore, we find that although the detection limit (LODH) of chip b is only slightly higher than for chip a, in the
spectrum a relatively low SNR is found. The lower SNR in the spectrum
is attributed to the loss of signal in the broad foot of the peaks
and the relatively low spectral resolution, which decreases the intensity
of the signal in the spectrum.

Overall, chip a gives the best
results, combining a high resolution
with high sensitivity. Currently, work is in progress to improve the
performance of chip b, as according to theoretical calculations it
should be possible to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in the spectrum
by an order of magnitude. The design of chip b would enable easier
measurement of small volume samples, since a sample plug can be positioned
offline in the exchangeable FS capillary.

Approach for Mass-Limited
Samples
For mass-limited
samples, it is necessary to decrease the total sample volume that
is used; therefore, we currently investigate the use of a recycled-flow50 system using a micropump. For example, a HMQC
experiment on menthol accumulating 512 scans and 128 t1 increments, such as shown in Figure 5b, could be performed in recycled-flow at
a flow rate of 15 μL/min, taking into account a T1 of 30 s. When the time between measurement on the same
part of the sample is set to T1, the loop
would need to contain approximately 7.5 μL, which corresponds
to an amount of 15 μmol of menthol in our experiment. Decreasing
the flow rate can further reduce the required sample volume, but the
acquisition delay between scans has to be longer to account for T1, which implies that the total experiment takes
longer. In turn, a smaller acquisition delay would decrease the amount
of sample that is necessary, since measurement of the same sample
can be repeated faster.

Alternatively, for very small amounts
of sample, it can be advantageous to concentrate all of the sample
in a single plug, i.e., a droplet of concentrated sample covering
the detection area embedded in a nonmixable buffer solution. This
can easily be accomplished using chip b (Figure 1). Since the single-scan signal-to-noise
ratio increases by concentrating the sample, measurement time can
be reduced. Depending on the limitations in amount and solubility
of the sample, measurement time, and T1, one can optimize the setup using a recycled flow sample loop with
a micropump or concentrating the sample in a single plug.

Conclusions
In the work presented here, we successfully performed the most
common experiments that are used to elucidate structures of small
organic molecules, 1H NMR and 13C NMR as well
as homonuclear and heteronuclear correlation spectroscopy, in the
stripline microfluidic NMR probe under continuous flow conditions.

Acquiring spectra in continuous flow made it possible to perform 13C NMR experiments on two test compounds, ethyl crotonate
and menthol, in a drastically decreased measurement time. The two-dimensional
correlation spectra showed all expected peaks with no observed differences
between low and high flow rates (1 and 15 μL/min, respectively).
COSY and TOCSY spectra were successfully acquired for both compounds.
The HMQC spectra that were obtained in continuous flow accurately
showed the expected proton–carbon correlations.

The concentrations
of stock solutions that were used are high (1.6
and 2.0 M), but still the plug the size of the 150 nL detection volume
contains only 0.3 μmol of compound. This amount of compound,
when dissolved in a 500 μL of solution, corresponds to a 0.5
mM solution in a conventional NMR tube. Considering the good signal-to-noise
ratios of the proton spectra, lower concentrated samples can easily
be measured on the proton channel of our setup.

Possible ways
to further shorten the experiment time and/or sample
volume are increasing the sample concentration and using the sample
very efficiently in a sample plug or a recycled-flow system. The design
of chip b as displayed in Figure 1 features a removable FS capillary, in which the sample
can be positioned by hand as an alternative to continuous flow conditions.
This design would therefore be perfectly suited for the measurement
of concentrated sample plugs or for measuring a very small sample
without the need for dilution. Moreover, a microflow system could
be attached to the sample capillary straightforwardly. However, more
work is needed to optimize the resolution of this chip design.

In conclusion, the results show that various stripline setups are
suitable for experiments on mass-limited samples as well as for fast
chemical reactions or otherwise unstable samples and can be advantageously
performed in situ during flow. Attractive applications for continuous
flow stripline NMR include monitoring of reaction kinetics, quality
control, and fast quantitative analysis. Measuring in continuous flow
can also be beneficial for obtaining 13C spectra of samples
with very long 13C relaxation times, since in that case
the detection volume can be refreshed much faster than the relaxation
time.
