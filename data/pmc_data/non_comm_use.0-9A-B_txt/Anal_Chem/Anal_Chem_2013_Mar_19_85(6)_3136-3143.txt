The integration of disparate data
types provides a more complete
picture of complex biological systems. Here we combine small-volume
metabolomic and transcriptomic platforms to determine subtle chemical
changes and to link metabolites and genes to biochemical pathways.
Capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry (CE–MS)
and whole-genome gene expression arrays, aided by integrative pathway
analysis, were utilized to survey metabolomic/transcriptomic hippocampal
neurochemistry. We measured changes in individual hippocampi from
the mast cell mutant mouse strain, C57BL/6 KitW-sh/W-sh. These mice have a
naturally occurring mutation in the white spotting locus that causes
reduced c-Kit receptor expression and an inability of mast cells to
differentiate from their hematopoietic progenitors. Compared with
their littermates, the mast cell-deficient mice have profound deficits
in spatial learning, memory, and neurogenesis. A total of 18 distinct
metabolites were identified in the hippocampus that discriminated
between the C57BL/6 KitW-sh/W-sh and control mice. The combined analysis of metabolite and
gene expression changes revealed a number of altered pathways. Importantly,
results from both platforms indicated that multiple pathways are impacted,
including amino acid metabolism, increasing the confidence in each
approach. Because the CE–MS and expression profiling are both
amenable to small-volume analysis, this integrated analysis is applicable
to a range of volume-limited biological systems.

==== Body
Multiple
analytical approaches
have been combined and used to better understand chemically complex
biological processes, yielding important insights on how chemistry
and biology relate to function and disease state. The integration
of metabolomics and transcriptomics has proven particularly useful
when studying the central nervous system (CNS), which is characterized
by heterogeneous cell types and complex behavioral phenotypes. Metabolomic
studies delineate the small molecule content of a given sample to
reveal differences between sample types or physiological states, especially
with regard to disease.1−3 These measurements have been helpful in a variety
of applications, such as determining molecular differences in brain
tumors4 and characterizing the molecular
composition of single neurons.5−7 Transcriptomic analyses are indispensable
in brain research; for example, gene expression has been characterized
in different cell types in the brain, including neurons, astrocytes,
and oligodendrocytes.8 Continuous progress
in these fields has made both metabolomics and transcriptomics adaptable
to small-volume samples, such as defined regions in the CNS.5,9 The combination of metabolomic and transcriptomic data should yield
a more complete view of the chemistry of the biological system of
interest.

Here we integrate metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses
to characterize
the chemical heterogeneity of the brain (see experimental workflow
in Figure 1). The objective of our investigation
of the CNS was to examine the chemical contribution of multifunctional
immune system cells to normal and abnormal function. Mast cells are
resident in the brain of mammalian species and have been implicated,
along with microglia, in neuroinflammation.10 In the mouse brain, mast cells are located in and near the hippocampal
formation, a structure known to modulate stress responses. Mast cells
are also well-known for their role in allergic response and, more
recently, have been implicated in additional innate and adaptive immune
responses.11 Furthermore, the population
of brain mast cells fluctuates with behavioral, endocrine, and disease
states.12 Mast cell-deficient mice, bearing
alterations in the Kit gene, have been used in studies
of the biological functions of mast cells.13−15 The c-Kit receptor
(also known as the tyrosine kinase Kit receptor, stem cell growth
factor receptor, or CD117) is a protein encoded by the Kit gene. This cytokine receptor is expressed on the surface of hematopoietic
cells and binds to the stem cell factor (also known as c-Kit ligand).
The reduced c-Kit receptor expression results in abnormalities in
pigmentation and an inability of mast cells to differentiate from
their hematopoietic progenitors.16,17

Figure 1 Schematic for
experimental workflow: metabolomic and transcriptomic
analyses were combined to enable the characterization of related chemical
changes between genotypes.

Using small-volume metabolomic and transcriptomic measurements,
we examined the mast cell mutant mouse, C57BL/6 KitW-sh/W-sh. This mouse strain
has an inversion upstream of the Kit gene that leads
to mast cell deficiency due to a selective reduction of the Kit expression. These mice are fertile but have abnormalities
in splenic myeloid and megakaryocytic hyperplasia. At the behavioral
level, mast cell-deficient KitW-sh/W-sh mice have normal locomotor activity and altered anxiety-like
behavior, spatial learning, and memory compared to their littermates18 and have reduced neurogenesis in the hippocampal
regions bearing mast cells and an altered serotonin chemistry.19 Given that many other cell lineages, including
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, red blood cells, neutrophils,
intestinal pacemaker cells, melanocytes, and germ cells bear the c-Kit
receptor, we sought to examine the metabolic consequences of a mutation
in this receptor in the KitW-sh/W-sh mutant mouse. Because of the role of mast cells in allergy,
we also examined whether allergy induction affected cells in brain
regions populated by mast cells. This biological model is an ideal
candidate for using a combined transcriptomics and metabolomics approach
to better understand how chemistry can relate to function, especially
with regard to the observed behavioral phenotypes.

In order
to understand the impact of the c-Kit mutation on the
overall metabolic state of the hippocampus, we studied hippocampal
chemistry. Taking a systems biology approach, metabolic and cell-to-cell
signaling data were combined with transcriptomic data to focus on
the chemical alterations in the hippocampus of c-Kit mutant mice.
Hippocampi from mast cell-deficient mice (Wsh/Wsh) were compared to those of their heterozygous (Wsh/+) and homozygous
littermates (+/+) using small-volume assays. In one
set of experiments, the relative abundances of more than 40 identified
metabolites were determined in tissue extracts from these three genotypes
using capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled to electrospray ionization
(ESI) mass spectrometry (MS). Because of its nanoliter volume sample
requirements, CE–MS is well suited for the study and determination
of the differences in metabolites while allowing multiple technical
replicates from each sample, even from the small-volume samples that
are obtained from a specific region of individual mouse brain.6,20 This instrumental platform is capable of detection limits of less
than 50 nM, has a large linear dynamic concentration range, is tolerant
of salty samples, and has been implemented in single-cell analyses.

In a separate experiment, transcriptomic data was collected via
total RNA isolation followed by hybridization to whole-genome gene
expression arrays to compare gene expression differences in the hippocampus
between allergen-sensitization or saline-treatment in Wsh/+ and Wsh/Wsh littermates as well as unrelated wild-type (WT) mice. Because
of the integral involvement of mast cells in allergic responses, the
allergy treatment provided additional insight into a potential mast
cell-mediated role in the CNS. The c-Kit mutation caused statistically
significant chemical changes in the mouse hippocampus in multiple
metabolite pathways that were detected by both approaches. Our results
demonstrate the effectiveness of combining CE–MS metabolite
data and transcript data to identify a subset of metabolic pathways
altered by this mutation and confirm the applicability of this approach
to chemically complex small-volume measurements.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
Chemicals and reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO) unless indicated otherwise: 1 × Hank’s
balanced salt solution (HBSS) without phenol red (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA), water (LC-MS grade, Chromosolv), methanol (Optima, Fisher Scientific,
Fair Lawn, NJ), formic acid (99+%, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL),
acetic acid (99+%), 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES) (99.5%), and RNAlater-ICE (Ambion, Austin, TX).

Animals
Animal care and testing protocols were approved
by the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Wsh/Wsh mice (B6.Cg-KitW-sh/HNihrJaeBsmJ) were originally obtained from The Jackson Laboratory
(Bar Harbor, ME) and bred to establish a colony at the Columbia University
animal facility. The Wsh/Wsh mice were crossed
with WT C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory) to generate heterozygous
mice (Wsh/+). Male littermates from Wsh/+ x Wsh/+ crosses were used in these experiments and were also
used to obtain homozygous (+/+) mice with mast cells.
Genotypes were determined based on coat color, as the Wsh mutation causes abnormalities in pigmentation.16 The mutation was confirmed by staining for mast
cells in the brain with toluidine blue as previously described.19 Additional WT mice were purchased (C57BL/6,
Charles River, Wilmington, MA) for the gene expression analysis. Litters
were weaned at 28 days, and mice were housed 2–5 per cage in
transparent plastic bins (36 cm × 20 cm × 20 cm) on a 12:12
light–dark cycle. Cages had corn cob bedding (Bed-o’cobs,
Maumee, OH), and food and water were provided ad libitum.

Sample Preparation for CE–ESI-MS
For the CE–ESI-MS
analysis, male mice (5–6 months of age) were sacrificed by
rapid decapitation and the brains removed from the crania and dissected
in half midsagittally. The left hemisphere was affixed to the vibratome
chuck with Krazy Glue and brain slices (300 μm thick) were sectioned
in HBSS. The left caudal hippocampus was dissected and placed in extraction
solution (50% methanol containing 0.5% (v/v) acetic acid) to yield
a concentration of 20 μL/mg of tissue. This extraction solution
composition has been used successfully for extracting metabolites,
while also preventing degradation.6,7,20 Additionally, the combination of methanol and acidic
pH are sufficient for quenching enzymatic processes.21 These samples were grossly homogenized and then incubated
for 90 min at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 15 000g for 15 min, and the supernatants were transferred to polymerase
chain reaction tubes to better accommodate the sample volume; the
samples were frozen at −80 °C until analysis. Finally,
an internal standard, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES), was added to the sample extracts for a final concentration
of 1 μM. The number of biological replicates was 10 for Wsh/Wsh, 9 for Wsh/+, and 5 for +/+.

CE–ESI-MS
The metabolomics measurements were
performed with a custom-designed CE–ESI-MS instrument platform,
similar to the one previously used6 and
described in detail elsewhere.7,22 Briefly, a sample volume
of 6 nL was hydrodynamically injected into a separation capillary
having the following dimensions: 40 μm inner diameter, 105 μm
outer diameter, and 90 cm in length (Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix,
AZ). The CE conditions used were 20 kV for the separation voltage
and 1% formic acid for the background electrolyte. A coaxial sheath
flow interface was used to hyphenate the CE system to the mass spectrometer.
A sheath flow consisting of 50% methanol with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid
was introduced at a rate of 750 nL/min. Generated ions were measured
by an orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometer (micrOTOF ESI-TOF,
Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA), and tandem MS (MS/MS) experiments
were performed with a high-resolution mass spectrometer (maXis ESI-Qq-TOF,
Bruker Daltonics). Three technical replicates were analyzed for each
sample.

CE–ESI-MS Data Analysis
The molecular content
of the mouse hippocampus extracts was determined via manual data analysis
using the mass spectrometer software, DataAnalysis (Bruker Daltonics).
Extracted ion chromatograms were plotted from m/z 50 to 500 with a 500 mDa window. When an eluting peak
was observed, the accurate mass of the ion was registered and searched
against the Scripps metabolite database, METLIN.23 Accurate mass calculations were performed using a molecular
weight calculator, which is free, downloadable software from the Pacific
Northwest National Laboratory [http://omics.pnl.gov/software/MWCalculator.php]. The MS/MS data obtained from the sample was compared against fragmentation
data listed in METLIN when available. Chemical standards were also
analyzed to improve the confidence of analyte identification by evaluating
the MS/MS data and migration time of these compounds.

Relative
metabolite levels were assessed and compared among hippocampus extracts.
Selected ion electropherograms were generated with a 10 mDa window
for a selected array of metabolites, and the intensities of the detected
peaks were noted. For some high intensity signals, the intensity of
the A + 1 peak was evaluated in addition to the monoisotopic ion to
avoid detection biases due to potential saturation of the detector
in the mass spectrometer. Measured intensities were normalized with
respect to the peak intensity of the internal standard, HEPES. The
normalized peak intensity of each identified analyte was averaged
among the technical replicates, and the obtained values were statistically
evaluated with the Student’s t-test using a two-tailed distribution
with two-sample equal variance (homoscedastic) in Excel (Microsoft,
Redmond, WA). In this work, a calculated p-value
of ≤0.05 was considered to indicate statistically significant
differences between data groups.

Gene Array
For
the gene array studies, mice were sacrificed
by decapitation and brains were rapidly removed from the crania, flash
frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then transferred to a cryostat kept
at −20 °C. Brains were sectioned in the coronal plane
at a thickness of 100 μm. Four hippocampi were dissected out
of two adjacent sections, and tissue was pooled in 0.5 mL of RNAlater-ICE,
precooled to −20 °C. Following storage for 24 h at −20
°C, the RNAlater-ICE was removed and the tissue sample frozen
at −80 °C until further processing. Total RNA was isolated
using RNAqueous Micro RNA (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) isolation
kits. RNA was quantified with a Quant-IT RNA fluorometric assay (Life
Technologies) and checked for integrity using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent,
Palo Alto, CA). The resulting RNA samples were amplified using a conventional in vitro transcription-mediated linear amplification procedure
(MessageAmp II, Life Technologies), reciprocally labeled with AlexaFluor
546 or AlexaFluor 647 (Life Technologies) for induced allergy and
control samples and hybridized to mouse whole-genome gene expression
arrays (SurePrint G3Mouse GE 8x60K Kit, Agilent).

The raw signal
intensity data was filtered for background and technical outliers,
normalized for dye and array effects using the loess normalization procedure implemented by the Bioconductor package affy,24 and compared for differential
gene expression using hypothesis testing statistics similar to those
previously described.25,26 The data were further corrected
for type 2 error using Storey’s false discovery rates (FDR)27 and appropriate statistical packages and subroutines
implemented in R28 and Bioconductor.29 Genes differentially expressed between the groups
were selected at <0.5% FDR (typically one to three expected false-positives
per set) and a more than 2-fold change in expression. Differences
in the genes of interest related to the CE–ESI-MS data were
isolated from the data set, with a specific focus on genes in the
choline and autophagy pathways. The hierarchical clustering was performed
in Spotfire Suite for Functional Genomics (TIBCO Spotfire, Inc., Sommerville,
MA) using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA)
as a clustering method with Euclidean distance as the similarity measure.30

Allergy Induction
For the gene microarray
study, WT
mice and Wsh/+ and Wsh/Wsh littermates were exposed to allergen
or saline treatment. Induction of allergy was performed as previously
described.31 Briefly, mice were injected
with ovalbumin (10 μg; Sigma Aldrich) in Imject Alum (2 mg/mL;
Pierce, Rockford, IL) or with the equivalent volume of saline (0.5
mL) via intraperitoneal injection. After 14 days, mice were challenged
four times every 48 h with an intranasal injection of ovalbumin (10
μg in 8 μL of saline) or saline (8 μL). At a time
of 24 h following the last intranasal injection, the mice were sacrificed.
Trunk blood collected at this time confirmed an increase in Immunoglobulin
E in allergy-treated animals (data not shown).

Safety Considerations
Standard safety protocols were
implemented when handling animals, samples, and solvents. The high
voltage and electrically conductive connections of the CE–ESI-MS
platform were grounded or shielded.

Results and Discussion
The combination of approaches used in this study permits two parallel
analyses of the neurochemical pathways associated with genetic and
metabolic changes that arise in several brain regions of the c-Kit
mutant mouse (Figure 1). These changes were
appreciable in spite of substantial interindividual variation, variation
within individuals over time, and variations in the numbers of mast
cells present. The analytes measured via CE–MS are listed in
Table S1 in the Supporting Information).
A number of global chemical differences were observed between Wsh/Wsh and Wsh/+ and +/+ mice, and additionally
between Wsh/Wsh and Wsh/+ and WT mice (Table S2 in the Supporting Information). It is noteworthy that
at the gross anatomical level, the brains of these mice appear normal,
even though the metabolic evidence from our investigations points
to extensive chemical changes accompanying the mutation. There are
minor differences in volume in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus,
but overall there are no large morphological differences in the hippocampus
of Wsh/Wsh mice as previously reported.19

Metabolomic and Transcriptomic Analyses
Several hundred
distinct ions were detected for each hippocampal sample, but only
those signals that were assigned to specific metabolites with high
confidence using a combination of accurate mass, retention time, and
fragmentation data, and that were detected in most samples were used
in subsequent analyses. Thus, the relative abundances of 42 measured
analytes were determined and statistically evaluated in a pairwise
comparison for the hippocampus extracts from Wsh/Wsh, Wsh/+, and +/+ mice. A total of 20 distinct analytes
exhibited statistically significant differences in relative abundance
(Figure 2), with these molecules consisting
of amino acids, classical neurotransmitters, and nucleosides. In particular,
11 different analytes were present in significantly different amounts
between the Wsh/Wsh and Wsh/+ mice (p-value ≤0.05), including multiple amino acids, choline, nicotinamide,
hypoxanthine, and carnosine. In general, the Wsh/Wsh mice had lower relative analyte concentrations when compared
to their heterozygous littermates (e.g., histidine, choline, and various
amino acids). The +/+ mice were also analyzed; some
metabolites exhibited the same trends observed in the Wsh/Wsh and Wsh/+ comparison, while others did not. For example, the +/+ mice had lower levels of creatinine in comparison with
the other two genotypes, and the Wsh/Wsh and Wsh/+ mice
had comparable levels of betaine, but higher concentrations were observed
in the +/+ counterparts. Furthermore, seven analyte
levels were statistically lower in the Wsh/Wsh when compared to the +/+ mice, including acetylcholine,
glutathione, and a few additional amino acids (Figure 2). While graded concentration levels for a number of analytes
were observed (Wsh/Wsh < Wsh/+ < +/+), these often did not rise to the point of statistical significance
for all genotypes studied (Figure 2; e.g.,
serine and valine were statistically different in the Wsh/Wsh and Wsh/+ comparison but not for the Wsh/+ and +/+ comparison).

Figure 2 Metabolites

in pairwise comparisons of Wsh/Wsh, Wsh/+, and +/+ mice. Bars show the mean of normalized abundances measured
in the biological replicates for each genotype; error bars represent
standard error; p-values from the corresponding Student’s
t-tests are tabulated to the left. Statistically significant differences
in the levels of these analytes (p ≤ 0.05)
are also supported by gene expression data. Metabolites associated
with differentially expressed metabolic pathways identified by gene
expression analysis are marked with black bold in the table. An asterisk
indicates that the intensity is reflective of the second peak in the
isotopic series due to its high concentration. Key: WT (W), Wsh/+ (H), Wsh/Wsh (S).

The observed metabolite changes were supplemented with transcriptomic
measurements to further characterize the chemistry of the sample;
specifically, differences in gene expression were determined in the
hippocampal samples from Wsh/Wsh and Wsh/+ mice.
Furthermore, because mast cells are known to be intimately involved
in allergic responses, gene expression data was also collected and
analyzed for mice exposed to either an allergen or a saline control.
The accumulated data revealed that differentially expressed genes
appeared to be related to the observed changes in metabolites; therefore,
the corresponding expression and metabolite data were further examined
to assess the relationships between the metabolic pathways that included
the differentially expressed genes and those associated with altered
mast cell composition. The gene expression data was analyzed for various
pairwise combinations in a 2 × 2 experimental design (Wsh/Wsh versus Wsh/+ animals, treated with either saline or
allergen). These comparisons were indicative of changes in gene expression
as a consequence of the c-Kit mutation. In the pairwise comparison,
21 differentially expressed genes were found to be associated with
pathways that are involved with changing metabolites.

Among
the c-Kit associated-metabolite pathway-related (CA-MPR)
genes were those coding for acetylcholinesterase, pyruvate dehydrogenase
(lipoamide) beta, and genes involved in autophagy (Table S3 in the Supporting Information). In particular, 19 CA-MPR
genes had significantly different expression levels between the Wsh/Wsh and Wsh/+ mice, both treated with an allergen. When extending
this analysis to also include the WT mice (Table S3 in the Supporting Information), 50 differentially expressed
genes were associated with pathways involved with changing metabolites
in the Wsh/Wsh, Wsh/+, and +/+ genotype comparison
(Figure 2).

Hierarchical cluster analysis
was implemented on the data to help
further evaluate connections between gene expression and metabolite
composition of the hippocampi. As shown in Figure 3, when comparing WT and Wsh/Wsh mice, the
majority of the metabolites that varied by genotype had a matching
pathway identified based solely on differential gene expression. As
can also be seen from the figure, different pathways can implicate
multiple metabolites; furthermore, each metabolite can participate
in several pathways. Thus, with the exception of the phenylalanine/tyrosine
metabolism pathways, Figure 3 may be better
viewed as an interconnected metabolic super network. The clustering
pattern (bottom right corner of the diagram) indicates that the network
is mostly governed by changes in the arginine/proline and glycine,
serine and threonine, and purine metabolism pathways. (See Table S2
in the Supporting Information for the complete
listing of metabolites and affected pathways for the three genotypes.)
It is remarkable that many canonical KEGG metabolic pathways associated
with the metabolites noted to change in abundance were also detected
by the analysis of differential gene expression in hippocampi from
the same animal groups, providing a mechanistic link between the differences
in animal genotypes and variations in the metabolite abundance (Figures 2 and 3). Thus, the two analytically
orthogonal techniques used in combination here are able to describe
the same events at different levels of phenotypic expression, thereby
independently supporting and ameliorating each other.

Figure 3 Hierarchical clustering
of affected metabolites based on their
participation in pathways containing differentially expressed genes.
Pathways (rows) were clustered against metabolites (columns) monitored
by CE–ESI-MS using the UPGMA clustering algorithm with the
Euclidean distance as a similarity measure. A yellow block in the
diagram indicates that a given metabolite is involved in the corresponding
pathway containing mast cell-associated genes found through the expression
analysis.

Choline, Acetylcholine,
and Histidine Changes
Several
metabolic pathways are consistent with the observed differences in
metabolite levels and gene expression, such as choline and acetylcholine.
Acetylcholinesterase gene expression was statistically different between
saline-treated Wsh/Wsh and Wsh/+ mice as well as between
allergen-treated Wsh/Wsh and Wsh/+ mice. This finding was
consistent with the observed choline deficit in Wsh/Wsh mice. While there was no statistical difference for acetylcholine
between Wsh/Wsh and Wsh/+ mice, there was a statistical
difference between Wsh/Wsh and +/+ mice as well as a relative decrease in acetylcholine concentrations
(Wsh/Wsh < Wsh/+ < +/+) (see
Table S4 in the Supporting Information).
Differential expression of the gene for choline dehydrogenase was
also observed, which could be a result of the observed lower levels
of choline. Furthermore, downstream metabolite levels in this pathway
were also statistically different between the genotypes (e.g., betaine
and methionine). Moreover, this pathway provides a connection to the
synthesis of multiple amino acids; our observed differences in amino
acid levels are in agreement with this notion.

Altered choline
and acetylcholine levels have been linked to several behaviors or
disorders that were also observed in the mast cell-deficient mice.
For example, hippocampal neurogenesis is modulated by prenatal choline
availability,32 which could be participating
in the observed neurogenesis of the Wsh/Wsh genotype. Likewise, choline can also affect visuospatial memory
as a function of choline administration33−35 and affect hippocampal
plasticity.36 Acetylcholine is involved
in a variety of functions, including learning and memory in the hippocampus.37 The acetylcholine deficit can contribute to
the observed defects in spatial memory and learning. Furthermore,
acetylcholine release in the hippocampus in response to anxiety and
stress has been documented and results in an anxiolytic effect.38−42 If acetylcholine levels are impaired, this may contribute to the
observed anxiety-like behavior in these mice.

Mast cells release
histamine in response to acetylcholine.43,44 Histamine
levels were lower the Wsh/Wsh mice compared
to the Wsh/+ littermates, confirming that mast cells contribute to brain histamine
levels.18 While the levels of histamine
were below the limits of detection for the current instrument platform,
its precursor, histidine, was measured at lower levels in Wsh/Wsh mice compared to the Wsh/+ mice. The lack of mast cells
may result in lower expression levels of these analytes in other cell
types in the hippocampus because they are no longer needed to regulate
mast cell release.

Amino Acid Metabolism
While the
changes in molecules
related to cell–cell signaling discussed in the previous section
were expected based on the mediators released by mast cells, the decrease
in many monitored amino acids in the c-Kit mice is surprising, as
most pathways do not affect amino acids so indiscriminately. Depletion
of amino acids can induce autophagy, a catabolic process in which
cells are degraded for energy production.45 In the brain, increased autophagy is observed after injury46 and complete impairment of autophagy results
in neurodegeneration.47,48 While this scenario was not directly
tested in the current work, it is possible that autophagy had been
induced, which would result in a modified cellular environment. In
agreement, several genes for proteins involved in autophagy were differentially
expressed between the Wsh/Wsh and Wsh/+ littermates (Table
S3 in the Supporting Information; Ras proteins).

Another possible reason for the amino acid-level changes may be
related to the pyruvate dehydrogenase beta (Pdhb)
gene; this gene is differentially expressed in Wsh/Wsh versus Wsh/+ mice after allergen treatment. Pdhb participates
in the citrate, or Krebs, cycle and so is involved in multiple amino
acid pathways. Pdhb is also involved in pyruvate
metabolism, which is connected to nicotinamide metabolism, the biosynthesis
of several amino acids including lysine, and is directly involved
in leucine biosynthesis. Additionally, the nicotinamide pathway is
included under the affected pathway list determined by the gene expression
analysis (Figure 3). Such dysregulation of Pdhb expression could be responsible for the decrease in
multiple amino acids and nicotinamide observed in the Wsh/Wsh mice as compared to the Wsh/+ littermates.

Additional Altered Pathways
Some of the differences
between Kit mutant and WT animals are not directly
involved with the repertoire of chemical mediators that are localized
within mast cell granules. Instead they implicate targets of mast
cell mediators (i.e., chemicals released by mast cells that act on
other parenchymal elements). For the gene expression analysis, particular
attention was focused on mining the data for differences in expression
related to the metabolite changes described in the CE–ESI-MS
analyses.

Pathway analysis revealed that the mast cell-dependent
metabolites and mast cell-associated differentially expressed genes
share many of the same pathways. Using hierarchical clustering analysis,
metabolites were grouped based on their participation in metabolic
pathways that included differentially expressed genes (Figure 3). It was observed that the majority of affected
pathways and metabolites were connected either by shared pathways
or by their products, forming a single network. This was true despite
the use of unrelated control mice (WT and +/+). It
may be inferred from the data that the majority of the metabolite
changes may be regulated by changes in gene expression of a handful
of pathways, seen at the bottom of the diagram. The exact details
of such regulation may be a tempting subject for a follow-up study.

Several pathway/metabolite combinations are intriguing, given what
is known about mast cell function within the brain. For example, the Pdhb gene is differentially expressed in a mast cell-dependent
manner and has been shown to increase in the rat hippocampus after
chronic antidepressant treatments (like serotonin), in addition to
other proteins that are associated with neurogenesis.49 Stress has also been shown to suppress hippocampal neurogenesis,
which is mediated by interleukin-1,50,51 a cytokine
that mast cells synthesize.52 As noted
in an independent study, Wsh/Wsh mice exhibit
heightened anxiety-like behavior.18

Similarly, stress has resulted in amino acid level changes in various
biological sample matrixes. For example, amino acids have been found
to change in blood plasma, urine, and regions of the brain as a result
of stress;53−58 furthermore, some murine models of chronic stress also demonstrate
severe immunosuppression,59,60 which could be mediated
by mast cells. Additional support for a link between mast cells and
stress is that chronic stress results in increased numbers of mast
cells in the CNS.61 Stress can also induce
increased permeability of the blood-brain-barrier through mast cell
activation,62,63 which could be responsible for
molecular differences.

Kit mutant animals are
well-known for their augmented
response to allergens. Thus, it was interesting to see whether genes
associated with the metabolic differences found between Wsh and +/+ animals are
differentially expressed during the allergic reaction in a Kit-dependent manner. These genes and their association
with a particular metabolite and its expression are shown in Table
S3 in the Supporting Information. It is
remarkable that in addition to the genes apparently associated with
metabolic pathways and specific metabolites, many of the metabolites
in turn are associated with neuroligand receptor interaction pathways.
These include Crhr1, Aplnr, Gabra2, Scrtr, Drd2, and signal transduction
pathways and global transcription regulators such as Nkiras2, Rasl10a,
Mapk1, and Dvl2.

Mast Cells in Behavioral and Physiological
Systems
The combined cell count of neurons, glia, and microglia
in the mouse
hippocampus is greater than one million,64−68 while mast cells are far fewer in number. The entire
mouse brain is estimated to contain an average of 500 mast cells,
with a range of 180–709 mast cells per individual in the mouse
strain studied in our work.69 In contrast
to resting microglia however, mast cells constantly release their
granular material, even at rest. Their population is mobile, and they
can be rapidly recruited in response to normal physiological signals
and following immune system activation.12,70−72 Furthermore, mast cells are present and actively release their granular
material throughout development. In this context, it may not be surprising
that large-scale metabolite differences are observed between Wsh/Wsh and Wsh/+ mice. While some of the metabolites present in
mast cells may be distinct from those in other brain cells (e.g.,
neurons, glia, and endothelial cells), the greater than 3 orders of
magnitude difference in cell-type abundance and the ubiquitous nature
of the metabolites with affected levels (e.g., the amino acids) indicates
that the majority of changes are in metabolites external to mast cells.
Thus, this mutation, and likely the lack of mast cells, appears to
affect large numbers of hippocampal cells. Mast cell granules have
many potent mediators, and these released mediators can migrate over
great distances.18,73,74 Perhaps the observed chemical changes are a result of volume transmission,
an intracellular mode of communication that potentially affects and
modulates the activity of entire brain regions.75 Another possibility is that the deficits are attributable
to the cumulative effect throughout development of the Kit mutation or the mast cell deficit. Some aspects previously attributed
to the mast cell deficit may turn out to be due to the disrupted Kit receptor. The development of mice deficient in mast
cells independent of alterations in the Kit receptor76 will enable the examination of whether this
receptor might contribute to the losses described herein.

Conclusions
The combination of CE–MS-based metabolomics and whole genome
transcriptomics approaches enabled us to determine chemical changes
and understand how they relate to an observed phenotype. In c-Kit
mutant mice, there is a striking global chemical difference in the
hippocampus metabolite content, which may be caused by changes in
the hippocampal cell chemical content consequent to loss of mast cells
or of the Kit receptor. A drastic chemical effect
is observed in both the brain metabolic profile and in a remarkable
range of pathways. The magnitude of these molecular changes is surprising
given the relatively small number (and fraction) of mast cells in
the brain. It is intriguing to speculate how these changes correlate
to the observed behavioral and developmental differences observed
in Kit mutant mice.19 Compounds
of particular interest include choline, with its link to memory and
neurogenesis, as well as acetylcholine and its relationship to stress,
learning, and memory. Less straightforward to interpret is the decrease
in abundance of multiple amino acids. There may be a cumulative developmental
link, which is suggested by prior studies highlighting a significant
decrease in neurogenesis observed in mast cell-deficient mice.19 Furthermore, the possibility of aggregating
the pathways and metabolites via hierarchical clustering suggests
that the majority of the pathways form a single interconnected network
based on the metabolites common to both. Regardless, these global
chemical differences provide a framework for follow-up experiments
to obtain specific mechanistic information, as well as to understand
how specific cell types such as neurons and glia are affected. The
combination of metabolomic and transcriptomic measurements allows
us to highlight pathways common to both platforms, thus producing
a small but validated list of metabolic pathways on which to focus
future studies; as both approaches are information rich and compatible
with a range of sample sizes down to individual brain nuclei, this
approach offers potential for a number of brain studies.
