Ion
mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) allows separation of native
protein ions into “conformational families”. Increasing
the IM resolving power should allow finer structural information to
be obtained and can be achieved by increasing the length of the IM
separator. This, however, increases the time that protein ions spend
in the gas phase and previous experiments have shown that the initial
conformations of small proteins can be lost within tens of milliseconds.
Here, we report on investigations of protein ion stability using a
multipass traveling wave (TW) cyclic IM (cIM) device. Using this device,
minimal structural changes were observed for Cytochrome C after hundreds
of milliseconds, while no changes were observed for a larger multimeric
complex (Concanavalin A). The geometry of the instrument (Q-cIM-ToF)
also enables complex tandem IM experiments to be performed, which
were used to obtain more detailed collision-induced unfolding pathways
for Cytochrome C. The instrument geometry provides unique capabilities
with the potential to expand the field of protein analysis via IM-MS.

==== Body
The invention
of soft-ionization
techniques1−3 has allowed the transfer of intact biomolecules and
proteins into the gas phase.4−6 Early electrospray mass spectrometry
experiments (ESI-MS) showed pronounced differences in charge state
distribution depending on the solution conditions, suggesting that
solution phase protein structure can be probed using ESI-MS.7 In their landmark work, Clemmer and Jarrold constructed
an ESI–ion mobility–mass spectrometer (ESI-IM-MS), which
revealed that a single charge state of a protein can be present in
a range of conformations.8 This sparked
a significant interest in studies of proteins in the gas phase. IM-MS
has the advantage of being able to detect multiple and lowly populated
conformational ensembles from small sample volumes, which are comparable
to those seen in solution when the ions have a low internal energy
(Eint).9 Being
able to detect these conformational states provides information on
protein folding dynamics and requires far lower sample concentrations
when compared to other structural techniques such as X-ray crystallography
and NMR. Introduction of the first mainstream commercial IM-MS instrumentation
(Synapt HDMS, Waters Corporation, 2006)10 accelerated implementation of the technique in protein studies.
IM-MS has been used to show the basic dynamic behavior of proteins,11−13 protein domain organization,14 and to
identify and investigate the structural dynamics of disordered proteins.15,16 Deliberate activation of ions through increasing the internal energy
via collisional heating can cause unfolding,17 which can provide important information on the structural stability
of proteins under different conditions or with different states, the
effect of modifications or ligands on protein structure and dynamics,16,18,19 and the subunit organization
of oligomers.19,20 This can also be applied to protein
complexes to investigate oligomerization pathways and subunit organization
of complexes.12,21−24

IM-MS functions by introducing
analyte ions into a drift-cell containing
an inert buffer gas such as helium or nitrogen. Ions drift through
the cell under the influence of an electric field and collide with
buffer gas molecules. Drift velocity of ions is governed by their
mobility which is inversely proportional to their collision cross-section
(CCS). Species that are extended (larger CCS) will undergo a greater
number of collisions with the buffer gas and have a longer drift time
compared to more compact species (smaller CCS). Mass to charge ratios
(m/z) are then measured for each
ion by a mass spectrometer.

Increasing the resolution of the
IM device should, in principle,
enable separation of overlapping features, allowing greater understanding
of protein structures in the gas phase. The resolution of the IM device
depends on the temperature, ion charge, electric field, and the path
length.25 There are several examples in
the literature where attempts were made to increase the resolution
of the IM apparatus by decreasing the temperature,26,27 increasing the electric field,28 and
increasing the path length.29,30 Conventionally, the
latter is a physical distance that ions travel, and thus, a number
of several meters long drift tube (DT) type instruments have been
realized.31−33 There are practical limits in this approach related
to the physical size of the apparatus and high voltages required.
Alternatively, an experimental setup with inverted “frame of
reference” can be envisaged, where the ions are trapped in
a stream of moving gas by an opposing electric field, as in the case
of trapped ion mobility spectrometry technique (TIMS).34 Here, the “effective path length”
can be influenced by a separation time scale and gas velocity. Another
way of achieving a long separation path is to utilize multipass devices.
The cyclotron mobility spectrometer described by Glaskin et al. uses
a drift cell made of four curved segments that are joined by ion funnels,35 which refocus ions.29 An electric field applied to subsequent segments/funnels is switched;
only the ions with mobilities resonant with the field switching frequency
can proceed to the following segments, while others are lost. An IM
spectrum is obtained by scanning the field switching frequency. Several
developments of high resolution IM instrumentation have been facilitated
by traveling wave (T-Wave, TW) technology,36 which relies on a series of voltage pulses that propel ions across
the device. T-Wave technology eliminates problems related to high
voltages, required for the traditional, linear field DT-IM apparatus.
A T-Wave based, multipass cyclic IM (cIM) separator was first introduced
by Giles et al.,37 and separation at a
path length over 50 m was demonstrated.38 Further advances in a T-Wave technology include structures for lossless
ion manipulation (SLIM), notably by Smith et al.39 A multipass SLIM device has allowed IM separations over
an extremely long path length (∼1 km).40 Other recent developments in IM technology include tandem methods.
A two-stage IM technique was first presented by Koeniger et al.,32,41 where an instrument featuring two drift tubes allowed separation
in the first IM stage, mobility selection, activation, and separation
of product ions in the second stage. This was further expanded to
a three-stage IM method by Merenbloom et al.31 More recently, the multistage IM technology was combined with a
multipass cyclic IM separator by Giles et al.,38 allowing for IMSn-type workflows.

Increasing
the resolution of IM separation via path length typically
increases experiment time scales. Understandably, changes in the nature
of analyte ions occurring on the time scale of separation are undesirable.
Previous work by Badman et al. showed that Cytochrome C ions underwent
structural changes with time.42,43 Utilizing a quadrupole
ion trap (QIT)-IM-MS instrument, ions were stored for varying amounts
of time in the QIT, prior the IM-MS measurement. The structural changes
started occurring at approximately 30 ms and had stabilized after
60 ms, showing that the initial population of +7 to +10 ions contains
precursors or conformational intermediates that unfold in the gas
phase.42 Similar results were reported
for ubiquitin.44 It was suggested that
solution specific conformations transform to new gas phase structures
in the absence of solvent after a period of 30 ms. More recently,
Allen et al. have utilized a SLIM-based tandem IM instrument45 to study the Cytochrome C ions. It was shown
that structural changes occurred an order of magnitude later than
reported previously. This was attributed primarily to pressure-related
differences in effective ion temperatures46 in the QIT and tandem IM systems and also solution-dependent effects,
further confirmed by collision-induced unfolding (CIU) experiments.45 Collectively, the previous work suggests that
IM separation time scales appropriate for native protein ions is likely
to be on the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds, especially
for larger ions.

Importantly, Badman et al. utilized a relatively
short, linear
field DT device, where transit times are on the order of tens of milliseconds,
comparable to trapping times in the QIT. Moreover, due to a relatively
low velocity of ions in such devices, their effective temperatures
are essentially equal to that of the buffer gas. The latter is not
necessarily the case in the T-Wave based IM separation. It was reported
previously that some ion heating during the T-Wave based IM separation
can cause structure perturbation, the effect being especially pronounced
for low molecular weight, high mobility species.47,48 The native protein ions typically have relatively low charge and
high mass, thus, representing a contrasting case, in principle. Nevertheless,
it is of interest and of importance to evaluate the extent of native
structure perturbation upon prolonged exposure to T-Waves, particularly
in relation to the possibility of high-resolution IM separations in
the future.

Here, we utilize a prototype cIM-MS instrument enabling
custom
experiments designed to further explore the stability of monomeric
(Cytochrome C, β-Lactoglobulin) and multimeric (Concanavalin
A) proteins, in a T-Wave based separator. Ions were subjected to trapping
in a region of the cIM device, and native conformations were found
to be stable for hundreds of milliseconds. Additional experiments
were also performed to show that extended time within the cIM device
under typical separation conditions does not significantly impact
protein structure in the gas phase. IMS-CIU-IMS experiments revealed
detailed unfolding pathways for Cytochrome C. Our results agree with
previous reports suggesting that the native-like conformation or proteins
is maintained in the gas phase under extended time scales and, for
the first time, show that this is also true within a cIM device. Collectively,
our data show that the cIM instrument can be used for studying protein
dynamics, stability, and unfolding in the gas phase.

Methods
Sample Preparation
The proteins (equine Cytochrome
C (Merck Millipore, U.K.), β-lactoglobulin (Sigma, U.K.), and
Concanavalin A (Sigma, U.K.)) were buffer exchanged into 200 mM ammonium
acetate solution using 3, 10, or 30 kDa Amicon Ultra 0.5 mL centrifugal
spin filters (Merck Millipore, U.K.). The samples were spun a total
of three times at 12000 rpm for 15 min at room temperature. The protein
was then diluted to 8–10 μM after concentration calculation
using a Qubit protein assay (ThermoFisher Scientific, U.K.).

Mass Spectrometry
The samples were introduced into
the instrument using a nano-ESI source (Waters Corp., Wilmslow, U.K.).
The emitters (manufactured using a P97 Flaming/Brown micropipette
puller, coated in gold using a Quorum Q150R S sputter coater) were
held at 1.2 kV. The cIM instrument design is discussed in detail elsewhere49,50 and so will only be briefly covered here. The instrument schematic
is presented in Figure 1. Ions are transferred from the source through the first vacuum stages
using ion guide arrangements (StepWave), which propel ions toward
the quadrupole mass filter. The subsequent trap cell is used for accumulating
ions prior to IM separation. The resulting ion packets are then transported
through an ion guide (IG) and injected into a helium cell. In this
work we utilize the injection energy into the He cell to generate
some of the collision induced unfolding (CIU) data. The subsequent
ion guide (prestore) transports the ions into a multifunction array
(Figure 1C) of electrodes
forming part of an orthogonal closed loop, the cIM separator (98 cm
path length, single pass resolving power (RP) of ∼65 (CCS/ΔCCS)
measured using the inverse-sequence peptide pair (SDGRG and GRGDS).50 The cIM chamber is filled directly with nitrogen
to a pressure of ∼2.2 mbar (including some contribution from
helium gas leaking in from the He cell) and the T-wave height was
40 V. The T-Wave direction in the array can be altered to either match
those in the cIM device (i.e., separate) or to inject/eject ions from
it. The control software GUI enables creation of custom sequences
of functions to facilitate selective ejection of ions from the cyclic
IM device and/or activation followed by further separation of product
ions.50 The typical sequence of events
employed in single/multipass experiments is presented in Figure S1. Post cIM, ions are transported through
an ion guide (Post-Store) and on to the ToF via a segmented quadrupole
(XS) transfer cell. The transfer cell allows activation of mobility
separated ions. The orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight (oa-ToF)
features an offset V geometry allowing m/z measurements at resolutions in excess of 60000 fwhm.38

optics; (C) Multifunction region.

In addition to a typical single/multipass operation (Figure S1), three custom modes of operation were
designed to explore protein stability over extended experiment times
in the high-pressure cIM device. First, in the “trapping”
mode ions are stored in the array for a prolonged period of time,
before IM separation takes place (Figure S2). This mode enables the time-resolved assessment of the protein
conformation stability in the absence of any (intentional) activation.
Second, the “spinning” mode was designed to verify the
effect of ion heating during the T-Wave-based IM separation (Figure S3). Normally, the number of passes around
the cIM (and, hence, separation time) is limited by so-called wrap-around,
a phenomenon where the fastest ions ultimately catch up with the slowest
ones.50 To extend the exposure to T-Waves,
ions are passed around the cIM device for varying amounts of time
(allowing wrap-around) before being recollected in the prestore and
subjected to another IM separation before detection. It should be
noted that while the ions are being manipulated in the cIM device,
the next set of ions are continually being accumulated in the trap
region (∼10–2 mbar of N2) of the
instrument. Consequently, at the start of the cIM manipulation, the
ions will have an average gas-phase lifetime of around half of the
cIM experiment time. To minimize activation of ions entering the cIM
and retain low-energy conformations, generally the injection voltage
into the He cell is kept as low as possible while still maintaining
reasonable transmission. Experiments to help elucidate the effect
of ion storage in the trap region alone were carried out (see Figures S4 and S5) and indicated no significant
activation with time. Lastly, the IMS-CIU-IMS mode of operation is
used (Figure S6). Here, a mobility-selected
ion population can be ejected and trapped in the prestore, while the
remaining ions are removed from the cIM. The selected ions are then
reinjected into the array, but with a higher voltage between the two
regions to induce activation. This way, we can probe unfolding transitions
of selected regions of arrival time space, increasing the specificity
of CIU experiments.18,51 In this work we focus on the
dual stage method; however, multistage experiments (IMSn) can be performed in an analogous way.

Data Analysis
Data were analyzed using Masslynx v4.1
(Waters Corporation) and Driftscope v2.1 (Waters Corporation). To
compare the data, the gross arrival time had the injection time (10
ms) subtracted to give drift-time. In the case of trapping experiments,
the time spent in the array (0–360 ms) was also subtracted.
For spinning, the extended cyclic motion (0–360 ms) and the
reinjection time (45 ms) were subtracted. CIU fingerprint plots were
created using Benthesikyme.52 Population
fitting was performed using in-house software written in Python 2.7,
peak maxima were identified using the second derivative and manually
adjusted to ensure the same conformational populations were tracked
across the different experiments. During trapping and spinning experiments
the data were aligned according to the most intense peak to allow
the same centroid value for each Gaussian population for tracking.
In the case where a second conformational population became the maximum
peak, the two most intense peaks were used for alignment. Each conformational
family was approximated by a Gaussian distribution. The sum of all
distributions was optimized to produce the best fit to the experimental
data or trace. No restraint to the full width half-maximum value of
each Gaussian was imposed like in previous work.52 The code is freely available at https://github.com/ThalassinosLab/CIVU.

Results
Cytochrome C
CytC was analyzed,
and a very narrow charge
state distribution was observed, with high abundance of the +7 charge
state (Figure 2A),
which was quadrupole selected for experimentation (1765 m/z). Other charge states ranging from +8 to +5 could
be seen at low abundance. Minimal activation upon both trapping and
spinning experiments was observed for the +7 (Figure 3A–C). Comparing these structural transitions
to the CytC +7 CIU plots (Figure 3C), they are equivalent to less than 5 V of activation.
The time scales of conformational change are similar to previous studies.45

slices, arranged in increasing experimental increment, i.e., trapping
time (ms), from dark to light shading. Plotted is the drift time against
normalized intensity.

β-Lactoglobulin
β-Lactoglobulin (βLac)
is a 16 kDa protein, with several disulfide bridges, that exists as
a monomer and dimer in solution; with the ratio being dependent on
protein concentration and the ionic strength of the solution.53 βLac was detected mainly as monomer (Figure 2B), and the charge
states +7 to +9 were quadrupole isolated for further analysis (2663,
2294, and 2940 m/z, respectively).
The +7 charge state did not display structural changes upon trapping
or spinning (Figures S8A–C and S11); however, the +8 and +9 charges displayed very minimal structural
changes over the course of 240 ms (Figures 3D–F, S12, and S13) comparable to 10–20 V of intentional activation
(Figure S8I).

Concanavalin A
To investigate the effect of prolonged
gas phase exposure on the stability of multimeric complexes we analyzed
Concanavalin A (ConA), a protein which exists as a 51 kDa dimer or
102 kDa tetramer. The mass spectrum of ConA contained monomeric, dimeric,
and tetrameric species, with the most intense peaks belonging to the
dimeric states (Figure 2C). The tetrameric +21 charge state was quadrupole isolated for further
analysis (4894 m/z). Here, no structural
perturbation upon trapping or spinning (Figure 3H,I, S14) was observed. In addition, no complex
dissociation was observed, apart from under deliberate activation
conditions (Figure S9). The CIU experiments
revealed that minimal conformational changes were observed at up to
50 V activation (Figure 3I).

Increased Resolution
Multipass cIM separation offers
increased resolution as a function of the square root of the number
of passes, n (√(nz), where z is the ion charge state).37 The above experiments have shown that extended time in both the
prestore and, when under T-Wave motion in the cIM, can cause small
conformational changes for some protein ions, but not others, and
this appears to be strongly related to mass and charge state. The
+7 charge state ions of CytC generated from ammonium acetate were
subjected to 1–3 passes around the cyclic ion guide (Figure 4).

Figure 4 CytC (AmAc) +7 charge
state arrival time distribution after multiple
passes of the cyclic drift-region 1, 2, and 3 passes in the cIM. The
measured ATD of singly charged reserpine (m/z 609) is shown to indicate the expected diffusion-limited
peak width along with the derived peak for a +7 charge state species.

Subjecting the +7 ions to higher
resolution separation revealed
some evidence of new features in the broadened ATD (Figure 4A–C), however, distinct
peaks were not seen. This suggests that the initial width of the protein
ATD is due to the extremely large variety of highly similar conformational
families, unresolvable by the cIM separator operating at a resolving
power of ∼300 (CCS/ΔCCS derived for a +7 ion) at 3 passes
(the peaks of singly charged reserpine, expected to be diffusion limited,
are also shown in Figure 4, for comparison). This, however, is not always the case and
is most likely protein, charge state, and solution condition specific.
For example, early experiments with bovine insulin ions (generated
from denaturing solution) showed that increased number of passes allows
greater resolution of previously unresolvable features (Figure S15).

As an alternative approach
to probe the presence of structural
subpopulations in more detail, we used an IMS-CIU-IMS approach.

IMS-CIU-IMS
An experiment which can be performed on
this instrument is multistage IMS (IMSn), where a subset
ion population can be selected after IM separation, activated, and
subjected to IM separation again. Due to the geometry of the instrument
this can theoretically be done a limitless number of times. Here we
will focus our attention on phenomena that can be probed in more detail
compared to a traditional single stage collision induced unfolding
(CIU) analysis. As an example, we use the quadrupole isolated, +7
ion of CytC was activated on injection to the trap (20 V). The initial
ATD is presented in Figure 5A. We then use the IMS-CIU-IMS methodology, where the CIU
occurs on reinjection to the array from the prestore, to obtain unfolding
profiles of 4 subsets of this initial population (B–E). Conformation
α, upon activation, directly converts into conformations β,
γ, and δ. As longer drift time conformations are selected,
populations β to δ are directly accessed. This shows the
sequence of unfolding events, however it cannot be confirmed that
this is nonreversible. Two conformations, ε (not directly selected)
and ζ (not present in initial ATD), appear after the extension
of conformation δ, between 60–80 V of activation.

Discussion
Our
data show that proteins can to a large extent retain their
native and multimeric states over the time scales compatible with
high resolution IM separations. Importantly, the effect of prolonged
exposure to T-waves appears, in most cases, similar to trapping alone,
indicating little structural perturbation induced by T-wave based
separation itself. In this study we explored time scales up to 360
ms, which would typically exceed the realistic time scales for separation
of protein ions. These time scales (and number of passes around the
device) are limited by wrap-around in the present setup. The aforementioned
CytC work by Allen et al.,45 explored time
scales up to 33 s, which at the moment is beyond the scope of our
work. The magnitude of change observed over several hundred milliseconds
by Allen et al. agrees well with data presented here. This is an order
of magnitude longer than reported previously by Badman et al.39 It would seem plausible that this is due to
the fact that the quadrupole ion trap (QIT) used to retain the protein
ions for increments of time operated at a much lower pressure, approximately
0.0133 mbar42,43 compared to ∼2.2 mbar
in the cIM device and the ∼5 mbar used in the SLIM based tandem
IM. However, the trapping region of this instrument operates at similar
pressures to the QIT and our data shows that increasing the time spent
in the trapping cell does not significantly affect ion conformation
(Figure S5). We will attempt to explore
this in future work.

The loss of native conformation is less
apparent for larger proteins.
For βLac, the lowest charge state observed (+7) did not undergo
any detectable change. Higher charge states (+8, +9) were minimally
perturbed, and only after 240 ms. This is in agreement with previous
reports showing that low charge states are more reflective of the
solution conformation of proteins.54 No
loss of initial conformations was observed for ConA. This suggests
that the gas phase longevity of the native structures is proportional
to the ion mass and, most likely, inversely proportional to its charge.
CytC may indeed be particularly sensitive to gas phase studies as
previous work showed that while it does not undergo backbone changes,
the surface residues are rearranged55−57 and it retains fewer
salt bridges when in the gas-phase rather than in solution.58 Gas-phase salt bridges are thought to play a
very important role in the retention of native or native-like states,
due to the much lower electrostatic permittivity of the vacuum compared
to that of aqueous solution.59−61 Interestingly, subjecting native
protein ions to an increased number of passes around the cIM device
did not resolve overlapping features, suggesting that the ATDs of
native ions consist of a very large number or even a continuum of
conformers.41 This is perhaps not so surprising
if we imagine, for example, a variety of ways in which solvent exposed
residues of the protein can be rearranged during desolvation. This
observation is somewhat parallel with the previous findings from a
study utilizing variable temperature IM instrumentation,26 where only a minimal increase in resolution
was observed for native protein ions at cryogenic temperatures. Collectively,
this suggests that the native protein ATDs are naturally broad, not
due to diffusion or interconversion, but inherent conformational heterogeneity,
which is consistent with previous findings in the field.41,62 The above phenomena will be investigated in the future work utilizing
the high resolution capabilities of the instrument combined with the
IMS-CIU-IMS methodology presented here.
