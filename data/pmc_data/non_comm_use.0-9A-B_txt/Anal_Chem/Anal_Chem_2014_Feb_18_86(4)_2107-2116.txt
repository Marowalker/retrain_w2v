Ion mobility-mass spectrometry measurements
which describe the
gas-phase scaling of molecular size and mass are of both fundamental
and pragmatic utility. Fundamentally, such measurements expand our
understanding of intrinsic intramolecular folding forces in the absence
of solvent. Practically, reproducible transport properties, such as
gas-phase collision cross-section (CCS), are analytically useful metrics
for identification and characterization purposes. Here, we report
594 CCS values obtained in nitrogen drift gas on an electrostatic
drift tube ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) instrument. The
instrument platform is a newly developed prototype incorporating a
uniform-field drift tube bracketed by electrodynamic ion funnels and
coupled to a high resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer.
The CCS values reported here are of high experimental precision (±0.5%
or better) and represent four chemically distinct classes of molecules
(quaternary ammonium salts, lipids, peptides, and carbohydrates),
which enables structural comparisons to be made between molecules
of different chemical compositions for the rapid “omni-omic”
characterization of complex biological samples. Comparisons made between
helium and nitrogen-derived CCS measurements demonstrate that nitrogen
CCS values are systematically larger than helium values; however,
general separation trends between chemical classes are retained regardless
of the drift gas. These results underscore that, for the highest CCS
accuracy, care must be exercised when utilizing helium-derived CCS
values to calibrate measurements obtained in nitrogen, as is the common
practice in the field.

==== Body
With the
rising demand for high-throughput
analyses of increasingly complex samples, ion mobility-mass spectrometry
(IM-MS) has found broad application in the analysis of biological
systems, as this rapid 2D separation (ms and μs, respectively)
provides comprehensive molecular information regarding analyte size,
mass, and relative abundance. In ion mobility, separation is achieved
by low-energy interactions of charged analytes with an inert buffer
gas (conventionally helium or nitrogen), where analyte size-to-charge
ratio is measured as a function of the time required to traverse the
mobility region.1 As a means of comparison
with other laboratory measurements, drift time values are either normalized
to standard temperature and pressure as a reduced mobility (K0) or converted to a collision cross-section
(CCS) value, the latter of which is a size parameter related to the
averaged momentum transfer impact area of the molecule.2 Structural information in the form of CCS values
assists in the characterization of analytes by biomolecular class,
as these classes are known to separate in IM-MS space and adopt conformational
correlations due to prevailing class-specific structural folding in
the gas phase.3,4 These class-specific mobility-mass
correlations can be used as a predictor for molecule class, demonstrating
the potential value of IM-MS structural separations for life sciences
research which seek systems biology level information. Expanding upon
this concept, CCS-based molecular prediction has previously been explored
for peptides, utilizing intrinsic size parameter calculations5,6 and machine learning algorithms7 for
sequence prediction, but no detailed study of other biochemical classes
has yet been undertaken.

The separation and characterization
of biological samples by IM-MS
has been achieved using both commercial and laboratory built instrumentation.
Virtually all contemporary commercial IM-MS instruments utilize nitrogen
as the buffer gas for IM separations, motivated by practical considerations
of cost, availability, and technical considerations for pumping requirements
and electrical discharge. The most common commercial IM-MS platform
utilizes an electrodynamic field (i.e., a traveling
wave potential) for mobility separation,8 and drift time measurements must be calibrated against electrostatic
drift tube data in order to convert these measurements to CCS values.9,10 Conversely, many independently constructed instruments incorporate
uniform electrostatic field mobility regions utilizing helium as the
buffer gas. Uniform field measurements serve as the benchmark for
electrodynamic CCS value determination, as the CCS obtained from a
uniform field drift tube can be determined empirically through kinetic
theory.11,12

One common practice among researchers
utilizing IM-MS is calibration
of nitrogen-based traveling wave ion mobility measurements against
helium-based CCS values reported in the literature.13,14 The use of helium-based CCS values to calibrate nitrogen-based drift
time measurements results in calibrated “helium-equivalent”
CCS values, which can be useful for comparing with literature values
and correlating measurements to theory.15,16 There is,
however, concern that this practice introduces added experimental
error, as nitrogen vs helium mobility measurements differ substantially
in magnitude, and the success of calibration strategies relies heavily
on careful selection of calibrants that accurately describe the sample
conditions, charge state, mass range, and chemical class of the system
of interest.9,14,17 Differences in CCS values in helium versus nitrogen arise due to
several factors including intrinsic size differences between the buffer
gases, mass effects which factor into the momentum transfer cross-section
(the experimental CCS), and the over 8-fold difference in gas polarizability
between helium and nitrogen (0.21 × 10–24 and
1.74 × 10–24 cm3, respectively).12,18

Recently, a prototype IM-MS instrument utilizing nitrogen
drift
gas was developed (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). This instrument
incorporates a uniform electrostatic field ion mobility separator
bracketed by electrodynamic focusing devices (ion funnels), which
allows for high sensitivity and direct measurements of CCS values
in nitrogen.7,19 Presented in this report is an
extensive and diverse database of empirically derived nitrogen CCS
measurements (594 values), which comprises four molecular classes
and expands upon several previous databases for the structural characterization
of biological molecules.5,7,9,20−23 This affords the opportunity
to explore the fundamental considerations of buffer gas composition
and the subsequent effects on ion mobility parameters (reduced mobility
and CCS) across different molecular classes.

Experimental Methods
Preparation
of Standards
Lipids
All solvents and buffers
were purchased as HPLC
grade from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Dry lipid extracts
were purchased from Avanti Lipids (Birmingham, AL, USA) and constituted
in chloroform prior to analysis. Lipid extracts include sphingomyelins
(SM, porcine brain), glycosphingolipids (GlcCer, porcine brain), phosphatidylcholines
(PC, chicken egg), phosphatidylserines (PS, porcine brain), and phosphatidylethanolamines
(PE, chicken egg). For analysis, lipid standards were diluted in 90%
chloroform/10% methanol (v/v) with 10 mM sodium acetate to a final
concentration of 10 μg/mL. Putative identification of lipids
was performed using the exact mass measurement through the Lipid Metabolites
and Pathways Strategy (LIPID MAPS) Structural Database (LMSD).24 A full list of identified lipids can be found
in the Supporting Information.

Carbohydrates
Carbohydrate dextrins (linear and cyclic)
and sugar alcohol standards were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Lacto-N-difucohexaose I and II and lacto-N-fucopentaose
I and II were purchased from Dextra Laboratories (Reading, UK). All
carbohydrate standards were prepared as received and reconstituted
in water with 10 mM ammonium acetate to final concentrations of 10
μg/mL. For cationization, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM LiCl, 10 mM CsCl,
10 mM KCl, and 10 mM RbCl solutions were prepared in water to a final
concentration of ca. 10 μM. A full list of
identified carbohydrates can be found in the Supporting
Information.

Peptides
Predigested peptide standards
(MassPREP) were
purchased from Waters (Milford, MA, USA). Peptide standards (SDGRG
and GRGDS) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All peptide standards
were received as a lyophilized powder and reconstituted in 10 mM ammonium
acetate in water to a final concentration of 10 μg/mL. The MassPREP
digestion standard mix contained approximately equimolar concentrations
of four tryptically digested proteins: Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH,
yeast), Serum Albumin (BSA, bovine), Phosphorylase B (PHOSPH, Rabbit)
and Enolase (ENOLASE, yeast). Peptide identifications were assigned
on the basis of exact mass of all possible tryptic peptides (no missed
cleavages) produced by the Expert Protein Analysis System (ExPASy)
PeptideMass proteomics tool25 (Swiss Institute
of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland) using the SWISS-PROT database
entry number for each intact protein (P00330, P02769, P00924, and P00489, respectively). A full list of
identified peptides can be found in the Supporting
Information.

Quaternary Ammonium Salts
Tetraalkylammonium
(TAA)
salts with alkyl chain lengths between 3 and 18 carbons (TAA3 to TAA18)
were purchased from the following sources: TAA4, TAA6, TAA7, TAA10,
TAA12, and TAA16 from Sigma-Aldrich; TAA3, TAA5, and TAA8 from Acros
Organics; and TAA18 from Alfa Aesar. All TAA salts were supplied with
a stated purity of greater than 98% and were prepared as received.
TAA3 to TAA8 were prepared in 50% methanol/50% water, while TAA10,
TAA12, TAA16, and TAA18 were prepared in 50% methanol/50% isopropanol.
Final concentrations were ca. 1 μg/mL. A full
list of primary TAA salt standards and concomitant ions identified
in the samples can be found in the Supporting
Information.

Instrumentation
A schematic of the
instrumentation
used to obtain the cross-section measurements is shown in Figure 1. The instrument used in this work is a commercial
prototype IM-MS which incorporates a drift tube coupled to a quadrupole
time-of-flight mass spectrometer (IM-Q-TOFMS, Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA). For this work, an orthogonal electrospray ionization
(ESI) source (Agilent Jet Stream) was utilized which incorporates
a heated sheath gas nebulizer to aerodynamically focus and desolvate
ions prior to introduction into the vacuum system. Ions from the ESI
are introduced to a single-bore glass capillary tube which is resistively
coated across its length, allowing the nebulizer to be maintained
at ground potential, while the exit end of the capillary can be biased
to around 2100 V.26 Ions exiting the capillary
are introduced into a tandem ion funnel interface consisting of a
high-pressure transmission ion funnel in the first stage,27 followed by a second stage trapping ion funnel
which incorporates a dual-grid ion gate.28 The second stage ion funnel trap operates as an ion focusing and
accumulation region whereby temporally narrow (typically 100 to 150
μs) ion pulses are gated into the IM spectrometer. Mobility
separation occurs in a 78 cm uniform field drift tube composed of
a series (ca. 150) of 50 mm internal diameter gold-plated
ring electrodes. The buffer gas is high purity nitrogen. Ions traverse
the drift tube under the influence of a weak electric field (10 to
20 V·cm–1) and consequently drift under low-field
conditions. The combination of extended drift length, precision electronics,
and high drift voltages enables high resolution ion mobility separations
in excess of 60 resolving power (t/Δt, observed for a +1 ion, m/z 294). Resolving power values can vary depending on the analyte charge
state and also the inherent structural rigidity of the ion and do
not depend on the class of molecules being investigated. Ions exiting
the drift region are refocused axially using an ion funnel and traverse
a differential pressure interface region by means of a resistively
coated hexapole ion guide. Following the hexapole, ions are introduced
into a modified Q-TOFMS (Agilent 6550), which incorporates a quadrupole
mass filter and collision cell to enable mass-selective ion fragmentation
experiments. The TOFMS is capable of greater than 40 000 mass
resolving power and can acquire MS spectra at a rate of up to 8.3
kHz (120 μs transients at m/z 1700). Additional instrumentation details are provided in Figure 1.

Experimental Parameters
All 2D IM-MS spectra were acquired
via direct infusion using positive mode electrospray ionization (Agilent
Jet Stream Source) with a flow rate of ca. 10 μL/min.
The Jet Stream source was operated with a nitrogen sheath gas temperature
between 400 and 600 K (solvent dependent) at a flow rate of 12 L/min.
Nitrogen drying gas applied at the source entrance was heated to ca. 570 K at a flow rate of 10 L/min. The source was operated
in positive mode with the following voltages: ground potential emitter,
−4.5 kV capillary entrance, and −1.8 kV nozzle. The
three ion funnels were operated as follows: high-pressure funnel RF
100 Vpp (peak-to-peak) at 1.5 MHz, 150 V DC; trapping funnel RF 100
Vpp at 1.2 MHz, 180 V DC; rear funnel RF 100 Vpp at 1.2 MHz, 200 V
DC. The IM drift gas pressure (nitrogen) was maintained at ca. 4 Torr and ca. 300 K, while the drift
potential varied from 750 to 1450 V, which represents an E/N ratio of 7 to 15 Td. In this E/N range, the mobility operates under low field
conditions as all analytes investigated exhibited a linear change
in drift times with respect to the electric field. Data was acquired
with a modified version of the MassHunter software (Agilent Technologies).
The mass measurement was calibrated externally using a series of homogeneously
substituted fluorinated triazatriphosphorines (Agilent tuning mixture, ca. 100 to 3000 m/z),
which are characterized as being amphoteric and nonreactive. Additionally,
a mixture of tetraalkylammonium salts (TAA3 to TAA18) was added to
all samples as an internal mass and mobility calibration standard
for positive mode analysis.

Collision Cross-Section Calculations
Uncorrected drift
times are extracted as centroid values using a beta version of the
IM-MS Browser (Agilent Technologies). This uncorrected drift time
represents the total transit time of the ions, including the mobility
drift time and the flight time through the interfacing IM-MS ion optics
and MS. Because the nonmobility flight time component (the transit
time of ions outside the drift region) is independent of the drift
voltage, this value can be determined from a plot of the measured
drift time versus the inverse drift voltage,29 where a linear fit to the data will indicate the nonmobility time
component (y-intercept) in the limit of infinite
electric field (1/V of zero). Time measurements are
obtained from a minimum of six different drift voltages, ranging from
750 to 1450 V. The determined nonmobility time is subtracted from
the uncorrected drift times in order to obtain the corrected ion mobility
drift time. Corrected drift times are used to determine the gas-phase
momentum transfer collision cross-section (CCS) using the Mason-Schamp
relationship,30 incorporating the scaling
terms for standard temperature and pressure. On the basis of a propagation-of-error
analysis incorporating the limits of precision for individual experimental
parameters, we estimate the accuracy of all CCS values to be better
than 2% (see Supporting Information).

Results and Discussion
Database Description and General Cross-Section
Trends in Nitrogen
A total of 594 nitrogen collision cross-section
values were measured
empirically in this study, representing three biomolecular classes
(lipids, carbohydrates, and peptides) and TAA salts. This includes
92 peptides, 125 carbohydrates, 314 lipids, and 63 TAA salts and TAA
salt derivatives. All CCS values were measured in positive ion mode,
and all represent singly charged analytes, of which 63 are molecular
ions, 111 are protonated species, 273 are sodiated, 124 are potassiated,
and the remaining representing other cations (lithium, rubidium, and
cesium). The range of CCS values measured spans from ca. 150 to 450
Å2, covering a mass range of ca. 150 to 2200 Da. Summary
statistics regarding the CCS database are provided in Table 1. The average RSD of all database values was 0.3%
(±0.1%), with each CCS value representing an average of 11 (±4)
measurements. A complete list of all analytes and respective CCS measurements
is provided as Supporting Information.

TAA salts ranging from tetrapropylammonium

compared with literature values in order to estimate the CCS measurement
accuracy.16 Results of this comparison
are summarized in Table 2. Where CCS literature
values existed for nitrogen, the absolute differences were found to
be less than 1% and, in most cases, less than 0.5% deviation was observed.
All TAA salts investigated exhibited excellent CCS measurement reproducibility
(less than 0.5% RSD).

A scatter plot of CCS versus m/z for all database values is presented
in Figure 2A, separated
into chemical
classes. We refer to this type of 2D IM-MS projection as conformational
space analysis,4,31 as the differential scaling of
mass (m/z) and size (CCS) between
molecular classes is indicative of differences in gas-phase packing
efficiency.20

Figure 2 (A) A scatter plot of
the CCS values measured in this study, separated
by chemical class. (B) Best fit lines of the data, separated into
class and fit to a power-law function. Also shown are data inclusion
bands representing ±5% deviation from the best fit line. The
inset bar graph represents the amount of data included within different
sized inclusion bands. Fit equations and their corresponding coefficients
of determination (R2) can be found in
Table 1.

Description of the Fits to the Empirical Data
Several
different equation functional forms were evaluated in order to determine
which expression best described molecular class correlations between
CCS and m/z values, and it was found
that the data sets were adequately described by a power-law relationship
(y = AxB), based upon the coefficient of determination (R2). Conceptually, power-law equations are descriptors
for several phenomena related to mass-size scaling, including allometric
scaling laws in biology,32 stellar velocity
dispersion relative to black hole mass (M-sigma relation),33 and the well-known square-cube law, first described
by Galileo,34 which universally relates
any shape’s increase in volume relative to its surface area.
Additionally, power-law relationships are scale-invariant such that
different power-law functions can be related by a simple scaling factor,
which has implications for describing universal relationships independent
of the specific details of the measurement.

The resulting power-law
fits to the empirical data are presented in Figure 2B. Coefficients and associated R2 values are summarized in Table 1. The data
inclusion bands projected in Figure 2B represent
±5% deviation from the line of best fit. Other inclusion band
sizes are summarized in Figure 2B, inset, averaged
across the four data sets. For all data sets, a ±5% inclusion
band incorporated an average of 94% (±4%) of data. Decreasing
the band to ±4% results in an average of 86% (±3%) of data
being included (a decrease of ca. 8% data inclusion),
whereas increasing the band to ±6% only incorporated an additional
3% (±2%) of data on average. Thus, the ±5% data inclusion
band represents an optimal balance between specificity and data incorporation.
Interestingly, the ±5% band describes all data sets similarly,
regardless of chemical class.

Several observations can be made
from the data contained in Figure 2. The TAA
salts were found to exhibit the highest
CCS values relative to m/z and were
located in a region of 2D IM-MS space which was disparate from the
biomolecules. Previously, TAA salts were recommended as an ion mobility
calibrant due to their low propensity for forming clusters, which
otherwise complicates the interpretation of mobility data.35 Here, it is found that, in addition to the lack
of clustering, the TAA salts are useful mobility-mass calibrants as
the complete series (1 to 18 carbons) span a wide range of CCS values
(107 to 400 Å2) and m/z values (75 to 1027 Da) and occupy a region of 2D IM-MS space where
biomolecules are not predicted to occur. Carbohydrates were observed
to have the lowest CCS values relative to their mass, while peptides
and lipids occupy similar regions of conformational space. In general,
all of the biochemical classes surveyed were readily separated above
a mass of ca. 1200 Da, indicating that differences
in relative gas-phase packing scale with molecular size and mass.

Extraction of Sub-Trend Information from the Data
From
a cursory analysis of the CCS database described in this report, it
is evident that the general chemical class information is retained
through the specific mobility-mass correlation trends in the 2D IM-MS
projection. While class separations are unambiguous at the higher m/z values (beyond ca. 1200), class-specific trend information is still largely retained
within the regions of overlap. For example, within the intermediate
region where the majority of signals occur (m/z 700 to 1000), the class-specific mobility-mass correlations
partition into distinct bands which can be subjected to a probability
distribution analysis for molecular class information (see, for example,
Figure S2, Supporting Information). The
molecular information derived from such trends holds promise for conducting
comprehensive omics experiments whereby unknown analytes originating
from a complex sample (e.g., blood, tissue, whole
cell lysate) can be prioritized on the basis of their likely chemical
class. This biomolecular filtering would allow for the sorting of
unknown analytes into distinct identification workflows, as lipid,
peptide, metabolite, and glycan identification methods often warrant
searching of specific databases. In order to determine the detail
of class-specific information obtained from the conformational space
analysis, select coarse biomolecular classes were further categorized
into finer specific subclasses. Figure 3 contains
a detailed analysis of carbohydrates, which were further delineated
into glycans (human milk oligosaccharides), cyclic dextrins (cyclodextrins),
and linear dextrins (maltose polysaccharides). Figure 3A,B illustrates the relative location of each carbohydrate
subclass in conformational space, while Figure 3C describes the data as a histogram relative to the best fit line.
In general, there is no strong correlation between the carbohydrate
subclasses, with all signals distributed in relatively the same locations
with respect to the power-law fit. This suggests that the carbohydrates
surveyed do not adopt strong structural differences which can be easily
differentiated in the 2D analysis. On the other hand, the subclasses
chosen here represent broad descriptors for carbohydrate structure
and as such are not structurally descriptive subclassifications. For
example, glycans can represent both linear and branched oligosaccharides
and thus occupy a broad region of the total carbohydrate conformational
trend. Interestingly, the cyclization of sugars (cyclodextrins) does
not seem to enhance gas-phase packing efficiency as compared with
their linear analogues. A more comprehensive carbohydrate data set
may engender subclass differentiation, or differences may bear out
for more limited situations such as positional and structural isomers
or various metal-coordinated species.36 It should also be noted that the data projected in Figure 2 includes various alkali cationized species. While
previous work has indicated that carbohydrate gas-phase ion structure
is strongly influenced by the cation,37 it is difficult to draw any definitive cation-specific effects in
this work due to the structurally diverse nature of the analytes (the
cation-specific carbohydrate analysis is provided in Figure S1, Supporting Information).

carbohydrates, with subclasses composed

A histogram analysis of carbohydrate subclass deviation in 2D IM-MS
space relative to the best fit line. In general, the carbohydrate
subclasses do not differentiate into distinct regions of conformational
space.

Application of a similar subclass
analysis to the lipid data set
is illustrated in Figure 4. In this case, the
lipid data set is substantially larger than the carbohydrate data
set (N = 314 vs N = 125, respectively),
and measurements were obtained from five distinct lipid structural
classes. These lipid subclasses can be broadly categorized into two
structural classes as sphingolipids (SM, GlcCer) and glycerophospholipids
(PE, PC, PS). It is qualitatively evident in Figure 4A,B that each class of lipid exists in a distinct region of
conformational space. The histogram distribution analysis in Figure 4C (right panel) indicates that sphingolipids fall
predominantly above the best fit line (97% in region 1), whereas glycerophospholipids
(Figure 4C, middle panel) are more broadly
dispersed around the mobility-mass correlation (33% in region 1, 65%
in region 2), and adopt denser gas phase conformations than sphingolipids.
These results suggest that, with proper structural subclass descriptors,
conformational space analysis is capable of differentiating finer
structural detail beyond general biomolecular class.

conformational space analysis.

Comparisons between Helium and Nitrogen CCS Values
The diverse
compilation of CCS values described in this report allows
for direct comparisons against helium-derived CCS values reported
in the literature. Of the over 3000 singly charged helium CCS values
surveyed from the literature, overlapping measurements exist for 119
nitrogen CCS values in the current database (8 TAA salts, 49 lipids,
38 peptides, and 24 carbohydrates; refer to Supporting
Information). Differences between helium and nitrogen-derived
CCS measurements have been previously noted for atomic species,38 small molecules, and peptides,39 and more recently, proteins and large protein complexes.9,23 Here, we add the differences observed for TAA salts, lipids, and
carbohydrates, in addition to corroborating previous peptide observations.

A scatter plot of the overlapping helium and nitrogen CCS values
is provided in Figure 5A. Vertical error bars
representing ±2% are also included, although this error is sufficiently
small such that most of the error bars are obscured within the scale
of individual data points. Figure 5B contains
the power fits to the data, which are useful in visualizing differences
between data sets. In general, gross separation trends between chemical
classes are retained within the helium and nitrogen-based data sets,
with qualitatively similar conformational space ordering being exhibited
regardless of the drift gas (i.e., carbohydrate density
> peptide density > lipid density > TAA salt density). Figure 5C contains the same overlap data as projected on
a plot of nitrogen versus helium CCS values. In Figure 5C, all of the class-specific data reside within the same region
of the projection, indicating that overall differences between helium
and nitrogen CCS are systematic within this range and thus can be
accounted for to allow conversion of one data set to another, with
some loss in precision associated with error propagation. This possibility
of generating effective helium-based CCS values from nitrogen measurements
was previously noted by Bush et al. for peptides and proteins.9,22 Recently, Pagel and Harvey noted good correlation (less than 1.5%
error) between helium and nitrogen CCS measurements for singly charged
carbohydrates, though significant error was introduced when multiply
charged values were incorporated into the calibration.17 Here, we confirm a strong correlation between
singly charged helium and nitrogen CCS values for lipids, peptides,
carbohydrates, and TAA salts. It should be cautioned, however, that
the relationship between helium and nitrogen-based CCS values are
both charge state and mass dependent,40 and it is expected that any correlation between the two measurements
would deviate at the extremes of low and high mass. In fact, Bush
et al. previously noted that cross-calibration error from nitrogen
to helium CCS is higher at lower masses (up to 15% error) where the
magnitude of the CCS value is small, while at higher masses, the error
can be reduced to as low as 2.2% for predicting helium CCS from nitrogen
measurements.9 It was also noted in this
study and elsewhere that calibration across different chemical classes
(e.g., using literature peptide values to calibrate
lipids14) introduces additional and significant
error (ca. 7%), further underscoring the importance
of compiling a chemically diverse set of empirical drift tube CCS
values. Figure 5C, inset, contains the linear
best fits to the data, with the axes rescaled to a region where data
exists for all four chemical classes. Linear fits are extrapolated
(dotted lines) for visualization purposes. Here, the small but notable
differences between chemical classes can be observed as offset correlation
lines, which corroborate the absolute CCS differences between helium
and nitrogen noted previously for each chemical class. Specifically,
peptides, carbohydrates, and lipids fall along a similar helium–nitrogen
CCS correlation trend, while the TAA salts exhibit a slightly lower
correlation. Interestingly, all class correlations exhibit similar
slopes (ca. 1), suggesting that the factors which
give rise to the cross-sectional differences between helium and nitrogen
(buffer gas size, mass, and polarizability) affect different chemical
classes in a similar manner across a broad range of both size and
mass.

helium and nitrogen. (B) Power fits to the data projected in panel
A. (C) Correlation plot of helium vs nitrogen CCS values. (D) Absolute
differences in CCS between helium and nitrogen measurements, plotted
as a function of mass-to-charge. In general, nitrogen CCS values are
significantly larger than helium, with subtle differences being observed
between different chemical classes.

Absolute CCS differences between the helium and nitrogen
data sets
are plotted as a function of mass in Figure 5D, with error bars representing ±2% CCS uncertainty. Average
absolute CCS differences are projected as a horizontal line through
each class distribution, with the following values: TAA salts, 58
(±3) Å2; lipids, 70 (±4) Å2; carbohydrates, 74 (±8) Å2; and peptides, 73
(±5) Å2. Cross-sectional differences are lowest
for the TAA salts, while lipids, carbohydrates, and peptides differ
by approximately the same amount. Overall, there is a small but notable
increase in the helium–nitrogen CCS difference with increasing
mass for all classes except lipids where a limited mass range is surveyed.
This suggests that the nitrogen and helium CCS are not increasing
at the same rate relative to the mass of the analyte, with the greater
CCS increase occurring in nitrogen. Wyttenbach et al. recently noted
that ion systems up to ca. 760 Da (sodiated PEG17) still exhibit strong contributions from the ion-neutral
interaction potential in their measured CCS.41 From their atomic superposition argument, it would be expected that,
with nitrogen buffer gas, the combined effect of each atomic potential
for large polyatomic systems would give rise to a steeper increase
in CCS than with helium buffer gas, since the atom–nitrogen
interaction potential is stronger than the atom–helium interaction
potential. In other words, the stronger interaction potential of nitrogen
would be expected to scale with the number of atoms in the ionic system
being measured, at least to a first approximation. Ion systems with
different heteroatom compositions (e.g., lipids vs
peptides) would also be expected to exhibit different scaling of mass
to CCS between helium and nitrogen; this effect cannot be definitively
observed in the relatively narrow mass range surveyed in this work,
though cursory effects of gas polarization seem to be present in the
enhanced high-mass separation of lipids and peptides in nitrogen vs
helium. Such class-specific CCS differences may bear out as more overlapping
measurements are obtained in future studies.

Conclusions
The large database of nitrogen-derived CCS values presented here
offers a glimpse at the intrinsic intermolecular packing forces of
four chemically different molecular classes across a relatively wide
range of both size (ca. 150 to 450 Å2) and mass (ca. 150 to 2200 Da). Four molecular
classes were investigated in this study, with relative gas-phase densities
observed as follows, from least to most efficient packing: TAA salts,
lipids, peptides, and carbohydrates. The biopolymers (carbohydrates
and peptides) demonstrated the highest efficiency for gas-phase packing,
and among these, carbohydrates tend to adopt the most compact gas-phase
CCS values. This observation is somewhat intuitive in that carbohydrates
have considerable degrees of freedom and can adopt both linear and
branched primary structures. In contrast, lipids exhibit the largest
CCS values among the biomolecules investigated, and this observation
appears to be intrinsic to the inability of lipids for forming compact,
self-solvated structures in the gas phase. Noteworthy among these
findings is that despite the significant differences between helium
and nitrogen in terms of mass, degrees-of-freedom (atomic vs diatomic),
and polarization, the biomolecular class trends observed here for
the nitrogen-based ion mobility are qualitatively the same as those
previously observed in helium.3,20 We do observe evidence
that these qualitative trends between the two drift gases are not
retained at low mass, and a more detailed investigation of helium
and nitrogen-based ion mobility studies for low mass analytes (less
than 200 Da) will be the subject of future studies.

We emphasize
that these studies are only possible by the remarkable
advances made over the past decade in the development of biological
IM-MS instrumentation. The IM-MS described in this report can achieve
high resolving powers with high sensitivity, making it possible to
observe and characterize low abundance isomeric species in highly
complex samples with unprecedented scale and throughput. While we
have purposely chosen to report only the highest abundant species,
we note that the observation of multiple ion mobility peak features
(i.e., structural and positional isomers) is routine
with this instrumentation. As the analytical capabilities of distinguishing
low-abundance isomeric species become widely accessible, we begin
to move toward a new paradigm whereby it no longer becomes the question
of if a particular isomer exists but rather how much of it is present
and in what context.
