The
aim of untargeted metabolomics is to profile as many metabolites
as possible, yet a major challenge is comparing experimental method
performance on the basis of metabolome coverage. To date, most published
approaches have compared experimental methods by counting the total
number of features detected. Due to artifactual interference, however,
this number is highly variable and therefore is a poor metric for
comparing metabolomic methods. Here we introduce an alternative approach
to benchmarking metabolome coverage which relies on mixed Escherichia coli extracts from cells cultured in
regular and 13C-enriched media. After mass spectrometry-based
metabolomic analysis of these extracts, we “credential”
features arising from E. coli metabolites
on the basis of isotope spacing and intensity. This credentialing
platform enables us to accurately compare the number of nonartifactual
features yielded by different experimental approaches. We highlight
the value of our platform by reoptimizing a published untargeted metabolomic
method for XCMS data processing. Compared to the published parameters,
the new XCMS parameters decrease the total number of features by 15%
(a reduction in noise features) while increasing the number of true
metabolites detected and grouped by 20%. Our credentialing platform
relies on easily generated E. coli samples
and a simple software algorithm that is freely available on our laboratory
Web site (http://pattilab.wustl.edu/software/credential/). We have validated the credentialing platform with reversed-phase
and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography as well as Agilent,
Thermo Scientific, AB SCIEX, and LECO mass spectrometers. Thus, the
credentialing platform can readily be applied by any laboratory to
optimize their untargeted metabolomic pipeline for metabolite extraction,
chromatographic separation, mass spectrometric detection, and bioinformatic
processing.

==== Body
The objective
of untargeted
metabolite profiling is to assay as many endogenous small molecules
in a biological sample as possible.1 Mass
spectrometry-based metabolomics represents an established analytical
platform that has been widely applied toward this goal and has already
yielded many fundamental biological insights.2−5 Nevertheless, experimental strategies
to maximize the number of metabolites profiled are still being developed.6−8 A major challenge in optimizing metabolomic methodologies has been
the difficulty in comparing the number of metabolites profiled in
each. Given that the size and identity of the complete metabolome
is unknown, it is currently not possible to assess metabolome coverage
directly. Consequently, the most common metric used to compare different
experimental approaches has been the number of features detected in
a sample.6,9−12

We show here that a method
detecting a maximal number of features
does not necessarily provide the greatest metabolome coverage. We
present a solution for the evaluation of untargeted metabolomic method
performance that enables us to distinguish between two types of features:
artifactual features and biologically derived features. Artifactual
features are peaks in metabolomic data that arise from contaminants,
chemical noise, and bioinformatic noise. In contrast, biologically
derived features are peaks that arise from metabolites in the biological
sample being analyzed. We refer to the process of distinguishing artifactual
features from features of biological origin as “credentialing”.
In the credentialing workflow (Figure 1), standard
samples are prepared from Escherichia coli grown in either natural-abundance media or uniformly 13C (U-13C) enriched media. After performing metabolomic
experiments utilizing the methods to be compared, our algorithm finds
and credentials features based on expected isotope-intensity ratios.
This number of credentialed features represents a more reliable metric
of metabolome coverage than total feature count because credentialed
features are known to be of biological origin and hence are representative
of true metabolites. Upon optimizing our bioinformatic workflow by
counting credentialed features, we reduce noise features by 15% and
increase properly detected and grouped features by 20%. Further, we
select several biological features for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)
analysis without any prior knowledge of their identity or physiological
significance. It is important to emphasize that the credentialing
platform described herein is not intended to identify differences
between various biological phenotypes (discovery profiling). Rather,
the credentialing platform is designed only to compare the performance
of different untargeted metabolomic methods. We provide a step-by-step
protocol for performing credentialing with E. coli. While other cell types could potentially be used, E. coli is a simple model system whose optimized
results will be applicable to the vast majority of metabolomic optimizations.

Figure 1 Overview
of the feature credentialing process. A sample is generated
from two cultures of E. coli grown
in parallel, one grown on natural-abundance glucose and a second grown
on 13C-glucose as the sole carbon source. These two cultures
are mixed in distinct ratios prior to harvesting, here 1:1 and 1:2.
Extraction and LC/MS analysis is then performed on the standard samples.
The resulting data are searched for pairs of coeluting peaks which
satisfy the following requirements: (i) the intensities of the peaks
must reflect the mixing ratio, (ii) the U-13C peak must
predict a feasible number of carbons for the mass in question, and
(iii) the exact masses of the peaks must predict an integer number
of carbons. These requirements define a “credentialed space”
in which the apex of a second peak must be found to qualify as an
acceptable isotope. These candidate peaks are then aligned and grouped
between the two samples. Each peak pair is compared across samples
and a second, stricter intensity check is performed. This requires
that the ratios of each sample (Ia12/Ia13 and Ib12/Ib13) are proportional to the mixed ratios of
each sample. Peaks that pass these filters are considered credentialed.

Background
Metabolomic studies are
complex, multistep experiments with a large
number of parameters to optimize. The choice of sample extraction,
chromatography, and ionization method strongly influences which metabolites
are detected. Establishing protocols which survey the broadest number
of metabolites during untargeted profiling has received detailed attention
in recent years.6,12−15 Previous studies have explored
a multitude of experimental variations to improve global metabolome
coverage that include the addition of ammonium fluoride and ion-pairing
reagents to chromatographic mobile phases, separation strategies ranging
from reversed-phase to hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography
(HILIC), different mass analyzers such as time-of-flight and the Orbitrap,
and various informatic software solutions for subsequent data processing.12,15−18 The extensive list of mutually exclusive experimental possibilities
is confounding, particularly to scientists just entering the field
of untargeted metabolomics. Yet, to date, comparisons of different
methods have been impractical because there is no robust metric for
performance evaluation.

Most published comparisons of mass spectrometry-based,
untargeted
metabolomic methods are evaluated by counting the total number of
features detected. A feature is defined as a peak in the metabolomic
data set with a unique retention time and mass-to-charge ratio. The
number of features detected depends on numerous factors including
sample type, metabolite extraction protocols, analyte separation,
mass analyzer, and bioinformatic processing. For liquid chromatography/mass
spectrometry (LC/MS)-based metabolomics, it is common to detect thousands
of features from a biological sample. Importantly, a single metabolite
often leads to many features19 due to:
(i) isotopic peaks from naturally occurring 13C, (ii) adduct
formation such as hydrogen, ammonium, and sodium adducts, (iii) neutral-loss
fragments (loss of a hydroxyl group as water or a carboxylate as carbon
dioxide), (iv) other fragmentation (breakage at labile bonds such
as esters), (v) multiple-charge states, and (vi) chromatographic effects
which result in a single metabolite eluting at more than one retention
time.

Informatic solutions have been established to annotate
isotopes,
adducts, and neutral losses in untargeted metabolomic data sets.17,20,21 Although these approaches are
effective, they cannot distinguish signals as endogenous or artifactual.
Thus, even after data reduction, a subset of the remaining features
are likely the result of contaminants introduced during sample preparation,
carryover from previous experiments, chemical noise, or bioinformatic
error. These highly variable artifactual signals found in untargeted
metabolomic data sets make it challenging to estimate the number of
true biologically derived metabolites that are assayed by a particular
untargeted LC/MS-based metabolomic experiment. There is therefore
a great need to develop a robust metric to the evaluate performance
of untargeted metabolomic methods.

Experimental Section
Our filtering process relies on the generation of standard samples
derived from a mixture of E. coli grown
on 100% natural-abundance glucose and E. coli grown on 100% U-13C-glucose as the sole carbon source.
Two standard samples are required for the filtering process; these
are generated by mixing natural-abundance E. coli cultures and U-13C-glucose E. coli cultures at either 5 mL/5 mL or 3 mL/6 mL ratios, respectively.
The mixed E. coli samples are then
extracted, yielding a standard
sample for analysis and optimization.

Materials
U-13C-d-Glucose was purchased
from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc. (Andover, MA). E. coli strain K12, MG1655 was purchased from ATCC
(Manassas, VA). Lennox LB broth powder, 5× M9 salts, and all
LC/MS-grade solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). Cell culture was performed with ultrapure water provided by a
Milli-Q system (Millipore).

Growth of E. coli Standards
Cultures were grown in a rotary shaker at 37
°C and 250 rpm.
A preculture of E. coli was grown in
LB broth for 16 h. Prior to inoculation, 3 mL of preculture was pelleted
and resuspended to OD600 = 0.6 in M9 salts. M9 salts were
prepared with the following concentrations in sterile Erlenmeyer flasks:
6.8 g/L Na2HPO4·7H2O; 3 g/L
KH2PO4; 1 g/L NH4Cl; 0.5 g/L NaCl;
240 mg/L MgSO4; 11 mg/L CaCl2. Salts were divided
into two 100 mL aliquots, and to each aliquot, 2 mL of 20% glucose
was added with a fresh-filtered syringe. The filter was rinsed with
2 mL of ultrapure water to ensure complete transfer of glucose. One
aliquot received U-13C-glucose and the second received
natural-abundance glucose. The M9 media was then inoculated with 1
mL of the resuspended preculture per 100 mL of media. Cultures were
grown to OD600 = 0.6, at which point they were harvested
as described below.

Harvesting of E. coli Standards
Upon reaching OD600 = 0.6, flasks
were removed from
the shaker and placed on ice. Appropriate volumes of the 12C and 13C cultures were pipetted together into 15 mL centrifuge
tubes, also on ice, generating samples with ratios of 1/1 of 1/2 12C/13C culture. These mixtures
established two distinct ratios of 12C to 13C feature intensities that could then be used in our credentialing
algorithm, described below. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation
at 2000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant
was removed via pipet, and the cell pellets were snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen. In addition to the mixed 12C and 13C cultures, natural-abundance (12C) cultures were used
as controls. We refer to the mixed samples as “labeled”
and the natural-abundance extracts alone as “unlabeled.”

Metabolite Extraction
The mixed E. coli pellets were extracted as previously described.6 Briefly, cells were lysed by three freeze–thaw cycles
in 2/2/1 methanol/acetonitrile/water along with sonication and vortexing.
The soluble portion was then vacuum concentrated and reconstituted
in 100 μL of 1/1 acetonitrile/water for LC/MS analysis.

LC/MS
Analysis
The data shown herein were obtained
from an Agilent 6540 UHD QTOF interfaced with an Agilent 1260 Capillary
LC. The column used for separation was a Phenomenex Luna NH2 (150 mm × 1 mm, 3 μm). HILIC solvents were A, 95% water
in acetonitrile with 10 mM ammonium acetate/10 mM ammonium hydroxide
(pH 9.8), and B, 95% acetonitrile in water. HILIC was performed at
45 μL/min with the following linear gradient (minutes, %B):
0, 100%; 5, 100%; 45, 0%; 50, 0%; 51, 100%; 60, 100%. For all experiments,
5 μL of extract was injected. MS parameters were as follows:
gas, 300 °C 9 L/min; nebulizer, 35 psi 1000 V; sheath gas, 350
°C 11 L/min; capillary, 3500 V; fragmentor, 175 V; scan rate,
1 scan/s.

To demonstrate the wide applicability of our credentialing
approach to other metabolomic platforms, we also analyzed our samples
and subsequently validated correct credentialing with multiple chromatographic
and mass spectrometrometric technologies. In addition to the Agilent
QTOF, we credentialed data from the Thermo QE, the AB SCIEX TripleTOF,
and the LECO Pegasus GC-HRT. Chromatographic methods we credentialed
include reversed-phase LC and HILIC. Effective parameters for credentialing
each of these experimental platforms are listed in the Supporting Information Table S-3.

Data Analysis
Analysis was performed with a custom
filtering script that utilizes the XCMS16 and CAMERA20 R22 packages as well as the METLIN23 database.
The script is available on our laboratory Web site at http://pattilab.wustl.edu/software/credential/. The algorithm identifies features of biological origin through
two rounds of data filtering, as depicted in Figure 1. Prior to filtering, features are detected from the MS raw
data with the XCMS findPeaks.centWave algorithm. In the first round
of filtering, coeluting peaks within a single sample are assessed
for potential isotopologue pairs differing by [(n)1.003355/z] Da in mass, where n is a whole number, z is the ion’s charge,
and the constant is the mass difference between 12C and 13C. Upper and lower bounds of n for each m/z in question were calculated from the
distribution
of mass per carbon number from the compounds in ECMDB24 (E. coli Metabolome Database, Supporting Information Figure S-2). The ratios
of the putative 12C and 13C peak intensities
are then evaluated. Each measured ratio that is not within a set percentage
of the mixture ratio of the 12C and 13C culture
is disqualified. For credentialing, the default value of 400% is effective.

The two filtered samples with distinct mixture ratios of 12C and 13C are then taken together for a final round of
filtering. Peaks from each sample are aligned and grouped. Surviving
features found in both samples are evaluated such that  where xi is the 12C/13C mixing ratio
of the ith sample, ri is intensity ratio (I12C/I13C) of the ith sample,
and e (ratio_tol) sets the acceptable
tolerance for the
intensity ratio relative to the mixing ratio. This two-round intensity
filter allows for features with varying 12C and 13C intensity ratios (due to the kinetic isotope effect or carbon fixation
of atmospheric CO2) to pass the relaxed first round and
stricter second round as long as their intensities vary systematically
between samples. All passing features are termed credentialed. Credentialed
features are output as a summary table that includes all U-12C peaks determined to be of biological origin.

Results and Discussion
Each step of the untargeted metabolomic workflow can introduce
artifactual signals that are not endogenous to the biological sample
being analyzed. It is generally not possible to discriminate features
of biological origin from artifactual features a priori, and thus,
artifactual signals significantly complicate interpretation of untargeted
metabolomic results. These artifactual signals can arise from sample
contamination during metabolite extraction, carryover from previous
experiments, background noise detected by the MS, or misannotation
of data during bioinformatic processing. While efforts are made to
minimize artifactual signals, it is not possible to completely eliminate
them from the features list. We therefore attempted to filter out
artifactual signals by using isotopic signatures of cellular metabolism
that are easily identified by informatic analysis. We utilized the
widely available and extensively characterized E. coli strain K12 to generate isotopically enriched biological extracts.
Two cultures were prepared in parallel, one containing 12C (natural-abundance) glucose and the other containing 13C glucose as the sole carbon source in M9 minimal media. The cultures
were mixed in defined ratios and processed through the metabolomic
workflow together. By searching the resulting features list for pairs
of unlabeled and fully labeled isotopologues and comparing their intensities
to the values expected from the culture volume ratios, signals of
biological origin can be distinguished from artifactual ones. The
output of the approach is a list of credentialed features arising
from the biological sample of interest. These features reflect the
extent to which the methodology employed was able to capture the metabolome.

The power of stable isotope labeling in conjunction with mass spectrometry
has long been leveraged to improve quantitative measurements. Mixing
labeled and unlabeled samples has proven to be an effective approach
to perform quantitation in proteomics,25−27 and similar approaches
have recently been extended to metabolomics.28 Mashego et al. developed “mass isotopomer ratio analysis
of U-13C labeled extracts” (MIRACLE) in which U-13C labeled metabolites obtained from yeast grown in defined
culture medium are mixed with unlabeled sample extracts to improve
quantitation.29 More recently, an innovative
variation of 12C–13C metabolite mixing
was developed in which cells are grown in either 5% or 95% randomly
enriched 13C glucose. This experimental strategy, termed
isotopic ratio outlier analysis or IROA, leads to a diagnostic isotopic
pattern for naturally occurring compounds that can be used for quantitation
and metabolite identification during untargeted profiling.30,31 Here, we introduce another experimental approach which involves
mixing 12C and 13C metabolic extracts. We then
use the unique isotopic signals that result from the metabolic transformation
of the label as a mechanism to identify features of biological origin.

Contrasting
the Credentialing and IROA Platforms
It
is worth distinguishing IROA from our credentialing approach. Fundamental
to the distinction is that mixing a natural-abundance sample with
a U-13C labeled sample in a single ratio does not provide
a specific enough signature to effectively discriminate features of
biological origin from artifactual features. IROA introduces additional
specificity to the isotopic pattern by enriching one sample with 5% 13C and a second sample with 95% 13C, instead of
using natural-abundance and U-13C samples. In contrast,
credentialing introduces additional specificity to the isotopic pattern
by mixing different ratios of natural-abundance and U-13C samples. In credentialing, one sample is made by mixing natural-abundance
and U-13C cells at a ratio of 1/1 and a second sample is
made by mixing natural-abundance and U-13C cells at a ratio
of 1/2. There are experimental benefits of each approach that make
the platforms better suited for each of their unique experimental
applications. IROA has been used to identify and quantitate differences
between biological phenotypes during untargeted profiling. Given that
the relative ratio of any given peak between biological phenotypes
is unknown during untargeted profiling, the credentialing strategy
based on defined ratios is incompatible with this type of discovery
analysis. The objective of credentialing, on the other hand, is to
identify features of biological origin exclusively from standard E. coli samples. While IROA could be used for this
purpose in principle, the credentialing platform is not constrained
by the aim of discovery analysis and therefore offers several advantages.
First, media needed to produce labeled E. coli samples for credentialing is easily synthesized in any laboratory,
whereas IROA media can only be obtained commercially. Second, the
credentialing platform is better suited to identify low-intensity
features of biological origin. In IROA, the signal intensity of any
given metabolite is shifted away from the U-12C peak and
the U-13C peak as a function of carbon number. For a metabolite
with 10 carbons, as an example, 50% of the signal intensity is lost
from the U-12C peak or the U-13C peak. This
decrease in signal intensity prevents low-abundance E. coli derived metabolites that are detected in
unlabeled samples from being detected with IROA. Because the credentialing
platform only uses natural-abundance and U-13C samples,
it is not subject to this limitation. Indeed, detection of low-abundance
metabolites is of particular importance when optimizing metabolomic
methods as these compounds are the most challenging to measure, but
can be of great biological importance. Finally, because credentialing
only uses E. coli samples, the analysis
of the resulting isotopic data can exploit the known relationship
between mass and carbon number derived from ECMDB (Supporting Information Figure S-2).

Parameters for Credentialing
To accomplish the filtering
of artifactual signals, we created a simple R package. The core function,
credential(), has several adjustable parameters allowing various chromatographic
and instrumental platforms to be credentialed. These parameters include
(i) iso_ppm, the ppm tolerance when searching for 13C isotopes,
(ii) iso_rt, the retention-time window in which a peak and its isotope
must elute, (iii) mix_tol, the tolerance for the intensity ratio of
the 12C and 13C peak, (iv) ratio_tol, the tolerance
for the ratio of the intensity ratios between two samples, and (v)
mpc_tol, the tolerance for compounds with unusually high or low mass
compared to the number of carbons they contain. (Details concerning
the calculation of mass per carbon based on the ECMDB can be found
in Supporting Information Figure S-2.)

We have determined effective parameters for reversed-phase and hydrophilic
interaction liquid chromatography as well as for the Agilent QTOF,
Thermo QE, AB SCIEX TripleTOF 5600+, and the LECO Pegasus
GC-HRT. These parameters have been experimentally validated and are
listed in the Supporting Information Table
S-3.

Evaluation of the filtering effectiveness was accomplished
by comparing
the number of credentialed features found in unlabeled and labeled
extracts. In addition to the labeled extracts, natural-abundance (unlabeled)
extracts were generated as controls. An unlabeled extract should have
no credentialed features if it is not mixed with a labeled extract.
Therefore, the number of passing features in an unlabeled extract
represents the false positive rate. Initial experiments indicated
that filtering based on a single mixed-extract sample was not sufficiently
selective to remove the majority of artifactual peaks. We found that
a two-sample, relative-intensity filter was most effective. As shown
in Table 1, this filtering process is selective.
The process credentialed only 0.6% of the negative-control features,
whereas 9% of the 12C/13C mixture features were
credentialed.

a A summary of
the results of the
credentialing process after being applied to several different data
sets. The rows labeled “no injection” and “extraction
blanks” represent credentialed peaks due to carryover from
previous credentialing runs. Natural-abundance E. coli is a negative control that estimates the false positive rate of
the credentialing process.

To further validate the filtering process, we examined the natural
isotopic peaks that were credentialed in our 12C/13C sample. Consider that in a 12C sample many peaks will
contain a natural-abundance M + 1 peak which by definition satisfies
the mass requirement to be an isotope. The filtering process credentials
some of these natural isotopes along with the monoisotopic peak. These
are easily detected and removed by established deisotoping methods,
but these peaks allowed us to assess how often an M + 1 is credentialed
when the M + 0 is not. If this occurs often, it would indicate that
the algorithm is inappropriately disqualifying features. We detected
385 credentialed natural isotopes in our mixture sample. Out of the
385 credentialed, natural isotopes only one did not have a corresponding
U-12C in the final credentialed features list. This indicates
the filtering approach is performing reliably.

Application: Reoptimization
of a Previously Published XCMS Method
With an established
method to credential features as biological
in origin and exclude various noise sources, we set out to optimize
our XCMS-based informatic workflow. XCMS is a widely used informatic
package suited for the analysis of untargeted LC/MS data sets. The
general XCMS workflow involves peak finding, peak grouping across
samples, and retention-time alignment. Settings for each step in this
process affect the quality of features returned and therefore the
overall performance of the untargeted metabolomic workflow. For example,
we found that settings for peak picking that cause the annotation
of spurious noise peaks as features lower the quality of peak grouping
and retention-time alignment (data not shown). Further, using poor
grouping parameters can lead to XCMS splitting a single peak into
multiple groups, thereby resulting in erroneous statistics.

To generate data for XCMS optimization, a previously published method
was replicated.6 The same LC/MS system,
extraction method, and chromatography protocols were utilized as published
and described in the Experimental Section.
When processing the data, however, we varied several parameters of
the XCMS functions findPeaks.centWave(), group(), and retcor(). As
the filtering depends on each of these functions, the final number
of credentialed features is representative of the quality of XCMS
data processing. Previous approaches to optimizing untargeted metabolomic
parameters such as these have relied on counting the total number
of features detected. Here, we applied our filtering approach to instead
count the number of credentialed features and use this as a benchmark
for parameter optimization. Our results show that the published method
parameters based on total number of features are suboptimal (Table 2). The published parameters do return a greater
number of total features, but the number of features of biological
origin accurately detected and grouped is substantially lower with
these settings. These data highlight that a larger feature number
does not necessarily indicate better metabolome coverage and therefore
an improved untargeted metabolomic method.

a Parameters used and the results
of each step in the optimization process are shown. Published parameters
were taken from a previously published method (ref (6)). The column labeled “with
optimized peak finding” shows results for the optimization
of findPeaks.centWave().

Reoptimization of XCMS parameters resulted in a substantial improvement.
Our XCMS parameters led to an increase of 20% in credentialed features
(an increase of 342 features), while reducing the total number of
features by 15% (a decrease of 4750 features). Parameters for findPeaks.centWave()
were determined to be the most critical to the analysis, while further
optimization of group and retcor qualified only an additional 41 peaks.
It is notable that, prior to optimizing findPeaks.centWave(), optimization
of group() parameters increased the number of credentialed features,
partially overcoming the negative impact of artifactual signals.

Characterizing Features in Untargeted Metabolomic Data Sets
To translate metabolomic data into biochemical insight, the features
generated in a typical untargeted experiment must first be structurally
characterized. The standard workflow for structurally characterizing
features requires matching MS/MS data of the features of interest
to the MS/MS data of authentic standards. Identifying features is
the most time-demanding step of the untargeted metabolomic workflow
and is generally performed in a targeted manner. That is, MS/MS data
are only acquired and interpreted for a handful of features determined
to be interesting, usually on the basis of statistical thresholds.
While this worfklow is often applied to identify tens of metabolites
in a metabolomic study, attempting to identify each of the thousands
of features detected in a typical sample with this approach is impractical.
New technologies to reduce the time required to establish metabolite
identifications are an active area of research, but high-throughput
methods to structurally characterize metabolites are not widely available.
Moreover, many of the MS/MS data are challenging to interpret. When
the MS/MS pattern of a feature does not match any of the MS/MS patterns
in metabolite databases, it is difficult to determine if the MS/MS
data correspond to an unknown metabolite or merely MS/MS data from
an artifactual feature.

The feature credentialing approach offers
a mechanism to rapidly filter features that should not be pursued
for identification, namely, those features that do not correspond
to signals of biological origin. When we applied credentialing to E. coli extract, we reduced the number of features
that represent candidates for MS/MS from 23 567 to 2192. The
resulting subset of credentialed features can be targeted for MS/MS
analysis with standard workflows. As an example, we performed targeted
MS/MS on 250 compounds in a single experimental run. These data illustrate
that MS/MS experiments could be performed on every feature of biological
origin over a minimal and feasible number of analytical runs. Select
data are presented in Figure 2A–C. The
MS/MS data collected on these features were matched to the METLIN
metabolite database and resulted in the identification of three metabolites:
uracil, ADP (adenosine diphosphate), and UDP-GlcA (uridine diphosphate
glucuronic acid). MS1 spectra and chromatograms for these
compounds can be found in Supporting Information Figure S-4.

Figure 2 MS/MS spectra from six representative credentialed features.
MS/MS
spectra were collected at four collision energies (0, 10, 20, and
40 V) on six credentialed ions. Three of these ions (A) uracil, (B)
ADP, and (C) UDP-GlcA were identified based on accurate mass, carbon
number, and METLIN database hits. These identifications were confirmed
by comparing the experimental MS/MS spectra to the METLIN MS/MS reference
spectra as shown. The upper spectrum of each plot is the experimental
data, and the lower spectrum is the METLIN reference data. Unmatched
peaks are depicted in red. The second three ions (D) 578.0093, (E)
1169.3011, and (F) 848.7473 were classified as unknowns as they did
not match any METLIN database entries as either a fragment or parent
mass. The MS/MS spectrum of each ion is displayed as normalized intensity
at the same four collision energies.

In addition to generating MS/MS data for metabolites included
in
databases, it is possible to reliably generate MS/MS data on biological
peaks which currently cannot be annotated by metabolomic databases.
Because credentialed features have passed our filtering rounds, we
know that they are true metabolites of biological origin even if they
do not return any database hits. Of the 1827 credentialed features,
392 were not found in METLIN or the METLIN fragment databases. Three
such example features are seen in Figure 2D–F.
Previously these features may have been discarded as artifacts, but
the credentialing platform provides confidence in their authenticity
such that they can be reported and referenced in future experiments.

Conclusion
The feature credentialing strategy presented
here is a powerful
platform to discriminate biological features from the various noise
sources prevalent in untargeted metabolomic data. The process is experimentally
straightforward and can be easily implemented in any metabolomic laboratory.
Feature credentialing reliably removes artifactual features such as
those arising from chemical and informatic noise, thereby resulting
in a valuable list of features of biological origin. These credentialed
features address many of the drawbacks associated with feature counting
in comparing method performance on the basis of metabolome coverage.
As such, counting credentialed features can be used in the development
and optimization of untargeted metabolomic approaches as demonstrated
by the reoptimization of XCMS parameters. Credentialing features is
also an effective data reduction strategy for untargeted metabolomic
results such that a smaller number of peaks can be targeted for MS/MS
analysis. In summary, the feature credentialing platform introduced
here represents a step toward defining optimal untargeted metabolomic
platforms and provides a standard metric to facilitate collaboration
between different metabolomic laboratories.
