Secondary ion mass
spectrometry (SIMS) and confocal Raman microscopy
(CRM) are combined to analyze the chemical composition of cultured Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, providing complementary
chemical information for multiple analytes within the sample. Precise
spatial correlation between SIMS and CRM images is achieved by applying
a chemical microdroplet array to the sample surface which is used
to navigate the sample, relocate regions of interest, and align image
data. CRM is then employed to nondestructively detect broad molecular
constituent classes—including proteins, carbohydrates, and,
for the first time, quinolone signaling molecules—in Pseudomonas-derived biofilms. Subsequent SIMS imaging at
the same location detects quinolone distributions in excellent agreement
with the CRM, discerns multiple quinolone species which differ slightly
in mass, resolves subtle differences in their distributions, and resolves
ambiguous compound assignments from CRM by determining specific molecular
identities via in situ tandem MS.

==== Body
Biological
systems are comprised
of a vast, diverse assortment of chemical species, ranging in size
and complexity from monatomic electrolytes up to massive biopolymers
such as proteins, complex carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. Since
function arises not just from what components are
present in a system, but also how they are distributed
spatially (and temporally), visualizing their distribution via chemical
imaging is critical to gaining a comprehensive understanding of biological
function. Although analyte labeling (e.g., with fluorescent dyes or
radioisotopes) is one, well-established way to accomplish this, label-free
imaging offers an alternative approach with several advantages: effective
probes need not be developed for each analyte, nor must the system
be perturbed by the introduction of exogenous compounds, and parallel
imaging of multiple analytes is not limited by the number of simultaneously
usable and/or detectable probes.

Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI)1−3 and confocal Raman microscopy
(CRM)4−6 are two label-free molecular imaging techniques that
operate on different fundamental principles. MSI detects and visualizes
analyte distribution on the basis of molecular weight. This is commonly
done by scanning a microprobe across the sample surface and ionizing
constituents in a spatially registered fashion, which can then be
analyzed, detected, and used to generate ion images or maps of relative
abundance.1 A variety of MSI microprobes
are available, each with unique characteristics and advantages; two
of the most common are focused lasers for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
(MALDI),3 which provides a high upper mass
range, and focused ion beams for secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS),7,8 which provides high spatial resolution, down to <100 nm in ideal
cases.9 In contrast to mass-based detection
by MSI, CRM visualizes chemical distributions based on the characteristic
vibrational frequencies of different chemical functional groups. In
the Raman scattering process, these vibrational frequencies shift
scattered light away from the frequency of an incident laser beam
by an amount that is characteristic of the functional groups present.
CRM utilizes a standard confocal microscope; therefore, the lateral
and axial spatial resolutions are defined by Δx = 0.61λ/NA and Δz = (2.2nλ)/(π(NA)2), respectively, where λ represents
laser wavelength, NA is the numerical aperture of the microscope objective,
and n is the refractive index of the medium.10,11 Image acquisition is performed by scanning the focal volume of the
laser, which allows for nondestructive (and therefore potentially
live sample) imaging in three dimensions at submicrometer-scale spatial
resolution.6,12

Given the orthogonality
of these techniques, combining MSI and
CRM (or other vibrational imaging methods) for molecular imaging can
be advantageous. More specifically, correlating mass
and vibrational images by chemically imaging the same location using
orthogonal detection modes imparts numerous benefits for biological
studies, beyond their combined individual application. Molecules that
do not ionize efficiently may produce a strong vibrational signature
or vice versa; thus, by combining both methods, chemical
coverage is expanded. One technique may be used to resolve subtly
differing compounds that are indistinguishable by the other, for example
structural isomers with different vibrational modes (e.g., CRM) or
functionally similar molecules with slightly different masses (e.g.,
MSI). In cases where an analyte is mutually detectable by both CRM
and MSI, observed distributions can be cross-validated;13 this is especially helpful in MSI experiments
where artifacts can arise in ion images due to ion suppression14,15 or image processing.16

Several
reports have illustrated the advantage of combining MSI
with CRM or related vibrational imaging techniques for biological
analysis, a subject we also reviewed in depth recently.17 Li et al.13 correlated
CRM, SIMS, and laser desorption ionization (LDI) MSI to elucidate
the subcellular localization of carbohydrates (cellulose and hemicellulose)
in biofuel feedstock grass, allowing more definitive mass and vibrational
assignments from mutually observed chemical features. Petit and co-workers18 demonstrated that synchrotron-Fourier transform-infrared
(FT-IR) and -ultraviolet microspectroscopies and SIMS imaging could
be combined for liver tissue analysis, with FT-IR used to visualize
broad molecular classes (lipids, proteins, DNA, and sugars) and SIMS
to resolve specific lipid species. More recently, Fagerer et al.19 combined single cell fluorescence and Raman
imaging with MALDI mass spectrometry (MS) profiling of algae in order
to visualize secondary metabolite production and the associated depletion
of cellular adenosine triphosphate, impressively demonstrating how
combining these techniques can yield a more comprehensive biological
picture. Finally, a landmark-based histology registration strategy
was developed for semiautomated alignment between MALDI-time-of-flight
(TOF) and Raman imaging platforms by Bocklitz et al.20

Here, we present a method for correlating molecular
images obtained
from two label-free techniques, SIMS and CRM, and demonstrate how
their complementarity can be exploited for enhanced molecular imaging
of a biological sample. We applied the approach to investigate cultured
bacterial biofilms of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. Unlike tissue sections, which are commonly used
in imaging studies, bacterial biofilms do not present obvious anatomical
features for image registry. Thus, we also developed a chemical microspot-based
system for navigating and locating microscopic regions of interest
(ROIs), a critical step in precisely correlating images acquired on
a highly uniform surface using two different techniques and two separate
instruments (at two institutions). The correlation of MSI and CRM
data enabled us to broadly characterize the chemical composition of
the biofilm microenvironment as well as specific constituent analytes
including quinolones, a class of signaling molecules involved in Pseudomonas biofilm growth and maturation.

Experimental
Section
A schematic representing the overall workflow of
the sequential
correlated imaging approach demonstrated in this work is shown in
Figure 1, with procedural details described
below.

and array coordinates are recorded. (c) The sample is transferred
to the SIMS instrument, and the array is used to navigate back to

Materials and Chemicals
Silicon substrates were purchased
from Silicon, Inc. (Boise, ID) as 4-in-diameter wafers of Si (100),
then scored and broken into 2 × 2 cm2 tiles before
use. Two quinolone standards, 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone (Pseudomonas quinolone signal, PQS) and 2-heptyl-4-quinolone
(HHQ), were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO) and dissolved
in HPLC-grade methanol (Sigma-Aldrich), then deposited and air-dried
on clean Si wafers for the SIMS and CRM measurements. The Ag nanoparticle
solution (PELCO NanoXact, 50 nm, 0.02 mg/mL in 2 mM aqueous citrate)
was purchased from Ted Pella, Inc. (Redding, CA) and diluted 1:1 with
HPLC-grade methanol for inkjet printing.

Biofilm Preparation
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, “wild type”
ATCC strain 15692 (ATTC, Manassas, VA)
was used for all experiments. Cell suspensions were grown in fastidious
anaerobe broth (FAB) culture medium with filter-sterilized glucose
as a carbon source at 30 °C overnight. The FAB medium contained
the following components: (NH4)2SO4 (2 g L–1), Na2HPO4·2H2O (6 g L–1), KH2PO4 (3 g L–1), NaCl (3 g L–1), MgCl2 (93 mg L–1), CaCl2 (11 mg L–1), and trace metals solution (1 mL L–1). The trace metals solution contained CaSO4·2H2O (200 mg L–1), FeSO4·7H2O (200 mg L–1), MnSO4·H2O (20 mg L–1), CuSO4·5H2O (20 mg L–1), ZnSO4·7H2O (20 mg L–1), CoSO4·7H2O (10 mg L–1), NaMoO4·H2O (10 mg L–1), and H3BO3 (5 mg L–1). The cell culture solution was deposited
onto the silicon wafer tiles placed at the bottom of Petri dishes
and additional growth culture medium added to a 50× dilution.
The biofilms were allowed to grow under static conditions at 30 °C
for 72 h. The culture mixture was then removed by pipet, and biofilms
were permitted to air-dry fully in sterile conditions prior to microspotting
and analysis.

Microdroplet Array Application
The
Ag nanoparticle
solution was printed onto dried biofilm surfaces with a ChIP-1000
Chemical Inkjet Printer (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). A single 100
pL droplet was dispensed at each position in a 500-μm pitch
array across the entire biofilm surface. Visual monitoring during
deposition and measurement via SIMS confirmed that droplets formed
single 132 ± 9 μm (n = 6) diameter spots
and did not spread on the biofilm surface. To use the array as a Cartesian
coordinate grid, an origin was designated at one corner of the tile
by inscribing a small unique feature into the biofilm with sharp tweezers.

CRM
Raman microscopy was performed on an Alpha 300R
confocal Raman microscope (WITec GmbH, Ulm, Germany) with a 60×,
NA = 1.0 coverslip-corrected water immersion objective (Nikon Corp.,
Tokyo, Japan) employing a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser (λ
= 532 nm) delivered through a single-mode optical fiber, dichroic
beam splitter, and focused onto the surface of the sample using a
microscope objective operating in epi-illumination geometry. The backscattered
radiation was transmitted through a 50-μm diameter multimode
fiber to a UHTS 300 spectrometer with a 600 groove mm–1 diffraction grating and back-illuminated CCD camera cooled to −65
°C (Newton DU970 N–BV, Andor Technology Ltd., Belfast,
UK). The incident laser power on the sample was adjusted to 10 mW.
Raman spectra were recorded by accumulating 100 spectra at an integration
time of 500 ms per spectrum. Images were acquired by collecting a
full Raman spectrum at each image pixel (100 × 100 spectrum array
per image) with a 100 ms integration time per pixel. Raman chemical
images were generated by using a sum filter, which integrates the
signal intensity over a defined wavenumber range that is representative
of the molecular species of interest and subtracts the background
as a linear baseline from the first to second border as defined by
the sum filter. Data analysis on the Raman images was performed using
WITec Project 2.1 software (WITec GmbH, Ulm, Germany), and Raman spectra
were processed using Igor Pro 6.32A (Lake Oswego, OR).

MSI
MS experiments were performed on a customized hybrid
MALDI/C60-SIMS Q-TOF mass spectrometer, described in detail
elsewhere,21 operated in positive ion/C60-SIMS mode. This instrument is a modified version of the
QSTAR XL (AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA) featuring a 20 kV DC C60 primary ion beam for SIMS, a translational sample stage that enables
imaging experiments, tandem MS (MS/MS) capability via collision induced
dissociation (CID), and high mass resolution (R >
10 000). C60+ was selected for the primary
beam, operated with a 70 pA DC sample current and a ∼15-μm
spot diameter. MS mode acquisition parameters were optimized for detection
of quinolones and other small metabolites, collecting m/z 100–300 with ion guide Q1 transmission
biased to the upper half of this range (25% at m/z 120, 75% at m/z 200).
MS/MS was performed with 10 eV CID (collision induced dissociation)
and Ar in the collision cell. MSI was performed in two modes: “step-mode”
in which the probe is centered at each discrete pixel location for
a specified accumulation time before stepping to the next position
and “continuous raster mode” in which the probe is continuously
moved across the sample in a horizontal line scan to acquire each
row of the image. This allowed images to be acquired several-fold
faster but limited spatial resolution and accumulation time. Step-mode
acquisition was performed at 10 × 10 μm2 pixel/step
size and 1 s/pixel, while rastering was performed at 20 × 20
μm2 pixel size and 0.25 s/pixel. In both cases, the
ion dose was well beyond the traditional static limit (1 × 1012 primary ions cm–2 s–1); the step mode dose is estimated at ∼2.5 × 1014 primary ions cm–2 s–1, corresponding
to an etch rate of ∼200 nm/s based on atomic force microscopy
measurements in similar previous work,22 assuming similar sputter rates. Data were acquired with Analyst
v1.2 and oMALDI Server v5.1 software (AB SCIEX), and images were converted
to .img files at 20 bins/AMU for processing in BioMap (Novartis, Switzerland).
The ion images shown here represent signal intensity (counts) in each
pixel with a “thermal” false-color scale ranging from
black (no signal) through red to white (high signal). Coating the
biofilms with metal (1–2 nm of sputtered Au) was found to suppress
rather than enhance biological ions, so biofilms were untreated prior
to imaging, aside from the microspot application. Mass calibration
was performed with indium/indium oxide clusters.

Scanning Electron
Microscopy (SEM)
SEM was performed
on an environmental scanning electron microscope (Philips XL30 ESEM-FEG,
Philips/FEI Co., Hillsboro, OR) operating at 2 kV electron beam energy,
2.4 nm spot size, and 8.7 mm working distance. Biofilm samples were
analyzed without surface modification (i.e., standard metal coating)
in order to avoid generating artifact features on the biofilm surface.

Results and Discussion
Biofilm Profiling with CRM and C60-SIMS
Prior to the imaging experiments, a biofilm sample
was profiled by
CRM and C60-SIMS individually to determine the compositional
coverage and overlap of the two techniques. A typical Raman spectrum
acquired from the biofilm is shown in Figure 2a. Vibrational bands characteristic of known biofilm components can
be assigned based on previous work,23 prominently
including: (1) a band at 1005 cm–1 (band i shown
in Figure 2a), assigned to symmetric ring vibrations
in tryptophan and phenylalanine, and 1605 cm–1 (band
iv), arising from C=C stretching vibrations in phenylalanine,
both representative of proteins;24 and
(2) bands at 1034 cm–1 (band ii) and 1163 cm–1 (band iii) in the carbohydrate region of the spectrum,
attributed to C–O stretching vibrations with contributions
from in-plane C–H deformations in phenylalanine (1034 cm–1) and C–C, and C–O asymmetric ring vibrations,
characteristic of carbohydrate moieties.25,26 At some sample locations, a strong band at 1370 cm–1 (band v in Figure 2b) was also observed.
This vibration, a common feature in quinolone-associated spectra,26,27 is tentatively assigned to a ring-stretching vibration in quinolones,27 a known P. aeruginosa secondary
metabolite class28 detected in biofilms
by MS in recent work from our laboratories,29 and from cultured colonies in the work of others,30 but not previously reported by Raman spectroscopy. Raman
spectra acquired from ROIs marked by the 1370 cm–1 quinolone-associated peak also exhibited bands characteristic of
ring vibrations at 1155 cm–1, arising from C–C
and C–N asymmetric ring breathing vibrations,31 as well as CH deformation vibrations near 1460 cm–1,27,32,33 a vibration
at 1557 cm–1 (band vi), and another at 1600 cm–1 (band vii), attributed to aromatic C=C stretching.33 Other significant vibrations arose from C=O
stretching at 1650 cm–1,26,33 and CH bending and CH twisting, giving rise to a wide band centered
near 1210 cm–1,34 and
CH in-plane bending at 1256 cm–1.31,34 Figure 2b compares the Raman spectrum acquired
from a quinolone-rich biofilm region overlaid with a spectrum acquired
from a purified PQS standard. The similarity of the two spectra is
striking, with the 1155, 1370, 1462, 1557, and 1600 cm–1 bands well-matched between the 1370 cm–1 ROI and
the PQS standard. Raman profiling of a second quinolone standard (HHQ, Figure S1) produced a similar vibrational profile.
Thus, the concordance of a number of peaks with known quinolone species
is strong evidence for assigning these spectra to the quinolone class,
although it is not possible to definitively distinguish between PQS
and HHQ based on Raman imaging alone.

Figure 2 CRM spectral profiles of P. aeruginosa biofilm.
(a) CRM profiling of a P. aeruginosa biofilm detects
multiple biomolecular classes by characteristic vibrations, including
(i) 1005 cm–1 from symmetric ring-breathing vibrations
of phenylalanine and tryptophan (indicating proteins), (ii) 1034 cm–1 from C–O stretching of carbohydrate moieties
with contributions from in-plane C–H deformations in phenylalanine,
(iii) 1163 cm–1 from C–C and C–O asymmetric
ring-breathing vibrations of carbohydrates, and (iv) 1605 cm–1 C=C stretching in phenylalanine. (b) Comparison of a quinolone-rich
biofilm ROI (black trace) with a purified commercial PQS standard
(red trace) reveals several matching vibrations, including (v) 1371
cm–1 quinolone ring stretch, (vi) C–C and
C–N–C associated quinolone ring stretches, and (vii)
1603 cm–1 symmetric C=C stretching in the
quinolone ring. Dotted vertical lines are added to facilitate comparison.
All Raman spectra are baseline corrected using a fourth order polynomial
function.

Quinolones are known secondary
metabolites observed in several
dozen unique species. They function as cell signals, virulence factors,
and redox mediators, among other roles in P. aeruginosa,35 and, thus, are analytes of particular
interest. Although most quinolones have not been functionally characterized,
we recently observed cell-scale spatial distributions of quinolones
on P. aeruginosa biofilms29 that may relate to their unique functions, and so we chose to focus
on these analytes here.

To complement the CRM images, C60-SIMS was conducted
in a semitargeted manner, i.e., the acquisition parameters were optimized
for detection of quinolones and other small metabolites in the <300
AMU range. A detail of the P. aeruginosa biofilm
MS profile is shown in Figure 3a; quinolones
were consistently detected as MH+ ions, in agreement with
previous reports,28,30 as well as with our own recent
observations using MSI with other probe types (metal-assisted LDI
and Au-SIMS, validated by CE–ESI MS/MS). Assignments were initially
made by mass match with previous reports, and in situ MS/MS was also performed to confirm identities when signals were
adequate, as shown for HHQ in Figure 3b and
for other analytes in Table S1. A total
of nine quinolones were detected and confirmed with MS/MS, including
two isobaric quinolone pairs—PQS/HQNO and C9:1-PQS/C9:1-NQNO—yielding unique characteristic fragments. A
mass list summary of these results is presented in Figure S2.

Figure 3 C60-SIMS and MS/MS of biofilm. (a) C60-SIMS
direct analysis of an untreated biofilm surface yielded a profile
that included multiple quinolones detected as MH+ pseudomolecular
ions. (b) In situ MS/MS of putative quinolones supports
the mass assignments, e.g., for HHQ at m/z 244.17 shown here, yielding characteristic fragments at m/z 159.07 and 172.08.

Correlated C60-SIMS/CRM Imaging
Following
characterization, CRM and C60-SIMS were combined to investigate
the biofilm surface via correlated imaging. Owing to the relatively
large sample area (∼2 × 2 cm2) and limited
imaging fields of view (<150 × 150 μm2 for
CRM when working at 60× magnification), it is challenging to
ensure precise sample navigation, reliable relocation of microscopic
CRM ROIs for subsequent MSI, and proper alignment of imaged regions
for precise spatial registry of the CRM and MSI data. To address these
issues, we developed a fiducial array approach, wherein 100 pL droplets
of an Ag nanoparticle solution were dispensed in a Cartesian grid
(500-μm pitch) across the sample surface. Once dried, the nanoparticle
spots were visible in optical, MS, and electron microscope images
and could therefore be used to register spatial locations across these
distinct imaging modes (the CRM microscope was operated in bright
field mode for sample navigation and visualization of microspots).
An origin was specified at one corner of the sample, and then features
could be located to within a single “cell” of the grid
using an (x,y) coordinate axis.
The array also served as a visual indicator of sample alignment while
remounting in a holder for MSI after CRM.

Figure 4 Correlated SIMS/CRM imaging
provides additional information about
signaling molecules in P. aeruginosa biofilm. (a)
Superimposed CRM “composite quinolone” image (1350–1400
cm–1, quinolone ring stretch) and SIMS 2-heptyl-2-quinolone
ion image (HHQ, MH+ at m/z 244.17) shows a similar molecular distribution in the selected ROI.
The same images are shown individually for (b) SIMS and (c) CRM, where
high spatial resolution enables visualization of micron-scale features
within the ROI. (d) Another quinolone, 4-hydroxy-2-nonylquinolone-N-oxide
(C9–NQNO, MH+ at m/z 288.20) appears to be colocalized, but the distribution
is distinct from that of HHQ within the composite quinolone area.
(e) Optical and (f) SIMS ion images (m/z 250.81) with a larger field of view show how the microspot array
is visualized around the ROI, allowing precise navigation and image
alignment. Red boxes specify the ROI of the CRM/SIMS detail. Scale
bars = 100 μm in a–d and 200 μm in e and f.

Results from a correlated imaging
experiment are shown in Figure 4. CRM is performed
first as it is nondestructive,
thus providing a good way to survey the sample. A region with intense
micrometer-scale quinolone features was found and imaged by CRM; the
sample was then physically transferred to the C60-SIMS
instrument where the ROI was relocated using the microspot array.
MSI was performed over the entire grid cell, which included the CRM-imaged
ROI. Figure 4a shows the CRM “composite
quinolone” image aligned and superimposed with the SIMS ion
image of quinolone HHQ (MH+ at m/z 244.17). The two images are in excellent agreement in
spatial distribution and relative signal intensity within the feature,
cross-validating the data and indicating that the observed ion and
Raman scattering distributions are accurate, not artifactual (e.g.,
arising from ion suppression effects or similar vibrational modes
in other biofilm constituents). The individual SIMS and CRM images
are also shown separately in Figure 4b and
c, respectively. The microspots around the ROI are visible in the
optical image, Figure 4e, and are also detected
as intense spots in several ion images, including m/z 250.81, Figure 4f, and
in the total ion count, Figure S3. These
marker ions were not identified, but they are likely adduct or inorganic
cluster ions formed or enhanced by the presence of the Ag nanoparticles
and/or the citrate buffer. Notably, ions associated with the microspots
did not include silver clusters such as Ag+ or Ag2+, perhaps indicating that the silver was extensively
associated with other compounds, or that the nanoparticles were not
sufficiently fragmented by the C60+ primary
ion beam. The spots are well-defined against the biofilm background,
indicating that the nanoparticle solution dried into discrete 132
± 9 μm (n = 6) diameter regions without
diffusing into the adjacent sample.

The nanometer-scale spatial
resolution provided by CRM here is
complemented by the chemical specificity of the correlated SIMS data,
which enabled detection of at least nine quinolones and additional
related metabolites present in and around the ROI (images shown in Figure S3). This allowed unique distributions
of specific quinolone species to be discerned, as observed with C9–NQNO (MH+ at m/z 288.20), shown in Figure 4d. Note
that the distribution of this quinolone still falls within the composite
quinolone distribution observed by CRM, based on the common frequency
of the quinolone ring vibration, though the distributions of the two
quinolones within that feature differed. We also observed an interesting
trend between two quinolone subclasses in the SIMS data; the two detected
3-hydroxyquinolones (PQS at m/z 260.17
and C9–PQS at m/z 288.20) were similarly distributed in patches throughout the ROI,
in contrast with the other (non-3-hydroxy) 4-quinolones, which were
mostly concentrated in the ROI itself. Fragment ions characteristic
of these classes, m/z 175/188 from
3-hydroxyquinolones and m/z 172/159
from 4-quinolones, reflected similar distributions (shown in Figure S4), further validating these mass assignments
and the associated distributions. The significance of such a distribution
is not apparent but suggests yet to be determined differences in the
biological function of the quinolone classes.

SEM of the Correlated Imaging
of a ROI
To investigate
the physical nature of the quinolone “hotspots” that
were observed by CRM and SIMS, SEM was performed following a combined
imaging experiment. The resulting optical, CRM, SIMS, and SEM images
are shown in Figure 5. The SEM image of this
area reveals single cells exposed in patches on the biofilm, in contrast
with a uniformly smooth biofilm surface elsewhere (shown in Figure S5). The cells are consistent in size
with the quinolone features observed in the CRM image and also with
the typical P. aeruginosa cell size (1–2 μm)
and shape. In addition to detection of quinolones here, SIMS images
show colocalization of phosphocholine (PC, M+m/z 184.08), a cell membrane phospholipid fragment.
Detection of PC from the outer membranes of the exposed cells in this
area is a likely explanation that would fit with the correlated SEM
and CRM data, suggesting that quinolone “hotspots” may
consist of perturbed biofilm regions where cells have been exposed.

suggest a chemical ROI at the edge of the biofilm; the CRM location

field of view shows a rough patch and micrometer-sized single cells

Conclusions
We report a method that combines two label-free
molecular imaging
techniques, CRM and MSI, and we demonstrate its utility with the analysis
of metabolites on P. aeruginosa bacterial biofilms.
A chemical microspot array printed on the sample allows precise navigation,
relocation of analysis regions, and alignment of correlated image
data. CRM enables nondestructive imaging with submicrometer spatial
resolution of secreted quinolones and detection of multiple biomolecule
classes and enables imaging with submicrometer spatial resolution
of secreted quinolones. MSI with C60-SIMS allows mass-based
discrimination of multiple specific quinolone species having subtly
differing distributions, as well as confirmation of mass assignments
with in situ MS/MS experiments. SEM of the imaged
regions reveals that quinolone concentrations detected with SIMS and
resolved by CRM correlate with single cells exposed on the biofilm
surface; thus our CRM-MSI imaging approach may serve as an effective
platform for in situ single cell metabolomics experiments
in future work.

Ongoing efforts include incorporating the MALDI
mode of the hybrid
mass spectrometer used here in order to detect larger molecules, such
as proteins and polysaccharides, in conjunction with high resolution
CRM and SIMS imaging. We are also adapting sample preparation techniques
to enable correlated 3D imaging with CRM and SIMS in order to explore
the complex native 3D biofilm structure, as well as transitioning
from bacterial monoculture to plant-microbe cocultures in order to
study metabolic exchange at the biological interface. Finally, while
image alignment was performed manually here, future improvements will
include automatic image alignment using the novel microspot array
approach developed for this study.
