There is a large
unmet need for reliable biomarker measurement
systems for clinical application. Such systems should meet challenging
requirements for large scale use, including a large dynamic detection
range, multiplexing capacity, and both high specificity and sensitivity.
More importantly, these requirements need to apply to complex biological
samples, which require extensive quality control. In this paper, we
present the development of an enhancement detection cascade for surface
plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi). The cascade applies an antibody
sandwich assay, followed by neutravidin and a gold nanoparticle enhancement
for quantitative biomarker measurements in small volumes of complex
fluids. We present a feasibility study both in simple buffers and
in spiked equine synovial fluid with four cytokines, IL-1β,
IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α. Our enhancement cascade leads
to an antibody dependent improvement in sensitivity up to 40 000
times, resulting in a limit of detection as low as 50 fg/mL and a
dynamic detection range of more than 7 logs. Additionally, measurements
at these low concentrations are highly reliable with intra- and interassay
CVs between 2% and 20%. We subsequently showed this assay is suitable
for multiplex measurements with good specificity and limited cross-reactivity.
Moreover, we demonstrated robust detection of IL-6 and IL-1β
in spiked undiluted equine synovial fluid with small variation compared
to buffer controls. In addition, the availability of real time measurements
provides extensive quality control opportunities, essential for clinical
applications. Therefore, we consider this method is suitable for broad
application in SPRi for multiplex biomarker detection in both research
and clinical settings.

==== Body
The complexity
and multifactorial
nature of chronic diseases requires the measurement of multiple biomarkers
to provide robust information for both diagnosis and prognosis.1 For this reason, there is a large interest in
developing reliable biomarker detection systems suitable for clinical
use. These systems should preferably combine high sensitivity, wide
dynamic detection range, and multiplexing capacity in complex fluids
with robust quality control opportunities. To our knowledge, considering
the challenging demands, presently no system adequately meets these
requirements.

Traditionally, biomarker measurements are performed
using the ELISA
format in both research and clinical settings. Although its benefits
are clinically proven, the ELISA assay comes with a number of disadvantages:
it requires relatively large sample volumes, has a small dynamic detection
range necessitating the use of a dilution series, and has only limited
multiplexing capabilities. Furthermore, the need for expensive kits
and bulky automation limits its usefulness for point-of-care applications.2 Therefore, many alternative biomarker assays
have been developed.3 These can be separated
into 2D planar assays and bead suspension assays. The 2D planar assays,
such as Mesoscale Discovery and Searchlight, use a similar approach
to the standard ELISA, with variation in the detection method (electro-chemiluminescent,
chemiluminescent, fluorescent, or colorimetric). They apply a microarray
format, allowing for multiplex measurements in small sample volumes.
Despite the frequent use and the improvement over standard ELISAs,
reports show a high interassay variability,4,5 unreliability,4,6,7 and lack of quality control opportunities.5,7 Bead suspension assays are also often used for multiplex applications,
especially in research settings. Of these, flow cytometry bead arrays
and Luminex are the most common. These assays show excellent sensitivity
over an acceptable dynamic detection range;8 however, reports show a high interassay CV at low concentrations,
resulting in unreliable results.9 Also,
the inherent increase in nonspecific interactions in suspension places
a restraint on the multiplexing capacity.10

To overcome these limitations, new platforms are being developed
that combine advanced surface chemistry and nanotechnology to create
sophisticated sensing platforms.11 In the
literature, many elegant approaches are proposed that provide exceptional
sensitivity,12 an acceptable dynamic detection
range,13 and good multiplexing potential.14,15 However, most of the aforementioned approaches are complex and are
often end-point measurements. Due to the inherent variability in sensors
and their “black box” nature, this leaves a large challenge
for adequate and real-time quality control in clinical applications
unaddressed.16

Surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) is widely used in biomolecular
interaction research applications for its sensitivity and real-time
measurements. This technique evolved with SPR imaging (SPRi) to allow
for simultaneous multiplex detection. More recently, its potential
for biomarker detection has been explored. However, due to the small
refractive index changes following interaction between a ligand and
analyte, the signal-to-noise ratio is inadequate at low concentrations.
Therefore, many attempts have been made to improve the sensitivity
of measuring biomarkers. Natan’s group was the first to show
improved sensitivity using nanoparticle tags.17 Following this, several approaches using various nanoparticles were
explored for their suitability in taking low concentration measurements,18,19 and more recently, the chemical conjugation of these nanoparticles
was optimized.20 However, little work has
focused on the detection of biomarkers at high sensitivity and over
a wide dynamic detection range in a multiplex setting. More particularly,
ease of use and applicability in a future clinical setting is not
often considered.

In this paper, we propose a method to improve
both the sensitivity
and the dynamic detection range in a multiplex setting with SPRi.
We apply an antibody sandwich cascade using the biotin–neutravidin
system in combination with commercially available biotinylated gold
nanoparticles to sequentially increase the signal (schematically shown
in Figure 1). We present
a feasibility study both in clean buffers and in spiked equine synovial
fluid with four cytokines, IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α.
These cytokines are implicated in many diseases and can provide information
on diagnosis and prognosis. However, they are present in pg/mL (low
fM) in bodily fluids, therefore requiring high sensitivity. In addition,
they can vary dramatically in concentration between disease states,
requiring a large dynamic detection range.21 We show that our method leads to a large improvement of both the
sensitivity and the dynamic detection range and provides extensive
quality control opportunities. Therefore, we feel that this approach
is an important step forward for the broader application of the SPRi
technique for multiplex biomarker detection. This can eventually lead
to exciting applications in both research and clinical settings.

Figure 1 SPRi signal
enhancement cascade using biotinylated gold nanoparticles.
In this cascade, there is a sequential buildup of the complex and
thus in SPRi signal. Initially, a specific capture antibody (1) interacts
with the antigen (2); this is followed by a specific detection antibody
toward that antigen in a sandwich format (3). Subsequently, neutravidin
binds to the complex (4) followed by a commercially available biotinylated
gold nanoparticle for large signal improvement (5).

Experimental Section
Chemicals, Immunological
Reagents, and Equipment
Acetic
acid, sodium acetate, phosphorous acid, phosphate buffered saline,
magnesium chloride, Tween 20, Tween 80, and bovine serum albumin (BSA)
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands). The
capture antibodies (cAb) and biotinylated detection antibodies (dAb)
for IL-6 (cAb clone MQ2-13A5, dAb clone MQ2-39C3), IL-1β (cAb
clone JK1B1, dAb clone JK1B2), and TNF-α (cAb clone Mab1, dAb
clone Mab11), as well as the recombinant proteins IL-6, IL-1β,
TNF-α, and IFN-γ were purchased from Biolegend (San Diego,
USA). The capture antibodies and biotinylated detection antibodies
for IFN-γ (cAb clone A35, dAb clone B27) were obtained from
Mybiosource (San Diego, USA). Neutravidin was obtained from Thermo
Fisher (Waltham, USA). 40 nm biotinylated gold nanoparticles were
purchased from Cytodiagnostics (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Preactivated
sensors for amine coupling (G-type easy2spot) were purchased from
Ssens bv (Hengelo, The Netherlands).

Sensor Preparation
Antibodies were immobilized on G-type
easy2spot sensors via reaction to free amines using the Wasatch microfluidics
continuous flow spotter (Wasatch Microfluidics, Salt Lake City, UT,
US) for 30 min. Gel-type sensors were used for their increased binding
capacity and more efficient use of the evanescent field, compared
to a planar surface sensor. The immobilization reaction was performed
in 50 mM acetic acid buffer (150 μL per spot) with antibody
concentrations specified in the respective experiments. An immobilization
buffer of pH 4.6 provided antibody coupling with the highest retained
activity and was therefore used for all experiments. At this pH, the
antibodies are concentrated to the negatively charged hydrogel. Additionally,
the low pH reduces the reactivity of lysines, leading to more directed
coupling to primary amines. To reduce nonspecific interactions, the
sensor was deactivated by 1% BSA in 50 mM acetate buffer at pH 4.6
for 7 min and subsequently with 0.2 M ethanolamine at pH 8.5 for an
additional 7 min.

SPRi Measurements
The IBIS MX96
(IBIS Technologies,
Enschede, The Netherlands) was used for the SPRi measurements. It
applies an angle-scanning method with automatic fitting to determine
SPR shifts. It has an automatic fluid-handling system and utilizes
back-and-forth flow through a microfluidic flow cell that fits the
array to enable minimal sample use. It is capable of measuring 96
spots simultaneously and is therefore highly suitable for our desired
multiplex measurements. Measurements were programmed using SUIT software
(IBIS Technologies, Enschede, The Netherlands). In this program, the
type of interaction, interaction times, samples, and regions of interest
(ROIs) for the antibodies were set. Subsequently, a template was created
and loaded into the IBIS data acquisition software. Before each experiment,
an angle offset was applied to ensure a wide dynamic detection range.
After programming, the machine provides automatic liquid handling
and SPR angle measurements. For each experiment, 48 sensor spots were
used. Back-and-forth flow was set to 10 μL/min in a flow cell
containing 12 μL of sample. Sprint software was used for data
collection and referencing. Data was subsequently exported to Matlab
R2015a for further analysis and quality control through the use of
custom scripts (available upon request).

Antibody Affinity Measurements
The affinity between
the capture antibodies and cytokines was characterized by applying
the kinetic titration method proposed by Schasfoort et al.22 to avoid possible reduction in binding capacity
under regeneration conditions. Sensors were prepared as explained
above. Antibodies were spotted at 5, 2.5, 1.25, and 0.625 μg/mL
at eight spots per concentration leading to average RU of 2000 ±
250, 1500 ± 225, 900 ± 250, and 300 ± 50, respectively.
Cytokines were dissolved in system buffer, containing PBS with 0.075%
Tween 80, at a concentration of (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 nM).

The kinetic titration was performed as follows: first, two blanks
were injected followed by the respective cytokine at 1 nM and successive
injections of two times increased concentrations up to 64 nM. The
association time of each interaction was 10 min followed by a 12 min
dissociation. Between each injection, the sensor was washed with system
buffer.

Scrubber2 software was used to analyze the affinity
data as described
previously.22 The blanks were subtracted,
and the signal was zeroed to the first interaction. To determine the
affinity of a specific spot, first the koff rate was determined in the dissociation phase. Subsequently, the kon rate was determined using a fixed koff and a floating start point, to compensate
for the titration setup. The affinity was determined for the antibodies
at four spot densities leading to binding capacities (Rmax) and an affinity curve of KD to Rmax. The reported affinity for each
antibody was calculated by extrapolating Rmax to 100 (capture antibody affinities can be found in Figures S1–S4).

SPRi Enhancement Cascade
A SPRi signal enhancement
cascade measurement was performed with the cytokines IL-6, IL-1β,
TNF-α, and IFN-γ in a broad dynamic detection range. Cytokine
specific sensors were prepared as explained above. Antibodies were
spotted at 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.3125, and 0.15625 μg/mL with
eight spots per concentration. Samples were dissolved in system buffer,
containing PBS with 0.075% Tween 80 and 0.5% BSA. Cytokines were measured
at a concentration ranging from 100 fg/mL (∼5 fM) to 1 μg/mL
(∼50 nM), spanning a dynamic detection range of 7 logarithms.
A baseline of 5 min and an association time of 120 min were used.
The detection antibody concentration was optimized for each cytokine,
leading to 2.5 μg/mL (16.5 nM) for IL-6, 5 μg/mL (33 nM)
for IL-1β and TNF-α, and 10 μg/mL (66 nM) for IFN-γ,
respectively. Interaction with the detection antibody was performed
with a baseline of 2 and 30 min association times. Neutravidin was
used at a concentration of 1.5 μg/mL (25 nM), 2 min baseline,
and 15 min association (optimization shown in Figures S5 and S6), and the gold nanoparticle concentration
was 77.69 mg/mL (0.2 nM), 2 min baseline, and 15 min association (optimization
shown in Figure S7). After each cascade,
the sensor was regenerated using a double regeneration pulse for 30s.
Optimal regeneration conditions were antibody dependent and were determined
according to the protocol adapted from Anderson et al.23 The first regeneration pulse consisted of 200
mM phosphoric acid at pH 2.5, which was sufficient to remove IL-1β,
TNF-α, and IFN-γ. The second pulse consisted of 66 mM
phosphoric acid, 333 mM MgCl2 and 6.66 mM EDTA, and was
required to regenerate IL-6 binding antibodies. Reproducibility of
interaction after multiple regenerations is demonstrated in Figure S8.

The cascade interaction was
performed as follows: First, a cytokine was injected, followed by
a specific biotinylated detection antibody, neutravidin, and a biotinylated
gold nanoparticle (40 nm diameter, which has optimal absorption vs
scattering properties24). After each interaction,
the sensor was washed to reduce the nonspecific signal. Each step
in the cascade will increase the interaction signal proportionally
and thus the sensitivity of the assay.

A typical experiment
started with two full cascades with system
buffer in each step to remove unbound antibody and to create a stable
baseline. Subsequently, three blank cascades were measured, with system
buffer in the cytokine interaction step, followed by the biotinylated
detection antibody, neutravidin, and the biotinylated gold nanoparticle.
These blanks were used to determine nonspecific interactions and provide
the background correction. Finally, the cytokine cascades were performed
starting from the lowest concentration.

Data was collected using
Sprint software, referenced, and exported
to Matlab. A custom Matlab script (available upon request) was used
to determine the Rmax of each antibody
spot, by 1–1 Langmuir fitting to at least three cytokine concentrations.
Signals were extra- or interpolated to Rmax 100 to correct for spotting irregularities. Subsequently, the signal
from eight antibody spots of similar spotting density was combined
to average the noise and to increase the robustness of signal. The
limit of blank (LoB) and lower limit of detection (LLoD) were calculated
as described by Armbruster and Pry25 using
the following equations: LoB = meanblank + 1.645 (SDblank) and LLoD = LoB + 1.645 (SDlow concentration sample). The dynamic detection range was then calculated as the log10 of the upper limit of detection (ULoD) divided by the LLoD.

Multiplex Cytokine Measurement
In the multiplex experiments,
sensors with antibodies for IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ
were spotted at a concentration of 5 μg/mL with 10 spots per
cytokine. As a control, 5 μg/mL BSA was immobilized on eight
spots. Samples were dissolved in system buffer, containing PBS with
0.075% Tween 80 and 0.5% BSA. Five mixtures of cytokines were measured.
The first mixture contained the cytokines at a concentration in the
lower region of the dynamic detection range determined previously.
The concentrations chosen were 10, 33, 333, and 333 pg/mL for IL-6,
IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, respectively. In mixtures
2 to 5, the concentration of a single cytokine was increased to a
level higher in its dynamic detection range, while the other remained
at the concentration of mixture 1. This leads to 333 pg/mL for IL-6
(mixture 2) and 1 ng/mL for IL-1β (mixture 3), TNF-α (mixture
4), and IFN-γ (mixture 5). The detection antibodies were used
in a mix in their optimal concentrations (2.5 μg/mL (16.5 nM)
for IL-6, 5 μg/mL (33 nM) for IL-1β and TNF-α, and
10 μg/mL (66 nM) for IFN-γ, respectively). Neutravidin
was used at a concentration of 1.5 μg/mL (25 nM), and the gold
nanoparticle concentration was 77.69 mg/mL (0.2 nM).

The multiplex
experiment was performed as follows. Two cascades with system buffer
were performed in each step to remove unbound antibody and to create
a stable baseline. Next, three blank cascades were measured with system
buffer in the cytokine interaction step, followed by the biotinylated
detection antibody mix, neutravidin, and the biotinylated gold nanoparticle.
These blanks were used to determine nonspecific interactions and provide
the background correction. Finally, the cytokine mixtures were measured
starting from 1 to 5. At the end of the measurement, a calibration
with 2% glycerol was performed.

In addition, we performed an
experiment to determine the specificity
of the capture and the detection antibodies. In this experiment, we
used the same sensor as described in the standard multiplex experiment.
Instead of mixtures, we injected single cytokines at 100 ng/mL with
an association time of 120 min, followed by detection antibodies for
30 min. The detection antibodies were used in a mix in their optimal
concentrations (2.5 μg/mL (16.5 nM) for IL-6, 5 μg/mL
(33 nM) for IL-1β and TNF-α, and 10 μg/mL (66 nM)
for IFN-γ, respectively). Neutravidin was used at a concentration
of 1.5 μg/mL (25 nM), and the gold nanoparticle concentration
was 77.69 mg/mL (0.2 nM).

Cytokine Measurement in Spiked Synovial Fluid
To determine
the feasibility of our approach with complex fluids, a spiking experiment
was performed using equine synovial fluid. Sensors were prepared as
explained above. A system buffer, containing 1 M NaCl, 2% Tween 20,
and 0.5% BSA (adapted from ref (19)), was used to reduce nonspecific binding. The detection
antibody mix, containing optimal concentrations, neutravidin, and
the gold nanoparticles were dissolved in this buffer. Cytokines were
measured at a concentration at the higher end of their dynamic detection
range, namely, 333 pg/mL for IL-6 and 1 ng/mL for IL-1β, respectively.
They were dissolved in pure synovial fluid, half system buffer and
half synovial fluid, or only system buffer as control.

The spiking
experiment was performed as follows. Two cascades with system buffer
in each step were performed to remove unbound antibody and to create
a stable baseline. Subsequently, two blank cascades were measured
with system buffer in the cytokine interaction step, followed by the
biotinylated detection antibody mix, neutravidin, and the biotinylated
gold nanoparticle. These blanks were used to determine nonspecific
interactions and provide the background correction. Then, alternating
a blank and a spike in buffer, half synovial fluid or synovial fluid
was measured. At the end of the measurement, a calibration with 2%
glycerol was performed.

Results and Discussion
SPRi Enhancement Cascade
The signal enhancement of
the SPRi measurement of cytokines using our sequential cascade is
shown in Figure 2.
Here, the response over time is shown after interaction with IL-6
at 10 ng/mL (∼500 pM).

Figure 2 SPRi enhancement cascade response over time.
The interaction with
IL-6 is shown, followed by specific detection antibody, neutravidin,
and gold nanoparticle. The graph (A) shows the average signal, in
refractive index units (RU), combined from eight unique antibody spots
with a uniform spotting density, corrected as described to Rmax = 100 RU. The subplots (B–E) show
the individual autoscaled graphs for each step in the signal enhancement
cascade.

The graph shows association with
IL-6 leads to a small signal of
20 RU. After the subsequent addition of biotinylated IL-6 antibody,
this signal increases to 60 RU within 30 min. Association with neutravidin
increases the signal further to 180 RU in 15 min. Finally, the biotinylated
gold nanoparticle dramatically increases the signal to approximately
3000 RU. In combination, the three consecutive enhancement steps lead
to a signal increase of 3, 9, and 150 times, respectively, compared
to the IL-6 signal alone. Moreover, the use of a detection antibody
increases not only the sensitivity but also the specificity for the
respective cytokine leading to increased reliability of the measurement.

Dynamic Detection Range Measurements
The signal enhancement
cascade was used to measure the cytokines IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α,
and IFN-γ over a broad concentration range from 100 fg/mL (∼5
fM) up to 1 μg/mL (∼50 nM) spanning a dynamic detection
range of 7 logs. The resulting signal increase after each step in
the enhancement cascade is shown in log–log plots in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Enhancement cascade leads
to sequential improvement in sensitivity
and dynamic detection range. (A) The signal increase (dRU) after association
with analyte, detection antibody (Det. Ab), neutravidin (NeuAv), and
gold nanoparticle (GNP) is shown for IL-6 over a concentration range
from 100 fg/mL to 100 ng/mL (1 μg/mL is omitted due to clipping
of too high signal). The inset shows the linear signal increase between
0.1 and 100 pg/mL (R2 = 0.98); data for
other cytokines are shown in Figure S9.
The signals represent the average of eight spots, corrected to Rmax = 100 RU. Error bars depict standard deviations.
Four-parameter logistic regression was used to fit the data points.
(B–D) The signal after gold nanoparticle enhancement for IL-1β,
IFN-γ, and TNF-α over a concentration range from 100 fg/mL
to 1 μg/mL.

Figure 3A shows
the signal increase after each enhancement step using IL-6 as the
analyte. The lower limit of detection improves from 2 ng/mL after
analyte association to 300 pg/mL after detection antibody, to 20 pg/mL
after neutravidin, and finally to 50 fg/mL after the gold nanoparticle
enhancement. This leads to an improvement in the limit of detection
of 40 000 times. Additionally, the dynamic detection range
increases from 3 logs to at least 7 logs. Moreover, the intra-assay
precision is high (see Table S5 for more
details), especially in the linear range (CV < 10%) but also at
low concentrations (CV < 20%). This allows for excellent concentration
measurements, especially in the challenging lower portion of the dynamic
detection range. We subsequently determined interassay precision (Table S6). This resulted in good precision at
higher concentrations after analyte and antibody interaction and at
lower concentration after neutravidin and gold nanoparticle interaction
(CVs 2–20%). Thus, depending on the analyte concentration,
one can select the best step in the amplification cascade for concentration
measurement.

Figure 3B–D
shows the signal increase over the dynamic detection range for IL-1β,
IFN-γ, and TNF-α after the gold nanoparticle signal enhancement.
A similar increase in signal in each enhancement step was achieved
as depicted with IL-6 (data shown over a range of spot densities in Figure S10). The figures show a good logistic
regression fit and a broad dynamic detection range for the measured
cytokines. Figure 4 shows a plot for the limit of detection versus the capture antibody
affinity.

Figure 4 Lower limit of detection is plotted against the affinity of the
capture antibody for the four cytokines measured. The figure shows
good correlation between the capture antibody affinity and the LLOD
in a power law function (R2 = 0.98). This
indicates that the capture antibody affinity is the main predictor
for the sensitivity of the assay. Variations in detection antibody
affinity and biotin availability for neutravidin potentially play
a less pronounced role.

The data shows the detection limit and dynamic detection
range
are dependent on the individual cytokine and, thus, on the antibody
pair used in the sandwich assay (more details in Table S7). This is shown by an increasing LOD of 1.2, 15,
and 22 pg/mL for IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, respectively,
compared to IL-6 and a decreasing dynamic detection range of 5 logs.
This follows the trend in the affinity of the capture antibodies with
a KD of 43 pM for IL-6, 1.5 nM for IL-1β, 7.8 nM for TNF-α,
and 26.3 nM for IFN-γ, respectively (affinity measurements are
shown in Figures S1–S4). Although
the affinities of the detection antibodies were not measured, the
figure shows the capture antibody affinity is a good predictor for
the sensitivity (R2 = 0.98, Figure 4).

Multiplex Cytokine Measurement
The cytokines were measured
in mixtures of both low and high concentrations to show the multiplexing
potential of the enhancement cascade. The results are shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Cytokines were measured
specifically in multiplex. (A) The RU signal
during gold nanoparticle association after interaction with a mixture
of cytokines in the lower region of the dynamic detection range, followed
by the detection antibody and neutravidin cascade. The graph shows
the baseline, followed by 15 min of association and 10 min of dissociation.
The signals shown are an average of 10 spots. (B–E) Similar
measurements as in (A) were performed; however, the concentration
of a single cytokine is increased to the higher region in their dynamic
detection range, without changing other concentrations in the mixture.
In this way, the specificity and cross-reactivity of the cytokine
detection was assessed.

Figure 5A
shows
the signal during the injection of the biotinylated gold nanoparticle
as the last step in the signal enhancement cascade after incubation
with a mixture of cytokines in the lower part of their respective
dynamic detection range. The signals in the detection antibody and
neutravidin steps were similar to those measured in earlier singleplex
experiments at these concentrations, indicating specific interactions
(data not shown). In Figure 5B–E, the concentration of one of the cytokines was
increased by 3 times for IL-6 and IL-1β or 30 times for TNF-α
and IFN-γ, depending on the size of the dynamic detection range.
As shown in Figure 5B–E, increasing the concentrations of individual cytokines
leads to no (in the case of IL-6), minor (in the case of IL-1β
and TNF-α), or moderate (in the case of IFN-γ) nonspecific
signal and to a large specific signal increase (further clarified
in Figure S11). In Figure S12, the specificity is further assessed with injections
of single cytokines and detection antibodies. Here, we show there
is very limited nonspecificity with both analyte and detection antibody.
This indicates that the signal amplification method is suitable for
multiplex measurements.

Cytokine Measurement in Spiked Synovial Fluid
For clinical
biomarker assays, reliable measurements in complex fluids are essential.
These complex fluids can range from serum to urine to synovial fluid,
of which synovial fluid is considered the most challenging due to
its high viscosity, particle contaminants, and limitations of small
volumes. Here, we demonstrate a spike and recovery experiment of IL-6
and IL-1β in equine synovial fluid. The cytokines were spiked
in synovial fluid, in synovial fluid diluted with buffer, or in pure
buffer. In Figure 6, we show the results after gold nanoparticle association for IL-6
and IL-1β.

Figure 6 Spikes in synovial fluid can be measured with only minor
variation
compared to buffer controls. (A) The graph shows RU signal after interaction
with a mixture of cytokines in the higher region of the dynamic detection
range, followed by the detection antibody, neutravidin, and gold nanoparticle
cascade. The cytokines were spiked in synovial fluid, in half synovial
fluid and half buffer, or in pure buffer. The signals shown represent
the average of 10 measurement spots. (B–E) Subplots are shown
for each step in the enhancement cascade. The graphs show the baseline,
followed by association and dissociation.

Figure 6 shows
that
direct measurements of cytokines in synovial fluid are impossible
due to the large RU shifts caused by refractive index inhomogeneities
in the synovial fluid. After incubation with synovial fluid, the sensor
is washed and all subsequent measurement steps are performed in clean
buffers resulting in stable baseline RUs allowing for reliable measurements
(background signal shown in Figure S13).
Consequently, after the enhancement cascade, both IL-6 and IL-1β
can be measured in spiked diluted synovial fluid with no to very small
variation compared to buffer controls (recovery of 98% and 89% for
IL-6 and IL-1β, respectively). Considering the challenging nature
of synovial fluid, this is excellent accuracy. In pure synovial fluid,
the signal decreases to roughly half that of buffer controls but can
still be readily measured with precision (recovery of 53% and 67%
for IL-6 and IL-1β, respectively). The lower recovery in pure
synovial fluid may be accounted for by its electrolyte composition
which may influence the binding equilibrium. Together, this indicates
that, while refractive index inhomogeneities in synovial fluid have
an effect on the cytokine measurements, this effect is minimal in
the enhancement cascade and can be easily corrected.

Biomarker
detection systems for chronic diseases in both research
and clinical settings require high sensitivity, wide dynamic detection
range, and multiplexing capability in complex fluids with robust quality
control opportunities. A system combining these demanding requirements
does not yet exist.

In this study, we have implemented an enhancement
cascade for SPRi
that shows significant improvement in signal with only minor nonspecific
background interactions. We have shown that the combination of the
large signal increase with the reduction in standard deviation, through
correction for ligand density variation, leads to very high sensitivity
and a LLoD as low as 50 fg/mL (2 fM), depending on the capture antibody.
Additionally, as the upper limit of detection is not reduced in the
enhancement cascade, we obtained an extremely high dynamic detection
range of 7 logarithms for quantitative measurements. This is comparable
to, if not more sensitive than, the most sensitive commercial planar
(Mesoscale discovery: average LLoD = 500 fg/mL, dynamic detection
range = 3.5 logs) and bead suspension (Luminex: average LLoD = 2 pg/mL,
dynamic detection range = 4 logs) assays available today.26 When comparing our method to other experimental
assays, we demonstrate similar (low fg/mL15,18) or better (low pg/mL13,19) sensitivity. Yet,
our dynamic detection range is much wider than most reported, which
is often no more than 3–4 logs.13,15,19 This wide dynamic detection range is highly relevant
considering the large difference between base level concentrations
of different biomarkers and the large variation in individual biomarker
concentrations between the healthy population and sick individuals
but also between individual patients. Additionally, the large dynamic
detection range can avoid the need for a dilution series. The sensitivity
we have achieved is essential in the measurement of biomarkers, in
particularly for cytokines. The concentration of IL-6, TNF-α,
and IFN-γ is in the low pg/mL range in healthy subjects and
will often not increase above 100 pg/mL in patients.27,28 This already poses a large challenge in clinical diagnostics for
these markers with nondetectable values in a substantial subset of
patients. For example, IL-1β is a highly interesting potent
marker, associated with many inflammatory diseases, and could have
diagnostic potential. However, its concentration in serum never exceeds
10 pg/mL, even in patients,29 and can therefore
not be reliably measured with most current clinical tools. The high
sensitivity of our method does allow for measuring these challenging
biomarkers, opening new opportunities for clinical diagnostics.

We have demonstrated the multiplexing potential of our method by
specifically measuring the cytokines in mixtures compared to single
controls. We show there is only minor cross-reactivity, especially
with IL-6 and IL-1β. Moderate but larger cross reactivity was
shown with TNF-α and IFN-γ. Furthermore, we have demonstrated
the potential of our method to measure biomarkers in complex fluids
simultaneously in multiplex. To achieve this, we have used a single
sensor to measure IL-6 and IL-1β spiked in equine synovial fluid,
either pure or diluted with buffer. We have shown that only minor
signal variations occur in half diluted synovial fluid compared to
buffer controls. Considering the highly viscous nature of the synovial
fluid with major impurities and the large nonspecific signal during
the cytokine association phase, this represents remarkable accuracy.
Association in pure synovial fluid leads to a small signal reduction
of roughly half compared to that achieved in buffer controls. This
reduction can potentially be attributed to the salt concentration,
pH, and viscosity of the synovial fluid which can exert a specific
effect on the antibodies and their binding characteristics. While
this reduction might slightly decrease the sensitivity, it is probable
that a small dilution in concentrated buffer can help diminish these
effects. Therefore, we are confident that our method can be applied
to measure simultaneously various cytokines sensitively and specifically
in complex fluids.

The availability of real time measurements
allows us to measure
the signal at any given moment in the cascade. This provides extensive
quality control opportunities, essential for clinical applications.
For example, the evaluation of binding curves can provide more quantitative
data and help detect and eliminate nonspecific signals. In addition,
it can provide actual binding capacities of spots allowing for a correction
for spotting irregularities, which we have applied. As a result, we
have achieved small intra-assay CVs with eight individual spots of
no more than 10% in the linear range and less than 20% at the lowest
concentrations, leading to excellent reproducibility. These are major
advantages compared to standard assays, which show problems with spotting
irregularities, assay reproducibility,30 and large CVs in the low concentration range,31 making them unsuitable for large scale clinical implementation.7

Our enhancement cascade leads to excellent
sensitivity and a dynamic
detection range and works in multiplex, and we have shown feasibility
for measuring in complex fluids. However, although our method works
reliably for all cytokines tested, there is a large influence of the
quality of the antibody pair on the outcome of the assay. For example,
when comparing our best antibody pair (IL-6) to our worst (IFN-γ),
the LLoD worsens from 50 fg/mL to 22 pg/mL, leading to an almost 1000
times lower sensitivity. In fact, we showed that there is a strong
direct correlation between the affinity of the capture antibody and
the sensitivity. Furthermore, we have shown larger nonspecific interactions
in multiplex with our weakest antibody pairs. It is striking that
the antibodies with the lowest affinity, highest limit of detection,
and smallest dynamic detection range also show the highest cross-reactivity.
This importance of the capture antibody is well-known and received
extra attention due to the reproducibility crisis32 but is still not often considered in detail. It is notoriously
difficult to find high affinity antibody pairs33 without ranking various antibodies from different suppliers,
and specific information on antibody affinity is not known or is not
given by suppliers.34

The SPRi technology
specifically is well positioned to determine
the antibody quality considering its long history in assessing molecular
interactions. Therefore, this technique should be used to select good
antibody pairs with high affinity and low cross-reactivity for clinical
assay development. Considering our antibody panel, it becomes apparent
that only the antibodies for IL-6 and IL-1β are suitable for
clinical application. For the other cytokines, higher affinity antibody
pairs should be found.

While the SPRi technology is highly suitable
for multiplex measurements
in small volumes and provides excellent quality control, it also has
some limitations which are important to consider for large scale use.
Signal fluctuations that occur with this technology require user experience
and advanced software to deal with appropriately. In addition, the
technology is still costly, with machines costing over 100k. This
limits the availability of the technology. Smaller point of care devices
that are under development could potentially address this issue.

We have demonstrated the feasibility of our enhancement cascade
to measure biomarkers in multiplex in complex fluids. However, for
clinical application, it is desired to further validate our method
in human or equine samples. It is recommended to measure recovery
and precision of spikes and potential interferences and to perform
comparative measurements with standard methods in the field. This
will be part of future work in which we will apply our method to measure
cytokines in equine and human cohorts.

Conclusion
In
this paper, we present the development of an enhancement cascade
for SPRi based on a sandwich assay and nanoparticle amplification.
This method not only can measure at high sensitivity and over a large
dynamic detection range but also achieves this in multiplex, requiring
small volumes, and still is very accurate even in synovial fluid,
one of the most demanding complex bodily fluids. In addition, our
method shows good reproducibility and allows for extensive quality
control, essential for clinical application. In future work, we will
further validate our method in equine and human patient cohorts to
allow for both research and clinical diagnostic applications.
