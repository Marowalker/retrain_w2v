Polymeric
nanoparticles have become indispensable in modern society
with a wide array of applications ranging from waterborne coatings
to drug-carrier-delivery systems. While a large range of techniques
exist to determine a multitude of properties of these particles, relating
physicochemical properties of the particle to the chemical structure
of the intrinsic polymers is still challenging. A novel, highly orthogonal
separation system based on comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography
(LC × LC) has been developed. The system combines hydrodynamic
chromatography (HDC) in the first-dimension to separate the particles
based on their size, with ultrahigh-performance size-exclusion chromatography
(SEC) in the second dimension to separate the constituting polymer
molecules according to their hydrodynamic radius for each of 80 to
100 separated fractions. A chip-based mixer is incorporated to transform
the sample by dissolving the separated nanoparticles from the first-dimension
online in tetrahydrofuran. The polymer bands are then focused using
stationary-phase-assisted modulation to enhance sensitivity, and the
water from the first-dimension eluent is largely eliminated to allow
interaction-free SEC. Using the developed system, the combined two-dimensional
distribution of the particle-size and the molecular-size of a mixture
of various polystyrene (PS) and polyacrylate (PACR) nanoparticles
has been obtained within 60 min.

Polymeric
nanoparticles have
become indispensable in modern society with applications ranging from
electronics,1 pharmaceuticals,2 and templates for porous materials,3,4 to coatings5,6 and inks.7,8 There
are various techniques for the preparation of these polymeric systems,
including emulsion polymerization and nanoprecipitation. Emulsion
polymerization involves the emulsification of relatively hydrophobic
monomers in water by an emulsifier (e.g., a surfactant). Upon addition
of a similarly hydrophobic initiator, the polymerization process yields
stabilized, dispersed polymeric particles.9 In nanoprecipitation, preformed polymers are dissolved in a solvent
(e.g., acetone). The solution is injected into a nonsolvent, typically
an aqueous solution containing a stabilizing surfactant, to yield
a suspension of particles.10,11 These and other preparation
techniques provide a number of means to influence the various colloidal
and physicochemical properties. They have been thoroughly reviewed
by Rao and Geckeler.12

A wide array
of analysis techniques exists to characterize nanoparticles
based on their size. Notable examples are asymmetrical field field-flow
fractionation (AF4), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), hydrodynamic
chromatography (HDC), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). These techniques
and their hyphenation with spectroscopic techniques have been compared
and evaluated in a detailed review by Lespes and Gigault.13 Similarly, various analysis methods can be used
to characterize the polymers and small molecules (e.g., for drug-delivery
applications) which compose these nanoparticles. Typical examples
are size-exclusion chromatography (SEC),14 field-flow fractionation (FFF),15 capillary
electrophoresis (CE),16 and matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS).17

All of these techniques have proven to
provide highly useful data
to study relevant properties of the sample of interest. It is no surprise
that multiple detection techniques have been used in parallel or in
series (i.e., online) to determine and relate different properties
of nanoparticles simultaneously.18−21 However, contemporary nanoparticle
analysis is typically limited to physicochemical properties at the
particle level. In cases where compositional information is sought,
spectroscopic methods yield exclusively average numbers on the elemental
(e.g., by inductively coupled plasma–atomic-emission spectroscopy,
ICP-AES) or structural (e.g., by FTIR) composition of the particle
as a whole. Alternatively, dissolution of the nanoparticles and subsequent
separation may yield compositional information yet forfeits information
on the nanoparticle-size distribution.

Particle-size separation
by HDC or FFF with subsequent fraction
collection potentially provides both types of information but is labor-
and time-intensive if multiple fractions are to be collected. Moreover,
off-line coupling suffers from the common drawback that the yield
(i.e., the mass of sample) per fraction is rather limited.

Another
technique for the multidimensional characterization of
complex mixtures is comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography
(LC × LC).22 In LC × LC, two
substantially different (orthogonal) separation mechanisms are coupled
online through a modulator. Typically, the modulator comprises a two-position
switching valve equipped with two loops, which alternatingly connect
to the first-dimension to fractionate the effluent or to the second
dimension to inject the collected fraction. The rate at which the
valve switches is determined by what is commonly referred to as the
modulation time. For comprehensive 2D-LC, the premise is that the
entire first-dimension effluent is subjected to a second-dimension
separation, thus inducing the need for the second-dimension separation
to be finished before the valve switches again (i.e., the modulation
time equals the maximum second-dimension analysis time).

LC
× LC has not been applied to nanoparticles for several
good reasons. HDC and AF4 provide a very similar, size-based
selectivity. No other LC mechanism is expected to provide any meaningful
information on the intact particles, since these are typically too
large to enter the pores fully (to allow sufficient enthalpic interaction)
or partly (to allow size-exclusion chromatography). Thus, the particles
need to be dissolved to allow characterization by LC. The only possible
way of characterizing nanoparticles with LC × LC appears to perform
HDC in the first dimension, and then dissolve the particles, and use
one of several LC techniques (SEC, gradient-elution LC, etc.) in the
second dimension to characterize the constituting polymers. Dissolution
of the particles requires the addition of a strong organic solvent
to the aqueous dispersion. However, it is likely that either the organic
solvent or the remaining aqueous fraction pose detrimental effects
on the second-dimension separation due to solvent incompatibility
problems and excessive dilution. For example, the large amount of
organic solvent required for dissolution increases the risk of breakthrough
phenomena in RPLC,23 whereas the remaining
water potentially engenders interaction in SEC.24 Fortunately, these effects can be minimized using efficient
mixing and small injection volumes in the second dimension. The latter
requires either very low flow rates in the first dimension or short
modulation times in the second dimension, which in turn translates
into very fast second-dimension separations. We have recently demonstrated
ultrafast SEC separations using core–shell stationary phases25 which satisfies this premise.

One research
interest of our group is to develop methods for the
comprehensive characterization of nanoparticles to obtain complete
information on mutually dependent particle-size and molecular distributions.
Examples of the latter are molecular-weight distribution, chemical-composition
distribution, functionality-type distribution, etc. To measure accurate
molecular distributions we must address challenges, such as breakthrough
or undesired interactions.

In this work, we demonstrate the
comprehensive analysis of polystyrene
(PS) and polyacrylate (PACR) nanoparticles by HDC × SEC, using
online dissolution of the nanoparticles into the composite polymers
and stationary-phase-assisted modulation. We will first address the
development of the individual one-dimensional separation mechanisms
before addressing the feasibility of coupling the two dimensions together
with intermediate dissolution. Factors determining successful transfer
and dissolution (i.e., mixing, solvent ratios, etc.) with minimal
detrimental effects are addressed.

Experimental Section
Instrumentation
The experiments in this study were
all carried out on an Agilent 1290 Infinity 2D-LC system (Agilent,
Waldbronn, Germany). The system encompassed two binary pumps (model
G4220A), one 1200 isocratic pump (model G1310A), an autosampler (model
G4226A), two thermostated column compartments (model G1316C) each
equipped with a 2D-LC 8-port 2-position modulation valve (model G4236A),
and two diode-array detectors (model G4212A) outfitted with Agilent
Max-Light cartridge cells (model G4212-6008, 10 mm, Vdet = 1.0 μL). The autosampler injector needle was
set to draw and eject at a speed of 10 μL/min with two seconds
equilibration time. All tubing connections were made from stainless
steel. The entire system was controlled using Agilent OpenLAB CDS
Chemstation Edition (Rev. C.01.04) software.

The first-dimension
column was an Agilent PL–PSDA cartridge type-2 (800 ×
7.5 mm i.d.). The second-dimension column combination comprised three
Phenomenex (Torrance, CA) experimental core–shell (150 ×
4.6 mm i.d., 3.6-μm particles, 500 Å pore size) columns
coupled to each other with the exception of one experiment, in which
the column at the terminus was packed with particles with an average
pore size of 328 Å. In all cases, the first column contained
unmodified silica particles, whereas the latter two were packed with
XB-C18 modified silica particles.

For LC × LC experiments,
in the valve used for modulation,
160 μL homemade loops or traps were installed, depending on
the application. Phenomenex SecurityGuard ULTRA (P/N: AJ0–9000, V0 = 0.4 μL) guard-column holders were
used in conjunction with UHPLC C18 2.1 mm i.d. SecurityGuard ULTRA
cartridges (P/N: AJ0-8782). In the case of one trap per modulation
loop, the trap was directly connected to the valve with tubing (Agilent,
P/N: 5067-4650, 150 × 0.12 mm i.d.), connecting the outlet to
the second valve connection. For experiments utilizing two traps per
modulation loop, the two traps were directly coupled to each other.
One end of the coupled traps was connected to the valve using a male-to-female
tubing piece (Agilent, P/N: G1316-87313, 70 × 0.12 mm i.d., m/f),
whereas standard tubing was used to couple the other end to the valve
(Agilent, P/N: 5067-4649, 90 × 0.12 mm).

For experiments
that required mixing, the flow eluting from the
HDC column was combined with the flow from a pump delivering THF using
a stainless-steel tee-connection (P/N: U-428, IDEX Corp, Illinois).
The combined flow was then routed to the Agilent Jet Weaver V35 or
V100 mixer (model G4220-60006) of the first-dimension binary pump
using 500 × 0.12 mm stainless-steel tubing. The outlet of the
mixer was connected with the valve using the same dimensions of tubing.

Configuration Chromatographic System
System A: Depending
on the type of experiment, the equipment above was used in a specific
setup. For one-dimensional HDC and SEC experiments (system A), one
channel of the binary pump was connected to the autosampler, which
was coupled to the column(s) and then linked to the DAD. LC ×
LC experiments were performed with the instrumental setup illustrated
in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic overview
of the setup used for HDC × SEC experiments.

System B: for studying the effects of various instrumental
parameters
including the dissolution process, modulation, traps and resulting
SEC separation, the setup of Figure 1 was used without the HDC column (system B) as the
experiments all comprised the analysis of a sample of 498 nm PS nanoparticles,
for which no HDC separation was required. The first valve shown in Figure 1 was bypassed.

System C: all other LC × LC experiments utilized the system
shown in Figure 1 without
any modifications (system C). The first valve allowed for the redirection
of the flow to waste during the flush program of the HDC column. The
first detector functioned to monitor the premature elution of analytes
from the traps.

In all setups, the diode-array detectors (DAD)
recorded the full
spectra from 190 to 640 nm, although the chromatograms shown in this
paper reflect specific wavelengths. For 1D-HDC and 1D-SEC analyses,
254 nm was used as detection wavelength. Chromatograms recorded using
setups B and C were obtained at 210 nm with 230 nm as reference (bandwidth
4 nm). For all experiments, the sampling rate of the detector was
160 Hz. The temperature for the stationary-phase-assisted modulation
and SEC separation in all experiments was 60 °C, which lowered
the operating pressures in comparison with room temperature operation.
The modulation volumes were always emptied in the counter-current
(i.e., backflush) mode, to flush out any nondissolved particles into
the SEC dimension and protect the traps.

Chemicals
Nonstabilized
tetrahydrofuran (THF, HPLC-S
grade) was obtained from Biosolve (Valkenswaard, The Netherlands).
Sodium dihydrogen phosphate (cat. no.: 106346, monohydrate) was obtained
from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Sodium dodecyl sulfate (cat. no.:
L4509-250G), Brij L23 nonionic surfactant (cat. no.: B4184-100 ML,
specified as 30% w/v solution in water) and sodium azide (cat. no.:
S2002-100G) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany).
Polystyrene standards (PS) for determining MWD calibration curves
were obtained from Polymer Laboratories (now Agilent Technologies,
Church Stretton, Shropshire, UK). The 3000 series Nanosphere polystyrene
nanoparticle standards were obtained from ThermoFisher Scientific
(Bremen, Germany). The used particle diameters were 903 nm ±
12 nm (P/N: 3900A), 498 nm ± 9 nm (P/N: 3500A), 216 nm ±
4 nm (P/N: 3220A), 102 nm ± 3 nm (P/N: 3100A) and 46 nm ±
2 nm (P/N: 3050A). The polyacrylate nanoparticle samples of 76 and
59 nm (average particle sizes determined by 1D-HDC analysis) were
provided by DSM Coating Resins (Waalwijk, The Netherlands).

Preparation
Methods
For creating a calibration curve,
all PS standards were dissolved in THF at concentrations of approximately
0.2 mg mL–1. A stock solution of HDC buffer was
created by dissolving 6.2 g sodium dihydrogen orthophosphate, 10.0
g sodium lauryl sulfate, 134 mL Brij L23 nonionic surfactant (specified
as a 30% (w/v) solution in water), and 4.0 g sodium azide in 866.7
mL Milli-Q purified water. The stock solution was diluted 20 times
with Milli-Q purified water before use. Concentrations of the obtained
PS and polyacrylate nanoparticles were reported as % (w/w). PS nanoparticles
were diluted 10-fold to a concentration of approximately 0.1% (w/w).
Polyacrylate nanoparticles were diluted to concentrations between
0.1 and 0.5% (w/w). For dilution, the buffer utilized for HDC was
used.

Analytical Methods
For one-dimensional HDC analysis,
system A (see Configuration Chromatographic System) was used with the flow rate set at 1 mL min–1 using the buffer as prepared according to Preparation
Methods for the mobile phase. The analysis time was 15 min.
The recorded pressure drop was on average 80 bar (8 MPa) at this flow
rate. For investigating the effect of incorporating a flush program
in the HDC separation on the width of the observed analyte bands,
the flow rate was set as follows: 1 mL min–1 from
0.0 to 11.9 min and 0.04 mL min–1 from 11.9 to 60.0
min. The injection volume was 20 μL.

For one-dimensional
SEC analysis, system A was used with the column combinations and one
trap (for a more accurate comparison) as specified in the Instrumentation section and the flow rate set
at 3.0 mL min–1. The mobile phase was 100% nonstabilized
THF. The analysis time was 5 min. The injection volume was 5 μL.
Typical operating pressures were 750–800 bar (75–80
MPa).

For experiments utilizing system B, the flow rates of
the first-dimension
pump A and dissolution pump B were varied, as is described in the
section Coupling of SEC and HDC. The second-dimension
flow rate was 3.3 mL min–1. The modulation time
was 36 s. The injection volume was 20 μL.

For LC ×
LC experiments, system C was used. The first-dimension
pump A operated at a flow rate of 40 μL min–1, unless stated otherwise, with an initial flush program analogous
to that reported for system A. The dissolution pump B operated at
a flow rate of 200 μL min–1, unless specified
differently. The second-dimension pump C operated at 3.3 mL min–1, unless indicated otherwise. The analysis time was
60 min. The modulation time was 36 s. Observed backpressures ranged
from 800 to 900 bar using one trap to 900–1000 bar using two
traps, depending on the conditions of the traps. The injection volume
was 20 μL.

Data Treatment
Chromatograms obtained
from LC ×
LC experiments were processed and analyzed by software written in-house
in a MATLAB 2015a (Mathworks, Woodshole, MA) environment. For chromatograms
recorded using system B, specific modulations are used and displayed
in the Results and Discussion. To justly compare
the effect of system parameters, such as the dissolution-solvent composition,
mixing volumes, and trapping performance, on the SEC separation, the
same modulation cycle was consistently selected (fourth modulation,
from 1.8 to 2.4 min) and converted to the τ-scale (relative
to τ = 1 at t0) and used for comparison.
To allow calculation of the second derivatives without obstructing
noise signals, a wide Savitsky-Golay smoothening filter was applied
to all chromatograms used to construct Figure 4B (see Section S-5).

Results and Discussion
Hydrodynamic Chromatography
Hydrodynamic
chromatography
(HDC) is a technique in which macromolecules and particles are separated
according to size in a column packed with solid or porous beads. It
is a rapid and, in principle, convenient method to obtain a fingerprint
of the size distribution of particles. Large particles will migrate
at average velocities corresponding to the faster streamlines, whereas
the smaller particles can also occupy the much slower streamlines
close to the walls of the channel (See Section S-1 for a more detailed explanation).

While HDC separations
can be carried out on columns with porous particles, we chose to utilize
nonporous particles as the stationary phase to rule out separation
based on permeation. For such stationary phases, the HDC domain utilizes
a rather narrow domain generally between 0.8 < τ < 1.0,
where τ is the ratio between the analyte elution time (or volume)
and the dead time (or volume) of the column (τ = te/t0 = Ve/V0). However, the used column
featured a dead volume of approximately 14 mL. As a result, at a flow
rate of 1 mL min–1, the first 12 mL (V0 ≈ 14 mL; τ ≈ 0.85) of the separation
fell outside of the HDC domain and were not helpful (see Figure S-1A). In LC × LC, with a first-dimension
flow rate at least 1 order of magnitude lower, the prospect of waiting
for this volume to elute is certainly not attractive.

Fortunately,
the band broadening does not heavily depend on the
flow rate (see Figure S-1 for an expanded
explanation).26−28 Consequently, we increased the flow rate to flush
through the first 11.9 mL of eluent. This essentially reduced the
analysis time for the 1D-HDC method to 3 min, and the analysis time
for the 2D-LC method to 60 min, as will be shown later.

With
the use of the developed method, a calibration curve using
the PS standards could be constructed (see Figure S-1D). To determine the reliability of the pump carrying out
the flush program in terms of displacement volume (and thus the variation
in the calibration curve), the experiments were repeated five times.
A standard deviation of 0.11 min was found at 40 μL min–1, corresponding with 4.4 μL in terms of elution
volume. It was concluded that the variation was not significant.

Size-Exclusion Chromatography
While SEC has been often
applied as second-dimension separation,29,30 there is still
room for improvement. SEC separations are typically carried out on
relatively large columns, as the extent of separation (i.e., the difference
ΔV in the elution volumes of different analytes)
is proportional to the total pore volume.31 However, since the 2D analysis typically has to be performed
under significant time-pressure, very fast separations are desired.
Fast separations are achieved in |LC by using short columns packed
with (very) small particles. We have recently investigated the feasibility
of using core–shell particles as the stationary phase and found
that, within specific domains, the gained efficiency in SEC compensates
for the loss of resolution as a result of a loss in pore volume.25 To obtain as much resolution as possible under
ultrahigh-pressure LC (UHPLC) conditions, three columns were coupled,
the first of which was a nonmodified silica column to filter out any
remaining water from the first-dimension fraction. After each experiment,
all columns were regenerated to purge any remaining water.

One
advantage of genuine SEC (in absence of adsorptive interactions) is
that no compounds elute in the exclusion volume of the separation.
This conveniently allowed the use of overlapping injections (Figure 2). With the three
columns coupled together, the total column volume was approximately
5.1 mL. A calibration curve was recorded, which revealed that the
total exclusion limit was around 3.6 mL. Consequently, the SEC separation
could never comprise a range larger than approximately 1.5 mL or 30
s at a flow rate of 3.3 mL min–1. We therefore opted
to use a modulation time of 36 s, which meant that at any point of
the second-dimension separation there would be three modulations present
simultaneously inside the column combination.

Figure 2 Theoretical sketch illustrating
the principle of overlapping injections.
The modulation time is adapted such that the sample zones of subsequent
injections do not overlap. Note: the three SEC columns coupled together
for our study are shown here as a single column for simplicity (see
also Figure S-2 for an illustration of
how the corresponding chromatogram is established).

Coupling of SEC and HDC
The HDC
and SEC separations
were combined using the setup shown in Figure 1. Combination of the HDC and SEC separations
required overcoming a set of challenges. In the HDC separation, PS
particles were separated based on their particle sizes. In the second
dimension, it was envisaged that the polymer molecules that make up
the polymeric nanoparticles would be separated by SEC. For the latter
purpose, it was required to transform the sample analytes from particles
to a mixture of the composing polymer molecules. We thus combined
the HDC-effluent with THF (pump B) through the use of a tee-piece.
The resulting solvent blend was then mixed in an Agilent Jet Weaver
mixer, belonging to one of the binary pumps. Such a mixer is usually
used to mix two mobile phase components in gradient analysis. Due
to the presence of THF, the nanoparticle dispersion destabilizes and
the polymers dissolve in the organic solvent. In this section, we
discuss the different challenges and effects using the separation
of a standard mixture of PS nanoparticles with an average particle
size of 498 nm as an example (see section Chemicals).

The presence of water in the polymer solution greatly complicated
the SEC separation due to significant adsorption effects. Moreover,
the solutions transferred to the SEC column were too dilute to yield
clearly detectable signals, as is illustrated in Figure 3A. Relative to the dead volume
signal (at τ = 1), the signal of the polymer fraction was diminished.
To solve both the adsorption and dilution problems, the loops were
replaced by traps with very short connections toward the valve to
minimize extraneous volumes.

PS nanoparticles analyzed
with setup B (see Configuration Chromatographic
System) under various conditions. (A) No traps. (B) One trap
(broken, green line) or two traps (solid, blue line). (C) 35 μL
mixer (broken, purple line) or 100 μL mixer (solid, orange line).
(D) Effect of the pore size in the last of three SEC columns; 328-Å
(broken, blue line) vs 500 Å (solid orange line). Chromatograms
were recorded using a 2D setup. They reflect one of many, highly repeatable
modulations (see Data Treatment).

The effect of the use of a trap
for each loop is shown in Figure 3B (blue, broken line).
Indeed, the traps appeared to retain the dissolved polymers very well.
Thanks to the small connection volumes to and from the traps, most
of the water could be removed, while the polymers were retained on
the traps. However, the molecular-weight distribution (MWD) was not
consistent with reference data, especially in the low-molecular weight
region (close to t0). Therefore, a second
trap was added to each modulation connection. The addition of a second
trap resulted in an improved MWD observed (Figure 3B, orange, solid line). This can be understood
by realizing that the traps are in fact 3 mm long columns. While most
polymer molecules are well-retained, low-molar-mass polymers may elute
with the many column volumes of solvent that are flushed through the
loops during each modulation (adsorption) cycle. The second trap catches
most of the low-molar-mass polymers that are eluted from the first
trap.

The Agilent Jet Weaver mixer features two modes of use,
offering
a mixing volume of 35 or 100 μL. To study the effect of the
mixing volume, chromatograms were recorded using both mixing volumes.
The results are shown in Figure 3C. The yield was found to be improved for the larger
mixing volume (orange, solid line as compared to the purple, broken
line), and the mixing volume of 100 μL was used for all the
following experiments.

All experiments used three coupled SEC
columns, each featuring
core–shell stationary phase particles with pore sizes averaging
500 Å. To offer more resolution in the low-molar-mass region,
the possibility of replacing the last column with one containing particles
with smaller pore sizes (328 Å) was investigated. Unfortunately,
the obtained traces (Figure 3D) suggested a pore-size mismatch when using the 328 Å
terminus column combination (green, broken line), in comparison with
the use of three 500-Å columns (blue, solid line).

Effect of Dissolution-Solvent
Composition and Flow Rate
Not surprisingly, the dissolution
ratio of analyte-containing-HDC
eluent with THF proved to greatly affect several factors related to
the SEC performance, including the consistency of the MWD and the
performance of the traps. To assess this performance, we used the
MWD obtained from 1D-UHPLC SEC analysis of the 498 nm PS nanoparticle
standard recorded using exclusively THF in the mobile phase as a benchmark
(see Figure S-4). The flow rate for the
HDC separation was fixed to 40 μL min–1 to
yield a reasonable analysis time. The flow rate for the THF pump was
varied to allow investigation of the effect of the mixing ratio and
the total flow rate on the SEC performance (Figure 4).

Figure 4 (A) SEC chromatograms of 498 nm PS nanoparticle obtained using
different solvent ratios for in-line dissolution (see Figure S-3 for all chromatograms). (B) Second
derivatives of chromatograms of all investigated solvent ratios for
dissolution. Percentages represent fraction of aqueous first-dimension
eluent. Each inflection point is visible as peak or valley and represents
a distortion in the SEC curve.

The resulting chromatograms confirmed the effect of the mixing
ratio (Figure 4A, see Figure S-3 for all chromatograms). One of the
observed effects was significant distortion in the SEC separation
resulting in irregular peaks. To assess the extent of these inconsistencies,
the second derivative was calculated for the SEC domains of each chromatogram Figure 4B. Each inflection
point corresponds to an irregularity in the SEC behavior. The extent
of distortions was found to be minimal for a ratio of 17% (HDC buffer/THF
[17:83, v/v]). This was in accordance with the resemblance to the
benchmark when using this composition (see Figure S-4).

However, it is good to realize that an increase
in THF content
under the present conditions results in an increase in the total flow
rate and which increases the risk of (low-molar-mass) polymers eluting
from the traps (see also Figure 3B). To assess this issue, the SEC elution curve was
integrated relative to the baseline within the domain of the calibration
curve (thus not including the rise of the signal toward the dead volume
marker).

The integration area was defined as the trap yield
and is shown
in Table 1. Generally,
two trends can be seen. First, high amounts of THF allow good dissolution
of the particles, which is reflected in the relatively high trap yield
compared to lower amounts of THF. However, higher amounts of THF also
appear to hinder reliable trapping of the analytes with the yield
decreasing slightly above 83%, possibly due to retention problems.
Second, relatively high amounts of aqueous buffer (and thus analytes)
of course lead to lower dilution factors and thus increasing yields,
until the fraction of THF becomes too small to timely dilute the entire
particle. Compositions with more than 22% aqueous buffer resulted
in occasional trap clogging. Above 30% aqueous buffer no signal was
observed in the SEC dimension and almost every experiment resulted
in clogging of the traps. The above observations point to an optimum
at around 17% aqueous buffer and 83% THF. Such a composition also
showed favorable results in Figure 4B and thus was chosen for the remainder of the study.

of 903, 498, and 216 nm PS and 76 and 59 nm polyacrylate nanoparticles,
all at concentrations of 0.1–0.5% (w/w) (see Preparation Methods), was injected and analyzed using the
developed separation system. The resulting LC × LC (HDC ×
SEC) chromatogram is shown in Figure 5. The corresponding information related to the particle-size
distribution and the molecular weight distribution was tentatively
added on the top and right axes, respectively. As can be seen, the
three different kinds of PS particles are clearly separated from each
other and from the polyacrylate particles. This is not entirely the
case for the two sizes of polyacrylate particles, where clearly the
resolution is insufficient. One solution here could be to use an HDC
column covering a range of smaller particle sizes.

Figure 5 HDC × SEC-DAD chromatogram
of a mixture of nanoparticles containing
PS 903 nm, PS 498 nm, PS 216 nm, polyacrylate 76 nm, and polyacrylate
59 nm. The corresponding information related to the particle size
distribution and molecular weight distribution was tentatively added
to the top and right axes, respectively.

The obtained separation also gives good insight in the differences
in molecular weight distributions of the polymers, with larger particles
generally comprising larger polymers. For some particles, the MWD
was found to be narrower than for other particles.

The chromatogram
in Figure 5 displays
some slight perpetual distortions on one of the
modulation traps. The extent of the distortion increases with analysis
time and can be explained from deteriorating performance of one of
the modulation traps. This exposes a weakness of the present HDC ×
SEC separation system. We observed that minor obstruction points form
over time (e.g., by noneluting analytes or poorly processed nanoparticles),
causing partial blockage of the traps and resulting in increased pressure
drops. These obstructions may affect the loop filling, trapping efficiency,
and the subsequent SEC separation because the extent of blockage is
unlikely to be the same for both loops, causing the performance of
the traps to become unbalanced. Indeed, for reliable performance it
is imperative that both traps are as identical as possible. Fortunately,
the traps could be regenerated in most cases by ultrasonication.

Another discussion point is the width of the peaks in HDC, which
limits the extent of separation. One solution could be to mathematically
reduce the peak width as is done in analytical (one-dimensional) HDC
practice.32 Furthermore, the large separation
volumes of the HDC method used in this study are subject to discussion,
and this is something that our group aims to investigate.

The
extraneous volumes prior, during, and after the mixing process
are also a source of concern. In the current setup, the first-dimension
column is connected by a long piece of capillary tubing to the 100
μL Jet Weaver V100 mixer and the exit of the mixer is again
connected by a long piece of tubing back to the modulation valve.
Ideally, the first-dimension column would be directly connected to
an extremely low-volume mixer inside the column oven. In the present
setup, we observed significant peak tailing in the SEC dimension under
UHPLC conditions.

Ultimately, we aim to combine the HDC separation
with other retention
mechanisms, such as gradient-elution reversed-phase or normal-phase
LC or ion-exchange chromatography, to characterize nanoparticles consisting
of copolymers or charged polymers. We envisage that, depending on
the type of application, different stationary phases can be used to
retain the analytes.

Conclusion
An online separation
system for the comprehensive analysis of nanoparticle
formulations based on LC × LC technology was successfully developed.
The method incorporates in-line transformation of the particulate
sample to a molecular solution. It allows relating the particle-size
distribution of the particles to the molecular-weight distribution
of the constituting polymers. In the first dimension, hydrodynamic
chromatography (HDC) was used to obtain information on the particle-size
distribution. The first 12 mL of the 14 mL dead volume of the column
were flushed through rapidly at the start of each analysis to reduce
the analysis time without sacrificing chromatographic efficiency.
The remaining 2 mL contained the effective HDC separation and was
fractioned after blending with THF using a mixer. A ratio of 17% first-dimension
aqueous buffer eluent/83% THF (v/v) was found to provide good yields
of polymers with respect to dissolution and trapping efficiency. A
mixing volume of 100 μL was found to improve the consistency
of the SEC separation in comparison with a 35 μL mixing volume.
To prevent adsorption effects in the SEC separation, the water was
eliminated from the dissolution mixture using traps in the modulation
loops. Two traps connected in series in each loop were found to yield
a SEC separation that resembled the results obtained in conventional
off-line SEC. Core–shell particles were used at UHPLC conditions
in the second dimension to provide the necessary resolution. To efficiently
utilize the separation space and reduce the modulation times, overlapping
injections were applied.

Parameters such as the particle-size
distribution, the MMD of the
intrinsic polymers, and other properties greatly affect the performance
of coatings. For example, smaller particles provide better chemical
stability and, more importantly, optical properties of the coating,
whereas large polymers improve the mechanical stability of the coating.
Often, bi- or multimodal (co)polymer distributions are employed to
obtain specific properties, including surface reflectance and tactual
perception. The developed separation platform visualizes the information
needed to reach the best compromise.
