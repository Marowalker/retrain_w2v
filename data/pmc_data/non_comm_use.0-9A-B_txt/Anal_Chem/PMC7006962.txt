Synthetic
cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs), termed “Spice”
or “K2”, are molecules that emulate the effects of the
active ingredient of marijuana, and they have gained enormous popularity
over the past decade. SCRAs are Schedule 1 drugs that are highly prevalent
in the U.K. prison system and among homeless populations. SCRAs are
highly potent and addictive. With no way to determine the dose/amount
at the point-of care, they pose severe health risks to users, including
psychosis, stroke, epileptic seizures, and they can kill. SCRAs are
chemically diverse, with over a hundred compounds used as recreational
drugs. The chemical diversity of SCRA structures presents a challenge
in developing detection modalities. Typically, GC-MS is used for chemical
identification; however, this cannot be in place in most settings
where detection is critical, e.g., in hospital Emergency Departments,
in custody suites/prisons, or among homeless communities. Ideally,
real time, point-of-care identification of SCRAs is desirable to direct
the care pathway of overdoses and provide information for informed
consent. Herein, we show that fluorescence spectral fingerprinting
can be used to identify the likely presence of SCRAs, as well as provide
more specific information on structural class and concentration (∼1
μg mL–1). We demonstrate that that fluorescence
spectral fingerprints, combined with numerical modeling, can detect
both parent and combusted material, and such fingerprinting is also
practical for detecting them in oral fluids. Our proof-of-concept
study suggests that, with development, the approach could be useful
in a range of capacities, notably in harm reduction for users of Spice/K2.

New psychoactive
substances
(NPSs), formerly known as “legal highs”, are compounds
(not necessarily new, but now growing at ∼100 per annum) that
are abused—they require new analytical methods, especially
for point-of-care/in-the-field detection.1 Up-to-date testing of such illicit drugs in oral fluid is a major
goal as it lacks an accurate method with suitable sensitivity that
avoids false-positive and -negative responses.2 There is a clear need for accurate field testing of illicit drugs
enabling immediate action to be taken at the scene.3 For health-care applications, ideally detection at the
point-of-care is desirable, from both raw street-material and from
a user sample, e.g., oral fluid, blood, or urine. Here we demonstrate
that the combined excitation/emission spectrum is a sensitive spectral
fingerprint of different synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs)
known as “Spice” or “K2”. Moreover, we
demonstrate that this approach can detect low concentrations of SCRAs
from street material, can detect the presence of combusted SCRAs,
and is practical in their analysis even in oral fluids. We therefore
propose a use for this approach in patient triage to manage overdoses
and with application in harm reduction strategies.

SCRAs are
a family of compounds designed to mimic the effects of
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), the psychoactive
molecules in cannabis, by binding to CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors and acting as agonists for receptor function.
CB1 receptors are most commonly found in the peripheral
and central nervous system, while the structurally smaller CB2 receptors are mostly expressed within the immune system.
Under normal endogenous conditions, these cannabinoid receptors have
been found to modulate a variety of physiological and cognitive processes
including fertility, pregnancy, pre- and postnatal development, appetite,
pain sensation, inflammation, mood, and memory,4−6 causing a number
of major side effects, both psychological and physiological. These
include, but are not limited to, acute kidney injury, vomiting, cardiovascular
complications,7,8 agitation, irritability, confusion,
hallucinations, delusions, psychosis, and even death.9 The severity of these side effects are thought to be due
to SCRAs having unusually high binding affinities at CB receptors,
coupled with acting as full agonists of CB receptors. Conversely,
CBD and THC are only partial agonists of these receptors.10

At present a number of the most common
SCRAs are Schedule 1 in
the U.S. and Class B drugs in the U.K. and thus have criminal charges
associated with their production, distribution, and possession. However,
novel compounds are readily synthesized which circumvent some legal
restrictions.11,12

Structurally, SCRAs share
a common overall chemical architecture
comprising a “tail”, “core”, “linker”,
and “ring” position as shown in Figure 1. Novel SCRAs can be developed simply by
substituting one or more of these structural motifs, producing novel
compounds by different combinations of moieties. The range of substituents
is given in Supporting Information Table
S1 as reported by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug
Addiction (EMCDDA). However, this list rapidly changes. The ease with
which new SCRAs are developed12 has led
to the existence of a large number of known SCRAs, as recorded by
the EMCDDA.13,14

Figure 1 Structural overview of SCRAs. A range
of specific substituents
are given in Table S1.

SCRAs cannot be detected or identified using the standard urine-based
enzyme-multiplied immune test for cannabis usage.12 Immunoassays that can test for specific SCRAs have been
developed.15 However, this class of drug
is so numerous (Figure 1 and Table S1) and novel compounds are
synthesized so readily12,16 that such assays quickly become
obsolete due to their specificity. Detection of SCRAs can be achieved
using spectrometric and spectroscopic approaches including LC-QTOF-MS,16 LC-MS-MS,17 GC-MS,12,18,19 NMR,12,18,19 ATR-IR,20 and
IMS.21,22

Despite the side effects, the potency
and low cost of SCRAs have
meant that they are widely abused across the world.23 Typically, users will not know which SCRA they have purchased
and the amount of SCRA varies hugely from ∼5 to 100 mg.11 It is therefore common for users to overdose.
At present, there is no immediate point-of-care test that can inform
the care pathway for users who have overdosed on SCRAs. There is therefore
value in identifying SCRAs as a general group, detecting individual
SCRAs or SCRA mixtures. The vast majority of SCRAs have an indole
or indazole group at the core position (Figure 1). Indeed, the recent rise of indole-based
SCRAs is thought to be a continued effort to circumvent the Markush
structure-based legal restrictions on previous generations of SCRAs,
in which molecules with an indole core were uncommon. The fluorescent
behavior of indole- and indazole-based molecules is heavily influenced
by both the chemical substituents bound to the ring systems and the
compound’s immediate solvent environment.24−31 For example, Carić et al. demonstrated that a range of substituted
indole-3 acetic acids show significant variation in absorption and
fluorescence spectra.27 Given the potential
sensitivity of fluorescence to both the immediate solvent environment
and chemical substituents, we reasoned that structurally distinct
SCRAs would produce unique fluorescence spectral fingerprints, related
to the specific chemical composition at each of the positions as shown
in Figure 1 as well
as the analyte solvent.

Materials and Methods
Collection of Fluorescence
Spectral Fingerprints
All
fluorescence measurements were taken using a PerkinElmer LS50B luminescence
spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) attached to a water bath
to allow for temperature regulation. Sample scans and background measurements
were taken at 20 °C. The excitation and emission slit widths
were set to be equal during each scan. The width of these slits was
varied between 2.5 and 12 nm depending on the signal. In each case,
the corresponding background measurement was directly subtracted,
particularly to remove contributions from Raman scattering. The data
shown have had the contributions from excitation light and second
order scattering removed.

Sample Preparation
Some samples
were extracted from
(Police seized) street material prepared as we have recently described.18,19 Some SCRAs were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI,
USA). Samples were dissolved in either deionized water, purified using
an Elix essential water purification system (Merck Millipore, Burlington,
MA, USA), or HPLC methanol >99.9% purity (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis,
MO, USA). Oral fluid samples were collected from volunteers who confirmed
no legal or illegal drug use in the preceding month. The oral fluid
samples were passed through a 0.44 μm syringe-driven filter.

Results and Discussion
Unique FSFs from Different SCRAs
Figure 2 shows the
combined excitation/emission matrix
for different SCRAs, including three where the core group is an indazole
(Figure 2A–-C)
and three where the core group is an indole (Figure 2D–F). These excitation/emission matrices
represent a fluorescence spectral fingerprint (FSF) of the individual
SCRAs. That the structure of the FSF for each SCRA is consistent across
a range of concentrations is discussed below.

Figure 2 FSFs for a range of SCRAs.
FSFs are shown next to the associated
SCRA structure with either an indazole (A–C) or indole (E,
F) at the core position (Figure 1). Coloration represents relative emission with the
maximum at 1.

The indoles each have a highly
conjugated ring system at the “ring”
position: iodophenyl (Figure 2D), naphthyl (Figure 2E), and quinolinyl (Figure 2F) groups. The resulting FSF is complex in each case.
AM-694 shows a feature attributable to the indole group (λex ∼275 nm; λem ∼350 nm,). A
similar feature is also apparent with JWH-018. The observed FSF will
also be affected by the presence of a cross-conjugated system spanning
the ring systems, particularly where the linker group is a simple
ketone (methanone) (Figure 2D,E). Indeed, with a carboxylate linker (Figure 2F), the FSF has a unique structure
not obviously attributable to an indole or quinoline. For the indoles
studied, it appears the FSF is particularly sensitive to the nature
of the ring group and variance in this position gives a unique FSF
that is readily identifiable. We note that much of the FSF for the
SCRAs with multiple chromophores appears to be diffuse and broad.
However, the FSFs are consistent as shown below.

In contrast
to the indoles studied, the indazoles (Figure 2A–C) lack a conjugated
ring system at the ring position so the observed FSF is essentially
entirely dominated by the indazole moiety fluorophore (Figure 2A–C; λex ∼300 nm; λem ∼355 nm). To the eye,
the indazole FSFs appear essentially identical. However, the fingerprints
are quantifiably unique, showing characteristic differences in both
the excitation and emission axes. Where these differences are not
obvious to the eye, the FSFs can be fit with a function that accurately
models the spectral data, 1  eq 1 is a modified Fraser–Suzuki
function that models a sum of two-dimensionally skewed Gaussian functions,
where A is the amplitude, w the
full width at half-maximum (fwhm), and b a skewness
parameter. The number of skewed Gaussians used to accurately model
a given FSF is determined by increasing the number of skewed Gaussians
until the residual of the fit and fitting statistics (R2) stop changing meaningfully. Similar functions are typically
used to model excitation/emission spectra individually, and the quality
of the fit to the individual FSFs is excellent. Panels A–C
of Figure 3 show the
results of fitting eq 1 to each of the indazole SCRAs across a range of different concentrations,
and panels D–F of Figure 3 show the resulting fit parameters, demonstrating that
each of the indazole fingerprints are quantifiably unique. That is,
each of the parameters extracted from eq 1 are different for each of the indazole SCRAs. Moreover,
panels D and E of Figure 3 show that the differences in the FSFs for the indazole SCRAs
are highly reproducible across a range of different concentrations
(∼1–5 μg mL–1). As we discuss
below, this is similar to detection levels of THC in saliva and so
is a physiologically relevant range of detection.

Figure 3 Surface fits of eq 1 to the data shown in Figure 2A–C (panel
A, 5F-ADB; panel B, AB-FUBINACA; panel C,
5F-AKB48). The resulting parameters from fitting to eq 1 are shown in panels D–F,
for maxima of excitation/emission, spectral width, and skewness, respectively.
Error bars are the standard deviation from fitting three to five different
concentrations of each SCRA (∼1–5 μg mL–1). Color levels as in Figure 2 (relative emission).

5F-ADB and 5F-AKB-48 provide an excellent point of comparison since
the only difference between these SCRAs is at the ring position, with
a tert-leucinate and adamantyl group, respectively.
Despite these groups not being fluorescent or absorptive in the wavelength
range studied, they are apparently sufficient to affect the FSF appreciably
(Figure 3D–F).
These data therefore suggest the highly sensitive nature of the indole/indazole
groups to a range of physical properties that affect the fluorescence
characteristics, allowing specific discrimination using quantified
FSFs. Moreover, the data point to the future potential of using the
FSFs to assign specific chemical features. We see particular potential
in identifying cross-conjugation at the linker position given the
sensitivity shown for the indoles above.

Concentration and Solvent
Dependence on SCRA FSFs
Potentially
the concentration of a SCRA could be inferred from the intensity of
the emission at a specific wavelength, on the basis of a known calibration
curve. That is, fluorophore concentration should have a linear dependence
with respect to emission intensity. Using fluorescence intensity readings
in this way is restricted to relatively low concentrations because
at elevated concentrations the observed intensity becomes significantly
affected by the inner filter effect.32,33 That is, the
fluorescence intensity stops having a linear dependence with concentration
and ultimately decreases with increasing concentration. Figure 4 shows AB FUBINACA FSFs across
a range of concentrations (Figure 4A–D), and the quality of the FSF remains excellent
even at low concentrations (<1 μg mL–1).
Clearly, even lower concentrations could easily be detected by using
a more intense light source (excitation power in the present case
is ∼0.1 μW) or through longer acquisition times. For
example, UV LEDs have become increasingly powerful (mW range) and
with relatively tight spectral bandwidths (∼10 nm) and these
very much lend themselves to portable applications.

for different concentrations of AB FUBINACA with decreasing concentration
shown in panels A → D. (E) Plot of concentration versus peak
emission intensity. The red dashed line shows the linear dependence
of the lower (first three) concentrations with the higher concentration
deviating from linearity as discussed in the main text. Color levels
as in Figure 2B (relative
emission).

Figure 4E shows
the plot of AB FUBINACA concentration versus peak emission intensity.
As expected, these data show an essentially linear relationship at
low concentrations (∼1 μg mL–1). At
elevated concentrations the linear relationship begins to break down
as the inner filter effect becomes apparent.32,33 Other SCRAs show a similar relationship and a linear range as shown
for AM-694 in Figure S1. Therefore, these
data suggest that the concentration of SCRAs could potentially be
inferred from the absolute magnitude of the intensity reading, as
long as it is within the linear range of detection (i.e., concentrations
below where the inner filter effect becomes significant). Clearly
there is also the potential to dilute samples.

Solvent specific
effects on the FSFs are important since detecting
FSFs in complex biological material (e.g., oral fluid as below) is
our goal. We observe changes in emission intensity depending on solvent
but in an SCRA dependent manner. For example, AB FUBINACA shows essentially
similar intensities in either water or methanol, whereas AM-694 is
significantly more emissive in methanol than water.

These differences
in intensity might have a component of solubility.
For example, AKB-48 is essentially completely insoluble in H2O owing to the extreme hydrophobicity of the adamantyl group (Figure 2) at the ring position
(Figure 1). Beyond
an absolute change in emission intensity at the same concentration,
the structure of the FSF shows additional changes with respect to
both excitation and emission wavelengths. AB FUBINACA in H2O shows significant shifts compared to when dissolved in MeOH (Figure S2), in terms of both the absolute peak
position but also spectral width and skewness as assessed from fitting
to eq 1 (Figure S2A; red cross corresponding to MeOH data
as Figure 3D). The
effect is primarily on the emission spectrum, with a red shift in
the maximum emission intensity (+∼15 nm). We observe an essentially
identical red shift in H2O for 5F-ADB (Figure S3). The differential effect of the solvent is more
noticeable still with AM-694 with a global change in the FSF, though
retaining a largely diffuse FSF (Figure S4).

We note that the relationship between concentration and
peak intensity
is essentially the same in either MeOH or H2O (Figures 4 and S1–S4). Our data therefore are consistent
with the conclusion that the SCRA FSFs are not just extremely sensitive
to chemical diversity but also to the solvent used. That is, the FSF
will need to be specific to the milieu in which the SCRA is present.
These data therefore point to the potential of differential solvent
measurements to enhance the discriminatory ability of the FSFs.

Unique FSFs from a Smoking Model and in Oral Fluid
The FSFs
shown in Figure 2 are
either extracted and purified from street material (5F-ADB,
AM-694, 5F-PB-22) or purchased pure from a supplier (AB-FUBINACA,
JWH-018, and 5F-AKB-48). However, SCRAs are most commonly smoked,
meaning the SCRA itself will be combusted in the presence of the (typically)
plant material upon which the SCRA is delivered.

Recently, we
have developed and applied a realistic smoking model to show the breakdown
products for a range of SCRAs (including 5F-ADB, AM-694, and 5F-PB-22),
assessed by UHPLC-TOF-ESI-MS and GC-MS.19 In that study, we found essentially no contribution from the plant
matter nor any tobacco present in the smoking model. Instead, the
smoking model shows the presence of the parent compound in each case
and some combustion products. These combustion products include 1-(5-fluoropentyl)-indole
and 1-pentyl-indole (from 5F-PB-22). Panels A–C of Figure 5 show the FSFs for
5F-ADB, AM-694, and 5F-PB-22, respectively, and the corresponding
FSFs from the smoking model are shown in Figure 5D–F.

Figure 5 Effect of pyrolysis on SCRA FSFs. (A–C)
FSFs for parent
compounds as in Figure 2 (panel A, 5F-ADB; panel B, AM-694; panel C, 5F-PB-22). (D–F)
Corresponding FSFs of combusted material via our smoking model. Color
levels as in Figure 2 (relative emission).

From Figure 5A–F,
the most noticeable changes are with 5F-PB-22, where the notional
quinoline emission becomes less obvious and is replaced by an FSF
that is more reminiscent of an indole. This correlates well with the
findings from the smoking model analysis (above), where 5F-PB-22 shows
the most significant combustion products of the three SCRAs, a substituted
indole. The FSFs therefore mirror the analysis from UHPLC-TOF-ESI-MS
and GC-MS,19 albeit providing a more qualitative
description. Observing this correlation is therefore further evidence
for the sensitivity of the FSFs for each SCRA and suggests the FSFs
could potentially be used where there is a heterogeneous mixture of
SCRAs/combustion products.

Ultimately, we aim to detect the
presence of (combusted) SCRAs
in oral fluid, as this would provide a means to triage noncommunicative
or comatose patients in hospital Emergency Departments. Oral fluid
will however have its own unique FSF that will be convolved with the
SCRA FSF. Figure 6A
shows an example FSF of human oral fluid combined from six different
samples (Figure S5). The oral fluid FSF
(Figure 6A) can be
accurately modeled using eq 1 with two species (Figure 6B), with the resulting residuals plotted in Figure 6C. The resulting
parameters of the fits are given in Table S2. The residuals analysis shows nonlocalization and small variance,
suggesting that fitting the oral fluid FSF with a two species model
is sufficient to accurately model the data. We note that these two
spectral features are present in all of the volunteer samples collected,
so this two species model can perhaps be generalized.

Figure 6 Detecting combusted SCRAs
in oral fluid. (A) FSF of a combined
oral fluid sample from a number of volunteers (individual FSFs shown
in Figure S5). (B) Model of the oral fluid
sample from fitting eq 1 to panel A. (C) Residuals arising from the fit of eq 1 (panel B) to the oral fluid FSF
(panel A). (D–F) FSFs for combusted SCRAs in the presence of
oral fluid (panel D, 5F-ADB; panel E, AM-694; panel F, 5F-PB-22).

Oral fluid is composed of a large number of enzymes
and proteins
and at a relatively high concentration in addition to glycosaminoglycans,
a range of electrolytes, thiocyanate, hydrogen peroxide, and opiorphin.
Moreover, the enzymes/proteins present contain a range of cofactors
including cobalamin, heme, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate)
hydride (NAD(P)H). We anticipate that the fluorescence signal will
be dominated by the aromatic amino acids present in the high concentration
of protein (oral fluid enzymes) present. Indeed, for a range of different
participants’ samples, a similar feature is observed (Figure S5), approximately as one would expect
given the known excitation/emission maxima of tyrosine, phenylalanine,
and tryptophan (λex ∼264 nm; λem ∼352 nm). A second feature is also apparent in the oral fluid
samples (Figure S5 and Figure 6A); λex ∼343
nm, and λem ∼ 413 nm. It is tempting to speculate
that this signal is attributable to (NAD(P)H), which has an absorption
maximum at λmax = ∼340 nm, but clearly this
signal will also be convolved of other cofactors. We note that the
second spectral feature is present at ∼11 ± 5% of the
putative protein signal as assessed from fitting eq 1 to each of the individual oral fluid samples
(Table S1).

To assess if SCRAs can
be detected via their FSF in oral fluid,
we mixed combusted SCRAs (Figure 5D–-F; 5F-ADB, AM-694, and 5F-PB-22) in the presence
of the combined oral fluid sample (Figure 6A) and recorded the resultant FSFs (Figure 6D–F). THC
is found at ∼1 μg mL–1 immediately
after smoking, so the concentration range we used for the SCRAs is
realistic in context.34,35 We note that the oral fluid samples
used were not diluted appreciably on addition of the SCRA; the only
preparation was filtering.

Figure 7 shows the
quantification of the difference between the combusted SCRAs in the
presence and absence of oral fluid. Panels A–C of Figure 7 show a simple subtraction
of the oral fluid FSF (Figure 6A) for each of the combusted SCRAs. From Figure 7A–C we find that the
presence of the SCRA caused the emission attributable to oral fluid
proteins to be heavily quenched (negative purple peak). It seems likely
given the extremely high concentration of protein in human oral fluid
that one could expect significant resonance energy transfer (RET)
to the SCRAs, and this would seem a likely cause of the smaller magnitude
emission arising from the protein signal. Moreover, from Figure 7A–C, the new
emission signals (coral) are SCRA specific. That is, even at the most
simple level of analysis, the different combusted SCRAs show unique
FSFs even in the presence of oral fluid. Panels D and E of Figure 7 show an alternative
analysis where the numerical model of the oral fluid FSF (Figure 6B) is fitted to the
oral fluid SCRA FSF (Figure 6D–F), allowing only the amplitude of each of the two
species in Figure 6B to vary. Panels D and E of Figure 7 are then the plot of the resulting residuals, i.e.,
the features of the FSF that are not captured by the model of oral
fluid alone. This analysis has the advantage that any changes in the
emission intensity of each of the spectral features attributable to
oral fluid are accounted for. Comparing the residuals for each SCRA
(Figure 7D,E) to the
residuals for oral fluid alone (Figure 6C), it is clear that the oral fluid model alone cannot
account for a large proportion of the residuals. Similar to the difference
FSFs shown in Figure 7A–C, these data suggest that the presence of the individual
SCRAs can be disambiguated from oral fluid alone using model fitting.

Figure 7 (A-C)
Difference FSFs for each of the SCRAs shown as the subtraction
of Figure 6A from each
of Figure 6D–F
(panel A, 5F-ADB; panel B, AM-694; panel C, 5F-PB-22). (D–F)
Residuals arising from the fit of the model shown in Figure 6B to each of the SCRA + oral
fluid FSFs shown in Figure 6D–F (panel D, 5F-ADB; panel E, AM-694; panel F, 5F-PB-22).

Comparing the combusted FSFs (Figure 5D–F) to those in the
presence of oral
fluid (Figure 7), some
aspects of the FSF are retained in the presence of oral fluid. However,
the oral fluid + SCRA FSFs do not appear to be a simple superposition
of the combusted SCRAs and oral fluid alone. From Figure 7, 5F-ADB + oral fluid, the
signal attributable to the indazole group is readily apparent and
shifted somewhat compared to the combusted material in solvent (Figure 5D); λex ∼ 314 nm; λem ∼ 376 nm. AM-694 +
oral fluid retains a broad spectral feature at λem ∼ 440 nm and a more defined spectral feature at λem ∼ 385 nm, similar to combusted AM-694 alone (Figure 5E). Finally, 5F-PB-22
shows little to no contribution from the same species present in oral
fluid (Figure 5F);
instead there is a single feature readily apparent at λex ∼ 370 nm and λem ∼450 nm,
potentially reflecting the quinoline of 5F-PB-22. Thus, the indole
emission of the core position is almost entirely quenched, but potentially
the emission of the quinoline in 5F-PB-22 (Figure 2F) is sensitized in oral fluid.

At
a simple level, oral fluid presents a milieu that one would
reasonably expect to affect fluorophore emission through direct collisional
effects, (F)RET between different chromophores, differences in solvent
dielectric, quenching by metal, and pH variation. Therefore, it is
perhaps unsurprising that the SCRA FSFs in oral fluid show a significant
amount of variance from those measured in H2O/MeOH. However,
these data illustrate that each of the combusted SCRAs can be separately
detected in oral fluid and that each of the SCRAs retain a unique,
identifiable FSF. We note that we have attempted detection of SCRAs
in urine; however, we find that the emission attributable to the SCRAs
is entirely quenched, presumably via (F)RET to the extremely high
concentrations of creatinine/uric acid. We would point to the relative
simplicity of the saliva samples we have used to demonstrate SCRA
detection and clearly a major challenge moving forward will be the
addition of other molecules that may give a signal, in terms of both
false -positives and -negatives.

Conclusions
SCRAs
are a heterogeneous group of compounds that show significant
chemical diversity. Our data show that FSFs of these compounds are
unique, owing to a complex interplay between a number of factors including
(i) solvent effects, (ii) substituent effects, (iii) conjugation between
chromophores, and (iv) (F)RET between chromophores. These factors
combine to give rise to the uniqueness of the FSFs. Our data suggest
that the FSF might be able to disambiguate even the factors above
and this would provide an enhanced utility of the FSFs in terms of
structural discrimination. However, we would stress that the FSFs
will be challenging to calculate a priori so the power of the approach
will develop as FSFs for a greater variety of structural classes and
variants are gathered.

SCRA use is almost entirely localized
to prisons and homeless groups.36 SCRAs
can be packaged as essentially pure compounds
or as mixtures of SCRAs, and on a range of matrices. Combined, these
factors make detection and sensing of SCRAs challenging, and there
is a need for new tools to suit specific detection niches. Our work
provides evidence that combined excitation/emission matrices (FSFs)
can discern SCRAs to a high degree of accuracy and against complex
biological backgrounds (oral fluid). These data therefore represent
a clear proof-of-principle that FSFs have potential as an analytical
tool in the detection of SCRAs. The collection of FSFs is simple and
can be easily achieved using a relatively small portable instrument.

The challenges for developing the approach are discrimination of
mixtures that are superimposed on a potentially complex background,
e.g., oral fluid containing other drugs, prescription medication,
and metabolites. We have shown that numerical modeling of FSFs, e.g.,
using eq 1, has the potential
to discriminate individual SCRAs and that also in the presence of
a complex milieu (oral fluid). This suggests that more advanced analyses
such as machine learning could be fruitfully applied to discriminate
the presence of SCRAs. We note that this approach relies on libraries
of data. We stress that our data illustrate the need to build these
libraries for specific detection scenarios, discerning SCRA presence,
e.g., from street material, versus from smoked material in oral fluid.

Given the apparent detection sensitivity of FSFs, we propose that
as we develop this approach, it will find utility in reducing the
number of admissions to hospital for SCRA overdose if used as part
of a community harm reduction strategy. Combined with detection capability
at the point-of-care in hospitals allowing enhanced clinical decision
making, the approach could significantly reduce the costs of SCRA
abuse to health services.
