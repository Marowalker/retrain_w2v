There is a very limited number of
existing probes whose fluorescence
is turned on in the presence of the class of biological thiols made
up of glutathione, cysteine, and homocysteine. The extant probes for
this class of biological thiols commonly have poor aqueous solubility
and long analyte response times, and they demand a very high probe/thiol
ratio for decreased time of significant reporter signal generation;
knowledge regarding their selectivity with respect to other sulfur-based
analytes is unclear. Described here is a previously unreported photoinduced
electron-transfer-quenched probe (HMBQ-Nap 1) that offers
highly selective and rapid in vitro detection of this class of biologically
important thiols at low concentrations and low probe/thiol ratio,
and importantly, very rapid imaging of these biological thiols in
human cells.

==== Body
The need
is great for a diverse
set of probes capable of having their fluorescence signal turned on
by analytes in complex environments, so as to allow for analyte detection,
quantification, and imaging.1 Diversity
is required for both the mechanism of analyte activation of the probe
to reveal its corresponding highly fluorescent reporter, and the energy
range over which the reporter provides a signal of analyte presence.
Ideally, beyond probes whose signal is so selective that determination
of a single target is deemed specific, the library will possess probes
that offer class-selective detection and quantification of analytes
with high figures of merit. The latter is of great value in complicated
analysis scenarios, which often also require rapid and temporally
stable reporting of analyte presence.

Currently, there is a
small group of environmentally stable probes
whose fluorescence is turned on in the complex medium of mammalian
cells only by the collective presence of the biologically
relevant thiol compounds2 glutathione (GSH),
cysteine (Cys), and homocysteine (Hcy).3 These efforts to detect and image intracellularly the presence of
this class of biological thiols have employed turn-on probes that,
for the most part, are poorly soluble in physiologically relevant
media, have long analyte response times, and/or require excessive
amounts of analyte to achieve timely activation of the probe to yield
a measurable reporter signal. Furthermore, the GSH/Cys/Hcy selectivity
of these previously reported probes with regard to presence of H2S or protein thiols is not known, quite poor, or limited4 at best. Thus, due to the crucial role that GSH,
Cys, and Hcy play in biological systems, particularly within cells,
it is important to develop probes that are passively taken up by cells
in a quick fashion; whose fluorescence signal is rapidly turned on
in the presence of these three biological thiols while remaining fluorescently
silent upon exposure to other biologically important analytes, and
whose fluorescence background response in comparison to the signal
of the reporter is exceedingly small (minimal spectral overlap of
probe and reporter absorption/emission) so as to allow for cellular
imaging with high contrast (large signal-to-background ratio).

To that end, we report herein the design, synthesis, and evaluation
of the turn-on probe HMBQ-Nap 1 (Scheme 1). This new probe offers exceedingly rapid (<5 min) and
low-concentration (∼30 nM) detection of GSH, Cys, and Hcy under
physiological conditions, without the need for excessively high probe/analyte
ratios to achieve rapid probe activation or the requirement for large
amounts of organic cosolvent to boost probe solubility. HMBQ-Nap 1 exhibits remarkably good selectivity toward these thiols
in comparison to a protein thiol and the gasotransmitter H2S that is of growing interest to the cell measurement science community.
Importantly, due to its design, HMBQ-Nap 1 is taken up
and activated in a very rapid fashion, so as to offer high-speed imaging
of total intracellular biological thiol content in human cells with
a high signal-to-background ratio.

Scheme 1 Biological Thiol Activation of HMBQ-Nap 1
Experimental Section
Materials
and General Methods
Column purifications
were performed by use of SNAP silica columns on a Flash-master Personal
from Biotage. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich
or Fisher Scientific. Thin-layer chromatography was performed on aluminum-backed
60 F254 silica plates from EMD Chemicals Inc. The 1H NMR
and 13C NMR spectra were collected in CDCl3 or
deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6) at 25 °C on a Bruker AV-400 spectrometer, with chemical shifts
reported in the standard δ notation of parts per million, with
tetramethylsilane as an internal reference. Absorption bands in NMR
spectra are listed as singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t), or multiplet
(m), and the coupling constants J are expressed in
hertz (Hz). Mass spectral analyses were carried out on an Agilent
6210 electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ESI-TOFMS).
All solutions were prepared with Nanopure water from a Barnstead Diamond
Nanopure water System (18 MΩ·cm).

Synthesis
Synthesis
of HMBQ-Nap 1 is as
outlined in Scheme 2. The free Nap 2 reporter, 4-amino-9-(n-butyl)-1,8-naphthalimide,
and compound 3, hydroxymethylbenzoquinone (HMBQ),5 were synthesized according to literature methods.

Scheme 2 Synthetic Route for HMBQ-Nap 1 Probe
To a solution of 2 (36.39 mg, 0.14
mmol) in anhydrous
dichloromethane (DCM) were added 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP; 32.92
mg, 0.27 mmol) and a solution of phosgene (15% toluene, 1 mL) at −10
°C, and the mixture was stirred under argon for 3 h. The excess
phosgene was removed by bubbling argon gas through the solution for
30 min. To this resulting solution was added 3 (70.39
mg, 0.39 mmol), and the solution was stirred at 0 °C for an additional
12 h. The reaction mixture was quenched with water (30 mL) and extracted
with CH2Cl2 (3 × 50 mL). The organic phase
was dried over Na2SO4, subsequently filtered,
and the solvent was evaporated. The crude product was purified by
silica gel flash column chromatography using dichloromethane/ethyl
acetate (10:1 v/v). The final product was obtained as a yellow solid. 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ

Voltammetry
Cyclic
voltammetry was performed in 0.1
M (n-butyl)4NClO4/dry acetonitrile
under anaerobic conditions. A Princeton Applied Research model 273A
potentiostat/galvanostat was used with the Power Suite 2.53 operating
software. Voltammograms were collected at 0.1 V·s–1 at room temperature (25 °C) after the solution was degassed
with nitrogen for 20 min. Glassy-carbon working (BAS, 3 mm diameter),
platinum wire counter, and Ag/AgCl reference (BAS) electrodes were
used, and the potentials were referenced versus ferrocene/ferrocenium
internal standard.

Calculation of Free Energy of Photoinduced
Electron Transfer
To assess the thermodynamic feasibility
of fluorescence quenching
of HMBQ-Nap 1 by oxidative photoinduced electron transfer
(OeT), voltammetric measurements of HMBQ-Nap 1 and its
components were used in conjunction with the Rehm–Weller equation
to calculate the free energy of the PeT process: 1  For the OeT process,
the redox potential (ED) of the donor
Nap 2 and the potential
(EA) of the acceptor HMBQ 3 were determined to be 1.24 and −0.92 V, respectively. ΔG00, the energy of the first excited singlet
state of Nap 2, was found to be 2.67 eV;2e2/εd is the Coulombic interaction energy of the ion pair, known to be
0.06 eV. From these values, the energy change for OeT quenching, ΔGPeT, is calculated to be −0.95 eV, indicating
that electron transfer from the excited Nap 2 to the
electron-poor HMBQ 3 is thermodynamically feasible.

Spectroscopic Methods
All spectroscopic measurements
were performed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer/0.1 M KCl solutions, pH 7.4.
Absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary-50 spectrophotometer,
and fluorescence data were collected on a PerkinElmer LS55 spectrometer.
Samples for absorption and emission measurements were contained in
1 cm × 1 cm quartz cuvettes (3.5 mL volume, Sigma–Aldrich).
Fluorescence quantum yields were determined by reference to coumarin
in EtOH (Φ = 0.54) and quinine sulfate in 1 N H2SO4 (Φ = 0.51).6

Procedure for
Thiol Sensing
A stock solution of HMBQ-Nap 1 (100 μM) was prepared in 100% DMSO and was subsequently
diluted to prepare appropriate concentration solutions of 1 in DMSO/phosphate-buffered saline (10% DMSO/90% 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4).
Thiol stock solutions were freshly prepared prior to each experiment.
For the calibration curve, solutions of HMBQ-Nap 1 were
incubated with different concentrations of thiols at 37 °C for
15 min, and spectral data were recorded. Excitation was at 432 nm
and emission was detected at 540 nm. The excitation and emission slit
widths were set at 2.5 nm.

Cell Culture
H596 (human non-small-cell
lung cancer),
cell culture base medium, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA. Cell culture
was performed as suggested by ATCC. H596 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640
with 10% FBS and 10 IU/mL penicillin–streptomycin. Cells were
incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5 wt
%/vol CO2.

Cell Imaging via Scanning Laser Confocal
Microscopy
H596 cells were cultured overnight in 22 ×
22 mm glass coverslips
on a treated tissue culture 6-well plate purchased from Fisher Scientific.
At that time, the existing growth medium was replaced with 2 mL of
fresh medium and then incubated at 37 °C. Solutions of HMBQ-Nap 1 prepared in DMSO were added to the cells to give a 2 ×
10–5 M solution of HMBQ-Nap 1, with
the DMSO concentration kept constant at <1%. Cells were incubated
with HMBQ-Nap 1 at 37 °C for 10 min and then treated
with 3.0 × 10–6 M DRAQ5 (nuclear stain obtained
from Thermo Scientific) for 1 min. The medium was removed and the
cells were fixed in 2 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min with shaking.
After fixing, the cells were rinsed with Nanopure water, and the coverslips
were mounted to glass slides with Immumount (obtained from Fisher
Scientific). Glass slides were left in the dark overnight to allow
the Immumount to dry. Confocal images were acquired on a Leica TCS
SP2 spectral confocal microscope. For images of cells exposed to HMBQ-Nap 1, samples were excited with the 458 nm line of an Ar/KrAr
laser (laser intensity = 72%), and the spectral emission was collected
(Leica DD458/514, 480–580 nm); photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltage
= 710 V. Likewise, cells exposed to DRAQ5 were excited with the 633
nm line of a HeNe laser (laser intensity = 35%), and the spectral
emission was collected (665–750 nm). All images were collected
via a pinhole of 3.1 Airy units. Images were frame- and line-averaged
four times. Image analysis was performed with ImageJ and Leica LAS
AF lite software. As the control experiment, H596 cells were preincubated
with 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) at 37 °C for
30 min to scavenge all thiols in cells, then the cells were washed
with 0.1 M, pH 7.4 PBS to remove any excess NEM, followed by incubation
with 20 μM HMBQ-Nap 1 prior to their being fixed
as above.

Results and Discussion
Design of Fluorescent Probe
The design rationale of
the PeT (photoinduced electron transfer) quenched fluorescence probe
HMBQ-Nap 1 in Scheme 1 is as follows.
HMBQ-Nap 1 contains 4-amino-9-(n-butyl)-1,8-naphthalimide
(Nap 2) as the reporter unit and hydroxymethylbenzoquinone
(HMBQ) as the oxidative PeT quencher, with the latter also being the
pendant reaction site for biologically relevant thiols. The electronic
properties of the HMBQ trigger group are such that HMBQ (E1/2 = −0.80 V vs standard hydrogen electrode, SHE)
should not be activated by possible interferents in biological milieu,
for example, ascorbate and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NADH). In addition, the carbamate linkage between the HMBQ trigger
group and the Nap 2 reporter was chosen due to its known
stability in biological environments.7 Thus,
upon successful thiol–HMBQ-Nap 1 interaction (Michael
addition that leads to elimination of thiol–HMBQ product and
CO2), a highly intense fluorescence signal is expected
from Nap 2. Furthermore, the charge-neutral HMBQ-Nap 1 should enter cells readily via a passive route, so as to
allow for class-selective reporting of biological thiol presence.

Spectral Properties of Probe/Reporter System
To demonstrate
the off–on nature of the probe 1/reporter 2 system, the fluorescence emission spectra and quantum yields
(Φ) of pure HMBQ-Nap 1 probe and pure Nap 2 reporter were obtained in aqueous medium at physiological
pH (Figure 1). On the basis of its extremely
low-intensity emission spectrum (Figure 1B)
and miniscule quantum yield (Φprobe = 0.003), the
fluorescence of HMBQ-Nap 1 probe is quenched in a highly
effective manner. We attribute this characteristic to HMBQ-Nap 1 being efficiently PeT-quenched, as a result of its design
(electronic properties of the Nap 2 reporter and HMBQ
quencher), with the free energy of the PeT quenching process being
quite favorable, −0.95 eV (eq 1).7 On the contrary, free Nap 2 reporter
is strongly fluorescent, with a quantum yield (Φreporter) of 0.19 in the aqueous medium used here, resulting in a 64-fold
difference in quantum efficiency versus the HMBQ-Nap 1 probe.

Figure 1 (A) Absorbance and (B) fluorescence spectra of 2 μM HMBQ-Nap 1 (gray line) and 2 μM Nap 2 (Green line)
in 10% DMSO/90% 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 at 25
°C. Insets: (A) visual color change and (B) fluorescence emission
change observed for solution of HMBQ-Nap 1 upon addition
of glutathione (GSH).

The absorption maximum of Nap 2 is red-shifted
by
∼70 nm from that of the HMBQ-Nap 1 probe (Figure 1), leading to a ∼4-fold higher molar extinction
coefficient for Nap 2 at its excitation maximum. This
difference in maximum absorption energy is due to the electron-withdrawing
capability of the carbamate linkage between the HMBQ and naphthalimide
groups in probe 1. Upon excitation at the absorption
maximum of Nap 2, the resulting fluorescence emission
intensity for Nap 2 at 540 nm is determined to be 64
times greater than that of HMBQ-Nap 1. The ∼275×
difference in reporter/probe brightness (εΦ) observed
in Figure 1 makes the reporter/probe pair an
excellent candidate for detection and quantification of biological
thiols and in high signal-to-background cellular imaging of biological
thiols.

In Vitro Response and Selectivity of Probe to Biological Thiols
We determined the ability of HMBQ-Nap 1 to act as
a turn-on probe when in the presence of only select biological thiols
by exposing aqueous, buffered solutions of HMBQ-Nap 1 to three physiologically significant nonprotein thiols: GSH, Cys,
and Hcy (Figure 2). Outcomes from both 1H NMR and mass spectrometric studies demonstrate that thiols
undergo Michael addition to HMBQ-Nap 1 in aqueous media
to unleash Nap 2 reporter and quinone methide products
(Figures S2 and S3 in Supporting Information); there is no indication of redox activation of HMBQ-Nap 1, as noted by the absence of spectroscopic signatures for reduced
HMBQ (hydroquinone). Buffered, aqueous solutions of HMBQ-Nap 1 exhibited an exceedingly rapid increase in fluorescence
during their incubation with GSH, Cys, and Hcy, and the rate of fluorescence
increase was a function of biological thiol/HMBQ-Nap 1 ratio. Upon evaluation of plots of the fluorescence intensity versus
each biological thiol concentration, it was found that there exists
an apparent linear relationship for biothiol concentrations up to
2 μM (Figure S4, Supporting Information). From these calibration curves, it was determined that the concentration
limits of detection for GSH, Hcy, and Cys are 33, 21, and 29 nM, respectively;
the concentration limits of quantification are 110, 70, and 98 nM.8 The rapid nature of the turn-on process is evidenced
by the ∼150 s time required to reach 90% of the maximum attainable
signal for each of the nonprotein thiols GSH, Hcy, and Cys. This rapid rate of turn-on is unprecedented for a probe system that
is able to efficiently generate reporter signal at such low probe/thiol
ratios (substoichiometric, see Figure S4 in Supporting Information; see also Table S1 for comparison to
other systems). As expected for this group of biological thiols (similar
thiol pKa value)9 and the HMBQ trigger group,10 there is
no significant difference in fluorescence signal profile. At this
time, it is not known why the maximum achievable signal plateau is
larger for GSH versus Cys and Hcy.

Figure 2 Time-dependent fluorescence (λex = 432 nm, λem = 540 nm) from 10 μM
HMBQ-Nap 1 incubated
with 50 μM thiol-containing analyte in 0.1 M PBS/DMSO (9:1),
pH 7.4 at 25 °C. Fluorescence signals were compared to that from
a 10 μM solution of Nap 2. Stability of 10 μM
Nap 2 with 1 mM GSH is demonstrated by the red line.

The potential sulfur-based, cross-reactive
species H2S and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were chosen
for initial evaluation
of HMBQ-Nap 1 selectivity. H2S, or more appropriately
HS– at physiological pH, has become an increasingly
studied species in cells due to its link to cellular signaling pathways
and a variety of inflammatory-associated diseases.11 Although its cellular concentration (nanomolar) is estimated
to be dwarfed by that of the more abundant biological thiols,11 H2S could possibly be an interferent
because of the potential for it to undergo Michael addition to,12 or cause reduction of, the HMBQ group. In addition,
the protein content is roughly 20–25 wt % inside cells, with
many of those proteins possessing free thiol groups.13 Furthermore, over 90% of the extracellular thiols in blood
are due to the presence of the most abundant protein (∼60%),
serum albumin.14 Human serum albumin (HSA),
like BSA, has only one free thiol (Cys 34);15 this is a potential site of reaction with HMBQ-Nap 1. BSA was chosen for study here due to the known variability in the
free thiol content of Cys 34 in HSA upon its storage.15

From the kinetic studies in Figure 2, it
is found that in stark contrast to the rapid reaction of HMBQ-Nap 1 with GSH, Cys, and Hcy, an exceedingly sluggish response
is observed for probe 1 in the presence of H2S and BSA under equivalent conditions. At 150 s, the signal from
GSH is 103-fold higher than that from H2S and 17 times
greater than for BSA. However, we have found that the fluorescence
quantum yield of Nap 2 is roughly 25% higher in the presence
of 50 μM BSA (conditions in Figure 2),
possibly due to viscosity and hydrophobic interaction effects; thus,
the selectivity of HMBQ-Nap 1 activation by GSH, Cys,
or Hcy versus BSA is certainly higher. The slow reaction of the thiol
(Cys 34) in BSA with HMBQ-Nap 1 can be attributed to
it being sterically hindered, as the thiol of Cys 34 is oriented toward
the interior of the protein,16 an observation
that is consistent with the slow reactivity of Cys 34 in HSA with
Ellman’s reagent [5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)].17 We posit that the low reactivity of H2S with HMBQ-Nap 1 is due to the lack of either HMBQ
reduction by H2S or its Michael addition to HMBQ. The reduction
potential of HMBQ in probe 1 is −0.80 V versus
SHE in comparison to 0.17 V18 for H2S, and successful Michael addition of H2S requires
a very electron-deficient acceptor.12,19

To further
delineate the selectivity of HMBQ-Nap 1 activation by
GSH, Cys, and Hcy, we examined probe stability under
physiological solution conditions in the presence of select amino
acids and reducing agents that may activate HMBQ-Nap 1 and yield Nap 2 reporter. Upon inspection of Figure 3, it is clear that the three thiol-free amino acids
(1 mM, 100 equiv) with the potential to undergo Michael addition to
the HMBQ unit do not interact with HMBQ-Nap 1. Furthermore,
the biological reductants NADH (E1/2 =
−0.31 V)20—present at millimolar
levels within cells—and the ubiquitous ascorbic acid (E1/2 = 0.051 vs SHE)21 also did not induce the release of Nap 2 from HMBQ-Nap 1. The lack of redox-induced activation of HMBQ-Nap 1 by these species is in agreement with the observations above
with H2S, as the reduction potentials of these possible
interferents are not sufficient to allow reduction of the HMBQ unit
in probe 1 (−0.80 V vs SHE).

Figure 3 Fluorescence response
of HMBQ-Nap 1 (10 μM)
incubated at 25 °C for 30 min with 1 mM amino acids and common
reductants in 10% DMSO/90% 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4. Bars represent percent
release of free Nap 2 reporter with respect to that achieved
for HMBQ-Nap 1 incubated with GSH for 30 min.

The temporal integrity of the fluorescence signal
generated by
production of Nap 2 reporter was investigated so as to
test for possible biological thiol-induced structural alterations
of the Nap 2 reporter. It was found that the fluorescence
intensity of Nap 2 was invariant when the reporter was
treated with 100 equiv of GSH (1 mM, Figure 2, red line) for up to 2000 s of incubation, the maximum time tested.

Imaging of Biological Thiol Presence in Human Cells
Upon
demonstration that HMBQ-Nap 1 allows for class-selective
detection of GSH, Cys, and Hcy under low probe/analyte conditions,
an investigation was undertaken to examine the ability of HMBQ-Nap 1 to act as a an imaging agent for the presence of these biological
thiols in human cells. The ability of HMBQ-Nap to detect thiols in
live cells was evaluated using the human lung cancer cell line H596,
which is known to have a GSH content of 140 ± 70 nmol·(mg
of protein)−1.22 Two-dimensional
cell cultures were incubated with 20 μM HMBQ-Nap 1 for 10 min at 37 °C and subsequently washed with 0.1 M PBS,
pH 7.4, and then the cells were fixed with formaldehyde. As the negative-control/background
experiment, H596 cells were preincubated with 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) at 37 °C for 30 min to scavenge thiols
in the cells, and then the cells were washed with 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4,
to remove excess NEM, followed by incubation with 20 μM HMBQ-Nap 1 for 10 min prior to their being fixed as above. Fluorescence
images were obtained by confocal laser microscopy via excitation at
458 nm and detection at 458–514/514–680 nm, with integrated
cellular fluorescence intensity being obtained via software.

Unadulterated H596 cells that were exposed to HMBQ-Nap 1 exhibited strong fluorescence (Figure 4,
without NEM), whereas there was no apparent fluorescence in the negative
control cells that were pretreated with thiol scavenger (Figure 4, with NEM). A signal-to-background ratio of 4.2
was obtained upon comparison of the integrated fluorescence intensities
for the untreated and NEM-treated cells (13 and 17 sample replicates,
respectively); to the best of our knowledge, the work here is the
first report of this analytical figure of merit for biological thiol
imaging in cells. Thus, electrically neutral HMBQ-Nap 1 is able to enter cells and report on the presence of intracellular
biological thiols in a rapid and selective fashion (10 min).

Conclusions
We
have designed, synthesized, and made viable a new dual quenching/trigger
group-based probe whose PeT-quenched fluorescence signal is turned
on selectively upon rapid reaction of probe trigger group with biologically
important thiols so as to cause probe shedding of the thiol-activated
trigger group. The probe HMBQ-Nap 1 exhibits high selectivity
and rapid response toward the three biological thiols glutathione,
cysteine, and homocysteine, when compared to protein-associated thiol
or the simple gasotransmitter H2S, as well as other potential
interferents commonly found in mammalian systems. Rapid activation
of HMBQ-Nap 1 by thiols to yield the highly fluorescent
reporter Nap 2 is attributed to thiol-addition-initiated
elimination of the trigger group. Furthermore, it has been successfully
demonstrated that HMBQ-Nap 1 can provide such rapid and
selective thiol detection in human cells, and with an exceedingly
low limit of detection under in vitro conditions where there is no
need for excessive amounts of probe 1, unlike previously
reported probes that require probe/thiol ratios of 70:1 to 5000:1.3a Thus, HMBQ-Nap 1 diversifies the
pool of biological thiol probes by offering rapid, class-selective
detection and quantification with high figures of merit.
