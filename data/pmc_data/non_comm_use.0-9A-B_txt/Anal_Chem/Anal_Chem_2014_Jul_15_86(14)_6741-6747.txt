The
applicability of gel-based proteomic strategies in phosphoproteomics
has been largely limited by the lack of technologies for specific
detection of phosphoproteins in gels. Here for the first time we report
a strategy for simultaneous visualization and identification of phosphoproteome
in gels (VIPing) through coupling specific detection of phosphoproteins
with protein identification and phosphorylation site mapping by tandem
mass spectrometry. The core of the strategy is a novel compound multifunctionalized
with a titanium ion(IV) for outstanding selectivity toward phosphorylated
residues, a fluorophore for visualization, and a biotin group for
phosphopeptide enrichment. The sensitivity and specificity of the
VIPing strategy was demonstrated using standard protein mixtures and
complex cell extracts, and the method was applied to study the phosphorylation
changes of an essential tyrosine kinase Syk and interacting proteins
upon B-cell stimulation. The novel technique provides a powerful platform
for gel-based phosphoproteomic studies.

==== Body
Gel-based
proteomic strategies,
which often combine protein separation by one- or two-dimensional
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1D or 2D-PAGE) with protein identification
by mass spectrometry (MS), pioneered the field of proteomics and used
to be the workhorse in proteomic studies.1−3 However, for
the past decade, gel-free shotgun proteomics has become the major
strategy for in-depth proteomic analyses. Thousands or even tens of
thousands of proteins can be sequenced, frequently through multidimensional
separation followed by mass spectrometric analysis. Large-scale studies
on protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphorylation
are typically carried out by shotgun proteomics nowadays. Phosphoproteomics
frequently requires extensive fractionation, phosphopeptide enrichment
of each fraction, major instrument commitment, and integration of
large data sets, even for a signaling event that may result in changes
only in a few phosphoproteins, which becomes cost prohibitive for
many researchers.

Here we revisit the gel-based strategy that
may present cost-effective
alternatives to gel-free large-scale phosphoproteomics. Gel-based
analyses allow us to first visualize proteins in the gel and then
only choose relevant proteins for in-gel digestion and mass spectrometric
analysis. There have been several attempts to stain phosphoproteins
in 1D and 2D gels,4−6 such as Diamond ProQ7,8 and PhosTag,9 but highly abundant nonphosphorylated proteins
can also be stained in previous studies.3 Besides the lack of a more specific reagent to detect phosphoproteins
in the gel as the major limitation of gel-based applications in phosphoproteomics,
the finding of actual phosphopeptides is typically required to confidently
identify a phosphoprotein. Because of the relatively low stoichiometric
nature and ionization efficiency of phosphopeptides in mass spectrometric
analysis, an efficient enrichment step is strongly recommended in
phosphoproteomic studies. The most common enriching strategies are
based on metal ion affinities to capture peptides containing negatively
charged phosphate groups, such as immobilized metal affinity chromatography
(IMAC), metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC),10,11 and polymer-based metal ion affinity capture (PolyMAC).12 Among the many metal ions employed, titanium
ion (IV) has been demonstrated to be of superior specificity for phosphate
groups.13

Here we devise a multifunctionalized
molecule, termed visualization
and identification of phosphoproteins in gels (VIPing), that combines
gel-based phosphoprotein detection in high specificity with efficient
phosphopeptide enrichment. Each VIPing molecule consists of a titanium
ion for selective binding to phosphorylated residues, a fluorophore
for visualization, and a biotin group to isolate phosphopeptides.
The capability of the VIPing reagent was demonstrated with standard
protein mixtures and complex samples by specifically staining phosphoproteins
in gels and capturing phosphopeptides after in-gel digestion. The
VIPing method was applied to study the phosphorylation changes of
an essential tyrosine kinase Syk (spleen tyrosine kinase) and its
interacting proteins upon B-cell stimulation.

are included in the Supporting Information.

Phosphoprotein Detection and Phosphopeptide Enrichment by VIPing
Protein mixtures, such as the standard protein mixture (bovine
serum albumin (BSA), ovalbumin, β-casein, β-lactoglobulin), Escherichia coli lysate, and proteins immunoprecipitated
from DT-40 cell lysates, were separated on a precast SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen
NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels) at 180 V/gel at room temperature. Fixation was
accomplished by treating the gels with 50% MeOH/10% AcOH twice, for
30 min and overnight, respectively. The SDS-PAGE was then soaked in
ddH2O (three times, 10 min each) and incubated for 1 h
with 1 μM of the VIPing reagent in 10 mL of 500 mM glycolic
acid/1% TFA solution, pH 0.75. The gel was washed four times with
15 mL of 500 mM glycolic acid/1% TFA/20% CH3CN solution
for 30 min each wash and then twice with ultrapure water at room temperature
for 5 min each wash. For detection, the gel was visualized using Typhoon
FLA 9500 at an excitation source of 532 nm and emission filter of
580 nm. Sypro Ruby staining for total protein detection was performed
on the same gel by following the product procedure. In-gel digestion
with trypsin was conducted according to the method described by Mathris.14 Tryptic peptides were extracted from the gel.
The extraction was dried completely in SpeedVac. The peptide mixture
was redissolved in 100 μL of 100 mM glycolic acid/1% TFA/50%
CH3CN. Another 1.4 pmol of VIPing was supplemented to the
peptide mixture and incubated for 5 min. A volume of 200 μL
of 300 mM HEPES (pH 7.7) was added to adjust to a final pH of 6.3.
The solution was then transferred into a spin column with filter containing
10 μL of streptavidin beads (high capacity streptavidin agarose
from Pierce). The spin column was gently agitated for an additional
30 min. The supernatant was removed from the spin column by centrifugation
at 2000g for 30 s. The beads were then washed three
times with 200 μL of 100 mM HOAc/80% CH3CN for 5
min each. The peptides captured were eluted by incubation of the beads
twice with 100 μL of 400 mM ammonium hydroxide solution for
5 min each. The eluates were collected and dried down completely under
vacuum.

Phosphoprotein Dephosphorylation
For protein dephosphorylation,
the protein mixture was incubated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase
(CIAP) in 1× CIAP buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol) for 12 h at 37 °C. To stop the
enzyme activity, the samples were boiled for 5 min in 1× SDS
sample buffer.

Cell Culture
E. coli cells (strain:
BL21) were grown in 250 mL of Luria–Bertani (LB) medium under
vigorous shaking. At OD600 = 1.0, the cells were precipitated by centrifugation
(10 min at 5000g) and resuspended in lysis solution
(50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 1×
protease inhibitor cocktail) for 20 min on ice. Cells were lysed in
lysis solution. Cells debris was cleared at 14 000g for 10 min. Supernatant containing soluble proteins was collected.
The protein concentration of the cell lysate was determined using
the Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay.

Syk Complex Preparation
DT-40 cells that express Syk-EGFP
were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum,
1% chicken serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin.
Cells (1 × 1E7 cells/mL) were stimulated with pervanadate treatment
(freshly made 0.1 M H2O2 and 0.1 M Na3VO4 and incubated for 10–20 min before use). The
stimulation reactions were stopped by washing with ice-cold PBS buffer.
Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl,
1% NP-40, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1× phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail (Sigma), 1× protease inhibitor cocktail, 10 mM sodium
fluoride). The protein concentration of the cell lysate was determined
using the Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay. A volume of 20 μL
(50% slurry) of GFP nanotrap agarose resin (Chromotek) was added to
10 mg of protein mixture and incubated overnight with end-to-end rotation
at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads/protein complex was washed
three times with lysis buffer and once with H2O. The bound
proteins were eluted by boiling in 2× SDS solution containing
40 mM DTT for 5 min at 95 °C. The resulting samples (including
the set-aside lysates) were run on an SDS-PAGE gel.

LC–MS/MS
Analysis
The dried peptides were resuspended
in 10 μL of 0.5% formic acid and injected into an Eksigent 2D
Ultra nanoflow HPLC system. The reverse phase C18 was performed using
an in-house C18 capillary column packed with 5 μm C18 Magic
beads resin (Michrom; 75 μm i.d. and 30 cm of bed length). The
mobile phase buffer consisted of 0.1% formic acid in ultrapure water
with the eluting buffer of 100% CH3CN run over a shallow
linear gradient over 20 min with a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The electrospray
ionization emitter tip was generated on the prepacked column with
a laser puller (model P-2000, Sutter Instrument Co.). The Eksigent
Ultra HPLC system was coupled online with a high-resolution hybrid
linear ion trap Orbitrap mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap Velos; Thermo
Fisher). The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent
mode in which a full-scan MS (from m/z 300–2000 with the resolution of 30 000) was followed
by 20 MS/MS scans of the most abundant ions. Ions with charge state
of 1+ were excluded. The mass exclusion time was 90 s. The LTQ-Orbitrap
raw files were searched directly against database Gallus gallus with Syk Mus musculus (P48025) sequence (17 620
entries, obtained from www.uniprot.org) or Bos
taurus (23 850 entries, obtained from www.uniprot.org) using a combination of SEQUEST algorithm and MASCOT on Proteome
Discoverer (version 1.4; Thermo Fisher). Peptide precursor mass tolerance
was set at 10 ppm, and MS/MS tolerance was set at 0.8 Da. Search criteria
included a static modification of cysteine residues of + 57.0214 Da
and a variable modification of + 15.9949 Da to include potential oxidation
of methionine, and a modification of + 79.996 Da on serine, threonine,
or tyrosine for the identification of phosphorylation. Searches were
performed with full tryptic digestion and allowed a maximum of two
missed cleavages on the peptides analyzed from the sequence database.
False discovery rates (FDR) were set below 1% for each analysis. Proteome
Discoverer generates a reverse “decoy” database from
the same protein database, and any peptides passing the initial filtering
parameters that were derived from this decoy database are defined
as false positive identification. Phosphorylation site localization
from CID mass spectra was determined by PhosphoRS scores.15 For phosphopeptides with ambiguous phosphorylation
sites, only one phosphorylation site with the highest score was selected
for further data interpretation.

Results and Discussion
Design
of VIPing Strategy
Our lab previously used a
hyper-branched dendrimer-based bifunctional reagent, pIMAGO, containing
biotin (bound with avidin-HRP for visualization) and phosphonate groups
(for titanium ion chelation) to detect phosphoproteins on a membrane
and in a 96-well plate.16,17 We also devised a similar
reagent, PolyMAC, containing aldehyde and phosphonate groups to allow
for enriching phosphopeptides.12 Both reagents,
taking advantage of the stable titanium(IV) ion–phosphonate
complex, demonstrated high specificity for the phosphate group. Unfortunately
the dendrimer-based reagents are too big to be applied for in-gel
analyses. We reason that trifunctional small molecules bind to phosphate
groups on a phosphoprotein in the gel for in-gel detection and may
be concurrently used for phosphopeptide enrichment after protein digestion
prior to mass spectrometric analysis.

We devised a gel-compatible
reagent, VIPing, which incorporates three independent functionalities:
a titanium ion for highly selective binding to phosphate group, a
fluorophore such as TAMRA for fluorescence-based detection, and a
biotin group for phosphopeptide purification via solid-phase capture
(Figure 1A). The VIPing reagent was prepared
through solid-phase syntheses. Briefly, two lysine building blocks,
Fmoc-Lys(Dde)–OH and Fmoc-Lys(Biotin)–OH were conjugated
with rink beads consequently to form a compound with one biotin group
and two orthogonal protected amine groups. After deprotection, the
amine groups were reacted with TAMRA and i-Pro protected
phosphonate groups separately. The product was cleaved from resin
by acid cleaving, followed by removal of i-Pro groups
with TMSBr. In the last step, the compound was functionalized with
TiOCl2 to generate the VIPing reagent.

Figure 1 (A) Structure of VIPing
reagent. VIPing consists of a titanium
ion for selective binding to phosphate groups, a TAMRA for fluorescence-based
detection and a biotin group for phosphopeptide purification via solid-phase
capture. (B) Experimental workflow for VIPing strategy. After proteins
are separated by SDS-PAGE, phosphorylated proteins are stained with
VIPing reagent and then visualized with a fluorescence imager (Ex/Em
= 532 nm/580 nm). The phosphorylated proteins of interest are excised
in the gel and digested with trypsin. The phosphorylated tryptic peptides
bound to the VIPing reagent are isolated via streptavidin beads followed
by mass spectrometric analysis to identify the proteins and their
phosphorylation sites.

The VIPing reagent is applied to the gel after SDS-PAGE separation
to stain phosphoproteins and visualize with a fluorescence imager
(Ex/Em = 532 nm/580 nm). The total protein detection, such as Sypro
Ruby and Coomassie Blue, can be performed on the same gel for multiplexing
as previously described.18 The phosphorylated
proteins of interest are excised in the gel and digested with trypsin.
The tryptic phosphopeptides bound to the VIPing reagent are isolated
via streptavidin beads followed by mass spectrometric analysis to
identify the proteins and their phosphorylation sites (Figure 1B).

Selectivity and Sensitivity of VIPing-Based
Detection
To initially investigate the ability of VIPing
to selectively detect
phosphorylated proteins in SDS-PAGE, we performed a gel staining of
a five-protein mixture consisting of two standard phosphorylated (β-casein
and ovalbumin) and three nonphosphorylated (BSA, catalase, and β-lactoglobulin)
proteins. Five proteins of 500 ng each were mixed and separated by
SDS-PAGE. Then the protein gel was incubated with the VIPing reagent
and detected by a fluorescence imaging system. As shown in Figure 2A, only the two phosphoproteins (β-casein
and ovalbumin) were stained in the protein gel, indicating good selectivity
of VIPing toward phosphoproteins. Also as expected, the signal from
β-casein appeared much stronger than that from ovalbumin, due
to the relatively larger number of phosphorylated residues present
in β-casein. The signals were no longer detectable after the
proteins were treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (CIAP).
For comparison, the proteins were also detected by Sypro Ruby (a fluorescent
dye for protein gel staining) subsequently on the same gel, as shown
in Figure 2B. To further demonstrate the selectivity
and sensitivity of VIPing-based phosphoprotein detection, the same
five-protein mixture in different amounts, ranging from 7.85 ng to
250 ng were run in SDS-PAGE. The gel staining results (Figure 2C) indicated high specificity and sensitivity, allowing
the detection of as low as 15 ng of β-casein. A comparison with
Sypro Ruby staining (Figure 2D) indicates that
VIPing has equivalent sensitivity to other fluorescence-based methods.

and two phosphorylated proteins (ovalbumin and β-casein). (A)

protein detection of different amounts of the five-protein mixture

Next step, we explored the ability of VIPing to detect endogenous
phosphorylated proteins in a whole cell extract of E. coli BL21 strain (Figure 3). The whole cell extract
was also treated with CIAP. The CIAP-treated samples were equally
divided and one was spiked with standard phosphoproteins, β-casein
and ovalbumin. As shown in Figure 3A, VIPing
was able to stain phosphoproteins in E. coli cell
extract (Lane 1). The signals were due to protein phosphorylation
since all signals disappeared when cell extract was treated with CIAP
(Lane 2). Moreover, phosphoproteins β-casein and ovalbumin were
clearly detected when spiking the five-protein mixture into CIAP-treated E. coli cell extract (Lane 3). Protein gel staining with
Sypro Ruby indicates equal cell extract loading (Figure 3B).

Capture of Phosphopeptides
from α-Casein with VIPing Strategy
Further, to investigate
the ability of the VIPing reagent to enrich
phosphopeptides, a similar standard containing phosphoprotein α-casein
(mixture of isomers α-S1-casein and α-S2-casein) was applied
to SDS-PAGE and visualized by VIPing. Following standard in-gel digestion,
the phosphorylated peptides from α-casein bound to the VIPing
reagent were isolated using solid-phase streptavidin beads and subjected
to LC–MS/MS analysis. We also evaluated the capture efficiency
of VIPing by streptavidin agarose beads. Using fluorescence detection,
we were able to quantify the VIPing reagent present in the flow-through
after solid phase capture. Only 2.22% of VIPing molecule was detected
in the flow-through after streptavidin agarose capture, while more
than 97% of VIPing molecule was successfully captured. In addition,
less than 0.4% of VIPing reagent was found to be dissociated from
streptavidin agarose during washing steps. More importantly, most
phosphorylated peptides from α-S1-casein and α-S2-casein
were identified by mass spectrometry (Table 1), demonstrating the capability of VIPing-based enrichment of phosphopeptides.

Detection of Endogenous
Phosphorylation of Syk-Interacting Proteins
Finally, we applied
the VIPing method to study the phosphorylation
changes of an essential tyrosine kinase Syk and its interacting proteins
that were coimmunoprecipitated from DT-40 chicken B cells upon pervanadate
treatment. Syk is a nonreceptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase and plays
a key role in mediating important cellular activities such as cell
adhesion, innate immune recognition, osteoclast maturation, platelet
activation, and vascular development.19,20 Moreover,
Syk can function as a tumor promoter in hematopoietic malignancies
and at the same time as a tumor suppressor in highly metastatic breast
cancer and melanoma cells.21 The stimulation
of Syk leads to its autophosphorylation and increases its enzymatic
activities, which in turn triggers a series of downstream phosphorylation
events such as nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathways
and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) mediated Tec family and Akt signaling
pathways.

In this study, we employed DT-40 chicken B cells that
express an exogenous Syk (Mus musculus) tagged with
enhanced green fluorescent protein (Syk-EGFP) and treated the cells
with pervanadate. Pervanadate is an irreversible protein-tyrosine
phosphatase inhibitor and is known to enhance Syk phosphorylation
in cells. To study phosphorylation changes of Syk and its interacting
proteins upon pervanadate treatment, Syk-EGFP protein complex coimmunoprecipitated
from DT-40 cells was subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, followed by phosphoprotein
gel staining using the VIPing reagent. After detection, phosphoproteins
with significant phosphorylation changes were in-gel digested and
analyzed with LC–MS/MS.

An anti-EGFP Western Blotting
was carried out as the sample loading
control (Figure 4A). As shown in Figure 4B, the VIPing gel staining result indicates that
the phosphorylation levels of both Syk and interacting proteins increased
dramatically upon treatment. In parallel, the protein complex was
also detected by an antiphosphotyrosine antibody, showing similarly
increasing phosphorylation pattern for tyrosine phosphorylation (Figure 4C). All these data suggested the higher phosphorylation
levels of Syk-EGFP and interacting proteins upon stimulation.

pervanadate stimulation. (A) Chemiluminescent HRP-anti-EGFP antibody

HRP-anti-pTyr antibody detection.

We selected six bands (marked in Figure 4B) that showed higher phosphorylation signals upon stimulation
and
carried out in-gel digestion, phosphopeptide enrichment by VIPing
and analysis by LC–MS/MS. We identified a total of 14 unique
phosphopeptides with 16 phosphorylation sites, representing 12 phosphorylated
proteins, including Syk and several known Syk interacting proteins
(Table 2). Among the 16 phosphorylation sites,
two phosphorylation sites from Syk (Mus musculus)
have been reported including Tyr 520, which is one of the known Syk
autophosphorylation sites.22 Nine phosphorylation
sites from Syk-interacting proteins have also been reported on their
corresponding Homo sapiens homologues; the other
five phosphorylation sites are novel. All 12 identified proteins’ Homo sapiens homologues are also known phosphoproteins.
In addition, the molecular weights of the 12 identified phosphorylated
proteins are consistent with their band positions in the gel. Therefore,
the results indicated that the VIPing strategy is particularly appealing
to detect novel phosphorylation events and characterize phosphorylation
sites on endogenous proteins under different conditions without comprehensive
phosphoproteomic analyses.

Conclusion
In summary, a novel technique that combines specific phosphoprotein
detection in gels with phosphopeptide enrichment for confident identification
of phosphoproteins was presented here. The VIPing strategy is highly
specific for phosphoprotein visualization in SDS-PAGE, efficient for
phosphopeptide enrichment, and compatible with mass spectrometric
analysis. The technique can detect global changes in phosphorylation
and is able to facilitate the identification of novel phosphorylated
proteins and phosphorylation sites. The technology can be applied
to detect phosphoproteome on the gel and then selectively identify
phosphoproteins that are only relevant in a biological event. The
technology allows multiplexed detection of phosphorylation and protein
expression on the same gel when combined with total protein staining.
The new strategy has the potential to be a major analytical tool for
targeted phosphoproteomic studies.
