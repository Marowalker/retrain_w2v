Iontophoresis
uses a current to eject solution from the tip of
a barrel formed from a pulled glass capillary and has been employed
as a method of drug delivery for neurochemical investigations. Much
attention has been devoted to resolving perhaps the greatest limitation
of iontophoresis, the inability to determine the concentration of
substances delivered by ejections. To further address this issue,
we evaluate the properties of typical ejections such as barrel solution
velocity and its relation to the ejection current using an amperometric
and liquid chromatographic approach. These properties were used to
predict the concentration distribution of ejected solute that was
then confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. Additionally, incorporation
of oppositely charged fluorophores into the barrel investigated the
role of migration on the mass transport of an ejected species. Results
indicate that location relative to the barrel tip is the primary influence
on the distribution of ejected species. At short distances (<100
μm), advection from electroosmotic transport of the barrel solution
may significantly contribute to the distribution, but this effect
can be minimized through the use of low to moderate ejection currents.
However, as the distance from the source increases (>100 μm),
even solute ejected using high currents exhibits diffusion-limited
behavior. Lastly a time-dependent theoretical model was constructed
and is used with experimental fluorescent profiles to demonstrate
how iontophoresis can generate near-uniform concentration distributions
near the ejection source.

==== Body
Iontophoresis
is a drug delivery
mechanism that uses a controlled current to eject solute from the
tip of a pulled glass capillary. It was first utilized as a method
to administer acetylcholine at a neuromuscular junction and was eventually
adopted for a similar purpose at synaptic sites.1,2 This
technique has proved beneficial for applications in neuroscience as
it provides several distinct advantages over more traditional methods
of drug delivery, including local and rapid application, bypassing
of the blood brain barrier, and avoiding interference with the behavior
of animals.3−6

Iontophoresis has proved useful in modern studies as a tool
to
investigate a host of neurological properties such as receptor dynamics
and location.7−10 Despite its advantages, more widespread adoption of iontophoresis
has been limited due to the inability to monitor and quantify ejections.5,11,12 This has been partially addressed
through various measurement strategies including electrochemical,
radiometric, and fluorescent techniques.13−16 Notably the addition of a carbon
fiber to an adjacent barrel on the iontophoresis probe allows for
the electrochemical detection of an electroactive solute while also
providing an estimate of the ejection quantity.17−19 However, obtaining
precise drug concentrations from iontophoretic ejections remains difficult.9

While much of the attention regarding the
quantification of iontophoresis
has focused on ejection amount, the spatial distribution of ejected
solute plays an equally important role on establishing the concentration
of a delivered species. In contrast to pressure-based ejections, the
electric field induced by the ejection current has been posited to
facilitate electroosmosis in the tissue surrounding the ejection point.20,21 However, this view is not shared by some who argue that the current
density outside the barrel is too low to significantly contribute
to mass transport.22 In either case, the
velocity of the ejected barrel solution may also be sufficient to
displace previously delivered solute, adding an advective component
to the mass transport. This is made possible by the presence of electroosmosis
within the barrel, resulting in the transport of bulk solution from
the tip.16,23,24 Migration
of charged ions within the barrel can also play an important role
on the ejection rate.25 However, a drop
in the current density outside the barrel also raises questions regarding
the influence of charge on the mass transport of ions following ejection.

In this study we establish the velocity range for iontophoretic
ejections from barrels formed from micropipets and use these values
to predict how advection affects the distribution of an ejected species.
Concentration distributions are derived from steady state fluorescence
measurements and were compared with the theoretical predications.
Additionally, the effect of migration on the solute distribution was
examined by comparing fluorescence intensity profiles of oppositely
charged fluorophores. Finally, we constructed a simple model to approximate
the concentration during and following an iontophoretic ejection.
This model was used with experimental measurements to aid in the design
of more effective protocols for iontophoretic experiments.

Theory
To predict the distribution of substances ejected by iontophoresis
from micropipets, we used a mathematical model to describe this process
once steady state had been achieved. We assumed the ejected species
is a neutral substance transported by convection and diffusion only.
The source was assumed to be a sphere of radius a, and mass transport was considered to be spherically symmetric,
with r as the radial coordinate and the origin at
the center of the sphere. Lastly, the concentration was presumed to
go to zero at distances far from the source. The differential equation
to be evaluated is 1  where J is the flux of the
ejected species, C is its concentration, v is the radial velocity of the solution, and D is the diffusion coefficient. We define V as the
volume flow rate from the barrel which gives 2  

We only consider the solution at steady state requiring evaluation
of 3  

Introducing the dimensionless distance ρ (ρ = r/a), this can be written using the Peclet
number in a similar manner to Weber and co-workers:21 4  where the Peclet number (Pe) is a dimensionless value, which for the present work is given by 5  This equation was solved previously
using
the boundary conditions that C(ρ → ∞)
= 0 and J(ρ = 1) are constant. The solution
is then 6  where the flux at the boundary
of the sphere, J0, can be described by 7  where Cint is
the concentration of the ejected substance in the interior of the
barrel. Substitution of this value into the previous equation yields 8  

At small values of Pe (mass transport dominated
by diffusion) this relationship collapses to 9  that can be rewritten as 10  

This equation reveals that, with Pe ≪1,
normalized concentration responses should superimpose and have shapes
that are independent of a and are linear with 1/r.

Experimental Section
Chemicals and Solutions
All chemicals were used as
received from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise noted.
Artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF) was prepared with 126 mM NaCl,
2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 2.4 mM CaCl2, and 11 mM glucose
in deionized water with the pH adjusted to 7.4 using HCl. Fluorophore
stock solutions were 10 mM for disodium fluorescein, tris(2,2′-bipyridyl)dichlororuthenium(II)
(Ru(bpy)3Cl2), and rhodamine B, all in 5 mM
NaCl. The stock of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (coumarin 120) was a saturated
solution that was prepared by stirring with low heat for 20 min, resulting
in a concentration near the solubility limit (low millimolar).26 Before addition to the iontophoresis barrel,
all stock solutions were diluted 1:1 with 5 mM NaCl and filtered using
a 0.20 μm PTFE filter (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA).

Iontophoretic
Ejections
Iontophoresis probes were fabricated
from four-barreled prefused glass (Friedrich & Dimmock, Millville,
NJ) as previously described.8,23 One barrel contained
a carbon fiber for electrochemical measurements. To minimize natural
convection during imaging, iontophoretic ejections were made into
a 1% (wt/vol) agarose block (Promega, Madison, WI) prepared with aCSF.
Low percentage agarose was used to minimize its hydraulic permeability.27 The agarose (∼2 cm thickness) was placed
on a glass coverslip inside a rectangular barrier of Vaseline which
contained aCSF. A Ag/AgCl pellet reference (World Precision Instruments,
Sarasota, FL) was placed within the barrier to support the iontophoretic
current. Using a micromanipulator, the tip of the iontophoresis barrel
was carefully inserted into the agarose until it was approximately
500 μm beneath the surface. Ejections were initiated using a
homemade current source (UNC Electronics Facility, Chapel Hill, NC)
and controlled with customized software.

Amperometry and Liquid
Chromatography
Ejections of
20 mM hydroquinone in 5 mM NaCl were performed into 1.5 mL Eppendorf
polyethylene test tubes containing 100 μL aliquots of phosphate
buffered saline (140 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 10 mM NaH2PO4) adjusted to pH 7.4 with 3 M NaOH. The carbon fiber was used
for amperometric oxidation of ejected hydroquinone at +0.9 V relative
to a Ag/AgCl reference with a UEI current transducer (UNC Chemistry
Electronics Facility, Chapel Hill, NC). The amperometric current was
integrated with respect to time to determine the total amount detected
electrochemically by Faraday’s law. The amount of hydroquinone
that was not amperometrically oxidized was determined using liquid
chromatography (HP series 1050, Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA). Injections
(20 μL) were made onto a C18 reverse phase column (5 μm,
4.6 mm × 250 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with a mobile phase
consisting of 100 mM citric acid, 1 mM sodium hexyl sulfate (Research
Plus, Barnegat, NJ), and 0.1 mM EDTA (pH = 3), with 10% added MeOH.
Amperometric detection at the end of the column employed a glassy
carbon thin layer radial cell (Bioanalytical Systems, West Lafayette,
IN) held at +0.8 V relative to a Ag/AgCl reference. Data were recorded
on customized LabVIEW software (Jorgenson Lab, UNC) using home-built
electronics. The number of moles injected for each sample was determined
by integration of the peak area and comparison to similarly prepared
standards.

Fluorescence Measurements
Epifluorescence
microscopy
was performed using an Eclipse FN1 microscope (Nikon Instruments)
with illumination from a Xenon halide source (X-Cite 120, EXFO). Filter
cubes (Nikon Instruments) were used to select excitation and emission
wavelengths specific to each fluorophore. Images were captured using
a Retiga Exi camera (QImaging, Surrey, BC, Canada) and recorded with
QCapture software (QImaging). For confocal imaging, an SP2 Laser Scanning
Confocal Microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) was used with assistance
from the Michael Hooker Microscopy Facility at the University of North
Carolina Chapel Hill.

Data Analysis
To obtain fluorescence
intensity-distance
profiles for ejections performed on the epifluorescence setup, images
were analyzed using a custom Matlab script (Figure 1A). Overlaid on the fluorescence intensity are 11 cross sections
(dashed lines) that span outward from the tip of the iontophoresis
barrel at 30° intervals. The twelfth cross-section nearest the
barrel was omitted due to optical distortion. The fluorescence intensity
along each line was subtracted from the background and averaged together,
resulting in the final distribution profile for the ejection (Figure 1B). For ejections on the confocal microscope a similar
analysis was employed that utilized the microscope associated software
(LAS-AF lite v 2.6, Leica, Wetzal, Germany).

which the intensity was recorded. The iontophoresis barrel is indicated
by an arrow. (B) Background subtracted fluorescence intensity versus
distance along each cross section (black) and average trace of all
cross sections (green).

Brain Slice Experiments
Coronal brain slices of the
dorsal striatum from male Sprague–Dawley rats were prepared.
The animal was anesthetized with urethane (1.5 g/kg) and decapitated.
Following immediate removal of the brain and immersion into oxygenated
(95% O2/5%CO2) chilled aCSF, a vibratome (VF-200,
Precisionary Instruments, San Jose, CA) was used to cut 300 μm
thick sections. The slices were stored at room temperature in oxygenated
aCSF and transferred to a perfusion chamber (RC-22, Warner Instruments,
Hamden, CT) for measurements during perfusion with a constant stream
of oxygenated aCSF at 37 °C. The iontophoresis barrel was placed
just below the surface of the cortex where the tissue contrast was
determined to be most uniform. During ejections, the perfusion was
temporarily stopped. Animal procedures were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill. Special care was taken to reduce the number of animals
used for this study and to minimize any suffering.

Results and Discussion
Range
of Ejection Velocities
To compare our experimental
results to the theory, we needed to know the iontophoretic ejection
velocities due to electroosmosis so that the Peclet numbers could
be evaluated. To accomplish this, hydroquinone, a neutral molecule,
was ejected into 100 μL aliquots of PBS. A carbon fiber on an
attached barrel was used to quantify and monitor the ejection by amperometric
oxidation (Figure 2A). The amount of hydroquinone
oxidized by the carbon fiber, N, was determined by
Faraday’s law, N = (Qn/F), where n is the number of electrons
(2) transferred in the oxidation step and F is Faraday’s
constant. The charge Q was determined from integration
of the oxidation current with respect to time. The amount of hydroquinone
ejected, but not oxidized and thus remaining in the PBS aliquot, was
determined using liquid chromatography with comparison of peak area
to known standards. The total number of moles of hydroquinone ejected
was calculated as the sum of the moles oxidized at the carbon fiber
and that determined by liquid chromatography. The collection efficiency,
defined as the fraction of hydroquinone detected by the fiber compared
to the total amount ejected, ranged from 18 to 60%. This value was
dependent on the amount of hydroquinone ejected and varied between
barrels. While each barrel showed a linear response of the amount
ejected versus ejection current (3 min ejections), the sensitivity
differed (Figure 2B). The amount of hydroquinone
ejected from five barrels normalized to the amount ejected at 100
nA is plotted versus the magnitude of the ejection current in Figure 2C. This shows that an increase in the ejection current
resulted in a proportional increase in the ejection amount, indicating
the flux and ejection velocity of the barrel solution can be scaled
by the ejection current. Further analysis of ejections in Figure 2C revealed that the volumetric flow rate was between
10 and 175 pL/s for ejection currents from 20 to 100 nA. Using this
range, typical barrel dimensions (a = 0.5–1
μm) and a diffusion coefficient typical of small molecules we
were ejecting (7.5 × 10–6 cm2/s),
eq 5 predicts Pe values between
1.1 and 37. We also examined the flux of ejections for different times
(2–8 min) at a constant ejection current (50 nA). The amount
of hydroquinone ejected normalized to the amount ejected in 8 min
was linear with time, indicating a constant flux from the barrels
(Figure 2D).

Effect of Velocity on Steady-State
Distribution
To
examine the concentration distribution at the tip of the iontophoresis
barrel at different ejection rates, steady-state epifluorescence images
of Ru(bpy)32+ were recorded at different ejection
currents. Steady state was achieved within 2–3 min. We confirmed
that the epifluorescent microscope had sufficient depth of field for
these measurements by comparing results with those obtained from a
confocal microscope (see the Supporting Information). As the ejection current increased, so did the steady-state Ru(bpy)32+ concentration using 4 min ejections (Figure 3A). Because of the higher ionic strength of the
Ru(bpy)32+ solutions that were used, it could
support larger currents compared to barrels that contained neutral
hydroquinone and 5 mM NaCl. The total fluorescence from Ru(bpy)32+ within 500 μm of the barrel tip was determined
by effective spherical integration of the concentration profiles,
assuming spherical symmetry in nonimaged planes. These values were
linear with ejection current when results were averaged from six barrels
(Figure 3B). Once again there was linearity
between the total amount and the ejection current, consistent with
the previously established relationship between velocity and the ejection
current.

Figure 3 Fluorescence at steady state for ejections of 5 mM Ru(bpy)32+ in 5 mM NaCl: (A) The steady-state fluorescence
intensity for ejections ranging from 50 to 2000 nA. (B) The total
fluorescence intensity of Ru(bpy)32+ within
500 μm of the origin versus ejection current. Steady-state distributions
(n = 7) were integrated about a sphere to determine
the total fluorescence. (C) Steady-state fluorescence profiles from
part A normalized at the ejection origin. (D) Steady-state fluorescence
profiles from part A normalized at 100 μm from the origin.

If the diffusion-limited, steady-state
condition is approached
(Pe < 1), then the normalized concentration distribution
should be independent of ejection velocity. To test this, the fluorescence
curves from Figure 3A were normalized by the
fluorescence intensity at a similar distance from the barrel and compared.
When the amplitudes were normalized to their values measured 1 μm
from the barrel tip, the distributions were similar at the lower range
of ejection currents, the expected condition for small values of Pe (Figure 3C). However, at larger
ejection currents the curves diverged. Under these conditions, advection
from the velocity of the barrel solution is sufficient to move previously
ejected solute, indicating Pe > 1. The fluorescent
measurements in agarose thus agree with the liquid chromatographic
results that the Pe values are low for ejection currents
<50 nA with the conditions employed.

To examine the impact
of advection on the steady state distribution
at distances further from the ejection origin, the distributions in
Figure 3A were normalized by the intensity
100 μm from the barrel (Figure 3D). The
close alignment of these curves demonstrates that advective convection
has little effect on the distributions far from the origin. Although
the normalization distance required to see a convergence varied, distributions
obtained from other barrels (n = 7) behaved similarly
when normalized within 100–200 μm of the tip (data not
shown). Thus, even when Pe > 1, the total volume
affected by an ejection at steady-state can be approximated independently
of the ejection current using the apparent diffusion rate of the ejected
species. Spherical integration of the intensity for normalized distributions
displaying the smallest dependence on ejection current revealed that
∼10% of the ejected solute at steady state was within 100 μm
of the barrel.

Effect of Molecular Charge on Steady State
To examine
whether the molecular charge of an ejected species influences the
concentration distribution using solutions that approximate physiological
conditions, steady state profiles of fluorophores with different charges
were compared. The steady-state distributions of ejected fluorescein,
rhodamine B, coumarin 120, and Ru(bpy)32+, which
possess charges at pH 7.4 of 1–, 0, 0, and 2+, respectively,
overlay when normalized by the intensity 30 μm from the barrel
(Figure 4A). These measurements are the average
from at least 12 barrels for each compound. Clearly, the differently
charged fluorophores have similar concentration distributions, indicating
that mass transport by migration away from the barrel tip does not
play a role under these conditions. Additionally, ejections from barrels
containing multiple fluorophores showed no difference in the steady-state
distribution when each was separately imaged (data not shown).

Figure 4 Effect of molecular
charge on steady-state fluorescence distribution:
(A) Average steady state fluorescence profiles (n = 12) normalized at 30 μm for Ru(bpy)32+ (purple), coumarin 120 (orange), rhodamine B (pink), and fluorescein
(green) into 1% agarose. (B) Comparison of steady-state distributions
from part A to the diffusion-limited case (dashed) predicted by eq 10. A plot of the intensity versus 1/r (inset) highlights the transition to diffusion-limited behavior
away from the origin.

In these experiments, the normalization distance of 30 μm
was selected to minimize errors in specifying the center of the ejection
that often was distorted by the carbon fiber. There also exists the
possibility of fluorophore self-quenching, which would be most prevalent
in the concentrated region near the origin. Additionally although
these ejections employed moderate ejection currents (<85 nA), there
is still an advective component that was previously shown to be minimized
by normalization further from the origin. Lastly, Weber and co-workers
showed that a zeta potential mismatch between the glass barrel and
the surrounding medium can induce radial electroosmotic transport
and increase the rate of mass transport of ejected solute.21 To examine whether this was occurring in our
gel, the zeta potential of the glass was altered by raising the ionic
strength of the barrel solution. However, ejections performed of Ru(bpy)32+ in 5 mM and 150 mM NaCl displayed no difference
in the steady state conformation (see the Supporting
Information), indicating that this additional electroosmotic
force was not a factor within the agarose. Thus, we conclude that
under the conditions used in this work, migration away from the barrel
tip is minimized. However, both electroosmosis and migration contribute
to the rate of ejection out of the barrel tip as shown previously.23

To examine further whether the steady-state
profiles were diffusion-limited
away from the origin, the fluorescence distributions were compared
to a theoretical diffusion curve calculated from eq 10. In this case, the steady state distributions from Figure 4A and the 1/r curve were normalized
100 μm from the barrel (Figure 4B). Consistent
with the fact that the experimental distributions were obtained with Pe > 1, there is a noticeable deviation from the diffusion-limited
case near the ejection origin. After the first 100 μm, however,
the distribution follows the 1/r model. To highlight
the transition to diffusion-limited transport, the curves were replotted
on a 1/r axis, shown in the inset of Figure 4B. Here the distributions at distances further from
the barrel (0 < 1/r < 0.01 μm–1) are linear and track the diffusional result curve, demonstrating
that mass transport of ejected solute >100 μm from the barrel
is diffusion controlled.

Steady-State Ejections in Brain Slices
The steady-state
distribution following ejections into brain tissue is expected to
have differences from those measured in agarose due to different structural
and electrical properties. Brain slices exhibit tortuosity in diffusion
pathways that lowers the apparent diffusional rate.28 Furthermore, as Weber demonstrated,29 negative cellular membrane charge may introduce an additional
electroosmotic component not present in the gel. Therefore, we made
iontophoretic ejections of coumarin 120 (neutral) into the cortex
of rat brain slices and compared the concentration profiles to ones
obtained in agarose for the same substance (Figure 5A). When the fluorescence intensities were normalized to the
values 30 μm from the barrel origin, there was only a slight
(but significant) difference between the profiles due to media (p = 0.027, two-way ANOVA). Similarly, the steady-state distribution
of Ru(bpy)32+ in a brain slice also showed only
small differences to the responses in agarose (data not shown). To
ensure that the molecular charge of an ejected species does not influence
the distribution in brain slices, ejections of fluorescein were performed
in brain slices and compared to the coumarin 120 and Ru(bpy)32+ distributions in the same preparation (Figure 5B). As in the agarose gel, the distribution of any
ejected species in brain tissue was not influenced by the charge.

distribution for iontophoretic ejections into rat
brain slices. To minimize Pe, ejections were performed
using moderate ejection currents (<85 nA) and normalized 30 μm
from the origin. (A) Comparison of the steady-state fluorescence intensity

intensity for fluorophores of different charges after 2 min ejections
(n = 6) into the rat cortex. Similar to the ejections
in agarose, different charge states [Ru(bpy)32+ (2+), coumarin 120 (0), and fluorescein (1−)] had no effect
on the distribution.

Modeling of Time-Dependent Diffusive Distribution from an Iontophoretic
Barrel
A description of the diffusion limited distribution
was constructed in LabVIEW for spherically divergent diffusion using
a convolution method established by Engstrom and co-workers.30,31 From the step-response function for spherically divergent diffusion,
the impulse response function was derived, and it was convoluted with
the Heavyside step function that approximates the flux at the origin.
Using a time of 300 s to ensure steady state conformation, Figure 6A displays the convolved profile assuming a diffusion
coefficient of 2.0 × 10–6 cm2/s,
lowered to account for slower diffusion in the brain.28 The validity of the model is confirmed by the overlay of
the 1/r diffusion curve from eq 10. To examine how the concentration will change over the time
course of an ejection, ejections of 30, 60, and 300 s were simulated.
The concentration 100 μm from the source is displayed in Figure 6B (lines), along with experimental data (dots) for
Ru(bpy)32+ fluorescence intensity. The point
source model approximates the experimentally observed formation of
a steady state and its relaxation when the ejection is terminated.
Discrepancies may be explained by the minor advective component near
the barrel that is unaccounted for in the diffusion model. This decreases
the experimental rise time and alters the relaxation concentration
due to differences in the steady-state distribution. During ejection,
full steady state takes a long time to realize but reaches approximately
90% of its value within 100 μm after just 2 min. To visualize
the spatial distribution after terminating an ejection, steady state
was achieved with Ru(bpy)32+ in agarose and
the ejection current was disabled (Figure 6C). When the fluorescence data were plotted similarly to Figures 4 and 5 allowing time for
relaxation from the steady state produced a more dilute and spatially
uniform distribution. This experiment mimics the way iontophoresis
has been used to introduce drugs to modulate dopamine release in the
brain.9 The drug is locally introduced
by iontophoretic ejection, the concentrations are allowed to relax
for a finite period (120 s in our published work), and then the dopaminergic
neurons are stimulated. Changes in amplitude of the evoked release
relative to a predrug release profile indicate the drug action.

the observed behavior. (C) Average (n = 6) Ru(bpy)32+ fluorescence distribution following termination
of an ejection. Steady state was achieved in agarose (black) and the
fluorescence intensity was recorded at 5 (purple, solid), 30 (purple,
dashed), and 90 s (purple, dotted) after the ejection current was
disabled. The intensity for each distribution was normalized by the
intensity at steady state 30 μm from the barrel.

Conclusions
The velocity of solution
ejected from the barrel scales proportionally
with the ejection current. The impact of advection on the concentration
distribution of solute from iontophoretic delivery has been demonstrated
to be significant at high ejection currents but can be minimized by
using low to moderate ejection currents. In any case the distribution
of solute further from the origin (>100 μm) is much less
impacted
by advection and is primarily diffusion-limited. Additionally, for
small molecules such as those considered in this work, the mass transport
of an ejected ion is independent of charge in brain tissue, indicating
that migration outside of the barrel does not play a role on solute
distribution. Lastly, diffusional relaxation from steady state produces
a near uniform concentration bolus within 90 s of terminating the
ejection, demonstrating how iontophoresis may be incorporated in future
applications for more accurate quantification.
