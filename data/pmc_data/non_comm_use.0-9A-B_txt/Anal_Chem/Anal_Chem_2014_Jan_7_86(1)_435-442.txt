A polarization study carried out
on a thin supported liquid membrane
separating two aqueous compartments is presented. Transfer of both
the ionized and uncharged form of an organic tracer dye, rhodamine
B ([9-(2-carboxyphenyl)-6-diethylamino-3-xanthenylidene]-diethylammonium
chloride), across supported liquid membranes composed of one of 1-octanol
(octan-1-ol), 1,9-decadiene (deca-1,9-diene), 1,2-dichlorobenzene,
or nitrophenyl octyl ether (1-(2-nitrophenoxy)octane) was studied
using cyclic voltammetry and UV–vis absorption spectrophotometry.
Concentration analysis indicates that the high membrane concentration
of rhodamine B determines the ionic transfer observed via voltammetry,
which is consistent with the low aqueous ionic concentration and large
membrane/aqueous distribution of the molecule. The observed double-transfer
voltammogram, although it has been largely neglected in previous literature,
is a logical consequence of the presence of two liquid–liquid
interfaces and is rationalized in terms of ion transfer across the
two interfaces on either side of the membrane and supported by voltammograms
obtained for a series of ions of varied lipophilicity. The bipolar
nature of the voltammetric response offers an effective way of mass
transport control via changing polarity of the applied voltage and
finds immediate use in extraction, purification, and separation applications.

==== Body
Supported
liquid membranes (SLM)
are composed of a solvent immobilized on a polymer membrane, which
separates two (usually aqueous) solution phases. They have found use
in liquid–liquid extraction,1 ion-selective
electrodes (ISE),2 pharmaceutical research
as mimics of biological membranes,3 and
the partitioning of actinides.4 Some of
the SLM applications include use of an electrical field to modulate
the membrane’s physicochemical properties.5 Conceptually, the application of electrochemistry to a
SLM can be viewed as a bipolar version of liquid–liquid electrochemistry,
normally performed at the interface between two immiscible electrolyte
solutions (ITIES).6 The connection between
SLMs and electrochemistry at the ITIES motivated various groups to
explore the analogue between the two techniques.

Samec et al.
studied ionized drug transfer across an SLM using
voltammetry7 and also developed theory
to support the observed current–potential dependence.8 Ulmeanu et al. used a commercial 96-well microfilter
plate system to study partitioning of ionized drugs across a SLM9 and the transfer of highly hydrophilic ions10 in a system where only one of the SLM interfaces
is polarizable via use of a common partitioning ion. Murtomäki
et al. studied transfer of tetraalkylammonium cations across an SLM
in the rotating diffusion cell.11 Furthermore,
an extensive theoretical description of the SLM systems supported
with experimental observations was reported by Molina et al.12,13 Electrochemistry on SLM systems is usually performed using a four-electrode
setup, i.e., a pair of reference and counter electrodes placed in
each aqueous phase, which is typical for thin membranes (on the order
of 10–100 μm). A more advanced technique, using a six-electrode
setup, was presented by Kihara and co-workers for thicker membranes
(10 mm), where another pair of electrodes was placed in the membrane
phase.14 Many research activities have
focused on application of SLMs to ISE potentiometry.15,16

The choice of membrane solvents comes from their varied application
and/or relevance to SLM systems. 1-Octanol (commonly known as n-octanol) has become a standard solvent for drug candidate
lipophilicity determination and prediction of absorption in humans.17,18 Whereas the low polarity of 1-octanol requires specific electrochemical
experiments,19,20 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) combines
suitable pharmaceutical relevance with good physical properties and
has thus become a popular choice for liquid–liquid electrochemistry.21,22 However, DCE is not suitable for thin-layer SLMs, due to its relatively
high miscibility with water. A good alternative to DCE is 1,2-dichlorobenzene
(ODCB), since its miscibility with water is lower and it also poses
a lower health hazard than DCE. ODCB has been used in SLM applications
for transfer of both organic23 and inorganic24 species as well as for ion transfer using electrochemical
methods.25 A solvent of pharmaceutical
relevance, which has been used as a biological membrane mimic, is
1,9-decadiene.26−28 It has been shown recently that polarization of an
SLM with 1,9-decadiene as a membrane solvent is possible.29 Finally, nitrophenyl octyl ether (NPOE) is a
solvent widely used in liquid–liquid electrochemistry,30 electro-kinetic extraction of drugs,5,31 ion-selective electrodes,32 and both
passive33 and electrochemically controlled34 drug transfer across SLMs. Herein, the SLM system
was studied using cyclic voltammetry and spectrophotometry using four
membrane solvents, 1-octanol, 1,9-decadiene, ODCB, and NPOE.

The aim of this manuscript is to elucidate the transport of ionized
species across supported liquid membranes using cyclic voltammetry
and spectrophotometry. Challenging properties of the transfer, such
as the direction and extent of the diffusion, concentration distribution,
and dissociation equilibrium, were studied using a model molecule,
rhodamine B [9-(2-carboxyphenyl)-6-diethylamino-3-xanthenylidene]-diethylammonium
chloride. Rhodamine B (RB) is a xanthene derived fluorescent dye with
strong UV–vis absorption used predominantly as a tracer in
biotechnology applications.35−38 Permeability of RB was previously studied in pharmaceutical
research39 and wastewater treatment applications.40 The molecule contains amino- and carboxy-functional
groups, is predominantly uncharged in the aqueous phase at neutral
pH, being a weak base with pKa value of
3.2–3.7,41,42 and has an aqueous diffusion
coefficient of 4.27 × 10–6 cm2 s–1.43 A large distribution
coefficient of RB between the membrane and aqueous phase and the small
fraction of RB+ cations (∼0.05% at pH = 7) in the
aqueous phase results in membrane “sink” conditions.
The high concentration of RB (and RB+) within the membrane
dominates the voltammetric response and shows inversely driven transfer,
i.e., out from the membrane phase.

Most interestingly, rhodamine
B voltammetry across the SLM exhibits
a double-transfer feature, which as shown below, is attributed to
separate transfers at the two ITIES. The double-transfer voltammogram,
which is also presented for a range of other cations and anions of
varied lipophilicity, has important consequences for many SLM applications,
such as extraction, separation, and purification as discussed below.

from Sigma-Aldrich, U.K., and used as received. Potassium chloride
(99%), sodium chloride (99.95%), sodium hydroxide (98.8%), and hydrochloric
acid (analytical reagent grade, 38%) were obtained from Fisher Scientific
UK Ltd. Deionized water, of 18.2 MΩ cm resistivity, purified
by a “PURELAB” Ultrafiltration unit (Elga Process Water,
Marlow, U.K.) was used for solution preparation. Membranes were made
from “Durapore” Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) hydrophobic
membrane filters (0.45 μm pore size, 125 μm thickness,
75% porosity, 13 mm diameter) supplied by Millipore and attached to
a ground glass tube, denoted A (Glass Precision Engineering Ltd.,
Leighton Buzzard, U.K.), using Araldite Rapid glue (Bostik Ltd., Stafford,
U.K.; see Figure 1). The polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE) cell, denoted B, with fiber-optic fittings was made in-house.
The Ag/AgCl reference electrodes were made by oxidation of a silver
wire in 0.1 M potassium chloride solution, at a current density of
5 × 10–3 A cm–2, and enclosing
the wire in saturated KCl solution separated from the system by a
“Vycor” porous glass frit (3 mm diameter, SciMed Ltd.,
Cheadle, U.K.). Platinum wire (0.5 mm diameter, 99.99%) and platinum
mesh (0.1 mm plain weave wire, 420 per cm2, open area 62.7%)
were used for counter electrode preparation. All metals were obtained
from Advent Research Materials (Oxford, U.K.).

and the blue line shows the UV–vis optical path.

Apparatus
The experimental setup
was described in detail
previously.29 A schematic diagram of the
SLM system with embedded apparatus for simultaneous electrochemical
and in situ UV–visible detection is depicted
in Figure 1. The system consists of two cells,
A and B, which contain the buffered aqueous phase with electrolyte
and are separated by a supported liquid membrane. The PTFE cell B
was fitted with the fiber-optic and connected to a UV–vis absorption
spectrometer (DH-2000-BAL, supplied by Ocean Optics, Duiven, The Netherlands)
equipped with a DH-2000-BD deuterium bulb, DH-2000-BH tungsten halogen
bulb, and USB2000 interface (Micropack GmbH, Ostfildern, Germany).
Sodium phosphate was used as a buffer to maintain pH 7.0, and sodium
chloride is used as electrolyte to support current flow in the aqueous
phase. Tetradodecylammonium tetrakis(4-chlorophenyl)borate (TDDATPBCl4) was added to the membrane solvent as the electrolyte for
the organic phase. Rhodamine B was the primary analyte for the transfer
across the SLM. Tetramethylammonium (TMA+), tetraethylammonium
(TEA+), tetrabutylammonium (TBA+), and crystal
violet (CrV+) purchased as chloride salts and tetrafluoroborate
(BF4–), perchlorate (ClO4–), and dodecylsulfate (DS–) purchased
as sodium salts were also used as analytes. Each aqueous phase contained
a pair of counter and reference electrodes (denoted C and R), to allow
the polarization of the SLM. Each counter–reference electrode
pair was connected together via a 100 nF capacitor to reduce externally
induced electrical noise (Farnell, Leeds, U.K.). The four electrodes
were connected to the potentiostat/galvanostat (Autolab PGSTAT 100,
Metrohm-Autolab BV, Utrecht, The Netherlands) with polarity corresponding
to the potential difference between the aqueous phases B and A, ΔEB/A. The two organic/aqueous interfaces have
geometric membrane areas (total area × porosity) of 0.59 cm2 (SLM/phase A) and 0.78 cm2 (SLM/phase B) giving
an averaged membrane area of 0.68 cm2 (different areas
are the result of membrane attachment to the glass donor tube; see
Figure 1). Rotation at 200 rpm (21 rad s–1) of the membrane was applied in some cases. This
was controlled using a Model 616 rotating-disc controller (EG&G
Parc). Solution pH was measured using a HI991300 pH meter (Hanna Instruments).

The composition of the supported liquid membrane cell can be described
as follows: Ag(s)|AgCl(s)|KCl(sat.)|10 mM NaH2PO4, 10 (or 100) mM NaCl, xRB (TMA+, TEA+, TBA+, CrV+, BF4–, ClO4–, DS– at 1
mM), pH 7.0 (aq) ∥ 10 mM TDDATPBCl4 (1-octanol,
1,9-decadiene, ODCB or NPOE) ∥ 10 mM NaH2PO4, 10 (or 100) mM NaCl, yRB (TMA+, TEA+, TBA+, BF4–, ClO4–, DS– at 1
mM), pH 7.0 (aq)|KCl(sat.)|AgCl(s)|Ag(s).

Where x and y are in the range
of 0–100 μM. High conductivity of the aqueous phase implies
that the system resistivity varies depending on the membrane solvent.
Internal IR compensation was applied for each solvent system in order
to compensate for the current induced by the applied potential difference
due to resistance of the system (1,9-decadiene ∼ 45–55
kΩ; 1-octanol ∼ 8–9 kΩ; ODCB ∼ 2–3.5
kΩ; NPOE ∼ 2–3 kΩ). The resistivity value
of the membrane was determined from the resistance measured via potentiostat
and the membrane thickness. A two phase shake-flask method and UV–vis
spectrophotometry was used to determine the distribution of RB between
the organic and aqueous phase.

Results and Discussion
Rhodamine
B Permeability and Distribution Across the SLM
Rhodamine
B, added to aqueous phase A at a concentration of 100 μM,
permeates through the SLM due to the concentration gradient between
the aqueous phases. The permeation rate is governed by the diffusion
coefficients in the aq. phase and the membrane, membrane/aqueous distribution
coefficient, concentration equilibrium, and extent of stirring. The
SLM was rotated about its vertical axis, as indicated in Figure 1, maintaining stable hydrodynamic conditions on
both sides of the membrane and uniform mixing of both the aqueous
phases. The permeation of RB across a nonpolarized SLM containing
one of the four solvents, 1-octanol, 1,9-decadiene, ODCB, or NPOE,
at a constant stirring rate of 200 rpm (21 rad s–1) is shown in Figure 2. Rhodamine B absorbs
strongly in the visible region (maximum absorption coefficient of
8.79 × 104 M–1 cm–1 at 555 nm, aqueous pH 7.0), and therefore, the appearance of the
molecule in phase B can be monitored (inset of Figure 2). RB was stable under UV–vis light as shown in the Supporting Information (S-2).

Figure 2 Hydrodynamically controlled
permeation of rhodamine B across a
nonpolarized SLM rotated at 200 rpm (21 rad s–1).
RB was initially present in the aq. phase A only (x = 100 μM). The absorbance at wavelength of 555 nm in aq. phase
B is recorded with time for the four solvents: black, 1,9-decadiene;
red curve, 1-octanol; blue curve, NPOE; green curve, ODCB. The inset
graph shows a UV–vis spectrum of 3 μM RB in the aqueous
phase at pH 7.0.

The effective permeability
coefficients, Pe, were determined from
the concentration–time profile
as described elsewhere.27,29 Briefly, the time-dependent
concentration in phase B was transformed into a function, k, also depending on the initial analytical (total) concentration
in phase A and the volumes of both the aqueous phases. The logarithm
of this function changes linearly with time, t, after
a steady-state diffusion profile has been established across the three
phases: 1  where a is defined as follows: 2  where A is the membrane area,
and VD and VA are the donor and acceptor phase volumes, respectively.

In
the case of “infinite” stirring, i.e., when the
aqueous diffusion layer is compressed to zero, the aqueous analytical
concentrations cA and cB are uniform throughout the phases A and B, respectively,
and the membrane concentration changes linearly inside the membrane
as depicted in a qualitative schematic in Figure 3 (black solid lines). The membrane and aqueous concentrations
are related via distribution coefficient, Kd: 3  where cM,A and cM,B denote the steady-state concentrations
of
RB in the membrane near the interface with phases A and B, respectively.
The distribution coefficient, Kd, of rhodamine
B between the organic phase and aqueous phase was determined using
the standard shake-flask method. For a general case of a finite stirring
rate, the aqueous concentration near the membrane changes according
to diffusion laws, resulting in an altered steady-state profile as
depicted by the blue dashed curves in Figure 3. Therefore, in reality, the membrane interfacial concentrations
will be slightly lower (cM,A) and higher
(cM,B), respectively, as demonstrated
by the blue dashed line in Figure 3. Steady-state
conditions at any stirring rate, i.e., an approximately linear concentration
profile within the membrane, allow the mean membrane concentration, cM, to be calculated as a simple arithmetic average
of cM,A and cM,B.

Figure 3 A qualitative schematic showing the concentration profile of a
model molecule (Kd = 3) across the supported
liquid membrane system with concentration gradient between the phases
A and B. The black solid lines represent the aqueous steady-state
concentrations, cA and cB, and the average membrane steady-state concentration cM for an ideal case of “infinite”
stirring of the aqueous phases; cM,A and cM,B denote the steady-state concentrations in
the membrane near the interface with phases A and B, respectively.
Blue curves represent a generic steady-state profile of finite aqueous
stirring, and the red curve represents the transient membrane loading
effect.

The extent of analyte permeation
varies significantly with the
membrane solvent used as Figure 2 shows. The
1,9-decadiene system has the fastest permeation of RB across the SLM,
followed by 1-octanol and NPOE. ODCB exhibits the slowest membrane
permeation of the analyte. The permeability and distribution coefficient
data (Table 1) show the opposite trend to that
normally expected; i.e., here, the highest distribution coefficient
corresponds to the lowest permeability. This is rationalized in terms
of a membrane loading effect (lag-time period before the concentration
steady-state is reached), typical for molecules with a large distribution
coefficient.44 The high affinity of RB
for the organic phase means large amounts of the molecule must be
transferred to the SLM in order to reach steady-state concentration.
Consequently, the appearance of the molecule in phase B is slower,
and the time needed before the steady-state is reached increases as
depicted by the red dotted curve in Figure 3.

In fact, the rapid depletion of
phase A in favor of the SLM provides
membrane sink conditions as shown by the concentration analysis. The
steady-state concentration distribution between the aqueous phases
and the membrane, determined from the UV–vis measurement, and
distribution coefficient and mass balance is summarized in Table 1. The concentration profile in the phase A–SLM–phase
B system was a basis for the analysis and rationalization of the observed
RB+ transfer across the double ITIES (see below).

Transfer
of Rhodamine B across the SLM Using Voltammetry
SLMs were
formed using the group of four organic solvents (1-octanol,
1,9-decadiene, ODCB, or NPOE), and the transfer of the rhodamine B
cation (RB+) was studied using voltammetry. 1,9-Decadiene,
ODCB, and NPOE SLMs exhibit a large potential window of about 1.2
V centered around 0 V, which is suitable for transfer of ions within
this potential range. 1-Octanol did not prove to be suitable for voltammetry
due to its high resistivity and narrow potential window. Comparison
and analysis of the analyte-free (blank) spectroelectrochemical data
for all four solvents is shown in the Supporting
Information (S-3). The changes in UV–vis absorption
of RB+ induced by polarization are negligible compared
to the permeation fluxes, and therefore, monitoring of the concentration
changes via spectrophotometry was not possible.

Figure 4a shows cyclic voltammograms obtained for each solvent
system after the nonpolarized permeation (Figure 2) was completed, i.e., when the analyte flux has reached a
steady-state. Two pairs of the observed transfer peaks, symmetrical
about the zero potential difference axis, are observed for all the
solvents, except 1-octanol, are attributed to the double transfer
of the analyte across the respective interfaces, and are discussed
in detail below. Several conclusions can be deduced from the size
of the current, shape of the voltammogram, and difference between
the three membrane solvents, where double transfer was seen (i.e.,
1,9-decadiene, ODCB, and NPOE).

Figure 4 Voltammetry of rhodamine B transfer across
the SLM system as a
function of applied potential difference between phases B and A. The
direction of all voltammograms was toward negative potentials first
with a starting potential of 0 V. (a) Comparison of voltammograms
obtained after the permeation measurement (RB was initially present
in the phase A only, x = 100 μM, y = 0 μM) at a scan rate of 20 mV s–1 and
membrane rotation of 200 rpm (21 rad s–1) using
1,9-decadiene (black), NPOE (blue), ODCB (green), and 1-octanol (red)
as SLM solvents. (b) Detailed voltammograms in the NPOE system at
scan rates of 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 mV s–1,
corresponding to black, red, golden, green, blue, and violet curves,
respectively. RB was initially present in both aqueous phases (x = y = 100 μM), and the membrane
was not rotated. The gray curve represents a “blank”
voltammogram, i.e., that for an analyte-free system (x = y = 0).

First, although the observed voltammogram has a shape intermediate
between a peak-shape and a limiting current plateau, even though the
aqueous phases on both sides of the membrane had mass transport controlled
via stirring,45 the voltammograms carried
out under stagnant aqueous conditions did not reveal a substantial
change in the peak size. Furthermore, changes in the stirring rate
had a limited effect on the peak current. This indicates that the
observed transfer of RB+ via applied potential is predominantly
governed by the transport in the stagnant membrane phase.

In
other words, the observations indicate that peaks 1 and 3 correspond
to transfer of RB+ cation out of the membrane to aqueous
phases B and A, respectively, according to the applied potential difference
between B and A. This transfer is most likely coupled to the cotransport
of the membrane anion (TPBCl4–) out of/into
the membrane as indicated in Figure 4a (detailed
analysis of the coupled transfer mechanism is given in the Supporting Information, S-4).

Second,
the maximum aqueous concentration of RB+ cation
found from the dissociation equilibrium at pH 7.0 is ∼0.05
μM (pKa ∼ 3.2–3.7),
while the current corresponds to the concentration of the transferred
ion of about 0.1–5 mM depending on the SLM solvent (from eq 4, below). This large concentration mismatch and the
change of current with solvent strongly support the conclusion that
the membrane rather than aqueous concentration drives the transfer.

Finally, the current response of the different solvent systems
is proportional to the distribution coefficient between the SLM and
aqueous phase. The increase in the distribution coefficient results
in a higher concentration inside the membrane; however, the current
also depends on the RB+ diffusion within the membrane.
A modified Randles-Ševčík equation, which relates
the diffusion-limited transfer peak current, Ip, to the system properties, was derived by Samec et al. for
the SLM system at 298 K:8 4  where z is the charge of
the transferred ion, F is the Faraday constant, AX is the area of the relevant membrane surface
corrected for porosity, DM is the diffusion
coefficient of the ion i in the membrane phase, ci,M,X is the membrane ionic concentration at
the interface with phase X (A or B), and ν is the scan rate
(note the dimensionless peak current function is 0.4463 for a reversible
charge transfer across a single electrified interface). Combining
the analytical (total) concentration of RB in the system obtained
from UV–vis absorption and the ionic concentration calculated
accurately from the measured current, eq 4 allows
us to determine the dissociation equilibrium in the organic phase.
Table 2 shows diffusion coefficients of RB
in each solvent (calculated using the solvent viscosity, aqueous diffusion
coefficient, and the Stokes–Einstein equation30,43,46−48) and the peak
current values (peak 1 and 3). Equation 4 was
used to calculate the effective ionic concentrations within the membrane
at both interfaces: the corresponding concentrations on the aqueous
sides of the interface were found from the distribution coefficients
(Table 3). The concentrations determined imply
that the membrane-to-aqueous transfer dominates the observed voltammetric
response. Note that, for the stirred system (Figure 4a), the current–potential response of membrane-to-aqueous
transfer (peaks 1 and 3) shows indications of a sigmoidal shape, indicating
that stirring results in a quasi-linear concentration profile within
the membrane. In contrast, the voltammograms recorded at scan rates
between 5 and 80 mV s–1, carried out in an unstirred
NPOE supported liquid membrane system (Figure 4b), show a peak-shape current–potential response indicating
linear diffusion on both sides of the membrane. Peaks 1 and 3 of Figure 4b were used for an accurate current–scan
rate gradient analysis using eq 4 (NPOE data
in Table 3). The unusual behavior of partially
charged species at the interface between two immiscible liquids, which
has been described previously for a simple liquid–liquid system,49 gives rise to a complex ionization and distribution
equilibrium and hindered accurate quantitative analysis of rhodamine
B in terms of the models for SLM transport, as further discussed in
the Supporting Information (S-5).

The existence of the two pairs
of transfer peaks observed in the
voltammograms is now discussed. Each pair of peaks is attributed to
transfer out of and back into the membrane phase at the relevant membrane
interface, i.e., peaks 1 and 2 correspond to analyte transfer at M|B
interface and peaks 3 and 4 to transfer at M|A interface, as indicated
in Figure 4a. The double voltammetric transfer
peak is a direct and logical consequence of the ionic transfer in
systems with two interfaces; however, despite the considerable volume
of literature on both experimental7−11,14,25,52,53 and theoretical12,13,54 membrane voltammetry, the majority
of authors have not discussed this phenomenon. This is likely due
to the analyte ions being present in only one of the aqueous phases,
resulting in a single-pair of peaks in a voltammogram. Should one
use an ion with substantial partitioning into the membrane, another
pair of transfer peaks should be detectable, as shown for RB+ in Figure 4a. Similarly, placing the analyte
ion in both aqueous phases will result in double-transfer voltammetry,
as shown below for multiple ions. To the best of our knowledge, the
only description of this double-transfer voltammogram, which has important
consequences for many membrane science applications, was given by
Shirai et al., who provided a detailed analysis of the double-interface
system and studied the effect of supporting electrolyte on the ion
transfer using a 6-electrode setup with a 1 cm-thick nitrobenzene
SLM.14 Samec et al. reported voltammetric
transfer of ionized species in an supported NPOE membrane, but only
the positive half of the voltammogram was shown.8 Similar results were reported by Ulmeanu et al.,10 suggesting that the double transfer may have
been observed previously, but a detailed description of this phenomenon
was not given. Molina et al. derived a substantial theoretical body
of work, supported with experiments, to describe voltammetry at membrane
interfaces; however, only cases where fairly hydrophilic ions were
present in one of the aqueous phases were considered, in contrast
to the RB+ case described above.12,13,54

The observed double-transfer voltammogram
is a direct consequence
of the existence of two interfaces and therefore two energy barriers
that the ion has to overcome on transfer from aqueous phase A to B
(or vice versa). The addition of a second ITIES in series has the
effect of increasing the overall voltage of the system.55−57 As a result, the potential window is doubled in comparison to a
single ITIES interface system. When there is no potential difference
between the two aqueous phases, the ions remain in their respective
phases. On application of the potential difference, the ions will
transfer in the relevant direction (cations toward the more negative
phase and anions to the more positive phase). Figure 5 shows cyclic voltammograms obtained for a series of cations
with differing standard Gibbs energies of transfer, which are present
in both aqueous phases (except CrV+), with a full series
of analyzed species including anions given in the Supporting Information, S-6). Increasing hydrophilicity of
the ions results in a requirement for an increasing cell voltage in
order to transfer the ions across the respective interface, with the
most hydrophilic cation, tetramethylammonium, transferring near the
positive and negative vertices of the potential window. The tetralkylammonium
transfers are assumed to be coupled to the transfer of chloride ion
across the other solution/membrane interface, as indicated in Figure 5. This observation may be rationalized by consideration
of the Galvani potential distribution across the individual interfaces.
A finite potential difference should be dropped equally across both
interfaces (A|M and M|B) in a symmetrical system.14 Therefore, the resultant potential window is extended by
a factor of n, where n is the number
of interfaces.

Figure 5 Cyclic voltammograms of transfer of selected cations in
a NPOE
supported liquid membrane system. The black, red, gold, and green
curves denote tetramethylammonium (TMA+), tetraethylammonium
(TEA+), tetrabutylammonium (TBA+), and crystal
violet (CrV+) voltammograms, respectively. X+ stands for any of the studied cations.

The half-wave potentials of transfer of the studied cations, Ei1/2, are listed in Table 4. Data suggests that the half-wave potential values
are reasonably symmetrical about the zero potential difference. Also,
the order of the observed half-wave potentials is in agreement with
the lipophilicity of the ions (standard Gibbs energy of transfer)
reported by various groups.30,58,59 The exact Ei1/2 value, however,
will depend not only on the standard transfer potentials across a
single ITIES, Δϕi0, of the cation
and its counterion (chloride) but also on other parameters, and development
of a suitable theoretical model is beyond the scope of this work.
The half-wave potential formula for a system, where the studied cation
is supplied only from one of the aqueous phases and compensating current
flow at the other liquid–liquid interface is facilitated by
organic electrolyte cation, has been derived by Samec et al.(eq 14
in8) and Molina et al.(eqs 21–23
in54): note, however, that there is a discrepancy
between the diffusion coefficients used in the two papers. Ei1/2 has been shown to depend on
the standard transfer potentials across single ITIES, Δϕi0, of the studied cation and its counterion (org.
phase cation), their analytical concentrations and diffusion coefficients
in both membrane and aqueous phase, and the Ohmic potential drop.
The peak separation, ΔEp, of 60
mV and dimensionless current of 1.13 for a symmetric system, where
the studied ion is present in both aqueous phases surrounding a thick
membrane, was suggested by Kakiuchi.60 ΔEp of tetraalkylammonium ions and RB transfer,
however, ranges between 80 and 150 mV, and the dimensionless current
varies between 0.209 and 0.346 as shown in Table 4. This is most likely due to the overlap of the two diffusion
layers inside the thin membrane,8,60 which is supported
by the observed change of peak separation with scan rate (full table
listing Ei1/2 and ΔEp values for all the studied ions is found in Supporting Information, S-6).

values for the peaks in
the negative and positive branches of the voltammogram are shown (obtained
from 40 mV s–1 scans).

In contrast to tetraalkylammonium ions, crystal violet
has only
been added to one of the aqueous phases (A), which results in a single
pair of voltammetric peaks as reported in the literature referred
to above. The peak separation and the dimensionless peak current on
the forward scan have been determined as 92 mV and 0.349, respectively,
in reasonable agreement with the theoretical values (91 mV and 0.384,
respectively) derived for this asymmetric system.8 Furthermore, the lipophilic CrV+ (which has
in fact been used as an organic phase electrolyte by various group;
the absolute value of its standard Gibbs energy of transfer is close
to that of chloride61,62) is readily transferred to the
membrane phase, and the observed half-wave potential of the coupled
transfer is close to zero (Ei1/2 = −4 mV).

The observed double-transfer of ions across
the double ITIES has
important consequences for membrane applications such as separation,
purification, or extraction of anions and cations.5,63,64 Due to the reversibility of the transfer,
both membrane and aqueous phases can be used as donor or acceptor
phases in these applications. For example, a mixture of ions can be
separated depending on the ions’ lipophilicity and thereby
concentrated in one of the phases. This could be done either in an
aqueous–organic–aqueous or an organic–aqueous–organic
configuration depending on the particular application. As demonstrated
above, the transfer of the analyte is not restricted to only one of
the liquid–liquid interfaces and electrochemistry can be used
to control analyte distribution in all three liquid phases. Furthermore,
the supported liquid systems not only are restricted to use of one
membrane with two liquid–liquid interfaces but also can be
constructed in series, similar to battery construction, increasing
the contact surface area between the two phases and therefore transfer
efficiency, which is particular appealing when used in a flow or microfluidic
configuration.65−68 The exploitation of potential SLM applications has already proven
of significant interest in research areas such as drug extraction,1 purification processes,69 microreaction apparatus for synthetic chemistry,70 concentration of analytes in order to increase the limit
of detection,71 separation of heavy metals/radioactive
elements,72,73 or leaching of metal ions from ore.74

Conclusions
A voltammetric and spectrophotometric
study of rhodamine B transfer
across the supported liquid membrane, separating two aqueous phases,
is presented. The data obtained from both analytical methods is used
to determine the concentration profile of rhodamine B cations and
its uncharged form across the aqueous–membrane–aqueous
layers. Application of a potential difference between the two aqueous
phases and measurement of the transfer current indicate that, for
a lipophilic species such as rhodamine B, the transfer is driven in
the “out of membrane” direction, due to its high membrane
concentration and limited availability of ions in the aqueous phases.
Most interestingly, a double-transfer peak is observed for rhodamine
B voltammetry, indicating two separate transfers occur at each liquid–liquid
interface depending on the polarity of the applied potential difference.
Surprisingly, with the exception of one research group,14 this feature has not been described in the literature
and requires refinement of existing models of ion transfer across
SLMs.

The approach described has important consequences for
SLM applications
such as electrically modulated extraction, separation, and purification
of ions and in many other areas. The membrane composition and potential
window can be fine-tuned to the ion of interest and, depending on
its lipophilicity, either membrane or aqueous phases can be used as
the target phase in which ions are concentrated. Particularly attractive
is the idea of an “electrochemical switch” where lipophilic
ions, such as rhodamine B, can be trafficked to either side of the
membrane, simply by changing the polarity of the voltage source. This
concept is not limited to systems with one SLM but can be extended
to a series of membranes, for example, in a linear flow system, allowing
complex mixtures of ions to be processed effectively. Furthermore,
cations and anions can be separated in one step and concentrated in
separate phases. Clearly, this setup can be reversed to an organic–aqueous
membrane–organic arrangement and similar methods applied to
more hydrophilic ions.
