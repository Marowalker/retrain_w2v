Toxicity from acute exposure to nerve
agents and organophosphorus
toxicants is due to irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase
(AChE) in the nervous system. AChE in red blood cells is a surrogate
for AChE in the nervous system. Previously we developed an immunopurification
method to enrich red blood cell AChE (RBC AChE) as a biomarker of
exposure. The goal of the present work was to provide an alternative
RBC AChE enrichment strategy, by binding RBC AChE to Hupresin affinity
gel. AChE was solubilized from frozen RBC by addition of 1% Triton
X-100. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation. The red, but
not viscous, RBC AChE solution was loaded on a Hupresin affinity column.
Hemoglobin and other proteins were washed off with 3 M NaCl, while
retaining AChE bound to Hupresin. Denatured AChE was eluted with 1%
trifluoroacetic acid. The same protocol was used for 20 mL of RBC
AChE inhibited with a soman model compound. The acid denatured protein
was digested with pepsin and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem
mass spectrometry on a 6600 Triple-TOF mass spectrometer. A targeted
method identified the aged soman adduct on serine 203 in peptide FGESAGAAS. It was concluded that Hupresin can be used to enrich
soman-inhibited AChE solubilized from 8 mL of frozen human erythrocytes,
yielding a quantity sufficient for detecting soman exposure.

==== Body
Chemical warfare nerve agents
and organophosphorus pesticides are toxic to humans because they disrupt
cholinergic nerve impulse transmission. The toxicants irreversibly
inhibit acetylcholinesterase, resulting in accumulation of excess
acetylcholine and loss of muscle function. Human acetylcholinesterase
(AChE) in red blood cells (RBC) serves as a surrogate for AChE in
the nervous system.1 It should be possible
to monitor toxicant exposure by measuring adducts on the active site
serine of RBC AChE, using mass spectrometry assays similar to those
for adducts on the active site serine of plasma butyrylcholinesterase.2−4 RBC AChE is not as easy to work with as plasma butyrylcholinesterase,
because RBC AChE is membrane bound,5 and
the concentration of RBC AChE is lower at 0.5 μg/mL compared
to plasma butyrylcholinesterase at 4–5 μg/mL.

We
recently developed monoclonal antibodies that can be used to
immunopurify RBC AChE after the RBC AChE has been solubilized by addition
of 1% Triton X-100.6 The immunopurified
RBC AChE was treated with a soman model compound and digested with
pepsin. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry identified
the FGESAGAAS peptide modified on the active site serine by aged soman.
The method requires monoclonal antibodies and solid supports for immobilizing
the antibodies.

The present report provides a simpler protocol
for enriching RBC
AChE to use for detecting nerve agent exposure. In place of antibodies,
we used the commercially available affinity ligand Hupresin to capture
RBC AChE. The AChE remained bound while contaminating proteins were
washed off with 3 M NaCl and while the Hupresin was desalted by washing
with water. Denatured, but not active AChE, was eluted with 1% trifluoroacetic
acid. The denatured AChE was digested with pepsin and analyzed by
liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. A targeted
mass spectrometry method was used to detect the parent and daughter
ions for the aged soman-labeled active site peptide of RBC-AChE.

Materials
and Methods
Hupresin was synthesized by Emilie David at the
CHEMFORASE company,
Mont-Saint-Aignan, France, emilie.david@chemforase.com. The soman model compound O-pinacolyl methylphosphonothiomethyl
(soman Sp-thiomethyl) was synthesized in the laboratory
of John Cashman7 and stored in dimethyl
sulfoxide at −80 °C. Packed red blood cells were a gift
from the Nebraska Medical Center blood bank. Recombinant human AChE
(rHuAChE) (P22303) was expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells and
purified by procainamide affinity chromatography.6 Porcine pepsin (from stomach mucosa) was from Sigma-Aldrich
P-6887. YM-10 regenerated cellulose centrifugal filter 10000 NMWL,
MRCPRT010, was from Merck Millipore Ltd.

No-Ghost Method for Solubilizing
RBC AChE
Frozen RBC
(80 mL) were thawed and diluted with 120 mL of 1% Triton X-100 in
PBS, 0.1% azide. This solubilized the membrane-bound AChE but left
a small amount of insoluble debris. The debris was removed by centrifugation
in microfuge tubes for 30 min at 14000 rpm (12000g). The solubilized no-ghost RBC AChE solution was red, but not viscous.
No-ghost RBC AChE activity was 1.8 u/mL.

The classical method
for preparing RBC AChE washes away hemoglobin before solubilizing
the membrane-bound AChE with Triton X-100.8,9 The
hemoglobin-free cells are called ghosts. To simplify the process,
we did not prepare red cell ghosts and therefore named our preparation
no-ghost RBC AChE.

Enzyme Activity Assays
AChE activity
was measured in
0.1 M potassium phosphate pH 7.0 at 25 °C with 1 mM acetylthiocholine
iodide in the presence of 0.5 mM 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic
acid) on a Gilford spectrophotometer interfaced to a MacLab data recorder
(ADInstruments, Inc.). No-ghost RBC AChE solutions (5 μL) were
preincubated with 1.98 mL of 0.5 mM 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic
acid) in buffer for 10 min or more to deplete free sulfhydryl groups
before the AChE reaction with acetylthiocholine was started by addition
of 0.02 mL of 0.1 M acetylthiocholine. The increase in absorbance
at 412 nm was converted to micromoles acetylthiocholine hydrolyzed
using the extinction coefficient 13600 M–1 cm–1.10 Units of activity are
expressed as micromoles per min. AChE u/mL (pH 7) were converted to
mg/mL using the conversion factor of 5000 u/mg.11

Mass Spectrometry Standard for a Soman Model
Compound-Inhibited
Human AChE
rHuAChE in 0.5 mL of 20 mM TrisCl pH 7.5, 0.19
M NaCl had an activity of 40000 u/mL, which calculates to 8 μg/μL.
After overnight incubation with 4 μL of soman Sp thiomethyl dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, AChE activity was reduced
99.9% to 84 u/mL. Aliquots of the soman-inhibited rHuAChE were digested
with pepsin for 2 h at 37 °C at a constant ratio of 40 μg
rHuAChE and 80 μg pepsin in various volumes of 1% formic acid
ranging from 800 μL to 25 μL. A 1 μL aliquot from
each digest was examined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with dihydroxybenzoic
acid matrix in negative mode to identify the conditions that yielded
a good signal for the aged soman adduct on the active site peptide
FGESAGAAS. All digests ranging from 0.05 to 1.6 μg AChE per
μL yielded the expected mass for the aged soman adduct. The
best signal was for the highest AChE concentration. Digests were filtered
through a YM-3 spin filter to remove intact pepsin and stored at −20
°C until used as standards in the 6600 Triple-TOF mass spectrometer.
We have confidence that the quantity of rHuAChE digest applied to
the mass spectrometer in Figure 4A was 8 μg because the rHuAChE sample was not
subjected to the sample preparation steps used for RBC AChE and therefore
had minimal losses.

Inhibition of RBC AChE with Soman Sp-Thiomethyl
No-ghost RBC AChE in 0.6% Triton
X-100 was treated with soman Sp-thiomethyl. This
soman model compound has a thiomethyl
group in place of the fluoride ion in authentic soman12 and has the Sp-configuration. The soman
model compound had been diluted into dimethyl sulfoxide so that a
4 μL aliquot added to 50 mL of RBC AChE reduced its AChE activity
93% from 1.8 to 0.12 u/mL after overnight incubation at 4 °C.

Hupresin for Partial Purification of No-Ghost RBC AChE
No-ghost
RBC AChE was prepared by adding 12 mL of 1% Triton X-100
in PBS, 0.1% azide to 8 mL of human RBC. The RBC had been stored frozen
at −20 °C, but were thawed before use. Cell debris was
removed by centrifugation. AChE activity measured with acetylthiocholine
was 1.8 u/mL. The 20 mL solution was loaded on 2 mL of Hupresin packed
in a Pharmacia C10/10 column. Hemoglobin and other proteins were washed
off with 20 mL of 0.1 M potassium phosphate pH 7, 20 mL of 1 M NaCl
in buffer, and 20 mL of 3 M NaCl. Hupresin was desalted with 20 mL
of water before bound AChE was eluted with 1 mL aliquots of 1% trifluoroacetic
acid. About 15% of the AChE activity was lost in the flow through
during loading and washing.

The Hupresin column was cleaned
with 20 mL of 0.1 M NaOH to remove a brown color from heme and equilibrated
with 0.1 M potassium phosphate pH 7. We previously reported that the
binding capacity of Hupresin was unchanged by sanitation with 0.1
M NaOH.13 The same 2 mL Hupresin column
was used to partially purify soman-inhibited no-ghost RBC AChE using
the protocol described above.

SDS Gel Electrophoresis
and Digestion with Trypsin
The 1 mL fractions of RBC AChE
in 1% trifluoroacetic acid were dried,
dissolved in 50 μL of SDS gel loading buffer and heated in a
boiling water bath for 3 min. A 20 μL aliquot of each fraction
was run on a precast 4–20% gradient gel to identify the protein-containing
fractions. To determine whether RBC AChE had eluted with 1% TFA, gel
bands were excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS
as described.13

Digestion with Pepsin
A 20 mL solution of no-ghost
RBC AChE was inhibited with the soman model compound to 7% of its
original activity, from 1.8 to 0.12 u/mL. During the 16 h treatment
with the soman model compound, the adduct lost the pinacolyl group
leaving only methylphosphonate on the active site serine. Soman-inhibited
AChE in 20 mL was partially purified by affinity chromatography on
2 mL of Hupresin as described for control, uninhibited RBC AChE. The
trifluoroacetic acid-extracts containing soman-inhibited RBC AChE
were dried in a vacuum centrifuge. The dry pellet was brown. The pellet
was dissolved in 50 μL of 0.1% formic acid. The brown solution
was digested with 300 μL of a freshly prepared 2 mg/mL pepsin
solution in 0.6% formic acid for 2 h at 37 °C. The brown material
was removed by filtering the digest through a YM-10 spin filter. The
colorless filtrate was dried, dissolved in 40 μL of 0.1% formic
acid and centrifuged for 30 min at maximum speed in a microfuge (12000g). The top 10 μL were transferred to an autosampler
vial. A 5 μL aliquot was injected into the liquid chromatography
tandem mass spectrometer instrument. We had expected a yield of 0.7–7
μg of RBC AChE if losses during sample preparation were minimal.
However, the yield appeared to be 0.007 μg based on signal intensity
in the MSMS spectrum in Figure 4B compared to that for the control sample in Figure 4A.

The nine residue active
site peptide FGESAGAAS is the result of cleavage at serine, a nonclassical
cleavage site for pepsin. Unusually high quantities of pepsin are
required to produce the nine-residue peptide, as pointed out by Fidder
et al.14 and confirmed by others.2−4,6,15−17 Digestion with lower quantities of pepsin yields
a mixture of active site peptides, containing 12 residues or more.
The 9-residue peptide is ideal for mass spectrometry analysis because
the short peptide ionizes readily and yields a fragmentation spectrum
that contains at least three characteristic fragment ions.

Liquid
Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry for Pepsin-Digested
Protein
Data were acquired on a 6600 Triple-TOF mass spectrometer
(AB Sciex) fitted with a nanospray source. Peptides were separated
by ultra high pressure liquid chromatography (Eksigent, Dublin, CA)
before they were introduced into the mass spectrometer. Two data acquisition
schemes were employed. The first was a traditional data dependent
acquisition scheme to which we added an organophosphylation category
to the Data Dictionary and Parameter Translation files to facilitate
detection of organophosphate-modified peptides. This scheme was used
for analyzing the rHuAChE control sample. Data were searched against
the Uniprot/Swissprot Jan2015.fasta database with Protein Pilot v
5.0 software (AB Sciex). Details of this mass spectrometry method
are reported in Dafferner et al.6

In the second scheme, a targeted Product Ion method designed for
the aged soman adduct on peptide FGESAGAAS was used. The targeted
method was used to increase the sensitivity of detection. Details
of the method were based on the results from the rHuAChE control.
Product Ion data acquisition was performed on the singly charged mass
for the active site peptide labeled with aged soman in positive mode
(FGESAGAAS + 78 Da + H+ = 874.35 Da, where 78 Da is the
added mass for aged soman). A data acquisition cycle consisted of
two steps. An MS survey scan was made over a mass range of 400–900
Da with an accumulation time of 1000 ms. This was followed by a Product
Ion MSMS scan whenever the 874.35 Da parent ion appeared in the survey
scan. Data were analyzed with Peak View v 2.1 (AB SCIEX). An Extracted
Ion Chromatogram for the 874.35 Da mass was constructed from both
the mass spectral and MSMS fragmentation data.

Result
Hupresin
The Hupresin affinity ligand is based on a
derivative of the chemical huprine, which is a condensation product
of tacrine and huperzine-A. Huprine derivatives were synthesized by
French scientists who were searching for a new acetylcholinesterase
(AChE) inhibitor to use for treating Alzheimer’s disease.18 They synthesized dozens of derivatives and found
one, Hup-19, with characteristics suggesting it might work as an affinity
ligand. They cross-linked Hup-19 to Sepharose and purified recombinant
human butyrylcholinesterase expressed from insect cells to 90% purity
in a single step.19 Emilie David at the
CHEMFORASE company, Mont-Saint-Aignan, has made the Hupresin affinity
gel available for purchase in small and large quantities.

Binding and
Elution of No-Ghost RBC AChE from Hupresin
A 2 mL column
of Hupresin bound 94% of the AChE activity in 20 mL
of no-ghost RBC AChE in 0.6% Triton X-100, PBS. Hemoglobin and other
contaminating proteins easily passed through. Washing with 3 M NaCl
eluted an additional 10% of the original AChE activity. No reagent
was identified that released nondenatured, active AChE from Hupresin
in good yield. This is not a drawback for projects that aim to identify
adducts on the active site serine of AChE by mass spectrometry. The
denatured AChE was released from Hupresin with 1% trifluoroacetic
acid. Fractions that contained protein were identified by SDS gel
electrophoresis. Figure 1 shows that all five fractions
contained the same set of proteins. The most intense Coomassie blue
stained bands are in lane 2, representing the proteins in fraction
2. Bands at about 95 and 55 kDa were digested with trypsin and analyzed
by LC-MS/MS.13 Human AChE (P22303) was
the most abundant protein in both bands. Other proteins in these bands
were plasminogen (P00747), retinal dehydrogenase (P00352), actin (P63261),
spectrin (P02549) and hemoglobin beta (P68871). The control rHuAChE
in Figure 1 has a molecular
weight of 65 kDa. Reduced RBC AChE has a molecular weight of 75 kDa.11 It was concluded that RBC AChE was recovered
from Hupresin as a partially purified, denatured protein that comigrated
with other proteins on an SDS gel.

Figure 1 RBC AChE eluted off 2 mL Hupresin, visualized
on an SDS gel stained
with Coomassie blue. Lanes 1–5 show proteins in fractions 1–5.
The fractions were dried, dissolved in 50 μL of SDS/dithiothreitol
loading buffer, and 20 μL was loaded per lane. Truncated recombinant
human AChE Q552stop MW 65 kDa is in the last lane.

Detection of Soman Model Compound-Labeled
AChE
The
structure of the soman model compound that inhibited no-ghost RBC
AChE is shown in Figure 2. This model compound produced the same adduct on AChE as authentic
soman7,12 and aged to yield an added mass of 78 Da.
The structure of the aged soman adduct on the active site serine of
human AChE is in Figure 3.

Figure 2 Soman model compound (O-pinacolyl methylphosphonothiomethyl)
has a thiomethyl group in place of fluoride in authentic soman.

Figure 3 Soman model compound makes a covalent bond with
the active site
serine 203 of human AChE (P22303). The initial adduct has an added
mass of +162 Da that rapidly ages to a stable adduct with an added
mass of +78 Da and release of pinacolyl alcohol.

The fragmentation and elution properties of the soman-labeled
AChE
active site peptide (FGESAGAAS + 78 Da) were determined
in preliminary experiments with rHuAChE. Recombinant human AChE was
inhibited with soman Sp-thiomethyl and digested with
pepsin. Peptic peptides were introduced into the Triple TOF 6600 mass
spectrometer using a data dependent acquisition method and the results
analyzed by comparison with the Uniprot/Swissprot database. The singly
charged, active-site peptide containing the aged soman adduct with
a mass of 874.4 Da eluted at 15.3 min. The fragmentation spectrum
in Figure 4A confirms that the methylphosphonate adduct from aged
soman is attached to Ser4; fragment ions at 778.36, 673.31, and 602.27
Da are the most intense.

Figure 4 Fragmentation spectra
of parent ions 874.4 from 8 μg of soman-inhibited,
pepsin-digested rHuAChE in (A) and 0.007 μg from RBC AChE in
(B). The Δ symbol indicates ions that have lost methylphosphonate
and a molecule of water during collision-induced fragmentation. The
masses of internal fragment ions are consistent with β-elimination
of the aged soman adduct and a molecule of water.

Pepsin digestion of the soman-labeled
no-ghost RBC AChE also yielded
the nine residue active site peptide FGESAGAAS modified
on serine 4 with an added mass of +78 Da for the aged soman adduct.
Targeted analysis in the 6600 Triple TOF mass spectrometer showed
that the aged soman-labeled peptide eluted at 14.91 min, similar to
the standard peptide. As shown in Figure 4B the parent ion had a mass of 874.4 Da and
fragment ions at 778.3, 673.3, and 602.2 Da. The 874.4 Da mass is
consistent with the peptide sequence FGESAGAAS with an
added mass of 78. The fragment ions Δy9 (778.3), Δb8 (673.3),
and Δb7 (602.2) have lost the soman adduct plus a molecule of
water, thus converting the modified serine to dehydroalanine. It was
concluded that soman exposure was detected in RBC AChE after the soman-inhibited
no-ghost RBC AChE was partially purified on Hupresin.

Discussion
Rationale for Analyzing RBC AChE for Nerve
Agent Exposure
The physiologically important target for nerve
agent toxicity is
AChE in the nervous system. AChE in red blood cells does not function
in nerve impulse transmission, but it has the same reactivity with
nerve agents as AChE in the nervous system. When AChE in red blood
cells is inhibited more than 50% by a single dose of nerve agent,
humans show signs of toxicity.20 Repeated
exposure to sarin over a period of days can depress RBC AChE to near
zero without symptoms ensuing.21 RBC AChE
is a reliable surrogate for AChE in muscle.22

Red blood cells persist in the circulation with a half-life
of 33 days and a lifetime of 120 days.23 This suggests that exposure to nerve agents or other organophosphorus
toxicants may be detectable on RBC AChE in blood drawn weeks after
the exposure incident.

Antihuman AChE monoclonal antibodies
immobilized on Sepharose beads
can be used to enrich nerve-agent inhibited RBC AChE.6 Hupresin is less expensive than antibodies, works as well
as antibodies, and can be cleaned with 0.1 M NaOH and reused at least
7× without reducing binding capacity for no-ghost RBC AChE.13 This makes the commercially available Hupresin
a cost-effective reagent for enriching RBC AChE to be used for detection
of organophosphorus toxicant exposure including nerve agents and organophosphorus
pesticides.
