The
effects of different anions on the extent of electrothermal
supercharging of proteins from aqueous ammonium and sodium salt solutions
were investigated. Sulfate and hydrogen phosphate are the most effective
anions at producing high charge state protein ions from buffered aqueous
solution, whereas iodide and perchlorate are ineffective with electrothermal
supercharging. The propensity for these anions to produce high charge
state protein ions follows the following trend: sulfate > hydrogen
phosphate > thiocyanate > bicarbonate > chloride > formate
≈
bromide > acetate > iodide > perchlorate. This trend correlates
with
the reverse Hofmeister series over a wide range of salt concentrations
(1 mM to 2 M) and with several physical properties, including solvent
surface tension, anion viscosity B-coefficient, and anion surface/bulk
partitioning coefficient, all of which are related to the Hofmeister
series. The effectiveness of electrothermal supercharging does not
depend on bubble formation, either from thermal degradation of the
buffer or from coalescence of dissolved gas. These results provide
evidence that the effect of different ions in the formation of high
charge state ions by electrothermal supercharging is largely a result
of Hofmeister effects on protein stability leading to protein unfolding
in the heated ESI droplet.

Electrospray
ionization (ESI)
mass spectrometry (MS) is an important tool in protein chemistry and
structural biology, where it is commonly used to determine protein
expression levels, to identify post-translational or induced chemical
modifications,1−4 and to investigate higher order protein and protein complex structure
using a variety of techniques, such as hydrogen–deuterium exchange
(HDX)2,5−10 or photochemical oxidative labeling.5,11−13 In native MS,14,15 protein ions are formed from
buffered aqueous solutions that typically contain ammonium acetate
or ammonium bicarbonate under conditions in which the protein has
a native or native-like conformation and activity. Gaseous ions formed
from these solutions tend to have low charge and compact structures.
Analysis of these ions can provide valuable information about protein
complex stoichiometry,16−18 protein–ligand binding,19−21 and specific
changes to protein or protein complex structure in solution.22 In contrast, high charge state protein ions
are typically formed from solutions containing organic solvents and/or
acid in which the protein is unfolded. High charge state ions are
advantageous because they dissociate more efficiently to form structurally
useful fragments23−29 and can be detected more efficiently with charge sensitive detectors,
such as those in Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR)
and orbitrap mass spectrometers. Higher charge state ions typically
have fewer adducts, such as sodium and phosphate, which preferentially
adduct to low charge state ions.30−32 Unresolved adducts on
high mass protein or protein complexes can considerably broaden mass
spectral peaks, resulting in decreased sensitivity and reduced mass
measuring accuracy.33,34

High charge states can
be formed from buffered aqueous solutions
in which the protein is in a native-like conformation with supercharging
reagents, such as m-NBA or sulfolane.8,35−45 At low concentrations in the initial solution, supercharging reagents
do not measurably affect the structure of the protein, but their concentration
in the ESI droplet increases as droplet evaporation occurs, and at
high concentrations, these reagents chemically and/or thermally denature
proteins in the droplet, resulting in the formation of high charge
state protein ions.8,37−41 Other effects, such as droplet surface tension, also
play a role in supercharging from both native37,46 and denaturing46−48 solutions. Supercharging reagents are effective at
increasing the charge of intact noncovalent protein–protein
and protein–ligand complexes35,38−41 but can also induce dissociation of complexes in the ESI droplet.36,49

With a newly introduced electrothermal supercharging (ETS)
method,
ESI mass spectra can be rapidly and reversibly switched between native
and denaturing modes simply by changing the electrospray potential.50−52 With electrothermal supercharging, protein ions are produced by
ESI from aqueous buffers, typically ammonium bicarbonate (pH ∼7–8),
using relatively energetic source conditions. At low spray potentials
(∼0.8 kV), low charge-state distributions characteristic of
native MS are produced, but at high spray potentials (∼1.3
kV), bimodal distributions of charge states dominated by a high-charge
distribution are typically produced, where the maximum charge is similar
to or greater than that formed from denaturing solutions.51 From the high-charge ions generated during electrothermal
supercharging, it is possible to obtain sequence information in top-down
tandem MS experiments that is nearly identical to that obtained from
high charge state ions produced from denaturing solutions. Electron
transfer dissociation of cytochrome c 16+ ions produced
from denaturing solution and by ETS from native solution results in
the same sequence coverage, although there are some differences in
cleavage locations and fragment ion intensities, indicating that there
are subtle differences in the gas-phase conformations of the ions
formed by both methods.51

High charge
state ions in electrothermal supercharging appear to
be produced as a result of protein unfolding in the ESI droplet, which
is heated by the more energetic collisions with surrounding gas molecules
at high spray potentials and by the relatively high inlet capillary
temperatures used in these experiments.50,51 ETS is not
effective with pure water.50 Mirza and
Chait53 suggested that salt in an electrospray
solution may increase the ESI droplet lifetime, thereby allowing more
time for droplet heating and thermal denaturation of proteins to occur
in the heated inlet capillary region. However, different salts have
only a relatively minor effect on the vapor pressure of water. For
example, the vapor pressure of a 1 M sodium carbonate solution at
100 °C differs from pure water by only ∼3.6%. In addition,
ETS from solutions containing bicarbonate is significantly more effective
than from solutions containing acetate,50 yet the vapor pressures of 1 M sodium carbonate and 1 M sodium acetate
solutions at 100 °C differ by only ∼0.5%.54 Protein denaturation is well-known to occur at water–air
interfaces,55−58 such as that occurring at the droplet surface or at a bubble surface
if gaseous evolution occurs in the droplet. Konermann and co-workers52 recently reported that myoglobin aggregation
in heated ammonium bicarbonate solutions is a result of bubbles produced
by bicarbonate degradation to carbon dioxide, and they proposed that
formation of carbon dioxide gas bubbles during ESI droplet heating
may be the cause of protein unfolding in electrothermal supercharging
experiments.

The effects of various salts on protein structure
and stability
have been extensively investigated.59−63 Studies done over 125 years ago by Franz Hofmeister59 led to an ordering of anions and cations based
on their propensity to cause protein aggregation or denaturation that
is referred to as the Hofmeister series. The Hofmeister series depends
on protein identity and experimental conditions, but the ordering
of ions is typically: cations:
  anions:
 with kosmotropic ions toward
the right of
the series that tend to precipitate (salt-out) proteins from solution
and prevent protein unfolding and chaotropic ions toward the left
in the series that typically increase the solubility (salt-in) of
proteins and enhance protein denaturation. A reverse Hofmeister series
has been observed for some proteins at low salt concentrations when
the protein has a net positive charge in solution.64−70 Both the cation and the anion of a salt in solution contribute to
the stability of a protein, although anions tend to have a more significant
effect than cations.71 The detailed mechanism
on how ions affect protein structure is not well understood, but both
ion–protein and ion–water interactions have been implicated
in the phenomenon.60,61,69,72−76 Hofmeister effects are also associated with physical
properties of aqueous electrolyte solutions and solution-phase ionic
properties, such as surface tension,62,66,71,77 ion free energy of
hydration,66,78 viscosity B-coefficient,78 and ion surface/bulk partitioning.77,79,80 Colussi and co-workers81,82 reported a Hofmeister ordering of ion preference for the surface
of electrospray droplets from ion abundances even for submicromolar
salt solutions and found that the identity of the cation played a
very small role in determining the surface activities of anions. Ruotolo
and co-workers83 reported both a direct
Hofmeister series for anions and a reverse series for cations for
refolding of misfolded concanavalin A tetramer using both solution-phase
differential scanning calorimetry and ion mobility mass spectrometry.
Effects of anion adducts on gaseous protein conformations have also
been reported.84−86

Here, the role of the buffer in protein unfolding
in electrothermal
supercharging is investigated for ammonium and sodium salts with ten
different anions. The effectiveness of different anions at producing
electrothermal supercharging correlates well with a reverse Hofmeister
series and to several solution and anion properties related to the
Hofmeister series. Bubble formation upon heating does not occur appreciably
from most salt solutions for which electrothermal supercharging is
effective, and degassing of solutions of thermally stable salts prior
to electrospray has no effect on the protein ion charge-state distributions
in electrothermal supercharging. These results indicate that protein
unfolding in electrothermal supercharging is predominantly caused
by protein destabilization as a result of droplet heating and increasing
concentration of destabilizing anions in the ESI droplet, although
other factors almost certainly contribute as well.

Experimental
Section
Ions were formed by nanoelectrospray (nanoESI) from
solutions of
10 μM protein and 5 mM ammonium or sodium salts (≥97%
purity) using borosilicate capillaries (1.0 mm o.d./0.78 mm i.d.,
Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, USA) that were pulled to a tip i.d.
of ∼1 μm with a Flaming/Brown micropipet puller (Model
P-87, utter Instruments, Novato, CA, USA). All mass spectra were acquired
using a Thermo LTQ (Linear Trap Quadrupole) Orbitrap with the inlet
capillary heated to 250 °C. The nanoelectrospray emitter was
positioned ∼2 mm from the mass spectrometer inlet, and a spray
potential of +1.3 kV was used to induce electrothermal supercharging.
The temperature of the nanospray emitter was ∼35 °C, which
is well below the aqueous melting temperatures of the three proteins
studied (∼85 °C for cytochrome c,87 >100 °C for ubiquitin,88 and ∼82 °C for β-lactoglobulin A89) so that no unfolding of the protein should
occur in the nanospray emitter prior to droplet formation by ESI.
Spectra were measured in triplicate using three different nanospray
capillaries for each sample to account for tip-to-tip variability
in charge-state distributions. The fraction of the protein population
that is unfolded was calculated from the charge-state distribution,
with the peaks corresponding to the high-charge fraction of the bimodal
distribution assigned to unfolded conformations (≥10+ for cytochrome c, ≥7+ for ubiquitin, and ≥10+ for β-lactoglobulin
A).

Experiments in which bubble formation from different ammonium
salt
solutions was monitored over time were performed by inserting a rack
of test tubes containing 2 mL of 10 μM cytochrome c in each solution into a 97 °C water bath and recording the
results with a camera. Degassing of an ammonium sulfate buffer was
done by vacuum filtration through a 0.45 μm Type HA membrane
(Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), followed by gentle stirring with
a magnetic stir bar under vacuum for 10 min. Bovine cytochrome c, ubiquitin, and β-lactoglobulin A were purchased
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) as lyophilized solids and were used
without further purification.

Results and Discussion
Electrothermal Supercharging
with Aqueous Ammonium Salts
NanoESI mass spectra of 10 μM
bovine cytochrome c in aqueous solutions containing
5 mM ammonium salts under electrothermal
supercharging conditions are shown in Figure 1. Relatively low concentrations of ammonium salts were used to prevent
signal suppression due to the formation of salt cluster ions and acid
molecule adducts, the latter of which occur extensively for anions
with low proton affinities, such as perchlorate, hydrogen sulfate,
and iodide.90 The effectiveness of electrothermal
supercharging at producing a distribution of high charge state ions
varies significantly with the identity of the anion of the ammonium
salt (Figure 1, Table 1). Results for ammonium bicarbonate, which is advantageous due to
a buffer capacity centered near neutral pH and to its effectiveness
at ETS, is shown in Figure 1d. The charge-state
distribution is bimodal, with the 7+ through 9+ ions composing a low
charge-state distribution typical of cytochrome c formed in native ESI at low spray potential from ammonium bicarbonate
solutions (Figure S-1a, Supporting Information) and indicative of compact or folded structures. The 10+ to 20+
ions form a high charge-state distribution centered around the 15+
ion and correspond to cytochrome c that has unfolded
in the ESI droplet as a result of droplet heating at high spray potential.
The average charge of cytochrome c from the ammonium
bicarbonate solution is 13.5 ± 0.9+, and the fraction of the
ion population that is unfolded is 0.87 ± 0.06. In contrast,
no high charge state ions corresponding to unfolded protein are observed
at low spray potential (+0.7 kV; predominantly 8+ and 7+ charge states
formed; Figure S-1a, Supporting Information). The abundance of the high charge-state distribution with ETS is
even greater with sulfate, hydrogen phosphate, and thiocyanate than
it is with bicarbonate (Figure 1a–c,
Table 1). With sulfate, 100% of the ion population
is folded at low spray potential (Figure S-1b, Supporting Information), and at high spray potential, nearly
the entire charge-state distribution corresponds to unfolded protein
(∼99%).

Ammonium acetate is an acidic buffer with a buffer capacity around
∼pH 5, and it is by far the most commonly used buffer in native
MS. In contrast to results for sulfate, hydrogen phosphate, thiocyanate,
and bicarbonate, there is little electrothermal supercharging with
ammonium acetate (Figure 1h); the average charge
and fraction unfolded of cytochrome c from this solution
are 7.8 ± 0.1+ and 0.11 ± 0.02, respectively. Electrothermal
supercharging is even less effective with iodide and perchlorate (Figure 1i,j, Table 1), where no charge
states greater than 9+ are formed. The overall ranking of anions from
greatest to least amount of unfolding of cytochrome c by electrothermal supercharging is: sulfate > hydrogen phosphate
> thiocyanate > bicarbonate > chloride > formate ≈
bromide
> acetate > iodide = perchlorate.

The pI of bovine cytochrome c is 10.5, which is
well above the pH of all of the ammonium salt solutions used in these
experiments, so the protein has a net positive charge in these solutions.
Protein surface charge is an important factor in Hofmeister effects
on protein stability and solubility in electrolyte solutions.66,68,69,80,91,92 To determine
if protein surface charge is a factor in the effectiveness of these
anions in ETS, experiments with ubiquitin (pI 6.8), which has a pI
intermediate in the range of solution pH values, and β-lactoglobulin
A (pI 5.1), which has a pI below all of the pH values and thus would
have a net negative charge in the initial solutions, were performed.
The fraction of unfolded populations of these proteins is given in
Table 1. For ubiquitin, the ordering of the
efficiency of electrothermal supercharging with different anions is
the same as that for cytochrome c. The ranking of
anions for β-lactoglobulin A also follows the same order as
for cytochrome c, with the fraction unfolded decreasing
from sulfate to acetate, but reaches a minimum at acetate and increases
again from iodide to perchlorate. Iodide and perchlorate produce no
unfolding for cytochrome c (no high-charge ions for
either salt) and almost no unfolding for ubiquitin (0.12 ± 0.02
and 0.06 ± 0.03, respectively), but significant unfolding occurs
for β-lactoglobulin A (0.68 ± 0.27 and 0.94 ± 0.04,
respectively).

To investigate the effect of salt concentration
on the effectiveness
of electrothermal supercharging, ETS spectra for cytochrome c were measured as a function of salt concentration for
six different aqueous ammonium salts ranging from 1 mM to 2 M (Figure 2). The effectiveness of electrothermal supercharging
increases with salt concentration for all anions. With 100 mM or greater
salt concentration, all salts except acetate produce observable ETS
compared to water, and at these concentrations, all but acetate and
formate result in nearly 100% unfolding of cytochrome c with electrothermal supercharging. The ordering of anions in their
effectiveness at ETS of cytochrome c in 5 mM salt
solutions does not change over the entire range of salt concentrations
studied.

Figure 2 Fraction of the ion population corresponding to unfolded cytochrome c produced by electrothermal supercharging with different
concentrations of ammonium salts: ammonium hydrogen phosphate (black
□), thiocyanate (red ○), bicarbonate (green △),
bromide (blue ▽), formate (cyan ◇), and acetate (pink
⬠) and pure water (- - -).

The ordering of anions in their effectiveness at
ETS of ubiquitin
is slightly different than previously reported.50 In the previous study, the different ammonium buffers at
10 mM concentration were buffered to pH 7.0 using either acetic acid
or ammonium hydroxide, and the ordering of anions at their effectiveness
of electrothermal supercharging was: hydrogen phosphate (0.98 ±
0.01 of the population that is unfolded) > thiocyanate (0.95 ±
0.01) > bicarbonate (0.7 ± 0.2) > sulfate (0.6 ± 0.5)
>
perchlorate (no high-charge ions) ∼ acetate (no high-charge
ions). The effectiveness of electrothermal supercharging in pH-adjusted
solutions is a combined effect from both the cation and anion of the
ammonium salt in solution and the acetate or additional ammonium added
when the pH is adjusted. The buffer solutions used in this work were
not adjusted for pH. The pH values of these solutions are given in
Table 1 and range from 5.3 for ammonium sulfate,
chloride, and bromide to 8.2 for ammonium bicarbonate. There is no
correlation between the effectiveness of ETS and the solution pH,
i.e., a lower pH solution does not necessarily result in more unfolding
from electrothermal supercharging due to pH destabilization. Ammonium
sulfate and bromide solutions have the lowest pH of the salts at 5
mM concentration, yet these salts are near opposite ends of the ordering
of salts in their effectiveness at producing electrothermal supercharging.
Furthermore, increasing the salt concentration, and thus increasing
the buffering capacity of each solution to resist pH changes at some
point during ESI droplet evaporation, does not lead to any changes
in the ordering of anions in electrothermal supercharging and enhances
electrothermal supercharging for all salts.

Electrothermal Supercharging
with Aqueous Sodium Salts
To determine effects of the ammonium
cation on these results, mass
spectra with electrothermal supercharging conditions were obtained
from solutions containing 10 μM ubiquitin and 5 mM sodium salts.
The fraction of the ubiquitin population that is unfolded from these
sodium salt solutions (Table 2) is similar
to that for ubiquitin from ammonium salts (Table 1), with almost complete unfolding from sodium sulfate (0.87
± 0.01) and sodium hydrogen phosphate (0.98 ± 0.01) solutions
and minimal unfolding from sodium iodide (0.06 ± 0.01) and sodium
perchlorate (0.04 ± 0.02) solutions. Thiocyanate is an exception
where the fraction unfolded is 0.01 ± 0.01 with sodium as the
cation, the least unfolding among all of the sodium
salts, whereas the unfolded population is 0.69 ± 0.01 with ammonium
as the cation, the third most unfolding of the ammonium
salts. Overall, the similarities of these two data sets demonstrate
that, in most cases, the ammonium cation plays a relatively minor
role in the effectiveness of electrothermal supercharging.

Electrothermal
Supercharging, The Hofmeister Series, and Related
Physical Properties
The ordering of ions in the Hofmeister
series depends on the relative values of the protein pI and the solution
pH. Anions typically follow a direct Hofmeister ordering when a protein
has a net negative charge in solution, i.e., the protein pI is below
the solution pH. However, when the protein has a net positive charge
in solution, i.e., the protein pI is above the solution pH, anions
follow a reverse Hofmeister series at low salt concentrations (<0.3
M).64−69 The solution pH is known in these experiments prior to ESI droplet
formation, but droplet pH decreases during droplet evaporation.93−95 The ranking of salts in their effectiveness at electrothermal supercharging
correlates well with a reverse Hofmeister series. The most destabilizing
anions in the reverse Hofmeister series are sulfate and hydrogen phosphate,
and spectra from these ammonium and sodium salts have the most abundant
high charge states corresponding to the highest fraction of the population
that is unfolded from electrothermal supercharging. In contrast, the
most stabilizing anions in the series are iodide, perchlorate, and
thiocyanate, which produce the least unfolding from electrothermal
supercharging. This suggests that the effective ESI droplet pH may
be below the pI values of all three proteins prior to ion formation.
Results for sodium and ammonium acetate and ammonium but not sodium
thiocyanate do not follow the reverse Hofmeister series. Acetate is
a kosmotrope, which typically is intermediately between bicarbonate
and hydrogen phosphate in its ability to destabilize protein structure
in solution. Both of the latter anions are effective at ETS, but acetate
is not.

The ordering of salts from electrothermal supercharging
also correlates well with several physical properties related to the
ability of ions to structure water at an interface. The fraction of
ubiquitin that is unfolded in ETS in ammonium and sodium salts increases
with increasing solvent surface tension and anion viscosity B-coefficient
and decreases with increasing anion surface/bulk partitioning coefficient
(Figure 3). The increase in the surface tension
of water with ammonium and sodium salts is small (∼3% or less
at 1 M salt concentration). Although some increase in charge would
be expected due to the higher surface tension, this should be a small
effect and not the primary cause of the significant increase in protein
charging and bimodal charge-state distributions produced by ETS. Acetate
is an outlier in the correlation between electrothermal supercharging
and the reverse Hofmeister series, but it is not an exception in the
correlation between ETS and these three physical properties. Although
there is a correlation between the Hofmeister series and solution
surface tension as well as anion surface/bulk partitioning coefficients,
acetate is a known exception.77

of the ion population corresponding to unfolded ubiquitin
in electrothermal supercharging from aqueous ammonium and sodium salt
solutions as a function of (a) surface tension increment (relative
to pure water),54,101 (b) anion viscosity B-coefficient,102 and (c) anion surface/bulk partitioning coefficient
(with respect to sulfate at 0.0).77

An outlier to the trends in the
effectiveness of anions at ETS
with these three physical properties is ammonium thiocyanate (open
square, Figure 3), the same anion for which
the extent of unfolding from electrothermal supercharging depends
strongly on the cation identity. In contrast, data for sodium thiocyanate
(open triangle, Figure 3) follows the trend
established by the other anions. The ammonium cation is a stronger
kosmotrope than sodium, and it may have a greater effect on protein
stability than the chaotropic thiocyanate anion. In some instances,
the cation can have a significant effect on protein stability.96 For example, Tomé et al.96 reported that the solubility of l-valine in 1
M ammonium sulfate is 11% less than that in pure
water, whereas the solubility in 1 M magnesium sulfate is 10% greater than that in pure water. Thus, even though sulfate
itself is a strong kosmotrope, when magnesium is the counterion, salting-in
of a protein can occur with the sulfate anion.

The influence
of the ammonium cation as a kosmotrope may also be
responsible for anomalies in the β-lactoglobulin A data, in
which ammonium iodide and perchlorate produce much more unfolding
than expected on the basis of results for the other proteins. β-Lactoglobulin
A has a net negative charge in all of the salt solutions prior to
droplet formation, and the cations may associate more strongly with
the negative charges on the protein, enhancing their effect on protein
stability. Additionally, there could be a mixture of a direct and
a reverse Hofmeister series for β-lactoglobulin A under the
conditions in these electrothermal supercharging experiments. Although
only a direct Hofmeister series is typically observed for a negatively
charged protein, the solution pH in an ESI droplet decreases during
droplet evaporation,93−95 and the protein may have a net positive charge in
ESI droplets from some salt solutions and a net negative charge in
others.

At high salt concentrations (>0.3 M), anions typically
follow a
direct Hofmeister series irrespective of the protein pI relative to
the solution pH. Experiments by Verhac et al.97 show that, at both 500 mM and 1 M sodium salt concentrations, thiocyanate
anion decreases the melting temperature of cytochrome c by ∼20 °C compared to that in pure water, whereas phosphate
increases the melting temperature by ∼10 °C, in agreement
with a direct Hofmeister ordering. Our results indicate that anions
in electrothermal supercharging form a reverse Hofmeister series independent
of the initial salt concentration. This suggests that there are likely
factors in addition to the Hofmeister effect that contribute to the
effectiveness of electrothermal supercharging.

Electrothermal Supercharging
and Bubbles
Ammonium bicarbonate
in aqueous solutions can thermally degrade to produce carbon dioxide
gas, and Konermann and co-workers52 recently
proposed that protein denaturation at the surface of gas bubbles is
responsible for the high charge states formed by ETS from ammonium
bicarbonate solutions. In contrast, no bubbles are formed in heated
ammonium acetate solutions, where little or no ETS occurs. To determine
if the effectiveness of electrothermal supercharging depends significantly
on bubble formation, 2 mL solutions of 10 μM cytochrome c in water and in 1 M salts of ammonium perchlorate, acetate,
bicarbonate, hydrogen phosphate, and sulfate were inserted into a
97 °C water bath. Bubble evolution from each solution was recorded
for up to 31 s (Figure S-2, Supporting Information). The ammonium bicarbonate solution starts to bubble within a second,
and froth forms at the surface shortly thereafter due to protein aggregation.
No significant bubbling or frothing was observed for any other solution,
including ammonium hydrogen phosphate and sulfate solutions, for which
the most unfolding due to electrothermal supercharging occurs for
cytochrome c (Figure 1, Table 1).

It is possible that small bubbles may form
in electrospray droplets from the coalition of dissolved gas molecules.
A measure of the solubility of a gas in an aqueous electrolyte solution
is given by the Setschenow constant, kS, calculated from the following equation:  where C is the electrolyte
concentration, S is the solubility of the gas in
the aqueous electrolyte solution, and S′ is
the concentration of the gas in pure water. A Setschenow constant
less than one indicates a lower solubility of the gas in the electrolyte
solution compared to pure water. The Setschenow constants for nitrogen
and oxygen gas in aqueous sodium salt solutions are given in Table 3. The values of the Setschenow constants for both
gases closely follow the ordering of anions in the reverse Hofmeister
series (Table 3). The exception to this trend
is perchlorate for oxygen gas, which has a Setschenow constant between
that of chloride and sulfate, yet it is one of the most stabilizing
anions of the reverse Hofmeister series and produces little to no
electrothermal supercharging for ubiquitin and cytochrome c.

To test if dissolved gas is a potential cause of electrothermal
supercharging, a 5 mM ammonium sulfate solution was degassed by vacuum
filtration followed by gentle stirring with a stir bar under vacuum
for 10 min. Immediately after, a solution of 10 μM cytochrome c in this degassed ammonium sulfate solution was prepared,
and mass spectra under electrothermal supercharging conditions were
obtained (Figure S-3b, Supporting Information). The average charge and fraction unfolded of cytochrome c from this solution were 13.7+ and 0.99, respectively,
essentially identical to the result from a solution that was not degassed
(Table 1, Figure S-3a, Supporting Information). Bubble formation due to coalition
of dissolved gases or gas evolution as a result of thermal decomposition
of the buffer does not appear to play a significant role in electrothermal
supercharging.

Conclusions
Electrothermal supercharging
of proteins from aqueous solutions
containing different ammonium and sodium salts was investigated. The
effectiveness of ETS at producing high charge states depends strongly
on the identity of the anion, with an anion ordering that closely
follows a reverse Hofmeister series. This correlation with the Hofmeister
series and with several physical properties related to how strongly
ions influence water structure at an air/water or protein/water interface
indicate that stabilization or destabilization of proteins toward
thermal denaturation in the ESI droplet by these salts is likely a
primary mechanism for their relative effectiveness at electrothermal
supercharging. The few exceptions to the correlation in anion ordering
can be rationalized by cation effects, which in some cases can have
a large influence on protein stability and can change the position
of the anion in the Hofmeister series. No bubbles are formed from
heated ammonium sulfate and ammonium hydrogen phosphate solutions,
yet ETS is most effective with these salts. ETS is equally effective
from an ammonium sulfate solution that has been degassed. Both of
these results indicate that bubble formation from buffer decomposition
upon heating or from dissolved gases does not play a role in protein
unfolding in electrothermal supercharging. Hofmeister-like effects
may also play a role in other experiments in which protein unfolding
occurs in ESI droplets formed from native solutions, such as during
traditional supercharging with m-NBA or sulfolane,37−41 or in acid denaturation when acidic vapors are introduced in the
source of a mass spectrometer.98
