A method
was created on the basis of ultrafast affinity extraction
to determine both the dissociation rate constants and equilibrium
constants for drug–protein interactions in solution. Human
serum albumin (HSA), an important binding agent for many drugs in
blood, was used as both a model soluble protein and as an immobilized
binding agent in affinity microcolumns for the analysis of free drug
fractions. Several drugs were examined that are known to bind to HSA.
Various conditions to optimize in the use of ultrafast affinity extraction
for equilibrium and kinetic studies were considered, and several approaches
for these measurements were examined. The dissociation rate constants
obtained for soluble HSA with each drug gave good agreement with previous
rate constants reported for the same drugs or other solutes with comparable
affinities for HSA. The equilibrium constants that were determined
also showed good agreement with the literature. The results demonstrated
that ultrafast affinity extraction could be used as a rapid approach
to provide information on both the kinetics and thermodynamics of
a drug–protein interaction in solution. This approach could
be extended to other systems and should be valuable for high-throughput
drug screening or biointeraction studies.

==== Body
Studies of
the interactions
between drugs and serum proteins are important in providing information
regarding the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion
(ADME) of pharmaceutical agents within the body.1 Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most abundant transport
protein in blood (concentration of 30–50 g/L) and is of interest
in many drug–protein binding studies.2 This protein can interact with a large variety of drugs, most of
which bind to one or two major sites on HSA: Sudlow sites I and II.3−8 Examples of drugs and small solutes that can bind to this protein
include warfarin, azapropazone, benzodiazepines, indoles (e.g., l-tryptophan), sulfonylureas, and long-chain fatty acids.3−8

Many techniques have been used to examine the interactions
of drugs
and solutes with HSA. These techniques have included ultrafiltration,
equilibrium dialysis, fluorescence spectroscopy, capillary electrophoresis,
UV–vis spectroscopy, solid-phase microextraction, circular
dichroism, surface plasmon resonance, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,
and X-ray crystallography.9−15 High-performance affinity chromatography (HPAC) is another technique
that has been used to characterize these interactions. In HPAC, one
of the components of the interaction (e.g., HSA) is typically immobilized
to an HPLC support and used as the stationary phase within a column.
The other component (e.g., the drug or solute of interest) is then
injected onto the column or applied in the mobile phase while its
retention time, peak area or elution profile is monitored to obtain
information on this component’s interaction with the immobilized
binding agent.1,8,14

Several HPAC methods have previously been developed to measure
the equilibrium constants or rate constants for solute–protein
interactions. These approaches have included zonal elution and frontal
analysis for the determination of equilibrium constants and plate
height measurements, peak profiling, or peak decay analysis for kinetic
studies.14−17 One limitation of these past HPAC methods is that they require the
use of separate experiments or conditions for determining equilibrium
constants and rate constants.14,18−23 Also, these methods generally use an immobilized protein or binding
agent as one of the components of the interaction that is being examined.
This feature means proper validation with model systems and reference
methods are ideally required to ensure these HPAC approaches are providing
a satisfactory model of how the same protein or binding agent will
behave in its soluble or native state.18−23

An alternative HPAC method based on ultrafast affinity extraction
has recently been described for estimating the equilibrium constants
of drugs with HSA, or similar biological interactions, in solution.14,25,26 As illustrated in Figure 1, this method uses an affinity microcolumn that
contains an immobilized binding agent, such as an antibody or serum
protein, for extraction of the free (or nonprotein bound) fraction
of a drug or solute in a sample. If the sample residence time in the
column is sufficiently small to avoid appreciable release of the drug/solute
from proteins in the sample, the amount of extracted drug/solute can
then be used to measure the free fraction of this compound or the
equilibrium constant for binding by this drug or solute to a soluble
protein in the sample.25,26 This approach has been shown
to give equilibrium constants that are in good agreement with those
estimated for solution-phase systems when using ultrafiltration as
a reference method. In addition, this method requires only microliter-size
samples and provides binding data within a few minutes of injection.25,26

Figure 1 General
scheme for measuring a free drug fraction by ultrafast
affinity extraction. (a) A sample containing a drug/protein mixture
is injected onto an affinity microcolumn that contains an immobilized
binding agent for the drug, such as HSA. (b) As the sample passes
through the microcolumn at a suitably high flow rate, only the free
drug fraction will be extracted; this creates a separation of the
free and protein-bound forms of the drug in the sample and provides
data that can be used to estimate the association equilibrium constant
(Ka) or global affinity constant (nKa′) for the interaction. (c) If a slower
flow rate is used for sample injection, part of the protein-bound
fraction of the drug in the sample may dissociate as it passes through
the microcolumn, increasing the apparent free drug fraction; these
conditions provide data that can be used to estimate the dissociation
rate constant (kd) for the system.

In this study, a new method based
on ultrafast affinity extraction
is described in which both the rate constants and equilibrium constants
can be quickly determined for a drug–protein interaction in
solution. This work will use HSA as a model protein and will examine
several drugs that are known to bind to this protein.18−23 The theory of this approach will be described, and various experimental
parameters will be considered in the optimization of this technique.
This method will then be used to examine the interactions of each
tested drug with HSA, and the resulting rate constants and equilibrium
constants will be compared with those reported for other techniques.
The advantages and requirements of this method will be discussed,
as well as the possible extension of this approach to other systems
and applications.8,27

Experimental Section
Materials
and Reagents
The HSA (Cohn fraction V, essentially
fatty acid free, ≥96% pure), acetohexamide, chlorpromazine,
gliclazide, tolbutamide, racemic verapamil, and racemic warfarin were
obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.). The reagents for the
bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay were from Pierce (Rockford,
IL, U.S.A.). The Nucleosil Si-300 silica (7 μm particle diameter,
300 Å pore size) was purchased from Macherey Nagel (Dűren,
Germany). All buffers and aqueous solutions were prepared using water
from a Nanopure system (Barnstead, Dubuque, IA, U.S.A.) and were passed
through Osmonics 0.22 μm nylon filters from Fisher (Pittsburgh,
PA, U.S.A.)

Apparatus
The columns were packed
using a Prep 24 pump
from ChromTech (Apple Valley, MN, U.S.A.). The chromatographic system
consisted of a PU-2080 Plus pump, an AS-2057 autosampler, and a UV-2075
absorbance detector from Jasco (Easton, MD, U.S.A.). An Alltech water
jacket (Deerfield, IL, U.S.A.) and a Fisher Isotemp 3013D circulating
water bath were used to maintain a column temperature of 37.0 (±0.1)
°C during all experiments. ChromNAV v1.18.04 software and LCNet
from Jasco were used to control the system. Chromatograms were analyzed
through the use of PeakFit v4.12 software (Jandel Scientific, San
Rafael, CA, U.S.A.).

Column Preparation
The stationary
phase used in these
studies consisted of HSA immobilized onto Nucleosil Si-300 silica
by the Schiff base method.18 A control
support was prepared in the same manner but with no HSA being added
during the immobilization step. The protein content of the final HSA
support was determined in triplicate by a BCA assay using HSA as the
standard and the control support as the blank, giving a value of 65
(±2) mg HSA/g silica or an effective concentration of ∼440
μM HSA in the affinity microcolumns. The supports were placed
into stainless steel columns with an inner diameter of 2.1 mm and
lengths of 1 mm (using a frit-in-column design)28 or 5 to 10 mm (using traditional stainless steel HPLC housings
and end fittings). The packing solution was pH 7.4, 0.067 M potassium
phosphate buffer, and the packing pressure was 3000–4000 psi
(20–28 MPa). The columns were stored in pH 7.4, 0.067 M phosphate
buffer and at 4 °C when not in use.

Chromatographic Studies
The mobile phase used for sample
application, elution and sample preparation was pH 7.4, 0.067 M phosphate
buffer. All mobile phases were degassed for 30 min prior to use. Each
affinity microcolumn was used for approximately 200 sample injections
to provide optimum retention and peak resolution; however, these columns
were found to be stable for at least 300–400 injections and
over 6 months of use. The free fraction measurements were typically
made by injecting 1 μL of samples that contained 10 μM
of the desired drug or a mixture of 10 μM drug and 20 μM
soluble HSA, although other drug and protein concentrations were also
considered (see Supporting Information).
These mixtures were incubated for at least 30 min prior to injection,
with both the sample and mobile phase being preheated to 37 °C
before passage through the affinity microcolumn. Other conditions
are provided in the Supporting Information.

The dissociation rate constants and equilibrium constants
for each drug with soluble HSA were measured by using the general
scheme in Figure 1. For the direct measurement
of equilibrium constants, an injection flow rate was used that was
sufficiently high to minimize dissociation of drug–protein
complexes in the sample during their passage through the column. By
using lower flow rates, and longer residence times for the sample
in the column, the conditions were adjusted so that some of the drug–protein
complex could dissociate during passage through the column, thus increasing
the apparent free drug fraction and making it possible to determine
the dissociation rate constant for the drug with the soluble protein.
In both types of studies, the free drug fractions were measured by
dividing the drug’s baseline-corrected retained peak area by
the total peak area for the same drug in the absence of any soluble
protein. The baseline of each chromatogram was normalized using the
autofit and subtract baseline method of PeakFit 4.12 prior to data
analysis. No significant nonspecific binding with the control support
was seen for most drugs examined in this study.18−22 Some nonspecific binding was seen for verapamil,
as reported previously;21 however, this
nonspecific binding did not have any notable effect on the free fractions
that were measured for this drug with soluble HSA.

Results and Discussion
Optimization
of Free Drug Fraction Measurements
Several
model drugs were examined in this study. Warfarin is an anticoagulant
known to have single-site binding to HSA at Sudlow site I on this
protein.15,18,29,30 Verapamil is a calcium channel blocking agent, and
chlorpromazine is an antipsychotic drug that each have a primary binding
site at or near Sudlow site I.21,31 Tolbutamide, acetohexamide,
and gliclazide are sulfonylurea drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes
and have two major binding regions on HSA, which occur at Sudlow sites
I and II.19,20,22 The association
equilibrium constants (Ka, in the case
of single-site binding) or global affinity constants (nKa′, in the case of multisite binding) for these
drugs with HSA at 37 °C and pH 7.4 are in the general range of
104–106 M–1, as is
typical for the binding of many drugs with this protein.1,18−24 Dissociation rates from HSA have been examined previously by other
methods for four of these drugs (i.e., warfarin, verapamil, acetohexamide,
and tolbutamide),15,17 whereas the other two drugs (i.e.,
gliclazide and chlorpromazine) have not been the subject of prior
kinetic studies.

In this study, a drug was injected in either
the presence or absence of excess soluble HSA onto an HSA microcolumn
according to the scheme given in Figure 1.
As the sample passed through the microcolumn at a moderate-to-high
flow rate, the protein-bound fraction of the drug and the excess soluble
protein eluted as a nonretained peak, while the free fraction of the
drug was extracted, retained, and later eluted from the column. Some
typical chromatograms that were obtained with this method are provided
in the Supporting Information. Results
were obtained within 2–10 min for all of the tested drugs (depending
on the column size, degree of retention, and the flow rate) and within
2–6 min for drugs with low-to-moderate affinities for HSA.

The injected samples that were typically used in this study contained
a 2-fold mole excess of HSA versus each drug (i.e., 20 μM HSA
and 10 μM drug). These concentrations avoided the use of an
excess of drug versus protein in the samples and provided free drug
fractions that could be readily detected. It has been shown in prior
work with ultrafast affinity extraction that therapeutic levels of
similar drugs26,32,38 and larger concentrations of soluble HSA,26 including physiological levels, could be used in this type of experiment.
However, these latter conditions were not required for the purpose
of this current study. Samples containing other drug and/or protein
concentrations were also examined (see Supporting
Information), with no significant changes being noted in either
the rate constants or equilibrium constants that were measured under
these alternative conditions.

As shown in Figure 2, the relative size
of the free drug fraction was affected by the flow rate used for sample
injection. This effect has been noted for other applications of ultrafast
affinity extraction and was due to the change the flow rate created
in the time allowed for dissociation of the protein-bound form of
the drug as the sample passed through the column.25,26,32,38 The extraction
efficiency for the drug can also vary with the flow rate for some
types of affinity microcolumns, but this parameter was 95% or higher
for the HSA microcolumns and experimental conditions used in this
study25,26 and did not lead to any significant changes
in the relative size of the retained peaks as a function of flow rate.

Figure 2 Effect
of injection flow rate on the column residence time (dashed
line) and apparent free drug fractions (solid line) for 1 μL
samples of 10 μM tolbutamide and 20 μM soluble HSA injected
onto a 5 mm × 2.1 mm inner diameter (i.d.) HSA microcolumn at
pH 7.4 and 37 °C.

The overall effect of changing the flow rate and drug–protein
dissociation in the sample is also illustrated in Figure 2. At low-to-moderate flow rates (i.e., < 2.0
mL/min, in this example for a tolbutamide/HSA mixture), the apparent
free drug fraction increased with a decrease in the flow rate, due
to increased dissociation of the drug from soluble HSA as the sample
passed through the column. However, the measured free drug fraction
approached a constant value when the flow rate reached a certain critical
value (e.g., ≥ 2.0 mL/min, or a column residence time of ∼420
ms or less for the tolbutamide/HSA mixture). This effect was employed
by using the latter conditions and high flow rates to estimate the
original free drug fraction that was present at equilibrium in the
sample and lower flow rates to provide data on the rate of a drug’s
dissociation from a soluble protein in the sample.

Column size
is another factor to consider when performing a free
fraction analysis by ultrafast affinity extraction. Like flow rate,
this factor will affect the time allowed for drugs to dissociate from
proteins during passage of a sample through the column, following
the same trend as illustrated in Figure 2.
In addition, both the column size and flow rate will affect the backpressure
of the system (e.g., typical column pressures of 1.9–3.2 MPa
for 5–10 mm × 2.1 mm i.d. columns at 3.5 mL/min). However,
the column size will also affect the elution time of the retained
free drug fraction and the resolution of this peak from the nonretained
peak due to the protein-bound drug and excess protein in the sample.25

It was found that drugs with relatively
strong binding to HSA (e.g.,
warfarin, tolbutamide, and acetohexamide; affinities, ∼105–106 M–1)18−22,29,30 provided measurable free fractions when using relatively short 5
mm × 2.1 mm i.d. HSA microcolumns. Such columns not only gave
good retention for these drugs, but they made it easy to obtain short
column residence times for measurement of the small free drug fractions
that could occur in such systems. Most drugs with weaker binding to
HSA (e.g., gliclazide and verapamil; affinities, ∼104–105 M–1)21,22 were examined by using longer 10 mm × 2.1 mm HSA microcolumns.
These longer microcolumns provided higher drug retention while still
providing column residence times sufficient to examine the larger
free fractions that were present in such systems. An exception to
this trend was chlorpromazine, which had fast dissociation kinetics
and moderate binding to HSA.23 In this
specific case, a 1 mm × 2.1 mm i.d. HSA microcolumn was used.

Determination of Dissociation Rate Constants
Measurements
of the apparent free drug fractions at low-to-moderate flow rates
were used in this study to estimate the dissociation rate constant
for a drug with a soluble protein in the same sample. This experiment
was described by the reactions shown in eqs 1 and 2, which occurred simultaneously as a
mixture of the drug/analyte and soluble protein (as represented by
A and P, respectively) was applied to an affinity microcolumn that
contained an immobilized binding agent for the drug, P(s). 1   2  The reaction in eq 1 describes the binding and equilibrium that has taken place
between
A and P in the sample prior to entering the column, whereas eq 2 describes the binding and extraction of the free
form of A by the immobilized agent P(s) in the microcolumn. The terms ka and kd in eq 1 represent the second-order association rate constant
and first-order dissociation rate constant of A with P in solution.
The term ka(s) in eq 2 is the second-order association rate constant for A as it interacts
with the immobilized binding agent.

The system in eqs 1 and 2 was simplified in this
study by using a large excess of the immobilized binding agent versus
the soluble protein. For instance, the 1–10 mm × 2.1 mm
i.d. microcolumns contained a 76- to 760-fold larger HSA content than
a 1 μL solution of 20 μM HSA. In addition, each of these
columns had at least a 22-fold larger molar concentration of HSA than
was present in even the initial, undiluted samples and mixtures that
contained soluble HSA. These conditions meant that P(s) was present
in a large excess versus soluble P when using the model described
by using eqs 1 and 2.
This also meant that the pseudo-first order rate constant ka [P] for the binding of A with P was much less
than the pseudo-first-order rate constant ka(s) [P(s)] for the extraction of A (i.e., assuming ka and ka(s) had comparable
values, as has been noted to be the case for soluble HSA and the type
of immobilized HSA used in this study).1,29,39

The result of these experimental conditions
is that the extraction
of A by the immobilized binding agent was much faster than the association
of A with P. This, in turn, made it possible to ignore this latter
process and simplify the reaction in eq 1 to
that shown in eq 3. 3  It was then possible with this revised model
to obtain the integrated rate expressions given in eqs 4 and 5 (see Supporting
Information for derivations). 4   5  In
these equations, F0 is the original free
fraction of A in the sample, and Ft is
the apparent free fraction after AP has
been allowed to dissociate for time t. The value
of t is equal to the column void time and can be
calculated by employing the flow rate and the column void volume (e.g.,
as found by using the known support porosity, packing density, and
column size). Equations 4 and 5 indicate that a plot of either ln[(1 – F0)/(1 – Ft)] or ln[1/(1 – Ft)] versus t should provide, under the appropriate
experimental conditions, a linear relationship in which the slope
is directly related to the dissociation rate constant kd as A is released from its complex with soluble agent
P in the sample.

Some typical plots that were obtained when
using eqs 4 and 5 are
provided in Figure 3. Both types of plots gave
a linear response for
all of the tested drugs, with correlation coefficients ranging from
0.988 to 0.998 (n = 5 to 8) over dissociation times
that allowed measurable changes to be made in the apparent free fractions.
The plots that were prepared according eq 4 gave
intercepts that were essentially equal to zero, regardless of whether
an experimental point at t = 0 and Ft = F0 for the original sample
was included in the data set. For plots made according to eq 5, a positive nonzero intercept was obtained that
was related to the value of F0.

Figure 3 Measurement
of the dissociation rate constant for verapamil and
soluble HSA at pH 7.4 and 37 °C, as determined by measuring apparent
free drug fractions using ultrafast affinity extraction. The samples
contained 10 μM verapamil and 20 μM soluble HSA. The results
were analyzed by using (a) eq 4 or (b) eq 5. The solid line in (a) shows the result that was
obtained when a point at the origin was included (◊), and the
dashed line shows the result obtained when this point was not included;
the equations for these two best-fit lines were y = 0.35 (±0.02) x – 0.04 (±0.06)
and y = 0.36 (±0.02) x –
0.06 (±0.09), respectively. In (b), the best-fit equation was y = 0.36 (±0.02) x + 1.51 (±0.09).
The correlation coefficients for these plots ranged from 0.993 to
0.995 (n = 5−6). The error bars represent
a range of ±1 SD and, in some cases, were comparable in size
to the data symbols.

The usable time range for these dissociation studies was
dependent
on the affinity of each drug for soluble HSA (which affected the value
of F0) and the dissociation rate for the
soluble drug–protein complex. The lower end of this usable
time range occurred when the free fraction grew close to its equilibrium
value (i.e., conditions under which little dissociation occurred).
These times were as low as 100–277 ms for chlorpromazine or
warfarin and as high as 950 ms for verapamil. The ranking of these
drugs with respect to this time was correlated with a decreasing order
in the overall affinities of the drugs for HSA, with the sole exception
of chlorpromazine due to its relatively high dissociation rate. The
upper end of the usable time range occurred when the drug had sufficient
time to reach essentially complete dissociation. For most of the tested
drugs, this upper limit occurred over the range of 1.7–6.7
s and, again with the exception of chlorpromazine, followed approximately
the same order as seen with the lower time limits for these drugs
and the affinities of these drugs for soluble HSA.

Table 1 summarizes the kd values
that were obtained in this study. The relative
precision of these dissociation rate constants ranged from ±3–9%.
The measured kd values differed by only
7–20% from the literature values that have been reported for
acetohexamide, tolbutamide, and racemic verapamil.15,17 In the case of warfarin, for which several literature values were
available,9,15,40 the results
of this study fell within the overall range of all previously reported
values for racemic warfarin or its enantiomers. Although gliclazide
and chlorpromazine did not have prior kd values that have been reported, the dissociation rate constants
measured for these drugs did fit within the range that would be expected
for drugs with similar affinities to HSA.15,17,41,42 The same trends
were seen for kd values that were measured
by ultrafast affinity extraction (1) when a point at the intercept,
and representing the original sample, was included during analysis
of the data by using eq 4; (2) when eq 4 was used with no such point being included in the
data set; or (3) when the data were examined by using eq 5.

samples contained 10 μM of the drug and 20 μM of HSA.
The values in the parentheses represent a range of ±1 SD, as
determined from the slopes of the best-fit lines constructed according
to eqs 4 and 5.

b These values were found by using
eq 4 when a point at the origin was included
in the data set.

Measurement
of Association Equilibrium Constants
It
was also possible to use ultrafast affinity extraction to obtain the
association equilibrium constant (Ka),
or the global affinity constant (nKa′)
in the case of a system with multisite binding,1,24 for
each drug with soluble HSA. For instance, eq 6 can be used for this purpose by employing the free drug fraction
that is measured for a drug/protein mixture at equilibrium (F0) and under injection conditions that minimize
release of the drug from soluble proteins as the sample passes through
the column.25 6  In eq 6, [A]tot and
[P]tot are the total concentrations of the drug and
soluble protein in the original sample, respectively. This equation
was derived for a drug and protein interaction that involves 1:1 binding,
but the same expression can be used to estimate the global affinity
constant for a multisite drug–protein interaction under a given
set of concentration conditions.25,32,35,37

The Ka (or nKa′) values
that were obtained by using direct measurements of F0 are provided in Table 2. These
values had precisions of ±7–36% and differed by less than
7% for the drugs with single reference values obtained under similar
temperature conditions. In the case of warfarin, the measured Ka fell within the range of previously reported
values. A second method for estimating Ka was carried out that utilized the value of F0 that was obtained from the intercept of a plot made according
eq 5 during the determination of dissociation
rate constants. This second set of values, which are also given in
Table 2, had precisions of ±8–22%
and differed from the literature results by less than 23% or, in the
case of warfarin, were similar to the range of previously reported
values.

of ±1 S.D., as determined by error propagation.

b The global affinity constants for
these drugs were calculated from data in the given references.

c This value represents the average
association equilibrium constant for R- and S-verapamil at their high affinity site on HSA.

A comparison of these two approaches
indicates that there are distinct
advantages to each method for measuring the equilibrium constant for
a drug–protein interaction. As the data in Table 2 suggest, the approach that uses fast flow rates and ultrafast
affinity extraction to directly measure F0 can provide the more precise estimate of Ka or nKa′. However, this
method does require obtaining appropriate flow rate conditions for
such a measurement and is carried out at separate flow rates from
those that would be used to measure a dissociation rate constant.
The second approach, in which the value of F0 is obtained from the intercept of a plot made according to
eq 5, provides a slightly less precise estimate
of the equilibrium constant but can be carried out with the same experiments
and conditions as those used to find kd. This makes the latter method attractive for the simultaneous and
rapid determination of both kd and Ka. This approach would also be useful for the
estimation of equilibrium constants at column pressures or peak resolutions
that may prevent the use of sufficiently high flow rates for the direct
determination of F0 and Ka.

Estimation of Association Rate Constants
It was possible
from the measured Ka and kd values to also estimate the second-order association
rate constant (ka) for each drug with
soluble HSA, as found by using the relationship ka = kdKa (see Supporting Information).
This method provided the actual ka value
for a drug–protein system with 1:1 interactions or the net,
apparent value of ka for a system with
multisite interactions. The average ka for racemic warfarin that was determined by this approach was 1.7
(±0.3) × 105 M–1 s–1 at pH 7.4 and 37 °C, which gave good agreement with prior values
reported for this drug with HSA.9,15,40,43 The association rate constants
for tolbutamide, acetohexamide, and racemic verapamil gave ka values of 6.4 (±2.4) × 104 M–1 s–1, 1.1 (±0.3) ×
105 M–1 s–1, and 5.4
(±1.5) × 103 M–1 s–1, respectively, which were comparable to the results calculated from
previously reported kd and Ka or nKa′ values for
these systems.15,17,19−21 Gliclazide and chlorpromazine gave ka values of 4.7 (±0.5) × 104 M–1 s–1 and 2.1 (±0.3) ×
105 M–1 s–1, which
agreed with the range of values that have been reported for drugs
with comparable affinities and dissociation rates for HSA.15,17,41,42

Conclusion
In this report, a new method based on ultrafast
affinity extraction
and affinity microcolumns containing immobilized HSA was developed
and used to measure both the rate constants and equilibrium constants
for drug–protein interactions involving soluble HSA. The effects
of column size and flow rate were considered in these experiments,
and several approaches for these measurements were examined and compared.
The dissociation rate constants obtained by this approach gave good
agreement with previous rate constants that have been reported for
the same drugs or for other solutes with comparable affinities for
HSA. The equilibrium constants determined by this method also showed
good agreement with the literature.

The results indicated that
ultrafast affinity extraction can be
an effective method for studying both the kinetics and thermodynamics
of a drug–protein interaction in solution. An important advantage
of this method is it can directly examine both the equilibrium processes
and interaction rates that occur between a drug and the soluble form
of a protein, thus avoiding any effects immobilization may have on
such interactions.18−23 The moderate-to-high flow rates and small columns used in this method
make this technique fast, with analysis times on the order of minutes
per sample being possible.25,26 In addition, this approach
is not limited to HSA or the drugs examined in this study but could
be applied to other systems (e.g., the interactions of drugs or small
biomolecules with other soluble proteins or to surface receptors on
injected particles). Possible applications for this method include
the high-throughput screening of drug candidates and the rapid characterization
of solute–protein interactions.1,9,14,17,24
