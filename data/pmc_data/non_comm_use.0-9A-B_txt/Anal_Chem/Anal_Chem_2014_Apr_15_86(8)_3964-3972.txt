The interpretation of NMR spectroscopic
information for structure
elucidation involves decoding of complex resonance patterns that contain
valuable molecular information (δ and J), which
is not readily accessible otherwise. We introduce a new concept of
2D-NMR barcoding that uses clusters of fingerprint signals and their
spatial relationships in the δ−δ coordinate space
to facilitate the chemical identification of complex mixtures. Similar
to widely used general barcoding technology, the structural information
of individual compounds is encoded as a specifics pattern of their
C,H correlation signals. Software-based recognition of these patterns
enables the structural identification of the compounds and their discrimination
in mixtures. Using the triterpenes from various Actaea (syn. Cimicifuga) species as a test case, heteronuclear
multiple-bond correlation (HMBC) barcodes were generated on the basis
of their structural subtypes from a statistical investigation of their
δH and δC data in the literature.
These reference barcodes allowed in silico identification of known
triterpenes in enriched fractions obtained from an extract of A. racemosa (black cohosh). After dereplication, a differential
analysis of heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) spectra
even allowed for the discovery of a new triterpene. The 2D barcoding
concept has potential application in a natural product discovery project,
allowing for the rapid dereplication of known compounds and as a tool
in the search for structural novelty within compound classes with
established barcodes.

NMR spectroscopy
has been used
not only routinely in structural elucidation of organic compounds,
but also increasingly in qualitative and quantitative analysis of
complex mixtures, such as combinatorial libraries,1,2 plant
metabolomes,3−5 and physiological fluids.6−8 Interpretation
of their NMR spectra, particularly when analyzing metabolomic samples,
is usually challenging due to spectral complexity. While it might
represent hidden information, the unique structure of a single chemical
entity is still represented by a distinctive albeit overlapping pattern
of NMR signals. In fact, these characteristic resonances can be used
as fingerprints to facilitate a rapid and accurate identification
of different chemical species.9

Moreover,
our previous studies have developed 1H iterative
Full Spin Analysis (HiFSA) methodology which reproduces the experimental 1H NMR spectra by an iterative QM-based approach.10−13 HiFSA uses a combination of spectral simulation and iterative permutation
of starting values from experimental 1H NMR spectra to
generate universal, tabulated data consisting of full sets of 1H NMR spin parameters, i.e., all chemical shifts (δ)
and coupling constants (J). This produces highly
characteristic HiFSA fingerprints for in silico identification and
quantification of the target analytes, including those in complex
mixtures. Much like biometric recognition, a small portion of these
fingerprints can be sufficient to distinguish different chemical species.
The identification of individual components in a mixture can then
be focused on the more characteristic but less complicated subregions
of the NMR spectra. This concept was recently demonstrated with the
development of ActaPredict, a computational tool which utilizes only
the easily accessible 1H NMR signals of skeletal methyls
as structural identifiers of the nearly 200 known, closely related
cycloartane triterpenes from Actaea.14 This approach also exhibited high efficiency and accuracy
in the chemical identification for moderately complex mixtures.

As both HiFSA and ActaPredict are based on an analysis of 1D 1H NMR spectra, the 1D approach may become less efficient when
analyzing increasingly complex mixtures. In such a situation, 2D-NMR
spectra can be more powerful in that they provide improved peak resolution
via 2D chemical shift and/or signal dispersion.15,16

The present study introduces the methodology of 2D-NMR barcoding
for the accelerated chemical identification of components in complex
mixtures. The barcoding concept has been implemented previously using
Raman spectroscopy for the classification and identification of complex
biological materials.17−19 These techniques have employed 1D binary barcodes
to highlight the Raman shift fingerprints of each sample. In the present
study, matrix (2D) barcodes were used to represent the characteristic
patterns produced by the fingerprinting cross-peaks in the 2D-NMR
spectra of each analyte. This approach adopts the theory of a popular
2D barcode technique that uses a variety of symbols, such as dots
and rectangles in two dimensions, to represent the data relating to
a specific object. Similarly, we hypothesize that the combination
of cross peaks and their spatial patterns in the 2D-NMR spectra can
be regarded as “chemical barcodes” which can be scanned
in silico, recognized, and decoded to the structures of chemical substances.
As an extension of the previously described methyl-based approach,14 the present study continues to use the Actaea cycloartane triterpenes as the model compounds to
validate the concept of 2D-NMR barcoding. Initially, the 2D heteronuclear
multiple-bond correlation (HMBC) barcodes for each type of the Actaea triterpenes were generated from an analysis of their
spectral data found in the literature. On the basis of these barcodes,
a VBA macro was written within Microsoft Excel that enables the reading
and deciphering of the 2D HMBC barcodes. This in silico tool allowed
efficient dereplication of the known triterpenes in complex fractions
of A. racemosa (black cohosh).

With the aim
of searching for new compounds, the present study
also employed an NMR-based method that virtually separates the compounds
from the complex mixtures by a differential analysis of their heteronuclear
single-quantum correlation (HSQC) spectra. Combined with HMBC barcoding,
both known and unknown triterpenes were accurately identified from
their mixtures without the need for repetitive purification. Combined
with cryo-microprobe NMR technology, this provides a powerful toolset
for the identification of both minor and difficult-to-separate compounds
from complex metabolomic samples.

Experimental Section
Samples
and Sample Preparation
Two triterpene-enriched
samples, A and B, were acquired by VLC fractionation of the EtOAc
extracts of black cohosh (Actaea racemosa roots and
rhizomes) as described in S1 of the Supporting
Information. Prior to NMR analysis, the samples were desiccated
over anhydrous CaSO4 in vacuo to eliminate chemical shift
variations resulting from differences in residual water content.

Mining, Acquisition, and Barcoding of the NMR Data
Initially,
an extensive literature survey was conducted to locate
and mine the NMR data of known Actaea triterpenes,
including their δH for H-26/27 and δC for C-24/25. These NMR data from the literature, associated with
other information pertaining to the compound including common names,
systematic names, structural types, and biogenetic sources, were then
entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (see S4, Supporting Information). Details of the in-house data acquisition
are described in S6, Supporting Information. The spectral barcoding was based on a virtual HMBC spectrum generated
by averaging the δH and δC values
of the corresponding nuclei in all known triterpenes of a particular
structural subtype. Thus, the characteristic correlations in the virtual
HMBC spectra, which include 3JH-26,C-24, 2JH-26,C-25, 3JH-27,C-24, and 2JH-27,C-25, were used as reference barcodes for both manual and in silico identification.

Matching of the Correlation Patterns
The matching of
the correlation patterns to the reference barcodes was carried out
by visual comparison between the investigative and reference spectra.
This procedure was automated with a Visual Basic for Applications
7.0 in Microsoft Excel 2010 (S7 and S8, Supporting
Information).

Results and Discussion
Selection of NMR Experiments
In principle, due to their
dimensionality, any type of 2D NMR experiment can be used for the
barcoding of target analytes for chemical identification. In practice,
however, the appropriate NMR spectra should be selected on the basis
of the following four factors: (i) the structural characteristics
of the target analytes; (ii) the chemical complexity of the target
samples; (iii) the ease of spectral acquisition and barcoding; and
(iv) the uniformity of the NMR solvents. Regarding the last point,
as chemical shift variations are counterproductive, the data should
be acquired not only uniformly but also as much as possible in commonly
used NMR solvents. For small molecules with relatively simple proton
spin systems, 1D 1H NMR spectra can be the general first
choice because of the relative ease of spectral acquisition and interpretation.
However, the additional signal dispersion of 2D NMR spectra can be
required when analyzing complicated spin systems (including small
molecules containing magnetically nonequivalent protons and/or elements
of coupling asymmetry) or larger molecules with isochronic spins such
as peptides, carbohydrates, glycosides, or even macromolecules. In
addition, analysis of mixtures or residually complex samples20 (see also http://go.uic.edu/residualcomplexity) such as reference materials can benefit from the 2D approach. Final
consideration of most suitable experiments for NMR barcoding relate
to sample quantity and available NMR instrumentation. Recent developments
in high sensitivity probe technology, e.g., cryo- and/or microprobes,
have dramatically improved NMR detection sensitivity, thus reducing
data collection times and making the acquisition of 2D NMR data of
mass-limited samples much more efficient.21,22

As recently established,14 the Actaea triterpenes can be divided into several subtypes
based on their structural skeletons (S2 and S3, Supporting Information). All consist of the same type of pentacyclic
core but differ in the side chain at C-17, which is often biosynthetically
cyclized via oxygens located at C-16 to C-23, C-24, and/or C-25. As
a result of these structural characteristics, the high field region
of the 1H NMR spectra (0.0–2.0 ppm) of individual Actaea triterpenes is already complex, exhibiting close
similarities for the methylene and methine protons of the pentacyclic
core. While subtle differences exist, the signals of these protons
are less intense (highly coupled) and severely overlapped due to the
underlying convoluted spin systems. By comparison, most of the methyl
signals in this region of the spectrum are singlets with much greater
resolution and intensities and are, thus, more suitable for use in
1D fingerprinting. By using these signals as descriptors, our previous
studies have developed a decision tree model that enabled structural
classification of the Actaea triterpenes.14 The results showed that, among the skeletal
methyl groups, CH3-26 and CH3-27 are highly
significant and accessible structural indicators.

However, in
addition to the methyl signals, substantial differences
can also be observed for the signals of the methylene and methine
protons of the side chains. Owing to the deshielding effects of the
neighboring oxygens, the chemical shifts of these protons appear at
lower fields (5.0–3.0 ppm), where signals are more dispersed.
Similarly, the signals of the characteristic carbons of the side chains,
i.e., C-23, C-24, and C-25, appear at lower field in the 13C NMR spectra (50–90 ppm) and can help differentiate the structures
of the side chains. Despite these dispersive characteristics, the
use of only 1D 1H or 13C NMR spectra is often
insufficient to resolve the chemical complexity of triterpene mixtures
and identify individual components with certainty. In comparison,
2D HMBC spectra are more effective in this task, e.g., when building
on correlations between the methyl protons of CH3-26/CH3-27 and their proximal carbons C-25/C-24. Compared with the
1D NMR signals of these characteristic protons and carbons, their
correlations in the 2D HMBC spectra provide a greater degree of certainty
for structural identification. Even more importantly for the aim of
barcoding, an added advantage of the use of such HMBC correlations
is that the methyl signals have greater intensity, while the signals
of the carbons have greater dispersion. This makes the 2D HMBC experiment
particularly suitable for the barcoding analysis of minor components
in complex mixtures.

Generation and Use of HMBC Barcodes
In widely adopted
earlier barcoding technology, barcodes are used to represent data
by varying the widths and spacings of parallel lines which are referred
to as linear or one-dimensional. More recently, barcodes have evolved
into two dimensions using rectangles, dots, hexagons, and other geometric
patterns, allowing the encoding of additional information. On the
basis of this technique, e.g., molecular biology has developed the
taxonomic method of DNA barcoding, which utilizes short genetic markers
in an organism’s DNA to identify biological species and subspecies. In the present study, we are applying a
similar approach to spectral analysis to perform structural identification
of chemical species. The basic concept is that the
spectral signals and their topological patterns are reconstructed
into reference barcodes that represent the 2D or 3D structures of
their respective chemical species. These barcodes can then be used
to aid the in silico translation of the investigative spectra into
the human-readable format as either the names or images of the chemical
identities.

After the HMBC had been selected as the appropriate
NMR experiment, the next step was to determine which signals and what
patterns of these signals are to be used for barcoding of the corresponding
compounds. In the HMBC spectra of Actaea triterpenes,
both methyl signals of CH3-26 and CH3-27 show
correlations to their proximal carbons C-25 and C-24. This results
in four HMBC correlations, i.e., 3JH-26,C-24, 2JH-26,C-25, 3JH-27,C-24, and 2JH-27,C-25, which altogether produce a rectangular
pattern with the four cross-peaks as the four vertices. These rectangular
HMBC patterns are differentiated by their widths (ΔδC and ΔδH) and spacings (δH and δC). Thus, each of these specific patterns
can be assigned a unique “HMBC barcode” which represents
a specific type of Actaea triterpene. Practically
speaking, recognition of these HMBC barcodes identifies the presence
of related chemical species.

Next, the reference HMBC barcodes
that represent each type of Actaea triterpene (Table 1) were
generated by a comparative analysis of the NMR data of purified reference
compounds. The data sets of 1H and 13C NMR spectra
of approximately 150 known Actaea triterpenes of
10 structural subtypes, predominantly measured in pyridine-d5, were initially collected in an in-house database
(S4, Supporting Information). For the triterpenes
in each subtype, the standard deviations (σ) of δH-26 and δH-27 were within the
range of 0.01–0.10 ppm (S5, Supporting
Information), indicating a small variance in the chemical shifts
of these two methyl protons. A small variation was also observed for
δC-24 and δC-25, showing
a σ of 0.1–2.0 ppm. Accordingly, using the average values
of δH and δC, a virtual HMBC spectrum
containing only the characteristic correlations could be constructed
to generate reference barcodes for each structural subtype of the Actaea triterpenes (Figure 1). Each
of these barcodes consists of a cluster of cross peaks which form
distinct lines and/or rectangular patterns that can be readily recognized.

workflow of 2D NMR barcoding. S1: The 2D NMR data of
reference compounds are statistically analyzed to generate a virtual
spectrum, representing a particular type of structure. S2: The distribution
and correlation patterns of signals in the virtual 2D NMR spectrum

Table 1 The Reference
HMBC Barcodes for the
Ten Principal Types of Actaea Triterpenes
a The HMBC cross-peaks were denoted
by the corresponding 1H–13C correlations
and discriminated by their spatial locations in the δH–δC coordinate of the HMBC spectrum, using
the average δH and δC values listed
in S4, Supporting Information.

According to these reference barcodes,
the particular types of Actaea triterpenes may already
be identified by a visual
inspection of their 2D HMBC spectra. In addition, a VBA program named
NMR Barcode Reader was developed within Microsoft Excel (S7 and S8, Supporting Information) to facilitate the automated
batch identification of the more complex samples. After processing
and peak picking in any third-party NMR processing software, the 2D
HMBC spectrum can be saved or exported as a delimited text file in
the format of CSV or TSV, consisting of two columns which are the
δH and δC values of the cross-peaks.
Upon loading this file in the Excel spreadsheet, the VBA program searches
and locates the line and rectangular patterns of the correlations
(investigative barcodes) in the peak listing of the 2D HMBC spectrum.
Finally, these candidate patterns are matched with the reference barcodes
by comparing their shape similarity and spatial locations in the δH–δC coordinate.

Chemical Identification
by HMBC Barcoding
The reference
HMBC barcodes were used to analyze the chemical constituents of two
complex mixtures of Actaea triterpenes, which were
generated by chromatographic fractionation of black cohosh extracts
(S1, Supporting Information). As these
two samples exhibited significant chemical complexity, containing
at least five triterpene components of different aglycone types, it
was rather challenging to identify their structures by a full interpretation
of the 1D/2D NMR spectra. In such a situation, the recognition of
barcodes as specific 2D NMR correlation patterns simplified the spectral
analysis and led to a much more rapid chemical identification. As
shown in Figure 2A, the doublet 1H signals of the cyclopropane methylene protons (H-19), resonating
in the range of δH 1.00–0.20, indicated the
presence of five Actaea triterpenes in sample A.
Upon the acquisition of the HMBC spectrum, the chemical identification
was carried out by the in silico search of the specific correlations
based on the reference HMBC barcodes. As a result, five investigative
barcodes were located in the HMBC spectrum (Figure 2C). By comparison with the reference barcodes (Table 2), these patterns were identified as belonging to
(24R,25S)-24,25-epoxy-(26S)-26-hydroxyacta-(16S,23R)-16,23;23,26-binoxoside (commonly known as
26β-hydroxyacteol, 1), (24R,25S)-24,25-epoxy-(26R)-26-hydroxyacta-(16S,23R)-16,23;23,26-binoxoside
(26α-hydroxyacteol, 2), (23R)-23-acetoxy-(24S)-24,25-epoxy-(15R)-15-hydroxy-16-oxoactanoside
(23-O-acetylshengmanol, 3), (15R)-15,25-dihydroxyacta-(16S,23R,24R)-16,23;16,24-binoxoside
(24-epi-cimigenol, 4), and (24S)-24-acetoxy-(15R,16R)-15,16,25-trihydroxyacta-(23R)-16,23-monoxoside (hydroshengmanol, 5).

Figure 2 The triterpene components in sample A were identified by matching
their HMBC correlations with the reference HMBC barcodes. (A) The 1H NMR signals of cyclopropane methylene protons indicated
the significant (residual) chemical complexity of sample A, containing
at least five Actaea triterpenes. (B) The HMBC spectrum
of sample A was acquired and used for chemical identification. (C)
By matching with the reference HMBC barcodes, these five Actaea triterpenes were identified as: (24R,25S)-24,25-epoxy-(26S)-26-hydroxyacta-(16S,23R)-16,23;23,26-binoxoside
(26β-hydroxyacteol, 1), (24R,25S)-24,25-epoxy-(26R)-26-hydroxyacta-(16S,23R)-16,23;23,26-binoxoside (26α-hydroxyacteol, 2), (23R)-23-acetoxy-(24S)-24,25-epoxy-(15R)-15-hydroxy-16-oxoactanoside
(23-O-acetylshengmanol, 3), (15R)-15,25-dihydroxyacta-(16S,23R,24R)-16,23;16,24-binoxoside
(24-epi-cimigenol, 4), and (24S)-24-acetoxy-(15R,16R)-15,16,25-trihydroxyacta-(23R)-16,23-monoxoside (hydroshengmanol, 5).

Similarly,
sample B also contained at least five Actaea triterpenes,
as indicated by the number of doublet 1H
signals of H-19 observed in the high field region (Figure 3A). Further in silico
searching and matching of HMBC barcodes indicated only two structural
subtypes, i.e., acteol and cimiracemoside derivatives, were present
in the sample (Figure 3C, Table 2). For an individual triterpene, the 1H NMR signals
of one cyclopropane methylene proton (1H) and one methyl group (3H)
should have an integration ratio of 1:3. Therefore, by calculating
this value, four of the five triterpenes were determined to be two
(23R,24R)-23,24-dihydroxyacta-(16S,22R)-16,23;22,25-binoxosides
(cimiracemosides, 6 and 7) as the major
components and two additional minor (24R,25R)-24,25-epoxyacta-(16S,23S)-16,23;23,26-binoxosides (26-deoxyacteols, 8 and 9). However, one triterpene (10), with the chemical shifts of H-19a/b appearing at δH 0.576 and 0.228 ppm, remained unknown due to the absence of the
corresponding 2D HMBC correlations that matched any of the reference
barcodes. This suggested that 10 might have an unusual
(new) structure in the side chain, resulting from the biosynthetic
modification of the methyl groups, CH3-26 and CH3-27, leading to a major change in the HMBC correlation patterns.
This assumption suggested further investigation to characterize the
structure by the following differential analysis of the HSQC spectra.

Figure 3 The triterpene
components in sample B were identified by matching
their HMBC correlations with the reference HMBC barcodes. (A) The 1H NMR signals of cyclopropane methylene protons suggested
the presence of at least five Actaea triterpenes
in sample B. (B) The full HMBC spectrum of sample B. (C) By matching
with the reference HMBC barcodes, only two different skeleton types
of triterpenes were found to be present, in contrast to sample A which
contained five (Figure 2). The integral ratio
between methyl and cyclopropane methylene protons further confirmed
four of the five triterpenes as being two (23R,24R)-23,24-dihydroxyacta-(16S,22R)-16,23;22,25-binoxosides (cimiracemosides, 6 and 7) and two (24R,25R)-24,25-epoxyacta-(16S,23S)-16,23;23,26-binoxosides (26-deoxyacteols, 8 and 9). However, one triterpene (10) could not be matched to a known triterpene skeleton and was subsequently
identified by differential analysis of HSQC spectra (Figure 4).

Differential Analysis of the HSQC Spectra
Owing to
the chemical complexity and limited mass of sample B, further purification
and isolation of 10 was not feasible. As sample B resulted
from repeated fractionation of black cohosh extracts, the signals
of 10 in the spectrum of sample B might be distinguished
from signals common to the spectra of the nearby fractions. By such
a differential analysis of several HSQC spectra, 10 might
be structurally identified from the mixture without a physical separation.
Recently, the differential analysis of 2D-NMR spectra has been shown
to be powerful in the identification of new compounds from (residually)
complex natural product mixtures.23,24 In the present
study, the HSQC spectra were considered to be highly appropriate for
the differential analysis, because they provide both 1H
and 13C chemical shift information but yield much less
complicated cross peak patterns than HMBC due to the restriction to
only one-bond 1H–13C correlations. As
the major structural differences of Actaea triterpenes
arise from modifications of their side chains at C-17, the differential
analysis of their HSQC spectra can be focused on one specific region,
i.e., δH 5.50/3.30 and δC 100.0/50.0,
where the fingerprint signals of the ether, oxirane, and acetoxy groups
in the side chains are commonly observed.

As indicated by the
NP-TLC analysis in Figure 4A, sample B contained
the same components as both nearby fractions Fr-2 and Fr-4. The HSQC
spectra of these three fractions were initially acquired under identical
experimental conditions (S6, Supporting Information). Figure 4B shows the aligned spectra in
stacked mode, with an expansion of the fingerprint region for the
side chains and sugar moieties. After subtracting the cross peaks
in Fr-2 and Fr-4 from Fr-6, a residual HSQC spectrum was obtained,
showing only the cross peaks of 10. The characteristic
signal at δH 4.660 and δC 72.75
(H-16) indicated that the structure of 10 is similar
to (12R)-12-acetoxy-(24S,25R)-24,25-epoxy-(26R&S)-26-hydroxy-3-O-β-d-xylopyranosylacta-(16S,23R)-16,23;23,26-binoxoside (actein, 11), a major acteol-type triterpene in black cohosh. However,
comparative analysis of the 1H NMR spectra of 10 and actein (Table 3) showed that one methyl
signal (CH3-27) was missing in 10.

b The δC values were
determined from the residual HSQC spectra (see main text); JH27a,H27b was 12.6 Hz.

Further investigation of the lower-field 1H NMR spectra
found that the H-24 protons in 10 resonate at δH 4.153/4.253 (26R/26S),
compared to those in actein at δH 3.803/3.948. Similarly,
protons H-26 in actein are observed at δH 6.189/6.144,
compared to those in 10 at δH 5.771/5.748.
Interestingly, in 10, two pairs of geminal protons were
observed at δH 4.949/4.437 and δH 4.606/4.444, respectively, both giving rise to a pair of doublet
signals (J = 12.6 Hz; Figure 5). These data suggested
that compound 10 was a 7:3 mixture of 26β–OH
and 26α–OH isomers, possibly formed by the oxidation
of CH3-27 in actein to −CH2OH. The observed
HMBC correlation between H-27a and C-26 (δC 96.57)
further confirmed that the structure of 10 is a new type
of Actaea triterpene, namely, (12R)-12-acetoxy-(24S,25R)-24,25-epoxy-(26R&S)-26,27-dihydroxy-3-O-β-d-xylopyranosylacta-(16S,23R)-16,23;23,26-binoxoside. As 6 and 7 are known glycosides, it was readily
determined that 10a/b are xylosides based on the residual
sugar signals in the HSQC spectrum. Finally, it is worth noting that
the content of both 10 isomers together was only ∼20
mol %, i.e., ∼80 μg in the ∼400 μg sample.
This demonstrates the power (i.e., the sensitivity and resolution)
of the NMR cryogenic microprobe used in this study for the identification
of compounds in chemically complex and mass-limited samples.

Figure 5 The H-27 signals
and side-chain structures of the 26-hydroxyactein
(10) newly identified in Sample B. This triterpene was
present as an epimeric mixture containing a 7:3 ratio of 26β–OH
(10a) and 26α–OH (10a) as indicated
by two pairs of doublet signals (J 12.6 Hz) of their
geminal protons H-27 at δH 4.949/4.437 and δH 4.606/4.444, respectively.

Conclusions
The present study, using Actaea triterpenes as
the model, demonstrates 2D NMR barcoding as an efficient tool for
dereplication of (residually) complex mixtures of small molecule analogues.
This approach requires the identification of structurally discriminating
signal patterns for the target analytes. The clear advantage of 2D
barcodes over 1D signal patterns is evident as recognizing not only
distinctive clusters but also spatial relationships. Nonetheless,
HiFSA(-based) fingerprints and qHNMR methods10−13 provide confident compound identification
because: (i) HiFSA fingerprints are highly congruent (RMS ≪
1%) matches of complex 1H resonance patterns; (ii) the
iterative nature of the HiFSA process extends well to mixtures; (iii)
multiple (or even all) signals of an analyte are fingerprinted. Recent
results from Silybum(11) and Ginkgo(12,13) indicated that the
intrinsic limitations from the 1D nature of HiFSA remain to be explored.

The triterpenes serve as an excellent example for the 2D barcoding
approach. However, the method is suitable for the analysis of other
molecular classes, especially secondary metabolites, where a large
number of close structural analogues often result in residual complexity
presenting a dereplication challenge. 2D NMR enhances spectral barcoding
with greater signal resolution and more definitive signal patterns,
altogether leading to greater differentiation. Moreover, as shown
by the differential analysis using 2D HSCQ, the improved sensitivity
of cryogenic and/or micro probes make NMR barcoding a powerful tool
for the analysis of minor components that are embedded in complex
mixtures and/or difficult to separate by chromatography. As shown,
2D HMBC and HSQC barcodes can be integrated into discovery armamentarium
to expedite both the dereplication of known and detection/identification
of unknown chemicals. This barcoding is not limited to empirical approaches
but can be integrated with computational approaches to establish structure/spectral
correlations. Keys to developing this approach for new target compounds
are: (i) sufficient reliable NMR data for the target analytes; (ii)
comprehensive literature mining; (iii) establishment and maintenance
of spectral databases; and (iv) validation of the spectral predictions.
Implementation of measurements of shape similarity and related algorithms
will enhance the accuracy and robustness of pattern matching and enable
automation of NMR barcoding. Altogether, these improvements can expand
applicability and augment the performance of NMR barcoding for chemical
identification even within metabolomic mixtures.
