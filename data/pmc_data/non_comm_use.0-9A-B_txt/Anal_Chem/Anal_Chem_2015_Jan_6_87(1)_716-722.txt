Structures for lossless ion manipulations
(SLIM) have recently
demonstrated the ability for near lossless ion focusing, transfer,
and trapping in subatmospheric pressure regions. While lossless ion
manipulations are advantageously applied to the applications of ion
mobility separations and gas phase reactions, ion introduction through
ring electrode ion funnels or more conventional ion optics to SLIM
can involve discontinuities in electric fields or other perturbations
that result in ion losses. In this work, we developed and investigated
a new funnel design that aims to seamlessly couple to SLIM at the
funnel exit. This rectangular ion funnel (RIF) was initially evaluated
by ion simulations, fabricated utilizing printed circuit board technology,
and tested experimentally. The RIF was integrated to a SLIM-time of
flight (TOF) MS system, and the operating parameters, including RF,
DC bias of the RIF electrodes, and electric fields for effectively
interfacing with a SLIM, were characterized. The RIF provided a 2-fold
sensitivity increase without significant discrimination over a wide m/z range and well matched to that of SLIM,
along with greatly improved SLIM operational stability.

Electrospray
ionization mass
spectrometry (ESI-MS) is widely applied for studying chemical and
biological samples ranging from small organic compounds to large biomolecules.1−4 An ESI source nebulizes sample
solutions to create highly charged fine droplets that evaporate to
form ions, often as the droplets travel to the much lower pressure
regions of the mass spectrometer (MS).5,6 A variety of
ion optic approaches to transfer of ions through a conductance limiting
aperture to lower pressure regions from the typically 1–10
Torr interface region have been developed, including skimmers,7 multipole ion guides,8 and ion funnels.9−13 A skimmer, typically installed between the end of
the inlet orifice or capillary and a multipole ion guide to serve
as a gas conductance limiting orifice, is generally designed to sample
only ions located inside of a Mach disk of a supersonic free-jet expansion
and, thus, only samples a limited portion of the ions, biased toward
the heavier ions10,14,15 Both RF multipole ion guide and stack-ring electrodes, with different
phases of RF applied to adjacent electrodes, can be used to confine
ions and increase transmission in these regions.16,17 The electrodynamic ion funnel is an early implementation of such
approaches that can efficiently sample and focus widely dispersed
ions into a small radius for transmission through a conductance limiting
aperture for downstream ion manipulation or mass analysis.18−20 The effective potential from ring electrodes is steep
near the electrodes but weak near the central axis of the rings, which
creates a larger acceptance than the ion emittance area and which
maximizes ion capture efficiency.16 Major
gains in ESI-MS sensitivity, for example, have been achieved by using
ion funnels, as well as in coupling ion mobility separations (IMS)
with MS in order to improve the sensitivity and throughput for many
bioanalytical applications.21−26 For ultrasensitive IMS-MS, a multiple-stage ion funnel
can be used to provide ion transfer and focusing prior to the drift
tube.11,27 The effects of thermal diffusion and Coulomb
repulsion spatially broaden ion clouds while they traverse the drift
region.11 An exit ion funnel can thus be
employed after the drift tube to refocus the ion packets for further
improving IMS-MS sensitivity.21

Recently,
structures for lossless ion manipulations (SLIM) have
been developed and initially demonstrated for a range of ion manipulations,
including ion mobility separations, ion trapping, and switching of
ions between different paths.28,29 The SLIM have been
initially implemented by fabrication of small components that can
then be assembled in a flexible fashion to enable more complex ion
manipulations and in ways previously impractical. The initial SLIM
components were fabricated using printed circuit board (PCB) technology
by directly depositing arrays of “rung” and “guard”
electrodes on two parallel planar surfaces. An appropriate combination
of RF and DC fields was applied to the rung electrodes and DC-only
field to the guard electrodes for ion confinement and control inside
SLIM.30,31 Each of these initial SLIM components consists
of a planar central rung and outer guard electrodes on the PCB surface.
Static DC voltages are applied to both rung and guard electrodes with
additional RF voltage coupled to rung electrodes 180° out of
phase with neighboring rungs, to provide radial confinement.

In one initial study, ions were introduced from a previously developed
ion funnel trap (IFT) to an IMS module fabricated from linear path
SLIM components followed by an exit ion funnel for interfacing with
a time of flight (TOF)-MS.28 While lossless
ion transmission in the SLIM module was achieved, ion losses at the
IFT–SLIM interface were observed. Potential reasons for these
losses include differences in the m/z ranges for effective confinement by IFT and the SLIM, respectively,
as well as the potentials generated at the exit orifice of IFT (a
3 mm i.d. orifice) that do not match well to the SLIM entrance having
a rectangular electrodes arrangement of approximately 5.0 × 4.5
mm.

In this work, we designed and evaluated a new rectangular
ion funnel
(RIF) interface to SLIM, and its integration into a IFT–SLIM-TOF-MS
instrument. The performance and ion transmission were evaluated, and
we show that significant gains in sensitivity were achieved.

Experimental
Design
Materials
Agilent ESI-L low concentration tuning mix
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was used to produce ions with m/z range from 118.09 to 2721.89 in ESI
positive mode for RIF optimization and the sensitivity evaluation.

Ionization Source
The electrospray ionization (ESI)
source used in this study consisted of a chemically etched emitter32 (20 μm i.d.) connected to a 75 μm
i.d. fused-silica capillary (Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ)
through a zero volume stainless steel union (Valco Instrument Co.
Inc., Houston, TX). A syringe pump (Fusion 100, Chemyx Inc., Stafford,
TX) with a 250 μL syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV) was used to infuse
solutions at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. An ionization voltage of 3
kV (relative to the inlet capillary voltage) was applied to the stainless
steel union.

Ion Sampling Interfaces
Positive
ions generated from
ESI were introduced through a heated capillary (140 °C) into
a tandem ion funnel interface consisting of an ion funnel trap (IFT)
followed by a RIF. The ion funnel trap was operated only in the continuous
mode in this study and thus has the properties essentially identical
to a conventional ion funnel. The two ion funnels were operated as
follows: ion funnel trap RF 150 Vpp at 800 kHz; IFT DC
gradient at 15 V/cm; RIF RF frequency at 800 kHz. The inlet capillary
was offset 9.3 mm from the IFT centerline to reduce any gas dynamic
effects in the RIF.

Acquisition
MS data was acquired
using MassHunter software
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) utilizing three replicates
to calculate the mean and the standard error.

Results and Discussion
Ion Simulations
The electrode design of the RIF was
guided by ion simulations prior to fabrication. The simulations of
ion trajectories within the RIF utilized SIMION 8.1 (Scientific Instrument
Services, Inc., Ringoes, NJ) with the SDS (statistical diffusion simulation)
user program to model the effects of collisions of charge particles
(mass range of m/z 50–2050)
with background nitrogen molecules gas at a 4 Torr environment. In
contrast to the conventional ion funnel designs using ring electrodes,
the RIF utilizes 2 pairs of planar electrodes which form a rectangular
outlet to better match the rectangular SLIM entrance dimensions. As
shown in Figure 1a, the RIF entrance was designed
with entrance dimensions of 25.0 × 25.0 mm, 5.0 × 5.0 mm
for the exit, and 50.9 mm for the length of the RIF converging section.
The 34 electrodes used in the simulation were 0.76 mm thick and spaced
0.76 mm apart. For optimum interfacing, the electrical fields applied
to RIF are made similar to SLIM. Similar to the SLIM electrodes, the
rectangular electrodes on each element (lens) include a pair of central
electrodes in the y direction with superimposition
of DC and RF voltages and a pair of guard electrodes in the x direction with DC-only voltages. The field continuity
provided by the optimized voltages (Figure S1, Supporting Information) is expected to provide smooth ion
transmission through the RIF–SLIM interface.

Figure 1 (a) Geometry and dimensions
of RIF and SLIM entrance electrodes
used in simulations. (b–d) Results for ion trajectories through
the RIF showing the effect of: (b) RF amplitudes, (c) DC biases, and
(d) DC gradients. The DC bias was defined as the voltage difference
between the guard electrode and the central rung electrode. See text
for the details of the ion simulations.

The design was first evaluated with simulations by introducing
a wide range of ions (m/z 50–2050,
in 200 m/z steps with 5 ions for
each m/z) at the RIF entrance to
model the effect of RF confinement and without considering effects
due to excessive space charge. The ion motion was monitored for different
RF parameters, particularly at the RIF–SLIM junction. In Figure 1b, selected ion trajectories of m/z 350 and 2050 ions are illustrated (in red and
blue, respectively) with RF frequency at 800 kHz and electric field
at 20 V/cm. The DC bias of the guard electrodes relative to the RIF
central rung electrodes was set to 1 V (ΔVRIF_bias = Vguard – Vrung), while the SLIM guard bias was set to
5 V (as optimized previously).28 The ion
trajectories remain primarily within the confining region of the RIF
and SLIM electrodes with RF amplitudes ranging from 60 to 300 Vpp. The results showed that higher RF amplitudes are necessary
to focus higher m/z ions, e.g.,
the ions of m/z 2050 (the blue trajectories,
Figure 1b). The effective potential (V*) for the averaged motion of ions in the fast oscillatory
field can be described as16  where E0 is the
amplitude of the oscillatory field, q and m are ion charge and mass of the ion, and Ω is the
angular frequency of the oscillatory field. Accordingly, heaver ions
experience less RF confinement which results in weaker ion focusing
for higher m/z ions.

The ion
distribution profile in the xy plane can
be optimized by adjusting DC penetrations in the ion drifting area.
To evaluate the effect of the guard DC bias on the ion transmission,
the simulation was performed under the conditions of RF amplitude
at 300 Vpp and frequency at 800 kHz and electric field
strength at 20 V/cm for RIF. The results in Figure 1c show the ions were dispersed in the y direction
for a positive DC bias at 5 V, dispersed in the x direction for a negative 5 V DC bias, and near equally dispersed
in both directions for 1 V bias. The effect of the DC gradient was
also explored in the simulation in order to optimize the electric
field for the RIF. In the simulations, the operating parameters for
the RIF and SLIM were fixed at RF 300 Vpp and 800 kHz,
while the guard DC biases for the RIF and for SLIM were 1 and 5 V,
respectively. The DC gradient applied on the central rung electrodes
was varied from 5 to 20 V/cm. The results of the simulations (Figure 1d) indicated better transmission of ions for DC
gradients of 10–20 V/cm. Some ion losses were observed at an
electric field below 10 V/cm, presumably due to diffusion and/or space
charge effects.11

RIF Design and Fabrication
Figure 2a,b shows the images of the RIF
entrance and exit lens, respectively,
fabricated utilizing PCB technology. Each lens has two electrode pairs
forming a rectangle shape laid down on a thin dielectric material.
As mentioned above, RF and DC are superimposed on one pair (rung electrodes)
while only DC is applied to the other pair (guard electrodes). The
electrodes are gold-plated copper material with a thickness of 50
μm and 2.0 mm wide. The RIF lenses are 0.76 mm thick and spaced
0.76 mm apart in the z direction to match the current
electrode dimensions used in SLIM. The first 21 lenses have a constant
electrode separation in a dimension of 25.0 × 25.0 mm (in x and y directions), and the last 34 lenses
dimensions decrease linearly from 25.0 × 25.0 mm to 5.0 ×
5.0 mm, forming an overall ∼83 mm-long device.

Figure 2 Design and fabrication
of the PCB-based rectangular ion funnel.
In the photos of (a) the first and (b) the last element of RIF, two
pairs of the rectangular electrodes are connected to other electrodes
on the adjacent elements based on the circuit layouts for the (c)
guard/x- and (d) rung/y-pair to
form (e and f) two independent DC gradients along RIF. Capacitors
in (d) are used in RF coupling and DC blocking for the series of the
central rung electrodes.

The guard electrodes (x-pair) on each element
are connected to a DC power supply while the central rung electrodes
(y-pair) on the same lens are supplied with the superposition
of a DC voltage and a RF waveform. Adjacent rung electrodes on subsequent
lenses in the axial direction have a RF waveform of equal amplitude
but opposite phase to produce RF ion confinement in the y-direction. The DC voltages applied on RIF gradually decreases toward
the exit of the funnel to drive ions along the axial direction (z). Figure 2c,d shows the electronic
circuit layout used to supply the DC and RF while Figure 2e,f shows the measured voltage of the dc potential
on x- and y-pairs. The linearity
of the electrode potentials minimizes field imperfections which may
cause unpredicted ion motion and losses.

RIF Characterization
A schematic of the instrument
arrangement used to characterize the RIF is shown in Figure 3a. The RF for the RIF was maintained at 160 Vpp at 800 kHz, and the guard DC bias was set at 3 V for the
entrance lens and 1 V for the exit lens. A charge collector was placed
at the exit of the RIF to evaluate the ion transmission. During the
experiments, the pressures in the IFT and RIF housing were maintained
at 4 Torr. The plot in Figure 3b shows the
dependence of the transmitted ion current on the DC gradient using
the tuning mix singly charged ions in the m/z 118–2722 range. The increase of the DC gradient
from 0.3 to 9.3 V/cm resulted in 2-fold sensitivity improvement. The
experimental results agree with the trends observed from ion simulations
(Figure 1d). The decrease in ion transmission
for the low DC field is related to the spatial broadening of the ion
packets associated with thermal diffusion and Coulomb expansion effects
on the drift motion.11,27 The ion current reaches a plateau
at ∼9 V/cm, suggesting a minimum requirement of 9 V/cm to avoid
ion losses in the RIF.

Figure 3 RIF characterization. (a) Schematic of the IFT-RIF arrangement.
Ion current was measured as a function of (b) electric field, (c)
DC bias at RIF inlet, and (d) DC bias at RIF outlet. The ion current
was measured by a charge collector after the RIF exit at 4 Torr nitrogen
using an ESI tune mix. The rung DC gradient was set at 9 V/cm for
data shown in panels (c) and (d).

The RIF uses different circuits for x and y electrodes allowing independent control of the DC biases
at the RIF entrance and exit (Figure 2c,d).
To study the effect of DC bias on the ion transmission of the RIF,
the ion current was measured as a function of the guard DC biases
at the entrance lens as well as at the exit lens and is shown in Figure 3c,d, respectively. Comparison of the results (Figure 3c,d) indicates that the measured current was less
sensitive to the guard DC bias at the entrance lens than at the exit
lens. This is attributed to the large acceptance area of RIF compared
to the ion beam diameter (∼3 mm) entering RIF. Results from
the ion current measurements indicate that the optimum range of guard
DC bias was −10 to +10 V for the RIF entrance lens and +1 to
+3 V for the RIF exit lens. The low intensities at the higher and
lower DC biases resulted from ion dispersion in y (Figure 1c upper left) and x (Figure 1c lower right) directions, respectively.

RIF–SLIM Characterization
The RIF and SLIM module
was interfaced with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (model 6224
TOF-MS, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) in order to evaluate
the performance of the ESI-RIF–SLIM-TOF-MS system. Figure 4a shows the schematic of the instrument configuration
used in this work. The charge collector in Figure 3a was replaced by the SLIM module followed by an exit funnel
and then TOF-MS. Details of the SLIM-TOF-MS configuration have been
described previously.28 Figure 4b shows the RIF–SLIM. In this work, the source
IFT was operated at RF 0.8 MHz and 180 Vpp while the exit
funnel was operated at RF 1.2 MHz and 140 Vpp. The RF of
the short quadrupole (Q0) behind the exit ion funnel was 124 Vpp at 0.8 MHz. To ensure optimal ion transmission, the distance
between the RIF exit lens and the entrance of SLIM was kept at 0.76
mm which matches the distance between SLIM rung electrodes. The RF
waveforms applied to RIF and SLIM were not phase locked as the effect
of phase difference on ion motion at a pressure of 4 Torr is negligible.
Figure 5a,b shows the peak intensities as the
function of RF amplitudes for both the RIF and the SLIM module, respectively.
RIF and SLIM were operated at an RF frequency of 800 kHz. The selected
intensities of m/z 622 and 922 ions
plateau at 70 Vpp, and the higher m/z ions at 1822 and 2722 required higher RF amplitudes for
the optimal transmission through the RIF. Similar RF-dependent trends
were observed for SLIM. For instance, the peak intensity of the m/z 2721 ion became constant at RF amplitudes
higher than 200 Vpp (Figure 5b).
The results indicate that optimal transmission of ions for the m/z range from 300 to 2700 was achieved
using Vpp (RIF) > 120 Vpp and Vpp (SLIM) > 200 Vpp.

The mass spectra of the tuning mix by an IFT–RIF–SLIM
(upper) and an IFT–SLIM (lower) interface. The DC biases were
optimized for the maximum ion transmission during the experiments.

A back-to-back comparison of sensitivity
for the IFT–RIF–SLIM
and IFT–SLIM was performed to evaluate the performance of the
new design. The optimal parameters for each arrangement was as previously
determined. RIF was operated at RF of 120 Vpp at 800 kHz, DC gradient
of 9.5 V/cm, and guard bias voltage of 3 V (RIF entrance) and 2 V
(RIF exit). The SLIM device in the IFT–SLIM configuration was
operated as follows: RF 200 Vpp at 800 kHz; DC gradient
at 15 V/cm; DC bias at 5 V. As shown in Figure 5c, a 2-fold of sensitivity improvement was demonstrated using the
tuning mix ion by adding the RIF compared to the conventional IFT–SLIM
interface. Additionally, we did not observe any significant variation
in the spectral intensity during an 11 h stability test (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The enhanced ion transmission
of the IFT–RIF–SLIM is attributed to improved field
continuity at the RIF–SLIM interface.

Conclusions
A rectangular ion funnel (RIF) designed, fabricated, evaluated,
and shown to improve the ion introduction to a newly developed SLIM
device. Ion motion simulations were used to understand and determine
the optimal operating parameters for ion transmission. The RIF was
fabricated using PCB technology and incorporated into a SLIM-TOF MS
system for instrument performance characterization. Three operating
parameters, including RF amplitude, guard electrode DC bias, and central
rung electrode DC gradients, were optimized for the RIF and its interface
with SLIM. The results of the performance evaluation show that the
RIF–SLIM provided a 2-fold sensitivity increase and displayed
an extended robust operation (i.e., high stability), without significant
discrimination over an m/z 300–2700
range.
