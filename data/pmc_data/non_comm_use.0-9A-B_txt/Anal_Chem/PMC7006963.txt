Native ambient mass
spectrometry has the potential for simultaneous analysis of native
protein structure and spatial distribution within thin tissue sections.
Notwithstanding sensitivity, this information can, in principle, be
obtained for any protein present with no requirement for a priori
knowledge of protein identity. To date, native ambient mass spectrometry
has primarily made use of the liquid extraction surface analysis (LESA)
sampling technique. Here, we address a fundamental question: Are the
protein structures observed following native liquid extraction surface
analysis representative of the protein structures within the substrate,
or does the extraction process facilitate refolding (or unfolding)?
Specifically, our aim was to determine whether protein–ligand
complexes observed following LESA are indicative of complexes present
in the substrate, or an artifact of the sampling process. The systems
investigated were myoglobin and its noncovalently bound heme cofactor,
and the Zn-binding protein carbonic anhydrase and its binding with
ethoxzolamide. Charge state distributions, drift time profiles, and
collision cross sections were determined by liquid extraction surface
analysis ion mobility mass spectrometry of native and denatured proteins
and compared with those obtained by direct infusion electrospray.
The results show that it was not possible to refold denatured proteins
with concomitant ligand binding (neither heme, zinc, nor ethoxzolamide)
simply by use of native-like LESA solvents. That is, protein–ligand
complexes were only observed by LESA MS when present in the substrate.

==== Body
Liquid extraction
surface analysis (LESA) mass spectrometry (MS) is an ambient, automated
surface sampling method that was first reported by Kertesz and Van
Berkel.1 LESA makes use of a robotic arm
which dispenses a small droplet of solvent onto a substrate of interest
and extracts its constituents via formation of a liquid junction.
The solvent is reaspirated and the conductive tip introduces the sample
to the mass spectrometer by nanoelectrospray ionization. A wide array
of applications have emerged for LESA, including the analysis of small
molecules,2−6 functionalized nanoparticles,7 lipids,8,9 peptides10−12 and proteins.11,13−18 The majority of these studies used denaturing solvents for extraction
purposes, however, more recently it has been shown that despite the
inherent challenges, proteins can be sampled under near native-like
conditions from solid surfaces15,19or directly from tissue20 with LESA.

The extent to which solution-like
protein structures are maintained in the gas-phase is a key question
underlying native MS.21−24 It is well-documented that protein conformations influence charge
state distributions (CSDs) observed in electrospray MS, with folded
proteins displaying a narrow distribution of lower charge states and
unfolded proteins a broad distribution of higher charge states.25,26 For protein complexes and assemblies, retention of structure is
indicated by stoichiometry (binding of ligands and/or proteins result
in mass shifts). Lastly, integration of ion mobility spectrometry,
such as traveling wave ion mobility spectrometry (TWIMS),27 provides structural information in the form
of drift time profiles or arrival time distributions,28 and estimated rotationally averaged collision cross sections
(CCS).29−31

In earlier work, we demonstrated the benefits
of TWIMS for native LESA MS of proteins embedded in a complex tissue
environment.20 TWIMS not only helps to
separate proteins from other classes of compounds such as lipids,
carbohydrates, and chemical noise, but also enabled us to calculate
the CCS of endogenous protein ions (5+ ions of ubiquitin, 4+ ions
of β-thymosin 4, and β-thymosin 10).

A fundamental
question remains for native LESA MS: Are the structures of the gas-phase
ions observed representative of the structures of the protein in the
solid substrate, or does the LESA extraction process facilitate refolding
(or unfolding)? Initial attempts at addressing this question by use
of a cryo-LESA stage were recently presented by Yan et al.32 Those experiments focused solely on the refolding of ubiquitin and the unfolding of hemoglobin. Ubiquitin is not an ideal model for the study of
refolding; its native structure is particularly stable,33 even in solutions with high organic content.34,35 Critically, the study by Yan et al. did not consider protein refolding
with concomitant noncovalent binding of ligands. A major potential
application of native LESA MS is direct analysis of protein-drug binding
from pharmaceutically dosed tissue samples. It is therefore imperative
to determine whether protein complexes observed in the gas-phase represent
those present in the tissue section or are an artifact of the LESA
extraction process. Here, we have performed a detailed investigation
of two protein standards associated with noncovalent ligand binding:
myoglobin, a holo-protein comprised of apo-myoglobin noncovalently
bound to a prosthetic heme group, and the 29 kDa Zn-binding protein
carbonic anhydrase (Supporting Information (SI) Figure S1). We also considered the binding of carbonic anhydrase
with ethoxzolamide, a sulfonamide derivative. For myoglobin, the presence
of the holo-form indicates retention of folding, and the apo-form
indicates unfolding. For carbonic anhydrase, the presence of the ethoxzolamide
ligand and/or Zn2+ indicates retention of folding and the
apo-form indicates unfolding.

Solutions of the proteins were
either chemically unfolded (by use of organic solvents) or kept in
aqueous ammonium acetate in their native states, before drying onto
solid substrates, that is, the dried samples comprised either unfolded
or folded proteins. The dried proteins were sampled with either native-like
solvents or denaturing solvents and their charge state distributions,
arrival time distributions and CCS determined. In this way, the potential
capacity of LESA extraction for retaining the structure present in
the dried sample, or for refolding or unfolding, could be probed.
The results from LESA MS were compared with direct infusion electrospray
MS of the folded and unfolded protein solutions.

Experimental Section
Materials
Myoglobin from equine skeletal muscle (M0630), carbonic anhydrase
from bovine erythrocytes (C5024), and cytochrome c from equine heart
(C2506), 6-ethoxy-2-benzothiazolesulfonamide (ethoxzolamide) (333328)
and ammonium hydroxide (A6899) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Dorset,
UK). LC/MS grade solvents were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Loughborough,
UK), ammonium acetate was purchased from J. T. Baker (Deventer, The
Netherlands).

Sample Preparation
Protein stocks
were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized powders in LC/MS grade
water and adjusting their final concentration to 10 μM in the
desired solution based on their molar extinction coefficient (13 940
M–1 cm–1, 1280 M–1 cm–1, 50 070 M–1 cm–1 and 18 600 M–1 cm–1, respectively)
using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer at 280 nm. Denatured samples
were prepared at 10 μM with 50% acetonitrile, 49% water, and
1% formic acid, under acidic conditions at pH 2.2. Native-like samples
were prepared using 25 mM ammonium acetate, pH 7.0. A 135 μM
ethoxzolamide stock solution was prepared in 5% methanol and 95% water
(v/v) and added at final concentration of 500 nM to 10 μM bovine
carbonic anhydrase. The protein–ligand solution contained only
residual methanol after mixing and was allowed to incubate for 10
min at room temperature.

1.5 μL of each protein sample
was pipetted onto a glass microscope slide purchased from VWR, (Lutterworth,
UK) and air-dried for various lengths of times (20 min up to 165 min,
as stated in the text). For “liquid LESA”, the protein
samples were directly sampled from a droplet pipetted onto the surface
of the glass slide without further drying.

LESA Traveling Wave Ion
Mobility Mass Spectrometry
An image of the glass slides containing
the protein samples was acquired using an Epson Perfection V300 flatbed
photo scanner. Both the dried or wet droplet locations were selected
with the aid of LESA Points software (Advion). Samples were introduced
for ion mobility mass spectrometry with an Advion TriVersa NanoMate
(Ithaca, NY) using an electroconductive tip coupled to a chip either
by direct infusion from a 96 well microtiter plate or by LESA from
the surface of a glass slide. LESA sampling solvents were 25 mM ammonium
acetate, pH 7.0; 50% acetonitrile, 1% formic acid and 49% water, pH
2.2; or 2.5% ammonium hydroxide and 97.5% water (v/v), pH 11.7, as
stated in the text. The robot was operated with the ChipSoft 8.3.3
software at 1.4 kV capillary voltage and 40 bar pressure, aspirating
3 μL solvent, dispensing 3 μL and reaspirating 3.5 μL
from the surface of the glass.

The Synapt G2 S (Waters Corp.,
Wilmslow, UK) mass spectrometer was operated in positive electrospray
ionization mode, at a helium flow rate of 180 mL/min and nitrogen
flow rate of 90 mL/min. Detailed parameters for each protein are given
in the Supporting Information.

External
mass calibration was performed with CsI clusters in the corresponding
mass ranges. All measurements were performed in triplicate, and at
least 80–100 scans were accumulated with a 2 s scan time. CCS
calibration was performed with myoglobin and cytochrome c following
the protocol described by Ruotolo et al.29 CCS are reported as TWCCSN2→He, that
is, helium reference values have been used to calibrate TWIMS measurements
made in nitrogen.36 Reference CCS values
were obtained from the Bush database30 (myoglobin)
and the Clemmer database24 (cytochrome
c). Mass spectra and drift times were not smoothed, except for the
mass spectra of carbonic anhydrase to which Savitzky Golay function
was applied with a smooth window of three channels and five cycles.
All data were analyzed in MassLynx V.4.1 (Waters, Wilmslow, UK) and
exported for plotting in either Prism GraphPad 6.01 or Origin 2016.
Chimera (UCSF, San Francisco, CA)37 was
used for viewing pdb structures of horse heart myoglobin (1DWR), and
bovine carbonic anhydrase (1 V9E).

Results and Discussion
For the proteins studied, dried protein spots were generated from
either neutral solutions or solutions in which the proteins were chemically
unfolded through use of acidified organic solvents. Hereafter, these
samples are referred to as native protein spots or denatured protein spots.

Myoglobin
Myoglobin is a well-characterized
globular protein which in the condensed-phase comprises eight helices,
β turns and a heme group.38−40 The prosthetic heme group41,42 is noncovalently bound in its hydrophobic pocket in a particular
orientation, forming the 17 567 Da holo-form. Figure 1a shows a representative LESA mass spectrum
obtained from a native myoglobin spot sampled under native conditions,
at 60 s dwell time, neutral pH. Figure 1b shows the direct infusion electrospray mass spectrum
of myoglobin under native conditions. Both display a narrow charge
state distribution from 6+ to 9+ indicating a compact, folded structure.
(The relative intensity of the 6+ ions was very low in LESA mode,
thus it is excluded from further discussion). By contrast, it is widely
accepted that under acidic conditions myoglobin undergoes unfolding.43 The unfolding results in the loss of its prosthetic
group to form apo-myoglobin (16 952 Da) and leads to altered interactions
between the multiple helices.44Figure 1c and d show representative
mass spectra following LESA of a denatured myoglobin spot using denaturing
solvents under acidic conditions, and direct infusion electrospray
of myoglobin under denaturing conditions, respectively. In both cases,
a broad charge state distribution, from 8+ to 25+, of apo-myoglobin
was observed, indicating an elongated conformation accommodating a
large number of charges on its surface.26,45 Moreover,
an abundant peak corresponding to the heme group dominated the mass
spectra, especially in direct infusion electrospray mode. (A heme
dimer was also seen in the direct infusion mass spectrum that is most
likely a product of aggregation46,47).

The results above show that for
both native and denaturing conditions, the LESA mass spectra mirror
the direct infusion mass spectra. To determine whether it is possible
to refold unfolded myoglobin during the LESA extraction, denatured
protein spots were sampled with native LESA solvent at neutral pH
(Figure 1e). The appearance
of a multimodal spectrum26 with a CSD of
7+ to 20+ suggests that a number of folded conformers of apo-myoglobin were present; however, refolding of myoglobin with incorporation
of heme, that is, reconstitution of holo-myoglobin,
was not observed. Feng and Konishi48 showed
that acid denatured myoglobin could be reconstituted with the heme
group when the pH was increased from 2.2 to pH 6.0–8.0 upon
addition of ammonium hydroxide. Similarly, Lee et al.47 showed that myoglobin could be refolded to its holo-form
after short-term acid exposure by the subsequent addition of ammonium
hydroxide to raise the pH to 7.5 or pH 11.47 Both of these studies47,48 showed that refolding
of denatured myoglobin follows a pathway in which apo-myoglobin first
folds into a compact form and second binds the heme. We also sampled
a denatured myoglobin spot with a LESA solvent comprising 2.5% ammonium
hydroxide in water (SI Figure S2). Some
refolding (∼3%) of holo-myoglobin was observed.

The correlation
between CSDs and observed m/z values
(apo vs holo) for LESA and direct infusion electrospray, and the fact
that LESA extraction did not result in reconstitution of denatured
myoglobin suggest that the mass spectra observed following LESA are
a true representation of the folding state of the protein on the glass
slide. To further investigate, we considered the drift time profiles
observed by TWIMS. In particular, we investigated the effect of dwell
time (that is, length of extraction) on observed conformers. (The
protein spot drying time was kept constant at 20 min in each case). Figure 2a shows the drift
time profiles of three charge states of holo-myoglobin (7+, 8+, and
9+) observed following LESA of native protein spots with native solvents
at various dwell times together with those for direct infusion electrospray
of myoglobin under native conditions. The drift time profile for the
8+ charge state acquired in LESA was in agreement with that from direct
infusion performed under native conditions. For the 7+ and 9+ charge
states, however, the LESA drift time profiles revealed peaks to the
left of the main peak, indicating the presence of a collapsed conformer(s).
Counterintuitively, the intensity of these collapsed conformers increased
at longer dwell times. We hypothesized that the collapsed conformers
are a consequence of drying of the protein onto the glass substrate
and that the observed increase in intensity with increasing dwell
time is due to improved extraction efficiency of the dried (and collapsed)
conformers. That is, the longer the dwell time, the more likely that
the collapsed conformers adjacent to the glass substrate will be extracted.

states. (c) Mean TWIMS drift time profiles of native myoglobin (holo-)

time profiles obtained following direct infusion electrospray of myoglobin

charge states.

To investigate the effect of drying
prior to sampling by LESA, we varied the drying times of the native
myoglobin spots from 33 to 165 min and kept the dwell time fixed at
40 s. Figure 2b shows
the drift time profiles obtained for the 7+, 8+, and 9+ charge states.
Collapsed features were observed for both the 7+ and 9+ charge states,
and the relative intensities of these features increased with increased
drying time. For the 9+ charge state, a peak corresponding to a single
dominant collapsed conformer was observed, whereas for the 7+ charge
state, multiple collapsed conformers were observed. The role of water
in mediating the hydrogen-bonding networks and electrostatic interactions
central to protein structure is well-established.49 Our results suggest that these interactions are disrupted
when the protein is dried onto the glass slide giving rise to the
appearance of a minor, more compact population. Next, we deposited
a droplet of myoglobin in native solvent onto the glass substrate
but did not allow it to dry. The droplet was subsequently sampled
by LESA (“liquid LESA”) using various dwell times (Figure 2c). For the 9+ charge
state, no collapsed conformers were observed regardless of dwell time,
and the liquid LESA drift profiles mirrored that obtained following
direct infusion electrospray. For the 7+ charge state, the extent
of collapse was reduced to a single dominant conformer whose relative
intensity did not differ significantly with dwell time; nevertheless,
some collapse was observed in comparison with the direct infusion
electrospray results. The reason for this collapse is not clear. It
may be that a surface interaction between the myoglobin droplet and
the glass slide is responsible.

Returning to the question of
LESA-induced refolding, the results shown in Figure 1e suggest that LESA sampling of denatured
myoglobin spots with native solvents results in some refolding of
the apo-myoglobin but without rebinding of the heme group to form
holo-myoglobin. The aggregation of heme has been reported previously46,47 and that may have prevented refolding of holo-myoglobin here. To
gain insight into the refolding of the apo-myoglobin, we compared
the drift time profiles obtained by TWIMS. Figure 2d shows the drift time profiles of the 7+,
8+, and 9+ charge states of apo-myoglobin following native LESA of
denatured protein spots and the drift time profiles obtained from
direct infusion of denatured myoglobin (note that the 7+ charge state
was not observed in the latter). The remaining charge states (10+
through 18+) are shown in SI Figure S3.
The LESA drift time profiles agreed well with the denatured direct
infusion samples for most charge states (8+, and 13+ to 18+), but
differences were observed for the intermediate charge states (9+ to
12+). Multiple shoulders were observed to the left of the apex of
the main peak indicating collapsed conformers. For comparison, we
looked at the drift time profiles obtained for apo-myoglobin ions
observed following LESA of denatured protein spots with denaturing
solvents, see SI Figure S4. Again, for
most charge states the drift time profiles were in agreement with
those obtained following direct infusion electrospray of denatured
myoglobin; however, multiple collapsed conformers were seen for intermediate
charge states, for example, 9+ charge state. Interestingly, the distribution
of observed conformers in the 9+ charge state differed for the native
LESA and the denaturing LESA of the denatured spot, the former demonstrating
a skew toward more compact structures. It is well-established that
myoglobin acquires a number of conformations at the intermediate and
low charge states under denaturing conditions,25,38,40 the existence of which is further supported
by solution state measurements.50−52 That is, their distribution heterogeneity
has been recognized, and it is plausible that subtle differences occur
among these intermediate forms which are observed in LESA and direct
infusion electrospray.

Carbonic Anhydrase
To investigate
the effects of LESA on a slightly larger protein, we chose carbonic
anhydrase, a β-sheet rich, N-terminally acetylated, zinc-containing
metalloenzyme53 with 259 amino acid residues54,55 and its well-characterized binding with the ligand ethoxzolamide.
Ethoxzolamide, a sulfonamide derivative, has been shown to bind to
both human56,57 and bovine carbonic anhydrases58 by MS and other biophysical tools.56,59−61 Initial experiments were performed in the absence
of ligand. We determined the mass of zinc-bound carbonic anhydrase
(holo-) to be 29 089 Da in close agreement with the observed
mass reported by Gudiksen et al.62 In addition
to sodium and ammonium adducts, we also observed the holo-protein
bound to a bicarbonate ion (+62 Da) as described previously63 (SI Figure S5). At
neutral pH, native LESA of the native protein spot resulted in a narrow
CSD from 9+ to 11+, with the 9+ ions being the most dominant (Figure 3a), while direct
infusion electrospray under native conditions additionally revealed
a low intensity peak corresponding to the 8+ charge state (Figure 3b). Yin and Loo64 observed charge states 9+ to 11+, with the 10+
charge states being the most abundant, at pH 6.8 in the absence of
a supercharging reagent. Under denaturing conditions at pH 2.2, carbonic
anhydrase displayed a CSD of 18+ to 40+ (Figure 3c, d) with the release of Zn2+. A bimodal distribution appears in the denatured mass spectra that
suggest an expanded, flexible structure, potentially with multiple
conformers. Nabuchi et al.65 noted that
at pH 3.8 the mass spectrum of carbonic anhydrase shows a bimodal
distribution, comprised of the apoprotein with a CSD of 11+ to 38+
and the holo (zinc-bound)-protein with a CSD of 10+ to 20+. In a follow-up
study,66 these researchers demonstrated
that a drop in pH from 5.0 to 3.6 resulted in the loss of Zn2+ and in significant unfolding of the N-terminus. We attempted refolding
of denatured bovine carbonic anhydrase by sampling with native LESA
solvent (Figure 3e),
however, peaks corresponding to well-resolved charge states were not
observed presumably due to aggregation of the protein, an occurrence
that has been documented with various alcohols.67Figure 3f shows the drift time profile of the 9+ charge state of the zinc-bound
holo-protein obtained at neutral pH following either direct infusion
or LESA under native conditions. The LESA drift time profiles revealed
the presence of a minor, more compact conformer in addition to the
dominant conformer. This minor conformer is likely due to drying of
the sample rather than LESA itself as described above. The LESA drift
time profiles of the 10+ and 11+ charge states acquired at 60 s dwell
time are in excellent agreement with those observed following direct
infusion electrospray (SI Figure S6).

carbonic anhydrase sampled with LESA at 60 s dwell time, and from

carbonic anhydrase obtained with direct infusion under native conditions,
for the 8+ ions.

We subsequently probed
the binding of carbonic anhydrase with one of its well-characterized
ligands, ethoxzolamide.60,61 Sulfonamide derivatives,
for example, ethoxzolamide, are thought to interact with carbonic
anhydrase via direct association with the Zn2+ in its active
site and key amino acid residues in the hydrophobic pocket.68 Here, 10 μM bovine carbonic anhydrase
and 500 nM ethoxzolamide showed a strong interaction, as revealed
by a 258.3 Da mass shift, with the majority of the protein (86%) being
in a ligand bound form. Under native conditions, for both LESA and
direct infusion electrospray, the charge state distribution was narrow,
spanning charge states from 8+ to 10+ (Figure 3g and h). Under denaturing conditions, a
CSD of 20+ to 40+ was observed following both LESA MS and direct infusion
electrospray MS (Figure 3i and j), both of which revealed the loss of Zn2+ and
the ligand. LESA sampling of native protein/ethoxzolamide spots under
denaturing conditions yielded a similar mass spectrum with a wide
charge state distribution with 19+ to 40+ ions and without Zn2+ or ligand bound (SI Figure S7). This broad CSD demonstrates that the tertiary structure of bovine
carbonic anhydrase had been disrupted, leading to major structural
rearrangements in its active site, hence dissociation of both Zn2+ and the ligand. Significantly, native LESA sampling of denatured
protein/ethoxzolamide spots did not result in detection of the protein–ligand
complex (Figure 3k).
Neither did inclusion of 2.5% ammonium hydroxide in the LESA sampling
solvent result in reconstitution of the protein–ligand complex
(SI Figure S8). Inspection of drift time
profiles for the 9+ and 10+ ions in both the unbound and bound forms
showed excellent agreement between LESA MS and direct infusion electrospray
MS (Figure S9). For the 8+ charge state
we observed good agreement between drift times associated with the
ligand bound ions for both LESA MS and direct infusion electrospray
MS (Figure 3l). A small discrepancy was observed, however, in the relative
intensity of two different unbound conformational populations. For
LESA MS, the dominant conformer has drift time 8.4 ms, whereas for
direct infusion electrospray MS, the conformer with drift time 9.4
ms is dominant (Figure 3l). (Both conformers are observed in each case). We attribute this
deviation to the drying process as discussed above, and point out
that the relative abundance of these ions was particularly low in
the mass spectrum.

CCS Measurements of Myoglobin and Carbonic
Anhydrase
For the proteins studied, CCSs were calculated
from TWIMS measurements for the conformers, including minor conformers,
observed in charge states under native LESA conditions (of native
protein spots) (SI Figure S10). Experimental
CCS values were compared with CCSs calculated from the results of
direct infusion electrospray under native conditions (Table 1). In all cases, there was good
agreement between the CCS calculated following LESA and direct infusion
electrospray.

Literature CCS values for each protein in different
charge states are shown in SI Tables S1 and S2. A range of values have been reported, and these can be explained
by the use of different buffer gases and experimental conditions,38,40,69,70 and by the presence of multiple conformers populated for a given
charge state in the gas-phase.38,40 These observations
highlight the importance of reporting instrumental parameters that
influence the mobility of ions, such as the type of drift gas, temperature,
pressure, and electric field, and the method of sample preparation
(solvent, any additives and pH) to enable comparison of experimentally
derived CCSs between different laboratories.36 In all cases, our results obtained via LESA or direct infusion electrospray
fall within the CCSHe or CCSN2→He ranges
reported in the literature, or are within 4% (myoglobin, 8+). As discussed
above, we attribute the presence of additional, lower abundance, more
compact features in the LESA TWIMS of holo-myoglobin and carbonic
anhydrase to dehydration of the proteins during drying onto the glass
slide, and not the LESA extraction process itself.

Conclusions
Proteins and peptides are essential components of a myriad of cellular
functions. Investigation of changes in their conformation can provide
important insights into the breakdown of biochemical pathways and
disease states. One approach to probe conformation of proteins is
the use native MS. Combining native MS with mass spectrometry imaging
(MSI) has the potential to provide not just structural information
but also information relating to the spatial distribution of proteins
in tissue. To this end, we have already begun exploring native MS
imaging of proteins from thin tissue sections, using TWIMS coupled
to LESA, and reporting respective TWCCSN2→He.20 In this study, we sought to address
a fundamental question: to what extent do the protein structures,
specifically protein–ligand complexes, observed after LESA
extraction correlate with those present in the solid substrate? We
selected two well-characterized, protein standards: a medium sized
α-helix rich protein with a cofactor (holo-myoglobin, 17.5 kDa)
and a larger metal-bound β-sheet rich protein (carbonic anhydrase,
29 kDa) and its well-characterized ligand. Both proteins displayed
well-preserved tertiary structures, maintaining the prosthetic group
or metal ion/ligand in the active center, following native LESA of
native protein spots. It was not possible, however, to refold denatured
myoglobin with incorporation of the heme group simply by use of native-like
LESA solvents. Addition of a strong base to the LESA solvent elicited
some (3%) refolding. Neither was it possible to refold denatured carbonic
anhydrase with incorporation of Zn2+ or its ligand ethoxzolamide.
That is, our results suggest that observation of protein complexes
in native LESA is indicative of their presence in the substrate and
not simply an artifact of the sampling process.

Interestingly,
for some charge states, the drift time profiles obtained following
LESA of the protein spots revealed the presence of more compact conformers
which were not observed following direct infusion electrospray. The
abundance of these conformers increased with both drying time and
dwell time, suggesting that they are the result of dehydration at
the surface of the glass substrate. (The longer the dwell time, the
more efficient the extraction of the lower reaches of the protein
spots). Happily, when considering the question of the relationship
between LESA-sampled structures and those present in the substrate,
this phenomenon is more of a challenge for purified protein standards
in aqueous solution, as is the case here, than for endogenous proteins
in thin tissue sections which are not dried but are in their physiological
environment. An alternative and exciting consideration is that the
effects of dehydration on structure are of great interest to protein
scientists. Our results suggest that native LESA MS may provide a
tool for interrogation of the effects of water removal and further
work in this area is warranted.
