Native
liquid extraction surface analysis (LESA) mass spectrometry
allows direct analysis of folded proteins and protein complexes from
biological substrates, such as dried blood spots and thin tissue sections,
by use of native-like extraction/ionization solvents. Previously,
we have demonstrated native LESA mass spectrometry of folded proteins
up to 16 kDa as well as the 64 kDa hemoglobin tetramer, from mouse
tissues. With denaturing LESA solvents, the highest mass protein detected
in tissue to date is ∼37 kDa. Here, we demonstrate native LESA
mass spectrometry by use of a Q Exactive UHMR Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap
(QE-UHMR) mass spectrometer, pushing the upper mass limit of proteins
detected in tissue to >70 kDa. Moreover, a protein trimer of 42
kDa
was detected and its stoichiometry confirmed by higher energy collision
dissociation (HCD). The benefits of inclusion of detergents in the
LESA sampling solvent are also demonstrated.

==== Body
Native mass
spectrometry is
emerging as a powerful tool for the analysis of protein complexes
and assemblies, providing structural and stoichiometric insights.1 Intra- and intermolecular noncovalent interactions
are maintained by use of nondenaturing electrospray buffers (typically
ammonium acetate) such that tertiary and quaternary structure is retained
in the gas-phase. Retention of the protein fold leads to fewer available
protonation sites, thus native MS is characterized by low charge states
and high mass-to-charge ratios (m/z). Traditionally, native MS has made use of time-of-flight mass analyzers
as they are not limited in the upper m/z range. More recently, higher mass resolving power mass spectrometers,
including Orbitrap2 and Fourier transform
ion cyclotron resonance3 analyzers, have
been applied to native MS. Belov et al. coupled a high m/z quadrupole mass analyzer with an Orbitrap to
achieve isolation and fragmentation of protein assemblies.4 Similar instrumental setups have been applied
to the study of antibody drug conjugates5 and protein–lipid complexes,6 and
a version has recently been commercialized as the Q-Exactive UHMR.

Liquid extraction surface analysis (LESA)7 mass spectrometry is a technique which enables direct analysis of
analytes from solid substrates. We have shown that LESA MS is particularly
suited to the in situ analysis of intact proteins
from substrates including thin tissue sections,8 dried blood spots,9 and bacterial
colonies growing on agar.10 The majority
of work to date has made use of denaturing solvents, and typically
proteins up to mass 20 kDa are detected, although proteins up to 37
kDa have been observed when high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility
(FAIMS) has been employed11. Recently,
we have demonstrated native LESA mass spectrometry, in which folded
proteins and protein assemblies are extracted directly from their
substrate, on a Q-TOF mass spectrometer.12,13 Initial work focused on protein standards dried onto glass substrates.
Native LESA MS of large protein assemblies (up to 800 kDa) and membrane
protein assemblies was demonstrated.14 Moreover,
we have shown native LESA MS imaging of protein and protein complexes
in thin tissue sections of mouse brain and liver on a Q-TOF instrument.15

In this work, we present native LESA MS
of thin tissue sections
of rat brain and rat kidney on an QE-UHMR mass spectrometer, pushing
the upper mass limit of proteins detected from tissue to >70 kDa.
In addition, a 42 kDa protein trimer was detected in the kidney tissue
and its stoichiometry confirmed by high-energy collision dissociation
(HCD). We also show the benefits of inclusion of tetraethylene glycol
monooctyl ether (C8E4) detergent in the LESA sampling/electrospray
solvent.

Methods
Samples
The rat tissue was a kind
gift of Dr. Richard
Goodwin (AstraZeneca). Brain and kidney tissues were obtained from
control (vehicle-dosed) adult male Hans-Wistar rats. HCD of the 28.4
kDa protein was performed on kidney tissue obtained from an adult
male Hans-Wistar rat which had been orally dosed with olanzapine,
terfenadine, nelfinavir, and moxifloxacin. Animals were euthanized
by cardiac puncture under isofluorane anesthetic 2 h post dose. All
tissue dissection was performed by trained AstraZeneca staff (project
license 40/3484, procedure number 10). Tissues were snap frozen in
dry ice chilled isopentane and stored at −80 °C. Tissues
were subsequently cryosectioned at a thickness of 10 μm using
a CM1810 Cryostat (Leica Microsystmes, Wetzlar, Germany) and thaw
mounted onto glass slides.

Surface Sampling
“Contact”
LESA21 was carried out by use of the Triversa
Nanomate
(Advion Biosciences, Ithaca, NY) controlled by the advanced user interface
(AUI) of the Chipsoft software. The extraction/ionization solvent
comprised ammonium acetate (10 mM, 99.999% metal free) (Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) with either 5% methanol (Fisher Chemical, Optima LC/MS
grade, Waltham, MA) or 0.125% C8E4 (0.5 CMC) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)
as indicated in the text. During extraction, 10 μL of solvent
was aspirated from the solvent well before relocating to a defined
position on the tissue. A volume of 5 μL of solvent was dispensed
and held in contact for 60 s before 6 μL of solvent was reaspirated
and introduced to the mass spectrometer by electrospray (gas pressure
of 0.15 psi and voltage of 2.0 kV). For HCD of m/z 4265, the tissue was sampled as above and extracts were
collected in a well and directly infused using a 1.2 mm o.d. borosilicate
capillary (ES387, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Capillary voltages
were set at 1.8 kV in positive mode.

Mass Spectrometry
All mass spectrometry experiments
were performed on a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive UHMR Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap
mass spectrometer. Full scan data were acquired at resolving power
6250 at m/z 400 in the m/z range 400–20 000 (brain) and 2 000–20 000
(kidney). Mass spectra presented are comprised of ∼120–150
scans. For the kidney samples, high-resolution mass spectra were also
recorded at a resolving power 200 000 at m/z 400 in the m/z range 500–6000 or 2 000–20 000. In HCD,
precursor ions were selected for fragmentation in isolation windows
of 20 m/z. MS/MS spectra were recorded
at a resolving power of 200 000 at m/z 400 in the m/z range
500–6 000. For HCD of ions with m/z 4265, the HCD energy was stepped between 150, 180, and
200%. The HCD mass spectrum presented is comprised of ∼180
scans. For HCD of m/z 5687, the
HCD energy was 80% and the mass spectrum presented is comprised of
∼50 scans. The automatic gain control (AGC) mode was fixed.
Ion transfer optics and voltage gradients throughout the instrument
were tuned specifically for every analyte as described previously.22

Data were analyzed by use of Xcalibur
software and BioPharma Finder 3.1 (both Thermo Fisher Scientific)
as described in the text. High-resolution mass spectra were deconvoluted
by use of the Xtract function in Xcalibur to obtain monoisotopic masses.
Mass spectra were processed with a signal-to-noise threshold of 2.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1A shows
the native LESA mass spectrum observed following sampling of a location
within the cerebellum with 10 mM ammonium acetate, 5% MeOH. The mass
spectrum was analyzed by use of the ReSpect deconvolution algorithm
in Biopharma Finder software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Search parameters
and outputs are shown in Supplemental File 1. Twelve proteins were assigned in the mass range 32–80 kDa.
Charge states and molecular weights of the more abundant ions are
indicated. The results obtained following sampling of a second location
within the cerebellum with the same solvents are shown in Supplemental File 2, and a comparison of the
deconvoluted mass spectra is shown in Supplemental Figure 1A. Two of the proteins (MW ∼51 710 and
42 657 Da) were detected at both locations; the remainder differed
between the two locations. None of these species have been reported
via LESA previously and are much larger than the 37 kDa protein species
previously reported in LESA FAIMS experiments with denaturing solvents;11 moreover, this mass range surpasses the 64 kDa
hemoglobin tetramer complex reported in a vasculature feature of liver.15 Proteins of similar molecular weight have been
detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass
spectrometry following pretreatment of the tissue with hexafluoroisopropanol.18 The benefit of the native LESA approach is that
the protein species detected are in their (native) folded conformations,
and noncovalent complexes can be probed (see below).

Figure 1 Native LESA MS of rat
brain tissue. A) Sampling location: cerebellum.
LESA extraction/ionisation solvent: 10 mM ammonium acetate, 5% MeOH.
B) Sampling location: cerebellum. LESA extraction/ionisation solvent:
10 mM ammonium acetate, 0.125% C8E4. C) Sampling location: cerebral
cortex. LESA extraction/ionisation solvent: 10 mM ammonium acetate,

correlate with protein charge states indicated in the mass spectra.

In the majority of cases, sampling
with LESA solvent comprising
10 mM ammonium acetate, 5% MeOH, resulted in unresolved noisy mass
spectra. Sampling of the cerebellum with a solvent comprising 10 mM
ammonium acetate with 0.125% C8E4 resulted in the mass spectrum shown
in Figure 1B. Deconvolution
of the data (see Supplemental File 3 for
search parameters and outputs) revealed five proteins in the mass
range 20–43 kDa. Three further locations were sampled with
10 mM ammonium acetate containing 0.125% C8E4 in the cerebellum, and
in each case, proteins in the mass range 20–43 kDa were detected. Supplemental Figure 1B shows a comparison of
the deconvoluted mass spectra for two separate cerebellum locations
sampled with detergent-containing solvent, and Supplemental Figure 1C shows a comparison of deconvoluted
mass spectra for two cerebellum locations, one sampled with MeOH-containing
solvent and one with detergent-containing solvent. These mass spectra
appear to suggest that sampling with detergent results in a lower
mass range; however, it may simply be the result of sampling different
locations, i.e., different proteins are present in the sample.

The challenges associated with MeOH were particularly noticeable
when sampling tissue from the cerebral cortex region of the brain. Supplemental Figure 2 shows a native LESA mass
spectrum obtained from the cerebral cortex region of the brain tissue.
(Similar mass spectra were obtained from six separate sampling locations
(three locations on two tissue sections analyzed on separate days;
data not shown)). Sampling of this region with the solvent comprising
10 mM ammonium acetate with 0.125% C8E4 resulted in a mass spectrum
containing multiple protein peaks, see Figure 1C. Previous work by Fournier and co-workers
showed that inclusion of ionic detergents (SDS and CHAPS) in the LESA
sampling solvent improve protein extraction as demonstrated by SDS
PAGE of the LESA extract.19 Our results
suggest that use of nonionic detergents may also improve protein extraction.
Deconvolution of the data (see Supplemental File 4 for search parameters and outputs), together with manual
analysis, revealed the presence of 10 proteins in the mass range 20–43
kDa. In addition, the peak at m/z 2142 corresponds to the 4+ charge state of ubiquitin which has been
described previously.15 The 42.6 kDa protein
and the 20.7 kDa protein were also detected in the cerebellum region. Supplemental Figure 1D shows a comparison of
two deconvoluted mass spectra from each region (cerebellum and cerebral
cortex).

Figure 2A shows
a native LESA mass spectrum (sampling solvent, 10 mM ammonium acetate,
0.125% C8E4) obtained from the outer cortex region of rat kidney.
Deconvolution of this mass spectrum suggests the presence of a 42.6
kDa protein with peaks at m/z 3878
(11+), 4265 (10+), 4739 (9+), and 5331 (8+) (see Supplemental File 5). In addition, an abundant peak, which
was not assigned by the deconvolution algorithm, was observed at m/z 5687. High-resolution scans of the
ions at m/z 4265 and m/z 5687 (see inset) confirmed the charge states
as 10+ and 5+ and the monoisotopic masses as 42 616 Da and
28 411 Da, respectively. Supplemental Figure 3 shows a native LESA mass spectrum, again obtained from the
outer cortex of the kidney, sampled with 10 mM ammonium acetate, 5%
MeOH. This mass spectrum also contains a dominant peak at m/z 5687, in addition to peaks at m/z 4739, m/z 4062, and m/z 3555. Deconvolution
reveals these peaks as corresponding to the 5+, 6+, 7+, and 8+ charge
states of a protein of mass 28.4 kDa (see Supplemental File 6). Figure 2B shows the HCD mass spectrum obtained from the 10+ ions of the 42.6
kDa protein. The results suggest that protein is a homotrimer: the
dominant products are 5+ monomer ions observed at m/z 2844 (MW 14.2 kDa). The complementary 5+ dimer
ions are observed at m/z 5687 (MW
28.4 kDa). Monomer ions were also observed in the 6+ charge state.
Two further abundant fragments were detected, one at m/z 2047 (2+) and one at m/z 3375 (3+). Presumably these fragments derive from backbone
cleavage within the monomer; however, it was not possible to identify
the monomer based on these fragments. Supplemental Figure 4 shows an HCD mass spectrum obtained from 5+ ions of
the 28.4 kDa protein. These results suggest that the 28.4 kDa protein
is a homodimer, the dominant product being the monomer in the 3+ charge
state. Overall, our findings suggest that both homotrimer and homodimer
are observed in the native LESA mass spectra obtained with detergent-containing
solvent, whereas the homodimer is dominant when methanol-containing
solvent is used, demonstrating that detergent improves protein extraction.

Sampling location, medulla; LESA extraction/ionization solvent, 10

are listed. Colors correlate with protein charge states indicated
in the mass spectra.

Figure 2C
shows
a native LESA mass spectrum obtained following sampling of the (inner)
medulla region of the kidney. Deconvolution of this mass spectrum
(see Supplemental File 7), combined with
manual validation, reveals 15 proteins with molecular weights up to
47 kDa. In addition, the peak at m/z 3313 corresponds to the 3+ charge state of a protein of mass 9 940
Da, which has been reported previously in denaturing (acetonitrile
based) solvent systems.20 The results obtained
following sampling of a second location within the medulla region
are shown in Supplemental File 8, and a
comparison of the deconvoluted mass spectra is shown in Supplemental Figure 1E. The similarity between
the two locations within the medulla region of the kidney is greater
than for two locations from the same region of the brain. The proteins
detected differ between the medulla and cortex regions of the kidney
as illustrated by the comparison of deconvoluted mass spectra shown
in Supplemental Figure 1F.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we demonstrate that large intact proteins, >70
kDa,
can be analyzed directly from tissue by use of native LESA mass spectrometry
on the QE UHMR mass spectrometer. The benefit of including nonionic
detergent in the LESA extraction solvent is also demonstrated. For
example, while it was possible to obtain native LESA mass spectra
from the cerebellum region of the brain in the absence of detergent,
the same was not true for the cerebral cortex. These benefits may
arise due to improved protein extraction or improved electrospray
stability, but further experiments are required to confirm the origin
of these improvements. Furthermore, we present the detection of a
noncovalent protein complex, a trimer of mass 42.6 kDa, directly from
kidney tissue for the first time.
