We
propose an approach for the prediction of the depth of a single
buried object within a turbid medium combining spatially offset Raman
spectroscopy (SORS) and transmission Raman spectroscopy (TRS) and
relying on differential attenuation of individual Raman bands brought
about by the spectral variation of matrix absorption (and scattering).
The relative degree of the Raman band changes is directly related
to the path length of Raman photons traveling through the medium,
thereby encoding the information on the depth of the object within
the matrix. Through a calibration procedure with root mean square
error of calibration (RMSEC) = 3.4%, it was possible to predict the
depth of a paracetamol (acetaminophen) inclusion within a turbid matrix
consisting of polyethylene (PE) by monitoring the relative intensity
of two Raman bands of paracetamol exhibiting differential absorption
by the matrix. The approach was shown to be largely insensitive to
variations of the amount of the inclusion (paracetamol) and to the
overall thickness of the turbid matrix (PE) with a root mean square
error of prediction (RMSEP) maintained below 10% for the tested cases.
This represents a major advantage over previously demonstrated comparable
depth determination Raman approaches (with the exception of full Raman
tomography requiring complex mathematical reconstruction algorithms).
The obtained experimental data validate the proposed approach as an
effective tool for the noninvasive determination of the depth of buried
objects in turbid media with potential applications including determining
noninvasively the depth of a lesion in cancer diagnosis in vivo.

==== Body
Raman spectroscopy
is a powerful
tool for subsurface analysis of turbid media applied to a wide range
of analytical fields such as pharmaceutical analysis in quality control,
security screening, and disease diagnosis.1,2 To
provide noninvasive analysis, the two cornerstone techniques are spatially
offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS)3 and transmission
Raman spectroscopy (TRS).4,5 Both methods take advantage
of characteristic light propagation in diffusely scattering (turbid)
media for retrieving information about the chemical makeup of deep
layers and other concealed objects.6 In
the SORS configuration, the depth accessibility and sensitivity are
obtained by introducing a spatial separation between the excitation
and Raman collection zones (i.e., the spatial offset). Raman spectra
acquired at larger offsets contain increased contributions from increasing
sample depths.7 In contrast, TRS, which
involves a 180° collection-illumination geometry, yields information
on the chemical composition of the entire probed volume,8 and in its basic implementation, it does not
provide any depth information. In many application areas, it is beneficial,
apart from retrieving chemical information on a buried layer or object,
to also identify its depth within the matrix. Such noninvasive localization
of a specific target is potentially significant in a number of areas.
For example, in a clinical environment, the localization of a cancer
lesion within the body in vivo could potentially facilitate more accurate
diagnosis or improve the effectiveness of subsequent treatments. Within
this context, both SORS and TRS can be extended to provide such noninvasive
evaluation of depth of a buried object in tissues. Previous concepts
predominantly rely on calibrations that are specific to the studied
system using individual SORS9,10 or TRS11,12 measurements. In these cases, the model is inherently dependent
on the amount of the buried material (with the exception of a study12 where an external optical element is used with
TRS geometry and which is not directly applicable to SORS). This restricts
the applicability of the technique. Here we aim at developing a method
that is largely insensitive to the amount of the buried material in
the matrix permitting applications such as localization of a cancer
lesion within the body without knowing its exact extent, whether through
native signals or labeled SERS nanoparticles. As such, our model should
ideally be largely insensitive to the changes in the amount of the
buried material and if possible also to the overall thickness of the
matrix. To date, a specific deep Raman concept has been proposed and
demonstrated that exhibits gross insensitivity to the amount of the
object localized: 3D Raman optical tomography13,14 building on earlier advances in a parallel field of time-domain
near-infrared diffuse optical tomography (DOT).15,16 This method was demonstrated to be effective in noninvasively reconstructing
images of heterogeneities within a turbid medium and providing the
spatial information with rich chemical information on a target object.
Although widely applicable, these methods require 3D-tomographic image
reconstruction algorithms which are complex and nondeterministic.17,18 Instead, here we focus on a conceptually much simpler problem of
determining the depth of a single, chemically distinct object (e.g.,
spherical inclusion) buried within a turbid matrix which can be tackled
with a much simpler approach requiring little computational efforts
and yielding a more deterministic outcome and as such of potentially
higher practical utility in relevant situations. The approach consists
of using a combination of SORS and TRS measurements and subsequent
global utilization of the combined data sets to retrieve depth information.
The depth of the inclusion is extrapolated through monitoring the
differential Raman intensity of two or more discrete Raman bands that
undergo different matrix absorption (and scattering) and as such encode
the depth of the buried object. It is well established that the optical
properties of a specific medium vary with the wavelength of light.6 For that reason, Raman photons of different wavelengths
are influenced by the medium’s optical parameters (absorption
coefficient, μa; reduced scattering coefficient,
μs′) to potentially different degrees.19 This results in a different attenuation for
Raman photons at different wavelengths when traveling through the
medium.20 In particular, Raman bands which
undergo higher absorption result in having a lower intensity (when
collected at the surface) with respect to the Raman bands undergoing
lower absorption. Due to this effect, the mean depth attained statistically
by Raman photons in a turbid matrix can be monitored through differences
in the relative intensities of the Raman peaks of the inclusion material.11 The prediction of the depth is based on the
evaluation of relative intensity (i.e., intensity ratio) and results
as the weighted average of both SORS and TRS predictions. As such,
the proposed approach is inherently largely insensitive to sample
parameters such as the amount of the buried object and as such more
widely applicable. A simpler implementation of this method was recently
demonstrated for TRS alone.11 Here we extend
the method to include a combination of SORS and TRS yielding more
accurate depth determination and having a wider applicability than
possible with TRS approaches alone.11,12 The extension
to SORS alone is also demonstrated here for the first time. The concept
is applicable to certain depths even in situations where the overall
sample matrix is too thick for TRS to yield detectable Raman spectra
from the buried object, leaving SORS data alone to yield the depth
information. In our study, we compare the performance of the combined
SORS and TRS concept with that of TRS alone and SORS alone, demonstrating
the higher utility and accuracy of the combined approach over the
individual ones. We have also tested the gross insensitivity of the
model to the amount of material in the buried object and to the overall
thickness of the turbid medium.

Experimental Section
Deep Raman
Setup
Raman measurements were carried out
using a custom-built Raman system designed to perform measurements
in both transmission mode (TRS) and conventional point-like spatial
offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS). The excitation wavelength consists
of an NIR diode laser emitting at 830 nm (IPS, Monmouth Junction,
NJ). The laser light is delivered to the sample surface through an
optical fiber (200 μm core MHP200L02, Thorlabs) and a 1 in.
diameter optical imaging system in order to achieve a spot size of
∼500 μm at the sample surface. The spatial offset is
achieved by moving the entire excitation path assembly along the plane
parallel to the sample surface (see Figure 1a) with a motorized stage (MTS25-Z8 whit
KDC101, Thorlabs). A prism (PS910, Thorlabs) and three dielectric
mirrors (BB1-E03, Thorlabs) redirect automatically the excitation
light to the backside of the sample for transmission measurement at
the extreme spatial offset settings using the motorized stage. Raman
scattered light is collected at an angle of ∼30° to the
normal incidence from a zone of approximately 1.5 mm diameter on the
sample surface and relayed via an optical fiber bundle system to a
Kaiser spectrometer (HoloSpec f/1.8i) coupled to a deep-depletion
CCD camera (Andor iDus-420A-BR-DD). The fiber bundle (custom-made,
22 active fibers with a core diameter of 220 μm each,21 CeramOptec Industries, Inc.) has a round to
linear transformation configuration to match the spectrograph slit.
Raman spectra were acquired in the spectral range 112–1938
cm–1 with a spectral resolution of ∼8 cm–1 for 20 s × 5 accumulations and a laser output
power of 200 mW.

Phantom Sample and Characterization
Three different
homogeneous model samples, made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE),
polyethylene (PE), and polystyrene (PS), exhibiting different optical
properties (μa, μS′) in the
NIR spectral region (see Figure 2a–c), were used as turbid media. A heterogeneous
phantom structured as a layered turbid matrix made of PE (50 mm ×
50 mm × 3 mm each layer) and paracetamol (cylindrical shape radius
= 2, 3, and 5 mm, thickness = 3 mm) was used for mimicking the presence
of an inclusion (paracetamol) at depth in the turbid matrix (PE) (see Figure 1a, bottom). The bilayer
phantom was an assembly in order to permit the variation of the overall
thickness (t = 12, 18, 21, and 24 mm) and the amount
of the inclusion (m = 125, 250, and 500 mg of paracetamol).
The optical properties of the phantom matrix were characterized using
a benchtop spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere (ISR-2600Plus,
Shimadzu). Diffuse reflectance measurements were performed from 700
to 1100 nm with a spectral resolution of 0.2 nm. From the spectral
reflectance of the sample (R(λ)), the Kubelka–Munk
model22 was applied for evaluating the
scattering and absorption properties of the turbid matrix (i.e., k/s
Kubelka–Munk function23).

the position of the Raman peak used to reconstruct the attenuation
profile (k/s) from differential Raman spectra (red dotted line). The
black dotted line shows the absorbance (k/s) measured with the spectrophotometer.

Protocol and Data Analysis
The measurement protocol
consisted of the sequential acquisition of Raman spectra from the
bilayer phantom at different spatial offsets (i.e., from 0 to 12 mm
with a step of 1 mm) and in transmission Raman configuration. The
first step of the protocol consisted of the alignment of the inclusion
on the optical axis (z-axis) of the Raman system.
This was carried out by maximizing the TRS signal (or a SORS signal)
of the inclusion by moving the sample sideways, along the (x, y) axes. This preliminary step ensured
the location of the inclusion on the optical axis of the Raman system.
The experiments were then initiated by locating the inclusion (paracetamol)
at the sample surface (z = 0) and subsequently moving
it along the z-axis in steps of 3 mm. A calibration
model for depth prediction was created using the following steps:
(i) For each depth (z) and each spatial offset (SO
= 0–12 mm and TRS), a Gaussian-shape curve fit was performed
on the two Raman bands of paracetamol (857 and 1235 cm–1), in order to evaluate the effect of differential absorption on
their intensity (see Figure 1b). (ii) The natural logarithm of the intensity ratio of the
two bands (857-to-1235 cm–1) against the depth (z) was fit with a linear trend11 (R2 > 0.945, Supporting Information S-4) for each spatial offset and transmission measurement.
(iii) The predicted depth was extrapolated from a weighted average
of all of the depth models resulting from the modeling of each spatial
offset and transmission measurement.

Results and Discussion
First, we studied the SORS and TRS properties of several matrixes
without any inclusions in them. When Raman photons travel through
a turbid medium, which exhibit wavelength-dependent changes in absorption
and scattering, relative differences in intensity between different
Raman bands can be observed (Figure 2a–c). As shown in Figure 2, for a zero spatial offset (SO = 0 mm),
there is a minimal travel distance for the detected Raman photons
and as such a minimal intensity distortion (decrease) to Raman bands
due to absorption present. By increasing the spatial offset, the migration
distance of the detected Raman photons from the matrix increases and
consequently larger intensity distortions are observed where differential
matrix absorption is present. Figure 2b highlights a decrease in the relative intensity of
polystyrene Raman peaks at 628 and 1200 cm–1 relative
to the Raman components at 1001 and 1032 cm–1. Similarly,
the polyethylene Raman band at 1292 cm–1 significantly
decreases in intensity compared to the 1063 cm–1 band (Figure 2c).
Conversely, no relative intensity changes were observed for the Teflon
phantom (PTFE, Figure 2a) due to the fact that the PTFE sample does not exhibit any significant
differential absorption in the investigated spectral range.

The changes in the relative Raman intensity due to the differential
absorption are visualized in Figure 2d,e showing the difference Raman spectra (i.e., ΔRaman)
between a large offset (TRS or 10 mm) and the zero-offset spectra
(0 mm offset). From these, an approximate profile of the absorption
of the turbid material can be reconstructed (Figure 2d,e, red dotted line). Specifically, it is
obtained by fitting to a Gaussian model the difference Raman spectra
(y-coordinate) at the Raman peaks location (x-coordinate, Figure 2d,e, black-filled circles). In the proposed depth determination
approach, the reconstructed absorption profile of the turbid material
can be used to guide the selection of Raman peaks of the inclusion
which undergo different intensity attenuation and therefore they encode
depth information. It is, however, not used in any other way in the
process of determining the depth of inclusions.

The next set
of measurements included a matrix (PE) with an inclusion
(paracetamol) buried at different depths within them. The reconstructed
profile of the optical properties of the PE model sample (Figure 2e), here used as
a turbid matrix, revealed that the two Raman peaks of paracetamol
at 857 and 1235 cm–1 should exhibit a differential
absorption behavior. Since the band at 1235 cm–1 falls under the absorption band of the turbid matrix (PE absorbance
peak at 930 nm/1324 cm–1 expressed as a relative
shift from the 830 nm excitation wavelength), its intensity is dramatically
reduced relative to the 857 cm–1 component with
increasing mean photon travel distance as a result of increasing depth
(depth z, S-2). This difference in relative intensities
can be satisfactorily approximated with a linear function when plotted
as a natural logarithm of the ratio of the intensities (857 to 1235
cm–1) versus depth (i.e., z, Figure 3a). Figure 3b shows the predicted depths
of the inclusion resulting from the measured intensity ratio from
all different spatial offsets and TRS measurement. For each specific
depth, the variability of the intensity ratio (the dot spread along x-axes in Figure 3b) highlights the different behavior of each model, while
the variability of the predicted depth (the dot spread along y-axes in Figure 3b) captures the error of the models. Through the procedure
previously described, by combining the output of all different spatial
offsets and transmission measurements (Figure 3b), it was possible to predict the depth
of paracetamol inclusion with a root-mean-square error of calibration
(RMSEC) of 3.4% (i.e., ±0.61 mm). In Figure 3c, the effectiveness of SORS alone and TRS
alone for depth prediction is compared: SORS (model 2 in Figure 3d) predicts depth
with an RMSEC of ∼5%, but it loses sensitivity for deeper positions
of the inclusion in the turbid media (d > 9 mm).
On the other hand, TRS (model 3 in Figure 3d) has good sensitivity even in cases of
larger depths, but it yields a lower accuracy for smaller depths (d < 9 mm).

Predictions of a paracetamol inclusion depth resulting from all SORS
and TRS measurements; the horizontal line indicates the actual depth;
orange stars indicate the weighted average resulting from the proposed
combined approach. (c) Predicted vs measured depth obtained with the
three models based on averages weighted for the accuracies of the
performance of individual models built for each individual spatial
offset and transmission data sets. Model 1 is based on all SORS (SO:
0 to 12 mm) and TRS measurements. Model 2 is based on the measurement
of all spatial offsets for SORS alone (SO: 0 to 12 mm). Model 3 is
based on TRS measurements alone.

The proposed combined approach, that takes into account both
TRS
and SORS measurements (model 1 in Figure 3d), benefits from the advantages of both
geometries and accurately predicts depth with a lower error overall
(lower RMSEC ≅ 3.4%). In a real case scenario, the amount of
the inclusion is often unknown and also the thickness of turbid media
can vary. An ideal model, from our perspective, should be able to
predict depth regardless of the thickness of the turbid media and
with no a priori information on the amount of inclusion. Figure 4a–c shows
the prediction of paracetamol depth, resulting from the three different
models presented above, in seven different experiments in which the
thickness and amount of material was changed (thicknesses and amounts
summarized in Table 1). These additional sets of experiments confirmed the previous accuracy
outcomes for SORS and TRS and established the relative robustness
of the models to the amount of inclusion and thickness of the matrix.
The model based on only SORS measurements (model 2) predicted small
paracetamol depths (d < 9, 12 mm) well, but the
loss of signal sensitivity became even more evident for larger thicknesses
and smaller amounts of inclusion. This behavior translates into the
root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP) that varies between 10
and 25% (Figure 4d).
The TRS concept proved to be largely insensitive to the amount of
inclusion (blue, yellow, and green dots in Figure 4), while a slight distortion from the expected
value was observed by changing the thickness of the matrix (red and
brown dot in Figure 4). In particular, TRS slightly underestimated the depth for data
sets with smaller thicknesses (t = 12 mm, m = 500 mg). Overall, it can be concluded that the prediction
of paracetamol depth on the basis of both SORS and TRS information
resulted in gross insensitivity to the thickness of turbid media and
the amount of inclusion (Figure 4a), with an RMSEP of inclusion depth always below 10.5%
for all seven experiments. These results validate the use of the proposed
approach even with no true prior information regarding the turbid
media thickness and the inclusion amount. However, it should be noted
that changing the chemical nature of the matrix and/or inclusion would
necessitate building a new model.

Conclusion
We have shown how the proposed approach, based
on SORS and TRS
measurement, can successfully predict the depth of a single target
object in a diffusely scattering medium. Here, we have taken advantage
of the different depth sensitivity of SORS and TRS to improve the
accuracy of the external calibrations for depth prediction. The results
were discussed in the context of a previous study using only TRS measurements.11 The proposed combined approach is more accurate
(lower RMSEC and RMSEP) and more robust to the variability of the
inclusion amount and matrix thickness with respect to using TRS alone.
Despite SORS losing effectiveness at greater depths with respect to
TRS, it can be used in situations where TRS cannot be applied (for
example, due to prohibitively high matrix thicknesses). This leads
to a wider range of noninvasive applications where depth determination
of a single inclusion is desired. In clinical settings, the ability
to identify and localize the presence of anomalies noninvasively and
at depth is especially important. Examples of potential applications
include the localization and depth prediction of a cancer lesion in
tissue or SERS nanoparticle cluster in biological tissues. In terms
of applying the concept to biomedical studies, it is worth noting
that its heterogeneity could present a considerable challenge. Different
models may have to be built for different anatomical parts, and potentially,
the concept may indeed need to be augmented by additional auxiliary
techniques such as ultrasound imaging (e.g., to determine a thickness
of a lipid layer) or theoretical models of light propagation in heterogeneous
layered material (e.g., Monte Carlo simulations). The addition of
this information in the construction of a calibration model might
considerably improve the precision of the proposed approach in such
challenging situations.
