Post-translational modifications
that do not result in a change
in mass are particularly difficult to detect by mass spectrometry.
For example, isomerization of aspartic acid or epimerization of any
chiral residue within a peptide do not lead to mass shifts but can
be identified by examination of independently acquired tandem mass
spectra or by combination with another technique. For analysis of
a biological sample, this means that liquid chromatography or some
other type of separation must be used to first separate the isomers
from one another. Furthermore, each specific m/z of interest must be sampled repeatedly to allow for comparison
of the tandem mass spectra from each separated isomer, which contrasts
with the traditional approach in proteomics where the goal is typically
to avoid resampling the same m/z. We illustrate that isomerization and epimerization of peptides
can be identified in this fashion by examination of long-lived crystallin
proteins extracted from a sheep eye lens. Tandem mass spectrometry
relying on a combination of radical directed dissociation (RDD) and
collision induced dissociation (CID) following separation by liquid
chromatography was used to identify modified peptides. Numerous sites
of isomerization and epimerization, including several that have not
been previously identified, were determined with peptide specificity.
It is demonstrated that the specific sites of amino acid isomerization
within each peptide can be identified by comparison with synthetic
peptides. For α-crystallin proteins, the sites that undergo
the greatest degree of isomerization correspond to disordered regions,
which may have important implications on chaperone functionality within
the context of aging.

==== Body
The eye lens
is a very peculiar
and interesting construct.1,2 It is composed of 90%
crystallin proteins.3 Among the crystallins,
alpha crystallins are most abundant and serve as structural elements
and as chaperones.4,5 To achieve the desired index of
refraction required for an optic, the concentration of proteins within
the lens must be high.6 At the same time,
aggregation of proteins into particles capable of scattering light
must also be avoided. The alpha crystallins assemble into large oligomeric
species of between 20 and 40 monomers which are highly dynamic in
nature. Numerous studies have indicated a preference for even numbered
oligomers, suggesting that the assemblies are comprised of dimer building
blocks.7 Additionally, within each monomer
several structural regions have been identified that each serve distinct
roles. The central alpha crystallin domain folds into a well-defined
structure that is conserved across many of the small heat shock proteins.
In contrast, the N-terminal region and the C-terminal extension do
not form well-defined structures at the monomer level; however, these
regions help regulate higher order oligomer assembly and are necessary
for chaperone activity.

As fiber cells in the eye lens mature,
all organelles are ejected.
The mature fiber cells perform very few metabolic functions, have
low oxygen and energy demands, and are avascular. Perhaps most interestingly,
the crystallin proteins that were present in the lens of a person
when born are still present when they die. In other words, there is
no turnover of proteins within lens fiber cells. Given these properties,
it is not surprising that many studies have focused on examination
of the changes that occur to lens proteins upon aging. It has been
established that numerous post-translational modifications occur to
crystallin proteins as a function of aging. Deamidation, truncation,
glycation, phosphorylation, disulfide bond formation, oxidation, acetylation,
and methylation are among the most commonly studied modifications.8−12 However, there is also evidence that epimerization, which occurs
when a single amino acid undergoes stereoinversion, is also an important
modification that occurs as a function of aging.13−15 Epimerization
leads to no change in mass and it is significantly more difficult
to detect than the other post-translational modifications (PTMs) listed
above, which may explain why epimerization has received significantly
less attention.16

Aspartic acid is
a special amino acid in the context of PTMs that
are not accompanied by changes in mass. Backbone attack of the side
chain yields a succinimide ring that can lead to the formation of
several isomeric forms. Simple ring opening will yield a mixture of
aspartic acid and isoaspartic acid, where the side chain has essentially
inserted into the peptide backbone.17 In
addition, the chiral alpha hydrogen atom in the succinimide ring can
undergo stereoinversion, which can lead to the formation of d-aspartic acid and d-isoaspartic acid. Since these two pathways
can occur in conjunction, the end result is that aspartic acid is
frequently converted into four isomeric states, none of which are
distinguished by a shift in mass. For asparagine, these states can
also be populated, though only when accompanied by deamidation. Both
isomerization and epimerization significantly perturb the local structure
of the molecule at the affected residue. For example, it has been
demonstrated that substitution of d-residues can significantly
reduce the propensity of peptides to adopt alpha helical structures.18 Similar structural changes may also explain
why elevated epimerization is also associated unfavorably with numerous
diseases. For example, racemization of serine residues in β-amyloid
increases the rate of aggregation and accelerates degeneration of
neuronal cells, which may be connected to the cause of Alzheimer’s
disease.19 Epimerized residues are also
more frequently detected in crystallin proteins from cataract sufferers
than in age controlled healthy individuals.20,21 It is clear from these initial findings that characterization of
isomeric PTMs, though difficult, is warranted.

The majority
of work in this area involving mass spectrometry has
focused on examination of isolated molecules. For example, it has
been demonstrated that differences in MS2 spectra can be
used to distinguish aspartic acid from isoaspartic acid.22,23 Similarly, differences in MS2 spectra can be used to
distinguish peptide epimers.24−27 Quantitative analysis is typically carried out by
calculation of an R value28 that corresponds to the degree of difference between the two fragments
that change the most in the MS2 spectra obtained from each
isomer (additional details about R values are provided
below). R values of 1 correspond to identical spectra,
whereas larger values reflect differences between the spectra being
compared. Importantly, this method requires that both the all l peptide and the epimer with a single d residue be
independently evaluated. Furthermore, not all fragmentation methods
are equivalent in epimer disambiguation. For example, although collision
induced dissociation (CID) can yield acceptable results, it generally
offers less structural sensitivity than electron or radical based
dissociation methods. Recent work has demonstrated that radical directed
dissociation (RDD) yields the highest R values for
epimer detection and has the advantage of the greatest flexibility
in terms of charge state selection.29 For
identification of isoaspartic acid, electron capture dissociation
(ECD) is advantageous because it yields a characteristic fragment
that can facilitate identification.30,31

Implementation
of mass spectrometry in conjunction with liquid
chromatography for the analysis of more complicated isomer containing
samples requires additional considerations. Fortunately, analysis
of biological samples within the context of aging simplifies the experiment
in one important way: some of the original isomer will always be present.
All processes by which spontaneous epimerization/isomerization occur
are incomplete, therefore some of the original peptide or protein
will always remain. Given this information, the challenge can be broken
down into two components: separation and characterization. Separation
is typically carried out with standard liquid chromatography (LC),
which is capable of baseline separating many isomers (including epimers)
using typical C18 columns (i.e., columns packed with chiral media
are not required).16,32 Therefore, separation can be
carried out in a similar fashion to other proteomics experiments.
However, characterization requires that the same m/z be examined multiple times, which is typically
avoided in most proteomics experiments. For evaluation of isomeric
species, multiple tandem MS spectra at the same m/z must be acquired to confirm epimerization and
for calculation of relevant R values. The need to
acquire multiple spectra for the same m/z values must be then balanced against the traditional goal of also
simultaneously examining as many unique peptides as possible. These
requirements place limits on the complexity of samples that can be
evaluated in an online fashion for isomer focused proteomics experiments.

In the present work, we describe characterization of isomeric PTMs
in sheep crystallins extracted from the eye lens. The results from
both RDD and CID on LC separated peptides were combined to improve
isomer identification. A short exclusion time and a target peptide
mass list were used to ensure that each peptide was examined multiple
times to allow for comparison of the relevant tandem mass spectra.
Three crystallin proteins (αA-, αB-, and βB3-crystallin)
were identified from the ovine database with excellent sequence coverage.
Several additional proteins that are predicted to be associated with
crystallin are also identified from the newly released sheep genome.
Many previously uncharacterized sites of isomerization for crystallins
were identified. The results illustrate that the greatest degree of
isomerization and epimerization occurs in the disordered N-terminal
and C-terminal regions of αA- and αB-crystallin, which
are abundant and important proteins in the lens that function as chaperones
and also serve as structural elements.

Experimental Methods
Materials
Organic solvents and reagents were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) or Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium)
and used without further purification. Water was purified to 18.2
MΩ by a Millipore 147 (Billerica, MA) Direct-Q system. Amino
acids and resin were purchased from Ana Spec (Fremont, CA). Trypsin
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

Peptide and
Radical Precursor Synthesis
All synthetic
peptides were synthesized manually using standard fmoc procedures
with Rink Amide Resin or Wang Resin for the solid support.33N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)
activated iodo-benzoyl esters were synthesized by a previously reported
procedure.34

Protein Extraction and
Digestion
Sheep eyes were obtained
from discarded tissue from Corona Cattle Inc. (Corona, CA). The lenses
were separated, washed with distilled water, and then homogenized
in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.8 buffer. The homogenate was centrifuged at
10,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was purified by
dialysis against water and lyophilized. The lyophilized protein was
dissolved in 50 mM NH4HCO3 buffer, pH 7.8, and
the disulfide bonds were reduced in 100 mM DTT at 95 °C for 5
min. After returning to room temperature, 100 mM iodoacetamide solution
was added and the mixture was incubated in the dark for 20 min. Then
proteins were digested with trypsin overnight at 37 °C, with
the protein-enzyme ratio at 50:1. For the iodo-benzoic modification,
the digestion mixture was first purified with a peptide trap (Michrom
Bioresource Inc.). Approximately 5 nmol protein digestion mixture,
15 μL of 15 mM NHS ester dioxane solution, and 5 μL borate
buffer (pH 8.6) were combined and incubated for 1 h at 40 °C.
Important: Note that dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) should not be used
for this step because it can easily cause aspartic acid isomerization.
The modification side products at arginine and tyrosine side chain
were removed by incubating the reaction mixture in 1 M hydroxylamine
(pH 8.5 adjusted by NaOH) for 4 h. The exact same procedure was performed
on control peptides. Since the deamidation and racemization of asparaginyl
and aspartyl residues are nonenzymatic spontaneous reactions that
can occur under physiological conditions,35 control experiments with a synthetic peptide (TVLDSGISEVR)
were performed to ensure that our sample preparation procedure does
not induce any isomerization. After reduction by DTT in 95 °C
and incubation with trypsin overnight, no isomerization was detected
by LC-MS (data not shown).

Mass Spectrometry and Radical Directed Dissociation
Solutions were analyzed by an LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) with a standard electrospray
ionization (ESI) source. The back plate of the mass spectrometer was
modified with a quartz window to transmit fourth harmonic (266 nm)
laser pulses from a Nd:YAG laser (Continuum, Santa Clara,CA). Photodissociation
of the labeled peptide homolytically cleaves the C–I bond in
the chromophore and produces a radical peptide. Further MS3 experiments were performed by reisolation and CID of the radical
species.

LC-MS Data Acquisition and Analysis
An Agilent 1100
series HPLC system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) with a BetaBasic-18
column (150 × 2.1 mm, particle size 5 μm) was coupled to
the LTQ mass spectrometer. Peptides were separated using 0.1% formic
acid in water (mobile phase A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile
(mobile phase B) with a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. The digestion mixture
was separated by the following gradient: 5% B to 20% B over 25 min,
20% B to 30% B over the next 35 min, 30–50% B over the next
15 min, and 50% B to 95% B over the final 10 min. The MS instrument
was operated in the data-dependent mode. In a CID-only LC-MS run,
the first scan event is full MS from m/z 300 to 2000 Da, followed by ultrazoom (scan event 2) and CID-MS2 (scan event 3). In a RDD LC-MS run, the laser pulses were
triggered during the MS2 (scan event 3) and the CID was
performed as a pseudo-MS3 step (scan event 4).36 Since the photodissociation of 4-iodo-benzoic
labeled peptide will always produce the radical peptide as the major
product, the precursor ion of CID in the MS3 step is the
radical species rather than the original peptide. The exclusion time
was 60 s for the identification of peptides and 16 s for the isomer
discrimination.

MS data were acquired with Xcalibur software
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). The raw files were converted to mgf files
by MM File Conversion. The mgf files were searched with X! Tandem
(version 2013.02.01.1) against the ovis aries database
UniProt 2014 06, 26,849 entries). The cleavage sites were set as lysine
and arginine (semi cleavage was turned on), allowing up to two missed
cleavages and one point mutation. Carbamidomethylation (+57.02 Da
at Cys) was set as fixed modification, and N-acetylation was considered
a variable modification. For the modified digestion mixture, the 4-iodobenzoic
acid modification (+230.01 Da) was considered a variable modification
at either the N-terminus or lysine side chain. The parent monoisotopic
mass error was set to ±1 Da and the fragment monoisotopic mass
error was set to ±0.4 Da. The minimum parent ion mass was set
to 400 Da. The criteria used for accepting peptides identification
is e < 0.005 for peptides. The false discovery
rate is 1%, calculated by searching the data against the reversed
database. Given that the content of the eye lens is ∼90% crystallin
proteins, the data was also searched against a smaller database that
contains primarily crystallin proteins. A few additional peptides
were identified in this fashion and their identities were confirmed
by manual assignment of the MS/MS data.

Calculation of R Values
To quantify
the isomer discrimination sensitivity, an R value
originally reported by Tao et al.28 for
chiral selectivity is used. In the present work, the R is calculated by eq 1. RA and RB represent ratios of the
relative intensities of a pair of fragment ions which varies the most
between two isomers. Therefore, Risomer = 1 indicates that the two tandem MS spectra are exactly identical
and no isomerization occurs. If Risomer > 1, a larger number reflects a higher probability of isomerization.
The statistical significance of the results is addressed in the Results and Discussion. In addition, we use an S value calculated in the same fashion to provide a quantitative
measure of the similarity of experimental spectra to those obtained
from synthetic standards. In the case of the S value,
the number should be smaller than the threshold. Although the same
formula is used in both cases, since the value should be higher in
one case and lower in the other, we have given them different designations
to avoid confusion. 1  

While comparing the tandem mass spectra
between synthetic standards and experimental peptides, the experiments
for unknown peptides and the standard peptides have to be conducted
in two separate LC-MS runs. More error arises from the different ionization
efficiency or other random uncertainties between different LC-MS runs.
Hence, to establish the S value threshold for positive
identification of peptide isomers by comparing the MS/MS spectra with
standard peptides, another set of standard LC-MS runs were performed.
Six S values were obtained by comparing the MS/MS
spectra acquired during different LC-MS runs of the same peptides.
The threshold for positive identification is 1.9 for CID calculated
from a standard t test (six S values are 1.63, 1.13,
1.58, 1.62, 1.72, 1.22) and 3.2 for RDD (six S values are 2.38, 2.02,
2.22, 3.21, 2.07, 2.70). See Supporting Information for additional details.

Results and Discussion
General
Approach
Our general experimental procedure
for identifying peptide epimers in a mixture of proteins is shown
in Figure 1. Following protein isolation and
digestion with trypsin, the sample is split into two pools and half
of it is covalently modified. There are two advantages to covalent
modification. First, the covalent modification allows for incorporation
of a chromophore suitable for converting the peptides into radical
species and analysis by RDD. Previous work has demonstrated that RDD
is the most sensitive method for epimer discrimination.29 Second, the covalent modification frequently
enhances the separation of epimers as is described in greater detail
below. There are also obvious disadvantages to covalent modification,
including loss of sample and additional experimental complexity. Therefore,
the unmodified samples are also analyzed using standard CID. Although
CID provides less ability to distinguish epimers, more peptides and
particularly those in low abundance are able to be analyzed. Given
that distinguishing epimers is a difficult task, it is also beneficial
to carry out the analysis using two independent methods. Both the
modified and unmodified samples are then subjected to a typical proteomics
LC-MS run using CID for the purpose of peptide identification.

Using this information, a target peptide list is generated and all
charge states of these peptides are then examined in a second LC-MS
run by both CID and RDD with a 16 s exclusion window. Multiple charge
states are examined because R-values frequently vary
significantly for different charge states. The 16 s exclusion window
is used because it enables the examination and re-examination of up
to four coeluting species within typical LC peak widths. Therefore,
every peptide on the target list will be examined multiple times,
even if it is only at the leading and trailing edges of a single LC
peak (see Discussion below for the significance
of re-examining the same LC peak). Although this strategy will limit
the complexity of sample that can be analyzed in a single run, it
should be possible to mitigate this problem by carrying out additional
runs (if needed).

mixture
by LC-MS/MS.

Isomer Separation
Comparison of potentially distinguishing
MS/MS spectra first requires that the isomers of interest be evaluated
independently of one another. Although separations can be carried
out with chiral media,37 isomers (including
epimers) can also be separated on traditional columns, which are more
frequently used.32 Incomplete separations
complicate analysis and make quantitation significantly more challenging.
Fortunately, the covalent modification that we use to install labile
bonds for RDD also changes the chromatographic behavior of the modified
molecules. An example of this is shown in Figure 2 for the peptide DAEFR, which is a small tryptic peptide from
β-amyloid. All of the four forms of aspartic acid (l-Asp,d-Asp, l-isoAsp, d-isoAsp) have been
detected in the human brain and the isomerization may be related to
the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease.38 Complete separation of these four isomers is difficult to achieve
because of their structural similarity.39 Figure 2a shows the LC chromatogram of mixture
of DAEFR, DAEFR, DAEFR, DAEFR (underlined residues corresponds
to d-amino acid and bold residues correspond to isoaspartic
acid). Only three LC peaks are observed because the l-isoAsp
and d-Asp containing peptides coelute. 4-iodobenzoic acid
(structure shown in the inset of Figure 2b)
is one of the chromophores that can be used for generating radicals
for RDD (IX will be used to represent the 4-iodobenzoic
acid modification of X, where X is any amino acid).34 Figure 2b shows the LC chromatogram
of the same four peptide isomers after covalent modification by 4-iodobenzoic
acid. All four DAEFR isomers are nearly baseline separated. In addition,
the elution times are shifted and the elution order is changed. It
is clear that the addition of the hydrophobic tag significantly impacts
the elution properties of DAEFR, leading to improved separation.

Some peptide isomers do not separate even after modification with
4-iodobenzoic acid. For example, in Figure 2c a single peak is detected for the peptide DVGSNK-NH2 despite the fact that two epimers (both d- and l-Ser) are present in the solution. Fortunately in this case the two
fragmentation spectra for the epimers are sufficiently distinct that
the presence of two species can still be detected. This is achieved
by examination of the leading and trailing edge of the LC peak, which
yields the corresponding MS/MS spectra shown in Figure 2d and an R value of 3.1. Analysis of these
same epimers when injected individually into the instrument yields
an R value of 13.29 It
is clear from this data that the epimers are still partially resolved
in the LC even though a single peak is apparent on the chromatogram.
For comparison, the LC chromatogram and MS/MS spectra for the leading
and trailing edge of a peak containing a single synthetic peptide
that was added to the sample are shown in Figures 2e and 2f. In this case, the two spectra
are virtually identical as expected.

acids, and bold residues correspond to isoaspartic acid.

Data Analysis
When attempting to
identify potentially
isomerized peptides in unknown samples, candidate peptides from different
LC peaks are selected if they have the same mass and exhibit similar
fragmentation patterns. In addition, the leading and trailing edge
of each individual LC peak is examined for differing MS/MS spectra.
In each situation, the R value is calculated from
the relevant tandem MS spectra. Theoretically, any Risomer value which is bigger than 1 should indicate the
presence of isomers. However, in reality, MS/MS spectra are not perfectly
reproducible (especially on the limited LC-MS time scale) and the
relative fragmentation abundances of the same peptide in two different
spectra acquired at different times are always slightly different.
Previous studies have reported that values of R >
1.2 are sufficient to indicate statistically significant differences
in spectra, based on the reproducibility of ion intensity measurements
from direct injection experiments.26 However,
in an LC-MS run, the error is higher because only a few scans are
averaged to obtain the MS/MS spectra for one peptide. In contrast,
spectra are usually averaged over 50–100 scans in direct infusion
experiments, which significantly reduces variation of the mean intensities.
To establish the relevant threshold for R values
reported herein, a standard LC-MS run was performed on a mixture of
synthetic peptides without any isomers using both CID and RDD under
identical conditions to those employed on actual samples. The R values for each peptide were calculated from two dissociation
spectra at the beginning and the end of each LC peak. Six R values were obtained this way for CID: 1.13, 1.20, 1.88,
1.55, 1.27, and 1.35. A standard t test was performed
and the 99% confidence interval corresponds to R values
from 0.94 to 1.85. On the basis of these numbers, we have set the
threshold to identify peptide isomers from CID fragmentation in this
work to R values >1.9. For RDD, the ion intensities
vary slightly more and the threshold to identify peptide isomers corresponds
to R values >2.4 (See Supporting
Information). Finally, to eliminate interference from chemical
noise, the relative intensities of the fragment pairs for the calculation
of R values must be higher than 10% of the base peak
in at least one of the two spectra. Furthermore, peaks assigned as
sequential fragments and 13C isotopes tend to have higher
errors and are not used to determine R values.

Localization of the isomerized residue in a peptide requires comparison
of data obtained from biological sources with standard peptides. In
these comparisons, the data for sample peptides and standard peptides
are acquired in separate LC-MS runs. Hence, more error arises from
different ionization efficiency or other random uncertainties between
different LC-MS runs. Similar metrics to those used to distinguish
dissimilar peptides from each other can be used to identify whether
two peptides are likely to be the same. Although the R value equation is used for the comparison, we will refer to similarity
scores as S values to avoid confusion. The criteria
in this case will be that the S value should be lower than the threshold, which will indicate that the two
peptides cannot be distinguished from each other and are likely identical.
To establish the S value threshold for positive identification
of peptide isomers by comparing the MS/MS spectra with standard peptides,
a set of standard LC-MS runs were performed as described in the Experimental Methods section. The threshold for
positive identification is 1.9 for CID and 3.2 for RDD. S values below these numbers will indicate that the peptides are likely
the same.

In addition to the types of amino acid isomerization
discussed
up to this point, there are a few other modifications that do not
result in any mass change that are worth mentioning. For example, cis/trans-proline isomerization can have
significant structural implications. However, this type of isomerization
is typically dynamic and it is unlikely that cis/trans-proline isomers of small peptides can be chromatographically
separated at room temperature.40 Furthermore,
our results do not suggest a bias toward identification of isomerization
for peptides that contain proline, as proline is present in both isomerized
and unmodified peptides. Another type of modification that could occur
in some rare cases involves two amino acids that are inverted in sequence,41 which could lead to separation of the isomers
by liquid chromatography. It is not anticipated that such isomers
will occur frequently enough to significantly impact our results,
and these isomers would be identified by analysis of the MS/MS data
if fragmentation between the relevant residues was observed.

Sheep
Crystallins
We applied the protocol described
above to examine crystallin proteins extracted from the eye lens of
an approximately one year old sheep. Three variants of crystallin
identified from the ovine database were examined in significant detail
(αA-crystallin, αB-crystallin, βB3-crystallin).42 A comprehensive list of identified peptide isomers
from these three proteins is provided in Table 1, which includes many isomers that have never been previously identified
(see Supporting Information for representative
mass spectra of some of the peptides). The sequence coverage, degree
of isomerization, and epimerization for these proteins are summarized
in graphical format in Figure 3. The sequence
coverage (orange bar in Figure 3) is excellent
for all three proteins. Areas that are missing are primarily because
of very short peptide fragments. The degree of isomerization is shown
for each protein in the blue bars of Figure 3. These bars represent the presence of any isomer that was detected
(presumably most are due to the presence of isoaspartic acid or aspartic
acid/serine epimerization). The degree of isomerization is highest
for αA-crystallin (62%), indicating that the most abundant protein
is also subject to the greatest amount of modification. αB-crystallin
and βB3-crystallin exhibit a similar degree of isomerization,
just below 50% of the total sequence. In the green bars in Figure 3, the extent of epimerization is shown. We consider
a peptide to be epimerized if the number of detected isomers is >4
for peptides containing two aspartic acids, >2 for peptides containing
one aspartic acid, or >1 for peptides that lack aspartic acid.
The
degree of suspected epimerization is again greatest for αA-crystallin.
Although it is possible that some of the isomers identified in the
blue but not green bars of Figure 3 could also
be epimers, this possibility is probably less likely given that aspartic
acid is the most likely residue to isomerize and the rate of isoaspartic
acid formation is greater than that of epimerization. Nevertheless,
it is possible for exceptions to exist. Additionally, a detailed list
of other identified proteins predicted to be crystallins in the newly
released sheep database is shown in Supporting Information Table S2.

Identification of peptide isomers
as outlined in Table 1, and Figure 3 does not reveal
the amino acid specific sites of isomerization. Previous work has
revealed that aspartic acid is the most likely site for both isomerization
and epimerization because of aging.14 Therefore,
peptides containing aspartic acid are likely modified at this residue.
Serine is the second most likely site to undergo spontaneous epimerization.20 All peptides that we have identified contain
either aspartic acid or serine or both. It is possible to positively
identify the site of isomerization by synthesizing synthetic standards
and comparing the respective MS/MS spectra, as detailed below. Importantly,
recent work has also demonstrated that ion mobility is able to pinpoint
sites of epimerization for some peptides, which may simplify site
identification in future experiments on crystallins.44 For the present study, we synthesized a small number of
authentic standards to compare with our results. TVLDSGISEVR
is a tryptic peptide from α-crystallin which separates into
3 peaks by LC (Supporting Information Figure
S1). By comparing the MS/MS CID spectra with those obtained from synthetic
peptides where all four different forms of aspartic acid were incorporated,
only the peak at 24.76 min is immediately identified as an L-isoAsp
variant with an SCID value of 1.3 (SCID <1.9 indicates high similarity, see description
above). The peak at 28.53 min is closest to the d-Asp variant
with an SCID value of 2.1 (which may be
above threshold due to the very low intensity of this peptide). The
peak at 26.59 min does not match any of the isomers well, with SCID values of 2.7, 13, 3.5, and 3.9 for l-Asp, l-isoAsp, d-Asp, and d-isoAsp,
indicating that the remaining two Asp isomers are coeluting or that
potentially the serine20 residue is also
epimerized. After iodo-benzoic acid modification, three peaks are
again detected by LC (Supporting Information Figure S2); however, comparison with the synthetic peptides by RDD
reveals that the three peaks represent l-isoAsp, d-isoAsp, and l-Asp with corresponding SRDD values of 2.6, 2.4, and 3.1 (SRDD < 3.2 indicates high similarity, see description above).
The greater structural sensitivity of RDD allows for more confident
assignment of the data (all relevant S values are
shown in Supporting Information Figure S2).
Taken together, the combination of RDD and CID confirms the presence
of all four Asp isomers and suggests that the most likely explanation
for the unidentified peak in Supporting Information Figure S1 is not serine epimerization but rather coelution of d-isoAsp and l-Asp.

The importance of using MS/MS
data in conjunction with LC separation
is further illustrated by examples extracted from the data in Table 1. For example, Ac-2AEQHSAPEQAAAGK15 is detected in a single LC peak, but the leading and trailing
edges of the peak are sufficiently distinct to confirm the presence
of two isomers. Furthermore, this peptide does not contain aspartic
acid, which suggests that epimerization at serine is the most likely
cause for the presence of two isomers. This hypothesis was confirmed
by comparison with synthetic standards containing d-Ser as
shown Supporting Information Figure S4. Similarly,
a total of seven peptides are detected as single LC peaks in Table 1, yet the MS/MS data confirm the presence of two
isomers for all of these peptides. If separation by LC alone were
used for isomer identification, modification of all of these peptides
would be missed. There are also situations where the number of peaks
that are separated by LC exceed the number of isomers that can be
confirmed by examination of the MS/MS data (for example 57APSWIDTGLSEMR69). It is possible
that CID may not be able to distinguish these isomers (although it
should be noted that failure to distinguish epimers has never been
observed in RDD experiments on synthetic standards). Another explanation
could be that coelution with another molecule may lead to observation
of the same peptide in two LC peaks. In such cases, closer scrutiny
is warranted to determine the true number of isomers.

Isomerization
and Functionality
The crystallin proteins
are primarily responsible for maintaining transparency in the eye
lens and are therefore critically important for eyesight. Crystallins
function as both structural and chaperone proteins, indicating that
modifications such as isomerization or epimerization may significantly
influence their effectiveness. The degree of isomerization for the
two most abundant proteins, αA-crystallin and αB-crystallin,
is shown in Figure 4 as a function of the structural
region of the protein. Both α-crystallins form dynamic assemblies
of larger oligomers where each monomer is comprised of three domains,
an N-terminal region, an alpha crystallin domain, and a C-terminal
extension. The terminal domains are largely disordered and thought
to mediate oligomer assembly, which is vital for chaperone functionality.
In Figure 4, the sequence of each protein is
represented by the color coded bar with aspartic acid and serine residues
indicated by black and white asterisks, respectively. Below each bar,
the degree of isomerization detected within each peptide is shown
(as determined by the total fractional abundance of isomers). It is
clear that αA-crystallin undergoes the greatest extent of isomerization,
with significant amounts of isomerization being detected in both the
N-terminal domain and the C-terminal extension. The alpha crystallin
domain, which corresponds to the ordered, globular part of the structure,
is isomerized to a lesser extent although some modification is noted.
αB-crystallin is less abundant, and appears to be modified primarily
in the N-terminal region. It is certainly possible that epimerization
or formation of isoaspartic acid could significantly perturb the delicate
structural interactions that regulate the overall oligomerization
state of the crystallins and significantly impact their ability to
function properly.

Figure 4 Isomerization ratio of αA and αB crystallins.
Different
colors indicate the three structural regions of crystallin, with the
N-terminal region in orange, the α-crystallin domain in blue,
and the C-terminal extension in purple.45 The black asterisks represent aspartic acid residues and the white
asterisks represent serine residues. The stars (peptide 89–99
in αA and peptide 124–149 in αB) indicate regions
where isomerization was detected but not quantified because of incomplete
separation by HPLC.

Conclusions
Although
direct comparison between different species and age groups
is difficult, the results outlined in Table 1 reveal numerous previously undetected sites of isomerization relative
to examination of human crystallin proteins from significantly more
aged samples.16 Given that isomerization
is known to increase as a function of age, it is likely that the methods
outlined herein would lead to identification of many additional sites
in samples of greater age. The results obtained for the crystallin
proteins illustrate that it is possible to identify nonmass shifting
PTMs by LC-MS/MS analysis in samples of significant complexity. Instances
of partial separation of isomers in these experiments serve to highlight
the importance of using MS/MS for isomer identification, otherwise
numerous isomers that fail to chromatographically resolve will be
missed. In addition, we chose conservative threshold values for epimer/isomer
identification, suggesting that there may be some additional epimers/isomers
that were not identified.

Results obtained on eye lens sheep
crystallins reveal that a significant
amount of isomerization can be observed even for a young animal. Both
epimerization of aspartic acid and serine containing peptides was
observed. The most abundant protein, αA-crystallin was isomerized
and epimerized to the greatest extent. Examination of the isomerization
in relation to the structural regions of αA-crystallin reveals
that modification is more prevalent in regions of the protein that
are not structurally well ordered. These modifications may impact
in the functionality of αA-crystallin and may be one of the
causes of age-related cataract. The greater isomerization of unstructured
regions may also suggest that natively disordered proteins in general
are more susceptible to isomerization, although this idea will have
to be examined in future studies.
