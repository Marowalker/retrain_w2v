The ability to acquire highly accurate
quantitative data is an
increasingly important part of any proteomics experiment, whether
shotgun or top-down approaches are used. We recently developed a quantitation
strategy for peptides based on neutron encoding, or NeuCode SILAC,
which uses closely spaced heavy isotope-labeled amino acids and high-resolution
mass spectrometry to provide quantitative data. We reasoned that the
strategy would also be applicable to intact proteins and could enable
robust, multiplexed quantitation for top-down experiments. We used
yeast lysate labeled with either 13C615N2-lysine or 2H8-lysine, isotopologues
of lysine that are spaced 36 mDa apart. Proteins having such close
spacing cannot be distinguished during a medium resolution scan, but
upon acquiring a high-resolution scan, the two forms of the protein
with each amino acid are resolved and the quantitative information
revealed. An additional benefit NeuCode SILAC provides for top down
is that the spacing of the isotope peaks indicates the number of lysines
present in the protein, information that aids in identification. We
used NeuCode SILAC to quantify several hundred isotope distributions,
manually identify and quantify proteins from 1:1, 3:1, and 5:1 mixed
ratios, and demonstrate MS2-based quantitation using ETD.

Top-down
proteomics methodologies
continue to evolve and can provide a useful alternative to the more
commonly used shotgun strategies for protein characterization by mass
spectrometry.1 Top-down experiments offer
many advantages, including the ability to characterize the entire
primary sequence of a given protein and identify combinatorial patterns
of post-translational modifications.2−4 The analysis of intact
protein samples is inherently more complex, complicating experimental
outcomes such as quantitation.5,6 Although many of the
same methods used for quantifying peptides have been used in top-down
workflows, there are unique challenges to quantifying intact proteins.

Label-free methods are the most accessible form of quantitation
for top-down experiments. Here, quantitative information is acquired
through the use of spectral counts or extracted ion chromatograms.7 These experiments, however, require many technical
and biological replicates to account for run-to-run variability.8 Label-free approaches also lack the ability to
multiplex several samples in a single run, a feature of some label-based
quantitation methods that can considerably reduce instrument run-time
requirements.9,10

Chemical labeling techniques
such as acrylamide labeling and tandem
mass tags have been used, but the complexity of intact protein samples
often leads to incomplete labeling and side reactions that complicate
the data analysis.11,12 Stable Isotope Labeling of Amino
acids in Cell culture (SILAC), which is a metabolic labeling technique,
is considered the gold standard for quantitative proteomics, and has
been used with affinity-purified proteins with some success.10,13,14 A drawback of this method, however,
is that even a small amount of incomplete labeling results in broad
isotope distributions that challenge quantitation.15 Furthermore, the spectral complexity from multiple isotopic
distributions for each protein hinders the ability to multiplex.

We have recently introduced a new strategy for protein quantification:
neutron encoding (NeuCode).16 Although
initially applied to shotgun approaches, NeuCode SILAC has the potential
to address many of the difficulties that the aforementioned quantitative
strategies have when used for top-down experiments. NeuCode SILAC
is similar in structure to a traditional SILAC experiment, except
that the distance between forms of the protein is greatly compressed,
such that they are indistinguishable during a medium-resolution scan.
Only upon using a very high resolution (>120k) scan are the separate
peaks revealed. NeuCode provides quantitative accuracy similar to
SILAC, but permits considerably higher multiplexing, because the quantitative
channels do not add to spectral complexity.16 In addition, comparisons between heavy labels, rather than between
light and heavy as in SILAC, alleviates the need to correct for isotopic
broadening and minimizes concerns about subunity reagent purities
of the heavy labels. Here, we present a first look at NeuCode quantification
of proteins from a top-down perspective in yeast.

Experimental
Section
Yeast Samples
For lysine NeuCode SILAC, Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BY4741 Lys1Δ
was grown in defined, synthetic-complete (SC, Sunrise Science) drop-out
media supplemented with either “K602” 13C6/15N2 lysine (+8.0142
Da, Cambridge Isotopes), or “K080” 2H8 lysine (+8.0502 Da, Cambridge Isotopes). Cells were
allowed to propagate for a minimum of 10 doublings to ensure complete
lysine incorporation. Upon reaching midlog phase, cells were harvested
by centrifugation at 3000g for 3 min and washed three
times with chilled doubly distilled (dd) H2O. Cell pellets
were resuspended in 5 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 8 M urea,
75 mM sodium chloride, 100 mM sodium butyrate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate,
protease and phosphatase inhibitor tablet), and total protein was
extracted by glass bead milling (Retsch). Protein concentration of
yeast lysate was measured by BCA (Pierce). The 1:1, 3:1, and 5:1 (K602:K080) yeast samples were mixed in the defined
ratios based on the BCA and all yeast lysates were desalted via a
tC2 sep-pak (Waters). The samples were dried down and then resuspended
in 0.2% formic acid.

Online reverse-phase chromatography was
performed using a Nano-Acuity UPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA). Proteins
were eluted over an analytical column (75 μm ID, packed with
30 cm of 5 μm, 300 Å Magic C4 particles, Bruker, Michrom)
at 300 nL/min using a 96 min gradient of solvent A (94.8% water, 5%
DMSO, 0.2% formic acid) and solvent B (99.8% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic
acid): 5% to 8% B from 0 to 1 min, 8% to 22% B from 1 to 45 min, 22%
to 30% B from 45 to 60 min, and 30% to 90% B from 60 to 96 min, followed
by a 4 min wash at 90% B.

Data were collected on an LTQ Orbitrap
Elite mass spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). The nitrogen flow to the
Orbitrap chamber was altered such that the increase in pressure (as
measured by a Penning ionization gauge) was ∼0.15 × 10–10 Torr, compared to the pressure in the absence of
nitrogen. Medium-resolution survey scans (30 000 resolving
power; 4 microscans) were used to guide data-dependent sampling of
the most intense peaks. Before acquiring the MS2 scans,
a high resolution (240 000 or 480 000, 4 microscans)
MS1 was acquired for quantitation purposes. Precursors
were fragmented with ETD (reaction time = 50 ms) and detected in the
orbitrap at 120 000 resolution with 6 microscans. Target ion
accumulation values were set to 3 × 106 and 5 ×
105 for MS1 and MS2 scans, respectively.
For all scan functions, the precursor ions
were isolated ±2.5 Th and peaks with assigned charge states of
1–3 were excluded from analysis. Dynamic exclusion was turned
off for the duration of the run.

Data Analysis
Quantification of unidentified isotopic
clusters was performed by constructing a list of unique MS1 features with the corresponding peak apex retention time. This was
accomplished by considering each peak in each MS1 in order
of decreasing intensity. Peaks above a signal-to-noise ratio of 15
and assigned a charge state were saved for future use. To ensure unique
clusters within an MS1, after the peak was saved all peaks
±5 Da of the saved peak were excluded. Then, the apex retention
time for each saved peak was calculated by assessing the intensity
of the peak within a window of ±15 MS1 scans. All
peaks representing unique clusters from each MS1 were then
ranked in order of increasing apex retention time. Starting with the
earliest eluting peak, peaks were saved to a final list of unique
clusters. To ensure clusters were unique, a ±5 Da exclusion window
was applied for all precursors with an apex retention time within
30 s of the peak that was added to the final unique cluster list.

For each unique cluster, the precursor intensity for the K602 partner was calculated using five high-resolution MS1 scans proceeding and following the apex retention time. The m/z values for potential NeuCode SILAC
partners were calculated assuming the number of lysine residues in
the protein was less than or equal to the charge state. The intensity
of the peak with the smallest deviation from the expected mass within
a 10 ppm window was summed for each potential partner over the same
MS1 range as the light species. Due to the lack of sequence
information, confidence in assigning the correct partners was increased
by ranking partners by the deviation from the expected ratio (e.g.,
1:1, 3:1, or 5:1). This automated algorithm was manually validated
to ensure accurate quantitation and partner assignment.

Results
and Discussion
As we did with peptides, we first explored
our ability to resolve
NeuCode SILAC-labeled intact proteins using a recently published dataset.17 A set of 1206 top-down protein identifications
(Kelleher) were examined to calculate the theoretical number of resolvable
NeuCode SILAC proteins at different label spacings. Briefly, for each
protein identification the number of lysine residues (N) were counted
and the expected m/z difference
between NeuCode pairs with 12, 18, and 36 mDa label spacing (Δm)
at the identified m/z value and
charge state (z) were computed as follows:  Next, assuming two Gaussian peaks of equal
intensities, we calculated the theoretical m/z spacing needed to resolve them at a full-width 10% (f) maximum (FWTM) for resolving powers (RP) between 15 000
and 1 000 000 (steps of 1000, RP defined at 400 m/z and scaled for identified m/z). For each protein identification and its observed m/z value, the theoretical m/z spacing needed to resolve a NeuCode pair was
calculated by  The percentage of quantifiable proteins (i.e.,
Δ(m/z)exp ≥
Δ(m/z)theo) was
plotted as a function of resolving power in Figure 1. Using the largest label spacing (36 mDa), over 84% of the
proteins are theoretically resolvable, and thus quantifiable, at 480 000,
a level achievable on commercial Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometers.
Lysine isotopologues spaced 36 mDa apart enable duplex quantitation.
We plotted all of the proteins, as well as the resolved proteins,
as a histogram of molecular weight, demonstrating that we can theoretically
resolve proteins even over 100 kDa (see Figure
1 in the Supporting Information). More closely spaced lysine
forms require higher resolving powers. Approximately 77% of the proteins
with NeuCode SILAC peaks spaced 12 mDa apart in the dataset would
be separated at a resolution of 960 000. This resolution can
be achieved on both Orbitraps18 and FT-ICR
instruments. Furthermore, ICR mass spectrometers are a common platform
for top-down proteomics, and many are capable of resolutions in excess
of 1 million, permitting routine use of the 12 mDa spaced lysines
and allowing 4-plex quantitative comparisons.19 We conclude that NeuCode SILAC quantitation of intact proteins is
obtainable for a large percentage of the identified top-down proteome.

Figure 1 Theoretical
resolvability of intact proteins incorporating lysine
NeuCode pairs from a top-down dataset. Using a top-down dataset of
1206 proteins, we calculated the fraction of resolvable peptides assuming
NeuCode spacings of 12, 18, and 36 mDa at the resolution required
to resolve the two peaks at full-width 10% maximum (FWTM), taking
into account the decrease in resolution as m/z increases.

We next used K602 and K080 lysine to
label
yeast from which we prepared top-down samples at mixing ratios of
1:1, 3:1, and 5:1 (K602:K080). At present, NeuCode
SILAC-labeled intact protein spectra are incompatible with existing
top-down search algorithms, complicating data analysis. To circumvent
this, we also prepared unlabeled yeast that we could search with ProSight.
Figure 2 illustrates a protein that was identified
from an unlabeled yeast sample and then matched to the NeuCode SILAC
sample, using the number of lysines and the retention time. The +9
charge state of the 1–47 fragment of ribosomal protein L26A
was identified, yielding a protein isotope distribution at an m/z value of 570 and consisting of ∼9
peaks at a resolution of 30 000. At this resolution, there
was no indication of the multiple forms of the protein that convey
quantitative information. However, upon acquisition of a 240 000
resolution scan, each single peak of the isotope distribution was
revealed to consist of two peaks corresponding to the two forms of
lysine used (Figure 2A). The spacing of the
isotopologue pairs revealed the number of lysines in the sequence,
aiding in the identification of the protein (Figure 2B).20 In this case, the distance
is 19.8 mTh and the charge state is +9, indicating five lysines. This
information, when matched with the retention time to an unlabeled
yeast sample, indicates that it is a fragment of ribosomal protein
L26A.

Figure 2 Quantitation of the 1–47 fragment of Ribosomal Protein L26A
from yeast using NeuCode. (A) The +9 charge state of the protein (Uniprot
B3RHL4) was analyzed first at a resolution of 30 000, which
shows one distinct isotope distribution. However, a scan at a resolution
of 240 000 reveals the presence of two forms of the protein.
(B) The spacing between the isotopologue peaks can be used to calculate
the number of lysines present in the protein. The protein is carrying
9 charges and the peaks are spaced 19.8 Th apart, indicating 5 lysines.
(C) Annotated fragmentation spectrum of the L26A precursor. The fragment
ions that contain a lysine also show pairs of peaks that can be used
to calculate the number of lysines. Two fragments (c5 and z18, ppm
errors of 6.40 and 6.56, respectively) were used as examples for quantitation
in all three samples, demonstrating excellent quantitative accuracy.

As shown in Figure 2C, the spacing in Th
between the isotopologue peaks in a fragmentation spectrum collected
at sufficient resolution aids in annotation by revealing the number
of lysine molecules present in the sequence, as well as providing
another avenue through which to acquire quantitative information.21 Figure 2C presents several
examples of fragments that contain two or three lysine molecules.
This information verifies the protein identification from the MS1 scan, as well as matching the quantitation of the intact
protein. We also used this information to aid in the identification
of Elongin-C from yeast in a previous experiment, as well as annotate
an ETD MS/MS spectrum of the +18 charge state precursor of histone
H2B (see Figures 2 and 3 in the Supporting Information).

We observed several hundred intact protein isotope distributions
in the defined ratio yeast samples. Due to the aforementioned difficulties
with database searching, we only identified a few of the MS/MS scans
by hand. However, this does not prevent us from extracting quantitative
information from the unknown distributions. Using a list of unique
isotopic clusters and the predicted number of lysine residues we calculated
the ratio of partners in each known ratio sample. Figure 3A summarizes the quantitation of all of the m/z peaks extracted from each sample, demonstrating
median ratios of 1.01, 3.02, and 4.58 for the 1:1, 3:1, and 5:1 samples,
respectively. Encouragingly,
our simple quantitative algorithm achieved excellent accuracy, even
though we did not have the benefit of the protein sequence. More than
500 species were quantified in the 1:1 and 3:1 samples; however, fewer
clusters were quantified in the 5:1 sample where the effect of stringent
filters employed during lysine prediction limited the number of detected
NeuCode SILAC partners. Future implementations of protein quantification
will utilize identified protein sequences removing the requirement
to predict the number of lysines and enabling the development of more-advanced
partner-picking algorithms. Using the same identification strategy
as above, we were able to identify the +12 charge state of ubiquitin,
based on its retention time and the number of lysines present. Shown
in Figure 3B, summing together the isotopologue
peaks yields ratios of 0.77, 2.09, and 4.27 for the 1:1, 3:1 and 5:1
samples, in relatively good agreement with the box plots above.

and true (dotted lines) ratios for all three samples is displayed
with the median (stripe), mean (square), interquartile range (25th
to 75th, box), and 1.5X interquartile range (whiskers). (B) Quantitation

Conclusions
We demonstrate the use of NeuCode SILAC to enable
multiplexed-quantitation
for top-down experiments. First, we demonstrated that the various
lysine isotopologues for NeuCode SILAC incorporate sufficiently (at
the intact protein level) in two disparate cellular systems. Second,
we provide evidence that NeuCode SILAC works identically to that observed
in our prior shotgun experiments—i.e., the multiplexed signals
are concealed under low to medium resolution scans and only revealed
upon analysis under high resolution. We conclude that these benefits
will circumvent the problem of MS1 spectral complication
that occurs with traditional SILAC for intact protein analysis. This
work provides a basis from which to continue NeuCode SILAC development
for top-down methodology. A current bottleneck is that top-down spectral
searching routines must be modified to accommodate the mass differences
and isotopic envelope shifts imparted by NeuCode SILAC labels; note
this lack of searching capability limited the current study to only
examples that we could manually identify. With these examples, we
demonstrate that the embedded NeuCode SILAC signals can be fully resolved,
even in the context of a protein isotopic distribution. We also note
that the high-resolution MS requirement of NeuCode SILAC is a condition
that is typically met in top-down workflows. In summary, NeuCode SILAC
has solid potential as a robust method for obtaining quantitative
data in top-down experiments and bypasses many of the drawbacks of
current top-down quantitative strategies.
