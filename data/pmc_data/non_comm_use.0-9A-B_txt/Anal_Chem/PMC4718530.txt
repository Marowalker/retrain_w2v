Certified
reference materials (CRMs) are required to guarantee
the reliability of analytical measurements. The CRMs available in
the field of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are characterized
using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). This technology
has limited application, because of its dependence on a calibrant.
The objective of this study was to obtain a method with higher metrological
quality, to characterize the CRMs for their contents of T-nos/hmg copy number ratio in maize. A duplex droplet
digital PCR (ddPCR) assay was developed and optimized by a central
composite design. The developed method achieved an absolute limit
of detection (LOD) of 11 cP T-nos, a relative LOD
of 0.034%, a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 23 cP (relative LOQ
of 0.08%), and a dynamic range of 0.08%–100% T-nos/hmg ratio. The specificity and applicability of
the assay were established for the analysis of low T-nos concentrations (0.9%) in several corn varieties. The convenience
of DNA digestion to reduce measurement bias in the case of multiple-copy
binding was confirmed through an enzymatic restriction assay. Given
its overall performance, this method can be used to characterize CRM
candidates for their contents of T-nos/hmg ratio.

==== Body
Cultivation
and commercialization
of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are regulated activities
around the world. Labeling is a requirement in several countries to
identify GMO-derived products when certain thresholds of maximum content
are exceeded.26 Reliable analytical quantification
methods, as well as certified reference materials (CRMs), are mandatory
to verify the fulfillment and correct application of these regulations.
The majority of CRMs derived from commercially available GMOs are
certified for their content of specific events as a mass fraction,
the international measurement unit adopted in the analysis and expression
of the results.15,21

In 2004, the European Commission
issued a recommendation proposing
the expression of GMO quantitative analysis results as a percentage
of genetically modified DNA copy number (cp) related to target taxon-specific
DNA copy numbers, calculated in terms of haploid genomes.6 For example, this recommendation is based on
scientific evidence that have shown the zygosity, parental origin,
and ploidy levels of the structural components of corn seed strongly
influence the results of GMO quantification, especially when expressed
as a mass fraction.22,25,27 However, these biological factors become irrelevant if the employed
reference materials (RMs) permit the quantification of GMO content,
in terms of the haploid genome copy number.3 Consequently, this measurement unit (copy number ratio) has been
used lately in CRM production.15 Nonetheless,
CRMs have been characterized using qPCR, which is the most common
method for GMO quantification3,15−17 and the characterization of their RMs.

To estimate the concentration
of the DNA target sequence, qPCR
determines the number of amplification cycles at which the fluorescence
exceeds a certain threshold (Cq) and compares it with a calibrant
of known concentration. This technique has important drawbacks: it
requires a calibrant be available and the possible differences in
amplification efficiencies between the calibrant and the material
analyzed. In GMO CRM characterization, plasmids have been used as
calibrant materials; however, this process is time-consuming and expensive.
In addition, this approach does not establish a direct traceability
to the International System of Units, which may lead to increases
in the uncertainties of the measurement and of certified value assigned
to the characterized material. Therefore, the use of methods with
higher metrological quality than qPCR is strongly recommended for
this purpose.

On the other hand, digital PCR technology is not
dependent on the
calibrant and presents a less restrictive amplification efficiency,
compared to qPCR, allowing for the absolute quantification of DNA
molecules from a sample, overcoming several limitations of qPCR. Because
of its measurement principle, digital PCR has been suggested as a
primary method for certifying GMO RMs for their copy number ratio.5 Although several studies focus on developing
methods for nopaline synthase terminator (T-nos)
quantification in corn and other matrices have been reported,9,10,14,20,23,28 no method
for amplification and simultaneous quantification of this element
and the high-mobility group (hmg) reference gene
is known, using either real-time PCR or digital PCR. The objective
of this work was to develop a reliable analytical method, optimized
through appropriate experimental design tools, showing suitable characteristics
for its use in the characterization of CRM candidates for their contents
of T-nos/hmg copy number ratio. T-nos was chosen because it is a common regulatory element
used for GMO screening at analytical laboratories, and it is one of
the five sequences proposed for authorized and nonauthorized GMO detection
in corn.24

Experimental Section
Experimental
Materials
For the development, optimization,
and validation of the method, maize seed-powder flour from the DMR
447 series of CRMs from the National Metrology Centre was used (CENAM,
México). This series is certified as a mass fraction for the
NK603 specific event: DMR 447 IIa (100% mass fraction), DMR 447 Va
(10% mass fraction), DMR 447 IVa (5%), and DMR 447 IIIa (1%). The
materials employed in the evaluation of the experimental specificity
of the method are described in the corresponding paragraph.

DNA Extraction
DNA was extracted from 100 mg of flour
of different materials, using a Fast ID Genomic Extraction DNA kit
(Genetic ID NA, USA). The extraction protocol followed the instructions
indicated by the provider, with some volume modifications (see Annex S1 in the Supporting Information). Genomic
DNA concentration was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 260
nm (A260), using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Jenway, U.K.). It was
considered that a value of A260 of 1.00 corresponds to 50 ng/μL
of double-stranded DNA. DNA purity was measured by calculating the
ratio of absorbance at 260/280 nm. Only samples with a minimum concentration
of 45 ng/μL and an absorbance ratio between 1.8 and 2.0 were
included in the assays. DNA concentration of samples tested, ranged
from 45 ng/μL to 100 ng/μL throughout all assays.

Primers
and Probes
The selected primers and probes
(Table S1 in the Supporting Information)
were described by Reiting et al.20 and
ISO 2157013 and were synthesized by Applied
Biosystems (USA). The quencher used in the probes was modified to
comply with ddPCR usage requirements.

Droplet Digital PCR
The analysis of samples (Annex S2 in the
Supporting Information) was based
on the Droplet Generator and Droplet Reader QX200 manuals (ddPCR,
Bio-Rad, USA). All the primers, probes, and reaction mixes were prepared
gravimetrically. For this process, MIQE guides were consulted.1,12 Positive and negative droplets were differentiated by applying a
manual fluorescence amplitude threshold (Figure
S1 in the Supporting Information). Copy numbers reported by
the droplet digital reader, were corrected to copy numbers/μL
of DNA sample, considering the dilution factor of the ddPCR reaction
mix.

Optimization
A central composite design (Table 1) for 3 factors and 20 trials
was used. The factors were T-nos primer/probe concentration
(T-nos), hmg primer/probe concentration
(hmg), and annealing temperature (Ta). Two experiments were run; one with the material DMR
447 IIa and the other with the material DMR 447 Va. A homogeneous
mix of DNA extracts was prepared for each material. From preliminary
explanatory results previously obtained at the laboratory (data not
shown), a high value (900/350 nM and 80/140 nM for T-nos and hmg respectively) and a low value (600/250
nM and 40/80 nM for T-nos and hmg, respectively) were established for the T-nos and hmg factors. For factor Ta,
temperatures of 61 and 59 °C were taken as high and low values,
respectively. A design matrix with 20 independent trials per experiment
was constructed (see Table 1, as well as Tables S2 and S3 in
the Supporting Information). The response variables were the T-nos/hmg copy number ratio (T-nos/hmg); the hmg copy number (hmg cp); and droplet separation for each analyte, measured
as the fluorescence difference between positive and negative droplets
(T-nos ΔF and hmg ΔF). The average of three replicates per
treatment and a nontemplate control (NTC) were registered for each
dependent variable.

A quadratic linear regression model was estimated
for each dependent
variable; then, optimal experimental conditions and/or acceptable
value ranges for each response variable were found, using a multiresponse
optimal analysis (by contour plots and the desirability function).
DNA concentrations estimated by spectrophotometry, maize genome weight,
and T-nos expected concentrations in the analyzed
samples, were used as reference to define acceptable values for T-nos/hmg and hmg cp variables.
The optimal experimental conditions of the method (primer and probe
concentrations and annealing temperature) were defined as those measuring
the expected T-nos/hmg copy number
ratio and hmg copy number, with the highest droplet
separation. The goal of the study was to find target values for T-nos/hmg and hmg cp,
and maximum values for T-nos ΔF and hmg ΔF within the established
ranges. All collected data were analyzed using the statistical package
Minitab v. 16.

Performance Assessment of the Optimized Method
Specificity
The theoretical specificity of T-nos and hmg primer sequences used in
this study was evaluated in silico, using the local
alignment tool (BLAST) from NCBI. To evaluate the experimental specificity
of the hmg detection method, DNA was extracted and
analyzed from two replicates of popping corn, blue corn, red corn,
white corn, yellow corn, soybean, wheat, and rice. Seeds of popping
corn, blue corn, red corn, and rice samples were acquired from the
local markets, while seeds of white corn were provided by the International
Maize and Wheat Improvement Center. The seeds were ground, sieved,
and dried at a particle size of 125–425 μm and humidity
lower than 2%. For the yellow corn, CENAM DMR 436 Ia (negative control
material for MON 810 event) and DMR 453 Ia (negative control material
for MON 88017 event) RMs were used. In the case of soybean and wheat,
DMR 495 IIa, DMR 495 IIIa (soybean positive control material for MON-04032-6),
DMR 496 IIa, and DMR 496 IIIa (wheat positive control material for
DREB1A) RMs were used.

To evaluate the specificity of the T-nos detection method, two replicates of RMs lacking the
sequence of interest—either for not being included in the transformation
event structure (DMR 436 Vb, MON810) or because the analyzed batch
matched the nontransgenic material of the series (DMR 451 Ia MON 863,
DMR 453 Ia MON 88017 and DMR 482 negative control material to p35S
and T-nos)—were evaluated. Materials corresponding
to events regulated by T-nos (DMR 447 Va (NK603),
DMR 451 Va (MON863), DMR 452 IIa (MON89034), and DMR 453 Va (MON 88017))
were also analyzed.

Detection and Quantification Limit
The goal of the
proposed method was to quantify the T-nos concentration
(in terms of copy number ratio) in maize flour. The copy number of
the reference gene (hmg) in the samples analyzed
was expected to be at least 18 000 for a DNA extract of ∼50
ng/μL; therefore, the detection and quantification limits were
performed only for T-nos, both in copy number and
copy number ratio in relation to hmg. The absolute
detection limit (LODabs) and the relative detection limit (LODrel)
were determined following the AFNOR (LOD6) guidelines.1 Four serial dilutions were prepared during 3
days, based on DMR 447 IIIa RM, using non-GM maize as a diluent. These
dilutions were analyzed in six replicates, together with DMR 453 IIIa
RM, covering a T-nos concentration range from 0.710%
(corresponding to ∼90 copies) to 0.007% (∼2 copies),
measured in maize samples with DNA concentrations of 65–100
ng/μL. Given the evaluation conditions, this range could also
be considered the asymmetric detection limit (LODasy), because the
setup was performed with hmg background levels of
25 000–37 000 cP, corresponding to an approximate
ratio of 1:2000 to 1:3500.

Dynamic Range (Linearity, Precision, and
Trueness)
The dynamic range of the method was evaluated from
the concentration
defined as the limit of quantification (LOQ) (0.08% T-nos/hmg ratio) to the highest available concentration
of T-nos, using DNA extracts of 45–90 ng/μL.
A five-point calibration curve was generated and analyzed in three
replicates obtained over 3 days, based on DNA extracted from DMR 447
IIa, DMR Va, DMR IVa, and DMR IIIa materials and a dilution of the
DMR 447 IIIa, corresponding to an approximate final concentration
of T-nos/hmg copy number ratio from
100% (16 500 cP) to 0.08% (23 cP). Nowadays, there is no reference
material certified for its T-nos content; therefore,
in order to evaluate the accuracy of the method over the analyzed
concentration range, the following analytical approach was used: the
event-specific NK603 was measured previously for DMR 447 IIa (100%
mass fraction) by digital PCR (data not shown), showing a content
of 50% NK603/hmg copy number ratio. Considering this
result and the presence of two linked T-nos copies
in the genetic construct of the experimental material (Figure 1), it was expected to measure
a 100% T-nos/hmg copy number ratio. Accordingly,
the certified mass fraction (event-specific) was selected as the theoretical
value for T-nos/hmg copy number
ratio. Values obtained from the three calibration curves analyzed
were plotted against the theoretical concentration, and the correlation
coefficient was determined. The dynamic range of the method was defined
as the concentration range where the response was linear (correlation
coefficient of R2 ≥ 0.98), precise
(relative standard deviation of ≤25%) and accurate (±25%).4,8

Applicability Assessment
Since the development, optimization,
and validation of the method was performed using yellow corn, the
applicability of the method to quantify T-nos/hmg was assessed in four additional corn varieties. To this
end, the DNA extracted from non-GM popping corn, blue corn, red corn,
and white corn was mixed with an aliquot of DMR 447 IIa DNA to obtain
a final concentration close to 0.9% T-nos with hmg background levels of 28 000–37 000
cP. The analyzed variety represented at least 97.5% of the final mix.
Each mix was analyzed in three replicates; the precision and accuracy
criteria were applied to establish the method applicability for every
variety.

Comparison of Duplex and Single Plex Assay
To amplify T-nos and hmg using the single plex method,
two reaction mixes were prepared. They were subsequently used to analyze
three replicates of the following materials: DMR 447 IIa, DMR 452
IIa, DMR 447 Va, DMR 447 IIIa, and a dilution of the latter to a concentration
near the LOQ value (0.08%). The copy number estimated for each analyte,
together with the T-nos/hmg copy
number ratio, calculated based on these data, was compared with the
results of the dynamic range curves generated using the duplex method,
through the bias assessment of each parameter.

Restriction
Enzyme Digestion
The material (DMR 447)
used for optimization matched the NK603 transformation event, whose
genetic construct is formed by two expression cassettes, each regulated
by one T-nos copy (Figure 1). To selectively separate the linked T-nos copies and to investigate the effects of fragmentation
on the quantification of the T-nos cp and T-nos/hmg copy number ratio, an enzymatic digestion assay
was performed. Three endonucleases (BamHI, EcoRI, and XhoI; Thermo Scientific, USA)
were selected through an in silico analysis; according
to the literature and databases, they could have restriction sites
outside the sequence of the analytes of interest and between the two
copies of T-nos, inside the NK603 structure, except XhoI, which was used as a negative control. To select the
endonucleases, the online tool Restriction Mapper v.3 was used, together
with the known sequences of T-nos (GenBank: AX342369.1; Section
8 from European Patent No. EP1167531),100hmg (GenBank: AJ131373.1), hsp70 (GenBank:
X03714.1), Ctp2-cp4-epsps (GenBank: KJ787649.1)
and P35S (GenBank: AJ007626.1); the theoretical restriction
sites on the genetic construct are shown in Figure 1. Prior to the preparation of the amplification
reaction and droplet generation mix, a DMR 447 Va DNA aliquot was
digested, first separately with each enzyme and next with all enzymes
simultaneously, according to the manufacturer’s suggestion
(see Annex S3 in the Supporting Information).
Based on the results of this assay, BamHI was chosen
to digest DNA aliquots from DMR 447 IIa and DMR 447 IIIa materials.
The fragmentation and analysis of DMR 452 IIa (MON 89034, 100% mass
fraction), which corresponded to a transformation event with a single
copy of T-nos, were used as controls. The copy numbers
reported by the droplet digital reader were corrected considering
the dilution factor of the digestion and/or the dilution factor of
the reaction mix, for digested and undigested samples, respectively.
Each extract was analyzed in three replicates; a comparison between
these results and the ones generated by the analysis of the undigested
DNA was performed by applying a Student’s t-test, based on mean differences analysis. The completion of the
digestion was verified using electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel.

Results and Discussion
Optimization
The linear regression
analysis for 100%
and 10% (DMR 447 IIa and DMR 447 Va) showed significative models for
three of the four response variables (T-nos/hmg, T-nos ΔF, and hmg ΔF) (see Tables S4 and S5 in the Supporting Information). In both cases,
the most influencing factor for T-nos/hmg and T-nos ΔF was the annealing
temperature (Ta). T-nos/hmg and T-nos ΔF increased when the temperature approached 58 °C, whereas, at
60 °C, T-nos/hmg started to
decrease, until reaching 0 during the 62 °C thermocycle (see Table S6 in the Supporting Information). The hmg droplet resolution (hmg ΔF) was primarily affected by the hmg primer/probe
concentration, although the annealing temperature also showed an inverse
effect on this variable. In this regard, two-dimensional (2D) plots
from QuantaSoft (see Figure 2) showed that, the T-nos/hmg positive droplet group (orange) was the most sensitive to temperature;
above 60 °C, the resolution began to decrease. In this group,
where T-nos and hmg coexisted in
a single droplet, they might be competing for the amplification reagents.
Apparently, increasing the annealing temperature above 58 °C
was detrimental to T-nos, leading to lower amplification
efficiency, lower fluorescence intensity and resolution, and, eventually,
lower estimated copy number.

the optimization of
the T-nos/hmg duplex ddPCR assay.

plots for each of the five evaluated temperature levels (58–62
°C) are shown. Each point represents a droplet with a given fluorescence
level; droplet colors indicate which target was amplified: T-nos (blue), hmg (green), none of the
two (gray) or both (orange). The x-axis shows the
fluorescence amplitude corresponding to the VIC fluorophore (hmg), and the y-axis represents the fluorescence
amplitude corresponding to the FAM fluorophore (T-nos).

The regression analysis for DMR
447 IIa showed that the hmg copy number remained
constant over the entire experimental
region, showing that the reference gene (hmg) can
be accurately measured from 58 °C to 62 °C, and the measured
value is not affected for the T-nos primer/probe
concentration. On the other hand, the regression analysis for DMR
447 Va showed that only hmg primer/probe concentration
had a significant influence (p = 0.066) on the hmg cp variable. However, the independent results of the
three measurements from the runs corresponding to different levels
of hmg (−1.68, −1, 0, 1, 1.68) show
variation in hmg cp at low levels (−1.68 and
−1) (see Table S7 in the Supporting
Information); this could be attributed to low droplet resolution,
which could lead to misclassification of hmg-positive
droplets in some cases. In this sense, hmg primer/probe
concentration could be considered to be an influencing variable on hmg cp, although not in the sense suggested by its regression
coefficient; the predicted increase on hmg cp when hmg primers/probe are diluted may have been due to an artifact
resulting from erroneous droplet discrimination.

Finally, multiresponse
analysis for both materials only included
the response variables T-nos/hmg ΔF, T-nos, and hmg ΔF; the hmg cp was excluded
from the analysis, since there was no appropriate regression model
for this variable. According to the desirability function plots (Figure 3), optimal conditions
were found at T-nos = 1.68, hmg =
1.68, and Ta = −1.5; with a composite
desirability of >95%. In natural variables, theses values correspond
to the 1000:384 nM T-nos primers/probe, the 95:160
nM hmg primers/probe, and an annealing temperature
of 58 °C, respectively. This result agrees with the overlaid
contour plots (Figure S2 in the Supporting
Information), which shows better droplet resolution and the expected T-nos/hmg ratio, at higher levels of the T-nos and hmg factors. From these plots,
it can be noticed that, at 58 °C, the T-nos/hmg copy number ratio predicted is relatively constant,
even when lowering the T-nos and hmg primer/probe concentration over a defined range, only affecting
the droplet resolution. Taking this into account and aiming to save
resources, it was decided to set the primer-probe concentrations at
the central level (750/300 nM for T-nos and 60:110
nM for hmg), for the performance assessment of the
method and the restriction digestion assay. We kept the annealing
temperature at 58 °C, since it showed to be the most influencing
factor over the response variables. It is noteworthy that the defined
optimal conditions were the same for both studied scenarios (100%
and 10%), which allowed working with a wide range of concentrations
under identical amplification conditions.

Specificity
Theoretical specificity of primers and
probes was evaluated through the NCBI database, using the nucleotide
sequences to run BLAST. The results are consistent with an extensive
list of records referring to the nopaline synthase terminator, hmg, recombinant vectors, and patents, confirming the complete
identity only with target sequences. To assess the experimental specificity,
all samples containing at least three positive droplets for the sequence
of interest were defined as positive. All the analyzed materials yielded
the expected results, in agreement with the information available
for each of them (see Table S8 in the Supporting
Information). No hmg amplification was observed in
materials other than corn, and T-nos amplification
was only present in event samples regulated by this element. These
results show the method is specific for the detection of T-nos and hmg.

Detection and Quantification Limit
The lowest-concentration
dilution at which all replicates were positive (at least three T-nos-positive droplets), regardless of the reading’s
accuracy or precision, was set as the detection limit.2 Similarly,
the lowest-concentration dilution at which all replicas, in addition
to being positive, reached a relative standard deviation of ≤25%,
with a percentage accuracy of 75%–125%, was set as the quantification
limit.8,18 Under these criteria, the relative limit
of detection (LODrel) estimated for T-nos was 0.034%, with an average background level of 32 000 cP
of hmg, indicating a fairly low limit, despite the
symmetry between the analytes; this corresponded to an absolute limit
fo detection (LODabs) of 11 T-nos cp.
The LOQ of the method was set at 23 copies. Taking into account the
intended purpose of the method, this value was considered as a satisfactory
limit, because it allowed for the quantification of T-nos from concentrations as low as 0.08%, with a background level close
to 28 000 cP of hmg (assessed condition),
or 0.12% with a background level of 18 300 cP of hmg, corresponding to the hmg cp expected in a DNA
extract of 50 ng/μL (most common concentration tested in routine
assays). In the case of RM production, this limit would allow for
the characterization of a material with a T-nos/hmg copy number ratio of ∼0.1%, offering the laboratories
the possibility to verify their analysis at this level, as required
by the European Union in regulation No. 619/2011.7

Dynamic Range
The response (T-nos/hmg copy number ratio) was linear
along the entire concentration
range evaluated (0.08%–100%), with a correlation coefficient
of R2 > 0.99 (see Figure 4). Since the concentration
of the highest
point of the curve was greater than the rest, this point was removed
to verify whether the linear trend was a consequence of a regression
damping due to that difference. Even then, R2 was >0.99, indicating the proportionality between the
response
and the T-nos concentration of the sample. Even though
the result variability increased while T-nos concentration
decreased, the CV values were far below the criteria (<15%). The
method’s accuracy satisfied the criteria established in every
evaluated point, although a measurement bias from approximately −6%
to −24% was observed. The achieved dynamic range allows for
the characterization of RM while covering almost the entire T-nos concentration range that is possible in a GM corn
sample, or at least the most probable concentrations.

ddPCR. Theoretical T-nos/hmg copy
number ratio (x) versus estimated T-nos/hmg copy number ratio (y).

Applicability
The estimate of the T-nos/hmg copy
number ratio was satisfactory for precision
and accuracy (see Table S9 in the Supporting
Information) at the assessed level (0.84%–0.99%) in all the
corn varieties analyzed (popping corn, blue corn, red corn, and white
corn). It was impossible to determine the method’s applicability
to higher concentrations, in these matrices or others, because this
type of RM is not yet available. The proposed duplex ddPCR method
can be used for T-nos/hmg copy number
ratio quantification in yellow corn, at the concentration range from
0.08% to 100%, and DNA extracts of 50–100 ng/μL on average.
The method could also be applied to analyze these targets in different
corn varieties, at least at low T-nos concentrations
(0.9%), complying with labeling limits imposed by the European Union.

Comparison of Duplex and Single-Plex Assay
The estimated
bias between duplex and single-plex assay application was <10%
(see Table S10 in the Supporting Information).
Although a certain bias increase was observed when the T-nos content decreased, the direction of that bias was not maintained
and no clear trend was detected. All results, except the evaluated
point with high concentration, show that the bias in copy number fraction
was produced mainly by the bias in T-nos cp, because
the estimated hmg cp was fairly robust, with a maximum
bias value of −1.8%. This result is similar to the result reported
by Morisset et al.18 In that study, the
single-plex version of a MON810/hmg ddPCR assay was
compared to its duplex version, obtaining a bias value of −1.8
for hmg cp, and ∼6% for MON810 cP/cp ratio.
Although the two versions were compared for a single concentration
level (0.7%), the authors concluded that no significant difference
could be observed between them. In our study, duplex and single-plex
results from five concentration levels, were compared for the T-nos/hmg copy number ratio using the Tukey’s
mean test, and no statistically significant difference between the
two assays (p = 0.498) was found. On the other hand,
no significant increase (or decrease) was observed in the variance
of the copy number evaluated by duplex ddPCR. These results show that,
in contrast to the single-plex version, the assessment of the T-nos/hmg copy number ratio was not negatively
affected by the simultaneous quantification of T-nos and hmg, indicating the reliable application of
the duplex version over the entire dynamic range.

Restriction
Enzyme Digestion
DNA digestion results
showed an increase in the estimated T-nos/hmg copy number ratio in digested DNA, on three out of four
enzymatic systems evaluated (Table S11 in
the Supporting Information), as expected. The T-nos/hmg ratio estimation was independent of XhoI digestion, proving that, in the tested samples, there
are no restriction sites for this enzyme between the two copies of T-nos. The estimated T-nos/hmg copy number ratio became closer to the expected value in the separate
digestions with BamHI and EcoRI
and in the multiple digestions assay, although a higher increase was
obtained using the first system. Sample digestion verification using
electrophoresis (Figure S3 in the Supporting
Information) revealed that nondigested DNA was also highly fragmented,
suggesting the partial unlinking of T-nos copies,
as a result of DNA extraction and sample manipulation. Qin et al.19 have reported this phenomenon and suggested
the use of DNA preamplification before molecule partitioning through
ddPCR, to separate tandem copies. Nonetheless, if the transgenic sequence
and the reference gene have different amplification efficiencies,
this alternative could introduce measurement bias.11

Since linked T-nos copies are expected
to be separated by enzyme digestion, the copy number ratio should
approach the certified mass fraction when DMR 447 IIa (100% mass fraction)
and DMR 447 IIIa (1% mass fraction) materials are fragmented, with
some variation from the expected values being possible, because of
he ploidy level and different tissue percentage contributions to the
corn seed, as previously reported.22,25,27 Digested DNA from all analyzed DMR 447 batches revealed
an increase in the estimated T-nos copy number ratio,
which was fairly close to the ratio expected taking into account the
aforementioned considerations; the estimated ratio remained unchanged
in DMR 452 IIa DNA, suggesting that linked copy separation produced
the increase observed in DMR 447 (see Table 2). This increase was heterogeneous between
different batches (an increase of 14%, 26%, and 36% for IIa, Va, and
IIIa batches, respectively); however, this result may have been altered
by the different extents of DNA fragmentation prior to digestion.
The DNA enzyme digestion has been shown to reduce the measurement
bias, proving it to be a convenient step for quantifying the T-nos/hmg copy number ratio, in materials
with linked T-nos copies.

Conclusion
This study describes a method for simultaneous quantification of T-nos and hmg and give details of the optimization
process using a statistically designed experiment. The proposed assay
achieved a limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ)
of 0.034% and 0.08% T-nos/hmg copy
number ratio, respectively, with a dynamic range of 0.08%–100%.
The measurement principle of the employed technology (ddPCR) and the
detection and quantification limits reached in the assay show that
this method can be employed to characterize candidates for CRMs for
their T-nos/hmg content on maize,
in terms of copy number ratio, over a wide T-nos/hmg concentration range. For this purpose, the genetic structure of
the transformation event in the analyzed material should be taken
into account, because DNA digestion may be needed in the case of linked T-nos copies to avoid underestimation of T-nos copy and copy number ratio. The enzyme selection will be dependent
on the transformation event and should be evaluated on a case-by-case
basis.
