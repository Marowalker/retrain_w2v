The ability to miniaturize biochemical
assays in water-in-oil emulsion
droplets allows a massive scale-down of reaction volumes, so that
high-throughput experimentation can be performed more economically
and more efficiently. Generating such droplets in compartment-on-demand
(COD) platforms is the basis for rapid, automated screening of chemical
and biological libraries with minimal volume consumption. Herein,
we describe the implementation of such a COD platform to perform high
precision nanoliter assays. The coupling of a COD platform to a droplet
absorbance detection set-up results in a fully automated analytical
system. Michaelis–Menten parameters of 4-nitrophenyl glucopyranoside
hydrolysis by sweet almond β-glucosidase can be generated based
on 24 time-courses taken at different substrate concentrations with
a total volume consumption of only 1.4 μL. Importantly, kinetic
parameters can be derived in a fully unsupervised manner within 20
min: droplet production (5 min), initial reading of the droplet sequence
(5 min), and droplet fusion to initiate the reaction and read-out
over time (10 min). Similarly, the inhibition of the enzymatic reaction
by conduritol B epoxide and 1-deoxynojirimycin was measured, and Ki values were determined. In both cases, the
kinetic parameters obtained in droplets were identical within error
to values obtained in titer plates, despite a >104-fold
volume reduction, from micro- to nanoliters.

==== Body
Quantitative
assays are at the
heart of biological and chemical experimentation. Large numbers of
samples must be interrogated when multiparametric spaces are explored
combinatorially to identify hits that cannot be rationally predicted,
for example, in drug discovery or protein engineering. Miniaturization
of sample sizes and automation of handling steps are practical imperatives
in making this technology affordable and available to a wider circle
of researchers beyond large companies who are not limited by capital
expenditure. Microfluidic or lab-on-a-chip technologies have shown
their potential in pharmacology, cell biology, and biochemistry.1−4 More recently, droplet-based microfluidics has become an increasingly
powerful tool for reducing and processing reaction volumes ranging
from microliters to nano-, pico-, or even femtoliters.5−15

Water-in-oil emulsion droplets are generated by mixing an
aqueous
and oil phase, using mechanical emulsification or, for superior control
over droplet size and composition, in microfluidic devices.16 These microcompartments replace the proverbial
test tube (or the more contemporary microwell plate) as reaction vessels.
Current droplet formation techniques, typically using flow-focusing
devices, allow the generation of very large numbers of droplets at
rates in excess of 10 kHz,17,18 and the setting up
of experiments in which large genetically encoded libraries on the
order of ∼106 members can be analyzed (e.g., in
directed evolution).8,11 However, large numbers of droplets
are less useful for experiments in which smaller libraries (e.g.,
compound repertoires that have orders of magnitude fewer library members
as compared to genetically encoded libraries) are used. In these instances,
compartment-on-demand (COD) platforms can provide an alternative to
bulk or flow-focusing droplet formation, and minimize reagent consumption
by sampling material into droplets or plugs at significantly lower
throughput (1–10 Hz). The lower droplet production rate presents
an opportunity to exert full control over the sequence and composition
of each compartment. Control over the compartment contents serves
as an alternative to encoding so that labeling steps become superfluous
and can be used for easy production of segmented concentration gradients.
Here, the confidence in the data obtained from each individual droplet
is the crucial basis for the reduction of droplet numbers (in turn
enabling lower reagent consumption) without loss in information quality.

Several COD platforms have been introduced in the past few years
and applied to combinatorial studies.19,20 On-chip platforms
based on valves21 or high-precision dosing
pumps that allow formation of droplets at the junction of multiple
inlet ports20 have been used to generate
microliter droplets with highly accurate reagent dispensing to generate
concentration gradients of analytes. Other platforms that generate
droplets directly from samples in titer plates in specific sequences
use valves to dispense these “droplet trains” for incubation,
which can be in tubing, or on- chip, and for further analysis.22 Continuous sampling of a PCR assay has been
realized using an automated platform for sample manipulation in which
500 nL droplets were sequentially formed into a droplet train via
a dual aspirating valve unit for injection into tubing. Using a commercially
available autosampler, kinetic analysis could be performed by drawing
samples to form 5 μL droplets, which were then split into smaller
droplets and mixed with other assay components to afford final assay
droplet volumes of over 800 nL.23 Such
valve systems allow control over the sequence of droplets, but result
in large plugs (assay volumes of 800 nL to 5 μL), imply slow
droplet generation (up to 30 s for one droplet), and incur a significant
risk of sample contamination within the valve itself.

A few
platforms generate droplets through the use of negative pressure.
For example, the DropLab24,25 and a study by Wen
et al.26 report the suction of aqueous
and oil samples to create concentration gradients via the sequential
uptake of the reagent droplets in the low nanoliter range. In the
former work with DropLab, reagents are mixed by sucking varying ratios
of liquid prior to flow segmentation with oil, whereas the latter
study uses merging elements to combine droplets. Although the use
of negative pressure eliminates the need for valves and allows formation
of much smaller droplets (20 pL to 3 nL), mixing aqueous solutions
in the DropLab system leads to potential contamination and the initiation
of reactions prior to droplet formation. Conversely, passive on-chip
merging allows precise timing of the fusion event, for example, through
pillar designs,27 although these designs
restrict to some extent the range of droplet volumes that can be used.

The current work seeks to overcome the technical complexity of
previous COD platforms and to maintain a high-quality readout, control
key operations robotically, and allow integration with liquid handling
system that are commonly used for compound storage and supply. We
achieve alternation of droplets and controlled merging without the
use of valves, multiple inlets, or a microfluidic chip, with control
and flexibility over the content, size, and number of droplets. The
processes that have to be precisely controlled are the supply of the
compounds tested and their dilution to determine functional data as
a basis for structure–activity relationships.

In our
COD platform, a robotic sampler generates a sequence of
microsegments (at a frequency of 0.2 Hz) and also governs their chemical/biological
payload, which can be varied over a series of compartments. A detection
module that interrogates droplets traveling inside the tubing to give
quantitative absorbance readouts expands the scope of optical analysis
beyond fluorescence. Accordingly, the time-dependent variation of
absorbance as a result of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction can be determined
in a droplet sequence and provides a quantitative read-out for a series
of reagent concentrations. Reactions were initiated by passive merging
of droplets directly in tubing by acceleration of the flow of droplet
pairs placed in close proximity to each other. Time-courses were extracted
by moving the train of droplets back and forth through the absorbance
detection module. The programmable and robotic control of the COD
platform allows the creation of a sequence of microfluidic aqueous
segments with defined volumes, frequencies, and interdroplet spacings.
High-quality data were obtained for the enzymatic hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl
glucopyranoside by sweet almond β-glucosidase: time-resolved
kinetics for individual droplets with different substrate concentrations
were used to derive kcat and KM values within 20 min in a single run, with full automation
from droplet generation to data collection.

Results and Discussion
A Robotic
COD Platform
The COD platform (Figure 1) creates user-defined sequences of droplets with
control over content and volume. Specifically, it transforms aqueous
samples into individual microcompartments by continuous suction of
fluid into PTFE tubing (200 μm ID) from different samples loaded
in a carousel. Currently, the minimum sample volume needed to generate
droplets is ∼20 μL, which provides a layer deep enough
for the tubing to be immersed while in the “up” position.
To form droplets of a given sample, a solenoid controlling the vertical
motion of the end of a section of tubing withdraws either oil or sample
(placed in bottomless PCR tubes) from below (Figure 1B), turning the aqueous stream into an alternating sequence
of droplets. In the “down” position, the tubing is fully
immersed in the oil phase, while in the “up” position,
its tip is inside the aqueous phase. The PTFE tubing and the oil phase
are matched in their interfacial properties, and so upon retraction
from the aqueous sample the tubing is free of any aqueous contamination.

Figure 1 (A) Schematic
of the compartment-on-demand platform. Samples (in
bottomless tubes) are supplied by rotating an oil-filled carousel.
Samples are withdrawn when a sample tube aligns to PTFE tubing located
underneath. Negative pressure is applied via a syringe pump operating
in continuous withdrawal mode, and droplet compartments are generated
by moving the tubing up and down between the carrier phase and the
aqueous phase, as shown in (B). The residence time of the hooked end
of the tubing in oil or aqueous phase determines the distance between
droplets and the droplet volume, respectively. The absorbance of each
microdroplet is read by passage between an LED source aligned with
a photodetector (PD). A typical data trace is shown in the top right
(see Figure 2A) showing absorbance data for
droplet sequences with different compounds (corresponding to different
colors) and concentration gradients (indicated by shading of each
color). (B) Sequential operation of the COD platform. During all steps
of operation, the tubing is aspirating liquid at a constant rate.
(i) The tip of the tubing is aligned with a given sample. (ii) The
tip is lifted so that it sits in the aqueous phase of sample 1 (red).
(iii) The tip returns to the oil phase. The change from aqueous to
oil phase creates a microcompartment containing a controlled quantity
of sample 1 (red). (iv) The tip is aligned below a second sample.
(v) The tip is lifted analogously to step (i), but now sample 2 (blue)
is taken up. (vi) The tip comes back to the carrier fluid. As a result
of the process shown in (B), a sequence of microdroplets with defined
contents (sample 1, red; sample 2, blue) emerges in the tubing in
a preplanned order. Droplets can be generated at a rate of 0.1–5
s per droplet. No further labeling is necessary as the sequence of
sample compartmentalization can be programmed and droplets appear
in the tubing as planned. Control over compartment volume and the
distance between compartments is exerted by variation of the residence
times of the tip in aqueous and oil phases.

Varying concentration and thus mixing specific volumes of
different
reagents requires precise control over droplet size in our COD platform.
To do so, the size of the droplet (created from the aqueous phase)
and the distance between droplets (created by the oil phase) were
controlled by varying the residence times in each phase. The size
of each microsegment was measured to determine the accuracy of droplet
formation, and observed volumes were compared to theoretical volumes
(Figure S4, Supporting Information). Relative
standard deviations of the droplet lengths were typically less than
10%. This deviation is caused by the inherent pulsing of the syringe
pump. For kinetic experiments, the actual sizes of droplets produced
were extracted from their “absorbance signature”, and
these values, rather than the theoretically expected volumes, were
used in the determination of kinetic parameters.

Absorbance
Measurements
A large number of conventional
enzymatic assays rely on UV–Vis spectrophotometric detection
of a chromophore-containing product. Unfortunately, miniaturization
of optical path-lengths results in decreased absorbance in accordance
with the Beer–Lambert law. This is not a limitation for fluorescence-based
measurements, and thus absorbance detection has only been used sparingly
in microfluidic assays. Examples of such studies include a coupled
assay to measure alcohol oxidation kinetics using disc microfluidics
with a 10 mm path length,28 glucose detection
through a 475 μm-long droplet,29 pH
sensing by recording absorbance movies through a 27 μm optical
path,30 and dye calibration through 500
μm diameter tubing.20 As in the latter
reference, we have implemented absorbance-based detection using a
custom-made polymeric holder that serves to align the light source
and detectors accurately across the tubing. This configuration bypasses
the need for microfluidic chips in which fibers are embedded31 and provides a simple solution for optical detection.
A typical read-out is shown in Figure 2A. Fiber core sizes were assessed for their signal-to-noise
ratio, with the optimal design having a core diameter of 200 and 50
μm for connection to the light source and the detector, respectively.
These fiber sizes were used for all subsequent experiments unless
stated otherwise.

Figure 2 (A) Quantifying absorbance in droplets. A typical trace
of an absorbance
read-out (A405 nm) for two droplets
(representing sample-loaded and empty compartments) flowing through
a PTFE tubing (200 μm diameter). The first signal refers to
a droplet containing 4-nitrophenol (2 mM) in PBS buffer, and the second
containing buffer only. Each droplet was interrogated with an LED
source with a peak emission at 405 nm. L defines
the residence time of the droplet in the detection zone and corresponds
to the length of the droplet. AA is the average absorbance
of the droplet contents. The recovered signal for buffer droplets
corresponded to the highest voltage and was defined as zero absorbance
(Z). In this example, the continuous oil phase had
an absorbance A405 nm of approximately
0.02. The signal spikes (at the droplet extremities) are a result
of edge effects that are brought about by refractive index changes
between the aqueous and oil phases. (B) Calibration of the absorbance
detection with 4-nitrophenol. Premade dilutions were introduced into
the loading tubes of the carousel, and the droplet absorbance was
read for each condition (n = 5). The data correlate
linearly (R2 of 0.99), and the detection
limit (three standard deviations above the background noise) suggests
that measurements down to 3 μM 4-nitrophenol are possible.

On the basis of a typical reading
(as shown in Figure 2A), both the residence
time and the average absorbance
for each droplet can be retrieved by postprocessing raw data. On the
basis of the known flow rate, the residence time of a given droplet
across the detection zone can be converted into a volume (Figure S4). Droplet size was determined using
the edge effects for solutions of low absorbance. In addition, the
average transmittance for PBS buffer alone is higher than the base
transmittance through the oil and was therefore used as a blank for
correction of the absorbance baseline. To assess the sensitivity and
limit of detection of the described implementation, dilutions of 4-nitrophenol
were pipetted into the loading tubes and transformed into microsegments.
Five readings were taken for each condition and averaged. The absorbance
read-out (Figure 2B) shows excellent linearity
(R2 of 0.99) as a function of dye concentration
with a concentration detection limit approximately 3 μM of 4-nitrophenol
(corresponding to three standard deviations of the background noise).
This compares favorably with other embodiments of absorbance detection
in microfluidic systems (e.g., 13 μM with a 28 μm path
length)32 and, for the assay presented
herein, is more than sufficient to extract quantitative information
(from enzyme turnovers that give rise to product concentrations in
the micromolar to millimolar range).

Creation of Linear Gradients
The creation of controlled
dilution gradients is crucial when performing quantitative assays
that provide accurate enzyme kinetic data for subsequent structure–activity
relationships. To generate linear concentration gradients, microdroplet
pairs were generated at a low flow rate (10–20 nL/s) with the
first droplet being smaller than the following droplet and separated
by a short oil plug. Once all of the droplet pairs were produced,
the flow was halted and then accelerated to a flow rate of 300 nL/s.
This resulted in paired droplets getting closer to each other, due
to an imbalance of oil leaking through the corner gutters of both
droplets, which behave as leaky pistons.19,20,33 The size of the oil plug between the two
droplets gradually decreased until the continuous phase completely
drains and droplets were able to coalesce. This process was visualized
and is detailed in the Supporting Information (Figure S5).

By programming the frequency of the up/down motion
of the solenoid, droplet pairs of different size ratios were generated.
Linear gradients were automatically created so that each droplet pair
corresponded to a unique size combination. The total volume of the
merged pairs was kept constant at approximately 60 nL. In this setup,
the time taken to create a droplet was 0.1–5 s (representing
>10-fold faster droplet generation as compared to DropLab24,25). Using the software controlling the COD platform, automated generation
of 50 droplet pairs and subsequent merging in tubing was shown (see
Figures S7, S8, Supporting Information).
Every droplet pair successfully merged. The parameters for merging
were examined and showed a dependence on the volume of the oil plug
separating droplet pairs with optimal fusion at minimum oil volume
(<5 nL). Moreover, the range over which a concentration gradient
can be produced is defined by the size ratio between the smaller first
droplet and the larger second droplet. In the current studies, the
largest dilution ratio used was 1:5 with a volume of the smallest
droplet of 10 nL. Finally, it should be noted that the frequently
employed method of serial dilution, that is, multiple sequential dilution
steps by the same factor, makes it hard to obtain as good coverage
of a concentration range as in Figure 3C, which
in turn often precludes acquisition of data good enough for quantitative
analysis in structure–activity relationships.

large compartment loaded with enzyme (E) will catch up with a smaller
compartment loaded with substrate (S) placed immediately in front

the droplet sequence. (i) Four sets of six droplet pairs of enzyme
(E) and substrate (10 and 50 mM, referred to as S10 and
S50, respectively) of varying sizes were produced. (ii)
The enzyme/substrate droplets were analyzed shortly after generation,
and prior to merging, to determine the precise size of each droplet.
Sizes were measured by determining the distances Ls (length of the substrate droplet) and Le (length of the enzyme droplet) as described previously.
The illumination source was a cold white LED, and the fiber core sizes
for illumination and detection were 100 and 50 μm, respectively.
(C) Automated concentration gradient. The substrate concentration
range after mixing of all droplet pairs was 1.3–38.2 mM. The
color code relates the data points in (C) to the primary data in (B)(i).

Programmed Automation
All of the steps including droplet
formation, confirmation and sizing of the droplet sequence, triggering
of the merging, and back and forth measurement were implemented in
a single program. The schematic of the program is shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 The automated workflow programmed to run kinetic assays.
Schematic
diagram of the four steps that provide a full set of Michaelis–Menten
data: (1) loading of the droplet pairs corresponding to different
points of the Michaelis–Menten plot; (2) confirming and sizing
of the droplet pairs prior to fusion; (3) droplet merging in tubing
initiates the reaction; and (4) droplets are moved back and forth
for reading of the reaction progress by absorbance. Such readings
can be repeated many times until the reaction has advanced sufficiently
to describe a full time-course. The ability to carry out as many measurements
as necessary makes this system amenable to most reactions (with time
scales from a minute to several hours or more). The sizing data (step
2) and the data for the time-courses (step 4) were stored in individual
files. This process can be repeated for multiple samples that are
sequentially supplied from the carousel of the robotic sampler (Figure 1A).

Enzyme Kinetics in Droplets
The hydrolysis of the chromogenic
substrate 4-nitrophenyl glucopyranoside by sweet almond β-glucosidase
was chosen as a model reaction for monitoring the action of a typical
hydrolytic enzyme and deriving Michaelis–Menten parameters.
Reaction rates with a range of substrate concentrations were followed
over time, and initial rates, Vo, were
determined. Each substrate concentration corresponds to a combination
of enzyme and substrate samples that are fused in different volume
ratios. Two substrate stock concentrations (10 and 50 mM that are
diluted in ratios up to 1:5) were needed to generate a substrate concentration
range between 2 and 40 mM (see Figure 3). These
stock solutions and an enzyme stock (at 78 nM) were loaded in three
adjacent wells in the carousel (Figure 1) and
used to generate pairs of droplets containing enzyme and substrate
(Figure 3A). Once all of the pairs were loaded
in sequence, merging was triggered. The first reading was taken after
approximately 30 s (as shown in Figure 5A).
To precisely account for size variation and confirm that the planned
sequence of droplets was indeed generated, an absorbance detection
system was positioned close to the site of droplet formation to monitor
droplet lengths, which in turn were used to derive the precise enzyme
and substrate concentration for each mixture. This initial reading
is shown in Figure 3B(i), and an expansion
showing a single droplet pair is shown in Figure 3B(ii). The resulting screening range for substrate concentration
is displayed in Figure 3C.

Figure 5 Derivation of Michaelis–Menten
plots from primary data.
(A) Confirmation of fusion of droplet pairs and initial assay reading.
The first data point was measured 30 s after initiating the acceleration
to cause merging. The LED used for these absorbance measurements emitted
at 405 nm. The color code corresponds to the same data points as in
Figure 3. (B) Time-resolved measurements of
average absorbance value for each assay point, with corresponding
linear fits superimposed. Initial readings were set to zero volts
to highlight the diversity of slopes. The color code corresponds to
the droplets displayed in Figures 3B,C and 4A. (C) Michaelis–Menten plot based on 24
substrate concentrations extracted from the data in (A) and (B). The
values for Vo are obtained by converting
the voltage change per time into a concentration change per time and
then dividing these values by the enzyme concentration. Colors correspond
to the dilution set of Figure 3 and groups
of initial rates in Figure 4B. Error bars shown
represent the error in the linear fits shown in Figure 4B.

For measuring further time points,
two marker droplets (containing
1 mM 4-nitrophenol) loaded at the front and the rear of the sequence
trigger the automated reversal of the flow direction. Consequently,
the droplet sequence flowed back and forth passing the absorbance
reader. Absorbance measurements for individual droplets were recorded
for each passage through the detector (Figure
S9). These time points were then assembled into time-courses
(Figure 5B) for each droplet in the known sequence
(Figure 5B).

On the basis of the accurate
size information for the substrate
and enzyme droplets, the true concentrations of enzyme and substrate
in each reaction droplet were determined and used to convert the initial
rate data shown in Figure 5B into a Michaelis–Menten
plot as shown in Figure 5C. It was found that
in the droplets a background reaction of spontaneous substrate hydrolysis
(at the oil/water interface) gave rise to a linear increase in product
concentration (Figure S10). Accordingly,
the initial slopes were corrected for spontaneous hydrolysis before
conversion to turnover numbers. The data obtained were modeled with
the Michaelis–Menten equation yielding the kinetic parameters
of KM = 11.4 ± 2 mM and kcat = 0.9 ± 0.2 s–1. These values
are in close correspondence with those determined in a microtiter
plate (KM = 12.8 ± 4 mM and kcat = 1.3 ± 0.3 s–1 (shown
in Figure S11)). The total volume necessary
to describe a Michaelis–Menten plot was 720 nL of enzyme stock
and 360 nL for each substrate stock solution (50 and 10 mM).

Inhibition
Our approach was subsequently extended to
a ternary combination of reagents and exemplified with inhibition
studies for a known inhibitor of β-glucosidase, 1-deoxynojirimycin
hydrochloride (DNM).34 To obtain Michaelis–Menten
kinetic plots in the presence of the inhibitor, different concentrations
of inhibitor and substrate were pipetted into the loading tubes. Drawing
samples from these stocks allowed easy screening of inhibitor concentrations
spanning 3 orders of magnitude and demonstrated full use of all 15
loading slots in the current carousel. Here, triplets were created
to combine enzyme, substrate, and inhibitor with the final substrate
droplet representing 50% of the final volume to ensure reproducible
merging of the triplets. A schematic for triplet droplet merging is
shown in Figure 6A. Michaelis–Menten
plots for different inhibitor concentrations are shown in Figure 6B.

Figure 6 Determination of inhibition kinetics. (A) Schematic for
triplet
droplet merging. (B) Michaelis–Menten plot in the presence
of selected concentrations of 1-deoxynojirimycin hydrochloride (DNM).
The final concentrations of inhibitors were 200 μM (dark gray),
20 nM (cyan), 200 pM (brown), and 0 nM (purple). Here, enzyme concentration
was fixed at 16.5 nM. (C) Normalized rate change V0/V0max versus
inhibitor concentration for DNM (blue dots) and CBE (green dots).
The data points for DNM were fitted to generate an IC50 (see text for details). For CBE a line was drawn merely to guide
the eye. Conditions: [E] = 19 nM; [S] = 23 mM; [PBS] = 100 mM (pH
7.4).

Subsequently, rates in the presence
of a fixed substrate concentration
and varying concentrations of DNM and Conduritol B Epoxide (CBE) were
measured. We followed inhibition at high substrate concentrations
(23 mM) to maximize product formation. The ratio between the maximum
initial rate (with no inhibitor) and the initial rate at different
inhibitor concentrations is represented in Figure 6C.

From these data, the IC50 for DNM was
determined to
be 108 ± 40 μM by fitting to eq 1:35 1  

This inhibition constant corresponds to an approximate Ki value of 36 μM, assuming competitive
inhibition and using the Cheng–Prusoff equation.36 This correlates well with the literature value
for Ki of 47 μM.34 The data set for CBE cannot be used for fitting because
CBE is an irreversible inhibitor, but the observed inhibition is consistent
with microtiter plate readings (cf., Figure S13).37

Implications and Conclusions
Miniaturization
The COD platform can perform automated
enzyme kinetic experiments without supervision and generate data comparable
in quality to microtiter plate readings, but works with much smaller
quantities of reagents (e.g., 720 nL of enzyme vs 240 μL in
a 96-well plate for 24 data points). Our COD platform also compares
favorably with other COD platforms used for kinetic assays. For example,
although the DropLab24,25 system has been claimed to operate
with 2 nL per reaction (although larger droplets are typically displayed
in ref (24)) and previously
described valve systems23 consume 188 nL
of enzyme per data point, the current COD platform uses an average
of 30 nL of enzyme per data point. Miller et al.35 successfully carried out a screen of small molecule enzyme
inhibitors in 140 pL droplets. However, the confidence in the data
obtained from each single droplet measurement was so low that more
than 10 000 data points were needed to a construct a reliable
binding curve.35 Massive statistical averaging
allowed quantitative interpretation of a scattered data set to obtain
an IC50 value. Our COD system takes the completely different
approach of maximizing the information extracted per unit volume,
so that 500-times fewer data points are needed. Precise control over
droplet size and derivation of time-courses (rather than single point
assays) are responsible for data quality being equivalent to cuvette
or microplate experiments. This increase in data quality is obtained
at the price of a 5000-fold larger droplet volume (720 nL vs 140 pL),
so that the approach of Miller et al. consumes on balance about 10-times
less reagent to obtain a binding curve. When minimization of reagent
consumption is key, this system will be preferred. Nevertheless, when
single species, such as cells,38−40 of limited availability are to
be interrogated (so that the number of droplets determines their consumption)
and time-dependent data must be obtained, then the current COD platform
becomes the method of choice. Furthermore, the larger volumes of COD
platforms allow absorbance measurements for which the light path in
smaller droplets is too short, enabling a range of assays for which
there are no convenient fluorescence-based alternatives. Regardless,
each of the above platforms has obvious advantages as compared to
typical kinetic assays in titer-plates: (i) more data points can be
obtained with less reagent (in our case, the volume reduction from
microliter to nanoliter is in excess of 104-fold), (ii)
fewer pipetting steps (20 times fewer for the data shown in this work)
are needed as they are replaced by automated volume calculations and
liquid handling without the expense that industrial facilities attract
in capital expenditure and maintenance; and (iii) single species experiments
can be carried out with data quality that is of quality similar to
that of normal large-scale experiments.

Spatial Encoding
Previous droplet screening systems
have frequently made use of dyes that provided information about the
concentration and/or identity of the contents of the droplet.23,35,38,41,42 By contrast, no labels are needed in the
described platform, because the sequence of droplets is entirely programmable.
Once the sequence is set, only simple back-and-forth movements are
necessary for detection with no disturbance in droplet order being
observed. The approach of sequential encoding greatly reduces the
technical complexity of the assay and obviates the need for multiple
detection schemes. Ultimately, reliance on coding dyes will limit
the numbers of compounds that can be screened because there are a
finite number of available dyes that can be optically distinguished.
Before our COD system described here can be applied to a combinatorial
screen, further engineering of the compound supply (via the carousel
and its integration with conventional liquid handling systems) will
be necessary to carry out automated large-scale experiments.

Droplet
Handling without Chips
Performing the entire
assay within tubing eliminates problems tied to integration of droplet
generation and handling in microfluidic chips, such as the stability
of droplet generation or insertion of a sequence of “droplet
trains” through valves. No chips had to be designed and fabricated
for this study, although our system can be easily integrated with
chips while maintaining a specific droplet sequence, if desired.26 The program that controls robotic droplet formation
is readily adjusted to set the number and size of the droplets to
be merged. Moreover, this work establishes a new method to merge droplets
by exploiting hydrodynamic flow properties that lead to droplet fusion
based on size difference and does not require additional features
provided in planar chip formats. Relying on full control over droplet
size allows the on-demand generation of varied concentrations of droplet
contents. In the inhibition screen, we describe how we merged three
droplets with premixed inhibitor concentrations to demonstrate full
use of all wells available in the carousel. However, quadruplet combinations
of enzyme, substrate, inhibitor, and buffer could be merged to create
inhibitor dilutions in a fully automated fashion.

Kinetic Studies
in Droplets
Several other droplet systems
have previously been used to measure kinetics, but crucial differences
exist. Song et al.43 demonstrated how control
over the flow rates of the different fluid inlets in a flow-focusing
device can be used to measure fast enzyme kinetics. To obtain kinetic
data with sufficient quality, a dilution stream was imaged at nine
points along the channel with distance corresponding to the reaction
time. Historically, bar a few exceptions,44−46 most studies
in droplets have derived kinetic information from end-point detection,
because series of droplets created at high-throughput cannot easily
be kept in sequence. In these cases, following a specific droplet
over time becomes difficult (especially when large numbers of repeats
are required to improve data quality). For example, in experiments
employing the DropLab,24,25 only one measurement of product
concentration was taken (instead of following reaction turnover as
a function of time), and this one-point measurement provided the input
for a plot that shows the “rate” decrease as a function
of inhibitor concentration. Measuring just one time point to derive
an initial rate is based on the assumption of linearity, which is
only correct when early phases of time-courses are captured. By contrast,
a concentration gradient that is interrogated during each back-and-forth
movement gives access to full time-course measurements for the same
droplet, improves data quality (by a suitable curve fit through multiple
data points, as in Figure 5B), and allows ready
identification of nonlinearity. The ability to measure absorbance
in our format further increases the versatility of this setup, because
the circle of assays is increased beyond fluorescence that has been
the sole readout in previous platforms.24,25

Outlook
Future challenges will focus on the integration
of this COD platform with analytical interfaces, to extend compound
delivery to multistep processes, and to address biological experiments
that cannot be performed in bulk. Interfacing with separation techniques
such as capillary electrophoresis47 or
analysis by mass spectroscopy48 will allow
a high number of experiments to be examined sequentially and with
minimum supervision. Cell culturing can also be performed on chip
and integrated with droplet formation.49−51 Sequential robotic delivery
of reagents is important, for example, in ELISA assays52 or other types of immunoassays and can be programmed
into the workflow of this COD platform. When concentration gradients
are set up for droplets containing single cells or clusters of a few
cells that can be supplied in defined concentrations via Poisson distribution,
quantitative time-dependent experiments will be carried out on small
populations.53 Such an approach would allow
the revalidation of data from microplate cell-based assays that are
only possible with potentially heterogeneous cell populations.54,55

Experimental Section
Droplet Generation and Merging
The
carousel was filled
with perfluorinated oil (60 mL, FC-40), mixed with perfluorooctanol
(PFO; 0.5%, v/v; Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were supplied from a carousel
that carried up to 15 samples sitting on a metal ring with 15 holes
holding PCR tubes (Molecular BioProducts, 0.2 mL) that had the bottom
2 mm sliced off. To generate droplets, PTFE tubing (Ultramicrobore,
0.2 mm ID, 0.4 mm OD, Cole Parmer) was guided by a stainless steel
hook to suck the samples from below (see Figure
S1). To allow digital positioning, the carousel was mounted
onto a stepper-motor allowing precise alignment of the tubing and
sample. Negative pressure was applied from a glass syringe (200 μL)
with a syringe pump operating in withdrawal mode at constant debit
(Chemyx, Fusion 200). Both solenoid and stepper motor were controlled
by a custom-written Labview program.
In a typical experiment, 20–30 droplets were injected over
a distance of 15 cm from the first to last droplet. The droplet volume
was adjusted by variation of the suction flow rate (originating from
the pump) and the dwell time of the tubing in the aqueous phase (see Figure S4). The Labview program also controlled
merging of droplet pairs and the back-and-forth flow direction changes
for the detection of absorbance over time.

Absorbance Measurements
The tubing was aligned with
respect to the fibers via a custom-made polymeric block made of black
acetal. An analog-to-digital board (National Instruments) was used
to read voltages from the photodetector. Typical absorbance readings
were taken with a reading rate of 200 Hz using a custom-written Labview
program. A low-pass filter (with a high frequency cutoff at 30 Hz)
was applied to all readings. Using a molar extinction coefficient
(ε405 nm) of 13 200 M–1 cm–1 for 4-nitrophenol in PBS, measured in a 1
cm path length quartz cuvette, the effective average path length through
the droplets was calculated as 151 μm. This value is consistent
with the tube diameter of 200 μm and confirms good alignment
of the tubing and fibers.
