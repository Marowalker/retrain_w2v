==== Body
In our paper entitled “Optimized Fragmentation Regime for Diazirine
Photo-Cross-Linked Peptides”, there are two separate textual errors, one in Figure 6B (and repeated in the TOC graphic) and one in the
Data Analysis section. 

Results: Decision tree representation
(Figure 6B and TOC graphic)

In Figure 6B and again in the TOC graphic, a visual decision tree was created from the m/z binning in Figure 4D (compare also Supporting Information Figure S2). Unfortunately, an algorithmic error introduced an offset of 200 m/z in the representation of the decision tree. The
decision tree is corrected here (Figure 6B).

Data Analysis

The used modification masses were partly not
correctly stated. Instead, the following modification masses are the correct ones: “SDA” cross-link, 82.0418 Da (C5H6O); “SDA-loop”, 82.0418 Da (C5H6O); “SDA-hydro”, 100.0524 Da (C5H8O2). The reaction scheme in Figure S9 shows the derivation of these
masses.

reactions of sulfo-SDA.

During
our database search, however, we used the correct masses for the cross-linker
reaction between two peptides (“SDA”, 82.0418 Da) as
well as for the “SDA-loop” (82.0418 Da). The “SDA-hyd”
modification mass was not used in the database search.

The original
text at the bottom page of 8240:

...variable modifications,
carbamidomethylation on cysteine; oxidation on methionine; cross-linker,
SDA (mass modification: 109.0396 Da).

In addition, variable
modifications by the hydrolyzed cross-linker (“SDA-hyd”,
mass modification: 82.0413 Da) and loop-links (“SDA-loop”,
mass modification: 83.0491 Da) were allowed.

The correct text
should be as follows:

...variable modifications, carbamidomethylation
on cysteine; oxidation on methionine; cross-linker, SDA (mass modification:
82.0418 Da) and loop-links (“SDA-loop”, mass modification:
82.0418 Da) were allowed.
