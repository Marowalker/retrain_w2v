We introduce a portable biochemical
analysis platform for rapid
field deployment of nucleic acid-based diagnostics using consumer-class
quadcopter drones. This approach exploits the ability to isothermally
perform the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a single heater,
enabling the system to be operated using standard 5 V USB sources
that power mobile devices (via battery, solar, or hand crank action).
Time-resolved fluorescence detection and quantification is achieved
using a smartphone camera and integrated image analysis app. Standard
sample preparation is enabled by leveraging the drone’s motors
as centrifuges via 3D printed snap-on attachments. These advancements
make it possible to build a complete DNA/RNA analysis system at a
cost of ∼$50 ($US). Our instrument is rugged and versatile,
enabling pinpoint deployment of sophisticated diagnostics to distributed
field sites. This capability is demonstrated by successful in-flight
replication of Staphylococcus aureus and λ-phage
DNA targets in under 20 min. The ability to perform rapid in-flight
assays with smartphone connectivity eliminates delays between sample
collection and analysis so that test results can be delivered in minutes,
suggesting new possibilities for drone-based systems to function in
broader and more sophisticated roles beyond cargo transport and imaging.

==== Body
The recent
Ebola outbreak has
exposed some of the key limitations facing current infectious disease
management strategies, particularly when applied in remote underdeveloped
areas. Existing approaches are highly resource intensive, relying
on dispatching specially trained personnel to isolated locations where
biological samples are collected and returned to dedicated laboratories
for analysis. These inefficient channels become overwhelmed when field
sites are not connected by a modern transportation infrastructure,
introducing a considerable time lag between sample collection, diagnosis,
and implementation of countermeasures. The resulting bandwidth of
information flow is often extremely narrow, delaying treatment of
infected individuals and making it challenging for medical authorities
to proactively formulate effective courses of action. A need therefore
exists for inexpensive and robust tools that can be broadly deployed
to accelerate diagnosis, enable pinpoint delivery of therapeutics,
and provide real-time data to better inform decision making.1−10

Nucleic acid-based approaches like the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) are considered diagnostic gold standards in terms of both sensitivity
and specificity, but PCR is largely ruled out for portable deployment
owing to an unfavorable combination of (i) excessive electrical power
requirements associated with repeated heating and cooling of reagents
during thermocycling and (ii) complexities involved with inexpensively
implementing fluorescence-based product detection. Here, we show how
convective thermocycling can be leveraged to overcome these limitations,
laying the foundation for a new generation of simple ruggedized PCR-based
diagnostic platforms (Figure 1). The same natural convection phenomena at play in ordinary
motion lamps (e.g., Lava Lamps) enable the PCR to be isothermally
executed using a single heater maintained at the reaction’s
denaturing temperature. This inherently simple design dramatically
reduces electrical power consumption and can be readily interfaced
with a fluorescence detection system that exploits the versatility
and connectivity of ordinary smartphones.11−13 These breakthroughs
make it possible to construct ultraportable, rapid, and quantitatively
accurate PCR-based nucleic acid analysis systems for ∼$50 ($US)
enabling conventional laboratory protocols to be followed with little
or no modification (Figure S1, Table S1).

Figure 1 Lab-on-a-drone. (A) Convective thermocycling enables the PCR to
be actuated isothermally using a single heater. (B) The instrument
can be assembled for ∼$50 ($US) using readily available components.
(C) Fluorescence detection of reaction products is achieved using
an ordinary smartphone camera. (D) The entire assembly is incredibly
lightweight, enabling deployment on consumer-class quadcopter drones.
(E) Ruggedization is demonstrated by performing in-flight PCR as a
drone payload. Successful in-flight replication of two different DNA
targets is achieved (lane M, FlashGel DNA marker; lane 1, 147 bp S. aureus target (16 min in-flight reaction time);
lane 2, 237 bp target from a λ-phage DNA template (18 min in-flight
reaction time)). Tamb ∼ 23 °C.

Since its inception a little over
a decade ago,14 convective thermocycling
has remained an intriguing avenue
to enable rapid PCR, but a crucial roadblock to practical implementation
of this approach has been the inherent interdependence between the
internal flow field and the reactor geometry (expressed in terms of
the height, h, and diameter, d,
of a cylindrically shaped configuration, Figure 1A). The spatial temperature gradient established
between the top (cool) and bottom (hot) surfaces of the reactor not
only actuates the denaturing, annealing, and extension steps necessary
to perform the PCR but also supplies the driving force to physically
transport reagents between these reaction zones. It has previously
been assumed that this interplay implies a need to custom design reactor
geometries to match the individual thermal requirements of each PCR
assay to be performed (e.g., multiplex analysis involving different
primers with different annealing temperatures), and that robustness
is constrained by a need to maintain a specific orientation with respect
to the gravitational driving force. We recently developed a 3D coupled
flow-reaction model that contradicts this view, revealing an unexpectedly
broad design space dominated by chaotic advection where reaction rates
are greatly accelerated and remain essentially unchanged over virtually
the entire range of realistic PCR conditions.15,16 Any reactor geometry selected within this regime is therefore universally
functional (i.e., analogous to standardized PCR tubes and plates),
making it possible to execute a 30 cycle PCR in 10–20 min regardless
of temperature set point and spatial orientation.

Experimental
Section
Convective Thermocycling
Cylindrical reactors were
constructed from 1 in. diameter polycarbonate rod stock (Amazon Supply)
by cutting them to lengths and machining holes to produce reactors
of desired height (10 mm) and diameter (2.5 mm) yielding an ∼20
μL reactor volume. Smartphone-enabled real time PCR experiments
were performed to replicate a 237 base pair target from a λ-phage
DNA template using a SYBR Green PCR master mix (Table S2). Sensitivity to initial copy number (Figure 2F), ambient temperature (Figure 3C), and inclination
angle of the convective reactor (Figure 3E) were established without fluorescence
detection by replicating a 237 base pair target from λ-phage
DNA template with KOD polymerase enzyme (Table S3). Analysis of Ebola (150 bp target from positive control
template, Table S4) and Staphylococcus
aureus (147 bp target from purified genomic DNA, Table S5) was performed using test kits supplied
with the respective samples. Convective PCR runs for Ebola and Staphylococcus aureus detection were performed using a preincubated
hot start reagent mixture.

(A) The PCR to Go analysis app enables smartphone-based
image acquisition,
processing, and data analysis. (B–D) Measured fluorescence
as a function of initial template copy number (237 bp target from
a λ-phage DNA template; images acquired by the smartphone camera
are shown at the top of each plot). The data in (B) also show that
comparable results are obtained when analysis is performed in-flight
as a drone payload. (E) Quantification is achieved by applying sigmoidal
fits to these data (mean ± sd of 3 replicates) and using reaction
times when fluorescence exceeds a threshold value of 20 units to construct
a standard curve (inset, CT = 9.4, 11.8,
and 13.3 min for [DNA]0 = 105, 104, and 103 copies/μL, respectively), whose slope
yields a doubling time of 35.8 s. (F) Convective thermocycling (25
min reaction time) achieves sensitivity in the 101 to 102 copy/μL range (lane M, FlashGel DNA marker, remaining
lanes correspond to initial DNA copy numbers indicated on the gel
image). (G) Smartphone-based fluorescence analysis yields quantification
comparable to a benchtop real time PCR instrument, with nearly identical
standard curves.

Prior to reagent loading,
convective reactors were rinsed with
a 10 mg/mL aqueous solution of bovine serum albumin (Cat. no. A2153;
Sigma-Aldrich) followed by Rain-X Anti-Fog (ITW Global Brands) and
dried to minimize sidewall adsorption and enhance surface wettability.
After loading reagents, reactors were placed on the preheated (95
°C) ceramic heater surface of the portable PCR device and secured
using adhesive tape (Scotch Magic Tape, 3M). The PCR to Go iPhone app was run in continuous mode and set to capture images
of the top reactor surface at 1 min intervals. After incubation for
a desired time, convective reactors were removed and the post PCR
products were pipetted out for subsequent analysis by agarose gel
electrophoresis using a Lonza FlashGel system (1 μL of FlashGel
loading dye (Cat. no. 50462) and 4 μL of DNA samples). Samples
were run at 280 V for 8 min with a FlashGel DNA marker (100 bp–4
kb, Cat. no. 50473; scale (bp): 100, 200, 300, 500, 800, 1250, 2000,
and 4000).

Computational Modeling and Reactor Design
Detailed
formulation of the computational fluid dynamics and the PCR kinetic
model have been described previously.15 Briefly, the finite volume solver of STAR-CCM+ (CD-adapco) was used
to simultaneously evaluate the continuity, 3D Navier-Stokes, and energy
conservation equations with the Boussinesq approximation. The resulting
convective flow field was coupled with a PCR kinetic model yielding
time-resolved evolution of the target DNA concentration. A doubling
time (time required for the concentration of target DNA molecules
to double) was then extracted as a metric for the global DNA replication
rate. For the single heater setup, a convective heat loss boundary
condition was imposed at the top reactor surface (Q = hc (Ttop – Tamb); hc is the convective heat transfer coefficient (1000 W/(m2 K)); Ttop is the top boundary
temperature; Tamb is the ambient temperature).
There was no appreciable change in the velocity and temperature fields
when the adiabatic side walls were replaced with conductive acrylic
walls. Fluid properties were cast as temperature dependent field functions.
Geometries for 3D simulation were created and meshed using Gambit
(ANSYS). Nonuniform hexahedral grids were generated, and grid independent
solution was verified.

Circuit Design
The isothermal heater,
blue excitation
LED, and LCD screen were operated via a Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller
(ATmega328 - assembled) (circuit diagram shown in Figure S3, parts list and cost analysis provided in Table S6). Two 10 Ω ceramic wire wound
resistors (Mouser Electronics) arranged in parallel functioned as
heaters by converting electric current to heat. The heaters were encapsulated
using poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) to provide insulation, allowing
a 95 °C set point to be reached in ∼5 min (Figure 3B). One of the digital pins
(D3) in the microcontroller was assigned to provide the heater’s
5 V input through a 100 μF capacitor. A temperature probe (tmp35)
sensed the temperature of the heater, and the signal was sent to one
of the analog pins in the microcontroller (A5). This analog reading
was converted into temperature which was continuously monitored to
operate the heaters isothermally at 95 °C by actuating the pulse
width modulation (PWM) pin of the ATMEGA microprocessor. The PWM pin
outputs 100% of its signal until the temperature of the heater reaches
the set point and reduces to 85% thereafter. If the temperature exceeds
97 °C, the PWM signal reduces to zero. In our testing, this simple
scheme was sufficient to maintain the heater at 95 ± 2 °C.
The 16 MHz ceramic resonator (Mouser Electronics) with two 22 pF capacitors
(Mouser Electronics) connected to the microcontroller generated a
clock signal to control timing in the circuit. A 5 mW blue LED was
connected to a low-dropout (LDO) regulator (TLV2217-33) with two capacitors
(10 and 47 μF; Mouser Electronics) and a 100 Ω resistor
(Mouser Electronics) to provide a constant 3.3 V via one of the digital
pins in the microcontroller (D4). A LCD (Nokia 5110) was connected
to 6 digital pins (D6, D9, D10, D11, D12, D13) in the microcontroller
and was used to display and monitor real-time relevant information
such as the heater temperature and blue LED status. The Arduino program
was written and compiled in Arduino 1.0.6 integrated development environment
(IDE) and was loaded into the microcontroller through an FTDI chip
(Sparkfun). The final circuit and all the components were soldered
on a printed circuit board which was housed in a plastic case designed
using FreeCAD and printed using a MakerGear M2 3D printer. The device
can be powered by any 5 V USB-compatible electrical source. Testing
in Figure 3A,B was
performed using the following power sources: (1) a standard USB wall
outlet, (2) a USB battery pack (Vinsic Tulip, 5 V, 1 A), (3) a hand
crank generator (SOScharger; hand crank power was manually applied
during the entire heating and reaction time), and (4) a solar-rechargeable
USB battery pack (Solar Juice; solar power was used to charge the
battery pack prior to testing). The convective thermocycler assembly
weighs less than 300 g (Table S1).

and rugged PCR analysis platform. (A) Convective thermocycling
enables replication of a 150 bp Ebola target (lane 1) and a 147 bp S. aureus target (lanes 2, 3) in 20 min (lane M, FlashGel
DNA marker) using USB battery and hand crank power sources. (B) Comparable
heater performance is achieved via on- or off-grid electrical power
sources. Experiments (C) and reaction model simulations (D) display
consistent performance over a broad ambient temperature range. Experiments
(E) and simulations (F) show that product yields are insensitive to
the reactor’s orientation with respect to the vertical direction
up to tilt angles of at least 60°. (G) Simulations verify that
favorable flow fields are maintained at these orientations (V and T denote velocity magnitude and temperature
profiles). Gels in (C) and (E) show replication of a 237 bp target
from a λ-phage DNA template in 25 min (lane M, FlashGel DNA
marker; some smearing in the product bands is evident because a hot
start enzyme protocol was not employed in these tests). Plots in (D)
and (F) show doubling time (above) and fractional reactor volume maintained
at each PCR temperature condition (below).

In-Flight PCR as a Quadcopter Drone Payload
In-flight
PCR was performed using a 3D Robotics IRIS+ quadcopter drone ($799
retail price in fall 2014, available for under $500 as of December
2015). The IRIS+ is a consumer-class drone that provides ∼25
min of flight time over programmed paths with an operation radius
of 5–10 miles. We routinely obtained flight times of 15–18
min with the convective thermocycler and smartphone payload. The thermocycling
instrument was preheated for 3 to 5 min prior to mounting the PCR
reactor onto the heater base using adhesive tape (Scotch Magic Tape,
3M). The assembled instrument was fastened to the drone using an elastic
Velcro strap. A 3200 mA h portable external battery charger (Vinsic
Tulip, 5 V, 1 A) was used to power the convective PCR device, while
the drone was powered by its internal high capacity rechargeable battery.
After landing, the postflight PCR products were collected for further
analysis. We also obtained successful results using a DJI Phantom
2 quadcopter drone, but with reduced flight times of 10–12
min owing to its lower payload capacity.

Drone-Based Centrifuge
Drone-based centrifugation experiments
were performed by removing the quadcopter propellers and replacing
them with 3D printed centrifuge rotors designed to fit the motor shaft
threading. A low filament infill percentage was selected when optimizing
3D prints of these parts to ensure that the rotors remained lightweight
(comparable to the propeller blade mass) and maintained a circularly
symmetric mass distribution to help reduce additional wear on the
drone motors during centrifugation. The throttle/yaw stick on the
drone controller (left control stick on the IRIS+ quadcopter) was
gradually moved from the fully down position to the fully up position
to change the drone motors’ rotational speed. An optical tachometer
(Model 4059 Traceable Touchless/Contact Digital Tachometer, Traceable
Products) was used to measure rotational speeds attained by the centrifuge
attachment at each throttle setting. Rotational speeds (rpm) were
converted to relative centrifugal force (RCF) units via RCF (× g) = 1.12·R·(rpm/1000)2, where R was taken as the radius from the motor
shaft to the tip of a spin column tube (40 mm). The drone motors were
then activated to carry out centrifugation involving spin column-based
nucleic acid extraction/purification and separation/enrichment of
nanosized colloidal suspensions. 350 nm fluorescent magnetic particles
(Cat. no. FCM-02556-2, Spherotech, Inc.) and 40 nm colloidal gold
particles (Cat. no. 15707-20, Ted Pella, Inc.) were centrifuged for
5 and 10 min, respectively, using the drone at a throttle setting
of 10 000 rpm (4500g). The drone centrifuge
was operated in a shrouded enclosure, and appropriate personal safety
protection measures were taken to prevent injury while the rotors
were armed.

Nucleic acid extraction was demonstrated using the
positive control DENV-1-4 of the CDC DENV-1-4 real-time PCR assay
for detection and serotype identification of Dengue virus (Cat. no.
KK0128, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)). This
positive control contains heat-inactivated Dengue virus serotype DENV-1
Haw, DENV-2 NGC, DENV-3 H87, and DENV-4 H241 in human serum. Total
nucleic acid extraction was performed using a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit
(Cat. no. 51304, QIAGEN) using 200 μL of DENV-1-4 positive spiked
serum in each extraction. The nucleic acid was eluted with 200 μL
of Qiagen Buffer AE to keep the concentration factor of 1, following
the centrifugation protocol in Table S7. Spin times were increased in the drone-based protocol to compensate
for the lower RCF values than prescribed in the standard protocol.

To test the quality and efficiency of nucleic acid extraction performed
with the drone and with the benchtop centrifuge, reverse transcription
PCR was performed using primers and TaqMan-based hydrolysis probe
provided in the CDC DENV-1-4 real-time PCR assay kit. The PCR reaction
mixture was based on the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR
kit (Cat. no. 11732-020, Life Technologies), with forward and reverse
primers (D3-F and D3-R) and probe (D3-Texas Red TaqMan probe). A 5
μL aliquot of the purified RNA sample was used as template for
the RT-PCR (25 μL reaction volume). The reactions were performed
in a benchtop qPCR machine (CFX96 Real-Time System, Bio-Rad). The
temperature cycling protocol involved cDNA synthesis at 50 °C
for 30 min, denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min followed by 45 cycles
of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, and annealing/extension at
60 °C for 1 min.

iPhone-Based Fluorescence Analysis
The PCR
to Go application was written and developed in Xcode 5.0
using objective C. The core graphics and AVFoundation frameworks were
incorporated from Apple’s iOS software development kit (SDK)
to access and control advanced iPhone camera features such as exposure
time and focal length. This enabled images to be accessed via either
the user’s photo library or directly from the camera. A clip-on
magnifying lens (mini currency detector microscope, www.amazon.com) provided
a 10× optical zoom to the camera, and the PCR to Go app interface applied an additional 6× digital zoom via the
SDK’s core graphics affine transformation framework, allowing
the user to access a maximum of 60× zoom without degradation
of image quality. The focus and exposure are locked before each image
acquisition session ensuring constant lighting.

The app interface
enables a sequence of images to be automatically captured at regular
time intervals. User touch gestures are incorporated to select a desired
region of interest for image analysis. The selected analysis area
is converted into bitmap image format stored as a mutable data set
containing 4 bits per pixel (one for each red, blue, green and alpha
pixel values) corresponding to RGBA color space. The average, maximum,
and minimum RGBA pixel values for each image are calculated and can
be either tabulated on the screen or exported via email for further
manipulation. The average green pixel values were used for all fluorescence
intensity analysis.

A gamma correction was applied to the intensity
values via Icorrected = (Ioriginal/255)γ, where Ioriginal is the pixel intensity acquired from the smartphone
camera, and
a value of γ = 2.2 was used.17 Background
fluorescence was removed by subtracting the average intensity values
over the analysis area in the first image of the sequence (i.e., the
pre-PCR sample) from all subsequent images, yielding a common baseline.
Quantification was performed by applying a sigmoidal fit to the fluorescence
intensity versus time data18,19 as follows 1  where Imax and Io represent the maximum
and background fluorescence
intensities, respectively. The quantities t1/2 and k express the time required for intensity to
reach half of the maximum value and slope of the curve, respectively,
and were used as fitting parameters. Critical threshold reaction times
(Figure 2E, inset)
were determined from the point where the sigmoidal fit exceeded a
threshold value of 20 fluorescence units.

Results and Discussion
In-Flight
PCR
We leveraged this approach by first selecting
a cylindrically shaped reactor geometry whose internal flow field
is dominated by chaotic advection and then tuning its height h such that passive heat loss to the surrounding environment
automatically imposes the desired annealing conditions at the top
surface when the bottom is held at the denaturing temperature (Figure 1A). In this way,
the PCR is actuated isothermally by maintaining a single heater at
a constant temperature, drastically reducing electrical consumption
to a level that can be supplied by standard 5 V USB sources that power
ordinary consumer mobile devices. Instrument design is also greatly
simplified, with thermal management achievable by exploiting Joule
heating from off-the-shelf ceramic resistors regulated by a straightforward
feedback loop programmed using an Arduino-based microcontroller (Figure 1B). A 3D printed
enclosure and interchangeable smartphone cradle ensures alignment
of the camera and optical components independent of the specific mobile
device (Figure 1C).
The instrument is incredibly lightweight (<300 g, not including
the smartphone, Table S1), making pinpoint
deployment into remote field locations feasible using ordinary consumer-class
quadcopter drones (Figure 1D). Unprecedented ruggedness (i.e., ability to perform outside
of an idealized lab environment) is achievable, as evident by the
ability to perform PCR across different target/template systems during
flight as a drone payload. This capability is demonstrated by successful
in-flight replication of a 147 bp Staphylococcus aureus and 237 bp λ-phage DNA targets in under 20 min (Figure 1E, Movie S1).

Smartphone-Based Fluorescence Detection and
Quantification
We next explored the ability to perform quantitatively
accurate
in-flight product analysis. This capability, combined with smartphone
connectivity, challenges the existing view of drones (i.e., primarily
focused on operations involving cargo transport and imaging20,21) by introducing the potential to function as versatile mobile analytical
platforms (Figure S1). However, fluorescence-based
approaches are challenging to implement in a portable format due to
limitations on size, cost, and ruggedness. We addressed this by drawing
on previous advancements in exploiting the CMOS-based imaging sensor
embedded in ordinary smartphone cameras to record fluorescence generated
by a conventional SYBR Green reagent chemistry.22 The reactor is illuminated from the side by a low-power
blue LED, while the smartphone camera is used to view the top surface
of the reactor from above with the aid of an inexpensive mini-microscope
and band-pass emission filter (Figure 1A, Experimental Section). Images
are acquired using a dedicated smartphone app that allows the user
to adjust camera exposure, focus, and the time interval between successive
snapshots (Figure 2A).23 The collected images are gamma corrected
and split into 8-bit RGBA channels, after which the green channel
intensity is analyzed within a user-defined region of interest. Analysis
can be performed either in an end-point mode to obtain yes/no results
or in a time-resolved manner enabling reaction progress to be continuously
monitored.

Sensitivity and quantification were evaluated by
replicating a 237 bp target sequence from a λ-phage DNA template
over a series of initial copy numbers (Figure 2B–D). Comparable results are obtained
regardless of whether fluorescence analysis is performed in the lab
or in-flight as a drone payload (Figure 2B). A standard two parameter sigmoidal fit
was applied to the intensity data extracted from each sequence of
images, enabling the reaction time when fluorescence exceeds a threshold
level to be obtained (Figure 2E). This time scale is analogous to the critical cycle number
in conventional real-time PCR. These data can be used to construct
a standard curve whose slope yields an effective doubling time of
35.8 s (Figure 2E,
inset), in good agreement with the value of 35.2 s predicted by computational
simulations. Increased variability in the fluorescence data is observed
at the 19 and 20 min time points under the highest initial DNA starting
concentration, partially obscuring transition to the plateau phase
of replication. This variability is a consequence of the smartphone-based
imaging approach, where saturation of the fluorescence signal is approached
at high starting concentrations. The convective thermocycling approach
is not subject to inherent sensitivity limitations beyond those encountered
in conventional instruments and can be interfaced with more sophisticated
detection approaches to extend quantification down to the 10–100
copies/μL range (Figure 2F). As a comparison, we evaluated the same series of reactions
in a benchtop real-time PCR instrument (LightCycler 96, Roche) and
converted the convective data in Figure 2E (expressed in units of reaction time) to
equivalent cycle numbers by assuming that one conventional replication
cycle occurs during the 35.8 s doubling time. Both approaches agree
remarkably well, yielding virtually identical standard curves (Figure 2G).

Our adaptation
of smartphone-based fluorescence detection enables
quantitative analysis at template concentrations down to 1000 copies/μL,
a level sufficient for many diagnostic scenarios (i.e., depending
on the severity of an infection) and particularly impressive considering
the simplified instrument format. It is also envisioned that in practice
each PCR reactor will include a calibration target on the surface
and multiple reactor cells to enable parallel control reactions to
ensure consistent results. In the context of Ebola, viral loads on
the order of 105 to 106 RNA copies/mL characterize
many acute nonfatal infection scenarios.24 In developing countries lacking an extensive healthcare infrastructure,
patients often display acute symptoms by the time they are able to
visit a clinic, suggesting that the technology proposed here can potentially
help to bridge the gap between current-generation rapid diagnostic
tests and the PCR gold standard typically not feasible for broad implementation.25 Other diagnostic scenarios can potentially benefit
from this level of performance, including viral load monitoring of
HIV infection (generally involving quantification in the range of
103–107 copies/mL). There is interest
in expanding availability of viral load testing given its importance
for diagnostics, monitoring of treatment efficacy, and assessment
of/adherence to treatments. We also note that these detection limits
are dictated solely by our choice of LED illumination and smartphone
camera-based fluorescence detection and, therefore, can be improved
if it makes sense to do so within the context of a specific diagnostic
scenario or application need.

Design for Portability
Versatility and ruggedization
are also essential considerations in the context of portable field
operation. The conventional USB interface makes it possible to employ
a variety of power supplies suitable for use in remote settings, including
battery pack, hand crank, and solar chargers. Consistent reaction
yield (Figure 3A) and
heater performance (Figure 3B) are achievable regardless of electrical power source. We
also evaluated the effect of ambient environmental temperature and
the reactor’s orientation with respect to the vertical direction.
Ambient temperature conditions impact thermocycling performance by
virtue of their influence on the thermal gradient established within
the reactor. Experiments and computational simulations both reveal
that our system operates consistently across ambient temperatures
ranging from 5 to 35 °C (Figure 3C,D; “volume fraction” refers to the
percentage of the reactor volume at annealing, extension, and denaturing
temperatures, respectively). Reactions proceed most efficiently at
5 °C, with performance dropping above 35 °C where it becomes
difficult to maintain the spatially distinct temperature zones required
to actuate each stage of the reaction. Ambient temperature conditions
can also affect fluorescence detection via the dependence of LED emission
intensity, which decreases with increasing junction temperature, but
these effects are of small magnitude over the range of interest here
(<3% of the room temperature luminosity for junction temperatures
not exceeding 30 °C according to the LED manufacturer’s
datasheet) and can be straightforwardly addressed by incorporating
a circuit design that increases the drive current with increasing
temperature. Regarding the potential impact of temperature change
with altitude, we maintained altitudes of 50–100 ft during
the flight tests employed here, where a general rule of thumb is to
expect a 3.5–5 °F temperature decrease per 1000 ft increase
in elevation (depending on environmental factors such as relative
humidity). Therefore, we do not anticipate significant temperature
changes to occur within the envisioned operational envelopes.

The reactor’s orientation with respect to the vertical direction
would also intuitively be viewed as an important consideration given
the gravitational origin of the driving force for convective transport.
However, coordinated experiments and simulations both confirm that
this is not the case, revealing no appreciable change in reaction
performance as the reactor’s tilt angle is increased up to
at least 60° (Figure 3E–G). This invariance with spatial orientation is a
reflection of the chaotic advection regime’s inherent robustness,
where consistent flow phenomena are predicted over orders of magnitude
in the thermal driving force.15 Computational
simulations indicate that favorable flow fields can be maintained
at tilt angles approaching ∼80°, beyond which the onset
of secondary circulatory features becomes evident (Figure S2).

Drone-Based Centrifuge
Sample preparation
remains a
critical bottleneck in most portable diagnostic workflows, in large
part because benchtop centrifugation processes are challenging to
miniaturize. The quadcopter platform uniquely addresses this need
because its on-board rotors inherently deliver sufficient power to
function as laboratory centrifuges. We explored this possibility by
3D printing centrifuge rotors compatible with standard spin column-based
extraction/purification kits (Figure 4A). These attachments mount directly onto the motor
shaft and leverage the same self-tightening threading built into standard
rotor blades (diagonally opposed rotors spin in the same direction
for balanced operation). The quadcopter’s throttle control
enables rotational speeds up to 10 000 rpm to be accessed,
generating centrifugal forces comparable to benchtop instruments (Figure 4B). The resulting
platform is incredibly versatile, maintaining compatibility with commercial
spin column preparation kits (Figure 4C) and is robust enough to enable separation and enrichment
of nanosized colloidal materials from suspension (Figure 4D,E) with performance comparable
to conventional benchtop systems (Movie S2). Practical utility of the drone-based centrifuge platform is further
underscored by leveraging it to perform kit-based extraction of Dengue
viral RNA in human serum, yielding results on par with those obtained
from samples processed using a benchtop centrifuge (Figure 4F). This flexibility enables
virtually any standard sample preparation protocol to be deployed
with minimal modification to established laboratory practices. Notably,
drone run times between battery charges increase by over 50% when
the unit is used as a centrifuge (as compared with flight operation)
and can be further extended by programming the controller to activate
only a single motor. The 10 000 rpm rotation speed also delivers
sufficient power to enable more complex lab-on-a-CD analysis operations
to be performed on a drone-based platform.26,27

with 3D printed rotor attachments to enable standard centrifuge-based
workflows. (B) These attachments transform the quadcopter into a centrifuge
capable of rotation speeds ω up to 10 000 rpm (below,
mean ± sd of three replicates, error bars smaller than the plotted
symbols), yielding performance comparable to benchtop instruments
(above). (C–E) Images depicting samples before (left) and after

suspension centrifuged for 10 min at 10 000 rpm. (F) Real-time
PCR plot of Dengue virus serotype 3 amplification using templates
extracted by drone-based and benchtop centrifuges. The quantity of
RNA extracted in both platforms is comparable, as evident by quantification
cycle (Cq) values of 31.8 and 31.6 obtained
using the drone-based platform (two replicates) whereas Cq = 32.5 was obtained when the protocol was performed
using a benchtop centrifuge.

Conclusions
A performance/portability/cost comparison
between our instrument
and current commercially available systems is presented as the Supplementary Note. Here, we briefly consider
notable options beginning with a recently reported novel approach
leveraging a solar focusing lens to establish spatially distinct temperature
zones needed to perform continuous flow PCR.28 Although heating occurs passively, electrical power is required
to circulate reagents through the microfluidic network using a syringe
pump, post-PCR detection is achieved off-chip using a benchtop microscope,
and effective operation is contingent upon availability of sufficient
ambient sunlight. The suitcase-sized POCKIT system (GeneReach) is
a commercial convective thermocycler but is of limited utility for
portable diagnostics due to lack of an integrated battery and limited
end point fluorescence detection. The Palm PCR instrument (Ahram Biosystems),
a competing convection-based device, offers battery power but lacks
integrated fluorescence detection. Others have demonstrated capillary-based
convective real time PCR with integrated CCD-based detection,29,30 but these instruments are not portable and require a desktop computer
for operation and data analysis. The integrated sample preparation
capability enabled by our drone-based centrifuge platform is also
a significant advancement. The rotor design in Figure 4 delivers a relative centrifugal force (RCF)
of ∼4500g at 10 000 rpm, surpassing
the capabilities of previously developed systems aimed at performing
blood plasma separations in resource-limited settings via mechanisms
based on hand operated egg beaters (RCF = 280g at
1200 rpm),31 bicycle wheels (RCF = 240g at 750 rpm),32 and salad spinners
(RCF = 31g at 602 rpm).33

Our system delivers a rugged inexpensive biochemical analysis
platform
ideally suited for field deployment (Figure S1). The ∼$50 ($US) hardware cost (not including the smartphone, Table S6) and compatibility with consumer-class
quadcopter drones (whose prices continue to rapidly decrease) breaks
existing price barriers by several orders of magnitude (Supplementary Note, Figure S4), while the simplified
imaging and device agnostic design makes it
possible to leverage a growing low-cost smartphone marketplace to
deliver affordable fluorescence detection. In addition to ongoing
initiatives aimed at producing affordable camera-equipped smartphones
for developing country markets, there is already a huge market for
second hand smartphones that may be obsolete in first-world markets
but remain well equipped for diagnostic applications in resource-limited
settings.22 Smartphone-based analysis also
introduces extraordinary connectivity, making it possible to tap into
existing communication networks for real-time delivery of analysis
results.34 Drones are inherently capable
of autonomous operation, enabling targeted establishment of pop-up
hubs for programmed payload exchange, battery charging, and routine
maintenance. The distribution of these nodes can dynamically evolve
so that cargo can be directed to specific locations based on real-time
data, enabling access to very remote settings. These capabilities
suggest new potential for drone-based systems to function in broader
and more sophisticated roles beyond cargo transport and imaging. Areas
for future improvement include development and packaging of assay
kits for reagent delivery in parallel with instrument deployment and
broader quantification of product yields and detection limits.

The United States clinical laboratory improvement amendments (CLIA)
classify clinical diagnostic tests as high, moderate, or waived complexity based upon
the nature of the test performed.35,36 PCR-based
diagnostics are currently classified as high complexity due to prerequisite
operational training and sophisticated instrumentation, thereby making
them expensive and impractical for mass distribution in portable applications.
The versatile platform introduced here offers potential to enable
PCR to be classified in the moderate or waived complexity categories,
opening the door for a new generation of fast, accurate, and affordable
diagnostic tools impacting a host of new scenarios where rapid field-deployable
analysis is needed but not yet widely available (e.g., emergency response,
agricultural biosurveillance, and veterinary field care scenarios).
