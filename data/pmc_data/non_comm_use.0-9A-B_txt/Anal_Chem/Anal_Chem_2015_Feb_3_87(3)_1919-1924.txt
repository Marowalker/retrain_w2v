Tissue immunostaining is critically
important in clinical applications, and antibodies have been used
extensively as the molecular probes. Recently, aptamer, as a new class
of probes, have attracted much attention for their potential clinical
and research value. Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a
specific biomarker which is overexpressed in many cancers of epithelial
origin. Here, a DNA-based EpCAM aptamer SYL3C is reported as a probe
for the immunostaining of frozen and paraffin-embedded sections of
colorectal cancer tissues. Commercialized EpCAM antibodies were also
used as a standard control. EpCAM aptamer SYL3C specifically recognized
and immunostained cancer nests of colorectal tumor sections, but it
neither reacted with background cells within tumor sites nor exhibited
cross-reaction to the benign lesions or inflammation of colorectal
tissues. No cross-linking to EpCAM-negative malignant tumor sections
occurred. Compared with standard antibody staining, our EpCAM aptamer
SYL3C protocol is simpler to implement with a shorter reaction time.
Moreover, SYL3C can specifically bind with either frozen or paraffin-embedded
tissue sections. Since the histopathology of frozen tissue is closer
to that of fresh tissue and since frozen sections can be produced
more quickly than paraffin-embedded sections, SYL3C immunostaining
of frozen sections is a quick protocol that is easy to implement.

==== Body
Cancer histopathology
is currently the preferred method for detecting microscopic anatomical
changes in tissue sections, making the discovery of cancer biomarkers
critical for early diagnosis and treatment, and antibodies have been
used extensively as the molecular probes.1 Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a transmembrane glycoprotein
known to be highly expressed in epithelial carcinomas. It is also
an ideal biomarker for clinical applications in cancer diagnosis,
prognosis, imaging, and therapy.2−4 Thus, EpCAM plays an important
role in the diagnosis and treatment of various related malignant tumors.5 The most popular method for detection of EpCAM
is immunostaining of paraffin-embedded tissue sections by antibodies,6−8 which are currently the only clinically validated and commercially
available probes for this purpose. However, the production of antibodies
requires a series of complicated and time-consuming processes. As
such, the use of EpCAM antibodies in clinical application has been
limited.9

Aptamers are single-stranded
DNA, RNA, or modified nucleic acids selected through a process known
as Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX).10−13 Aptamers can specifically bind to their target molecules with high
affinity at pico- to nanomolar levels, very similar to antibodies.14−16 Compared with antibodies, aptamers can bind to a wider range of
targets,17,18 and they have the advantages of low molecular
weight, high stability, easy and reproducible synthesis, easy functionalization,
lack of immunogenicity, rapid tissue penetration, and low toxicity.19−22 On the basis of their high affinity and specific binding properties,
scientists are testing the use of aptamer probes for cancer cell detection23 and cancer chemotherapy.14,19,24 In 2011, Duan developed a RNA-based EpCAM
aptamer.9 Unfortunately, RNA is notoriously
prone to nuclease degradation, which limits its application in clinical
research without expensive modification. Later, Yang and his group
discovered DNA-based EpCAM aptamers, in particular SYL3C.25 Different from the RNA-based EpCAM aptamer,
SYL3C is less expensive and easier to use and store, affording high
potential for in vitro assays and in vivo applications.

Among in vivo applications,
either frozen or paraffin-embedded sections are commonly used for
histopathological examination. However, frozen tissue is closer to
that of fresh tissue, and frozen sections can be produced more quickly
than paraffin-embedded sections. Moreover, protein activity has maximum
retention in frozen tissue sections.

We herein report the
validation of EpCAM aptamer SYL3C as a probe for immunostaining the
overexpressed EpCAM in colorectal cancer sections, thus providing
a new, effective molecular tool for the diagnosis of cancers of epithelial
origin like colorectal cancer. On the basis of its convenience and
low cost, the aptamer probe is expected to replace EpCAM antibodies
for use in in vitro and in vivo experiments.

Materials
and Methods
Fluorescence-Labeled EpCAM Aptamer (SYL3C-CY3), DAPI
The oligonucleoide DNA aptamer probe labeled with Cy3 (SYL3C-Cy3,
48 bp) and with the following sequence was synthesized: 5′-CAC
TAC AGA GGT TGC GTC TGT CCC ACG TTG TCA TGG GGG GTT GGC CTG-(PEG)3-Cy3-3′ (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, CN). A random sequence
(5′-rN (n = 48)-3′) was also generated
to block nonspecific tissue staining. DAPI (Beyotime Institute of
Biotechnology, Shanghai, CN) was used to label the nucleus.

Antibodies
Antihuman-EpCAM mouse monoclonal antibody MOC-31 (catalog no. Ab134301)
recognizes the extracellular domain of EpCAM (EpEX), and the secondary
antibody was also labeled with Cy3 (catalog no. Ab97035). Rabbit monoclonal
antibody (catalog no. Ab32392) recognizes the intracellular oncogenic
domain of EpCAM (EpICD), and the secondary antibody was labeled with
Cy3 (catalog no. Ab97075). All antibodies were from Abcam, Cambridge,
MA.

Fresh Tissue Specimens
All fresh tissues were obtained
from Xiangya Hospital (Changsha, Hunan, CN) in compliance with a protocol
approved by the Institutional Review Board of Central South University
of Xiangya Hospital. These samples included colon cancer (n = 8), rectum cancer (n = 8), benign lesion
(n = 8), and another EpCAM-negative malignant tumors,
as indicated in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information.

Specimen collection was performed by surgeons, and each specimen
was separated into two parts. One part was cut for EpCAM aptamer staining
and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for frozen tissue sections; the
other part was cut for EpCAM aptamer, anti-EpEX, and anti-EpICD staining
for paraffin-embedded sections. The series of samples containing normal,
junction, and cancer tissue were collected from the same cancer patient.
All tissue specimens and slides were examined by an experienced pathologist.

Frozen Tissue Sections
The surgical specimens were immersed
in a gel-like medium consisting of polyethylene glycol and poly(vinyl
alcohol) (OCT gel). The specimen was positioned in the center of a
disk that was placed on the cryobar in the cryostat, secured in a
chuck, and frozen rapidly to about −20 to −30 °C.
Sufficient OCT was removed to make a full section of the specimen
visible. When in contact with the glass slide, the OCT and tissue
melted, causing the tissue to adhere to the slide.

Formalin-Fixed
and Paraffin-Embedded Tissue Sections
The tissues were fixed
in 10% formalin for 24 h at room temperature (RT). They were then
washed and embedded in paraffin blocks. After slicing, the sections
were mounted on slides, air-dried for 30 min, and baked overnight
at 45–50 °C.

Immunostaining of Frozen Tissue Sections
by SYL3C-Cy3
Different from paraffin-embedded tissue sections,
deparaffinization and antigen retrieval were not needed for frozen
tissue sections. To rule out nonspecific binding, frozen sections
were incubated in 1 μM random sequences for 5 min. Then, SYL3C-Cy3
was diluted in 250 nM binding buffer and incubated with the sections
for 20 min before incubation with DAPI for 3 min to clearly show the
position of the nucleus. Each frozen tissue section was washed with
40 mL washing buffer (DPBS with 25 mM MgCl2 and 0.045%d-glucose) three times for a total of 15 min on a shaker and
then observing under a fluorescence microscope. All steps were performed
at RT in the dark (Figure S1A in the Supporting
Information).

Immunostaining of Paraffin-Embedded Tissue
Sections by SYL3C-Cy3
For aptamer staining, tissue sections
were deparaffinized three times in xylene and washed with 100% ethanol,
followed by 95% ethanol and 75% ethanol. For antigen retrieval, tissue
sections were boiled in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) for 15 min, followed
by incubating in binding buffer (PBS with 20% fetal calf serum and
1 mM DNA sodium salt from calf thymus) at RT for 1 h.

After
two washes with binding buffer, sections were incubated with 1 μM
random sequence and then incubated with 250 nM SYL3C-Cy3 for 1 h.
The sections were washed three times with binding buffer, sealed,
and observed by fluorescence microscopy (Figure S1B in the Supporting Information).

Immunostaining of Paraffin-Embedded
Tissue Sections by EpCAM Antibodies
For antibody staining,
paraffin-embedded tissue sections were baked at 62 °C for 8–24
h, then deparaffinized twice in turpentine, washed with 100% ethanol,
followed by 95% ethanol and 75% ethanol. Finally, sections were washed
with running water with blocking by 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min.

For antigen retrieval, tissue sections were boiled in citrate buffer
solution (pH 6.0) for 3 min. Sections were then washed in phosphate
buffer solution (PBS) three times, followed by probing with anti-EpEX
and anti-EpICD (1:100 dilution) at 37 °C for 1 h, respectively.
After three washes with PBS, tissue sections were incubated with secondary
antibody for 30 min at 37 °C and then washed again three times
with PBS. Finally, sections were washed in distilled water before
examination using fluorescence microscopy (Figure S1C in the Supporting Information).

Results
Specific Immunostaining
of Colorectal Cancer Tissue Sections by EpCAM Aptamer Probe SYL3C-CY3
Normal, junction, and cancer tissues from the same patient were
made into a series of frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue sections.
Compared with the process of producing paraffin-embedded tissue sections,
the protocol for preparing frozen tissue sections is simpler and less
time-consuming. Using SYL3C-CY3 to incubate the frozen tissue sections
at RT, only 20 min is required before the results can be viewed by
fluorescence microscopy. For comparison, the paraffin-embedded tissue
sections were probed by SYL3C-CY3 and EpCAM antibodies (anti-EpEX
or anti-EpICD), respectively. Before incubation, the paraffin-embedded
tissue sections had to be deparaffinized and antigen retrieved for
24 h at 100 °C. Using SYL3C-CY3 as the probe, incubation time
was 1 h at RT before examining sections by fluorescence microscopy.
When using anti-EpEX or anti-EpICD, we first needed to incubate the
paraffin-embedded tissue sections at 37 °C to probe out the EpCAM,
followed by an additional incubation with CY3-labeled secondary antibody
for another 30 min at 37 °C before submitting to microscopy (Figure
S1 in the Supporting Information).

Cancer cases were stained with H&E for morphological confirmation
(Figure 1a). In both frozen (Figure 1b) and paraffin-embedded tissue sections (Figure 1c), SYL3C-CY3 could probe out the cancer nest with
high specificity, without any cross-linking with normal colon or rectal
tissue. Similarly, both anti-EpEX (Figure 1d) and anti-EpICD (Figure 1e) could immunostain
the cancer with high specificity, with only very weak staining in
normal tissues.

200× magnification.

Figure 2 showed pictures under light
microscopy with 400× magnification, using DAPI immunostaining
of the nucleus. Anti-EpICD binds only with the intracellular oncogenic
domain of EpCAM, while anti-EpEX binds only with the extracellular
domain. For using SYL3C-CY3, we could image the cancer tissue sections
in one step. When using EpCAM antibodies for imaging, anti-EpICD and
anti-EpEX were both needed to probe the intracellular oncogenic domain
and extracellular domain of EpCAM, respectively.

Specific Immunostaining
of Colorectal Cancer Series Frozen Tissue Sections by EpCAM Aptamer
Probe SYL3C-CY3
Normal, junction, and cancer tissues collected
from the same colon cancer patient were prepared as a series of frozen
tissue sections and immunostained by SYL3C-CY3. Normal colon showed
only a weak signal. As shown in Figure 3A,
the fluorescence signal from EpCAM aptamer successively increased
from junction tissue to cancer tissue. In junction tissue, SYL3C-CY3
was expressed in the membrane and cytoplasm but not in nucleus (see
row 2 of Figure 3A,B). However, in cancer tissue,
SYL3C-CY3 mainly expressed in the nucleus (see row 3 of Figure 3A).

Figure 3 Series of immunostained frozen tissue sections of colon
cancer probed by EpCAM aptamer SYL3C-CY3: (A) pictures obtained using
a light microscope with 200× magnification and (B) junction tissue
images obtained using a light microscope with 400× magnification.
Probing of the tissues with SYL3C-CY3 showed staining in the membrane
and cytoplasm but not in the nucleus (indicated by arrows).

Identical results were found for
the images taken from the series of rectal cancer frozen sections.
The fluorescence signal from EpCAM aptamer is very weak in normal
tissue (see column 2, row 1 in Figure 4). In
the junction tissue section, the right side is normal rectum and the
left side is rectal cancer. We can see a strong fluorescence signal
from the left cancer nest but, in striking contrast, a very weak signal
from the right normal rectal tissue (see column 2, row 2 of Figure 4). Also in the cancer place, the fluorescence signal
is very strong (see row 3 of Figure 4).

frozen tissue sections of rectal cancer probed by EpCAM aptamer SYL3C-CY3.

No Cross-Reaction of the
EpCAM Aptamer Probe to Non-EpCAM-Expressing Tissues
Using
the SYL3C-CY3 probe, no signal was reported from frozen tissue sections
exhibiting either colonitis or the presence of colon polyps. We also
collected some samples of non-EpCAM-expressing malignant tumors (hypophysoma,
meningioma, and renal clear cell carcinoma). No fluorescence signal
output was observed after incubation (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information).

Discussion
In 1979, EpCAM, as an antigen, was found in colorectal cancer for
the first time,26 and it was considered
to be a biomarker for colorectal cancer. Later, research confirmed
that EpCAM was widely expressed in most cancers of epithelial origin.
Expression level of EpCAM is an important factor in disease pathogenesis,27 from precancerous lesions to malignant tumor
to metastasis and cancer relapse.28 These
findings indicate that EpCAM is overexpressed in cancers of epithelial
origin, upregulated in progressive carcinogenesis, and associated
with tumor metastasis. Therefore, EpCAM can be used as a molecular
biomarker in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of many kinds
of cancer of epithelial origin.

EpCAM, also known as CD326,
is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is known to be highly expressed
in epithelial carcinomas. It has three main domains: EpEX, EpICD,
and the transmembrane domain. In the Wnt signaling pathway, EpEX and
EpICD can be transferred from the cell membrane to the nucleus and
this is closely related to the occurrence and development of the tumor.
Thus, EpEX and EpICD are the main antigenic sites, calling for the
necessity of two different antigens by antibodies for their detection.

Yang et al.25 selected DNA-based EpCAM
aptamers in 2013, with SYL3C as the most optimized. The present report
is the first example applying SYL3C to the fluorescence imaging of
pathological frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue sections of colorectal
cancer. SYL3C specifically recognized the colorectal cancer nest,
but it did not react with background cells within tumor sites. Furthermore,
it exhibited no cross-reaction to benign lesion or inflammatory lesion
and did not cross-link with EpCAM-negative cancer tissues. On the
basis of these properties, DNA-based EpCAM aptamer SYL3C can be used
as a probe for immunostaining of cancers of epithelial origin for
differential diagnosis. It is also a useful molecular tool for discriminating
between normal and cancerous tissue.

In this work, SYL3C was
shown to specifically bind to both frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue
sections but frozen sections are more similar to fresh tissue, and
the preparation of frozen sections is much less time-consuming than
that for paraffin-embedded sections, making the protocol of SYL3C
immunostaining of frozen sections preferable by its simplicity.

As the standard control, our research utilized the traditional methods
involving EpCAM antibodies and immunohistochemistry. Although the
imaging effect was almost the same between aptamer and antibodies,
including anti-EpEX and anti-EpICD, EpCAM aptamer SYL3C can execute
the imaging of colorectal tissue sections in one simple step, while
for both anti-EpEX and anti-EpICD, it is necessary to detect EpEX
and EpICD separately, followed by an additional incubation with secondary
antibody for fluorescence detection. Since preparation and storage
of EpCAM aptamer are straightforward and cost-effective, SYL3C is
expected to replace antibody-based immunostaining for the diagnosis
of colorectal cancer.

EpCAM is not expressed in cancers of nonepithelial
origin. Therefore, in the course of the experiment, we found no signal
output for such tissue sections after incubation, indicating the ability
of EpCAM aptamer to discriminate between cancers of epithelial origin
and others.

Up until now, research has focused on monoclonal
antibody therapy and corresponding targeted antibody development.
In 2009, Catumaxomab, a rat-mouse hybrid monoclonal antibody, was
approved for patients with EpCAM-positive tumors and malignant ascites.29 Many antibodies are now commonly used for the
diagnosis and treatment of EpCAM-based cancers. However, the use of
antibodies has been limited in clinical trials because of their instability
and high costs. In the present study, we have shown that EpCAM aptamer
SYL3C specifically recognized EpCAM in colorectal cancer tissue, thus
providing a theoretical basis for this probe as a future target treatment
for colorectal cancer.

In conclusion, we have developed a new
immunofluorescence method for staining the frozen tissue sections
of colorectal cancer by an EpCAM DNA-based aptamer. Thus, we have
also provided a new, effective molecular tool for the diagnosis of
EpCAM-positive colorectal cancer, and we anticipate that synthetic
DNA-based aptamer probes will become powerful tools for pathologists
in addition to currently used antibodies.
