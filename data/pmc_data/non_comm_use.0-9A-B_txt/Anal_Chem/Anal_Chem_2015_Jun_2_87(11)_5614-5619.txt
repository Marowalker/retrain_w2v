Laser-induced acoustic desorption
(LIAD) has recently been established
as a tool for analytical chemistry. It is capable of launching intact,
neutral, or low charged molecules into a high vacuum environment.
This makes it ideally suited to mass spectrometry. LIAD can be used
with fragile biomolecules and very massive compounds alike. Here,
we apply LIAD time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) to the natural
biochromophores chlorophyll, hemin, bilirubin, and biliverdin and
to high mass fluoroalkyl-functionalized porphyrins. We characterize
the variation in the molecular fragmentation patterns as a function
of the desorption and the VUV postionization laser intensity. We find
that LIAD can produce molecular beams an order of magnitude slower
than matrix-assisted laser desorption (MALD), although this depends
on the substrate material. Using titanium foils we observe a most
probable velocity of 20 m/s for functionalized molecules with a mass m = 10 000 Da.

==== Body
Many analytical
chemistry studies
have focused on how to launch and control charged molecules, for instance
using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)1 or electrospray ionization (ESI).2 However, it is of analytical relevance to revisit methods
that are capable of transferring neutral or lowly charged molecules
into the gas phase, free from any carrier gas or matrix. LIAD3 is a method that avoids these contaminants and
allows analytes to be launched into a high vacuum environment, for
example, close to the ionization region of a TOF-MS. It minimizes
transfer losses between the source and the mass analyzer with the
potential to detect rare samples very efficiently. In contrast to
MALDI and ESI, LIAD separates the launch and the ionization mechanism.
This enables particle specific detection through multiphoton ionization.

In a typical LIAD experiment the analyte molecules are placed on
the front side of a metal foil that is several micrometers thick.
A short, intense laser pulse incident on the back side ablates some
foil material. Shock waves induced by thermo-mechanical stress in
the foil4,5 eject analyte molecules and substrate material
from the front side.

LIAD was originally used to launch electrons
and ions3 and soon after it was extended
to large polypeptides6 and even DNA strands.7 It has also been used to load neutral or lowly
charged medium-sized
molecules into mass spectrometers8 and
even to launch silicon nanoparticles9 or
biological cells10 up to a mass of 1010 Da.

Here, we extend the application of LIAD to biochromophores,
study
the softness of this technique, and the effect of molecular functionalization
on the desorption process. In addition, we investigate the velocity
of the desorbed molecules and find that even for these very large
particles the velocity is significantly lower than in MALDI. This
will be beneficial for analytical chemistry, physical chemistry, spectroscopy,
ionization studies,11,12 classical beam deflectometry,13−15 molecular cooling,16 and matter-wave
experiments.17,18

Experimental Section
Molecules
Hemin, bilirubin, biliverdin, and zinc tetraphenylporphyrine
(ZnTPP) were obtained commercially from Sigma-Aldrich. The chlorophyll
a was extracted and purified from spinach in ethanol following an
established procedure.19 ZnTPP was dissolved
in acetone, while all other molecules were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(99.9%) with a concentration of 10 mg/mL. An array of small droplets
(∼2 μL) of this solution was deposited onto a clean,
thin titanium foil with a thickness of 10 ± 2 μm and a
purity of 99%. The sample was then transferred into the vacuum chamber.

To explore how perfluoroalkyl-functionalization can facilitate
the desorption process, we synthesized two sets of molecules (see
the Supporting Information). The diporphyrin 1Lx, shown in Figure 1a, is a molecular library that covers a mass range of 3 630–5 470
Da in steps of 460 Da. It can be synthesized from two porphyrin building
blocks in a single step using a Glaser-Hay coupling.20,21 All substituents of the phenyl rings in the porphyrin meso positions
are either fluorine atoms or perfluoroalkylsulfanyl groups. Figure 1b shows our second molecular library 2Lx which covers masses beyond 10 000 Da.22,23

Figure 1 Perfluoroalkylated
porphyrins for desorption studies with LIAD.
In panel a the diporphyrin library 1Lx is displayed. Each of the fluorine atoms on the outer phenyl rings
can be substituted with a perfluoroalkyl chain. In panel b the structure
of the porphyrin library 2Lx is sketched.
To achieve higher molecular masses, a number x of
branched alkyl side chains have been used.

The perfluoroalkylated molecules were prepared in diethyl
ether
and dried on a pure tantalum foil as this was found to increase the
number of detected particles. The addition of 2 mg/mL of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic
acid (DHB) to the solution of 2Lx also
increased the signal. In contrast to MALDI, where DHB fosters molecular
ionization, we detect no ions originating from the LIAD process without
the postionization stage.

Experimental Setup
Figure 2 shows
a drawing of the experimental setup. A motorized manipulation stage
positioned the foil targets at a distance D = 23
± 1 mm to the detection laser beam when using the natural chromophores
and at D = 43 ± 2 mm otherwise. The light of
a frequency tripled Nd:YAG laser was focused to a waist of 1 mm diameter
on the back side of the metal foil. In order to expose a fresh sample
spot to every desorption laser pulse, the stage was translated laterally.
The neutral molecules fly into the extraction region of the TOF-MS
where they intersect a 157.6 nm fluorine-laser beam which ionizes
them.

Figure 2 Molecules are volatilized by laser-induced acoustic desorption
from the front surface of a thin metal foil by irradiating its backside
with intense pulsed laser light with λdes = 355 nm,
τdes = 4 ns, Φdes = 10–510
MW/cm2. The emerging plume is postionized using vacuum
ultraviolet light, with λion = 157.6 nm, τion = 8 ns, Φion = 0.16–2.2 MW/cm2, and characterized using TOF-MS.

Mass Spectra
Figure 3 shows
typical LIAD mass spectra of all four biochromophores at comparable
photoionization laser intensities. Each spectrum is an average over
30 shots.

Figure 3 LIAD mass spectra after VUV ionization of (a) hemin, (b) chlorophyll,
(c) bilirubin, and (d) biliverdin. Chlorophyll a, bilirubin, and biliverdin
were desorbed with Φdes = 54 MW/cm2, hemin
with Φdes = 89 MW/cm2. The ionization
intensity for all molecules was Φion = 1.1(1) MW/cm2.

Figure 3a shows the hemin mass spectrum
[Fe Por-Cl]+ at m = 652 Da as well as
[Fe Por]+ and further peaks attributed to the loss of CH2COOH-groups. Chlorophyll is a derivative of hemin, and its
core survives the LIAD process undamaged. We observe a peak at 871
Da, corresponding to pheophytin a, i.e., the intact parent molecule
without the central magnesium atom. However, we also find a fragment
signal at 536 Da which is attributed to pyropheophorbide a. LIAD is
also capable of generating beams of intact neutral bilirubin (Figure 3c) and biliverdin (Figure 3d). Bilirubin exhibits additional fragments at 286 and 300 Da which
indicate cleavage of the molecule into two sections. Biliverdin is
the most stable chromophore in our series. Given the same desorption
and postionization intensities as used for chlorophyll a, it remains
intact during desorption and postionization.

Intensity Dependence
We record the abundance of the
intact hemin as a function of the desorption laser intensity I. We see that it can be described by S = S0 · In with n = 1.36 ± 0.13. Similar
to other experiments,4,24 we do not observe any saturation
of the desorbed molecular flux in this intensity range.

Fragmentation
Molecular fragmentation may occur chemically
during the sample preparation, thermally during desorption4 or through light-induced processes during postionization.
Earlier postionization studies observed substantial fragmentation
of hemin, even when the molecule was desorbed into a buffer gas.25

In Figure 4 we
show that LIAD is intrinsically soft and that all hemin fragments
observed in Figure 3 are due to VUV ionization.
In Figure 4a we plot the fragment-to-parent
ratio as a function of the desorption laser intensity. The fragment
ratio remains constant, within 20%, even when we vary the desorption
intensity by more than a factor of 60, confirming the softness of
the LIAD process. As a function of the detection laser intensity,
however, this ratio grows by a factor of 5 and saturates (Figure 4b). This is demonstrated by the hemin spectra at
low and high ionization laser intensity in Figure 4c,d.

Figure 4 Comparison of LIAD-VUV-TOF-MS for hemin at (a) Φion = 0.7(1) MW/cm2 and (b) Φion = 2.0(2)
MW/cm2 reveals that ionization at VUV high intensities
leads to fragmentation, while the LIAD process itself is soft.

The situation is different for
chlorophyll a, where molecules can
lose their side chain even at the lowest ionization intensity required
to get a sufficient signal. This indicates that fragmentation most
likely occurs during the desorption process.

In an independent
experiment we have tested the ionization of hemin
at 266 nm and find that this two-photon process leads to substantial
fragmentation. This shows that 157.6 nm light provides more efficient
ionization than 266 nm, making it better suited to mass spectrometry
of biochromophores.

Velocity Distribution
Many applications
in physical
chemistry require slow particle beams. We therefore characterize the
molecular beam velocity after LIAD by counting the number of molecules
as a function of the delay between the desorption and the photoionization
laser pulses. The resulting distribution is shown in Figure 5. For hemin launched from titanium, we find a most
probable velocity of (49 ± 5) m/s and still substantial signal
as low as 25 m/s. The error bar in the velocity includes the estimated
uncertainty in the desorption time of up to several tens of microseconds.4,11

Figure 5 Velocity
distribution of neutral hemin released by LIAD from a
titanium foil with Φdes = 15 MW/cm2 and
Φion =1.3(1) MW/cm2. Each data point is
an average over 30 shots for each of five individual samples. The
red line is a guide to the eye. The vertical error bars represent
the standard error caused by sample inhomogeneities.

Mass Spectra
A
typical mass spectrum of 1Lx is shown
in Figure 6a.
The most abundant molecule contains six perfluoroalkyl side chains
and has a mass of approximately 4 550 Da. The peaks are separated
by Δm = mchain – mF = 460 Da. Finding mF in the mass difference corroborates the hypothesis that the observed
mass distribution is due to the chemical synthesis. In the case of
LIAD-induced fragmentation, the broken bond would not be refluorinated.
The same holds true for 2Lx (Figure 6b). Here the peak distance of 763 Da also corresponds
to the mass difference between a side chain (SH15C20F26) and a fluorine atom.

Figure 6 LIAD mass spectrum of
the perfluoroalkyl-functionalized porphyrin
libraries (a) 1Lx and (b) 2Lx. The observed peak separation supports the assumption
of fragment-free desorption.26

Mass Dependent Velocities
Earlier
experiments23 showed that thermal beams
of 2Lx at T = 500 K
had a most probable
velocity around 80 m/s. In comparison, Figure 7 shows the mass-dependence of the molecular velocities after LIAD
for several porphyrin derivatives, from ZnTPP (m =
678 Da) to functionalized molecules beyond m = 10 000
Da. All were launched from an 8 μm thick tantalum foil.

Figure 7 Mass-dependence
of the molecular beam velocity after LIAD from
tantalum. A linear fit to the double-logarithmic graph yields the
power law v ∝ m–0.42±0.06.

A linear fit to the double-logarithmic
plot indicates a power law
for the mass dependence of the most probably velocity v ∝ m–0.42±0.06. Similar
experiments were carried out to determine the initial velocity of
ions in MALDI.27 The authors found a similar
power law v ∝ m–0.32±0.2, albeit with particle velocities 10 times larger. A comparison of
LIAD with matrix-free direct laser desorption26 of 2Lx shows that LIAD velocities
are generally at least 3 times slower than MALDI.

Substrate Dependence
The choice of foil material also
influences the most probable velocity. A comparison of hemin (Figure 5, 49 m/s) with ZnTPP (Figure 7, 177 m/s) shows that LIAD generates 3–5 times slower beams
using titanium foils rather than tantalum. A more detailed comparison
of LIAD with ZnTPP confirms this material dependency (see Figure 8).

Figure 8 Influence of the foil material, foil thickness, and desorption
laser intensity on the most probable velocity of the molecular beam
of ZnTPP. Three different foils were used: tantalum (8 and 12.5 μm)
and titanium 12.5 μm. The velocity is largely independent from
the laser power and the foil thickness in this range. It decreases,
however, substantially when we replace tantalum by titanium.

For a given foil material and
thickness, different desorption laser
intensities change the overall flux but not the beam velocity (Figure 8). This finding is in good agreement with previous
studies.4 In Figure 8 we find no dependence of particle velocity on the foil thickness
even though thinner metal sheets are expected to reach higher surface
temperatures. Many mechanisms have been suggested to explain this
substrate dependence. Zinovev et al.4 proposed
that molecular microcrystals on the sample may not be in their minimal
energy state. During the desorption process, these crystals may thus
eject the analyte molecules with an excess energy. It depends on the
foil and the analyte material and is expected to be higher for tantalum
than for titanium. In addition, the desorption laser deforms the foil,
forming dimples and bumps on the back and front side of the metal
sheet. Finally, substrate particles are coejected in the desorption
process.28 Thus, energy will not only be
transferred by heating but also through mechanical stress. The shock-wave
induced longitudinal pressure on the surface is larger for tantalum
than for titanium. As a result, the velocity of the desorbed molecules
is also expected to be higher for tantalum.

Conclusion and
Outlook
We have demonstrated that LIAD enables natural biochromophores
and massive, functionalized porphyrins to be launched into the gas
phase with only minor fragmentation in all cases but one. LIAD can
be performed in high vacuum close to the acceptance volume of a mass
spectrometer, which is a benefit for analytical chemistry. Single
photon postionization at 157.6 nm is a sensitive and specific preparation
tool for many molecules below 2000 Da.29

In addition, we find that laser-induced acoustic desorption
emits
very slow molecular beams, which is useful for numerous experiments
in chemistry and physics. Long interaction times are important for
precision spectroscopy where gains in resolution typically scale with
1/v. In classical13,30 and quantum
deflectometry,18 low velocities are even
more important as the resolution scales with 1/v2.31 The analyte velocity also determines
its de Broglie wavelength in matter-wave interferometers. LIAD of
biliverdin or chlorophyll provides beams with λdB = 2 × 10–11 m, i.e., 10 times longer than
in typical thermal beams of molecules with a similar mass.17

The slow velocities obtained using LIAD
are comparable to those
realized through electric,16 magnetic,32 or mechanical33 slowing
methods. However, slowing has only been demonstrated for atoms and
small molecules so far.

Laser desorption into an adiabatically
expanding gas jet provides
an equally soft method to launch biomolecules34 and even large amino acid clusters35 into
the gas phase with a narrow velocity distribution. In comparison,
LIAD beams are typically 5–10 times slower.

For particles
around m = 25 000 Da,36 we observed velocities as low as 6 m/s in our
LIAD experiments. This may one day enable a molecular fountain of
neutral molecules. Even lower velocities, v = 1.5
m/s, have been achieved for naphthalene (C10H8) using a cold, effusive buffer gas.37 Demonstrations with fragile biomolecules have, however, remained
a challenge. LIAD is currently the most universal method of generating
slow molecular beams of neutral, or low charge, particles which can
easily be incorporated into existing analytical instruments.
