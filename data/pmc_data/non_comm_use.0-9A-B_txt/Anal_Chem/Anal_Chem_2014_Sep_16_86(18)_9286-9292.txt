Fluorescence detected sedimentation
velocity (FDS-SV) has emerged
as a powerful technique for the study of high-affinity protein interactions,
with hydrodynamic resolution exceeding that of diffusion-based techniques,
and with sufficient sensitivity for binding studies at low picomolar
concentrations. For the detailed quantitative analysis of the observed
sedimentation boundaries, it is necessary to adjust the conventional
sedimentation models to the FDS data structure. A key consideration
is the change in the macromolecular fluorescence intensity during
the course of the experiment, caused by slow drifts of the excitation
laser power, and/or by photophysical processes. In the present work,
we demonstrate that FDS-SV data have inherently a reference for the
time-dependent macromolecular signal intensity, resting on a geometric
link between radial boundary migration and plateau signal. We show
how this new time-domain can be exploited to study molecules exhibiting
photobleaching and photoactivation. This expands the application of
FDS-SV to proteins tagged with photoswitchable fluorescent proteins,
organic dyes, or nanoparticles, such as those recently introduced
for subdiffraction microscopy and enables FDS-SV studies of their
interactions and size distributions. At the same time, we find that
conventional fluorophores undergo minimal photobleaching under standard
illumination in the FDS. These findings support the application of
a high laser power density for the detection, which we demonstrate
can further increase the signal quality.

Sedimentation
velocity (SV)
analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) is a classical technique of physical
biochemistry that allows observing the strongly size-dependent migration
and diffusion of macromolecules in the gravitational field of an ultracentrifuge.1 In recent decades, the introduction of modern
computational analysis, among them direct boundary modeling with numerical
solutions of the partial differential equation of centrifugal transport,2−4 the Lamm
equation (eq 5), and their use as a kernel in
the differential sedimentation coefficient distribution c(s)6 and its multispectral
extension ck(s),7−9 in combination with progress in the theory of sedimentation of interacting
systems4,10−13 have significantly expanded the
sensitivity, resolution, and scope of applications of SV. The latter
span a wide range of topics, including protein and other macromolecular
interactions,14 multiprotein complexes,15,16 hydrodynamic modeling,17,18 the quantitation of
trace oligomers in the pharmaceutical industry,19 and the characterization of nanoparticles.20 Furthermore, SV is highly complementary to other biophysical
techniques for studying multisite protein interactions in solution,
due to the potential of simultaneously resolving size and population
of different coexisting states and can be quantitatively combined
with data from isothermal titration calorimetry, surface plasmon resonance,
and/or fluorescence polarization.21,22

Fluorescence
optical detection for AUC has been developed by several
groups,23−26 and a design by Laue and co-workers27,28 resembling
a moveable confocal microscope was recently developed into a commercially
available accessory for AUC by AVIV Biomedical, Inc. FDS-SV has the
potential for a further transformation of SV, chiefly due to its many
orders of magnitude greater sensitivity, which brings it into the
same concentration range as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy29 and below. This was exploited in many applications
to study the size distribution, conformation, and interactions of
proteins and assemblies.30−43 Initially, the majority of applications were aimed at more qualitative
questions of protein oligomeric states in dilute solutions or in crowded
environments,27,28 partly due to concerns of signal
nonlinearity and photobleaching leading to limited accuracy.27,28,30 However, the analysis has undergone
rapid development, and we and others have demonstrated the potential
for highly quantitative analyses and for determination of binding
constants in high-affinity protein interactions.37,43−48 In particular, taking advantage of the statistical properties of c(s) analysis, and using Raman scattering
of water as a meniscus marker, we have demonstrated low picomolar
detection limits, allowing the determination of the binding energy
of very high-affinity systems with KD as
low as 20 pM.47 Further, we and others
have shown that signal linearity is usually not a concern at nM concentrations
and below.45,46 In fact, the intrinsic data quality
is superb, leading to fits with models for macromolecular sedimentation
and diffusion that rival that of the best conventional detection system,
but only after characteristic data structure of this detection system
is accounted for.46 Besides factors governed
by beam geometry and out-of-plane movement of the focal point, a slowly
time-dependent drift in the signal intensity was recognized as a crucial
component of the boundary model.46

In the present work, we explore the time-dependent signal intensity
changes in closer detail, using as models fluorescent protein variants
and FITC-labeled protein. We show that the evolution of signal boundary
profiles in SV offers an internal reference of intrinsic signal intensity
and its changes with time. We demonstrate that an additional time-domain
for signal intensity changes of fluorophores can be folded into the
boundary analysis, such that it retains a reliable measurement of
the macromolecular sedimentation parameters. As a result, it is possible
to study a wider range of fluorophores, especially now including photoswitchable
fluorescent proteins and organic dyes which may decrease or increase
their fluorescence upon excitation and are frequently used in super-resolution
fluorescence microscopy. At the same time, we find that photobleaching
of standard fluorophores such as EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent
protein) and FITC is negligible under illumination conditions in FDS-SV.
Finally, we demonstrate the improved signal/noise ratio with a higher
powered laser than previously in use.

Methods
Fluorescent
Proteins
The cDNA for Dronpa49 was purchased from Amalgaam (Nagoya, Japan),
amplified using the N-terminal primer 5″-GACGGATCCATGAGTGTGATTAAAC-3″
containing a BamHI site and the C-terminal primer
5″-GACGAATTCTTACTTGGCCTGCC-3″ containing an EcoRI site, and cloned into pRSETA (Invitrogen). Plasmid
(pQE31) containing the cDNA for histidine tagged Padron50 was a gift from Stefan Jakobs. All proteins
including enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were prepared
as described previously.46 Bovine serum
albumin (BSA, #A7030, Sigma, St. Louis) was fluorescently labeled
with FITC using standard amine coupling chemistry (#53027, Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). Unless mentioned otherwise, proteins
were used at a concentration of 100 nM dissolved in phosphate buffered
saline (PBS), pH 7.4.

Fluorescence Detected Sedimentation Velocity
Analytical Ultracentrifugation
FDS-SV experiments were carried
out in an Optima XL-A analytical
ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) with a fluorescence
detection system FDS (Aviv Biomedical Inc., Lakewood, NJ). The FDS
instrument used was equipped with an operating software-adjustable
50 mW diode laser at 488 nm, which is a feature of all currently built
FDS instruments. This adjustable laser has replaced the fixed power
10 mW solid-state laser (an integrated package of an infrared laser
diode frequency doubled to 488 nm) that was used in older instruments
but discontinued in 2013 by the laser manufacturer.

Emission
is collected between 505 and 565 nm with a standard bandpass filter.
Briefly, 400 μL samples of protein dissolved in phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) to final concentrations between 50 and 500 nM were loaded
in cell assemblies with standard 12 mm double sector centerpieces,
inserted in a eight-hole rotor, and placed in the chamber of the ultracentrifuge
which was evacuated to high vacuum (zero or a few micron pressure).
The laser power was adjusted to the target level and warmed up for
at least 10 min. For adjustment of the detection settings, the rotor
was accelerated to a rotor speed of 3000 rpm. At a focal depth of
4 mm, photomultiplier voltage and gain were set as to allow for data
acquisition with a signal/noise ratio on the order of 100:1, at the
same time not exceeding ∼3000 counts/s. Angular data acquisition
windows were adjusted for each cell conservatively to eliminate signal
contributions from the autofluorescence of the charcoal-filled Epon
centerpiece. As described previously,48 after optics adjustments at 3000 rpm, it is necessary to stop the
run, to allow for a well-defined start of the sedimentation process.51 When working with photoswitchable molecules
and at high laser power, a potential concern is that the stationary
illumination during this phase may potentially cause local photophysical
effects creating a blip or dip in intensity. To create uniform conditions,
it may be necessary to resuspend the solution after the initial optics
adjustment; otherwise the first few scans will have to be discarded
until diffusion has diminished this local feature. Gently rotating
the cell assemblies will also resuspend material that may have settled
at the low centrifugal field. Temperature was equilibrated at 20 °C
for between 1 and 3 h at rest, prior to rotor acceleration from 0
to 50 000 rpm. Fluorescence scans were acquired at the highest
possible rate for 10 h. Data were processed with the automatic sorting
function for FDS data in SEDFIT and analyzed in the same software
taking into account the structure of fluorescence scan data,46 with the extensions described below. In the
calculations, the standard solvent density and viscosity was used,
with a protein partial specific volume of 0.73 mL/g. All plots were
created with GUSSI (kindly provided by Dr. Chad Brautigam).

Data Analysis
The experimental sedimentation data a(r,t) were modeled with
an extension of the c(s) distribution,6 where we have replaced the kernel from being
a simple normalized Lamm equation solution χ1(r,t) that describes the spatiotemporal
evolution of the concentration distribution of ideally sedimenting
species at unit concentration,2,52 by the signal χ̃1(r,t) that would be measured
with the fluorescence optical system for the same ensemble of particles.
To this end, the signals were expressed as a radial convolution 1  (with the normalization factor for convolution N–1 = ∫r–3σr+3σ e–(r–r)2/σ2 dr′) to
account simultaneously for the limited optical resolution
with half-width σ,46 the factor B(rb, δ, r) with 2  to describe the shadow from obstruction
of
the excitation and/or emission cone by the sample holder at the end
of the solution column at radius rb, obscuring part of the circular beam with diameter δ,46 as well as the factor 3  for
describing the linearly changing signal
magnification with radius. The latter is normalized relative to the
meniscus position rm, with the constant
coefficient αr ≡ dM/dr, and caused by the unavoidable misalignment
of the plane of rotation with the line of optical focus through the
sample.46

Most important in the present
context is the temporal modulation T(t). In our previous work, we expressed this as a linearly increasing
function (1 + αtt) with the constant
coefficient αt to account for a temporal laser drift.46 For the present context, we have extended this
by a single-exponential process 4  with a rate constant k toward
a new steady-state amplitude A that can be completely
(A = 0) or partially (0 < A <
1) photobleached or photoactivated (A > 1; with A = 1 describing a temporally constant signal).

It
is instructive to consider the source of information on these
slowly time-dependent processes: In concentration units, the solution
χ(r,t) of the Lamm equation 5  due to the mass balance in sector-shaped geometry,
obeys the square dilution law 6  that firmly links the ratio
of plateau concentrations
(cplateau) and loading concentration (c0) at any time to the radial position of the
boundary midpoint (rmid). However, under
the influence of a temporal modulation of signal intensity the plateau
signals will deviate from eq 6. In fact, in
a simplistic analysis assuming a hypothetical diffusion free sedimentation
process, one could even determine the temporal modulation directly
from the plateau signals as 7  

However, this is not attempted due to the diffusion broadening
of the boundaries and ubiquitous sample imperfections (especially
polydispersity) making it very difficult to accurately define a single
boundary midpoint. On the other hand, in the form of eq 4, an explicit model for the temporal modulation of signal
can be incorporated into the sedimentation model such as to take advantage
of the same source of information intrinsic to SV data.

Proceeding
from here as in the standard c(s) method, the data are modeled as a superposition of such
signals χ̃1(r,t) from species with sedimentation coefficients s and a diffusion coefficient D(s), superimposed by a radial-dependent but temporally constant TI
baseline term b(r)53,54 8  where D(s) is calculated with the standard hydrodynamic scaling law for compact
particles and scaled by a signal-average frictional-ratio f/f0, which is adjusted in nonlinear
regression of the experimental data.55 After
an initial fit determining the beam diameter δ and an estimate
of the meniscus position rm, the left
fitting limit was adjusted to a radius of approximately rm + δ, so as not to include reflection and refraction
effects from the meniscus in the data set to be analyzed.

Results
As a test for the theoretical model of sedimentation including
photophysical processes, we acquired FDS-SV data of Dronpa, a monomeric
mutant of a fluorescent coral protein developed as a reversibly photoswitchable
molecule,49 currently widely used in cell
biological applications and super-resolution microscopy.56,57 In order to create a comprehensive data set with varying degrees
of photobleaching or photoswitching to an off state, as a test whether
macromolecular sedimentation properties could be modeled in all cases,
the laser power of the 488 nm excitation beam was varied in consecutive
experiments, using settings of 50.2 mW, 8.4 mW, and 2.1 mW. Lower
laser power was partially compensated for by using higher photomultiplier
voltages and gain settings to keep the signal/noise ratio high. Data
were acquired for a duration of ∼6 h, after which the concentration
boundary has traversed the solution column at a rotor speed of 50 000
rpm (Figure 1). In deviation from conventionally
detected SV, they all possess the expected characteristic structure
of FDS data previously reported,46 including
a radial-dependent increase in the signal magnification from scanning
out of plane of rotation (not to be confused with sloping plateaus
due to aggregate formation, which is confined to early scans only),
and a drop in signal intensity close to the end of the solution column
from the shadow of the sample holder (dashed red line and red arrow
in Figure 1A). In addition, a very strong depletion
of the plateau signal with time can be discerned. In Figure 1, it is highlighted by the gray vertical arrows,
which measure the relative decrease of the plateau for equivalent
scans where the boundary has moved approximately 4 mm into the solution
column. This feature is most obvious in the data at 50.2 mW, and less
at 8 mW. For reference, the depletion of the plateau signal at 2 mW
corresponds to solely the geometrically imposed square dilution law;
in fact, only a statistically insignificant increase in the rmsd of
fit from 5.944 to 5.956 is obtained when not allowing for any time-dependent
drift (T(t) = 1.0 at all times),
indicating the absence of detectable photobleaching. Conversely, any
excess vertical spread of boundary plateau signals visually indicates
the temporal modulation of signal T(t) (eq 7).

Dronpa at 50 000 rpm,
with 488 nm excitation at laser power settings of 50.2 mW (A), 8.4
mW (B), and 2.1 mW (C), and emission detected through a standard 505–565
nm bandpass with photomultiplier and gain settings adjusted to keep
the signal in an appropriate range. Shown in the upper panels are
data points (symbols) and best-fit model (lines) following eq 8 with exponential decay T(t) as in eq 4, with αt = 0; residuals are shown in the lower panels. The
color temperature indicates the progression of time, violet for early
times and red for late times. Characteristic features of FDS data
are a radial gradient of signal intensity, αr, indicated
by the dashed red line, and a shadow of the end of the solution column,
indicated by the red arrow in panel A. The laser power-dependent temporal
modulation of signal T(t) is indicated
in all plots as gray vertical arrows, which, for visual reference,
highlight the plateau depletion within the first 2.5 h of the sedimentation
process. For the 2.1 mW data, the plateau depletion corresponds to
solely the geometrically imposed radial dilution.

All SV data at all power settings for Dronpa in Figure 1 can be modeled with an excellent quality of fit,
taking into account the slow temporal signal modulation as a single
exponential process (eq 4). The best-fit parameter
estimates are summarized in Table 1. Not surprisingly,
the final signal/rmsd ratio increases with decreasing laser power,
at the highest setting reaching a value of 480, which rivals that
of the best conventional detection systems. The best-fit rate constant
of photobleaching increases roughly proportional with laser power.
As shown in Figure 2, the sedimentation coefficient
distributions c(s) derived from
these fits are essentially indistinguishable at different laser power
settings, all showing a single species with consistent S-values and with consistent best-fit frictional ratios implying apparent
molecular weights of ∼31.9 kDa, which is within uncertainty
of buoyancy consistent with the theoretical molecular weight of 29.6
kDa for the Dronpa construct used (Table 1).
This shows that despite the very substantial photobleaching at the
higher laser power, the sedimentation properties of Dronpa have been
correctly obtained with the sedimentation model of eq 8.

We carried out a control experiment
to independently measure the
time dependence of the fluorescence signal. At a rotor speed of 3000
rpm sedimentation of Dronpa is virtually absent, such that scans with
the FDS are radially uniform and report solely the time-course of
fluorescence, after subtraction of a baseline fluorescence determined
from a final high-speed sedimentation phase depleting the macromolecules.
The resulting decrease of average fluorescence signal across the solution
column for Dronpa at 50.2 mW illumination (Supporting
Information Figure S1) was well described over the 6 h period
by a single exponential with a rate constant of 6.08 × 10–5 s–1. This value compares reasonably
well with the best-fit bleaching rate constants from modeling the
SV data of 7.1 (6.9–7.5, 68% CI) × 10–5 s–1 at 50.2 mW. Slight differences in the rate
constant may arise from different hydrodynamic friction58 or pressure in the two experiments, or from
different scan times. However, the determination of the sedimentation
properties is unaffected by these considerations.

The opposite
temporal behavior is exhibited by Padron,50 as it is switched on with 488 nm excitation,
resulting in signal increases in fluorescence to ∼160% its
initial value at 50.2 mW of illumination in the FDS (Figure 3). The time-constant is 3.9× 10–4 s–1 at 50.2 mW, which causes the signal increment
to attain a steady-state halfway through the sedimentation process.
In the second half of the sedimentation experiment, the dominant effect
is the decrease of plateau signals with time in a way that is coupled
to boundary movement and radial dilution as predicted by the square
dilution law. This time behavior is also very well described with
a superposition of temporally modulated Lamm equation solutions, eq 8. In experiments at intermediate laser power (data
not shown), the photophysical rate constant is lower and the bleaching/activation
steady-state is not reached during the run; therefore a correlation
exists between the temporal signal modulation rate constant and the
extrapolated final amplitude. Like Dronpa, at the lowest laser power,
Padron did not exhibit significant photophysical processes, and a
model with constant signal increment can describe the data well (data
not shown). The resulting c(s) distributions
at the different laser power settings are shown in Figure 3B. They all virtually superimpose, with main peaks
of consistent signal-weighted average sedimentation coefficients and
diffusional boundary spreads implying consistent apparent molecular
weights (Table 1). The control experiment under
high laser power illumination and nonsedimenting conditions provides
a best-fit rate constant in excellent agreement with the SV analysis
(Table 1) but at later times also reveals a
slow time-dependent drift of −0.7%/h (Supporting
Information Figure S1).

The quantum yield for
photoswitching to the off state of Dronpa
is 3.2 × 10–4,49 ∼40–100-fold higher than EGFP photobleaching.59,60 Having determined the experimental switching rate constant of 0.257/h
in FDS-SV at 50.2 mW for Dronpa, at the same illumination we would
expect the experimental bleaching rate for EGFP in FDS-SV to be 40–100-fold
smaller, i.e., < 0.006/h; it is therefore highly unlikely that
any significant photobleaching would be observable with EGFP by FDS-SV
even at the highest power settings, as this value would be within
the error of detection, and additionally be obscured by the observed
laser drift.46 Even more so, at a laser
power of 12 mW, corresponding to the default setting in the FDS systems,
on the basis of the ratios of the quantum yield and the apparent photon
flux in the geometry in the FDS, for EGFP a bleaching rate of ∼0.1%/h
would be expected, i.e. a drop in signal of only ∼ −0.6%
during the entire time-course of sedimentation. We tested this in
FDS-SV experiments with EGFP (Figure 4). Based
on the expectation, the temporal change in the signal increment was
described as a linear drift with the constant coefficient αt. With this model, excellent fits were achieved for EGFP at
any power setting, with best-fit drift parameters describing a positive
increase in signal at a rate of approximately +0.9%/h (Table 1).

Figure 4 Sedimentation of 100 nM EGFP in PBS at 50 000 rpm.
(A) FDS-SV
data acquired at a laser power of 50.2 mW (symbols) and best-fit distributions
(lines) with the c(s) model eq 8 with temporal signal modulation eq 4 consisting of a linear drift factor only, with best-fit αt of +0.86%/h. Residuals are shown in the lower plot. (B) Best-fit c(s) distributions obtained at different
laser excitation power settings.

Since the FDS-SV data of the EGFP samples were acquired side-by-side
in the same centrifuge run as the Padron and Dronpa samples, it is
possible to use this estimate of the laser intensity drift as an independently
measured constraint for the linear drift parameter αt in the samples exhibiting the photophysical signal modulation. For
the 50.2 mW and 8.4 mW Dronpa SV data discussed above, introduction
of this linear drift (constrained to the value estimated from the
EGFP data) in addition to the exponential photobleaching leads to
slightly different photobleaching or photoswitching rate constants
(Table 1) at a statistically indistinguishable
quality of fit. For the 50 mW Padron data, a statistically slightly
better fit was achieved, with an additional constraint of the spatial
signal magnification drift αr in the Padron data
to be fixed to the value estimated from the EGFP data.

In order
to examine the photostability of EGFP under the illumination
of the FDS in different solution conditions, we carried out experiments
at a lower pH of 5.7 and in the presence of the photosensitizer chlorin
e6.61 We could not detect a
significant difference in either the sedimentation behavior or the
temporal stability of the signal to EGFP in PBS at pH 7.4 (Table 1). Similarly, as a further test for photostability
of common dyes in FDS-SV, we studied FITC-labeled BSA. The photobleaching
quantum yield of fluorescein is approximately 4–10-fold higher
than that of EGFP59,60,62 but still an order of magnitude below the photoswitching off rate
of Dronpa. Photobleaching of fluorescein can be observed when the
focal point is stationary (which is observed in the process of optical
alignment in detector maintenance; data not shown). By contrast, during
normal scanning operation of the FDS, there was no indication of bleaching,
even at the highest power setting of 50 mW. The difference can be
attributed to the 2.5° sector angle of the solution column in
centrifugation resulting in a duty cycle of <1%, and the radial
movement of the focal point during the scan. The best fit was achieved
with a small linear drift for an increase in signal with time (data
not shown), at a magnitude statistically indistinguishable from that
seen in the EGFP samples. Only when 10% H2O2 was added to the FITC-BSA solution, photobleaching was achieved
in the FDS at a rate constant of 0.148/h at 50 mW, in addition to
a significant drop in overall signal intensity (data not shown).

Discussion
In the present work, we have demonstrated that SV data inherently
offer information on a time-domain of slowly changing signal intensities
over the time-course of hours during the sedimentation experiment.
This allows fluorescence-detected SV with molecules that exhibit significant
photophysical changes, including irreversible photobleaching or reversible
photoswitching, such as photoswitchable dyes, proteins, and nanoparticles.
Similarly, it should be possible to study molecules undergoing irreversible
photoactivation or photoconversion. In particular, in recent years,
reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent proteins (FPs) have come to
play an important role in emerging techniques such as super-resolution
microscopy, optical control of protein activity, and optical data
storage, and many cell biology studies of protein localization and
function rely on the expression of fusion proteins with reversibly
photoswitchable FPs.57,63−65 Thus, a technique
for carrying out hydrodynamic studies of protein oligomeric states
and protein interactions exploiting FDS-SV should be very useful,
both for the characterization of the self-association of such FPs
and the size-distribution of nanoparticles themselves, as well as
for studies of self- and heterogeneous interactions of proteins expressed
in fusion with photoswitchable FPs (using the same constructs as in
cell biological studies), either in dilute solution or crowded environments
such as cell lysates. Hydrodynamic experiments by FDS-SV on protein
interactions have proven extremely useful in many studies of protein
quaternary structure and function,30−43 and the present work expands this technique to increasingly commonly
used fluorophores.

While many photophysical processes may involve
multiple states,
and in theory require multiexponentials description,66 within the limited time range available for observation
in the SV experiment these were not resolved in the present work.
A single exponential decay described the experimental data of the
photoswitchable molecules under study extremely well, leading to a
quality of fit on par with the best conventionally detected data sets.
It seems possible, however, to incorporate more complicated time-dependencies
into the model in future work.

A second practical finding from
the present study is that standard
fluorophores commonly used in conjunction with the 488 nm excitation
in FDS-SV, such EGFP and fluorescein and its derivatives, would seem
unlikely to undergo significant photobleaching under the scanning
illumination conditions of the FDS, unless applying extreme solvent
conditions. This emerges from considering photobleaching quantum yields
in comparison with the observed rates of signal decrease in FDS-SV
and was corroborated in experiments with FITC-labeled protein and
EGFP in different solvents. This can be attributed to the relatively
low time-average power density any solution region is exposed to during
the scan of the focal point through the solution column. The time-dependent
signal intensity drifts that were previously described27,45,46 can now be attributed to slow
drifts in the laser intensity. However, these drifts do not seem problematic,
as constant drifts can be accounted for in the data analysis as well,46 now in addition to the exponential photophysical
processes. Since the incident laser power is common to all samples,
drifts may be separately measured using EGFP in one of the 14 sample
cells, again making use of the information from the time-dependence
of the plateau signals as an internal reference. This may additionally
be useful as an independent reference for solvent viscosity when working
in complex solvents. Jointly, the apparent absence of significant
photobleaching of GFP and fluorescein, as well as the potential to
account for photophysical processes in the data analysis should they
occur, suggest that there will be little penalty of increasing the
laser power. We would expect this to lead to lower detection limits,
on the basis of the increase in the signal/noise ratio observed here.
