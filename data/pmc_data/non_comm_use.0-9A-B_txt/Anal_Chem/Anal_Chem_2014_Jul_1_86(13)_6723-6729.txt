A hybrid microchip/capillary electrophoresis
(CE) system was developed
to allow unbiased and lossless sample loading and high-throughput
repeated injections. This new hybrid CE system consists of a poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS) microchip sample injector featuring a pneumatic microvalve
that separates a sample introduction channel from a short sample loading
channel, and a fused-silica capillary separation column that connects
seamlessly to the sample loading channel. The sample introduction
channel is pressurized such that when the pneumatic microvalve opens
briefly, a variable-volume sample plug is introduced into the loading
channel. A high voltage for CE separation is continuously applied
across the loading channel and the fused-silica capillary separation
column. Analytes are rapidly separated in the fused-silica capillary, and following separation,
high-sensitivity MS detection is accomplished via a sheathless CE/ESI-MS
interface. The performance evaluation of the complete CE/ESI-MS platform
demonstrated that reproducible sample injection with well controlled
sample plug volumes could be achieved by using the PDMS microchip
injector. The absence of band broadening from microchip to capillary
indicated a minimum dead volume at the junction. The capabilities
of the new CE/ESI-MS platform in performing high-throughput and quantitative
sample analyses were demonstrated by the repeated sample injection
without interrupting an ongoing separation and a linear dependence
of the total analyte ion abundance on the sample plug volume using
a mixture of peptide standards. The separation efficiency of the new
platform was also evaluated systematically at different sample injection
times, flow rates, and CE separation voltages.

Electrospray ionization mass
spectrometry (ESI-MS)-based proteomic and metabolomic analyses1,2 rely on chemical separations prior to ionization to add selectivity,
reduce mass spectral congestion, and minimize ionization suppression
at the electrospray source. Although liquid chromatography (LC) is
the most widely used separation method for “omic” analyses,
capillary electrophoresis (CE) has distinct advantages in the analysis
of ultrasmall samples,3 including single
cells,4−8 for which trace analytes can otherwise be lost on chromatographic
media. CE is also advantageous for performing rapid, high-resolution
separations, particularly in the microchip format.9−11

The injection
method used for CE analyses plays a major role in
the overall separation performance in terms of quantitation, throughput,
sensitivity, and resolution. For CE performed in fused-silica capillaries,
the capillary inlet is transferred from the run buffer to a sample
reservoir, and the sample is injected electrokinetically or hydrodynamically.12 For electrokinetic injection, analytes migrate
into the column under an applied electric field through a combination
of electroosmotic flow and electromigration. For hydrodynamic injection,
a pressure differential across the separation column is used to load
a sample plug onto the column. Although electrokinetic injection enables
simpler instrumentation and greater achievable enrichment factors
when used in combination with sample stacking techniques13 relative to hydrodynamic injection, it preferentially
samples higher mobility ions and, thus, introduces a quantitative
bias that must be carefully accounted for using calibration standards.12 In contrast, hydrodynamic injection produces
a sample plug that is representative of the original sample. For microchip-based
CE injections, electrokinetic injection is generally used, although
efforts to implement hydrodynamic injection for microfluidic separations
have also been explored.14,15 For “gated”
electrokinetic injections,16 sample is
driven to a waste reservoir, and then voltages are adjusted to divert
a portion of the sample into the separation channel for a given period
of time before initiating the separation. The amount of sample loaded
is proportional to the injection time. For “pinched”
injections,17 voltages are arranged and
switched such that only the sample present in the intersection is
injected for separation. As with capillary-based electrokinetic injection,
gated injection preferentially samples high-mobility analytes but
can accommodate a range of sample volumes. In contrast, for pinched
injections, the size of the injected sample plug is fixed by the intersection
volume. Sampling biases are generally less pronounced for pinched
injections but are also present as a result of the mobility-dependent
rate of analyte depletion from the sample reservoir.

The sample
injection process typically interrupts the electric
field in the separation channel such that a separation in process
must be completed prior to the commencement of a subsequent separation.
This has implications for high-throughput measurements because the
time prior to elution of the first analyte is essentially wasted and
the overall duty cycle is reduced. In addition, multiplexed injection
schemes based on the Hadamard or Fourier transform, which can substantially
enhance detection sensitivity, are difficult to implement. These limitations
have spurred development of alternative injection methods that increase
duty cycle and avoid interrupting ongoing separations. For example,
Imasaka and co-workers18 added sample to
the run buffer and used a high-powered laser to photobleach all of
the fluorescent analyte except during sample injection. The light
was modulated in a pseudorandom sequence, and the Hadamard transform
(HT) was applied to realize an ∼8-fold gain in S/N. The same
group also implemented HT–CE for nonfluorescent analytes by
electrokinetically injecting sample into the middle of a capillary
through a laser-etched hole.19 In that
implementation, the potentials applied for separation and injection
had to be carefully balanced to minimize leakage of the run buffer
into the large sample reservoir. Chiu et al.20 developed a unique microfluidic device with an array of separation
channels having different lengths that were loaded with sample simultaneously
and combined into a single detection channel to implement Fourier
transform CE. Price and Culbertson21,22 used an electroactive
polymer at the injection cross of a microchip CE device to rapidly
and repeatedly inject plugs of sample hydrodynamically into the separation
channel while the rest of the sample was diverted to waste. In general,
the ability to perform repeated, overlapping injections comes with
the trade-off of wasting the vast majority of the sample.

We
recently developed a microfluidic CE platform23 that employed a pneumatic microvalve, created using multilayer
soft lithography,24 at the intersection
of a T-shaped channel to hydrodynamically inject sample into the separation
channel. The separation voltage was continuously applied, and when
the valve was briefly opened, a plug of sample was pressure-driven
onto the separation channel. This simple approach enabled rapid and
repeatable overlapping separations, eliminated analyte waste, and
avoided the sampling biases inherent in electrokinetic injections.
The device used poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) as a substrate because
the elastomeric properties of PDMS were required for implementation
of the pneumatic microvalve. Unfortunately, PDMS poses a challenge
for high-resolution separations as a result of its propensity for
analyte adsorption.25 In addition, detection
was limited to laser-induced fluorescence of the analytes due to difficulty
in achieving stable and repeatable CE–MS analyses within monolithic
PDMS devices.

Here, we report on a hybrid microchip/capillary
device for CE–MS
analysis of unlabeled peptides. A T-shaped PDMS microchannel with
a pneumatic microvalve at the intersection is used for programmable
hydrodynamic sample injection, but the microchannel interfaces with
a 20-cm-long fused-silica capillary separation column immediately
following the injection region. The separation column terminates at
a sheathless electrospray interface for high-sensitivity detection
of the separated analytes. The separation was operated in a pressure-assisted
mode to provide a stable flow rate at the ESI source at flow rates
ranging from 20 to 100 nL/min. The platform enables variable sample
injection volumes, no quantitative bias, and repeated, programmable,
overlapping separation for rapid optimization and high-throughput
measurements. The technology is expected to facilitate the rapid analysis
of large numbers of samples as well as multiplexed and multidimensional
separations.

Experimental Section
Materials
Leucine
enkephalin, kemptide, angiotensin
II, methanol, acetic acid, hydrofluoric acid, ammonium acetate, and
hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC, average MW ∼ 100 000)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Water was purified
using a Barnstead Nanopure Infinity system (Dubuque, IA). Peptide
stock solutions were prepared individually in water at a concentration
of 1 mg/mL. A 10 μM mixture of the three peptides was then prepared
by dilution from the stock solutions into the run buffer. The run
buffer was 9:1 of 0.1 M acetic acid in water/methanol. Colored dye
was used as supplied by the manufacturer (ESCO Foods, Inc., San Francisco,
CA) for visualizing pressure-driven injection and transfer of the
sample plug to the capillary. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was purchased
as Dow Corning Sylgard 184 from Ellsworth Adhesives (Germantown, WI).
Fused-silica capillaries were from Polymicro Technologies (Phoenix,
AZ), and acid enduring epoxy (EP42HT-2) was from Masterbond (Hackensack,
NJ).

Microchip Design and Fabrication
A schematic of the
hybrid microfluidic/capillary device is shown in Figure 1. The PDMS microchip was created from three patterned templates:
a control layer, a flow layer and a cover plate, using multilayer
soft lithography. Figure 2 shows an exploded
view of the three aligned PDMS substrates that comprised the microdevice.
Template fabrication was similar to previous work.26 The control layer channel was 25 μm tall and 100
μm wide and was rectangular in cross section. The flow layer channels were ∼10 μm tall and 100 μm
wide and were rounded in cross section to enable complete channel
closure using the on-chip pneumatic valve.24 To accommodate in-line insertion of a fused-silica capillary with
the microchannel, the flow channel terminated at a channel that had
a rectangular cross section, a height of 160 μm, and a width
of 310 μm. The cover plate contained a channel of rectangular
cross section that was 310 μm wide and 110 μm thick.

the microfluidic
device.

PDMS was prepared by thoroughly
mixing Sylgard 184 base and curing
agent at a 10:1 ratio. The PDMS was poured onto the control layer
template and spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 30 s. PDMS was also poured
over the flow layer and cover plate templates to a thickness of 3–4
mm and degassed under vacuum. All substrates were cured at 70 °C
for 2 h. The flow layer substrate was then removed from its template,
and holes were formed using a 20-gauge catheter punch (Syneo, West
Palm Beach, FL). Debris was removed from the substrate by applying
compressed nitrogen, followed by Scotch Magic Tape (3M, St. Paul,
MN) to both sides. The surfaces of the flow layer and control layer
substrates were activated in an oxygen plasma system (PX-250, March
Plasma Systems, Westlake, OH) at 50 W power and 200 mTorr pressure
for 30 s. Following activation, the flow layer substrate was aligned
at the sample introduction intersection and brought into contact with
the control layer with the aid of a digital microscope (Keyence VHX-600,
Osaka, Japan). The irreversibly bonded assembly was placed in an oven
at 70 °C for 1 h to improve bond strength, and then the bonded
flow and control substrates were cut and removed from the control
layer template. It was necessary to remove the portion of the membrane
that spanned the capillary insertion channel. This was accomplished
by grasping the suspended membrane with a pair of fine-tipped tweezers
and carefully pulling in such a way that the membrane tore along the
channel walls. A hole was punched through both substrates as described
above to provide access to the pneumatic valve, and the assembly was
again cleaned using a combination of compressed nitrogen and Scotch
tape. The microchip was completed by aligning and bonding the flow
and control layers to the cover plate as described above.

Fused-Silica
Capillary Preparation and Device Assembly
Fused-silica capillaries
having an o.d. of 140 μm and an i.d.
of 30 μm were passivated with HPC to suppress electroosmotic
flow. The coating was prepared by first flushing the fused-silica
capillary with 1 mL of 1 M HCL solution, followed by flushing the
capillary with 200 μL of 5% HPC in water. The capillary was
then flushed with deionized water to remove excess HPC. The treated
capillary was subsequently cut into equal lengths, and ∼3 cm
at the end of each length was chemically etched in 49% HF to render
it porous for electrical contact as described previously.27 The etching of capillaries took place in bundles
with each batch providing ∼10 capillaries using an approach
adapted from previous work.28 Note that
HF is extremely corrosive, and its use requires at a minimum a fume
hood, goggles, rubber gloves, and an apron. The distal end (inlet)
of the capillary was then sheathed using an ∼5 cm length of
360-μm-o.d., 150-μm-i.d. capillary and sealed in place
with epoxy to provide easy assembly and better size matching with
the microfluidic device. This sheathed end was cut a few mm from the
inlet using a dicing saw (SYJ-400, MTI Corp., Richmond, CA) to provide
a clean interface at the microchip–capillary transition. Alternatively,
a 360-μm-o.d., 30-μm-i.d. capillary can be used for separation,
rendering the sheath capillary unnecessary, but the etching time will
be much longer. The porous emitter was housed in a metal tube through
a PEEK tee (Upchurch Scientific, Oak Harbor, WA) (Figure 1A) as described in our previous work.27 The emitter end of the etched capillary protruded
1–2 mm from the metal tube. The capillary inlet end was then
inserted under a microscope into the 3 mm-long capillary-accepting
channel on the microchip, and a small amount of PDMS was applied at
the microchannel–capillary interface. The PDMS was cured by
placing the assembly in an oven at 110 °C for 20 min.

Device
Operation
The controller and software interface
for the microfluidic valve have been described previously.23,26 The tygon tubing used to connect the valve controller to the on-chip
valves was filled with water, and a pressure of 20 psi was applied
to purge all air from the microvalves, thus preventing the introduction
of bubbles into the flow channels.23 With
the valve closed, a few microliters of sample was loaded into a pipet
tip (part no. 37001-150, VWR, Radnor, PA), which was then press-fitted
into the sample port on the chip. To pressurize the sample, a length
of tubing connected to a digital pressure controller (PCD-100PSIG-D-IPC-PCV10,
Alicat Scientific, Tucson, AZ) was inserted into a round PDMS plug,
which was in turn pressed into the wide end of the pipet tip to form
an airtight seal. The sample was pressurized to 5 psi to dead-end-fill
the sample against the closed valve, and then the sample pressure
was adjusted as needed for operation. The CE run buffer was loaded
into a sample vial that was then sealed to allow a N2 back
pressure to be applied to the buffer liquid, as shown in Figure 1A. High voltage for CE operation was applied to
a platinum wire inserted into the buffer solution using a Glassman
High Voltage power supply (High Bridge, N. J.). A transfer fused-silica
capillary (360 μm o.d., 50 μm i.d.) with one end inserted
into the buffer solution and the other end press-fitted into the microfluidic
chip using a short length of Tygon sheath tubing was used to provide
the CE run buffer to the device.29 The
N2 back pressure controlling the flow through the CE capillary,
referred to as the eluting pressure, was regulated using a second
digital pressure controller (Alicat Scientific). A second voltage
of ∼2 kV was applied to the metal tube at the capillary outlet
through a Bertan power supply (Hauppauge, N. Y.) for stable electrospray
operation.

MS Operation and Data Processing
All CE-nanoESI-MS
analyses were performed using a triple quadruple mass spectrometer
(TSQ Quantum Ultra, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The inlet
capillary of the mass spectrometer was maintained at 200 °C.
Mass spectra were acquired in full scan mode covering an m/z range from 300 to 1000 at an acquisition rate
of 2 Hz. For data analysis, the raw MS files were processed using
Thermo Xcalibur Qual Browser 2.2. Extracted ion electropherograms
were obtained using m/z ranges of
386–388, 524–526, and 555.5–557.5 for kemptide,
angiotensin II, and leucine enkephalin, respectively. The resulting
electropherograms were exported to Microsoft Excel for further processing.

Results and Discussion
The microfluidic portion of the platform
comprises a simple tee
channel with a “push-up” microvalve30 at the intersection that separates the sample injection
channel from the separation channel. This arrangement offers several
advantages over common injection strategies for both microfluidic
and capillary-based CE. CE in capillaries requires the capillary inlet
to be physically transferred between sample and run buffer reservoirs
for either pressure-based or electrokinetic injection. This can reduce
measurement throughput and makes the injection of very narrow bands
difficult. Microchip CE using gated injection enables variable sample
loading based on injection time, but with a strong quantitative bias
(as with capillary-based electrokinetic injection). Pinched microfluidic
injection enables the formation of very narrow sample plugs for fast,
efficient separations, but the injected volume is fixed by the device
geometry, and a quantitative bias may still be present because of
more rapid depletion of high-mobility species from the sample reservoir.
In contrast, our injector allows the separation voltage to be continuously
applied and a variable-volume sample plug to be injected without interrupting
an ongoing separation, thus enabling higher throughput and rapid optimization
of the separation conditions.

Device fabrication was largely
straightforward using multilayer
soft lithography. Fabrication utilized three different patterned templates
to create the flow, control, and cover plate layers, and the flow
layer comprised two aligned and separately patterned lithography steps.
All layers were created from a single photomask using a previously
described approach,31 which substantially
reduced the time and cost required for glass photomask production.
To insert the capillaries in-line with the microchannel and provide
a seamless transition from microchannel to capillary, it was necessary
to remove the membrane that spanned the insertion channel. This was
performed using fine-tipped tweezers and had variable results. When
the membrane tore cleanly at the microchannel–capillary interface,
a leak-free junction could be formed by simply pressing the capillary
firmly against the microchannel inlet such that the PDMS material
served as a gasket for the capillary end. Otherwise, it was necessary
to introduce uncured PDMS around the capillary and then cure at elevated
temperature. The latter approach became the default procedure to avoid
needing to test each device for leaks.

A pressure-driven injection
sequence is shown in Figure 3 using an aqueous
dye in place of the sample and
in the absence of an electric field. The eluting and sample pressures
were 2.0 and 2.5 psi, respectively, and the valve opening time was
65 ms. The interfaced capillary had an i.d. of 30 μm and was
75 mm long. To estimate the volume of this and other sample plugs,
it was necessary to know the cross-sectional area of the rounded microchannel.
This was determined by filling the separation channel in both the
microchip and capillary with perfluorodecalin, an immiscible oil,
injecting colored dye from the sample channel, and comparing the length
of the plug in the microchannel and inside the capillary of known
diameter. It was determined that the microchannel had a cross-sectional
area of 450 μm2, equivalent to a 24-μm-diameter
capillary. The injection volume shown in Figure 3 was approximately 400 pL, a plug size typical of microchip electrophoresis,
and the volume could easily be tuned larger or smaller by adjusting
the valve opening time and the sample injection pressure. For the
eluting pressures evaluated here, the flow rate was found to range
from ∼20 to 100 nL/min, calculated by the migrating velocity
of the dye plug. These flow rates are in the nanoflow regime, enabling
high ionization efficiency for improved MS detection.32

Additional description is in the text.

The number of theoretical plates was evaluated as a function
of
separation potential for initial characterization of the hybrid CE
separation and was calculated using the formula  where tr is the
retention time and w is the baseline peak width.
As expected, the plate number increases linearly with the voltage,
as shown in Figure 4, albeit with a y-intercept offset from the origin resulting from the pressure-assisted
mode of separation. Further increasing the separation potential above
13 kV in an attempt to increase separation efficiency resulted in
occasional electrical breakdown in the channels in our current setup,
so 13 kV was used as the optimal operating parameter for subsequent
experiments to achieve reproducible and safe operation.

Figure 4 Theoretical
plates for leucine enkephalin as a function of separation
potential. For each separation, the injection and elution pressures
were 2 psi and the injection time was 500 ms.

The computer-controlled, pressure-driven injection method
described
here enables significant flexibility and easy tuning of separation
conditions, as well as rapid and automated acquisition of those separations.
As an example, Figure 5 shows a continuous
separation of repeated injections of a three-peptide mixture containing
kemptide, angiotensin II and leucine enkephalin. During this experiment,
the valve was opened every 1.25 min to inject the sample, and the
valve opening time was varied from 0.1 to 3 s throughout the series.
The trend of increasing peak intensity with injection time is clear
and linear, indicating leak-free, accurate and rapid sample injection
through the pneumatic valve based microchip. The capability for uninterrupted
acquisition of repeated separations under different conditions provides
straightforward manipulation for experiment operation in aspects of
system optimization and automation. In addition, in contrast to common
injection techniques that send the vast majority of sample to waste
to accomplish an efficient injection or require a large sample reservoir,
our approach enables a minimum volume (a few microliters in the present
work) of sample to be loaded by pipet onto the device and for that
entire sample to be used for repeated injections. This will be useful
for multiplexed separations to improve signal-to-noise ratio and for
the analysis of precious biological samples.

Figure 5 Automated, repeated injections
of sample mixture containing kemptide,
angiotensin II, and leucine enkephalin (in order of highest to lowest
mobility) with fixed interval of 1.25 min. Sample injection times
from left to right were 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 s.

The trade-off between separation
efficiency and S/N as the injection
volume is varied is shown in Figure 6. In part
A, the number of theoretical plates as a function of injection time
is shown for three different elution pressures. Values were calculated
for the leucine enkephalin peak. Higher flow rates resulted in reduced
plate counts due to increased Taylor dispersion, and in each case,
smaller injection plugs produced narrower detected peaks and, thus,
greater plate counts. The modest separation efficiency achieved here
is due to the pressure-assisted mode of operation, as even at the
lowest pressure used (1 psi providing a flow rate of ∼20 nL/min),
Taylor dispersion degraded separation performance. We will explore
alternative strategies, such as the CITP-based sample stacking/separation,
to counterbalance Taylor dispersion27 or
the recently developed electrokinetically driven sheath-flow interface3,33 to achieve high-resolution CE–MS separations and avoid the
pressure-driven flow used here. Although plate count diminished with
increasing injection times, the S/N showed the opposite trend, increasing
with longer injections. Part B shows the S/N for kemptide for three
replicate measurements using 2 psi for both the sample injection and
the elution pressure. Noise was calculated from the data points in
the range of 0.4–0.2 min before the apex of each peak. Part
C shows two overlaid kemptide peaks normalized to 100% intensity,
one acquired from a 0.3 s injection, and the other, from a 3 s injection.
The peak resulting from a 0.3 s injection is clearly narrower than
that from the 3 s injection, but the S/N is also substantially reduced,
as reflected in the baseline adjacent to the peak, which is expected
for lower sample loading amounts under nonstacking separation conditions.

time. (A) Theoretical plates vs injection time for leucine enkephalin.
Separation potential was 13 kV for each separation. The eluting and
injection pressures were both 1 (◆), 2 (■), and 4 psi

injection pressures were both 2 psi. Error bars are standard deviation
for three replicate separations. (C) Kemptide peak resulting from
0.3 and 3 s injections (2 psi eluting and injection pressures).

In addition to the ability to
perform repeated, waste-free, programmable
injections without impacting ongoing separations, another key benefit
of the platform is that sample injection is pressure-based and expected
to avoid quantitative biases inherent in electrokinetic injection
strategies. We verified this by evaluating the peak area for each
of the peptides in the mixture for injection times ranging from 0.3
to 7 s under constant pressure. As shown in Figure 7, the peak area for each analyte increases linearly with injection
time, and as such, the proportionality between peptides is maintained,
even across this range of injection times spanning more than a factor
of 20.

and leucine enkephalin (▲) as a function of injection time.

Conclusions and Outlook
We have
demonstrated a microfluidic valve-based pressure injector
for use with capillary-based CE–MS analyses. The computer-controlled
pneumatic microvalve enables volumes ranging from picoliters to nanoliters
to be injected based on valve opening time and injection pressure,
and a seamless interface from microchannel to capillary prevents sample
losses and large dead volumes. None of the sample is wasted in the
injection process, and the remaining sample can be injected repeatedly
under different conditions (e.g., injection times) for rapid optimization
of the analysis and potentially for improved detection by multiplexing.
Because the injection is pressure-based, no quantitative bias is observed.
The ability to rapidly inject a sample without interrupting an ongoing
separation has implications for high-throughput analyses because the
otherwise wasted time prior to elution of the first peak can be effectively
utilized. Although only a single valve was employed here, this work
opens the door for the powerful sample handling capabilities of multilayer
soft lithography to be applied to CE analyses. For example, on-column
sample derivatization34 will be feasible
by simultaneously opening opposing valves containing sample and label.26 In addition, multiplexed valving strategies30 enable a large number of input channels to be
addressed using a modest number of valves (e.g., 128 inputs controlled
with 14 valves). Adapting this approach to CE will enable the high-throughput
analysis of large numbers of samples for, e.g., measurement of prefractionated
samples from an orthogonal separation.
