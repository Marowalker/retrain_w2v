The specific interaction
between a ligand and a protein is a key
component in minimizing off-target effects in drug discovery. Investigating
these interactions with membrane protein receptors can be quite challenging.
In this report, we show how spectral variance observed in surface-enhanced
Raman scattering (SERS) and tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) can
be correlated with ligand specificity in affinity-based assays. Variations
in the enhanced Raman spectra of three peptide ligands (i.e., cyclic-RGDFC,
cyclic-isoDGRFC, and CisoDGRC), which have different binding affinity
to αvβ3 integrin, are reported from isolated proteins
and from receptors in intact cancer cell membranes. The SERS signal
from the purified proteins provides basis spectra to analyze the signals
in cells. Differences in the spectral variance within the SERS and
TERS data for each ligand indicate larger variance for nonspecific
ligand–receptor interactions. The SERS and TERS results are
correlated with single particle tracking experiments of the ligand-functionalized
nanoparticles with purified receptors on glass surfaces and living
cells. These results demonstrate the ability to elucidate protein–ligand
recognition using the observed vibrational spectra and provide perspective
on binding specificity for small-molecule ligands in intact cell membranes,
demonstrating a new approach for investigating drug specificity.

==== Body
The recognition
of a ligand
by a protein receptor is a key interaction that triggers biological
processes ranging from intercellular communication to intracellular
signaling. Understanding ligand–receptor binding is crucial
for both the regulation of these biological processes and their manipulation
in drug development research. Membrane receptors are common targets
for therapeutic drugs.1 However, monitoring
how a drug interacts with a protein receptor on a molecular level
is quite challenging. Ligand–receptor binding assays are often
based on affinity or use purified receptors without the environmental
constraints of the cellular membrane.

Among various ligand–receptor
binding assays, surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) is the most common label-free ligand-binding assay
for protein receptors. In SPR the isolated and purified receptor is
immobilized on the SPR sensor chip, and the interaction with ligands
is monitored to provide both binding affinity and kinetics.2 Recently, microscopic techniques including fluorescence-based
super resolution microscopy3,4 and atomic force microscopy5,6 have been developed to visualize the interactions between ligands
and receptors in the cell membrane with spatial resolution below the
diffraction limit. Though all of the above-mentioned techniques are
able to reveal the biophysical properties like binding affinity and
kinetics, they lack the capability to provide molecular information
about the ligand–receptor binding complexes. Structure-based
ligand binding assays, such as nuclear magnetic resonance7,8 and X-ray crystallography,9,10 are able to analyze
the structure of receptors and the molecular details of ligand–receptor
interactions. However, these methods assay isolated receptors, which
can be difficult and time-consuming. A technique that can investigate
the molecular nature of ligand–receptor binding in intact cell
membranes may significantly facilitate the process of drug development.

Raman spectroscopy is an intriguing method to investigate the structures
of biomolecules in cell membranes by directly measuring their vibrational
modes.11,12 The chemical specific information encoded
in the Raman spectra reveals the identities of the molecules. Furthermore,
signal enhancements by plasmonic nanoparticles (so-called “surface-enhanced
Raman scattering”, SERS) significantly improve the sensitivity
of the technique and enable detection at the single-molecule level.13,14 By attaching a plasmonic nanostructure at the apex of a scanning
probe microscope (SPM) tip, tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) combines
the chemical sensitivity of SERS and nanoscale spatial resolution
of SPM, making it an attractive approach to study the molecular composition
of biomembranes.15,16 Our lab has previously demonstrated
that Raman signals from immobilized receptors binding with specific
ligands attached to a gold nanoparticle (GNP) can be detected through
plasmonic coupling between ligand-functionalized GNPs and a TERS tip.17−19 Through protein mutation experiments, we have shown that amino acids
near the ligand-binding site are responsible for the observed TERS
signal.19 Recently, we reported that this
targeted-TERS methodology can selectively detect ligand–receptor
binding in intact cell membranes20,21 and differentiate
similar receptors binding with the same ligand, due to differences
in their ligand binding sites.22 These
results indicate that TERS can provide chemical insights into the
structure of specific membrane receptors and demonstrate the potential
of TERS to investigate ligand–receptor binding chemistry within
cell membranes. In addition, single particle tracking (SPT) has been
used to study the dynamics of nanoparticles with respect to the internalization
and trafficking of cell surface receptors.23,24 The ligand-functionalized nanoparticles in the TERS experiments
can also be monitored by SPT, providing valuable information about
dynamic processes and interactions, such as intracellular transport,
nanoparticle entry, and binding to the cell membrane.25,26

To investigate this approach, we chose integrin receptors.
Integrin
receptors are important membrane receptors that regulate cellular
migration, invasion, and proliferation in tumors and are therefore
an appealing target for cancer therapy.27 The known affinity of certain integrins toward peptidomimetic ligands
containing Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) and isoAsp-Gly-Arg (isoDGR) sequences28,29 has resulted in efforts to develop efficient and specific integrin
antagonists drugs based on these peptidomimetics.28 However, challenges remain as evidenced by the recent failure
of a cyclic-RGD based integrin inhibitor in a phase 3 trial for the
treatment of glioblastoma.30 The ability
to specify the chemical interactions between potential drug candidates
and the targeted membrane receptors in cell membranes could facilitate
the drug validation process and help avoid costly late stage trial
failure. We have previously demonstrated the ability of TERS to chemically
characterize cell membrane receptor binding with a ligand-conjugated
nanoparticle.21,22 Here we combine TERS measurements
with SPT experiments to investigate the binding interactions between
αvβ3 integrin and three cyclic-peptides in a human metastatic
colon cancer (SW620) cell line. By correlating TERS and SPT experiments,
we are able to assign molecular information from the ligand–receptor
interaction with the ligand binding affinity.

Experimental Section
Materials
Gold nanoparticles (80 nm citrate NanoXact_
gold) were purchased from nanoComposix (San Diego, CA). Cyclic-RGDFC,
cycli-isoDGRFC, and CisoDGRC peptides were synthesized by Peptide
2.0 Inc. (purity 90%, Chantilly, VA). Purified human integrin αvβ3
protein was purchased from EMD Millipore Corporation (>95%, Temecula,
CA). Poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips were purchased from
BD BioCoat Cellware. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Thermo
Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA). Ultrapure water (18.2 MΩ cm)
from a Barnstead Nanopure filtration system was used for all experiments.

Nanoparticle Functionalization and Characterization
Cysteine-containing
peptides were conjugated to the gold nanoparticles
through a ligand exchange reaction (Scheme 1). All three peptides were prepared at the
same concentration. Briefly, 10 μL of 0.05 mM peptide was mixed
with 1 mL of citrate-GNP (0.05 mg mL–1 or 16.6 pM)
colloid solution. The molar ratio of peptide to GNP was calculated
to be 5.2 × 104:1. After 24 h incubation, the colloidal
solution was centrifuged (10 000 rcf, 12 min) and resuspended
in pure water to remove the excessive and unbound peptides. The peptide-conjugated
gold nanoparticles (peptide-GNPs) were reconstituted in 1 mL of water
and stored at 4 °C for later use.

Different Peptide Ligands (cyclic-RGDFC, cylic-isoDGRFC, and CisoDGRC)
Nanoparticle characterization
was carried out by UV–vis
absorption, dynamic light scattering, and zeta-potential measurements.
UV–vis measurements were performed using a UV-3100PC spectrophotometer
(VWR International, Radnor, PA), coupled with a Deuterium-Tungsten
halogen lamp. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential measurements
were performed using a Zetasizer Nano-ZS system (Malvern, Worcestershire,
U.K.).

SERS Detection of Purified Integrin αvβ3 Bound with
Peptide-GNPs
A total of 10 μL of peptide (cyclic-RGDFC,
cyclic-isoDGRFC, and CisoDGRC) functionalized GNPs were mixed with
4 μL of integrin αvβ3 (0.25 mg mL–1), in 100 μL of 0.1× PBS solution. After 2 h of vortex
mixing, the mixture was concentrated to ∼20 μL through
centrifugation, then dropped onto a clean glass slide, and sealed
with a coverslip. Raman spectra of the αvβ3-bound peptide-GNPs
and peptide-GNPs were acquired using a home-built Raman spectrometer
consisting of a 660 nm diode laser, Isoplane-320 spectrograph, and
ProEM EMCCD (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ). Consecutive Raman
spectra of the nanoparticles were collected with 0.9 mW laser power
and 1 s acquisition time.

Cell Sample Preparation
SW620 cells
were seeded on
poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips to enhance attachment. After
24-h attachment, cells were rinsed with 0.1× PBS and incubated
with 100 μL of peptide-GNPs for 2 h. The unadsorbed nanoparticles
were removed by rinsing with 0.1× PBS several times. Cells were
then fixed with paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS) for 10 min, rinsed with
0.1× PBS and water, and dried before TERS experiments. The SW620
cells were cultured following a previously published procedure.31

TERS Imaging
TERS measurements were
carried out with
a combined AFM-Raman system that has been previously reported.21,22 The system incorporates a commercial AFM microscope (Nanonics MV4000)
and a home-built Raman spectrometer containing a Horiba Jobin Yvon
monochromator. A 633 nm HeNe excitation laser was used to illuminate
the sample. Radial polarization of the laser was achieved using a
liquid-crystal mode converter (ArcOptix), producing a longitudinal
mode at the focus that results in increased enhancement and better
spatial resolution from the TERS tip.32 The TERS tip is a transparent glass tip embedded with gold nanoparticles
(Nanonics Imaging Ltd. Israel). The collected TERS signal was filtered
by a 633 nm dichroic beamsplitter and a 633 nm long pass filter (RazorEdge,
Semrock), dispersed by a 600 g mm–1 grating, and
collected by a CCD camera cooled at −70 °C. TERS maps
were obtained by scanning the sample stage under the TERS tip positioned
in the laser focus. The acquisition time was 1s per pixel and laser
power was measured to be 0.9–1.0 mW to avoid damaging the samples.

Raman data analysis
SERS and TERS spectra and maps
were plotted using Matlab R2015b (Mathworks). Raw SERS spectra of
the peptide-GNPs (with or without αvβ3 binding) were preprocessed
through a weighted least-squares (WLS, Whittaker filter, fifth order
polynomial) automatic baseline subtraction to remove differences due
only to the background in each spectrum. These spectra were used to
decompose the pure components of the SERS data using multivariate
curve resolution (MCR), and further used to classify the TERS data
in order to determine the class of each spectrum in the TERS map.
TERS maps and MCR maps were reconstructed in MATLAB according to single-peak
intensities and MCR scores, respectively. Individual SERS and TERS
spectra of three different peptides bound with αvβ3 were
analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster
analysis (HCA). MCR, PCA, and HCA were performed using PLS toolbox
(eigenvector).

Dark Field Imaging and Single Particle Tracking
Experiments
were performed on an Olympus BX51 microscope. A 565 nm mounted light
emitting diode (Thorlabs, M565L3) was used for bottom illumination.
A condenser focused the excitation light onto the sample. All scattered
light was collected by a water immersion objective (Olympus LUMPLFLN
40XW 0.8 NA) and directed onto a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor
(CMOS) camera (Hamamatsu C11440).

Dark-field time-lapse videos
were recorded for 1–2 min each with a cycle time of 10 ms acquisition
per frame. Minimal intensity projection images and single particle
trajectories from each time-lapse video were calculated in Nikon NIS
Elements Advanced Research software and data analysis was performed
in Matlab 2015b (Mathworks) and Origin 9.0 (OriginLab Corp.).

Results
and Discussion
Investigation of Peptide-GNPs Binding with
Purified Integrin
αvβ3
While peptides containing RGD and isoDGR
sequences are known to bind with integrins, the flanking sequences
are reported to affect the binding selectivity and affinity.29 In this work, we use the three cyclic peptides
with similar structures (cyclic-RGDFC, cyclic-isoDGRFC, and CisoDGRC),
as shown in Scheme 1, to study their interactions with αvβ3 integrin. The
ligands were conjugated onto the GNPs through a covalent Au–S
(Cys) bond. Characterization data of the functionalized GNPs are presented
in Supporting Information (Figure S1 and
Table S1).

SERS measurements of purified integrin αvβ3
mixed with three peptide-GNPs were performed to identify the distinct
spectral features associated with each ligand binding to the integrin.
Consecutive SERS spectra of αvβ3-bound cyclic-RGDFC-GNPs
were acquired (1s acquisition) where GNPs formed plasmon-enhanced
clusters. Figure 1a
shows a heat map constructed from the sequential SERS spectra. Temporal
fluctuations of the SERS signals, including intensity and frequency
variations of vibrational bands, were observed (Figure 1b). Similar spectral variations were also
observed in time-resolved SERS spectra of cyclic-isoDGRFC-GNPs and
CisoDGRC-GNPs bound with αvβ3 (Figure S2). These temporal fluctuations are often seen in SERS spectra
of large single molecules such as proteins,14,33 and are recognized to arise from changes in conformation and orientation
of the molecules interacting with the nanostructures. Indeed, the
temporal fluctuations in SERS signals have been used to access conformational
information on single protein and lipid molecules.34,35 In our experiment, the SERS signal fluctuation is hypothesized to
originate from transient binding between the peptide-GNPs and the
αvβ3 receptor. It is reported that ligand binding changes
the conformation of the αvβ3 integrin receptor.36

cyclic-RGDFC-GNPs
(n = 100). (b) Selected SERS spectra corresponding
to dotted lines in panel a. SERS spectra of cyclic-RGDFC-GNPs and
αvβ3-bound cyclic-RGDFC-GNPs were analyzed with multivariate
curve resolution (MCR) to construct a two-component model. (c) MCR
score distribution plot. (d) Two pure spectral components generated
by MCR were compared with the average SERS spectra of cyclic-RGDFC-GNPs.

In order to analyze the variance
and extract the pure spectral
components, the SERS data were analyzed using multivariate curve resolution
(MCR). The SERS data set, composed of the spectra of αvβ3-bound
cyclic-RGDFC-GNPs (n = 100) and cyclic-RGDFC-GNPs
(n = 300), was analyzed with a two-component MCR
model. The MCR score plot exhibited two separate clusters of data
points, providing a clear classification of two samples (Figure 1c). The two corresponding
spectral components generated by MCR are shown in Figure 1d. Component 1 resembles the
SERS spectra from cyclic-RGDFC-GNPs; while component 2 reflects the
average SERS spectra of αvβ3-bound cyclic-RGDFC-GNPs.
The observed Raman bands are attributable to the amino acids reported
at the ligand-binding site of integrin αvβ3,36,37 including Tyr (641 cm–1, 845 cm–1), Lys (912 cm–1), Ser (1127 cm–1), Trp/Phe (999 cm–1, 1582 cm–1), and some protein backbone bands. More band assignments can be
found in Supporting Information (Table
S2). It is noted that the two-component MCR model captured about 70%
of the variance in the SERS data. The residuals were mainly from the
spectra of αvβ3-bound cyclic-RGDFC-GNPs (Figure S3). The above-mentioned changes in conformation affect
the SERS signal of αvβ3-bound cyclic-RGDFC-GNPs. Additionally
the signal fluctuations suggest a low number of receptors give rise
to each individual spectrum. These changes in conformation and stochastic
fluctuation make it difficult to perfectly describe the protein with
a single component. However, the 30% variance captured by component
2 from the data is a significant portion and correlates with previous
studies of ligand binding.36,37

The same MCR
analysis was performed on ligand–receptor complexes
of αvβ3-bound cyclic-isoDGRFC-GNPs and CisoDGRC-GNPs,
respectively (Figure 2). Similar to cyclic-RGDFC, MCR analysis of cyclic-isoDGRFC binding
with integrin αvβ3 generated two spectral components:
component 1 is similar to the average SERS spectra of cyclic-isoDGRFC-GNPs
and component 2 still shows multiple bands associated with amino acids
(e.g., Ser, Tyr, Lys, and Trp) at the ligand-binding site of integrin
αvβ3 (Figure 2b). The MCR score plot (Figure 2a) showed that part of the data points of the αvβ3-bound
cyclic-isoDGRFC-GNPs (red dots) clustered along component 2, while
the other part of data points clustered together with the data of
cyclic-isoDGRFC-GNPs (gray dots) along component 1, suggesting these
SERS spectra arise mainly from the cyclic-isoDGRFC ligand rather than
αvβ3 receptor. This suggests the protein diffuses more
readily from the aggregated nanoparticles in the laser focus or may
have lower affinity.

Figure 2 Two-component MCR models of SERS spectra of αvβ3-bound
cyclic-isoDGRFC-GNPs (a, b) and CisoDGRC-GNPs (c, d). MCR Distribution
plots (a, c) and pure spectral components (b, d) are displayed.

The MCR results observed for the
CisoDGRC peptide were distinct
from the previous peptides. A 2-component model again accounted for
>70% of the variance, dividing the SERS data of αvβ3-bound
CisoDGRC-GNPs into two separate clusters as as shown in Figure 2c. In contrast to the previous
peptides, neither of the spectral components shows similarity to the
SERS spectra of CisoDGRC-GNPs. The two derived components show vibrational
modes attributable to Tyr, Lys, and Trp (Figure 2d). The increased variance of the SERS data
relative to the other two peptides suggests a higher level of heterogeneity
in the αvβ3-CisoDGRC-GNPs binding interaction.

A
comparison of the spectra associated with the peptide-integrin
binding from all three ligands further shows increased variance for
the αvβ3-bound CisoDGRC-GNPs. To more clearly illustrate
the observed variance, Figure 3 shows a 3-component PCA model of the spectra associated with
integrin binding. SERS data of cyclic-RGDFC and cyclic-isoDGRFC show
comparable clustering sizes while data points of CisoDGRC had a much
wider dispersion. The difference in variance suggests heterogeneity
in the receptor–ligand binding interaction. The cyclic-isoDGRFC
and cyclic-RGDFC show a single cluster, indicating a more specific
interaction; while the CisoDGRC appears to form 3 distinct clusters
suggestive of multiple different binding interactions. These differences
in binding specificity can be tested against binding affinity.

of SERS spectra of integrin αvβ3-bound
cyclic-RGDFC-GNPs (blue), cyclic-isoDGRFC-GNPs (green), and CisoDGRC-GNPs
(red).

To assess the binding dynamics,
single particle tracking experiments
using dark-field time-lapse microscopy were performed on the peptide-GNPs
interacting with αvβ3 receptors immobilized on a glass
slide. Figure 4 shows
the velocity profiles for the three peptide functionalized GNPs and
citrate capped GNPs. The velocity profiles of CisoDGRC-GNPs and citrate-GNPs
show clear “on and off” pattern binding with the immobilized
αvβ3 over the observation period, while cyclic-RGDFC-GNPs
and cyclic-isoDGRFC-GNPs show reduced velocity after a single event,
presumably binding to the αvβ3 integrin. It is noted that
interaction between a GNP and the SiO2 surface could also
result in a reduced velocity.38 The velocity
profile of a cyclic-RGDFC-GNP on a bare glass slide also showed a
similar “on and off” pattern, but stationary periods
were transient and short-lived (Figure S4). The tracking of a stationary particle exhibited a velocity of
7 ± 1 μm s–1 (Figure S4), which is significantly different than the functionalized
particle on a glass slide. This velocity for a stationary particle
correlates with mean squared displacement of 0.06 ± 0.03 μm,
which is the localization uncertainty in our system. The SPT results
suggest a stronger binding affinity between cyclic-RGDFC-GNPs and
cyclic-isoDGRFC-GNPs with the αvβ3 receptor, relative
to CisoDGRC-GNPs. The apparent irreversible binding observed likely
corresponds to an avidity effect associated with high ligand density
on the nanoparticle in combination with ligand specificity. The ligand
specificity is consistent with the SERS results.

profiles of ligand-conjugated GNPs interacting

Investigation of Peptide-GNPs
Binding with Integrin αvβ3
on the SW620 Cell Membrane
Figure 5 shows the TERS imaging results of SW620
cells incubated with cyclic-RGDFC-GNPs. As we demonstrated previously,
the interaction between a TERS tip with GNPs bound to the cell membrane
produces a significantly enhanced Raman signal.20,21 The TERS map in Figure 5a was generated using the intensity of the peak at 1002 cm–1, which reflects the distribution of cyclic-RGDFC-GNPs
in a small area (3× 3 μm2) of the cell membrane.
Due to the complexity of the cell membrane, GNPs might bind to molecules
other than integrin αvβ3 (nonspecific binding) or the
TERS tip may enhance other species, the MCR model constructed with
SERS data (Figure 1) was applied to filter the TERS spectra and generate a MCR score
map with enhanced contrast (Figure 5b). The MCR score map reduced the contrast of pixels
reflecting nonspecific binding (Figure S5) but enhanced the pixels of specific TERS signal. The pixels are
observed as a linear streak along the fast scanning direction, which
are attributed to the lower numerical aperture (NA = 0.5) objective
used in the experiments, which does not generate a pure longitudinal
mode39 and produces an asymmetric tip–nanoparticle
coupling.20 The observed pixels with reproducible
and well-resolved TERS signals (Figure 5c) are consistent with single particles bound to receptors
on flat surfaces.17,18 The observed TERS spectra are
similar to the MCR component corresponding to αvβ3 receptors
and contain vibrational bands associated with the amino acids in the
integrin RGD-ligand binding site (Figure 4d). The small shifts of these modes observed
(see Table S2 for peak assignment) are
attributed to low numbers of receptors being detected compared with
the ensemble averages and possibly to changes in the local electric
field environment arising from the TERS tip interacting with the functionalized
nanoparticle.20

intensity at 1002 cm–1 (step size: 93 nm). (b) MCR

experiments. (c) TERS spectra selected from high intensity pixels
in panel b. (d) Comparison between TERS spectrum and MCR component.
MCR is able to filter TERS data to generate much cleaner maps.

Figure 6 shows the
MCR analysis of the TERS images obtained from cyclic-isoDGRFC-GNPs
and CisoDGRC-GNPs incubated with SW620. Similar to Figure 5, the MCR models were generated
from the SERS spectra from each ligand interacting with the αvβ3
integrin. The obtained TERS spectra show similarity; however, fewer
vibrational modes are observed in the TERS relative to the SERS spectra.
This can be explained by the orientational constraint of the cell
membrane on the integrin receptor. Additional TERS mapping data of
SW620 cells incubated with the three peptide-GNPs can be found in
the Supporting Information (Figure S6).
The differences in the observed vibrational modes of the measured
TERS spectra for different peptide ligands support the hypothesis
that these peptide-GNPs have different binding conformations and orientations
with the αvβ3 integrin.

(upper
row) and CisoDGRC-GNPs (lower row) bound with sw620 cells. Left: MCR
score maps. Right: TERS spectra vs MCR components. The MCR models
were generated from the SERS spectra with the purified receptor.

Figure 7 shows analysis
of the TERS spectra (from triplicate experiments) from each of the
peptide-GNPs bound to SW620 cells. Again the spectra were analyzed
by PCA and show the same trends as were observed in the SERS data
for the purified receptor. The PCA plot of TERS spectra (Figure 7a) shows that CisoDGRC-GNPs
show greater heterogeneity than cyclic-RGDFC-GNPs and cyclic-isoDGRFC-GNPs,
represented by the larger variance in the spectra. To further quantify
these differences, the TERS spectra were further analyzed by hierarchal
cluster analysis (HCA, Figure 7b). The CisoDGRC TERS spectra show significantly larger variance
weighted distance between clusters than either of the other two peptides.
Spectral differences could arise from differences in the plasmonic
environment, such as differences in TERS tip dimension.40 To control for these plasmonic effects, the
same TERS tip was used throughout the TERS experiments for each peptide
to minimize tip-associated variance. Thus, the origin of differences
in TERS spectra for each peptide is attributable to the interaction
between the ligand functionalized nanoparticle and the integrin receptor
in the cell membrane.

Figure 7 (a) PCA and (b) HCA analysis of TERS spectra of cyclic-RGDFC-GNPs
(n = 12), cyclic-isoDGRFC-GNPs (n = 11), and CisoDGRC-GNPs (n = 15) bound with SW620
cells.

To correlate the spectral variance
observed in cells with ligand
affinity, dark-field time-lapse microscopy was performed on cells
interacting with the peptide-GNPs, allowing for the real-time tracking
of single particle dynamics on the cell membrane. Figure 8a shows an example of a nanoparticle
trajectory from a 2 min time-lapse video. Hyperspectral imaging was
used to discriminate between nanoparticles and autofluorescent organelles
(Figure S7). This allowed for the proper
identification of single nanoparticles for trajectory analysis. Nanoparticle
trajectories from the different functionalized GNPs in SW620 cell
membrane were recorded and analyzed to determine ligand-associated
changes. Multiple (7–10) trajectories were collected from GNPs
conjugated with cyclic-RGDFC, cyclic-isoDGRFC, CisoDGRC, and citrate.
The diffusion coefficient (D) for each particle in
a two-dimensional system (membrane) was determined by the following
equation:41 1  where r is the displacement
and t is the time interval describing the particle
movement between each frame. In this case, the mean square displacement
is an average of every 10 frames in a trajectory and the time interval
is 10 ms cycle time per frame. Figure S8 shows the histogram distributions of all of the calculated diffusion
coefficients. The mean diffusion coefficients showed statistical differences
(P < 0.001, one-way analysis of variance) for
different ligand-conjugated GNPs as shown in Figure 8b. CisoDGRC-GNPs and citrate-GNPs presented
higher diffusion than cyclic-RGDFC-GNPs and cyclic-isoDGRFC-GNPs in
the cell membrane. The higher diffusion coefficient of the GNPs is
interpreted to arise from a weaker drag force between the GNPs and
the SW620 cell, presumably due to the weaker binding between the peptides
and the integrin αvβ3. The SPT results on cells are consistent
with the TERS observations, indicating that, by analyzing the spectral
variance of TERS data, perspectives about relative binding affinities
between ligand-conjugated GNPs and SW620 cells can be obtained.

Conclusions
In this work, chemical information on specific
ligand–receptor
binding site of integrin αvβ3 was detected in a cancer
cell membrane by TERS microscopy. Distinct Raman signals were observed
using gold nanoparticles functionalized with three different peptide
ligands (i.e., cyclic-RGDFC, cyclic-isoDGRFC, and CisoDGRC). Variance
within the TERS spectra provides insights into chemical heterogeneity
in the binding interaction that correlates with the diffusional motion
of these particles in vitro. These results demonstrate the capability
of TERS not only to study the binding chemistry but also to provide
information about binding specificity in intact cell membranes. This
capability has the potential to improve early stage drug screening.
