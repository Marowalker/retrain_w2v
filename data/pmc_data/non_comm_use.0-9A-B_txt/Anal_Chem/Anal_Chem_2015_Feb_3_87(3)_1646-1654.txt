Multiplex
isobaric tags (e.g., tandem mass tags (TMT) and isobaric
tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)) are a valuable
tool for high-throughput mass spectrometry based quantitative proteomics.
We have developed our own multiplex isobaric tags, DiLeu, that feature
quantitative performance on par with commercial offerings but can
be readily synthesized in-house as a cost-effective alternative. In
this work, we achieve a 3-fold increase in the multiplexing capacity
of the DiLeu reagent without increasing structural complexity by exploiting
mass defects that arise from selective incorporation of 13C, 15N, and 2H stable isotopes in the reporter
group. The inclusion of eight new reporter isotopologues that differ
in mass from the existing four reporters by intervals of 6 mDa yields
a 12-plex isobaric set that preserves the synthetic simplicity and
quantitative performance of the original implementation. We show that
the new reporter variants can be baseline-resolved in high-resolution
higher-energy C-trap dissociation (HCD) spectra, and we demonstrate
accurate 12-plex quantitation of a DiLeu-labeled Saccharomyces
cerevisiae lysate digest via high-resolution nano
liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC–MS2) analysis on an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer.

==== Body
Quantitative
mass spectrometry
(MS)-based strategies featuring stable isotope labeling have become
popular in recent years for comparative studies of different biological
states. In these approaches, heavy isotopes are differentially incorporated
into a set of samples metabolically or chemically to enable relative
quantitation of the pooled samples upon MS analysis. Mass difference
labeling techniques such as metabolic stable isotope labeling by amino
acids in cell culture (SILAC),1,2 amino acid-coded tagging,3,4 mass differential tags for relative and absolute quantification
(mTRAQ),5 and reductive dimethylation6−10 introduce mass shifts for heavy-labeled peptides to allow multiplex
comparisons to be made in parallel at the MS1 level by
comparing peak intensities of heavy- and light-labeled peptides. An
inherent drawback to these methods is that increasing the number of
quantitative channels also increases mass spectral complexity, resulting
in reduced signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) and reduced instrument duty-cycle
efficiency during data-dependent acquisition which negatively impact
proteomic coverage and quantitation.11

Isobaric labeling techniques such as tandem mass tags (TMT)12,13 and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ),14 on the other hand, achieve multiplex quantitation
without increasing spectral complexity. As a result, isobaric labeling
strategies offer greater multiplexing capacity and analytical throughput
compared to mass difference labeling. In these methods, each label
in the multiplexed set is identical in mass, differing only in the
unique arrangement of isotopes distributed between the reporter and
balance groups of the chemical structure. Thus, like peptides labeled
differentially between biological samples possess the same mass and
are detected as single precursors during the MS1 scan but
yield distinct reporter ions in the low m/z region upon MS2 fragmentation. The intensities
of these reporter ions in MS2 spectra reflect the labeled
peptide’s abundance in each sample and can be compared to allow
relative quantitation. Isobaric labeling reagents are essentially
limited in their multiplexing capacity by the number of isotopic isoforms
permitted by the reporter and balance group structures. The first
generation 4-plex iTRAQ reagent was modified with a larger balancing
group in the 8-plex iTRAQ reagent to support additional isotopes and
afford additional quantitative channels.15 However, a study by Pichler et al. compared 4-plex iTRAQ, 6-plex
TMT, and 8-plex iTRAQ using a Thermo Scientific LTQ Orbitrap with
Proteome Discoverer software and revealed that the most peptides were
identified when using the smaller 4-plex iTRAQ reagents, whereas the
fewest were identified when using the large 8-plex iTRAQ reagents,
indicating that bulkier labels compromise peptide identification.16 A later study by Pottiez et al. called these
results into question through a comparison of 4-plex iTRAQ and 8-plex
iTRAQ using an AB Sciex 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF with ProteinPilot software.
They determined that 8-plex iTRAQ provided more accurate quantitation
over 4-plex iTRAQ without sacrificing protein identification rates.17 While the two studies used different instruments
and data processing software, the conflicting observations indicate
that the impact of label size on quantitative accuracy and identification
rates is uncertain and requires further investigation.

Other
efforts to increase the multiplexing capacity of quantitative
strategies have combined isobaric labeling and mass difference labeling.
One hyperplexing strategy joins triplex metabolic mass difference
labeling with 6-plex TMT labeling to achieve 18-plex quantitation,18 and with the addition of medium and heavy sets
of 6-plex TMT, 54-plex quantitation was demonstrated.19 Another approach, called combined precursor isotopic labeling
and isobaric tagging (cPILOT), uses N-terminal-specific dimethylation
at low pH followed by 6-plex TMT labeling of lysine residues at high
pH to achieve 12-plex quantitation.20

Recently, the multiplexing capacity of TMT reagents was increased
by exploiting subtle relative mass differences between 12C/13C and 14N/15N isotopes rather
than by incorporating additional isotopes.21,22 The differences in mass between elements and their isotopes, called
mass defects, arise from differences in nuclear binding energy and
vary from element to element.23 By substituting
an 15N in place of an 14N instead of a 13C in place of a 12C in the reporter group, the
resulting reporter is lighter by 6.32 mDa. This small mass difference
can be baseline-resolved at high resolution, using an Orbitrap mass
analyzer, for example, requiring a minimum MSn resolving power of 30k (at 400 m/z). With the addition of four TMT isotopologue variants, TMT reagents
are currently offered as a neutron encoded 10-plex set for use with
high-resolution MSn platforms.24 Mass defects have also been used in MS1-level multiplexed quantitative proteomics approaches such as NeuCode
SILAC,25−28 NeuCode amine-reactive labels,29 and
mass defect-based pseudoisobaric dimethyl labeling (pIDL).30

While isobaric labeling approaches have
come into favor, their
routine use for MS-based quantitative proteomics has been stifled
by their high cost. A primary contributor to the high cost is that
the complex, multistep syntheses involved in producing commercial
TMT and iTRAQ reagents lead to moderate to low yields. As the multiplexing
capacity of commercial reagents increases, so does the cost of admission
for these strategies. Currently, a TMTsixplex reagent set (Thermo
Scientific) sufficient for a single experiment (100 μg of protein
digest per channel) costs over $500, while a single-experiment TMT10plex
reagent set costs over $900. A cost-efficient solution that overcomes
this barrier to entry is beneficial to increasing the practicality
and widespread application of isobaric labeling strategies.

Previously, we described the design, synthesis, and application
of a novel 4-plex set of N,N-dimethyl
leucine (DiLeu) isobaric labeling reagents featuring reporter ions
at m/z 115, 116, 117, and 118.31 Our DiLeu reagents
show comparable protein sequence coverage and quantitative accuracy
to commercial isobaric tags with the benefit of significant cost savings
over such offerings in that they are readily synthesized at high yield
(∼80%) using commercially available isotopic reagents. Additional
benefits of the DiLeu reagent include the modest mass of the tag,
the greater intensity of generated reporter ions compared to iTRAQ
and TMT, and enhanced collision-induced MSn fragmentation of labeled peptides at reduced collision energies,
all of which can lead to increased confidence in quantitative accuracy
and peptide sequence identification.

In this work, we expand
upon the original DiLeu concept by describing
the design, synthesis, and application of a 12-plex set of DiLeu isobaric
labeling reagents made possible by subtle mass differences imparted
by mass defects between 12C/13C, 14N/15N, and 1H/2H. In this way, a
3-fold increase in multiplexing capacity has been achieved while preserving
the synthetic simplicity of the 4-plex set of reagents. The additional
neutron encoded reporter isotopologues differ in mass by intervals
of ∼6 mDa and can be resolved using high-resolution, accurate
mass instrumentation. To demonstrate the strong performance of these
reagents, we employ the Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Elite to accurately
quantify mixtures of 12-plex DiLeu-labeled Saccharomyces
cerevisiae tryptic peptides via high-resolution liquid
chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS2).

Methods

All isotopic reagents used for the synthesis
of labels were purchased from Isotec (Miamisburg, OH). Mass spec grade
trypsin/Lys C mix and dithiothreitol (DTT) were purchased from Promega
(Madison, WI). Urea, ammonium bicarbonate, ACS grade methanol (MeOH),
ACS grade dichloromethane (DCM), ACS grade acetonitrile (ACN), Optima
UPLC grade ACN, Optima UPLC grade water, and Optima LC/MS grade formic
acid were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Sodium

(DMTMM), N-methylmorpholine (NMM), heptafluorobutyric
acid (HFBA), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and bovine serum albumin (BSA)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Hydroxylamine solution
was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA).

Synthesis of DiLeu Reporter
Detailed syntheses can
be found in the Supporting Information (Scheme
S-1). l-Leucine or isotopic l-leucine (l-leucine-1-13C,15N, l-leucine-3-13C,15N, or l-leucine-1,2-13C) and sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN) or sodium cyanoborodeuteride
(NaBD3CN) (2.5× molar excess to leucine) were suspended
in H2O or D2O, and the mixture was cooled in
an ice–water bath. Formaldehyde (CH2O, 37% w/w)
or isotopic formaldehyde (CD2O or 13CH2O, 20% w/w) (2.5× molar excess to leucine) was added dropwise,
and the mixture was stirred in an ice–water bath for 30 min.
The target product was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH/DCM)
and dried in vacuo.

18O Exchange
Each isotopologue
of reporter
115 and 116 requires 18O exchange prior to reductive dimethylation. l-Leucine or isotopic l-leucine was dissolved in 1
N HCl H218O solution (pH 1) and stirred on a
hot plate at 65 °C for 4 h. Following evaporation of HCl from
the solution in vacuo, trace amounts of acid were removed with StratoSpheres
PL-HCO3 MP resin (Agilent Technologies) to obtain 18O l-leucine in free base form.

Activation
of DiLeu
DiLeu reporter in anhydrous DMF
was combined with DMTMM and NMM at 0.9× molar ratios to DiLeu
reporter and vortexed at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture
was centrifuged at 14 000g for 1 min, and
the supernatant was used immediately for peptide labeling.

Yeast
Lysate Enzymatic Digestion
S.
cerevisiae lysate was provided by Promega (Madison,
WI). Proteins were digested with trypsin/Lys C mix (Promega) according
the manufacturers protocol and desalted using a SepPak C18 SPE cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA). Digested peptides were divided
into 12 equal aliquots (in triplicate), dried in vacuo, and dissolved
in 60:40 ACN/0.5 M TEAB pH 8.5 prior to labeling.

Protein Digest
Labeling
12-Plex DiLeu labeling was
performed in triplicate by addition of labeling solution at a 20:1
label to peptide digest ratio by weight and vortexing at room temperature
for 2 h. The labeling reaction was quenched by addition of hydroxylamine
to a concentration of 0.25%, and the labeled peptide samples were
dried in vacuo. Labeled peptide samples were then dissolved in 30:70
ACN/H2O, combined in 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 or 16:8:4:2:1:10:10:1:2:4:8:16
ratios, and dried in vacuo. For the multiplexing comparison, labeled
peptide samples were combined in 10:1 ratios as 4-plex, 8-plex, and
12-plex mixtures. The combined samples were then acidified with HFBA
to a concentration of 0.5%, cleaned with Omix SCX pipet tips (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) or SCX SpinTips (Protea Biosciences,
Morgantown, WV), and desalted with Omix C18 pipet tips (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA).

LC–MS2
Samples
were analyzed using
a Waters nanoAcquity UPLC system (Milford, MA) coupled to a Thermo
Scientific Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA). Labeled
tryptic peptide samples were dried in vacuo and dissolved in 3% ACN,
0.1% formic acid in water. Peptides were loaded onto a 75 μm
inner diameter microcapillary column fabricated with an integrated
emitter tip and packed with 15 cm of Bridged Ethylene Hybrid C18 particles
(1.7 μm, 130 Å, Waters). Mobile phase A was composed of
water, 5% DMSO, and 0.1% formic acid. Mobile phase B was composed
of ACN, 5% DMSO, and 0.1% formic acid. Separation was performed using
a gradient elution of 5% to 35% mobile phase B over 120 min at a flow
rate of 300 nL/min. Survey scans of peptide precursors from 380 to
1600 m/z were performed at a resolving
power of 120k (at 400 m/z) with
an AGC target of 5 × 105 and maximum injection time
of 150 ms. The top 10 precursors were then selected for higher-energy
C-trap dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (HCD MS2)
analysis with an isolation width of 2.0 Da, a normalized collision
energy (NCE) of 27, a resolving power of 60k, an AGC target of 3 ×
104, a maximum injection time of 250 ms, and a lower mass
limit of 110 m/z. Precursors were
subject to dynamic exclusion for 15 s with a 10 ppm tolerance.

Data Analysis
Mass spectra were processed using Proteome
Discoverer (version 1.4.0.288, Thermo Scientific). Raw files were
searched in Proteome Discover against UniProt S. cerevisiae complete database (September, 2013) using Sequest HT algorithm with
trypsin selected as the enzyme and two missed cleavages allowed. Searches
were performed with a precursor mass tolerance of 25 ppm and a fragment
mass tolerance of 0.03 Da. Static modifications consisted of DiLeu
labels on peptide N-termini (+145.12801 Da) and carbamidomethylation
of cysteine residues (+57.02146 Da). Dynamic modifications consisted
of DiLeu labels on lysine residues, oxidation of methionine residues
(+15.99492 Da), deamidation of asparagine and glutamine residues (+0.98402
Da), and methylation of C termini and aspartic acid, glutamic acid,
histidine, lysine, arginine, serine, and threonine residues (+14.01565
Da). Peptide spectral matches (PSMs) were validated based on q-values to 1% FDR (false discovery rate) using percolator.
Quantitation was performed in Proteome Discoverer with a reporter
ion integration tolerance of 20 ppm for the most confident centroid.
Only the PSMs that contained all 12 reporter ions were considered,
and protein quantitative ratios were determined using a minimum of
one quantified peptide. Reporter ion ratio values for protein groups
were exported to Excel workbook format. Isotopic interference correction
factors (Supporting Information) were calculated
using PTC Mathcad 14 (Needham, MA) and applied in Microsoft Excel
(Redmond, CA).

Results and Discussion
The structure
of the DiLeu isobaric labeling reagent follows that
of other isobaric reagents in that it is composed of a reporter group,
a balance group, and an amine-reactive group: an N,N-dimethylated leucine makes up the reporter and
the balance groups, and a triazine ester amine-reactive moiety enables
selective modification of peptide N-termini and lysine side chains
(Figure 1A). The inspiration for using dimethylated
leucine as a reporter group began with our previous observation that
MS2 fragmentation of dimethylated peptides containing N-terminal
leucine yielded the most intense immonium a1 ions compared
to other N-terminal amino acids. N-terminal dimethylation also provides
the added benefit of enhancing peptide fragmentation and aiding in
de novo sequencing,32,33 and the compact size of dimethylated
leucine results in a modest nominal mass addition to the peptide of
145 Da per label (Supporting Information Figure S-1). Consequently, the optimal collision energy required
to produce both abundant reporter ions and a wealth of peptide backbone
fragment ions during collision-induced MSn fragmentation of labeled peptides is lower than that which is required
for unlabeled peptides.34 This is in contrast
to TMT-labeled peptides, which require higher collision energy to
yield adequate reporter ion and peptide backbone fragment signals
compared to unlabeled peptides.35 While
the DiLeu reagents incorporate deuteriums into the reporter group,
DiLeu-labeled peptides do not suffer from significant shifts in LC
retention time between the labels.31 By
grouping the deuteriums around the polar dimethylated amine functional
group, the probability of their interaction with reversed-phase stationary
phase is low—as opposed to the strongly favored interaction
of the hydrophobic leucine side chain with the stationary phase—and
the deuterium effect is minimized, in agreement with previous research.36 The triazine ester was chosen as the amine-reactive
group because it activates quickly (within 1 h), does not require
purification prior to labeling, and labels amines with high efficiency.

Figure 1 The 12-plex
DiLeu general structure. (A) The DiLeu isobaric labeling
reagent consists of a reporter group, balance group, and amine-reactive
triazine ester group. Stars indicate positions of isotopic substitution.
(B) Stable isotopes (13C, 2H, and 15N) incorporated into the reporter group are mass-balanced by stable
isotopes (13C, 18O) in the carbonyl balance
group. Unique combinations of isotopes incorporated into the reporter
group yield two 115 variants, three 116 variants, three 117 variants,
and four 118 variants whose isotopologues differ in mass by approximately
6 mDa.

DiLeu reagents are synthesized
in high yield (∼80%) in only
a few steps using established and relatively simple chemistry. Reductive
formaldehyde dimethylation of leucine followed by activation with
DMTMM yields half of the isobaric set, while the other half requires
an initial 18O exchange of leucine prior to dimethylation.
All isotopic reagents and chemicals are commercially available, making
the synthesis of DiLeu accessible to any lab and scalable to the needs
of any experiment. Dimethyl leucines can be stored for several years
prior to activation, but labeling should be carried out soon after
activation for optimal labeling efficiency. A typical complex tryptic
digest sample can be labeled completely within 1–2 h, making
same day activation and labeling convenient.

The first generation
of DiLeu reagents was originally developed
as a 4-plex set featuring reporter ions spaced one Da apart at m/z 115, 116, 117, and 118. Isotopic substitutions
of 1H/2H and 14N/15N in
the reporter group are offset by 12C/13C and 16O/18O in the carbonyl balance group to create
isobaric structures. Because the carbonyl balance group offers only
two isotopic substitution positions with four possible isotopic variants
(12C=16O, 12C=18O, 13C=16O, and 13C=18O), the number of isobaric structures giving
rise to reporters spaced by a single Da is limited to four.

It was demonstrated recently with the TMT reagents that additional
isotopologues could be created by incorporation of 15N
instead of 13C in the reporter groups. In doing so, the
two reporter ions differ by 6.32 mDa, which can be baseline-resolved
using high-resolution MSn acquisition.21,22 Given the similarities between TMT and DiLeu reagents, it stood
to reason that additional DiLeu reporters could be developed in a
similar manner using alternative combinations of 12C/13C, 14N/15N, and 1H/2H. Through calculated substitution of these isotopes in the
DiLeu reporter structure, we designed eight new reporter isotopologues
with unique “pseudoisobaric” masses differing from the
original four by intervals of 5.84 mDa or 6.32 mDa to bring the total
number of reporters to 12 (Figure 2). The resulting
12-plex set of isobaric DiLeu reagents is composed of two 115 variants,
three 116 variants, three 117 variants, and four 118 variants (Figure 1B). In designing the new reporters, no synthetic
steps were added, and no custom isotopic reagents were needed.

Figure 2 The 12-plex
DiLeu reporter ion structures showing stable isotope
positions.

In order to determine the resolving
power at which the 12 reporter
ions could be baseline-resolved, we combined each of the 12 reporters
at equal concentrations and infused the mixture into an Orbitrap Elite
mass spectrometer using HCD MS2 acquisition in the Orbitrap
at resolving powers ranging from 15k to 240k (at m/z 400) (Figure 3). At a
resolving power of 15k, the separation between neighboring reporter
variants is insufficient for accurate intensity measurements for quantitation.
At a resolving power of 30k, reporters are baseline-resolved into
unique peaks that are suitable for accurate quantitation. At a resolving
power of 60k and greater, the −1 isotopic peaks from channels
116c, 117b, 117c, 118b, and 118c are also baseline-resolved between
the surrounding reporters. Because these resolved isotopic peaks no
longer interfere with the surrounding primary reporter ion peaks at
60k resolving power, the most accurate quantitation can be achieved
at this resolution following isotopic interference correction.

Figure 3 The 12-plex
DiLeu reporter ion peaks. The 12-plex reporters were
mixed in a 1:1 ratio and infused directly into the Orbitrap Elite
mass spectrometer, subjected to HCD MS2 fragmentation,
and acquired at resolving powers 15–240k.

As is common with all stable isotope labeling reagents, the
purities
of the isotopes incorporated into the DiLeu reporter groups are not
100%. This is because the isotopic starting reagents used in the reporter
syntheses contain stable isotopes in 98–99% purities. As a
result, each primary DiLeu reporter ion peak is accompanied by low-intensity
isotopic impurity peaks that are greater or lesser in mass by one
neutron. For each type of stable isotope (13C, 15N, 2H) incorporated into the reporter group, a discrete
−1 isotopic peak is observed. For example, the 118b reporter
(m/z 118.14067), which contains 13C, 15N, and 2H, has three −1
isotope peaks at m/z 117.13494 (2H → 1H), 117.13786 (13C → 12C), and 117.14363 (15N → 14N).
The fractional intensities of each channel’s primary reporter
ion peak and isotopic peaks were determined at resolving powers of
30k and 60k via independent LC–MS2 analysis of BSA
tryptic digest labeled separately with each of the 12-plex DiLeu reagents.
The fractional intensities of each of the 12-plex DiLeu primary reporter
ion peaks and isotopic peaks are shown as percentages of the combined
intensity in Table S-1 (Supporting Information), and the interferences of isotopic peaks to neighboring primary
reporter ion peaks are shown in Table S-2 (Supporting
Information). At a resolving power of 30k, the exact interferences
of the unresolved −1 isotopic peaks from channels 117b, 117c,
118b, and 118c to the surrounding reporter ion
peaks are difficult to ascertain (Figure S-2, Supporting Information). Still, applying isotopic interference
correction to data acquired at 30k resolving power is recommended
with the understanding that quantitative accuracy will be lower for
channels 116a–c and 117a–c than if the data had been
acquired at 60k resolving power due to additional interference by
unresolved isotopic peaks.

If an experiment does not require
the full multiplexing capacity,
a reduction in multiplexing allows acquisition at lower resolving
power. Omitting the 117 channels eliminates the ambiguous isotopic
interferences at 30k resolving power and allows 9-plex quantitation
at a faster acquisition speed. Using only the 115 and 118 channels
enables 6-plex quantitation at 30k resolving power and obviates the
need for any isotopic interference correction. Selecting channels
115a, 116a, 116c, 117a, 117c, 118a, and 118c results in 12.16 mDa
spacing between reporter isotopologues that can be baseline-resolved
at 15k resolving power, permitting 7-plex quantitation at even shorter
Orbitrap transient times or with a moderate resolving power quadrupole
time-of-flight (QTOF) instrument.

Next, we aimed to demonstrate
the quantitative precision, accuracy,
and dynamic range of the 12-plex DiLeu reagents for bottom-up protein
quantitation by labeling a complex mixture of S. cerevisiae lysate tryptic peptides and analyzing by high-resolution LC–MS2. Yeast lysate was digested with trypsin/Lys C, desalted,
split into equal aliquots, and labeled in triplicate with each of
the 12 DiLeu reagents. The 12-plex DiLeu-labeled yeast peptide samples
were then prepared by combining at 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 and 16:8:4:2:1:10:10:1:2:4:8:16
ratios (115a–118d). Samples were acquired on the Orbitrap Elite
using a data-dependent top 10 method with HCD MS2 acquisition
at a resolving power of 60k. While 30k resolving power is sufficient
for baseline separation of the reporters, 60k resolving power was
chosen for this experiment because it further resolves several interfering
isotopic peaks from the surrounding reporters and allows for more
accurate isotopic interference correction. Data from the triplicate
LC–MS2 runs were combined in Proteome Discover to
calculate reporter ion ratios for 663 and 712 identified protein groups
from the 1:1 and 16:1 samples, respectively. After isotopic interference corrections were applied in Excel (Figure S-1 in the Supporting Information), the 12-plex DiLeu ratios
for all quantified proteins were plotted against each other (Figure 4). Across all channels, the median ratios measure
within 10% of the expected values with average coefficients of variation
(CVs) of 7.9% for the 1:1 ratio sample and 11.5% for the 16:1 ratio
sample. Reproducibility and variance of the protein quantitative ratios
between 16:1 replicates were compared and showed excellent correlation
with each other (Figure 5). To also characterize
the quantitative performance across the measured peptide dynamic range
within a sample, reporter ion ratios of PSMs were plotted as a function
of precursor ion signal intensity for a 12-plex DiLeu-labeled yeast
lysate digest sample labeled in 10:1 ratios between neighboring channels
(Figure S-3 in the Supporting Information). Variability of reporter ion ratios was fairly consistent across
the 5 orders of magnitude of precursor intensity. These results show
that the overall accuracy and precision remains excellent for highly
multiplexed, complex proteomics experiments across a usable dynamic
range. Furthermore, the increase in multiplexing also does not negatively
impact peptide backbone fragmentation. An example HCD MS2 spectrum of a yeast lysate peptide yielding high coverage of b-
and y-ions is shown (Figure 6).

Figure 4 Quantitative performance.
The 12-plex DiLeu-labeled yeast digest
samples were combined in 1:1 ratios across all channels and in 16:8:4:2:1:10:10:1:2:4:8:16
ratios (115a–118d) and analyzed by LC–MS2 at 60k resolving power. Measured quantitative ratios of identified
proteins (box and whiskers) are shown for (A) the 1:1 mixture in relation
to neighboring channels and (B) the 16:1 mixture in relation to 16×
channels (115a and 118d). Box plots demarcate the median (line), the
25th and 75th percentile (box), and the 5th and 95th percentile (whiskers).

Figure 5 Replicate variance and reproducibility. Measured
quantitative ratios
of identified proteins shared between three technical replicates of
the 16:1 sample were plotted against each other. Log2 ratios
between replicates closely track the y = x function and show excellent correlation across the 16-fold
dynamic range.

Figure 6 An MS2 spectrum
of a 12-plex DiLeu-labeled yeast tryptic
peptide acquired in the Orbitrap at 60k resolving power following
HCD fragmentation (NCE 29). DiLeu reporter ion signals (1:1 ratio)
are fully resolved in the low-mass range, and a wealth of b- and y-ions
are observed for confident peptide sequence identification.

We also explored the effect of
multiplexing on peptide and protein
identification and quantitative precision. Three DiLeu-labeled yeast
peptide samples were prepared: (1) a 4-plex mixture of 115b, 116a,
117c, and 118d combined at a 10:1:10:1 ratio; (2) an 8-plex mixture
of 115a, 115b, 116b, 116c, 117a, 117b, 118c, and 118d combined at
a 10:1:10:1:10:1:10:1 ratio; (3) a 12-plex mixture of 115a through
118d combined at a 10:1:10:1:10:1:10:1:10:1:10:1 ratio. The 4-plex
sample contained channels separated by 1 Da while the 8-plex contains
four pairs of channels separated by ∼6 mDa, providing a good
indication of the impact of increasing the multiplexing with closely
spaced reporter isotopologues. Peptide concentration and injection
volume were equal across the three samples. Overall on-column sample
load was greater than that used for the 1:1 and 16:1 experiments.
Samples were acquired in triplicate on the Orbitrap Elite using a
data-dependent top 10 method with HCD MS2 acquisition at
a resolving power of 60k (at 400 m/z). We chose to keep the resolving power and acquisition speed constant
for all three experiments in order to evaluate only the effect of
increasing multiplexing with closely spaced reporters on identification
rates and quantitative precision. As such, the 4-plex experiment is
limited by the slower MS2 acquisition speed at 60k resolving
power. In practice, a typical 4-plex experiment with 1 Da-spaced reporters
would be acquired at the lowest MS2 resolution to achieve
the fastest acquisition speed, yielding significantly more MS2 spectra and greater numbers of identified PSMs, peptides,
and proteins than we observe in this comparison. Across triplicate
runs, the 4-, 8-, and 12-plex experiments resulted in 1116, 1008,
and 985 identified protein groups, respectively, and 5451, 4874, and
4437 identified peptides, respectively. This represents a 12% reduction
in protein identification rate and a 19% reduction in peptide identification
for the 12-plex experiment. The reporter ratios of quantified proteins
from neighboring 10:1 channels were then plotted against each other
(Figure 7). The 8-plex and 12-plex distributions
are broader than the 4-plex distributions, and median values deviate
by varying degrees from the expected value. Average CVs for the protein
ratios of the 4-, 8-, and 12-plex were 9.9%, 16.2%, and 14.2%, respectively;
average CVs for PSM reporter ion ratios were 18.7%, 31.6%, and 28.0%,
respectively. While the reductions in protein and peptide identification
rate and in quantitative accuracy and precision are not insignificant,
we feel that these concessions are acceptable given the increase in
analytical throughput.

Figure 7 Multiplexing comparison.
DiLeu-labeled yeast lysate digest samples
were prepared as 4-, 8-, and 12-plex mixtures in 10:1 ratios between
neighboring channels and analyzed by LC–MS2 at 60k
resolving power. Measured quantitative ratios of identified proteins
(box and whiskers) are shown. Box plots demarcate the median (line),
the 25th and 75th percentile (box), and the 5th and 95th percentile
(whiskers).

A similar decrease in
quantitation precision resulting from an
increase in the number of quantitative channels was observed for TMT
by McAlister et al.22 They reasoned that,
since bond energetics are constant regardless of the number of channels,
the overall population of reporter ions produced during fragmentation
is finite. Thus, increasing the number of channels reduces the population
of reporter ions per channel, and the distribution of reporter ion
ratios broadens. They determined that increasing the injection time
in proportion to the decrease in ion population could compensate for
this effect; when ion populations were equal between lower and higher
multiplexed experiments, the distributions of reporter ratios were
in close agreement. We anticipate that a similar tuning of injection
times could have the same impact upon DiLeu quantitative precision
when comparing differently multiplexed samples.

It has been
shown that isobaric labeling strategies suffer from
reporter ion ratio distortion for complex protein digest samples.37−39 The cause of this effect is coisolation of interfering near-isobaric
ions along with the target precursor ion during MS2 fragmentation.
One approach solves this problem by performing an MS3 isolation
and fragmentation event on the highest intensity fragment or fragments
from the MS2 scan and using MS3 reporter ion
ratios for quantitation.40,41 While MS2 analysis was sufficient to benchmark the quantitative performance
of 12-plex DiLeu using known samples, the MS3 quantitation
strategy can be employed to overcome ratio distortion when quantifying
unknown complex protein digest mixtures.

A recently discovered
caveat to 10-plex TMT quantitation of complex
samples is that the ∼6 mDa spaced reporter ions become prone
to coalescence into a single peak at high abundance in Orbitrap mass
analyzers, and this coalescence has an adverse effect on reporter
ion quantitation.42 On the Q-Exactive,
it was determined that decreasing the MS2 AGC target value
from 1 × 106 to 2 × 105 eliminated
the problem entirely without impairing protein identification or quantitation.
Because the tendency to coalesce decreases as field strength increases,43 the Orbitrap Elite was found to be far less
susceptible even at high AGC target values.42,44 At the MS2 AGC target setting of 3 × 104 used in our experiments, we did not observe coalescence of the 12-plex
DiLeu reporter ions.

Another limitation of current multiplexed
isobaric labeling strategies
is the high cost of entry. Broad quantitative analyses of many biological
states over several time points supported by an adequate number of
biological or technical replicates can quickly become financially
impractical. Likewise, experiments that require labeling large amounts
of sample material necessitate expensive bulk orders of labeling reagent.
In some cases, the laboratory may need to make sacrifices by adjusting
research goals, reducing scale, or preparing fewer replicates in order
to stay within budget. In developing the DiLeu reagents and extending
them to the high-resolution enabled 12-plex set, cost-effectiveness
has been of paramount concern. On a per-experiment basis, we calculate
that for a labeling of 100 μg of protein digest per channel,
a 12-plex DiLeu labeling costs under $23. An 8-plex DiLeu labeling
costs under $12 by omitting the four most expensive labels, and a
4-plex DiLeu labeling costs under $5 by using the original 1 Da spaced
labels. The reagents needed to synthesize the original 4-plex DiLeu
set (115a, 116c, 117b, 118d) can be purchased at the present time
for under $1500 and provide enough material to synthesize at least
200 mg of each channel, which is sufficient for 200 labeling experiments
of 100 μg of protein digest. Reagents sufficient for synthesis
of the 12-plex set, which adds two isotopic leucines and another isotopic
version of formaldehyde, can be purchased for just over 3 times the
cost of the 4-plex. A lab with basic knowledge of simple organic chemistry
techniques can synthesize DiLeu reagents in house to significantly
reduce the financial burden of large-scale quantitative experiments
that would otherwise be unfeasible given the high cost of commercial
isobaric labeling kits.

Conclusions
We have increased the
multiplexing capacity of our original DiLeu
isobaric labeling reagents from 4-plex to 12-plex through calculated
incorporation of 12C/13C, 14N/15N, and 1H/2H stable isotopes in the
reporter groups, without any other alterations to the original DiLeu
structure. The additional reporter isotopologues were synthesized
in house using commercially available, noncustom stable isotopic reagents.
By retaining the original structure, several benefits remain. First,
synthesis of each of the 12-plex DiLeu reporters is accomplished at
high yield in only two or three steps using established and simple
chemical reactions. Second, the dimethylated leucine label adds a
modest amount of mass to labeled peptides and does not produce abnormal
cleavages or interfering fragmentation artifacts in MS2 spectra that can negatively impact peptide sequence identification.
Rather, the dimethylated leucine label enhances electrospray ionization
by increasing hydrophobicity and promotes native fragmentation pathways
by increasing proton affinity at N-termini and lysine side chains,
which can improve peptide sequence identification.45 Third, the isotope-encoded dimethylated leucine reporters
are as stable as their leucine counterparts, allowing storage for
several years prior to activation. Finally, the high labeling efficiency
of the DiLeu reagent allows complete peptide N-terminus and lysine
side chain labeling of complex protein digest samples within 1–2
h.

The small mass difference of ∼6 mDa separating the
115,
116, 117, and 118 variants of the 12-plex DiLeu reporters can be baseline-resolved
for accurate quantitation at an MSn resolving
power of 30k (at 400 m/z), which
is achievable on Orbitrap, FTICR, and some QTOF instruments. Acquiring
at a resolving power of 60k baseline resolves isotopic peaks and allows
more accurate isotopic interference correction at full multiplexing
capacity. Reduced multiplexing configurations allow highly accurate
9-plex and 7-plex quantitation at resolving powers of 30k and 15k,
respectively. We employed the Orbitrap Elite for high-resolution LC–MS2 analysis of 12-plex DiLeu-labeled yeast lysate digests combined
at known concentrations and observed close agreement to the expected
protein ratios at high precision with good reproducibility across
a 16:1 dynamic range. Increasing the number of quantitative channels
to 12 maintains quantitative performance while yielding only a modest
decrease in protein and peptide identification rates.

The 12-plex
DiLeu reagent set represents the highest multiplexing
capacity currently available in an isobaric labeling experiment, enabling
for the first time triplicate analysis of four samples in a single
experiment without increasing mass spectral complexity. In the future,
it is possible to further expand the multiplexing capacity of the
DiLeu reagent with the inclusion of ∼3 mDa spaced reporter
isotopologues to enable 21-plex quantitation at a resolving power
of 60k (at m/z 400). The mainstream
use of Orbitrap instrumentation has made high-resolution, accurate
mass analysis an accessible new standard for most researchers. The
Orbitrap Fusion and Q Exactive HF mass spectrometers, featuring ultrahigh-field
Orbitrap mass analyzers that nearly double acquisition speeds compared
to their predecessors, make comprehensive analysis and high-resolution
enabled quantitation of complex samples even more practical. We conclude
that the quantitative performance, affordability, and expansive multiplexing
capability of the 12-plex DiLeu reagents establish them as a powerful
tool for large-scale, high-throughput quantitative proteomics studies
and make them an attractive alternative to current commercial options.
