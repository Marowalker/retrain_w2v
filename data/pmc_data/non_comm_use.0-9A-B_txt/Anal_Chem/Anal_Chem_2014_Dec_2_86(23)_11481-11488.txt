The purification and sorting of cells
using microfluidic methodologies has been a remarkably active area
of research over the past decade. Much of the scientific and technological
work associated with microfluidic cell separation has been driven
by needs in clinical diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring, most
notably in the context of circulating tumor cells. The last several
years have seen advances in a broad range of separation modalities
ranging from miniaturized analogs of established techniques such as
fluorescence- and magnetic-activated cell sorting (FACS and MACS, respectively),
to more specialized approaches based on affinity, dielectrophoretic
mobility, and inertial properties of cells. With several of these
technologies nearing commercialization, there is a sense that the
field of microfluidic cell separation has achieved a high level of
maturity over an unusually short span of time. In this Perspective,
we set the stage by describing major scientific and technological
advances in this field and ask what the future holds. While many scientific
questions remain unanswered and new compelling questions will undoubtedly
arise, the relative maturity of this field poses some unique challenges.

==== Body
The history of mammalian cell
separation dates back to the 1960s, when parameters that could be
exploited for target cell isolation were beginning to emerge. In 1968,
Böyum published his seminal paper on Ficoll-density gradients
for the isolation of lymphocytes from whole blood based on density
differences among blood cell populations.1 The 1970s saw a rapid advance in cell separation techniques, spawning
a new preprocess step for cell analyses. Panning techniques2 and rosette-based3 platforms further increased efficiencies of blood separation. Herzenberg
and co-workers in 19724 introduced a fluorescent-based
separation method known as fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).
In FACS, the cells are segregated on the basis of their unique membrane
or intracellular protein expression patterns, via tagging through
the cell receptor and fluorescent ligand interactions. Later, Rembaum
and co-workers (1977)5 developed an immunomagnetic
technique, now known as magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS), based
on specific labeling of cells with magnetic beads for separation.
Although some of the old techniques are becoming obsolete, most of
these traditional separation techniques remain standard practice in
the laboratory. However, the more bulk-like separations, larger benchtop
instruments, do not address many of the current questions in biological
or clinical research due to a lack of limited sample handling capability
and low target cell concentrations on one hand and the need for higher
throughput analyses on the other. Many of today’s state-of-the-art
separation tools have throughputs in 105–107 cells per hour and fail to isolate cells with high purity
and recover rare cell populations (<1% of the total cell content).
Today, FACS and MACS remain the most widely utilized methods, but
limited sample amounts coupled with requirements of high sensitivity
have spawned the development of a broad range of microfluidic cell
separation methods. With the vast number of diagnostic and analytical
tests now available, samples need to be divided among platforms and
today’s separation platforms need to adapt to an ever-smaller
sample amount. We realize that in some cases larger volumes are required
due to sampling statistics but, overall, microfluidics has proven
to be the next step in the separation of small volumes.

The
distant origins of microfluidics lie in the field of analytical chemistry6 (gas-phase chromatography, high-pressure liquid
chromatography, and capillary electrophoresis) and today see applications
in physics, chemistry, biology, and energy. Specifically, the microscale
laminar flow in these platforms has allowed for significant advances
in controlled cellular manipulation; to date, over 3500 research papers
in microfluidic cell separation have been published.7 Microfluidic isolation can be generally divided into two
broad categories of enrichment modalities, either isolation based
on the cell physical characteristics (e.g., size and density) or cell
biochemistry (e.g., antigen expressions).8 The evolution of physical and biological separation has been well
described in several recent review articles.9−13 As illustrated in Table 1,
there are several microfluidic devices that have been developed for
separation based on cell size, shape, and density, including inertial
microfluidics14 and deterministic lateral
displacement.15 Microfluidic techniques
such as optical force separation, dielectrophoresis, and acoustophoresis
probe physical properties like refractive index, dielectric properties,
and compressibility, respectively.10,11,16 Conversely, biochemical or affinity-based isolation
platforms generally take advantage of unique antigen expression patterns
on cells to effectively separate.12,16,17 It is well-known that cell populations each have
a unique “fingerprint” that can be essentially used
as a way to identify it within a heterogeneous suspension. Techniques
like FACS and MACS label cells with either fluorescent or magnet tags,
respectively, to allow for separation. Adhesion-based techniques use
the advantageous surface-to-volume ratios of microfluidics to adhere
cells, via the same antibody–antigen links as FACS and MACS,
within the channel.18 More details on these
techniques will be covered in the next section, but it is clear that
researchers now have several tailored tools and methods to separate
a desired cell population.

In our view, the first application
in which microfluidics has and will make a large impact will be as
a preprocessing step in the workflow of numerous biological assays.
Proteomics,19 genomics,19,20 tissue engineering,21 and induced pluripotent
stem cell research22 are adopting microfluidics
as a means of isolating and probing key rare cell populations. As
microfluidic cell separation continues to illustrate its utility,
application areas are predicted to continue to grow in both number
and complexity. In the next five years, as the efficiencies of microfluidic
cell separation devices with biologically relevant samples (e.g.,
blood, lymphatic tissue, tissue digestates) increase, whole cell diagnostics
and therapeutic monitoring will start to emerge in the clinic. On
the other hand, in ten years, with higher purity separations in microfluidic
devices, the availability of adult stem cells for regenerative medicine
and autologous stem cell transplants will likely increase. Finally,
20 years from now, we predict that home-based therapeutic monitoring
and diagnostics will become a reality as packaging and miniaturization
of these technologies improves.

The remainder of this Perspective
article discusses how emerging approaches will enable more application-specific
isolation methods. Below, we briefly survey the relatively large range
of current microfluidic cell separation technologies to illustrate
that there is no “one size fits all” isolation method
and that microfluidic platforms need be tailored to companion techniques
and sample types. We also discuss prospects of commercializing microfluidic
cell separators and discuss future opportunities as well as challenges.

Advantages
and Limitations of the Current State of the Art
As introduced
previously, cell isolation in microfluidics is generally confined
to either technologies based on physical differences or biochemical
differences in a heterogeneous cell suspension. Each specific modality
has characteristic advantages and shortcomings as outlined in Table 1. Although no specific standard has been established
to define a “good” microfluidic separation platform,
the best microfluidic devices to date have illustrated high recovery
of the target cells while minimizing nontarget, or interference, cells
form the collected stream. We have broadly characterized these metrics
via qualitative metrics, rather than quantitative evaluation. For
a more quantitative assessment, there are a number of excellent reviews
on microfluidic cell separation that provide examples of high recovery
and high purity platforms.10−12,16,18 Another metric that is important, especially
in cases of larger volume samples, is the ability to maintain a high
throughput, thus reducing the time necessary for the isolation. Microfluidic
devices, based on their inherent micrometer dimension, have very low
overall volumes (nL−μL) and thus require high throughputs
in order to process high volume samples. This fact is most evident
for rare cells, where samples like blood with >109 cells
per mL need to handle several milliliters of concentrated samples
in a minimal time. Much of the current literature in rare cell handling,
particularly in circulating tumor cells (CTCs), has illustrated >100
μL/min flow rate (108–1010 cells/h)
throughputs, and thus, milliliter handling is no longer a constraint
in rare cells. That being said, there are several approaches (adhesion-based,
dielectrophoresis, optical/FACS) that have inherently low ceilings
with respect to throughputs based on fundamental limits imposed by
the either the chemistry and/or physics of the platform. As noted
in Table 1, the approaches that have the high
throughputs are MACS and many of the physical isolators, with trade-offs
in other metrics. As introduced in Table 1, the weight of the
advantage and limitations results in specific modalities of isolation
being suited for key application types. As an example, the attachment
of magnetic beads to the target cells of interest is not a disadvantage
in diagnostics, but it is a potential barrier in regenerative medicine.
Separations based on physical features, such as size, density or,
dielectric properties, are universally limited by the need for the
target cells to possess a distinguishing parameter versus background,
nontarget cells. For example, diluted whole blood is an excellent
candidate for most size-based microfluidic separation of red blood
cells from nonred blood cells, as the erythrocytes have unique shape
and size,23 but to separate rare cell types
within the nonred blood cell population, no passive technique is a
viable methodology, as there is almost always an overlap in the characteristic
size, shape, dielectric properties, or compressibility of the white
blood cells and the rare target cells. Due to the crowding and elastic
collisions in dense biological samples like blood, 5–100×
dilutions are generally needed to accomplish efficient separation
metrics; the one exception is the separation of blood based on the
natural tendencies of red blood cells to marginate from white blood
cells in microchannels.24 Davis et al.
noted that with whole blood in deterministic lateral displacement
there is hydrodynamic coupling of the cells to each other, entrapping
a small cell in a larger cell’s flow field and preventing separation
of the small one from the large one and entropic effects by which
larger cells are moved by depletion forces to the outside of a channel.23 In cases where the target cell can be individually
selected on the basis of size, density, shape, or other physical parameter,
these platforms are preferred where high purity is desired.11,25 Due to the variability in cell characteristics and limitations on
separation resolution, i.e., the smallest difference in parameters
possible to isolate the cell, efficiencies are generally less than
90%,26 defined as the number of target
cells captured over the total target cell number in the cell suspension.
These platforms are also label-free and tend to provide higher throughput
enrichments (>108 cells/h).11 There are numerous examples of physical-based cell separation platforms
that illustrate poor purities, but we believe that the technique of
physical isolation works well to achieve high purity purification.27−29 However, the application (and selection of parameters) of a physical
constrained enrichment is very often poorly implemented. There are
have been many reports of size-based separation of CTCs from whole
blood, but it has been well noted that several CTCs are of similar
diameter to white blood cells, thus raising the issue of false estimations
of CTC counts blood and causing erroneous prognosticative results.30

In contrast to separations based on physical
cell dynamics, biochemical or affinity-based approaches are considered
size and shape independent; although in the case of MACS, drag forces
do play a role in the isolation.31 Affinity-based
enrichment distinguished cells are based on specific antigen expression
methodologies, where the target cells are either labeled with a fluorescent/magnetic
bead tag or directly captured on a stationary substrate. This approach
allows for much higher efficiencies (<95%) than label-free approaches
but necessitates a way of removing the cells from the bound tags or
cell release from substrates. To date, there remains a lack of standardized
tag removal processes from cell surfaces32 although multiple methods have recently been developed to release
captured cells from adhesive surfaces. Traditionally, fluidic forces
and enzymatic treatment for cell detachment is the most common. The
process of shearing the cells off the surface poses the issue of possible
cell damage and subsequent reduction in viability. Enzymes digest
extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins thus causing cells to be released.
This treatment can be invasive as cell surface proteins (ion channels,
receptors, cell-to-cell junction proteins, etc.) are also digested.
Alternatively, temperature induced cell detachment methods, based
on the fact that ECM generally adheres to a hydrophobic surface rather
than a highly hydrophilic surface, have been engineered. Although
the microfluidic community understands the need for noninvasive cell
harvesting methods, only a few works in electrically induced,33,34 pH change-induced,35,36 degradable hydrogel coatings,37−40 and light-induced methods41,42 have attempted to address
this issue. An excellent review by Zheng et al. describes these approaches
in detail.43 Recently, work in aptamer
designs has also illustrated some promise as an alternative approach
to releasable functionalities.44

Furthermore, to ensure high fidelity isolation, the selection of
the capture ligand is paramount to target the cells of interest.18 Looking once again at the example of CTC separation,
most literature reports have used EpCAM as the capture and/or labeling
antibody.8,45 Although EpCAM does serves as an excellent
identifier of an epithelial cell (or carcinoma cell) in the bloodstream,
CTCs upon detachment from the primary tumor undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT).8,45 EMT results in a loss of EpCAM
expression and reduction in CTC enumeration and diagnostic efficacy.
Therefore, CTC separation presents a clear example of why there is
no “one size fits all” isolation method and that microfluidic
platforms need be specifically tailored to the overall objective.
By selecting a marker for a specific tumor type, such as PSMA for
prostate cancer,46,47 affinity-based microfluidic platforms
have shown excellent promise. On the other hand, cancers with a family
of different receptor expressions, such as breast cancers with Her2+
and Her2– populations or the various lung cancer phenotypes,48 are best isolated using size-based separation.
Again re-enforcing the claim of no “one size fits all”
isolation method.

Finally, an additional limitation to affinity-based
platforms is the lower throughput due to receptor–ligand kinetics
and/or instrument limitations (e.g., magnetic strength and fluorescent
interrogation constraints). A concern related to the binding kinetics
is the effective coating of these adhesion ligands (i.e., antibodies,
peptides, aptamers) to the substrate. In addition to reaction rates,
the number of binding events directly influences the enhancement of
the affinity-based cell sorting. Compounding the challenge is the
randomness of biomolecule orientation; for IgG antibodies, there are
two binding regions located on the molecule, but positioning these
regions in such a fashion as to minimize steric hindrance is difficult.
As described by Lauffenburger and co-workers,49,50 ligand coupling to a surface also results in a loss in the protein
activity. When coating substrates (beads or surfaces) with antibodies,
specifically, it has been shown that no more than one antibody-active
site is available and within those accessible sites only 20–50%
of those sites are actually active binding ligands. Overall, this
can result in low binding event efficiencies and large amounts of
unused and costly proteins.

The above brief review illustrates
why no “killer” separation platform has been demonstrated
and we believe, on the basis of the current literature, that a truly
universal cell separation device will likely never be engineered.
As one example, devices that aim to separate cells directly from small
volumes of whole blood must factor in that blood behaves as a non-Newtonian
fluid.51 Such a device would not work as
efficiently in the separation of lymphocyte populations from ophthalmologic
vitreous biopsy samples, which tend to have volumes >20 mL and
are mainly composed of Newtonian buffer wash solution.52 The unique constraints of the myriad of applications where cell separation plays a role along with metrics unique to each discipline make it difficult to design truly universal separation systems. Furthermore, even with the new advances in multicomponent
cell separation instruments, as described later, there are still no
approaches that we see addressing the various biological fluids, throughputs,
and conditions necessary to make the holy grail of cell separators.

Microfluidic
Cell Separation as Preprocessing Tools to Advance Companion Technologies
As mentioned earlier, microfluidic cell separation techniques stand
to play important roles in analytical (e.g., proteomics, genomics)
and clinical applications (e.g., diagnostics, tissue engineering,
and stem cell therapeutics). We term the operative technologies associated
with these applications as “companion technologies”.
In the clinical realm, there have been a number of recent diagnostic
assays developed on the basis of specific target cell populations
such as CTCs for metastatic cancer,30,53 mature endothelial
and endothelial progenitor cells for cardiovascular disease,54,55 fetal maternal red blood cells,56 and
malaria diagnostics.57 A fact unique to
diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring is that purity can and is generally
secondary to efficiency. Still, unfortunately, most of the current
diagnostic platforms have failed to meet all the efficiency requirements
for clinically relevant separation and enumeration tools. As an example,
the clinically defined threshold for CTC enumeration as a biomarker
for therapeutic monitoring is 5 cells/mL whole blood.53 This essentially equates to finding 1 target cell in a
billion nontarget cells. Here, it is imperative that every cell is
isolated from the sample, but in these cases, purity is not as important.
This is because, to date, all clinically used platforms use a detailed
fluorescent staining protocol to identify the CTCs in the isolate;
thus, nontarget cells can be easily excluded from the biomarker assay.
The sacrifice of a high purity in favor of extremely high recoveries
will continue to be imperative for microfluidic separation to succeed
in the clinic. On the other hand, one of the key challenges associated
with tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is isolation of
pure populations of cells, where efficiency is considered secondary.
Importantly, minimization of nontarget cell populations is critical
for tissue cultures that are intended for implantation. In addition,
the presence of surrounding nonspecific cell types may influence the
cell differentiation path; thus, pure populations are necessary for
controlled differentiation.58 High purity
isolations are also significant in -omic analyses (e.g., genomics
and proteomics), and fundamental biological assays as nontarget cells
result in unwanted background noise or interference.59 On the basis of the previous section and Table 1, platforms based on physical characteristics can
be tuned to provide high purity isolations but have not yet reached
efficiencies capable of a clinical diagnostic. Biochemical affinity-based
approaches, based on highly specific antigen targets, can yield high
efficiency separations but are inherently limited by the interference
of the labeling moieties, i.e., the receptor–ligand binding
itself can perturb the cell.60,61

Thus, the selection
of a microfluidic separator should be specifically tuned to the intended
application. The preferred devices for most fundamental biological
assays, including proteomics and genomics, are label-free to minimize
labeling interference, but in -omic analysis, because cells can be
lysed after purification, magnetic bead labels can be easily separated
from the lysate. Conversely, in both FACS and affinity-based separation,
it is a significant challenge to separate the bound species (receptor–ligand)
from the unbound solution species. This inherent limitation is also
true of other fundamental biological assays based on lysed cells,
where the binding chemistries cause interference in the analyses.

Of the many separation platforms, magnetic beads can successfully
provide high purity isolation but the beads pose a challenge in regenerative
and tissue engineering applications due to generation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS)62−64 and gene expression changes.65 When cells are exposed to metallic nanoparticles, ROS are produced with high chemical reactivity. High ROS levels
can damage cells by peroxidizing lipids, disrupting DNA, modulating
gene transcription, altering proteins, and resulting in a decline
in physiological function and cell apoptosis/death. On the other hand,
FACS and affinity-chromatography moieties can be internalized and
thus do not perturb the viability and/or function of the cells. It
should be noted that the presence of bound species could result in
a signaling cascade that will change the cells. This limitation also
goes for passive separations due to high physical forces, dielectric
stimulation, and even magnetic influences on some cells of interest.
This presents a chicken-and-egg problem of sorts wherein to separate
a cell type one must change the cell environment, at least minimally,
but such a change in the environment may affect the cell undesirably
from the standpoint of the final application. Two recent papers by
Vickers and co-workers60,66 have illustrated this principle,
where the authors show that a brief shear exposure can change the
receptor expression pattern of a cell60 and that the act of labeling cells with a ligand can cause receptor
recycling as well as expression changes.66 Without flow or receptor tagging, cells can generally not be effectively
separated; however, the above studies illustrate the need to verify
or control for changes in key cell properties, such as the receptor
expression profile or even overall phenotype.

In diagnostics
and therapeutic monitoring, the number of cells indicates the presence,
change, or remission of a disease state. High efficiency (i.e., every
cell must be accounted for) is needed. In most cases, staining67 or impedance68 can
be used to enumerate the cells of interest, but all the cells of interest
must be isolated and concentrated for this to be of value. Therefore,
affinity-based techniques that provide high efficiencies are ideal
candidates for diagnostics. Techniques like adhesion-based separation38 and FACS4 also allow
for the identification of cells based on multiple marker expressions,
such as distinguishing mature endothelial cells from endothelial progenitor
cells based on KDR+ expression on all endothelial cells and expression
of CD34+ only on stem cell populations.38 Separation of cells can be from small volumes of sample (blood drop
or biopsy punch) or from very large samples (vitreous humor samples).
Therefore, there is a need to be able to concentrate the samples down
to a feasible volume for interfacing with companion technologies (LC/MS,
PCR, culture plates, etc.). Postseparation, several additional treatments
may be needed thus presenting additional challenges to marrying microfluidics
to larger instrumentation. Proper buffers and postseparation conditions
for accurate analyses will be needed as instrumentation interfacing
progresses. Techniques that can trap the cell within the microchannel
(filters, optical trapping, and adhesion) or within solution (MACS)
are excellent candidates for concentrating, buffer exchanging, and
postanalysis treatments. Of course, these statements are contingent
on a clean and viable release of the cells or effective collection
of lysed cellular products, both challenges in their own right.

Overall, in the arena of supporting and advancing companion technologies,
we believe that new microfluidic sample processing tools will emerge
with better purity and efficiency capabilities as well as better integration
with the companion technology instrumentation. Second, these new platforms
will expectedly be tuned to both the companion technology type and
the sample type.

Avenues and Barriers in Commercialization
of Microfluidics-Based Devices
It is clear that microfluidics
has a high potential as an enabling technology for multiplexed, preprocessing
in a number of key biological areas. Over the past two decades, several
attempts from both start-up and larger corporations have emerged to
commercialize microfluidic cell separation platforms. These pioneering
companies, mostly in the diagnostics field, have argued that microfluidics
provides a better methodology for isolation of key cell populations
by reducing the device footprint and making the instrumentation more
mobile, providing a higher throughput versus the state of the art,
and reducing the overall cost of manufacturing. Although all these
points are definitely well founded, only a limited number of products
have been delivered to date.69,70 As the need for higher
efficiencies and better purities has accelerated, so has the complexity
of many of the devices. These overly intricate approaches only confound
commercialization strategies, presenting harder manufacturing parameters
and lowering the reliability of operation. A second factor that has
limited research in microfluidics and, in turn, commercialization
has been the funding of platforms that meet these requirements of
the industry. Approaches that are simple and robust are often not
considered sufficiently “innovative” from the standpoint
of bodies that fund academic research. This trend has, in our opinion,
led to a growing glut of new technologies that are simply too complex
and ineffective to cross the gap between academic laboratories and
the realm of robust, affordable, manufacturable, and useful devices.

Currently, end users are facing difficulties interfacing and synchronizing
the microfluidic components with existing hardware, and these new
techniques challenge current lab workflows, making adoption of these
platforms difficult. We believe by approaching microfluidic cell separation
from an interdisciplinary perspective, interfacing of techniques will
begin to receive more attention and adoption by the end-users will
increase. Overall, as microfluidics becomes more and more commonplace
in lab, clinical, and industry settings, these hurdles will naturally
diminish, but only time will tell when cell separation will move from
tabletop FACS instruments to hand-held sample processing tools.

Analogous to continual improvements being made in conventional FACS
technologies and methods, we expect continued evolution in miniaturized
analogs of FACS as well as MACS. These miniaturized analogs have the
advantage of posing lower barriers of entry to potential users and
therefore draw greater levels of activity in both academia and industry.
As mentioned in Table 1, a major limitation
of both of these techniques is the time and effort involved in tagging
specific cell types in a sample with either fluorescent or magnetic
tags. Coupling microscale analogs of FACS and MACS with on-chip tagging
is a relatively simple step for which approaches have already been
developed.71 Such coupling not only will
automate the tagging step but also has the potential to significantly
reduce the typical 30 min incubation time requirement. Beyond such
comparatively incremental improvements, it is our prediction that
major, paradigm-changing innovations in FACS and MACS will be rare.

It has been well noted
that material selection plays a large role in commercialization.72,73 In most academic laboratories, which universally contribute new
technology in industry and manufacturing, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)
is the polymer of choice for research due to its ease of use and cost
at the research scale. Researchers commonly require only few to a
hundred devices for experiments, whereby industry standards will minimally
require hundreds to thousands of devices. Unfortunately, PDMS is not
a commercially scalable material and thus can pose barriers to translation,
depending on the separation modality of choice. A notable exception, however, are the elastomeric properties of PDMS make it an excellent material for fluid
controls via displacement valving and pumping. Rigid polymers, like
cyclic olefins and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and rigid ceramics,
like silica and glass, require high capital cost and complex equipment
for fabrication, thus making implementation at the initial research
level more prohibitive. It should be noted that, once translated,
the cost per device related to rigid polymer fabrication is low and
the production line is in place and well established by the DVD/CD
industry. Furthermore, chemical treatments and functionalization strategies
have been proven for these rigid polymers, thus posing no further
barriers.74 Also, the initial capital cost
is not the only metric for commercial translation; one must also consider unit
production cost and production rate, as well as production compliance,
which rigid plastics can provide via the existing DVD pipeline.

The hydrophobicity of PDMS makes it an excellent candidate for many
size-based and adhesion-based techniques as the material properties
mitigate nonspecific binding. Materials like glass and silica, on
the other hand, have a high tendency for nonspecific binding and require
treatments to lower inefficiencies. Other characteristics that need
to be accounted for are the electrical and optical properties of the
substrate, specifically for dielectrophoresis and optics-based separations.
Autofluorescence can interfere with techniques that require probing
such as microfluidic FACS. With these few examples, we anticipate
the development of new elastic polymer candidates for microfluidics,
which have better overall properties and the scalability necessary
for manufacturing. We also envision the influence of 3D printing of
polymers and ceramics to play a role in advancing microfluidics, as
layering and interfacing of numerous materials is possible, thus allowing
for tuned substrate characteristics.

As first noted by Adams
and Soh,75 the integration of multiple
separation forces gives one the ability to precisely control the cell
separation dynamics and can allow for new modalities of separation.
For example, several groups have harnessed sized-based separation
platforms to effectively remove red blood cells from whole blood starting
samples in order to enhance purity and recovery metrics,76−78 and others have used combinations of other modalities, such as multistage
adhesion-based separation.38 Overall, relative
to single stage isolation methods, cooperative platforms that utilize
multiple separation modalities can typically provide superior recovery
and purity. We propose that, as the need for lower cell numbers and
more accurate separations are needed, approaches combining more than
one separation modality will be the optimal means to achieve these
metrics. We anticipate a greater focus on microfluidic separation
platforms that combine two or more separation techniques, offering
the opportunity for new scientific principles to be established in
addition to new technology.

Within the technological realm,
integration of the nonmicrofluidic elements of cell separation systems
remains a vexing challenge; however, a trend has been established
with recent journal publications describing the design and assembly
of an integrated “box”, i.e., a console which accepts
the starting sample, performs a microfluidic cell separation or sorting
process, including all sample and reagent transfer steps, and reports
a result or delivers a purified cell subset.79,80 While this growing trend addresses questions that inevitably arise
about translational potential when any new microfluidic cell separation
methodology is developed, it worth pausing to ask if such work belongs
within the scientific domain as opposed to that of commercial product
development.

Continued Evolution of Separation Science
in Microfluidic Cell Separation
The evolution of separation
science, including that of cell separation, has been guided by the
emergence of analytical challenges and companion technologies in a
broad range of fields such as clinical medicine, biology, proteomics,
and genomics, to name only a few. However, a considerable gap exists
between research communities in microfluidic cell separation and our
counterparts in these other disciplines. It is our view that major
advances in cell separation technologies will require a much closer
interaction between these communities. In the area of proteomics and
genomics, for instance, major opportunities exist for the miniaturization
and integration of sample preparation steps in order to handle limited
amounts of clinical samples. Microfluidic cell separation methods
can serve as the true front-end of such integrated sequences provided
they are integrated effectively with downstream processing steps.

For example, as stratification of patients for customized therapeutic
regimens becomes more common, proteomic profiling of specific cell
types in a biopsy may be critical. Achieving such capability will
require innovations in both technology and manufacturing. Challenges
such as concentrating the samples without sample losses, subsequent
cell lysis, and interfacing with mass spectrometry instrumentation
will all have to be overcome in a manner that, once again, is tailored
to a particular disease or therapy. Furthermore, with the ever-increasing
push for fast, cheaper, and smaller -omic platforms, microfluidic
components will inevitably provide the foundation of these techniques
both on the sample (front) end and in intermediate steps that relate
more to the companion -omic instrumentation.

On the basic science
side, while single cell
genomic technology has advanced significantly with regard to sequencing
and informatics, there is currently no directly interfaced cell procurement
and purification. As the need for specific cell analyses progresses,
not only will microfluidics be required to individually entrap single
cells but also a robust targeted separation method must be integrated
with current technologies. This poses a challenge in the context of
a broader “smaller, faster, and cheaper” mindset in
necessitating a multidisciplinary development scheme. Finally, we
also believe that insights into new and atypical cell separation modalities
may be revealed from the perspective of biology, for example, separations
based on cellular secretions, intracellular signaling activity, and
in vivo cell migration processes such as chemotaxis.

Future Microfluidic
Cell Separators
Microfluidic systems that handle and separate
cells have a unique ability to probe scientific questions outside
the domain of separation science. The combination of predictable fluid
shear properties, surface topography and chemistry, and microchannel
geometry have, for example, been utilized in studies of hematopoiesis81 and angiogenesis,82 to name only two examples. Combining microfluidic interrogation
of single cells using approaches described in the preceding sections
offers opportunities to apply big data principles in collecting and
handling information collected by integrated microfluidic cell separation
systems. Thus, we anticipate that major advances in the science of
microfluidic cell separation will occur concurrently with advances
in companion areas. As more and more such interdisciplinary studies
are performed and described in journals spanning many disciplines,
however, there will be an increasing risk of “reinventing the
wheel”, in other words performing studies and building devices
that are similar to those already described.

Conclusions
While
microfluidic cell separation has reached a point of relative maturity,
major challenges and significant barriers to the broad adoption of
existing techniques continue to exist. It is our prediction that activity
in this field will shift from the focus on individual modes of separation
demonstrated in highly specific contexts to multimodal microfluidic
cell separators that are well-integrated with companion analytical
technologies and downstream applications in the clinical and analytical
realms.
