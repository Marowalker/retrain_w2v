Aptamer microarrays are a promising
high-throughput method for
ultrasensitive detection of multiple analytes, but although much is
known about the optimal synthesis of oligonucleotide microarrays used
in hybridization-based genomics applications, the bioaffinity interactions
between aptamers and their targets is qualitatively different and
requires significant changes to synthesis parameters. Focusing on
streptavidin-binding DNA aptamers, we employed light-directed in situ
synthesis of microarrays to analyze the effects of sequence fidelity,
linker length, surface probe density, and substrate functionalization
on detection sensitivity. Direct comparison with oligonucleotide hybridization
experiments indicates that aptamer microarrays are significantly more
sensitive to sequence fidelity and substrate functionalization and
have different optimal linker length and surface probe density requirements.
Whereas microarray hybridization probes generate maximum signal with
multiple deletions, aptamer sequences with the same deletion rate
result in a 3-fold binding signal reduction compared with the same
sequences synthesized for maximized sequence fidelity. The highest
hybridization signal was obtained with dT 5mer linkers, and the highest
aptamer signal was obtained with dT 11mers, with shorter aptamer linkers
significantly reducing the binding signal. The probe hybridization
signal was found to be more sensitive to molecular crowding, whereas
the aptamer probe signal does not appear to be constrained within
the density of functional surface groups commonly used to synthesize
microarrays.

Sensitive
and accurate multiplexed
protein measurements are fundamental for modern biomedical research
and clinical practice. Immunoassays exploiting the diversity and specificity
of antibody–antigen binding are the most commonly used and
widely accepted methods for both single and multiplexed measurements.1 In recent years, however, aptamers—single-stranded
nucleic acids generated by in vitro selection from combinatorial libraries
to bind to specific target molecules (SELEX2−4)—are
providing an alternative path to sensitive protein analysis. Perhaps
one of the principal appeals of aptamer-based technology is that it
leverages highly developed and versatile chemical synthesis of nucleic
acids with in vitro selection to provide a purely chemical development
pathway. The tool palette for aptamer synthesis includes not only
natural DNA and RNA nucleoside monophosphates, but also non-natural
building blocks with modifications at the 2′ position, such
as 2′-O-methyl, 2′-fluoro-, and 2′-F-ANA;5−8 more profound sugar modifications, such as locked nucleic acid (LNA)
and hexitol nucleic acid (HNA);9−11 or backbone modifications, such
as phosphorodithioate linkages.12,13 The versatility of
phosphoramidite chemistry also extends to the facile synthesis of
complex microarrays, traditionally for genomics applications, but
readily adaptable to arrays of aptamers, both for aptamer optimization14,15 and for aptamer-based multiplexed protein detection.16−18 The widespread use of oligonucleotide microarrays for high-throughput
gene expression studies, as well as other hybridization-based genomics
applications, provides the analytical, technological, and manufacturing
infrastructure for the development of aptamer microarrays. Aptamer
microarrays consist of aptamers immobilized on a solid substrate.
Aptamer arrays are promising analytical tools because in vitro selection
provides nucleic acid sequences with specificities and binding affinities
comparable to those of monoclonal antibodies;19−21 however, they
are more stable22 as well as easier to
synthesize than antibody arrays because of the mature solid-phase
oligonucleotide synthesis and spotting technology, and in situ synthesis
of oligonucleotide microarrays using phosphoramidite chemistry.23−27

At the simplest level, oligonucleotide microarrays consist
only
of sequences of ∼25–60 nucleotides long immobilized
on a substrate in a defined pattern. However, in the case of traditional
hybridization-based microarray experiments, much effort has been devoted
to understanding and optimizing technical parameters influencing aspects
such as hybridization kinetics, efficiency, and signal intensity/noise
ratio to maximize their analytical power. Clearly, for both aptamer
arrays and hybridization-based arrays, sequence design is the most
important consideration, but here, we consider the impact of synthesis
parameters that also significantly affect microarray performance:
microarray surface chemistry, oligonucleotide surface density, sequence
fidelity, and surface-to-probe spacer length. We investigate the effect
of these parameters on aptamer signal intensity and make direct comparisons
with how the same parameters affect signal intensity in analogous
hybridization experiments to gain insight into how to best adapt existing
oligonucleotide microarray technology for aptamer-based bioaffinity
applications.

Surface chemistry is used to modify the glass
substrate to enable
DNA attachment and, therefore, also determines the surface density
of bound probes.28,29 Surface density strongly influences
hybridization intensity and signal due to steric factors.30 In addition, the surface functionalization serves
as a spacer, distancing the probes from the glass surface, which is
known to increase hybridization efficiency.28,31,32 In addition, the surface functionalization
changes surface electrostatics and hydrophobicity, which in turn influence
hybridization and background intensity.33−35 Although the surface
functionalization also serves
as a spacer, additional distance between the surface and the array
oligonucleotides can be introduced via specialized linker phosphoramidites
or by oligonucleotide sequences, typically poly(dT).25,36−38 Finally, oligonucleotide sequence fidelity also plays
a role in both hybridization and protein binding to aptamers. The
relationship between the number and position of mismatches in the
case of hybridization on microarrays is fairly predictable,39,40 but less so in the case of aptamers, in which the effect of mutations
is highly variable.14

Experimental Section
Microarray
Synthesis
DNA/aptamer microarrays were fabricated
using maskless array synthesis (MAS) as described previously.27,41 Briefly, microarray substrates were used as received from the manufacturer,
with the exception of the hydroxyl-functionalized substrates, which
were Schott Nexterion Glass D slides functionalized with N-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)-4-hydroxybutyramide (Gelest SIT8189.5).
These slides were loaded into a metal staining rack and completely
covered with a 500 mL solution consisting of 10 mg of the silane in
95:5 (v/v) ethanol/water and 1 mL of acetic acid. The slides were
covered and gently agitated for 4 h and then rinsed twice for 20 min
with gentle agitation in the same solution, but without the silane.
The slides were then drained and cured overnight in a preheated vacuum
oven (120 °C). The slides were stored in a desiccator cabinet
until use.

Microarrays were synthesized directly on the slides
using a maskless array synthesizer, which consists of an optical imaging
system that uses a digital micromirror device to deliver patterned
ultraviolet light near 365 nm to the synthesis surface. Microarray
layout and oligonucleotide sequences are determined by selective removal
of the 2-(2-nitrophenyl)propyloxycarbonyl (NPPOC) photocleavable 5′-hydroxyl
protecting group on the oligonucleotides. Reagent delivery and light
exposures are synchronized and controlled by a computer, which also
stores and orders the display on the micromirror array. The chemistry
is similar to that used in conventional solid-phase oligonucleotide
synthesis. The primary modification is the use of NPPOC phosphoramidites.
Upon absorption of a photon near 365 nm and in the presence of a weak
organic base, 1% (m/v) imidazole in DMSO, the NPPOC group comes off,
leaving a 5′-hydroxyl terminus that is able to react with an
activated phosphoramidite during the next synthetic cycle. After synthesis,
the microarrays were deprotected in 1:1 (v/v) ethylenediamine in ethanol
for 2 h at room temperature, washed twice with water, and stored dry
until use.

Microarray Linker-Length and Exposure-Gradient
Experiments
The effect of spacer length and hybridization
and aptamer binding
were determined on microarrays synthesized with spots with stepwise
increases in thymidine (dT) linker length (“linker gradients”)
followed by either the St-2-1 streptavidin binding aptamer sequence42 or a sequence (QC25) of similar length and known
to hybridize well (hybridization probes and aptamer sequences are
given in Table 1). The effect of sequence fidelity
on hybridization and aptamer binding were determined with microarrays
synthesized with a light-exposure gradient. Spots synthesized with
lower light exposure are insufficiently deprotected and therefore
have deletion errors. These arrays were synthesized with a fixed-length
dT 5mer linker and an exposure gradient between 0.2 and 18 J/cm2 at 365 nm. There is an exponential relationship between exposure
and deprotection, with 6 J/cm2 corresponding to ∼99%
NPPOC removal, and 12 J/cm2 corresponding to >99.9%
removal
(1% and <0.1% deletions per synthesis cycle, respectively).27

a Binding affinity was determined
by Bing et al. in a competition assay with FAM-labeled St-2-1. On
our arrays, St-2-1_rev was used as a negative control sequence. The
correlation between the affinity data and microarray binding data
is given in Figure 6.

Exposure gradient and spacer gradient microarrays
were hybridized
in an adhesive chamber (SecureSeal SA200, Grace Biolabs) with a solution
consisting of 0.3 pmol of 5′-Cy3-labeled probe, 40 μg
of herring sperm DNA, and 200 μg of acetylated BSA in 400 μL
of MES buffer (100 mM MES, 1 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 0.01% Tween-20).
After 2 h of rotation at 42 °C, the chamber was removed, and
the microarrays were vigorously washed in a 50 mL centrifuge tube
with 30 mL of nonstringent wash buffer (SSPE; 0.9 M NaCl, 0.06 M phosphate,
6 mM EDTA, 0.01% Tween-20) for 2 min and then, similarly, with stringent
wash buffer (100 mM MES, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.01% Tween-20) for 1 min. Finally,
the microarrays were dipped for a few seconds in the final wash buffer
(0.1 × SSC) and then dried with a microarray centrifuge. Arrays
were scanned with a Molecular Devices GenePix 4400A, and the intensity
data were extracted with GenePix Pro.

Aptamer Array QC Hybridization
To determine the quality
of the synthesized aptamer arrays, the arrays were hybridized with
a mixture containing 15 different 25-mer and 50-mer Cy3-labeled QC
oligomers (QC1-5, Sigma Genosis, UK; QC6-15, IDT, Belgium) varying
in concentration from 0.01 to 100 pM. A solution of 5xSSC/0.1% SDS
(SSC, AccuGene Lonza, Belgium; SDS, Sigma, USA) was used as the hybridization
buffer. The hybridization mixture was preheated for 5 min at 95 °C,
and a volume of 440 μL was used for hybridization in Agilent-one
backing slides (G2534-60005, Agilent). Arrays were hybridized over
18 h in an Agilent oven at 45 °C. After hybridization, arrays
were quickly rinsed with 6xSSPE/0.01% Tween-20 at room temperature
(r.t.) (SSPE, AccuGene Lonza, Belgium; Tween-20, Sigma, Switzerland),
washed at r.t. with 6xSSPE/0.01% Tween-20 for 1 min, washed at 45
°C with 0.6xSSPE/0.01% Tween-20 for 10 min, and washed at r.t.
with 6xSSPE/0.01% Tween-20 for 10 min. Finally, arrays were dried
by centrifugation and scanned at PMT10 using the Agilent High-Resolution
C Scanner. Data were extracted using ImaGene 7.5 software.

On-Array
Streptavidin Binding Assay
To determine the
optimal synthesis parameters for on-array aptamer binding experiments,
arrays were used to monitor binding of streptavidin to aptamer sequences
on the array after the quality check by QC hybridization. First, the
arrays were prewetted with 5xSSC/0.01%-Tween-20 for 30 min at 45 °C.
Next, the arrays were blocked with SuperblockT20 (Thermo Scientific)
for 30 min at room temperature (r.t.). After blocking, the arrays
were incubated with streptavidin (ProSpec, USA) using an incubation
mixture containing 1xPBS/1 mM MgCl2/0.01% Tween-20/1% BSA/10
μg per mL streptavidin (PBS, Ambion, USA; MgCl2,
Sigma, Germany; BSA, Sigma, USA). Incubation was performed at r.t.
for 30 min. After streptavidin incubation, the arrays were rinsed
three times with 1xPBS/1 mM MgCl2/0.05% Tween-20 and subsequently
washed with the same buffer for 75 min at r.t., then the arrays were
incubated for 30 min at r.t. with Cy5-labeled biotin, using a mixture
containing 1xPBS/1 mM MgCl2/0.01% Tween-20/1 nM Biotin-dT5-Cy5 (IDT). After biotin incubation, the arrays were rinsed
three times with 1xPBS/1 mM MgCl2/0.05% Tween-20, and subsequently
washed with the same buffer for 30 min at r.t. After a final quick
rinse with deionized water, the arrays were dried by centrifugation
and scanned at PMT10 using the Agilent high-resolution C scanner.
Data were extracted using ImaGene 7.5 software.

Results and Discussion
Influence
of T-Spacer Length on Aptamer Binding vs DNA Hybridization
To test the influence of dT-spacers on the ability of the St-2-1
aptamer (Table 2) to bind to streptavidin,
an array was synthesized on hydroxyl-functionalized substrates, with
the aptamer sequence on spacers ranging in length from an oligo-dT
1mer to 25mers. The linkers were synthesized without capping steps
to preserve equal probe density. To make a direct comparison with
the influence of the spacers on DNA hybridization on the microarrays,
the same array design was synthesized with the 25mer sequence (GTC
ATC ATC ATG AAC CAC CCT GGT C). In both cases, the surface functionalization
contributes ∼10 carbon–carbon bond lengths to the spacer,
approximately equivalent to 2 dTs. Figure 1 summarizes the results of these experiments, which indicate that
there is an optimum spacer length in both cases: dT5 for
hybridization and dT11 for aptamer binding. In the case
of hybridization on microarrays, it is known that a spacer improves
hybridization by making the probe more accessible; on the other hand,
excessively long spacers can hinder hybridization, presumably because
ssDNA forms a random coil on the surface, allowing the probe to be
covered, or “dissolved” in a mass of linker DNA.31

The effect of spacer length on hybridization
can be clearly seen in experiments with radiolabeled DNA. Shchepinov
et al.30 found a signal maximum with 10
couplings of a spacer phosphoramidite, equivalent to a total length
of about 100 carbon–carbon bonds. Fluorescent labeling of the
target sequence obscures the effect due to interactions between the
fluorescent dye and the microarray substrate. Proximity to the surface
greatly increases the fluorescence of cyanine dyes in hybridization
experiments.37 We have also observed this
effect with microarrays synthesized with oligonucleotides of increasing
lengths terminated by a coupling with a Cy3 or Cy5 phosphoramidite
(data not shown). The results in Figure 1 are
the convolution of the two effects and indicate that the optimum spacer
length for the aptamer is significantly longer than the optimum in
the hybridization studies. That the St-2-1 aptamer binding signal
decreases after 11 dTs is in contrast with the results for the IgE-binding
aptamer, for which the signal is proportional to the oligo(dT) length
up to at least dT 20mers.14 Lao et al.43 also found that the fluorescence signal from
human α-thrombin HTQ and HTDQ aptamer binding was significantly
higher for a dT12 vs a dT6 spacer, but did not
explore other oligo(dT) lengths. In all of these cases, the labeling
dyes used were cyanine dyes, which suggests that specific aptamer
properties, rather than dye–substrate interactions, are the
source of the differing spacer requirements, but we cannot exclude
the possibility that differences between Cy3- and Cy5-labeling account
for the difference. Nevertheless, it seems likely that the optimum
spacer length for aptamer microarrays will need to be independently
optimized for each aptamer and for each labeling dye.

Role of Sequence Fidelity and Surface Density in Aptamer Binding
vs Hybridization
The tolerance of aptamer microarrays to
sequence error is important for maximizing the binding signal. Sequence
fidelity is particularly relevant in the case of in situ microarray
synthesis, for which postsynthesis oligonucleotide purification is
not possible. Phosphoramidite chemistry has been optimized to yield
average stepwise coupling efficiencies well above 99% for DNA monomers
and ∼99% for RNA monomers, for both solid-phase synthesis and
in situ synthesis on microarrays,27,44 but other
sources of error, most prominently depurination, reduce the overall
yield further.45 Spotted microarrays may
use HPLC- or gel electrophoresis-purified oligonucleotides to reach
a sequence purity greater than ∼85%, although the value for
this level of purity has not been established for aptamer applications
or for traditional microarray applications. In addition to lacking
the option of oligonucleotide purification, in situ microarray synthesis
results in a significantly higher error rate as a result of the additional
complexity associated with the simultaneous synthesis of large numbers
of sequences.25,27 Here, we take advantage of the
high degree of control afforded by maskless array synthesis (MAS)
to assess the sequence fidelity requirement of hybridization vs protein
binding to aptamers.

When a single, short sequence is synthesized
on a microarray substrate with MAS, the minimal complexity results
in very high fidelity oligonucleotides. This is a result of the elimination
of stray light effects present when multiple sequences are synthesized
simultaneously as well as by the intrinsically low rate of depurination
and other side reactions in the MAS chemistry, which does not use
acidic conditions and requires minimal exposure to oxidants.27 Synthesis errors can then be introduced in a
controlled manner by reducing the UV light exposure, which results
in decreased NPPOC cleavage and, hence, the introduction of deletion
errors.

Figure 2 (black squares) shows
the results
from a hybridization experiment on a microarray synthesized with a
light exposure gradient between 0.2 and 18 J/cm2 at 365
nm. The fraction of NPPOC groups cleaved with a given light exposure
is a first-order exponential with the form 1-e–t/τ, where t is the light exposure
and τ is a rate constant of ∼1.3 J/cm2.27 The fraction of sequences with no deletion errors
is therefore ∼(1 – e–t/τ)n, where n is the sequence
length. Microarray features (“spots”) that receive the
lowest exposures have a very low surface density of hybridizable oligonucleotides
(“hybridizable” is defined here as capable of forming
a hybrid under typical stringent hybridization conditions), but the
hybridization signal increases rapidly to reach a maximum around 6
J/cm2. At this exposure, ∼5% of the NPPOC groups
remain attached (12 J/cm2 is required for >99.9% photodeprotection).
This is a clear indication that microarrays used in hybridization
experiments have a very high error tolerance. For the 25mer sequence
used in these experiments, the 6 J/cm2 optimum exposure
results in ∼75% of sequences with at least one deletion error.
Surface density of oligonucleotides plays a role in this effect, as
it is known that hybridization efficiency decreases quickly with oligonucleotide
surface density, presumably due to steric crowding.31,46

We hypothesized that microarray hybridization efficiency remains
constant above a certain oligonucleotide fidelity threshold because
then the critical parameter is the density of hybridizable oligonucleotides,
rather than just the density of the oligonucleotides. This is because
the single-to-double-stranded transition doubles both the surface
density of oligonucleotides and the density of charged groups, hindering
further hybridization. In addition, the much higher persistence length
of dsDNA (∼50 nm47) vs ssDNA (∼2
nm48) may restrict diffusion near the surface
and thereby inhibit further hybridization.

To test this hypothesis,
we reduced the surface density by 50%
after the linker synthesis using a light exposure corresponding to
a 50% NPPOC cleavage (2 J/cm2) and capped the resulting
5′-OH groups with a dimethoxytrityl-dT phosphoramidite (DMT-dT)
coupling.49 The same 25mer sequence as
above was then synthesized with an exposure gradient, and the results
are plotted alongside those of the full density experiment in Figure 2 (red circles). These data indicate that the hybridization
signal reaches ∼80% of the intensity of the full density results.
In addition, the light exposure resulting in maximum signal shifts
higher, to at least 10 J/cm2 or perhaps more, as the slope
remains slightly positive up to 18 J/cm2. These results
are compatible with our hypothesis. Specifically, the signal is much
higher than 50%, indicating that hybridization on the full density
array, and at exposures greater than 6 J/cm2, is constrained
by molecular crowding. In addition, the optimum light exposure of
the 50% density data is much higher, indicating that with reduced
molecular crowding, the increase in sequence fidelity resulting from
greater light exposures leads to increased hybridization. The optimum
light exposure also depends on sequence length, with light exposure
gradients of 60mers reaching a maximum hybridization signal at ∼3
J/cm2 (Supporting Information Figure S1), which is also in agreement with the crowding hypothesis,
since longer sequences result in a greater mass of DNA on the surface.

Figure 2 Normalized
hybridization fluorescent signals for a single 25mer
sequence synthesized with a photodeprotection light exposure gradient
between 0.2 and 18 J/cm2. The black squares are from a
microarray synthesized for maximum surface density of oligonucleotides.
The red circles are from an equivalent experiment, but with the oligonucleotide
surface density reduced by 50% by a partial light exposure followed
by capping. The microarray layout is the same as for the data shown
in Figure 1, but with 25 exposure steps replacing
the 25 linker steps.

The St-2-1 aptamer binds to the 60 kDa protein streptavidin,
a
much bulkier macromolecule than the 8 kDa complementary 25mer sequence
in the hybridization experiments. In addition, the St-2-1 aptamer
forms a double-stranded structure with two loops, which may further
increase molecular crowding at the microarray surface. As a result,
we hypothesized that St-2-1 aptamer microarrays would have a lower
optimal oligonucleotide density. We also hypothesized that the aptamer
array would be less error-tolerant than the comparable hybridization
array. The sensitivity of aptamers to sequence fidelity was explored
by Katilius et al.,14 who used in situ
synthesized microarrays to determine the effect of mutations on the
affinity of the IgE-binding aptamer. They found that the majority
of single mutations result in near complete loss of binding. Similar
experiments exploring the effects of defects on hybridization affinity,
also on microarrays, indicated that hybridization is significantly
less error-sensitive.40

To test the
role of sequence fidelity and surface density in aptamer
microarrays, we synthesized the St-2-1 aptamer with the same light
exposure gradient as in the hybridization experiment above. Figure 3 (black squares) shows that the optimum exposure,
11 J/cm2, is almost twice that of the hybridization experiment,
confirming that the aptamer is more sensitive to errors. Another feature
of these data is that after the optimum exposure, the aptamer binding
signal drops significantly, which may be an indication of molecular
crowding. To test whether the aptamer binding signal is constrained
by crowding, the same array was resynthesized with the surface density
reduced by 50% after the linker synthesis using the same partial exposure
and capping procedure as above. The signal intensity of the 50% density
array is shown in Figure 3 (red circles). The
data show that the binding signal is reduced by approximately 50%,
indicating that, unlike the hybridization results, binding is not
significantly constrained by molecular crowding at the normal microarray
oligonucleotide surface densities. The curves in Figure 3 exhibit a clear drop at very high light exposures. Since
the maxima and the extent of subsequent decline is similar for both
surface densities, the effect cannot be attributed to crowding.

By 12 J/cm2, the photodeprotection is essentially complete
(∼99.9%), and additional exposure would not significantly improve
the sequence fidelity. Since aptamers appear to be much more sensitive
to sequence error than hybridization probes, we speculate that the
drop in signal is a consequence of errors introduced by the very high
light exposure itself. It is well-known that high doses of UV-A are
capable of inducing both single-strand DNA breaks and pyrimidine dimers.50 This result indicates that methods to increase
the aptamer surface density, for example, by using substrates functionalized
at a higher density (see below) or by the use of branching phosphoramidites,
could be effective in increasing aptamer binding signal.

The red circles are from an equivalent experiment, but with a microarray

Influence of the Substrate on Aptamer Binding
and DNA Hybridization
Surface chemistry is necessary to modify
the glass surface to enable
the initial phosphoramidite coupling reaction. This surface functionalization
determines the surfaced density of bound oligonucleotides. Functionalization
chemistry may also affect hybridization by increasing the distance
to the glass surface and by changing the surface electrostatics and
hydrophobicity, properties which are also known to influence hybridization
and nonspecific target binding and, hence, background intensity.33−35 To evaluate the effect of surface chemistry on both aptamer binding
and hybridization, we synthesized microarrays containing a variety
of hybridization probes and aptamers on four different types of functionalized
glass substrates: Corning UltraGAPS (Gamma Amino Propyl Silane), Schott
Nexterion Slide A+ (GAPS; 1.0 ± 0.3 × 1012 molecules/cm2), Schott Nexterion ring-opened Slide E (epoxysilane, 5.6
± 0.3 × 1012 molecules/cm2). Surface
densities were provided by Schott, but not Corning. The fourth substrate
was functionalized in-house as described in the Experimental
Section and have a surface hydroxyl density of about 2.7 ×
1012 molecules/cm2.49

Figure 4 shows sections of fluorescent
images from the same microarray design synthesized on the four substrate
types. The microarrays include both aptamers and hybridization probes
but were synthesized with light exposures of 11 J/cm2 to
maximize aptamer binding signals. To maximize their comparability,
all four microarrays were synthesized consecutively from the same
batch of reagents and monomers, and the hybridization assays, followed
by the aptamer binding assay, were performed on the four arrays in
parallel. Differences in signal and background intensity are apparent
for both the aptamer binding signal (Red/Cy5) and hybridization signals
(Green/Cy3). The charts in Figure 5 compare
the aptamer binding and hybridization signals between microarrays
synthesized on the different surfaces and with a dT10 spacer.
There is a substantial substrate-dependent difference in aptamer signal,
with the UltraGAPS giving a much higher signal than the other substrates.
Table 2 gives additional data on the ratios
of signal-to-control, signal-to-background, and relative standard
deviations of the aptamer signal on the four substrates, and the UltraGAPS
substrate leads to substantially better results in all these categories.
Since both the UltraGAPS and the A+ substrates are γ-aminopropyl
silane functionalized, the higher signal from the UltraGAPS slide
may indicate that this substrate is manufactured with a higher density
of functional groups than the A+ substrates. Among the three substrates
with known surface densities of functional groups, there is no correlation
between surface density and aptamer binding signal. However, we cannot
exclude that differences among the substrates, other than surface
density, are responsible.

Figure 4 Fluorescent images of sections of microarrays
synthesized on different
substrates. (A) Corning UltraGAPS, (B) Schott Epoxy ring-opened, (C)
Schott A+, (D) Schott Glass D hydroxyl-functionalized with N-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)-4-hydroxybutryramide. Green features
are hybridization signals from Cy3-labeled sequences. Red features
are from Cy5-labeled biotin binding to the streptavidin–aptamer
pairs. A scheme identifying the sequences corresponding to the spots
can be found in the Supporting Information. The arrays were synthesized with light exposures of 11 J/cm2 and with 32 × 32 μm features (4 DMD mirrors) separated
by gaps of 48 μm. All images were acquired with the same scanner
settings.

Figure 5 Aptamer binding and hybridization signal comparison
between microarrays
synthesized with four different surface chemistries (left to right):
Corning UltraGAPS/amino-modified; Schott E/epoxy-modified, ring-opened;
Schott A+/amino-modified; and in-house hydroxyl-functionalized. Top:
St-2-1 aptamer–streptavidin binding signal. Bottom: hybridization
signal for three probes hybridized with 1 and 100 pM complementary
sequences. Error bars are the standard deviation among replicates.

Hybridization data from the same
microarrays are also shown in
Figure 5. Each microarray included the probes
described in Table 1: QC1, and QC11, the complementary
sequences to which were included in the hybridization solution at
a concentration of 100 pM. The complementary sequence probes QC3,
QC8, and QC13 were present in the hybridization solution at a concentration
of 1 pM. Whereas the UltraGAPS substrate performed substantially better
than the other substrates in the aptamer binding assay, none of the
substrates was clearly superior in the hybridization data. There is
a clear indication in the data that the relationship between hybridization
signal and substrate is heterogeneous and sequence-specific, suggesting
that the surface chemistry significantly influences both hybridization
and aptamer binding.

On-Array Streptavidin Binding Assay under
Optimized Conditions
To test the suitability of the optimized
synthesis conditions (11mer
dT linker, 11J/cm2 light deprotection) for on-array aptamer
screening, a panel of streptavidin-binding aptamers were chosen as
a model. In 2010, Bing et al. described the streptavidin-binding aptamer
St-2-1 and a series of St-2-1-derived mutated sequences and their
binding affinity for streptavidin measured in a competition assay
with FAM-labeled St-2-1.42 The percentage
FAM-labeled St-2-1 replaced by the tested aptamer was determined as
a measure of binding affinity for the aptamer (Table 1). In Figure 6, the on-array signals for the St-2-1 variants of Table 1 are plotted against the affinity data described
in Bing et al., resulting in a correlation coefficient of 0.92.

Figure 6 Correlation
between data of an on-array aptamer binding assay (14
replicate spots on array) and an off-array competition experiment
published by Bing et al. Blue dots are the St-2-1 and the mutated
variants of St-2-1 shown in Table 1. Dotted
line indicates the signal of the negative control St-2-1_rev.

Figure 7 shows the effect of single mutations
in the 29-mer St-2-1 aptamer sequence. For every position, all possible
variants were tested, resulting in 87 mutants. The single mutations
appear to be less critical in the terminal stem sequence when the
mutation is at a distance of four or more bases from the bulge (Figure 7, blue bars). Single mutations in the central stem
between both bulges are highly critical (Figure 7, red bars). This is in agreement with the findings of Bing et al.,
who found that the hairpin bulge structure is critical for streptavidin
binding. Most single mutations in the bulges are critical. In their
paper, Bing et al. describe that G8, G15, and G18 are important to
maintain good binding, and we observe the same in our data. Replacing
the G at these positions by one of the other bases lowers the binding
affinity to the level of the negative control. Mutant T10C appears
to be the only mutant with the same binding affinity as St-2-1.

Figure 7 Effect of mutations
in the 29-mer St-2-1 aptamer sequence on the
binding affinity. Binding was tested using an on-array streptavidin
binding assay. Black bar, St-2-1; blue bars, mutation in the terminal
stem; green bars, mutation in the bulges; red bars, mutation in the
sequences between the bulges. Error bars are based on 12 replicates
on the array. Signal negative control St-2-1_rev =28.4.

Figure 8 shows the results
of mutants that
had one base pair replacement in the double stranded parts of St-2-1.
All 27 possible base pair replacements were present on the array (12
replicates). From the results, it can be seen that base pair T14A21 is most critical, since every other combination
tested at this position resulted in a significant loss of signal in
the streptavidin binding assay. Furthermore, there are a few other
replacements that lower the binding affinity significantly, at positions
A5T25 (replacement by C5G25 or T5A25) and T12A23 (replacement by C12G23). The insets in Figure 8 show the secondary structure of the variants A12T23, G12C23, and C12G23. In accordance with the data from the on-array streptavidin-binding
assay, mutant C12G23 is structurally distinct
from St-2-1 and has a much reduced binding affinity, whereas mutants
A12T23 and G12C23 are
structurally similar to St-2-1 and retain a similar binding affinity
(DNA structures from http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold/dna-folding-form).51 Together, these data show that aptamer
arrays are a powerful tool for aptamer screening.

Figure 8 Effect of base pair replacements
in the double-stranded parts of
St-2-1. Binding was tested using an on-array streptavidin binding
assay. Black bar, St-2-1; blue bars, mutation in the terminal stem;
red bars, mutation in the sequence between the bulges. Error bars
are based on 12 replicates on the array. Secondary structure of the
variants A12T23, G12C23, and C12G23. The structural variant C12G23 correlates with reduced streptavidin binding
on-array.

Conclusions
Using
the versatility of in situ synthesis of oligonucleotide microarrays,
we have explored the impact of synthesis parameters on aptamer microarray
performance and made direct comparisons with similar hybridization-based
arrays. The results indicate that, relative to traditional hybridization
assays, aptamer microarray detection can be significantly improved
by increasing the spacer length and by maximizing oligonucleotide
sequence fidelity. Aptamer microarrays also appear to be less sensitive
than hybridization microarrays to molecular crowding, proving a pathway
for further improvement. The functionalization chemistry of the glass
substrate also significantly affects the aptamer binding signal, either
by modifying the oligonucleotide surface density, or via electrostatic
or hydrophobic interactions with the aptamers or target protein. Aptamers
are likely to prove more heterogeneous than hybridization probes in
regard to optimum microarray parameters because of their varied 3-D
structures and modes of interactions with their targets, and therefore,
additional synthesis optimizations with a variety of aptamers will
be necessary to understand the full extent of variability.
