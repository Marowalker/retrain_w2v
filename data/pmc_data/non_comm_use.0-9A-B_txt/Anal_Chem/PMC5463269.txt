Mitochondrial dynamics
play an important role within several pathological
conditions, including cancer and neurological diseases. For the purpose
of identifying therapies that target aberrant regulation of the mitochondrial
dynamics machinery and characterizing the regulating signaling pathways,
there is a need for label-free means to detect the dynamic alterations
in mitochondrial morphology. We present the use of dielectrophoresis
for label-free quantification of intracellular mitochondrial modifications
that alter cytoplasmic conductivity, and these changes are benchmarked
against label-based image analysis of the mitochondrial network. This
is validated by quantifying the mitochondrial alterations that are
carried out by entirely independent means on two different cell lines:
human embryonic kidney cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. In both
cell lines, the inhibition of mitochondrial fission that leads to
a mitochondrial structure of higher connectivity is shown to substantially
enhance conductivity of the cell interior, as apparent from the significantly
higher positive dielectrophoresis levels in the 0.5–15 MHz
range. Using single-cell velocity tracking, we show ∼10-fold
higher positive dielectrophoresis levels at 0.5 MHz for cells with
a highly connected versus those with a highly fragmented mitochondrial
structure, suggesting the feasibility for frequency-selective dielectrophoretic
isolation of cells to aid the discovery process for development of
therapeutics targeting the mitochondrial machinery.

==== Body
Mitochondria,
which are key
regulators of metabolism and cell death within eukaryotic cells, undergo
constant cycles of fusion and fission, thereby allowing the cell to
quickly adapt to environmental conditions for promoting cellular health.1−3 Mutation and aberrant regulation of the mitochondrial fusion and
fission machinery is associated with a number of human diseases,4−6 including Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease,
and diabetes,7 as well as in physiological
processes whose dysregulation are classical hallmarks of human cancer.4 Since increased mitochondrial fission can promote
glycolysis,8 it has been postulated that
tumors may increase mitochondrial fission activity to promote the
metabolic shifts9 that create the molecular
building blocks required for rapid proliferation.10 Hence, analysis of phenotypes caused by mitochondria shaping
proteins can help uncover new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies
for disease states, especially in conjunction with tools that monitor
specificity of the subcellular alterations.

Activation of the
Ras-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway
promotes phosphorylation of the mitochondrial fission GTPase Drp1
(dynamin-related protein 1), which subsequently induces mitochondrial
fission. On the other hand, mitofusin proteins 1 and 2 (MFN1/2) on
the outer mitochondrial membrane are responsible for reversing the
mitochondrial fission pathway.11 In recent
work,12 we demonstrated that mitochondrial
fission was required for tumor growth in a xenograft model of pancreatic
cancer, since its inhibition through shRNA-mediated knockdown of Drp1
was shown to block tumor growth. It has also been shown that mitochondrial
fission promotes maintenance of stem cells in glioma and that inhibition
of Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission can effectively block tumor
growth in a mouse model of gliomagenesis.13 Despite the wealth of data linking mitochondrial fission to tumor
growth, the discovery of therapeutics targeting the mitochondrial
machinery has been limited. One reason is a lack of robust methods
to analyze dynamic changes in mitochondrial morphology. Genetic and
pharmacological screens are powerful tools to identify novel signaling
pathways and new inhibitors, but they require unbiased and quantitative
readouts. Previous quantification attempts based on high-content image
analysis require stains or markers to identify mitochondria and also
require the fixing of cells for optimal images.14 Apart from being time-consuming, this methodology cannot
be easily applied to nonadherent cell types such as immune cells and
is not capable of isolating live cell populations based on their mitochondrial
structure, especially from heterogeneous samples, for downstream quantitative
analysis.

In this work, we explore a label-free approach based
on cell electrophysiology
to quantify alterations to mitochondrial structure induced by Drp1
and MFN1/2, which are independently quantified by mitochondrial image
analysis of the respective labeled cells. Electrophysiology-based
methods are of interest since they can characterize the mitochondrial
alterations, as well as enable frequency-selective dielectrophoretic
isolation of cells with a particular mitochondrial morphology for
downstream analysis. Dielectrophoresis (DEP) causes the frequency-selective
translation of polarized bioparticles under a spatially nonuniform
electric field, either toward the high-field region by positive DEP
(pDEP) for highly polarizable particles versus the media, or away
from high-field region by negative DEP (nDEP) for particles within
highly polarizable media.15,16 The DEP frequency spectra
can be fit using a standard shell dielectric model to compute conductivity
of cell interior,17 which strongly depends
on the maximum level of pDEP of a cell in the megahertz (MHz) range,
at a given media conductivity.18−20 Herein, we show a significant
enhancement in cellular pDEP levels in the 0.5–15 MHz range
after genetic manipulations that inhibit mitochondrial fission, as
validated using independent mitochondrial modification methods that
are carried out on two different cell lines: Drp1 knockdown on human
embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and Drp1 knockout on mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEFs). On the basis of this, we infer that significant
alterations in intracellular mitochondrial structure can be identified
and quantified, suggesting feasibility for utilizing label-free dielectrophoretic
methods to selectively isolate cells based on their mitochondrial
morphology.

Materials and Methods
Cell Lines
Generation of HEK cells
expressing HRasG12V
plus Drp1 shRNA or shScramble control were previously described.12 Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with Mfn1/2
knockout (MfnKO MEFs) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC). To generate Drp1 knockout MEFs, Drp1flox/flox mice21 were bred to TP53flox/flox mice.22 MEFs were generated from Drp1flox/flox; TP53flox/flox embryos and subsequently infected with
adeno-associated-CMV-Cre-GFP (AAV-CMV-Cre-GFP, University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill Vector Core). Single-cell clones were isolated
and recombination of both alleles of Drp1 and p53 was confirmed by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Cell Imaging for Analysis
of Mitochondrial Morphology
The described HEK and MEF cell
lines were plated on glass microslides
a day prior to visualization of their mitochondria by one of the following
methods: (1) cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with α-Tom20
primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in conjunction with an
α-rabbit Alexa-488 secondary antibody (Life Technologies); (2)
cells were engineered to stably express mitochondria-targeted YFP23 (BD Biosciences). The Tom20 antibody has been
extensively validated to specifically recognize mitochondrial features.24 The alternative staining method is based on
a vector expressing YFP that is fused to the N-terminal mitochondrial
targeting sequence of subunit VIII of human cytochrome c oxidase (a mitochondrial transmembrane protein). A Zeiss LSM 700
confocal microscope with 63× oil objective was used for mitochondrial
imaging, with image analysis presented in the Results
and Discussion section. Flow cytometry of suspended cells (see Supporting Information sections S1 and S2) was
used to confirm that there were no substantial alterations to the
size of HEK cells after genetic alteration of their mitochondrial
morphology.

Dielectrophoretic Spectral
Measurements
DEP spectral
analysis was performed with unlabeled cells (∼106/mL). Prior to the DEP experiments, the cell media was replaced with
8.8% sucrose water, with media conductivity of 150 ± 5% mS/m,
as adjusted by its own culture media. Viability of cells within this
altered media was verified over a period of 1 h, as assessed by trypan
blue exclusion and by stability of their mitochondrial morphologies
by immunofluorescence (see Supporting Information section S1). DEP spectral measurements
were conducted on a 3DEP dielectrophoretic analyzer (DepTech, Uckfield,
U.K.) using a recording interval set to 30 s at 10 Vpp,
with data collected over 20 points between 100 kHz and 45 MHz. In
this 3DEP reader, the electric field is applied to gold-plated conducting
electrode stripes inside the wall of each well, with the DEP response
measured at 20 different frequencies that are applied individually
within each well. The relative DEP force at each frequency is obtained
by analyzing spatiotemporal variations in light intensity from particle
scattering using particular bands in each of the 20 wells, after normalization
to the background at zero field (time = 0), after accounting for the
field profile.25,26 For each batch of cells, the
relative DEP force at each frequency was obtained using two independent
measurements and this process was repeated for five separate batches
of the same cell type to ensure reproducibility, as per the error
bars. The maximum pDEP force level in the megahertz range for each
cell line (HEK and MEFs) was used as the basis to normalize all other
measured DEP force levels for the respective cell line. This assumes
that the maximum pDEP level for each cell line occurs when the cell
achieves its maximum polarization level for a particular modification.

Fitting DEP Spectra Using a Multishell Dielectric Model
In order to discern the particular subcellular regions influenced
by the mitochondrial alterations carried out herein, the acquired
DEP spectra over the 0.1–40 MHz range was fit to a standard
three-shell or four-layer dielectric model of the cell. The layers
from cell interior to its envelope include the nucleus, nuclear envelope,
cytoplasm, and cell membrane17 (Figure 1). The time averaged
DEP force (FDEP) on spherical particles
is given by 1  Here, εm is the permittivity
of the medium surrounding the cell, R is the radius
of the cell, ω is the radian frequency of the applied field,
and E is the electric field in the region where the
cell is located. The Clausius–Mossotti factor (Ki(ω)) is a frequency-dependent measure of cell polarizability
determining
force direction as 2  Here, εm* and εc′* are the
complex permittivity of the medium and effective permittivity of cell,
respectively. In each case, the complex permittivity depends on the
respective permittivity (ε) and conductivity (σ) values
as per the following frequency dispersion: 3  The effective permittivity
of cell (εc′*) is calculated
in the following iterative manner. First, the innermost layer of the
cell, i.e., the nucleus, and its surrounding envelope are approximated
and replaced by a sphere of the same size (nucleus radius plus thickness
of the nucleus membrane). The effective permittivity is expressed
in terms of the respective complex permittivities, εnucleus* and εnucEnvelope*, while “a” is the ratio of external (nucleus plus envelope) to internal
(nucleus) radius of the combined layers: 4  Next, the
same process is repeated until the
whole cell is replaced by a single sphere to consider the four-layer
spherical model (including nucleus, nuclear envelope, cytoplasm, and
cytoplasmic membrane). In this manner, the effective permittivity
of the nucleus layer in eq 4 is combined with its surrounding cytoplasm to give effective
cytoplasmic permittivity and with cell membrane to give effective
cell permittivity. On the basis of this, eq 2 is used to fit the experimental DEP response
of each cell modification. Parameters of the closest fit to the data
are used to represent dielectric properties of cell elements.Figure 1 Geometry of
the four-layer dielectric model (each layer with permittivity
or ε and conductivity or σ) that is used to fit the DEP
spectra, including membrane (σmem and εmem), cytoplasm (σcyto and εcyto), nuclear envelope (σNucEnvelope and εnucEnvelope), and nucleus (σnucleus and εnucleus).



Velocity Tracking To Quantify
DEP Force
To quantify
pDEP levels for cells with modified mitochondria, we used velocity
tracking18 on an electrodeless dielectrophoresis
platform.27,28 The lowest frequency showing obvious differences
in pDEP between cells with differing mitochondrial morphology was
chosen (0.5 MHz). Standard PDMS [poly(dimethylsiloxane)] micromolding
methods were used to fabricate diamond-shaped posts that serve as
sharp lateral constrictions in the channel (1000–70 μm).
This electrodeless DEP device was bonded using oxygen plasma treatment
to a glass coverslip for easy microscopic imaging of DEP behavior.
A flow field was used to place cells in the uniform field area. An
orthogonal electric field was then applied between Pt electrodes (100
Vpp/cm) at the frequency of interest, using a power amplifier.29 The trajectory of unlabeled polarized cells
(105/mL) from the region just outside the diamond post
(i.e., region of “no field gradient”) to the tip of
the diamond post (i.e., region of “highest field gradient”)
was recorded as high frame per second movies. On the basis of Newton’s
second law for a particle of mass m, the net dielectrophoretic
force (FDEP) on the accelerated particle
of radius R, within a medium of viscosity η,
can be determined by tracking displacement (x) as
a function of time (t) to obtain (dx/dt) and (d2x/dt2) for each genetic modification on the respective
cell types, as per 5  In this manner, FDEP levels under pDEP at the frequency of interest can be used to quantify
mitochondrial alterations to HEK cells.

Results and Discussion
Images
Analysis to Quantify Mitochondrial Structure
In order to
separate mitochondrial features from those of the nucleus,
we use color channeling, since they are differentially stained (see Supporting Information section S3). This is achieved
by maintaining one channel with each of RGB colors
at a particular time and detecting objects with that specific color,
followed by a decision tree to separate the features (Figure 2, part a vs b). Following this,
multiple preprocessing steps, including median, top-hat, and adaptive
wiener filtering are applied to remove noise and other imperfections
in the image. After preprocessing, an adaptive thresholding method
is used for segmentation of the mitochondrial network, to identify
individual mitochondria, as shown in Figure 2c. This structure is then used to identify
branches (individual mitochondrion) and branch points (mitochondrial
joints). Each branch is used as a mask to perform measurements such
as length, width, and area on each individual mitochondrion (Figure 2, part c vs d). The
connectedness factor (Cf) is a measure
of connectivity of the mitochondrial network based on its comparison
to an ideal network, as given by 6  Here, Bi is the number of branches in each connected
group in the mitochondrial
network of the cell, with the connected group representing a group
of two or more mitochondria that are connected together, and ni is the number of branch points
in the same connected group. Bideal is
the number of the branches within the fully connected ideal network,
as given by 7  As per the red dashed line in Figure 2d, the strength of a particular
connection for each mitochondrial component of the cell is defined
as Bini, where Bi is the number of branches in ith
component in the mitochondrial network of the cell and ni is the number of branch points in the
same component.

computing
a connectedness factor. (a) Color channeling on the image of the stained
cell followed by a decision tree is used to separate out the mitochondrial
features (b). Preprocessing steps followed by adaptive thresholding
is used for segmentation of the mitochondrial network to identify
individual mitochondria (c), for identifying branches (individual
mitochondrion) and branch points (mitochondrial joints). Each branch
is used as a mask to perform measurements such as length, width, and
area on each individual mitochondrion so that the connectedness factor
can be computed (eq 6), as indicated by the red dashed line in panel d.

Genetic Manipulation of Mitochondrial Morphology
HRas
is a proto-oncogene whose activation results in many downstream physiological
changes, including altered metabolism, increased proliferation, blunted
apoptosis, and changes in gene expression.30 In order to generate cell lines that exhibit significant differences
in mitochondrial morphology, but with minimal changes to other aspects
of cellular physiology, we carried out the following.

First,
we stably expressed a constitutively active version of HRas called
HRasG12V in immortalized HEK cells, which we previously demonstrated
to result in a highly fragmented mitochondrial network.12 Next, we stably expressed shRNA targeting either
Drp1 (HEK-RAS-12V-shDrp) or a scramble control sequence (HEK-RAS-12V-shScramble).
As expected, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Drp1 results in a complete
reversal of the mitochondrial fragmentation, indicating an extremely
interconnected phenotype (92% connectedness, Figure 3i). Conversely, expression of the scramble
control sequence had no effect on the HRas-induced mitochondrial fission,
thereby causing these cells to maintain a highly fragmented phenotype
(25% connectedness, Figure 3ii). Importantly, because we are directly targeting the mitochondrial
fission machinery (Drp1) in cells that start with a fragmented phenotype,
this approach allows us to generate two extreme mitochondrial phenotypes
(i.e., highly fragmented and highly connected) with minimal differences
in all other aspects of cellular physiology. Furthermore, we compare
these “extreme” mitochondrial morphologies using a different
cell type: mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) generated by a different
method, i.e., genetic knockout of the mitochondrial fission (Drp1)21 and fusion (Mfn1/2)31 machinery, respectively. Since Drp1 and MFN1/2 primarily influence
mitochondrial dynamics, their deletion should induce minimal changes
in overall cellular physiology, aside from mitochondrial fission and
fusion.32 We generated immortalized Drp1–/– MEFs by infecting cells isolated from Drp1flox/flox; TP53flox/flox embryos with adenoviral
Cre recombinase. As expected, due to their inability to perform mitochondrial
fission, these cells exhibit extreme mitochondrial connectedness (91%
connectedness, Figure 3iii). To generate the opposite phenotype, we obtained immortalized
Mfn1/Mfn2 double knockout cells that are deficient in mitochondrial
outer membrane fusion.31 As expected, these
MEFs exhibit highly fragmented mitochondrial network, due to unopposed
mitochondrial fission (17% connectedness, Figure 3iv). Notably, both sets of MEFs are from
the same strain of inbred mice (129/Sv) and both are p53 deficient
(Mfn1/2–/– MEFs express SV40 Large T-antigen,
which inhibits p5333). Hence, these cells
should exhibit minimal changes in overall physiology, independent
of mitochondrial morphology. In this manner, using two different cell
types and two separate methods to alter mitochondrial morphology,
we envision that the measured alterations to cellular physiology arise
solely due to mitochondrial phenotype, rather than due to off-target
changes associated with our method.

Figure 3 Fluorescent images of fixed cells using
anti-Tom20-labeling to
reveal mitochondrial (green and red for HEK and MEFs, respectively)
features (nucleus labeled blue). For mitochondrial features, the described
image analysis method is used to compute the number of branches, branch
area (in pixels), and connectedness factor as per eq 6, as indicated for each cell type.
Note that, while the respective fixed cells appear to differ in size
due to well-known interfacial interactions with the substrate, the
size variations of suspended cells are minimal based on flow cytometry
data (Supporting Information section).

Mitochondrial Phenotype-Induced
DEP Alterations
Modifications
to the mitochondrial structure influence cellular physiology, which
is measured in this work, based on alterations to cytoplasmic electrophysiology.
Each subcellular region dominates the DEP-induced cell polarizability
response over a particular frequency range, depending on the contributions
to its electrophysiology by the net conductivity and permittivity
dispersion.34 Hence, modifications to the
mitochondrial structure can be selectively probed based on alterations
to the DEP frequency response in the frequency region wherein the
electrophysiology due to mitochondrial structure dominates the net
polarizability dispersion. It is also noteworthy that a critical level
of media conductivity (σm) is required for optimal
distinction of alterations in DEP spectra for particular cell types
with differing mitochondrial connectedness. For instance, low σm levels enhance the contrast for discerning alterations in
crossover to pDEP behavior due to morphological modifications to the
cell envelope,35−37 which influence the respective permittivity values.
Similarly, as per the spectral simulations and data in Supporting Information section S4, relatively
higher σm levels that are closer to the conductivity
of the cytoplasm (σcyto) wherein the mitochondria
are situated should enable distinctions in mitochondrial phenotype.
In this manner, alterations in the cell DEP response can be indicative
of modifications to mitochondrial features, as long as the appropriate
σm level and DEP frequency range are chosen for these
comparisons. On the basis of this, the spectra are measured at σm of 0.15 S/m, since it is close to the anticipated range for
σcyto (0.5–1 S/m), while being low enough
for pDEP behavior (i.e., σcyto > σm). Comparing the DEP response of HEK-RAS-12V-shDrp (Figure 4a, part i) that exhibits a
highly connected mitochondrial structure (see Figure 3i) to that of HEK-RAS-12V-shScramble (Figure 4a, part ii) that
exhibits highly fragmented mitochondria (see Figure 3ii), the chief differences are in the 0.5–15
MHz region, as verified by a t test at each frequency
to confirm well-separated mean values at 95% significance level. The
DEP-well device used to measure these responses is shown in Figure 4b. Similarly, comparing
the DEP response of MEF-Drp-KO cells (Figure 4c, part iii) that exhibit a highly connected
mitochondrial structure (see Figure 3iii) versus MEF-Mfn-KO cells (Figure 4c, part iv) that exhibit a highly fragmented
mitochondrial structure (see Figure 3iv), it is apparent that the differences are in the
0.5–15 MHz region (verified by a t test at
each frequency to confirm separation at 95% significance level). In Supporting Information section S5, we present
additional controls comparing wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) MEF
cell lines with Drp1 and Mfn modifications. Interestingly, the mitochondrial
connectedness from image analysis, as well as based on pDEP levels
in 0.5−15 MHz region, show that the phenotypes for WT cells
lie between those of the respective KO cells. The differences in mitochondrial
features between Mfn-WT and Mfn-KO are slightly larger versus the
respective differences between Drp-KO and Drp-WT, which may be attributed
to the differing rates of the fusion versus fission processes. This
consistency further strengthens our inference that the pDEP measurements
are truly representative of differences in mitochondrial morphology
and not another aspect of cell physiology. It is noteworthy that DEP
spectra in the 0.5–15 MHz frequency range are dominated by
electrophysiology of the cell interior, wherein the mitochondria are
situated. Hence, the pDEP levels for cells with a highly connected
mitochondrial structure are consistently higher than those of cells
with a highly fragmented mitochondrial structure, considering both
cell types (HEK and MEFs) and independent of the method used to generate
the respective mitochondrial phenotype (knockdown vs knockout). Figure 4d shows some sample
images in the DEP-well device that are used to quantify varying DEP
levels versus frequency, based on the spatiotemporal profiles of light
scattering induced by DEP motion. Using a three-shell or four-layer
dielectric model (Materials and Methods section),
the respective spectra were fit to obtain dielectric properties for
each subcellular region of interest (Table 1). Comparing the fitted dielectric parameters,
it is apparent that an enhancement of mitochondrial connectivity increases
conductivity of the cell interior, as reflected by that of the cytoplasm
(σcyto) and nucleus envelope (σnucEnvelope). While Drp1 knockdown in HEK cells causes ∼70% higher σcyto levels and 3-fold higher σnucEnvelope levels, Drp1 knockout in MEFs causes ∼60% higher σcyto levels and 3-fold higher σnucEnvelope levels. Considering the two parameters, the influence of σcyto would likely dominate over that of σnucEnvelope, since σcyto is significantly higher (nearly 100-fold
higher than σnucEnvelope). Hence, increasing σcyto by 50–70% would substantially increase pDEP levels
in the 0.5–15 MHz, whereas a 3-fold rise in the substantially
lower conductivity parameter (σnucEnvelope) causes
only gradual alterations to slope of the DEP spectra in the 0.5–2
MHz region, especially at the chosen σm of 0.15 S/m
(≫σnucEnvelope).Figure 4 Dielectrophoretic frequency spectra of

measured at σm of 0.15 S/m in a 3DEP reader using
20 individual wells with ring electrodes (b) to measure relative DEP
force levels based on spatiotemporal variations in light scattering,
as per example images shown in panel d for nDEP at 150 kHz, no DEP
at 300 kHz, and pDEP at 3 MHz field frequencies.

Single-Cell Quantification of pDEP Trapping
Force Levels
The application of DEP toward frequency-selective
isolation of cells
based on their electrophysiology due to a particular mitochondrial
structure requires that there be significant differences in their
trapping force levels at optimal frequencies. While the DEP-well device
measures the force spectra over a wide frequency range (0.1–20
MHz) by quantifying spatiotemporal alterations in light scattering
due to the DEP motion of particles, it is an indirect method to measure
DEP force on particle ensembles, without considering the efficacy
of trapping forces for the purpose of DEP isolation at a particular
flow rate. Hence, in order to quantify the differences in pDEP force
levels between cells of differing mitochondrial structure, we use
velocity tracking methods to directly measure force levels with single-cell
sensitivity (details in the Materials and Methods section).

Specifically, we choose an electrodeless DEP device
configuration (Figure 5a) for these measurements, wherein the electric field is applied
orthogonal to fluid flow. This device is also significant to assess
feasibility for selective cell isolation based on mitochondrial structure,
since the spatial field nonuniformities created by constrictions due
to insulating posts can enable frequency-selective isolation of cells
at the constriction tips, based on magnitude of their pDEP levels
versus orthogonal drag force due to flow. Specifically, we choose
to compare HRas-modified HEK cells expressing shDrp versus those expressing
a shScramble sequence, to verify significant differences in pDEP for
cells with a highly connected versus a highly fragmented mitochondrial
structure. While significant differences in pDEP levels are obvious
for the respective spectra over the 0.5–15 MHz range in Figure 4a, we choose 0.5
MHz for these measurements, since power of the amplifier circuit that
is used to generate the field over a wide spatial extent degrades
at higher frequencies. On the basis of the images in Figure 5b, rapid pDEP trapping is apparent
in Figure 5b, parts
i–iii (video in the Supporting Information) for shDrp-expressing cells with a highly connected mitochondrial
structure exhibiting pDEP levels of 1 nN ± 15% based on 10 independent
single-cell measurements. The analogous measurement with HEK cells
expressing oncogenic HRasG12V plus a scramble control, as per pDEP
trapping images in Figure 5b, parts iv–vi, shows significantly lower pDEP levels
that are measured at 0.1 nN ± 25% (based on 10 independent single-cell
measurements). These results based on direct pDEP measurements on
single cells validate the spectral distinctions of Figure 4. Assuming a steady drop in
pDEP force across constriction region of the device, a flow rate of
∼1.35 μL/min is sufficient to ensure that the fluid velocity
on the cells is significantly higher than the drag force due to FpDEP at the 0.1 nN level, while being lower
than the drag force due to FpDEP at the
1 nN level (see Supporting Information section
S7 for parameters used for this calculation). On the basis of this
flow rate, a starting concentration of 105 cells/mL can
be enriched for cells with the higher FpDEP, at a rate of ∼100 cells/min, to
enable frequency-selective cell isolation at 0.5 MHz based on the
cytoplasmic conductivity due to its mitochondrial features.

is applied at t = 0 and shows substantial pDEP levels
for cells Ras-expressing HEK cells with shDrp modification (1 nN ±
15%) vs with shScramble modification (0.1 nN ± 25%), presumably
due to their differences mitochondrial morphology. See the DEP movie
in the Supporting Information.

Conclusions
Alterations in connectivity
of the intracellular mitochondrial
network after select genetic modifications can be quantified based
on changes in the intracellular cytoplasmic conductivity, which is
determined by fitting dielectrophoretic spectra of the respective
cells to a standard shell dielectric model. This label-free DEP quantification
method is highly consistent with image analysis methods to quantify
the mitochondrial network of labeled cells. Specifically, direct inhibition
of mitochondrial fission through shRNA-mediated knockdown of Drp1
increases the cytoplasmic conductivity by ∼70% in human embryonic
kidney cells and a full genetic knockout of Drp1 in mouse embryonic
fibroblasts causes a 60% rise in cytoplasmic conductivity over cells
deficient for mitochondrial fusion. Utilizing a frequency of 0.5 MHz,
we demonstrate that human embryonic kidney cells with a highly connected
mitochondrial network exhibit ∼10-fold higher trapping forces
under positive dielectrophoresis versus those with a highly fragmented
mitochondrial network. On the basis of this, we envision a label-free
platform for frequency-selective cell isolation to transform the discovery
process, both for small-molecule modulators of the mitochondrial dynamics
machinery and for novel signaling pathways that regulate the machinery
under a variety of physiological conditions.
