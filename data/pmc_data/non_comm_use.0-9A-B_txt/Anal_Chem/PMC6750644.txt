Comprehensive
and time-dependent information (e.g., chemical composition,
concentration) of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in atmospheric,
indoor, and breath air is essential to understand the fundamental
science of the atmosphere, air quality, and diseases diagnostic. Here,
we introduced a fully automated online dynamic in-tube extraction
(ITEX)–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method
for continuous and quantitative monitoring of VOCs in air. In this
approach, modified Cycle Composer software and a PAL autosampler controlled
and operated the ITEX preconditioning, internal standard (ISTD) addition,
air sampling, and ITEX desorption sequentially to enable full automation.
Air flow passed through the ITEX with the help of an external pump,
instead of plunger up–down strokes, to allow larger sampling
volumes, exhaustive extraction, and consequently lower detection limits.
Further, in order to evaluate the ITEX system stability and to develop
the corresponding quantitative ITEX method, two laboratory-made permeation
systems (for standard VOCs and ISTD) were constructed. The stability
and suitability of the developed system was validated with a consecutive
19 day atmospheric air campaign under automation. By using an electrospun
polyacrylonitrile nanofibers packed ITEX, selective extraction of
some VOCs and durability of over 1500 extraction and desorption cycles
were achieved. Especially, the latter step is critically important
for on-site long-term application at remote regions. This ITEX method
provided 2–3 magnitudes lower quantitation limits than the
headspace dynamic ITEX method and other needle trap methods. Our results
proved the excellence of the fully automated online dynamic ITEX–GC/MS
system for tracking VOCs in the atmospheric air.

==== Body
Identification and quantitation
of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in air is essential to understand
the fundamental science of the atmosphere, air quality, and disease
diagnostics. Ubiquitously present VOCs in atmospheric air are reactive
with atmospheric oxidants (e.g., ·OH, ·NO3, or
O3) and form water-soluble organic compounds which can
further promote the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs)
or are eliminated by wet deposition.1,2 SOAs further
influence Earth’s climate by directly scattering/absorbing
sunlight or acting as cloud/ice condensation nuclei which change the
cloud microphysical and optical properties.3,4 In
addition, some VOCs, which exist not only in outdoor but also in indoor
air, have adverse health effects on humans especially at high concentration
levels.5 Profiling the VOCs in air exhaled
by patients has been explored for noninvasive diagnostics of cancers
and benign diseases.6−8

Owing to the reactivity of VOCs and time-dependent
alteration of
VOC concentrations, on-site sampling and measurement of VOCs have
become a trend.5,9 Full automation and uninterrupted
long-term measurement are also critical aspects which are meaningful,
especially for atmospheric researchers who process their studies in
remote regions, e.g., boreal forests and rural areas.10,11

Typically, passive or active sampling of VOCs with an air
sampler
followed by thermal desorption (TD) and consequent gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry (GC/MS) determination is the most frequently performed
strategy. Equilibrium-based devices, solid-phase microextraction (SPME)
in its diverse formats,12−15 sorbent-coated disks and membranes16 have been widely utilized as passive air samplers thanks
to their easy operation and cost-effectiveness, but unfortunately
with the difficulties in quantitation.16 On the contrary, active air sampling is perceived as the most accurate
quantitative technique due to its exhaustive characteristic.16 Further, it is more time-efficient for gaining
informative results in a period of time. A sorbent-packed trap is
the conventional format of an active air sampler.17 Recently, Romano et al. employed commercial TD tubes coupled
to proton-transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-TOF-MS)
for 24 h of measurement of biomarkers in exhaled air samples.18 Pawliszyn’s group has reported a series
of miniaturized sorbent traps, named as needle trap (NT) devices,
for air sampling.19 In our group, a commercial
NT device was successfully used with a portable GC/MS for on-site
measurement of biogenic and anthropogenic VOCs at a boreal forest.20 But fully automated operation of entire sampling
and measurement procedures is strictly restricted to these devices.
For instance, Gong et al.21 and Mieth et
al.22,23 have reported several automated NT methods,
but automation was achieved only in desorption and determination steps.
In addition, Sanchez et al. designed and utilized several multilayer
sorbent-packed tubes and laboratory-made configurations for online
sampling and analysis of breath and environmental air.24−28 However, manual operations were still needed and the applicability
of the systems for nonstop long-term measurements was not demonstrated.
Another similar configuration, including a dual-adsorbent preconcentrator,29,30 has experienced the same challenge. Currently, sensors31 and PTR-MS32 have
become the routine tools for air monitoring with direct and real-time
measurements. But the former need the enhancement in selectivity and
sensitivity and the latter in separation and identification of isomers,
although greatly improved in the past decade.

On the basis of
the aforementioned context, the in-tube extraction
(ITEX) technique is an excellent choice to meet the requirement in
terms of the simultaneous integration of full automation, continuous
air sampling and analysis, long-term sampling, and the possibility
for quantitation. By coupling an autosampler to the ITEX device, full
automation and uninterrupted measurement can be achieved. An ITEX
device packed with a large amount of sorbent allows exhaustive sampling
and quantitative analysis of VOCs. In addition, ITEX meets well the
reliability and stability requirements, which are particularly important
for long-term application.33

Further,
efficient and selective sorbent materials are desired
for ITEX devices. The suitability of particulate and fibrous adsorbent
as the packing materials of needle-shaped devices has been well-evaluated
and demonstrated.19,34 Nanofibers with appropriate permeability
and porosity are promising alternative packing sorbents for ITEX,35 and recently organic and inorganic nanofibers
have been available as directly electrospun or indirectly calcined
electrospun nanofibers with additional inorganic precursors.35,36

In this research, an online dynamic ITEX–GC/MS method
was
developed which integrated the air sampling and measurement steps
under full automation and was applicable for long-term monitoring
of VOCs without any human involvement and interruption. For this aim,
the autosampler and its software were modified to allow the fully
automated ITEX movements (including ITEX preconditioning, internal
standard (ISTD) addition, air sampling, and desorption) in online
dynamic sampling and GC/MS analysis. Two reliable laboratory-made
permeation systems were designed and constructed for ITEX testing
and method development. Further, ITEX traps packed with different
fibrous and particulate adsorbents were tested in terms of extraction
performance.

Nanofibers
Preparation and ITEX Packing
Polyacrylonitrile
(PAN) nanofibers were electrospun from a 5, 7.5, and 10 wt % PAN/dimethylformamide
(DMF) solution (named 5%, 7.5%, and 10% PAN).37 For electrospinning, 2.5 mL of each solution was pushed through
a stainless-steel needle with a 15 kV voltage at 0.5 mL h–1 and collected on a grounded 8 in. silicon wafer. ZnO and ZIF-8/ZnO
nanofibers were prepared as previously reported.36 First, 1 g of Zn(NO3)2·4H2O in 2 mL of deionized water was mixed with 4.5 mL of DMF
and 7.5 mL of a beforehand prepared 18 wt % poly(vinylpyrrolidone)/ethanol
solution. The mixture was electroblown into nanofibers and calcined
in air at 500 °C for 4 h, and then converted to ZIF-8/ZnO nanofibers
by thermal treatment with 2-methylimidazole vapor. Porous ZnO nanofibers
were prepared by annealing ZIF-8/ZnO nanofibers at 500 °C for
15 min in air. The aforementioned materials were then packed into
ITEXs individually: 20 mg of deactivated silica wool, 50 mg of adsorbent,
20 mg of deactivated silica wool, and a stainless-steel spring were
sequentially packed for the first time. Before extraction, each ITEX
was preconditioned with nitrogen at 250 °C for 12 h.

ITEX Selection
Optimal ITEX sorbent material for extraction
of VOCs was selected after comparing laboratory-made and commercial
ITEXs under dynamic headspace extraction mode. Sample extraction,
desorption, and injection were controlled and operated by the PAL
Cycle Composer (CTC Analytics) and PAL RTC autosampler with the manufacture’s
original program. An amount of 5 mL of standard mixture (1 μg
mL–1) with 2 g of NaCl was placed in a 20 mL headspace
vial. The ITEX trap was preconditioned with nitrogen for 10 min at
250 °C accompanied by the sample incubation (10 min at 40 °C).
Then, the trap temperature was set to 40 °C and syringe temperature
to 60 °C. Twenty strokes (defined as the number of plunger up–down
movements) of 1 mL of headspace sample at a flow rate of 100 μL
s–1 were used. After the extraction, 1.2 mL of helium
was aspirated from the injector and analytes were injected with 200
μL s–1 after the trap was heated to 250 °C.
Triplicate measurements were performed with each ITEX.

Permeation
Systems for Online Dynamic ITEX
The permeation
system comprised two operation modes: standard VOCs and air sampling
(Figure 1). The first
mode provided constant gas flow of VOCs for online dynamic ITEX calibration
and method development (Figure 1a). Pure chemicals were first capped into commercial GC sample
vials individually, and then placed in a metal cylinder and kept at
30 °C in an oven. A slow nitrogen flow (2 mL min–1) was introduced into the metal cylinder from one end and mixed with
constantly vaporized analytes and exited from the other end of the
cylinder. In order to decrease the sample concentration, the sample
flow was diluted by an extra nitrogen flow (6 L min–1), and the combined flow was guided to the modified extraction port
of the autosampler. Copper tubing was used as the sampling and connection
lines due to its low memory effect for the analytes when compared
to polymeric tubes. It could be completely cleaned by flushing with
nitrogen for a few hours. The sampling line length was shorter than
1 m in order to reduce the adsorption. The second mode was for air
sampling, and the total diluted standard flow from the permeation
system was replaced by an air flow (Figure 1b).

Figure 1 Schematic of the fully automated online dynamic
ITEX system consisting
three steps: (1) preconditioning, (2) ISTD extraction, and (3) standard
sampling. The system was employed for (a) online dynamic ITEX calibration
and method development or (b) air sampling.

The permeation system for the ISTD was similar to the above-described
system (Figure 1a).
In a GC vial insert tube, 10 mg of decafluorobiphenyl was capped and
placed in a 20 mL headspace vial. A nitrogen flow (216 mL min–1) was introduced to flush the vaporized ISTD (at 40
°C) to the ISTD extraction port (see Movie 1).

Online Dynamic ITEX Procedures for Air Sampling
The
controlling software, PAL Cycle Composer, was modified to allow its
operation with two different extraction steps, first with the ISTD,
and then with air sample. The PAL autosampler was modified to allow
dynamic sampling. A laboratory-made mechanical switch was used to
automatically open and close (with an electronic controller) the gas
valves used to select between air sampling and nitrogen flow (Figure 1a). The ISTD addition
step was processed before sampling by 1 stroke (1 mL with 100 μL
s–1 aspirating speed) from the ISTD extraction port.
Then, the ITEX was moved to the air/standard sampling port. The atmospheric
air was introduced to the sampling port from a lab window by the corrugated
aluminum ducting hose (i.d. 10 cm) which was purchased from a local
hardware store at Helsinki, Finland. The tube was placed under the
sampling port, and the ITEX needle penetrated the tube during air
sampling. At the same time, the plunger of the ITEX syringe was lifted
up and positioned above the side hole of the syringe by the software.
Then, the mechanical switch triggered the electronic controller to
close the nitrogen line and open the line to the air pump (ASF Thomas
Industries GmbH, Germany), and air started to pass continuously through
the adsorbent due to the vacuum made by the membrane pump connected
to the end of the gas line of the ITEX. Trap and syringe temperatures
during the sampling were 30 and 40 °C, respectively. After sampling
and closing the line to the air pump, helium (800 μL) was aspirated
from the GC inlet and analytes were desorbed (240 °C) and injected
into GC/MS by moving the plunger down (100 μL s–1). After desorption, the nitrogen line was opened for ITEX preconditioning.
Sampling was done at 200 mL min–1 for 90 min in
the campaign in July 2018 and indoor air sampling, 200 mL min–1 for 10 min in the exhaled air sampling, and 56 mL
min–1 for 30 min in the campaign in November 2018,
respectively.

Results and Discussion
The applicability
of laboratory-made inorganic and organic nanofibers
and commercial particulate adsorbents was first compared for the extraction
of VOCs with a wide range of chemical properties. Then, a fully automated,
fast, and convenient online dynamic ITEX method was developed with
laboratory-made permeation systems and electronic ITEX flow controller,
modified software, and autosampler. The stability and applicability
of the developed method was validated with atmospheric air sampling.
After optimization, the whole approach was applied for quantitative
monitoring of VOCs in atmospheric air.

Selection of the Packing
Material for ITEX
VOCs contained
in the atmosphere have a wide range of polarity, volatility, and molecular
mass at trace-level concentrations. Thus, a proper packing material
for the ITEX device to allow air to easily flow through and efficiently
capture VOCs with selectivity, if required, has become a key point.
The permeability of commercial (Tenax TA, Tenax GR, Tenax TA/Carbosieve
S-III, Carbosieve S-III, and Carboxen 1000) and laboratory-made (10%
PAN, ZnO, porous ZnO, and ZIF-8/ZnO nanofibers) sorbents (Figure 2) in ITEX were tested
by simply connecting the individual ITEX device to a membrane pump
and measuring the flow rate at the tip of the ITEX needle. There were
no clear differences between the commercial and laboratory-made ITEXs,
∼220 and ∼200 mL min–1 for the former
and latter, respectively, which indicated the good suitability of
nanofibers as ITEX sorbent material for fast air sampling.

ZnO, and (g and h) ZnO/ZIF-8 core/shell nanofibers with two magnifications,
×10k (left side images) and ×100k (right side images).

The laboratory-made ITEXs were
processed for the extraction of
selected template compounds (Table S-1).
The ITEX tube, packed with polymeric PAN nanofibers (PAN-ITEX), exhibited
the best extraction affinity to most analytes (Figure 3a), mainly due to the amine and imide group
rich surface of PAN nanofibers. However, ZnO-ITEX had excellent affinity
and selectivity toward amines and hydrocarbons but extracted only
slightly other types of compounds (Figure 3a). ZnO nanofibers gained extra specific
surface area after annealing (porous ZnO nanofibers) and resulted
in better extraction performance toward all the analytes, being still
weaker compared to PAN nanofibers. Among the laboratory-made nanofibers,
ZIF-8/ZnO nanofibers demonstrated the lowest interactivity with template
VOCs due to their inaccessible cavities (∼1 nm)36 and lack of analytes containing a benzene ring
for π–π interaction with them. Between ZnO and
ZIF-8/ZnO nanofibers, the former exhibited better porosity compared
to the latter (Figure 2), which resulted in their higher extraction capacity. As a conclusion,
surface functional groups in the nanofibers played a major role in
determining the extraction affinity toward the selected VOCs studied.
Further, the viscosity of the PAN/DMF solution decided the morphologies
of PAN nanofibers (Figure S-1) and thereby
the extraction performance (Figure 3b).

Figure 3 (a–c) Comparison of different ITEXs for the extraction
of
11 groups of VOCs.

Compared to five commercial
ITEX sorbent materials, 10% PAN-ITEX
exhibited better extraction affinity to alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones
and comparable with Tenax TA-ITEX toward sulfides (Figure 3c). The latter had an exceptional
selectivity toward amines. Carbosieve S-III and Carboxen 1000 ITEXs
had the worst extraction affinity to template VOCs. Multilayer ITEXs
packed with Tenax TA and Carbosieve S-III were the most universal
commercial ITEXs and showed similar extraction coverage to 10% PAN-ITEX.
After considering the ITEX permeability, extraction coverage, and
capacity to the studied VOCs, 10% PAN-ITEX was selected for further
studies.

Reusability and Reproducibility of 10% PAN-ITEX
Since
the 10% PAN-ITEX device was constructed for long-term nonstop measurements,
its reusability affected the lifetime of the whole system in use.
Because the 10% PAN-ITEX had an excellent extraction affinity to alcohols,
aldehydes, nitriles, and sulfides, therefore, a few analytes from
each group were selected for the experiments in this section (Figure S-2). The 10% PAN-ITEX could be used for
over 1500 extraction and desorption cycles, which indicated its suitability
for long-term air monitoring. On the other hand, the excellent reproducibility
of 10% PAN-ITEX [average relative standard deviation (RSD) of 15 compounds
in terms of peak area was 9.7%] (Figure S-2) decreased the need for calibration renewal if the ITEX used happened
to be accidently broken and the replacement with a new one was needed.

Tests for the Permeation and ITEX Systems
Prior to
ITEX method development, the applicability of permeation systems for
standard VOCs and ISTD was validated with 14 model compounds (Table S-2), which are widely distributed in the
atmosphere in Helsinki,38 and ISTD decafluorobiphenyl,
which (1) does not exist in the atmosphere, (2) does not cause any
interferences to analysis results, (3) is not reactive with other
analytes, (4) can be easily adsorbed by 10% PAN-ITEX, and (5) has
a different retention time with that of other compounds.

First,
the 10% PAN-ITEX was used to extract VOCs from the standard permeation
system for 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min. For triplicate
measurements with each extraction time, RSDs ranged from 0.26% to
3.2% for 14 compounds, which revealed that the permeation system provided
constant VOCs contained gas flow and very good repeatability of the
10% PAN-ITEX device. The ISTD permeation system showed excellent repeatability
with an RSD of only 2.1% (22 extractions), which ensures the accurate
and equivalent ISTD addition in the ITEX before every sampling cycle.

The reliability and stability of the fully automated online dynamic
ITEX system for a long-term application was then tested by performing
a consecutive 19 day campaign from the 12th to 30th of July, 2018
at Kumpula Campus, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. Totally
207 sampling and measurements cycles were successfully processed without
any interruption. If needed, this system could be used for a longer
campaign. Previous studies which were based upon NT,21 sorption tube,26,27 and TD tube devices18 coupled to GC/MS or PTR-TOF-MS only provided
semiautomated methods. In addition, multi-TD devices18 were needed in order to achieve high-throughput analysis,
which is not likely to guarantee the excellent result repeatability
and reproducibility. During the campaign, concentration alterations
of representative α-pinene, δ-3-carene, and p-cymene are shown in Figure 4, and those of the rest of the 11 VOCs of interest are in Figure S-3. Three representative chromatograms
are shown in Figure S-4a.

Figure 4 Variation of α-pinene,
δ-3-carene, and p-cymene concentrations in
atmospheric air of Kumpula Campus in July
2018, using the 10% PAN-ITEX–GC/MS method. The Y axis is the relative peak area of analyte (relative to ISTD).

The feasibility of the developed
system was further evaluated by
sampling indoor and exhaled air. Most of the VOCs (Table S-3) detected from the indoor air were also found in
the atmospheric air due to the ventilation system of the building
which filled outdoor air into the laboratory. So, it is logical that
the components of the indoor and outdoor air are partly the same.
Furthermore, some other VOCs which are commonly used in chemistry
laboratories were also detected, such as ethyl acetate, chloroform,
and pyridine. The successful analysis of the exhaled air indicated
the system suitability for sampling of high-humidity air (Figure S-4b).

Optimization of the Extraction
and Desorption Conditions
Air flow rate in active sampler
affects the sample throughput and
also the extraction yield.19,39 Three flow rates, 35,
56, and 200 mL min–1, were evaluated with 10% PAN-ITEX.
The flow rates >200 or <35 mL min–1 were not
considered because they either risk the tightness of the sorbent bed
or lead to lower method sensitivity. Model compounds, toluene, δ-3-carene,
and nonanal, represented the high-, medium-, and low-volatility compounds,
respectively. The breakthrough time at different flow rates was derived
from the bending point in each curve. With the highest flow rate,
breakthrough happened fast when sampling medium to high volatility
VOCs (Figure 5, parts
a and b) because high air velocity in the ITEX tube (1) increased
longitudinal dispersion of analytes in the sorbent bed and (2) decreased
interaction time between analytes and sorbent.19,39 With slower flow rates of 56 and 35 mL min–1,
breakthrough occurred at 30 and 40 min for toluene, 30 and 40 min
for δ-3-carene, and 30 and 50 min for nonanal, respectively.
So, a flow rate below 56 mL min–1 and sampling time
less than 30 min was the safest combination to eliminate analyte losses
during air sampling and to maintain quantitative conditions. Further,
the retention of ISTD in the ITEX tube should also be considered.
ISTD started to flow out almost immediately with the flow rate of
200 mL min–1. With flow rates of 56 and 35 mL min–1, the ISTD was retained about 30 and almost 90 min,
respectively (Figure 5d). Furthermore, total sampling volume and time will affect the sensitivity
and sampling throughput of the ITEX method. After considering the
quantitation, sensitivity, and time resolution of the ITEX method,
sampling at 56 mL min–1 for 30 min was performed
during a campaign in November 2018. The optimal flow rate (56 mL min–1) and total sampling volume (1.68 L) in this study
were similar to those of commercial adsorbent-packed tubes38,40 and sorption traps24−26,28 but much larger than
that of NT devices.19 Concentrations of
three model compounds in these tests were higher than those in the
atmospheric air during the campaign, which makes breakthrough even
less likely to occur. Further, triplicate measurements were performed
for each flow rate with each sampling time. Due to the small RSD values
(≤5.9%), error bars are invisible in Figure 5. This is why the original data is also listed
in Table S-4.

Figure 5 Breakthrough time of
(a) toluene, (b) δ-3-carene, (c) nonanal,
and (d) ISTD for 10% PAN-ITEX with 200, 56, and 35 mL min–1 flow rate. ITEX trap temperature, syringe temperature, desorption
temperature, desorption volume, and injection speed of desorption
gas were 30 °C, 40 °C, 240 °C, 800 μL helium,
and 100 μL s–1, respectively. Definition of
ratio (%) in panel d: the peak area of first extraction was set as
100%, and the ratio was the peak area of other extractions relative
to the first extraction × 100.

The following five parameters, ITEX trap temperature, syringe
temperature,
desorption temperature, desorption volume, and injection speed of
desorption gas, which can be adjusted in the PAL Cycle Composer, were
evaluated to clarify their effect on extraction yield and carryover.

Most of the compounds showed optimal extraction yields at 30 °C
(lowest possible temperature of the ITEX), which can be easily explained
by thermodynamic theory (Figure S-5a).41 The ITEX syringe temperature had a similar effect
as the ITEX trap temperature on the extraction yield (i.e., higher
temperatures decreased the extraction yield) (Figure S-5b). In order to avoid the water condensation in
the syringe needle during the air sampling, the syringe temperature
was therefore slightly higher than the trap temperature (40 °C).
Desorption temperature had a positive influence on the extraction
yield for most of the compounds (Figure S-5c). Because the PAN nanofibers were thermally stable up to 285 °C
(Figure S-6), and in order to increase
the reusability of PAN-ITEX, 240 °C was selected as the optimal
desorption temperature. When the helium volume used for desorption
was increased from 200 to 800 μL (Figure S-5d), extraction yield increased to the highest level. No
changes were observed with higher desorption gas volumes. Injection
speed had no obvious effect on extraction yield, and 100 μL
s–1 was selected after taking desorption time and
plunger lifetime into consideration (Figure S-5e).

In summary, the following optimal conditions were selected:
ITEX
flow rate, 56 mL min–1; extraction time, 30 min;
ITEX trap temperature, 30 °C; syringe temperature, 40 °C;
desorption temperature, 240 °C; desorption volume, 800 μL;
injection speed, 100 μL s–1.

Method Validation
For validation of the developed online
dynamic ITEX–GC/MS method, the concentrations of the analytes
in the permeation system were calculated from eq 1: 1  where M1 and M2 are the masses of a standard VOC vial before
and after a certain time of permeation and V is the
total gas volume flowed through the system between the M1 and M2 mass
measurements. Liquid syringe injection of the same mass of compound
as collected by the ITEX from the permeation system confirmed the
accuracy of the calculated analyte concentration in the permeation
system (an example is shown in Figure S-7). The small gap between them was caused by the unstable VOCs gas
flow at the beginning and was negligible after the permeation system
was given several days to stabilize. Further, the linear range, method
limit of quantitation (LOQ), and linearity of the developed method
were determined (Table 1).

Table 1 Analytical Performance of the Online
Dynamic 10% PAN-ITEX–GC/MS Method
analyte	LOQ (pg L–1)	linear range (pg L–1)	correlation coefficient (R2)	
toluene	25	30–1990	0.9951	
p-xylene	25	30–2720	0.9989	
benzaldehyde	120	120–19400	0.9959	
acetophenone	120	120–10100	0.9914	
1,2,3-trimethylbenzene	80	80–19200	0.9970	
Analytes selected for method
validation were those representative
compounds that existed in atmospheric air in November 2018. Five out
of nine compounds were quantified because toluene, p-xylene, and 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene represented the aromatic compounds
with one, two and three methyl groups, respectively. Benzaldehyde
and acetophenone represented the aldehyde group and ketone group,
respectively. Calibration curves, six data points (N = 3), of the compounds were obtained by 10% PAN-ITEX extraction
of individual analytes from the standard permeation system using different
extraction times. The concentrations of toluene, p-xylene, 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene, benzaldehyde, and acetophenone used
for method validation were 70, 65, 192, 290, and 61 pg L–1, respectively. LOQ (air concentration) was calculated by 10 times
the signal-to-noise ratio. Because of the large volume sampling, the
developed method exhibited exceptional sensitivity which is 2–3
magnitudes better than with dynamic headspace ITEX methods and dynamic
NT methods (Table S-5).19,42,43 The method sensitivity is also comparable
with that of sorbent tubes, which need 4 times more adsorbent material
than the laboratory-made ITEX (Table S-5).38,40 Further, LOQs reached the requirement for
quantitation of natural or anthropogenic VOCs in atmospheric air.38,40,44 RSDs of calibration curves for
all the analytes were below 7.6% dedicating the good precision of
the developed method, being comparable to those of other ITEX methods.42,43 All calibration curves showed good linearity with correlation coefficients
from 0.9914 to 0.9989. Total analysis time was only 55 min for each
sample.

Atmospheric Air Monitoring
Quantitative monitoring
of VOCs in atmospheric air was carried out from the 12th to 19th of
November, 2018 (Kumpula Campus, University of Helsinki, Helsinki,
Finland), and 189 sampling and measurement cycles were successfully
performed. The weather information shown in Figure S-8b was collected from Finnish Meteorological Institute Web
site (http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/past-30-day-weather).

Amounts of hydrocarbons, toluene, p-xylene, and
1,2,3-trimethylbenzene regularly varied from daytime to nighttime
which was attributed to high human activities (Figure 6a–c and Figure S-4c). Their concentrations ranged from 0.07 to 1.3, 0.13–2.2,
and 0.03–1.1 ng L–1, respectively (Figure 6a–c), which
were in the same concentration magnitude as reported in the literature.38,40 However, all of them were at a low concentration level in the rainy
days and several days after that because of the cleaning effect of
rain in the atmospheric air. In this research, benzaldehyde exhibited
relatively constant concentration during the campaign (5.3–14.1
ng L–1) due to its long lifetime (74 h) in the atmosphere
with OH radicals (5.3 × 105 molecules cm–3) (Figure 6d).45 Acetophenone is generated by HOOH photoformation
of phenol, and its concentration was 2.7–7.5 ng L–1 (Figure 6e).46 Interestingly, phenol was also detected in this
research (not quantified). Ethylbenzene, o-xylene,
and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene were identified as well and shown in Figure S-4c.

air of Kumpula Campus:
(a) toluene, (b) p-xylene, (c) 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene,
(d) benzaldehyde, and (e) acetophenone in November 2018, using the
10% PAN-ITEX–GC/MS method.

Conclusions
In this study, a fully automated online
dynamic ITEX–GC/MS
system was developed for the monitoring of atmospheric air. The VOCs
in the air were identified and quantified. The combination of modified
autosampler software, additional membrane pump, and modified sampler
platform enabled the automated online dynamic sampling and analysis.
The ITEX device packed with electrospun 10% PAN nanofibers showed
(1) good permeability due to the uniform diameter of fibers, (2) the
highest extraction affinity toward a wide range of VOCs compared to
other laboratory-made and commercial ITEX materials thanks to the
rich surface functional groups of the packing material, and (3) long
lifetime. These advantages are meaningful in a long-term application
of the monitoring system as they allow reliable sampling/extraction
and time-saving operation without any need to frequently replace the
extraction device. Laboratory-made standard VOCs and ISTD permeation
systems allowed reliable calibration and quantitation. Liquid standard
injection could be also used for the ITEX calibration. The developed
and validated method was automated and stable, and it gave picogram
per liter level limits of quantitation for the VOCs studied. The system
has a great potential for continuous on-site monitoring of VOCs in
air for all year round at the remote regions. Stations for Measuring
Ecosystem–Atmosphere Relations (SMEAR) (https://www.atm.helsinki.fi/SMEAR/index.php), e.g., provide well-constructed laboratories, equipment, electricity,
and carrier gas, etc., for measurements. By coupling this system with
fast separation and detection instruments (e.g., fast GC/MS), higher
time resolution of measurements can be achieved.
