Due
to its high spatiotemporal resolution, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry
(FSCV) at carbon-fiber microelectrodes enables the localized in vivo
monitoring of subsecond fluctuations in electroactive neurotransmitter
concentrations. In practice, resolution of the analytical signal relies
on digital background subtraction for removal of the large current
due to charging of the electrical double layer as well as surface
faradaic reactions. However, fluctuations in this background current
often occur with changes in the electrode state or ionic environment,
leading to nonspecific contributions to the FSCV data that confound
data analysis. Here, we both explore the origin of such shifts seen
with local changes in cations and develop a model to account for their
shape. Further, we describe a convolution-based method for removal
of the differential capacitive contributions to the FSCV current.
The method relies on the use of a small-amplitude pulse made prior
to the FSCV sweep that probes the impedance of the system. To predict
the nonfaradaic current response to the voltammetric sweep, the step
current response is differentiated to provide an estimate of the system’s
impulse response function and is used to convolute the applied waveform.
The generated prediction is then subtracted from the observed current
to the voltammetric sweep, removing artifacts associated with electrode
impedance changes. The technique is demonstrated to remove select
contributions from capacitive characteristics changes of the electrode
both in vitro (i.e., in flow-injection analysis) and in vivo (i.e.,
during a spreading depression event in an anesthetized rat).

Electrochemistry
provides a
method for the real-time in vivo detection of redox-active neurotransmitters.
Refinement of voltammetry for this purpose has enabled evaluation
of their localized concentration dynamics in awake and behaving animals.1−5 Cyclic voltammograms allow assignment of the signals to specific
neurotransmitters and thus permit selective tracking in the complex
extracellular environment. However, compared to amperometric techniques,
the use of voltammetry comes at the cost of sensitivity and time resolution.6 To compensate, high scan rates are used (i.e.,
fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, or FSCV) which, while making in vivo
detection practical, amplify other sources of current (e.g., the capacitive
charging current and surface faradaic reactions).7 These interferences dwarf the analytical signal and are
one of the primary sources of noise.

For these reasons, FSCV
data analysis typically employs digital
subtraction of the background using the current measured before the
neurobiological phenomena of interest.8 This method is effective for signal isolation given background stability.
However, if neurotransmitter release is accompanied by factors that
affect the background, the subtracted data contain artifacts. At the
scan rates typically used (e.g., hundreds of volts per second), a
significant double-layer charging current exists.9 The magnitude and shape of this charging current and the
presence of any background faradaic current strongly depend on the
electrode material and its environment. Carbon fibers are the most
common electrode material used for in vivo voltammetry.10 These fibers are known to have a diverse array
of surface functional groups, particularly oxygen-containing ones.11 These moieties are critical in determining the
electrode responses seen in FSCV (i.e., capacitive behavior, electrocatalytic
properties, and adsorption).12−14 Further, a subset is known to
be electroactive, generating peaks in the background voltammograms.15−18 Interactions with the carbon surface, through either adsorption
or involvement in surface reactions, may alter these responses and
contribute to the background-subtracted voltammograms. Indeed, nonfaradaic
and faradaic currents have been seen in background-subtracted voltammograms
taken during pH changes, as H+ plays a critical role in
the redox reaction of surface-bound, quinone-like species and appears
to alter the double layer.15,17−19 Additionally, an array of nonelectroactive species, including metal
cations (e.g., Ca2+) and organic molecules, has been shown
to adsorb to carbon microelectrodes, generating signals attributable
to double-layer alteration.12,18,20 These latter signals are largely nonspecific, limiting their analytical
utility.

A number of methods have been explored to deal with
these background
currents with fast-scan voltammetric data analysis. Early attempts
by Millar and colleagues relied on the use of alternative waveforms
(multiple triangular cycles or sine waves) aimed at exploiting the
differential response of faradaic and nonfaradaic current to repeated
sweep applications or voltage shifts.21−23 Later, Fourier domain
analysis was attempted, relying on the unique spectral signatures
of the nonfaradaic current for its identification and removal.24,25 Such approaches, while useful, typically required changes in the
measurement protocol, complicating analysis of the voltammetric signal
of interest. For direct analysis of multicomponent FSCV data, principal
component regression has also been employed with incorporation of
pH and background changes into the model to study dopamine concentration
changes over extended time windows.26−28 However, this approach
requires consistency of signal shape over time and is poorly characterized
for ionic interferences. More recently, Atcherley et al. showed successful
measurement of basal levels of dopamine using fast-scan controlled
adsorption voltammetry, which relies on the use of previously measured
CVs in conjunction with convolution for minimization of the nonfaradaic
current.29 Additionally, Yoshimi and Weitemier
also reported on the use of chronoamperometry to separate temporally
the nonfaradaic currents due to pH changes from the faradaic currents
of dopamine oxidation.20

Here, we
build on this prior work to explore the origin of the
background current seen at carbon-fiber microelectrodes and develop
a novel method for its mitigation. First, the specific FSCV signals
seen during local ion concentration changes (e.g., those of the major
cations found in extracellular solutions and FSCV calibration buffers,
K+, Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+) are revisited. This information is used to build a model of the
double layer that can qualitatively account for the observed CV shapes.
Further, we introduce a procedure for the prediction and removal of
the nonfaradaic component of the background signal that does not require
considerable changes to the measurement protocol. The method utilizes
an approach similar to that suggested by Yoshimi and Weitemier in
which a small amplitude step is paired with each FSCV sweep. Here,
this step is used to estimate the impulse response of the electrochemical
cell prior to each measurement through differentiation of the step
response. The impulse response estimate is then convoluted with the
triangular sweep to generate a prediction of the nonfaradaic charging
current expected for the sweep application. Subtraction of the predicted
charging current allows for removal of this component, diminishing
artifacts that arise from changes in these contributions. This approach
permits removal of some spurious signals, as will be shown for both
in vitro and in vivo FSCV recordings.

Experimental Section
Instrumentation
and Software
T-650 type, cylindrical
carbon-fiber microelectrodes (Thornel, Amoco Corporation, Greenville,
SC; pulled in glass capillaries and cut to 75–125 μm
exposed lengths) were used in experimentation. After pulling, the
seals of electrodes were dipped in epoxy (EPON Resin 828, Miller-Stephenson,
Danbury, Connecticut) mixed with 14% w/w m-phenylenediamine
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 80 °C, briefly washed with
acetone, and heated at 100 °C (5 h) and then 150 °C (at
least 12 h).

Data was acquired with a commercial interface (PCI-6052,
16 bit, National instruments, Austin TX) with a personal home computer
and analyzed using locally constructed hardware and software written
in LabVIEW (TarHeel CV, an earlier version used for simplicity of
programmatic modification, and the more user-friendly HDCV, National
Instruments, Austin, TX).30 Unless otherwise
noted, triangular excursions of the potential were made at a scan
rate of 400 V/s and repeated at a frequency of 10 Hz. Measurements
were conducted inside a grounded Faraday cage to minimize electrical
noise.

Electrochemical Experiments
Flow-injection analysis
experiments were performed using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus,
Holliston, MA) operated at 0.8 mL/min using PEEK tubing (Sigma-Aldrich)
connected to a pneumatically controlled six-port injection valve (Rheodyne,
Rohnert Park, CA). All solutions were prepared in either PBS (137
mM NaCl, 10 mM NaH2PO4, 2.7 mM KCl, and 2 mM
K2H2PO4) or tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane
(TRIS) buffer (2.0 mM Na2SO4, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4·H2O, 140 mM NaCl, 3.25 KCl,
1.2 mM CaCl2·2H2O, 1.2 mM MgCl2·6H2O, and 15 mM Trizma HCl) adjusted to pH 7.4 with
NaOH as necessary. Dopamine solutions were bubbled under nitrogen
to prevent oxidative degradation prior to use. Electrochemical conditioning
of the carbon fiber was achieved through repeated voltammetric sweeps
to +1.3 V vs Ag/AgCl to increase the surface concentration of bound
oxides.13

For convolution-based prediction,
a waveform was created with a small amplitude pulse placed prior (i.e.,
1–3 ms) to the triangular sweep. After measurements were complete,
the data were analyzed in locally written software in LabView. The
discrete derivative of the current response to the potential pulse
was used to generate an estimate of the system impulse response, which
was convoluted with the waveform to yield the background current prediction
that was digitally subtracted from a given recording.31 For color plot generation, digital background subtraction
was performed using these prediction-subtracted backgrounds. To estimate
electrode capacitances at specific potentials, small amplitude triangular
waves were used. The capacitance was determined as 1  where C is the
capacitance, iav is the average current
amplitude at the potential, v is the scan rate, and ip and in are the
current amplitude on the positive
and negative sweeps, respectively.

In Vivo Measurements
Male Sprague–Dawley rats
from Charles River (Wilmington, MA, United States) were pair-housed
on a 12/12 h light/dark cycle. Animal procedures were approved by
the UNC-Chapel Hill Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
For anesthetized experiments, rats (300–550 g) were injected
with urethane (1.5 g/kg, i.p.) and placed in a stereotaxic frame.
Holes were drilled in the skull for the working and reference, with
an additional three holes for the delivery of pinpricks to induce
spreading depression, using coordinates (relative to bregma) from
the brain atlas of Paxinos and Watson.32 The carbon-fiber microelectrode was placed in the nucleus accumbens
at coordinates relative to bregma: anterior/posterior (AP) +2.2 mm,
medial/lateral (ML) +1.7 mm, and dorsal/ventral (DV) −7.0 mm.
The additional holes were located at: −0.8 AP, +0.8 ML; −0.8
AP, +3.2 ML; and −2.8 AP, +1.7 ML. A Ag/AgCl reference electrode
was inserted in the contralateral hemisphere. For the recording presented,
a pinprick was delivered using 27-G hypodermic needles at a depth
of −7.5 DV approximately 2–3 mm from the recording site.

Results and Discussion
1 Background Current and Ionic
Interferences at
Carbon-Fiber Microelectrodes
1.1 Metal Cation Sensitivity
and Voltammetric
Signals in PBS Buffer
As shown in Figure 1A, the background voltammetric signal seen
at carbon fiber microelectrodes in PBS (−0.8–0.8 V vs
Ag/AgCl) deviates from that expected for application of a triangular
voltage ramp to an ideal RC circuit.9 Peaks
are seen around 0.0 and −0.3 V vs Ag/AgCl on the positive and
negative sweeps, respectively, which were attributed to the two-electron,
two-proton reaction of quinone-like moieties on the surface and match
the location of peaks seen during an acidic pH change (Figure 1B).15 Additionally, there is a sharp asymmetry in the impedance properties
of the electrode between more positive (>0.0 V) and negative potentials
(<0.0 V). With electrochemical conditioning, this asymmetry grows,
with relatively large changes seen at only negative potentials.

(D) Adsorption curves (0.025–1.0 mM, top) at each oxidation
time point and representative background-subtracted CV (1.0 mM, bottom)
for magnesium injections.

Of interest, these changes with conditioning correspond with
sensitivity
changes to electrochemically inert ionic species whose signals should
originate solely from background considerations. After each conditioning
interval (0, 3, and 6 min), background-subtracted cyclic voltammograms
for concentration changes of KCl, NaCl, MgCl2, and CaCl2 were obtained (−0.4–1.0 V). In these data,
a noticeable difference is seen between the responses seen with changes
in pH (Figure 1B),
other monovalent cations (Figure 1C and S-1A, bottom), and divalent cations (Figure 1D and S-1B, bottom).
The origins of the peaks seen in the pH voltammogram have been extensively
studied and are hypothesized to be primarily due to the direct participation
of the hydrogen ion in the two-electron redox reaction of a quinone-like
surface-confined moiety.17−19,33 The hydrogen ion’s role in the surface faradaic reaction
makes FSCV at carbon particularly sensitive to changes in its concentration
(e.g., yielding a 4.6 μC cm–2 signal for a
−0.15 pH shift, or Δ[H+] = 16 nM, in Figure 1B). Other monovalent
cations (i.e., K+ and Na+) gave background-subtracted
signals similar to those of classical double-layer charging voltammograms
at considerably higher concentrations (>1 mM). Of note, an overall
slope is seen in the background-subtracted voltammograms, suggesting
a resistance change linked to the large ionic strength changes at
the concentrations studied. Finally, divalent cations give oxidation-responsive
voltammetric signals that are prevalent at negative potentials and
evoked at considerably lower concentrations (μM vs mM). These
signals, which give negative peaks in the background-subtracted voltammograms,
indicate a decrease in capacitance, which has previously been attributed
to displacement of charge in the double layer by the divalent cation.18 Integration of the absolute current values across
the entire voltammograms yield adsorption curves that are linear for
non-hydrogen monovalent cations and curved for the divalent cations.

This behavior corresponds to the well-documented ion exchange capabilities
of these ions. At cation exchange resins, monovalent cations are known
to have interactions weaker than those of divalent cations (with ∼1–2
fold lower selectivity coefficients), leading to the former’s
displacement by the latter.34−36 Here, injections of the divalent
cations likely lead to ion exchange with the ambient monovalent cations
at a surface functionality. Monovalent ion concentration changes,
on the other hand, lead to minimal displacement of the ambient ions
and require much higher concentrations to produce effects. This ion
exchange functionality appears to be redox-active, giving the potential-dependence
in the divalent voltammograms. Given the coincidence of potentials
of the decay in the divalent voltammograms and the quinone-like faradaic
peak, the working hypothesis is that the surface-bound, quinone-like
species (or one with overlapping electrochemical behavior) have considerably
different binding affinities for cations in the oxidized and reduced
state. Indeed, quinone-containing species have been shown to have
such redox-dependent metal cation affinities.37,38

To develop this further, a model was developed to simulate
the
expected current to a voltammetric sweep, given a surface-bound species
that undergoes a reversible redox reaction and holds more charge to
the surface, and thus exhibits a higher capacitance in its reduced
state (Supporting Information). In this
framework, the double layer (in the absence of electroactive compounds
in solution) is treated as a network consisting of a voltage-dependent
impedance element (ZQH, representing the
quinone-like redox reaction and having a Nerstian relation to potential)
and two capacitors (all in series to Rs, the solution resistance). The first capacitor (CQH*) represents the double-layer capacitance at the quinone-like
surface sites. This area-normalized redox-coupled capacitance is assumed
to be a linear function of the concentration of the reduced surface
species (CQH(ΓQH(E))). The second capacitor (CI) is the remaining double-layer capacitance (representing the rest
of the surface), which is treated as voltage-independent. Of note,
such a model can qualitatively account for the shape of the background-subtracted
voltammograms seen with local concentration changes in cations as
well as the background voltammograms seen at carbon fibers (Figure S-8).

1.2 Metal
Cation Sensitivity and Voltammetric
Signals in TRIS Buffer
To explore this further in a medium
more closely resembling the in vivo environment, the responses to
these ionic species were also investigated in TRIS buffer, which contains
ambient levels of all cations studied (145 mM Na+, 3.25
mM K+, 1.2 mM Ca2+, and 1.2 mM Mg2+). Additionally, some of the electrochemically inert TRIS is positively
charged at the pH studied here (7.4) and has previously been shown
to interfere with pH detection, suggesting some interaction with the
quinone-like moiety. There is then expected to be considerable occupation
of the binding sites prior to changes in local concentration of ionic
species. Supporting this hypothesis, injections of TRIS buffer for
an electrode in PBS (both at pH 7.4) show significant changes mainly
in the negative region and give a divalent cation-like background-subtracted
voltammogram (Figure S-2A).

Representative
background-subtracted voltammograms and full voltammogram adsorption
curves are shown in Figure S-2B-E. As compared
to those in PBS, the divalent cation responses are considerably attenuated,
as expected, given the ambient competition for the binding sites.
In comparison, the monovalent cations give intermediate-type signals
with behavior consistent to that seen in PBS but with increased complexity
around the quinone-governed region, which is more pronounced for K+ than for Na+. However, this may be due to ambient
additional species available for ion exchange.

2 Convolution-Based Prediction of Non-Faradaic
Current
As discussed previously, there has been considerable
work done toward the minimization of these background currents and
interferences. Here, we build on these approaches to develop a novel
method for removal of nonfaradaic current from FSCV recordings while
retaining much of the general measurement protocol. Previously, chronoamperometry
was shown to allow separation of the nonfaradaic current due to pH
changes from the faradaic current of dopamine oxidation, and it was
suggested that the alternation between chronoamperometry and FSCV
during recording sessions would prove advantageous.20 We explored the hypothesis that the step response measured
in chronoamperometry, which probes the impedance characteristics of
the electrochemical cell, could be used to predict directly the nonfaradaic
current seen for the triangular sweep application. To do this, the
cell was considered to be a linear system, and we predicted its response
for a given excitation waveform with its impulse response (i.e., the
system response to a unit impulse).29,31,39 The output (y) for an arbitrary
input signal (x) is given through convolution with
the impulse response (h): 2  The current during voltage steps can be used
to arrive at suitable estimates of the impulse response, as the derivative
of the current response to the step provides an estimate of the impulse
function.6,40

This approach requires the use of
a pulse immediately before every FSCV sweep to account for changes
that may occur between sweeps (Figure 2A). The current response (Figure 2B) to the step provides information on the
impedance before each measurement. Due to the small amplitude of the
potential step, the current response should be largely determined
by the nonfaradaic characteristics of the electrochemical cell assuming
appropriate choice of voltage range.9 This
information is then used offline to predict the current response to
the triangular FSCV sweep. Discrete differentiation of each step response
is used to estimate the cell’s impulse response (Figure 2C), and this is convoluted
with the FSCV waveform to generate the prediction of the nonfaradaic
response (Figure 2D).
In practice, even in the absence of electroactive species, residual
current remains (Figure 2E, approximately 20% of the total background current). Evidence of
a faradaic surface species is seen (matching background peaks previously
assigned to the redox reaction of quinone-like moieties) as well as
some unexplained current at positive potentials. However, these prediction-subtracted
total voltammograms can be used with digital background subtraction
to generate background-subtracted voltammograms with attenuated nonfaradaic
interferences.

3 Convolution-Based
Removal
of Ionic Signals
3.1 In Vitro Separation of
Ionic and Dopamine
Voltammetric Signals
The convolution procedure is appropriate
for linear systems and assumes the impedance is independent of potentials.
Thus, this technique should work well for removal of currents where
the main interaction is with the voltage-independent capacitance,
like for those of the monovalent cations described above. To test
this hypothesis, the flow-injection analysis of dopamine, sodium,
and their mixture in TRIS buffer was performed using a waveform with
a voltage step from −0.5 to −0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl (Figures 3A–C). The
method, while not drastically altering the shape of the pure dopamine
voltammogram (Figure 3A), can successfully remove contributions to the current at the dopamine
oxidation potential from an injection of TRIS buffer spiked with 100
mM sodium (Figure 3B). This allows removal of the bulk of the sodium signal in the analysis
of the dopamine–sodium mixture, permitting the use of the dopamine
oxidation potential as a direct marker of dopamine concentration in
a mixture of dopamine and sodium (Figure 3C). Note that, due to their nonlinear responses,
neither the quinone-like peaks nor the divalent cation signals can
be removed in this way. Further, the potentials where the quinone-like
moiety redox reaction occurs should not be used for this method, as
use of this information would lead to inaccurate predictions.

traces at the dopamine oxidation potential (top) with cyclic voltammograms
taken during and after the injection positioned above.

3.2 In Vivo Analysis of Dopamine
during Spreading
Depression
Spreading depression is a neurobiological phenomenon
in which there is a mass depolarization of neurons, leading to a considerable
shift in the ionic balance between the intracellular and extracellular
spaces.41−43 Millimolar changes in the concentrations of common
extracellular ions (e.g., ∼100 mM K+, ∼ 33
mM Na+, and ∼1.5 mM Ca2+), along with
the concomitant release of neurotransmitters (e.g., dopamine), are
expected. However, attempts to track the dopamine release using FSCV
are confounded by the ionic shifts, which produce large capacitive
artifacts in the obtained CVs (Figure 4A, −0.4–1.3 V), which resemble those
seen for changes in the voltage-independent capacitance and local
resistance.

Figure 4 In vivo analysis of supraphysiological release of neurotransmitters
during a spreading depression event using the convolution-based method.
(A) Uncorrected background-subtracted cyclic voltammogram (top) and
color plot (bottom) at 7 s into the recording. (B) Same cyclic voltammogram
(top) and color plot (bottom) after use of the convolution-based method
for removal of capacitive artifacts. Note that the step portion of
the waveform is not shown in the color plots. A single pinprick (−7.5
DV, 2–3 mm away from the recording site) was delivered prior
to this recording.

Using the convolution-based
procedure, the capacitive artifacts
are removed to obtain a cleaner picture of the dopamine changes over
time (Figure 4B). Examination
of the CVs before and after correction (bottom) reveals the method
successfully removes strong artifacts around the switching potential
as well as removes considerable current across the potential window.
Note also that there remains a slight artifact on the negative sweep;
this is attributed to differences in the impedance characteristics
across the potential window. However, the artifact is considerably
smaller than prior to correction. Thus, analysis of the time course
of dopamine release has been considerably simplified with such an
approach.

3.3 In Vitro Flow-Injection
Analysis of Dopamine
As noted earlier, adsorption of organic
species can also lead to
capacitive artifacts. Of interest, these are seen during flow-injection
experiments of dopamine, particularly at high concentration, including
in recordings of dopamine during the earlier oxidation experiment
(Figure S-3). Dopamine adsorption to carbon
surfaces is well-characterized and has been shown to underlie the
sensitivity of FSCV at carbon-fiber microelectrodes toward catecholamines.12,13 Of note, these artifacts are more prevalent in the negative region
of the potential window, suggesting these originate from interactions
similar to the divalent cations shown earlier. Interestingly, it has
been previously reported that the presence of calcium and magnesium
decrease the sensitivity of FSCV toward dopamine.44 Here, in their presence (i.e., in TRIS buffer), the absorption
capacity and the intensity of the artifact are indeed decreased, suggesting
that adsorption competition for the quinone-like moiety may underlie
these effects.

The convolution-based technique was applied to
mitigate the effects of these artifacts for an extended recording
of multiple, closely spaced injections of dopamine boluses at a carbon-fiber
electrode (Figure 5A) in PBS buffer. With a single background subtraction for this time
window, distortions appear over time, both during the dopamine injections
and during later measurement times. However, without correction for
these contributions, the use of the dopamine peak oxidation potential
as an indicator of concentration would suggest that the electrode
sensitivity is decreasing over time (Figure 5C, top), while there is a change in the baseline
dopamine current.

dopamine
in PBS buffer. Dopamine (250 nM) was injected every 30 s (red bars).
(A) Uncorrected and (B) corrected background-subtracted color plots.
(C) Current at the dopamine oxidation potential (top, white dashed
lines in A/B) and capacitive interferent potential (bottom, blue dashed
lines in A/ B).

These capacitive artifacts,
particularly those on the positive
sweep, are removed from the data using the convolution-based procedure
(Figure 5B). In the
corrected data, the peak current during dopamine injections does not
show evidence of baseline drift, and the peak current shows no significant
differences between subsequent injections (Figure 5C, top). This is supported by analysis of
the current at −0.3 V vs Ag/AgCl on the positive sweep (Figure 5C, bottom), where
the current is largely determined by capacitive effects.

Overall,
these results suggest that the increases in dopamine concentration
were leading to capacitive changes at the electrode, which is expected
at the large (by physiological standards) concentrations used in the
experiment (250 nM). Additionally, due to the slow desorption kinetics
of dopamine and the short injection spacing, there was insufficient
time for complete desorption of dopamine between injections.12,45 This would lead to a buildup of surface concentration and a steady
drift in the capacitive characteristics throughout the recording window,
an insight that would be difficult to reveal without the convolution-based
approach.

4 Optimization and Validation
of Convolution-Based
Approach
4.1 Optimization of Measurement Parameters
The idealized response to the application of a voltage step is a
single-order exponential curve.9 At carbon-fiber
microelectrodes, an exponential-like decay is observed. However, it
appears to be multiorder (Figure S-4),
with an extracted single-order time constant about an order of magnitude
larger than that expected for a cylindrical carbon electrode in aqueous
solutions (RC = 39.2 vs 4.5 μs).46,47 While not
characterized further, this may be due to nonideal impedance behavior
(including the effects of the microstructure and internal resistance
of the carbon fiber)48,49 or stray impedance contributions
from the instrumentation. Of note, cyclic voltammetric pseudocapacitance
measurements (Figure S-5) reveal a distribution
of apparent capacitances in the range of 20–40 μF cm–2, close to that reported for edge-plane carbon (although
these measurements have clear Faradaic contributions, likely from
the quinone-like moiety), suggesting that this is not the source of
the nonideality.11 However, despite the
departure from idealized responses, the convolution-based approach
is nevertheless effective.

Of interest here, however, is the
effect of the measurement parameters (i.e., step height and step width).
The convolution theorem states that the time domain convolution is
equivalent to pointwise multiplication in the frequency domain.39 Therefore, insight can be gained through analysis
of the collected data in both the time and frequency domains (Figure S-6).

Concerning step height, smaller
perturbations are preferred, as
they probe the impedance characteristics of the electrochemical cell
with minimal perturbation. However, the effect of noise needs to be
considered, as the discrete derivative is a high-pass filter. This
becomes important when considering that FSCV waveforms are typically
low-pass filtered (most often with a cutoff frequency of 2 kHz). Such
filtering distorts rapid potential changes, and higher cutoff frequencies
are required (increasing noise in the data).50 As such, a trade-off exists: larger pulses improve signal-to-noise
while perturbing the system more and requiring stronger consideration
of the instrumentation used. Here, we consider the practical implications
for the instrumentation (described in ref (47)) common for in vivo FSCV. Figure S-7 shows the current responses in PBS for applications
of voltage steps between 20 and 200 mV as well as the resulting impulse
response estimations in the time and frequency domains. While lower S/N ratios are seen for smaller step sizes,
increasing step height brings a flattening of the current response
and distortion of the impulse response estimates (likely due to the
passive components used for current transduction in the headstage).51 When used for prediction, larger pulses can
result in distortion around the switching potentials of the waveform,
where the high frequency impedance dominates. However, smaller pulses
are inadequate for measuring the low-frequency impedance, resulting
in errors that increase with potential away from the step voltage
region. Analysis of the average predictions and their variance, given
by 20 and 200 mV pulses for 5-second recordings (Figure S-7F), reveal nearly identical average predictions
but considerably higher uncertainty for more removed potentials with
smaller pulses. Use of moderate step sizes (80–120 mV), where
both of these issues are minimized, is thus recommended.

The
pulse width is determined by the frequency range about which
information is needed.40,52 Ideally, a Heaviside step function
would be used to give information on all frequencies; however, the
step must be limited. For application of a step, an ideal RC circuit
would decay to 99.3% over a period equal to 5 times the RC time constant
(for reference, 5RC = 196 and 22.5 μs for the experimental value
from Figure S-4 and the theoretical value,
respectively). Thus, to be conservative, the lower bound was placed
at 25 time constants (here, 1 ms).

4.2 Comparison
with Principal Component Regression
The current standard
for resolving overlapping signals in FSCV
is the use of multivariate analysis, specifically principal component
regression (PCR).26,28,53 Combined with residual analysis, PCR has proven a powerful tool
for dealing with chemical interferents. To compare the results of
the convolution-based method here with the established PCR paradigm,
separate data were recorded for the flow-injection analysis of a mixture
of dopamine (200 nM) and potassium chloride (120 mM) solutions in
phosphate-buffered saline. For this experiment, training sets were
also built from injections of solutions of pure dopamine and pure
potassium chloride at different concentrations. The data were then
analyzed in three different ways. First, PCR models, constructed using
either only dopamine standards (approach 1) or dopamine and potassium
chloride standards (approach 2), were applied to the data. Next, the
convolution-based method was first used to pretreat the data, after
which it was analyzed using a PCR model consisting solely of the dopamine
standards (approach 3).

The current vs time traces for the three
different approaches are shown in Figure 6. As expected, analysis of the untreated
data with a dopamine-only model (approach 1) resulted in a considerable
overestimate (about 4-fold) of the dopamine concentration over time
(dotted line), due to improper assignment of potassium signal to dopamine
(as indicated by the failure of residual analysis, not shown). However,
comparable results are obtained with the PCR-only (approach 2, green)
and convolution/PCR approach (approach 3, orange), with only slight
differences in the peak concentrations predicted and more noise seen
for the latter approach.

Figure 6 Comparison of convolution-based and PCR-only
removal of ionic artifacts.
The PCR predicted concentration traces for flow injection analysis
of a mixture 500 nM dopamine and 120 mM potassium chloride (in PBS
buffer) for the uncorrected data analyzed with a PCR model trained
with only dopamine standards (dashed line) and dopamane/potassium
chloride standards (green line) as well as the corrected data analyzed
using PCR model containing only dopamine (orange line).

While giving similar results, the true advantage
of the convolution-based
approach lies in the experimental simplicity. As noted, to build the
PCR model with both analytes, multiple standards were needed for each,
requiring additional experimental work. The use of the convolution-based
approach required only collection of the dopamine standards and the
use of the pulse during measurements. Further, in vivo PCR model building
is considerably harder, requiring a method for eliciting the interferent
responses. Currently, there are no established protocols for generating
ionic changes for this purpose.

Conclusions
The
data presented here suggest two main types of ionic interactions
with carbon fibers exposed to moderate oxidation, which determine
the shape of the voltammetric responses seen with local ion concentration
changes. Using this framework, we designed a measurement protocol
to remove interference with voltammetric detection of electroactive
species from the voltage-independent capacitance, building on previous
literature approaches. This method uses a small-amplitude pulse coupled
to a voltage sweep for probing and predicting the nonfaradaic behavior
of the electrode. It was successfully able to remove interfering signals
arising from interaction with the voltage-independent capacitance.
Work is currently underway to find ways of minimizing the other types
of ionic interferences.
