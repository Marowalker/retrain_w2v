The
production of high-quality self-assembled monolayers (SAMs)
followed by layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly of macrocycles is essential
for nanotechnology applications based on functional surface films.
To help interpret the large amount of data generated by a standard
ToF-SIMS measurement, principal component analysis (PCA) was used.
For two examples, the advantages of a combination of ToF-SIMS and
PCA for quality control and for the optimization of layer-by-layer
self-assembly are shown. The first example investigates how different
cleaning methods influence the quality of SAM template formation.
The second example focuses on the LbL self-assembly of macrocycles
and the corresponding stepwise surface modification.

==== Body
One objective of modern nanotechnology
is the miniaturization of devices with function in order to increase
performance while improving energy efficiency. In this context, the
top-down approach has been applied extensively by researchers, as
well as by producers. However, the bottom-up approach gained more
attention in the last years, since it is easy to manage on a laboratory
scale.1,2 We have recently demonstrated the deposition
of Hunter/Vögtle-type tetralactam macrocycles, amide rotaxanes,
and gold nanoparticles into ordered and programmable monolayers and
multilayers on gold substrates, using the metal-ion-mediated layer-by-layer
(LbL) approach.1,3,4 These
surface films can be regarded as precursors of nanoscaled devices
that may translate molecular stimuli into macroscopic effects.5

Because of the complexity of these systems,
with regard to elemental
composition, distribution, binding state, order, topology, or layer
sequence, a major task is the choice and execution of suitable analytical
techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV/vis
spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM).
Often, more-sophisticated techniques such as time-of-flight secondary-ion
mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) are required, which provide excellent
surface sensitivity on the molecular level combined with the possibility
of depth-profiling and imaging.6

Recently, this has been demonstrated for self-assembled monolayers
(SAMs) with terminal functional groups, such as pyridine or terpyridine,
that are suitable for complex formation with transition-metal ions
enabling subsequent deposition of monolayers and multilayers composed
of macrocycles and rotaxanes.7,8

To produce high-quality
layer systems, process control of the chemical
surface modification is necessary. This can be achieved via ToF-SIMS
which is a highly sensitive surface characterization technique
that provides elemental and molecular surface chemical information.
It has been shown that, in well-ordered SAMs, the organic molecule
is in an upright conformation, thus having its functional group at
the very surface.9 For the present study,
we anticipate the ToF-SIMS spectra to be very similar, as the tail
is always (ter)-pyridine-terminated. Therefore, a univariate interpretation
of the mass spectra is unreasonable and a multivariate approach has
been chosen using principal component analysis (PCA). PCA is a multivariate
statistical analysis method that can identify the major directions
of variation in a given dataset. A dataset is defined as a matrix
where the rows contain samples and columns contain variables. In the
case of ToF-SIMS data, samples are the mass spectra and the variables
are the individual m/z ratios. The
PCA is calculated from the covariance matrix of this original data
set. PCA is an axis rotation that aligns a new set of axes, called
principal components (PCs) with the maximal directions of variance
within a dataset. PCA creates three new matrices, containing the scores,
the loadings, and the residuals.10 Therefore,
it aids in the interpretation of complex mass spectra (as is the case
for organic ToF-SIMS spectra) by revealing differences between (groups
of) samples (expressed as so-called “scores”)
and relating them back to differences in the variables (called “loadings”) defining a sample.11 The scores plot shows whether samples or a group
of samples are different. The corresponding loadings plot shows the
difference in the mass spectra and fragmentation pattern of the samples
(or the group of samples).10 In principle,
PCA provides the ability to identify key fragment peaks characterizing
a given sample type, a survey of the point-to-point reproducibility
across the sample set, and a summary of the relationship between different
sample sets.12−15

Here, we present the investigation of two examples by applying
PCA-assisted ToF-SIMS. First, the cleaning procedure prior to the
formation of a template SAM with a pyridyl-functional group and an
aliphatic backbone on native silicon oxide is examined in detail.
In order to find a suitable method, three different cleaning procedures
are compared to each other, with respect to PC separation and detected
contaminants. The used template layer is depicted in Figure 1 and is supposed to serve as a model for other functional
template layers. The deposition of palladium(II) ions onto the SAM
is also displayed.

Figure 1 Idealized schematic depiction of the investigated template
layer.

In the second example, a much
more complex system is investigated.
A mixed template layer consisting of decanethiol (DT)
and terpyridine-terminated dodecanethiol (TDT) in a ratio
of 3:1 on gold is used as a preordering template for a further deposition
of macrocycles. In alternating steps, a layer of coordinating Fe(II)
using Fe(BF4)2·6H2O and
a bis-terpyridine functionalized tetralactam macrocycle (MC) is deposited by LbL self-assembly (see scheme in Figure 2).

Figure 2 Idealized
schematic depiction of the iron-mediated LbL self-assembly
of MC. The underlying mixed SAM consists of a 1:3 mixture
of TDT and DT molecules. In steps 1, 3,
and 5, the sample is immersed in Fe(H2O)6(BF4)2 in ethanol (1 mM) for 30 min; in steps 2,
4, and 6, the sample is immersed in a solution of MC in dimethylformamide
(DMF) (1 mM) for 24 h.

Experimental Section
Sample Preparation
Silicon wafers
with thin oxide layers
were activated by immersing them for 30 min in piranha solution (H2O2/H2SO4 = 1/3) and they
were vigorously rinsed afterward with deionized water for 30 s or
2 min, immersed in Millipore water and ethanol, followed
by dichloromethane. [WARNING! Piranha solution must be handled
with the utmost caution because it reacts violently with organic material.] Pyridyldodecane silane (PDS) monolayers were prepared
by immersing the activated substrates into a 5 mM solution of PDS in dichloromethane for 24 h at room temperature (rt).
Palladium deposition on PDS-SAMs was performed by immersing
the surfaces at rt for 10 min in a 1 mM solution of tetrakis(acetonitrile)palladium(II)
tetrafluoroborate in acetonitrile.

Polycrystalline Au substrates
were cleaned in concentrated HCl for 10 min and, afterward, were vigorously
rinsed with deionized (DI) water and immersed in EtOH. Mixed monolayers
were prepared by immersing the substrates into a 1 mM ethanolic solution
of a 1:3 mixture of 12-(-(2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine-4′-yl)dodecane-1-thiol
(TDT) and decane-1-thiol (DT) for 24 h at
rt. Metal deposition was performed within 30 min at rt by immersing
the SAMs into a 1 mM solution of iron(II) tetrafluoroborate hexahydrate
in EtOH. Macrocycle (MC) deposition was carried out by
immersing the surfaces into a 1 mM solution of MC in
DMF. After finishing each deposition step, the samples were thoroughly
washed with ethanol or dimethylformamide for 10 min, dried in a stream
of argon, and stored under argon before characterization.

Time-of-Flight
Secondary-Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS)
All sample measurements
were performed without further pretreatment
on a ToF.SIMS IV instrument (ION-TOF GmbH, Münster, Germany)
of the reflectron-type, equipped with a 25keV bismuth liquid metal
ion gun (LMIG) as the primary ion source mounted at an angle of 45°,
with respect to the sample surface. The LMIG was operated at 0.5 μA
emission current in the so-called “high current bunched”
mode (high mass resolution, low lateral resolution). Bi3+ was selected as primary ion by appropriate mass filter settings.
To improve the focus of the primary ion beam, the pulse width of the
Bi3+ (25 keV) ion pulse was reduced to 11 ns
and the lens target was adjusted to obtain a sharp image on a structured
sample (e.g., silver cross) in the secondary electron mode. The primary
ion current was directly determined using a Faraday cup located on
a grounded sample holder. Operation conditions with these settings
comprised a target current of 0.15–0.17 pA for the selected
primary ion. The total primary ion dose density was set to 5 ×
1011 ions/cm2, ensuring static conditions. Scanning
area for analysis was 200 μm × 200 μm with a pixel
resolution of 256 × 256. The vacuum in the analysis chamber was
in the range of 10–9 mbar during all measurements.

ToF-SIMS spectra were acquired in positive-ion mode with five spots
per sample analyzed. The mass scale was internally calibrated using
several well-defined and easily assignable secondary ions. For the
cleaning study (example 1) including a subsequent coordination of
Pd2+ (see scheme in Figure 1) C4H9+, C5H11+, and C6H13+ were used for
the mass calibration. For the LbL self-assembly experiment (example
2), C3H2+, C4H2+, C5H2+, and Au3+ were taken. The error in calibration (i.e., the
error for those fragments solely used to calibrate the spectra) was
kept below 10 ppm. The individual mass deviation of fragments not
used for calibration might be larger. This level of calibration is
required for a successful PCA and guarantees minimum scattering in
peak positions and minimized errors in setting the integration limits.
The approach outlined here ensures that the variance in the given
dataset is due to real sample differences. Integration limits in m/z regions with overlapping peaks were
placed tightly around each peak, to ensure consistent and accurate
measurements of all peak areas.

Principal Component Analysis
(PCA)
The peak list creation
strategy to perform PCA was carried out by selecting over 400 peaks
in the mass range of m/z 0–350
for both, the survey of the cleaning procedure, including the subsequent
coordination of Pd2+, and the process control of the chemical
surface modification by LbL self-assembly. PCA was performed using
the software R version 2.15.2. [Here, R is an open access program
for statistical computing, downloadable from http://www.r-project.org.] Each peak was normalized to the sum of the selected peak intensities
to correct for variations in the total secondary ion yields between
different spectra. The data were then mean-centered.11

Results and Discussion
Example 1: Assessment of
Cleaning Procedures for SAM Templates
Including a Subsequent Coordination of Pd2+ to an Optimized
SAM
In this study, a pyridyldodecane silane (PDS) SAM on hydroxyl-terminated silicon is generated as a preordering
template for a further coordinative LbL deposition. In the subsequent
step, a layer of coordinating Pd(II), using Pd(CH3CN)4(BF4)2, is deposited.

Figure 3 shows the PDS-SAM and the corresponding
ToF-SIMS mass spectrum obtained in positive-ion mode in the mass range
from m/z 0 to 300. Since this mass
spectrometric method is also very sensitive to contaminants on the
surface, secondary ion signals from inorganic contaminations were
removed from the spectrum in Figure 3 for clarification.
Residues from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) are marked in red to show
the relative intensities, compared to the SAM. [Here, PDMS is a ubiquitous
contamination compound, primarily derived from ground joint grease
used for the sealing and lubrication of ground glass joints during
synthesis and workup.] The low mass range (up to m/z 75) shows hydrocarbon fragments originating from
the dodecane alkyl spacer as well as low intensity mass fragments
containing C, H and N originating from a cleavage of the pyridine
tail group. The high mass range (m/z 75 to 250) shows secondary ion fragments with the typical fragmentation
pattern (successive cleavage of CH2) from the PDS precursor down to the intact pyridine tail group C5H5N+ at m/z = 79.04.
Although the PDS mother ion SiC17H28N+ could be detected, its secondary ion yield is very
low, compared to analogous thiol-based SAMs on Au.16 This is most likely due to a much stronger binding of the
silane headgroup to the silicon surface than thiol to a gold surface.
Therefore, the C17H28N+ secondary
ion at m/z = 246.21 is a characteristic
fragment taken as a proof of the formation of the PDS-SAM. This fragmentation pattern is consistent with that previously
reported for the 12-(pyridine-4-yl)dodecane-1-thiol (PDT) on gold.16

Figure 3 Positive-ion-mode ToF-SIMS spectrum of the PDS SAM.
Peaks in red correspond to PDMS residues from the preparation procedure.

In the initial experiments, a
considerable contamination of sodium
sulfate was observed after SAM formation. To reduce the contamination
and, hence, enhance the quality of the SAM, different cleaning procedures
prior to SAM formation were investigated using PCA. In the standard
cleaning, we carried out a 30-s rinsing with deionized water (procedure
1). After finding the above-mentioned sulfate-impurities, we extended
the rinsing process to 2 min in deionized water (procedure 2). Procedure
3 was composed of rinsing the surface for 2 min in deionized water,
followed by a 10 min immersion in Millipore water after activation
of the surface.

Figure 4 shows the score
plot from a PCA
of the positive secondary ions of the PDS-SAM by three
different cleaning methods, which differ by the amount of time the
surfaces are rinsed with deionized water. It can be seen that procedure
1 is clearly separated on PC1 from the other two procedures. The large
scatter of the data shows a poor point-to-point reproducibility and
the corresponding negative loadings reveal significant contamination
of sodium sulfate by highlighting Na+ and Na3SO4+ secondary ions after PCA originating from
the activation with piranha solution (sulfuric acid), demonstrating
that not all acid was removed prior to SAM formation. This illustrates
a contamination-caused inhomogeneity of the formed SAM. Some other
generic contaminants, PDMS (Si+ and SiC3H9+ fragments) and sodium chloride (characteristic
fragments) also have been observed. However, the positive loadings
highlight secondary fragment ions that are characteristic for the
formed PDS SAM (i.e., C6H7N+ and C7H8N+). It has been
indicated by other authors that, if a SAM is packed more regularly
and well-ordered, more molecular secondary ions characteristic for
the SAM are emitted by the impact of a primary ion.13,17 This holds true also for our SAMs prepared following the cleaning
procedures 2 and 3. This result indicates a major advantage of procedures
2 and 3.

different cleaning procedures (left) and the corresponding loadings
plot showing the variables responsible for the separation on PC1.
The percentage in the brackets denotes how much variance is caught
by the corresponding principal component. [Legend: black squares,
procedure 1; blue triangles, procedure 2; and red circles, procedure
3.] The ellipses show the 95% confidence limit.

To distinguish cleaning procedure 2 from procedure 3, a PCA
was
carried out with only the two corresponding datasets (see Figure 5). The slight separation seen on PC2 in Figure 4 is now on PC1, and the variables responsible for
the difference can be seen on the loadings plot in Figure 5. Note that the secondary fragment ions C2H5O+ (at m/z = 45.03), C6H7N• + (at m/z = 93.05), and C7H8N+ (at m/z = 106.06), characterizing a well-ordered PDS-SAM, are
more pronounced in the loadings plots in Figures 4 and 5 as the cleaning procedure improves,
whereas Na+ and hydrocarbon fragments are the major peaks
in the negative loadings plot for cleaning procedure 1 (see Figure 4) and only the hydrocarbon fragments in cleaning
procedure 3 (see Figure 5). Following the above
conclusion for well-ordered SAMs, a more closely packed SAM is achieved
after applying cleaning procedure 2. In addition, the preferential
orientation of the SAM has been proven by the linear dichroism effect
observed by angle-resolved near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure
(NEXAFS) experiments.1 Note that the additional
rinsing with Millipore water in cleaning procedure 3 did not improve
the quality of the SAM, although the opposite was expected. The overlapping
95% confidence limits in Figure 5 support this
observation.

procedures
2 and 3 (left). The ellipses show the 95% confidence limit. The corresponding
loadings plot of the first principal component shows the variables
(m/z values) responsible for the
separation on PC1. [Legend: blue triangles, procedure 2; red circles,
procedure 3.]

The fragment ions CH3O+ and C2H5O+ are
prominent in the loadings plot of
Figure 4 but are not characteristic for a perfect
SAM. Two possible origins of these ions can be considered: (i) ethanol
is formed as a byproduct during the self-assembly of the triethoxysilyl
precursor and (ii) these fragment ions originate from an uncompleted
reaction of the triethoxysilyl precursor, i.e., not all three ethoxysilyl
groups reacted with the silicon substrate or cross-linked among each
other. Because of the extremely low pressure in the analysis chamber
(10–9 mbar), assumption (i) is not likely, because
all high-vapor pressure residues should be evaporated. Therefore,
assumption (ii) is the more-convincing conclusion.

A PCA was
also carried out for the coordination step of Pd2+ to the
PDS SAM (see scheme in Figure 1). Therefore,
∼400 peaks were selected that could be assigned
to the PDS and PDS + Pd SAM. Peaks unambiguously attributable to inorganic
and PDMS contaminations were not included in this dataset. In principle,
it would be sufficient to just check for the presence of Pd+ secondary ions, which are, of course, detected at m/z = 105.90 with the typical isotope pattern, but
a ToF-SIMS mass spectrum usually contains much more information. PCA,
on one hand, helps to find this information and, on the other hand,
helps to interpret it. Figure 6 shows the scores
and the loadings plot of the surface modification with Pd(CH3CN)4(BF4)2. It can be clearly seen,
in the positive loadings, that not only Pd+ secondary ions
are responsible for the separation of the two groups of samples, but
also CH2N+ (a fragment ion from the neutral
ligand CH3CN) and adduct ions containing the CH3CN ligand (e.g., C4H5·CH3CN,
Pd·CH3CN) from the Pd precursor. The negative loadings
are composed of secondary ions that can definitely be assigned to
the PDS-SAM in Figure 3. Figure 6 not only shows that the coordination step was successful,
but also that the surface composition is, as expected for the used
Pd-precursor, composed of neutral CH3CN ligands coordinated
to Pd2+. Another evidence for the coordination of Pd2+ to the surface ligand could be found due to the significant
presence of F– and BF4– secondary ions in the negative ion mode ToF-SIMS spectra.

modification of the PDS SAM with Pd(CH3CN)4(BF4)2 as depicted in Figure 1. The ellipses show the 95% confidence limit. Corresponding

Example 2: Layer-by-Layer Self-Assembly of Hunter/Vögtle-Type
Tetralactam Macrocycles
To analyze the complex systems described
in this example, each chemical surface modification step is monitored
by ToF-SIMS.

The dataset consisted of spectra of five measurement
spots per individual sample (see Table 1 for
an overview of sample notation) with over 450 variables (i.e., peaks, m/z values). Known inorganic contaminants
were not considered in the dataset.

Figure 7 shows scores
plots of the entire
dataset. Figure 7a shows that the individual
samples are well-separated on PC1, although deviations in the mass
spectra were not easily discernible by a univariate approach. The
clustering of samples 6–10, 16–20, and 26–30
(Fe coordinated to the terpyridine end group) and samples 11–15
and 21–25 (terpyridine end group on the MC) on
the nearly same PC1 score in the scores plot also indicates that these
samples exhibit similar spectra. However, a plot of the PC1 scores
versus the PC2 scores (Figure 7b) shows that
only samples 11–15 and 21–25 and samples 16–20
and 26–30 cluster on similar coordinates. Samples 6–10
(TDT/DT-Fe), in contrast, are well-separated.
Although samples 31–35 exhibit the same surface chemistry,
i.e., the terpyridine end-group points toward the surface, a clustering
similar to the other terpyridine-terminated MCs would
have been expected. However, they are separated from them. The reason
for this is unclear. It could be due to a change to a more-tilted
orientation or due to an accumulation of defects in the course of
stack formation.

Figure 7 PCA scores plot of the entire dataset: (a) PC1 scores
versus the
sample number and (b) PC1 versus PC2 scores. The dashed lines in panel
(a) and the ellipses in panel (b) denote the 95% confidence limit.

To determine which variables (m/z values) are responsible for the separation
in the scores plot for
each chemical modification step, a PCA of the corresponding subsystems
(e.g., TDT/DT and TDT/DT-Fe, TDT/DT-Fe and TDT/DT-FeMC, etc.) was performed using always
the same set of variables (i.e., peak list). Each PCA of the subsystem
catches a huge amount of variance on PC1 (>94%, except for the
last MC deposition step, which catches a variance of
84%), confirming
an excellent separation of the samples. The resulting scores and the
corresponding loadings plots showing the main variables of interest
for each modification step are depicted in Figures 8, 9, and 10.
The peaks with significant loadings are labeled with the measured
mass and are summarized in Table 2. PC1 clearly
discriminates the Fe-coordinated terpyridine group from the
noncoordinated ones and the corresponding variables are highlighted
in the loadings plot. The Fe coordinated end-group is reflected in
the loadings plot where the loadings of the iron-containing secondary
ions correlate with the corresponding Fe coordinated SAM. The PCA
emphasizes not only the presence of Fe (main isotope at m/z = 55.94) as well as typical pyridine and terpyridine
fragments coordinated with Fe (m/z = 133.97, 289.03, 302.04, 314.03), but also accentuates m/z values containing the neutral ligand
H2O to the Fe-coordinated terpyridine fragments (m/z = 309.04, 321.04, 334.05, 348.05).
This clearly shows the presence of chemically bound water on the outermost
surface originating from the used Fe(BF4)2(H2O)6 precursor. A ToF-SIMS spectrum acquired in
negative-ion mode also shows the presence of BF4– secondary ions.

a m/z values shown in boldface
font are key fragments of the MC-terminated SAM highlighted
by PCA.

The TDT/DT-SAM, as well as the corresponding
layers terminated with MC, are characterized by high
loadings peaks containing pyridyl (m/z = 78.04) and terpyridyl (m/z = 247.12, 260.13, 274.14) fragment cations.

A recent MM2 force
field modeling calculation shows that a densely
packed macrocycle layer is tilted at an angle of 38° from the
surface plane,3 thus exposing the terpyridine
end-group on top of the surface. This is also a possible explanation
of the appearance of secondary ions highlighted by the PCA corresponding
to this end group as listed in Table 2 (m/z values shown in boldface font) and
shown in Figure 11, keeping in mind that the
rest of the macrocycle is well-protected from impinging primary ions.
The terpyridine group is cleaved from the macrocycle, as indicated
by the gray wavy line in Figure 11. This fragment
ion is subject to further fragmentation by losing CxHy, breaking the terpyridine, and
finally leaving characteristic pyridine secondary ions. This is then
further cleaved to unspecific hydrocarbons and N-containing hydrocarbons.

Figure 11 Structures
of the main SIMS-fragments of the MC-terminated
SAM highlighted by PCA. The wavy line shows where the main fragmentation
takes place. The fragment ions depicted in the figure are not to be
understood as sequential fragmentation. It is not clear whether this is a consecutive or a parallel fragmentation.

Conclusion
A time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry
(ToF-SIMS) study
supported by PCA was carried out on self-assembled monolayers, and
a thin film system was grown by layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly,
respectively. It was shown in example 1 how high-end surface analysis
can help improve the quality of SAM formation. Different preparation
procedures could be evaluated to select the best one for subsequent
deposition steps. Example 2 showed how stepwise surface self-assembly
can be monitored. Starting from a preordered SAM template, each step
of the surface self-assembly was monitored by ToF-SIMS. With the use
of PCA in this monitoring process, the quality of the layer stack
could be controlled precisely. This is important for the bottom-up
development of nanoscaled devices that may translate molecular stimuli
into macroscopic effects.

The combination of both high-end surface
analysis complemented
and multivariate data analysis is a powerful tool for the development
of high-quality layer stacks. PCA carves out differences between samples,
i.e., even slight residues like sodium sulfate in example 1, a nonperfect
self-assembly or marginal differences in signal intensity can be accentuated.
Therefore, it is very important for the analyst to assess the trends
seen in principal component analysis (PCA) and determine whether these
trends are due to a mere artifact or due to real sample differences.
