Metabolism is essential to understand
human health. To characterize
human metabolism, a high-resolution read-out of the metabolic status
under various physiological conditions, either in health or disease,
is needed. Metabolomics offers an unprecedented approach for generating
system-specific biochemical definitions of a human phenotype through
the capture of a variety of metabolites in a single measurement. The
emergence of large cohorts in clinical studies increases the demand
of technologies able to analyze a large number of measurements, in
an automated fashion, in the most robust way. NMR is an established
metabolomics tool for obtaining metabolic phenotypes. Here, we describe
the analysis of NMR-based urinary profiles for metabolic studies,
challenged to a large human study (3007 samples). This method includes
the acquisition of nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy one-dimensional
and J-resolved two-dimensional (J-Res-2D) 1H NMR spectra obtained on a 600 MHz spectrometer,
equipped with a 120 μL flow probe, coupled to a flow-injection
analysis system, in full automation under the control of a sampler
manager. Samples were acquired at a throughput of ∼20 (or 40
when J-Res-2D is included) min/sample. The associated
technical analysis error over the full series of analysis is 12%,
which demonstrates the robustness of the method. With the aim to describe
an overall metabolomics workflow, the quantification of 36 metabolites,
mainly related to central carbon metabolism and gut microbial host
cometabolism, was obtained, as well as multivariate data analysis
of the full spectral profiles. The metabolic read-outs generated using
our analytical workflow can therefore be considered for further pathway
modeling and/or biological interpretation.

==== Body
The oldest
known form of diagnostics
in humans using body fluid analysis was done on urine. As early as
400 BC, urine was poured on the ground, and in the event of attracting
insects, patients were diagnosed with boils.1 Nowadays, urine analysis is conventionally employed in standard
clinical research to identify, among others, kidney and urogenital
disorders. Products of cellular metabolism as metabolites, proteins,
and salts are excreted in urine. Urine contains many low molecular
weight compounds, in particular nitrogen-rich molecules, such as urea,
creatinine, and amino acids but also various organic acids and sugars,
as well as xenobiotics, and detoxified and nonmetabolized compounds.
Probably the most comprehensive list of metabolites identified in
urine so far is presented in the Human Metabolome Database, containing
over 3000 chemical species obtained by a variety of analytical techniques.2 Urine analysis provides novel insights into the
metabolism taking place, in which certain metabolites may associate
with the subject’s physiological condition, under the influence
of genotypic and environmental settings. According to the type of
sample collection (spot or 24 h urine), urinary metabolic profiles
give an approximate time-averaged representation of the recent homeostatic
metabolic changes of the individual, in addition to carry indirect
information on dietary exposure, as well as certain gut microbial
metabolic activities. The latter has been recently associated with
various conditions, such as cardiovascular disease,3 type 2 diabetes,4 obesity,5 nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,5 central nervous system diseases,6 and cancer.7 The application of metabolomics
to urine samples has been largely promoted due to the noninvasiveness
of the sample collection, well suited in epidemiological or clinical
studies, and yet providing the required proficiency in detecting metabolic
changes.

To capture the multitude of metabolites present in
urine, analytical
methods such as mass spectrometry (MS) and NMR spectroscopy are often
used in metabolomics analyses. Particularly when dealing with large
population studies, rigorous analytical set-ups and data processing
pipelines are required to provide and ensure the following: (1) unequivocal
labeling of samples, (2) metabolite-rich information, (3) metabolite
identification, (4) metabolite quantitation, (5) selectivity to detect
biological differences, (6) high-throughput, (7) robustness, (8) reproducibility,
(9) stability over time, and (10) minimal technical errors, so that
relevant metabolic changes can be investigated through various data
mining strategies. NMR gathers most of these properties and is an
expert tool to generate metabolic profiles from biofluids such as
urine.

The opportunity to perform “tubeless” NMR,
without
compromising data quality, seems both attractive (e.g., suppression
of tubes altogether) and practical in the analysis of large-scale
studies, in particular for high-throughput applications. In the early
1980s, the development of dedicated flow NMR probes has opened the
field to on-flow NMR applications, such as liquid chromatography (LC)-
and flow injection analysis (FIA)-NMR.8 While LC-NMR methodologies9 were extensively
developed with the purpose of compound identification strategies,8,10 FIA-NMR was applied for screening and high-throughput applications.11,12 FIA-NMR was first introduced in 1997, before being extended to a
few other metabolomics studies.13,14

NMR is a quantitative
technique that therefore offers the opportunity
of quantifying metabolites directly from 1H NMR metabolite
profiles, avoiding additional sample preparation or analyses, with
the possibility of quantifying unexpected metabolites (unlike MS-based
quantitative methods). A 1H NMR spectrum of a biofluid,
such as urine, can be viewed as the sum of its individual metabolites
and if acquired under quantitative conditions can be used for both
metabolite identification and quantitation. The NMR signal intensity
is essentially related to the concentration (actually, to the number
of nuclei responsible for the signal), although influenced by many
experimental and sample dependent parameters.15−17 Many quantitation
methods have been developed for NMR measurements, leading to both
relative and absolute quantitation,15 such
as internal or external quantitation references, electronic reference
signals,18 and library-based quantitation
tools (e.g., the software provided by Chenomx, ACD/Laboratories, Mestrelab,
and Bruker AMIX).

Here, we describe an automated high-throughput
NMR-based metabolomics
method for urine analysis. All analyses are controlled by a sample
manager that tracks samples along the full metabolomics pipeline (labeling,
FIA-NMR analysis, spectra preprocessing, and data storage). The samples
are barcode-identified, prepared for analysis by a robot handling
96-well plates, and submitted to the FIA-NMR setup. High-resolution 1H NMR spectra are obtained, preprocessed, and transferred
in an automated way for further data handling. The identification
and quantitation of metabolites directly from urine profiles is achieved
by using a standard compounds knowledge-base approach. We believe
this method will be of relevance for undergoing large-scale urine
metabolomics analyses in population studies.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
Heavy water (99.8 atom % D) used for NMR
analysis was obtained from Cortecnet (Paris, France). Sucrose (BioXtra,
purity ≥99.5%), d-(+)-glucose (purity 99.5%), hippuric
acid (purity 98%), succinic acid (purity ≥99%), d-alanine
(purity ≥99%), sodium azide (BioXtra), sodium phosphate dibasic
(purity ≥99.0%), and nitric acid (purity ≥65%) were
obtained from Sigma–Aldrich (Buchs, Switzerland). Sodium dihydrogen
phosphate monohydrate, (purity ≥99.0%) and methanol-d4 (≥99.8% for NMR spectroscopy MagniSolv)
were purchased from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany), and 3-(trimethylsilyl)-2,2′,3,3′-tetradeuteropropionic
acid sodium salt (TSP) was obtained from Dr. Glaser AG (Basel, Switzerland).
The standard line shape test solution (chloroform in acetone-d6) used for NMR flow injection was provided
by Bruker (Rheinstetten, Germany). Ultrapure water was obtained from
a Direct-Q 5 ultrapure water system, Millipore (Zug, Switzerland).

Biological Samples
In this multicenter study, 3007
urine samples of healthy men and women (ages 35–74, mean average
58 years old) were collected as morning-spots. All urine samples were
obtained within the Mark-Age project (www.mark-age.eu).
Appropriate ethical approval from the research ethics committee was
acquired to allow the collection of human urine samples for metabolomics
purposes. The collection, storage, and associated sample logistics
were coordinated to ensure sample integrity: samples were kept cold
until being sent in cryogenic containers filled with dry ice. After
arrival to the laboratory, the frozen samples were stored at −80
°C before analysis.

Solutions and Eluents
Sample Extraction Buffer
A 0.6 M phosphate-buffered
saline pH 7.40 with 0.2 g/L TSP and 0.5 g/L NaN3 was used
as sample extraction buffer.

Quality Control (QC) Sample
A 20 mM sucrose solution,
0.5 mM TSP, 2 mM NaN3 in 90% H2O/10% D2O (v/v) was used for line-shape assessment, system equilibration,
and quality control.

FIA Push-Eluent and Sample Train Eluent
A 90% H2O/10% D2O solution (v/v) was prepared
in a hermetic
bottle to be used as eluent in the FIA system.

FIA Cleaning
Solution
For each cleaning event, 1 mL
of 25% (v/v) 65% HNO3 in 90% H2O/10% D2O solution (v/v) was freshly prepared.

Sample Preparation
Urine samples were randomized before
proceeding with sample preparation. All samples (urine and QC) were
prepared using the MICROLAB STAR liquid handling workstation (Hamilton)
in a 1:2 proportion (buffer/sample). Samples were taken from −80
°C freezers, thawed in batches of 96 (85 urine samples and 11
QC samples), and a sample table was elaborated (as the samples were
not provided with barcodes from the collection centers) for each plate.
The samples were then prepared plate by plate, progressively, just
before NMR acquisition. By using the implemented sample preparation
routine, each plate was prepared in less than 15 min. This procedure
was done using tailor-made routines under the control of Hamilton
method manager software, version 5 (Hamilton) (see the Supporting Information).

FIA
As a FIA device,
a Bruker efficient sample transfer
(BEST) system was used. A Peltier cooling controller was employed
to cool a sample rack able to hold simultaneously two barcode-labeled
sample plates. The infusion method was optimized for aqueous solutions
(D2O and H2O), and the transfer volumes and
transfer speeds parameters were set using the BEST-NMR administration
toolbox within TopSpin (Bruker BioSpin) (see the Supporting Information).

NMR
NMR spectral
acquisition was performed using a
Bruker Avance III NMR spectrometer equipped with 600 MHz magnet Ultrashield
Plus (spectrometer frequency: 600.0299446 MHz), a BCU-05 cooling unit,
and a 4 mm flow probe FISEI 1H-13C/D Z-GRD NMR with 120 μL active
volume. The temperature was fixed to 300 K for all NMR measurements,
and temperature calibration was checked every week, after nitrogen
fill. The line-shape sensitivity and water suppression were tested
to assess probe performance (see the Supporting
Information).

All samples were submitted to the following
sequential NMR measurements: flow cell profile, 1H one-dimensional
version of nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY-1D, noesygppr1d)
and for a subset of spectra, homonuclear 1H J-Resolved two-dimensional correlation (J-Res-2D,
jresgpprqf) (see the Supporting Information). All NMR spectral acquisition and preprocessing were done under
the control of TopSpin 2.1, patch level 6 (Bruker BioSpin), and the
automated submission of a sequence of samples was performed using
ICON-NMR, 4.2.6 build 9 for TopSpin 2.1 (Bruker BioSpin).

Automation
Samples were managed by the sample manager
software SampleTrack 2.60.01 (Bruker BioSpin) that allows the printing
of unique linear barcodes, necessary for identifying samples, according
to their container type. It allows importing sample tables (XLS file);
it deals with complex sample orders, involving the synchronization
of various instruments (FIA and NMR); it submits sequential analytical
methods and steps; it coordinates data acquisition and storage, and
it detains a universal sample database. In terms of configuration,
SampleTrack takes control via a peer-to-peer network the NMR acquisition.

Metabolite Identification
Metabolite identification
was achieved by comparing the obtained urine spectra with spectral
databases containing spectra of standard compounds, including the
database B-BIOREFCODE (Bruker BioSpin) and additional in-house reference
compounds. Further information relevant for identification was complemented
by consulting HMDB,2 Madison Metabolomics
Consortium Database (MMCD),19 Biological
Magnetic Resonance Bank (BioMagResBank),20 Birmingham Metabolite Library (BML-NMR),21 NMRShiftDB,22 Platform for RIKEN Metabolomics
(PRIMe),23 and literature.2,24−28 The identification of metabolites was further verified with homonuclear
and heteronuclear 2D NMR experiments, such as 1H–1H COSY, 1H–1H TOCSY, 1H–13C HMBC, and 1H–13C HSQC.

Metabolite Quantitation
Standard solutions were added
to urine in 1:3 dilutions (n = 8): hippuric acid
(δH = 7.750 ± 0.050 ppm), succinic acid (δH = 2.335 ± 0.035 ppm), alanine (δH =
1.400 ± 0.050 ppm), and (±)-glucose (alpha-, δH = 5.150 ± 0.050 ppm; beta-, δH = 4.563
± 0.037 ppm). Spectra were acquired by FIA-NMR, and quantitation
of these four compounds was obtained by addition of the standard compounds.
In parallel, metabolite quantitation was achieved using a library-based
method, by building a knowledge-base using our internal reference
database within AMIX (Bruker), taking 1H NMR NOESY and 1H J-Res spectra of reference compounds acquired
at pH 7.0. For each metabolite chemical shift intervals, stoichiometry
and multiplicity of resonances were described. Creatinine was used
as an internal reference, and the obtained quantitative values were
expressed as millimoles of metabolite per mole of creatinine.

Data
Analysis
Profiling data were examined using TopSpin
and AMIX-Viewer, version 3.9.9 (Bruker BioSpin) by overlaying spectra
to detect inconsistencies. Flow cell profiles were inspected as a
quality gate; thus, samples that failed to have a correct positioning
inside the flow cell were discarded. As a second step, all nonconforming 1H NMR NOESY-1D spectra due to poor water suppression, poor
shimming, or intractable baseline correction were also discarded.
Extraction of a data matrix from 1H NMR NOESY-1D spectra
was done using the Statistics toolbox within AMIX: bin size was selected
according to data analysis purpose, ranging from 0.04 to 0.0005 (larger
bin sizes depreciate chemical shift variation, at the expense of lower
spectral resolution); the water signal was excluded (4.95–4.70
ppm); a spectral width of 12–0.05 ppm was chosen; TSP signal
intensity was used for technical normalization (0.05 to −0.05
ppm interval); and baseline correction was performed by noise estimation
using the signal-free interval 11–9.5 ppm. A Pareto-scaled
principal component analysis was used to model the urine spectra.

Results and Discussion
Being able to analyze samples at
a high throughput opens the application
of metabolomics to a systems level, where metabolomics technologies
are comparable to genomics or proteomics in providing large-scale
metabolic information about various processes in living organisms.
The primary aim of this study was to establish a robust high-throughput
metabolomics method, providing an untargeted and quantitative overview
of endogenous urinary metabolites, which would be implementable in
future epidemiological studies. Given the large number of samples
dealt in this study, particular emphasis was given on automating the
whole metabolomics pipeline (sample preparation, sample management,
sample injection, NMR acquisition, and data extraction and analysis,
Figure 1A). The methodology aims for a minimum
of manual intervention while ensuring data quality, reproducibility,
quantifiability, and traceability.

by FIA-NMR, including an approximate timing for each step (method
implementation time is not included). (B) Step-by-step description
of the automated FIA-NMR setup.

Planning and timing
Large human
population studies
require years to plan, approve, and implement; therefore, special
attention was given to sample storage and integrity. According to
Lauridsen et al.,29 urine samples are stable
below −25 °C. We have stored our samples at −80
°C prior to sample preparation, and to ensure sample integrity,
an antimicrobial agent was added. Sample preparation required manual
intervention in the preparation of sample lists (as urine samples
were provided with hand-written labels), after which the transfer
and buffer dilution were performed automatically using a sample preparation
robot (Figure 1A). Samples were kept at 10
°C in a cooled tray prior to FIA-NMR analysis.

The FIA-NMR
method was fully automated in terms of NMR data acquisition (Figure 1B). The sample manager attributed a unique sample
identifier to each sample and tracked the samples by submitting analytical
orders and controlling all analysis steps. Samples were transferred
into the NMR probe using an implemented transfer method by FIA. Once
inside the magnet, automatic programs were set so that all required
parameter adjustments for NMR analysis were automated, followed by
data acquisition and preprocessing. After NMR acquisition, samples
were discarded, the probe was rinsed, and the following sample was
transferred. Sample orders could be submitted, plate by plate, while
acquired data was archived and stored in a server, without having
to halt the acquisition. The total FIA-NMR analysis time per sample
was 20 min (and 40 min when J-Res-2D was included).
Because J-Res-2D was recorded for the first 15 plates
only, the total analysis time was reduced by roughly half. This study
required 4 months of FIA-NMR analysis, including weekly breaks for
nitrogen fill, reconditioning, preventive cleaning, and troubleshooting.

Sample Traceability
To make sure all sample information
is recorded and traced, a sample manager associated to a database
was used to deal with sample identification and labeling (associated
barcode, sample name, and sample history), FIA-NMR method used (date
of analysis, transfer method, NMR measurements, and error occurrence),
and data management (folder organization, archiving, storage, and
access) (Figure 1).

FIA-NMR Method Performance
A prerequisite to implement
a FIA-NMR methodology is the quality of acquired spectra that should
be comparable to conventional “tube”. In flow-NMR, the
correct placing of the sample in the active detection cell is a prerequisite
for spectra acquisition and should be optimized beforehand for proper
alignment. Once the optimization is done for a specific solvent, these
parameters (transfer volumes and speeds) are constant if no modification
is applied. A simple and fast test to confirm the fullness of the
active detection cell is done by acquiring a flow cell profile (Figure 2A) that is routinely implemented for every injected
sample by FIA-NMR.

as a
routine analysis by FIA-NMR: (A) flow cell profile; (B) 1H NMR NOESY-1D; (C) 1H J-Res-2D; citric
acid signal in 1H NMR NOESY-1D and 1H J-Res-2D (E) spectra of (gray) urine and (black) standard
compound.

To assess the NMR performance
of the flow probe (in comparison
to “tube NMR” probes), the suite of standard NMR tests
(line shape, sensitivity, and water suppression) was performed. Standard
performance tests use nonaqueous solvents (1% chloroform in acetone-d6 for line shape; 0.1% ethylbenzene in cloroform-d1 for sensitivity) that are impractical when
used in FI systems: the solutions would have to be freshly prepared
before each analysis, making it difficult to standardize the concentration
over time, and it would have to be injected directly into the probe,
given the incompatibility of the solvents with the FI system. Therefore,
we attempted to assess performance using a QC sample. The line-shape
test using the conventional standard sample (1% chloroform in acetone-d6) gave the following results: hump 6.9/11.9
Hz with a 0.45 Hz resolution; thereafter, it was assessed by calculating
the resolution of the anomeric proton of sucrose in the QC sample
(Figure 3A) that was optimized to as low as
25%. The sensitivity was tested using the QC sample, in which the
signal-to-noise was calculated for the anomeric proton of sucrose,
yielding the ratio 1186.26:1. In terms of water suppression, the ratio
8.8/23.4 Hz was obtained for the water signal of the QC sample. Thus,
all these tests indicate that the flow probe performs well using defined
solutions, as QCs. When analyzing biological samples, such as urine,
the probe is also performing well, as seen by the obtained resolution
and water suppression (Figure 2B,C).

Chemical shift stability of anomeric proton of sucrose, expressed

In terms of FIA-NMR performance, the sample carry-over was
estimated
by comparing the signal-to-noise of the anomeric proton of a QC sample
after a blank sample (9:1, H2O/D2O) injection,
in automated mode. A ratio of 3.3% was obtained with the implemented
in-between analysis cleaning procedures, which was considered acceptable,
and it is lower than reported elsewhere.13

In sum, FIA-NMR allows the acquisition of NMR spectra in a
proficient
manner, suppressing the usage of NMR tubes altogether, by using cheaper
and easier to trace plates, avoiding the tedious and rigorous manipulation
of filling and handling glass tubes.

FIA-NMR Method Stability
The technical robustness of
a method is a required parameter to consistently provide high quality
data usable for biological insight. Because the total analysis time
took place over months, we implemented the analysis of QC samples
not only for system equilibration and optimization but also as a stability
check: for every 10 biological samples, a QC sample was injected,
along the full duration of the analyses. Biological QC samples are
often used, in particular in LC/MS analysis, but given the large volume
that would be needed for this study, a sucrose standard solution was
used instead. The advantages are the large volume of QC sample that
can be prepared prior to this study, so that the same solution (at
exactly the same concentration) could be used for comparison. Thus,
the stability of QC samples over time (and plate) was assessed (Figure 3); in particular, the following parameters were
closely monitored: stability of the signal intensity, spectral resolution,
and chemical shift variation.

The NMR signal is influenced by
many experimental and sample dependent parameters, including analytical
variants as sample preparation, FIA parameters, and NMR experimental
parameters. To check the stability of the signal intensity, the total 1H NMR NOESY-1D spectral intensities of 377 QC samples acquired
along the full length of the study were compared, yielding an associated
error of 12% (with a spread of ±30%), Figure 3B.

The spectral resolution is assessed by the shimming
quality; therefore,
this parameter was inspected by comparing the valley-to-peak ratio
(%v/p, Figure 3A) of the anomeric proton of sucrose present in the QC sample, Figure 3C. The shimming parameters were optimized at least
every week using a QC sample to a starting value of at least 25%.
Throughout the study, the average obtained resolution was 29%. After
the analysis of the 15th plate, the shimming quality improved to an
average %v/p of 27%, with an associated
error of 2%, Figure 3C.

The third parameter
analyzed for robustness was the stability of
the proton chemical shift, δH. It is known that the
δH values of a particular molecule depend primarily
on the molecule itself but also on the solvent used, concentration,
temperature, pH, metal ion concentrations, protein–metabolite
and metabolite–metabolite interactions, or other chemical interactions.
In aqueous solutions, such as H2O/D2O, the δH highly depends on pH; therefore, the samples are buffered
before analysis. In addition, all spectra were calibrated to the TSP
signal (δH = 0) in a preprocessing step, undergoing
a one-point δH axis calibration. The variation of
the anomeric proton δH of sucrose in QC samples was
calculated for this study, and the variation obtained was 2 ×
10–3%, Figure 3D. Obviously,
this effect is likely to be more predominant in matrices such as urine,
in which the presence of salt influences the ionic strength, and resonances
corresponding to certain molecules can experience larger deviations.

Metabolite Coverage in Urine Profiles by 1H NMR
More than 3000 samples, including biological and QC samples, were
analyzed by FIA-NMR analysis (Figure 1A–C).
The identification of compounds from complex mixtures, as in metabolomics,
is an intricate endeavor, as metabolite signals overlap and can lead
to small chemical shift variations that hinder assignments. In this
study, spectral databases containing spectra of standard compounds
were used to proceed with the identification of urine metabolites
using NOESY-1D profiles and J-Res-2D (Figure 2D,E). J-Res-2D adds increased resolution
for 1D-NMR assignments, as multiplicities are put in evidence, facilitating
identification. A list of 85 known urine metabolites was compiled
from literature and HMDB. Except for glycerophosphocholine, found
by Wishart,25 all metabolites have been
found in urine according to HMDB. Of these, 81 were present in our
internal spectral database. For 45 metabolites, their detection was
not feasible either due to low signal-to-noise or overlap. Thus, 36
endogenous metabolites were found in urine, belonging to central metabolism,
as glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and Krebs cycle, pyrimidine metabolism,
amino acid metabolism, creatinine-related metabolites, and gut microbial–host
cometabolites (Table 1). In the identification
of metabolites from NMR spectra of mixtures, spectral-driven approaches
were the most reliable. The spectra of standard compounds acquired
in the same conditions as the mixture spectra (solvent, temperature,
and pH) can be overlaid with mixture spectra, for better assessment
of chemical shift, resonance shape, and stoichiometry. From all the
databases consulted, urine-specific literature and urine-specific
databases, such as HMDB, were the most helpful in providing additional
confirmation for the resonances observed (biological occurrence and
complementary evidence, such as MS or 2D-NMR information).

Metabolite Quantitation from 1H NMR Urine Profiles
NMR offers the opportunity of quantifying
metabolites directly
from 1H NMR metabolite profiles. Metabolite quantifiability
was tested for the established FIA-NMR method using a standard addition
and a calibration curve method for four chemically different compounds:
a sugar ((±)-glucose), an aromatic carboxylic acid (hippuric
acid), an organic acid (succinic acid), and an amino acid (alanine).
For all compounds, a regression r > 0.99 was obtained
using urine as a background, suggesting the adequacy of the FIA-NMR
method for quantitation (see Figure 1, Supporting
Information). These results are in accordance with previous
findings where, in optimum conditions, the linearity response of a
regression r > 0.999 was reported for NMR measurements.30 Nevertheless, this quantitation approach has
the disadvantage of being labor-intensive, as requiring the preparation
and analysis of additional samples proportional to the number of analytes
to quantify. Due to the large number of metabolites coexisting in
a 1H NMR spectrum profile, the usage of library-based integration
tools allows not only the identification but also the quantitation
of a series of metabolites directly from spectra. There are different
tools that offer this type of approach; however, we have chosen AMIX,
as our internal reference database is integrated in this tool. Our
quantitation strategy (example of one metabolite, citric acid, in
Figure 2D,E) was implemented for 85 previously
identified metabolites in urine (Table 1).
As an example, this procedure was applied to one spectrum (Figure 2) where metabolite quantitative values were obtained
for 36 detected metabolites, Table 1 (taking
about half an hour of analysis time, Figure 1A). In the event of obtaining the absolute molarity of creatinine
by other means, these relative quantitative values can become absolute.
Surely, this strategy evolves initial effort in establishing the knowledge-base,
but once implemented, it can be readily applied to specific or a batch
of spectra within this study. Extrapolation of this knowledge-base
to other urine studies is still to be assessed. Higher metabolite
quantitation coverage and enhanced data analysis performance (advanced
peak-picking, faster analyses) can be further achieved by including
advanced 2D NMR spectra (e.g., 1H–13C
at the expense of acquisition time) and computational strategies31−33 or a combination of the two34,35 to face the signal
overlap in 1D NMR spectra.

Urine Metabolomics Data Extraction and Analysis
Urine
metabolite profiles (1H NOESY-1D spectra) were inspected
by spectral overlay for data quality. Spectra with poor water suppression
or baseline or failure of acquisition or sample transfer (probe not
correctly filled or communication issue) were discarded. Ninety-five
percent of the analyzed biological samples were successfully acquired
(2879 spectra) and can be used for data modeling and subsequent biological
interpretation. In terms of data transformation, normalization to
the TSP signal was necessary to correct for slight variations in the
sample volume, inherent to FIA-NMR. Multivariate statistics was used
for a preliminary inspection of the technical quality of the data,
as a whole (taking about 1 h of analysis, Figure 1A). By applying principal component analysis, urine spectra
were modeled (Figure 4), and no plate-specific
tendencies were identified, putting in evidence the robustness of
the method. Some biological outliers can be detected due to the presence
of glucose in urine. According to specific hypotheses that might be
pertinent to test, dedicated data analysis routines could be implemented
using more advanced statistical strategies.

Figure 4 Pareto-scaled scores
plot (principal component 1 vs principal component
2) derived from a principal component analysis of 2879 urine spectra
(number of rectangular bins used: 287, taken from 12–0.05 ppm),
scaled to intensity of the TSP signal, with a confidence level of
99.00%. The five seemingly outliers correspond to samples with a high
concentration of glucose, as confirmed by spectral inspection.

Concluding Remarks
The presented FIA-NMR method is well suited for acquiring high-quality 1H NMR metabolomics data, from a large number of subjects,
as proven by its performance, stability, and robustness. This method
offers the following advantages: suppression of tubes that not only
decreases analysis price but also reduces the sample preparation time;
increased throughput, as more samples can be continually analyzed,
in comparison to regular tube holders; decreased human intervention,
given the integration of a sample manager that coordinated all analytical
steps and provided data storage in an orderly manner. We therefore
recommend this method in laboratories where there is a high demand
in standard urine metabolomics analysis. The implementation might
not be trivial for FIA beginners, but once the method is implemented,
thousands of samples can be robustly analyzed. Concerning the applicability
of this method to other biological matrices, aqueous-based samples
of comparable viscosity to urine should provide analogous results;
in terms of robustness, however, high viscous matrices as plasma or
serum might require stricter cleaning routines and should be carefully
tested.

Concerning the direct quantitation of metabolites from 1H NMR spectra using a standard compound knowledge-base, even
though
more sophisticated methods are available, this remains a simple strategy.
It does not require additional NMR acquisition time or elaborate computational
algorithms, providing quantitative values for a fair amount of metabolites,
with minimum effort.
