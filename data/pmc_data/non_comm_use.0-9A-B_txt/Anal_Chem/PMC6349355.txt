We demonstrate a
high-throughput chemoprinting platform that confirms
the consistency in the higher-order structure of protein biologics
and is sensitive enough to detect single-point mutations. This method
addresses the quality and consistency of the tertiary and quaternary
structure of biologic drug products, which is arguably the most important,
yet rarely examined, parameter. The method described uses specific
small-molecule ligands as molecular probes to assess protein structure.
Each library of probe molecules provides a “fingerprint”
when taken holistically. After proof-of-concept experiments involving
enzymes and antibodies, we were able to detect minor conformational
perturbations between four 48 kDa protein mutants that only differ
by one amino acid residue.

==== Body
The recognized
significance
of pharmaceutical biologics lies in their ability to provide effective
therapies for previously incurable conditions. This modality has developed
as a major therapeutic option, and there is an ever-increasing need
for constant improvement to the development paradigm, especially during
manufacturing, where it is critical to assess drug quality accurately.1 This is especially important when changes are
implemented to a manufacturing process, where ultrasensitive analytical
methods are required to quickly assess the product and ensure the
industry’s high safety and efficacy standards are met.2

Due to the structural complexity of a biologic,
extensive physicochemical
characterization is required involving multiple complementary and
orthogonal analytical methods.3 Mass spectrometry
(MS) is easily automated and has advantages of speed, specificity,
and sensitivity in detecting primary amino acid sequence changes (e.g.,
truncation, deamination, oxidation)4 and
post-translational modifications (e.g., glycosylation, phosphorylation).5 Structure preservation,6 in particular, is of paramount importance when establishing a biologic’s
efficacy and safety of use.7 Due to its
association to function, higher-order structural changes can result
in severely diminished activity and immunogenicity.8 It is therefore not surprising that regulatory agencies
have increased scrutiny around drug manufacturers’ ability
to confirm structural continuity between bulk samples of temporal
lots.9 Unfortunately, no method currently
assesses these changes in a reliable and high-throughput fashion.
To address this, we have developed a high-throughput chemoprinting
platform based on affinity selection mass spectrometry (ASMS) that
confirms the higher-order structure of biologics (down to single-point
mutations) using specific small-molecule ligands as molecular probes.

Our overall workflow (depicted in Scheme 1) relies upon ASMS, which is a high-throughput
technology that directly assesses ligand/target interactions.10 The ligand is ultimately identified by its unique
mass signature, and because of this, hundreds of compounds can be
screened simultaneously if each ligand has a unique mass. In this
process, the biologic is first incubated with a small molecule or
mixture of molecules (mass-encoded mixture), allowing specific protein–ligand
complexes to form. The molecules with weak or no affinity are removed
from solution using size exclusion chromatography. This results in
an eluate-containing protein and an enrichment of ligand(s) that have
affinity for the biologic. Reversed-phase accurate-mass liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS) analysis follows, to detect the mass of
the ligand(s). The amount of ligand bound (selection), normalized
to the signal detected from the small molecule in the absence of the
protein target (control), generates a relative binding affinity percentage
(%RBA). A higher %RBA is, in most cases, indicative of a stronger
affinity. These unique affinities (%RBA) for a given set of ligands
with a protein are specific and sensitive enough to provide a “fingerprint”
when taken holistically. This method can identify perturbations, such
as amino acid transpositions or higher-order structural changes. Values
for %RBA can then be graphed (Scheme 1, top right) for a given sample target with certain
ligand sets. Using this readout, the protein’s structural continuity
can rapidly be confirmed against a fully characterized, competent
protein standard.

Scheme 1 High-Level Workflow of the Chemoprinting Platform
To demonstrate the feasibility
of the method we performed a number
of proof-of-concept experiments using purified enzymes. Initially,
we focused on identifying a library of 100 molecules that generates
a specific binding profile toward four proteins belonging to distinct
enzymatic classes in their native and denatured states. The library
was screened as single compound per well as well as in mixtures of
10 and 25 compounds per well. Subsequently, we tested the feasibility
of using a smaller set of ligands (15) to discern structural differences
between three proteins sharing the same mechanism of action, but deriving
from different species. The successful preliminary outcome encouraged
us to form a library of ligands capable of distinguishing between
three monoclonal antibodies currently in evaluation for therapeutic
purposes. Finally, we further challenged the system to assess its
ability to detect minor conformational perturbations between four
48 kDa protein mutants that differ by only one amino acid residue.

Results
and Discussion
An initial proof-of-concept experiment was
designed to test the
feasibility of the method. For this experiment, four protein targets
were selected which cover a range of functional and structural classes:
bacterial acetyl coenzyme-A carboxylase (carboxy transferase domain,
BACC), human focal adhesion kinase (FAK), human SmyD3 histone methyltransferase
(SmyD3), and human Sirtuin3 (Sirt3). A customized screening library
of 100 compounds was generated using available high-throughput screening
data sets obtained from biochemical assays. Ligands covering a wide
range of potency for each target (pIC50 4.5–8.9)
were included, together with a few negative controls (compounds biologically
inactive against all four targets). These ligand sets were sourced
based on chemical diversity, the minimization of isobars, and the
presence of at least one basic nitrogen atom to provide ready ionization
for MS detection. As shown in the plot in Figure 1, reporting %RBA (y-axis)
of every compound toward each of the four enzymes, the obtained screening
library successfully generated distinctive and reproducible readouts
(Table S1) that were specific for each
native target.11

indicating the relative binding affinity
percentage, %RBA (y-axis), of 100 small molecules
(x-axis) vs BACC (red diamonds), FAK (blue squares),
SmyD3 (orange triangles), and Sirt3 (green dots).

To evaluate the effect of higher throughput on ligand binding
to
a given target, the experiment for BACC was repeated by pooling the
above tested library (100 compounds) in mass-encoded mixtures of 10
and 25 compounds per well. To avoid the likelihood of competitive
binding, the mixtures were tested at a final concentration of 1 μM
while the protein concentration was kept at 10 μM. Ligand binding
was preserved, and the data was reproducible (triplicate) regardless
of the size of the compound pool. The %RBA for the experiment with
25 compounds per well is shown in Figure 2 and includes the associated error bars.
The absolute %RBA, however, varies when the protein is incubated with
a single compound per well or with mixtures of 10 and 25 because the
experiments differ in the ligand/protein ratio and because MS ion
suppression is more likely as the number of compounds increases, thus
changing the %RBA (Figure 2).11

Figure 2 Graphic representation
indicating the relative binding affinity
percentage, %RBA (y-axis), of 23 small molecules
(x-axis) from a library of 100 vs BACC when the library
was tested in mixtures of 25 compounds per well (four wells with 25
compounds per well).

To test the effectiveness of our ligand set in addressing
gross
structural changes within the same target, we tested the 100 compound
library with Sirt3 denatured with 8 M urea. The assay produced a failed
chemoprint, as expected, when compared to the authentic standard chemoprint
generated with native Sirt3 (Figure 3). The same outcome was observed when an acidic solution
(HCl, pH 2.0) was used to denature Sirt3.11

percentage, %RBA (y-axis), of 100 small molecules
(x-axis) vs Sirtuin3 (green dots) in its native state
and in its denatured state (purple squares).

Further exploring the applicability of the method, we challenged
its potential to distinguish between proteins that share the same
biological mechanism but originate from three different species. TrmD
[t-RNA (guanine-N(1)-)-methyltransferase] was evaluated
from both Hemophylus influanzae (a
Gram-negative bacteria) and Streptococcus pnemoniae (a Gram-positive bacteria), whereas Trm5 [t-RNA (guanine(37)-N(1)-methyltransferase] was derived from Homo sapiens. Sequence alignment obtained by ClustalW
indicates a 50% sequence homology between the two bacterial proteins
and approximately 20% between the human and the bacterial targets.
Although there is not a fundamental difference in the catalytic process
between these targets, the amino acid sequence deviations may lead
to alternate binding orientations of the ligands since the residues
available for binding could differ. The three TrmD proteins were assessed
for binding against a set of 15 ligands, which generated a unique
signature in terms of binding affinity and binding intensity for each
target. The graph in Figure 4 summarizes the distinct protein profile generated by comparing
the %RBA (y-axis) of each ligand per protein species.
It is noteworthy that some probes interact with the two bacterial
forms with distinct affinities, while none showed affinity for Trm5.

percentage, %RBA (y-axis), of 15 small molecules
(x-axis) vs TrmD from H. influanzae (orange diamonds), S. pnemoniae (red
dots), and human (dark red triangles).

Next, attention was turned to current antibody products in
the
portfolio at GlaxoSmithKline. After an exercise to identify ligands,
which included screening in-house mass-encoded libraries and literature
compounds, we identified a library which could easily detect differences
between mepolizumab (Nucala), aHER3, and aNOGO (Figure 5). Antigens of Nucala (IL5) and aHER3 (HER3)
were also included as competent members of the set. A control with
a denatured antibody was included in the experiment and showed a rejected
chemoprint, as expected.11 Each chemoprint
is unique, and reproducibility was demonstrated with samples in triplicate.

representation indicating the relative binding affinity
percentage, %RBA (y-axis), of 15 small molecules
(x-axis) vs aNOGO, mepolizumab (Nucala), and aHER3.

To further challenge the robustness
of our chemoprinting platform
in detecting minor conformational perturbations, we focused on a single
protein, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) homodimer. This target
was expressed as the wild type and also as three single-point mutants.
Structural data obtained by superimposing the two monomers of each
dimer indicate an rms difference from 0.29 to 0.40 Å between
Cα atoms, which is suggestive of minor structural variations
between the wild type and the single mutants.12 Despite the conformational similarities between the four proteins,
a library of 15 molecular probes was able to bind to each mutant with
a unique overall “fingerprint”. As summarized in Figure 6, while the compounds
show very weak affinity for the wild-type protein, a distinct chemoprint
is still maintained. Such a distinct profile highlights the power
of this methodology in delivering a unique assay readout from proteins
that differ only by a single-amino-acid transposition.

percentage, %RBA (y-axis), of 15 small molecules
(x-axis) vs IDH1 wild type (navy blue squares) and
mutants R132H (cyano triangles), Y139D (gray diamonds), and G97D (magenta
dots).

Conclusions
A biologic’s
lack of structural continuity between discrete
samples can have dramatic physiological consequences. Because of this,
regulatory agencies are demanding tighter controls on the pharmaceutical
industry’s ability to assess these differences to prevent potential
adverse events in patients. The chemoprinting method described above
allows for the confirmation of higher-order structures of a biologic,
down to single-point mutations. The data provided for this high-throughput
chemoprinting method establishes a foundation for its use with biologics
ranging in molecular weight (MW) and biochemical function since libraries
can easily be assembled to probe specific aspects of higher-order
structure.

Experimental Section
Preparation of Resin for Size Exclusion Chromatography
An amount of 45 g of resin powder (Bio-Rad Bio-Gel P10 fine resin)
was added to a solution of 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5 and 0.02% of sodium
azide and slowly mixed until a suspension was formed. The suspension
was allowed to swell overnight, and the volume was adjusted the day
after to 500 mL.

Preparation of Microtiter Plates for Affinity
Selection Mass
Spectrometry
A traditional ASMS experiment consists in the
preparation of four types of plate\samples.

Size Exclusion Chromatography
Plate
An amount of 130
μL of Bio-Gel P10 resin suspension was added to each well of
a low protein binding Millipore Multiscreen HTS 384 well HV filter
plate (referred here as “size exclusion plate”) with
a 0.45 μm Durapore (PVDF) membrane (no. MZHCN0W10). The plate
was centrifuged at 1000g for 2 min, and the eluent
flow through was discarded.

Compound Stamping
When the experiment was done using
one compound per well, aliquots of 100 nL of 10 mM compound in DMSO
were initially transferred from a master library plate into a 384-well,
clear, polypropylene assay plate using a Labcyte Echo acoustic liquid
handler and backfilled with 100 nL of DMSO.

When the experiment
was done using mixtures of 10 compounds per well, an intermediate
polypropylene plate was prepared by stamping 500 nL of 10 mM DMSO
solution of each compound using a Labcyte Echo acoustic liquid handler
to achieve a final concentration of 1 mM. Aliquots of 20 nL of 1 mM
compound mixture were finally transferred from the intermediate plate
into the assay plate and backfilled with 180 nL of DMSO.

When
the experiment was done using mixtures of 25 compounds per
well, an intermediate plate was prepared by stamping 200 nL of 10
mM DMSO solution of each compound using a Labcyte Echo acoustic liquid
handler to achieve a final concentration of 1 mM. Aliquots of 50 nL
of 1 mM compound mixture were finally transferred from the intermediate
plate into the assay plate and backfilled with 150 nL of DMSO.

Assay
Plate
A stock of protein solution was thawed
using a water bath at room temperature, and then diluted in assay
buffer to 10 μM. An amount of 20 μL of protein solution
was added to the assay plate to give a final concentration of 10 μM
protein and 50 μM compound (when the experiment was done using
one compound per well) or 1 μM (when the experiment was done
using mixtures). Following compound addition, the plate was centrifuged
at 1000g for 2 min. The samples were allowed to incubate
at room temperature for 1 h.

No-Protein Control Plate
A “no-protein control”
plate, consisting in the same set of ligands (or mixtures of ligands)
at the same concentration but without protein target, was also prepared.
The purpose of this control experiment was to check for compounds
that are not properly retained by the size exclusion resin, resulting
in potential bleed-through false positives.

At the end of the
compound–protein incubation, the size exclusion plates were
loaded onto a Bravo automated liquid handling platform (Agilent Technologies).
The platform was used to transfer 50 μL of assay buffer to the
size exclusion plate, which was then centrifuged at 1000g for 2 min. The wash steps were repeated three additional times to
allow resin equilibration. At the end of the washes, the “no-protein
control” plate and the “assay” plate were loaded
onto the Bravo. Amounts of 15 μL of samples were transferred
from the respective sample plate to the size exclusion plate. The
size exclusion plates were centrifuged at 1000g for
2 min, and the flow-through fraction was collected into a 384-well
clear polypropylene plate containing 5 μL of acetonitrile. A
concentration of 25% acetonitrile is used to induce protein precipitation.
Plates were sealed and stored at −80 °C overnight. Finally,
plates were centrifuged at 2000g for 30 min to precipitate
protein prior LC–MS analysis.

Control Plate
The control plate contained the compounds
by themselves to be analyzed by LC–MS. To prepare the control
plate, aliquots of 20 nL of 10 mM compounds in DMSO were transferred
from the master library plate into a 384-well clear polypropylene
plate (Greiner 781280) using a Labcyte Echo acoustic liquid handler
(Labcyte, Inc.) and backfilled with 25 μL of DMSO to obtain
a final compound concentration of 10 μM.

Mixtures of compounds
were prepared as outlined above. The solutions were analyzed by LC–MS.

8-Bromo-7-allyl-1,3-dimethyl xanthine was added to the completed
plates to achieve a final concentration of 10 μM as an internal
standard, allowing us to normalize all measurements, reducing variation
in injections, MS sensitivity, etc.

Liquid Chromatography–Mass
Spectrometry (LC–MS)
All analyses were performed on
a Waters Xevo G2S time-of-flight
MS interfaced with a Waters Acquity I-Class UPLC and MassLynx 4.1
acquisition software. Ten microliter sample injections were made in
partial loop-fill mode on a Waters SM-FL autosampler. LC separation
used a Thermo Hypersil Gold 20 mm × 2.1 mm column with 1.9 μm
particles column, heated to 55 °C. The mobile phase consisted
of water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B), each containing
0.1% formic acid. The LC method consisted of a linear gradient at
1.4 mL/min from 1% to 99% B over 1.8 min, a hold for 0.1 min, and
back to 1% B in 0.01 min. Autosampler time between injections substituted
for column re-equilibration. Approximately one-third of the 1.4 mL/min
flow was directed into the mass spectrometer, and the first 0.1 min
of the gradient containing salts was diverted away. The MS source
was operated in positive-ion, centroided acquisition mode with a source
temperature of 150 °C, capillary voltage of 1 kV, cone voltage
of 80 V, desolvation temperature of 500 °C, cone gas of 175 L/h,
and desolvation gas of 1000 L/h. A leucine/enkephalin lock-mass solution
was infused to apply automated mass correction to all spectra acquired
from 115 to 1300 m/z in 0.1 s.

Data processing was accomplished with custom, in-house software according
to the following automated algorithm. The mass spectrometric, smoothed,
extracted ion chromatogram (XIC) peak areas and heights for each compound
were normalized across plates for an experiment using the peak areas
and heights for the internal standard. The relative binding affinity
percentage (%) was calculated as the percentage normalized XIC peak
area of a compound in the assay plate divided by the normalized XIC
peak area of the same compound in the control plate.
