New diagnostic modalities for malaria
must have high sensitivity
and be affordable to the developing world. We report on a method to
rapidly detect and quantify different stages of malaria parasites,
including ring and gametocyte forms, using attenuated total reflectance
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FT-IR) and partial least-squares
regression (PLS). The absolute detection limit was found to be 0.00001%
parasitemia (<1 parasite/μL of blood; p <
0.008) for cultured early ring stage parasites in a suspension of
normal erythrocytes. Future development of universal and robust calibration
models can significantly improve malaria diagnoses, leading to earlier
detection and treatment of this devastating disease.

==== Body
Malaria,
caused by Plasmodium falciparum, is
one of the most deadly
diseases, resulting in up to 1.2 million fatalities per annum.1 Accurate and early diagnosis followed by immediate
treatment of the infection is essential to reduce mortality2 and prevent overuse of antimalarial drugs. New
technologies to diagnose malaria must be cost-effective and have high
sensitivity and be able to detect circulating stages of the malaria
parasite, namely the ring and gametocyte forms, because these are
the only stages present in peripheral blood circulation. The current
suite of malarial diagnostics in clinical use include (1) optical
microscopy of thick blood films,3,4 (2) rapid diagnostic
tests (RDTs) based on the detection of antigens specific to P. falciparum,5 (3) gene
amplification techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR),6,7 and (4) serological detection tests using antibodies such as immunofluorescence
(IFA)8 and enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA).9 Each method has its own
advantages and disadvantages. For example, PCR is considered the most
sensitive and specific method but it is expensive, requiring a PCR
machine, relatively sophisticated, and requires lengthy procedures,
and thus it is not suitable for malaria diagnosis in remote areas.
Malaria RDTs, which are based on capture of parasite antigens by monoclonal
antibodies incorporated into a test strip, are easy to use but are
unable to quantify parasitemia. A review of existing methods indicates
that the examination of stained blood smears by light microscopy remains
the method of choice for malaria diagnosis because it is inexpensive
and has good sensitivity (5–10 parasites/μL of blood).10−12 However, it is labor-intensive, lengthy, and, more importantly,
requires skilled and experienced microscopists, which is increasingly
burdensome as malaria rates decline with most smears examined being
negative.

During the course of its life the malaria parasite
passes through
several developmental stages including a sexual and an asexual reproductive
pathway. The sexual or progeny phase, which occurs within the gut
of female Anopheles mosquito, produces
numerous infectious forms known as sporozoites that are transferred
to the mosquito salivary glands and injected into the human host during
a blood meal.13 Sporozoites that enter
a blood vessel move to the liver and invade hepatocytes, where they
develop into schizonts, each containing tens of thousands of merozoites.
The merozoites are subsequently released and invade the erythrocytes
initiating the intraerythrocytic asexual phase of the life cycle.
The merozoites grow and divide in the food vacuole and progress through
three distinct morphological phases known as ring, trophozoite, and
schizont stages (Figure 1). Mature-stage parasites
adhere to the vascular endothelium and thus only ring-stage parasites
are observed in blood smears. The schizonts burst, releasing the merozoites,
and the intraerythocytic cycle continues. Instead of replicating,
some merozoites in the erythrocytes develop into sexual forms of the
parasite, called male and female gametocytes, that are capable of
undergoing transmission to mosquitoes. Early-stage gametocytes sequester
away from the peripheral circulation but late-stage gametocytes are
present in blood smears, and gametocyte carriage underpins endemicity
of disease.14 The detection of rings in
peripheral blood is critical for early diagnosis and treatment. The
detection of low levels of gametocytes in asymptomatic long-term malaria
carriers is critical to efforts to eradicate malaria.15

Figure 1 Asexual and sexual phases of the malaria parasite in red blood
cells (RBC). Merozoites invade RBCs and develop through ring, trophozoite
(growing), and schizont (dividing) stages. Some parasites differentiate
to form male and female gametocytes that are capable of transmission
to mosquitoes. Digestion of hemoglobin leads to the accumulation of
hemozoin (Hz). Only ring-stage parasites and late gametocytes are
present in the circulation.

During the intraerythrocytic stages of the parasite’s
life
cycle, P. falciparum endocytoses packets
of host cell cytoplasm, catabolizes the lipids and hemoglobin, and
in the process releases free heme, which is toxic to the organism.
The malaria parasite has evolved a detoxification pathway that uses
the lipid byproducts to catalyze the sequestration of free heme into
an insoluble pigment known as hemozoin (Hz). Synchrotron powder diffraction
analyses have shown that crystals of Hz (and its synthetic equivalent
β-hematin) are composed of a repeating array of iron–carboxylate
interacting heme dimers, stabilized by hydrogen-bonding and π–π
interactions.12,16,17 Given the parasite-specific nature of the Hz production process,
a spectroscopic method that detects hematin (monomeric precursor),
Hz, and/or specific associated lipids could provide an alternative
and early detection method.

Vibrational spectroscopic techniques
have been used extensively
in understanding the molecular and electronic structure of β-hematin
and Hz; however, their application for malaria diagnostics has not
been fully exploited. Raman imaging microscopy has been explored as
a potential nonsubjective method to diagnose malaria parasites on
the basis of strong scattering from the Hz pigment.18 While the technique has shown potential to detect ring
forms of the parasite, the time taken to record an image is on the
order of several hours and therefore not applicable in the clinical
environment. Webster et al.19 investigated
the potential of synchrotron Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) in
combination with principal component analysis (PCA) to differentiate
between intraerythrocytic stages of the parasite life cycle based
on the molecular signatures of Hz and specific lipids. They found
that as the parasite matures from its early ring stage to the trophozoite
and finally to the schizont stage, there is an increase in absorbance
and shifting of specific lipid bands.19 This work demonstrated the potential of using FT-IR spectroscopy
as a diagnostic tool for malaria, but clearly a synchrotron-based
method is not suitable for routine laboratory use. Attenuated total
reflectance (ATR) spectroscopy offers the advantages of potential
portability, is inexpensive, and thus has become a very powerful tool
in the analysis of biological cells and tissues.20−22 A recent study23 compared ATR-FT-IR and Raman microscopy for
investigating human blood plasma/serum obtained from ovarian cancer
patients compared to non-cancer controls. By use of a support vector
machine, diagnostic accuracy of 74% was achieved with Raman, while
the same classifier showed 93.3% accuracy for ATR-IR spectra of blood
plasma, demonstrating the enhanced sensitivity and specificity of
the ATR-FT-IR technique.23 In a second
study24 by the same group, utilizing ATR-FT-IR
to investigate blood plasma from ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer
patients, a classification (up to 96.7%) was achieved for the former,
whereas for endometrial cancer an accuracy (up to 81.7%) was achieved
by use of a support vector machine. It is clear that the ATR-FT-IR
approach has tremendous application in disease diagnosis.

Here
we show for the first time that ATR-FT-IR spectroscopy, in
combination with partial least-squares regression models, has the
required ease of sample preparation, sensitivity, and quantification
ability to become a laboratory standard for malaria detection and
most importantly quantification.

Experimental Methods
The system combines a standard benchtop FT-IR spectrometer and
a diamond crystal ATR accessory. The technique utilizes the property
of total internal reflection to generate an evanescent wave, which
penetrates 2–3 μm into a sample placed in contact with
the 2 × 2 mm diamond crystal face with an active area between
1 and 2 mm2, depending on the wavelength, the refractive
indices of the crystal and the sample, and the angle of incidence
of the infrared beam. An aliquot of packed red blood cells in methanol
is placed on the diamond window of the ATR accessory and rapidly dried
with a blow dryer (1 min). It is important to note that the methanol
is integrally important in obtaining the high sensitivity achieved
with the ATR-FT-IR approach (see below). The whole process of sample
deposition and spectral recording takes less than 3 min with a single
ATR element. An algorithm converts the spectrum into a second derivative
to remove baseline offsets and resolve inflection points in the spectral
bands. The second-derivative spectrum is then run through a partial
least-squares regression model generated by using a calibration set
of spectral standards containing mixtures of normal and infected red
blood cells at different ratios.

Plasmodium Culture and Gametocyte Enrichment
Plasmodium falciparum parasites
(3D7 strain) were
maintained as previously described.25 Briefly,
parasites were maintained in washed O type human RBCs (Red Cross Blood
Bank) and cultured in RPMI-HEPES medium supplemented with 5% human
serum and 0.25% Albumax. The washing step removes the leukocytes.
Parasites were synchronized to ring stages by sorbitol lysis.26 High parasitemia ring-stage cultures were obtained
by seeding uninfected RBCs with purified schizont-stage parasites
that were allowed to reinvade under shaking conditions overnight,
reducing multiple infections.

Parasitemias were calculated by
Giemsa-stained thin blood films; a minimum of 10 fields of view were
counted for each culture. Accurate cell counts were obtained for uninfected
and parasite-infected RBCs through counting on a hemocytometer. The
dilutions were calculated and samples were prepared by diluting parasite-infected
cultures with uninfected RBCs to obtain the desired dilution. All
dilutions were performed in complete culture medium, and samples were
then washed once in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), prior
to fixation with cold methanol (Emparta ACS grade, Merck) on ice (<0
°C) and thorough mixing by pipetting. Samples were stored at
4 °C until analysis.

Parasitemia Series
A series of infected
methanol-fixed
RBCs with cultured parasites at different stages, including rings,
trophozoites, and gametocytes at a range of parasitemia percentages
(Table 1), were used to establish the partial
least-squares (PLS) calibration models. Uninfected methanol-fixed
RBCs were used as the control (0% parasitemia).

Equipment and Spectral
Data Acquisition for ATR-FT-IR Measurements
A Bruker model
Equinox 55 (Bruker Optic, Ettingen, Germany) FT-IR
spectrometer fitted with a N2-cooled mercury–cadmium–telluride
(MCT) detector and a golden gate diamond ATR accessory (Specac Limited,
Orpington, Kent, U.K.) was used for spectral acquisition. The Bruker
system was controlled with an IBM-compatible PC running OPUS version
6.0 software. For each sample spectrum, an aliquot (200 μL)
of packed fixed cells was placed on the diamond cell and air-dried
with a blow dryer. Spectra were collected with a spectral resolution
of 8 cm–1 and 32 coadded interferograms ratioed
against a clean diamond background. For each sample deposit, 3–5
replicate spectra were recorded to assess precision and ensure the
reproducibility of each sample spectrum.

Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing of the spectral data
was performed in OPUS (Bruker Optic, Ettingen, Germany) and Unscrambler
X (version 10.0.1, Camo Software, Oslo, Norway) software packages.
For optimal modeling, raw spectra were vector-normalized and the second
derivative was calculated by use of the Savitzky–Golay algorithm
with nine smoothing points.

Principal Component Analysis
PCA
was performed by use
of The Unscrambler (Camo Software, Oslo, Norway) on second derivatives
in the CH stretching region (3100–2800 cm–1), by use of the leave-out-one cross-validation approach and Nipal’s
algorithm for PCA decomposition. Six PCs were chosen for the initial
decomposition and 20 iterations were performed for each PC. Two-dimensional
(2D) (PC1 versus PC2) scores plots and the corresponding PC1 and PC2
loading plots were graphed.

Partial Least Squares
PLS was also
performed by use
of The Unscrambler (Camo Software, Oslo, Norway) on second derivatives
in the CH stretching region (3100–2800 cm–1), by use of the leave-out-one prediction approach. Partial least-squares
discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) finds a linear regression model by
projecting the predicted variables and the observable variables to
a new space. A separate column was designated the category variable,
which included the percentage parasitemia in this case. The regression
plot and associated regression coefficients were plotted. The number
of factors in the analysis varied from 6 to 8 latent factors. The
number of factors was determined by the “goodness of fit”
and analysis of the regression coefficients to ensure that the coefficients
were based on real spectral bands and not spurious artifacts.

Results
and Discussion
Fixative Selection Study
A preliminary
study was carried
out to explore the application of ATR-FT-IR spectroscopy in RBCs.
The aim was to optimize fixative types and explore spectral variations
during storage times. Ethanol, methanol, and formaldehyde fixatives
were examined in the study. Methanol proved to be the best fixative
for the ATR application because it resulted in more consistent spectra
compared to glutaraldehyde and ethanol (over a month of storage) and
the cells are easily separated from fixative without centrifugation.

Another advantage of methanol is that it evaporates rapidly under
a blow dryer and leaves no chemical residues. Air-drying or fixing
cells with glutaraldehyde does not achieve the same sensitivity and
accurate quantification. Methanol may also assist in forcing dissolved
lipids to the surface of the ATR crystal, especially when under pressure
from the sample-clamping device. It is important to note that methanol
would dissolve some lipids but not all. Moreover, we do not remove
the supernatant when we centrifuge down the cells, so the dissolved
lipids would remain in the supernatant and would be mixed with the
pellet of lysed cells because of the higher molecular weight of the
lipids compared to methanol. We calculate that the ATR method detects
lipid residues and Hz deposits from approximately 100 parasites on
the ATR diamond crystal face at 0.00001% parasitemia (see Supporting Information).

Spectral Precision/Reproducibility
Replicate spectra
(30 in total from 6 sample deposits × 5 spectra/deposit) were
obtained from all RBC samples to ensure that representative ATR-FT-IR
spectra were collected after the sample was air-dried. After preprocessing
(normalization and derivative calculation), statistical tests were
performed over the range of replicate spectra (600–4000 cm–1) by use of Unscrambler X software. Descriptive statistics
data, including variance and standard deviations, were used to assess
the reproducibility of the IR spectra. As an example, replicate spectra
(30 replicates) of the control sample showed a mean absorbance variance
of 0.0005. This confirmed the applicability of the method used for
deposition and drying of the sample deposit on the diamond crystal
face and indicated that spectra of the dried sample deposits are robust
and reproducible.

Overlaid Average Spectra
Replicate
second-derivative
spectra from each stage of the parasite’s life cycle at different
parasitemia percentages were averaged (by use of the reduced-average
option in Unscrambler X software) and overlaid (Figure 2).

Figure 2 ATR-FT-IR average second-derivative spectra for infected RBCs (ring,
trophozoite, and gametocyte stages of parasite) and uninfected RBCs
(control) of the C–H stretching region and the Hz band marker
range.

Replicate ATR-FT-IR spectra from
different stages of parasite-infected
RBCs with the highest available parasitemia percentages [i.e., ring
(30%), trophozoite (80%), and gametocyte (40%) as well as control
(0%) samples] were obtained. Figure 2 shows
the averaged second-derivative overlaid spectra of the C–H
stretching region (3100–2800 cm–1) as well
as the 1800–900 cm–1 region highlighting
the important Hz marker bands for infected RBCs from different parasite
stages. In the second-derivative spectra, the absorbance maxima become
minima; therefore, in Figure 2 the +ve intensities
for absorbance spectra become −ve for second-derivative spectra.
The CH stretching region (3100–2800 cm–1)
is optimally diagnostic for different stages of the parasite as previously
shown with synchrotron FT-IR spectroscopy.19 There is also evidence for contributions from nucleic acids, as
evidenced by the phosphodiester marker bands including the asymmetric
stretch at 1241 cm–1 and the symmetric stretch at
1095 cm–1. The C–O stretching vibration from
the propionate group from Hz expected around 1208–1215 cm–1 is observed as a shoulder feature in the second-derivative
spectra of trophozoites and to a lesser extent in the gametocytes.
In terms of diagnostic capability, use of the CH stretching region
was found to achieve higher sensitivity compared to the 1800–950
cm–1 region and a combination of both regions.

Principal Component Analysis
PCA was performed on all
the replicate RBC samples from individual stages of the parasite life
cycle following spectral data preprocessing. PCA is one of the most
powerful exploratory tools for large data-set analysis. PCA reduces
the dimensionality of the data set by decomposing the data set into
a signal and noise part by finding linear combinations of the original
variables. PCA was applied to second-derivative ATR-FT-IR spectra
from infected RBCs including the ring trophozoite and gametocyte stages
as well as the control samples (uninfected RBCs) with the aim of assessing
spectral variance across a subpopulation of cells.

Figure 3 (a) PCA scores plot along
PC1 and PC2 of control (C) and ring (R),
trophozoite (T), and gametocyte (G) -infected RBC data sets. (b) PC1
correlation loadings plot after a second-derivative function was applied
to the C–H stretching region (3100–280 cm–1).

Figure 3a indicates a clear differentiation
and sample grouping for the different stages of parasitemia (i.e.,
R, T, and G) from infected RBCs compared to the control (C) in the
C–H stretching region. Ring-stage parasites that are to the
right of the scores plot have a large positive PC1 value compared
to all other stages, indicating significant differences in the lipid
composition compared to the other stages. The linear subgroupings
observed in the clusters arise from the fact that a series of concentrations
were used as input data into the PCA. In the ring stage, four independent
series were included in the PCA model. The loadings plot (Figure 3b) shows a combination CH stretching bands from
protein, lipid, and hemozoin and hence the loadings appear broad shifted
compared to the expected position of the normal lipid modes.

PCA analysis was also applied to the 1800–1000 cm–1 region for all stages where the Hz bands are expected (∼1712,
1664, and 1209 cm–1)19 (data not shown). However, only good rather than excellent separation
of trophozoites and gametocytes from the control was achieved. The
ring-stage parasites could not be as definitively separated from the
other groups when using this spectral window because the rings only
have very small amounts of Hz. The definitive separation in the PCA
scores plot along with the linearity observed in the subgroupings
because of the different percentages of parasitemia demonstrates that
the CH stretching region (3100–2800 cm–1)
is ideal for PLS prediction models.

ATR-FT-IR Sensitivity in
PCA Analysis
In order to examine
the sensitivity of ATR-FT-IR to differentiate parasitemia at very
low levels, PCA analysis was applied to second-derivative spectra
at the lowest percentage parasitemia in each sample series for both
rings and trophozoites versus control (as 0%). Figure 4 shows an example of the PCA analysis at 0.00001% parasitemia
for rings versus control in the C–H stretching region (3100–2800
cm–1).

Figure 4 (a) PCA scores plot and (b) PC1 correlation
loadings plot along
PC1 and PC2 of control 0% (−1) and rings 0.00001% (+1), after
a second-derivative function was applied to the C–H stretching
region (3100–280 cm–1).

In Figure 4 the scores plot indicates
good
separation or grouping of rings at 0.00001% parasitemia (the lowest
concentration prepared in the ring series) versus control. The loadings
plot for PC1 shows strong negative loadings in the lipid band regions
of 2854, 2954–2944, 2993, and 3063 cm–1.
Similar analysis was also performed for the gametocyte and trophozoite
series at 0.09% and 0.5% (the lowest concentrations available), respectively,
versus control, which exhibited excellent separation between gametocytes,
trophozoites, and controls. The results confirm the ability of ATR-FT-IR
to detect parasitemia levels down to 0.00001%. The same type of PCA
analysis was performed in the Hz region (1800–900 cm–1); however, no separation was observed, indicating the Hz region
is ineffective for diagnosing low levels of parasitemia.

PLS Models
Partial least-squares (PLS) regression is
a statistical method that develops a linear regression model by projecting
the predicted variable (% parasitemia) and the observable variable
(spectra) onto a new multidimensional space. For ring-stage parasitemia,
three PLS models were constructed for three ranges of parasitemia
(at the ring stage) from three independent trials: namely, model 1
(10–30%), model 2 (0–5%), and model 3 (0–1%)
with the lowest detectable parasitemia at 0.00001%. The PLS model
is based on a full cross-validation model where one sample is left
out and then the parasitemia of that sample is predicted. The corresponding
root-mean-square error of validation (RMSEV) and R2 values for each model are 2.50 and 0.94 for model 1,
0.32 and 0.95 for model 2, and 0.07 and 0.95 for model 3. The spectra
presented in Figure 5 show an example set of
calibration standards for the ring-stage parasites that was used to
build the PLS regression model. To generate the final models, we incorporated
calibration data from three independent trials. The regression plots
for calibration and validation sets are shown in Figure 6, along with the corresponding regression coefficient plots
for 8-factors. The maxima and minima bands in the regression coefficient
plots show the bands that are important in generating linearity in
the model. These correspond to the major bands associated with lipid
CH stretching vibrations (Figure 6). Thus,
the linearity of the model is based on real spectral changes and not
spectral artifacts such as baseline modulations or noise. There is
some variation in the intensity of the CH stretching bands in the
regression plots (Figure 6D–F) between
the various concentration ranges. This variation arises from the gametocytes,
which cannot be totally removed from the preparations. As can be seen
in Figure 2, the spectra of gametocytes show
a very different lipid profile compared to the other stages. This
is more evident in the 1–5% range, but nonetheless the regression
plots reveal that the regression fit is based primarily on the important
CH2 and CH3 stretching vibrations from ring
and to a lesser extent the gametocytes. We found the best predictions
were obtained when using the lipid CH stretching region (3100–2800
cm–1) as opposed to the 1800–900 cm–1 region, where the majority of bands are present.

spectra, showing the type
of data used in generation of calibration models.

ranges of early ring-stage parasitemia: (A) model 1 (%) 0, 10, 15,

3 (%) 0, 0.00001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8, and
1. Also shown are the corresponding regression coefficient plots (panels
D–F, respectively) for 8-factors.

Earlier studies have also reported unique lipids associated
with
the malaria parasite. Studies have shown that neutral lipids accumulate
in the digestive compartment and in neutral lipid bodies during parasite
development.27−29 Images of parasites at the ring stage show small
Hz crystals surrounded by neutral lipid spheres inside the digestive
vacuole, compared to a thinner rim of lipids that surrounds a much
larger Hz crystal at the later trophozoite stage.28 Jackson et al.27 demonstrated
that neutral lipid bodies contain di- and triacylglycerols and hypothesized
that these structures act as storage compartments for lipid byproducts
formed by phospholipid digestion in the parasite’s digestive
vacuole. The Hz aliphatic and aromatic CH vibrations also contribute
to this lipid spectral region, enhancing the overall sensitivity of
the technique.

By use of the same method for each series of
infected RBCs at different
stages and percentages of parasitemia, a range of optimum regression
models were obtained for both lipid and Hz band ranges with the minimum
number of factors and highest model fitness. Results indicated that
spectral preprocessing and removal of outliers improved the correlation
coefficient between predicted and measured values at lower factors,
which gives the optimized model with minimum error to be considered
as the “best” theoretical fit. The results with second
derivatives also indicated further improvement because lower factors
were required to achieve high correlation coefficients.

In addition
to the above final models from large data sets, a summary
of the results from optimum PLS models at C–H stretching region
on RBCs of different parasitemia series and at different stages of
parasitic life cycle is given in Table 2. It
summarizes all the prediction models applied to the ATR-FT-IR spectra
of ring, trophozoite, and gametocyte series as well as combinations
of all the series from different stages of parasitemia after application
of data preprocessing to each model. Even for digitally mixed samples—that
is, mixing spectra of rings (R), trophozoites (T), gametocytes (G),
and controls (C)—an excellent R2 value (0.96–0.97) was achieved for the 0–5% parasitemia
range.

of PLS Prediction Models to Unknown/Blind Samples
To assess
the applicability and sensitivity of the PLS models,
optimized PLS prediction models from low ranges of parasitemia series
(0–5%, 0–0.1%, and 5–10%) were used to predict
parasitemia concentration of a series of infected RBCs with rings
as unknown or blind samples.

Replicate spectra (10–15)
of the unknown samples were preprocessed in the same way as the reference
samples and used for PLS prediction. PLS models from ring series (with R2> 0.99 and RMSE <0.17) as well as from
combined
spectra from all series were used for predictions. Figure 7 indicates an example of predictions where ring
samples at 7% and 7.4% parasitemia were used as unknown and a PLS
model in the range of 5–10% parasitemia was used; the average
standard error of the prediction-deviations was 0.08% at factor 1.

Figure 7 Example
of predictions for unknown samples using PLS models in
the range of 5–10% with average standard error of prediction
of 0.08. Predicted values are shown as horizontal lines, and the boxes
around predicted value indicate the deviation.

More ring samples with parasitemia levels in the range of
0–2
were also used as unknowns. The average predicted concentrations of
the ring samples were all within 0–2% with average error of
0.2 (Hotelling T2 at 95% confidence limit).
Predictions for the unknown samples with <0.1% parasitemia showed
an average standard deviation of 0.05.

The reasons for the prediction
variation, especially at low parasitemia
levels, could be due to (1) varying number of infected cells deposited
on the ATR diamond cell that may have caused nonuniformity in lipid
distribution in the dried-sample deposits, (2) varying thickness of
the lipid deposit at the crystal surface, and (3) error involved in
sample preparation (e.g., separation and dilution) and the reference
method. Sample uniformity, particle size, and consistency in sample
thickness on the diamond cell were found to be the most important
factors in obtaining consistent spectral acquisition and error reduction
for prediction of unknown samples. The sensitivity of predictions
for quantification was found to be 0.2% within 95% confidence limit.
It is important to note that the absolute detection limit is 0.00001%,
but the actual quantification sensitivity limit is 0.1% with a 0.05
standard deviation.

Conclusion
Here we have demonstrated
the potential of ATR FT-IR spectroscopy
as an alternative method for rapid detection and quantification of
malaria parasite infections. There is no cell counting or chemical
treatment other than methanol fixation required, sample preparation
is minimal and simple, and the analysis time is reduced to <3 min/sample
when a single-chamber ATR device is used. The next phase will see
the trial of imaging ATR devices for rapid multiple measurements applied
to clinical samples.
