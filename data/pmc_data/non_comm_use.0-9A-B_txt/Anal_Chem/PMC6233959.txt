Although
single-cell mRNA sequencing has been a powerful tool to explore cellular
heterogeneity, the sequencing of small RNA at the single-cell level
(sc-sRNA-seq) remains a challenge, as these have no consensus sequence,
are relatively low abundant, and are difficult to amplify in a bias-free
fashion. We present two methods of single-cell-lysis that enable sc-sRNA-seq.
The first method is a chemical-based technique with overnight freezing
while the second method leverages on-chip electrical lysis of plasma
membrane and physical extraction and separation of cytoplasmic RNA
via isotachophoresis. We coupled these two methods with off-chip small
RNA library preparation using CleanTag modified adapters to prevent
the formation of adapter dimers. We then demonstrated sc-sRNA-seq
with single K562 human leukemic cells. Our approaches offer a relatively
short hands-on time of 6 h and efficient generation of on-target reads.
The sc-sRNA-seq with our approaches showed detection of miRNA with
various abundances ranging from 16 000 copies/cell to about
10 copies/cell. We anticipate this approach will create a new opportunity
to explore cellular heterogeneity through small RNA expression.

==== Body
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
is a growing field with a wide range of associated methods.1 scRNA-seq offers unique advantages of exploring
heterogeneity among cells leveraging high-dimensional transcriptomic
data.2 The methods also enable assaying
rare cells such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs)3 or fine needle aspirate biopsies4 and help the development of an understanding of tissue composition,
transcription dynamics, and gene regulation.5

A variety of microfluidic devices have been applied to single-cell
transcriptomics as they offer a range of advantages including reducing
the need for highly trained personnel,6 reducing measurement uncertainty by improving reproducibility, saving
time and resources, and enabling higher throughput and automation.7 Devices and processes range from cell sorting
to systems with high degrees of automation including scRNA-seq library
preparation.8 Further, microfluidics has
been applied to the study of subcellular transcriptomic distribution
by separating the cytoplasmic RNA content from the nuclear content.9−12 Recently, Abdelmoez et al.13 were able
to physically separate the nucleus from the cytoplasmic content by
using a microfluidic chip which traps the cell, electrically lyses
the plasma membrane, and then electrophoretically transports the cytoplasmic
content away from the trapped nucleus using isotachophoresis (ITP).

An important exception to these advances in scRNA-seq, and the
main focus of the current work, is the processing, isolation, and
deep sequencing of small RNA (sRNA-seq) of single cells. To date,
sRNA profiling has been restricted to a large number of cells.14−17 This limitation is due mostly to the relatively low abundance of
sRNAs compared to mRNAs, and also the large variation in sRNA expression
depending on the type and state of the cells. Another important challenge
in single-cell sRNA-seq (sc-sRNA-seq) is the formation of adapter
dimers during library preparation. sRNA library preparation involves
ligating adapters to the sRNA to enable amplification of the library
for downstream sequencing, but low input RNA amounts imply that adapters
often ligate to themselves and create empty library components known
as adapter dimers.

To our knowledge, the only successful attempt
of sc-sRNA-seq was the work by Faridani et al.18 The work reported sequencing of micro RNAs (miRNAs), sno-derived
sRNAs(sdRNAs), and tRNA derived sRNAs (tsRNAs) with single naïve
and primed human embryonic stem cells and cancer cells. The work also
demonstrated segregating different cell types with sRNA expression.
Shore et al.19 reported a method for sRNA-seq
library preparation using chemically modified adaptors, which we here
term as CleanTag. CleanTag enables sRNA-seq with single-cell-quantity
RNA (10 pg) by suppressing the formation of adaptor dimers and offers
a simple workflow with a relatively short hands-on time of about 6
h. However, we know of no report that couples CleanTag with single-cell
lysis and demonstrates sc-sRNA-seq.

In this work, we report
two single-cell lysing techniques that enable sc-sRNA-seq coupled
with CleanTag-based library construction. The first technique uses
a mild detergent with temperature variation for single-cell lysing.
The second uses a microfluidic device which electrically lyses the
plasma membrane and extracts the cytoplasmic nucleic acids of a single
cell. Each technique robustly enables sc-sRNA-seq with CleanTag for
the first time and provides sRNA expressions that correlate well with
published studies. To develop our sc-sRNA-seq techniques, we explored
four different lysis approaches coupling with CleanTag and critically
benchmarked the yield of on-target reads, sensitivity, and reproducibility.
Our approach offers a much simpler work flow, shorter hands-on time
(6 h versus 18 h by Faridani et al.18),
and superiority regarding a greater library yield and reduced amounts
of adapter dimers.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
We purchased
Tris, HEPES, Imidazole, and HCl from Thermo Fisher Scientific and
polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, MW 1 MDa) from Sigma-Aldrich. The leading
electrolyte (LE) buffer was composed of 50 mM Tris and 25 mM HCl containing
0.4% PVP at pH 8.1. The trailing electrolytes (TE) buffer was 50 mM
Imidazole and 25 mM HEPES containing 0.4% PVP at pH 7.6. All solutions
were prepared in DNase-/RNase-free deionized (DI) water (Life Technologies).

Cell Culture
We used K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia)
cells in our single-cell experiments. K562 cells were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium with 4.5 g/L glucose, l-glutamine, and sodium pyruvate (Thermo Fisher). Fetal bovine
serum and penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine were added to the media
with 10% and 1% of volumetric concentrations, respectively. The cells
were cultured at a temperature of 37 °C with 5% CO2.

Microfluidic Chip
We used the microfluidic chip design reported
by Abdelmoez et al.13 Briefly, the microchannel
included a T-junction layout with a hydrodynamic trap immediately
upstream the junction. The trap had a 3 μm-wide gap and was
5 μm long. The main channel for ITP had a width of 50 μm
and depth of 25 μm. The three microchannels were, respectively,
connected to 3 mm-diameter wells: an inlet, an outlet, and a waste.
The device was made of polydimethylsiloxane (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning)
using soft lithography and sealed with a glass slide by plasma bonding.

Single-Cell Lysis with a Chemical Agent
To lyse a single
cell in Triton X-100, 1 μL of cell suspension containing a single
cell was added to 3 μL of lysis buffer composed of 0.13% Triton
X-100 with 4 units of RNase inhibitor (SUPERaseIn RNase inhibitor,
Invitrogen) in a PCR tube and stored at −80 °C at least
overnight. In our preliminary experiments, we also examined lyses
with the same Triton X-100 chemistry but without freezing overnight.

In addition, we examined an off-the-shelf single-cell lysis kit
(Ambion Single-Cell Lysis Kit) for comparison. A volume of 1 μL
of cell suspension containing a single cell was added to 5 μL
of the lysis buffer and incubated for 5 min after which 1 μL
of the kit’s stop buffer was added.

Single-Cell Lysis Using
Microfluidics Based Approach
Each microfluidic chip was used
once to avoid introducing any contamination. At the start of each
experiment, the microchannels were washed with 1 M NaOH supplemented
with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min, then with 1 M HCl supplemented with
0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min, and deionized (DI) water supplemented
with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min. This was accomplished by filling
the inlet and outlet wells with the aforementioned washing solution
then applying a vacuum at the waste well. We note that Triton X-100
was used to prevent bubble formation in the microchannel and was removed
completely by exchanging the solution in the microchannel with LE
and TE.

After washing, 10 μL of LE was loaded in the outlet
well and 10 μL of TE was loaded in the inlet well and we briefly
applied vacuum to the waste well. A 1 μL aliquot of cell suspension
manually observed to contain a single cell (with a microscope during
its pipetting from a Petri dish) was added to the inlet well. The
capture of the single cell at the trap via a pressure-driven flow
from the inlet to the waste was visualized using an optical microscope.
Then, 10 μL of TE was loaded into the waste well to reduce the
pressure-driven flow. Platinum wire electrodes were inserted into
the three wells and two source meters (2410, Keithley) were used to
apply, respectively, −150, −170, and 0 V to the electrodes
at the inlet, waste, and outlet wells. The dc voltage caused the plasma
membrane lysis within 0.1 s and initiated ITP extracting the cytoplasmic
nucleic acid content away from the lysed cell, focusing the nucleic acids contents into the TE/LE
interface, and transporting it toward the outlet well within 2 min. Detailed
description of a similar protocol and chip, together with a narrated
video description, were reported by Kuriyama et al.11

Library Preparation and Sequencing
The library preparation protocol was as follows: CleanTag Small RNA
Library Preparation Kit (TriLink BioTechnologies, LLC) (catalog no.
L-3206) was used to prepare all 24 sRNA libraries. Manufacturer’s
recommended protocol19 was followed with
a few changes (see Table S-1). Briefly,
the first step was ligation of the 3′ adapter onto the RNA
of interest with incubation for 1 h at 28 °C and heat deactivation
at 65 °C for 20 min. Next step was ligation of the 5′ adapter on the RNA library for 1 h at 28 °C followed by heat deactivation at 65 °C for 20 min. We synthesized cDNA (1 h at 50 °C) and amplified it via PCR (98 °C for 30 s; temperature cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 15 s; and 72 °C at 10 min) with Illumina standard barcoding index primers (no. L-3204 and no. L-3205 TriLink BioTechnologies, LLC). Note that the number
of cycles can be found in Table S-1. FirstChoice
Human Leukemia (K562) Total RNA (Life Technologies) was used in control
experiments at input amounts of 100 ng or 10 pg. All PCR products
(80–86 μL) were purified using 144 μL of Ampure
XP (Beckman Coulter) magnetic beads to eliminate products shorter
than 100 base pairs. No size-selection via Ampure XP was performed
to avoid loss of material. Purified libraries were analyzed by a 2100
Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) where the samples were
diluted 1:3. Libraries were also quantified by a Qubit 3.0 fluorometer
(Thermo Fisher) dsDNA HS Assay kit. Twenty-four samples were pooled
to occupy equal space on the flow cell. Based on the concentration
of the sample, a final mixture of 10 nM with each sample comprising
0.416 nM was prepared. High-throughput sequencing was performed on
an Illumina HiSeq 2500 with single-end 50 nt by GENWIZ (La Jolla,
CA).

Data Analysis
To compare the protocols at a similar
sequencing depth, some of the reads were first down-sampled to make
the average depth of the individual protocol 9.58 M reads using Seqtk20 (see Table S-2).
Next, the adapter sequence (TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG) was trimmed and
reads shorter than 15 nt were discarded by cutadapt (version 1.14)
with the following parameters: -e 0.1 -O 1 -u 2 −minimum-length
15. Afterward, reads aligned to rRNA (rRNA) sequences (human_all_rRNA.fasta21) were discarded using STAR (version 2.5.3a).22 The remaining reads were then aligned to the
human genome (hg38) also using STAR with parameters of ENCODE miRNA-seq
project.23 Finally, expressions of transcripts
in counts per million reads (CPM) were estimated with the following
databases (UCSC Genome Browser for tRNA and ENSEMBL for other transcripts).
The multiple-aligned reads were assigned to the multiple genomic locations
by a weighing approach, dividing the number of reads by the number
of annotated locations.18,24

Note that the
RNA length cutoff value used when analyzing the sc-sRNA-seq data in
the manuscript was 15 nt, with the exception in the section entitled Quality of Sequencing Reads which used a cutoff
at 18 nt in order to compare our results with the available data on
sc-sRNA-seq.18 Differential RNA analysis
was performed using Monocole software.25

Results and Discussion
Overview of sc-sRNA-seq with CleanTag
In this work, we report two approaches of single-cell lyses for sc-sRNA-seq
coupled with CleanTag small RNA library preparation. The first technique
depends on the chemical lysis of single cells with the mild detergent
Triton X-100 and freezing overnight at −80 °C (Figure 1A). The second technique
uses a microfluidic chip that selectively lyses the plasma membrane
extracting the cytoplasmic RNA through the application of electric
current as described in the methods and previous publications (Figure 1B).13 Both methods take about 6 h of hands-on time for the library
construction, while the microfluidic approach offers a significantly
faster protocol for lysis and extraction of cytoplasmic RNA (∼5
min) than lysis with Triton X-100 (∼12 h). Furthermore, the
microfluidic approach facilitates the separation of nuclear and cytoplasmic
RNA (including small RNA) with minimal cross-contamination.13 The chip can save and recover the nucleus of
each cell (see also the work of Abdelmoez et al.,13 although the cell’s nuclei were not analyzed in
the current work.) We demonstrated sc-sRNA-seq coupled with CleanTag19 with these two methods and critically benchmarked
the sensitivity and repeatability of sRNA quantification.

lyses for sc-sRNA-seq with CleanTag library preparation: (A) lysis
via 0.13% Triton X-100 and freezing overnight (∼12 h) and (B)
electrical lysis and ITP-based extraction of cytoplasmic RNA (∼5
min). Both samples are processed with CleanTag small RNA library prep
(6 h).

Single-Cell Lyses for CleanTag
To find an appropriate cell-lysis approach, we explored various
methods of single-cell lyses including off-the-shelf single-cell lysis
kit from Ambion, Triton X-100, and the microfluidic approach. We examined
two conditions of Triton-based lysis: with and without an overnight
incubation at −80 °C. Among these approaches, we observed
successful library construction using two approaches, Triton X-100
with an overnight incubation at −80 °C and using the microfluidic
approach (Figure 2).
The electropherogram in Figure 2 showed that a variety of RNA products were detected including
miRNA around 140 nt and adapter dimers around 120 nt. Single-cell
samples generated between 5 ng/μL and 60 ng/μL of purified
DNA with the CleanTag library preparation kit (cf. Figure S-1 in the Supporting Information). In contrast, we observed
no detectable library peaks with the other two single-cell lysis approaches
as shown in Figure S-2. In this paper,
we thus used the overnight freezing for Triton-based lysis unless
we explicitly specify the condition. For reference, we included electropherograms
of 10 pg and 100 ng of bulk samples in Figure S-2C,D, respectively.

Bioanalyzer for products of the CleanTag library preparation. (A)

overnight-freezing and for (B) on-chip ITP extracted single K562 cell
cytoplasmic RNA. Both electropherograms show abundant content ranging
from 120 to 150 nt, consistent with ligated mature small RNA molecules.

Quality of Sequencing Reads
To elucidate the quality of the sRNA-seq reads, we analyzed the
composition of raw reads as shown in Figure 3. We here summarized the off-target reads
for sRNA-seq as three categories: too short reads (<18 nt), unmapped
reads, and reads aligned on rRNAs. We also divided the on-target reads
for sRNA-seq into uniquely mapped reads and multiple mapped reads.
We observed the Triton-based and the microfluidics-based lyses, respectively,
yielded 17% and 4% of on-target reads. We hypothesize that the difference
in the fraction of the on-target reads is due to the different reaction
volumes, resulting in slightly different buffer conditions. As summarized
in Table S-1, our protocols output different
volumes respectively as 4 μL, 8 μL, and 2 μL (including
1 μL of nuclease-free water) with Triton, microfluidics, and
10 pg of bulk samples, which resulted in 12, 16, and 10 μL of
reaction volumes by adding 8 μL of the adapter ligation master
mix at the 3′ adaptor ligation step. To compare our approach to
the protocol by Faridani et al.,18 we applied
the same in silico analyses to the sRNA-seq data and obtained 5% of
on-target reads as shown in Figure 3C. This comparison showed that CleanTag with Triton-based
lysis yielded the highest fraction of on-target reads among the three
methods. (Note the data by Faridani et al.18 were created with different cells, HEK293FT, than our K562 cells.)
We also compared the performance of the CleanTag-based sRNA-seq with
10 pg and 100 ng of total RNA versus those by Faridani et al.18 as shown in Figure S-3. We again observed a better performance with the CleanTag-based
approach, yielding more fractions of on-target reads. Notably, we
observed that CleanTag increased the on-target reads by reducing too
short reads, which we attribute to the suppression of adapter dimer
formation. These quality control results could suggest that the use
of the CleanTag sc-sRNA-seq has an advantage over the method described
by Faridani et al.18 in efficient generation
of on-target reads.

Figure 3 Composition of sequencing reads obtained with two lyses
protocols, (A) Triton and (B) microfluidics-based approaches (single
K562 cells), and (C) that obtained with data from Faridani et al.18 (single HEK293FT cells).

Detection of Small RNAs
Our sc-sRNA-seq protocols consistently
detected both pre-sRNAs and mature sRNAs as shown in Figure 4A,B, respectively. Both Triton
and microfluidics-based lyses showed similar numbers of detected sRNAs
with control experiments using 10 pg of total RNA. Our approaches
detected similar numbers of sRNAs per cell to those of Faridani et
al.18 However, the quantitative comparison
is difficult due to the different cell types. We confirmed the detection
of the sRNAs assessing the length of the aligned reads as shown in Figure 4C–E. As similar
to the results by Faridani et al.,18 we
observed peaks in the distributions of read length at 22 nt, 33 nt,
and 39 nt, respectively, with miRNA, tsRNA, and sdRNA(<40 nt).
Interestingly, our method detected specifically mature miRNAs more
than their precursors whereas our method detected other precursors
of tRNAs and snoRNAs. For reference, we included the distribution
of length of mapped reads with 100 ng of bulk in Figure S-4. The distributions of aligned reads on respective
precursors further evidenced detection of sRNAs showing that the mature
RNAs derived from specific loci of precursors (Figure S-5). We note that our protocol also consistently detected
other types of sRNAs as shown in Figure S-6, while we mainly discuss miRNA, tsRNA, and sdRNA in detail in this
work.

Figure 4 Characterization of sc-sRNA-seq approaches using single K562 cells:
(A) number of precursor RNAs (pre-miRNAs, tRNAs, snoRNAs) and (B)
number of mature sRNAs (miRNAs, tsRNAs, and sdRNAs) detected with
Triton and microfluidic-based lyses and single-cell-quantity total
RNA (10 pg) extracted from K562 cells. (C–E) Length distribution
of aligned reads on miRNA, tRNA, and snoRNA. (F) Pearson correlation
in all combinations of replicate sample pairs prepared with the same
method. (G) Pearson correlation of sRNA expression to control experiments
with 100 ng of total RNA.

To assess reproducibility of the sRNAs detection, we compared
the number of sRNAs detected in all combinations of replicate sample
pairs prepared with the same method to the mean total number of sRNAs
detected using that method. Single-cell samples showed reproducibility
between 63% and 76% and no significant difference from 10 pg of bulk
samples, whereas the 100 ng of bulk samples showed higher reproducibility
between 90% and 96% (see Figure S-7). We
thus hypothesize that the main source of variability in single-cell
samples is due to the small amount of RNA.

Repeatability of Small
RNA Quantification
We next assessed the repeatability of
the sRNAs quantification by analyzing the Pearson correlation in all
combinations of replicate sample pairs prepared with the same method
as shown in Figure 4F. In contrast to Faridani et al.,18 in
which they reported significantly low coefficients of correlation
with miRNAs, we observed that coefficients of correlation ranged from 0.6
to 0.9 with all three sRNAs and no apparent difference among the protocols.
In this analysis, we included control experiments with single-cell
RNA quantities, 10 pg, to discern the increase in the technical uncertainty
due to the lysis. The similar coefficients of correlation with the
control experiments supported the repeatability of our single-cell
lysis. We also examined the correlation of the sRNA expression to
control experiments with 100 ng of total RNA as shown in Figure 4G and observed that coefficients
of correlation roughly ranged from 0.5 to 0.8. These results suggest
that neither the Triton nor the microfluidics-based approaches introduced
adverse effects on the CleanTag chemistry. In Figure S-8, we showed the overall coefficients of correlation
including those across different protocols using all of the sRNA species.
The hierarchical analysis showed that Triton (scTriton) and microfluidics-based
(scITP) sc-sRNA-seq data are closer to each other than to the data
with 10 pg of total RNA.

Difference in Triton vs Microfluidics Methods
To elucidate the difference between Triton and microfluidic-based
methods, we performed differential expression (DE) analysis comparing
both sc-sRNA-seq data versus 10 pg of total RNA shown in Figure 5. DE analysis showed
more numbers of DE sRNAs in the microfluidics-based method than Triton-based
method. As expected, we observed that DE sRNAs, which are supposed
to be enriched in the nuclei, e.g., sdRNA and small nuclear RNA (snRNA),
were under expressed in microfluidics-based sc-sRNA-seq as we only
used the cytoplasmic fractions here. Triton-based method also showed
under-expression with some nuclear enriched sRNAs, which may imply
incomplete lysis of nuclear membrane.9 We
also examined the length bias due to the difference in the lysis as
shown in Figure S-9. However, we observed
no clear evidence for length bias.

Figure 5 Scatter plots of sRNA expression comparing
two lysing and extraction methods to 10 pg of K562 prepurified
RNA sample. (A) Plotted are correlation of sRNA expression for Triton
vs 10 pg total RNA for small RNA types (miRNA, tsRNA, sdRNA, lincRNA,
and snRNA). (B) Correlation of sRNA expression of microfluidics-based
approach vs 10 pg total RNA for the same small RNA types. The Triton
samples were better correlated with 10 pg total RNA especially when
comparing nuclear enriched sRNA such as sdRNA and snRNA since the
microfluidics-based approach used only cytoplasmic fraction. Note
that DEG is a database of essential genes.

miRNA Expression Pattern
To benchmark the quantification
of sRNAs with our protocol, we compared the measured expression of
13 miRNAs, known to be expressed in K562 cells, to those measured
by RT-qPCR (Figure 6).26,27 We think this comparison can provide a better
assessment than comparing to Faridani et al.’s data18 for two reasons: First, Faridani et al. used
different cell lines than ours. Second, the sRNA-seq protocols have
a significant bias,28 which makes the comparison
difficult between one protocol and another. Overall, the trend across
the samples was consistent with the bulk 100 ng samples. Further,
it was also consistent with the microfluidics-based RT-qPCR reported
by White et al.26 For example, miR192 families,
miR192-1 and miR-192-2, which were reported as the most abundant miRNA
(about 16 000 copies/cell) among these miRNAs, showed the highest
expression with K562 cells. miR-16 (miR-16-1 and miR-16-2), which
was reported as 804 ± 261 (S.D.) copies/cell in K562 cell,26 was detected in all the single-cell samples.
In contrast, miR-223, which was reported as 513 ± 406 copies/cell,26 was detected in two samples out of n = 3 with Triton-based approach and ten samples out of n = 12 with the microfluidics-based approach despite the similar expression
levels. We partially attribute the difference in the detection of
miR-16 vs miR-223 to the difference in their regulation. miR-16 is
known to be tightly regulated and has a unimodal expression distribution,
whereas miR-223 has large cell-to-cell variation ranging from 10 to
1 000 copies/cell and multimodal distribution.26 However, we also note that limit of detection of our approach
was roughly 10–100 copies/cell, which we hypothesize from the
stochastic detection of miRNA with abundance of about 10 copies/cell,
e.g., miR-181A and miR-196A families.26 We thus hope in the future to improve the limit of detection and
the system’s throughput to analyze large numbers of single
cells and clearly dissect this cell-to-cell variation.

Figure 6 Expression pattern of
miRNAs known to be expressed in K562 cells for the following samples:
(A) single K562 cells prepared with Triton X-100-based lysis, (B)
those prepared with microfluidics-base lysis and extraction, (C) 10
pg of total RNA of K562 cells, and (D) 100 ng of total RNA of K562
cells. miRNA sequences are listed in the order of increasing median
abundance as observed in the 100 ng of total RNA data (see also White
et al.26 for comparison). The 100 ng of
total RNA showed the least variation as expected.

Conclusions
Traditional genetic analyses have relied
on measurements in bulk cell populations. However, these measurements
are the average of events stochastically occurring in thousands or
millions of cells. Hence, there has been increased interest in single-cell
analyses and the development of methods which efficiently allow the
sequencing of small amounts of RNA. However, there remain challenges
associated with the single-cell analysis of sRNA molecules, due to
their very small abundance and difficulties in sample preparation.

In this work, we demonstrated two approaches of lysing single cells
compatible with CleanTag library preparation for sRNA sequencing:
Triton X-100 (overnight-frozen) lysis and electrical lysis using microfluidics.
The latter method used a device which separated the nucleus from the
cytoplasmic content of a single cell by selectively lysing the plasma
membrane of a single cell in a trap via electrical lysis and then
quickly and selectively extracting cytoplasmic nucleic acid contents
with ITP.

The RNA samples were processed using the CleanTag
Small RNA Library Preparation kit that leveraged chemically modified
adapters to disfavor adapter dimer formation, the main obstacle to
the sequencing of very low input samples.19 To our knowledge, the present work is the second publication demonstrating
sequencing of sRNAs from single cells, the first being by Faridani
et al.18 The CleanTag methodology coupled
with the microfluidics-based lyses and extraction have important advantages
over the method described by Faridani et al. The microfluidic device
performs rapid, automated lysing and then conducts fractionation of
cytoplasmic nucleic acids from nucleic acids from cell nucleus. After
dispensing and trapping the cell, the on-chip process takes 2 min
to extract the cytoplasmic RNA content using the device. When comparing
the Triton-based lysis vs the microfluidics-based lysis, the microfluidics-based
lysis uniquely offered a quicker protocol and better correlation with
100 ng of the bulk sample and RT-qPCR results. On the other hand,
the Triton-based lysis offered more efficient production of on-target
reads and an easier workflow using standard equipment for lysis. The
CleanTag methodology is considerably streamlined, with library preparation
accomplished in 6 h. Despite a relatively small number of samples
analyzed, we were able to sequence sRNAs from single-cell samples.
Our results were slightly improved regarding the sequencing quality
when compared to those of Faridani et al.; however, we hypothesize
there is significant room for improvement regarding the quality of
the reads and the information that can be obtained from single-cell
small RNA sequencing data.

Lastly, in this paper we have striven
to benchmark the sensitivity and repeatability of the proposed protocols
as well as compare the sRNA-seq results to (albeit very limited) published
work, to shed light on what may be biological signal over the noise.
The results suggest that sc-sRNA-seq is possible and provides reproducible
results which at least in part capture cell-to-cell heterogeneity.
