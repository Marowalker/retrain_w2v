Combining data from multiple analytical platforms is
essential
for comprehensive study of the molecular phenotype (metabotype) of
a given biological sample. The metabolite profiles generated are intrinsically
dependent on the analytical platforms, each requiring optimization
of instrumental parameters, separation conditions, and sample extraction
to deliver maximal biological information. An in-depth evaluation
of extraction protocols for characterizing the metabolome of the hepatobiliary
fluke Fasciola hepatica, using ultra
performance liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis coupled
with mass spectroscopy is presented. The spectrometric methods were
characterized by performance, and metrics of merit were established,
including precision, mass accuracy, selectivity, sensitivity, and
platform stability. Although a core group of molecules was common
to all methods, each platform contributed a unique set, whereby 142
metabolites out of 14,724 features were identified. A mixture design
revealed that the chloroform:methanol:water proportion of 15:59:26
was globally the best composition for metabolite extraction across
UPLC-MS and CE-MS platforms accommodating different columns and ionization
modes. Despite the general assumption of the necessity of platform-adapted
protocols for achieving effective metabotype characterization, we
show that an appropriately designed single extraction procedure is
able to fit the requirements of all technologies. This may constitute
a paradigm shift in developing efficient protocols for high-throughput
metabolite profiling with more-general analytical applicability.

==== Body
Metabolic profiling using mass
spectrometry (MS) coupled with ultra performance liquid chromatography
(UPLC) or gas chromatography (GC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy have been successfully applied to the characterization
of systemic responses of organisms to disease, pharmaceutical intervention,
and dietary modulation.1−3 In such studies, the adequacy of a given analytical
platform is typically dependent upon the class of chemical compounds
under investigation, the cost of analysis, the ease of sample preparation,
and the requirement for sensitivity, specificity, and robustness.
No single method enables complete coverage of the entire metabolic
information and, increasingly, metabolic profiling studies are adopting
more than one analytical platform to augment the number of metabolites
identified and thereby enhance the extraction of biological information.

Although the literature is scattered with platform-specific sample
preparation procedures,4 there is a paucity
of studies reporting the systematic evaluation of sample preparation
across multiple platforms.5 Despite the
recent technological developments in the field of sample preparation
of biofluids, spanning from the more-traditional protein precipitation
methods,6−9 liquid–liquid or solid-phase extractions10,11 and microextractions12 to the more-sophisticated
use of molecularly imprinted polymers13 and restricted-access materials,14 sample
extraction continues to be a crucial and time-consuming step of any
analytical method, with important implications on the information
recovered and analytical interpretation. This is particularly true
for comprehensive metabolic profiling, where the chemical complexity,
sample heterogeneity, and wide concentration range of endogenous metabolites
place a strong demand on the extraction procedure.15 Metabolite losses, matrix effects, artifacts, and analytical
variability are often inevitable,16 which
indicate that the ultimate goal of full characterization of a metabolome
will be a challenging task for many biological samples.

To preserve
sample integrity, methods with minimal sample treatment
are desirable and often applicable for liquid biological samples,
such as urine or plasma, where simple dilution followed by filtration
and/or centrifugation are the norm. However, for solid or semisolid
biological samples, such as faeces and tissues, more-elaborate sample
preparation procedures are required. Tissue extraction is usually
performed by the cooled homogenization of tissue, followed by the
stepwise addition of reagents and solvents of differing polarities
such as perchloric acid or methanol–chloroform mixtures.17 Other experimental approaches include the use
of automated homogenizers,18−20 microdialysis tissue sampling,21 and solid-phase extraction with a large variety
of sorbents.22

Here, we apply a multiplatform
strategy for a more-comprehensive
assessment of the metabolic composition of tissues using the parasitic
hepatobiliary trematode Fasciola hepatica as a model system. F. hepatica infects
livestock and imposes a considerable economic burden across the globe
linked to decreased productivity of the affected animals.23 Because of its zoonotic character, fascioliasis
has emerged as human infection in the last two decades, whereby an
estimated 91 million people are at risk. Although some host spots
of prevalence have been identified, such as western Europe, the Andes,
and Egypt, human cases have been reported from as many as 51 countries.24 Disease management is currently suboptimal since
diagnosis is largely based on microscopic examination of helminth
eggs in stools, whereby detection capacity is limited in early and
light infection. The first-line therapeutic intervention is limited
to one main compound, namely triclabendazole, whereby resistances
have already been reported.25 Metabolic
characterization of the fluke may aid in deepening the understanding
of the biochemical communication between parasite and host and may
provide leads for identifying novel diagnostic markers and drug targets
at the metabolic level.

We evaluated the extraction of metabolic
information from spectral
profiles acquired across five different analytical methods. A quadrupole
time-of-flight (Q-ToF) mass analyzer was used for UPLC-MS analysis
in combination with two different column chemistries, i.e. reversed-phase
liquid chromatography (RPLC) using a C18 column and hydrophilic interaction
liquid chromatography (HILIC), in both positive and negative electrospray
ionization modes (ESI+ and ESI–, respectively). Capillary electrophoresis
coupled with mass spectroscopy (CE-MS) was applied in ESI+ mode only.
A mixture design was used to define the optimal solvent composition
for the global platform combination, and thus derive a single procedure
that can be applied generically for tissue extraction across a range
of biomedical samples and analytical platforms. In addition to providing
an optimized and augmented metabolic screening capacity, such an approach
would also facilitate the mathematical modeling across different analytical
platforms, since the preparation parameters are maintained regardless
of platform, thereby reducing additional sources of variation introduced
by differential extraction efficiency of metabolites.26

Materials and Methods
Materials
Water, acetonitrile, methanol, and chloroform
(chromatography-grade) used in the tissue extractions were obtained
from Sigma (Gillingham, U.K.), as well as most of the standards used
to confirm the identity of the chromatographic peaks. Cholic acid
derivatives were acquired from Steraloids, Inc. (Newport, RI, USA)
and phospholipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster,
AL, USA) (see Table S-1 in the Supporting Information). Stock standard solutions were prepared at 1 mg/mL in chromatography-purity
water. Working solutions used in the identification and MS/MS fragmentation
studies were prepared at concentrations of 0.010–0.050 mg/mL.

Sample Preparation
Fresh cattle livers were obtained
from an abattoir in Basel, Switzerland, and live F.
hepatica worms were recovered from the bile ducts
at the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Basel, Switzerland).
Worms were snap frozen and forwarded on dry ice to Imperial College
London and kept at −40 °C.

For characterization
of the F. hepatica metabolome and for
assessment of the methods performance, two batches of six individual
flukes (∼80 mg each) obtained from two different livers were
thawed and weighed. Each worm was placed into a separate 2 mL plastic
tube containing 500 mg of 1 mm-diameter zirconia beads (Stratech Scientific,
Ltd., U.K.). One milliliter (1 mL) of 80% methanol, which was previously
cooled to 4 °C, was added to each tube. The tubes were processed
in a tissue homogenizer (Precellys 24, Peqlab, Ltd., U.K.) in two
30 s cycles of 6,000 rpm and subsequently centrifuged for 5 min
at 18,894 g. The supernatants were transferred
into Eppendorf tubes that were placed on ice. The extraction procedure
was repeated once by adding 500 μL of cold methanol to the remaining
pellet in each tube, followed by homogenization and centrifugation
as described above. Both supernatants were combined and divided in
different aliquots for spectral assessment (i.e., equal aliquots of
100 μL for UPLC-MS and CE-MS analysis), and the remainder was
retained as a backup. The extracts were dried overnight in a speedvac
(Eppendorf concentrator plus, Eppendorf UK, Ltd., Cambridge, U.K.)
at 45 °C, under vacuum and a rotational speed of 1,400 rpm
(the g-force varies according to the position of
the tubes in the rotors between 130 g and 250 g). Dried extracts were stored at −40 °C prior
to UPLC-MS and CE-MS analysis.

In order to evaluate the optimal
solvent extraction condition to
suit multiple analytical platforms, a mixture design study was performed.
A total of 13 F. hepatica worms (∼400
mg total) were ground together in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and
pestle. Samples of the ground tissue (∼30 mg) were transferred
into separate Eppendorf tubes and 1 mL of a given proportion of cooled
solvent/solution (4 °C) was added to the tissue as follows: (1)
= 1,000A, (2) = 1,000B, (3) = 100B + 900C, (4) = 500A + 500B, (5)
= 500A + 500C, (6) = 500B + 500C, (7) = 750A + 250B, (8) = 250A +
750B, (9) = 250B + 750C, (10) = 700A + 150B + 150C, (11) = 150A +
700B + 150C, (12) = 150A + 150B + 700C, and (13) = 333A + 333B + 333C
(where A = 80% methanol, B = 20% methanol, and C = pure chloroform).
Samples were vortexed for 1 min and centrifuged (18,894 g; 5 min), and the upper aqueous phases were transferred into new
separate Eppendorf tubes. The same amount of the solvent mixture was
added to the remaining pelleted biomass and the extraction procedure
was repeated. The aqueous phase was again harvested and combined with
the previous extract into a single Eppendorf tube. Final volumes were
2 mL after the addition of 80% methanol. The samples were vortexed
again and divided into equal aliquots of 200 μL each for UPLC-MS,
CE-MS analysis and a backup sample. The aqueous extracts were dried
overnight at 45 °C under vacuum. The organic phase was collected
and stored at −40 °C but was not analyzed further here,
since the aqueous phase gave information related to both the low-molecular-weight
components and lipids.

The dried aliquots for UPLC-MS and CE-MS
were dissolved in 200
μL of 50% methanol and 20% methanol, respectively, vortexed
for 20 s, and subsequently sonicated for 5 min. A volume of 120 μL
was transferred either into the wells of a 96-well plate (Waters,
Hertfordshire, U.K.) for UPLC-MS or to the CE-MS sample vials (Agilent
Technologies UK, Ltd., Edinburgh, U.K.). A quality control (QC) sample
pool was prepared by mixing 5 μL of each aqueous extract sample
in a separate Eppendorf tube. At the beginning of each of the chromatographic/electrophoretic
runs, five injections from the QC sample pool were made; further QC
injections were made after every five samples throughout the run,
in order to assess repeatability and platform stability.

Instrumentation and Data Acquisition
All extracts were
analyzed on a UPLC system (UPLC Acquity, Waters Ltd., Elstree, U.K.)
coupled online via electrospray ionization to a Q-ToF Premier mass
spectrometer (Waters MS Technologies, Ltd., Manchester, U.K.), using
both a Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (1.8 μm, 2.1 ×
100 mm) at 50 °C and a Waters Acquity HILIC BEH column (1.7 μm,
2.1 × 100 mm) at 40 °C, operated under gradient elution,
as follows. For C18: A = 0.1% formic acid in water, B = 0.1% formic
acid in methanol, under a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. Gradient elution:
0–2 min, 99.9% A:0.10% B; 6 min, 75% A:25% B; 10 min, 20% A:80%
B, 12 min, 10% A:90% B, 21–23 min, 0.10% A:99.9% B, 24–26
min: 99.9% A:0.10% B. For HILIC: A = 95% acetonitrile: 5% 200 mmol/L
ammonium acetate, containing a total of 0.1% formic acid; B = 50%
acetonitrile:50% 20 mmol/L ammonium acetate, containing a total of
0.1% formic acid, under a flow rate of 1.4 mL/min. Strong wash solvent
was 5% acetonitrile, whereas the weak wash solvent was 95% acetonitrile.
Gradient elution: 0–1 min, 99% A:1% B; 12 min, 100% B; 12.1–15
min, 99% A:1% B.

Other chromatographic conditions common to
both modes include the temperature of the autosampler compartment
(4 °C), the injection volume (5 μL), and the injection
loop option (partial loop with needle overfill). Capillary voltage
was 3,200 V (positive ionization) and 2,400 V (negative ionization),
and the sample cone voltage was maintained at 35 V. The desolvation
temperature was set to 350 °C and the source temperature was
set to 120 °C; the cone gas flow and desolvation gas flow were
maintained at 25 and 900 L/h, respectively. The Q-ToF Premier was
operated in V optics mode, with a data acquisition rate of 0.2 s and
a 0.01 s interscan delay. Leucine enkephalin (m/z 556.2771) was used as lockmass, whereby a solution of
200 pg/μL in 50% acetonitrile was infused into the instrument
at a rate of 3 μL/min via an auxiliary sprayer. Data were collected
in centroid mode with a scan range of 50–1000 m/z, with lockmass scans collected every 15 s and
averaged over three scans to perform mass correction.

CE-MS
analysis was performed on an Agilent 7100 capillary electrophoresis
system coupled to an Agilent 6224 Accurate-Mass time-of-flight mass
spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) by means of
a coaxial spray needle configured to an electrospray ionization source.
A fused-silica capillary (Composite Metal Services, Hallow, U.K.)
with an internal diameter of 50 μm, an outer diameter of 375
μm, and a total length of 65 cm was used as a separation device
for the positive ionization mode. New fused-silica capillaries were
conditioned for 30 min with 1 mol/L NaOH at a pressure of 1 bar, followed
by 10 min with deionized water and 30 min with a background electrolyte
(BGE) composed of 0.80 mol/L formic acid at pH 1.8 containing 20%
methanol. Before analysis, the capillary was conditioned by pressure
flushes (925 bar) of 1 mol/L NaOH (10 min), 0.10 mol/L NaOH (10 min),
deionized water (10 min), and BGE (30 min) at 25 °C. In
both cases, the capillary was conditioned with the distal end outside
of the MS source. Between runs, the BGE vials were replenished to
a height of 1.5 cm and the capillary was flushed with BGE for 5 min.
At the end of the day, the capillary was pressure-flushed with deionized
water (10 min), methanol (10 min), and air (10 min). Samples were
injected hydrodynamically (50 mbar for 10 s), followed by injection
of BGE (50 mbar, 5 s). The CE system was operated under a constant
voltage of +30 kV, and the cartridge was thermostatized at 25 °C.
A sheath liquid (SHL) composed of 70% methanol containing
0.5% formic acid was delivered at a flow rate of 4 μL/min
via a 1:100 splitter connected to an isocratic pump (1260 Infinity
Series, Agilent Technologies) running at 400 μL/min. The
nebullizer was set to 10 psig at 0.5 min after injection and a flow
of heated dry nitrogen gas (150 °C) was maintained at a rate
of 10 L/min. Transfer capillary voltage was 4500 V, the fragmentor
was set to 120 V, the skimmer was set to 65 V, and the ion guide octapole
was set to 750 V. The CE unit was operated by the 3D-CE ChemStation
Rev B.04.03 software, and MS data were acquired by the MassHunter
WorkStation Acquisition B.02.01 in centroid mode with a data acquisition
rate of 5 spectra per second. Purine (C5H4N4; [M+H]+ 121.05087) and HP921 (hexakis (2,2,3,3,-tetrafluoropropoxy)
phosphazine; CAS No.: 58943-98-9; C18H18O6N3P3F24; [M+H]+ 922.00980) were used as reference masses, whereby a solution containing
10 mL water, 90 mL methanol, 100 μL formic acid, 1,600 μL
of 5 mmol/L purine, and 600 μL of 2.5 mmol/L phosphazine derivative
listed above (HP 0921) were infused directly into the ion source.
The reference mass spectra were collected simultaneously with the
analytical data and used for accurate mass correction.

Data Processing and Peak Identification
The raw data
files derived from UPLC-MS and CE-MS acquisition were preprocessed,
using the publically available XCMS software (version 1.24.1).27 Isotope peaks, fragments, and adducts were treated
as separate features. For the dataset containing the extracts from
individual flukes, the samples were grouped according to the liver
from which they were extracted, whereby QC samples were treated as
a separate group. Default settings were employed in XCMS, with the
exception of the width of overlapping m/z slices used for creating peak density chromatograms and grouping
peaks across samples (mzwid = 0.025), the bandwidth for the grouping
performed after retention time correction (bw = 10 s), and the degree
of smoothing for local polynomial regression fitting (span = 0.3).
A table of time-aligned detected features containing the retention
times, m/z ratio, and intensities
of each sample was then obtained. Median normalization was performed
using an in-house-developed R script (Dr. K. Veselkov, Imperial College
London),28 followed by tissue weight normalization.
Output tables containing information on the average retention time
and average m/z were also prepared
as data input of an in-house-developed MATLAB script (Dr. P. Masson,
Imperial College London) that allowed searching of candidate metabolites
in an in-house-built UPLC-MS database within specified errors; in
this work, initial values of 0.05 Da for m/z and 1 min for retention time were used. A set of candidate
compounds was then generated as a first pass and errors on the m/z and retention time assignments were
provided for each compound. Compounds with m/z and retention time differing by more than 20 ppm and 0.5
min, respectively, were disregarded. Eventually, a mass chromatogram
of the corresponding authentic standard and the sample were acquired
and the peak submitted to fragmentation in a MS/MS experiment. If
the fragmentation pattern of both standard and sample peak matched,
the peak was then assigned to the alleged compound with improved reliability.

Results and Discussion
Analytical Platform Selectivity for F. hepatica Metabolites
Mass spectroscopy (MS) has the necessary sensitivity
to assess low-abundance molecular species in biological matrices.
When combined with appropriately designed extraction methods and any
gas- or liquid-based separation technique, MS is capable of analyzing
a plethora of metabolites of different chemical classes. Moreover,
the variety of separation modes, ionization schemes, and mass analyzers
qualifies the use of coupled MS platforms as a resourceful approach
to metabolic profiling.29−32

We compared individual F. hepatica extracts at 80% methanol prepared from flukes obtained from two
different cow livers, using analytical conditions and instrumental
parameters provided in previous work for UPLC-MS,18,33 and a method developed specifically for CE-MS.

Typical base
peak mass chromatograms acquired using ESI+ and ESI–,
respectively, on the C18 column are depicted in Figure 1A and Figure S-1A in the Supporting Information. As expected, many polar components exhibited poor retention, coeluting
close to the column dead volume. Therefore, assignments for peaks
eluting by less than 0.94 min (k < 1.0) were not
considered to be reliable. In the positive ionization C18 mass chromatogram
of Figure 1A, a few amino acids exhibited moderate
retention (retention factors (k) in the range of
1.0–6.0): tyrosine, isoleucine/leucine, phenylalanine, and
tryptophan. The mass chromatogram presented retention time windows
for other interesting chemical classes: the elution of cholic acid
derivatives centered roughly at 11 min (k ≈
14), the monosubstituted glycerophosphocholine derivatives eluting
at 12–15 min (k ≈ 17), and the disubstituted
phosphatidylcholine homologues eluting after 17 min (k > 22). A polyethylene glycol peak envelope (∼8 min) was
observed
in the mass chromatogram, but it was also detected in the pure water
and therefore attributed to contamination.

Figure 1 Typical mass chromatograms
and electropherograms of 80% methanol
extracts of F. hepatica flukes acquired
at ESI+ mode in (A) C18 column, (B) HILIC column, and (C) CE capillary.
Key: GPC, glycerophosphocholine; the remaining terms have the nomenclature
α-phosphatidylcholine (L)_n (which represents
a mixture of α-phosphatidylcholines (L)_n numbered
1 to 23 by order of elution in the RPLC-MS method (refs (18) and (33)); tentative identification
based on m/z searches at http://www.lipidmaps.org/data/structure/LMSDSearch.php): L19, 1-hexadecanoyl-2-octadecadienoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine;
L20, 1-nonanoyl-2-tricosanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; L21, 1-hexadecanoyl-2-octadecenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine;
and L23, 1-octadecanoyl-2-octadecenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine.

Similar features were observed in the negative
ionization C18 mass
chromatogram of Figure S-1A in the Supporting
Information. In addition to phenylalanine and tryptophan, a
few carboxylic acids (methylmalonic and pantothenic acids), adenosine
monophosphate (AMP), and inosine comprise the early eluting polar
compounds, whereas, in the cholic acid region, deoxycholic acid was
further detected. Similar compounds were identified in the phospholipid
region for both positive and negative ionization modes, although the
monosubstituted glycerophosphocholine derivatives exhibited much higher
ionization yields in negative ion mode, when compared to the disubstituted
phosphatidylcholine homologues, in direct contrast to the observation
made from the positive ionization mode data.

As the results
of Figure 1A and Figure
S-1A in the Supporting Information testify,
the choice of C18 columns for UPLC-MS studies allows immediate visualization
of nonpolar and moderately polar compounds. However, its use discriminates
instantly against highly polar compounds. Recently, HILIC has been
offered as a powerful alternative to compensate for the poor RPLC
retention of highly polar compounds, ubiquitous components of many
biological fluids.34−36 HILIC is a form of normal-phase liquid chromatography
(NPLC) in the sense that uses polar stationary phases, usually water-rich
layers immobilized onto silica particles. However, unlike NPLC, HILIC
employs aqueous mobile phases; during gradient elution, the polarity
is increased from a low organic content to a high-water-content mobile
phase in order to promote the elution of polar compounds. HILIC columns
have found application in numerous areas, including metabolic profiling
of various pathologies, but as yet a systematic evaluation of their
performance as a metabolic profiling tool is lacking.37,38

Typical base peak mass chromatograms are shown in Figure 1B and Figure S-1B in the Supporting
Information, acquired under positive and negative ionization
modes, respectively, on the HILIC column. In the positive ionization
mode (Figure 1B), prominent peaks from a few
quaternary ammonium compounds (choline and betaine) and proline (a
cyclic aminoacid) were bracketed by moderately retained phospholipids
(4 < k < 5) and α-phosphatidylcholine-dipalmitoyl
(k = 9). The negative ionization mode mass chromatogram
(Figure S-1B in the Supporting Information) was richer, in terms of polar compounds: succinic acid and AMP
constitute the acidic components, whereas tryptophan, phenylalanine,
taurine, glutamine, glutamic acid, and histidine constitute the amino
acids components. Proline and betaine were also identified in the
mass chromatogram. Similar to the observation from the C18 column,
in negative ionization mode, a fraction of single substituted glycerophosphatidylcholine
homologues emerged.

Although we expected to visualize a much
larger variety of polar
compounds with the HILIC column, that was not the case for the tissue
samples under investigation. This might be due to the fact that these
samples were prepared in high concentrations of methanol, resulting
in a preferential extraction of phospholipids, which outnumbered the
polar components. Since the phospholipids exhibited an extensive retention
in chromatography, even in HILIC columns, the information on polar
compounds was somewhat compromised.

Considering the orthogonal
separation mechanism provided by CE
when compared to LC, CE has emerged as a promising complementary technique
for metabolic profiling.39−41 Small cationic and anionic charged
species are expected to be the target metabolites of CE separations.
CE-MS metabolic profiling studies are often conducted under electrospray
ionization (ESI) and triple coaxial sheath flow interfaces. Unlike
UPLC, the mobile phase or, more precisely, the background electrolyte
(BGE) composition changes according to the selected ionization mode.
Typically, cationic metabolites are screened in low-pH volatile electrolytes,
such as formic acid or acetic acid, whereas anionic metabolites are
analyzed in high-pH volatile electrolytes, such as ammonia/ammonium
salts buffers (ammonium formate, acetate, or carbonate being the most
commonly used). The addition of low percentages of organic solvents
to the BGE is often required to improve resolution. In addition, a
SHL that may be of distinct composition for each ionization mode is
also used to promote ionization at the capillary tip.

A typical
extracted-compound mass electropherogram acquired under
positive ionization mode is shown in Figure 1C. The BGE and SHL composition, as well as instrumental parameters,
were previously optimized with mixtures of appropriate standards to
provide the highest signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio and best resolution.
Peak assignment relied on comparisons of migration times and m/z with an in-house-built database composed
of ca. 120 authentic standards, mostly amino acids and substituted
amines.

In order to evaluate comparatively the metabolic coverage
of each
analytical method applied to F. hepatica tissue samples, selected statistics were compiled in Table 1. Peaks per sample refers to the number of peaks
XCMS delivered after its peak picking algorithm was performed; metabolite
features is the number of peak groups after grouping, alignment, and
normalization took place, indicating that the parameters chosen in
these routines adequately extracted compounds within specified m/z and time slices across all samples.27

As observed in Table 1, a total
of 14,724
metabolite features were extracted, of which 385 metabolites were
tentatively identified, based on in-house databases, comparison with
authentic standards, and occasionally MS/MS fragmentation. After eliminating
the redundant assignments among methods, 142 unique metabolites resulted.
A complete list of assigned metabolites is provided in the Supporting Information (Table S-2). As the data
in Table 1 indicates, although the overall
number of features is quite large, it does not necessarily translate
into information or biomarkers. The tissue samples under examination
were quite rich in phospholipids, derivatives, and homologues, which
were compounds predominantly visualized by four UPLC-MS out of five
protocols. In addition, the fact that no filtering algorithms were
applied also contributed to increasing the number of retrieved features.
We chose not to use filtering algorithms, because the raw data are
the most useful at a general level. For identification purposes, for
instance, the related m/z due to
isotope patterns, fragments, salt adducts, etc. ultimately improved
our ability to identify metabolites. The relative low yield of metabolic
features obtained via CE-MS, compared to the UPLC-MS-based methods,
is likely to be due to inappropriate original sample dilution and
further dilution of the sample within the electrospray interface by
the SHL. The initial number of peaks per sample is already low for
CE-MS (Table 1). Furthermore, phospholipids,
which are the richest components of the tissue samples under consideration,
were not taken into account in the CE-MS method. Online signal enhancement
strategies have been invoked to address sensitivity issues of CE-MS
metabolic profiling studies;42 nevertheless,
the number of retrieved features when a SHL is employed is usually
poor, varying from a few hundreds to ∼1000.8,41,43,44

Identification
of metabolites for UPLC-MS platforms relied solely
on in-house databases, which explains the relatively small number
of identified metabolites per feature (<2% for RPLC-MS and 6% for
HILIC-MS, versus 32% for CE-MS). Each database contains a few hundred
metabolites, classified by retention/migration time and m/z, and were built using information gathered from
different biological samples (serum, urine, tissue, etc) fortified
by authentic standards. In a way, these libraries also account for
matrix effects and their use was preferred over the use of publicly
available databases, because peak assignment could be performed with
increased reliability.

Interestingly, Table 1 shows that, for the
RPLC-MS method, practically half of the identified compounds were
not properly retained by the C18 column, and, among the retained compounds,
39% were small polar metabolites for ESI+ and 63% for ESI–.
With the HILIC column, a similar large number of metabolites were
extracted in both ionization modes, despite the low complexity of
the corresponding mass chromatogram (Figure 1B); practically all identified compounds were retained, and, among
them, 63%–67% were small polar compounds. As expected, CE-MS
had the best yield of polar compounds over the identified metabolites
(100%).

The Venn diagram in Figure 2 summarizes
the selectivity differences among the five analytical methods applied.
Metabolite identification was not exhaustive but rather dependent
on the variety and quantity of compounds contemplated in our libraries.
Nine (9) out of 142 metabolites were identified across all analytical
platforms but many metabolites are unique to a given method, denoting
complementarity over redundancy of the proposed multiplatform approach.
HILIC-MS provided the largest number of unique metabolites in both
ionization modes.

across all
analytical platforms. The metabolites are color-coded according to
the method by which they were identified: red (five methods), brown
(four methods), green (three methods), blue (two methods) and black
(one method). Common metabolites to all five methods: (71) glutathione,
(81) hypoxanthine, (83) inosine, (84) isoleucine, (85) leucine, (90)
methionine, (104) phenylalanine, (130) tryptophan, and (132) tyrosine.

Evaluation of Systems Performance
Performance characteristic
data for selected components found in 12 individual F. hepatica extracts prepared at 80% methanol with
flukes obtained from two different liver sources have been compiled
in Table 2 and include retention/migration
times and peak area precision, as well as mass accuracy, signal-to-noise
(S/N) ratios, plate numbers per meter (N/m), retention factor (k) and effective mobility (μeff) in Tiselius
units (TU). For both UPLC and CE, peak areas were normalized by the
corresponding worm weight. Each peak area in the CE mass electropherogram
was further corrected by the migration time, since peaks migrate at
different velocities past the detector.

b Peak areas were further corrected

c Root-mean-square
(rms) noise.

Peak area ratios of selected compounds in the extracts
prepared
from worms obtained from livers 1 and 2 did not differ much for the
UPLC-MS data (C18 and HILIC columns, both ESI+ and ESI−). Retention
time repeatability was found to be remarkably high for both C18 and
HILIC columns in ESI+ (an average of 0.2% CV) but relatively lower
in ESI– (ca. 0.9% CV). CE-MS data presented a much higher CV
in migration time when compared to UPLC-MS (average of 2% CV), whereas
the precisions for peak area with liver 1 fluke preparations were
similar. Samples prepared from liver 2 provided much lower counts
for peak area (not shown) and a large within-sample variability (average
of 58% CV). In CE-MS, apparent migration times are prone to error,
because of electro-osmotic flow (eof) variability (surface phenomenon
and instrumental variation, such as the SHL and gas flow rates at
the interface). Although we found that the precision of the migration
time is within acceptable values for CE-MS, precision could be improved
using several strategies, including normalization to internal standards,45 and the use of dynamically coated capillaries.46 The use of internal standards helps to correct
migration time misalignments and it will also improve the efficiency
of peak grouping algorithms augmenting the number of retrieved features.
However, the migration time variation that we observed in Table 2 was not detrimental to the overall quality of the
data processing and classification. By reporting electrophoretic mobilities
(after eof correction) instead of migration times, precision can be
improved to the level of UPLC-MS. Since the eof value was not measured
in each single run, mobility precision could not be estimated; however,
an estimate of the effective mobility order of magnitude for selected
solutes was included in Table 2, as well as
the retention factors for UPLC-MS data. Other features of Table 2 include the following:• Mass accuracy was better than
5 ppm, with a few exceptions;

• S/N ratios were roughly 10–20
fold smaller for CE-MS data when compared to UPLC-MS data, reinforcing
the idea of dilution of sample components at the interface by the
sheath liquid; and

• Plate numbers, overall, were
larger for phospholipids than for polar compounds in the C18 column,
but equivalent high values were obtained in the HILIC column at both
ionization modes, even surpassing the efficiency obtained by CE-MS
when polar compounds were contrasted.



Principal component analysis (PCA) of the QC samples
for each analytical
platform showed that all QC samples clustered together, except for
the first 3–5 injections, which were used for system stabilization
and, therefore, were expected to present some scattering. Moreover,
it was observed that 64% of the total number of metabolite features
presented a CV value of <30%, which denotes a reliable dataset.47

Mixture Designed Extractions
A number of experimental
designs have been developed to address specifically the analysis and
modeling of mixtures.48,49 One common manner in which mixture
proportions for three mixture components can be summarized is via
triangular graphs. Figure 3 and Figures S-2, S-3A, S-3B, and S-4 in the Supporting Information depict a series of mass chromatograms or electropherograms registered
for the aqueous phase of mixture designed extracts of a pooled F. hepatica tissue sample. The line between (a) and
(b) in Figure 3 (apexes of the triangle inserts)
corresponds to binary solvent mixtures containing methanol:water in
different proportions, ranging from 80% methanol (a) to 20% methanol
(b); all other points in the triangle are ternary mixtures, i.e.,
they contain methanol:water:chloroform as extracting solvents. Since
the organic layer was discarded, and only the aqueous layer retained
for analysis, all extraction solvents considered in this study must
contain a certain amount of water. Thus point (c) is not an apex,
but does contain a large amount of chloroform to explore its extraction
ability, with respect to more hydrophobic compounds (c is 90:10, where
90 parts correspond to pure chloroform and 10 parts correspond to
a 20% methanol solution in water).

Figure 3 Optimization of extraction of a pooled F. hepatica sample using a mixture design approach
and RPLC-MS analysis in ESI+
mode. Analyses were performed only on the aqueous extracts. Extractions
were performed in (a) 80% methanol, (b) 20% methanol, (c) 90:10 chloroform:20%
methanol, (d) 65% methanol, and (e) 15:15:70 chloroform:20% methanol:80%
methanol.

Although points (d) and (e) in Figure 3 contain
a similar amount of methanol in the aqueous phase (65% for (d) and
69% for (e)), the extraction power of solvents (d) and (e) toward
the tissue sample components differs greatly. Solvent (e) is a ternary
mixture, i.e., contains chloroform, and therefore a partition equilibrium
takes place. The tissue components will distribute between the organic
and aqueous phase according to their characteristics and intermolecular
interactions will modulate the partition.

In Figure 3, all chromatograms are fairly
similar in composition, except for the region comprising 17–21
min. That particular region corresponds to the retention of the more
hydrophobic tissue components, i.e., glycerophosphocholine derivatives
and homologues. For binary mixtures (line a-d-b), it is clear that
a large amount of methanol is necessary to maintain these compounds
solubilized in the aqueous phase. For ternary mixtures in the line
c-b, the amount of chloroform does not seem to make any impact in
the extract composition. Extracts (b) and (c) are quite similar, despite
the large amount of chloroform in (c) (90 parts); low amounts of methanol
in the aqueous phase, 20% in this case, were not enough to solubilize
the phospholipids. However, the situation is strikingly different
if larger amounts of methanol are used in the presence of chloroform.
If the chromatograms of the tissues extracted by solvents (d) and
(e) are inspected (65% methanol, no chloroform for (d); 69% methanol
in aqueous phase, 15 parts of chloroform for (e)), a collection of
peaks in the phospholipids retention region is readily visualized.
Possibly in the case of extract (e), the presence of chloroform and
moderate amounts of methanol induce partition of the phospholipids
toward the aqueous phase, whereas in the case of extract (c), the
aqueous phase was too polar and the phospholipids remained in the
chloroform phase.

The HILIC-MS chromatograms corresponding to
mixture designed extracts
of F. hepatica (Figure S-3 in the Supporting Information) repeats the same
features presented by the C18 phase, although the phospholipid fractions
are much less prominent. However, as observed in the mass electropherograms
of Figure S-4 in the Supporting Information, CE-MS appears to be insensitive toward the composition of the extraction
medium, since it discriminates only the most polar fraction of the
analyzed samples.

Application of mixture design methods can
be used to summarize
the performance surface of various solvents toward a selected response
in geometric graphs. So far, Figure 3 has been
generated to explore the data in a qualitative manner, in which the
total number of peaks and S/N enhancement were considered guiding
responses. However, in quantitative approaches, optimal proportions
of a solvent mixture can be sought based on the yield of metabolite
extraction. The contour plot in Figure 4A represents
the corrected peak area of phenylalanine, analyzed by RPLC-MS at ESI+,
as a function of solvent composition used in the extraction. A cubic
model was fitted to the data using the Design-Expert software, showing
significant model terms (F = 12, p-value = 0.004, adjusted r2 = 0.85, PRESS
= 4.08 × 107). It is clear from Figure 4A that lower percentages of methanol as the extraction solvent
enhances the amount of phenylalanine, which is consistent with the
polar character of the compound. Similarly, Figure 4B presents a response surface for the corrected peak area
of α-phosphatidylcholine (L)_23 (1-octadecanoyl-2-octadecenoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine)
analyzed using the same platform, as a function of solvent composition
used during extraction. The concentration of α-phosphatidylcholine
(L)_23 at the ternary point (composition marked as (e) in the chromatogram
of Figure 3) is remarkably high. As a matter
of fact, this point is an outlier of the model and cannot be explained
by the response surface of Figure 4B. If included,
it creates a discontinuity in the model and poor statistical results
(with outlier: F = 4.59, p-value
= 0.039, adjusted r2 = 0.37, PRESS = 5.49
× 109; without outlier: F = 20, p-value = 0.004, adjusted r2 = 0.84, PRESS = 1.44 × 109). Nevertheless, what
can be observed from Figure 4B is that as the
methanol content of the solvent increases, the concentration of α-phosphatidylcholine
(L)_23 increases, which is consistent with the hydrophobic character
of this phospholipid. More importantly, the enrichment of phospholipids
in the tissue extract for this particular ternary point solvent combination
can be rationalized by the physical chemical properties of chloroform.
Chloroform is an unusual solvent in the sense that it exhibits a low
dielectric constant (on the order of 4.81; for reference, methanol
has a dielectric constant of 32.6 and water has a dielectric constant
of 78.5)50 but, at the same time, it has
a measurable effective hydrogen bond acidity (Abrahańs A parameter on the order of 0.15; for comparison, methanol
has an A value of 0.43 and water has an A value of 0.82).51 Thus, chloroform is
able to interact with the oxygen atoms in both methanol and the phospholipid
molecule via hydrogen bonding. By dissolving into methanol to a certain
extent, chloroform serves as a carrier and brings the phospholipid
into the methanolic phase. Therefore, even for smaller amounts of
methanol, when chloroform is used as part of the extraction medium,
an enrichment of phospholipids in the extract results.

Figure 4 Representation of responses
as a function of extraction composition
for RPLC-MS at ESI+ mode. Responses are computed as the peak area
of (A) phenylalanine and (B) α-phosphatidylcholine (L)_23 (1-octadecanoyl-2-octadecenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine)
corrected by the biomass weight.

Conclusion
The different analytical methods applied,
i.e., UPLC-MS (C18 and
HILIC) in ESI+ and ESI– modes and CE-MS in ESI+ mode, proved
to be highly complementary for gaining maximum metabolite coverage
and, hence, offer a real opportunity for planning future multiplatform
use in global metabolic profiling. Although a core group of molecules
was common to all five methods applied, each chromatographic platform
contributed a unique set of metabolites to the final metabolic yield
of 142 metabolites (or 14,724 features). The mixture design for tissue
extraction, which delivered the best compromise for all five analytical
methods, in terms of number of metabolites retrieved and yield, was
a 15:59:26 chloroform:methanol:water mix.

The use of a single
solvent system and tissue extraction method
for all platforms in any given study reduces the complexity of statistical
integration of the data from the different analytical platforms, since
the variability resulting from differences in extraction efficiency
between platform-optimized solvents or sample extraction methods is
removed. Thus, the power of using statistical correlation between
multiple analytical platforms is enhanced and should result in enhanced
biomarker identification and recovery.

The strategy applied
here for metabolite extraction from F. hepatica samples may be widely applicable to other
helminths or mammalian tissue samples.
