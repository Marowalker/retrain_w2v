The recent outbreak of Zika virus
(ZIKV) infection in the Americas
and its devastating impact on fetal development have prompted the
World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the ZIKV pandemic as a
Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Rapid and reliable
diagnostics for ZIKV are vital because ZIKV-infected individuals display
no symptoms or nonspecific symptoms similar to other viral infections.
Because immunoassays lack adequate sensitivity and selectivity and
are unable to identify active state of infection, molecular diagnostics
are an effective means to detect ZIKV soon after infection and throughout
pregnancy. We report on a highly sensitive reverse-transcription loop-mediated,
isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for rapid detection of ZIKV
and its implementation in a simple, easy-to-use, inexpensive, point-of-care
(POC) disposable cassette that carries out all the unit operations
from sample introduction to detection. For thermal control of the
cassette, we use a chemically heated cup without a need for electrical
power. Amplification products are detected with leuco crystal violet
(LCV) dye by eye without a need for instrumentation. We demonstrated
the utility of our POC diagnostic system by detecting ZIKV in oral
samples with sensitivity of 5 plaque-forming units (PFU) in less than
40 min. Our system is particularly suitable for resource-poor settings,
where centralized laboratory facilities, funds, and trained personnel
are in short supply, and for use in doctors’ offices, clinics,
and at home.

==== Body
Zika virus
(ZIKV) is an Aedes mosquito-borne flavivirus that
emerged in Brazil in
2015 and has rapidly spread throughout tropical and subtropical Americas.1−4 In addition to transmission via infected mosquito bite, the virus
can be transmitted from an infected woman to her unborn baby, through
sexual contact, and via blood transfusion. ZIKV is a major health
concern because it has been linked to Guillain-Barré syndrome
(GBS),5 congenital microcephaly, and other
severe neurological defects in newborns of mothers, who were infected
with ZIKV while pregnant.6−8 Because ZIKV-infected individuals
are asymptomatic or present symptoms common to many other febrile
illnesses,4 rapid and reliable diagnostic
tools for ZIKV are vital. Such tools are also important (i) for risk
management throughout pregnancy; (ii) to track the effects of ZIKV
on fetal development; (iii) to monitor treatment and vaccine efficacy;
(iv) to track the spread of the infection and support control and
eradication efforts; and (v) to ensure the safety of the blood supply.

Although lateral-flow immunochromatographic assays9−11 for ZIKV are rapid, simple, inexpensive, and instrument-free, they
often suffer from low sensitivity and specificity. This is especially
true in the case of ZIKV infection because antibodies to ZIKV cross-react
with other highly homologous flaviviruses (including dengue), which
may lead to nonspecific test results.11 RT-PCR diagnostics for ZIKV is highly specific and sensitive, and
considered the gold standard for ZIKV detection.4,12−14 Conventional PCR amplification requires, however,
extensive sample preparation, sophisticated and expensive equipment,
centralized laboratory facilities, and trained personnel, all of which
are in short supply in resource-poor settings. Point-of-care (POC)
molecular diagnostics may alleviate this bottleneck due to constrained
resources, and improve the quality of health care. Recently, Pardee
et al. have reported a low-cost molecular diagnostic method for the
detection of the Zika virus by combining nucleic-acid-sequence-based
amplification (NASBA) with biosensors.15 However, it has still some limitations for POC diagnostic applications,
such as relatively long detection time (∼3 h), low sensitivity,
and relatively tedious operation steps.

To facilitate inexpensive
enzymatic amplification with minimal
or no instrumentation, we utilized reverse-transcription loop-mediated
amplification (RT-LAMP).16,17 We examined bioinformatic
data to identify highly conserved regions of the ZIKV genome and designed
six specific primers for the Zika lineage that is prevalent in the
Americas. To enable POC molecular diagnostics, we used a custom-made
disposable microfluidic cassette17 that
combines viral nucleic acid capture, concentration, and purification;
isothermal amplification; and detection. For isothermal amplification,
our cassette is combined with a custom-made electricity-free cup that
generates heat with an exothermic reaction and regulates temperature
with a phase change material.18 To eliminate
the need for fluorescence excitation and detection, we employed a
colorless leuco crystal violet (LCV) that undergoes a color change
to violet in the presence of amplicon dsDNA.19

ZIKV can be detected in blood, oral fluid (saliva), urine,
and
semen.20−23 Our method can operate with any of these body fluids. In this paper,
we use, however, oral fluid samples. Recent studies indicate that
ZIKV is more frequently detectable in saliva and at higher concentrations
than in blood.24 Saliva samples were routinely
used during the French Polynesian ZIKV outbreak.24 Saliva is also an attractive sampling medium because it
can be collected noninvasively;25−28 furthermore, sample collection is possible when blood
is difficult to collect, such as from young children and neonates,
in remote places lacking medical facilities, and in community settings
for purposes of surveillance and epidemiology.

Experimental Section
RT-LAMP
Primer Design
To design specific RT-LAMP primers
for the ZIKV strains prevailing in the Americas, we aligned and analyzed
complete genome sequences of isolates from Brazil (15 strains), Mexico
(2 strains), Suriname (1 strain), and Columbia (1 strain) (Table S1
and Figure S1 of Supporting Information (SI)). These sequences were compared with sequences of other flaviviruses
(Figure S1 of SI) using DNAMAN software.29 The envelope protein coding region (Figure S2
of SI) was selected to design ZIKV RT-LAMP
primers due to its high homology among ZIKV isolates and high divergence
from the other flaviviruses examined. The six RT-LAMP primer-set was
designed with the PrimerExplorer V4 software available from Eiken
Chemical Co. Ltd. A BLAST search of the GenBank nucleotide database
was carried out for the selected primers’ sequences to verify
specificity. The RT-LAMP sequences were synthesized by a commercial
vendor (IDT, Coralville, IA) and documented in Table 1 together with the concentrations that we
used in the reaction mixture. Our FIP primer consists of a mixture
of two primers, differing in a single base pair, denoted with the
letter R. This mixture of two FIP primers is used to maintain high
amplification efficiency of the various ZIKV strains prevailing in
the Americas.

Target Virus
Zika virus (mex 2–81) was obtained
from the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses
(WRCEVA, Dr. Robert Tesh, Director)30 and
propagated in the mosquito cell line C6/36 cells. We determined the
viable viral concentration (PFU/mL) with a plaque assay on Vero cells.

Benchtop RT-LAMP Amplification and RT-qPCR
Zika viral
RNA was extracted with Qiagen Viral RNA mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia,
CA), following manufacturer’s recommendations. In addition
to the primers (Table 1) and template, the RT-LAMP reaction mixture (15 μL) included:
9 μL of OptiGene Isothermal Master Mix ISO-100 (OptiGene, U.K.),
2 U of AMV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and 0.5
μL of EvaGreen fluorescent dye (Biotium, Hayward, CA). Amplification
was carried out and monitored with Peltier Thermal Cycler PTC-200
(Bio-Rad DNA Engine, Hercules, CA) at 63 °C. Fluorescence emission
intensity data were collected once every minute for 40 min. For comparison
with standard laboratory procedures, benchtop RT-PCR was carried out
as described in SI.

Saliva Samples Spiked with
ZIKV
To demonstrate our
POC RT-LAMP assay and to test possible interference from agents in
saliva, we collected whole mouth saliva (WMS) from healthy, consenting,
adult volunteers (Figure 1A). Then, the ZIKV was spiked in the saliva at various concentrations.
For safety, the ZIKVs were first inactivated by mixing the medium
laden with ZIKVs with a binding/lysis buffer (AVL buffer) (QIAamp
Viral RNA Mini Kit) in a biosafety facility, followed by addition
of ethanol to the lysate according to the Qiagen protocol.

binding/lysis (AVL) buffer. (B) The lysed sample is filtered through
the isolation membrane of our microfluidic cassette for nucleic acid
extraction. (C) Exploded view of the chemically heated cup. The cup

PCM material, heat sink and single-use Mg–Fe alloy pack heat
source. (D) A photograph of the chemically heated cup for point of
care molecular diagnostics of ZIKV.

ZIKV-Processing on the Microfluidic Cassette
Each disposable
cassette contains four independent, multifunctional, isothermal, amplification
reactors (Figure 1B).
Each reactor features, at its entry port, a flow-through Qiagen porous
silica membrane (QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit) that serves as a solid
binding phase for nucleic acid immobilization.17,31,32

A 65-μL sample, consisting of
ZIKV lysate with various ZIKV concentrations, was filtered through
the isolation membrane of each reactor. The nucleic acids bound to
the silica membrane, and the filtrate was discharged to waste. Subsequent
to sample introduction, 100 μL of Qiagen ethanol-based wash
buffer 1 (AW1) was pipetted through the membrane to remove any amplification
inhibitors. Then, the silica membrane was washed with 200 μL
of Qiagen ethanol-based wash buffer 2 (AW2), followed by air-drying
with a disposable syringe for 30 s.

For colorimetric detection,
a LCV dye containing 0.5 mM crystal
violet (CV), 30 mM sodium sulfate, and 5 mM β-cyclodextrin was
prepared.19 The RT-LAMP reaction was carried
out with a Loopamp RNA amplification kit (Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd.,
Japan). The 25-μL reaction master mixture, consisting of 1.6
μM FIP and BIP, 0.8 μM LF and LB, 0.2 μM F3 and
B3; 1 μL enzyme; and 5.5 μL LCV dye, was injected into
each reaction chamber through the inlet port and the immobilization
membrane. The cassette was then inserted into the chemically heated
cup for isothermal amplification.

Electricity-Free POC Processor
As an inexpensive, optionally
disposable processor, we used a simple, thermally insulated portable
cup heated by an exothermic reaction for chip-based isothermal amplification. Figure 1C,D show, respectively,
a schematic depiction and a photo of the chemically heated cup.18 Briefly, the cup consists of a thermos cup body
(Thermos L.L.C), a microfluidic chip holder, and a 3D printed cup
lid. The thermos cup body can be alternatively made with Styrofoam
for further cost reduction. A pack of Mg–Fe alloy, (Innotech
Products Ltd., U.S.A., costing ∼ $0.15 per charge) served as
the heat source and was placed in a drawer in the cup lid (Figure 1C). Tap water was
introduced into the drawer through a port in the cup lid (Figure 1D) to interact with
the Mg–Fe alloy to produce heat. To isolate the amplification
reactors from variable ambient conditions, we used a phase change
material (PCM) that melts at 68 °C (PureTemp 68, Entropy Solutions
Inc., Plymouth, MN) to regulate the temperature. An aluminum heat
sink embedded in the PCM enhanced heat transfer from the PCM to the
cassette. After the desired incubation time (typically, 40 min), the
detection results were directly observed by eye and/or recorded with
a cell phone.

Results and Discussion
RT-LAMP Assay
RT-PCR is considered the gold standard
for ZIKV detection.24 PCR requires, however,
thermal cycling and considerable operator skills, which in turn require
centralized laboratories, expensive equipment, and highly trained
personnel—all of which are in short supply in resource-poor
settings. To avoid the complications and cost of thermal cycling,
we selected to use isothermal enzymatic amplification method. The
ability to carry out the amplification at a fixed temperature, without
thermal cycling, greatly reduces instrumentation complexity and cost
compared to PCR. We use here RT-LAMP assay for molecular detection
of ZIKV. Because LAMP typically employs a set of six primers that
recognize eight different locations along the target sequence, its
specificity is better than that of PCR, wherein the target is recognized
only at two locations. LAMP is also highly efficient, producing a
very large number of amplicons, which simplifies detection and reduces
processing time compared to PCR. Since we did not find any reports
of RT-LAMP primer designs for ZIKV, we first designed and verified
such primers.

According to a recent report,33 patients infected in Surinam and Brazil in 2015 are closely
related to the strain that circulated in French Polynesia in 2013,
with more than 99.7% and 99.9% of nucleotide and amino acid identity,
respectively. This suggests that well-designed primers will provide
efficient enzymatic amplification for most, if not all, ZIKV strains
in the Americas. We aligned the sequences of 19 ZIKV strains form
the Americas and identified a highly conserved region of 218 nucleotides
(nt) in the envelope protein coding region with 99.74% nucleotide
identity across the known strains of the virus (Figure S2 in SI). This region is also highly divergent from
other common flaviviruses (Figure S1 in SI). With the aid of the PrimerExplorer V4 software (Eiken Chemical
Co. Ltd.), we designed the primer set documented in Table 1. We then used this primer set
to amplify various concentrations of ZIKV RNA.

Figure 2A depicts normalized fluorescence emission intensity
as a function of time during the amplification process of 0 (negative
control), 5, 50, and 500 PFU of ZIKV on the benchtop. The fluorescent
intensity of the negative control (no target) remains nearly level
throughout the entire incubation time, indicating negligible amplicon
formation, if any, of primer-dimers. In the presence of ZIKV, the
emission intensity increased from the baseline to the saturation level
as the incubation time increased. The higher the target concentration,
the earlier the intensity curve increased above the baseline. The
results clearly indicate that 5 PFU of ZIKV can be readily detected.
To quantify the amplification process, we define the threshold time tT. This is the time required
for the amplification curve to reach half its saturation value. Figure 2B depicts the threshold
time tT (min) as a function of the log
of the ZIKV PFU. In the range from 5 PFU to 500 PFU, the threshold
time tT decreases nearly linearly as a
function of log (PFU). The experiment indicates that by monitoring
the threshold time tT, it is possible
to quantify the target. The experimental data was also remarkably
reproducible. The error bars in Figure 2B represent one standard deviation. For comparison,
we also carried out a real-time RT-PCR assay and obtained a similar
detection limit (Table S2 and Figure S3 in SI) to that of our benchtop RT-LAMP.

presence of 500, 50, 5,
and 0 PFU of ZIKV per reaction. (B) The threshold time tT (in minutes) as a function of the PFU (n = 3).

Instrument-Free Point-of-Care
Molecular Diagnostic System
Because the LAMP reaction is
robust and performs efficiently over
a range of temperature (i.e., 60–65 °C), high precision
temperature control is not essential. Our POC molecular diagnostic
system consists of: (i) a disposable microfluidic cassette and (ii)
a chemically heated cup. Our custom-made microfluidic cassette (Figure 1B) consists of four
independent multifunctional amplification reactors. Here, we used
these reactors to amplify saliva samples with various Zika virus concentrations
to demonstrate the utility of our technology platform. In applications,
the reactor array can be used to provide positive and negative controls
and to codetect multiple targets such as ZIKV and dengue viruses.
Each reactor is equipped with a nucleic acid isolation, purification,
and concentration membrane. When the lysed sample is introduced into
the reactor, the nucleic acids bind to the membrane. The membrane
allows us to use sample volumes that far exceed the amplification
reactor’s volume, which enables the test to achieve high sensitivity.

To provide the incubation temperature without reliance on electric
power, we use our simple, inexpensive chemically heated cup.18 The commercially available flameless ration
heater (FRH) is our heat source.34 Heat
is produced when the magnesium–iron alloy interacts with water.
To maintain the temperature of the amplification reactors at the desired
value, we use a PCM with a melting temperature of 68 °C. When
the exothermic reaction produces more energy than needed to bring
the PCM to 68 °C, the excess energy is consumed as latent heat
and the PCM remains at its phase transition temperature of 68 °C
as long as two phases (solid and liquid) coexist. Due to thermal resistance,
the amplification chambers’ temperature is about 5 °C
lower than the phase transition temperature. When the ambient temperature
ranges from 12 to 35 °C, a single Mg–Fe packet is sufficient
to maintain the temperature within accepted tolerances for over 1
h18 at the cost of ∼ $0.15 per cassette.
The cup can be reused once the FRH is replaced. Alternatively, the
thermos cup body can be replaced with Styrofoam (∼$ 0.1–0.5
per processor) for single use. Based on what we pay for reagents35 and materials, we estimate the cost of the ZIKV
test at approximately $2.

Zika Virus Detection in Saliva at the Point
of Care
To demonstrate the utility of our system for ZIKV
detection, we spiked
saliva samples with varying concentration of ZIKV. One of the objectives
of this experiment is to verify that substances present in saliva
do not interfere with RT-LAMP. We use colorimetric detection to enable
us to determine test results by eye for instrument-free detection.
To this end, we included LCV dye with the reaction mixture. The colorless
LCV is converted into violet CV in presence of dsDNA.24 Thus, successful amplification is detected by a change
of color.

We carried out our experiments outdoors (at ambient
temperature of 18 °C) with Zika virus spiked in saliva (Figure
S4 in SI). Saliva samples containing 0
(negative control), 5, 50, and 500 PFU of ZIKV were pipetted into
the various reactors in our microfluidic cassette. The cassette was
then inserted into the chemically heated cup, and the exothermic reaction
was triggered by introducing water into the cup. The cassette was
removed from the chemically heated cup after 40 min for visual detection. Figure 3A,B are, respectively,
optical photographs of the cassette before and after RT-LAMP. Prior
to incubation, all reactors are nearly colorless due to the absence
of dsDNA (Figure 3A).
After the RT-LAMP reaction, reactor 1 with no target (negative control)
remains nearly colorless, indicating the absence of dsDNA and the
lack of amplification. In contrast, reactors 2, 3, and 4 display violet
color, indicating the presence of ds DNA and successful amplification
(Figure 3B). The color
change in our experients is more significant compared with previously
reported metallochromic indicators36−38 such as calcein, hydroxynaphthol
blue (HNB). The intensity of the color appears independent of the
number of amplification templates, likely because the amplification
reactions have saturated. As an added advantage, the cassette remains
sealed during detection, which prevents contamination of the test
area by amplicons and avoiding false-positive results in subsequent
tests as it is often encountered with open systems such as when gel
electrophoresis or lateral flow strips are used for detection of amplification
products.39

Figure 3 Photographs of the isothermal
amplification reactors (A) before
and (B) after 40 min incubation in the chemically heated cup. Leuco
crystal violet dye is used as an amplification indicator. Amplification
reactors 1, 2, 3, and 4 contain 0, 5, 50, and 500 PFU of ZIKV.

Figure 3B clearly
indicates that as few as 5 PFU of ZIKV can be detected in saliva sample
with our simple, inexpensive point of care diagnostic system. In this
work, we relied on end point detection. The fluorescence intensity
change of the dye can, however, be monitored in real time with a cellphone
camera as we have previously done with intercalating fluorescent dye.18 Real-time monitoring would yield a threshold
time which can be correlated with the number of templates in the sample,
as shown in Figure 2.

To evaluate the sensitivity of our POC diagnostic system,
we compared
its qualitative performance with that of a benchtop RT-LAMP, amplifying
in each case known concentrations of ZIKV. Table 2 summarizes the number of positive experiments
normalized with the total number of tests in each category. In each
case, we have successfully detected as few as 5 PFU ZIKV per sample.

Typical viremia of a symptomatic
patient infected with ZIKV ranges
from 103 PFU/mL to 106 PFU/mL.40 The typical sample volume processed by our device is 50–100
μL. This corresponds to a detection limit better than 50–100
PFU/mL, which is more than sufficient to detect viremia in patients
infected with ZIKV. Because the sample volume that can be processed
with our device is decoupled from the reaction volume, we can increase
device sensitivity even further by increasing the sample volume.

Conclusions and Outlook
We designed and verified a set of
new RT-LAMP primers for ZIKV,
targeting the highly conserved sequence of the envelope protein-coding
region. This RT-LAMP assay facilitates rapid and sensitive benchtop
detection of ZIKV. The sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay is comparable
to that of RT-PCR. Our in-silico design of the LAMP primers suggests
high-efficiency amplification ZIKV templates and lack cross-interaction
(false positives) with any of the sequences in the GenBank database.
In this paper, we have verified that our primers are, indeed, highly
efficient. The experimental verification of the absence of cross-reactivity
with any other pathogens is deferred to future work.

More importantly,
the RT-LAMP assay can be readily adapted for
use at the point of care. To demonstrate the applicability of our
assay for point of care detection, we used our microfluidic POC diagnostic
system to detect ZIKV in saliva samples spiked with ZIKV. Our disposable,
inexpensive microfluidic cassette contains four independent amplification
reactors, each equipped with a silica membrane at its inlet for nucleic
acid isolation, purification, and concentration. This design has the
advantage of decoupling the sample volume from the reaction volume,
enabling one to use relatively high sample volumes and achieve high
sensitivity. Nucleic acids immobilized on the membrane serve as templates
in an enzymatic isothermal amplification process without a need for
an elution step, reducing the number of operations and simplifying
flow control. The cassette is combined with an inexpensive processor
composed of a chemically heated cup for electricity-free operation.
The cup generates heat for the isothermal amplification process by
an exothermic chemical reaction. The RT-LAMP products are detected
by eye with a LCV dye that changes from colorless to violet in the
presence of dsDNA.

We tested the utility of our POC diagnostic
system with raw saliva
samples spiked with various concentrations of the ZIKV. Our experiments
indicate that our electricity-free point of care diagnostic system
detects ZIKV in saliva with the sensitivity of less than 5 PFU of
ZIKV per sample within 40 min. Our POC system is comparable to that
of the benchtop assay without a need for laboratory facilities, expensive
equipment, and skilled personnel.

Further improvements of our
POC device will include the storage
of lyophilized LAMP/RT-LAMP reagents in the enzymatic amplification
reactor.41 The prestored reagents will
be protected by paraffin to avoid premature hydration during nucleic
acid extraction. When the amplification chamber is heated to its operating
temperature, the paraffin will melt and move out of the way and the
amplification reagents will get hydrated just in time.

Although
in this paper, we demonstrated only qualitative detection
of ZIKV, we anticipate that our method can be expanded to include
quantification. Indeed, in a previous work18 with a different target, we used intercalating fluorescent dye to
identify the presence of dsDNA. Our chemically heated cup interfaced
with a smartphone. The smartphone flashlight excited the fluorescent
dye and the phone camera recorded the fluorescence emission during
the amplification process. A custom-made smartphone application will
be developed to convert the images into emission intensity, analyze
the data, and determine threshold times of the amplification curves,
which is then used to estimate template concentration. The smartphone
can be programmed not only for image processing and data analysis
and reporting but also for communications and GPS recording, which
can be useful in tracking the migration of the vector. Other extensions
of our work can include multiplexing for concurrent detection of mosquito-borne
pathogens such as dengue42 and chikungunya.43

In summary, our paper describes a simple,
inexpensive, and sensitive
RT-LAMP assay and an inexpensive instrument-free POC diagnostic system
for rapid nucleic acid–based molecular diagnostics at the point
of care. This convenient, inexpensive, portable assay strategy has
the potential to meet urgent needs in endemic regions with stressed
resources.
