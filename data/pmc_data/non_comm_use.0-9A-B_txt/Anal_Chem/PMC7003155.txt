In this study, we
have prepared thermally initiated polymeric monolithic
stationary phases within discrete regions of 3D-printed titanium devices.
The devices were created with controllable hot and cold regions. The
monolithic stationary phases were first locally created in capillaries
inserted into the channels of the titanium devices. The homogeneity
of the monolith structure and the interface length were studied by
scanning a capacitively coupled conductivity contactless detector
(C4D) along the length of the capillary. Homogeneous monolithic
structures could be obtained within a titanium device equipped with
a hot and cold jacket connected to two water baths. The confinement
method was optimized in capillaries. The sharpest interfaces (between
monolith and empty channel) were obtained with the hot region maintained
at 70 °C and the cold region at 4 or 10 °C, with the latter
temperature yielding better repeatability. The optimized conditions
were used to create monoliths bound directly to the walls of the titanium
channels. The fabricated monoliths were successfully used to separate
a mixture of four intact proteins using reversed-phase liquid chromatography.
Further chromatographic characterization showed a permeability (Kf) of ∼4 × 10–15 m2 and a total porosity of 60%.

==== Body
Since their
introduction in
the chromatographic world, porous polymer monoliths have proven to
be powerful separation media. These chromatographic supports have
been widely applied for applications, such as microscale liquid chromatography
(LC) of peptides and proteins, but have also been used in capillary
electrochromatography (CEC),1 gas chromatography
(GC),2 sample preparation,3 and catalysis.4 The ease of
preparation of monoliths, diverse chemistry options, and high permeabilities
have made them popular materials for analytical devices, such as microfluidic
chips for LC.

In the past decade, miniaturization has been realized
by developing
lab-on-a-chip solutions, where several analytical processes can be
integrated within a few square centimeters. In such systems, due to
the small channels and articulated geometries, the particle-packing
procedure has proven to be challenging.5 In contrast, monolithic beds are usually created in situ by free-radical polymerization of monomers in the presence of porogens
and they are well-suited for chip-based separations. The proliferation
of microfluidic devices has spurred new interest in polymer monoliths
for applications such as enzymatic reactors6,7 and
microfluidic mixers.8 This development
has been boosted by the advent of additive manufacturing (or 3D-printing),
which allows for rapid prototyping of complex structures, converting
computer-aided-design (CAD) models into physical objects. Unfortunately,
the use of 3D-printed analytical devices for chromatographic analysis
is limited by the solvent compatibility of some materials (e.g., acrylate-based
polymers) and in some cases by their transparency at the desired wavelength
(e.g., UV or IR wavelengths). Several successful steps have been taken
to locally photopolymerize monolithic stationary phases in discrete
regions of microfluidic devices.9−12

Heat is an alternative way to transfer energy
to the monomer precursors
for initiating the polymerization. However, accurate control of temperature
in small confined spaces is more difficult to achieve, and so far
only few steps have been taken in this direction.13

In this work, two methods are explored to achieve
confined thermal
polymerization. The first approach involves direct contact (DC) between
Peltier elements and the surface of a titanium device. In the second
approach, recirculating jackets are used for localized heating and
cooling (heating/cooling jackets, HCJ). The latter approach resembles
a recirculation-based freeze–thaw valve.14 In both approaches, defined hot (HR) and cold (CR) regions
are created. We aim to fabricate poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene)
(PS-DVB) monolithic stationary phases within a 3D-printed titanium
microfluidic device through polymerization at 70 °C, and to separate
intact proteins using this device.

devices were purchased from Materialise (Leuven, Belgium), while the

(Silsden, UK).

Device Design and 3D-Printing
The
direct contact (DC)
device, shown in Figure 1a, contains two 40 × 40 mm2 pads for two Peltier
elements to be attached on the hot (red) and cold (blue) sides. A
wall thickness of 1 mm was designed between the channels (1 mm ID)
and the Peltier element pads.

Figure 1 CAD images of the two
devices: (a) Direct contact (DC) device with
two Peltier element pads for heating and cooling, (b) cross-sectional
cutaway of the heating/cooling jacket (HCJ) device with two recirculating
zones, jacket and thermocouple fittings. The scale bars in (a) and
(b) represent 10 mm.

Figure 1b shows
the heating–cooling jacket (HCJ) device, which contains two
recirculating jackets, enveloping a set of four channels (1 mm ID,
95 mm length, 1 mm wall thickness). The HCJ device essentially contains
a set of shell-and-tube heat exchangers maintaining temperatures of TH (higher temperatures) and TC (lower temperatures) in the two zones. For each jacket,
inlet and outlet slots for the recirculating fluids were included,
with a thermocouple slot to monitor the jacket temperature. To facilitate
homogeneous recirculation across the jackets and to ensure a self-supporting
geometry for 3D-printing, the jackets contained a series of baffle
fins.

CAD files (Figure S5a,b) of
the two models
were designed using Autodesk Inventor 2018 (San Rafael, CA, USA).
The model was 3D-printed with a selective-laser-melting (SLM) system
(EOS M280 (EOS, Maisach, Germany)), using a Ti 6-4 alloy (90% titanium,
6% aluminum, 4% vanadium). 10-32 HPLC threads were then tapped into
the fitting slots of the two pieces.

Experimental Setups
The DC device is in direct contact
with four Peltier elements (TEC1-12706 Hebei, Shanghai, China): two
attached to the HR, and two attached to the CR. Two CPU fans are placed
on top of the latter as heat-sinks. Two temperature controllers (STC
1000, Inkbird, Shenzhen, China) for the CR and the HR were set at TC = 19 °C and TH = 70 °C, respectively, and monitored by two thermocouples,
attached to the DC device.

The HCJ titanium device (Figure 1b) contains one inlet
and one outlet for each jacket. The heating jacket is connected to
a water bath (900F, Julabo, Seelbach, Germany) maintained at 72 °C.
The thermocouple on the titanium device reported a temperature of
70 °C. The difference can be explained by heat dissipation through
tubing connections. Continuous flow was pumped from the water bath
to the titanium device (ca. 12 L/min).

An analogous method was
used for controlling the cold region (CR)
temperature (TC). Different values of TC were evaluated, while TH was kept at 70 °C. The water bath (TC-602, Brookfield
AM, Toronto, Canada) connected to the cooling jackets was set at 2,
8.6, 25, or 35 °C. The temperatures reported by the probe placed
on the CR slot were 4, 10, 24, and 33 °C, respectively.

In Situ
Synthesis of Monolithic Stationary Phases
After
printing, the HCJ titanium device was heated at 5 °C/min up to
500 °C and kept at this temperature for 6 h in a furnace (AAF
1100, Carbolite Gero, Neuhausen, Germany). The device was then brought
back to room temperature with a ramp of 10 °C/min. After etching
the internal surface of the capillaries and the HCJ titanium device,
they were rinsed for 10 min with water and dried with nitrogen as
described by Courtois et al.15

The
surfaces of the capillaries and the oxidized HCJ titanium device were
silanized using a 20% (v/v) γ-MAPS solution prepared in EtOH
with an approximate pH of 5, adjusted using glacial acetic acid. The
solution was flushed through for 90 min at 10 μL/min. Thereafter,
the surface-modified channels were flushed with EtOH and dried with
nitrogen.

PS-DVB monolith was polymerized in situ within
the capillaries, placed inside the HCJ titanium device. The monomer
and the cross-linker were purified before use, using an alumina (Al2O3) bed. A polymerization mixture consisting of
20 wt % STY, 20 wt % DVB, 52 wt % 1-decanol, and 8 wt % THF was prepared,
and each housing was filled. Thermal free-radical polymerization was
initiated using 2 wt % AIBN with respect to the monomers, similarly
to what was described by Vonk et al.1 The
polymerization mixture was sonicated for 15 min to ensure homogeneity,
followed by 10 min purging with nitrogen to remove oxygen. The capillaries
were filled by capillary force, sealed with rubber septa, and placed
in the channels of the titanium devices. To uniformly fill the channels
in the HCJ titanium device, the four outlets on the heating side (Figure 1b, left-hand side)
were connected to capillaries, while the polymerization mixture was
pushed through the channel with a syringe from the cold (right-hand)
side. The capillaries were then sealed and the polymerization was
performed at TH = 70 °C for 24 h.
After polymerization, the monolithic columns were thoroughly flushed
with MeOH (>50 column volumes).

Physical Characterization
of Polymer Monoliths
Capacitively Coupled Contactless Conductivity
Detection
To investigate the nature of the interface between
the polymerized
and the empty zones, experiments were performed with polyimide-coated
glass capillaries inserted into the DC and HCJ devices. This choice
was mainly made to optimize the parameters of the polymerization (e.g.,
CR temperature), before synthesizing the monoliths directly in the
devices. In the capillaries, we assessed the homogeneity of the stationary
phase, the sharpness of the interface, and the repeatability using
a capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detector (C4D, TraceDec, Innovative Sensor Technologies, Innsbruck, Austria).
The latter is a noninvasive on-capillary detection method. The C4D was equipped with a probe, through which the monolithic
capillary column was placed. By moving the detector along the length
of the capillary, with a reference for length, a profile can be obtained.16 The method is based on two ring electrodes which
surround the capillary. It has been used successfully to characterize
capillary coatings,17 monoliths,18 monolithic porous-layer open-tubular (PLOT)
columns,19 particle packed columns,20 and graphene fibers.21 The C4D was used to assess the homogeneity of the monolith
in the capillaries and to evaluate the sharpness of the interface,
during setup optimization. Regions of homogeneous monolith or empty
capillary are reflected in a stable response from the detector. While
the capillary was flushed at 4 μL/min with MeOH, the conductivity
was measured for each millimeter along the capillary, in triplicate.
The C4D parameters were kept constant for each capillary
as follows: high frequency, 0 dB Volt, 50% gain, offset 0. The measured
conductivity values (Ch) for each capillary
were normalized to the highest value (Ch(max), from the unmodified capillary segment), i.e., Ch* = Ch/Ch(max).

The attachment of the monolith to the capillary
surface is another important feature that was investigated. In order
to perform chromatographic separations, wall attachment is essential
to avoid channeling or breakthrough. Permeability tests and scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images were used to evaluate the surface
attachment.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
Scanning
electron microscopy
(SEM) experiments were performed on an FEI Verios 460 instrument (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) equipped with an Everhart-Thornley
detector (EDT) using a 2 kV electron beam. The samples were sputter-coated
with a 20 nm gold layer.

Chromatographic Characterization
The performances of
the monolithic columns were assessed in terms of chromatographic behavior,
porosity, permeability, and repeatability. All chromatographic experiments
were performed on a Waters Acquity UPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA,
USA), which consisted of a binary solvent manager, a thermostated
autosampler, an air-heated column compartment, and a dual-wavelength
UV–vis (TUV) detector equipped with a 100 nL flow-cell.

Permeability
and Porosity
The permeability (Kf) was evaluated using MeOH at 20 μL/min
and 40 μL/min in all the capillaries and in the HCJ device using
Darcy’s law:22 1  where Fm is the
flow rate of the solvent, η is the dynamic viscosity of the
solvent, L is the length of the monolith, ΔP is the pressure drop across the monolithic column,
and r is the radius of the column.

Since the
SLM process used to 3D-print the titanium devices uses irregularly
shaped metal particles with a particle size range of 100–300
μm, the diameter and circularity of the HCJ channels may not
be exactly as designed. An unretained compound (KI, isocratic elution
in water at 35 μL/min) was used to determine the void volume
(V0) of the channel. The same channel
was characterized in three different states, viz., empty (EC), fully
polymerized (FC), and half polymerized (HC). FC and HC were fabricated
by introducing the precursors into the channel and polymerizing with TH at 70 °C and TC at 70 and 10 °C, respectively. Each injection was repeated
three times. The residence volume outside the channel was determined
by three injections of KI without the HCJ device installed, and this
was subtracted from all measured V0 values.

Visual inspection and C4D could not be used to study
the confinement of the thermal polymerization in the HCJ. Instead,
we used eq 2 to determine
the percentage of monolithic stationary phase formed. 2  

The t0 values were used to calculate
the total porosity (εT) according
to eq 3(23) 3  where Vg is the
geometric volume of the channel, Fm is
the flow rate of the solvent, and t0 is
the channel dead time.

In three channels, the PS-DVB monolithic
stationary phase was created
with TC = 10 °C, and these channels
were tested for the separations of proteins. A gradient (with Milli-Q
water as mobile phase A and ACN as mobile phase B, both containing
0.1% (v/v) TFA; Fm = 35 μL/min)
was employed at room temperature, using a 1 μL full-loop injection.
The chromatographic performance was assessed using a test mixture
of four proteins, i.e., lysozyme, carbonic anhydrase, cytochrome c,
and bovine casein.

Results and Discussion
Comparison of DC and HCJ
Devices Using Inserted Capillaries
PS-DVB monoliths were
created by thermal polymerization inside
capillaries, which were inserted in either the DC or the HCJ device.
The C4D scanning profiles show the detector signal across
the length of the capillary. In Figure 2, lower conductivities correspond to higher densities
of monolithic material (created in the HR of the capillary), while
higher conductivities correspond to empty (unpolymerized) parts of
the capillary (CR). A constant conductivity response across the capillary
reveals a homogeneous structure of the monolithic stationary phase.20 An ideal result from our confined-polymerization
experiments would be a C4D profile that shows a step function
with constant conductivity signals on either side of the capillary
housing (HR and CR). A sharp or nearly vertical interface between
the two zones demonstrates successful confinement.16 This ideal profile is schematically indicated by a gray
line in Figure 2 (the
absolute conductivities at the high and low end of this curve are
not relevant).

Figure 2 C4D scanning profiles of four
different capillary columns
made within the HCJ device, respectively, with the CR at 4 °C
(red, square), 10 °C (blue, circle), 24 °C (yellow, triangle),
and 33 °C (green, inverted triangle), DC device 19 °C (purple,
diamonds); and in gray the ideal step function is shown. The lower
conductivity is characteristic for the monolithic stationary phase,
while the empty capillary gives the higher conductivity.

Figure 2 shows
a
number of C4D profiles obtained. In all profiles, a significant
dip in the C4D signal is evident at the end of the CR,
causing the experimental curves to deviate from a stepwise or sigmoidal
profile. The decrease in conductivity indicates an increase in the
density of the polymeric structure. When the monolith is being formed
in the HR, the monomer concentration is reduced, while in the CR,
the monomer concentration remains constant. A potential reason may
be that the free monomers and inactive initiator diffuse from the
CR to the HR, in accordance with Fick’s law of diffusion.16 Thus, more STY and DVB monomer will be within
reach of the free radicals, leading to the formation of a high-density
frit-like structure. Another possible explanation can be thermal convection
within the channel, as hinted at by the asymmetric gradient in Figure 3b. As a result, the
polymerization section of the capillary was consistently about 55
mm long, as opposed to the designed 47.5 mm. In standard fabrication
of polymer monolithic columns, the ends of the capillary are typically
removed to overcome interface phenomena. However, this is not possible
within 3D-printed channels.

When using the DC device, which
relies on four Peltier elements
directly attached to the printed piece, the hot and cold temperatures
were set to 70 and 19 °C, respectively. The one DC curve shown
in Figure 2 (purple
diamonds and connecting line) shows a somewhat diffuse transition
from the monolith region (HR, left-hand side) to the empty region
(HC, right-hand side), extending over more than 10 mm of capillary
length. Perhaps even more importantly, the monolith does not seem
to be homogeneous as can be seen from the variations in the signal.
Several HCJ curves are shown, obtained with different CR temperatures.
The constant signals in the HR region indicate that homogeneous monoliths
have been obtained. Generally, sharper transitions are obtained at
lower CR temperatures. At TC = 33 °C,
the transition is very gradual (green line and inverted triangle),
but at TC = 24 °C, the transition
is already sharper than when using the DC device (with TC = 19 °C). At even lower temperatures, the main
ramp stretches over much less than 10 mm. The results indicate better
temperature control in the HCJ device than in the DC device. During
the polymerization, the temperature controllers on both zones of the
DC device showed fluctuations in temperature of ±5 °C, which
may explain inhomogeneities in the resulting monoliths. In contrast,
the two jackets of the HCJ setup were connected to two water baths.
The large reservoirs of water and the corresponding high thermal mass
provided stable temperatures during the entire polymerization process
(24 h). Little fluctuation was detected by the temperature controllers
(<0.5 °C), resulting in more homogeneous monoliths. Further
experimental work was continued only with the HCJ device.

Thermal Confinement
in HCJ Device
In order to test
the effects of TC on the interface, the
CR of the HCJ was set at four different temperatures, i.e., TC = 4, 10, 24, and 33 °C. At TC = 4 °C, freezing of n-decanol
may be possible (melting point 6.4 °C). To evaluate the repeatability
of confined monolithic stationary phases in capillaries, three batches
for each temperature were produced. These capillaries were then assessed
using microscopy and C4D measurements. Figure 3 shows some examples of the
images that were obtained.

Figure 3 shows that confinement was
achieved using TC = 4 and 10 °C,
but not in the 24 and 33 °C (left-side frame). The rate of AIBN
initiation is related to the temperature. At the higher TC values, the polymerization mixture partially polymerized,
even within the intended empty region. At TC = 33 °C, a clear interface could not be observed. At TC= 24 °C, an interface
was discernible (see Figure 2), but the polymer monolith was also being formed in the CR,
and so the interface length reached almost 18 mm (see Table 1). Better confinement was obtained
at TC = 4 °C and TC = 10 °C.

A quantitative summary of the C4D profiles obtained
is presented in Table 1. The stable monolith conductivity (Ch*) was defined as the average of the first 11 cm of the HR and normalized
for each capillary. The interface length (Li) was evaluated as the distance between the point where a 5% drop
in the stable monolith conductivity was observed to the point where
95% of the value corresponding to the empty capillary was reached.
The depth of the dip ΔC0 in conductivity
was measured as the difference between Ch* and the normalized conductivity at the 0 mm point on the horizontal
axis. The steepness, SL, of the profile
at the interface is defined as the maximum gradient in the sigmoidal
profile (see Figure 2).

The smallest values for Li are
obtained
at the lowest values for TC. The difference
in interface length between experiments performed at TC = 4 °C and those at TC = 10 °C is less than 2 mm. The monolith conductivity (Ch) does not vary much with TC (except for TC = 33 °C,
where no interface is observed). The intrabatch and interbatch standard
deviations are low for each value of TC. As the device contains four different channels suitable for polymerization,
the potential variation in monolith formation due to thermal inconsistencies
(brought about by channel location, e.g., edge or center) was also
evaluated (Table 1).
The polymerization is found to be only slightly affected by the channel
in which it is performed, as the intrabatch variations indicate. The
standard deviations at TC = 10 °C
are much lower than those obtained at TC= 4 °C. Therefore, we selected TH = 70 °C and TC = 10
°C as temperatures to evaluate the chromatographic performances
of the monolithic stationary phases created in the HCJ.

To apply
the HCJ confinement method to a complex microfluidic chip
such as the device for three-dimensional separations described by
Wouters et al.,24 the following considerations
have to be made. To allow the interface between empty and polymerized
zones, the location of the heating jacket must be offset by 15 mm
from the desired location of the monolith. As shown by the C4D profiles and confirmed by the SEM micrographs, the interface presents
a higher polymer density, which is likely to show a lower permeability
than the main separation body. The 4% variability in the length of
the interface within batches and the 17% between batches provides
an indication of what may be expected in applying the HCJ approach
to polymerization in multiple channels of a microfluidic chip.

The thermal confinement of polymerization does not rely on the
precision of laser-assisted photopolymerization described by Thurumann
et al.,10 nor on a photomask as described
by Yu et al.25 Confinement of UV-initiated
polymerization is technically easier than confinement of thermal polymerization,
but it requires substrates that are transparent at the wavelength
used for initiation. Our method represents a complementary solution
that can be applied to a wide variety of materials and designs with
good repeatability.

Monolith Characterization
As mentioned
above, a PS-DVB
monolith was bound to the wall of the titanium HCJ device. Such stationary
phases were created in three channels, with TH = 70 °C and TC = 10 °C.
Plots of the column backpressure as a function of MeOH at 20 and 40
μL/min were used to assess the permeability of monoliths created
using both inserted capillaries, and those fabricated directly in
the HCJ device. In the HCJ monolith, other chromatographic tests,
such as those measuring the porosity and separating intact proteins,
were also performed.

In Figure 4, the ranges of observed permeability
values (Kf; see eq 1) are indicated for each value of TC. The Kf values
obtained with TC = 4 °C exhibit greater
variability than those obtained with TC = 10 °C (see Figure 4). Despite an outlier, the columns prepared with a TC = 10 °C showed a more uniform permeability
throughout the sample set. Using this information, monoliths were
created directly in the HCJ device, with TH = 70 °C and TC = 10 °C. The
permeability of the PS-DVB monoliths created directly in the HCJ (Kf = (4.04 ± 1.96) × 10–15 m2, n = 3) was approximately half that
of the capillary housed monolithic columns (Kf = (8.08 ± 0.65) × 10–15 m2, n = 3), prepared with the same temperature
settings. These values are in the same range as those reported by
Vonk et al.26 When several monoliths are
created simultaneously in different channels within a single device,
similar variations in the permeability may be observed as those shown
in Figure 4 for TC = 10 °C.

Figure 4 Interbatch permeability of the monolithic
stationary phases created
in capillaries for different values of the cold-region temperature
(TC). Eight columns were created and characterized
for each TC. Black dots are outliers.

Potassium iodide (KI) was injected as an unretained
marker in an
empty-channel (EC) control, with the monolith synthesized directly
within the HCJ device, polymerizing half of the channel (HC) or the
full channel (FC). The t0 values for EC,
HC, and FC were 2.65, 2.35, and 2.08 min, respectively (see Figure S2). The former value was used to calculate
the true diameter of the HCJ device. The t0 peak indicates an ID of 0.91 mm, while the design value was 1 mm.
The discrepancy is probably caused by inaccuracies in the SLM process.
Using the true ID, we can infer that 53% of the channel was occupied
by the PS-DVB stationary phase (cf., eq 2), whereas in capillaries this was 57%. A value closer
to the targeted 50% suggests that direct synthesis on the HCJ walls
results in better thermal confinement, possibly due to more efficient
heat transfer from the jackets to the monomer mixture.

The t0 values were used to calculate
the total porosity, εT, for the
HC and the FC, resulting in values of 60% and 67%, respectively. The
difference is possibly due to the variation in polymer density at
the interface. The injection of KI as an unretained marker can be
used to confirm the repeatability of retention times and of the overall
length of the monoliths in the three channels of the HCJ.

Figure 5 shows a
chromatogram obtained using the HCJ device for the separation of intact
proteins. The chromatographic performance was evaluated by gradient-elution
separation of a mixture of four proteins (i.e., lysozyme, cytochrome
c, carbonic anhydrase, and bovine casein) in three HC. The separations
were carried out at room temperature. The reasonable peak shapes and
the absence of breakthrough peaks in Figure 5 (and Figure S2) confirm the presence of a homogeneous monolith that is well attached
to the walls of the channel.

within 12 min, with (1) cytochrome c, (2) lysozyme, (3) bovine casein,
and (4) carbonic anhydrase. Gradient from 10% to 22% (v/v) acetonitrile
in water (both solvents containing 0.1% v/v TFA) in 1 min and then
on to 40% in 9 min; flow rate 35 μL/min. Separation performed
at room temperature, using 1 μL loop injection and UV detection
at 214 nm.

The peak widths observed in Figure 5 are high in comparison
with those observed with other
PS-DVB monoliths in titanium devices,26,27 leading to
a relatively low peak capacity (nc = 12
using a 9 min gradient). Nevertheless, the repeatability of the chromatographic
separations in the channels was confirmed by the low relative standard
deviation of the protein retention times (see Table
S2). In a device containing several parallel channels with
monolithic stationary phases, retention times can be expected to vary
by 5–7%. While such variability is not ideal, it nevertheless
demonstrates the potential of these types of devices for use in spatial
multidimensional liquid chromatography,28 even with current separation performance.

The path to better
thermal confinement and separations lies in
pursuing higher-resolution printing methods, allowing for smaller
ID channels and sharper thermal gradients. Recent metal printing methods
are capable of resolutions of 15 μm, despite limitations in
part sizes.29 With suitable photopolymer
substrates, stereolithographic methods can produce parts with 20 μm
channels.30,31 For monolith confinement, lower IDs can
be used to better define the interface, with the main channel ID being
optimized for the final chromatographic separation.

Conclusions
Poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene) (PS-DVB) monoliths
were successfully created by thermal polymerization in targeted regions
of 3D-printed titanium devices and in inserted fused-silica capillaries.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that thermal
polymerization was used to confine monoliths in specific regions of
microfluidic devices. In comparison with UV polymerization, the thermal
approach complements our choice of devices, including those with large
internal diameters. The proposed approach opens the road to the utilization
of a wide variety of opaque (at the desired wavelength) materials
in the fabrication and application of microfluidic devices.

The thermal polymerization method can be integrated in different
3D-printed structures and in complex geometries with relative ease.
With the advent of new 3D-printable materials, such as poly(ether
ether ketone) (PEEK), glass, and ceramic materials, our approach represents
a powerful tool to combine solvent-compatible and mechanically strong
materials with diverse and customizable chemical selectivities within
a single microfluidic device. However, due to different heat capacities,
each material will require optimization of the polymerization conditions.

Furthermore, by using this approach of recirculating jackets for
fabrication and, possibly, for device operation, sample preparation
and chromatographic separation may eventually be performed within
the same device. Since chromatographic separations are greatly influenced
by temperature, the use of the jackets as column ovens can further
enhance separations within the device. Further studies have to be
performed to explore the full potential of the new approach.
