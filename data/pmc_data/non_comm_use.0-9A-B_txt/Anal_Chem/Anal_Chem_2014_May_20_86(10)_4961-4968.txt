With
the prospect of resolving whole protein molecules into their
myriad proteoforms on a proteomic scale, the question of their quantitative
analysis in discovery mode comes to the fore. Here, we demonstrate
a robust pipeline for the identification and stringent scoring of
abundance changes of whole protein forms <30 kDa in a complex system.
The input is ∼100–400 μg of total protein for
each biological replicate, and the outputs are graphical displays
depicting statistical confidence metrics for each proteoform (i.e., a volcano plot and representations of the technical
and biological variation). A key part of the pipeline is the hierarchical
linear model that is tailored to the original design of the study.
Here, we apply this new pipeline to measure the proteoform-level effects
of deleting a histone deacetylase (rpd3) in S. cerevisiae. Over 100 proteoform changes were detected
above a 5% false positive threshold in WT vs the Δrpd3 mutant, including the validating observation of hyperacetylation
of histone H4 and both H2B isoforms. Ultimately, this approach to
label-free top down proteomics in discovery mode is a critical technical
advance for testing the hypothesis that whole proteoforms can link
more tightly to complex phenotypes in cell and disease biology than
do peptides created in shotgun proteomics.

==== Body
Since the development of soft
ionization techniques over 20 years ago, mass spectrometry (MS) has
become the method of choice for untargeted protein analysis. However,
owing to the difficulty of intact protein analysis
by MS (arising from both hardware and software challenges1), the vast majority of proteomics research has
been developed and conducted using a “bottom-up” approach,
where proteins are first digested into constituent peptides prior
to MS analysis.2 Top down proteomics describes
the process for identification and characterization of intact protein
forms (i.e., proteoforms3) by mass spectrometry without the preanalytical variables introduced
by the digestion step itself.4−7 While the field of quantitative bottom-up proteomics
has undergone multiple advances in both labeled and label-free quantitation,8−10 similar advances in the field of top down proteomics to analyze
hundreds or thousands of proteoforms in quantitative fashion are not
available at present.

A major milestone in top down proteomics
has been the publication
of several studies showing the high-throughput identification of thousands
of distinct proteoforms within bacterial and mammalian cell lysates
using modern high resolution MS instrumentation coupled to nanocapillary
liquid chromatography (nLC).11−14 In studies from our group, a top down proteomics
pipeline was established to reduce sample complexity using an off-line
size-based separation (gel elution liquid fractionation entrapment
electrophoresis or “GELFrEE”) followed by capillary
LC-MS/MS of intact proteins to be detected in high resolution Orbitrap
(or FT-ICR) MS instrumentation. While these studies afforded a rich
look into the mammalian cell proteome at the intact proteoform level,
a similar pipeline for quantitative label free top down proteomics
has not yet been developed.

Several laboratories have established
approaches for the targeted
quantitation of whole proteins within a mixture of limited complexity.
One straightforward approach uses the measurement of intensity ratios
for multiple, coeluting proteoforms to establish relative quantitation
within a single sample.15 Since this intraspectrum
quantitation holds all of the information necessary within one instrument
data file, it is somewhat immune to the variability inherent within
large multisample quantitative studies. Examples of this technique
include the work of Dong et al. on the quantitation of cardiac troponin
I proteoforms in heart tissue in patients with congestive heart failure16 and the work of Chamot-Rooke et al. in the quantitation
of N. meningitides type IV pili proteoforms.17

To perform proteome-wide quantitation,
several groups have taken
both in vivo and in vitro labeling
approaches with varying success.18−21 While both approaches are well
established for comparative proteomics as they minimize technical
variation by mixing samples prior to analysis, there are a number
of challenges hindering their development and implementation on a
wide-scale basis.9,10 Du et al. used an in
vitro differential cysteine labeling strategy to quantify
intact proteins from yeast grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
Although, in theory, this strategy allows MS1-based quantitation of
protein pairs, they found that the differential tags altered chromatographic
retention time, thus interfering with intraspectrum quantitation.19 More recently, Hung et al. used in vitro tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling with isobaric tags to perform MS2-based
intrascan quantitation.21 An advantage
of isobaric tags is that labeled protein pairs should have identical
chromatographic profiles. However, because this approach uses MS2
fragmentation data for quantitation, its accurate implementation requires
only one precursor ion be selected for fragmentation, which is often
not the case in top down proteomics of complex samples.14In vivo labeling with stable
isotopes shares the chromatography advantage of in vitro isobaric labeling but circumvents the requirement for single precursor
ion isolation. In a past study, our group implemented 14N/15N labeling and quantified over 200 protein pairs from
yeast grown in the presence or absence of oxygen at the intact protein
level.18 More recently, Collier et al.
applied this strategy to human embryonic stem cells grown in culture.20 In all cases, implementation of this strategy
required the ability to label cells in vivo, thus
limiting the technique to applications where feed-stocks can be manipulated,
such as cell and tissue culture. As one of the most pressing goals
of comparative top down proteomics is the discovery of biomarkers
in clinical research (which precludes metabolic labeling of proteins),22 it is necessary to develop a statistically valid
label-free approach.

Several groups have applied label-free
quantitation to comparative
top down experiments on a few, targeted proteoforms. Yates’
group has pioneered “differential mass spectrometry”
(dMS) to perform relative quantitation of proteoforms of apolipoprotein
C–III within high-density lipoprotein particles.23−25 In another example, Taylor et al. utilized charge-state abundances
from MS1 spectra and DeCyder software to calculate the relative abundances
of large, secreted peptides (up to 60 amino acids) from cell culture
in stimulated and unstimulated cells.26 In both cases, analysis was limited to a few proteoforms and statistical
assessment was performed using a traditional Student’s t test. While acceptable for comparing two biological conditions
across a set of technical replicates, Student’s t test is insufficient to address the many sources of technical variation
inherent in complex, multilevel comparative proteomic studies; ANOVA
is required to correctly handle multiple levels of variation for quantitative
proteomics run in discovery mode.

S. cerevisiae is often the model
system to benchmark new proteomics technology; it is readily grown
to large quantities and well characterized at the protein level.27−29 Additionally, there are a number of knockout strains available enabling
the global proteomic profiling resulting from the loss of a single
gene.30 One such genetic mutant is the rpd3Δ::KANMX strain. The rpd3 gene encodes a histone deacetylase; its deletion has
been shown to increase the acetylation levels of all core histones.31 Additionally, rpd3 deletion
has been shown to increase yeast doubling times by nearly 2-fold32 and have other global effects owing to a lack
of epigenetic regulation.33

Here,
we have expanded a top down proteomics platform12,14 to include label-free quantitation of proteoforms <30 kDa for
discovery mode research (Figure 1). We developed
the platform using a hierarchical linear statistical model capable
of handling multiple levels of variation inherent to comparative proteomics
experiments. First, we present proof of principle for this analysis
through the standard addition of protein standards to a complex yeast
proteome background. We then applied this top down quantitative platform
to wild type vs Δrpd3S. cerevisiae and quantified 120 proteoform differences (54 from the nucleus,
66 from the cytosol) with false discovery rates (FDRs) for the quantitation
ranging from 5% to better than 0.0001%. A similar SILAC study was
performed by Henriksen et al. in 2012. While the main focus of the
paper was differential acetylation profiling by bottom-up proteomics,
our results are concordant with those (vide infra).34 To our knowledge, this work reports
the first analytical platform for the large-scale label-free quantitation
of whole proteins in complex mixtures using top down proteomics.

using top down proteomics. With prescribed numbers of biological and
technical replicates, a size-based fractionation of whole proteins
from a complex proteome is performed (A), followed by randomized LC-MS/MS
runs (B) and integrated application of a standard linear model for
statistical evaluation of results such as the volcano plot (panel
C, top) where each dot represents a proteoform that can be identified
and characterized (panel C, bottom).

Materials and Methods
Yeast Growth and Sample Preparation
Single colonies
of wild type Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c BY4742 and the rpd3(YNL330C) deletion mutant
(rpd3Δ::KANMX) were picked
and were inoculated into 5 mL each of liquid YPD media without and
with 0.2 g/L G-418, respectively. After overnight incubation (250
rpm @ 30 °C) and centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min, each
pellet was gently resuspended with 1 mL of liquid YPD and was inoculated
into 250 mL of YPD and YPD+G-418. Cells were harvested at OD600 = 0.7 by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 20 min. Supernatants were
discarded, and each cell pellet was washed with distilled water. The
mass of each cell pellet was measured before storage at −80
°C.

Lysis and extraction of S. cerevisiae was performed using YPER (ThermoPierce, Rockford, IL) supplemented
with 5 nM microcystin, 500 μM 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl
fluoride (AEBSF), 100 mM sodium butyrate, and 100 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT) at 2.5 mL/g wet cell weight according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. After each centrifugation step, the supernatant was saved
as the cytosolic fraction, and the protein concentration was determined.
To isolate nuclear proteins, each pellet was resuspended using 30
mL of 100 mM of sodium butyrate and centrifuged at 18 000g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove the YPER. Next, an acid/urea
extraction of the histone fraction was performed by adding 2.5 volumes
of 8 M deionized urea with 0.4 N of sulfuric acid and vortexing for
5 min and extraction on ice for 30 min. C4 solid phase extraction
(Bakerbond C4, J.T Baker) was performed, and after washing the column
with 30 mL of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water, the sample
was eluted with 3 mL of 0.1% TFA in 60% acetonitrile. Each eluted
fraction was dried and reconstituted with 1.0% sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS) solution to quantify the amount of proteins using bicinchoninic
acid (BCA) assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL).

Four hundred micrograms
of total protein was prepared for each
lane of GELFrEE per manufacturer’s instructions (Expedeon,
Cambridgeshire, UK, GELFREE 8100). Each biological replicate was separated
on a single lane of an 8%T GELFrEE cartridge (6 lanes total). Fraction
1 was collected for LC-MS/MS analysis. Ten microliters of the 150
μL fractions was used for conventional SDS-PAGE analysis and
silver stain visualization (Figure 1). SDS
was removed by methanol/chloroform/water extraction.35 Proteins were resuspended in 40 μL of Buffer A (95%
H2O, 5% AcN, 0.2% FA). Samples were centrifuged for 10
min at 21 000g at 4 °C prior to injection.

Standard Spike Experiment
Known amounts of a “Top
Down Standard” containing ubiquitin (Sigma-Aldrich, U6253),
trypsinogen (Sigma-Aldrich, T1143), myoglobin (Sigma-Aldrich, M5696),
and carbonic anhydrase (Sigma-Aldrich, C2522) were added to a fixed
background of yeast wild-type nuclear lysate (Table 1). Data analyses were performed as described below but adjusted
to analyze a simpler experiment. Samples were each injected four times
to observe technical variance.

LC-MS/MS Parameters
Resuspended
protein fractions (5
μL) were injected onto a trap column (150 μm ID ×
2 cm) using an autosampler (Dionex). A nanobore analytical column
(75 μm ID × 15 cm) was coupled to the trap in a vented
tee setup. The trap and analytical columns were packed in-house with
polymeric reverse phase (PLRP-S, Phenomenex) media (5 μm, 1000
Å pore size)36 and connected to 15
μm nanoelectrospray tips (New Objective, Waltham, MA). A Dionex
Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system was operated at a flow rate of 2.5 μL/min
for loading onto the trap. Proteins were separated on the analytical
column and eluted into the mass spectrometer using a flow rate of
300 nL/min and the following gradient: 5% B at 0 min, 15% B at 5 min,
55% B at 55 min, 95% B from 58 to 61 min, 5% B from 64 to 80 min.
Solvent A consisted of 95% water, 5% acetonitrile, and 0.2% formic
acid, and solvent B consisted of 5% water, 95% acetonitrile, and 0.2%
formic acid.

Mass spectrometry data were obtained on an Orbitrap
Elite mass spectrometer fitted with a custom nanospray ionization
source. The MS method included the following events: (1) FT scan,
four microscans, m/z 500–2,000,
and resolution 100 000 and (2) data-dependent MS/MS on the
top two peaks in each spectrum from scan event 1 using higher-energy
collisional dissociation (HCD) with normalized collision energy of
25, isolation width 50 m/z, four
microscans, and detection of ions with resolving power of 60 000.
Dynamic exclusion was enabled with a repeat count of 2, a repeat duration
of 120 s, and an exclusion duration of 5000 s. Automatic gain control
(AGC) was set to 1E6 ions, and maximum injection time was set to 1
s for both MS1 and MS2. Advanced signal processing
was turned on, and data were collected in reduced profile mode. A
15 V offset in the source was used over the entire experiment. The
capillary temperature was 320 °C and a spray voltage of 1.8 kV.

Data Processing
All data files in the quantitation
portion of the platform were processed using a collection of in-house
tools to automate data analysis. Files were analyzed for Quantitation
Mass Targets (QMTs) using a moving spectral average and deisotoped
with Thermo Fisher’s Xtract algorithm at a signal-to-noise
value of 6. All QMTs were then binned by mass (8 ppm) and retention
time (8 min) to reduce data redundancy. Intensities were normalized
using the average total ion chromatogram intensity for each technical
replicate. Finally, the QMTs were grouped and artifactual ±1
Da deisotoping errors were removed. Final QMTs were stored within
a SQLite reporting database.

Once a set of QMTs was determined,
a quantitative algorithm was applied to determine an appropriate intensity
value for each QMT across each data file. First, the isotopic distributions
of all theoretical charge states of that QMT were generated. These
distributions were then used to match against observed spectral data
and return intensity estimates for each scan. Finally, the intensity
estimates were aggregated across all scans and charge states to report
one intensity value for each data file and QMT. These data were provided
as a text file for further statistical processing (vide infra). At this point, QMTs represent individual, yet uncharacterized,
proteoforms.

For proteoform identification and characterization,
our conventional
top down proteomics pipeline was used as previously described.12,14,37 Briefly, m/z data for each precursor/fragmentation scan pair were converted
to monoisotopic neutral mass values using ProSightHT within ProSightPC
3.0.38 Data were used to search an annotated S. cerevisiae database (stored as a.pwf file called
“server_yeast_complex_Apr3_2013”) which was built against
UniProt release 2013_04. Mass tolerances for precursor ions were set
to 10 ppm. A 10 ppm mass tolerance was also used for the fragment
ions. Low confidence proteoform identifications were excluded by requiring
those hits arising from an absolute mass search to have an E-value
below 1 × 10–4.14 A more stringent E-value cutoff of 6 × 10–5 (corresponding to a P-value cutoff of 9 × 10–8) was applied to hits derived from a biomarker search as previously
reported.39

Statistical Analysis
Proteoforms may not be observed
in all samples; this creates the “missing values” problem
in label-free methods. To address this, intensity data on the occurrence
of putative proteoforms (QMTs) were tabulated, and those not occurring
in at least 50% of all data files were excluded from further analysis.
This removed 67% and 83% of potential QMTs in the nucleus and cytosol,
respectively. Intensity values for the remaining QMTs were log2-transformed so that differences in estimated treatment-level
intensities could be interpreted on a fold-change scale. Two separate
ANOVA analyses were performed: ANOVA-1 and -2. For the first analysis,
ANOVA-1, intensity levels for each QMT were standardized to Z-scores
across all samples. ANOVA-2 used unstandardized intensity values.
ANOVA-1 was used to test the statistical significance of QMT intensity
changes between the wild type and Δrpd3 mutant
strains, while ANOVA-2 was used to estimate the size of the effect
(expressed as fold-change). In both analyses, a hierarchical linear
model was employed as the general statistical approach. The fixed
effect hierarchical linear model allows for nested effects and can
be expressed as Iijk =
μ + Ai + Bj(ik) + Ck(ij) + εijk. In ANOVA-1, “I” represents the QMT intensity Z-score, while in ANOVA-2,
this represents the log2-transformed intensity. In both
models, μ is the true mean, A is the treatment
factor levels (wild type and Δrpd3), B is the biological replicates, C is the
technical replicates, and ε is the residual variance. QMTs showing
significant treatment*biological replicate effects were excluded from
further analysis. In ANOVA-1, all p-values were corrected
for multiple testing at a false discovery rate of α = 0.05.40 All statistical analyses were performed within
SAS 9.4, (SAS Institute, Cary NC).

Results and Discussion
Quantifying
Known Protein Abundances within S.
cerevisiae Lysates
As a proof of principle,
we first performed an experiment in which we spiked a known amount
of a set of intact protein standards into a yeast nuclear protein
extract background at three known levels. To test the fitness of our
approach to perform label-free quantitation, we examined the precision
and accuracy of the method using three standard proteins (ubiquitin,
myoglobin, and trypsinogen; Table 1). Normalization
to the total ion count observed in the LC-MS run proved valuable for
improving the precision and accuracy of quantitation in the top down
proteomics data set. While uncorrected intensity data showed a coefficient
of variation (CV) range of 19–49%, normalization reduced that
to a range of 8–20% (Table 1, Figure S1). The accuracy of the method varied.
For a 3-fold change (3X vs 1X), we observed a range of 2.2–3.4-fold.
For a 4-fold change (12X vs 3X), we observed a range of 2.2–3.3-fold.
For a 12-fold change (12X vs 1X), we observed a range of 6.8–11.4-fold.
Pairwise Student’s t tests for each of these
three comparisons were significant at α = 0.05.

Applying the
Method in Comparative Fashion: WT vs Δrpd3S. cerevisiae
To evaluate the quantitative
platform in an unknown system, we employed
a comparative proteome analysis of wild type vs Δrpd3 S. cerevisiae (depicted in Figure 1). A 2 × 3 × 7 study design (i.e., two states, three biological replicates, and seven technical replicates)
was established, and the cytosolic and nuclear fractions were assessed
separately. Proteins in these compartment extracts were first separately
resolved into one simple fraction ranging from 3.5–30 kDa using
GELFrEE followed by LC-MS/MS as described above.

Next, we applied
the hierarchical linear model to quantify intact proteoforms within
our yeast experiment. A random effects model was applied to this experiment,
and the results are shown in Figure S2.
The majority of the variance was confined to the residual term, “ε”,
of the hierarchical linear model. The contributions of the technical
variation from LC-MS procedures was quite small in comparison (Figure S2). To gain a birds-eye view of proteoform-level
changes, we performed an unsupervised clustering of Z-scores at the
biological replicate level (Figure 2). This
data representation provides a visual depiction of the high reproducibility
of the approach and its ability to striate different sets of proteoforms
by their response to deletion of the rpd3 gene.

Figure 2 Hierarchical
clustering of each of 120 proteoforms found to change
significantly (i.e., 5% FDR or better) in the Δrpd3 mutant vs WT strains separated by nucleus and cytosol.
The clustering diagram used the Z-score approach to score each proteoform
across averaged technical replicates, applied to biological replicates
and then clustered via an unsupervised approach. Notice that although
the clustering was unsupervised, biological replicates from all wild
type and Δrpd3 runs cluster together.

Using the method detailed above,
we created a volcano plot which
represented each proteoform (i.e., QMT) as a function
of estimated effect size (in log2 fold-change) and the
statistical confidence (the FDR) that there was a difference in normalized
intensity between the two states “wild type” and “Δrpd3” (Figure 3). As expected,
masses fall to each side of the line indicating “no change,”
where to the left are found proteoforms more highly expressed in wild-type
than in the Δrpd3 mutant. Proteoforms identified
to the right were upregulated in Δrpd3 as compared
to WT. Of the 838 QMTs detected in total, 120 of them showed a statistically
significant intensity change between wild type and Δrpd3 at or below the 5% FDR threshold, with the most confident
of these approaching an instantaneous FDR value of 1 × 10–6 (Figure 3). Overall, the nuclear
and cytosolic compartments showed changes in 54 and 66 proteoforms,
respectively (Figure 3A,B and Tables S1–S4).

Figure 3 Volcano plots generated to compare the WT vs
Δrpd3 strains of S. cerevisiae S288c for
GELFrEE fractions from the (A) nuclear and (B) cytosolic cellular
compartments having 54 and 66 proteoforms, respectively, below the
5% FDR threshold (dotted red line). Assignment of analytical variation
is shown in Figure S1. In Figure 4, the quantitation of
four of these proteoforms is explored in greater detail. The corresponding
data points are highlighted above—red ■ = diacetylated
histone H4, red ▲ = triacetylated histone H4, green ▲
= N-acetylated ZEO1, green ■ = N-acetylated + phosphorylated
ZEO1 (phosphorylation localized between Q12 and T48).

These data demonstrate that the integrated method
and statistical
model are capable of detecting significant differences in proteoform
abundance among treatment groups. Of the QMTs confidently found to
change, we used a combination of tandem MS and intact mass tag (IMT)41 information to map each QMT to a proteoform.
Of the 120 QMTs, 71 were unambiguously identified as proteoforms using
MS/MS information obtained during the LC-MS runs. An additional five
were less-confidently identified using the IMT approach with a 10
ppm tolerance to match protein mass tags obtained from a prior publication
reporting >900 yeast proteoforms.39 With
these data, 63% of QMTs were confidently identified as proteoforms
while the platform was run in discovery mode.

Within the cytosolic
fraction, three of the 66 confidently changing
QMTs were related to the protein ZEO1 (UniProt Accession Q08245).
ZEO1 is a peripheral membrane protein implicated in the cellular stress
response.42 Our qualitative analysis identified
three different proteoforms. Unmodified ZEO1, N-acetylated ZEO1, and
N-acetylated + phosphorylated ZEO1 (phosphorylation localized between
Q12 and T48). Of the confident QMTs, our quantitation platform detected
a significant change between Δrpd3 and WT for
both the N-acetylated ZEO1 (two QMTs map to one proteoform) and N-acetylated
+ phosphorylated ZEO1 (Figure 4A, Tables S2 and S4).
The abundance of the N-acetylated proteoform was 2.3-fold lower in
the Δrpd3 mutant as compared to the wild type
(most confident instantaneous FDR = 1 × 10–6). The doubly modified proteoform’s abundance was reduced
by a factor of 5.0-fold in the Δrpd3 mutant
as compared to the wild type (instantaneous FDR = 5 × 10–4). Most of the proteins seen to be downregulated in
mutant cytosol (Table S2) are involved
in the stress response and glycolysis.43,44

Figure 4 (A) Quantitation
of three proteoforms from the cytosolic protein
ZEO1. Box and whisker plots are presented at the biological replicate
level of Z-scores for each of three proteoforms are shown along the
right-hand side. The singly acetylated ZEO1 and the acetylated + phosphorylated
ZEO1 show significant changes; the unmodified form was not considered
within the analysis because it was observed in fewer than 50% of the
technical replicates. (B) Quantitation of histone H4 proteoforms.
Box and whisker plots (panels at right) are presented for the histone
H4 proteoforms with 2, 3, and 4 acetylations. Again the monoacetylated
and tetraacetylated proteoforms were not considered within our analysis
because they was observed in <50% of the technical replicates.
In all cases, mass spectra are the sums of individual scans across
its full elution time within a single technical replicate. The symbol
** indicates significant (p < 0.05) proteoform
abundance changes as reported by our platform.

In the nuclear fraction, several of the most confidently
changing
proteoforms belong to the core histone family. The analysis showed
a general hyperacetylation of histone H4 (UniProt Accession P02309)
within the Δrpd3 mutant as compared to WT (Figure 4B, Tables S1 and S3).
This hyperacetylation is evidenced by increased QMT abundance of the
triacetylated proteoform in Δrpd3 as compared
to WT (8.4-fold change, instantaneous FDR = 4 × 10–6). Simultaneously, the diacetylated proteoform was found to be downregulated
in Δrpd3 as compared to WT (0.6-fold change,
instantaneous FDR = 4 × 10–3). ANOVA analyses
of the monoacetylated and tetraacetylated proteoforms were not meaningful
because intensity values were not present in one of the treatment
levels. These “single-state” cases are easily extracted
from the intact proteoform area measurements, displayed as boxplots
in Figure 4. While the data within this figure
show only one technical replicate of each treatment level, similar
histone H4 proteoform PTM patterns were seen in all 42 individual
technical replicates as a function of treatment level (Figure S3). Given Rpd3’s known function
as a histone deacetylase and previous reports in both yeast and human
cells, the hyperacetylation of histone H4 is not surprising.31,45 Among other core histones, three proteoforms of histone H2B show
significant quantifiable differences for both of its two distinct
gene products, H2B.1 and H2B.2 (UniProt Accessions P02293 and P02294).
Interestingly, histone H2B.1 shows a more confident degree of hyperacetylation
than does histone H2B.2 (Figure 5 and Table S1).

Figure 5 Quantitation of histone H2B.1 and H2B.2
proteoforms across the
WT vs Δrpd3 strains of S. cerevisiae S288c. H2B.1 proteoforms are shown in dark blue and red respectively
between WT and Δrpd3. H2B.2 proteoforms are
shown in light blue and orange respectively between WT and Δrpd3. Box and whisker plots at right show the significant
hyperacetylation of histone H2B.1 (decrease in abundance of unacetylated
and increase in abundance of diacetylated) but fail to show a similar
trend for histone H2B.2 (although levels of the monoacetylated H2B.2
are decreased within Δrpd3).

Proteoform-level quantitation offers some advantages
over its peptide-level
counterparts. Chief among those is the coverage of multiple and diverse
modifications afforded by measuring the whole protein. In the cases
demonstrated in Figures 4 and 5, peptide-level measurements would have great difficulty to
simultaneously quantify correlated changes in multiple modifications
in a proteotypic (gene-specific) fashion. For example, histone H2B.1
and H2B.2 are 97% identical in protein sequence and contain a large
number of lysine residues. Tryptic digestion would sever the linkage
between modifications co-occurring on the same molecule and would
provide an unclear view of isoform-specific regulatory events (particularly
prevalent in higher eukaryotes). To compare our results to a recent
SILAC study looking at the effects of global changes upon deletion
of rpd3, over 60% of the proteins quantified in this
study map to differentially expressed peptides in that report.34

Future directions of this platform include
its extension to more
complex experimental designs and its packaging within a software solution.
We conclude that our platform is capable of label-free quantitation
of intact proteins using top down proteomics and hierarchical linear
modeling. We also will extend this method to more complex samples
to determine if proteoforms can provide insight into complex phenotypes
observed in the human population.

Conclusion
We
forward this approach to demonstrate that quantitative top down
proteomics is possible to do in multitarget discovery space. In a
model yeast system (with peak finding and statistical approaches implemented
with stringency in mind), confidence values up to one in a million
were possible to obtain for quantitative measurements of whole proteins
in the <30 kDa regime. Extension to primary material from human
population studies will likely reduce this level of confidence relative
to the clonal yeast population used here. The statistical power generated
by the method will improve with better reproducibility of laboratory
protocols and fine-tuning of data pipelines. However, the technology
is now ready to employ to test the hypothesis that whole proteins
can correlate tightly to overall human phenotypes in disease populations.
One value proposition is that proteoform discovery and validation
will provide robust, protein-based biomarkers that can detect disease
early and guide the development of therapeutics in the future of 21st
century biomedicine. Such activities have commenced using the technology
described and validated in this work.
