Assessing
the physical stability of proteins is one of the most
important challenges in the development, manufacture, and formulation
of biotherapeutics. Here, we describe a method for combining and automating
circular dichroism and intrinsic protein fluorescence spectroscopy.
By robotically injecting samples from a 96-well plate into an optically
compliant capillary flow cell, complementary information about the
secondary and tertiary structural state of a protein can be collected
in an unattended manner from considerably reduced volumes of sample
compared to conventional techniques. We demonstrate the accuracy and
reproducibility of this method. Furthermore, we show how structural
screening can be used to monitor unfolding of proteins in two case
studies using (i) a chaotropic denaturant (urea) and (ii) low-pH buffers
used for monoclonal antibody (mAb) purification during Protein A chromatography.

==== Body
The majority
of biologics are
recombinant proteins produced by engineered microbial, plant, or animal
cells, and processes for their manufacture rely on harmonious integration
of a complex series of upstream and downstream operations.1 The stringent requirements for proving that biotherapeutic
protein products are correctly folded into the active three-dimensional
(3D) structure is a vital concern of the biopharma industry. Proteins,
especially large complex human proteins, exhibit a propensity to unfold
and aggregate in response to often quite small changes in the process
environment.2,3 Loss of structural integrity is
a recognized factor in reducing a drug’s therapeutic efficacy
and invoking immune responses in patients.4,5

The considerable number of factors that influence biotherapeutic
quality attributes has contributed to a series of risk-based initiatives
governing their manufacture.6 These measures
aim to safeguard product consistency, quality, and purity by ensuring
that the manufacturing process remains substantially the same over
time. Important among these is the Food and Drug Administration’s
guidance on Process Analytical Technology (PAT) within the pharmaceutical
sector.7−9 In the case of biotherapeutic protein targets, where
maintenance of the correct 3D structure is essential for drug efficacy,
improved understanding of the impact of processing environments relies,
in large part, on the development of robust high-throughput analytical
techniques capable of effectively monitoring a given protein’s
structural state at all stages during processing and formulation.10

Circular dichroism (CD) and intrinsic
fluorescence are sensitive,
nondestructive biophysical techniques employed for studying changes
in the solution-state conformation of proteins.11,12 CD is a spectroscopic technique that measures the differential absorption
of left- and right-handed circularly polarized light. Asymmetric absorption
of the peptide backbone in the far-UV region provides an excellent
means of measuring changes in the total secondary structure of a protein,
while absorption in the near-UV region arising from aromatic amino
acids provides a good indicator of tertiary structure changes. Intrinsic
protein fluorescence is a complementary technique that provides information
on the state of protein structure from changes in the local environment
of aromatic amino acid residues.13−17

An existing challenge with using CD and fluorescence
together for
routine structural screening is that instruments are not configured
for use in an industrial setting, where speed and autonomy are paramount.
Conventionally, far-UV CD is carried out in quartz cuvettes with a
path length of 0.1 cm, requiring ∼200 μL protein samples
of 0.1–0.2 mg/mL.11 Unless a CD
spectrometer has been specifically adapted with a dedicated fluorescence
detector, fluorescence spectra are gathered using a separate instrument
in a different cuvette. As both protein sample and buffer spectra
must be collected (ideally in the same cuvette for CD) with cleaning
between measurements, performing spectral analyses on many samples
can be time-consuming. Further, the optical constraints of CD render
the use of traditional plate reader type formats difficult, motivating
past approaches to increase sample throughput either by increasing
the number of cuvettes using a carousel holder18 or employing a liquid handling robot to load a fixed-position,
square-faced cuvette.19

A different
approach to increasing sample throughput has been taken
in this work, inspired in part by the pioneering work of Synovec and
Yeung,20,21 and in particular, building on an earlier
study by Waldron et al.22 who introduced
an ultralow volume system for CD comprising an extruded quartz capillary
as the optical cell (replacing the standard quartz cuvette) and modified
optical configuration. Specifically, we detail the systematic development
and validation of an automated high-throughput capillary-based CD/fluorescence
(ht-caCD/F) measurement system and demonstrate its utility as a PAT
tool for bioprocess development work. First, we describe the components
of the measurement system, placing special emphasis on pairing the
optically transparent flow cell with an optical arrangement that maximizes
low-wavelength performance. Second, we show how sample delivery was
optimized to allow highly efficient transfer of samples as small as
40 μL containing just 4 μg of protein. Finally, we employ
the ht-caCD/F system as a PAT tool for (i) monitoring conformational
changes of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and a monoclonal antibody (mAb)
under chemical denaturing conditions and (ii) measuring changes to
the structure of the mAb on exposure to 24 different buffers spanning
pHs of 2.2–8.05.

Experimental Section
Materials
The
quartz capillary (3.5 mm o.d, 1.20 mm
i.d) and PEEK tubing (1.59 mm o.d., 0.25 mm i.d.) employed for construction
of the flow cell were purchased from Enterprise-Q (Manchester, Lancs,
U.K.) and BGB Analytik Vertrieb GmbH (Rheinfelden, Germany), respectively.
Both the uncoated UV fused-silica double convex lens (25 mm diameter,
50 mm effective focal length; cat. no. 48-294) used to focus the light
beam in front of the flow cell and focusing lens mount were provided
by Edmund Optics Ltd. (Nether Poppleton, York, Yorks, U.K.). Corning
96-well NBS microplates were acquired from Corning Life Sciences B.V.
(Amsterdam, The Netherlands), and the bioinert Rheodyne model 9010
six-port injector was supplied by Merck KgaA (Darmstadt, Germany).
The purified humanized IgG1 mAb used in this work targets the HER2
receptor and was provided by Pall Biotech (Portsmouth, Hants, U.K.)
at a stock concentration of 10 mg/mL in 10 mM sodium phosphate pH
7.1 buffer. Prior to sample preparation, 0.3 mL aliquots of stock
mAb were exchanged into water by means of size exclusion chromatography
using PD MiniTrap G-10 columns (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden), and
mAb concentration was determined in a spectrophotometer assuming A279nm1% = 15.0. Bovine serum albumin Cohn fraction V (fatty acid free, low
endotoxin, lyophilized powder; A279nm1% = 6.67) and chemicals, glycine
(≥98.5%), anhydrous sodium acetate (≥99.0%), and (1S)-(+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) ammonium salt, were
obtained from Merck KgaA (Darmstadt, Germany). Glacial acetic acid
(≥99.7%), hydrochloric acid (∼37%), urea (≥99.5%,
Electran molecular biology grade), sodium dihydrogen orthophosphate
dihydrate (≥99.0%), and anhydrous disodium hydrogen orthophosphate
(≥99.5%) were supplied by Fisher Scientific U.K. (Loughborough,
Leics, U.K.). Citric acid monohydrate (≥99.7%) and trisodium
citrate dihydrate (≥99.0%) were acquired from VWR International
(Leighton Buzzard, Beds, U.K.), and Hellmanex II special cleaning
concentrate was from Hellma GmbH & Co. KG (Müllheim, Germany).
All other materials were obtained from Merck KgaA (Darmstadt, Germany),
and all solutions were prepared using deionized water (resistivity
15.0 MΩ·cm at 22 °C) purified by a PURELAB Option-R
Ultra water purification system (ELGA LabWater, High Wycombe, U.K.).

Instrument Overview
Figure 1A shows a schematic representation of the
automated sampling system developed using parts from a high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) system plus an extruded quartz capillary
cut from a length supplied by Enterprise-Q. It comprises a modified
autosampler (Jasco AS-2055) and HPLC pump (Jasco PU-1580) configured
to inject protein samples into a quartz capillary flow cell held in
the beam path of a Jasco J-1500 CD spectrometer (Jasco U.K. Ltd.,
Great Dunmow, Essex, U.K.) which is focused down to the 1 mm wide
capillary window of the sample holder. During sample loading, sample
is drawn from a 96-well plate using a three-axis robotic needle, and
then transferred to a holding loop for injection. A mobile phase of
deionized water transfers sample to the capillary, and on reaching
the flow cell, flow is stopped. The CD spectrometer and fluorescence
detector are then electronically triggered to analyze the sample.
Fluorescence spectra are recorded using an Ocean Optics HR2000+ CCD
array detector with a fiber-optic cable attachment (Ocean Optics,
Largo, FL, U.S.A.). CD and absorbance spectra are simultaneously collected
thereafter by the CD spectrometer.

circular dichroism and fluorescence
system. The autosampler retrieves sample from a 96-well plate, and

by a pump profile programmed on the HPLC pump. (B) Front view of flow
cell with dimensions. (C) Annotated isometric view of the flow cell
and focusing lens.

Flow Cell Design
A flow cell was constructed by carefully
tapering the ends of two pieces of PEEK tubing (60 and 2 cm) with
a scalpel to allow their insertion (∼5 mm deep) into either
end of a 3 cm length of quartz capillary (Figure 1B). Araldite rapid two-part epoxy glue was
applied to the joints, which were then heated over a Bunsen flame
to create tight seals. The long PEEK delivery tube of the flow cell
was attached directly to the column outlet of the autosampler’s
six-way valve (Figure 1A) in order to reduce the volume from injection valve to capillary
down to ∼30 μL, and flexible PTFE waste tubing was connected
to the short PEEK exit tube. A 3D-printed capillary mounting (Figure 1, parts B and C)
designed using AutoCAD software (AutoDesk Inc., San Rafael, CA, U.S.A.)
was employed to securely fix the capillary within the beam and immediately
in front of the instrument’s photomultiplier tube (Figure 1A). The capillary
mounting features 1 mm wide apertures at the entrance and exit faces
of the capillary (Figure 1, parts B and C) to mask the capillary edges from incoming
light, thereby ensuring that light reaching the detector has passed
through, and not around, the contained sample. An opening at 90°
to the incident beam was made in the capillary mounting (Figure 1, parts A and C)
in order to accommodate the SMA-905 attachment of the fiber-optic
cable for detecting fluorescence, and a 2.5 cm quartz biconvex lens
of 5.0 cm focal length was fitted to the sample stage of the spectrometer
to focus light onto the front face of the capillary and enhance spectral
resolution (Figure 1, parts A and C).

Sample Handling
To eliminate potential
sample adsorption
within the flow path, the stainless-steel needle, transfer tube, and
holding loop of the autosampler were all replaced with PEEK tubing.
Sample dilution on delivery was minimized by adjusting the autosampler’s
aspiration settings to separate the sample from the flanking mobile
phase by sandwiching between two air bubbles (“double”
air-segmented delivery), the sizes of which were adjusted by altering
the volume of air drawn before and after the sample. Further, to limit
potential dilution of analytes by residual mobile fluid on the flow
path walls, the use of an additional air bubble encased sacrificial
wash sample traveling immediately ahead of the bona fide sample (“triple”
air-segmented delivery) was also explored; schematic illustration
is provided in Figure S1. For information
on the settings employed for two and three air bubble segmented sample
delivery, refer to Table S1.

The
pump was programmed to load samples at a flow rate of 5.5 μL/s,
and the timings were set so that flow stopped immediately following
full sample entry into the capillary (Table S2). After analysis, samples were ejected from the flow cell at a flow
rate of 16.7 μL/s. The autosampler was programmed to perform
five consecutive flushes of the needle and transfer tubing after each
injection. To avoid cross-contamination from sample carryover, a solution
of 2% (v/v) Hellmanex II was loaded after each protein sample. Buffer
blank, protein sample, and cleaning agent elements were arranged in
repetitive pattern across a 96-well plate, and the plate was tightly
sealed with plastic wrap to prevent evaporation of sample during measurement
time.

Optical Measurement
The CD spectrometer was used to
collect CD and absorption spectra and provide a source of excitation
light for fluorescence detection. Depending on the nature of individual
experiments, CD data were collected in time course, step scanning,
or continuous scanning modes; the settings used in each case are given
in the accompanying figure legends. Fluorescence excitation was carried
out with a wavelength of 290 nm, bandwidth of 9 nm, and digital integration
time (DIT) of 3 s (unless otherwise stated), and emission spectra
were collected at 90° with a 25 cm length of 1 mm core diameter
fiber-optic cable to take the light to the detector. The path length
of the capillary flow cell (1.18 mm) was determined by comparing the
amplitude of the high-wavelength 292 nm peak of a 1 mg/mL solution
of CSA in deionized water with that obtained using the 1 mm standard
cuvette.

Automation
The HPLC pump, CD spectrometer, and fluorescence
detector were electronically interfaced in order to synchronize scanning
routines with sample injection (Figure S2). Two event channels were assigned within the HPLC pump profile
to provide separate triggering control for the CD and fluorescence
spectrometers. A Raspberry Pi model B+ (Raspberry Pi Foundation, Cambridge,
Cambs, U.K.) was used as a central hub to receive event channel signals
from the HPLC pump and initiate spectrometers. A potential difference
of 3.3 V was applied to the two-event channel termini of the HPLC
pump, so events could be detected via two pull-down input general-purpose
input/output (GPIO) pins on the Raspberry Pi. A program written in
Python version 3.5.0 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350/) was used to process incoming event channel signals and relay them
to external trigger pins of the spectrometers via output GPIO pins
(Table S3).

The CCD array fluorescence
detector was grounded via pin 5 of its input/output terminal, and
the device was triggered to record multiple spectra by applying a
3.3 V pulse to pin 10, which could be programmed to last the desired
integration time within the program running on the Raspberry Pi (Table S3). Fluorescence spectra were recorded
and saved during the signaling interval using the “software
input” mode of the accompanying Ocean Optics SpectraSuite software.

Triggering of the CD spectrometer was controlled via a relay switch
circuit, comprising an NPN transistor (S8050) and relay switch (SRD-05VDC-SL-C)
(SunFounder starter kit V2.0 for Arduino). A 3.3 V output signal from
a Raspberry Pi GPIO to the transistor base terminus was used to close
the circuit between positive and negative trigger pins of the CD spectrometer
and initiate the macro sequence. Macro commands for the initiation
of CD and fluorescence scanning routines (Table S2) were written in Jasco Spectra Manager II. Upon the CD spectrometer
receiving an external signal, macro commands open the beam shutter
to expose the sample to excitation light for fluorescence, and an
event signal is sent to the CCD array detector to trigger the collection
of fluorescence spectra. Once fluorescence spectra have been collected,
the shutter is closed, and the monochromator then resets to carry
out CD scanning routines. Macro commands were enclosed in a loop function
to allow the reiteration of this program with the loading of each
new sample. A program written in Python 3.5.0 was used to accumulate
and average fluorescence.txt files following data collection (Table S3).

Results and Discussion
Design
and Calibration of the Flow Cell
In contrast
to conventional flat-walled CD sample chambers, the use of curved
walls of the capillary might be expected to convey some optical distortion.
To test the capillary-based CD/fluorescence (ht-caCD/F) measurement
system (Figure 1) for
its suitability in automated bioprocess development work, calibration
data were collected from samples of 1 mg/mL CSA (Figure 2A) and 0.1 mg/mL BSA (Figure 2B). CD spectra were
recorded using the capillary flow cell “with” and “without”
the focusing lens, and optical quality was compared to spectra collected
in a standard 1 mm path length quartz cuvette. For ease of comparison,
the 1 mm cuvette ellipticity data were scaled to a 1.18 mm path length
(i.e., multiplied by 1.18).

Figure 2 Optical comparisons of a quartz capillary flow
cell (with and without
focusing lens) and a standard quartz cuvette conducted using (A) 1
mg/mL CSA and (B) 0.1 mg/mL BSA. Spectra were measured in step scan
mode (bandwidth = 1 nm, and DIT = 1 s). Individual CD spectra and
HT voltage traces from six consecutive scans were averaged. Spectral
“noise” plots (standard deviation in CD, σ vs
wavelength) corresponding to the averaged CD spectra in panels A and
B are shown in panels C and D, respectively. The standard cuvette
data were multiplied by 1.18 for direct comparison with the capillary
data. Key: cuvette (blue lines); capillary (red lines); capillary
with focusing lens (green lines); CD spectra and spectral noise (solid
lines); HT (dashed lines).

The data show that CD spectra from the capillary closely approached
the quality achieved with a standard cuvette (Figure 2). The acquired spectra highlight the important
role of the focusing lens in significantly improving light flux through
the sample chamber [represented by a lower high-tension (HT) voltage; Figure 2, parts C and D],
thereby reducing spectral noise across the entire wavelength range
(185–270 nm). The two-point CSA calibration ratios23 were −2.00 for the “capillary
flow cell + lens” setup; cf. −2.03 for the cuvette (Figure 2A). Small deviations
(more noticeable for BSA; Figure 2B) only become apparent below 200 nm due to increased
HT voltage (i.e., lower photon flux) at lower wavelengths.

Secondary
structure deconvolution performed on the derived BSA
spectra using SELCON324 and CDSSTR25 algorithms (reference data set 4, 240–190
nm) gave very similar average α-helix contents of 63 ±
3% for the cuvette cf. 60 ± 4% for the “capillary + lens”
arrangement, demonstrating that the use of a capillary sample chamber
had no significant impact on structural interpretation.

Sample
delivery was optimized in experiments employing BSA injected
independently at three different concentrations (0.1, 0.3, and 0.5
mg/mL in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) through the flow cell
at a flow rate of 5.5 μL/s, without stopping flow (Figure 3). The CD spectrometer
was set to record at a wavelength of 222 nm, at which BSA displays
a strongly negative elliptical signal. Resulting “CD222nm vs time” profiles for three different sample injection modes
are shown in Figure 3A–C. The maximum CD222nm values derived from these
are plotted against the BSA loading concentration (Figure 3D), and the impact of sample
volume on transfer efficiency is also shown (Figure 3E).

Figure 3 Comparison of direct and air-segmented sample
delivery to the capillary
flow cell. “CD222nm vs time” flow profiles
arising from delivery of 40 μL of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 mg/mL BSA
to the flow cell at a flow rate of 5.5 μL/s by (A) direct injection
into the carrying stream, (B) double air (20 μL first leading
air/40 μL sample/20 μL trailing air), and (C) triple air
(20 μL first leading air/20 μL sacrificial wash sample/20
μL second leading air/40 μL sample/20 μL trailing
air) segmented injection. Measurements were made in time course measurement
mode (bandwidth = 2 nm; measurement interval = 0.5 s; DIT = 0.5 s).
Three injections of each sample were performed, and averaged profiles
are shown. (D) “Maximum CD222nm vs BSA loading concentration”
and (E) “transfer efficiency vs sample volume” (0.1
mg/mL BSA was used) for direct (dash-dotted line), double air-segmented
(dotted line), and triple air-segmented (dashed line) sample injections
into the capillary flow cell and normalized static measurement in
the standard cuvette (solid line). The error bars in panels D and
E derive from three repeated injections at each concentration.

Direct injection of 40 μL samples into the
mobile carrier
phase (Figure 3A) resulted
in nearly 5-fold dilution (Figure 3D) due to zone broadening upon transfer to the flow
cell. To limit sample diffusion in the carrying fluid, the sample
aspiration settings of the autosampler were modified to introduce
discrete volumes of air either side of the sample, i.e., one immediately
in front, the other immediately behind. The bubbles of air appear
in the flow profiles (Figure 3, parts B and C) as concentration-independent positive ellipticity
signals on either side of the protein sample, arising as a result
of distortion to the path of light passing through an air-filled capillary.

The effectiveness of air bubble segmented sample injection in eradicating
the gross sample dilution by the mobile phase cf. direct injection
(Figure 3A) is demonstrated
in Figure 3B–E.
The delivery of a 40 μL sample sandwiched between two 20 μL
air bubbles, i.e., “double air” segmented injection
(Figure 3B), increased
the “carried sample” concentration 4-fold to 87.3 ±
0.6% of the theoretical maximum ellipticity, i.e., assuming no dilution
of sample (Figure 3D). Variation in segmenting air bubble size between 5 and 30 μL
revealed some sample bleed with the smallest bubbles tested (5 μL),
but the carrying concentration of sample protein (measured as CD222nm) appeared independent of bubble volume over the examined
range (Figure S3).

The efficiency
of sample carriage could be improved yet further
(Figure 3C) to 98.6
± 0.8% of the theoretical εmax (Figure 3D) by introducing an air bubble
segmented “sacrificial sample” (20 μL) immediately
ahead of the “measured” sample (40 μL). This sacrificial
sample served to “buffer” the impact of dilution on
the main analyte caused by residual mobile phase in the flow path
or capillary. An important advantage of this “triple”
air-segmented sample delivery is that it permits delivery of much
smaller sample volumes at high transfer efficiency (Figure 3E). For example, 20 and 40
μL samples of 0.1 mg/mL BSA can be delivered at efficiencies
of 97.5 ± 2.7% and 98.6 ± 0.8%, respectively, cf. 70.7%
and 87.3% for double air-segmented and just 9.9% and 21.9% for direct
injection modes. In each instance, the independent delivery of protein
to the flow cell showed highly reproducible flow profiles and concentrations.

Collection of full CD and fluorescence spectra using automated
triple air-segmented sample delivery was subsequently evaluated by
loading varying concentrations of BSA and mAb in the ht-caCD/F system
and pausing flow for scanning routines. Specifically, this entailed
preparing multiwell plates containing repeated sequences of buffer
blank, protein sample, and 2% (v/v) Hellmanex cleaning solution and
automatically collecting CD and fluorescence spectra from 40 μL
samples loaded independently three times. Parts A, C, and E of Figure 4 show the CD, absorption,
and fluorescence spectra obtained for five different concentrations
of BSA (0.05–0.25 mg/mL) in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer,
pH 7.4, averaged across three independent repeat injections. The CD
spectra (Figure 4A)
display the characteristic shape expected for BSA (RCSB PDB ID 3V03), an α-helical
protein with intense negative maxima at 222 and 208 nm arising from
the n−π* and parallel π–π* transitions,
respectively, and a positive maximum at 192 nm assigned to the perpendicular
π–π* transition.26

Figure 4 CD (A
and B), UV absorption (C and D), and fluorescence (E and
F) spectra of BSA (left) and mAb (right) acquired with the ht-caCD/F
system. Triple air-segmented delivery was employed to inject 40 μL
samples of BSA (in 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) and mAb (in 10
mM sodium phosphate and 154 mM NaF, pH 7.1) loaded at concentrations
of 0.05–0.25 mg/mL. Each sample was loaded three times at a
flow rate of 5.5 μL/s, and the averaged spectra are shown. CD
spectra (A and B) were collected in continuous scan mode with the
following parameters: bandwidth = 2 nm; scan speed = 100 nm/min; DIT
= 1 s; averaging over five scans per sample. Fluorescence spectra
(E and F) were averaged over 14 accumulated scans per sample (DIT
= 3 s).

The fluorescence emission spectra
are characterized by a single
peak, maximal at 344 nm (Figure 4B), arising from the contributions of two tryptophan
residues, one (Trp-135) located in the second α-helix of domain
IB in a solvent-exposed hydrophobic pocket close to the protein surface
(λmax = 348 nm), the other (Trp-214) buried deep
in BSA’s interior within the hydrophobic pocket of domain IIA
(λmax = 332 nm) participating in a hydrophobic packing
interaction at the IIA–IIIA interface.27−31

CD spectra of mAb (Figure 4D) have the character of an antiparallel
β-sheet-rich
immunoglobulin, with a positive maximum at 202 nm assigned to the
π–π* transition, a negative maximum at 217 nm from
the n−π* transition, and a distinctive broad shoulder
near 230 nm that has previously been ascribed to contributions from
aromatic side chains.32,33 The intrinsic fluorescence spectra
(Figure 4F) have a
λmax at 338 nm, resulting from the predominant contribution
of tryptophan. The corresponding absorbance spectra of BSA and mAb
(Figure 4, parts B
and E) are both typical of absorption from the peptide backbone, with
a peak at 190 nm and shoulder at 220 nm.

With the ht-caCD/F
system’s strong optical performance and
consistent automated sample delivery confirmed, we next explored the
ht-caCD/F systems potential as a PAT tool in bioprocess development
in two industrially relevant case studies, namely, (i) monitoring
the unfolding of BSA (a well-characterized and frequently employed
model protein) and a therapeutic mAb under increasing concentrations
of the chaotropic agent urea and (ii) testing the stability of a therapeutic
mAb across a range of pH used in downstream purification.

Case Study
1: Denaturation by Urea
Chaotropic agents
such as urea or guanidine hydrochloride are frequently used to probe
the unfolding events of biological molecules and are widely employed
in industrial bioprocessing settings, e.g., for the resolubilization
of inclusion bodies or as stabilizing additives in elution buffers.34,35 Here, we employed the automated ht-caCD/F system to interrogate
structural changes induced in BSA and mAb following 1 h of exposure
to various concentrations (0–8 M) of urea.

The addition
of low concentrations of urea (1 and 2 M) to BSA resulted in no observable
change to its CD spectrum (Figure 5A). With increasing urea concentration beyond 3 M,
however, significant loss in α-helical content occurred; the
far-UV CD spectrum (Figure 5, parts A and B) became progressively less negative, and the
magnitude of the 222 nm maximum diminished in roughly linear fashion
with increase in urea concentration between 2 and 7 M (Figure 5B). At the highest urea concentration
employed (8 M), the 222 nm maximum observed in the native BSA spectrum
was no longer visible, but the negative shoulder between 215 and 230
nm implies that BSA, though denatured, is not completely unfolded,
i.e., it exists in a denatured constrained state devoid of long-range
order.36−38

Figure 5 Case study 1a: using ht-caCD/F to interrogate protein
unfolding.
BSA (2.25 mg/mL) in 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4 was diluted 9-fold
with varying amounts of urea (in the same buffer) and mixed (1 h,
room temperature) to give samples with final BSA and urea concentrations
of 0.25 mg/mL and 0–8 M, respectively. Triple air-segmented
delivery was employed to inject 40 μL samples. Each sample was
loaded twice, and obtained spectra were averaged. (A) CD spectra were
collected in continuous scan mode with the following parameters: bandwidth
= 2 nm; scan speed = 100 nm/min; DIT = 1 s; averaging over five accumulated
scans per sample. (B) CD222nm vs urea concentration. (C)
Fluorescence spectra were averaged over 14 accumulated scans per sample
(DIT = 3 s). (D) λmax (solid line) and normalized
fluorescence intensity (dotted line) vs urea concentration. The error
bars correspond to the standard deviation of two independent measurements.

The fluorescence emission spectra corresponding
to the Figure 5A CD
data show urea
concentration-dependent quenching of tryptophan fluorescence (Figure 5C), with little quenching
observed at lower concentrations and strong quenching above 3 M urea,
with normalized fluorescence intensity falling to ca. 50% at 7 M urea
(Figure 5D). The fluorescence
wavelength maximum, λmax (Figure 5D), undergoes gradual blue (hypsochromic)
shifting over the 0–5 M urea concentration range (falling from
344.8 to 340.6 nm) followed by strong red (bathochromic) shifting
between 5 and 8 M urea (λmax reaching 349.1 nm).
These results are in strong agreement with urea-dependent hypsochromic
and bathochromic shifts in BSA’s fluorescence emission spectrum
reported previously,30 and likely reflect
a two-stage rearrangement of the protein’s packing structure.
In the first stage, we envisage limited unfolding by low concentrations
of the chaotrope (1–5 M urea) creates a more hydrophobic environment
around Trp-214, resulting in the observed hypsochromic shift, and
in the second, high chaotrope concentrations (6–8 M urea) induce
extensive unfolding and exposure of tryptophan residues to a polar
solvent environment, and a concomitant bathochromic shift.

The
unfolding of mAb in urea differed markedly from that exhibited
by BSA. With increasing urea concentration the mAb showed little conformational
change until 6 M urea (Figure 6). The CD spectra showed most variance at low wavelengths,
which were largely obscured by the cutoff limit arising from urea
absorbance at ∼210 nm (Figure 6, parts A and B). Loss of β-sheet structure was
reported at 213 nm in the presence of ≥6 M urea, and at 8 M
a small change at 238 nm was also observed. A considerable bathochromic
shift of the fluorescence signal at 7–8 M urea indicates extensive
unfolding of protein structure at high chaotrope concentrations, reaching
346.3 nm at 8 M cf. 337.6 in native state (Figure 6D). This red shift coincided with a dramatic
increase in fluorescence intensity (reaching twice the native emission
at 8 M urea). Unlike BSA, the intrinsic fluorescence emission of the
native state was more quenched than in the denatured state, which
is typical of immunoglobulin domains due to the close proximity of
tryptophan residues to disulfide bonds in the folded conformation.39,40

Figure 6 Case
study 1b: using ht-caCD/F to interrogate protein unfolding.
mAb (1.80 mg/mL) in 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.1 was diluted 9-fold
with varying amounts of urea (in the same buffer) and mixed (1 h,
room temperature) to give samples with final mAb and urea concentrations
of 0.20 mg/mL and 0–8 M, respectively. Triple air-segmented
delivery was employed to inject 40 μL samples. Each sample was
loaded twice, and obtained spectra were averaged. (A) CD spectra were
collected in continuous scan mode with the following parameters: bandwidth
= 2 nm; scan speed = 100 nm/min; DIT = 1 s; averaging over five accumulated
scans per sample. (B) Fluorescence spectra were averaged over 14 accumulated
scans per sample (DIT = 3 s). (C) CD222nm vs urea concentration.

Case Study 2: mAb Stability Testing
Protein A chromatography
is the most widely used initial capture step in antibody purification
in industry. The high affinity of Protein A for the Fc region of immunoglobulin
facilitates >95% purification in a single processing step. However,
low-pH elution buffers are required to break the protein’s
interaction with resin, often ranging from pH 2.5 to 4.41,42 Furthermore, in pharmaceutical operations, mAbs are incubated following
elution at low pH for long periods of time for viral inactivation.5 The acidic conditions used in mAb downstream
processing are often considered to contribute to the deterioration
in product integrity.43 In particular,
Protein A chromatography is frequently associated with increased inactivation
rates due to aggregation.35,44 Thus, it is important
to understand the acid tolerance of mAb products on a case-by-case
basis.

This work has employed automated ht-caCD/F to interrogate
the structural transitions of mAb (0.20 mg/mL final concentration)
formulated in buffers commonly employed during the various stages
(loading, washing, elution, viral hold) of Protein A affinity chromatography
(Figure 7). Twenty-four
different buffers spanning the pH range of 2.2–8.05 were tested
(i.e., sodium phosphate, pH 5.85–8.05; sodium acetate, pH 3.9–5.5;
sodium citrate, pH 3.1–6.15; glycine–hydrochloric acid,
pH 2.2–3.4), and these were employed at 20 mM so as to maintain
low background absorption in the far-UV region.

Figure 7 Case study 2: monoclonal
antibody stability testing. Twenty-four
different buffers spanning the pH range of 2.2–8.05 were tested
with mAb at a final concentration of 0.20 mg/mL, i.e., 20 mM sodium
phosphate (pH 8.05, 7.65, 7.10, 6.60, 6.20, and 5.85), sodium acetate
(pH 5.50, 5.05, 4.60, 4.25, and 3.90), sodium citrate (pH 6.15, 5.75,
5.35, 5.00, 4.65, 4.30, 4.00, 3.60, and 3.10), and glycine–hydrochloric
acid (pH 3.40, 3.00, 2.60, and 2.20). Triple air-segmented delivery
was employed to inject 40 μL samples. Each sample was loaded
twice, and the obtained spectra were averaged. (A–D) CD spectra
were collected in continuous scan mode with the following parameters:
bandwidth = 2 nm; scan speed = 100 nm/min; DIT = 1s; averaging over
four accumulated scans per sample. (E–H) Fluorescence spectra
were averaged over five accumulated scans per sample (DIT = 4 s).
(I) CD203nm vs pH. (J) λmax vs pH. (K)
Normalized fluorescence intensity vs pH. Error bars correspond to
the standard deviation of two independent measurements.

At near-neutral pH values (encountered during loading and
washing
phases) the CD (Figure 7A) and fluorescence (Figure 7B) spectra (Figure 7I–K) indicate little variation in mAb structure between
pH 8 and 6. With further reduction in pH from 6 to 3, a slight gradual
drop in ellipticity at 203 nm from ∼10 to 8.5 mdeg (Figure 7I) is paralleled
by a 1 nm red shift in λmax (from 337 to 338 nm; Figure 7J) and marked drop
(>20%; Figure 7K)
in
fluorescence intensity. The stronger fluorescence quenching of aromatic
residues within the mAb by citrate cf. acetate (Figure 7, parts F, G, and K) is likely due to preferential
accumulation of quenching citrate ions near the mAb’s surface.43−46

More significant perturbations to mAb structure are observed
as
the pH is reduced yet further from ∼3 to 2.2, with CD revealing
severe loss of β sheet structure (CD203nm falling
from >8 mdeg to <0.5 mdeg; Figure 7, parts D and I) and fluorescence spectra
showing strong
red shifting of λmax (from 338 to 342 nm; Figure 7, parts H and J),
but no further quenching (Figure 7, parts H and K). The spectral changes recorded here
are in keeping with two phase structural rearrangements previously
observed for immunoglobins exposed to low pH,47,48 with onset of unfolding occurring below pH 6 and severe distortion
of structure evident below pH 3.

Conclusion
CD
and fluorescence spectroscopy provide valuable insights into
the intricate unfolding events of proteins. The automation of a system
that integrates an automated loading robot and low-volume capillary
flow cell with these orthogonal spectroscopic techniques has been
described and evaluated with respect to (i) loading method, (ii) data
quality, and (iii) sample requirements. We found that air-segmented
delivery of samples was the best loading method, and the use of a
fixed-position quartz capillary flow cell afforded consistently high-quality
spectra. Further, we showed that reproducible and high transfer efficiency
loading could be achieved using sample volumes as low as 40 μL.
Thus, this system provides a number of benefits that include eliminating
manual sample loading and cleaning procedures, reducing sample requirements
by up to 5-fold, and increasing productive machine time for prolonged,
unattended running periods. In an industrial or research setting,
these advantages could translate into important time and cost savings.

The presented case studies demonstrated the utility of ht-caCD/F
for rapidly evaluating the distinct unfolding patterns of secondary
and tertiary elements of protein, delivering precisely the results
expected had CD and fluorescence measurement been conducted in conventional
manner. Under increasing concentrations of urea, unfolding of BSA
was seen to occur at >2 M via an intermediate state at 5 M urea,
whereas
mAb retained it structure up to >6 M urea. It is noteworthy that
operation
of the ht-caCD/F system was unperturbed by the high viscosity of concentrated
(8 M) urea solutions. In a process development application, unfolding
of an IgG1 in various low-pH buffers was shown to occur via a two-stage
unfolding sequence, with partial unfolding occurring between pH 6
and 3 and severe unfolding below pH 3. Quickly gathering such information
can be invaluable for informing the choice of appropriate processing
or formulation conditions to reduce the risk of costly downstream
failure. In an industrial biomanufacturing setting, we envisage further
adaption of the described system to collect structural data from proteins
as they elute off chromatography columns. While chiral detection of
optically active compounds in HPLC systems has hitherto proven useful
for the detection of biologically significant small molecules,20,21 the combination of new, sensitive CD and fluorescence detectors
with capillary flow paths presents a promising opportunity to monitor
conformational changes of eluted proteins and overcome the sensitivity
issues reported in previous endeavors.49
