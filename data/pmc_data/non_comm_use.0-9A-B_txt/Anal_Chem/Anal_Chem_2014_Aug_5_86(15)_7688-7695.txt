A critical problem in materials science
is the accurate characterization
of the size dependent properties of colloidal inorganic nanocrystals.
Due to the intrinsic polydispersity present during synthesis, dispersions
of such materials exhibit simultaneous heterogeneity in density ρ, molar mass M, and particle diameter d. The density increments ∂ρ/∂d and ∂ρ/∂M of these
nanoparticles, if known, can then provide important information about
crystal growth and particle size distributions. For most classes of
nanocrystals, a mixture of surfactants is added during synthesis to
control their shape, size, and optical properties. However, it remains
a challenge to accurately determine the amount of passivating ligand
bound to the particle surface post synthesis. The presence of the
ligand shell hampers an accurate determination of the nanocrystal
diameter. Using CdSe and PbS semiconductor nanocrystals, and the ultrastable
silver nanoparticle (M4Ag44(p-MBA)30), as model systems, we describe a Custom Grid method implemented
in UltraScan-III for the characterization of nanoparticles and macromolecules
using sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation. We show
that multiple parametrizations are possible, and that the Custom Grid
method can be generalized to provide high resolution composition information
for mixtures of solutes that are heterogeneous in two out of three
parameters. For such cases, our method can simultaneously resolve
arbitrary two-dimensional distributions of hydrodynamic parameters
when a third property can be held constant. For example, this method
extracts partial specific volume and molar mass from sedimentation
velocity data for cases where the anisotropy can be held constant,
or provides anisotropy and partial specific volume if the molar mass
is known.

==== Body
Ligand-stabilized
nanoparticles
and quantum dots (QDs) have become important materials in a wide variety
of applications including nanomedicine,1 sensing,2 and optoelectronics.3 Because key elements of these applications are
tailored around the nanoscale properties of the particles’
inorganic core and organic ligand shell, there is a pressing need
for methods that can reliably quantify the heterogeneities within
the particle’s two components. Although transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) has become a routine tool to determine the shape
and size of the inorganic core in high-resolution detail, any organic
materials bound on the nanocrystal surface are usually impossible
to discern, due to their low atomic contrast. Yet, in many instances,
it is the hydrodynamic radius and overall core and shell properties
that are of interest. For instance, in applications related to drug
delivery and biomarkers, the efficacy and toxicity of the nanoparticles
are both size and surface property dependent.1,4 In
QD-based photovoltaics5 and transistors,6 it is becoming increasingly clear that progress
in device performance is contingent upon the judicious engineering
of the ligand shell, which plays a pivotal role in the transport properties,7 surface passivation,8 and self-assembly7 of QD solids. Hence,
it is essential to be able to measure parameters related to overall
hybrid particle (inorganic core and organic ligand shell) properties
as they influence solubility, electronic properties, assembly and
reactivity.

Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) is a solution-based
fractionation
technique that allows the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic characterization
of colloids, where all components in a dispersion can be detected
and measured. It is based on first-principle transport models and
does not require any standards. It is the only technique so far proven
to be sensitive to minute changes in the density and size of both
the core and shell components of nanoparticles, all the while providing
robust statistics that give a complete picture of a sample in question.9−18 For these reasons, AUC is the premier technique for the characterization
of nanoparticles in the solution environment.

In AUC, large
centrifugal force fields (up to 250000g) are used
to sediment macromolecules or nanoparticles in an appropriate
buffer solution. The particles will sediment by forming a moving boundary,
which creates a concentration gradient that also induces diffusion
flux. Both sedimentation and diffusion transport are measured over
time by observing changes in the concentration profile during the
experiment. This transport process separates particles according to
their hydrodynamic properties, which include mass, friction, and density.
These properties determine the sedimentation and diffusion coefficients
for each particle. The analysis of the data is then tasked with identifying
individual sedimentation and diffusion coefficients of any particles
with distinct hydrodynamic properties. Traditional sedimentation analysis
approaches parametrize the sedimentation and diffusion coefficients
of the sedimenting particles in terms of the frictional ratio and
molar mass, while a constant partial specific volume for all particles
is assumed.19−24 For proteins and other biopolymers, this is often a good assumption,
and small errors resulting from slight deviations in the partial specific
volume, most often due to solvation, have negligible effects on the
obtained sedimentation coefficient, and somewhat larger discrepancies
in the molar mass transformations are typically tolerated. On the
other hand, such a parametrization may lead to significant error when
studying nanoparticles, which frequently have a constant frictional
ratio (i.e., a fixed anisotropy or shape), and a broad range of partial
specific volumes due their variable core–shell structure. But
in some cases, a constant anisotropy can be established by inspecting
the particles by TEM, or where X-ray crystallography structures are
available, the molar mass is known, and the anisotropy can be estimated
with programs like UltraScan-SOMO.25,26

In this
work, we present a new generalized analysis approach and
software implementation ideally suited for nanoparticles, quantum
dots, and macromolecular systems for which some parameters like anisotropy,
density, or mass are known a priori, and can be used as a constraint
in the fit of the sedimentation velocity (SV) experimental data to
obtain the unknown hydrodynamic parameters. When mixtures of particles
are expected, it is important that the constrained parameter stays
constant during the experiment for all species in the mixture. This
approach is termed the Custom Grid method, and is implemented in UltraScan-III,27 a well-known, freely available software package
for the analysis of sedimentation experiments that models the data
with linear combinations of finite element solutions28,29 of the Lamm equation.30 This method employs
a parametrization of the sedimentation coefficient s and diffusion coefficient D that relies on constraints
in either molar mass M, frictional ratio φ,
or partial specific volume ν̅. When the anisotropy is
known, φ can be held fixed to obtain both ν̅ and M. When ν̅ is known, φ and M can be obtained. In all cases, the sedimentation and diffusion coefficients
can be obtained. By performing a search over a two-dimensional grid
of possible parameter values, mixtures with heterogeneity in either
of the two fitted parameters can then be resolved. An arbitrary parametrization
of the sedimentation and diffusion space can be obtained using the
following six relationships: 1   2   3   4   5   6  where V is the volume of
a solvated particle (eq 1), N refers to Avogadro’s number, r0 is the radius of the minimal sphere with frictional coefficient f0 (eq 2). f0 can be obtained from the Stokes–Einstein relationship
(eq 3), which defines the frictional coefficient
for a spherical particle in a solvent with viscosity η and radius r0. The frictional ratio is a measure of the
particle’s anisotropy, and is given by f/f0 (eq 4). The frictional
ratio relates the frictional coefficient of any anisotropic particle
to the frictional coefficient of a sphere which has the same volume
as the particle. R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

To resolve heterogeneities
in the two parameters in question, the
Custom Grid approach discretizes the unknown parameters into a two-dimensional
grid. For example, if M is used as a constant constraint,
the grid can be built over ν̅ and φ, whereas when
φ is used as a constant constraint, the grid can be built over
ν̅ and M. We demonstrate the utility
and validity of the presented method by analyzing SV data using the
Custom Grid approach from a series of CdSe and PbS QDs of varying
sizes, and the ultrastable silver nanoparticle M4Ag44(p-MBA)30.31−33 Notably, we were able to directly
measure the density, size and molar mass distributions of the hybrid
ligand-stabilized nanocrystals, and the anisotropy and partial specific
volume of the silver nanoparticle with high statistical significance
because AUC experiments measure many more particles than are available,
for example, in electron microscopy experiments. We show that this
approach can be used for both heterogeneous as well as monodisperse
solutions. The analysis presented in this work, along with its user-friendly
software implementation, paves the way toward the adoption of SV as
a standard characterization tool for nanoparticle and QD researchers.

Data
Analysis
The change in concentration C along
the radius r and over time t of
a sedimenting and
diffusing particle in the analytical ultracentrifuge is described
by the Lamm equation L (eq 7),30 with boundary conditions m (meniscus) and b (bottom of the AUC cell): 7  

The solution of this
equation requires knowledge of the sedimentation
coefficient s, diffusion coefficient D, and the angular velocity, ω. Given these parameters, a complete
solution can be found using the adaptive space-time finite element
method (ASTFEM28,29). In the fitting approach, a
grid of s and D parameter pairs
is constructed such that all sedimenting particles are represented
by one of the grid points. Each grid point represents a complete finite
element solution, and the final solution encompassing the total concentration CT of all solutes is given by the linear combination
(eq 8): 8  where L is the Lamm equation
solution for grid point i, j, and xi,j represents
the concentration of particle i, j. If the particle is not present, its concentration will be set to
zero by the fitting algorithm. A non-negatively constrained least-squares
fitting algorithm34 is used to determine
the partial concentration of all species described by the grid points,
and to filter out nonexisting species in a series of refinement steps
that are performed by the two-dimensional spectrum analysis (2DSA,
see section SI-1, Supporting Information).35 Because the construction of the initial
grid domain is left up to the user, it is important that the parametrization
of the grid reflects molecular properties that are meaningful to the
investigator. In the case of the CdSe and PbS samples, the anisotropy
is known to be globular from TEM, and the parameters of interest are
either the s or M for the first
grid dimension, and the density or ν̅ in the second dimension.
In the case of the silver nanoparticles, M is known
from the crystal structure and instead φ and the density are
of interest. To achieve the appropriate parametrization, we assume
a constant anisotropy for the CdSe and PbS QDs, discretize s with the desired resolution, and reparameterize the diffusion
coefficient using eq 9, which we obtain from
substituting eqs 1–5 into eq 6: 9  

Here,
ρ is the density of the solvent and all other parameters
are as described earlier. For the silver nanoparticle analysis, we
discretize ν̅ in eqs 1 and 5, φ in eq 4, and substitute f from eq 4 into eqs 5 and 6 to obtain our grid. The final
model for the QD analysis is represented by a modification of eq 8, where D is expressed as a function
of s and ν̅ at constant frictional ratio
φ, as shown in eq 10, and for the silver
nanoparticle analysis, the final model expresses both s and D as a function of a grid over ν̅
and φ at constant molar mass M (eq 11): 10   11  

The approach presented here is general and
can also be applied
to biological macromolecules and synthetic polymers. It permits multiple
parametrization options, allowing for the creation of other custom
grids that can incorporate constraints available from a variety of
experimental sources (mass spectrometry, X-ray crystallography, NMR,
electron microscopy, densitometry, and others). Using eqs 1–6, transformations
of the variable grid parameters to any nonconstant parameter of interest
are possible. For this purpose, UltraScan provides a convenient module
(see Figure S-1, Supporting Information) to create and display arbitrary custom grids that can be fitted
with the 2DSA method, either on a local computer or on a remote supercomputer,
and allows the user to combine multiple subgrids for selected regions
of the parameter domain into a global supergrid. If the subgrids represent
individual species with different partial specific volumes, as may
be encountered when a mixture composed of polymers with dissimilar
chemical composition (DNA, proteins, carbohydrates, complexes, etc.)
is analyzed, each subgrid can be constructed with a separate partial
specific volume (see Figure 1C,D). Such a grid
requires prior knowledge about the approximate position where each
species sediments. This can be obtained by measuring each component
individually before placing it into a mixture. All grids are simulated
in standard parameter space (adjusted to water at 20 °C), as
are the results. Corrections for temperature, solvent density, and
viscosity are made transparently in UltraScan using user-supplied
buffer conditions and experimentally derived temperature values. For
grids based on absolute molar mass, correct values for either ν̅
or φ, as well as buffer density and viscosity are required to
allow UltraScan to automatically map the custom grid to the corresponding s–D pairs. It is also possible to
simulate floating particles with densities lower than the solvent
density, but the software will automatically exclude solutes with
sedimentation coefficients ranging from −0.2 to +0.2 s from
the selected parameter range (Figure 1A,B).
In such a case, the particle will neither sediment nor float, even
at the highest speeds possible in currently available instruments.
For highly heterogeneous mixtures, it is possible to define logarithmically
spaced grids to provide a better resolution for a wide coverage in
molar mass, or to create multimodal grids. Several grid examples are
shown in Figure 1, which illustrates these
options.

Figure 1 Visualization of Custom Grid custom grid examples. Shown are comparisons
between molar mass (A, C) and sedimentation coefficient (B, D) views
of selected custom grid representations for experimental systems containing
continuous partial specific volume changes (A+B) and grid regions
with discrete partial specific volumes (the partial specific volume,
with units mL/g, used for the grid definition is indicated for each
corresponding grid region). The example shown in panels A and B permits
fitting of both sedimenting and floating particles, with nonsedimenting
species excluded from the grid where s-values are
between −0.2 and +0.2 s. Note the exponential grid spacing
when regular molecular weight grids are translated to sedimentation
coefficients. Both examples show grids linear in the molecular weight
dimension, but the UltraScan software also permits the definition
of grids that are linear in the sedimentation coefficient parameter.

Experimental Methods
Analytical Ultracentrifugation
CdSe QD samples were
measured in their native solvent, 1-octadecene at 20 °C with
density and viscosity of 0.789 g/mL and 4.32 cP, respectively. PbS
samples were run in octane containing 5% oleic acid at 20 °C
with density and viscosity of 0.7054 g/mL and 0.611 cP, respectively.
For CdSe samples, SV experiments were performed at 50 000 rpm
for 10.61 Å, 25 000 rpm for 17.05 Å, and 18 000
rpm for 20.15 Å CdSe QDs. Data were obtained by collecting the
intensity between 300 and 700 nm at radial lengths between 5.98 and
7.2 cm. Radial intensity data were extracted at 484 nm for 10.61 and
17.05 Å QDs and at 529 nm for 20.15 Å QDs. In all cases,
wavelengths were chosen where the intensity of the xenon light source
is high while the optical density of the sample is between 0.2 and
0.8. For PbS samples, experiments were performed at 8000 rpm with
424 nm detection. The silver nanoparticle (M4Ag44(p-MBA)30) was dissolved by placing a few microliters
of slurry in 50 mM NaOH and vortexing for 5 min until well dissolved.
A dilution of 0.6 absorbance units at 425 nm was measured at 30 000
rpm. Between 100 and 200 scans were collected for all experiments
in intensity mode (see Figures S-2–S-7, Supporting Information, for experimental and fitted SV data,
and residuals). Between 0.4 and 0.45 mL were loaded for each sample.
Further details about AUC equipment and the details of the QD synthesis
are listed in section SI-2 (Supporting Information).

Results and Discussion
Numerous studies have used AUC
to study hybrid inorganic–organic
colloidal systems.16,17,36,37 Typically, in order to access the particle
size information such as the molar mass and the hydrodynamic diameter
using AUC, the average density of the particle must be known and this
is usually problematic for systems containing both inorganic and organic
components. In addition, the level of solvation is unknown, as is
its effect on the anisotropy of the particle. For QDs, the majority
of the aforementioned studies generally assumed a certain particle
density by estimating the organic ligand shell thickness. There are,
however, reports that employed the use of complementary techniques
such as thermogravimetric analysis and total organic carbon analysis
to directly measure the number of polymers bound to the particle surface.38 Alternatively, techniques such as dynamic light
scattering (DLS), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), and
asymmetric flow field flow fractionation (AFFFF) can also be utilized
to independently measure the diffusion coefficient and the hydrodynamic
particle size.39

For the quantum
dots, three sizes of CdSe and two sizes of PbS
particles ranging between 10.61 Å and 20.15 Å were analyzed.
The final particles consist of an inorganic core and an organic ligand
shell. As illustrated in Figure 2, the difference
between the total particle radius, Rtotal and the radius of the core, Rcore, reflects
the thickness of the compact shell containing organic surfactants
and solvent molecules. The shell thickness and its total mass can
provide information about the ligand packing density on the particle
surface as well as the ligand conformation. CdSe and PbS core sizes
can be determined using the band edge calibration methods,40,41 where the absorption maxima at the first exciton bands yield the
particle diameter (see Figure S-8, Supporting
Information). Direct inspection of TEM data suggests spherical
shape (φ = 1) and verifies homogeneity in anisotropy for PbS
and CdSe for all particles in the mixture (see Figure S-9, Supporting Information).

their organic ligand shells. Rtotal indicates
the radius of the solvated QD–ligand core–shell.

For the silver nanoparticle, an
X-ray crystallography-derived structure
is available.31 From this crystal structure,
a one-bead-per-atom bead model with atomic van der Waals radii was
constructed and used to estimate both the anisotropy and the volume
of the unsolvated particle. This estimate is performed with the Zeno
method42 implemented in UltraScan-SOMO25,26 (see section SI-1, Supporting Information, for an explanation of the method). The hydrodynamic radius, the
translational diffusion coefficient, and the frictional ratio of the
unhydrated particle can be directly computed using the Stokes–Einstein
relation (eq 3), and using the same equation,
and the computed volume, the frictional coefficient of the minimal
sphere can be calculated. Together, the two frictional coefficients
provide φ (eq 4). From the computed volume
and the known mass of the particle, ν̅ of the unhydrated
particle can be computed. We note that in our calculation, the volume
contributions from the hydrogens were not included, because they were
not available in the crystal structure, with only a negligible error
expected.

Results obtained from the Custom Grid–Monte

of the CdSe and PbS samples are listed in Table 1; results for the silver nanoparticle analysis are shown in Table 2. Experimental data, finite element fits, and residuals
are shown in Figures S-2–S-7 (Supporting
Information). Diffusion-corrected van Holde–Weischet

plots demonstrating the particle ν̅, s, and the relative solute concentrations of the five QD particles
are shown in Figure 3.

of CdSe and PbS
QDs demonstrating their partial specific volume (PSV) distributions
with respect to their sedimentation speeds (standardized to water
at 20 °C) and their partial concentrations, which is given by
the color scale in the right y-axis. Blue, CdSe 10.61;
green, PbS 12.60; red, PbS 15.00; magenta, CdSe 17.05; cyan, CdSe
20.15, also compare Table 1.

From these data, an inverse correlation between
ν̅
and s is apparent for all particle size distributions.
Particle sedimentation velocities are proportional to the particle
mass and size, but their size is inversely proportional to their diffusion
coefficients. Furthermore, particle diffusion and sedimentation speeds
are also affected by their densities. The average bulk density of
the stabilizing ligand mixture is approximately 0.87 g/mL, whereas
those of the PbS and CdSe particle cores are 7.60 and 5.19 g/mL, respectively.
Consequently, the overall density of smaller nanocrystals is less
than that of larger nanocrystals, because the lower density ligand
occupies a higher volume fraction of the smaller nanocrystals. This
relationship is evident when the trend for ν̅ as a function
of Rtotal is examined. As judged by the
integral distributions of the solute populations shown in Figure 3 (right panel), the density and sedimentation coefficients
of the majority of the solutes are fairly monodisperse. However, some
heterogeneity is apparent in some of the samples (Figure 3, left panel). Relationships between particle sedimentation
and diffusion speeds, mass and density of CdSe and PbS with respect
to particle core size are illustrated in Figure S-10 (Supporting Information) using the results from
Table 1. As expected, the sedimentation speed,
the particle molar mass, the total particle volume, and the hydrodynamic
size all have a positive relationship with QD core size. Within the
particle size distribution of a solute, the heterogeneity in density
can be observed. For CdSe, the average particle density was found
to vary between 2.5 g/mL for 10.61 Å particles and 2.9 g/mL for
20.15 Å particles. As expected, the density rises with increasing
particle size as the core volume fraction rises. For PbS QDs, the
change in particle density for the two studied sizes is much greater
than that observed for CdSe. The average overall density of 12.6 Å
PbS QDs is 2.91 g/mL and 3.38 g/mL for 15.0 Å PbS QDs. The difference
can be explained by the combination of the high core density, 7.6
g/mL for PbS compared to 5.19 g/mL for CdSe, and the lower amount
of bound surfactants. CdSe QDs have oleylamine and trioctylphosphine
ligands bound to both Cd and Se sites, whereas for PbS, each oleic
acid molecule is bound to two Pb sites, while S surfaces are uncapped.
Taken together, these results illustrate the ability of the Custom
Grid method to resolve heterogeneity in both s and
density when φ can be fixed.

The sedimentation results
for M4Ag44(p-MBA)30 are summarized
in Table 2. An integral
van Holde–Weischet distribution plot results in a vertical
line, clearly showing a single species (see Figure 4A). The observed s-value is consistent with
a monomer of the silver nanoparticle, and therefore the molar mass
can be constrained using the known molar mass available from the crystal
structure.31 As a consequence, both frictional
ratio and partial specific volume can be fitted in a custom grid.
This result is shown in Figure 4B. Again, a
single major peak is apparent, reflecting the monomeric structure
of M4Ag44(p-MBA)30. The observed
results clearly demonstrate the effects of hydration or solvation
on a nanoparticle, and in conjunction with molecular modeling using
the Zeno algorithm from the UltraScan-SOMO suite, permit estimates
of the level of hydration present under these conditions. The results
available from the Zeno simulation reflect only the unhydrated particle,
without any contributions from bound sodium ions or water molecules.
The difference in ν̅ therefore reflects the hydration
contribution. As expected, the ν̅ of the particle increases
once hydration is considered, since the density of water is significantly
less than the bulk density of the nanoparticle. Likewise, the hydrodynamic
radius Rh is increased for the hydrated
particle, allowing a first approximation to estimate the thickness
of the hydration shell (0.6 Å). Clearly, water is not uniformly
bound to the surface of the nanoparticle. Instead, any water and cation
binding most likely occurs near the hydrophilic carboxyl moieties
located at the exterior of the molecule, at the end of each benzoate
residue. Likewise, the increase in frictional ratio observed in the
experiment compared to the Zeno simulation for the anhydrous particle
is likely caused by the binding of water molecules at the ends of
the benzoate residues, replacing the overall globular shape of the
anhydrous particle with more extended spike-like shapes. The biggest
difference is seen in the reduction of the sedimentation coefficient,
which is caused by both an increase in ν̅, and an increase
in the frictional ratio. Together, these results illustrate the important
effects of hydration on the nanoparticle properties.

view of the Custom Grid–Monte Carlo analysis with a fixed molar

and a variable frictional ratio (x-axis) and variable
partial specific volume (y-axis). Two apparent contaminants
with insignificant partial concentrations are also found at f/f0 values of approximately
one and four. The color gradient reflects the partial concentration
of each species.

Like any other method,
the Custom Grid approach is subject to limitations
that must be understood. To apply the Custom Grid approach, which
at its base, is a two-dimensional evaluation method, one of the three
properties affecting hydrodynamic transport (frictional ratio, molar
mass, and partial specific volume) must be known a priori and remain
constant for all particles included in the evaluation. Like any other
sedimentation experiment, the quality of the result depends on the
signal strength of both sedimentation and diffusion of the solutes
under investigation. For example, if molecules are sedimenting too
fast, diffusion information may be limited, which will degrade the
results.

Conclusions
The Custom Grid function in UltraScan-III
provides a high resolution
method to characterize heterogeneity in two out of three hydrodynamic
parameters: molar mass, partial specific volume, and anisotropy. In
the case of hybrid nanoparticle systems such as inorganic CdSe or
PbS cores with an organic stabilizer ligand shell, anisotropies can
be determined with an independent method like TEM, and the heterogeneity
in size and density can be simultaneously determined using SV experiments.
From the results, detailed information about the size and density
of the organic ligand shell can be obtained. As shown in the case
of M4Ag44(p-MBA)30, where molar masses
are available from atomic structures or mass spectrometry, effects
of hydration on solvated nanoparticles can be determined, and hydration
shells can be quantified. The custom grid function in UltraScan-III
permits a full hydrodynamic characterization of nanoparticles by exploiting
information from other experiments as a constraint in the fitting
function. This provides access to their density, hydrodynamic size,
partial specific volume, anisotropy, hydration, and molar mass. It
was found that organic ligand stabilized CdSe QDs of core–shell
sizes between 10.61 and 20.15 Å have an average density between
2.51 and 2.95 g/mL, whereas those for 12.60 and 15.00 Å PbS QDs
are 2.91 and 3.38 g/mL, respectively. The hydrated silver nanoparticle
M4Ag44(p-MBA)30 was shown to have
a partial specific volume of 0.27 mL/g, and an anisotropy factor of
1.46. We have shown that AUC provides statistically meaningful measurements
of the hydrodynamic size and diffusion coefficient of nanocrystals
and also enables direct insight into the nature of the ligand shell
surrounding the inorganic core. The method presented here is suitable
for characterizing mixtures that present heterogeneities in any of
these parameters, as long as one of the parameters can be constrained
to a single value that is true for all particles in the mixture.
