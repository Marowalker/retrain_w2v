Carbon nanotube (CNT)-based microelectrodes
have been investigated
as alternatives to carbon-fiber microelectrodes for the detection
of neurotransmitters because they are sensitive, exhibit fast electron
transfer kinetics, and are more resistant to surface fouling. Wet
spinning CNTs into fibers using a coagulating polymer produces a thin,
uniform fiber that can be fabricated into an electrode. CNT fibers
formed in poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) have been used as microelectrodes
to detect dopamine, serotonin, and hydrogen peroxide. In this study,
we characterize microelectrodes with CNT fibers made in polyethylenimine
(PEI), which have much higher conductivity than PVA-CNT fibers. PEI-CNT
fibers have lower overpotentials and higher sensitivities than PVA-CNT
fiber microelectrodes, with a limit of detection of 5 nM for dopamine.
The currents for dopamine were adsorption controlled at PEI-CNT fiber
microelectrodes, independent of scan repetition frequency, and stable
for over 10 h. PEI-CNT fiber microelectrodes were resistant to surface
fouling by serotonin and the metabolite interferant 5-hydroxyindoleacetic
acid (5-HIAA). No change in sensitivity was observed for detection
of serotonin after 30 flow injection experiments or after 2 h in 5-HIAA
for PEI-CNT electrodes. The antifouling properties were maintained
in brain slices when serotonin was exogenously applied multiple times
or after bathing the slice in 5-HIAA. Thus, PEI-CNT fiber electrodes
could be useful for the in vivo monitoring of neurochemicals.

==== Body
Carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) were
identified in 19911 and have been used
extensively to enhance the sensitivity and electron transfer kinetics
of electrodes.2,3 Britto et. al developed the first
carbon nanotube paste electrode, which had perfect, Nernstian reversible
kinetics for dopamine detection (∼30 mV peak separation).4 The CNT-based electrode displayed faster electron
transfer kinetics than typical carbon electrodes because the sp2 hybridized CNT structure is highly conductive and the ends
of CNTs have reactive edge plane sites.5 CNTs are especially attractive for making smaller electrodes because
the high surface-area-to-volume ratio results in a large electroactive
surface area for the adsorption of biomolecules. Many different strategies
have been developed to modify microelectrode surfaces with CNTs. Dip-coating
carbon nanotubes onto carbon-fiber microelectrodes (CFMEs) results
in an increase in sensitivity, faster electron transfer kinetics,
and a resistance to serotonin fouling, but the CNTs can aggregate
on the surface.6,7 Polymer coatings, such as Nafion
or overoxidized polypyrrole, can be used to immobilize CNTs and increase
sensitivity for dopamine while repelling anionic interferants such
as ascorbic acid.8−10 The most sensitive CNT-modified CFMEs have aligned
CNT forests self-assembled onto the surface, suggesting that CNT alignment
is key.11 However, all of these methods
are difficult to fabricate reproducibly, and the electrochemical properties
of the carbon fiber core, which vary with different waveforms, can
affect the electrochemical properties.12 Therefore, an electrode material made only from CNTs could avoid
these issues.

Fibers made from CNTs would be an ideal microelectrode
material
because they could be directly fabricated into electrodes in a manner
similar to carbon fibers, rather than coating an existing electrode
with CNTs. CNT fibers grown via chemical vapor deposition and twisted
into yarns have faster electron transfer kinetics than CFMEs and have
been used to measure stimulated dopamine release in brain slices.13 The sensitivity at one type of CNT yarn is independent
of scan frequency, giving them enhanced ability to make fast measurements.14 The Poulin group developed a method of making
carbon nanotube fibers through polymer wet spinning.15 They separated carbon nanotube bundles in an aqueous surfactant
solution to overcome van der Waals forces of attraction and aggregation.
The suspended nanotubes were then pushed into a streaming solution
of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) which displaced the surfactant and formed
nanotube ribbons which subsequently collapsed in air into fibers.15 Wang’s group examined these PVA-CNT fibers
as electrodes for the detection of NADH, peroxide, and dopamine using
hydrodynamic voltammetry and amperometry; however, the concentrations
tested were much higher than physiological levels.16 PVA-CNT fiber electrodes have been used to codetect complex
mixtures of dopamine and ascorbic acid,8 electrocatalytically oxidize NADH,17,18 detect glucose
in enzymatic sensors,17 and reduce electrode
fouling from large concentrations of dopamine.19

Other polymer-CNT fibers have been developed but
not been tested
as microelectrode materials. Polymer-CNT fibers wet-spun with polyethylenimine
(PEI), for example, are 100 times more conductive than PVA-CNT fibers
because of the physisorption of the amine to the CNT wall.20 The amine intercalates into bundles of SWCNTs
and initiates a charge transfer. In this study, we compare the electrochemical
properties of PEI-CNT fiber microelectrodes to PVA-CNT fiber microelectrodes
and carbon-fiber microelectrodes. PEI-CNT fiber microelectrodes have
lower limits of detection and better electron transfer kinetics than
PVA-CNT fibers. Dopamine detection is adsorption controlled, and the
signal is stable for 10 h. The PEI-CNT fibers are resistant to fouling
by serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), a serotonin
metabolism product, which will make them useful for the detection
of neurotransmitters in vivo.

Methods and Materials
Chemicals and Materials
Dopamine was purchased from
Sigma (St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.). A 10 mM stock solution was prepared
in 0.1 M perchloric acid and diluted to 1.0 μM daily with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) (131.5 mM NaCl, 3.25 mM KCl, 1.2 mM CaCl2,
1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgCl2, and
2.0 mM Na2SO4 with the pH adjusted to 7.4) (all
from Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, New Jersey, U.S.A.). All aqueous
solutions were made with deionized water (EMD Millipore, Billerica,
MA, U.S.A.). Diethylenetriamine hardener was used as received
from Fisher Scientific.

Instrumentation
Fast-scan cyclic
voltammetry (FSCV)
was performed using a ChemClamp potentiostat (Dagan, Minneapolis,
MN, U.S.A.). Data were collected and analyzed with Tarheel CV software
(gift of Mark Wightman, UNC, Chapel Hill, NC, U.S.A.) using custom
data acquisition hardware previously described.21 A triangle waveform was applied to the electrode from a
holding potential of −0.4 to 1.3 V and back at a scan rate
of 400 V/sec and a frequency of 10 Hz, unless otherwise noted. A silver–silver
chloride wire was used as the reference electrode. Samples were tested
in a flow injection analysis system consisting of a six-port, stainless
steel HPLC loop injector mounted on a two-position air actuator (VICI
Valco Instruments, Co., Houston, TX, U.S.A.). Buffer and samples were
pumped through the flow cell at 2 mL/min using a syringe pump (Harvard
Apparatus, Holliston, MA, U.S.A.).

Scanning Electron Microscopy
Scanning electron microscope
(SEM) images were collected on a FEI Quanta 650 microscope with a
secondary electron detector using an accelerating voltage of 5 kV
and a working distance of 5.6 mm.

CNT Fiber Fabrication
Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) carbon
nanotube (CNT) fibers were prepared as previously described.15 HiPCo CNTs (0.4%, high pressure carbon monoxide,
Unidym, Sunnyvale, CA) were suspended in 1.2% aqueous solution of
sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (SDBS, Sigma) by sonicating
for 60 min in a tissue sonicator. The CNT suspension was pumped through
a 30 G syringe needle (flow rate 0.5 mL/min) into a 4% aqueous solution
of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (Aqua Solutions, Deer Park, TX, MW =
124 000–186 000). The PVA solution was revolved
using a custom built rotating stage. CNT ribbons were subsequently
purified and rinsed in water and then methanol, which washed away
the excess polymer. Ribbons collapsed into fibers upon being allowed
to dry in air and then were placed in the oven for 1 h at 180 °C.

Polyethylenimine (PEI) CNT fibers were formed as previously described.20 HiPCo CNTs (0.4%) were suspended in water with
SDBS (1.2%) and were pumped into a rotating solution of 40% PEI (branched,
MW = 50 000–100 000, MP Biomedicals, LLC, Santa
Ana, CA) in methanol. The CNT ribbons were subsequently purified in
methanol. CNT fibers were dried in air and then 180 °C for 1
h.

Electrode Construction
Carbon nanotube fiber microelectrodes
were made with epoxy insulation.22 Each
channel in a Teflon mold (channels 30–40 μm wide and
deep)22 was filled with Armstrong Resin
C7 and 0.8% Armstrong Activator A2 (Ellsworth Adhesives, Germantown,
WI, U.S.A.). A single carbon nanotube fiber or carbon fiber was manually
inserted into each channel, and the epoxy was allowed to cure for
3 h at 165 °C before the electrode was removed from the mold.
Silver epoxy (H20E, equal portions of Parts A and B, Epoxy Technology,
Billerica, MA, U.S.A.) was applied with to one end of the epoxied
carbon fiber and connected to a gold pin (0.035 in. × 0.249 in.,
Digikey, Thief River Falls, MN, U.S.A.) to connect to the potentiostat.
The silver epoxy was cured for 1 h at 150 °C. CNT fibers were
cut at the surface at an angle of 90° to form “disk-like”
electrodes. Cylindrical carbon-fiber microelectrodes were made by
cutting at 100 μm length to give equivalent surface areas.

Glass insulated cylindrical carbon-fiber microelectrodes (for serotonin
fouling experiments) and PEI-CNT fiber microelectrodes (for brain
slice experiments) were made by aspirating a single carbon fiber/CNT
fiber into a glass capillary (1.2 mm by 0.68 mm, A-M Systems, Inc.,
Carlsborg, WA, U.S.A.). The capillary was pulled to form two electrodes
on a vertical pipet puller (Narishige, model PE-21, Tokyo, Japan),
and the fiber cut to length. Glass electrodes were epoxied with Epon
828 resin and phenylenediamine hardener (Miller-Stephenson, Morton
Grove, IL, U.S.A.) and heated for 24 h at 150 °C. Glass-insulated
PEI-CNT fiber microelectrodes were polished at 45° for brain
slice studies.

All CNT fiber microelectrodes were equilibrated
by scanning with
the applied waveform for 1 h before testing with the exception of
electrodes tested using the serotonin waveform (0.2 to 1.0 to −0.1
to 0.2 at 1000 V/sec)23 or for stability
experiments (upper limit = 1.0 V) that were equilibrated with their
aforementioned waveforms for 10 min. The limit of detection (LOD)
was calculated using a S/N ratio of 3 from 1 μM measurements
for serotonin and 100 nM measurements for dopamine. Surface areas
were estimated by either integrating the current and multiplying by
time or using the background current at 0.25 V. These currents were
divided by specific capacitance times scan rate to produce surface
areas. Both methods gave similar areas. The specific capacitance value
used was 24 μF/cm2,24 a
standard capacitance for glassy carbon. Although this specific capacitance
might vary by fiber material (the range for carbon is typically 20–40
μF/cm2),24 it allows a
rough estimation of surface area.

Brain Slice Experiments
All animal experiments were
approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of
Virginia. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (250–350 g, Charles
River, Wilmington, MA) were housed in a vivarium and given food and
water ad libitum. Brain slice experiments were performed as previously
described.10 Rats were anesthetized with
isoflurane (1 mL/100 g rat weight), beheaded, and the brain removed.
A vibratome (LeicaVT1000S, Bannockburn, IL) was used to collect 400
μm slices of the caudate-putamen, which recovered in oxygenated
aCSF (95% oxygen, 5% CO2) for an hour before the experiment.
During the experiment, slices were perfused with aCSF maintained at
35–37 °C at a rate of 2 mL/min. The PEI-CNT electrode
was inserted 75 μm into the tissue.

For serotonin fouling
experiments, 25 μM serotonin was pressure ejected into brain
slices from a pulled glass pipet placed 20–30 μm from
the working electrode using a Parker Hannifin picospritzer (Picospritzer
III, Cleveland, OH). The ejection parameters were 20 psi for 50–100
ms. High concentrations of serotonin are needed in order to detect
serotonin at the electrode due to diffusion and rapid uptake. To test
for fouling, the same amount of serotonin was exogenously applied
every 2 min for 10 min (total of 5 ejections). Then, the effect of
5-HIAA fouling was tested in the same slice. The slice was perfused
with 10 μM 5-HIAA in oxygenated aCSF for 30 min, and serotonin
was exogenously applied at the end of the 30 min. The 5-HIAA was then
washed out with normal aCSF, and serotonin was exogenously applied
again. The peak oxidative currents for serotonin before, after 30
min of 5-HIAA perfusion, and after washout were compared. Statistics
were performed in GraphPad prism and considered significant at the
95% confidence level.

Results
Synthesis and Characterization
of PEI-CNT Fibers
Polyethylenimine
(PEI) CNT fibers were constructed by a wet spinning procedure, in
a manner similar to that of PVA-CNT fibers.20 SWCNTs were suspended in water using a charged surfactant, SDBS,
and sonication. PEI, similar to other amines, physisorbs to the sidewall
of single-wall carbon nanotubes and can facilitate electron transfer
by intercalating between adjacent CNT bundles.20 The conductivity of the fiber is expected to be increased
by 2 orders of magnitude when replacing PVA with PEI in polymer-CNT
fibers because of the electron donation from the amine group of PEI
to SWNT sidewalls.18

Scanning electron
microscope images show PEI-CNT fibers have diameters of 15 to 25 μm.
The diameter is dependent on the flow rate of the syringe pump and
the rotation speed of the stage and can be controlled by varying these
two parameters. Figure 1A shows the side of
a fiber. The surface of the fiber is primarily composed of SWCNTs
with distinct regions of PEI that were not fully removed during the
rinse. Fewer regions of polymer impurities are observed on the outside
of the CNT fiber walls for PEI-CNT fibers than for PVA-CNT fibers.15 Figure 1B shows an end
of a CNT fiber. The CNTs appear to be in thick bundles on the surface
and are coated in PEI polymer.

Comparison of PVA-CNT and
PEI-CNT Fiber Electrodes
As an initial comparison, the electrochemical
detection of 1 μM
dopamine was compared at PVA-CNT and PEI-CNT fiber disk microelectrodes.
Our lab and the Ewing lab have previously used PVA-CNT fiber microelectrodes
to detect dopamine using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry,19,22 and others have characterized their performance with other analytes
and electrochemical techniques.8,16−18 The potential was scanned from −0.4 to 1.3 V at a scan rate
of 400 V/s and a repetition frequency of 10 Hz. The example cyclic
voltammograms (CVs), Figure 2A, show that the
PEI-CNT fiber microelectrode has a higher oxidation current for dopamine
as well as a smaller potential separation between the peaks (ΔEp) than the PVA-CNT microelectrode. The background
CVs in Figure 2B show a larger background current
at the PEI-CNT fiber microelectrode compared to the PVA-CNT fiber
microelectrode, even though the microelectrodes had a similar diameter
(about 15 μm) and should have a similar surface area. The larger
capacitive current indicates that the PEI-CNT fiber microelectrodes
have a larger electroactive surface area or greater surface roughness
than PVA-CNT microelectrodes. On average, PEI-CNT fiber microelectrodes
have a 6-fold greater oxidation current for 1 μM dopamine compared
to PVA-CNT fiber microelectrodes (Figure 2C, n = 6 each, p < 0.0001, t-test). Figure 2D shows a significant difference
in ΔEp between the two CNT fibers
with the peak separation of PEI-CNT microelectrodes about 300 mV less
than PVA-CNT microelectrodes (n = 6 each, p < 0.0001, t-test). This suggests that
the electron transfer kinetics may be faster at PEI-CNT fiber microelectrodes,
and PVA may slow the kinetics. The increased ΔEp could also be caused by differing double-layer capacitances, uncompensated
resistance, or ohmic drop. However, because both the electrolyte and
the size of the electrodes are similar, ohmic drop is an unlikely
cause. Because the PEI-CNT fibers are reported to be 100-fold more
conductive than PVA-CNT fibers, faster charge transfer is expected
at PEI-CNT fibers.20

and PVA-CNT fiber microelectrodes. All electrodes
were scanned from −0.4 to 1.3 V and back at 400 V/s at 10 Hz.

(C) Average peak oxidative currents (nA) for 1 μM dopamine are
significantly different (n = 6 each, p < 0.0001, t-test, error bars SEM). (D) The ΔEP values of the electrodes are significantly
different (n = 6 each, p < 0.0001, t-test, error bars SEM).

In this study, we used untreated CNT fibers, but post treatments
have been developed for similar fibers. Acid treatment, oxidizing
with polyoxymetalate agents, or heating to high temperatures above
1000 K have been used to remove PVA from PVA-CNT fibers, as well as
to oxidize the surface and increase conductivity of the fiber.8,17,18 However, these procedures are
often tedious and lack reproducibility.18 At high temperatures, the carbon nanotube fibers become more conductive
as nongraphitic carbon is either removed or graphitized, but heat
treatment must be carried out in inert-atmosphere or under vacuum
to avoid excessive oxidation and combustion of the carbon in the fiber.25 Although heat treatment may further improve
PEI-CNT microelectrodes, the FSCV data show that as-fabricated PEI-CNT
fibers are suitable for dopamine detection, and heat treatment is
not necessary.20 Thus, untreated PEI-CNT
fiber microelectrodes are simple to use and have enhanced performance
for dopamine detection compared to untreated PVA-CNT fibers.

Characterization
of Dopamine Detection at PEI-CNT Fiber Microelectrodes
To
characterize the properties of PEI-CNT fiber microelectrodes,
the scan rate was varied from 100 to 1000 V/s. Figure 3A shows that current for 1 μM dopamine increases linearly
with respect to scan rate. This indicates that dopamine oxidation
at PEI-CNT microelectrodes is an adsorption controlled process, similar
to dopamine oxidation at CFMEs, and is likely to be dependent upon
oxide groups at the surface of the microelectrode.26

Figure 3 Adsorption Studies (A) Effect of scan rate. A linear relationship
was observed between scan rate and peak oxidative current for 1 μM
dopamine denoting adsorption control (n = 3, R2 = 0.999). (B) Concentration Study. Dopamine
concentrations were varied from 100 nM to 100 μM (n = 4). (C) Dopamine surface coverage is linear with concentration
up to 5 μM (R2 = 0.997). All error
bars are SEM.

PEI-CNT fiber electrodes
were used to detect different concentrations
from 100 nM to 100 μM dopamine (Figure 3B). The estimated surface area is 3.8 × 10–5 cm2 for PEI-CNT fibers, which is about 10-fold greater
than the geometrical surface area calculated for a disk of 10 μm
radius (3 × 10–6 cm2). The larger
area than just a disk was expected, as the end may fray upon cutting,
and the surface is nanostructured. Normalizing each electrode to the
electrochemically estimated surface area, a plot of surface coverage
versus concentration reveals that the surface coverage plateaus about
40 pmol/cm2, which is about the same order of magnitude
as previous studies of carbon fiber microelectrodes.26 At higher concentrations, there are contributions from
both diffusion and adsorption, so the plot will not completely plateau.
The surface coverage is linear up to 5 μM dopamine (Figure 3C).

The LOD for PEI-CNT microelectrodes was
estimated from the 100
nM dopamine CVs and was 4.7 ± 0.2 nM. PEI and PVA CNT fiber microelectrodes
can be easily compared because they are formed from the same carbon
source, HiPCO carbon nanotubes, and the different coagulating polymer
solution has no effect on the size and diameter of each individual
CNT fiber.15 PVA-CNT fiber microelectrodes
have a limit of detection of 53 ± 5 nM (n =
6), which is an order of magnitude higher than PEI-CNT fibers. The
LOD for epoxy-insulated, cylindrical CFMEs was found to be 24 nM in
our previous work.22 The surface area for
the CFMEs in that study was 4.3 × 10–5 cm2, similar to surface area of 3.8 × 10–5 cm2 for PEI-CNT fibers because cylindrical carbon fiber
microelectrodes were used. Thus, the LODs for PEI-CNT fibers are lower
than CFMEs even though the areas are similar.

Microelectrodes
are typically used in vivo for hours at a time
to measure neurotransmission in behavioral or pharmacological experiments.27−29 Therefore, electrodes must have a stable electrochemical response
for several hours. The stability of PEI-CNT fiber microelectrodes
was investigated by continuously applying the potential waveform to
the microelectrode for an extended period of time and injecting a
bolus of dopamine every 2 h. Over a 10 h period, there was no significant
change in peak oxidative current at PEI-CNT fiber microelectrodes
with a potential waveform of −0.4 to 1.0 V at a scan rate of
400 V/s, as seen in Figure 4A. Both the sensitivity
and the stability of PEI-CNT microelectrodes indicate that these microelectrodes
are suitable for in vivo experimentation.

Figure 4 Stability, switching
potential, and frequency studies. (A) The
stability experiment was performed by testing the response of a PEI-CNT
to 1 μM dopamine every 2 h for 10 h. There was no change in
sensitivity over 10 h. The electrodes were scanned from −0.4
to 1.0 V at 400 V/sec at 10 Hz. Error bars are SEM (n = 3). (B) The switching potential was varied from 1.0 to 1.5 V,
and the response to 1 μM dopamine was measured. Each waveform
was applied for 10 min before dopamine was measured. Overoxidation
occurs at higher switching potentials, which increases sensitivity
toward dopamine. Error bars are SEM (n = 6). (C)
The peak oxidative current does not change upon increasing the wave
application frequency from 10 to 100 Hz, R2 = 0.0. Inset: cyclic voltammograms of 1 μM dopamine for a
PEI-CNT fiber electrode at 10 and 90 Hz.

To optimize dopamine detection, the effect of increasing
the switching
potential was tested. Large positive potentials can cause oxidation
of the surface carbons and can modify the electrochemical properties
of carbon electrodes.30,31 At CFMEs, overoxidation of the
electrode surface occurs past 1.3 V, where carbon is functionalized
with electron-rich oxide groups, resulting in an increase in the sensitivity
toward dopamine.30 Higher switching potentials
can also break carbon–carbon bonds, which alters surface roughness
and increases adsorption sites for dopamine.30,31 Figure 4B shows that the measured oxidation
current at PEI-CNT microelectrodes increases with increased switching
potentials, and potentials of 1.2 V and below result in lower currents.
Although larger peak currents are observed at switching potentials
of 1.4 and 1.5 V, the signal-to-noise ratio decreased at potentials
above 1.3 V. At higher switching potentials, water oxidation likely
causes an unstable background, and background subtraction errors result
in a greater increase in noise than in signal. Thus, the overoxidation
behavior of PEI-CNT fibers is similar to carbon fibers, and the optimal
switching potential for improved sensitivity is 1.3 V. A 1.3 V switching
potential was chosen for most experiments because it provided some
surface activation and was away from the potential for water oxidation.

The effect of scan repetition frequency was also tested. At PEI-CNT
fiber microelectrodes, the oxidation current for dopamine is independent
of scan repetition frequency from 10 to 100 Hz (Figure 4C). In contrast, CFMEs lose about 80% of their signal when
the repetition frequency is 90 Hz compared to 10 Hz.26 CNT yarn microelectrodes also have the same frequency-independent
current, which was attributed to different rates of dopamine and dopamine o-quinone desorption at the CNT yarn microelectrodes.14 Future studies could examine adsorption and
desorption properties for PEI-CNT fibers and compare them to CNT yarns,
but these experiments suggest PEI-CNT fiber microelectrodes could
be useful for detection of dopamine with fast repetition rates.

Characterization of Serotonin Detection at PEI-CNT Fiber Microelectrodes
Serotonin is an important electroactive indolamine neurotransmitter
in the brain that is important for neurological disorders such as
anxiety and depression.32 The serotonin
oxidation peak at CFMEs is typically around 0.6 V with FSCV, and the
reduction peak is around 0 V. With the waveform scanning from −0.4
to 1.3 V and back with a scan rate of 400 V/s, PEI-CNT fiber electrodes
were more sensitive for serotonin than CFMEs, with a limit of detection
of 15 ± 2 nM compared to 24 ± 2 nM (p <
0.05, t-test, n = 3).

With
the standard FSCV waveform, oxidative products of serotonin can passivate
the CFME surface and block serotonin adsorption sites, resulting in
serotonin fouling of the CFME surface.23 Alternative waveforms exist to reduce serotonin fouling; however,
these waveforms do not detect a reduction potential for dopamine and,
thus, cannot codetect both dopamine and serotonin.6 To determine if PEI-CNT microelectrodes are fouled by serotonin
in a manner similar to that of CFMEs, 25 consecutive flow injection
experiments of serotonin were run using the same waveform we used
for dopamine analysis, −0.4 to 1.3 V and back at 400 V/s. In
each experiment, the electrode was exposed to a flowing 5 s bolus
of 1 μM serotonin, followed by 10 s of flowing buffer, and then
a subsequent serotonin injection was performed. Figure 5A compares oxidative currents for serotonin, normalized to
the first injection, at CFMEs and PEI-CNT microelectrodes. Over the
25 serotonin injections, the oxidation current of serotonin decreased
by 50% at CFMEs, indicating passivation of the electrode surface.
In contrast, the oxidation current at PEI-CNT microelectrodes remained
at 100% throughout the experiment, demonstrating there is no signal
decrease due to serotonin fouling. There is very little change in
the serotonin CV between the first and last injection at PEI-CNT microelectrodes
(Figure 5B), as opposed to CFMEs where there
is a greater than 50% decrease (Figure 5C).

Figure 5 Serotonin
fouling in vitro. (A) Serotonin solution (1 μM)
was injected for 5 s every 15 s for 25 injections. The electrodes
were scanned from −0.4 to 1.3 V at 400 V/sec at 10 Hz. There
was no decrease in current for serotonin for PEI CNT fiber electrodes
(red) as opposed to the 50% decrease for CFMEs (black). Both CFMEs
and PEI CNT fibers were normalized to the first electrode to account
for electrode to electrode differences. Error bars are SEM (n = 3). (B) Example cyclic voltammograms of 1 μM serotonin

black) and 25th injection (dashed orange), approximately 6.25 min
apart. Serotonin fouling does not occur at the surface of the PEI-CNT
fiber electrode. (C) Example cyclic voltammograms of 1 μM serotonin
for CFMEs for the 1st and 25th injection, indicating serotonin fouling
does occur at the surface of the CFME.

Characterization of 5-HIAA Fouling at PEI-CNT Fiber Microelectrodes
A recent study found that a metabolite of serotonin, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic
acid (5-HIAA), is the main cause of fouling at the CFME surface during
in vivo serotonin detection.33 5-HIAA fouling
is similar to serotonin fouling because it also blocks serotonin adsorption
sites on the surface of the electrode and results in decreased sensitivity.
Physiological concentrations of 5-HIAA are approximately 10 times
greater than serotonin, and the fouling of 5-HIAA occurs even with
the waveforms developed specifically to reduce serotonin fouling.23 Physical or electrochemical deposition of Nafion
coatings can be used to repel the negatively charged 5-HIAA, but the
electrode preparation methods are time-consuming, and the thickness
of the Nafion layer is difficult to control reproducibly.33 Because both polymer coatings and electrochemical
pretreatments are known to slow the time response of electrodes, it
is advantageous to avoid them if possible.33

The effect of 5-HIAA fouling was tested at PEI-CNT fiber microelectrodes
by comparing the response to 1 μM serotonin before and after
the microelectrode was bathed in 10 μM 5-HIAA for 2 h while
the serotonin waveform was applied.23 At
the PEI-CNT microelectrode, there was almost no change in oxidation
or reduction current for serotonin before and after 5-HIAA immersion
(Figure 6A). However, for CFMEs, both the oxidation
and reduction peaks of serotonin are distorted and barely visible
after 2 h in 5-HIAA (Figure 6B). The serotonin
oxidation peak is not significantly different for PEI-CNT fiber microelectrodes
(n = 4, p = .6270, t-test) after 5-HIAA. For CFMEs, the signal decreases 95% after 5-HIAA
(Figure 6C, n = 4, p < 0.0001, t-test).

One micromolar serotonin was detected
at a PEI-CNT fiber electrode before and 2 h after it was bathed in
10 μM 5-HIAA while the waveform was applied. The applied waveform
was the serotonin waveform (0.2 to 1.0 to −0.1 to 0.2 at 1000
V/sec). (A) The CVs are similar before and after 5-HIAA at PEI-CNT
microelectrodes. (B) For CFMEs, after 2 h in 10 μM 5-HIAA, the
oxidation peak of serotonin is no longer visible. (C) Bar graphs depicting
the change in peak oxidative current for serotonin before and after
exposure to 10 μM 5-HIAA for 2 h. The decrease in peak oxidative
current is significant for CFMEs (n = 4, p < 0.0001, t-test, error bars SEM),
while it is not significantly different for PEI-CNT fiber microelectrodes
(n = 4, p = 0.6270, t-test, error bars SEM).

The mechanism of the resistance to serotonin fouling to PEI-CNT
fiber electrodes is not entirely understood. Not all CNT-based electrodes
are antifouling for serotonin, and the extent of fouling is dependent
on the applied waveform.34 The Ewing group
studied the fouling by large concentrations of dopamine at PVA-CNT
fiber microelectrodes and found CNTs offer resistance to the first
phase of fouling, the growth of the insulating layer from the polymerization
products.19 Resistance to fouling at CNT
ends is often attributed to the higher density of edge plane sites.
Indeed, some studies of edge-plane pyrolytic graphite electrodes have
found that they have similar antifouling properties to CNT-based electrodes.35 The CNT ends in an aligned PEI-CNT fiber might
contain more edge plane sites that reduce fouling. Moreover, the mechanism
of adsorption of serotonin or 5-HIAA products to the surface of the
PEI-CNT fiber could differ from that of adsorption to a CFME. Studies
of thin carbon films have found that adding oxide groups while maintaining
a high sp2 conjugation also helps with resistance to serotonin
fouling.36 Thus, electrochemical pretreatments
such as extending the switching potential, that add oxide groups without
significantly reducing the sp2 hybridization, may also
help with antifouling properties of PEI-CNT electrodes. Future studies
are needed to tease out this complex mechanism of the antifouling
properties of CNT fibers.

Antifouling Properties Are Maintained in
a Brain Slice Environment
To test whether PEI-CNT fiber microelectrodes
maintained antifouling
properties in tissue, repeated applications of exogenous serotonin
were examined in rat brain slices of the caudate putamen. Serotonin
(25 μM) was ejected 20–30 μm away from the electrode
because large concentrations are needed due to diffusion and rapid
uptake. Serotonin was puffed on every 2 min for 10 min (five total
ejections). Figure 7A shows cyclic voltammograms
of serotonin comparing ejection 1 (black trace) to ejection 5 (red
dashed trace) and no change in peak shape or current is shown. On
average, current for serotonin is not significantly dependent on ejection
number in a brain slice (Figure 7B, repeated
measures one-way ANOVA, p = 0.2086, n = 6). Likewise, no decrease in current for exogenous serotonin was
observed upon bathing the slice in 10 μM 5-HIAA for 30 min.
Figure 7C shows an example cyclic voltammogram
for serotonin exogenously applied before the addition of 5-HIAA (black
trace), after 30 min of 5-HIAA perfusion (red trace), and after the
5-HIAA was washed out (blue trace). The peak oxidative serotonin current
did not significantly change in the presence of 5-HIAA or after 5-HIAA
washout (Figure 7D, repeated measures one-way
ANOVA, p = 0.4604, n = 6, error
bars SEM). This experiment provides proof of principle that the antifouling
properties of PEI-CNT fiber microelectrodes are maintained in tissue.

Figure 7 PEI-CNT
fiber microelectrodes maintain antifouling properties in
brain slices. (A,B) Serotonin (25 μM) was exogenously applied
near a PEI-CNT fiber electrode in a brain slices every 2 min for 10
min. (A) The black trace shows the initial serotonin CV, and the dashed
red trace shows the fifth serotonin CV. The CVs are similar. (B) Serotonin
current does not significantly change with ejection number (repeated
measures one-way ANOVA, p = 0.21, n = 6, error bars SEM). (C,D) Exogenous serotonin was applied, the
slice bathed in 10 μM 5-HIAA and serotonin applied again after
30 min, and then the 5-HIAA was washed out and exogenous serotonin
applied again. (C) Serotonin CVs before (black trace), after 30 min
perfusion of 5-HIAA (red trace), and after 5-HIAA washout (blue trace)
are similar. (D) The peak serotonin oxidative current did not significantly
change in the presence of 5-HIAA (repeated measures one-way ANOVA, p = 0.46, n = 6, error bars SEM).

One primary advantage of PEI-CNT
fiber microelectrodes is that
they do not become passivated by either 5-HT or 5-HIAA, even in tissue.
Thus, PEI-CNT fiber microelectrodes could be used in vivo for detection
of serotonin without any modification, an advantage over carbon-fiber
microelectrodes that require Nafion coating. With PEI-CNT fiber microelectrodes,
the dopamine waveform can be used for serotonin detection without
fouling, which is not possible at CFMEs.33 The advantage of using the dopamine waveform is that dopamine and
serotonin can both be detected by using their reduction peaks, which
is not possible with the serotonin waveform because it does not show
the reduction peak of dopamine. Co-detection of a mixture of both
2 μM dopamine and 2 μM serotonin is shown in Figure S1. The two molecules have an oxidation
peak at the same potential, but they can be differentiated by their
reduction peak. The results are similar to CFMEs that are dip coated
in CNTs.6 Combined with principal components
analysis to analyze the shapes,37 PEI-CNT
microelectrodes could be explored in the future for codetection of
dopamine and serotonin.

Conclusion
PEI-CNT fiber microelectrodes
provide attractive properties for
neurotransmitter detection: high sensitivity and resistance to fouling.
The PEI-CNT fiber microelectrodes have improved electrochemical properties
compared to PVA-CNT fiber microelectrodes, as well as lower limits
of detection than traditional CFMEs. Dopamine detection is adsorption
controlled at PEI-CNT fiber microelectrodes, and the electrodes have
a linear range comparable to CFMEs. In contrast to CFMEs, PEI-CNT
fibers can be used with high scan repetition frequencies without any
loss of dopamine signal. In addition, PEI-CNT fiber microelectrodes
are stable over long periods of measurement and are resistant to surface
fouling by both serotonin and 5-HIAA in brain slices. Thus, PEI-CNT
fiber microelectrodes have increased sensitivity for dopamine and
serotonin and resistance to fouling with serotonin that would be beneficial
for use as future in vivo neurotransmitter sensors.
