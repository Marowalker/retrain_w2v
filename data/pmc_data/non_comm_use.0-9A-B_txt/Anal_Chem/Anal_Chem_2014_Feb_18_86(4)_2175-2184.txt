Recent advances in mass spectrometry
have allowed for unprecedented
characterization of human metabolism and its contribution to disease.
Despite these advances, limitations in metabolomics technology remain.
Here, we describe a metabolomics strategy that consolidates several
recent improvements in mass spectrometry technology. The platform
involves a high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled to faster
scanning speeds, allowing for polarity switching and improved ion
optics resulting in enhanced sensitivity. When coupled to HILIC chromatography,
we are able to quantify over 339 metabolites from an extract of HCT8
cells with a linear range of over 4 orders of magnitude in a single
chromatographic run. These metabolites include diverse chemical classes
ranging from amino acids to polar lipids. In addition, we also detect
over 3000 additional potential metabolites present in mammalian cells.
We applied this platform to characterize the metabolome of eight colorectal
cancer cell lines and observed both commonalities and heterogeneities
across their metabolic profiles when cells are grown in identical
conditions. Together these results demonstrate that simultaneous profiling
and quantitation of the human metabolome is feasible.

Advances
in mass spectrometry
have allowed for the simultaneous measurement and quantitation of
many metabolites in defined biological conditions.1−4 These advances in metabolomics
have led to newfound insights into the role of metabolism in health
and disease. For example, tumor cells are known to have dramatic alterations
in the ability to uptake and metabolize nutrients, resulting in gross
rewiring of the metabolic network.5−10 Mass spectrometry has played an instrumental role in defining these
differences that are now being investigated for cancer treatment and
prevention.

These metabolomic technologies have involved high-performance
liquid
chromatography (HPLC) coupled to an electrospray ion (ESI) source
and mass analyzer. Typically, the platforms have used a triple quadrupole
mass analyzer and involve targeting a series of metabolites by monitoring
the transitions from the selected precursor ion to a specific fragmentation
ion of the precursor ion (multiple reaction monitoring, MRM).11,12 Alternatively, instruments utilizing high-resolution mass spectrometry
(HRMS) tend to have higher duty cycle times, leading to difficulties
in quantitation.13−15 An instrument that consolidates these capabilities
could allow for untargeted metabolite profiling with sufficient scan
speeds for quantitative, targeted analysis. Such an advance might
overcome many of the limitations in both approaches. Scan speeds have
also improved such that polarity switching is obtainable on these
instruments, allowing for approximately a 2-fold expansion of the
number of metabolites that can be detected during single chromatographic
runs.16−20

In light of these advances, the extent of capability that
this
current metabolomics technology could allow remains poorly characterized.
We developed a HRMS-based metabolomics platform using HPLC coupled
to a heated ESI source (HESI), a quadrupole mass filter, a curved
ion trap (C-trap), and Fourier transform-based OrbitrapTM mass analyzer.
This instrument, termed the Q-Exactive MS (QE-MS), has demonstrated
many superior capabilities for quantitative and qualitative proteomics
applications,21−24 but its general utility for metabolomics applications has, to our
knowledge, yet to be explored. We next considered an extensive assessment
of its performance in both targeted and nontargeted applications by
evaluating its ability to detect and quantify metabolomics across
a set of colorectal cancer cell lines.

Experimental Section
Materials
All cell lines were provided as a generous
gift from Dr. Lewis Cantley’s laboratory. RPMI 1640 medium
was purchased from Cellgro. Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), penicillin,
and streptomycin were purchased from Hyclone Laboratories. Dialyzed
FBS was obtained from Life Technologies. Optima-grade ammonium acetate,
ammonium hydroxide, acetonitrile, methanol, and water were purchased
from Fisher Scientific.

Cell Culture
All cell lines were
first cultured in
10 cm dishes with full growth medium, which contains RPMI 1640, 10%
FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. Cells
were grown in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2.

Mass Spectrometry
The QE-MS is equipped with a HESI
probe, and the relevant parameters are as listed: heater temperature,
120 °C; sheath gas, 30; auxiliary gas, 10; sweep gas, 3; spray
voltage, 3.6 kV for the positive mode and 2.5 kV for the negative
mode. Capillary temperature was set at 320 °C, and S-lens was
55. A full scan range from 60 to 900 (m/z) was used. The resolution was set at 70000. The maximum injection
time (max IT) was 200 ms with typical injection times around 50 ms.
These settings resulted in a duty cycle of around 550 ms to carry
out scans in both the positive and negative modes. Automated gain
control (AGC) was targeted at 3 × 106 ions. For MS/MS,
the isolation width of the precursor was set at 2.5, HCD collision
energy was 35%, and max IT is 100 ms. The resolution and AGC were
35000 and 200000, respectively. Full scan with resolution at 35000
and IT of 100 ms) was run together with MS/MS. Customized mass calibration
was performed before any sample analysis.

High-Performance Liquid
Chromatography
The HPLC (Ultimate
3000 UHPLC) is coupled to QE-MS (Thermo Scientific) for metabolite
separation and detection. An Xbridge amide column (100 × 2.1
mm i.d., 3.5 μm; Waters) is employed for compound separation
at room temperature. The mobile phase A is 20 mM ammonium acetate
and 15 mM ammonium hydroxide in water with 3% acetonitrile, pH 9.0,
and mobile phase B is acetonitrile. The linear gradient used is as
follows: 0 min, 85% B; 1.5 min, 85% B, 5.5 min, 35% B; 10 min, 35%
B, 10.5 min, 35% B, 14.5 min, 35% B, 15 min, 85% B, and 20 min, 85%
B. The flow rate was 0.15 mL/min from 0 to 10 min and 15 to 20 min
and 0.3 mL/min from 10.5 to 14.5 min.

Sample Preparation for
Dynamic Range Studies
HCT 8
cells were grown in three 10 cm dishes with full growth medium. When
the cells reach 80% confluence, the media were quickly removed, and
the dish was placed on top of dry ice. Three milliliters of extraction
solvent was immediately added (80% methanol/water), and the dishes
were then transferred to the −80 °C freezer. The dishes
were left for 15 min, and then cells were scraped into extraction
solvent on dry ice. The entirety of the solution was transferred to
two 1.7 mL eppendorf tubes and centrifuged with the speed of 20000g for 10 min at 4 °C. Here, cell metabolite extracts
were prepared from three separate dishes to make three biological
replicates. The supernatant was then transferred to new eppendorf
tubes and dried in a SpeedVac. The samples can also be dried under
nitrogen gas. After drying, one tube of each sample was stored in
the −80 °C freezer as a backup, while the other one was
reconstituted into 20 μL of water (LC–MS grade, Fisher
Scientific). A serial dilution of triplicate samples from 10 cm Petri
dish was done 5 times with a dilution factor of 6, ending up with
6 different concentrations of samples. These samples represent the
amount of metabolites extracted from 107, 1.67 × 106, 2.78 × 105, 4.63 × 104,
7.72 × 103, and 1.29 × 103 of cells,
respectively. Since each concentration of sample was prepared in triplicate,
a total of 18 samples are analyzed in LC-QE-MS.

Metabolite
Extraction from Colorectal Cancer Cell Lines
Eight colorectal
cancer cell lines were seeded in 6-well plates at
the density of 2 × 105 to 5 × 105 per
well for 24 h. Metabolites were extracted as described above, except
that 1 mL of extraction solvent was used, instead of 3 mL. Each sample
was dissolved into 20 μL of water, and 5 μL was injected
to LC-QE-MS. The sequence of sample injections was randomized so that
the fluctuation in LC-QE-MS performance was evenly distributed across
each sample.

Peak Extraction
Raw data collected
from the LC-QE-MS
were processed on Thermo Scientific, Sieve 2.0. Peak alignment and
detection were performed according to manufacturer protocols. For
a targeted metabolomics analysis, a frameseed including 194 metabolites
was used for targeted metabolites analysis with data collected in
positive mode, while a frame seed of 262 metabolites was used for
negative mode, where m/z width is
set at 10 ppm. For an untargeted metabolomics analysis, the following
parameter values were used to extract untargeted components (pairs
of m/z and R.T.): background signal-to-noise
ratio, 3; minimum ion count, 1 × 105; minimum scans
across the peak, 5; m/z step, 10
ppm.

Statistical Analysis
To assess the linear range, targeted
metabolite data was filtered as follows: for each metabolite, if the
lowest signal in all of the samples is less than 103 and
meanwhile the highest signal is less than 104, then this
metabolite is considered as below the detection limit; if the lowest
signal is less than 103 but the highest signal is more
than 104 then replace the low signal with 103. Calculations were performed in R computing language (www.r-project.org). The r2 distribution was represented
as a histogram using GraphPad 6.0.

Quantile normalization, unsupervised
hierarchical clustering (Pearson, Spearman linkages), and heat map
generation were carried out with the software Gene-e (Broad institute, http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/GENE-E/index.html). The maximum fold change (Maxchange) calculation was carried out
in the software package R.

Results
Overview
We first developed a strategy that focuses
on measuring polar metabolites (Figure 1, panels
A and B). A cold methanol extraction method was used to minimize the
perturbation of metabolism in cultured cells.25,26 LC-HRMS with positive and negative mode switching was employed to
expand on the number of metabolites that can be accessed. To achieve
high throughput, we considered a chromatography run of 20 min. Both
untargeted and targeted metabolomics studies were carried out with
the data obtained from the workflow in Figure 1A. Figure 2A describes LC–MS data processing
procedures. For the untargeted analysis, neither pre-existing knowledge
of metabolites to be measured nor heavy isotope labeled standards
(Stds) are required. After a component extraction, the data are further
filtered by using multiple criteria, including the coefficient of
variation (CV) within replicate samples and the total MS intensity
(integrated peak area). Finally, components of interest are selected
for a database search based on the detected mass of the selected component
with a 10 ppm mass tolerance. For targeted metabolomics, the corresponding
mass to charge ratio (m/z) and retention
time (R.T.) are used for peak extraction.

Figure 1 Overview of polar metabolite
analysis platform. (A) The platform
for polar metabolomics using LC-QE-MS. In positive mode, positively
charged ions (red dots) are sent to S-lens (ion focusing), a quadrupole
(low-resolution mass filter), C-trap (ions accumulate here until the
targeted number of ions is reached), and finally Orbitrap high-resolution
(HR) mass analyzer, where mass to charge ratio (m/z) of each ion and corresponding retention time
(R.T.) are recorded. Once positive ions are sent to the Orbitrap from
C-trap, the electronic field polarity is reversed, and only negatively
charged ions (blue dots) are delivered from the HESI probe. (B) The
duty cycle time when instrument is operated in pos/neg switch full
scan mode with resolution of 70000. The typical duty cycle is between
512 and 912 ms, depending on the C-trap injection time (IT).

A comprehensive list of metabolites
with theoretical m/z (both in positive
and negative mode) was generated
based on a recent study.27 This list was
used to generate extracted ion chromatography (EIC) from full scan
data. A scoring system was established to evaluate confidence in the
metabolite assignments (Figure 2B). A metabolite
peak will gain a positive score under any of the following situations:
(1) Ions are detected in more than one concentration of sample, (2)
a corresponding 13C peak is detected when a labeled extract
is used, (3) there exists a unique single peak in the EIC channel
and this peak does not contain any known isomers, or if there are
known isomers, there are characteristic MS/MS fragments to distinguish
the isomers, and (4) authentic standards are injected to confirm the
assignment. On the basis of these criteria, we generated a list of
262 metabolites in negative mode and 194 in positive mode, and the
following targeted metabolomics data processing was based on this
list.

MS/MS Identification of Isomers
An example of an MS/MS-based
resolution of isomers is shown in Figure 3.
Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and deoxyguanosine diphosphate (dGDP)
are not distinguishable in full scan mode (Figure 3A), since the two molecules have exactly the same elemental
composition and, as a result, the same m/z. MS/MS fragmentation by HCD was done at a resolution of
35000. MS/MS peak (Figure 3B) and EIC from
full scan (Figure 3A) have the same retention
time. At this resolution, MS/MS spectrum has decent intensity and,
meanwhile, a very small mass error (1.2 ppm for fragment with m/z = 136.06161), as shown in Figure 3 (panels B and C). In the MS/MS spectrum (Figure 3C), the fragment of m/z = 348.06980 is generated from the cleavage of a phosphate group,
which is not characteristic, while the fragment of m/z = 136.06161 is corresponding to adenine, which
can only be generated from ADP by cleavage of the ribose group. There
is no m/z = 152.05669 (guanine from
dGDP) detected, so the peak at 8.03 min is assigned as ADP. We further
confirmed this assignment by comparison of ADP and dGDP in a QT of
MS/MS spectrum from the Massbank database.28

spectrum. The exact mass of fragment ion is shown below the corresponding
fragment ion.

Dynamic Range of Metabolite
Quantitation
Having developed
a combined metabolomics technology, we next sought to evaluate its
quantitative abilities. Metabolites were extracted from 107 cells and first diluted 6-fold and then followed by serial dilution
resulting in extracts of differing concentrations. The total ion chromatography
(TIC) from these 6 concentrations are shown in Figure 4 (panels A and B) (here, the Y axis is normalized by the highest
intensity in the sample). Figure 4C demonstrates
the MS intensity range across targeted metabolites. Figure 4D demonstrates a strong correlation between CV within
triplicate samples and the corresponding MS intensity. As expected,
the higher the MS intensity, the lower the measured CV, since a lower
signal tends to have more interference from ions with very close m/z values. For metabolites with MS intensities
higher than 1 × 106, the CV is within 7.8% (at 75th
percentile), while for MS intensities less than 1 × 103, CV varies to a larger extent (132.8% at the 75th percentile). Therefore,
we defined an MS intensity of 1 × 103 as the noise
level, and in Figure 4E, data are processed
further by imputing intensities lower than 1 × 103 with a value of 1 × 103, as described in the methods
section. The linear regression of MS intensity (the integrated peak
area within the defined retention time window of every m/z) and concentrations is shown in 4E. The TIC increases as the concentration of injected metabolites
increases, and meanwhile a linear regression analysis of 5 concentrations
(excluding the highest saturated concentration) shows that more than
86% of metabolites detected have r2 values
larger than 0.85, implying that over 4 orders of magnitude, the relative
mass intensity can accurately reflect metabolite relative levels.
The low r2 in the remaining 14% of metabolites
was either because they were not detected at low sample concentration
or because they had a poor linear MS response. At a number of 107 cells, signals tended to decrease due to strong ion suppression
from the biological matrix effect, and also the retention times shift
due to overloading of the analyte on the LC column.

Metabolic Profiling of
Colorectal Cancer Cell Lines
The method described and discussed
in Figures 1 and 2 was
then applied to study the metabolite
profiles in eight colorectal cancer cell lines: SW620, SW480, HCT8,
HT29, HCT116, NCI-H508, SW48, and SW948. A list of 375 measured targeted
ions is included in Table 1 of the Supporting
Information. Each cell line was cultured in the same medium
to avoid confounding effects on metabolism due to differences in nutrient
availability. Each cell line was observed to have a different, albeit
small, intensity range (Figure 5A), which can
be removed with quantile normalization (Figure 5B). An inspection of metabolite intensities was carried out using
different clustering algorithms (Figure 5,
panels C, D, E, and F). For each representation, the columns represent
different metabolites, while the rows represent eight cell lines in
triplicate. The effect of quantile normalization becomes apparent
when clustering is carried out using linkages corresponding to Pearson
correlations. As shown in Figure 5 (panels
C and D), SW620, HT29, HCT116, NCI-H508, and SW48 are clustered using
raw intensity values, while SW620 is separated from other cell lines
when raw intensity is quantile normalized. However, when Spearman
correlations are used for the linkages, quantile normalization makes
little difference, as expected (Figure 5, panels
E and F).

The color code bar is applicable to each of (C–F).

To compare the metabolite profiling variations
in different cell
lines, the mean values of every three replicates are used to calculate
CV and Maxchange (N = 8). Here Maxchange is defined
as the ratio of highest to lowest mean intensity observed across the
cell line panel. As demonstrated in Figure 6 (panels A and B), 270 out of 375 metabolites have CVs less than
40%, and this number increases to 290 if the quantile normalized values
are used. There are 27 out of 375 metabolites with CVs larger than
100% if working with raw values, while this number decreases to 24
if data is quantile normalized. When a Maxchange value is calculated
(Figure 6, panels C and D), there are 190 metabolites
with Maxchange ≤ 2. After quantile normalization, this number
increases to 222. For metabolites with Maxchange ≥ 32, the
number slightly increases from 20 to 22 with quantile normalization.

metabolites. (D) Maxchange distribution as in (C) but with quantile

lines.

CV (within triplicates) and MS
intensity distributions of untargeted
components extracted from the cell line SW620 data based on the parameters
listed in the method section are plotted in Figure 7 (panels A and B). The number of components (with MS intensity
higher than 104) extracted at different cutoff values is
plotted in Figure 7C. Here, the 104 MS intensity cutoff value is used to avoid working with massive
untargeted amounts of components data and to improve data quality.
On the basis of Figure 7 (panels B and C),
MS intensity higher than 104 and CV less than 20% are used to filter
the raw intensity data, and the filtered intensity range of each cell
line is plotted in Figure 7D. The untargeted
components data show similar trends as the targeted metabolite data
(Figure 8 (panels A and B). Quantile normalization
increases the number of metabolites (Maxchange ≤ 2) from 1940
to 2099 and meanwhile decreases the number of metabolites (Maxchange
≥ 32) from 34 to 20. When untargeted components intensities
are used, as shown in Figure 8 (panels C–F),
neither Spearman rank-based clustering nor Pearson correlation-based
clustering is affected by quantile normalization of MS intensity.
However, compared to the clustering pattern based on the Spearman
ranking of 375 targeted metabolites, clustering based on 2931 untargeted
components is different for the cell line SW620. The pool of metabolites
tends to affect the clustering pattern for both Pearson correlations
and Spearman ranking based-clustering. However, there are few conserved
subclusters, such as cell lines HT29 and HCT116 and cell lines HCT8
and SW948, which are always clustered together regardless of the clustering
method used.

Discussion
Our
chromatography method involving HPLC, employed a high pH mobile
phase and amide column, coupled with positive/negative switching HRMS
enables us to analyze both acidic and basic polar metabolites in a
single experiment. Even though this method is not optimized for recovery
of any specific metabolite, it nevertheless enables us to cover a
large number of polar metabolites and lipids. Moreover, there are
some important polar metabolites, such as coenzyme A derivatives and
folates, which are not detected in our method. It is either due to
their low abundance in the cells lines we used or their instability.29−31 Therefore, for these metabolites, additional optimization of the
extraction procedure will be required.

For a long time, MS was
not considered as a quantitative analytical
technology, because for metabolites with different chemical structures,
they tend to have different ionization efficiency, and even for the
same metabolite, if it is measured at different times or spiked into
different biological samples, the MS response tends to fluctuate,
which is due to the matrix effect.32,33 Therefore,
stable heavy isotope-labeled standards (stds) are commonly spiked
into unknown samples to correct the error introduced by sample preparations
and MS response fluctuations.12 In our
LC–MS setup, within a wide range, the MS intensity increases
in a linear pattern when the corresponding samples are prepared from
increasing cell numbers, which gives us high confidence of label-free
differential quantitative analysis based on our current workflow.
This linearity is observed even when samples of interest are randomly
dispersed across large sample runs. Moreover, the CVs within biological
triplicates at sufficient peak intensity levels are very small, implying
that our current workflow is very reproducible, and subtle biological
variations of metabolites in different samples can be measured. However,
too much material results in severe ion suppression and also induces
overload in the LC, so overall, a smaller number of cells (3 ×
105 to 2 × 106 of cells) results in a larger
number of metabolites capable of being detected. To overcome the day-to-day
variation (i.e., a batch effect), advanced statistic analysis might
be helpful.34,35 For absolute quantitation, internal
stds or external calibration curves are still required, although it
is conceivable that a regression model could circumvent the need for
calibration curves in some instances.

In order to compare the
metabolomics profiling differences in different
cell types, quantile normalization was applied to rescale the metabolite
intensities. However, based on our study, quantile normalization results
in only modest effects on the CV or Maxchange calculations. Its effect
on clustering patterns across the whole data set is however readily
apparent.

Since HRMS records almost every ion falling into the
scan range
and above the limit of detection, little effort is required to build
a detection method for each metabolite, but an efficient approach
to deal with massive data is critical. Untargeted component-based
approaches cover almost every ion recorded in the spectrum if filtering
parameters are set at very low values, but this would be inefficient
in its computational cost. Practically, a targeted approach is more
efficient, even though metabolites outside of the list will be missed.
In practice, in order to compare metabolic profiling in different
samples, our current targeted list gave a similar cluster pattern
as compared to 2931 untargeted components, as shown in Figure 5 (panels C–F) and Figure 8 (C–F). Therefore, in our study, a targeted approach
is done first to make metabolic profiling, and then very specific
filters are applied to narrow down untargeted components, followed
by database searching to make sure no interesting metabolite is missed.

MS/MS data can further increase confidence of unknown metabolite
identification, especially for metabolites with isomers and poor separation
on LC (Figure 3). However, the MS/MS database
is far from complete, and also MS/MS spectra in the database were
generated from different types of mass spectrometry with different
fragmentation methods. It has been shown that the MS/MS pattern is
dependent on how collision energy is applied and also the elemental
composition of the collision gas.28 Moreover,
to obtain useful MS/MS spectra, a precursor ion of sufficient intensity
is required. Due to these limitations, efforts are needed to further
develop a high throughput method for MS/MS data processing and metabolite
identification.

Eight colorectal cancer cell lines show three
distinct metabolic
patterns which gives us a hint that the metabolic enzymes are either
differentially expressed or with variant activities across these cell
lines. This potentially suggests opportunities for biomarker analysis
in metabolomics applications.

Conclusion
The platform demonstrated
here is applicable for targeted and untargeted
label-free polar metabolites quantitative analysis. Besides cell culture
work, this method is being applied to biomarker studies using tissues,
serum, and other human fluids, and provides a resource to the metabolomics
field. With such a technology, further investigation that connects
metabolite profile to biological phenotype is possible.
