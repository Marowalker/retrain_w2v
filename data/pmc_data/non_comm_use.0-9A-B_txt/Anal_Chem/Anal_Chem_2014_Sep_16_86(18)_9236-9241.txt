Molecular diagnostics based on the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
offer rapid and sensitive means for detecting infectious disease,
but prohibitive costs have impeded their use in resource-limited settings
where such diseases are endemic. In this work, we report an innovative
method for transforming a desktop computer and a mobile camera phone—devices
that have become readily accessible in developing countries—into
a highly sensitive DNA detection system. This transformation was achieved
by converting a desktop computer into a de facto thermal
cycler with software that controls the temperature of the central
processing unit (CPU), allowing for highly efficient PCR. Next, we
reconfigured the mobile phone into a fluorescence imager by adding
a low-cost filter, which enabled us to quantitatively measure the
resulting PCR amplicons. Our system is highly sensitive, achieving
quantitative detection of as little as 9.6 attograms of target DNA,
and we show that its performance is comparable to advanced laboratory
instruments at approximately 1/500th of the cost. Finally, in order
to demonstrate clinical utility, we have used our platform for the
successful detection of genomic DNA from the parasite that causes
Chagas disease, Trypanosoma cruzi, directly in whole,
unprocessed human blood at concentrations 4-fold below the clinical
titer of the parasite.

Although
advanced molecular
diagnostic technologies for the detection of infectious diseases such
as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria, and tuberculosis1,2 are widely available in the developed world, prohibitive costs of
equipment and reagents have impeded their adoption in the less developed
countries (LDCs) in which these diseases are most prevalent.3−6 In contrast, access to certain consumer electronics has surged over
the past decade in these same LDCs. For instance, the number of mobile
cellular subscribers in the developing world rose by more than 600
million between 2010 and 2011,7 and desktop
computer penetration has dramatically accelerated since the start
of the millenium.8

This trend offers
an exciting opportunity for leveraging such tools
as a means to affordably improve healthcare. For example, the built-in
cameras in mobile phones have been adapted as imaging platforms9,10 for detecting disease biomarkers and infectious pathogens11−16 in blood and other clinically relevant samples.17−20 However, as these methods are
microscopy-based, they can suffer from poor limits of detection and
the challenge of differentiating among similar species, subspecies,
and strains.21 Nucleic acid-based genetic
tests offer higher sensitivity and exquisite specificity,22,23 and several innovative approaches have been explored to develop
low-cost assays and instruments for genetic detection at the point-of-care.
For example, Manage et al. achieved streamlined detection of BK viruses
by performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) directly in whole blood
using self-contained gel strips.24 In addition,
several groups have demonstrated “sample-in-answer-out”
systems that integrate multiple process steps into a monolithic device
using microfluidics technology.25−28 The Landers group pioneered the use of microfluidics
for genetic analysis,29 isolating and amplifying
nucleic acids directly from buccal swabs and whole blood for clinical
examination.30 Our group has similarly
demonstrated direct detection of H1N1 influenza viruses in throat
swab samples by integrating magnetic separation with reverse transcriptase
PCR (RT-PCR) in a disposable device.31 In
practice, however, the deployment of these systems in low-resource
settings is challenging because they often rely on specialized devices
and instrumentation (e.g., pumps, syringes, and detectors) that have
limited availability and require skilled technicians for operation.

We have developed an alternate approach to molecular diagnostics
that largely eliminates the need for such apparatuses. Instead of
relying on custom-built machines, we repurpose a desktop PC and a
mobile camera phone into a highly sensitive platform for genetic detection
of pathogens. Specifically, we use low-cost software tools to convert
the PC into a de facto thermal cycler for PCR and
configure mobile phones as imagers to detect and quantify the resulting
PCR amplicons. To our knowledge, this is the first work to perform
PCR reactions using a PC. In our PC-PCR-Phone (P3) system, a small
volume of patient blood is added directly to a length of disposable
tubing that has been preloaded with PCR reagents (Figure 1, step 1). The tubing is then placed into the heat
sink of the central processing unit (CPU), where PCR is performed
by using two software programs to precisely manipulate the PC’s
internal temperature (Figure 1, step 2). Subsequently,
we use a mobile phone camera to image the amplified products, which
are quantified according to their fluorescence intensity (Figure 1, step 3). As a model, we used our P3 system to
detect genomic DNA (gDNA) from Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), the parasitic protist responsible for Chagas
disease,32,33 which affects over 17 million people worldwide.34,35 We demonstrate direct detection from blood with a limit of detection
of 0.1 fg/μL, which is well below the average parasitic loads
found in clinical samples (0.4 fg/μL).

Figure 1 P3 assay schematic. First,
a small drop of blood obtained via finger
prick is added to a length of preloaded capillary tubing containing
the reagents required for PCR. The tubing is then inserted between
the cooling fins on the heat sink in the computer. Commercial software
controls CPU usage, cyclically heating and cooling the computer according
to a protocol designed to amplify target DNA. After thermal cycling,
the samples are exposed to UV light and imaged with a camera phone.
By comparing a histogram of the pixel intensities for the patient
sample relative to control samples, the presence or absence of target
pathogenic DNA can be determined.

Materials and Methods
General Information
All synthetic
DNA sequences were
purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). Hot-start polymerase
master mix and nuclease-free water were purchased from Promega. PCR
validation was performed with a 100-nt single-stranded DNA sequence
reported previously as Thr-02,36 using
primers AGCAGCACAGAGGTCAGATG and TTCACGGTAGCACGCATAGG.
DMSO was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and used
at the concentration indicated. SYBR Green I was obtained from Life
Technologies and used at 0.625× concentration, and EvaGreen was
obtained from Biotium and used at 1× concentration. Whole blood
preserved in EDTA was obtained from Bioreclamation. Hemo KlenTaq (HKT)
polymerase and 5× buffer were obtained from New England Biolabs
and used in the manufacturer recommended amount. Melting temperatures
were measured via the iQ5 real-time multicolor detection system (Bio-Rad).

PC-Based PCR
For initial validation experiments, we
used 2 fmol of 100-nt template, with 1 μM primer in a 50 μL
reaction that included PCR mix (containing DNA polymerase, dNTPs,
buffer), EvaGreen, primers, and 13% DMSO. The optimal DMSO concentration
was determined prior to carrying out PCR in a PC by testing the effect
of DMSO on dsDNA hybridization in the reaction mixture described above.
Melting temperatures were determined by performing 40 cycles of two-step
PCR on the 100-nt template to generate double-stranded products in
the iQ5. Post-amplification, we carried out a thermal gradient beginning
at 65 °C and increasing to 85 °C at a rate of 1 °C
per minute and dwell time of 10 s, with fluorescence intensity measured
every minute. We then calculated the negative first derivative of
the plot of the resulting melting profile of intensity versus temperature.
The melting temperature is where this differential plot reaches a
maximum, as calculated by Bio-Rad iQ5 melt curve analysis (Supplemental
Figure 2, Supporting Information). To perform
PC-based PCR, the reaction mixture was preloaded into short capillaries
of perfluoroalkoxyl (PFA) tubing. After adding template at a concentration
of 40 fg/μL, the capillary tubes were permanently sealed at
both ends by epoxy (Devcon) to yield contaminant-free testers that
are amenable to high-throughput manufacturing. The capillary tube
was then inserted between the CPU heat sink fins of a Dell Pentium
4 desktop computer for cycling.

For measuring the actual temperature
of the sample, we used a digital thermometer (Fluke) and K type thermocouple
(Omega). Thermal measurements were performed by recording the solution
temperature inside the capillaries with 50 μL of distilled water
using a thermocouple probe. We used two programs to automate the PCR
thermocycling process with the computer. The heating of the CPU was
achieved with BurnInTest software (Passmark), while SpeedFan (Almico)
program obtained the CPU temperature from the built-in thermocouples
and controlled the fan for cooling.

The resulting PCR product
was loaded and run on 10% TBE polyacrylamide
gels (Bio-Rad) with a 20 bp DNA ladder (Bio-Rad) in 4 °C running
buffer. After 15 min of gel electrophoresis at 300 V, the gels were
stained with Gelstar (Lonza) for 10 min. The stained gels were imaged
on a Gel Logic System using UV transillumination and a 535 nm optical
filter (Kodak). The positive control PCR was performed by taking an
aliquot of the same sample and carrying out amplification in a commercial
thermal cycler using 0.2 mL capped tubes (Bio-Rad). In both the PC
and cycler, the template was amplified for no more than 20 cycles.
This number was calculated to be the appropriate threshold cycle (Ct) based on real-time quantitative PCR using
a Bio-Rad iQ5.

Genomic DNA from T. cruzi (Tulahuen
strain) was
obtained from ATCC. The sequence for the Diaz primer set was CGCAAACAGATATTGACAGA
and TGTTCACACACTGGACACCAA,38 which target the 195-bp repetitive element in T.
cruzi nuclear DNA. Capillaries were prepped with 20 μL
of reaction mixture containing HK Taq polymerase, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1×
buffer, SYBR Green I, 0.2 μM primers, and 13% DMSO. Spiked human
whole blood containing gDNA (or blood itself in the case of the negative
control) was added to a final concentration of 5% (v/v) by pipetting
the blood into the tubing and allowing it to settle at the bottom
of the buffer layer without any vigorous mixing.37 Next, 1 μL of human blood was loaded into the capillaries,
and the capillary tubes were sealed on both ends and heated in a boiling
water bath for 2 min to simulate cell lysis and gDNA denaturation
steps prior to PC-PCR amplification. From an initial annealing/extension
temperature of 64.5 °C, the annealing/extension step was reduced
by a difference of 3 °C every three cycles for the initial step-down
cycling phase. After 15 cycles, we maintained the annealing temperature
at 49.5 °C for 40 cycles to complete the amplification phase
of SD-PCR (Supplemental Figure S5, Supporting
Information).

Post-PCR Imaging
Initial characterization
of the camera
phone’s (Samsung Galaxy S) fluorescent imaging capabilities
was performed with EvaGreen dye, and the PCR products were generated
from the Thr-02 template after 30 cycles of PCR in a standard thermal
cycler (Bio-Rad). Real-time quantitative PCR in a Bio-Rad iQ5 was
used to determine that 30 cycles was the upper threshold for efficient
amplification of a single PCR product from this template. Further
applications with SYBR Green I stain and T. cruzi gDNA in whole blood were performed according to the SD-PCR protocol
described in the section above. Samples were excited by a UV transilluminator
(Kodak). For imaging, a 520 ± 10 nm bandpass filter (Edmund Optics)
was placed over the mobile phone camera and held in place by a silicone
case. The phone was situated at fixed distance above the samples,
and the image was captured using the “night mode” option
on the camera phone. Images were transferred to a computer and analyzed
with ImageJ software (http://www.nih.gov/). Rectangular
regions of interest were drawn around each sample, and the histogram
of pixel intensities was obtained. Mean histogram values of all samples
were then background-subtracted with the mean histogram value of an
empty tube. Average and standard deviations are the result of at least
four individual trial runs. Data were imported into MATLAB and plotted.
For relative image analysis, the imsubtract function in MATLAB was
used to subtract each element in a sample image by the same element
in the blank (empty) image. From the resulting RGB values, background-subtracted
images were graphed using the imshow function.

Results and Discussion
Efficient
Amplification of Genomic DNA in Blood Using a PC
PCR amplification
of genomic DNA (gDNA) in blood can be hindered
by the presence of enzymatic inhibitors naturally found in blood or
anticoagulants added after sample collection.39 To circumvent this problem, we implemented three key modifications
to the standard PCR protocol40 (see Materials and Methods). First, we used a step-down
(SD)-PCR41 approach that enables specific
and high-yield amplification of long template DNA (i.e., gDNA) with
reduced byproducts.42 Second, we adopted
a two-temperature PCR scheme, consisting of a hot start followed by
alternating hybridization/extension and denaturation steps, simplifying
accurate feedback control of the CPU temperature.

To complete
the modified PCR protocol associated with our system, we reduced the
denaturation temperature to below the maximum temperature for safe,
extended CPU operation (90 °C). We achieved this by adding dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) to our PCR mixture, which decreased the melting temperature
(Tm) of our primer-template duplex by
−0.6 °C per 1% DMSO (Supplemental Figure S1, Supporting Information). As an added benefit,
the addition of DMSO also improves yield and further reduces undesired
byproducts.43,44

Software-Based Thermal
Cycling in a PC
We installed
two software programs that can effectively convert a desktop PC into
a PCR thermal cycler. The first program (BurnIn Test) is used to rapidly
increase the CPU temperature through intensive computational operations.
The second program (SpeedFan) measures the temperature of the CPU
in real-time using the built-in thermal sensors common to all CPUs
and also controls the cooling fan. By running these two programs,
the surface temperature of the CPU can be precisely regulated under
automated control (Figure 2a, black trace).
However, due to thermal resistance between the heat sink and tubing
(even in the presence of interfacing compounds such as thermal paste),
the temperature of the blood sample is lower than that of the CPU.
In order to correct for this difference, we measured the actual temperature
of the sample using thermocouples (Figure 2a, green trace). These data indicate that the difference in temperature
between the CPU and sample does not vary by more than several degrees
and can be accurately predicted with a calibration curve. We established
a linear correlation with excellent fit (R2 = 0.992 for heating and 0.995 for cooling, Supplemental Figure S2, Supporting Information) to account for the effect
of thermal resistance. Since this thermal resistance should not vary
across models of PC, we believe our calibration curve can be used
generally and that it is not necessary to calibrate each PC individually.Figure 2 DNA amplification
achieved via robust thermal cycling within the
PC heat sink. (a) Temperature traces of the reported CPU temperature
(black trace) as recorded by SpeedFan software compared with the measured
sample temperature (green trace) as obtained by a thermocouple probe
over the course of three cycles. Each two-step PCR cycle started at
a temperature of 55 °C for annealing and extension, which was
then raised to 83 °C for melting. The vertical bars indicate
when the CPU (heating, red bars) and fans (cooling, blue bars) were
active. (b) PAGE image showing amplification of a synthetic 100-nt
template from reactions performed within the PC heat sink. Control
reactions were performed by carrying out 20 cycles of PCR on aliquots
of the same negative and positive samples in a commercial thermal
cycler.



PC-PCR Produces Single-Length
Amplicons with High Yield
Our system is capable of simultaneously
performing PCR on up to 29
samples with reproducible yield and no spurious byproducts. To verify
that our PCR protocol only generates amplicons of the predicted 100-nt
length, we prepared 10 identical samples (20 μL each) and monitored
the reaction at every other PCR cycle. Visualization with polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (PAGE) clearly showed a single product band that
matched positive control amplicons obtained with a conventional laboratory
thermal cycler (Supplemental Figure S3, Supporting
Information). We subsequently tested the capacity of our system
by performing PCR on 29 identical reactions distributed across the
CPU heat sink. We observed minimal variability in amplification (Figure 2b), both among the various CPU samples and relative
to a control amplification performed in a laboratory thermal cycler,
as measured by image densitometry following PAGE (C.V. < 4%).

Optical DNA Detection with a Camera Phone
In order
to achieve convenient and quantitative means of readout after amplification,
we repurposed a standard camera phone into a quantitative DNA detection
platform capable of measuring as little as 9.6 ag of template DNA.
Specifically, we outfitted the camera phone with a monochromatic filter
to capture fluorescence from a DNA binding dye (see Materials and Methods). This dye is present in the PCR mix
prior to the reaction and emits green light (peak wavelength = 520
nm) under UV excitation when complexed with double-stranded DNA amplicons.
Using this setup, we were able to clearly differentiate fluorescent
signals obtained from PCR reactions performed in a conventional thermal
cycler with samples containing as little as 9.6 ag of template DNA
relative to a template-free negative control (Figure 3a). Moreover, the detection performance of our camera phone
system is comparable to that of a laboratory real-time quantitative
PCR (qPCR) instrument. Software analysis yielded normalized, mean
fluorescence intensity values of our camera phone images (see Materials and Methods), which we plotted as a function
of template copy number (Figure 3b, black).
We compared these results with the normalized end-point fluorescence
values obtained from a qPCR instrument (Bio-Rad iQ5) (Figure 3b, red). We found that the respective performance
of these two platforms correlates very closely, with an R2 > 0.99 (Supplemental Figure S4, Supporting Information), and falls within each other’s
error range at low template values (<153 ag).

for 30 cycles with EvaGreen, excited by UV transillumination, and
imaged with a mobile phone camera and 520 nm filter. (b) Sensitivity
and specificity of camera phone detection of amplified DNA in comparison
to qPCR end-point detection. The normalized fluorescence for 10 independent
experiments is plotted versus the log of the initial template mass.

Detection of T.
cruzi Using the P3 System
The average concentration
of T. cruzi gDNA in
blood samples of patients infected with Chagas disease is 0.4 fg/μL.45 We found that our P3 system can attain sensitivities
below this level from unprocessed whole blood samples. We performed
P3 analysis on 20 μL samples containing 1 μL of whole
blood that had been spiked with 0, 0.1, 1, 10, or 100 fg of T. cruzi gDNA. After subtracting the background fluorescence
from an empty capillary tube, we could clearly distinguish reactions
that had been performed with as little as 0.1 fg/μL gDNA from
negative controls (Figure 4a). PAGE analysis
confirmed that the amplicons detected by the P3 system were the predicted
195-bp satellite repeat specific to the Diaz1/Diaz2 primer set46 and that the PCR performance is comparable to
that of a laboratory thermal cycler instrument (Figure 4b). These data suggest that our P3 system should be capable
of detecting clinically relevant concentrations of T. cruzi gDNA directly from the blood of patients infected with Chagas disease.

Figure 4 Detection
of T. cruzi gDNA in whole blood. (a)
Images of capillary tubing positioned above bar graphs depict the
fluorescence signal obtained from each amount of template gDNA after
background subtraction. P3 is sufficiently sensitive to reproducibly
detect 0.1 fg of gDNA in 1 μL of whole blood. Error bars were
obtained from 4 replicates. (b) Gel analysis shows the specific amplification
of a 195-nt region of tandemly repeating gDNA. A side-by-side comparison
of the same sample after PCR carried out in a PC or a laboratory thermal
cycler shows that PC-PCR can match the efficiency of laboratory instrumentation.

Conclusions
In this work, we report the feasibility of transforming a desktop
computer and cell phone into a molecular diagnostic system capable
of highly sensitive and quantitative pathogen DNA detection. These
devices are becoming increasingly available in developing countries,
especially with the aid of humanitarian organizations dedicated to
expanding the reach of technology in areas of need.47,48 Using two programs, one free and the other affordably priced, we
are able to convert a PC into a highly responsive thermal cycler;
by adding a simple filter, we are likewise able to use a standard
camera phone for the quantitative optical detection of PCR amplicons.
We showed that the P3 system is capable of achieving sensitivities
and specificities comparable to that of conventional laboratory instruments
at 1/500th of the cost (Supplemental Table S1, Supporting Information). In an initial demonstration with
the Chagas disease pathogen T. cruzi, we achieved
a limit of detection for gDNA that is 4-fold below the average clinical
concentration typically found in patients. There are a number of advantageous
features inherent to the P3 system. First, sample prep and handling
is minimal, as our assay is performed directly in blood with no need
for mechanical or chemical processing and only a brief boiling step
required as a prelude to PCR. Additionally, P3 greatly reduces the
potential for cross-contamination through the use of a single, sealed
capillary tube. Finally, our system allows multiple samples to be
analyzed at once (up to 29 in the current configuration), and we envision
that it can be adopted for multiplexed detection of multiple pathogens
in separate capillaries.

The sensor technology presented here
represents a rapid and facile
means of pathogen detection in low-resource settings, as indicated
by the detection of gDNA in blood. In its current iteration, we anticipate
that P3 will work primarily as a binary diagnostic assay in which
an end point sample readout is compared to positive and negative controls
to determine the presence of pathogenic infection. Though beyond the
scope of this work, we envision that future iterations of the system
will demonstrate equivalent performance with patient blood samples
containing intact parasites. Several examples in the literature have
already established precedents for successful PCR-based detection
in blood samples without DNA extraction directly from pathogens such
as parasites49 and viruses,50 as well as trypanosomes.51 We are therefore confident that P3 can achieve a similar
level of performance with minimal modifications through techniques
such as heat pretreatment and optimization of buffers to facilitate
the release of gDNA from lysed pathogens. Finally, we are currently
investigating the potential for adapting P3 for use in more remote
regions. As resource-limited settings may not have access to reliable
power sources for refrigeration or computational operation, lyophilized
reagents22 and battery-powered laptops
could be implemented in future iterations. Laptop CPUs have the added
advantage of functioning at even higher temperatures than desktop
computers with increased portability. Similarly, low-cost blue LEDs
and a blacked-out cardboard box can replace UV transilluminators while
blocking ambient light for a more inexpensive method of dye excitation
(peak absorption wavelength = 500 nm). In sum, we report an innovative
method for transforming widely available consumer electronics into
tools for molecular biotechnology. We believe such repurposing may
offer versatile strategies for providing molecular diagnostic capabilities
to resource-limited settings in a cost-effective manner for a diverse
spectrum of diseases.
