Porous
graphitic carbon (PGC) is an important tool in a chromatographer’s
armory that retains polar compounds with mass spectrometry (MS)-compatible
solvents. However, its applicability is severely limited by an unpredictable
loss of retention, which can be attributed to contamination. The solutions
offered fail to restore the original retention and our observations
of retention time shifts of gemcitabine/metabolites on PGC are not
consistent with contamination. The mobile phase affects the ionization
state of analytes and the polarizable PGC surface that influences
the strength of dispersive forces governing retention on the stationary
phase. We hypothesized that failure to maintain the same PGC surface
before and after running a gradient is a cause of the observed retention
loss/variability on PGC. Herein, we optimize the choice of mobile
phase solvent in a gradient program with three parts: a preparatory
phase, which allows binding of analytes to column; an elution phase,
which gives the required separation/peak shape; and a maintenance
phase, to preserve the required retention capacity. Via liquid chromatography/tandem
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of gemcitabine and its metabolites
extracted from tumor tissue, we demonstrate reproducible chromatography
on three PGC columns of different ages. This approach simplifies use
of the PGC to the same level as that of a C-18 column, removes the
need for column regeneration, and minimizes run times, thus allowing
PGC columns to be used to their full potential.

==== Body
There are
well-known challenges
posed by chromatographic separation of polar compounds such as nucleosides
and nucleotides with subsequent detection by mass spectrometry (MS).1,2 Equally well documented are the drawbacks of possible solutions
such as MS contamination (e.g., when using ion-pairing reagents) and
reduced sensitivity.1,3 Chromatographic methods can be
developed on porous graphitic carbon (PGC) using MS-compatible solvents
that resolve nucleosides and nucleotides with excellent peak shapes.4,5 However, we and others have reported variability and a general loss
of retention on PGC within a run and over a period of time that can
limit its use.6−9 While hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) can
offer a useful alternative, its applications do not always overlap
with those of PGC, so PGC remains an important tool for the chromatography
of polar compounds.

The general loss of retention on PGC is
thought to be mainly due
to the column’s particularly high susceptibility to contamination,7 hence the suggestion to backflush regularly.
Wash procedures involve the use of strong acids/bases and solvents
such as tetrahydrofuran, acetone, trifluoroacetate, hydrochloric acid,
and sodium hydroxide.7,10,11 In addition to contamination, the column’s capacity for redox
reactions has been cited as an important contributor to variability
of retention and poor peak shape. Preconditioning of the column with
buffered hydrogen peroxide has been shown to prevent a loss of retention,
because of reduction of the stationary phase.7,9 All
these treatments add a significant amount of time to sample analysis
and involve the use of significant volumes of hazardous chemicals
but fail to restore the original retention. Thus, there is a need
to better understand the mechanisms underlying analyte retention and
to simplify robust method development on PGC.

A detailed description
of PGC and the hitherto known mechanisms
of retention have been well-reviewed elsewhere.12 Retention is thought to occur through a combination of
factors with interactions between the mobile phase and analytes promoting
or discouraging retention. Forces such as hydrogen bonds (that keep
analytes in solution) discourage retention. On the other hand, hydrophobic
interactions promote retention by pushing analytes out of solution
toward the PGC surface. Nonpolar analytes interact with the PGC surface
via dispersive forces while polar ones are retained via charge induction
on the polarizable PGC surface. The mobile phase is a major determinant
of retention because it influences the ionization state of both analytes
and the PGC surface.13 We hypothesized
that failure to maintain the same PGC surface before and after running
a gradient is a cause of the observed retention loss/variability on
PGC. We now report a method for robust maintenance of retention capacity
of gemcitabine and its metabolites on PGC through careful selection
of the mobile phase and sequence in a gradient elution program that
obviates the need for washing.

Experimental Section
Reagents and Chemicals
Acetonitrile, methanol, water
(HPLC grade), and ammonium hydroxide were purchased from Fisher Scientific
(U.K.). Ammonium acetate (LC-MS grade) and CTP–15N2,13C were obtained from Sigma (U.K.). Gemcitabine
(2′,2′-difluoro-2′-deoxycytidine, dFdC), was
purchased from Tocris, while its metabolites—2′,2′-difluoro-2′-deoxyuridine
(dFdU), gemcitabine 5′-triphosphate (dFdCTP), gemcitabine 5′-diphosphate
choline (GdPC),14 stable labeled dFdU–13C,15N2, dFdC–13C,15N2, citicoline-d9—were
purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada).

Instrumentation
Samples were injected using a CTC PAL
HTS-xt autosampler (CTC Analytics AG, Switzerland) with two wash stations:
solvent 1 (50% methanol in water) and solvent 2 (water). Chromatography
was performed with an Accela pump (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).
Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis was performed using a TSQ
Vantage triple-stage quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific,
USA) fitted with a heated electrospray ionization (HESI-II) probe
operated in positive and negative mode at a spray voltage of 2.5 kV,
a capillary temperature of 150 °C, and a vaporizer temperature
of 250 °C. Sheath and auxiliary gas pressures were set at 50
and 20 units, respectively. Quantitative data acquisition was performed
using LC Quan2.5.6 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The MS scan parameters
have been described previously.6,14

Chromatography
PGC Hypercarb (100 mm × 2.1 mm,
ID 5 μm; Thermo Fisher Scientific) columns were kept at 40 °C
and fitted with a guard column (Hypercarb, 10 mm × 2.1 mm, 5
μm; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Three different PGC columns were
tested, each of which had previously been used for a period of 1–3
years.

Gemcitabine (dFdC) and its metabolites—dFdU, dFdCTP,
and GdPC (200 ng/mL of each analyte)—were spiked into tumor
tissue homogenate prepared from MIA PaCa-2 xenografts and extracted
as previously described.6 The repeatability
of retention and peak shape was assessed for 95 injections.

Repeatability of retention time was also assessed for gemcitabine
and dFdU (spiked in water) on an Acquity UPLC T3 C-18 column (50 mm
× 2.1 mm, ID 1.8 μm; Waters) maintained at 40 °C (for
comparison with PGC). dFdCTP and GdPC are not retained on the C18
column and, therefore, were not analyzed. The gradient elution program
comprised mobile phase A (0.1% formate in water) and mobile phase
B (0.1% formate in 100% acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 200 μL/min.
The gradient was initiated with 100% A for 1 min, followed by an increase
over 1 min to 70% of B and back to 100% A over another minute. An
additional minute of 100% A completed the gradient to give a total
run time of 4 min.

Results and Discussion
Lack of Consistent Retention
on PGC with Previous Methods
Problems with previous methods
start when a new column is exposed
to mobile phases other than methanol:water ((95:5), hereafter referred
to as 95% methanol), which may modify the surface of the stationary
phase resulting in altered retention properties. This causes failure
to get reproducible retention from one injection to the next, or on
two different columns with the same method (see Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information). Two papers
by Jansen et al.4,9 illustrate this: despite treating
the columns with preconditioning buffer containing 0.05% hydrogen
peroxide, the retention time of gemcitabine between the two studies
differed by 2.73 min. Our previous gradient elution program (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), which
had at least 5% acetonitrile throughout,6 suffered from the same problems; gemcitabine retention capacity
slowly reduced and limited the number of samples that could be analyzed
in one batch. This meant that after approximately every 50 samples
regeneration of the PGC column was required. This involved inversion
and back-flushing with 50% tetrahydrofuran (THF), 0.1% trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA), then 50% THF plus 0.1% sodium hydroxide, then water, then
re-equilibration with 95% methanol prior to reuse.

Development
of the Chromatography
We hypothesized that
understanding PGC surface-altering interactions of different mobile
phases would enable development of a method that maintained the same
PGC surface before and after each sample, standardizing the retention
time. Polar analytes interact with the surface of the stationary phase
via charge-induced interactions, while nonpolar analytes interact
via dispersive forces whose strength may be affected by charge induction
caused by the mobile phase.13 The PGC surface
may be charged due to the effects of mobile phase pH on ionizable
functional groups.13 In addition, the mobile
phase may be involved in electron lone-pair interactions with the
electron cloud of graphite15 that may expose
analyte-retaining charge on the PGC surface. However, it is not clear
if the mobile phase must be adsorbed to be involved in electron lone-pair
interactions with the surface of the stationary phase. Therefore,
a switch from one mobile phase to another may cause a fundamental
change to the column’s surface resulting in a modification
of retention. The extent of modification of the surface would be dependent
on the mobile phases involved. A new PGC column comes stored in 95%
methanol and using this as a mobile phase should ensure maintenance
of retention without the need for any column regeneration. The hypothesis
was tested by analysis of gemcitabine (dFdC) and three of its metabolites.

Under isocratic conditions (95% methanol) however, only dFdC and
dFdU were retained and eluted from the column. dFdCTP and GdPC may
have eluted together with the column void volume (Figure S2A in the Supporting Information). We reasoned that,
consistent with previous studies,15,16 charge induction
on the PGC by methanol could have occurred via its two electron lone
pairs interacting with the electron cloud of graphite, resulting in
the exposure of some positive charge on the column. Increasing pH
would ensure ionization of the phosphate groups that could be important
for retention of dFdCTP and, to a lesser extent, GdPC. Indeed, a switch
to 10 mM ammonium acetate (pH 10) (pH adjusted using ammonium hydroxide)
in 95% methanol resulted in retention of all four analytes (dFdC,
dFdU, dFdCTP, and GdPC) on PGC (Figure S2B in the Supporting Information). In an attempt to increase retention
further and to improve peak shape particularly for dFdCTP and GdPC,
the percentage of methanol was reduced from 95% to 70% (Figure S3A in the Supporting Information) and
finally to 50% (Figure S3B in the Supporting
Information). Reducing the methanol concentration resulted in increased
retention, but the peaks became broader. In order to increase retention
and to make the peaks sharper, a gradient elution program was then
tested.

Designing a Gradient Elution Program with a Maintenance Step
According to our hypothesis, water with its two electron lone pairs
could interact with the graphite electrons in a manner similar to
that of methanol. Adjusting the pH to 10 would also ensure maintenance
of the negative charge on the phosphate groups of dFdCTP and GdPC.
Therefore, water would be an excellent part of the preparatory phase,
because it would allow binding of all analytes to the column. The
second part of the gradient focused on elution of the analytes and,
for this, we used acetonitrile to disrupt the charge induced by water
and compete for dispersive interactions with the PGC surface. The
acetonitrile gradient was optimized to give excellent peak shapes,
and a final step of 95% methanol (in water) was added to ensure maintenance
of the original retention capacity. The optimal elution gradient is
shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Gradient elution program
on the PGC column (100 mm × 2.1 mm,
ID 5 μm) thermostated at 40 °C. The mobile phase at a flow
rate of 0.3 mL/min consisted of (A) 10 mM ammonium acetate, pH 10;
(B) 100% acetonitrile; and (C) 95% methanol, 5% water.

Analytical Runs
Analytical runs
on PGC are notorious
for very long equilibration times, with some groups reporting times
up to 2 h,17 while others had to precondition
the column using an acidic buffer before starting a run.9 In this study, an analytical run was started
by ensuring the original methanol-specific retention capacity (running
95% methanol at 150 μL/min for just 5 min). This was followed
by an equilibration of the column for only 2.5 min with mobile phase
A (10 mM ammonium acetate pH 10 in water). The retention time stabilized
after just one injection. Use of the mobile phases as shown in Figure 1 maintained retention
capacity from one sample to the next, with typical peak shapes demonstrated
in Figure 2. Thus,
there was no need for additional steps such as injecting formic acid
between each sample, which others have used to correct for loss of
retention.9 The number of samples one can
run on a PGC column before losing retention/peak shape has been a
big issue; Jansen et al.9 were able to
maintain retention for 60 injections, but this necessitated the use
of hydrogen peroxide. Performance of our method was tested by extracting
the analytes from tumor tissue homogenate and 95 injections were run
on each of three different PGC columns of varying age and usage (over
3 years). Over the 95 injections, peak shape and retention were maintained:
the maximum standard deviation for retention time was ±0.03 min
for all four analytes on all three columns (coefficient of variation
<1%) (see Table 1).

dFdU, GdPC, and dFdCTP (200 ng/mL) spiked and extracted from tumor
homogenate, separated using the gradient shown in Figure 1 and detected following heated

In order to test how this gradient on PGC compared to the performance
of a C-18 column using the same pump, a method was set up on an Acquity
T3 C-18 column for gemcitabine and dFdU only (because the phosphorylated
metabolites dFdCTP and GdPC are not retained on the C-18 column, eluting
in the column void volume) (see Figure S-4 in the Supporting Information). Comparing Figure S-4 with Figure 2 and Table 1 indicates
that the PGC is just as robust as a C-18 column with excellent peak
shapes, with the added advantage of being able to retain dFdCTP and
GdPC.

Use of Mobile Phases Other Than 95% Methanol for the Maintenance
Step
The use of a 95% methanol maintenance step enables the
performance of a column to be consistent over time, so that a column
then only needs to be replaced due to a genuine deterioration in performance
and not a reversible modification of its surface by a solvent other
than 95% methanol. The column maintenance step could potentially be
done using any suitable mobile phase and not just 95% methanol. We
predicted that water would interact with the PGC surface in a similar
way to methanol, so its impact on reproducibility of the chromatography
was tested by replacing methanol with water in the maintenance step
(solution C in Figure 1). Reproducible chromatography was obtained with water, but with
slightly longer retention times than with 95% methanol (see Table S-3 in the Supporting Information). Using
acetonitrile in the maintenance step did not work: dFdCTP and GdPC
were no longer retained, illustrating the importance of choosing the
correct mobile phase to use in a gradient elution program.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have developed a liquid chromatography method
on porous graphitic carbon (PGC) that overcomes a key challenge of
variable retention and loss of retention. We applied the approach
to analysis of gemcitabine and its metabolites 2′,2′-difluoro-2′-deoxyuridine
(dFdU), gemcitabine 5′-triphosphate (dFdCTP), and gemcitabine
5′-diphosphate choline (GdPC). The class of nucleoside and
nucleotide compounds has been of interest to bioanalysts for decades,
because of their therapeutic uses as anticancer drugs (e.g., gemcitabine,
cytarabine, capecitabine) and antiviral drugs (e.g., zidovudine, acyclovir).
More recently, the importance of having robust methods for quantifying
endogenous nucleotides and nucleosides has increased, because of a
developing body of literature, demonstrating their roles in epigenetic
control of gene expression18−20 and immune responses.21 The approach that we have described will allow
such molecules to be quantified by liquid chromatography/tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in a robust and reproducible manner without
the need for ion-pairing reagents. Identification of the correct mobile
phase sequence in a gradient elution program that ensures analytes
interact with the same stationary phase with every injection is key
to maintaining reproducible retention on PGC. We believe methanol
modifies the PGC surface (probably via electron lone-pair interaction
with the graphite), allowing consistent analyte retention, indicating
that methanol should form the preparatory and maintenance phases.
Water is predicted to interact similarly with the PGC surface and
may be used in place of methanol (although, in our example, retention
times were longer with water). This approach simplifies use of the
PGC to the same level as that of a C-18 column, removes the need for
column regeneration, minimizes run times, and thus allows PGC columns
to be used to their full potential.
