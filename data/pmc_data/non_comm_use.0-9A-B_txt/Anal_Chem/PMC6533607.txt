Nanopore
sequencing offers a portable and affordable alternative
to sequencing-by-synthesis methods but suffers from lower accuracy
and cannot sequence ultrashort DNA. This puts applications such as
molecular diagnostics based on the analysis of cell-free DNA or single-nucleotide
variants (SNVs) out of reach. To overcome these limitations, we report
a nanopore-based sequencing strategy in which short target sequences
are first circularized and then amplified via rolling-circle amplification
to produce long stretches of concatemeric repeats. After sequencing
on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION platform, the resulting
repeat sequences can be aligned to produce a highly accurate consensus
that reduces the high error-rate present in the individual repeats.
Using this approach, we demonstrate for the first time the ability
to obtain unbiased and accurate nanopore data for target DNA sequences
<100 bp. Critically, this approach is sensitive enough to achieve
SNV discrimination in mixtures of sequences and even enables quantitative
detection of specific variants present at ratios of <10%. Our method
is simple, cost-effective, and only requires well-established processes.
It therefore expands the utility of nanopore sequencing for molecular
diagnostics and other applications, especially in resource-limited
settings.

==== Body
Nanopore
sequencing technology,
most notably commercialized as the hand-held MinION instrument by
Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), has emerged as a powerful sequencing
modality due to its low cost, portability, and capacity to sequence
very long strands of DNA. These features have made nanopore sequencing
indispensable for the assembly of genomes that were previously inaccessible
to conventional short-read, sequencing-by-synthesis methods.1,2 Despite these positive attributes, nanopore sequencing is ill-suited
for important applications, such as the profiling of microRNA (miRNA)3 or cell-free DNA,4 which require sequencing of ultrashort DNA (<100 bp). Specifically,
it has been demonstrated that quality scores drop off dramatically
for sequences shorter than 1 kb.5 To date,
the shortest reported DNA sequence to be directly targeted and sequenced
on a MinION was 434 bp.6,7 Current nanopore sequencing technologies
also have higher error rates relative to the sequencing-by-synthesis
chemistry employed in the widely used Illumina platforms.8 Because of this, conventional nanopore sequencing
is incompatible with applications that require high accuracy, such
as the detection and quantification of single-nucleotide variants
(SNVs). To date, nanopore-based quantification of SNV abundance has
only been achieved through high sequence coverage or by cosequencing
on a high-accuracy short-read platform such as the Illumina MiSeq.9 Therefore, a novel methodology that enables sequencing
of ultrashort DNA with low error-rates would greatly expand the utility
of nanopore sequencing technology.

We describe a simple sample-preparation
strategy that converts
ultrashort DNA into long stretches of tandem repeats (concatemers)
that can be sequenced on the MinION with sufficient accuracy to achieve
reliable SNV detection. To the best of our knowledge, this represents
the first successful nanopore sequencing of target DNA shorter than
100 bp, as well as the first successful resolution of SNVs from single
reads on a nanopore sequencer. Our high-fidelity short reads method
(HiFRe) entails the circularization of short DNA sequences, followed
by the generation of concatemers via rolling-circle amplification
(RCA). These concatemers can be readily sequenced on the MinION, with
the tandem repeats providing highly accurate reads through in silico
reconstruction of the target sequence. Previous work in this area
has illustrated that circularizing and concatemerizing DNA is a robust
approach to improve the fidelity of sequencing in general.10−12 Intramolecular-ligated nanopore consensus sequencing (INCseq),11 for example, uses blunt-end ligation to circularize
double-stranded (ds) DNA of 600–800 bp followed by RCA to create
linear DNA with tandem copies of the template molecule. INCseq improves
the accuracy of MinION sequencing through computational alignment
of the tandem repeats to reconstruct the original sequence. However,
its reliance on blunt-end ligation requires the input DNA to be long
enough to overcome the curvature-induced strain in double-stranded
DNA to achieve circularization, preventing the method from being adapted
to ultrashort reads.

HiFRe offers important advantages over
this and other previously
reported approaches.6,7,11,12 Most importantly, whereas existing methods
for nanopore sequencing of small DNA are still limited to relatively
long fragments of 500–1000 bp, HiFRe enables accurate targeted
analysis of sequences <100 bp. As a demonstration, we have used
HiFRe to sequence targeted 52 bp segments of DNA with high fidelity.
Furthermore, we show that HiFRe enables SNV resolution from a single
nanopore read, with the capacity to accurately quantify mixtures of
sequences based on the discrimination of single-nucleotide differences
at ratios as low as 10:90.

Experimental Section
Reagents
Unless
noted otherwise, all DNA sequences
were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies and all reagents were
purchased from New England Biolabs. Initial DNA concentrations were
measured and normalized to 100 μM via A260 measurement
on a Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific).

Probe Design
Molecular
inversion probes (MIPs) were
carefully designed to minimize secondary structure in the hybridization
regions using a combination of the NUPACK13 and mfold(14) DNA folding
applications. We established a threshold of >90% conversion from
linear
to circular DNA after five cycles of annealing, extension, and ligation.
As described in Calculation S1 of the Supporting Information (SI), this means that any secondary structures in the MIP’s anchor
sites must have a ΔG > −0.33 kcal/mol.
This was an important consideration for the MIP design as a whole
as well as for the barcodes listed in Table S1.

Preamplification and Generation of dsDNA Input Templates
dsDNA was generated from the ssDNA mixtures listed in Table S2. Standard PCR reactions were prepared
as follows: 18 μL ssDNA input, 60 μL 2× GoTaq Master
Mix (Promega), 12 μL 10 μM forward primer (FP), 12 μL
10 μM reverse primer (RP), and 18 μL nuclease-free water
(Ambion). Reactions were carried out by thermocycling with an initial
denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min and 20 cycles of 95 °C for
10 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s on a vapo.protect
Mastercycler Pro thermocycler (Eppendorf). After cleanup with a MinElute
PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) via the manufacturer’s protocol,
amplified dsDNA product was normalized to 100 nM in nuclease-free
water based on Qubit reading. The resultant amplified dsDNA simulates
a typical input to the HiFRe workflow (Figure S1, top).

Circularization Reaction
Optimal
MIP annealing temperature
was determined to be 60.4 °C based on maximum yield after circularization
with a gradient of annealing temperatures ranging from 58 to 70 °C
on a CFX96 Real-Time qPCR System (Bio-Rad). For all of these experiments,
15 nM target dsDNA was circularized with 20 nM MIP. Circularization
reactions (10 μL total volume) were prepared on ice containing
1.5 μL 100 nM target, 2 μL 100 nM MIP, 5 μL 2X Phusion
Master Mix (New England Biolabs), 0.5 μL ampligase (10 U/μL,
Lucigen), and 1 μL 10X ampligase buffer (Lucigen). Circularization
was achieved under the following conditions: 95 °C for 3 min
followed by 5 cycles of 95 °C for 30s, 60.4 °C for 1 min,
and 37 °C for 2 min. After circularization, linear DNA was degraded
by adding 0.45 μL of exonuclease I (20 U/μL) and 0.45
μL of exonuclease III (100 U/μL). The reaction was incubated
at 37 °C for 90 min followed by heat inactivation at 65 °C
for 20 min. Exonuclease inactivation was determined to be sufficiently
efficient based on the lack of exonuclease activity observed in samples
left at 37 °C for 2 days, thus no cleanup step was performed
prior to the RCA reaction.

Rolling Circle Amplification
The
RCA reaction was performed
under the following conditions: 2 μL nuclease-treated circularization
product, 1 μL φ29 (10 U/μL), 1 μL 10 μM
RCA FP, 4 μL dNTP mix (2 mM each, Novagen), 2 μL 10×
φ29 buffer, 7.8 μL nuclease-free water, and 0.2 μL
100X BSA. Reactions were carried out with 12 h incubation at 30 °C,
10 min at 60 °C, and a hold at 4 °C. We also tested 2-,
4-, and 12-h RCA reaction times, and observed no difference in median
product length, which indicates that the protocol could be shortened
substantially with further optimization of the RCA protocol.

We then amplified the single-stranded RCA product to dsDNA with standard
PCR using the following reaction conditions: 9 μL RCA product,
15 μL 2× GoTaq Master Mix (Promega), 1.5 μL 10 μM
FP, 1.5 μL 10 μM RP, and 3 μL nuclease-free water.
The reaction was initiated with a 2 min hot start (95 °C) followed
by 5–8 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 58 °C for 30 s,
and 72 °C for 10 min, with a final extension at 72 °C for
2 min and a hold at 4 °C. The number of cycles was determined
by a pilot PCR with 4–10 cycles of amplification, where we
chose the minimum cycle number that produced a total DNA concentration
of >50 ng/μL with no observed laddering. The resultant dsDNA
was purified using a MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) following
the manufacturer’s protocol.

Sample Pooling
In order to test multiple conditions
on a single flow cell, we incorporated barcodes into the N12 region of the MIPs to enable multiplexing. Samples were prepared
with varying input ratios of target molecules (Table S2). Post-RCA dsDNA products were pooled together before
sequencing based on the measured concentration (HS dsDNA, Qubit) normalized
by the median length reported by the 4200 Tape Station (Agilent).
The median length of amplified RCA product was 6,600 bp.

Nanopore Sequencing
and Data Analysis
The pooled library
was prepared for sequencing via ONT’s Ligation Sequencing 1D
Kit, and then sequenced on a R9.4 flow cell for 24 h according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. We obtained 769,934 raw reads.
Initial base-calling was done through ONT’s MinKNOW software.
We avoided use of more sophisticated nanopore alignment tools, as
we wanted to test the worst-case scenario raw input, with as little
data processing as possible in between the nanopore run and HiFRe
analysis. Custom MATLAB scripts (available at https://github.com/btotherad77/hifre) were developed to parse and analyze the raw nanopore reads. Individual
repeats were identified as regions that mapped significantly to the
FP sequence. The alignment threshold was determined as the average
Smith-Waterman local alignment15 of random
sequences to the FP plus five standard deviations (p < 3 × 10–7). We observed 200,532 raw reads
with 4 or more identifiable repeats. The individual repeats were collected
and aligned to each other using a progressive multialignment algorithm
(multialign, MATLAB). The consensus sequence was
then determined base-wise with a winner-take-all strategy and any
resulting gaps were removed. The individual repeats and the consensus
sequence were then compared back to the original template in order
to assess the accuracy before and after alignment, respectively.

Gel Protocol
Gels were run using a PowerPac Basic (Bio-Rad)
and imaged on a Molecular Imager Gel Doc XR+ (Bio-Rad). For amplified
input DNA and post-RCA dsDNA, native gels were run with 5 μL
per well of a 1:5:1 mixture of sample/water/BlueJuice loading dye
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a 10% TBE, 1 mm, 12-well gel (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) for 45 min at 150 V. For circularized ssDNA and
post-RCA ssDNA, denaturing gels were run with 6 μL per well
of a 1:1 mixture of sample and Gel Loading Buffer II with formamide
(Ambion) in a 10% TBE-Urea, 1 mm, 12-well gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
for 1 h at 200 V. Sample-dye mixtures were denatured at 95 °C
for 7 min prior to loading into the gel.

Results and Discussion
HiFRe enables sequencing analysis of ultrashort DNA targets through
a straightforward procedure of circularization and amplification (Figure 1a). First, we employ
molecular inversion probes (MIPs)16,17 to copy a
target DNA sequence into a circular single-stranded (ss) DNA construct.
For this reaction, we employ the Phusion polymerase, which lacks 5′
→ 3′ exonuclease activity, thereby ensuring that extension
halts at the 5′ end of the second hybridization site, where
ligation is to occur. We took care to design MIPs that are predicted
to exhibit minimal secondary structure—especially in the anchor
sites—to ensure highly efficient circularization. We established
a threshold for secondary structure energetics based on the ΔGfolding for which the conversion from linear
to circular DNA is >90% after five temperature cycles. In order
to
achieve efficient circularization, we estimate that any secondary
structure involving an anchor site must have ΔGfolding ≥ −0.33kcal/mol (Calculation S1). Prior
works that did not consider this aspect of MIP design used 99 cycles
of melting, annealing, extension, and ligation to achieve circularization,17 whereas we are consistently able to obtain complete
conversion to circular product in just five cycles. After ligation,
we incubate the reaction with a mixture of exonucleases I and III
to degrade any remaining linear single- or double-stranded DNA while
leaving circular DNA intact. We note that this combination of circularization
and degradation results in excellent specificity, allowing us to efficiently
isolate and purify target amplicons even in a large background of
nonspecific byproducts of PCR amplification (Figure S1).

Figure 1 Sequencing ultrashort reads on the MinION. (a) (1) Molecular inversion
probes (MIPs) anneal adjacent to the target sequence (blue) at anchor
site 1 (AS1, orange) and anchor site 2 (AS2, green). Phusion polymerase
copies the target sequence into the MIP; the lack of 5′ →
3′ exonuclease activity ensures that extension halts when the
polymerase reaches AS2. (2) Ampligase ligates the extended template
to the phosphorylated 5′ end of the MIP, generating circular
ssDNA. Linear ss- or dsDNA fragments are degraded by a combination
of exonuclease I and exonuclease III. (3) The circular DNA is subjected
to RCA to generate tandem repeats of the original target, yielding
ultralong, concatemerized ssDNA. (4) The RCA product is converted
to dsDNA with Taq polymerase and subjected to ONT library preparation.
(5) Sequencing reads are collected from a new MinION R9.4 flow-cell
run for 24 h. (b) The raw sequences are compiled and analyzed. The
identified repeats have poor accuracy in isolation, but since the
sequencing errors vary across repeats, they can be aligned together
to produce a high-fidelity consensus sequence.

We then initiate RCA18 on the
circular
product with the strand-displacing polymerase φ29, which generates
long single-stranded concatemers (>1000 kb) of the complement to
the
circular template. Shorter template circles with commensurately smaller
target sequence inserts are generally advantageous here, as they can
generate more repeats within a fixed RCA length, which in turn positively
impacts the accuracy of the resulting computational alignment. There
are certain limitations, including the fact that the ring strain in
very small DNA circles can cause φ29 to dissociate prematurely.19 However, since the MIP itself is 102 nt, HiFRe
circumvents this limitation and can target inserts as short as a single
nucleotide (Figure 2, lane 2). The ssDNA generated by the RCA reaction is incompatible
with the dsDNA required by the MinION library preparation protocol.
We therefore implement a brief secondary amplification with Taq polymerase
to generate the required starting material of ∼1 μg dsDNA.
The presence of multiple primer sequences within the concatamer creates
opportunities for laddering and shortening in the amplification product
pool. We exploit the 5′ → 3′ exonuclease capacity
of Taq polymerase to overcome this problem: any sequences that are
undesirably primed from an internal primer-binding site are likely
to be degraded by the exonucleolytic activity of an upstream Taq enzyme,
greatly favoring the synthesis of full-length products. Finally, the
dsDNA products are prepared for sequencing via ONT’s standard
1D amplicon by ligation kit and sequenced on a R9.4 flow cell. The
tandem repeats identified from the raw reads are then used to computationally
reconstruct the original sequence (Figure 1b).

Figure 2 Circularization can be performed on target sequences
as short as
a single nucleotide with reaction efficiency that is independent of
target sequence length. After five rounds of temperature cycling and
subsequent exonuclease treatment, we achieve consistently efficient
circularization for target sequences ranging in length from 1 to 120
nt (lanes 2–8). In this denaturing gel, lane 1 contains a mixture
of all the linear ssDNA target sequences. The lengths listed are the
lengths of the target region; the full lengths in lane 1 have additional
flanking 28- and 23-nt anchor sites, and the full lengths in lanes
2–8 have an additional 102 nt from the MIP. Lane 9 illustrates
that no circular DNA is produced in the absence of the target sequence.

HiFRe Enables Accurate MinION Sequencing
of Ultrashort DNA Sequences
(<100 bp)
To demonstrate the generalizability of this
approach, we first performed our circularization procedure on a variety
of sequences with target lengths ranging from 1 to 120 bp. We found
that all of the tested sequences were targeted and circularized with
high efficiency, using the same 102 bp MIP design for each target.
The observation that high circularization efficiency is preserved
independent of the tested target length (Figure 2) illustrates the generalizability of this
approach over a range of ultrashort sequence lengths.

In order
to further explore the performance and capabilities of our HiFRe method,
we subjected a 52 bp target sequence (Table 1) to the entire workflow, including sequencing
and data analysis. We circularized our target sequence with a 102
nt MIP, yielding an RCA product with a repeat length of 154 bases.
To account for potential sequence-induced biases that could arise
from using a single test sequence, we incorporated two randomized
N10 regions at the ends of the 52 bp target sequence, adjacent
to the anchor sites. Notably, the rest of the workflow can be adapted
to any other assay that also results in a circular DNA output, such
as MiR-ID20 or cPLA.21

target sequences, orange and green represent universal anchor sites

Bases in red indicate the three SNVs that were introduced into Target
#2. The barcode in the MIP sequences is a 12 nt region that allows
for multiplexing in a single nanopore run. Barcode sequences are listed
in Table S1.

The resulting consensus reads achieved excellent accuracy
despite
the short length of the original template. In general, short reads
are less tolerant of errors than long sequences in terms of sequence
identity. For example, an E. coli genome sequence
with a 20% error rate will be accurately identified as E.
coli since there are still millions of accurately sequenced
bases and the sequence space is very sparse. Alternatively, a 20-bp
miRNA with a 20% error rate has a high probability of being misidentified
as a completely different miRNA, as the sequence space is far more
dense.22 Therefore, we developed a computational
algorithm to process the data from HiFRe, identify tandem repeats
in the raw base-called reads, and reconstruct the original sequence.
The source code for this algorithm is publicly available on GitHub
(see Methods).

A representative alignment illustrates the utility
of using individual
tandem repeats to reconstruct an accurate consensus sequence (Figure 3a). In order to recover
the individual repeats, the algorithm scans the raw base-called reads
for regions that map to the RCA initiator. These individual repeats
are compared to the initial target sequence in order to define the
average unmapped accuracy (Figure 3b, gray). Using a progressive multiple alignment algorithm,
we then generate a consensus sequence from the ensemble of consecutive
repeats. The consensus sequence is compared to the original target
sequence to define the postalignment accuracy (Figure 3b, red). We observed marked improvement in
the alignment scores after consensus sequence generation, with the
median alignment score increasing from 0.65 to 0.87 after alignment.
It should be noted that we applied the algorithm to any read that had more than three identifiable repeats, regardless of
the quality score or pass/fail designation reported by the MinKNOW
software—in stark contrast to previous methods that only consider
high-quality, passing reads.11

Figure 3 Improving read
accuracy through repeat-based consensus. (a) Representative
consensus sequence generation. A single, base-called read is split
into its individual repeats. These repeats are aligned with each other
to generate a consensus sequence via a winner-take-all base-calling
strategy. Gaps are removed and the consensus sequence is then compared
back to the original sequence to assess the postalignment accuracy.
(b) Histogram of alignment scores before (gray) and after (red) consensus
sequence generation. The “before” alignment score is
an average over the alignment scores of all the repeats found within
a single raw read. Data includes all reads with more than three identified
repeats, regardless of the quality score or pass/fail designation
of the MinION software.

As anticipated, we found that the improvement in alignment
is a
strong function of the number of tandem repeats used to generate the
consensus sequence (Figure 4). Contrary to previous reports that show a plateau in accuracy
at 15 repeats,11 we found that we could
achieve significant increases in accuracy with up to 29 repeats. The
average normalized Smith-Waterman alignment score increased from 0.74
± 0.13 to 0.95 ± 0.04 going from 4 to 29 aligned repeats,
as opposed to the average alignment score of 0.57 ± 0.14 for
unaligned repeats. Additional gains may be possible beyond 29 repeats,
but the read depth at these lengths was too low to determine the statistical
significance of any further increases in accuracy. Improvements to
the RCA protocol23 could enable the production
of higher fractions of longer concatemers, and therefore yield an
even more pronounced increase in overall accuracy. Additionally, we
observed that the standard deviation of the alignment score also decreases
with greater numbers of repeats (Figure 4), yielding alignments that are both more
accurate and more precise.

Figure 4 Increased accuracy from alignment of tandem
repeats. Plots show
normalized Smith-Waterman alignment scores as a function of the number
of repeats before (gray) and after (red) alignment. Before consensus
sequence generation, alignment score exhibits no dependence on repeat
count. Since each “before point” represents an average
over all repeats in that read, the observed narrowing arises solely
because the increased number of repeats decreases the standard deviation
of the average alignment score. After the consensus sequence is generated,
the alignment accuracy exhibits a strong dependence on the number
of repeats used.

HiFRe Enables Quantitative
Discrimination of Sequence Variants
Our method is also quantitative,
enabling ratiometric quantification
of different target sequences. This is useful for many sequencing-based
assays, such as transcriptome analysis,24 miRNA profiling,25,26 and cell-free DNA detection.4 Most uses of nanopore sequencing to date have
generally not explored molecular counting, except for quantifying
chromosome copy number for aneuploidy detection.6 RNA-seq can be performed with the nanopore system,27,28 but this application is still in the nascent stages of commercial
development. We have found that HiFRe can accurately quantify input
ratios of two target sequences ranging from 0 to 90% with an R2 of 0.993 (Figure 5a), yielding a limit of detection29 of 3.3 ± 2.1%. This strong linear relationship between input
and output abundances illustrates the power of HiFRe for quantifying
relative abundances of multiple sequences.

Figure 5 Quantitative analysis
with HiFRe. a) Counting relative molecular
abundance for two sequences present in mixtures at different ratios.
A linear fit to y = mx + b yielded m = 0.97 ± 0.04 and b = 0.02 ± 0.02 with R2 = 0.993. This strong linear relationship results in a limit of detection
of 3.3 ± 2.1%. b) Discrimination and quantitation of SNVs in
short DNA sequences. Two sequences differing by three SNVs were mixed
together in different ratios, and the plot shows the output ratios
recovered after HiFRe analysis. Green bars represent the fraction
of the original sequence and yellow bars show the sequence with three
SNVs. In both panels, the error bars represent the standard deviation
for the mean of two multiplexed sequencing runs.

This discriminatory power is important, as many clinical
applications
of DNA sequencing involve resolving the relative abundance of sequences
with single-nucleotide differences—for example, the detection
of cancerous mutations in cell-free DNA4 or the analysis
of closely related miRNA families.25,26 Until recently,
SNV resolution on nanopore-based platforms has required either extremely
high read depth or cosequencing with another sequencing method. HiFRe
now enables the resolution of SNVs from single reads within a standard
MinION experimental workflow. To demonstrate this, we mixed together
two 52 bp test sequences that were identical apart from three nucleotides
(Table 1). Using HiFRe,
we were able to accurately resolve the representation of the two sequences
for all three SNVs at a variety of different input ratios (Figure 5b). Although we tested
three different SNVs (G → C, A → T, C → G) to
account for potential biases in nanopore base-calling errors,30 we observed no impact on sequence discrimination
from these individual SNVs. We note that some SNVs not tested in this
work are particularly challenging to detect via nanopore. For example,
A[G/C/T]A versus AAA would be difficult to quantify due to the nanopore
platform’s propensity to introduce deletions when reading homopolymers
of As. However, future iterations of the HiFRe algorithm could be
designed to account for these biases.

Conclusions
HiFRe
offers a simple and straightforward strategy for the accurate
nanopore sequencing of ultrashort sequences (<100 bp). This method
deploys RCA on a MIP-circularized template to generate long concatemers
that can readily be sequenced on the MinION platform. Each raw read
contains numerous repeats of the original target sequence that can
be computationally aligned to generate a highly accurate consensus
sequence. Using a 52 bp target sequence, we demonstrate over multiple
experiments that the accuracy of this method is sufficiently high
to enable relative molecular counting and SNV resolution, resulting
in accurate ratiometric quantification of DNA sequences that are present
at input ratios below 10%. With the added ability to analyze short
targets, nanopore sequencing can be used not only for genomic analysis
but also as a readout for the many bioassays that feature the production
of short DNA oligonucleotides as an output, such as PLA,31 PLAYR,32 and AbSeq.33 Ultimately, assays that previously required
a fully equipped laboratory and a desktop sequencer could potentially
be performed at a fraction of the cost in a portable format, greatly
expanding their utility and accessibility, especially in resource-limited
settings.
