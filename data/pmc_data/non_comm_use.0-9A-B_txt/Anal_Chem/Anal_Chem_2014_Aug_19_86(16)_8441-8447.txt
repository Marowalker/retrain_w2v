Two
immuno-loop-mediated isothermal amplification assays (iLAMP) were
developed by using a phage-borne peptide that was isolated from a
cyclic eight-peptide phage library. One assay was used to screen eight
organophosphorus (OP) pesticides with limits of detection (LOD) between
2 and 128 ng mL–1. The iLAMP consisted of the competitive
immuno-reaction coupled to the LAMP reaction for detection. This method
provides positive results in the visual color of violet, while a negative
response results in a sky blue color; therefore, the iLAMP allows
one to rapidly detect analytes in yes or no fashion. We validated
the iLAMP by detecting parathion-methyl, parathion, and fenitrothion
in Chinese cabbage, apple, and greengrocery, and the detection results
were consistent with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
In conclusion, the iLAMP is a simple, rapid, sensitive, and economical
method for detecting OP pesticide residues in agro-products with no
instrumental requirement.

==== Body
Introduction
Organophosphorus (OP) pesticides are widely
used in agriculture for the control of sucking and biting insects,
including fruit flies, stem borers, mosquitoes, and cereal bugs. However,
OP pesticides are considered hazardous substances because of their
toxicity to nontarget species and periodic persistence problems in
the environment.1 Therefore, it is important
to develop a rapid, sensitive, and economical method for detecting
OP pesticides and their residues in food and the environment.

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a novel nucleic
acid amplification method that amplifies DNA with high specificity,
sensitivity, and rapidity under isothermal conditions using a set
of four specially designed primers and a DNA polymerase with strand
displacement activity.2 The LAMP method
has three main advantages. First, all reactions can be specifically
carried out under isothermal conditions, and do not require a denatured
DNA template. Compared to conventional PCR and real-time PCR assays,
specialized and/or expensive equipment is not necessary, and there
are fewer preparation steps.3,4 Second, the amplification
efficiency is extremely high so that high amounts of amplification
products can be obtained.5 Third, LAMP
results can be read by the naked eye, on the basis of the change of
turbidity.6 Alternatively, the LAMP products
can be visualized by small molecules such as fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC), hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB), and digoxigenin (DIG).7,8 Since the first description of the LAMP method in 2000,9 many LAMP assays have been developed for detection
of pathogenic microorganisms,10,11 genetically modified
ingredients,12,13 tumor detection,14,15 and embryo sex identification.16,17 However, no
investigator has reported a LAMP assay for the detection of pesticides
since most pesticides are low-molecular weight chemical compounds
and do not contain nucleic acids. That LAMP technology likely was
overlooked in the environmental field should be quite a concern.

Since phage peptide display was first reported,18 it has been a powerful tool for a variety of applications,
including the isolation of peptide ligands for antibodies and enzymes,19−21 antibody engineering,22,23 and the isolation of
receptor peptides for small molecules.24,25 A phage display
random peptide library, which displays extensive random peptides on
the N terminus of the minor coat protein g3p of the filamentous phage
M13, can be used for this purpose. Peptides with specific affinities
or activities toward targets can be screened from the peptide library.26−28 Phage g3p-displayed short peptide libraries have been approved to
be efficient tools for selecting mimotope peptides of an array of
compounds, including metabolites of pyrethroid insecticides,29 deoxynivalenol,30 zearalenone,31 ochratoxin A (OTA),32 and aflatoxin.33,34 The unique
characteristics of a phage-borne peptide that connects the peptide
with affinity to a target on the phage particles containing nucleic
acids (single-stranded DNA) encoding the peptide make them excellent
reagents to develop LAMP assays for small molecules.

To test
this feasibility, we isolated four phage-borne peptides with specific
affinities to a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against OP pesticides. This
study describes our systemic approach to the development of the iLAMP
using one phage-borne peptide with the highest sensitivity and validating
the assay with application to several agricultural samples.

Materials
and Methods
Reagents
All reagents were of analytical grade unless
specified otherwise. Parathion-methyl, chlorpyrifos-methyl, azinphos-methyl,
dimethoate, fenitrooxon, EPN, paraoxon-ethyl, paraoxon-methyl, dicapthon,
cyanophos, and famphur were all purchased from Dr. Ehrenstorfer (Germany).
Other pesticide standards were provided by the Jiangsu Pesticide Research
Institute (China). Anti-OP pesticide mAb C8/D3 was produced in our
laboratory.35 Mouse anti-M13 monoclonal
antibody–horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate was purchased
from GE Health Care (Piscataway, NJ, U.S.A.). Bst DNA polymerase and Escherichia coli ER2738 were
purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA, U.S.A.). The cyclic
8-amino-acid random peptide library was developed in the laboratory
(UC Davis, CA, U.S.A.) previously.34 Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG), 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside (Xgal), betaine, and hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB)
were purchased from Sigma (U.S.A.). MgCl2 and dNTPs were
purchased from Takara (Japan). Double-distilled water was used in
all experiments.

Phage Selection by Biopanning
Three
wells of one microtiter plate were coated with purified C8/D3 mAb
(10 μg mL–1) in 100 μL of phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) by overnight incubation 4 °C. Nonspecific binding
was blocked by incubation with 300 μL of PBS containing 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. To eliminate nonspecific
binding of the phage to BSA, another plate coated with 100 μL
of 3% BSA in PBS was used for preabsorption. For the panning–elution
procedure, the phage library (1 × 1010 pfu mL–1) diluted with PBS was first added to the preabsorption
plate and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Then, the supernatant was
transferred to the plate coated with C8/D3 and incubated with shaking
at room temperature for 1 h. The wells were washed 10 times with PBS
containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST). To elute the bound phage using
competitive elution, 100 μL of parathion-methyl (100 ng mL–1 in PBS) was added to each well with shaking for 1
h to compete with the binding phage from the coating antibody. Alternatively,
100 μL of 0.2 M glycine-HCl (pH 2.2, acidic elution) and 1 mg
mL–1 BSA was added with gentle rocking for no more
than 20 min and then neutralized with 15 μL of 1 M Tris-HCl
(pH 9.1). The elution solution was then collected and used to infect Escherichia coli ER2738 for amplification and titration.
The amplified phage was used for a subsequent round of panning. In
the second and third rounds of panning, the concentration of coating
antibody was reduced to 5 and 1 μg mL–1, while
the elution buffer was 10 and 1 ng mL–1 parathion-methyl,
respectively. After three rounds of panning–elution selection,
individual plaques were picked up from LB/IPTG/Xgal plates and tested
for their ability to bind to the mAb by phage ELISA. Positive clones
were further selected by titration and submitted for DNA sequencing
using the primer 96gIII (CCCTCATAGTTAGCGTAACG) (Division of Biological
Sciences, Automated DNA Sequencing Facility, University of California,
Davis).

Screening of Phage Eluate by Phage ELISA
After three
rounds of panning, 180 μL of ER2738 cell culture (mid log phase,
OD600 = 0.5 AU) was resuspended with 10 μL of diluted
phage eluates. Then, the infected cells were transferred to culture
tubes containing 45 °C top agar and poured on a LB/IPTG/Xgal
plate. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C. A total
of 20 clones were picked, transferred to diluted ER2738 culture and
grown at 37 °C with shaking for 4.5 h. Cells were pelleted by
centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were
collected for phage ELISA. To select the positive clones, a microtiter
plate was coated with C8/D3 mAb and blocked as described above for
panning–elution selection. Fifty microliters of phage supernatant
of each clone was mixed with 50 μL of 100 ng mL–1 parathion-methyl in 10% methanol–PBS or pure dilution buffer.
The mixtures were added to the wells, and the preparations were incubated
at room temperature for 1 h with shaking. After the wells were washed
six times with 0.1% PBST, 100 μL of anti-M13 phage antibody
conjugated with HRP (1:5000 dilution in PBS) was added. After 1 h
incubation and washing six times, the amount of bound enzyme was determined
by adding 100 μL of peroxidase substrate (25 mL of 0.1 M citrate
acetate buffer (pH 5.5), 0.4 mL of 6 mgmL–1 TMB
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and 0.1 mL of 1% H2O2). The absorbance at 450 nm was determined after the reaction
was stopped by adding 50 μL of 2 M H2SO4 per well.

Primer Design
The specific LAMP
primers based on the nucleotide sequence of phage were designed for
detection of the phage-borne peptide by using Primer Explorer V4 (http://primerexplorer.jp/elamp4.0.0/index.html), an online
primer-designing tool developed by Eiken Chemical Co. LTD, Japan.

LAMP Reaction
The LAMP reacted in a 25 μL volume containing
1.2 μM each of FIP and BIP, 0.2 μM of F3 and B3, 0.64
M betaine, 1 mM dNTPs, 3 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 8.8), 10 mM KCl, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 8 U of Bst DNA polymerase, 150 μM
HNB, and 1 μL of target DNA. The reaction was performed in 0.2
mL microcentrifuge tubes that were placed in a water bath or turbidimeter
(LA-320C, Japanese Eiken Chemical Co. Ltd.) for 1 h at 63 °C,
and the reaction was terminated by treatment at 80 °C for 10
min. A positive control (a sample known to contain the phage) and
a negative control (a sample to which no template was added) were
included in each run. The visualization indicator HNB was added to
the reaction mixture before amplification. HNB produced a distinctive
color if the reaction was positive; as a consequence, the iLAMP result
could be observed by the naked eye without gel electrophoresis. When
the LAMP reaction was completed, the color of the mixture in the tubes
containing detectable amounts of phage changed from violet to sky
blue, and the turbidity of the mixture increased. For confirmation
of the LAMP assessment based on HNB-visualized color and turbidity
change, 3 μL of each LAMP mixture was then subjected to 2.0%
agarose gel electrophoresis, and the gels were stained with ethidium
bromide.

Sensitivity and Specificity of the LAMP Reaction
The
phage C11-2 (1.7 × 1011 pfu mL–1) was serially diluted (from 2 × 106 to 109 times) and analyzed by the LAMP to evaluate the sensitivity of the
LAMP. Specificity of the LAMP was determined by performing the assay
with helper phage M13K07 (2 × 106 pfu mL–1, New England Biolabs) and M13KE vector (1 mg μL–1, New England Biolabs). When the reactions were complete, the LAMP
products were observed by naked eye and gel electrophoresis. There
were three replications for each sample, and the experiment was performed
three times.

iLAMP Method
Two iLAMP methods consisting
of the competitive immunoreaction and the LAMP reaction were carried
out in this study (Figure 1). In the first
method, a microtiter plate was coated with C8/D3 mAb (10 μg
mL–1) in 100 μL of PBS by incubating for 2
h at 37 °C. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with
300 μL of PBS containing 3% BSA for 1.5 h at 37 °C. The
phage (8.5 × 107 pfu mL–1) in 100
μL of PBS was added into the plate and incubated 37 °C
for 1 h. The plate was washed six times with PBST, and 300 μL
of PBS was added for 1 h at 37 °C. Then, the plate was washed
eight times with PBST, and 100 μL of analyte was added for 1
h at 37 °C to compete with the binding phage from the coating
antibody. After incubating, the supernatant was diluted 20-fold by
double-distilled water, and 2 μL of the diluted supernatant
was detected by LAMP. In this method, the sky blue color development
(the color of the mixture in the tubes changed from violet to sky
blue) represented the positive results.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of
phage iLAMP.

In the second method,
the plate was coated and blocked as the first method. Aliquots of
50 μL per well of analyte and 50 μL per well of the phage
(1.7 × 108 pfu mL–1) dissolved in
PBS were added to the blocked plate. After incubating for 1 h at 37
°C, the plate was washed eight times with PBST and 100 μL
of parathion-methyl (100 ng mL–1 in PBS) was added
for 1 h at 37 °C to compete with the binding phage from the
coating antibody. Then, the supernatant was diluted 5-fold by double-distilled
water, and 2 μL of the diluted supernatant was detected by LAMP.
In contrast to the first method, the color remaining violet represented
the positive results in this method.

Sensitivity and Selectivity
of the ILAMP
A series of concentrations (0.05–10,000
ng mL–1) of 23 analyte standards were prepared in
10% methanol–PBS and tested using the iLAMP; after 60 min the
results were judged by the naked eye and turbidimeter. To evaluate
the selectivity of the iLAMP, cross-reactivity (CR) was calculated
on the basis of the limit of detection (LOD), the formula being as
follows: CR = [LOD (parathion-methyl)/LOD (compound)] × 100%.
Here, the CR of parathion-methyl was defined as 100%.

Accuracy (Analysis
of Spiked Agricultural Samples)
Three different agricultural
samples (Chinese cabbage, apple, and greengrocery) were chosen to
evaluate the performance of the iLAMP. Chinese cabbage, apple, and
greengrocery (organic) were purchased from local markets. Before the
spiking and recovery study, each test sample was verified for no parathion-methyl,
parathion, and fenitrothion in the tested samples by gas chromatography
(limit of quantification was 40 ng g–1). All of
the samples were spiked with known concentrations of parathion-methyl,
parathion, and fenitrothion in methanol (the final concentrations
were 0 LOD × dilution times, and 2-fold of LOD × dilution
times). Each test was done in triplicate.

All samples were cut
into pieces and homogenized. The spiked samples were thoroughly mixed
and allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 h. The sample pretreatment
procedure was as follows. All samples (5 g) were extracted twice by
a vortex mixer in 10 mL of methanol for 1 min and centrifuged for
5 min at 4000 rpm. After centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred
into a 25 mL volumetric flask, and adjusted to 25 mL with PBS. After
dilution at an appropriate multiple, the solutions were analyzed via
the iLAMP.

Results and Discussion
Panning–Elution
Selection of Specific Phages
After three rounds of panning,
randomly chosen clones (20 clones) were analyzed by phage ELISA in
the presence (100 ng mL–1) or absence of parathion-methyl
(Figure 2). Eleven clones out of 20 showed
significant differences in signal with or without parathion-methyl
in the assay. Phage single-stranded DNA from the positive clones was
isolated, and the nucleotide sequence of each of them was determined.
Only four different sequences (designated as C1-1, C3-3, C5-5, C11-2)
were identified (Table 1), and they showed
the consensus peptide sequence “-PWP-RP-”. Additionally,
each amino acid sequence of the mimotope peptides contained four or
more proline (P); thus, proline appears to be a crucial amino acid
of the mimotope peptides.

Primers
The specific LAMP primers based on the nucleotide
sequence of C11-2 (Figure 3A) with the highest
sensitivity for phage ELISA were designed by using Primer Explorer
V4. The structure of the LAMP primers and their complementarity to
target DNA used in this study are shown in Figure 3B. A forward inner primer (FIP) consisted of the complementary
sequence of F1 (F1c) and F2, and a backward inner primer (BIP) consisted
of B1c and B2. The outer primers F3 and B3 are required for initiation
of the LAMP reaction.

of F1 (F1c) and F2, and a backward inner primer (BIP) consisted of

of the LAMP reaction.

Sensitivity and Specificity of the LAMP
The limit of detection
of LAMP for C11-2 was 8.5 × 103 pfu mL–1 whether detection involved HNB (Figure 4A)
or gel electrophoresis (Figure 4B). No positive
DNA products were observed when helper phage M13K07 and M13KE vector
were used as templates (Figure 4C,D). In this
study, the LAMP reaction was the signal used to judge the result of
the analysis. Therefore, the sensitivity and specificity of the LAMP
reaction itself are significant parameters for development of the
iLAMP. Comparing the titer of the supernatant (detected by LAMP reaction
in iLAMP assay), the sensitivity of the LAMP was adequate for developing
the iLAMP (Table 2). The LOD (the mean OD450 of control plus 3 standard deviations) of the ELISA (phage
ELISA without parathion-methyl) detecting C11-2 was 1.2 × 107 pfu mL–1 (Figure 5), which was 1400-fold higher than that of the LAMP reaction. In
competitive immunoassay, analyte was generally detected by indirect
screening of the competitor, so that this result indicated the LAMP
reaction had the ability to develop a highly sensitive iLAMP. The
specificity of the LAMP reaction indicated the iLAMP was not affected
by the DNA template in the sample and environment.

Figure 5 ELISA for phage C11-2. The LOD was calculated
as the mean of negative OD450 (0.137) plus 3 standard deviations
(3 × 0.008), which was at 0.161 (n = 3).

Comparison of the Two ILAMP
Methods
In three repetitions, the LODs of the first iLAMP
method were 0.5, 0.5, and 1 ng mL–1, respectively.
The LOD of the second iLAMP method was consistently 2 ng mL–1 (Figure 6). Comparing the two iLAMP methods,
the first method appeared to be more sensitive than the second method,
but the variable LOD values of the first one was somewhat unsatisfactory.
The titers of the supernatant (detected by LAMP reaction in iLAMP)
were detected in order to explain the phenomenon (Table 2). Table 2 shows the difference in
phage titer at different concentrations of parathion-methyl was not
significant by the first method, with the maximal signal at the highest
concentration 4.3 times higher than the lowest concentration. In contrast,
the titer has considerable difference in second method, showing the
maximal signal at 8 ng mL–1 52.9 times higher than
that at 0 ng mL–1, resulting in much higher signal-to-noise
ratio by the second method. This was the reason for the different
stability between the two methods. Besides, the reason for the variable
titer between the two methods can be in part explained by the assay
protocols. In the first method, the steps of competing and eluting
were completed in a single step by adding analyte in PBS for 1 h at
37 °C to elute the bound phage from the coating antibody. In the second
method those steps were completed separately by adding analyte and
phage together and eluting with 100 μL of parathion-methyl.
Since the second method was more reproducible, it was used for the
next study.

Sensitivity and Selectivity of the ILAMP (Second Method)
In total, 23 OP pesticides were evaluated using the iLAMP, and the
results are presented in Table 3. The LOD ranged
from 2 to 128 ng mL–1 for the eight OP pesticides
(parathion-methyl, parathion, fenitrothion, EPN, cyanophos, paraoxon-methyl,
paraoxon-ethyl, and fenitrooxon). The sensitivity of the iLAMP was
higher than a previous qualitative immunoassay (immunochromatographic
assay, ICA).35 The eight OP pesticides
were the main cross reactants, and the CRs for the iLAMP were similar
to those from the ELISA and ICA.35 Therefore,
the developed iLAMP was selective for the eight OP pesticides.

Analysis of Spiked Samples
During the iLAMP, the matrix interference was adequately removed
from the Chinese cabbage, apple, and greengrocery samples with at
least a 40-fold dilution. Each sample was spiked with parathion-methyl,
parathion, and fenitrothion at different concentrations (0, LOD ×
40, and LOD × 80) and determined by using the developed iLAMP
assay. Each test was done in triplicate. The color of the mixture
in the tube was sky blue for all the samples containing no analytes,
and the color was violet for the spiked samples (Table 4). In this study, the spiked samples were detected by the
ELISA35 that was established with the same
antibodies to validate the novel iLAMP. The spiked recoveries of the
ELISA were between 76.3% and 112.6%, and all of the coefficient of
variation (CV) were less than or equal to 16.3% (Table 4). The results show the iLAMP and ELISA yielded comparable
results. These results demonstrated that the iLAMP assay has high
accuracy and reproducibility for detecting OP pesticides in agricultural
products.

Conclusions
This
work presents the development of a novel iLAMP assay to detect various
OP pesticides in agricultural samples. Utilizing the phage display
technology, the LAMP assay was successfully developed to analyze small-molecular
weight pesticides with no DNA strand for amplification by the LAMP.
The LODs of the developed iLAMP ranged from 2 to 128 ng mL–1 depending on the type of OP pesticide. The recovery test with spiked
agricultural products indicated the iLAMP was a suitable method for
the detection of many OP pesticides in agricultural samples. The phage-borne
peptide could be used as a competitor directly, and its single-stranded
DNA was a native template for amplification. The amplification of
phage DNA by the LAMP was extremely efficient with no instrumental
requirement. This study demonstrates that phage-borne peptide mimotopes
could be an excellent secondary reagent to develop a novel iLAMP with
higher sensitivity for the detection of small molecules. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first time that the iLAMP assay has
been applied in the detection of compounds in general and for OP pesticides.
