Cross-linking
mass spectrometry has become an important approach
for studying protein structures and protein–protein interactions.
The amino acid compositions of some protein regions impede the detection
of cross-linked residues, although it would yield invaluable information
for protein modeling. Here, we report on a sequential-digestion strategy
with trypsin and elastase to penetrate regions with a low density
of trypsin-cleavage sites. We exploited intrinsic substrate-recognition
properties of elastase to specifically target larger tryptic peptides.
Our application of this protocol to the TAF4–12 complex allowed
us to identify cross-links in previously inaccessible regions.

==== Body
Trypsin is
the enzyme of choice
in mass-spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. The favorable behavior
of tryptic peptides during mass-spectrometric analysis is one of the main reasons for this.1,2 However, as trypsin cleaves after Arg and Lys, peptides generated
in protein regions with a low Arg and Lys densities are very long,
making them potentially nonobservable by mass spectrometry and thus
resulting in poor coverage of those regions.

This problem is
particularly relevant for cross-linking mass spectrometry
(CLMS). In CLMS, protein proximities and conformations are preserved
through the introduction of covalent bonds. The detection of these
bonds as cross-linked peptide pairs by MS is translated into distance
constraints.3−7 Currently, the most frequently used cross-linkers are N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters that primarily target the ε-amino
groups of Lys residues and to a lesser extent also react with the
hydroxyl groups of Ser, Thr, and Tyr.8,9 CLMS critically
depends on good sequence coverage to reveal structural information
for the whole protein. Cross-linking naturally involves two peptides,
which aggravates the problem of overly large peptides. This is exacerbated
when the cross-linker reacts with two lysine residues as two potential
cleavage sites for trypsin are removed. The stabilization of proteins
through cross-linking and the destruction of potential trypsin-cleavage
sites may further affect the efficiency of trypsin digestion and lead
to an increase in missed cleavages.

Alternative proteases to
trypsin target basic (LysC and ArgC),
acidic (AspN and GluC), or aromatic (chymotrypsin) amino acids.10,11 Although usage of these proteases improves sequence coverage12,13 and has been used in parallel to usage of trypsin to enhance identification
of cross-linked residues,14,15 some protein regions,
such as the N-terminal region of TAF4, a subunit of transcriptional
factor II D, still cannot be accessed (Figure 1). The existence of TAF4b, a cell-type-specific
TAF4 paralogue with a unique N-terminal region, points to important
functions and interactions mediated through the N-terminal region
of TAF4.16 Cross-linked residues in this
region would therefore provide important information on the function
and structure of TAF4.

Figure 1 Theoretical cleavage sites in TAF4.

Proteases with broader specificity, like elastase, proteinase
K,
and pepsin, have the potential of complementing more selective proteases
and indeed have been used in membrane proteomics17,18 to detect phosphorylation sites19 and
even in CLMS20 with varying levels of success.
Elastase, for example, cleaves after Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Ser, and
Thr17 and should be able to cleave the
N-terminal region of TAF4 at many sites (Figure 1). This broad specificity leads to two potential
problems. If cleavage is complete, the resulting peptides would be
very small. However, cleavage of elastase is not expected to be complete.
Analyses of elastase efficiency on peptides with varying length revealed
elastase to have an extended substrate-binding region.21,22 Short peptides that do not cover the complete substrate-binding
region are less efficiently cleaved by elastase. Although this addresses
the potential problem of peptide length, it leads to another problem.
Having many missed cleavage sites leads elastase to generate very
complex mixtures with often overlapping peptides.17 This problem is exacerbated in cross-linked peptides, as
two peptides are involved, resulting in a combinatorial increase of
complexity. Recent work by our lab revealed a strong substrate preference
of proteases for longer peptides.15 As
a consequence, in a sequential digest, preferentially long peptides
are cleaved by the second protease, whereas short peptides remain
undigested. The complexity of an elastase digest might therefore be
vastly reduced by first using trypsin. Only long tryptic peptides
should be good substrates for elastase, whereas any sequence range
of a protein that is covered by short tryptic peptides would remain
unaffected by elastase treatment.

In this study, we investigate
the hypothesis whether the sequential
digestion of trypsin and elastase might positively impact the use
of elastase in CLMS. As a result, we detected cross-links in the difficult-to-digest
N-terminal region of TAF4.

Materials and Methods
Sample Preparation
The human TAF4–TAF12 complex
was coexpressed in Sf21 insect cells using the MultiBac system.23 DNA encoding an N-terminal hexa-histidine tag
and a protease-cleavage site for tobacco etch virus (TEV) NIa protease
was added to the 5′ end of the TAF4 open reading frame and
cloned into pFL plasmid along with TAF12. Baculovirus generation,
cell-culture infection, and protein production were carried out following
published protocols.24 Cell pellets were
resuspended in Talon Buffer A (25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM
imidazole, and complete protease inhibitor; Roche Molecular Biochemicals).
Cells were lysed by freeze–thawing (twice), followed by centrifugation
at 40 000g in a Ti70 rotor for 60 min to clear
the lysate. The TAF4–TAF12 complex was first bound to talon
resin and pre-equilibrated with Talon Buffer A; this was followed
by washes with Talon Buffer A, then with Talon Buffer HS (25 mM Tris
pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, and complete protease inhibitor),
and then again with Talon Buffer A. The TAF4–TAF12 complex
was eluted using Talon Buffer B (25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 200
mM imidazole, and complete protease inhibitor). Fractions containing
the TAF4–TAF12 complex were dialyzed overnight against MonoQ
Buffer A (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and complete
protease inhibitor). The complex was further purified using ion-exchange
chromatography (IEX) with a MonoQ column pre-equilibrated with MonoQ
Buffer A. After binding, the column was washed with MonoQ Buffer A,
and TAF4–TAF12 was eluted using a continuous, linear gradient
of MonoQ Buffer B (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1000 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and
complete protease inhibitor) from 0 to 100%. The complex was further
purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) with a SuperoseS6
10/300 column in SEC buffer (25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
DTT, and complete protease inhibitor).

TAF4–TAF12 (1.5
μg per condition) complexes were cross-linked with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate
(BS3) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at ratio of 1:1 (w/w) and incubated
on ice for 2 h. The mixture was incubated on ice for 1 h after saturated
bicarbonate (50 molar excess) was added to quench the reaction. Frozen Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells were ground, and 1 g of
yeast powder was resuspended in 2 mL of RIPA (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented
with cOmplete (Roche). Cell debris was moved via centrifugation at
1200g for 15 min. All samples were separated by SDS-PAGE
on a 4–12% Bis Tris gel (Life Technologies) and stained using
Imperial Protein Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Appropriate bands
were cut and proteins were first reduced with DTT and then alkylated
with iodoacetamide. Samples were incubated with trypsin (13 ng μL–1; Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific) or elastase (15
ng μL–1, Promega) at 37 °C for 16 h.
In the case of the elastase–trypsin digestion, trypsin (13
ng μL–1) was added to the overnight elastase
digest and incubated for 4 h at room temperature. For the sequential
trypsin–elastase digestion, elastase (15 ng μL–1) was added to the trypsin digest and incubated at 37 °C for
30 min. A comparison between 30 min and 4 h of digestion with elastase
showed no significant difference (data not shown). Following the digestion,
peptides were purified on C18 StageTips using standardized protocols.25

LC-MS/MS
TAF4–TAF12 complexes
were analyzed
on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and
yeast lysates were analyzed on an Orbitrap Elite (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Both were coupled online to an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano Systems (Dionex,
Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were loaded onto an EASY-Spray
LC Column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a flow rate of 0.300 μL
min–1 using 98% mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid)
and 2% mobile phase B (80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid). To elute
the peptides, the percentage of mobile phase B was first increased
to 40% over a time course of 110 min followed by a linear increase
to 95% in 11 min.

Full MS scans for yeast lysates were recorded
in the orbitrap at 120 000 resolution for MS1 with a scan range
of 300–1700 m/z. The 20 most
intense ions (precursor charge ≥2) were selected for fragmentation
by collision-induced disassociation, and MS2 spectra were recorded
in the ion trap (2.0 × 104 ions as a minimal required
signal, 35 normalized collision energy, dynamic exclusion for 40 s).
Both MS1 and MS2 were recorded in the orbitrap for the TAF4–TAF12
complexes (120 000 mass resolution for MS1 and 15 000
mass resolution for MS2, scan range 300–1700 m/z, dynamic exclusion for 60 s, precursor charge
≥3). Higher-energy collision dissociation was used to fragment
peptides (30% collision energy, 5.0 × 104 AGC target,
60 ms maximum injection time).

Data Analysis
MaxQuant software26 (version 1.5.2.8)
employing the Andromeda search engine27 was used to analyze the whole-cell lysates of S. Pombe. We used the PombeBase database28 with
carbamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed modification
and oxidation of methionine as a variable modification. MS accuracy
was set to 4.5 ppm and MS/MS tolerance to 20 ppm. For trypsin, we
allowed up to two miscleavages. Specificity of elastase was defined
as cleavage after Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Ser, and Thr but not before
Pro. Specificity for the trypsin and elastase digest was set to cleavage
after Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Ser, Thr, Arg, and Lys except if it was
followed by Pro. For all digests containing elastase, up to 10 miscleavages
were allowed. The peaklist for identification of cross-linked peptides
was generated using MS convert (ProteoWizard) for tryptic digests
with the following settings: peakPicking: 2–, msLevel: 2–,
MS2Denoise: 20 100, false or Maxquant version 1.6.2.3 with
default settings except increasing the “Top MS/MS peaks per
100 Da” to 100 for elastase-containing digests. Resulting MGF
or APL files were searched using Xi software15,29 version 1.6.731 with MS accuracy set to 4 ppm and MS/MS tolerance
set to 20 ppm. The only fixed modification was the carbamidomethylation
of cysteine. Variable modifications were the oxidation of methionine
and amidated and hydrolyzed BS3. The cross-linker was BS3 with Lys,
Ser, Thr, and Tyr as the only cross-linkable residues. Enzyme specificities
were the same as described for Mascot. Four miscleavages were allowed
for the trypsin digest, and 11 miscleavages were allowed for the other
digests. Two additional missing isotopes were allowed in the custom
settings. False-discovery rates (FDR) were estimated using xiFDR30 version 1.1.26.58 with 5% FDR at a peptide-pair
level for the TAF4–12 complex and 5% FDR at a peptide-pair
and -link level. Linear peptides of the cross-linked TAF4–12
complex were identified using Mascot software31 with carbamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed modification and
the following variable modifications: oxidation of methionine, hydrolyzed
BS3 (mass: 156.0786 Da), and amidated BS3 (mass: 155.0946 Da). Chromatograms
of MS1 were extracted, and peak areas were quantified using Skyline.32

In-Silico Digest
TheTAF4–TAF12
complex was digested
in-silico using trypsin, elastase or a combination of trypsin and
elastase. We assumed a complete digestion with no miscleavages for
the in-silico digestion and a minimum length of five amino acids.

Random Distribution
Random links were generated between
cross-linkable residues. The links were fitted into the crystal structure
of monomeric HSA (PDB: 1AO6) to calculate the distances.

Results and Discussion
Four different types of digestion, trypsin, elastase, sequential
trypsin–elastase, and sequential elastase–trypsin, were
applied to a cross-linked TAF4–TAF12 complex. We compared these
digests to assess the influence of substrate length on the cleavage
behavior of elastase. The peptide lengths of the observed tryptic
peptides without any modifications ranged from 5 to 65 amino acids,
which are very similar to the theoretical peptide-length distribution
(Figure 2a). However,
the median lengths of the peptides digested by elastase, trypsin–elastase,
and elastase–trypsin were considerably higher (12 amino acids)
than the predicted medians of 6 amino acids (Figure 2b–d). The majority of elastase-derived
peptides are larger than 5 amino acids, and the maximal length of
29 amino acids is considerably shorter than that of trypsin (65).
These observations are in line with previous studies on short peptides
reporting that the activity of elastase is dependent on the substrate
length N-terminal of the cleavage site.21,22 Our results
suggest that a similar restriction might also apply to longer peptides
and to the substrate length C-terminal from the cleavage site.

Notably fewer peptide-spectrum
matches (546 ± 74 PSM) were
identified following elastase digestion compared with those from peptides
digested by trypsin alone (869 ± 170 PSM), trypsin–elastase
(1116 ± 164 PSM), or elastase–trypsin (1111 ± 100
PSM, Figure 2e). One
possible explanation for the reduced identification of elastase peptides
could be the missing positive C-terminal charge that tryptic peptides
have. To this end, we analyzed semitryptic peptides, as they should
distribute equally among those featuring a tryptic C-terminus and
a tryptic N-terminus. Semitryptic peptides with tryptic C-termini
were identified more often (70 ± 2%), in agreement with a positive
C-terminal charge being beneficial for detection (Figure 2f). Another disadvantage of
elastase is that it frequently misses cleavage sites and overlapping
peptides lead to complex peptide mixtures. By digesting proteins with
trypsin first, the amount of available cleavage sites for elastase
might be reduced, as short tryptic peptides should be protected from
elastase because of their size. The products of digested small peptides
may not be identified, because of the identification bias against
small peptides that occurs in LC-MS/MS. To avoid this, we quantified
tryptic peptides before and after the addition of elastase. Peptides
that had been reduced by more than half were labeled as “reduced”.
The remaining peptides were categorized as “unchanged”.
Peptides were divided into three groups depending on their lengths
(≤12, 13–20, and >20). The number of reduced peptides,
19, 70, or 113 peptides, respectively, increased with peptide size
(Figure 2g). The label-free
quantification confirms that elastase preferentially digests long
peptides; thus, initial trypsin digestion reduces elastase-induced
complexity. Indeed, analyzing the 404–420 region in TAF4 revealed
that trypsin treatment protected this region from elastase digestion.
Consequently, the complexity within the sequential trypsin–elastase
digest was reduced compared with that of the digest from elastase
alone or elastase–trypsin (Figure 2h).

In the next step, we analyzed the
effect of our sequential trypsin–elastase
on the detection of cross-linked peptides. As a proof of principle,
we first analyzed BS3 cross-linked human-serum albumin (HSA). As expected,
the increase in complexity and the missing C-terminal charge associated
with elastase digestion adversely affected the identification of cross-linked
peptides. Although digestion of the BS3 cross-linked complexes with
trypsin allowed us to identify 152 cross-links, digestion with elastase
only led to the identification of 42 cross-links (Figure 3a). This might be due to the
increase in the database, which is quite significant because of the n2 behavior of the search space from cross-linked
peptides. However, adding trypsin to the elastase digest improved
the detection of cross-links, despite the increase in database size.
On the one hand, adding trypsin to the elastase-digested peptides
increased the complexity of the samples, but on the other hand, it
produced semitryptic and tryptic peptides featuring peptides with
a positive C-terminal charge. As 111 cross-links were identified with
the elastase–trypsin digest, the new peptides with tryptic
C-termini seemed to have a bigger impact than the increase in complexity.
Our analysis so far indicated that reversing the order to trypsin
followed by elastase reduces the complexity of the sample and should
therefore improve detection of cross-linked peptides. Indeed, more
cross-links (131) were identified with the trypsin–elastase
digest compared with the elastase–trypsin digest. As a final
test of our workflow, we fitted the detected cross-links into the
crystal structure of HSA (PDB: 1AO6, monomeric; Figure 3b). As expected from the link-level FDR (5%),
5% of the links derived from the trypsin–elastase digest were
overly long (Figure 3c).

residues. (a) Number of cross-links identified for HSA. (b) Cross-links

digest, dark green.

Having successfully tested
our workflow on HSA, we moved on to
analyze the TAF4–TAF12 complex. Sequence coverage of both TAF4
and TAF12 decreased from 74 and 75% to 73 and 65%, respectively, when
trypsin was replaced by elastase (Figure 3d,e). In marked contrast, adding elastase
to tryptic peptides increased sequence coverage of TAF4 to 93% and
TAF12 to 92%. Reversing the order of digestion to elastase–trypsin
still increased the sequence coverage of TAF4 and TAF12 to 95 and
85%. Our previous observation on the impact of complexity and positively
charged C-termini on cross-link identification held true for the analysis
of the TAF4–12 complex. We identified 162 cross-links with
trypsin alone, followed by 115 and 42 cross-links for trypsin–elastase
and elastase–trypsin digestion, respectively. A very small
number of cross-links (six) was detected when only elastase was used.
The cross-links determined from the sequential trypsin–elastase
digest were highly complementary to the trypsin data, with only 59
shared out of 218 identified cross-links (Figure 3f). Importantly, the additional digestion
of tryptic peptides by elastase provided data in the previously undetected
N-terminal region of TAF4 (Figure 3g).

To test the behavior of elastase in complex
mixtures, we applied
the protocol to whole-cell lysate of S. pombe. Three
characteristics of the identified peptides (peptide length, peptide
type, and amount of miscleavages) indicate that the length of the
substrate influences the activity of elastase. Although digesting
tryptic peptides with elastase reduced the number of longer peptides,
the median of all digests containing elastase was 13 amino acids (Figure 4a). If the activity
of elastase were not influenced by the substrate size, the distribution
of tryptic, semitryptic, and elastase peptides would be independent
of the digestion order. However, sequential trypsin–elastase
digestion led to more tryptic peptides than elastase–trypsin
digestion (Figure 4b). Shorter peptides were very poor substrates for the second enzyme.
Consequently, the first enzyme produced the majority of the peptides.
Because of the favorable mass-spectrometric behavior of tryptic peptides,
trypsin should always be the first enzyme used in a sequential digestion.
Unsurprisingly, a higher number of miscleavages occurred when elastase
was used in all enzyme combinations (Figure 4c). Interestingly, treating the sample with
trypsin prior to elastase digestion increased miscleavages. This suggests
that the treatment with trypsin reduced the available elastase sites,
presumably through their “protection” of being in smaller
peptides.

Overlap of observed residues by trypsin and sequential trypsin–elastase
digestion. Data shown are the means ± SD of duplicate injections
from three independent digestions. Trypsin, dark blue; elastase, light
blue; sequential trypsin–elastase, light green; sequential
elastase–trypsin digest, dark green.

The highest number, with 1377 ± 62 protein identifications,
was achieved using only trypsin (Figure 4d). Subsequent elastase digestion reduced
the numbers to 874 ± 39. Using only elastase yielded 593 ±
6 protein identifications. The least amount of proteins, 492 ±
115 proteins, was identified with sequential elastase–trypsin.
More of the identified semitryptic peptides from the sequential digests
had tryptic C-termini (55 ± 2%). Although the difference is not
as pronounced as for the TAF4–12 complex, it is consistent
with a favorable property of a positively charged residue at the C-terminus
for MS/MS analysis. This may also explain in part the reduced identification
numbers in the sequential digestion compared with trypsin alone. Peptides
with a nontryptic C-terminus should be as frequent in the mixture
as with a nontryptic N-terminus. A reduced number of identifications
paired with a similar number of MS2 spectra between trypsin and sequential
digestion suggests that the challenge is in MS2. Indeed, although
the number of MS2 for the trypsin (35 203 ± 3088) and
the sequential trypsin–elastase digests (35 160 ±
3322) were quite similar, only 31 ± 3% of the MS2 spectra from
the trypsin–elastase digest could be matched, compared with
54 ± 2% from the tryptic digest (Figure 4e). In terms of sequence coverage, the larger
number of peptides identified in the trypsin digest also resulted
in more residues being covered (190 261 ± 8215) than with
the sequential digest (100 570 ± 10 660). However,
peptides derived from the sequential digest covered some different
regions than the tryptic peptides, expanding the covered sequence
space of trypsin by 11% (Figure 4f).

Conclusion
Elastase digestion leading
to complementary data compared with
trypsin digestion has been shown before and could be confirmed in
our study.17,33 Although sequential digests have
been used before,34−36 to our knowledge elastase has not been exploited
in sequential digestion of tryptic peptides or for CLMS. Elastase
generates very complex peptide mixtures, with many peptides having
sequence overlap. Conceptually, CLMS does not combine well with the
use of elastase or other proteases with broad cleavage specificity.
The increase of complexity and loss in sensitivity normally accompanying
the occurrence of overlapping peptides is exacerbated in cross-linking.
Every cross-linked peptide consists of two peptides and consequently
is subject to combinatorial loss. This meets an already low abundance
of cross-linked peptides. The cleavage by trypsin prior to elastase
digestion reduces the complexity that is typically associated with
elastase digestion. The cleavage of tryptic peptides by elastase is
biased toward long peptides and increases their detection. As a result,
we detect cross-links in the difficult-to-digest N-terminal region
of TAF4. Our protocol of using trypsin prior to a complementary enzyme
to enhance the performance of the complementary enzyme is also applicable
to other enzymes, as was shown recently for AspN, GluC, and chymotrypsin.15 These gains, at least for elastase, transfer
to proteomics at large as shown by our results in S. pombe lysate. We anticipate that our protocol will therefore also be useful
for other proteomic applications. This includes the detection of post-translational
modifications and the analysis of transmembrane domains. The former
benefits from increased sequence observation, whereas trypsin leads
to systematically large peptides in the latter.
