Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is
a versatile tool for visualizing
molecular distributions in complex biological specimens, but locating
microscopic chemical features of interest can be challenging in samples
that lack a well-defined anatomy. To address this issue, we developed
a correlated imaging approach that begins with performing matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MSI to obtain low-resolution molecular
maps of a sample. The resulting maps are then used to direct subsequent
microscopic secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) imaging and tandem
mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments to examine selected chemical
regions of interest. By employing MALDI undersampling, the sample
surface is left mostly unperturbed and available for the SIMS analysis,
while also generating an ablation array that can be used for navigation
in SIMS. We validated this MALDI-guided SIMS approach using cultured
biofilms of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas
aeruginosa; bioactive secondary metabolites, including
rhamnolipids and quinolones, were detected and visualized on both
macro- and microscopic size scales. MSI mass assignments were confirmed
with in situ MALDI MS/MS and capillary electrophoresis–electrospray
ionization MS/MS analysis of biofilm extracts. Two strains of P. aeruginosa were compared, wild type and a quorum
sensing mutant, and differences in metabolite abundance and distribution
were observed.

==== Body
Mass spectrometry
imaging (MSI)
is an analytical approach that enables multiplexed, label-free, and
nontargeted chemical imaging of sample surfaces.1−3 These features
make it a useful tool for visualizing spatially heterogeneous chemical
environments, especially for small molecules such as drugs and metabolites,
which can otherwise be difficult to reliably label and distinguish
from structurally similar compounds. MSI is commonly performed by
scanning a microprobe over the sample surface and acquiring mass spectra
at thousands of discrete positions in a rectangular array. Hundreds
of unique ions are routinely detected per spectrum, and any of these
signals may be used to generate an ion image representing the relative
abundance of the ionized compound across the analyzed region.

Many different microprobes are available for MSI, including focused
lasers for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)4,5 and focused ion beams for secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).6−8 MALDI and SIMS are complementary techniques; MALDI affords excellent
detection limits and a broad mass range extending to tens of kDa (in
practice for MSI), and SIMS provides the highest lateral spatial resolution
and nanometer scale depth resolution,9 but
with a more limited (typically sub-kDa) mass range. MALDI requires
chemical modification of the sample surface to enhance the yields
of nonvolatile high molecular weight species to useful levels; this
is often accomplished by applying a dissolved organic compound that
subsequently dries and crystallizes on the surface, but alternative
matrixes such as sputtered metal coatings10,11 are also used. SIMS does not require a matrix but can nevertheless
benefit from similar treatments, including metal coatings.10−12 Methods that combine MALDI and SIMS imaging have been utilized recently
for multiscale chemical mapping of nervous tissue,13,14 skin and kidney,15 single cultured neurons,13 bacterial biofilms,16 and a biofuel feedstock grass.12

Microscopic MSI allows multiplexed visualization of unlabeled analytes
at cellular and subcellular sizes,17 but
it also involves trade-offs: sampled surface area (per pixel) and
detected ions decrease quadratically with probe diameter, while pixel
count, and therefore data file size and acquisition time, increase
quadratically with spatial resolution. In practice, the increase in
experimental time may even be larger than quadratic because one often
needs to acquire a greater number of laser/ion shots to make up for
the smaller amount of material present in the smaller pixel size.
These issues equate to practical limitations; large samples are not
normally imaged entirely at high resolution given the time that this
takes, and so a microscopic region of interest (ROI) must first be
specified by some other means. Optical image correlation is often
used for MSI of tissue sections, but this approach depends on having
a sample with a well-understood anatomy and obvious morphological
features, e.g., white and gray matter of brain tissue. Immunohistological
staining has been applied prior to MSI in order to enhance the information
content of the optical image,18 but this
requires having a specific marker of interest, and also involves immersion
of the sample in liquid washes and stain(s), which results in chemical
modification and analyte delocalization on the microscopic scale.
Thus, for samples that lack a visible and well-defined anatomy, new
imaging techniques are needed.

To address the concerns outlined
above, we developed a MALDI-guided
SIMS approach wherein a full-sample chemical map is first acquired
by MALDI MS. This map is then used as a guide in performing high resolution
SIMS imaging of microscopic ROIs. Metal-assisted sample preparation
is utilized to ensure compatibility between both ion imaging methods,
and MALDI undersampling is used in order to leave an unperturbed sample
area for subsequent SIMS imaging. Laser ablation spots are visualized
in the SIMS images and used to precisely specify microscopic ROIs.
The larger laser ablation volume of MALDI yields substantially higher
ion counts, enabling in situ ion identification with tandem mass spectrometry
(MS/MS) on the same sample subsequent to imaging. Additionally, mutual
detection of a given molecular compound by both ionization techniques
serves as cross-validation of the mass assignments.

We used
MALDI-guided SIMS to interrogate cultured biofilms of the
opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in order to visualize secondary metabolites that are involved in
biofilm growth and cellular signaling. These compounds were detected
as intact pseudomolecular ions for the first time using SIMS, and
confirmed with in situ MS/MS as well as capillary electrophoresis–electrospray
ionization (CE–ESI) MS/MS of bulk biofilm extracts. Although
MALDI MSI has yielded informative “colony scale” images19,20 and SIMS imaging has been applied to obtain exquisite cell scale
chemical information21−24 in previous microbiological studies, the unique sequential combination
of MALDI and SIMS utilized here guides high-resolution imaging systematically
and also enables this information to be placed within the macroscopic
spatial context of the biofilm.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Chemicals
Mixed rhamnolipid “R-95
Rhamnolipid” (95%, AldrichCPR), 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone
(Pseudomonas quinolone signal, PQS),
and 2-heptyl-4-quinolone (HHQ) standards were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St Louis, MO) and dissolved in methanol for MS experiments. The substrates
for biofilm growth were created by scoring silicon (100) wafers (4
in. diameter, Silicon, Inc., Boise, ID) with a diamond scribe, and
breaking them to yield 2 × 2 cm tiles before use. Solvents and
buffer ingredients for CE–MS were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and the mixtures prepared in lab.

Biofilm Growth
Two P. aeruginosa strains were used
in this work: wild type (WT) (ATCC 15692, ATCC,
Manassas, VA) and the quorum sensing (QS) ΔlasIΔrhlI mutant,25 which is deficient in homoserine lactone production, i.e., has disabled
QS. Cell suspensions were grown at 30 °C overnight in fastidious
anaerobe broth culture medium26 with a
filter-sterilized glucose carbon source (150 μL of 1.2 M glucose
solution per 6 mL of culture) and then transferred to Petri dishes.
Cell suspension in the Petri dishes was diluted 50× with culture
medium, allowed 1 min for initial cell attachment, and then the silicon
tiles were fully submerged in the mixture. Static biofilms were permitted
to grow for 72 h at 30 °C. Growth medium was then removed from
the Petri dishes by pipette and the biofilms were allowed to air-dry
completely prior to preparation for MSI analysis.

Mass Spectrometry
Imaging
Sputter coating was performed
using a Desk II TSC sputter coater equipped with a gold target (Denton
Vacuum, Moorestown, NJ) operated at 64 mTorr Ar pressure and 40% power
with 6 s of application time. MALDI MS was performed on an UltrafleXtreme
MALDI-time-of-flight (TOF)/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics,
Billerca, MA) in positive ion mode, reflectron enabled, acquiring m/z 20–1000, and equipped with a
frequency-tripled Nd:YAG laser focused to an ∼100 μm
probe diameter and triggered at 1000 Hz. Quadratic mass calibration
was performed with K+ and Aun+ cluster ions detected from the prepared sample. MS/MS
(TOF/TOF) was performed by postsource decay without CID (collision-induced
dissociation), adjusting the laser power to optimize fragmentation
for individual ions of interest. Data were processed using FlexAnalysis
v3.4 and FlexImaging v3.0 (Bruker Daltonics); ion filters were set
to m/z ± 0.25 and images normalized
to total ion count. SIMS imaging was performed on a TRIFT III (Physical
Electronics, Chanhassen, MN) TOF mass spectrometer using a 22 keV
Au+ primary ion source yielding an ∼ 2-nA sample current and a 500 nm diameter probe spot. Images were
acquired in the static SIMS regime, i.e., with a primary beam flux
of <1× 1012 primary ions/cm2. Control
and data processing were performed using WinCadence v4.4 software
(Physical Electronics, Eden Prairie, MN). Calibration was performed
with H+, Na+, K+, and Aun+ cluster ions. Optical images of samples
were acquired with a Perfection V300 Photo flatbed scanner (Epson,
Suwa, Nagano, Japan).

For the MALDI-guided SIMS experiments,
bacterial biofilms were first cultured and dried on silicon as described
above. A thin layer of gold (∼ 2 nm) was applied
to the sample and then an optical reference image was acquired. We
affixed the silicon pieces onto steel plates with double-sided conductive
copper-backed tape; the steel plates match the size required by the
Bruker MTP ABI plate adapter that holds older ABI MALDI TOF targets.
The steel plates were milled to produce a recessed area matching the
height of the mounted sample (silicon substrate plus tape) in order
to level the sample surface with the MALDI target surface; this was
critical for obtaining high quality MS spectra. The entire sample
surface was then imaged by MALDI MS at a 500 or 1000 μm pitch,
500 shots per position. The MALDI ion images were inspected and used
to select ROIs for microscopic SIMS analysis. The sample was transferred
to the SIMS instrument, with care taken to maintain orientation. A
SIMS “survey” was then acquired in mosaic mapping mode
in which a relatively large (typically 4 × 4 mm) area was imaged
quickly at low resolution (16 × 16 μm pixel size) by stitching
multiple small and fast (1 s accumulation time) ion images together.
This yielded images with low signal and contrast, but sufficient to
visualize the MALDI ablation marks that were used for sample navigation
and correlation with MALDI images. High-resolution SIMS images (typically
a 150 × 150 μm field of view and 0.6 × 0.6 μm
pixel size) were then acquired at ROIs specified from the MALDI map
and subsequent SIMS survey. At least three each of the WT and QS mutant
biofilms were prepared and imaged in this manner; physical and chemical
features (and therefore imaging results) varied slightly between batches,
so the results presented here are representative of consistent observations.

CE–ESI MS/MS Biofilm Extract Analysis
CE–ESI
MS/MS was performed as reported previously27 using both an Impact HD or a maXis 4G Qq-ToF mass spectrometer (Bruker
Daltonics) operated in positive and negative ion modes. Biofilm extracts
were prepared by collecting ∼1 mg of dried biofilm from the
silicon substrate with a clean razor blade, depositing the film into
a microcentrifuge vial, adding 20 μL of extraction solution
(50/50 (v/v) MeOH:H2O + 0.5% AcOH), shaking vigorously
for 2 min, then centrifuging for 5 min at 2000g.
For each run, 6 nL of supernatant was loaded into a capillary (65–70
cm long) and a separation potential of 15 kV applied. For negative
ion mode analysis, CE was performed using a background electrolyte
composed of 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate, and a sheath liquid of 60%
(v/v) isopropyl alcohol and 200 μM ammonium bicarbonate, delivered
at 600 nL per minute. Instrument calibration was performed using sodium
acetate clusters in negative ion mode. Molecular features were assigned
with high confidence through matching of the tandem mass spectral
data from the endogenous substances with those found at publicly available
mass spectral databases (METLIN28).

Results
MALDI-directed SIMS imaging enables the specification of ROIs for
high-resolution MSI of specimens that lack a characteristic anatomy,
as in the bacterial biofilms studied here. A schematic of the overall
workflow is shown in Figure 1 and described
below.

Figure 1 Workflow schematic of a MALDI-guided SIMS experiment, illustrating:
(A) sample preparation to meet vacuum MS requirements (must be flat,
dry, and mounted to a conductive or semiconductive substrate), (B)
surface chemical treatment for ion signal enhancement, (C) undersampling
MALDI MS image acquisition across the specimen surface, (D) specification
of ROIs for SIMS analysis based on the MALDI chemical map, and (E)
SIMS imaging at microscopic ROIs.

Dried biofilm samples were first sputter-coated with a 1–2
nm thick Au film for metal-assisted MS, providing signal enhancement
for small molecules (effective to <1000 Da) with multiple additional
advantages: mutual compatibility with both laser desorption/ionization
and SIMS, no reduction in lateral resolution due to diffusion of analytes
during solvent application or due to matrix particle size, minimal
low-mass chemical background, monoisotopic Aun+ peaks for internal calibration, improved sample
conductance to mitigate sample charging effects in SIMS, and optical
transparency, facilitating sample navigation and optical imaging after
application. The thickness of the Au coating, optimized using mixed
rhamnolipid standard spotted on a silicon wafer, was found to provide
an over 10-fold signal enhancement for [M + Na]+ ions (shown
in Figure S1, Supporting Information).
Typical SIMS and MALDI MS profiles are shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information).

MS microprobes
are inherently destructive, so a challenge in MALDI-guided
SIMS is to acquire the MALDI image while leaving most of the sample
surface unperturbed for subsequent SIMS imaging. This was accomplished
by undersampling, i.e., setting pixel size and array pitch to a length
much larger than the microprobe diameter. The effect of undersampling
is apparent in Figure 2, showing selected results
from the analysis of a WT P. aeruginosa biofilm.

Figure 2 Selected results from MALDI-guided SIMS of a WT P. aeruginosa biofilm. (A) Optical and (B) MALDI
ion images of quinolone PQS (m/z 260.17) are acquired, and an ROI (dotted white square) is selected
for further analysis (scale bars = 4 mm). (C) Mosaic-mode SIMS total
ion image reveals laser ablation marks in the sample, and these positions
are correlated with the MALDI ion image to select a microscopic ROI
(black square, scale bar = 1 mm). High-resolution SIMS imaging at
the ROI reveals micrometer scale localization of (D) PQS (m/z 260.17) and (E) HHQ (m/z 244.17) on the biofilm (scale bars = 100 μm).

MALDI imaging was performed in
this experiment with a 1 mm pitch
and 100 μm diameter laser microprobe, obtaining a coarse chemical
map for multiple biologically related ions, including PQS (MH+ at m/z 260.17), shown in
Figure 2B. The laser ablation spots are clearly
visible in the SIMS total ion image shown in Figure 2C as a decrease in overall signal, likely due to removal of
the signal-enhancing metal coating, and these features form an array
that can be used to navigate the sample and select ROIs for SIMS imaging,
precisely positioned in relation to the MALDI data. In the ROI selected
here, microscopic SIMS images show differential distribution of PQS
(Figure 2D) and HHQ (MH+ at m/z 244.17) (Figure 2E). In addition to the MS/MS analyses discussed below, the assignment
of these ions was confirmed by colocalization of ion fragments that
are characteristic of their respective quinolone molecular classes
(as shown in Figure S3, Supporting Information).29

Although mass profiles varied
between and within individual biofilms,
up to nine mono- and di-rhamnolipids, and seven quinolone compounds,
were consistently detected in the WT P. aeruginosa biofilms. All nine putative rhamnolipids were confirmed by CE–ESI-MS/MS
analysis of bulk WT biofilm extract (results shown in Figure S4, Supporting Information), and six of the nine
could be confirmed directly from the biofilm using in situ MALDI MS/MS,
as we reported recently,30 in comparison
with standards and in agreement with previously published fragmentation
analysis.31 Rhamnolipids were predominantly
detected as sodium adducts ([M + Na]+ and sometimes [M
– H + 2Na]+) by both MALDI and SIMS, and as deprotonated
pseudomolecular ions by ESI, consistent with previous work.32 Similarly, all seven putative quinolones were
confirmed by CE–ESI MS/MS (shown in Figure S4, Supporting Information); HHQ, PQS, and NHQ were
also confirmed by in situ MALDI MS/MS (spectra shown in Figure S5, Supporting Information). Quinolones were detected
as primarily MH+ ions (and [M – H]− ions with ESI), which is consistent with previous ESI MS work,29 and formation of these ions in SIMS was also
confirmed with quinolone standards (PQS and HHQ; others were not available),
both of which yielded primarily MH+ ions after metal enhancement
(as shown in Figure S6, Supporting Information). Several pairs of known quinolones are isobaric, including PQS
and 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline-N-oxide (HQNO), but these were discerned
by MS/MS fragmentation patterns.29 In the
case of PQS and HQNO at m/z 260,
in situ MALDI MS/MS yielded predominantly PQS-related fragments (m/z 175, 188) and little or no contribution
from HQNO (m/z 159, 172). Using
CE–MS/MS, detectable quantities of HQNO were observed from
a biofilm extract; our lack of detection of this compound by MALDI
and SIMS may indicate that HQNO is localized below the MALDI and SIMS
sampling depth within the biofilm, or that low levels (below our MSI
detection limits) are uniformly distributed on the surface. Table 1 compiles the MALDI MS, SIMS, and CE–ESI
MS data acquired from the WT P. aeruginosa biofilms. The standard rhamnolipid notation used here is detailed
elsewhere.33

Comparison of WT and QS
mutant P. aeruginosa biofilms
WT and QS
mutant P. aeruginosa biofilms were
compared using MALDI-guided SIMS to characterize spatiochemical
differences arising from a disabled QS system, with the results shown
in Figure 3. These biofilms were gold-coated
and imaged by MALDI in a single experiment to minimize preparation-
and instrument-related variations.

Figure 3 MALDI-guided SIMS images reveal multiscale
compositional differences
between the biofilms of WT and QS mutant P. aeruginosa. (Top row) Arrows in the optical (top image) and MALDI ion (bottom
image) images indicate ROIs where the (middle and bottom rows) SIMS
images were acquired. MALDI and SIMS ion image false color scales
are shown on the right; for each specific ion, the SIMS color scale
range was set identically in QS Mutant and WT ion images: Rha-Rha-C10-C10 ([M + Na]+m/z 673.4), 0–5 counts (cts); Rha-C10-C10 ([M + Na]+m/z 527.3), 0–8 cts; HHQ (MH+m/z 244.2), 0–40 cts; PQS (MH+m/z 260.2), 0–10 cts; NHQ (MH+m/z 272.2), 0–100 cts. WT and QS
mutant biofilms were imaged in a single experiment by MALDI and the
color scales are the same for each ion in MALDI images as well. Optical/MALDI
scale bars =2 mm, SIMS scale bars =100 μm. Regions of WT biofilm
where tape was adhered to the surface were excluded.

The MALDI images in Figure 3 show a high
abundance of the major rhamnolipids Rha-Rha-C10-C10 and Rha-C10-C10 (both detected as [M + Na]+ at m/z 673.4 and 527.3,
respectively), distributed uniformly across the WT biofilm but completely
absent in the QS mutant biofilm. The SIMS images reflect these observations
on the microscopic scale; rhamnolipids are uniformly distributed in
the WT biofilm, but they are not seen in the QS mutant biofilm. In
contrast, quinolones were highly heterogeneous within and between
both samples. HHQ shows comparable overall abundance between biofilms
in the MALDI image, though a macroscopic region of relatively high
abundance can be seen to follow the growth contour of the QS mutant.
The HHQ SIMS image at this feature likewise shows higher overall signal
as well as “hot spots” of intense localization in aggregated
clusters of <10 μm features, whereas the WT biofilm SIMS
image shows lower overall abundance and smaller, less intense localizations
without the aggregate features. Another prominent quinolone, 2-nonyl-4-quinolone
(NHQ, MH+ at m/z 272.2),
exhibits sparse localizations in the MALDI images of both biofilms,
and appears to colocalize with HHQ in the microscopic aggregates.
Lower resolution mosaic SIMS images acquired around the specified
ROIs on these biofilms (shown in Figure S7, Supporting
Information) indicate that these aggregates are abundant across
the surface of the QS mutant biofilm in the selected area, while not
observed at all with the WT. In contrast, PQS shows higher abundance
on the WT biofilm in the MALDI image, and this is also reflected in
the selected SIMS ROIs, which show less PQS on the QS mutant relative
to the other quinolones.

Discussion
MALDI-guided SIMS imaging
enables visualization of molecular distributions
on both the microscopic (cell) and macroscopic (population) size scales.
The approach was validated with P. aeruginosa in order to visualize the chemical features associated with growth
and cellular signaling. P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen known for organizing into biofilms,
thin layers of bacteria adhered to a surface and embedded in a self-produced
extracellular polymeric matrix, which imparts numerous advantages
to ensure survival.34−36 Biofilm development is regulated via cell-to-cell
chemical signaling, which includes quorum sensing (QS),37 utilizing several classes of secondary metabolites
such as homoserine lactones,38 quinolones,39 rhamnolipids40 and
phenazines.41 This chemical language is
expansive, P. aeruginosa produces over
50 distinct quinolone compounds alone,29 and is also highly complex, as a single metabolite may play several
distinct roles in biofilm development.39 Functional characterization is incomplete for most of these compounds,
so there is a great deal yet to be elucidated about their roles in
biofilm growth and homeostasis.

Several interesting observations
were made about P. aeruginosa biofilm
composition based on the optical,
low-resolution MALDI, and high-resolution SIMS images obtained in
this work. The MALDI MS images show heterogeneous macroscopic distributions
of many biomolecules, including PQS (Figure 2B), which appear to follow biofilm growth contours, at least partially.
PQS production varies with cell density and population maturity,42 thus the observed distribution may reflect temporal
changes in production during biofilm growth and expansion. SIMS analysis
directed at a region of high PQS abundance revealed a punctate microscopic
distribution for PQS (Figure 2D), concentrated
in micrometer scale features. These features could be clusters of
cells exposed at the surface of the biofilm, or aggregations of membrane
vesicles, which have been shown to contain ∼90% of the PQS
produced by P. aeruginosa.43 Several other quinolones were typically also
detected along with PQS, and interestingly, these quinolones were
not always colocalized; Figure 2E shows a region
where HHQ was observed to be similarly punctate but distributed differently.
HHQ is the direct precursor to PQS,44 released
by cells and taken back up by others for PQS production;29 therefore, the features observed in the HHQ
SIMS image may represent pockets of secreted HHQ. HHQ is also an autoinducer,45 so local concentration around producing cells
in the biofilm may increase production further via positive feedback.
The differential distributions of HHQ and PQS observed here also raise
the possibility of cell specialization within a biofilm population,
a phenomenon known to occur with other biofilm-producing microbes
such as Bacillus subtilis, but not
yet reported with P. aeruginosa.46

Several of the differences observed between
the WT and QS mutant P. aeruginosa strains
studied here fit well with
what is known about their genomes. The QS mutant is a ΔlasIΔrhlI strain, which is incapable of synthesizing N-3-oxo-dodecanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (HSL) (3-oxo-C12-HSL) and N-butyryl-l-HSL (C4-HSL), two “master regulator”
signals controlling the P. aeruginosa QS systems, las and rhl, respectively.38 One expected effect of these mutations is a
complete lack of rhamnolipid production,25 a change that is clearly visualized in both the MALDI and SIMS ion
images of the rhamnolipids Rha-Rha-C10-C10 and
Rha-C10-C10. Quinolone biosynthesis is also
regulated by these signals indirectly and in a competitive manner;
3-oxo-C12-HSL promotes PQS production whereas C4-HSL suppresses it.38 Thus, the reduced
PQS levels detected in the QS mutant biofilm may arise from loss of las promotion, with residual PQS produced by promotion from
other signaling pathways, as the las system is not
the dominant driver of PQS biosynthesis under certain growth conditions.47

The changes observed in the HHQ and NHQ
distributions are not as
easily explained, partly because they are more subtle, and partly
because these quinolones are not as well-characterized as PQS, so
the effect of the ΔlasIΔrhlI mutations
on their abundance and distribution is less easily interpreted. The
microscopic quinolone aggregations observed in the QS mutant biofilm
could be due to a lack of rhamnolipid production; rhamnolipids act
as surfactants, which can mobilize cells40 and solubilize quinolones in the biofilm,48 so secreted quinolones or cells may aggregate more extensively without
them. Another possible explanation is that PQS is required for production
of the membrane vesicles that ordinarily transmit quinolones and other
metabolites between cells,43 so decreased
PQS levels may result in reduced vesicular production and consequently,
a local buildup of other quinolones around the cells of origin. Ongoing
work is focused on elucidating the role of these quinolones and others
in P. aeruginosa biofilms using MALDI-guided
SIMS and Raman imaging.

Conclusions
We have developed a
sequentially combined chemical imaging approach
wherein an undersampled MALDI MS image is used to guide microscopic
SIMS imaging experiments to target chemically interesting ROIs on
the same sample. This combination of complementary microprobes conveys
numerous advantages in an MSI experiment, including: (1) specification
of microscopic ROIs from a chemical map rather than an optical image,
(2) spatially registered macro- and microscopic chemical images of
a single sample, (3) generation of a fiducial grid for sample navigation
in SIMS, and (4) MALDI MS/MS capability for in situ ion characterization.
Applied to bacterial biofilms of P. aeruginosa, MALDI-guided SIMS enabled the detection and visualization of multiple
secondary metabolites, including rhamnolipid surfactants and quinolone
signaling molecules that heretofore have not been reported using SIMS
alone. The combination of SIMS and MALDI revealed both macroscopic
and cell scale chemical heterogeneity across the biofilms for the
analytes studied, and can be applied to other samples where similar
multiscale complexity exists, such as tissue sections. Additionally,
although a single metal-enhanced preparation was utilized in this
work for compatibility with both MALDI and SIMS, future work will
include applying traditional MALDI matrixes in a microdroplet array
in order to extend the mass range to include detection of proteins
and other macromolecules of interest.
