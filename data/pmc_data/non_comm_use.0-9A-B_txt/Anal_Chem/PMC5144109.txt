A receptor binding
class of d-amino acid-containing peptides
(DAACPs) is formed in animals from an enzymatically mediated post-translational
modification of ribosomally translated all-l-amino acid peptides.
Although this modification can be required for biological actions,
detecting it is challenging because DAACPs have the same mass as their
all-l-amino acid counterparts. We developed a suite of mass
spectrometry (MS) protocols for the nontargeted discovery of DAACPs
and validated their effectiveness using neurons from Aplysia
californica. The approach involves the following three steps,
with each confirming and refining the hits found in the prior step.
The first step is screening for peptides resistant to digestion by
aminopeptidase M. The second verifies the presence of a chiral amino
acid via acid hydrolysis in deuterium chloride, labeling with Marfey’s
reagent, and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry to determine
the chirality of each amino acid. The third involves synthesizing
the putative DAACPs and comparing them to the endogenous standards.
Advantages of the method, the d-amino acid-containing neuropeptide
discovery funnel, are that it is capable of detecting the d-form of any common chiral amino acid, and the first two steps do
not require peptide standards. Using these protocols, we report that
two peptides from the Aplysia achatin-like neuropeptide
precursor exist as GdYFD and SdYADSKDEESNAALSDFA.
Interestingly, GdYFD was bioactive in the Aplysia feeding and locomotor circuits but SdYADSKDEESNAALSDFA
was not. The discovery funnel provides an effective means to characterize
DAACPs in the nervous systems of animals in a nontargeted manner.

==== Body
Neuropeptides
are a class of
cell–cell signaling molecules processed from protein prohormones.
They are produced in the nervous system and exert effects on virtually
all organs, being implicated in processes like reproduction,1 food intake,2 and
circadian rhythms.3 The proteins used to
generate neuropeptides are ribosomally translated using only l-amino acids. During this process, they undergo enzymatic post-translational
modifications (PTMs), which include cleavages by prohormone convertases
and additional modifications such as amidation.4 These PTMs are required to create the bioactive form of
the peptide. One understudied PTM of neuropeptides is peptide isomerization,
where roughly 40 DAACPs have been found as toxins, neurohormones,
and neuropeptides.5,6 In neuropeptides, this involves
the enzymatic conversion of one residue near the N-terminus from an l-amino acid to a d-amino acid.5,7−13

However, unlike most other PTMs, isomerization is a zero-Dalton
shift in molecular weight and so it is not easily detectable by mass
spectrometry (MS); several strategies have thus emerged to enable
isomerization detection.6 One way to overcome
this difficulty is via the use of MS/MS-based techniques and comparing
peptides with only l-amino acids to their DAACP epimers.7,14−18 Recently, MALDI-TOF/TOF was used for the discovery of d-Leu in the peptide GH-2.19 This study
also established a stereosensitive fragmentation effect of d-amino acids from various amino acid classes on different peptide
sequences, which can aid in the discovery of DAACPs through MALDI-TOF/TOF
by observing the fragmentation ratios of specific peptides. Another
way to facilitate the discovery is to use bioinformatics to find neuropeptides
that are homologous to known DAACPs in related species.7 What is needed is a set of measurement techniques
capable of identifying DAACPs in a nontargeted manner, rather than
targeting a suspected DAACP based on homology.

Other methods,
such as those using chemical tags or enzymatic approaches,
have been developed to detect DAACPs that are formed spontaneously,
where racemization of a residue is a pathological or aging-related
process.18,20−22 Using photolabile tags
combined with electron capture dissociation MS, d-Ala, d-Ser, and d-Asp were identified in peptides of lens
proteins.18 Isomers of l-Asp,
including d-Asp, l-iso-Asp, and d-iso-Asp,
were distinguished in lens protein peptides using differential enzyme
digestion with endoprotease Asp-N, protein-l-isoaspartyl
methyltransferase, and paenidase (d-aspartic acid endopeptidase).21 Deuterium chloride-assisted acid hydrolysis
was also used in conjunction with 4-fluoro-7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole
(NBD-F) labeling to identify d-amino acid enantiomers of
Ala, Asp, Glu, Pro, and Ser in peptides of ovalbumin.22

While these methods have increased the rate and sensitivity
of
identifying spontaneously forming DAACPs, the ability to identify
endogenous DAACPs in a complex biological system remains elusive.
Moreover, these approaches have been directed to specific proteins
and also have involved the use of standards for initial inquiry, an
undesirable option if hundreds of peptides are potential DAACPs. If
the incorrect l-form of the peptide is tested, this potentially
creates a gap in peptidomic studies, thereby underestimating the number
of biologically active peptides in an organism. Since MS has been
an enabling tool in modern peptidomic studies, there could be DAACPs
hiding among the peptides already discovered.

We report a toolset,
or discovery funnel, for the nontargeted detection
of DAACPs, particularly neuropeptides, that takes the following issues
into consideration. First, for neuropeptides (unlike spontaneously
formed DAACPs and some toxins), isomerization occurs at the second
position from the N-termini, except for the crustacean neurohormones.23,24 Second, the variety of amino acid residues that are isomerized may
include any of the chiral amino acids. When including toxin peptides,
endogenous DAACPs have included d-amino acid enantiomers
of aromatic amino acids, polar amino acids, and aliphatic amino acids.5,6 Thus, a method to uncover DAACPs should take advantage of isomerization
near the termini and be able to simultaneously assay the enantiomers
of the 19 common chiral amino acids. Third, there are literally hundreds
to thousands of brain peptides in most animal models. Thus, requiring
peptide standards for the initial screening steps for DAACP discovery
appears impractical and economically infeasible.

Specifically,
the first stage of discovery takes advantage of the
fact that DAACPs are resistant to peptidases such as aminopeptidase
M (APM) (Figure 1,
stage 1).25 Next, candidate DAACPs are
isolated and subjected to a chiral amino acid analysis, where deuterium
chloride-assisted acid hydrolysis and labeling with Marfey’s
reagent (1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-l-alanine amide, FDAA)
are used to assay the chirality of amino acid residues in peptides
(Figure 1, stage 2).26,27 On the basis of information from the chiral analysis, a short list
of candidate peptides is determined. The peptides of interest are
synthesized and their retention times compared to the native forms
with liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to MS (Figure 1, stage 3). Some MS-based approaches for
DAACP discovery7,14−18 require a peptide standard for initial inquiry or
targeting specific sequences, a limitation that is reduced in this
method through the use of the enzyme APM. Synthetic peptides were
also used in the current study for characterization of the bioactivity
of DAACPs in a system-specific manner.

Figure 1 DAACP discovery funnel
is capable of identifying DAACPs in three
stages, as illustrated with GdFFD. In stage 1, MS-based detection
of APM digestion is capable of identifying potential DAACPs in the
screening phase of the discovery funnel. Here, GFFD, used as an example,
is rapidly degraded after 5 h, whereas its DAACP counterpart, GdFFD,
is not degraded after 24 h. Both are shown as a ratio to NdWFamide,
a peptide that is known to resist degradation by APM. In stage 2,
chiral analysis utilizes the MRM mode of MS to detect l-
and d-amino acids in a peptide following acid hydrolysis
and labeling. First, microwave-assisted vapor phase hydrolysis is
carried out in DCl to break down peptides into their component amino
acids. Importantly, DCl-based acid hydrolysis reduces detection of
racemized residues in peptides. The amino acids are then labeled with
Marfey’s reagent, separated, and detected using a triple quadrupole
mass spectrometer. The result of this step is outlined using GdFFD,
where a d-Phe is detected. In stage 3, confirmation of DAACPs,
peptides are synthesized with the suspected chirality at each position
and then compared to the endogenous peptides. Here, the retention
time of the endogenous peptide matches that of the GdFFD synthetic
standard, confirming its presence as a DAACP.

We validated the approach using Aplysia californica because two d-amino acid-containing neuropeptides have
already been identified in its nervous system: NdWFamide (Asn-d-Trp-Phe-NH2) and GdFFD (Gly-d-Phe-Phe-Asp-OH).7,28 More importantly, GdFFD originates from the Aplysia achatin-like neuropeptide precursor (apALNP), which produces additional
peptides.7 However, whether these additional
neuropeptides are DAACPs has not been explored because of the lack
of a systematic method for their study. Interestingly, in most known
cases, a single neuropeptide precursor appears to contain a single
DAACP.7,10,13 However, there
is at least one example where a single precursor produced two DAACPs.11,12 Thus, we both validate our discovery funnel and then use it to determine
whether there may be additional DAACPs in the Aplysia apALNP precursor. The value of using Aplysia as
our model is that its neuropeptidome has been the subject of intensive
study, and it is an excellent physiological model organism.29−35

The discovery funnel can be readily applied to investigating
biological
model systems in which DAACPs have not been discovered, uncovering
potential DAACPs from any precursor with N-terminally modified DAACPs.
Indeed, this approach has allowed us to identify three DAACPs from
a single precursor in Aplysia, suggesting that more
DAACPs in Aplysia remain to be discovered.

Experimental
Section
Animals
A. californica (120–1200
g) were purchased from Marinus Scientific (Long Beach, CA) and the Aplysia Research Facility (Miami, FL). Animals were kept
in an aquarium containing aerated and filtered artificial seawater
(Instant Ocean, Aquarium Systems Inc., Mentor, OH) at ∼14 °C
until used. Prior to dissection, animals were anesthetized by injection
of isotonic 333 mM MgCl2 (about 50% of body weight) into
the body cavity.

Reagents and Peptides
All reagents
were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) except where otherwise indicated. NdWFamide
was synthesized by the Protein Sciences Facility of the Roy J. Carver
Biotechnology Center, University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.
Other peptides (GFFamide, GdFFamide, GYFD, GdYFD, SYADSKDEESNAALSDFA,
and SdYADSKDEESNAALSDFA) were synthesized by CPC Scientific
(Sunnyvale, CA). Human angiotensin I acetate salt hydrate was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich.

Cell Sampling of GdFFD Neurons
In
situ hybridization
data were used as guidance for the isolation of neurons expressing
the GFFD prohormone (apALNP).7 The isolation
and sampling procedures are described in the Supporting Information, Additional Methods.

Peptide Extraction
For initial screening of DAACPs,
neuropeptide extracts from pedal ganglia were pooled from 24 euthanized
animals (including discovery of GdYFD); follow-up studies for SdYADSKDEESNAALSDFAED
involved 10 animals. Peptide extraction was performed in acidified
acetone (40:6:1 acetone: H2O:12 N HCl, v/v/v, acetone and
HCl from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), followed by centrifugation
at 14 000 rpm, at 4 °C for 20 min (Centrifuge 5804R, Eppendorf,
Westbury, NY). The supernatant was collected, dried (Savant Instruments,
Farmingdale, NY), and reconstituted in 5% acetonitrile (ACN) in H2O with formic acid (FA) (95% H2O, 5% CH3CN, 0.1% FA v/v/v).

APM Screening
Potential DAACPs in A. californica were selected from a complex peptide mixture
by their resistance
to digestion by APM.5,6,25 APM
(EC 3.4.11.2, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) reaction conditions were
25 mM Tris-HCl with 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.5, reacted at 37 °C for
24–48 h, depending on the application (48 h ensures a more
thorough digestion for peptide isolation). APM (at 60.6 U/mL) was
added to be 0.6% of the final reaction volume. Included in the digestion
experiments were a positive control, human angiotensin I, which is
digested by APM, and a negative control, NdWFamide, which is not digested
by APM.25 Peptide content was compared
between 0 and 24 h of the enzymatic digestion.

Separations and Mass Spectrometry
Several different
instruments and procedures were used for separating the peptides,
surveying the peptide contents, characterization of the peptides,
and quantitation of their constituent amino acids as described below
and in the Supporting Information.

Matrix-Assisted
Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF)
and MALDI-TOF/TOF Analysis
For APM screening, MALDI-TOF and
MALDI-TOF/TOF analyses were performed using an ultrafleXtreme mass
spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA). Mass spectra were
analyzed using flexAnalysis 3.4 (Bruker Daltonics). The mass was calibrated
using a peptide mixture of bradykinin 1–7 (757.4 [M + H]+), angiotensin II (1046.5 [M + H]+), angiotensin
I (1296.7 [M + H]+), substance P (1347.7 [M + H]+), bombesin (1619.8 [M + H]+), ACTH clip 1–17 (2093.1
[M + H]+), ACTH clip 18–39 (2465.2 [M + H]+), and somatostatin 28 (3147.5 [M + H]+). MS analysis
of each neuron was performed in positive-ion reflectron mode. The
laser size was set to “ultra”, ∼85 μm.
Each MALDI-TOF spectrum was summed from 5000 laser shots, 500 Hz.
Selected masses matching to apALNP peptides were chosen for follow-up
MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis via the “LIFT” mode with argon
as the collision gas.

Sequencing of Peptides
Peptide sequences
were confirmed
using an LC–MS set up comprised of an UltiMate 3000 RSLC system
(Thermo Scientific Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) coupled to an amaZon speed
ETD mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics), by comparing MS/MS fragmentation
(CID mode) to predicted fragment ions from Protein Prospector (UCSF, http://prospector.ucsf.edu) or fragment ion matching using BioTools 3.2 (Bruker Daltonics),
fragment mass tolerance 0.2 Da, minimal intensity threshold 800.

LC–Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS) for Structure Confirmation
Solvents for LC–MS/MS were purchased from Thermo Fisher
Scientific. To confirm that a peptide was a DAACP, peptide standards
were synthesized and compared to the endogenous peptides. For this
purpose, a hyphenated LC–MS/MS platform was employed; the LC
instrument was an UltiMate 3000 RSLC (Thermo Scientific Dionex) and
the mass spectrometer was an amaZon speed ETD (Bruker Daltonics).
The column was a reversed-phase Acclaim PepMap100 C18 (3 μm
particle size, 100 Å pore size, 300 μm internal diameter
(ID) × 15 cm (length) Thermo Scientific Dionex) with the following:
Buffer A: H2O, 0.1% FA. Buffer B: ACN, 0.1% FA. Loading
solvent: H2O, 0.1% FA. Flow rate: 4 μL/min. For the
determination of GdYFD, the gradient started with 4% B for 5 min,
rising to 15% B in 3 min, then 50% B in 35 min, then 90% B in 1 min
and held for 4 min. The gradient was dropped from 90% B to 4% B and
held for 15 min at the end of the 60 min run. For the determination
of SdYADSKDEESNAALSDFA, the gradient started with
5% B for 5 min, rising to 10% B in 3 min, then 45% B in 32 min, then
90% B in 1 min and held for 4 min. The gradient was dropped from 90%
B to 5% B and held for 15 min at the end of the 60 min run.

Chiral
Analysis—Acid Hydrolysis and Amino Acid Labeling
Acid
hydrolysis was performed on each semipurified peptide fraction
in the vapor phase at 150 °C for 30 min in a CEM Discover microwave
(CEM, Mathews, NC).36 The reactions were
carried out in 6 M DCl in D2O with 0.1% phenol (added to
prevent destruction of tryptophan and other amino acids).37,38 Next, to enhance separation, l- and d-amino acids
were derivatized with FDAA.26,27 The amino acids from
the acid hydrolysates were dried and reconstituted in 25 μL
of 0.5 M NaHCO3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For derivatization,
20 μL of 1 mg/mL FDAA dissolved in ACN were added to these amino
acids and reacted at 60 °C for 3 h. Further details of this process
are included in the Supporting Information.

LC–MS/MS Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) Conditions
for the Detection of Labeled Amino Acids
Solvents and solutes
for chiral analysis were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific.
The LC–MS/MS-MRM setup consisted of an EVOQ Elite Triple Quadrupole
Mass Spectrometer equipped with the Advance UHPLC module (Bruker Daltonics).
The column was a Kinetex 2.6 μm particle Phenyl-Hexyl column,
100 Å pore size, 100 mm (length) × 2.1 mm ID (Phenomenex,
Torrance, CA). A binary solvent system was used (A, 25 mM ammonium
formate; B, methanol; flow rate, 300 μL/min). The gradient started
with 5% B for 2 min, rising to 15% B in 5 min, then 60% B in 5 min
and held for 3 min, then 100% B in 3 min and held for 3 min. The gradient
was dropped from 100% B to 5% B toward the end of the 24 min run.
The EVOQ source parameters were as follows: HESI, spray voltage (±)
3500 V; cone temperature, 250 °C; cone gas flow, 20; heated probe
temperature, 400 °C; probe gas flow, 45; nebulizer gas flow,
50; exhaust gas, Off. EVOQ MRM chromatograms were analyzed using Data
Review 8.2 (Bruker Daltonics). A standard mixture of the achiral amino
acid glycine and the l- and d-forms of the 19 common
chiral amino acids was derivatized and used in the MRM to establish
a table of retention times.

Electrophysiology
Intracellular and extracellular recordings
of the physiological activity from Aplysia central
nervous system preparations (either the cerebral and buccal ganglia,
or the cerebral and pedal ganglia) were performed as described previously.7,35,39,40 The ganglia were desheathed, transferred to a recording chamber
containing 1.5 mL of artificial seawater (ASW) (460 mM NaCl, 10 mM
KCl, 11 mM CaCl2, 55 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM HEPES,
pH 7.6), continuously perfused at 0.3 mL/min, and maintained at 14–17
°C. Peptides were dissolved in ASW immediately before each physiological
test, and the peptide/ASW solution was perfused into the recording
chamber. As noted in the Results and Discussion section, some experiments were also performed in high divalent (HiDi)
saline (368 mM NaCl, 8 mM KCl, 13.8 mM CaCl2, 115 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.6), which increases the spiking threshold
of neurons and therefore curtails polysynaptic influences. Intracellular
recordings were obtained using 5–10 MΩ sharp microelectrodes
filled with 0.6 M K2SO4 plus 60 mM KCl.

To test the peptide effects on the feeding circuit, we included cerebral
and buccal ganglia. The buccal ganglion innervates the feeding organ
(radula). Feeding motor programs were monitored by cyclic bursts in
the I2 nerve of the buccal ganglion.41,42 To test the
peptide effects on the locomotor circuit, we included cerebral and
pedal ganglia. The pedal ganglion innervates the foot. Locomotor programs
were monitored by cyclic bursts in the parapedal commissural nerve
of the pedal ganglion.43−45 Electrophysiological recordings were digitized on
line using AxoScope software (version 9, Molecular Devices, LLC, Sunnyvale,
CA) and plotted with CorelDRAW (version 11, Corel Corporation, Ottawa,
ON, Canada). Bar graphs were plotted using SigmaPlot (version 10,
Systat, San Jose, CA). Data are expressed as mean ± SE. All statistical
tests (e.g., repeated measures one-way analysis of variance) were
performed using Prism (version 5, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).
When the data showed significant effects in analysis of variance,
further individual comparisons were performed with Bonferroni’s
correction.

Behavioral Studies
Peptide effects
on locomotor behavior
were examined with the method and software described recently.40 Each video recording session used to calculate
the locomotor path lasted for 25 min. One notable difference with
the previous work was that we used a round behavior box (diameter,
∼43 cm and height, ∼18 cm) instead of the square behavioral
box used previously (see Figure S8A). We
have not observed obvious differences in locomotor behavior between
the two boxes.

Results and Discussion
Discovery Funnel
The three stages of the discovery
funnel involve screening, chiral analysis, and confirmation (Figure 1). The goal of the
first step is to identify suspected DAACPs for follow-up studies,
where it is acceptable for the first step to have false positives,
but it cannot require peptide standards (as it is not practical to
create standards for all possible DAACPs). Thus, we used enzymatic
screening of peptides with APM (Figure 1, stage 1). DAACPs are expected to resist degradation
by peptidases, and indeed APM has been previously shown to degrade
peptides containing only l-amino acids at a higher rate than
DAACPs.25 We observed a distinct difference
in the rates at which the all-l-peptides and their corresponding
DAACPs were degraded, as demonstrated with GFFD and GdFFD. GFFD was
rapidly degraded within 5 h, whereas GdFFD was virtually intact after
24 h (Figure 1, stage
1), verifying that APM is effective for the screening of potential
DAACPs.

Identifying potential DAACPs by resistance to APM digestion
generates false positives because in addition to isomerization, specific
N-terminal residues and select PTMs increase the resistance to APM
digestion. For example, peptides with proline at the N-terminus can
resist APM digestion.25 In addition, although
every d-amino acid-containing neuropeptide discovered so
far has had isomerization occur at the second residue from the N-terminus,
this does not preclude the possibility of isomerization occurring
at a different residue near the N-terminus.5,6 Ultimately,
the limitations of the first step make the subsequent steps in our
method necessary.

The second step is designed to confirm the
presence of d-amino acids in suspected peptides and so reduces
the number of false
positives. First, acid hydrolysis is performed in the vapor phase,
which hydrolyzes the peptide into its component amino acids.36 While there are several possible chromatographic
methods, including chiral LC, we derivatized l- and d-amino acids with Marfey’s reagent to ensure good separation
of all chiral amino acids in one analysis (Figure S1 and Table S1),26,27 and detected them with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer.

Interestingly, following DCl-based acid hydrolysis and analysis,
labeled tyrosine (Tyr) was seen to have a different molecular weight
than expected: two more Daltons than the label plus Tyr (Figure S2).37,46 For more details,
see the Supporting Information (page S-4,
the use of DCl/D2O for acid hydrolysis and its effect on
the detection of labeled amino acids). This mass shift raises the
possibility of other unknown changes during DCl hydrolysis that can
be observed with MS, which may account for losses of intensity of
certain species. DCl hydrolysis may not be able to analyze all sequences,
as there are amino acids that are destroyed (or modified) by acid
hydrolysis.47 Short, high temperature vapor-phase
hydrolysis mitigates this, but with low enough levels of neuropeptide,
this may not always be sufficient. Also, certain sequences do not
hydrolyze readily, such as chains of some aliphatic amino acids.

The final step of the discovery funnel validates the DAACP and
involves synthesizing the putative peptide in both the all l-form and the d-form. One way to verify structure is to
compare LC retention times between endogenous and synthetic peptides.
In combination with high quality MS/MS data,15 a matching retention time from the LC separation for the native
peptide and a synthetic DAACP is sufficient to confirm the identity
of a DAACP (Figure 1, stage 3).5,6

Screening: Peptides from
apALNP Resist Digestion to Aminopeptidase
M
apALNP is predicted to produce several peptides and in
situ hybridization has indicated that apALNP is localized in a cluster
of neurons in the pedal ganglia.7 This
led us to consider that further DAACP discovery could be facilitated
by targeting the pedal ganglia, as the isomerizing enzyme is inferred
to be expressed by some neurons of this ganglia (the enzyme is currently
unknown). Extracts from pedal ganglia were subjected to 48 h of APM
digestion. After digestion, several peptides were seen to resist degradation,
including GYFD (Figure 2) and SYADSKDEESNAALSDFA (Figure S3).

Figure 2 LC–MS/MS characterization of GdYFD, which is confirmed by
comparing to the retention time of standards. (A) Left, LC–MS
(base peak chromatogram) trace of endogenous GYFD after 48 h of APM
digestion, with a retention time of 15.9 min. Right, the MS/MS fragmentation
with fragment assignments is shown. (B) Left, an LC–MS trace
of the all-l-amino acid synthetic GYFD, with a retention
time of 14.5 min. Right, the MS/MS fragmentation with fragment assignments.
(C) Left, an LC–MS trace of the synthetic DAACP GdYFD, with
a retention time of 15.9 min. Right, MS/MS fragmentation with fragment
assignments is shown. The matching retention time of the synthetic
GdYFD standard with the endogenous GYFD demonstrates that the sequence
for the endogenous peptide is in fact GdYFD.

Both of these peptides are derived from apALNP. Considering
that
GdFFD is also present on this prohormone, these were promising hits
that demonstrated the potential ability of this approach to discover
novel DAACPs. GFFD was also detected after APM digestion, but was
not explored further as it is a previously characterized DAACP (data
not shown).7,15 GYFD and GFFD are also homologous
and differ only in the second residue. The isomerized residues Tyr
and phenylalanine (Phe) are both aromatic amino acids. Thus, it would
not be surprising that GYFD could also exist as GdYFD. Importantly,
the peptide was not targeted for its homology, but was chosen here
for further studies based on APM screening. While this peptide was
not identified in MALDI-TOF profiling of the neurons expressing apALNP
previously,7 here we detected GYFD using
MALDI-TOF/TOF from isolated neurons (Figure S4).

GFFD and GYFD are similar, but there are several longer
peptides
in apALNP.7 The other observed peptide,
SYADSKDEESNAALSDFAED, bears some sequence homology
in its N-terminus to GYFD. Interestingly, a form of this peptide truncated
by two C-terminal amino acids (SYADSKDEESNAALSDFA) was
also seen to resist digestion by APM after 48 h (Figure S3) and was identified in previous work.7 In addition, GFFamide was detected, which has
not previously been reported as an observed peptide from apALNP. However,
this peptide was digested by APM (Figure S5), suggesting it is not a DAACP.

Chiral Analysis: Detection
of d-Amino Acids in Peptides
Resistant to Digestion
Endogenous GYFD and SYADSKDEESNAALSDFA
were purified to relative homogeneity (Figures 2 and S6), seen
to contain a d-Tyr following chiral analysis (Figure 3), and confirmed with synthetic
GdYFD and SdYADSKDEESNAALSDFA (Figures 2 and 4). Thus, we have added
two new DAACPs to the products from apALNP. In Figure 3, the l-amino acids suggest the
presence of additional peptides in the fraction containing l-amino acids. These may be low levels of the epimeric peptide, which
can be somewhat difficult to separate through fraction collection.
While the epimeric peptides were not detected with LC–MS, the
TQ-MS channels are especially sensitive to several amino acids over
others, based on fragmentation energies (see Figure S1; equimolar d- and l-tyrosine favors detection
of l-tyrosine, with sometimes dramatic effects, as seen in
detection of l- and d-threonine).

GYFD is seen to contain a d-Tyr. This suggests that the endogenous
peptide exists as GdYFD. (D) An endogenous peptide fraction containing
SYADSKDEESNAALSDFA is seen to contain a d-Tyr.
This suggests that the endogenous peptide exists as SdYADSKDEESNAALSDFA.

Figure 4 Through spiking of synthetic standards, endogenous
SYADSKDEESNAALSDFA
is seen to exist as a DAACP, SdYADSKDEESNAALSDFA, in the A. californica nervous system. (A) LC–MS (base peak
chromatogram) of synthetic peptides of SYADSKDEESNAALSDFA
(21.6 min) and SdYADSKDEESNAALSDFA (22.4 min) demonstrates
that both peptides separate. (B) LC–MS (base peak chromatogram)
of the endogenous SYADSKDEESNAALSDFA spiked with
either synthetic SYADSKDEESNAALSDFA (black trace) or SdYADSKDEESNAALSDFA
(red trace). Black trace: Spiking SYADSKDEESNAALSDFA results
in two peaks corresponding to 21.6 and 22.4 min; the endogenous peptide,
the second peak, matches the retention time of the DAACP. This is
confirmed in the red trace where spiking SdYADSKDEESNAALSDFA
results in one larger peak at 22.4 min, the additive intensity of
the endogenous peptide and the standard. This confirms that the endogenous
peptide is in fact SdYADSKDEESNAALSDFA.

The discovery of GdYFD and SdYADSKDEESNAALSDFA
as DAACPs has several interesting implications for DAACP formation.
This is the first instance of an endogenous DAACP containing d-Tyr. In contrast, the peptide GFFamide is not isomerized; as both
GFFamide and GFFD have Phe in the second position, and yet GdFFamide
has not been detected, perhaps the ability of the enzyme to isomerize
the peptide involves the flanking sequences, as has been noted in
the frog enzyme.48 However, GYFD, GFFD,
and NWFamide are sequences that are recognized by the isomerase, while
GFFamide is not. Perhaps GdFFamide does not extract under the protocols
used, or perhaps it was simply below the limit of detection; therefore,
the presence of GdFFamide cannot be precluded.

Our results are
defining the endogenous substrates used by a yet
unknown isomerizing enzyme in Aplysia. It appears
to be flexible in regards to sequence and also length. After all,
GdFFD is only 4 amino acids versus the 20 amino acids of SdYADSKDEESNAALSDFAED.
This is consistent with studies of the frog enzyme: substrate specificity
studies showed the frog isomerase was able to act upon sequences of
only the N-terminus of the peptide.48

GdYFD is Bioactive in the Feeding and Locomotor Circuits of A. californica, whereas SdYADSKDEESNAALSDFA
is Not
Previous work has shown that GdFFD is bioactive in
both Aplysia feeding7 and
locomotor40 circuits, whereas the all l-amino acid epimer, GFFD is not. We therefore tested whether
GdYFD and SdYADSKDEESNAALSDFA may also be bioactive in
the feeding and locomotor circuits. Only GdYFD was found to be bioactive
in the feeding (Figure 5) and locomotor networks (Figures S7 and S8). (For further description of these results, see the page S-5 of
the Supporting Information).

Figure 5 GdYFD was bioactive
whereas GYFD was not in the A. californica feeding
circuit (with cerebral and buccal ganglia). (A) Perfusion
of GdYFD increased activity in the cerebral and buccal ganglia (A2)
in a concentration-dependent manner (A4, group data). Protraction,
open bar; retraction, filled bar. Radula closer B8 was mostly active
during protraction, so the programs were egestive. Note that B65 is
strongly active in A2. (B, C) Both GdFFD (B) and GdYFD (C) increased
B65 excitability in a concentration-dependent manner. Bars in B1 and
C1 indicate current injections in B65. (B2 and C2) Group data. (D)
GYFD at 10–5 M had no effects on motor programs
elicited by stimulation of CBI-2 (9 Hz) (D2). (E) GdYFD at 10–6 M made CBI-2-elicited motor programs less ingestive
(E2): that is, it reduced protraction duration (E4) and reduced B8
activity during retraction (E7). Experiments were performed in ASW,
except B and C, which were performed in HiDi saline. Bonferroni post
hoc test is as follows: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.

The physiological data showed that of the two new
DAACPs identified
from apALNP, only GdYFD is bioactive, whereas the other is not. In
addition, for GdYFD, similar to our previous study with GdFFD,7 only the DAACP, that is, GdYFD, is active, whereas
GYFD is not. Finally, our data also suggest that the overall effects
of GdYFD and GdFFD in both the feeding and locomotor circuits are
similar, but the effects of GdYFD may be weaker than GdFFD, particularly
the effects on CBI-2 programs (Figure 5F) and on fictive locomotor programs (Figure S7). Given that each apALNP produces three copies of
GdFFD, whereas it only produces one copy of GdYFD, the main bioactivity
of the peptides from apALNP likely originates from GdFFD. Nonetheless,
our discovery funnel does provide an effective means to identify functionally
important DAACPs from multiple peptides originating from a single
precursor.

Conclusions
We developed and validated
a series of protocols we term a DAACP
discovery funnel, and used it to identify two novel d-amino
acid-containing neuropeptides in the nervous system of A.
californica: GdYFD and SdYADSKDEESNAALSDFA.
This method is nontargeted and does not require the use of bioactivity
to identify novel DAACPs. APM digestion takes advantage of a common
property of neuropeptide DAACPs: that the modification is found near
the N-terminus.25 Although the individual
methods have been used in various contexts, this is the first time
that these methods have been combined into a cohesive workflow and
optimized for the purpose of endogenous peptide discovery.

We
improved every aspect of these methods, most notably, using
triple quadrupole MS for the sensitive detection of low levels of d-amino acids, as is necessary for low levels of neuropeptides.
Because we separate the l- and d-forms into different
fractions, the ratio of the l-d forms is less important,
but the absolute amount of the DAACP must be high enough to characterize
with MS. We do note a limitation of this approach: it assumes that
the modification occurs near the N-terminus; if the modification occurs
near the C-terminus, our method could miss it. Carboxypeptidases may
be studied in the future to see if they can achieve the kind of selectivity
that is seen with APM. Perhaps APM may yet be shown to have the capability
to degrade certain DAACP sequences more rapidly than anticipated,
leading to false negatives.

Regardless, using this approach,
further DAACP discovery efforts
are underway in other models, including vertebrates. We are actively
determining the extent to which post-translational amino acid isomerization
is found in the nervous systems of animals. In Aplysia, novel peptide precursors have recently been identified.49−52 Our approach can determine if there are multiple DAACPs from a single
precursor, especially those peptides with little or no bioactivity.
In mammals, although most bioactive DAACPs are exogenous, several
are reported to have effects; for example, dermorphin acts upon opioid
receptors and has a higher potency than morphine.53,54 Discovery of new DAACPs may provide novel biologics for therapeutic
use, and should help in the hunt for the enzymes responsible for this
modification.
