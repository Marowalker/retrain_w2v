A novel
environment-sensitive probe S2 with turn-on switch for
Human Ether-a-go-go-Related Gene (hERG) potassium channel was developed
herein. After careful evaluation, this fluorescent probe showed high
binding affinity with hERG potassium channel with an IC50 value of 41.65 nM and can be well applied to hERG channel imaging
or cellular distribution study for hERG channel blockers. Compared
with other imaging techniques, such as immunofluorescence and fluorescent
protein-based approaches, this method is convenient and affordable,
especially since a washing procedure is not needed. Meanwhile, this
environment-sensitive turn-on design strategy may provide a good example
for the probe development for these targets that have no reactive
or catalytic activity.

==== Body
For humans,
the information
seen by our naked eyes could be trusted. In fact, most things in organisms
do not have a signal to be visualized. Therefore,
a lot of labeling techniques have been developed, including radioisotopes,
fluorescent probes, dye staining, bioluminescence, and chemiluminescence.
Currently, these techniques are useful tools to study the physiological
process, and each has its advantage. Thus, because of their unique
properties, such as high sensitivity and flexibility and convenient
operation, small molecule fluorescent probes have a wide range of
applications, such as using bioorthogonal reactions to label protein,1 directly detecting and imaging enzyme, receptor,
ion channel, DNA, RNA, bioactive small molecules (H2S,
H2O2, etc.), or others,2−5 and tracing the dynamic process
at the cell or animal level. Especially, a near-infrared probe was
used to guide surgery in a clinical application.6,7

Human Ether-a-go-go-Related Gene (hERG) potassium channel, the
rapid component of the delayed rectified potassium channel, is highly
associated with drug-induced arrhythmias.8 To well analyze the hERG channel, a small-molecule fluorescent probe
may be a powerful tool, which can provide the real-time information
in living systems, and also minimally influence the native properties
of the hERG channel. Currently, several types of small molecule fluorescent
probes for the hERG channel were reported,9 including potential sensitive probes (DiSBAC4(3), DiSBAC2(3), CC2-DMPE/DiSBAC2(3),
CC2-DMPE/DiSBAC4(3), FMP dye) and Tl+ and K+ sensitive probes. These probes have been well applied in hERG channel
inhibitor screening. However, the selectivity of these probes for
the hERG channel is rather lower, which limited their further application.
Therefore, developing selective fluorescent probes for the hERG potassium
channel is very meaningful. Now, there are few such probes, and one
example is a fluorescent derivative of dofetilide, which is used for
the hERG channel inhibitory activity assay based on the fluorescent
polarization (FP) method.10 However, this
probe has no off–on fluorescence switch in its structure, which
may increase the background signal when imaging. Hence, we subsequently
tried our best to develop novel probes with different off–on
mechanisms. In our previous work, we have developed two types of small
molecule fluorescent probes for the hERG channel based on a PET off–on
mechanism,9,11 which were well applied in cell-based hERG
channel inhibitors screening and hERG channel imaging. In this article,
we hope to introduce another novel off–on mechanism in the
structure, further improve the activity of the probes, and also explore
their promising application thereof.

As we know, unlike enzymes
and active small molecules that can
utilize their catalytic or reactive activity to design a turn-on switch,
for those targets with no reactive or catalytic activity, introducing
a fluorescent turn-on switch is challenging. Now, it is well studied
that a hydrophobic interaction between the ligands and the Tyr 652
or Phe 656 residue of hERG channel plays a critical role for the high
binding affinity.8 Therefore, we can speculate
whether we can utilize an environment-sensitive fluorophore to sense
this hydrophobic interaction. In fact, this solvatochromic off–on
mechanism has already been explored to detect protein conformation
dynamics, protein–protein interaction, and structural characterization
of the ligand-binding domain,12−14 which was realized by incorporating
a fluorescent environment-sensitive synthetic amino acid to the peptide
or protein. In addition, there are several small-molecule fluorescent
probes with were reported to detect the hydrophobic pocket based on
the environment-sensitive fluorophores, such as 6-dimethylaminonaphthalene
(DAN) derivatives, 1,8-anilinonaphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS), and
4-sulfamonyl-7-aminobenzoxadiazole (SBD).15−18 Inspired by these proof-of-concept
results, herein we decided to design an environment-sensitive probe
for the hERG channel. In order to obtain a high-affinity probe, Astemizole,
the most potent inhibitor of the hERG channel, was chosen as the recognition
motif. Considering that small volume fluorophore may minimally influence
the binding affinity of the parent ligand, a relative small fluorophore
SBD was designed to be incorporated into the structure of Astemizole.
In the classical design strategy, the fluorophore was not involved
in the binding with the target protein so that the binding activity
of the parent ligand was decreased more or less. Therefore, in our
design strategy, the fluorophore together with Astemizole was the
recognition motif (Scheme 1A). According to the reported binding mode of Astemizole with
the hERG channel, the 4-methoxyphenyl group is involved in the hydrophobic
interaction,19 and therefore, we replaced
this group with SBD fluorophore (Scheme 1A) for retaining the hydrophobic interaction.Scheme 1 (A) Design
Strategy of Probes Based on SBD Fluorophore and Astemizole; (B) Synthesis
Route of the Probes


Subsequently, probes were synthesized through a simple
substitution
reaction as shown in Scheme 1B. The Astemizole motif and SBD fluorophore were prepared
according to the literature (Scheme S1).
Afterward, the inhibitory activities of the probes against the hERG
channel were evaluated using a radio-ligand competitive binding assay.
The experimental result revealed that all probes had high affinities
for the hERG channel (Table 1 and Figure S2), and compared with
our previous reported probes, the activity was greatly improved. When
the length of the linker between the fluorophore and piperidine ring
is four-carbon, the activity is the best with an IC50 value
of 14 nM, which is comparable to Astemizole (12 nM). Meanwhile, a
fluorescent polarization assay was also conducted to determine the
binding affinity. It was found that the FP value was greatly augmented
with the increase of the cell membrane, indicative of an efficient
binding (Figure S5). Therefore, in the
following experiment, probe S2 was selected for further activity evaluation.

As described
above, probe S2 has a high affinity for the hERG channel.
However, whether this activity can translate into a functional inhibition
of potassium current is not clear. Probe S2 was then tested using
the whole-cell voltage patch clamp electrophysiology method on hERG
transfected HEK293 cells. As shown in Figure 1, with the increasing concentration of probe
S2, the hERG potassium current was decreased, and the calculated IC50 value is 41.65 nM, which was also comparable to Astemizole.

blocked by probe S2 (50 nM and 1 μM); (C) the percent inhibition
of the hERG channel current by different concentrations of probe S2;
the IC50 value was calculated by using the GraphPad Prism
5 software.

In our probes, an environment-sensitive
fluorophore SBD was introduced
to sense the hydrophobic interaction within the hERG channel. To validate
this hypothesis, probe S2 was incubated with different concentrations
of hERG-transfected HEK293 cell membrane. As illustrated in Figure 2, the fluorescence
intensity can be significantly enhanced by the increasing amount of
cell membrane. When incubated with 0.8 mg/mL cell membrane, the fluorescence
intensity increased about 6-fold compared with the blank control.
Meanwhile, the quantum yields of probe S2 also increased about 4-times
after binding to 0.0625 mg/mL cell membrane (from 0.0044 to 0.0153, Table S1). Moreover, various concentrations of
cell membrane were designed to be incubated with only SBD moiety.
Different from probe S2, the fluorescent intensity increase of SBD
moiety showed an approximate linear manner and the level of fluorescence
enhancement is also lower than that of probe S2 (Figure S3), which indicated that the fluorescence enhancement
was not just the result from the nonspecific binding of fluorophore
moiety to cell membrane but the specific binding of probe S2 to target
protein. In addition, the maximum emission wavelength of probe S2
was blue-shifted about 5 nm from 550 nm in assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl,
1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl) to 545 nm when membrane was added.
The similar environment-sensitive properties were also observed in
different polarities of the solvent; fluorescence was higher in a
nonpolar solvent and lower in a polar solvent (Figure S1).

Figure 2 (A) Fluorescent emission spectra of 1 μM probe S2
incubated
with different concentrations of the membrane for 20 min (excited
at 435 nm) and (B) fluorescent intensity (normalized based on the
last point that is seen as 1) at 550 nm emission wavelength.

Afterward, the selectivity of
this fluorescence intensity increase
for hERG potassium channel was also explored. In this assay, bovine
serum albumin (BSA) and trypsin, which easily form a nonspecific binding
with small molecules, were selected as the control group. As shown
in Figure 3, probe
S2 demonstrated suitable selectivity against BSA and trypsin. However,
a certain fluorescence increase and about 5 nm blue shift of the maximum
emission wavelength have also been observed for BSA, which indicated
that probe S2 may form some nonspecific binding with BSA. In addition,
the fluorescence intensity increase of probe S2 induced by incubating
with cell membrane can be decreased by Astemizole, a potent hERG channel
inhibitor. However, the fluorescence enhancement could not be completely
suppressed, which may be induced by unavoidable nonspecific binding,
especially the hydrophobic component.

Figure 3 Fluorescent emission spectra (excited
at 435 nm) and fluorescent
intensity changes at the maximum emission wavelength of 1 μM
probe S2 incubated with a 0.5 mg/mL hERG transfected HEK293 membrane,
1 mg/mL trypsin, 1 mg/mL BSA, and a 0.5 mg/mL hERG transfected HEK293
membrane combined with hERG potassium channel inhibitor Astemizole
(100 μM) for 20 min.

To further expand the application potential of our probes,
we also
explored whether probe S2 can be used for hERG channel imaging in
living cells. This study was conducted on hERG-transfected HEK293
cells. The fluorescent microscopy results confirmed that the hERG
channel can be well selectively labeled, while a significant fluorescence
decrease was observed when the cells were coincubated with probe S2
and Astemizole (Figure 4). Notably, a complex washing procedure is not required, which ensures
a very convenient imaging process. Considering that the hERG channel
is a membrane protein, we also conducted TIRF imaging, and a significant
membrane signal can be observed (Figure S6). Interestingly, a lot of light dots in the cytoplasm can be seen,
especially in the TIRF imaging. As probe S2 is an alkaline molecule,
it may be accumulated in the acidic lysosome as other basic drugs,
in which the pH range is 4.5–5. The following costaining experiment
confirmed this (Figure S6). The calculated
colocalization coefficient of probe S2 with a lysosome blue tracer
(synthesized by our lab) is 0.75. Subsequently, chloroquine, a weak
base drug that can be accumulated within lysosome and inhibit the
intralysosomal trapping of drugs, was used to coincubate with probe
S2, and the number of the light dots are also decreased. To exclude
the possibility that this lysosome staining is caused by an off–on
mechanism based on lysosome acidity, such as PET effect, which was
often used as a design strategy for lysosome probe,20 the fluorescent emission spectra was measured in Britton-Robinson
buffer at different pH values. The result demonstrated that there
is almost no fluorescence changes with decreasing pH value (Figure S4). Therefore, the specific lysosome
staining may be mainly due to the accumulation of probe S2 in the
lysosome, which resulted in the concentration of probe S2 in lysosome
being very high, and then, lysosome was stained. This drug accumulation
phenomenon is also observed for ABL1 tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (imatinib
and nilotinib) using a quantitative hyperspectral stimulated Raman
scattering technique, in which drugs were enriched over 1000-fold
in lysosomes.21 This is similar to the
results obtained from H3-labeled Astemizole.22 Therefore, to a degree, the distribution of probe S2 reflected the
distribution of Astemizole in cells, and this result may give us some
hint that we may design a probe through incorporating a fluorophore
to the ligand structure and then use it to explore the pharmacokinetics
of the drug with a similar scaffold.

In conclusion, we developed a high-affinity environment-sensitive
probe S2, which can be applied for hERG channel imaging with low background
signal. Compared with our previous reported probes, the inhibitory
activity was greatly improved from micromolar to nanomolar level.
Meanwhile, compared with other imaging techniques, such as immunofluorescence
and fluorescent protein-based approaches, this method is convenient
and affordable, especially since a washing procedure is not needed
due to the environment-sensitive switch in the structure. These turn-on
design strategies may provide good examples for the probe development
for these targets that have no reactive or catalytic activity. In
addition, we also found that probe S2 may be used to trace the distribution
of Astemizole in live cells. In fact, there have already been several
probes reported, which were used to study the relationship between
the chemical structure and subcellular location, the cellular distribution
of drugs, and the distribution of the drugs in vivo.23−25 Therefore, our probe may have a promising application in a hERG
channel associated study in the future. However, there are still more
efforts to be undertaken, especially in the development of a near-infrared
probe for the hERG channel, which may be applied to in vivo study.
