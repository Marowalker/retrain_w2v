Diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common B-cell
non-Hodgkin lymphoma. To treat this aggressive disease, R-CHOP, a
combination of immunotherapy (R; rituximab) and chemotherapy (CHOP;
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), remains
the most commonly used regimen for newly diagnosed DLBCLs. However,
up to one-third of patients ultimately becomes refractory to initial
therapy or relapses after treatment, and the high mortality rate highlights
the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches based upon selective
molecular targets. In order to understand the molecular mechanisms
underlying relapsed DLBCL, we studied differences in the lipid and
metabolic composition of nontreated and R-CHOP-resistant tumors, using
a combination of in vivo DLBCL xenograft models and mass spectrometry
imaging. Together, these techniques provide information regarding
analyte composition and molecular distributions of therapy-resistant
and sensitive areas. We found specific lipid and metabolic profiles
for R-CHOP-resistant tumors, such as a higher presence of phosphatidylinositol
and sphingomyelin fragments. In addition, we investigated intratumor
heterogeneity and identified specific lipid markers of viable and
necrotic areas. Furthermore, we could monitor metabolic changes and
found reduced adenosine triphosphate and increased adenosine monophosphate
in the R-CHOP-resistant tumors. This work highlights the power of
combining in vivo imaging and MSI to track molecular signatures in
DLBCL, which has potential application for other diseases.

Diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma
(DLBCL) is the most common B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL)
throughout the world, comprising 30–35% of all NHLs, with approximately
72 580 new cases and 20 150 deaths estimated for 2016.1 Implemented 20 years ago, R-CHOP, a combination
of immunotherapy (R: rituximab, targeting the cell surface protein
CD20 expressed by B-cell lymphoma) and chemotherapy (CHOP: cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), remains the most commonly
used regimen for newly diagnosed advanced DLBCLs. This therapy has
considerably improved treatment response,2−5 but DLBCL is a biologically aggressive
disease and up to one-third of patients becomes refractory to initial
therapy6 and displays a poor survival outcome.7,8

The high mortality rate in patients with relapsed DLBCL highlights
the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches based upon selective
molecular targets. Therefore, it is of high importance to enhance
our understanding of the various mechanisms leading to tumor resistance/relapse
in order to develop efficient therapies against refractory/relapsing
DLBCL. To do so, two criteria are critical, (i) to precisely monitor
DLBCL cells’ response to R-CHOP treatment and tumor progression,
and (ii) to analyze global and local molecular tumor profiles in relation
to treatment response.

Implemented for the first time two decades
ago, live in vivo bioluminescent
imaging (BLI) has allowed researchers to detect living cells in rodents
in a noninvasive manner.9 Cells are genetically
modified in order to express a luciferase enzyme, which, after injection
of luciferin in the animal, will lead to the emission of a luminescent
signal. This signal is then acquired and quantified by an in vivo
imaging system (IVIS). Of note, in cancer xenograft models, it also
allows precise monitoring and quantification of tumor development
from earlier stages and more accurately than caliper measurements.10 Moreover, in the past decade, scientists have
generated lentiviral vectors coupling fluorescent markers and luciferase,
allowing for the stable generation of luminescent variants of almost
any cancer cell line.11 Such models have
been previously shown to efficiently monitor lymphoma cells reaction
to treatment in murine models.12

Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is an analytical tool capable of
identifying and mapping hundreds of molecules in a single experiment
from thin, biological sections. MSI differs from other imaging techniques
as it is a label-free method used to study molecules ranging from
proteins and peptides13 to lipids,14 metabolites,15 and
drugs.16 MSI is commonly used to study
and characterize different types of cancer.17,18

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) is one
of the
main ionization techniques used in the MSI field. A thin layer of
matrix is deposited on-top of the sample in order to help ionization
and desorption of the molecules. Then, a laser shoots across the tissue
section recording the biomolecular profile (mass-to-charge ratio and
relative intensity) of each acquired position. Dedicated software
allows the generation of images at a given pair of x- and y-coordinates. MALDI-MSI19 offers a very high spatial resolution (up to 1–5
μm)20,21 and an acquisition speed of 50 pixels per
second,22 providing histological information
at the biomolecular level.

Recent studies have demonstrated
the advantages of combining in
vivo imaging and MSI in cancer research. Indeed, Hinsenkamp et al.
demonstrated the potential of the ROCK1/2 inhibitor Fasudil in a gastric
cancer model either by positron emission tomography–computed
tomography (PET/CT) in vivo imaging or MALDI-MS imaging.23 Jiang et al. have identified specific lipid
profiles of hypoxic regions in a breast cancer model by combining
bioluminescence in vivo imaging and MSI.24 In this work, we demonstrate the potential of using BLI to follow
the response to R-CHOP treatment and MALDI-MSI to characterize the
molecular profiles of resistant tumors.

Our results reveal distinctive
signatures of lipids and metabolites
in R-CHOP-resistant lymphoma tumors that could help to identify new
targets involved in treatment resistance. Furthermore, our studies
demonstrate that BLI–MALDI-MSI combined can be applied to study
molecular and metabolic progression of many other diseases.

Experimental
Section
The U2932 DLBCL cell line was obtained from American
Type Culture
Collection, USA. A luminescent and fluorescent variant of the cell
line was generated, on the basis of the pFULT lentiviral system, as
previously published (details in the Supporting Information).24,25

Generation of DLBCL Xenografts
The 107 freshly
harvested U2932 pFULT cells (200 μL from a stock solution of
5 × 107 cells/mL in PBS) were subcutaneously injected
in the right flank of 40 NMRI-nude adult females (Janvier Laboratories,
France). Following injection, in vivo luminescence imaging was used
to follow tumor development using an IVIS Lumina II (Caliper Life
Sciences, USA). Mice were checked daily to detect any sign of discomfort
or sickness and sacrificed by cervical dislocation if such condition
would appear. Of the 40 injected mice, 33 developed tumors and did
not present any side-effects. Of these 33 tumorous mice, 5 were left
untreated as controls, and 28 were treated with an R-CHOP regiment
once the tumor had reached a total luminescence signal of at least
3 × 1010 photons/second. One cycle of R-CHOP therapy
was defined as three consecutive repeats of a weekly procedure, from
indicated time-points, based on published protocols.26,27 One procedure consists of a single Rituximab (MabThera subcutaneous,
Roche, Switzerland) subcutaneous injection on day 1, dosed at 25 mg/kg
combined with CHOP treatment as follows: cyclophosphamide (Sigma-Aldrich,
C0768, USA) intraperitoneal (i.p.), day 2, dosed at 40 mg/kg; doxorubicin
(Sigma-Aldrich, D2975000, USA), i.p., day 2, dosed at 3.33 mg/kg;
vincristine (Sigma-Aldrich, V0400000, USA) i.p., day 2, dosed at 0.2
mg/kg; and prednisone (Sigma-Aldrich, P6254, USA), oral gavage from
day 1 to 5 inclusive, dosed at 0.2 mg/kg. The tumors were harvested
and immediately heat-stabilized (Stabilizor System, Denator, Sweden)
in order to preserve their molecular integrity before being snap-frozen
in isopentane and then stored at −80 °C until MSI analysis.

Mass Spectrometry Imaging
The 12 μm consecutive
sections were used in order to obtain technical triplicates of each
tumor and type of MSI experiment (lipids positive mode, lipids negative
mode, and metabolites).

Lipid Analysis
Prior to matrix application,
the samples
were dried for 15 min. Norharmane (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK)
matrix was applied to sections at 7 mg/mL in 2:1 chloroform:methanol
(v/v) using the TM-Sprayer M3 (HTX Technologies LLC, Carrboro, USA).
Eleven layers were applied with a drying time of 30 s between each
layer using a nozzle temperature of 30 °C with a flow rate of
120 μL/min. The velocity was set at 1200 mm/min combined with
a track passing of 3 mm allowing homogeneous matrix application.28

Metabolite Analysis
N-(1-Naphthyl)
ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NEDC) (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham,
UK) matrix was applied to sections at 7 mg/mL in 70% methanol (v/v).
The spray parameters were the same as for the lipids with the only
difference that the nozzle temperature was set to 85 °C. 9-Aminoacridine
hydrochloride monohydrate (9AA) (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham UK) matrix
was applied at 7 mg/mL in 70% ethanol (v/v) using the SunCollect (SunChrom,
Friedrichsdorf, Germany). Twenty layers were applied with a flow rate
of 40 μL/min and a Z offset of 25 mm. The velocity was set at
1250 mm/min combined with a line distance of 2 mm.

Lipids were
detected using both positive and negative ion polarities and metabolites
only in the negative mode using a Bruker RapifleX MALDI Tissue-typer
instrument operating in reflectron mode (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Germany)
and an Orbitrap Elite hybrid ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Bremen, Germany) (see the Supporting Information).

Imaging Processing
FlexImaging v4.1
(Bruker Daltonik
GmbH, Bremen, Germany) and SCiLS lab 2016b (SCiLS GmbH, Bremen, Germany)
were used to process the imaging data acquired with the Bruker RapifleX.
Thermo Xcalibur 3.0.63 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany)
was used to analyze the Orbitrap imaging data. Principal component
analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), and linear
discriminant analysis (LDA) were performed after peak picking using
an in-house-built ChemomeTricks toolbox for MATLAB version 2014a (The
MathWorks, Natick, USA).29

On-tissue
pixels were selected as regions of interest (ROIs) and assigned to
a category representing the untreated and resistant classes, respectively.
PCA-LDA was performed with one-fourth of the number of features as
the number of functions for the LDA,30 which
were 337 functions for lipids in negative polarity, 338 functions
for lipids in positive polarity, and 357 functions for metabolites.
The scores that described the different discriminant functions (DF)
were adjusted to Gaussian curves following a normal distribution and
projected onto ROIs. DF is a variable that was composed to maximize
the variance between the groups and to minimize the variance within
the groups.

The lipids and metabolites were then identified
using tandem MS
as well as the databases, LIPID MAPS Structure Database (http://lipidmaps.org), ALEX123 lipid
database (http://alex123.info/ALEX123/MS.php),31 METLIN database (https://metlin.scripps.edu), and Human Metabolome Database (http://www.hmdb.ca/).

After acquisition, the tissue sections
were analyzed by fluorescent
microscopy and stained for histological annotation. For more details
about material and methods, please see the Supporting Information.

Results and Discussion
In Vivo Imaging Monitoring
To Follow the Tumor Growth
We selected the U2932 DLBCL cell
line to generate our in vivo model
(Figure 1A), as it
presents a high expression of v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene
homologue (MYC) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2),32 a hallmark of refractory/relapse DLBCL patients.33 Using the pFULT lentiviral system, we generated a variant
of this cell line stably and constitutively expressing luciferase
2 as well as TdTomato (Figure 1A). In a pilot experiment, we validated the possibility of
monitoring tumor development from these xenografts and observed that
tumors should reach a minimum total signal of 3 × 1010 photons/second before starting R-CHOP therapy in order to obtain
refractory/relapsing tumors (data not shown). Then, we injected 40
mice, leading to 33 animals developing tumors without presenting side-effects;
5 control mice were not treated (Figure 1B), presenting constant tumor growth (Figures 1C and S1); and 28 were treated with the R-CHOP regimen.
As our aim was to characterize R-CHOP resistance, we defined resistant
tumors as those presenting regular tumor growth after serial regimens
of R-CHOP treatment (Figure 1D). Under this criterion, 4 of the 28 injected, treated mice
showed R-CHOP-resistant tumors (Figures 1D and S1).

Differential Lipid Profiles between Untreated and Relapsing
Tumors Revealed by MALDI-MSI
Different lipid profiles between
untreated and R-CHOP-resistant tumors were revealed by MALDI-MSI (100
× 100 μm raster size). Both ion polarities allowed for
the visualization of different molecular classes. In negative-ion
mode (Figure 2, Table 1), we detected phosphatidylinositols
(PI), phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), phosphatidylserines (PS), phosphatidylglycerols
(PG), and cardiolipins (CL). Principal component analysis followed
by linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) was used for data reduction
and to look for specific profiles of each condition (Figure 2A).

and R-CHOP-resistant tumors based on the

Table 1 Lipid Assignments Based on MS/MS and
High Mass Resolution MSI Experiments
The DF1 of
lipids in negative mode described 1.5% of the total
variance used for the LDA. The projection of the DF1 scores revealed
different biomolecular profiles for the untreated and resistant tumors
(Figure 2B). Of importance,
different lipid families appeared to be specific to each condition
(Table 1). PI and most
PG species were specific of R-CHOP-resistant tumors, whereas most
PE and CL species were predominantly detected in the untreated condition
(Figure 2A,C). The
higher presence of PI in the relapsed condition is biologically relevant
as phosphoinositide 3-kinase, a key cellular signaling mediator of
this lipid family, which has been shown to be involved in DLBCL pathogenesis
by having a role in protein trafficking34 and is currently being investigated as a target for refractory/relapsed
DLBCL.35 Of note, we also observed some
lipid fragments from sphingomyelins (SM) d18:1_16:0 (m/z 687.54, [M – H]−), exclusively
localized in certain tumor regions.

In the positive-ion mode,
different lipid classes, such as phosphocholines
(PC), SM, and PE, were detected (Table 1). The DF1 was discriminated between the two conditions
(Figure 3A,B), describing
1.1% of the total variance used for the LDA. Likewise, individual
lipids were more abundant in one condition compared to the other (Table 1). For instance, PC
34:2 (m/z 796.53, [M + K]+) was specific to the untreated DLBCL, whereas PC O_38:4 (m/z 834.58, [M + K]+) was more
present in the resistant tumors (Figure 3A,C). Most of the sodiated lipid adducts
were detected in the resistant condition. An interesting case is PC
36:2, predominantly detected as m/z 786.60 [M + H]+ in untreated tumors and as m/z 808.58 [M + Na]+ in the resistant
condition (Table 1).
Other examples are SM (34:1:2) (m/z 725.56, [M + Na]+) (Figure S3) and PC 38:4 (m/z 832.58, [M +
Na]+), found to be more present in the relapsed tumors.
These observations suggest that a higher content of Na+ would be involved in R-CHOP resistance mechanisms. Chughtai et al.36 found that the SM d18:1/16:0 sodium adduct primarily
colocalized with hypoxic and necrotic tumor regions, agreeing with
Irigoyen et al.37 who showed a correlation
between hypoxia with the aggressiveness, metastatic spread, and relapse
of solid tumors.

Tumor Heterogeneity Characterized
by MSI Lipidomic Profiles
Fluorescence microscopy experiments
confirmed that all tumoral
cells expressed TdTomato protein, which was introduced in our DLBCL
human cell line model (Figures 1 and S2). This excluded the possibility
of having resected murine tissue with the tumor. Second, the H&E
stained slides were annotated by a pathologist, and we identified
these areas as necrotic regions (Figure S4A). MSI of the treatment-resistant tumors (tumors 272 and 285) distinguished
between viable and necrotic regions, which were similar to pathologist
annotations in H&E-stained slides (Figure S4). PCA was performed to evaluate specific lipid profiles
linked to these different tumor areas (Figure S4B,C). In order to further study tumor heterogeneity and identify
characteristic lipids of each area, we performed experiments at a
higher spatial (30 μm) and mass resolution (240 000 resolving
power at m/z 400). In Figure 4, individual channels were
plotted to represent the specific lipid distribution in viable and
necrotic parts of resistant tumors. In the negative mode, we were
able to discriminate viable/necrotic areas, with a higher presence
of PI 18:0_20:4 (m/z 885.55, [M
– H]−) in the viable regions, while the SM
d18:1_16:0 fragment (m/z 687.54,
[M – H]−) was a marker for the dead cell
state (Figure 4A).
In the positive mode, we observed that PC 34:2 (m/z 796.53, [M + K]+) was a marker of
the viable but R-CHOP-resistant tumor tissue, whereas LPC 18:0 (m/z 524.37, [M + H]+) was specific
to the necrotic part (Figure 4B). This finding confirms previous studies that detected high
PC levels in non-necrotic tumor regions, revealing importance of PCs
in the following the tumor progression.38 In fact, Glunde et al. described the importance of targeting choline
metabolites for early cancer detection.39

in viable and necrotic regions, respectively, determined by H&E
staining (right). (B) Positive-ion mode images show the spatial distribution
of PC 34:2 (left) and LPC 18:0 (middle), which correlated to viable
and necrotic areas, respectively, again determined by H&E staining
(right).

As mentioned above, most of the
sodiated adducts were assigned
to the resistant condition. In addition, the distribution of these
sodiated species seemed to be specific to the necrotic areas of resistant
tumors; SM (34:1:2) (m/z 725.56,
[M + Na]+) (Figure S3), PC 36:2
(m/z 808.58, [M + Na]+), PC 32:0 (16:0/16:0) (m/z 756.55,
[M + Na]+), and PC 38:4 (m/z 832.58, [M + Na]+) are several examples. Our observations
are in agreement with those of Amstalden van Hove et al., who also
observed higher levels of Na+ in the necrotic tumor regions
by MSI.38 It is possible, that high Na+ levels lead to necrosis, or that this high sodium presence
could be a consequence of the cell death process. These high sodium
levels may also correlate with a decrease in Na+/K+ pump activity and an increase in cell permeability.34,36 Interestingly, higher potassiated lipid species were found in viable
compared to necrotic tissue, such as PC 34:2 (m/z 796.53, [M + K]+). This is supported as well
by Summers et al., who showed that higher K+ levels were
found in viable tumor regions compared to necrotic areas.40 Our results suggest that the presence of sodiated
lipids could indicate a good response to R-CHOP therapy.

Metabolic Changes
in Relapsed DLBCL Tumors
After we
optimized our method for MALDI-MSI detection of small molecules using
9-AA and NEDC,41,42 we observed a higher signal-to-noise
ratio for metabolites, such as adenosine monophosphate (AMP, m/z 346.06), adenosine diphosphate (ADP, m/z 426.02), and adenosine triphosphate
(ATP, m/z 505.99), using NEDC. In
addition, the matrix peaks were less abundant in the mass spectrum
with NEDC compared to 9-AA, which helped to avoid matrix interferences
(Figure S5). NEDC allowed the analysis
of lipids and metabolites in a single experiment. Hence, we performed
analysis targeting metabolites using NEDC at a raster size of 100
μm.

PCA-LDA showed a separation between the untreated
and resistant tumors (Figure 5A). The DF1 described 2.0% of the total variance used for
the LDA. The DF1 score projections looked similar for all triplicates
and molecular classes (Figure S6). In addition,
we identified metabolites that discriminated untreated from R-CHOP
resistant tumors (Figure 5B). As an example, ATP was more abundant in the untreated
sections (Figure 5C),
whereas AMP presented a relatively higher intensity in the viable
areas of the R-CHOP-resistant tumors (Figure S7). Previous studies reported that ATP consumption serves to increase
glucose flux to satisfy the energetic and biosynthetic demands of
a rapidly proliferating cancer cell.43 ATP
production is associated with CLs via the electron transport chain,
which is involved in oxidative phosphorylation,42,43 a more efficient pathway for ATP production than glycolysis.44 We found that most of the CL species were more
abundant in the untreated samples, as shown in the DF spectrum of
the lipids in negative mode (Figure 2A). CLs are a class of mitochondrion-specific anionic
phospholipids and play multiple structural and functional roles in
bioenergetics. According to Kiebish et al., environmental factors,
including necrosis and hypoxia, could alter CL content and/or composition,
which could affect tumor initiation or progression.45 Importantly, CHOP has been suggested to influence metabolism
and the mitochondrial state in lymphoma xenografts in vivo.46,47 Indeed, differences in metabolism and mitochondrial state have been
characterized in lymphoma patients.38,39

of nontreated and R-CHOP-resistant tumors.

peak intensity plots showing a relative predominance of ATP in untreated
tumors.

Regarding glycerophosphocholine,
we observed that this major form
of choline storage (shown as dysregulated in cancer metabolism38,48,49 by others) was specific to resistant
tumors. Interestingly, glycerophosphocholine has been associated with
poor prognosis in breast cancer.50 Our
findings suggest that the highest level of glycerophosphocholine present
in the resistant tumors could be linked to PCs, which were also more
abundant in the resistant tissues. Other groups have described a relationship
between differential biomolecular profiles and cell density, which
might be related to a higher cell division rate in aggressive tumors.51,52

Conclusion
Our approach shows the potential of combining
in vivo imaging and
MSI to investigate molecular differences associated with successful
and nonresponsive cancer treatment. To our knowledge, our study is
the first that combines bioluminescence in vivo imaging, for characterization
of lipids and metabolic profiles associated with R-CHOP resistant
tumors. Moreover, specific molecular signatures could be associated
with intratumor heterogeneity. MSI is a robust tool to discover new
markers and signatures of lymphoma, which could be applied to investigate
other cancers and their specific treatment success/resistance.
