Use
of a heterobifunctional photoactivatable cross-linker, sulfo-SDA
(diazirine), has yielded high-density data that facilitated structure
modeling of individual proteins. We expand the photoactivatable chemistry
toolbox here with a second reagent, sulfo-SBP (benzophenone). This
further increases the density of photo-cross-linking to a factor of
20× over conventional cross-linking. Importantly, the two different
photoactivatable groups display orthogonal directionality, enabling
access to different protein regions, unreachable with a single cross-linker.

Cross-linking/mass
spectrometry
(CLMS) is a widespread method for investigating protein structure
and interactions. Selective cross-linking chemistry is one factor
that limits the current resolution of this approach.1 In CLMS, new covalent bonds are introduced between atoms
near in space but not necessarily close in the sequence of the protein.
These linkages are then detected by mass spectrometry and function
as distance constraints when modeling the structure. Currently data-density
of identified distance constraints is curtailed by the restricted
specificity of homobifunctional N-hydroxysuccinimide
(NHS) ester cross-linkers predominantly used in CLMS analysis, consequently
limiting the level of protein structure detail obtainable. Alternative
cross-linking chemistry, including cysteine specific cross-linking,2,3 zero-length carbodiimide coupling,4−7 acidic specific cross-linking8 and photo-cross-linking4,9−12 has failed to demonstrate significant increases in CLMS data amount,
either alone or in combination.13 The recent
exception is the heterobifunctional, photoactivatable diazirine containing
cross-linker sulfosuccinimidyl 4,4′-azipentanoate (sulfo-SDA),
which greatly increases cross-linked residue pair number identification
in human serum albumin (HSA) from an average of 0.07 links per residue
using NHS-ester based cross-linking14 to
2.5 links per residue using sulfo-SDA.15 This high-density data allows the computation of HSA domain models
from samples of purified protein as well as from crude human blood
serum (RMSD to crystal structure of 2.53 and 3.38 Å, respectively).15

We aimed to assess whether cross-linker
coverage over a protein
could be improved upon by expanding our methods of cross-linking to
include an additional photoactivatable moiety, the benzophenone group.
Benzophenones have previously been used to capture protein interactions
in the context of amino acid analogue incorporation, but this has
typically involved targeting single incorporation sites, limiting
the extent of identified links.16−25 A previous study aimed at comparing exogenous bifunctional cross-linkers
containing different photoactivatable groups, including diazirine
and benzophenone. However, resulting data from using carboxy-benzophenone-succinimide
was sparse, with only 3 links observed and a total lack of identified
links using a diazirine derivative cross-linker.12 An earlier study, having synthesized a benzophenone derivative
cross-linker and it's deuterated equivalent, also identified
3 linked
residue pairs.200 In contrast, when using
the diazirine derivative sulfo-SDA in a previous study, we identified
500 cross-linked residue pairs in purified HSA at 5% FDR.15 We aimed to establish whether the use of a benzophenone
based cross-linker could result in a similarly high number of cross-links
and whether cross-linking site selection would be influenced by the
different chemical nature of the two photoactivatable groups.

Methods
Chemicals
and Materials
The cross-linking reagent sulfo-SDA
was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Rockford, IL). HSA (A8763)
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

Synthesis of
4-(N-Sulfosuccinimidylcarboxy)benzophenone
4-Benzoylbenzoic acid (37 mg, 0.16 mmol) and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide
(50 mg, 0.23 mmol) were stirred in 1 mL
of DMF and to this was added EDC·HCl (40 mg, 0.21 mmol) and the
mixture stirred overnight. Solvents were removed under reduced pressure
and the residue purified using semipreparative RP-HPLC (Agilent 1100
prep-HPLC system equipped with a preparative autosampler (G2260A),
preparative scale pumps (G1361A), a fraction collector (G1364B-prep),
and a multiwavelength UV detector (G13658 MWD with preparative flow
cell)). Material was separated at a flow rate of 20 mL/min on an Agilent
RP-C-18 column (21.2 mm × 150 mm, 10 μm particle size),
using the following method: 0% B for 5 min, 0% to 80% B in 40 min,
80% B for 5 min, 80% to 0% B in 5 min, 0% B for 5 min, with mobile
phase A consisting of water and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and mobile
phase B consisting of acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid)
to yield the title product as a white solid (20 mg, 0.05 mmol, 31%).

Cross-Linking HSA
Cross-linking
was carried out in
triplicate. Aliquots of HSA (15 μg, 0.75 mg/mL) in cross-linking
buffer (20 mM HEPES–OH, 20 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.8) were
cross-linked with either sulfo-SDA or sulfo-SBP, using eight cross-linker-to-protein
ratios (w/w) and UV irradiation times of either 25 or 50 min. In the
case of sulfo-SBP, the cross-linker-to-protein ratios (w/w) used were
0.187:1, 0.25:1, 0.375:1, 0.5:1, 0.75:1, 1:1, 1.5:1, and 2:1. The
equivalent molar ratios of sulfo-SDA were used, which meant that the
cross-linker-to-protein ratios (w/w) used were 0.152:1, 0.203:1, 0.303:1,
0.406:1, 0.606:1, 0.811:1, 1.21:1, and 1.62:1. The cross-linking reaction
was a two-step process. First the cross-linker and protein mixture
was allowed to incubate to initiate incomplete lysine reaction with
the sulfo-NHS ester component of the cross-linker. The diazirine group
was then photoactivated using UV irradiation from a UVP CL-1000 UV
Cross-linker (UVP Inc.) at 365 nm (5 × 8 W). Samples were spread
onto the inside of Eppendorf tube lids to form a thin film, placed
on ice at a distance of 5 cm from the lamp, and irradiated for either
25 or 50 min. The resulting cross-linked mixtures were separated on
a NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gel using MES running buffer and Coomassie
blue stain.

Sample Preparation for Mass Spectrometric
Analysis
Bands corresponding to monomeric HSA were excised
from the gel and
the proteins reduced with 20 mM DTT, alkylated using 55 mM IAA and
digested using trypsin following standard protocols.26 The resulting digests were desalted using self-made C18
StageTips27 prior to mass spectrometric
analysis.

Mass Spectrometry and Data Analysis
Peptides were loaded
directly onto a spray emitter analytical column (75 μm inner
diameter, 8 μm opening, 250 mm length; New Objectives) packed
with C18 material (ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 3 μm; Dr Maisch GmbH,
Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany) using an air pressure pump (Proxeon
Biosystems, Odense, Denmark).28 Mobile
phase A consisted of water and 0.1% formic acid. Mobile phase B consisted
of acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. Peptides were loaded onto the
column with 1% B at 700 nL/min flow rate and eluted at 300 nL/min
flow rate with a gradient: 1 min linear increase from 1% B to 9% B;
linear increase to 35% B in 169 min; 5 min increase to 85% B. Eluted
peptides were sprayed directly into a hybrid linear ion trap-Orbitrap
mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap Velos, Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Peptides were analyzed using a “high/high” acquisition
strategy, detecting at high resolution in the Orbitrap and analyzing
the subsequent fragments also in the Orbitrap. Survey scan (MS) spectra
were recorded in the Orbitrap at 100 000 resolution. The eight
most intense signals in the survey scan for each acquisition cycle
were isolated with an m/z window
of 2 Th and fragmented with collision-induced dissociation (CID) in
the ion trap. 1+ and 2+ ions were excluded from fragmentation. Fragmentation
(MS2) spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap at 7500 resolution. Dynamic
exclusion was enabled with 90 s exclusion time and repeat count equal
to 1. Mass spectrometric raw files were processed into peak lists
using MaxQuant version 1.3.0.529 using
default parameters except the setting for “Top MS/MS peaks
per 100 Da” being set to 100.

Peak lists were subsequently
searched against an HSA sequence database (UniProt P02768) using Xi30 (https://github.com/Rappsilber-Laboratory/XiSearch) for identification of cross-linked peptides. Search parameters
for sulfo-SDA search were MS accuracy, 6 ppm; MS/MS accuracy, 20 ppm;
enzyme, trypsin; specificity, fully tryptic; allowed number of missed
cleavages, four; cross-linker, SDA; fixed modifications, none; variable
modifications, carbamidomethylation on cysteine, oxidation on methionine,
SDA-loop (SDA cross-link within a peptide that is also cross-linked
to a separate peptide). Search parameters for sulfo-SBP were the same
except: cross-linker, BENZO (C14H8O2); fixed modifications, none;
variable modifications, carbamidomethylation on cysteine and oxidation
on methionine. The linkage specificity for sulfo-SDA and sulfo-SBP
was assumed to be at lysine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, and protein
N-termini at one end, with the other end having specificity for any
amino acid residue. False discovery rates (FDR) were estimated following
a modified target-decoy search strategy.26,31,32 Cross-link results from the FDR analysis
with scores at the peptide-spectrum match level and confidence values
at cross-link level are also available in Tables S1 and S2. Cross-links were visualized in the crystal structure
of HSA (PDB|1AO6)33 using PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org).

To
compare the fragmentation behavior of peptides linked with either
sulfo-SDA or sulfo-SBP, we extracted 49 common PSMs that were identified
with both sulfo-SBP and sulfo-SDA. A common PSM is defined through
the sequences of the two peptides in the cross-link, the cross-link
sites and the charge state of the precursor. Next, we performed a
two-sided Mann–Whitney-U tests to check for differences in
the number of b- and y-type fragments (ignoring loss of H2O and NH3).
The tests were highly significant (n = 49, p-value ≤0.01 for the b-ions, and ≤0.001 for
the y-ions, respectively). The mean difference between the number
of b- and y-fragments between sulfo-SDA and sulfo-SBP cross-linked
peptides is 4. Next, the fragmentation preferences in terms of fragment
ion intensities were compared with an adjusted cosine similarity.
Instead of computing the cosine similarity of the complete spectrum
only the relative intensities of shared fragment ions were considered.
The two distributions are clearly distinct indicating conservation
of the preferred bond cleavage during fragmentation.

Results
and Discussion
Herein we report the synthesis and use of
a photoactivatable benzophenone
derivative cross-linker, 4-(sulfosuccinimidylcarboxy)benzophenone
(sulfo-SBP), and compare its behavior in the reactivity with proteins
to that of sulfo-SDA (Figure 1). While fewer links were detected when using sulfo-SBP compared
to sulfo-SDA, complementary photochemistry allowed access to additional
parts of protein structure, previously inaccessible using the diazirine-based
cross-linker only.

Unique cross-linked residue pairs identified using only either sulfo-SBP
or sulfo-SDA and those common to both.

We aimed to benchmark sulfo-SBP against the performance of
sulfo-SDA.
Sulfo-SBP was first synthesized in a one-step coupling procedure from
the corresponding acid (Figure 1B). Purified HSA was cross-linked in a parallel triplicate
experiment with either sulfo-SDA or sulfo-SBP, using equivalent molar
ratios for both cross-linkers (Figure 1C). Cross-linked protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE
(Figure 1D) and the
monomer band of HSA excised, digested by trypsin, and analyzed by
mass spectrometry (MS) (Figure 1C). Total MS acquisition time was 6.3 days for each cross-linker,
consisting of 48 × 190 min acquisitions (compared to 12 days
of acquisition in the previous analysis of HSA15).

Using sulfo-SDA, 792 unique residue pairs were
identified (supported
by 1874 MS spectra) at 5% FDR (using a score cutoff of 5). In contrast,
using sulfo-SBP a total of 173 unique residues pairs were identified
(supported by 356 MS spectra) at 5% FDR (score cutoff = 5) (Figure 1E), of which 66 were
also found using sulfo-SDA and 107 were unique to sulfo-SBP. For comparison,
previous work cross-linking acidic residues and primary amines using
5 different cross-linkers, was based on an average of 52 links per
protein, detected in separate studies.8

Unambiguous linkage site assignment is dependent on adequate
flanking
fragmentation events (Figure 2). Manual validation of peptide spectra matches revealed this
to be the case for 313/792 (40%) sulfo-SDA cross-linked residue pairs
and 55/173 (32%) sulfo-SBP cross-linked residue pairs. Looking further
at cross-linked peptide pairs common to both sulfo-SDA and sulfo-SBP
revealed differences in the numbers of fragments between cross-linkers
(Figure 2C); however,
cosine similarity was high, suggesting the impact was minimal (Figure 2D).

for b-ions, and ***≤ 0.001 for y-ions, respectively). (D) Fragmentation
spectra similarity computed as a simplified cosine similarity and
compared with a random reference distribution.

Cross-link coverage is even across the structure of HSA for
both
cross-linkers (Figure 3). Very few links have Cα-Cα distances in excess of 25
Å, 5.6% for sulfo-SDA (44/776 residue pairs) and 2.9% for sulfo-SBP
(5/172 residue pairs). Although sulfo-SDA has a shorter calculated
backbone distance compared to sulfo-SBP (3.9 Å compared to 5.7
Å as predicted for sulfo-SBP), the data suggests that sulfo-SBP
has a shorter upper limit distance constraint than sulfo-SDA. This
is also demonstrated by 94% of sulfo-SBP linked residue pairs having
Cα-Cα distance less than 20 Å, compared to 86% of
sulfo-SDA residue pairs. The number of identified linked residue pairs
in excess of these proposed upper limits are in agreement with the
5% FDR applied to identifications. Sulfo-SBP data fits well to the
crystal structure of HSA (PDB|1AO6), corroborating with a previous study
that showed benzophenone incorporation into proteins is well tolerated.35 While HSA does have extensive disulfide bridges,
it is not incapable of changing its structure in response to changes
in its surface charge. Changing the pH does result in conformational
changes36 as does protein oxidation.37,38 The close agreement of cross-link data with the crystal structure
suggests that the reduction of charged residues during the initial
anchoring step of the reagent does not noticeably disrupt the native
fold of the protein.

Both cross-linkers are heterobifunctional, with
cross-linking occurring
as a two-step reaction: as an anchoring step, the sulfo-NHS ester
component of each cross-linker reacts, primarily with the amine groups
of lysine residues and protein N-termini, but also with the hydroxyl
groups of serine, threonine, and tyrosine. Second, following UV activation,
the photoactivatable groups react by insertion into available N–H/C–H
bonds at any residue (photo-cross-linking step). Reactivity can therefore
be characterized in terms of both the anchoring and photoreacted sites.
Distinct anchoring residue hotspots within HSA account for up to 46
unique residue pairs for a single hotspot. In total, the top eight
anchoring hotspots (K161, Y162, K183, K186, K214, K223, K456, and
K549) account for 26% of all identified residue pairs (Figure S1). Fewer anchoring lysine residues are
observed with sulfo-SBP than sulfo-SDA at 23/59 and 45/59 lysine residues,
respectively (Figure S1). However, linear
peptides with sulfo-SBP and sulfo-SDA modifications (reacted at the
NHS-ester) were observed for 55 and 57 (out of 59) lysine residues,
respectively, suggesting that the observation of cross-links is not
limited by the anchoring reaction but must depend on the photoreaction.

Both cross-linkers show distinct regional preferences in the photoreaction
step (Figure 3D,E).
This is marked in the case of anchoring residues K223, K236, K565
and residues K160, K161, and Y162 (Figure 3D). Although all these residues have reacted
with both cross-linkers, the reaction has proceeded in opposing directions.
Lysine K565, in particular, was linked to 12 different residues, 5
of which by sulfo-SDA and 7 by sulfo-SBP. Sulfo-SDA linked K565 to
residues in a single loop. In contrast, sulfo-SBP linked K565 to residues
in 4 separate neighboring alpha helices. In the case of anchoring
residue K375 and residues K183, Y185, and K186 (Figure 3E), opposing cross-linking orientation is
also evident. The difference here being that there is also considerable
overlap, with some degree of linker specificity.

There is an
observed cross-linking bias for particular residue
types, which are different for sulfo-SDA and sulfo-SBP (Figure S2). Both cross-linkers disfavor polar
residues (sulfo-SBP more strongly than sulfo-SDA); however, sulfo-SDA
has a preference for acidic residues (Asp, Glu), which are strongly
disfavored by sulfo-SBP. Notably, we identify a bias between the benzophenone
of sulfo-SBP toward methionine residues, which corroborates a previous
study demonstrating a “Magnet Effect” of methionine
residues.39 The benzophenone of sulfo-SBP
has a stronger preference for linking hydrophobic residues than sulfo-SDA,
in particular glycine and phenylalanine residues.

Photo-cross-linking
has emerged as a means to greatly increase
the density of cross-linking/mass spectrometry data, which allows
interrogation of protein structures in very complex environments.15 Alternative photo-cross-linking chemistry can
lead to additional structural insights by accessing protein regions
that are inaccessible with one cross-linker alone. A greater understanding
of how cross-linker chemistry influences cross-linking could enable
design and synthesis of improved and enhanced cross-linkers with a
diverse range of physicochemical characteristics. Ultimately, cross-linking/mass
spectrometry chemistry may become routinely tuned for probing a likely
structure and to determine protein folds.
