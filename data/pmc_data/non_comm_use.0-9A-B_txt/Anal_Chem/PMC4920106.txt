Liver
glycogen represents an important physiological form of energy
storage. It plays a key role in the regulation of blood glucose concentrations,
and dysregulations in hepatic glycogen metabolism are linked to many
diseases including diabetes and insulin resistance. In this work,
we develop, optimize, and validate a noninvasive protocol to measure
glycogen levels in isolated perfused mouse livers using chemical exchange
saturation transfer (CEST) NMR spectroscopy. Model glycogen solutions
were used to determine optimal saturation pulse parameters which were
then applied to intact perfused mouse livers of varying glycogen content.
Glycogen measurements from serially acquired CEST Z-spectra of livers
were compared with measurements from interleaved natural abundance 13C NMR spectra. Experimental data revealed that CEST-based
glycogen measurements were highly correlated with 13C NMR
glycogen spectra. Monte Carlo simulations were then used to investigate
the inherent (i.e., signal-to-noise-based) errors in the quantification
of glycogen with each technique. This revealed that CEST was intrinsically
more precise than 13C NMR, although in practice may be
prone to other errors induced by variations in experimental conditions.
We also observed that the CEST signal from glycogen in liver was significantly
less than that observed from identical amounts in solution. Our results
demonstrate that CEST provides an accurate, precise, and readily accessible
method to noninvasively measure liver glycogen levels and their changes.
Furthermore, this technique can be used to map glycogen distributions
via conventional proton magnetic resonance imaging, a capability universally
available on clinical and preclinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scanners vs 13C detection, which is limited to a small
fraction of clinical-scale MRI scanners.

==== Body
Liver glycogen
represents an
important physiological form of energy storage. In the postprandial
state, the liver takes up approximately one-third of the ingested
glucose,1 the majority of which it stores
as glycogen. In the fasted state or in periods of hypoglycemia, the
liver shifts to glycogen breakdown and glucose release in order to
maintain appropriate levels of glycemia, thereby providing sufficient
glucose to other tissues. These states of glucose uptake or release
are controlled in a reciprocal manner in part by the hormones insulin
and glucagon, primarily via modifications of the activities of the
glycogen synthesizing and degrading enzymes. As such, liver glycogen
metabolism plays a central role in whole body glucose homeostasis,
and its dysregulation is linked to many diseases including diabetes.2−5

While blood glucose levels can be easily measured and used
as diagnostic
biomarker, accurate noninvasive measurements of tissue glycogen concentrations
are inherently challenging, but of considerable interest for basic
scientific and clinical applications. As glycogen is confined to intracellular
locations, robust measurements of liver glycogen content have been
problematic. The biochemical assay of glycogen following a tissue
biopsy is the oldest measurement method, but its invasive nature,
along with the potential for regional variation within the liver,6 has limited the clinical utility of this approach.
The ability to measure glycogen noninvasively in liver and muscle
with 13C NMR spectroscopy was demonstrated approximately
25 years ago.7,8 Numerous subsequent studies in
type I and type II diabetic patients yielded valuable insights into
the dysregulation of both muscle and liver glycogen metabolism in
the diabetic state (e.g., refs (9 and 10)). Despite these advances, in vivo 13C NMR spectroscopy
still remains handicapped by its inherently low signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) due to the low natural abundance and the low gyromagnetic ratio
of the 13C nucleus, as well as the cost of the often required 13C labeled isotopes. Furthermore, the vast majority of clinical
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners lack 13C detection
capability, and clinical adaptation of this technology will likely
remain within the research community only.

Recently, a novel
MRI method for detection of tissue glycogen was
reported11 based on sensing the chemical
exchange of glycogen hydroxyl protons with tissue water. This general
method is relatively straightforward to implement on current MRI imaging
systems, because only proton detection is required (e.g., refs (12 and 13)). However, whether it can reliably
measure physiological concentrations of glycogen and what other factors
affect its accuracy have not been established. In this paper, we report
experiments using perfused livers that evaluate the proposition that
chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST)-based measurements are
able to reliably quantify glycogen levels with high sensitivity.

Proton-based CEST approaches benefit from increased SNR compared
to 13C NMR spectroscopy and also from the wide availability
of 1H MR hardware. The use of CEST-based approaches to
detect other −OH and −NH containing metabolites has
been recently reported for glycosaminoglycans,14 creatine,15 glutamate,16 glucose,17 and 2-deoxy-glucose.18,19 Despite the demonstration of proof of concept for detection of these
metabolites, the optimization, calibration, and quantification (including
glycogen) in the tissue of interest using CEST has, for the most part,
not yet been reported. Furthermore, in the initial report of CEST-based
detection of glycogen,11 there appeared
to be a nonlinear and saturating relationship between the amount of
glycogen and the CEST signal measured in phantoms over the expected
physiological range, calling into question the utility of this approach
for measurements of physiological levels of tissue glycogen. Therefore,
the goal of this study was to measure the relationship between total
liver glycogen (as measured with 13C NMR) and the CEST
MR signal and to demonstrate that appropriate CEST methods can provide
reliable and accurate measurement of liver glycogen. Specifically,
our aims were (1) to optimize the acquisition parameters for CEST
detection of glycogen over the expected physiological range in phantoms,
(2) to use these parameters to perform measurements of perfused liver
glycogen with CEST, and (3) to correlate these measurements with those
obtained with 13C NMR and to investigate the inherent errors
in each of these techniques.

Methods
CEST Background
The basis of CEST detection of glycogen
hydroxyl protons is shown schematically in Figure 1 where the 1H NMR signal from a relatively small
solute pool (glycogen in this case) with exchangeable protons (Figure 1a) can be indirectly detected via saturation with
NMR pulses, transfer of these saturated protons to the hydroxyl functional
groups to water, and subsequent measurement of the attenuation of
the water 1H NMR signal (Figure 1b). The series of water peaks acquired at varied frequency offsets
(ω) of the saturation pulse is typically called a “Z-spectrum”
(Figure 1c) and is used to calculate the magnetization
transfer ratio asymmetry (MTRasym) (Figure 1d) as 1  Here, S represents the water
signal observed at a saturation offset ω from the water resonance,
and S0 is the water signal observed at
a saturation offset far (>20 ppm) from the water resonance. (Note
that we have adopted the standard convention in CEST studies of defining
the water resonance to be 0 ppm.) Most reported measures of CEST are
based on this MTRasym parameter; though for some choices
of the saturation parameters, there may be factors other than exchange
that influence measured values of MTRasym.

NMR Acquisitions
All studies were performed on a Bruker
500 MHz (11.7 T) vertical bore NMR spectrometer using XWin-NMR 3.2
and a 20 mm TXO probe with 13C/31P on the inner
coil and 1H/2H on the outer coil with a custom
fabricated 20 mm NMR tube. Magnetic field lock was provided by a small
(∼0.5 mL) separate sealed tube of D2O placed inside
the 20 mm NMR tube. Natural abundance 13C NMR acquisitions
were performed using a 15° square pulse, 1H broadband
decoupling, an interpulse delay of 560 ms, and 1600 averages (22 min
acquisition time). CEST NMR acquisitions were performed using 32 nonuniformly
spaced frequency offsets as follows: ±9, ±8.5, ±8,
±6, ±4, ±2.5, ±2, ±1.75, ±1.5, ±1.25,
±1, ±0.75, ±0.5, ±0.25, ±0.1, 0, and 40 ppm
from water. These were chosen to facilitate Lorentzian modeling of
the Z-spectrum as described later in the Data Analysis protocol. Saturation pulse power and time for perfused liver studies
were optimized using phantom studies (described below) and were 4
μT and 0.5 s. The total repetition time of the sequence was
30 s, which yielded a total scan time of 20 min.

Phantom Studies
Glycogen (oyster, Sigma-Aldrich P/N
#G8751) was dissolved in a Krebs-Henseleit buffer supplemented with
0.25% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mM palmitate, 0.5 mM glutamate, 0.5
mM glutamine, and 2 mM ATP (final pH = 7.4). As the maximum expected
concentration of liver glycogen is approximately 400 μmol/g
and the maximum expected mouse liver size for these studies was 2
g, phantoms were constructed with up to 800 μmoles of glycogen,
measured as glucose equivalents, in the sensitive volume of the NMR
probe. CEST spectra were acquired with varying saturation pulse powers
and times in order to investigate which combination of parameters
yielded a linear relationship between total glycogen and the numerically
integrated CEST MTRasym area under the curve (AUC), with
maximal dynamic range. It should be noted that these phantom studies
were performed only to determine the optimal saturation pulse parameters
and were not used to calibrate the glycogen CEST signal. This is because
tissue glycogen will likely have different structural (chain length,
branching, protein binding) and relaxation characteristics compared
to glycogen in solution.

Perfused Liver Studies
The animals
were studied under
the purview of an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and
all applicable regulations and laws pertaining to the use of laboratory
animals were followed. The perfused liver procedure has been published
in detail elsewhere20 and is summarized
briefly here. C57/BL6 mice (3–6 months old) were fed either
normal chow or a high fructose diet (Research Diets Inc. #124908i)
for 4–7 days to elevate liver glycogen.21 Mice were anesthetized (Nembutal IP, 50 mg/kg) during the
dark cycle. Following a laparotomy, the portal vein was exposed and
cannulated, and the liver was excised and perfused with a preoxygenated
Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffered solution. The liver was then
placed into a custom 20 mm NMR tube, and the entire assembly was placed
inside the NMR spectrometer. 31P NMR spectroscopy was initially
performed to assess liver viability via ATP and Pi levels. Following
manual shimming adjustments (typical water 1H line width
= 30–50 Hz) and centering of the water frequency, baseline 13C NMR and CEST Z-spectra were acquired and followed by the
addition of glucagon (100 pM) to the perfusate to stimulate glycogenolysis
and thereby provide a range of liver glycogen values to be measured
in a single study. Interleaved 13C NMR and CEST acquisitions
were then performed until liver glycogen reached a level near the 13C NMR detection limit, estimated to be ∼50 μmoles.
This protocol is shown in Figure 2. A total
of 13 perfused liver studies were performed, with each study yielding
1–4 separate glycogen measurements (determined by the starting
glycogen content, glycogen breakdown rate, and LOQ).

Figure 2 Protocol for measurement
of total perfused liver glycogen content
using 13C NMR and CEST. Glucagon administration was used
as a tool to stimulate glycogen breakdown and efficiently generate
a range of liver glycogen values over the course of a single study.

Data Analysis
13C NMR spectra of glycogen
were analyzed with peak fitting programs written in Matlab. Briefly,
the glycogen NMR resonances were each fit to a Lorentzian line shape
model, the parameters of which were optimized using a least-squares
minimization routine. Each modeled resonance was then integrated analytically
and the sum of the areas was converted to an absolute amount of glycogen
by comparison with a standard curve of glycogen phantoms acquired
under identical conditions.

For the CEST acquisitions, all data
analysis was performed using Matlab functions. Z-spectra were calculated
by first numerically integrating each magnitude 1H NMR
spectrum between +2 and −2 ppm from the water resonance (to
avoid the lipid 1H NMR signal) from each saturation frequency
offset. These integrals were then normalized to the corresponding
integral of the 1H NMR signal acquired with a 40 ppm frequency
offset to form the Z-spectrum.

For this particular application,
the Z-spectrum can be considered
as the sum of the CEST contribution and the direct water saturation
(DWS) contribution. Starting from the two-site model of chemical exchange
and incorporating the weak saturation pulse (WSP) approximation,22 it can be shown that the DWS component of the
Z-spectrum is theoretically inverted Lorentzian in shape. Accordingly,
experimental Z-spectra were fit over the nonglycogen signal
containing regions with an inverted Lorentzian model given
by 2  where L0 is a
small DC offset parameter, h is the height, ω0 is the center frequency, and LW is the line width at 50%
peak height. This fit was performed over the nonglycogen signal
containing regions of the Z-spectrum using the following
subset of saturation frequency offsets: ± 9, ±8.5, ±8,
±0.1, 0, −0.25, −0.5, −0.75, −1,
−1.25, −1.5, and −1.75 ppm from water.23 The glycogen MTRasym function was
then calculated as the difference between the modeled DWS spectrum
and the experimental Z-spectrum, i.e., 3  and this glycogen MTRasym curve
was numerically integrated to yield the final measure of glycogen
CEST signal. While this Lorentzian fitting procedure may be subject
to small errors due to the potential inclusion of NOE effects in the
region used to fit the DWS portion of the Z-spectrum, it should be
noted that the direct calculation of the MTRasym (eq 1) would suffer from the same shortcoming. Furthermore,
we observed that this procedure proved superior to the direct calculation
of the MTRasym as it allowed for any slight deviations
of the 0 ppm offset to be incorporated into the model and corrected
for.

Monte Carlo Error Simulations
As each liver started
with a different glycogen level, the calculation of error estimates
with repeated measures was not feasible. As an alternative, we used
Monte Carlo simulations based on the SNR of the 13C and 1H spectra to generate standard deviations for each 13C NMR and CEST measurement, respectively. For the 13C
NMR errors, a normal distribution with a mean of zero and standard
deviation equal to the root-mean-square (RMS) noise of the 13C NMR spectrum was created, and random values from this distribution
were added to each resonance integral value. The total sum of the
areas of the glycogen NMR peaks was then recalculated, and this procedure
was repeated 50 000 times to generate a distribution of 13C NMR signal areas. The standard deviation of this distribution
was used as the horizontal error bar in the plot of 13C
NMR determined glycogen versus CEST MTRasym AUC. For the
CEST errors, a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard
deviation equal to the RMS noise of the 1H NMR spectra
in the Z-spectrum was created and random values from this distribution
were added to each resonance in the Z-spectrum. The integral of each
resonance in the new Z-spectrum was then recalculated, and this new
Z-spectrum was fit with an inverted Lorentzian model, from which the
MTRasym AUC could be recalculated as described in the Data Analysis section above. This process was
repeated 50 000 times to generate a distribution of MTRasym AUC values, and the standard deviation of this distribution
was used as the vertical error bar in the plot of 13C NMR
determined glycogen versus CEST MTRasym AUC.

The
correlation between 13C NMR determined glycogen and CEST
MTRasym AUC was then investigated by randomly choosing
pairs of 13C NMR determined glycogen values and CEST MTRasym AUC values from each distribution for all perfused liver
studies, performing a linear regression, and repeating for all 50 000
values in the respective distributions. In this way, distributions
for the R2, slope, and Y-intercept values characterizing this correlation could be formed
and the standard deviation of each was used as an estimate of the
error in each of these parameters. This error simulation protocol
is shown schematically in Figure 3.

the simulation protocol used to generate estimates
of the inherent errors in the 13C NMR and CEST measurements
of perfused liver glycogen and also in the correlation between the
two measurement methods.

Results and Discussion
Phantom Studies
We first used simple
liver tissue-mimicking
phantoms to optimize the performance of CEST over the expected physiological
range of liver glycogen levels. Figure 4a shows
sample Z-spectra (B1 = 4 μT, 0.5
s) and MTRasym curves for total phantom glycogen amounts
of 0, 200, 400, and 800 μmoles of glucose equivalents. Figure 4b shows a plot of total phantom glycogen versus
CEST MTRasym total AUC for a B1 = 4 μT saturation pulse with saturation times of 0.25, 0.5,
1, and 2 s. The 0.5 s pulse was defined as optimal based on the observation
that it yielded the maximum dynamic range while maintaining a high
degree of linearity (R2 = 0.96). Studies
with lower B1 values and/or longer saturation
times were also performed but, as expected from other reports, resulted
in either a reduced dynamic range or a nonlinear relationship. As
described in Methods, these phantom studies
were performed only to determine the optimal saturation pulse parameters
for glycogen and were not used to calibrate the glycogen CEST signal
due to expected differences in structural and relaxation characteristics
compared to glycogen in tissue.

Figure 4 Data from phantom studies showing (a)
a sample set of Z-spectra
(closed plot symbols) and MTRasym curves (open plot symbols)
for increasing total glycogen amounts for B1 = 4 μT, 0.5 s, and (b) the relationship between total glycogen
and MTRasym AUC (mean ± SEM, n =
2) for increasing saturation pulse lengths with B1 = 4 μT.

Our RF-pulse parameters and MTRasym values were
similar
to those reported in many other biomolecule CEST studies. We also
separately studied the CEST MR signal from glucose in similarly prepared
phantoms (data not shown) and found that the CEST signal was approximately
2-fold greater, consistent with the fact that free glucose has 5 exchangeable
−OH groups, while the glucosyl units in glycogen have 2–3
exchangeable −OH groups depending on branching within the glycogen
molecule.

Perfused Liver Studies
We then performed perfused liver
studies using lean C57/Bl6 mice, which were fasted, fed normal chow,
or fed a high fructose diet to generate a range of liver glycogen
levels. Studies were performed using interleaved natural abundance 13C NMR and CEST acquisitions as shown in the protocol in Figure 2. After initial 13C NMR and CEST acquisitions,
a 100 pM dose of glucagon was added to the perfusion system. Figure 5a,b shows raw 13C NMR and CEST data,
respectively, acquired in a selected perfused liver experiment. Here,
we can see that the 100 pM dose of glucagon stimulated glycogenolysis
and served to generate a range of liver glycogen values in a single
study. However, since glucagon will also cause glucose release from
the liver and since glucose −OH protons have also been shown
to have a CEST signal,11,17 there was likely to be additional
CEST signal following glucagon administration. To account for this,
data from all the perfused liver studies were separated into two groups,
those acquired before glucagon addition and those acquired after glucagon
addition.

Figure 5 Raw 13C NMR (a) and CEST data with MTRasym inset (b) from a sample perfused liver study for T = baseline (blue), 60 min postglucagon (red), and 120 min postglucagon
(black).

We also investigated which region
of the MTRasym curve
would be optimal to use for correlation with the 13C NMR
data by comparing the R2 value for the
correlation between 13C NMR determined glycogen and CEST
MTRasym AUC as different regions of the MTRasym curve were incorporated into the AUC calculation. Figure 6 shows the dependence of this R2 value on which region of the MTRasym curve
was integrated (for fixed integration range of +2 ppm). Here, we see
that the region that produced the maximum R2 value is 0.5–2.5 ppm which is consistent with the glycogen
−OHs being reported to resonate at approximately 1.2 ppm downfield
from water.11

Figure 6 R2 value for the 13C NMR–CEST
correlation as a function of which region of the MTRasym curve was used for integration. The x-axis represents
the beginning of the integration region, and a 2 ppm interval was
used. Note that the maximum R2 value occurs
at approximately 0.5 ppm (arrow) suggesting that the optimal range
of the MTRasym curve to use for integration is 0.5–2.5
ppm. Data shown is for the group of measurements made after glucagon
was administered to the perfused livers; however, the data from the
preglucagon measurement is similar.

Figure 7 shows a plot of 13C
NMR determined glycogen versus CEST MTRasym AUC0.5–2.5 for data acquired before (blue) and after (red) glucagon. The R2 values were 0.88 ± 0.054 and 0.87 ±
0.040; the slope values were 0.0091 ± 0.00078 and 0.0082 ±
0.00064, and the Y-intercept values were −0.50
± 0.38 and 2.4 ± 0.21, respectively (mean ± SD). Error
bars for the data points in Figure 7 as well
as for the standard deviations for the correlation parameters were
determined by Monte Carlo simulations (see Methods). We observed a strong linear relationship between 13C NMR determined glycogen and CEST MTRasym AUC0.5–2.5 both before and after glucagon treatment. The slope of the relationship
was similar in both groups as evidenced by the overlapping standard
deviations. This slope value can be used in future studies as a calibration
factor between CEST MTRasym AUC0.5–2.5 and total perfused liver glycogen. The fact that the Y-intercept is within two standard deviations of zero (i.e., not statistically
different from zero) in the data obtained before glucagon addition
demonstrates that there are few competing endogenous CEST metabolites
in this spectral region of the liver. The increased Y-intercept value observed after glucagon addition is attributed to
glucose release from the liver adding an additional CEST signal during
this period of the experiment.

Figure 7 Correlation of CEST vs 13C
NMR determined total glycogen
in perfused livers under baseline conditions (blue) and following
glucagon addition (red). Note that the slopes in the two plots appear
to be similar while the Y-intercept is higher in
the red group due to the release of glucose stimulated by glucagon.

Interestingly, this glucose CEST
signal is much higher than would
have been predicted on the basis of the expected perfusate glucose
concentration of approximately 1 mM in the NMR tube (determined by
the perfusion flow rate and observed glycogen breakdown rate) and
differences in numbers of exchangeable −OH groups between glucose
and glycogen. We noted that, while the linear relationship between
total glycogen and CEST MTRasym that was observed in phantoms
was preserved in the perfused liver studies, the overall magnitude
of the MTRasym signal was reduced approximately by a factor
of 4 in the perfused liver studies. Factors which could account for
this are the lower water relaxation (T1w) values in liver compared to the phantom solutions, differences
in the molecular architecture of glycogen (e.g., branching patterns,
number of tiers) in liver compared to that in phantom solutions (oyster
glycogen), and also the protein-bound nature of glycogen in tissue.24 The latter could reduce the CEST effect either
directly by removing exchangeable glycogen −OH groups or by
altering the relaxation properties of the glycogen −OH groups.
This observation of reduced glycogen CEST signal in liver has two
significant implications in the design of in vivo studies using CEST-based
measurements of tissue glycogen. First, glycogen phantom solutions
cannot be used to calibrate in vivo tissue glycogen measurements as
is often done with the NMR detection of other metabolites/biomolecules.
Second, the competing CEST signal from glucose represents a much larger
potential hurdle than originally anticipated in the translation of
this measurement to an in vivo setting (where glucose is always present
in the liver). For example, a typical range of values for liver glycogen
is 100–400 mM, while circulating glucose is generally near
5 mM. However, the 4-fold reduction of glycogen signal in liver we
observed combined with the approximate 2-fold reduction in exchangeable
protons in glycogen suggests that, in vivo, the glucose CEST signal
can range from 10% to 40% of the glycogen CEST signal. As such, care
must be taken to maintain glucose as constant as possible throughout
an in vivo study to allow for specific detection of changes in the
glycogen CEST signal. This implies that the use of CEST to measure
absolute changes in liver glycogen in vivo would likely perform optimally
with a glucose clamp protocol. It should be noted, however, that these
studies were performed at 11.7 T which is much higher than most clinical
MRI scanners. As such, it is possible that, at lower fields where
relaxation times are generally shorter, the amount of competing glucose
CEST signal may be different.

Relative Precision of CEST
The error bars for the plot
shown in Figure 7, along with the errors reported
for the R2, slope, and Y-intercept values, were determined by Monte Carlo simulations (see Methods) based on the respective SNR of the 13C NMR glycogen spectra and 1H NMR Z-spectra. These
error values allow us to estimate and compare the relative precision
inherent to each approach. Defining the relative precision as the
ratio of the dynamic range to the average error for each technique,
we estimate values of 10:1 and 80:1 for 13C NMR and CEST
MTRasym AUC, respectively, implying that CEST is inherently
∼8-fold more precise than natural abundance 13C
NMR. It is important to realize, however, that this calculation is
based solely on the SNR of the original 1H and 13C spectra, and it is likely that other experimental factors such
as variations in shimming quality and variations in B1 pulse
power from experiment to experiment could reduce the precision of
the CEST measurement. As a preliminary assessment of this, we studied
a 40 mM glycogen phantom (prepared as described in Methods) and measured the CEST MTRasym under the
following three conditions: (1) optimal shimming (1H line
width = 40 Hz) with B1 = 4 μT, (2)
suboptimal shimming (1H line width = 50 Hz) with B1 = 4 μT, and (3) optimal shimming with B1 = 3.6 μT (i.e., a 10% error in the B1 pulse). We found that case (2) produced an
error in the CEST MTRasym of ∼5% while case (3)
produced an error of ∼10%. Both of these errors are larger
than the SNR-based errors estimated by the Monte Carlo simulations
(∼1–2%), demonstrating that variations in experimental
parameters are likely to be the dominant source of error in CEST measurements
of liver glycogen. In contrast, we routinely observe that errors in 13C NMR measurements of glycogen are relatively insensitive
to small variations in shimming and other experimental parameters
and are dominated mostly by the inherently low SNR of the 13C nucleus.

Conclusion
In summary, we have implemented
and optimized an experimental protocol
in which 1H CEST NMR was used to accurately and noninvasively
measure liver glycogen over the normal physiological range in perfused
livers. The CEST data were calibrated by reference to 13C NMR spectroscopic data and under appropriate experimental conditions
varied in direct proportion to the 13C NMR measurement.
Using Monte Carlo simulations, we found that inherent errors in glycogen
CEST measurements were small and likely to be less important than
errors caused by variations in experimental conditions. We found that
the CEST signal from glycogen in liver was significantly less than
that observed from identical amounts in solution. As a consequence
of this, we assert that (1) phantom solutions cannot be used to calibrate
in vivo or whole tissue glycogen measurements and (2) free glucose,
despite its lower physiological concentration, could still significantly
interfere with glycogen CEST measurements.

Our findings open
the door for accurate and reliable measurements
of tissue glycogen in vivo, assuming that suitable experimental protocols
are chosen to keep circulating glucose levels constant. The validated
CEST method offers the advantage of using conventional proton MRI
scanners and proton detection, which is widely available. Therefore,
CEST-based sensing has a strong potential for future clinical translation,
which can be used as a tool to noninvasively report glycogen levels.
Furthermore, unlike 13C detection inherently limited by
low SNR, CEST-based imaging methods already demonstrated in vivo could
additionally report on the distribution and heterogeneity of in vivo
glycogen.
