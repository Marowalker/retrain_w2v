Metabolite
identifications are most frequently achieved in untargeted
metabolomics by matching precursor mass and full, high-resolution
MS2 spectra to metabolite databases and standards. Here
we considered an alternative approach for establishing metabolite
identifications that does not rely on full, high-resolution MS2 spectra. First, we select mass-to-charge regions containing
the most informative metabolite fragments and designate them as bins.
We then translate each metabolite fragmentation pattern into a binary
code by assigning 1’s to bins containing fragments and 0’s
to bins without fragments. With 20 bins, this binary-code system is
capable of distinguishing 96% of the compounds in the METLIN MS2 library. A major advantage of the approach is that it extends
untargeted metabolomics to low-resolution triple quadrupole (QqQ)
instruments, which are typically less expensive and more robust than
other types of mass spectrometers. We demonstrate a method of acquiring
MS2 data in which the third quadrupole of a QqQ instrument
cycles over 20 wide isolation windows (coinciding with the location
and width of our bins) for each precursor mass selected by the first
quadrupole. Operating the QqQ instrument in this mode yields diagnostic
bar codes for each precursor mass that can be matched to the bar codes
of metabolite standards. Furthermore, our data suggest that using
low-resolution bar codes enables QqQ instruments to make MS2-based identifications in untargeted metabolomics with a specificity
and sensitivity that is competitive to high-resolution time-of-flight
technologies.

==== Body
Although
profiling features
from biological samples by untargeted metabolomics is now routine,
establishing the chemical identities of those features remains a major
challenge.1−4 Even when using state-of-the-art liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry
(LC/MS) technologies and automated bioinformatic pipelines, analysis
of untargeted metabolomic data sets is time-consuming and only a fraction
of the thousands of features detected are identified.5−7 In this sense, untargeted metabolomics as conventionally performed
with LC/MS is highly inefficient.

Historically, to support the
structural identification of a feature
in untargeted metabolomics, high-resolution MS2 data from
in-house standards have been matched to high-resolution MS2 data from research samples.8 However,
this process is severely limited by the availability of in-house standards
in most laboratories. Thus, to help with metabolite identifications,
fragmentation data from a variety of instrument platforms have become
increasingly available online in recent years.9−12 METLIN, which is currently the
largest public MS2 database for metabolomics, has experimental
high-resolution MS2 data for over 14 000 metabolites.13 Yet, despite the availability of these MS2 data, efficient identification of large numbers of features
in untargeted metabolomic experiments continues to be experimentally
challenging.7

In contrast to untargeted
metabolomics, solutions for targeted
metabolomics are well established.14 Most
frequently, targeted experiments are performed with a triple quadrupole
(QqQ) mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode.15 After empirically identifying precursor-to-product
transitions for the metabolites of interest, MRM methods can be optimized
to rapidly and efficiently profile those compounds. The resulting
data are relatively easy to interpret compared to data from untargeted
metabolomic experiments. In addition to their proven sensitivity,
quantitative reliability, and robustness, QqQ instruments are also
generally less expensive than the high-resolution mass spectrometers
that are conventionally used for untargeted metabolomics.16,17 Indeed, QqQ-based methods have become the gold standard in the pharmaceutical
industry.18 The main limitation of the
MRM-based workflow is that it provides narrow (i.e., targeted) coverage
of the metabolome.

In this study, we evaluate a novel approach
for performing untargeted
metabolomics that achieves broad coverage while leveraging the experimental
efficiency of a targeted workflow. The basis of our work is a strategy
for translating high-resolution MS2 spectra into low-resolution
bar codes without sacrificing the diagnostic specificity of the fragmentation
patterns (Figure 1 and Figure 2).19 The efficiency of the bar codes enables low-resolution,
QqQ-based metabolomic workflows that have a specificity and sensitivity
competitive to that of high-resolution time-of-flight (TOF) instruments.

Experimental Section
Validating Standard Fragmentation
Data
Two solutions
containing separate standards were prepared in 1:1 acetonitrile (ACN)/water
(H2O) at a concentration of 0.5 mM, enabling independent
analysis of isomers without chromatographic separation. The first
solution contained sucrose, citrate, tryptophan, and palmitate, while
the second contained maltose, isocitrate, and aspartate.

To
verify the high-resolution fragmentation data in METLIN for these
metabolites, the standard solutions were directly injected at 50 μL/min
into an Agilent 6540 UHD QTOF operating in ESI(−) mode. Targeted
MS2 data were collected at collision energies of 0, 10,
20, and 40 V. MS source conditions were as described previously.1 The fragmentor was set to 100 V, MS acquisition
range was from 25 to 1700 m/z, and
acquisition rate was set to 1 spectrum/s.

QqQ Analysis in Bar-Coding
Mode
Fragmentation data
for the standards were then reacquired, this time by aggregating fragment
intensities for 20 selected m/z bins
(Table 1). The standard
solutions were directly injected at 50 μL/min into an Agilent
6460 QqQ operating in precursor ion scanning mode, with the first
quadrupole scanning from 100 to 400 m/z range in 0.1 Da steps and the third quadrupole cycling between the
selected m/z bins at each precursor
mass. For analysis of zebrafish extracts, an aminopropyl HILIC separation
was used as previously described.20 Bin
collision energies were converted from the QTOF collision energies
shown in Table 1 to
equivalent collision energies for our QqQ 6460, which we estimated
based on empirical evidence to be ∼7/10 of QTOF voltages. QqQ
source settings were identical to those of the QTOF. However, because
the third quadrupole’s isolation window was set to match the
width of our selected m/z bins,
it had to be manually tuned. Tuning was accomplished in MS2 scan mode by adjusting gain and offset settings for the third quadrupole
so that the fwhm of the 113.0 m/z tuning calibrant peak matched our desired bin size for that mass
(which was a width of 6.2). The following optimized settings for MS2 unit-width isolation were then used in precursor ion scanning
mode for data collection: width gain, 48; width offset, 2; axis gain,
41; axis offset, 1.5.

Sensitivity
Measurements
To determine the sensitivity
performance of bar coding, we compared the limits of detection (LODs)
for every fragment of each standard compound as measured by three
different MS2 data acquisition methods. First, each standard
solution was prepared at a range of concentrations (0.016, 0.033,
0.065, 0.13, 0.36, 0.52, 1.6, 3.1, 6.3, 13, 25, 50, 100, 200, and
400 μM). Next, each solution was injected directly into the
instrument for analysis by TOF, bar-coding, and quadrupole MS2-scan analysis, with a dwell time of 2 s/compound in each
analysis mode. For the TOF measurements, the Agilent 6540 UHD QTOF
was used in targeted MS2 mode, with a 1 Da MS1 isolation window, at collision energies of 20 and 40 V. Other QTOF
settings were identical to those used above. For bar coding, the Agilent
6460 was used as described above, but with Q1 isolating each standard
compound’s precursor mass for 2 s instead of scanning. For
the MS2-scan measurement, the QqQ was returned to normal
MS2 unit-width isolation settings (width gain, −19.6;
width offset, dynamic; axis gain, 3.4; axis offset, dynamic) and then
operated in MS2-scan mode at each standard’s precursor
mass, scanning from 25 to 425 m/z values with 0.1 Da steps in 2 s, at collision energies of 14 and
28 V. Finally, each fragment’s LOD under the different acquisition
methods was normalized to its parent compound’s LOD as measured
by two MRMs targeting only its two most abundant fragments, once again
with a dwell time of 2 s/compound. All LODs were defined as the concentration
at which the signal-to-noise ratio for a given fragment becomes greater
than 2.5, with noise level determined by the intensity signal from
a 1:1 ACN/H2O blank run in parallel.

Results and Discussion
The current standard for supporting metabolite identifications
in untargeted metabolomics is matching full, high-resolution MS2 spectra from research samples to full, high-resolution MS2 spectra of authentic model compounds.8 Even with the newest instrumentation platforms and advanced informatic
technologies, the process is tedious and inefficient. Here we considered
an alternative strategy in which we converted the full, high-resolution
MS2 spectra of authentic model compounds into codes. As
we discuss below, these MS2 codes have high diagnostic
specificity for supporting metabolite identifications. Yet, importantly,
experimentally measuring a metabolite’s code does not require
full, high-resolution MS2 spectra. Rather, codes can be
effectively measured with low-resolution QqQ instruments.

In
this study we consider two representations of binned high-resolution
MS2 spectra, which we refer to as spectral codes and bar
codes (Figure 1 and Figure 2). To convert a high-resolution
MS2 spectrum into a spectral code, we sum the abundance
of fragments in discrete m/z windows.
We call each m/z window a bin. The
width and location of our selected bins is defined in Table 1. The result is a spectrum where m/z-intensity pairs are replaced by bin-intensity
pairs. A simplified representation of a spectral code is a bar code,
in which only the presence or absence of fragments in a bin is considered.

When a metabolite produces fragments within a m/z window, we assign a “1” to that
bin. When a metabolite does not produce a fragment in a m/z window, we assign a “0” to that
bin. To decide if a fragment is present or absent, we first sum the
intensities of all fragments in a metabolite’s high-resolution
MS2 spectrum. Bins containing intensities less than 1%
of the total signal are then designated as 0. The result of the approach
is a string of 1’s and 0’s, or a bar code, for each
metabolite. A schematic of the approach is shown in Figure 1. In this study, we exclusively
focus on bar-coded MS2 data, but spectral codes could be
employed in an analogous matter.

An important step in bar coding
MS2 spectra is identifying
informative bins with high diagnostic specificity. Previously, we
determined the most unique precursor-to-product transitions that could
be used to construct the fewest number of MRMs for profiling all metabolites
in METLIN.21 We used these informative
fragments as the basis for selecting bins. In brief, we optimized
the combination of bins that enabled us to resolve as many compounds
with MS2 spectra in METLIN as possible within 0.1 Da. We
also considered experimental restrictions related to the tuning and
capability of our instrument’s quadrupoles. We found that bar
codes from 20 bins were theoretically adequate to distinguish 96%
of the compounds in the METLIN MS2 library (Table 1). We note that future optimization
of our approach may consider precursor-dependent bin selection or
context-dependent selection of precursor masses. Sensitivity could
also be improved by gaining programmatic access to the tuning of our
instrument to increase the flexibility and transmission efficiency
of the third quadrupole’s isolation window.

Next, we
considered how we could efficiently profile metabolites
by using bar codes. We used a QqQ instrument to perform a new mode
of data acquisition in which we cycled through 20 wide isolation windows
with Q3 (corresponding to our bins) for every precursor mass selected
by Q1. We refer to this method of operating a QqQ instrument as “bar-coding
mode”. When we scan all precursor masses with Q1, we obtain
a comprehensive list of bar codes for each sample (Figure 2). We point out that using
a QqQ instrument in bar-coding mode is different than using a QqQ
instrument in the traditional precursor ion scanning mode or MRM mode
where the goal is to use Q3 to isolate a specific fragment with a
unique mass value. By using multiple large windows that coincide with
our bins, we substantially improve experimental efficiency and coverage
with only a minor compromise in specificity. Additionally, the data
output consists of a binned spectrum that can be transformed into
a string of 1’s and 0’s for each precursor mass and
matched to the bar codes of standard compounds.

To demonstrate
the approach, we analyzed a set of standard compounds
with a QqQ operating in bar-coding mode. The standards we analyzed
included two sets of structural isomers, citrate/isocitrate and maltose/sucrose,
which were selected to highlight that bar codes can distinguish between
noncoeluting metabolites with the same precursor mass. The raw data
for citrate and isocitrate are shown in Figure 2. As above, the intensity of the signal in
each bin was integrated and compared to the total. Bins with intensities
less than 1% of the total were assigned 0’s, while all other
bins were assigned 1’s. The experimental bar codes we generated
matched the theoretical bar codes we calculated by using high-resolution
METLIN data (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Predicted and experimental bar codes for several metabolites. Theoretical
bar codes were determined on the basis of MS2 data in METLIN.
Experimental data were acquired with a QqQ instrument and then translated
into 1’s and 0’s.

It is important to emphasize that the 20 bins we have used
here
are optimized for the analysis of biochemically complex samples. Indeed,
we were able to identify the same 7 metabolites in a zebrafish extract
by using a QqQ in bar-coding mode. This result demonstrates the applicability
of bar coding to complex biological samples.

Having established
the specificity of our bar-coding approach,
we next considered its sensitivity relative to other methods of obtaining
MS2 data. For the same set of standards used above, we
measured the limit of detection for each fragment with bar-coding,
QqQ-based MS2 scanning, and TOF experiments. We used a
QTOF in targeted MS2 mode to generate precursor isolation
and fragmentation for the TOF experiment comparable to that of the
QqQ experiments. We then normalized these data to the limit of detection
measured for each compound by monitoring its two most abundant fragments
with MRM experiments. All experiments performed were allotted the
same dwell time per compound. Strikingly, we found that measuring
fragmentation patterns with 20 bar codes has a sensitivity comparable
to that of measuring fragmentation patterns with a TOF (Figure 4). As expected, the sensitivity
of QqQ-based MS2 scanning was 2 orders of magnitude worse.
Interestingly, bar-code experiments were more sensitive than predicted
based on the duty-cycle considerations of MRM and TOF type experiments.
We considered the duty cycle of a MRM experiment as one over the number
of transitions (1/20 or 5%) and the duty cycle of a TOF as 10–20%
due to ion loss during pulsing.22 We rationalize
these results based on the enhanced transmission efficiency of larger
quadrupole isolation windows and the increased signal that results
from multiple ion fragments contributing to the same bin.1

Figure 4 Relative sensitivity of different MS2 acquisition
methods.
Our analysis is based on a comparison of the limits of detection for
each fragment of our standards (see text for details). We normalized
to the limit of detection measured by MRM experiments in which the
two most abundant fragment intensities were monitored for each compound.
The data shown here represent the average of each experiment.

We have shown here that bar coding
provides a combination of specificity,
sensitivity, and compound coverage for metabolomics that is competitive
to other methods of MS2 data acquisition. We imagine that
bar coding could be integrated into metabolomic workflows in several
ways. We outline two possibilities below.

One possible approach
for generating a large number of metabolite
identifications is a QqQ-based workflow in which the instrument scans
the full range of potential metabolite precursor masses in bar-coding
mode. When using the 20 bins calculated in Table 1, this approach will theoretically enable
the identification of 96% of the compounds in the METLIN MS2 database from complex biological samples (assuming, as with any
MS2-based identification method, that chromatography is
used to prevent compounds with the same mass from coeluting). As we
have demonstrated, LC coupled bar coding enabled us to identify a
select group of metabolites in zebrafish extract. However, a practical
consideration is the trade-off between sensitivity and the number
of precursor masses selected. Scanning over the entire range of possible
metabolite precursor masses with Q1 results in a low duty cycle and
will be particularly problematic for low-abundance metabolites. Therefore,
we imagine a workflow in which the precursor mass space is divided
into smaller ranges and analyzed over multiple LC/MS sample runs.
As an alternative solution, precursor mass space could be constrained
on the basis of a prescan in which Q1 operates in rf-only mode and
a summed code is detected. This prescan provides information about
the possible precursors that generated the summed code and thus limits
the number of potential precursor masses present.

A second possible
application of bar coding could be for targeted
studies in place of MRM experiments. In this application, Q1 only
selects precursor masses of interest while Q3 operates in bar-coding
mode. An advantage of this approach is that it enables analytical
specificity and sensitivity to be accomplished on a QqQ instrument
without the labor-intensive development of MRM methods.

Conclusions
By considering the presence or absence of fragments in 20 discrete m/z bins, we have transformed high-resolution
MS2 spectra into bar codes of 1’s and 0’s
that can be measured with low-resolution QqQ instruments. Notably,
this informatic compression does not substantially reduce specificity
with respect to metabolite identification when we select bins that
contain the most informative MS2 fragments (Table 1). Additionally, we have shown
that QqQ instruments operating in bar-coding mode can acquire MS2 spectra with a sensitivity comparable to that of TOF instruments.
Therefore, we believe that the application of bar codes is a promising
and unexplored avenue for untargeted metabolomics.
