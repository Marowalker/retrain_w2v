Flavin
adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is involved in important metabolic
reactions where the biological function is intrinsically related to
changes in conformation. In the present work, FAD conformational changes
were studied in solution and in gas phase by measuring the fluorescence
decay time and ion-neutral collision cross sections (CCS, in a trapped
ion mobility spectrometer, TIMS) as a function of the solvent conditions
(i.e., organic content) and gas-phase collisional partner (i.e., N2 doped with organic molecules). Changes in the fluorescence
decay suggest that FAD can exist in four conformations in solution,
where the abundance of the extended conformations increases with the
organic content. TIMS-MS experiments showed that FAD can exist in
the gas phase as deprotonated (M = C27H31N9O15P2) and protonated forms (M = C27H33N9O15P2) and
that multiple conformations (up to 12) can be observed as a function
of the starting solution for the [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+molecular ions. In addition, changes in the relative abundances
of the gas-phase structures were observed from a “stack”
to a “close” conformation when organic molecules were
introduced in the TIMS cell as collision partners. Candidate structures
optimized at the DFT/B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) were proposed for each IMS band,
and results showed that the most abundant IMS band corresponds to
the most stable candidate structure. Solution and gas-phase experiments
suggest that the driving force that stabilizes the different conformations
is based on the interaction of the adenine and isoalloxazine rings
that can be tailored by the “solvation” effect created
with the organic molecules.

==== Body
Flavin adenine
dinucleotide
(FAD) is involved in multiple metabolic reactions. Its primary role
is being a cofactor necessary for the activity of numerous flavoproteins,
which play an important role in electron transport pathways in living
systems like respiration,1 photosynthesis,2,3 DNA repair,4,5 and photoreceptors and nitrogen
fixation.6 Since Weber7 reported a weakness in the fluorescence of FAD in comparison
with the fluorescence of free riboflavin, a number of studies has
proposed the existence of at least two conformers for FAD in solution.8,9 One “stack” conformer exhibits a quenching of fluorescence,
which presents a π–π interaction between aromatic
rings and intramolecular hydrogen bonds that stabilizes the adenine
moiety and isoalloxazine ring,10,11 which might contribute
to 80% of the molecules of FAD in solution.12 Additionally, an “open” conformer does not present
quenching of the fluorescence.7,13 Even though the existence
of an “open” and a “stack” conformation
is generally accepted, little is known about the structural details
and the conformational space of FAD. Studies on free riboflavin and
the adenosine derivative 5′-bromo-5′-deoxyadenosine
using crystallographic methods have shown an average structure of
the π–π systems.14 Different
models for the interaction between the flavin and adenine moieties
have been proposed on the basis of NMR studies.11,15−18 However, all NMR studies presented the complication of intermolecular
stacking between the flavin complexes at millimolar concentrations.

During the last decades, ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) combined
with molecular dynamic simulations has proven to be a versatile technique
for the analysis of intermediate and equilibrium structures of biomolecules
enabling the correlation of ion-neutral, collision cross sections
(CCS) with candidate structures.19−24 In particular, it has been shown that using soft ionization techniques
(e.g., electrospray ionization, ESI25)
the evaporative cooling of the solvent leads to a freezing of multiple
conformations, which has permitted the study of the conformational
space dependence on the solvent conditions (e.g., native vs denatured),
bath gas collision partner, and temperature.26−37 With the recent introduction of trapped ion mobility spectrometry
coupled to mass spectrometry (TIMS-MS),38,39 we have shown
that high mobility separations (R = 100–250)
can be routinely achieved.40 In particular,
we have shown that the study of biomolecules traditionally named “unstructured”
by NMR and XRD is feasible due to the ability to measure multiple
conformations at a given time and to perform kinetic studies of conformational
interconversion as a way to elucidate folding/unfolding pathways.41,42

In the present work, the conformational space of FAD in solution
phase and in gas phase as a function of the solution composition was
studied using a combination of TIMS-MS, fluorescence time decay, and
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We present evidence that FAD
[M + H]+ and [M + Na]+ molecular ions observed
during ESI can be deprotonated and protonated, which leads to multiple
stable conformations (totaling 12 IMS bands) whose relative abundance
can be tailored by the solvent conditions and the gas-phase collision
partner. Special attention was given to the interrelation between
the MD and IMS data, and candidate structures for each IMS band are
proposed.

Methods
Materials and Reagents
Flavin adenine
dinucleotide
disodium salt hydrate (F6625) powder was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO) and used as received. All solvents and ammonium acetate
salts used in these studies were analytical grade or better and purchased
from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). A stock solution was prepared
in 10 mM ammonium acetate, and aliquots were diluted to a final concentration
of 1, 5, and 10 μM in 70:30, 50:50, and 30:70 (v/v) water–methanol/ethanol
solutions. A Tuning Mix calibration standard (TuneMix, G24221A) was
purchased from Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA) and used as
received. Details on the Tunemix structures (e.g., m/z = 322, K0 = 1.376
cm2 V–1 s–1 and m/z = 622, K0 = 1.013 cm2 V–1 s–1) can be found elsewhere.40,43 All experiments were
performed in triplicates.

Trapped Ion Mobility Spectrometry–Mass
Spectrometry Separation
Details regarding the TIMS operation
and specifics compared to
traditional IMS can be found elsewhere.38−42 Briefly, in TIMS mobility, separation is based on
holding the ions stationary using an electric field against a moving
gas. The separation in a TIMS device can be described by the center
of the mass frame using the same principles as in a conventional IMS
drift tube.44 Since mobility separation
is related to the number of ion-neutral collisions (or drift time
in traditional drift tube cells), the mobility separation in a TIMS
device depends on the bath gas drift velocity, ion confinement, and
ion elution parameters. The reduced mobility, K0, of an ion in a TIMS cell is described by 1  where vg, E, Velution, and Vbase are the velocity of the gas, applied electric
field,
elution and base voltages, respectively. The constant A can be determined using calibration standards of known reduced mobilities.
In TIMS operation, multiple geometric isomers/conformers are trapped
simultaneously at different E values resulting from
a voltage gradient applied across the TIMS tunnel. After thermalization,
geometrical isomers/conformers are eluted by decreasing the electric
field in stepwise decrements (referred to as the “ramp”).
Each isomer/conformer eluting from the TIMS cell can be described
by a characteristic voltage (i.e., Velution – Vbase). Eluted ions are then
mass analyzed and detected by a maXis impact Q-ToF mass spectrometer
(Bruker Daltonics Inc., Billerica, MA).

In a TIMS device, the
total analysis time can be described as 2  where Ttrap is
the thermalization/trapping time, ToF is the time after the mobility
separation, and Vramp and Tramp are the voltage range and time required to vary the
electric field, respectively. The elution voltage can be experimentally
determined by varying the ramp time for a constant ramp voltage. This
procedure also determines the time ions spend outside the separation
region To (e.g., ion trapping and time-of-flight).

The TIMS funnel is controlled using in-house software, written
in National Instruments Lab VIEW, and synchronized with the maXis
Impact Q-ToF acquisition program.38,39 TIMS separation
was performed using nitrogen as a bath gas at ca. 300 K, and the gas
flow velocity was controlled by the pressure difference between entrance
funnel P1 = 2.6 mbar and the exit funnel P2 = 1.0 mbar. P1 and P2 values were held constant for
all experiments. Dopant additives were introduced at the entrance
of the tunnel region of the TIMS analyzer and monitored with an external
capacitance gauge from MKS instruments (Andover, MA). Methanol, ethanol,
and acetone were used as dopant additives and introduced through a
1 mm i.d. aperture at 10 mbar. The same RF (880 kHz and 200Vpp) was
applied to all electrodes including the entrance funnel, the mobility
separating section, and the exit funnel. An electrospray ionization
source (ESI Apollo II design, Bruker Daltonics, Inc., MA) was used
for all the analyses. The TIMS cell was operated using a fill/trap/ramp/wait
sequence of 10/10/50–500/50 ms. Average mobility resolution
at 10/10/500/50 was 160–190.

Reduced mobility values
(K0) were correlated
with CCS (Ω) using the equation: 3  where z is the charge of
the ion, kB is the Boltzmann constant, N* is the number density, and mI and mb refer to the masses of the ion
and bath gas, respectively.44

Fluorescence
Decay Analysis
Fluorescence decay experiments
were performed on FAD as a function of the solvent conditions using
a ChronosFD spectrofluorometer (ISS, Champaign, IL) in the frequency
domain mode. A 10 μM FAD solution was excited using a 470 nm
laser diode, and fluorescent emission was collected using 500 and
650 nm long and short pass filters, respectively (Andover, Salem,
NH). A rhodamine B water solution was used for lifetime calibration
(τ =1.7 ns).45 Polarizers were set
at magic angle configuration. The fluorescence decay lifetimes were
recovered by a nonlinear fit of the data using a triple exponential
decay using GlobalWe software (Laboratory of Fluorescence Dynamics,
Irvine, CA).

Theoretical Calculations
A pool
of candidate structures
were proposed for each molecular ion observed in the TIMS-MS experiments.
The initial pool of candidate structures was obtained using serial
molecular dynamics simulations of annealing and geometry optimization
cycles in a NVT thermostat (equivalent to the approach described in
ref (31)) using AMBER03
force field in YASARA software. In particular, the NVT thermostat
was set to recreate the TIMS cell experiment; the simulation box contained
the molecular ion of interest with bath and dopant gas molecules.
Final structures were optimized at the DFT/B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level
using Gaussian software.46 Vibrational
frequencies were calculated to guarantee that the optimized structures
correspond to a real minima in the energy space, and zero-point energy
corrections were applied to calculate the relative stability between
the structures for each FAD form (i.e., [M + H]+ and [M
+ Na]+, M = C27H33N9O15P2 and [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+, M = C27H31N9O15P2). During the IMS experimental conditions (i.e., 300 K), the
structures may interconvert and transitions states (and energy barriers)
were not calculated in the present work. However, the observation
of multiple IMS bands suggests that multiple local minima exist which
translates into the existence of multiple conformations. Theoretical
ion-neutral collision cross sections were calculated using MOBCAL
version for helium47,48 and nitrogen,49,50 as a bath gas at ca. 300 K. It should be noted that the MOBCAL version
for nitrogen was used assuming the similarity of the molecules to
those used to develop the Lennard-Jones potential at 300 K in refs (49 and 50); for other molecules, alternatives
methods are encouraged.51 Partial atomic
charges were calculated using the Merz–Singh–Kollman
scheme constrained to the molecular dipole moment.52,53 All optimized geometries and partial atomic charges used in the
MOBCAL input files are provided in the Supporting
Information.

Results and Discussion
The MS analysis
of FAD shows that four molecular ions are produced
by the ESI source, independent of the water–organic content
ratio (Figure 1). The most abundant [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+ molecular ions correspond to the
protonated form of FAD (M = C27H33N9O15P2), while similar molecular ions were observed
for the deprotonated form (M = C27H31N9O15P2). This result is consistent with previously
reported MS experiments (KNA00612 record from www.massbank.jp). Taking advantage of the high resolution of the MS spectrometer
(R > 30–40k), mass signals were isolated
(Δm/z < 1 Da, monoisotopic
peak) and mobility
experiments were performed for each molecular ion as a function of
the solvent condition and bath gas composition.

MS spectra for the deprotonated (M = C27H31N9O15P2) and
protonated (M = C27H33N9O15P2) FAD forms. Monoisotopic peaks of the [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+ molecular ions used in the mobility analysis
are highlighted with a dashed rectangle.

Mobility experiments were performed as a function of the
organic
content in the starting solutions (e.g., water–ethanol/methanol
content) using nitrogen as a bath gas (Figure 2). Inspection of the mobility spectrum showed that multiple conformations
exist as a function of the solvent conditions (labels A–L).
Ion-neutral CCSs were determined for all molecular ions observed using
Tuning Mix species as external calibrants (Table 1). Major differences in the relative abundances were not observed
as a function of the starting solution (e.g., organic content) and
the IMS trapping time. This suggests that all structures formed during
the ESI process (labeled A–L) are stable in the TIMS experiments
time scale (50–2000 ms). No changes in the CCS values were
observed as a function of the starting solutions (e.g., water–ethanol/methanol
content) which suggest that the observed IMS bands correspond to different
conformations of FAD and not to organic solvent clustering onto the
molecular ions.

a Energies were

distances (d) between the isoalloxazine and adenine
ring are shown for each conformation.

The conformational heterogeneity of FAD in solution
was characterized
by measuring the FAD lifetime in water–ethanol/methanol mixtures
using frequency domain fluorescence spectroscopy (Figure 3). The data were analyzed using the triple exponential
decay model, and the results are summarized in Table 2. Three distinct components were resolved: a fast component
of ∼270 ps and two nanosecond components with the lifetimes
of 2.43 and 4.6 ns in water. The observed lifetimes are in agreement
with previous reports of FAD emission lifetimes in water and water–ethanol
mixtures.54,55 The fast decaying component of ∼270
ps is attributed to a “closed” FAD conformation with
relatively weak interactions between the isoalloxazine and adenine
ring that lead to a less efficient intramolecular transfer between
the heteroaromatic groups.7,13 The nanosecond lifetimes
of ∼2.5 and ∼4.6 ns correspond to the “partially
open” and “open” FAD conformation, respectively.
In the “open” conformation, the distance between the
isoalloxazine and adenine ring was proposed to be approximately 16
Å, preventing an efficient quenching of the flavine emission.56 An additional lifetime of ∼10 ps (not
resolved in our measurements) was identified in femtosecond fluorescence
lifetime studies and attributed to a “stack” conformation
with the intramolecular distance between the heteroaromatic groups
of ∼4 Å.54 Inspection of Figure 3 and Table 2 shows that the
increase in the organic content (i.e., methanol/ethanol) leads to
the increase in the fraction of the open conformation that is characterized
by ∼4.6 ns lifetime; this is in good agreement with previous
experiments where the increase in the dielectric constant of medium
altered the population of “stack” and “open”
conformations of FAD.54,56

Candidate structures were proposed for IMS bands A–L (Figure 4). For the [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+ molecular ions observed of the deprotonated (M = C27H31N9O15P2) and protonated
(M = C27H33N9O15P2) forms of FAD, the lowest energy structure for each molecular
ion form corresponds to the most abundant IMS band; that is, the lowest
energy structures are the most thermodynamically stable and appear
with the larger relative abundance in the IMS spectra. Both deprotonated
forms of FAD show more IMS bands than the protonated forms. Inspection
of the [M + H]+ molecular ion form of the deprotonated
(C27H31N9O15P2) FAD form shows that the main differences between the candidate
structures proposed for the five IMS bands (A–E) are the distance
and orientation between the adenine and isoalloxazine rings, where
the deprotonation of the phosphate group near the adenine generates
a resonance structure that stabilizes the π–π system
between both rings. The [M + Na]+ molecular ions of the
deprotonated (C27H31N9O15P2) FAD (F–H) form also showed the same orientation
between both aromatic systems with an additional stabilization of
the sodium ion present in the adduct. Moreover, the inspection of
the [M + H]+ molecular ion form of the protonated (C27H33N9O15P2) FAD
form shows that the main differences between the candidate structures
proposed for the (I,J) IMS bands are the interaction between the ring
systems without the stabilization provided by the resonance structure
of the phosphate groups. The [M + Na]+ molecular ions of
the protonated (C27H33N9O15P2) FAD form (K,L) also encounter the destabilization
of the sodium ion present in the adduct. Inspection of the distances
between the rings (4–6 Å) in the proposed candidate structures
showed a good agreement with the solution experiments for the “stack”
and “close” conformations, as well as previous reports.54,56 A candidate structure for the “open” conformation
will result in a CCS of 320 Å2 (see structure in the Supporting Information), but no IMS band was
experimentally observed. The latter suggests that solvation effects
may equilibrate the “open” conformation in solution,
while in the gas phase the ring interaction dominates and stabilizes
in the “stack” and “close” conformations.
Since the molar fraction of the “close” FAD conformation
of ∼270 ps lifetime is higher in the ethanol–water mixture
compared to the methanol–ammonium acetate mixture or methanol–water
mixture, we attribute the fraction of FAD with 270 ps lifetime to
the larger CCSs conformations identified in IMS measurements (e.g.,
band H). Despite that different molecular ions are observed, inspection
of the IMS spectra shows that mainly five IMS bands are detected (considering
the expected CCS small shift between [M + H]+ and [M +
Na]+ ions) but a direct correlation from the number of
IMS bands to the number of fluorescence decay times is not possible.
Moreover, the decay times can be related to the distances between
the isoalloxazine and adenine ring. Inspection of the distances from
the proposed candidate structures shows three main groups: 4.3 Å
(conformer A), 4.8–5.6 Å (conformer B, C, D, F, G, H,
I, J, K, and L), and 5.9 Å (conformer E). That is, the IMS experiments
suggest that at least three decay times should be expected; however,
differences between the distances of the three group of conformers
can be too small to be resolved in lifetime measurements.54,56

structures for the IMS bands observed for the [M + H]+ and
[M + Na]+ molecular ions of the deprotonated
(M = C27H31N9O15P2) and protonated (M = C27H33N9O15P2) FAD forms.

The “solvation” and organic context effect
on the
number of FAD conformations was studied in the TIMS cell by using
dopant gas additives (Figure 5). That is, each
molecular ion conformation is isolated in the TIMS cell, and by introducing
the dopant gas, we studied the influence of the collisional partner
in the FAD conformational space in a single molecular ion–dopant
molecule fashion. Inspection of Figure 5 shows
that the interaction with the collision partner (electrostatic in
nature) results in changes in the relative abundances of the “stack”
and “close” FAD conformers in the absence and presence
of the dopant gas additives. That is, experiments suggest that, at
the molecular level, the interaction with the organic molecules can
induce the transition from “stack” to “close”
conformations. Previous IMS studies have shown that different degrees
of solvation are attainable as a function of the IMS experimental
conditions and can be used (i) to increase IMS separation (e.g., drift
tube, high field, and differential IMS analyzers57−60) and (ii) for structural assignments
(e.g., determination of the solution state structures28,29,36). Polar molecules (e.g., methanol,
ethanol, and acetonitrile) interact with ions very strongly via ion-dipole
interactions (since they have a permanent dipole moment). Although
changes in the IMS profile occurred with the dopant introduction (i.e.,
structure L and K relative abundances), the transition into the “open”
conformation was not observed. The later suggest that a higher abundance
of dopant molecules with respect to the bath gas is necessary to reach
the FAD “open” state. Comparison between the solution
and gas phase results suggest that the FAD solution state distribution
can be preserved in the gas phase and gas-phase conformation-friendly
conditions can be induced using dopant gases. Moreover, in both solution
and gas phase, FAD three-dimensional structures are determined by
the interplay between intramolecular interactions (e.g., π–π
system formed by the adenine and isoalloxazine rings) and interactions
with the surrounding solvent/gas molecules. The workflow described
here (TIMS-MS combined with MD using gas dopants) provides a powerful
tool for the investigation of the gas phase “solvation”
state of molecular ions.

FAD form (M = C27H33N9O15P2) as a function of the bath gas conditions. Notice the
variation of the relative abundances of IMS bands as a function of
the bath gas composition using ethanol, methanol, and acetonitrile
as additives in the TIMS mobility cell.

Conclusions
In the current study, TIMS-MS combined fluorescence
time decay
and theoretical calculations were used to study FAD conformational
space. Gas-phase experimental results showed that [M + H]+ and [M + Na]+ molecular ions are observed during ESI
for the deprotonated (C27H31N9O15P2) and protonated (C27H33N9O15P2) FAD forms. For the first
time, CCSs of 12 FAD conformations found by IMS experiments are reported
and compared with theoretical calculations of candidate structures
that correspond to the “stack” and “close”
conformations identified in solution by fluorescence lifetime measurements.
The abundance of each conformer was consistent with their relative
stability; that is, the larger intensity observed for a conformer
corresponds to the most stable conformer. The examination of the conformational
space generated by the candidate structures shows that the main motif
that defines FAD conformational space is the interaction between the
isoalloxazine and adenine groups. It was shown that the use of dopants
in the TIMS cell permits the investigation of single molecular ion–dopant
molecule interaction and can be used to study the gas-phase “solvation”
state of biological molecules.
