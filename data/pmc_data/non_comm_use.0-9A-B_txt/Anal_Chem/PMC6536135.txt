Many atmospheric
organic compounds are long-lived enough to be
transported from their sources to polar regions and high mountain
environments where they can be trapped in ice archives. While inorganic
components in ice archives have been studied extensively to identify
past climate changes, organic compounds have rarely been used to assess
paleo-environmental changes, mainly due to the lack of suitable analytical
methods. This study presents a new method of direct injection high
performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) analysis,
without the need of preconcentrating the melted ice, for the determination
of a series of novel biomarkers in ice core samples indicative of
primary and secondary terrestrial and marine organic aerosol sources.
Eliminating a preconcentration step reduces contamination potential
and decreases the required sample volume thus allowing a higher time
resolution in the archives. The method is characterized by limits
of detection (LODs) in the range of 0.01–15 ppb, depending
on the analyte, and accuracy evaluated through an interlaboratory
comparison. We find that many components in secondary organic aerosols
(SOAs) are clearly detectable at concentrations comparable to those
previously observed in replicate preconcentrated ice samples from
the Belukha glacier, Russian Altai Mountains. Some compounds with
low recoveries in the preconcentration steps are now detectable in
samples with this new direct injection method significantly increasing
the range of environmental processes and sources that become accessible
for paleo-climate studies.

==== Body
The analysis
and quantification
of nonanthropogenic marine and terrestrial organic compounds in ice
cores is a developing field presenting a new suite of compounds potentially
applicable to paleo-environmental reconstruction.1 A small selection of studies obtaining new records of various
novel organic compounds in ice has proven the concept; Kawamura et
al.2 detected lipid compounds in snow layers
dating back 450 years at Site J, Greenland, using gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC/MS); Pokhrel et al.3 detected
oxidation products of isoprene and monoterpenes in ice up to 350 years
old in Alaska using GC/MS on rotary evaporation-preconcentrated samples,
and Müller-Tautges et al.4 detected
carboxylic acids and inorganic ions between 1942 and 1993 from Grenzgletscher
(Monte Rosa Massif) in the southern Swiss Alps using high performance
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) on stir-bar preconcentrated
samples. Following this, King et al.5 developed
a method of HPLC-MS analysis for rotary evaporation-preconcentrated
ice samples. We quantified concentrations of a wide range of novel
organic compounds in ice core samples, which had shown good potential
for survival during transport to, and preservation within, ice core
records, and relationships to environmental conditions.1 These included a range of fatty acids, secondary
oxidation aerosol compounds, and primary biogenic molecules at both
detectable and reproducible concentrations.

Adaptation of methods
toward those not requiring preconcentration
has been previously successfully applied to levoglucosan, an organic
compound produced by combustion of cellulose and used to indicate
past biomass burning trends from ice core analysis. In order both
to circumnavigate the need for preconcentration and to avoid more
time-consuming GC/MS methods, Gambaro et al.6 developed the first method of direct injection HPLC-triple quadrupole
mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS/MS) for quantification of levoglucosan
in Antarctic ice samples, where concentrations are expected to be
very low. They achieved detection limits as low as 0.003 ppb in samples
as small as 1 mL, reproducible at 20–50%, while lowering analysis
time and contamination risk, demonstrating the potential benefits
of this process.

In this study, we compare our previous method5 for preconcentrated samples with a similar one
for use
on non-preconcentrated snow and ice samples, i.e., direct injection
HPLC-MS (see Table 1for the compound list).

b Surrogate standards (analytes chemically
similar to those being extracted when the actual standard is not available).

While preconcentration is still
needed in many cases due to the
very low levels of organic compounds in polar and alpine ice samples
(typically parts per trillion (ppt, equivalent to ng/L) to parts per
billion (ppb, equivalent to μg/L)), some samples closer to the
source location may contain higher compound concentrations detectable
without requiring such a step. Alternatively, new instrumentation
presents the opportunity to analyze samples at detection levels as
low as ppt, thus removing the need for preconcentration. The elimination
of a preconcentration step would be beneficial for several reasons;
reducing the processing steps of samples reduces the possibility for
introduction of contamination, especially in the case of fatty acids
where background contamination is generally high compared to secondary
organic aerosol (SOA) compounds.5 Additionally,
for some of the compounds on our target list, preconcentration has
been ineffective, due to very low recovery. For example, the rotary
evaporation method previously applied in King et al.5 showed very low recovery for oxidized biogenic aerosol
markers such as MBTCA. Direct injection, if suitable detection limits
can be achieved, opens up these additional compounds to ice core analysis
and, therefore, offers an enhanced suite of compounds for paleo-environmental
reconstruction. Finally, the required sample volume for direct injection
is also much smaller, in this case, approximately 100 μL per
sample rather than 10 mL for a sample requiring preconcentration,
thus improving the depth and time resolution that can be attained
from the ice core. As an example, this will often allow seasonally
resolved samples to be analyzed, as opposed to annual or multiannual
records, which will be invaluable to develop an understanding of the
processes and sources these novel organic paleo-environmental markers
represent. This may also be particularly useful when evolving the
method to analyze much older ice than that currently tested, where
annual ice layers are much thinner, due to ice flow, than those in
younger, shallower counterparts. As a long-term perspective, methods
requiring low sample volume may be amenable to adaptation for coupling
with continuous flow analysis systems (e.g., Kaufmann et al.15). Finally, the use of high-resolution MS without
sample preconcentration would allow retrospective nontargeted analysis,
whereas the sample preconcentration step invariably alters the samples
representatively.

Materials and Methods
Sample analysis
was carried out by direct injection ultrahigh performance
liquid chromatography (UHPLC) electrospray ionization (ESI) high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) with a postcolumn injection of ammonium hydroxide
in methanol.

Standard Solutions and Eluents
Bulk standard solutions
were prepared in dichloromethane (>99.9%, Optima, HPLC/MS, Fisher
Chemical) and acetonitrile (>99.9%, Optima HPLC/MS, Fisher Chemical)
and then combined into a diluted standard mixture of all analytes
at a concentration of 1 ppm in acetonitrile. Details of the sources
and purities of each compound standard can be found in King et al.5 Final standards for instrument calibration, quantification
of detection limits, and quantification of matrix effects were made
at concentrations of 10 ppt, 100 ppt, 1 ppb, 10 ppb, and 100 ppb by
dilutions with water (>99.9%, Optima UHPLC/MS, Fisher Chemical).

Decontamination Protocols
All glassware was baked at
450 °C for 8 h using the method of Müller-Tautges et al.7 Glassware was capped with PTFE lined lids. Solvents
were also cleaned using ozonation following the method of King et
al.,5 which has been shown to reduce background
contamination of unsaturated fatty acids.

Instrumental Analysis
Analysis was carried out using
an UltiMate3000 UHPLC coupled with a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive
Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap MS at the Department of Chemical Sciences,
University of Padua, Italy. We utilized this more sensitive instrument
than that used in the methodological development of the previous study.
The interlaboratory comparison described in the previous study shows
how this instrument lowered detection limits to the range of ppt for
many compounds in comparison to the HPLC-ESI-HRMS (with Accela system
HPLC (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) coupled to an LTQ Velos
Orbitrap (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany)) at the University of
Cambridge, UK, which did not achieve detection limits below ppb concentrations
(Table 2). Given that
concentrations of compounds detected in preconcentrated samples in
King et al.5 were in the order of ppb,
this more sensitive instrument not only should allow detection of
these compounds without preconcentration but also may allow detection
of previously undetected compounds. This is due in part to the different
detectors in the two instruments, which gives the Q-Exactive a better
sensitivity and thus lower detection limits. Similarly, a triple quadrupole
mass analyzer may provide better sensitivity for SOA compounds while
it would not give reliable determination of unsubstituted fatty acids
when using HPLC with an ESI source. This is because the fragmentation
used in the single and multiple reaction monitoring when using triple
quadrupole mass analyzers cannot be exploited for the determination
of unsubstituted fatty acids, which would lose the only functional
group that can be easily ionized (the carboxylic group). Further factors
giving the Q-Exactive better sensitivity are that the ionic path is
much shorter than for the Velos, resulting in less ion scattering,
and that the Q-Exactive has an enhanced vacuum, increasing the electronic
performance. There are also factors, which are unique to every instrument
setup and specific laboratory environment: the contamination introduced
into the instrument is dependent on the working environment in which
the instrument sits, the previous samples analyzed, and also the age
of the instrument. Besides these, removing a sample preconcentration
procedure may reduce potential contaminations introduced during sample
handling. In this study, we account for these factors by repeating
some optimization steps applied to the previously used instrument,
as discussed further in Methodological Optimization.

The optimized settings
of the instrument were those developed by
King et al.5 and were as follows: the LC
injected sample volumes of 20 μL and used a Waters XBridge C18
(3.5 μm, 3.0 × 150 mm) column with the mobile phases (A)
water with 0.5 mM NH4OH and (B) methanol with 0.5 mM NH4OH. The gradient program was 0–3 min 0% B, 3–4
min linear gradient from 0% to 30% B, 4–9 min 30% B, 9–10
min linear gradient from 30% to 100% B, 10–25 min 100% B, 25–26
min linear gradient from 100% to 0% B, 26–35 min 0% B, with
a 250 μL/min flow rate at 20 °C. We applied a postcolumn
injection of methanol with 5 mM NH4OH at a flow rate of
100 μL/min. MS analysis was performed in negative ionization
using the following ESI source parameters: 400 °C source temperature,
40 arbitrary units (a.u.) sheath gas flow rate, 20 a.u. auxiliary
gas flow rate, 3.5 kV needle voltage, 350 °C transfer capillary
temperature, and S-Lens RF Level 50%. MS spectra were collected in
full scan, with a resolution of 70 000 at m/z 400, in the mass range m/z 80–600 and in MS/MS for all target compounds with
a collision-induced dissociation (CID) energy of 30 (normalized collision
energy). Instrumental calibration was carried out routinely to within
an accuracy of ±2 ppm, using Pierce LTQ Velos ESI Positive Ion
Calibration Solution and a Pierce ESI Negative Ion Calibration Solution
(Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany).

Calibration for quantification
of target analytes was carried out
at the start of each sample series, for which analysis took approximately
60 continuous hours, using standard solutions of 10 ppt, 100 ppt,
1 ppb, 10 ppb, and 100 ppb. Deuterated internal standards malic acid-d3, pimelic acid-d10, and palmitic acid-d31 at a concentration
of 10 ppb were used as internal standards to adjust concentrations
accounting for methodological and instrumental variability. Quality
check standard solutions at a concentration of 10 ppb have also been
analyzed every 10 samples to ensure no changes in detection sensitivity
throughout the sequence of analysis.

Sample Preparation
Ice samples analyzed were from the
Belukha glacier ice core, Russian Altai mountains, for which details
on drilling, transportation, and cutting can be found in Olivier et
al.8 A total of 18 samples were tested
representing ice from a range of ice core ages, accounting for differences
in ice chemistry and physical ice properties, which may affect analysis.
These were 12 samples from 1866 to 1869 and 6 samples from 1821 to
1823.

Sample sections were cut to avoid the outermost ice of
the core, which has been exposed to potential contamination. Additionally,
once cut, samples for the analysis of organic compounds were scraped
with a metal scalpel to remove cut surfaces and placed directly in
precleaned amber glass vials with PTFE lined caps. Samples were stored
at −25 °C before melting in sealed vials inside a class
100 clean room at approximately 16 °C. Each sample represented
10 cm ice core resolution, equivalent to subannual resolution. One
mL of the well-mixed sample was transferred to a glass LC-MS vial
and spiked with 10 ppb deuterated standards for immediate analysis.

Results and Discussion
Methodological Optimization
While
the HPLC-MS method
was optimized in our previous study5, some
parameters were retested to ensure the methodology was appropriate
for the new instrument (i.e., the Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS). This particularly
included steps in reducing background contamination, which can be
different for individual compounds depending on the instrument and
lab environment being used.

The repeated tests were: testing
of non-ozonated and ozonated solvents, testing of the inclusion of
a postcolumn injection, and the application of MS-MS analysis to ensure
correct identification of peaks in the mass spectra.

On average,
the application of a postcolumn injection of 5 mM NH4OH
in methanol increased peak areas by 1.5 to 2 times compared
to peak areas without a postcolumn injection. The use of ozonated
solvents was again shown to be effective at reducing background contamination
of unsaturated fatty acids, which break down during ozonolysis; in
nonozonated solvents, these compounds were present at contamination
levels of ≥10 ppb, while ozonated solvents allowed detection
at as low as 10 ppt.

Instrumental analysis showed that the retention
time of some compounds
shifted when comparing preconcentration/direct injection analysis.
This is because the solvent of the final sample (and standard solutions)
is different in the two cases; in the preconcentrated samples, the
solvent is methanol, used to redissolve the compounds from the rotary
evaporation vial. In direct injection, the solvent is the snowmelt
water of the sample or LC-MS water for the standard solutions. The
retention times for the direct injection, aqueous sample are presented
in Table 2. In general,
the retention times of SOA compounds are slightly shorter while retention
times of fatty acids are longer for samples and standard solutions
in water compared with methanol.5

Methodological
Validation
Instrumental limits of detection
(LODs) were evaluated on standard solutions prepared in water to match
the matrix of the ice samples. Calculation used the Hubaux–Vos
method, following IUPAC recommendations.9,10 Limits of
quantifications (LOQs) are 10/(3 × LOD). Sensitivity (slope of
the calibration line) and linearity range were tested using both the
r-Pearson correlation test and the F-test to compare linear and quadratic
fits. Results showed a good linearity in the tested range (10 ppt
to 100 ppb) for all compounds. Method/instrumental repeatability was
evaluated in real ice core samples. Validation parameters are reported
in Table 2.

Matrix
effects of direct injection samples were tested by comparing the linear
calibration lines of two different sets of prepared standards, each
analyzed in triplicate: one set of 1, 10, and 100 ppb concentrations
diluted with water (external calibration) and another of the same
concentrations diluted with ice sample melt made by pooling together
aliquots of the different ice samples analyzed in this study (internal
calibration). A comparison of the slopes of the lines, using a t test, was used to evaluate the difference in values quantified
between the two standard types. This approach was used instead of
the postcolumn infusion and post-extraction addition protocols11 due to unavailability of blank samples (i.e.,
melted ice samples free from target analytes). Results show (Table 2) the presence of
a small but significant matrix effect for most of the analytes. Analytes
with lower background contaminations are generally also less affected
by matrix effects while compounds with higher background contaminations
are more affected by matrix effects (e.g., fatty acids). Isotopically
labeled (deuterated) standards do not compensate for matrix effects,
probably due to slight differences in lipophilicity and ion suppression
effects, as observed in previous studies.12,13

Method Comparison
A method comparison was done to assess
the accuracy of the direct injection UHPLC-ESI-HRMS method, comparing
ice samples from the Belukha glacier ice core measured both with the
method developed in this study and with the method developed by King
et al.5 The method of King et al.5 used rotary-evaporation to preconcentrate the
samples before analysis with HPLC-ESI-HRMS using an Accela system
HPLC (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) coupled to an LTQ Velos
Orbitrap (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany).5 An interlaboratory comparison has already been carried out by King
et al.5 showing that sample concentrations
measured on the previously used instrument are reliably reproduced
on the instrument used in this study, and therefore, our sample concentrations
of the preconcentrated method are accurate and may be reliably compared
to the direct injection samples.

Compounds detected in the preconcentrated
Belukha samples were as follows: d-malic acid, terebic acid,
methyl-tetrols, pimelic acid, keto-pinic acid, cis-pinonic acid, heptacosanoic acid, octacosanoic acid, and melissic
acid. MBTCA was detected in very few samples above the detection limits.
In the direct injection method, compounds detected were MBTCA, d-malic acid, terebic acid, methyl-tetrols, pimelic acid, and
keto-pinic acid. BTCA and cis-pinonic acid were detected
in some of the direct injection samples but in others were below the
LODs. In comparison, the direct injection promoted BTCA and MBTCA
detection, as the recovery percentage for both compounds in preconcentrated
samples was only 3%, the lowest value observed for all compounds,5 which results in values falling below the LOD
in these samples. Avoiding this drawback, the direct injection method
successfully detects MBTCA in all samples well above the LODs.

All of the fatty acids detected with the preconcentration technique
were below detection limits in the direct injection samples; this
is because background contamination levels were high in these experiments
and, consequently, so are LODs.

The results of the comparison
between the preconcentrated and direct
injection samples are shown in Figure 1, as scatterplots
representing the reproducibility of final concentration values in
the samples. The scatterplots show good linearity for all compounds,
indicating that trends in the sample time series are reliably reproduced.
For some compounds, the linear trend lines deviate from the 1:1 ratio
line, for example, terebic acid. This difference is not accounted
for by matrix effects evaluated using a test ice sample melt (see Methodological Validation for details). However,
each individual ice sample would be characterized by a different matrix
composition, which may affect quantification differently from one
sample to another. In each case, the deviation from the 1:1 ratio
line suggests either a lower-than-expected sample concentration in
the direct injection samples or a higher-than-expected concentration
in the preconcentrated samples. This may be because preconcentrated
samples are finally analyzed in methanol, used to redissolve the samples
from the dried vial following rotary evaporation, whereas direct injection
samples are measured in the original snowmelt. It would be expected
that methanol is an overall cleaner sample as the lower solubility
discourages the presence of inorganics in the sample, which may otherwise
interfere with the ionization of the analytes in the ESI source. Ideally,
matrix effects could be accounted for by using an internal calibration.
However, this is not a viable alternative for this application due
to the limited amount of sample available for the analysis.

Figure 1 Scatterplots
representing comparisons between final sample concentrations
of each of direct injection and preconcentration methods of analysis
of replicate environmental samples. Linear trend lines and associated R2 values are presented to assess reproducibility,
and error bands at 95% confidence intervals are shown in pink. The
bracketed outlying point in the pimelic acid plot is shown but not
included in the trend line and R2 value.
Compounds shown are those with a complete data set (i.e., no sample
concentrations below detection limits).

The observed offset, where large enough to be significant
such
as for terebic acid, may be quantified and accounted for in further
analysis.

Because of the poor detection of MBTCA in the preconcentrated
samples,
we cannot assess the reproducibility of this compound compared to
direct injection. We instead compare to previously reported ions in
the ice core14 to see if overall trends
detected in the sample series appear reasonable. Figure 2 compares MBTCA to sulfate.
Sulfate was chosen for comparison as it showed the most significant
correlation to MBTCA of all the other measured ions in the core (R2 = 0.55). We display only the corresponding
sample numbers since environmental interpretation is outside the scope
of this study. The record shows that both compounds display similar
trends over time, with peaks coinciding with midyear summertime. Therefore,
MBTCA measured by direct injection produces results that are reasonable
with previous findings. Indeed, this is also the case for all other
new organic compounds detected; i.e., the trends match those of previously
detected ions. However, we save the presentation of the results for
future work alongside environmental interpretation.

core samples.

Conclusions
A
method for analyzing a series of organic compounds in ice core
samples by direct injection UHPLC-ESI/HRMS is presented. This method
is beneficial in reducing the required sample volume and the potential
for contamination generated by sample preconcentration steps. The
method provides LODs of 0.01–3.02 ppb for SOA compounds and
0.44–15.75 ppb for fatty acids, with average instrumental repeatability
of 7%. Small, but significant, matrix effects (∼10% on average)
were determined.

This direct injection analytical method is
particularly suitable
for SOA compounds, which showed low recoveries in preconcentrated
samples, e.g., MBTCA, and which are significantly above detection
limits only with direct injection analysis. Other SOA compounds, detected
more clearly than MBTCA in preconcentrated samples, were also detected
with similar sensitivity in direct injection samples. Many of the
studied tracers showed good reproducibility in final sample concentrations
in both analytical methods, while others showed a lower-than-expected
concentration in direct injection samples compared with preconcentrated
samples. This can be accounted for by differences in sample matrices
or ionization efficiency in samples analyzed with the two techniques
and can be adjusted for in final sample concentrations.

Direct
injection is less suitable for fatty acid compounds; their
high background contamination results in high detection limits, and
thus, these compounds are more suited to analyses after a preconcentration.
Alternatively, detection limits for these compounds require new, tailored,
cleaning protocols to reduce background contamination in the solvents
and in the instrument itself before direct injection analysis.
