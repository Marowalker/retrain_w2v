Ultrafast
Laplace NMR (UF-LNMR), which is based on the spatial
encoding of multidimensional data, enables one to carry out 2D relaxation
and diffusion measurements in a single scan. Besides reducing the
experiment time to a fraction, it significantly facilitates the use
of nuclear spin hyperpolarization to boost experimental sensitivity,
because the time-consuming polarization step does not need to be repeated.
Here we demonstrate the usability of hyperpolarized UF-LNMR in the
context of cell metabolism, by investigating the conversion of pyruvate
to lactate in the cultures of mouse 4T1 cancer cells. We show that 13C ultrafast diffusion–T2 relaxation correlation measurements, with the sensitivity enhanced
by several orders of magnitude by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization
(D-DNP), allows the determination of the extra- vs intracellular
location of metabolites because of their significantly different values
of diffusion coefficients and T2 relaxation
times. Under the current conditions, pyruvate was located predominantly
in the extracellular pool, while lactate remained primarily intracellular.
Contrary to the small flip angle diffusion methods reported in the
literature, the UF-LNMR method does not require several scans with
varying gradient strength, and it provides a combined diffusion and T2 contrast. Furthermore, the ultrafast concept
can be extended to various other multidimensional LNMR experiments,
which will provide detailed information about the dynamics and exchange
processes of cell metabolites.

==== Body
In cancer
research, cardiovascular
imaging, and diabetes research, metabolic differences between normal
and diseased tissues can be accessed noninvasively by nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR).1,2 Hyperpolarization by dissolution
dynamic nuclear polarization (D-DNP) has been shown to provide unprecedented
gains in NMR signal.3 In recent years,
D-DNP has enabled the determination of metabolic pathways and measurement
of metabolic flux both in cell cultures and in vivo using magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI).4,513C NMR of
various hyperpolarized precursors, including pyruvate, glucose, bicarbonate,
fumarate, and others, serves as probes for specific metabolic pathways.
The observation time window of 13C nuclei is wide because
of their long T1, and their broad chemical
shift range facilitates the resolution of metabolites.

A challenge
in studies of metabolism by NMR is that compounds inside
and outside of cells are not resolved in the spectra. Furthermore,
individual cells are smaller than the achieved spatial resolution
in MRI. Therefore, only a combination of extracellular and intracellular
locations is observed. The separation of these compartments can be
achieved through measurement of diffusion.6 Restrictions in the intracellular environment, such as macromolecular
binding and boundaries due to compartmentation, lead to an intracellular
diffusion coefficient of metabolites that is significantly smaller
than that in the extracellular space. Diffusion magnetic resonance
spectroscopy therefore can be used to evaluate membrane transport,
which itself can serve as a marker for tumor diagnosis.7

However, conventional diffusion measurements,8,9 which
require multiple incremental scans, are a priori not compatible with
hyperpolarization, because the signal is short-lived, and repolarization
using D-DNP takes place ex situ and with build-up times much longer
than the scan time, from tens of minutes to hours. The diffusion contrast
becomes available through the use of small flip angle excitations
with various diffusion encoding steps. Therefore, 13C hyperpolarized
metabolite signals have been distinguished in different cellular compartments
in vitro10 and in vivo.11

Recently, we have shown that multidimensional NMR
diffusion and
relaxation data12−14 can be measured with a single scan.15−19 This method is termed ultrafast Laplace NMR (UF-LNMR). Similar to
ultrafast NMR spectroscopy20−23 as well as single scan one-dimensional diffusion24−26 and relaxation experiments,27,28 the method is based
on spatial encoding of multidimensional data. The distribution of
the relaxation times and/or diffusion coefficients is obtained by
a Laplace inversion.29−31 The single scan approach makes it possible to use
hyperpolarized substances to boost the experimental sensitivity by
several orders of magnitude.32,33

We have previously
demonstrated substantial sensitivity enhancements
in diffusion–T2 relaxation (D–T2) correlation UF-LNMR
of solvents and hydrocarbons, using hyperpolarization by D-DNP and para-hydrogen induced polarization.16 Here, we extend this technique to the analysis of cell metabolism
in biological samples. To enable separation of metabolites by chemical
identity, we introduce a chemical shift selective, pulsed-field gradient
spin echo (PGSE) based UF D–T2 LNMR experiment, which enabled us to carry out the experiment
with a single selective pulse only. This is important, because several
selective pulses of extended duration can cause unintended evolution
of coherences and significant decay of signal; the pulsed-field gradient
stimulated echo (PGSTE) based UF D–T2 experiment used in the previous work16 would require several selective π/2 pulses.
We show that this experiment enables the differentiation of diffusion
coefficients consistent with intracellular and extracellular locations
of 13C hyperpolarized pyruvate and its metabolic product
lactate in mouse 4T1 breast cancer cells. Contrary to the small flip
angle diffusion measurements described above, the UF-LNMR method does
not require repetition of experiments with multiple diffusion encoding
steps or prior knowledge of diffusion coefficients in the compartments.
Furthermore, it provides a combined D and T2 contrast, which improves the resolution of
the components.

Experimental Section
Cell Cultures
4T1 mouse breast cancer cells were maintained
as a monolayer and grown in RPMI-1640 medium (ThermoFisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
(10 000 U/mL) in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C.
The cells were passaged serially and used for NMR experiments between
passages 3 to 5. Single cell suspensions were derived by trypsinization
with 0.1% (w/v) trypsin/0.04% (w/v) ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) in 3 min. For NMR measurements, cells with ∼90%
confluency from eight culture plates (surface area = 75 cm2 per plate; VWR, Radnor, PA) were collected by trypsinization and
centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 0.5 mL of phosphate buffer
(0.2 g/L KCl, 0.2 g/L KH2PO4, 8.0 g/L NaCl,
1.15 g/L Na2HPO4, pH 7.25). The cell suspension
was transferred to the first injection loop, for nonhyperpolarized
sample, of a liquid driven sample injector for D-DNP NMR spectroscopy.34 This transfer occurred shortly before the NMR
experiment, in order to maintain cell viability. The number of cells
was ∼2.5 × 108 in the injection loop, and ∼1
× 108 after injection into a flow cell preinstalled
in the NMR magnet.

Hyperpolarization
A solution of
1 M 13C1-pyruvate (Cambridge Isotopes, Tewksbury,
MA) with 15 mM Tris[8-carboxy-2,2,6,6-tetrakis(2-hydroxyethyl)benzo[1,2-d:4,5-d′]bis[1,3]-dithiol-4-yl]methyl
free radical sodium salt (OX063; Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, U.K.)
was prepared in a D2O/ethylene glycol (2/3 v/v) glass forming
mixture. This sample solution (8 μL) was hyperpolarized on 13C for 3 h at 1.4 K in a HyperSense DNP polarizer (Oxford
Instruments), by irradiating microwaves with 60 mW power at a frequency
of 93.974 GHz in a 3.35 T magnetic field. The hyperpolarized sample
was rapidly dissolved in preheated phosphate buffer (10 mM Na2HPO4, 100 mg/L EDTA, pH 7.4) and transferred into
the second loop of the liquid driven sample injector. The cell and
hyperpolarized pyruvate samples were subsequently driven into a mixer
and then into a flow cell preinstalled in the magnet, using water
from a high pressure syringe pump (model 1000D, Teledyne ISCO, Lincoln,
NE). The final temperature was 308 K during NMR measurement. This
temperature was determined by measuring a 1H hyperpolarized
spectrum of ethylene glycol (EG) sample (EG/D2O (3/2, v/v)
and 15 mM 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPOL)
free radical (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)) as a chemical shift thermometer35 with the same injection time as used in the
experiments. The liquid state spin polarization of 13C1-pyruvate was ∼20%.

NMR Spectra
Spectra
were acquired on a 400 MHz NMR
spectrometer with a triple resonance TXI probe (Bruker Biospin, Billerica,
MA) and installed NMR flow cell. The time evolution of 13C signals was determined using the pulse sequence (trigger–[Gz–α–acquire]×n). A total of n = 64 transients were acquired over
a duration of 320 s. A pulsed-field gradient Gz(45.5
G/cm, 1 ms) was applied for attenuation of coherences present from
the previous scans. The small flip angle α of the excitation
pulse was 10°, with pulse strength (γB1)/2π = 17.86 kHz. In each scan, a total of 12 000
complex points were acquired with an acquisition time of 0.5 s. The
NMR experiment was triggered after 800 ms of injection and mixing
time and 5 s of waiting time.

UF D–T2
UF D–T2 LNMR
measurements incorporating chemical shift selection on pyruvate or
lactate 13C resonances at 170.4 or 182.6 ppm were performed
in single scans. The experiments were carried out for 20 s after the
injection. In the pulse sequence, a PGSE based chemical shift selective
excitation pulse was used for the UF D–T2 LNMR measurements, where 13C resonances
of pyruvate or lactate were selectively excited. As shown in Figure 1, the first π/2
was a selective 90° Gaussian pulse with 1% truncation level,
applied at the center of a 13C resonance. The pulse duration
was 8488 μs and excitation bandwidth was 249 Hz. The following
two π pulses were frequency-swept chirp pulses with 10% smoothing
on the edges. The pulse duration (tchirp) was 2.5 ms, bandwidth was 48.7 kHz, and (γB1max)/2π was 3.94 kHz. The power of the π
pulse in the CPMG loop was (γB1)/2π
= 17.86 kHz. Pulsed-field gradients were trapezoidal shaped with ramp
time of 1 ms. Gradients were applied with amplitudes Gdiff = 36.4 G/cm, Gdephase = 2.3 G/cm, Gread = 2.3 G/cm, and durations tG,diff = 5.0 ms, tG,dephase = 8.9 ms, tG,read = 16.9 ms. The diffusion
delay was Δ = 50 ms. The simultaneously applied Gdiff and frequency-swept π pulse resulted in a spatial
dependence of the effective length of Gdiff that a spin experiences in the range of δeff =
0···5 ms. The number of complex points in each echo
was 256, and altogether, 64 echoes were collected in the CPMG loop
with the time interval of 20 ms. The spectral width was 25 kHz. The
total experiment time was texp = 1.4 s.

Figure 1 Ultrafast D–T2 correlation experiment
used in the present work.

Reference Diffusion Experiments
A conventional pulsed-field
gradient stimulated echo experiment (PGSTE) was used for diffusion
measurements without hyperpolarization, using thermally polarized 1H signals of a pyruvate sample previously used in the hyperpolarized D–T2 measurement without
cell suspension (Figure S-1). This pulse
sequence consisted of [p1 – G1–p1 – τ1/G2–p1–G3–acquire]×n. 90° hard pulses p1 were applied with (γB1)/2π = 28.97 kHz. Diffusion encoding
and decoding gradients, G1 and G3, respectively, were simultaneously
and linearly increased from 1.17 to 55.58 G/cm with n = 16 steps. The diffusion time Δ, which is from the start
of G1 to the start of G3, was 80 ms. The gradient duration δ
was 0.9 ms. The delay τ1 = 78 ms. A homospoil gradient
G2 was applied with amplitude −10.02 G/cm and duration δhomospoil = 0.85 ms. The z-gradient strength
was calibrated using a H2O sample with known diffusion
coefficient of 2.3 · 10–9 m2/s at T = 298.2 K (Figure S-2, details
of calibration below).

A conventional PGSTE experiment was used
for calibration of z-gradient strength G. 1H signals of thermally polarized water were measured
at T = 298.2 K. The pulse sequence is the same as
that used for diffusion measurement of a thermally polarized pyruvate
sample (Figure S-1). Experimental parameters
are (γB1)/2π = 28.57 kHz,
Δ = 100 ms, δ = 1.1 ms, τ1 = 98 ms, and δhomospoil = 0.8 ms.

Residual motions in the sample after injection were
assessed using
the same single scan ultrafast D–T2 measurement as in the cell metabolism experiments. A
selective 90° Gaussian pulse is applied at the center of 1H resonances of water at 4.7 ppm (see Table S-1 for experimental parameters). As shown in Figure S-3, the sample was already stationary
after 20 s of stabilization, with an apparent diffusion coefficient
of (3.3 ± 1.0) · 10–9 m2/s,
compared to the reference value of 2.9 · 10–9 m2/s.36 The agreement of these
diffusion coefficients within error limits indicates that the D-DNP
sample is nearly stationary during data acquisition, validating the
stopped-flow injection into the NMR flow cell. In this approach, the
flow path is pinched both in the inlet and outlet tubing after delivering
the sample into the cell, therefore preventing large scale flow of
the sample during NMR measurement.34 Furthermore,
no gas bubbles were observed at the time of measurement, which was
also confirmed by a one-dimensional imaging experiment (Figure S-4).

A pulsed-field gradient echo
experiment was used for a one-dimensional
image measurement. The pulse sequence consists of elements [p1–G1−τ1–p2–G2/acquire]. p1 and p2
are 90o and 180° hard pulses with γB1/(2π) = 27.03 kHz. G1 and G2 are denoted as defocusing
and refocusing pulsed-field gradients with gradient strength 1.95
G/cm. The gradient duration of G2 = 17.88 ms is twice as long as that
of G1. The delay τ1 = 1.1 ms. The
coincidence of red and black curves in Figure S-4 demonstrates that no gas bubbles were observed after 15
s waiting time.

Data Analysis
For determining time
evolution from 13C NMR spectra, the raw data was filled
to 65 536 complex
data points and multiplied with an exponential window function with
a line broadening of 0.3 Hz before Fourier transform, using TOPSPIN
3.5 (Bruker Biospin). All peak integration and curve fitting were
conducted using the Matlab program (MathWorks, Natick, MA).

For a hyperpolarized 13C UF D–T2 experiment, the data was first Fourier transformed
along the direction of spatial encoding. 33 data points were in the
encoding region. Then, the data outside, close to the beginning, and
at the end of the encoding region was removed, see Refs (16,37). After this, the number of data points in
the diffusion and T2 dimensions were 19
and 64, respectively. The range of the effective diffusion gradient
pulse length was δeff = [0.94 ms,
3.75 ms], and the time range was tCPMG = [0.02 ms, 1.28 ms]. The 2D diffusion coefficient and T2 relaxation time distributions were determined using
a Laplace inversion program provided by P. Callaghan (Victoria University
of Wellington, New Zealand)38 and based
on a previously published method.29 The
size of the D–T2 data was 25 × 19. The distributions covered the following ranges: T2 = [0.01 s, 50 s] and D =
[5 × 10–11 m2/s, 10–8 m2/s].

For the 1H UF D–T2 experiment as shown in Figure S-3, a Laplace inversion was applied as
described above. A range of δeff = [0.87 ms, 2.63 ms] and tCPMG = [0.02
ms, 1.28 ms] was used. 63 data points were
in the encoding region. The number of data points in the diffusion
and T2 dimensions were 29 and 64, respectively.
The D–T2 data
size was 20 × 40. Correlation diagrams covered ranges T2 = [0.01 s, 20 s] and D =
[5 × 10–11 m2/s, 10–8 m2/s].

Modeling of Signal Intensities in the Spectra
Signal
intensities in the hyperpolarized 13C spectra (see Figure 2), Mz,pyr and Mz,lac, can be quantitatively modeled using the following
equations39 1   2  

Figure 2 (a) Stacked
plot of 13C spectra measured with a time
interval of 5 s after injection of hyperpolarized 13C1-pyruvate to 4T1 cancer cells. The inset shows the spectrum
at the time point of 20 s, where the D–T2 measurements were performed. (b) Scheme of
a cancer cell, indicating membrane transport of pyruvate and lactate

pyruvate dehydrogenase. (c) Integrals and kinetic fit of pyruvate
and lactate signals as a function of time. All signal integrals were
normalized with the maximum pyruvate signal integral.

The observed rate constant for the conversion from
pyruvate to
lactate, kpyr–lac, depends on the
cell density in the experiment. It includes contributions from the
lactate dehydrogenase activity as well as from the membrane transport
of pyruvate. Since no statistical improvement in the fit was found
by considering the conversion of lactate to pyruvate, the rate constant klac–pyr is neglected. R1,pyr and R1,lac are the relaxation
rates on the carbonyl sites. The parameter λ = −ln(cos(α))/Δt, with α = 10° and Δt = 5 s as the time interval
between two scans, accounts for signal depletion due to the small
flip angle pulses. For the experimental data from Figure 2c, the resulting fit parameters
are kpyr–lac = 6.5 · 10–3 s–1, T1,pyr = 41 s, and T1,lac = 19 s.

Results
and Discussion
Turnover of Hyperpolarized Pyruvate
The time evolution
of a series of 1D 13C spectra of hyperpolarized 13C1-pyruvate with 4T1 cancer cells injected into the NMR
flow cell is shown in Figure 2a (see Experimental Section). The 13C signal of pyruvate appears at 170.4 ppm, and the metabolic
product lactate is visible at 182.6 ppm. A further signal at 178.7
ppm corresponds to pyruvate hydrate, which is formed by a nonbiological
process. The observation of a strong lactate signal is expected for
cancer cells, where the glycolytic pathway is strongly favored even
in the presence of sufficient oxygen (Figure 2b).40 As a result
of the combined effects of reaction kinetics, T1 relaxation, and radio frequency pulses,41 the pyruvate signal shows a monoexponential decay, which
is paralleled by an initial increase of lactate signal. The integrated
lactate signal reaches its maximum after 20 s (Figure 2c). At that point, it is approximately 12.5
times lower than the initial signal of pyruvate. A lower signal of
the metabolic product is also expected because of the interplay of
the different rate constants affecting the signal. On the basis of
the quantitative modeling of the signal intensities (see Experimental Section), we determined that the rate
constant of the conversion from pyruvate to lactate is kpyr–lac = 6.5 · 10–3 s–1 under the given experimental conditions with ∼1
× 108 4T1 cancer cells, and the T1 relaxation times of pyruvate and lactate are T1,pyr = 41 s and T1,lac = 19 s. The T1 values match the values
reported for an in vitro experiment using T47D human breast cancer
cells (T1,pyr ≈ 45 s and T1,lac ≈ 19 s) performed under comparable
experimental conditions.42

Ultrafast D–T2 Maps
The
modified pulse sequence of the UF D–T2 experiment used in the present
work, shown in Figure 1, begins with a chemical shift selective π/2 pulse used for
the excitation of either the pyruvate or lactate signal. The spatial
encoding of diffusion data is based on an ultrafast pulsed-field gradient
spin echo (UF-PGSE) sequence, employing the spin–echoes created
by two successive adiabatic frequency-swept chirp π pulses.37 UF-PGSE part is followed by the CPMG loop for T2 relaxation, during which the magnetization
profile is read by using the principles of MRI.16 The experiment results in D–T2 data equivalent to a traditional measurement
in a single scan, with the experiment time of only 1.4 s (see Experimental Section).

Hyperpolarized UF D–T2 experiments were
carried out for pyruvate without cell suspension as well as pyruvate
and lactate in the 4T1 cell suspension by selectively exciting one
of the metabolite signals for 20 s after the sample injection. D–T2 maps resulting from
2D Laplace inversion of the measured data are shown in Figure 3. Hyperpolarized pyruvate without
cell suspension results in a single signal with T2 = (6.0 ± 2.0) s and D = (3.1 ±
0.8) · 10–9 m2/s (Figure 3a). This diffusion coefficient
is consistent with that obtained using a conventional PGSTE pulse
sequence on a stationary, nonhyperpolarized sample at T = 308 K, which yielded D = (2.2 ± 0.4) ·
10–9 m2/s (see Experimental
Section). The T2 is shortened compared
to values that would be obtained with a basic spin–echo pulse
sequence because of the use of magnetic field gradients for reading
the magnetization profile.15,16

Figure 3 Chemically selective
ultrafast D–T2 map of (a) pyruvate without cell suspension,
(b) pyruvate in cell suspension, and (c) lactate in cell suspension.
The D and T2 values shown
in the figures correspond to the maxima of the peaks. The uncertainties
are estimated from the width of the peaks. The dashed lines and white
error bars are results from the single exponential fits of the data
along the D or T2 directions
(see Figures S-7 and S-8 in Supporting Information).

In the presence of cell suspension,
the signal obtained with selective
excitation of the pyruvate-13C1 resonance yields
a D value of (2.3 ± 0.6) · 10–9 m2/s (Figure 3b). A D–T2 map acquired in a separate experiment with selective excitation
of the lactate resonance is shown in Figure 3c. The diffusion coefficient of lactate was
determined as (0.7 ± 0.2) · 10–9 m2/s. Two additional repetitions (Figure S-5), which were performed to assess reproducibility, resulted
in (0.7 ± 0.3) · 10–9 m2/s
and (1.0 ± 0.3) · 10–9 m2/s.
The obtained diffusion coefficient is three times lower than that
of pyruvate. Since pyruvate and lactate show similar diffusion coefficients
in aqueous solution alone44 (Dpyr = (1.12 ± 0.04)· 10–9 m2/s and Dlac = (1.00 ± 0.01)·
10–9 m2/s measured in 50 mM phosphate
buffer solution at 27 °C in a 14.1 T magnetic field), the observed
difference suggests that, here, the two signals stem from different
environments. Pyruvate is converted into lactate in the cytoplasm,
and therefore, the lower diffusion coefficient of lactate is explained
by restricted diffusion inside the cells due to increased viscosity,
compartmentalization, and interactions with macromolecules. At the
same time, this data indicates that lactate that has exported from
cells at the time of measurement does not significantly contribute
to the observed signal. Conversely, the primary pyruvate pool
in this experiment appears to be extracellular.

Diffusion coefficients
of lactate and pyruvate, Dlac and Dpyr, shown in Figure 3b,c, are consistent
with Dlac = (0.8 ± 0.2) · 10–9 m2/s and Dpyr = (1.7 ± 0.6) · 10–9 m2/s
values measured using a surface coil in an EL-4 murine lymphoma tumor
in vivo at 37 °C by Kettunen et al.45 They are also consistent with Dpyr =
(1.94 ± 0.07) · 10–9 m2/s and Dlac = (1.06 ± 0.15) · 10–9 m2/s measured in MCF-7 tumor cell spheroids in vitro
at 37 °C by Schilling et al.10 In
these reference values, the observed Dpyr is presumed to predominantly stem from an extracellular pool of
pyruvate and the observed Dlac predominantly
stems from an intracellular pool of lactate. Therefore, the comparison
confirms the reliability of the UF LNMR method.

In addition
to D, the observed T2 values are different in each case shown in Figure 3. While the reduced T2 in (b) would be expected because of the higher
viscosity of the sample compared to (a), which leads to longer rotational
correlation time, an increase in T2 in
(c) compared to (b) cannot be explained in this way. Another effect
that needs to be taken into consideration is a coupling between diffusion
and T2 relaxation measurement. A magnetic
field gradient at the time of signal acquisition increases the echo
attenuation due to molecular self-diffusion,46 leading to a shortened observed T2 value.
A calculation of this effect for the conditions observed in the lactate
and pyruvate signals is shown in Figure S-6. Irrespective of the origin of the observed changes in T2, this parameter takes a different value for each of
the species observed in Figure 3, thereby improving the contrast between the species.

The current ultrafast experiment employs a 90° selective pulse
to excite a metabolite peak of interest. Such selection may be advantageous
for spectra with multiple peaks, simplifying the identification of
peaks. We recorded also a data set without selective excitation. Although
both pyruvate and lactate signals were simultaneously excited in this
experiment, a resulting D–T2 map did not show multiple resolved signals. The ratio
of pyruvate to lactate signal intensity is ∼10, with the SNR
of 13C1-pyruvate ≈ 170. Such a SNR may
not be sufficient to resolve these two components with significantly
different intensities in D–T2 maps, as shown in a previous simulation.16 However, they can be resolved through chemical
shift selective excitation as demonstrated here. Since the contribution
of extracellular lactate signal and intracellular pyruvate signal
is small, these species were not observed in the D–T2 maps. In consequence, a single
intracellular lactate signal and a single extracellular pyruvate signal
was observed in each D–T2 map. Analysis of single D and T2 traces with single exponential fits, shown in Figure S-7, are further possible, because only
a single signal component is observed. This analysis results in D and T2 values, which are in
good agreement with the values obtained from the Laplace inversions
(see Figure 3). In
cases where the contribution of lactate signal and pyruvate signal
from the extra- and intracellular spaces is sufficient, two resolved
intra- and extracellular lactate (pyruvate) signals are expected on
a D–T2 map obtained
with selective excitation of the lactate (pyruvate) resonance in the
presence of cell suspension.

One benefit of using Laplace inversion
to determine diffusion is
that no prior knowledge of the value of the diffusion coefficient
or the number of components that are present is needed. To determine
the D value, the analysis initializes with a range
of D values, for instance [10–12, 10–7 m2/s], which corresponds to D of most molecules. After the initial analysis, the parameter
range can be narrowed. In addition, with sufficient signal-to-noise
ratio, the heterogeneity of a spin system can be resolved by showing
signals of diffusion coefficients and T2 relaxation for different components at different positions on a D–T2 map. In contrast,
typical analysis methods for signals showing multiexponential decay,
as they are encountered in diffusion NMR, first require the choice
of an adequate fitting model based on the known or assumed number
of components present.6,47−49

In the
UF LNMR D–T2 experiment,
spatial encoding results in the acquisition of
an entire data set in a single scan. Therefore, the acquisition time
can be reduced by several orders of magnitude compared to a conventional
measurement. Here, sensitivity is enhanced by the use of hyperpolarization.
This makes it possible to measure diffusion and T2 relaxation based on 13C signals of pyruvate
and lactate with concentrations as low as ∼10 and ∼1
mM, and within 1.4 s. The detection of 13C signal may have
more specificity than the 1H signals that would be acquired
without hyperpolarization, in particular, in complex samples containing
many metabolites.

The identification of intracellular metabolites
is of importance
for the interpretation of rate constants obtained from in vitro metabolic
studies using D-DNP hyperpolarization. Specifically, a potential application
of this method is the assessment of membrane permeability. Necrosis
of cancer cells due to the use of anticancer drugs can cause the cell
membrane to lose its selectivity. Molecules, which are normally transported
across the cell membrane by transmembrane proteins, are free
to diffuse in or out of the cells more rapidly. Schilling et
al.10 has reported a decreased ratio of Dpyr over Dlac, as
the fraction of dead cells increases during progressive membrane permeabilization.
This ratio can serve as a marker for monitoring the pathological changes
and treatment response in cancer. Second, it has been found that upregulation
of MCT is associated with malignancy of cancer cells.50 By measuring the change of intra- and extracellular proportion
of metabolites, such as lactate, as a function of time after the injection
of hyperpolarized precursor, such as pyruvate, transport rates can
be derived, which opens the way to assess the activity of MCTs.51

Similar pulse sequences may in the future
also be applicable in
an in vivo context, such as for the characterization of tumors. Spatial
encoding would in this case be realized over a homogeneous image region,
determined by a pilot image prior to the acquisition of the diffusion
data. The localization of lactate specifically may assist in the determination
of tumor aggressiveness, which is linked to lactate export.52

Conclusions
In summary, we have
described ultrafast D–T2 correlation LNMR as a tool to distinguish
intra- vs extracellular metabolites in the study of cellular
metabolism. This experiment simultaneously provides contrast in the
diffusion and T2 relaxation parameters,
therefore enhancing the ability to localize a metabolite. The correlation
map can be acquired in a single scan, resulting in a shorter experiment
time than for other diffusion measurements. The single scan nature
also renders the method inherently compatible with the use of nonrenewable
hyperpolarization to provide a large sensitivity enhancement. Using 13C hyperpolarization, we demonstrated the identification of
pools of lactate and pyruvate with significantly different self-diffusion
coefficients in cultures of mouse 4T1 breast cancer cells by this
method. The observed differences are consistent with an expected difference
in diffusion coefficients in the case of predominantly intracellular
and extracellular location of the two metabolites. For determining
diffusion by Laplace inversion, no prior knowledge of the value of
the diffusion coefficient or the number of components that are present
is required. Beyond the measurement of diffusion, the basic scheme
of hyperpolarized UF LNMR can further be adapted to investigate other
parameters for characterizing dynamic and exchange processes.
