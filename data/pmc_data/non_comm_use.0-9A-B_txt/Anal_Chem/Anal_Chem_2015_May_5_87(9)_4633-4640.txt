In this work, we evaluate the incorporation
of an ultralow flow
interface for coupling capillary electrophoresis (CE) and mass spectrometry
(MS), in combination with reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography
(HPLC) fractionation as an alternate workflow for quantitative proteomics.
Proteins, extracted from a SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino
acids in cell culture) labeled and an unlabeled yeast strain were
mixed and digested enzymatically in solution. The resulting peptides
were fractionated using RP-HPLC and analyzed by CE–MS yielding
a total of 28 538 quantified peptides that correspond to 3 272
quantified proteins. CE–MS analysis was performed using a neutral
capillary coating, providing the highest separation efficiency at
ultralow flow conditions (<10 nL/min). Moreover, we were able to
demonstrate that CE–MS is a powerful method for the identification
of low-abundance modified peptides within the same sample. Without
any further enrichment strategies, we succeeded in quantifying 1 371
phosphopeptides present in the CE–MS data set and found 49
phosphopeptides to be differentially regulated in the two yeast strains.
Including acetylation, phosphorylation, deamidation, and oxidized
forms, a total of 8 106 modified peptides could be identified
in addition to 33 854 unique peptide sequences found. The work
presented here shows the first quantitative proteomics approach that
combines SILAC labeling with CE–MS analysis.

==== Body
During the
past decade, quantitative
proteomics has become an indispensable tool in molecular biology and
medical science. This ongoing trend has been aided by a rapid development
of even faster and even more sensitive high-resolution mass spectrometers
enabling the identification and quantification of proteins to gain
insight into biological processes. The majority of workflows applied
in quantitative proteomics include the following elements: (i) labeling
of proteins or peptides, (ii) enzymatic cleavage of proteins into
peptides, (iii) separation of peptides prior to (iv) mass spectrometry
detection. The determination of relative protein level changes is
achieved by MS based sequencing of as many peptides as possible together
with intensity measurement of differentially labeled peptides in the
same analysis, which yields a sequence coverage of that specific protein
together with an abundance ratio between two or more biological samples.

Because of the large number of different proteins in a proteome
and the fact that all these proteins were cleaved into a large number
of peptides, a two-dimensional separation strategy is necessarily
incorporated in most proteomic workflows. For the first dimension
a growing range of methods is at the scientists disposal, including
offgel isoelectric focusing (IEF), sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and LC based strategies like ion exchange
chromatography, hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC), or
reversed-phase LC applying alkaline conditions.1−5 The dominant technique for separation in the second
dimension is reversed-phase HPLC using acidic conditions. This technique
offers quite a few benefits, the solvents used for separations are
highly compatible with subsequent MS analysis, separation conditions
can be adjusted according to the complexity of the sample and the
MS instrument scan speed, and the precolumn is an ideal tool for sample
preconcentration and cleanup. However, when using such complex samples,
HPLC systems are vulnerable to sample carry-over. The washing procedure
implemented to reduce this carry-over effect is often very time-consuming
and the elution gradient also yields inconsistent electrospray conditions
across the separation. Ultimately, the method is less suited for both,
hydrophilic peptides, which easily get lost during precolumn washing
and phosphopeptides, which can be suppressed because of coeluting
peptides.6,7

To overcome these problems, while
maintaining or even increasing
sensitivity, efforts have been ongoing to couple capillary electrophoresis
(CE) to mass spectrometry as CE offers inherent advantages, including
high separation efficiency and has proven to be an excellent technique
for the separation of modified proteins and peptides.8−15

Over the past 25 years, a variety of interfaces has been designed
to enable the CE–MS coupling. For a comprehensive description,
see reviews refs (16) and (17). Briefly,
interfaces, which operate using the sheath flow principle, achieve
ESI voltage contact via a constant flow of sheath liquid, either provided
electrokinetically or driven by pressure.18−20 A modification
is the so-called “liquid junction”, where sheath liquid
is added through a narrow gap between the separation capillary and
spray needle.21 These systems are working
very robust and allow for even the use of non MS compatible background
electrolytes (BGE) for CE separation, as they can be diluted to an
acceptable level with a MS compatible sheath liquid shortly before
transition to MS.18,22 The interface based on the electrokinetically
driven sheath liquid, developed by the group of Dovichi, has been
successfully applied in proteomics research.23,24 It was recently coupled to a microreactor for online protein digestion
and also used for coupling to a very fast scanning mass spectrometer
(Orbitrap Fusion).25,26 The first sheathless interface
was developed in the Smith lab in 1987 applying a steel needle in
which the terminus of the capillary was threaded.27 He and other groups (e.g., McLafferty,28 Bergquist29) also used conductive
materials to coat the emitter tips. Using this type of coupling, the
flow rate toward MS is influenced only by the electroosmotic flow
and is not affected by any sheath liquid. The sheathless interface
initially described by Moini et. al relies on a separation capillary
with a porous tip acting as nanospray emitter.30 It has been demonstrated that this interface is able to
work at flow rates down to less than 10 nL/min, which reduces ion
suppression and improves sensitivity.31−33 This CE–MS coupling
was evaluated successfully for use in peptide and protein analysis,
and it has been shown to be able to identify the localization of post-translational
modifications on antibodies and histones in a highly sensitive manner.6,34−38 Recently, a solid phase microextraction (SPME) column has also been
implemented prior to CE separation to enable comparable sample loads
to that possible with RP-HPLC.39

In this study we implemented for the first time, CE coupled to
mass spectrometry via the porous sprayer interface (CE–MS)
for the highly sensitive quantitative analysis of yeast proteomes.
Proteins were extracted from a SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino
acids in cell culture) labeled and an unlabeled strain, mixed and
digested enzymatically. The resulting peptides were fractionated using
RP-HPLC and analyzed by CE–MS using a neutral capillary coating.
Moreover, the CE–MS data set was mined for post-translationally
phosphorylated peptides and phosphorylation sites, and the ability
of the CE–MS approach to quantify these phosphorylations was
investigated in great detail. In this context, we searched also for
acetylated, deamidated, and oxidized peptides in the data set and
investigated their migration behavior in CE.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Yeast growth media was from SunriseScience
Products (CSM–His, −Arg, −Lys). 13C615N2-l-Lysine and Endoproteinase
Lys-C from Lysobacter enzymogenes were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(Vienna, Austria); 1,4 dithiothreitol was purchased from Biomol (Hamburg,
Germany), and iodoacetamide from GE Healthcare (Vienna, Austria).
All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Vienna, Austria).
Water was purified with a Milli-Q Academic water purification system
(Millipore, Vienna, Austria).

Cell Culture, Protein Extraction
The yeast strain used
was MBY4 (MATα leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 his3-200 trp1-901 lys2-801
suc2-9, vps4::TRP1).40 For all experiments,
isogenic yeast ESCRT mutants (vps4Δ, pRS413)
were compared to the corresponding wild type (WT) cells (vps4Δ, pRS413-VPS4). More details, also for the
subcellular fractionation can be found in the Supporting Information.

In-Solution Protein Digestion
For in-solution digestion,
cleared cell lysates (1.5 mg of extracted yeast proteins) were TCA-precipitated
and washed twice with acetone. The precipitated protein pellet was
resuspended in ammonium bicarbonate buffer (100 mM, pH 8.0). Proteins
were reduced with dithiothreitol (5 mM) at 56 °C for 30 min and
alkylated with iodoacetamide (18 mM) at room temperature for 20 min.
Proteins were digested overnight at 37 °C by adding Lys-C at
a ratio of 1:75 (protease/protein).

HPLC Fractionation of Peptides
Peptides resulting from
in-solution digestion were loaded on a Beckman Gold HPLC system (Beckman
Coulter, Brea, CA; dual pump model 125; UV–vis detector model
166) and separated by reversed-phase chromatography using an EC 250/4.6
Nucleosil 120-3 μm C18 column (Machery-Nagel, Düren,
Germany). At a constant flow rate of 500 μL/min, 1.4 mg of digested
yeast proteins were eluted within 2 h. Solvents for HPLC were 0.1%
trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in
85% acetonitrile (solvent B). The gradient started at 4% solvent B
for 14.5 min was increased to 60% solvent B in 90 min, up to 100%
B in 4 min, and was held at 100% B for 11.5 min. Fraction collection
was initiated with a time delay of 5 min after injection at 30 s intervals
for 80 min and at 1 min intervals for a further 22 min. A total of
182 fractions were collected, lyophilized, and stored dry at −20
°C. Prior to capillary electrophoresis, the peptides were dissolved
in 15 μL of ammonium acetate (50 mM, pH 4.0).

Capillary Electrophoresis
Peptide separation and ionization
was performed using a PA 800 plus capillary electrophoresis system
(Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) equipped with a 30 μm i.d capillary
with an integrated porous tip, serving both as separation capillary
and electrospray emitter, which was coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap XL
mass spectrometer. This “sheathless” CE interface consists
of a fused silica capillary (total length, 100 cm, i.d, 30 μm;
o.d., 150 μm) with a terminal 3 cm porous segment. The porous
segment is inserted into the prototype sprayer interface.6 A second capillary was used to fill the interface
with conductive liquid which in turn enabled electrical contact. A
neutral capillary (provided by Beckman Coulter) was used for the separation
and acetic acid 10% (v/v) was used as both, background electrolyte
(BGE) and conductive liquid for the emitter. Prior to capillary electrophoresis,
both the separation and the conductive liquid capillary were rinsed
to refresh the buffer. The sample was introduced by applying a pressure
of 5 psi for 50 s (40 nL injection volume) followed by a plug of BGE
(5 psi for 5 s). Capillary electrophoresis was conducted by applying
+30 kV with a simultaneous pressure of 1 psi for 60 min at the capillary
inlet. The flow rate was determined to be approximately 10 nL/min.

Mass Spectrometry
The LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer
was operating in data dependent mode to switch between MS and MS/MS
acquisition. Survey full scan MS spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap
with a resolution of R = 60 000 (at m/z = 400) in profile mode after accumulation
to an automated gain control (AGC) target value of 1 × 106 in the linear ion trap. MS/MS spectra were obtained in the
linear ion trap (LTQ) using collision induced dissociation (CID).
The six most intense precursors were sequentially selected for MS/MS
fragmentation.

Parameters applied for fragmentation were minimum
signal required 1000; isolation width (m/z) 2.0; activation time 30 ms; normalized collision energy
35.0; and activation Q of 0.250. MS/MS spectra were
acquired in centroid mode with an AGC target value of 1 × 104 and 100 ms maximum ionization time, respectively. Dynamic
exclusion was set to 15 s.

Data Analysis and Protein Quantification
Proteome Discoverer
version 1.4.0.288 (ThermoScientific) and MaxQuant version 1.3.0.5
were used for data analysis. Raw data obtained by CE–MS were
searched against a yeast ORF database downloaded from SGD Saccharomyces
Genome Database (www.yeastgenome.org; 6 627 entries,
last modified, February 3, 2011). Details can be found in the Supporting Information.

Results and Discussion
The primary objective of this investigation was to evaluate the
suitability of an ultralow flow capillary electrophoresis system interfaced
to mass spectrometry (CE–MS) for the use in SILAC based quantitative
proteomics with an additional focus on the analysis of protein modifications.
For this purpose, protein extracts of two isogenic yeast strains,
a heavy-lysine labeled wild-type and a nonlabeled mutant were mixed
1:1 and digested enzymatically in solution using Lys-C. The resulting
peptides were fractionated first by RP-HPLC and 182 fractions collected
(Figure 1). To avoid loss of hydrophilic peptides
that poorly interact with the RP material, the separation was initiated
with an isocratic elution at 3% acetonitrile followed by a gradient
elution ending at 85% acetonitrile. Total separation time was 120
min and high UV absorbance was observed between 30 and 90 min (11–43%
ACN) with highest absorbance between 55 and 70 (25–33% ACN).
For this reason it was assumed that these particular fractions would
exhibit the greatest number of different peptides. The peptide fractions
were then analyzed with a CE–MS setup utilizing a neutral capillary
coating for the separation. The sample volume introduced was 40 nL,
which corresponds to 5.6% of the total capillary volume. Taking into
account that peptides of the corresponding HPLC fractions were redissolved
in 15 μL of ammonium acetate and a minimum of 2 μL in
the tube was more than sufficient for injection, then theoretically
325 injections can be performed with an injection volume of 40 nL.
This approach comprising peptide preseparation by RP-HPLC followed
by CE–MS analysis is referred to as “CE–MS”
in the following text.

Figure 1 Proteomic workflow used to characterize SILAC labeled
yeast strains.
Protein extracts of two yeast strains, one heavy-lysine labeled and
one normal strain, were mixed. The protein extracts were digested
enzymatically, fractionated by RP-HPLC, and analyzed by capillary
electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry. This approach is referred
to as “CE–MS”.

Proteome of Yeast Analyzed by CE–MS
In order
to obtain the maximum information about the elution profile in LC
and the peptide migration behavior in CE, the approach was not optimized
with respect to obtain a maximum number of peptides within the shortest
possible time. Therefore, CE–MS analysis of all 182 fractions
collected with subsequent database search using Proteome Discoverer
software was performed and resulted in 33 656 identified peptides
(modified forms are not included). In total, 28 536 of these
peptides could be quantified, which corresponds to a quantification
rate of 84.8%. The remaining 5 120 peptides which were not
quantified, included 2 254 (44%) peptides having no lysine
in the sequence (837 C-terminal and 1 417 unspecifically cleaved
peptides), 1 124 (22%) peptides with a sequence not unique
to a protein and 1 742 (34%) peptides, which were not quantified
due to, e.g., too low signal intensity or overlapping peptide isotopic
distributions. A database search using Maxquant software resulted
in a lower number of identified peptides compared to the Proteome
Discoverer software; however, the number of quantified peptides was
roughly the same (see the Supporting Information Table S-1).

The highest number of peptides was observed in
fractions 55–150 (Figure 2A). A total
of 85.7% of all quantified peptides was found in these fractions.
The hydrophilic peptides in fractions 1–54 contribute to the
total number by 6.7%, particularly hydrophobic peptides in HPLC fractions
higher than 150 accounted for 7.5%.

Figure 2 (A) Distribution of yeast peptides quantified
in 182 HPLC fractions.
Peptides were preseparated by RP-HPLC and analyzed by CE–MS
using a neutral capillary coating. Peptides were marked in different
colors according to the number of fractions they were identified in.
Each peptide was counted only once in the particular HPLC fraction
where it showed the highest intensity. (B) The efficiency of the HPLC
separation is illustrated as a histogram showing how many quantified
peptides were found in only one, two, or more HPLC fractions.

Finally, we were able to identify
3 429 proteins with at
least 2 unique peptides and thereof 3 272 proteins were quantified
with at least 2 unique peptides and 2 peptide H/L ratios. The first
1 000 proteins were quantified by analyzing 10 fractions, whereas
30 and 80 fractions must be analyzed to dig deeper into the proteome
and to increase the number to 2 000 and 3 000, respectively
(Figure 3). This allows predicting the time
and fraction numbers necessary to achieve particular proteome coverage.

Figure 3 Number
of proteins quantified as a function of HPLC fractions analyzed
by CE–MS. The numbers lateral to the data points indicate the
HPLC fraction numbers, which were analyzed by CE–MS and combined
for database search.

When investigating the efficiency of the RP-HPLC separation
step,
we observed a high efficiency of separation in early and medium eluting
peptide fractions and a slightly reduced separation efficiency of
hydrophobic peptides in the later fractions. In total, 55.3% of all
peptides were quantified in one single fraction and 28.7% in two fractions
(Figure 2B), which indicates a very high separation
efficiency of the RP-HPLC analysis. Only 4.9% of peptides, mainly
hydrophobic once, were quantified in more than five fractions. The
majority of them were detected in one to three fractions with high
signal intensity but with low intensity in subsequent fractions, which
indicates peak tailing of high-abundance peptides.

The total
time necessary to analyze these 182 fractions was 215
h; the data acquisition time of the mass spectrometer was 182 h. It
should be noted in this context that the reanalyzation of fraction
no. 98 using a faster scanning MS instrument (Q Exactive, ThermoScientific)
resulted in twice as many identified (factor 2.01) and quantified
(factor 1.95) peptides (data not shown). This clearly indicates that
particularly CE–MS benefits from high scan rates due to the
fact that as a result of the high separation efficiency of the CE
mode, peptide peaks are very sharp and in this way total analysis
time can be significantly shortened.

We compared the proteins
identified with absolute cellular protein
abundances described in the literature and found that the CE–MS
approach was able to identify nearly all high-abundance proteins (>104 copies per cell) (Figure 4).41 Also a large number of the medium- and low-abundance
proteins (<104 copies per cell) were identified and
interestingly, CE–MS was able to identify even very low-abundance
proteins. However, it should be noted that a large number of proteins
(615 proteins) could not be allocated as no absolute protein abundances
were given in the literature. These results clearly indicate that
the CE–MS approach is a very powerful tool for the highly sensitive
protein identification. Because of the distinct separation mechanism,
RP-HPLC prefractionation and CE–MS analysis of peptides complement
each other.

Figure 4 Histogram illustrating the ability of CE–MS to identify
low-abundance proteins. Absolute abundances of 3 868 proteins
were taken from Ghaemmaghami et al.41 and compared to the proteins
identified by CE–MS. Proteins were included in this graph only
if they were identified by detection of at least 2 unique peptides.
A total of 615 proteins identified by CE–MS could not be allocated
due to missing absolute protein abundances in the literature.

A further increase in the number
of identified/quantified proteins
should be possible by, e.g., increasing the sample concentration or
by pretreatment of the sample with combinatorial peptide ligand libraries
(CPLL). In a comprehensive study applying the CPLL technology in combination
with nanoLC–MS, Di Girolamo et al. found an additional set
of 440 proteins in yeast which were not detected in the untreated
sample (total number of proteins found, 1785).42,43 When comparing his data with our results, it was evident that in
the untreated sample, 90% of the proteins were also found by the CE–MS
approach, however, in the case of the CPLL treated sample the overlap
was just 74%.

To determine differences in protein regulation
Significance B (Maxquant/Perseus
software), a P value depending on protein intensity and protein ratio
was used. As a result, 205 proteins were found to be regulated. When
only proteins were considered that change their levels at least by
±50%, 117 proteins remained.

Phosphopeptides
To investigate the impact of the introduced
mutation on the phosphorylation level of putative residues, additional
database searches of mass spectra were performed using three different
database search engines, Sequest and Mascot (implemented in Proteome
Discoverer) and Andromeda (part of MaxQuant software). In the CE–MS
data set a comparable number of phosphopeptides were found with all
three programs (Sequest, 1 584; Mascot, 1 599; Andromeda,
1 528), whereas, interestingly, the overlap differs significantly
(Supporting Information Figure S-1A). The
best match was observed using Mascot and Sequest with 1 360
overlapping peptides. In total, 1 483 phosphorylated peptides
(Supporting Information Figure S-1B), which
were identified by at least two programs, were then selected for further
investigations.

Detailed data analysis revealed the presence
of 1 274 mono-, 195 di-, and even 12 tri- and 2 tetra-phosphorylated
peptides (Figure 5); 1 371 peptides
could be quantified with peptide ratios ranging from 0.42 to 11.5
(Supporting Information Figure S-2). We
were able to assign 1 127 modification sites with an accuracy
of higher than 95% according to localization scores calculated with
Proteome Discoverer and MaxQuant Software.

Figure 5 Number of phosphopeptides
identified and quantified using the CE–MS
approach.

The number of phosphopeptides
identified by CE–MS is rather
high considering that no enrichment strategy was used and can be explained
by the fact that the ion suppression effects are minimized due to
the clear separation of phosphorylated peptides from their nonphosphorylated
forms and the really low flow conditions used (10 nL/min). It should
also be noted in this context that due to their reduced net charge,
phosphopeptides migrate significantly slower than most of the peptides
present in the fraction.

Using Significance B, a group of 50
peptides was found to be differently
abundant in heavy and light labeled yeast strains (Figure 6A). To calculate the actual change in phosphorylation
level the data were combined with the H/L ratios of the corresponding
proteins (Figure 6B) to compensate for changes
originating from differences in protein expression. As a final result,
49 candidates were found to be significantly up- or down-regulated.

Figure 6 (A) L/H
ratios of 50 phosphopeptides (dark blue bars) significantly
regulated on peptide level. An additional set of 15 insignificantly
regulated phosphopeptides are shown in light blue. (B) L/H ratios
of proteins corresponding to the phosphopeptides shown in part A.
(C) Change in the phosphorylation level calculated on the basis of
the phosphopeptide L/H ratio and the corresponding protein L/H ratio.
The change in the phosphorylation level of 16 peptides (light gray)
is not statistically significant.

As can be seen in Figure 6C, 16 phosphopeptides
are not significantly regulated anymore when their expression level
was corrected by the corresponding protein expression. On the other
hand, an additional set of 15 peptides (shown in light blue in Figure 6A) become now significantly regulated for the same
reason. These peptides would have been overlooked when dealing with
phosphopeptide enriched samples, where the corresponding protein expression
levels would not have been taken into account.

Additional Modifications
For the same reasons (charge
difference of modified forms and ultralow flow conditions) mentioned
earlier, we also investigated the presence of acetylated, deamidated,
and oxidized peptides in the CE–MS data set along with their
migration behavior in CE. Additional database searches revealed the
existence of 6 623 modified peptides (Figure 7). For example, a high number of peptides were found to be
deamidated on a single (3 860) or on two (403) asparagines.
Moreover, 900 proteins N-terminal peptides were found to be cotranslationally
acetylated and 153 peptides post-translationally acetylated on lysine
residues.

Figure 7 Modified peptides identified in the CE–MS data set of 182
analyzed HPLC fractions. Phosphopeptides are not included in this
chart.

The acetylation of both, the protein’s
N-terminal amino
group and the amino group of lysine residues lowers the net charge
of the corresponding peptides and results in a reduced electrophoretic
mobility. Therefore, most of these acetylated peptides appear at higher
migration times (>30 min), roughly at the same time where phosphopeptides
migrate (Figure 8).

Figure 8 Peptide migration time
depending on post-translational modifications.
Each dot represents the intensity and the particular time of quantification
of peptides that were detected by CE–MS in the HPLC fraction
no. 98. Black colored dots correspond to 688 nonmodified, green to
22 acetylated, and red to 57 phosphorylated peptides, respectively.

The separation of acetylated and
phosphorylated peptides away from
the multitude of nonmodified peptides, toward a region where only
few analytes migrate enables a high sensitive identification, even
of very low abundance peptides.

The deamidation of asparagine
via a succinimide intermediate with
subsequent hydrolyzation to aspartate and isoaspartate increases the
peptide mass by 0.984 Da.44 In addition
to that, the electrophoretic mobility of deamidated peptides is slightly
reduced, so that, for example, monodeamidated peptides migrate around
1.20 ( ± 1.08) min slower than their unmodified
counterparts (Figure 9). Interestingly, peptides
with a deamidated asparagine located at their N-terminus, deviate
remarkably from this pattern and exhibit even further increased migration
times of around 6.45 (±3.90) min. The reason for this effect
is not quite clear. However, it is probably caused by an interaction
of the carboxylic side chain of the aspartic/isoaspartic amino acid
with the N-terminal amino group resulting in the formation of a zwitterionic
structure reducing in this way the overall charge of the peptide.

Figure 9 Increase
in migration time of deamidated peptides compared to their
unmodified counterparts. Each dot represents a quantified peptide
with a single deamidated asparagine in its sequence that was observed
in the CE–MS data set. Peptides with the deamidated asparagine
at the N-terminal position showed a mean increase in migration time
of 6.45 (±3.90) min; all other peptides migrate 1.20 (±1.08)
min after the corresponding unmodified peptide.

Although deamidation reactions often occur during sample
preparation/storage
and contribute in this way significantly to the complexity of peptide
mixtures in bottom-up proteomics, it is very important to note in
this context that deamidation also occurs in vivo playing an important role in aging, autoimmune disorders (e.g.,
celiac disease), neurodegeneration (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease).45,46 Because of differences in the pKa values
of aspartic and iso-aspartic acid, the combination of CE and MS offers
a powerful tool for their discrete analysis superior to other techniques.
We recommend, in this case, the use of 0.1% formic acid as background
electrolyte to obtain an even further increase in selectivity, due
to the higher pH (2.7).

Conclusion
In this work, we have
presented a novel proteomic analysis strategy,
comprising peptide preseparation by RP-HPLC and ultralow flow CE–MS
analysis, for relative quantification of SILAC labeled yeast strains.

Without further enrichment strategies, a remarkable high number
of phosphopetides could be identified and quantified. Because of their
reduced net charge, phosphopeptides and also acetylated peptides shifts
significantly toward a low complexity region in the electropherogram
allowing a highly sensitive detection of these modified peptides and
the calculation of actual changes in modification levels using the
same data set.

Moreover, the novel approach offers other substantial
benefits:
(1) CE–MS is the method of choice for the separation and identification
of aspartic- and isoaspartic acid containing peptides for deamidation
studies. (2) The workload of the approach is strongly reduced due
to the single in-solution digestion step necessary. (3) RP-HPLC and
CE–MS analyses are fully automated. (4) The preseparation by
RP-HPLC ensured peptide fractions perfectly suited for subsequent
CE–MS analysis; no additional sample cleanup is necessary and
the risk of sample loss can be minimized. (5) Sample consumption in
CE–MS is about 40 nL; thus, the sample can effortlessly be
reanalyzed or stored for future use.
