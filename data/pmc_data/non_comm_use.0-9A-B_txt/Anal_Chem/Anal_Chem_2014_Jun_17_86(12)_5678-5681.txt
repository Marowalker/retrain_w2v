Protein–DNA binding interactions
play critical roles in
important cellular processes such as gene expression, cell division,
and chromosomal organization. Techniques to identify and characterize
these interactions often utilize formaldehyde cross-linking for stabilization
of the complexes. Advantages of formaldehyde as a cross-linking reagent
include cell permeability, relatively fast cross-linking kinetics,
and short cross-linker length. In addition, formaldehyde cross-links
are reversible, which has the advantage of allowing complexes to be
dissociated if desired but may also present a problem if undesired
dissociation occurs in the course of an experiment. While the kinetics
of formaldehyde cross-link formation have been well-established in
numerous studies, there have been no reports of the rate of cross-link
dissociation, even though it is clearly a critical variable when developing
a biochemical protocol involving formaldehyde cross-linking. We present
here a method for measurement of the rate of formaldehyde cross-link
reversal based upon the Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory
Elements (FAIRE) procedure and use it to determine the rate of cross-link
reversal for cross-linked protein–DNA complexes from yeast
cell lysate. The half-life of the protein–DNA cross-links varies
from 179 h at 4 °C to 11.3 h at 47 °C, with a rate that
increases exponentially with temperature and is independent of salt
concentration.

==== Body
Protein–DNA
interactions
are central to cellular function and vary widely with respect to parameters
such as their binding affinity, binding specificity, and biological
role. Histone proteins, for example, serve as structural DNA elements,
binding ubiquitously throughout the genome with little sequence-based
discrimination,1 while transcription factors,
another class of DNA-binding proteins, selectively bind to specific
DNA sequences within the genome where they help to control the expression
of target loci.2,3 A variety of tools have been developed
to characterize protein–DNA interactions in the cell including
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP),4 formaldehyde-assisted
isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE),5,6 proteomics
of isolated chromatin segments (PiCH),7 chromatin-affinity purification with mass spectrometry (ChAP-MS),8 and hybridization capture of chromatin associated
proteins for proteomics (HyCCAPP).9 These
technologies all utilize formaldehyde as a cross-linking reagent to
stabilize native protein–DNA complexes in the cell.

While
the kinetics of formaldehyde cross-link formation have been
well-established in numerous studies,4,10,11 there have been no reports of the rate of cross-link
dissociation, even though it is clearly a critical variable when developing
a biochemical protocol involving formaldehyde cross-linking. We present
here a method for measurement of the rate of formaldehyde cross-link
reversal based upon the FAIRE procedure and use it to determine the
rate of cross-link reversal for cross-linked protein–DNA complexes
from yeast cell lysate as a function of temperature and salt concentration.
The methodology and measured rates of cross-link reversal are useful
in the design of studies involving formaldehyde cross-linking.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y1788 was obtained from Professor David Mitchell (University
of Texas). Yeast extract peptone dextrose (Y1375, abbreviated YPD),
37% formaldehyde (F38775), phenol–chloroform–isoamyl
solution 25:24:1 (77617, abbreviated phenol–chloroform), and
protease inhibitors for fungal growth (P8215) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO). The 20% sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS) (161-0418) was purchased from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). The 10×
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (P0191), 5 M Tris pH = 8 (T5581),
1 M Tris pH = 7 (T1070), 5 M sodium chloride (NaCl) (S0250), and 500
mM tetraethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (E0307-06) were purchased
from Teknova (Hollister, CA). RNaseA (12091-039) was purchased from
Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). qPCR probes were ordered from Integrated
DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The 96-well plates (04729692001)
and Master Mix solutions (0470749001) for qPCR were purchased from
Roche USA (Nutley, NJ). Proteinase K (P8107S) was purchased from New
England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA).

Cell Lysate Preparation
Yeast cells were grown to saturation
in 5 mL of YPD overnight at 30 °C and shaken at 200 rpm in an
Amerex 747 shaker/incubator. The cells were diluted into 1.5 L of
YPD and grown to an OD600 ∼2.0 as measured using
an Agilent 8453 UV–vis spectrophotometer. Formaldehyde was
added to a final concentration just under 3% (122 mL) and incubated
for 30 min at room temperature, after which unreacted formaldehyde
was quenched with 250 mL of 5 M Tris. The cells were collected using
an Avanti J-25I centrifuge at 5 000g for 20
min. The cell pellet was washed once with 1× PBS and either used
right away or stored at −80 °C. Cells from 500 mL of culture
(∼2–3 mL cell pellet) were resuspended in 50 mL of lysis
buffer (20 mM EDTA, 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH7, and protease inhibitors
(1/200 from stock)). The cells were lysed at 30 kpsi using a Constant
Systems TS Series Cell Disruptor. SDS was added to the lysate solution
to a final concentration of 1% and the lysate was incubated at 65
°C for 5 min. The cross-linked chromatin was sonicated in 50
mL volumes using a MisoniX Ultrasonic Processor S4000 at 20 V for
a total of 3.5 min with alternating intervals of 4 s on and 4 s off.
The sample was then centrifuged at 8 000g for
12 min to separate the cellular debris from the soluble chromatin.
The supernatant was removed from the pellet and diluted 5-fold into
lysis buffer to decrease the total SDS concentration to 0.2%. RNaseA
was added to a final concentration of 60 μg/mL, and the solution
was shaken at 150 rpm at 37 °C for 60 min.

Phenol–Chloroform
Extraction to Purify Protein-Free DNA
Samples of cell lysate
(10 mL) were used for each formaldehyde
cross-linking reversal measurement. Aliquots (700 μL) were removed
from each sample prior to incubation to provide a reference sample
for determination of the total amount of DNA present (referred to
as input samples). Ten units of proteinase K were added to each of
these aliquots followed by overnight incubation at 37 °C in order
to degrade all proteins present and release the free DNA. The samples
were incubated at 4, 23, 37, or 47 °C, and three additional 700 μL
aliquots were removed at each time point (0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 h).
Phenol–chloroform (700 μL) was added to each aliquot
followed by vigorous vortexing for 30 s. The samples were centrifuged
at maximum speed (14 000g) for 5 min in a
Eppendorf 5417R centrifuge, after which the organic and aqueous layers
are completely separated. A volume of 500 μL of the aqueous
(upper) layer was removed and placed in a new eppendorf tube, followed
by addition of a second 500 μL portion of phenol–chloroform.
Vortexing and centrifugation were repeated, 200 μL of the aqueous
phase was removed, and 200 μL of the phenol–chloroform
was added and the vortexing/centrifugation steps were repeated for
a final time. A volume of 80 μL of the aqueous phase was removed
and diluted 10-fold into 1× TE (10 mM Tris pH = 7, 1 mM EDTA).
These samples were stored at −20 °C prior to qPCR analysis.
The input samples treated with proteinase K were subjected to the
same phenol–chloroform extraction procedure.

qPCR Analysis
DNA isolated from each sample was measured
using Taqman assays for each of the three genes studied (see the Supporting Information). Dilutions of purified
yeast genomic DNA were used for a standard curve. Each DNA sample
was analyzed in duplicate in a 96-well microtiter plate. Each well
contained 5 μL of sample, 10 μL of LightCycler 480 probe
master mix, 4.5 μL of water, and 0.5 μL of 40× primer
probe mix. After pipetting, each plate was centrifuged for 2 min at
2 000g. The samples were then analyzed using
a Roche 480 LightCycler. The qPCR runs included a 5 min preincubation
step at 95 °C, amplification cycles, and a 2 min cooling step
at 40 °C. Each amplification cycle was composed of a 10 s 95
°C incubation with a temperature ramp of 4.4 °C/s, a 30
s incubation at 60 °C with a temperature ramp of 2.2 °C/s,
and a third 1 s incubation at 72 °C with a temperature ramp of
4.4 °C/s. Detection of the FAM fluorophore was performed during
the 72 °C incubation using a 483–533 filter set. Analysis
of the resultant qPCR curves and calculation of Cp values were performed
using the Roche 480 LightCycler software and the second quant/2nd
derivative function. Absolute DNA amounts were calculated from the
genomic DNA standard curve, and % protein-free DNA values are given
by the ratio (protein-free DNA in aqueous phase/input DNA) ×
100%).

Results and Discussion
Measuring the Formaldehyde
Cross-Link Reversal Rate
Formaldehyde cross-link reversal
involves dissociation of the methylene
linkage between the protein and DNA moieties (Figure 1). The nature of these cross-links varies depending upon the
amino acid and nucleotides involved and the chemical landscape within
a cell subjected to formaldehyde is likely quite complex because of
the various linkages present. Lu et al. recently reported the cross-linked
species that result from addition of formaldehyde to mixtures of each
amino acid and nucleotide.12 They found
that cross-linking occurs between the amino acids cysteine (Cys),
histidine, tryptophan, and lysine (Lys) and the deoxynucleosides deoxyadenosine,
deoxycytosine, and/or deoxyguanosine (dG), with the predominant reaction
being that between Lys and dG to form an aminal linkage, and the second
most prominent reaction being that between Cys and dG to form a hemiaminal
thioether linkage.12 A detailed reaction
mechanism for the prototypic Lys–dG coupling reaction is shown
in Figure 1. In the present work, we determine
the aggregate cross-link reversal rate of formaldehyde protein–DNA
complexes isolated from cross-linked yeast cells, which are likely
to reflect the predominant Lys-dG and Cys-dG cross-links as well as
small contributions from the other amino acid-deoxynucleoside pairs.

Figure 1 Formaldehyde
protein–DNA cross-link/reversal mechanism between
Lys and dG. All steps in the reaction mechanism are reversible. Lysine-containing
proteins (R1) initially attack the electrophilic carbon
of formaldehyde. After loss of water, the resultant Schiff base is
susceptible to nucleophilic attack by the exocyclic amine of deoxyguanosine
residues (R2) to form an aminal linkage between protein
(R1) and DNA (R2) components. Both the cross-linking
and cross-link reversal steps are demarcated by the rectangle.

In general, to measure the rate
of cross-link reversal, either
the disappearance of reactants or the appearance of products must
be measured. In the case of formaldehyde cross-links, this means the
disappearance of protein–DNA complexes or the appearance of
native protein and DNA moieties without the methylene linkages. Many
methods exist to measure total DNA or protein levels including PicoGreen
binding13 for the former and BCA14 and A26015 assays
for the latter. In the complex background of cell lysate, however,
the disappearance of a single methylene bridge is not a substantial
perturbation and these assays do not distinguish between cross-linked
and non-cross-linked species. Therefore, an additional purification
step is useful to isolate one component of the reaction and allow
for specific analysis.

FAIRE was developed as a method to identify
protein-free regions
of the genome.6 The assay uses phenol–chloroform
extraction as a means to separate protein-free DNA fragments from
cross-linked protein–DNA complexes and free protein. When subjected
to phenol–chloroform extraction, proteins partition into the
organic phase, while DNA remains in the aqueous phase. Protein–DNA
complexes reside at the interface between the two phases. Identification
of the DNA sequences found in the aqueous phase, the protein-free
fraction, reveals those sequences in the genome that are not associated
with protein, thereby providing a means of determining protein occupancy
across the genome. We utilized FAIRE to determine the kinetics of
cross-link reversal for formaldehyde-cross-linked protein–DNA
complexes from yeast. Cross-linked cells were lysed, sonicated, and
centrifuged, to shear the DNA and clear the lysate sample of debris.
Aliquots of the lysate sample were then periodically subjected to
phenol–chloroform extraction to isolate the protein-free DNA
fraction of the lysate. The aqueous material was then interrogated
using qPCR assays specific for three genes (INO1,
X-element, and 25S rDNA) to measure the relative amounts of DNA corresponding
to each gene present as a function of time. The DNA levels present
in the aqueous phase of the phenol–chloroform extraction were
plotted as a function of time and the cross-link reversal rate corresponds
to the slope of the line (Figure 2). As very
similar results were obtained for all three genes, the results for
all three genes were averaged to provide an overall measure of cross-link
reversal rate.

Figure 2 Temperature dependence of the cross-link reversal rate.
The percentage
of protein-free DNA measured by qPCR is plotted versus time for samples
at four different temperatures: 4, 23, 37, and 47 °C (A). Each
point is the average qPCR signal for the three different genes INO1, X-element, and 25S rDNA. The error bars are the standard
deviation of qPCR signals. A best fit linear regression is shown for
each temperature trace. The slope of each line was determined and
plotted in panel B as a function of temperature (°C). These values
represent the reverse cross-linking rate. The rate of reverse cross-linking
as a function of temperature was fit to an exponential.

Temperature Effects
It is well-known
that heat reverses
formaldehyde cross-links;16 however, the
rates have not been measured nor has the dependence of the rate on
temperature. We measured the cross-link reversal rate at four different
temperatures: 4, 23, 37, and 47 °C. The first three temperatures
were selected as they correspond to commonly employed temperatures
in biochemical protocols, and the 47 °C temperature was chosen
arbitrarily as a more extreme case (dissociation rates at other temperatures
may be estimated if desired from the exponential fit to the data shown
in Figure 2B). The percent of protein-free
DNA relative to total input DNA is plotted versus time for each of
the four temperatures examined (Figure 2A).
The slope of each line is given in Table 1 as
the reaction rate. As expected, the reaction rate increases with temperature,
with the slowest reaction rate at the lowest temperature measured
(0.3% protein-free DNA/h at 4 °C) and the fastest reaction rate
at the highest temperature measured (4.4% protein-free DNA/h at 47
°C). Half-lives were also calculated for each temperature assuming
a zero-order rate law for a unimolecular dissociation. The longest
half-life was 179 h, at 4 °C, while the shortest half-life was
11.3 h, at 47 °C.

a For each temperature
studied,
the reaction rate and half-life (t1/2)
are listed.

The temperature
dependence of the cross-link reversal rate fits
well to an exponential function, as shown in Figure 2B. On the basis of this dependence, we were able to fit the
data to both the linear Arrhenius eq 1 and Eyring
eq 2. 1   2  From
the Arrhenius plot, the activation energy
(Ea) was determined to be 47 kJ mol–1, while from the Eyring plot, the enthalpy of activation
(ΔH⧧) and entropy of activation
(ΔS⧧) were determined to
be 44 kJ mol–1 and −0.1 kJ mol–1 K–1, respectively.

Conclusion
We
show here the use of FAIRE-qPCR to directly measure the rate
of formaldehyde cross-link reversal for protein–DNA complexes.
Formaldehyde cross-links are shown to depend exponentially on temperature,
with half-lives varying from 11.3 h at 4 °C to 179 h at 47 °C.
Characterization of the cross-link reversal rate is useful for experiments
that utilize formaldehyde to stabilize protein–DNA interactions.
