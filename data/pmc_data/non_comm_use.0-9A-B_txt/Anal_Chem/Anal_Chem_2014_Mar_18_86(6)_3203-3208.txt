The visual selection of specific
cells within an ex vivo brain slice, combined with
whole-cell patch clamp recording and
capillary electrophoresis (CE)–mass spectrometry (MS)-based
metabolomics, yields high chemical information on the selected cells.
By providing access to a cell’s intracellular environment,
the whole-cell patch clamp technique allows one to record the cell’s
physiological activity. A patch clamp pipet is used to withdraw ∼3
pL of cytoplasm for metabolomic analysis using CE–MS. Sampling
the cytoplasm, rather than an intact isolated neuron, ensures that
the sample arises from the cell of interest and that structures such
as presynaptic terminals from surrounding, nontargeted neurons are
not sampled. We sampled the rat thalamus, a well-defined system containing
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic and glutamatergic neurons. The
approach was validated by recording and sampling from glutamatergic
thalamocortical neurons, which receive major synaptic input from GABAergic
thalamic reticular nucleus neurons, as well as neurons and astrocytes
from the ventral basal nucleus and the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus.
From the analysis of the cytoplasm of glutamatergic cells, approximately
60 metabolites were detected, none of which corresponded to the compound
GABA. However, GABA was successfully detected when sampling the cytoplasm
of GABAergic neurons, demonstrating the exclusive nature of our cytoplasmic
sampling approach. The combination of whole-cell patch clamp with
single cell cytoplasm metabolomics provides the ability to link the
physiological activity of neurons and astrocytes with their neurochemical
state. The observed differences in the metabolome of these neurons
underscore the striking cell to cell heterogeneity in the brain.

==== Body
Capillary
electrophoresis (CE)
offers the ability to separate a wide range of biomolecules from a
variety of samples with outstanding success, including volume-limited
samples such as individual organelles and single cells.1−5 One benefit of the capacity to interrogate small volumes is the
ability to characterize the cell to cell differences from a heterogeneous
cell population.6,7 As we show here, the sensitivity
of CE when hyphenated to mass spectrometry (MS) enables the detection
of a range of metabolites from single mammalian neurons.

CE
has been combined with patch clamp recording as a form of sampling
to introduce specific compounds to the patched cell.8−13 In these prior studies, the ion channel agonists were separated
by CE with the capillary outlet positioned to release the compounds
over a patch-clamped cell to detect physiological responses. The current
work appears to be the first report of a metabolomic analysis of specific
cells from a brain slice using patch clamp as a sampling method. More
specifically, we used the patch clamp to sample from the cytoplasm
and perform a small-volume assay using CE–MS.

Of the
“omics” approaches, single cell transcriptomics
has routinely been combined with electrophysiological sampling,14−18 whereas single cell metabolomics measurements are less common. Even
though single cell and subcellular sampling with direct MS has been
used, more complete metabolomics coverage is obtained by incorporating
a separation step before performing the mass spectrometric analysis.19−23 We have developed a range of single cell metabolomics approaches
using CE–MS.24−27 While most of these prior studies have been with larger invertebrate
neurons, CE–MS is adaptable to a wide range of smaller cell
types. For many models and cell types, it can be difficult to select
specific cells. Here we use a visualized whole-cell patch clamp approach
to select specific cells, characterize their physiological properties,
and sample a small volume of an individual cell’s cytoplasm
for subsequent analysis with CE–MS. This approach offers unmatched
information on cell function and neurochemical content.

Experimental
Section
Thalamic Slice Preparation
Experimental procedures
were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health
Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved
by the University of Illinois Animal Care and Use Committee. Thalamic
slices were prepared from Sprague–Dawley rats (Harlan Laboratories,
Inc., Indianapolis, IN) of either sex (postnatal age, 14–17
days) as previously described.28−30 Rats were deeply anesthetized
with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) and decapitated. Brains were
quickly removed and immediately transferred into a cold (4 °C),
oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) slicing solution
containing (in mM): 2.5 KCl, 26 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 10.0 MgCl2, 2.0 CaCl2, 234.0
sucrose, and 11.0 glucose. Using a vibrating tissue slicer, thalamic
slices (275–300-μm thick) were cut on a horizontal plane
to access the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and ventral basal (VB)
nucleus and on the coronal plane for the dorsal lateral geniculate
nucleus (dLGN); astrocyte samples were prepared from slices taken
from both planes. Tissue slices were transferred into a holding chamber
containing oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) artificial
cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), which consisted of (in mM): 126.0 NaCl,
26.0 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2.0 MgCl2, 2.0 CaCl2, and 10.0 glucose. The
tissue was incubated at 32 °C for approximately 20 min and then
cooled to 21 °C.

Whole Cell Recording Procedures
Individual slices were
transferred to a recording chamber (∼1.5 mL volume) that was
maintained at 32 °C with oxygenated aCSF and recirculated at
2.5–3 mL/min. Individual neurons were visualized using a fixed-stage
microscope (Olympus BX-51WI; Olympus America Inc., Center Valley,
PA) equipped with Dodt contrast optics (Prairie Technologies, Middleton,
WI) and a water-immersion objective (60× ; LUMPlan FL N, FN26.5,
Olympus). The patch pipets had a tip resistance of 3–6 MΩ
(∼2 μm-diameter tip) when filled with the following solution
(in mM): 117.0 K-gluconate, 13.0 KCl, 1.0 MgCl2, 0.07 CaCl2, 0.1 EGTA, 10.0 HEPES, 2.0 Na2-ATP, and 0.4 Na-GTP
(pH 7.3, 290 mOsm). Initial experiments used an intracellular solution
containing (in mM): 117.0 potassium gluconate, 13.0 KCl, 1.0 MgCl2, 0.07 CaCl2, 0.5 EGTA, 10.0 HEPES, 2.0 Na2-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, and 5.0 phosphocreatine, but it was found
that the phosphocreatine was abundant enough to produce ionization
suppression effects for the remainder of the CE–MS run and
so was not used in later experiments.

In a subpopulation of
recordings, Alexa Fluor 594 fluorescent dye (50 μM) (Life Technologies,
Grand Island, NY) was included in the recording pipet to allow for
more detailed morphological identification of the recorded cell using
fluorescence microscopy. The pipet solution resulted in a junction
potential of 10 mV and was corrected for all voltage recordings. During
recording, the pipet capacitance was neutralized and the access resistance
continually monitored. The electrophysiology data was acquired using
an Axon MultiClamp 700A amplifier (Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale,
CA), filtered at 2–3 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz using an
Axon Digidata 1440A digitizer, in combination with pCLAMP 10 software.
Images of fluorescent labeled neurons were collected as a z-stack
using two-photon laser scanning miscroscopy (Prairie Technologies/Bruker,
Middleton, WI).

Collecting Intracellular Material
Once whole cell configuration
was established, a series of current steps were applied (−200
to 200 pA, 40 pA steps, 800 ms duration) to characterize the intrinsic
membrane properties of the cell, such as resting membrane potential,
apparent input resistance, and action potential characteristics. Intracellular
contents were removed from the recorded neuron by applying negative
pressure, via mouth pipetting or a manometer, to the recording pipet
while simultaneously recording the neuron’s physiology and
visualizing the cell using Dodt contrast (Figure 1). Only cells whose seals were held tightly (>1 GΩ)
and membranes were not ruptured were collected for analysis as cytoplasm
samples, ensuring that only intracellular material was collected and
analyzed. If the membrane ruptured during the application of negative
pressure, the samples were sometimes analyzed as control samples as
they contained extracellular contamination. Once a sufficient amount
of material was withdrawn from the cell, the patch pipet was quickly
removed from the slice and ∼1 mm of the distal tip broken off
(Figure 2) against the bottom of a 0.2 mL thin-walled
PCR tube (USA Scientific, Inc., Ocala, CA). A metabolite extraction
solution (250 nL) composed of 50% methanol and 0.5% acetic acid (v/v)
was then added to the tube. Sample tubes were placed on dry ice until
sample collection was completed for the day and then stored at −80
°C until analysis with CE–MS. The volume of cytoplasm
withdrawn was estimated by taking images of the Alexafluor-injected
neuron before and after applying negative pressure to the patch pipet
and then using ImageJ to measure the length and width of the cell
body and calculating the volume of the cell (assuming an ellipsoid)
before and after withdrawing the cytoplasm. The difference in volumes
was the amount withdrawn into the pipet.

Figure 1 Schema illustrating the
workflow for sample collection. An upright
microscope is used for conducting electrophysiology experiments under
video observation. Following the process of establishing the whole-cell
configuration as described in the text, negative pressure is applied
to the patch pipet and the cytoplasm is withdrawn. The patch pipet
is removed and the tip broken off into the bottom of a PCR tube. Extraction
solution is then added to the tube and the sample centrifuged and
placed on dry ice until analysis by CE–MS.

CE–MS
CE–MS
was performed as reported
previously31 using either a micrOTOF or
a maXis 4G Qq-ToF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica,
MA) operated in positive ion mode. The current procedure differed
from our prior work in that we used a capillary length of 65–70
cm, a separation potential of 14–16 kV, and a sample injection
volume of ∼28 nL. Over 100 distinct molecular features were
detected from the cytoplasm samples, among which 70 metabolite identities
were assigned with high confidence through spiking with standards,
migration order agreement, and matching of tandem mass spectral data
from the endogenous substances with those of chemical standards when
available and with fragmentation profiles found at publicly available
mass spectral databases (Metlin32 and HMDB33). A signal-to-noise ratio of 3 was used as the
threshold of detection for an analyte while using an isolation width
of ±10 mDa; the migration time also had to match the standard
within the typical variation in migration times for other compounds
within each CE run.

Results and Discussion
Sample selection
is especially important for this work as we are
validating a new measurement platform and so we need information on
the expected transmitters and details on cellular heterogeneity. The
thalamus, a centrally located brain structure that provides a major
extrinsic input to the neocortex,34 has
been shown to play a central role in behavioral state transitions
(e.g., the sleep/wake cycle), sensory processing, and certain types
of epilepsy.35,36 Like many brain areas, the thalamus
contains populations of both excitatory glutamatergic neurons (located
in the dorsal thalamus) as well as inhibitory GABAergic neurons (the
major cell type in the TRN).34,37 Before moving to single
cell samples, we examined larger samples of adjacent thalamic nuclei
from a 280-μm-thick section (Figure 3), which were microdissected, placed in 2.5 μL of the extraction
solution, and analyzed by CE–MS. Even adjacent nuclei showed
striking differences in the abundance and presence of different neurotransmitters.
The heterogeneity observed in two distinct thalamic nuclei, which
have been shown to only use the neurotransmitters GABA and glutamate,
prompted us to determine the more precise localization of the cell
to cell signaling within these areas.

Figure 3 Microdissected thalamic nuclei from adjacent
regions of a 280-μm-thick
section produce dramatically different neurotransmitter profiles when
analyzed by CE–MS. The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) contains
purely GABAergic neurons, but the slice provides sufficient amounts
of acetylcholine and glutamate in addition to GABA for MS detection.
The dorsal thalamus (DT) contains predominantly glutamatergic neurons
(such as those of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, which were
patched in this study) but the slice contains abundant amounts of
histamine, acetylcholine, GABA, serotonin, norepinephrine, as well
as the nitric oxide precursor, argininosuccinate. Additional metabolites
from these slices are listed in Table S2 in the Supporting Information.

As illustrated in Figure 1, when working
with individual cells rather than brain sections, the workflow involved
standard whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology recordings, where
a selected cell was patched.28−30 Within a specific region of the
thalamic slice, a cell was carefully approached while applying positive
pressure. When the glass pipet tip (Figure 2) was in contact with the cell membrane, negative pressure was applied
to form a tight GΩ seal. Whole-cell configuration was established
by applying additional negative pressure to puncture a passageway
into the cell membrane. In order to characterize the intrinsic properties
from the sampled cell, the current protocol described above was applied.
Once a stable patch was confirmed (after 2–30 min when dye
injection was used for imaging), the intracellular material was collected
by applying additional negative pressure after the electrical recordings
to withdraw a small volume of the cell contents into the pipet. A
small section of the pipet was then broken off into the sample vial
(Figure 1) and later measured with CE–MS.

The cytoplasm of individual neurons contained varying amounts of
metabolites, several of which were detected in a cell-type specific
manner (e.g., GABA, histamine). Samples for control experiments were
produced by (1) breaking the patch pipet tip into PCR tubes following
filling of the pipet with intracellular recording solution; (2) penetrating
the tissue and approaching the cell without patching; (3) penetrating
the tissue and approaching the cell and applying negative pressure
to draw extracellular fluid into the patch pipet; and (4) patching
a cell and performing a current injection and pulling the pipet off
of the cell, taking care not to apply negative pressure before pulling
the pipet off. In these control experiments, we detected several low
signals corresponding to amino acids, even without patching onto a
cell (from the extracellular media). One of our primary focuses was
on the transmitter GABA; none was detected from the control samples
or from the cytoplasm of glutamatergic neurons.

Figure 4 shows representative electrophysiological
traces (column A), photomicrographs (column B), and the corresponding
ion electropherograms for three different neurons as well as an astrocyte
(column C). Table S1 in the Supporting Information compares the number of detected metabolites from microdissected
nuclei versus cytoplasm across the different cell types analyzed in
these experiments. The neurotransmitter GABA (light red peak in Figure 4C2,C3) was detected in cytoplasm from two electrophysiologically
distinct types of TRN neurons (the burst firing and the nonburst firing);
overall, it was detected in 11 of 14 of the TRN neurons, one of four
astrocyte samples, and the single dLGN interneuron sampled. It was
never detected in VB neurons (n = 5) or in dLGN relay
neurons (n = 6) (Figure 4C1).
Further studies are needed to determine if there is a distinct population
of GABA-negative cells in the TRN. Glutamate (light blue peak in Figure 4C) was detected in 28 of 30 samples (the two samples
in which glutamate was not detected had issues during CE separation
and so the separation was stopped before glutamate would have been
detected).

Figure 4 Data obtained from four distinct cell types: (1) VB thalamocortical
neuron; (2) nonburst firing TRN neuron; (3) bursting TRN neuron; (4)
astrocyte. (A) Electrophysiological recordings of the individual cells
(1–4) shown in the (B) photomicrographs (scale bar = 20 μm).
(C) Extracted ion chromatograms corresponding to the cytoplasm sampled
from the neurons and glia are shown. Peaks correspond to ornithine
(dark red), GABA (light red), glycine (yellow), serine (gold), tryptophan
(rainbow), glutamine (light green), glutamate (light blue), tyrosine
(dark blue), and proline (indigo).

The whole-cell patch-clamp technique has long been used to
assay
the electrophysiology of individual neurons in acute in vitro thalamic slice preparations. Here we take advantage of the patch
pipet to withdraw picoliter volumes of cytoplasm from the identified
neurons to explore their metabolome. Across all cell types, amino
acids such as ornithine (dark red peak, Figure 4C), arginine, glutamate (light blue peak, Figure 4C), tyrosine (dark blue peak, Figure 4C), phenylalanine, histidine, serine (gold peak, Figure 4C), and proline (indigo peak, Figure 4C) were detected in >50% of all cells. Other molecules
such
as the polyamines spermine and spermidine, adenine, glutathione, and
nucleotides such as adenosine were also frequently detected (30–80%).
Some metabolites, such as the amino acids asparagine and citrulline
(related to NO production via nitric oxide synthase), and the neurotransmitters
histamine and GABA (light red peak Figure 4C), were detected in less than half of the cells or only in specific
cell types such as TRN neurons and dLGN interneurons. Table S2 in
the Supporting Information lists all of
the identified metabolites and their frequency of detection across
all cell types.

In our previous CE–MS measurements24,31 and MALDI MS measurements21,38,39 from individual cells, we detected multiple cellular metabolites;
however, these studies characterized all compounds in the isolated
samples, including the compounds present in an isolated cell and also
those present in structures that remained attached to the cell, such
as nerve and glia terminals from other cells. Although the volume
of these attached structures may be small, some metabolites such as
transmitters may be present in high concentrations and, thus, will
be detected. Our patch clamp sampling should minimize such confounding
factors as we are sampling the internal cytoplasm of the selected
cell. In our prior work (as well as in many unpublished measurements),
GABA was detected in samples of individual invertebrate neurons,25 which were not expected to be GABAergic based
on an earlier report using immunohistochemistry.40 Here our results agree with prior immunocytochemistry localization
determined using the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase37 as well as GABA-like immunoreactivity in the
TRN,41 validating the fidelity of our sampling
approach.

In summary, the ability to combine patch clamp electrophysiology
with CE–MS offers a potential new measurement tool for characterizing
cell to cell heterogeneity in well-defined cell samples. The approach
is well suited for examining cell types other than neurons, such as
astrocytes,42 and provides quantitative
information relating neuronal activity to changes in the cellular
metabolome within a physiologically relevant context.
