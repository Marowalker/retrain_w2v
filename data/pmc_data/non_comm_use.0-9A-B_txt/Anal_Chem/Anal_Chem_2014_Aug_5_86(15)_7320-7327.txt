Structure
elucidation of biological compounds is still a major
bottleneck of untargeted LC-HRMS approaches in metabolomics research.
The aim of the present study was to combine stable isotope labeling
and tandem mass spectrometry for the automated interpretation of the
elemental composition of fragment ions and thereby facilitate the
structural characterization of metabolites. The software tool FragExtract
was developed and evaluated with LC-HRMS/MS spectra of both native 12C- and uniformly 13C (U-13C)-labeled
analytical standards of 10 fungal substances in pure solvent and spiked
into fungal culture filtrate of Fusarium graminearum respectively. Furthermore, the developed approach is exemplified
with nine unknown biochemical compounds contained in F. graminearum samples derived from an untargeted
metabolomics experiment. The mass difference between the corresponding
fragment ions present in the MS/MS spectra of the native and U-13C-labeled compound enabled the assignment of the number of
carbon atoms to each fragment signal and allowed the generation of
meaningful putative molecular formulas for each fragment ion, which
in turn also helped determine the elemental composition of the precursor
ion. Compared to laborious manual analysis of the MS/MS spectra, the
presented algorithm marks an important step toward efficient fragment
signal elucidation and structure annotation of metabolites in future
untargeted metabolomics studies. Moreover, as demonstrated for a fungal
culture sample, FragExtract also assists the characterization of unknown
metabolites, which are not contained in databases, and thus exhibits
a significant contribution to untargeted metabolomics research.

==== Body
The combination
of electrospray
ionization (ESI)–liquid chromatography (LC)–high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) offers the potential to measure hundreds
to thousands of metabolites contained in complex biological samples
in a single analytical run.1 Although LC-HRMS(/MS)
also enables the generation of structure-related information for the
measured substances, the unambiguous elucidation of the elemental
composition and detailed chemical structure of unknown metabolites
remains one of the most challenging tasks in untargeted metabolomics
studies.

In LC-HRMS-based techniques, compound annotation usually
starts
with the prediction of molecular formulas and matching accurately
measured masses against comprehensive databases such as AntiBase2 in the case of microbial metabolites, chemical
substance databases such as ChEBI3 or PubChem,4 or metabolite pathway databases such as KEGG5 or MetaCyc.6 Unfortunately,
as a result of the limited resolving power and mass accuracy of MS
instruments, the knowledge of a metabolite’s accurate mass
is generally not sufficient to determine its elemental composition
unambiguously.7,8 To reduce the number of potential
molecular formulas and to eventually determine a metabolite’s
molecular formula, chemical logics in combination with heuristic rules
may be used9 as well as the annotation
of heteroatoms (e.g., S, Fe, Cl) from isotopic fine structures.10−12

Usually many structural isomers may correspond to a single
molecular
formula, which further complicates the detailed elucidation of chemical
structures. Consequently, definitive metabolite identification by
LC-HRMS can only be achieved by comparing two or more orthogonal properties
such as retention time and accurate mass with those obtained for an
authentic standard under identical measurement conditions.13 Because in many cases, however, authentic compounds
are not available, different strategies for the interpretation and
annotation of product ion spectra have been suggested. The most common
approach, if no authentic standard compound is available, is to try
to putatively identify a compound by comparing the measured MS/MS
fragments against spectra of tandem MS databases that are publicly
available. For this purpose MassBank14 (http://www.massbank.jp), METLIN15 (http://metlin.scripps.edu/), or NIST MS/MS16 database can be used, for example. This approach
can further benefit from prior data processing steps for deconvolution
of recorded product ion spectra, as has been described recently.17 A major limitation of compound annotation by
MS/MS spectrum matching consists in the size and content of the respective
databases, because many compound (classes) may not be contained, and
often only sparse information on the biological context of the metabolites
is available.13

Alternatively, different
computationally assisted techniques have
been described to annotate metabolites of interest. Several software
tools have been developed which try to generate in silico fragment
spectra on the basis of different rule sets18 or combinatorial approaches19 and compare
the predicted fragments to the measured product ion spectra. In addition,
very recently, fragmentation-tree-based approaches have been described.20,21 These methods construct hierarchical mass spectral trees, in which
measured fragments or their molecular formulas become traceable to
the precursor mass or its elemental composition.22 These approaches can further be used to automatically detect
similarities between the generated fragmentation trees.23

Complementary to these “classical”
approaches, stable
isotope-assisted techniques, with 13C, 34S,
or 15N being the most frequently used, are becoming increasingly
popular, because they offer powerful tools to conquer major challenges
of untargeted metabolomics studies.7,11 The general
concepts and applications of stable istotope labeling (SIL)-assisted
approaches for improved global feature detection, tracer metabolization,
more accurate comparative quantitation, and metabolite annotation24−27 have been summarized in several recent review articles.7,28,30,39 Typically, isotope-enriched metabolites or globally labeled biological
samples are mixed with their native analogues prior to LC-HRMS measurements
and the resulting labeling-specific mass spectral patterns are systematically
used for data analysis. Although sophisticated algorithms and software
tools have already been developed to automatically recognize labeling-specific
isotopic patterns in GC-MS31 and LC-HRMS
full scan data,28,29,32−34 to the best of the authors’ knowledge, no
processing tool for the automated annotation of labeling-specific
LC-HRMS/MS spectra has been published until today.

Here, we
present FragExtract, a novel algorithm that resulted in
a software tool, which allows the efficient filtering and unbiased
assignment of MS/MS fragment signals including the correct number
of carbon atoms derived from SIL-assisted metabolomics experiments.
The presented approach ultimately performs a spectral clean up by
extracting relevant MS/MS fragments based on pairs of corresponding
native (i.e., 12C) and labeled (i.e., 13C) ions.
Moreover, the precursor ions are inspected for the presence of heteroatoms,
and both fragment ions and precursor ions are evaluated automatically
regarding the consistency of their elemental composition. Thus, the
number of possible molecular formulas can be reduced significantly,
which in turn assists characterization of both known and unknown metabolites,
discovered in untargeted metabolomics studies.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
and Reagents
Methanol (MeOH, LiChrosolv,
LC gradient grade) was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany);
acetonitrile (ACN, HiPerSolv Chromanorm, HPLC gradient grade) was
purchased from VWR (Vienna, Austria); formic acid (FA, MS grade) was
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Vienna, Austria). Water was purified
successively by reverse osmosis and an ELGA Purelab Ultra-AN-MK2 system
(Veolia Water, Vienna, Austria).

Analytical standards of both
natural isotope composition and uniformly 13C (U-13C)-labeled analogues, of 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3AcDON), diacetoxyscirpenol
(DIAS), fumonisin B1, B2, and B3 (FB1, FB2, FB3), griseofulvin (GRIS), HT-2
toxin (HT-2) and T-2 toxin (T-2), sterigmatocystin (STER), and zearalenone
(ZEN) were obtained from Biopure Referenzsubstanzen GmbH (Tulln, Austria).
All of these standard compounds were dissolved in ACN except for the
fumonisins, which were dissolved in ACN/water = 1:1 (v/v).

Preparation
of Multianalyte Standard Solutions
Analytical
standard solutions were mixed to obtain two multianalyte stock solutions.
Those contained identical concentrations of nonlabeled and the corresponding
U-13C-labeled analytes. The multianalyte standard stock
solutions were diluted with water to achieve a solvent composition
of ACN/water = 1:1 (v/v). The first multianalyte standard solution
was composed of 3AcDON, DIAS, FB3, HT-2, T-2, ZEN (native
and U-13C-labeled substances at a concentration of 1.1
mg/L each). The second multianalyte solution consisted of 0.9 mg/L
of both FB1 and FB2, 1.4 mg/L of GRIS, and 1.7
mg/L of STER.

Cultivation of Fusarium graminearum Samples
Culture filtrates of F. graminearum PH-1 were prepared in Fusarium Minimal
Medium (FMM) as described earlier29 using
either nonlabeled or U-13C glucose as sole carbon source. F. graminearum was grown in a UNIFILTER 24-well 10
mL filtration microplate equipped with a Whatman GF/C filter (VWR,
Vienna, Austria). In each well, a 1 mL aliquot of either nonlabeled
or U-13C-labeled glucose was inoculated with 2000 spores.
After 7 days, the 24-well microtiter plate was centrifuged for 10
min at 2000 rpm to separate the supernatant from the mycelium. Immediately
after centrifugation, acetonitrile was added to quench the culture
filtrates, resulting in a final relative acetonitrile concentration
of 30% (v/v).

Preparation of F. graminearum Samples Spiked with Multianalyte Standard Stock Solutions
For spiking experiments, only nonlabeled supernatants were employed.
Two multianalyte standard stock solutions were prepared each of which
contained both native and U-13C-labeled analogues at the
same concentration level. The first stock solution contained 3AcDON,
FB3, DIAS, HT-2, T-2 and ZEN standard each at a concentration
of 2.2 mg/L. The second stock solution comprised 3.1 mg/L of GRIS,
3.6 mg/L of STER, 2.1 mg/L of FB1, and 2 mg/L of FB2 standards. Varying
amounts of the stock solutions were evaporated to dryness at room
temperature under a gentle stream of nitrogen. Dried analytes were
redissolved in a mixture of fungal culture filtrate and ACN (2 + 1,
v/v) to yield 1:1, 1:3, 1:5, 1:20, 1:100, and 1:300 dilutions. The
1:300 dilution level was further diluted with culture filtrate and
ACN (2 + 1, v/v) 1:5 and 1:10. This dilution series led to analytical
standard concentrations of 0.7 μg/L up to 1.8 mg/L.

Preparation
of a Mixture of Nonlabeled and U-13C-Labeled F. graminearum Samples
The developed FragExtract
algorithm was applied to LC-HRMS/MS data derived from an untargeted
metabolomics experiment. For this purpose, quenched aliquots of nonlabeled
and U-13C-labeled supernatants were mixed together, resulting
in a final ratio of 1:1 (v/v), and measured by LC-HRMS, as described
in the following.

LC-MS and LC-MS/MS Analysis
All
types of samples (standards
and F. graminearum samples) were analyzed
as described earlier.29 In brief, a UHPLC
system (Accela, Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, U.S.A.) equipped
with a reversed-phase XBridge C18 analytical column, 150
× 2.1 mm i.d., 3.5 μm particle size (Waters, Vienna, Austria)
was employed at a flow rate of 250 μL/min. Eluent A was water,
eluent B was MeOH, both containing 0.1% formic acid (FA). The initial
mobile phase composition (90% A) was held constant for 2 min, followed
by a linear gradient to 100% B in 30 min. This final condition was
held for 5 min, followed by 8 min column re-equilibration at 90% A.

The specified UHPLC system was coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap XL (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI)
interface, which was operated in positive ionization at 4 KV electrospray
voltage and a capillary temperature of 300 °C. All other source
parameters were automatically tuned for a maximum MS signal intensity
of reserpine (Sigma-Aldrich (Vienna, Austria)) solution (10 mg/L).
For selection of metabolic features, nonlabeled and U-13C-labeled mixture of F. graminearum samples were measured in MS full scan mode (resolving power setting
of 60 000 fwhm at m/z 400,
scan range of m/z 100–1000,
profile mode).

LC-MS/MS measurements were carried out for the
following sample
types: pure multianalyte standard solutions, spiked F. graminearum samples, and mixtures of nonlabeled
and U-13C-labeled F. graminearum cultures (preselected features). Each of the tested samples was
analyzed with an LC-HRMS/MS method employing three successive scan
events: First, a survey full scan (resolving power setting of 30 000
fwhm at m/z 400, scan range of m/z 100–1000, profile mode) was
followed by two successive product ion MS/MS measurements of nonlabeled
and U-13C-labeled precursor ions, respectively. Centroid
product ion spectra were recorded in collision-induced dissociation
(CID) mode with a resolving power setting of 7500 fwhm at m/z 400 and a varying m/z range adapted to the analyte mass (higher m/z: ca. m/z of precursor ion; lower m/z: ca.
1/3 of precursor m/z). The isolation
width for the precursor ion was set to 2 (target m/z ± 1). For eight standard compounds, the
protonated molecule was chosen for fragmentation. For DIAS, HT-2,
and T-2 toxin, the sodium adducts were used as precursor ions. In
the case of nine selected feature pairs from mixtures of nonlabeled
and U-13C-labeled F. graminearum samples, six protonated ions, two sodium adducts, and one unknown
ion species were chosen as precursor ions for fragmentation (see Table S-3). The normalized collision energies
(CE in %) were optimized by flow injection analysis with single standards
in pure solvents. Ten microliters per minute of the respective standard
solution 1–10 mg/L in ACN/water = 1:1 (v/v)) was infused via
syringe pump into the mobile phase, which had a flow rate of 240 μL/min.
The mobile phase composition was
adjusted to the composition at chromatographic elution from the HPLC
column of the respective compound. This optimization resulted in CE
settings of 24% for 3AcDON, 37% for DIAS, 25% for FB1,
23% for FB2, 23% for FB3, 30% for GRIS, 29%
for HT-2, 40% for STER, 32% for T-2, and 34% for ZEN. For the FT-Orbitrap,
the automatic gain control was set to a target value of 5 × 105 and a maximum injection time of 500 ms was chosen for both
full scan and tandem MS measurements. Data were generated using Xcalibur
2.1.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Automated Data Processing
by FragExtract
The presented
FragExtract algorithm uses three successively recorded MS(/MS) spectra
within the LC-HRMS run (1) full-scan spectrum, (2) product ion MS/MS
spectrum of the monoisotopic 12C, and (3) MS/MS spectrum
of the U-13C precursor masses. Employing this information,
the algorithm is capable of unambiguously annotating fragment signals
of the respective precursor ions without the need of spectral comparisons
to tandem mass spectra libraries or the need of in silico fragmentations
of substances under investigation.

The algorithm uses a brute
force approach for the MS/MS fragment annotation and the calculation
of its respective number of carbon atoms. It was developed in Python
(version 2.7) using the Qt 4-SDK for the graphical user interface
and is available for the operating systems Windows and Mac OSX. The
program is capable of processing LC-HRMS(/MS) data in the common data
formats mzML35 and mzXML, which were suggested
by the Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI). The program comprises
a set of processing steps, which will be described in the following.

MS/MS Spectrum Selection
On the basis of predefined
MS/MS precursor masses of both the native 12C and U-13C-labeled target substance and their approximate retention
time extracted by MetExtract, the program searches the full scan data
to find the most intense signals of the native target precursor ion
within a certain user-defined retention time window. The two successive
product ion spectra of the native and U-13C-labeled substance
immediately after the peak maximum of the predefined precursor in
the full scan exceeding a user-defined mininimum intensity threshold
are selected for further processing.

Calculation of Carbon Atoms
in Precursor Mass
The maximum
number of carbon atoms (x(C)) for any MS/MS fragment
is calculated by dividing the difference of the measured m/z values of the native and the corresponding U-13C-labeled precursor ions by the exact mass difference of 12C and 13C (e.g., 1.00335, Δ m/z (12C, 13C) for singly charged
ions).  

Fragment
Signal Annotation and Calculation of Carbon Atoms Per
Fragment Ion
In order to gain sufficiently high fragment
ion intensities, limited selectivity of precursor selection has to
be addressed (e.g., isolation width = 2 or 3 u). Therefore, depending
on the isolation width setting, the first and/or second isotopolog
of the target compound may also be isolated in the mass analyzer and
subsequently fragmented, occurring as an isotopolog signal in the
product ion spectrum. These putative isotopolog signals should not
be included in further calculation steps and need to be removed from
the product ion spectra. For this purpose, m/z values larger than the target mass of the respective precursor
are not considered further. Then, m/z values of all fragments in each 12C and corresponding 13C MS/MS spectrum are sorted in descending order. If the mass
increment between two adjacent MS/MS signals corresponds to the mass
difference between 12C and 13C (i.e., 1.00335
u), the less intense signal will be marked as a putative isotopolog
(F + 1). With a mass error tolerance of ±5 ppm relative to the
mass of the fragment ion under investigation, F + 1 isotopologs can
clearly be differentiated from adjacent fragments differing in a single
hydrogen atom up to a fragment mass of 900 u.

For every remaining
fragment ion observed in the MS/MS spectrum of the 12C
precursor, the masses of possible corresponding U-13C fragments
are calculated using the formula below, where n(C)
denotes the potential number of carbon atoms for the fragment signal
and 12C m/zmeas denotes the measured mass of the fragment ion in the 12C MS/MS spectrum.  

The measured LC-MS/MS spectra of the U-13C substance
are inspected for the presence of these corresponding 13C m/zcalc fragment masses
within a user-defined mass window. For the used LTQ Orbitrap XL instrument,
this mass window was set to ±10 ppm. The range-scaled relative
intensities (set to a range between 1 and 100) in both spectra are
calculated separately and compared for each putative fragment ion
pair. Because the measured relative abundance of fragment ions in
product ion spectra is largely independent of the absolute precursor
abundance, the range-scaling of intensities will yield similar values
for correctly matched fragment pairs. By finding the 13C fragment ion that exhibits a mass of 13C m/zcalc ± 10 ppm and a comparable
relative intensity to the 12C m/zmeas fragment ion, the number of carbon atoms
for the particular fragment ion is calculated using the equation above.
Fragment ions without corresponding 13C m/z are not considered in further processing steps.

Molecular Formula Calculation of Fragment Ions and Precursors
First, a mass (m) for the noncharged fragment
ions (m/z) is calculated by considering
the mass of an electron. For each m, putative sum
formulas are generated, and those with an incorrect number of carbon
atoms (n(SumFormula) ≠ n(C))
are discarded. The user can define elements that shall be included
in the calculation of the elemental composition for each selected
fragment signal. On the basis of the publication of Kind and Fiehn9 rule no. 1 (restriction for element numbers),
no. 5 (heteroatom ratio check), and no. 6 (element probability check)
are also included in the presented workflow.

For chlorine and
sulfur, the algorithm automatically searches for the naturally occurring
isotopic signals (e.g., 37Cl, 34S) in the MS
full scan spectrum of the native and the U-13C-labeled
precursor to verify the presence of those elements before inclusion
for the molecular formula assignment. If either Cl of S is part of
a metabolite’s elemental composition, isotopologs containing 37Cl or 34S will appear at m/z values higher than the principal ion of the 13C isotopic cluster and can thus be recognized easily regardless of
the resolving power of the instrument.

Furthermore, to check
the elemental consistency and reduce the
number of possible molecular formulas for the precursor and the fragment
masses, an approach, thereafter named elemental composition filter,
based on the fragment consistency rule and the combinatorial consistency
rules stipulated by Rojas-Cherto et.al.22 are applied. To this end, CID product ion spectra are inspected
to test if the fragment ion under investigation with its annotated
elemental composition together with the mass of the neutral loss and
its annotated molecular formula can be traced to the precursor ion
and its formula. In a first step, putative elements and atom counts
of each molecular formula of the fragment ions are compared to the
putative molecular formulas of its precursor ion (postulated as described
above) to find the elemental composition of the precursor for which
most of the fragment formulas can be annotated. Once the best-fitting
candidate formula of the precursor is found, a second iteration is
started, in which the elements and element numbers of all molecular
fragment formulas together with the elements and element numbers of
their respective neutral loss formulas have to be traceable to the
formulas of the precursor from the first iteration.

Application
of the Algorithm to Multianalyte Standard Solutions
Spiked into Fusarium Culture Samples
Raw proprietary LC-MS/MS data files were converted to mzML data
format using msconvert of ProteoWizard.36 The user-defined positive list included the 12C and 13C precursor masses of all 10 tested fungal metabolites. The
minimum base peak intensity of the MS/MS spectrum of the native compound
had to exceed 100 counts. The inspected retention time window was
adjusted on the basis of chromatographic separation used in the LC-MS/MS
measurements from 3 to 30 min. To detect corresponding 12C/13C fragment ion pairs, a mass deviation of ±10
ppm to account for the interspectrum tolerance was allowed (Figures S-1–S-3). For the intensity ratio
of the 12C fragment ion to the corresponding 13C fragment ion a maximum error of 30% was allowed, and only fragment
ions with a relative intensity ≥2% were considered. For molecular
formula annotation of the precursor and the MS/MS fragments C, H,
N, O, Cl, S, and P were initially allowed. The maximum atom count
of those seven elements was derived from Kind and Fiehn9 (m/z < 500
Da: max C, 39; max H, 72; max N, 20; max O, 20; max P, 9; max S, 10; m/z < 1000 Da: max C, 78; max H, 126;
max N, 20; max O, 27; max P, 9; max S, 14). If either Cl or S was
detected, the tolerated atom count for the precursor mass was set
to at least one and the maximum to either 10 or 14, as described above.
Based on the mass accuracy achieved for the standard compounds in
MS full scan mode, a mass deviation of ±3 ppm was tolerated for
the evaluation of molecular formulas of the precursor ion. Furthermore,
Na was included for molecular formula calculation of HT-2, T-2, and
DIAS, because Na adducts were used as precursors for MS/MS measurements
of these three metabolites.

Application of the Algorithm to Selected
Unknown Metabolites
of a Fusarium Culture Sample
To demonstrate the suitability of the presented approach for untargeted
metabolomics experiments, samples of F. graminearum grown on either 12C or U-13C enriched glucose
were mixed and subsequently measured with an LTQ Orbitrap XL in full
scan mode. The acquired data was processed with the MetExtract software
according to the workflow for SIL-assisted untargeted metabolomics
experiments recently presented by Bueschl et.al.29 with the aim to extract 12C/U-13C
feature pairs. Both the native and the U-13C precursor
ions had to exhibit a minimum abundance of 105 counts in
at least three recorded scans for being selected for successive LC-HRMS/MS
measurements and evaluation by FragExtract. Subsequently, the ion
species (i.e., type of adduct) of such extracted metabolic feature
pairs was manually annotated if possible. From this list of nine metabolic
features, six [M + H]+, two [M + Na]+, and one
unknown ion species (Table S-3) were selected
for MS/MS measurements at three different collision energies (25%,
35%, and 45%). For annotation of the molecular formula of precursor
ions, the maximum tolerated mass deviation was set to ±3 ppm.
In addition, after manual evaluation of the MS full scan data, Fe
was also included for molecular formula calculations.

The reliability
of the fragment ion extraction was tested with
multianalyte standards spiked into F. graminearum culture filtrate, and the algorithm was applied to nine unknown
features derived from a F. graminearum culture filtrate sample of an untargeted metabolomics experiment.

The presented approach aims at the automated evaluation of high-resolution
tandem mass spectra, is based on the use of highly U-13C-enriched labeled compounds or labeled biological samples, and relies
on the successive LC-MS/MS recordings of 12C and U-13C-labeled substances. As native and U-13C-labeled
compounds show the same fragmentation behavior in tandem MS, the resulting
fragmentation pattern in the product ion spectra ultimately looks
the same, only shifted toward higher masses of the U-13C-labeled compound, as for example shown for 3AcDON in Figure 1b.

As a consequence of the highly similar
fragmentation patterns,
evaluation of the m/z value difference
between the corresponding native and U-13C-derived mass
signals directly yields the number of carbon atoms present in a selected
fragment ion.

When the derived carbon atom count per fragment
ion was considered
together with the methods described for molecular formula calculation
and the accurate mass of the respective ions, FragExtract unambiguously
annotated the correct elemental composition for all standard compounds
in both pure solvent and the spiked fungal culture samples. For the
true unknowns evaluated in the biological samples, which were analyzed
with the same settings as the standard solutions and F. graminearum samples, FragExtract’s algorithm
led to a maximum of two possible molecular formulas for precursor
and fragment ions. Readers who are interested in the algorithm and
use of FragExtract, which had been developed and is presented in this
study, are asked to contact the corresponding author.

output generated by automated MS/MS spectrum
annotation is exemplified with 3AcDON (Figure 1). When using FragExtract,
the user can decide which elements/elemental compositions to allow
or to exclude for generation of putative fragment formulas. Moreover,
because only those product ion signals are kept in the annotated LC-MS/MS
spectrum, which exhibit the required 12C and corresponding
U-13C pattern, the algorithm helps to efficiently filter
noise and background signals and to extract meaningful fragment ions
from the inspected LC-MS/MS spectra. For 3AcDON, the developed algorithm
was able to annotate 18 fragment ion pairs, all of which were uniquely
assigned and also manually verified (Table S-1
and Figure S-4). In the case of 3AcDON, restricting the number
of possible carbon atoms to that derived by the algorithm and the
additional application of the elemental composition filter, led to
unambiguously assigned molecular formulas, which corresponded to the
manually assigned molecular formulas (Table S-1). However, even if the number of carbon atoms is known, the higher
the mass of an ion, the higher the probability for obtaining ambiguous
elemental compositions. By the automated checking of the isotopic
pattern of the full scan MS spectrum of the U-13C precursor
for the presence of heteroatoms (see Experimental
section), Cl and S could be excluded by the algorithm leaving
only one possible molecular formula for each fragment ion and the
precursor mass.

Figure 1 FragExtract results for LC-MS/MS spectra of native and
U-13C 3AcDON standard. The numbers in the table (a) correspond
to the
annotated fragment signals highlighted in orange and blue in the original
product ion spectra of the native and the U-13C-labeled
precursor masses (m/z 339.1438 and m/z 356.2009) (b). For verification of
chromatographic peak shape and coelution of the fragment ions, the
extracted ion chromatograms of fragments that were annotated by FragExtract
are plotted by the software (c).

A possibility regarding further manual results refinement
is to
take the isotopic fine structure of nitrogen- and oxygen-containing
precursor ions in the high-resolution full scan data into account.
Especially for low molecular weight compounds in combination with
FTMS instruments enabling a resolving power ≥100.000, this
can help to determine the correct elemental composition, as suggested,
for example, by Kaufmann37 or Pluskal et
al.38 Moreover, the application of the
elemental composition filter helped to determine the formula of the
neutral intact ion, and furthermore, characteristic mass increments
were highlighted by the algorithm, which can help in elucidation of
a compounds structure. Thus, additional manual inspection of the automatically
generated results can be used to further confirm the correctness of
the obtained fragment formulas.

Results after Application
of FragExtract to Fungal Metabolite
Standards Spiked into Fusarium Culture
Samples
In view of future applications of the algorithm to
unknown substances that can be detected in untargeted metabolomics
experiments, we evaluated the performance of the algorithm under more
realistic conditions. At the example of spiked culture filtrates of F. graminearum, we evaluated whether signals from
the matrix (culture medium) or other signals of nonbiological relevance
would disturb the software algorithm. Therefore, analytical standard
compounds were spiked into culture filtrates of F.
graminearum in decreasing concentrations, as low abundant
precursor ions are a particular issue in the structure elucidation
process of metabolites in any biological study. The F. graminearum cultures were grown with a native
carbon source and the filtrates contained none of the compounds that
were spiked for verification purposes; the only exception was 3AcDON,
which in the full scan mode exhibited a maximum signal height of 1
× 103 counts for the nonspiked culture filtrates,
which is too low for generating MS/MS spectra.

Figure 2 shows LC-HRMS/MS spectra of native 3AcDON standard
in spiked F. graminearum culture filtrates
at the highest concentration tested (1 mg/L, Figure 2a) and the lowest concentration for which at least one fragment
signal could still be annotated (0.1 mg/L, Figure 2b). In Figure 2c, the extracted ion
chromatogram (EIC) of the precursor ion 3AcDON and EICs of selected
MS/MS signals are presented. For the LC-MS/MS spectra at 1 mg/L, we
found similar results compared to pure standards (i.e., no unspecific
MS/MS signals fit the predefined criteria). At a concentration of
0.1 mg/L, only one fragment signal (m/z 231.0996) was automatically annotated, which in contrast to the
other fragments found at this concentration showed a similar chromatographic
peak shape and retention time compared to the full scan EIC of the
precursor ion 3AcDON (m/z 339.1438).
The selected other fragments however could be classified as background
signals or pseudo ions (m/z 224.848
and 109.767) on the basis of their chromatographic behavior or represented
“spike” signals (m/z 320.055 and 271.779), observed only once in a single MS/MS spectrum.
Lowering the compound’s concentrations obviously leads to lower
precursor intensities and hence, less fragment signals, which can
be automatically recognized by the software (Table
S-2). It was shown for all 10 analytical standards spiked to
the culture filtrate that even at the lowest tested concentration
levels neither the presence of matrix compounds nor pseudo ions altered
the algorithm’s ability to filter unspecific MS/MS signals
(Figures S-5 to S-56).

The upper spectrum shows the fragment signals of the native 3AcDON

of 1 mg/L (a) and at approximately 0.1 mg/L (b). Combined view of

Application of the Algorithm to Selected Unknown Metabolites
of a F. graminearum Culture Filtrate
Sample
The established automated algorithm was applied to
a culture filtrate sample of a F. graminearum strain that was grown on liquid minimal medium containing either
native or U-13C-labeled glucose. Nine automatically detected
feature pairs (Table S-3) with a minimum
abundance of 105 counts were selected for subsequent MS/MS
experiments. Detailed results on the biological relevance will be
published elsewhere.

For eight of the nine tested metabolites,
each of the 12C fragments were unequivocally assigned to
a single corresponding 13C fragment. A summary of the results
for all unknown metabolites together with the annotated molecular
formula for the precursor mass can be found in Table S-3. Moreover, all LC-HRMS/MS spectra and FragExtract
derived fragment ions are listed (Figure S-57
to S-65) in the Supporting Information. For one metabolite (m/z 761.3612),
a total of eight multiple assignments at all three different collision
energies was annotated (e.g., one 13C signal could be assigned
to two different 12C signals), which translates to a multiple
assignment rate of approximately 7% (for 115 signals annotated in
total for one metabolite at three different collision energies). All
of those fragment ions exhibited a relative intensity of below 5%
compared to the most intense MS/MS signal. Therefore, the user can
set a relative intensity threshold for extraction and annotation of
fragment ions. For four of the unknown metabolites, unambiguous elemental
compositions were annotated (m/z 647.3724 at 23.9 and 26.74 min, m/z 651.5653 and m/z 787.5031). Interestingly,
for most of the tested precursor ions, annotated molecular formulas
indicated that they probably contained phosphorus. However, on the
basis of accurate m/z, number of
carbon atoms derived by the algorithm, prior exclusion of Cl and S
and number of phosphorus atoms per formula none of the metabolites
could be annotated when matched against Antibase. Nevertheless, for
all analyzed unknown metabolites, FragExtract performed a spectral
cleanup and restricted the number of possible molecular formulas to
one or two possibilities.

Application of the developed algorithm
resulted in the annotation
of two possible elemental compositions for the precursor ion at m/z 571.0856 (C30H19O12, C30H24O5NP3) and each of the annotated fragment ions. This metabolite could
be identified as aurofusarin (C30H18O12, monoisotopic mass: 570.0798 Da), as follows. The fragment ions
annotated by FragExtract were compared to the product ion spectrum
of the authentic standard of aurofusarin, which was measured at the
same collision energy and under the same experimental conditions as
the biological sample. The retention time of the putatively annotated
aurofusarin and the standard matched and the dotproduct between the
product ion spectra extract by FragExtract and the authentic standards
was 0.9977. Many of the neutral losses and the respective fragments
were typical for certain structural units, which additionally helped
in the identification process of aurofusarin (e.g., Δ CH3 for methyl, Δ CH2O for methoxy, Δ
CH3CO for methyl, and CO in the ring structure).

When more than one elemental formula is automatically annotated
by FragExtract, the decision which molecular formula is more likely
needs to be made case by case by manual inspection. With respect to
all further metabolites, evaluation with FragExtract provides a good
basis for detailed metabolite characterization in future studies.

Conclusions
Structure elucidation of unknown compounds still
is a major bottleneck
in untargeted metabolomics approaches. Our results illustrate that
stable isotope labeling with 13C shows high potential for
molecular formula determination of both intact molecules as well as
fragment ions as the number of carbon atoms can be derived from SIL-derived
LC-HRMS and LC-HRMS/MS data. The established FragExtract algorithm
is capable of efficiently filtering meaningful fragment signals from
MS/MS spectra of native and 13C-labeled compounds even
in the presence of highly complex biological matrices. We have demonstrated
that stable isotope labeling in combination with the presented algorithm
for automated data analysis can be effectively used to assist in the
automated characterization and elucidation of both certain structural
units, as shown for aurofusarin and unknown compounds found in untargeted
metabolomics experiments. The application of this novel software tool
significantly reduces data processing time and also allows the automated
annotation of tandem mass spectra. Moreover, the “cleaning”
of MS/MS spectra from nonspecific signals derived from background
or electronic noise is of particular interest for data storage in
MS/MS spectral databases, especially with regard to their use as references
for MS/MS spectrum similarity match and for the elucidation of unknown
compounds that occur in untargeted metabolomics experiments. In addition,
the software is suitable to process even MS3 or higher-order
fragmentation spectra. We expect that the presented automated approach
is of great interest for any researcher performing SIL-assisted metabolomics.
