We report the fabrication and characterization
of microwell-based
individually addressable microelectrode arrays (MEAs) and their application
to spatially and temporally resolved detection of neurotransmitter
release across a single pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell. The microwell-based
MEAs consist of 16 4-μm-width square ultramicroelectrodes, 25
3-μm-width square ultramicroelectrodes, or 36 2-μm-width
square ultramicroelectrodes, all inside a 40 × 40 μm square
SU-8 microwell. MEAs were fabricated on glass substrates by photolithography,
thin film deposition, and reactive ion etching. The ultramicroelectrodes
in each MEA are tightly defined in a 30 × 30 μm square
area, which is further encased inside the SU-8 microwell. With this
method, we demonstrate that these microelectrodes are stable, reproducible,
and demonstrate good electrochemical properties using cyclic voltammetry.
Effective targeting and culture of a single cell is achieved by combining
cell-sized microwell trapping and cell-picking micropipet techniques.
The surface of the microelectrodes in the MEA was coated with collagen
IV to promote cell adhesion and further single-cell culture, as good
adhesion between the cell membrane and the electrode surface is critical
for the quality of the measurements. Imaging the spatial distribution
of exocytosis at the surface of a single PC12 cell has also been demonstrated
with this system. Exocytotic signals have been successfully recorded
from eight independent 2-μm-wide ultramicroelectrodes from a
single PC12 cell showing that the subcellular heterogeneity in single-cell
exocytosis can be precisely analyzed with these microwell-based MEAs.

==== Body
Neurons and
other cells are
heterogeneous systems owing to specialized protein machineries and
lipid domains leading to spatial variations in the cell membranes,
nature, and location of exocytotic release.1,2 Several
kinds of well-established cell models for neuron cell exocytosis study
have been widely used for this kind of study.3 For example, the distribution of exocytotic activity has been found
to be spatially heterogeneous at the surface of the well-established
neuronal cell model, including the adrenal chromaffin cell4−6 and dopamine-secreting pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell line,7−9 resulting in locations (hot spots) where neurotransmitters are released
more frequently. This subcellular heterogeneity across a single cell
thus motivated the design of MEA devices capable of resolving the
spatial variation of exocytosis across a single cell. Different parts
of the membrane on the same cell or in the intact brain with different
exocytosis activity (hot spots or cold spots) have been confirmed
by use of these MEA devices.10,11 In related experiments
in vivo, the Michael group reported a method of constructing two or
four individually addressable carbon ultramicroelectrodes (radii ≈
1 μm) separated by a distance of ≈15 μm.12 Each carbon fiber was etched into a sharp tip
and then electrically isolated by coating the tip with poly(allylphenol).
These individual electrochemical arrays were used to simultaneously
probe dopamine release in the brain at multiple spatially separate
sites. Thus, the spatial resolution across single-cell membranes or
high-throughput sensing of multiple analytes, or the study of signal
transmission in cell networks can all be achieved with these MEAs.
However, most of these kinds of MEAs are used to collect vesicular
release information from the apical pole of single cells.

Recent
advances in the design of new thin film MEAs by Micro-Electro-Mechanical
System (MEMS) techniques have led to MEAs with a number of properties
that make them ideally suited to the analysis of biological systems
from the basal side of the cell. This technology involves the use
of successive steps of photolithography, thin film metal deposition,
and reactive ion etching to reproducibly fabricate individually addressable
MEAs for single-cell experiments.13−18 However, few papers have described individually addressable MEAs
with individual microelectrodes smaller than 5 μm,19,20 the typical size of the carbon fiber microelectrode that are used
for the detection of easily oxidizable neurochemicals from single
cells. Furthermore, most of these papers have reported single-cell
trapping or detection at a single electrode. The development of MEAs
with tightly packed microelectrodes small enough to allow quantitative
measurement of released molecules from exocytotic hot spots distributed
on the surface of a single cell would be very attractive for amperometric
measurements. We recently reported the fabrication of thin-film MEAs
and used these to electrochemically image the exocytotic release of
dopamine from cells clusters. These were 4 by 4 MEAs containing 4
μm width microelectrodes.21 However,
because one of the unique properties of tightly packed microelectrodes
in MEA methods is to investigate spatial heterogeneity of these exocytotic
events at the single-cell level, combining other techniques to precisely
attach single cells and to culture single cells on the surface of
MEAs is of interest. Additionally, development of smaller electrodes
is important for studies of single-cell heterogeneity and spatial
resolution. Recently, advances in lab-on-chip techniques have given
rise to integrated microfluidic devices and systems. Capture and/or
analysis of single cells with these lab-on-a-chip approaches by several
single-cell manipulation strategies have been carried out, including
microwell-based docking, electrokinetic or hydrodynamic single-cell
focusing, and injection techniques, etc.22−26

In this paper, we combine lab-on-chip techniques
(microwell) to
precisely trap single cells on the surface of MEAs with up to 36 electrodes
as small as 2 μm. We present the fabrication, characterization,
and application of this system to the analysis of cell exocytosis
by use of a 40 × 40 μm-sized square microwell for single-cell
trapping and single-cell culturing on the surface of multiple microelectrodes.
These microwell-based MEA combinations feature sizes compatible with
individual neuronal or neuronlike cells, thus offering subcellular
resolution of exocytotic imaging. Effective targeting and culture
of single cells in the microwell are achieved by combining cell-sized
microwell trap and micropipet picking techniques. The surface of the
microelectrodes in the MEAs has been coated with collagen IV to promote
cell adhesion. Steady state voltammetry has been applied to study
the activity of these microelectrodes. The spatial resolution of single-cell
exocytosis has been studied by use of multiple 2 μm microelectrodes
simultaneously from these microwell-based 6 × 6 MEAs.

Experimental
Section
Fabrication of the Microwell-Based MEAs
Figure 1 (panels A, B, and C) show three kinds of MEAs consisting
of 16, 25, 36 square microelectrodes with respective widths of 4,
3, and 2 μm. As previously described,21 Ti/Pt (5 nm/45 nm) were deposited on glass wafer by electron-beam
evaporator using lift-off techniques, and next, an insulation layer
Si3N4 film (425 nm) was deposited and then etched
by CF4 to form these MEAs with recessed microelectrodes.
Here we only emphasize how to fabricate microwells on top of MEAs;
we used the thick photoresist SU-8 2035 (MicroChem) to fabricate microwells
on top of MEAs, glass wafers with MEAs were spin-coated at 4000 rpm
for 1 min to yield a film thickness of about 25 μm. Then the
wafer was baked at 65 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 6 min, and
65 °C for 2 min on a hot plate. The 40 × 40 μm square
microwells pattern was defined on top of the MEAs by UV lithography
(KS MA6, Suss MicroTec) with a chrome mask showing the microwell design.
After UV exposure, it was subsequently baked at 65 °C for 2 min,
95 °C for 6 min, and 65 °C for 2 min on a hot plate. It
was then developed with SU-8 developer for 2 min with a mild shake.
Then the device was baked at 175 °C for 10 min on a hot plate,
finally forming a 40 × 40 μm size microwell on top of the
three kinds of MEAs (Figure 1, panels D, E,
and F).

Subsequently, a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chamber
(2 × 3 cm) was prepared and bonded to this SU-8 film on the glass
wafer for the cell-medium reservoir and for cell culture. Electrical
contact was achieved by manually placing connection pads on to the
glass wafer from the multiple pin heads of socket connectors (ELFA,
Gothenburg) by using silver paste 4922N (Dupont). The microwell-based
device was then baked at 100 °C overnight, and the final device
was obtained with the microwells on top of MEAs shown in Figure S1
of the Supporting Information.

Collagen Coating
and Single-Cell Culture on Top of Microwell-Based
MEAs
Mouse collagen IV (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA BD chemicals,
stock solution 1 mg/mL) was used for coating the surface area of the
PDMS chamber. A cell was then seeded in the SU-8 microwell on top
of a MEA, and the cell medium was added in the PDMS well on the glass
wafer for cell culture. Here we incubate about 2 mL of collagen IV
solution (1 μg/mL) in this PDMS well for 8 h. Then the PDMS
well was washed three times with 1× sterile Dulbecco’s
phosphate-buffered saline without calcium and magnesium. Cells were
then deposited into the PDMS chamber on the MEA device by adding 2
mL of PC12 cell suspension (about 104 cells/mL). After
loading cells on the PDMS chamber, a glass micropipet (tip diameter
about 5 μm) was used to pick up an individual cell and place
it into the microwell. Then the device was placed in the sterile incubator
for cell culture. Briefly, the cells were maintained and cultured
as previously described.21,27 For stimulated single-cell
exocytosis experiments, single cells were grown in the well on the
MEAs for 1–2 days before experiments, and the cell media was
replaced every day.

Electrochemical Imaging of Single-Cell Exocytosis
All
cell experiments were performed at 37 ± 1 °C. Single-cell
exocytosis was recorded from multiple microelectrodes by use of a
Triton+48-channel patch clamp amplifier (Tecella, Foothill
Ranch, CA), which was placed in a Faraday cage. Optical images of
microwell-based MEA experiments were obtained from a × 40 objective
(0.65 n.a.) with an inverted microscope (IX71, Olympus). The amperometric
current traces were processed using IgorPro 6.21 software (Wavemetrics,
USA), as David Sulzer’s group reported.28 After current events were detected with the software, current
traces and current events were checked manually to reject false positive
signals. False positives (about 5%) that were recognized by the software
were manually rejected and the fitting of the peak parameters was
adjusted. Other experimental details were performed as previously
described.21,29

Results and Discussion
Microwell-based
MEA device characterization
Figure 1 (panels A–C) show optical images of three
kinds of MEAs containing different size of microelectrodes. Figure 1 (panels D–F) show each type of MEA encased
into a 40 × 40 μm SU-8 microwell, which can be used to
trap a single cell on top of the array. SEM pictures of three kinds
of microwell-based MEAs are also shown in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information. These pictures clearly
show the whole MEA containing tightly packed multiple microelectrodes
tightly defined in a 40 × 40 μm square SU-8 microwell area,
which is potentially useful to trap a single cell. The success rate
for the fabrication of microwell-based MEAs is quite high, the average
success rate can be 95% for all MEAs, although for MEAs with the smallest
microelectrodes (2 μm width), the success rate is lower, and
for MEAs with larger microelectrodes (5 μm width) the success
rate is higher. When cells were placed in the PDMS chamber for cell
seeding, we manually placed a single cell in this 40 × 40 μm
SU-8 microwell by using a micropipet (tip diameter about 5 μm)
and a micromanipulator. Because of the collagen IV coated surface,
single cells adhere on the surface of the MEA in the well, when this
device is placed in a cell-culture incubator for 1 or 2 days. The
success rate for trapping single cells is approximately 80%, which
is comparable to other single-cell trapping approaches.22 Figure 1 (panels G–I)
show examples of single cells (each cell is identified with a red
dotted circle) successfully trapped inside microwells for the three
different kinds of MEAs. Since single cells are targeted to the electrodes
without nearby extraneous cells, individual cell responses can be
unambiguously recorded. Vigorous solution exchange can be carried
out without displacing cells from the electrodes. After each cell
culture and exocytosis experiment, the cell chamber was incubated
with 2% SDS, rinsed with deionized water three times, then rinsed
with acetone, isopropanol, and deionized water, blown dry with nitrogen,
and then cleaned with an oxygen plasma. The cell culture, cell exocytosis
experiment, and cleaning steps with this microwell-based MEA device
have been carried out about 20 times (several months) without significant
degradation of the electrochemical performance (Figure S2 of the Supporting Information).

Figure 1 Optical micrographs of
three kinds of MEAs, three kinds of microwell-based
MEAs, and single-cells trapping in three kinds of microwell-based
MEAs. (A–C) show MEAs consisting of 16, 25, and 36 microelectrodes,
respectively (scale bars are 10 μm); (D–F) show the SU-8
microwells on top of 4 by 4, 5 by 5, and 6 by 6 MEAs (scale bars are
10 μm); and (G–I) show examples of trapped single cells
(identified in red dotted circles) in microwell-based MEAs showing
16, 25, 36 microelectrodes, respectively (scale bars are 10 μm).

Figure 2 Electrochemical characterization of the microelectrodes
in three
kinds of microwell-based MEAs featuring (A) 4 by 4 MEAs, (B) 5 by
5 MEAs, and (C) 6 by 6 MEAs. The cyclic voltammograms (scan rate:
20 mV/s) were obtained in 1 mM FcMeOH in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) by sequentially
applying potential to each microelectrode. The black curves show the
average voltammogram obtained from the signals measured at each microelectrode
of the MEA, and the gray curves show the corresponding standard deviation
(SD) values (16 electrode MEA, n = 16; 25 electrode
MEA, n = 25; and 36 electrode MEA, n = 36).

We then characterized the electrochemical
performance of microelectrodes
in these three kinds of microwell-based MEAs. Cyclic voltammograms
of 1 mM ferrocenemethanol (FcMeOH) were obtained for these three kinds
of microwell-based MEAs by sequentially applying potential to each
microelectrode, as shown in Figure 2. Steady-state
voltammetric behavior is obtained for these three kinds of microwell-based
MEAs; the voltammetric waves are well-defined having sigmoidal shape
at this scan rate, and this agrees well with the microelectrode theory.
The diffusion-limited current (idl) was
measured for each electrode in different kinds of microwell-based
MEAs, and the averaged values for the 4 by 4, 5 by 5, or 6 by 6 microwell-based
MEAs are shown in Table 1.

The microwell-based
MEA device presented here has microelectrodes
with a recessed depth of 375 nm, possibly restricting the diffusion
of analytes to the microelectrode surface. The theoretical value for idl at cathodic potentials for a single, recessed,
microdisk electrode is given by 1  where n is the number of
electrons transferred in the reaction, F is the Faraday
constant, C is concentration of analyte, D is the diffusion coefficient, r is the
radius of microelectrode, and h is the depth of the
recess.30 This equation was used here to
approximate the measured current at a recessed square electrode for
geometric values compatible with the geometry of our system (we approximate
our square electrode as a disk electrode with r =
1/2 width of the square electrode, which were 2, 1.5, or 1 μm; h = 375 nm). The calculated theoretical idl values, for each kind of recessed MEA, are presented
in Table 1. The calculated idl values (485.9 pA for a single microelectrode from a
4 by 4 microwell-based MEA; 342.7 pA for a single microelectrode from
a 5 by 5 microwell-based MEA; 205.7 pA for a single microelectrode
from a 6 by 6 microwell-based MEA) in these three kinds of microwell-based
MEAs agree well with the experimental values (437.2 pA for a single
microelectrode from a 4 by 4 microwell-based MEA; 356.5 pA for a single
microelectrode from a 5 by 5 microwell-based MEA; and 215.3 pA for
a single microelectrode from a 6 by 6 microwell-based MEA). The agreement
is within 10%, suggesting that perhaps the working area is slightly
different as expected or the approximation of our square microelectrodes
by a microdisk electrode is not perfect. Figure S3 of the Supporting Information shows cyclic voltammograms
of 1 mM ferrocenemethanol (FcMeOH) for these three kinds of microwell-based
MEAs by simultaneously applying potential to 8 neighboring microelectrodes.
The experimental idl values obtained by
simultaneously applying potential to each microelectrode are much
lower than calculated or experimental idl values obtained by sequentially applying a potential to each microelectrode
of three kinds of microwell-based MEAs. The lower idl values apparently result from diffusional cross talk
induced by the short interelectrode distance. The limiting currents
from 4 by 4 MEA microelectrodes or 5 by 5 MEA microelectrodes obtained
by simultaneously applying potential to all microelectrodes (Figure
S3 of the Supporting Information) are ∼40%
smaller than the limiting current of each individually measured microelectrode
(Figure 2). The limiting current from 6 by
6 MEA microelectrodes obtained by simultaneously applying potential
to microelectrodes (Figure S3 of the Supporting
Information) is ∼22% smaller than the limiting current
at individually measured microelectrodes (Figure 2). These results clearly show the overlap of the depletion
layers between multiple electrodes when used simultaneously. Previous
theories have also shown that overlap in the diffusion fields at inlaid
neighboring electrodes can reduce the mass transport to the electrode,
thus leading to lower measured idl in
comparison to its theoretical value.8,31,32

Electrochemical Imaging of Release at a Single PC12 Cell
Compared to other MEAs, the smaller microelectrodes in the 6 by 6
MEAs are more useful for the study of single-cell exocytosis. This
is because more electrodes of smaller size can be used to cover a
single cell, and higher spatial resolution can be obtained. Here,
we mainly focus on the study of single-cell exocytosis studied with
the microwell-based 6 by 6 MEAs. Electrochemical imaging of single-cell
exocytosis by multiple microelectrodes is shown in Figure 3. A single cell is trapped and cultured on the surface
of a 6 by 6 microwell-based MEA containing 36 microelectrodes (Figure 3A). This single cell identified with a red-dotted
circle covered about 8 electrodes. The electrode number, which will be used further below, is also
shown in Figure 3B. An advantage of the 36-electrode
array is that we can image across a single-cell membrane with more
microelectrodes to confirm the active exocytosis location on the cell.
Electrodes 1–8 are covered by the cell in this example and
exocytotic events are observed at these electrodes upon stimulation
(Figure 3C). Representative amperometric traces
of exocytotic release from a PC12 cell are shown for 8 electrodes
following 25 s stimulations of the cell. A 4s current trace (Figure
S4 of the Supporting Information) expanded
from Figure 3C shows the noise level at different
microelectrodes (noise level is 1–2 pA). Different noise levels
are observed for different microelectrodes in the same MEA and might
result from the connection between the socket connector and the contact
pad of the MEAs on the glass wafer, where this is done manually using
silver paste. The contact resistance between the socket connectors
and different microelectrodes might be slightly different. The results
also show fewer current transients or exocytotic events at electrodes
E3 and E6, which confirms the heterogeneity of single-cell exocytosis
and that PC12 cells contain active zones of vesicle fusion and release.

Electrochemical imaging of exocytosis at a PC12 cell, similar to
that shown in Figure 3 (panels A–C),
is presented in Figure 3 (panels D and E).
Color plots of the release frequency at each microelectrode (1 s time
bins) in this array are shown in Figure 3D.
Higher release frequency is represented by light green and white color,
whereas lower release frequency is represented by dark green and black
colors. Time variations in release frequency at each microelectrode
are also shown in color plots (Figure 3E) based
on the optical image of a single cell covering multiple microelectrodes.
Each color square is an independent electrode from a 6 by 6 MEA. The
pictures shown here are focused on two stimulations performed during
the course of the experiment. The spots showing high release frequencies
can be easily identified from this graphical representation, which
shows the spatial release of dopamine and the exocytotic activity
in different microelectrodes or different parts of the membrane. A
movie built from the data presented in this figure is available as Supporting Information (see ac500443q_si_002.avi).
The subcellular spatial heterogeneity of exocytosis can be observed
in Figure 3. The location of “hot”
release spots has been found to vary with time across the surface
of a single cell. There are different numbers of vesicle events detected
at different stimulation time at the same electrode (see Figure S5
of the Supporting Information). The microwell-based
MEA allows detection of the localized membrane function in terms of
single-cell exocytosis. Furthermore, as shown on the frequency plots
(Figure 3, panels D and E), the electrodes
showing the highest release frequency are also the ones located over
electrodes fully covered by the cell (electrodes 1, 2, 4, and 5).
Fewer release events were measured in electrodes 3 and 6, and no release
events were detected by electrodes 7 and 8, which are partially covered
by the cell. Thus, the incomplete cell adhesion over the electrode
might also affect the detection threshold.

Simultaneous Exocytotic Events
The
incidence of concurrent
events on the same cell can be examined with the 6 by 6 MEA. When
more than one event occurs simultaneously, it is challenging to resolve
them using a single microelectrode. In the absence of spatial resolution,
these events will overlap and result in a large, broad current spike.
Simultaneous, parallel recordings using multiple microelectrodes allow
these events to be resolved based on spatial identification. Figure 4 shows a 0.5 s amperometric recording at a single
PC12 cell using a 6 by 6 MEA. The red arrows indicate four different
exocytotic events are detected from electrodes 1, 2, 4, and 5. The
events are extremely similar temporally, thus with only one larger
electrode they would form a single large, broader current spike. Although
rare, these overlapping events can be spatially resolved by this 6
by 6 MEA. The amount of neurotransmitter molecules released associated
with each of these concurrent spikes is reported in Table 2. Each of these values, measured at the four independent
electrodes, is in agreement with the mean amount of N for all the
events recorded during the course of the experiment. This observation
is in agreement with the possibility that these concurrent events
are produced by different vesicles simultaneously released at different
membrane regions in the single cell and detected at the same time
by MEA. A previous analysis and theory of electrochemical detection
of single exocytotic events at carbon microelectrodes showed that,
for an event whose features correspond to the mean of the exocytotic
parameters obtained from events recorded at a typical PC12 cell, the
sensing capability of the electrode decreases rapidly when the fusion
event is further than about 700 nm away from the electrode edge.33 However, as these four electrodes are adjacent,
and for huge vesicles or vesicle clusters in PC12 cells, it is possible
that an event might be detected more than 700 nm. If these peaks arise
from a single large event detected simultaneously at four different
locations then by summing the N presented in Table 2 for the 4 concurrent events, 324 × 103 molecules
would have been released in total. This would correspond to a very
large vesicle from a PC12 cell. From Figure 3C, we observed about ∼10% concurrent events occur in two neighboring
electrodes in our MEAs, and ∼1% concurrent events occur in
over two neighboring electrodes, we also observed that the concurrent
events occurring between E1 and E5 or E1 and E4 are much fewer than
the concurrent events between E1 and E2, E2 and E5, or E4 and E5,
which may be because the interelectrode distances between E1 and E4
or E1 and E5 are larger than the others, and we did not observe concurrent
events occurring in non-neighboring electrodes such as E1 and E3 or
E1 and E6. It is possible
that some events are very large and give rise to this behavior, or
it is possible that distinct concurrent events are more likely to
take place at adjacent places on a cell. We cannot discriminate these
possibilities with the current methods.

Conclusions
We
have fabricated microwell-based MEAs that can be used to spatially
probe chemical changes in tight spaces, such as studying exocytosis
from different regions of single-cell surfaces. These arrays are on
the order of 40 μm across and are geometrically well-defined.
Additionally, the MEAs have well-defined electrochemical behavior,
and up to 36 microelectrodes can be individually addressed. We used
these microwell-based MEAs for high-throughput amperometric measurement
of quantal exocytosis from individual cells cultured in microwells
without the need for microfluidic forces to be applied to the cell.
The 6 by 6 MEA has been used to simultaneously electrochemically monitor
exocytotic events from different surface regions of a single PC12
cell showing subcellular heterogeneity with 2 μm resolution.
Concurrent exocytotic events under different microelectrodes have
been resolved using these microwell-based MEAs.
