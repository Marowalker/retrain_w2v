Hydrophilic
strong anion exchange chromatography (hSAX) is becoming
a popular method for the prefractionation of proteomic samples. However,
the use and further development of this approach is affected by the
limited understanding of its retention mechanism and the absence of
elution time prediction. Using a set of 59 297 confidentially
identified peptides, we performed an explorative analysis and built
a predictive deep learning model. As expected, charged residues are
the major contributors to the retention time through electrostatic
interactions. Aspartic acid and glutamic acid have a strong retaining
effect and lysine and arginine have a strong repulsion effect. In
addition, we also find the involvement of aromatic amino acids. This
suggests a substantial contribution of cation−π interactions
to the retention mechanism. The deep learning approach was validated
using 5-fold cross-validation (CV) yielding a mean prediction accuracy
of 70% during CV and 68% on a hold-out validation set. The results
of this study emphasize that not only electrostatic interactions but
rather diverse types of interactions must be integrated to build a
reliable hSAX retention time predictor.

==== Body
Mass spectrometry
(MS)-based
proteomics is the driving technology for the characterization and
quantification of complex protein samples.1−3 With the current
advancements in instrumentation and software solutions, the number
of peptides and proteins that can be identified in a minimal amount
of time have increased dramatically.4 However,
deep proteome coverage of higher eukaryotes, mammalian cell lines,
or tissue is currently only feasible with extensive fractionation.5,6 The wide dynamic range of all the expressed proteins in a cell remains
a major challenge, leaving the least abundant proteins (and peptides)
undiscovered. In these cases, online (1D) reverse phase liquid chromatography
(RP-LC) does not yield the necessary separation of the proteome. Instead,
prefractionation is commonly applied to further reduce the complexity.
Ideally, the combined separation methods are as orthogonal as possible5,7,8 to ensure the separation of similar
analytes. Interestingly, high-pH RP is often used as prior fractionation
method even though it is not truly orthogonal to standard RP (low
pH). Importantly, there is no universal best prefractionation method.
Rather, the optimal separation method needs to be chosen based on
the analytes.9,10

While fractionation methods
offer great possibilities to reduce
the sample complexity, they usually require larger sample amounts
and preparation time. Usually, most fractions are injected separately
without pooling. Therefore, the peptide identification is fraction
aware. This extra piece of information can be incorporated into the
database search.11−13 To fully utilize this information, a computational
model needs to be developed that can confidently predict the retention
time of a peptide based on its amino acid sequence. The proteomics
community has successfully developed accurate models for the prediction
of the retention time in low pH RP-LC, which typically is coupled
directly to a mass spectrometer and therefore widely applied in proteomics.14,15 Retention times have also been predicted for other chromatographic
methods including high-pH RP-LC,16,17 hydrophilic
interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC),18 and strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX).19 Various algorithms have been applied for the described
prediction task: simple linear regression models,20 nonlinear models,21 support
vector regression models,11,16 artificial neural networks,22 or a physical model describing the chromatographic
process.23 For a comprehensive review,
the reader is referred to Tarasova et al.14 and Moruz and Käll.15

For
standard shotgun proteomics, hydrophilic strong anion exchange
chromatography (hSAX) is largely orthogonal to RP-LC.5 Currently, there is no model to predict the retention time
for hSAX. Moreover, the sequence specific features that influence
the retention behavior of peptides during hSAX are still unknown.
A common approach is to incorporate (limited) sequence information
into the prediction model by creating position specific retention
coefficients18 or neighboring amino acid
effects.24 It would be desirable to (1)
better understand the mechanisms governing the retention behavior
of peptides during hSAX and (2) build a predictive machine learning
model that confidently predicts the retention time of a peptide based
on its sequence information.

In this study, we analyzed the
chromatographic behavior of 59 297
peptides based on 29 hSAX fractions. We aim to contribute new insights
into the interaction of peptides during hSAX and quantify how sequence
features affect the retention behavior. To accomplish this, a machine
learning workflow is applied and validated using 5-fold cross-validation.
We developed a neural network model that predicts the retention time
for peptides from an hSAX fractionation. The predictive model and
the preprocessing are available in the Python package DePART (https://github.com/Rappsilber-Laboratory/DePART).

Methods
Experimental Details
The experimental data taken for
this study were published by Ritorto et al.5 In brief, the authors performed hydrophilic strong anion exchange
(hSAX) chromatography on macrophage cells from Mus musculus to test the peptide separation capabilities of hSAX followed by
mass spectrometry. The tryptic digest of the cell lysate was analyzed
with a LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro (Thermo Fisher Scientific, West Palm
Beach, FL). The fractionation was performed using an Ion Pac AS2425 column (2 × 250 mm, 2000 Å pore size,
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Part No.: 064153) with a 35 min gradient
(0 to 1 M NaCl; solvent A, 20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0; solvent B, 20
mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl). The functional group of the AS24
is an alkanol quaternary ammonium ion on a solid support that aims
at minimal hydrophobicity. Details of the sample preparation protocols
can be found in the original manuscript.5

Data Processing
For our study, Ritorto et al. made
the results of their previous experiments available as MaxQuant result
files. We postprocessed the MaxQuant evidence file. In total, 466 495
peptides were identified in 34 fractions. We applied stringent filtering
to avoid ambiguity in the training data. This initial set of peptides
was reduced by removing contaminants, decoys, “only by site”
identifications, and modified peptides (other than carbamidomethylated
cysteine). In addition, for peptides identified in two adjacent fractions,
the identification with the lowest intensity was removed from the
data set. Peptides identified in more than two fractions or in fractions
that were not adjacent were also removed from the data. Finally, fractions
with less than 300 unique peptide identifications were removed—leaving
59 297 unique peptide sequences distributed over 29 fractions
for the data analysis. As an independent data set, we used PXD006188,26 which was analyzed using MaxQuant27 (v. 1.6.1.0) and filtered as described above,
resulting in 93 372 peptides being identified in 32 fractions.

All processing was performed using Python 3.5 using the packages
numpy, scipy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, pandas, and seaborn.

Machine
Learning
For the computational modeling of
the retention time we followed two separate strategies, a regression
and a classification approach. In the regression case, a simple linear
model (LM) with a length correction parameter (LCP) was used. The
Python package pyteomics20 with LCP optimization
was used for the LM implementation. In the classification case, a
logistic regression (LR) and a feedforward neural network (FNN) were
used. In both cases, we evaluated (and trained) the model using the
accuracy metric, defined as the proportion of correctly predicted
fractions from all predictions. With the LM, such a metric is ill-defined
since no discrete fraction is predicted. Therefore, we defined a forced
accuracy metric by first rounding the predictions to the nearest integer
and then computing the accuracy.

The FNN was implemented using
Keras28 with the Theano29 backend. The network architecture consisted of four fully
connected layers with 50, 40, 35, and 29 neurons. As final activation,
the softmax function was used (Table S4). One strength of the simple additive model is the intuitive interpretation
of the learned coefficients: a peptide’s elution time increases
(or decreases) by a certain factor based on the amino acid count.
For neural networks, with nonlinear activation functions, the interpretation
is not as straightforward. Therefore, we added peptide features (e.g.,
pI or aromaticity) based on the literature11,30 and our initial exploratory data analysis to increase the predictive
power in the classification task. The complete definition of features
is available in Table S2.

The evaluation
of the prediction performance was based on a 5-fold
cross-validation (CV) strategy (including 75% of the data, 44 471
peptides). In addition, a hold-out validation set was used for the
final model assessment (25% of the data, 14 825 peptides).
In the CV setup, the training splits had 35 578 observations,
and the validation splits had 8894 observations. We describe the machine
learning workflow in more detail in the Supporting Information, including a performance comparison with other
classifiers.

Results
In the following section,
we present our results and propose a
model for the driving interactions in hydrophilic strong anion exchange
chromatography (hSAX) for peptides. The result section is divided
into four parts: (1) A general overview is given of the data and how
the retention time during prefractionation is influenced by charged
amino acids. (2) The influence of the charged amino acids is compared.
(3) The influence of usually noncharged amino acids is compared, and
finally, (4) a machine learning model is built to model peptide retention
during hSAX.

Peptide Retention in hSAX Is Driven by the Charged Amino Acids
We first investigated the influence of acidic (E, D) and basic
(K, R) amino acids on the retention behavior of peptides in an hSAX
fractionation experiment. Note that histidine residues will be uncharged
under the pH conditions used during fractionation. We used elution
data of 59 297 tryptic peptides from murine macrophage cells
separated into 29 fractions. Positively charged peptides elute early
(fractions 1 and 2) and are separated from uncharged peptides (fractions
4 and 5) which in turn are separated from negatively charged peptides
(fractions 7–29), where charge was calculated from the residues
E, D, K, and R (Figure 1a).

Figure 1 Effect of the charged residues on peptide retention in hSAX. (a)
Mean residue count per peptide for D/E (red) and K/R (blue) over fraction.
Error bars denote the standard deviation. Peptide count per fraction
is shown in orange (total 59 297 unique peptides). (b) Effect
of D/E count (range 0–5) on peptide retention. (c) Extracted
chromatogram of peptides with three and four D/E (red). Subpopulations
were defined according to the number of K/R residues (one to three,
blue tones for peptides with three D/E residues and green tones for
peptides with four D/E residues). Crosses mark the mode of the respective
distributions.

While the mean count
of D or E (D/E) residues in a peptide increases
with the fraction number, the mean count of K/R residues stays constant
(Figure 1a). In agreement
with this, missed cleavages are not enriched in any of the fractions
(Figure S1). The average retention behavior
of tryptic peptides appears to be mainly influenced by the occurrences
of D/E residues in the peptide sequence. These observations are also
supported numerically by their Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC)
of the summed residue charge per peptide and the observed fraction
number: for D/E residues, the PCC is −0.75; for K/R, −0.03;
and for D/E/K/R residues, the PCC is −0.83. The peptide length
on the other hand has a much smaller overall influence across all
fractions (PCC 0.33). Peptides with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 D/E residues
correspond on average to the fractions 3, 6, 10, 14, 18, and 20, respectively
(Table S1), thus, leading to a mean increase
per D/E residue of three fractions in retention time.

Even though
the mean increase of fraction numbers highly correlates
with the number of acidic residues, so does the D/E peak width (Figure 1b). In addition,
the higher the number of D/E residues in the peptide, the more complex
the distributions appear. Peptides with two D/E residues distribute
on two peak fractions, while peptides with four D/E residues distribute
on four to six peak fractions.

Therefore, we investigated the
influence of basic residues on the
retention time. Positively charged residues, lysine and arginine,
should weaken peptide retention during hSAX. Indeed, K and R residues
explain the multiple peak fractions of peptides with one D/E (Figure 1c). With an increasing
number of K/R residues, the retaining effect of D/E diminishes, and
thus peptides elute earlier. Since the effect is quite strong, in
terms of retention shift by a single K/R residue, there is most likely
a repulsion mechanism involved. Interestingly, the elution strength
of K/R residues seems slightly stronger than the retaining effect
of D/E residues: The mean fraction value of peptides with four D/E
residues and two K/R residues (summed residue charges equal to 2)
is 16.5, while for peptides with three D/E residues and one K/R (summed
residue charge also equal to 2), the mean fraction is 18.1. However,
this additional information on the K/R distribution does not fully
explain the observed substructures; there are clearly peak tails visible,
especially on the right side of the distributions (e.g., D/E, 4; K/R,
3 in Figure 1c).

Lysine Exhibits Stronger Electrostatic Repulsion than Arginine
We next evaluated if R and K differed in their effect on peptide
retention (Figure 2a). Peptides with four D/E residues were found in the factions 22,
17, and 11 (median fraction values) if they had one, two, or three
arginines while they were found in the fractions 21, 15, and 10 if
they had one, two, or three lysines. This means that lysines are more
strongly repelled than arginines in hSAX (on average, 1.3 fractions).
Statistical analysis using a Mann–Whitney–U (MWU) test
supports this observation. However, since the observed effect size
is rather small, the statistical significance should be interpreted
with caution (Figure S2a).

Figure 2 Detailed comparison of
relative contributions of positively (K/R)
and negatively (D/E) charged residues on peptide retention in hSAX.
(a) Effect size of K/R residues. Peptides with four D/E residues were
divided according to their K and R count (K, green tones; R, blue
tones). (b) Effect size of E/D residues. Peptides with either two
E or two D residues are shown, split according to their number of
K residues (1 or 2).

Similarly, we investigated possible differences between aspartate
and glutamate, peptides with either two D or two E residues and either
one, two, or three lysines (Figure 2b shows data for up to two lysines). For this subset,
the rounded median fraction number for peptides with two D or two
E residues is 12, 11, and 5 and 12, 11, and 5, respectively. This
leads to an average increase of 0.33 per fraction if there is an aspartate
instead of a glutamate in the peptide sequence. For the negatively
charged amino acids, we also conducted an MWU-test: although the observable
effect was even smaller, the test still resulted in a significant
difference between the retention behavior of D and E (Figure S2b).

Aromatic Amino Acids Play
a Key Role in Peptide Retention during
hSAX
As expected, peptide retention during hSAX is dominated
by charged residues. However, peptides with one set of charged residues
elute over many fractions. Therefore, charged amino acids do not suffice
to explain peptide retention alone.

As a first step to search
for additional contributions, a subset of peptides was selected (two
D/E residues, one R/K residue). Then, the effect size of an amino
acid on the retention time was estimated using the slope from a linear
regression model. The response variable was set to the mean composition
contribution of an amino acid, while the explanatory variable was
set to the fraction number. On the basis of the regression slope and
the derived p-value (under the null hypothesis that the slope is equal
to zero), the remaining amino acids can be divided into three categories:
(1) retaining—if the slope is positive and the p-value is smaller
than 0.05, (2) eluting—if the slope is negative and the p-value
is smaller than 0.05, and (3) no (significant) effect—if the
p-value is larger than 0.05. Accordingly, the (aromatic) amino acids
F, Y, and W show the strongest retaining effect based on the regression
slope (Figure 3, Figure S4). Interestingly, peptides with 0 aromatic
residues are found in a sharp symmetrical distribution. With increasing
aromatic amino acids in the peptide sequence, the distributions shift
to later retention, become broader, and develop a right tail (Figure S6). In contrast, the amino acid contributions
of A, P, and S and Q, T, and V show an eluting effect. For these amino
acids, the subpopulation peaks look very sharp, even with increasing
residues of the same group. The remaining amino acids C, I, N, G,
L, V, H, and M do not show a clear trend and thus could be classified
neither as eluting nor as retaining. Subtracting the weighted counts
of the aromatic residues (0.8W + 0.6Y + 0.3F) to the residue charge
increases the initial PCC from −0.83 to −0.86. Adding
the weighted counts of the residues A, P, Q, S, T, and V (factor 0.1)
further increases the retention PCC to −0.88.

mark the mode of the subpopulations.

A Neural Network Achieves the Highest Prediction Accuracy
As the final step in our analysis, we built a machine learning
model to predict the retention time of a peptide based on its sequence
features. After initial hyperparameter optimization for a set of classifiers
and regressors (Supporting Information S3),
we chose a linear regression model (LM), a logistic regression model
(LR), and a feedforward neural network (FNN) for further analysis.
The coefficients of the LM are shown in Figure 4a. As expected, the sign and magnitude of
the coefficients largely match our manual analysis: First, the basic
residues have a strong eluting effect on the retention time (large
negative coefficient). Second, the acidic residues and the aromatic
residues have a strong retaining effect on the retention time (large
positive coefficient). In addition, the nuances regarding the effect
size of the basic residues also fit our previous description that
R is marginally stronger repelled than K. This is most likely due
to the lower basicity of K. Similar to the coefficient representation
from LM, FNNs can be used to estimate approximately the influence
of the input features by analyzing the input weights of the first
layer. Since we also used position specific features in the machine
learning workflow, the average of the input weights can be used to
roughly measure these position dependent contributions to the retention
in hSAX. Most importantly, it appears that the influence of D/E residues
decreases with distance from the termini (Figure S7). Further, S/T/V/A/P/Q residues roughly follow a similar
trend. In contrast, W/Y/F/H do not show decreasing weights for internal
residues—the influence is rather stable across the positions.
For the remaining amino acids (I/G/L/C/M/N), the weights are noisy
and do not follow a clear pattern. This observation fits the estimation
of their influence from the regression model. Therefore, the influence
of these amino acids cannot be clearly defined.

Linear Model (LM), Logistic Regression (LR), Feedforward Neural Network
(FNN).

A neural network was most successful
in predicting the correct
peptide fraction, as assessed by 5-fold cross-validation (Figure 4b). With an accuracy
of 70 ± 0.81% (mean ± standard error of the mean), the classification
algorithm outperformed the linear regression model (22 ± 0.13%
accuracy) and the logistic regression model (48 ± 0.07% accuracy).
With a lower prediction resolution, e.g., evaluating the accuracy
in a window of ±1 fraction (1-off-accuracy), 92 ± 0.19%
were correctly classified. Although optimization aimed for accuracy,
the best performing FNN classifier also achieves a higher correlation
coefficient on a hold-out validation set (never used for training)
than the LM. The FNN achieves here a PCC of 0.94 where the LM achieves
a PCC of 0.9 (Figure 4c). The accuracy on this validation set was comparable to the CV
error with 68% accuracy and 92% one-off accuracy. As the accuracy
metric already indicates, the LM performs much worse as seen in the
marginal distributions (Figure 4c). The distribution of the predicted fractions does not appear
similar to the observed fraction distribution. The FNN can better
capture the nonlinear relationship and thus predicts the true fraction
with a higher accuracy—which is supported by the similarity
of the marginal distributions of the predicted and true fractions
of the peptides in the validation set.

Finally, we wondered
if the results obtained for data by Ritorto
et al. would also be obtained with a different data set by independent
investigators. We downloaded an hSAX data set from ProteomeXchange
(PXD00618826) and repeated our analysis. For these data, the training
set comprised 70 029 unique peptides and the validation set,
23 343 unique peptides. The accuracy during CV increased on
the test data to 69 ± 0.21% and on the validation data to 72%.
The one-off accuracy even increased to 96%, most likely due to higher
number of training instances.

Discussion
Fractionation
methods such as ion exchange chromatography (IEX)
are popular tools for enrichment of certain analytes and separation
of complex samples. To perfect the separation process, a basic understanding
of the underlying principles must be developed. For the principles
behind the retention time of peptides in hSAX chromatography, a linear
model is a useful starting point.

Our exploratory analysis as
well as the modeling approach showed
that electrostatic forces, as expected, are the most important interactions
in hSAX. A previous study that compared several fractionation methods
for phosphopeptides also reported a strong correlation of the acidic
amino acids with the elution time of peptides.9 The resolution based on simply counting the D/E/R/K residues is
enough to roughly map the elution time of a peptide to ±5 fractions
(on average). This simple approach is supported by a good PCC (−0.83)
of the summed residue charge and the elution time. However, differentiating
the repelling (K/R) and retaining (D/E) effect sizes should further
improve the resolution. Additional improvements can be achieved by
including the influence of the aromatic amino acids (W, Y, F; PCC
−0.86).

The retaining effect of the aromatic amino acids
could be explained
through cation−π interactions: a well-known interaction
from organic chemistry. Since aromatic amino acids have a delocalized
π electron system, the flat face of the aromatic ring has a
partial negative charge which attracts cations and thus enables strong
electrostatic interactions.31,32 Cation−π
interactions are also essential for many biological processes and
protein folding, in which K/R residues can also function as cations
and thus reinforce bonds within a protein structure. Possibly, cation−π
interactions also happen within a single peptide and therefore lead
to a competition between the stationary phase and the side chains
of K/R. Multiple aromatic amino acids in a peptide sequence lead to
nonlinearity in the retention behavior, i.e., multiple aromatic amino
acids support the interactions with the stationary phase more than
expected from adding individual contributions, possibly by forming
sandwich complexes of two aromatic amino acids and a cation.

For tryptic phosphopeptides, it has been shown that the peptide
C-terminus is likely oriented toward the stationary phase33 during the separation in anion exchange chromatography.
Presumably, this also holds true for peptides in hSAX. However, comparing
the neural network weights revealed that the influence of, e.g., D
or E residue is not per se decreasing from the N-terminus to the C-terminus
as has been observed for the SCX model.33 Thus, it is possible that the peptide orientation in hSAX is bidirectional—or
that D/E residues show a different elution behavior when near the
termini. If the orientation of the peptide is indeed with the N-terminus
toward the stationary phase, the decrease of the neural network weights
is explainable with the limited accessibility of the acidic side chains
when the residue is buried in the sequence. The same argumentation
holds true for the orientation of the N-terminus toward the stationary
phase. However, since we only analyzed tryptic peptides with basic
side chains on the C-terminus, it seems unlikely that they would prefer
this orientation. Another hypothesis is that the influence of C-terminal
D/E residues is not directly through the interaction of the residues
with the column but through intrapeptide interactions. For example,
acidic side chains of D/E and basic side chains of K/R could form
salt bridges. Thus, the closer the D/E residues are to the C-terminus,
the larger is the contribution or effect in the determination of the
retention time.

The retention time prediction field is fairly
mature, and a selection
of published tools achieved an R2 ≥
0.90, according to a recent literature review.14 While most solutions achieve a very high correlation (and R2), the true accuracy (defined as true predictions/(true
+ false predictions)) is seldom evaluated. The models used to predict
the fraction either do not provide an easily accessible probability
or prefer to model the prediction task as a regression problem19 allowing R2 to be
calculated. We modeled the prediction in a classification setup, using
a feed-forward neural network (FNN). Here, accuracy is an appropriate
evaluation metric. Accuracy is used to evaluate classification problems,
and the algorithm was trained to optimize the accuracy and not R2. With the current implementation, the FNN
achieved an accuracy of 70 ± 0.81% during CV and 68% on the hold-out
validation set. The accuracy is a stricter metric than the correlation
coefficient or R2; the one-off accuracy
increases on the CV data set to 92 ± 0.19% and on the hold-out
validation data set to 92%. One additional advantage of the FNN is
that each prediction is associated with a probability. This is a useful
feature since it allows selection of more confident predictions or
incorporation of the uncertainty in postprocessing.

Conclusion
We presented a first description of the parameters that influence
the retention of peptides during hSAX chromatography. As expected,
the charged amino acids largely define the retention behavior of tryptic
peptides. However, the aromatic amino acids also have a large impact
on the retention behavior presumably through cation−π
interactions, which makes the retention mechanism of hydrophilic anion
exchange chromatography more challenging to describe. Nevertheless,
the proposed neural network model achieves a high accuracy of 68%
on the hold-out validation set paired with a high correlation value
of 0.94—which enables the usage of our model for statistical
modeling of the confidence of peptide identifications based on prefractionation.
In the future, we want to further improve our model with more training
data, support for post-translational modifications, and incorporation
into a robust scoring metric for peptide identification.
