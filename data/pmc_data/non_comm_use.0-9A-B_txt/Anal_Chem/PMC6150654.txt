When
using biosensors, analyte biomolecules of several different
concentrations are percolated over a chip with immobilized ligand
molecules that form complexes with analytes. However, in many cases
of biological interest, e.g., in antibody interactions, complex formation
steady-state is not reached. The data measured are so-called sensorgram,
one for each analyte concentration, with total complex concentration
vs time. Here we present a new four-step strategy for more reliable
processing of this complex kinetic binding data and compare it with
the standard global fitting procedure. In our strategy, we first calculate
a dissociation graph to reveal if there are any heterogeneous interactions.
Thereafter, a new numerical algorithm, AIDA, is used to get the number
of different complex formation reactions for each analyte concentration
level. This information is then used to estimate the corresponding
complex formation rate constants by fitting to the measured sensorgram
one by one. Finally, all estimated rate constants are plotted and
clustered, where each cluster represents a complex formation. Synthetic
and experimental data obtained from three different QCM biosensor
experimental systems having fast (close to steady-state), moderate,
and slow kinetics (far from steady-state) were evaluated using the
four-step strategy and standard global fitting. The new strategy allowed
us to more reliably estimate the number of different complex formations,
especially for cases of complex and slow dissociation kinetics. Moreover,
the new strategy proved to be more robust as it enables one to handle
system drift, i.e., data from biosensor chips that deteriorate over
time.

==== Body
Biological
medicines, such as
peptides, proteins, mRNA, oligonucleotides, vaccines, and plasmids,1−4 are a strongly growing area of importance for the pharmaceutical
industry.5,6 Reliable analysis of biomolecular interactions
is crucial in order to fulfill modern drug quality assurance criteria,
both for traditional small API molecules7 and for next-generation biological drugs. Therefore, there has been
an accelerated technological development of biosensor instruments
based on, among others, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and quartz
crystal microbalance (QCM).8−10

The interaction data from
Bbiosensor instruments is nearly always
processed using a simple model fitting procedure assuming just one,
or sometimes two, distinct interactions (complex formation reactions)
with or without mass transport limitations.8,11−15 In a global benchmarking study, 150 participants from 20 different
countries were provided with aliquots of two binding partners (a 50-kDa
Fab and a 60-kDa glutathione S-transferase [GST]-tagged Ag) that form
a relative high affinity complex.11 The
participants were asked to determine the rate constants for the interaction.
The majority of the participants fitted the data to a simple or mass-transport
limited one-to-one model. Only four of the participants fitted to
a two-to-one interaction model.11 The authors
speculated that more advanced models were applied to compensate for
nonspecific interactions. Other studies12,13 suggest that
experiments should be redone using, e.g., alternative immobilization
techniques if one-to-one model does not fit well. Applying models
that are more complex is not preferred, and one should “go
back and redesign the experiment to improve the quality of the data”.12 In some extreme cases, data that do not fit
the model are excluded.16 Rich et al. state
that a more complex model fits always better, “simply
because it fits better does not mean it is correct”,12 which, of course, is true. The use of a more
complex model will result in a better model fit, but it will not necessarily
reveal the system’s true mechanistic behavior. However, it
is also true that if a more complex model fits the data better, it
will more accurately describe the system’s behavior during
the studied time range, even if the more complex model does not reflect
the system’s true mechanistic behavior it will be a very accurate
model of it. As biological systems are indeed complex, it is very
risky to use only the simplest kinetic model regardless of how well
it fits the data. Regardless of the model, if the model fit is poor
it does not describe the system accurately.

If the complex formation
reactions are sufficiently fast to reach
steady-state, one way to accurately estimate the number of interactions
is to use a three-step approach based on an algorithm called Adsorption
Energy Distribution (AED) calculations.17,18 This approach
has been used for adsorption studies in several publications, both
for SPR19 and QCM20,21 biosensors. However, AED has limited use for biosensor data since
steady state, which is rarely reached in most biological biosensor
applications of interest, is required. Therefore, a numerical tool
similar to AED, called Rate Constant Distribution (RCD) or Interaction
Maps,22−24 has been developed for biosensor data. Using RCD
calculations, one gets the number of interactions needed to describe
the system, and their associated rate constants, as peaks on a surface.
However, RCD calculations are not usually part of biosensor instruments
software, and the implementations that do exist take up to days to
calculate a single RCD.23 Our new Adaptive
Interaction Distribution Algorithm (AIDA)25 does not only give higher resolution since it adapts to the solution,
but it is also fast, the calculations take only a few seconds, and
thereby allows RCDs to be used as a standard tool.

The aim of
this study is to introduce and evaluate a new four-step
strategy, based on our new numerical algorithm AIDA, for more reliable
analysis of interaction data. Verification will be done using both
synthetic and experimental data obtained from three different experimental
systems exhibiting fast to slow interactions. The new strategy will
also be compared to the conventional method, i.e., to simultaneously
fit a one or two-site kinetic model to all sensorgrams, so-called
global fitting. This four-step strategy can also be applied to the
clarification of interactions between biomolecules and cell surfaces,
present in a very complex and biologically relevant environment where
a more complex fitting model is often needed.

Theoretical Section
For a more detailed description of the theory, see the Supporting Information. Here we will assume that
we have a biosensor system where the kinetics is described by an “n-to-one” model, i.e., we have n interactions of the following type, 1  in the system. Here [Ai] is an injected
analyte, [L] is a ligand immobilized on the
biosensor chip surface, [AiL] is a complex
formed between the analyte and the ligand, and this reaction has the
corresponding association and disassociation rate constants, ka,i and kd,i, respectively.

If we have n different interactions in the system
of the type in eq 1,
the total response of the system will be the sum of the individual
responses of the interactions. Here we define the contribution ci of interaction i to the total response as the mean of the interaction’s relative
contribution to the association and dissociation phase.

In a
practical situation, we want to estimate the rate constants ka,i, kd,i from experimental sensorgram data. This
is usually done by fitting all experimental sensorgrams simultaneously
to a model with one, or perhaps two, interaction(s) of the type in eq 1. Assuming the “n-to-one” kinetic model in eq 1, a useful simple tool that indicates if one
has one or more interactions in the biosensor system is the dissociation graph. Here ln[R(t)/R0] is plotted against t for the dissociation phase, R(t) is the response at time t, and R0 is the response at the start of the dissociation phase.
If the resulting curve is near the top-left to bottom-right diagonal,
then there is only one interaction in the system, but if it is convex,
then there are at least two different interactions in the system.
Note that only the shape of the graph is important,
so for the clarity of presentation, axis numbering is omitted here,
see for example Figure 1b.

In part d, the circled areas are proportional to the relative contributions,
the crosses indicate median rate constants, and the stars are the
estimated rate constants from global fitting to a two interactions
model. See the Supporting Information Table S1 for rate constants.

It is well-known that the assumption of a “n-to-one” kinetic model might not hold in some cases.
For example,
Ogi et al. have studied the effect of flow rate on determined rate
constants between human IgG and protein A.26 They found that an increase of the flow rate 20 times lead to an
increase, in both the association and dissociation rate constant,
with a factor of three. However, our proposed strategy can be used
as an accurate representation of a wide range of different systems,
regardless of the true underlying interactions. In a similar way as
any measured signal can be represented with a Fourier series expansion,
whatever the true underlying process(es) that generates the signal
are.

Rate Constant Distributions
If we let the number of
interactions in the system → ∞, assuming interactions
of the type in eq 1,
the total response of the system can be modeled by an inhomogeneous
Fredholm Integral Equation of the first kind. One can estimate a so-called
Rate Constant Distribution (RCD) by solving the corresponding inverse
Integral Equation problem using an algorithm called AIDA, developed
by us.25 In an RCD we have the interaction
contribution vs the rate constants ka and kd, see for example Figure 1. An RCD consists of a number of discrete
distributions, and the mode of these distributions can be viewed as
estimates of the biosensor systems rate constants.

Calculation
of RCDs using AIDA25 is considerably faster
than fitting to the experimental data, and here we do not have to
select the number of interactions in the system. However, RCDs should
be used with caution, as they are the solution of an ill-posed and
ill-conditioned inverse problem, and the solution depends heavily
on the amount and type of regularization applied. One generally needs
to use several sensorgrams when calculating an RCD in order to get
reliable results and a good advice is to check the results by also
doing model fitting. When using several sensorgrams, and proper regularization,
one can get a good estimate of number of interactions and their corresponding
rate constants from the peak maxima. These can, for example, be used
as input to the fitting algorithm, but one should never try to draw
any conclusions about the system from the peak shapes.

In the
proposed strategy, we will calculate RCDs separately for
each sensorgram, and the resulting RCDs can be used as a guide to
decide the number of interactions and their rate constants.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals and Materials
Trastuzumab (Mw 145531.5 g/mol) (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), purified
recombinant human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) (R&D
Systems Europe Ltd., Abingdon, United Kingdom), parathyroid hormone
(1-34) (PTH) (Mw 4117.75 g/mol) (Tocris
Bioscience, Bristol, U.K.), and Human PTH1 receptor with a His-tag
(NovoPro, Shanghai, China) was used. Zeba spin desalting column from
Thermo Fisher Scientific, was used to for the buffer exchange of trastuzumab.
Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless noted otherwise.
Hydrochloric acid (0.1–1.0 M) and sodium hydroxide (0.1–1.0
M) were obtained from Oy FF-Chemicals (Yli-Ii, Finland). Phosphoric
acid was from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Ammonia (25%) was purchased
from Riedel-de Haën (Seelze, Germany). NaCl was from Fisher
Chemicals (Loughborough, U.K.). Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium
salt dihydrate (Na2EDTA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), sodium
citrate trihydrate, and sodium azide were from Sigma Chemicals Co.
(St. Louis, MO). Gentamycin sulfate (BioReagent, suitable for cell
culture) was from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland). Sulfo-N-hydroxy-succinimide (S-NHS, 98.0%) and 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)
carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC-HCl, 98.5%) were purchased from Aladin
Chemical Reagent Company (Shanghai, China). The water used in the
experiments was purified in a Milli-Q system (Millipore AB, Billerica,
MA) and a Millipore water purification system (Millipore, Molsheim,
France). Intermediate-Density Lipoprotein (IDL)-Very Low-Density Lipoprotein
(VLDL) and antihuman apoB-100 (anti-apoB-100) monoclonal antibody
(Mab) were produced according to ref (27). Molar concentrations of IDL-VLDL were calculated
using the molecular weight of apoB-100 (512000 g/mol).

The Attana
Cell 200 (Attana AB, Stockholm, Sweden) QCM Biosensor was used for
the trastuzumab-HER2 and PTH-PTH1R experimental analyses. The Attana
A100 instrument (Attana AB, Stockholm, Sweden) was used for the IDL-VLDL-anti-apoB-100
Mab experimental analyses.

The fundamental frequency of the
crystals in this study was around
10 MHz in thickness shear mode. The immobilized protein constitutes
a rigid layer and is suitable for the following kinetic measurement.
Thus, the Sauerbrey equation28 should give
a good approximation for correlating sensor response to adsorbed amount
of solute; in other words, the sensor signal is proportional to the
adsorbed amount of solute on the chip.

Sensor Procedures
Synthetic
Assay
For the synthetic data we used a system
with two interactions and rate constants log10(ka,1) = 6.00 (M s)−1, log10(kd,1) = −2.50 s–1, log10(ka,2) = 4.50 (M s)−1, log10(kd,2) = −1.50 s–1 with Rmax,1 = 100.0 RU, Rmax,2 = 500.0
RU. We made 10 injections with concentrations C =
5, 13, 24, 37, 55, 77, 105, 137, 175, and 220 nM, and the injection
time was 100 s and the run time was 600 s. To simulate a deteriorating
system, Rmax was set to 95% of the value
in the previous injection.

HER2 Assay
HER2 was amine coupled
to a LNB-carboxyl
chip using the manufactures’ amine coupling kit and protocol
(Attana AB, Stockholm, Sweden). In brief, 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl,
0.005% Tween-20, pH 7.4, was used as immobilization buffer. Carboxyl
groups on the chip surface were activated by a 50 μL injection
of 0.2 M EDC and 0.05 M S-NHS. A volume of 50 μL of HER2 (5
μg/mL diluted in 10 mM acetic acid, pH 4.5) was injected over
the activated surface at a flow rate of 10 μL/min. The frequency
change was typically between 20 and 30 Hz. Finally, free carboxyl
groups were blocked by a 50 μL injection of 1 M ethanolamine
pH 8.5.

The adsorption data for trastuzumab at 35 °C were
acquired by 35 μL of trastuzumab (1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 25
μg/mL) at a flow rate of 20 μL/min. Following dissociation
for 300 s the surface was regenerated with a 6 μL injection
of 10 mM glycine pH 2.0 (Acros Organics, Fisher Scientific) and re-equilibrated
with running buffer (phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, Giboc,
Fisher Scientific). Blank injections were performed prior to every
analyte injection, see Figure S1 in the
Supporting Information, and after each analyte injections, the loops
were washed with 100 mM acetic acid and repeated washes of running
buffer.

Anti-ApoB-100 Assay
Anti-apoB-100 Mab was immobilized
onto LNB-carboxyl chip (Attana AB, Stockholm, Sweden) using amine
coupling according to the protocol described in a previous study.27 In brief, the chip was prewetted ex
situ with 20 μL of Milli-Q and left to stabilize in
the instrument. The immobilization was performed at the flow rate
10 μL/min under 25 °C with 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005%
Tween 20, pH 7.4, as the immobilization buffer. The surface was activated
once by injecting 50 μL of freshly mixed 0.4 M EDC and 0.1 M
S-NHS (1:1, v/v). Followed by two injections (50 μL each) of
anti-apoB-100 Mab (100 μg/mL in phosphate buffer; pH 6.4). The
frequency change was typically between 30 and 60 Hz. Deactivation
was done with two injections (50 μL) of 1 M ethanolamine solution
(pH 9.0).

The adsorption data of IDL-VLDL at 25 °C were
acquired by 35 μL IDL-VLDL injections (3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30,
35, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, and 110 μg/mL) on the amine
coupled chip at the flow rate of 50 μL/min using phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4) as the running buffer. Blank injections were performed prior
every analyte injection, see Figure S2 in
the Supporting Information. Following dissociation for 500 s, the
surface was regenerated with a 0.28 M ammonium hydroxide (pH 11.5)
and re-equilibrated with running buffer. Running buffer was prepared
as described in ref (27).

PTH1R Assay
PTH1R was amine coupled to a LNB-carboxyl
chip using the manufacturer’s amine coupling kit and protocol
(Attana AB, Stockholm, Sweden). The coupling was done according to
the description for the HER2 assay above. With the exception that
50 μL of PTH1R (10 μg/mL in 10 mM acetic acid, pH 4.5)
was injected over the activated surface at a flow rate of 10 μL/min.
The frequency change was typically between 20 and 30 Hz. Finally,
free carboxyl groups were blocked by a 50 μL injection of 1
M ethanolamine pH 8.5.

The adsorption of PTH at 20 °C were
acquired by 35 μL of PTH injections (4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14,
17, and 20 μg/mL) at a flow rate of 25 μL/min, following
dissociation for 510 s. Blank injections were performed prior to every
analyte injection, see Figure S3 in the
Supporting Information. As a running buffer, 10 mM HEPES with 150
mM NaCl and 0.005% Tween-20, pH 7.4 was used.

Calculations
The time when the injection begins, t0, was estimated directly from the measured
sensorgrams individually by an algorithm based on fitting concavity
constrained Hermite polynomials to the association phase. The RCDs
were calculated using adaptive Finite Element triangulation.25 For fitting to the kinetic model, we used a
combination of a global Genetic Algorithm and a nonlinear least-squares
solver. The Genetic Algorithm was the MATLAB,29 Global Optimization Toolbox function “ga” with the
fitness function set to the residual norm, the population size set
to 5000, and the number of generations set to 100. The Genetic Algorithm
was run in parallel on a computer cluster with 20 calculation cores
(Intel Core i7-3770S 3.10 GHz). The nonlinear least-squares solver
was the trust region reflective algorithm,30 “lsqnonlin” in MATLAB,29 and Optimization Toolbox with the initial guess set to the parameters
found by the Genetic Algorithm.

Results and Discussion
A new four-step strategy is used here to analyze the sensor data.
The new strategy is based on a recently published improved algorithm25 for fast and reliable calculations of Rate Constant
Distributions (RCDs) from sensorgrams. An RCD is a two-dimensional
distribution of association and dissociation rate constants, which
will display heterogeneous data as a map where each local distribution
observed in the map corresponds to one interaction, see Figure 1c.

The four-step strategy
will be used, evaluated, and compared with
the conventional approach, i.e., global fitting of all sensorgrams
simultaneously.12,13 The evaluation will be carried
out on synthetic (see Figure 1a) and on three experimental biosensor (QCM) data sets representing
different kinetics (see Figures 2–4).

constants obtained by fitting a two interactions model to the sensorgrams

Proposed Strategy for Rate Constant Estimation
The
suggested four-step strategy for more reliable processing of complex
binding kinetics consists of the following four steps (see also Figure 1):

(1) Plot
a dissociation graph (cf. Figure 1b) to get the first impression of the data under investigation.
If the plot is linear, there is just one interaction and one can move
directly to step (3), otherwise continue to step (2).

(2) Calculate
RCDs for each sensorgram separately (cf. Figure 1c) to estimate the
number of interactions.

(3) Do fitting to the sensorgrams one
by one using the number of
interactions determined in step (2).

(4) Plot the determined
rate constants, remove outliers, and do
clustering of all rate constants estimated from step (3), (cf. Figure 1d).

The simplest
way to cluster the data is to set manually rough cluster
center points and then assign the rate constant pairs based on their
distance to the cluster center points. Another strategy is to use
statistical clustering tools such as hierarchical clustering or k-means.31 It should be noted
that in this strategy, in contrast to the conventional global fitting
method, there is no need to exclude sensorgrams for potentially failed
injections in the analysis. Those can be easily detected as outliers
in step (4) and removed at that stage.

In the following subsections,
we will evaluate the four-step strategy
on synthetic data sets (Figure 1) as well as three different biosensor (QCM) assays representing
slow kinetics (Figure 2), medium-slow kinetics (Figure 3), and fast kinetics (Figure 4) systems.

The Supporting Information contains
complementary information, such as model fits and residual plots,
obtained by the new strategy and the conventional global fitting approach.

Synthetic Data
In this section we are going to analyze
the new strategy using synthetic two interactions data with rate parameters
log10(ka,1) = 6.00 (M s)−1, log10(kd,1) = −2.50 s–1, log10(ka,2) = 4.50 (M s)−1, log10(kd,2) = −1.50 s–1, and Rmax,1 = 100.0 RU, Rmax,2 = 500.0 RU. The new strategy is compared to conventional
global fitting using both ideal synthetic data and synthetic data
for a deteriorating system.

First, we test an ideal system,
the sensorgrams at different analyte concentrations can be found in
the Supporting Information Figure S4a.
The corresponding dissociation graph in Figure S4b indicates that at least two interactions are needed to
describe the system. In Figure S4c the
RCDs demonstrate that we have two interactions, and Figure S4d shows the clustered rate constants estimated by
fitting to the sensorgrams one by one using a two interactions kinetic
model. The stars in Figure S4d are the
estimated rate constants using a conventional global fit routine and
the crosses indicate median rate constants for the clusters. In this
case they coincide, meaning that global fitting and the new strategy
give the same results.

It is not uncommon for experimental systems
to slowly deteriorate,
i.e., lose signal. There might be several reasons for this, e.g.,
some ligand molecules are destroyed or washed out in the regeneration
step of the biosensor chip. This is simulated in Figure 1a by using the same system
as above (vertical line indicates end of injection) but setting Rmax to 95% of the value in the previous injection.
A common reaction would be to consider the experiment failed and discard
the data set, then redo the experiment with a fresh chip, new buffers
etc.; a time-consuming and costly procedure without any guarantee
that the data will improve. However, here we will try to process the
data using our four-step strategy. In Figure 1d the estimated clustered rate constants
from the new strategy, median values indicated by crosses are seen
together with the result from conventional global fitting, indicated
by stars. In this case, the new strategy provided excellent results
but the conventional global fitting gave large errors, especially
for the second association rate constant where the correct value is
4.50 but global fitting estimated it to 6.17, see also Figure S5 and Table S1. This is because the conventional
global fitting method does not handle deteriorating systems well.
The problem was solved using our new strategy, where fitting to the
sensorgrams is done one by one.

High Affinity Complex
The interaction between human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and trastuzumab that forms
a high affinity complex was studied at 35 °C. Trastuzumab, sold
under the brand name Herceptin among others, is a monoclonal antibody
used to treat breast cancer that is HER2 receptor positive.

The measured sensorgrams are presented in Figure 2a. From the sensorgrams it is clear that
the dissociation (i.e., after the vertical line in the figure) was
very slow. However, it is hard to deduce directly from the sensorgrams
if the data originates from a single interaction or many interactions.
The dissociation graph can be used to indicate potential heterogeneity,
see Figure 2b for the
172 nM trastuzumab experiment. The graph is only slightly convex indicating
that the interaction could be heterogeneous. Using the new strategy,
we calculated the RCDs for all sensorgrams to estimate how many different
interactions are needed to accurately describe the total response
for the system, see Figure 2c for the RCD for a 14 nM injection. From the RCDs we can
identify a major interaction at log10(ka) ≈ 5.5, log10(kd) ≈ −4 as well as a minor interaction at log10(ka) ≈ 3, log10(kd) ≈ −1.5. Because of
this observation, the sensorgrams were fitted to a two-site model
one by one. In Figure 2d the clustered estimated rate constants are presented. The sizes
of the circle areas are proportional to the interactions contribution
to the total response, i.e., the larger the circle area the more the
interaction contributes to the total response. Inspecting the estimated
rate constants, we can identify two different clusters, corresponding
to the major and minor interaction in the RCD, see Figure 2c. The estimated rate constants
for the minor interactions are much more scattered compared to the
major interactions. Minor interaction contributes very little to the
overall response and is therefore very sensitive to system noise.

We compared simultaneously the result above with conventional global
fitting to all sensorgrams; using one- and two-interaction model see Figure S6 and Table S2, respectively. As expected,
we see that the fit becomes better if a two interactions model is
used. However, this does not necessarily prove it to be more appropriate
as the estimated dissociation rate constant for the first interaction
is unrealistically small (log10kd = −21.2) and has extremely large error bounds. Therefore,
the conclusion from global fitting is that it is probably more appropriate
to use a single interaction model. For this interaction we get similar
results from the new strategy and global fitting, log10KD = −9.42 and log10KD = −9.18 respectively.

The advantage of using the new strategy was that we could observe
that at least two interactions are necessary to give accurate description
for the system. We also successfully resolved two different interactions
using the new strategy, whereas the conventional global fitting was
only able to resolve one, since the two interactions model gave an
unrealistic dissociation constant.

Medium High Affinity Complex
The interaction of VLDL
and IDL with anti-apoB-100 monoclonal antibody at 25 °C was investigated.
VLDLs and IDLs are involved in conversion to Low-Density Lipoprotein
(LDL),32 that is responsible for initiation
of atherosclerosis.33 Since these lipoproteins
contain apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100), anti-apoB-100 Mab can be
used to study IDL-VLDL mixture interactions.

From the sensorgrams
of Figure 3a it is
clear that the dissociation (after the vertical line in the figure)
was moderately slow. To analyze the heterogeneity, dissociation graphs
in Figure 3b for the
215 nM IDL-VLDL-anti-apoB-100 experiment, was plotted. The graphs
are slightly convex, indicating that the interaction could be heterogeneous.
From the RCD for the 20 nM injection (Figure 3c) we can identify two different interactions
both with log10(ka) ≈
5.5 and with log10(kd) ≈
−4, log10(kd) ≈
−1.5. We therefore fitted a two-site model to all sensorgrams
one by one. From the estimated rate constants, seen in Figure 3d, two distinct clusters can
be identified. The first at log10(kd) ≈ −3.1, log10(ka) ≈ 5.8, with a small cluster distribution, and
the second at log10(kd) ≈
−1.4, log10(ka) ≈
3.6, with a broader cluster distribution.

By inspecting the
data, we see that the experimental system is
deteriorating in a similar way as the synthetic data in Figure 1a. We can therefore suspect
that global fitting might give erroneous rate constant estimation.
To compare the result with the conventional way of analyzing the data,
all the sensor data was simultaneously fitted to one- and two- interactions
model, see Figure S7 and Table S3. Here
the results are almost the same as for the new strategy for the first
interaction. However, if a two interactions model was used, the results
for the second interactions deviate strongly, giving log10(ka) 3.57 with the new strategy and 6.09
using global fitting, see Table S3. This
is because the conventional global fitting procedure is not able to
handle deteriorating systems.

Analyzing the global fitting result
is tricky in this case. First,
the dissociation graph is only slightly convex indicating that a linear
model could probably describe the data rather well. Second, the improvement
in model fit from one- to two- interactions model is modest. However,
the second site contribution to the total response is non-negligible,
about 7%, so probably a two-site model is more appropriate.

The advantage of using the new strategy in this case is that we
could, from the local RCD, conclude that two interactions are needed
to describe the system. In addition, there were no problem with the
deteriorating system as was the case with global fitting. Moreover,
the interpretation of the global fitting results was not as straightforward.
From the results it can be easily concluded that the system fits one
interaction model, since only minor improvement was achieved with
the two interaction model.

Low Affinity Complex
Parathyroid
hormone (PTH)-Parathyroid
Hormone Receptor (PTH1R) interaction at 20 °C was investigated.
PTH is a hormone secreted by the parathyroid glands (84 amino acid
long). PTH is important in bone remodeling by regulating the blood
calcium cation concentration.34 In this
study, synthetic PTH and PTH1R containing only the first 34 amino
acids was used. However, the in vivo and in vitro activities of synthetic PTH compared to natural
one have been shown to be similar.35

From the sensorgrams of Figure 4a it is evident that the dissociation (after the vertical
line in the figure) is fast. Observing the association phase, we see
that we probably have a fast association and a slow association, indicating
that the interaction is heterogeneous. To investigate this in more
detail, we plotted the dissociation graph, see Figure 4b for the 7286 nM PTH injection. The graph
is strongly convex, indicating clearly that the interaction is heterogeneous.
In Figure 4c, the RCD
for the 4129 nM PTH experiment demonstrates two distributions with
the same log10(ka) ≈
4 and with log10(kd) ≈
−2, log10(kd) ≈
−1. We therefore fitted a two-site model to all sensorgrams
one by one. From Figure 4d, the estimated rate constants can be seen and two distinct clusters
could be identified. The first at log10(kd) ≈ −0.9, log10(ka) ≈ 4.2, with a small cluster distribution, and
the second at log10(kd) ≈
−2.3, log10(ka) ≈
3.7, with a broader cluster distribution.

To compare the data
achieved with the conventional approach, the
sensorgrams were simultaneously fitted to one- and two- interactions
model, see Table S4. In this case, the
data fitted much better to two- interactions model (RMSEN 7.3%) compared
to one- interaction model (RMSEN 14.1%). The errors in the predicted
rate constants for the two-interactions model are also small indicating
that a good fit was found.

In this case, the new strategy (crosses
in Figure 4d) and global
fitting (stars in Figure 4d) gave more or less
the same predicted rate constants and equilibrium constant. However,
although global fitting worked in this case, the new strategy is more
robust and can handle cases where global fitting fails. Thus, from
a practical point of view the new strategy is preferred.

Conclusions
It is important that the recent technological development in the
biosensor area is accompanied by a corresponding development in the
processing of the kinetic data. To meet this requirement, we suggest
the new four-step strategy for the reliable estimation of the rate
constants from sensorgram data.

The four-step strategy is based
on our new fast Adaptive Interaction
Distribution Algorithm (AIDA). The first step is to plot dissociation
graphs in order to get an indication of the heterogeneity of the data,
i.e., if one or several interactions are present in the system. In
the second step, whenever needed, the Rate Constant Distributions
for each sensorgram are calculated with AIDA25 in order to estimate the number of interactions for an accurate
representation of the system. In the third step, fitting is done to
the sensorgrams, one by one, using a kinetic model with the number
of interactions estimated in the second step. In the fourth and final
step, the rate constants determined are clustered, and each cluster
describes an interaction present in the system.

The new four-step
strategy was evaluated and compared with the
conventional method, i.e., global fitting to all sensorgrams simultaneously.12,13 The evaluation was first done using synthetic data, where the true
rate constants were known. In order to test the ability of the new
strategy to handle experimental noise and other experimental disturbances,
the strategy was tested on three experimental biosensor (QCM) assays
with slow, moderate, and fast kinetics.

The new four-step strategy
was found to be particularly useful
when processing complex data and data from deteriorating systems,
whereas for simple and stable systems, conventional global fitting
worked as well. However, since it is difficult to predict when a system
is simple enough to suit to the conventional approach, we recommend
that the new four-step approach is preferred. This four-step approach
is applicable for any instrumental platform, not only for QCM based
biosensors but also for SPR biosensors.
