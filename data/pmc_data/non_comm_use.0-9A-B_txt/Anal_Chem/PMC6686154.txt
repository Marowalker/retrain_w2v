Protein analysis
of potential disease markers in blood is complicated
by the fact that proteins in plasma show very different abundances.
As a result, high-abundance proteins dominate the analysis, which
often render the analysis of low-abundance proteins impossible. Depleting
high-abundance proteins is one strategy to solve this problem. Here,
we present, for the first time, a very simple approach based on selective
binding of serum proteins to the surface of nanodiamonds. In our first
proof-of-principle experiments, we were able to detect, on average,
eight proteins that are present at a concentration of 1 ng/mL (instead
of 0.5 ng/mL in the control without sample preparation). Remarkably,
we detect proteins down to a concentration of 400 pg/mL after only
one simple depletion step. Among the proteins we could analyze are
also numerous disease biomarkers, including markers for multiple cancer
forms, cardiovascular diseases, or Alzheimer’s disease. Remarkably,
many of the biomarkers we find also could not be detected with a state-of-the-art
ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography column (which depletes
the 64 most-abundant serum proteins).

==== Body
It is believed that the majority
of disease markers are still unidentified, since they are among the
low-abundance proteins in plasma.1 However,
recently, several methods have been developed to deplete high-abundance
proteins from serum, thus allowing the analysis of low-abundance proteins.
For instance, there are commercially available high-pressure liquid
chromatography (HPLC) columns, which contain antibodies against high-abundance
proteins and thus retain them in the column.2−4 While initially
only a few proteins were depleted, now columns are available that
deplete several tens of proteins simultaneously. An alternative is
extraction with an organic solvent.5 Another
approach is to use nanoparticles, which bind to certain proteins.
For instance, Liu et al. used several steps of precipitation with
polyethylene glycol (PEG) for this purpose, followed by depletion
with one of the above-mentioned antibody columns.6 Large amounts of proteins have also been identified. However,
the authors used more-complex multistep protocols.7 One alternative that does not require specific antibodies
is represented by molecularly imprinted polymer particles.8 To produce these, one must imprint a polymer
with the proteins that need to be depleted. However, in order to achieve
this, one must know the proteins that should be depleted and have
them available. This issue was solved elegantly by Yang et al.;9,10 the authors imprinted with the full bovine serum. By varying the
concentration that was used for imprinting, they could tune the amount
of proteins that are adsorbed.

An alternative approach for protein
enrichment is combinatorial
peptide ligand libraries (CPLLs).11 To
produce the library, beads are coated with many different covalently
attached peptides.12 These bind different
proteins in the serum, which are thus removed from the sample. The
remaining serum is strongly depleted of all types of proteins, including
the most abundant ones. This approach does not require specific antibodies
or prior knowledge and has already been successfully applied to several
different samples with a complex proteome.13−15

However,
despite these efforts, the depletion of high-abundance
proteins still remains an issue.16 Here,
we show a simple, fast, and cost-effective method to achieve high-abundance
protein depletion. To achieve protein depletion, we use the fact that
only some proteins bind to nanodiamonds. Our approach works similarly
to CPLLs in the sense that there are particles that bind to many different
proteins. However, we have the advantage that our particles are slightly
simpler and, since there are no biomolecules attached, they are likely
more durable. A disadvantage is probably that the surface chemistry
is less complex and, thus, probably binds less proteins than the complex
surface of CPLLs.

The nanodiamonds in our experiments have traditionally
been used
as abrasive and are thus readily available commercially. They also
recently gained popularity for their magneto-optical properties17 and their use as long-term fluorescent labels,18,19 as well as their use in drug delivery.20 However, their application in depleting high-abundance proteins
from plasma is entirely new.

Materials and Methods
To eliminate
high-abundance proteins, nanodiamonds and NaCl were
added to the serum. As a result, aggregates precipitate. Since several
of the high-abundance proteins bind poorly to the diamond surface,
one can deplete them by removing the supernatant. When the protein
corona on the diamond surface is analyzed via mass spectrometry, we
find an increased number of low-abundance proteins. For a schematic
representation of the protein depletion, see Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic representation of the experiment:
First, nanodiamonds
and salts are mixed with the serum samples. Certain proteins (mostly
proteins whose biological function is binding to negatively charged
molecules) adhere to the diamonds. Analyzing proteins on the diamond
particles reveals that high-abundance proteins were successfully depleted.
At this point, loosely binding proteins, the so-called “soft
corona”, is still adhered. These proteins can be removed by
an additional washing step, which further depletes some proteins.

Materials
Throughout this article
we used nanodiamonds
with a hydrodynamic diameter of 25 nm from Microdiamant and a flakelike
structure.21 They are produced by the manufacturer
via grinding high-pressure high-temperature diamonds. Since the diamonds are acid-cleaned
their surface contains oxygen groups.22 As a result, mostly proteins with positive domains or proteins,
which, in nature, bind to negatively charged molecules, adhere to
the particles. Human plasma was donated to us from the Bischoff group
and stored at −80 °C in aliquots until use.

Sample Preparation
To achieve binding, we added nanodiamonds
(25 nm diameter from Microdiamant) and NaCl, which were previously
identified to facilitate diamond aggregation, to the serum.23 After aggregation, the samples were centrifuged
(13 200 rpm for 21 min) and the supernatant was removed. These
aggregates also contain loosely bound proteins, the so-called “soft
corona” (which was also found on other nanoparticles24−26). The samples were then either analyzed immediately or washed. To
wash the particles, the pellets were resuspended in distilled water
once and centrifuged again. Subsequently, the supernatant was removed,
leaving only the tightly bound proteins behind in the pellet, followed
by freeze-drying. The control sample was the pure serum. To prepare
the samples for mass spectrometry, they were subjected to the digesting
protocol published in ref (27). Small amounts of the freeze-dried sample (and a few microliters
of the control, respectively) were first treated with 20 μL
of freshly prepared 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in 100 mM NH4HCO3, to reduce the protein. This was followed by an incubation
step at 55–60 °C for 30 min. The alkylation of the cysteines
was achieved by adding 10 μL of iodoacetamide in 100 mM NH4HCO3 (incubation for 45 min). Subsequently, a second
treatment with DTT followed for 30 min (to remove unreacted iodoacetamide).
A trypsin digest followed by adding 20 μL of solution with 10
ng/μL trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
An overnight incubation followed at 37 °C. A cleanup using SPE
with C-18 cartridges followed, using a 70/30/0.1 acetonitrile/water/formic
acid mixture for elution.

Sample Preparation with Carbon Black
Next, we answered
whether the protein depletion is specific for diamond nanoparticles.
To this end, we prepared our samples in exactly the same way as with
FND, except the FNDs was replaced with carbon black.

Protein Analysis
The samples were analyzed via nanoLC–MS/MS
on an Ultimate 3000 system (Dionex, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) interfaced
online with a Q-ExactivePlus (Orbitrap) mass spectrometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). Peptide mixtures were loaded
onto a 5 mm × 300 μm i.d. trapping microcolumn that was
packed with C18 PepMAP100 5 μm particles (Dionex) in 2% acetonitrile
in 0.1% formic acid at the flow rate of 20 μL/min. After loading
and washing for 3 min, peptides were back-flush eluted onto a 15 cm
× 75 μm i.d. nanocolumn and packed with C18 PepMAP100 1.8
μm particles (Dionex). The following mobile phase gradient (total
run time: 75 min) was delivered at the flow rate of 300 nL/min: 2%–50%
of solvent B in 60 min; 50%–90% B in 1 min; 90% B during 13
min, and back to 2% B in 1 min (held for 15 min). Solvent A was 100:0
H2O/acetonitrile (v/v) with 0.1% formic acid, and solvent
B was 0:100 H2O/acetonitrile (v/v) with 0.1% formic acid.
Peptides were infused into the mass spectrometer via dynamic nanospray
probe (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) with a stainless steel emitter
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The typical spray voltage was 1.8
kV with no sheath and auxiliary gas flow; ion transfer tube temperature
was 275 °C. Mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent
mode. DDA cycle consisted of the survey scan within m/z 300–1650 at the Orbitrap analyzer with
target mass resolution of 70 000 (full width at half-maximum
(fwhm) at m/z 200), followed by
MS/MS fragmentations of the top 10 precursor ions. Singly charged
ions were excluded from MS/MS experiments and m/z of fragmented precursor ions were dynamically excluded
for an additional 20 s.

Data Processing
The software PEAKS
Studio version 7
(Bioinformatics Solutions, Inc., Waterloo, Canada) was applied to
the spectra generated by the Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer to
search against the protein sequence database UniProtKB/Trembl of the
UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), limited to protein sequences of Homo sapiens (a search including the entire database was
performed as well, to rule out the relevance of possible contaminations).
Searching for the fixed modification carbamidomethylation of cysteine
and the variable post-translational modifications oxidation of methionine
was done with a maximum of five post-translational modifications per
peptide at a parent mass error tolerance of 10 ppm and a fragment
mass tolerance of 0.02 Da. The false discovery rate was set at 0.1%.

From the mass spectrometry, one obtains spectral counts. These
reflect how often protein fragments are found that can be attributed
to a certain protein. However, larger proteins naturally lead to more
fragments. To compensate for this fact, one must calculate normalized
spectral counts. These give a semiquantitative measure for the (relative)
the concentration of a certain protein in the sample. The normalized
spectral counts are calculated by using the following equation:28−30 1  where NpSpCk is
the normalized percentage of spectral count (which is the number of
spectra associated with a protein) for protein k,
SpC is the spectral count identified, and MW is the molecular weight
(in daltons) of the protein k.

Waterfall plots
were created by comparing the protein lists with
the human proteome project database (HPP-DB). The concentrations in
the database reflect the current knowledge from selected references.

Results
When we precipitate proteins together with nanodiamonds
in a salt-containing
medium, we find that some of the most abundant serum proteins bind
poorly to the nanodiamonds surface. We then used liquid chromatography
coupled with mass spectrometry (LCMS) analysis to determine which
proteins can be found on the diamond surface. We typically find several
hundred proteins on our diamond surface. Figure 2 summarizes the depletion that we find for
different media.

Figure 2 Depletion of high-abundance proteins with nanodiamonds.
Compared
to the control (serum without any treatment), shown in green, the
amount of high-abundance proteins that is found by mass spectrometry
is significantly reduced when these were previously depleted with
nanodiamonds. Different media are used to precipitate protein-coated
diamonds, and the depletion is compared. Error bars are generated
from three different independent experiments and represent the standard
error of the mean.

To generate the figure,
we added the normalized spectral count
values (which give a rough estimate for the concentration) for the
five most-abundant proteins. The first bar (shown in green in Figure 2) represents the
control, where the serum was analyzed without our method. We investigated
the depletion after adding Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM),
since this is one of the most common cell culture media. In addition,
we had first found a similar depletion effect for bovine serum proteins,
which are routinely used in mammalian cell cultures.16 However, as we can see here, mainly the salt component
of the medium is responsible for the precipitation.

To determine
the optimal conditions where most low-abundance proteins
bind to the surface while high-abundance proteins remain in the supernatant,
we tested different salt concentrations. The concentrations that we
chose were near the physiological concentration of 6.9 mg/mL NaCl.
In addition to varying the salt concentration, we also investigated
the effect of washing in order to differentiate between the hard and
soft protein corona. The soft corona (before washing) contains loosely
and strongly binding proteins. The hard corona is what remains after
washing and only contains strongly binding proteins. For most cases,
we do see a small decrease in high-abundance proteins after washing.
In addition to quantifying the most abundant proteins, we were also
interested in the composition of the protein corona. Figure 3 shows which categories of
proteins we find on which sample.

Figure 3 Analyzing the proteins that are found
on the diamonds. Depending
on the sample (panels (a)–(i)), the most prominent 50% can
be assigned to different groups of proteins with different functions.
[Legend: APO, apolipoproteins; COM, complement factors; O, other;
IG, immunoglubulins; ACP, acute phase proteins; and COA, coagulation
factors.]

The categories are chosen based
on their biological function. To
make this classification, we ranked the proteins from the highest
concentration to the lowest concentration. We took into account all
proteins in the top 50%. We chose to use the top 50% here, since,
for lower-abundance proteins, these classifications are scarce or
not available at all. The groups, based on biological functions that
we could distinguish, are apolipoproteins (APO), complement factors
(COM), other (O), immunoglubulins (IG), acute phase proteins (ACP),
and coagulation factors (COA). We found large differences in the corona
composition. Whereas, in the control, the top 50% of the corona consists
of apolipoproteins, the diamond samples are more diverse. Most likely
binding to the diamond surface occurs via electronegative oxygen groups
on the diamond surface, which can interact with electropositive groups
within proteins. While we could not establish a clear relationship
between, for instance, binding and the isoelectric point of the proteins,
we do often see proteins binding whose function in biology is to bind
to electronegative structures. What we observe is similar to CPLLs,
which offer a rich surface chemistry, to which proteins can bind.
Similar to CPLLs, we also do not target a specific protein or a number
of protein (as an antibody column does) but rather deplete anything
that does not bind. Next, we compared the samples based on their ability
to detect low-abundance proteins. To this end, we used so-called “waterfall
plots”. To construct a waterfall plot, the protein lists are
compared with the database. Figure 4 shows one of these waterfall plots, which we obtained
for the best condition (serum +6.9 mg/mL NaCl + FND). The proteins
in the database are plotted in order of decreasing concentrations.
Every protein that is identified in the sample receives a blue dot.
To illustrate the improvement, a dotted line is used to indicate the
lowest concentrated protein that we could detect with the control.
The proteins below that dotted line (marked with a rectangle) are
only accessible with the diamond sample preparation step.

Figure 4 Graphical depiction
of the waterfall plot: the waterfall plot lists
all proteins, starting with the most-concentrated ones down to the
least concentrated ones. Each blue dot indictes that the protein was
found in the sample. The waterfall plot shown here is from the condition
with serum +6.9 mg/mL NaCl + nanodiamonds. The dotted green line shows
the detection limit for the control. All the proteins in the red square
are only accessible with our sample preparation method.

Most interesting for proteomics are proteins with
concentrations
of <1 ng/mL. These are challenging to analyze without specialized
sample preparation. In Figure 5, we compare how many of these low-abundance proteins one
can find with each sample preparation method. The condition with serum
+6.9 mg/mL NaCl + FND, which can reveal eight proteins, on average,
gives the best results. For instance, the control only gives 0.5 proteins,
on average.

Figure 5 Low-abundance proteins: To demonstrate the abilities of our method,
we compare the amount of proteins that were found in the samples that
are below 1 ng/mL in the original plasma sample. Error bars are generated
from three different independent experiments and represent the standard
error of the mean.

As a final assessment
of usefulness of our method, we compared
the proteins that we could identify with proteins that are already
used as biomarkers in the literature. Table 1 gives a few examples, which seemed to be
most interesting to us.

Sample Preparation with Carbon Black
Finally, we wanted
to determine if the depletion effect that we see is specific for diamond.
When diamond is replaced in the above-mentioned experiments, as shown
in Figure 6, we do
not observe any depletion effects under any conditions. This finding
indicates that the depletion of high-abundance serum proteins is indeed
a peculiarity of diamond nanoparticles (or particles that resemble
them). The main difference between carbon black and HPHT diamond is
the content of SP2 vs SP3. While carbon black contains large amounts
of SP2 (carbon black is actually more similar to graphite than it
is to diamond), HPHT diamond is almost exclusively SP3 carbon. The
consequence is that carbon black can interact with proteins via π–π
interactions (which are not available in diamond). If such groups
are exposed on the protein surface, they will interact more with carbon
black. Oxygen-containing polar groups, on the other hand, are more
prominent on the diamond surface. Since graphitic layers are (apart
from defects) saturated and give less opportunities for oxygen-containing
groups.

Figure 6 Comparison with carbon black. Compared with the control (green,
just serum), we do not observe any significant depletion for any conditions
using carbon black (blue). Also, the washing step did not improve
the situation (red). We added the FND samples for comparison and for
a positive control.

Conclusions
While
antibody-based depletion columns are generally quite expensive,
nanodiamonds are surprisingly inexpensive, since they are commercially
available mass products, which are used as abrasives. In addition,
the depletion process is just one fast and straightforward step. While
antibodies bind very specifically to a predefined target, here, we
use a less-specific approach. We believe that proteins bind to specific
groups on the diamond. Diamond particles provide a rich surface chemistry,
which provide all types of oxygen-containing groups that (similar
to a CPLL) can interact with different proteins. During our experiments,
we were able to deplete high-abundance proteins significantly. As
a result, we have access to low-abundance proteins for analysis, which
would otherwise be undetectable. With this simple method, we were
able to detect proteins down to the pg/mL range. The best results
(the highest number of low-abundance proteins) that we can achieve
were found when salt was added in physiological concentrations. With
this approach, we are able to detect several disease biomarkers, including,
among others, markers for several cancer types, cardiovascular diseases,
or kidney function.
