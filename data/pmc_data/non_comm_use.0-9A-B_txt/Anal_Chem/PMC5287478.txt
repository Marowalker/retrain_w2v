Fluorescence anisotropy
measurements of reagents compartmentalized
into individual nanoliter droplets are shown to yield high-resolution
binding curves from which precise dissociation constants (Kd) for protein–peptide interactions can
be inferred. With the current platform, four titrations can be obtained
per minute (based on ∼100 data points each), with stoichiometries
spanning more than 2 orders of magnitude and requiring only tens of
microliters of reagents. In addition to affinity measurements with
purified components, Kd values for unpurified
proteins in crude cell lysates can be obtained without prior knowledge
of the concentration of the expressed protein, so that protein purification
can be avoided. Finally, we show how a competition assay can be set
up to perform focused library screens, so that compound labeling is
not required anymore. These data demonstrate the utility of droplet
compartments for the quantitative characterization of biomolecular
interactions and establish fluorescence anisotropy imaging as a quantitative
technique in a miniaturized droplet format, which is shown to be as
reliable as its macroscopic test tube equivalent.

==== Body
Protein–ligand
interactions
interfere with, or promote, essential biological processes such as
immune recognition, signal transduction or enzyme inhibition. Their
quantitative investigation is the basis for systematic and mechanistic
analyses of biological processes and for therapeutic strategies based
on selective molecular intervention. A wide range of assays exists
to assess the strength of binding interactions, including techniques
based on fluorescence probes (e.g., lifetime,1 resonance energy transfer,2 and anisotropy3), on surface immobilization (e.g., surface plasmon
resonance, biolayer interferometry), or on calorimetry (isothermal
titration calorimetry, ITC). Each of these approaches have shortcomings:
surface immobilization may affect the properties of the molecular
binding partners (e.g., as a consequence of conformational changes
or molecular crowding);4 ITC requires large
volumes (typically hundreds of microliters) and highly concentrated
reagents, precluding its use for precious and relatively insoluble
samples.5 An attractive choice is fluorescence
anisotropy (FA) that enables measurements in homogeneous solution
(although it still requires one of the binding partners to be fluorescently
labeled).

Here we introduce a system for the evaluation of binding
interactions
by FA in nanoliter water-in-oil droplets, achieving a ∼1000-fold
decrease per assay volume (15 nL compared to typically >13 μL
used in a 384-well plate), yet circumventing some shortcomings of
the methods described above: (i) the assay read-out
is independent of signal intensity; (ii) the need
to label only one binding partner reduces the potential for interference
of the label with protein function (e.g., by blocking binding sites).
Furthermore, only a single binding partner has to be chemically conjugated
to a fluorescence reporter, greatly simplifying the complexity of
sample preparation over readouts where all binding partners have to
be labeled (e.g., in assays exploiting fluorescence resonance energy
transfer). Flow segmentation and microdroplet technology furthermore
decrease assay volumes to the nano- or even femtoliter scale and speed
up sample handling operations; they are therefore increasingly used
for high-throughput studies.6 Recent attempts
to establish fluorescence anisotropy assays in droplets7 involved the averaging the readout of thousands
of droplets to obtain signal-to-noise ratios sufficiently precise
for deriving quantitative dose–response curves. However, the
method still required the total sample volumes to be in the microliter
range. An attractive alternative approach to save reagents and increase
throughput would be to obtain a quantitative readout from a single
droplet.8 Here each droplet would correspond
to a specified ligand/target stoichiometry and the evaluation of the
binding event in each droplet would give rise to a binding curve.
We achieve this by producing a series of single droplets9 with continuously varying reagent stoichiometries
in rapid succession and implementing a highly sensitive readout system
that provides the fraction of bound vs unbound protein. The resulting
dose–response curve is the basis for the quantitative determination
of binding constants.

We explore the potential of single droplet
anisotropy measurements
for the study of structure–activity relationships for protein–protein
interactions in nanoliter volumes. Specifically, we address the interactions
of the BRC4 peptide, a reductionist model of the recombination mediator
BRCA2, with mutants of an archaeal surrogate of the recombinase RAD51.10 The protein interaction pair BRCA2/RAD51 (Figure 1A) is a potential
drug target: it is relevant for monitoring cancer progression, as
RAD51 levels are often upregulated in cancerous cells, conferring
resistance to chemotherapy.11 Inhibition
of the interaction of BRCA2 and RAD51 has the potential to sensitize
cells to DNA damage, thus potentiating cancer chemotherapies. To facilitate
drug discovery, the two binding partners have been converted into
analogues that maintain the relevant interactions (i.e., are good
functional mimics of RAD51), but for which it is easier to deconvolute
the binding interactions and thus elucidate structure–activity
relationships: (i) Eight BRC repeats have been identified
in BRCA2 as interaction partners for RAD51 and a 30–35 amino
acid peptide, corresponding to BRC repeat 4 (BRC4), has been shown
to block RAD51 activity, suggesting a role as a cancer suppressor.12 (ii) For a fragment-based drug
discovery campaign a monomeric variant, RadA-ct, was derived from
an archaeal homologue (RadA) and humanized, to facilitate measurement
of small molecule binding constants.13 RadA-ct
and its humanized variants (HumRadAs) are much more stable than RAD51,
enabling biophysical analysis of interactions and development of small
molecule inhibitors of this protein–protein interactions pair.
Here, we use a set of previously described HumRadA mutants with varying
affinity for BRC4 peptide (from nonbinding to Kd of 6 nM) as representative examples to demonstrate that binding
can be quantitatively assessed in nanolitre droplets. In addition
to the determination of Kd, our formats
for FA measurements in droplets also allow protein expression levels
to be determined, so that cell lysates rather than purified components
can be used, which simplifies preparation protocols in practical screening
efforts significantly. Finally, we demonstrate that the method has
the potential to screen libraries of competitive ligands effectively.

association in nanoliter droplets. (A) Interaction between BRC4 (in
gray) and RAD51 (of which “HumRadA” proteins are mimics;
in red). A fluorescein tag (not shown) was added to the N-terminus
of BRC4. (B) Schematic view of the titration in droplets. The droplets
are produced to set up a concentration gradient of the respective
HumRadA and are kept in sequence inside PTFE tubing (I.D. 200 μm),
so that the ratio of HumRadA to BRC4fl increases. Spatial
encoding preserves the concentration gradient: initial droplets contain
only labeled peptide (BRC4fl), while final ones have an
excess of the RAD51 analogue, i.e., [HumRadA] ≫ [BRC4fl], and thus, contain an increased proportion of HumRadA-BRC4fl complexes. The size difference between free and complexed
species results in a change in tumbling rate that can be detected
using fluorescence anisotropy. (C) Schematic view of the fluorescence
anisotropy detection system developed for affinity determination.
The microdroplet production setup includes one or four wells of a
384-well titerplate (1), containing a magnetic stirrer
(2), and 40 μL of reagent solution (BRC4fl in CHES buffer, pH 9.5, 1% w/v BSA), a syringe pump injecting a
second component (3) into the well (HumRadA premixed
with BRC4fl in CHES buffer, pH 9.5, 1% w/v BSA) and a droplet-forming
head made with a pipet tip (4) and inserted PTFE tubing
(5). This assembly produces 10–20 nL droplets
and encapsulates a concentration gradient. The PDMS microchannel device
was bonded to a coverslip bottom (7) and droplets in
the microchannel were imaged by the microscope with a syringe pump
operating in withdrawal mode that pulls that row of droplets across.
The optical setup includes a 488 nm diode laser, a linear polarizer,
a multiedge dichroic filter (DM), a lens (L1) to focus fluorescence
light on a polarization beam splitter, mirrors (M) directing signals
with parallel and perpendicular polarizations toward a lens (L2) to
generate spatially separate images on a single CCD camera chip. The
microfluidic devices featured either one or four parallel channels.
The 20× or 10× objectives of the microscope for the single
and the four channel device, respectively, and enabled the imaging
of the full width of the channels. (c.f. inset, right).

Materials and Methods
Optics
Polarization-resolved
fluorescence imaging was
performed on a Nikon TE-300 Eclipse microscope with a custom widefield
detection system. A detailed description of the applied experimental
setup can be found in ref (3). A diode laser (Cobolt, 488 nm emission wavelength) was
coupled into the microscope through a fixed polarizer for illumination.
Microscopy was performed with a multiedge band-pass dichroic mirror
(MEBP, Semrock Di01-R405/488/561/647), a band-pass emission filter
(530/43, Semrock), and a 10×, 0.3 NA or 20×, 0.5 NA objective
lens. In the detection arm, a rectangular aperture was placed in the
conjugate plane of the specimen to serve as a field stop (FS) to restrict
the field of view. This was then relayed onto an Andor iXon DV885
EMCCD camera via a polarization beamsplitter as shown in Figure 1. The beamsplitter
cube was aligned so that fluorescence polarized along the parallel
and perpendicular directions (with respect to the illumination axis)
were imaged onto separate areas of the camera. Image data were captured
as 16 bit TIF stacks using the Andor Solis software. A frame rate
of 84 Hz, with 10 ms exposure, was achieved via 8 × 8 binning
of the camera pixels. A Matlab script was written to register the
polarization-resolved images and calculate fluorescence anisotropy
on a pixelwise basis. The mean anisotropy of image regions within
the microdroplet flow cell was then obtained. Anisotropy values for
each pixel i, j were obtained by
using the following equation: 1  where I∥ and I⊥ represent the emitted
fluorescence intensity measured for the parallel and perpendicular
polarizations, respectively. The variable G represents
the ratio of the detection sensitivities of the detector and is defined
for a specimen with known anisotropy of zero in every pixel (we use
a solution of freely tumbling fluorescein dye in water) as3 2  

The G-factor as defined
above provides calibration at the detector level so that each pixel
would result in the same anisotropy value, when calculated according
to eq 1 (see SI, Figure S1). It differs from G-factors used in cuvettes or plate readers for which a sample of
known anisotropy is used to obtain absolute anisotropy values via
measurement using two laser polarizations oriented at 90° with
respect to one another.14

Fluidics
A droplet sampling system (described by Gielen
et al.15) was used to set up a concentration
gradient: 40 μL of protein in buffer were pipetted into a well
in a 384-well plate together with a stir bar (2 × 2 mm, Fisher
Scientific). The droplet maker was assembled using polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE) tubing (I.D. 200 μm, O.D. 400 μm) inserted into
a cut gel loading tip (Starlab, 200 μL round, bottom I.D. 360
μm, top I.D. 5 mm). This tip was then inserted into a polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) slab with a hole of 1 mm in diameter. A total of 10 μL
of HFE-7500 + 1% surfactant AZ2C was pipetted into the oil reservoir
(see Figure S2).16 A typical flow withdrawal rate of 3 μL/min was used to initiate
droplet generation. At this point, a second syringe pump was turned
on to continuously increase the concentration of a second component
and produce droplets of gradually increasing concentration of this
second component. Concentrations for each droplet were derived using eq S1. At the end of the titrations, droplet
formation was stopped and the sampling head immersed into an oil-containing
well of the plate. The droplet sequence was then transported through
the tubing toward the focal point of the microscope by using the withdrawal
function of the pump again. PDMS channels were fabricated by soft
lithography and bonded to thin coverslips: they allow droplets to
transition from tubing to an area where they can be imaged (see Figure S3 for designs). Thus, the chip position
did not need to be moved over time, ensuring consistent spatial registration
of measurements for all the droplets in the sequence.

Preparation
of Cell Lysates for Affinity Screens
HumRadA
proteins were produced in 20 mL cultures. After addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranosid (IPTG; 400 μM), the temperature
was reduced from previously 37 °C to 35 °C and cell cultures
were incubated for 16 h. Next, the cells were centrifuged for 5 min
at 10 000 rpm, the pellets resuspended in Luria–Bertani
broth (LB) to equal an OD600 nm of 40. 3.7 ×
109 cells (assuming an OD600 nm of 1 corresponds
to 108 cells/mL) were transferred to a fresh tube, centrifuged
(1 min, 14 000 rpm), the supernatant removed, and the pellets
stored at −80 °C.

After thawing, the cells were
lysed by resuspending the pellet in 200 μL 0.5× BugBuster
in 20 mM N-cyclohexyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (CHES), pH 9.5; containing
100 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 1% bovine
serum albumin (BSA) and the mixture incubated for 15 min at 25 °C.
The addition of BSA prevented significant leakage of BRC4fl into the oil phase (see SI, Figure S4). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (20 min at 14 000
rpm). The supernatant was diluted with 400 μL of CHES (20 mM,
pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% BSA) to reduce destabilization
of droplets by detergents in the BugBuster lysis agent. The solution
was stored at room temperature until used for the titration. Lysates
were always prepared on the day of the experiment.

MBP-BRC4 Fusion
Protein Production
The plasmid pRSFDuet2-MBP-BRC4
(KanR), encoding a C-terminal fusion of BRC4 to maltose binding protein
(MBP), bearing an N-terminal His6-tag was generously provided
by Dr. L. Pellegrini and M. Longo, Cambridge University.17 Rosetta2 (DE3) cells (CmR) were transformed
with pRSFDuet2-MBP-BRC4. A 10 mL preculture was prepared and used
to inoculate 500 mL of LB with appropriate antibiotics. After incubation
at 37 °C (200 rpm) until an OD600 of 0.6 was reached,
the cells were induced with 400 μM IPTG. After a further 5 h
at 37 °C (200 rpm) the cells were harvested. The pellet was resuspended
in 15 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.5) and stored at
−20 °C.

For protein purification, the cells were
thawed, 0.5 μL benzonase added and lysed by sonication. The
solution was centrifuged for 40 min at 6,500 rpm. The supernatant
was loaded on a Ni-NTA (Qiagen) column previously equilibrated in
PBS. The column was washed with 5 bed volumes of 10 mM imidazole,
PBS pH 7.5, and 5 bed volumes of 20 mM imidazole in PBS pH 7.5 prior
to elution with 2 bed volumes of 250 mM imidazole in PBS pH 7.5. The
protein was concentrated with 30 MWCO spin concentrators (Millipore),
while the buffer was exchanged to 20 mM CHES pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA. The purified protein was stored at 4 °C.

Results
and Discussion
Assessment of Binding Affinity by Fluorescence
Anisotropy in
a Single Droplet
Concentration gradients of one binding partner
are necessary for recording binding isotherms. To this end droplets
containing varying concentrations of purified HumRadA were generated
using a simple microcapillary technique that produces droplets of
defined concentrations in a spatially encoded sequence. To enable
FA measurements between the binding partners, the smaller component,
BRC4, was labeled at its N-terminal cysteine with fluorescein after
peptide synthesis to give BRC4fl (see SI, S13.2). While the concentration of HumRadA concentration
increased continuously, the concentration of labeled BRC4 was kept
constant (100 or 20 nM). This led to a continuously increasing anisotropy
value, because the tumbling motion of the complex is slower than that
of the individual binding partners. The readout of this series of
droplets with a varying ratio of BRC4fl and purified HumRadA
represents a “titration” of the steady-state binding
event (as schematically represented in Figure 1B).

This droplet sequence representing
a concentration gradient of HumRadA was transported through a microchannel
mounted onto the stage of an inverted microscope. The microchannel
consists of a glass coverslip (thickness 130 μm) and a bonded
rectangular PDMS channel of width 150 μm, height 220 μm,
to which the droplets were delivered via PTFE tubing inserted into
the side of the PDMS block (see Supporting Information, Figures S2B and S3). The side insertion enabled the droplets
to flow smoothly from the tubing into the channel without problems
caused by flow instabilities or separation of the confined plugs.
This is crucial to preserve the spatial encoding of sample stoichiometry.
The fluorescence anisotropy signal was read through the glass portion
of the channel chip to maintain the polarization state of the emitted
fluorescence, which would have been impossible via direct imaging
through the PTFE tubing.

Frame-by-frame recordings of parallel/perpendicular
fluorescence
intensities enabled the extraction of the total intensity and anisotropy
maps for a rectangular region of interest (ROI), as defined in Figure 2 (Videos S1 and S2, SI).

Figure 2 Anisotropy
values are extracted frame-by-frame from intensity maps
in steps A–C. The subscripts “sc” and “4c”
refer to the single channel or four parallel channel configurations,
respectively (with the latter quadrupling the throughput). (A) Raw

containing 100 nM BRC4fl. (B) Anisotropy maps calculated
from the raw data shown in (A). (C) Anisotropy histograms of a single
frame used for data quantification. For a setup with four channels,
ROIs were defined for each parallel channel. The transformation from
intensity maps into anisotropy values was achieved using a Matlab
code (https://github.com/quantitativeimaging/icetropy).

Determination of Kd Values for Protein–Protein
Interactions
The process of quantifying data from FA measurements
from individual droplets and mapping them to HumRadA concentration
is shown in Figure 3. HumRadA samples were added to BRC4fl, while keeping
the BRC4fl concentration constant. To ensure constant fluorescence
intensity, a HumRadA solution containing BRC4fl was slowly
titrated to a BRC4fl solution and droplets were generated
sequentially (see Figure 3).

Figure 3 Addition of HumRadA leads to increased anisotropy. (A) Frame-by-frame
data extraction of both total intensity (blue) and mean anisotropy
(green) for a chosen ROI (as depicted in Figure 2A). The experiment is conducted with increasing
[HumRadA] and constant [BRC4fl]. (B) Anisotropy and intensity
data corresponding to the dashed rectangle in (A). This trace corresponds
to six individual droplets passing through the field of view. Periods
of high brightness in the region of interest correspond to the presence
of a droplet. The dashed regions in (B) indicate periods when the
region of interest is filled by a droplet, during which it is typically
possible to obtain 70 frames of image data once the data are trimmed
to exclude frames where the region of interest is only partially filled
by the droplet. The anisotropy of the droplet and the measurement
uncertainty can be estimated as the mean and standard deviation of
these 70 values. (C) Anisotropy values plotted as a function of theoretical
concentration of protein in each droplet calculated from the time
when the droplet picture was taken (frame number). Vertical error
bars correspond to the standard deviation of the mean anisotropy for
each droplet. The black trace is the best fit obtained using eq 3. (D) Four dose–response
curves for HumRadA18 obtained in parallel with the four-channel device.

First, the start of each titration
was identified by the first
droplet for which fluorescence anisotropy was at least 0.5 mP above
that of droplets containing BRC4fl only (Figure 3A). Concentrations for each
droplet could be calculated analytically from the known flow parameters
(initial volume Vi, flow rates of infusion
and withdrawal, qin and qout, respectively), and the time the droplet was generated,
using eq S1. For the flow conditions used
here, minor mis-assignments of droplets and concentrations lead to
negligible errors in calculated Kd. In
practice we estimate the assignment to be precise to within 1 s, corresponding
to a potential shift in Kd, on the order
of 10%. Next, the average droplet-by-droplet anisotropy values were
extracted (Figure 3B).

Anisotropy values for the ligand alone were found to be
accurately
quantified down to 5 nM, below which the signal got too weak (Figure S5). We also found that there was a significant
effect of focal position within the droplet volume on the determination
of anisotropy values (as seen in Figure S6 of the Supporting Information), which we ascribed to the presence
of ligand at the interface oil/water with a high anisotropy contribution.
However, the difference in the measured anisotropies between the fully
bound and fully unbound scenarios was largely independent of focus
and varied by less than 5% for all conditions stated here, as seen
in Figure S7. Thus, the measurement of
the difference provides a robust readout so that initial anisotropy
values with fully unbound ligands can be subtracted from all readings.
Experiments yielded comparable results, even when microfluidic devices
were removed and replaced or between different flow-chip designs.
The standard deviation of the mean anisotropy for each frame was found
to be around 12 mP, whereas the standard deviation of the mean anisotropy
for the accumulated 70 frames corresponding to a single droplet was
around 8 mP (Figure S8). Thus, there is
no benefit to be derived from using larger droplets or using multiple
droplets containing the same concentration conditions to improve data
quality.

Kd values were subsequently
extracted
using the following equation, in which binding equilibrium is assumed.18 3  Here AC and AF are the anisotropy values for fully bound
(AC), and fully unbound (AF) states, respectively, and [HumRadAx] refers to the concentration of the respective HumRadA protein
variants.

The fit for HumRadA18 at 5 nM BRC4fl gave
a Kd of 49.3 ± 0.5 nM (Figure 3C). In an analogous HumRadA18
titration in
the parallelized setup featuring four channel device the Kd values were extracted as 52.0 ± 2.0, 55.9 ±
2.9, 49.1 ± 1.4, and 56.3 ± 3.0 nM, respectively, for a
100 nM concentration for BRC4fl. All measurements were
within the error of the fit, suggesting minimal variation between
different series of droplet concentrations and different positions
in one device.

Titrations of HumRadA Variants
Next,
three representative
HumRadA proteins with affinities between 4 and 670 nM were titrated
to demonstrate the ability of the method to rank variants. These HumRadA
mutants were designed to be increasingly similar to human RAD51 and
their affinity for BRC4 varies accordingly. Mutants HumRadA14 and
HumRadA16 lack two polar residues, which interact directly with the
BRC4 peptide. An A266R mutation in HumRadA16 introduces a salt-bridge
with BRC4 residue E1548, while the acidic side chain of residue D198
introduced in HumRadA18 reinstates a polar interaction with BRC4 residue
S1528; both of these mutations are found in HumRadA20 and HumRadA22,
explaining why the highest BRC4 affinity is expected with these proteins.

To rank the affinity of these proteins, we expressed, purified
and titrated them against pure BRC4fl. To this end, the
concentration of BRC4fl was kept constant at either 100
or 5 nM for laser powers of 5 and 50 mW, respectively.

Figure 4 summarizes
the dose–response curves obtained. As expected, at 100 nM BRC4fl, the dose–responses for HumRadA18 and HumRadA20 were
well resolved, whereas HumRadA14 exhibited a significantly higher Kd. On the other hand, reducing BRC4fl concentration and using higher laser power (50 mW) permitted a clear
differentiation between HumRadA18 and HumRadA20. The affinity of HumRadA14
was not determined at 5 nM BRC4fl because its Kd is too far from this concentration of ligand and would
result in a shallow titration for the same range of protein concentrations
with poor prospects for useful data fitting. Table 1 summarizes the Kd values obtained using a standard 96-well plate format in comparison
to the data obtained by measurements in droplets.

(A) Duplicate titrations of HumRadA 14 (red), HumRadA18 (blue), and

and 2015 ± 102 nM for HumRadA20, HumRadA18, and HumRadA14, respectively.
(B) Titrations of HumRadA18 (blue) and HumRadA20 (green) at constant
5 nM BRC4fl. Kd values were
found to be 11.0 ± 0.2 and 32.1 ± 0.4 nM for HumRadA20 and
HumRadA18, respectively.

algorithm based on a single titration.

c See curves in Figure 4a,b.

The Kd values derived from droplet
experiments are consistently around 3-fold higher than those obtained
from titer plate assays, which may indicate residual leakage of BRC4fl as well as affinity of BRC4fl for the oil–water
interface. Other oil/surfactant combinations might result in better
retention properties for BRC4fl.20Figure S4 shows that fluorescence intensity
does not plateau at 1% BSA, suggesting that we have not reached full
retention yet and further improvements are possible. However, the
ranking is entirely consistent between the droplet and the plate assay.
Moreover, it has been reported that variations in Kd values using different techniques can result in up to
1 order of magnitude discrepancy.21

Simultaneous
Determination of Protein Expression and Affinity
by Screening of Cell Lysates
In order to simplify fluorescence
anisotropy assays in droplets further, we designed an experimental
setup in which affinity determination of HumRadA variants could be
carried out without the need of purifying one of the two protein binding
partners. We first verified the assumption that cell lysate components
did not interfere with BRC4fl by varying the amount of
cell lysate not expressing any HumRadA and measuring the FA increase
(Figure S9). The FA signal was found not
to change over the course of the titration (up to 45% lysate) within
sensitivity limits for 100 nM BRC4fl and increase by 2.5
mP at 30% lysate at 20 nM, indicating little nonspecific interactions
between BRC4 and other cellular components (accounting for less than
10% of the dynamic of the assay; ∼34 mP). Instead, lysates
of E. coli cells expressing HumRadA
were directly assayed. In contrast to the purified protein sample
with a known protein concentration, two titrations have to be performed
with two distinct concentrations of BRC4fl (Figure 5A). In order to probe the potential
of lysate screenings to yield high quality Kd values, all five HumRadA variants, HumRadA14, 16, 18, 20,
and 22, were expressed and their cell lysates analyzed. A global fitting
algorithm can then be used to infer two unique linear correlations
between stock protein concentration and Kd and the intersection of these two correlations gives a unique solution
as shown in Figure 5B. Table 2 summarizes
the Kd and protein concentrations found
for all HumRadA variants (for primary data, see SI, Figure S10).

cell lysates were titrated into 100 (blue) and 20 nM (red) BRC4fl. (B) Each curve fit results in a linear relationship between
dissociation constant (Kd) and protein
concentration ([HumRadA22]lysate). The intersection of
the lines gives the only Kd and protein
concentration value that solves both line equations derived from the
titrations at 100 and 20 nM, respectively. (C) Example fits taken
along the two correlation lines of (B). Only the intersect point denoted
I gives an accurate fit for both curves ([HumRadA22]lysate = 653 ± 15 nM, Kd = 11 ± 0.5
nM).

a Conditions:
CHES 20 mM, pH 9.5,
100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% BSA, T = 24 °C. Two
titrations were performed at 100 and 20 nM ligand BRC4fl concentration, respectively, so that both Kd and expression levels were derived.

b Taken from ref (19). Kd values determined
with purified HumRadAs in microtiter plates.

c Measured by FA analysis in lysate
screens, as described in this work.

d Concentration in lysate and determined
by the lysate screen described here. Standard deviations for droplets
measurements were obtained from the global fit from one single experiment.

An immediate advantage of this
setup was that much less HumRadA
sample was necessary to perform these measurements. Because only 40
μL cell lysate was needed to obtain a full titration curve,
a cell culture of 20 mL provided sufficient material to measure Kd as well as the protein expression yield (c.f. Table 2).

The quality
of estimates of the Kd and
HumRadA concentration was found to depend on the two chosen BRC4fl concentrations that in turn determine how well the intersection
is defined. Thus, linear correlations with very similar slopes lead
to larger uncertainty. Therefore, the BRC4fl concentration
should differ sufficiently (in our case, 5-fold), and, ideally, one
concentration should be above and one below Kd. In addition, expression levels should be ideally much higher
than Kd to reach saturation of binding
conditions in order to get a good linear relationship between dissociation
constant and protein concentration, as was indeed case for [HumRadA22]lysate = 577
nM compared to
the measured Kd of 10 nM.

Despite
the huge range of expression levels spanning a 30-fold
concentration range, we obtained Kd values
similar to those measured previously.19 However, as is the case for HumRadA14, HumRadA16, and HumRadA18,
low expression or high Kd lead to higher
statistical errors (below 25%). While
HumRadA20 and 22 reverse their rank order in FA droplet assays compared
to plate assays, this is not due to insufficient data quality: a low Kd and high protein expression lead to <6%
error in Kd and concentration for these
HumRadAs. These results can be rationalized by an error that is larger
than the statistical error and which precludes the differentiation
of binders as similar as HumRadA20 and 22 (∼2-fold Kd difference). Taken together, these observations
suggest that FA measurements in droplets can produce data that match
experiments on the microliter scale and also confirm the previous
achievements of affinity enhancement of HumRadA variants by humanization
of RadA.19 Errors made are larger when
measuring affinities with Kd values substantially
below or above ligand concentration BRC4fl, because this
technique does not yield enough data points to fit the nonlinear data
adequately.

Screening for BRC4 Competitors
BRC4
derivatives have
potential as modulators of up-regulated RAD51 expression and an efficient
method to obtain structure–activity relationships for RAD51
binders would thus be highly interesting. However, producing a large
number of fluorescent peptides is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore,
we established a competition assay, which evaluates the replacement
of preincubated BRC4fl bound to HumRadA protein by unlabeled
peptide. Competition by the fusion protein MBP-BRC4 (MBP) was tested,
as shown schematically in Figure 6A. Although MBP-BRC4 does not have a higher affinity
than BRC4fl for HumRadA it will outcompete BRC4fl at high concentrations. The MBP-BRC4 concentration was gradually
increased across a sequence of droplets, while keeping the total concentration
of BRC4fl and HumRadA18 constant.

Figure 6 Competition assay performed
in nanoliter droplets. (A) Schematic
representation of the competition assay in nanoliter plugs. Both the
receptor HumRadA18 and the labeled ligand BRC4fl were kept
at constant concentration during the whole titration while the MBP-BRC4
concentration is increasing from 0 to 7 μM. (B) Competition
of MBP-BRC4 construct with BRC4fl against HumRadA18. Binding
curves were normalized to % of bound HumRadA18-BRC4fl.
Two identical repeat titrations are overlaid. The well contained initially
40 μL of 40 nM BRC4fl and 60 nM HumRadA18 in CHES
buffer pH 9.5, 1% BSA (w/v). The injection of purified MBP-BRC4 was
done at a flow rate of 2.5 μL/min (for 1 min) followed by 17.5
μL/min (for 1 min). Vertical error bars correspond to the standard
deviation of the mean anisotropy for each droplet.

The curves were plotted using eq S2 to
transform anisotropy readings into percentages of binding (Figure 6B and SI, S11). We used the framework of the complete
competitive binding model as described in reference 18. Out-competing
BRC4fl at 40 nM for HumRadA18 at 60 nM with MBP-BRC4 gives
a Kd of 110 ± 3 nM fitted to eq S3 (SI, S12).

This shows that the assay is able to quantitatively screen HumRadA18
binders with a singly labeled ligand. Even though the starting HumRadA18-BRC4fl bound fraction is below 50% to ensure efficient replacement
of BRC4fl by BRC4-MBP, the high sensitivity of the platform
is nonetheless capable of a reasonable quantification of interactions.

Summary
We demonstrate that fluorescence anisotropy can
be performed with
quantitative precision in nanoliter droplets, where each droplet encodes
for a different protein/ligand stoichiometry. Each droplet can be
analyzed individually and in rapid sequence to establish precise dose–response
curves with small sample volumes (30–1000 droplets per titration)
on very short time scales (minutes). This is in contrast to continuous
droplet flow approaches which rely on massive signal averaging over
many monoclonal droplets. Previously, it appeared to be necessary
to average signals over very large number of droplets (>10 000)7 to obtain sufficient signal with FA and for the
determination of a Kd, which meant that,
despite the small volume of one droplet, such experiments consumed
microliter total volumes (350 pL × 10 000 = 3.5 μL).
Furthermore, to provide a sufficient number of data points for construction
of a titration curve with continuous droplet flow approaches requires
labor intensive reloading of syringes, frequent adjustment periods
to equilibrate flow conditions and to ensure monodisperse droplet
formation. Finally, adjusting mixing conditions through actively controlled
variations of flow rates permits only a limited dynamic range to be
obtained, typically less than 2 orders of magnitude: the droplet-on-demand
systems in turn are able span several orders of magnitude.6c,22 Apart from device designs with classical T- or flow focusing junctions,23 the miniaturization of liquid-phase assays using
FA below microliter volumes has been demonstrated in nanoliter microwells.24 To obtain binding curves containing 10 data
points took 15 min in 48 × 48 nanoliter chamber arrays using
a commercial microfluidic device.24 The
approach was costly and required complex fluidics connections, while
still relying on manual pipetting for each concentration point screened.

By contrast, in our experimental design one set of conditions is
represented by a single droplet, so that a 200-fold reduction in reagent
volume (3.5 μL/15 nL) is possible to obtain data points of comparable
quality in a titration curve. Table 3 contrasts the quantitative descriptors of this design
with experiments in microtiter plates and with continuous analysis
of flowing droplets. Our approach achieves excellent sensitivity and
data quality through careful design of the fluidic device and calibration
of the optical anisotropy imaging platform, which incorporates an
image-based registration and G-factor calibration.3 The precise determinations of dose response curves require
minimal or no requirement for manual operator intervention. More data
points can be generated per run (>100) and the overall run time
required
to perform a full titration experiment is very short (<1 min).
The setup is relatively straightforward and can be multiplexed, as
we have demonstrated with a simple four-channel device that quadruples
the throughput. The feature of sampling droplets from an open well
brings flexibility in setting up on-demand concentration gradients,6c,22a for instance, through use of sequential injection patterns.

Using the current
implementation of the droplet sampler, the overall
volume consumed for one high-resolution titration was 40 μL
of HumRadA variant (at a concentration ideally 10 times above Kd in order to reach signal saturation), spiked
with 100 nM BRC4fl and 40 μL of pure BRC4fl (at 100 nM). Each droplet had a volume of 15 nL (compared to 13
μL needed for a standard 384-well titer plate format, ∼1000-fold
volume reduction). Such small volumes enabled the screening of cell
lysates produced in 20 mL cultures (instead of 1.3 L culture for the
equivalent titration in a 96-well screen), further reducing screening
cost and effort. We showed that extracting the two key parameters, Kd and level of protein expression, was possible
via acquisition of just two high-resolution titrations. In addition,
the FA signals from the lysates were found to be highly specific to
HumRadA-BRC4fl interactions, potentially paving the way
for diagnostic applications from more complex sample matrices (e.g.,
bodily fluids).25 The ability to determine
precise FA signals in single droplets also provides the basis for
coupling detection with library selections in formats in which droplets
cocompartmentalize genotype and phenotype.26 Anisotropy detection would expand the range of assays that can be
used for library selections in protein engineering by directed evolution27 or metagenomic screening,8c to enable not only assays that lead to production of fluorophores
(e.g., as leaving groups8b), but also,
assays that instead detect size changes by fluorescence anisotropy
(e.g., for enzymatic breakdown of macromolecular targets by proteases
of glycosidases).

Ultimately the sensitivity of the technique
is limited by the optical
setup (detector quality, laser power), but we could readily detect
low nM binders at high laser powers (50 mW) and 100 ms integration
time. The precision of anisotropy measurement (and, hence, the precision
with which binding fractions can be estimated) is limited by the fluorescence
signal from the reagents, which stray background light levels (e.g.,
light scattered from the oil droplet interfaces). In practice, this
can be achieved down to nM concentration.

Additionally, we showed
that day-to-day comparisons of FA binding
curves were possible via G-factor calibration and simple subtraction
of the “base” anisotropy values of a calibration sample
(the freely tumbling labeled ligand), without the need for further
normalizations, which have potential to introduce bias.

We established
this approach as a mature technology that was able
to rank the known affinities of HumRadAs, humanized forms of RadA,
and established a method for quickly characterizing further variants
using cell lysates. We also showed that an MBP-BRC construct can be
used to set up libraries of BRC mutants, potentially able to out-compete
the already tight-binding BRC4; a better binder would be highly valuable
for benchmarking of drug studies as well as going further toward the
understanding of BRCA2-RAD51 interactions.

The affinity determination
between a small ligand and proteins
is key to drawing structure–activity relationships. The use
of fluorescence anisotropy is highly attractive for biological experiments,
because only a single labeling step required. As we shown here, it
also enables liquid-phase assays in complex mixtures such as cell
lysates, quantifying dissociation constants from nanoliter droplets
with uncomplicated microfluidics and integration with a standard fluorescence
microscope. The technique can readily detect low nM binders. Parallelization
of the assays enables the acquisition of 50 titrations per day with
hundreds of data points each across over 2 orders of magnitude. The
number of potential targets for which FA is routinely used is vast,
ranging from the detection of interactions of small binding motifs
such as SH2 domains28 or STATs29 to the screening of small molecule drug,30 with particular advantages conferred by the
method if the samples are contained in complex solutions.31 More broadly, the rapid advances in high-throughput
biology32 and its applications, for example,
in directed evolution,27 single cell biology,
and diagnostics33 suggest a prominent future
role of quantitative single-droplet analysis based on FA.
