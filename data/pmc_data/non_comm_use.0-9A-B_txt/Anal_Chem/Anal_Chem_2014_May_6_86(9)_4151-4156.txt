The
use of fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) to measure the release
and uptake of dopamine (DA) as well as other biogenic molecules in
viable brain tissue slices has gained popularity over the last 2 decades.
Brain slices have the advantage of maintaining the functional three-dimensional
architecture of the neuronal network while also allowing researchers
to obtain multiple sets of measurements from a single animal. In this
work, we describe a simple, easy-to-fabricate perfusion device designed
to focally deliver pharmacological agents to brain slices. The device
incorporates a microfluidic channel that runs under the perfusion
bath and a microcapillary that supplies fluid from this channel up
to the slice. We measured electrically evoked DA release in brain
slices before and after the administration of two dopaminergic stimulants,
cocaine and GBR-12909. Measurements were collected at two locations,
one directly over and the other 500 μm away from the capillary
opening. Using this approach, the controlled delivery of drugs to
a confined region of the brain slice and the application of this chamber
to FSCV measurements, were demonstrated. Moreover, the consumption
of drugs was reduced to tens of microliters, which is thousands of
times less than traditional perfusion methods. We expect that this
simply fabricated device will be useful in providing spatially resolved
delivery of drugs with minimum consumption for voltammetric and electrophysiological
studies of a variety of biological tissues both in vitro and ex vivo.

Fast-scan
cyclic voltammetry
(FSCV) at carbon-fiber microelectrodes1−3 is commonly used for
the subsecond measurement of dopamine (DA) as well as other electroactive
neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in a variety of model biological
systems, including cultured cells,4−6 anesthetized and awake
rodents,7−12 and viable brain tissue slices.5,13−20 Of these systems, brain slices have the advantage of allowing investigators
to obtain measurements from multiple preparations, taken from a single
animal, while also maintaining the native three-dimensional architecture
of the neuronal tissue. Usually, the viability of these brain slices
is maintained by bathing the slices in continuously flowing oxygenated
artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) in a perfusion chamber. Although
specific conditions may differ, typical flow rates required to maintain
slice viability are on the order of 1–2 mL min–1.21

Oftentimes, it is necessary
to introduce pharmacological agents
in order to study specific mechanisms that govern neurotransmitter
release and uptake. For example, cocaine, which competitively inhibits
DA uptake22 and causes the DA reserve pool
to be mobilized,23 has frequently been
introduced to slices by switching a three-way valve from a supply
reservoir containing aCSF solution without drug to a reservoir containing
aCSF with drug. Although this method has the advantage of simplicity,
it also may have complications. First, drugs applied in this way must
be dissolved in the aCSF perfusate, which is continuously oxygenated.
These conditions may limit the ability of researchers to use compounds
that are sensitive to oxygen-rich environments. Additionally, since
dispersion and diffusion exist in the flow, the exact amount of time
for the drug to reach sufficient concentrations to act on the slice
remains unknown, and a few minutes are needed for the bath to reach
a steady state with a uniform drug concentration. The entire slice
is then treated continuously in the bath of drug, leading to a lack
of both spatial and temporal resolution when applying drugs. Moreover,
with the high flow rates required to maintain slice viability, hundreds
of milliliters of pharmacological solution could be consumed in a
single slice experiment, presenting a problem when only small quantities
of drug are available to carry out selected experiments. Thus, certain
experiments that make use of expensive drugs or custom-synthesized
compounds may be rendered cost- or time-prohibitive. Therefore, developing
a simple perfusion system that would accommodate low flow rates of
solution delivered at spatially defined locations would be useful
in such cases.

Delivery through microfluidic channels24,25 has the potential to provide good spatial resolution when applied
to a perfusion chamber. The inherent properties of using a low flow
system for this purpose have the advantage of decreasing fluid consumption
from hundreds of milliliters to just a few microliters. Additionally,
one small area of the slice could be exposed to pharmacological agents,
while another area that is analyzed in the same experiment remains
drug naive. For the conduct of FSCV experiments, such a system would
optimally apply compound from the bottom of the slice, compared to
placing microfluidic probes26,27 or pipettes28 above the slice, where the chemicals could be
diluted by the massive aCSF perfusion flow. Moreover, delivering drugs
from the bottom is preferable also because it will not interfere with
electrodes or block the microscopic view when using an upright microscope.
Such a strategy has been realized previously by attaching an add-on
bottom29 to a conventional perfusion chamber
or by fabricating the micropost array,30 injection and suction ports,31 or stencil
and microporous membrane,32 in multilayer
microfluidic devices to physically support and administer the brain
slice on the top from bottom microchannels. The construction of all
these unique devices, however, requires additional, sophisticated
photolithographic procedures. Moreover, the delivery of drugs by these
methods has been demonstrated in only a short-period (less than a
minute),29,31,32 or in a larger
rectangular area across the entire slice immersed in a laminar flow.30 Technically and ideally, the techniques developed
by Tang et al.31 and Scott et al.32 were able to deliver drugs to a slice for a
relatively long time, but they substantially relied on the stability
of two competing pump flows and the pure diffusion of chemicals. The
latter would lead to large variations in the temporal resolution,
ranging from seconds to minutes, based on the different diffusion
coefficients of drugs. Also, to our knowledge, the use of these devices
with FSCV has not been published in the literature.

Another
useful drug delivery approach is iontophoresis,33 a method that relies on the application of an
electrical current to eject charged chemical species from a micropipet
barrel. Iontophoresis has previously been combined with FSCV measurements
by using a multibarrel probe integrated with a carbon-fiber microelectrode
and fluid delivery barrels.34 This technique
is simple in that it does not involve any micromachining technologies.
Moreover, iontophoresis has the advantage of minimized tissue disruption
compared to pressure ejection.35 However,
this technique requires specialized electronic equipment to deliver
current to the barrels in order to eject chemicals. Corrections, applied
by interrogating the flow profile of electroosmotic flow (EOF) markers,
are required for accurate ejections of given amounts of drugs.34,36 In addition, by introducing an external electric field to drive
the flow, hydrogen peroxide, formed by the electrolysis of water,
may interfere with the voltammetric detection of DA.37

Herein, we introduce a simple method to make a through
hole in
a three-layer microfluidic device to pump chemicals from a bottom
channel to a brain slice in the top perfusion chamber. Our collective
approach differs from other reported microfluidic delivery chambers
in several key respects. First, since the through-hole is made of
replaceable fused silica capillary, various diameters necessary to
provide desired spatiotemporal characteristics of agent delivery can
be used. Moreover, the use of a syringe pump to deliver the microfluidic
flow eliminates the need for extra electrical sources to charge and
drive the EOF, and long periods of continuous pumping can be accommodated.
Finally, the open-face design allows an unobstructed microscopic view
and facilitates the easy manipulation of multiple electrodes to obtain
FSCV measurements of DA release and uptake. For proof of concept,
we tested our device by comparing DA release before and after the
administration of GBR-12909 and cocaine. These drugs were successfully
administered through the injection capillary, as indicated by the
change in DA release and uptake characteristics. Moreover, the ability
of this method to apply pharmacological agents at spatially resolved
points within brain slices was demonstrated.

Brain
Slice Preparation
Coronal brain slices, 300 μm
thick and having approximate dimensions of 0.8 cm (dorsal to ventral)
and 0.5 cm (lateral), were harvested from C57BL/6 mice (Charles River,
Wilmington, MA) using published procedures,18 which are described in the Supporting Information. A slice was immobilized on top of the injection capillary by a
harp slice anchor (Warner Instruments, LLC, Hamden, CT) and maintained
in the perfusion chamber (Figure 1D) with continuously
oxygenated aCSF at a flow rate of 2 mL min–1. Slices
were equilibrated for at least 60 min in the chamber prior to obtaining
electrochemical recordings.

FSCV in Brain Slices
Previously
described procedures
were used to fabricate 7 μm diameter carbon-fiber microelectrodes
(Goodfellow Cambridge Ltd., Huntingdon, U.K.).20 The following waveform was applied to the electrode every
100 ms: −0.4 V increasing to +1.0 V then decreasing to −0.4
V (versus Ag/AgCl reference electrode) at a constant scan rate of
300 V s–1. Color plots, in which cyclic voltammograms
were unfolded, stacked, and color-coded for current, were generated
for each recording. Data were sampled on each color plot at the potential
that provided the greatest DA oxidation current (∼0.6 V). The
carbon-fiber microelectrode was positioned 120 μm below the
surface of the dorsolateral striatum, between two stimulation electrodes
(Plastics One, Roanoke, VA) separated by a distance of ∼400
μm. A single, biphasic electrical stimulus pulse, with a total
duration of 4 ms and current of 350 μA, was used to evoke the
release of DA. Before applying drugs, electrically evoked DA release
was measured every 5 min until the magnitude of DA release was constant
between measurements. During drug treatment, stimulated DA release
was also measured every 5 min. After use, carbon-fiber electrodes
were calibrated by injection of a 2 μM standard solution in
a flow cell. Three of these measurements were averaged and used as
a calibration factor to calculate the concentration of DA released.

Fabrication of Perfusion Device
The tissue perfusion
device, with a microdelivery capillary, was fabricated following standard
photolithography procedures.38 The device
consists of three polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layers, which were made
by pouring the mixtures of degassed PDMS and curing agent with varying
mass ratio (mr) onto the molds with subsequent baking at 70 °C
for 1 h. The top layer (∼3 mm thick, mr = 20:1) has an opened
rectangular chamber (0.9 cm wide and 1.8 cm long) for the continuous
perfusion of aCSF. The bottom layer (∼1 mm thick, mr = 20:1)
was embossed with a channel, having cross-sectional dimensions of
500 μm wide by 160 μm deep, for introduction of pharmacological
agents to brain slices. The middle layer (∼5 mm thick, mr =
5:1) contains a through hole to connect the channel at the bottom
and the brain slice on top. A rough hole was made first by punching
the PDMS layer through with a 0.35 mm i.d. puncher (Harris Micro-Punch,
Whatman, Maidstone, U.K.). To produce a smooth inner surface of the
hole, a short fused silica capillary (360 μm o.d., 200 μm
i.d., Molex, Lisle, IL) was inserted into the rough hole. One end
of the capillary was leveled with the bottom of the middle layer (i.e.,
the roof of the bottom layer); the other end was 100–150 μm
taller than the top surface of the middle layer to support the brain
slice in the top chamber (seeing Figure 1B).
Both ends of the capillary were ground and polished on a micropipet
beveler (BV-10, Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) to make them flat
before inserting into the device. The partially cured top and middle
layers were bonded together first after another 30 min baking at 70
°C and then access holes for the channel were punched. Under
a stereo microscope, the two-layer was aligned and permanently bonded
to the bottom layer and formed the final microcapillary perfusion
device (Figure 1D). The perfusion device could
be reused by cleaning thoroughly with DI water and isopropanol after
each experiment. All the data collected in this work were obtained
using the same device.

Results and Discussion
Perfusion Device Design
and Flow Evaluation
In order
to administer pharmacological agents in a temporally- and spatially
defined manner to brain slices through the embedded capillary, it
is critical to know how long it takes the solution to travel from
the point where the drug was loaded to the opening of the injection
capillary. Here, we used a short air plug flowing ahead of the drug
to locate its front end in the microfluidic device. To prevent all
undesired fluids (e.g., aCSF and air) from entering the injection
capillary, we designed the device with a lower flow resistance from
M (as indicated in Figure 1B) to the waste
outlet (WO) than M to the outlet of the injection capillary. Therefore,
the fluid supplied prior to drug injection will preferably flow to
the WO. The hydrodynamic resistances of these two flow paths were
calculated in the Supporting Information.

To visually demonstrate the ability to introduce solutions
containing chemicals and pharmacologically active compounds into this
device, red and blue dyes were sequentially injected into the device.
The injection process is illustrated in Figure 2A–D (top view) as well as in Figure S1 (side view) and Movie
S1 in the Supporting Information. At the
beginning of the experiment, water was perfused through the top chamber
at a constant flow rate of 2 mL min–1. Next, all
of the flow paths and connecting tubes were filled with red dye. Prior
to injecting blue dye, an air plug (<1 cm in length) was introduced
into the tube in order to separate the red and blue dyes and to index
the position of blue dye flowing through the device. We also lowered
WO and left the waste vial 12 cm below the perfusion chamber to increase
the resistance from M to the capillary outlet and decrease the resistance
from M to WO. Thus, after we started the pump (CMA 402, CMA Microdialysis,
Kista, Sweden), the red dye would merge at point M with the water
flow induced by the difference of liquid (water) levels between perfusion
chamber and waste vial and lead the air plug continuing to flow in
the bottom channel, with lower resistance, directly to the waste vial
(Figure 2A–C). As the air plug passed
M, we immediately blocked the WO by applying a clamp at WO downstream
and the following blue dye was therefore being pumped to the top chamber
in about a second through the embedded capillary, which was the only
outlet remaining for the fluid inside the device to escape, as shown
in Figure 2D and Movie S1 in the Supporting Information. We defined the moment
when the blue dye was about to be injected as time zero, i.e., the
moment we blocked the WO and the air plug was immobilized. Images
in Figure 2E show blue dye diffusing in a brain
slice 5 s after injection.

flow rates are 5 μL min–1.

Delivery of DA Uptake Inhibitors through
an Embedded Capillary
Following the aforementioned flow evaluations,
we tested our device
on freshly harvested, functioning brain tissue slices. FSCV was used
to measure DA release and uptake in the slice in response to electrical
stimulation. DA release measurements were also carried out before
and after exposure to cocaine and GBR-12909 (Figure 3). Our initial results have demonstrated that DA release occurs
normally in brain slices even after 6 h in the perfusion chamber;
therefore, our device has allowed the slices to remain properly oxygenated
and viable.

Figure 3 Comparison of responses of electrically evoked DA before and after
drug administration. Dopamine release was measured at a single point
directly above the microcapillary opening. Representative color plots
(bottom) shown with current–time plots (top) sampled at the
horizontal white dashed lines on the color plots and cyclic voltammograms
(insets) sampled at the vertical white dashed lines on the color plots.
Each data set is 15 s in duration. (A) Evoked DA release at 5 min
before (left) and 5 min after (right) the administration of 5 μM
cocaine. (B) Evoked DA release at 5 min before (left) and 45 min (right)
after the administration of 1 μM GBR-12909. Single electrical
stimulus pulses were applied at 5 s. Drugs were constantly delivered
to the slices at a flow rate of 0.5 μL min–1.

To supply either cocaine or GBR-12909
to the slice, the drug was
pumped through the interior channel, thereby allowing drug to flow
through the injection capillary at the bottom of a slice after the
WO was blocked. The two drugs were separately applied to freshly harvested
brain slices while measuring stimulated DA release every 5 min. Upon
exposure to cocaine, an almost immediate increase in extracellular
DA concentration was noted. As shown in Figure 3A, a 1.86 ± 0.27-fold (n = 5) increase of DA
concentration was observed after only a 5 min treatment with 5 μM
cocaine. Two factors likely contribute to the dramatic increase in
DA levels measured after electrical stimulation: (1) inhibition of
DA clearance by competitive inhibition of the dopamine transporter22 and (2) mobilization of the DA reserve pool.23 GBR-12909 selectively inhibits DA uptake and
binds with greater affinity to the dopamine transporter than cocaine.39 Similar to the results found upon cocaine administration,
the application of GBR-12909 through the capillary resulted in a dramatic
increase of DA concentration following electrical stimulation, shown
in Figure 3B (1.93 ± 0.09-fold, n = 2). Importantly, the flow rate through the channel used
for these experiments was 0.5 μL min–1, compared
to the perfusion flow rate of 2 mL min–1. Thus,
our device is able to effectively deliver compounds in an efficient
manner, using far less quantities compared to traditional bath perfusion.

Spatially Resolved Drug Delivery
When using the traditional
bath application to treat brain slices with pharmacological agents,
a substantial amount of drug is required and the entire slice is exposed
to the drug. The latter issue presents a problem when the goal is
to study drug-exposed and drug-naive areas of the same slice. The
inner diameter of the injection capillary is small (200 μm);
therefore, it is possible in this case that the drug would affect
only a limited area of the slice around the injection spot. In order
to investigate this phenomenon, we monitored evoked DA release from
a location directly above the injection capillary (position N) and
a location 500 μm upstream of the capillary (position F). As
we observed in the inset image of Figure 4A,
right after the blue dye was injected from the capillary at a slow
rate (0.5 μL min–1), it was immediately pushed
downstream by the aCSF flow (2 mL min–1). Thus,
we anticipated the drugs delivered to the slices through the tiny
opening of the capillary would only affect a limited area around position
N and not the tissue at F upstream. These two locations were independently
tested on 10 brain slices, 5 slices for each position. Cocaine (5
μM) was continuously delivered to the slices through the injection
capillary at 0.5 μL min–1. As shown in Figure 4B, at position N, the extracellular DA concentrations
gradually increased over time under continuous exposure to the drug
through the capillary, while at position F, the DA levels remained
almost constant. Thus, this microfluidic injection method is able
to focally deliver pharmacological agents to a confined region of
brain slice without influencing the neighboring area. The attenuated
response to cocaine is no doubt a result of the negligible amount
of cocaine at point F resulting from diffusion from the injection
site as well as the drug being carried away downstream.40 Of significance, only ∼22.5 μL
of pharmacological solution was consumed in a 45 min experiment. Using
the traditional perfusion method, 45–90 mL of solution would
be required; therefore, the capillary application method represents
a 2 000–4 000-fold reduction in chemical consumption.

Two representative plots showing the changes in DA release over the
course of the administration time: left plot, detected at position
N (right on top of the injection capillary); right plot, detected
at position F (500 μm away from the capillary). These two distinct
spots on brain slices are indicated in the top insets. The snapshot

the injection capillary underneath the slice. (B) Comparison of peak
DA concentrations evoked at spots N (red triangle) and F (black square)
with continuous treatment of 5 μM cocaine feeding at 0.5 μL

between these two locations (p < 0.001, two-way
ANOVA, F1,92 = 115, n = 5).

Conclusions
In
this paper, a microfluidic capillary injection method for the
pharmacological treatment of a viable brain slice was demonstrated.
FSCV was used to measure electrically stimulated DA release before
and after drug administration at two adjacent locations on separated
slices. This method of application provided enough spatial resolution
to measure DA release in regions of the slice exposed and not exposed
to drug. Although the limits of spatial resolution were not explored,
we speculate that a higher resolution could be attained if a thinner
injection capillary (e.g., 10–50 μm i.d.) was incorporated
in this device. By using current microfluidic injection techniques,
only microliters of drug were consumed in a 45 min experiment, which
is a three-order-of-magnitude reduction in volume consumption compared
to the traditional perfusion method. This device is easily reusable
and allows the analyses of multiple slices in multiple different assays
carried out over weeks or months. Moreover, this device was intended
for use in measuring electrically evoked DA release in brain slices
by FSCV, but the open-face design is amenable to the application of
other experiments, such as electrophysiology and imaging. Additionally,
it is possible to incorporate multiple injection capillaries in order
to monitor multiple regions on single slices simultaneously or to
investigate drug interactions. This methodology could also easily
be expanded to analyze other biological tissues, further broadening
the applicability of this device for lab-on-a-chip research.41−43
