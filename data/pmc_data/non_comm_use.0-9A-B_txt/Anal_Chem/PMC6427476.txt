Gas-phase
electrophoresis employing a nano-electrospray differential
mobility analyzer (nES DMA), aka gas-phase electrophoretic mobility
molecular analyzer (nES GEMMA), enables nanoparticle separation in
the gas-phase according to their surface-dry diameter with number-based
concentration detection. Moreover, particles in the nanometer
size range can be collected after size selection on supporting materials.
It has been shown by subsequent analyses employing orthogonal methods,
for instance, microscopic or antibody-based techniques, that the surface
integrity of collected analytes remains intact. Additionally, native
nES GEMMA demonstrated its applicability for liposome characterization.
Liposomes are nanometer-sized, biodegradable, and rather labile carriers
(nanoobjects) consisting of a lipid bilayer encapsulating an aqueous
lumen. In nutritional and pharmaceutical applications, these vesicles
allow shielded, targeted transport and sustained release of bioactive
cargo material. To date, cargo quantification is based on bulk measurements
after bilayer rupture. In this context, we now compare capillary electrophoresis
and spectroscopic characterization of vesicles in solution (bulk measurements)
to the possibility of spectroscopic investigation of individual, size-separated/collected
liposomes after nES GEMMA. Surface-dried, size-selected vesicles were
collected intact on calcium fluoride (CaF2) substrates
and zinc selenide (ZnSe) prisms, respectively, for subsequent spectroscopic
investigation. Our proof-of-principle study demonstrates that the
off-line hyphenation of gas-phase electrophoresis and confocal Raman
spectroscopy allows detection of isolated, nanometer-sized soft material/objects.
Additionally, atomic force microscopy-infrared spectroscopy (AFM-IR)
as an advanced spectroscopic system was employed to access molecule-specific
information with nanoscale lateral resolution. The off-line hyphenation
of nES GEMMA and AFM-IR is introduced to enable chemical imaging of
single, i.e., individual, liposome particles.

==== Body
Since its
first appearance in
literature,1 gas-phase electrophoresis
on a nES GEMMA (nano-electrospray gas-phase electrophoretic mobility
molecular analysis) instrument has evolved to be a valuable tool for
the characterization and analysis of a great variety of materials
in the lower nanometer-size scale. nES GEMMA separates single-charged
nanoparticles obtained from a nES process with subsequent charge equilibration.
Analyte separation is based on the surface-dry nanoparticle size (electrophoretic
mobility (EM) diameter) in a high laminar flow of dried air and a
tunable electric field. By variation of the field strength, only particles
of a certain EM diameter are capable to pass the size analyzer of
the instrument toward a detector/collector. A corresponding setup
(known as well as nES DMA, MacroIMS, ES SMPS, or LiquiScan ES) has
been shown to provide information for, e.g., proteins,2,3 viruses and virus-like particles,4,5 nanoparticles,6−9 exosomes,10 and liposomes.11−13 Besides the information on surface-dry nanoparticle size with number-based
concentration particle detection in accordance with the recommendation
of the European Commission for nanoparticle analysis (2011/696/EU
from October 18, 2011), a correlation between the EM diameter and
the nanoparticle molecular weight based on well-defined standard material
can be established. This correlation enables the assessment of the
molecular weight of an analyte based on its EM diameter as was shown
by Bacher and colleagues for proteins in great detail in 2001.2 In addition, even the molecular weight determination
of larger proteinaceous complexes, for instance intact viruses, in
a size and molecular weight range not easily accessible for classical
mass spectrometric techniques5 is possible.
Conditions during the native nES process and gas-phase electrophoresis
have recently been shown to be especially favorable for larger aggregates
not even disrupting the noncovalent interactions between lectins and
glycoproteins.14

In addition, nES
GEMMA offers a size-selection step enabling the
collection of nanoparticles of a defined size on flat surfaces for
subsequent analysis via orthogonal methods. Electron microscopy of
size-selected analytes was demonstrated, e.g., by Kallinger et al.8 for silver nanoparticles and by Allmaier et al.15 for tobacco mosaic virus. Likewise, atomic force
microscopy (AFM) was successfully applied.16 Furthermore, Havlik et al.16 as well
as Engel at al.14 coupled nES GEMMA size
separation off-line with dot blot analysis. Hence, it was demonstrated
that nanoparticles remained identifiable for corresponding antibodies
after gas-phase electrophoresis, proving that the surface structure
of collected species was still intact after collection. Holder and
Marr showed that silver nanoparticles can be directly sampled to cultured
cells for subsequent cytotoxicity experiments.17

We now focus on the combination of nES GEMMA with
spectroscopic
techniques to gain additional, molecule-specific information on size-separated
material in the nanometer-size range. Specifically, we use Raman and
mid-infrared spectroscopy to perform chemical imaging of liposomes.
In the methods, spectral features are evoked by molecular vibrations
and can be assigned to specific functional groups. The spectrum represents
the chemical fingerprint of the analyte, which is accessed in a direct,
noninvasive way, providing information on chemical bonds as well as
spatial arrangement and chemical interaction of molecules with the
possibility of quantification.

Signal generation in Raman spectroscopy
is based on an inelastic
scattering process, i.e., the sample is illuminated with a short wavelength
(VIS or NIR) light source and the light scattered off the sample contains
additional wavelengths that are due to interaction with the sample.
Given the short wavelength and using a confocal microscope, it should
be possible to push the lateral resolution of Raman low enough to
allow imaging of individual liposomes (here ∼100 nm).

In contrast, infrared spectroscopy is based on an absorption process
performed at wavelengths between 400 and 4000 cm–1 (mid-IR). The spatial resolution achievable with far-field mid-IR
spectroscopy is diffraction-limited at 2–5 μm.18,19 To achieve spatial resolution on the single-liposome scale, we employ
a near-field detection technique based on photothermal induced resonance
in an AFM cantilever. In short, the sample placed in an AFM is illuminated
by a pulsed tunable infrared laser. Absorption of infrared radiation
leads to rapid, local expansion of the absorber, which is transduced
as a damped oscillation by the AFM cantilever positioned above the
sample. This technique—called AFM-IR or photothermal induced
resonance (PTIR)—has been demonstrated to give similar infrared
spectra as far-field infrared spectroscopy, but with spatial resolutions
down to 20 nm.18,20 Increased signal sensitivity
can be achieved using resonance-enhanced AFM-IR. Here, the repetition
rate of the laser is set according to the frequency of the contact
resonance of the AFM cantilever, necessitating constant tracking thereof
throughout the measurement.20,21

In our study
we selected small unilamellar liposomes as model nanoparticle
objects. These vesicles consist of a lipid bilayer encapsulating an
aqueous volume. Hence, cargo compounds can be transported either in
the lumen, the lipid bilayer, or the bilayer-associated layer according
to the cargo hydrophobicity.22 The cargo
encapsulation efficiency of vesicles is usually assessed via chromatographic23 or electrophoretic24 assays. We employed capillary electrophoresis as well as spectroscopic
bulk measurements prior to gas-phase electrophoresis to investigate
cargo encapsulation. Subsequently, vesicles were size-separated/selected
and collected on flat substrates to allow their microscopic and spectroscopic
investigation. First, employing confocal Raman microscopy, we successfully
demonstrated that Raman signals of liposomal structures collected
on CaF2 can be detected. However, facing limitations in
signal sensitivity and lateral resolution (diffraction limit), in
the second step, we opted for an advanced optical system to access
chemical-specific information on individual liposomes beyond the diffraction
limit. In our proof-of-principle study, we were able to show that
AFM-IR is a promising method for destruction-free investigation of
single, i.e., individual, nanocarriers, increasing the lateral resolution
of obtained spectroscopic images. Our work indicates that off-line
hyphenation of gas-phase electrophoresis and spectroscopy opens the
avenue for thorough in-depth investigation of soft nanoparticle material
in terms of size, shape, and chemical information. We believe that
our method of off-line hyphenation will enable investigation of size-selected
analytes from complex mixtures in the future, potentially resolving
distributions of chemicals inside isolated nanocarriers.

Materials and
Methods
Additional detailed information on applied chemicals,
liposome
preparation, and instrumentation as well as sample preparation including
AFM height maps of liposomes with different deposition methods can
be found in the Supporting Information.

Liposome
Preparation
In addition to liposomes similar
to those employed in a previous study12 (HSPC/Chol/DSPE-mPEG2000 in a 5.5:4.0:0.5 molar ratio, encapsulating
a fluorophore at 10 μM concentration in 40 mM NH4OAc, pH 8.4, from now on termed PEGylated liposomes), liposomes from
HSPC/Chol/DSPE (5.7:3.8:0.5 molar ratio) were prepared according to
the thin lipid film hydration technique.25

Instrumentation
Native nES GEMMA measurements were
carried out on a TSI, Inc., instrument (Shoreview, MN, U.S.A.). It
consists of a nES aerosol generator (model 3480) equipped with a 210Po α-particle source, a nano differential mobility analyzer
(nDMA) (model 3080) for separation, and a n-butanol-based
ultrafine condensation particle counter (CPC) (model 3025A or model
3776C) for detection. A 25 μm inner diameter, fused silica capillary
with a homemade tip26 was used for generation
of a stable Taylor cone. A fresh capillary was employed for each day
of measurement to exclude cross-contamination. Liposomes were collected
on calcium fluoride (CaF2) or zinc selenide (ZnSe) prisms
for subsequent AFM and spectroscopic imaging after particle passage
through the nDMA and applying an electrostatic nanometer aerosol
sampler (ENAS, model 3089, TSI, Inc.) at −3 to −3.1
kV and 1.5 L per minute (Lpm) air flow for 120 min at 85 nm EM diameter.

A custom-made, 3D-printed holder was designed for stable ZnSe prism
montage in the ENAS. Polylactic acid (PLA)-based fused deposition
modeling (FDM) was employed using a self-built 3D printer with a nozzle
diameter of 0.4 mm. Capillary electrophoresis was performed with an
Agilent 3D CE instrument (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany)
employing 200 mM sodium borate, pH 8.4, as background electrolyte
(BGE).

Nonencapsulated material was removed from vesicles via
spin filtration.9 On the basis of the weighed
initial liposome
amount (of a 10 μL volume) and the weighed liposome material
after buffer exchange, a 1:10 [v/v] dilution of the initial stock
(i.e., final 1 mM lipid concentration in samples) was achieved.

AFM measurements in contact mode (WITec AFM Arrow Cantilever reflex-coated:
0.2 N/m, 14 kHz) were performed of liposomes with and without encapsulated
drug deposited on either ZnSe or CaF2 substrates using
a WITec alpha 300 RSA+ confocal microscope (Ulm, Germany). The microscope
was equipped with a 20× magnification objective (Zeiss EC Epiplan,
NA 0.4, Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and an internal cantilever drive
mount. Project FIVE (WITec) and Gwyddion 2.44 software were used for
subsequent data analysis.

A WITec alpha 300 RSA+ confocal Raman
microscope equipped with
a 488 nm excitation laser (DPSS laser, <50 mW, laser class 3B)
was used for Raman imaging of liposomes. The laser was focused onto
the sample through a 100× objective (Zeiss, NA 0.9). Backscattered
photons were collected in reflection mode with the same objective,
resulting in a lateral resolution of 220 nm based on the diffraction
limit for confocal microscopes. The Stokes signal (anti-Stokes and
Rayleigh light is removed via an edge filter) is detected with a fiber
coupled spectrometer (UHTS 300 spectrometer VIS, f/4 300 mm focal
length) equipped with a 600 grooves/mm grating (blaze wavelength =
500 nm) and a highly sensitive, thermoelectrically cooled electron-multiplying
charged-coupled device (EMCCD) camera allowing a spectral resolution
of 2–3 cm–1. After nES GEMMA separation/collection
on flat CaF2 substrates (Raman grade, Crystran, Poole,
U.K.), the sample was fixed on a piezo-stage on top of a motorized
sample stage enabling a lateral positioning accuracy of <2 nm.
Balancing signal intensity and thermal stress exerted onto the sample,
Raman images were collected with a laser power of 43 mW and 1 s of
integration time covering an area of 10 × 10 μm2 with 50 nm step size in x- and y-direction. Control FOUR (WITec) software was used for data
acquisition.

Raman images were processed (see Figure 1G) using ImageLab (Epina, Pressbaum,
Austria).
First, the data matrix was reduced by selecting the spectral range
between 650 and 3290 cm–1 for each spectrum/pixel
to reduce the dimensionality of the data cube and speed up calculation
time for subsequent processing steps. After spike removal, maximum
noise fraction (MNF, noise structure: horizontal stripes) was performed
to reduce noise in the spectra. As a last step, the spectra were baseline-corrected
using Eiler’s algorithm (λ = 105, p = 0.0020, 7 iterations).27

Figure 1 CaF2 substrate was placed on top of the electrode in
the ENAS unit of the nES GEMMA instrument (A) to size-select liposomes
for Raman spectroscopy. After collection of intact liposomal nanocarriers
at 100 nm EM diameter (B), the distribution of single vesicles was
investigated via AFM height maps (C). The stability of the nES GEMMA
instrument during particle collection is demonstrated by the very
similar spectra measured prior to and after particle collection (B).
A closer look at the AFM height map indicates elliptical structures
on the substrate with a width between 200 and 250 nm and a height
of 40–45 nm (D). Raman spectra collected on (green) and between
(black) these elliptical structures show a similar spectral fingerprint
but exhibit different signal intensity with the liposome signal (green) being
significantly higher (E). The intensity distribution of the integrated
CH stretching vibration (∼2920 cm–1) depicts
similar structures as observed in the AFM height map; however, the
elliptical structures in the Raman map are blurred and measure a width
of 300–350 nm, indicating insufficient lateral resolution (F).
Data processing scheme (G).

AFM-IR measurements were performed using a NanoIR 1 system
(Anasys
Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA, U.S.A.) operated in bottom-up illumination
equipped with a pulsed tunable IR source (MIRcat, Daylight Solutions,
San Diego, CA, U.S.A.) covering the spectral range from 789 to 1763
cm–1.

AFM-IR spectra were processed using
Solo+MIA software (Eigenvector
Research, Inc., Manson, WA, U.S.A., release 8.1.1). To increase the
signal-to-noise ratio, Savitzky Golay smoothing (window size: 11,
zeroth order polynomial) was applied before cutting the data set selecting
the spectral range between 1200 and 1770 cm–1. For
better comparison, baseline-corrected spectra (Automatic Whittaker
Filter: λ = 1000, p = 0.000001) were scaled
between 0 and 1.

Results and Discussion
Within the
last few years, gas-phase electrophoresis on a native
nES GEMMA instrument evolved as a valuable analysis method for the
characterization of nanoparticle material. Especially the collection
of size-selected material for subsequent analysis employing orthogonal
methods enables in-depth nanoparticle characterization. Here, we focus
on spectroscopic techniques to gain additional, molecule-specific
information on size-separated material in the lower nanometer-size
range (i.e., below 100 nm surface-dry EM particle diameter).

Native nES
GEMMA Collection of Size-Selected Liposomes Followed
by Their Raman Spectroscopic Investigation
Following our
findings in 2016,12,13 we investigated the collection
of size-selected PEGylated liposomal vesicles on supporting materials
suitable for subsequent spectroscopic analysis. The simplest approach
for deposition of particles from suspensions on substrates would be
dropping the sample solution onto the substrate and letting it dry
in an unforced way at room temperature. This approach, however, does
not allow homogeneous particle distribution on the substrate. Furthermore,
fragile particles such as liposomes have the tendency to burst during
the drying process (see Figure S1 of the Supporting Information). nES GEMMA, besides yielding information on the
analyte size distribution and the particle number concentration, allows
collection of particles from suspension in a dry and intact form and
offers additional features such as a customizable particle distribution
density on the substrate and a size-selection step. For initial AFM
and Raman measurements, we opted for vesicles similar in lipid composition
and cargo material to those originally analyzed via nES GEMMA. Infrared
microscopy with a lateral resolution of roughly 5 μm18,19 is not applicable to spatially resolve individual PEGylated liposomes,
which are in the size range of roughly 200 nm once collected on a
substrate (see below). Therefore, because the diffraction limit is
directly proportional to the wavelength of the emitting light source,
we opted for confocal Raman spectroscopy/imaging. Corresponding laser
sources emit light in the visible region with a lateral resolution
of 220 nm for a confocal system with 488 nm laser excitation wavelength
and 100× magnification (NA = 0.9). CaF2 was used as
supporting material (Figure 1A) because it exhibits a flat baseline in the spectral region
of interest.28,29 Native nES GEMMA spectra were
collected prior to and post sample collection to check for stability
of the system (Figure 1B). Prior to spectroscopic analysis, AFM images of PEGylated liposomes
on CaF2 with a sampling diameter of 100 nm (EM diameter)
were recorded (i) to investigate the spatial distribution of the PEGylated
liposomes on the substrate and (ii) to check if PEGylated liposomes
were collected in an intact form on the substrate. Once PEGylated
liposomes are collected on the substrate, their original spherical
shape in solution changes to an ellipsoid one upon contact with the
solid sample support. A width of ∼200–250 nm and a height
in the range of 25–35 nm (Figure 1C and D) as detected via AFM lead to a particle
volume of collected vesicles similar to values obtained for liposomes
in the gas/liquid phase. Besides vesicle/substrate interaction, this
deformation also results from the force exerted by the AFM tip. Investigation
by Raman spectroscopy of the particles successfully revealed typical
bands evoked by lipids such as the CH stretching vibration at ∼2920
cm–1, the C=O stretching vibration at 1740
cm–1, or the CH2 deformation vibration
at 1440 cm–1.30 The intensity
distribution of the integrated CH stretching vibration (2821 to 3056
cm–1) as the most intense band in the Raman spectrum
(Figure 1E) indicates
that ellipsoid structures are indeed detected based on their lipid-specific
spectral fingerprint. However, (i) the structures seem blurred and
measure 300–350 nm in width, which is significantly broader
than in AFM images of the same sample. Hence, while we successfully
verify via AFM that only single liposomes are present on the substrate,
chemical differences within a single liposome cannot be measured spectroscopically
due to the diffraction limit of confocal Raman spectroscopy. Also,
(ii) a very similar spectral fingerprint—although with significantly
lower intensity—could be recorded from areas between PEGylated
liposomes (black spectrum in Figure 1E). These two observations are most likely attributed
to insufficient lateral resolution of the employed spectroscopic method.
Furthermore, (iii) the original spectra of PEGylated liposomes before
the processing steps show poor signal-to-noise ratios in the range
of 2–6 (Figure 1G). (iv) We used CaF2 as substrate for Raman spectroscopy,
even though the surface of the substrate is rough, making it less
suitable for AFM investigations. Considering that we ultimately want
to develop a method that allows detection of the encapsulated cargo
at even lower concentration compared to the lipid vesicles, Raman
spectroscopy appears not to offer this possibility in terms of signal
sensitivity and lateral resolution at the moment. Hence, we assessed
the applicability of another spectroscopic method for our purpose
and at the same time adapted the liposome system from our initial
study12,13 to a vesicle system encapsulating a chemotherapeutic
drug.

Preparation and Characterization of Drug-Loaded Liposomes
For investigation of liposomes encapsulating a pharmacologically active
compound, we opted for cytarabine—also known as cytosine arabinoside
(ara-C) or 1β-arabinofuranosylcytosine. Cytarabine, employed,
e.g., for leukemia treatment, was FDA approved already in April 1999.
Only recently, a novel combination of cytarabine and daunorubicin
in liposomes has been reported for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia
with a corresponding pharmacological investigation published in 2018.31

After preparation, liposomes were analyzed
via gas-phase electrophoresis on a nES GEMMA instrument according
to an already established protocol.12,13 Our analysis
yielded liposome preparations with vesicles of 78.4 ± 6.5 nm
surface-dry particle diameter at the peak apex and an average full
peak width of 66.9 ± 7.3 nm at half peak height (Figure 2A). Note that filling of liposomes
with cytarabine cargo had no impact on the vesicle appearance upon
nES GEMMA analysis—vesicles were prepared in the absence as
well as in the presence of 40 and 50 mM cytarabine, respectively.
Likewise, AFM data corroborates this finding (Figure 2B and C). Despite differences in obtained
nanoparticle height and width values and their respective standard
deviations (probably due to interactions of the AFM tip with
soft matter analytes, i.e., liposomes, especially for vesicles not
filled with corresponding cargo molecules), similar values for vesicle
dimensions were obtained: buffer-filled liposomes (Figure 2B) were 160 ± 59 nm in
width and 36 ± 15 nm in height (n = 20 individual
particles), whereas vesicles encapsulating cytarabine (Figure 2C) were 158 ± 26 nm in
width and 26 ± 10 nm in height (n = 21 individual
particles).

Figure 2 Native nES GEMMA data (A) of buffer-filled as well as cytarabine-encapsulating
liposomes. No significant difference between these two vesicle types
is detectable. This finding was also corroborated by AFM results in
contact mode of buffer-filled liposomes (B) as well as vesicles encapsulating
cytarabine cargo (C, preparation of vesicles in 40 mM cytarabine solution).

It is of note that, in order to
remove nonencapsulated cytarabine
from individual preparations, vesicles were subjected to spin filtration.9 Despite this purification step, still some low
EM diameter material was detectable for our preparations; this material
previously was assigned to unspecific aggregates of material employed
during the vesicle-formation process, possibly lipid micelles or similar.12,13 However, in relation to the main vesicle peak at 78.4 ± 6.5
nm EM diameter, the amount of this smaller-sized material seemed negligible
for the experiments presented in this work (note, however, that the
low EM diameter material had been shown to influence cell viability
in a previous study).12

Applying
capillary electrophoresis (CE) to such preparations after
desalting allowed us to subsequently assess the amount of the encapsulated
drug within vesicles similar to studies found in the literature.32,33 CE of cytarabine-containing vesicles after desalting did not yield
a peak for cytarabine (Figure 3A). Only after sonication, which had already been shown to
disrupt vesicles and to release the vesicle cargo as seen due to the
increase of smaller-sized sample components,13 significant amounts of the employed drug were detectable (Figure 3A). Comparing the
obtained peak area to the correlation between peak areas and sample
concentrations of cytarabine standards with known analyte concentration
(Figure 3B, at least n = 2 measurements per data point) analyzed via CE (Figure 3C) allows calculation
of the analyte concentration within vesicles based on the following
simplifications and assumptions: (i) 80 nm surface-dry liposome particle
diameter as found approximately upon native nES GEMMA analysis of
a corresponding sample (Figure 1), (ii) 10 mM overall lipid concentration based on the lipid
amount employed in the vesicle-preparation process, (iii) the molar
lipid ratio, and (iv) a phospholipid headgroup projected area of ∼0.7
nm2 for phosphatidylcholine (PC),34 0.6 nm2 for phosphatidylethanolamine (PE),35 and 0.4 nm2 for cholesterol.36 Combining these numbers, a liposome concentration
of ∼40 nM was determined. Taking into account this value as
well as the volume of corresponding spheres based on approximation
of the surface-dry particle diameter, a total liposome volume of ∼6
mL/L solution was obtained. Relating the liposome volume to the increase
of analyte concentration upon vesicle sonication (∼0.04 mM)
yielded the concentration of cytarabine inside vesicles (∼5
mM for various liposome preparations).

Figure 3 Amount of cytarabine
encapsulated in vesicles being released upon
liposome sonication (A) was determined via correlation of the analyte
concentration and the obtained peak area (B) by measurement of cytarabine
standards (C). CE with UV absorption detection at 205 nm was employed.
Peak 1 corresponds to dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) employed as internal
standard, and peak 2 corresponds to cytarabine.

In a next step, we performed bulk Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR)
measurements of liposomes encapsulating cargo molecules. Employing
a flow cell setup for transmission FTIR measurements, we successfully
identified a characteristic band (evoked by C=C and C=N
stretch vibrations37) for the detection
of cytarabine in solution at 1494 cm–1 (Figure 4A). This characteristic
band even allowed us to follow the removal of nonencapsulated cytarabine
via spin-filtration by measurement of solutions that had passed the
spin-filter membrane (Figure 4B). From the first to the second spin-filtration step (eluate
1 vs eluate 2), a significant reduction in cytarabine content of the
eluate is demonstrated, indicating that most of the nonencapsulated
cytarabine is removed in the first spin filtration step. Nevertheless,
a second washing step is necessary because cytarabine can still be
detected by transmission FTIR spectroscopy after the second spin-filtration
step, whereas no cytarabine was detectable after the third spin-filtration
(eluate 3), proving successful removal of nonencapsulated cytarabine.
This also means that any cytarabine signal detectable with FTIR spectroscopy
of liposomes after spin-filtration is most certainly evoked by cytarabine
vibrations inside the nanocarrier. Furthermore, as depicted by the
small band at 1494 cm–1 in Figure 4A, besides IR bands that can be related to
lipid building blocks, cytarabine is detectable in samples containing
vesicle-encapsulated cargo after spin-filtration. After calculating
the difference spectrum of filled and empty liposomes, the concentration
of encapsulated cytarabine can be estimated based on the area ratio
of the characteristic cytarabine band in the difference spectrum and
the FTIR spectrum of 40 mM cytarabine. Hence, a cytarabine concentration
of roughly 1 mM was determined that is in good agreement with the
results obtained by CE measurements (roughly 5 mM). However, like
CE, the application of this spectroscopic setup only allows bulk measurements;
hence, only a calculated average drug concentration per liposomal
vesicle can be obtained.

Figure 4 FTIR spectra of liposomes in plain buffer or
encapsulating cytarabine
measured in a transmission flow cell after exchange of nonencapsulated
buffer material. For comparison, the FTIR spectrum of 40 mM cytarabine
is shown. Cytarabine can be detected at 1494 cm–1 (highlighted in gray) besides signals originating from lipids (A).
Removal of nonencapsulated cytarabine during spin-filtration can be
followed by FTIR measurements (B).

To conclude, gas-phase electrophoretic analysis for collection
of size-selected cytarabine-filled vesicles in an intact form was
demonstrated. The size and shape of isolated liposomes were investigated
by AFM measurements. CE measurements confirmed that liposomes encapsulating
cytarabine were successfully prepared, which was additionally verified
by FTIR measurements. However, all these methods yielded information
on the carrier itself or bulk analysis of the chemotherapeutic drug
in general—no information on encapsulation efficiency and the
cargo content of individual nanocarriers was obtainable.

Spectroscopic
Investigation of Single Liposomal Nanocarriers
On the basis
of our Raman spectroscopy results, we wanted to improve
our method in terms of lateral resolution, signal sensitivity, and
AFM image quality. In doing so, we opted for resonance-enhanced AFM-IR
spectroscopy promising a lateral resolution of 20 nm and a signal
sensitivity that allows monolayer detection.38,39

In terms of substrate, we opted for ZnSe prisms as supporting
material due to their good spectroscopic characteristics as well as
surface smoothness necessary for AFM analysis. A ZnSe prism support
was 3D-printed, allowing for prisms to be placed into the nES GEMMA
ENAS unit. The 3D-printed support was fixed in the ENAS unit via double-sided
tape, and the ZnSe prism was placed in the printed cavity without
any additional support. An opening in the bottom of the 3D-printed
support allowed contact between the electrode of the ENAS unit and
the ZnSe prisms (Figure 5A).

Figure 5 AFM-IR spectroscopy of individual, size-selected liposomes collected
on ZnSe prisms. Application of a 3D-printed support enabled positioning
of prisms in the nES GEMMA ENAS unit (A). Liposomes were size-collected
at 85 nm EM diameter from a liposome batch with heterogeneous size
distribution. No significant differences in obtained spectra prior
to and after size collection were detected (B). Single liposomes were
selected based on the AFM height map depicting structures with a width
of ∼150 nm and a height of 45–50 nm (C). AFM-IR spectra
of individual liposomes with buffer as encapsulated cargo collected
on positions indicated by color-coded crosses (e.g., blue cross in
(C) corresponds to blue spectrum in (D)) in (C) are in good agreement
with far-field FTIR-ATR spectra (red) of the same sample system.
Typical vibrational bands such as (a) the carbonyl band at 1735 cm–1 or (b) the CH2 deformation vibration
at 1467 cm–1 evoked by lipids are marked by the
dashed gray line. Spectra are normalized and offset for clarity (D).
Tuning the laser to the carbonyl band (1735 cm–1) results in a map depicting the spatial distribution of lipids with
17.5 nm step size in x- and y-direction
(E). The lipid signal was referenced to the SiO2 cantilever
signal for reasons of better visualization. Line profiles (F) taken
from the height map of a single liposome (G) compared to the lipid
signal of the same liposome (H) outline that AFM-IR imaging provides
sufficient lateral resolution to resolve a single liposome. The scale
bar is 250 nm.

Liposomes filled with
buffer were collected at 85 nm EM diameter
on ZnSe substrates. To check for stability of the nES GEMMA system,
spectra prior to and post sampling were recorded and compared (Figure 5B). No significant
differences between these two spectra could be observed, indicating
a stable collection of particles over time.

Following ENAS collection,
AFM analysis of collected vesicles was
performed. After microscopic determination of the position of a vesicle
on the ZnSe surface (Figure 5C), AFM-IR spectra were collected of individual liposomes
with a collection diameter of roughly 100 nm (Figure 5D). Comparison of the near-field IR spectra
with far-field FTIR-ATR spectra of the identical liposomal drug-delivery
system shows that the spectra correspond well with each other. Both
methods show characteristic bands evoked by molecule-specific vibrations
of lipids such as the carbonyl band at 1735 cm–1 or the CH2 deformation vibration at 1467 cm–1 wavenumbers.40,41 Additionally, AFM-IR spectra
of the ZnSe substrate were collected on different positions between
single liposomes (Figure 5D). The average spectrum of four different measurement positions
is depicted in Figure 5D and—compared to the AFM-IR spectra of single liposomes—does
not exhibit any characteristic lipid bands. The AFM-IR map of the
lipid signal (Figure 5E and H) indicates a similar shape as the height map of the same
liposome (Figure 5C
and G). For better visualization, the lipid AFM-IR signal was referenced
to an internal standard (SiO2 signal of the cantilever
recorded at 1260 cm–1). To demonstrate the lateral
resolution that can be achieved with AFM-IR imaging, profile lines
of the height image and the lipid map of the same liposome were compared
(Figure 5F), highlighting
the ability of AFM-IR to spatially resolve an individual, single liposome.
Both maps show sharp features at the edge of the liposome and indicate
the same liposome width of roughly 200 nm.

Identical collection
and analysis steps were repeated for liposomes
filled with cytarabine. However, so far, we have not been able to
identify the encapsulated cargo based on the AFM-IR signal. This might
be improved using a different geometric arrangement in the sample-light
interaction. In the setup used in this work, the IR laser is focused
onto the sample via bottom illumination. A higher AFM-IR signal intensity
is to be expected using the top illumination arrangement, which would
allow increased signal intensity due to the possibility of plasmonic
enhancement using gold-coated tips and substrates. We concentrate
on this setup in another study.42

To conclude, we were able to collect the spectral fingerprint of
size-selected single liposomes employing AFM-IR spectroscopy. Nevertheless,
despite our advance in lateral resolution upon switching from Raman
to AFM-IR spectroscopy, we were still not able to extract spectroscopic
information on the encapsulated cargo material inside liposomal vesicles.

Conclusions
With the current work we focus on the collection
of liposomes after
size-separation on a nES GEMMA instrument on a suitable analyte support
for subsequent spectroscopic characterization. Prior to gas-phase
electrophoresis, deployed liposomes were characterized via CE, AFM,
and FTIR spectroscopy, especially concerning their encapsulated cargo
in bulk measurements. Going one step further, we intended to access
similar information but from individual nanocarriers. For this purpose,
collection of size-selected, individual liposomal vesicles followed
by spectroscopy-based identification of single nanocarriers was shown
based on the application of our native nES GEMMA/spectroscopy off-line
hyphenation.

Using Raman spectroscopy, we are able to demonstrate
spectroscopy
of individual liposomes. While the lateral resolution of confocal
Raman microscopy per se is not sufficient to resolve individual liposomes,
AFM microscopy can be used to ensure that only individual liposomes
are evaluated. The combination of native nES GEMMA with AFM-IR spectroscopy
is shown to give access to chemical information on single, nanosized
vesicles. For both techniques, further improvements can be envisioned,
such as using surface-enhanced Raman effects to improve the confocal
Raman signal or using plasmonic enhancement in top illumination for
AFM-IR.38

To conclude, native nES
GEMMA/AFM-IR spectroscopy off-line hyphenation
has been demonstrated to be a promising approach for label-free, nondestructive
investigation of nanocarriers with sufficient nanoscale lateral resolution.
We believe that, especially for drug as well as other bioactive ingredient-delivery
nanoparticles in pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food applications or
naturally occurring material, e.g., exosomes, the noninvasive characterization
of material via spectroscopic methods will yield valuable additional
information on analytes.
