The
sophisticated colors of medieval glasses arise from their transition
metal (TM) impurities and capture information about ancient glassmaking
techniques. Beyond the glass chemical composition, the TM redox is
also a key factor in the glass color, but its quantification without
any sampling is a challenge. We report a combination of nondestructive
and noninvasive quantitative analyses of the chemical composition
by particle-induced X-ray emission–particle-induced γ-ray
emission mappings and of the color and TM element speciation by optical
absorption spectroscopy performed on a red-blue-purple striped glass
from the stained glass windows of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, France,
during its restoration. These particular glass pieces must have been
produced as a single shot, which guarantees that the chemical variations
reflect the recipe in use in a specific medieval workshop. The quantitative
elemental mappings demonstrate that the colored glass parts are derived
from the same base glass, to which TMs were deliberately added. Optical
absorption spectra reveal the origin of the colors: blue from CoII, red from copper nanoparticles, and purple from MnIII. Furthermore, the derivation of the quantitative redox state of
each TM in each color shows that the contents of Fe, Cu, and Mn were
adjusted to ensure a reducing glass matrix in the red stripe or a
metastable overoxidized glass in the purple stripe. We infer that
the agility of the medieval glassmaker allowed him to master the redox
kinetics in the glass by rapid shaping and cooling to obtain a snapshot
of the thermodynamically unstable glass colors.

Stained glass
windows are among
the most impressive remnants of medieval heritage in Europe. A stunning
example of the achieved colors is the 15th century apocalypse rose
of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, France, a UNESCO World Heritage Monument
(Figure 1a). These
colors are obtained from specific transition metals (TMs).1 The glass chemical composition and the fabrication
conditions (furnace temperature and atmosphere) control the final
coloration as it depends on TM speciation (coordination number and
oxidation state). Therefore, the glass chemistry is a precious, and
sometimes unique, testimony about glass history and glassmaking technology
(origin, raw materials, and melting conditions). In particular, the
quantification of the TM redox is a unique proxy of the fabrication
process, as much additional information about the raw materials is
blurred by the melting steps.

The question is how to use present-day analytical techniques
to
determine the glass chemistry and better understand the medieval glassmaking
technologies.2,3 Only a few studies of medieval
glasses have discussed quantitatively the relation among the chemical
composition, the quantitative speciation of the coloring elements,
and the observed color. They have allowed the rediscovery of the fabrication
technique of red glasses4 or proved the
specific reducing fabrication conditions of blue glasses5 and other glasses.6−8 Quantitative chemical
analyses are crucial for building historical inferences from the comparison
between different samples. Furthermore, the preciousness of stained
glasses further requires nondestructive and noninvasive analytical
methods. This is the purpose of the Accélérateur Grand
Louvre d’Analyse Elémentaire (AGLAE) facility (Paris,
France), which is dedicated to ion beam analysis of the chemical composition
of ancient materials.9 With regard to the
determination of TM element speciation in glass, synchrotron-based
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques are the most used.5,10−13 Besides, optical absorption spectroscopy (OAS) allows colorimetric
study and provides unique information about the origin of the color,1 with the benefit of versatile portable setups.14,15 However, the OAS analysis of the color of artworks has so far been
mostly restrained to the visible energy range and to colorimetric
data. Hence, one loses crucial information in particular regarding
the contribution of FeII in the near-infrared (NIR) range,1 which serves as a proxy of the melting conditions.5,6 Recently, strong efforts were made to develop mobile optical absorption
spectroscopmeters covering the entire ultraviolet (UV)–visible–NIR
energy range and to apply OAS to the color analysis of stained glass
windows as a nondestructive and noninvasive tool.13−17 Furthermore, the derivation of quantitative information
from OAS has been a challenge and has motivated several recent studies
that compared XAS and OAS and assessed the quantitative determination
of TM speciation with OAS.5,13

In this study,
we report for the first time the combined nondestructive
and quantitative determination of (i) the glass composition and homogeneity,
using quantitative chemical mappings measured with particle-induced
X-ray emission (PIXE) and particle-induced γ-ray emission (PIGE)
at the AGLAE facility,18−20 and (ii) the glass color and TM speciation, using
OAS measured in transmission with a portable UV–visible–NIR
setup.15 We focus on a precious complex
glass from the apocalypse rose of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, made
of alternating blue, red, and purple glass stripes embedded in a colorless
base glass (Figure 1b,c). The structure of this striped glass implies that these different
colored glasses must have been melted in the same workshop and at
the same time to allow their simultaneous handling and combination:
potential differences in glass chemistry arise only from the recipes
that were used in this workshop. Hence, this glass is an ideal and
precise source of information about medieval glassmaking techniques.
Coupled PIXE–PIGE chemical mapping and OAS allowed us to determine
quantitatively the concentration and the speciation of the coloring
TM elements without dismantling the panel or sampling the glasses,
which should be avoided in general and was obviously impossible in
the case presented here. The composition standard deviations are discussed
according the glass inhomogeneities and origin. The TM concentration
variations allow us to distinguish between impurities from the raw
materials and TM added deliberately by the glassmakers to obtain each
color from the same base colorless glass. These concentrations are
used together with the OAS results and the glass thickness to calculate
the Fe, Cu, and Mn redox. We propose and discuss the recipe used for
each colored glass and the medieval glassmaking process that produced
the striped glass. The recipe used for the silver-based yellow stain
is also revealed.

Experimental Section
Stained Glasses
The glasses from this UNESCO-designated
World Heritage site show the apogee of color mastering by medieval
glassmakers. This stained glass window from the French flamboyant
gothic period was built in 1493–1498 to replace the former
degraded rose from the 13th century. It results from the most advanced
glassworking techniques: high glass quality showing little degradation
and engraved flashed colored glasses made of two or more layers of
glass that induce complex coloring effects equivalent to the details
obtained in oil painting.21 However, as
all archives were lost, neither the glass manufacturer(s) who fabricated
the glass and its geographical origin nor the glazier/artist who created
the windows by cutting, painting, and assembling the glass pieces
with a leaded frame is known. The restoration of the apocalypse rose
of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris in 2014–2015 offered a unique
opportunity to investigate the chemistry of these glasses with nondestructive
analyses. Panel T9 contains an original multicolored striped glass
from the 15th century (Figure 1b, inset). A few other similar striped glasses have been found
in the apocalypse rose and in other churches in France and Europe
(Figure S-1). This type of glass is sometimes
termed Venetian or “à-la-façon-de-Venise” by analogy with the striped glass tableware produced on
Murano island at that time.22 This one
was analyzed after careful cleaning conducted by the restorers. The
striped glass sample was studied as is, embedded in the leaded framework.
The thickness of the glass was measured using an ultrasonic thickness
gauge at the spots where the measurements were taken.

PIXE–PIGE
Chemical Composition Analysis
The
elemental composition of the striped glass was analyzed using particle-induced
X-ray emission (PIXE) and particle-induced γ-ray emission (PIGE)
techniques, which allow quantitative chemical composition analysis.
Elemental imaging capabilities have been developed at the AGLAE facility
and were used in this study to scan a total surface of 3 mm ×
19 mm from both sides of the striped glass. The 3 MeV proton beam
was focused to 40 μm on the target. The scanning system that
combined a vertical magnetic scan of the beam with a horizontal target
translation allowed acquisition of one map for each side of the panel.
One map results from a step-by-step scan, with a vertical step size
fixed to 25 μm. PIXE data were acquired with four fast counting
SDD X-ray detectors.19 One detector flushed
with He gas and protected from backscattered protons by a magnetic
deflector was dedicated to measure low-Z (major) elements. For the
measurement of trace elements, the system had three detectors to improve
the statistics, which were screened with a 50 μm thick Al absorber
to measure elements down to titanium. Lighter elements such as Na
and F were investigated by PIGE using a HPGe γ-ray detector.
With an intensity of 7 nA, the counting rates were 10–15 ×
103 counts/s in the low-energy detector and 15–40
× 103 counts/s for the trace detectors. The total
acquisition time was 3.5 h for each map. The charge was monitored
by recording silicon X-rays emitted by the Si3N4 exit window with a dedicated EDX-SDD detector. AGLAEMap software20 was used to visualize and process the raw maps.
For each pixel, two PIXE spectra corresponding to low-energy and high-energy
detectors and one PIGE spectrum were extracted. AGLAEMap software
provides the possibility of grouping pixels or selecting only part
of the initial map and thus deriving an average concentration over
a selected area. We extracted in this way the spectra corresponding
to each colored glass and base glass areas, to the yellow area, and
to the grisaille paint. Sum spectra and PIXE maps
were afterward processed using TRAUPIXE software,18,20 based upon GUPIX software,23 to obtain
the quantitative mapping of the chemical compositions of the different
glasses and of the paintings. The results of the PIXE analyses can
be affected by the variation of the chemical composition across the
sample thickness, especially in the presence of deteriorated glass
layers. Here, the excellent state of preservation of the glass, showing
very little surface corrosion, allows us to confirm that the concentration
of mobile cations such as K+ is representative of the bulk
glass. In the case of Na+, which can also be leached out
of the glass by weathering,24 it is probed
only in the first micrometers of the sample depth by PIXE. On the
other hand, PIGE allows us to probe further the bulk material, and
thus, we give the concentration derived from PIGE for Na.25 The depth of penetration depends on the chemical
composition of the analyzed material. Here in the case of the glass
presented here, it is estimated to be ∼80 μm.26 These techniques allow selection of ideal areas
without too much alteration, or paintings as well as rare glasses
pieces presenting a complex fabrication process as in the case presented
here.

Optical Absorption Spectroscopy
The optical absorption
spectroscopy measurements were achieved in parallel to the chemical
analysis on the same glass pieces, using a portable mobile setup based
on an optical fiber pathway and CCD spectrometers as described elsewhere.15 The optical absorption spectra were measured
in transmission over the 350–2500 nm energy range. The beam
size on the sample was <1 mm2 and allowed selection
of a precise spot free of surface alteration and paintings for analysis.
Optical absorption A is given by the Beer–Lambert
law: A = d∑i(ciεi), where εi (liters per mole per centimeter) is the molar extinction
coefficient of absorbing species i and d is the thickness
of the sample measured using the ultrasonic thickness gauge. The concentration
of the absorbing species, ci (moles per
liter), is obtained from chemical analysis of the glass and the density
of the glass. Density ρi (grams per cubic centimeter)
of the glass samples was estimated to be 2300 g cm–3 from model potash lime silicate glasses using the Archimedean method.
Colorimetric analysis was performed by computing the CIE values of L*, a*, and b* (unitless)
of the colorimetric system defined in 1976 by the International Commission
on Illumination. The colorimetric CIE values of L*, a*, and b* are calculated using
D65 illuminant and CIE 1931 2° observer.27L* describes the luminosity of the color (0, black;
100, white), and a* and b* describe
the color hue: a* varies from −120 (green)
to 120 (red), and b* varies from −120 (blue)
to 120 (yellow). The higher the absolute values of a* and b*, the more saturated the color.

Results
and Discussion
Chemical Compositions: Geographical Origin
of the Glass
The chemical compositions of the different parts
of the striped glass
were extracted from the PIXE and PIGE chemical mappings (Figure 2a and Table S-1). The major oxide contents (Na2O, K2O, CaO, MgO, Al2O3,
and P2O5) are very similar between the colored
stripes and the colorless base glass (Table S-1). Alkalis and alkaline-earth ions come from the plant ashes that
are added to lower the melting point of the silica of the sand.28 The low Na2O content (<1.13 wt
%) and the high CaO (>13.83 wt %) and K2O (>15.86
wt %)
contents in the base glass reveal a “potash” type glass
composition.29 These elements result from
the raw materials used to make the glass. Their respective concentrations
assess here the use of continental plant ashes made from ferns, oak,
or beech and not from coastal plants.30,31 The low PbO
concentration (<0.24 wt %) attests that the glass used here is
not lead glass, which can usually contain up to 18 wt % PbO.32 Because the three colored glasses are embedded
in the same base glass pieces, these glasses must have been melted
in the same workshop and at the same time to allow their simultaneous
handling and combination. This hypothesis is further supported by
the very close chemical compositions for the major elements. Therefore,
the comparison between the major element compositions of these glasses
should provide unique information about the variation of composition
within the same workshop over a very short time period.

mappings of the main transition metal elements on the exterior face

Standard deviations present
key information about the variation
of the chemical composition and to what extent the variation can be
interpreted in terms of a different batch recipe. Such information
is essential for arguing whether a corpus of samples belongs to the
same workshop. The calculated standard deviations of the measured
chemical compositions are listed in Table 1. We distinguish two factors that influence
these values: (i) the statistical error of the measurement defined
as the repeatability, which was determined on a reference material
(glass Brill D),33,34 and (ii) whether considering
a series of analyses on different points of a historical glass sample,
the obtained standard deviations include the statistical error and
the variation due to the heterogeneity of the sample. These standard
deviations were calculated from a series of three punctual analyses
and on a series of three submaps on the base glass. The obtained standard
deviations are larger than the statistical error. Furthermore, the
standard deviations obtained from three submaps are larger than from
punctual analyses, quantifying the relative heterogeneities of the
glass.

b After renormalization of the composition
including only the major oxides.

The base glass and the colored glasses were necessarily melted
in different pots (ceramic containers for the melted glass in the
furnace28). The variations in composition
among the base glass, the blue stripes, and the red stripes are listed
in Table 1. Although
the compositions are very similar, the calculated relative standard
deviations are larger than those due to statistical error and heterogeneities.
This suggests that a similar recipe was used for the glass for each
pot (base glass and colored glass) but that some variations occurred
probably because of errors when weighing the components. However,
we note that the relative standard deviations are small compared to
those reported for other medieval glass corpora.29 In fact, a sample corpus results usually from the collection
of various glass pieces from excavations or a window panel, with no
indication that they belong to the same workshop or were produced
at the same time. Our results suggest that the ancient fabrication
process in use in a workshop on a given day was accurate enough to
produce a relatively constant glass chemical composition in terms
of major oxides, a crucial criterion for maintaining the constant
temperature–viscosity behavior of the glass and allowing its
processing.

The chemical composition results allow us to form
three important
interpretations. (i) They confirm that all four glasses were made
in the same workshop. Similar concentrations of trace elements such
as Zr and Ti (Table S-1), within standard
deviations, suggest that all the glasses composing this striped glass
were prepared from the same raw materials. (ii) Potash-lime type chemical
composition rules out the fabrication in Venice, or “à-la-façon-de-Venise” in Northern Europe
from emigrated Venetian glassmakers. Venetian glasses were soda-rich
as they were made of soda-rich plant ashes (>10 wt % Na2O).35 On the other hand, it supports a
Northern France origin, with the use of wood ashes.29,36 (iii) A similar composition is crucial for allowing similar thermal
expansion coefficients to prevent the striped glass from breaking
when it is cooled. The chemical mappings of both sides of the glass
reveal that the colored stripes are included at the surface of the
base glass on the outdoor side as illustrated in the cross-section
scheme (Figure 2c).
The correlation between the colored glass stripes and the TM (Mn,
Fe, Co, and Cu) concentrations highlights that transition metal oxides
were added to induce the color of the respective glass batches.

In the base colorless glass, Fe and Mn are the main TM elements
(Table S-1). Iron is a common impurity
of the sand and raw materials, and the concentration measured in the
base glass agrees with the concentrations reported for other medieval
glasses.9 The optical absorption spectrum
of the base glass (Figure 3) shows a large absorption band centered at ∼10000
cm–1 assigned to FeII.1 The colorimetric L*, a*, and b* coordinates for the base glass are listed
in Table 2. The high L* value attests to the relatively high transparency of
the glass. The negative a* and positive b* values, close to zero, attest to the green-yellowish pale hue.
According to the measured glass thickness (2.17 mm, which is close
to the lower bound of observed medieval glass thickness values), the
Fe concentration (7600 ppm as total Fe2O3),
and the molar absorption coefficient of FeII at 10000 cm–1 (ε[FeII] = 25 L mol–1 cm–11), we estimate
using the Beer–Lambert law that 60% of the Fe is divalent.
Low-intensity features observed at 22000–23000 cm–1 may be assigned to MnII and FeIII, while no
MnIII is detected at 21000 cm–1.1 Although manganese can be an impurity associated
with the sand used for the glass, it is well-known from ancient (Theophilus’s
treatise37) and modern (Georges Bontemps’s
treatise38) glassmakers, and has been assessed
by successive studies,7,39 that manganese was intentionally
added to counterbalance the redox equilibrium of iron and correct
the greenish color that ferrous iron impurities give to the glass
(also known as “glassmaker’s soap”). These aspects
will be discussed further below. The blue stripe area on the chemical
mappings (Figure 2 b)
corresponds to the highest concentration of CoO (0.39 wt %) and NiO
(0.21 wt %) and a relatively high concentration of CuO (0.26 wt %)
(Table S-1). No Co–Zn–Pb–In
correlation or Co–Sb correlation was found, which rules out
the use of Co ore from Freiberg mines (Germany) or the Middle East.
Therefore, cobalt was probably intentionally added from German saffera, a cobalt-rich ore, as mentioned by ancient treatises.40 It correlates with the presence of arsenic (120
ppm), suggesting that cobalt ore was probably obtained from the mining
district of Schneeberg (Germany). The optical absorption spectrum
of the blue stripe (Figure 3) reveals the typical triple absorption band of CoII at 15500, 16770, and 18500 cm–1 in the visible
range [4A2g (4F) → 4T1g (4P), Td symmetry], confirming that the observed blue color is due
to CoII as the main coloring species.5,41 The
expected NIR triple absorption band [4A2g (4F) → 4T1g (4F)] superimposes
with the broad band identified as originating from FeII. The comparison with the spectrum of the base glass reveals that
the NIR FeII band arises mainly from the base glass contribution,
and this contribution can be subtracted from the spectrum of the blue
glass to obtain only the spectrum of the blue stripe. In the corrected
spectra from base glass absorption, it is not possible to distinguish
the contribution from either FeII ions or CuII (blue) ions,1 both expected to be around
10000 cm–1, suggesting that the contribution of
the additional Fe and Cu ions in the blue glass is negligible.5 Assuming that the maximal molar absorption coefficient
of CoII (ε[CoII]) equals 180 L mol–1 cm–1 in this potash-lime type of
glass matrix,41,42 we estimate the thickness of
the stripe to be 0.39 mm.

parts of the glass,

The highest concentration
of manganese (7.19 wt % MnO) is found
in the purple stripe (Figure 2b). An earth-abundant mineral known to be used as a source
of manganese is pyrolusite (MnO2). Here, the concentration
of manganese is correlated with the presence of barium (Figure S-2), which suggests that psilomelane
[(Ba,H2O)2Mn5O10] was
also present in the ore used as a source of manganese. However, the
very high MnO concentration in the purple glass is nonlinearly correlated
to the BaO content in the other colors. It suggests an addition from
a source of manganese different from the one used as “glassmaker’s
soap”. The optical absorption spectrum of the purple stripe
(Figure 3) shows an
intense large asymmetric absorption band around 21000 cm–1 assigned to MnIII. The spectrum corrected for the absorption
of the base glass shows that no FeII is present in the
purple stripe (Figure 3). Assuming that the thickness of the purple stripe is similar to
that calculated for the blue stripe, we estimate from the manganese
concentration that 10% of the total Mn content is in the trivalent
state (ε[MnIII] = 25 L mol–1 cm–142). The red stripe correlates
with the highest concentration of copper (1.06 wt %) (Figure 2b). The optical absorption
spectrum reveals the typical intense and abrupt absorption rise assigned
to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at 17700 cm–1 (565 nm) (Figure 3) from Cu metallic nanoparticles (NPs)1,4,43,44 and agrees with the
highly saturated red color evidenced by the high a* value. This is analogous to the gold-ruby glasses colored by gold
NP.43,45 The amount of MnO in the red stripe glass
is significantly lower (0.93 ± 0.02 wt % MnO) than in the base
and blue glasses (1.19–1.28 ± 0.05 wt % MnO) (Table S-1 and Figure S-3). These results lead
to three hypotheses. (A) Variations in the MnO content arise from
the use of different sand batches that contain different amounts of
manganese impurities. However, according to the compositions of Ti
and Zr impurities that are markers of the used sand, it is most probable
that the same sand was used for all the glasses analyzed here. (B)
The MnO concentration in the red stripe is the minimal concentration
arising from the manganese impurities contained in the sand, and the
difference with the base and blue glasses arises from a voluntary
addition by the glassmakers. (C) The MnO content in all three glasses
results from a voluntary addition by the glassmakers. This is supported
by the almost linear relation between the concentrations of MnO and
BaO in the red, blue, and base glasses. The measured variation would
result from either the empirical imprecision in the recipe or the
addition of a precise and careful amount to control the final color.

The observed colors depend on redox equilibria controlled by the
oxygen activity in the glass, which depends on the chemical composition,
temperature, partial pressure of oxygen, and TM concentrations.46 The redox equilibria can further interfere together,
and their relative reactivity in glass has been extensively investigated. Figure 4 shows the fraction
of the reduced species of a given redox couple as a function of the
partial pressure of oxygen of the furnace atmosphere. In the colorless
base glass, the presence of both Fe and Mn controls the glass color
according to the equilibrium FeII (green) + MnIII (purple) → FeIII (yellow) + MnII (colorless).
The “glassmaker’s soap” (MnIII,IV oxides,
such as pyrolusite or psilomelane) was added to shift to the right
the equilibrium mentioned above, hence removing the greenish coloration
arising from the presence of FeII. The redox estimation
for iron and manganese correlates with a partial pressure of oxygen
in the furnace atmosphere of ∼10–7 bar (Figure 4), in agreement with
values reported for medieval blue glasses.5 At this partial pressure of oxygen, Schreiber’s diagram (Figure 4) confirms that all
Mn ions are present as reduced MnII, which does not give
any color (the 3d5 high-spin ion gives no spin-allowed
optical transition possible from the 6A1g ground
state in Oh symmetry).
In the blue glass stripe, although the control of the iron redox is
not necessary because the strong CoII colorant dominates
the final color, the similar MnO content compared to that of the base
glass suggests that the same recipe as that used for the base glass
was used. The estimation of the redox state of Mn ions in the purple
glass corresponds to an effective oxidant partial pressure of oxygen
(10–1 bar) in the furnace atmosphere, which was
certainly not achieved in medieval furnaces and is incompatible with
the speciation observed in the base glass. This suggests that Mn redox
is in a metastable overoxidized state and that the exceptionally high
manganese concentration was used (i) to compensate for the presence
of FeII that reduces MnIII and therefore all
FeII has been oxidized into FeIII and (ii) to
anticipate the discoloration during the manipulation of the fused
glass due to the thermodynamic reduction to MnII toward
the equilibrium (Figure 4). The kinetics of the reduction relies on the diffusion of oxygen
in the glass and stresses the importance of rapid glass shaping and
justifies the high manganese concentration. Obtaining the ruby-red
color was another challenge for medieval glassmakers. As in the case
of gold ruby glass,43 the first stage of
the process required preparation of a glass containing monovalent
ion CuI (colorless) and then inducing the reduction of
CuI to insoluble Cu0, which precipitates as
metallic copper nanoparticles.4,43 CuI-rich
glass agrees with the partial pressure of oxygen of the base glass
(Figure 4) and is supported
by previous XANES results.10,49 The lower MnO concentration
in the red stripe than in the base glass and the other stripes confirms
that a specific glass batch with no extra oxidative Mn was added to
the red glass (Figure S-3). This supports
the hypothesis B given above. As for other medieval red glasses,4 the absence of significant amounts of reducing
elements43,46 suggests that the reduction to metallic
copper arises only from the thermodynamically favored small fraction
of metallic copper. An annealing step at a temperature slightly below
the glass transition temperature favors the diffusion of the loose
CuI ions and allows the nanoparticle growth by Oswald ripening
until it gives the red color.43,50,51

Painted Decorations
The striped glass shows, in addition
to the colored stripes, a fine yellow and black flower painting that
was achieved by the glazier who bought the glass to create the window.
This is further observed in the chemical mappings of Ag and Cu on
the outdoor side (Figure 2b,c) and Fe, Cu, and Pb on the indoor side of the glass (Figure S-4), which correlate with the flower
shape. The chemical composition of the yellow flower area differs
from the base glass composition in only the concentration of Ag (2500
ppm), which suggests that the yellow color arises from the use of
a silver-based paint and the resulting Ag absorbed into the glass
matrix. The optical absorption spectrum of the yellow stain was measured
on the collar of the angel character and is given in Figure 5. It shows an intense (1.8
au) peak at 21300 cm–1 (470 nm) assigned to the
plasmon peak resonance of metallic Ag nanoparticles.52−55 The average size of the nanoparticles can be derived from the shape
of the plasmon resonance, using56 the equation R = Vfλp2/(2πcΔλ), where R is the average radius of the metallic clusters, Vf is the Fermi velocity of the electrons in
bulk metal (for Ag, Vf = 1.39 × 108 cm s–1), λp is the peak
position of the resonance, Δλ is the full width at half-maximum
(fwhm) of the absorption band (here 90 nm), and c is the speed of light. We find that the Ag nanoparticle average
size should be between 1 and 2 nm, in agreement with previous studies.16,54 Altogether, this reveals that the yellow flower was painted on the
external face of the glass with yellow silver stain, a painting technique
developed in the 14th century. The resulting color shade and intensity
depends on the silver stain composition, and a comparison of the absorption
intensity and colorimetric values (Table 2) with previous results54 suggests that in the case presented here the stain was
made with clay (kaolinite). This agrees with one of the recipes described
in the treatise from Antoine de Pise (14th century) based on crushed
metallic silver mixed with ochre.55,57 The resulting
mixture is applied with a brush on one side of the glass. Then a firing
step induces the oxidation of silver and migration of the silver ions
in the first few micrometers of the glass.55 The clay used as a binder has little interaction with the glass
and is removed afterward. The migration of the AgI ions
in the glass is followed by immediate reduction and nucleation of
NPs, in agreement with the high redox potential of the Ag0/AgI couple and poor solubility of Ag0 in the
glass. The black stain grisaille is an opaque brown-black
vitreous painting used to make black drawings by blocking light transmission.
The chemical composition of the grisaille was extracted
from the most iron-concentrated, and thus thickest, area of the chemical
mappings (Figure S-4) to avoid interference
with the support glass composition. Iron oxide is highly concentrated
(25.56 wt % total Fe2O3), while the silica,
potassium, and calcium fractions are smaller than in the base glass
(Table S-1). We further note the important
concentration of PbO (8.5 wt %). Altogether, this composition agrees
with the recipe reported: grisaille is obtained by
grinding iron oxide and lead silicate glass.58 After firing, the resulting grisaille is a heterogeneous
layer bound to the support glass and composed of a glass matrix and
oxide inclusions as confirmed by the large standard deviations (Table S-1). The presence of paintings of the
glass attests that a last firing step was performed in the glazier
workshop to make the stained glass window. Both firing steps for yellow
silver stain and grisaille stain were performed at
similar temperatures (just below the glass transition temperature
of 630 °C59) in a furnace, which allowed
to proceed both firing simultaneously. Some cases show that grisaille and yellow silver stain were applied on the same
side of the glass.60 However, it was reported
that when clay is used in the preparation of the yellow silver stain,
then it is incompatible with the grisaille.57 This explains why the yellow silver stain and
the grisaille are painted on opposite faces of the
striped glass as illustrated in Figure 2c. The presence of the grisaille on
the indoor face of the glass agrees with usual practice reported in
glazing techniques to minimize weathering.

Glass Fabrication
Wrapping together the results obtained
on the glass chemical composition and the redox estimations, we can
infer interpretations of how this glass was made as summarized in Figure 6. First, a glass
batch was prepared from the raw materials in use in the medieval France
area, leading to a potash type composition (①). This initial
glass has a greenish color because of divalent speciation of iron
impurities in a reducing furnace atmosphere. Part of this initial
batch has probably been used to prepare the red glass (②).
The red color is obtained by adding copper. The rest of the batch
was added with “glassmaker’s soap” manganese
oxides to oxidize FeII and remove the greenish color. This
is the base glass. A small part of this colorless batch was then probably
used to make the blue and purple glass batches (③). The blue
color was obtained easily by adding cobalt ores (④). The purple
color was obtained by adding manganese ores in large amounts (⑤).
The French origin of this glass postulated according to the potash-lime
matrix composition suggests that the striped glass was blown in analogy
with double-layer flashed glasses (⑥): strings of melted colored
glass were rolled around the base colorless glass bubble attached
to a blowing cane before being blown altogether in a single shot.
The preparation of the purple and red glass batches must have been
synchronous, and the entire blowing process of the striped glass must
have been a rapid process handled by skilled glassmakers. There was
striking thermodynamic antagonism between the reduced copper red and
the oxidized manganese purple colors, while the glass was handled
and annealed under similar conditions (below ∼630 °C59), several times: after the glass had been blown
to obtain the glass sheet and then for the purpose of black grisaille and yellow silver stain (⑦). It reveals
that TM concentrations must have been precisely adjusted to allow
the colors of the stripes to be stable enough to resist other firing
steps. The stability of both colors suggests that the formation and
growth of the copper nanoparticles in the red glass are limited by
Cu diffusion in the glass,4 while the discoloration
of the purple glass is limited by the high glass viscosity around
the transition temperature.59

Conclusion
Nondestructive quantification of the TM
redox, using PIXE–PIGE
chemical mapping and optical absorption spectroscopy, allowed us for
the first time to derive quantitative TM redox information from a
complex medieval multicolored glass. These data revealed that the
manganese concentration was carefully adjusted to control the redox
processes of each color: (i) oxidation of divalent Fe to remove the
greenish color of the base glass, (ii) the absence of oxidant manganese
in the red stripe to allow the reduction of copper to metallic nanoparticles,
and (iii) an excess of oxidized manganese in the purple stripe to
obtain thermodynamically unstable trivalent manganese. Altogether,
the comparison of the Fe, Cu, and Mn redox states demonstrates how
medieval glassmakers mastered the thermodynamics and kinetics of the
redox processes in the glass via mainly TM concentrations and fast
glass shaping. Hence, this three-color striped glass appears to be
the master piece of a medieval glass workshop, which illustrates the
technical accomplishments performed at the end of the 15th century.
This work demonstrates the possibility of achieving quantitative redox
chemistry using nondestructive analytical methods in line with the
recommended ethical guidelines for cultural heritage research.
