Identification of unknown compounds
is of critical importance in
GC/MS applications (metabolomics, environmental toxin identification,
sports doping, petroleomics, and biofuel analysis, among many others)
and remains a technological challenge. Derivation of elemental composition
is the first step to determining the identity of an unknown compound
by MS, for which high accuracy mass and isotopomer distribution measurements
are critical. Here, we report on the development of a dedicated, applications-grade
GC/MS employing an Orbitrap mass analyzer, the GC/Quadrupole-Orbitrap.
Built from the basis of the benchtop Orbitrap LC/MS, the GC/Quadrupole-Orbitrap
maintains the performance characteristics of the Orbitrap, enables
quadrupole-based isolation for sensitive analyte detection, and includes
numerous analysis modalities to facilitate structural elucidation.
We detail the design and construction of the instrument, discuss its
key figures-of-merit, and demonstrate its performance for the characterization
of unknown compounds and environmental toxins.

==== Body
The success
of small molecule
analysis, especially metabolomics, by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
(GC/MS) hinges on the ability to chemically identify, through elemental
composition annotation and structural characterization, the compounds
in unknown peaks.1 As a mature analytical
technique, sample analysis workflows and postprocessing methods for
GC/MS are well-established. Nonetheless, in a single GC/MS analysis
of a complex sample, often only ∼100 of the 200–500
observed mass spectral features can routinely be identified;1−4 the rest remain unknown, along with their potential importance to
the research question being studied.

The first step to identifying
an unknown is elemental composition
derivation, where high mass accuracy is important5 but not sufficient.6 Fiehn has
shown that a simple two-step approach of (1) calculation of candidate
compositions from the mass and (2) elimination of false candidates
by comparison of empirical and theoretical isotopomer distributions
is a highly effective tool to determine elemental compositions from
high mass accuracy data.6,7 Thus, as the GC/MS field
is tasked with the analysis of complex biological and environmental
samples containing multitudinous unknowns, the demand and necessity
for state-of-the-art, high resolution and high mass accuracy instrumentation
has grown.

Despite the high impact the Orbitrap analyzer has
had in proteomics,
and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) in general, no
Orbitrap-based system dedicated to GC/MS has been developed. Recently,
we reported on a proof-of-principle modification of an electron transfer
dissociation-enabled quadrupole linear ion trap (QLT)-Orbitrap8 for GC/MS to assess the merits of the Orbitrap
as a detector for GC.9 Despite the numerous
drawbacks and crude design of this implementation, the performance
of this proof-of-principle system nonetheless suggested that a purpose-built
and optimized GC/Orbitrap instrument could serve several demanding
applications in GC/MS-based fields, especially in fields like metabolomics
that rely on the unambiguous identification of unknowns.1,7,10

Here, we introduce an Orbitrap
for GC applications, the GC/Quadrupole-Orbitrap,
which substantially improves upon the proof-of-principle system: using
a benchtop Orbitrap LC/MS11,12 as the base platform,
we have developed an applications-grade GC/MS that not only enables
high mass accuracy and high resolution analysis, but does so at scan
rates amenable to the time-scale of GC separations. The GC/Quadrupole-Orbitrap
can be used for a range of applications from trace analysis to the
structural characterization of unknown metabolites in metabolomic
analyses. Additionally, we have developed an advanced data-dependent
acquisition algorithm for MS/MS of alkylsilylated analytes, molecular
ion-directed acquisition (MIDA), which is detailed in the accompanying
article.13 Herein, we discuss the design
and construction of the instrument, detail optimization of the hardware,
electronics, and firmware, and benchmark instrument figures-of-merit.

Experimental
Section
Reagents
Unless otherwise specified, all reagents were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Methanol and water (Optima
LC/MS grade), and pyridine, methylene chloride, and iso-octane (GC/pesticide
grade) were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ). Compressed
gases (methane, helium, and nitrogen) were ultrahigh purity grade
and purchased from Airgas (Madison, WI).

Sample Preparation and
Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry
GC/MS experiments were
performed on a Trace GC Ultra gas chromatograph
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy) equipped with a GC PAL autosampler
(CTC Analytics, Zwingen, Switzerland). Compounds were separated on
a 30 m × 0.25 mm (i.d.) × 0.25 μm (df) Crossbond 5% diphenyl/95% dimethyl polysiloxane column
(Restek Rxi-5Sil MS, Bellefonte, PA) with He carrier gas. The GC was
interfaced to the Quadrupole-Orbitrap instrument via a heated transfer
line. The instrument was characterized and regularly tuned and calibrated
with perfluorotributylamine (FC-43; Scientific Instrument Services,
Ringoes, NJ), introduced into the transfer line by a calibration gas
module. All MS experiments employed automatic gain control (AGC)12,14,15 and advanced signal processing
(ASP),16−19 and were acquired in profile mode.

Octafluoronaphthalene
Solutions of 1 pg/μL octafluoronaphthalene
(OFN) were prepared in iso-octane containing 0%, 1%, 2%, and 5% (v/v)
diesel fuel, obtained from a local gas station. Aliquots (1 μL)
were analyzed in triplicate, splitless, via the hot-needle technique
at an injector temperature of 220 °C and separated at 1.2 mL/min
He with oven gradient: isothermal at 40 °C for 1 min, 30 °C/min
to 165 °C, 120 °C/min to 275 °C, and isothermal at
275 °C for 5 min. The transfer line and source temperatures were
275 and 220 °C, respectively. The MS was configured for single
ion monitoring (SIM), using a 5 Th window around the OFN monoisotopic
peak (m/z 272), a scan range of m/z 106–300, resolution of 70 000
(m/Δm), relative to m/z 200, maximum injection time of 250
ms, and AGC target of 1 × 106. Electron ionization
(EI, 70 eV) was used.

EPA 8270 Pesticides Analysis
A 25–50
μg/mL
working solution in methylene chloride of 93 EPA 8270 semivolatile
organic pollutants was prepared by combination of the following, all
obtained from Restek: SV Internal Standard Mix, Benzoic Acid Mix,
Revised B/N Surrogate Mix, 8270 Benzidines Mix No. 2, 1,4-dioxane,
8270 MegaMix, and Acid Surrogate Mix (4/89 SOW). The working solution
was serially diluted from 25−50 μg/mL (2.5–5 ng
on column) to 25–50 pg/mL (2.5–5 fg on column) in methylene
chloride. A volume of 1 μL each was analyzed in triplicate using
EI (70 eV) at an injection split ratio of 10:1 and 1.2 mL/min He column
flow. The following oven program was used: 1 min isothermal at 80
°C, 25 °C/min to 280 °C, 5 °C/min to 320 °C,
and 1 min isothermal at 320 °C. The injector, transfer line,
and source temperatures were 270, 280, and 250 °C, respectively.
Targeted SIM analyses targeted the monoisotopic peak, or most-abundant
ion, of 93 pesticides with 3 Th isolation windows based on a scheduled
inclusion list (Supplemental Table S1 in the Supporting
Information), with a resolution of 17 500, an AGC target
of 1 × 106, and maximum injection time of 100 ms.

Polychlorinated Dibenzo-p-Dioxin and Dibenzofuran
Analysis
Intrarun sensitivity, linearity, and response reproducibility
for tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins (TCDD) was quantified
with two standard mixtures of 6 TCDD congeners (Campro Scientific,
Berlin, Germany) at concentrations ranging from 2 to 100 fg/μL,
or each at 10 fg/μL, respectively. Native and 13C-labeled
internal standard congeners were analyzed in targeted SIM mode with
10 Th windows using EI (70 eV), 300 μA emission current, 250
ms maximum injection time, and resolution 17 500. An extract
of pooled human blood containing tetra- and hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and hexachlorodibenzofuran congeners previously
quantified at ∼10–15 fg/uL using magnetic sector instrumentation
and standard methods conforming to EPA 1613 was provided by Thermo
Fisher Scientific (Bremen, Germany). The sample was analyzed in targeted
SIM mode with 2 Th windows for native congeners and full scan mode
for internal standards (at 1 pg/μL). Other parameters were the
same as for the standard TCDD mixtures.

Structural Characterization
of an Unknown Fatty Acid Methyl
Ester (FAME)
Bacterial fatty acids were methyl esterified
using sodium methoxide in anhydrous methanol at RT for 2 h. The reaction
was quenched with 2 N HCl and FAMEs were extracted with hexane. For
hydrogenation experiments, extracted FAMEs were dried under nitrogen
and subsequently hydrogenated in chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v) with
5% Pt on charcoal as detailed by Montanari et al.20 A bacterial acid methyl ester (BAME) mix standard, containing
26 FAMEs in methyl caproate, was used for system optimization. Samples
in hexane (1 μL) were injected via the hot-needle technique
at various split ratios depending on sample concentration, with an
injector temperature of 250 °C, He flow rate of 1 mL/min, and
the following oven program: 1 min isothermal at 150 °C, 15 °C/min
to 250 °C, 1 min isothermal at 250 °C, 80 °C/min to
320 °C, and 2 min isothermal at 320 °C. The transfer line
and source temperatures were 280 and 250 °C, respectively. Samples
were ionized via EI or positive mode chemical ionization (CI/PCI)
using acetonitrile (ACN) as the reagent gas (70 eV). Full-scan analyses
employed a scan range of m/z 75–400,
resolution of 17 500, AGC target of 1 × 106, and maximum injection time of 100 ms. Targeted MS/MS analyses employed
a 5 Th isolation window, normalized collision energy of 25 eV, resolution
of 17 500, AGC target of 1 × 106, and maximum
injection time of 250 ms.

For ACN PCI, 250 μm (i.d.) fused
silica capillary connected an ACN reservoir (6 mL) directly to the
MS source through the transfer line. A two-holed ferrule permitted
entry of both GC column and ACN capillary into the transfer line.
While the column extended into the source, the ACN capillary was set
back ∼5 cm from the source to prevent interference with the
GC eluent. A medium-flow metering valve (Swagelok, Solon, OH) between
the reservoir and transfer line regulated the flow of ACN into the
source. A source pressure of 7.1 × 10–5 Torr,
∼0.2 ms reagent injection time (at a 1 × 106 AGC target), and m/z 42 (protonated
ACN)-to-m/z 54 (1-methyleneimino-1-ethenylium,
or MIE) ratio of 5:1 were optimal for generation of molecular ion
MIE-adducts of unsaturated FAMEs.

Analysis of Arabidopsis
thaliana Polar Extracts
Polar metabolite extracts
of A. thaliana were
prepared and analyzed as detailed in the accompanying article.13 Briefly, wild-type A. thaliana were grown in liquid culture in stable isotope-enriched media (12C14N, 12C15N, 13C14N, and 13C15N). Following 12
d growth, plants were harvested, flash frozen, and macerated to a
fine powder. Aliquots of ∼250–350 mg of powder were
extracted as reported by Fiehn,21 and polar
fractions subjected to methoxyamination and silylation with either N-(t-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA) or N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) (Thermo Scientific,
Bellafonte, PA). Samples were ionized with either EI or methane PCI
using full scan MS or molecular-ion directed acquisition (MIDA)-MS/MS.

Data Analysis
Data were both manually queried and automatically
processed within Xcalibur Qual Browser 2.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Unless otherwise indicated, data were extracted with ±5–10
ppm mass error tolerances and peak areas (area-under-the-curve, AUC)
determined via the ICIS peak detection algorithm. Regression and statistical
analyses were performed in Origin (version 8.5.1 SR2, Origin Lab,
Northampton, MA). Isotopomer abundance or ratio errors were calculated
from the theoretical isotopomer abundances expected for a given elemental
formula. For EPA 8270 pesticide analysis, the ratio of first isotopomer
to the sum of the monoisotopomer and first isotopomer abundances was
used. For Arabidopsis thaliana metabolomic analysis,
the percent errors of the abundances of the first, second, and third
isotopomers relative to the monoisotopomer abundance were used, conforming
to the standard used by the Seven Golden Rules Excel macro.7,13

Results and Discussion
Instrument Construction
The GC/Quadrupole
(Q)-Orbitrap
MS instrument consists of a single-quadrupole GC/MS (DSQ II; Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Austin, TX) and a benchtop Orbitrap MS (Exactive;
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) coupled together via an
adapter manifold, shown in Figure 1 in gray,
dark red, and light red, respectively. Construction proceeded by removing
the Orbitrap MS’s atmospheric pressure (AP) inlet and associated
ion optics and sealing the AP inlet manifold openings with custom
flanges. The two-stage source turbo-molecular pump was then removed
and replaced with a smaller, turbo-molecular pump (60 L/s; Pfeiffer
Vacuum, Asslar, Germany) to reflect the decreased pumping requirements.
Into this vacated space, the beam-type CAD (collisional activation
and dissociation) collision cell (higher energy CAD, or HCD, cell,
for MS/MS) and electron multiplier/conversion dynode (EM) were relocated
from the opposite side of the Orbitrap MS’s c-trap and from
the single-quadrupole MS, respectively. Connections for the EM to
the external electrometer and dynode power supply were made via a
custom top-flange. On the opposite side of the Orbitrap MS’s
c-trap, the adapter manifold joined the single-quadrupole MS manifold
to the manifold previously housing the HCD cell. The EI/CI combination
source, curved prefilter flatapole, pre-quadrupole lens, and quadrupole
mass filter of the single-quadrupole MS remained. The gap between
the quadrupole mass filter and the c-trap of the Orbitrap MS was bridged
by the addition of a post-quadrupole lens, curved flatapole, custom
split lens for ion gating, and long transfer flatapole. The adapter
manifold was fitted with a turbo-molecular pump (210 L/s; Pfeiffer
Vacuum). Electrical connections for the additional ion optics elements
were made by feed-throughs installed in the adapter manifold. The
HCD cell was plumbed directly with ultrahigh purity nitrogen collision
gas, which also provided collisional cooling in the attached c-trap.
The EI/CI source was interfaced to the GC via a heated transfer line.
All component parts are labeled in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic of the GC/Quadrupole-Orbitrap instrument. The three component
manifolds, the Single-Quadrupole MS, adapter, and Exactive, are colored
in gray, light red, and dark red, respectively. The main ion optic
components and four turbo-molecular pumps (as gray outward arrows)
are labeled.

Electronics and Firmware
Modifications
Most of the
original electronics from both instruments were retained to drive
original and new ion optic and vacuum components. The EI/CI source
elements and the EM remained under single-quadrupole MS electronic
control, except for EI/CI source lens 2 (see Supplemental Figure S1
in the Supporting Information). Control
of source lens 2 was redirected to a spare dc output on the Orbitrap
MS. The Orbitrap MS electronics retained control over the same components,
as well as additional single-quadrupole MS components and all new
ion optic devices. The Orbitrap MS rf and dc outputs, originally controlling
AP inlet devices, were repurposed to drive the curved flatapoles and
pre/post-quadrupole mass filter lenses. The split lens electronics
were modified to provide an ion deflection potential of ±50 V,
rather than ±350 V, and to drive the new split lens device. Two
new circuit boards were added to the system to control the quadrupole
mass filter and provide rf and dc control for the transfer flatapole.

The Orbitrap MS instrument firmware (written in Python and based
on Thermo Q Exactive firmware version 2.0) was adapted to permit simultaneous
control of both component instruments via a single data system. Code
was written to enable ion injection, automatic gain control (AGC),
manual and automated signal optimization, ion optic and mass analyzer
calibration, quadrupole isolation, and MS/MS capabilities.

Scan Rate
and Resolution
Scan rates vary as a function
of resolution, and range from 24.1 Hz at resolution 8 500 down
to 1.0 Hz at resolution 200 000 (see Supplemental Figure S2
in the Supporting Information). Ion injection
and mass analysis parallelization can be employed up to resolution
130 000 (512 ms transient). If one considers a scan rate of
4 Hz to be the absolute minimum for practical application of this
technology on GC-time scale, the GC/Q-Orbitrap is amenable to analyses
requiring resolution up to 100 000.

Spectral Figures-of-Merit
and Quality
The FC-43 calibration
spectrum provides insight into several figures-of-merit and serves
as the basis for all calibration procedures (e.g., calibration of
ion transmission, mass accuracy, analyzer injection, advanced signal
processing (ASP), and quadrupole isolation). First, the single-scan
FC-43 profile spectra in Figure 2A,B highlight
the instrument’s typical mass accuracy and precision, demonstrating
externally calibrated mean mass errors of 0.24 ± 1.04 ppm for
38 routinely observed ions (errorrms = 1.06 ppm) (Supplemental
Table S2 in the Supporting Information).
Second, routine 1–2 ms ion accumulation times at an AGC target
of 1 × 106 indicate the overall efficiency of the
generation and transmission of ions. Third, a full distribution of
ions spanning the mass range from m/z 69–614 with significant representation of fragile or reactive
ions (m/z 219, m/z 502, and m/z 614) attests to the “gentleness” of the injection
path, the absence of unexpected mass discrimination issues, and low
levels of background water vapor (a 3:1 ratio of m/z 219:197 is typical for GC-trapping instruments).

Figure 2 (A) Single-scan
full mass range positive EI FC-43 calibration spectrum
acquired in profile mode. Mass errors (ppm) and compositions are shown
for major ion species. Average mass error with external calibration
was 0.24 ppm (σ = 1.04, errorrms = 1.06, n = 38). Mass accuracy and compositions for additional ions
are available in Table S2 in the Supporting Information. (B) Zoom-in on FC-43 m/z 502
monoisotope and first isotope acquired at 35 000 resolution
in profile mode.

While these specifications
are tailored to the FC-43 calibration
spectrum (Supplemental Figure S3 in the Supporting
Information), spectra collected on an instrument that is calibrated
to minimize ion/molecule reactions, mass discrimination, and the harshness
of ion transmission should similarly demonstrate little evidence of
those adverse effects in analyte spectra. In GC/MS, the primary method
of chromatographic feature annotation is to match experimental spectra
against large reference databases of EI spectra.22 As such, spectra quality is dictated by the extent of the
match between experimental and reference spectra. In Figure 3, experimental single-scan spectra of methyl eicosanoate
(C20:0, C21H42O2) (panel A) and hexachloroethane
(C2Cl6) (panel B) are juxtaposed with unit-resolution
reference spectra from the NIST database22 (in red). Both experimental spectra faithfully reproduce the expected
ions and relative abundances present in the reference spectra and
are correctly matched as the top hit by NIST with match scores of
85.3 and 95.0, respectively. The slight left- or right-shift of the
experimental spectra is due to mass defects that are missing in the
library spectra because of peak centroiding to the nearest nominal
mass and unit-mass accuracy mass analysis. The GC/Q-Orbitrap spectra
possess, in these two examples, an average mass error of 0.57 ±
0.50 ppm and 1.14 ± 0.39 ppm, respectively. High mass accuracy
and retention of all spectral features (i.e., the mass defect) facilitate
elemental composition assignment and identification, even in the absence
of library spectra.

for (A)
methyl eicosanoate (average mass error 0.57 ppm, σ = 0.50 ppm,
errorrms = 0.75 ppm, n = 16) and (B) hexachloroethane
(average mass error 1.14 ppm, σ = 0.39 ppm, errorrms = 1.19 ppm, n = 7). Spectra are juxtaposed with
NIST reference spectra (bottom, red). Spectra were matched as the
top hit (number in parenthesis) with NIST match scores as indicated.
Spectra were acquired at 17 500 resolution with a 1 ×
106 ion target.

Quadrupole Isolation
A quadrupole mass filter was included
in the GC/Q-Orbitrap design to boost instrument sensitivity in targeted
and trace analyses, used in experiments such as targeted selected
ion monitoring (SIM), targeted MS/MS, or data-dependent MS/MS. While
both SIM and MS/MS improve sensitivity for target analytes under high
background conditions by enhancing analyte signal-to-noise, the latter
also facilitates target identification and structural elucidation.
For the purpose of enhancing S/N in trace analyses, two competing
processes must be reconciled. First, to accumulate greater populations
of ions the target analyte must be efficiently transmitted through
the quadrupole, with wider isolation widths yielding higher transmission
efficiency.23 Second, to successfully exclude
matrix background and accumulate target ion populations in the allotted
time, tighter isolation windows are indicated. In practice, a compromise
must be reached between the two processes based on the quadrupole’s
efficiency of target ion transmission. Quadrupole transmission efficiency
curves for for the GC/Q-Orbitrap are plotted in Figure 4A for four stable ions from FC-43. Here, the percent transmission
relative to rf-only quadrupole transmission (q =
0.706) of each ion was measured as a function of isolation width (from
50 Th, to the minimum width for the device, 0.4 Th). A low ion target
of 1 × 105 was employed to prevent space-charge effects
in the c-trap, which become more problematic when a small m/z-range of ions are stored. At unit resolution
(1 Th isolation width), isolation transmission efficiency is between
35 and 75% relative to rf only. While even higher transmission at
smaller isolation widths is always desired, given the specifications
of this quadrupole, transmission was determined to be acceptable.

Figure 4 (A) Quadrupole
isolation transmission efficiency. Transmission
relative to rf-only (q = 0.706) operation is plotted
for four stable FC-43 ions as a function of measured isolation width
using an AGC target of 1 × 105, 17 500 resolution,
and <100 ms injection times. (B) Chromatographic and spectral performance
of 1 pg octafluoronaphthalene (OFN) in 0–5% v/v diesel. Chromatographic
peak areas (denoted “A”) and spectral signal-to-noise
(S/N) are noted. (C) Response curves (peak area versus amount on column)
for 5 of 94 EPA 8270 compounds targeted by scheduled SIM (3 Th) over
6 orders-of-magnitude. Linearity and detection limit data are given
Table 1 and Supplemental Figure S4 in the Supporting Information. (D) Quantification of
2,3,7,8-TCDD at 10–15 fg on column in human pooled blood extract.
At left, extracted ion chromatograms (±10 ppm, 5 pt Gaussian
smoothing) of native congener quantification isotopomers, m/z 320 and m/z 322, analyzed in separate SIM (4 Th) scans, and of 13C-labeled internal standard (IS) congeners analyzed in full
scan are plotted. The single-scan SIM mass spectra at the elution
apex for the targeted native congener isotopomers are plotted at right.

In general, targeted analyses
are performed on samples containing
high levels of chemical background in which the target analyte is
a very small percentage, not on calibrants as used to benchmark quadrupole
transmission efficiency above. Figure 4B shows
the analysis of 1 pg of OFN neat and in increasingly complex diesel
fuel matrixes. In SIM mode with a 5 Th isolation window around the
molecular ion of OFN (m/z 272),
1 pg of OFN was detected at all diesel concentrations with spectral
S/N exceeding 1400 and 300 at 0% and 5% diesel (v/v), respectively,
despite apparent chromatographic disturbances, ionization suppression
by matrix ions, and numerous background ions present in the isolation
range at 5%. In other experiments where the mass filter was not used
(data not shown), no OFN (1 pg) could be detected in the presence
of 1% diesel. While the quadrupole mass filter successfully eliminates
matrix background falling outside of the isolation window, it is the
mass selectivity provided by high mass accuracy and high resolution
mass analysis (here, 70 000) that enables the differentiation
of the ion of interest, with m/z verified by high mass accuracy, from co-isolated, and therefore
co-enriched, background.

Linear Dynamic Range and Sensitivity
Using a 94 compound
EPA 827024 mix, linearity, dynamic range,
and sensitivity were assessed through replicate injections at amounts
ranging from 5 fg to 5 ng, neat, on column, in scheduled targeted-SIM
mode. Figure 4C shows response curves for 5
of the 94 compounds. Average linearity (measured as the percent relative
standard deviation, % RSD, of response factors, i.e., area-under-the-curve
normalized by concentration) was 31.5% RSD, and 26.5% RSD if the 5–10
fg data in the 2,4-dichlorophenol data set were excluded. While the
linear regression (adjusted R2 > 0.99)
showed high correlation to a linear model, the moderately high percent
RSDs obtained suggest some limitations of the instrument for quantification
that need to be further explored. Responses were typically detected
down to 5–10 fg on column for chromatographically well-behaved
compounds in the mixture. Linearity metrics are presented in Table 1, along with the average peak apex S/N and mass
error at the detection limit, i.e., 5 fg on column for phenol-d6. All compounds in Table 1 were detected at their lowest concentration with greater than S/N
4 and mass errors less than 7 ppm, with little or no chemical interference
present in the chromatograms or corresponding spectra (Supplemental
Figure S4 in the Supporting Information).

in a pooled human blood extract matrix. Native 2,3,7,8-TCDD, quantified
previously in this sample by magnetic sector MS at ∼10–15
fg/μL, was detected at 10–15 fg on column with low mass
errors, and an isotope ratio error (m/z 319/m/z 321) of 8.4%. This meets
the EPA 1613 requirement that isotope ratio errors are not greater
than 15%.25 Similarly, isotope ratio errors
for native hexa-CDD and hexa-CDF congeners, also at 10–15 fg
on column, were −8.3 ± 25% and −29 ± 40% (Supplemental
Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). All 13C-labeled congener internal standards were quantified
with isotope ratio errors less than 3%. Affirming the linearity and
reproducibility of these measurements, we further assessed the intrarun
response reproducibility of six TCDD congeners at 10 fg on column,
near the limit-of-detection, as 15% (m/z 322) and 21% (m/z 320) RSD with
isotope ratio errors of −12 ± 24% (Supplemental Figure
S6A in the Supporting Information). With
a similar mixture where TCDD congener amounts on column were 2, 5,
10, 25, 50, and 100 fg, intrarun linearity was measured as 15% RSD
of response factors from 5 to 100 fg on column (2 fg on column was
not detected). Over the detected concentration range, isotopic ratio
errors were −4 ± 17% (Supplemental Figure S6B in the Supporting Information).

These data reflect
the benefit of quadrupole mass filtering (SIM)
in maintaining linearity over a wide dynamic range and extending detection
limits. Indeed, these measurements would have not been possible without
quadrupole isolation. Additionally, high resolution and accurate mass
analysis permitted separation of signals of interest from background
signals, even at trace levels in heavy matrix, to maintain isotopic
ratio fidelity and mass accuracy. These attributes additionally enable
the instrument to meet the analysis requirements of EPA methods, like
1613, normally requiring magnetic sector instrumentation.25

Isotopomer Abundance Accuracy
Isotopomer
abundances,
peak shapes, and/or isotopic fine structure can serve as important
orthogonal filters for candidate elemental compositions. Typically,
the error of the ratio of the sum of the mono- and first isotopomer
abundances over the monoisotopomer abundance,26 or the error of the relative abundances of the first through third
isotopomers,7 are used to assess isotopomer
abundance accuracy. Using the former method in Figure 5A, isotopomer ratio errors (IRE) for 91 of the 94 aforementioned
EPA 8270 analytes are plotted as a function of monoisotopomer abundance,
extracted at a tolerance of ±5 ppm, in a full scan analysis of
5 ng on column with resolution 17 500. An average error of
−2.77 ± 4.96% was observed for all 91 compounds (errorrms = 5.65%). Only extracted monoisotopomer peaks with areas
less than 1 × 109 exhibited isotopomer ratio errors
greater than ±5%. Note Orbitrap isotopomer abundance accuracy
is inversely related to mass analysis resolution. Thus, analyses using
resolutions greater than the 17 500 used here would likely
exhibit lower isotopomer abundance accuracy (∼10% at resolution
100 000).9,27

Figure 5 (A) Percent isotopomer ratio error (IRE)
versus extracted ion chromatographic
peak area for the monoisotopomeric ion (±5 ppm) for 91 of of
94 EPA 8270 compounds in an analysis at 17 500 resolution.
Average IRE was −2.77%. (B) Accuracy and precision of mass
errors (ppm) and isotopomer abundance errors (IAE, in percent) for
81 putative metabolites and analysis artifacts from the metabolomics
study of Arabidopsis thaliana. M + 1, M + 2, and
M + 3 correspond to the individual IAE for the first, second, and
third isotopomers, respectively.

These data indicate that the GC/Q-Orbitrap, with the combination
of very high mass accuracy, high resolution, and isotopomer abundance
errors on average less than 5%, will be a powerful tool for the determination
of unique elemental composition for mass spectral features of interest.
In the accompanying article,13 this hypothesis
is borne out in the ability to uniquely assign elemental compositions
to over 80 putative Arabidopsis thaliana metabolites
and analysis artifacts. For that set of assignments, the distribution
of mass and isotopomer abundance errors are displayed in Figure 5B. Again, isotopomer abundance errors are on average
less than 5%, with median errors less than 2.5%. Mass errors average
about 2.5 ppm.

Tools for Structural Characterization of
Unknowns
The
GC/Q-Orbitrap also has capabilities for structural elucidation. Identification
in GC/MS requires comparison of retention time and fragmentation pattern
against authentic, preferably internal, reference standards. For a
true unknown, a reasonable structural hypothesis is required to guide
the purchase and/or synthesis of potential reference standards. While
EI-based full-scan spectra are typically rich with ions from which
structural inferences can be made, this process can be prohibitively
difficult, especially for low-level analytes or analytes that coelute
with other species. As such, alternative analysis modalities can be
beneficial to elucidate structure. Numerous such analysis tools have
been implemented on the GC/Q-Orbitrap instrument, including alternative
ionization types (positive or negative chemical ionization with any
reagent gas, e.g., methane, acetonitrile (ACN), isobutane, acetone,
etc.), targeted-MS/MS (and targeted-SIM), and advanced data-dependent
MS/MS capabilities. Supplemental Figure S7 in the Supporting Information provides examples of these analysis
modes, and the accompanying article13 explores
the use of advanced data-dependent MS/MS acquisition in detail.

Figure 6 presents a unifying example of how
all of the aforementioned analysis modalities can be used in concert
to characterize an unknown, such as a fatty acid methyl ester (FAME)
produced from a bacterial source. The EI spectrum of the unknown in
Figure 6A has a molecular ion mass of 310.286 63
Th, corresponding to an elemental formula of C20H38O2. While the EI spectrum is indistinguishable from the
unknown’s cyclic and monoenoic isobars, methyl methylene-octadecanoate
(C18:1 CFA) and methyl nonadecenoate (C19:1), the unknown elutes nearly
30 s prior to these isobars.

ester. (A) EI mass
spectrum of the untreated unknown. (B) EI mass spectrum of the unknown
following hydrogenation, indicating that the unknown is monoenoic
(2 Th mass shift with hydrogenation), and has a branched structure
based on characteristic fragments a and b. The proposed structure
of the hydrogenated unknown is depicted above. (C) Acetonitrile PCI
MS and MS/MS spectra. The MS spectrum shows several molecular ion
adducts, including [M + MIE]+. The [M + MIE]+ ion was isolated and fragmented at 25 eV to generate the MS/MS spectrum.
The characteristic α and ω ions localize the double bond.
The proposed structure of the unknown is shown above.

Following hydrogenation of the bacterial FAME sample,
the retention
time of the unknown was found to increase, indicating a higher m/z, and yield the EI spectrum in Figure 6B. This spectrum indicates that the unknown is monoenoic,
as the molecular ion mass increased to 312.302 28 Th, corresponding
to the addition of 2 hydrogens for a hydrogenated composition of C20H40O2. Again distinct in spectrum and
retention time from its saturated isobar, nonadecanoate (C19:0), the
EI spectrum of the hydrogenated unknown also has characteristic fragment
ions that suggest a methyl branch at carbon 11.28,29 This spectrum matches well with the reference spectrum of methyl
11-methyl-octadecanoate (11-methyl-C18:0). From this information,
the unknown can be said to possess the general structure of methyl
11-methyl-octadecenoate (11-methyl-C18:1), although the location of
the double bond remains unknown.

To localize the double bond,
ACN PCI was next employed. In ACN
PCI, the reactive species generated by self-ionization of ACN, 1-methyleneimino-1-ethyenylium
(MIE) or H2C=N+=C=CH2, covalently adducts to the double bonds of unsaturated FAMEs
to produce a distinct ion, corresponding to [M + MIE]+,
in the MS spectrum. Isolation and collisional dissociation of the
[M + MIE]+ ion results in diagnostic fragment ions that
permit unambiguous localization of double bonds within the FAME.30−33 The ACN PCI MS spectrum, in the top panel of Figure 6C, shows the [M + MIE]+ ion of the unknown at m/z 364.321 01 with elemental composition,
C23H42O2N. Targeted MS/MS of this
ion reveals diagnostic α and ω ions that correspond to
fragmentation allylic to the double bond (plus a transferred proton).
These ions successfully localize the double bond to position 12. Thus,
the structure of the unknown can be tentatively assigned as methyl
11-methyl-12-octadecenoate (11-methyl-12-C18:1). While synthesis and
side-by-side analysis of this compound is required to confirm this
assignment, this vignette demonstrates, using a combination of EI,
ACN PCI, full scan MS, and targeted MS/MS, the flexibility of the
GC/Q-Orbitrap to resolve intractable structural characterization and
identification challenges.

Conclusion
We
have described the construction, optimization, and evaluation
of a new high-resolution GC/MS, the GC/Quadrupole-Orbitrap. This benchtop
instrument is the first-ever, applications-grade, Orbitrap-based instrument
dedicated for GC/MS. The GC/Quadrupole-Orbitrap robustly generates,
transmits, manipulates, and detects EI/CI-generated ions supplied
by a GC in four modes: full scan, SIM with quadrupole isolation, “all
ion fragmentation”-MS/MS with beam-type CAD in the HCD collision
cell, and MS/MS with both quadrupole isolation and beam-type CAD.
With a dynamic, parallelized ion injection and mass analysis scheme
with AGC, this instrument boasts a 23 Hz (32 ms transient) scan rate
at resolution 10 000 (at m/z 200), and a 1 Hz scan rate at resolution 200 000, all while
maintaining low-to-subppm mass errors. Use of the quadrupole mass
filter enables low-femtogram detection limits for common pollutants,
with a linear dynamic range spanning 6 orders-of-magnitude. Lastly,
the high signal-to-noise, high mass accuracy, and high resolution
data generated by this instrument facilitate annotation of unknown
spectral features with chemical formulas and enable structural characterization
through flexible analysis modalities.

The GC/Q-Orbitrap has
potential to increase the rate of success
for annotation and identifications of unknowns in the analysis of
complex biological or environmental samples. By enabling researchers
in diverse fields to come closer to the full story in their GC/MS
analyses, the GC/Q-Orbitrap has promise to bridge the fundamental
technology gap in accurate mass and high-resolution instrumentation
that exists today in small molecule analysis.
