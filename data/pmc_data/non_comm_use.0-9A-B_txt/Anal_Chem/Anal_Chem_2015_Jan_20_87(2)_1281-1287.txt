Theta-glass emitters are used to
rapidly mix two solutions to induce
either protein folding or unfolding during nanoelectrospray (nanoESI).
Mixing acid-denatured myoglobin with an aqueous ammonium acetate solution
to increase solution pH results in protein folding during nanoESI.
A reaction time and upper limit to the droplet lifetime of 9 ±
2 μs is obtained from the relative abundance of the folded conformer
in these rapid mixing experiments compared to that obtained from solutions
at equilibrium and a folding time constant of 7 μs. Heme reincorporation
does not occur, consistent with the short droplet lifetime and the
much longer time constant for this process. Similar mixing experiments
with acid-denatured cytochrome c and the resulting
folding during nanoESI indicate a reaction time of between 7 and 25
μs depending on the solution composition. The extent of unfolding
of holo-myoglobin upon rapid mixing with theta-glass emitters is less
than that reported previously (Fisher
et al. Anal. Chem. 2014 , 86 , 4581 −4588 24702054 ), a result
that is attributed to the much smaller, ∼1.5 μm, average
o.d. tips used here. These results indicate that the time frame during
which protein folding or unfolding can occur during nanoESI depends
both on the initial droplet size, which can be varied by changing
the emitter tip diameter, and on the solution composition. This study
demonstrates that protein folding or unfolding processes that occur
on the ∼10 μs time scale can be readily investigated
using rapid mixing with theta-glass emitters combined with mass spectrometry.

==== Body
Electrospray ionization (ESI)
mass spectrometry (MS) is widely used to obtain information about
protein structure, including protein identification and analysis of
posttranslational modifications.1−3 Information about protein conformation
can also be obtained from charge state distributions in ESI mass spectra.4−8 Gaseous ions formed from solutions in which a protein has a native
or globular conformation are less highly charged than the corresponding
ions formed from solutions in which the protein is unfolded. The relative
abundances of different conformations of a protein in solution have
been obtained by modeling the resulting charge-state distributions
observed in ESI mass spectra.6 Charge-state
distributions have been used to monitor protein unfolding both as
a function of temperature by heating the sample solution during ESI4,7,8 and as a function of solution
pH by inducing a pH change in the sample solution using the electrolytic
oxidation of water that occurs at the metal–liquid interface
in an ESI emitter.5

Protein conformational
changes can also take place during the ESI
process. McLuckey and co-workers demonstrated that exposing aqueous
ESI droplets containing folded proteins to either gaseous acids9 or bases10 in an ESI
interface can result in a bimodal charge-state distribution of ions,
indicating that a fraction of the protein population unfolds in the
ESI droplet. ESI droplets generated from “native” protein
solutions have also been exposed to acids and supercharging reagents
in solution by flowing a continuous stream of solution from a hypodermic
needle into the ESI plume.11 The stream–droplet
interactions in these experiments result in bimodal charge-state distributions
of the resulting protein ions, indicative of protein unfolding. Protein
unfolding in ESI droplets can also be induced thermally, which is
the likely mechanism of electrothermal supercharging,12,13 wherein high charge states are obtained from buffered aqueous protein
solutions by raising the electrospray potential to collisionally activate
and heat the ESI droplets.

In contrast to the many studies of
protein unfolding during ESI,
there are fewer reports of protein folding during ESI. Acid-denatured
proteins in ESI droplets have been exposed to gaseous bases in an
ESI interface, resulting in a bimodal distribution of charge states
for some proteins.14 Although gas-phase
proton transfer reactions may contribute to lower charging in these
experiments, the bimodal charge-state distributions indicate that
a fraction of the protein population folds as a result of an increase
in the droplet pH. However, comparisons of the results obtained from
these experiments to those from bulk-solution experiments are complicated
because of the dynamic nature of ESI. A low charge-state distribution
of myoglobin that was thermally denatured was observed in nanoESI,
which suggests that protein folding occurred in the droplets upon
rapid evaporative cooling.8

Quantitative
information about protein folding kinetics can be
obtained in mixing experiments, and ESI MS has been combined with
a variety of rapid mixers, including continuous,15,16 stopped,17 and laminar flow18,19 mixers, to measure the kinetics of protein folding17−19 and unfolding16 and the reincorporation
rates of noncovalent cofactors into the protein structure.15 In conventional mixers, faster kinetic processes
can be measured by increasing the flow rates of the solutions. A dead
time of 200 μs has been reported for a laminar flow mixer coupled
with MS operating at a flow rate of 10 μL/s.19 This setup was used to study the subms folding steps that
occur after the initial collapse, or “burst-phase,”
of apo-myoglobin that takes place on an even shorter time scale (∼7
μs time constant).20 Rapid mixing
of two solutions during ESI has also been used to unfold proteins
during ESI. Microfabricated dual sprayers have been used to mix solutions
containing peptides or proteins with solutions containing supercharging
reagents,21 resulting in increased charging
indicative of protein unfolding.

Double-barrel wire-in-a-capillary
emitters made from theta glass
(theta-glass emitters) have also been used to mix solutions during
ESI. Rapid mixing from theta-glass emitters was first used to form
a noncovalent complex between a short peptide (KAA) and a glycopeptide
(vancomycin) and to exchange hydrogen and deuterium with undeuterated
and partially deuterated vancomycin during ESI.22 Substantial mixing was reported to occur in the Taylor
cone prior to droplet formation.22 Solutions
containing folded proteins were mixed with acidic solutions using
theta-glass emitters, which produced bimodal charge-state distributions
and loss of the heme group for myoglobin.23 These results indicate that protein unfolding occurred during ESI.23 Supercharging reagents were mixed into solutions
containing folded proteins during ESI using theta-glass emitters which
resulted in higher charging and loss of heme for myoglobin, consistent
with unfolding of the proteins in the ESI droplets induced by the
supercharging reagents.23 A fast complexation
reaction was used to show that complete mixing can occur between two
different solutions in the theta-glass emitters during nanoESI.24 An estimate of the droplet lifetime of <27
μs was determined24 from the reaction
kinetics between l-ascorbic acid and 2,6-dichloroindophenol
using theta-glass emitters with ∼1.5 μm o.d. tips and
from the faster reaction rates observed in droplets over those in
bulk solution.25,26 The very short time scale for
mixing and droplet lifetimes indicates that fast protein folding could
be observed by rapidly mixing solutions in theta-glass emitters coupled
with MS.24 Investigation of protein folding
by mixing solutions using theta-glass emitters has the advantage of
very low flow rates, e.g., as low as 1.4 nL/s, resulting in low sample
consumption.24

Here, theta-glass
emitters are used to investigate protein folding
and unfolding during nanoESI by inducing a pH change in the electrospray
solution by rapidly mixing two solutions at the emitter tip. The relative
flow rates of these solutions are measured using peptides as standards.
From the measured extents of myoglobin and cytochrome c folding and known protein-folding time constants, a time of between
7 and 25 μs, depending on solution composition, is obtained
as an upper limit for the lifetime of nanoESI droplets. Significantly
fewer sodium ions are adducted to the ions generated from the native-like
conformer when native myoglobin is mixed with acid using the theta-glass
emitters than to these ions generated from a native solution. This
is likely the result of a higher concentration of protons and the
short time available for protein unfolding to occur. These results
suggest that rapid mixing from theta-glass emitters may be useful
in reducing sodium adduction in native MS.

Experimental Section
Experiments were performed using a 9.4 T Fourier-transform ion
cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer that is described elsewhere.27 Theta glass capillaries (Warner Instruments,
LLC, Hamden, CT) were pulled using a model p-87 Flaming/Brown micropipette
puller (Sutter Instruments Co., Novato, CA) into tips with an o.d.
of 1.36 ± 0.02 μm parallel to and 1.71 ± 0.04 μm
perpendicular to the central divider.24 A grounded platinum wire is brought into contact with the solution
that is loaded into each barrel, and a backing pressure of ∼10
psi is applied to the back end of the capillary. Ion formation is
initiated by applying a potential of ∼−700 V to the
heated capillary of the mass spectrometer interface. All data were
acquired using a Predator data station (National High Magnetic Field
Laboratory, Tallahassee, FL), and mass spectra were background subtracted.
Average charge states are computed as the abundance weighted sum of
individual charge states in a distribution. All reported uncertainties
are standard deviations determined from three replicate measurements.

Leu-enkephalin acetate salt hydrate, Met-enkephalin acetate salt
hydrate, ammonium acetate, formic acid, equine apo- and holo-myoglobin,
equine cytochrome c, and polypropylenimine hexadecaamine
dendrimer, generation 3.0, were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). Glacial acetic acid was obtained from Fisher Scientific (Fair
Lawn, NJ). Solutions were prepared with an analyte concentration of
10 μM in 18.2 MΩ water from a Milli-Q water purification
system (Millipore, Billerica, MA).

The initial pH of droplets
formed when two solutions are mixed
using the theta-glass emitters is determined from the pKb value of ammonia (4.8), the pKa values of acetic and formic acid (4.8 and 3.8, respectively;
all values at 25 °C),28 and the initial
concentrations of these species in the droplets. Initial concentrations
are determined from the initial concentrations of the analytes in
the solutions in both barrels of the theta-glass emitters and from
the relative flow rates of these solutions during nanoESI. Relative
flow rates are measured using Leu-enkephalin and Met-enkephalin as
internal standards (1.0 μM) as described elsewhere.24

Results and Discussion
Unfolding Holo-Myoglobin
During NanoESI
In low-ionic-strength
aqueous solutions (salt concentrations of less than ∼0.02 M),
holo-myoglobin (holo-Mb) has a native conformation between pH = 5
and 7,29 a less-compact globular structure
around pH = 3,29 and an unfolded structure
with no heme group attached at lower pH.30 A representative nanoESI mass spectrum of holo-Mb in a 1.0 mM aqueous
ammonium acetate solution (pH = 6.4) is shown in Figure 1a. The charge states (7–9+) are indicative of forming
these ions from an aqueous solution in which the protein has a native
structure.6 A nanoESI mass spectrum obtained
by mixing this solution with a 1.0 M aqueous acetic acid solution
at a 1:1 ratio (pH = 2.6) is shown in Figure 1b. The 10–26+ charge states of apo-myoglobin (apo-Mb) are
formed and no holo-Mb is observed, indicating that extensive unfolding
of the protein and concomitant loss of the heme group has occurred
in solution.

Figure 1 NanoESI mass spectra of (a) holo-Mb in a 1.0 mM aqueous
ammonium
acetate solution (pH = 6.4), (b) this ammonium acetate solution mixed
with a 1.0 M aqueous acetic acid solution at a 1:1 ratio (pH = 2.6),
and (c) this ammonium acetate solution mixed with the acetic acid
solution using a theta-glass emitter (estimated pH = 2.7). Insets
in (a) and (c) show the extent of Na+ adduction to the
8+ charge states and, in (c), the distributions of apo- and holo-Mb
between m/z 900 and 1400.

A nanoESI mass spectrum resulting
from mixing these two solutions
using the theta-glass emitters is shown in Figure 1c. The charge-state distribution of holo-Mb is bimodal, with
a high abundance distribution between 8+ and 12+ (comprising 86 ±
3% of myoglobin) and a low abundance distribution between 13+ and
19+ (comprising 11 ± 1% of myoglobin). The distribution between
13+ and 19+ corresponds to more open structures resulting from protein
unfolding during nanoESI. The 13–17+ charge states of apo-Mb
are also observed (comprising 3 ± 2% of myoglobin), indicating
that some heme loss accompanies unfolding of the protein in the nanoESI
droplet.

The average charge state of the distribution between
8+ and 12+
in the rapid mixing experiments (9.8 ± 0.2) is higher than the
average charge state of holo-Mb in the mass spectra obtained from
the pH = 6.4 solution (8.0 ± 0.1). The higher charging obtained
for the folded form of the protein in the rapid mixing experiments
may be a result of a small change in the conformation, or it could
be due to effects of solution composition on charging. To determine
the role of solution composition on charging in these experiments,
nanoESI mass spectra of polypropylenimine hexadecaamine dendrimer,
generation 3.0 (DAB-16), were obtained under similar conditions. NanoESI
of DAB-16 in a 1.0 mM aqueous ammonium acetate solution adjusted to
pH = 6.4 with acetic acid results in an average charge state of 3.6
± 0.1 (Figure 2a). This solution was mixed
with a 1.0 M aqueous acetic acid solution at a 1:1 ratio (pH = 2.6),
and in the nanoESI mass spectra of the resulting solution, the average
charge state is 4.0 ± 0.1 (Figure 2b).
Results from small-angle neutron scattering, viscosimetry, and molecular
dynamics studies indicate that the conformation of DAB-16 does not
strongly depend on solution composition.31 Thus, the slightly higher charging obtained from this solution is
likely a result of the different solution composition, although it
may also reflect small changes to the shape of DAB-16. These results
suggest that the shift in charging of the folded form of myoglobin
in the rapid mixing experiments may be due, at least in part, to the
different solution composition as well as any potential change to
the native protein structure.

acetate solution adjusted to pH = 6.4 with acetic acid and (b) this
solution adjusted to pH = 2.6 by mixing with a 1.0 M aqueous acetic
acid solution at a 1:1 ratio. qave denotes
the average charge state.

Fisher et al.23 also reported
that myoglobin
unfolds when aqueous holo-Mb is mixed with an aqueous solution of
1% acetic acid (∼174 mM) using theta-glass emitters, resulting
in the formation of 7% apo-Mb. In our experiment, a 5-fold higher
concentration of acetic acid is used, yet only 3% apo-Mb is produced
(Figure 1c). The different extents of unfolding
and heme loss in these two experiments are likely a result of different
reaction times. The reaction time is limited by the droplet lifetime,
which depends on the initial droplet diameter32 and, thus, on the diameter of the electrospray capillary.33 Fisher et al. used theta-glass emitters with
∼10 μm o.d. tips, whereas ∼1.5 μm o.d. tips
were used here, which results in smaller initial droplets and less
time for protein unfolding to occur.

It is also interesting
that there is less sodium ion adduction
on the folded holo-Mb ions formed after mixing the two solutions using
the theta-glass emitters (Figure 1c) than on
those formed directly from the ammonium acetate solution (Figure 1a). For example, the average number of sodium ions
adducted to the 8+ charge state is 3.1 ± 0.8 in the nanoESI mass
spectra of the ammonium acetate solution and only 0.7 ± 0.2 in
those resulting from the solutions mixed using the theta-glass emitters.
The lower average number of sodium adducts upon mixing likely results
from the >1000-fold increase in the initial concentration of protons
in the droplet, which can displace sodium ions near the surface of
the protein during droplet evaporation.

Folding Apo-Myoglobin During
NanoESI
There are at least
three conformers of apo-myoglobin (apo-Mb) that exist in aqueous solution.
Between pH = 5 and 7, apo-Mb adopts a conformation similar to that
of native holo-Mb, at pH = 4, it has a less compact globular structure,
and below pH = 3, it is unfolded.34 NanoESI
of acid-denatured apo-Mb (pH = 2.9; Figure 3a) results in a charge-state distribution between 11+ and 28+. This
high charging is consistent with an unfolded form of apo-Mb in solution.
Results from raising the pH of this solution using a 100 mM aqueous
ammonium acetate solution are shown in Figure 3b–d. The addition of ammonium acetate results in the elimination
of the highest charge states, and a second charge-state distribution
between 7+ and 9+ becomes more abundant with increasing pH. This charge-state
distribution is consistent with a globular conformer in solution and
comprises 13 ± 4%, 25 ± 5%, and 35 ± 7% of myoglobin
at pH = 3.9, 4.4, and 4.7, respectively (Figure 3b–d). The 11+ charge state is slightly more abundant than
the 10+ and 12+ charge states, suggesting that a partially folded
intermediate structure may also be present.

apo-Mb mixed with a 100 mM aqueous ammonium acetate solution at ratios
of (b) 10:1 (pH = 3.9), (c) 2:1 (pH = 4.4), and (d) 1:1 (pH = 4.7),
and (e) acid-denatured apo-Mb mixed with this ammonium acetate solution
using a theta-glass emitter (estimated pH = 4.7). Percentages are
the relative abundances of the folded fractions (7–9+ charge
states) of apo-Mb.

Mixing the initial acidified
solution (Figure 3a) with the 100 mM aqueous
ammonium acetate solution using
the theta-glass emitters produces droplets with an initial pH of ∼4.7.
In the nanoESI mass spectra resulting from this experiment (Figure 3e), there are at least two charge-state distributions
for apo-Mb: one between 10+ and 21+ corresponding to an unfolded conformer
and another between 7+ and 9+ corresponding to the fraction of apo-Mb
that is folded into a globular conformer during nanoESI (25 ±
2% of apo-Mb). The 11+ charge state is again more abundant than the
10+ and 12+, possibly suggesting the presence of a partially folded
intermediate structure. At pH = 4.7, the equilibrium distribution
of folded protein (7−9+) constitutes 35 ± 7% of apo-Mb
(Figure 3d). However, the abundance of this
distribution in the rapid mixing experiments (estimated initial droplet
pH = 4.7) more closely resembles that in the nanoESI mass spectra
of a pH = 4.4 solution at equilibrium, wherein it compromises 25 ±
5% of apo-Mb (Figure 3c). This result indicates
that the droplet lifetime is sufficiently short so that equilibrium
is not reached during nanoESI and that protein folding is incomplete.

The initial collapse of apo-Mb from an unfolded to a globular structure
occurs with a time constant of ∼7 μs,20 and the subsequent formation of a structure similar to
that of native holo-Mb takes more than a ms to occur.35 In previous mixing experiments using these same theta-glass
emitters, a <27 μs droplet lifetime was deduced from the
extent of product formation of a fast reaction with a known rate constant
in bulk solution.24 The short droplet lifetime
established in those experiments indicates that only the initial collapse
of apo-Mb is likely to occur to a significant extent in the droplets.

An estimate of the time scale for protein folding in this study
is obtained by modeling the initial collapse of apo-Mb as an independent,
two-state folding reaction.36,37 The integrated rate
law for a two-state folding reaction is given in eq 1: 1  where t is the reaction time,
τ is the protein folding time constant, Ae is the abundance of the folded protein conformer at equilibrium,
and Ao and At are the abundances of the folded protein conformer
at times 0 and t, respectively. From the relative
abundances of the globular apo-Mb conformer in the unmixed, equilibrium,
and rapid mixing experiments (Figure 3a,d,e,
respectively) and the 7 μs time constant of the initial collapse
of apo-Mb,20 a reaction time of 9 ±
2 μs is obtained. This reaction time is consistent with the
<27 μs droplet lifetime reported previously that was deduced
on the basis of the extent of product formation for a bimolecular
reaction and a known solution reaction rate constant.24 Because the concentrations of the reagents increase to
an unknown extent as droplets evaporate and bimolecular reaction rates
depend on concentration, there is a significant uncertainty in the
true droplet lifetime obtained from previous measurements. In contrast,
folding of apo-Mb is a unimolecular process that does not depend on
protein concentration at the concentrations used. Surface effects
as a result of the high surface-to-volume ratios of small droplets
compared to that of bulk solution may influence protein folding rates
in droplets.26 However, similarity between
the droplet lifetimes obtained by both methods indicate that surface
effects may be small in these protein folding experiments.

Folding
and Reincorporation of the Heme
Although folding
of apo-Mb occurs quickly,20,35 reincorporation of
the heme group into the protein structure requires considerably more
time (hundreds of milliseconds to seconds).15 In order to determine if heme reincorporation can occur during nanoESI,
solutions that result in heme reincorporation at equilibrium when
mixed at a 1:1 ratio were mixed using the theta-glass emitters. A
mass spectrum resulting from mixing a solution of acid-denatured holo-Mb
(pH = 2.9; Figure 4a) and a solution of 100
mM aqueous ammonium acetate at a 1:1 ratio is shown in Figure 4b. There is a bimodal charge-state distribution
of apo-Mb centered at 15+ and at 9+ as well as a distribution of holo-Mb
in the 9+ and 8+ charge states. The relative abundances of unfolded
and folded apo-Mb and folded holo-Mb are 50 ± 3%, 13 ± 3%,
and 37 ± 4%, respectively.

Figure 4 Mass spectra of (a) acid-denatured holo-Mb
(pH = 2.9), (b) acid-denatured
holo-Mb mixed with a 100 mM aqueous ammonium acetate solution at a
1:1 ratio (pH = 4.7), and (c) acid-denatured holo-Mb mixed with the
ammonium acetate solution using a theta-glass emitter (estimated pH
= 4.9). The percentage in (c) is the relative abundance of the folded
fraction (7–9+ charge states) of apo-Mb.

A nanoESI mass spectrum resulting from mixing the acidified
solution
(Figure 4a) with the 100 mM aqueous ammonium
acetate solution using a theta-glass emitter is shown in Figure 4c. There is a bimodal charge-state distribution
of apo-Mb centered at 16+ and ∼8+, corresponding to unfolded
and folded forms of the protein, respectively. The initial pH of the
mixed droplets is ∼4.9, and the folded form of the protein
comprises 25 ± 9% of myoglobin, consistent with the results from
solutions without heme present (25 ± 2%, Figure 3e). No holo-Mb is observed despite the presence of both a
globular apo-Mb conformer and the heme group in solution. This result
indicates that heme reincorporation does not occur to an appreciable
extent within the nanoESI droplet, which is consistent with the droplet
lifetime of ∼9 μs measured using the refolding of apo-Mb
and the heme reincorporation time constant on the order of hundreds
of milliseconds to seconds.15

Temperature
of NanoESI Droplets
Fragments of ions formed
by ESI can be observed in some ESI mass spectra, and this has led
some to conclude that the ESI process itself activates ions.38−42 For example, Vékey and co-workers concluded from the extent
of fragmentation of benzylpyridinium salts during ESI compared to
that predicted by RRKM calculations at various temperatures that electrospray
ionization produces ions with internal temperatures greater than 200
°C.38,39 The potential used to produce ions in ESI
can result in droplet heating, such as in electrothermal supercharging,
wherein high charge states of protein ions are formed from buffered
aqueous solutions.12,13 However, extensively hydrated
ions can also be directly produced using ESI, and evaporative cooling
significantly reduces the temperatures of these clusters.43−46 Results for trivalent atomic ions show that these ions require approximately
18 water molecules to be stable, indicating that these clusters are
formed by evaporative cooling of even larger clusters and not by condensation
of water onto minimally solvated or bare ions.46 Because preservation of weakly bound water molecules can
only occur in ESI droplets that are not significantly heated, these
results show that the ESI process itself is not activating, although
activation can occur either in the ESI droplet or after ion formation
as a result of instrumental conditions.

Apo-Mb thermally denatures
between about 60 and 70 °C in unbuffered aqueous solutions.20 The folding of this protein during nanoESI shown
here (Figures 2e and 3c) indicates that the droplet temperature in these experiments must
be less than 70 °C. This result shows that the droplet temperature
in ESI can be lower than the melting point of some proteins. In sum,
these results indicate that ESI droplets can have low temperatures
and that ion formation by ESI is intrinsically soft under appropriate
experimental conditions.

Folding Cytochrome c During
NanoESI
In low ionic strength aqueous solutions, cytochrome c (cyt c) is unfolded with little secondary
structure
at pH = 2 but has a native folded structure between pH = 3 and 7.47,48 A globular form, known as the A state, can form at high salt concentrations
(0.2 M),49,50 and a partially folded intermediate structure
may also form during folding in salt-free solutions.51,52 A mass spectrum of cyt c in an aqueous solution
with 2.5% formic acid (pH = 2.0) is shown in Figure 5a. The charge-state distribution is bimodal, with a low-abundance
distribution between 7+ and 9+ corresponding to a folded structure
(11 ± 4% of cyt c) and a high-abundance distribution
between 10+ and 18+ corresponding to unfolded structures in solution.
This solution was mixed with a solution of 500 mM aqueous ammonium
acetate at a 1:1 ratio (pH = 4.2), and a mass spectrum of the resulting
solution is shown in Figure 5b. The 6–8+
charge states are formed and comprise 98 ± 0% of cyt c in the mass spectra. The 14+ charge state is also present
at low abundance. These results indicate that cyt c has predominantly adopted a folded structure in this solution at
equilibrium.

solution

with a 500 mM aqueous ammonium acetate solution at a 1:1 ratio (pH
= 4.2), and (c) this formic acid solution mixed with the ammonium
acetate solution using a theta-glass emitter (estimated pH = 4.2).

with water at a 1:1 ratio (pH = 2.9), and (f) this acetic acid solution
mixed with water using a theta-glass emitter (estimated pH = 2.9).
Percentages are the relative abundances of the fraction of cyt c in charge states corresponding to folded conformers (denoted
with ∗).

A mass spectrum resulting
from mixing these two solutions using
a theta-glass emitter is shown in Figure 5c.
The charge state distribution is bimodal, with one distribution between
6+ and 8+ corresponding to a folded structure (21 ± 1% of cyt c) and another between 9+ and 17+ corresponding to an unfolded
structure. The initial folding step of cyt c occurs
with a time constant of ∼57 μs,47 and other steps may also occur with time constants at or above 600
μs.52−54 The droplet lifetime of <27 μs reported
previously24 and the 9 μs lifetime
obtained here for the folding of apo-Mb indicate that only the 57
μs folding step of cyt c is likely to occur
to a significant extent in these experiments. The abundances of the
folded cyt c conformer in the unmixed, equilibrium,
and rapid mixing experiments (Figure 5a–c,
respectively) and the 57 μs time constant are used to obtain
a reaction time of 7 ± 3 μs from eq 1. This result is remarkably similar to the reaction time of 9 ±
2 μs obtained for the folding of apo-Mb during the nanoESI process.

Slightly different solution conditions were used in these experiments
than those in which the protein folding time constants were obtained,
which may affect the droplet lifetimes reported here. The time constant
for the initial collapse of apo-Mb was measured in a pH = 5.9 solution
containing 10 mM sodium acetate20 and the
folding time constant of cyt c in a pH = 4.5 solution
containing 25 mM sodium phosphate and 25 mM sodium acetate.47 In this study, apo-Mb and cyt c were folded in droplets containing higher salt concentrations (∼50
and ∼250 mM ammonium acetate, respectively) and slightly lower
initial pHs (pH = 4.7 and 4.2, respectively). The different solution
compositions likely result in slightly different protein-folding time
constants in the nanoESI droplets than were measured in those bulk
solution experiments. However, the remarkable agreement in reaction
times obtained for apo-Mb and cyt c in the rapid
mixing experiments indicates a relatively small uncertainty in the
measured reaction times despite the different solution conditions
used to obtain the folding time constants.

Between pH = 2 and
3, the unfolded and globular forms of cyt c coexist
in equilibrium.48 The
equilibrium distribution of partially acid-denatured cyt c can be shifted toward the folded conformer by diluting the solution
with water. In the nanoESI mass spectrum of cyt c at pH = 2.8 (1.0% acetic acid in water, Figure 5d), the charge-state distribution is bimodal, with one distribution
centered at 8+ corresponding to a folded structure (34 ± 7% of
cyt c) and another distribution centered at 16+ corresponding
to an unfolded structure. Results from mixing this solution with water
at a 1:1 ratio (pH = 2.9) are shown in Figure 5e. The same charge-state distributions are observed, but the relative
abundances of these distributions indicate that 76 ± 5% of cyt c is in the folded form. This result shows that the equilibrium
distribution between the two forms of cyt c shifts
toward the globular structure in this solution.

A nanoESI mass
spectrum resulting from mixing these two solutions
using a theta-glass emitter is shown in Figure 5f. The same charge-state distributions are observed, and the relative
abundances of these distributions indicate that the folded form comprises
49 ± 7% of cyt c. From the abundances of the
globular cyt c conformer in the unmixed, equilibrium,
and rapid mixing experiments (Figure 5d–f,
respectively) and a folding time constant of 57 μs for cyt c,47 a reaction time of 25 ±
7 μs is obtained from eq 1. This reaction
time is about 3-fold higher than the reaction times for the folding
of myoglobin (9 ± 2 μs) and of cyt c from
the acidified solution mixed with 500 mM aqueous ammonium acetate
(7 ± 3 μs).

The shorter droplet lifetime deduced
from the experiments in which
ammonium acetate is used to increase the initial pH of the droplets
may be due to uncertainties associated with the folding time constants
measured under slightly different conditions. It may also be a result
of faster water evaporation or of differences in the temperatures
of the nanodrops. Emission of water-solvated ammonium ions from the
droplet55,56 could result in an increased rate of droplet
evaporation and, hence, a shorter droplet lifetime. The presence of
ammonium acetate may also affect the droplet temperature,57 which would affect the protein-folding time
constants.37,58

Conclusions
Theta-glass
emitters were used to rapidly mix two solutions in
order to induce either protein folding or unfolding during nanoESI.
Acid-denatured myoglobin was mixed with a solution of ammonium acetate
to increase pH and induce folding both with and without heme present
in solution. The extents of folding in these experiments compared
to those obtained at equilibrium indicates a reaction time of 9 ±
2 μs, which is an upper limit to the droplet lifetime because
some folding will occur in the Taylor cone prior to droplet formation.
Reincorporation of the heme into the folded protein structure does
not occur, consistent with the much longer time constant of hundreds
of milliseconds to seconds for this process.15 Similarly, droplet lifetimes of 7 ± 3 and 25 ± 7 μs,
depending on solution compositions, were obtained from folding experiments
with cyt c. These results indicate that the nanoESI
droplet lifetime can be very short and that the droplets are not heated
past the melting points of many proteins7,20 under appropriate
experimental conditions.

The extent of unfolding of holo-Mb
obtained in the rapid mixing
experiments in this study is less than that reported earlier,23 a result that is consistent with the much smaller
tips used in the current experiments. These results indicate that
the time frame for reactions to occur during the nanoESI process can
be readily controlled by changing the emitter tip diameter or other
properties that affect the initial size of the nanoESI droplets. Thus,
it should be possible to acquire “snapshots” of protein
folding or unfolding at various time points by varying the diameter
of the tips of the theta-glass emitters.

The extent of sodium
ion adduction to the folded forms of protein
ions resulting from rapidly mixing proteins in buffered aqueous solutions
with acidified solutions using the theta-glass emitters is less than
in protein ions generated from native solutions. This is likely the
result of the much higher concentration of protons that can displace
sodium ions at the protein surface during nanoESI. This may be an
effective way to reduce sodium adduction in native MS without significantly
affecting the resulting protein ion structure if the unfolding time
of the protein is significantly greater than the time frame for ion
formation in nanoESI.
