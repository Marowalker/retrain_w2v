One
of the challenges in proteomics is the proteome’s complexity,
which necessitates the fractionation of proteins prior to the mass
spectrometry (MS) analysis. Despite recent advances in top-down proteomics,
separation of intact proteins remains challenging. Hydrophobic interaction
chromatography (HIC) appears to be a promising method that provides
high-resolution separation of intact proteins, but unfortunately the
salts conventionally used for HIC are incompatible with MS. In this
study, we have identified ammonium tartrate as a MS-compatible salt
for HIC with comparable separation performance as the conventionally
used ammonium sulfate. Furthermore, we found that the selectivity
obtained with ammonium tartrate in the HIC mobile phases is orthogonal
to that of reverse phase chromatography (RPC). By coupling HIC and
RPC as a novel two-dimensional chromatographic method, we have achieved
effective high-resolution intact protein separation as demonstrated
with standard protein mixtures and a complex cell lysate. Subsequently,
the separated intact proteins were identified by high-resolution top-down
MS. For the first time, these results have shown the high potential
of HIC as a high-resolution protein separation method for top-down
proteomics.

==== Body
Top-down proteomics promises a
full description of the proteome including the identification, characterization,
and quantification of various proteoforms arising from genetic variations,
alternatively spliced RNA transcripts, and post-translational modifications.1−6 Thus, it has high potential for elucidation of cellular pathways,
disease mechanisms, and biomarker discovery, as showcased by recent
studies using single proteins and simple protein mixtures.3,7−12 However, challenges remain to enable top-down proteomics for routine
proteome-wide investigation to the same extent as bottom-up proteomics.
One of the challenges is the proteome’s complexity, which necessitates
the fractionation of intact proteins prior to the mass spectrometry
(MS) analysis.12 While effective methods
exist for fractionation of small peptides in the bottom-up approach,
separation of intact proteins remains challenging despite recent advances
in top-down proteomics studies.1,13−19 Most protein separation/purification methods employ salts and/or
detergents that are incompatible with MS.12 Hence, new chromatographic methods for effective high-resolution
protein separations that are compatible with top-down MS are needed.

Hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC)20−23 appears to be the chromatography
mode that provides high-resolution separation of the greatest number
of intact protein samples.24 HIC is a nondenaturing
mode that separates proteins based on the differences in hydrophobicity
on the surface of their tertiary structures.21,22 Proteins are eluted in the order of increasing surface hydrophobicity
by decreasing the salt concentration of the mobile phase. The salt
concentration in HIC can be conveniently manipulated to ensure retention
of hydrophilic proteins and elution of hydrophobic ones. Scheme 1 compares HIC with the other modes of chromatography
that are sensitive to differences in polarity: reverse phase chromatography
(RPC), hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC), and normal
phase chromatography (NPC). A unique advantage of HIC is that it is
a very mild method for high-resolution protein separation in a nondenaturing
mode and preserves proteins’ tertiary structure and biological
activity.25,26 Moreover, the selectivity of HIC is complementary
to those of other chromatographic modes such as ion exchange (IEC),
size exclusion (SEC), and affinity chromatography.25 Unfortunately, proteins are best retained in HIC with high
concentrations of nonvolatile salts high in the Hofmeister (lyotropic)
series (which classifies ions in order of their ability to salt-out
or salt-in proteins), such as ammonium sulfate and sodium sulfate,27 rendering HIC incompatible with direct MS analysis.
On the other hand, salts more compatible with and commonly employed
for MS, such as ammonium acetate, are much less able to order the
structure of water in their solutions,28 so the retention of proteins with such salts is weak. Therefore,
if we could identify a salt that can confer good retention of proteins
in HIC yet does not interfere with MS analysis, we would enable the
effective application of HIC to top-down proteomics.

Polarity

In this study, we have identified ammonium tartrate
[(NH4)2C4H4O6] as a MS-compatible salt that affords high-resolution protein separations
in HIC comparable to those obtained with the commonly used ammonium
sulfate. Furthermore, we found that HIC with ammonium tartrate in
the mobile phase is orthogonal to RPC, despite the fact that retention
via both methods is based on hydrophobicity. RPC is the most popular
MS-friendly separation method, permitting direct online MS analysis
after RPC separation. So it is commonly used as the last dimension
before MS, often coupled with IEC,29,30 SEC,16 and more recently HILIC.31 Here, we have coupled HIC with RPC as a novel two-dimensional
chromatographic method and achieved effective high-resolution intact
protein separation, as demonstrated with standard protein mixtures
and a complex cell lysate. Subsequently, the separated intact proteins
were identified by top-down MS. For the first time, with the assistance
of ammonium tartrate as the mobile phase salt, we have overcome the
challenge of MS-compatibility due to the high concentration of nonvolatile
salts in HIC and demonstrated the high potential of HIC for top-down
proteomics.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Reagents
All reagents
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. (St. Louis, MO) unless noted
otherwise. HPLC grade water and acetonitrile were purchased from Fisher
Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ), and BugBuster master mix cell lysis buffer
was purchased from EMD Millipore (Novagen, Billerica, MA).

Sample
Preparation
Standard protein samples (Apr, aprotinin from
bovine lung; Cyt, cytochrome C from equine heart; RiA, ribonuclease
A from bovine pancreas; Myo, myoglobin from equine heart; RiB, ribonuclease
B from bovine pancreas; ChA, α-chymotrypsinogen A from bovine
pancreas; Chy, α-chymotrypsin from bovine pancreas; Oval, ovalbumin
from chicken egg white; BSA, albumin from bovine serum; Con, conalbumin
from chicken egg white) were used without further purification. For
HIC, all standard protein samples were first prepared in 10 mg/mL
with HPLC-grade water and subsequently diluted to 0.1–1.5 μg/μL.
For RPC-MS, the optimized concentration of each standard protein was
0.1–0.2
μg/μL in the four-protein mixture (BSA, Myo, Oval, and
ChA) and six-protein mixture (Cyt, Myo, Con, Oval, RiA and RiB), and
1 μL of sample was injected on the RP column for separation.

Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells from the BL21 strain grown in-house
were lysed in BugBuster master mix cell lysis buffer wherein 1 mL
of buffer was added to 200 mg of E. coli cells followed by the addition of protease and phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail and PMSF (100 mM). The lysed cells were resuspended, vortexed,
and then shaken for an hour at 4 °C. The resulting lysate was
centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 13.2 rpm, and the supernatant
solution comprising the complex mixture of E. coli cell lysate soluble proteins was utilized for further chromatographic
separations. The pellet was discarded.

Hydrophobic Interaction
Chromatography (HIC)
HIC was performed on a Shimadzu HPLC
system (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments Inc., Columbia, MD) equipped
with a PolyPROPYL A column (100 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., 3 μm,
1500 Å; PolyLC Inc., Columbia, MD). Ammonium acetate, ammonium
sulfate, and ammonium tartrate were utilized as salts for HIC separation
of standard protein samples; only ammonium tartrate was used for HIC
of E. coli cell lysate samples. Mobile
phase A (MPA) and mobile phase B (MPB) contain 1.8 M and 20 mM salt,
respectively. Both solutions were adjusted with 10% ammonium hydroxide
(NH4OH) solution to pH 7.0. Typically, a 30 min linear
gradient (from 100% MPA to 100% MPB) was utilized to elute proteins
followed by MPB isocratically for 5 min to ensure elution, at a flow
rate of 1 mL/min. All samples were diluted with MPA at the volume
ratio 1:1 to avoid injection viscosity differences. For standard protein
samples, the gradient profile was slightly optimized to achieve a
better separation: two isocratic regions from 12 to 14.5 min (at the
proportion of 48.3% MPB) and 15 to 19 min (63.3% MPB) were interjected.
The sample injection volume was 50 μL. Baseline subtraction
was performed for all HIC chromatograms. Other chromatographic conditions
are given in the figure legends.

Reverse Phase Chromatography
(RPC)
RPC was performed on a Thermo EASY nano-LC 1000 system
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a PicoFrit PLRP-S column
(100 mm × 100 μm i.d., 5 μm, 1000 Å; New Objective,
Inc., Woburn, MA). The following buffers were used for RPC: buffer
A, water with 0.25% formic acid; buffer B, acetonitrile with 0.25%
formic acid. The nano-LC was operated at a flow rate of 500 nL/min,
and 1 μL of sample was injected with an autosampler after equilibration
of the capillary column. For the separation of both standard proteins
and E. coli cell lysate proteins, an
80
min optimized RPC gradient was used consisting of the following concentrations
of buffer B: 5% for 15 min, 25% at 25 min, 60% at 70 min, 95% at 75
min, and then back to 5% at 80 min. Prior to injection on the RPC
column, a brief desalting procedure (three times with 10 kDa ultracentrifugal
filters) was performed on both the E. coli cell lysate fractions after HIC with ammonium tartrate salt gradient
and standard proteins prepared in 1.8 M ammonium tartrate buffer to
remove a substantial amount of salt.

Top-down MS Analysis
For online nano-LC/MS/MS experiments, samples were electrosprayed32 with a “nanoflex” ionization source
into a Q Exactive benchtop Orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher
Scientific, Bremen, Germany).33,34 Heated metal capillary
temperature and s-lens voltage were experimentally optimized to 300
°C and 50 V, respectively, for more energetic front-end source
conditions for improved sensitivity, ion transmission, and reduced
adduction.35−39 Both LC/MS and LC/MS/MS data were collected with five micro scans
at a high mass resolving power of 140 000 (theoretical maximum
resolving power setting on QE: m/Δm50% = 140 000 at m/z 200, in which Δm50% denotes mass
spectral peak full width at half-maximum peak height) and 70 000,
respectively. In top two data-dependent MS/MS scans, the intact protein
ions are injected into the collision cell for higher-energy collision
dissociation (HCD)40,41 at a previously optimized setting
of 23 V, and all ions moved back into the C-trap and then into the
Orbitrap for analysis. Here, intact protein ions with greater than
8 positive charges were quadrupole-isolated for HCD, and other ions with fewer
charges were discounted. Data were collected with Xcalibur 2.2 software
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany), and the total RPC-MS
data acquisition period was 80 min per sample.

Protein Identification
Raw top two data-dependent MS data collected by Xcalibur were first
processed with MS-Deconv, a combinatorial algorithm42 for reliable isotopic distribution deconvolution and charge
state assignment43 for all the observed
ions to generate MSAlign files containing monoisotopic mass, intensity,
and charge. These MSAlign files were then subsequently searched with
the E. coli BL21 database generated
from NCBI (accession: PRJEA161949, containing 4192 protein sequences)
with the alignment-based MS-Align+ algorithm for protein identifications
based on protein-spectrum matches.44 Here,
10 ppm fragment mass tolerance searches were conducted for the assignment
of b and y ions. Protein identification
results with statistically significant lower P and E values (<0.00005) and a satisfactorily higher fragment
number (at least 10 fragments assigned) were manually validated.

Results and Discussion
Identification of Ammonium Tartrate as a
MS-Compatible Salt for HIC
To identify a salt that combines
MS compatibility downstream with high-resolution separation, a set
of standard proteins was used initially. First, we used the commonly
used HIC salt, ammonium sulfate, to optimize separation conditions
and demonstrate the excellent retention and selectivity for proteins
in HIC.27 An overlay of individual injections
of the 10 standard proteins reveals satisfactory peak shapes for a
majority of the proteins (Figure 1a). Inspired
by the excellent performance of ammonium tartrate as a MS-compatible
additive for top-down MS of large proteins,45 and considering the fact that tartrate is high in the Hofmeister
series, we hypothesized that ammonium tartrate could be adapted for
use in HIC as a potential MS-compatible salt. Accordingly, we assessed
its HIC performance via individual injections of the same set of 10
standard proteins with ammonium tartrate as the salt (Figure 1b). The results were comparable to those obtained
with ammonium sulfate (Figure 1a). The similarities
of sulfate and tartrate can be partially explained by the Hofmeister
(lyotropic) series, which categorizes ions in order of their ability
to precipitate (salt-out) or solubilize (salt-in) proteins.27,28,46,47 Sulfate and tartrate are similarly positioned in the Hofmeister
series, and both are doubly charged anions effective for salting-out
proteins. They can interact very unfavorably with hydrocarbon groups
on proteins and therefore stabilize folded proteins relative to the
unfolded form in which more hydrocarbon groups are exposed.27,28,46−48 For the purpose
of serving as effective HIC salts, other properties, such as the acid–base
dissociation constant (thus the pH values of the mobile phase) and
the solubility, are also important factors.

These two salts were
compared further with a mixture of four of the protein standards (“4-mix”;
BSA, Myo, Oval, and ChA) and 10 of the standards (“10-mix”;
all ten of the protein standards featured in Figure 1). The concentration of each protein was the same as the concentration
with individual injections. Standard proteins in the 4-mix and 10-mix
samples (Figure 2) were identified according
to retention time in reference to the individual protein injections
in Figure 1. Similar separation profiles were
obtained for HIC using ammonium sulfate (Figure 2a,b) as compared to ammonium tartrate (Figure 2c,d), for 4-mix and 10-mix, respectively. Nearly all proteins were
baseline separated for 4-mix (Figure 2a,c),
whereas only a portion of proteins was separated in 10-mix (Figure 2b,d). The less hydrophobic proteins (Cyt, Myo, RiA,
and RiB) tend to coelute under the conditions used here.

tartrate (c,d), and ammonium acetate (e,f). HIC UV-chromatograms of
4-mix sample is shown in the left column (a, c, and e) and 10-mix
sample is depicted in the right column (b, d, and f). Conditions:
same as shown in Figure 1.

We further compared the performance of ammonium tartrate
with ammonium acetate, a commonly used MS-friendly salt, for HIC.
A clear contrast was found in chromatograms of both 4-mix (Figure 2c,e) and 10-mix (Figure 2d,f). Ammonium acetate failed to retain any proteins resulting in
an extremely high intensity peak due to the coelution of the entire
protein mixture at the beginning of the chromatography runs. This
can be explained by acetate ion’s low position in the Hofmeister
series,27 denoting relatively poor water-structuring
power. Thus, despite its compatibility with MS, ammonium acetate is
not suitable for use as a salt with a conventional HIC stationary
phase, as has been noted before.49

Next, we investigated the MS-compatibility of ammonium tartrate in
the online LC/MS mode compared with the conventional HIC salt, ammonium
sulfate. Standard proteins were prepared in the mobile phase containing
1.8 M (the highest concentration used in HIC fractions) ammonium tartrate
or ammonium sulfate and then desalted briefly by an ultracentrifugation
step with a 10-kDa filter (3 cycles) prior to RPC/MS analysis. Significant
sulfate adducts of 98 Da and concomitant reduced S/N were observed
for standard proteins prepared in ammonium sulfate (representative
spectra shown in Figure 3a and Figure S-1a). In contrast, high quality spectra
with no adduction and improved S/N were obtained for the same standard
proteins from the solution of ammonium tartrate (Figure 3b and Figure S-1b). Ammonium tartrate
(0.5–25
mM) has been previously utilized as an additive in direct infusion
mode for improved top-down dissociation of large intact proteins (∼200
kDa) by McLafferty and co-workers45 as
well as for reduction of sodium ion adduction on protein ions in native
MS by Williams and co-workers.38 We have
confirmed the MS-compatibility of ammonium tartrate via direct infusion
of standard proteins in various concentration of ammonium tartrate
(up to 50 mM), and the resulting ESI/FTMS spectra yield clean charge
state distribution without any adduction (data not shown). These results
further underscore the MS-compatibility of ammonium tartrate.

HIC and RPC Orthogonality
Since it is likely that no single
dimension of LC suffices to resolve complex protein mixtures, we sought
to employ a second dimension of LC after the first dimension separation
by HIC. RPC is commonly used as the second (or last) dimension of
chromatographic separation prior to MS. Although both HIC and RPC
separate proteins based on difference in hydrophobicity, selectivity
in RPC differs from HIC because the conditions of RPC denature proteins,
giving the column access to a different set of hydrophobic residues
than is available in the nondenaturing mode of HIC. This provides
the possibility of orthogonality between HIC and RPC. These two modes
also use different mobile phases with different polarity (as illustrated
in Scheme 1). Thus, we evaluated the possibility
of coupling HIC with RPC for two-dimensional chromatographic separation
using standard protein mixtures. A mixture of four proteins, specifically
Myo, Oval, BSA, and ChA, was nicely separated by HIC with ammonium
tartrate as the salt (Figure 4a), whereas RPC
was unable to separate the same protein mixture (Figure 4c), especially BSA and ChA. On the other hand, another protein
mixture, containing Cyt, Myo, RiA, RiB, Oval, and Con could not be
resolved in HIC (Figure 4b) but was successfully
separated by RPC (Figure 4d). These results
confirm the complementary selectivity of the two modes.

by linearly increasing MPB to 25% in 10 min, then to 60% linearly
in 45 min, to 95% in the next 5 min, and finally decreased to 5% in
5 min. Total: 80 min.

HIC/RPC/Top-down MS for Identification for E. coli Proteins
This HIC-RPC-MS sequence was next applied to a
more complex mixture of an E. coli cell
lysate. Proteins were eluted with a decreasing ammonium tartrate salt
gradient, and fractions were collected every minute (Figure 5a). To demonstrate proof-of-principle for this combination,
we focused on HIC fraction 2 for the subsequent RPC/MS analysis since
the early HIC fractions contain a very high concentration of ammonium
tartrate (∼1.7 M), which appears to be more challenging to
handle than the later fractions. Fraction 1 was not chosen because
it contained highly abundant peptides that are not retained by HIC.
The RPC total ion current (TIC) chromatogram obtained for HIC fraction
2 clearly shows baseline separation of a number of proteins, demonstrating
the power of the two-dimensional separation (Figure 5b). The online RPC/MS analysis shows high-resolution MS measurement
of intact proteins without adduct formation. Representative data for
three proteins, 15.7 kDa, 22.9 kDa, and 32.1 kDa, are shown in Figure 5c,d. At the resolving power utilized, isotopic clusters
for intact proteins up to ∼32 kDa were clearly evident on the
Q Exactive MS. The experimental and calculated isotopic distributions
agree well for observed intact proteins (Figure 5d). The MASH-suite software50 was used
to generate the calculated isotopic distribution based on the observed
molecular weights and averaging model.43 Generally, proteins below ∼20 kDa are isotopically resolved
in a single LC-MS scan at maximum resolving power setting (140 K at m/z 200) on the Q Exactive, but one needs
to signal-average more scans to clearly define the isotopic distribution
of larger proteins and improve S/N. Here, 5, 10, and 15 scans are
signal-averaged in the chromatographic time scale to improve S/N and
define a Gaussian isotopic distribution as shown for 15.7 kDa, 22.9
kDa, and 32.1 kDa intact proteins, respectively (Figure 5d). The lack of isotopic resolution of large molecular weight
(MW) species beyond 32 kDa might reflect the upper MW limit that can
be resolved online by a Q Exactive because of the exponential decay
in S/N vs increasing MW51 and/or the rapid
decay in the time-domain signal due to overall higher kinetic energies
of ions in the Orbitrap.52

MS analysis of E. coli cell lysate
samples. Representative RPC and MS data from one HIC fraction are
shown. (a) UV-chromatogram obtained for E. coli cell lysate by HIC separation with ammonium tartrate as the gradient

from 100% MPA to 100% MPB. (b) RPC-MS TIC for HIC fraction 2 after

with charge state distributions (no tartrate adduction) and unit mass
isotopic resolution on a chromatography time scale on Q Exactive.

Since accurate MW measurement
of intact protein
mass by MS is not conclusive for unambiguous protein identification,
MS/MS is required to obtain sequence information so to identify the
proteins from the database. Here, we have employed top-2 data-dependent
HCD in the chromatographic time-scale for each HIC fraction separated
by RPC as the second dimension for protein identifications. Similarly
to collisionally activated dissociation (CAD), HCD mostly produces b and y ions by the cleavage of the peptide
backbone amide bond.40,41 Figure 6 illustrates a single scan HCD mass spectrum and also b/y ions, cleavages observed by HCD for two representative E. coli proteins identified by MSAlign+ software44 in HIC fraction 2. For example, LC/MS/MS identified
a protein of 9.5 kDa with a RPC retention time of ∼37 min as
a subunit of HU transcriptional dual regulator protein with a total
of 71 unique b/y fragment ions (Figure 6a). Similarly, a protein of 15.7 kDa at a RPC retention
time of ∼28 min is identified as superoxide dismutase precursor
(Cu–Zn)
protein with a total of 60 unique b/y ions and an N-terminal truncation between two alanine residues (Figure 6b). The fragment ions were isotopically resolved
as exemplified by two fragment ions at m/z of 916 (inset of Figure 6a) and m/z of 2024 (inset of Figure 6b). Noteworthy is the unit mass resolution observed for a
larger fragment (e.g., Y1397+) of ∼14.1
kDa at high mass (>2000 m/z)
in a single MS scan on Q Exactive. Table S-1 lists the proteins with a MW up to 32.1 kDa identified from HIC
fraction 2 using the HIC-RPC-MS sequence. The high numbers of matching
fragments and significantly low P, E values correlate statistically with higher confidence in identification.
These results demonstrate that HIC can be effectively coupled with
RPC and MS/MS for top-down proteomics.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have established a novel and effective HIC-RPC-MS combination
which is promising for overcoming the bottleneck of separation that
has hindered progress in top-down proteomics. Central to this success
is the identification of ammonium tartrate as a salt that is compatible
with MS (in terms of not interfering with downstream MS analysis).
This overcomes the challenges encountered for the commonly used ammonium
sulfate HIC buffer including significant sulfate adduction and concomitant
suppression of the intact protein signal even after extensive desalting.
We further demonstrate that the selectivity of HIC and RPC is orthogonal
and can be utilized to significantly increase the separation power
as demonstrated here for standard protein mixtures and a complex cell
lysate. Hence, for the first time, we demonstrate the high potential
of HIC in coupling with RPC for top-down proteomics.
