13C NMR has many advantages for a metabolomics study,
including a large spectral dispersion, narrow singlets at natural
abundance, and a direct measure of the backbone structures of metabolites.
However, it has not had widespread use because of its relatively low
sensitivity compounded by low natural abundance. Here we demonstrate
the utility of high-quality 13C NMR spectra obtained using
a custom 13C-optimized probe on metabolomic mixtures. A
workflow was developed to use statistical correlations between replicate
1D 13C and 1H spectra, leading to composite
spin systems that can be used to search publicly available databases
for compound identification. This was developed using synthetic mixtures
and then applied to two biological samples, Drosophila melanogaster extracts and mouse serum. Using the synthetic mixtures we were able
to obtain useful 13C–13C statistical
correlations from metabolites with as little as 60 nmol of material.
The lower limit of 13C NMR detection under our experimental
conditions is approximately 40 nmol, slightly lower than the requirement
for statistical analysis. The 13C and 1H data
together led to 15 matches in the database compared to just 7 using 1H alone, and the 13C correlated peak lists had
far fewer false positives than the 1H generated lists.
In addition, the 13C 1D data provided improved metabolite
identification and separation of biologically distinct groups using
multivariate statistical analysis in the D. melanogaster extracts and mouse serum.

==== Body
NMR-based
metabolomics is most
commonly done with 1H detection. Although 13C is often used for compound identification, it is usually recorded
indirectly using experiments such as HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum
correlation), HMBC (heteronuclear multiple bond correlation), or their
variants, all of which employ 1H detection. These indirect
methods are powerful but suffer from the unreliable detection of quaternary
carbons and correlations that are sometimes difficult to assign, especially
with HMBC. Indirect methods also suffer from limited digital resolution
along the large 13C chemical shift dimension. Despite its
widespread use, 1H NMR metabolomics studies of mixtures
are often complicated by resonance overlap from a relatively narrow
10 ppm diamagnetic chemical shift range. This overlap is exacerbated
by 1H homonuclear coupling, which creates multiplets that
can complicate analysis, although 2D J-resolved experiments can improve
that problem. Many 1H chemical shifts are sensitive to
pH, temperature, or salts, complicating spectral alignment and database
matching. In addition, water reduction can obscure nearby resonances
and distort baselines, which can make 1H-based metabolomics
analyses difficult.

13C NMR offers many advantages
for a metabolomics study,
either alone or as a complement to 1H NMR: (1) 13C spectral windows are typically 200 ppm, providing much greater
chemical shift dispersion than 1H; (2) at natural abundance, 13C resonances of small metabolites are narrow singlets (with 1H decoupling) resulting in less spectral overlap; (3) biogenic
metabolites predominantly contain a carbon backbone, and 13C NMR can detect this directly, including quaternary carbons. These
advantages raise the possibility of easier identification of metabolites
and better separation between experimental groups using multivariate
analyses because of better spectral dispersion.

The major obstacle
to 13C NMR metabolomics compared
to 1H is low sensitivity due to low natural abundance of 13C (∼1.1%) combined with a decreased gyromagnetic ratio
γ (one-quarter of that of 1H). Because the energy
of an NMR resonance transition is proportional to γ3, 13C has an intrinsic sensitivity decrease of nearly
64 (43) when compared to 1H. Though solutions
such as isotopic labeling exist,1−5 they can be expensive and are often restricted to targeted metabolomics.
Untargeted studies with 13C labeling are especially challenging
for organisms that cannot be cultured. In addition, isotopic 13C labeling reintroduces the problem of homonuclear couplings,
which complicate 13C spectra. The other solution is to
improve 13C sensitivity, either through higher magnetic
field strengths that improve the Boltzmann polarization,6 a variety of hyperpolarization techniques,7,8 or improved detection with an optimized probe.9 We have designed and built a 1.5 mm high-temperature superconducting
(HTS) 13C optimized probe. This probe has a minimal sample
volume of 35 μL and over 2× greater 13C mass
sensitivity than any commercially available 13C-optimized
cryogenic probe, which translates to well over 4× less measurement
time for the same sample and same signal-to-noise ratio.9 This new technology makes 13C metabolomics
at natural abundance technically feasible.

In the present study
we show that 1D 13C data enhance
metabolite identification and facilitate better separation of groups
for comparison using multivariate statistical analysis when compared
to 1D 1H data alone. We analyzed the 13C and 1H 1D data sets with 13C–13C statistical
total correlation spectroscopy (STOCSY)10,11 and 13C–1H statistical heterospectroscopy (SHY)12−14 to compile correlated peak lists that were then used in database
searches for compound identification. We developed and validated the
workflow using synthetic mixtures of 20 common metabolites, defined
the limits of detection using current technology, and compared the
peak lists generated using both 13C and 1H data
to those generated using 1H data alone. We then applied
our workflow to comparisons of two types of biological mixtures: extracts
of cold hardy and cold susceptible Drosophila melanogaster flies, to demonstrate the superior performance of 1D 13C compared to 1D 1H in multivariate statistical analysis,
and mouse serum taken from control and the Duchenne muscular dystrophy
mouse model, mdx,(15) to
demonstrate the power of 13C metabolomics to not only aid
in metabolite identification but also to prevent misidentification.

Experimental
Methods
Synthetic Mixtures
Synthetic mixtures with known metabolite
compositions were constructed to test the limits of detection of the
probe and our ability to correctly identify known compounds. Two groups
of mixtures (groups A and B, five replicates each) were each made
using 20 common synthetic metabolites ranging in concentration from
1 to 5 mM (Table 1). The first 10 metabolites
were at equal concentrations in all mixtures in both groups, and the
remaining 10 metabolites differed between groups with half higher
in group A and half higher in group B (Table 1). Rather than prepare a uniform batch to eliminate concentration
differences between samples, each metabolite was pipetted individually
into each mixture. This was to increase the random mixture-to-mixture
variation of individual metabolites both within and between groups
due to pipetting errors. This random variation between samples allowed
us to develop and validate the statistical methods (i.e., STOCSY)
used in this study. Variation was not controlled in this experiment
and is assumed to be random. Each sample was brought to 50 μL
using 99% D2O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories), of which
40 μL was pipetted into a 1.5 mm (OD) NMR tube (Norell).

Drosophila melanogaster Tissue Extracts
Flies were
selected in the laboratory for high (hardy) or low (susceptible)
cold hardiness (Williams et al., unpublished results). Flies were
lyophilized and weighed prior to metabolite extraction. Polar-phase
metabolites were extracted from homogenized fly tissue using an aqueous-optimized
metabolite extraction protocol.16 Twenty
replicates of each genetic line (cold hardy and cold tolerant) were
collected with 40 flies per replicate. Polar phase extracted metabolites
were dried and reconstituted in 40 μL of 99% D2O
(Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) and pipetted into 1.5 mm NMR tubes
(Norell).

Mouse Serum
The Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) mouse
model, mdx, has previously been investigated with
metabolomics using tissue extracts, but to our knowledge, serum has
not been investigated using both 1H and 13C.
One technical difficulty is the small quantity of sample available
for NMR in mouse serum studies. Mouse measurements were performed
on serum from 6 month old C57/B10 control (n = 6)
and mdx (n = 8) mice. Two hundred
microliters of blood was collected by submandibular puncture, clotted,
and centrifuged to extract serum. The mice were then humanely euthanized
under 2% isofluorane anesthesia according to approved IACUC protocols.
Once the serum was separated from the red blood cells, it was flash
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Approximately
100 μL of serum was lyophilized and resuspended in 40 μL
of 99% D2O and transferred into 1.5 mm NMR tubes (Norell).

NMR Data Collection and Processing
One-dimensional 1H and 13C spectra were collected on an Agilent
VNMRS-600 spectrometer using a custom 1.5 mm 13C high-temperature
superconducting (HTS) probe.9 Synthetic
mixture and fly extract 1H 1D data were collected in ∼2.5
min using a simple pulse sequence with presaturation of residual water,
a spectral width of 12 ppm (7183.9 Hz), an observe frequency of 599.68
MHz, a 2.0 s relaxation delay, a 45° pulse, and 2.3 s acquisition
time. Mouse serum 1H data were collected in 18 min using
a Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG) sequence,
to remove the protein signal contribution resulting in a flat baseline.
Mouse data were recorded with a spectral width of 16 ppm (9615.4 Hz),
a 2.0 s relax delay, a 90° initial pulse, a train of 124 180°
pulses with a 1 ms interpulse delay, and a 2.0 s acquisition time.
All 13C spectra were collected under conditions that favor
nuclei with short T1 relaxation times to maximize overall
sensitivity and minimize measurement time: a 60° pulse with a 0.1 s relaxation delay and a 0.8 s acquisition time.
The total time for each 13C spectrum was ∼2 h, with
a 212 ppm (32051.3 Hz) spectral window and a carrier frequency of
98.0 ppm at a frequency of 150.79 MHz. The mouse serum 13C CPMG sequence used a 90° excitation pulse followed by a train
of 18 180° pulses with a 1 ms interpulse delay. All 13C spectra were recorded using continuous 1H decoupling
at 599.68 MHz with a power of 37 dB using WALTZ-16. All NMR spectra
were processed in NMRPipe.17 All 1H spectra were processed using a cosine-squared window function,
zero-filled 2×, Fourier-transformed, and baseline-corrected. 13C spectra were processed using an exponential window function
with a 2 Hz line broadening, zero-filled 2×, Fourier-transformed,
and baseline-corrected. The synthetic mixture and fly extract 1H spectra were referenced to TSP (0.0 ppm); mouse serum 1H spectra were referenced to the lactate peak at 4.1 ppm,
because TSP binds to proteins. 13C spectra were referenced
to the anomeric carbon glucose peak at 98.64 ppm.

Fourier-transformed
and referenced spectra were imported into an in-house MATLAB Metabolomics
Toolbox that has been developed in our laboratory. This Toolbox is
a collection of MATLAB scripts that includes various analytical tools
for the alignment, normalization, scaling, and multivariate analysis
of complex data. The Metabolomics Toolbox has several options for
alignment, but we found that the star alignment algorithm where an
individual spectrum is chosen as a “star” to which all
other spectra are aligned,18 gave the best
results in this study. For the statistical correlations, we binned
the 1H spectra using an open source optimized bucketing
algorithm described by Sousa et al.1913C spectra were peak picked by setting all resonances below
2× the standard deviation of all spectra to zero, finding local
maxima, and then merging peaks within 0.2 ppm together. Optimal normalization
and scaling methods were specific for each data set. 13C and 1H spectra of the synthetic mixtures and mice serum
were normalized using probabilistic quotient normalization20 (PQN) and scaled using pareto scaling.21 PQN can be used with NMR spectra in the absence
of a reliable internal standard. Pareto scaling is similar to autoscaling
except that it keeps more to the original data set and is less susceptible
to noise. This prevents the high-intensity peaks from dominating our
models. 1H fly spectra were normalized to TSP (an internal
standard) and scaled using range scaling.21 Range scaling is also similar to autoscaling by allowing all metabolites
to become equally important. Unlike autoscaling, it uses the biological
range as a scaling factor. This is useful for exploratory analysis
as in our experiments and multivariate statistical analysis were performed
with no previous knowledge of the contents of our fly mixtures. Range
scaling has been shown to give biologically sensible results.21 Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted
on the 1D 1H and 13C data sets of the synthetic
mixtures and fly samples. Partial least-squares-discriminant analysis
(PLS-DA) was conducted on the 1D 1H and 13C
data sets of the both the fly samples and mouse serum. All NMR raw
data, processing scripts, and MATLAB code were deposited in the Metabolomics
Workbench database (http://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/) supported by the NIH Common Fund.

Data Analysis
Our workflow consisted of computing statistical
correlations to compile peak lists, followed by database searching
to identify metabolites (Figure 1). All of
the steps described below were implemented in an in-house MATLAB Metabolomics
Toolbox22 that was used to analyze all
the data sets.

1 Statistical Correlations
We calculated
2D statistical correlation maps for 13C–13C and 1H–1H homonuclear (STOCSY:10,11 Figure 1C) and 1H–13C heteronuclear spectra (SHY:12−14 Figure 1D). In 1D versions of STOCSY and SHY, correlations and covariance
are determined for a specific “driver” peak of interest.
In the 2D implementation used here, each peak serves as a driver for
all other resonances in the spectra, as shown in panels C and D in
Figure 1.

2 Generation
of Peak Lists
The STOCSY
and SHY maps were analyzed by an in-house script written in MATLAB
according to the following steps. We first systematically evaluated
all 13C Pearson correlations and covariances from the STOCSY
and removed any that were not greater than 0. Thus, all peak lists
were constructed from the positive 13C 2D correlation map,
as shown in Figure 1C. We systematically examined
all 13C frequencies along the vertical STOCSY axis—now
considered “driver peaks”—for every 13C and 1H resonance along the horizontal axes of the STOCSY
and SHY, respectively (Figure 1E). A starting
point for peak lists for database searching was generated by compiling
list of peaks that covary with the driver peak by ±half the covariance
of the driver peak with itself. This was done to eliminate resonances
that have a high correlation but a low covariance with the driver
peak. In addition, if the significance (q) of a correlation
was less than 0.05 after FDR correction,23 that peak was removed to further eliminate resonances that are unlikely
to be part of the same molecule (Figure 1F).
The remaining peaks (Figure 1G) had both significantly
high correlation and a strong covariance with the driver peak. Peak
lists from all driver peaks were compared, and those sharing more
than three peaks (both 1H and 13C) were combined
and classified as part of the same metabolite. We found that lists
sharing at least three peaks improved our metabolite coverage. Fewer
shared peaks resulted in fewer but very large peak lists, and more
shared peaks (>3) essentially excludes compounds with fewer carbons.

The 1H–1H STOCSY results (Supporting Information Figure S1) were not as
useful as the 13C–13C STOCSYs, but we
used these with the synthetic mixture to compare the results with 13C to traditional approaches with just 1H.

3 Database Searching
At this stage in
the analysis, the peak lists from step 2 could be analyzed several
ways including de novo compound identification using chemical knowledge
or, for known compounds, matched to a database. We chose to use the
COLMAR query24 search engine and the BMRB
database,25 because the BMRB has a large
number of metabolites with assigned 13C spectra. However,
any search protocol and database with both 1H and 13C NMR data could be used for this step. We note that our
database searches in this study were sequential; namely, we first
searched the 13C data and then searched for 1H data. It would be advantageous in the future to simultaneously
search using all the data. Like all database searches, several possible
matches for each query were returned, and the final step in our analysis
was manual inspection of BMRB spectra overlaid onto our primary data
and covariance maps for final identification.

Results and Discussion
The goal of this paper was to determine the extent to which 1D 13C NMR can significantly enhance an untargeted metabolomics
study. The specific algorithms—STOCSY, SHY, COLMAR query, and
PCA or PLS-DA—were all known and used with little or no modification
but were combined into a workflow that incorporates the 13C data. We used three different test cases to evaluate the workflow
and approach. To develop and validate the method, we first used a
simple synthetic mixture of known compounds. This allowed us to optimize
parameters and define the steps of the overall workflow, as well as
allowing us to estimate a lower practical limit for the amount of
material required with current technology. In order to demonstrate
the robustness of this approach, we applied the workflow to two very
different biological systems, comparing genetically distinct fruit
fly lines with different phenotypic responses to cold and comparing
control mice to those with a known mutation in a gene that causes
muscular dystrophy. The fly data provided an example of several relatively
abundant metabolites that change between groups, and similar animals
have recently been studied using traditional 1H-based NMR
methods, allowing for some comparisons. The mouse serum data validates
that this technique can be used when only very limited quantities
of starting material are available and shows the value of 13C measurements to confirm or reject assignments from 1H data alone.

Workflow Development
We collected and analyzed 1D 13C (Figure 1A) and 1H (Figure 1B) spectra of two groups of synthetic mixtures to
determine the limit of detection for this method and to test our ability
to identify metabolites that we knew were in the samples. The concentration
ranges of metabolites in these mixes were between about 1 and 5 mM;
thus, the total quantity of compounds in each experiment ranged from
40 to 200 nmol. The metabolites at the lower concentrations (indicated
with an asterisk* in Figure 1A) were detectable,
but only with relatively low S/N. However, we were unable to obtain 13C correlations for the resonances with the lowest S/N and
were only able to obtain reliable correlations from compounds at or
above about 1.5 mM. Thus, we conclude that 60 nmol is the lower limit
of material that works for this workflow with the current 13C probe, measurement time, and other NMR parameters. Several ideas
to improve this overall sensitivity are given below.

Figure 1 Overview of approach
to 1H and 13C NMR statistical
analysis of synthetic mixtures. The 1D 13C (A) and 1H (B) spectra were processed, aligned, normalized, and scaled.
Compounds below 1.5 mM (indicated by * in (A)) showed no significant
correlations. 13C–13C STOCSY (C) and 13C–1H SHY (D) maps were then made from all
of the data in (A) and (B). An expansion of the aromatic region of
the 13C–13C STOCSY (C) is shown in H. 13C–13C STOCSY traces of resonances (i.e.,
driver peak (↓) at 114.8 ppm in (E)) were used to generate
peak lists as described in the text. Negatively correlated peaks were
removed (F), and positively correlated peaks with significant correlations
as described in Methods (G) were used as inputs for COLMAR query searches,
which for example, found tryptophan (Trp). Tryptophan 1D 1H and 13C reference spectra from the BMRB (black) are
overlaid on both correlation matrices (C and D) and the expansion
region in (H).

The overall workflow
is illustrated in Figure 1 with the identification
of tryptophan (Trp) in the synthetic
mixtures. The 13C–13C STOCSY and 1H–13C SHY maps were used to generate peak
lists, as described above. One of the correlated peak lists had a
good match to Trp, following COLMAR query of the BMRB database. The
1D BMRB reference spectra of Trp are shown in black on the axes of
plots in Figure 1 to illustrate how the statistical
correlations were used to match the database. A closer look at the 13C–13C STOCSY region between 109.5 and 141.5
ppm showed the strong correlations between the aromatic tryptophan
peaks (red cross-peaks). The trace through the 13C–13C STOCSY at one of the aromatic Trp resonances (114.8 ppm)
illustrates the correlations with other Trp peaks (Figure 1E).

To evaluate the extent to which 13C data improved our
identification of compounds, we compared results using the entire
workflow outlined in Figure 1 with results
that just used 1H–1H STOCSY (Supporting Information Figure S1). Using all
the data (13C and 1H), our workflow returned
36 peak lists but using the 1H data alone returned only
26 peak lists. It must be noted that a peak list is defined as the
set of correlated peaks that pass a given information-quality threshold,
as described above in Methods. Peak lists can be fragments of molecules,
so it is not surprising to have a greater number of peak lists than
detected metabolites in the sample. When we searched the appropriate
BMRB database using COLMAR query (i.e., 13C or 1H), using all of the data we found 15 of the correct compounds in
the list of the top 10 hits from the query, but using just the 1H data we only found 7 of the correct matches (Table 1). Because the 1H and 13C
data were collected from the same samples and the 1H data
had better overall signal-to-noise, we believe that the major factor
underlying the better performance of the 13C data for compound
identification was that the 13C workflow generated fewer
false correlations—defined as a peak in the generated peak
list that is not in the database-matched molecule. In the 1H–1H STOCSY 60% of the peaks were falsely correlated,
but the 13C–13C STOCSY had only 20% false
correlations, as indicated in columns 4 and 5 of Table 1. This large difference in the false correlations results
from the improved resolution in the 13C 1D data. PCA performed
on both 1D 13C (Supporting Information Figure S2A) and 1H (Supporting Information Figure S2B) data sets gave predictably good separation considering
these were artificially made groups. However, it can also be seen
that the loadings from the 13C PCA are much better resolved
than those from the 1H PCA (Supporting
Information Figure S2). This is demonstrated more clearly below
in the fly data. In general, for the synthetic test data set, we found
that the 13C data were much more useful than 1H in generating comprehensive peak lists leading to metabolite identification.
In most instances, the peaks generated from 13C data alone
were enough to successfully match metabolites in the database, and
the 1H data were reserved primarily for verification of
results.

13C NMR Data Yields Improved Group Discrimination
To test our workflow on samples from a biological system, we utilized
two isogenic lines of D. melanogaster, one hardy
and one susceptible to cold exposure. D. melanogaster is a model organism and the subject of many NMR-based metabolomics
studies,26−28 making it desirable to optimize the performance of
NMR-based metabolomics for this species. The lines used here originated
from the same population as the Drosophila Genetic
Reference Panel29 but were selected for
either rapid (hardy) or slow (susceptible) recovery from a cold-induced
coma (a common metric of cold tolerance in insects and other ectotherms).
We used these strains because they have a well-annotated metabolome
as well as robust and stable differences in the metabolome based on
previous 1H NMR measurements (Williams et al., unpublished
results), against which we can evaluate the power of 13C NMR to identify (A) NMR-visible metabolites and (B) metabolites
that discriminate the lines (i.e., a biomarker approach). All data
were independently analyzed and subsequently cross-checked with the
previously annotated 1D and 2D 1H NMR measurements. Detailed
physiological analysis of metabolic changes upon cold exposure will
be presented elsewhere.

Figure 2 Identification of D. melanogaster metabolites
using 1D 13C (A) and 1H NMR (B) data. 13C–13C STOCSY (E) and 2D 13C–1H SHY (F) correlation maps were generated as described in
the text. Slices at 31.69 ppm from the 13C–13C STOCSY (B) and 13C–1H SHY
(D) show the correlations and covariances with that resonance, which
yielded proline in a database search. Proline spectra from the BMRB
(black lines in (C) and (D)) are overlaid onto the 1D 13C STOCSY and 13C–1H SHY to confirm identity.

The 13C (Figure 2A) and 1H (Figure 2B) spectra are plotted in
red (cold hardy) and blue (cold susceptible). As described above,
peak lists defining spin systems from the 13C–13C STOCSY (Figure 2E) and 1H–13C-SHY (Figure 2F) correlations
were used to search the BMRB, which yielded the 13 metabolites given
in Supporting Information Table S1. As
above, the 13C data were more useful than 1H
for database matching. As an example, a slice of the 2D 13C–1H SHY with 13C driver peak 31.69
ppm (Figure 2D), which is the β carbon
of proline, shows correlations with many 1H resonances
other than the reference proline resonances (black), making unambiguous
proline identification using 1H alone difficult. In contrast,
the slice from the same (31.69 ppm) trace in the 13C–13C STOCSY (Figure 2C) showed very strong
correlations with all other proline peaks and matched those from the
BMRB perfectly. Metabolites such as glutamine and glutamate could
only be distinguished using the improved resolution and chemical shift
differences in 13C and not with the highly overlapped 1H spectra. In the absence of 13C, many of these
metabolites would have been ambiguous using 1D 1H alone.
Prior to our study, methionine sulfoxide was not annotated in the
1D or 2D 1H spectra of the fly metabolome and was found
here by statistically correlating carbons through heteroatoms such
as sulfur using 13C–13C STOCSY. Metabolites
identified in Supporting Information Table S1 were consistent with previously collected and analyzed
data using conventional methods (Chenomx), 2D NMR, and spiking experiments
(Williams et al., unpublished results).

Figure 3 PLS-DA of 13C (A) and 1H (B) 1D spectra from
cold hardy and cold susceptible flies. PLS-DA produced better separation
of cold hardy (red) and susceptible flies (blue) in 13C
data with a Q2 value of 0.77 and an R2 value of 0.85 when compared to 1H data with a Q2 value of 0.24 and an R2 value of 0.34. Loadings plots of component
1 for both 13C and 1H are given in (A) and (B)
respectively. 13C component 1 loadings gave the compounds
contributing to the differences between the hardy and susceptible
flies. 1H component 1 loadings plot (B) showed little differences
between the groups, though sugars seemed to load better with the cold
susceptible flies. Red and positive peaks indicate resonances that
were correlated with cold hardy flies, and blue and negative resonances
indicate resonances that correlated well with the cold susceptible.
Annotations are given for 1D 13C and 1H loadings
plot (A and B, respectively).

PLS-DA performed on the fly 13C 1D spectra yielded
clear
separation of cold-hardy flies and cold-susceptible flies on component
1 (Figure 3A). The 1H spectra failed
to yield separation on either component 1 or 2. Here we show that
the 13C data provided much better separation between hardy
and susceptible flies (Q2 = 0.77 and R2 = 0.85) and had stronger loadings than those
from the 1H data in Figure 3B (Q2 = 0.24 and R2 =
0.34.). Annotated 13C and 1H loadings of component
1 are given in Figure 3. In addition, PCA performed
on the fly 13C 1D spectra gave better separation along
PC1 (Supporting Information Figure S3A),
while the 1H spectra gave some separation along PC2 (Supporting Information Figure S3B). The PC1 loadings for the 13C 1D spectra
and PC2 loadings for the 1H 1D spectra gave similar results
as the PLS-DA. histidine, AMP, phosphocholine, taurine, and methionine
sulfoxide all loaded with the hardy flies, and glucose (possibly also
other sugars), proline, alanine, and arginine loaded with the susceptible
flies. All of these compounds were identified and verified as altered
by selection in a parallel study using 1D and 2D 1H NMR,
and the direction of alteration was confirmed in 78% of cases (all
but AMP and taurine, which were higher in susceptible flies in the
parallel study: Williams et al., unpublished results). The differences
in the direction of the effect may be due to using only a subset of
lines in the present study, and the flies in the present study were
also not exposed to cold. These findings support the primary conclusions
that hardy flies have alterations to pathways involved in membrane
lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and energy balance. These alterations
are consistent with the hypothesis that cold-hardy flies maintain
aerobic metabolism in the cold, preventing the (potentially deleterious)
accumulation of alanine and sugars.

13C NMR Offers
Improved Confidence in Metabolite
Identification
The mdx mouse is an animal
model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)—a muscle degenerating
disease found in young males. The inability to produce dystrophin
results in a pathology in mice similar to that seen in humans.30 Tracking disease progression in children requires
difficult and painful muscle biopsies31 and effort-based functional testing.32 Importantly, current methods may be insensitive to therapeutic intervention.
Identifying biomarkers of disease progression for DMD using an easily
obtained sample such as serum or urine is essential for improving
our ability to treat and diagnose this debilitating disease.

Although the overall sensitivity with the small volume of mouse serum
prevents the detection of large numbers of metabolites, we were able
to obtain high-quality NMR data on the most concentrated compounds,
suggesting that 13C NMR metabolomics using isotopically
labeled compounds for flux studies on survival bleeds is also possible
with this probe. Similar to the fly study, the mouse serum revealed
that 13C produced more robust PLS-DA results than 1H data, separating along PC1 with a cross-validation (Q2) value of 0.67 and R2 of 0.79 compared to the 1H results of a Q2 value of 0.46 and R2 value of 0.66 (Supporting Information Figure S5). Thus, for at least the two biological data sets analyzed
in this paper, 13C NMR data improves group separation using
PLS-DA. Using the 13C workflow developed here, we have
found that the addition of 13C helps in making specific
identifications and, perhaps more important, in preventing the misidentification
of metabolites suggested by 1H NMR alone. For example, 1H resonances at 0.9, 1.3, and 2.75 ppm are often associated
with fatty acids, but the specific fatty acid species is typically
not annotated. Here, with the addition of the 13C–13C STOCSY and 13C–1H SHY correlation
maps, we were able to identify linoleic acid as the specific fatty
acid abundant in our 1H and 13C spectra (Supporting Information Figure S4).

Figure 4 Analysis of
specific resonances in mouse serum for metabolite identification
or error detection. The mdx data are in red and the
control in blue. All the spectra are overlaid in (A), with the average
data for each group shown as a bold line. Resonances at 3.02 ppm (unknown)
and 2.39 ppm (succinate) in the 1H (A) are expanded, and
the relative intensities are given in the box plot. Metabolites indicated
in (B) are overlaid onto the 1D spectra (A and B). Expansion of the
carbon 1D from ∼20 to 60 ppm shows the absence of creatine
peak at 38.9 ppm, but the presence of a peak at 36.5 ppm confirms
the possibility of succinate. Using just the 1H data, the
peak at 3.02 ppm would likely be assigned to creatine, which we can
rule out with the 13C data.

Figure 4 shows representative 1H and 13C 1D spectra from the mouse serum. Previous
NMR
studies in the muscle of mdx vs control mice have
reported a decrease in muscle creatine that varies with age and tissue,
thought to result from increased inflammation and degeneration of
the muscle.33,34 It is hypothesized that this
leads to an in increase in serum creatine of mdx mice
through dystrophin deficient “leaky” muscle membranes.34 In our data, the 1H PLS-DA results
indicated a resonance at 1.30 ppm that separates the control from mdx. Analysis of the 1H STOCSY using 1.30 ppm
as a driver peak indicated a correlating resonance or overlapping
resonances at 3.02 ppm, often assigned to creatine. However, other
creatine 1H resonances were overlapped, making it difficult
to analyze. To further investigate whether creatine is associated
with disease development in the mdx mouse model,
we examined the 13C–1H SHY data and found
correlations with the 3.02 ppm resonance to the 13C peaks
at 56.5 and 41.2 ppm; the correlation at 38.9 ppm we would expect
to see for creatine was not present (Figure 4). Creatine is often assumed to be the largest contributor to the
peak at 1H 3.02 ppm.35,36 To determine if the
absence of the creatine peak at 38.9 ppm in the 13C 1D
was due to sensitivity limitations, we compared the integrals of the 1H resonance at the 3.02 ppm (−CH3) to the
succinate at peak 2.39 ppm (CH2–CH2)
(Figure 4A). Given the relative abundance of
the creatine compared to the succinate resonance, we expect to see
a 13C peak at 38.9 ppm comparable to the succinate resonance
seen at 36.5 ppm in the 13C spectra. Therefore, using 13C data we conclude that creatine is not present at concentrations
that we can measure in this experiment. This was verified by a spiking
experiment with synthetic creatine, which did not correspond to resonances
observed from the mice (data not shown). Despite extensive precedent
in the literature assigning 1H resonances at 3.02 ppm in
metabolomics mixtures, the 13C data clearly shows that
creatine would have been an incorrect assignment in our case.

Citrulline (Figure 4B) has a resonance near
3.02 ppm and is another possible assignment of this peak. 13C–1H SHY and 13C–13C STOCSY data show correlations between the resonance at 3.02 ppm
in the 1H spectra and suspected citrulline resonances 56.5
and 41.2 ppm. We do not, however, observe strong correlations to other
citrulline 13C peaks. In addition, the 1H chemical
shifts do not agree well with citrulline (Figure 4A). Thus, by using both 1H and 13C spectra
of the same sample, we were able to rule out two previously associated
compounds as unlikely to be contributing to our NMR spectra. Further
analysis is needed to identify the compound(s) associated with these
peaks, but this result further demonstrates the utility of 13C NMR in metabolomics studies.

Future Improvements
There are several possible improvements
that could be made in the future. First, a larger volume NMR probe
with 13C optimization would provide greater absolute sensitivity.
This, however, would result in lower mass sensitivity because the
sensitivity of NMR probes is roughly inversely proportional to the
diameter of the coils.37 A 5 mm NMR tube
requires a volume that is approximately 600 μL compared with
40 μL for our 1.5 mm probe used here, a 15-fold difference.
A commercial 5 mm 13C optimized probe would provide about
7-fold greater absolute sensitivity with 15-fold more sample than
our small volume probe.9 Therefore, for
situations that are not sample-limited such as human urine or serum,
a commercial large volume 13C probe would provide up to
about 7× better sensitivity than we can achieve using our small
volume probe. However, for mass-limited samples such as mouse serum
or D. melanogaster extracts, our 40 μL probe
would provide about 2× better results than the same quantity
of sample diluted to 600 μL. Second, a T1 relaxation
agent could be added to the samples to further reduce the relaxation
time and also better recover slowly relaxing quaternary carbons that
we attenuated in this study. Finally, dissolution dynamic nuclear
polarization (DNP) is an emerging technique that can transiently enhance
the 13C signal of a sample by >10 000 fold for
about
1 or 2 min.6 If some or all of these techniques
could be used to improve sensitivity of the NMR measurement even more,
then the benefits of 13C metabolomics that we have demonstrated
could be fully realized.

Conclusion
We have shown that by
using a 13C-optimized NMR probe,9 we were able to acquire high-quality 13C NMR data in
a reasonable amount of time and with relatively small
sample volumes. The overall workflow allowed for more accurate identification
of compounds through database matching by utilizing both the standard
1D 13C and 1H NMR data. There is a cost of about
2 h per sample in terms of extra measurement time, but inspection
of the NMR spectra clearly shows the increased spectral dispersion
of the 13C compared to the 1H data from the
same sample (e.g., Figure 1A and B) that in
turn leads to many desirable results in database matching and ultimately
better separation of groups using multivariate analysis. Using the
synthetic mixture, we determined that the limit of analysis through
correlations was about 60 nmol, although this could be improved even
more with more sensitive NMR measurements.

When statistically
combined with 1H NMR data on the
same samples, the 13C spectra enable new approaches that
produce the following: (1) peak lists for better spectral annotation,
(2) improved group separation using multivariate statistical analysis
because of reduced spectral overlap, and (3) improved confidence in
identified metabolites and the ability to reject identifications based
on 1H data alone. We developed and validated our approach
using a synthetic mixture and then applied it to two different biological
examples: D. melanogaster cold tolerance models in
which metabolites that significantly changed between hardy and susceptible
lines of flies were easily identified and mass-limited mouse serum
where metabolite identification using 13C spectral analysis
could not be done with 1H analysis alone. In the case of
the mouse serum, the addition of 13C data not only enhanced
our ability to identify specific compounds but it also prevented mistakes
that could have been made with 1H data alone.
