Understanding the
mechanisms behind amyloid protein aggregation
in diseases, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease,
is often hampered by the reproducibility of in vitro assays. Yet,
understanding the basic mechanisms of protein misfolding is essential
for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. We show here,
that for the amyloid protein α-synuclein (aSyn), a protein involved
in Parkinson’s disease (PD), chromatographic buffers and storage
conditions can significantly interfere with the overall structure
of the protein and thus affect protein aggregation kinetics. We apply
several biophysical and biochemical methods, including size exclusion
chromatography (SEC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and atomic force
microscopy (AFM), to characterize the high molecular weight conformers
formed during protein purification and storage. We further apply hydrogen/deuterium-exchange
mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to characterize the monomeric form of aSyn
and reveal a thus far unknown structural component of aSyn at the
C-terminus of the protein. Furthermore, lyophilizing the protein greatly
affected the overall structure of this monomeric conformer. We conclude
from this study that structural polymorphism may occur under different
storage conditions, but knowing the structure of the majority of the
protein at the start of each experiment, as well as the factors that
may influence it, may pave the way to an improved understanding of
the mechanism leading to aSyn pathology in PD.

==== Body
The study
of protein misfolding
and amyloid fibril formation is important in the field of neurodegeneration,
including Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s,
and prion diseases, as well as other misfolding diseases, such as
antibody light chain amyloidosis and diabetes, where incorrectly folded
proteins also form insoluble β-sheets.1−3 Understanding
amyloid fibril formation is similarly important in the field of nanomedicine,
for instance, in the synthesis of structural tissue scaffolds, whereby
artificial self-assembling amyloids can be utilized for their tensile
strength and ease of functionalization.4 Unfortunately, tracking the transformation of initially soluble
monomeric species into insoluble amyloid fibrils is difficult because
experimental conditions and sample heterogeneity greatly affect the
reproducibility of aggregation assays. Several fluorescence-based
methods are in use to track the formation of amyloid fibrils, such
as thioflavin T (ThT), Congo Red, and N-arylaminonaphthalenesulfonate
(ANS)-based assays5 and, more recently,
the intrinsic fluorescence-based assay.6,7 Much work has
been undertaken to increase the reproducibility of experiments investigating
amyloid fibril formation kinetics. The addition of salts, metals,
alteration of pH or temperature greatly affects the aggregation rate
of amyloid proteins and the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)
or glass beads has been shown to reduce-well-to-well variability of
aggregation kinetic curves from ThT-based assays.8−10 It is thus
of foremost importance to have a clear understanding of the impact
of purification protocols, including the choice of buffers, protein
purity, and protein storage format.

We have studied the amyloid
protein, α-synuclein (aSyn),
which is involved in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Monomeric aSyn
is an intrinsically disordered (IDP) soluble protein formed of an
N-terminus lipid binding domain (aa 1–60), a hydrophobic, so-called
nonamyloid-component (NAC) region (aa 61–95), which increases
the aggregation propensity of the protein, and a negatively charged
C-terminus domain that modulates aggregation (aa 96–140).11 Like many other amyloid proteins, so far, the
mechanistic pathway from soluble unstructured aSyn to insoluble fibrils
has not been fully elucidated. To achieve this goal, one requires
reliable and reproducible aggregation assays and accordingly an understanding
of the conformational states of the protein at the start of the assay.
However, at present, there are many protocols discussed in the literature
(see Table 1) on how
to purify and store recombinant aSyn. The effect of protein storage
on protein aggregation kinetics has so far not been investigated.
In the current study, we used the protocol described by Huang et al.
and Campioni et al., applying periplasmic lysis, ion exchange chromatography
(IEX), and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC), to purify
recombinant aSyn.12,13 Importantly, this protocol does
not include a heating step, which may lead to partial protein degradation
that may affect assay variability.14

After purification, we dialyzed the
protein into different buffers
and then either lyophilized or froze it for storage. Lyophilization
is commonly used in protein research20 since
it provides for facile storage of the protein, easy reconstitution
in any desired buffer solution, and does not require any time-consuming
buffer exchanges. Lyophilization involves three steps: (i) freezing,
(ii) primary dehydration to remove ice (sublimation), and (iii) secondary
dehydration to remove traces of water (desorption).21 However, each step of the process may introduce protein
damage by degradation or structural alteration or protein aggregation.22−27 Moreover, the structural recovery of proteins after lyophilization
is dependent on the protein and the buffer composition, while many
proteins will refold upon reconstitution in aqueous solution, some
will remain misfolded or aggregated.28

Here, we investigate the impact of buffer solutions and protein
storage conditions on the aggregation kinetics of recombinant human
wild type (WT) aSyn by lyophilizing or freezing the protein in H2O or 20 mM sodium phosphate (NaP) buffer, pH 7.2. We show
that the aggregation kinetics of aSyn are affected by lyophilization
as demonstrated in a ThT-based aggregation assay. On the one hand,
lyophilization of aSyn accelerates amyloid nucleation reactions, while
on the other hand the elongation reaction is slowed down compared
to freezing. Moreover, the plate-to-plate variance in the amount of
amyloid aggregates formed is increased in the lyophilized aSyn samples
when compared to the frozen samples. Although the samples were primarily
monomeric, the presence of a small percentage of high molecular weight
(HMW) conformers was confirmed by analytical size exclusion chromatography
(SEC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and atomic force microscopy
(AFM), all of which displayed a variety of sizes and shapes of aSyn
HMW conformers formed under both lyophilizing and freezing processes.
We call these “HMW conformers” because currently we
cannot conclude whether these are similar to what is referred to as
“oligomers” in the literature. Finally, we used hydrogen–deuterium
exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to probe the molecular conformation
of the primarily monomeric aSyn to determine whether storage conditions
affected the sub molecular structure of aSyn. Interestingly, we show
that in both lyophilized and frozen aSyn samples the NAC region of
aSyn was the least solvent-protected region, while residues 115–125
and 134–140 of the C-terminus were the most protected. We also
observed that lyophilizing affects the structure of the monomeric
protein, as the aSyn sample was overall less accessible to the solvent
throughout the protein sequence compared to the frozen sample. We
highlight the importance of a full characterization of the amyloid
protein sample prior to analyzing its structure–function relationship.

Methods
and Materials
Escherichia coli Expression
of aSyn and Periplasmic
Lysis
The plasmid pT7–7 containing human aSyn cDNA
was transformed into Escherichia coli One Shot BL21
Star (DE3) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Two liter cultures of E. coli in Lysogeny Broth (LB) containing carbenicillin
(100 μg/mL) were grown at 37 °C and induced for expression
of aSyn with 1 mM isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG).
The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 7000g. To release the expressed aSyn, lysis of the periplasm was performed
following the protocol described in ref (12) The final supernatant containing aSyn and periplasmic
proteins was collected and dialyzed overnight in ion exchange (IEX)
buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8) in SnakeSkin dialysis tubing, MWCO
10 kDa (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).

aSyn Purification Using
IEX and HIC
For purification
of aSyn, we followed the protocol described in ref (13). The protein was loaded
onto a HiPrep Q FF 16/10 anion exchange column (GE Healthcare, Sweden)
and eluted against a linear gradient of IEX buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl,
0.5 M NaCl, pH 8). Fractions containing aSyn were pooled and dialyzed
overnight using hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) buffer
A (1 M (NH4)2SO4, 50 mM Bis-Tris,
pH 7) in Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes (10 kDa MWCO; Thermo Fischer
Scientific, USA). The dialyzed protein was loaded onto a HiPrep Phenyl
FF 16/10 (High Sub) hydrophobic interaction column (GE Healthcare,
Sweden) and eluted using HIC buffer B (50 mM Bis-Tris, pH 7). IEX
and HIC were performed on an ÄKTA Pure (GE Healthcare, Sweden).
Pooled IEX and HIC fractions were analyzed on a 4–12% Bis-Tris
gel by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue. Quantitative analysis
of protein purity was performed in FIJI image analysis software29 by profiling protein band intensity of the stained
gel. aSyn was purified twice for these experiments and reversed phase–high
pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) determined aSyn to be 85.22%
pure in purification batch 1 and 90.71% pure in purification batch
2. Amino acid analysis confirmed the composition of the purified WT
human aSyn (Table S1).

aSyn Storage
Using Either Lyophilization or Freezing at −80
°C
The fractions containing aSyn eluted from the HIC
column were pooled together and dialyzed extensively using either
H2O or 20 mM Na2HPO4 pH 7.2 (NaP)
in Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes (10 kDa MWCO). The dialyzates
were split into 1 mL aliquots. One aliquot of aSyn in NaP buffer was
directly placed at −80 °C, and one aliquot of either aSyn
in NaP buffer or H2O was frozen in liquid nitrogen, lyophilized
in a LyoQuest 85 freeze-dryer (Telstar, Spain), and stored at −80
°C.

Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)
SEC
analysis was performed on an Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC system (Agilent
Technologies LDA UK Limited, UK) equipped with an autosampler and
a diode-array detector using a BioSep-SEC-2000s column (Phenomenex,
UK) in phosphate-buffered saline (Gibco PBS, Thermo Fischer Scientific
UK LTD, UK) at 1 mL/min flow-rate. The elution profile was monitored
by UV absorption at 220 and 280 nm. For the SEC-HPLC analysis, the
directly frozen aSyn samples were thawed at room temperature, samples
lyophilized in H2O were resuspended in 20 mM NaP pH 7.2,
and aSyn lyophilized in 20 mM NaP pH 7.2, was resuspended in H2O. All aSyn samples were diluted to 100 μM and filtered
through a 0.22 μm filter (Millipore (U.K.) Limited, UK). The
SEC injection volume was 50 μL, six injections were made for
both frozen and lyophilized samples from purification batches 1 and
2. To estimate the molecular weight of aSyn species by their column
retention times, a standard protein mixture (PN 69385, Sigma-Aldrich)
was used to calibrate the BioSep-SEC-2000s column.

Dynamic Light
Scattering (DLS)
Samples were analyzed
on a Zetasizer Nano S (Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK). The DLS instrument
was equipped with a Peltier temperature controller set at +25 °C
temperature. Disposable microcuvettes (Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK)
were used for size measurements which were conducted at a scattering
angle of 173°. Every sample was measured at least seven times
with two or three repeats for samples from purification batches 1
and 2.

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)
Ten microliters of 100
μM solutions of frozen or lyophilized aSyn were incubated on
a freshly cleaved mica surface for 30 min. The mica was washed three
times in deionized H2O to remove lose protein and dried
under a stream of nitrogen. Images covering a field of view of 1 μm
× 1 μm were acquired in “Peak Force Quantitative
Nanomechanical Property mode” using ScanAsyst Air probes (BioScope
Resolve, Bruker AXS GmbH). Images were acquired at a scan rate of
1 Hz using a peak force ≤1.5 nN. The peak force amplitude was
set to 70 nm. Images were flattened using the NanoScope Analysis software,
version 1.8, before being exported for further analysis. Images were
analyzed using the ICY imaging software (http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/) and were gray rendered before analysis. The area of oligomers was
then calculated using the “Connected Components” plugin.
The gray scale 8-bit images were given a threshold of 50/256 to remove
background and the minimum size detection was 1 pixel to allow detection
of very small conformers with height profiles, 1 pixel = 1.95 nm.
A group of connected pixels was detected as a cluster (one aggregate).
Its area was attributed to the area of the respective HMW conformer.

Hydrogen/Deuterium-Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS)
Hydrogen–deuterium
exchange was performed using an HDX Manager
(Waters, US) equipped with a CTC PAL sample handling robot (LEAP Technologies,
US). Samples of WT aSyn in protonated aqueous buffer (20 mM NaP, pH
4.00) were diluted 20-fold into deuterated buffer (20 mM NaP, pD 4.00)
at 20 °C, and thus hydrogen/deuterium-exchange was initiated.
The buffer pH was adjusted to pH 4.00 using 1 M HCl and monitored
with a pH meter. The protein was incubated for various time points,
ranging from 30 s to 50 min. Hydrogen exchange was arrested by mixing
the protein solution 1:1 with a prechilled quench buffer (20 mM NaP,
8 M Urea, pH 2.45 at 20 °C). The protein was then digested into
peptides on an Enzymate immobilized pepsin column (Waters, US) and
the peptides were trapped and then separated on C18 columns (VanGuard
2.1 × 5 mm ACQUITY BEH and 1 × 100 mm ACQUITY BEH 1.7 μm,
respectively, Waters, US) with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (3–40%)
supplemented with 0.1% formic acid. Peptides were analyzed with a
Synapt G2-si mass spectrometer (Waters, US). Peptide mapping of aSyn,
where peptides were identified by MS fragmentation, was performed
prior to the hydrogen exchange experiments and analyzed using ProteinLynx
Global Server- PLGS (Waters, US). Peptide mapping of aSyn yielded
coverage of 100% of aSyn with a high degree of redundancy (Figure S6). Peptides were identified by MSE fragmentation with ProteinLynx Global Server (Waters, US).
Deuterium incorporation was measured in DynamX 3.0 (Waters, US) and
the data pertaining to deuterium uptake were analyzed and visualized
in MatLab (Mathworks, UK) and Excel (Microsoft, US). No correction
was made for back-exchange. The mean deuteration level per amino acid
(represented on Figure S8) was calculated
according to  1  where M̅j is the mean deuteration level at amino
acid residue j, n is the number
of overlapping peptides, q is the number of exchangeable
amides for peptide i, mit is the isotopic
weighted midpoint at labeling time t, and mi0 is the midpoint at time 0 (no deuteration).

Thioflavin-T (ThT) Binding Assay in 96-Well Plates
Ten micromolar
ThT was added to 150 μL of 100 μM aSyn
in 20 mM Na2HPO4 pH 7.2 from lyophilized and
frozen aSyn samples. All samples were filtered through 0.22 μm
filters before loading onto nonbinding, clear bottom, black 96-well
plates (PN 655906 Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Germany). The plates were
sealed with an Ampliseal transparent microplate sealer (Grenier Bio-One
GmbH, Germany). Fluorescence measurements were taken with an Envision
2104 Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer, Finland). The temperature was
set to 37 °C at the bottom and 39 °C at the top of the plate
to prevent condensation. The plates were incubated with orbital shaking
at 300 rpm between the readings. The readings of ThT fluorescence
intensity at 486 nm were collected every 16 min in the top excitation/emission
mode and at a focal height of 5.5 mm. Excitation was at 440 nm with
2 flashes using 10% of the excitation light. ThT assays were repeated
3 times (2× using purification batch 1 and 1× using purification
batch 2) using six wells for each condition. Data were normalized
to the well with the maximum fluorescence intensity for each plate.
The kinetic curves of the averaged raw data from the ThT fluorescence
were fitted to a sigmoidal curve and the nucleation rate k1 and the elongation rate k2 were calculated from the Finke–Watzky two-step model (eq 2).8,30 [A]0 refers to the ThT fluorescence (a.u.) at
time 0, and [B]t refers to the ThT fluorescence
(a.u.) of the fibrils formed at time t 2  

Results
Lyophilization
Influences aSyn Aggregation Kinetics
The kinetics of aSyn
aggregation are affected by many environmental
factors, including buffer composition, temperature, pH, the presence
of an air–water interface, hydrophobic surfaces or metals,
as well as the presence of preformed oligomers.13,31−35 We first examined whether lyophilizing or freezing aSyn had an influence
on the variability of aggregation kinetics measured by ThT since ThT-based
assays are frequently used to monitor amyloid fibril formation.8,36−38

We optimized the purification process of human
WT aSyn, starting with the protocol by Huang et al., using periplasmic
lysis and IEX.12 aSyn was 78.3% pure after
IEX as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) (Figure S1A). We next applied
HIC, following the protocol by Campioni et al., which improved protein
purity to 94%, as assessed by SDS-PAGE (Figure S1A).13 We further used analytical
RP-HPLC, which is more sensitive than SDS-PAGE, to determine the purity
of aSyn. After two chromatographic steps (IEX and HIC), aSyn reached
a purity of 85.2% in the purification batch 1 and 90.7% in the purification
batch 2, as quantified by peak integration from RP-HPLC traces (Figure S1B). The identity of human WT aSyn was
confirmed by amino acid analysis (Table S1). We dialyzed the protein in either a commonly used fibrillization
buffer, 20 mM NaP pH 7.2, or in H2O. After this, we either
lyophilized or froze the protein at −80 °C until further
use.

Before ThT-based aggregation experiments were performed,
the aSyn
lyophilized in NaP buffer was resuspended in H2O and both
lyophilized and frozen samples were filtered through a 0.22 μm
membrane. The fluorescence data from the ThT-based assay exhibited
sigmoidal behavior from which kinetic information could be extracted
and individual well traces are shown in Figure 1A. We observed that lyophilization of aSyn
increased the mean of the standard error of the mean (SEM) between
ThT experiments compared to freezing (Figure 1B). To determine the remaining monomer concentration
of aSyn after the ThT-based aggregation assay we used analytical SEC
and showed that there was less remaining monomeric aSyn in the lyophilized
samples but a greater variability in well to well concentrations compared
to frozen samples (Table S2). Rate constants
for a 2-step (nucleation and elongation) aggregation mechanism were
calculated using the Finke–Watzky equation30 from sigmoidal curves of the mean ThT fluorescence data
(Figure S2). The nucleation rate, A →
B (rate constant k1) and the elongation
rate A + B → 2B, (rate constant k2) could be calculated from fitted ThT fluorescence curves (Figure S3), least-squares curve fitting was performed
in MATLAB using curve fitting toolbox, goodness of fitted data is
presented in Table S3. The k1 nucleation rate was faster in the lyophilized aSyn sample,
1.22 ± 0.1 s–1 nucleation events/s, compared
to the frozen sample, 0.80 ± 0.04 s–1 nucleation
events/s (Table 2).
Conversely, the k2 elongation rate was
slower for the lyophilized aSyn sample, 0.86 ± 0.01 ms–1, compared to the frozen sample, 1.62 ± 0.03 ms–1.

difference between the mean of SEMs of frozen and lyophilized samples
is p < 0.0001 using an unpaired t test (Welch’s). 100 μM aSyn was incubated in a 96 well
plate with continuous orbital agitation at 300 rpm for 120 h.

Analytical Size Exclusion
Chromatography of aSyn Identifies
Mostly Monomeric Protein but High Molecular Weight Conformers Are
Also Present in All Storage Conditions
To investigate the
origin of the differences in variability and nucleation/elongation
rates of lyophilized and frozen aSyn samples, we used a variety of
structure sensitive methods, including analytical SEC, DLS, AFM, and
HDX-MS, to deduce whether the choice of buffer and storage conditions
had an effect on the protein conformation. Our analytical SEC results
show that the majority of aSyn is in its monomeric form (Figure 2A), independent of
the storage protocols used. Monomeric aSyn eluted at 6.78 min minutes
from the calibrated BioSep-SEC-2000s column, from which a MW of 78.5
± 2.7 kDa was estimated (Figure 2A). The predicted MW of aSyn using SEC has been previously
shown to range between 60 and 70 kDa.9,16,39 Monomeric aSyn in aqueous solution has an extended
conformation, reflected in a larger hydrodynamic radius. The models
used to calculate molecular weight from SEC data assume a globular
fold and overestimate the mass of aSyn which is 14.4 kDa. The first
elution peak, shown in the zoomed in Figure 2B, corresponds to high molecular weight (HMW)
conformers of 480 ± 17 kDa (Figure 2B). Aggregates of similar size (∼440
kDa; SDS-PAGE) have also been observed by others when aSyn was purified
using precipitation by streptomycin sulfate and ammonium sulfate with
subsequent lyophilization.40 aSyn samples
that were lyophilized in H2O and reconstituted in NaP buffer
had the highest content of HMW conformers, that is, 2.45 ± 0.05%.
The aSyn samples lyophilized in NaP buffer had a lower percentage
of HMW conformers of 0.12 ± 0.01%, but the lowest percentage
of HMW conformers, 0.01 ± 0.01%, were found in the aSyn sample
in NaP buffer which was directly frozen at −80 °C (Table 3).

Figure 2 Analytical SEC reveals
a higher degree of HMW conformers in the
lyophilized aSyn samples. (A) Elution profile of aSyn after freezing
in NaP (blue), lyophilizing in NaP (red), lyophilizing in H2O (black), all samples were filtered through a 0.22 μm filter.
50 μL of 100 μM aSyn was analyzed on a BioSep-SEC s2000
column equilibrated in PBS at 1 mL/min. Monomeric aSyn eluted from
the column at ∼7 min corresponding to MW 78.5 ± 2.7 kDa.
HMW conformers eluted earlier ∼5.5 min, corresponding to MW
480 ± 17 kDa. Dashed box outlines the zoomed in area shown in
B. (B) Zoomed area shows more HMW conformers in the lyophilized samples
compared to frozen, the most HMW conformers were detected in the lyophilized
in H2O sample.

DLS Identifies a Wider Size Distribution of aSyn Monomeric Conformers
after Lyophilizing than after Freezing
DLS was used to further
characterize the size range of various conformers present in the NaP
and H2O buffer samples. DLS can estimate the size distribution
of particles in the nanometer–micrometer range based on their
light scattering profiles. Previous reports show that monomeric aSyn
has a diameter ranging between 4–8 nm using DLS.41 Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis
also determined monomeric aSyn had a radius of 4.0 ± 0.1 nm,
corresponding to a diameter of ∼8 nm. A folded globular protein
of the same length would have a diameter ∼3, indicating that
the monomeric aSyn is unfolded.33 Analyzing
the DLS measured size distribution by volume, that is, analyzing primarily
monomeric protein, we show that aSyn lyophilized in NaP buffer contained
monomer which had a size distribution between 3–20 nm, compared
to 3–11 nm for aSyn frozen in NaP buffer (Figure 3). The size distributions may
be attributed to by variations of monomer conformation and/or presence
of some dimer/trimers. Analysis of the DLS data by intensity, focusing
more on the HMW species, reveals HMW conformers of ∼200 nm
in both lyophilized and frozen samples but also showing greater variance
in the lyophilized aSyn by size distribution (Figure S4 and Table S4). Samples
of aSyn lyophilized and frozen in NaP buffer were probed by AFM to
examine the shape of the HMW conformers (Figure S5A and B). The conformers in both samples were heterogeneous
in size and shape which has been also observed in other studies.42 However, the conformers induced by lyophilizing
had a bigger surface area (Figure S5C)
and showed greater heterogeneity in shape, while frozen aSyn HMW conformers
were more ellipsoid in shape (Figure S5A and B).

Figure 3 DLS reveals the presence of primarily monomeric protein in both
frozen and lyophilized aSyn with the lyophilized sample displaying
a wider size distribution. % Volume (log2) of the 100 μM aSyn
sample is plotted against the diameter of aSyn detected (d.nm). aSyn
frozen in NaP buffer (blue) and aSyn lyophilized in H2O
and reconstituted in NaP buffer (red) contain primarily monomeric
protein (4–8 d.nm). Next to monomeric protein there are also
different aSyn conformers present, with the lyophilized sample displaying
a greater size heterogeneity compared to the frozen sample. Experiments
were repeated twice with a total of 35 readings for lyophilized samples
and 21 for frozen samples.

HDX-MS Confirms the Presence of Different Monomeric Conformers
in the Lyophilized versus Frozen aSyn Samples
The above analytical
SEC and DLS results have identified that the majority of the aSyn
protein was in its monomeric form, but there may be different monomeric
conformations present after freezing and lyophilization. To probe
the submolecular conformation of aSyn in its monomeric form and to
measure the impact of freezing and lyophilization on the monomer,
we applied HDX-MS. The observed rates of H/D-exchange indicate the
degree of solvent exposure and/or stable hydrogen-bonding. Prior to
HDX-MS, the sample lyophilized in NaP buffer was freshly dissolved
into H2O and both the frozen and lyophilized samples were
diluted to a stock concentration of 80 μM. HDX-MS was done as
a “bottom-up” experiment: therefore, the protein sequence
was initially mapped to the experimental data (essentially a spectral
assignment process) in order to confidently monitor H/D-exchange at
the submolecular level. The assigned peptides from the mass spectra
are the basis for submolecular resolution, which is summarized in
a coverage map (Figure S6). The protein
was then labeled with deuterium by incubation at pH 4.00 for various
time intervals, ranging from 30 s to 50 min (3000 s). The labeling
experiment was performed at pH 4.00, as the kinetics of H/D exchange
were too fast to observe any difference at pH 7.2 (Figure S7). This is a reflection of the very low hydrogen-exchange
protection factors in an intrinsically disordered protein, such as
aSyn. The HDX-MS data are obtained from a time course study of deuterium
uptake at each measured location within the protein chain. The data
are expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible deuterium uptake
at each site—this is termed the relative fractional uptake.
Analysis of the relative fractional uptake of deuterium in both the
lyophilized and frozen samples showed that the NAC region had the
most deuterium uptake both in terms of exchange rate and the observed
extent of labeling after 50 min (Figure 4). Two regions were observed in the N-terminal
domain that showed a high degree of protection to H/D-exchange (residues
5–26 and 40–55); both with even more pronounced protection
following lyophilization. The greatest degree of protection against
deuterium-labeling was observed in two regions in the C-terminal domain
(residues 115–125 and 135–140). The protection from
deuterium uptake observed at the C-terminus under both conditions
suggests there is a C-terminal fold in the monomeric protein. This
has not been reported previously using HDX-MS, although other biophysical
studies have observed an overall compaction of aSyn at lower pH.33,43,44 When comparing relative differences
in deuterium uptake between lyophilized and frozen samples, the lyophilized
sample was found to exchange at a slower rate than the frozen sample
throughout the protein sequence. This is most evident in the reduced
relative fractional uptake at early time points (Figure 4) and results in a positive
value for the difference of mean deuteration (Figure S8). This indicates increased solvent protection, or
the emergence of secondary structure. We interpret this as a compacting
of the lyophilized sample through increased hydrogen bonding either
internally or externally to other monomers. Importantly, although
it has previously been shown that lyophilization may induce aggregation
(shown here by DLS and AFM), HDX-MS data indicate that lyophilization
also affects the structure of monomeric protein.

Figure 4 Relative fractional deuterium
uptake for frozen and lyophilized
aSyn samples. Lyophilized aSyn is more solvent protected than frozen
aSyn but both samples contain a solvent protected region at the C-terminus.
Shown is the relative fractional mass increase over the time course
of the experiment, samples were taken at 0.5, 0.75, 1, 5, and 50 min.
Data is scaled between the minimum and maximum values observed. Large
values of relative uptake (blue) indicate solvent accessibility or
lack of stable hydrogen bonding, while small values (red) indicate
solvent protection and/or stable hydrogen bonding.

Discussion
There has been an extensive
research effort in the field of amyloid
protein aggregation to determine the kinetics of fibril formation
and to understand how toxic forms of amyloid proteins in disease arise.
Although we are slowly unpicking the biophysical mechanisms behind
monomer to fibril formation, there are still a great number of variables,
such as the effect of buffer solution and protein storage protocols
that need to be taken into consideration and which may hamper our
goal to reliably measure amyloid protein aggregation kinetics. In
this study, we deduce that for aSyn, freezing is preferential to lyophilization
which not only introduces more HMW conformers but also has an effect
on the monomeric protein as shown by HDX-MS. Note, we use the term
“conformers” to describe aSyn species because (a) we
cannot conclude that the aSyn species we observe are similar to “oligomers”
referred to in the literature, particularly HMW conformers formed
during lyophilization as these seem to have different morphology as
determined by AFM to those formed by incubation of high concentrations
of aSyn45 and (b) we already observe a
structural conformer in monomeric aSyn which may directly influence
aggregation kinetics. Because of the very low concentrations of HMW
conformers in our samples, we were unable to isolate them for further
structural analysis or to identify whether they became incorporated
into fibrils or if they even could inhibit elongation.

Many
protocols rely on lyophilization as a method for protein storage.
We show, as part of the study, that lyophilizing aSyn greatly affects
the variability in a ThT-based aggregation assay. In particular, lyophilization
causes an increase in the percentage of HMW conformers, increases
the heterogeneity of conformers, and most importantly affects the
monomer structure by altering the hydrogen bonding, possibly by compaction
or by inducing intermolecular bonding. As discussed, we observed differences
in nucleation and elongation rates for frozen and lyophilized aSyn
samples, however, it is difficult to speculate why the mechanism of
fibrillization may be different since we do not have single fibril
resolution. Using a single fibril-based aggregation assay, we and
others have previously shown that there is structural polymorphism
in aSyn fibrils formed in vitro as certain aSyn fibrils had failed
to elongate in a seeding assay, while others had monodirectional and
bidirectional growth.46−48 Whether or not this polymorphism stems from the presence
of different monomeric aSyn conformers present at the start of the
experiment or from the presence of certain HMW conformers remains
to be determined.

Despite lyophilization increasing the number
of HMW conformers
in the samples compared to freezing, the total amount of HMW species
formed in all samples was relatively low, ranging from 2.45% in H2O to 0.12–0.01% in NaP buffer. However, lyophilizing
the protein in H2O rather than in NaP buffer does increase
the percentage of HMW conformers present. DLS revealed that there
is an increase in the heterogeneity of the size distribution of conformers
formed during lyophilization compared to freezing. In particular,
using AFM, we could show that the HMW conformers formed during lyophilizing
were heterogeneous in shape, while those formed during freezing displayed
a more homogeneous ellipsoid shape. This ellipsoid shape has been
reported by others using oligomers formed during incubation of highly
concentrated aSyn and may suggest that lyophilization is introducing
nonphysiological HMW conformers.9,45,49,50

To gain more insight into
the structural differences of the primarily
monomeric protein, we applied HDX-MS which provides molecular-scale
resolution. We observed the highest solvent protection at the C-terminus
of aSyn in both, the lyophilized and the frozen aSyn sample. We also
observed that the NAC region was the least protected region of the
protein. Previously published HDX-MS data on aSyn probed oligomeric
aSyn, which had already been aggregated, showing NAC protection and
C-terminus exposure.51,52 We, however, expect our results
to stem from monomeric protein due to the very low percentage of HMW
conformers present in our samples, 0.12% in lyophilized and 0.01%
in frozen samples.

So far HDX-MS had not been used to study
the structure of monomeric
aSyn. There have though been studies using NMR suggesting that there
are certain intramolecular interactions present in the monomeric form
of aSyn. Nuclear magnetic resonance with paramagnetic relaxation enhancement
(NMR PRE) studies have proposed that the NAC region of aSyn may be
protected from intermolecular interactions and aggregation in the
monomeric form of aSyn, as the charged C-terminus can fold over and
interact with the hydrophobic NAC region.53−55 However, there
are other studies which have identified N-terminus residues 12–2653 and residues 3–15 and 35–5056 directly interacting with the C- terminus of
aSyn. Again, others propose it is both a combination of hydrophobic
C-terminus and NAC, and N- and C-terminus charge interactions that
determine the structure of the monomer.57,58 Our HDX-MS
data suggest that the C-terminus may interact with the N-terminus
since we see a higher degree of HDX-MS protection at residues 5–26
and 40–55, rather than within the NAC region where we observe
less protection. The most striking observation has been that the highest
level of protection occurs at the C-terminus. Bertoncini et al., had
previously identified two hydrophobic regions of aSyn at residues
115–119 and 125–129 within the C-terminus using NMR.53 This combined with our HDX-MS results, where
we observe significant hydrogen-exchange protection for residues 115–125
and 135–140, suggests that there is a fold at the C-terminus.

We propose HDX-MS as a useful method to analyze monomeric IDPs,
particularly as the field advances into fast mixing allowing millisecond
sampling to capture folding events and study misfolding pathways.
Currently, many studies utilize NMR PRE to study intramolecular interactions
of IDPs. This method requires labeled isotopes and a high concentration
of protein. HDX-MS on the other hand only uses low protein concentrations
and, in comparison, is higher through-put.

Whether the aSyn
conformations identified in the present study
are involved in elongation or toxicity is a very pertinent question
in the field, particularly in light of the growing evidence of the
presence of different subpopulations of oligomers and polymorphs of
aSyn fibrils, the formation of which being strongly dependent on their
surrounding environment,59−61 but also in light of the debate
within the field of residual structure in the “disordered”
monomer.53,60,62 We show in
this work that it is important to fully characterize the amyloid protein
of interest within the experimental setup, i.e. considering buffer
and storage conditions before studying amyloid aggregation kinetics.
Only if we know what the starting conditions are will we be able to
improve sample to sample variability in the future and further unpick
the biophysical mechanisms of folding, ultimately advancing the future
of therapeutic strategies.
