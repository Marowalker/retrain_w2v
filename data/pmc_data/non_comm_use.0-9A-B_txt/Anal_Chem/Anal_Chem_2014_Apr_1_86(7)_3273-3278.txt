Nucleic
acid aptamers function as versatile sensing and targeting
agents for analytical, diagnostic, therapeutic, and gene-regulatory
applications, but their limited characterization and functional validation
have hindered their broader implementation. We report the development
of a surface plasmon resonance-based platform for rapid characterization
of kinetic and equilibrium binding properties of aptamers to small
molecules. Our system is label-free and scalable and enables analysis
of different aptamer–target pairs and binding conditions with
the same platform. This method demonstrates improved sensitivity,
flexibility, and stability compared to other aptamer characterization
methods. We validated our assay against previously reported aptamer
affinity and kinetic measurements and further characterized a diverse
panel of 12 small molecule-binding RNA and DNA aptamers. We report
the first kinetic characterization for six of these aptamers and affinity
characterization of two others. This work is the first example of
direct comparison of in vitro selected and natural aptamers using
consistent characterization conditions, thus providing insight into
the influence of environmental conditions on aptamer binding kinetics
and affinities, indicating different possible regulatory strategies
used by natural aptamers, and identifying potential in vitro selection
strategies to improve resulting binding affinities.

==== Body
Aptamers have emerged as a versatile
sensing tool due to their ability to bind molecular targets with high
specificity and affinity and potential to be generated de novo through
in vitro selection processes1,2 or harvested from natural
biological systems.3 The functional diversity
of aptamers enables their use for diagnostic and analytical detection;4 as therapeutics,5 drug
targets,6 and drug delivery vehicles;7 as noncovalent chemical protecting groups;8 for intracellular imaging9 and scaffolding;10 for enzyme11 and strain12 engineering;
and for gene regulation.13,3 Despite the large number
of reported aptamers, the majority are still poorly characterized,
limiting their increasingly widespread use to a small subset of targets.14 Determination of key properties, including affinity,
kinetics, specificity, ion dependence, and buffer sensitivity, is
critical for understanding aptamer molecular recognition and implementing
aptamers in diverse applications. A thorough characterization of aptamers
would further support the study of natural regulatory systems and
facilitate the engineering of customized aptamer-based sensors, diagnostics,
and therapeutics. Furthermore, variation in characterization methods,
binding conditions, and reported binding parameters has so far prevented
direct comparison of binding properties across aptamers.

Characterizing
small molecule-binding aptamers is particularly
challenging as high sensitivity is required to detect binding of low
molecular weight targets. Current methods, including isocratic elution,15−18 equilibrium filtration,15,19,20 and in-line probing,21−26 typically rely on intrinsic fluorescence properties of the target27−30 or labeling that risks altering the binding interaction or limits
method scalability and are often restricted to specific reaction conditions25,26 or exhibit limited sensitivity.26 Likewise,
methods for determining binding kinetics, such as stopped-flow fluorescence
spectroscopy,27,31,32 single-molecule fluorescence imaging,33 and gel-shift assays,34 also require
labeling,31−34 detailed structural knowledge,31,32 or intrinsic
fluorescence properties.27 These methods
are therefore not compatible with many small molecule targets and
do not support high-throughput aptamer characterization.

Isothermal
titration calorimetry (ITC) is a label-free method that
measures the heat released from aptamer–target complex formation
to determine affinity, stoichiometry, and thermodynamic parameters.35 Kinetic ITC (kinITC) is a recently developed
variant that jointly determines thermodynamic and kinetic parameters.36 These techniques mitigate some of the challenges
associated with conventional label-based methods, but sensitivity
remains a key limitation and accurate characterization of high affinity
aptamers remains difficult.37,38

A surface plasmon
resonance (SPR)-based assay offers potential
solutions to many challenges associated with aptamer characterization.
SPR is an optical detection platform that allows real-time and label-free
characterization of kinetic and steady-state affinity properties of
biomolecular interactions. Typically, one interacting partner is immobilized
to the sensor surface, and its interaction with other molecules in
solution is monitored. The observed change in refractive index correlates
to mass concentration near the surface and is recorded as resonance
units (RU).

While SPR has been used to measure aptamer–protein
interactions,39 measuring small molecule–aptamer
interactions
remains challenging due to the small local mass density change contributed
by the small molecule.40 To increase the
measurable response, small molecules can be immobilized to the surface
so that binding of the larger aptamer can be observed.41 However, chemical modification of the target
can impact binding and requires suitable functional groups for conjugation.
A few cases of nucleic acids binding to small molecules in solution
have been demonstrated by capturing aptamer onto a streptavidin sensor
surface directly36 or via hybridization.42 The low density of aptamer capable of being
immobilized to the streptavidin surface43 prevents accurate measurement of low molecular weight targets,44 and denaturing regeneration conditions lead
to a systematic decrease in binding capacity42 and reduce the lifetime of the protein-based surface.43 Previous reports have demonstrated small molecule
binding to protein using a high density sensor surface40 and suggest that aptamer immobilization at higher
densities may support a more sensitive and stable method for measuring
small molecule–aptamer binding.

Here we report an improved
platform for characterizing binding
properties of aptamers to small molecules. We quantitatively measured
method performance across a range of metrics, validated and tested
the method with 12 in vitro selected and natural aptamers, and determined
previously unreported aptamer kinetic and affinity binding parameters.
Evaluation of this panel of aptamers under identical conditions enabled
the first direct comparison across small molecule–aptamer binding
properties.

Materials and Methods
Aptamers (Table S1 of the Supporting Information) contain a 3′ 24-mer
poly(A) sequence for hybridization to
the sensor chip and were prepared as described in the Supporting Information. Experiments were performed
on a Biacore X100 (GE Healthcare). The DNA linker strand (5′-AmMC6-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT)
(Integrated DNA Technologies) was immobilized to the surface of a
CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare), as described in the Supporting Information. In all experiments, HBS-N running
buffer (GE Healthcare) was supplemented with the appropriate MgCl2 concentration (Life Technologies).

Details of the aptamer
assays are described in the Supporting Information. Briefly, priming and
startup cycles were performed to stabilize the sensorgram baseline.
The aptamer was captured onto the sample flow cell, and the target
solution was injected over both flow cells. The association and dissociation
phase lengths used for each target were chosen based on time needed
to reach equilibrium (Figure 1B and Figures
S1 and S2 of the Supporting Information). Aptamer and target were removed from the sensor surface by injecting
25 mM NaOH over both flow cells. Data analysis was performed using
Biacore X100 Evaluation Software, version 2.0 (GE Healthcare).

Results
and Discussion
In developing an improved method for characterizing
aptamer binding
properties to small molecules, we designed our method to (a) be label-free,
to avoid altering the target binding interaction or limiting use to
targets with suitable functional groups for labeling; (b) measure
target binding to the free aptamer rather than competitive binding
with an analogue15−19,45 or conformational reorganization;32 (c) be scalable, allowing different aptamer–target
pairs or binding conditions to be tested; (d) be capable of measuring
binding kinetics and equilibrium affinities; and (e) minimize and
monitor potential nonspecific interactions. To achieve these desired
characteristics, we employed an SPR-based system using a CM5 carboxymethylated
dextran sensor chip (Figure 1A), where a 24-mer
poly(T) single-stranded DNA linker is covalently immobilized directly
to the dextran surface and allows capture of an aptamer containing
a corresponding 24-mer poly(A) tail through hybridization.

The
CM5 chip’s high immobilization capacity is favorable
for analyzing small molecule interactions by maximizing the potential
binding signal (Figure S3 of the Supporting Information). The lack of protein components minimizes undesirable nonspecific
interactions and adverse effects of denaturing conditions on the stability
of the sensor surface. Use of a DNA linker instead of direct immobilization
enables surface regeneration for testing different aptamers, targets,
or conditions on the same chip. This hybridization capture strategy
also prevents either binding partner from being subjected to harsh
regeneration conditions, in contrast to systems in which one binding
partner is fixed to the surface and may degrade over time. Greater
stability is also achieved through covalent attachment of the linker
to the chip compared to noncovalent interactions such as streptavidin–biotin.
Each sensor surface includes two flow cells; the DNA linker is immobilized
onto both flow cells, but the reference flow cell lacks the aptamer.
The reference flow cell is used to monitor the presence of nonspecific
interactions between the target and sensor surface and resolve target-specific
binding from nonspecific responses.

Figure 1 SPR-based aptamer binding assay. (A) Schematic
of the sensor surface.
A poly(T) DNA linker is covalently immobilized onto the sensor surface.
The aptamer contains a poly(A) sequence and hybridizes to the DNA
linker. The target is flowed over the sensor surface, and the binding
interaction is monitored in real time. After each cycle, the surface
is regenerated to remove the aptamer and target. (B) Representative
SPR sensorgrams for the theophylline aptamer. The double-referenced
sensorgrams were fit to a 1:1 kinetic binding model (shown in black)
or steady-state affinity model (inset).

We first validated our SPR platform by measuring the binding
properties
of the well-studied theophylline aptamer.19 Its short length, high affinity, and specificity have contributed
to its broad use as a model aptamer for small molecule binding. A
series of theophylline concentrations spanning a 100-fold range around
the reported dissociation constant (KD) was measured. Aptamer capture levels were stable within each replicate,
with a coefficient of variation less than 3%. The double-referenced
sensorgrams were fit globally to a 1:1 kinetic binding model (Figure 1B) and a steady-state affinity model (Figure 1B inset). An association rate (ka) of (1.5 ± 0.1) × 105 M–1 s–1 and dissociation rate (kd) of 0.063 ± 0.004 s–1 were determined,
consistent with previously reported rates of (1.7 ± 0.2) ×
105 M–1 s–1 and 0.07
± 0.02 s–1, respectively.31 The KD of 430 ± 40 nM,
calculated as the ratio of the binding rates (KD,kinetic = kd/ka), compares well with that obtained from the steady-state
affinity model (KD,equilibrium) (340 ±
20 nM), both of which are consistent with previously reported values.19,31

A diverse panel of 12 aptamers was chosen to test the method’s
range and sensitivity (Table 1). Selected aptamers
are composed of RNA or DNA, span 25 to 96 nucleotides in length, are
derived from natural sources or in vitro selection, and exhibit reported
KD’s covering nearly 7 orders of magnitude, from
10 pM34 to 76 μM.15 Associated targets consist of 10 to 70 atoms, range from
75.1 to 690.4 g/mol in molecular weight, and serve varied biological
and chemical functions. Included are aptamers extensively used as
sensors4,13,46,47 and for which more detailed characterization of kinetic
and affinity properties would be useful, as well as aptamer pairs
that bind TPP and c-di-GMP to investigate whether these nucleic acids
employ distinct strategies for binding to the same molecular target.
All aptamers were characterized under identical conditions (10 mM
HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM MgCl2 at pH 7.4 and 25 °C),
enabling the first direct comparison of the binding properties of
a broad set of small molecule-binding aptamers.

The 35FMN-2
flavin mononucleotide,16 minimal MG-4 malachite
green,28 and TCT8-4
theophylline19 in vitro selected aptamers
display similar binding properties, with KD’s in the mid-nanomolar to low-micromolar range and similar
binding rates (Table 1). Three in vitro selected
RNA aptamers for amino acids, the 44.Arg11 arginine,15 44.Cit11 citrulline,15 and minimal
Tyr 1 tyrosine,17 and the in vitro selected
DH25.42 DNA aptamer for ATP20 exhibit similar
binding properties, with KD’s in
the low- to mid-micromolar range. These aptamers reach equilibrium
quickly (<5 s) (Figure S1 of the Supporting
Information), precluding kinetic analysis on the specific instrument
used.48 We report the first KD determination for the minimal tyrosine aptamer and unmodified
ATP aptamer for ATP. Unable to be determined by equilibrium filtration,20 the ATP aptamer’s KD for ATP is similar to its affinity for adenosine20 and suggests minimal involvement of the triphosphate
group in binding, in agreement with structural studies.49 Similarities in binding properties across this
set of in vitro selected aptamers suggest that selection procedures
and target structure influence resulting affinity and kinetic properties.
The rank order in selection immobilization concentration is consistent
with the KD for six of these seven aptamers,
with a strong positive correlation for five (R2 = 0.99) (Figure S4 of the Supporting
Information). This correlation underscores the significant
impact that selection parameters have on resulting aptamer binding
properties, suggesting that optimized in vitro selection procedures
may improve resulting aptamer affinities through increased selection
stringency.

Five aptamer domains from natural riboswitches were
also characterized:
the Vibrio cholerae c-di-GMP class
I riboswitch,21 the Clostridium
difficile c-di-GMP class II riboswitch,22 domain II of the V. cholerae glycine riboswitch,23 the Thi1 domain
of the Bacillus anthracis TPP riboswitch,24 and the minimal Escherichia coli thiM TPP riboswitch25 (Table 1). With the exception of the c-di-GMP class II domain,
the remaining natural aptamers approach equilibrium slowly (>180
s)
(Figure S2 of the Supporting Information) and, consequently, KD,equilibrium values
could not be accurately obtained. Most affinity characterization methods
rely on the assumption that equilibrium has been reached but, unlike
SPR, do not provide a means for confirmation and therefore risk incomplete
binding.34 Three of the natural aptamers
tested exhibited subnanomolar to nanomolar KD’s, demonstrating the high affinities achievable for
RNA–small molecule interactions.

Class I and class II
c-di-GMP riboswitch domains do not share sequence
or structural homology and employ distinct target recognition mechanisms.50 The class I domain exhibits the tightest reported KD for an RNA–small molecule interaction.34 However, this value is inconsistent with other
reported KD values that are at least 100-fold
higher;21,51,52 some of this
variation may result from the use of modified sequences in a flexible
stem loop in different studies. The ka at 5 mM MgCl2 of the class I domain differs by only 1.4-fold
from the 1.7 × 104 M–1 s–1 reported at 10 mM MgCl2.34 In contrast, its kd is 120-fold greater
than the 1.8 × 10–7 s–1 reported,34 potentially signaling differential Mg2+ sensitivity between the binding rates of the class I domain. Our
characterization provides the first kinetic analysis of the class
II domain. Comparing both classes, the class II domain has a 6.9-fold
higher ka, 420-fold higher kd, and a 61-fold higher KD. These differences in kinetic and affinity properties may allow
differential biological regulatory functions in response to the same
small molecule input.50

With only
10 atoms, glycine is one of the smallest targets for
a nucleic acid–small molecule interaction and was selected
to test method sensitivity. Characterized at 5 mM MgCl2, the KD (200 ± 120 μM) of
the glycine aptamer is consistent with previous reports, in between
45.9 μM measured at 10 mM MgCl2 and greater than
1 mM measured at 2 mM MgCl2.53 The glycine riboswitch is highly sensitive to Mg2+ concentration,
with an approximate 300-fold increase in KD with a 10-fold drop in Mg2+ concentration.53 To confirm this divalent ion sensitivity, we
tested the glycine aptamer at 20 mM MgCl2 and obtained
a KD of 3.5 ± 1.0 μM, consistent
with the value of 3.5 μM obtained by ITC.53 Its KD decreases by 58-fold
with a 4-fold increase in Mg2+ concentration, asymmetrically
comprising a 26-fold increase in ka and
2.2-fold decrease in kd. Our study provides
the first kinetic analysis for this riboswitch domain and observation
of the differential effects of Mg2+ concentration on its
kinetic parameters.

In-line probing experiments observed a 140-fold
difference in KD between the Thi1 and thiM TPP aptamers under identical buffer conditions with
20 mM MgCl2.24,25 However, with our method
at 5 mM MgCl2, these aptamers showed nearly equivalent KD’s, differing by only 1.6-fold and possibly
indicating
differential Mg2+ sensitivity between these sequences.
Both TPP aptamers demonstrate similar binding rates, with thiM exhibiting a 2.7-fold greater ka and 1.7-fold greater kd. Their
comparable binding properties are not unexpected, as they share conserved
nucleotides and similar structural architectures.54 The thiMka is consistent with its rate for aptamer folding upon TPP binding.32 The thiMKD is below previously reported values by ITC38 and in-line probing25 conducted at different Mg2+ concentrations; however,
the ITC experiments reported difficulty measuring the KD due to a steep binding transition under conditions needed
to generate sufficient heat for measurement.38 In addition, kinetic values obtained for both TPP aptamers closely
agree with the E. colithiC TPP aptamer’s ka and kd of 1.26 × 105 M–1 s–1 and 2.9 × 10–4 s–1, respectively,36 further
supporting the shared binding characteristics of this family of riboswitches.

The described SPR-based characterization platform presents several
advantages over traditional aptamer characterization methods. The
high-throughput process can be automated and accurately measures a
wide range of KD’s. Traditional
methods are often limited to KD measurements
in the nanomolar range,37 whereas SPR is
capable of measuring much lower values.55 With other methods, nonspecific binding is difficult to decouple
from target-specific binding.56 In contrast,
nonspecific interactions with the SPR surface can be measured and
accounted for using a reference flow cell. Furthermore, other methods
may not accurately measure KD if the approach
to complex equilibrium is slow and equilibrium is not reached in the
timeframe of the assay.34 The SPR-based
assay monitors binding response in realtime and supports both kinetic
and equilibrium analyses; the use of two approaches allows for more
confident measurement of KD. Emphasizing
this platform’s consistency, KD,kinetic and KD,equilibrium values measured for
the same target differ no more than 2.1-fold from one another. Similarly,
all KD,kinetic and KD,equilibrium values measured differ no more than 2.2-fold
from the nearest previously reported KD at identical Mg2+ concentration.

Our aptamer characterization
assay addresses many limitations of
previously reported SPR-based methods. The described method covalently
immobilizes a DNA linker to a chemically resistant dextran-based sensor
surface, and the resulting sensor chips are stable for approximately
500 assay cycles. Most importantly, the dextran-based surface offers
more reactive sites than streptavidin-based surfaces for immobilizing
the DNA linker, increasing the method’s sensitivity by increasing
aptamer capture levels and resulting small molecule binding signals.
Furthermore, this platform can be directly extended to protein targets
and aptamers containing modified nucleotides or expanded genetic alphabets.

A few limitations of our SPR-based assay are important to note.
Aptamer capture via hybridization requires adding a 3′ poly(A)
linker. However, the linker is not expected to affect aptamer folding
or target binding and may be moved to the 5′ end or have its
sequence altered with a corresponding change in the DNA linker. As
many biosensor platforms immobilize aptamers through a linker-hybridized
strategy,57 performing our assay using
a similar setup may streamline integration of aptamers directly into
biosensing platforms. The high density surface used to maximize small
molecule binding response has the potential to facilitate rebinding
events or limit mass transport and thereby affect kinetic measurements;
however, the high flow rate58 used reduces
the likelihood of target rebinding or mass transport limitation. Lastly,
our method does not provide structural, enthalpic, or mechanistic
details on aptamer folding and binding, which can be obtained using
complementary techniques such as chemical probing, crystallography,
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, ITC, or single-molecule studies.

Conclusion
Traditional aptamer characterization methods are limited in their
throughput, scalability, and information content and have contributed
to the lack of development, adoption, and application of novel aptamers.59 To address this limitation, we developed and
validated a high-throughput and scalable SPR-based strategy for characterizing
aptamer binding to small molecules. Using this platform, we characterized
12 aptamer–small molecule pairs that display a range of molecular
weights, compositions, and affinities. To our knowledge, this study
is the first kinetic binding characterization of the flavin mononucleotide,
malachite green, c-di-GMP class II, glycine, Thi1 TPP, and thiM TPP aptamers and first affinity characterization of
a minimal tyrosine aptamer and unmodified DNA aptamer for ATP. This
analysis is the first characterization of a diverse and large subset
of small molecule–aptamer pairs using a single platform under
identical conditions.

Our aptamer characterization strategy
supports the rapid characterization
of aptamer binding properties and can be readily coupled to in vitro
selection strategies to (a) screen selection libraries, (b) characterize
functional sequences, (c) identify minimal binding sequences, (d)
perform mutagenic analysis, (e) determine binding specificity, and
(f) assess binding under varying environmental conditions. In combination
with structural studies, this method can provide information on riboswitch
binding at physiological conditions and guide our understanding of
riboswitch function.

Development of standard practices for aptamer
selection, characterization,
and platform integration would extend their application beyond the
small subset of aptamers used in proof-of-concept studies and accelerate
the associated design cycle.4,14 For example, approximately
60 small molecule-binding RNA aptamers have been selected and characterized
in vitro,2 yet theophylline overwhelmingly
remains the sensing component used for in vivo engineered RNA-based
gene regulatory devices.13 Aptamer candidates
could be functionally validated with our platform under relevant conditions
and included within libraries of standard biological parts.60 Validated RNA aptamer sensors can then be more
reliably coupled to methods for engineering RNA devices61 and multicomponent systems to extend their use
in synthetic biology applications. Thus, the described SPR-based aptamer
characterization platform provides a versatile and powerful characterization
tool that can be integrated with aptamer selection to advance functional
nucleic acid design.
