Dextran hydrolysis-mediated conversion
of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-dextran
(DEX) aqueous two-phase system droplets to a single phase was used
to directly visualize Dextranase activity. DEX droplets were formed
either by manual micropipetting or within a continuous PEG phase by
computer controlled actuation of an orifice connecting rounded channels
formed by backside diffused light lithography. The time required for
the two-phase to one-phase transition was dependent on the Dextranase
concentration, pH of the medium, and temperature. The apparent Michaelis
constants for Dextranase were estimated based on previously reported
catalytic constants, the binodal polymer concentration curves for
PEG-DEX phase transition for each temperature, and pH condition. The
combination of a microfluidic droplet system and phase transition
observation provides a new method for label-free direct measurement
of enzyme activity.

Assays for
measuring the degradation
of dextran (DEX) either require the use of specially prepared labeled
polymers as surrogate substrates1 or indirect
measurement of degradation products, such as the amount of reducing
sugar activity hydrolytically released from DEX.2 Here, we describe a label-free direct visualization assay
for the measurement of Dextranase activity that utilizes the observation
of phase transitions of aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) droplets into
one phase.

ATPSs are formed when two immiscible water-based
solutions, usually
composed of long-chain polymers, are mixed at concentrations above
which it is thermodynamically favorable for the solutions to phase-separate
into discrete regions.3 This thermodynamic
phenomenon is influenced by a variety of factors including pH, temperature,
ionic content, solute/polymer concentration, and the molecular weight
of the phase-separating constituents.4 For
aqueous polymer solutions of a given weight/weight concentration,
solutions composed of larger molecular weight polymers phase-separate
more readily because of the smaller entropic cost to demix the smaller
number of distinct polymer chains. Thus, when an enzyme hydrolyzes
polymers within an ATPS, phase separation becomes less favorable because
either the weight/weight concentrations of the long-chain polymer
decrease or the long-chain polymers become fragmented into shorter
chains. While observations of hydrolysis-triggered phase transitions
of macroscopic ATPSs requires large amounts of enzyme, reducing the
volume of the polymer substrate phases using microfluidic principles
makes such phase transition processes practical for the measurement
of enzyme activity, thereby increasing throughput and reducing the
amounts of reagents used.

The polyethylene glycol (PEG)-DEX
ATPS is one of the most widely
used ATPSs in laboratory science5 and industry.
The concentrations (typically expressed in terms of weight/weight)
of PEG and DEX of certain molecular weights required for phase separation
are described by binodal polymer concentration curves, as shown in
Figure 1. A two-phase system will transition
to a single phase if the concentrations of one or both polymers are
decreased below the critical concentrations displayed by the binodal
curve (Figure 1A). If one considers a phase
diagram based on molar concentrations (a less common way to present
ATPS phase diagrams), as the polymer molecular weight decreases the
binodal curve shifts up. This means that even if the molar concentration
of DEX and PEG remains constant, as the DEX molecular weight decreases
due to degradation, the binodal curve shifts such that the same molar
concentrations of polymers no longer produce phase separation. Dextranase
degrades DEX to cause the DEX microdroplets formed in the PEG phase
solutions to disappear due to phase transition (Figure 1A, right to left pointing horizontal arrow; Figure 1B, shifting of the binodal curve).

Figure 1 Binodal phase diagram
for the PEG 35 000/DEX 500 000
system. (A) A two-phase system can be converted to a single phase
either by dilution or by degradation of DEX by Dextranase. This graph
focuses on the weight % concentration of DEX 500 000. (B) Another
representation of how a two-phase system can be converted to a single
phase either by dilution or by degration of DEX by Dextranase. This
graph focuses on the molar concentration of long chain DEX of various
molecular weights. As Dextranase digests DEX, the molar concentration
remains the same for a significant time, but the average long chain
DEX molecular weight decreases. As the molecular weight of DEX decreases,
the molar concentration of DEX does not decrease, but the binodal
curve shifts up because a higher concentration of PEG is required
to form an ATPS with the same molar concentration of lower molecular
weight DEX. The molar concentration point designated by the circle
corresponds to 2.5% PEG 35 000/3.2% DEX 500 000.

DEX hydrolysis by Dextranase is
of significance to both the sugar/carbohydrate
polymer industry and dental medicine. Here, we apply the thermodynamic
principle of phase transition to measuring the enzymatic activity
of Dextranase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes the α-(1,6) glycosidic
bonds of DEX to produce smaller oligosaccharides. We use well-plate
and microfluidic droplet-based ATPS assays to demonstrate that the
time it takes to transition a droplet-based PEG-DEX ATPS to a single
phase depends on enzyme activity, as modulated by enzyme concentration,
temperature, and pH of the ATPS solution. On the basis of our data,
this process is not diffusion limited for the droplet sizes and enzyme
concentrations we tested. The Michaelis constants for Dextranase activity
are estimated for the various assay formats and enzyme conditions.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals and Reagents
DEX, average molecular weight
500 000, was purchased from Pharmacosmos (Denmark). Dextranase
and PEG (average molecular weight 35 000) were both purchased
from Sigma (MO). Microfluidic devices were fabricated from Sylgard
184 polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and curing agent, both purchased from
Dow Chemical (MI). The master molds from which the microfluidic devices
were replica-molded consisted of SU-8 from MicroChem (MA) patterned
on glass coverslips from Fisher Scientific (MA).

Aqueous Two-Phase
Systems
For the well-plate assays,
a biphasic system composed of 2.5% PEG 35 000, 3.2% DEX T500,
and PBS was formed. The equilibrated PEG and DEX phases were collected
for Dextranase testing. For the microfluidic tests, ATPSs were formed
from near-critical point DEX (∼3.2% w/w) + 0.01% w/w FITC-DEX
and PEG (2.5% w/w) in PBS. The ATPSs were equilibrated at room temperature
and centrifuged at 600 rcf before use. For all Dextranase experiments,
the pH was adjusted by addition of 1 N HCl to the PBS before incorporation
of the polymers. Dextranase was added from a highly concentrated stock
of 500 U/mL to achieve the appropriate concentration, where U is defined
as 1 μmol of DEX degraded per minute in a pH 6.0 solution at
37 °C. Solutions were then stored on ice to prevent unwanted
Dextranase activity.

Dextranase Well-Plate Assays
Images
were acquired at
specific time points (up to 210 min) to test the effects of Dextranase
concentration (5, 2, 0.5, 0.2, 0.05, and 0.02 U/mL), pH (6.0 and 7.4)
and temperature (25 and 37 °C) on DEX droplet degradation. After
collection of the purified DEX and PEG phases, an appropriate amount
of Dextranase was first added only to the DEX phase. After a defined
preincubation period, 0.5 μL droplets of DEX/enzyme mixture
were micropipetted into 48-well assay plates containing 200 μL
of PEG in each well. The micropipetting step took no longer than 5
s. After 20 s, images of the DEX droplets were captured to definitively
confirm the loss of the phase boundary and rule out the possibility
of misidentifying a phase boundary due to differences in the refractive
index of the solutions. The appearance of a stable interface between
the DEX droplets and the bulk PEG phase indicated phase separation.
Droplet dynamics, including spreading or contraction after droplet
addition, were also noted. For the relatively few time points where
phase transition could not be definitively confirmed, additional time
points were collected and the average time between the first indication
of interface disappearance (dramatic droplet expansion due to loss
of interfacial tension and barely visible phase boundary) and definitive
interface disappearance (clearly no phase boundary) was considered
as the DEX degradation time. This type of experiment with preincubation
of a DEX phase only solution followed by periodic addition of small
aliquots of the degraded DEX phase solution into a PEG phase is important
for obtaining insights into the role of diffusion (or lack thereof)
versus reaction, since all of the DEX reactions take place without
diffusion into PEG until the DEX droplets are added to PEG. The procedure,
however, is tedious. Thus, to demonstrate improved time resolution
with less hands-on activity from the experimenter, we also performed
experiments where we dispensed DEX droplets containing Dextranase
into the PEG solution and used time-lapse imaging every 2 s from 0
to 120 min to observe DEX droplet degradation continuously using single
small droplets.

Droplet Generating Device Fabrication
Microfluidic
devices were fabricated using backside diffused light lithography,
as described previously.6 Briefly, an SU-8-coated
glass coverslip was exposed from the back (glass side) to UV illumination
passing through a photomask. Rounded multilevel structures were developed
in the photoresist using a discontinuous pattern on the photomask,
such that light passing through the photoresist and the glass slide
was scattered, exposing the SU-8 in the region corresponding to the
discontinuity to less illumination. This diffuse light from both discontinuous
ends joined to form a channel constriction (orifice) at the hydrodynamic
focusing junction. The positive features from the photoresist were
replica-molded using conventional soft lithography in PDMS to form
elastomeric channels that were subsequently plasma-bonded to a PDMS
membrane (100 μm thickness) fabricated by spin coating at 200
rpm for 240 s followed by 2000 rpm for 5 s. The channel geometries
were designed to align with a Braille pin-array that was programmed
to actuate the channel constriction to induce droplet formation, as
described previously.7

Microfluidic
Droplet Formation
The appropriate amount
of Dextranase was added to the DEX solution, which was stored on ice
to limit the Dextranase activity. This solution was loaded into a
cold syringe and placed on a syringe pump. Ice packs were used to
keep the syringe and tubing connected to the device cool. Using the
flow focusing channel, a threading regime was produced by syringe
pump-driven flow at 0.01 mL/h and 0.07 mL/h for the DEX and PEG phases,
respectively. An actuating Braille pin was placed underneath the orifice
in the center channel to control the flow of DEX at 0.8333 Hz. The
Braille pin was controlled using a customized circuit-board connected
to a computer through a universal serial bus (USB) with its own custom
user interface. The entire process of loading the chilled DEX/Dextranase
solution and aligning the device prior to droplet generation lasted
no longer than 15 min. Droplet flow was arrested by collapsing the
upstream and downstream channel regions using clamps. This produced
a closed system that allowed time-lapse imaging of droplet dynamics
in the presence of Dextranase. Droplets were imaged by fluorescence
and brightfield microscopy (Nikon TS100, Tokyo, Japan), with images
acquired every 30 s for the control and 0.02 U/mL Dextranase conditions
and every 10 s for the 5 U/mL Dextranase condition. For microfluidic
enzyme tests at temperatures above normal room temperature (∼25
°C), the entire microscope room temperature was raised using
climate control and further raised to 45 °C using a heat gun
(Black & Decker, CT). The temperature was continually monitored
using a thermometer and the room thermostat. Heating the entire room
guaranteed a constant temperature for the microfluidic device and
limited the effects of thermal gradients on the PEG-DEX ATPS.

Calculation
of Michaelis Constants
The phase transition
weight percentages of DEX for different DEX chain lengths at 2.5%
PEG 35 000 for pH 7.4 at 25 °C were plotted and fitted
with a power curve (Supplemental Figure 1 in the Supporting Information). The points in the graph were based
on experimental phase diagrams and previously published phase diagrams
for PEG 35 000 and DEX 500 000 (Supplemental Figure
2 in the Supporting Information), DEX 100 000,8 DEX 40 000,9 and DEX 10 000. The initial point of our ATPS corresponded
to 2.5% PEG 35 000 and 3.2% DEX 500 000. As Dextranase
digests the 500 000 g/mol DEX chain, the weight decreases proportionately
to the fraction of the chain length digested. The expected molecular
weight of DEX in the Dextranase assay at which phase transition occurs
following Dextranase digestion is estimated to be 1.84% DEX 287 000
g/mol. The main products from digestion are glucose, isomaltose, isomaltotriose,
and larger oligosaccharides.10 We assumed
that these products had insignificant contributions to phase formation.

The Michaelis–Menten kinetics allowed a comparison of the
microwell assays and the microfluidic assay. For a given pH, the Kcat of the assay is constant, while the Km changes. Varying the temperature from 37 to
25 °C changes the Kcat according
to the Arrhenius equation and also affects the Km. The Km is described as  where [E] is the enzyme
concentration, [S]
is the concentration of long chain DEX, and [P] is the concentration
of isomaltotriose. The rate constant at 37 °C is given by the
manufacturer as 1.0 μmol/min/U. The activation energy, Ea, of the Arrhenius equation was determined
from a previous study.11 Thus, the Kcat at 25 °C is 0.86 μmol/min/U.
A Dextranase concentration of 2.0 U/mL was used for the well-plate
assay calculations, and a concentration of 5.0 U/mL was used for the
microfluidic assay calculations. Our experimental phase diagrams indicated
that the phase transition weight percentage for DEX 500 000
varied only slightly with temperature and pH (from 1.466% to 1.543%).
As such, identical values for [S] and [P] (6.4 × 10–8 and 2.7 × 10–5 mol/mL, respectively) were
used for each condition. [S] is based on the initial starting DEX
concentration and [P] is calculated from the number of DEX chains
(6.4 × 10–8) multiplied by the number of isomaltotriose
units (504.44 g/mol) released per chain as it is digested from 500 000
g/mol to 287 000 g/mol (422). In this model, [S] (mol/mL) is
approximated to be constant over time. This is not unreasonable, as
the molar concentration of long-chain DEX is assumed not to change
significantly within the time frame of our experiments. Instead, the
molecular weight of the DEX decreases with enzymatic digestion. As
isomaltotriose is released from each DEX chain, the DEX chain length
will decrease, as will the weight percentage of DEX. Thus, the Km values for the various long-chain DEX polymers
are expected to be similar. On the basis of these parameters, we calculated
the Michaelis constants (Km values) as
shown in Table 1.

the additional time (including the time where temperature was kept
low) that the DEX solution was exposed to Dextranase during microfluidic
droplet generation preparation.

Results and Discussion
In this work, we maintained a constant
PEG concentration, while
degrading DEX by digesting it with Dextranase. This resulted in a
decrease in the weight/weight concentration of the largest molecular
weight DEX species (Figure 1A, right to left
pointing horizontal arrow), while the molar concentration and total
DEX-associated material mass of the system remained relatively constant.
A two-phase to one-phase transition occurs when there is a decrease
in weight/weight concentration of the original high molecular weight
DEX (Figure 1A) or, if focusing on molar concentration
of DEX of any molecular weight, when the molecular weights of the
DEX decrease causing an upward shift of the binodal curve (Figure 1B). In contrast, diluting the solution would decrease
the concentrations of both PEG and DEX and increase the overall volume
of the solutions (Figure 1A, arrow toward the
origin and Figure 1B).

We first tested
the enzymatic hydrolysis-mediated aqueous two-phase
system transition using DEX solution droplets of 0.5 μL formed
by pipetting into a well-plate filled with PEG solution. Dextranase
activity was modulated using three parameters: pH, temperature, and
Dextranase concentration (Figure 2). Determination
of two-phase to one-phase conversion was based on time-lapse experiments
where aliquots of DEX phase solutions preincubated with Dextranase
were added to a PEG phase at designated time intervals and the phase
boundary at the DEX-PEG interface was observed immediately (∼20
s) after addition to the PEG phase. At a few time points, only a portion
of the boundary was visible. In those cases, the droplet system was
determined to be in an intermediate state. In all cases, the intermediate
state underwent two-phase to one-phase conversion by the time the
next time point was observed. Increasing the pH from 6.0 to 7.4 increased
the Dextranase-mediated time to DEX droplet degradation (i.e., the
conversion from having the ability to maintain two-phases when added
to the PEG phase to immediately becoming a one-phase upon addition)
by ∼3-fold (Figure 2A,B). Reducing the
temperature from 37 to 25 °C also increased the time to DEX droplet
degradation. Dextranase concentration was inversely proportional to
time to DEX droplet degradation, displaying a nearly linear relationship;
for example, when the Dextranase concentration was increased by 10-fold,
the DEX droplet degradation time decreased by ∼10-fold. These
experiments where the DEX phase solutions were degraded first then
added to the PEG phase solutions are important for confirming that
the inability of the degraded DEX phase solution to form a two-phase
system is not dependent on diffusion of the degraded molecules away
from the DEX phase droplet. Rather, when a DEX droplet fails to form
a two-phase system, it is mainly because the DEX polymers have been
degraded sufficiently that phase separation cannot occur even though
all of the original DEX polymer materials are still present (Figure 1). After dispensing the Dextranase-degraded DEX
droplets into the PEG phase, the droplets generally spread out due
to their low interfacial tension with the PEG phase, which makes the
droplets flatter (Figure 2C). We also carried
out a similar well-plate assay, in which DEX/FITC-DEX/Dextranase droplets
were immediately placed in a PEG-filled well and observed by time-lapse
imaging at 2 s intervals. The DEX droplet expanded over the course
of imaging, before apparent voids began to appear in the droplet interior
at ∼35 min (Figure 2D). By 50 min, the
droplet was completely consumed (see the Supplemental Video in the Supporting Information). We considered the 35
min time point to be the point at which the two-phase to one-phase
transition occurred in this assay.

Figure 2 Two-phase to one-phase conversion occurs
following Dextranase-mediated
DEX degradation. (A,B) Dextranase activity can be assessed in a well-plate
by recording the time at which DEX droplets preincubated with Dextranase
no longer form phase boundaries with PEG. DEX droplet degradation
times vary by pH, temperature, and Dextranase concentration. A maxium
incubation time of 210 min was used for these assays. (C) Phase separation
(or lack thereof) of DEX droplets preincubated with 2 U/mL Dextranase
for 2, 10, and 30 min at pH 7.4, 37 °C as they are added into
PEG. The black arrows indicate the phase boundary. (D) Phase separation
of DEX droplets containing FITC-DEX and 5 U/mL Dextranase (without
preincubation) in PEG, as recorded by fluorescence time-lapse imaging.
The white arrow indicates the initial location of the void that indicated
droplet degradation and the conversion of the ATPS to a single phase
(see the Supplemental Video in the Supporting
Information for additional data points). The 35 min time point
was considered the transition point from two phases to one phase.

This ATPS well-plate assay can
be adapted for analysis of Dextranase
activity in other aqueous solutions such as industrial/manufacturing
batch solutions, cell culture media, and bacterial broth by simply
observing the DEX-PEG phase transition. For more sensitive detection
that may be necessary to assess small-scale bacterial Dextranase production,
the assay detection limit can be lowered by decreasing the amount
of DEX degradation required for two-phase to one-phase conversion.
This can be achieved by using an ATPS composition that is closer to
the binodal curve.

We next used a microfluidic device12 to produce single- to subnanoliter DEX droplets
to increase the
throughput of the assay and demonstrate the potential for automated,
chip-based analysis (Figure 3A–C). Without actuation from a computer-controlled
pin, a laminar stream of DEX was formed in the microfluidic channel,
enclosed by two streams of PEG. Upon actuation, flow was interrupted,
resulting in formation of DEX droplets carrying FITC-DEX as a tracer
material (Figure 3B). The FITC-DEX is not needed
for purposes of measuring Dextranase activity but was included to
help understand some of the dynamics of the degradation and droplet
content release process, as will be explained below. We also monitored
the droplets by brightfield microscopy.

Figure 3 Operating principle of
the droplet-generating device. (A) A central
DEX inlet is flanked by two PEG inlets. The channel constriction is
actuated by a computer controlled pin positioned at the black dashed
circle. (B) Without actuation this constriction is open, resulting
in the formation of a laminar stream of DEX in the center of the channel.
Pin actuation at an appropriate frequency closes the constriction
to produce droplets of DEX. The DEX phase was visualized using a FITC-DEX
tracer. (C) Droplets generated microfluidically allow sensitive detection
of enzyme activity. Droplet degradation was not observed when Dextranase
was absent from the ATPS. (D) The preincubated well- plate assay produces
comparable results for 0.02 U/mL Dextranase at pH 6.0, 45 °C.

In the absence of Dextranase,
the droplets maintained their size,
fluorescence intensity, and phase boundaries (Figure 3C, first column). The addition of Dextranase caused the degradation
of the droplet emulsion into a single phase. At room temperature and
a pH of 7.4, a high concentration of Dextranase (5 U/mL) was required
to degrade the DEX droplets in a timely manner as these conditions
are enzymatically not optimal (Figure 3C, second
column). By adjusting the pH to 6.0 and increasing the temperature
to 45 °C (the optimal enzymatic conditions for Dextranase), the
DEX droplets could be degraded using much lower concentrations of
Dextranase (0.02 U/mL) (Figure 3C, third column).
We confirmed the time scale of droplet disappearance under this condition
using the preincubated well-plate assays (Figure 3C, fourth column). These observations suggest various possibilities
for designing rapid or gradual DEX-hydrolysis-triggered release of
reagents from the DEX droplets.

To compare the different assay
formats and enzyme degradation conditions,
we calculated the Michaelis constants based on Michaelis–Menten
kinetics and the binodal polymer concentration curves for the PEG-DEX
ATPS (Table 1; binodal curves shown in Supplemental
Figure 1 in the Supporting Information).
The similarities in time to transitioning to one-phase between the
DEX droplets preincubated with Dextranase before PEG addition and
those that were incubated after addition to PEG, and the mechanistic
explanation of Figure 1B suggest that the process
of DEX/PEG two-phase to one-phase transition due to Dextranase degradation
of DEX is not limited by diffusing away the degraded DEX. That is,
DEX degradation products do not have to diffuse away for the phase
transition to occur. Thus, our assay should be minimally influenced
thermodynamically by changes in droplet scale. We do note, however,
that there is slightly more ambiguity as to exactly when one considers
a droplet to have transitioned to one phase (e.g., Figure 2D, 35 min) for larger droplets compared to smaller
drops. As expected, the Michaelis constant decreased under conditions
that were more favorable to enzymatic degradation of DEX (i.e., higher
temperature and lower pH).

Our droplet dispersion technology
has applications in the field
of microfluidics,13 where in the future
it may be applied for microfluidic chemical reactions14 or creating dynamic chemical gradients for studying cell
signaling applications by compartmentalizing and releasing reagents
or cell signaling factors. Since eukaryotic cells typically do not
produce DEX and have few important glycosidic bonds hydrolyzed by
Dextranase on their surface, the process may serve as a mild, cell
culture-friendly, and localized controlled reagent-release mechanism.
Dextranase is also of interest in clinical dentistry as it is secreted
by oral bacteria that modify the formation of dental plaques and use
the plaque constituents (including DEX) as a source of nutrients.1 With the ability to detect Dextranase activities
as low as 0.020 U/mL in less than 90 min (robust oral Dextranase-producing
bacteria such as P. Oralis secrete
extracellular Dextranase up to 0.490 U/mL1), it may be possible to analyze oral microbial flora using our system.
Finally, highly sensitive Dextranase activity testing can be helpful
in the sugar cane industry for early detection of costly and potentially
destructive contamination, as well as for standardization of Dextranase
enzymes used industrially to prevent DEX accumulation during sugar
production.15 While we focus on just the
analysis of Dextranase activity, the concept of using aqueous two-phase
system droplet transitions to directly visualize polymer hydrolyzing
enzyme activity may be applicable to other biopolymer ATPSs as well.
