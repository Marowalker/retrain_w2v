MALDI mass-spectrometry
imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a technique capable
of the label-free identification and visualization of analytes in
tissue sections. We have previously applied MALDI-MSI to the study
of the spatial distribution of tuberculosis (TB) drugs in necrotic
lung granulomas characteristic of pulmonary TB disease, revealing
heterogeneous and often suboptimal drug distributions. To investigate
the impact of differential drug distributions at sites of infection,
we sought to image mycobacterial biomarkers to coregister drugs and
bacteria in lesion sections. The traditional method of visualizing Mycobacterium tuberculosis inside lesions is acid-fast staining
and microscopy. Directly analyzing and visualizing mycobacteria-specific
lipid markers by MALDI-MSI provides detailed molecular information
on bacterial distributions within granulomas, complementary to high-spatial-resolution
staining and microscopy approaches. Moreover, spatial monitoring of
molecular changes occurring in bacteria during granuloma development
can potentially contribute to a greater understanding of pulmonary-TB
pathogenesis. In this study, we developed a MALDI-MSI method to detect
and visualize specific glycolipids of mycobacteria within TB lesions.
The biomarker signal correlated well with the bacteria visualized
by IHC and acid-fast staining. This observation was seen in samples
collected from multiple animal models. Although individual bacteria
could not be visualized because of the limit of spatial resolution
(50 μm), bacterial clusters were clearly detected and heterogeneously
distributed throughout lesions. The ability to visualize drugs, metabolites,
and bacterial biomarkers by MALDI-MSI enabled direct colocalization
of drugs with specific bacterial target populations (identifiable
by distinct metabolic markers). Future applications include assessing
drug activity in lesions by visualizing drug-mediated lipid changes
and other drug-induced mycobacterial metabolic responses.

==== Body
Almost one-third
of the world’s
population is infected with M. tuberculosis (MTB),
the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), resulting in the development
of the active disease in an estimated 16 million people worldwide.1 The pulmonary granuloma is the pathological hallmark
of TB disease. Of the multiple morphologically distinct types of granuloma,
closed necrotic lesions and cavities typically display the highest
bacterial burden and correlate with poor clinical outcomes.2 Softening and subsequent liquefaction of the
central caseum is thought to result in a substantial replication of
the bacterial load. The ability of antituberculosis drugs to penetrate
such lesions at sterilizing concentrations and reach the bacteria
residing within is crucial for effective therapy.3 An effective label-free method of visualizing drug4,5 and lipid6,7 distributions within tissues can be obtained
by MALDI-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI). We have previously
used MALDI-MSI to image the distribution of multiple TB drugs in pulmonary
lesions in marmoset, rabbit,8 and mouse9 disease models and in clinical samples.10 Accurate colocalization of MTB populations with
drug distribution is essential to determine whether the drug is reaching
its target.

Bacterial burdens within tissues are traditionally
visualized by
acid-fast staining and microscopic examination of tissue sections.11 Because of their impenetrable, waxy cell wall,
mycobacteria stain acid-fast by retaining a red dye (carbol fuchsin)
after being rinsed with acid solvents (the dye is rinsed from non-acid-fast
cells). The most commonly used acid-fast stains for visualizing mycobacteria
are the Ziehl–Neelsen (ZN) stain and, more recently, the auramine-rhodamine
stain. This technique is rapid, sensitive, and inexpensive. The targets
of the various clinically used acid-fast stains are generally thought
to be mycobacterial cell-wall components. However, the expression
of mycolic acids and other cell-wall components, as well as their
accessibility to dyes, might be variable depending on the metabolic
state of the bacillary population in the specific in vitro or in vivo
environment. Mycobacteria are therefore known to lose their acid-fastness
under hostile environmental conditions leading to metabolic and physiological
adaptations.12,13 Recently developed imaging approaches
include labeling the bacteria with MTB-specific antigens (such as
antigen 85)14 or using a nucleic acid binding
dye (SYBR Gold).15 In contrast to the currently
used acid-fast stains, SYBR Gold binds to both single- and double-stranded
DNA as well as RNA, and therefore most bacteria will contain sufficient
nucleic acid material to ensure consistent staining regardless of
their metabolic or replicative state.16 Confocal-microscopy techniques have the advantage of identifying
acid-fast and acid-negative bacteria at single-cell resolutions, but
they remain time-consuming.

An alternative approach to assess
bacterial loads within granulomas
is the culture and quantification of colony-forming units (CFU) within
homogenized granulomas. This method is highly sensitive, but it is
labor- and time-intensive (colonies are required to grow for up to
6 weeks prior to counting). Additionally, because of the highly heterogeneous
bacterial distributions within granulomas, homogenization causes a
loss of valuable information on the spatial distribution of bacterial
populations throughout the entire lesion.

The application of
mass spectrometry imaging technologies to visualize
microbes and microbial products has been reviewed in detail.17 Here we apply a label-free MALDI-MSI approach
to detect and visualize a specific class of mycobacterial glycolipids,
phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides (PIMs), within TB lesions. The
mycobacterial cell envelope has a multilaminate structure composed
of a plasma membrane; a cell wall made of covalently linked peptidoglycan,
arabinogalactan, and mycolic acids; and an outer layer of diverse
glycolipids including phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol
mannoside (PIM), phtiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM), trehalose dimycolate
(TDM), lipoarabinomannan (LAM), lipomannan (LM), cardiolipin (CE),
and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE).18,19 PIMs are highly
abundant glycolipids20 conserved across
all mycobacterial species; they are synthesized by mannosyltransferases
from phosphatidylinositols (PI) by substitutions with up to six mannose
sugars.18 The core of the PIM family is
a mannosyl-phosphatidyl-myo-inositol anchor (MPI) with four potential
acylation sites: positions 1 and 2 of the glycerol moiety are linked
to palmitic acid and tuberculostearic acid (TBSA) residues (10-methyloctadecanoate,
C19); at position 3 of the myo-inositol and position 6 of the mannosyl
units, either two palmitic acids or one palmitic acid and one tuberculostearic
acid are found.21,22 Position 6 of the inositol of
the anchor MPI carries a chain of one to five mannose units attached
to α-(1→6) and α-(1→2). PIMs are known to
induce chemokine and pro-inflammatory-cytokine production from mononuclear
cells through pattern-recognition receptors such as TLR-2.23,24

In this study, we applied high-mass-resolution MALDI-MSI to
visualize
PIMs and their precursor PIs (PI-TBSA) in pulmonary granulomas present
in rabbit and mouse TB-disease models. MS imaging was performed either
on the same tissue section as the histological reference stain or
on an immediately adjacent one. The validity of PIM and PI-TBSA as
spatial biomarkers of TB distribution was assessed by the coregistration
and overlay of MALDI-MSI and acid-fast-stained-tissue microscopy images.
The suitability of the MALDI-MSI approach for the simultaneous acquisition
of drug and MTB-biomarker lipids was demonstrated in negative mode
for the TB-drug rifampicin. A sequential-acquisition method was developed
for the visualization of the TB-biomarker lipids and positive-polarity
ionizing drugs in the same tissue section and was demonstrated for
the drug moxifloxacin.

Experimental
Section
Rabbit
Experiments
All animal studies were performed in biosafety-level-3
facilities and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of the New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, Newark, NJ.
Female New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits (Millbrook Farm, Concord, MA)
weighing 2.2 to 2.6 kg were maintained under specific-pathogen-free
conditions and fed water and chow ad libitum. The rabbits were infected
with M. tuberculosis HN878 using a nose-only aerosol-exposure
system as described previously.25 At 3
h postinfection, one rabbit from each round of infection was sacrificed
to determine the bacterial load implanted in the lungs. At defined
time points from 16 to 21 weeks postinfection, the rabbits received
a single dose of 30 mg/kg rifampicin (RIF) formulated in 40% sucrose
by oral gavage, seven daily doses of 30 mg/kg RIF to reach steady
state, or a single dose of 100 mg/kg moxifloxacin (MXF). RIF-dosed
rabbits were analyzed 6 h after the final drug dose. MXF-dosed rabbits
were analyzed 12 h after the final dose. An overview of all the animals
and drug-treatment schedules is shown in Table S1.

Lesion
Dissection and Processing
The right and left lungs were removed
and weighed for analytical drug measurement and histopathology. From
each lung lobe, individual granulomas and uninvolved (nondiseased)
lung-tissue sections were dissected, sized, weighed, and recorded.
The lesions collected for MALDI-MS imaging were left embedded in the
surrounding tissue and snap-frozen in liquid-nitrogen vapor as described
previously.8

Mouse
Experiments
Female specific-pathogen-free BALB/c and C3HeB/FeJ
mice aged 8–10 weeks were purchased from Charles River Laboratories
(Wilmington, MA) and Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME), respectively.
The mice were housed in a biosafety-level-3 animal facility and maintained
with sterile bedding, water, and mouse chow. Their specific-pathogen-free
status was verified by testing sentinel mice housed within the colony.
This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations
in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National
Institutes of Health. The animal protocols involving mice were approved
by Colorado State University’s Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee under protocol number 14-5262A.

The M.
tuberculosis Erdman strain (TMCC 107) was used for aerosol
infections of the mice, and the inocula were prepared as previously
described.26 Briefly, the bacteria were
originally grown as a pellicle to generate low-passage seed lots.
Working stocks were generated by growing to mid log phase in Proskauer–Beck
medium containing 0.05% Tween 80 (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis,
MO) in three passages, enumerated by colony counting on 7H11 agar
plates, divided into 1.5 mL aliquots, and stored at −70 °C
until use. C3HeB/FeJ mice were exposed to an LDA infection using a
Glas-Col inhalation-exposure system as previously described,27 resulting in an average of 75 bacteria in the
lungs on the day of exposure. Five mice were sacrificed the following
day to determine the number of colony-forming units implanted in the
lungs. Approximately 10 weeks postinfection, large caseating granulomas
(type I lesions)15 and the surrounding
uninvolved lung tissue were excised, frozen in liquid-nitrogen vapor
over a Styrofoam cooler, placed in a clear tissue tray, wrapped in
tinfoil, and immediately transferred to a dry-ice-containing cooler
prior to storage at −80 °C. The samples were shipped frozen
from Colorado State University to Rutgers for further analysis. An
overview of all the animals and drug-treatment schedules is shown
in Table S1.

MALDI-MS
Analysis of Whole Bacteria
Samples were prepared following
the protocol developed by Larrouy-Maumus et al.28 In brief, bacteria grown in a media solution were heat-killed
at 80 °C for 30 min, spun down at 2500 rpm for 10 min, and resuspended
in distilled water at an approximate concentration of 108 cells per milliliter. A diaminonaphthalene (DAN, Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) matrix was prepared at 5 mg/mL in acetone/water (7:3).
The bacteria solution (1 μL) and the matrix solution (1 μL)
were deposited on the target, mixed by multiple aspiration and deposition
cycles with a micropipette, and allowed to air-dry for 10 min.

Sample
Preparation for MALDI-MSI Analysis
Tissue sections (12 μm)
were cut from gamma-irradiated rabbit-lung-biopsy specimens using
a Leica CM1850 cryostat (Walldorf, Germany) and thaw-mounted onto
stainless steel slides for MALDI mass-spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI)
or standard glass microscope slides for hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E)
staining, Ziehl–Neelsen (ZN) staining, and MALDI-MSI.

For the MALDI-MSI analysis of the rifampicin- and moxifloxacin-treated
tissues, approximately 2 mL of 50% methanol containing 3 pmol/μL
RIF-D3 or 3 pmol/μL MXF-D4 (TRC, Toronto, Canada) was applied
to the tissues via a TM-Sprayer automated MALDI tissue-prep device
(HTX Technologies, Chapel Hill, NC) under the following optimized
conditions: a 0.05 mL/min flow rate, a 60 °C nozzle temperature,
and a 1.3 mm/s raster speed with 20 passes over the tissue. The MXF-dosed
tissues were then coated with 20 passes of a 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic
acid (DHB) matrix (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 25 mg/mL in 50% methanol
and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The rifampicin-dosed tissues were coated
with 20 passes of a 2′,4′,6′-trihydroxyacetophenone
(THAP) matrix (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 20 mg/mL in 50% methanol.

MALDI
Acquisition
MALDI-MSI acquisition was performed using a MALDI
LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen,
Germany) with a resolution of 60 000 at m/z 400 (full width at half maximum). The imaging data were
acquired in full-scan mode to maximize sensitivity, and the drug peak
identities were confirmed by acquiring several MS/MS spectra directly
from the dosed tissues. The limits of detection (LOD) for RIF and
MXF were 410 and 200 ng/g, calculated as described previously.10 For the negative-mode analysis (for PI-TBSA,
PIM, and rifampicin), spectra were acquired across the mass range
of m/z 500–2000 with a laser
energy of 20 μJ and five shots per position (one microscan per
position). For the positive-mode analysis (for moxifloxacin), spectra
were initially acquired across the mass range of m/z 200–600 with a laser energy of 12 μJ
and 10 shots per position. The laser step size was set at 50 μm,
and the total analysis time for each tissue section was between 9
and 22 h. The tissue section was rinsed of the DHB matrix by submersion
in 30% methanol for 1 s. A 1,5-diaminonaphthalene (DAN) matrix (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO) was applied, and spectra were acquired in negative
polarity across the mass range of m/z 500–2000 with a laser energy of 20 μJ and five shots
per position (one microscan per position).

2D ion images were
generated using Thermo ImageQuest software (v1.01). Normalized ion
images of RIF were generated by dividing the RIF [M – H]− signal (m/z 821.397
± 0.003) by the RIF-D3 [M – H]− signal
(m/z 824.416 ± 0.003). Normalized
ion images of MXF were generated by dividing the MXF [M + H]+ signal (m/z 402.182 ± 0.003)
by the MXF-D3 [M + H]+ signal (m/z 405.201 ± 0.003).

Coregistration
of MALDI-MS Images and Histology
Following the acquisition
of the MALDI image, the matrix was washed from the tissue surface
by immersing the slide for 10 s into a bath of 50% methanol. The tissue
was then fixed by immersion for 1h in a bath of PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde
prior to H&E staining. The stained tissue section was scanned
using a Panoramic Desk slide scanner (3D Histech), and the full-resolution
image was loaded into Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Adobe Systems, San Jose,
CA). To align the H&E image and the MALDI image, the ion map of m/z 542.970 was used. This matrix-related
ion was highly abundant outside the tissue and revealed the contours
of the tissue border and hollow bronchioles within. The MALDI image
was rescaled and aligned with the tissue using the contour and holes
as guides. A green heat map of the Ac1PIM2 [M
– H]− image at m/z 1413.902 was generated by Thermo ImageQuest and loaded
into Adobe Photoshop CS6. The PIM image was aligned with the tissue-marker
image (m/z 542.970), and a
direct-overlay image was produced. To finish the alignment, the PIM
image was treated with the Photoshop blending option (function “Linear
Dodge (add)”), and the opacity was reduced to 70% to enable
clear visualization of the bacteria.

Results
and Discussion
Detection
of Mycobacterial Biomarkers in Necrotic Lesions by MALDI-MSI
The extraction and MALDI-MS analysis of mycobacterial lipids from
intact cultures of inactivated MTB has been previously demonstrated
by Larrouy-Maumus et al.,28 who identified
specific fingerprints for multiple mycobacteria species. Of the identified
mycobacteria-specific lipids, PIMs were highly abundant, particularly
within M. tuberculosis strains. We applied the same
approach using a DAN matrix in negative mode to analyze PIMs within
MTB cultures. All major PIM and acylated PIM (acPIM) species were
detected (Figure 1A)
as well as a phosphatidyl inositol precursor lipid composed of a tuberculostearic
acid–palmitic acid chain (PI-TBSA). Next, we applied an automated-spray
matrix-deposition approach to determine whether these species could
be directly detected by MALDI-MS in necrotic, granuloma-containing
tissue sections that had been previously demonstrated by ZN staining
as containing high numbers of bacteria (Figure 1C,D). When acquiring spectra directly from
the necrotic center of the granuloma, PI-TBSA (m/z 851.57) and five intact PIM species were detected: PIM2 (m/z 1175.69), Ac1PIM2 (m/z 1413.92),
Ac1PIM6 (m/z 2062.13), Ac2PIM2 (m/z 1694.19), and Ac2PIM6 (m/z 2342.42, Figure 1E). The PIM profile matched the one obtained from the
intact mycobacteria. MALDI-MS/MS analysis was conducted on each of
the putatively identified PI and PIM peaks to confirm their identities.
The product-ion spectrum from the MS/MS analysis of the ion at m/z 1413.92, putatively identified as Ac1PIM2, is shown in Figure 1G. Fragmentation of this ion revealed the
loss of a palmitate (−C16, m/z 1157.53) or a tuberculostearate (−C19, m/z 1115.55), the loss of both a C16 and a C19 (m/z 859.34), or the loss of a fatty acid
and a glycerol (m/z 803.36). This
fragmentation profile of Ac1PIM2 matched the
ones previously published,29,30 and subsequent MS/MS
analyses of the of other identified PIMs were also in agreement with
the published examples (data not shown). The ability to detect and
identify PIM lipids directly from MTB-infected tissue sections by
MALDI-MS facilitated the application of MALDI mass-spectrometry imaging
(MALDI-MSI) for the visualization of bacterial distributions.

PIM Distribution
Detected by MALDI-MSI Colocalizes with Bacteria
Cavitation
is the most advanced stage of granuloma development and occurs when
the caseous center liquefies and drains into the airways. Cavitating
lesions have been shown to have high bacillary burdens and to facilitate
the dissemination of the infecting bacilli from the granuloma via
the airways to the external environment.31,32 An image of an H&E-stained large cavitating rabbit lesion is
shown in Figure 2A,
in which a central cavity is surrounded by liquefying caseum. MTB-antibody-labeling
of the bacteria and confocal microscopy in an adjacent tissue section
(performed as described previously),14 revealed
an intense, crescent-shaped band of bacteria immediately surrounding
the cavity void (Figure 2B). This distribution of bacteria was further verified by the ZN-staining
of a serial section (Figure 2C–E). Although the ZN-staining of the 12 μm thick
frozen tissue sections resulted in multiple artifacts (observed as
purple stripes in Figure 2C), rod-shaped MTB could be clearly visualized when viewed
at a high magnification (Figure 2D,E). The distribution of the acid-fast-stained MTB
within the lesion was highly heterogeneous, with areas containing
high bacterial counts (Figure 2D) and sparse areas with few or no bacteria present (Figure 2E). After careful
analysis of the ZN-stained granuloma section, areas containing high
bacterial populations were outlined in red (Figure 2F), and the overall distribution of the ZN-stained
bacteria matched that of the antibody-labeled confocal image shown
in Figure 2B.

closely correlate to the distribution of antigen 85 in (B). (J) RGB
overlay of the three biomarker images shown in G–I. All three
markers colocalize.

The distributions of
PI-TBSA and multiple PIM species were determined
by MALDI-MS-imaging analysis of serial sections from the same granuloma
biopsy. Ion maps for PI-TBSA, Ac1PIM2, and Ac2PIM2 are shown in Figure 2 G–I, respectively. All three lipids
shared the same crescent-shaped distribution surrounding the cavity
(as evidenced by the composite overlay of all three ion maps shown
in Figure 2J), directly
matching the distribution of bacteria visualized by antibody-labeling
(Figure 2B) and ZN
staining (Figure 2C–E).
The precise colocalization of the PIM lipids with the bacteria indicate
they are not secreted or circulate at detectable concentrations throughout
the lesion and highlight their suitability as visual biomarkers of
mycobacteria when analyzed by MALDI-MSI.

Heterogeneous
Distribution of PIM Species Observed in a Necrotic Mouse Model
Although no differences in individual-PIM-species distributions were
noted in the MALDI-MS imaging of the rabbit-lesion biopsies, differential
distributions of PIM species within a single necrotic mouse lesions
was observed.

The C3HeB/FeJ (also called “Kramnik”)
mouse model of pulmonary TB infection has been developed as a model
for assessing antituberculosis-drug efficacy.33 This model results in the production of three distinct pulmonary-lesion
types, classified as type I, type II, and type III.15 Type I lesions most closely resemble classical human TB
granulomas in that they develop fibrous encapsulated lung lesions
with central liquefactive necrosis and abundant extracellular bacilli
throughout. They comprise four distinct layers: a homogeneous, neutrophil-derived
necrotic core; a dense ring of intact neutrophils surrounding the
necrotic core; a thinner band of foamy (lipid-dense) macrophages;
and an outermost cellular rim.

MALDI-MSI was performed on tissue
sections from mouse lung lobes
containing multiple type I lesions, and the distributions of PI-TBSA,
Ac1PIM2, and Ac2PIM2 were
plotted (Figures 3A
and S1). The same tissue sections were
washed to remove the matrix and stained with H&E. Intense PI-TBSA
and Ac1PIM2 signals were detected throughout
the necrotic cores of the three type I granulomas shown in Figure 3A. However, the Ac2PIM2 signal was observed as an outer rim at the
edge of the necrotic lesion, colocalizing with the outer layer of
foamy macrophages, and an inner circle, colocalizing with caseum.
Little to no Ac2PIM2 signal was detected in
the neutrophil-dense ring between the foamy macrophages and the inner
caseum, in direct contrast to the Ac1PIM2 and
PI-TBSA signals (visualized in the magnified composite overlay in Figure 3B). This interesting
finding suggests either a difference in the type of PIM produced by
the bacteria located within the neutrophil-rich region or differential
host-cell processing of bacterial lipids within different granuloma-cell
types.34,35

caseum edge. (B) Magnified regions of the MALDI-MS images and H&E
overlays as indicated by the black box in (A). Note the absence of
Ac2PIM2 signal within the neutrophilic ring

Spatial
and Sensitivity Limitations
In order to assess the MALDI-MSI
technique for the direct visualization of mycobacteria in tissue,
it was important to evaluate the sensitivity and spatial capabilities
of the approach. The commercial Orbitrap MALDI source used a laser
with an approximate laser-spot diameter of 50 μm; therefore,
all the tissue imaging was performed using a raster-step size of 50
μm. Because of the small size of the bacteria (2–4 μm
in length), multiple bacteria would potentially be sampled in each
acquisition.

In addition to the large necrotic type I granulomas,
the C3HeB/FeJ mouse model produces abundant type III lesions with
small foci primarily consisting of macrophages and lymphocytes and
containing foamy macrophages encompassing high numbers of bacilli.15 This morphology made this kind of lesion an
ideal candidate tissue for assessing the ability of the MALDI-MSI
method to spatially resolve tissue areas containing high bacillary
load from areas with few or no bacteria present.

Using the same
mouse model shown in Figure 3, we performed a MALDI-MSI analysis on tissue
sections mounted on glass microscope slides, taking the same or a
subsequent tissue section for H&E histology staining (Figure 4A,B). As individual
PIM species were shown to have differential distributions in bacterial
populations within single mouse granulomas, bacteria in which a single
PIM species is absent or below the MALDI-MSI LOD will not be detected.
Hence, we summed the ion intensities from multiple PIM and PI-TBSA
species to maximize coverage. The summed ion image of PI-TBSA, Ac1PIM2, and Ac2PIM2 is shown
in Figure 4C. The individual
ion images are shown in Figure S2. ZN-staining
was conducted on the same tissue section to visualize MTB (Figure 4B), and the MS image
was coregistered and overlaid on this image (Figure 4D). Small pockets of PIM signal are observed
heterogeneously distributed throughout the type III lesions. Upon
further magnification of the images, clear clusters of bacteria are
present (Figure 4E,G),
which correspond to the summed ion image of PI-TBSA and PIM (Figure 4F,H). Because of
the high mass-resolving capabilities of the Orbitrap detector and
the absence of isobaric endogenous peaks, false-positive pixels were
not detected outside of the bacterial clusters. The limit of detection
appeared to be approximately 5–10 bacteria per 50 μm2 pixel, as PIM signals could not be reproducibly detected
in pixels containing fewer than 5–10 bacilli. However, the
LOD is dependent upon the sufficient extraction of PI-TBSA or PIM,
and this extraction efficiency may differ between the bacteria present
in the acellular caseum and the intracellular bacteria residing within
the macrophages.

Simultaneous
and Sequential Imaging of Bacterial Distribution and Drug Penetration
by MALDI-MSI
One of the driving factors in an effective anti-TB
drug therapy is the adequate penetration of the drug into all areas
of the granuloma at sterilizing concentrations (particularly the bacteria-rich
caseum). We evaluated the suitability of PIM lipids as bacterial biomarkers
for drug-distribution colocalization. Anti-TB drugs ionize in positive
or negative mode, depending upon the specific physicochemical properties
of the drug, whereas PI-TBSA and PIMs preferentially ionize in negative
mode. Hence, negative-mode-ionizing TB drugs have the potential to
be imaged in the same analytical run as PI-TBSA and PIMs, whereas
positive-ionizing TB drugs would have to be acquired during a prior
or subsequent analysis of the same tissue section. Additionally, most
anti-TB drugs have molecular weights under 850 Da, but the most abundant
PIM species (Ac1PIM2, Ac2PIM2, and Ac1PIM6) have molecular weights
above 1400 Da. Widening the scan range may result in reduced sensitivity
of drug analysis due to the saturation of the orbitrap with highly
abundant endogenous molecules (lipids, peptides, and salts). Hence,
PI-TBSA was selected as the optimum biomarker for bacterial imaging
because of its highly abundant signal and its molecular weight falling
within the typical drug-acquisition mass-scan range. As the individual
PIM and PI-TBSA species within the rabbit-granuloma bacteria were
colocalized, it was unnecessary to sum the ion intensities from multiple
PIM species, as previously demonstrated in the mouse model.

For positive-mode-ionizing TB drugs, a two-step approach was developed,
in which the drug was first analyzed in positive mode by MALDI-MS
imaging of a tissue section coated by the automated deposition of
a DHB matrix. After imaging, a methanol/water washing step removed
the matrix. DAN matrix was then applied, and the same tissue section
was reanalyzed by MALDI-MSI in negative mode. Examples of this approach
for rifampicin (negative mode) and moxifloxacin (positive mode) are
shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Colocalization
of TB drugs with the MTB biomarker (PI-TBSA). (A)
H&E reference and MALDI-MS images of PI-TBSA and rifampicin (RIF)
distribution in lung granulomas from a rabbit administered a single
drug dose. RIF signal is not detected in the bacteria-dense necrotic
core. (B) H&E reference and MALDI-MS images of PI-TBSA and RIF
in lung granulomas from a rabbit administered RIF at steady state
for 7 days. Two large cavities are present, and the drug is observed
throughout the tissue, including in the bacteria-dense caseum surrounding
the open cavity. (C) H&E reference and MALDI-MS images of PI-TBSA
and moxifloxacin (MXF) from a rabbit administered a single dose. The
drug signal is most abundant within the cellular rim with limited
penetration into the necrotic core in which the MTB biomarker is located.

Six hours after a single dose
of rifampicin, the drug was localized
throughout the uninvolved lung tissue and cellular-lesion areas (Figure 5A). Low rifampicin
signal was observed at the edge of the caseum; however, the drug was
not detected within the central caseum in which a high PI-TBSA signal
was observed, as is clear in the composite overlay image. After a
steady-state dosing for 7 days, rifampicin was distributed throughout
the entire biopsy, with full penetration into the bacteria-rich caseum
(Figure 5B). This distribution
pattern was in agreement with our previously published clinical data,
in which rifampicin was shown to penetrate and accumulate within caseums
at steady state.10

Moxifloxacin was
observed to be primarily localized in the cellular
rim of the necrotic granuloma 12 h after a single oral dose, with
limited penetration into the center of the caseum (Figure 5C). PI-TBSA was heterogeneously
distributed within the caseous granuloma center, and there was no
evidence of delocalization by the methanol/water washing step that
removed the DAN matrix (Figures 5C and S3). The overlay image
clearly shows the value of this approach in evaluating the abilities
of drugs to reach populations of bacteria within granulomas. However,
the data must be interpreted with caution, as the limit of detection
(LOD) of the MALDI-MSI technology may be higher than the concentration
of the drug required for bactericidal activity.

Conclusion
We have developed a label-free MALDI-MSI method for the direct
visualization of mycobacteria within thin tissue sections from TB-infected
animal models. Although the MALDI-MSI method is not proposed as a
replacement for traditional staining and microscopy methods, it offers
unique complementary information, such as the ability to determine
the distributions of individual lipid components of the mycobacterial
wall. This molecular specificity enabled individual PIM species and
PI-TBSA to be visualized in pulmonary granulomas from both rabbit
and mouse models of active TB disease. Contrasting distributions of
individual PIM lipids were observed inside morphologically distinct
regions of mouse granulomas, potentially indicating that the MALDI-MSI
method can resolve bacteria in different metabolic or replicative
states or stages of processing by host cells. Additionally, because
MALDI-MSI directly analyzes the lipid as opposed to a stain or label,
it will detect bacteria regardless of their metabolic states or the
intactness of their cell walls. Increases in the sensitivity and spatial-resolving
capability of the method will enable smaller populations of bacteria
to be identified at the single-host-cell level (10–40 μm2).

Most importantly, this approach also enables the
simultaneous acquisition
of ion images of drugs and pathogenic bacteria in ex vivo tissues,
providing an at-a-glance qualitative readout of whether the administered
drug is reaching its intended target.

In addition to visualizing
mycobacteria, this technique has broad
applicability to many different pathogens and disease states, with
the limiting factor that pathogen-specific lipid markers must be identifiable
and detectable.

Future work will focus on developing MALDI-MSI
methods for other
mycobacterial cell-wall lipids, including glycerophospholipids, mycolic
acids, and trehalose mycolates. As the biosynthesis of some of these
lipids is the site of action of some anti-TB drugs, such as isoniazid
(INH) and ethionamide (ETH), there is the future potential to visualize
drug-mediated lipid changes occurring directly within dosed tissues.
