Unbiased characterization
of dyes and their degradation products
in cultural-heritage objects requires an analytical method which provides
universal separation power regardless of dye classes. Dyes are small
molecules that vary widely in chemical structure and properties, which
renders their characterization by a single method challenging. We
have developed a comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography
method hyphenated with mass spectrometry and UV–vis detection.
We use stationary-phase-assisted modulation to enhance the method
in terms of detection limits and solvent compatibility and to reduce
the analysis time. The PIOTR program was used to optimize an assembly
of shifting second-dimension gradients, which resulted in a high degree
of orthogonality (80% in terms of the asterisk concept). The resulting
method is universally applicable to all classes of dyes extracted
from cultural-heritage objects. Thanks to the high peak capacity and
orthogonality, dye components can be separated from chemically similar
impurities and degradation products, providing a detailed fingerprint
of the dyes mixture in a specific sample. The method was applied to
a number of challenging dye extracts from 17th- and 19th-century cultural-heritage
objects.

==== Body
Throughout
the history of humanity,
dyes and pigments have been widely used.1,2 Pigments have
been used at least since the Paleolithic period, as is evident from
the findings of red-ocher-dyed corpses dating back to the Upper Paleolithic
age, around 30 000 B.C.3 The oldest
dyed cloth ever found dates back to around 4000 B.C. and was discovered
in the Indus Valley in South Asia.1 Natural
dyes have been employed predominantly throughout time until the first
synthetic dye, mauveine, was discovered in 1856.4 In the following years, the dyes industry developed dramatically,
and synthetic dyes gained popularity due to their ease of production
and overall better lightfastness.5

Dyes and dyestuff samples pose significant challenges when it comes
to their analysis, due to a number of reasons. Historically, dyes
were typically prepared with the goal to obtain, often brilliant,
colors without paying attention to the purity of the compounds. Dyestuffs
may thus contain a large number of side products. In objects dyed
with natural dyes, several components are usually present, and the
combination of these components is used to identify the biological
source.6,7 Also when synthetic dyes were used, complex
mixtures of very similar components are often found, all contributing
to the color.8

Dyes and their side
products are also prone to degradation in time
or by exposure to air, light, and/or humidity. Furthermore, all the
dye components and degradation products may interact with each other
and/or with the material to which they are applied. Considering that
one object may be colored with a number of dyes, a single art object
can give rise to 10–20 different samples, each one containing
10–20 dye-related compounds.9

Dyes can be classified in a large number of categories, including
mordant, direct, acidic, basic, and vat dyes.1 Typical LC methods for dye characterization allow analysis of a
limited subset of these classes.8,10 In addition, while
consultation of historical documents may provide conservation scientists
with clues on possibly applied dyestuffs in a given object, unequivocal
historical analysis is usually not possible, and a universal analytical
method is required.

Ideally, an analytical technique is (i)
unbiased with regard to
pre-existing knowledge on a given cultural-heritage object; (ii) universal
for as many classes of dyes extracted from cultural-heritage objects
as possible; (iii) offers sufficient selectivity to analyze degradation
products that can be chemically similar to the main compound, regardless
of dye class; and (iv) provides a high separation power (chromatographic
efficiency in both dimensions) and a high precision (repeatability),
to ensure reliable identification of dyes present. The above premises
demand a high selectivity and separation power of the analytical technique.
A conventional (one-dimensional) LC-MS method may suffice to identify
the dyes used. However, our goal is to also study the nature and (approximate)
concentrations of dye-degradation products, so as to determine the
condition of cultural-heritage objects and to support the development
of conservation strategies. Because a single dye compound may give
rise to 30–40 degradation products11 that occur in vastly different concentrations, we need a separation
technique with a very much higher separation power, such as LC ×
LC.

In this context, we recently developed a separation method
based
on comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC ×
LC) for the simultaneous analysis of synthetic acidic and basic dyes.9 In LC × LC, the first-dimension (1D) effluent is divided in many fractions by a modulation interface,
and each fraction is injected into a second-dimension (2D) separation. The total peak capacity is approximately equal to
the product of the individual peak capacities of the respective separation
dimensions. If two sufficiently different (so-called “orthogonal”)
separation mechanisms are used, this total peak capacity can be fully
exploited. Our method therefore utilized a strong anion-exchange mechanism
in the 1D separation (separation based on charge) and a
fast ion-pair reversed-phase LC separation in the 2D separation
(separation based on hydrophobicity).

While successful at the
separation of dyes, acidic and basic dyes,
the previous method showed insufficient separation for other dye classes.
In the present work, we aimed to extend the method to other dye classes,
including the natural dyes. Moreover, the ion-pair agent in the 2D separation, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, proved to be
incompatible with mass spectrometry. Other drawbacks of the previous
LC × LC method were (i) high detection limits, due to the additional
dilution of the sample mixture by the 2D separation; (ii)
the occurrence of “breakthrough” (premature elution
of sample components from the 2D column), due to incompatibility
of the 1D-effluent and the 2D phase system;
and (iii) a rather long analysis time of 4 h. All of these issues
may be addressed using active-modulation techniques.12

In this work, we present a method for the characterization
of natural
and synthetic dyes by LC × LC with UV/vis and mass-spectrometric
(MS) detection. The method is universally applicable to all types
of dyes extracted from cultural-heritage objects. We have developed
a stationary-phase assisted modulation (SPAM) interface to overcome
incompatibility issues between the two dimensions, to enhance detection
sensitivity and to reduce the analysis time. Shifted-gradient assemblies
are explored to maximize the orthogonality of the two separation dimensions.
The target application of the universal method is the detailed characterization
of dyes, contaminants, and degradation products found in cultural-heritage.
To demonstrate the potential of the technique, dye analysis is performed
on a selection of 17th- and 19th-century historical objects.

Experimental
Section
Hardware
Instruments
For all experiments,
an Agilent (Waldbronn,
Germany) 1290 series Infinity 2D-LC system was used for liquid chromatography
and UV–vis detection. The system included two binary pumps
(G4220A); one 1200 series isocratic pump (G1310A); a 1290 series autosampler
(G4226A) equipped with a 20-μL injection loop; two thermostated
column compartments (G1316C), in one of which an 8-port, 2-position
2D-LC valve was installed (G4236A); and one diode-array detector (DAD,
G4212A) equipped with an Agilent Max-Light Cartridge Cell (G4212-60008,
10 mm path length, Vdet = 1.0 μL).
The injector needle drew and ejected at a speed of 10 μL·min–1, with a two second equilibration time. All tubing
was fabricated of stainless steel (SS). The chromatographic and UV–vis
systems were controlled using Agilent OpenLAB CDS Chemstation Edition
(Rev. C.01.04 [35]) software. For MS detection, a Bruker (Bremen,
Germany) MicroQ-ToF mass spectrometer was used. The mass spectrometer
was controlled by Bruker Daltonics micrOTOF control Compass 1.3 for
micrOTOF-sr1 version 2.0 on a separate computer. Data were extracted
using Bruker Daltonics Data Analysis, version 4.0 SP4 build 281.

Columns
For the first dimension, an Agilent PL-SAX
1000 Å (PL1951-3802, 150 × 2.1 mm i.d., dp = 8 μm, max ΔP = 150 bar)
strong anion-exchange column was used. To protect the 1D column, an Agilent 1290 Infinity In-Line Filter (G5067-4638) was
used. For the second dimension, an Agilent ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18
Rapid Resolution HD 95 Å (959757-902, 50 × 2.1 mm i.d., dp = 1.8 μm, max ΔP = 1200 bar) column was used.

Trapping: SPAM
For trapping, two Phenomenex SecurityGuard
ULTRA (P/N: AJ0-9000) guard-column holders were used in conjunction
with two UHPLC C18 2.1 mm i.d. SecurityGuard ULTRA cartridges (P/N:
AJ0-8782). Each combination of a holder and a cartridge is henceforth
referred to as a trap. For each modulation loop, one trap was directly
installed into one of the ports of the valve with the male end, and
the female end was connected to another port using an 140 mm long
SS tubing with 0.12 mm i.d.

For all actively modulated LC ×
LC experiments, the end of the 1D column was connected
through a connection-tee (P/N: U-428, IDEX, Illinois, US) with a dilution
flow of 5 mM ammonium formate/formic acid buffer (pH = 3.2) in water.
The combined flow-stream (at a ratio of 20:1, v/v, [formate buffer]/[1D column effluent]) was directly connected to the 2D-LC valve
using a Waters Zirconia 50 μL Y-mixer, P/N: 700002911, internal
volume 50 μL. Figure 1 clarifies the connections and operating principle of this
active-modulation technique.13

Chemicals
Acetonitrile (LC-MS grade)
was obtained from
Biosolve (Valkenswaard, The Netherlands), and deionized water (MS-grade)
was procured from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Acetonitrile (AR grade)
was obtained from VWR International (Fontenay-sous-Bois, France).
Triethylamine (≥99.5%), tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrochloride
(≥99.0%) and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (≥99.9%),
ammonium sulfate (BioXtra, ≥ 99%), ammonium formate (BioUltra,
≥ 99%), sodium chloride (BioXtra, ≥ 99.5%), dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO, ≥ 99%), and formic acid (≥96%) were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany). Eighty different
dyestuffs and the extracts of the samples from historical objects
were obtained from the Cultural Heritage Agency of The Netherlands
(RCE, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).

Sample 1 was an extract from
a textile found in a 17th-century shipwreck located in the Waddenzee
in The Netherlands. The textile was remarkably well preserved for
a 400-year-old object, rendering it very useful for studies as to
their creation. The other three samples were extracts from embroideries
designed by Emile Bernard. Sample 2 was from Plant and flowers
on gray fond and dates from 1892 to 1904, and samples 3 and
4 were extracts from different sections of Plant and flowers
on yellow fond, dating from 1891 to 1892. Readers seeking
more information on these historical samples and the applied extraction
procedure are referred to in the Supporting Information, section S-1.

Analytical Conditions
Preparation Methods
The original dyestuffs provided
by the RCE were supplied as powdered pigments, which contained the
dyestuff, but also degradation products, impurities, mordants, and
other materials. Each sample was diluted into a stock solution, in
concentrations of 5000 ppm by weight, in a mixture of ACN and DMSO
1:1 (v/v). For the analyses, these were further diluted to a concentration
of 50–100 ppm, in the same solvent mixture.

A mixture
of all dyestuffs in the set was also created by mixing all the 5000-ppm
stock solutions in equal ratio. The result is a solution which contains
all the 80 dyes, their contaminants, and degradation products, in
a concentration of approximately 60 ppm for each dye.

Methods
This section describes the general method with
standard parameters used in this study unless otherwise specified
in the text.

For the 1D strong-anion-exchange separation,
the flow rate was set at 60 μL·min–1.
Both mobile phases consisted of 5 mM TRIS buffer, pH = 7.5, in water/acetonitrile
(6:4, v/v) without (mobile phase A) or with (mobile phase B) 100 mM
ammonium sulfate. The gradient program was 100% A from 0.0 to 7.5
min, a linear gradient from 100% A to 100% B from 7.5 to 45.0 min,
maintained at 100% B from 45.0 to 55.0 min, and a linear gradient
from 100% B to 100% A from 55.0 to 60.0 min.

The dilution flow
was set at 1.14 mL·min–1 to achieve a ratio
of 20:1 (v/v) relative to the 1D effluent.

For the 2D ion-pair reversed-phase LC separation, the
run time (equal to the modulation time) was 0.75 min, and the flow
rate was 1.2 mL·min–1. The mobile phase consisted
of a 5 mM triethylamine (TEA) buffer, brought to pH = 3.0 with formic
acid, and acetonitrile (ACN) in a ratio of 95:5 TEA buffer/ACN (v/v,
mobile phase A) and 5:95 TEA buffer/ACN (v/v, mobile phase B). A shifting
gradient assembly for the second dimension was optimized using PIOTR.14,15 In a shifting gradient, the initial modifier concentration (ϕinit) and final modifier concentration (ϕfinal) were varied across 2D modulations as a function of the
(1D) analysis time (1t). The
functions of ϕinit(1t) and ϕfinal(1t) can
be represented as boundaries in between which the 2D gradients
are operated. For every modulation, the 2D gradient program
was a linear gradient from ϕinit(1t) at 2t = 0 min to ϕfinal(1t) at 2t = 0.4 min, maintained at ϕfinal(1t) from 2t =
0.4 to 0.55 min, a linear gradient from ϕfinal(1t) at 2t = 0.55
min to ϕinit(1t) at 2t = 0.6 min maintaining at ϕinit(1t) until 0.75 min. The optimized lower
boundary function ϕinit(1t) started at 30% B from 0 until 10.0 min, then decreased linearly
from 30% B to 20% B from 10.0 to 40.0 min, and maintained at 20% B
from 40.0 to 60.0 min. The optimized upper boundary function ϕfinal(1t) started at 100% B from
0.0 to 10.0 min, then decreased linearly from 100% B to 65% B from
10 to 50 min, and then decreased linearly from 65 to 55% from 50 to
60 min.

Data Analysis
All data and displayed images were processed
and created using the in-house written PIOTR program.14

Results and Discussion
Development and Optimization
of Analytical Method
While
the previously developed method featured a good identification power
for synthetic dyes, a number of fundamental and practical complications
limited its applicability. These limitations included (i) concerns
about quantification, due to the additional dilution by the second-dimension
separation, which reduced the detection limits of the method; (ii)
the occurrence of breakthrough in the 2D separation; (iii)
the rather long analysis time; (iv) the limited surface coverage,
rendering a fraction of the theoretical peak capacity useless; (v)
the incompatibility with the MS, due to the ion-pairing agent in the
second-dimension mobile phase; and (vi) the lack of universality of
the method (not covering natural dyes and neutral synthetic dyes).

Improvement of Detection Limits, Phase-System Compatibility,
and Speed of Analysis
While the added second-separation dimension
yields additional selectivity and separation power, it also further
dilutes the analytes. Active-modulation techniques, such as stationary-phase-assisted
modulation, can potentially alleviate this problem. In this case,
each sampling loop of the 2D-LC valve is replaced by a
small trapping unit (“trap”), typically a guard column.
As the 1D effluent passes through the trap, analytes must
be retained by the stationary phase. Often an additional dilution
flow is utilized to establish conditions under which the analytes
can be sufficiently retained. Once the modulation cycle is complete
(i.e., the 2D system is ready for the next injection),
the valve switches, and the trap is brought in-line before the 2D column, while the other trap is brought in-line after the 1D column. The 2D mobile phase (composition–gradient
program) is then used to elute the retained analytes into the 2D column.

For this study, a 1D flow rate
of 60 μL·min–1 was used in conjunction
with a dilution flow of 5 mM ammonium formate/formic acid buffer (pH
= 3.2) in water at 1.140 mL·min–1 to achieve
an effective dilution ratio of 1:20 (v/v). Other dilution ratios were
also investigated, and the results are shown in the Supporting Information, section S-2. A low pH was used to
neutralize any organic acids. One of the diode-array detectors was
used to monitor the waste stream from the 2D-LC valve to
verify the absence of premature elution from the traps.

The
dead volume of active-modulation traps typically is in the
order of a few microliters, and the little tubing required merely
serves to connect the trap to the valves. Consequently, most of the 1D mobile phase is discarded, which effectively increases the
concentration of the analyte bands in the trap, eventually improving
the detection limits. Moreover, the absence of 1D mobile
phase during the release of analytes from the trap diminishes the
risk of breakthrough resulting from solvent incompatibility. Moreover,
as the full volume of the fractioned 1D effluent must no
longer be transferred to the second dimension, the 1D flow
rate can be increased, which may result in a shorter analysis time,
provided that undersampling16 of the first
dimension is avoided. Finally, a smaller 2D injection volume
may result in a better separation efficiency and a higher peak capacity.16

Improvement of MS Compatibility and Separation-Space
Coverage
As a result of the reduced volume of the collected 1D fraction, the 2D injection volume is significantly
decreased.
Consequently, shorter and narrower columns can be used, leading to
a lower 2D flow rate and allowing more (or all) of the 2D effluent to be directed to, for example, a mass spectrometer
with a flow-rate restriction (e.g., micro- or nanoelectrospray). To
exploit this fully, the previously employed ion-pairing agent, tetramethylammonium
hydroxide, was replaced by the reasonably volatile triethylamine in
the 2D mobile phase, while the pH was kept at 3.0.

By increasing the 1D and 2D flow rates, the
modulation and analysis times of the method could be reduced from
1.0 and 90 min (Supporting Information, section S-3, Figure S3A) to 0.5 and 45 min (Supporting Information, section S-3, Figure S3B), respectively. However,
the narrow peaks observed in the 2D separation proved challenging
for the specific MS instrument used. To sample each chromatographic
peak sufficiently, while maintaining sufficient sensitivity, a sampling
rate of 4 Hz was selected for the MS. This led to a minimum modulation
time of 0.75 min.

To improve the surface coverage, an optimal
shifting gradient assembly
was predicted using the PIOTR program according to the procedure described
elsewhere.14 The improvement resulting
from the application of this program becomes apparent from the two
chromatograms and corresponding gradient assemblies shown in Figure 2A,B. The coverage
of the separation space is improved in Figure 2A (asterisk orthogonality of 0.700 to 0.804),
thus increasing the effective peak capacity. Readers seeking more
information on general interpretation or a clarification on the appearance
of LC × LC chromatograms are referred to the Supporting Information, section S-4.

of a mixture of 80 synthetic and natural
dyes using a modulation time of 0.75 min, and two different shifting
gradient assemblies shown at the bottom. Detection wavelength shown,
254 nm.

Improvement of the Mixed-Mode 1D Separation
Originally, anion-exchange was selected
as the 1D separation
mechanism, because a large fraction of synthetic dyes contains anionic
moieties. In anion-exchange chromatography, negatively charged analytes
are retained, whereas cationic or neutral species elute early (i.e.,
effectively unretained). All of the neutral and synthetic dyes which
coelute around the dead-volume from the 1D separation then
must be separated by a fast and efficient 2D reversed-phase
separation. This is not a realistic expectation. The total number
of neutral analytes exceeds the local peak capacity of this part of
the separation space. We must remedy this if we seek extension of
the method to include neutral, hydrophobic natural dyes.

Fortunately,
some ion-exchange columns also provide retention based on hydrophobicity
under RPLC conditions. This so-called mixed-mode (ion-exchange/RPLC)
behavior offers opportunities for creating additional retention (and
increased peak capacity) for the neutral dyes. Various 1D dual-gradient programs were explored, as illustrated in Figure 3. During the ion-exchange
counterion gradient, the initial acetonitrile concentration was also
varied from 40 (Figure 3A), 30 (Figure 3B),
20 (Figure 3C), and
10% (Figure 3D) ACN
in mobile phase A to 40% ACN in mobile phase B. In essence, the two
gradients were concurrent. Unfortunately, the increase in retention,
as the initial ACN concentration is lowered, is accompanied by a deterioration
of the peak shapes. This occurred especially for weak anions, which
were found to coelute with the strongly charged anions.

Figure 3 Separation

gradient (see the Methods section) and
(A) a constant concentration of 40% ACN, or a gradient
from (B) 30 to 40%, (C) 20 to 40%, or (D) 10 to 40% of ACN. Detection
wavelength shown, 254 nm.

One possible solution was thought to have the ACN gradient
preceding
the salt gradients, instead of having them run concurrently. While 1D-LC experiments with two successive gradients were promising
(see the Supporting Information, section S-5 for chromatograms), proceeding with this approach would, however,
require a quaternary pump with a low-dwell volume, which was not available.
Further attempts to increase the retention of neutral compounds were
abandoned.

Figure 4 illustrates
the optimized LC × LC separation with almost all of the components
that give rise to significant peaks identified using the information
provided by both the MS and UV–vis detectors for each data
point (see the Supporting Information, section S-8 for a full reference database of all dyes). Both synthetic
and natural dyes are well separated, and the surface space is well
covered. In terms of the asterisk equation, the orthogonality is 0.80
(Z–, 0.94; Z1, 0.97; Z+, 0.85; and Z2, 0.82), which is very high.17 See the Supporting Information, section S-6 for a full description of the used data and a detailed
calculation. The good separation and high orthogonality contribute
to a universal applicability of the method to all dyes extracted from
cultural-heritage objects regardless of class.

The final attribute for the method
to be successful for this purpose
is a good repeatability. Retention times in both dimensions were found
to be highly repeatable. Some representative values for standard deviations
in measured retention times for the standard mixture are listed in Table 1. When an unknown
sample is injected using the universal method, any known dyes present
can be rapidly identified with a high degree of confidence, even without
the availability of MS information.18 Moreover,
LC × LC chromatograms give an instant impression of additional
dyes, related impurities, and degradation products present in the
sample.

Application
The developed universal method was applied
to the historical samples 1–4. For sample 1, the resulting
separation is shown in Figure 5A. The main components found were alizarin, carminic acid,
and purpurin. In addition, two unknown compounds were found, which
have not yet been identified. Compounds that are highly and variably
charged at the 1D mobile-phase pH of 7.5 elute as very
broad peaks from the mixed-mode ion-exchange separation. A case in
point is carminic acid (analyte #2), with pKa values of 3.39, 5.78, 8.35, 10.27, and 11.51,19 and a resulting charge close to −3 at
the 1D conditions. In the vicinity of a pKa value, different analyte ions will be differently charged.
The pKa may also vary locally, especially
in the vicinity of the stationary phase, where the solvent composition
is different. All of this contributes to very broad and poorly shaped 1D peaks. However, for identification purposes, oddly shaped
peaks are very useful, adding yet another factor to reduce the uncertainty
of peak identification. For compound #4, which could not directly
be identified, its retention times and peak shapes suggest that it
is quite similar to carminic acid.

from DAD is shown at optimal wavelengths for clarity. Identification
based on MS and UV–vis spectra.

The separation of sample 2 is shown in Figure 5B. Overall, the peak assignments clearly
show the presence of the dyestuff patent blue V as the main component.
However, thanks to the high local peak capacity of the method, compounds
that are quite similar are also separated. Multiple isomers and degradation
products of patent blue V can be discerned. This fingerprint may provide
insight in the extent of dye degradation. In addition, traces of picric
acid, water blue IN, and a number of yet unknown components were found.
The separation of sample 3, shown in Figures 5C, also reveals the presence of a large number
of unknown compounds and degradation products next to several major
dye components flavazine L, yellowish light green SF, orange II, quinoline
yellow components, and tartrazine. Sample 4 (Figure 5D) is an example of a challenging case. The
extract appears to consist of several crystal violet and patent blue
V components. However, the retention patterns of components #7–9
suggest that all of the patent blue V components have lost their charge
due to conditions encountered during the history of the cultural-heritage
object.

The universal method developed in this study opens new
avenues
for the characterization of dyes in cultural-heritage objects. Individual
samples never contain the vast numbers of dyes that may potentially
be separated (Figure 5). Instead, a typical sample contains a small number of dyes, the
most common of which can be readily identified with a good deal of
certainty. However, prior to analysis, it is not known what dyes to
expect. A universal method, as presented here, allows for the identification
of a wide variety of components from different dye classes without
changing the chromatographic system as done in the past.7,8 Dyes that are revealed using the present method but cannot currently
be identified present challenges to the art-science community and,
as such, may spur progress in the field. The new knowledge created
may provide crucial information from a historical perspective.

Typical samples also contain minor peaks, which may provide information
on the origin of the material (side products, contaminants) or on
the state of degradation (degradation products). Figure 6B provides a case in point.
The LC × LC chromatogram shows a number of neutral or positively
charged dyes that elute around t0 in the
first dimension and two highly informative sextets of peaks which
belong to differently methylated forms of the dye water blue IN. The
difference between the two sextets is one charged (sulfonate) group.
Within a sextet, a horizontal step to the left reflects the presence
of an additional polar group, and the upward shift reflects isomers.
The LC × LC chromatogram provides a great deal of instant information
on the variations encountered around the basic structure of the dye
(Supporting Information, section S-7).
When performing high-resolution 1D separations (Figure 6A), a good separation
can be obtained, but the interpretation of the chromatogram is not
straightforward and requires careful interpretation of UV/vis and
MS spectra. Also, trace compounds are revealed much more clearly in
LC × LC chromatograms.

Conclusion
The analysis of dye extracts from cultural-heritage
objects presents
a major challenge for analytical chemists. A large variety of dye
classes exist, which can feature almost all types of molecular properties
that are typically encountered in small-molecule separations. This
puts very high demands on LC separations. To fill the need for a universal
tool for the separation of dyes and their degradation products, we
have developed a highly orthogonal method based on actively modulated
comprehensive LC × LC, which provides similar separation power
regardless of dye class. We have demonstrated the method on extracts
taken from 17th- and 19th-century historical objects. The representative
separations shown indicate that the dye components in a real sample
will rarely span the entire separation space. However, the separations
also underline the benefits of high overall and local peak capacities.
Real samples typically exhibit a number of highly similar dyes, side
products, contaminants, and degradation products.

The proposed
method allows for hyphenation of LC × LC with
MS, uses stationary-phase-assisted modulation to improve detection
sensitivity and mobile-phase compatibility, and uses a computer-optimized
shifting gradient assembly to obtain a high degree of orthogonality.
Optimization of the 1D mobile-phase composition was also
attempted with an additional organic-modifier gradient preceding the
ion-exchange salt gradient. However, this was not fruitful. Good peak
shapes could not be obtained for all classes of peaks, and the mixed
retention mechanisms complicated computer-aided modeling.

Due
to the separation power offered by the method, many additional
analytes have been clearly separated and characterized by MS and UV–vis
spectra, most of which are not identified at this stage. We envisage
that the proposed method opens new possibilities to perform detailed
online dye-degradation research.
