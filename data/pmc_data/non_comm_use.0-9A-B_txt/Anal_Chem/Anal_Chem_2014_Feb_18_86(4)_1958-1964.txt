Here,
we construct an open-channel on-chip electroosmotic pump capable of
generating pressures up to ∼170 bar and flow rates up to ∼500
nL/min, adequate for high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC)
separations. A great feature of this pump is that a number of its
basic pump units can be connected in series to enhance its pumping
power; the output pressure is directly proportional to the number
of pump units connected. This additive nature is excellent and useful,
and no other pumps can work in this fashion. We demonstrate the feasibility
of using this pump to perform nanoflow HPLC separations; tryptic digests
of bovine serum albumin (BSA), transferrin factor (TF), and human
immunoglobulins (IgG) are utilized as exemplary samples. We also compare
the performance of our electroosmotic (EO)-driven HPLC with Agilent
1200 HPLC; comparable efficiencies, resolutions, and peak capacities
are obtained. Since the pump is based on electroosmosis, it has no
moving parts. The common material and process also allow this pump
to be integrated with other microfabricated functional components.
Development of this high-pressure on-chip pump will have a profound
impact on the advancement of lab-on-a-chip devices.

==== Body
The concept
of a lab-on-a-chip
(LOC) device was developed to integrate and perform multiple analytical
processes on a microchip platform.1−3 With these devices, one
can analyze samples at the point of need rather than sending the samples
to a centralized laboratory for analysis.4,5 While
a lot of progress has been made toward this goal, the most important
and ubiquitous analytical technique,6 high
performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC), has not been fully integrated
on a chip. The primary reason is the lack of a fundamental component,
a high-pressure pump that can be fabricated on a chip. A variety of
micropumps has been developed since the early 1980s.7−10 Some of the pumps can be fabricated on a chip, but these pumps cannot
generate high pumping pressures.11−13 A few other pumps can
produce high pressures,14 but fabricating
these pumps on chips is often challenging.

Among all microfabricated
pumps, the electroosmosis-based pump shows the most promise for developing
a high-pressure pump on a chip.15 Electroosmosis
is a fundamental phenomenon that was discovered in the 1800s.16 When a silica surface is in contact with an
aqueous solution, the surface becomes negatively charged due to the
deprotonation of surface silanol groups. These negative charges attract
cations, forming a positively charged solution layer very close to
the surface. As an external electric field is applied, the positively
charged ions move along the electric field and drag the bulk solution
moving with them, yielding an electroosmotic (EO) flow (see Figure 1a). Obviously, if a surface is positively charged,
the EO flow will move against the electric field. Figure 1b presents a conventional configuration of an EO
pump. Here, the pump’s output pressure equals the backpressure.
However, EO pumps in this configuration cannot generate high pressures.

Figure 1 Working
principle of pressure power supply. (a) Generation of electroosmotic
flow. (b) Configuration of a conventional electroosmotic pump. The
backpressure is exerted by an external load, and the flow profile
is a linear combination of the plug-like electroosmotic flow and the
parabolic backpressure-driven flow (see inset). (c) Fundamental unit
of a pressure power supply. The +EO pump consists of pump channels
with positively charged surfaces, while the −EO pump consists
of pump channels with negatively charged surfaces. (d) High-pressure
EO pump consisting of serially joined pressure power supplies. The
output pressure is proportional to the number of pressure power supplies
connected in series.

Figure 1c presents an innovative pump
unit that can be used to produce high pumping pressures. A unique
feature of this unit is that we can connect many of these units in
series (see Figure 1d), and the output pressure
of the assembled pump increases proportionally to the number of pump
units connected. Because this pump unit works like a voltage power
supply, we also call it (the combination of +EO pump and −EO
pump as assembled in Figure 1c) a pressure
power supply. Pumps as configured in Figure 1b cannot be connected in series, because the low voltage at the outlet
of one pump would be incompatible with the high voltage (HV) at the
inlet of another pump. In the new configuration, we take advantage
of the EO property that EO flow goes with (or against) the electric
field if the surface is negatively (or positively) charged. As we
combine a +EO pump with a −EO pump, we bring the voltage at
the outlet end to the same level as that at the inlet end, while the
EO flow moves forward smoothly. The +EO pump is defined as the EO
pump made from positively charged surfaces, and the −EO pump
is defined as the EO pump made from negatively charged surfaces. It
is this configuration that enables us to connect many pressure power
supplies in series to enhance the pump’s pressure output. The
working principle of this pump configuration has been described,17−19 but no pumps have ever been fabricated on a chip. In this work,
we develop a process to fabricate this pump on a chip, we characterize
this high-pressure on-chip pump, and we demonstrate the feasibility
of using this pump for HPLC separations. Protein tryptic digests are
used as samples for these demonstrations.

Experimental Section
Reagents
and Materials
Acetone, acetonitrile, ammonium acetate, ammonium
bicarbonate, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and [2-(methacryloyloxy)-ethyl]-trimethylammonium
chloride (META) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
Acrylamide, (3-methacryloxypropyl)-trimethoxysilane (a bifunctional
reagent), N,N′-methylene
bisacrylamide (Bis, a cross-linker), N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine
(TEMED), and ammonium persulfate (APS) were purchased from Bio-Rad
Laboratories (Hercules, CA). Microposit S1818 photoresist, MF-319
developer, Chrome etchant, and gold etchant were purchased from Shipley
Company (Marlborough, MA). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was purchased
from Fisher Scientific International INC. Trypsin was purchased
from Promega Corp (Madison, WI). Fused silica capillaries were bought
from Molex Inc. (Phoenix, AZ). All solutions were prepared with ultrapure
water purified by a NANOpure infinity ultrapure water system (Barnstead,
Newton, WA).

Microfabrication
Standard photolithographic
technologies and a two-photomask process20,21 were used to produce chips for this work. Figure 2A presents the channel pattern on a wafer; there were eight
repetitive channel groups. Figure 2B presents
an expanded view of one channel group. Forty five parallel pump channels
were joined via 12 connection channels to one or two capillary-incorporation
channels. Figure 2C presents the major steps
of the fabrication process. On a 98 mm-diameter glass wafer, ∼190
μm-deep grooves (at opposite sides of the wafer) were produced
first using one photomask containing all capillary-incorporation channels
(the photomask line width for these channels was 10 μm). Because
of the isotropic etching of HF, these grooves had a semicircular profile
with an i.d. of ∼380 μm that matched the o.d. (375 μm)
of a connection capillary nicely. A second photomask was then used
to etch the pump channels (the photomask line width for these channels
was 60 μm) and connection channels (the line width for these
channels was 200 μm) in the middle region of the wafer to a
depth of ∼800 nm. After holes were drilled through the capillary-incorporation
grooves on one wafer, it was cleaned, face-to-face aligned with another
structured wafer, and thermally bonded. Figure 2D presents the photo of a bonded EO pump chip.

image of a finished chip.

Preparation of Charged Channel Surfaces
Bare (borofloat)
glass surfaces, in conjunction with 5.0 mM ammonium acetate (pH =
7) pump solution, were used to yield negatively charged surfaces for
the −EO pumps. Because ammonium acetate was a pH buffer and
also because we used the same buffer all the time, the flow rate of
an −EO pump was pretty stable (<5% variations) during operation.
A polyelectrolyte coating process22,23 was employed
to produce positively charged surfaces. A dynamic coating solution
was first prepared by briefly degassing a 2 mL solution containing
300 μL of 75% META, 10 μL of 10% APS, 1.0 mg of Bis, 72
mg of sodium chloride, and 1.0 μL of TEMED, allowing the mixture
to polymerize at 4 °C for 2 h and terminating the reaction by
bubbling the solution with air. This reaction yielded a positively
charged polyelectrolyte solution. To prepare positively charged channel
surfaces, the surfaces were flushed with 1.0 M sodium hydroxide for
20 min, rinsed with deionized water for 10 min, reacted with the dynamic
coating solution for 2 h, and finally rinsed with 5 mM ammonium acetate
for 30 min.

Purification of Human Immunoglobulins (IgG)
The human serum was first centrifuged at 2500 rotations per minute
(rpm) for 15 min, and 3.0 mL of the serum was transferred to a 15
mL flask. After 6.0 mL of 60 mM acetate buffer (pH = 4.8) was added
in the flask, 250 μL of octanoic acid was slowly (in a dropwise
format) added to the serum while the mixture was gently stirred. After
the solution was continuously stirred for another 30 min at room temperature,
it was centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 rpm, and the supernatant was
collected. Then, 9.0 mL of saturated ammonium sulfate solution was
added into the supernatant, and the solution was allowed to stay overnight
at 4 °C. The solution was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min,
and the supernatant was discarded. About 1.0 mL of 0.15 M phosphate-buffered
saline solution was slowly added to the pellet, and the solution was
gently stirred with a pipet. The solution was dialyzed against 0.10
M phosphate buffered saline solution (600 mL) at 4 °C for ∼2
h, and this dialysis process was repeated five times.

Protein Digestion
After 0.50 mg of protein (BSA, transferrin factor (TF), or IgG)
was incubated with 15 μg of trypsin, 3.95 mg of ammonium bicarbonate,
and 500 μL of deionized water for 24 h at 37 °C, 1.5 μL
of 1.0 M hydrochloric acid was added into the solution to terminate
the digestion reaction. The solution was then centrifuged for 5 min
at 3000 rpm, and the supernatant was concentrated in a vacuum concentrator
for ∼4 h. The residual solution had a volume of ∼25
μL, and it was stored at −20 °C.

Results and Discussion
On-Chip
EO Pump
Figure 3A presents a design
concept for producing the on-chip pressure power supplies used in
this experiment. We made all +EO pumps on one chip and all −EO
pumps on another chip so that we would not contaminate the channel
surfaces of −EO pumps when coating the channel surfaces of
+EO pumps. Technically, we could integrate all EO pumps on one chip.
It should be pointed out that having an additional chip does not increase
the device size by much, because chips can be placed one on top of
the other. The assembled pump had dimensions comparable to those of
a cellular phone.

design of high-pressure EO pump chips. All +EO pumps are made on Chip1,
and all −EO pumps are produced on Chip2. Connections between
+EO and −EO pumps are implemented using open capillaries. Electric
potentials are applied to pump channels via polyacrylamide-filled
capillaries. (B) Image showing the capillary connection between Chip1
and Chip2 via round chip channels. (C) Image showing the circular
profile of a round chip channel. (D) Schematic diagram illustrating
how an electric potential is applied to a pump channel. (E) Picture

pump outlet; 6 and 7: grounding electrode; 8: +HV electrode; 9 and
10: electrode reservoirs; 11: connection capillaries; and 12: polyacrylamide-filled
capillaries.

We fabricated round channels
on both chips, and we connected +EO and −EO pumps using open
capillaries via these round channels (See Figure 3B). Figure 3C shows the circular profile
of a round channel from the diced edge of a chip; its diameter (380–400
μm) matched the outer diameter (o.d.) (ca. 375 μm) of
a connection capillary. We call these round channels capillary-incorporation
channels.

We applied electric potentials to the pump channels
via polyacrylamide-filled capillaries to avoid electrolysis inside
pump channels. Eliminating gas bubbles in pump channels is critical
to the success of a microfluidic pump. By using a polyacrylamide-filled
capillary, we effectively eliminated electrolysis-generated bubbles
inside all microfluidic networks. Figure 3D
depicts how it works. After being equilibrated with an electrolyte
buffer solution, the polyacrylamide-filled capillary worked as a salt
bridge; it allowed ions to pass through freely but not the solvent.
When a potential was applied to the Pt electrode, it went all the
way to the pump channel because of the conductive nature of the buffer
solution and the polyacrylamide inside the capillary. As an electric
current passed through the capillary, electrolysis occurred and electrolysis-generated
bubbles formed but only at the Pt electrode in the buffer container.
Electrolysis-generated bubbles were thus eliminated inside all pump
channels. For this reason, we often referred to this setup as a bubbleless
electrode. Because the polyacrylamide was chemically bonded to the
capillary wall, it could withstand high pressures.

Pump Characterization
After we assembled the pump (see Figure 3E), we measured the pumps’ maximum pressure outputs as a function
of the number of pressure power supplies connected in series. The
method for measuring the maximum pump pressure is described in the Supporting Information. These results are presented
in Figure 4A. Apparently, higher pressures
could be achieved by increasing the number of pressure power supplies
connected in series. We did not push for the pressure limit in this
work, because 100–200 bar pressures were adequate for HPLC
separations. We also measured their flow rates under varying backpressures.
The backpressure was provided by an Agilent 1200 HPLC in conjunction
with a flow splitter. The flow rate was measured by measuring the
moving velocity of an air bubble inside a 100 μm-i.d. capillary
between the EO pump and the flow splitter. As expected, the flow rates
decreased as the backpressure increased (see Figure 4B). If we examine this characteristic closely at low backpressures,
while the flow rate decreased with the increasing backpressure, it
remained virtually constant (see Figure S2, Supporting Information). This pump can be useful for manipulating
liquids in microfluidic devices, because the flow rates are often
at the hundreds of nL per minute level or lower while the backpressures
are usually below 40 psi (∼3 bar) for most of the LOC devices.

Figure 4 Pump characterization.
(a) Linear relationship between maximum pressure output and number
of pressure power supplies connected in series. Each pressure power
supply contained 45 parallel pump channels; each pump channel had
a length of 60 mm, a width of 60 μm, and a depth of 1.5 μm.
The voltages applied to the pump channels are indicated in the figure
legends. The pump solution contained 5.0 mM ammonium acetate at pH
= 7. The error bars represent the standard deviations calculated from
3 to 5 repetitive measurements. (b) Pump pressure output as function
of pump rate. PPS in the figure legends is an abbreviation of pressure
power supply.

Demonstration of On-Chip
EO Pump for HPLC Separation
After the pump characterization,
we assembled an HPLC system using a high-pressure on-chip EO pump
as presented in Figure 5a. A picture of the
system is presented in Figure S2, Supporting
Information. The system consisted of a high-pressure on-chip
EO pump, a nanoflow gradient generator, a 10 nL injection valve (V),
a packed C18 capillary column (C), and a UV absorbance detector (D).
The EO pump was constructed by connecting 8 microchip pressure power
supplies in series as shown in Figure 2E. The
nanoflow gradient generator was built using a 10-port valve, as reported
in the literature.24 The valve had two
reagent loops (L1 and L2). When the valve was set at the position
as shown in Figure 5a, the EO pump drove the
eluent solution in L1 into C for elution, while L2 was loaded with
another eluent solution [e.g., E(i)]. As the valve was switched to
another position as shown in the inset, the pump drove E(i) into C
for elution, while L1 was loaded with the next eluent solution [e.g.,
E(i+1), a stronger eluent than E(i)]. These processes could be repeated
until all analytes were eluted out. The 10 nL injection valve was
purchased from VICI Valco (Houston, Texas), the capillary column was
obtained from Waters (NanoEaseTM 75 μm × 100 mm, AtlantisTM
dC18, 3.5 μm) (Milford, Massachusetts), and the UV absorbance
detector was manufactured by Linear Instruments (Reno, Nevada). At
an elution rate of ∼160 nL/min, the column produced a backpressure
of about 70–80 bar; we did not do anything to deliberately
change these parameters.

Figure 5 Performance comparison between EO-pumped HPLC
and Agilent 1200 HPLC. (a) HPLC setup with high-pressure on-chip EO
pump. L1 and L2: two loops on 10-port valve; E(i): eluent i; V: 10

and 100 mm length); D: Linear UVIS 200 absorbance detector (210 nm);
and W: waste. Inset: the other position of the 10-port valve. 6 kV
was applied across all pump channels. (b) Typical chromatograms for
trypsin digests of BSA, TF, and human IgG from the EO-pumped HPLC.
The eluent contained a constant 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and varying
amount of acetonitrile in water. The acetonitrile concentration was
initially increased by 3% every 3 min until 56%, then increased by
2% every 2 min until 60%, and then remained at 60% until the completion
of the run (see the gradient profile in the top panel). The elution
pressure was about 70–80 bar, and the pump rate was ∼160
nL/min. (c) Results from Agilent 1200 HPLC. A flow splitter was used
between the 10 nL injection valve and Agilent 1200 pump. The flow
rate of the Agilent pump was set at 90 μL/min, resulting in
an elution rate of ∼160 nL/min. The gradient stayed at 5% for
the first 2 min, then went from 5% to 20% in 15 min, 20% to 40% in
the next 30 min, 40% to 60% in the next 40 min, and stayed at 60%
to complete the separation. All other conditions were the same as
in (b).

For the Agilent 1200 HPLC, a flow
splitter was used between the 10 nL injection valve and Agilent 1200
pump. A flow rate of 90 μL/min was set on the Agilent pump,
and the flow rate out of the separation column was measured to be
∼160 nL/min, corresponding to a splitting ratio of ∼560:1.
The pressure indicator of the Agilent 1200 showed a backpressure of
76 bar.

Figure 5b,c presents a performance
comparison between chromatograms from the EO-pumped HPLC (Figure 5b) and those from an Agilent 1200 HPLC (Figure 5c). The top panels show the gradient profiles. The
chromatograms (from top to bottom) are for separations of tryptic
digests of BSA, TF, and human IgG, respectively. As can be seen, the
chromatographic efficiencies and resolutions from both systems are
generally comparable (e.g., peak groups a vs a′ and b vs b′).
Resolutions for some peaks in Figure 5b were
higher than those in Figure 5c (e.g., peak
groups d vs d′, e vs e′, and i vs i′), while resolutions for some other peaks in Figure 5b were lower than those in Figure 5c (e.g., peak groups c vs c′). We could identify ∼50 peaks in the two top chromatograms
and ∼40 peaks for the rest of the chromatograms. Comparable
performances should be expected because the same column and similar
separation conditions were used.

Please note that we used the
same pump and the same pump solution throughout the gradient elution
using the approach as depicted in Figure 5a;
we did not need to worry about the pH or composition change of the
pump solution during an HPLC separation. The dynamic coating was reasonably
stable since the pump rate was reduced by less than 5% after a full-day
run. We normally regenerated that pump channel surface by rinsing
the −EO pump channel with 1.0 NaOH and the +EO pump with the
dynamic coating solution for 1 h before we used the pump the following
day.

Conclusions
We have successfully developed a high-pressure
on-chip EO pump, and this fundamental function device is expected
to have a great impact on the advancement of LOC devices. Research
on LOC has been active for more than three decades, but no “killer”
applications have been identified. A microchip HPLC platform could
lead to widespread applications. One potential application is high-throughput
compound screening, because many microchip HPLC systems can be stacked
together to occupy only a small space, and these systems consume a
very small amount of samples and reagents. A hand-held HPLC will also
find applications for point-of-care measurements. The on-chip pump
can also be readily used as constant flow sources (equivalent to constant
current supplies for electronic devices) for routine microfluid manipulations
on LOC devices. For most of the LOC devices, the flow rates are a
few hundred nLs per minute or lower, while the backpressures are usually
below 40 psi (∼3 bar). Figure S2, Supporting
Information, presents the flow rate varying with backpressure.
The flow rate changes were within the measurement errors over the
entire pressure range (from 0 to 3 bar). That is, one will not need
to worry about the viscosity change when he/she uses this pump to
move water, serum, or glycerol. Because the pump was fabricated using
silica wafers and standard photolithographic technologies, it can
be conveniently integrated with other microfabricated functional devices
for developing practical LOC devices. However, regenerating the surfaces
of the pump channels daily will limit the pump’s applications.
