Discovery
of protein biomarkers in clinical samples necessitates
significant prefractionation prior to liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS) analysis. Integrating traveling wave ion
mobility spectrometry (TWIMS) enables in-line gas phase separation
which when coupled with nanoflow liquid chromatography and data independent
acquisition tandem mass spectrometry, confers significant advantages
to the discovery of protein biomarkers by improving separation and
inherent sensitivity. Incorporation of TWIMS leads to a packet of
concentrated ions which ultimately provides a significant improvement
in sensitivity. As a consequence of ion packeting, when present at
high concentrations, accurate quantitation of proteins can be affected
due to detector saturation effects. Human plasma was analyzed in triplicate
using liquid-chromatography data independent acquisition mass spectrometry
(LC-DIA-MS) and using liquid-chromatography ion-mobility data independent
acquisition mass spectrometry (LC-IM-DIA-MS). The inclusion of TWIMS
was assessed for the effect on sample throughput, data integrity,
confidence of protein and peptide identification, and dynamic range.
The number of identified proteins is significantly increased by an
average of 84% while both the precursor and product mass accuracies
are maintained between the modalities. Sample dynamic range is also
maintained while quantitation is achieved for all but the most abundant
proteins by incorporating a novel data interpretation method that
allows accurate quantitation to occur. This additional separation
is all achieved within a workflow with no discernible deleterious
effect on throughput. Consequently, TWIMS greatly enhances proteome
coverage and can be reliably used for quantification when using an
alternative product ion quantification strategy. Using TWIMS in biomarker
discovery in human plasma is thus recommended.

==== Body
Biomarkers are molecules which
alter as a consequence of disease etiology and progression and reflect
the status of the disease.1 They are also
required for the assessment of treatment efficacy, particularly in
preventative regimes.2 Discovering protein
biomarkers is not trivial and requires significant analytical methodology
to enable sufficient separation of highly complex biological samples.
The complexity of samples such as blood or urine is amplified by digesting
the thousand-plus proteins to peptides such that there can be tens
of thousands of peptides in each sample.3 This level of complexity can be partially tackled by ultrahigh pressure
liquid chromatography combined with modern chromatography chemistries
which through improving column capacity enable a higher degree of
analytical separation to occur.4,5 However, because of
the intense complexity of a tryptically treated plasma sample, the
analytical space is still crowded and additional strategies are required
to enable sufficient separation of analytes.

In order to investigate
a greater proportion of the plasma proteome,
prefractionation strategies including 2D-reversed phase (RP)-RP,6 ion exchange (IEX)-RP,7,8 strong
cation exchange (SCX)-RP,8,9 liquid electrophoresis,10 and 1D-gel LC–MS11 are often utilized, and these lead to successful levels of separation
but with significant decreases in throughput, making large clinical
studies unviable.12 Incorporating traveling
wave ion mobility orthogonally to the time-of-flight (TOF) analyzer
(oa-TOF)13 enables a gas phase separation
which, because of its orthogonality, provides additional separation
at no additional cost to throughput.14 Consequently,
the incorporation of traveling wave ion mobility spectrometry (TWIMS)
can be used to replace prefractionation strategies and maintain a
reasonable throughput or used within a prefractionation pipeline to
significantly improve the overall coverage. Previous studies have
shown that quantitation of proteins can be reliably achieved in complex
mixtures using a data independent approach.15 However, up until now there has been no assessment as to the ability
to reliably quantitate proteins in human plasma using TWIMS augmented
LC–MS.

Traveling wave ion mobility enables gas phase
electrophoretic separation
by creating a dynamic pulse of alternating voltages that result in
a “travelling wave” of ions. Ions are separated by their
size, shape, or charge state.13 Ion mobility
(IM) separation is on the millisecond time scale, nesting within the
time scale of nano-LC separation (seconds) and TOF-MS acquisition
(∼100 μs), allowing multiple mass spectra to be taken
of each ion mobility separation16 and providing
an additional degree of peak capacity.17

In order to achieve quantitation, liquid chromatography-data
independent
acquisition mass spectrometry (LC-DIA-MS) takes advantage of the observation
that the quantity of a protein can be stoichiometrically related to
the mean average of the intensities of the three most intense peptides
following the addition of an internal standard.18 The method, also described as LC–MSE,
relies on carrying out an iterative analysis of low collision induced
dissociation (CID) energy followed by an analysis at elevated CID
energy. This iterative process occurs throughout an entire run, and
software is used to bring together the precursor ion with the dissociated
product ions by virtue of their retention time alignment.19 An LC-IM-DIA-MS experiment uses the quantitative
capacity of LC-DIA-MS coupled with the resolving capabilities of traveling
wave ion mobility spectrometry. In a Synapt G2 HDMS instrument, the
region prior to the TOF analyzer contains a TriWave device comprised
of three conjoined stacked ring-electrode ion guides designated trap,
(IMS) separator, and transfer. The separator has a helium cell at
the entrance, which enables higher pressures to be used without encroaching
on the gas phase stability of the molecules.17 The ion mobility experiment is carried out within the TriWave device.
Ions are accumulated within the trap ion guide before a packet of
ions are released into the separator, where mobility separation occurs.
Finally, the ions are transferred into the oaTOF mass analyzer via
the transfer ion guide which maintains the mobility separation of
the ions to the oaTOF. CID occurs in the transfer ion guide after
ions are mobility separated. This means that precursor ions, undergoing
dissociation, exhibit the same mobility drift time as their product
ions. Product ions are thus associated with their precursors by (a)
mobility drift time and (b) chromatographic retention time thus affording
greater specificity with such associations.

Previous work has
demonstrated that LC-IM-DIA-MS presents no compromise
in quantitative precision across sample replicates; however, some
attenuation in quantitative accuracy is observed in proteins of higher
abundance. Shliaha et al.20 identifies
the reduction of signal linearity at the upper end of the dynamic
range as the primary challenge of label-free quantitation on the q-TWIMS-TOF
Synapt G2 design. Additionally, the authors reveal a clear loss in
transmission which is reproducible and consequently not deleterious
to quantitation. Moreover, it is suggested by the authors that the
ion transmission loss could be partially ameliorated by careful use
of specific parameters. Thus, in order to exploit the clear benefits
of incorporating IM into a workflow, steps to overcome the effects
of ion saturation are required. Bond et al. has attempted to improve
quantitation by combining an ion mobility experiment and non-ion mobility
experiment within a single run and then combining the improved separation
qualities of IMS enhanced DIA with the less saturated signals associated
with non-ion mobility runs.21

MS2
or product ion based quantitation strategies have been previously
utilized for relative quantitation in isobaric tagging experiments22 and label-free techniques.23−25 Relative quantitation
aims to detect differential protein expression between samples of
interest; however, amount estimation of proteins offers the greatest
relevance to biomarker studies as absolute amounts of proteins can
be related to cellular processes or pharmacological interventions.
Immunological techniques for absolute quantitation involve targeting
the protein of interest with antibodies, an expensive and low-throughput
process. Using MS2 quantitation allows for the saturation effects
to be reduced by virtue of the fact that the signal intensity of the
product ions are likely to be significantly less intense than the
precursor ion.

Mass spectrometry with absolute quantitation
allows a global survey
of a sample’s proteome with identification and quantitation
in a single step, a feature of particular utility in the analysis
of scarce clinical samples. For this reason, label free quantitation
methods are of particular interest in the search for biomarkers.26 Sample quality is not compromised by additional
preparation procedures as all data required for quantitation are collected
as part of the standard analytical workflow.27

In this paper, the impact of incorporating TWIMS into the
identification
and quantification of proteins is explored by looking at multiple
characteristics that define standard proteomic indices. More specifically,
the impact of using LC-IM-DIA-MS in the discovery of biomarkers in
human plasma is assessed. Data shown in this paper demonstrate that
the challenges in quantitation when incorporating TWIMS, which are
associated with signal saturation, can be overcome using an alternative,
MS2-based, label-free, absolute quantitation method.

Methods
Reagents
HPLC grade water, HPLC grade acetonitrile,
98% molecular biology dithiothreitol, purified grade ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA), and reagent grade iodoacetamide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Poole, Dorset, U.K.). Ultra grade (≥99.5%) ammonium bicarbonate
was purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Mass spectrometry grade
Trypsin Gold was purchased from Promega (Madison WI). Rapigest, enolase
digestion standard (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and
alcohol dehydrogenase digestion standard (S. cerevisiae) were purchased from Waters Corp. (Milford, MA). Lo-Bind sample
tubes were purchased from Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany). LCMS grade
formic acid was purchased from Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, U.K.).
Trasylol was purchased from Bayer (Newbury, U.K.). The 5 kDa molecular
weight cut off spin concentrator tubes were purchased from Agilent
Technologies Inc. (Cheadle, U.K.).

Blood Sample Collection
and Plasma Extraction
Human
blood sample was collected from a healthy donor following informed
consent. A volume of 20 mL of blood was collected in a Sterilin tube
containing 330 μL of Trasylol (= 3000 KIU (Kallikrein Inhibitor
Units)) and 80 μL of 1 M EDTA per 20 mL of blood. The blood
was mixed before centrifugation at 15 000g at 4 °C for 30 min. The plasma layer was separated from the
buffy layer and red blood cells, and stored at −80 °C.

Experimental Design
To reduce biological variation
and allow complete assessment of the effects of traveling wave ion
mobility and alternative quantitation methods on proteome analysis,
a single human plasma sample was prepared with immunodepletion, reduction,
and alkylation. To test the reproducibility of the analysis method,
this sample was divided between six vials and analyzed in triplicate
as a randomized sample list.

Immunodepletion
The top 14 most
abundant proteins were
depleted from human plasma using a Seppro IGY14 LC2 immunodepletion
column (Sigma Aldrich) using the manufacturer’s recommended
protocols and buffers.

Digestion
In order to render all
proteins in the sample
soluble for reduction, alkylation, and digestion, Rapigest was used
as a denaturant. A 1% solution was produced by adding 100 μL
of water to the 1 mg vial of Rapigest. The 1% Rapigest solution was
then added to the sample vial to give a 0.1% final concentration.
Sample was vortexed before incubation at 80 °C for 45 min. After
incubation, sample was centrifuged for 10 s to resettle. Sample was
then reduced with 100 mM aqueous dithiothreitol (DTT) solution added
to give a final concentration of DTT of 5 mM prior to incubation at
60 °C for 30 min. A 200 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) solution was added
to the sample to give a final concentration of 10 mM before incubation
in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. A trypsin solution of
1 μg/μL was added to the sample in a 1:50 w/w ratio. Sample
was vortexed and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Digestion was
halted, and Rapigest cleaved with the addition of 100% formic acid
to the sample to give a final concentration of 0.5%. Sample was centrifuged
at 13 000 rpm for 10 min to remove insoluble material. Supernatant
was transferred as aliquots to six clean sample vials. Sample was
spiked with alcohol dehydrogenase (S. cerevisiae)
for quantitation. Each analysis injection contained 100 fmol of alcohol
dehydrogenase.

Nanoscale Liquid Chromatography
Each sample was analyzed
on a Waters NanoAcquity system (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA).
The peptides were initially loaded onto a Symmetry C18 180 μm
× 20 mm 5 μm trap column to desalt and chromatographically
focus the peptides prior to elution onto a HSS T3 C18 75 μm
× 150 mm, 1.7 μm analytical column. Solvent A, HPLC grade
water with 0.1% formic acid; solvent B, acetonitrile with 0.1% formic
acid was used. The flow rate was set at 0.3 μL/min. The gradient
began following a 3 min (5 μL/min) trapping stage on the trap
column. At time zero, solvent A was 99% while solvent B was 1%. Solvent
B increased linearly to 40% at 90 min and to 85% at 92 min. The gradient
was held at 85% solvent B at 93 min and returned to starting conditions
at 95 min to equilibrate.

Mass Spectrometry
The LC system
was coupled to a Waters
Synapt G2 HDMS (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA). The instrument was
run in positive ion nanoelectrospray ionization mode. The capillary
voltage was set at 3.4 kV and cone voltage at 30 V. Picotip emitters
(10 μm internal diameter, Presearch, Basingstoke, U.K.) were
used for the nanostage to direct flow from the analytical column through
to the source. A helium gas flow of 180 mL/min and ion mobility separator
gas flow (N2) of 90 mL/min with a pressure of 2.5 mbar
was used. An IM wave velocity of 600 m/s and wave height of 40 V was
used throughout each run. During LC-IM-DIA-MS low CID energy, 2 V
was applied across the transfer ion guide. During high CID energy,
a ramp of 27–50 V was applied. Argon was used as the CID gas.
Lockspray of [Glu1]-Fibrinopeptide (GFP) m/z at 785.84265 was used to maintain mass accuracy throughout
the chromatographic run. Data were acquired using MassLynx 4.1.

Data Processing
The raw data was processed with ProteinLynx
Global Server (PLGS) 2.5.2 Data were extracted, aligned, and searched
against the Uniprot human proteomic database, version 2012-07, appended
with the alcohol dehydrogenase (S. cerevisiae) sequence.
The ion accounting algorithm used has been described previously.28 PLGS 2.5.2 utilizes the drift time of mobility
separated peptides to increase the specificity of alignment/association
for precursor and product ions. Data were further processed with Microsoft
Excel 2010, Graphpad Prism 5.03, Stata/IC 12.1 and Origin 8.6.

Product
Ion Quantitation
MS2-High3 quantitation takes
advantage of the observation that MS2 signals compared to their corresponding
MS1 precursors are less likely to lead to signal saturation. MS2-High3
quantitation was performed manually using the search output files
from ProteinLynx Global Server 2.5.2 (PLGS). PLGS assigns peptide
identifications to proteins through an iterative matching process.28 Peptides assigned to proteins in the first matching
pass were selected for use in product ion quantitation.

MS2-High3
was performed for each identified protein by summing the product ion
(MS2) intensity of all associated peptides. The top three most abundant
peptides were selected for onward processing. The MS2 intensities
of these three peptides (MS2 pep) were summed to give each protein
a product ion intensity value (P), eq 1. 1  This value
was compared with the product ion
intensity value of the internal standard protein (IS), alcohol dehydrogenase
(S. cerevisiae) calculated by the same means, eq 2. 2  The ratio
of the product ion intensity value
of the identified protein to the internal standard product ion intensity
value is multiplied by the absolute quantity in fmol of internal standard
(ABSIS) in the sample run, in this case, 100 fmol, to give the absolute
fmol quantity of the identified protein in the run (ABSP), eq 3. 3  Proteins with fewer than
three peptide matches
were quantitated with the corresponding number of alcohol dehydrogenase
peptides. For accuracy, proteins with 100% sequence homology were
excluded from quantitation.

Results
Effects of
the Incorporation of Traveling Wave Ion Mobility
on the Characterization of the Proteome
Initial comparisons
center upon the effect of characterization of the plasma proteome.
More specifically, the sample coverage in terms of the number of proteins
identified was investigated. The results shown in Figure 1 demonstrate that the incorporation of ion mobility
into the workflow results in a more thorough analysis of the sample
content. More cogently, for all samples, more peptides were identified
with LC-IM-DIA-MS reporting an average of 4430 unique peptides per
sample than with LC-DIA-MS, reporting an average of 2036 unique peptides
per sample (Figure 1a). This marked increase
in peptide observation translated to the same trend in protein identification
between the two methods, with an average of 70% more protein identifications
reported for LC-IM-DIA-MS experiments (Figure 1b).

Figure 1 Results plasma analyzed with (black bars) and without (hatched
bars) ion mobility enhanced DIA for different characteristics: (a)
the total number of unique peptides identified and the (b) total number
of unique proteins identified.

Samples were analyzed in triplicate; Figure 2 examines the reproducibility of the two analysis methods
within
the triplicate sets for each sample. When all proteins identified
in at least one run of a sample triplicate run are examined, LC-IM-DIA-MS
yields an average of 70% more protein identifications than LC-DIA-MS
(Figure 2a). The difference between the two
methods rises to 84% when proteins identified in at least two runs
of a triplicate are counted, excluding single-run identifications
(Figure 2b). When proteins appearing in all
three runs of a triplicate for each sample are counted, LC-IM-DIA-MS
yields an average of 88% more protein identifications than LC-DIA-MS
(Figure 2c). These statistics imply that the
inclusion of ion mobility separation into the proteomic workflow confers
a further degree of reproducibility to the sample analysis.

reproducibility: (a) Proteins identified in at
least one run of a sample triplicate. (b) Proteins identified in at
least two runs of a sample triplicate. (c) Proteins identified in
all three runs of a triplicate suggesting that LC-IM-DIA-MS is a more
reproducible analysis method. LC-IM-DIA-MS produces on average, 70%
more protein identifications for replicating identification. Considering
also the proteins found in all runs of the triplicate analysis this
value rises to LC-IM-DIA-MS producing 88% more protein identifications
compared to LC-DIA-MS.

and LC-IM-DIA-MS2-High3 (squares) quantitation methods. Comparison

Effects of Ion Mobility on the Accuracy of
the Analysis
The statistical assignment of proteins relies
on the combination
of a number of parameters to increase confident assignment of protein
identifications. Key proteomic indices of the two analysis methods
were compared, shown in Table 1. In addition
a greater proportion of sequence coverage with LC-IM-DIA-MS was evident
and the precursor and product mass errors are slightly better, displaying
improved precision.

Effect on Quantitation
Quantitation is achieved by
using the intensities of the top three peptides (MS1). However, for
highly abundant ions, the number of detectable ions reaching the detector
results in signal saturation. As intensities of the product ions are
a composite of the precursor ion, the intensities of the individual
product ions will be less intense and consequently are far less likely
to result in saturation of the detector. Consequently, we investigated
whether using the composite product ions for each of three most intense
peptides for each protein might more accurately depict the quantity
of the protein measured. This approach improves the accuracy of the
LC-IM-DIA-MS approach by reducing the impact of detector saturation
on quantitation of highly abundant proteins. This effect is seen in
Figure 3 where proteins are quantified using
LC-DIA-MS (non ion mobility with MS1 label free quantitation), LC-IM-DIA-MS1
(ion mobility with MS1 label free quantitation), and LC-IM-DIA-MS2-High3
(ion mobility with MS2 label free quantitation). In Figure 3, the triangles represent LC-DIA-MS. Here, a series
of measurements fulfills an almost exponential relationship as highly
dominant proteins are measured with the expected abundance in relation
to the majority of the proteins. However, when LC-IM-DIA-MS1 is carried
out, the measurements for the majority of ions is broadly in agreement
with LC-DIA-MS but diverge as the abundant proteins predominate. The
difference in measurements between these two experiments demonstrates
the effect of signal saturation. Using the same data, but instead
using LC-IM-DIA-MS2-High3 for the quantitation method (gray diamonds),
we can see that the divergence between ion mobility and nonion mobility
is reduced considerably for many proteins except the very highly abundant
proteins.

Clustering Analysis
In order to evaluate the relationship
between these three modalities (LC-DIA-MS, LC-IM-DIA-MS, and LC-IM-DIA-MS-MS2-High3),
a statistical assessment of the closeness of fit was executed. Normalized
quantitation values for three exemplar proteins were plotted on 3D
axes. Absolute quantitation data for three example proteins were taken
and compared for all three analysis methods. These proteins were selected
as representative examples of high (Ig γ-4 chain C region),
medium (β-2-glycoprotein 1), and low (zinc-α-2-glycoprotein)
abundance proteins consistently observed across all analysis runs.

These data were normalized to the average absolute quantity of
each protein produced by LC-DIA-MS. The normalized protein quantities
were then plotted on 3D axes to demonstrate quantitation across the
full range of protein abundance by the three analysis methods (Figure 4). This figure demonstrates that although all three
analysis methods are in quantitative agreement for zinc-α-2-glycoprotein,
the protein of low abundance (Figure 4A), LC-IM-DIA-MS
is unable to match the LC-DIA-MS quantitation for the medium and high
abundance proteins (Figure 4B). These data
also illustrate that LC-IM-DIA-MS2-High3 quantitation is in agreement
with LC-DIA-MS at all levels of protein abundance. This is also demonstrated
by Table 2.

Figure 4 Two views of a 3D scatter plot of normalized
protein quantities
showing differential quantitation between analysis methods. Normalized
values for LC-IM-DIA-MS (squares), LC-DIA-MS (triangles), and LC-IM-DIA-MS2
(circles) were plotted on axes of high (Ig γ-4 chain C region,
P01861), medium (β-2-glycoprotein 1, P02749), and low (zinc-α-2-glycoprotein,
P25311) abundance proteins.

Table 2 shows the distance of the
centroid
of each cluster from the origin and the root mean squares (RMS) spread
of the data points around the centroid. The almost identical centroid
distances between LC-DIA-MS and LC-IM-DIA-MS2-High3 demonstrate that
the product ion quantitation method is capable of matching absolute
protein quantitation with LC-DIA-MS across the range of protein abundance.
The lower RMS values for the ion mobility enabled methods indicate
a better signal-to-noise ratio, borne out of the increased sensitivity
associated with ion mobility separation. This data further demonstrates
that MS2-High3 quantitation provides the increased sensitivity and
protein identifications of ion mobility separation combined with the
quantitative accuracy of LC-DIA-MS.

Figure 5 demonstrates the dynamic range
of LC-DIA-MS, LC-IM-DIA-MS, and LC-IM-DIA-MS2-High3 analysis. The
identified protein quantities span 4 orders of magnitude. A key observation
is the increased sensitivity of LC-IM-DIA-MS to detect lower abundance
proteins, as observed by a number of low-abundance proteins previously
unobserved using LC-DIA-MS. Figure 5 shows
the attenuation in quantitation of highly abundant proteins observed
by LC-IM-DIA-MS. This signal saturation effect is overcome by LC-IM-DIA-MS2-High3
quantitation, demonstrated by the quantitation of abundant proteins
in line with LC-DIA-MS quantitation. These data demonstrate that the
experimental dynamic range is increased with the use of the MS2-High3
quantitation method.

Figure 5 Experimental dynamic range for LC-IMS-DIA-MS and LC-DIA-MS,
illustrating
that effective experimental dynamic range is maintained.

If individual proteins are more closely examined
(Figure 6), then a further interesting observation
is revealed.
Six individual proteins that represent putative biomarkers found in
plasma29−34 are found to be within the acceptable analytical range when measured
using LC-IM-DIA-MS2-High3 (as compared to LC-DIA-MS1). Moreover, it
appears that reproducibility is more consistent for these proteins.
This final observation is directly as a consequence of the increased
peak capacity that IM provides. This additional peak capacity provides
greater resolution and, particularly following the CID that takes
place in the transfer region, product ions are more confidently matched
with their precursors by virtue of their chromatographic retention
time and mobility drift time alignment.

methods of LC-IM-DIA-MS1 data and LC-DIA-MS2-High3 data, illustrating

with MS2 quantitation. Proteins shown: P02749, β-2-glycoprotein

Discussion
Proteomic
analysis of human plasma has undoubtedly been compromised
by the inability to deconvolute the complexity of the plasma proteome
in terms of both protein numbers and protein concentration dynamic
range. Two of the potentially 12 orders of magnitude35 are plausibly overcome by the judicious use of immunoaffinity
columns although there still remains a significant dynamic range to
overcome.36 In addition to this, there
is a need to improve the overall resolution of the analytical platform.
Significant improvements in chromatography of peptides have come about
as a consequence of new column chemistries, increasing both reproducibility
and peak capacity.37 However, in a complex
sample such as plasma there are still thousands of analytes which
require separation.

Investigating biology through proteomics
is a long way off in terms
of throughput from genomics. Long LC runs are employed to overcome
the complexity of human plasma. Furthermore for many LC runs, the
actual period in which analytes are eluting represents less than 50%
of the analysis time. Thus, the requirement for an increased role
of gas phase separation is compelling. This separation can be achieved
by incorporating traveling wave ion mobility spectrometry (TWIMS)
into the analytical platform. This dispersive technology has the key
advantage over other ion mobility techniques that the ions are maintained
and not lost through ion selection or filtering of ions.38 It has been investigated whether TWIMS can be
used for the reliable identification and quantification of proteins.
Characteristics associated with protein identification and quantification
to see the effect of using TWIMS within a LC-IM-DIA-MS (HDMSE) experiment has also been assessed.

The use of LC-IM-DIA-MS
results in a greater number of proteins
assigned. Moreover, because the number of sequenced peptides is greater,
not only are more identified proteins observed but the proteins exhibit
higher amino acid sequence coverage. In particular, TWIMS confers
greater advantage because of increased specificity for product and
precursor ion alignment/association which results in a marked reduction
in “chimeric” spectra (which can lead to ambiguity for
peptide/protein ID algorithms). This ultimately results in higher
confidence identifications of low abundance peptides/proteins. Another
characteristic improved by the specificity is the technical reproducibility
(median average of RSD decreased from 13% to 9.5%).

In this
experiment, only a one-dimensional chromatographic separation
was executed. The result is a sample that is rich in highly abundant
proteins which constitute a large proportion of observed proteins.
In a sample that has undergone considerable fractionation, a greater
proportion of observed proteins would be in the range classified as
low-abundance markers and consequently less affected by the underreporting
of the proteins amounts. However, as mentioned above, the measurements
are reproducible and cross-sample comparisons can be made in the context
of highly reproducible analysis.

The inclusion of traveling
wave ion mobility into the workflow
provides greater resolution of the complex plasma samples than standard
LC-DIA-MS. The increase in peptide and protein identifications is
comparable to that observed with extended LC gradients or prefractionation
of samples;12 however, there is no time
penalty or additional preparation steps required for the incorporation
of TWIMS. The inclusion of TWIMS into the proteomic workflow will
confer advantages beyond plasma proteomics into the wider search for
biomarkers as the observed enhancement in the analysis of plasma may
well be replicated in other complex biological mixtures such as cell
lysates, urine, and sputum.

However, in many cases, for proteomics
to be purposeful, it must
be quantitative especially in clinical proteomics. The observation
that proteins of higher abundance are quantitatively under reported
implies a reduction of the in-spectra dynamic range of the Synapt
G2 HDMS instrument. There appears to be a trade-off between the additional
resolution of the plasma proteome, resulting in a greater number of
protein identifications and the quantitation of more highly abundant
proteins. We have shown in this study that the effect of signal saturation
can be reduced when quantitation uses a MS2 strategy which is particularly
beneficial for highly abundant proteins. This novel strategy is robust
and leads to tangible improvements in reproducibility of quantitation.
We chose six proteins, all of which have been implicated as putative
biomarkers in a range of different human pathological conditions.
Revealingly, the quantitation using MS2 mirrored more closely to literature
values and the quantitation found in LC-DIA-MS, a methodology having
widespread acceptance for reliable quantitation. Additionally, in
the specific application of plasma biomarker discovery, any loss in
accuracy is not affected by this quantitative effect as the analysis
of proteins germane to biomarker research remains well within the
tolerance limits of quantitation.

Summary
This work
examines the effect of incorporating traveling wave ion
mobility spectrometry into the LC-DIA-MS workflow for examining the
human plasma proteome. The results demonstrate that the additional
resolution afforded by the method allows a significant deconvolution
of the complex sample. The effects of the observed peptide signal
saturation of abundant proteins are overcome through the use of the
presented MS2-High3 quantitation workflow.
