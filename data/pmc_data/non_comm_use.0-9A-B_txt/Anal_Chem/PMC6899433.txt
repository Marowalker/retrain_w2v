Whole-cell
and cell-free transcription-translation biosensors have
recently become favorable alternatives to conventional detection methods,
as they are cost-effective, environmental friendly, and easy to use.
Importantly, the biological responses from the biosensors need to
be converted into a physicochemical signal for easy detection, and
a variety of genetic reporters have been employed for this purpose.
Reporter gene selection is vital to a sensor performance and application
success. However, it was largely based on trial and error with very
few systematic side-by-side investigations reported. To address this
bottleneck, here we compared eight reporters from three reporter categories,
i.e., fluorescent (gfpmut3, deGFP, mCherry, mScarlet-I), colorimetric
(lacZ), and bioluminescent (luxCDABE from Aliivibrio fischeri and Photorhabdus
luminescens, NanoLuc) reporters, under the
control of two representative biosensors for mercury- and quorum-sensing
molecules. Both whole-cell and cell-free formats were investigated
to assess key sensing features including limit of detection (LOD),
input and output dynamic ranges, response time, and output visibility.
For both whole-cell biosensors, the lowest detectable concentration
of analytes and the fastest responses were achieved with NanoLuc.
Notably, we developed, to date, the most sensitive whole-cell mercury
biosensor using NanoLuc as reporter, with an LOD ≤ 50.0 fM
HgCl2 30 min postinduction. For cell-free biosensors, overall, NanoLuc and deGFP led to shorter response
time and lower LOD than the others. This comprehensive profile of
diverse reporters in a single setting provides a new important benchmark
for reporter selection, aiding the rapid development of whole-cell
and cell-free biosensors for various applications in the environment
and health.

==== Body
Whole-cell
biosensors are cells
that detect and report a target or condition of interest.1−4 Due to being renewable, environmental friendly, and cost-effective,
they have drawn increasing attention as viable alternatives to electronic
or chemical sensors over the last three decades.2,3 Notably,
in the rising era of synthetic biology, a growing number of engineered
whole-cell biosensors have been researched for a broad range of applications,
such as environmental assessment,3,5−7 clinical diagnosis8,9 and biotherapy,10,11 controlled bioprocessing,12,13 mineral surveying,14 and landmine clearing.15

Meanwhile the cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL)
system
is becoming a favorable technology for in vitro synthetic
biology study due to its capability of flexibility, stability, portability,
and fast prototyping as well as creating a minimal cellular environment.16−19 Because the cell-free system (CFS) contains no cells but only the
basic biological machineries and energy sources required for TX-TL,20 it has been proposed as a feasible solution
to circumvent the biosafety issues associated with whole-cell biosensing.19 Hence, a number of cell-free biosensors have
been developed recently to detect heavy metals,21 antibiotics,22 and pathogens.23,24

Both whole-cell and cell-free biosensors share a similar architecture
comprising a sensing module, a computing module, and an output actuating
module.1−3 Many reporter proteins that produce light,8,25,26 fluorescence,5,15 colors,23,27 electrons,28 or gas vesicles29 can be used as genetic reporters in the output
module.

Like other genetic devices or gene expression studies,17,30 many biosensors were first built with fluorescent reporters as the
output actuator,3,5,15,24 thus simplifying their characterization
in laboratory settings. Fluorescent proteins are relatively stable
and take a short time to mature, and their light emission can be readily
measured by a fluorimeter under specific light excitation. In addition,
they can be used to study sensor cells at single cell level by fluorescence
microscopy or fluorescence activated cell sorting.

Colorimetric
reporters are often used to allow direct visualization
of sensor output by the naked eye, which can drive down the operating
costs of readout machines. As the first enzyme used to produce colorimetric
output in engineered biosensors,31 β-galactosidase
(i.e., LacZ) from Escherichia coli lac operon is
the most popular enzyme used for both whole-cell and cell-free biosensors.19,21,23 The LacZ-catalyzed hydrolysis
is fast,19 but many bacterial strains contain
an intact lac operon, which will increase the background
of the colorimetric output.

Bioluminescent reporters are also
based on biochemical reactions
which produce light without the need of an excitation light source.
Among them, bacterial (LuxCDABE or LuxAB)8,32 and
firefly (LucFF)33 luciferases are often
used in whole-cell or cell-free biosensors. Owing to its high luminescent
activity and small size (19 kDa), the recently engineered NanoLuc
luciferase has become a favored bioluminescent reporter for whole-cell
biosensors.25,34 Many of these bioluminescent
biosensors have been coupled with portable devices for field testing
or on-site diagnosis.8,25,35 However, unless the whole luciferase cassette is present, an external
substrate such as d-luciferin, coelenterazine, or furimazine
is required, limiting their applications for continuous monitoring.

Although a variety of genetic reporters have been thoroughly studied,
their selections for biosensor engineering were more based on one’s
experience rather than systematic side-by-side investigations. A few
prior studies have been carried out to compare a couple of reporter
categories; however, they were either not from the view of biosensor
applications or not in directly comparable settings.7,36−38 To facilitate biosensor engineering, it is of great
importance to compare different reporter categories systemically while
evaluating their contributions to sensing performance. To this end,
here we characterized and compared three widely used reporter categories,
i.e., fluorescent, colorimetric, and bioluminescent reporters, under
two representative biosensors of mercury- and quorum-sensing molecule
within two different sensor settings, i.e., whole-cell and cell-free
contexts. We investigated their properties in terms of contributions
to analytical performance and key sensing features including limit
of detection (LOD), input and output dynamic ranges, response time,
and output visibility. Such a comprehensive profile provides a new
benchmark reference for reporter gene selection, which will aid the
rapid development of whole-cell and cell-free biosensors for various
applications.

Experimental Section
Strains, Chemicals, and
Reagents
Plasmid cloning and in vivo genetic
circuit characterization were all performed
in E. coli TOP10. Cells were cultured in Lysogeny
broth (LB) medium (10 g L–1 peptone, 5 g L–1 NaCl, 5 g L–1 yeast extract), with appropriate
antibiotics. The antibiotic concentrations used were 50 μg mL–1 for both kanamycin and ampicillin (for low copy number
plasmid) or 100 μg mL–1 for ampicillin (for
high copy number plasmid). Antibiotics and inducers (i.e., mercury(II)
chloride (HgCl2) and N-(β-ketocaproyl)-l-homoserine lactone (3OC6HSL)) were analytical grade
and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. They were dissolved in ddH2O or nuclease free H2O (W4502, Sigma-Aldrich) and were
then filtered using 0.22 μm syringe filters (SLGP033RS, Millipore).

LacZ substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside
(X-gal) (MB1001, Melford) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
(D8418, Sigma-Aldrich) to make 2% or 5% (w/v) stock solutions. Substrate
furimazine for NanoLuc luciferase was from Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay
System (N1110, Promega).

Plasmid Circuit Construction
Standard
molecular biology
techniques were used to construct plasmids containing mercury- and
quorum-sensing molecule-responsive genetic circuits. All plasmids
were constructed via BioBrick assembly39 and standard PCR. BioBrick vectors pSB1A3, pSB4A3, and pSB3K3 were
used for plasmids cloning, and pSB3K3 was used for sensor circuit
characterization (http://biobricks.org). Plasmid maps and detailed configurations are provided in relevant
figures and summarized in Figure S1. Sequence
details and sources of relevant parts are listed in Table S1. All primers used in this study, listed in Table S2, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
All plasmids constructed in this study have been confirmed by Sanger
sequencing (Source BioScience). Detailed plasmid construction procedures
are described in Supporting Information.

Reporter Gene Expression Assay in Vivo
For in vivo reporter gene characterization, engineered E. coli with constructed sensor plasmids were induced with
HgCl2 or 3OC6HSL, and the reporter signals were
measured using a plate reader (BMG FLUOstar) post 30, 60, 90,120,
180, 240, 300, and 360 min induction and incubation. NanoLuc-conducted
bioluminescent and LacZ-conducted colorimetric measurements were acquired
in lysing and nonlysing conditions using the same concentration of
substrates (X-gal = 0.04 mg mL–1 from 2% X-gal stock
solution and 0.2 μL of furimazine stock solution per 200 μL
of culture). NanoLuc-derived bioluminescent kinetics were measured
for 30 min after substrate addition, and the highest signal was chosen
for data analysis. Colorimetric signal measurement was preceded by
30 min incubation at 37 °C, with orbital shaking at 300 rpm in
the plate reader. To determine the cell density, absorbance (A600) was also read prior to each reporter measurement.
For the lux operon reporter, the bioluminescent signal
was measured immediately after absorbance measurement without the
addition of substrates. Unless indicated otherwise, each reporter
within different sensors was tested with three biological replicates.
All the data shown are mean values with standard deviation as error
bars. Detailed experimental procedures, data analysis, and instrument
settings for reporter measurements and visualization are described
in Supporting Information.

Reporter Gene
Expression Assay in Vitro
The cell-free
reactions were performed using E. coli S30 Extract
System for Circular DNA (L1020, Promega) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Each reaction contained 40% (v/v)
S30 premix, 10% (v/v) amino acid mix, 30% (v/v) S30 extract, and 2%
(v/v) inducer. The remaining 18% (v/v) contained DNA template with
or without substrates. A 9.6 nM DNA template was used for each reporter
within the mercury-sensing circuit and for the negative control (reaction
with empty pSB3K3). A 9.2 nM DNA template was used for each reporter
within the quorum-sensing molecule-responsive circuit. Fluorescent
and colorimetric reporters within each sensor were measured continuously
using BMG FLUOstar plate reader after induction. For LacZ reporter
characterization, 5% X-gal was supplied into cell-free mixture before
incubation (with 0.042% X-gal as the final concentration). For NanoLuc
reporter characterization, 0.5 μL of furimazine stock solution
was added to each well of the cell-free mixture after 20, 40, 60,
120, 180, and 240 min incubation. Unless indicated otherwise, all
the reporters within different sensors were tested in two independent
experiments and each with three technical replicates. All the data
shown are mean values with standard deviation as error bars. Detailed
experimental procedures, data analysis, and instrument settings for
reporter measurements are described in Supporting Information. Calculation of sensor detection limit, mathematical
modeling, and data fitting for both whole-cell and cell-free biosensors
are described in Supporting Information.

Results and Discussion
Design and Standardization of Reporter Expression
Characterization
for Biosensors
We characterized eight different genetic reporters
to compare their main advantages and limitations contributing to the
sensing performance of both whole-cell and cell-free biosensors. Fluorescent
reporter genes gfp (gfpmut3), deGFP, mCherry, and mScarlet-I, luciferase genes NanoLuc and lux operons from Aliivibrio fischeri and Photorhabdus
luminescens, and colorimetric output gene lacZ have been selected and profiled within the same biosensor settings
both in vivo and in vitro (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Comprehensive profiling
of diverse genetic reporters in whole-cell
and cell-free expression biosensor systems. Three categories of genetic
reporters are selected to compare their profiles when applied in whole-cell
and cell-free biosensors: (1) green fluorescent reporters (i.e., gfp and deGFP) and red fluorescent reporters
(i.e., mCherry and mScarlet-I),
(2) colorimetric reporter (i.e., lacZ), and (3) bioluminescent
reporters (i.e., NanoLuc and lux operons from A. fischeri and P. luminescens). Response time, limit of detection (LOD), output dynamic range,
and basal expression (leakiness) are tested for those reporters within
both the mercury- and quorum-sensing molecule-responsive sensors.

Two biosensing systems for the mercury ion and
3OC6HSL
quorum-sensing molecule have been designed and standardized to characterize
and compare the selected reporters (Figure S1). The medium copy number plasmid pSB3K3 (10–12 copies per
cell40) was used for characterizing all
reporters to limit the metabolic burden. The output actuating modules
coupled with selected reporters were placed in opposite directions
to the sensing modules to prevent potential transcriptional read-through
to the reporter from the sensing module. All reporters within the
two sensing systems were tested under the same condition either in E. coli TOP10 or in E. coli S30 CFS. LOD,
input and output dynamic ranges, response time, and output visibility
were profiled for each reporter.

In Vivo Characterization and Comparison of
Genetic Reporters
We first tested all chosen genetic reporters
within a sensitive mercury sensor (i.e., J23109-merR-PmerT).41 This sensor has a constitutive promoter (J23109) that drives the
expression of the mercury receptor MerR, which would derepress its
cognate promoter PmerT upon mercury (Hg2+) binding and trigger the expression of the downstream reporter
gene (Figure 2A).42 Cell phone images, induction fold, and dose–response
curves were obtained postinduction of mercury (HgCl2) at
various concentrations and different incubation times (Figure 2B–E, Figures S2–S4).

Figure 2 Characterization of diverse genetic reporters
within a mercury-responsive
whole-cell biosensor. (A) Schematic of a mercury-responsive sensor
module (J23109-merR-PmerT) coupled to a genetic reporter. (B–E) Dose–response
curves and cell phone images of the mercury sensor with red fluorescent
reporters mCherry and mScarlet-I (B), green fluorescent reporters
GFP and deGFP (C), colorimetric reporter LacZ with the cells lysed
or not lysed (D), and bioluminescent reporters NanoLuc with cells
lysed or not lysed and LuxCDABE from P. luminescens (E). The last well in each cell phone image shows the reporter-free
negative control cultures. Data were collected 360 min postinduction
for B and C, and 90 min postinduction for D and E. Values are mean
± SD (n = 3 biologically independent experiments).

Comparing among the red fluorescent proteins (Figure 2B), we reported an
induction
fold over the control of 59.2 and 14.6 for mScarlet-I and mCherry,
respectively (Figure S3), and LOD of 15.63
nM mercury for mCherry and 7.81 nM mercury for mScarlet-I (Figure S4), suggesting that mScarlet-I performs
better than mCherry as a reporter. We deem this could be due to faster
maturation and higher brightness of mScarlet than mCherry.43 Comparing GFP and deGFP (Figure 2C), we reported that GFP had a higher fold
of induction (51.3 vs 17.3), lower LOD (7.81 nM vs 125.00 nM of HgCl2, Figure S4), and faster response
(Figures S2,S3).

Both colorimetric
reporter LacZ and bioluminescent reporter NanoLuc
under the mercury sensor were monitored with lysed and nonlysed cells
(see Experimental Section). Both reporters’
performance was improved in cell lysing conditions in terms of response
time, LOD, output dynamic range, and output visibilities (Figure 2D,E, Figures S2–S4), suggesting that the cell
membrane could limit diffusion and transport of the substrates. For
LacZ, the best LOD (0.49 nM of HgCl2) with cell lysis was
achieved 60 min postinduction, while the best LOD without cell lysis
was 7.81 nM HgCl2 (16-fold higher) after 6 h induction
(Figure S4). For NanoLuc, the best LOD
(5.00 × 10–5 nM HgCl2) with cell
lysis was obtained 30 min postinduction, while the best LOD without
cell lysis was three orders higher (0.05 nM HgCl2) and
was observed 3 h postinduction and postincubation.

As concerns lux operons from A. fischeri and P. luminescens, only the lux operon from P. luminescens showed notable output
upon mercury induction (Figure 2E, Figure S6). In addition, the P. luminescens luciferase contributed to a lower LOD (5.00
× 10–4 nM of HgCl2) at early stage
after induction (30–90 min), and higher output dynamic range
at intermediate stage (90–120 min) (Figures S4 and S6). However, its overall performance was not comparable
to that of NanoLuc with cell lysis. Compared to the NanoLuc without
cell lysis, it remains a good bioluminescent reporter due to no requirement
of adding substrates and lysing cells. Similar results were observed
when testing the two operons under the quorum-sensing molecule sensor
(Figures S6 and S7). Previous studies have
shown that the luciferase from A. fischeri was thermolabile,
with enzyme denaturation occurring above 30 °C, while the luciferase
from P. luminescens was thermostable.44 As all the experiments were performed at 37
°C, the activity of the luciferase from A. fischeri may have been inhibited due to denaturation. This was confirmed
by characterizing the luciferase reporter under different temperatures,
where the A. fischeri luciferase showed better activity
at lower temperature in LB (Figure S7).
Different media (i.e., M9 with glycerol or glucose as carbon source)
were also tested, indicating that salt and glucose levels could affect
the two luciferases’ activities (Figure S7).45

Pros and Cons of Different
Reporter Categories Acting in Vivo
mScarlet-I,
GFP, LacZ (with cell lysis),
and NanoLuc (with cell lysis) were selected for further analyses and
investigation, as they showed superior performance in response time,
LOD, and output dynamic range when compared to other reporters within
their own categories.

We first compared the four reporters under
the mercury sensor (Figure 3A). The best dose–responses for each reporter and the
cognate fold of induction were analyzed (Figure 3B,C). The sensors with mScarlet-I and GFP
reporter showed similar LOD and induction fold, both of which were
improved with longer incubation time (Figure 3C, Figure S4).
However, we observed high background level, especially for green fluorescence,
due to autofluorescence from bacterial cells and LB medium, limiting
their use for direct visualization (Figure S2). In contrast, LacZ and NanoLuc showed very low background, facilitating
their direct visualization by the naked eye. Moreover, they contributed
to faster response (30 min for LacZ and NanoLuc vs 60 min for GFP
and mScarlet-I), much lower LOD (16-fold lower for LacZ and 5 orders
of magnitude lower for NanoLuc) and broader input dynamic ranges than
the fluorescent reporters, which indicates the fast enzymatic reaction-based
reporters are preferable for sensors requiring a short and sensitive
response. This observation is consistent with previous studies.7,36,38 Nevertheless, both reporters
with cell lysis are only suitable for disposable sensors with single-time-point
readout. In addition, short time incubation will be required to obtain
the best LOD and output dynamic range (Figure 3C, Figure S4)
due to background activity induced by the sensor’s leakiness,
which is more sensitive toward amplified enzymatic reactions than
fluorescent reporters (Figure S2).

genetic reporters within mercury and quorum-sensing
molecule whole-cell biosensors. (A, D) Schematics showing the mercury-
or quorum-sensing molecule sensor module (J23109-merR-PmerT or J23117-luxR-Plux2) coupled to an output genetic

molecule sensors with different reporters. For mScarlet-I and GFP,
data were collected 360 min postinduction and postincubation. For
LacZ and NanoLuc, data were collected 90 min postinduction. Dose–responses
for the sensors at different time points are shown in Figures S4 and S5, and the relevant cell phone
images are shown in Figures S2 and S8.

HgCl2 (C) and 0.04 μM 3OC6HSL (F) respectively.
Induction fold was calculated using the output with induction divided
by the output without induction. Values are mean ± SD (n = 3 biologically independent experiments).

To test the generality of the aforementioned reporters’
performance, we next characterized the same set of reporters under
a different sensing system, i.e., a quorum-sensing molecule (3OC6HSL)-responsive sensor (J23117-luxR-Plux2, Figure 3D–F).46 In this sensing
system, a constitutive promoter (J23117) drives the expression of
the 3OC6HSL-responsive LuxR receptor which activates its
cognate promoter Plux2 when bound to 3OC6HSL (Figure 3D).46 Similar to the performance of reporters
under the mercury sensor, GFP and mScarlet-I under the quorum-sensing
molecule sensor showed similar dose–response curves and LOD,
and both their LOD and induction fold were improved with longer incubation
time (Figure 3E,F, Figure S5). Similarly, LacZ and NanoLuc showed
much lower LOD (3–4 orders of magnitude lower than the fluorescent
reporters) and faster responses (30 min for LacZ and NanoLuc vs 60
min for GFP and mScarlet-I) than the fluorescent reporters. Notably,
NanoLuc provided the lowest LOD (3.81 × 10–4 nM of 3OC6HSL) among all reporters characterized (Figure S5). Similar high background leakiness
and decreasing induction fold across time were observed under the
quorum-sensing molecule sensor (Figure 3F, Figure S8). In contrast
to reporters under the mercury sensor, the best induction folds of
LacZ and NanoLuc under the quorum-sensing molecule sensor were observed
at longer incubation time. However, it is worth noting that the induction
levels for the two types of sensors are not comparable and their output
kinetics are different.

Interestingly, we observed a biphasic
dose–response curve
for the mercury sensor particularly with the NanoLuc reporter with
cell lysis (Figures 2E,3B). Such a response curve was not observed
for the quorum-sensing molecule sensor, suggesting the biphasic dose–response
is largely due to the intrinsic sensing behavior of the mercury-sensing
system. Unlike the transcriptional activator LuxR, MerR is a repressor-activator.42 Moreover, previous studies suggested that with
only one Hg2+ binding to the MerR homodimer, the MerR could
activate transcription but at a moderate rate, while the MerR homodimer
bound with two Hg2+ could fully activate the transcription.42 Therefore, the mercury sensor may respond to
low mercury induction at a moderate rate while the response may be
significantly increased in the presence of high mercury. This may
explain why the biphasic dose–response curve occurred for the
mercury sensor, particularly using NanoLuc reporter with cell lysis
(Figures 2E and 3B). If the biphasic dose–response curve is
not preferred, the data can be collected at an earlier time point
postinduction and postincubation to eliminate such response behavior
while maintaining similar high sensitivity (Figure S4A).

Characterization and Comparison of Genetic
Reporters in TX-TL
CFS
To provide a more comprehensive profiling of the different
genetic reporters for biosensing, we compared the same reporters in
an in vitro TX-TL CFS using cell-free biosensors.
The CFS can be either based on crude cell extract47 or a system of purified recombinant elements (PURE) necessary
for transcription-translation.48 The former
is cheaper, easier to produce and more widely used in the field and
therefore was selected for the reporter characterization in this study.
Mercury- and quorum-sensing molecule sensors were also used for the in vitro test to provide a comparable context to their in vivo performance (Figure 4). To generate the same sensing activities for each
sensor with different genetic reporters in the CFS, the same molar
concentration of the sensory plasmids for each sensor was tested.
Time-course response curves (Figure 4B,E), fold of induction (Figure 4C,F) and dose–responses (Figures S9 and S10) were analyzed for both sensors
of different reporters. The experiments have been repeated at least
twice independently (Figure S11).

Figure 4 Profiling diverse
genetic reporters within cell-free biosensors.
(A, D) Schematics showing the mercury- or quorum-sensing molecule
sensor (J23115-merR-PmerT or J23101-luxR-Plux2) coupled to diverse genetic reporters. (B, E) Dynamic output responses

calculated using the sensor output with induction divided by the sensor
output without induction. Values are mean ± SD (n = 3 technical replicates). a.u., arbitrary units.

Overall, the sensors with green fluorescent reporters or
enzymatic
reporters responded faster (20 min) and were more sensitive than the
sensors with red fluorescent reporters (60 min) (Figure 4C,F, Figures S9, S10, and S11C,F). This meets our expectation, as the green
fluorescent reporters generally mature faster than the red fluorescent
reporters,49 and the enzymatic reactions
are usually more sensitive and can amplify the sensor’s output
signals. However, additional substrates are required for the enzymatic
reaction, which is costly and unstable, whereas the high autofluorescence
from the cell-free reagent could affect the measurement of the green
fluorescent reporters. The LacZ substrate X-gal is more stable and
cheaper than the NanoLuc substrate furimazine and can be added into
the cell-free mixture at the beginning of induction. Nevertheless,
cell-free sensors with LacZ reporter have low induction fold due to
the sensors’ high background caused by leakiness and hence
low output dynamic range of the cognate color change. In addition,
the commercial CFS we used was made from a lacZ+
cell strain and hence already contains some background level of LacZ,
thus increasing the background leakiness and reducing the output dynamic
range. Using a LacZ-free CFS or a more sensitive LacZ substrate may
improve this reporter’s performance in vitro.

Surprisingly, both green fluorescent reporters and NanoLuc
provided
the best LOD among all the reporters (Figures S9 and S10) but with a shorter incubation time for the latter
(Figure S10B). For the mercury sensor,
the GFP reporter contributed to an LOD < 1.0 × 10–3 μM mercury, making it the most sensitive one among all cell-free
mercury sensors constructed to date. For the quorum-sensing molecule
sensor, both deGFP (4 h) and NanoLuc (40 min) contributed to an LOD
< 4.0 × 10–3 μM 3OC6HSL,
5–10 times lower than the rest of reporters.

When each
reporter category was compared, mScarlet-I was superior
to mCherry in terms of response time and induction fold (Figure 4C,F, Figure S11C,F), similar to their performance in vivo. However, the comparison of GFP and deGFP was less
conclusive. The fluorescence output of deGFP was much higher than
that of GFP under the quorum-sensing molecule sensor (Figure 4E, Figure S11E) while it was only true for the mercury sensor under high
mercury induction levels (Figure 4B, Figure S11B). deGFP was
designed to be more translatable in CFS than its original eGFP,50 but its performance against GFPmut3 (i.e., the
GFP we tested here) has not been studied previously. Because deGFP
worked well for both mercury- and quorum-sensing molecule sensors,
it may be a more reliable reporter for regular cell-free biosensors.
Further investigation would aid an in-depth comparison of their performance
as a reporter, for example, by measuring the reporters’ fluorescent
intensity, maturation, and transcription and translation efficiency
in different genetic contexts.

Conclusions
In
summary, we provided a comprehensive profiling of eight different
genetic reporters from three commonly used reporter categories (i.e.,
fluorescent, colorimetric, and bioluminescent detection) within two
representative sensor systems both in vivo and in vitro. The selected reporters have been frequently used
in either whole-cell or cell-free biosensors but barely compared systematically
in terms of their contributions to sensing features, limiting the
biosensors’ development and applications. NanoLuc luciferase
is a noticeable reporter due to its small size and high luminescent
activity. Our study for the first time showed its characteristics
in bacterial whole-cell biosensors and cell-free biosensors and indicated
its superior reporting performance in both sensing systems. Overall,
we reported that enzymatic reporters (especially bioluminescent reporter
NanoLuc) provided the fastest response and lowest LOD in vivo. Both green fluorescent reporters and the enzymatic reporters contributed
to the fastest response and lowest LOD in vitro.
Considering the drastic differences and wide representation of the
two sensor systems tested, similar conclusions obtained from the two
sensor systems indicate the generality of our findings regarding the
performance of these different genetic reporters. Therefore, these
results can be reasonably applied to and inform the development of
biosensors for other targets. However, the choice of sensor reporters
also need to take into account several other important factors pertinent
to their real world application requirements, such as the background
signal level (green fluorescent reporter has the highest background
activity), cost, and stability of the substrates for enzymatic reporters,
whether an end-point data acquisition is sufficient or a continuous
monitoring is preferred, and whether the cells can be lysed or not.
This study provides new important benchmark for biosensor reporter
gene selection, which will aid the rapid development of different
whole-cell and cell-free biosensors for a variety of applications
in the environment and health.
