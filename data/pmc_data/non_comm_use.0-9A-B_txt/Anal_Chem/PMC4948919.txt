Heparan sulfate (HS)
polysaccharides are ubiquitous in animal tissues
as components of proteoglycans, and they participate in many important
biological processes. HS carbohydrate chains are complex and can contain
rare structural components such as N-unsubstituted
glucosamine (GlcN). Commercially available HS preparations have been
invaluable in many types of research activities. In the course of
preparing microarrays to include probes derived from HS oligosaccharides,
we found an unusually high content of GlcN residue in a recently purchased
batch of porcine intestinal mucosal HS. Composition and sequence analysis
by mass spectrometry of the oligosaccharides obtained after heparin
lyase III digestion of the polysaccharide indicated two and three
GlcN in the tetrasaccharide and hexasaccharide fractions, respectively. 1H NMR of the intact polysaccharide showed that this unusual
batch differed strikingly from other HS preparations obtained from
bovine kidney and porcine intestine. The very high content of GlcN
(30%) and low content of GlcNAc (4.2%) determined by disaccharide
composition analysis indicated that N-deacetylation
and/or N-desulfation may have taken place. HS is
widely used by the scientific community to investigate HS structures
and activities. Great care has to be taken in drawing conclusions
from investigations of structural features of HS and specificities
of HS interaction with proteins when commercial HS is used without
further analysis. Pending the availability of a validated commercial
HS reference preparation, our data may be useful to members of the
scientific community who have used the present preparation in their
studies.

==== Body
Heparan sulfate (HS) is ubiquitous
in animal tissues occurring as components of proteoglycans. They participate
in many important biological processes interacting with a wide range
of proteins, such as cytokines and chemokines,1 fibroblast growth factors,2 and the coagulation
regulator antithrombin, in addition to pathogenic agents involved
in inflammation3 and amyloid diseases.4 HS polysaccharides are complex carbohydrate chains.
Alternating (1-4)-linked α-N-acetylglucosamine
(GlcNAc) and β-glucuronic acid (GlcA) comprise most of their
primary sequence with heterogeneity arising from different degrees
of N-deacetylation/N-sulfation,
isomerization of GlcA to iduronic acid (IdoA), and variation in O-sulfation. The most highly sulfated regions of HS contain
3 sulfates per disaccharide unit, 6-O- and 2-N-disulfoglucosamine and 2-O-sulfo-IdoA
(GlcNS6S-IdoA2S) whereas the least sulfated regions contain the GlcNAc-GlcA
disaccharide unit. There also occur some less common structural elements,
such as 3-O-sulfo or N-unsubstituted
glucosamine (GlcN).

In the past, the presence of GlcN in HS
chains was generally of
little concern. The importance of this rare structural component was
recognized only in the 1990s5−11 and has attracted various interest.12−15 Although this unusual residue
in HS can be formed as an artifactual product introduced during preparation
and purification (particularly at low pH), its occurrence in the HS
chain is now thought to be formed through regulated, incomplete action
of an N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase.16 GlcN amounts to 0.7 to 4% of total glucosamine
in HS16 or 1 to 2 residues in each HS chain17 depending on the source. The GlcN residue occurs
largely near the polysaccharide-protein linkage region of HS chains,
with less frequent peripheral location.16 The GlcN unit has been shown to be part of HS antigens recognized
by monoclonal antibodies 10E411,18 and JM403.5,19 The antigen recognized by 10E4 antibody is closely associated with
prion lesions in the brain of mice infected with scrapie.20

Commercially available HS polysaccharides
have been invaluable
in many types of research activities. HS isolated from bovine kidney
is available from Sigma but is expensive. Porcine intestinal mucosa
is a major source for the manufacture of heparin sodium salt used
in medicine, and HS can be extracted from the mixture of glycosaminoglycans
(GAGs) remaining after the extraction of heparin.21−23 HS from this
source is available from Celsus. We have in the past used Celsus HS
to investigate the presence of free GlcN residue and its recognition
by monoclonal antibody 10E412 and lyase
III activity toward GlcN residues.12

In the present study, during the preparation of GAG microarrays24 to include probes from oligosaccharide fractions
of HS, we found an unusually high content of free GlcN residue in
the batch HO-01214, recently ordered from Celsus. Although we have
in the past identified GlcN in HS from Celsus, its incidence in batch
HO-01214 was exceptionally high.

For preparation of oligosaccharides,
HO-01214 of HS was partially
depolymerized by heparin lyase III. The digestion product was fractionated
by gel filtration chromatography on Bio-Gel P6 (Supplemental Figure S1) and the oligosaccharide fragments
were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS).25

The MS results together with the derived
composition are listed
in Table 1 and representative
spectra in Figure 1a–d. Oligosaccharide fraction F1 contains exclusively the
disaccharide ΔUA-GlcNS, but to our surprise, a very high content
of free GlcN-containing components were found in the tetra- (F2) and
larger oligosaccharide fractions, e.g., hexa-, octa-, and decasaccharides
(F3, F4, and F5, respectively). In fraction F2a, the main component
at m/z 673 (Figure 1b) is a tetrasaccharide which contains two
GlcN residues. We could also readily identify up to three GlcN in
a hexasaccharide and four GlcN in an octasaccharide sequence (Table 1).

Figure 1 Negative-ion ESI-MS and
CID-MS/MS spectra of selected HS-01214
oligosaccharide fractions. Mass spectra of the first four fractions
(see Supplemental Figure S1) are shown:
(a) Fraction 1; (b) Fraction 2a; (c) Fraction 2b; and (d) Fraction
3. Product-ion spectrum of Fraction F2a using [M – H]− at m/z 673 as the precursor is
shown in part e; the observed fragmentation was consistent to the
proposed structure.

a Relative intensity
(% relative to
the base peak) is shown in parentheses; when the ion is the base peak, relative intensity (100%)
was not shown.

b Although
both ΔUA-GlcNS-UA-GlcN
and ΔUA-GlcN-UA-GlcNS are possible, lyase III does not favor
GlcN-UA for cleavage,12 and therefore ΔUA-GlcNS-UA-GlcN
is not proposed as the main tetrasaccharide product.

Collision-induced dissociation and
tandem MS (ESI-CID-MS/MS) for
sequence analysis was carried out to verify the presence of the unusual
consecutive GlcN residues in the linear chain.12 As shown in the spectra, indeed tetrasaccharide (Figure 1e) and hexasaccharide
(Supplemental Figure S2a) with exclusive
GlcN can be confirmed.

Among the identified main ions in the
di- to deca-saccharide fractions,
only one component, m/z 715, present
in fraction F3, contains a single N-acetylglucosamine
residue with the sequence of ΔUA-GlcN-UA-GlcNAc (Table 1 and Supplemental Figure S2b). All the other ion species identified contain GlcN
and/or GlcNS without GlcNAc. Although sequences with glucosamine fully N-sulfated (GlcNS) can be found in the di- and tetrasaccharide
fractions (e.g., ΔUA-GlcNS-UA-GlcNS), only partially N-sulfated glucosamine were present in the higher oligomeric
fractions (e.g., ΔUA-GlcN-UA-GlcN-UA-GlcNS).

This is in
complete contrast to the data we obtained in our early
study11 using a previous batch of HS from
the same source (see below), in which only a single GlcN was identified
that was located within an unusual nonsulfated tetrasaccharide sequence.
To ensure that in the present study the large amount of GlcN was not
produced during our enzymatic depolymerization and fractionation procedure,
we carried out 1H NMR analysis of the intact HO-01214 polysaccharide
in comparison with other HS preparations obtained from bovine kidney
and porcine intestine.

1H NMR spectra of HS from
bovine kidney (Sigma), HS
batch HO-01214 from Celsus, and samples of porcine mucosal HS 1 from
our own laboratory, HS-1B and HS-1A21 are
shown in parts a, b, c, and d of Figure 2, respectively. Resonances at 4.37 ppm, consistent
with H1 of either GlcNAc or GlcNS,26 are
seen in the four HS spectra (Figure 2), but signals from IdoA2S are weak in HO-01214. Signals
at 3.38 ppm, attributable to H2 of GlcA, are strong in the HS samples,
though less marked in HO-01214 (Figure 2b). It is not easy to distinguish between N-sulfo and N-unsubstituted glucosamine in the 1H spectrum;27 a prominent peak
at 5.59 ppm in the spectrum of HO-01214 is consistent with nonacetylated
GlcN or GlcNS linked to GlcA.27 The most
obvious difference between HO-01214 and the other two HS spectra lies
in the methyl signal of the acetyl group at about 2.04 ppm. The intensity
of this peak, compared with that of the anomeric and ring proton signals,
is high for the HS spectra in Figure 2a,c,d but weak in the HO-01214 spectrum (Figure 2b). This indicates that the
degree of N-acetylation on the amino sugar is much
lower for HO-01214 than is the case for the other two porcine HS samples. 1H NMR spectra for three preparations of porcine mucosal HS-1C,
prepared as described by Casu et al.,21 and HO-10697 and HO-10095, very old batches from Celsus, are also
shown in Supplemental Figure S3; all of
them contain the same prominent acetyl methyl signal at 2.04 ppm.

Figure 2 1H NMR spectra of different HS preparations: (a) bovine
kidney HS obtained from Sigma; (b) porcine intestinal HS, HO-01214,
obtained from Celsus Laboratories; (c) porcine intestinal HS-1B; and
(d) porcine intestinal HS-1A. ×, Signal from an unidentified
impurity in this sample.

The ratios of IdoA/GlcA for the abnormal HO-01214 and two
other
porcine HS preparations (HS-1B and HO-10095) were calculated based
on the integrated anomeric cross-peaks in their 13C–1H HSQC NMR spectra (Supplemental Figure S4). The ratio of IdoA/GlcA for HO-01214 at 0.7 (Supplemental Table S1) is similar to that of
the two normal porcine HS preparations, HS-1B and HO-10095 (0.6 and
0.9, respectively).

Disaccharide-composition analysis28 was
next carried out to quantitatively assess the content of the free
GlcN in HO-01214 in comparison with three porcine intestinal HS samples,
HS-1A, HO-10095, and HO-10697, together with US Pharmacopeia heparin
and chemically N-desulfated heparin (CNDS) as controls.
The percentages of the 12 potential disaccharide constituents were
obtained (Table 2)
and these include four GlcNAc-containing, 4 GlcNS-containing, and
4 possible GlcN-containing disaccharides. A total of 30% of GlcN was
found in HO-01214, mainly in the form of ΔUA-GlcN (26%) together
with some minor (3.8%) ΔUA(2S)-GlcN(6S). This is very high compared
with the other three porcine intestinal HS, HS-1A, HO-10095, and HO-10697,
(1.6–5.8%) while the content of ΔUA-GlcNAc is extremely
low (1.7%, Table 2)
that is identical to the CNDS.

Table 2 Disaccharide Composition

a GlcNAc-containing: 0S, ΔUA-GlcNAc;
2S, ΔUA(2S)-GlcNAc; 6S, ΔUA-GlcNAc(6S); 2S6S, ΔUA(2S)-GlcNAc(6S).

ΔUA(2S)-GlcN(6S).

d “–”: not detected;
standard deviations are shown in brackets and are based on triplicated
measurements.

It became
clear that the HO-01214 of HS received from Celsus is
very different from all other HS preparations analyzed. The content
of GlcNAc is much below 75% as defined by Celsus in the product information.
The very high content of GlcN and low content of GlcNAc may indicate
a N-deacetylation and/or N-desulfation
procedure has taken place.

The unusual structure feature of
HS HO-01214 identified here could
not simply be a batch-to-batch variation issue. According to the manufacturer’s
product information, HS is a “fraction of crude heparin of
porcine mucosal tissue” and “comprising primarily ΔUA-GlcNAc
(∼75%)”. On the basis of the data obtained from MS sequence
analysis of the oligosaccharide fragments, NMR of the polysaccharide,
and disaccharide composition analysis described above, HO-01214 does
not meet this criterion. NMR spectroscopy also shows that it is considerably
different from other sources of porcine intestinal HS.21,22,27,29

HS prepared by Celsus has been valuable to the scientific
community
in analytical applications to develop methods for chromatography30,31 and sequencing of the complex molecule,32−35 as a standard for quantitation36 and stability studies,37 in biomedical application to investigate its activity to interact
with oligopeptides38,39 and a number of proteins40−42 including growth factors,43,44 endostatin,45,46 and HIV gp120,47 and as controls in the
investigation of HS structural transition in embryonic stem cells.48

Complex polysaccharides isolated from
natural sources offered for
use in research laboratories are not regulated as closely as similar
preparations used in medicine, such as the HS-related compound heparin.49 Manufacturers need to implement careful control
of this complex natural product and care has to be taken by users
in drawing conclusions particularly from investigations of structural
features of HS and specificities of HS-protein interactions when HS
is from a commercial source. Pending the availability of a validated
commercial HS reference preparation, it is hoped that our data will
be useful for members of the scientific community who may have used
the present preparation in biological and biochemical studies.
