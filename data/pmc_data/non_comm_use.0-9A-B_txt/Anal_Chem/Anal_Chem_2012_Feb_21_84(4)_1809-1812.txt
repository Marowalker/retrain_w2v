Metabolomics has become a mainstream analytical strategy
for investigating
metabolism. The quality of data derived from these studies is proportional
to the consistency of the sample preparation. Although considerable
research has been devoted to finding optimal extraction protocols,
most of the established methods require extensive sample handling.
Manual sample preparation can be highly effective in the hands of
skilled technicians, but an automated tool for purifying metabolites
from complex biological tissues would be of obvious utility to the
field. Here, we introduce the semiautomated metabolite batch extraction
device (SAMBED), a new tool designed to simplify metabolomics sample
preparation. We discuss SAMBED’s design and show that SAMBED-based
extractions are of comparable quality to extracts produced through
traditional methods (13% mean coefficient of variation from SAMBED
versus 16% from manual extractions). Moreover, we show that aqueous
SAMBED-based methods can be completed in less than a quarter of the
time required for manual extractions.

==== Body
Metabolomics sample preparation
methods can be divided into three main phases, (1) homogenization,
(2) metabolite extraction, and (3) sample filtration. Each of these
steps plays a direct role in the overall yields and error rates associated
with metabolite isolation from biological tissues. Given the paramount
importance of consistent sample preparation to metabolomics,1−4 surprisingly few tools are available for automating sample preparation
and ensuring consistent metabolite extraction. This is particularly
problematic for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic studies,
which require large sample sizes and substantial volumes of solvents.

Several commercial devices are currently available to automate
sample preparation: the Precellys 24 (Bertin Technologies), gentleMACS
Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec), and Tissuelyser (Qiagen). Furthermore,
recent studies have shown that these devices are effective for medium
to high throughput preparation of metabolite extracts.5−8 However, these devices focus on automating the homogenization process,
whereas the addition of extraction solvents and sample filtration
have not been fully streamlined.

In this report, we introduce
the semiautomated metabolite batch
extraction device (SAMBED). SAMBED is a new tool that supports the
parallel extraction of metabolites from NMR-scale samples. Our goal
in designing SAMBED was to integrate all of the requisite steps of
sample preparation into a single platform while maintaining flexibility
with respect to a range of extraction solvents. Consequently, SAMBED
was constructed from autoclavable materials that are tolerant of both
water and organic solvents and operates effectively at temperatures
ranging from 4 to 100 °C. Our prototype accommodates six parallel
extractions and is designed for processing large samples (0.05–1
g of tissue). Although SAMBED’s scale makes it most appropriate
for NMR-based metabolomics, the design could be rescaled for smaller
samples, such as those used in mass spectrometry.

SAMBED is
composed of six integrated components: (1) milling chamber,
(2) vibrational shaker, (3) solvent reservoir, (4) homogenization
platform, (5) filtration chamber, and (6) filtration platform (Figures 1 and S1–5, Supporting
Information). The system is powered by compressed air supplied
from a conventional air compressor. Biological tissues are placed
in the milling chamber and are homogenized by ball milling in the
vibrational shaker. Our custom milling chamber has a pneumatically
controlled plunger in its base that allows extraction solvents to
be injected directly into the chamber and raw extracts to be transferred
to the downstream filter chambers (Figure S1, Supporting Information). A preallocated volume of extraction
solvent flows from the solvent reservoir into the milling chamber
by gravity. Homogenate is then transferred via the fluid delivery
system to a filtration chamber, where metabolites are separated from
cellular debris and macromolecules by ultrafiltration.Figure 1 Photograph of the major
components of the assembled SAMBED. The
air compressor and vibrational shaker are not shown. For more detailed
photographs of the components, see Figures S1–5 in the Supporting Information.



Experimental Section
Manual Sample Processing
Bovine liver was obtained
from a local grocery store. The liver was frozen, lyophilized, and
aliquoted into 500–600 mg (large samples) or 100–150
mg (small samples) portions. Metabolites were extracted by following
established aqueous9−11 or organic protocols.3,12 Briefly, dry
liver samples (large samples for aqueous extractions and small samples
for organic extractions) were homogenized with a rounded glass rod
and then suspended in either 16 mL of 95 °C deionized water (aqueous
extraction) or 3 mL of −20 °C 40:40:20 Acn/MeOH/H2O (organic extraction). Aqueous extractions were vortexed
and incubated in a 95 °C water bath for 7.5 min and then placed
on ice for 10 min to cool. Organic extractions were vortexed and stored
at 4 °C for 15 min. Following extraction, all samples were vortexed
and centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min (4 °C). Supernatants
from aqueous extracts were transferred to prewashed centrifugal microfilters
(3000 Da cutoff, Sartorius Biolab Products) and centrifuged at 4100
rpm for 10.5 h. The long centrifuge time was necessary for passing
the entire sample through the filter membrane (excluding the 200 μL
dead volume). Supernatants from organic extracts were decanted into
a fresh tube, and the pellet was re-extracted twice with 2 mL of Acn/MeOH/H2O, incubated for 5 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged. Supernatants
from the two organic wash steps were combined with the original extract
to yield a single 7 mL extract from each sample. All metabolite extracts
were frozen, lyophilized, and stored dry at −80 °C until
NMR analysis.

Sample Processing by SAMBED
SAMBED was kept at room
temperature for aqueous extractions and was conducted in a 4 °C
cold room for organic extractions. Lyophilized liver samples (large
and small samples for aqueous extractions and small samples for organic
extractions) were placed in each of the six milling chambers along
with a 1.8 mm diameter grinding ball. Dry samples were milled on the
shaker platform for 30 s, and either 17 mL of 95 °C ddH2O (aqueous extractions) or 8 mL of −20 °C 40:40:20 Acn/MeOH/H2O (organic extractions) were injected from the solvent reservoir
into each chamber. Samples were wet-milled for an additional 30 s.
For aqueous extractions, the homogenization platform was submerged
in a 95 °C water bath for 7.5 min. The homogenization platform
was coupled to the filtration platform, and six filtration chambers
(prechilled for 1 h to 4 °C) containing prewashed ultrafiltration
membranes (3000 Da cutoff, Millipore) were attached. The contents
of each milling chamber were transferred to the downstream filter
chamber under compressed air at 35 psi. The pressure was increased
to 70 psi, and filtration was allowed to progress until most of each
sample had passed through the filtration membrane. Each milling chamber
was flushed with 5 mL of ddH2O, and filtration was allowed
to progress until outflow from the filter chambers ceased. Aqueous
extracts were collected in tubes placed on ice. All metabolite extracts
were frozen, lyophilized, and stored at −80 °C until NMR
analysis.

NMR Analysis
All dry metabolite extracts were dissolved
in 800 μL (large samples) or 200 μL (small samples) of
D2O containing 1 mM 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic
acid (DSS, chemical shift standard) and 500 μM NaN3 (microbial growth inhibitor). The resulting solution was titrated
with concentrated DCl or NaOD as needed to achieve a glass electrode
pH reading of 7.40 ± 0.01. NMR data were collected at the National
Magnetic Resonance Facility at Madison on a 600 MHz Bruker Avance
III spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance (1H, 13C, 15N, 2H lock) 1.7 mm cryogenic probe.
The probe was tuned, matched, and locked to deuterium for the first
sample. Each sample was shimmed, and the 90° pulse width was
determined. A 2D 1H–13C HSQC spectrum
(Bruker sequence hsqcetgpsisp2.2) was then collected for each sample.
Data were processed using custom NMRPipe scripts written in-house.13 Metabolites were identified and quantified using
the rNMR software package following established methods.14,15 Briefly, metabolites were identified by submitting peak lists to
the Madison-Qingdao Metabolomics Consortium Database (MMCD);16 assignments were verified by overlaying NMR
spectra of standards from the BioMagResBank (BMRB).17 Metabolite concentrations were calculated on the basis
of calibration curves from metabolite standards prepared at 2, 5,
and 10 mM. Peak amplitudes used for quantitation were obtained by
fast maximum likelihood reconstruction as implemented in the Newton
software package.18

Statistical Analysis
To measure the relative consistency
of manual versus SAMBED-based preparations, we computed the coefficient
of variation (CV) observed for each metabolite across the 18 replicates
of each sample preparation method. Overall variability was then expressed
as the mean CV associated with each method. All calculations were
performed using the R statistical software program (www.r-project.org).

Results and Discussion
One of the primary motivations
for developing SAMBED was to make
sample preparation more efficient by automating and parallelizing
the metabolite purification process. Consequently, we measured the
time required to prepare 18 samples (three trials of 6 samples each)
via established aqueous9−11 and organic extraction methods.3,12 Sample
preparation times were compared between manual and SAMBED-based extractions
(Table 1). As expected, SAMBED greatly decreased
the time required to prepare samples. SAMBED-derived extracts were
generated in 21% of the time required for manual preparation of aqueous
extracts. Most of the time savings are attributable to the ultrafiltration
step, which is 5 times more efficient by SAMBED because of its large
surface area filters. For organic extractions, SAMBED-based extractions
required slightly more time than manual preparation (81 versus 89
min). However, these times are not directly comparable because the
SAMBED-based organic extractions were subject to microfiltration whereas
the manual sample processing method omitted this step. In contrast
to the centrifugal microfilters, the filter membranes used by SAMBED
are resistant to the Acn/MeOH/H2O solvent used in this
study. Our data show that the additional microfiltration step only
adds ∼10% to the total processing time and comes with the clear
benefit of reduced labor.Table 1 Average Times Required to Prepare

A second motivation for developing SAMBED was
to standardize sample
processing by eliminating manual sample manipulation. To measure SAMBED’s
success in producing consistent metabolite extracts, we measured variations
in 29 metabolite levels observed in 18 liver extracts produced via
traditional versus our new SAMBED-based protocol. Two established
methods, one organic the other aqueous, were evaluated in this study.
For each metabolite, we compared the yields per gram of liver and
the average variability of metabolite levels associated with the different
protocols (Table S1, Supporting Information). As expected, SAMBED-generated extracts were comparable to those
prepared by an experienced technician. Metabolite concentrations observed
in SAMBED extracts were linearly related to those observed in manual
extractions across multiple orders of magnitude (Figure 2). Moreover, the mean CV of metabolites observed in aqueous
SAMBED extracts was 12.3% whereas manual sample preparation resulted
in a mean CV of 13.6% (N = 522). Manual preparation
of organic extracts was the least consistent protocol tested with
a mean CV of 18.1%; this variability was reduced to 14.1% when extracts
were prepared by SAMBED. We attribute the more consistent performance
of the organic SAMBED-based method to the microfiltration step, which
is not possible via the traditional method due to membrane/solvent
incompatibility.Figure 2 Linear relationship of the metabolite levels measured
by manual
or SAMBED processing for (A) aqueous and (B) organic extractions.
SAMBED-derived metabolite levels (N = 522) are plotted
relative to the mean abundance for each metabolite observed in the
manual-derived extracts. The dotted black line indicates the theoretical
ideal regression (slope = 1). In the case of aqueous extractions,
only data from large samples are shown.



Previous research has shown automated sample
preparation is feasible
and can produce consistent results.5−8 Minimizing technical error is a critical
design feature of automated sample preparation tools. The mean CV
values for SAMBED-based extracts reported here (12–14%) compare
favorably to those reported for other automated tools (15–30%).7,8

Conclusions
We have developed and tested SAMBED, a
new device that streamlines
and automates the isolation of metabolites from biological tissues.
SAMBED consistently generates metabolite extracts that are of comparable,
or slightly better, quality than those generated by traditional methods.
Our design allows aqueous extractions to be completed in a fraction
of the time required for manual sample processing, and the materials
used in SAMBED support a wide range of extraction conditions. In summary,
SAMBED simplifies one of the most laborious aspects of metabolomics
studies without affecting data quality. A complete listing of metabolite
levels observed in this study and photographs of SAMBED components
are available in the Supporting Information.
