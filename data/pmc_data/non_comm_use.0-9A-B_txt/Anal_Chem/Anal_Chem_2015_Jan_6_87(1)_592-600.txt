Heparan sulfate (HS) 3-O-sulfation determines
the binding specificity of HS/heparin for antithrombin III and plays
a key role in herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. However, the low
natural abundance of HS 3-O-sulfation poses a serious
challenge for functional studies other than the two cases mentioned
above. By contrast, multiple distinct isoforms of 3-O-sulfotranserases exist in mammals (up to seven isoenzymes). Here
we describe a novel peeling reaction that specifically degrades HS
chains with 3-O-sulfated glucosamine at the reducing-end.
When HS/heparin is enzymatically depolymerized for compositional analysis,
3-O-sulfated glucosamine at the reducing ends appears
to be susceptible to degradation under mildly basic conditions. We
propose a 3-O-desulfation initiated peeling reaction
mechanism based on the intermediate and side-reaction products observed.
Our discovery calls for the re-evaluation of the natural abundance
and functions of HS 3-O-sulfation by taking into
consideration the negative impact of this novel peeling reaction.

==== Body
Heparan sulfate
(HS) is a linear
sulfated polysaccharide that is covalently linked to proteoglycans
core proteins on cell surfaces and in extracellular matrixes. Mostly
through the sulfo groups along its chain, HS binds to a plethora of
protein ligands and is involved in the regulation of a variety of
biological processes including development, angiogenesis, coagulation,
tumor metastasis, and viral infection.1 HS is synthesized in the Golgi apparatus as 1,4-linked repeating
disaccharide units of glucuronic acid (GlcA) residues and N-actetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues, then undergoes a
series of enzyme modifications to form the ligand-binding domains
found in the mature structures. Specifically, the GlcNAc residues
can be selectively de-N-acetylated and N-sulfated; the GlcA residues can be epimerized to iduronic acid (IdoA);
most importantly, sulfo groups can be added by a series of O-sulfotransferases to the 2-O position
of uronic acid residues and the 6-O and 3-O position of the glucosamine residues. The activities of
HS modifying enzymes are controlled by numerous factors and the biosynthetic
reactions are typically incomplete, thus giving rise to mature polysaccharides
consisting of domains of high, low, and intermediate sulfation, overlaid
by heterogeneity of modifications and chain lengths.2

Among all the HS modifications, 3-O-sulfation
is considered to be the last step and comprises only 0.5% of the total
sulfation.3−6 However, the 3-O-sulfo groups are essential modifications
that determine the activity of HS/heparin in a number of biological
and pharmacological processes, including the anticoagulant activation
of antithrombin by heparin7−9 and HS mediated herpes simplex
virus (HSV) attachment to host-cell and viral entry.10−12 It is also implicated in the binding of FGF and FGF receptors,13−15 epithelial-mesenchymal transition inducing,16 and kal-1 dependent neurite branching.17 Given the unusually low natural abundance of the HS 3-O-sulfation, it is intriguing that as many as seven 3-O-sulfotransferase (Hs3st) isoforms have been identified in mammals,
making them the largest family of HS modification enzymes.18,19 Previous studies show that the Hs3st genes are
regulated both spatially and temporally in different types of cells
or tissues, suggesting in vivo functional differences
exist between members of this family.20 It has been further hypothesized that each of Hs3sts creates HS
domains with distinct functions.21 However,
other than the involvement of 3-O-sulfation in the
anticoagulant activation of antithrombin and HSV viral entry, the
structure and function of the Hs3st isozyme specific HS domains remain
largely unknown.19 One of the major roadblocks
preventing detailed analysis of such HS domains is the apparent rarity
of HS 3-O-sulfation.

The peeling reaction is
a base-catalyzed elimination reaction,
resulting in the stepwise loss of the monosaccharide residue from
the reducing-end of carbohydrate polymers. Peeling reactions contribute
to the degradation of oligosaccharides released from glycopeptides
and glycoproteins using hydrozinolysis or β-elimination.22−25 The degradation is the most facile for reducing-end monosaccharides
substituted at the 3-position, due to loss of the substituent (Scheme 1). 1,4-Linked glycans need harsh conditions to induce
structural rearrangements before undergoing peeling reactions.26,27 Because the HS copolymer is comprised of 1,4-linked repeating disaccharide
units, the degree of peeling under alkaline conditions used in sample
processing and workup has not been a concern in the field. However,
because of the complexity of HS, HS samples are often analyzed after
being depolymerized by bacterial heparin lyases.28 Although the optimum digestion pH of these lyases is 7.0–7.5,28 reductive amination is often performed subsequently
to increase saccharide hydrophobicity29 or charges in electrophoresis30−32 and to add a chromophore or fluorophore,33−35,71 exposing the lyase products to
the alkaline conditions introduced by primary amine and reducing reagents.
The susceptibility of different HS saccharides under these milder
basic conditions has never been either noticed or assessed.

Scheme 1 General
Peeling Reaction Mechanism of 1,3-Linked Glycans
Here, we report that when 3-O-sulfated HS glucosamine
is present at the reducing-end of HS saccharides produced by polysaccharide
lyase, a peeling reaction will occur under mildly basic conditions.
We propose that the reaction first causes the desulfation at the 3-position
of the glucosamine followed by the loss of the glucosamine monosaccharide.
The reaction is obviously accelerated by an unintended increase in
either pH or temperature. Because of this 3-O-sulfation
specific peeling reaction, there is concern that previously reported
abundances of HS 3-O-sulfation in lyase-generated
saccharides may have underestimated its biological abundance.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
Porcine intestinal mucosa (PIM) heparan sulfate
(HS) was purchased from Celsus Laboratories, Inc. (Cincinnati, OH).
Heparin lyase I from Flavbacterium heparinum was
purchased from Iduron (Manchester, U.K.). Fondaparinux (GlcNS6S-GlcA-GlcNS3S6S-IdoA2S-GlcNS6S-Me,
C31H43N3Na10O49S8) was purchased from Organon Sanofi-Synthelabo LLC (West
Orange, NJ). Fondaparinux was prepared by dialysis using a 100 Da
molecular weight cutoff membrane filter before LC–MS analysis.
Enoxaparin was from Sanofi prefilled injection syringe (30 mg/0.3
mL). PAPS was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Hs3st-1 was obtained from
R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN. Synthetic HS tetrasaccharide was
prepared as previously described.36

Preparing
Size-Defined HS Oligosaccharides
PIM HS (∼50
mg) was digested using heparin lyase I distributively in a small volume
and then separated by a gel filtration column. Briefly, 50 mg of HS
was dissolved in digestion buffer (100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 1
mM Ca(OAc)2, pH 7.4) and divided into five 400 μL
aliquots, to each of which were added 50 mU of heparin lyase I, and
digested at 37 °C for 3 h. The digestion products were then combined
and applied onto a 1.5 cm × 170 cm Bio-Rad Econo Column packed
with Bio-Rad P-10 gel (fine beads, particle size 45–90 μm,
separation range 1 500–20 000 Da) equilibrated
with 100 mM NH4HCO3. The flow rate was set at
0.05 mL/min, and the effluent was monitored by UV at 232 nm. The fractions
corresponding to the same chromatographic peak from the UV profile
were pooled and vacuum-dried twice to remove the remaining ammonium
bicarbonate.

HS Compositional Analysis Using Hydrophilic
Interaction Liquid
Chromatography–mass Spectrometry (HILIC–MS)
The compositions of oligosaccharides of tetrasaccharide or greater
sizes were analyzed by chip-based Amide-80 chromatography with MS
detection as previously described.37−41

Separation of HS Oligosaccharides by Strong
Anion Exchange (SAX)
Chromatography
Approximately 30 nmol of size-fractioned HS
oligosaccharides were further separated using an IonPac AS7 column
(4.6 mm × 250 mm, Thermo Scientific) using a previously described
method.72 The mobile phase used were A,
H2O (pH 3.5 by HCl); B, 2 M NaCl (pH 3.5 by HCl). A Beckman
Gold HPLC system was used to deliver a linear gradient as follows:
1–10 min, 0% B, 10–70 min, 0–100% B; 85–90
min, 100–0% B. The effluents were detected by UV at 232 nm
and chromatographic peaks were collected and desalted using a PD MiniTrap
G-10 desalting cartridge (GE Health, Piscataway, NJ) for further analysis.

Electron Detachment Dissociation (EDD) Analysis of HS Oligosaccharides
Desalted HS oligosaccharide was subject to electrostatic nanospray
on a 12 T solariX hybrid Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance
(FTICR) mass spectrometry system (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany).
The EDD experiment was carried out as previously described.42−44

Hs3st Modification of Synthetic HS Tetrasaccharide Substrates
The enzymatic modification of synthetic tetrasaccharides by Hs3st
was carried out using a protocol modified from our previous publication.26 Each reaction consists of 0.01 μg/uL synthetic
tetrasaccharide, 0.004 μg/uL Hs3st-1, 0.16 mM PAPS, 50 mM MOPS,
pH 7.0, 2.5 mM MnCl2, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1.25 mM
CaCl2, 0.01% BSA, in ∼50 μL volume. After
incubation at 37 °C for overnight (∼16 h), the modified
tetrasaccharide was separated from proteins and salts on a Superdex
Peptide PC 3.2/30 column (GE Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) equilibrated
with 100 mM NH4HCO3.

pH-Dependent Lyase Digestion
of the Fondaparinux Pentasaccharide
and the Synthetic Tetrasaccharide
A 1 nmol quantity of fondaparinux
pentasaccharide was incubated with 10 mU heparin lyase I in a 50 μL
reaction buffered by either 50 mM NaOAc, pH 6.0 or 50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.0 or 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, in the presence of 1 mM Ca(OAc)2 and 0.1% BSA, at 37 °C overnight. A 0.2 μg quantity
of the synthetic tetrasaccharides (with or without Hs3st modification)
was digested by a mixture of 10 mU heparin lyase I and heparin lyase
II in a similar way.

Testing the Base Susceptibility of Purified
HS Oligosaccharides
A 1 nmol quantity of purified HS oligosaccharides
were vacuum-dried
and resuspended in either 0.1 M NH3·H2O,
pH ∼11.0, or 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The reactions were incubated
at 37 °C overnight and vacuum-dried again to remove excess NH3·H2O.

Preparation of Lyase-Resistant
Enoxaparin Tetrasaccharides
The enoxaparin was obtained from
the Lovenox injection syringe.
A total of ∼100 μg of enoxaparin was digested by a mixture
of heparin lyase I, II, and III (10 mU each) in a digestion buffer
consisting of 50 mM NaOAc, pH 6.0, 1 mM Ca(OAc)2, and 0.1%
BSA. After incubation at 37 °C overnight, the digestion products
were fractionated using a Superdex Peptide PC 3.2/30 column (GE Biosciences,
Piscataway, NJ) equilibrated with 100 mM NH4HCO3. The chromatographic peak corresponding to tetrasaccharide was collected
as the lyase-resistant tetrasaccharides and vacuum-dried immediately
to avoid unwanted degradation.

Analysis of HS Oligosaccharides
Using Size Exclusion Chromatography–Mass
Spectrometry (SEC–MS)
The digestion products of HS
tetrasaccharides and pentasaccharides by heparin lyases were analyzed
using size exclusion chromatography (SEC)–mass spectrometry
as previously described.45

Reductive-Amination
Labeling of HS Oligosaccharides
A 1 nmol quantity of 3-O-sulfate containing hexasaccharide
[1,2,3,1,7] was vacuum-dried and resuspended in 10 μL of labeling
reagent mixture consisting of 0.8 M sodium cyanoborohydride and 0.5
M n-butylamine dissolved in a varying ratio of AcOH
and DMSO (v/v = 1:1, 3:7, and 1:9). The reactions were incubated at
65 °C for 3 h. The reaction products were then desalted by PD
MiniTrap G-10 cartridges and vacuum-dried.

Nomenclature and Data Analysis
HS oligosaccharide compositions
are given as [ΔHexA,HexA,GlcN,Ac,SO3] (ΔHexA,
4,5-unsaturated hexuronic acid; HexA, hexuronic acid; GlcN, glucosamine;
Ac, acetate; SO3, sulfate), denoting the number of the
corresponding residues. Fragment ions from tandem MS are labeled using
the conventional carbohydrate fragmentation nomenclature46 with HS specific modifications. Specifically,
HS structures without modification of sulfation (S) and/or acetylation
(Ac) are named as the backbone followed by the modifications in parentheses,
such as 0,2X2 (1Ac, 2S) and Y1 (3S).

Results and Discussion
Discovery of a Base-Sensitive HS Oligosaccharide
As
we were profiling the compositions of a size-fractioned HS hexasaccharide
sample prepared by depolymerizing the commercial porcine intestine
mucosa HS (HSPIM) using heparin lyase I, we identified abundant HS
pentasaccharides with the composition of [1,2,2,1,4] (HS oligosaccharide
compositions are given as [ΔHexA,HexA,GlcN,Ac,SO3], denoting the number of the corresponding residues and modifications)
(Figure 1). Because of the repeating disaccharide
units in the HS chains, the finding of such pentasaccharides with
one glucosamine residue missing is unusual. Although odd-numbered
oligosaccharide may result from the endogenous activity of mammalian
heparanase,47,48 we did not detect a comparable
amount of odd-numbered oligosaccharide with the composition of [0,2,3,X,Y],
which would be simultaneously produced on the reducing-end side of
the heparanase cleavage sites. We therefore suspected an unnatural
source of the [1,2,2,1,4] pentasaccharides. Since the mobile phase
used in size-fractioning the HS oligosaccharides consists of 100 mM
ammonium bicarbonate, which had a slightly alkaline pH (∼8.0),
we hypothesized that the [1,2,2,1,4] pentasaccharide could be a base-catalyzed
degradation product from a [1,2,3,X,Y] hexasaccharide. To test this
hypothesis, we incubated the HS oligosaccharide fraction with 0.1
M ammonium hydroxide (pH ∼11.0) and profiled the HS compositions
before and after the incubation (Figure 1B).
The results demonstrated that the elevated pH increased the abundance
of the [1,2,2,1,4] pentasaccharide in the fraction. The results further
revealed that the increase of the pentasaccharide was accompanied
by a sharp decrease in the abundance of highly sulfated hexasaccharides,
predominately in the composition of [1,2,3,1,7], suggesting that the
unusual pentasaccharide [1,2,2,1,4] might be a base-catalyzed degradation
product of the [1,2,3,1,7] hexasaccharide.

hexasaccharide [1,2,3,1,7] in
the MS profiling of the size-fractioned HS oligosaccharide profiles:
(A) SEC fractionation of HS oligosaccharides obtained from limited
lyase digestion of HSPIM and (B) composition profiles of the hexasaccharide
fraction with and without NH3·H2O treatment.
An unusual HS pentasaccharide with the composition of [1,2,2,1,4]
was identified and found to be a base-catalyzed degradation product
of a hexasaccharide with the composition of [1,2,3,1,7].

In order to purify base-sensitive hexasaccharide
[1,2,3,1,7], we
subjected the hexasaccharide fraction to further separation by strong
anion exchange chromatography (SAX) as shown in Figure 2A. Individual chromatographic peaks corresponding to highly
sulfated saccharides were desalted separately and analyzed by HILIC–MS.
We observed the composition [1,2,3,1,7] in both peaks I and II. However,
treatment of fractions I and II with basic conditions showed that
only the [1,2,3,1,7] from the peak II was degraded into [1,2,2,1,4]
in a pH-dependent manner (Figure 2B). In the
absence of the additional base treatment, peak II underwent degradation
to a small extent. When treated with pH 8.0 tris buffer, more than
half of the [1,2,3,1,7] was converted into [1,2,2,1,4]. When treated
with 0.1 M ammonium hydroxide (pH ∼11.0), nearly all [1,2,3,1,7]
was degraded to [1,2,2,1,4], indicating the [1,2,3,1,7] isomer in
peak II underwent the observed degradation described in Figure 1.

from
size-fractioned HS oligosaccharides: (A) SAX chromatogram of the size-fractioned
HS hexasaccharides. The composition [1,2,3,1,7] was found in peaks
I and II. (B) Degradation of the hexasaccharide [1,2,3,1,7] from peak
II under basic conditions. The hexasaccharide [1,2,3,1,7] from peak
II to either control (ddH2O) or basic conditions (Tris-HCl,
pH8.0, or 0.1 M NH3·H2O) treatment. The
products were analyzed on HILIC–MS. The base peak chromatograms
(BPCs) showed that the hexasaccharide [1,2,3,1,7] (peak b) was converted
into pentasaccharide [1,2,2,1,4] (peak a) under basic conditions.

We next characterized the structure
of the [1,2,3,1,7] isomer in
the SAX fractions using tandem mass spectrometry and discovered that
it contains a N,3,6-sulfated glucosamine (GlcNS3S6S)
at its reducing-end (Supplemental Figure 1 in the Supporting Information). As the degradation of the hexasaccharide
[1,2,3,1,7] to the pentasaccharide [1,2,2,1,4] resulted in the loss
of a glucosamine residue together with three sulfo groups, it appears
that the GlcNS3S6S residue at the reducing-end of the hexasaccharide
[1,2,3,1,7] was lost in this degradation reaction.

Reducing-End
3-O-Sulfation Required for the
Peeling Reaction
Because the degradation reaction is apparently
catalyzed by mildly basic conditions and specific to the structure
of the hexasaccharide [1,2,3,1,7] we characterized, we first hypothesized
that this is a novel peeling reaction that is specific to the GlcNS3S6S
residues at the reducing-end. In order to test this hypothesis, we
took advantage of the synthetic heparin pentasaccharide fondaparinux,
which has the GlcNS3S6S residue in its sequence (GlcNS6S-GlcA-GlcNS3S6S-IdoA2S-GlcNS6S-Me).
Digesting this synthetic pentasaccharide with heparin lyase I releases
the GlcNS3S6S residue to the reducing-end of the trisaccharide product
GlcNS6S-GlcA-GlcNS3S6S (Figure 3). We then
tested if lyase I treatment of fondaparinux at various pH conditions
would cause the degradation of the particular trisaccharide. As expected,
we observed two chromatographic products at pH 6.0 and 7.0, corresponding
to the intact disaccharide product (peak b) and the trisaccharide
product (peak a). However, at pH 8.0, an additional product (peak
c) with the mass corresponding to GlcNS6SHexA appeared as the abundance
of the trisaccharide (peak a) decreased at the same time, consistent
with the degradation of the trisaccharide GlcNS6S-GlcA-GlcNS3S6S into
disaccharide GlcNS6S-GlcA. This result suggests that the peeling reaction
we discovered is not a unique reaction specific to the hexasaccharide
[1,2,3,1,7] and applies to other HS oligosaccharides with GlcNS3S6S
residues at the reducing-end.

Figure 3 Digestion of heparin pentasaccharide fondaparinux
by heparin lyase
I at different pH conditions. The lyase products were analyzed using
SEC–MS, and the total ion chromatograms (TICs) demonstrated
the conversion of the trisaccharide digestion product (peak a) into
disaccharide degradation product (peak c) at pH 8.0. The structures
of peak a, b, and c were determined by their masses.

We next tested the necessity of the 3-O-sulfation
for the proposed peeling reaction. A tetrasaccharide with the sequence
of GlcA-GlcNS-IdoA2S-GlcNS6S-R (R = (CH2)5NH2) was chosen from a previously published synthetic HS oligosaccharide
library36 and modified at the GlcNS residue
with recombinant Hs3st-1 (Supplemental Figure 2 in the Supporting Information). After the enzymatic
reaction, both the synthetic tetrasaccharide substrate and the Hs3st
product were digested with heparin lyase I at different pHs. As shown
in Figure 4, lyase I digestion of the control
tetrasaccharide produced GlcA-GlcNS and IdoA2S-GlcNS6S-R as identified
using SEC–MS, both of which remained stable at elevated pH.
Similarly, the Hs3st-1 modified tetrasaccharide produced the 3-O-sulfation containing GlcA-GlcNS3S and IdoA2S-GlcNS6S-R
after lyase I digestion at pH 6.0. However, when the Hs3st-1 modified
tetrasaccharide was digested at pH 8.0, the 3-O-sulfated
product diminished on the chromatograph, demonstrating that the newly
formed GlcA-GlcNS3S was indeed susceptible to degradation under mildly
basic conditions. Therefore, by directly comparing the susceptibility
of GlcA-GlcNS and GlcA-GlcNS3S, we proved that 3-O-sulfation is necessary for the novel peeling reaction we discovered.
Since the disaccharide GlcA-GlcNS3S does not contain 6-O-sulfation, 6-O-sulfation is apparently not necessary
for the degradation to occur.

Figure 4 Digestion of synthetic (A) and Hs3st-1 modified
(B) tetrasaccharide
at different pH conditions. The lyase products were analyzed using
SEC–MS, and the total ion chromatograms (TICs) demonstrated
the 3-O-sulfation dependent degradation of the disaccharide
product (peak b) at pH 8.0.

Proposed Mechanism
As this reducing-end 3-O-sulfation specific peeling reaction is both unprecedented and in
sharp contrast to the traditional notion about the stability of 1,4
linked reducing end monosaccharides against peeling reactions, we
investigated the mechanism of this reaction. Two new ions appeared
in the extracted mass spectra of the peeling reaction products of
the Hs3st-1 modified tetrasaccharide: m/z 416.05 and 434.06 (Supplemental Figure 3 in the Supporting Information). The ion at m/z 416.05 drew our attention because (1) this mass matched
with that of GlcA-GlcNS3S with a loss of one water molecule (H2O) and one sulfo group (−SO3), (2) The SEC
elution time of this ion was greater than that of GlcA-GlcNS3S, indicating
that m/z 416.05 did not result from
loss of SO3 from GlcA-GlcNS3S during ionization (Supplemental
Figure 3 in the Supporting Information).
We reasoned that loss of 3-O-sulfation could have
occurred in a manner similar to that of peeling observed for mucin-type
GalNAc saccharides with 3-substituents (Scheme 1). This elimination would create a double bond at the C2–C3
position of the glucosamine, which further set the stage for the elimination
(peeling) at the C-4 position as the C-2 -NH- group gets deprotonated
at basic conditions (Scheme 2A). This proposed
two-step mechanism would explain the observed specificity of this
novel peeling reaction to 3-O-sulfated glucosamine
residues, as the elimination of the 3-O-sulfation
is required for the peeling step.

In the proposed mechanism
(Scheme 2A), the newly formed ion at m/z of 434.06 had the mass of the 3-O-desulfated intermediate product 3 plus one
water molecule (H2O). We reasoned that this product could
be formed by Michael addition of a hydroxyl group to the 3 position
under basic conditions (Scheme 2B). Therefore,
the observation of the side product 5 supported the two-step
peeling reaction proposed in Scheme 2A. Importantly,
a similar side product was also observed in the peeling reaction of
the hexasaccharide [1,2,3,1,7] (Supplemental Figure 4 in the Supporting Information).

Impact of the Peeling Reaction on the Analysis of HS 3-O-Sulfation
We tested the extent to which this
novel peeling reaction affects the determination of the abundance
of 3-O-sulfation under routine analysis conditions
for HS oligosaccharides. It has been established that the glycosidic
bond to the nonreducing side of the 3-O-sulfation
containing disaccharide unit is resistant to the depolymerization
by heparin lyases.21,49−56 Therefore, exhaustive depolymerization of 3-O-sulfation
containing HS/heparin by heparin lyases will generate lyase-resistant
HS tetrasaccharides that have GlcNS3S6S at the reducing-ends. As the
3-O-sulfation content is necessary for anticoagulation
activity of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), manufacturers of
LMWH use the abundances of the lyase-resistant, 3-O-sulfation containing tetrasaccharides to gauge product quality.57 We therefore tested the extent to which lyase-resistant
LMWH tetrasaccharides are prone to the 3-O-sulfation
specific peeling reaction. We digested the LMWH enoxaparin exhaustively
using heparin lyases, isolated the resistant tetrasaccharides from
the products, and treated them with pH 8.0 Tris-HCl buffer. As shown
in Figure 5, the abundances of the tetrasaccharide
compositions [1,1,2,1,4] and [1,1,2,1,3], which were previously shown
to be the major 3-O-sulfated lyase-resistant tetrasaccharides
from enoxaparin,58 decreased significantly
after the treatment. In addition, a new peak was observed at m/z 634.0, corresponding to the trisaccharide
composition [1,1,1,1,1]. The results showed that the lyase-resistant
tetrasaccharide compositions [1,1,2,1,4] and [1,1,2,1,3] were converted
to the trisaccharide composition [1,1,1,1,1] at slightly basic conditions,
losing one glucosamine residue with three and two sulfo groups, respectively.
Since these lyase-resistant tetrasaccharide from enoxaparin had 3-O-sulfated glucosamine residues at the reducing-ends, these
results suggested they were prone to the 3-O-sulfation
specific peeling reaction. Our discovery therefore raised concern
about the degradation of the lyase-resistant tetrasaccharides from
LMWH due to alkaline storage/analysis conditions.

Figure 5 Susceptibility of lyase-resistant
tetrasaccharides from enoxaparin
to the 3-O-sulfation specific peeling reaction. Purified
enoxaparin tetrasaccharides were subjected to either control (ddH2O) or basic condition (Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) treatment. The products
were analyzed using SEC–MS. Peak a, the combined extracted
ion chromatograms (EICs) of previously reported lyase-resistant tetrasaccharides
from enoxaparin; peak b, the EIC of a trisaccharide resulted from
the 3-O-sulfation specific peeling reaction of the
tetrasaccharides.

We then considered widely
used analytical methods that might cause
this unwanted reaction. One common practice in analyzing HS/heparin
oligosaccharides is reductive-amination to add chromophore groups
for optical detection for chromatography33−35,71 or capillary electrophoresis29−32 or to add stable isotope labels
for MS studies.33,59−62 For analysis of HS, reductive
amination using anthranilic acid analogues,59,60 2-aminoacridone,35 aniline33 entail use of acetic acid, a large excess of
the primary amine, and the reducing reagent NaBH3CN.63,64 Hyadrazide labeling using BODIPY uses similar conditions without
the reducing agent.34,65,66 In order to evaluate the extent to which typical reducing end labeling
conditions induce the 3-O-sulfation specific peeling
reaction, we used the 3-O-sulfation containing hexasaccharide
[1,2,3,1,7] under a series of solution conditions with respect to
concentration of acetic acid. As expected, at commonly used labeling
conditions (AcOH/DMSO = 3:7), we found that ∼36% of starting
saccharide was converted to the peeling reaction product [1,2,2,1,4]
with loss of the reducing end GlcNS3S6S residue (Figure 6). The degree of peeling scaled inversely with the acetic
acid concentration. Using AcOH/DMSO = 1:1, we observed >90% of
the
labeled 3-O-sulfation containing hexasaccharide (Figure 6). In conclusion, the results indicated that the
3-O-sulfation specific peeling reaction takes place
under commonly used reductive-amination conditions and raising the
acetic acid concentration in the reaction would help to maintain the
3-O-sulfated substrate labeled in its intact form.

Figure 6 Labeling
the 3-O-sulfation containing hexasaccharide
[1,2,3,1,7] at different acetic acid concentrations. The desalted
products were analyzed on HILIC–MS. Peak a, EIC of pentasaccharide
degradation product labeled with butylamine; peak b, the EIC of the
intact hexasaccharide [1,2,3,1,7] labeled with butylamine; BA, butylamine.

Our results suggest that effort
should be made to maintain pH conditions
below neutral during purification and workup of HS saccharides from
polysaccharide lyase digests. One way to avoid problems is to use
methods that do not require reducing end derivatization. Our group
has used HILIC–MS in the present work and elsewhere. Other
groups have used reversed phase ion paring.67,68 In recent work, a reversed phase ion pairing mobile phase pH of
6.5 was used for the analysis of lyase-resistant, 3-O-sulfated tetrasaccharides in heparins using LC–MS.69

Conclusions
In this study, we discovered
a novel peeling reaction that specifically
degrades HS oligosaccharides that contain 3-O-sulfated
glucosamine residue at the reducing-ends. We proposed that this specificity
likely resulted from a de-3-O-sulfation initiated,
two-step peeling reaction mechanism. Because of the high degree of
heterogeneity, naturally existing HS/heparin are often analyzed after
exhaustive or partial depolymerization by bacterial heparin lyases.
Consequently, the 3-O-sulfated glucosamine residues
are present at the reducing-end of lyase product saccharides during
the analysis and become susceptible to this peeling reaction. As demonstrated
in the paper, the 3-O-sulfation specific peeling
reaction occurs under much milder conditions than the traditional
types of peeling reactions that occur to 4-linked reducing terminal
residues.26,27 This raises the possibility that unintentional
peeling reactions occur during chemical and/or enzymatic reactions,
chromatography, and sample storage. In our tests, factors such as
unintentional pH and temperature increases could very easily accelerate
the peeling reaction (Figures 3 and 4 and Supplemental Figure 5 in the Supporting Information). For example, a boiling procedure
was carried out to inactivate the lyases in one of the previous studies
assessing the 3-O-sulfation content in human follicular
fluid HS, which could have potentially degraded some of the 3-O-sulfated saccharides.70 Another
concern is the reductive-amination based labeling, as it is widely
used in a variety of analytical methods for HS di- and oligo-saccharides.
Acetic acid is often used in these reactions to open the reducing-end
sugar ring, but an excess amount of acetic acid is also avoided both
to keep some of the reacting amine in unprotonated form and to prevent
the loss of sulfate groups. In our study, the amount of acetic acid
used in common reductive amination reactions (AcOH/DMSO = 3:7) are
often not enough to counterbalance the alkaline conditions introduced
by primary amine and reducing reagents, which leads to the loss of
the reducing-end 3-O-sulfated glucosamine through
the peeling reaction mechanism we discovered. It has been previously
reported that 3-O-sulfation changes the susceptibility
of glucosamine residues to nitrous acid, another popular method to
depolymerize HS chains for compositional analysis.19,54 Taken together, our results suggest that the natural abundances
of 3-O-sulfation might need to be reassessed.
