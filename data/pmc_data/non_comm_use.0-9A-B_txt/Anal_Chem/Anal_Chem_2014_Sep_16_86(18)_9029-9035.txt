Point-of-care detection of pathogens
is medically valuable but
poses challenging trade-offs between instrument complexity and clinical
and analytical sensitivity. Here we introduce a diagnostic platform
utilizing lithographically fabricated micron-scale forms of cubic
retroreflectors, arguably one of the most optically detectable human
artifacts, as reporter labels for use in sensitive immunoassays. We
demonstrate the applicability of this novel optical label in a simple
assay format in which retroreflector cubes are first mixed with the
sample. The cubes are then allowed to settle onto an immuno-capture
surface, followed by inversion for gravity-driven removal of nonspecifically
bound cubes. Cubes bridged to the capture surface by the analyte are
detected using inexpensive, low-numerical aperture optics. For model
bacterial and viral pathogens, sensitivity in 10% human serum was
found to be 104 bacterial cells/mL and 104 virus
particles/mL, consistent with clinical utility.

Detection
of pathogenic organisms
traditionally has relied on culture and microscopic observation.1,2 Techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunofluorescence
(IF) assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), have more
recently emerged as important methods for detection of pathogens.
While highly effective, these methods are largely confined to laboratory
settings, require trained personnel and can involve considerable time
and expense.1−8

With the improvement of microfabrication technology, many
advances
have been made in the development of point of care (POC) diagnostics,
particularly in microfluidic devices integrating sample processing
and detection into a single device.9−11 Sophisticated methods
have been developed for DNA amplification and analysis,9,12−14 cytometry,15−18 whole-organism assays,19−21 and protein detection.22−25 These methods generally rely upon labels such as colored nano- and
microparticles, magnetic particles, fluorescent molecules, and liposomes,
which can be affected by issues such as photobleaching of fluors and
particle stability in the complex sample matrices often used in a
POC environment.26−28

Here, we demonstrate the detection of model
bacterial and viral
pathogens, Escherichia coli and MS2 virus at 104 bacterial cells/mL and 104 virions/mL, respectively,
using suspended, microfabricated retroreflector cubes as optical labels
conjugated to antibodies. Retroreflectors are widely used on bicycles,
traffic signs,29 and safety vests30 because of their high detectability. They return
incident light in a narrow beam directly back to the illumination
source and, therefore, are significantly brighter than surfaces that
scatter light. Our group has previously reported the initial fabrication
of retroreflector cubes;31 this paper,
however, reports a significantly improved fabrication process and
a novel assay concept, demonstrating for the first time, the use of
micron-scale retroreflectors in immunoassays. The assay is otherwise
based on simple, commercially available materials and requires little
or no sample preparation and no exposure to the potentially infectious
sample after sample collection. The retroreflector cubes, 5 μm
on a side, possess a transparent epoxy core and three mutually perpendicular
reflective gold-coated surfaces. Individual cubes are easily detected
using a low-cost, low-numerical aperture camera objective, suggesting
the possibility of using the cameras of mobile phones with only the
addition of a plastic lens and an inline light source. Their highly
reflective nature greatly facilitates detection, and photobleaching
and storage stability are not concerns with these labels.

In
the present assay (detailed in Assay Procedure), a premixed sample is introduced into an in-house-modified qPCR
tube, the cap of which is conjugated on its (optical-quality) inner
surface with antibodies to the target. The tubes are inverted to allow
the dense cubes to settle; any analyte present is captured and bridges
the antibody-modified cube onto the antibody-coated cap inner surface.
The test vessel is then turned upright after applying a fluidic force
discrimination step by pulsing on a vortex mixer to remove weakly
bound cubes, and bound retroreflectors are counted using a low numerical
aperture camera with inline illumination.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
Optical qPCR tubes (8× strip, catalog
no. 401428) and separate caps (8× strip, catalog no. 401425)
were obtained from Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA). Rabbit
polyclonal anti-E. coli antibodies were obtained
from Fitzgerald (Acton, MA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-MS2 antibodies
were obtained from Tetracore (Rockville, MD). E. coli (strain MB1457), and bacteriophage MS2 (strain 15597-B1) were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) tablets (10 mM Phosphate, 2.7 mM potassium chloride,
140 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.4) were purchased from Bioline (Taunton,
MA). Anonymized human serum was obtained from the Gulf Coast Regional
Blood Center (Houston, TX). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was
obtained from Pierce (Rockford, IL). 1-Ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)
carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), N-hydroxysuccinimide
(NHS), bovine serum albumin (BSA), Tween-20, hydroxylamine, 6-mercapto-1-hexanol,
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), anhydrous chromium trioxide, 96.7% sulfuric
acid, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP), and sodium cyanoborohydride
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

Fabrication
of Polypropylene Test Vessel and Preparation of
Polypropylene Observation Window
A detailed description of
the modification of the qPCR tube test vessels can be found in the Supporting Information (section S1). The final
design was optimized to prevent the presence of air bubbles, which
can sweep away bound particles by surface tension.23,32

The as-purchased, optical-quality qPCR tube caps, with 3 mm
diameter, transparent observation windows, are not optimized for protein
adsorption; antibodies, therefore, were covalently attached by the
following method. The caps were first cleaned by bath sonication in
anhydrous ethanol for 15 min, and then immersed for 1 min in 29:42:29
(w/w/w) concentrated sulfuric acid, distilled water and chromium trioxide
at 70 °C.33,34 After oxidation, the carboxylated
caps were washed extensively with deionized water purified with a
Milli-Q system (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and anhydrous ethanol,
and then dried under a stream of nitrogen.

Activation of Carboxylated
Observation Window and Immobilization
of Antibodies
The carboxylated qPCR tube caps were activated
by incubation with 3 mM EDC and 5 mM NHS in 0.1 M MES buffer, pH 6.0
for 15 min at room temperature, then washed with PBS. Rabbit anti-E. coli antibodies (1 mg/mL in 10 mM PBS, pH 7.4) or rabbit
anti-MS2 antibodies (1 mg/mL in 10 mM PBS, pH 7.4) were covalently
attached to the caps by spotting 10 μL of antibody solution
on the activated observation window and incubating at 4 °C, overnight.
The tube caps were then washed with PBST (10 mM PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1%
Tween-20), and passivated by incubation with a 2% BSA, 100 mM hydroxylamine
solution for 3 h. The conjugated caps were then washed with PBS and
passivated by adsorption of 2% BSA for 3 h at room temperature.

Fabrication of Retroreflector Cubes and Immobilization of Antibodies
Retroreflector cubes were fabricated using a modification of a
process previously reported31 (detailed
process and schematic shown in section S2, Figure S2, Supporting Information). Briefly, a 5 μm
thick layer of SU-8 5 photoresist was deposited onto a copper-coated
silicon wafer by spin-coating at 2000 rpm for 1 min. The coated wafer
was baked on a hot plate at 95 °C for 3 min, cross-linked via
exposure to 254 nm UV irradiation, then baked once more to cure the
epoxy-based resist. A 200 nm layer of copper was then deposited onto
the wafer by thermal evaporation followed by spin-coating a 70 nm
layer of polystyrene.

An array of squares defining individual
cubic retroreflectors was next printed using an in-house ion beam
proximity lithography tool, and the polystyrene developed in a toluene
bath. The copper layer under the polystyrene was isotropically etched
using a copper etchant and the pattern then transferred into the SU-8
layer using an oxygen reactive ion etching process. Citric acid solution
was used to etch the final copper layer, leaving an undercut. A 10
nm titanium layer and a 100 nm gold layer were then evaporated at
an angle relative the surface normal to coat only three of the optically
transparent SU-8 surfaces. The cubes, possessing three gold sides
and three SU-8 sides, were released by immersion in citric acid solution
to remove the remaining copper and subsequently recovered by centrifugation
at 5000 × g for 5 min. Following wash and resuspension steps,
the cubes were diluted to 1.5 × 107/mL in PBS and
stored at 4 °C for subsequent experiments. It should be noted
that water is a weak nucleophile whose reaction with epoxides proceeds
at appreciable rates under highly acidic conditions (<pH 4) or
at elevated temperatures (>70 °C).35 It was, therefore, imperative either to functionalize the cubes
immediately, or to store the particles at low temperatures and neutral
pH to retard hydrolysis.

To preferentially functionalize the
free SU-8 sides of the cubes,
the particles were incubated with 10 mM glycine in 100 mM PBS at pH
9.0 for 1 h to allow the covalent attachment of primary amines to
the exposed epoxy groups on the cubes,36 leaving behind carboxyl moieties. The glycine-functionalized cubes
were then incubated for 1 h with 100 mM 6-mercapto-1-hexanol in 20:80
(v/v) DMSO in PBS to form a hydroxyl-terminated self-assembled monolayer
on the exposed gold surfaces (Figure 1). The
self-assembled monolayer provides a degree of passivation by reducing
protein adsorption to the gold surfaces. The derivatized cubes were
washed with PBS, pelleted, and then resuspended in 1 mL PBS.

cubes spotted onto a wafer, captured with a 0.085 numerical aperture

Carboxyl-functionalized cubes
were incubated with EDC/NHS as described
in Activation of Carboxylated Observation Window
and Immobilization of Antibodies section. The activated cubes
were pelleted and resuspended in 400 μL of 0.25 mg/mL antibody
solution for overnight incubation at 4 °C with constant mixing
by inversion. The antibody concentration used was chosen to avoid
cube aggregation during conjugation since conjugated cubes were observed
to aggregate at offered antibody concentrations of 25 μg/mL,
but showed minimal aggregation at concentrations of greater than 125
μg/mL (section S2, Figure S3, Supporting
Information). The cubes were then pelleted and resuspended
in 2% BSA, 100 mM hydroxylamine for passivation at room temperature
for 3 h. The cubes were then washed with PBST, resuspended in 1 mL
PBS and stored at 4 °C.

Assay Procedure
qPCR tube reaction
vessels were fabricated
by adding inlet and outlet tubes as detailed in the Supporting Information, and fitted with antibody-modified
tube caps prepared as described above. To perform the assay (schematic
shown in Figure 2), pathogen-spiked samples
(340 μL) were mixed with 1.5 × 105 antibody-modified
retroreflector cubes in 1 mL Luer-Lok syringes (Becton-Dickinson,
Franklin Lakes, NJ) mixed for 1 h at room temperature on a rotator
at 12 rpm. The premixed samples were then drawn into reaction vessels
through the sample inlet ports by suction from syringes attached to
the sample outlets. Once filled, the vessels were allowed to stand
inverted (window side down) for 15 min to allow cubes to settle to
the observation surface. Tubes were turned upright for 2 min, and
then the 15 min sedimentation was repeated to allow cubes initially
settled in the wrong orientation a chance to reorient and bind.

Figure 2 Schematic of
assay. (A) Premixed sample is introduced by suction
and (B) allowed to settle to the transparent observation window. (C)
Tube is inverted, the observation window is imaged and retroreflecting
cubes are counted.

Specificity was enhanced
by the net downward force exerted by the
buoyant weight of the cubes when the tube is in the upright orientation,
and additional fluidic force discrimination was applied by way of
a 0.5 s pulse on a Vortex Genie 2 (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA)
at setting 6 to disrupt any remaining nonspecific interactions. The
tubes were then held upright for at least 2 min to ensure cubes falling
from the surface would be well beyond the depth of field of the CMOS
camera and would, therefore, not be imaged.

Retroreflector Cube Imaging
and Counting
Images of
the observation window were captured using a 0.085 numerical aperture
lens and a CMOS camera (EO-5012M, Edmund Optics, Barrington, NJ) with
inline illumination (halogen incandescent light source) controlled
by a custom LabVIEW-based software application. The camera was angled
at 35° from the vertical for selective imaging of retroreflected
light in preference to specular reflection, and a low NA was used
to discriminate against scattered light.

To count the cubes,
images were taken of 3 separate regions within the observation areas
of the caps. The three images were then cropped along their focal
planes to dimensions 1.4 mm by 0.35 mm and stitched together using
Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). The number of cubes
within each imaged region was then determined using ImageJ 1.46r (National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MA) by setting a binary threshold
to differentiate the cubes from background illumination followed by
automated counting (section S3, Figure S4–S9, Supporting Information).

Results and Discussion
Polypropylene
Activation and Antibody Immobilization
We characterized the
functionalization of the polypropylene observation
window of the qPCR tube caps at different stages by XPS and ATR-FTIR
analysis.

FTIR spectra (Figure S10, Supporting
Information) show that after oxidation with chromic acid, peaks
at 3710–3100 and 1760–1550 cm–1 appear
and a broadening at 1320–1210 cm–1, occurs,
indicating the presence of hydrogen bonded –OH stretch, carboxyl C=O stretch, and carboxylic
acid C–OH stretch, respectively. After conjugation
to antibodies, the broad –OH stretch peak at 3600–3000
cm–1 remains, and a shifted peak at 1670 cm–1 indicates the presence of amide C=O.34,37−39 These chemical functionalities
were not seen on the untreated material.

XPS survey scans (Figure
S11, Supporting Information) show that
atomic oxygen on the surface of the polypropylene material
increased from 0.67% to 14.9% after reaction with the chromic acid
solution. High resolution C1s scans of the oxidized sample were fitted
with four Gaussian peaks representing the bonds C–C/C–H at 284.6 eV, C–CO2 at 286.0 eV, C–O at 287.2
eV, and CO2 at 288.6 eV indicating the presence of carboxyl and other oxygenated
carbon moieties on the surface after treatment.34,39,40

The presence of functional antibodies
on the polypropylene cap
surface after conjugation was confirmed by the direct capture of fluorescein-conjugated E. coli bacteria on caps functionalized with anti-E. coli antibodies. Caps covalently modified with BSA were
used as a negative control. Figure 3 shows
fluorescence microscopy images demonstrating the successful capture
of FITC-labeled E. coli onto the covalently coupled
caps, and the absence of binding on the BSA surfaces.

Figure 3 Demonstration of functional
anti-E. coli antibodies
on polypropylene observation window by specific capture of FITC-labeled E. coli. ( A) Fluorescence image of covalently coupled anti-E. coli surface and of (B) covalently coupled BSA surface
after incubation with the bacteria. Scale bars are 10 μm; images
were equally and uniformly postprocessed for brightness.

Though the images demonstrate the successful capture
of fluorescently
labeled bacteria onto the antibody coated surface, as opposed to the
BSA surface, there is some concern that electrostatic interactions
might play a role in this outcome. The isoelectric point (pI) of BSA
is estimated to be 4.8,41,42 and the pI of various
subclasses of IgG, present in polyclonal sera, can vary from below
6 to 9.5.43,44 This experiment was conducted at physiological
pH (100 mM PBS, pH 7.4), at which BSA is generally anionic and a subpopulation
of the anti-E. coli antibodies can be cationic. Unmodified E. coli has been reported to possess a net negative surface
charge and could therefore be attracted to positively charged surface-bound
groups and be repelled by negatively charged surfaces.45−47 However, it is well-known that high ionic strength media (such as
∼0.1 M NaCl) suppress nonspecific binding due to compression
of the electrostatic double layer, therefore binding is believed to
be the result of specific antibody–antigen interactions.48

Fabrication of Retroreflector Cubes and Immobilization
of Antibodies
The previously reported method of fabricating
the micron-scale
retroreflector cubes resulted in low (32%) and variable release of
the cubes from the silicon substrate, as well as delamination of the
reflective gold layers, over time, from the sides of the released
cubes. The current process, detailed in the Materials
and Methods section, is improved by the addition of a titanium
adhesion layer on top of the cubes, prior to deposition of gold and
a sacrificial copper layer below the cubes. Gold has poor adhesion
to SU-8 and to silicon;49 the addition
of a titanium layer ensures proper adhesion and limits delamination
of the gold layers from the released cubes. The sacrificial copper
layer, once etched away, allows more uniform release of the cubes
into solution with average recovery of 85%.

The cube functionalization
protocol was optimized to avoid aggregation of cubes; as with commercially
available particles. We have characterized the homogeneity of the
conjugated cube population by optical microscopy of wet preparations;
aggregation of the conjugated cubes appears to be minimal.

Specificity
of immobilized antibodies was verified by conjugating
anti-rabbit IgG antibodies, anti-mouse IgG antibodies and D1.3 anti-hen
egg lysozyme (HEL) antibodies to thermally evaporated gold spots on
silicon via well-established DSP thiol coupling chemistry. Anti-E. coli and anti-MS2 cubes were spotted on the antibody
coated gold areas and then washed gently, by aspiration, with PBST.
The resulting substrates were then observed and the bound cube density
determined.

Figure 4 and scanning electron
microscope
images (Figure S12, Supporting Information) reveal that cubes conjugated with rabbit antibodies were captured
by anti-rabbit antibody spots at much higher densities than the anti-mouse
and (murine) D1.3 anti-lysozyme antibody spots, providing an indication
of the specificity of the cubes.

cubes bearing rabbit anti-E. coli and anti-MS2 polyclonal
antibodies. Error bars are
1 SD from at least 4 independent antibody spots.

Assay Performance
Detection of E. coli was
performed in PBS and in 10% human serum diluted in PBS at concentrations
of 103, 104, and 106 cells/mL. Detection
of MS2 bacteriophage was performed in the same media at concentrations
of 104, 105, 106, and 108 virus particles/mL. The assay system design was optimized to prevent
the presence of air bubbles, which may sweep away bound particles
by surface tension.32 To achieve specificity,
during upright orientation of the assay tubes, the buoyant weight
of the cubes applies a net downward force of 1.8 pN, as estimated
by simple force balance, enough to break weak nonspecific interactions
which are on the order of 0.1–1.0 pN. The optional radial fluidic
force discrimination step by pulse vortexing applied a lateral acceleration
of approximately 4.3 × g, which was enough to disrupt any remaining
nonspecific interactions.23,24

As shown in Figure 5, as the concentration of bacteria increases, the
number of retroreflecting cubes detected also increases; however,
binding of cubes in 10% human serum is somewhat lower than observed
in buffer. This is likely because of serum proteins directly interacting
with the analyte or blocking binding sites on the assay antibodies.50−52

Figure 5 Dose–response
for detection of E. coli via
sedimentation of retroreflector cubes. Error bars are 1 SD from at
least 3 independent experiments.

The detection of MS2 bacteriophage in both buffer and 10%
human
serum is shown in Figure 6. As expected, an
increase in virus concentration produces an increase in the retroreflector
cube count. At very high virus concentrations the cube density decreases,
however, probably due to a hook effect as excess virus coats both
cubes and the observation surface.52−54

Figure 6 Dose–response
for detection of MS2 via sedimentation of
retroreflector cubes. Error bars are 1 SD from at least 3 independent
experiments.

Statistical analysis
was performed using a one-tailed Student’s t test to determine the limit of detection of the assay
based on the concentrations tested, with 95% (p <
0.05) confidence level. The LOD for E. coli was found
to be 104 cells/mL in both buffer and 10% serum, comparable
to more sophisticated rapid diagnostic formats.11,20 Estimated LODs for MS2 were more matrix-sensitive at 106 virus particles/mL in buffer and 104 virus particles/mL
in 10% serum. While these values differ due to residual variability
in this early stage assay, each is well below the levels of viremia
seen in many diseases55−57,46−48 and competitive with many established laboratory methods such as
qPCR, ELISA, and microscopy, as well as POC lab-on-chip devices which
range, in their respective limits of detection, from 103–108 virus particles/mL.21,58

The relatively small fraction of the 150 000 offered
cubes
observed bound to the window deserves comment. The observation window
covers only 36% of the area of the tube cap, and only those cubes
which fall and bind in the proper orientation (i.e., with transparent
sides facing the camera) will be detected. Also, since we image the
observation window from a single direction, only cubes illuminated
from a direction within the 90° arc of retroreflectance would
be detected. We therefore estimate the percentage of cubes which we
would detect within the observation window to be 36% × 1/2 ×
1/4 = 4.5% of the total number bound. While this fraction is small
and could be increased by, for example, imaging from multiple directions,
it is sufficient for successful assay performance.

During the
assay, multiple cubes could potentially bind to a single
bacterium, or the same virus particles. Clumps of cubes bridged by
analyte potentially could sterically hinder the binding of those analytes
to the capture surface and reduce the number of cubes observed during
the assay readout, negatively affecting the limit of detection and
the linearity of the dynamic range. However, this point-of-care assay
is not meant for quantification of target, and we, therefore, do not
believe this potential effect greatly affects the outcome of the test
results for a yes/no assay.

In MS2 detection, lower numbers
of cubes are bound to the observation
regions than those seen in E. coli experiments. This
may be due to the potential limitations of small virus particles in
bridging large cubes to the surface. Inherent heterogeneity of the
unpurified polyclonal anti-MS2 antibody stock preparations also may
have resulted in lower antibody densities on the anti-MS2 cube surfaces
as opposed to the affinity purified (by the vendor) antibodies conjugated
to the anti-E. coli cubes. This hypothesis is supported
by the lower capture densities of cubes by the anti-rabbit antibody
spots shown in Figure 4, suggesting that optimized
capture and detection antibody pairs may further improve the detection
limit for virus particles.

Sample-to-result time for this experimental
assay is currently
95 min and is dominated by the mixing and settling steps, but has
the potential to be greatly shortened with further optimization59,60 and centrifugation. Preliminary studies demonstrate that settling
time can be reduced to 1 min using mild centrifugation at 50 × g. Preliminary studies also support the possibility of multiplexing
the assay by multiwavelength observation of dye-doped colored retroreflecting
cubes.

Conclusion
We have developed a novel
POC assay utilizing ultrabright, retroreflective,
cubic microparticles in an inexpensive, potentially rapid and simple
format with sensitivity comparable to conventional laboratory-based
methods. An improved fabrication process has resulted in better recovery
of cubes which can be functionalized using well-established methods.
Detection of model pathogens was demonstrated in both buffer and 10%
human serum with similar detection limits of 104 cells/mL
and 104 virus particles/mL for E. coli and MS2 bacteriophage, respectively. Future work will involve the
development of a multiplexed assay via the fabrication of colored
retroreflector cubes doped with photoresist-soluble dyes. Differently
colored cubes bearing antibodies against different pathogens may be
used simultaneously within the same vessel and detected automatically
in the presence of target.
