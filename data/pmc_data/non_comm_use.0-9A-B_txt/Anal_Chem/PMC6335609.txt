Interactions of ribonucleic
acids (RNA) with basic ligands such
as proteins or aminoglycosides play a key role in fundamental biological
processes. Native top-down mass spectrometry (MS) has recently been
extended to binding site mapping of RNA–ligand interactions
by collisionally activated dissociation, without the need for laborious
sample preparation procedures. The technique relies on the preservation
of noncovalent interactions at energies that are sufficiently high
to cause RNA backbone cleavage. In this study, we address the question
of how many and what types of noncovalent interactions allow for binding
site mapping by top-down MS. We show that proton transfer from protonated
ligand to deprotonated RNA within salt bridges initiates loss of the
ligand, but that proton transfer becomes energetically unfavorable
in the presence of additional hydrogen bonds such that the noncovalent
interactions remain stronger than the covalent RNA backbone bonds.

==== Body
Native mass
spectrometry (MS)
is an evolving technique1−3 for the study of biomolecular
complexes that relies on the retention of noncovalent interactions
during and after solvent removal by electrospray ionization (ESI).
If, to what extent, and on what time scale biomolecular structure
can be preserved after transfer into the gas phase has become an active
field of research.4−8 Solvent removal on its own can cause structural changes as it alters
the strength of noncovalent interactions,4 and native “top-down” MS approaches9−18 employ various dissociation techniques by which the energy of the
biomolecular complexes is increased. The kind of information that
can be obtained in native top-down MS experiments thus critically
depends on the relative stability of noncovalent interactions and
covalent bonds: If the latter are more stable, complex composition
and stoichiometry can be revealed, whereas if the former are more
stable, binding sites and primary structure can be determined.3 The cleavage of covalent bonds while preserving
noncovalent interactions seems counterintuitive, especially when slow
heating methods such as collisionally activated dissociation (CAD)
are used. Nevertheless, a number of gas-phase studies have demonstrated
that noncovalent bonds can be stronger than covalent bonds.10,18−22

For example, we have recently shown that the electrostatic
interactions
between TAR ribonucleic acid (RNA) and a peptide comprising the arginine-rich
binding region of tat protein are sufficiently strong in the gas phase
to survive RNA backbone bond cleavage by CAD, thus allowing its use
for probing tat binding sites in TAR RNA.10 X-ray crystallography23 and solution
NMR24 were so far unsuccessful in providing
a detailed picture of the TAR–tat binding interface, but highly
converging structures of TAR RNA in a complex with a cyclic tat peptide
mimetic showed interactions of all basic residues with phosphodiester
moieties25 and excellent agreement with
the binding site predicted from our MS data.10 At the solution pH of 7.7 used in our study, the arginine (pK > 11)26 and lysine (pK > 10.5)26,27 side chains of tat peptide should
be protonated and available for salt bridge (SB) formation with the
deprotonated RNA phosphodiester moieties (pK 1–3).28 We attributed the unusual strength of TAR–tat
interactions in the gas phase to electrostatic interactions, of which
salt bridges are thought to provide the highest contribution to stability.20,29 However, the question remains as to how many and what types of interactions,
alone or in combination, are sufficient for probing of RNA–ligand
binding sites by CAD.

Thermodynamic information for noncovalent
interactions of small
gaseous complexes has been determined with high accuracy,30,31 but it is challenging, if not impossible, to obtain data for larger
systems in which the strength of individual neutral (10–40
kJ/mol)30,32,33 and ionic
(20–170 kJ/mol)30,33 hydrogen bonds (HB) is modulated
by other charges and noncovalent bonds. Likewise, the stability of
salt bridges between protonated basic (e.g., arginine side chains)
and deprotonated acidic (e.g., RNA phosphodiester moieties) sites
is strongly affected by the number and distribution of other charges
and the hydrogen-bonding network. Williams and co-workers recently
found that this is the case even for small complexes: As a result
of differing hydrogen bond networks and net charges, glycine dimer
anions and cations have SB and HB interfaces, respectively.34 Here, we have studied the relative strength
of noncovalent and covalent bonds in gaseous RNA–ligand complexes
formed by association reactions in solution and ESI.35 Seven peptides (GR, VR, DR, ER, KR, RR, NGR) and the fixed-charge
ligand tetramethylammonium (Tma) were investigated in 1:1 complexes
with seven different RNAs (Table 1).

Experimental Section
Experiments were performed on a 7 T Fourier transform ion cyclotron
resonance mass spectrometer (Bruker, Austria) equipped with an ESI
source, a linear quadrupole for ion isolation, and a collision cell
through which a flow of Ar gas (0.2 L/s except when indicated otherwise)
was maintained for CAD.36 RNA–ligand
complexes were electrosprayed (1.5 μL/min) from solutions of
RNA (1 μM) and ligand (5–100 μM) in 1:1 CH3OH/H2O at pH ∼ 7.5, adjusted by the addition
of piperidine and imidazole (∼1.3 mM each). CH3OH
was high-performance liquid chromatography grade (Acros, Vienna, Austria)
and H2O was purified to 18 MΩ·cm using a Milli-Q
system (Millipore, Austria). Dipeptide acetate salts were from Bachem
(Bubendorf, Switzerland) and NGR and RNAs 2–7 from Sigma-Aldrich (Vienna, Austria), and used without further
purification. RNA 1 was prepared by solid-phase synthesis
and desalted as described in ref (37). According to theoretical predictions (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi),38 RNAs 1–7 should not form any stable secondary structures in solution,
especially at the high methanol content used. However, RNAs 1–4 could potentially form hairpin structures
in the presence of ligands.35 The CAD experiments
were performed over a period of 18 months, and we did not observe
any correlation between the order of experiments and the collision
energy required for dissociation of the RNA or RNA–ligand complexes.
Between 50 and 100 scans were added for each spectrum.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
yield of products from CAD of (M – 3H)3–,
(M + VR – 3H)3–, (M + RR – 3H)3–, and (M + Tma – 4H)3– ions
of RNA 1 versus collision energy. In agreement with earlier
studies,10,36,39 CAD of the
(M – 3H)3– ions produced predominantly c and y fragments from RNA phosphodiester
backbone bond cleavage; at elevated collision energy, a and w fragments from C3′–O
backbone bond cleavage and internal (i) fragments
from secondary backbone bond cleavage appeared (Figure S1a). Products from loss of nucleobases and H2O from (M – 3H)3– and fragment ions were
also observed (Figure S2a) and included
in the calculation of RNA and fragment yields.

Figure 1 Products from CAD of
(a) (M – 3H)3–, (b)
(M + VR – 3H)3–, (c) (M + RR – 3H)3–, and (d) (M + Tma – 4H)3– ions of RNA 1 versus laboratory-frame collision energy
illustrate the competition between covalent RNA backbone bond cleavage
into c/y, a/w, or i fragments (blue) and noncovalent
bond dissociation into free RNA (red) and ligand; energies required
for 50% complex dissociation and 50% fragment formation are indicated
by arrows.

Similar products and product yields
were observed in CAD of (M
+ Tma – 4H)3– ions of RNA 1 (Figure S1b), although the collision energy required
for 50% fragment formation by breaking of covalent backbone bonds, E50(c), increased by ∼5%
from 46.7 ± 0.1 to 48.8 ± 0.1 eV (Figure 1a,d). The increase in E50(c) can be attributed to the ∼6%
increase in degrees of freedom (DOF) of the (M – 3H)3– and (M + Tma – 4H)3– ions from 777 to 825.40 CAD produced no free RNA from dissociation of
Tma, and no c6, c7, a6, a7, or y7 fragments (w7 was not observed) without Tma were detected even at
the highest collision energy used (Figure S3a). Moreover, none of their complementary fragments, y2, w2, w1, and c1 (a1 and y1 were not observed), carried
Tma. Fragments from cleavage at sites 2–5 showed varying occupancy
with Tma (Figure S3b), which suggests binding
of Tma to residues 2–5. The occupancy values of c2 and c5 and their complements y6 and y3 were relatively
constant over the collision energy range in which signal-to-noise
ratios of c and y fragments with
and without Tma attached were not limited by low yields (below 39
eV) or secondary backbone bond cleavage (above 57 eV), and added up
to 105 ± 1% and 99 ± 1% for c2/y6 and c5/y3, respectively.

By contrast,
the occupancy values of c3/y5 and c4/y4 fragments from cleavage at sites
3 and 4 varied strongly with collision energy, between ∼40%
and ∼85%, and those from cleavage at site 4 added up to ∼130%
(Figure S3b). The variation in occupancy
values can be attributed to strong binding of Tma to both residues
3 and 4, and the competition between complementary fragments (c3 and y5, c4 and y4) for Tma
during fragment separation. Strong binding of Tma to residues 3 and
4 is further indicated by the presence of CU in all internal fragments
with Tma attached from CAD at the highest collision energy used (66
eV): i(GCUA + Tma), i(GCU + Tma),
and i(CUA + Tma). The added occupancy values >100%
likely result from the lower stability against secondary backbone
cleavage of fragments without ligand attached compared to that of
fragments with ligand attached.10 From
the fact that no free RNA and even internal fragments with Tma attached
were observed in CAD of (M + Tma – 4H)3– ions
of RNA 1, we conclude that the noncovalent bonds between
Tma and the RNA are far stronger than the covalent backbone bonds
of the RNA. This order is consistent with the calculated interaction
energy between gaseous Tma and dimethylphosphate of 355 kJ/mol41 and the energies for hydrolysis of dimethylphosphate
by H2O42 and 2′,3′-ribose
cyclic phosphate by CH3OH43 attack
on the phosphorus atom of ∼190 and ∼225 kJ/mol, respectively.

The breakdown curves of the (M + RR – 3H)3– ions of RNA 1 were highly similar to those of the (M
– 3H)3– and (M + Tma – 4H)3– ions (Figure 1);
again, CAD produced no significant yields of free RNA at any of the
collision energies used. The E50(c) of 52.1 ± 0.1 eV was ∼12% higher than that
for (M – 3H)3–, which is close to the ∼16%
increase in DOF of the (M – 3H)3– and (M
+ RR – 3H)3– ions from 777 to 924. However,
the yield of c and y fragments with
RR attached was lower by a factor of ∼0.7 than that for Tma
(Figure S4), which indicates RR dissociation
from the fragments at elevated collision energy. In support of this
hypothesis, the added occupancy of c and y fragments with RR decreased with increasing collision
energy (Figure S5). The lower stability
of the noncovalent interactions between RR and the c, y fragments compared to that of Tma can be attributed
to proton transfer (PT) within intermolecular salt bridges. In a recent
CAD study of RNA 1 in complexes with guanidine or guanidine
derivatives including R, we found that PT from protonated ligand (L)
to a deprotonated phosphodiester moiety of the RNA, which converts
the intermolecular salt bridge into a far weaker hydrogen bond, generally
preceded ligand dissociation.35 Likewise,
PT from a protonated guanidinium group of RR to a deprotonated phosphodiester
moiety of a c or y fragment should
precede loss of RR. However, protonated RR has a zwitterionic structure
in the gas phase44 (Scheme 1) and can form two salt bridges with the
RNA, such that transfer of two protons is required for SB to HB conversion.
The higher stability of the noncovalent interactions of the (M + RR
– 3H)3– ions over that of the complexes of
RNA 1 with guanidine or its derivatives, all of which
dissociated at collision energies below that required for covalent
RNA backbone cleavage into c and y fragments,35 is consistent with higher
energy requirements for transfer of two instead of one proton. Finally,
the higher stability of the noncovalent interactions of Tma with RNA 1 compared to those of RR is consistent with a far higher
proton affinity (PA) of deprotonated Tma (which is the corresponding,
overall neutral base of Tma) compared to that of RR. This data suggests
that the electrostatic energy between the positively charged ligands
and deprotonated RNA is high enough to prevent ligand dissociation
during CAD unless PT from ligand to RNA occurs.

The peptide ligands other than
RR showed weaker binding to RNA 1 (Figure S6), and besides fragments
from RNA backbone cleavage, CAD also produced free RNA as illustrated
for VR in Figure 1b.
Just like in our previous study,35 (M –
4H)4– RNA ions were not observed in CAD of the complexes
with a net charge of −3, consistent with PT from protonated
ligand to the RNA prior to ligand dissociation. The collision energy
required for 50% ligand dissociation by breaking of noncovalent bonds, E50(nc), in CAD of the (M +
VR – 3H)3– ions was 36.3 ± 0.1 eV, and
the collision energy required for 50% fragment formation by breaking
of covalent bonds, E50(c), was 52.1 ± 0.1 eV. Thus, for VR, E50(nc) is 69.6 ± 0.2% of E50(c). Furthermore, we found that increasing
the rate of Ar gas flow through the collision cell36 by 50%, from 0.2 to 0.3 L/s, only slightly increased both E50(nc) (by 3%, from 36.3 ±
0.1 to 37.4 ± 0.1 eV) and E50(c) (by 4%, from 52.1 ± 0.1 to 54.1 ± 0.1 eV),
but E50(nc) in % of E50(c) was, within error limits,
the same at 0.3 L/s (69.2 ± 0.2%) and 0.2 L/s (69.6 ± 0.2%).
Accordingly, small fluctuations in Ar gas flow rate (on the order
of a few percentage points), and thus partial Ar pressure in the collision
cell, should not significantly affect E50(nc), E50(c), or E50(nc) in % of E50(c).

The E50(c) values
for all ligands (Figure 2a), including those for the guanidine ligands from our previous study,35 showed little variation (average 52.8 eV, standard
deviation ±1.7 eV) that can in part be attributed to differences
in the number of DOF of the complexes (Figure S7, Table S1). By contrast, the E50(nc) values varied strongly, between −1.4
and 43.2 eV, which is up to 81% of the corresponding E50(c) values (Figure 2). The only ligand PA values available (tmeGnd,
1032 kJ/mol; Gnd, 986 kJ/mol; R, 1051 kJ/mol)45 did not correlate with complex stability, the order of which (tmeGnd
< Gnd < R) cannot be attributed to differences in the number
of DOF of the complexes either (tmeGnd, 843; Gnd, 798; R, 855).35 However, the E50(nc) values increased linearly with the number of
hydrogen bond donors of the ligands (Figure 2, Scheme S1). E50(nc) values for GR, VR, DR,
and ER were similar, which suggests that the side chain carboxylic
acid functionalities were not involved in RNA–ligand binding.
This hypothesis is supported by extensive loss of H2O loss46,47 from (M + DR – 3H)3– and (M + ER –
3H)3– ions (Figure S8). For ligands with the same number of HB donor atoms (Gnd/Gpa, aGpa/R,
GR/VR, DR/ER), E50(nc) values of the ligands with the longer alkyl chain (Gpa, R, VR,
ER) were consistently higher, suggesting that both inductive effects
on PA and conformational flexibility alter complex stability. However,
these effects are far smaller than that of the number of HB donor
atoms (Figure 2).

charge of −3, and (b) E50(nc) in % of E50(c), versus the number of HB donor atoms of the ligands; lines are
linear fit functions and the gray area in (b) illustrates the 99%
confidence interval.

The E50 values here are from
CAD experiments
under multiple-collision conditions, and calibration of the laboratory-frame
collision energy scale to an internal energy scale is not straightforward.36,48,49 Nevertheless, because all complexes
were studied under the same experimental conditions on the same instrument
and are similar in size and composition and any effects of DOF cancel
out when E50(nc) is expressed
in % of E50(c) (Figure 2b), we can draw some
solid conclusions from our data. The E50 values in Figure 2b show that HB interactions interfere with PT within intermolecular
salt bridges,35 from the ligand guanidinium
group to a deprotonated phosphodiester moiety of the RNA, and subsequent
ligand dissociation in an additive manner. Schmuck and co-workers
observed similar behavior in aqueous solution where the stability
of complexes between guanidinium derivatives and dipeptide carboxylates
was found to increase with increasing number of HBs between the binding
partners.50,51

The linear fit function in Figure 2b extrapolates to
13.5 HB donor atoms at 100%, where E50(nc) is equal to E50(c), which is just below
the 14 HB donor atoms of RR. However, the fit is to data for ligands
with a single guanidinium group, and as discussed above, gaseous (RR
+ H)+ has a zwitterionic structure in which both guanidine
side chains are protonated (Scheme 1); in (GR + H)+, (VR + H)+, and
(KR + H)+, the only charged site is the guanidinium group.44 Thus, for RR, E50(nc) is probably far higher than E50(c), which is also indicated by the
presence of fragments with RR attached at energies of up to 66 eV
(Figure S4). For the ligands with a single
guanidinium group, each hydrogen bond increased the stability of the
RNA–ligand interaction by an average of 8.6% relative to E50(c). Assuming that E50(c) is close to the energy
for hydrolysis of 2′,3′-ribose cyclic phosphate by CH3OH (∼225 kJ/mol),43 the
average stabilization per HB would be ∼20 kJ/mol, which is
typical for HBs in the gas phase.30,32,33

To address the effect of RNA structure on ligand
binding, we determined E50 values for
RNAs 1–7 in complexes with VR and
RR (Figure 3a and Figure S9). Neither E50(nc) nor E50(c) showed a clear correlation
with RNA sequence, composition, or possible secondary structure (Table 1), which indicates
unspecific binding to phosphodiester moieties in nonhairpin structures
without significant differences in stabilization by nucleobase interactions.
Consistent with unspecific binding, the c and y fragments with VR and RR attached revealed binding to
the phosphodiester moieties of residues 3 and 4 of RNAs 1–7 (Figure S10), just
like Tma. Finally, we have studied the effect of net charge on complex
stability. For both RNA 1 and its complexes with Tma
and VR, the E50(c) values
decreased nearly linearly with increasing charge (Figure 3b). A similar decrease was
observed for the E50(nc) values for VR at −2 and −3, but that at −4
was substantially lower, such that E50(nc) in % of E50(c) was similar at −2 and −3, 65.7 ± 0.3%
and 69.6 ± 0.2%, but only 22.0 ± 0.1% at −4. This
can be rationalized by more facile PT and/or fewer hydrogen bonds
in more extended structures at −4 (0.5 charges/nt) compared
to that at lower net charge (0.25 and 0.375 charges/nt at −2
and −3, respectively).

eV (right axis).

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we show that the interactions between Tma or (RR
+ H)+ and deprotonated RNA are strong enough to survive
RNA backbone cleavage by CAD. By contrast, salt bridges between ligands
with a single guanidinium group and RNA anions convert into far weaker
hydrogen bonds, followed by loss of ligand, at energies that are sufficiently
high for RNA backbone cleavage unless the RNA–ligand interaction
is stabilized by additional hydrogen bonds. For complexes of different
8 nt RNA with di- and tripeptide ligands with a single arginine residue
and a net charge of −3, additional stabilization by >13
hydrogen
bonds increases the strength of the noncovalent interactions beyond
that of the covalent RNA backbone bonds. Moreover, our data reveal
similar stability of complexes with 0.25–0.375 charges/nt,
but substantially reduced stability at 0.5 charges/nt. Because net
charge can easily be adjusted by the use of ESI additives,52 probing ligand binding sites in RNA by top-down
MS10 should be possible even for very small
peptides or other basic ligands such as aminoglycosides. Importantly,
our study is a major step toward rationalizing the contributions of
individual noncovalent interactions to the overall stability of gaseous
biomolecular complexes, and toward resolving the ongoing controversy
of whether or not native top-down mass spectrometry can provide reliable
information on binding interfaces.
