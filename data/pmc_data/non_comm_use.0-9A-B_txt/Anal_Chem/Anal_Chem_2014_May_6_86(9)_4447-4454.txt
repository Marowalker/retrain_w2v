The
process of immobilizing enzymes onto solid supports for bioreactions
has some compelling advantages compared to their solution-based counterpart
including the facile separation of enzyme from products, elimination
of enzyme autodigestion, and increased enzyme stability and activity.
We report the immobilization of λ-exonuclease onto poly(methylmethacrylate)
(PMMA) micropillars populated within a microfluidic device for the
on-chip digestion of double-stranded DNA. Enzyme immobilization was
successfully accomplished using 3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS) coupling to carboxylic acid
functionalized PMMA micropillars. Our results suggest that the efficiency
for the catalysis of dsDNA digestion using λ-exonuclease, including
its processivity and reaction rate, were higher when the enzyme was
attached to a solid support compared to the free solution digestion.
We obtained a clipping rate of 1.0 × 103 nucleotides
s–1 for the digestion of λ-DNA (48.5 kbp)
by λ-exonuclease. The kinetic behavior of the solid-phase reactor
could be described by a fractal Michaelis–Menten model with
a catalytic efficiency nearly 17% better than the homogeneous solution-phase
reaction. The results from this work will have important ramifications
in new single-molecule DNA sequencing strategies that employ free
mononucleotide identification.

==== Body
Recently,
solid-phase bioreactors
have found interesting applications in the areas of single-molecule
enzymology,1 biochemical manufacturing,2 and nanotechnology.3,4 A subgroup
of solid-phase bioreactors called immobilized microfluidic enzymatic
reactors (IMERs)5,6 comprises systems in which an
enzyme is immobilized within the channels of a microfluidic device.
There are several advantages associated with these systems as opposed
to their homogeneous (liquid-based) counterparts. These include enhanced
stability and activity of the tethered enzyme relative to the enzyme
in free solution,7−9 reduced interference from catalytic enzymes during
the analysis phase of the assay,10 and
reusability of the enzyme.11−13 In the case of proteolytic enzymes
such as trypsin, immobilization of the enzyme can prevent autodigestion
as well.14 The reported success in the
attachment of enzymes onto solid supports stems from the availability
of several enzyme/solid surface attachment chemistries.15,16 Based on the plethora of available attachment chemistries, solid
supports such as silicon, glass, or polymers, can be selected to accommodate
the pendant functional groups available on most proteins and the fabrication
strategies used to produce the fluidic devices associated with IMERs.17,18

Of the numerous chemical strategies for protein attachment,
many
rely upon reactions between functional groups within the protein (amine
and/or carboxylic acids) and complementary groups on the solid surface.17 In general, noncovalent19 and covalent20 attachment chemistries
have been used to immobilize proteins to solid surfaces with the latter
reported to provide more robust linkages, hence, less susceptibility
to detachment or denaturation.3 If the
interactions between the protein and support are not carefully designed,
there is a tendency to produce reactors possessing randomly oriented
proteins with some orientations providing inactive forms.21 Attachment chemistries involving the use of
affinity tags such as poly-His and glutathione S-transferase have
been shown to eliminate issues with random attachment of enzymes to
solid surfaces; nevertheless, they form chemical bonds that can become
unstable over time or after multiple usages of the reactor.3 A recent study suggested that limiting the surface
functional group density of a substrate can induce single site-attachment
minimizing the generation of multisite attachment potentially deactivating
the immobilized biomolecule.22

In
the past decade, polymer substrates have become beneficial for
the design of biological reactors due to their exceptional biocompatibility,
widespread surface functionality, attachment chemistries that are
relatively stable over a wide range of pH values, and the ease of
surface activation for the generation of functional scaffolds for
protein attachment.23−26 In many cases, polymer substrates can exhibit glass-like properties,
such as high optical transparency and low autofluorescence, and provide
production of low-cost fluidic devices with good fidelity, appropriate
for in vitro diagnostics.27−29 Some polymeric
materials which possess the aforementioned characteristics are poly(methylmethacrylate)
(PMMA)27 and cyclic olefin copolymer (COC).30 In particular, PMMA has been a substrate of
choice in the design of fluidic devices for biological assays due
to its favorable biocompatibility,27 excellent
optical properties, and simplicity in the surface modification techniques
that can be employed.24 Previously, we
have shown that IMERs can be generated using PMMA substrates for the
proteolytic digestion of proteins.31,32 PMMA IMERs
with immobilized trypsin have shown enhanced enzyme stability, high
reaction rates, and the absence of trypsin autodigestion, thereby
simplifying protein identification using mass spectrometry.31,32

Exonucleases, which cleave double-stranded DNAs (dsDNA) or
single-stranded
DNA (ssDNA) along the phosphate backbone to generate mononucleotides,
are involved in biological processes such as replication, repair,
and recombination.33 Lambda-Exonuclease
(λ-Exo), isolated from lambda bacteriophage, is a toroidally
shaped processive enzyme composed of three identical subunits with
a tapered pore active site, 30 Å diameter on one face for entry
of dsDNA and 15 Å diameter on the opposite face for the exit
of ssDNA.34−36 λ-Exo, which digests only dsDNAs with phosphorylated
5′ ends, has been suggested to possess a processivity of ∼3 000
nucleotides in free-solution and generate an intact ssDNA byproduct
with an electrostatic ratchet digestion mechanism.37 Though its clipping rate is highly variable, single-molecule
measurements have revealed an average value of ∼1 000
nt s–1.38 The digestion
properties of λ-Exo offer several unique applications.39 For example, λ-Exo has been suggested
to be useful in single-molecule DNA sequencing strategies,40 one format of which involves the exonuclease
and an α-hemolysin nanopore. Previous simulation and experimental
reports have suggested the use of immobilized λ-Exo for the
systematic clipping of DNA into mononucleotides with each unit identified
via a molecular-dependent flight time through nanochannels.41,42 The unique capabilities of λ-Exo and its immobilization onto
solid supports can serve as a useful tool in the design of biosensors
directed toward the sequence analysis of DNAs.10

A recent study demonstrated the digestion of dsDNA
by λ-Exo
with the dsDNA electrostatically anchored onto the substrate surface
and the enzyme introduced in free solution and allowed to randomly
bind to the free end(s) of the anchored dsDNA.43−45 Single-molecule
fluorescence studies, with a fluorescently stained dsDNA target revealed
that λ-Exo digestion occurred in three modes; (i) incomplete
digestion at only one end of the dsDNA molecule; (ii) full simultaneous
digestion at both ends; and (iii) incomplete digestion at both ends.43 While this single-molecule enzyme study provided
valuable information concerning the catalytic action of λ-Exo,
it did not address the scenario in which the enzyme was immobilized
and the dsDNA target was present in free solution.40 A report by Perkins et al., which showed the successful
immobilization of a single λ-Exo apoenzyme/dsDNA complex onto
a quartz substrate, revealed that the activity of λ-Exo remained
comparable to the free solution digestion.46

In this work, we report the first IMER involving λ-Exo
as
the immobilized enzyme for the digestion of dsDNA. λ-Exo was
immobilized onto a PMMA device consisting of an array of micropillars
populating a bioreactor. This device geometry allowed for an increased
enzyme load and reduction in the diffusional kinetic barriers associated
with open-channel IMERs.47 The immobilization
was accomplished using 3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS) coupling chemistry for the
conjugation of λ-Exo to UV-generated carboxylic acids on the
PMMA surface. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed the absence of
nonspecific attachment (physisorption) of the enzyme to the polymer
surface indicating that the enzyme was only attached covalently to
the surface. Capillary electrophoresis using laser-induced fluorescence
detection (CE-LIF) of the digestion products provided information
on the lengths of the fragments remaining after digestion. Fluorescence
microscopy studies of YOYO-1 stained dsDNA allowed for real-time observation
of the digestion from which the enzyme clipping rate and apparent
processivity were deduced.

Experimental Section
IMERs Fabrication
The IMERs used in this study consisted
of a 1.4 mm × 24 mm polymer microchannel populated with 3 600
microposts, each 50 μm tall and 100 μm in diameter.48 Details on the device fabrication are provided
in the Supporting Information. Parts A
and B of Figure S1 in the Supporting Information show the CAD drawing and SEM image of the device, respectively.

Enzyme Immobilization onto PMMA IMERs
λ-Exo was
anchored onto the IMERs’ surfaces using EDC-NHS coupling chemistry
previously outlined by our group for the immobilization of amine-containing
biological entities onto photoactivated PMMA substrates.49−52 A discussion of the immobilization chemistry is found in the Supporting Information with the reaction scheme
shown in Figure S1C.

Digestion Studies of dsDNA
Duplexed
λ-DNA (48 502
bp), purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA), was incubated
in the enzyme-modified IMERs for various reaction times. The desired
reaction times were achieved by hydrodynamic pumping (PHD2000 syringe
pump, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) a λ-DNA solution through
the IMERs at an appropriate flow rate. An experimental control, which
involved the introduction of a solution containing λ-DNA into
the IMER bed in the absence of immobilized enzyme, was performed.
The control revealed that there was neither a loss nor breakage of
the dsDNA from nonspecific adsorption onto the reactor wall or shearing,
respectively. On-chip enzymatic reactions were temperature controlled
at 37 °C via a custom-built thermocouple heating stage. The effluent
was collected at the device outlet for downstream analyses with CE
and bulk fluorescence measurements.

Fluorescence Measurements
of IMER-Digested dsDNA
PicoGreen
intercalating dye (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) was used to
determine the amount of intact dsDNA remaining after passage through
the IMERs. PicoGreen shows high specificity for binding to dsDNA with
a 1 000-fold fluorescence enhancement after intercalation to
dsDNA. Because the dye displays minimal amounts of fluorescence upon
binding to ssDNA (<10% that of dsDNA) and does not bind to mononucleotides
with an associated fluorescence increase,53 it is suitable for determining specifically the dsDNA content from
a λ-Exo reaction, which should consist of ssDNA, dsDNA, and
mononucleotides. The DNA staining dye was added postdigestion to avoid
perturbation in enzymatic activity of λ-Exo that may result
from nuclear staining.54 The dye-labeled
samples were excited at 480 nm and fluorescence spectra (490–700
nm) were collected and analyzed using a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorimeter
(Horiba JobinYvon, Edison, NJ) and DataMax Software 2.20. Kinetic
data was acquired using a PicoGreen-stained digested dsDNA sample
at varying input concentrations (20–5 μg/mL) using a
60 s reaction time with 4.96 pmol of surface-bound enzyme.

CE-LIF
Digestion products and the HIND III sizing ladder
were analyzed using a home-built CE instrument with
LIF detection. A schematic of this system can be found in Figure S2
in the Supporting Information.

Enzyme Quantification
The amount of λ-Exo in
solution was determined using a spectrophotometric assay (Pierce 660
nm protein assay kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific; Rockford, IL). Details
of enzyme quantification can be found in the Supporting
Information.

AFM Characterization of PMMA/λ-Exo
Surfaces
To
deduce the surface coverage and possible orientation of the enzyme,
cleaned PMMA sheets (1.7 cm × 1.7 cm squares, 3 mm thick) were
activated with UV light and incubated with a λ-Exo solution
overnight at 4 °C in the absence and presence of EDC/NHS coupling
reagents. Samples were rinsed with reaction buffer and ddH2O and gently dried with compressed air prior to AFM analysis. Surface
characterization was performed using an Asylum Research MFP3D AFM
at a 1.00 Hz scanning rate in ac (tapping) mode. At this scanning
frequency, we speculate that there would be negligible damage of the
immobilized enzyme from the tapping force exerted by the tip.

Real-Time
Digestion Analysis Using Fluorescence Microscopy
The microscope
used in this study was a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M inverted
microscope (75 W Xe lamp, Zeiss, Germany) fitted with a 100×/1.3
NA oil-immersion microscope objective and an Andor iXon3 EMCCD camera
(20 fps acquisition rate). A custom mount was machined to hold the
assembled IMERs onto the microscope stage. All images were acquired
using MetaMorph Advanced 7.7.6.0 Software (Molecular Devices LLC,
Sunnyvale, CA) and analyzed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, MD).

PMMA IMERs were modified as previously described.
λ-Exo reaction buffer (glycine-KOH in ultrapure water at pH
9.4, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, reagents purchased from Sigma Aldrich)
was prepared without the cofactor (Mg2+). Following enzyme
attachment, λ-DNA stained with YOYO-1 in a 1:50 dye-to-base
pair ratio was introduced into the reactor in a Mg2+ free
buffer to allow for the generation of the necessary enzyme/DNA complexes.
Next, the reaction buffer (1×) containing 25 mM MgCl2 was introduced into the IMERs to initiate the enzymatic reaction
after which the system was heated to 37 °C with real-time monitoring
of the digestion process. Reagent introduction into the IMER was achieved
using a PHD2000 syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). The
pump was connected to the inlet and outlet reservoirs of the IMERs
through peak tubing sealed via epoxy with the inlet tube connected
to a syringe using a leur-lock connector.

Results and Discussion
Enzyme
Attachment and Characterization
To determine
if λ-Exo was covalently attached to the activated PMMA surface
of the IMERs reactor bed, we performed spectrophotometric analysis
(660 nm) using a protein quantification kit. In this analysis, an
aliquot of the reaction solution containing the enzyme, before and
after running through the IMERs, was evaluated. The differences in
the pre- and postfilling absorbance values were used as an indicator
of the amount of enzyme remaining on the reactor surfaces. A calibration
plot (R2 = 0.992) using the UV absorbance
intensities of a protein calibration standard was used to determine
the amount (in picomoles) of enzyme attached to the polymer surface
for three different input amounts (75, 90, and 100 pmol). The amount
of enzyme immobilized range from 3.25 to 6.40 pmol, yielding a reaction
efficiency of 4.3–6.4%. On the basis of the available surface
area of the IMERs bed (1.17 cm2), the surface concentration
(pmol/cm2) was determined to range from 2.78 to 5.47. The
fact that the surface concentration increased over the concentration
range studied indicated that the surface was below monolayer coverage
(see Table S1A in the Supporting Information for results).

Successful attachment of λ-Exo onto PMMA
was further confirmed by AFM analysis. From the AFM scan depicted
in Figure 1A for the activated-PMMA/λ-Exo
reaction performed in the absence of the EDC/NHS coupling reagents,
there was no indication of the presence of surface features consistent
with the size of the λ-Exo enzyme. This confirmed that physisorption
of enzyme onto the activated polymer surface did not occur under these
reaction conditions. AFM images acquired from the PMMA surface in
which the EDC/NHS coupling reagents were used revealed the presence
of surface features consistent in height with λ-Exo (Figure 1B). Substrates containing covalently attached λ-Exo
had an average RMS roughness of 1.58 ± 0.18 nm as compared to
0.34 ± 0.01 nm for surfaces without enzyme. Further AFM scans
of the EDC/NHS/λ-Exo functionalized PMMA surface over a 15 μm
× 15 μm area (Figure 1C) revealed
surface features that possessed an average height of 14.3 ± 2.3
nm (see Figure 1D). This value is similar to
the reported dimensions of λ-Exo measured from X-ray crystallography
at angles α = β = γ = 90° (15.6 nm × 15.6
nm × 13.1 nm).36

Histogram of the height of features on the activated PMMA surface
and subsequently functionalized with λ-Exo determined by taking
an AFM line scan across each immobilized enzyme and measuring the
maximum height of the feature.

Although it is difficult to directly visualize the orientation
of the immobilized enzyme on PMMA, the closeness of the average measured
height of each feature to the protein crystallographic size indicates
that the enzyme is primarily oriented with its access pore normal
to the polymer surface. Though qualitative, this data indicated that
the UV dose and enzyme concentration used for the immobilization reaction
did not lead to surface cross-linking. Cross-linking may result in
the enzyme laying parallel to the surface making its pore inaccessible
to dsDNA based on surface steric considerations. This data also confirmed
that the conjugation of the complete homotrimer was achieved with
little if any dissociation into its monomer units.55

After UV-activation of the PMMA surface, the carboxylic
acid group
density was measured using a Toluidine Blue assay. For a UV dose of
16.0 mW/cm2 for 15 min, a carboxyl surface density of 32
pmol/cm2 was obtained, a value 10-fold higher than the
λ-Exo surface concentration stated above.49,56 The Toluidine Blue assay, while effective for approximate surface
carboxylate quantification, has the propensity to label carboxylic
acid groups below the substrate surface where enzyme attachment is
not possible due to inaccessibility issues.49

Surface Enzyme Activity
Figure 2 shows
the fluorescence spectra of a free solution λ-Exo digestion
of λ-DNA and one carried out in the IMERs for the same effective
reaction time (60 s). The control for this experiment consisted of
a 50 μg/mL λ-DNA stock solution exposed to an enzyme-free
reactor for 60 s, which was collected at the outlet of the reactor
and measured to determine if any loss of dsDNA resulted from transport
through the reactor. To determine the extent of DNA digestion in the
IMER, PicoGreen was added to the digestion products from the IMER
and the free solution reaction. The amount of dsDNA remaining after
digestion was monitored using fluorescence microscopy. As can be seen
from Figure 2, the amount of fluorescence observed
from the digestion products of the free solution was higher than that
from the IMERs. This indicated that more dsDNA was remaining for the
free solution digestion compared to the IMERs digestion. For the reactions
carried out here, peak area analysis of Figure 2 revealed that 91.7% of the dsDNA was digested for the IMERs compared
to 83.3% for the free solution digestion.

Figure 2 Plot of fluorescence
intensity for a λ-DNA stock solution,
free enzyme digestion, and the effluent from an IMERs digestion. The
emission spectra were taken from 490 to 700 nm with 480 nm excitation.
The spectrum labeled in black depicts the intensity of the λ-DNA
stock. The blue line represents the spectrum of the IMERS digestion
and the red line was that for the free solution digestion. For the
IMERs digestion, the amount of immobilized enzyme was 4.96 pmol. For
the λ-DNA stock, the IMERs was free of immobilized enzyme. In
all cases, the solutions were incubated with PicoGreen following the
reaction.

To evaluate the effects of enzyme
surface concentration on the
activity of the immobilized enzyme, experiments were conducted in
which the reaction time and dsDNA substrate concentrations were kept
constant and the enzyme surface concentration used for the digestion
varied (Table S1B in the Supporting Information). Our data revealed that ∼96% digestion of λ-DNA was
achieved when loading the IMERs with 3.25 pmol of enzyme (Table S1B
in the Supporting Information) with a slight
decrease in digestion efficiency at higher enzyme loads (∼85%
at a load of 6.20 pmol). However, over the range of λ-Exo surface
loads investigated, no statistical difference in the percent λ-DNA
digestion was observed at the 95% confidence level.

Next, experiments
were performed to carefully determine the effect
of changing the reaction time of the dsDNA with the immobilized enzyme
on the digestion efficiency. The IMERs were exposed to λ-DNA
for 60, 300, and 1200 s, which was controlled by changing the linear
velocity of the input λ-DNA through the reactor. The reactor
generated digestion efficiencies >90% for all reaction times investigated
(Table S1C in the Supporting Information).

Analysis of λ-Exo Reaction Products Using CE-LIF
As shown in the electropherogram obtained for the digestion products
of the IMERs, the Hind III sizing ladder and intact
λ-DNA (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information), there was the absence of peaks corresponding to the intact λ-DNA
following IMERs digestion suggesting that most of the λ-DNA
was digested. This is consistent with the data shown in Tables S1B,C
in the Supporting Information and Figure 2. The digestion reaction will proceed until (1)
the end of the dsDNA molecule is reached, (2) the enzyme dissociates
into its monomers, and/or (3) the DNA is expelled from the enzyme.36 Furthermore, it is possible that a dsDNA molecule
after threading through the pore of λ-Exo could be partially
digested, disengaged, and re-engaged with another enzyme molecule
within the IMER and undergoing further digestion from its complementary
phosphorylated strand. Because the CE results indicated that the dominant
dsDNA fragment size remaining was ∼7 kbp, this indicated an
apparent processivity of ∼41 kbp if the re-engagement of the
dsDNA molecule, which the CE-LIF results cannot determine, is ignored.

Reactor Reusability
We also tested whether the enzyme
could be used for subsequent rounds of digestion by running different
batches of λ-DNA through the reactor with different resident
times (see Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). For the initial reaction, the digestion efficiency was found to
be 95% for a 60 s reaction (see Table S1C in the Supporting Information). The reactor was then washed with
buffer and a second round of digestion was undertaken by infusing
λ-DNA through the IMERs. For the second round (60 s reaction
time), the digestion efficiency dropped to 80% and for the third round,
53%.

Real-Time Digestion of λ-DNA
The digestion of
a single dsDNA molecule with an immobilized enzyme was studied in
real-time using fluorescence microscopy. λ-Exo was immobilized
onto PMMA using EDC/NHS coupling chemistry and a solution of YOYO-1
stained dsDNA in a 1:50 dye to base-pair ratio was introduced into
the enzyme reaction buffer (glycine-KOH in ultrapure water at pH 9.4,
0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100) without Mg2+. Previous work by
Kang et al. revealed that stained dsDNA with a 1:50 dye-to-base pair
ratio has comparable digestion rates to unstained dsDNA in the presence
of λ-Exo.43

Real time monitoring
of the enzyme-threaded DNA’s fluorescence was conducted. Some
λ-DNA molecules within the microscopic region were observed
to be immobile at one end due to complexation with the λ-Exo
enzyme and freely moving at the opposite end due to shear forces.
Uncomplexed DNAs remained in the bulk flow and eventually disappeared
from the field-of-view. Following complexation, the reaction buffer
containing the necessary Mg2+ cofactor for λ-Exo
was added to initiate clipping and the reaction was monitored in real
time as depicted in Figure 3 under nonflow
conditions. To ascertain that the reduction in fluorescence intensity
was a result of digestion and not photobleaching or photonicking,
control experiments were performed by exposing an enzyme/DNA complex
to the excitation light in the absence of Mg2+. Under these
conditions, minimal amounts of fluorescence were lost during the time
course of the experiment (60 s).

for the real-time digestion
of dsDNA using λ-Exo covalently immobilized to a PMMA substrate
configured in the IMER device. (E–H) The corresponding fluorescence
intensity line plots taken from the still images shown in parts A–D.
In these cases, the line plot was secured from a horizontal line that
crossed the section in the still image containing the stained DNA
molecule. (I) Graphical depiction of the relative fluorescence intensity
of a single dsDNA that was digested by an immobilized λ-Exo
molecule as a function of reaction time, where possible pausing events
were seen in each inset. Immobilization of λ-Exo was accomplished
using EDC/NHS onto a PMMA substrate. The λ-DNA was labeled in
a 1:50 dye/bp ratio with YOYO-1. The fluorescence intensity was measured
in the presence (black) or absence (red) of the enzyme cofactor, Mg2+. The dotted line for the intensity profile in the presence
of Mg2+ indicates the time at which the cofactor was infused
into the IMER.

When the reaction was
fortified with Mg2+ ions, there
was an observed decrease in the bulk fluorescence of the λ-DNA/λ-Exo
complex (Figure 3). There were two regions
in the Mg2+ fortified enzymatic reaction where the fluorescence
intensity remained relatively constant for a short period of time
indicating that the digestion paused. According to previous work,
pauses are likely sequence-dependent; λ-Exo has the propensity
to pause in regions with GGCGATTCT sequences, which includes the GGCGA
5-bp motif.46 This study also suggested
that sequences associated with pausing could also be contained within
a GGCGATTCT domain.46 Upon examination
of the sequence of λ-DNA, it was determined that two regions
within its sequence contained the first 7 of the 9 bases within the
GGCGATTCT motif at 37 701 bp and 43 372 bp positions.
This is consistent with the pauses we observed in the fluorescence
intensity profile shown in Figure 3. The fluorescence
intensity was monitored until the signal strength became indistinguishable
from the background.

Fluorescence measurements were used to
determine the size of the
smallest detectable dsDNA fragment stained using a 50:1 base-pair
to dye ratio. From the calibration plot, the smallest detectable fragment
was 4.6 kbp (see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). The average digestion rate was determined based on the total number
of base-pairs for λ-DNA (48 502 bp) minus the size of
the smallest detectable fragment (4.6 kbp) and the time required for
the fluorescence to reach the baseline. This calculation yielded a
digestion rate of 1.0 × 103 ± 100 nt/s (n = 4), a value similar to that reported by Kang et al.
for electrostatically immobilized dsDNA.43

We also estimated the degree of processivity from a single
digestion
event (see Figure 3) and the shortest fragment
we could observe using fluorescence (4.6 kbp, Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). As seen in Figure 3, a single λ-DNA molecule engaged with the
immobilized λ-exonuclease resulted in a complete loss of fluorescence
indicating that the remaining fragment was <4.6 kbp in length;
the apparent processivity based on this analysis would be >40 kbp.
This number is in close agreement to that seen by the CE-LIF data
(see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). Our value was approximately 10-fold higher than previous reports
for free solution digestions using λ-Exo.38,43

The higher apparent processivity of the solid-phase reactor
relative
to the free-solution case could be attributed to increased stability
of the enzyme when anchored to the support. Previous reports have
shown that enzyme attachment may prevent the dissociation of λ-Exo
into its monomer units during a digestion event that terminates the
enzymatic reaction and, thus, limits its processivity.55 In addition, the processivity observed could
be associated with a dependence on dsDNA substrate length;34 as the dsDNA length increases from 0.5 to 23
kbp, it is less likely the enzyme will dissociate from the DNA.34 We note that the processivity reported here
was labeled as apparent because of the indirect evidence used to secure
this value. As discussed above, the CE-LIF data did not account for
re-engagement of a partially digested λ-DNA molecule. In addition,
the single-molecule fluorescence observations could not account for
digestion at both ends of a single dsDNA molecule.

Kinetic Description
of Immobilized λ-Exo
Attempts
to correlate the kinetic behavior observed for IMER digestions to
the classical Michaelis–Menten (MM) model or the Lilly–Hornby
model for packed solid-phase reactors have been unsuccessful,57,58 due to limitations associated with the MM model that assumes free
diffusion and thermodynamically driven collision of enzyme/substrate.
This is not the case for IMERs in which molecular mobility of the
enzyme is restricted due to immobilization. Also, the model for continuous-flow
enzymatic reactors, when the Lilly–Hornby model was applied,
was determined to be insufficient due to the strong reaction dependence
on flow rate of substrate through the reactor.58 Alternatively, the IMER reactions can be described by fractal-like
MM kinetics.59−61 Furthermore, enzymatic reactions involving polymerized
substrates like DNA can exhibit characteristics of fractal/MM kinetic
behavior.62

To explain the kinetic
behavior of our system, the fractal MM model proposed by Xu was used,
which modifies the classical MM approach by incorporating a fractal
contribution offering a more detailed explanation of MM like behavior.62 From this formalism, a fractal dimension, f, in the rate coefficient was used to account for the fractal
behavior observed using enzyme concentration [E]a,b, and
time ta,b, where a and b denote two different concentrations and times as seen
from eq 1: 1  For a solubilized enzyme acting on a polymer
substrate processively, the reaction may be considered as 1-dimensional
with f = 0.5. For an immobilized enzyme acting on
a soluble substrate, the reaction can be considered 2-dimensional
with f ∼ 0.3. The system depicted in our work
involves both cases and was determined to have a theoretical f value of ∼0.7 based on eq 1 and values obtained from experimental data. We then plotted our
experimental data at various λ-DNA concentrations as a Lineweaver–Burke
(double reciprocal) plot using the fractal formalism by Xu et al.

is the initial rate of the reaction
and its corresponding change (difference in concentration divided
by reaction time), [E] and [S] are the enzyme and substrate concentrations,
respectively, where [E] was determined from the 660 nm colorimetric
assay for protein quantification as previously mentioned, t is reaction time, k2′
is the enzyme turnover rate, and Km′
is the Michaelis constant; the primes indicate modified Michaelis’
constants based on the fractal behavior of our system (see eq 2). As can be seen in Figure 4, the double reciprocal plot for immobilized λ-Exo digestion
of dsDNA was linear and yielded k2′
= 5.24 s–1. This turnover rate was found by taking
the reciprocal of the intercept from the double reciprocal plot depicted
in Figure 4 and incorporating the enzyme concentration,
fractal number, and reaction time as noted in eq 2. Taking the reciprocal of the intercept and multiplying it by the
slope of the line from Figure 4 yielded Km′, which was found to be 4.8 ×
10–6 mM. According to Berg et al.,63 enzymes that have upper limit catalytic efficiencies, k2′/Km′,
on the order of 108 to 109 M–1 s–1 are said to have attained kinetic perfection,
which means that the reaction they catalyze occurs as quickly as the
reactants diffuse to the enzyme. From Figure 4, the catalytic efficiency for our system was determined to be 1.1
× 109 M–1 s–1.
According to Berg et al., this suggests that the catalysis is restricted
only by the rate at which the enzyme encounters substrate in the system.63 The efficiency of our solid-phase reactor as
denoted by k2′/Km′ when compared to a homogeneous digestion (0.9
× 109 M–1 s–1)34 indicated a 17% increase in catalytic efficiency
for duplex disassembly into individual mononucleotides for the IMERs.

Figure 4 Double
reciprocal plot depicting fractal-like Michaelis–Menten
kinetics of λ-Exo based on eq 2. Experiment
parameters were [S] = 1.5, 1.8, 2.1, 5, 3, or 6.6 (× 10–6) mM; [E] = 4.96 × 10–4 mM; f = 0.7; Km = 4.8 × 10–6 mM; and k2 = 5.24 s–1. These values were determined by extrapolation of 1/ν = (Km/Vmax)/[S] + 1/Vmax, where the initial rate was calculated by
the difference in concentration as a measure of the fluorescence of
the remaining dsDNA divided by the reaction time (60 s).

Conclusion
In this study, we demonstrated
for the first time, to the best
of our knowledge, the attachment of a processive exonuclease (λ-Exo)
to a PMMA solid phase reactor configured in a microfluidic device
(IMERs). The covalent attachment to a photoactivated PMMA support
was accomplished using EDC/NHS coupling chemistry, which utilized
carboxylic acid groups that were generated by UV-activation of the
PMMA surface. The data presented in this work suggested that λ-Exo,
when immobilized onto a solid support with controlled carboxylic acid
surface density, adopted primarily a single-point attachment configuration
with the pore of the enzyme accessible to dsDNA. The IMERs demonstrated
increased efficiency as determined by the k2′/Km′ value when compared
to a homogeneous digestion of dsDNA.34 In
addition, our IMERs exhibited an increased apparent processivity compared
to a homogeneous reaction and displayed fractal-like enzyme kinetics
due to the heterogeneous nature of the IMER and the processive digestion
of dsDNAs. The findings secured in this study will provide important
information on strategies for immobilizing exonuclease enzymes to
solid supports for potential applications in single-molecule DNA sequencing.40,41
