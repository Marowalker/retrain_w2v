The
emergence of complex protein therapeutics in general and monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) in particular have stimulated analytical chemists
to develop new methods and strategies for their structural characterization.
Mass spectrometry plays a key role in providing information on the
primary amino acid sequence, post-translational modifications, and
other structure characteristics that must be monitored during the
manufacturing process and subsequent quality control assessment. In
this study, we present a novel method that allows structural characterization
of mAbs based on MALDI in-source decay (ISD) fragmentation, coupled
with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) MS. The method
benefits from higher resolution of absorption mode FT mass spectra,
compared to magnitude mode, which enables simultaneous identification
of ISD fragments from both the heavy and light chains with a higher
confidence in a wide mass range up to m/z 13 500. This method was applied to two standard mAbs, namely
NIST mAb and trastuzumab, in preparation for method application in
an interlaboratory study on mAbs structural analysis coordinated by
the Consortium for Top-Down Proteomics. Extensive sequence coverage
was obtained from the middle-down analysis (IdeS- and GingisKHAN-digested
mAbs) that complemented the top-down analysis of intact mAbs. In addition,
MALDI FT-ICR MS of IdeS-digested mAbs allowed isotopic-level profiling
of proteoforms with regard to heavy chain N-glycosylation.

==== Body
Structural
characterization
of protein therapeutics is an essential part of their development
and production process.1−4 Regulatory authorities require in-depth characterization, and detailed
quality control, of biopharmaceuticals to demonstrate similarity of
the drug substance from different batches, throughout the production
process. Moreover, structural analysis provides rationale for optimizing
biopharmaceuticals downstream processing and formulation studies.

The most important class of clinically approved protein therapeutics
are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) class.5,6 The IgG molecule has a symmetric Y-shaped structure that is composed
of two identical heavy chains (Hc, approximately 50 kDa each) and
two identical light chains (Lc, approximately 25 kDa each). The Hc
is typically N-glycosylated at one specific asparagine in the fragment
crystallizable (Fc) region.

Structural complexity in IgGs is
increased by additional post-translational
modifications (PTMs) such as intra- and interchain cysteine–cysteine
connections (disulfide bonds), possible polypeptide truncation, and
chemical modifications such as asparagine deamidation and methionine
oxidation. Consequently, comprehensive structural analysis of mAbs
at a proteoform level is a challenging task.7 Specifically, the read-out of the primary sequence,8−10 mapping of disulfide bonds,11,12 and profiling of protein
glycosylation13−16 require various strategies that add up to a time-consuming procedure.
These structural characteristics are monitored during the manufacturing
process and must meet the criteria defined for the critical quality
attributes of each mAb.17

Current
MS-based characterization assays of mAbs utilize primarily
standard bottom-up proteomics strategies.18 Sample preparation in these assays involves a reduction/alkylation
step, with an inherent risk of introducing artifacts, for example
when quantifying or localizing deamidation or oxidation.1 Furthermore, it is well-known that a bottom-up
workflow can miss detection of partial backbone cleavages or unexpected
modifications.19 Middle- and top-down strategies,
in which the mAb is only partially digested or left intact, can largely
overcome these issues.7 Such approaches
are mostly carried out on high-resolution electrospray ionization
instruments.20,21 However, matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization (MALDI) in-source decay (ISD) MS is a powerful
alternative for primary structure characterizations of both N- and
C-terminal parts of proteins, including mAbs.22,23 In the MALDI-ISD workflows, off-line reduction of disulfide bonds
is avoided, and reduction is instead achieved by using 1,5-diaminonaphthalene
(1,5-DAN) as a MALDI matrix.24,25 The hydrogen-donor
property of this matrix results in the reduction of the disulfide
bonds during the ionization process.

In MALDI-ISD spectra, c-type fragment ions are
usually the most intense series, while z + 1- (or z + 2), w-, y-, b-, and a-type fragments are less abundant.
Most if not all fragment ions obtained from MALDI-ISD are singly charged
(protonated) resulting in relatively simple mass spectra. Nonetheless,
in case a mixture of proteins or polypeptide subunits is considered,
such as for the analysis of an intact mAb (Hc and Lc) or its middle-down
products, the complexity of MALDI-ISD spectra increases. Thus, mass
measurements at ultrahigh resolution are crucial for unambiguous identification
of ISD fragment ions in a wide m/z-range. The most frequently used instruments in MALDI-ISD MS are
time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzers that exhibit a limited resolving
power.10 In a previous study, we have shown
that small (singly charged) proteins can be measured at isotopic resolution
up to about m/z 17 000 using
a 15T MALDI Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) MS
system and that in-depth structural information on these proteins
can be obtained from ultrahigh resolution MALDI-ISD spectra (with
a resolving power of 62 000 at m/z 16 950).26 The sequence information
obtained using this method was complementary to the information obtained
from other fragmentation techniques. Notably, these previous measurements
were performed using mass spectra represented in magnitude mode FT
(mFT). The quality of FT-ICR MS data can be further improved if absorption
mode FT (aFT) representation is used instead.27−30

In this study, we improved
MALDI FT-ICR MS acquisition methods
and complemented these with the absorption-mode FT mass spectral representation.31 This was applied to analyze intact, and IdeS-
and GingisKHAN-digested mAbs (NIST mAb and trastuzumab), without the
need of buffer exchange, prior disulfide bond reduction, or chromatographic
separation, allowing the analysis of these mAbs by MS within few minutes.
The use of ultrahigh resolution MS allowed us to identify ISD fragments
in a wide m/z-range, leading to the extensive and
reliable structure characterization of mAbs.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
Two different mAbs, namely trastuzumab (HzIgG1kappa,
CHO) and NIST mAb standard (HzIgG1kappa, NS0), were provided by the
CTDP.32 Both mAbs were provided in the
intact form and in a digested (but not disulfide bond reduced) form,
using structure-specific enzymes IdeS or GingisKHAN (Genovis, Lund,
Sweden).33,34 Briefly, intact trastuzumab and NIST mAb
standard were diluted from initial concentrations of 21 and 10 mg/mL,
respectively, to a final concentration of 2 mg/mL, using MQ water,
and stored at −80 °C in 20-μL aliquots (in 500-μL
Lobind Eppendorf tubes) until further use.

Antibody subunits
were generated in the following manner. To induce mAb cleavage below
the hinge region, intact mAbs at 1 mg/mL in PBS, pH 6.8, were digested
with 1000 units of Fabricator (IdeS), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, at 37 °C for 30 min, under shaking (350 rpm). The
reaction was quenched by adding trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration
of ∼0.05% and the samples were stored at −80 °C
until further use. To initiate mAb cleavage above the hinge region,
intact mAbs at 1 mg/mL in 100 mM Tris, pH 8, were digested with 1000
units of GingisKHAN (Gingipain K), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, at room temperature (RT) for 1 h. The reaction was quenched
by adding trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of ∼0.05%,
and the samples were stored at −80 °C until further use.
All samples were aliquoted and shipped on dry ice. 1,5-Diaminonaphthalene
(1,5-DAN; handle with care, check material safety data sheet), α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (HCCA), horse myoglobin,
and acetonitrile (MS grade) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO, USA). A stock solution of myoglobin at 2 mg/mL was prepared
in water.

MALDI-Spotting
For ISD MS analysis, each sample (i.e.,
myoglobin, intact and digested mAbs) was diluted 1- to 10-fold with
MQ water and spotted onto a MALDI ground steel target plate (Bruker
Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) as follows. First, 1 μL of diluted
sample was put on the plate, followed by addition of 1 μL of
1,5-DAN (saturated solution in acetonitrile/water/formic acid, 50%:49.95%:0.05%)
using a 10-μL pipet tip (Rainin tips from Mettler-Toledo, Tiel,
Netherlands). Gentle mixing of the 2-μL droplet was performed
until small crystals were visible by eye; then the mixture was allowed
to dry at RT. In addition, 1 μL of diluted IdeS digest was spotted
with 1 μL of α-cyano matrix (saturated solution in acetonitrile/water/formic
acid, 50%:49.95%:0.05%) in a similar way. A 200 μg/mL solution
of myoglobin (1 μL) was spotted with 1 μL of 1,5-DAN (saturated
solution in acetonitrile/water/formic acid, 50%:49.95%:0.05%) and
used for external calibration of the FT-ICR MS system.

MALDI Mass
Spectrometry
All MALDI- and MALDI-ISD FT-ICR
MS experiments were performed as previously reported, with some modification
of the acquisition methods.26 Briefly,
all MS experiments were performed on a Bruker 15 T solariX XR FT-ICR
mass spectrometer equipped with a CombiSource and a ParaCell (Bruker
Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The FT-ICR MS system was controlled by
ftmsControl software and equipped with a Smartbeam-II Laser System
(Bruker Daltonics) that operated at a frequency of 500 Hz, and each
single spectrum was generated from 200 laser shots. Higher trapping
potentials (up to 9.5 V) and ParaCell DC biases (up to 9.3 V) were
used to improve the mass measurement precision. Three mass spectra
were obtained from a single spot, using three acquisition methods
for the corresponding m/z-ranges:
1012–5000; 1012–7000 and 2024–30 000.
A fourth acquisition method was used in the m/z-range 3495–30 000 for glycoform analysis.
For this purpose, a second MALDI-spot was used. The measurement time
ranged from 0.98 min for the acquisitions in the m/z-range 1012–5000 to 2.89 min for the acquisitions
in the m/z-range 3495–30 000.
A detailed description of the FT-ICR MS parameters of the four applied
acquisition methods is provided in Supporting Information Table S1. The instrument was externally calibrated
using ISD fragments obtained from myoglobin for the four different
acquisition methods.

Absorption Mode FT Spectra Representation
To display
an FTMS spectrum in the aFT, it is necessary to correct for systematic
phase shifts across the frequency range that result from the methods
used to induce coherent ion motion in the respective instruments.
Various methods have been presented for solving this phase correction
problem on the Orbitrap20,30 and on FT-ICRs.28,29,31,35 In this study, the FT-ICR MS data files were recorded to include
the transient data (fid) file. The aFT mass spectra were generated
directly from the transient data files using AutoVectis software suite
(Spectroswiss, Lausanne, Switzerland) that incorporates an improved
version of the AutoPhaser method31 using
a genetic algorithm35 to optimize the phase
correction function,36 applies an asymmetric
apodization function to minimize baseline deviations in the resulting
absorption mode spectrum,37 and generates
synthetic isotopic distributions with aFT peak profiles to aid peak
identification.38 The data were processed
by applying a full-bell, but asymmetric apodization function (F =
0.4) to minimize baseline deviations in the resulting aFT spectrum,
while allowing balance between the spectral resolution and signal-to-noise
ratio across the spectrum.37 After apodization,
the transients were doubly zero-padded before being processed using
the default AutoVectis settings. An internal calibration was applied
before analysis in Autoseequer tool. Fragment ions were assigned with
an error tolerance of 10, 20, and 40 ppm for the spectra acquired
with methods 1, 2, and 3, respectively (see Table S1). The tolerance for the quality value for the match between
the observed and theoretical isotopic distribution was 0.65 for c- and z + 1-type fragment and 0.60 for a-, b-, y-, and w-type. An internal calibration of the spectra was also
applied before spectral interpretation using mMass.39 The theoretical c-type fragments from
the Lc of each mAb were used as internal calibrants of the spectra
generated from intact mAbs while the c-type fragments
from Fd subunit were used for the internal calibration of the spectra
generated from IdeS- and GingisKHAN-digested mAbs.

Theoretical
Isotopic Distributions for Figures
The
elemental composition of ISD fragments was calculated using an in-house
developed tool in Excel, and theoretical isotopic abundance distributions
were generated using the online tool enviPat Web 2.2 (http://www.envipat.eawag.ch/index.php),40 exported in the “comma-separated
value” format and compiled in a text file. Plots were generated
in Excel and exported in Adobe Illustrator CS6 to make the figures.

N-Glycosylation at the Fc-Part
N-glycosylation of the
Fc-part of both NIST mAb and trastuzumab was evaluated. The IdeS-based
enzymatic cleavage of NIST mAb and trastuzumab results in two identical
Fc/2 parts (approximately 25 kDa each) and one F(ab)2 portion (approximately
100 kDa). We analyzed IdeS digests of both NIST mAb and trastuzumab
by MALDI FT-ICR MS using HCCA as MALDI matrix without the use of any
additional separation.

Results and Discussion
MALDI-ISD FT-ICR MS of
Intact and Digested NIST mAb
Intact and both IdeS- and GingisKHAN-digested
mAbs were analyzed
by MALDI-ISD FT-ICR MS. Ultrahigh resolution MS analysis (estimated
resolving power 660 000 at m/z 400) was performed using three different acquisition methods to
maximize both sensitivity and mass measurement precision in the m/z range from 1012 to 13 500 (Figure 1). Thus, obtained spectra from the analysis of intact NIST
mAb are combined in Figure 1A. Note that ISD fragments from both light chain (Lc) and
heavy chain (Hc) are detected simultaneously. The combined spectra
obtained from the analysis of IdeS- and GingisKHAN-digested NIST mAb
are depicted in Figures 1B and C. IdeS is an enzyme that cleaves the Hc of the NIST mAb below
the hinge region, between G239 and G240, whereas GingisKHAN cleaves
above the hinge region, between K225 and T226.33,34 The application of 1,5 DAN reduces the disulfide bonds during the
MALDI process. Thus, ISD fragment ions were simultaneously generated
from intact Lc, Fd, and Fc/2 digestion products. The increased complexity
of the IdeS/GingisKHAN-digested mAb samples hampers unambiguous fragment
ion assignments especially at higher m/z-values (both in magnitude and absorption mode). Consequently, fragment
ions from digested NIST mAb were assigned up to m/z 7000, whereas fragment ions from intact NIST
mAb were assigned up to m/z 13 500.

Magnitude-Mode FT versus Absorption-Mode FT Mass Spectra
Resolving power is a key parameter in MS-based analysis of complex
samples. Overlapping peaks can result in ambiguous identifications
when mass resolution is not sufficient. FT-ICR MS provides the highest
resolving power within the different classes of mass spectrometers
and allows for the analysis of extremely complex samples such as petroleum,41 mixtures of biomolecules,42 and nanomaterials.43

However,
ultrahigh mass resolution (UHMR) requires longer measurement time
(seconds) with inherently reduced sensitivity. Therefore, the measurement
time was balanced with ion intensities resulting in a maximum resolving
power of 660 000 (magnitude mode FT, estimated at m/z 400, see Table S1)
for MALDI-ISD FT-ICR MS measurements. To further improve resolving
power the acquired ICR transients were processed to obtain aFT mass
spectra. To this end, we used AutoVectis software to perform a phase
correction of ICR time-domain data with reduced baseline deviations.
The results of such a correction, in terms of improved resolving power
and increased identification confidence, are exemplified in Figure 2. Here, magnitude-mode
visualization did not allow the resolution of the isotopic distributions
of the fragments c49 of the Lc and of
the fragment c51 and z + 148 of the Hc with pyro-glutamate at the N-terminus
and a lysine loss at the C-terminus (Figure 2A). The postacquisition phase correction
increased the resolving power and thus resolved the three isotopic
distributions (Figure 2B). Note that the observed and theoretical isotopic distribution
of the z + 149 of the Lc did not match, thus this fragment
was not identified and not included in the sequence coverage (Figure 3). Similarly, the
isotopic distribution of the fragment c47 of the Fc/2 fragment and Lc and the fragments c48 and z + 144 of the Hc with
pyroglutamate at the N-terminus and a lysine loss at the C-terminus
that were not resolved in the mFT mass spectrum (Figure 2D) could be distinguished after
phase correction in the aFT mass spectrum (Figure 2E).

of NIST mAb showing
the increased resolving power obtained after phase correction of mFT
mass spectra.

Figure 3 Sequence coverage obtained
from the top-down and middle-down analysis
of NIST mAb. Total sequence coverage was 50% and 65% for Hc and Lc,
respectively. Next to glycosylation, two additional proteoforms of
the Hc were identified, namely a pyro-glutamine modification at the
N-terminus and a lysine loss at the C-terminus.

Identification of ISD Fragment Ions
The identification
of ISD fragment ions was performed using AutoVectis. In addition,
ISD spectra were visually inspected and matched to theoretical isotopic
distributions of fragment ions (Figure S1). As described in the Experimental Section, we used three different acquisition methods to obtain optimal sensitivity
in different m/z ranges. The sequence
coverages for intact and IdeS-digested NIST mAb were obtained using
these methods and AutoVectis (Figures S2 and S3). As an example, the mass measurement errors of all c- and z + 1-type fragment ions identified in the
MALDI-ISD FT-ICR MS spectrum of IdeS-digested NIST in the m/z-range 1000–7000 are reported
in Figure S4.

Most of the fragment
ions were identified in both mFT and aFT spectra and only a minor
part were identified exclusively in aFT spectra (data not shown).
Phase correction led to additional identifications only when isotopic
distributions were not resolved in mFT, for example, in the cases
depicted in Figure 2.

MALDI-ISD analysis of the same mAb samples has also been
performed
using TOF MS. It is noted, however, that TOF MS instruments exhibit
a lower resolving power, with corresponding limitations, even when
Lc and Hc are analyzed separately. Overlapping isotopic distributions
can result from fragment ions of different forms of the same chain.
For example, the heavy chain c52 fragment
ion with N-terminal pyroglutamate and the z + 149 fragment ion from the Hc with a C-terminal lysine-loss have
monoisotopic peaks located at m/z 5528.871 and 5529.664, respectively (Figure S5). These fragment ions are baseline-resolved by FT-ICR MS
but not by TOF MS.10 In addition to c-type ions, the most intense fragment in the spectra, and z + 1-type ions, other fragment types were detected and
identified. Examples of y-, b-, a-, and w-type fragments are depicted in Figure S6. In addition, we identified these fragment
types in the MALDI-ISD FT-ICR MS spectrum generated from the analysis
of IdeS-digested NIST mAb in the m/z-range 1000–7000 (Figure S7). Considering
the total number of fragment ions identified in this spectrum (see Figures S3 and S7), the percentage of c-, z + 1-, w-, a-, y-, and b-type were
42%, 22%, 12%, 11%, 11%, and 2%, respectively.

The identification
of different fragment ion types improves the
confidence in the structural characterization of mAbs. In fact, less
frequent fragment ions can be used either to corroborate the identifications
based on c- and z + 1-type ions
or to identify amino acids adjacent to prolines. A drawback of additional
fragment types is that the signal intensity is distributed over many
more fragment ions with a consequent reduction of the signal-to-noise
(S/N). In addition, the presence of many fragment types complicates
the ISD spectra, making their interpretation more difficult. At last,
with a higher number of fragment ions the false discovery rate (FDR)
must be evaluated when identifications are not manually confirmed.

Sequence Coverage of NIST mAb
In this study, we have
developed a fast characterization method based on ultrahigh resolution
MALDI-ISD FT-ICR MS for the analysis of mAbs. This method allowed
the direct analysis of mAbs without the need of a buffer exchange
or a chromatographic separation of Lc and Hc or Fd′ and Fc/2
digestion products. Using this method, two modifications on Hc of
the NIST mAb were identified beyond glycosylation profiling, namely
a pyroglutamate at the N-terminus and a lysine-loss at the C-terminus.
The frequency of these two modifications was estimated at 100% and
50%, respectively. The analysis of intact NIST mAb resulted in a sequence
coverage of 31% and 65% for Hc and Lc, respectively (Figure 3). The analysis of both IdeS
and GingisKHAN digests increased the sequence coverage for the Hc
up to 50%. The total sequence coverage for the complementarity-determining
regions (CDRs) was 72% and 96% for Hc and Lc, respectively.

Sequence
Coverage of Trastuzumab mAb
MALDI-ISD FT-ICR
MS was also used to analyze trastuzumab. As for the NIST mAb, the
high resolving power allowed the reliable identification of different
types of ISD fragments in a wide mass range. The sequence coverage
obtained from the identification of c- and z + 1-type fragment ions is reported in Figure S8. The analysis of the intact trastuzumab led to sequence
coverages of 29% and 56% for Hc and Lc, respectively, while the analysis
of both IdeS and GingisKHAN digests allowed to increase the sequence
coverage for Hc to 49%. The total sequence coverage for the CDRs was
93% and 80% for Hc and Lc, respectively. In a recent report, trastuzumab
was analyzed by ETD and HCD fragmentation.44 Our MALDI FT-ICR MS analysis of trastuzumab provided sequence information
that was complementary to the information obtained. Also compared
to similar IgG mAbs using other fragmentation techniques MALDI-ISD
FT-ICR MS data is complementary.9,45−47 This is exemplified for adalimumab (middle-down LC-MS/MS using electron-transfer
dissociation) in Figure 4.9

Figure 4 Sequence coverage of light chain obtained
from the top-down MALDI-ISD
FT-ICR MS analysis of trastuzumab compared to previously reported
middle-down analysis by LC-MS/MS with electron-transfer dissociation
of adalimumab. The two methods resulted in complementary sequence
information as exemplified in the areas highlighted in green. The
differences in amino acid sequence between trastuzumab and adalimumab
are reported in red.

In general, the sequence coverage obtained using mFT or aFT
data
were similar. In fact, the number of fragment ions identified in mFT
spectra ranged from 95% to 100% the number of fragment ions in the
corresponding aFT spectra. This is rationalized by the fact that the
resolving power in mFT was already sufficient to identify most of
the fragment ions. Only a minor part of all identified fragment ions
were identified solely in aFT spectra. However, the identification
in aFT is more reliable since a higher resolution allows detection
of possible overlapping species.

Glycosylation Analysis
The MALDI FT-ICR MS strategies
we report here also provide insight into N-glycosylation of the Fc-part
of both NIST mAb and trastuzumab. Previously, in-depth glycosylation
analysis resulted in the identification of tens of different glycan
structures on the Hc of the IgG1 mAb.48 Most of these proteoforms (glycoforms) were detected as minor components,
whereas a few diantennary glycans represented more than 90% of the
total glycosylation.49 The analysis of
these major proteoforms has been reported using lower resolution MS
in combination with up-front separation.49,50 The high-resolution mFT spectra of IdeS-digested NIST mAb and trastuzumab
are depicted in Figure 5. The most abundant glycoforms of Fc-parts of both NIST mAb and trastuzumab
are observed as doubly charged ions and, for the first time, identified
at isotopic resolution. The relative abundance of these glycoforms
is in good agreement with previously reported characterization studies
of these mAbs.49,50

of IdeS-digested mAbs: (A) NIST mAb and (B) trastuzumab. For NIST
mAb at least seven different N-glycans are observed at the Fc-part
of Hc (detected as [M + 2H]2+ ions).

Conclusions
We have developed a
novel strategy based on ultrahigh resolution
MALDI-ISD FT-ICR MS to characterize mAbs. This strategy was applied
to primary structure and proteoform analysis of two IgG1 mAbs, namely
NIST mAb standard and trastuzumab. Complex top- and middle-down MALDI-ISD
FT-ICR mass spectra were generated from both intact mAbs and their
large, 25–50 kDa, subunits, produced via IdeS- and GingisKHAN-based
digestion. It was shown that MALDI-ISD fragment ions were complementary
to those observed in electron-transfer dissociation experiments, and
thus translated in additional sequence coverage of the mAbs. It is
noted that the combination of top-down and middle-down experiments
increased total sequence coverage, however IdeS- and GingisKHAN-based
digestions are not needed to map the antibody CDRs.

Postprocessing
of transients (using AutoVectis) was used to generate
absorption-mode FT mass spectra with improved resolving power resulting
in unambiguous assignments of further resolved fragment ions. It is
noted that although sequence coverage hardly increased, the superior
quality of aFT spectra led to a more confident characterization of
both N- and C-terminal parts of NIST mAb and trastuzumab compared
to mFT mass spectra of the same samples.

Finally, direct analysis
of IdeS digests by MALDI FT-ICR MS provided
a snapshot of the most abundant Fc-glycans that agreed with previously
reported in-depth microheterogeneity analysis of mAb Fc-glycosylation.
We envision integration of this strategy into a multimethod approach
designed for the in-depth structural characterization of complex proteins
such as mAbs.
