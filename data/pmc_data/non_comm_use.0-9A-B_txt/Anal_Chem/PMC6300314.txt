Knowledge
about the functions of individual proteins on a system-wide
level is crucial to fully understand molecular mechanisms underlying
cellular processes. A considerable part of the proteome across all
organisms is still poorly characterized. Mass spectrometry is an efficient
technology for the global study of proteins. One of the most prominent
methods for accurate proteome-wide comparative quantification is stable
isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). However,
application of SILAC to prototrophic organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, also known as baker’s
yeast, is compromised since they are able to synthesize all amino
acids on their own. Here, we describe an advanced strategy, termed
2nSILAC, that allows for in vivo labeling of prototrophic baker’s
yeast using heavy arginine and lysine under fermentable and respiratory
growth conditions, making it a suitable tool for the global study
of protein functions. This generic 2nSILAC strategy allows for directly
using and systematically screening yeast mutant strain collections
available to the scientific community. We exemplarily demonstrate
its high potential by analyzing the effects of mitochondrial gene
deletions in mitochondrial fractions using quantitative mass spectrometry
revealing the role of Coi1 for the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (respiratory chain complex IV).

==== Body
Knowledge about protein functions
is mandatory to fully understand cellular processes. Although numerous
genomes have been sequenced decades ago, the functions of many proteins
are still unknown or only poorly characterized. The genome of the
budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an important and widely used eukaryotic model organism to study
biological processes, contains approximately 6700 genes, of which
more than 10% are still uncharacterized.1,2

A powerful
strategy to elucidate the function of poorly characterized
proteins and the cellular process in which they are involved is the
proteome-wide analysis of cells deficient for a gene encoding such
protein by quantitative mass spectrometry (MS).3 For most accurate quantitative MS analysis at a proteome-wide
scale, stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)
is used,4,5 which is based on the metabolic incorporation
of isotope-coded “heavy” amino acids into the proteome
during cell growth. This allows for mixing of differentially labeled
cells directly after harvesting, which minimizes differences caused
by experimental variations during sample handling. This is of particular
advantage for quantitative proteomic studies of subcellular structures
including organelles that are purified following multistep protocols.
To exploit its full potential, SILAC is best performed with isotopically
labeled lysine and arginine.6 It is frequently
observed, though, that heavy arginine is converted to heavy proline,7−11 which compromises quantification of SILAC peptide pairs.12 Effective strategies have been developed to
minimize arginine-to-proline conversion, including culturing of cells
in the presence of unlabeled proline.8,13

Since
yeast is prototrophic and, thus, able to synthesize all amino
acids endogenously, SILAC studies are usually performed using strains
in which genes coding for enzymes of the arginine and lysine biosynthesis
pathways have been deleted to ensure complete labeling of the proteome
with the heavy versions of these amino acids.14,15 However, this strategy precludes the use of yeast mutant strain
libraries that are readily accessible for the scientific community,16−20 but lack the auxotrophies required for SILAC.

Previous studies
showed that prototrophic yeast can be labeled
with heavy amino acids when grown on glucose.21−23 Walther and
co-workers introduced this concept as “native SILAC”
(nSILAC) using heavy lysine for labeling of the yeast strain W303
grown on glucose22 and further applied
this concept to study protein turnover in yeast.24

In this work, we developed “2nSILAC”,
a strategy
that allows for complete metabolic labeling of prototrophic yeast
with both isotope-coded lysine and arginine. We show that this strategy
works efficiently for yeast grown on fermentable and respiratory carbon
sources making it well-suited for the study of mitochondria, organelles
with essential functions in eukaryotic cells, which usually requires
respiratory growth conditions. We demonstrate the high potential of
2nSILAC for proteome-wide studies by using it for loss-of-function
studies of selected mitochondrial proteins in S. cerevisiae under respiratory conditions.

Experimental Section
Yeast
Strains, Cultivation, and Metabolic Labeling
S. cerevisiae strains used in this
study were BY4741 (and derivatives thereof) and W303, both prototrophic
for arginine and lysine. Yeast were cultured in synthetic complete
(SC) medium containing 0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino
acids, 0.5% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, CSM-Arg-Lys amino acid dropout
mix (Sunrise Science Products), l-arginine and l-lysine (50 mg/L each), and 3% (w/v) glycerol/0.02% (w/v) glucose,
or 2% (w/v) galactose as carbon source. For growth on 2% (w/v) glucose,
the medium was supplemented with l-histidine, l-leucine, l-methionine, l-tryptophan, adenine, and uracil (20
mg/L each) instead of the CSM amino acid dropout mix. l-Proline
(200 mg/L) was added as indicated. Metabolic labeling was performed
using stable isotope-coded “heavy” arginine (13C6/15N4; Arg10) and lysine (13C6/15N2; Lys8) or “medium-heavy”
arginine (13C6/14N2; Arg6)
and lysine (2H4; Lys4) instead of the “light”
counterparts.

Preparation of Samples for Mass Spectrometry
Aliquots
of whole cell lysates and mitochondria-enriched fractions were proteolytically
digested using LysC, trypsin, or a combination of both proteases.
Tryptic peptides obtained from whole cell extracts of unlabeled cells
were chemically labeled using stable isotope dimethyl-labeling. Proteolytic
peptides of whole cell extracts derived from mixtures of differentially
light, medium-heavy, and heavy SILAC-labeled cells were fractionated
(8 fractions) by high pH reversed-phase chromatography. For more details,
see Supporting Information.

Mass Spectrometry
and Data Analysis
Peptide mixtures
were analyzed on an LTQ Orbitrap XL or a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). For protein identification
and relative quantification, mass spectrometric raw data were processed
using the software MaxQuant/Andromeda.25,26 Database searches
were performed against all entries of the Saccharomyces Genome Database (http://www.yeastgenome.org/; downloaded September
2011). Detailed information and specific parameters for MS and data
analysis are given in Supporting Information.

Results and Discussion
Effects of Exogenous Arginine and Lysine
on the Amino Acid Metabolism
of Prototrophic Yeast
To analyze the effects of exogenously
added arginine and lysine on the yeast proteome, we selected the S. cerevisiae strains BY4741, on which many commonly
used yeast collections are based,16−20 and W303, which was previously used for nSILAC.22 We grew cells in the presence and absence of
unlabeled arginine and lysine using glucose as carbon source and quantitatively
compared their proteomes by LC-MS following peptide stable isotope
dimethyl labeling (n = 3). Enzymes of the α-aminoadipate
pathway of lysine biosynthesis (i.e., Lys1, Lys2, Lys4, Lys9, Lys12,
Lys20, and Aco2) were considerably decreased in both BY4741 and W303
cells (Figure 1a,b, Tables S-1 and S-2). These changes in protein abundance result from feedback inhibition
of the lysine biosynthesis, in which the expression of the respective
genes is repressed by lysine.22,27

and lysine biosynthetic enzymes in prototrophic

In BY4741 cells, exogenous
arginine led to a significant downregulation
of numerous enzymes of the arginine biosynthesis pathway (Arg1, Arg3,
Arg5/6, Arg8, and Cpa1; Figure 1a, Table S-1). The biosynthesis
of arginine starts with the acetylation of glutamate to form N-acetylglutamate,
which is ultimately converted to ornithine via the acetylated derivatives
cycle28,29 (Figure 1c). These first five steps of the arginine biosynthesis
occur in the mitochondrial matrix29 and
are catalyzed by the acetylglutamate synthase (Arg2), the acetylglutamate
kinase/N-acetyl-γ-glutamyl-phosphate reductase (Arg5/6), the
acetylornithine aminotransferase (Arg8), and the mitochondrial ornithine
acetyltransferase (Arg7). Arg7 is a bifunctional enzyme that may also
catalyze the acetylation of glutamate.30 Ornithine is exported into the cytosol via the ornithine transporter
Ort1 in the inner mitochondrial membrane30 and converted to arginine in three steps that require the enzymes
ornithine carbamoyltransferase (Arg3), arginosuccinate synthetase
(Arg1), and argininosuccinate lyase (Arg4). Alternatively, arginine
can be produced from cytosolic glutamine, which is converted to citrulline
via carbamoyl phosphate by the arginine-specific carbamoyl phosphate
synthetase Cpa1 and Arg3. Except for Arg2, all enzymes required for
arginine biosynthesis were identified in our study of BY4741 cells
(Figure 1a, Table S-1). We hypothesize that Arg2 eluded detection
because its abundance is very low (∼100 molecules per cell),
while Arg7, for example, is approximately 180-fold higher expressed
(∼18000 molecules per cell) in cells grown on glucose.1

S. cerevisiae is able to import
exogenous arginine, preferentially via the arginine permease Can1,31,32 and, to a minor extent, through its paralog Alp133,34 and the general amino acid permease Gap134,35 located in the plasma membrane (Figure 1c). In case of excess availability, free
cytosolic arginine is either transported into the vacuole via the
permease Vba2 (Figure 1c),32,36 or converted to proline.37,38 The arginase Car1 and the ornithine aminotransferase Car2, which
catalyze the initial steps of the arginine-to-proline degradation,37,38 were considerably upregulated in BY4741 cells (Figure 1a,c, Table S-1), indicating that the conversion is higher in cells grown
with exogenous arginine.

Arginine biosynthesis and degradation
are tightly balanced in S. cerevisiae, allowing the organism to adapt to
varying nutritional conditions. Free arginine is known to repress
genes involved in arginine biosynthesis,39 whereas CAR1 and CAR2 are positively regulated by arginine.40 This fits our observation that levels of proteins
involved in arginine biosynthesis are reduced and Car1 and Car2 are
increased (Figures 1a, c, Table S-1). The arginine-dependent
regulatory mechanism in S. cerevisiae relies on the ArgR protein complex, a transcription factor, which
in a complex with Mcm1 directly senses the concentration of arginine
and affects the abundances of distinct arginine metabolic enzymes41 (Figure 1d). The reduced levels of arginine biosynthetic enzymes observed
in BY4741 cells grown with arginine (Figure 1a,c) suggest that the cells preferably use
the arginine supplied with the medium, which, after import, leads
to shutdown of arginine biosynthesis by repression of arginine-sensitive
genes of this pathway (Figure 1d). W303 cells differ from BY4741 cells by a loss-of-function
mutation in the CAN1 gene.42 As a consequence,
import of exogenous arginine is impaired, which is in line with our
finding of virtually unaltered levels of arginine biosynthetic enzymes
in cells grown with or without exogenous arginine (Figure 1b, Table S-2).

In summary, our data suggest that the lysine and
arginine prototrophic
strain BY4741 can be used for metabolic labeling using both heavy
arginine and lysine, in the following referred to as “2nSILAC”,
while W303 cells are only amenable to labeling with heavy lysine.

Quantitative Labeling of Prototrophic BY4741 Cells with Heavy
Arginine and Lysine
We monitored the incorporation of stable
isotope-coded arginine (Arg10) and lysine (Lys8) into the proteome
of BY4741 grown on different carbon sources. In addition to glucose
(2%; fermentable conditions), we used 3% glycerol/0.02% glucose (nonfermentable
conditions) and 2% galactose (alternative carbon source), which are
commonly used to study mitochondria in S. cerevisiae. Cells were harvested at different times during growth (i.e., at
OD600 of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and ∼4.0) to assess Arg10/Lys8
incorporation by LC-MS (n = 3). For precultured BY4741
cells, we determined an incorporation of 65–90% with lysine
generally exhibiting a higher incorporation than arginine (Figure 2a–c, t0; Table S-3). In
BY4741 cells harvested at early to mid log phase (OD600 0.5–1.5) incorporation of Arg10/Lys8 increased to >98%
for
all carbon sources tested. At a higher OD600 of ∼4,
incorporation of Arg10/Lys8 was decreased in cells grown in glucose
and galactose, while it remained high (>98%) in BY4741 cells grown
on glycerol. In agreement with their genotype, W303 cells efficiently
incorporated Lys8 (>98%) but not Arg10 (Figure 2d; Table S-3).

Figure 2 Metabolic
incorporation of heavy arginine (Arg10) and lysine (Lys8)
into proteins of BY4741 and W303 cells during growth on different
carbon sources as indicated (a–d). Overnight cultures were
diluted to an OD600 of 0.025, cells were taken immediately
after dilution (t0) and at different ODs (0.5, 1.0, 1.5,
∼4) and analyzed by LC-MS. Incorporation of Arg10 and Lys8
per condition and OD were calculated based on 8333–21267 peptide
features (for more details, see Supporting Information and Table S-3). Error bars, standard
deviation (n = 3); gal, galactose; glc, glucose;
gly, glycerol.

Taken together, these
data confirm that the strain BY4741 preferentially
uses exogenous arginine and lysine, making it well applicable for
2nSILAC of yeast under fermentable and nonfermentable growth conditions.
However, since distinct growth conditions or genetic modifications
of BY4741 may affect labeling efficiencies for heavy SILAC amino acids,
complete incorporation of SILAC amino acids should routinely be checked.

Suppression of Arginine-to-Proline Conversion
To examine
the extent of arginine-to-proline conversion in BY4741, cells were
grown in the presence or absence of unlabeled proline.13 Quantitative proteome analysis did not reveal
an effect of exogenous proline on the abundance of enzymes involved
in proline biosynthesis (Pro1, Pro2, Pro3)43,44 or the conversion of arginine to proline (Car1, Car2, Pro3)37,38 (Figure S-1a,b and Table S-4).

Without exogenous proline, we generally
observed a higher number of Pro6-containing peptides of up to 16%
(Tables 1 and S-3; see Supporting Information for details about the determination of arginine-to-proline conversion).
Adding proline largely prevented heavy arginine-to-proline conversion,
and at an OD600 of 0.5–1.5, less than 5% of all
identified peptides contained Pro6. At a higher OD600 of
4.0, however, conversion increased to up to 8.9% of Pro6-containing
peptides under galactose condition (Tables 1 and S-3), which
needs to be taken into account when 2nSILAC is used for addressing
biological questions that require culturing of yeast to a higher OD,
for example in aging experiments. Similar results were obtained when
peptide intensities were used for the calculation of arginine-to-proline
conversion (Table S-5 and Figure S-2). Thus, to minimize the metabolic conversion of
heavy arginine to heavy proline and thereby ensure a most accurate
relative protein quantification, it is essential to add unlabeled
proline to the growth medium. Furthermore, our data indicate that
it is advisable to routinely check the extent of arginine-to-proline
conversion. In addition, performing label-switch experiments has been
shown to counterbalance quantification inaccuracies based on arginine-to-proline
conversion.67

2nSILAC for Global Proteome Quantification
in S. cerevisiae
To assess
2nSILAC for global
proteome quantification in S. cerevisiae, we grew cells under respiratory conditions and labeled them with
either light, medium-heavy, or heavy lysine only (Lys0/4/8; nSILAC)
or both arginine and lysine (Arg0/6/10, Lys0/4/8; 2nSILAC) in a triple
labeling experiment. We mixed cells in defined amounts (6:1.5:1 [L/M/H]; n = 4) followed by protein digestion and LC-MS analysis.
For nSILAC, we used the protease LysC, for 2nSILAC trypsin or a combination
of both proteases. A total of 2191 proteins were identified, of which
1879 (85.8%) were detected in all three approaches (Figure 3a, Table S-6). Most proteins (93, 4.2%) were exclusively identified
using LysC/trypsin. 2nSILAC resulted in significantly higher numbers
of peptides (16783 ± 737 for LysC/trypsin and 15265 ± 567
for trypsin) compared to “lysine only” labeling with
LysC digest (11789 ± 844; Figure 3b, Table S-6), while numbers
of proteins identified and quantified were similar between all three
approaches (1864 ± 70 to 1901 ± 44 proteins identified;
1801 ± 70 to 1806 ± 32 proteins quantified; Table S-6). The average sequence coverage of
quantified proteins was consistently higher following LysC/trypsin
tandem digestion, considering both the overall set of proteins (“total”)
and proteins grouped according to their subcellular localization (Figure 3c, Table S-6), which is in line with the observation that this
approach provided the highest number of peptides (Figure 3b).

for quantitative proteome analysis. BY4741
cells labeled with stable isotope-coded lysine (Lys4, Lys8) only or
lysine and arginine (Arg6, Arg10) and unlabeled cells (Arg0, Lys0)
were mixed 6:1.5:1 (L/M/H; n = 4). Proteins were

of both proteases in case of 2nSILAC. (a, b) Overlap of proteins (a)

We next examined the accuracy
of quantification (Figure 3d; Table S-6). At a low mixing ratio of 1.5:1, median ratios (1.44–1.56)
were close to the expected ratio for all three approaches. At higher
mixing ratios, however, the median ratios determined for the LysC/trypsin
tandem digest in 2nSILAC experiment (4.76 and 7.39) showed a lower
deviation from the expected ratios compared to values obtained with
the other approaches (LysC, 3.21 and 4.44; trypsin, 4.96 and 7.48).
The data further show that in 2nSILAC experiments, the precision of
the data was consistently higher than in nSILAC experiments as reflected
by a smaller interquartile range (Figure 3d). Taken together, 2nSILAC is well applicable
to global proteome quantification of BY4741 cells and best combined
with LysC/trypsin digestion to enhance sequence coverage and precision
of quantification.

2nSILAC Applied to the Study of Gene Deletion
Effects on the
Mitochondrial Proteome
As proof of principle, we employed
the 2nSILAC strategy to analyze global effects of gene deletions on
the mitochondrial proteome. BY4741 wild-type cells and cells with
deletion of a distinct mitochondrial gene were grown under nonfermentative
conditions. Following 2nSILAC labeling of wild-type and deletion strains
(n = 3 each; incorporation >98% for both heavy
arginine
and lysine, Figure S-3 and Table S-7), cells were mixed and mitochondria-enriched
fractions were prepared by differential centrifugation using a small-scale
protocol which we specifically developed to allow for fast processing
of multiple strains in parallel from low-volume cultures (see Supporting Information for experimental details).
Proteins were digested with LysC/trypsin for LC-MS analysis and statistical
outlier analyses were performed to determine proteins significantly
altered in abundance in the gene deletion cells (see Supporting Information). Quantitative MS data were corroborated
by immunoblotting using antibodies specifically recognizing mitochondrial
proteins.

Deletion of SDH5, which codes for an assembly factor
of the succinate dehydrogenase complex45 (complex II of the mitochondrial respiratory chain), resulted in
reduced levels of all four core components of complex II (Sdh1–Sdh4)
while proteins of complex III (Rip1), complex IV (Cox2), and the F1F0-ATP synthase
(Atp2, Atp17) were not affected (Figure 4a,b; Table S-8). Sdh5 is a highly conserved mitochondrial protein that is required
for the flavinylation of Sdh1,45 which
in turn is necessary for assembly and stability of complex II46 as underscored by our 2nSILAC-MS and immunoblot
data. In line with these data, results of a Gene Ontology (GO) term
enrichment analysis indicates that the components of the succinate
dehydrogenase complex were significantly decreased in abundance in sdh5Δ cells (Figure S-4a, Table S-9). Interestingly, the mitochondrial
protein Fmp16 was strongly upregulated (>4-fold) upon SDH5 deletion
(Figure 4a; Table S-8). Its exact molecular function is still
unknown but it has been reported to be of higher abundance in cells
undergoing stress.47,48 Our data indicate a potential
role for Fmp16 in cellular stress response to dysfunctional mitochondria
lacking complex II of the respiratory chain.

mitochondria-enriched fractions of WT and coi1Δ
cells were analyzed by blue native PAGE and immunoblotting using antisera
against Rip1 (complex III) and Cox1 (complex IV) decorating the respiratory

Phb1 and Phb2 form the ring-shaped 1.2-MDa prohibitin complex
in
the inner mitochondrial membrane,49 which
has been described to play a role in mitochondrial membrane organization,
lipid homeostasis and mitophagy.50,51 2nSILAC analysis
of phb1Δ cells revealed that the level of Phb2
was drastically reduced when PHB1 was deleted (Figure 4c and Table S-10). According to the immunoblot analysis shown in Figure 4d, Phb2 was virtually absent
in phb1Δ cells, which is in agreement with
previous data showing an interdependence of Phb1 and Phb2: loss of
Phb1 leads to destabilization of Phb2 and vice versa.52 Mic10, a component of the mitochondrial contact site and
cristae organizing system, which has been reported to interact with
prohibitin,53 was not affected by PHB1
deletion similar to the mitochondrially encoded subunits of the respiratory
chain complexes54 (Figure 4c,d and Table S-10). Moreover, our quantitative analysis of the mitochondrial proteome
shows that the cytochrome c oxidase (COX, CIV) regulatory
subunit Cox13 was decreased upon PHB1 deletion, revealing a specific
functional connection between the prohibitins and the respiratory
chain apart from mitochondrial protein synthesis (Figure 4c,d).55 Interestingly, GO term enrichment analysis of proteins with increased
abundance in crude mitochondrial fractions of phb1Δ cells shows an overrepresentation of proteins involved in
cytoplasmic translation (Figure S-4b and Table S-9), which functionally links the prohibitins
to the translation apparatus in the cytosol.

Coi1/Mco13 is a
∼13 kDa inner membrane protein with a C-terminal
intermembrane space domain with an increased expression (up to 200%)
upon respiratory growth.1,56Coi1Δ cells show a severe respiratory growth defect, a reduced
mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ), and the major interaction
partners of Coi1 are subunits of the respiratory chain complexes III
and IV.56 Singhal et al. (2017) analyzed coi1Δ mitochondria and detected reduced steady state
protein amounts of Cox2 (complex IV), Qcr6, and Cor1 (complex III),
further inner and outer membrane proteins and proposed a role of Coi1
as respiratory chain supercomplex assembly factor. However, the analysis
of deletion mutants of other respiratory chain supercomplex assembly
factors like Rcf1, Rcf2, Rcf3, and Aim24 did neither display such
severe growth defects, nor such a broad reduction of mitochondrial
protein steady state levels compared to coi1Δ.57−61 Therefore, we analyzed the role of Coi1 and grew wild-type and coi1Δ cells on respiratory medium, isolated mitochondria,
and performed Western blot analysis. We also observed a severe reduction
of Cox2 levels as Singhal et al. (2017) and additionally a significant
reduction of the cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV)
subunits Cox12 and Cox13 (Figure 4e). In contrast, we did neither observe a reduction
for the cytochrome c reductase (complex III) subunits
Cor1, Cyt1, Rip1, Qcr6, and Qcr8, nor for other inner or outer mitochondrial
membrane proteins. To unambiguously quantify mitochondrial protein
levels, we performed a 2nSILAC analysis with wild-type and coi1Δ cells. We observed a significantly decreased
abundance of four subunits of the cytochrome c oxidase (Cox2, Cox12,
Cox13, and Cox26) in coi1Δ cells (Figure 4f), while the remaining
components and associated proteins of complex IV (marked in red in
the scatterplot) as well as proteins of complex III (marked in orange)
that have been quantified in this data set were unaltered in abundance
(see also Table S-11). This quantitative
analysis demonstrates that COI1 deletion does not affect the biogenesis
of the cytochrome c reductase (complex III), but
specifically affects the biogenesis of the cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV). This is supported by results of a GO term
enrichment analysis showing that exclusively components of complex
IV are of reduced abundance in coi1Δ cells
(Figure S-4c and Table S-9). To further demonstrate the specificity of the defect
in coi1Δ, we used blue native PAGE to analyze
assembled respiratory chain complexes. When mitochondria are solubilized
with the mild detergent digitonin, antibodies directed against Rip1
(complex III) and Cox1 (complex IV) reveal a dramatic reduction of
respiratory supercomplexes in coi1Δ, as observed
by Singhal et al. (2017; Figure 4g, upper panels). Concomitantly, we observed increased
levels of assembled complex III (III2) by α-Rip1
decoration in coi1Δ. To analyze the levels
of individual respiratory chain complexes III and IV, we employed
the detergent n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside
(DDM), which is known to dissociate complex III and complex IV.59,62 We observed similar levels of complex III (α-Rip1) and a significant
reduction of complex IV (α-Cox1) in coi1Δ
compared to wild-type (Figure 4g, lower panels). In addition, we observed Cox1 subcomplexes
(IV*) in coi1Δ, which could represent intermediates
lacking Cox2. This native PAGE Western decoration confirms the results
of our 2nSILAC analysis and we propose that Coi1 acts as a specific
assembly factor for the cytochrome c oxidase (complex
IV). COI1 deletion causes a specific reduction of the major catalytic
core subunit Cox2, its partner protein Cox2663,64 and the two auxiliary subunits Cox12 and Cox13, which are not required
for catalytic activity.55,65 Since the Coi1 copy
number per cell is ∼10% compared to the subunits Cox2, Cox26,
Cox12, and Cox13 affected by COI1 deletion,1 we speculate that Coi1 functions as assembly factor to support the
efficiency of Cox2 biogenesis.

Conclusions
The
2nSILAC strategy that we describe here is a valuable addition
to the quantitative proteomics toolbox. We demonstrate its feasibility
by labeling the prototrophic S. cerevisiae strain BY4741 with heavy lysine and arginine under different growth
conditions. Most importantly, since a large variety of yeast mutant
strain collections are derivatives of BY4741, 2nSILAC allows for their
direct utilization in SILAC experiments without the necessity for
prior genetic manipulations, which may introduce artifacts and interfere
with further analysis. Thus, it offers researchers high flexibility
in the experimental design while still providing the full potential
of metabolic labeling in yeast, that is, mixing of samples at the
level of whole cells, to minimize experimental variations resulting
in more accurate quantitative proteome data.

In this work, 2nSILAC
was combined with a fast and cost-effective
protocol for the purification of mitochondria from low culture volumes.
The high applicability of 2nSILAC for the study of mitochondrial protein
functions was demonstrated by analyzing mitochondrial gene deletion
strains. The analysis of deletion cells lacking the respiratory chain
complex II assembly factor Sdh5 and the prohibitin subunit Phb1 revealed
the specificity and potential of the 2nSILAC methodology. In addition,
we analyzed the role of Coi1, and the quantitative data of 2nSILAC
suggests a specific role of Coi1 for the biogenesis of the core subunit
Cox2 of the cytochrome c oxidase (respiratory chain complex IV). Further,
2nSILAC is compatible with purification strategies for any subcellular
compartment and, thus, generally represents a universal approach for
studying protein functions at the organelle to whole-cell level. Since
2nSILAC can directly be applied to existing yeast strain collections
we believe it will help to boost systematic quantitative screens of
(sub)proteome-wide gene deletion effects in many laboratories, thereby
advancing research on eukaryotic protein functions.
