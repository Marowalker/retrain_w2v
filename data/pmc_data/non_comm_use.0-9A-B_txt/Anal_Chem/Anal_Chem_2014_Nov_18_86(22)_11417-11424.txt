Combining specific recognition capabilities
with the excellent
spatiotemporal resolution of small electrodes represents a promising
methodology in bioanalytical and chemical sensing. In this paper,
we report the development of reproducible electrochemical, aptamer-based
(E-AB) sensors on a gold microelectrode platform. Specifically, we
develop microscale sensors (25 μm diameter) for two representative
small molecule targets–adenosine triphosphate and tobramycin.
Furthermore, we report on the challenges encountered at this size
scale including small-magnitude signals and interference from the
irreversible reduction of dissolved oxygen and present methods to
circumvent these challenges. Through the electrochemical deposition
of dendritic gold nanostructures, we demonstrate microscale sensors
with improved performance by increasing signal-to-noise and consequently
sensitivity. Finally, we report on the use of the nonspecific adsorption
of serum proteins as an additional layer of surface passivation for
stable sensor performance. The sensor development here represents
general guidelines for fabricating electrochemical, folding aptamer-based
sensors on small-scale electrodes.

Electrochemical
methods have
attracted tremendous focus and efforts as a core analytical tool in
the design of chemical and biological sensors.1−6 This focus is a result of the combined selectivity and sensitivity
that electrochemical interrogation affords. The development of micro-
and nanoelectrodes has further pushed electrochemical sensing into
new space and time domains. Small-scale electrodes, with a critical
dimension approaching that of the diffuse layer (radius of <∼25
μm)7 offer advantages such as fast
mass transfer, small RC time constants, and low ohmic drops all of
which provide exceptional spatiotemporal resolution over macroscale
electrodes.7,8 With these improvements, small-scale electrodes
have found utility in scanned probe techniques, such as scanning electrochemical
microscopy (SECM),9−12 single-cell measurements,13−15 and in vivo measurements.16−18 To add further functionality, electrode surface modification can
add specific analyte recognition. As such, microelectrodes and nanoelectrodes
have been modified with enzymes19−21 and nucleic acids22−26 for the development of sensitive biosensors.

Relying on the
promising attributes of electrochemical detection
schemes, aptamer-based recognition has become a popular method to
impart chemical specificity into chemical and biochemical sensors.
Aptamers are short DNA or RNA sequences selected in vitro to bind
a specific target.27,28 Coupled with electrochemical
detection, electrochemical, aptamer-based (E-AB) sensors represent
a class of sensors that is reagentless, reusable, rapid, sensitive,
and specific.29−32 This class of sensor typically relies on a redox-labeled, electrode-bound
sensing aptamer to undergo a conformation and/or flexibility change
(i.e., fold) in the presence of target analyte (Scheme 1).33 The folding of the aptamer
alters the electron transfer efficiency between the distal-attached
redox probe and electrode surface and as such sensor signaling is
readily measured voltammetrically.34 There
are many reports of this class of sensor on large-scale electrodes
(2 mm diameter),30,31,35−40 however to the best of the authors’ knowledge, reproducible
and quantitative folding-based sensors on microelectrodes (critical
dimension of <∼25 μm) have not been reported.

Scheme 1 Electrochemical Aptamer-Based Sensors Utilize a Target-Induced Conformation
Change in the Aptamer to Generate Analyte Specific Changes in Signal
The target-induced conformation
change alters the efficiency with which a covalently attached redox
molecule (MB) can exchange electrons with the electrode surface. This
change in efficiency is readily measured using voltammetric methods.

In this Article, we combine the spatiotemporal
resolution of microelectrodes
and the chemical specificity of folding aptamer-based recognition
to create sensors with improved sensitivities over macroscale sensors.
Specifically, we report for the first time the use of 25-μm-diameter
gold electrodes as a platform for the fabrication of reproducible
E-AB sensors for two representative targets: adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) and the aminoglycoside antibiotic tobramycin. To circumvent
small sensor currents and large background currents, we electrodeposit
dendritic gold nanostructures to increase electrode surface area while
maintaining the microelectrode geometric footprint. We find that the
use of a nanostructured surface improves sensor performance in terms
of signal-to-noise and stability. Furthermore, we observe that employing
the microsensors in 100% undiluted fetal bovine serum decreases background
currents from the reduction of dissolved oxygen thus allowing for
improved sensor performance and demonstrate that the nonspecific adsorption
on serum proteins act to further passivate the electrode surface area.
As this is a work in progress, we highlight the challenges and prospects
of electrochemical, aptamer-based sensors built on small-scale electrodes.
The protocols presented here represent general guidelines for the
development of electrochemical sensors with unprecedented spatiotemporal
resolution and chemical specificity.

Materials and Methods
Materials
and Chemicals
Unless otherwise noted, all
chemicals and materials were used as received. 25-μm-diameter
gold wire (99.95%) and silver conductive adhesive paste were obtained
from Alfa Aesar. For microelectrode fabrication, soda lime glass capillaries
(LB16, 1.65 mm outer diameter, 1.10 mm inner diameter) and tungsten
rods (0.010 × 3 in.) were acquired from Dagan Corporation (Minneapolis,
MN) and A-M Systems, Inc. (Sequim, WA) respectively. Microcut discs
(240 grit, 600 grit and 1200 grit), microcloth, 1 μm monocrystalline
diamond solution, and 0.05 μm alumina micropolish for polishing
electrodes were purchased from Buehler (Lake Bluff, Il). Gold(III)
chloride trihydrate, hydrochloric acid (37%), sodium chloride, Trizma
base (2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1, 3-propanediol), magnesium chloride,
tris-2-carboxyethyl-phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP), 6-mercapto-1-hexanol
(99%), tobramycin sulfate salt, and fetal bovine serum were all used
as receive from Sigma-Aldrich without further purification. Solutions
were prepared using ultrapure water (Mili-Q Ultrapure Water Purification,
Milipore, Billerica, MA). Tris buffer contained 100 mM sodium chloride,
20 mM Trizma base and 5 mM magnesium chloride. Gold(III) electrodepositing
solution includes 1.2 mg/mL gold chloride, 1.5 wt % hydrochloric acid
and 0.1 M sodium chloride. Previously reported DNA aptamer probe sequences
(see below) were synthesized and purified using dual-HPLC (Biosearch
Technologies, Inc., Novato, CA).35,38,41,42 The aptamers were stored
at 200 μM in autoclaved 0.01 M EDTA aqueous solution (pH 8.0,
Sigma-Aldrich) at −20 °C until use. The aptamer sequences
adapted from the literature were modified at the 5′-end with
a six-carbon-thiol (HSC6) and at the 3′-terminus
with the redox active methylene blue (MB). Of note, the original tobramycin
aptamer reported in the literature is a RNA aptamer for aminoglycoside
antibiotics. The sequence used in this study is a DNA sequence previously
developed and demonstrated to specifically bind aminoglycoside antibiotics
by Rowe at al.35 ATP aptamer sequence:38 5′-HSC6-CTGGGGGAGTATTGCGGAGGAAA-MB-3′.
Tobramycin aptamer sequence:35 5′-HSC6-GGGACTTGGTTTAGGTAATGAGTCCC-MB-3′.

Microelectrode Fabrication
Gold microelectrode fabrication
was carried out using well-established methods.8,43−45 Briefly, a 25 μm-diameter gold wire was attached
to a tungsten rod using conductive silver epoxy. The gold–tungsten
assembly was then inserted into a soda lime glass capillary and then
the gold wire was sealed into the capillary using a natural gas-oxygen
flame. The other end of the assembly was secured with a resin epoxy.
Finally, the excess insulating glass is removed through manual polishing
on sand paper (from rough to fine grit) to expose a gold wire resulting
in a microdisk electrode with a 25 μm diameter.

Sensor Fabrication
and Interrogation
Electrochemical,
aptamer-based (E-AB) sensors were fabricated using an established
protocol with several slight modifications.36,37,39 Specifically, before surface modification,
the electrodes were manually polished on microcloth using 1 μm
monocrystalline diamond solution and 0.05 μm alumina micropolish
powder for 1–2 min each. Electrodes were sonicated for 5 min
after each polishing step to remove excess polishing particles. After
mechanical polishing, the electrodes were subjected to several electrochemical
cleaning steps by cycling the potential (−0.35 to 1.5 V vs
Ag/AgCl and ν = 100 mV/s) in a 0.05 M H2SO4 solution until a reproducible voltammogram was achieved. The cleaned
electrodes were then subjected to stepwise self-assembled monolayer
formation to create the E-AB sensor surface. The electrodes were modified
with a layer of thiolated aptamer probes by immersing the electrodes
into desired buffer solutions with aptamer concentrations of 1 μM
for 8 h or overnight (∼16 h) at room temperature for ATP or
tobramycin sensors, respectively. This step was followed by immersing
the electrodes into a 30 mM mercaptohexanol solution overnight (∼16
h) or 5 h to form a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of mercaptohexanol
to passivate the remaining electrode surface.46 These sensor fabrication conditions were determined vide infra to
be optimal for the respective sensor performance. For the nanostructured
electrodes, prior to sensor modification, clean electrodes were immersed
in a stirred solution of 1.2 mg/mL HAuCl4, 0.1 M NaCl,
and 1.5 wt % HCl. A pulsed waveform from 0.0 to −0.4 V (vs
Ag/AgCl) with a frequency of 1 Hz for 60 s is applied to reduce and
deposit gold onto the electrode surface.23,24,26,47 Finally, all
sensors were interrogated using squarewave voltammetry with a frequency
of 60 Hz, a pulse amplitude of 25 mV, and a voltage increment of 1
mV.

Results and Discussion
Combining the positive attributes
of microelectrodes with the specific
recognition capabilities of aptamer-based sensors represents a promising
bioanalytical sensing platform with improved spatiotemporal resolution
over traditional macroscale sensors. In this report, we employ two
representative faradaic folding-based E-AB sensors29 on both control planar microelectrodes (smooth surfaces)
and nanostructured microelectrodes. The signaling mechanism of the
sensors relies on a target-induced conformation or flexibility change
in the redox-labeled aptamer. This change alters the efficiency with
which the redox marker transfers electrons with the interrogating
electrode thus changing the faradaic current measured (Scheme 1).29,33 Salamifar and Lai recently reported
a similar detection methodology using E-DNA (or electrochemical, DNA-based
sensors) on nanometer-scale electrodes for the detection of complementary
DNA sequences. The electrodes are fabricated by depositing dendritic
gold nanostructures onto recessed platinum nanopore electrodes.26 The novel data presented by Salamifar and Lai
is qualitative, demonstrating signal change in the presence of complementary
DNA target strands. A common strength of folding-based E-DNA and E-AB
sensors is their ability to be regenerated as a result of their reagentless
nature.33 In the report by Salamifar and
Lai, however, sensor regeneration is problematic. In this report,
for the first time, we report on the successful development of reproducible
and quantitative folding-based E-AB sensors on small-scale electrodes.
We present a comprehensive study of the challenges and successes in
developing these sensors.

Planar Microelectrode-Based Sensors and the
Consequence of Oxygen
Reduction
Initial attempts at fabricating E-AB sensors on
25-μm-diameter planar microelectrodes were not successful. The
sensors failed as a result of both unstable square wave voltammetric
peak currents and large background currents. Specifically, the observed
peak current resulting from the reversible reduction of the tethered
methylene blue was typically small, on the order of several picoAmps
or lower, which was not discernible above background currents (Figure 1). While state-of-the-art potentiostats are capable
of measuring such currents, the problem is exacerbated by the appearance
of a large background current presumably a result of the irreversible
reduction of dissolved oxygen (Figure 1). Sensors
run in buffer without a deoxygenation step typically exhibit a wide
square wave voltammetric peak centered at ∼−0.34 V (vs
Ag/AgCl–although the peak potential often shifts). Similar
oxygen reduction peaks were observed at mercaptohexanol modified electrode
surfaces by Creager and Olsen.48 After
a deoxygenation procedure by purging buffer with nitrogen for 30 min,
this peak was eliminated (Figure 1). In turn,
a small-magnitude reduction peak is observed at ∼−0.25
V (vs Ag/AgCl) corresponding to the reduction of methylene blue (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Background current resulting from the reduction of dissolved
oxygen
overwhelms any observable current from the reversible reduction of
the tethered methylene blue. Planar microelectrode, electrochemical,
aptamer-based sensors exhibit large oxygen reduction peaks (black)
when employed directly in buffer solution. This peak interferes with
the methylene blue reduction peak. Deoxygenating the solution by purging
with nitrogen removes the oxygen reduction peak to yield small yet
observable methylene blue reduction peak (blue line and inset).

Unfortunately, the majority of
the sensors fabricated on planar
microelectrodes exhibit square wave voltammograms overwhelmed by the
observance of an oxygen reduction peak thus precluding any reproducible
quantitative measurements based on the faradaic signal from methylene
blue. Of note, we were able to observe qualitative changes in the
oxygen reduction peak current as a function of target ATP addition
(Figure 2). Sensors were fabricated with an
1 h incubation in 100 nM ATP aptamer followed by a 1 h modification
in 3 mM mercaptohexanol. The sensors respond to the addition of ATP
in a signal-off manner and can be regenerated (Figure 2). This signaling polarity is opposite from what is expected
for this aptamer-based sensor.38 The proposed
mechanism is that the conformation change in the aptamer affects the
accessibility of oxygen diffusing to the electrode surface and thus
creates a change in observable current similar to impedimetric-based
sensors employing redox markers.49−51 The folded aptamer further
blocks accessibility to the surface thus resulting in a decrease in
current. The sensor signal response based on oxygen reduction, however,
varies widely from sensor to sensor in terms of both magnitude and
peak potential (as seen in Figures 1 and 2) and was difficult to reproduce. This phenomenon
is currently under investigation by our laboratory, however we did
not pursue this as a viable method for target quantification in this
manuscript.

Figure 2 Changes in the current magnitude related to oxygen reduction can
potentially provide a sensing transduction mechanism for folding-based
E-AB sensors. Specifically, ATP sensors fabricated on planar gold
microelectrodes exhibit large oxygen reduction currents that change
in a signal off manner to the presence of ATP. The presumed mechanism
follows an impedance-like sensing mechanism in which the conformation
change alters the accessibility of oxygen reaching the surface to
generate faradaic current. Unfortunately, sensor-to-sensor variability
is too large thus precluding further measurements and is the subject
of current investigations.

The presence of the oxygen reduction peak indicates that
the passivating
monolayer is poorly packed leaving many defect sites, or accessible
sites for oxygen to be reduced.48,52,53 This poor packing reveals many surface sites that, on average, likely
represent a larger percentage of the overall surface area in contrast
to sensing monolayers formed on large-scale electrodes (on which E-AB
sensors function reproducibly).30,31,35−38,40 While several attempts were made
to improve the quality of the passivating monolayer through higher
thiol concentration and/or longer deposition times, we were unable
to consistently achieve low background signals. In addition, a more
robust passivating monolayer (e.g., longer chain alkanethiols)48,54,55 does not selectively reduce unwanted
background currents and thus signal from methylene blue reduction
was also impeded.

Microelectrodes with a Nanostructured Surface
are Suitable for
E-AB Sensor Fabrication
To circumvent the complication of
small sensor currents, we increased the electroactive surface area
of the interrogating microelectrode via the electrodeposition of dendritic
gold structures.24,25,47 Specifically, potentiostatic deposition of dendritic gold structures
using a gold chloride solution, previously described by Lai and co-workers,47 yields gold electrode surfaces with significantly
larger surface area (Figure 3 and S1 in Supporting Information). The deposition is achieved
by the reduction of gold onto the microelectrode surface while applying
a pulsed potential between 0.0 and −0.4 V (vs Ag/AgCl) in a
stirred gold chloride solution. The amount of gold and the nature
of the morphology is a function of the amount of time this potential
pulse is applied and the frequency of the application (pulsed or constant,
see Supporting Information Figure S1).
We determined vide infra that deposition of gold structures using
a pulsed waveform from 0.0 to −0.4 V with a frequency of 1
Hz for 60 s yields the most reproducible sensor surface out of the
conditions studied. This pulsed surface preparation protocol is used
for all later described experiments unless otherwise noted. Electrochemical
characterization of the gold nanostructured surfaces demonstrates
consistent and reproducible increases in the electroactive surface
area. Specifically, we use the gold oxide reduction peak obtained
via cyclic voltammetry in a 0.05 M H2SO4 to
quantify the surface area of the resulting electrode (Figure 3). Integration of the reduction peak area allows
calculation of the electrode surface area using a literature reported
value for the reduction of a gold oxide layer (400 μC/cm2).56 Our optimal deposition waveform
yields a 6.1 ± 1.6-fold increase in electroactive
surface area.

Figure 3 Electrodeposition of dendritic nanostructures increases
the electroactive
surface area of the gold microelectrode. Comparison of the gold oxide
reduction peaks in 0.05 M H2SO4 before (blue)
and after (black) deposition reveal an on average 6.1 ±
1.6-fold increase in electroactive surface area.

Microelectrodes with the deposited
gold nanostructures supports
improved sensor performance. E-AB sensors for the detection of ATP
fabricated on the nanostructured electrode surfaces exhibit significantly
larger currents associated with methylene blue reduction (Figures 4 and 5). Typical methylene
blue peak currents range from ∼50 pA to several hundred pA
which is likely a result of both the increased surface area of the
electrode as well as differences in the packing density and reduced
steric hindrance between neighboring probes because of the nanostructured
surface. Furthermore, while there is the foot of an oxygen reduction
peak at more negative potentials (<∼−0.35 V vs Ag/AgCl)
when the sensor is challenged in tris buffer, the methylene blue signal
is large in comparison. Still, with this improved signaling, the stability
of the sensor surface in tris buffer remained an issue (Figure 5 and Supporting Information Figure S2). Over time and successive voltammetric scans, we continued
to observe an increase in the oxygen reduction peak (Figure 5, left). This observation points again to the fact
that the integrity of the self-assembled monolayer remains a limiting
issue.57

Figure 4 Nanostructured gold microelectrodes are
suitable for the fabrication
of E-AB sensors. ATP sensors fabricated on nanostructured microelectrodes
exhibit increased current signal resulting from the reduction of methylene
blue reduction (black line) in comparison to the planar (blue line
and inset) 25 μm gold electrodes.

Figure 5 Employment of E-AB sensors for ATP detection directly in 100% undiluted
blood serum provides suppression of observable oxygen reduction current.
(Left) The background current results from the reduction of dissolved
oxygen in tris buffer increases over time and distorts signal results
from tethered methylene blue reduction. (Right) Conversely, sensors
challenged in undiluted serum maintain a stable background current
with suppressed current signal from the reduction of oxygen.

Blood Serum Suppresses
Oxygen Reduction Current
Sensors
fabricated on the nanostructured microelectrodes exhibit more stable
current and performance when employed directly in 100% undiluted serum.
Specifically, when the ATP E-AB sensors were employed directly in
serum we observe reproducible suppression of the current resulting
from oxygen reduction (Figure 5 right). After
a 120 min equilibration period in serum, during which the methylene
blue reduction peak magnitude also reduces (up to ≤∼40%)
to a stable value (presumably from nonspecific adsorption of serum
proteins), the baseline currents are more stable and free of background
signal from dissolved oxygen (Figure 5 right).
We discuss this observation in detail below.

Employment of micro-E-AB
sensors for the quantification of ATP directly in 100% undiluted serum
enabled reproducible, stable, and quantitative sensor measurements
(Figure 6). The sensors were prepared as described
above and after preparation, sensors were incubated in serum for ∼120
min. Upon addition of ATP to the serum, the methylene blue peak current
increased as expected (Figure 6, left and middle).
This increase in signal occurred monotonically with ATP concentrations
and was fit to a Langmuir-type binding isotherm by plotting the percent
signal change (percent signal change = ((i[ATP] – i0)/i0) × 100%) as a function of ATP concentration (Figure 6, middle). From the binding isotherm, we calculated
an observed binding affinity of 214 μM and a maximum percent
signal change of ∼80%. As a point of comparison, we prepared
sensors on macroscale electrodes (2 mm diameter) using the same modification
procedures. Interestingly, we find that the nanostructured microsensors
exhibited significantly enhanced binding affinity and sensitivity
(Figure 6, middle). Specifically, the macro
sensor yielded an observed binding affinity of 596 μM and maximum
signal change of ∼20%. Finally, the nanostructured sensors
also exhibited reproducible regeneration (Figure 6, right), demonstrating the reusability of the sensor. Throughout
these experiments, which typically lasted ∼8 h, we observed
no degradation of the methylene blue signal or increase in signal
from oxygen reduction.

Figure 6 Electrochemical aptamer-based ATP sensors based on microelectrodes
with dendritic nanostructures demonstrate enhanced and reproducible
performance in 100% bovine serum. (Left) Addition of ATP analyte results
in a quantitative increase in faradaic peak current from the reduction
of methylene blue. (Middle) The nanostructured 25 μm sensors
demonstrate an enhanced binding affinity and signal change in comparison
to sensors fabricated on 2 mm diameter electrodes using the same fabrication
procedure. (Right) Finally, these nanostructured 25 μm sensors
demonstrate reproducible performance. Signal can be regenerated by
rinsing with serum containing no ATP. All data represents the average
and standard deviation of at least three independent sensors.

To demonstrate the universality
of our microsensor approach, we
also developed sensors against aminoglycoside antibiotics using the
DNA-based aptamer described by Rowe et al.35 We observed the same challenges in developing microscale sensors
for aminoglycosides as we observed with the ATP sensors–low
and unstable current signals and large oxygen reduction background
signals. Using the modification procedures described above, we fabricated
microelectrode and macroelectrode sensors for the detection of the
aminoglycoside antibiotic tobramycin. When employed directly in serum,
the tobramycin sensor exhibited reproducible changes to the presence
of tobramycin in a signal-off manner as expected (Figure 7 left and middle).35 While
the microscale sensor did exhibit a slightly better sensitivity than
the macroscale sensors fabricated using the same conidtions, the difference
between the micro- and macroscale sensors is less pronounced than
what was observed with the ATP sensor. Nonetheless, the sensors are
reproducible when employed in 100% serum (Figure 7 right). After a ∼10% signal loss during the first
regeneration, the sensor was regenerated to nearly 100% of the original
signal at each subsequent challenge and regeneration (typical performance
of this class of sensor).58

Figure 7 Stable performance of
nanostructured microelectrode E-AB sensors
in 100% serum is a general trend. (Left and middle) Electrochemical
aptamer-based sensors for the detection of the aminoglycoside antibiotic
exhibits quantitatively decreased current signal to the presence of
tobramycin. (Middle) The nanostructured sensors exhibit slightly improved
sensitivity and similar binding affinity in comparison to sensors
fabricated on 2 mm diameter gold electrodes using the same fabrication
protocol (plotted as absolute value). (Right) Finally, the nanostructured
25 μm sensors demonstrate reproducible performance. Signal can
be regenerated by rinsing with serum containing no tobramycin protocol
(plotted as absolute value). All data represents the average and standard
deviation of at least three independent sensors.

The observance of improved sensor performance on nanostructured
electrodes is not unprecedented. Several reports by Kelley and co-workers
demonstrate that nanostructured surfaces enhance the capture ability
of immobilized DNA and thus leads to improved sensitivities.23−25 The hypothesis is that DNA immobilized onto nanostructured surfaces
reduces steric hindrance from neighboring probes. This morphology
thus allows higher accessibility of analyte to the nucleic acid, which
leads to better observed-binding affinity and sensitivity. It is still
unclear as to the origin of the difference in enhancement observed
between our ATP sensor and the tobramycin sensor. While it is only
speculative, the aptamer geometry and the nature of the conformation
change may affect sensor behavior.

Non-Specific Adsorption
of Proteins Passivates Defect Sites
in the Sensing Monolayer
We hypothesized that the nonspecific
adsorption of serum proteins acts to further passivate the electrode
surface by filling in monolayer defect sites. To test our hypothesis,
we fabricated sensors as discussed above for ATP and tobramycin on
the nanostructured electrode surface. The sensors were incubated in
a 30 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA) in buffer solution for 2 h followed
by sensor testing in the same solution to mimic tests in serum. BSA
is the main protein found in bovine serum (∼30 mg/mL)59 and is widely used for biosensor surface passivation
through nonspecific adsorption.60−64 Both the ATP and tobramycin sensors exhibited more stable methylene
blue-associated currents and reduced oxygen reduction backgrounds
(Figure 8). Furthermore, the sensors exhibited
reproducible performance responding and regenerating to challenges
with their respective targets (Figure 8). This
evidence supports the hypothesis that the nonspecific adsorption of
proteins to the surface of the electrode provides additional current
suppression. We should note sensors fabricated with the same modification
procedures that were incubated in a 30 mg/mL BSA in buffer solution
for 2 h, followed by sensor tests in tris buffer without BSA exhibited
unstable performance as indicated by an increase in the magnitude
of the oxygen reduction peak over time (data not shown). This suggests
that a continuous passivation is needed to protect the surface from
further degradation of the passivating monolayer–a problem
that does not appear to appreciably affect sensors on the macroscale.
Once again, this passivation is not selective. We typically observe
an <10% decrease in the methylene blue related signal after a 2
h incubation. This change is typically larger up to ∼40% when
the sensors are employed in serum. Nonetheless, this passivation sufficiently
suppresses current associated with oxygen reduction and thus enables
reproducible sensor performance.

Figure 8 Nonspecific adsorption of BSA suppresses
background currents from
oxygen reduction and enables stable, reproducible sensor performance
of microelectrode-based E-AB sensors. Specifically sensors fabricated
to target (left) ATP and (right) tobramycin are stable over long time
periods as indicated by the reproducible voltammograms. (Bottom left)
The ATP sensor shows an increase in peak current with the addition
of ATP and is able to be regenerated by immersion in BSA-containing
buffer without ATP. (Bottom right) Likewise, the tobramycin sensor
also exhibited regenerable signal with the presence and absence of
tobramycin.

Conclusion
In
this report, we describe the challenges and successes of fabricating
electrochemical, aptamer-based sensors using gold microelectrodes.
We demonstrated, for the first time, the reproducible performance
of folding-based E-AB sensors on microelectrodes using two representative
small-molecule aptamer sensors. Critical to the stable performance
of the resulting sensor is the integrity of the sensing self-assembled
monolayer on the electrode surface. This monolayer provides both the
recognition and signaling moiety (the redox labeled aptamer probe)
and a passivating layer (mercaptohexanol).46 Self-assembled monolayer chemistry enables the creation of a sensing
surface that is specific for the target of interest while suppressing
unwanted background currents nonfaradaic and faradaic alike. An observed
consequence of a poorly formed monolayer is the emergence of a large
faradaic background current resulting from the irreversible reduction
of dissolved oxygen. While some attempts were made to quantitatively
use this signal (see Figure 3), poor reproducibility
precluded this as a viable signal transduction mechanism. Improvements
in the passivating layer chemistries represent a challenge as well.
While better passivation leads to more suppression of unwanted currents,
it also suppresses the current associated with sensor signaling.

To facilitate the reproducible function of microelectrode-based
E-AB sensors, we use a nanostructured electrode surface created by
electrodeposition of dendritic-like gold structures, and we employ
the sensors directly in 100% undiluted blood serum. The increase in
surface area generates larger faradaic signal associated with the
reduction of methylene blue for sensor measurements. The employment
of the sensor in 100% blood serum results in the nonspecific adsorption
of serum proteins to create an additional passivation layer to block
unwanted background currents resulting from oxygen reduction.

Sensors built on small-scale electrodes (micro and nano) have the
ability to provide analytical measurements with excellent spatiotemporal
resolution and chemical specificity. Electrochemical, aptamer-based
sensors represent a class of sensors that are rapid, reagentless,
sensitive, and reusable with the ability to be applied to virtually
any target analyte. Building E-AB sensors on microelectrodes thus
has the potential to make significant impacts in the fields of chemical
and biochemical analysis. The sensors developed here provide a starting
point for the development of reproducible E-AB sensors on small-scale
electrodes.
