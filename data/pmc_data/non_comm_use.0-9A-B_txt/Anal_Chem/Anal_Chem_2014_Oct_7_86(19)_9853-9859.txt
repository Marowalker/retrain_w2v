Precise
reconstruction of heterotypic cell–cell interactions
in vitro requires the coculture of different cell types in a highly
controlled manner. In this article, we report a standing surface acoustic
wave (SSAW)-based cell coculture platform. In our approach, different
types of cells are patterned sequentially in the SSAW field to form
an organized cell coculture. To validate our platform, we demonstrate
a coculture of epithelial cancer cells and endothelial cells. Real-time
monitoring of cell migration dynamics reveals increased cancer cell
mobility when cancer cells are cocultured with endothelial cells.
Our SSAW-based cell coculture platform has the advantages of contactless
cell manipulation, high biocompatibility, high controllability, simplicity,
and minimal interference of the cellular microenvironment. The SSAW
technique demonstrated here can be a valuable analytical tool for
various biological studies involving heterotypic cell–cell
interactions.

==== Body
Cell culture
techniques have
greatly benefited various studies in biology, biochemistry, and biomedical
engineering, as well as providing in vitro platforms for drug screening
in the pharmaceutical industry.1−4 However, cells
residing in their in vivo niches experience a far more complex microenvironment
than those maintained in conventional cell culture; they interact
with neighboring cells, the extracellular matrix (ECM), and with soluble
factors present in the microenvironment.5 In particular, interactions among different types of cells are crucial
for the maintenance of normal cell function. For example, the interaction
with nonparenchymal cells helps preserve the liver-specific functions
of primary hepatocytes within coculture.6 To study heterotypic cell–cell interactions, cocultures of
different cell types are needed. Traditionally, different types of
cells are randomly mixed and grown together on cell culture plates
to form cell cocultures. According to differential adhesion hypothesis
(DAH), the differences in intercellular adhesiveness between different
cell types can drive the movement and assortment of cells.7,8 However, the organization of cell coculture arising from DAH is
governed by spontaneous rearrangement of cells with little control
on the final cell pattern. Therefore, engineering approaches that
offer on-demand control of cell arrangement are desirable for the
reconstruction of physiologically relevant in vivo multicellular microenvironment.9−11

To address the unmet needs of cell coculture techniques with
better
controllability, researchers have developed many cell coculture platforms
using micropatterned surfaces,12−26 cell printing,27−29 detachable substrates,30,31 physical barriers,32−35 microfluidic traps,36−38 and dielectrophoresis (DEP).39−41 Among these,
micropatterning techniques are the most widely used and generate organized
cell cocultures using an adhesion molecule- or microstructure-patterned
substrate surfaces.12−26 However, cell adhesion to the micropatterned surfaces is a passive
process with low controllability and cell behaviors within such cocultures
might be influenced by the artificially introduced substrate heterogeneity.
Cell-printing methods can actively deposit cells onto specific positions,
but they have relatively low patterning resolution.27−29 A recently
developed detachable substrate method enables reconfiguration of the
formed cell coculture but is not suitable for multicellular construction.30,31 Using solid microstructures as physical barriers or microfluidic
traps, researchers can control the positions of a group of cells or
single cells within coculture in microfluidic channels.32−38 These platforms have fine resolution and good control of local cellular
microenvironment,9 yet cells confined by
these microstructures may experience unwanted mechanical stimuli potentially
interfering with the study of heterotypic cell–cell interactions.
The introduction of contactless DEP forces for cell patterning can
overcome this limitation.39−41 However, for cell manipulation,
DEP methods require a specially prepared culture medium with low ionic
strength that is different from the cells’ in vivo microenvironment.
Thus far, a cell coculture technique with high biocompatibility, high
controllability, and minimal interference of the cellular microenvironment
has yet to be realized.

Previously, our group has used standing
surface acoustic waves
(SSAWs) to precisely manipulate various micro/nano-objects (e.g.,
beads, cells, droplets, nanowires, and microorganisms).42−46 In particular, in our early work we demonstrated that our SSAW platform,
the so-called acoustic tweezers technology, could create a pattern
of suspended cells from a single cell type.42 In this work, we introduce the phase-shift approach
and microfluidic cell culture technique to our SSAW cell-manipulation
platform and demonstrate SSAW-based cell coculture (i.e., patterning
of cultured cells from multiple cell types with desired
arrangement). Our SSAW-based cell coculture technique can position
multiple cell types using noninvasive, contactless acoustic forces
with high precision and high tunability. It also has the flexibility
to operate in literally any medium and with different types of adherent
cells. For the validation of our platform, we demonstrate a coculture
of epithelial cancer cells and endothelial cells and monitor the cell
migration dynamics within the coculture. In our platform, cell behaviors
(e.g., migration) are restricted by neither heterogeneous surface
modifications nor physical barriers, which is advantageous over existing
techniques (e.g., micropatterning, detachable substrates) in studying
cell–cell interactions. We expect that the SSAW-based cell
coculture platform demonstrated here will be a valuable tool for studying
cell–cell interactions, tissue engineering, and drug screenings.47−49

Working Mechanism
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate
the working mechanism of our SSAW-based cell coculture platform, which
is made by bonding a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microchannel between
a pair of interdigital transducers (IDTs) fabricated on a lithium
niobate (LiNbO3) piezoelectric substrate (Figure 1a). The pair of IDTs are aligned in parallel. When
a radio frequency (RF) signal is applied to both IDTs, two series
of identical surface acoustic waves (SAWs) propagating in opposite
directions will be generated. The interference between these two series
of SAWs forms a SSAW field,
with a periodic distribution of pressure nodes (with minimum pressure
amplitude) and pressure antinodes (with maximum pressure amplitude)
on the piezoelectric substrate.50−54 When the resonating SSAW encounters the liquid medium inside the
microchannel, it generates longitudinal-mode leakage waves, which
cause pressure fluctuations in the medium.

Figure 1 (a) Working mechanism
of our SSAW-based cell coculture platform.
(b) An optical image of our SSAW-based cell coculture device.

Figure 2 Schematics of the SSAW-based cell coculture
technique.

The primary acoustic radiation
forces that act on any particle
in the SSAW field can be expressed as55 1   2  where p0, λ, Vp, k, x, ρp, ρm, βp, and βm are the acoustic pressure,
wavelength, volume of the particle, wave vector, distance from a pressure
node, density of the particle, density of the medium, compressibility
of the particle, and compressibility of the medium, respectively.
Equation 2 describes the acoustic contrast factor, ϕ, which determines whether the particles move to
pressure nodes or antinodes in the SSAW field: the particles will
aggregate at pressure nodes if ϕ is positive and antinodes if
ϕ is negative. The cells suspended in the medium will experience
acoustic radiation forces caused by the pressure fluctuations and
will be pushed toward pressure nodes in the SSAW field due to their
positive acoustic contract factor.

As shown in Figure 1a, when the RF signal
is on, cells suspended in the culture medium inside the microchannel
will be aligned in parallel lines in the established SSAW field due
to the acoustic radiation forces. When the RF signal is off, cells
eventually settle down inside the microchannel and, in the absence
of external flow, maintain their original pattern. Eventually, these
cells will attach to the surface of the piezoelectric substrate forming
a patterned cell culture. To form an organized cell coculture, different
types of cells need to be patterned in different positions, which
requires changing the distribution of pressure nodes and antinodes.
In an established SSAW field, this can be achieved by tuning the relative
phase between the RF signals applied to the pair of IDTs.56,57 With this phase-shift approach, different types of cells can be
patterned sequentially in different positions to form an organized
cell coculture.

Figure 2 is a schematic
of this phase-shift
approach to forming cocultures of two cell types. First, cells of
type A are seeded into the microchannel and patterned by SSAW (Figure 2, parts a and b). After type A cells attach to the
bottom surface (Figure 2c), cells of type B
are introduced into the microchannel (Figure 2d). To pattern type B cells in different positions from type A cells,
we tune the relative phase between the RF signals applied to the pair
of IDTs by 180°. Thus, type B cells are patterned in between
type A cells with the same patterning period (Figure 2e). As a result, two types of cells will grow in alternate
lines after type B cells attach to form an organized cell coculture
(Figure 2f).

Materials and Methods
Device
Fabrication
Figure 1b
shows the optical image of our SSAW-based cell coculture device. To
fabricate the device, a double layer of chrome and gold (Cr/Au, 50
Å/500 Å) was deposited on a photoresist-patterned 128°
Y-cut LiNbO3 wafer (500 μm thick, double-side polished)
using an e-beam evaporator (RC0021, Semicore, U.S.A.), followed by
a lift-off process to form a pair of IDTs with a period of 300 μm.
A single-layer PDMS microchannel (12 mm long, 1 mm wide, and 100 μm
high) was fabricated by standard soft-lithography using SU-8 photoresist.
After holes for an inlet and outlet were drilled into the PDMS microchannel
with a Harris Uni-Core 1.00 mm punch, the PDMS microchannel was treated
with oxygen plasma in a plasma cleaner (PDC001, Harrick Plasma, U.S.A.)
for 3 min with the LiNbO3 substrate. The PDMS microchannel
was then aligned and bonded to the LiNbO3 substrate between
the IDTs. The entire device was then incubated overnight at 65 °C
and sterilized under UV light for 30 min. The surface of the LiNbO3
substrate inside the microchannel was then coated overnight with 100
μg/mL collagen I rat tail (Gibco, Life Technologies, U.S.A.)
in an ethanol solution before each experiment for better cell adhesion
and growth.

Experimental Setup and Data Acquisition
All of the
experiments were conducted on the stage of an inverted microscope
(TE2000-U, Nikon, Japan) with an installed microscope incubation system
(Chamlide TC, Live Cell Instrument, South Korea). In order to eliminate
the virtual image introduced by using a double-side polished LiNbO3 substrate, we placed a polarizer in the light path adjusted
at an angle. The SSAW is created by applying amplified RF signals
to the IDTs using a function generator (AFG 3102C, Tektronix, U.S.A.)
and power amplifier (25A250A, Amplifier Research, U.S.A.). A digital
phosphor oscilloscope (load set at 1 MΩ) (DPO4104, Tektronix,
U.S.A.) was used to determine the resonance frequency of the IDTs.
A syringe pump (KDS210, KD Scientific, U.S.A.) was used to infuse
fresh culture medium into the microchannel during long-term microfluidic
cell culture. A charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (ORCA-Flash 2.8,
Hamamatsu, Japan) was connected to the microscope for data acquisition.
Cell movement trajectories were extracted from time-lapse images and
analyzed using Nikon NIS-Elements Advanced Research (AR) software
and plotted using R. Welch two-sample t test was
conducted to compare cell movement data between two groups. All of
the other image processes were conducted using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda,
MD, U.S.A.).

Cell Culture and Staining
HeLa cells
were maintained
in DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco, Life Technologies, U.S.A.), supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Life Technologies, U.S.A.) and
1% penicillin–streptomycin (Mediatech, U.S.A.). Human dermal
microvascular endothelial (HMVEC-d) cells were purchased from ATCC
and maintained in EndoGRO-LS complete media (Millipore, U.S.A.). For
coculturing HeLa cells and HMVEC-d cells, EndoGRO-LS complete media
was always used as the culture medium. A CO2 incubator
(Nu-4750, NuAire, U.S.A.) was used to maintain a temperature of 37
°C and a 5% CO2 level during cell culture. CellTracker
Green CMFDA and CellTracker Orange CMRA (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies,
U.S.A.) were used to label cells with green and red fluorescence following
the manufacturer’s standard protocols. Cells grown to 80–90%
confluency were trypsinized (Trypsin-EDTA (0.05%), Gibco, Life Technologies,
U.S.A.), washed with PBS, resuspended in fresh culture medium to desired
cell concentrations, and seeded into the microchannel for the experiment.
After the cells were treated and cultured in our SSAW-based devices,
live/dead cell staining was conducted using Calcein AM and SYTOX orange
(Molecular Probes, Life Technologies, U.S.A.) to assess cell viability
in our device after being treated by SSAW and cultured in microfluidic
devices.

Results and Discussion
Culture of Patterned Cells
We first validated the ability
of our SSAW-based platform to create patterned cell culture. Micrographs
of patterned HeLa cells cultured for up to 24 h are shown in Figure 3a–e. During this experiment, we applied a
12.78 MHz RF signal with a voltage of ∼20 Vpp to HeLa cells
that were injected into the microchannel at a seeding density of 4
× 106 cells/mL. The resulting pattern of parallel
lines (Figure 3a) had a period of approximately
150 μm, which matched well with the half-wavelength of the applied
SAW (λ = ∼300 μm). After the cells were patterned
in the SSAW field, we turned off the RF signal and stopped the fluid
to allow the cells to settle down and adhere to the bottom surface
of the microchannel. Although the cells were subject to movement of
the residual flow before adhesion, this effect was minimal in the
microfluidic environment. As shown in Figure 3b, after 1 h of culture in the incubation system, the cells maintained
the original pattern, with only slight cell movement. The cell movement
during the adhesion process was due to cell growth and expansion on
the surface and did not affect cell patterns within 1 h of culture.
We also found that all of the cells had attached within 1 h of culture;
they were not flushed away by an external flow at this time point.
For long-term culture of the patterned cells, after 1 h we infused
fresh culture medium into the microchannel with a syringe pump at
a flow rate of 0.5 μL/min. Patterned HeLa cells were then cultured
in the SSAW-based microfluidic device with this continuous medium
infusion until the cells grew to full confluency at 24 h, as shown
in Figure 3c–e.

Figure 3 (a–e) Micrographs
showing culture of patterned HeLa cells
in our SSAW-based microfluidic device for up to 24 h. (f) Live/dead
staining results indicate that most of the HeLa cells remain viable
at the end of 24 h culture (green, live cells; red, dead cells).

During this phase of the experiment,
cells were exposed to the
SSAW field only during the patterning process and for less than 10
s. No obvious cell damage associated with acoustic exposure was observed
during the 24 h microfluidic cell culture. In addition, we conducted
live/dead cell staining using Calcein AM and SYTOX orange at the end
of the 24 h cell culture, as shown in Figure 3f. A count of the stained cells in three different SSAW-exposed areas
showed that 99.26% ± 0.38% of the cells remained viable at the
end of the 24 h culture, proving the noninvasive nature of our SSAW
technique.

The IDTs used in our experiment were designed to
have a fixed period
of 300 μm with a resonance frequency of 12.78 MHz, which was
used in all subsequent experiments to generate the best cell patterning
result. IDTs with different designs can be used to pattern cells with
different periods. Furthermore, it is also feasible to change the
period of cell patterning in a single device using tunable SSAW generated
from slanted-finger IDTs or chirped IDTs,43,46 which can give our SSAW-based cell coculture platform an even greater
degree of flexibility.

Coculture with Sequential Cell Patterning
After demonstrating
a patterned culture of a single cell type, we examined the possibility
of patterning and culturing multiple types of cells in one device.
In our experiment, we employed the aforementioned phase-shift approach
to form an organized coculture of two different cell types.

Figure 4 shows the experimental results validating
this approach. In this experiment, green and red fluorescently labeled
HeLa cells were used to represent two cell types. The green fluorescently
labeled HeLa cells (type A cells) were first introduced into the microchannel
at a seeding density of 4 × 106 cells/mL and patterned
under an RF signal of 12.78 MHz, 20 Vpp, and 0° relative phase.
After 2 h of culture with the SSAW off, the red fluorescently labeled
HeLa cells (type B cells) were injected into the microchannel at the
same seeding density. They were patterned under an RF signal of 12.78
MHz, 20 Vpp, but with a 180° relative phase. After another 2
h of culture with the SSAW off, fluorescent images were taken. As
shown in Figure 4a, the change of the relative
phase between the pair of IDTs from 0° to 180° will change
the cell-patterning positions between the two rounds of cell seeding
by switching between pressure nodes and antinodes. The fluorescent
images in Figure 4, parts b and c, show the
two groups of HeLa cells growing in patterned lines. From the merged
image in Figure 4d, we can see that the patterned
lines for the two groups of HeLa cells are in an alternate manner,
with a separation of less than 75 μm (one-fourth of the applied
SAW wavelength).

approach. (b) Green fluorescent image showing first-seeded HeLa cells.
(c) Red fluorescent image showing second-seeded HeLa cells. (d) Merged
image showing green and red HeLa cells grown in alternate lines.

In addition to its advantages
in high controllability, our SSAW-based
cell coculture platform requires only a small amount of cells. During
each round of cell patterning, usually only 2 μL of cell suspension
(approximately 4 × 106 cells/mL) was injected into
the microchannel using a pipet, which means that <1 × 104 cells were required for coculture reconstruction for each
cell type.

Investigation of Cancer Cell Movement during
Coculture
To further examine the functionality of our SSAW-based
cell coculture
platform, we explored the interactions between epithelial cancer cells
and endothelial cells in our system. For this study, we chose HeLa
cells and HMVEC-d cells as our biological model. Prior to studying
HeLa cell behaviors in coculture, we first explored patterned monoculture
of HeLa cells. In the control experiment (Figure 5, parts a and b), two groups of HeLa cells were first labeled
with green and red fluorescence, respectively. Then these two groups
of HeLa cells were sequentially seeded and patterned in our device
as described above. The seeding density for each round of patterning
was 3 × 106 cells/mL, and the interval between two
rounds of patterning was 1 h. Fluorescent images were then taken at
2 and 24 h time points. As shown in Figure 5a, green and red fluorescently labeled HeLa cells growing in alternate
lines were formed at 2 h. When the HeLa cells grew to confluency at
24 h, this pattern of alternate lines was not disrupted, indicating
that HeLa cell mobility in monoculture was low (Figure 5b). In our coculture experiment, we introduced green fluorescently
labeled HMVEC-d cells at the seeding density of 3 × 106 cells/mL during the first round of cell patterning and red fluorescently
labeled HeLa cells at the same seeding density after 1 h. At 2 h time
point of coculture shown in Figure 5c, we can
see that HMVEC-d cells and HeLa cells grew in alternate line regions.
However, at 24 h time point, the organized HeLa cell pattern was clearly
disrupted indicating high HeLa cell mobility when cocultured with
HMVEC-d cells (Figure 5d).

Figure 5 Fluorescent images of
(a and b) HeLa cell monoculture at 2 and
24 h and (c and d) HeLa and HMVEC-d coculture at 2 and 24 h in our
SSAW device.

In order to quantitatively
investigate HeLa cell movement within
monoculture or coculture, we cultured patterned HeLa cells when HMVEC-d
cells (in EndoGRO-LS complete media) were present or absent in our
SSAW device. As control experiments, off-chip monoculture and coculture
of HeLa cells were also conducted in which cells were randomly seeded
on a Petri dish. For coculture, HeLa cells were fluorescently labeled
with Calcein AM for identification and seeded before the HMVEC-d cells.
Time-lapse phase-contrast images were automatically taken every 20
min from 2 to 12 h for all the four groups (on-chip monoculture, on-chip
coculture, off-chip monoculture, and off-chip coculture) to record
cell positions. To analyze the cancer cell movements, we randomly
picked 30 HeLa cells in each group and tracked their trajectories
from 2 to 12 h. The time-lapse images with highlighted HeLa cell tracking
for all the four groups are available in Supporting
Information supplementary videos S1–S4.

Figure 6, parts a and b, shows three typical
cell trajectories for on-chip monoculture and coculture, which illustrate
that HeLa cells cocultured with HMVEC-d cells in our SSAW device had
higher mobility than those cultured alone. This increased HeLa cell
mobility was not caused by the higher cell density in on-chip coculture
because HeLa cells within confluent off-chip monoculture also showed
low level of mobility (Supporting Information supplementary video S3). The average movement path lengths of the
30 tracked HeLa cells at each time point in each group are plotted
in Figure 6c. At 12 h, the average movement
path lengths of the tracked HeLa cells in off-chip monoculture, on-chip
monoculture, off-chip coculture, and on-chip coculture were 66.4 ±
11.2, 64.8 ± 19.5, 146.1 ± 21.3, and 174.0 ± 24.6 μm,
respectively, as shown in Figure 6d. From the
comparison, we can see that the mobility of HeLa cells in coculture
is much higher than that in monoculture, either off-chip or on-chip.
This increased cancer cell mobility in coculture can be attributed
to the cross-talk initiated by endothelial cells, which enhances cancer
cell survival and mobility through STAT3/Akt/ERK, α5β1
integrin, and GTPases signaling pathways.58,59 The average movement path length of the tracked HeLa cells in on-chip
coculture was only slightly larger than in off-chip coculture, which
indicates that the presence of endothelial cells increases the mobility
of cancer cells either in a random coculture or in an organized coculture.
However, when we compared HeLa cell trajectories between these two
groups (Supporting Information supplementary
videos S2 and S4), we found that the movements of HeLa cells in the
two groups were different. In the organized on-chip coculture, HeLa
cells tend to migrate away from their original positions, while in
the random off-chip coculture, HeLa cells tend to wander around locally
so that their final positions at 12 h were close to their original
positions at 2 h. To illustrate this difference, we further plot the
average distances from the original positions for the four groups
at 12 h in Figure 6e. We can see that the average
distance from the original positions for on-chip coculture (48.7 ±
24.9 μm) was twice that in off-chip coculture (23.1 ± 16.4
μm). One possible explanation is that, compared with the random
cell arrangement in off-chip coculture, the organized cell arrangement
in on-chip coculture better facilitates gradient formation for the
signaling molecules secreted from HMVEC-d cells, which can guide HeLa
cells to migrate away from their original positions. These results
indicate that our SSAW-based cell coculture platform can be used for
in vitro evaluation of the invasiveness of cancer cells and can be
developed as an efficient tool for in vitro antitumor drug screenings.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a SSAW-based
cell coculture platform.
Our platform takes advantage of the contactless, noninvasive nature
of acoustic forces, thus exerting minimal interference on the cellular
microenvironment while preserving high cell integrity. The use of
contactless acoustic forces that pattern cells in a transient manner
is valuable because cells are free of any major external stimulus
(e.g., substrate heterogeneity, microstructure confinement, or mechanical
stimulation) during culture. Thus, the interference of the cellular
microenvironment by unwanted stimuli is minimized and the influence
of heterotypic cell–cell interactions can be isolated for study.60,61 The SSAW-based cell coculture platform demonstrated here provides
a novel analytical tool for real-time, dynamic observation of cell
behaviors within coculture. The cellular-level resolution makes our
SSAW-based cell coculture platform an excellent candidate for reconstructing
heterotypic cell–cell interactions, which is important for
probing cell communication and multicellular tissue construction.62−65
