In
this work, the use of fused deposition modeling (FDM) in a (bio)analytical/lab-on-a-chip
research laboratory is described. First, the specifications of this
3D printing method that are important for the fabrication of (micro)devices
were characterized for a benchtop FDM 3D printer. These include resolution,
surface roughness, leakage, transparency, material deformation, and
the possibilities for integration of other materials. Next, the autofluorescence,
solvent compatibility, and biocompatibility of 12 representative FDM
materials were tested and evaluated. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility
of FDM in a number of important applications. In particular, we consider
the fabrication of fluidic channels, masters for polymer replication,
and tools for the production of paper microfluidic devices. This work
thus provides a guideline for (i) the use of FDM technology by addressing
its possibilities and current limitations, (ii) material selection
for FDM, based on solvent compatibility and biocompatibility, and
(iii) application of FDM technology to (bio)analytical research by
demonstrating a broad range of illustrative examples.

==== Body
It is safe
to say that scientists
working in research laboratories are generally not self-sufficient
when it comes to conducting experiments, regardless of the field of
interest. For example, we all are dependent on external suppliers
for consumables and labware, which means that these materials must
be ordered periodically and in a timely fashion, often in bulk, and
stored somewhere before use. If experiments involve lab-on-a-chip
technology and instrumental techniques, we must often turn to a workshop
when it comes to things such as customizing a microscope stage (for
positioning a lab-chip, for example) or having clamping devices or
alignment tools made. If the workshop is busy (as workshops often
are), our experiment is delayed. Resorting to temporary solutions
such as duct tape to align and fix components to do that experiment
anyway generally just leads to additional delay. The iterative development
of a (bio)analytical device using “rapid” prototyping
approaches can be slowed significantly too if we are dependent on
external partners or companies to perform certain processing steps.
All these are recurring issues, or annoyances at the very least, to
which we have often had to resign ourselves in the prototypical microfluidics
laboratory. The bigger problem is, of course, that these inconveniences
cause us to be inefficient against our will, meaning they cost time
and money. Can we envision a world where we can shed our experimental
dependence on these kinds of external factors? Perhaps we can—at
least if we can master the new additive manufacturing techniques that
constitute 3D printing.

3D printing is not a new technology,
as it has been used in some
industrial settings for over 30 years. However, 3D printing systems
have tended to be very specialized and expensive until recently, making
them relatively inaccessible for most potential end users. In addition,
early equipment was often not very user-friendly, with long and relatively
unreliable printing processes being typical. The history of 3D printing,
as well as a comparative description of a number of different 3D printing
approaches, has been nicely summarized in recent reviews.1−6

In the past few years, we have seen a rapid increase in publications
on the use of 3D printing in (bio)analytical and microfluidics research.2 It has been used for the fabrication of channels,7−11 sample cartridges,12 and masters for
replication of channels in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS),13−16 hydrophobic patterning in paper microfluidics,17 and fabrication of labware and customized setups.18−25 Furthermore, 3D-printed materials have been studied to some extent
with respect to their physical properties9,26 and
biocompatibility in cell- or tissue-based assays.18,21,25,27 As optical
transparency is often a problem with 3D-printed lab-chip devices,
incorporation of glass slides into these devices has also been reported.25,27 These advances have been achieved with different 3D printing approaches,
namely, stereolithography (SL), fused deposition modeling (FDM), inkjet
3D printing, digital light processing (DLP), and selective laser sintering
(SLS). This means that the experience that researchers have with 3D
printing for device fabrication is somewhat fragmented. It would therefore
be useful to assess and characterize all these approaches individually,
to allow for a better comparison of approaches and selection of the
most suitable approach for a given application.

As a first step
in this direction, we focus in this paper on 3D
printing by FDM. We describe the technology and address its current
possibilities and limitations with respect to (bio)analytical devices and, more
generally, experimental research. Furthermore,
this work contains an extensive table in which several important properties
(including biocompatibility and solvent compatibility) of 12 representative
FDM materials are listed, to aid in material selection for specific
medical, biological, or chemical applications. Finally, we demonstrate
the applicability of FDM to the fabrication of (bio)analytical (micro)devices
and customization of experimental setups. All the examples in this
paper were designed, fabricated, and implemented in our laboratory
at the University of Groningen and are presented here to show the
impact that 3D printing has had on our own “microenvironment”.

Fused
Deposition Modeling
FDM is based on the melting and extrusion
of a polymer filament.
The filament is fed into and melted in a heated metal cylinder ending
in a nozzle. As fresh filament is supplied continuously into this
component, the molten polymer is pushed out of the nozzle, forming
a thread roughly the size of the nozzle diameter. To shape this thread
into a plastic part, the nozzle is placed above a metal plate (print bed) at a distance that depends on the desired resolution.
Upon exiting the nozzle, the filament is deposited on this print bed,
which can be heated to promote attachment. When the print bed and
nozzle are both controllably moved in perpendicular directions, we
can draw a two-dimensional figure on the print bed having the thickness
of one polymer thread. This thickness (generally between 0.1 and 0.3
mm) is controlled by (i) the distance between the nozzle and the print
bed and (ii) the ratio between the flow rate of the filament through
the nozzle and the printing speed. When the first layer is finished,
the print bed is lowered by a fixed distance (i.e., the thickness
of a single layer), and a second layer can be printed on top of the
original one. By repeating these steps, an object is created in an
additive manner.

To print a 3D-drawn model, it first needs to
be translated to a
file which guides printer operation. This process is described in
detail by Gross and co-workers.1 In short,
the 3D drawing (often a vector file) is saved in the *.STL format,
which is a triangular surface mesh. This file is then sliced into
a path for the extruder to follow (generating a G-code); the solid
model is thus converted into a digital equivalent of filament threads.

Materials
and Methods
Characterization of a Benchtop FDM 3D Printer
For the
fabrication of the devices in this work, a Felix v.3.0 (FELIX printers,
de Meern, The Netherlands, nozzle diameter 0.35 mm) was used. This
FDM 3D printer was chosen because of its open and accessible architecture.
SolidWorks (Waltham, MA) was used to design the 3D models for printing,
which were then sliced using sFact/Skeinforge freeware. Repertier
host freeware was used to control the 3D printer. We characterized
this printer by considering (i) the resolution, surface roughness,
and overhang, (ii) leakage prevention, (iii) the transparency, (iv)
combination of materials in one printed object, and (v) object warping
during printing (Supporting Information, protocols S1–S3).

Polymers for FDM 3D Printing
A number
of physical and
biological specifications of 12 FDM filament materials were assessed
in this study (Supporting Information,
protocols S4–S6). The materials with their respective printing
parameters are listed in Table S2, Supporting Information. These 12 materials are representative of commercially
available materials for FDM. They comprise different polymers and
have varying degrees of elasticity. The materials were tested for
(i) autofluorescence at three wavelengths (protocol S4), (ii) compatibility
with different solvents (water, methanol, acetonitrile, 2-propanol,
acetone) (protocol S5), and (iii) biocompatibility with a primary
cell model (human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)) and a
rat tissue model (precision cut liver slices (PCLSs)) (protocol S6).

Biocompatibility in the context of this study refers to the material
property that results in the viability of cells and tissue being unaffected
when exposed to the material under in vitro culture conditions. A
material that is not biocompatible will adversely affect cell or tissue
viability in its proximity to some extent, resulting in altered cell
behavior or even death. HUVEC cultures and PCLSs were exposed to the
different 3D-printed materials for 18 and 24 h, respectively. One
day of incubation is sufficient to assess whether the printed materials
are toxic for the tested in vitro models.28,29 Viability was assessed in HUVECs by microscopy and a test of metabolic
activity (MTT test); viability in PCLSs was assessed by quantifying
the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content and lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) leakage into the medium. A material was considered biocompatible
if the test results were not found to be statistically different from
the results of the control experiment.

Applications of FDM 3D
Printing
In the final part of
this work, we tested the applicability of FDM to a number of common
lab-on-a-chip/(bio)analytical applications. The applications that
are considered in this work are (i) channel fabrication, (ii) channel
replication in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), (iii) paper microfluidic
channel fabrication, and (iv) setup customization (Supporting Information, protocols S7 and S8).

Results
and Discussion
Characterization of a Benchtop FDM 3D Printer
Resolution,
Surface Roughness, and Overhang
Resolution
is an important issue with respect to the current generation of benchtop
3D printers if small (<100 μm) channels are desired. Most
published examples of 3D-printed microchannels report channel sizes
of a few hundred micrometers (e.g., 200–250 μm for DLP9,10,30). Figure 1 shows a 3D-printed object with channels
of varying size and shape. Open channels with dimensions below 200
μm (400 μm by design) were obtained, which was ascertained
by shining light through them. The difference between the actual and
designed channel widths is a result of the tolerances of the printer.
Positive structures (solid, protruding) are generally printed slightly
larger, whereas negative structures (recessed, open/embedded) are
slightly smaller. The surface and shape of these small channels are
not so smooth, due to the fact that these dimensions are in the same
range as the dimensions of a single thread of extruded material. Larger
channels assume a more well-defined shape.

Figure 1 Resolution of FDM 3D-printed
channels (rectangular, circular, and
diamond-shaped). The top panel shows the front view of the entire
test structure, presented in Figure S1, Supporting Information. The panels below depict enlarged views of the
individual channels, all scaled individually to the size of the frame.

In other work on FDM, a channel
with a diameter of 0.8 mm was successfully
used in 3D-printed reactionware.7 However,
the effect of limited resolution due to the filament dimension is
clearly visible in Figure 1 at this smaller scale. In larger channels, the microstructure
of the fused threads of filament is identical to that of smaller channels,
which means that these channels possess the same absolute surface
roughness. However, the overall effect of individual filaments on
the definition of the channel shape is much less pronounced, as can
also be seen in Figure 1. This is inherent to the FDM process and should be taken into account
when FDM is selected as a fabrication method. While it is clear that
FDM is not suitable for direct fabrication of smooth microfluidic
channels, it can be suitable for structures that are less dependent
on the exact channel shape or can be operated on the millimeter scale
(millifluidics).

Figure 1 also shows
the quality of overhanging structures. Due to the nature of FDM, bridging
structures are difficult to produce, as there are no layers supporting
them. One solution to this problem is to print support structures
(implemented into the G-code during slicing), which can be removed
afterward. However, such structures are impossible to remove inside
small channels. A second option is to use dual-head printing, in which
the channel can be filled with a water-soluble material (e.g., poly(vinyl
alcohol), PVA). The easiest solution (if applicable) is to use designs
which circumvent this issue altogether. The overhang tends to start
collapsing when its size exceeds a certain threshold. Below this threshold
(more or less 1 mm; see Figure 1), collapse is not a problem. If a circular or diamond-shaped
channel shape is chosen instead of a rectangular one, the overhang
is gradually formed. Figure 1 shows that the quality of the cross-sectional geometry of
large channels increases as we go from rectangle (in this case square)
to circle to diamond. However, for channels 1 mm or smaller, the fidelity
of the cross-sectional geometry is best for the rectangular shape.

Prevention of Leakage
Leakage is probably the most
undesirable phenomenon that a fluidic device can exhibit. Figure 2 demonstrates a number
of channels (0.8 mm width × 0.8 mm height) of the exact same
geometry, yet sliced with different settings, that are filled with
a methanol/water (1:1, v/v) solution containing blue dye. The value
of the infill solidity parameter determines the ratio
between the filament and air in the interior of the part; a value
of 0.2 yields a very open infill, whereas 1.0 leads to a complete
fill of the internal volume. The shell number refers
to the number of adjacent filament threads that outline the contours
of all structures.

Figure 2 Influence of the infill solidity and shell number on leakage
prevention
in a 3D-printed channel. The estimated print time (after slicing)
is shown for each setting as well. Detailed schematic diagrams are
given in Figure S2, Supporting Information.

This figure shows that a more
solid infill is preferential for
fluidic devices. However, this means a larger consumption of material,
as well as increased printing times, as can be seen from the estimated
print times, calculated by the software after slicing. Another way
to prevent leakage is to increase the shell number. Even with a very
open infill (0.2), a shell number of 4 led to a channel exhibiting
no leakage into the rest of the part. These settings also result in
shorter print jobs compared to high-infill settings.

Transparency
Many microfluidic devices rely on visual
(microscopic) inspection for control of their operation. For this
reason, materials such as PDMS, glass, and transparent thermoplastics
are very popular in the field. Transparency is claimed for a number
of FDM materials. As of yet, to the best of our knowledge, 60% transmission
(430–620 nm light) through a 500 μm thick polymer layer
is the highest level of transparency achieved, but this was done with
photocurable resin and DLP.9 In FDM, not
only the transmission of the material itself, but also the microstructure
of the produced parts is relevant. Due to the stacking of layers of
threads, light is scattered as it passes through a polymer device.
When using one of these “transparent” materials, see-through
devices can be made, as long as the thickness of the part is kept
at a minimum (roughly up to 1 mm). To cope with this, glass slides
can be integrated into 3D-printed devices. One possible approach is
to fabricate a channel with the 3D printer which is open at the bottom
and then attach it with glue or a photocurable resin to the glass
slide.25,27 In this work, we produced a test device
with sealed channels that were 3D-printed on top of an embedded glass
slide. This glass slide was inserted during the print, after the printer
was paused. This is an attractive feature of FDM 3D printing that
is not found in SL or DLP approaches. Figure 3 shows the device from the top (Figure 3A, poly(lactic acid),
PLA, side) and from the bottom (Figure 3B, glass slide). The channel was then filled with an
aqueous solution of blue dye. The thickness of the PLA ceiling over
the channel is 0.8 mm. Although the liquid can be observed when the
channel is viewed from above (Figure 3C), it is clear that true transparency is not achieved.
However, when viewed through the glass slide at the bottom of the
channel, we obtained an unobscured view. The obtained channels can
confine aqueous solutions and are compatible with microscopy on the
glass-slide side. More research is required, however, to quantify
and improve the strength of PLA adhesion to the glass, which is weaker
than attachment to PLA. When PLA is printed on top of PLA, the layers
melt together, which does not happen when printed on glass. Noteworthy
is that FDM provides for the incorporation of other materials or components
besides glass, such as paper, membranes, and electrodes.

Figure 3 (A, B) PLA–glass
device with sealed fluidic channels, suitable
for microscopic inspection (see the Supporting Information, Figure S3, for the dimensions). The glass slide
is incorporated into a single 3D-printed PLA part. The glass is inserted
during the print by pausing the print. (C) Transparent PLA was used,
which gives semitransparency through a limited thickness. The thickness
of the top PLA layer through which the blue solution is being visualized
is 0.8 mm, which is clearly too thick for a clear image of the microchannel
(1 mm wide and high). (D) The blue solution in the same printed channel
can be clearly imaged under the microscope when viewed through the
glass bottom. There appears to be a bit of leakage along the edges
of the PLA channel where it contacts the glass slide.

The above-mentioned solution enables transparency
in channels with
one planar wall (which is the glass slide in this case), but this
approach cannot be applied to channels making up 3D networks in a
device. However, such channels should only be used when there is a
functional demand, since they are more difficult to produce. If such
a channel is included in a device for a functional reason, and visual
inspection is also needed, a channel with a planar wall (such as a
glass slide) can be implemented into the design after this functional
element and can be used for visual inspection of the parameter of
interest. Alternatively, FDM printing could be used for indirect fabrication
of channels that travel through all planes by employing sacrificial
templates31 (described in the section “3D-Printed Masters for PDMS Casting”)
in a transparent material.

Combining Materials
In addition
to the integration
of non-3D-printed objects into a part, FDM also allows the fabrication
of hybrid devices. Highly complex structures can be obtained by using
dual-head printing, in which two materials can be printed more or
less simultaneously, thus allowing embedding of one material in the
other. A simpler approach is to pause the print at a certain point
and exchange the filament. One such example can be found in the combination
of PLA with Arnitel in a two-layer part for masking paper during exposure
to oxygen plasma.17 When pressure is applied
to the rigid PLA side, the flexible Arnitel side conforms to whatever
surface it is in contact with, in this case paper. Using this approach,
it was possible to shield paper from exposure to oxygen plasma, as
demonstrated in previous work.17

Warping
During a print, especially for large, time-consuming
parts, the internal temperature of the printed object tends to vary.
Materials are printed at high temperature (around 200 °C, the
temperature of the extrusion nozzle) onto the print bed (around 60
°C) and cooled with an integrated fan for quick solidification.
This usually causes shrinkage and can lead to deformation through
warping. Warping can lead to detachment from the print bed and thus
compromises part fabrication. Warping can easily become a problem
if the temperature of the print bed is too low or if the print bed
is not well aligned or is too far from the extruder. Under all these
circumstances, initial attachment to the print bed is insufficient.
Materials that require higher temperatures for extrusion and bed adhesion
are especially prone to warping and detachment (e.g., acrylonitrile
butadiene styrene, ABS). There are a number of options to reduce or
prevent part detachment due to warping: (i) place the printer in a
closed box (preventing convective air movement) that can be heated
to maintain a more uniform temperature distribution, (ii) coat the
print bed with a material that enhances adhesion (e.g., ABS dissolved
in acetone or hairspray), (iii) print the first few layers of the
part in a material that has good adhesion to the plate (e.g., PLA
soft) and then switch to the actual material for the print, and (iv)
have the slicing software include a brim in the G-code for the part,
which can be removed after the print is done. Incorporating a brim
means that a number of additional shells are printed on the first
layer to increase the surface attached to the plate.

Polymers
for FDM 3D Printing
The results for the different
characterizations performed on 12 FDM materials can be found in Table 1. We refer the reader
to Table S2 in the Supporting Information for a list of the printing parameters for these materials. The following
sections deal with the different aspects of the materials that need
to be taken into account when a material is selected for an application.
Note that suppliers of filament (i) generally do not list the exact
chemical composition of their filament and (ii) are continuously improving
their products, as we are currently going through a phase of rapid
development in the 3D printing field.

a The classification of biocompatibility,
solvent compatibility, and autofluorescence is based on the rules
for performance described in the Supporting Information (protocol S5, solvent compatibility; protocol S6, biocompatibility;
Figure S6, autofluorescence).

Polymer
Printability
This section describes the problems
that might be encountered when the different polymers are printed
individually. The success or failure of the print process for a part
largely depends on whether the first layer is printed properly. As
alluded to in the previous section, warping and/or detachment from
the print bed is an important cause for failure. The print bed used
in this work can reach a maximum temperature of approximately 80 °C.
This means that materials such as ABS, polystyrene (PS), and especially
polycarbonate (PC) are difficult to print, as they require higher
temperatures for bed adhesion and are thus more prone to warping.
For small parts, this can be overcome by printing with a brim, as
discussed above. Coating of the print bed with adhesive material also
improves attachment, but was not an option for this study, as it would
lead to contamination of the test structures. For the production of
PC parts, another temperature-related problem can be encountered,
associated with the actual softening of printer components (e.g.,
poly(ether ether ketone), PEEK, insulation) after prolonged usage
at temperatures around 250 °C. This can lead to irreparable damage
of the printer component.

Autofluorescence
The autofluorescence
of a material
refers to its own tendency to emit fluorescence upon illumination
with light at certain wavelengths. Autofluorescence can be a limitation
when the material is used in tests that rely on fluorescence, especially
for quantitative analysis. Table 1 shows to what extent the 12 materials that were tested
exhibit autofluorescence at different wavelengths. We defined categories
with selected thresholds and classified the materials accordingly.
The photographs and numerical data can be found in Figures S5 and
S6 of the Supporting Information, respectively.
All the materials tested exhibit autofluorescence to some degree,
but with some the level is quite acceptable. PLA 45 can be employed
when green and red fluorescence are used, whereas PLA soft is applicable
to blue and red. In general, the FDM materials tested exhibited less
autofluorescence at red wavelengths. The application of fluorescence
detection at longer visible (red) wavelengths in a 3D-printed device
thus allows for a broader selection of FDM materials. Importantly,
some of the tested materials contain (colored) additives, which might
influence the level of autofluorescence.

Solvent Compatibility
Table 1 gives an
overview of the compatibility of
the 12 materials with 5 different solvents. 3D-printed test structures
were exposed to the different solvents. The differences after 1 week
(168 h) in weight of the structure before and after exposure and the
amount of dissolved material in the solvent were determined by weighing
the contents of the testing tubes. The materials were then classified
into different categories on the basis of these numerical data and
photographs after exposure (respectively Figures S7 and S8, Supporting Information). These results demonstrate
that all the materials except PVA are compatible with water. 2-Propanol
and methanol are both compatible with most materials, but acetonitrile
and acetone are more challenging. Arnitel is the only material from
this selection which can be employed for all five solvents. Furthermore,
it is remarkable that the flexible materials (PLA soft and Bendlay)
show better solvent compatibility than the rigid filament on which
they are based (PLA and ABS, respectively), which we assume is caused
at least in part by additives meant to increase flexibility. Finally,
it should be noted that in a few cases the sum of the dissolved weight
and remaining weight exceed 100% of the initial weight (see Figure S7). This can potentially be attributed
to swelling phenomena and/or encapsulation of solvent in the polymer
matrix.

Biocompatibility
Table 1 shows the results of the biocompatibility
studies.
Out of the 12 FDM materials tested, 11 show biocompatibility with
HUVECs and PCLSs (Figures S9–S13, Supporting Information); only PVA shows significant toxicity for both
biological models in comparison with the controls (p = 0.009 for MTT test in HUVECs, p = 2 × 10–7 for LDH leakage in PCLSs, p = 0.002
for ATP measurement in PCLSs). Although PVA is described as a biocompatible
material and is used in medical studies,32 it was toxic in experiments performed with both HUVECs and PCLSs.
This may be explained by the high solubility of PVA in the aqueous
medium. This leads to an observed increase in the medium viscosity
(the medium becomes gel-like), which may result in decreased diffusion
of nutrients and oxygen to the cells and hence decreased viability.
Furthermore, contaminants or additives might be present in the filament.
After dissolution, these might have a toxic effect on the biological
material. The fact that the solvent compatibility studies show no
dissolution of any of the other materials in water is also in line
with the observation that they do not cause a loss in viability in
cells or tissue.

A control experiment was carried out to assess
the possible influence of the materials on the fluorescence-based
LDH assay. It measured the absolute emission intensity in the absence
of PCLSs. The only material that caused a significant increase of
the intensity measured was PVA (p = 4 × 10–7). However, the average difference from the control
was 134 AU, which is less than 1% of the average fluorescence intensity
measured in the medium for PCLSs incubated with PVA for 24 h. The
effect of PVA itself on the LDH assay can therefore be regarded as
negligible.

The assays show similar results in cell and tissue
cultures. Futhermore,
the results are comparable to those found in earlier studies to assess
the biocompatibility of FDM materials18,25,33—though this study comprises a broader range
of materials. To the best of our knowledge, we observe only one deviation
from previous biocompatibility results, namely, for ABS. Hyde and
co-workers18 found that ABS exhibits some
toxicity toward human neuroblastoma cells and mouse pituitary cells.
It was also shown that ABS influenced the functionality of cortical
neurons. We, however, have not observed any negative effects of ABS
on the HUVEC or PCLS models. Furthermore, the toxicity of a material
might also be attributed to additives in the material, which can vary
from producer to producer. While our results can serve as a guideline
for selecting a safe material for in vitro cell or tissue studies,
researchers in other laboratories and working with other cells or
tissue will need to confirm the biocompatibility of their materials
for their biological models. Finally, with the possible applications
of implantable devices in mind, more extensive, clinical biocompatibility
studies are required to test the safety and stability of the materials
in vivo.

Applications of FDM 3D Printing
3D-Printed
Masters for PDMS Casting
The use of 3D printers
for the fabrication of masters which can be used for casting PDMS
(and other curable materials) has been demonstrated for inkjet printing
(down to 100 μm resolution15) and
DLP (down to 50 μm resolution13). Figure 4 shows two FDM-printed
masters and the resulting PDMS devices. The smallest channel produced
had a width of approximately 300 μm.

(F) PDMS replicate of the complex channel, filled with blue dye solution.

Figure 4 also demonstrates
that complex architectures are easily achievable (Figure 4E), but that the variation
in channel width in such devices is quite substantial. The nominal
width of the spirally laid out channel in Figure 4F, made using the master in Figure 4E, is 0.3 mm. However, the
width of the dye-filled channel varies roughly between 0.1 and 0.5
mm. Additionally, the base plane of the master suffers from roughness,
which is characteristic for FDM 3D printing as discussed earlier.
This is replicated in the PDMS cast, which can complicate bonding
of parts to a flat surface for sealing. This in turn increases the
likelihood of leakage. It is possible to use FDM-printed templates
for PDMS replication, but other 3D printing methods are perhaps more
suitable for this purpose, depending on the required resolution of
the part.

The production of sacrificial templates with 3D printing
for replication
of microfluidic devices (by dissolution of the polymer after curing)
has been reported31 and is a method that
can be adapted for FDM. One could print a 3D object in PVA, cast PDMS
around it, and later dissolve the PVA in water to remove it. This
approach could also circumvent the above-mentioned problem of leakages
in the PDMS device due to surface roughness of the master, as the
PDMS device could be replicated in a single step.

3D-Printed
Channels
Many reports have described the
use of 3D-printed channels, some of which employed FDM.7Figures 1–3 of this paper show simple
examples of embedded channels made with FDM as well. From an applications
point of view, FDM 3D printing is suitable for the production of fluidic
channels. However, if one is aiming to produce channels with cross
sections on the order of 100 μm or less, FDM is currently not
the way to go. This is because FDM resolution is limited by the nozzle
diameter and therefore by the dimensions of extruded filament threads.
3D-printed channel structures might be employed for cell or tissue
culture, though a glass slide needs to be incorporated to allow microscopic
examination of the cells. Most of the materials that are used in FDM
3D printing are also biocompatible, which makes this method an excellent
choice for development of devices for cell-based applications. Furthermore,
FDM-printed channels might be a good option for devices that do not
need micrometer dimensions for exact fluid control, such as for simple
chemical processes. This is especially true when there are financial
or technological restrictions.

Since 3D printing allows the
creation of objects of almost any shape, the fluidic entrance can
be designed to fit to tubing or other means of coupling to a pumping
system. It was demonstrated above that, by only applying hydrostatic
pressure, leakage could easily occur in devices with open infill,
but also that it could be solved by increasing the shell number or
infill solidity. Such aspects need to be taken into consideration
during both the design and slice processes.

Patterning in Paper Microfluidics
Hydrophilic channels
or lanes can be defined in paper using hydrophobic patterning techniques.
Passive fluid transport by capillary action then serves to move liquids
through the paper channels to carry out reactions or other sample
handling. Hydrophobic patterning may be accomplished in different
ways. 3D-printed parts may be used in the production of paper microfluidic
structures, as we have reported for the patterning of alkyl ketene
dimer-treated paper strips.17 One other
approach which has received some attention in our laboratory involves
the use of wax deposition,34 for which
we have developed a tool by FDM 3D printing, as shown in Figure 5. The 3D-printed
parts (Figure 5A,B)
successfully shielded parts of the paper from the deposition of molten
wax when the assembly in Figure 5B was dipped in it. This reproducibly led to clearly
defined hydrophilic (untreated paper, white) and hydrophobic (wax-treated,
gray) regions (Figure 5C,D). The paper channels defined between the wax barriers were characterized
with respect to their width (Figure 5D,E). Correlation was found between the width of the
thin PLA strip of the mask and the size of the resulting paper microfluidic
channel. 3D printing is very suitable for the realization of rapid
prototyping of different paper microfluidic structures. However, for
mass production of paper microfluidic devices, other production methods
are more time-efficient.

masks to shield the

Customizing Laboratory Equipment and 3D-Printed Tools
A last example of the applicability of (FDM) 3D printing for a research
laboratory involves the production of labware and lab tools or the
customization of an experimental setup, saving money and time and
allowing for robust and user-friendly experimental setups. Figure 6 shows a few such
applications in our laboratory.

Conclusion
In
November 2012, we bought a Felix v.1.5 printer for roughly 1.000
€. At that time we had no real expectations of this technology,
and it seemed like an interesting and relatively inexpensive experiment.
3D printing was a new concept in the field of lab-on-a-chip and (bio)analytical
technology, and few laboratories had experience with this technology.
Now, only about 4 years later, we have seen a rapid increase in the
number of publications in microfluidics and related fields utilizing
this technology. Furthermore, it is now difficult to imagine life
in our own laboratory without 3D printing.

3D printing is a
technique that belongs to everybody. The advent
of affordable printers has meant the rapid establishment of this technology
in many aspects of life besides research. The societal impact of the
technology has been growing, meaning that further leaps in the development
of this tool are likely in the near future. One big advantage of the
common appeal of the 3D printer is the fact that there is a large
interactive community revolving around this topic. This community
has proven to be valuable for the research described in this work,
as solutions for some of the described problems (as well as some ideas)
were developed after various Internet forums, such as the RepRap forums
and various forums linked to commercially available printers (e.g.,
Felix and Ultimaker), were consulted. Unfortunately, such information
is diffuse and almost impossible to trace to the original authors
or inventors, so their sources do not appear in the list of references
for this work.

In relation to other printing approaches, FDM
is probably the most
accessible. Both the materials and the printer itself are inexpensive.
Other advantages of the FDM method include the ease with which different
materials can be switched during a print and the possibility to integrate
and embed external components into a single part. Other benefits are
the biocompatibility of most FDM materials with tissue and cells and
the wide range of materials available for printing. Drawbacks are
mainly related to the resolution and surface smoothness (which is
slightly better with other 3D printing approaches, such as DLP). However,
given the rate of current developments, we expect that (FDM) printers
capable of achieving higher resolution will become available in the
foreseeable future.

It is our hope that this work, as well as
all the work cited, will
help to convince researchers in the field of microfluidics and lab-on-a-chip
that 3D printing indeed offers grand opportunities to do better, more
efficient science. This is certainly a technology that can make our
jobs as scientists easier and, moreover, stimulate our creativity.
