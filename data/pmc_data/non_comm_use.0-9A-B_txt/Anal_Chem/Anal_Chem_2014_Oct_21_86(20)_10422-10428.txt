This work describes the method of
a selective hydride generation-cryotrapping
(HG-CT) coupled to an extremely sensitive but simple in-house assembled
and designed atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS) instrument for
determination of toxicologically important As species. Here, an advanced
flame-in-gas-shield atomizer (FIGS) was interfaced to HG-CT and its
performance was compared to a standard miniature diffusion flame (MDF)
atomizer. A significant improvement both in sensitivity and baseline
noise was found that was reflected in improved (4 times) limits of
detection (LODs). The yielded LODs with the FIGS atomizer were 0.44,
0.74, 0.15, 0.17 and 0.67 ng L–1 for arsenite, total
inorganic, mono-, dimethylated As and trimethylarsine oxide, respectively.
Moreover, the sensitivities with FIGS and MDF were equal for all As
species, allowing for the possibility of single species standardization
with arsenate standard for accurate quantification of all other As
species. The accuracy of HG-CT-AFS with FIGS was verified by speciation
analysis in two samples of bottled drinking water and certified reference
materials, NRC CASS-5 (nearshore seawater) and SLRS-5 (river water)
that contain traces of methylated As species. As speciation was in
agreement with results previously reported and sums of all quantified
species corresponded with the certified total As. The feasibility
of HG-CT-AFS with FIGS was also demonstrated by the speciation analysis
in microsamples of exfoliated bladder epithelial cells isolated from
human urine. The results for the sums of trivalent and pentavalent
As species corresponded well with the reference results obtained by
HG-CT-ICPMS (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry).

==== Body
Trivalent
and pentavalent inorganic,
mono-, di- and trimethylated arsenicals, the products of animal and
human metabolism of arsenic, are analytes of toxicological significance:
arsenite (iAs(III)), arsenate (iAs(V)), methylarsonite (MAs(III)),
methylarsonate (MAs(V)), dimethylarsinite (DMAs(III)), dimethylarsinate
(DMAs(V)) and trimethylarsine oxide (TMAs(V)O). These species, free
or bound to proteins in biological systems,1 have various toxicities including mutagenic, teratogenic and carcinogenic
effects.2−4 Therefore, it is necessary to identify and quantify
them separately in biological systems to evaluate potential toxicological
risk. The most common approaches to As speciation analysis rely on
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in combination with
a sensitive specific element detector such as inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS)5 or postcolumn
hydride generation (HG) with atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS).6,7 However, both methods provide insufficient sensitivity for speciation
analysis of all toxicologically relevant species at low or only slightly
elevated As exposures. In addition, these methods are not suitable
for direct analysis of complex biological samples without previous
preparation steps, such as extraction, filtration or centrifugation,
which can result in losses of species or speciation change.

Selective generation of arsine and methylsubstituted arsines followed
by preconcentration and separation in a cryogenic trap (CT) is a convenient
approach for ultrasensitive speciation analysis of these arsenicals
because of its two inherent features: (i) effective preconcentration
and (ii) separation capability. Although this approach is limited
because only four arsines can be formed (i.e., AsH3, CH3AsH2, (CH3)2AsH and (CH3)3As), the selectivity can be enhanced by the selectivity
of HG itself. At pH 6, only trivalent species and TMAs(V)O are quantitatively
converted to their corresponding arsines while iAs(V) and MAs(V) are
not (<1%) and DMAs(V) only to a small extent (4–6%). After
prereduction with l-cysteine (l-cys), arsines are
quantitatively generated from both tri- and pentavalent species with
the exception of TMAs(V)O. This selective HG-CT based approach was
successfully coupled to atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS)8 with various applications in our laboratories.9−13 However, for toxicological studies generating small amounts of biological
material (e.g., limited numbers of cells collected in population or
laboratory studies) only the most sensitive ICPMS detector yields
satisfactory sensitivity.14 For example,
determination of As species in small samples of human cells and mouse
pancreatic islets by HG-CT-ICPMS has been successfully used in studies
examining risk and mechanism of diabetes associated with chronic exposure
to iAs.15,16 However, the high investment and running
costs associated with ICPMS use may not be the only solution.

AFS instruments (coupled to HG) can provide analytical performance
comparable to that of ICPMS at substantially lower costs6 and can be assembled in the laboratory from commercially
available parts.17 Commercially available
AFS instruments consist of a boosted-output hollow cathode lamp as
the radiation source and a miniature diffusion flame (MDF) as the
atomizer.6,17−19 For in-house assembled
instruments, the use of commercially available electrodeless discharge
lamps (EDLs) was determined to be a much better solution20 owing to higher radiation intensity and the
resulting lower limits of detections (LODs).21 When MDF is replaced by a flame-in-gas-shield atomizer (FIGS), a
highly fuel rich hydrogen oxygen micro flame burning in an argon shield,
the sensitivity and baseline noise can be further improved.17,22−24

The HG-CT-AFS combination has been scarcely
mentioned in the As
speciation analysis literature.25−27 This work aims to demonstrate
the potential of the selective generation of arsine and methylsubstituted
arsines combined with cryotrapping and AFS detection and to assess
advantages of the FIGS over the MDF atomizer. The feasibility of the
selective generation of arsines combined with cryotrapping and AFS
detection using a FIGS atomizer is illustrated by speciation analysis
in certified water reference materials, an example of samples with
extremely low As concentrations, and in human bladder exfoliated cells
(BECs), an example of limited-size tissue samples typically collected
in population or clinical studies.

Experimental Section
If not explicitly stated otherwise, the experiments described were
performed at the Institute of Analytical Chemistry (IAC) in Prague.

Atomic
Fluorescence Spectrometry
The in-house assembled
nondispersive atomic fluorescence spectrometer of similar concept
as described by D’Ulivo was used.20 It is equipped with a commercially available As EDL (System II)
as the radiation source, similar to that described in ref (28), an interference filter
to isolate fluorescence radiation from the atomizer described below
and a solar blind photomultiplier as the detector. The feeding power
for the EDL was square-wave modulated at 40 Hz. This modulation enabled
signal measurement in two modes alternately during the EDL cycle:
(i) the lamp turned on (fluorescence signal and emission of the flame
were recorded) and (ii) the lamp turned off (only emission of the
flame was recorded). By subtracting the values obtained in these two
modes, the fluorescence signals were corrected to the emission of
the flame. See the Supporting Information for a detailed description of the spectrometer.

Standards and
Reagents
Deionized water (DIW; <0.2
μS cm–1, Ultrapur, Watrex, USA) was used for
the preparation of all solutions. A 1000 mg L–1 As
standard solution (Merck, Germany) was used as the iAs(V) stock standard
solution. Stock solutions of 1000 mg L–1 As were
prepared for MAs(V), DMAs(V) and TMAs(V)O species in DIW using the
following compounds: Na2CH3AsO3·6H2O (Chem Service, USA), (CH3)2As(O)OH
(Strem Chemicals, Inc., USA); (CH3)3AsO was
obtained courtesy of Dr. William Cullen (University of British Columbia,
Canada). The total As content of methylated As species standards was
confirmed by liquid sampling graphite furnace-AAS (GF-AAS) in 100
μg L–1 solutions of individual species using
a PerkinElmer Analyst 800 instrument. End-capped transversely heated
tubes modified permanently by 4 μg of Ir were used at the program
and conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Assuming that the
sensitivity for individual As forms were identical in the GF-AAS,
the values obtained were taken as the true content.8

Working standards were prepared for individual As
species by serial dilution of stock solutions in DIW. Mixed standards
were used only after the last dilution, i.e., at the sub μg
L–1 level. When the sums of trivalent and pentavalent
forms were analyzed (with the exception of TMAs(V)O), prereduction
by l-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate (l-cys;
Merck, Germany) added into the standard solution to final concentration
of 2% (m/v) was carried out at least 1 h prior to the analysis. A
reducing solution containing 1% (m/v) NaBH4 (Fluka, Germany)
in 0.1% (m/v) KOH (Lach-Ner, s.r.o., Czech Republic) was prepared
fresh daily. A 0.75 M Tris–HCl buffer was prepared from the
reagent grade Trizma hydrochloride (Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane
hydrochloride; Sigma, Germany) and adjusted to pH 6 by the addition
of approximately 1.5 mL of 10% (m/v) KOH per 250 mL of the buffer
solution.

Hydride Generator with a Cryotrap
The hydride generator
described previously14 was used with minor
modifications (Figure 1). Briefly, reductant,
Tris–HCl buffer and DIW were pumped by a peristaltic pump (PP1,
Reglo Digital, Ismatec, Switzerland) at flow rates of 1 mL min–1. Samples were injected into the flow of DIW by a
manual six-port injection valve (Rheodyne, USA) with a 0.6 mL sample
loop volume unless stated otherwise. The dryer, incorporated between
the gas–liquid separator (GLS) and the CT, was filled with
solid sodium hydroxide pellets (p.a., Lachner, Czech Republic, pearls
of 3 mm o.d.). The CT device consisting of a 300 mm glass U-tube (2.4
mm i.d.) packed with Chromosorb WAW-DMCS 45/60, 15% OV-3 (Supelco,
USA) was previously described.14 The U-tube
was wrapped with a resistance wire with a current for heating of 1.6
A (∼23.5 V). The flow rate of carrier He was 90 mL min–1.

PP2, peristaltic
pumps.

Procedure
Approximately
3/4 of the U-tube was manually
immersed in liquid N2 before the beginning of the cycle.
The cycle started with switching on PP1, and after 5 s, the sample
was injected into a flow of DIW. The PP1 was switched off after 90
s. Another 90 s was allowed to complete the reaction and for transport
of arsines from the GLS to the CT. Subsequently, the volatilization
step started by removing the flask with liquid N2 and switching
on heating of the U-tube. To improve the resolution between (CH3)2AsH and (CH3)3As peaks,
the heating was manually switched off at the time corresponding to
CH3AsH2 signal maximum and switched on again
after 20 s to remove incidental byproducts from the CT. The signal
was recorded during the entire volatilization step (70–80 s
read time). Subsequently, PP2 was switched on to remove the waste
liquid from the GLS and the heating was switched off. The total cycle
time was less than 6 min.

Atomizers
Unless stated otherwise,
the FIGS atomizer
displayed in Figure 2 was used. This atomizer
consisted of a vertical tube (support tube) made of quartz (6 mm i.d.,
8.5 mm o.d.) that introduced gases from the HG-CT system, i.e., He,
Ar and H2 carrying arsines. The support tube was surrounded
by a two-channel brass shielding unit that formed two outer concentric
shielding Ar flows around the atomizer. The dimensions of the shielding
unit were as follows: inner shielding unit, 14.9 mm i.d. and 16.0
mm o.d.; outer shielding unit, 20.8 mm i.d. and 22.4 mm o.d.29 An inner quartz capillary (0.53 mm i.d.) centered
in the support tube with its tip 5 mm above the support tube top introduced
O2 forming a tiny, nearly invisible, flame at the capillary
tip. The optical axis of the spectrometer, i.e., the axis of the radiation
beam, intersected the (vertical) axis of the support tube at a height
of 7 mm above the capillary tip. For comparative purposes, the atomizer
also served as a miniature diffusion flame (MDF) when O2 and Ar shielding flows were stopped, the capillary tip was aligned
with the support tube top and the radiation beam axis was at a height
of 7 mm above the capillary tip/support tube top which was optimal
for both atomizers. All gas flow rates, controlled by mass flow controllers
(FMA 2400 Series, Omega Engineering, Inc., USA) or by rotameters with
needle valves, are summarized in Table 1.

Sample Preparation
Water
Samples and CRMs
The developed method was verified
by analyzing two certified reference materials and two samples of
bottled drinking water purchased from a local store in Prague. The
reference materials SLRS-5 (river water) and CASS-5 (nearshore seawater)
were obtained from the Institute for National Measurement Standards
(National Research Council, Canada). The samples were measured directly
for iAs(III) and TMAs(V)O determination, whereas for iAs(III+V), MAs(V)
and DMAs(V) determination, 2% (m/v) solid l-cys was added
at least 1 h prior to analysis. Quantification of As species was performed
against external calibration of aqueous mixed standards treated with
2% l-cys.

Bladder Exfoliated Cells (BECs)
Thirty midstream urine
samples (∼100 mL) were collected for this study from residents
of Chihuahua, Mexico who are exposed to iAs in drinking water. The
collection and preparation of the BEC samples is described in detail
elsewhere14,15 and is summarized in the Supporting Information. The lysed BEC samples were first analyzed
at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) for trivalent
species and subsequently for the sum of tri- and pentavalent species
by HG-CT-ICPMS. The remaining aliquots were shipped on dry ice to
IAC in Prague where the sums of tri- and pentavalent species were
measured by HG-CT-AFS. Six BEC lysates were also quantified for trivalent
species to examine the stability of MAs(III) and DMAs(III). Diluted
sample aliquots were introduced to the HG-CT system using a 1 mL plastic
pipette tip connected directly to the peristaltic pump tubing of the
hydride generator, followed by a 350 μL DIW rinse (the injection
valve was disconnected in this case). Quantification of As species
in both laboratories was performed against external calibration of
aqueous mixed standards treated with 2% l-cys. Reported amounts
of As species are normalized per 10 000 cells.

Reference Methods
A HG-CT-AAS system with a multiatomizer30,31 was used at IAC as a reference method. The manual HG-CT system was
identical to that coupled with AFS. An AAnalyst 800 AAS spectrometer
(PerkinElmer, USA) equipped with FIAS 400 flow injection accessory
was employed. The multiatomizer was heated to 900 °C. The details
of this method are described in ref (8). Standard addition technique liquid sampling
ICPMS (Agilent 7700x) was used for determination of total As concentration
in the samples of bottled drinking water. The conditions are given
in the Supporting Information, Table S-1.
A reference analysis of BEC samples was carried out by HG-CT-ICPMS
using an Agilent 7500cx system as described elsewhere.14

Results and discussion
Interfacing the HG-CT System
to AFS Atomizers
The basic
parameters of selective HG-CT were optimized in our previous studies
when connected to AAS8,32 or ICPMS.14 The crucial component of the HG-CT-AFS system is a dryer
situated between the GLS and the CT that removes water vapor and aerosol
from the gaseous phase. There are at least two reasons to employ the
dryer: (i) the CT could be blocked by frozen water vapor and (ii)
water vapor released from the CT in the volatilization step can be
responsible for fluorescence signal fluctuations because water molecules
absorb radiation at a wavelength of 193.7 nm.33 Commercial AFS spectrometers employ a tube dryer with a Nafion membrane
for water removal.18 However, recent evidence
indicates that these dryers are unsuitable for use with the HG-CT
due to pronounced losses of methylated arsines.34 Instead of the Nafion tube, a dryer filled with NaOH pellets
had sufficient drying ability and was safe for all arsines at the
2 μg L–1 level.34 To exclude the presence of unfavorable sorption of arsines in the
NaOH dryer at 20 times lower concentration level, i.e., 100 ng L–1, the measured peak areas corresponding to individual
arsines were compared with those measured without the NaOH dryer.
Thus, the GLS outlet was connected directly to the U-tube. Absolutely
no losses of arsines in the dryer were observed because the relative
responses (with dryer/without dryer) for iAs(V), MAs(V), DMAs(V) and
TMAs(V)O were 101.5 ± 2.9%, 100.4 ± 3.0%, 97.9 ± 3.5%
and 103.5 ± 3.6%, respectively. The use of the NaOH dryer in
the HG-CT-AFS is critical because it results in improved performance
without the danger of accidental U-tube blocking by ice and in better
baseline stability. The NaOH dryer also significantly improved the
shape of AsH3 peak that was deformed at its trailing edge
without the dryer.

The baseline separation of all arsines that
are quickly released from the CT, typically within 50 s, is also crucial.
The early problem with unsatisfactory original resolution between
(CH3)2AsH and (CH3)3As
peaks was solved when the U-tube heating was manually switched off
at the time corresponding to CH3AsH2 peak maximum
(approximately in 42 s), delaying the release of (CH3)3As from the CT. The typical signals obtained from iAs(V),
MAs(V) and DMAs(V) measured with l-cys prereduction and of
TMAs(V)O measured without prereduction for optimized HG-CT conditions
are shown in Figure 3. The full width at half-maximum
(fwhm) and peak asymmetry factor (As; As is equal to b/a where a is the width of the front half of the peak
and b is the width of the back half of the peak measured
at 10% of the peak height from the leading or trailing edge of the
peak to a line dropped perpendicularly from the peak maximum) were
compared with those obtained by HG-CT-AAS with the multiatomizer.
The same HG-CT system, measurement procedure and total gas flow rate
through the U-tube (He + H2) were employed. The comparison
was done only for iAs(V) and MAs(V) because their release from the
U-tube was not influenced by the pause in heating. The fwhm for AAS
detector was 3.53 ± 0.11 s and 1.5 ± 0.02 s, respectively,
whereas for the AFS detector, it was slightly improved to 3.10 ±
0.15 s and 1.21 ± 0.05 s, respectively. However, the improvement
in peak asymmetry when replacing AAS with the AFS detector was substantial:
from As values of 1.79 ± 0.11 and
2.14 ± 0.14 to 1.16 ± 0.05 and 1.24 ± 0.05 for iAs(V)
and MAs(V), respectively. This is because analyte free atoms remain
for a brief period of time in the observation volume of the FIGS atomizer.
The free atoms are quickly flushed by high carrier gas flow as opposed
to the multiatomizer where the “physical” removal of
free atoms from the inner volume of the atomizer is apparently responsible
for the observed peak tailing. It should be highlighted that for the
AFS detector, peak shapes of all signals observed with the MDF atomizer
did not significantly differ from those with the FIGS atomizer.

measured at optimized conditions for 100
ng L–1 of iAs(V), MAs(V) and DMAs(V) with l-cys prereduction (red solid line) and for 80 ng L–1 of TMAs(V)O without prereduction (blue dashed line). 1, AsH3; 2, CH3AsH2; 3, (CH3)2AsH; 4, (CH3)3As. PMT voltage 1300 V.

In summary, the AFS peaks, regardless
of the atomizer, were narrower
and more symmetric (without significant tailing) than with multiatomizer/AAS
detection. Consequently, the separation of all arsines was more easily
achieved.

Analytical Performance
To demonstrate the exceptional
analytical performance of HG-CT-AFS using FIGS and its advantages
over MDF atomizers, the following critical parameters were investigated:
(i) sensitivity, (ii) repeatability and (iii) limit of detection (LOD).

(i) Sensitivity
The sensitivities (slopes
of calibration curve evaluated from peak areas) obtained with the
FIGS atomizer are listed in Table 2. Calibration
curves were linear in the tested concentration range up to 1500 ng
L–1. 100% hydride generation efficiency and the
same sensitivities for both trivalent and pentavalent hydride forming
As species were achieved in our recent works employing the same experimental
parameters for HG-CT when detection was performed by AAS with the
multiatomizer8,11,32 or by ICPMS.14 The slopes obtained by
HG-CT-AFS with FIGS also exhibited good uniformity for iAs(V), MAs(V)
and DMAs(V) after l-cys prereduction and for TMAs(V)O measured
without prereduction because all the relative sensitivities were between
97.6 and 105.4% (Table 2).

f With l-cys prereduction.

With the MDF atomizer, iAs(V) sensitivity
was 3.16 ± 0.06
times lower. This can be attributed to (i) much higher temperature
and thus thermal expansion in the observation volume of the MDF atomizer
and (ii) to chemical reactions of analyte free atoms with ambient
O2 that penetrates into the flame of the MDF atomizer more
easily than to the observation volume of the FIGS atomizer.23 Nevertheless, analogously as in the case of
the FIGS atomizer comparable relative sensitivities (relative to iAs(V)
= 100%) were also achieved: 96.2 ± 1.6% and 105.6 ± 1.6%
for MAs(V) and DMAs(V), respectively.

(ii) Repeatability
The repeatability
of the method was determined as RSD for nine measurements of individual
As species at 100 ng L–1. The repeatability of peak
areas with the FIGS atomizer was 2.1, 2.0, 2.7 and 2.0% for iAs(V),
MAs(V), DMAs(V) and TMAs(V)O, respectively. The repeatability measured
with the MDF atomizer was similar, 1.6, 1.8 and 2.6% for iAs(V), MAs(V)
and DMAs(V), respectively.

(iii) LOD
For LOD
evaluation, the baseline
noise was evaluated as SD of peak areas. The instrument baseline level
and baseline noise were observed when no gases were introduced to
an atomizer. When the FIGS atomizer was switched on, no significant
contribution either to baseline level (no FIGS emission) or to noise
was observed. Consequently, the signal correction to the flame emission
(see atomic fluorescence spectrometer description) was not used. In
contrast, the MDF atomizer was characterized by significant short
time fluctuations of its flame emission, increasing approximately
6 times the baseline noise. Therefore, using the correction of the
flame emission was essential for measurements with the MDF atomizer.
However, even with correction, the MDF baseline noise was 2 times
worse compared with FIGS. Therefore, only the FIGS atomizer was used
for further detailed LOD characterization.

Due to the extraordinary
sensitivity the LODs (3σ, n = 13) obtained
for the whole measurement procedure with HG-CT with the FIGS atomizer
for iAs(III), iAs(III+V) and TMAs(V)O were controlled by blank contamination.
The blank signals for iAs(III+V) and TMAs(V)O typically corresponded
to concentrations of 7.1 and 2.3 ng L–1, respectively.
The amount of iAs(III) was approximately one half of the sum for iAs(III+V),
3.6 ng L–1 (see Figure 4 for
a comparison of the blank signals with and without l-cys
prereduction). Contamination from reagents was the main source of
elevated blank signals because attempts to clean the whole generator
with concentrated HNO3 or HCl to eliminate memory effects
did not reduce the blank values. Blank signals for MAs(III+V) and
DMAs(III+V) were low (see Figure 4), around
the LOD levels. The improvement factors of the LOD in comparison to
the MDF atomizer were thus calculated only for these species because
these LODs were not controlled by contamination but rather by baseline
noise. The improvement factors for MAs(III+V) and DMAs(III+V) were
4.1 and 4.3, respectively, which is not far from the theoretical value
of six predicted from the improvement in sensitivities (3 times) and
from the reduction of baseline noise (2 times). As presented in Table 2, the LODs obtained with the FIGS atomizer are extremely
low and were improved by 2 orders of magnitude in comparison with
our previous HG-CT system with AAS detection.13 These LODs can even compete with those obtained with the HG-CT-ICPMS
system in our laboratory recently.14 Moreover,
the absolute LODs (in pg) are at least 1 order of magnitude better
than those achieved with other HG-CT-AFS based systems.25−27 The LODs for trivalent methylated species, MAs(III) and DMAs(III),
were also assessed. The determination is based on the observation
that the generation efficiency of CH3AsH2 and
(CH3)2AsH from Tris–HCl medium (without l-cys prereduction) is 100%, and therefore, the sensitivities
of MAs(III+V) and DMAs(III+V) for their determination can be safely
utilized.8 The obtained LODs were at the
same level as for the sums of pentavalent species.

Analysis of Water Samples and CRMs
The accuracy of
the developed HG-CT-AFS method was verified by speciation analysis
of two certified reference materials, SLRS-5 (river water) and CASS-5
(nearshore seawater), with total certified As concentrations of 0.413
± 0.039 and 1.24 ± 0.090 μg L–1,
respectively. The results are summarized in Table 3. Although these CRMs are certified only for total As content,
the speciation agreed well with the previously reported values measured
by several methods.14 As presented in Table 3, iAs(V) was the prevalent species in both CRMs,
but the pentavalent methylated species can also be conveniently quantified
by our method. Trivalent methylated species were not detected/quantified
at all and iAs(III) only to a small extent, reaching to approximately
1% of the iAs(III+V) concentration. Two samples of bottled drinking
water were also analyzed (Table 3). The sums
of As species were in agreement with the values obtained by liquid
sampling ICPMS. Concentrations of As species were also measured with
the reference HG-CT-AAS method; however, because of the limited detection
capability, only the sums of iAs(III+V) were quantified. The determined
values of 387 ± 28 and 254 ± 32 ng L–1 for water 1 and 2, respectively, corresponded well to the HG-CT-AFS
results in Table 3.

HG-CT-AFS Analysis of BECs Samples and Comparison
with HG-CT-ICPMS
The excellent analytical performance of
the HG-CT-AFS with the
FIGS atomizer and the extremely low LODs for all As species allows
for convenient analysis in microsamples of biological material. Here,
BEC samples collected from Chihuahua residents with high chronic exposure
to iAs from drinking water15 were analyzed
at IAC by the newly developed HG-CT-AFS method, and the results were
compared with results of the speciation analysis by HG-CT-ICPMS at
UNC. Only the sums of tri- and pentavalent species after l-cys prereduction are presented in Figure 5 and Table S-2 (Supporting Information). TMAsVO was not determined in those samples because
its contents were very low. When the whole dataset of 30 measured
BEC samples is considered, the concentrations of iAs(III+V), MAs(III+V)
and DMAs(III+V) determined by HG-CT-AFS versus HG-CT-ICPMS (Figure 5) exhibited good linearity with the slopes close
to 1 (1.016 ± 0.025 with R = 0.9861; 1.02 ±
0.04 with R = 0.9721; 1.044 ± 0.006 with R = 0.9995). Such an agreement between both laboratories
indicates good stability of As species methylation even after long
storage and transport. For six BEC samples, the oxidation state of
trivalent species was also determined when they were analyzed without l-cys treatment. The DMAs(III) signals were corrected for the
limited selectivity of HG at pH 6 by spiking experiments when DMAs(V)
was found to generate with 5.0–6.8% efficiency without l-cys prereduction. Conversely, the contribution of MAs(V) to
MAs(III) was negligible (<1%). The percentages of As species found
at IAC in the trivalent form in comparison to the values found at
UNC varied from 45–100% for iAs(III), 39%–100% for MAs(III),
and 0%–52% for DMAs(III), with medians of 91%, 82% and 19%,
respectively. Currier et al.9 observed
that MAs(III) and DMAs(III) species in cell lysates were stable for
at least 3 weeks when these samples were stored at −80 °C.
Our results indicate that these species in the lysed cells were not
completely preserved after storing for several months and shipping
overseas on dry ice. Especially DMAs(III), which was nearly completely
oxidized. Oxidation during thawing of the BEC samples and during their
preparation before analysis can also play a role.

Conclusion
The
selective generation of arsines combined with cryotrapping
and AFS detection using a FIGS atomizer is an extremely sensitive
approach, as demonstrated by the determination of the toxicologically
important As species in water samples and in human cells. Even though
the required instrumentation is relatively simple and inexpensive,
the yielded LODs outperform the much more frequently used HPLC-ICPMS
by several orders of magnitude and are comparable with HG-CT-ICPMS.
The advantage of the FIGS atomizer compared with a MDF atomizer lies
in improvement of LODs (4 times). The equal sensitivities for all
As species observed with both the FIGS or with the MDF atomizers suggest
equal generation and atomization efficiencies for all arsines. This
suggests that the HG setup and both atomizers perform well, which
has never been reported with AFS instruments due to either different
atomization efficiency of arsines35 and/or
different generation efficiency from HCl medium.36−38 Our results
confirm that single species standardization by using iAs(V) standards
can result in accurate quantification of all iAs and methylated As
species. This is important because the trivalent methylated As standards
are very unstable and are not readily available from commercial sources.39
