This paper focuses on one of the
most commonly encountered materials
in our society, namely paper. Paper is an inherently complex material,
yet its use provides for chemical analysis approaches that are elegant
in their simplicity of execution. In the first half of the previous
century, paper in scientific research was used mainly for filtration
and chromatographic separation. While its use decreased with the rise
of modern elution chromatography, paper remains a versatile substrate
for low-cost analytical tests. Recently, we have seen renewed interest
to work with paper in (bio)analytical science, a result of the growing
demand for inexpensive, portable analysis. Dried blood spotting, paper
microfluidics, and paper spray ionization are areas in which paper
is (re)establishing itself as an important material. These research
areas all exploit several properties of paper, including stable sample
storage, passive fluid movement and manipulation, chromatographic
separation/extraction, modifiable surface and/or volume, easily altered
shape, easy transport, and low cost. We propose that the real, and
to date underexploited, potential of paper lies in utilizing its combined
characteristics to add new dimensions to paper-based (bio)chemical
analysis, expanding its applicability. This article provides the reader
with a short historical perspective on the scientific use of paper
and the developments that led to the establishment of the aforementioned
research areas. We review important characteristics of paper and place
them in a scientific context in this descriptive, yet critical, assessment
of the achieved and the achievable in paper-based analysis. The ultimate
goal is the exploration of integrative approaches at the interface
between the different fields in which paper is or can be used.

==== Body
Paper is
a unique material.
One could say that the world as we know it may not have come to be,
if not for paper.1 It has for millennia
been the singlemost important information carrier, only now being
surpassed by the digital format. Most of our scientific knowledge
and cultural heritage has been preserved on paper. Before paper, we
had animal skin (parchment), stone, wood, papyrus, and even silk to
store and convey information, but these were variously bulky, heavy,
expensive, not ubiquitously available, or difficult to inscribe. Not
surprisingly, all of these materials became redundant after the introduction
of paper roughly two millennia ago.1 There
are several reasons underlying paper’s popularity for information
management: (1) paper is lightweight and thin and thus easily stored
and transported; (2) paper is cheap and easily produced and thus readily
available; (3) paper has a porous structure and is therefore an excellent
vessel for (long-term) storage of deposited material (such as ink).2−4

Another important application of paper is personal hygiene.
Tissues,
paper towels, and napkins are examples of items that are used on a
daily basis by billions of people globally. Try to imagine what your
day would be like without them. We can identify several reasons why
we use paper in this context. First of all, paper is easily disposed
of and recycled, as its main constituent is a biologically produced
(and biodegradable) material. Second, paper is flexible and deformable
and thus applicable to irregular surfaces. Third, the porosity and
hydrophilicity of paper result in capillary action,5,6 so
that paper can be used to absorb e.g. spilled liquids. Finally, paper
can be specifically fabricated for different purposes1,7 (thickness, consistency, smoothness/softness, deformability) and
modified to better suit the consumer’s needs (e.g., scented
or moist tissues).

The applications of paper are vast, but we
will conclude this introduction
with one everyday example, namely the preparation of coffee, as a
link to discussing the importance of paper in science. A common and
easy way to make coffee is with a paper filter. The pores in paper
can retain and thus separate solid particles from liquid, and as paper
is nontoxic for humans, it can be used in the preparation of products
for human consumption. Moreover, the paper filter nicely fits into
the coffee machine, serving as an example of how easily paper can
be shaped and combined with other materials to increase its utility.

In our consideration of the roles of paper in our everyday lives,
we can distill out relevant properties for its use in science. These
include availability, portability, affordability, biocompatibility,
modifiability (structurally, physically, and chemically), application
in sample/reagent storage, passive fluid propagation, filtration,
separation, and combination with other materials. In this article,
we will demonstrate that these properties can all contribute to the
use of paper in analytical science and that approaches exploiting
several properties simultaneously are the way to best leverage paper
for (bio)analysis.

Molecular, Micro, and Macro Structure of
Paper
The
word “paper” can refer to a range of materials. In ancient
Egypt, the papyrus plant was used to make sheets for writing, and
it is in fact this plant to which modern paper owes its name.1 However, papyrus is produced by laminating plant
fibers, whereas modern-day paper is produced from a fiber-containing
pulp (made from e.g. rags, straw, or wood), which undergoes a number
of (chemical) processes (e.g., removal of lignin, bleaching) before
it is pressed into sheets of paper and further processed.7,8 The different structural levels of paper in Figure 1 remind us of the properties of paper discussed
above and help define “paper”. With respect to its macroscopic
structure (Figure 1A), paper is a flexible sheet material, well below a millimeter in
thickness, while having almost any desired dimension in width and
length.

Figure 1 (A) Macroscopic, (B) microscopic, and (C) molecular structures
of paper.

When we look at paper through
the microscope (Figure 1B), we see an intricate network
of fibers of varying size and position. This network has a very open
nature. The microstructure thus defines another important characteristic
of paper, namely porosity, which is key to many of its applications.

The aforementioned fibers originate from plant material and are
produced in plant cells to form the protective cell wall. The fibers
consist of bundles of smaller fibers (microfibrils), which are made
from sheets of molecular cellulose, a polymer of d-glucose
(Figure 1C). Individual
polymer chains are hydrophilic and interact with each other through
hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl and ether groups (dashed lines
in Figure 1C). The
molecular structure reveals the last defining characteristic of paper,
namely, that it is made from cellulose or cellulose derivatives.9,10

History of Paper in Science
Paper has been used in
science for many years (Figure 2). One of the oldest examples, with scientific reports going
back to at least the early 19th century,11,12 involves the approximation of pH with litmus paper, a technique
that is still used today. We can recognize the properties of paper
that led to the conception of this product, namely disposability,
storage capacity for the reagent, and passive fluid movement.

Figure 2 A history of
paper in science, highlighting important milestones.

The next milestone was the invention of the coffee
filter by Melitta
Bentz. The filtration process is crucial in any chemistry laboratory
and exploits the disposability and deformability of paper, as well
as its porosity and the possibility for integration in a rigid container.

In the 1940s, Martin and Synge investigated partition chromatography13−15 on paper.14 Although earlier examples
of paper-chromatography-like approaches can be found in the literature,16 this work forms the basis of the method that
paved the way for modern chromatography. Paper chromatography relies
on passive fluid movement, differential retention, and the possibility
of loading the pores with e.g. aluminum or silica gel to improve separation.17

The first example of a paper microfluidic
structure was described
in 1937 by Yagoda,18 who employed hydrophobic
paraffin patterning to create hydrophilic “wells”. This
was followed by a paraffin-patterned paper microfluidic channel reported
by Müller et al. in 194919 for improving
paper chromatography. Skipping a few decades, paper microfluidics
regained attention in 2007, when the Whitesides group20 published their seminal paper on the subject, after a number
of critical publications on the need for cheap diagnostics in low-resource
settings.21,22 In this context, the aspects of affordability,
portability, and disposability are important. Alternative processes
for hydrophobic patterning are also being investigated for easier
fabrication of devices.23−25

In 1963, paper was employed
by Guthrie to test neonates for phenyl
ketonuria (PKU),26 an illness which can
lead to mental retardation if it goes unnoticed. A droplet of blood
taken from a heel prick was applied to a piece of paper and dried.
This dried blood spot (DBS) could be used for the diagnosis of the
disease. A few decades later, with the rise of mass spectrometry (MS),
the DBS technique has become increasingly popular due to the possibility
of combining paper with the high-resolution, high-sensitivity analytical
instrumentation.27,28 Various forms of paper are used
for DBS for reasons of storage capability, disposability, and easy
storage and transport.29 Now, DBS technology
enables diagnostics for people in developing countries, as well as
self-sampling patients who send their DBS to the laboratory by mail.

At the end of the 1980s, the lateral flow (immuno)assay (LFA),
or immunochromatography, was introduced,30 a format that became particularly popular after the introduction
of the home pregnancy test. LFAs are formatted on nitrocellulose strips
and make use of colored particles modified with antibodies.31 Particles are loaded onto a conjugate pad, resulting
in the formation of antigen–antibody complexes when a sample
is added. These complexes are immobilized further downstream by capture
molecules, thus accumulating the detection-particle color (generally
in a line).32 LFAs illustrate the merits
of integrative paper-based approaches.

The most recent development
in paper-based analysis has been the
introduction by the Cooks group of paper spray ionization (PSI)33,34 for MS. The sample is deposited onto a sharp tip cut out of paper,
which is then aligned in front of a mass spectrometer. When solvent
and a high potential are applied, electrospray is generated at the
tip, and the sample is introduced to the MS. In PSI, the sample generally
does not require preprocessing, due to paper’s extractive properties.
Since its introduction, more advanced PSI methods have been reported,
which take advantage of a number of additional properties of paper.35−41

Building Function into Paper Devices
Capillary
Action and Flow Control
The passive wicking
behavior of fluids in paper is governed by capillary action, which
was described in 1921 by Edward Washburn.6Equation 1, which was
derived from the Poiseuille equation relating flow rate to pressure
drop (assuming that the coefficient of slip at the capillary wall
is zero), is used to describe capillary action in a capillary. 1  

The linear fluid front velocity (dl/dt) is influenced by liquid properties
(surface tension γ and viscosity η), capillary radius
(r), and the contact angle between liquid and capillary
(θ). It also depends on the gravitational acceleration on Earth
(g, 9.8 m/s2) of a liquid having a density
(ρ), that has traveled a certain distance through the capillary
(ls) with the capillary positioned at
an angle (ψ) to the horizontal axis. Furthermore, linear velocity
decreases as ls increases. If we consider
paper as a collection of parallel capillaries (admittedly somewhat
of a simplification42), this equation still
applies, but then the “radius” relates to the average
pore size.6 Since eq 1 was derived for capillary flow, it does not
take evaporation into account, which limits fluid propagation in an
open system and fluid drag over the paper.42,43

Changing any of the variables in eq 1 will alter the linear velocity. For example,
to obtain
increased velocity, we can use a liquid with high surface tension
(such as water), low viscosity (such as methanol), or (if flow runs
upward) low density. Alternatively, lowering the surface energy of
paper increases the contact angle of a liquid with high surface tension,
and can slow down44−46 or stop19,20,23 capillary flow. Decreasing the surface energy of cellulose can be
achieved by either physically depositing material into the pores19,20,47 or chemically bonding groups
to hydroxyl groups on cellulose.23

Yet another way to influence flow velocity through paper is to
change its geometric dimensions. Decreasing r leads
to decreased flow velocity and can be achieved by compressing paper48 or by initially choosing a different type of
paper. Deviation from a uniform rectangular paper strip affects flow
rates as well.49−51 In lateral flow assays (LFAs), an absorbent pad is
placed at the end of the strip to sustain flow.30,32 Alternatively, if a rectangular strip expands into a fanlike shape,
the volumetric flow rate through the rectangular strip will shift
from decreasing to quasi-stationary.49−51 The length of a strip
of paper determines with which velocity a fluid reaches its end and
proceeds to the next stage of the device. One can, for example, controllably
time different solutions to arrive in a central chamber by choosing
appropriate lengths for their respective supply wicks.49,52

We can also look into ways of controlling fluid movement over
the
surface of a wetted paper strip, instead of through the strip itself.
In this case, wetted paper acts as a “wall” in a thin
solution conduit. This can be achieved by e.g. scratching the paper
in the direction of flow to create an open channel53 or by aligning the paper surface parallel to another paper
or non-paper surface that is at least partially wettable by the liquid
used.54,55 Solution is then wicked between the surface
of the wetted paper and the second surface. This form of capillary
transport has the advantage that it is far more rapid than flow through
porous cellulose networks alone.

The Paper Microfluidic
Toolbox
Early paper microfluidic
devices (2007–2010) relied mainly on hydrophobic flow restrictions,
specifically used for splitting up a flow into multiple streams.20,47,56−60 Since then, the field has evolved to introduce new
ways to functionalize devices. In this section, we consider the paper
microfluidic toolbox and identify which tools we have (Figure 3, color-coded) and which remain
un(der)developed (Figure 3, black). We then look into possibilities for devices with
higher levels of integration achieved by combining different tools.

Figure 3 Paper
microfluidic toolbox. The two central rows represent categories
of tools, with color-coded examples in adjacent pieces (above or below).
Black pieces represent tools that are still missing from the tool
box. Pumps: absorbent pad32 (P1), fan51 (P2). Splitters: 2D20 (S1), 3D56 (S2). Valves: mechanical62 (V1), fluidic disconnects63 (V2). Barriers: dissolvable52 (B1), selectively permeable46 (B2). Fluidic
timers: geometrical52 (T1), compressed48 (T2). Two-phase flows: countercurrent65 (2P1). Mixers: surface acoustic wave function66 (M1), geometrical61 (M2). Gradient: branched68 (G1), stacked69 (G2). Filters: Y-filter61 (F1), membrane70 (F2). Electrokinetic
separation: isotachophoresis72 (E1), ion
concentration polarization73 (E2). Concentrators:
affinity based75 (C1), bulk76 (C2). Detectors: colorimetric/smartphone (D1),
electrochemical77 (D2).

Basic paper microfluidic tools are passive pumping61 (see Capillary Action and
Flow Control and Figure 3-P1/P2)
and flow-splitting features (Figure 3-S1/S2) to guide the sample toward a number of different
reagents simultaneously.20,59 For any paper device,
the length of paper that can be used is limited, due to the decrease
in flow rates as a function of distance traveled by the solvent front
(eq 1).49 The number of times a channel can be split is equally limited
(Figure 3-S1). However,
when multiple layers of paper are stacked, a third physical dimension
is added,56 in which we can selectively
separate regions in different layers with hydrophobic layers having
the thickness of a piece of tape, or one sheet of paper. This is well
below the width of 2D patterns on paper. With the 3D approach, we
can thus split a flow many more times within a given distance of porous
material (Figure 3-S2).

One of the oldest paper microfluidic tools is the mechanical valve,
operated by disconnecting and (re)connecting different paper regions
(Figure 3-V1).23,62 Alternatively, wicks of a certain length can be suspended into a
liquid, and the contact between those will be discontinued when the
liquid level drops below a certain point (Figure 3-V2).54,63 We can also modify
paper physically or chemically to manipulate flows. For instance,
a temporary barrier can be formed through application of a dissolvable
material52,64 (Figure 3-B1). When the applied material is not dissolvable,
it alters the surface properties of paper and can be used to slow
down or even stop flow.44,45 In the latter case,
a solvent with different surface energy can be used to cross the barrier,
thus achieving solvent-based on/off valving (Figure 3-B2).46 Another
way to influence flow rates is to use fluidic timers (see Capillary Action and Flow Control and Figure 3-T1/T2)52,63 to ensure that compounds arrive at a common location at different
times.

We can also consider introducing
multiple streams of fluid with
the express interest of allowing them to interact. We can, for example,
use selective coatings to locally alter paper surface energies to
allow countercurrent flow of two immiscible solvents (2P1).65 Moreover, we can mix miscible solvents on paper
by applying an external force, such as acoustic wave functions (Figure 3-M1).66 Alternatively, providing a suitable path length
and contact between two streams (e.g., by overlapping strips of paper)
allows mixing through dispersion (Figure 3-M2).61 When mixing
is incomplete, or when liquids are guided to interact through a branched
network of channels, concentration gradients can be formed67,68 (Figure 3-G1). Concentration
gradients can also be created by using 3D paper microfluidic stacks
that are only supplied with a nutrient or gas from one side69 (Figure 3-G2). Diffusion across the interface between two side by side
flows can also be used to separate compounds, as is achieved with
the Y-filter (Figure 3-F1).61 Furthermore, filtration or separation
can be achieved by tuning the pore size of the device. An example
of this is the integration of a membrane that does not allow the passage
of blood cells (Figure 3-F2)70 to extract serum from whole blood.

Another popular approach to achieve separations, and potentially
orders of magnitude concentration increases, is to employ electric
fields. Isotachophoresis (Figure 3-E1) can be used to focus the charged analyte in small
bands on a paper substrate.71,72 The use of ion concentration
polarization, in which ions are concentrated by application of an
electric field over an ion-selective membrane/region, has been demonstrated
as a possibility for on-paper concentration as well (Figure 3-E2).73 However, electrokinetic approaches require additional instrumentation
and are only applicable to charged analytes. Therefore, the most common
approach is affinity-based preconcentration of specific molecules
on paper, as done in LFAs (Figure 3-C1).74,75 Instrument-free preconcentration
of a bulk sample can be easily achieved by depositing a surplus of
sample behind water-impermeable barriers, drying it, and eluting the
concentrate with a stronger solvent76 (Figure 3-C2).

We have
also identified paper microfluidic tools that are currently
missing from the toolbox. Think here of on-paper serial dilution,
and electronic control and actuation of paper microfluidic functions.
The first steps toward their development have been reported. Simple
dilution was demonstrated while proving the feasibility of a stacked
mixer.61 A significant level of integration
of electronic actuation has been shown in an example of pulsatile
generation of colored bands by electrochemistry78 and electrokinetic separations.71,72 Also missing is the use of transparent materials to better visualize
what is going on inside paper microfluidic devices. Such material
can also be used to improve optical detection through background reduction
and better penetration. Oils have been used to change refractive index
and thus perform spectrophotometric and fluorescent detection in a
paper format.79 However, transparent paper,
which has already been developed,80 has
not been implemented.

Other true challenges still lie ahead,
especially the application
of active flow control (rather than passive pumps) to alter flow rates
during an experiment, and online off-paper extraction of sample or
product. Advances in the application of more (active) flow control
result from the fabrication of channel-like structures on paper53−55 to achieve higher flow rates, or the combination of paper-based
devices with a digital microfluidic approach.81 Off-line extraction is achieved easily by cutting out a piece of
the paper device and extracting its load,61 but this is a relatively irreproducible operation and results in
substantial dilution. Both active flow control and online extraction
may require the integration of the paper substrate in a container
or casing to ensure that liquids cannot leave the paper via its pores
and to be able to connect the paper strip to external components.

Now, imagine we need a point-of-care test to see if the level of
a certain drug in a blood sample is within the therapeutic range.
We can start constructing this from the building blocks in Figure 3. First, we need
a user-friendly way to acquire the right sample volume. Paper’s
passive pump will fill the substrate with sample, but we need valves
to define a fixed amount. The sample matrix is complex; therefore,
we install a mechanical filter to separate serum from the larger constituents
of blood. Drug concentrations are often low, so that preconcentration
of the filtrate is necessary. We then split the sample into different
channels, where they are mixed with varying concentrations of the
compound of interest for on-paper calibration. The choice of detection
depends strongly on the assay itself, but will most likely be based
on colorimetry (see Detection and Readout Platforms
for Paper Devices). Furthermore, in order to make this setup
easy to operate, it needs encasing (see Cartridge-Based
Paper Analytics). By using this modular approach, we can easily
select which tools are required to solve a problem as well as identify
which tools still need to be developed.

Detection and Readout Platforms
for Paper Devices
Detection
is an important parameter in this discussion about integrated paper-based
platforms. First and foremost, whatever detector is selected, it should
be intuitive to operate but also portable and inexpensive, all of
which is in line with the philosophy underlying on-site analyses (Figure 4). We can roughly
distinguish three different approaches for paper-based analysis,32,82,83 namely, the unaided eye, digital
colorimetry, and instrumental analysis.

Figure 4 Required components of
a fully functional μPAD from scientific
and societal points of view.

A large number of paper-based assays, such as the pregnancy
test,
are interpreted simply by eye. Advantages of this approach are numerous,
but only if we are interested in a qualitative answer, whereas many
analytical tests require a quantitative outcome. Paper microfluidics
has made a valuable contribution to readout with the unaided eye,
through the implementation of easily interpretable and even legible
results, such as an immunoassay that displays a patient’s blood
type in patterned letters.84

The
second, and very popular, approach is (digital) colorimetry.
The reason for its popularity is very simple. To acquire results,
it is enough to have a digital camera, which we find in every smartphone.82 Reactions giving a colorimetric response are
numerous and include chemical reactions,20,85,86 enzymatic reactions,87 and immunoassays.88 Such approaches
offer a sufficient detection limit for many medical and environmental
purposes.83 However, the smartphone may
not always be equally suitable as a detector, for the reasons discussed
below.

The third category is instrumental analysis, a major
representative
of which is electrochemical detection.89−91 Electrochemistry offers
sensitivity and can be used for many well-described medical and environmental
tests. However, it requires a number of adaptations for use on paper,
as well as dedicated instrumentation to carry out the test.82,83,92 PSI and many DBS analyses also
fall into this category, since they rely on MS detection of sample
on paper, via direct ionization or extraction, respectively. Since
the biggest application fields for paper-based assays are point of
care and environmental analysis, it has become clear that readout
platforms should be portable and user friendly. Consequently, it seems
paradoxical to develop paper-based tests which rely on laboratory-based
instrumental analysis. Still, efforts in the miniaturization of readout
platforms are making headway as well. A rather spectacular development
in this respect, outside the scope of this article, is the field of
miniaturized MS.93−95 Electrochemical detection is more easily miniaturized,
as electrodes can be printed on paper and implemented using (trans)portable
potentiostats.93−95

Recently, smartphone cameras, or adaptors with
a built-in detector,
have been applied for data acquisition, using a software app for interpretation.82 It is important to note the distinct difference
between these two approaches, as smartphone cameras are used in this
regard as the actual detection unit, whereas the adaptor approach
employs the smartphone as a hand-held computer only. This “smart
approach” contributes to the development of portable readout
platforms for on-site assays but has numerous drawbacks as well. A
crucial problem associated with smartphone-camera-based detection
for diagnostic tests is that all smartphones produced globally would
require certification (FDA-approved or similar), which is simply impossible.
For tests which only give indicative, preliminary, or lifestyle information,
however, there is more hope. Currently, it is possible to test yourself
for alcohol, drugs, and allergies,96 and
tests for environmental monitoring have also been reported.97

An additional concern for the use of smartphones
comes from the
contamination risk posed by the tested samples. There is a realistic
danger of infecting/exposing the smartphone user, should his or her
personal phone be used to test a potentially hazardous sample. Dedicated
readout platforms, specifically developed for on-site analyses, give
more freedom for the design and packaging of a device with special
technical features. It is then probably easier to obtain the necessary
approval for medical use. Furthermore, this reduces the threat of
pathogen carryover from a sample to the user.

Cartridge-Based Paper Analytics
In commercial products,
the test is often enclosed in a cartridge. Fitting a paper-based test
into a cartridge can serve many purposes that enhance the end-user
experience, test functionality, or both. Use of a cartridge to enhance
end-user experience is exemplified in such well-known examples as
the pregnancy test. Here, the cartridge serves as protection, integrative
casing, and easy-to-use interface, in addition to having a professional
and reliable appearance. The cartridge is paramount for both a successful
experiment in terms of reliability and reproducibility and a potential
future product in terms of operational simplicity and appeal. The
cartridge is also used to add functionality to the test by, for instance,
imparting additional control over fluid flows by capillary action
between paper and the surface of the cartridge.54 Movable features36 may be integrated,
as can mechanical support, to achieve functional alignment of paper
and non-paper components. It is also possible to integrate other materials
and objects into the assay (e.g., electrodes).98

In the case of paper-based tests, integration into
a cartridge is often a logical step in the development process. When
we encounter a practical problem and try to solve it in the laboratory,
we often envision a slick device that is ready for the market. In
reality, however, we often end up building a setup “McGyver-style”
which cannot be used by anyone except the inventors. The design and
fabrication of a cartridge by most processes can be a costly and time-consuming
affair. Furthermore, it limits the number of changes that can be made
to the device later on. Many researchers have therefore started to
rely on rapid prototyping approaches,99−102 the newly crowned king of which
is 3D printing. This technology is very affordable nowadays, and even
low-end printers can be used for producing casings and cartridges.
The added benefit of 3D-printing approaches is that the entire development
and production process is kept in house, thus drastically reducing
production time.

Applications of Paper in (Bio-)Chemical Analysis
Biochemistry
on Paper
Paper-based analytical devices
(μPADs)20 based on biochemical reactions
are of particular interest for paper-based diagnostic83,103,104 and environmental assays.105 There has been a tendency to omit LFAs from
this μPAD category. To the best of our knowledge, however, no
formal definition exists for paper microfluidics that would justify
this omission. An obvious and historically justified definition (History of Paper in Science and Figure 2) could be “the controlled
manipulation of small quantities of liquid in and through a porous
(cellulose) network”. Seen in this context, one could argue
that LFAs are simply one of the many possible embodiments of paper
microfluidics. In this section, we broadly discuss paper-based biochemical
assays and, in doing so, present a comparison of established LFAs
and the newer μPADs (Table 1).

Biochemistry is the chemistry of biologically active
molecules,
such as enzymes and antibodies, which are generally more prone to
degradation in comparison to small molecules. Biochemical analysis
generally utilizes these biomolecules in multistep processes including
immobilization and binding steps, which require devices with integrated
multifunctionality to carry out. The LFA is specifically designed
and optimized for this purpose, whereas the μPAD is still often
based on one-step reactions, with additional operational steps for
the user.103 In both LFAs and μPADs,
colorimetry is mostly employed as a readout. However, where LFAs mostly
rely on qualitative interpretation by the user, detection in most
μPADs is of a quantitative nature, and the range of applied
analytical techniques is vast (see Detection and
Readout Platforms for Paper Devices).

With respect to
the performance of LFAs and μPADs, one could
contend that LFAs have a more intricate and complete design in comparison
to many μPADs. However, more recently we see that the field
of paper microfluidics has begun to implement additional functionality
and complexity.83,92,103,105−108 Recent advances in LFA development include dedicated readout platforms
(for example: http://www.lateralflowreader.com/ and http://www.alere.com/en/home.html) and multiplexing (http://symbolicsdx.com/). However, the main strategy behind present-day LFA development
appears to be their successful implementation for new applications.
While most individual μPADs might not be as sophisticated as
the LFA, the total scope of their applicability is immense and covers
many areas of analytical science.

With respect to user friendliness,
LFAs surpass the majority of
μPADs, because they are straightforward to operate, are hand-held,
and yield unambiguous results. Arguably though, μPADs to date
have been mostly proof-of-concept devices. Current drawbacks of μPADs
in this regard are that they require more input from the user, and
that their size can range from something as small as a postage stamp
to a complete, laboratory-based setup.

Before μPADs can
achieve market or societal success comparable
to that of LFAs, they must obtain an edge over these in terms of e.g.
user friendliness, integrated functionality, and cost. A higher level
of integration is achievable by the implementation of still un(der)exploited
functionalities (see The Paper Microfluidic Toolbox). Moreover, the fact that a quantitative answer is desired85,109 in many applications offers opportunities for μPADs. Figure 4 describes the ideal
μPAD, which integrates the flexibility of μPADs with lessons
learned from LFAs.

One of the great values of paper-based devices
is the possibility
of taking a standard laboratory test and performing it on site.20,109 A great example from biochemistry in this regard is the paper-based
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can be a game-changing approach
for diagnosis and pathogen identification in low-resource settings.
The first success reported was the use of a paper device to identify
Ebola RNA using isothermal amplification, namely reverse transcription
recombinase polymerase amplification.110 This work amply proves the possibility of efficient application
of PCR in a μPAD format and its contribution to overcoming contemporary
societal problems such as outbreaks of Ebola.

Paper Spray Ionization:
Mass Spectrometric Detection
Since its conception in 2010,
PSI has experienced a rapid increase
in the number of reported applications.93,111 Most of this
work focuses on the employment of this ambient ionization method to
applications using unmodified paper tips (Figure 5A). Additionally, attention has been devoted
to the improvement and functionalization of the method (Figure 5B–H). In this section,
we discuss a number of these improvements (Figure 5, top panel) and consider them from an integrative
point of view (Figure 5, bottom panel), extrapolating future directions for PSI, and paper-based
analytics in general.

Figure 5 Functionalization of PSI. The top row shows individual
improvements
to the method. The second row shows how individual developments may
be combined for more integrated functionality.

One obvious choice for the functionalization of PSI tips
is the
integration of paper microfluidics to create “smart tips”.
However, only recently have we seen the first reports that demonstrate
such a union.35,112 Up to now, we have seen PSI
tips with straight channels (Figure 5B), which help to reduce lateral diffusion as well
as increase the electrical field strength, allowing the use of lower
potentials. Furthermore, we have seen the introduction of selectively
permeable valves on paper tips to preconcentrate the sample.76 The PSI–paper microfluidics marriage
yields many interesting options for future exploration, which can
be viewed as “functionalization of PSI tips”, or in
broader terms as “MS detection for paper microfluidics”.
In principle, any paper microfluidic structure could be patterned
on a PSI tip, functionalizing it e.g. for sampling, chemical derivatization,
or improved separation.

Spray time, which is conventionally
limited to approximately 1
min, can be significantly extended by passively supplying solvent
from a reservoir via a hydrophilic wick54,113 or a supply
channel114,115 (Figure 5C). Once a continuous solvent supply is ensured, we
can perform an online paper chromatographic separation with MS detection54,116 (Figure 5D).

Since paper is a complex network of cellulose fibers, the microstructure
of a macroscopic tip is difficult to reproduce properly, which might
cause differences in spray intensity and stability during and between
experiments. One approach to solve this problem is to attach a capillary
to the tip to serve as the emitter117 (Figure 5E). This way, we
can use paper with its useful characteristics (separation, passive
fluid propagation), while relying on a capillary emitter for reproducible
spray stability.

Sample application to the paper tip generally
consists of a single
sampling moment but might require sampling at a certain frequency.
Periodic sampling from a system that requires continuous monitoring
can be achieved by slowly pumping the solution through a capillary,
which then drips the sample onto the paper tip38 (Figure 5F). If a steady supply of solvent and a stable spray is ensured,
sample can be directly “injected” into the flow.

Proof-of-concept setups are often bulky, not very reproducible,
and certainly not user friendly. All of these problems can be solved
using a single solution, namely putting the paper tip into a disposable
cartridge36,40,93,115,118 (Figure 5G). The cartridge not only
protects the tip but provides physical support, allows easy positioning
in a complementary holder, and can integrate features such as solvent
reservoirs and sample delivery systems (see also section 2.4).

As we all want to do as many analyses
as possible in the least
amount of time, multiplexing is imperative. So-called “high-throughput”
PSI was reported by mounting a number of paper tips next to each other
and moving them along past the mass spectrometer orifice39 (Figure 5H).

As a result of integration, we can end up with a
system which exhibits
improved sensitivity due to hydrophobic patterning, improved spray
stability due to the capillary emitter, longer spray time due to the
hydrophilic wick in a solvent reservoir, and improved integration,
protection, and stability by incorporation into a cartridge. All of
these features improve PSI, without putting additional demands upon
the user. If anything, it makes PSI easier to use. It is therefore
rather surprising that most PSI applications published to date do
not implement this type of development. Moreover, there are optional
functions such as multiplexing and periodic sampling which, though
definitely not needed in every application, can greatly contribute
in some.

Paper-Based Cell Cultivation Systems
In the past decade,
microfluidic systems for cell cultures have been increasingly employed
to bridge the gap between well-plate cultures and animal studies,
by striving for in vivo-like conditions in specially designed in vitro
systems.119−124 However, these achievements often come with expensive device fabrication
techniques and relatively complicated system operation. Recently,
paper has been introduced as a viable candidate for the simplification
of various cell-culture platforms.69,124,125 The most relevant question for the development of
paper-based cell cultivation, as is the case for any new cell culture
platform, is whether it better resembles in vivo conditions in comparison
to conventional cell culture platforms. This section addresses that
question.

When paper is used for cell cultivation, the pores
of paper serve as a 3D mesh to contain them, while the same paper
can simultaneously contain integrated sensors. Paper can support cell
cultures either directly by providing a surface for cell attachment69 or indirectly as a scaffold for deposition of
cells in hydrogel.126 Moreover, paper can
be easily modified and prepared for different cell types, ranging
from immortalized cell lines to sensitive primary cell cultures, including
stem cells.127 Other benefits are the low
price of the material, biocompatibility, and accessibility.

The passive wicking of liquids through paper can be employed to
regulate continuous nutrient delivery, whereas the open architecture
allows unhindered gas exchange with the direct environment. In addition,
paper-based cell cultivation can benefit from the ease with which
new features can be integrated into a device,69,126,128 especially for 3D cell cultures.
For example, stacking sheets of paper with cultivated cells results
in a 3D construct that can be used for monitoring cell–cell
interaction and nutrient distribution.69,124,125,127 Furthermore, this
allows for disassembly of the layers and separate analysis of different
cell types in those layers. Stacking layers with different chemical
content, or with different distances to a source of nutrients, results
in the formation of gradients for the study of e.g. nutrient/waste
transport or the oxygenation level of a culture.69

Another elegant demonstration of paper for cell cultures
was the
cultivation of neurons, which formed functional connections through
the paper and could transfer electrical impulses.129 The features of paper primarily contributing to this work
were porosity, which allowed the neurons to develop in 3D, the structural
modifiability of paper, which allowed directional growth of the neurons,
and the low electrical conductivity of the material.

Paper is
a good matrix as well for the cultivation and identification
of bacteria and tests of their antibiotic resistance.130 This assay was inspired by standard Petri-dish
cultures and therefore successfully exemplifies how one can adapt
existing tests and make them broadly applicable, also outside the
microbiological laboratories. Tests for antimicrobial resistance on
paper can be easily multiplexed in terms of identifying multiple pathogens
and evaluating the resistance to different antibiotics.

Some
approaches in cell culture could actually be easier to achieve
with paper than with standard labware. For example, the printing and
deposition of cells (in medium or hydrogel) on cultivation devices
should be simple, because cells and their matrix will be directly
retained within the porous network. This would have an additional
benefit in heterogeneous cell cultures where different cell types
have to be spatially separated or arranged in a fashion which helps
to emulate their function (e.g., smooth muscle cells below endothelial
cells).

The most popular method for cell inspection is microscopy,
which
is not fully compatible with paper-based cell cultures, due to the
opacity of paper. This obstacle can potentially be overcome with the
application of transparent paper80 for
paper-based cell culture systems. Transparent paper differs from opaque
paper, because the cellulose fibers have a smaller diameter and their
density in the sheet is higher.

Perspectives
There
are a number of challenges ahead if paper-based assays are
to provide society with the tools to perform the on-site analyses
we keep talking about. Below are our conclusions, drawn from our observation
of the field, which can be taken into consideration as recommendations
for future paper-based research.

(1) Learn from previous successes.
For example, LFAs are viable,
paper-based, commercial products that address societal demand for
fast, easy-to-use diagnostics. While LFAs are not as diverse as paper
microfluidics, they are great examples of optimized devices for on-site
analysis, to the point that they can literally be used by anyone.
This is highly important for paper microfluidics as well, yet has
not always been taken into account. For instance, researchers still
use pipets for sample application and complicated or insufficient
readout systems for paper microfluidics.

(2) Look beyond the
piece of paper. Conventional microfluidics
(and other fields) can inspire increased functionality in paper-based
devices. Cartridges can be applied for integrating various functional
elements, adding functionality, and if nothing else, making paper
devices easier to handle and appealing. Integration of electronics
on paper or applying hybrid patterning strategies can further extend
the possibilities.

(3) Think top-down, rather than bottom-up.
It is fair to say that
academic research does not need to be immediately translatable into
products, but this is exactly what justifies paper microfluidics.
We should identify an analytical problem and design the solution,
rather than defining a problem that suits the solution. We can then
start working our way down to focus on the individual components that
are required.

(4) Focus on expanding the paper microfluidic
toolbox. Some tools
are still completely absent. Others have been invented but are still
in an early stage of development. Integration is important, but in
order to develop complete assays, we need to keep working on the components.
Paper has many different favorable characteristics, each of which
can be viewed as an additional dimension to operate in, an additional
level of complexity for the device.

(5) Re-evaluate smartphone
detection. It is impossible to calibrate
and certify each and every smartphone for diagnostic readout. However,
it is possible to do this for dedicated readout devices, which would
also be more affordable than a smartphone. Furthermore, the possible
contamination of a smartphone with samples bears health risks for
the owner. Having said that, smartphones can be attractive detectors
for assays with a less regulated result, such as home tests for certain
lifestyle markers or scanning tests to identify epidemiological trends
or samples that should be submitted for FDA-approved testing.

(6) Identify patterns in patterning strategies. Many patterning
approaches have been described, each differing in one way or the other.
It is important that we characterize and categorize the different
types of barriers, so that we can make educated decisions as to which
barrier to use for a given application. Most barriers can confine
aqueous solutions, but little effort has been dedicated to testing
them with more challenging solutions, containing e.g. detergents or
alcohols.

(7) Customer demand is as important as the technology.
In the case
of diagnostics, especially in low-resource settings, we cannot create
new demand but should rather recognize it and offer a solution which
addresses as many objectives as possible. Therefore, devices that
can answer more questions simultaneously in a reliable and accurate
fashion win out against solutions offering less information. Equally
true is that the less effort or input which is required to perform
the test, the more likely it is that it will be adopted by end users.
Importantly, we need to consider the dimensions and shape of the assay,
which preferably can be hand-held yet is not microscopic in size,
which could make it difficult to operate and easy to contaminate.
By applying a unique shape (or color), we can help the user recognize
a specific test and provide lock-key fitting into the readout device.

(8) Researchers often proudly announce that their μPAD costs
less than $0.01 per piece. However, this price is usually solely based
on the cost of the materials and reagents, and the price does not
include manpower or even the costs for the usage of laboratory space
and equipment. It is true that paper-based assays can be cheaper than
any other approach, but to this price we must add the cost of setting
up a production line ($150k–500k103), costs related to logistics, and profits for those involved in
μPAD development and production.

This perspective on paper
describes a number of scientific fields
that could benefit from choosing a more integrative approach toward
research. All of us doing research in one of these fields share a
common belief that paper is in fact the material that will help us
overcome the obstacles to successful on-site analysis in many application
fields. Such research could prove important for diagnosing those who
currently cannot be diagnosed due to financial, geographic, or cultural
restrictions. Paper has the potential to help us reach that goal,
if we continue to reinvent its application for analytical chemistry.

The
authors declare no
competing financial interest.
