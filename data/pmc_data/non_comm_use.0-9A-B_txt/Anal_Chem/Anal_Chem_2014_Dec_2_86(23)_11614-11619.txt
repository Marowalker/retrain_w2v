Surface-enhanced
Raman scattering (SERS) optical nanoprobes offer
a number of advantages for ultrasensitive analyte detection. These
functionalized colloidal nanoparticles are a multifunctional assay
component. providing a platform for conjugation to spectral tags,
stabilizing polymers, and biorecognition elements such as aptamers
or antibodies. We demonstrate the design and characterization of a
SERS-active nanoprobe and investigate the nanoparticles’ biorecognition
capabilities for use in a competitive binding assay. Specifically,
the nanoprobe is designed for the quantification of bisphenol A (BPA)
levels in the blood after human exposure to the toxin in food and
beverage plastic packaging. The nanoprobes demonstrated specific affinity
to a BPA aptamer with a dissociation constant Kd of 54 nM, and provided a dose-dependent SERS spectra with
a limit of detection of 3 nM. Our conjugation approach shows the versatility
of colloidal nanoparticles in assay development, acting as detectable
spectral tagging elements and biologically active ligands concurrently.

Raman scattering
techniques
have emerged as a unique tool in the development of blood biomarker
assays in providing characteristic chemical fingerprints, low limits
of detection, and capability for multiplexing due to narrow band widths.1 The Raman signal stems from the inelastic scattering
of photons
by a molecule’s electric cloud, providing a chemical fingerprint
of the analyte. Only about 1 in 108 incident photons undergoes
spontaneous Raman scattering, consequently causing the technique’s
intrinsically weak signal. In surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy
(SERS) electromagnetic enhancements are observed when the analyte
is in close proximity to a plasmonic surface such as metallic colloidal
nanoparticles.2−5 In colloidal SERS, this leads to signal enhancements of up to 1011 when the analyte is sandwiched within 1 nm of two gold spherical
particles.6,7 Nevertheless, SERS techniques utilizing
nanoparticles often lack reproducibility and specificity due to the
random nature of particle aggregation and the adsorption of molecules
onto the metal surface,3 making it difficult
to obtain quantitative analyte information. The integration of SERS
detection with biomolecular assays has been recently implemented through
the design of SERS nanoprobes: metallic nanoparticles conjugated to
molecules with specific optical and biochemical functionalities.8−10

SERS nanoprobes require three key conjugated elements: (1)
a Raman
reporter molecule (RRM) for quantitative identification, (2) a protective
element for particle stabilization, and (3) a ligand for assay-specific
biorecognition.8 Strong Raman bands are
attributed to RRMs with a high Raman cross section, meaning the molecule’s
electron cloud is easily distorted by the excitation laser and thus
is polarizable.11,12 In order to reduce the number of Raman bands for simplified spectral multiplexing,
the RRM should also have a low atom count and/or be highly symmetrical.13−16 Furthermore, the RRM must provide a functional “head”
group for chemisorption to the nanoparticle, most commonly chosen
as a thiol (R–SH) for its well-defined covalent attachment
to gold.17,18 Formation of a self-assembled monolayer
(SAM) of RRMs on the nanoparticle surface allows for dense packing
of molecules with uniform orientation, improving the reproducibility
of the SERS signal.14,19−21 The RRM’s
terminal “tail” group type also contributes to the dynamics
of the nanoparticles as its charge directly affects the total particle
surface charge, determining the degree of electrostatic stabilization.22,23

Though a Raman reporter SAM can independently act as the nanoprobe’s
stabilizing capping agent, additional steric stabilization
is often desired for mechanical repulsion between particles. Conjugation
of polymers such as poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG)24−27 or poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP)14,28,29 to the nanoparticle as part of
a mixed SAM, to the RRM’s “tail” group, or silica
shell encapsulation14,30 of the particles drastically
improves the colloid’s shelf life, even under harsh conditions.
Sterically stabilized nanoprobes exhibit minimal nonspecific adsorption
and can also provide functionalized surfaces and binding sites for
further bioconjugation.

To provide a molecular affinity to the
SERS nanoprobe, a biorecognition
element (i.e., an antigen or antibody) must also be conjugated to
the particle, via a thiol to the gold directly, to the RRM, or to
the protective linker. Recently, aptamers, highly
specific and sensitive affinity molecules derived from nucleic acids,
have been used as SERS nanoprobe recognition ligands in lieu of typical
antibodies.31−37 Aptamers are specifically advantageous for sensing small molecules
with low immunogenicity, where raising antibodies would require synthesis
of a hapten–target carrier before animals can be immunized
with that conjugate.38 Selection of aptamers
is an entirely in vitro process with the ability to perform counterselection
steps and/or selection under nonblood conditions. This provides the
potential for greater ligand specificity and affinity, and once identified,
aptamers are readily produced by scalable chemical synthesis. Lastly,
aptamer terminal functional groups are readily incorporated during
synthesis for conjugation to the nanoparticle or other immobilization
assay steps.39

Aptamers are well-suited
for the detection of environmental carcinogens
in the blood, where animal immunizations with certain toxic haptens
are not possible or do not trigger an animal immune response.40 Bisphenol A (BPA) is the monomer of an epoxy
resin commonly used in plastic food and beverage packaging, and can
be toxic to the endocrine system when exposed to humans. Though environmental
monitoring of BPA in the air, water, and the food products themselves
is well-established and regulated, there is still a need for reliable
human biomonitoring methods in order to determine the body’s
burden with BPA and its metabolites in the blood.

In this work
a functional SERS nanoprobe with specific affinity
to a BPA-binding aptamer is characterized. The binding affinity of
the nanoprobe and its specificity to the BPA aptamer is quantified
using microscale thermophoresis (MST). This approach monitors the
signal depletion of a fluorescently labeled aptamer as it moves along
an induced temperature gradient.41,42 The thermophoresis
of molecules is size-dependent, and thus titration experiments are
used to quantify the aptamer–nanoparticle binding and determine
the dissociation constant Kd. The plasmonic
properties of these capture nanoprobes and their capabilities for
quantitative SERS detection are also investigated. We demonstrate
that the described SERS nanoprobes are capable of acting as both a
capture and detecting element for BPA assay development.

Experimental
Methods
According to the scheme in Figure 1, the
nanoprobe consists of a RRM and heterobifunctional PEG mixed SAM conjugated
to a BPA derivative, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE). The design
of the nanoprobe, reliable reaction conditions for its repeatable
production, and ratios of conjugates were optimized. Additionally,
the
affinity behavior of a BPA aptamer to the BADGE SERS nanoprobe was
characterized using MST. The ability to detect and quantify these
capture nanoprobes using SERS was explored, though aggregation of
the particles was required to reach the particle concentration range
of interest.

nanoprobes.

Materials
Citrate-reduced colloidal gold nanoparticles
with an average diameter of 60 nm were purchased from Polysciences
(no. 22717). Heterobifunctional PEG linker (NH2–PEG–SH)
with a molecular weight of 1 kDa was purchased from NanoCS. Bisphenol
A diglycidyl ether (BADGE), 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA), 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES), and 200 proof ethanol (EtOH) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
The BPA-specific aptamer 5′-CCG CCG TTG GTG TGG TGG GCC TAG
GGC CGG CGG CGC ACA GCT GTT ATA GAC GTC TCC AGC-3′47 was synthesized with a 5′-Cy5 fluorescent
dye by Eurofins Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany). Similarly, nonspecific
aptamers were also obtained from Eurofins. Milli-Q ultrapure water
(18 MΩ) was used in all procedures.

Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
images were acquired on a JEM-2010 TEM (JEOL, Japan) system. UV–vis–NIR
extinction spectra were recorded by a Tecan Infinite 200 Pro (Tecan
Group Ltd., Switzerland) microplate reader with a scan range of 400–900
nm, using 300 μL of each sample in a 96-well plate. The ζ-potential
and hydrodynamic diameters of the nanoparticles were measured on a
Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern, U.K.). All Raman and SERS spectra were
collected using a Thermo Scientific DXR Raman confocal microscope.
A 396-well plate (30 μL of sample per well) was used for all
liquid SERS measurements. Samples were excited with a 5 mW, 780 nm
laser through a 10× microscope, using an exposure time of 5 s,
where each scan comprises 30 exposures. Microscale thermophoresis
data sets were collected using a NanoTemper MST system at 2Bind Molecular
Interactions (2Bind, Germany).

Au/MBA/PEG/BADGE SERS Nanoprobe
Synthesis
To synthesize
1 mL of nanoprobes, 10 μL of HEPES buffer (1 M at pH ∼9)
was first added to 1 mL of 60 nm gold nanoparticles (∼24 pM
stock solution, where nanoparticle concentrations are calculated by
Beer–Lamberts’ law using the measured absorbance of
the nanoparticles and an extinction coefficient of 5.32 × 1010 M–1 s–1). Nanoparticle
characterization of the stock gold colloid can be found for comparison
in Figure 2. Solutions of the Raman reporter
molecule 4-MBA (120 μL of 10 μM in 100% EtOH) and the
linker NH2–PEG–SH (80 μL of 10 μM
in 10 mM HEPES at pH ∼9) were then added dropwise to 1 mL of
the gold nanoparticle solution under vigorous stirring. The mixed
SAM components were allowed to bind with the gold via their −SH
terminal groups for 4 h, to ensure complete SAM formation.

of the conjugated gold nanoparticles; (b) size distribution
of unconjugated gold (blue) and BADGE conjugated nanoprobes (black),
measured by dynamic light scattering; (c) extinction spectra plotted
vs wavelength for unconjugated gold (blue), BADGE conjugated gold
nanoprobes (red), and centrifugally aggregated nanoprobes (black).

Unbound reporter and linker molecules
were removed by centrifuging
the solution for 10 min at 4000 rpm and redispersing the precipitate
in 10 mM HEPES buffer. BADGE was then conjugated to the nanoparticle
via its epoxide, binding with the PEG linker’s terminal amine
group; 100 μL of 10 μM of BADGE in 10 mM HEPES was added
dropwise to the nanoprobe solution under vigorous stirring and allowed
to react overnight. The particles were then washed twice by centrifuging
(4000 rpm/10 min) and resuspending the precipitate in a 40% EtOH/H2O solution, followed by mild sonication. It was approximated
that there are 7.5 × 104 Raman reporter molecules
(4-MBA) and 5.0 × 104 aptamer binding molecules (BADGE)
conjugated to each gold nanoparticle where the concentration of nanoparticles
after conjugation is calculated to be 16 pM.

Microscale Thermophoresis
Aptamer Binding Measurements
For MST measurements, a Monolith
NT.115 Pico instrument (Nanotemper,
Munich, Germany) was employed. Fifteen capillaries of the instrument
were filled with 15 serial dilutions of the BADGE SERS nanoprobes
starting from the stock particle concentration of 16 pM, corresponding
to an estimated total solution BADGE concentration range of 800 nM
to 20 pM. The BPA aptamer and unspecific aptamer concentrations were
held constant in each capillary at 5 nM. A fluorescent measurement
of the cold solution is made before turning the IR heating laser on
(laser power 80%, LED power 15%, temperature 25 °C). Once the
laser is on, the fluorescence in the capillary is measured as the
aptamers/aptamer–nanoparticle conjugates move toward the colder
outer walls of the capillary tubes. This fluorescent signal is used
to quantify binding induced size changes, and the fraction of aptamer
bound as a function of analyte concentration is calculated according
to Baaske et al.41 A technical replicate
of each fluorescent measurement set was made. This experiment was
repeated using 5 nM of the BPA-aptamer and 15 serial dilutions of
BPA in free solution for a concentration range of 10 μM to 310
pM. The dissociation constants, or Kd,
were calculated from the resulting sigmoidal curves using the built-in
Hill1 sigmoidal fit in Origin 9.1

SERS Concentration Response
Measurements
Ten serial
dilutions of the BADGE SERS nanoprobes were performed starting from
the stock concentration of 16 pM corresponding to the total solution
BADGE concentration range of 800 nM to 40 pM and a total Raman reporter
(4-MBA) concentration range of 1.2 μM to 60 pM. Nested centrifuge
tubes were cut for easy integration with the Raman microscope system,
and 100 μL of each dilution was centrifuged at 10 000
rpm for 10 min. The solution was removed, and the precipitate was
allowed to dry overnight. The SERS intensity of the aggregates formed
at the bottom of each tube was then measured in triplicate and averaged
to represent the SERS response.

Results and Discussion
SERS Nanoprobe
Synthesis
The BADGE-functionalized SERS
nanoprobes were synthesized according to scheme in Figure 1 and are composed of (1) mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA)
acting as the RRM, (2) a heterobifunctional PEG linker providing steric
stabilization and protection from unwanted adsorption, and (3) the
analyte of interest, BADGE. TEM images of the BADGE SERS nanoprobes
demonstrate an average particle diameter of ∼60 nm, and dynamic
light scattering (DLS) measurements confirmed minimal aggregation
after conjugation with an average particle diameter reading of 86.1
nm (Figure 2, parts a and b). The ζ-potential
of the nanoprobes increased from −41.7 to −34.6 mV after
the mixed SAM was formed, due to the presence of terminal amines on
the PEG linker. After BADGE conjugation, epoxide groups replace the
amines and the ζ-potential decreased to −44.0 mV, indicating
adequate particle stabilization was achieved sterically by the PEG
and electrostatically by the 4-MBA’s terminal carboxylic acid
group.21,48

Aptamer–Nanoparticle Binding
The binding analytics
of the SERS nanoprobe to the BPA aptamer were quantified by the aptamer/target
dissociation constant Kd, as determined
by MST. Dilutions of the BADGE SERS nanoprobes, corresponding to 20
pM to 800 nM BADGE, were exposed to a constant 5 nM each of Cy5-labeled
BPA aptamer and nonspecific aptamer. The aptamer–nanoparticle
binding curves are shown in Figure 3, quantified
as the fraction of the total solution concentration of fluorescent
aptamer that is bound to SERS nanoprobes, as a function of total BADGE
concentration present in the nanoparticle solution. The dissociation
constant Kd was determined to be ∼54
nM for the BADGE nanoprobes, in comparison to 10 nM reported for free
BPA binding to the same aptamer.47 Additionally,
the Kd value for free BPA binding to the
BPA aptamer was determined experimentally using MST to be ∼100
nM (Supporting Information Figure S-1),
further validating the usefulness of the capture nanoprobe for future
competitive binding assay development. The control experiment using
a nonspecific aptamer was negative (Figure 3), demonstrating that the SERS nanoprobes are specific to the BPA
aptamer.

Figure 3 Binding behavior of the SERS nanoprobes to the published BPA-specific
aptamer (red, Kd ∼ 54 nM, r2 = 0.96) and a non-BPA-specific aptamer (black)
as measured by microscale thermophoresis (MST).

Plasmonic Properties of SERS Nanoprobes
The intrinsic
signal enhancement provided by a SERS substrate relies heavily on
the excitation of localized plasmons at the metallic surface by the
Raman excitation laser.11 This excitation
of plasmons causes a shift in magnitude in the metallic nanoparticle
extinction spectra, dependent on the size and stability of the particles.5,49 The extinction profile is representative of the scattered light
intensity as a function of excitation wavelength and, therefore, serves
as a predictor of the magnitude of the relative SERS enhancement.
In Figure 2c, the localized surface plasmon
resonance (LSPR) extinction band for unconjugated gold nanoparticles
is shown to be at 535 nm. After BADGE conjugation, the LSPR of the
nanoparticles is slightly red-shifted to 540 nm, which can be attributed
to the resultant increased particle diameter. Maximal SERS enhancements
are observed when the LSPR falls within a 240 nm window including
both the excitation wavelength and Raman-shifted wavelength,2 specifically 780 ± 120 nm for the excitation
laser used in this work. To shift their LSPR into this window and
achieve the SERS enhancements needed for nanomolar detection, the
nanoprobes were aggregated by centrifugation, and a secondary plasmon
band at 700 nm becomes apparent in the extinction spectra, as indicated
in Figure 2c.

The Raman spectra of the
reporter molecule 4-MBA in powder form, the SERS spectra of the nanoprobes
suspended in solution, and the SERS spectra of the nanoprobes after
centrifugal aggregation are compared in Figure 4. The strongest characteristic vibrational modes for 4-MBA occur
at ∼1075 and 1586 cm–1, corresponding to
the C–H in-plane bending (β18b) and C–C
stretching (ν8a) vibrational modes, respectively.50−52 These bands are evident in the intrinsic Raman and nanoprobe SERS
spectra (Figure 4), and are comparable to those
previously reported for 4-MBA bound to gold.14,20,30,51,53 Weaker Raman modes seen in the powdered 4-MBA spectrum
become visible in the SERS signal when the nanoprobes are aggregated
(Figure 4). Though some peaks are shifted or
broadened, the strongest peaks in the SERS nanoprobe signature correspond
to the published vibrational modes for 4-MBA (Table 1).

and (b) 30 μL of nanoprobes aggregated by centrifugation, and

SERS Response
The stock nanoprobe concentration was
the lowest detectable concentration using SERS in solution phase.
Therefore, 10 serial dilutions of the capture nanoprobes were centrifugally
aggregated, dried, and their SERS spectra monitored to investigate
the detection capabilities of the nanoprobes at the concentration
range of interest (Figure 5a). Features assigned
to the SERS nanoprobes’ Raman reporter (4-MBA) dominate the
spectra, until the concentration drops below ∼10 nM and the
area of aggregation becomes smaller than the laser spot size of 3.1
μm. At this point, peaks attributable to the polypropylene centrifuge
tube background begin to dominate the spectra, while the SERS nanoprobe
characteristic peaks at ∼1075 and 1586 cm–1 decrease until they are no longer distinguishable after six serial
dilutions (∼1.10 nM, Figure 5a). The
strongest polypropylene modes can be seen at 809 and 841 cm–1, corresponding to the C–C–C in-plane ring deformation
(α1)54,55 and C–H out-of-plane bending
(γ10a)55,56 vibrational modes,
respectively.

nanoprobes
at 10 concentrations ranging from 40 pM to 800 nM, offset for clarity.
(b) SERS intensity of the vibrational modes at 1075 and 1586 cm–1 with increasing volume of nanoprobes.

The SERS peak intensities of the vibrational modes
at 1075 and
1586 cm–1 as a function of concentration are shown
in Figure 5b. The trend follows a typical dose–response
curve, where the MBA peaks can be identified with a coefficient of
variation <25%, until the nanoparticle concentration drops below
600 fM (3.29 nM BADGE). This sensitivity is competitive with the quantification
limits previously reported for the detection of BPA levels in human
blood utilizing liquid chromatography (LC)–tandem mass spectrometry,
ranging from 0.4357 to 64 nM.58 It is noted that the standard error increases
with increasing concentration, likely due to the nonhomogeneous nature
of the aggregate formed using this method. For lower concentrations,
centrifugation causes the small volume of particles to distribute
evenly on the bottom of the tube. However, for higher volumes with
a visible precipitate, a higher density of nanoparticle junctions49 is formed, resulting in more areas of increased
SERS enhancements.11 Therefore, the analytical
range for this method is ∼3–300 nM. Though this detection
method for true quantitative analysis is impaired by high error from
“hot spots”, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates
that limited concentration information may be obtained using SERS
through the controlled aggregation of nanoparticles combined with
PEGylation and conjugation of the Raman reporter to the nanoparticle
as a self-assembled monolayer.

The limit of detection can be
reduced and the analytical range
shifted to suit a specific BPA aptamer assay through altering the
ratio and amount of PEG linker and Raman reporter molecule conjugated
to each particle. Modifying the amount or type of RRM directly affects
the SERS signal intensity, while adjustments made to the PEG linker
can be used to modify the distance between the particle and analyte,
to reduce charge based interactions with the nanoparticle surface,
or to alter the number of target analyte molecules per particle.26 The binding affinity of the aptamer to the functionalized
SERS nanoprobes may also be adjusted by changing the BPA derivative59 or synthesizing a BADGE derivative with only
one epoxy group so that its structure more closely resembles BPA.

Conclusion
This is the first report of the successful design
of a functionalized
SERS nanoparticle for specific binding to a BPA aptamer with an affinity
similar to that of the analyte in free solution. The particles provide
a characteristic Raman signature which can be enhanced through nanoparticle
aggregation and detected by SERS at concentrations as low as 600 fM.
The nanoprobes demonstrate colloidal stability for biological interaction
while providing functional conjugation to the BADGE analyte. The aptamer/nanoprobe
binding event is characterized through MST fluorescence measurements
and quantified by a dissociation constant of 54 nM. This demonstrates
the sensitive aptamer recognition capabilities of capture analytes
immobilized onto SERS-active nanoparticles with minimal perturbation
of the aptamer’s native, free-analyte binding.
