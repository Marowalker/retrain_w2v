Size-exclusion chromatography
employing aqueous mobile phases with
volatile salts at neutral pH combined with electrospray-ionization
mass spectrometry (SEC-ESI-MS) is a useful tool to study proteins
in their native state. However, whether the applied eluent conditions
actually prevent protein–stationary phase interactions, and/or
protein denaturation, often is not assessed. In this study, the effects
of volatile mobile phase additives on SEC retention and ESI of proteins
were thoroughly investigated. Myoglobin was used as the main model
protein, and eluents of varying ionic strength and pH were applied.
The degree of interaction between protein and stationary phase was
evaluated by calculating the SEC distribution coefficient. Protein-ion
charge state distributions obtained during offline and online native
ESI-MS were used to monitor alterations in protein structure. Interestingly,
most of the supposedly mild eluent compositions induced nonideal SEC
behavior and/or protein unfolding. SEC experiments revealed that the
nature, ionic strength, and pH of the eluent affected protein retention.
Protein–stationary phase interactions were effectively avoided
using ammonium acetate at ionic strengths above 0.1 M. Direct-infusion
ESI-MS showed that the tested volatile eluent salts seem to follow
the Hofmeister series: no denaturation was induced using ammonium
acetate (kosmotropic), whereas ammonium formate and bicarbonate (both
chaotropic) caused structural changes. Using a mobile phase of 0.2
M ammonium acetate (pH 6.9), several proteins (i.e., myoglobin, carbonic
anhydrase, and cytochrome c) could be analyzed by SEC-ESI-MS using
different column chemistries without compromising their native state.
Overall, with SEC-ESI-MS, the effect of nonspecific interactions between
protein and stationary phase on the protein structure can be studied,
even revealing gradual structural differences along a peak.

Assessment
of protein higher-order
structures (HOS) is critical, not only when defining the quality of,
for example, enzymes and biopharmaceuticals, but also in understanding
the function of these complex molecules. Changes in HOS can have a
significant impact on the biological activity and physicochemical
properties of proteins. As a result, there is an increasing demand
to analyze proteins in their native state, preferably under near-physiological
conditions.1−6 However, analysis of proteins while preserving their three-dimensional
structure remains challenging. This is related to the separation and
detection conditions imposed by analytical methodologies, which potentially
distort the structural integrity, molecular conformation, and/or activity
of proteins.4,7

A number of separation approaches
employing aqueous mobile phases
in principle allow preservation of the HOS of proteins. Exemplary
are capillary electrophoresis (CE),8,9 asymmetrical
flow-field flow fractionation (AF4),10−12 and size-exclusion chromatography
(SEC).2,13 The latter is regarded a golden standard
in many fields of application when it comes to size-based separation
of biomacromolecules. Commonly combined with light scattering detection
methodologies, SEC can provide insights into the physical size (hydrodynamic
volume) of macromolecules, from which for instance the compactness
of protein conformation or the extent of oligomerization may be deduced.4,11 Yet, more detailed structural information, e.g., on post-translational
modifications, requires hyphenation of SEC with mass spectrometry
(MS). Over the years, native electrospray ionization (ESI) has proven
to be very useful for obtaining multiply charged ions of intact proteins
under near-physiological conditions. ESI is soft and preserves protein
conformation and noncovalent interactions in the gas phase14−16 while providing the possibility to attain accurate molecular mass
information by high-resolution MS. Coupling of native ESI-MS to a
protein separation technique decreases the complexity of protein mass
spectra so that more meaningful information can be obtained.

Despite the advantages of hyphenating SEC to MS, there is a potential
risk that the applied separation conditions change the protein structure.17 Alterations might be due to, for instance, dilution
in the mobile phase or interaction with the stationary phase material.
Although SEC is considered a soft separation technique, separation
conditions need to be carefully considered in order to ensure reliable
conclusions are drawn on protein structures.2,13,18−20 It is, for example,
common practice to add organic solvents to the aqueous mobile phase
in order to improve the separation performance for protein and biopharmaceutical
characterization.18,21−27 However, protein conformation and aggregates may be affected even
by small percentages of organic solvent. Ideally, native SEC-ESI-MS
provides both optimal protein resolution and preservation of structural
integrity.

A number of studies have been reported using SEC-ESI-MS
under presumably
native conditions for the characterization of small oligomers,28 intact antibodies,19,23,24,29 and protein
aggregates.27 However, these studies were
mainly focused on the application and did not verify whether the analyzed
proteins were actually in their native state under the applied separation
conditions. Still, there are several studies using either SEC or ESI-MS
that show the importance of the choice of analytical conditions on
the conservation of the native state of proteins.30−33

In this study, the impact
that (volatile) mobile phases may have
on the retention and ionization of proteins during SEC-ESI-MS analysis
is investigated. For this, solutions of the most commonly used volatile
salts (ammonium acetate, formate, and bicarbonate) at varying ionic
strength and pH will be used. Myoglobin is selected as the model protein,
as it can reveal potential interactions with the stationary phase
during SEC separation34 and denaturation
during separation and ionization by monitoring of its charge state
distribution and loss of the hemichrome moiety.33,35−38 SEC of myoglobin using UV absorbance detection will be employed
to study the protein chromatographic behavior at the different conditions.
Subsequently, direct-infusion (DI) ESI-MS and SEC-ESI-MS experiments
are performed in order to assess potential protein denaturation during
ionization and separation, respectively. For verification, experiments
were performed using two different (in terms of column chemistry and
dimensions) SEC columns and by including an acidic (carbonic anhydrase;
CA) and basic (cytochrome C; CC) protein. The main goal of the study
was to reveal sources of protein denaturation during SEC analysis
by probing protein unfolding with native ESI-MS. Ultimately, from
these studies, suitable conditions for genuine native SEC-ESI-MS of
proteins could be derived.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
For
the mobile phase preparation, sodium
phosphate dibasic (≥98.5%), sodium phosphate monobasic (≥99.0%),
sodium sulfate (≥99.0%), and sodium azide (≥99.5%) from
Sigma-Aldrich (Schnelldorf, Germany) were used. For the preparation
of the volatile solutions used for DI-ESI-MS and SEC-ESI-MS experiments,
ammonium acetate (≥98%), ammonium formate (≥98%), and
ammonium bicarbonate (≥99.5%) from Sigma-Aldrich were used.
Solutions were adjusted to a final pH of 5.9, 6.9, or 7.5 with ammonium
hydroxide (28–30% NH3 in water), acetic acid (≥99%),
or formic acid (≥97%) from Sigma-Aldrich. A Milli-Q purification
system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) provided ultrapure water. The
gel-filtration protein standard (# 1511901) was purchased from Bio-Rad
Laboratories (California, United States). It contains thyroglobulin
(from bovine; MW, 670 kDa; pI, 4.5), γ-globulin (from bovine;
MW, 158 kDa; pI, 7.2), ovalbumin (from chicken; MW, 44 kDa; pI, 4.6),
myoglobin (from horse; MW, 17 kDa; pI, 7.2 (major component) and 6.8
(minor component)), and vitamin B12 (MW, 1350 Da). Carbonic anhydrase
isozyme II (from bovine erythrocytes; MW, 30 kDa; pI 5.4) and cytochrome
C (from equine heart; MW, 13 kDa; pI 10.8) were both purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich.

Sample Preparation
For the SEC-UV
experiments, 25 mg/mL
myoglobin (from horse heart, Sigma-Aldrich) in water was filtered
using the Phenomenex (California, United States) syringe filter tool
(0.45 μm) and diluted to 1 mg/mL in mobile phase. For the DI-ESI-MS
experiments, 0.5 mL of 3.5 mg/mL myoglobin in water was added to 5.0
mL of mobile phase solution yielding a final concentration of 20 μM
(0.32 mg/mL). Carbonic anhydrase and cytochrome C (20 μM) were
prepared similarly from 15 mg/mL stock solutions. For the SEC-UV-MS
experiments, the gel-filtration standard protein mixture was used.
The solution was prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Shortly, the proteins were rehydrated with deionized water and gently
swirled. The final myoglobin concentration in this mixture was 0.5
mg/mL. For additional measurements, 1 mg/mL solutions of carbonic
anhydrase and cytochrome C were prepared by diluting the stock solutions
in mobile phase.

Chromatographic System
A Shimadzu
SIL-20AD Prominence
Ultra-Fast Liquid Chromatography (UFLC) system (‘s-Hertogenbosch,
The Netherlands) equipped with a pump, autosampler, column oven, and
UV absorbance detector set at 280 nm was used for all SEC measurements.
An injection volume of 20 μL, an eluent flow rate of 0.8 mL/min,
a column oven temperature of 25 °C, and an autosampler temperature
of 8 °C were used throughout the study. A TOSOH TSKgel G2000SWXL
column (Griesheim, Germany; 7.8 mm i.d. × 30 cm, 5 μm particle
size, 125 Å pore size; Column 1) was used for the separations.
It was preceded by a TSKgel SWXL Type Guard Column (6 mm i.d. ×
4 cm, 7 μm particle size, 125 Å pore size). Additional
experiments were performed using the Agilent AdvanceBioSEC column
(Wilmington, DE, USA; 2.7 μm, 150 × 4.6 mm, 300 Å;
Column 2) and AdvanceBioSEC guard column (2.7 μm, 50 ×
4.6 mm, 250 Å). The AdvanceBioSEC column was operated with an
injection volume of 5 uL and a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. Both columns
were tested according to the manufacturer’s standard method
using thyroglobulin (from bovine; MW, 670 kDa; pI, 4.5), albumin from
bovine serum (MW, 66 kDa; pI 4.7), myoglobin (from horse; MW, 17 kDa;
pI, 7.2 (major component) and 6.8 (minor component)), and uracil as
a calibration standard; an example is provided in Figure S1. For the mobile phase eluents, stock solutions of
0.2 M of every ammonium salt were prepared and consecutively diluted
to the desired concentration (i.e., 0.01–0.1 M). All eluents
were prepared using ultrapure water and filtered over Whatman (Maidstone,
United Kingdom) regenerated cellulose membrane filters (0.45 μm).
Adjustment of the solution’s pH was performed after filtration.
The pH of the mobile phase was checked using a EL 20 pH meter of Mettler
Toledo (Ohio, United States) at 25 °C. Equilibration of the column
with the respective mobile phase was performed for at least five column
volumes prior to protein injection.

Mass Spectrometry
A micrOTOF-Q (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen,
Germany) with an ESI source operating in positive ion mode was used.
DI-ESI-MS experiments were performed at a flow rate of 180 μL/h
using a 0.5 mL gastight syringe (Hamilton, Reno, USA) and a syringe
pump (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hill, USA). For the coupling of the TOSOH
TSKgel G2000SWXL SEC column and ESI-MS, a flow splitter (1:50; Agilent
Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) was used in order to ensure a flow
of 16 μL/min was directed toward the mass spectrometer, while
the residual flow was guided toward the UV absorbance detector. For
coupling of the AdvanceBioSEC column with ESI-MS, a homemade 1:10
flow splitter was used. The specific configurations were used to prevent
contamination of the source, since sensitivity was not compromised.
The ESI settings were as follows: source temperature, 200 °C;
capillary voltage, 4.8 kV; dry gas flow, 4 L/min; nebulizer gas, 0.4
bar; ion energy, 5 eV; collision energy, 10 eV; in-source collision-induced
dissociation, 0 eV. Ion funnels were set at values of 300 and 400
Vpp, respectively. Mass spectra were acquired in the range of 100
to 5000 m/z. Data analysis was performed
using Bruker Compass DataAnalysis Version 5.0 (Bruker Daltonics).

Data Evaluation
SEC distribution coefficients (Kd) were calculated using eq 1, where V0 and Vi are the void volume and intraparticle volume,
respectively, as obtained from the most recently established calibration
curve, and Vr is the elution volume of
the protein of interest. 1  For the estimation of the fraction of folded
myoglobin based on the DI-ESI-MS and SEC-ESI-MS experiments, data
evaluation was performed with an in-house developed script in Matlab
version 2015b (MathWorks, Massachusetts, United States). Details are
in the Supporting Information. Shortly,
data is obtained within the 750–2500 m/z range, i.e., covering the myoglobin charge state distribution
(CSD). A structurally folded protein with increased compactness of
the polypeptide chain has proven to result in lower charge states,
and it is considered to be a native-like component.41 Therefore, myoglobin signals below m/z 1700 were regarded as to originate from unfolded protein,
whereas signals above m/z 1700 were
treated as caused by folded protein (native).33,35,36,39−41 The fraction folded (or native) was calculated taking the sum of
the intensity (I) of the [M + 8H]8+, [M
+ 9H]9+, and [M + 10H]10+ ions from the CSD
and dividing it by the total intensity (Itot) of all charge states (excluding the signal of the heme group at m/z 616), as described in eq 2. It is important to note that the
obtained charge states might depend on the used instrumentation, as
the geometry of the ESI source can have an impact. 2  To compare between the
DI-ESI-MS and SEC-ESI-MS
experiments using the two columns, the average charge state (CS) of
each of the three proteins was calculated. The CS was calculated based
on the intensity of any given charge state (i) multiplied
by the net charge of the specific charge state (qi), divided by the sum of the signal intensities. 3  

Results and Discussion
This work aims to evaluate possible structural alterations imposed
on proteins during SEC analysis while using eluents of varying composition
(nature of salt), pH, and ionic strength. Native ESI-MS was used as
tool to detect structural changes by means of unfolding. Mobile phase
effects were studied using SEC and ESI-MS individually and in combination
(SEC-ESI-MS), providing a comprehensive picture on the influence of
the different parameters. As a test protein that is prone to structural
changes during analysis, myoglobin was selected, as it readily undergoes
conformational changes when stressed.33,35−37 Since diol-modified silica columns are still predominantly used
for SEC of proteins,21 the majority of
the research has been performed on such a column.

SEC Elution Behavior of
Myoglobin Using Different Mobile Phase
Compositions
In order to investigate protein elution behavior
in aqueous SEC, myoglobin was analyzed using eluents containing four
different additives and varying in pH and ionic strength (Figure 1). First, experiments
were done using a phosphate-based mobile phase containing sodium sulfate
and sodium azide, as this is a standard eluent in aqueous protein
SEC. The chromatograms obtained at low and high ionic strength of
the eluent (Figure 1A) indicate that the elution volume of the protein depends on the
ionic strength. In order to obtain a more comprehensive picture, the
distribution coefficient (Kd; eq 1) of myoglobin was plotted
against the ionic strength for several eluents of different pH (Figure 1B).34 Monitoring changes of the Kd value under varying pH and ionic-strength conditions can provide
insights on the nature of the interactions between the analyte and
stationary phase. Focusing on the phosphate eluent, at lower-ionic-strength
conditions (<0.1 M), the Kd curves
of the examined pH values do not align, which suggests that both size-exclusion
and sorption mechanisms are contributing to the separation. Under
these nonideal SEC conditions, also a pH dependency was observed.
Using an eluent of pH 5.9, which is below the pI of myoglobin (i.e.,
7.242), later elution and higher Kd values were obtained. This indicates electrostatic
interactions between the positively charged protein and deprotonated
silanol groups of the stationary phase. In contrast, at the higher
eluent pH of 7.5, earlier elution and lower Kd values were observed, as a result of exclusion of the overall
negatively charged protein from the negatively charged stationary
phase. Above 0.1 M ionic strength, the Kd lines merge, indicating that the elution volume of myoglobin is
not affected by ionic strength nor by pH of the mobile phase, suggesting
virtually interaction-free SEC.

Figure 1 SEC-UV of myoglobin using different eluents
varying in nature of
salt, ionic strength, and pH. (A) Typical chromatograms obtained with
eluents of low and high ionic strength, all at pH 7.5. (B) Plots representing
the Kd observed for myoglobin versus the
eluent ionic strength using the indicated salt. Eluent pH: 5.9 (black),
6.9 (red), and 7.5 (blue). The connecting lines between the points
highlight trends and are not obtained by fitting.

Subsequently, eluents containing the MS-compatible salts ammonium
acetate, formate, or bicarbonate were studied. Although the ammonium
acetate and formate solutions do not buffer in the examined pH range
(5.9–7.5), they are widely used in SEC-MS. The same pH values
as for phosphate eluent were tested, whereas the ionic strength of
the ammonium salts was selected to be lower to ensure MS compatibility.
Myoglobin analyzed using ammonium acetate as eluent showed similar
elution behavior as then analyzed using the phosphate eluent. Below
0.1 M ionic strength, protein elution was affected by electrostatic
interactions (repulsion or attraction), as revealed from the shift
of the Kd values. A different behavior
was observed when myoglobin was analyzed with the other two volatile
eluents. The high Kd values obtained for
myoglobin using ammonium formate indicate that in this situation electrostatic
interactions are more pronounced at lower ionic strength as compared
to the phosphate and acetate eluent. Ammonium bicarbonate showed the
most apparent deviation of the elution behavior of myoglobin. This
can be explained by the decomposition of bicarbonate into carbon dioxide
at lower pH values.37,38 This instability of the buffer
and the corresponding bubble formation were also limiting factors
for conducting useful experiments at pH 5.9 and 6.9.

The chromatograms
obtained for myoglobin indicate that not only
the retention time but also the peak shape were affected by the applied
eluent conditions (Figure 1A). With eluents containing phosphate and acetate, the myoglobin
peak remained fairly symmetrical when the ionic strength was varied.
However, the formate and bicarbonate eluents caused significant broadening
and tailing of the myoglobin peak at lower ionic strengths (Figure S2). This can be explained by the nonspecific
interactions between the protein and the silica-based stationary phase.23 Moreover, the protein peak area overall was
lower at lower ionic strength, which might be caused by a loss of
protein due to irreversible adsorption to the column material.18,23 The minimum ionic strength needed to effectively avoid unwanted
interactions increased in the order of acetate, formate, and bicarbonate.
By comparing the actual chromatograms for myoglobin and the derived Kd plots, it can be concluded that the ammonium
acetate eluent performs most similar to the phosphate-based eluent,
whereas the mobile phases containing ammonium formate or bicarbonate
deviate, especially at lower-ionic-strength conditions. Interestingly,
this observation seems to follow the Hofmeister series for anions.
Phosphate and acetate are considered as to be kosmotropic anions (i.e.,
stabilizing protein structures), whereas formate and bicarbonate are
more chaotropic anions (i.e., destabilizing protein structures). Although
the underlying mechanisms of the Hofmeister effects are not fully
understood,43 destabilization of protein
structure by the eluent—thereby exposing more amino acid residues—can
explain the increased likelihood of interactions with the column material

SEC Elution Behavior of Other Proteins
In order to
evaluate whether the observations made for myoglobin also hold for
other proteins, a mixture of proteins of different pI values and molecular
weights was analyzed by SEC-UV. Four different eluents at low (0.01
M) and high (0.2 M) ionic strength and at pH values close to the physiological
conditions (pH 6.9, 7.5) were selected (Figure 2). At low ionic strength, electrostatic interactions
are not sufficiently suppressed, leading to peak distortion, and certain
proteins were not even detected (Figure 2A). Only at high ionic strength, apparent
interaction-free SEC separations were achieved for all proteins (Figure 2B). At high ionic
strength, the elution behavior of the largest protein (thyroglobulin;
MW, 670 kDa) is quite similar for all eluents, but that is most probably
due to its elution close to the exclusion limit of the column. For
the other proteins (γ-globulin, ovalbumin, and myoglobin) the
elution volume depends on the eluent salt used. In the presence of
kosmotropic anions, like acetate and phosphate, proteins remain folded,
leaving the protein hydrodynamic radius unchanged. In contrast, the
chaotropic bicarbonate and formate ions destabilize the protein structure,
resulting in a larger hydrodynamic radius and, consequently, shorter
elution times. Note that the difference between the potassium eluent
and ammonium salts can also be attributed in part to the ability of
potassium to more effectively shield the silica gel material.23,44

Figure 2 SEC-UV
of the protein test mixture containing thyroglobulin (1),
γ-globulin (2), ovalbumin (3), myoglobin (4), and vitamin B12
(5) using eluents consisting of solutions of (a) sodium phosphate,
pH 6.9, (b) ammonium acetate, pH 6.9, (c) ammonium formate, pH 7.5,
and (d) ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5 at concentrations of (A) 0.01
M and (B) 0.2 M.

The SEC-UV experiments
reveal a protein elution behavior that depends
on both ionic strength and nature of the eluent. The proteins seem
to undergo structural changes related to the elution conditions and
interactions with the stationary phase, leading to shifts in elution
volumes. In order to confirm the conformational changes, native MS
experiments were carried out.

Direct-Infusion ESI-MS
of Myoglobin
Native ESI-MS in
principle is an excellent tool to probe protein structural alterations.14 Direct-infusion (DI)-ESI-MS of myoglobin was
performed using different aqueous solvents. The protein was dissolved
in ammonium acetate, formate, and bicarbonate solutions of varying
concentrations (0.01–0.2 M) and pH (5.9, 6.9, and 7.5), allowing
correlations with the obtained SEC data.

The mass spectra of
myoglobin obtained using 0.01 and 0.2 M ionic strength at pH 6.9 are
presented in Figure 3. When dissolved in ammonium acetate, myoglobin showed three intense
signals between m/z 1900 and 2500,
which were assigned to its [M + 10H]10+, [M + 9H]9+, and [M + 8H]8+ charge states. The observed monomodal
charge state distribution (CSD) is considered to correspond with the
native/nondenatured conformation of myoglobin.33,35,36,39−41 When comparing the mass spectra obtained for myoglobin dissolved
in acetate, formate, and bicarbonate, clearly different profiles were
observed. For the latter two eluent salts, at higher concentrations,
a second CSD between m/z 600–1700
was observed in the respective mass spectra. Additionally, the signal
at m/z 616 present in the spectrum
obtained with a high concentration of ammonium bicarbonate suggests
also loss of the heme group. The loss of the heme group (m/z 616)36 and the appearance
of higher charge states indicate that myoglobin was partly denatured
when dissolved in 0.2 M ammonium formate or bicarbonate. Deconvolution
of these mass spectra indeed yielded the molecular masses of both
intact myoglobin and myoglobin without the heme group (data not shown).
The deconvoluted mass spectra of myoglobin dissolved in ammonium acetate
solutions only showed the intact myoglobin.

Figure 3 Mass spectra obtained
during DI-ESI-MS of myoglobin dissolved in
0.01 M (A) or 0.2 M (B) ammonium acetate, ammonium formate, or ammonium
bicarbonate (all pH 6.9).

In order to get a more quantitative insight in the myoglobin structure
under the various eluent conditions (nature of salt, ionic strength,
and pH), the fraction of native protein was calculated from the obtained
mass data (eq 2, Materials and Methods). The summed intensities of
the 8+, 9+, and 10+ charge states (representing native myoglobin)
were expressed as a fraction of the total intensity of all observed
charge states for myoglobin, assuming that the native and denatured
forms have equal ionization efficiencies.37 The fraction native was plotted for each tested eluent salt and
pH against the ionic strength (Figure 4). What becomes immediately clear is that ammonium
acetate does not cause any protein denaturation (Figure 4A), regardless of the pH and
ionic strength of the solvent. This is nicely in line with the SEC-UV
results obtained when using ammonium acetate at high ionic strength: Kd and peak width and shape were virtually constant
for each pH tested. When dissolved in ammonium formate and bicarbonate,
the fraction of native myoglobin rapidly decreases with increasing
ionic strength (Figures 4B,C). This trend is opposite of what was observed with SEC-UV, where
at higher ionic strength, the Kd and peak
width and shape improve rather than deteriorate. This difference in
behavior then has to be explained by gas phase processes.

Figure 4 Fraction folded
of myoglobin as derived from DI-ESI-MS of myoglobin
dissolved in (A) ammonium acetate, (B) ammonium formate, and (C) ammonium
bicarbonate of different ionic strength. Eluent pH: 5.9 (black), 6.9
(red), and 7.5 (blue). The connecting lines between the points highlight
trends and are not obtained by fitting.

Acetate is a kosmotropic ion and stabilizes the protein structure.
The chaotropic ions formate and bicarbonate reduce the protein conformation
stability, partly leading to higher charge states of myoglobin during
the ESI process.37,38,45−48 An additional explanation for the observed difference between ammonium
acetate and formate is related to differences in pKa, being approximately 1 unit lower for formate. As a
consequence, acetate may reduce the acidification of the droplets
during the final stages of shrinkage more than formate.49 This would also explain the clear pH dependency
of unfolding using ammonium formate, with the lower pH values leading
to more pronounced protein denaturation (Figure 4B). When using the ammonium bicarbonate solvent,
significantly more denatured protein is observed, even at low ionic
strength, regardless of the pH (Figure 4C). This can be partly ascribed to the chaotropic nature
of bicarbonate in solution, but additional effects may play a role
here.16,37,38 For example,
the formation of carbon dioxide from bicarbonate during the ESI process
can lead to “foaming” in the produced microdroplets,
resulting in supercharging of the protein, even from solutions with
a pH close to physiological conditions.16,38

Overall,
the DI-ESI-MS results show that using a solution of ammonium
acetate appears to preserve the myoglobin structure quite efficiently,
whereas formate and especially bicarbonate cause much higher fractions
of denatured species. Moreover, it shows that structural alterations
of myoglobin can occur, even under what are normally considered to
be native conditions.

SEC-ESI-MS of Myoglobin
Online SEC-ESI-MS
experiments
were performed in order to verify whether potential structural alterations
induced by the applied SEC conditions can be probed by ESI-MS and
subsequently explain the obtained SEC-UV results. The protein test
mixture was analyzed using eluents containing ammonium acetate, formate,
or bicarbonate at 0.01 and 0.2 M ionic strength with a pH of 6.9 or
7.5. Figure 5 shows
the obtained chromatograms and average mass spectra from the myoglobin
peak when using the ammonium acetate eluent. The results for ammonium
formate and bicarbonate can be found in Figure S3 of the SI.

Figure 5 SEC-ESI-MS of the protein test mixture using
an eluent of (A) 0.01
M ammonium acetate and (B) 0.2 M ammonium acetate (both pH 6.9). Average
mass spectra of the myoglobin peaks are provided. Peaks: thyroglobulin
(1), γ-globulin (2), ovalbumin (3), myoglobin (4), and vitamin
B12 (5).

As can be expected, the elution
behavior of myoglobin during SEC-ESI-MS
analysis is similar to that observed using SEC-UV. However, the mass
spectra of myoglobin obtained with SEC-ESI-MS clearly differ from
the mass spectra obtained with DI-ESI-MS using the same eluent conditions.
When using 0.01 M ammonium acetate and formate, only myoglobin in
its native form was observed (CSD in m/z 1700–2500 range) with DI-ESI-MS. Remarkably, the mass spectra
obtained during SEC-ESI-MS using the same eluent (Figure 5A) indicated a significant
presence of denatured myoglobin (CSD between m/z 600 and 1700). For all tested eluent conditions, the fraction
native myoglobin was calculated when using SEC-ESI-MS and compared
to the fraction values obtained with DI-ESI-MS (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Fraction folded of myoglobin calculated after
analysis by (A) DI-ESI-MS
and (B) SEC-ESI-MS using different eluents of low (0.01 M) and high
(0.2 M) ionic strength. Eluents: ammonium acetate (light blue), ammonium
formate (orange), and ammonium bicarbonate (dark blue).

The effect of ionic strength appeared to be opposite for
the two
analytical setups: whereas when using DI-ESI-MS a increasing ionic
strength leads to a higher degree of denaturation, when using SEC-ESI-MS,
a decreasing ionic strength leads to more protein denaturation. Notably,
for both analytical systems, the measured fraction of folded protein
at high ionic strength is similar. Hence, the effect of difference
between the setups should be contributed to the lower ionic strength.
In order to verify this observation, additional DI-ESI-MS experiments
were performed. Initially with DI-ESI-MS, the incubation time of the
protein in buffer was only a few minutes. Extending the incubation
time to 30 min (i.e., the SEC analysis time), the protein mass spectrum
did not change (data not shown), excluding exposure to the buffer
as cause of denaturation. Consequently, also in light of the peak
tailing of the myoglobin peak and the loss of other proteins during
SEC analysis, it seems most plausible that the nonspecific interactions
between the protein and the stationary phase at low salt concentration
are the cause of this effect. Although extensive equilibration of
the column with the respective mobile phases was performed, residual
silanols might still give rise to protein denaturation. As is known
from many fields, proteins can easily adsorb onto a (silica) surface.18,34,50−53 During this process, the electrostatic
interactions, hydrogen-bonding, dipole–dipole van der Waals
interactions, and hydrophobic effects between the silica and the protein
can result in a conformational change of the latter. This suggests
that ESI-MS can be used as a read out of the actual structure of the
protein after separation. Consequently, this then would also allow
monitoring of the effect of the SEC stationary phase/elution process
on protein conformation.

To investigate this further, the fraction
of folded protein over
the peak as obtained with both 0.01 and 0.2 M ammonium acetate was
plotted (Figure S4). Using 0.2 M ammonium
acetate as an eluent results in a stable folded protein fraction between
0.95 and 1.0 over the whole peak elution window. However, when using
the 0.010 M eluent, a clear trend is observed. At the beginning, the
fraction folded is approximately 0.5, and it drops to about 0.25 in
the tail of the elution window. Indeed, it seems plausible that stronger
interaction/adsorption between the protein and column material leads
to a higher degree of irreversible denaturation for part of the protein
molecules. This process is reduced when using a higher ionic strength,54 as is evident from the preservation of the native
protein structure and the lack of any trend throughout the peak profile.

Confirmatory SEC-ESI-MS Experiments
To further study
the described effects related to nonspecific interactions, additional
proteins were analyzed by SEC-ESI-MS. Both an acidic protein (carbonic
anhydrase; CA, pI 5.4) and basic protein (cytochrome C; CC, pI 10.8)
were selected for this purpose. They were analyzed using the diol
column in combination with ammonium acetate eluents of varying concentrations
(0.01, 0.05, and 0.2 M) at pH 6.9. If no on-column interactions take
place, these eluents should preserve the protein’s structure
in liquid and gas phase. The chromatographic results are shown in Figure S5A. The expected Kd values—based on the calibration curve—were
obtained when using the high-ionic-strength (0.2 M) eluent. Lowering
the ionic strength makes the previously described protein pI/eluent
pH effects become evident. For CA, the elution volume decreases (exclusion),
whereas for CC, it increases (electrostatic interactions). The interactions
for CC additionally lead to significant peak tailing and at the lowest
ionic strength (0.01 M) even result in a full loss of the protein
peak. The mass spectra obtained for the two proteins also show a clear
trend (Figure S5C). Lowering the ionic
strength leads to an increase in average CS (Figure S5E,F). This is in contrast to their CS as obtained with DI-ESI-MS,
which remains independent of ionic strength. Hence, the difference
between the two experiments must result from stress that the protein
experiences when going through the column under low-ionic-strength
conditions and is thus effectively shielded at high ionic strength.
Denaturation, as observed for myoglobin, was not evident for both
proteins. Indeed, exclusion as observed for carbonic anhydrase does
not lead to protein–column interaction, and it is reasonable
to assume this then does not lead to denaturation. Moreover, for CC,
the interactions between the protein and the column were so strong
that the protein did not elute and the effect could not be visualized.
Apparently, the interactions were limited at 0.05 M and did not lead
to full denaturation.

Although diol-based columns are the standard
in protein analysis by SEC, improved chemistries have recently been
introduced. Therefore, all the three proteins have been analyzed using
a SEC column modified with a proprietary hydrophilic chemistry aiming
to minimize nonspecific interactions. For CA and CC, a similar trend
was found in terms of chromatographic behavior for the proteins; CA
experiences exclusion from the pores, whereas CC shows interaction
upon ionic-strength decrease (Figure S5B). Interestingly though, especially the electrostatic interaction
was reduced to a degree that CC even eluted under the lowest-ionic-strength
conditions. The resulting mass spectra show an increase in average
CS when the ionic strength is reduced (Figure S5D–F), but the effect is less pronounced compared to
when the proteins were analyzed on the diol column. Obviously, myoglobin
was also analyzed using this column. Similar to the two other proteins,
the chromatographic behavior was improved compared to the diol column.
Especially at the lowest ionic strength, the peak position and shape
indicate a significant decrease in protein–column interaction
(Figure S6A). Interestingly, as a consequence
of this, also no protein denaturation but an increase in CS in the
native area of the mass spectrum was observed (Figure S6B). So, it seems that even when interactions are
limited, SEC-ESI-MS can still give insights into these unwanted effects
based on subtle differences in protein elution profile and average
CS.

Conclusion
We investigated the influence of SEC conditions
on protein structural
integrity using native ESI-MS as a selective tool to reveal conformational
alterations. The SEC elution and ESI using eluents of several volatile
salts of varying ionic strength and pH were examined using the model
hemoprotein myoglobin. Results indicate that high-ionic-strength conditions
of volatile salts ensure almost interaction-free aqueous SEC under
near-physiological pH conditions. Lower ionic strength does not prevent
(electrostatic) interactions between the column material and protein,
leading to severe adsorption and peak tailing. Variations in the elution
behavior of proteins mainly seem to correlate with the kosmotropic/chaotropic
nature of the cationic salt additives. The impact of pH and ionic
strength in the elution profile are strongly influenced by the physical–chemical
properties of the protein as well as the stationary phase material.
Therefore, they should be thoroughly assessed on an individual basis.
Native ESI-MS revealed critical differences between the ammonium salts
regarding their impact on protein denaturation under the examined
conditions. Ammonium acetate most effectively preserved the protein
structure regardless of ionic strength and pH conditions, whereas
formate and especially bicarbonate cause much higher fractions of
the denatured species. Coupling of SEC with native ESI-MS enabled
monitoring of structural changes during the elution process. Overall,
we conclude that the introduction of ESI-MS can reveal the influence
of nonspecific interactions between protein and stationary phase on
the protein structure. A next, highly relevant, step will be to study
large proteins/biopharmaceuticals and protein complexes in order to
gain more insights as to whether this platform can be used to monitor
structural changes in both liquid and gas phase.
