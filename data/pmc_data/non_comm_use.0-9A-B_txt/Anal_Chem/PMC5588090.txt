Electrospray
ionization (ESI) is widely used in liquid chromatography
coupled to mass spectrometry (LC–MS) for the analysis of biomolecules.
However, the ESI process is still not completely understood, and it
is often a matter of trial and error to enhance ESI efficiency and,
hence, the response of a given set of compounds. In this work we performed
a systematic study of the ESI response of 14 amino acids that were
acylated with organic acid anhydrides of increasing chain length and
with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) changing certain physicochemical
properties in a predictable manner. By comparing the ESI response
of 70 derivatives, we found that there was a strong correlation between
the calculated molecular volume and the ESI response, while correlation
with hydrophobicity (log P values), pKa, and the inverse calculated surface tension was significantly
lower although still present, especially for individual derivatized
amino acids with increasing acyl chain lengths. Acylation with PEG
containing five ethylene glycol units led to the largest gain in ESI
response. This response was maximal independent of the calculated
physicochemical properties or the type of amino acid. Since no actual
physicochemical data is available for most derivatized compounds,
the responses were also used as input for a quantitative structure–property
relationship (QSPR) model to find the best physicochemical descriptors
relating to the ESI response from molecular structures using the amino
acids and their derivatives as a reference set. A topological descriptor
related to molecular size (SPAN) was isolated next to a descriptor
related to the atomic composition and structural groups (BIC0). The
validity of the model was checked with a test set of 43 additional
compounds that were unrelated to amino acids. While prediction was
generally good (R2 > 0.9), compounds
containing
halogen atoms or nitro groups gave a lower predicted ESI response.

==== Body
Electrospray
ionization (ESI)
is the most commonly used ionization technique in combination with
liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) for
the identification and quantification of a large variety of compounds
in a wide range of areas (e.g., biochemical, environmental, and food
analysis). Sensitivity of mass spectrometers has improved over the
last decades due to better ion transmission using new features like
ion funnels, orthogonal spray sources, and/or simply a bigger orifice
diameter in combination with more powerful vacuum pumps. Further enhancements
were realized by reducing LC flow rates down to nanoflow conditions
where electrospray ionization efficiency is greatly improved.1,2 Nevertheless, ESI-MS responses can differ by many orders of magnitude
for a set of compounds while measured under the same conditions.3 Thus, many researches have tried to understand
the underlying reasons, finally leading to the postulation of four
theoretical models that assist in understanding ESI response differences:
the charge residual model (CRM),4 the ion
evaporation model (IEM),5 the equilibrium
partition model (EPM),6 and the chain ejection
model (CEM).7 In general, during ESI a
liquid flow is led through a needle to which a voltage of 2–3
kV is applied, resulting in charged droplets and producing ionized
molecules due to charge-transfer reactions. Next to this, a drying
gas leads to solvent evaporation and the subsequent reduction in initial
droplet diameter. The CRM, first proposed by Dole et al.,4 postulates that charge is concentrated on the
droplet surface where it can be transferred to neutral or already
charged molecules. According to this theory, the charged droplet leaving
the needle will form a so-called Taylor cone followed by a fine stream
(jet) of tiny droplets depending on the drying gas flow and temperature,
the solvent/solution surface tension, and conductivity. As solvent
continues to evaporate, charged droplets continue to decrease in size
concentrating the charged molecules until a critical point (the Rayleigh
limit) is reached. At this point, the repulsive power of all concentrated
ions of the same charge results in an explosion of the droplet into
many smaller droplets, also known as Coulomb fission and visualized
by Duft et al.8 This process repeats itself
until there is no solvent left and all molecules are evaporated into
the gas phase. This theory is thought to be most valid for large molecules
like intact/unfolded proteins.9 For small
ions the IEM proposed by Iribarne and Thomson5 is more generally accepted. In this model ions evaporate into the
gas phase during the solvent evaporation process due to repulsion
between ions of the same charge as soon as the droplets are sufficiently
small (<10 nm). This phenomenon reduces and even replaces the fission
process described by the CRM, since the evaporation rate of ions becomes
faster than the evaporation rate of solvent, preventing droplets to
reach the Rayleigh limit.5 It is likely
that both processes coexist in many cases. The EPM considers equilibrium
between ions in the droplet interior and on the charged surface explaining
the often better responses for surface-active compounds. The CEM,
recently postulated by Konerman et al.7 as a fourth mechanism, implies that large multiply charged polymers
and denatured (unfolded) proteins are present near the charged droplet
surface due to their hydrophobic character. Consequently, they are
pulled out of the droplet by repulsive electrostatic forces while
acquiring charge from the droplet prior to droplet fission. A recent
review about ESI processes by Banerjee and Mazumdar gives an overview
of the current theories.10

Although
the formation of ions with electrospray is still not fully
understood, the models described above indicate parameters that might
influence the electrospray response. These can be distinguished in
instrumental, solution, and compound-related parameters or properties.
Differences in ionization efficiency between instruments are mainly
due to the design, which cannot be influenced by the user and, once
chosen, is fixed. The effect of solution conditions mainly relates
to solvents and their additives like formic acid or ammonia as well
as to the composition of the sample matrix, affecting parameters like
pH, surface tension, and ionic strength. A complex sample matrix may
cause suppression of the ESI response due to a competition for charge
between the different substances in solution near the limited droplet
surface, a well-known disadvantage of this technique.11,12 Suppression can often be reduced by sample cleanup and/or a liquid
chromatographic separation.13 Another response-affecting
phenomenon often seen with ESI and related to the choice of solvent/additive,
is adduct formation (e.g., Na+, K+, and NH4+) which may coexist next to protonated ions. The
formation of adducts is highly component-, matrix-, as well as instrument-related
but can often be reduced by spraying under acidic conditions using
additives like formic or acetic acid or their ammonium salts14 or masked using metal-chelating additives.15 Nonetheless, adduct formation is often difficult
to avoid. As adducts are also ions originating from the compounds
under investigation, they should be accounted for in ESI efficiency
calculations. Identical arguments hold with respect to the presence
of dimers (2M + H/Na) and in-source fragments, which can coexist with
adducts. The former may occur especially for compounds having a good
ESI response at concentrations >10 μM due to ion-saturated
droplet
surfaces,12,16 while the latter mostly indicate nonoptimal
source parameters.

Finally, the ESI response may be affected
by solution- and compound-related
physicochemical properties like surface tension/activity, conductivity,
hydrophobicity (log P), ionizability (pKa), and molecular volume. Numerous articles have focused
on ESI response enhancements due to different solvent compositions
and with different additives,17−19 or by changing the physicochemical
properties of compounds through derivatization,20−23 or using peptides differing in
only one amino acid residue,24 while others
tried to find ESI response relations from a diverse set of compounds
with orders of magnitude response differences at fixed instrumental
conditions.3 Here we focus on a fixed set
of amino acids that overall are not very responsive to ESI and study
the response enhancement after derivatization in order to change compound
properties in a systematic manner. We used acylation with acid anhydrides
of increasing hydrophobicity as well as with poly(ethylene glycol)
(PEG) based on previous work21 and investigated
the relation between response and a number of physicochemical parameters.
As these experiments were performed by reversed-phase LC–MS
(RPLC–MS), the effect of solvent composition on the response
was investigated first using flow injection analysis (FIA) of individually
labeled amino acids.

Since finding relevant relationships between
the electrospray response
and physicochemical parameters may be hampered by a lack of reported
data, in particular for the derivatives, we developed a quantitative
structure–property relationship (QSPR)25,26 model to elucidate descriptors and finally to predict electrospray
ionization efficiencies from molecular structures.

Experimental
Section
Reagents and Materials
Solutions (100 mM) of each
of the 20 natural amino acids histidine (H), lysine (K), asparagine
(N), arginine (R), aspartic acid (D), serine (S), glutamine (Q), glycine
(G), threonine (T), glutamic acid (E), alanine (A), proline (P), cysteine
(C), tyrosine (Y), methionine (M), valine (V), isoleucine (I), leucine
(L), phenylalanine (F), and tryptophan (W) (Sigma; Zwijndrecht, The
Netherlands) were prepared in 0.1 M sodium hydroxide (Sigma; Zwijndrecht,
The Netherlands) and stored at −20 °C. C and N were prepared
at 50 mM, D, E, and W at 10, and Y at 1 mM due to limited solubility.
These standards were diluted further individually as well as in a
mixture to a final concentration of 50 μM in 0.1 M sodium phosphate
buffer, pH 8.

The 50 mM solutions of aniline, p-toluidine, 4-chloroaniline, 4-nitroaniline, cyclohexylamine, 4-aminobenzoic
acid, 2-amino-5-bromobenzoic acid, and l-(+)-α-phenylglycine
(all Sigma; Zwijndrecht) were prepared in 0.1 M sodium hydroxide and
further diluted to 50 μM in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH
8. Individual solutions as well as a mixture including A, H, and W
were stored at −20 °C until use.

Labeling Procedure
Amounts of 100 μL of the 50
μM mixtures were labeled with 1 μmol of the 13C1-pentafluorophenyl-activated ester of a poly(ethylene
glycol) derivative (PEG-OPFP, synthesized as described in Abello et
al.21) containing five ethylene glycol
units or with 20, 15, 12, and 9 μmol (2 μL each) of acetic,
propionic, butyric, or hexanoic acid anhydride (Sigma; Zwijndrecht,
The Netherlands), respectively, for 15 min in a thermomixer (Eppendorf;
Hamburg, Germany) at 450 rpm and 25 °C. Esterification of the
phenolic OH group of Y was reversed by incubating the sample for 15
min at 99 °C with vortexing (450 rpm). Finally, formic acid (Merck
KGaA; Darmstadt, Germany) was added to the samples to a final concentration
of 1% (v/v) prior to analysis by LC–MS. The nonderivatized
compounds were injected individually to avoid ionization suppression.

Instrumental Parameters
The HPLC part of the analytical
system consisted of an Agilent series 1100 capillary LC system (Waldbronn,
Germany) comprising a degasser, a binary pump with stream splitter
and flow controller (50 μL/min), a thermostated autosampler
(4 °C), and a thermostated column compartment (40 °C). Compounds
were chromatographically separated with an Atlantis dC18 column (Waters;
Etten-Leur, The Netherlands; 1.0 mm × 150 mm, particle size 3
μm). Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in ultrapure
water. Mobile phase B was 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile (HPLC-S
gradient grade; Biosolve; Valkenswaard, The Netherlands). Injection
volume was 1 μL. The separation was performed starting at 2%
B and a gradient of 0.5% B/min starting right after injection up to
37% B followed by a 2 min gradient to 90% B to regenerate the column
for 8 min before going back to 2% B in 2 min and an 8 min final conditioning
step.

Analytes were measured in a Bruker HCT ion trap mass spectrometer
(Bruker Daltonik GmbH; Bremen, Germany) equipped with an ESI source
operated in positive mode. MS data were acquired over a mass-to-charge
(m/z) scan range of 100–700
or 52–700 in single-MS mode for the labeled and nonlabeled
components, respectively. Skimmer voltage was set to 30. Capillary
exit and trap drive settings were adjusted by the smart parameter
settings (SPS) using m/z 150, 200,
and 350 as average optimum for non-, acyl-, and PEG-labeled compounds,
respectively. The nebulizer and drying gas flows were set to 20 and
7 L/min, respectively, using a source temperature of 250 °C.
Extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) were retrieved with a tolerance
of ±0.5 Da. To compensate for day-to-day variations, all ESI
responses to be used in the QSPR model were normalized to the response
of butanoylated W measured in the same series using peak areas.

Fractionation and Flow Injection
Fractionation of PEG-labeled
amino acids was performed manually employing the LC method described
above but injecting 10 μL. Up to 15 50 μL fractions were
collected, evaporated until dryness using a Concentrator 5301 at 30
°C (Eppendorf; Hamburg, Germany), and reconstituted in 100 μL
of 20% acetonitrile (HPLC-S gradient grade; Biosolve; Valkenswaard,
The Netherlands). Due to the noncomplete LC separation some of the
fractions contained more than one PEG-labeled amino acid. Flow injection
analysis was implemented on the LC–MS system described above
without the use of a column. In each analysis, five injections of
1 μL of sample were preceded and followed by a 1 μL injection
of a blank (ultrapure water containing 20% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic
acid). The mobile phase consisted of 3%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, or 80%
acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in ultrapure water at a flow
rate of 50 μL/min.

Physicochemical and QSPR Parameters
As most physicochemical
parameters of the derivatives cannot be derived from literature, they
were calculated from molecular structures using the simplified molecular
input line entry system (SMILES). The freely available software tool
Chemicalize (https://chemicalize.com) was used to calculate molecular volumes based on three-dimensional
(3D) structures and van der Waals radii. KOWWIN, included in the EPI
suite (v411, U.S. EPA; Washington, DC, U.S.A.), was used to calculate
log P values using atom/fragment contribution methods.
Marvinsketch (v16.10.3, ChemAxon; Budapest, Hungary) was employed
to calculate pKa values based on physicochemical
parameters obtained from ionization site-specific regression equations.
For commercially produced chemicals many of these parameters were
obtained from the Chemspider Web site (http://www.chemspider.com/),27 which was used to access surface
tensions, as predicted by the Physchem module in the Percepta platform
(ACD/Laboratories; Toronto, ON, Canada), based on molecular weight,
volume, and density. Chemoffice ChemBio3D Ultra 12.0 (PerkinElmer;
Waltham, MA, U.S.A.) was used for 3D molecular structure optimization
needed for descriptor calculations by the Dragon 5.5 software (Talette
SRL; Milan, Italy). After applying a cross-correlation matrix of descriptors
as a primary filter, a fuzzy forward search algorithm was used to
isolate the most relevant descriptors as explained in more detail
in the Supporting Information. This algorithm
was developed using Python 3 in conjunction with the Pandas, Numpy,
Scipy, and Sklearn libraries for mathematic computations (Python Software
Foundation, https://www.python.org/).

Results and Discussion
Effect of Instrumental
Parameters
Instrumental parameters
of the mass spectrometer may have a direct effect on the transmission
of ions and thus on the measured signal. Some of these, like the capillary
exit voltage and the trap drive value, are mass-dependent. The former
affects in-source fragmentation as well as desolvation and declustering,
while the latter is the radio frequency field strength needed for
optimal trapping. Both values are defined by the smart parameter settings
(SPS) for an on average optimal transmission around a specific m/z value. The skimmer voltage affects
transmission as well as in-source fragmentation, the latter being
compound-dependent and not affected by the SPS settings. Varying these
parameters over a range from m/z 76 to 922 resulted in rather Gaussian optimization curves with broad
tops of at least 10 V for the skimmer voltage as well as the capillary
exit voltage, while the trap drive showed optimization curves with
a slightly negative slope (see Supporting Information Figure S-1 for more details). This means that the optima, as defined
by the SPS algorithm, were also valid for ions with m/z values in a window of about ±50% allowing
the use of average SPS settings of m/z 150, 200, and 350 for the non-, acyl-, and PEG-labeled amino acids,
respectively.

The skimmer voltage was set to 30, close to the
individual optima for all compounds. No in-source fragmentation was
observed at this value. In that way transmission efficiency differences
due to differences in m/z values
were always within ±20%, which is negligible with respect to
the orders of magnitude of difference seen after derivatization. This
allowed examining ionization efficiency differences independently
of small effects related to ion transmission from ion source to detector.

Effect of Acetonitrile Concentration
As the solvent
composition is often reported to affect electrospray ionization efficiency
and a solvent gradient is needed for proper separation of compounds
from a mixture using RPLC, we studied the influence of the acetonitrile
concentration on ionization efficiency by FIA of PEG-labeled amino
acids, since they provided the highest gain in sensitivity, showed
high retention, and consequently, should be strongly affected by this
parameter. The mixtures were first fractionated and analyzed as individual
PEG-labeled amino acids, minimizing confounding effects due to ionization
suppression or adduct formation due to buffer components or residual
reagent byproducts as described under the Experimental
Section. Figure 1 shows the total ion chromatogram traces of PEG-labeled amino acids.
As K contains two reactive amino groups, this resulted in the presence
of three products indicated as K′, K*, and K′* for singly
and doubly PEG-labeled K, respectively. Because of these coexisting
products and the coelution of PEG-labeled K* and PEG-labeled Q having
almost the same masses, both amino acids were excluded from further
study. A few additional components had to be excluded from the study
as well for the following reasons. Y was excluded, because O-acylation
was only completely reversed by heating for the PEG-labeled amino
acid but not for acylated Y, C was excluded because of its potential
for oxidation, and D and E because they appeared to be unstable in
the stock solutions at −20 °C.

Figure 1 Total ion chromatogram
of 50 pmol PEG-labeled amino acids.

For this study we collected seven chromatographically well-resolved
PEG-labeled amino acid derivatives (A, P, Y, I, L, F, and W) for FIA,
while others were collected in one fraction (H and K′; N, R
and S; G and D; T and E; V and M; K*, Q, and S). The mass spectra
of most flow-injected PEG-labeled amino acids showed abundant sodium
adducts of up to 50% of the protonated ion for F against less than
5% when using chromatography. Abundant sodium adducts are commonly
observed in ESI mass spectrometry, especially in the absence of chromatography
in front of the mass spectrometer.22 They
occur due to the presence of sodium ions in the sample and/or solvent
or due to a contaminated ion source. We assume that in this case sodium
ions were introduced from the glass vials in the auto sampler prior
to FIA. It is striking that the first seven eluting PEG-labeled amino
acids did not show any sodium adducts upon FIA, while the rest of
the PEG-derivatized amino acids showed a slight increase in sodium
adducts with increasing acetonitrile concentration (see Figure S-2
in Supporting Information). In this work
we included adduct ions when their response contribution was >20%.
In-source fragments were not detected at levels higher than 10% of
the base peak and were therefore disregarded.

The effect of
the acetonitrile concentration on the response of
PEG-labeled amino acids using the combined signals from protonated
and sodium-adduct ions ranged from no influence to a maximum increase
by a factor of 2.5 [see Figure S-3 in Supporting Information for representative traces of PEG-labeled I (strongest
effect), PEG-labeled H (representative effect seen for all PEG-labeled
amino acids) and PEG-labeled S (no effect)]. This appeared also to
be valid when looking at protonated and sodium adduct ions separately.
We conclude that the effect of a changing acetonitrile concentration
during gradient elution on the ESI response is no bigger than 3-fold
even when comparing results at 3% and 80% acetonitrile, respectively.
As all labeled amino acids elute between 7% and 27% acetonitrile,
we estimate that the effect of acetonitrile on the ESI response during
RPLC is a factor of 2 at the most, which is much smaller than the
observed effects due to derivatization.

These results are in
agreement with findings by others, who showed
that there is only a relatively small dependence of the Rayleigh limit
on the type of solvent.9 Comparing ESI
responses after chromatographic separation or FIA at 20% acetonitrile
showed that the ESI response after chromatography is on average 2.5
± 1 times higher (see Figure S-4 in Supporting Information). This is likely due to removal of ionic matrix
components by chromatography leading to less ion suppression. These
comparisons showed that it is justified to compare ESI responses after
separation by gradient RPLC using acetonitrile as organic modifier
and to assume that between compound response differences bigger than
a factor 2 are primarily related to compound properties rather than
solvent properties or m/z-dependent
differences in ion transmission.

Effect of Derivatization
Derivatization of amino acids
with acyl chains of increasing length increases the hydrophobicity
of the resulting derivatives as also indicated by an increased retention
time upon RPLC (see Figure S-5 in the Supporting Information). The PEG-labeled amino acids have lower retention
times than their corresponding C6-labeled counterparts indicating
that they are less hydrophobic.

Figure 2 shows that the response of almost all amino
acids steadily increases with the length of the acyl chain. PEG derivatization
gives the largest response for any amino acid demonstrating that hydrophobicity
alone cannot explain the gain in ESI response. In fact, PEG derivatization
of G increases the ESI response by 3 orders of magnitude. The observed
gain in ESI response for PEG-labeled W of a factor 12 corresponds
well to the previously reported factor 17 by Abello et al.21 using a similar LC–MS system. Not all
results were in line with the expected response gain. H, N, and S
showed a reduced response for the C2 label, which may be attributed
to their low retention and consequently poor separation from the buffer
matrix as well as from each other, leading to ion suppression.

Figure 2 Effect of derivatization
of the amino group with carboxylic acids
with acyl chain lengths ranging from 2 to 6 CH2 groups
in comparison to PEG-labeling with PEG containing 5 (CH2CH2)–O– moieties. Average reproducibility
was 15 ± 6% (n = 3).

As shown above, only response enhancement factors up to 2
can be
explained by the effect of differences in solvent composition across
the applied acetonitrile gradient and retention time of the analytes.
This shows that the observed differences are truly related to the
molecular properties of the derivatized amino acids. It is thus of
interest to gain a better understanding how physicochemical molecular
properties affect the ESI response.

Physicochemical Molecular
Properties Affecting the ESI Response
The existence of at
least 38 different published hydrophobicity
scales for amino acids indicates the complex nature of this parameter
which tries to combine many physicochemical properties in a single
value. Amino acid hydrophobicity scales can roughly be divided into
two classes, one based on the physicochemical properties of the individual
amino acids and the other one based on their characteristics as part
of proteins,28 the latter being of less
relevance to the current work. Hydrophobicity is also often expressed
as the distribution coefficient of a compound between water and n-octanol also known as the log Kow or log P value. Although there is considerable
scattering when looking at the entire data set, correlations between
log P and ESI response become clearer when grouping
the data according to the individual labels (Figure 3) and are even more striking when looking
at individual amino acids (see Figure S-6 in Supporting Information). The correlation with retention time instead of
log P is even stronger, indicating that this parameter
reflects the effect on ESI response better for the current set of
compounds (see Figure S-7 and Table S-2 in Supporting Information). Correlations are comparable with average correlation
coefficients of 0.81 ± 0.11 when the PEG-labeled compounds are
excluded (see Table S-2 in Supporting Information). The retention on a reversed-phase column is known to be strongly
correlated to ESI response29 as well as
log P,30 although structurally
diverse compounds may not always show a clear correlation. Especially
R, H, and G show different patterns compared to the other acyl-labeled
amino acids, notably when plotted against retention time (Figure S-7
in Supporting Information). G has a steeper
slope indicating a major effect of acylation on ESI response. This
may be related to the very low ESI response of nonderivatized G and
the absence of a side chain in this molecule. The higher responses
of R and H prior to acylation may be related to the presence of additional
positively charged nitrogen atoms in their side chains resulting in
a high proton affinity. It is noteworthy that PEG-labeled amino acids
give the highest ESI response independent of their calculated log P value or retention time, forming a separate cluster as
depicted in Figure 3. This indicates that the introduction of a PEG moiety having hydrophobic
as well as hydrophilic properties may be a generic derivatization
approach to enhance the ESI response. This was further studied with
another set of compounds later on.

Figure 3 Electrospray response in relation to the
log P of derivatized amino acids with respect to
the length of the acyl
chain and PEG moiety.

As the compounds used in this study are not volatile, they
will
be concentrated in the droplets during ESI. Compounds with a higher
surface activity are expected to accumulate at the droplet/air interface
resulting in better ionization efficiency.11 Since surface activity is defined as a property that influences
the surface tension of a liquid, the latter may be good indicator
for this parameter, although log P is sometimes also
used to deduce surface activity.31 The
effect of a compound on the surface tension of a liquid can be measured
with the sessile or pendant drop method. This method, which determines
the droplet contact angle on a flat surface between 40° and 90°,
is limited to droplets of more than 20 μL.32 Unfortunately this method failed to register any influence
of the labeled amino acids on surface tension at concentrations up
to 50 μM. We thus resorted to calculations as indicated under
the Experimental Section. There is a weak
negative correlation between the ESI response and the calculated surface
tension for individual amino acids and their derivatives (see Supporting Information Figure S-8, top panel;
surface tension values for the PEG-labeled amino acids are not included
in this figure, as they were unavailable from the Chemspider database)
with considerable scatter. It may also be that effects of the pure
compounds on surface tension
may be of less relevance due to their low concentrations in solution.

A striking feature of our data is that the smallest amino acid
G has the highest and the biggest amino acid W the lowest gain in
response upon derivatization. We therefore plotted the calculated
molecular volume against the measured ESI response and found a strong
correlation (Figure 4). When specified per amino acid, correlations are even stronger
(Figure S-9 and Table S-2, Supporting Information). G has a low ESI response due to its small size and high polarity
and, hence, distributes homogeneously in the ESI droplets. With the
introduction of acyl groups responses increase according to their
length, and hence, their hydrophobicity as the derivatized amino acid
enriches at the charged droplet surface, acquiring charge more easily.

Figure 4 Relation
between the ESI response and the calculated molecular
volume specified for each acyl chain length and PEG moiety.

When plotted against pKa, the non-,
acyl-, and PEG-labeled amino acids form three separate clusters (Figure
S-10, lower panel, Supporting Information). A correlation between pKa and ESI
response,
often reported in the literature,3,31 was observed
for the acyl-labeled amino acids notwithstanding the small pKa window of one unit (Figure S-10 and Table
S-2 Supporting Information). This indicates
a relation between the length of the acyl chain the pKa and the ESI response, especially for individual amino
acids. However, since pKa, hydrophobicity,
surface tension, and molecular volume are all related to each other,
we conclude that molecular volume is most strongly correlated with
the ESI response and that pKa plays only
a minor role. A correlation between pKa value and the ESI response was not observed for PEG-labeled amino
acids and only marginally for the underivatized amino acids.

Since pH can affect the charge state, it is of interest to follow
it during the electrospray process as it may relate to the ionization
efficiency. Zhou et al. used laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy
with and without buffering around pH 7 and concluded that the pH in
ESI droplets decreases by 1 unit at the most during evaporation.33 From an analytical and stochastic modeling point
of view a pH reduction of several units (from pH 4 to pH 1) was predicted
in the presence of a buffering macromolecule like a protein, as deduced
from its maximum charge state.34 Since
all compounds in this study are low molecular weight compounds, a
pH reduction of maximally one unit may be expected during the ESI
process. Solutions containing 0.1% formic acid (pKa = 3.75) have a pH of about 2.7, which is in the pKa range of the carboxylic acid group of most
underivatized amino acids and about 1 unit below the pKa of their derivatives. This means that we are essentially
dealing with neutral molecules (<10% deprotonation of the carboxylic
acid group), in the case of derivatized amino acids, at the acidic
pH of the initial ESI droplets, that need to be charged by protonation/adduct
formation. The nonderivatized amino acids, however, are already protonated
at their amino group under these low-pH conditions, although the low
responses demonstrate that this does not lead to more efficient ESI,
indicating that pH is not a critical parameter in this context.

Since ESI transfers ions to the gas phase, a parameter like proton
affinity, which is related to gas-phase basicity, may give a better
relation to ionization efficiency and response. Proton affinities
are difficult to measure and have only been determined for a limited
number of compounds, among which amino acids but not for their derivatives.
Although some models to predict proton affinity from molecular structure
have been published,35 they are to our
knowledge not publicly available and/or still under development. While
the reported proton affinity difference for nonderivatized G and W
(887 vs 949 kJ/mol according to the NIST Chemistry WebBook36) is in line with their ESI response difference,
this data is too sparse to draw conclusions. Investigations of proton
affinities of amino acid derivatives are needed to link them to the
measured ESI response.

QSPR Results
It would be of great
interest to be able
to predict how structural properties of molecules can be translated
into molecular descriptors that can then be used to model the ESI
response differences. This would allow us to “predict”
how a certain type of derivatization strategy would affect the ESI
response, taking some of the trial and error out of this approach

The measured electrospray responses of all compounds and their derivatives
were used to find the best compound-related descriptors for building
a QSPR model to predict the ESI response from molecular structures.
To correct for day-to-day variations the responses were normalized
to the response of butanoylated W measured in the same series, making
the model transferable to other instrumental settings. Most of the
compounds used to validate the model were not related to amino acids
but contained an amine group that was derivatized using the same protocol
as used for the amino acids. When ESI responses were clearly affected
by limited solubility of the reaction products (e.g., for some of
the hexanoylated derivatives showing reduced responses compared to
butanoylated derivatives), results were rejected.

After rejection
of all constant descriptors generated by the DRAGON
application, the remaining descriptors (1552 from 3224) were subjected
to cross-correlation analysis and grouped if their R2 > 0.99. Only one descriptor from every group was
used
for further model calculations, which reduced the total number of
descriptors further from 1552 to 788. Such clustering of descriptors
prevents singular matrix formation during calculation. As preliminary
research showed that direct prediction of the ESI response is unreliable,
log10 values were used instead. Thereafter, all possible
log ESI response dependencies with two descriptors were generated
using the fuzzy forward searching algorithm and all combinations with
the addition of a third descriptor were checked from the top 1000
pairs (see Supporting Information p S-11
for more details). The three-descriptor equations showed no significant
advantage over the two-descriptor model (R2 = 0.937 vs R2 = 0.911) having similar
uncertainties, although the isolated descriptors did not belong to
a cluster. In this way QSPR modeling finally resulted in two non-cross-correlated
descriptors, BIC0 and SPAN, to predict the ESI response. BIC0 is the
bonding information content index proposed by Basak et al.37 and generally describes the diversity of atomic
composition and structural groups. The SPAN geometrical index is a
simple size descriptor. It is the radius of a sphere centered in the
molecule center of a mass enclosing the entire molecule.38

The data set used for modeling contained
84 compounds in the training
set and 43 compounds in the validation set (see Table S-1 in Supporting Information). A second data set, excluding
the PEGylated substances, was used to evaluate whether the somewhat
different ESI response of PEGylated compounds affected the model.
However, the same descriptors were isolated with a slightly worse
correlation. This model was not used further. Despite the good correlation
coefficient for the training set (R2 >
0.9), leading to function 1, prediction of the ESI response across the entire validation set
was worse (R2 = 0.7). 1  While there is generally
a
good correlation between predicted and measured ESI response for the
acylated derivatives as well as for the PEGylated compounds, correlation
is rather poor for halogen and nitro group-containing compounds (Figure 5). The model tends
to
underestimate the ESI response for these molecules. Molecules with
halogen atoms or nitro groups were not part of the training set of
compounds, indicating that modeling the ESI response is restricted
to structurally related compounds. Notably the superior ESI response
of PEGylated compounds is correctly modeled.

Figure 5 Comparison of predicted
ESI responses for molecules from the training
and the validation set to the measured responses using the isolated
QSPR equation. Outliers corresponding to halogen or nitro group-containing
compounds are indicated as well as the non- and PEG-labeled compound
clusters.

Conclusions
In
a systematic study of amino acids and their acyl and PEG derivatives,
we found correlations between the ESI response and physicochemical
compound parameters. Most notable was the correlation between the
calculated molecular volume and the ESI response. Weaker, albeit still
clear, correlations were observed with hydrophobicity (log P), dissociation constant (pKa), and surface activity (negative correlation), especially when PEG
labels were not taken into account. Notwithstanding the fact that
a nonderivatized amino acid like G is already positively charged in
solution, it does not give a very strong ESI response due to its high
polarity caused by the absence of a side chain. Introduction of an
acyl group increases the ESI response which correlates with chain
length and, hence, hydrophobicity as well as RPLC retention time and
surface activity. It is of interest to note that the PEG derivatives,
which gave the strongest ESI response enhancement, did not fit the
correlation plots of the acyl derivatives of increasing chain length
except with respect to the molecular volume. We therefore consider
that the calculated molecular volume is the best overall predictor
of ESI response. This may be due to the fact that voluminous (charged)
molecules occupy more space on the limited charged surface of the
ESI droplet and consequently evaporate more easily following the ion
evaporation model. Theoretically, they will also reach a solvent-free
stage earlier following the charge residual model. Molecular volume
is related to other physicochemical properties like molecular weight,
molecular surface area, surface tension, boiling point, and solubility
as well as to critical constants like critical pressure and critical
temperature, which all may play a role, especially at the extreme
conditions during Coulombic explosions of droplets.39 It is interesting to note that ESI responses after PEG
labeling are in the same order of magnitude for all amino acids as
well as for the 41 compounds in the validation compound set. Considering
the high solubility and favorable chromatographic properties (slight
increase in hydrophobicity) of PEG derivatives, our work shows that
labeling compounds with PEG is a viable and possibly generic strategy
to enhance the ESI response of small molecules. More experimental
work is needed to gain a better understanding of the physicochemical
mechanisms behind this effect, but it is clearly of practical value.
In situ studies on droplets during the ESI process are particularly
promising to shed more light on this complex process that is of such
an importance to modern analytical chemistry.8
