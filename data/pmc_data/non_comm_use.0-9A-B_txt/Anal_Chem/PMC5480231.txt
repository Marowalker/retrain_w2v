It
is demonstrated that the adsorption of bovine serum albumin
(BSA) to aqueous gold colloids can be quantified with molecular resolution
by differential centrifugal sedimentation (DCS). This method separates
colloidal particles of comparable density by mass. When proteins adsorb
to the nanoparticles, both their mass and their effective density
change, which strongly affects the sedimentation time. A straightforward
analysis allows quantification of the adsorbed layer. Most importantly,
unlike many other methods, DCS can be used to detect chemisorbed proteins
(“hard corona”) as well as physisorbed proteins (“soft
corona”). The results for BSA on gold colloid nanoparticles
can be modeled in terms of Langmuir-type adsorption isotherms (Hill
model). The effects of surface modification with small thiol-PEG ligands
on protein adsorption are also demonstrated.

==== Body
The phenomenon
of protein adsorption
to colloidal particles has been studied for over 100 years. Zsigmondy
suggested as early as 1901 that the known protective effect of proteins
on dispersions of colloidal gold was attributable to the association
of proteins with the colloidal particles.1 He also defined the Goldzahl (German for “gold
number”) as the amount of a protective agent that is able to
prevent the aggregation of the gold colloid as manifested in a color
change from red to blue.1

Both protein
adsorption and the characteristic color change upon
addition of some reactive agent play important roles in modern gold
nanotechnology, in particular for medical diagnostics and detection.2 These applications are behind most of the renewed
interest in such adsorption phenomena. Nanoparticles (NPs) of any
type, when dispersed in a biological environment, e.g., the bloodstream,
will be coated by an adsorbed layer of different proteins, the so-called
corona.3−7 This can have significant consequences for the performance of the
particles,8−11 including their uptake into cells or their intended surface chemistry
functionality, since important functionalities may be buried or replaced
and thus inactivated by the adsorbed proteins; this may even give
rise to new and potentially undesired properties. On the other hand,
formation of a corona can also have beneficial effects, such as protecting
functional groups, increasing blood circulation times and biocompatibility
or reducing cytotoxicity.9,11−13 With the renewed interest in protein adsorption, analytical methods
that can monitor such processes and yield detailed information on
the formation, structure, composition, size and stability of the corona
are required. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) has been used extensively
for a range of nanoscopic materials including gold to study both particle
core and corona size.14−19 A potential limitation of this method is that the particles of interest
should be separated from excess protein prior to measurement to eliminate
the significant contribution of unbound protein or aggregates to the
signal.7,14,15,20 DLS also has limited resolution for small monodisperse
NPs.14,21 Likewise, transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) is a very powerful technique to directly image adsorbed proteins
and to measure the corona thickness in preprepared samples18 and more recently X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
has been used for this purpose,19 but these
techniques operate under UHV conditions and hence provide no information
on adsorption dynamics in colloidal dispersions under equilibrium
conditions. On the other hand, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy
(FCS) and plasmon scattering correlation spectroscopy (PSCS) have
been used to obtain diffusion coefficients and hence hydrodynamic
radii of nanoparticles within protein containing fluids.20,22−25 These can yield thermodynamic data on corona formation and have
shown that the process can be quantitatively described in terms of
the Hill model, i.e., Langmuir-type adsorption.

We have recently
shown that differential centrifugal sedimentation
(DCS) can be employed as an easy-to-use and yet highly sensitive technique
to measure differences as small as the length of a single carbon–carbon
bond in the ligand shell thickness of thiolate stabilized gold nanoparticles.21 We demonstrate here that this technique is also
suitable to monitor protein adsorption to gold nanoparticles and to
determine the thermodynamic constants that govern this process. In
addition, it is possible to distinguish between chemi- and physisorbed
protein layers, sometimes called “hard” and “soft”
corona, and some information on the adsorption geometry can be obtained
as long as the size and shape of the adsorbate are known. DCS has
been used before, chiefly to complement more extensive studies of
protein corona formation on silica and polystyrene spheres4,5,17,26 or gold nanoparticles,19,27 but not under true
equilibrium conditions, i.e., with the protein present in the centrifuge
medium, which as shown below, is necessary to obtain accurate information
on physisorbed layers. Unlike FCS, DCS does not require a highly sophisticated
setup and does not require the addition of fluorescent labels but
can be applied directly to any kind of nanoparticle; unlike PSCS,
it also can be applied to small NPs which do not provide enough scattering
signal for correlation spectroscopy. A related method, analytical
ultracentrifugation (AUC) has recently been used for investigating
protein corona formation on gold nanoparticles,28 although no distinction was made in that report between
chemi- and physisorbed coronas.

To demonstrate the usefulness
of DCS for investigating chemi- and
physisorbed protein layers on NPs, the adsorption of bovine serum
albumin (BSA) to gold NPs with different surface functionalization
was investigated. Serum albumin is one of the most abundant proteins
in the blood plasma, typically present at concentrations above 10
g/L, and is the main protein in the corona formed on citrate-stabilized
gold NPs in the widely used cell culture medium containing fetal bovine
serum.29 Pure BSA was used here to avoid
the complexity of biological media which usually contains a mixture
of proteins, sugars, and electrolytes. The gold NPs investigated were
citrate-stabilized NPs, and NPs functionalized with thiolated poly(ethylene
glycol) ligands having either carboxyl (PEG-COOH) or hydroxyl (PEG-OH)
end groups. Citrate ligands are expected to exchange with protein,
thus allowing for direct protein adsorption onto the gold NP surface;
on the other hand, PEG-OH was chosen for its known lack of binding
to proteins,6,25,30 whereas PEG-COOH ligands also prevent the interaction of the protein
with the gold NPs but are likely to interact directly with proteins.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
HAuCl4 trihydrate; sodium citrate
tribasic dihydrate, ≥99.5% purity; bovine serum albumin (BSA),
≥98%; and sucrose, ≥ 99.5%, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and used as supplied. Thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) ligands, HS-(CH2)11-(EG)6-OH (PEG-OH) and HS-(CH2)11-(EG)6-OCH2-COOH (PEG-COOH),
were purchased from ProChimia Surfaces and used as supplied.

Nanoparticles
Citrate-stabilized gold NPs (diameter
∼11 nm) were synthesized following a modified Turkevich-Frens
method.31,32 In brief, 20 mL of a hot 40 mM aqueous citrate
solution were added to a boiling solution of 200 μmol of HAuCl4 trihydrate in 200 mL of Milli-Q water and refluxed under
vigorous stirring for 60 min; the solution was then cooled overnight
under stirring and subsequently filtered. PEG-stabilized NPs were
prepared by overnight incubation of citrate-stabilized NPs in 0.45
mM PEG, corresponding to a more than 10-fold excess with respect to
the number of gold atoms on the NP surface. Excess PEG ligands were
removed by at least three cycles of centrifugation (15 000
rpm, 30 min, 10 °C) and resuspension of the NPs in Milli-Q water.
All samples were characterized by UV–vis spectroscopy, which
showed the characteristic shift of the plasmon resonance band upon
ligand exchange (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) and by DCS (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Size distributions for (A) citrate- and (B,C) PEG-stabilized gold
NPs, before (dashed lines) and after (solid lines) 24 h incubation
in BSA solutions of different concentrations, as indicated. The data
shown here were obtained with the same concentration of BSA in the
DCS-gradient fluid as used during NP incubation. The dotted lines
in parts B and C show the distribution for citrate-stabilized NPs
in the absence of BSA.

Corona Formation
BSA solutions in Milli-Q water at
different concentrations were prepared freshly on the day of the experiment
from stock solution (100 mg/mL). BSA solution, NP solution, and Milli-Q
water were combined to yield a final NP concentration of ∼10
nM, as determined by UV–vis spectroscopy33 and BSA concentrations in the range 0.1–500 μM.
The samples were vigorously shaken and left overnight (except where
stated explicitly) in standard Eppendorff tubes, which are known to
be resistant to protein binding. Protein corona formation was confirmed
by UV–vis spectroscopy19,27 (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), which for citrate-stabilized
gold NPs in BSA solution showed a shift and absorbance increase of
the plasmon resonance band with increasing BSA concentration, as expected
for an increase of the capping layer.33 On the other hand, only smaller changes were found for gold NPs@PEG-COOH,
for which the protein corona forms at a distance of ∼3 nm from
the gold core and thus has less effect on its optical properties,
and no shift at all was observed for gold NPs@PEG-OH, which do not
form a significant protein corona (vide infra). The
pH, measured with a Whatman PHA230 pH meter with a Hanna Instruments
microelectrode (HI 1083), of citrate-stabilized NP solutions increased
from 6.1 (no BSA) to 7.1 (high BSA concentration); the latter value
corresponds to the pH of the BSA stock solution. The pH of PEG-stabilized
NPs in the absence or presence of BSA was around 7 for all samples.
Only where stated explicitly, excess BSA was removed after overnight
incubation of citrate-stabilized NPs by three cycles of centrifugation
(15 000 rpm, 30 min, 5 °C) and resuspension of the NPs
in 3.6 mM citrate solution (citrate-stabilized NPs) or Milli-Q water
(PEG-stabilized NPs).

UV–Visible Spectroscopy
Spectra
were recorded
in the range 400–800 nm using a Genesys 10S UV–vis spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific) and a 1 cm path length cuvette.

Differential
Centrifugal Sedimentation
NP size distributions
were recorded using a disc centrifuge (DC24000, CPS Instruments Inc.).21 A sucrose gradient (nine solutions in the range
8%–24% sucrose w/v in Milli-Q water or BSA solution) was filled
into the disc rotating at 24 000 rpm, followed by a thin layer
of dodecane, and allowed to equilibrate. The instrument was calibrated
using poly(vinyl chloride) standard particles (0.226 μm, Analytik
Ltd.) before each measurement. A minimum of three
concordant measurements per sample were obtained to ensure reproducibility.
All samples were gently up-turned 10 times prior to injection.

Results
and Discussion
Differential Centrifugal Sedimentation
DCS is a comparatively
simple and easy-to-use experimental technique that physically separates
NPs by size before detecting them and thereby yields highly accurate
size distributions. This is achieved by sedimentation in a centrifugal
disk containing a liquid whose density increases toward the outer
edge, which guarantees stable sedimentation governed by Stokes’
law. Near the outer edge of the disk, NPs are detected using light
absorbance and scattering and their size is determined from their
sedimentation time (vide infra). It has been shown
that DCS can be used to detect differences in the size of gold NP
samples and/or their ligand shell with a resolution of 0.1 nm.21

Figure 1 shows example size distributions for citrate- and
PEG-stabilized gold NPs before and after protein corona formation
by incubation in BSA solution. The data shown here were measured with
BSA in the DCS-gradient fluid at the same concentration as used during
incubation, distributions measured without BSA in the gradient fluid
are shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information. These distributions show that the NP samples were highly monodisperse
and that the width of the size distribution was not affected by functionalization
with PEG-ligands or incubation in BSA solution, except for citrate-stabilized
NPs after incubation at low BSA concentration when measured in the
absence of BSA in the gradient fluid (Figure S2), for which a heterogeneous size distribution was found, ranging
from slightly smaller to larger diameters than the original NPs. This
can be ascribed to a partial loss of the citrate capping layer due
to the reduction of citrate concentration upon addition of the BSA
solution, with only some NPs adsorbing a few proteins. After incubation
with ≥1 μM BSA, no such broadening was observed, indicating
more homogeneous corona formation.

The size distributions shown
in Figure 1 show that
upon functionalization with PEG
and/or protein corona formation, the apparent particle size, i.e.,
the size reported by the instrument, decreased. This is due to a necessary
oversimplification in the analysis of the raw data, as has been noted
previously.21,34 Briefly, the instrument records
the sedimentation time t which a particular fraction
of the sample requires for traveling from the top of the gradient
liquid to the point where they are detected. For a spherical nanoparticle
with diameter d, this time is given by 1  where ρeff is the
(effective)
density of the NP, ρfl is the average density of
the gradient solution, and C is a constant depending
on solution viscosity, centrifuge speed, and cell geometry, which
is determined using a calibration sample of known diameter. For calculating
the size distribution from the distribution of sedimentation times,
the operator has to specify the particle density; in the absence of
information on the ligand layer thickness, the value of the core material
(ρAu = 19.3 g/cm3) is used as a realistic a priori approximation. Since the density of the ligand
shell is significantly lower, this is an overestimation of ρeff which leads to an underestimation of the particle size, eq 1; in the case of organic
molecules on gold NPs this overcompensates the actual size increase
due to the ligand shell, see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information.

For a quantitative correction
of this effect,4,5,21,26 one needs
to account for the effective density, ρeff, which
depends on the character of the ligand shell. For a gold NP with core
diameter dAu and a homogeneous shell (citrate,
PEG, or protein) of thickness s and density ρshell, ρeff is given by 2  

However, for PEG-functionalized NPs, where the corona is formed
on top of the layer of covalently bound ligands, one has to distinguish
between the shells formed by the PEG-ligands, with thickness sPEG and density ρPEG, and the
protein layer, with thickness sProt and
density ρProt: 3  where dAu-PEG = dAu + 2sPEG is the diameter of the PEG-functionalized NP before corona formation.

In line with our previous work,21 the
density of a dense capping layer (citrate, PEG) was assumed to be
similar to that of proteins, i.e., 1.4 g/cm3;35 variation of this value by ±0.2 g/cm3 has virtually no effect on the value of dAu determined from the DCS results (vide infra), and only minimally affects the results for the capping layer thickness
(±0.2 nm). For the effective density of the protein corona, ρProt, on the other hand, a lower value of 1.15 g/cm3 was assumed, to account for the fact that due to the irregular shape
of proteins the corona does not constitute a closely packed layer
but contains a significant amount of solvent. This value is slightly
smaller than the density of hydrated protein crystals (∼1.25
g/cm3),36 in agreement with
the higher porosity expected for a thin protein corona on a NP. Similar
values have been suggested previously or determined indirectly for
protein coronas on NPs;4,5,17,26,27 the value
is also in full agreement with the reported water content of a BSA
corona on gold NPs of 70%.19 The uncertainty
of this value is the main contribution to the uncertainty of the corona
thickness sProt; the error bars shown
in Figure 2 indicate
the variation of sProt when varying ρProt in the range 1.1–1.2 g/cm3. A more detailed
discussion of the effect of this uncertainty of ρProt is given in the Supporting Information (section S3). It should be noted that when assuming a value of ρProt larger than 1.23 g/cm3, no solution for eq 4 is possible for the results
at the highest BSA concentrations, confirming the need to use a smaller
value. In the absence of BSA in the gradient fluid, the (average)
density of the gradient fluid, ρfl, is 1.064 g/cm3. For measurements with BSA in the gradient fluid, this value
was corrected for the presence of protein with higher density (1.4
g/cm3)35 based on the volume
fraction of protein added; this correction had a measurable effect
only at the highest BSA concentrations.

Figure 2 BSA corona thickness

after 24 h incubation at different BSA concentrations. Solid symbols
refer to DCS-measurements with BSA present in the gradient fluid at
the same concentration as during incubation, open symbols refer to
DCS-measurements in the absence of BSA in the gradient fluid, and
solid/open symbols show the difference between these results. The
open circles at [BSA] = 100 μM show the results obtained immediately
after removal of excess BSA from the sample by centrifugation, the
open down-triangles those obtained for the same samples 24 h later.
The solid red lines in panel A are fits of the data to the Hill model, eqs 5 and 6, yielding values of smax = (5.7 ±
0.2) nm, KD = (7.0 ± 2.5) μM, n = (0.75 ± 0.10) for chemisorbed BSA on citrate-NPs,
and smax = (2.0 ± 0.1) nm, KD = (17.8 ± 1.5) μM, n = (2.0 ± 0.3) for the additional physisorbed protein layer;
the dashed red line is a fit of the data to a Langmuir isotherm (eqs 5 and 6 for n = 1), yielding KD = (4.1 ± 0.9) μM.

The instrument’s analysis of the experimental sedimentation
time is based on eq 1 but uses the density of gold, ρAu, in place of
the correct value ρeff, so that the NP diameter reported
by the instrument, dDCS, relates to the
correct diameter d (d = dAu + 2s for NPs with a single
homogeneous shell consisting of citrate, PEG, or protein, d = dAu + 2sPEG + 2sProt for PEG-functionalized
NPs with protein corona) according to 4  

Using the experimental result dDCS, eq 4, together with either eqs 2 or 3, can be solved numerically
for dAU and s or dAu-PEG and sProt, respectively, if one of the parameters
can be determined independently. In previous reports on the determination
of the thickness of a chemisorbed protein corona on gold NPs, dAu was determined using DLS, although it was
pointed out that this may result in some inaccuracy and even account
for some of the discrepancies found in these studies.19,27 We had determined the thickness s of a citrate
layer on gold NPs to be 1 nm by DCS, using a peptide (CALNN) as an
“internal standard”;21 here,
this value was used to determine the value of the core diameter dAu from the DCS results for citrate-stabilized
NPs; a value of dAu = 10.8 nm was obtained
for the batch of NPs used here. This value was then used for analyzing
the corona thickness on citrate-stabilized NPs, where the protein
is expected to replace the citrate layer, see Figure 2A, and to determine the thickness of the
PEG layers, sPEG, on PEG-functionalized
NPs, using eq 2. Values
of sPEG-COOH = 3.0 nm and sPEG-OH = 1.9 nm were obtained for the
PEG-functionalized NPs in the absence of BSA. The values of dAu and sPEG thus
determined were used to calculate the thickness of the protein corona
on PEG-stabilized NPs using eq 3, see Figure 2B,C.

Corona Formation on Citrate-Stabilized NPs
Figure 2A shows a significant
increase of the measured capping layer thickness after incubation
of citrate-stabilized NPs with BSA for 24 h, when compared to the
thickness of the citrate capping layer; this confirms that BSA forms
a protein corona on gold NPs.14−16,18,19,25,37−40 The observation that corona formation by BSA (isoelectric
point, 4.741) or human serum albumin (HSA),
which is almost identical to BSA,42 leads
to a reduction of the negative zeta potential of citrate-stabilized
gold NPs,16,19,25 and the fact
that BSA-stabilized gold NPs have the same isoelectric point as BSA38 strongly suggest that the weakly bound citrate
layer gets replaced by a protein corona which binds directly to the
gold surface, although at lower BSA concentrations some citrate is
expected to remain on those parts of the NP surface not covered by
protein.

Most importantly, at concentrations in excess of ∼10
μM, the measured protein corona thickness depends on the presence
of BSA in the gradient fluid. With BSA in the gradient fluid at the
same concentration as used for incubation (solid symbols), the equilibrium
between adsorbed and free protein which had been established during
the 24-h incubation period is maintained throughout the measurement,
so that the results reflect the thickness of the corona on nanoparticles
in the presence of free protein, which may consist of tightly bound
chemisorbed proteins (“hard corona”) and/or loosely
bound physisorbed proteins (“soft corona”).

In
the absence of BSA in the gradient fluid, on the other hand,
a slightly thinner protein layer is found at higher BSA concentrations,
indicating the loss of some of the adsorbed proteins upon injection.
This loss of part of the corona within the time scale of the DCS experiment,
i.e., within a few minutes, is in agreement with previous reports
of such rapid removal of the physisorbed corona.3,6 However,
even the complete removal of excess BSA by repeated centrifugation
prior to the DCS measurement (open circle in Figure 2A) or incubation in BSA-free citrate solution
for 24 h (open triangle) do not significantly affect the measured
corona thickness. This not only shows that most of the BSA adsorbed
to gold NPs is bound very strongly (chemisorbed) and is not released
even upon prolonged exposure to protein-free citrate solution, but
it also shows that the loss of the weakly adsorbed fraction of the
corona occurs almost immediately upon injection into the gradient
fluid, i.e., on a similar time scale as formation of the corona (vide infra). Thus, the results obtained with a BSA-free
gradient fluid reflect tightly bound chemisorbed proteins (“hard
corona”) without the need of prior removal of excess protein
from the sample.

Most of our results were obtained after incubation
for 24 h to
ensure full equilibration.15 However, Figure 3 shows that most
of the chemisorbed corona is formed on the subminute time scale: when
injecting the NP/BSA mixture into a BSA-free gradient 15 s after mixing,
a corona thickness corresponding to 85% of the maximum thickness is
observed, with the remainder formed within 1 h. None of the previous
studies attempting to observe the kinetics of formation of a chemisorbed
corona had comparable time resolution, since all required extensive
sample purification; therefore, it was only known that a BSA or HSA
corona on citrate-stabilized NPs is formed within 15–30 min.16,37,40 Interestingly, the process is
faster than the formation of a “hard” corona, consisting
largely of albumins, on citrate-stabilized gold NPs upon incubation
in serum;15 this highlights the complex
kinetics of corona formation which is governed by competition between
different serum components.3,5,8,43

Figure 3 Variation of the BSA corona thickness
formed upon incubation of
citrate-stabilized NPs in 7.2 μM BSA for increasing incubation
times (15 s to 24 h); the value at time zero refers to the thickness
of the citrate layer; the solid line is a guide to the eye.

Together, these results indicate
that BSA rapidly forms a chemisorbed
“hard” corona on citrate-stabilized gold NPs with a
maximum effective thickness of 5.7 nm, in addition to which at concentrations
in excess of ∼10 μM, some BSA proteins are physisorbed
(“soft” corona), increasing the corona thickness by
an additional 2 nm at the highest concentrations; this fraction of
the corona is present only as long as the NP remains in the protein
solution. It should be pointed out, however, that even at the highest
BSA concentrations, BSA did not form multilayers on NPs, as had been suggested previously for BSA
coronas on a variety of NPs.22,44

Previous reports
on the formation of a chemisorbed corona of BSA
or HSA on gold NPs, using DLS, yielded values of a similar order of
magnitude for the corona thickness,14−16,18,19,40 although it should be noted that DLS only poorly reproduces the
size distribution of NPs in the 10–50 nm range.14,21 DLS measurements in the presence of high concentrations of protein,
on the other hand, can be distorted by contributions of unbound protein
or aggregates to the signal,14,15 and hence, to the best
of our knowledge, no DLS experiments investigating the physisorbed
(soft) corona have been reported for gold NPs. PCSC was used to investigate
the BSA corona formed on gold NPs in the presence of high BSA concentrations,
yielding values which are in agreement with the results reported here.25 A BSA corona thickness of 3–5 nm on citrate-stabilized
gold NPs was determined using TEM18 or
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,19 which
is in reasonable agreement with the results reported here, considering
that those techniques are performed in vacuum and report on the dry
ligand shell only.

Corona Formation on PEG-Functionalized NPs
Figure 2B,C summarizes
the
BSA corona thickness on PEG-functionalized gold NPs. NPs with a PEG-OH
ligand layer form no BSA corona, not even a physisorbed “soft”
corona; even with BSA present in the gradient fluid at concentrations
as high as 500 μM, no significant shift of the NP size is found.
This is in agreement with the general observation that PEG-OH layers
lead to reduced, although not necessarily completely inhibited, protein
corona formation on NPs6,25,30 and that they prevent adsorption of BSA to gold surfaces.45

NPs with a carboxylated PEG (PEG-COOH)
ligand layer, on the other hand, show measurable corona formation
even at lower BSA concentrations, similar to that found for citrate-stabilized
NPs. As for citrate-stabilized NPs, most of this corona is formed
by chemisorbed proteins, since even in the absence of BSA in the gradient
fluid a significant capping layer can be observed. On the other hand,
it appears that chemisorptive binding of BSA to the PEG-COOH capping
layer is slightly less stable than binding to citrate-stabilized gold
NPs, since removal of excess BSA after formation of the corona on
NP@PEG-COOH and incubation in neat water results in a slight decrease
of the corona thickness (open circle and triangle at [BSA] = 100 μM
in Figure 2B). For
BSA concentrations exceeding 10 μM, an additional physisorbed
protein layer is formed on top of the chemisorbed corona which can
only be observed with BSA in the gradient fluid. It should be noted
that the uncertainty of the corona thickness arising from the uncertainty
of the value of ρProt is significantly larger for
these NPs than for citrate-stabilized NPs because of the increased
thickness of the organic capping layer, as discussed in detail in
the Supporting Information (section S3).

BSA Adsorption Isotherms
A quantitative analysis of
the experimentally observed adsorption isotherms was performed using
the Hill equation, which has been used previously for protein corona
formation on NPs.22,25,28 It should be noted that the Hill model assumes full equilibration
on the experimental time scale and thus may not be correct for all
combinations of NPs and proteins;24,28 in fact, our
observation that the removal of the chemisorbed corona in BSA-free
solution takes significantly longer than 24 h raises serious doubts
about the validity of this model. Thus, it is used here only as a
convenient model equation and it is not meant to imply any mechanistic
explanation.46 The Hill equation predicts
that the number of proteins adsorbed per NP, N, is
given by 5  Here, Nmax is
the maximum number of proteins that can be adsorbed per NP, [BSA]
the molar concentration of BSA, KD the
Hill dissociation constant, i.e., the protein concentration at which
half of the adsorption sites are occupied, and n the
Hill coefficient which characterizes the cooperativity of adsorption.
For fitting the dependence of the corona thickness on the protein
concentration (Figure 2), it is assumed that the NP-protein complex adopts a spherical shape
with a volume VNP + N × VBSA, where VNP denotes the volume of the nanoparticle (including the
strongly bound PEG capping layer, where appropriate) and VBSA the effective volume of a single protein. Thus, the
effective particle diameter d is given by 6  where c = VBSA/VNP and dNP is the diameter of the NP around which the
corona is
formed, i.e., dNP = dAu for citrate-stabilized NPs and dNP = dAu + 2sPEG for PEG-functionalized NPs.47 Fits of the experimental adsorption isotherms (Figure 2) to this equation were performed
with KD, n, and c × Nmax as free parameters
using a nonlinear least-squares fitting routine (Microcal Origin);
the value of c × Nmax can then be used to calculate the maximum effective corona thickness.48

This model results in a good fit of the
data for the chemisorbed corona on citrate-stabilized NPs, Figure 2A, yielding a maximum
effective corona thickness of 5.7 nm, a Hill dissociation constant
of 7 μM, and a Hill coefficient of 0.75, which indicates anticooperative
behavior, presumably reflecting steric hindrance of adsorption by
proteins which are already bound to the NP. In comparison, a fit to
a Langmuir isotherm, which does not account for anticooperativity,
yields poorer agreement with the data, see dashed line in Figure 2A; thus, the high
precision of our data allows us to distinguish the effects of even
weak anticooperativity. The Langmuir dissociation constant of 4.1
μM is of similar magnitude as the Langmuir dissociation constants
of 0.6–2 μM reported for BSA binding to flat gold surfaces,38 or citrate-stabilized gold NPs of 3–60
nm diameter,14,39 although in those reports the
BSA solution appears not to have been removed, suggesting that the
total corona (physi- and chemisorbed) was studied.

As discussed
above, the data obtained for citrate-stabilized NPs
in the presence of BSA in the gradient fluid are related to the formation
of a weakly bound physisorbed corona on top of the chemisorbed corona
at BSA concentrations above ∼10 μM. Given the complexity
of this situation with two very different binding mechanisms, we do
not think that fits of these data to the Langmuir or the Hill model
are appropriate, although they are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S4) for comparison with results
in the literature. An estimate of the effective thickness of the physisorbed
layer was obtained by subtracting the data obtained in the absence
of BSA in the gradient fluid from those obtained in the presence of
BSA, see Figure 2.
These data were fitted to the Hill model, eqs 5 and 6, using a (BSA-concentration
dependent) value for the NP diameter dNP in eq 6, which includes
the chemisorbed corona thickness obtained from the fit described above.
This model results in a good fit, see Figure 2A, with a physisorbed corona thickness of
2.0 nm, a Hill dissociation constant KD of 17.8 μM, which obviously is significantly larger than that
of the chemisorbed corona, and a Hill coefficient of 2, indicating
cooperative binding.

The adsorption isotherms of NPs with a
PEG-COOH ligand layer, Figure 2B, on the other hand,
are less well-defined, both for the chemisorbed corona, measured with
no BSA in the gradient fluid, and the combined physi- and chemisorbed
corona, measured with BSA in the gradient fluid. These isotherms suggest
highly anticooperative adsorption with a Hill coefficient well below n = 0.5, although the limited concentration range prevents
determination of the exact value, compare Figure S5 in the Supporting Information. For the same reason,
it is not possible to provide exact values for the dissociation constant
or the maximum shell thickness.

Structure of BSA Corona
Figure 4A shows
the X-ray structure of BSA.42 The protein
has the shape of an equilateral
triangular prism with a height of ∼6.5 nm and a thickness of
∼3 nm; phosphorescence depolarization results show that this
shape is maintained in solution, albeit with slightly larger dimensions
due to the protein hydration layer.49 Notably,
cysteine 34, which is the only cysteine not forming an intraprotein
disulfide bond, is located close to the protein surface at the base
of the prism and has been implicated in the formation of interprotein
disulfide bonds during protein isolation.42

Cartoon representation of the hard corona formed by BSA on a gold
NP with 10.8 nm diameter; the dotted line indicates the effective
corona thickness of 5.7 nm determined here (all size dimensions to
scale).

Previously, the adsorption of
HSA on FePt and CdSe@ZnS nanocrystals
coated with carboxylic acid functionalized polymers (diameter 10–15
nm) had been investigated by FCS, indicating a maximum corona thickness
of 3.3 nm in the presence of HSA (“soft” corona).22 This was taken as an indication that serum albumin
binds with its flat triangular surface on the NP surface, which is
consistent with the existence of a patch of positive charges on one
of these triangular surfaces, suggesting electrostatic binding of
serum albumin to the negatively charged NP surface.23

In contrast, our results show that incubation of
citrate-stabilized
gold NPs with BSA leads to the formation of a chemisorbed protein
corona with an effective thickness of 5.7 nm. We suggest that this
strong binding is achieved by the formation of a covalent bond between
gold and the sulfur of cysteine 34, located at the base of the triangular
prism. This leads to the formation of a layer of proteins which stand
“upright” on the NP surface, as shown schematically
in Figure 4B. The actual
height of the protein is approximately 6.5 nm, which is compatible
with the measured effective corona thickness of 5.7 nm. It should
be noted that the effective hydrodynamic size (Stokes diameter) of
irregularly shaped NPs with a highly corrugated surface layer, such
as shown in Figure 4B, is not the same as that of a spherical NP with the same volume,
even if this approximation is widely made, since the hydrodynamic
drag of the “protrusions” is not completely compensated
by the “depressions”. Moreover, an analysis of the effective
layer thickness of a protein corona also needs to account for the
protein’s hydration layer, which has a thickness of 0.3–1
nm.50,51 Both of these effects are difficult to quantify;
therefore, no attempt was made to quantify the number of BSA proteins
adsorbed on each NP from the data.

This model of the chemisorbed
BSA corona on gold NPs assumes that
no significant structural changes of the protein take place when BSA
binds. Gold NPs with a BSA corona are recognized by BSA-antibodies,15 which indicates that the protein structure remains
intact in the corona; this conclusion was further supported by temperature-dependent
UV–vis spectroscopy results, which suggest that BSA on gold
NPs is not denatured at room temperature,53 and CD spectra of BSA bound to gold nanorods, which show that only
minor structural changes occur upon binding.54

The suggestion that BSA is bound to gold NPs by a covalent
bond
contradicts the suggestion which if often found in the literature
that the protein corona is formed by noncovalent interactions. However,
the observation that BSA remains bound to gold NPs for at least a
day (and potentially much longer) even in the absence of free BSA
strongly supports this suggestion. Covalent binding between BSA and
the NP also makes it likely that the protein would not easily exchange
with other “hard corona” proteins in solution and may
be the reason for the memory effect that has been described in the
literature, i.e., the fact that the corona composition after incubation
in complex biological samples depends on details of the incubation
history.11,55 In this context, it is also interesting
to note that the chemisorbed BSA corona on citrate-stabilized gold
NPs is formed within seconds of incubation in BSA solution, which
is much faster than the usual hour time scales for hard corona formation
in serum.3,8,15 This is due
to the competition between serum components with different binding
modalities, including proteins with weaker but faster adsorption which
rapidly cover the NP surface during the initial phase of corona formation,
thus preventing fast formation of the hard corona which eventually
develops.

Conclusions
It has been demonstrated
that DCS can follow with high precision
the subtle changes in NP size due to the formation of a protein corona
upon incubation of gold NPs in protein solution, even for NPs as small
as 10 nm and, most importantly, can easily provide data for both,
the “soft” and the “hard” corona, i.e.,
the corona before and after removal of excess protein. This ability
to investigate the “soft” corona is in contrast to many
other techniques, in particular DLS, which require removal of excess
protein or involve dilution and hence alter the corona. Since most
medical applications of NPs proceed in the presence of excess protein,
investigation of the “soft” corona often is more relevant
than that of the “hard” corona alone. Some other techniques
in principle allow the investigation of both “soft”
and “hard” coronas, in particular fluorescence or scattering
correlation spectroscopy20,22−25 or analytical ultracentrifugation;28 in
comparison to these methods, DCS is an easy-to-use technique which
does not require a sophisticated setup, mathematical deconvolution
of the raw data, or specialist expertise. Moreover, FCS requires the
presence of a fluorescent label, and PSCS suffers from comparatively
poor resolution and is limited to larger NPs; none of these drawbacks
affect DCS or AUC. Finally, it was shown that the kinetics of corona
formation on the subminute time scale is also accessible by DCS.
