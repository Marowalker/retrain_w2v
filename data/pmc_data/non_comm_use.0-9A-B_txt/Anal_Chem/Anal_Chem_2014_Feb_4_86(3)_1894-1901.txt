Isotopic labeling studies of primary
metabolism frequently utilize
GC/MS to quantify 13C in protein-hydrolyzed amino acids.
During processing some amino acids are degraded, which reduces the
size of the measurement set. The advent of high-resolution mass spectrometers
provides a tool to assess molecular masses of peptides with great
precision and accuracy and computationally infer information about
labeling in amino acids. Amino acids that are isotopically labeled
during metabolism result in labeled peptides that contain spatial
and temporal information that is associated with the biosynthetic
origin of the protein. The quantification of isotopic labeling in
peptides can therefore provide an assessment of amino acid metabolism
that is specific to subcellular, cellular, or temporal conditions.
A high-resolution orbital trap was used to quantify isotope labeling
in peptides that were obtained from unlabeled and isotopically labeled
soybean embryos and Escherichia coli cultures. Standard deviations were determined by estimating the
multinomial variance associated with each element of the m/z distribution. Using the estimated variance, quantification
of the m/z distribution across multiple
scans was achieved by a nonlinear fitting approach. Observed m/z distributions of uniformly labeled E. coli peptides indicated no significant differences
between observed and simulated m/z distributions. Alternatively, amino acid m/z distributions obtained from GC/MS were convolved to simulate
peptide m/z distributions but resulted
in distinct profiles due to the production of protein prior to isotopic
labeling. The results indicate that peptide mass isotopologue measurements
faithfully represent mass distributions, are suitable for quantification
of isotope-labeling-based studies, and provide additional information
over existing methods.

==== Body
Eukaryotic
metabolism occurs
within tissues and organelles and is therefore highly organized at
both cellular and subcellular levels. Along with temporal developmental
queues, the spatial architecture complicates experiments in cell biology.
Nonetheless, genetic engineering relies on knowledge of cellular location
and timing for the design of transit peptides and promoter sequences.
The importance of properly selective targeting in plants is well-known
and includes dramatic examples such as increased levels of carotenoid
production by 50-fold1 and leaves that
produce a significant percentage of total dry weight as polyhydroxybutrate.2 Metabolic studies often lack subcellular and
temporal detail, resulting in a disconnect between the ability to
generate active enzymes transgenically and foreseeing their impact
on metabolic network function.

Metabolic flux analysis (MFA)
based on isotopic labeling provides
a description of cellular operation to aid engineering and can indicate
unconventional pathway use in plants (reviewed in refs (3−6)), but frequently flux maps are not extensively resolved at the subcellular
level. Obtaining information specific to compartments in eukaryotes
is experimentally challenging and limits quantitative cellular descriptions.7−18 Recently we reported an approach to investigate the labeling in
protein subunits that are made in different locations.19 Proteins in plants are translated from one of
three genomes located in the chloroplast, nucleus, or mitochondria.
Peptide translation utilizes amino acid pools specific to a particular
organelle, and therefore, 13C-labeling analysis can detect
the subcellular biosynthesis on the basis of differences in enrichment.
For example, the large and small subunits of RuBisCO were compared
after culturing Brassica napus embryos
in 13C medium. Disparities in isotopic labeling indicated
that amino acids were made in different locations, but the sensitivity
of GC/MS and losses in protein and amino acids during processing limited
this approach to abundant, relatively pure proteins that meet steady-state
labeling criteria.

Given the challenges associated with obtaining
reliable amino acid
labeling information for proteins present at low abundance, we developed
LC–MS/MS-linked orbital ion trap (LC-ESI-LTQ-Orbitrap Velos,
ThermoElectron; referred to hereafter as “orbital trap”)
techniques to accurately measure labeling in peptides. Peptide enrichment
can be subsequently used to infer labeling in amino acids when deconvolved
through metabolic flux analysis.20 The
direct measurement of peptides has several benefits relative to traditional
assessments of labeling in protein-hydrolyzed amino acids. First,
proteins from biomass can be processed with limited or no purification.
Protein sequence identification is genome-specific and can be linked
with cell type or subcellular location and therefore does not depend
upon the isolation purity of the protein. In fact, potentially many
proteins from different locations could be simultaneously analyzed
in a single experiment. Furthermore, peptides can provide labeling
information on up to all 20 amino acids because hydrolysis steps that
degrade amino acids are avoided. Given that GC/MS methods usually
do not report tryptophan or cysteine due to oxidative degradation,
asparagine or glutamine due to deamidation, arginine due to complex
cracking patterns, and other amino acids including histidine, lysine,
and methionine that are not always present in sufficient amounts for
analyses, an alternative sensitive method that provides additional
information is desired for metabolic studies.

High-resolution
MS instruments can quantify proteins and measure
peptide masses with parts per million accuracy21 and attomolar sensitivities.22 Quantification methods including SILAC (stable isotope labeling
with amino acids)23,24 and iTRAQ (isobaric tags for
relative and absolute quantitation),25 and
their derivatives26−28 rely on isotopic labeling to distinguish proteins
on the basis of mass (reviewed in refs (29−32)). Proteomic investigations have also used isotopes to evaluate protein
turnover33−35 and altered protein production36−38 and to qualitatively
inspect amino acids.39 Recent metabolite
studies have focused on distinguishing elemental isotopes40 and enhanced small molecule identification,41−43 but these methods have not aimed to accurately quantify large m/z envelopes that accompany isotopic labeling
in peptides, which is the focus of this study.

Labeled protein
was obtained from Escherichia coli grown
with 7% uniformly labeled glucose or from developing soybeans
cultured with [U-13C6]glucose. The instrument
resolution, sensitivity, variation in scans, dynamic range, and accuracy
were all probed. Peptide characteristics including the charge state,
oxidation number, and peptide lengths established through proteolysis
were also evaluated. In single scans, peptide m/z distributions were converted to absolute ion estimates,
which made it possible to associate a multinomial variance with each
element of the m/z distribution.
With the estimated variance, m/z distributions were quantified across multiple scans using a nonlinear
fitting approach. The observed isotopologues from uniformly labeled E. coli peptides indicated no significant differences
between observed and simulated m/z distributions. The same protein was hydrolyzed, and isotopic labeling
in amino acids was quantified with GC/MS. The amino acid measurements
were subsequently convolved and compared with those obtained directly
from the orbital trap. Isotopically labeled amino acids measured by
GC/MS resulted in simulated peptides that were distinct from those
directly measured with the orbital trap.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
[U-13C6]Glucose, sucrose,
glucose, glutamine, asparagine, plant protease inhibitor cocktail,
Ponceau-S, bovine serum albumin (BSA), trypsin, chymotrypsin, thermolysin,
proteinase K, and all common buffer reagents were obtained from Sigma
(St. Louis, MO). Sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) reagents were purchased from Life
Technologies Inc. (Carlsbad, CA), and derivatization reagent N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide
(MTBSTFA) + 1% tert-butyldimethylchlorosilane (TBDMCS)
was purchased from Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA).

E. coli Culture
E. coli strain G1655CGSC was cultured at 37 °C
with vigorous shaking in M9 medium containing 0.4% unlabeled glucose
or glucose uniformly labeled with 7% 13C. To ensure that
all newly synthesized protein was made from labeled glucose, 100 mL
of medium was inoculated with 1 mL of starting culture and grown to
an OD600 of 1.0. A 10 mL volume of this culture was transferred to
900 mL of medium and grown to an OD600 of 1.2. Cells were harvested
by centrifugation at 14 000 rpm for 20 min and stored at −80
°C until use.

Soy Embryo Culture
Glycine max (cv. Jack) was grown in greenhouse conditions,
which included a
14 h/10 h light/dark cycle, daily watering, and fertilization. Green
soybean pods were harvested, immediately placed on ice, and sterilized
with 5% bleach followed by sterile H2O. Embryos of 25–40
mg (fresh weight) were excised under sterile conditions. Embryos were
placed in a 250 mL flask containing 15 mL of culture medium: 150 mM
sucrose, 75 mM glucose, 45 mM glutamine, 16 mM asparagine, 5 mM MES,
pH 5.7, with KOH.44 Trace salts and vitamins45,46 were added, and the medium was filter sterilized. For labeling experiments
[U-13C6]glucose was exchanged for unlabeled
glucose. Embryos were grown for two weeks in a humidified incubator
with constant 30 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 at 27 °C.

Protein Isolation
Total soluble protein was isolated
from E. coli as described in the Supporting Information (Experimental Methods).
Briefly, cells cultured in M9 medium were isolated, and subsequently
DNA was precipitated with ammonium sulfate. Protein was further purified
by dialysis and Q-Sepharose (Sigma) before equilibration in 50 mM
ammonium bicarbonate and stored at −80 °C. Soy embryos
were homogenized, and protein was isolated using 50 mM HEPES buffer.
SDS–PAGE samples were prepared by boiling several milligrams
of protein in sample buffer and running it on 4–12% Nu-PAGE
gel at constant voltage (200 V) for 35 min, and for amino acid analysis
the proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P, poly(vinylidene fluoride)
(PVDF) paper by electroblot for 2 h at 200 mA constant current (Supporting
Experimental Methods).

Amino Acid Hydrolysis and Analysis by GC/MS
Soybean
storage proteins excised from PVDF were hydrolyzed with 6 N HCl at
110 °C for 48 h, dried, and converted to tert-butyldimethylsilyl derivatives. Amino acids were suspended in acetonitrile
plus MTBSTFA for 30 min at room temperature followed by 100 °C
for 2 h. Amino acid isotopologues were analyzed by an ISQ GC/MS instrument
(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) operating in selected ion monitoring
mode (SIM) with a DB-5 column (30 × 0.25 mm i.d., Restek, Bellefonte,
PA) using a ramp profile of 100 °C for 4 min, then 100–200
°C at 4 °C/min, and then 200–300 °C at 10 °C/min
with a helium carrier gas flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. Injection, mass
spectrometer transfer line, and ion source temperatures were 230,
250, and 250 °C, respectively. Samples were run in triplicate.

Trypsin Digest and Peptide Preparation
Excised SDS–PAGE
bands were destained with 50% acetonitrile and 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate
for several hours, then reduced with 10 mM DTT, and alkylated with
iodoacetamide (55 mM in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate) at room temperature.
After being washed with ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile, the
protein was dried and trypsin digested as described in the Supporting Information (Experimental Methods).
The peptides were suspended in 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid prior
to mass spectrometry.

Orbital Trap Velos Mass Spectrometry
Peptides were
analyzed by LC–MS/MS using a nano-LC 2D (Eksigent, Dublin,
CA) coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San
Jose, CA). The instrument contained a trap column (C18 PepMap100,
300 μm × 1 mm, 5 μm, 100 Å, Thermo Fisher Scientific)
followed by an analytical column (Acclaim PepMap C18, 15 cm ×
75 μm × 3 μm, 100 Å, Thermo Fisher Scientific)
through which peptides were eluted at a rate of 260 nL/min. The gradient
changed from 98% buffer A (0.1% formic acid)/2% buffer B (0.1% formic
acid in 100% acetonitrile) after a 2 min hold period to 40% buffer
B in 83 min, followed by an increase to 2% buffer A/98% buffer B in
5 min and was held for an additional 2 min. The mass spectrometer
was operated in positive ionization mode, and survey scans were performed
in the FT cell in the range of 300–2000 m/z with the resolution set to 30–60000 at 400 m/z with additional operational parameters
described in the Supporting Information (Experimental Methods).

The Mascot Daemon v2.4 (Matrix Science)
data processing software with the NCBI database was used to evaluate
the peptides. The search parameters were as follows: trypsin-based
cleavage, two missed cleavage sites allowed, and methionine oxidation
allowed. The mass error tolerance for precursor ions was set to 15
ppm and 0.08 Da for fragment ions. Scaffold (version Scaffold_3.3.1,
Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate MS/MS-based
peptide and protein identifications.47 Peptide
identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater
than 80.0% probability as specified by the Peptide Prophet algorithm.48m/z values
were converted to molecular mases by accounting for the charge states.

Results and Discussion
Biomass Production and Culturing Conditions
for Steady-State
Isotopic Labeling of Proteins
E. coli was cultured in minimal M9 medium at 37 °C with or without 13C isotopes of glucose (∼7% uniformly labeled glucose,
NMR; Table S-1, Supporting Information).
Each culture was twice diluted into fresh medium during growth to
eliminate unlabeled biomass. Glucose was the sole source of organic
carbon provided to E. coli, and each
culture resulted in approximately 4 g of fresh weight biomass/L of
culture. Soybeans (G. max cv. Jack)
were grown in greenhouses maintained at approximately 23–30
°C with 14 h of daylight consistent with growth conditions in
St. Louis, MO. Immature pods were harvested and aseptically dissected,
and embryos were cultured with carbon and nitrogen sources to mimic in planta development as previously described.45,46,49 During a two week period of steady-state
labeling, the embryos accumulated 7.1 mg of dry weight per day, amounting
to approximately 4.1 doublings in the embryo biomass, which is equivalent
to 94% of the total biomass produced. Embryos were also cultured with
[U-13C6]glucose to provide a source of nonuniformly
labeled peptides. E. coli labeled protein
and labeled and unlabeled soybean biomass served as standards for
method development.

Evaluation of Peptides for LC–MS/MS
Peptide-Based Labeling
Analysis
Soybeans are approximately 40% protein by weight
and contain two major storage proteins, β-conglycinin and glycinin.50 Cultured embryos were harvested by centrifugation
and processed as a crude preparation or with subunit isolation by
SDS–PAGE. Protein subunits were digested with trypsin with
or without prior reduction and alkylation. Other proteases that produce
small peptides were less reliable and produced a limited number of
peptides (Table S-2, Supporting Information); however, further optimization of different cleavages could benefit
focused studies by providing additional peptide labeling descriptions.
The orbital trap was used to generate full scans that were analyzed
with protein assembly software (see the Experimental
Section). Three SDS–PAGE bands representing different
subunits of β-conglycinin were examined with the orbital trap
(Table S-3, Supporting Information). The
amino acid sequence and trypsin digestion pattern were used to calculate
the expected number of cleavages and the number of predicted peptides.
Identified and quantified peptides are described in Table S-4 (Supporting Information) and reflect the peptide
set that met the 95% quality score/confidence threshold setting. Peptides
greater than 35 amino acids exceeded the range of monitored masses.
GC/MS labeling in amino acids of different subunits is summarized
in Table S-5 (Supporting Information).
The labeling differences in the three storage protein subunits were
modest, and further quantification efforts of soybean protein focused
on the β-conglycinin subunit that gave the greatest number of
identified peptides (Table S-3). The ion chromatograms for each peptide
were identified using product ion fragmentation patterns and protein
assembly software. Intensities were manually extracted to quantify
the m/z intensity distributions
for both unlabeled and labeled peptides. A schematic overview of the
process is presented in Figure 1. Note that
for simplicity the increasing m/z has been indexed; for example, (m + 5)/z is subsequently referenced as “5”, and the
monoisotopic m/z is equivalent to
0.

Figure 1 Process for peptide evaluation by LC–MS/MS with the orbital
ion trap. Soybean or E. coli protein
that is 13C-labeled through culturing was purified and
separated by SDS–PAGE. Individual bands were reduced, alkylated,
and digested with trypsin prior to inspection by mass spectrometry.
Individual m/z values from peptides
containing natural abundance levels of isotopes were used with protein
assembly software to identify peptide sequences and retention times. 13C-enriched proteins were similarly processed, and peptides
were analyzed for labeling.

Details of the LC–MS/MS parameters are provided in
the Experimental Section. The m/z distributions of 53 unlabeled abundant peptides
were quantified
from a list generated by the protein assembly software. The unlabeled
peptides were compared to simulated m/z distributions generated from reported natural abundance levels51 and chemical composition. Each carbon in naturally
abundant peptides has an identical probability of 13C labeling.
The same holds true for the isotopes of all other elements, and we
simulated peptide mass distributions by successively convolving the
mass distributions of all constituent elements (i.e., carbon and heteroatoms).
The measured and simulated fractional abundances were similar (Figure 2) and indicated good agreement across abundances
ranging over several orders of magnitude (Table S-6, Supporting Information). Peptide charge did not impact label
quantification as indicated by a subset of 13 peptides measured with
charge states of both 2 and 3. Oxidized and nonoxidized forms of peptides
that contained methionine were also similar, indicating good technical
agreement (Figure 2); however, the m/z separation of oxidized/nonoxidized
peptides is small (i.e., 16 Da), and we investigated if this could
reduce the isotopic envelope width that we could quantify.

Figure 2 Technical comparison
of direct orbital trap peptide fractional
abundances to simulated measurements of natural abundance. (A) Comparison
of 53 peptides reveals a strong linear relation at all relative abundances.
(B) A subset of 13 peptides were present at multiple charge states.
The fractional abundances were not affected by the charge. (C) Similarly,
the presence of methionine and oxidized methionine did not impact
the fractional abundance quantification.

Given that sulfur-containing amino acids are often present
at lower
concentrations in some plant tissues and that they can be degraded
during protein hydrolysis (i.e., cysteine), they are frequently not
reported; however, we further evaluated the presence of cysteine and
methionine in peptides identified by protein assembly software. In
all instances cysteine residues were carboxymethylated (Table S-7a, Supporting Information), reflecting the quantitative
reduction and alkylation by dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide.52 The analysis of methionine-containing peptides
(Table S-7b and associated description) indicated that oxidized peptides
do not coelute with nonoxidized forms. The difference in retention
times usually approached 1 min or more and allowed for completely
independent inspection of m/z values
(Table S-7b). In summary, the analysis of both soybean protein and E. coli biomass indicated (i) cysteine residues are
quantitatively reduced and alkylated so that only the reduced forms
were observed in peptides (Table S-7a) and (ii) peptides containing
methionine or oxidized methionine were chromatographically resolved
(Table S-7b); therefore, cysteine- and methionine-containing isotopologues
can be quantified without concern. Additionally, mass resolution did
not markedly alter the number of measurable elements of the m/z distributions or the average labeling
description (Table S-8, Supporting Information).

Quantification of Orbital Trap Mass Distributions
To
optimize the quality of the m/z quantification, m/z intensity distributions over a range
of scans were included. Due to the incidental absence of lower intensity m/z elements from the distribution, simple
integration of intensities over several scans results in overestimations
of abundant elements. By scaling intensity values to the base peak
of each scan, good quantification can be achieved, but the precision
is still compromised by the contribution of both the variation of
the base peak and the variation in the m/z values that are scaled. The significance of this effect
is inversely proportional to the relative intensity of the base peak,
and because the base peak will have only a modest intensity in significantly
labeled peptides, a better approach is to normalize by the sum of
all m/z elements. This requires
all m/z elements to be present in
all scans, yet missing values in orbital trap spectra is common for
signals that are close to the limit of detection (Figure 3) and also occurs sporadically for peaks with significant
intensities.53 To overcome this limitation,
the m/z distribution and the total
peptide intensities of each scan were fitted to the observed m/z measurements. The optimization problem
was nonlinear due to the multiplication of the total ion intensity
parameters of each scan with the elements of the m/z distribution. This gap-filling procedure was
overdetermined and solved with the Matlab optimization function “fmincon”.

ion chromatograms (EICs) of peptide VLFSR from 13C-labeled
soybeans. (A) EICs are colored for scans within the full
width at half-height of the total extracted isotopologue chromatogram,
which was used for quantification. The EIC of mass trace 12 (monoisotopic m/z + 12/z) was only present
in a subset of the scans (arrow). (B) Quantification of the EICs:
5, 7, and 9 are presented with scaling to the base m/z peak (+) or through nonlinear fitting (○).
The dotted line indicates the mean fractional abundances.

Estimation of Orbital Trap Measurement Standard
Deviations
The total population of peptide molecules was
assumed to be significantly
larger than the population observed by the orbital trap, so that the
measurements could be modeled as a multinomial distribution that was
sampled with replacement. The orbital trap signal was converted into
ion counts by substituting raw signal-to-noise values using the following
approximate relationship:54Ii = SiK(R/R0)1/2/Nizi, where Si/Ni is the signal-to-noise ratio, K is the noise
band, zi is the charge, R is the acquisition resolution, and R0 is the reference resolution. Each m/z distribution contains a discrete number of elements q (m/z values), and each
sampling event results in drawing an m/z element. The total number of ions of a peptide in the orbital trap
in a scan establishes the sample size, n, where n = ∑i = 0qIi, and the fraction of each m/z element (i) relative to all m/z isotopologues is given by pi. The multinomial sample mean and variance
for each m/z element are npi and npi(1 – pi), respectively. It follows that the variance of
the multinomial distribution scales with the signal intensity (linear
with n) and that the standard deviation scales with
the root of the signal intensity. The standard deviations for the m/z measurements were computed from the
multinomial variance. For comparison, the standard deviations were
also determined empirically from the residuals of the scans (Figure 4). The relationship between the standard deviations
expected from the multinomial sampling and the observed standard deviations
was highly correlated (R2 = 0.92). The
standard deviations that were calculated from the multinomial probability
were smaller than the measured values (slope of 1.32), but scaled
linearly. The slope value >1 indicated that the calculated ion
count
consistently overestimated the actual ion count and therefore underestimated
the associated standard deviations. Because approximately 30 independent
measurements are required to reliably estimate standard deviations,
the multinomial standard deviations determined were used in combination
with the observed regression relationship (Figure 4) to estimate more precise standard deviations.

Figure 4 Observed standard
deviations as a function of the multinomial sampling
standard deviation. The multinomial sampling error closely approximated
(correlation coefficient R2 of 0.92) and
was linearly related (slope of 1.32) to the empirically determined
standard deviations. This relationship was used to infer standard
deviations for ion intensity measurements from the calculated multinomial
sampling error.

Quantitative Validation
of Mass Distributions
To quantitatively
test if orbital trap m/z distributions
faithfully represented the relative ion abundances of peptides, observed
ion abundances were compared to simulated mass distributions through
χ2 evaluation. The residuum for the χ2 test was ∑ijnj(mfij – pij)2/pij(1 – pij), where nj was the total ion count of peptide j. First the natural abundances of isotopes in proteins
were measured and compared to simulated distributions (Figure 5A). In a naturally abundant sample each carbon in
a peptide has an identical probability of being 13C; therefore,
peptide mass distributions can be predicted by successively convolving
the isotopic mass distributions of all constituent atoms, carbons
and heteroatoms alike. A larger range of m/z elements was considered through the evaluation of 7% uniformly
labeled protein (Figure 5B). The mean carbon
atom percent enrichment for the 7% labeled protein was calculated
from the MS data prior to generation of the simulated peptide mass
distributions (Table S-9, Supporting Information), and the labeling in fed glucose was verified using NMR (Table
S-1, Supporting Information). The 7% E. coli labeled peptides passed the χ2 test, indicating that they were not significantly different from
the simulated distributions (p > 0.05), whereas
the
predicted m/z distribution for natural
abundance was statistically different from the measured values. The
discrepancy between the results for the 7% labeled and naturally abundant
peptide sets may be due to the lower relative intensities of the m/z elements in the 7% spectra (i.e., the
peptide signal is spread over more m/z elements). The lower intensities reduced the difference between
predicted and observed values (relative to the associated standard
deviations) so that the differences may not have been statistically
significant. We further investigated if the orbital trap distribution
contained a sensitivity bias toward lower or higher m/z values by inspecting the residuals of the combined m/z distributions (Figure 6). The 7% labeled peptides were aligned by their mean mass
values so that the x-coordinate in Figure 6 represented the difference between the m/z under consideration and the mean m/z for that entire peptide envelope. For
each m/z element the simulated ion
count was compared to the measured value and plotted as a relative
error (simulated – measured)/measured. The correlation coefficient
for the residuals of the 7% labeled distribution was 0.00319, which
was not significant (p = 0.3056). The residuals showed
some structure, which suggested that the strongest intensities may
be slightly overestimated.

Figure 5 Comparison of peptide labeling. Peptides containing
naturally abundant
levels of isotopes (A) or those uniformly labeled by culturing E. coli (B) were measured by orbital trap (black
bars) and compared to simulated mass distributions (gray bars). The
estimated standard deviations are represented on the simulated data.
Due to strong signal intensity of the selected natural abundant peptides,
the standard deviations on the simulated data are barely visible.
The m/z values are indexed similarly
to those in Figure 3 (e.g., an index of 10
represents the monoisotopic m/z +
10/z).

Figure 6 Relative accuracy of m/z intensities.
Possible m/z-dependent intensity
bias of by the orbital trap measurements was assessed on the 7% labeled
peptide set. The mean mass for each isotopologue envelope was determined
and assigned a mass deviation of zero. Each intensity was compared
to the expected (simulated) value, with the difference between the
two scaled by the peak size. The relative errors were plotted against
the centered mass deviations for each m/z value (m/z – mean peptide m/z). The plotted trend line suggested
no mass-dependent bias, and the R2 value
was not significant.

Comparison of Orbital Trap Measurements to Convolved GC/MS Measurements
To evaluate how orbital trap peptide mass estimates compare to
GC/MS-determined amino acid mass distribution measurements, amino
acid mass distributions were convolved to simulate peptides (Figure 7). First, GC/MS amino acid measurement methods were
extended to include the entire carbon backbone for each amino acid,
and the accuracy of the fragments was considered by inspection of
natural abundance (Table S-10, Supporting Information). Protein labeled with [U-13C6]glucose was
extracted from soybeans and measured by orbital trap as well as hydrolyzed,
derivatized, and measured by GC/MS (Table S-11, Supporting Information). The GC/MS values were convolved to
simulate peptides for comparison to orbital trap data. Although the
mean mass estimates for the distributions were often similar, the
simulated distributions from GC/MS data did not match the orbital
trap data. The disparity was interpreted to be due to unlabeled peptides
present at the start of the culturing period. The unlabeled material
is visible in the lower mass range of peptides (Figure 7). Because the GC/MS data were not separated into a naturally
abundant and labeled population of amino acids, the convolution of
the amino acid distributions was in fact the convolution of the summed
amino acid distributions, whereas the orbital trap data represented
the summed peptide distributions. Consequently, the GC/MS measurements
overestimate the center masses of the peptide distribution and underestimate
the extreme masses, both the low and high masses. To compare the precision
of both technologies, 1000 Monte Carlo samplings of the GC/MS mass
estimates were convolved using the 1% technical error associated with
the GC/MS measurements as the standard deviation. The standard deviations
associated with the orbital trap distributions were estimated using
multinomial sampling as before (Figure 7).
The simulation suggested that GC/MS distribution estimates can be
expected to be very precise, but less accurate. This has important
implications for 13C metabolic flux analysis. The significant
presence of a naturally abundant protein fraction has been recognized
before and is fitted in some flux analysis studies.55,56

Figure 7 Comparison
of convolved GC/MS amino acid measurements to labeled
peptide measurements determined by orbital trap. Three peptides obtained
from soybean embryos cultured in [13C]glucose are presented.
The convolved GC/MS data (gray bars) fail to faithfully describe two
time points in metabolic development: growth on the plant and growth
in culture. The separate biological processes result in two peptide
descriptions that are overlapping but bimodal as most clearly indicated
in the first peptide comparison. Direct measurement of peptides by
orbital trap maintains the distinction between the two distributions
(black bars). The m/z values are
indexed as in Figure 5.

Conclusions
This work affirmed the quantification capabilities
of high-resolution
orbital trap mass spectrometers. The relative peptide m/z intensity distributions closely matched simulated
distributions for the investigated conditions. m/z distributions were carefully quantified in such a fashion
that missing orbital trap data did not bias the quantification. To
establish precise estimates of standard deviations on the orbital
trap measurements, the raw signal-to-noise data were converted into
absolute ion counts. The multinomial sample standard deviation mapped
well to the empirically observed standard deviation, and this relationship
was exploited to improve estimates of standard deviations for individual
measurements. The developed quantification technology was used to
test if the observed m/z values
differed significantly from the simulated distributions. Although
naturally abundant peptides did differ statistically from the simulated
distribution, the differences were very small. m/z distributions of 7% uniformly labeled peptides did not
differ significantly from the simulated distributions, and relative
intensities within peptides revealed no significant mass bias. Overall,
the results indicate that the orbital trap measured m/z distributions were faithful, unbiased representations
of the true peptide mass distributions. Compared to peptides generated
by convolving GC/MS-derived measurements, peptide-based data have
the distinct advantage of encoding the spatial and temporal information
associated with the protein from which they were derived. In addition,
the unlabeled (original) peptide fraction can be readily recognized,
which has the potential to improve flux estimation and to be used
for simultaneous protein turnover measurements.
