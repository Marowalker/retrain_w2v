Photoinduced electron
transfer (PET), which causes pH-dependent
quenching of fluorescent dyes, is more effectively introduced by phenolic
groups than by amino groups which have been much more commonly used
so far. That is demonstrated by fluorescence measurements involving
several classes of fluorophores. Electrochemical measurements show
that PET in several amino-modified dyes is thermodynamically favorable,
even though it was not experimentally found, underlining the importance
of kinetic aspects to the process. Consequently, the attachment of
phenolic groups allows for fast and simple preparation of a wide selection
of fluorescent pH-probes with tailor-made spectral properties, sensitive
ranges, and individual advantages, so that a large number of applications
can be realized. Fluorophores carrying phenolic groups may also be
used for sensing analytes other than pH or molecular switching and
signaling.

Rational
dye design is a key
concept in molecular recognition, (super)molecular signaling, and
optoelectronics. “Modules” capable of a certain function
such as interacting with an analyte1 (pH,
cations, carbon dioxide, glucose, or complex biomolecules like proteins),
molecular switching,2−4 or charge generation5,6 are attached
to or integrated into a chromophore. Photoinduced electron transfer
(PET)7−9 is a process that can enable all of these processes.
A functional group capable of introducing PET (the “PET group”)
undergoes a redox process involving the excited state (but not the
ground state) of a chromophore. In fluorescent dyes, this results
in fluorescence quenching. The process is fast and reversible. The
charge separation implied is thus short-lived but can be taken advantage
of in photovoltaics.

In this work, we focus on fluorescent dyes
suitable for pH-sensing
(“probes”). We also aim to provide insights into the
PET process in general which may be helpful for the design of dyes
and materials applying PET for other purposes. PET-based fluorescent
probes and sensors have been presented mostly for recognizing ions10−14 but also for measuring pH.15−19 Those probes and sensors are of great potential for application
in diagnostics, life sciences, environmental analytics, or industrial
process control.20 In most PET-based probes,
fluorescence quenching is caused by an alkylamino group. Upon protonation
of the amine or interaction with a cation, PET can be impeded or prevented,
which results in fluorescence enhancement. Consequently, there is
pH-response affiliated with the protonation of the amine, thus characterized
by the corresponding pKA value, with a
usual sensitive pH-range of pKA ±
1.5. Phenoxide groups can act in exactly the same way, as was first
demonstrated by Gareis et al. by means of a phenol-modified boron-dipyrromethene
(BODIPY) dye.21 So far, only a few examples
of pH-probes carrying phenolic PET groups have been presented, most
of which are BODIPY dyes.22−27 On the other hand, in many fluorescent pH-probes, phenolic groups
are fully integrated into the chromophore, for instance in fluoresceins.
Those are not true PET probes since the redox properties of the chromophore
itself are strongly pH-dependent, even though PET may play a significant
role in some.28,29

Here we present, for the
first time, a comparison between fluorescent
pH-probes carrying phenolic PET groups and those bearing amines on
the basis of various fluorophores. It is demonstrated that halogenated
phenoxide groups are generally more effective quenchers than amines,
and they open the way to alternative strategies for designing fluorescent
probes. Because many phenol derivatives are commercially available,
and they can be attached to numerous dyes by simple reactions, probes
with tailored properties are available in a convenient way. Their
spectral properties, sensitive ranges, and stabilities can be selected
to meet the variable and demanding requirements of life sciences and
diagnostics.

Results and Discussion
Several dye classes with very different
spectral and structural
properties (Figures 1 and 2 and Table 1) have been selected for
this work, including xanthenes (fluoresceins and sulforhodamines),
diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrroles (DPPs), and perylene
bisimides (PBIs). To introduce PET, both halogenated (o-chloro and o,o-dichloro) phenols and tertiary amines
have been attached. Because PET is affected by (de)protonation in
both groups, fluorescence pH-calibration has been selected as the
primary evaluation method of the PET process. Calibration was carried
out in mixtures of ethanol and aqueous buffer [1/1 (v/v)], to provide
sufficient solubility for all the investigated dyes which include
both water-soluble and highly hydrophobic structures. To further suppress
any potential aggregation and other effects perturbing the fluorescence
measurement (dimerization, self-quenching), calibration was performed
in a highly dilute (from 6 × 10–8 to 2 ×
10–6 M) solution. For all dyes, effects of buffer
pH on maxima and shape of both absorption and fluorescence spectra
were absent or negligible (≤3 nm), emphasizing the absence
of major pH-dependent effects other than PET. Only data measured in
acidic solution is thus stated in Table 1.

Quenching caused by PET at basic
pH was significantly stronger
for the dyes carrying phenolic groups (dyes 1–6 A,B) than for those bearing amines (dyes 1–6 C,D) (Figure 3 and Table 2). Indeed, quenching was almost complete for DPPs 3A,B and PBIs 5A,B and 6A, while
it was partial for 5D and absent for 3C and 6D. For xanthene (FLUO, RHOD) dyes,
there was partial quenching by phenolic groups (dyes 1B, 2A), but no quenching by amino groups (dyes 1C, 2C) was found. Note that even though PET
is often associated with on–off fluorescence quenching,8 partial quenching by PET is not uncommon for
some systems in certain environments.33 For ClPBI dyes (4) which are intermediates
in the preparation of PhOPBI (5) we previously
found strong quenching by amines.31 For 4A,B, we found fluorescent signals undistinguishable from
background both at acidic and basic pH. A possible reason is strong
quenching by both the phenolic and phenoxide form. In contrast to
all other investigated dyes, the probe 1B shows two dynamic
ranges; it shows a strong fluorescence increase from pH 3 to pH 6
and moderate fluorescence quenching at basic pH (Figure 3). This behavior is explained by formation of a colorless
lactone in acidic environment and is typical for fluoresceins bearing
a carboxyl group in the 2′ position of the phenyl ring.34 The behavior
of 1B and 1C in the acidic pH range is virtually
identical.

buffer mixture [1:1 (v/v), ionic strength of 100 mM] modified with
phenolic (1–6 A,B) and amine (1–6
C,D) PET groups. Dye concentrations are stated in Experimental Section.

All pH-probes are synthetically easily accessible, FLUO, RHOD, and DPP dyes (1–3) via a single step, PBIs (4–6) via two simple steps. In
particular, the xanthene-based
probes were prepared from commercially available dyes (Lissamine rhodamine
B and 5(6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein NHS ester;
the latter was synthesized for this work but is also commercially
available at a comparatively low cost) under mild conditions (see
Figure 2; because the lengthy synthetic section
is exclusively based on standard methods, detailed description is
included only in the Supporting Information). These and many other dyes, which have been designed to perform
bioconjugation, are widely commercially available and easy to handle
as “kits”. In this way, pH-probes with selectable spectral
properties are easily accessible also to the synthetically inexperienced
user. This work clearly emphasizes that phenolic PET groups are better
suited for creating a selection of new pH-probes since they can be
combined with a significantly larger number of fluorophores to yield
PET-based probes. The phenol-based probes presented here cover a wide
range (excitable at 400–660 nm, emissive at 500–750
nm, Figure 4) of the visible spectrum. They
feature individual advantages so that many applications can be addressed
with them. For example, the xanthenes 1B and 2A are very bright and compatible with light sources and filters widely
used in fluorescence microscopy. Both feature sensitivity at near-neutral
pH, and good photostability is common for rhodamines and dichlorofluoresceins,
in contrast to nonchlorinated fluoresceins.351B is an example for a probe featuring two sensitive
ranges and can therefore be applied for measuring both near-neutral
and acidic pH. Advantages of the other dye classes have been discussed
in previous publications, as listed in Table 1.

Since many halogenated phenols with different substitution
patterns
are commercially available, it is possible to select the pKA value of the resulting pH-probe and thus its
sensitive range. For instance, the di- and monochlorinated phenolic
groups presented here are useful for slightly acidic and neutral to
slightly basic values, respectively. The similar pKA values for fluorophores featuring very different structure
and hydrophilicity (Table 2) underline that
the sensitive range can be selected beforehand to match the pH range
of interest. In fact, the pKa values for
the 2,6-dichlorophenol-subsituted dyes (A series) are
in the range of 5.8–6.3, whereas the pKa values for the 2-monochlorophenol-substituted dyes (B series) vary from 7.7 to 8.3. These values are slightly
lower than for the corresponding free 2,6-dichlorophenol (pKa = 6.8)36 and 2-chlorophenol
(pKa = 8.5),37 which can be explained by an electron-withdrawing character of the
carboxamnido (1B), sulfonamido (2A, 3A, 3B), and imide (5A, 5B, 6A) groups located in the para position with respect
to the hydroxyl group.

Phenolic PET groups can be associated
with pH-probes bearing neutral/anionic
charge at acidic/basic pH, while amino groups rather come with cationic/neutral
charge. This implies different interactions with the environment (e.g.,
biomolecules present in biological applications), underlining that
phenolic groups may provide a reasonable alternative, even in combination
with fluorophores which are effectively quenched by amines. It should
be considered that the cell-penetration properties of the dyes are
significantly affected by their charge and therefore some of the anionic
probes may not be suitable for intracellular measurements. However,
other strategies can be used to ensure cell-penetration (e.g., by
incorporating the dyes inside silica or polymeric nanoparticles).38 For example, efficient passive cell loading
was previously reported for cationic oxygen-sensitive nanoparticles39 and applicability of such materials for intracellular
pH sensing is currently being investigated in our group.

in this work covering the entire visible range and additionally including
near-infrared emission (AmPBI dyes). Example spectra
for RHOD, DPP, and ClPBI dyes
(2–4 A–D) are not shown for the sake of
clarity.

Probes carrying phenolic PET groups
are not limited to pH-sensing
but are also potentially useful for measuring carbon dioxide and ions.
The sensitivity in most optical carbon dioxide probes is affiliated
with the protonation of a phenoxide group40,41 and PET-based indicators (mostly based on amines, so far) have been
widely applied for optical sensing of metal cations.10,12,42

Because PET is a quenching
process, we expected that fluorophores
subject to PET may feature shorter fluorescence decay times in their
basic forms than in their acidic forms, which are not affected by
PET. While decay times are not expected to be pH-dependent in the
case of complete quenching since the decay time of the basic form
is not measurable, we anticipated that a shorter decay time should
be detectable for dyes undergoing partial quenching. This is in agreement
with our experimental findings for 1B and 5D, indicating that PET is a quenching process that diminishes both
fluorescence intensity and decay time. For 2A, a biexponential
decay curve was found in basic solution and a diminishment in decay
time could not be verified, indicating that in this case there may
be more than just two species contributing to the decay times. Still,
pH-probes undergoing partial quenching by PET are potentially very
useful for quantitative pH measurement and imaging as they enable
decay time readout and do not require further referencing.

The free enthalpy of the PET process, ΔGQ,PET, is given by Weller’s equation:7 1  Eox,rec is the
first oxidation potential of the PET group (receptor), Ered,flu the first reduction potential of fluorophore,
ΔEexc,flu the singlet excitation
energy of the fluorophore, and EIP the
ion pairing energy. Consequently, PET will be observed if the PET
group is easily oxidized and the fluorophore is easily reduced and
absorbs at short wavelengths.9,16,43 PET is also more favorable in polar solvents.44 Kinetic aspects can play a significant role, in particular,
PET becomes less effective with increasing distance between fluorophore
and the PET group and an adverse nature and orientation of molecular
orbitals may inhibit the process.45−47 Nevertheless, these
thermodynamic considerations generally enable a valuable estimation
whether a PET process will take place and are suitable for identifying
systems in which PET is impossible.

We therefore measured the
redox potentials of fluorophores and
PET groups to determine ΔGQ,PET (Table 3, measurement curves shown in the Supporting Information). Model compounds for fluorophore and
PET group were used in some cases, as listed in Table 3 and discussed in the following.

In accordance
with the method used by DeSilva and co-workers,16 model compounds available at low cost and with
presumably very similar photo- and electrochemical properties were
measured for most fluorophores. Singlet excitation energies were calculated
as intersection wavelengths between fluorescence excitation and emission
spectra as outlined by Ford et al.48 For
the ion pairing energy, the value of 0.1 can be assumed.16,49 The redox potentials of the PET groups may be estimated measuring
those of amines and chlorophenoxide or p-aminochlorophenoxide
ions. However, since in most of the obtained indicators, the PET groups
are located closely to electron-withdrawing groups (imide, sulfonamide,
and carboxamide), we decided to use 5A,B,D as model compounds.
All measurement curves are shown in the Supporting
Information. The oxidation potential found for the basic form
of 5A (0.708 V) is indeed higher than the one of 2,6-dichlorophenol
(0.56 V, irreversible oxidation) and significantly higher than the
one of 4-amino-2,6-dichlorophenol (−0.09 V, reversible oxidation
which may originate from amine rather than phenoxide oxidation). Using 5A,B, in which the phenoxide groups are substituted by strongly
electron-withdrawing imide groups, as model compounds should prevent
an overestimation of the thermodynamic driving force for PET since
the phenoxide groups in 1–4 A,B and 6A are not expected to feature significantly lower electron densities.
In 5D, the oxidation potential cannot be reliably determined
due to background oxidation, which complicates readout at >0.8
V.
The value for triethylamine (0.82 V) was used instead. The true oxidation
potentials of the indicators may be higher due to the presence of
β-nitrogen atoms carrying electron-withdrawing substituents.
Estimation with β-substituted model compounds (tetramethyldiaminoethane
and dimethylaminoethanol), showed oxidation at only slightly lower
voltage (0.85 and 0.87 V, respectively, irreversible; the values were
obtained considering a blank sample to account for background oxidation,
as shown in the Supporting Information).
Even in case calculated ΔGQ,PET values
are slightly too negative, positive values seem very unrealistic (note
that amine oxidation potentials as high as 1.2–1.6 V would
be required to make PET thermodynamically unfavorable for all of 1–6 C,D).

Consequently, for all indicators, PET
has been estimated to be
thermodynamically favorable, even for the amines which experimentally
showed no PET (1–3C, 6D). Hence,
even though the smaller thermodynamic driving force for PET may play
a role in the much lower efficiency of the PET process observed with
amines, it does not seem convincing as the sole explanation. Kinetic
aspects probably play an additional role, and indeed, we had previously
found highly effective PET both for rhodamines50 and 1-aminoperylene bisimides32 carrying amino groups in different positions than those investigated
in this work. Thus, we present here another example for how the PET
process can be influenced by structural parameters. Effective PET
requires certain proximity between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO
of the acceptor, which may be easier to realize with phenoxide systems.
Note that amino groups usually require a minimum spacer length of
two atoms if attached by the easy-to-use techniques presented in this
work. A single-carbon spacer would result in aminal structures which
are unstable.

Materials and Methods
1,6,7,12-Tetrachloroperylene-3,4:9,10-tetracarboxylic
bisanhydride was purchased from Beijing Wenhaiyang Industry and Traiding
Co. Ltd. (http://china.zhaoteng.com), 1,4-diketo-3,6-diphenylpyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (Irgazin Scarlet) from Kremer Pigmente (http://kremer-pigmente.de/en). The preparation of Cl-DAPBI and DPP-MonoSA is published elsewhere.31,51 MOP3Cl-DAPBI was prepared according to a procedure described previously.32 1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone was from ABCR (www.abcr.de), and chlorophenols were from TCI Europe (www.tcichemicals.com). Deuterated solvents were obtained from Eurisotop (www.eurisotop.com), silica gel from Acros (www.fishersci.com), and solvents
used for column chromatography from VWR (www.vwr.at). Inorganic
salts were supplied by Carl Roth (www.roth.de). All other
chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich (www.sigmaaldrich.com).

Absorption measurements were performed on a Cary 50 UV–vis
spectrophotometer from Varian (www.varianinc.com). Dye
concentration was 2 μM for 1 and 2; 5 μM for 4 and 5; and 10 μM
for 3 and 6. Fluorescence spectra were recorded
on a Fluorolog3 spectrofluorimeter (www.horiba.com). Fluorescence
decay times were determined using a time-correlated single photon
counting technique on a Fluorolog3 spectrometer equipped with a NanoLED
455 nm laser diode. Decay curves were subjected to monoexponential
fit using DAS6 supplied by the manufacturer. Dye concentration was
0.05 μM for 1, 2, and 5; 0.3 μM
for 3; and 2 μM for 6.

Relative
fluorescence quantum yields were determined using rhodamine
101, rhodamine B, and Nile Red as standards (quantum yields 0.96,
0.65,52 and 0.2753 in ethanol, respectively). NMR spectra were recorded on a 300 MHz
instrument (Bruker) in CDCl3 with TMS as a standard. MALDI-TOF
mass spectra were recorded on a Micromass TofSpec 2E. The spectra
were taken in reflectron mode at an accelerating voltage of +20 kV.

The pH of the buffer solutions (phosphate, acetate, and TRIS) was
controlled by a digital pH meter (Seven Easy, Mettler Toledo, www.mt.com) calibrated at 25 °C with standard buffers
of pH 7.0 and 4.0 (WTW GmbH & Co. KG, www.wtw.com).
The buffers were adjusted to constant ionic strength using sodium
chloride as the background electrolyte.

Electrochemical measurements
were performed using a VMP3 electrochemical
workstation (Biologic) and a multinecked, airtight glass cell. The
measurements were carried out at room temperature. A 1 mm diameter
glassy carbon disk (BAS Inc.) was employed as the working electrodes.
Prior to use, the working electrode was polished with a 0.05 μm
alumina slurry in water and rinsed with copious amounts of water and
ethanol followed by drying. A platinum wire served as the counter
electrode. Measurements were performed using a Ag/AgCl reference electrode
(BAS Inc.). Electrolytes were saturated with Ar prior to the measurements. E1/2 was determined from the peak potentials
for quasi-reversible processes. For irreversible processes, the E1/2 was estimated from the half peak potential
Ep/2 via E1/2 = Ep/2 – 1.09 RT/nF.54

Calibration
The following sigmoidal
function was used
for sensor calibration: 2  where I is fluorescence intensity
and Amax and Amin, and are numerical coefficients.

Syntheses
All
dyes presented in this work were obtained
by established procedures, as summarized in Figure 2. A detailed description is available in the Supporting Information.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have demonstrated that employing phenolic groups,
pH-probes derived from a wide range of fluorophores can be created.
They feature selectable sensitive pH ranges, spectral properties,
and individual advantages that can be chosen to meet the requirements
of many particular applications. In particular, phenolic groups allow
higher flexibility than the much more commonly used amines as they
can quench many fluorophores due to photoinduced electron transfer
(PET) at basic pH, which are not quenched by amines. Unlike amines,
they do not introduce positive charge into the molecule. The probes
are accessible via simple reactions similar to those common in bioconjugation
chemistry, which makes the concept applicable for a wide research
field, without requiring a profound expertise in synthetic organic
chemistry. Fluorophores carrying phenolic PET groups are not limited
to pH sensing but can be applied for the numerous other application
possibilities affiliated with PET, such as ion sensing, molecular
switching, and signaling or organic electronics.
