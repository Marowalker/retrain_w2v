Cell-to-cell
variability and functional heterogeneity are integral
features of multicellular organisms. Chemical classification of cells
into cell type is important for understanding cellular specialization
as well as organismal function and organization. Assays to elucidate
these chemical variations are best performed with single cell samples
because tissue homogenates average the biochemical composition of
many different cells and oftentimes include extracellular components.
Several single cell microanalysis techniques have been developed but
tend to be low throughput or require preselection of molecular probes
that limit the information obtained. Mass spectrometry (MS) is an
untargeted, multiplexed, and sensitive analytical method that is well-suited
for studying chemically complex individual cells that have low analyte
content. In this work, populations of cells from the rat pituitary,
the rat pancreatic islets of Langerhans, and from the Aplysia californica nervous system, are classified
using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (MALDI) MS by their peptide content. Cells were dispersed
onto a microscope slide to generate a sample where hundreds to thousands
of cells were separately located. Optical imaging was used to determine
the cell coordinates on the slide, and these locations were used to
automate the MS measurements to targeted cells. Principal component
analysis was used to classify cellular subpopulations. The method
was modified to focus on the signals described by the lower principal
components to explore rare cells having a unique peptide content.
This approach efficiently uncovers and classifies cellular subtypes
as well as discovers rare cells from large cellular populations.

==== Body
Cell-to-cell chemical variability
and heterogeneity are fundamental features of multicellular organisms.
Cells have historically been classified by their morphology and localization
within an organism. However, a cell’s chemical content can
also suggest cellular function and specialization. Further, even within
supposedly homogeneous cell populations, chemical heterogeneities
can be observed due to a variety of endogenous and exogenous factors.
Although chemical analyses of cells are often conducted on tissue
homogenates, these assays may be less useful for cell classification
because homogenization typically mixes many cell types as well as
extracellular materials. Signals from rare cells can also be missed
because their unique chemical content is diluted during homogenization.
Single cell chemical analysis is therefore important for categorizing
individual cells based on their chemical content. As a recent example,
single cell transcriptomics uncovered molecularly distinct cellular
classes in the cortex and the hippocampus, demonstrating the value
of single cell analysis for molecular cellular classification.1

Beyond the transcriptome, there also have
been many advances in
single cell metabolomics and peptidomics analyses, often using mass
spectrometry (MS) and different separation methods.2−4 The nontargeted
and multiplexed nature of mass spectrometric methods makes them useful
for single cell characterization but many are serial approaches. Consequently,
the required separation times and sampling processes have restricted
investigations to relatively few cells,3,5−7 thereby limiting capabilities for categorizing populations of cells.
Higher throughput methods have been developed. Mass cytometry, for
example, enables classification of immune cell types based on a panel
of markers,8 but the reliance on molecular
probes requires a priori knowledge of the cellular chemical content
and restricts the number of analytical channels available per analysis.
Another high throughput approach, microarray MS, uses arrays of hydrophilic
wells surrounded by an omniphobic material, depositing one to a few
cells into each well,4 and has been used
to study metabolites from single cell organisms like algae and yeast.9,10 Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is another option that can obtain
thousands of spectra from tissues,11−14 although MSI has yet to be demonstrated
for high-throughput single cell profiling.

In this work, we
scale up single cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
(MALDI) MS to enable label-free mass spectrometric categorization
of cells in endocrine systems based on their peptide profiles. We
analyzed a variety of endocrine and nervous system cell types, including
cells from the rat pituitary and pancreatic islets of Langerhans,
and the Aplysia californica central
nervous system. These systems were chosen because there is detailed
information on the peptide content of these cells, and we have extensive
experience working with these cell types,3,5,7 important factors in allowing the efficacy
of our approach to be evaluated. The analysis begins by spreading
a population of fluorescently labeled, intact cells onto a microscope
slide so that the cells are randomly distributed. The population is
optically imaged, and the cell coordinates are determined. The coordinates
are then used to automate the MALDI-TOF MS analysis to target the
individual cell or cells of interest. This approach is a refinement
of the stretched sample method, in which MSI, or profiling, is conducted
on tissue samples that are placed on an array of beads embedded on
a Parafilm substrate and analyzed via MALDI MS.15−18 A similar approach has also been
used for laser ablation electrospray ionization MSI.19 Instead of analyzing tissues or tissues on beads, here
we focused on determining distinct subpopulations of cells based on
their peptide profiles. Although a cell population prepared in this
way can also be analyzed via traditional MSI, this targeted approach
greatly reduces data size and complexity, and improves the quality
of the data as MS acquisitions are only from the cells of interest
(and not from cellular debris or other features).

Along with
optimizing the data collection process, we also worked
on effective data mining. A challenge in analyzing single cell data
sets involves finding both the major and minor patterns that characterize
cell populations. We conducted principal component analysis (PCA)
and PCA-based outlier detection, enabling identification of subpopulations
and rare cells. Using this data collection and analysis method, we
profiled the peptide content of populations of hundreds to thousands
of cells, classifying multiple cell types within the pituitary and
pancreas, as well as revealing several rare cells having a unique
cellular content.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
All
chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO), unless noted otherwise.

Sample Preparation
Details for the Aplysia neuronal samples
are provided in the Supporting
Information. The pituitary and islets of Langerhans cellular
populations were extracted from male Sprague–Dawley outbred
rats (Rattus norvegicus, 2.5–3
months-old; Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN). Animals were housed
on a 12 h light cycle and fed ad libitum. Euthanasia was performed
in accordance with the protocols established by the University of
Illinois Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and in accordance
with all state and federal regulations for the humane care and treatment
of animals.

For pituitary isolation, rats were sacrificed by
decapitation using a guillotine. The pituitaries were immediately
surgically removed and placed into ∼2 mL of ice cold Modified
Gey’s balanced salt solution (mGBSS) containing 1.5 mM CaCl2, 4.9 mM KCl, 0.2 mM KH2PO4, 11 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM MgSO4, 138 mM NaCl, 27.7 mM NaHCO3, 0.8 mM NaH2PO4, and 25 mM HEPES dissolved
in Milli-Q water (Millipore, Billerica, MA), with the pH adjusted
to 7.2 using NaOH in Milli-Q water. Enzymatic treatment was done in
an mGBSS solution containing 1% trypsin and 0.2% collagenase at 37
°C for 20 min, followed by 5 min incubation in mGBSS containing
1% trypsin, and another 5 min in 0.2% collagenase and 5 mg/mL of DNase
I (Boehringer-Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) dissolved in mGBSS. Finally,
the sample was washed with and kept for 30–180 min in a mixture
containing 33% glycerol and 67% mGBSS. The cell nucleus was stained
by adding 10 μL of 1 mg/mL of Hoechst 33342. Gentle trituration
with a wide-bore plastic Pasteur pipet was used to form the cell suspension,
which was deposited onto indium tin oxide (ITO) slides. To remove
excess extracellular glycerol, the samples were rinsed with 150 mM
ammonium acetate buffer (pH 10), which minimizes damage to the cells,20 and which was pH balanced to reduce removal
of endogenous peptides. A total of four sample slides containing cells
from four animals were used for analysis.

Islets of Langerhans
isolation was performed according to a previously
described protocol with minor modifications.21 Briefly, the pancreas was injected with 2 mL of 1.4 mg/mL collagenase
P solution from Clostridium histolyticum (Clostridiopeptidase A, EC 3.4. 24. 3; cat. no. 11 213 857 001,
Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) dissolved in mGBSS. The injected
pancreas was surgically dissected and placed in a 10 mL glass vial
containing 3 mL of the collagenase P solution and then incubated in
a recirculating water bath for 20–30 min at 37 °C. The
resulting suspension was washed twice with mGBSS for 3 min at 300g, resuspended in 10 mL of mGBSS, and sieved through a 1
× 1 mm mesh into a Petri dish. Manual collection of islets of
Langerhans into 2 mL of mGBSS in a 35 mm Petri dish was performed
with a micropipette under an inverted light microscope. To stain the
nuclei, 2 μL of 1 mg/mL Hoechst 33342 was added to the dish,
followed by incubation for 15 min at 15 °C. Islets were then
treated with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C for 20 min. Islets were
triturated into single cells and transferred to an ITO-slide, stabilized
in a 40% glycerol, 60% mGBSS solution, and followed by washing with
150 mM ammonium acetate.

Optical Imaging
Each dispersed cell
population was
imaged using an AxioVert 200 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss,
Oberkochen, Germany) with an X-CITE 120 mercury lamp (Lumen Dynamics,
Mississauga, Canada) and a 31000v2 DAPI filter set (Chroma Technology,
Irvine, CA). A 10× objective was used to obtain a mosaic image
with 10% overlap between neighboring images. Images were taken using
an AxioCam HRC color camera (Carl Zeiss) set to a resolution of 4164
× 3120.

Cell Localization
All mosaic optical
images were stitched
in ImageJ to output a list of relative offsets between images.22 Individual images were batch processed with
the “color threshold” and “analyze particles”
features in ImageJ to find the cell coordinates in each image. Cell
coordinates from each image were added to the corresponding image
offset to obtain the cell coordinates on the sample slide.

Geometry
File Creation
Before fluorescence imaging,
a silver sharpie was used to draw an ∼5 mm thick line along
two opposite sides of the cell population. An ultrafleXtreme mass
spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) was used to generate
multiple fiducial markers into each line by laser ablation.

After microscopy imaging and cell localization, 3000 rat pituitary
cells or ∼600 islets of Langerhans cells were randomly chosen
from their respective cellular populations. The determined cell coordinates
were used to create a custom geometry file for automatic single cell
MALDI-TOF MS analysis. The geometry file was created using the Java
JDK 1.6 Applet available at http://neuroproteomics.scs.illinois.edu/imaging.html, as described previously.15 All fiducial
markers were used when calculating the scaling and rotation parameters,
but only four markers were input into the applet.

Matrix Application
A solution of the MALDI matrix 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic
acid (50 mg/mL) in 1:1 acetone:water plus 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid
(TFA) was sprayed onto the samples using an artist’s airbrush
(Paasche Airbrush Company, Chicago, IL) propelled with nitrogen at
40 psi. The airbrush was held ∼60 cm from the sample, and the
matrix coating was built up by alternatively spraying 1 and 2 mL of
the matrix solution. The slide was rotated after each spray cycle
and dried completely. Coating thickness was estimated by weighing
the sample slide before and after matrix application and measuring
the coated area. A MALDI matrix coating of 0.2–0.4 mg/cm2 was applied.

MALDI-TOF MS
MALDI-TOF MS analysis
was conducted using
the Bruker ultrafleXtreme mass spectrometer with a frequency tripled
Nd:YAG solid state laser. The laser was set to the “small”
footprint setting at an ∼30 μm diameter. Acquisition
was automated to each cell location using the autoXecute feature of
the instrument and the custom geometry file generated earlier. For
pituitary cells, signals from 250 laser shots fired at 1000 Hz were
summed for each cell. Islets of Langerhans cells were analyzed with
1000 laser shots fired at 1000 Hz. Signals were summed from one spot
on the cell for both types of cells. Details for analyzing Aplysia neurons are included in the Supporting Information. To confirm and identify the markers
for pituitary subpopulations, tandem MS (MS/MS) was conducted on the
pituitary extracts using the LIFT mode of the mass spectrometer with
argon as the collision gas and an isolation window of 10 Da for the
precursor ions.

Identifying the Peptides in Pituitary Extracts
For
the pituitary samples, we also identified the peptides present using
larger samples, extracting the peptides and characterizing them via
liquid chromatography (LC)–MS. Details of the peptide extraction,
capLC–MALDI MS, and capLC–electrospray ionization (ESI)
MS/MS are provided in the Supporting Information.

Statistical Analysis
For all cell types, the raw mass
spectra were first processed using two R packages, MALDIquant and
MALDIquantForeign,23 in order to identify
those without a signal. Mass spectra were baseline subtracted using
the Top Hat algorithm with a half-window size of 50, smoothed using
the Savitzky-Golay algorithm with a half window size of 4, and peak
picked with a minimum signal-to-noise ratio of 3. After peak picking,
the intensity of the strongest peak was used to sort the mass spectral
data set in increasing intensity. Spectra sorted in this manner were
manually examined to exclude those without signal.

The remaining
mass spectra were processed and visualized using a custom Python script
(see the Supporting Information). The spectra
were down-binned to unit m/z resolution,
baseline subtracted with a window of 10, and normalized to the total
ion count before further analysis. PCA was used to categorize major
cell subpopulations by projecting the data onto the heavily weighted
principal vectors. Principal component (PC)-based outlier detection
was performed to find rare cells.24 The
same program also generated false-color peptide distribution maps
of the population. Signal intensity is illustrated using a rainbow
color scheme. To further enhance contrast, colors associated with
lower intensities (blue and green) were also made more transparent
using the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP; see http://www.gimp.org).

Results and Discussion
The goal of our approach is
to classify populations of neurons
and endocrine cells based on their peptide profiles in order to determine
categories of cells (cell types) in a complex sample, as well as to
identify unusual peptide profiles among the studied cells. MALDI appears
well-suited for this application because of its ability to profile
the hormone and neuropeptide content of individual cells.7,25−28 The cell population is dispersed over a microscope slide so that
the distance between the cells is large enough to enable MALDI MS
to assess individually isolated cells; next, each cell location is
profiled via MALDI-TOF MS. To validate the protocol and our ability
to target and assay individual cells, a preliminary experiment was
conducted on a population of A. californica neurons as they are larger and easier to visualize. Our results
confirm that the method enables targeting of cells randomly localized
on a slide (see the Supporting Information). Rather than further characterize our protocol using the 30–50
μm diameter Aplysia neurons,
we then moved to smaller mammalian neuroendocrine cells.

High-Throughput
MALDI-TOF MS Analysis of Pituitary Cells
We demonstrate the
capability of the approach by analyzing populations
of rat pituitary cells. The pituitary was chosen because it contains
different morphological and functional regions, with many cell types
expressing high levels of well-characterized cell-to-cell signaling
peptides.7,29−31 Challenges faced when
working with these samples include their relatively small cell size
(10–20 μm diameter) and cell optical transparency (Figure
S3 of the Supporting Information). Therefore,
live pituitary cells were labeled with the nuclear stain Hoechst 33342
and stabilized with glycerol before being dispersed onto the slides.
We have previously used a similar glycerol stabilization protocol
to conduct quantitative single cell MALDI MS peptide measurements26 and in another study showed that glycerol stabilization
helps to maintain cell integrity during sample preparation and decreases
CE−MS measurement variability.5 We
have also obtained pituitary peptide profiles using this protocol
that are similar to those reported by others using different approaches.30 Nuclear staining enables cell coordinates to
be determined from fluorescent images based on nucleus size and brightness.
The stain did not produce interfering MS signals in the peptide mass
range (Figure S4 of the Supporting Information).

To speed up the MALDI MS analysis while still demonstrating
high-throughput capabilities, 3000 cells were randomly chosen from
each population and deposited on the four microscope slides. These
cells were typically distributed over a roughly 2.5 × 4 cm2 area. If we used traditional MSI to analyze these cell populations,
∼10000000 pixels would have been needed to image the area at
a 10 μm lateral resolution. This high a resolution would be
necessary for spatially resolving single cells when using a raster
pattern in imaging mode. Assuming the same MALDI MS conditions as
used in this study, each pixel would need at least 0.25 s to be acquired
(summing signals from 250 laser shots fired at 1000 Hz). These conditions
would lead to an overall data collection time of several hundred hours.
With the targeted profiling technique presented here, the MS analysis
can be done in about an hour.

Each cell was profiled with a
single MALDI MS acquisition. The
laser spot was set at a diameter of ∼30 μm, which is
larger than typical pituitary cells, ensuring that the entire cell
was sampled. This reduces signal variations that may result from only
partially sampling a cell. Even from a single cell, several pituitary
peptides were detected, including arginine vasopressin (AVP), oxytocin,
and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) (Figure 1), which are markers of the posterior and intermediate
pituitary. The identity of these peptides was confirmed via MALDI
MS/MS (Figure S5 of the Supporting Information). Melanotrophs in the intermediate pituitary express high amounts
of peptides derived from the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) prohormone,
such as α-MSH, joining peptide and β-endorphin.32 As is typical for melanotrophs, mass spectra
with intense α-MSH signals also contain other POMC peptides
(Figure 2). The detection of AVP and oxytocin
in cells selected by nuclear stain and cell morphology is surprising.
According to the classical view, AVP and oxytocin are expressed in
the soma of distantly located hypothalamic neurons and then transported
to their release sites in the posterior pituitary.33 Thus, no AVP and oxytocin cell bodies were expected. The
posterior pituitary is primarily composed of these hypothalamic-originating
terminals and neurites rather than cells, so it is intriguing to find
pituitary cells with AVP and oxytocin signals. It is possible that
hypothalamic neuron terminals were colocalized with some pituitary
cells, which is consistent with the weak-to-moderate coappearance
of POMC peptides with AVP in many spectra (Figure S6 of the Supporting Information). However, several reports
have demonstrated AVP-related immunostaining34 and vasopressin RNA35 in some pituicytes,36 and AVP may be internalized into some cells,37,38 and so either is a possibility. The current data do not resolve
the source of these peptides.

population of pituitary cells. Distribution of (A) AVP-containing
cells and (B) ac-α-MSH-containing melanotrophs. Signal intensity
is color coded and increases from blue to red, with blue indicating
noise level. The intensity of the color scale is distinct for each
ion.

Figure 2 Mass spectrum acquired from a melanotroph. Several
peptides from
the POMC prohormone are detected, including α-MSH, joining peptide
(J-peptide), corticotropin-like intermediate peptide (CLIP), and β-endorphin.

Determination of Major
Pituitary Cell Subpopulations using PCA
We also worked on
effective data mining. Compared to traditional
MSI, the data set collected with this approach is simplified and minimized
because it contains only spectra from cells rather than a mix of spectra
from cells, debris, media, and empty spaces. PCA was conducted to
classify cell types (Figure 3). Although more
manual statistical methods (e.g., examining biaxial plots) can also
be used, multivariate methods take into account the entire data set.
Our nonsupervised analysis facilitates the detection of features because
it reveals those that are responsible for major patterns in the data.
For the described data set, the chemical profiles obtained via MALDI
MS revealed multiple pituitary cellular populations. The loading spectra
have a strong contribution from ac-α-MSH in PC 1, lipidlike
signals for PC 2, and AVP for PC 3 (Figure 3B). This pattern is consistent with examining peptide distribution
maps, with PC 1 highlighting melanotrophs and PC 3 showing cells with
strong AVP signal. PC 2 may be composed of cells from the anterior
pituitary, where lipids may be the dominant chemical species observed
in the targeted mass range. Another possibility may be partially lysed
cells that still retain the stained nucleus. Although the pituitary
contains distinct cell types with well-characterized content, the
PCA shows a high degree of heterogeneity, with data points spreading
out along the PCs to show a continuum of signal instead of an on–off
behavior (Figure 3A). We have taken care to
reduce measurement variations by validating our ability to target
cells using an Aplysia neuronal population.
Our previous work with the stretched sample method also corroborates
our targeting accuracy.15−18 Together, these factors support the notion that the
observed variations may be biological in origin rather than a measurement
artifact.

Determination of Chemically
Distinct Rare Cells in the Pituitary
Examining the first
few PCs is useful for finding major patterns;
however, minor variations, such as chemically rare cells, may be overlooked
because they are not captured in the first few PCs. Mass spectra corresponding
to rare cells may not strongly influence the largest principal vectors
but may be identified by projecting the data onto the smallest principal
vectors. In practice, with high-dimensional data sets, it is often
more computationally efficient to project onto the largest principal
vectors then back-project into the original data space and, finally,
subtract the resulting spectra from the original. The difference reveals
the parts of the data that were not captured by typical PCA.24 The number of PCs used for back-projection determines
the sensitivity for detecting rare signals, with more PCs leading
to the observation of more unique signals.

This PCA-outlier
detection approach was applied using the first 23 PCs (∼90%
of the total variance) for back-projection. Figure 4 shows the generated difference mass spectrum. Although some
major pituitary peptides are still present, many uncommon signals
are also visible. Several signals are tentatively labeled as contaminants
(and not from cells) by examining the relevant mass spectra and the
ion distribution pattern on the slide. Table 1 summarizes the peptide-containing cell types found using traditional
and extended PCA. Other than melanotrophs, each cell type is labeled
with their distinguishing peptide marker. The characteristic ions
for each population are listed in Table S1 of the Supporting Information. Cells identified as melanotrophs,
or those containing AVP and oxytocin signals, are classified as major
cell populations. AVP and oxytocin-exhibiting cells are separated
into two groups because some differences were seen in their spatial
distribution. A characteristic ion at m/z 2264.2 was detected in a large portion of melanotrophs and used
to classify a subpopulation of melanotrophs. For rare cells, it is
not surprising that most of the apparent biomarkers detected were
not identified. One exception is the signal at m/z 1622.8, which matches by mass to unmodified α-MSH.
Most α-MSH in the intermediate pituitary is acetylated, but
the nonacetylated form is also present39 and has been observed in prior MSI studies of the pituitary.31 Revealing these rare cells in conjunction with
larger subpopulations demonstrates the usefulness of our PCA-based
statistical workflow to highlight major and minor patterns.

ions are labeled with their m/z ratios.

a Each presented biomarker classifies
a cell population, subpopulation, or a rare cell type. Only cells
with peptide signals are classified.

Another interesting signal at m/z 2105.3 was detected in many cells and does not appear
to have originated
from the intermediate or posterior pituitary. Using LC–MALDI
MS/MS, we identified this ion as a putative somatotropin-related peptide.
However, only a portion of the sequence is supported by genomic data
(Figure S7 of the Supporting Information). This assignment suggests the detection of somatotrophs from the
anterior pituitary. LC–ESI MS/MS measurements on the same sample
uncovered a number of other pituitary peptides, including known somatotropin-related
peptides (Table S2 of the Supporting Information). Peptidomic analysis revealed peptides from the prolactin prohormone,
suggesting the presence of lactotrophs in the sample. Both somatotrophs
and lactotrophs are acidophiles, while other major cell types in the
anterior pituitary more readily take up basophilic stains.40 Peptides from prohormones known to be expressed
in basophiles (corticotropin, thyrotropin, lutropin, and follicle-stimulating
hormone) were not detected in our peptidomic experiments. It is possible
that the predominant detection of peptides from acidophilic cell types
may have been caused by the acidic extraction and separation conditions.

Determination of Islets of Langerhans Cell Populations
In
order to explore whether the approach will work with smaller endocrine
cells, we studied the rat pancreatic islet of Langerhans. As the islet
cells are smaller than cells from pituitary, being between 3–6
μm in diameter, these represent a more difficult challenge for
accurate cell targeting. In these cases, we dispersed cells from individual
islets for each experiment.

PCA was performed on a MALDI MS
data set with spectra from ∼600 single cells. PC 1, 2, and
3 distinguished cell types based on known pancreatic prohormones (Figure 5, Table 2).41,42 In the loading spectrum for PC 1, peptides characteristic for beta
cells (insulin 1 and 2 prohormones) separated cells containing peptides
characteristic for alpha cells (the glucagon prohormone), with the
peptides having opposite loading signs. Beta cells also have higher
scores on PC 3 than alpha cells. In PC 2, the somatostatin-14 peptide,
characteristic of delta cells, appeared with an opposite sign to the
loading for insulin peptide from beta cells, hence separating these
cell types as well. Although these three cell types are separated
via PCA, gamma cells, which are characterized by the pancreatic hormone,
appear convoluted in the same direction as alpha cells in the score
plot. The loading for pancreatic hormone in PC 1 has the same sign
as the glucagon prohormone peptide, and the loading in PC 2 is close
to zero. Gamma cells are much less abundant than other cell types
in islets of Langerhans throughout a majority of the rat pancreas.41 We expect that the low count of these observations
did not provide enough data variability to separate this cell type
from others, and explains why alpha and gamma cells are grouped together
in the score plot. Our results show successful categorization of most
cell types from the rat pancreatic islets of Langerhans, further demonstrating
the method’s capability to conduct population-level single
cell analysis, and to classify cells based on peptide biomarkers.

Conclusions
We have developed a
novel approach that combines in vitro live
cell labeling, optical microscopy, image processing, high throughput
single cell mass spectrometry, and multivariate statistical analysis,
to enable cellular classification via multiplexed analysis of cell
peptide content. Cells in a randomly distributed population were individually
examined by finding the cell coordinates using optical microscopy
and performing automated single cell MALDI-TOF MS analysis. The entire
cell is profiled via MALDI MS, and the MS data obtained from hundreds
to thousands of single cells allows cellular subpopulations and rare
cells to be revealed. We demonstrate this method on multiple cell
populations from the rat pituitary and pancreatic islets of Langerhans,
and the A. californica nervous system.

The multiplexed chemical data that is generated, which includes
spatial information, has parallels to data obtained using MSI. However,
the approach described here saves time and improves specificity by
examining only the cells of interest. One could use more specific
stains than the nuclear stains used here. For example, stains that
differentiate glia and neurons can be used that enable populations
of cells to be classified based on the localization stain, and then
their chemical differences compared. In addition, although we have
categorized cells here based only on their peptide profiles, morphological
information generated during optical cell finding may contribute another
dimension for cell classification. Beyond the endocrine cell populations
covered here, this approach may be used to conduct chemical classification
of many cell types across multiple species and can easily be extended
to lipids and other molecular classes that are detected via MALDI
MS.
