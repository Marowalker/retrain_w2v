DNA nanomachines are becoming useful
tools for molecular recognition,
imaging, and diagnostics and have drawn gradual attention. Unfortunately,
the present application of most DNA nanomachines is limited in vitro,
so expanding their application in organism has become a primary focus.
Hence, a novel DNA nanomachine named t-switch, based on the DNA duplex–triplex
transition, is developed for monitoring the intracellular pH gradient.
Our strategy is based on the DNA triplex structure containing C+-G-C triplets and pH-dependent Förster resonance energy
transfer (FRET). Our results indicate that the t-switch is an efficient
reporter of pH from pH 5.3 to 6.0 with a fast response of a few seconds.
Also the uptake of the t-switch is speedy. In order to protect the
t-switch from enzymatic degradation, PEI is used for modification
of our DNA nanomachine. At the same time, the dynamic range could
be extended to pH 4.6–7.8. The successful application of this
pH-depended DNA nanomachine and motoring spatiotemporal pH changes
associated with endocytosis is strong evidence of the possibility
of self-assembly DNA nanomachine for imaging, targeted therapies,
and controllable drug delivery.

DNA is an
attractive and useful
material for constructing functional architectures.1−9 A large number of nanomachines based on the DNA scaffold, such as
the DNA tweezer, walker, and motors10−13 have been reported. Design of
novel DNA nanomachines has attracted particularly attention because
of their many potential applications in nanoelectronic devices, biosensors,
molecular computation, and smart materials.14−17 On the basis of different response
mechanisms including conformation changes, strand displacement, and
enzymatic activity, a variety of DNA structures, such as i-motif,
G-quadruplex, and triplex, have been used as building blocks for constructing
nanomachines.18−20 Each of these DNA nanomachines can respond to specific
triggers and convert to an output due to the conformation changes.
Owing to the specificity and biocompatibility of DNA nanomachine,
it is highly interesting to fabricate DNA nanomachines into powerful
biosensors that can monitor chemical stimuli in vitro and in vivo.
However, applications of DNA nanomachines in vivo are difficult to
exploit owing to the difficulty in cellular internalization of negatively
charged DNA.21−25

pH plays a critical role in living cells, and its biological
significance
has attracted much attention. Intracellular pH (pHi) changes,
especially in organelles, are connected with many physiological processes
such as internalization pathways26,27 and muscle
contraction.28,29 On the other hand, abnormal pHi values are associated with inappropriate cell function, growth,
cell proliferation, and apoptosis.30−36 Besides, some common diseases, such as cancer37 and Alzheimer’s disease,38 are characterized by pHi changes in biological events.
As a consequence, monitoring the pHi gradient is highly
important but remains a great challenge. Hence, many pH-sensitive
DNA nanomachines and non-DNA-based pH sensors, including organic fluorescent
probes, nanosensors, and fluorescent proteins, have been reported
to be used in vivo. However, these non-DNA-based pH sensors have their
certain defects. For instance, some organic fluorescent probes39−43 suffer from complicated synthesis, bad biocompatibility, poor light
stability, and high cytotoxicity. Nanosensors, constructed from quantum
dots,44,45 polymers,46−52 metal nanoparticles,53−55 and carbon nanomaterials,56−58 are limited
by the low loading rate of the dye, poor repeatability, and controversial
cytotoxicity. Likewise, fluorescent proteins59,60 could only be expressed though complicated encoding, synthesis,
and strict experiment operating. Therefore, these drawbacks may limit
their application in cellular measurements. Compared with non-DNA-based
pHi sensors, pH-sensitive DNA nanomachines show certain
advantages.61−65 DNA is a kind of environmental friendly new material with stable
physical and chemical properties. The synthetic of DNA sequence is
simple, and it is convenient to modify. At the same time, based on
accurate principle of complementary base pairing, design of DNA nanomachines
is predictable and programmable. In a word, the DNA nanomachine is
an ideal tool to detect pHi. However, although several
pH-dependent DNA nanomachines66−69 have been reported, most of them can only be used
in vitro. At present, the i-switch has been used in vivo, which is
the first example of an autonomous DNA nanomachine that can respond
to a specific molecular trigger in the living cell.70,71 Unfortunately, i-switch could only map pH changes on long time scales
of a few minutes in vivo, which is unsuitable for monitoring instantaneous
biological processes. Therefore, the design of DNA nanomachines which
can be used in vivo for catching pH changes on short time scales is
a challenge but desirable task.

Here a novel DNA nanomachine
based on DNA duplex–triplex
transition (t-switch) is developed to monitor the pHi gradient.
Our approach is based on the principle of a DNA triplex nanomachine
containing C+-G-C triplets. A pH-dependent FRET is recorded
during the duplex–triplex transition process,72,73 demonstrating that t-switch is an efficient pH sensor from pH 5.3
to 6.0 and could be uptaken by cells easily. Furthermore, to facilitate
the endocytosis process74,75 and protect the t-switch
from enzymatic degradation, PEI, a common cationic polymer for gene
transfer, is used for packing the t-switch. Surprisingly, the dynamic
responding range of the t-switch can be extended to 4.6–7.8
by complexing with PEI. Moreover, the t-switch could function autonomously
inside living HepG2 cells to map and monitor intracellular pH changes
after endocytosis.

As the working principle shown in Scheme 1, the t-switch consists of three oligonucleotide
strands A, B, and
C, where B and C can hybridize with A, leaving a one-base gap. Both
strands A and B have overhangs at the 5′ termini which are
labeled with pH-insensitive dye Alexa-488 and Alexa-647, respectively.
The cytosine (C) riched overhang of strand A is single-stranded, while
the overhang of strand B is double-stranded which contains CG bases.
At high pH as the “open state” of the t-switch, these
two overhangs form an extended duplex conformation to separate the
two fluorophores and avoid FRET happening. However, in acidic conditions,
the single-stranded overhang of strand A will bind in a parallel orientation
to the double-stranded overhang of strand B. Therefore, the C+-G-C triad structure will be formed to induce the triplex
structure of the t-switch, yielding a “closed state”
to bring two fluorophores into proximity. As a result, FRET could
take place between the Alexa-488/647 FRET pair. Thus, the formation
of the triplex and the exhibition of FRET signal could be sensitive
to pH. Inspired by published work,66 we
design the sequences of the t-switch, which are shown in Table S1
in the Supporting Information.

Scheme 1 Construction
and Principle of t-Switch in the “Open”
State (Low FRET) at High pH and in the “Closed” State
(High FRET) at Low pH
The fluorescence properties of the t-switch are first
investigated
as a function of pH to determine its pH responsive range (Figure 1a). With the decrease of the pH value, a gradual
decrease of fluorescent intensity at 520 nm for donor fluorophore
has been observed, while a new florescence peak appears at 665 nm
for the acceptor fluorophore. Therefore, donor fluorescence decreases
while acceptor fluorescence increases as a result of FRET, indicating
the transition from the open to closed state of the t-switch upon
the pH change. The plot of fluorescence ratios (D/A) of Alexa-488/647-labeled
t-switch as a function of pH (Figure 1b) shows
a sigmoid increase between pH 5.3 and 6.0 with a 4-fold ratio increase
and the pKa value is determined to be
5.67 (the calculation is shown in the Supporting
Information, Figure S2a). This makes it a good nanomachine
to track fine pH changes associated with endosomal maturation.

nm while the solution pH value oscillated between 5.0 and 8.0. (d)
Response time for the transition between the open and closed states.
Addition of base and acid was shown by arrows.

The in vivo performance of the t-switch is then evaluated
by incubating
the t-switch with cells. The 80 nM t-switch is added to cultured HepG2
cells. After incubating for 10 min at 37 °C, cells are washed
3 times with PBS buffer. The confocal images are shown in Figure 2a. The uptake of the t-switch by living cells is
speedy, and some t-switches are distributed in lysosomes (Figure S4
in the Supporting Information). In the
green channel, the fluorescence intensity of Alex488 is variable within
single cells consistent with uneven intracellular pH distributions
while the fluorescence signal is very weak in the red channel (Alex
647). It may be that DNA nanomachines are partly internalized through
anion channels and entered into early endosomes which will become
lysosomes after a series of physiological changes.70 During this process, pH value will deceases from 7.4 inside
early endosomes to 5.0 in the lysosomes (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information),76−79 and t-switches will be in two
stages with different pH values. In early endosomes, the pH is 7.4–6.0
while C+-G-C triad structure only formed when the pH was
below 6.0. So t-switches are in the “open” state and
FRET could not happen. On the other hand, when early endosomes become
late endosomes and lysosomes, where the pH is below 6.0, t-switches
are in the “close” state and signal in the red channel
is observed in Figure 2a. Moreover, it becomes
brighter as time goes on (enlarged images of the red channel are shown
in Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). This means an increasing number of t-switches turn to the “close”
state as endosomes become lysosomes. Besides the reason above, we
think that the elaborate enzyme system in lysosomes may affect the
stability of the t-switch. This could also lead to weak signal in
the red channel. Then, lactate buffer (pH 6.0) and 5-(N,N-dimethyl)amiloride (DMA), an inhibitor of Na+/H+ exchanger, are added to induce the decrease
of intracellular pH.80−82 Upon the treatment, the reduction of pH value induces
the formation of a “close” state, resulting in bright
fluorescence signals in the red channel (Figure 2b). At the same time, there are obvious changes of fluorescence intensity
in both the green channel and red channel (Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). Partial enlarged ratiometric
images of acidation HepG2 cells are shown in Figure S8 in the Supporting Information. This pH change caused
by acidizing is confirmed by using BCECF-AM as a pH indicator and
the result are shown in Figure S9 in the Supporting
Information. More confocal images of RAW264.7 cells are mentioned
in the Supporting Information (Figure S10).
Although the cellular colocalization of the t-switch and Lyso-Tracker
Red shows that the uptake of the t-switch is speedy, we suspect that
it is hard for the t-switch to remain stably inside cells according
to the weaker signal in the red channel in Figure 2a. So how to improve it is stability is the crux of the matter.

cells after acidizing.

Lysosomes are important acid organelles in cells. Abnormal
functions
of lysosomes are associated with many diseases such as silicosis,
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and all kinds of lysosomal storage disorder.
Meanwhile, the relationship of lysosomes and tumor increasingly aroused
people’s concern. Therefore, monitoring pH changes between
different functional phases of lysosomes is of great significance.
However, there are large amounts of DNase in lysosomes and pose a
threat to the stability of the t-switch. We think this may be the
reason why our t-switch could not remain stably in cells. Therefore,
we explore the idea of polyplex to facilitate cell internalization
of our pH-sensitive DNA nanodevice. PEI facilitates the internalization
of DNA by complexing with DNA through electrostatic interactions and
also protects DNA from enzymatic degradation.83,84 After mixing with PEI at an N/P ratio of 1:3, DNA is efficiently
condensed into particle-like complexes with sizes ranging from 20
to 50 nm (Figure S3b in the Supporting Information). The PEI/DNA complex did not affect the function of the t-switch,
as shown in Figure 3a. Surprisingly, the response
pH of the t-switch is extended to pH 4.6–7.8 with the pKa value of 6.53 (Figure S2b in the Supporting Information), most likely due to the
pH sponge effect of PEI. The wide range is composed with two ranges:
pH 4.6–5.8 and pH 5.8–7.8. Meanwhile, forming a complex
with PEI did not influence the fast response of the t-switch to pH
(Figure 4b).

complexes. (a) pH-dependent
emission spectra changes of the PEI/DNA complex (20 nM) in PBS at
25 °C. (b) The donor/acceptor (D/A) intensity (Alexa-488/Alexa-647)
ratios changes in vitro.

Figure 4 (a) Working cycling of PEI/DNA complexes. Fluorescence intensity
was monitored at 520 nm by excitation at 488 nm while the solution
pH value oscillated between 5.0 and 8.0. (b) Response time for the
formation of the open and closed states. Addition of base and acid
was shown by arrows.

The stability of the t-switch in living cells is very important
for application in vivo. Therefore, in order to prove our conjecture,
we imitate ambiance of the lysosomes and investigate the stability
of the t-switch in different conditions. As shown in Figure 5, its stability in the presence of DNase II is greatly
enhanced after forming a complex with PEI. A sharp decrease of fluorescence
intensity appears when DNase II is added to the naked t-switch. In
contrast, only a slight decrease of fluorescence is observed within
330 min for the PEI/DNA complex. Taken together, the above observations
show that PEI not only extends the pH working range for the t-switch
but also offers protection capability against cellular enzymes. These
experimental results also prove our hypothesis on the second reason
why the fluorescence signal is weak in the red channel of Figure 2a. In lysosomes, construction of some t-switches
will be destroyed because of the high concentration and activity of
DNase II.

Figure 5 Experiments aimed at understanding the stability of the t-switch.

II in the t-switch or PEI/DNA complexes, respectively.

Furthermore, HepG2 cells are incubated with the
PEI/DNA complex
(20 nM) for 20 min at 37 °C and then washed three times with
PBS buffer. The PEI/DNA complex can enter cells by the endocytosis
pathway. As PEI//DNA complexes in endosomes where the pH value is
just in it’s dynamic range, there are some hotspots in the
red channel (Figure 6) while the bare t-switch
shows a weaker fluorescence signal in the same field (Figure 2a). The fluorescence changes along with time could
be observed via monitoring hotspots in the red channel (Figure S12
in the Supporting Information). Partial
enlarged ratiometric images of single HepG2 cell are shown in Figure
S11 in the Supporting Information.

Figure 6 Confocal fluorescence
images of the PEI/DNA complex in HepG2 cells.

Confocal experiments show that the t-switch could enter living
HepG2 cells within 10 min while it is well-known that the uptake of
naked DNA is difficult. In order to explain the fast uptake, we study
the cellular internalization ability of the t-switch. Our t-switch
and dye-labeled single-stranded DNA (strand A and strand B) are incubated
with different cells, respectively. The confocal fluorescence images
show that the t-switch could be assimilated easily by the testing
cells, while it is difficult for strands A and B to internalize. We
conjecture that the presence of nanostructure is crucial for efficient
cellular internalization (Figure S13 in the Supporting
Information). Besides, the internalization mechanism of the
t-switch and PEI/DNA complex is further investigated by incubating
them with HepG2 cells after inhibition of endocytosis by potassium
depletion,85 respectively. The flow cytometric
analysis results shown in Figures S14 and S15 in the Supporting Information indicate that after blocking the endocytosis
pathway, delivery of PEI/DNA complexes is effectively inhibited, while
the uptake of the naked t-switch is not affected. The data of the
mean fluorescence intensity and the number of selected cells in different
conditions are shown in Table S2 in the Supporting
Information. Our researchers indicate that the t-switch may
enter living cells through other internalization pathways. More details
about their routes of entry still need be investigated.

In conclusion,
we have demonstrated a FRET-based DNA nanomachine
for fast-responding mapping pH changes in living cells. The as-designed
t-switch is sensitive to pH between pH 5.3 to 6.0. Remarkably, it
is on the time scales of a few seconds while other DNA nanomachines
are on long time scales of a few minutes. The fast response speed
makes it easy to catch pH changes associated with instantaneous biological
processes on shorter time scales. Evidently, the t-switch shows excellent
reversibility for several pH cycles, after repetitive addition of
NaOH and HCl diluted the sample. More importantly, the t-switch can
gain entrance to living cells without any transfection reagent in
a few minutes. For stability and inducing endocytosis, PEI is used
to form the PEI-DNA nanomachine complex. In addition to a wide dynamic
range of pH 4.6–7.8, complexing with PEI could protect the
t-switch from enzyme decomposition in endosomes and lysosomes. Therefore,
the t-switch is expected to be used as a reporter of intracellular
pH changes associated with biological processes due to its fast response,
relative stability to enzyme, and wide dynamic range. The successful
application of this pH-dependent DNA nanomachine and monitoring spatiotemporal
pH changes associated with endocytosis could be useful for the future
application of the self-assembled DNA nanomachine in the field of
imaging, targeted therapies, and controllable drug delivery.
