Surface
enhanced Raman correlation spectroscopy (SERCS) is shown
as a label-free, chemically specific method for monitoring individual
polymer beads and lipid vesicles interacting with a 2-D planar surface
enhanced Raman (SERS) substrate in solution. The enhancement afforded
by the SERS substrate allows for spectral data to be acquired in series
at rates between 31 and 83 Hz. Auto- and cross-correlation of spectral
data facilitates the measurement of diffusion constants for particles
ranging in radius from 50 to 500 nm while discriminating signal associated
with the target analyte from extraneous fluctuations. The measured
diffusion coefficients are on the order of 10–10–10–11 cm2/s, a factor of 40
times slower than predicted from the Stokes–Einstein equation,
suggesting that particles are experiencing hindered diffusion at the
surface. The enhanced signals appear to originate from particles less
than 5 nm of the SERS substrate, consistent with adsorption to the
surface. This work provides a means to measure and monitor surface
interactions and demonstrates the utility and limits of SERS detection
in solution over planar SERS substrates.

Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy
(SERS) has been repeatedly demonstrated as a powerful tool for ultrasensitive
chemical detection.1−3 Since the initial observation of Raman enhancement
on a roughened Ag electrode4,5 an understanding of
the underlying mechanisms that give rise to the observed enhancement
has been established. A localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)
generates an increased electric field and also reradiates Raman scattering.6 The combination of these effects can generate
enhancements up to 1011 when optimized,7 sufficient for the detection of single molecules.8−11 The formation of chemisorbed adlayers often shows additional enhancement,
the so-called chemical enhancement effect, associated with the formation
of a surface complex.12 It is now understood
that the largest enhancements arise from metallic junctions consisting
of two or more nanostructures in close proximity (1–2 nm),
with the greatest field—a SERS “hot spot”—localized
at the space between them.7,13

Hot spots have
been shown to dominate observed SERS signals;14,15 however, recent studies have suggested that SERS enhancements originating
from molecules outside of the junction gap also generate appreciable
SERS signals.16,17 Studies comparing the spatial
location of the Rayleigh scattering maximum, or hot spot, with the
location of the SERS intensity maximum suggest that enhancement outside
of the gap region is sufficient for detection at the single-molecule
limit.16 Further, the finding that the
SERS enhancement factor is insensitive to the number of particles
in an assembly of nanostructures15 suggests
that perhaps the model in which hot spots dominate the observed SERS
spectrum is insufficient to explain the whole picture. In aggregated
nanostructured systems with high densities of hotspots, such as our
SERS substrate18 and the randomly arranged
surfaces fabricated by Nishijima et al.,19 the resulting fringing field provides a mechanism for enhancement
and detection of molecules outside gap junctions. In our recent communication,
we showed that individual polystyrene beads and lipid vesicles could
be detected diffusing across a SERS substrate in solution.17 Clearly, these assemblies are too large to fit
inside a 1–2 nm gap between nanostructures.

The field
enhancements obtained upon excitation of an LSPR have
been shown to decay rapidly from the nanostructure surface.20,21 Empirical investigations based on molecules confined to the surface
show an r–10 dependence associated
with the nanostructure radius,20 as well
as an exponential decrease associated with the curvature of the surface.21 In either analysis, the SERS enhancement is
reported to be a short-range effect.

In this report, we demonstrate
the utility of the large enhancements
observed on a planar SERS substrate to facilitate rapid spectral acquisition
of particles diffusing in solution. Correlation analysis uses signal
intensity fluctuations to gain information related to the size and
diffusion dynamics of a species, as well as species concentration.
Although dynamic light scattering (DLS)22 and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy23 are the most commonly utilized forms of correlation analysis, it
has also been demonstrated using Raman spectroscopy (RCS)24 and SERS25−27 from nanoparticles and aggregates.
With the enhancement afforded by our SERS substrate, we are able to
collect spectra at a rate sufficient to demonstrate meaningful correlations
and fits for lipid vesicles and polymer beads ranging from 100 to
1000 nm in diameter diffusing above an enhancing surface. We demonstrate
the utility and limits of surface enhanced Raman correlation spectroscopy
(SERCS) as a chemically specific method of monitoring surface interactions
in solution.

Experimental Section
SERS Measurements
All experiments were performed on
a lab-built Raman microscope based on an Olympus BX-51 microscope
body.17,18 Key components include a 17mW HeNe laser
(Melles Griot) at 623.8 nm, an OD6 Rugate notch filter (Edmond Optics),
and an i303 spectrograph equipped with a Newton 970 EMCCD camera (Andor).
The EMCCD camera was binned vertically and operated in electron multiplying
mode. Water dipping objectives (Olympus, 40×, 0.8NA and Leica
63×, 0.9NA) were used for excitation and collection of the Raman
signal. The collected Raman scattering is focused onto the entrance
slit by an f-matched lens (Olympus, 4X, 0.1NA) to
maximize the amount of collected scatter onto the EMCCD detector.

SERS substrates were fabricated as described previously.18 Briefly, silver was vapor-deposited onto a porous
anodized aluminum (AAO) substrate with 100 nm pores (Whatman, Anodisc
13). The film was epoxied to a glass slide, and the AAO template was
stripped by soaking the substrate for 24 h in 0.1 M NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich).
The resulting nanostructured silver film SERS substrate has been reported
to show an enhancement factor on the order of 108.

Spectral data were collected in series at readout rates from 31
to 83 Hz. The series varied in length from 250 to 1000 spectra. The
laser power was attenuated to 1 mW with a combination of a half wave
plate and polarizer. The temperature was not explicitly controlled,
but was monitored to be between 20 and 25 °C, with less than
1 °C variation during experiments. Data analysis was performed
in MATLAB (MathWorks). In total, 317 kinetic series were collected
and analyzed.

Sample Preparation
Solutions containing
1,2-dipalmityol-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC)
(Avanti Polar Lipids)
single-shell vesicles of varying sizes were prepared by extrusion
through polycarbonate filters (Whatman, Nuclepore) with decreasing
pore size (1000, 400, 200, and 100 nm).28 For SERS experiments, vesicle solutions were diluted to 0.05 wt
% with nanopure water (18.2 MΩ-cm, Thermo Scientific). Polystyrene
beads (Sigma-Aldrich) of varying sizes (1100, 300, and 100 nm) were
diluted to 0.001 wt % in nanopure water. A 200 μL drop of diluted
solution was placed directly onto the substrate, and meniscus contact
was made with the dipping objective.

Dynamic Light Scattering
Samples were independently
sized using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern) with DPPC and PS bead solutions
of 0.025 and 0.00025 wt %, respectively. Individual sizing runs consisted
of 11 measurements taken in a backscattering configuration. Three
sizing runs were averaged to determine the average particle size and
standard deviation for each solution.

Results
Polystyrene
Beads
Data from a representative kinetic
series collection of 0.001 wt % 440 nm PS beads are shown in Figure 1. The collection shown was acquired with 10 ms spectral
collection times (10 ms acquisition, 60 Hz) for 500 spectra. The acquisition
conditions do not generate measurable spontaneous Raman signal; therefore,
all signal measured must arise from SERS.

Figure 1 Example of data analysis
performed on 10 ms, 440 nm PS bead SERS
spectra collected in kinetic series. Panel A shows a 3D heat map of
the SERS intensity as a function of time and frequency; B, the spectrum
at t = 2.87s (blue) compared with the PS reference
spectrum (black); and C plots the intensity vs time profiles at relevant
PS frequencies: 627 (black), 1009 (red), 1035 (yellow), 1205 (green),
1498 (light blue), and 1610 cm–1 (blue). Panel D
shows autocorrelated profiles, which are fit to a model to determine
a correlation decay time. From the decay times, the diffusion coefficient
can be determined.

Figure 1A shows a three-dimensional heat
map of SERS signal intensity as a function of both time (x axis) and spectral frequency (y axis). The measured
SERS intensity, as a function of the two variables, is represented
as a color, with blue representing low intensity and red high intensity.
Individual spectra in the kinetic series show bands corresponding
to reference spectrum for the given material (Figure 1B). The spectra in Figure 1B are from
a polystyrene reference (black) and the spectrum in the heat map at t = 2.87s (blue). The peak intensities observed at 627,
1005, 1200, and 1610 cm–1 are indicative of a PS
bead near the enhancing surface. These peaks correspond to the ring-stretching
(627, 1200, 1610 cm–1) and ring-breathing (1005
cm–1) modes of PS.29 Also
present in the spectrum is a reproducible background signal attributable
to the substrate with a pronounced shoulder between 600 and 800 cm–1.

The time-dependent intensity fluctuations
associated with peaks
in the kinetic series were determined by integrating spectral intensity
over a width of ∼10 cm–1 (5 pixels) around
peaks in the reference spectrum, as shown in Figure 1C. The spectra are best characterized as a constant background
with intermittent signal bursts attributable to particles moving in
and out of the detection area.

Differences in adsorption geometry
can lead to the observation
of different bands from the same molecule. Further, random intensity
fluctuations from impurities or overall changes in background signal
can artifactually appear in the intensity profiles. However, Raman
spectra are inherently multiplexed in that a single spectrum typically
contains multiple peaks attributable to the functional groups present
in the sample. To determine if peak fluctuations arise from the same
particle, the intensity profiles were subjected to Pearson’s r cross-correlation analysis (eq 1).30 1  In eq 1, A and B represent the values
of two given intensity profiles, and A̅ and B̅ are the means of those two intensity profiles.
The cross-correlation coefficient was used to establish a threshold
(r > 0.5) to discriminate between Raman band profiles
demonstrating statistically significant correlation, or signal, versus
those demonstrating uncorrelated or negatively correlated noise.

Figure 1C shows intensity profiles at multiple
Raman frequencies present in the PS reference spectrum, including
627 (black), 1009 (red), 1035 (yellow), 1205 (green), 1498 (light
blue), and 1610 cm–1 (blue). In accordance with
what is observed in the spectra in panel B, each profile shows a spike
in intensity at t = 2.87s. Profiles showed a strong
positive correlation were included in the autocorrelation analysis
(Figure 1D).

Profiles with strong positive
cross-correlation scores were autocorrelated
to generate decay curves. A functional model for three-dimensional
diffusion in solution31 was fit to the
resulting autocorrelation curves to establish characteristic decay
times (τD.) 2  In eq 2, I(t) represents
the signal intensity at a give time, I(t + τ) is the intensity at some
time delay (τ) from time t, Veff is the effective focal volume, [C] is the average concentration of the particle, s represents the aspect ratio of the detection volume defined by the
axial height of the signal generation area (a) divided
by the spot radius (r, s = a/r), and τD is the characteristic
decay time. The decay time can be tied to the diffusion coefficient
(D) as shown in eq 3, which,
for particles undergoing Brownian motion, can be used to determine
the particle radius (r) given the laser beam waist
(r0) through the Stokes–Einstein
relation (eq 4).23,31 3   4  

The axial height parameter (a) in eq 2 is often empirically measured in traditional correlation
spectroscopy. The unique probe volume associated with SERS requires
a modification to commonly used models.23 Figure 2 depicts differences in the optical
geometry between conventional correlation spectroscopy and the experiments
described. In traditional correlation spectroscopy, the laser spot
radius (r) and the axial depth (a) of the focus define the effective focal volume. These two parameters
are combined in the focal volume shape parameter, s, for fitting correlation curves to eq 2.

Figure 2 Schematic
representation of optical geometries in traditional correlation
spectroscopy and SERCS, demonstrating the difference in axial component
of the signal generation volume. The red portion in the SERCS image
represents the extent of the SERS-enhanced field above the substrate.

Given that SERS is a short-range
effect (<10 nm),20,21 it would be inappropriate to
approximate the axial depth of the
excitation volume as a traditional 2-D Gaussian. The axial depth of
the signal-generating region is limited to the extent of propagation
of the SERS enhanced field away from the surface. That is, for a given
assembly to demonstrate a measurable signal fluctuation, it must approach
the surface within the SERS field. It has been demonstrated that the
SERS enhancement decays20 as 1/r10 or exponentially;21 however, both of these functions require either knowledge of the
nanoparticle radius20 or the SERS propagation
length.21 To calculate an approximate probe
volume, we have simplified the axial height to a fixed value. An approximated
axial height of 5 nm was selected for autocorrelation fits in these
studies on the basis of the magnitude and frequencies of the SERS
signals with different size particles (see below).

Figure 3A shows how the average derived
diffusion constant for a sample set of 150 nm DPPC vesicle curves
depends upon the height of the probe volume, holding the radial dimension
constant. The axial length can be adjusted as a fit parameter in eq 2, and generally, as the axial length is increased,
the diffusion constants extracted from the fit increase as shown.
The error in choosing a fixed axial height of 5 nm is relatively small
over the physically relevant range (Figure 3A inset) of values (0–10 nm) when compared with the errors
associated with fits to eq 2 or multiple measurements.

Figure 3 The average
diffusion constants calculated from a set of 150 nm
DPPC vesicle autocorrelation curves are plotted as a function of focal
volume fit parameters. (A) The average diffusion constant as a function
of the axial dimension with the radial dimension held constant at
176 nm. The inset plot shows the physically relevant region from a = 1–10 nm. (B) The average diffusion constant as
a function of the laser spot radius (r) with the
axial component (a) held constant at 5 nm. The blue
line in B represents the calculated Stokes–Einstein diffusion
constant based on the particle radius as determined by DLS. The red
circles in the plots represent the fit parameters used for the calculation
of diffusion constants for the whole of the data presented (r = 176 nm and z = 5 nm).

The second fit parameter is the radius of the collection
volume.
The spot radius in these experiments is best characterized as the
diffraction limited spot of the focusing objective. Essentially, there
are two distinct possibilities to define the lateral dimension of
the sample volume. First, if a specific hotspot was giving rise to
the signal, long bursts should be observed as the particle moves over
a tiny excitation volume. Alternatively, if the SERS signal is either
delocalized or arising from multiple hotspots, the effective lateral
area should correlate with the laser spot size. The short signal duration
observed, similarity of autocorrelation decays from particles of the
same size on separate SERS substrates, and our previous work showing
a uniform SERS and dark-field scattering intensities on the diffraction-limited
length scale18 supports the latter scenario.
Figure 3B shows that when the axial height
is fixed at 5 nm, the measured diffusion constant increases with respect
to the axial radius.

Figure 1D shows
autocorrelated traces for
each of the frequencies shown in Figure 1C.
Again, a model for three-dimensional Brownian motion was fit to the
autocorrected curves to determine the autocorrelation decay time (eq 2) and diffusion constant via eq 3. The fitting results are shown as dashed lines. Representative decay
times are determined by averaging all decay time values determined
from the intensity profiles that satisfy the Pearson’s r threshold, with the standard deviation serving as the
error. When the axial height (a) is approximated
to be the extension of the SERS field into solution (5 nm), the fits
shown for each of the aforementioned frequencies corresponds to an
average correlation decay time of 180 ± 99 ms.

Particles
sizes were independently measured using dynamic light
scattering. PS beads with reported diameters of 1100, 300, and 100
nm were found to have diameters of 890 ± 150, 440 ± 42,
and 110 ± 10 nm, corresponding to diffusion constants calculated
from eq 4 on the order of 10–8–10–9 cm2/s.

The average
SERCS correlation decay time of 180 ± 99 ms for
the 440 nm diameter PS beads in Figure 1 corresponds
to a diffusion coefficient of 4.27 ± 0.076 × 10–10 cm2/s (eq 3). The measured diffusion
constant is an order of magnitude slower than expected based on Stokes–Einstein
diffusion.

SERCS results were obtained for three PS bead samples,
and the
diffusion coefficients determined by SERCS and calculated from eq 3 are 1.10 ± 0.39 × 10–10, 4.98 ± 0.10 × 10–10, and 5.49 ±
0.12 × 10–10 cm2/s, respectively.
These diffusion coefficients represent the average value from all
frequencies satisfying the specified Pearson’s r criterion (n = 24–39). For each particle
size, the diffusion constant calculated from eq 4 using the particles size determined by DLS (10–8–10–9 cm2/s) is an order of magnitude
faster than the average diffusion constant determined by SERCS (10–10 cm2/s). These results indicate that all
sizes of PS particles are experiencing hindered diffusion at the SERS
surface.

DPPC Vesicles
Single-shell unilamellar vesicles (SUVs)
provide a means to verify how far the SERS enhancement extends from
the surface. SUVs are commonly used as models for lipid and cellular
membranes.32 The structure of a lipid vesicle
with hydrophobic headgroups on the exterior, a hydrocarbon layer of
approximately 4–5 nm between opposing headgroups, and a solution
filled center provide additional insight regarding the effective SERS
penetration depth in our sampling volume.

Figure 4 shows a representative kinetic series of 500 spectra with
175 nm DPPC vesicles collected at 31 Hz (25 ms acquisitions). Figure 4A shows the changes in the SERS spectrum with respect
to time. The inset spectrum shows a comparison between a reference
DPPC Raman spectrum and the SERS spectrum at t =
12.54 s. Intensities at 713, 1065, 1098, and 1298 cm–1 indicate the presence of a DPPC vesicle in the enhancing region.
These frequencies can be assigned to the choline (713 cm–1), carbon–carbon (1065 cm–1), and phosphate
stretches (1098 cm–1), and the C–H twist
(1298 cm–1) modes of DPPC.33,34 These vibrational modes are consistent with the functional groups
present in the head groups of DPPC molecule, which are situated on
the periphery of the vesicle. The headgroup dominant spectrum supports
the assertion that the extension of the SERS field into solution is
limited to a finite (<5 nm) length, which is effectively where
SERS no longer provides significant enhancement.

Figure 4 Sample heat map and spectrum
(inset) for correlation analysis of
DPPC vesicles (A). The inset spectra show a comparison of a DPPC reference
to the spectrum at t = 12.54 s. Panel B shows a comparison
of autocorrelation intensity curves at 1095 cm-1 and fits from vesicles
of four diameters: 750 (black), 580 (red), 170 (green), and 150 nm
(blue).

Lipid vesicles extruded through
polycarbonate membranes were found
to have diameters of 750 ± 35, 580 ± 220, 170 ± 31,
150 ± 51 via DLS. Figure 4, panel B demonstrates
the measurable difference in autocorrelation curves observed with
different size particles using SERCS. Autocorrelated 1095 cm–1 intensity traces for four DPPC vesicle sizes 750 (red), 580 (orange),
170 (green), and 150 nm (blue) are shown as dashed lines. The fit
of eq 2 to the data, with an approximation of
the axial height (a) to be SERS field extension of 5 nm, are shown
as solid lines corresponding to decay times of 1100 ± 180, 500
± 100, 160 ± 23, and 82 ± 17 ms, which correlate to
diffusion coefficients of 7.3 ± 1.4 × 10–11, 1.54 ± 0.08 × 10–10, 4.92 ± 0.02
× 10–10, and 9.43 ± 0.01 × 10–10 cm2/s. Similarly to PS, the calculated
diffusion constants for DPPC are slower than predicted by Stokes–Einstein
diffusion. In addition, the data demonstrate a measurable difference
in the diffusion constant for different size particles, as determined
via SERCS.

In addition to the headgroup dominant spectrum observed
for DPPC,
the limited SERS decay length can be further corroborated by the intensity
of the spectral data observed. The number of oscillators sampled should
increase with the extent of the SERS enhancing field and, thus, improve
the signal-to-noise ratio from particles interacting in this region.
Shown in Figure 5 is the measured signal-to-noise
ratio as a function of bead or vesicle radius. For PS beads, the average
signal-to-noise was calculated from profiles at 1009 cm–1 whereas 1065 cm–1 was used for DPPC vesicles.
The standard deviations from these averages are represented as error
bars. Contrary to the expected trend, the observed signal-to-noise
ratio decreases as particle radius increases. The average signal-to-noise
ratios for DPPC vesicles with radii of 76, 87, 292, and 377 nm were
measured to be 13 ± 3, 8 ± 2, 7 ± 2 and 7 ± 1.
The decrease in intensity can be explained by increased Rayleigh scattering
of the excitation laser by larger particles, decreasing the incident
laser power onto the SERS surface. This diminished incident power
decreases the local electric field strength that gives rise to the
SERS signal as well as the probability of observing a particle.

Figure 5 Plot of measured
signal-to-noise ratios for PS beads (blue) and
DPPC vesicles (red) at 1009 and 1065 cm-1, respectively, as a function
of particle radius. Inset plot shows sample profiles for DPPC of four
particle radii: 377 (black), 292 (red), 87 (green), and 76 nm (blue).

Since the surface area of a spherical
cap of a defined height scales
linearly with particle radius, the negligible increase in signal with
larger particle indicates the SERS signal must arise from a very small
height, on the order of 5 nm (or less), as used in our analysis. The
decrease in power from Rayleigh scattering is expected to be small;
however, it appears to be the dominant effect as the change in SERS
signal with increased surface area, or correspondingly number of molecules,
is negligible. The scattering of the incident radiation also imposes
a concentration limit to which this analysis can be applied. Only
sufficiently dilute, or homogeneous solutions, can be analyzed via
this reflection geometry.

The combined results from multiple
measurements on different substrates
and the determination of particle diffusion coefficients are shown
in Figure 6. The coefficients were calculated
on the basis of decay times from multiple spectral frequencies using
the confined sensing volume (height = 5 nm) characteristic of SERS.
The blue squares show results for PS beads the red circles for DPPC
vesicles. A trend line for the combined data set show that, as expected
on the basis of eq 4, the measured diffusion
constant trends as 1/r with respect to particle radius.
On average, the observed SERCS diffusion constants are at least 40
times slower than those predicted by Stokes–Einstein diffusion.

Figure 6 Plot of
the average measured diffusion constant vs particle size
for PS beads (blue) and DPPC vesicles (red) with an axial height (a)
of 5 nm. The dotted line shows a 1/r function fit
to the aggregated data.

Discussion
The results presented above indicate that
SERCS can be used to
gain information about analytes interacting with the SERS substrate.
From the parameters measured, the relative size of the interacting
particle can be assessed, but also, the absorptive interactions with
the surface can be monitored.

Particle Sizing and Surface Diffusion Measurements
Correlation analysis is commonly used to determine the size of
particles
based on Stokes–Einstein diffusion. Although SERCS offers advantages
over previous reports of correlation spectroscopy utilizing Raman
spectroscopy, its utility for absolute particle sizing is debatable.
The signal enhancement provided by the SERS substrate allows for collection
of entire SERS spectra on the order of milliseconds, enabling selectivity
between multiple species by distinguishing between the analyte in
question and contaminants. The qualitative difference in the signals
from different size particles is demonstrated in Figures 4 and 6; however, our results
indicate that Stokes–Einstein diffusion is not observed on
SERS substrates. Qualitative changes associated with particle size
are observed, but the interactions at the surface inhibit the use
of eq 4 for determining quantitative particle
sizes or diffusion constants. Absent of prior knowledge of the particle
sizes in this study, determination of size would be difficult, if
not impossible; however relative changes in diffusion associated with
size can be addressed.

SERCS has other advantages for monitoring
diffusion. The ability to perform cross-correlation analysis allows
us to statistically determine which modes exhibit the same temporal
behavior and can thus be attributed to a single species. This addition
decreases the error associated with the measurements. Further, the
laser powers used in this study are an order of magnitude less than
those reported for RCS,24 lessening perturbation,
a benefit when this methodology is applied to photo- or temperature-sensitive
systems.

The range of accessible particle sizes that can be
interrogated
with substrate-based SERCS is limited by two factors: First, the lower
limit is tied to the readout time of the EMCCD camera. Particles or
molecules that diffuse through the signal generation volume faster
than the minimum read time are problematic. Second, the elastic light
scattering of particles increases with both size and concentrations.
Our results above suggest the upper limit of particle size analysis
is related to the wavelength of light used for measurements and, thus,
the extent of scattering, as shown in Figure 5. As presented, the range of concentrations that can be interrogated
is also limited. If the particle or vesicle concentration is to small,
the probability of a particle having a fruitful interaction with the
surface is decreased, leading to a poor sampling statistics. Conversely,
if the particle concentration is too large, scattering of both the
excitation and scattered light by particles in solution decreases
the probability of observing signal.

Implications for SERS Detection
The observed SERS signals
indicate that the enhancement does not extend more than a few nanometers
from the SERS substrate. The headgroup dominated DPPC SERS spectra
in Figure 4 and changes in signal-to-noise
with particle size in Figure 5 support the
assertion that the SERS enhancement is highly confined to the substrate
surface. It is interesting to note that the signal fluctuations detected
all suggest impeded diffusion at the surface. Previous reports on
the penetration depth of SERS used reporter groups attached at fixed
distances from the surface.20,21 In our study, the particles
are free to diffuse away, yet the signals observed suggest the SERS
signal arises from particles that show a favorable, adsorptive, interaction
at the surface.

The size of the particles detected requires
the signals observed to originate from extra-hot spot enhancements.
The signal enhancements observed from rhodamine molecules on nanoparticle
aggregates support the existence of such enhancements.16 In addition, calculations by Schatz show that
an oscillating dipole outside of the gap region can evince a large
scattered field.35 Molecular absorption
was reported to increase SERS limits of detection for analytes in
flowing solutions.36 The hindered diffusion
associated with SERCS detection suggests physisorption or other interactions
to the SERS substrate. Because the particles detected are all too
large to fit into nanogaps, our results suggest these extra-hotspot
enhancements may require molecules to be in physical contact with
or confined within a couple nanometers of the nanostructures.

The observation of significant SERS beyond hotspots suggests extended
utility for chemical sensing. Our results suggest that the enhanced
Raman scattering arises from molecules adsorbed or confined near the
enhancing nanostructured surface. It is known that finite element
calculations fail at distances less than 1 nm from the surface.37 Thus, molecules adsorbing to the surface may
experience larger than predicted enhancements.

Conclusions
Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy has been utilized to facilitate
rapid spectral acquisition from 30 to 80 Hz. When combined with auto-
and cross-correlation analysis, rapid spectral acquisition affords
the ability to monitor and measure interactions between 100 and 1000
nm diameter particles diffusing in solution and a planar SERS substrate.
Measurements of particle diffusion constants show that detected particles
are experiencing hindered diffusion at the surface, suggesting that
the observed SERS signals arise from a physical interaction between
the particles and the SERS substrate. This method provides a chemically
specific means of monitoring surface interactions and dynamics on
chemically and biochemically relevant time scales.
