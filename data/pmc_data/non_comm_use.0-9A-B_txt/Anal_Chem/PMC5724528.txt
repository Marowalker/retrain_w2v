There
is significant interest in developing analytical methods
to characterize molecular recognition events between proteins and
phosphoinositides, which are a medically important class of carbohydrate-functionalized
lipids. Within this scope, one area of high priority involves quantitatively
evaluating drug candidates that pharmacologically inhibit protein–phosphoinositide
interactions. As full-length proteins are often difficult to produce,
establishing methods to study these interactions with shorter, bioactive
peptides would be advantageous. Herein, we report an atomic force
microscopy (AFM)-based force spectroscopic approach to detect the
specific interaction between an amphipathic, α-helical (AH)
peptide derived from the hepatitis C virus NS5A protein and its biological
target, the phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] phosphoinositide receptor. After optimization of the peptide
tethering strategy and measurement parameters, the binding specificity
of AH peptide for PI(4,5)P2 receptors was comparatively
evaluated across a panel of phosphoinositides and the influence of
ionic strength on AH–PI(4,5)P2 binding strength
was tested. Importantly, these capabilities were translated into the
development of a novel experimental methodology to determine the inhibitory
activity of a small-molecule drug candidate acting against the AH–PI(4,5)P2 interaction, and extracted kinetic parameters agree well
with literature values obtained by conventional biochemical methods.
Taken together, our findings provide a nanomechanical basis for explaining
the high binding specificity of the NS5A AH to PI(4,5)P2 receptors, in turn establishing an analytical framework to study
phosphoinositide-binding viral peptides and proteins as well as a
broadly applicable approach to evaluate candidate inhibitors of protein–phosphoinositide
interactions.

==== Body
Phosphoinositides are carbohydrate-functionalized
lipids that play important roles in a wide range of biological processes
related to signaling, metabolism, and membrane trafficking, among
other activities.1−3 Phosphoinositide molecules are characterized by an
inositol ring, which can be phosphorylated at one or more ring positions
by kinases and phosphatases, and this carbohydrate moiety (known as
the inositol phosphate) is linked to diacylglycerol via a phosphodiester
linkage.3 There are numerous inositide-binding
domains found in proteins that recognize different phosphoinositides
on the basis of the molecular structure of the phosphorylated inositol
ring, that is, the number and position of the phosphate groups.4,5 Regarded as a key class of protein–carbohydrate interactions,
protein–phosphoinositide interactions occur through specific
binding between a protein’s binding pocket and a phosphoinositide
molecule6 or through more promiscuous multivalent
interactions based on electrostatic attraction between a protein surface
and several phosphoinositide molecules.7 Unraveling the details of these interactions is highly nuanced,
depending on the system under consideration,8 and numerous analytical tools have been developed to monitor phosphoinositide
synthesis9 and phosphorylation steps,10 to determine the location and quantity of phosphoinositides
in cellular membranes,11,12 and to probe these interactions
with real-time monitoring.13−15 The development of new analytical
tools to study protein–phosphoinositide interactions remains
an important need, especially in terms of evaluating pharmacological
strategies to treat phosphoinositide-associated diseases of importance
to human health and medicine.16−18

There is growing evidence
that phosphoinositides are critically
involved in the life cycles of medically important viruses.19 A classic example is the phosphatidylinositol
(4,5)-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] lipid, which directs the
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag protein to plasma
membranes as part of the process to create new virus particles.20 Recently, it was discovered that PI(4,5)P2 also plays an important role in the life cycle of the hepatitis
C virus (HCV) by interacting with the N-terminal amphipathic α-helix
(AH) of the HCV nonstructural 5A (NS5A) protein as part of viral genome
replication.21−23 In particular, it was reported that the NS5A AH specifically
binds intracellular PI(4,5)P2, which is necessary for viral
genome replication.24 A pair of positively
charged lysine residues flanking a hydrophobic face within the NS5A
AH was required for PI(4,5)P2 binding and genome replication,
leading to identification of the basic amino acid PI(4,5)P2 pincer (BAAPP) domain.24 While there
are other known structural motifs that mediate PI(4,5)P2 binding,25 none of these were present
in the NS5A AH. BAAPP domains are not unique to HCV, however, and
appear to be widespread among pathogen and even host cell proteins.24 The role of PI(4,5)P2 in the HCV
life cycle represents the first example of phosphoinositides mediating
viral genome replication. Understanding mechanistic details about
the NS5A AH–PI(4,5)P2 interaction can provide insights
into the viral life cycle and identify novel antiviral strategies
targeting this interaction.

Toward this goal, a quantitative
measurement strategy is needed
to unravel the factors that contribute to the specificity and strength
of the interaction between NS5A AH and PI(4,5)P2 receptors.
Developing such capabilities would also be useful for evaluating small-molecule
inhibitors and other drug candidates. While a large number of qualitative
and semiquantitative methods have been developed for studying protein–carbohydrate
interactions in general,26−28 precise determination of binding
affinities is difficult to achieve with conventional measurement approaches
that rely on ensemble averaging26,29 and typically have
large errors.30−32 One promising approach involves direct measurement
of the binding forces between individual proteins and carbohydrate
moieties by atomic force microscopy (AFM) force spectroscopy.33−35 Touhami et al.36 first reported AFM force
spectroscopic measurements of specific lectin–carbohydrate
interactions involving the concanavalin A protein, and the corresponding
binding forces are known to be weaker than those associated with antibody–antigen
interactions.37 Other protein–carbohydrate
interactions also have relatively weak binding forces,38 highlighting the importance of multivalency
in protein–carbohydrate systems.39 Among phosphoinositides, Malkovskiy et al.40 have measured the interaction between the PLCδ/1PH protein
and PI(4,5)P2 molecules and determined similar binding
force values. While the feasibility of measuring protein–carbohydrate
interactions by AFM force spectroscopy has been demonstrated, important
shortcomings remain to be addressed. To date, all relevant studies
have utilized full-length proteins, and extending this approach to
shorter bioactive peptides, as has been done for peptide–nucleic
acid systems,41,42 would greatly advance measurement
capabilities, especially for proteins that are difficult to produce.
Indeed, recombinant expression and purification of full-length HCV
NS5A protein is technically challenging,43 and the N-terminal AH is often not included.44,45 Hence, establishing measurement approaches based on synthetic bioactive
peptides would be broadly useful and could provide a tractable means
to examine NS5A AH BAAPP domain–phosphoinositide interactions.
Another important unrealized opportunity relates to applying these
analytical technologies to quantitatively evaluate the efficacy of
candidate inhibitors that antagonize protein–phosphoinositide
interactions.

Herein, we report AFM force spectroscopic measurements
for characterizing
the interaction between an amphipathic α-helical peptide comprising
the NS5A AH BAAPP domain (termed AH peptide) and substrate-bound PI(4,5)P2 receptors, as well as its pharmacological inhibition by a
small-molecule drug candidate. A polymer-based tethering strategy
was utilized for peptide immobilization to the probe tip, and various
measurement parameters were optimized for sensing performance, including
the peptide coating density and contact time between the probe tip
and substrate. With the optimized measurement settings, the binding
specificity of AH BAAPP domain to PI(4,5)P2 receptors was
evaluated across a panel of phosphoinositides and the influence of
ionic strength on the AH–PI(4,5)P2 binding interaction
was tested. Following this approach, we investigated the potential
of a small-molecule drug candidate, neomycin, to inhibit the AH–PI(4,5)P2 binding interaction, and we were also able to extract the
association constant for the monovalent interaction between neomycin
and PI(4,5)P2 receptors. Taken together, our findings establish
a measurement platform for evaluating molecular recognition events
between short bioactive peptides and phosphoinositide receptors, identify
the importance of nonelectrostatic factors in driving the high binding
specificity of the NS5A AH BAAPP domain for PI(4,5)P2 receptors,
and offer a new experimental approach for evaluating the inhibitory
activity and quantitative binding characteristics of small-molecule
drug candidates.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, pH 7.4; Life
Technologies Corp., Carlsbad, CA), ethanol (Merck Millipore, Billerica,
MA), dehydrated toluene (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 2-aminoethanethiol
(Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan), N-hydroxysuccinimide-[poly(ethylene
glycol)]24-maleimide ester (NHS-PEG24-MAL, 95%
purity; Quanta Biodesign, Plain City, OH), m-dPEG24-NHS
(NHS-PEG24-OMe, 98% purity; Quanta Biodesign), and polyoxyethylene
sorbitan monolaurate (Tween-20, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) were used in
the experiments. All other laboratory-grade chemicals were obtained
from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise noted.
Phosphoinositide strips for protein–lipid interaction analysis
were obtained from Echelon Biosciences (catalog no. P-6001; Salt Lake
City, UT) and contain 100 pmol of each compound in the highly purified
lipid form (diC16). The strips were stored at 4 °C
in a dark environment per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Before experiment, the strips were incubated for 1 h in PBS solution
containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 in order to passivate nonspecific hydrophobic
interactions and then extensively rinsed with PBS solution while remaining
immersed in liquid throughout the subsequent AFM experiments. The
AH peptide was obtained from Anaspec Corp. (San Jose, CA), where it
was synthesized by conventional fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc)
solid-phase peptide synthesis and purified to >95% by reversed-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography. The AH peptide’s amino
acid sequence is H-Ser-Gly-Ser-Trp-Leu-Arg-Asp-Val-Trp-Asp-Trp-Ile-Cys-Thr-Val-Leu-Thr-Asp-Phe-Lys-Thr-Trp-Leu-Gln-Ser-Lys-Leu-NH2. All solutions were prepared by using Milli-Q-treated water
(Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA).

Tip Functionalization
Rectangular-shaped, single-crystal
silicon cantilevers (CSG-01, NT-MDT, Moscow, Russia) with ∼0.03
N/m nominal spring constant were used to measure the peptide–phosphoinositide
binding interaction. The as-supplied probe tip was coated with a 3-nm-thick
adhesion layer of titanium, followed by a 35-nm-thick gold layer.
The coated tip’s radius of curvature is approximately 35 nm.
The gold-coated tips were extensively rinsed with ethanol, dried with
a stream of nitrogen gas, and then subjected to oxygen plasma treatment
(PSD-UV Benchtop UV–ozone cleaner, Novascan, Ames, IA). The
oxygen plasma-treated tips were then incubated in 10 mM 2-aminoethanethiol
in ethanol for 6 h. After incubation, the tips were washed with pure
ethanol solution, dried with a stream of nitrogen gas, and next immersed
in anhydrous toluene solution containing 1 mM NHS-PEG24-MAL for 6 h, as previously described.46,47 Afterward,
the immersed tips were rinsed with sequential anhydrous toluene and
ethanol washing steps and dried with nitrogen gas. Finally, the tips
were incubated overnight in a PBS buffer solution containing 52 μM
AH peptide, and immediately before each experiment, the functionalized
tips were gently rinsed with PBS solution.

Force Spectroscopic Measurements
Measurements were
performed on a commercial AFM instrument (NX-Bio, Park Systems, Suwon,
South Korea), as previously described.48 For force mapping data set acquisition, the resolution was set at
16 × 16 points with a scan area of 10 × 10 μm2, generating 256 force curves per data set. The approach and
retract speeds of the AFM cantilever were set at 1000 nm/s with a
maximum loading force of 3 nN. To quantify the force–distance
curves, the experimentally measured spring constant of each individual
AFM cantilever was determined by the thermal vibration method,49 and the values were typically around 0.043 N/m.
All force spectroscopic experiments were performed at room temperature
in the appropriate aqueous buffer solution (PBS unless otherwise noted).
For force curve analysis, data organization was conducted by use of
the XEI v1.8.2 software program (Park Systems), and calculation of
the adhesion force and rupture length was done with a custom-written
script in Python (available upon request). Force–distance curves
with a maximum adhesion force between 0 and 1200 pN and rupture length
between 1 and 80 nm were selected for data analysis. The most probable
adhesion forces and rupture lengths were determined by fitting a Gaussian
curve to histogram plots of all rupture events within these criteria,
and the statistical error was estimated as 2.35σ/, where σ is the standard
deviation
and N is the number of rupture events in the set.50 The interaction probability was also detected
by classifying specific rupture events as possessing rupture lengths
between 6 and 20 nm, whereas events with shorter or longer rupture
lengths were classified as nonspecific interactions.51

Results and Discussion
Platform Design
A covalent tethering strategy based
on a flexible, heterobifunctional cross-linker was utilized to attach
AH peptide to the probe tip,46−48 as presented in Figure 1. First, a gold-coated probe
tip was functionalized with 2-aminoethanethiol via gold–sulfur
dative bonding,52 which resulted in the
presentation of free amine groups on the tip surface. Subsequently,
the amine-functionalized tip was coated with NHS-PEG24-MAL,
where NHS, PEG, and MAL refer to N-hydroxysuccinimide,
poly(ethylene glycol) polymer, and maleimide ester, respectively,
and the NHS functional group covalently reacts with amine groups on
the tip surface. The functionalized tip was then incubated with AH
peptide,53 leading to covalent conjugation
of the peptide by formation of stable thioether linkages between free
maleimide groups on the PEG chains and the cysteine residue of AH
peptide. In particular, the cysteine residue has a free sulfhydryl
group that forms an irreversible covalent bond with a maleimide group
under the experimental conditions.54

bioactive AH peptide. (i) A gold-coated AFM tip is used for surface
functionalization. (ii) Coating with 2-aminoethanethiol results in
presentation of free amine groups on the tip surface. (iii) Coating
with NHS-PEG24-MAL is achieved by covalent reaction between N-hydroxysuccinimide and surface-exposed amine groups, with
free maleimide esters remaining exposed. (iv) The cysteine residue
of AH peptide is conjugated to the PEG-based tether by reaction with
a maleimide ester group to form a stable thioether linkage. Note that
schematic components are not drawn to scale.

The sensing performance of the peptide-coated probe tips
was then
evaluated by conducting AFM force spectroscopic measurements on phosphoinositide-coated
hydrophobic surfaces containing PI(4,5)P2 molecules (Figure 2a,b). A representative
force–distance curve of the AH–PI(4,5)P2 interaction
is presented in Figure 2c and shows a rupture length of around 13 nm, which is consistent
with the PEG24 spacer’s length of ∼9.4 nm
along with the spatial proximity of the cysteine residue relative
to the BAAPP domain (∼2 nm) and some degree of unfolding of
the peptide’s α-helical character during the retraction
step (∼2 nm).46,55 The force required to break the
AH–PI(4,5)P2 interaction is around 180 pN, which
is within the range of other protein–carbohydrate interactions.36−38 By contrast, when the tip was not functionalized with AH peptide,
there was no specific interaction between the tip and PI(4,5)P2 molecules, demonstrating that the detected interaction is
mediated by the AH ligand (Figure 2d). The corresponding histograms of individual rupture
events, denoted by the associated adhesion force and rupture length,
are presented for the two cases, with and without AH pepetide, in Figure 2 panels e and f,
respectively. While most individual rupture events exhibited characteristic
adhesion force and rupture length pairs, larger forces were observed
in some cases and coincident with larger rupture lengths, indicating
multiple rupture events and/or nonspecific interactions. The analyzed
histogram data were collected from over 100 force–distance
curves per experimental set.

curves are presented for the two cases in panels a and b, respectively.

from which the most probable values and their corresponding errors
were computed.

Optimization of Peptide
Coating Density and Contact Time
To clarify how the avidity
of AH–PI(4,5)P2 interactions
influences the measurement response, we systematically investigated
the effect of peptide coating density on the measured adhesion force
(Figure 3). This was
achieved by coating the tip with a mixture of NHS-PEG24-MAL and a monofunctional PEG cross-linker (NHS-PEG24-OMe)
that possesses an N-hydroxysuccinimide functional
group and a methoxy (OMe) terminus on its other end. As a result,
NHS-PEG24-OMe can attach to the probe tip but there are
no remaining functional groups for peptide attachment. In the case
of 0 mol % NHS-PEG24-MAL, there was no attached peptide
and the resulting most probable adhesion force was 43 pN, which is
attributed to weak, nonspecific adhesion events in this system (Figure 3a). On the other
hand, at 20 mol % NHS-PEG24-MAL, the most probable adhesion
force increased to 86 pN, which is indicative of some specific AH–PI(4,5)P2 interactions beyond force values associated with nonspecific
binding events alone. At higher NHS-PEG24-MAL fractions
(50% and 100%), the most probable adhesion force reached saturation
values around 175–185 pN, indicating a greater fraction of
specific AH–PI(4,5)P2 interactions. Importantly,
the trend in measured adhesion forces correlated with the probability
of specific binding events, which was highest for the 100 mol % NHS-PEG24-MAL case at around 79% (Figure 3b). Collectively, the findings support that
the most probable adhesion force and event probability of the AH–PI(4,5)P2 interaction are influenced by the peptide coating density,
and for all subsequent studies reported below, the NHS-PEG24-MAL coating density was fixed at 100%.

Figure 3 Effect of peptide coating
density on AH–PI(4,5)P2 binding interaction. (a)
Most probable adhesion force and (b) event
probability (percentage of specific binding events) for the AH–PI(4,5)P2 binding interaction are expressed as a function of the molar
percentage of NHS-PEG24-MAL used for tip coating. The remaining
percentage is composed of NHS-PEG24-OMe that does not bind
to AH peptides.

Following these observations,
we next optimized the time duration
(denoted as contact time) during which the probe tip remains in contact
with the PI(4,5)P2-coated surface. While the time scale
of structural changes within peptides is typically on the order of
tens to hundreds of nanoseconds,56 the
tethering of peptides in force spectroscopic measurements reduces
the degree of spatial freedom, so a sufficiently long contact time
is necessary for promoting specific adhesion events. Figure 4 presents representative deflection
curves, most probable adhesion forces, and most probable rupture lengths
for force spectroscopic measurements conducted at different contact
times: 0.1, 1, and 3 s. The deflection curves are shown in Figure 4a–c. At 0.1
s contact time, the most probable adhesion force was 54.0 ± 14.0
pN, which is comparable to the nonspecific binding case and supports
that there is insufficient contact time to promote specific binding
interactions (Figure 4d). With a 1 s contact time, the most probable adhesion force increased
to 179.1 ± 13.1 pN, which is well above the background signal
(Figure 4e). In both
the 0.1 and 1 s contact time cases, the typical rupture lengths were
similar, around 11.4 ± 1.6 and 14.8 ± 1.7 nm, respectively,
and consistent with expected rupture lengths in the 10–15 nm
range as described. On the other hand, with a 3 s contact time, the
most probable adhesion force increased to 248.7 ± 20.3 pN; however,
the typical rupture length was significantly larger, around 35.1 ±
2.9 nm, and a large number of multiple rupture events were detected,
unlike the predominantly single rupture events observed for shorter
contact times (Figure 4f). Therefore, to focus on the specific AH–PI(4,5)P2 interaction, we selected a 1 s contact time for subsequent experiments
due to the combination of a suitably large, most probable adhesion
force and typical rupture lengths that are consistent with detecting
single rupture events in this system. In addition, the dependence
of measured adhesion force on contact time supports that the AH–PI(4,5)P2 interaction is relatively slow and likely involves significant
changes in the peptide’s molecular structure. These observations
are in line with previous biochemical results indicating that the
AH peptide undergoes a conformational change upon PI(4,5)P2 binding.24

contact time on AH–PI(4,5)P2 binding interaction.
Different contact times were tested:
0.1, 1, and 3 s. (a–c) Representative measurement traces show
the cantilever deflection as a function of time, including the time
span during which tip–substrate contact occurs. (d–f)
Adhesion force histograms are presented for the AH–PI(4,5)P2 binding interaction, and the most probable adhesion forces
and corresponding errors are presented as well.

Evaluation of Phosphoinositide Binding Specificity
With
the optimized measurement settings, we next investigated the
specificity of AH binding interaction to PI(4,5)P2 receptors
as compared to other phosphoinositide receptors with different degrees
of phosphorylation at various ring positions. The tested receptors
were PI, PI(3)P, PI(4)P, PI(5)P, PI(3,4)P2, PI(3,5)P2, PI(4,5)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3. As presented
in Figure 5a, the AH
peptide demonstrated particularly strong binding to PI(4,5)P2, with a most probable adhesion force around 205 pN in this set.
By contrast, there were appreciably weaker interactions between the
AH and other phosphoinositide bisphosphates [PI(3,4)P2 and
PI(3,5)P2] despite their having similar surface potentials
to the negatively charged PI(4,5)P2. The only difference
is the geometrical positions of the two phosphate groups on the inositol
ring. The most probable adhesion forces for AH binding to PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,5)P2 receptors were around 97 and 47
pN, respectively. In addition, the most probable adhesion force of
AH binding to PI(3,4,5)P3 was 58 pN, whereas binding to
other phosphoinositides, PI, PI(3)P, PI(4)P, and PI(5)P, was fully
negligible (<40 pN). Altogether, these findings demonstrate that
the AH has a specific binding interaction with PI(4,5)P2 receptors that can be selectively detected by force spectroscopic
measurements.

Figure 5 Specificity of AH peptide binding to PI(4,5)P2 receptors.
(a) Most probable adhesion forces for AH peptide binding to different
phosphoinositide receptors. (b) Effect of ionic strength on most probable
adhesion force of AH–PI(4,5)P2 binding interaction.
In this experimental series, the buffer solution was 10 mM Tris (pH
7.5), and ionic strength was adjusted by varying the NaCl concentration.

To better understand the role
of electrostatic forces in phosphoinositide
binding, the effect of ionic strength on the AH–PI(4,5)P2 binding interaction was systematically investigated by varying
the NaCl concentration between 0 and 250 mM NaCl (Figure 5b). With increasing ionic strength,
the most probable adhesion force decreased from 331.0 ± 16.6
pN at 0 mM NaCl to 143.6 ± 10.5 pN at 250 mM NaCl. These findings
are consistent with charge-shielding arguments whereby the surface
potentials of positively charged lysine residues in the BAAPP domain
and negatively charged phosphate groups in the phosphoinositide molecules
become attenuated at higher ionic strengths. As a result, the magnitude
of the attractive electrostatic force is expected to become weaker
with increasing ionic strength (shorter Debye length).57 While a significant decrease in the adhesion
force is observed due to charge-shielding effects, it should be emphasized
that the resulting magnitude is still significantly greater than those
corresponding to nonspecific interactions of AH with other phosphoinositide
receptors when tested under equivalent solution conditions. Hence,
the findings reinforce that the AH–PI(4,5)P2 binding
interaction is strongly influenced by nonelectrostatic forces, and
the relative contribution of electrostatic forces to the total interaction
force depends on the ionic strength. As mentioned earlier, these findings
are consistent with the fact that the AH undergoes a conformational
change upon PI(4,5)P2 binding, and initial electrostatic
attraction between positively charged amino acid residues in the BAAPP
domain and negatively charged phosphate groups of the PI(4,5)P2 molecule is the first step in this process. As with other
protein–phosphoinositide interactions, it should be remarked
that optimal hydrogen-bonding contacts between amino acid residues
and the two phosphate groups on the phosphoinositide molecule likely
contribute to the high binding specificity.58

Evaluation of Small-Molecule Drug Inhibitor
Our foregoing
observations establish that the AFM measurement platform is capable
of detecting and quantifying PI(4,5)P2 binding by the NS5A
AH ligand in a highly specific manner. We next asked if the AH–PI(4,5)P2 binding interaction could serve as a competitive probe to
measure the association constant of phosphoinositide-binding small
molecules that might be promising drug candidates. Indeed, as the
force spectroscopic measurement is probing interactions between AH
ligands and PI(4,5)P2 receptor pairs, it would be expected
that occupancy of a fraction of receptor sites by a phosphoinositide-binding
small molecule might influence the measurement response (Figure 6a). Such capabilities
would be useful for quantitative biochemical analysis of phosphoinositide–small-molecule
interactions as well as for evaluating potential antiviral drug candidates
that interfere with AH–PI(4,5)P2 binding.

number of available receptor sites. (b) Representative adhesion force
maps obtained for AH–PI(4,5)P2 binding interaction

Maps were obtained in 2 μm × 2 μm with a lateral

a function of bulk neomycin concentration. (e) Percentage of AH–PI(4,5)P2 binding inhibition as a function of bulk neomycin concentration.
The EC50 value was computed from a 4PL fit.

To explore this possibility, we investigated how
neomycin, an aminoglycoside
antibiotic that is known to bind PI(4,5)P2 receptors,59 affects AH–PI(4,5)P2 binding.
For these experiments, various concentrations of free neomycin (100
nM–1 mM) were incubated with the phosphoinositide array for
1 h to allow equilibration of free and bound neomycin prior to each
AFM experiment, and then adhesion force measurements were conducted
under equilibrated solution conditions. Representative adhesion force
maps (2 μm × 2 μm) obtained in the presence of different
neomycin concentrations show the force magnitudes obtained at different
pixel positions, indicating a transition from high adhesion forces
corresponding to strong specific binding at low neomycin concentrations
to weak nonspecific interactions at higher neomycin concentrations60 (Figure 6b). A low concentration of neomycin (100 nM) did not affect
the binding interaction, and the recorded measurement values in this
case were comparable to conventional AH–PI(4,5)P2 binding (adhesion force of ∼225 pN). On the other hand, higher
concentrations of neomycin (1–10 μM) exhibited dose-dependent
inhibition of AH–PI(4,5)P2 binding. With increasing
neomycin concentration across this range, the most probable adhesion
force decreased from 194.2 ± 11.1 to 64.5 ± 14.3 pN (Figure 6c). Above this concentration
range (≥100 μM neomycin), the measured adhesion forces
for AH–PI(4,5)P2 binding reached a stable minimum
value that was comparable to the magnitude of nonspecific adhesion
events (∼48 pN). Hence, competitive binding of neomycin to
PI(4,5)P2 receptors inhibited specific AH–PI(4,5)P2 binding due to neomycin molecules occupying PI(4,5)P2 receptor sites. The sharp transition in adhesion force data
as a function of neomycin concentration suggests that the measurement
approach may be probing single-molecule binding events.

Based
on the adhesion force data, the probability of specific binding
events was determined; it ranged from 84% at 0.1 μM neomycin
to 20% at 1000 μM neomycin (Figure 6d). From these data, an efficacy curve of
neomycin’s inhibitory activity was constructed as a function
of drug concentration (Figure 6e). The 0% and 100% efficacy levels were defined as the event
probability corresponding to typical AH–PI(4,5)P2 binding (∼79%) and the event probability of no specific interaction
(NHS-PEG24-MAL without AH peptide) (∼15%), respectively.
Following this approach, the 50% efficacy concentration (EC50) of neomycin was determined to be 2.05 μM. As neomycin binds
to PI(4,5)P2 in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio,61 the EC50 value corresponds to the
bulk concentration of neomycin at which 50% of the PI(4,5)P2 receptor sites are occupied. From this result, we can calculate
the apparent association constant, Ka,
which equals the reciprocal of the neomycin concentration that binds
50% of PI(4,5)P2 receptor sites. The calculated Ka value of 4.88 × 105 M–1 agrees well with literature values obtained by conventional
biochemical methods (1–7 × 105 M–1).62,63 Of note, Živković et al.64 previously attempted to use AFM force spectroscopy
to measure the effect of 100 mM neomycin inhibitor on peptide–RNA
binding interactions, but they still detected some specific peptide–RNA
binding events despite the neomycin concentrations being well in excess
(by a factor of 5 × 104) of the corresponding dissociation
constant. From this viewpoint, our findings reveal for the first time
that, by utilizing the AH–PI(4,5)P2 binding interaction
as a competitive probe, AFM force spectroscopic measurements can distinguish
the extent of neomycin’s inhibitory activity at drug concentrations
5 orders of magnitude lower than previously observed in other AFM
force spectroscopic systems and provide quantitative readouts of equilibrium
binding constants for phosphoinositide–small-molecule interactions.

Conclusion
In summary, we have established an AFM force
spectroscopic platform
to quantitatively measure molecular-level interactions between amphipathic
peptides and phosphoinositide molecules. The measurement platform
was able to detect highly specific binding events while avoiding false
positives from weaker nonspecific interactions, even when phosphoinositide
molecules in the two cases have nearly identical physicochemical properties.
In the present context of exploring the NS5A AH BAAPP domain, these
findings provided a nanomechanical basis for explaining the high binding
specificity of NS5A AH to PI(4,5)P2 receptors, including
the importance of nonelectrostatic factors. Importantly, these capabilities
could also be translated into the development of a novel experimental
methodology to determine the inhibitory activity of small-molecule
drug candidates acting against the AH–PI(4,5)P2 interaction.
Proof-of-concept experiments with the neomycin inhibitor demonstrated
that this small molecule acts via competitive binding to PI(4,5)P2 receptors, and the measured association constant for the
neomycin–PI(4,5)P2 interaction agreed well with
literature values obtained by conventional biochemical methods. In
light of these demonstrated capabilities for force spectroscopic profiling,
there is enormous potential for utilizing this measurement approach
to explore protein–phosphoinositide interactions in membranous
environments, to understand how amino acid residues within the BAAPP
domain influence PI(4,5)P2 binding specificity and related
biological activities, and to further characterize drug candidates
that act against either PI(4,5)P2 receptors or AH ligands.
As AFM force spectroscopic experiments require significant time for
performing the measurements and completing data analysis, they offer
a complementary tool to traditional, ensemble-average assay formats
and provide a highly focused approach with advanced capabilities to
quantitatively characterize individual biomacromolecular interactions
with statistically rich information. Looking forward, this work contributes
an analytical framework to study phosphoinositide-binding peptides
and proteins as well as a broadly applicable approach to evaluate
candidate pharmacological inhibitors.
