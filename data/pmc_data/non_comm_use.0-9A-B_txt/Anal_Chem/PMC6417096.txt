High mobility group
box 1 (HMGB1) is a non-histone chromosomal
protein, which can be secreted through a variety of pathways and bind
to pattern recognition receptors to release pro-inflammatory cytokines.
Previous studies have suggested that HMGB1 is upregulated in numerous
inflammatory diseases and that it could be a biomarker for such diseases.
However, these studies used immunoassay-based methods to analyze serum
HMGB1. Autoantibodies to HMGB1 in serum are found in healthy control
subjects as well as in patients with different diseases. HMGB1 also
binds to haptoglobin, a highly abundant plasma protein. This means
that antibodies used in immunoassays must compete with binding of
HMGB1 to endogenous serum HMGB1 autoantibodies and haptoglobin. To
overcome these potential problems, we developed and validated a specific
and sensitive assay based on stable isotope dilution and immunopurification
to quantify HMGB1 in plasma and serum using two-dimensional nano-ultra-high-performance
liquid chromatography parallel reaction monitoring/high-resolution
mass spectrometry. Using this assay, we found that serum HMGB1 in
24 healthy control subjects (6.0 ± 2.1 ng/mL) was above the mean
concentration reported for 18 different diseases (5.4 ± 2.8 ng/mL)
where the analyses were conducted with immunoassay methodology. In
light of our finding, the role of HMGB1 in these diseases will have
to be re-evaluated. The concentration of HMGB1 in citrated and EDTA-treated
plasma from the same healthy control subjects was below the limit
of detection of our assay (1 ng/mL), confirming that HMGB1 in serum
arises when blood is allowed to clot. This means that future studies
on the role of HMGB1 in vivo should be conducted on plasma rather
than serum.

==== Body
Amyloid β-peptides1 and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1),2 a non-histone chromosomal protein, are the two
most intensively studied endogenous cellular danger signals known
as danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules (Figure 1).3,4 DAMP
molecules, together with pathogen-associated molecular patterns, alert
the innate immune system by activating signal transduction pathways
through binding to pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRRs include
the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), Toll-like
receptors (TLRs), chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 3 (CXCR3), and
T-cell immunoglobulin mucin 3 (TIM3) (Figure 1).5−7 Binding to PRRs induces pro-inflammatory
cascades, which trigger the release of cytokines.8−11 PRRs are expressed by cells of
the innate immune system such as macrophages, leukocytes, and dendritic
cells (Figure 1).4,12,13 They are also expressed on the
surface of vascular cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells.14

Figure 1 Release of HMGB1 by blood cells, its activation of cell
surface
PRRs, and its involvement in immunological and inflammatory diseases.

In addition to its role in danger
signaling, nuclear HMGB1 binds
to the minor groove of nuclear DNA, bending the double helix and altering
chromatin structure to recruit transcription-regulating factors;15,16 whereas in the cytosol HMGB1 binds to beclin-2 and induces autophagy.7,17,18 HMGB1 is secreted from cells
in four different ways: passive release from necrotic cells;19 active secretion by inflammatory cells, such
as monocytes and macrophages;20−22 secretion from natural killer
cells to promote dendritic cell maturation during different immune
responses;23 and a less well-studied pathway
involving secretion from platelets.24

It has been suggested that the involvement of HMGB1 in chronic
inflammation serves to promote immunosuppression,14 and so it could play an important role in numerous and
diverse diseases (Figure 1). Substantial evidence for this role comes from the comparison
of serum HMGB1 levels in diseased individuals with serum HMGB1 levels
in healthy control subjects that were determined primarily by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based methodology (Table 1).25−43 Unfortunately, analysis of serum HMGB1 by ELISA poses some fundamental
challenges that call into question the results of many of the analyses
reported to date. First, autoantibodies to HMGB1 in serum have been
reported in healthy control subjects29,44 as well as
in serum from patients with different diseases.6,29,44−46 In fact, increased serum
HMGB1 autoantibody levels have even been proposed as a potential disease
biomarker for systemic lupus erthrythromatosus.44 Second, HMGB1 binds to haptoglobin, a highly abundant plasma
protein that is present at levels of 30–200 mg/dL.47 This means that antibodies used in ELISAs must
compete with binding to haptoglobin as well as fluctuating levels
of endogenous serum HMGB1 autoantibodies, which could result in finding
lower HMGB1 concentrations than are actually present. Third, the amino
acid sequences of HMGB1 and HMGB2 are 74% similar, so that there is
a high likelihood of cross-reactivity between HMGB1 and HMGB2 in ELISA
assays.48 Fourth, varying levels of post-translational
modification such as acetylation,49,50 methylation,51,52 and glycosylation53 could confound the
antibody–antigen interaction that ELISAs rely upon for accurate
quantification. As a further complication, anti-HMGB1 autoantibodies
from serum do not recognize neutrophil-derived HMGB1, although they
do recognize HMGB1 derived from lymphocytes.54

HMGB1 is a very unusual protein, which contains 30
consecutive
acidic aspartate and glutamate residues at its C-terminus (amino acids
186–215) together with 43 basic lysine residues spanning amino
acids 3–95 (Figure 2). Some 22 of the lysine residues have been reported as being
acetylated,49,50,55−57 and two have been reported as being methylated51,52 (Figure 2). In view
of the foregoing, there is a compelling need to develop a more specific
assay for the quantification of HMGB1 in serum and plasma. This would
facilitate more rigorous studies of the role that HMGB1 plays in the
inflammation- and immunologically mediated diseases shown in Figure 1. The assay would
require an internal standard that fully exchanges with endogenous
HMGB1 bound to any plasma or serum autoantibodies to correct for any
losses that might occur through noncovalent binding to the autoantibodies.
The assay would also need to differentiate HMGB1 from HMGB2, as well
as distinguishing HMGB1 from the vast array of potentially acetylated
forms (estimated at 100 000).56

acid sequence of HMGB1, showing the acidic tail in green
(residues 186–215) and the 43 basic lysine residues in red.
The 22 known sites of acetylation49,50,55−57 are shown in blue, and the two
known sites of methylation are shown in brown.51,52 A box = residues 9–79; B box = residues 88–162; nuclear
localization sequence 1 (NLS-1) = residues 28–44; NLS-2 = residues
179–185; the oxidized form has a disulfide between C23 and C45 (methionine is amino acid 1).2

We report a validated, sensitive,
and specific assay for plasma
and serum HMGB1 using two-dimensional nano-ultra-high-performance
liquid chromatography parallel reaction monitoring/high-resolution
mass spectrometry (2D-nano-UHPLC-PRM/HRMS). A [13C15N]-HMGB1 internal standard, prepared through stable isotope
labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), was used in combination
with initial immunopurification (IP) of the plasma or serum by use
of magnetic beads noncovalently bound to an HMGB1 polyclonal antibody
(pAb). Further purification was performed by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) coupled with in-gel acetylation
with [2H6]acetic anhydride to convert all acetylated
and nonacetylated HMGB1 proteins into a single molecular form. In-gel
Glu-C digestion was used to generate five peptides suitable for UHPLC/MS
analysis. The peptides contained 17 lysine residues, including the
eight (residues 28, 29, 30, 180, 182, 183, 184, and 185) that are
thought to undergo acetylation to prevent the nuclear localization
and facilitate secretion of HMGB1 (Figure 2, Table S1).49,50 By performing simultaneous PRM/full-scan HRMS analysis, it was also
possible to distinguish the Glu-C-derived endogenous acetylated or
methylated peptides from the corresponding [2H3]-acetylated peptides by their difference in mass.

Clinical Samples
Blood samples were obtained from healthy
human volunteers (12 males, 12 females, average age 50.0 years). They
are all enrolled in an ongoing mesothelioma biomarker study at the
University of Pennsylvania (IRB 800924).

Serum Preparation
Venous blood was drawn into 8.5 mL
red-cap Vacutainer tubes, which were kept at room temperature for
15–30 min to allow the blood to clot. The tubes were spun at
1500g for 5 min and the upper clear layer was carefully
transferred to two clean Eppendorf tubes, which were immediately frozen
at −80 °C after preparation until analysis.

Plasma Preparation
Venous blood from the same individuals
who provided serum samples was transferred to 8.5 mL sodium EDTA-coated
or sodium citrate-coated Vacutainer tubes. Blood (4 mL) was transferred
to 15 mL polypropylene tubes and spun at 200g for
13 min at room temperature with no brakes. The upper clear plasma
was carefully transferred to two clean 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, which
were spun at 800g for 5 min. The supernatant was
carefully transferred to another two clean 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes
that were immediately frozen at −80 °C until analysis.

Expression and Purification of Unlabeled and SILAC-Labeled HMGB1
The coding sequence of human HMGB1 was amplified by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) from the HMGB1 cDNA plasmid. The amplified HMGB1
fragment was cloned into a pRK5 plasmid and linked to the glutathione
S-transferase (GST) tag. After the construct was confirmed by DNA
sequencing, the plasmid was expanded in Escherichia
coli. The GST–HMGB1 pRK5 plasmid was then transfected
into human kidney HEK293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) by the use of lipofectamine
2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. SILAC-HMGB1 standard was expressed in transfected HEK293
cells that were cultured in DMEM/F12/SILAC medium containing 0.5 mM
[13C615N2]lysine and
0.2 mM [13C915N1]tyrosine
for at least three passages. Transfected cells were harvested in NP-40
lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5%
Triton X-100, 0.5% NP-40, and 1 mM DTT) containing protease inhibitor
cocktail after 24 h transfection. Cells were lysed by sonication on
ice for 20–30 pulses and the lysate was spun at 17200g for 15 min to remove any cell debris. The supernatant
was removed from the pellet and incubated with GSH Sepharose beads
at 4 °C overnight. After removal of the supernatant, the beads
were washed with the following solutions sequentially: IP lysis buffer
× 3, 0.5 M KCl in IP lysis buffer × 1, 1 M KCl in IP lysis
buffer × 1, and DPBS × 2. TEV enzyme was added to the beads,
together with TEV buffer and 1 mM DTT, to conduct the cleavage at
4 °C overnight. Released HMGB1 in the supernatant was collected
and its concentration was determined by measuring the absorption at
280 nm and using the extinction coefficient (λmax) = 21 430 M–1·cm–1 (predicted by the amino acid sequence).58 The concentration of the unlabeled standard was verified by comparing
HMGB1 bands with bands from known amounts of BSA in a Coomassie blue-stained
SDS–polyacrylamide electrophoretic gel and by amino acid analysis.
Concentration of the SILAC-labeled HMGB1 internal standard was determined
by comparing it with unlabeled HMGB standard bands and bovine serum
albumin (BSA) bands in a Coomassie blue-stained SDS–polyacrylamide
electrophoretic gel. The acetylated SILAC-HMGB1 standard was prepared
by treating SILAC-HMGB1 with excess acetic anhydride in 100 mM aqueous
NH4HCO3 at r.t. for 1 h.

Western Blot and Gel Staining
HMGB1 was detected by
an HMGB1 pAb (ab18256, Abcam) and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX). Western blots were developed
by use of electrochemical luminescence (ECL) reagents. Gels were stained
with colloidal Coomassie blue staining kit.

Immunopurification
Protein A/G magnetic beads were
washed twice with DPBS before use. Anti-HMGB1 rabbit pAb (100 μg)
or antiacetyl-lysine pAb (100 μg) was incubated with 10 mg of
protein A/G beads at 4 °C overnight. The pAb solution was removed
and the beads were washed with 1 mL of DPBS for 3 times before finally
being resuspended in 1 mL of DPBS to make the concentration of beads
10 mg/mL. This suspension was aliquoted into 20 clean protein LoBind
tubes with each containing 0.5 mg of magnetic beads. The DPBS was
removed and 250 μL of IP lysis buffer was added to each tube.
The same amount of SILAC-HMGB1 standard (13 ng) was added into each
sample (100 μL of serum or plasma) and incubated at room temperature
for 15 min. Each sample with SILAC-HMGB1 standard alone or with the
acetylated SILAC-HMGB1 standard was then added into the suspension
containing 0.5 mg of magnetic beads and 250 μL of IP lysis buffer
to carry out IP at 4 °C overnight.

In-Gel Acetylation with
[2H6]Acetic Anhydride
and Glu-C Digestion
After incubation with 0.5 mg of HMGB1
protein/magnetic beads at 4 °C overnight in protein LoBind tubes,
the supernatant was completely removed. Without any wash step, the
beads were resuspended in 20 μL of NuPAGE LDS sample buffer
(1×) containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol (BME). The beads in
the sample buffer were then heated to 95 °C for 10 min before
being loaded to 12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel. The gel was
run under 150 V for 1.5 h until the blue dye ran to the bottom of
the gel. Gels were stained with colloidal Coomassie blue staining
kit at room temperature overnight. After destaining with deionized
(DI) water for 30–60 min, the gel region between 25 and 37
kDa containing HMGB1 was cut out, sliced into 1 mm2 pieces
with a scalpel, and placed into a 1.5 mL protein LoBind tube. In-gel
acetylation follows the procedure described previously with minor
modification.59 Briefly, the gel pieces
were destained by adding 200 μL of 25 mM NH4HCO3 in water/acetonitrile (1:1 v/v) to the gel and shaking at
room temperature for 10 min. If blue staining was still visible in
the gel, 200 μL of 50 mM aqueous NH4HCO3 was added into the gel, which was shaken at room temperature for
10 min. The destaining step was then repeated. Acetonitrile (200 μL)
was added into the gel pieces to dehydrate the gel. The mixture was
shaken at room temperature for 5 min, the supernatant was removed,
and the dehydration step was repeated. A mixture of [2H6]acetic anhydride (5 μL) and 0.1 M aqueous NH4HCO3 (10 μL) was added to the gel pieces. The mixture
was gently mixed with a pipet tip with the lid open. Following the
addition of 50 μL of 0.1 M aqueous NH4HCO3, the pH of the mixture was adjusted to ∼8 (determined by
pH paper) with concentrated NH4OH. After incubation at
37 °C for 30–60 min, the supernatant was removed, and
the gel pieces were washed three times with water (200 μL).
The destaining and dehydration steps were repeated after the acetylation.
Gel pieces were then placed on ice, to which 2 μg of Glu-C (200
ng/μL in 50 mM ammonium acetate, pH 4) was added. The mixture
was incubated on ice until the solution was fully absorbed by the
dried gel pieces. Digestion buffer (60 μL of 50 mM ammonium
acetate, pH 4) was finally added to cover the gel pieces, and the
in-gel digestion was carried out by incubating the mixture at 37 °C
for 12–16 h. After the digestion, the supernatant was transferred
to a clean 1.5 mL protein LoBind tube, and 200 μL of extraction
buffer (3% formic acid in 50% aqueous acetonitrile) was added to the
gel pieces. The mixture was sonicated at 37 °C for 30 min. The
supernatant was combined and dried under N2. To the residue
was added 50 μL of water, and the solution was transferred to
deactivated glass inserts (Waters, Milford, MA).

Method Validation
Citrated human plasma was used for
preparation of calibration standards and quality controls (QCs). Calibration
standards were prepared by spiking appropriate amounts of HMGB1 standard
into the plasma (100 μL) to make final concentrations of 1,
2, 4, 8, 20, 40, and 80 ng/mL. The preparation procedures for QC samples
at concentrations of 1, 2.4, 32, and 60 ng/mL were the same as the
calibration standards. Assay validation was conducted according to
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance.60 The lowest QC sample (1.0 ng/mL) was defined as the lower
limit of quantification (LLOQ). The accuracy and precision were determined
on five replicates of LLOQ, low quality control (LQC), middle quality
control (MQC), and high quality control (HQC). QC samples (n = 5) were analyzed on the same day (intraday) and on three
separate days (interday, n = 15) as described below.

Stability Assessment of Reference Standard
The stock
solution of reference standard HMGB1 was analyzed on a weekly basis
by UV spectroscopy to ensure that there was no degradation. In addition,
calibration curves together with the four QC samples (n = 5) were analyzed on two additional days. On each day, calibration
solutions were freshly diluted from the same reference standard solution.
QC samples were thawed from frozen solutions that were originally
prepared and stored in matrix (pooled human plasma).

2D-Nano-UHPLC-PRM/HRMS
Mass spectrometry was conducted
on a Q Exactive HF hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled
to a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano with capillary flowmeter chromatographic
system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). The 2D system was
composed of two columns, including a trapping column (Acclaim PepMap
C18 cartridge (0.3 mm × 5 mm, 100 Å, Thermo Scientific)
for preconcentration purpose and an analytical column (C18 AQ nano-LC column with a 10 μm pulled tip (75 μm ×
25 cm, 3 μm particle size; Columntip, New Haven, CT) to separate
digested peptides; two pumps, including one nanopump delivering solvents
to analytical column and a micropump connecting to the trapping column;
and a 10-port valve. The 2D-nano-LC system was controlled by Xcalibur
software from the Q-Exactive mass spectrometer.

Samples (usually
8 μL) were injected via microliter-pickup injection mode. Loading
solvent was water/acetonitrile (99.7:0.3 v/v) containing 0.2% formic
acid. A 10-port valve was set at the loading position (1–2)
with the loading solvent at 10 μL/min for 3 min. The valve was
then changed to the analysis position (1–10), at which time
the trapping column was connected with the analytical column, and
samples loaded on the loading column were back-flushed into the analytical
column. The valve was maintained in the analysis position for 10 min
before the end of the run, when it was switched to the loading position
ready for the next analysis. Samples were eluted with a linear gradient
at a flow rate of 0.4 μL/min: 2% B at 2 min, 5% B at 15 min,
35% B at 40 min, 95% B at 45–55 min, 2% B at 58–70 min.
Solvent A was water/acetonitrile (99.5:0.5 v/v) containing 0.1% formic
acid, and solvent B was acetonitrile/water (98:2 v/v) containing 0.1%
formic acid. Nanospray Flex ion source (Thermo Scientific) was used.
MS operating conditions were as follows: spray voltage 2500 V, ion
transfer capillary temperature 250 °C, ion polarity positive,
S-lens RF level 55, in-source collision-induced dissociation (CID)
1.0 eV. Both full-scan and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) were
used. The full-scan parameters were resolution 60 000, automatic
gain control (AGC) target 1 × 106, maximum IT 200
ms, scan range m/z 200–1200.
The PRM parameters were resolution 60 000, AGC target 2 ×
105, maximum IT 80 ms, loop count 5, isolation window 1.0
Da, NCE 25. The PRM was scheduled for 28.5–31.5 min for acetylated
E26HKKKHPDASVNFSE40, 28.5–31.5 min for
acetylated K57GKFE61, 30.0–33.0 min for
acetylated K146KAAKLKE153, and 26.0–29.0
min for acetylated K180SKKKKE186.

Data Analysis
Data analysis was performed by use of
Skyline (MacCoss Laboratory, University of Washington, Seattle, WA).60 After selection of the proper transitions, the
peak area ratio of each unlabeled/light (L) peptide to SILAC-labeled/heavy
(H) peptide pair was calculated by the Skyline software and exported
for absolute quantification. The amount defined by each peptide was
calculated by averaging L/H ratios of the three PRM transitions. HMGB1
levels were calculated from the average of the four selected quantifying
peptides. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism (v5.01,
GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA).

Results and Discussion
Preparation
of HMGB1 Protein Standard and SILAC-Labeled Internal
Standards
Both the endogenous and SILAC-labeled proteins
were expressed in HEK293 cells with a short linker containing a recognition
site of TEV enzyme and a GST tag at the amino-terminus for purification.
After the GST-HMGB1 conjugate was bound to the GSH Sepharose beads,
the GST tag was cleaved by TEV to release HMGB1. Glu-C digestion of
SILAC-labeled HMGB1 revealed >99.9% {heavy/(light + heavy)} labeling
efficiency based on the PRM transitions for the four peptides (Table S1). The acetylated HMGB1 SILAC standard
was prepared by adding acetic anhydride to the SILAC standard in 100
mM NH4HCO3 buffer (pH ≈ 8). Glu-C digestion
and UPLC-HRMS analysis indicated complete and nonselective acetylation
on all the lysines analyzed (data not shown).

Selection of HMGB1 Peptides
and Parallel Reaction Monitoring
Transitions
To enable the detection of NLS-1 and NLS-2 peptides
and the interrogation of acetylation on lysine residues, we chose
to utilize Glu-C as the endoproteinase. The expressed and purified
HMGB1 and SILAC-HMGB1 standards were acetylated and then digested
in solution by Glu-C. The proteolytic peptides were analyzed in both
full-scan and PRM modes. The identity of digested peptides was verified
by searching the BLAST database in Skyline.61 Five potentially useful acetylated peptides were selected (Table S1), and their precursor and all product
ions were assessed for signal intensity in the PRM/MS mode. Acetylated
decapeptide A170AKKGVVKAE179 exhibited fluctuating
signals among samples, especially at lower levels, and so it was excluded
for quantification purposes. NLS-1 was always observed as two peptides,
one with one missed cleavage (E26HKKKHPDASVNFSE40) and the fully cleaved form (H27KKKHPDASVNFSE40), even at different protein/protease ratios. We chose the form with
one missed cleavage for quantification due to its slightly higher
intensity. Although precursor ions always exhibited 5–20-fold
higher intensities than their corresponding product ions, they always
had interfering signals or were even not detected due to the high
interfering background signals. In contrast, product ions were more
specific as less interfering signals were present in the channel.
For the NLS-1 and NLS-2 peptides, the three most intense product ions
were used for PRM of both the endogenous HMGB1 (Table S1) and SILAC-labeled internal standard (Table S1). Due to its short length, K57GKFE61 pentapeptide only generated one product ion with
good and consistent intensity (Table S1).

Sample Processing and Immunopurification of HMGB1
The
low abundance of endogenous HMGB1 in the serum and plasma necessitated
an immunopurification (IP) step before digestion and analysis. Western
blot analyses were conducted in order to determine the best pAb to
employ for IP of the serum prior to MS analysis. The amount of pAb
and magnetic beads (0.5 mg) were identical for each of the Western
blot analyses shown in Figure S1. Lanes
7 and 8 exhibited the most intense bands corresponding to HMGB1, which
showed that the pAb used (Sigma H9539) had the highest affinity toward
HMGB1 (when bound to magnetic beads) among the four different antibodies
that were analyzed (Figure S1). Therefore,
the Sigma H9539 pAb was used for all IP procedures. HMGB1 is known
to noncovalently bind to HMGB1 autoantibodies in serum and plasma.
Therefore, the HMGB1-SILAC standard was allowed to equilibrate with
HMGB1 bound to autoantibodies and haptoglobin in serum and plasma
before IP was conducted. Western blot analysis revealed >80% recovery
of HMGB1 after IP even in the presence of serum (Figure S1). However, Coomassie blue staining showed a substantial
number of additional proteins were captured by the pAb. In the attempt
to remove these nonspecifically bound proteins, we included a wash
step with DPBS or used pAbs covalently linked to magnetic beads followed
by the stringent washing of the beads, as we reported recently for
platelet frataxin protein.62 Unfortunately,
>50% of the HMGB1 was eluted by the first DPBS wash and >80%
eluted
off after three DPBS washes (Figure S2).
In addition, covalently linking HMGB1 pAbs to the beads almost completely
removed their binding capacity (data not shown). Therefore, SDS–PAGE
was used to remove nonspecific bound proteins (Figure 3). Light and heavy chains that arose from
the pAb were also removed in this step, reducing any potential suppression
of ionization in the mass spectrometer.

processing procedure.

The possibility that plasma and serum HMGB1 could be acetylated
posed a challenge for the quantification because the endogenous acetylated
HMGB1 peptides would have different retention times and different
masses from SILAC-HMGB1-derived peptides. To prevent this potential
problem, an in-gel acetylation step was introduced to convert HMGB1
and SILAC-HMGB1 to the same molecular forms. Acetylation was conducted
with [2H6]acetic anhydride in order to differentiate
the in-gel chemical acetylation from the endogenous post-translational
acetylation (Figure 3). Endoproteinase Glu-C was then used to conduct in-gel protease
digestion (Figure 3). UPLC-HRMS analysis revealed that the acetylation was quantitative
and that the acetylation reaction was nonselective (data not shown).

Method Validation by Use of IP-UHPLC-PRM/HRMS and SILAC-Labeled
HMGB1
Human citrated plasma was selected as the matrix for
method validation because the test experiment results indicated that
the endogenous HMGB1 level in human citrated plasma was under the
limit of detection of our method. Calibration curves were constructed
at seven different concentrations ranging from 1 to 80 ng/mL with
human citrated plasma (100 μL) as the matrix. Citrated plasma
pooled from 10 healthy control subjects was used to minimize preanalytical
variability. Linear standard curves were obtained for each of the
four peptides, with r2 values between
0.9854 and 0.9959 (Figure S3A–D).
Furthermore, similar values were found when mean area ratios of analyte
to internal standard for the four peptides were plotted against HMGB1
concentrations (Figure S3E). The LLOQ was
set at 1 ng/mL, which is below the mean concentration reported in
20 different studies of serum from healthy control subjects and serum
from diseased individuals (Table 1). Accuracy and precision for the LLOQ were well within
the limits of acceptance: intraday (n = 5), precision
12.8%, accuracy 91.9% (Table S2). Therefore,
this LLOQ readily met the criteria required by the FDA of precision
better than 20% and accuracy of between 80% and 120%.

Additional
validation was performed with quality control (QC) samples at three
different concentrations according to FDA guidance63 including low (LQC, 2.4 ng/mL), middle (MQC, 32 ng/mL),
and high (HQC, 60 ng/mL) QC samples prepared in human citrated plasma.
Precision for intraday (n = 5) QC analysis was 2.1–5.3%
and accuracy was 87.6–96.6% (Table S2A). Precision for interday (n = 15) QC analysis was
4.8–7.8% and accuracy was 100.0%-108.6.% (Table S2B). Freeze–thawing through three cycles of
the LQC (n = 5), MQC (n = 5), and
HQC (n = 5) plasma samples did not affect the precision
and accuracy (data not shown).

HMGB1 Levels in Plasma
and Serum from Healthy Control Subjects
Endogenous HMGB1
levels were quantified in several human matrices
from 24 healthy control subjects to evaluate the utility of this IP
2D-nano-UHPLC-PRM/MS method. Typical chromatograms for endogenous
HMGB1 and SILAC standard in citrated plasma and in serum are shown
in Figure 4 panels
A and B, respectively.

eight of the important acetylation sites.49,50 (A) Citrated plasma sample. (B) Serum sample with a determined HMGB1
concentration of 4.7 ng/mL. K* = [13C615N2]lysine, Ac* = C[2H3]CO.

No acetylated peptides were detected
when relevant ions were reconstructed
for individual endogenous acetylated peptides under full-scan mode
(Figures S4 and S5). This is consistent
with previous studies because acetylated HMGB1 has never been detected
in serum from healthy control subjects. However, it is conceivable
that the HMGB1 pAb did not fully recognize the acetylated HMGB1. Therefore,
additional proof of the lack of endogenous lysine acetylation in serum
HMGB1 from healthy control individuals was obtained by repeating the
assay with anti-acetyllysine pAb bound to the magnetic beads together
with the HMGB1 mAb magnetic beads. No additional HMGB1 was detected
even though an acetylated HMGB1 SILAC standard was recovered in excellent
yield (Figures S4 and S5).

Five healthy
control serum samples were randomly selected for repeat
analysis. The percent deviation from the mean (Mean Dev %) of the
first analysis and repeat analysis ranged from +2.7% to −8.0%
(Table S3). The mean value for the five
repeat samples of 6.4 ng/mL was −2.4% of the mean for the five
samples analyzed originally (6.6 ng/mL) and not significantly different
(p = 0.313). This confirms that the repeat analyses
were well within the guidance of 30% suggested by the FDA for repeat
samples.

Conclusion
Serum HMGB1 has been
reported to be a biomarker for a variety of
diseases (Table 1).25−43 Most of these previous studies quantified HMGB1 by ELISA, which
is problematic due to the presence of HMGB1 autoantibodies in serum
and the ability of haptoglobin to bind HMGB1. This led us to develop
a more specific stable isotope dilution IP 2D-nano-UHPLC-PRM/MS method.
A SILAC-labeled standard was used to account for any losses during
IP, gel purification, and in-gel digestion. The requirement for stable
isotopically labeled protein internal standards to improve precision
of protein analysis stimulated the development of methodology based
on that used for NMR spectroscopy.64 At
the same time, the concept of SILAC was developed, in which labeling
was conducted in experimental cells and endogenous proteins were derived
from control cells in culture.65 However,
cells can grow more slowly when stable isotopically labeled amino
acids are substituted for endogenous amino acids, leading to differential
protein expression. In addition, conventional SILAC methodology cannot
be used for analysis of proteins in tissues and biofluids. This stimulated
new strategies termed stable isotope labeled proteome (SILAP) standard
and absolute SILAC, which were introduced in 200566 and 2008,67 respectively, to
circumvent these problems. SILAC-labeled recombinant proteins produced
in vitro or in vivo are used as internal standards, which are directly
mixed into lysates of cells or tissues,67−69 or appropriate biofluids
such as cervicovaginal fluid,70 serum,71,72 and platelet lysates.62 We have shown
previously for the analysis of drugs,73 DNA adducts,74 coenzymes,75 lipids,76 peptides,77 and proteins62,72 that it is
not necessary to determine exactly how much internal standard is being
added to the biofluid. However, it is very important to add exactly
the same amount of internal standard to the biofluid standards, QCs,
and study samples. It is also extremely important to have an accurate
determination of the amount of endogenous analyte used in the standard
curves. Therefore, the HMGB1 standard was carefully purified and quantified
by PAGE with Coomassie staining and UV and amino acid analysis. We
also rigorously determined that there were no post-translational modifications
on the endogenous HMGB1 protein that we expressed.

Chemically
acetylating all unmodified lysines simplified the 100 000
possible modified forms of HMGB150 to one
fully acetylated molecular form (Figure 3). Concomitant full-scan MS1 data generated
during PRM analysis were used to show that endogenous acetylation
had not occurred on 17 of the potential acetylation sites on HMGB1
(Figures S4 and S5), including the eight
present on NLS-1 and NLS-2 that are thought to be critical for HMGB1
secretion (Figure 2).49,50 If necessary, the specific endogenous acetylation
sites could have been identified by LC/MS/MS analysis. The mean serum
HMGB1 level reported in 18 studies of healthy control subjects was
1.9 ± 0.9 ng/mL, and serum HMGB1 from 18 different diseases was
5.4 ± 2.8 ng/mL (Figure 5). In contrast, the mean serum HMGB1 concentration found in
24 healthy control subjects determined by stable isotope dilution
IP 2D-nano-UHPLC-PRM/MS was 6.0 ± 2.1 ng/mL. Furthermore, HMGB1
levels remained unchanged when anti-acetyllysine pAb was used in addition
to the HMGB1 pAb, demonstrating that endogenous HMGB1 was not acetylated
in serum from healthy control subjects. In contrast to serum, citrated
and EDTA-treated plasma had HMGB1 concentrations of <1 ng/mL in
the same individuals (Figure 5), which confirmed that HMGB1 is released when blood is allowed
to clot. It is noteworthy that an ELISA assay also showed that plasma
HMGB1 concentrations were lower than those in serum.78 In light of these findings, 18 of the previous studies
of serum HMGB1 in immune, inflammatory, and cardiovascular diseases
and cancer will have to be re-evaluated (Table 1). Until the HMGB1 concentrations in these
diseases have been rigorously established, the role of HMGB1 should
be considered questionable. Two studies (alcoholic liver disease and
peritoneal mesothelioma) have reported serum HMGB1 concentrations
significantly higher (18 and 27 ng/mL, Table 1) than the healthy control serum concentrations
determined by UHPLC-HRMS (Table 1). This indicates that HMGB1 could be upregulated in
these diseases. However, the concentrations of serum HMGB1 concentrations
reported in the alcoholic liver disease (ALD) study for healthy control
subjects of 1.1 ng/mL were significantly lower than the concentrations
determined by UPLC-HRMS (6.0 ng/mL, Figure 5). This suggests that there could be a problem
with the assay that was used in the alcoholic liver disease study
and that circulating HMGB1 concentrations in this disease should also
be re-evaluated. Our study has provided clear evidence that HMGB1
is released during the clotting process (Figure 5). Furthermore, it is known that platelets
release HMGB1 when they aggregate.79 This
situation is reminiscent of serum thromboxane B2 analysis,
where ex vivo platelet activation is used to assess the capacity for
cyclooxygase 1-mediated thromboxane production.80 There has been substantial interest in the analysis of
serum HMGB1 for monitoring systemic HMGB1 production in numerous diseases
(Table 1). A review
of citations in PubMed revealed that over the last 15 years, there
have been 897 published studies on the analysis of serum HMGB1, with
a 28-fold increase from four in 2002 to 113 in 2017. Our study has
clearly shown that serum HMGB1 is not a biomarker of systemic disease,
and so all of the previous studies reporting serum HMGB1 levels will
have to be re-evaluated by use of citrated or EDTA-treated plasma
instead of serum.

Figure 5 HMGB1 levels in citrated plasma (<1.0 ng/mL, n = 24), EDTA-treated plasma (<1.0 ng/mL, n =
24), and serum (mean = 6.0 ± 2.1 ng/mL, n =
24) from healthy control subjects, determined by stable isotope dilution
IP 2D-nano-UHPLC-PRM/MS, and reported levels of serum HMGB1 determined
by ELISA in healthy control subjects (mean = 2.1 ± 0.9 ng/mL)
and cases (mean = 5.4 ± 2.8 ng/mL) for 18 of the studies shown
in Table 1 (indicated
with asterisks). Control plasma and serum samples from healthy subjects
for the LC/MS analyses were obtained from the same individuals. Data
are shown as means ± stndard deviation (SD).
