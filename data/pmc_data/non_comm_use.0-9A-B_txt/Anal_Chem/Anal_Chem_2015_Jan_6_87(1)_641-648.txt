Recent studies have demonstrated
that various DNA adducts can be
detected in human tissues and fluids using liquid chromatography connected
to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). However, the utility of a
single DNA adduct as a biomarker in risk assessment is debatable because
humans are exposed to many genotoxicants. We established a method
to measure DNA adducts derived from 16 ubiquitous genotoxicants and
developed an analytical technique for their simultaneous quantification
by ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-MS/MS. Methods for
the enrichment of the analytes from DNA hydrolysates and chromatographic
separation preceding mass spectrometric analysis were optimized, and
the resultant technique was used for the simultaneous analysis of
the 16 DNA adducts in human lung biopsy specimens. Eleven adducts
(formed by benzo[a]pyrene, 1-methylpyrene, 4-aminobiphenyl,
2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine,
1-methoxy-3-indolylmethylglucosinolate, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and
malondialdehyde) were not detected in any tissue sample (limits of
detection: 0.02–7.1 adducts/108 nucleosides). 3,N4-etheno-2′-deoxycytidine and 1,N6-etheno-2′-deoxyadenosine, formed from
2,3-epoxyaldehydes of endogenous lipid peroxidation products, were
present in all subjects (16.9–115.3 and 27.2–179/108 nucleosides, respectively). The same was true for N2-(trans-methylisoeugenol-3′-yl)-2′-deoxyguanosine,
the major adduct of methyleugenol (1.7–23.7/108 nucleosides).
A minor adduct of methyleugenol and two adducts of furfuryl alcohol
were detected in several pulmonary specimens. Taken together, we developed
a targeted approach for the simultaneous mass spectrometric analyses
of 16 DNA adducts, which can be easily extended by adducts formed
from other mutagens. The method allowed one to detect adducts of furfuryl
alcohol and methyleugenol in samples of human lung.

adducts are a major cause of mutations which can lead to the development
of tumors. The measurement of DNA adducts is an estimate of the exposure
and the biologically effective dose and accounts for interindividual
differences in absorption, metabolic activation, or detoxification
and DNA repair. Thus, DNA adducts are excellent biomarkers of internal
exposure to reactive metabolites and may be correlated to tumor incidences.1−3 The research on DNA adduct analysis was greatly advanced by the 32P-postlabeling method,4 one of
the first techniques that provided sufficient sensitivity for the
quantification of DNA adducts in human tissue samples.5−8 However, identification of the adduct remains tentative with this
method, as it mainly relies on chromatographic properties of the lesion.
In the last two decades, a number of techniques based on liquid chromatography
combined with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for DNA adduct quantification
have been developed, which surpass many other analytical methods especially
regarding specificity of detection.9−12 However, reports on determination
of DNA adducts in human samples by LC-MS/MS-based techniques are relatively
few. Some examples reported in the literature are the detection of
DNA adducts of 4-aminobiphenyl in pancreas tissue from smokers,13 of acrolein14 or
acetaldehyde15 in leukocytes from smokers,
of estrogen adducts in breast tumor tissue,16 and of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine
(PhIP) and 4-aminobiphenyl adducts in saliva samples.17 The 2′-deoxyguanosine (dG) adduct of PhIP (C8-PhIP-dG, C8-(2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine-N2-yl)-2′-deoxyguanosine)
was detected in the normal tumor-adjacent tissue of just one of 70
breast cancer patients at a level of 3 molecules C8-PhIP-dG/109 nucleotides.18 Recently, Yun et al. reported on the quantitation of adducts from
aristolochic acid in paraffin-embedded kidney samples from patients
of Balkan endemic nephropathy.19

The focus of many of these studies was on the quantification of
DNA adducts formed from a single genotoxicant, which restricts their
applicability to molecular epidemiology studies seeking to address
the role of complex chemical exposures in cancer risk. Here, a technique
is in demand that allows monitoring of an individual’s internal
exposure to an array of electrophilic DNA-reactive metabolites. This
so-called adductome defined by measurement of multiple DNA adducts
derived from common environmental and food genotoxicants may be a
suitable parameter for the correlation of DNA damage with tumor incidence
in epidemiological studies. A high resolution MSn technology
with impressive specificity was used for the simultaneous detection
of 18 adducts in hepatic DNA of mice treated with the tobacco carcinogen
4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and is an excellent
starting point for the analyses of DNA adducts in humans.20 Chou et al. used multiple reaction monitoring
(MRM) for the parallel detection of 11 oxidative stress-related DNA
adducts in various human autopsy samples.21

However, the specific analysis of multiple DNA adducts is
still
in its early stages. There are various analytical challenges with
the adductome approach, three of which are technical problems: First,
the sensitivities of some LC-MS/MS methods for measurements of DNA
adducts are variable and low, when compared to those of 32P-postlabeling.9 Second, the conditions
of enzymatic hydrolysis and the techniques of DNA adduct enrichment
preceding LC-MS/MS quantification vary considerably. For example,
DNA adduct enrichment may involve extraction with 1-butanol,22 solid-phase extraction (SPE) using different
types of reversed-phase-resins,23,24 precipitation of the
hydrolytic enzymes from the digestion mixture with methanol21 or ethanol,25 and
online column-switching chromatography.18,26 Third, a reliable
quantification of DNA adducts requires isotope-labeled internal standards
for each adduct, which can pose a substantial effort in chemical synthesis.

Here, we describe a targeted approach that allows for the quantification
of 16 DNA adducts derived from exposure to food and environmental
mutagens and carcinogens, as well as from endogenous electrophiles
produced from common lipid peroxidation-related degradation products.
The molecular structures of the DNA adducts are depicted in Figure
S-1 of the Supporting Information. We developed
a standardized method for a combined adduct enrichment following enzymatic
hydrolysis of the DNA and optimized ultra performance liquid chromatography
(UPLC) of the adducts for quantification by mass spectrometric MRM
employing the stable isotopic dilution method. Our analytical approach
was applied to the measurement of this array of DNA adducts in ten
human lung samples.

Human Lung Samples
Pulmonary tissue samples, from four
male and six female lung tumor patients, were provided by Biopredic
International (Rennes, France). Immediately after surgical intervention,
the samples of nontumorous tissues were stored at −80 °C
until they were homogenized for DNA isolation. Table S-1 of the Supporting Information provides an overview of
the patients’ sex and age. The study was approved by the ethics
committee of the University of Potsdam (Germany).

DNA Isolation
Pulmonary DNA was isolated using a Qiagen
kit for the preparation of genomic DNA with slight modifications of
the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands).
Briefly, 100 mg samples of frozen tissues were homogenized in 9.5
mL of the lysis buffer G2. The homogenate was digested with proteinase
K (500 μL, 10 mg/mL) and DNase-free RNase A (20 μL, 10
mg/mL in water) for 2 h at 37 °C. The mixture was cooled to 4
°C and centrifuged at 10 000g for 10
min. The supernatant was loaded onto a Qiagen Genomic-tip 100/G previously
equilibrated with 4 mL of QBT-buffer. The column was washed twice
with a 7.5 mL QC solution. The DNA was eluted with 5 mL of QF solution
that was heated to 70 °C, precipitated by adding 2.5 mL of 2-propanol
and separated by centrifugation at 15 000g for 15 min. The pellet was washed with 1 mL of cold 70% ethanol,
centrifuged again and dissolved in 300 μL of water. The DNA
concentration was determined spectrophotometrically with a Nanodrop
ND-1000 spectrometer (peqlab Biotechnologie, Erlangen, Germany).

Enzymatic Digestion of DNA
Samples containing 350 μg
of DNA were dried together with fixed amounts of the isotope-labeled
adduct standards in the range of 58.3 fmol (N6-MIE-dA) to 5413 fmol (C8-PhIP-dG). The conditions
were adopted from optimization studies using DNA containing adducts
of methyleugenol and of 1MIM glucosinolate (neoglucobrassicin).32 The efficacy of the digestion was tested via
UPLC-MS/MS quantification of dG. Small portions of 6.85 μL of
the digests were diluted with 130.1 μL of water containing 373
μmol of [15N5]dG. The concentration of
dG in the digests was determined via the MRM peak area ratio of dG
(m/z = 268.1 → 152.1) and
[15N5]dG (m/z = 273.1 → 157.1). The average concentration of dG in the
digests of the 20 pulmonary DNA samples was 505 μM, which corresponds
to a dG content of 21.6% in the DNA samples. The actual dG content
in the human genome is 20.5%.

DNA Adduct Enrichment
Four different techniques for
the extraction of multiple adducts from DNA hydrolysates were tested.
The extraction methods are described briefly. Chou et al. described
the precipitation of the digestion enzymes with methanol.21 A DNA digest (∼440 μL) was concentrated
under reduced pressure to a volume of 100 μL and diluted with
300 μL of methanol. The mixture was centrifuged, and the pellet
was extracted with another 300 μL of methanol. The combined
methanol fractions were evaporated to dryness. Further, we tested
the efficacy of extraction with 1-butanol.22,28 The DNA digests (∼440 μL) were diluted with 560 μL
of water, and 84 mg of (NH4)2SO4 was
added. The samples were extracted three times with 1 mL of water-saturated
1-butanol. The combined 1-butanol phases were washed with 500 μL
of water saturated with 1-butanol and evaporated to dryness. The application
of Oasis columns (3 cm3, 60 mg) from Waters (Eschborn,
Germany) was described.23 The columns were
preconditioned with 3 mL of methanol and 3 mL of water. The DNA digestion
mixtures (∼440 μL) were diluted by addition of 160 μL
of water and 160 μL of methanol, vortexed thoroughly and centrifuged
at 15 000g for 15 min. The supernatants were
loaded onto the columns and washed with 3 mL of water/methanol (95:5).
DNA adducts were eluted with 3 mL of methanol, and the solvents were
evaporated. The other SPE method was based on Chromabond C18 columns
(500 mg) from Macherey & Nagel (Düren, Germany). The DNA
digests were diluted with 700 μL of water, thoroughly vortexed,
and centrifuged at 15 000g for 15 min. The
columns were prepared with 2 mL of methanol and 2 mL of water. The
samples were loaded, and the columns were washed with 1 mL of water.
DNA adducts were eluted with 1.5 mL of methanol, and the solvent was
evaporated. For UPLC-MS/MS analyses, all samples were dissolved in
25 μL of 75% methanol.

For the recovery assessment of
each extraction method, ten samples of 350 μg of herring sperm
DNA were prepared, five of which were spiked with defined amounts
of all isotope-labeled standards. Following enzymatic hydrolysis,
the DNA adduct reference compounds were extracted and analyzed by
UPLC-MS/MS. The mean peak areas A̅1 of the quantifier signals were determined. (The quantifier signals
of the DNA adducts are indicated in Table S-2, Supporting Information.) The other five DNA samples were first
subjected to the workup procedure, and the residuals were then spiked
with defined amounts of all isotope-labeled standards. The mean peak
areas of the quantifiers of the reference compounds (A̅2) were determined. The recovery value RM,Ad for the processing of a specific DNA adduct (Ad)
by one of the extraction methods (M) was calculated as RM,Ad = A̅1/A̅2 × 100%.

The second parameter with a strong
impact on the overall performances
of the DNA adduct analyses is the ion suppression of MRM signals that
is caused by residuals from DNA digestion and workup solvents (matrix
effect). In order to determine the effect of the ion suppression,
five samples of commercial herring sperm DNA were subjected to digestion
and extraction, and the residuals were spiked with defined amounts
of the isotope-labeled reference compounds. These were analyzed by
UPLC-MS/MS, and the mean peak areas of the quantifier traces (A̅3) were compared with those resulting
from direct injection of the reference substances (A̅4). The relative signal intensity was calculated (ISM,Ad = A̅3/A̅4 × 100%). The overall performance PM,Ad (%) was calculated from PM,Ad = RM,Ad × ISM,Ad/100%.

UPLC-MS/MS Analyses
Mixtures of DNA adducts were separated
using an Acquity UPLC System (Waters) with a HSS T3 column (1.8 μm,
2.1 × 100 mm, Waters). Samples of 8 μL were injected. The
chromatographic efficiencies of two eluent solvent systems were studied.
The first eluent system consisted of water (solvent A) and acetonitrile
(solvent B). Both solvents were acidified with 0.25% acetic acid and
0.25% formic acid. Following a washing interval of 1 min at 100% solvent
A, an 11 min gradient was applied with decreases of solvent A from
100% to 70% solvent A (1 to 8 min) and then to 30% A (8 to 12 min)
at a 0.35 mL/min flow rate. The second eluent system consisted of
10 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0, (A) and methanol (B). It
was applied using a linear 11 min gradient from 90% solvent A to 30%
solvent A (1 to 12 min) at a 0.35 mL/min flow rate.33 The UPLC was connected to a Quattro Premier XE, a linear
tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters) with an electrospray
interface operated in the positive ion mode. MRM was used to record
74 transitions, half of which served the detection of the analyte
DNA adducts while the other half was employed to monitor the isotope-labeled
internal standard reference substances. The fragmentation transitions
are summarized in Table S-2 (Supporting Information) together with the transition-specific cone voltages and collision
energies. Other mass spectrometric parameters were constant: temperature
of the electrospray source, 110 °C; desolvation temperature,
450 °C; desolvation gas, nitrogen (850 L/h); cone gas, nitrogen
(50 L/h); collision gas, argon (indicated cell pressure, ∼5
× 10–3 mbar). The dwell time was set to 50
ms, and capillary voltage was set to 1.0 kV. The RF1 lens voltage
was 0.1 V.

Limits of Detection (LODs)
The LOD
values were estimated
from the background integrals of the quantifier-traces in 1-butanol
extracted residuals of digests of 350 μg of herring sperm DNA.
The LOD of a particular DNA adduct A was defined by LODA = X̅A + 3σA,
with X̅A as the analyte concentration
corresponding to the mean area of five measurements of the background
signal and with σA as the standard deviation. The
retention time and the peak width of the adduct signal were determined
from the coeluting isotope-labeled reference compounds. Herring sperm
DNA contained some of the adducts analyzed in this study. In particular,
3,N4-εdC, 1,N6-εdA, and both 2-methylfuranyl adducts27 were present at considerable levels and 5-methylfurfuryl
adducts23 were present at moderate levels.
Therefore, the LODs for nucleoside adducts of furfuryl alcohol and
5-hydroxymethylfurfural were determined with 350 μg of porcine
liver DNA prepared in our laboratory, in which these adducts were
below the LOD. An LOD was not determined for 3,N4-εdC and 1,N6-εdA,
because each of these adducts was clearly detectable in all of the
human lung samples.

Results and Discussion
Enrichment of Adducts from
DNA Hydrolysates
A critical
step preceding mass spectrometric DNA adduct analyses is the analyte
extraction from DNA digestion mixtures. This is particularly challenging
if multiple DNA adducts with differing polarity are involved. The
authors of most reports on the quantification of multiple DNA adducts
focused on different classes of adducts, for example, either hydrophobic
“bulky adducts” derived from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons34 or hydrophilic adducts formed as a consequence
of oxidative stress and internal exposure to degradation products
of lipid peroxidation.35 We sought to develop
an analytical tool for the simultaneous quantification of many DNA
adducts with diverse chemical structures without losing the sensitivities
of single adduct analyses. For this purpose, stable isotope-labeled
internal reference substances of 16 DNA adducts were obtained (Figure
S-1, Supporting Information). These DNA
adducts originate from electrophilic metabolites of compounds obtained
from different sources, such as food plants, environmental contamination,
lipid peroxidation, or cooked meat. Molecular structures and properties
of the adducts differed markedly suiting our goal to develop a versatile
method for the quantification of multiple DNA adducts that may be
easily extended to the quantification of other adducts in the future.

We explored four different methods of adduct extraction frequently
used prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. The overall performance of these
techniques is based on two parameters: the recovery of single DNA
adducts and the loss of signal intensity caused by ion suppression.
The parameters designated in the following with RM,Ad (recovery) and with ISM,Ad (ion suppression)
were determined in independent experiments for all adduct standards
(Ad) with each of the workup methods (M). Table S-3 in the Supporting Information summarizes the recovery
values RM,Ad. The enrichment with methanol,
1-butanol, C18 columns, and Oasis columns yielded reasonable recoveries
over 50% for 13, 10, 12, and 12 out of 16 adducts, respectively. The
peak area from the analysis of a specific DNA adduct also may be reduced
by ion suppression that is caused by competing ionization of constituents
of DNA or of the solvents employed for sample workup. The parameter
ISM,Ad was defined as the ratio from the peak areas of
the quantifier signal of a DNA adduct standard (Ad) that was analyzed
either together with the residual of a specific workup method (M)
or by direct injection (=100%). The mass spectrometric detection was
least affected by previous extraction of the DNA adducts via 1-butanol
or the Oasis columns (Table S-4, Supporting Information).

The recovery of the extraction (Table S-3, Supporting Information) and the ion suppression of the MS/MS
detection (Table S-4, Supporting Information) were used to determine the overall performance of the workup methods
for each of the DNA adducts included in this study (Table 1). Most of the DNA adducts were analyzed with satisfactory
performances using either Oasis columns or the liquid–liquid
extraction with 1-butanol as an inexpensive but effective alternative.
The data in Table 1 indicate that some DNA
adducts were difficult to enrich by any of the methods, i.e., N6-MF-dA and N6-MP-dA.
This is primarily due to the poor recovery (Table S-3, Supporting Information) and has been observed
previously.27,29 It is of note that the enrichment
routines using SPE columns were detrimental to the quantification
of C8-PhIP-dG. Goodenough et al. previously observed
this phenomenon and showed that ion suppression effects were caused
by contaminants in the solvents and SPE columns.36 Considering the collected data, the liquid–liquid
extraction method using 1-butanol and the SPE with Oasis columns yielded
the best results. We favored the liquid–liquid extraction because
it provides a satisfactory recovery of C8-PhIP-dG.

a The performance PM,Ad is the residual peak area of the quantifier

of a particular DNA adduct that remains after processing by one of
the workup procedures. The performance PM,Ad (%) was calculated from PM,Ad = RM,Ad × ISM,Ad/100% with the
recovery RM,Ad of one of the enrichment
methods (Table S-3, Supporting Information) and the remaining signal reduced by ion suppression ISM,Ad (Table

b The MRM analyses of herring sperm
DNA digests showed a substantial background noise in the trace of
255.1 → 139 of the internal standard [15N3]3,N4-εdC that prohibited the evaluation.

Chromatographic Separation
of DNA Adducts
The increase
in simultaneously recorded mass spectrometric fragmentations goes
hand in hand with a loss of chromatographic resolution. Thus, the
time windows for the detection of single DNA adducts by MRM were narrowed
to about 60 s. In addition, an optimal chromatographic separation
of the adduct mixtures is essential. Usually, DNA adducts are separated
via reversed-phase columns using acidic solvents which support the
protonation of the exocyclic amino groups in adducts of dG, 2′-deoxyadenosine
(dA), and 2′-deoxycytidine (dC).10 In our work group, the chromatography of DNA adducts derived from
single carcinogens was conventionally performed with a UPLC system
and an eluting gradient of water and acetonitrile which were acidified
with acetic acid and formic acid.23−25,27,37,38 We adjusted the method successfully allowing for the separation
of all DNA adducts included in this study within about 12 min. Figure
S-2 in the Supporting Information shows
the chromatograms of the quantifier traces from the isotope-labeled
reference substances after a joint injection.

Recently, Yin
et al. reported on the chromatographic separation of acrolein-derived
DNA adducts 6-hydroxy-1,N2-propano-dG
and 8-hydroxy-1,N2-propano-dG testing
different eluents.33 The use of the ammonium
bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.0) led to narrower peaks and superior sensitivity
of mass spectrometric detection compared to other test eluents containing,
e.g., formic acid or ammonium acetate. The ammonium bicarbonate fragments
into carbon dioxide and ammonia in the heated gas phase. Yin et al.
proposed that ammonium ions suppress the formation of signal-reducing
metal complexes of the analytes.33 Here,
we compared the LOD values of the 16 analytes using either acetic
acid and formic acid or ammonium bicarbonate as eluent additives (Table 2). The application of the ammonium bicarbonate as
solvent additive resulted in slightly increased sensitivities for
the mass spectrometric detection of most of the analytes except N6-MIE-dA and the hydrophobic “bulky adducts” C8-PhIP-dG, N2-BPDE-dG, N2-MP-dG, and N6-MP-dA.

DNA Adducts in Tissue Samples of Human Lung
The previous
results showed that none of the combinations of extraction and chromatographic
separation was optimal for the simultaneous detection of all DNA adducts.
We chose to use the 1-butanol extraction for the adduct enrichment
and ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.0) and methanol as eluents A
and B, respectively, for the subsequent UPLC-MS/MS analyses. The simultaneous
analysis of the 16 adducts in DNA isolated from ten human lung samples
allowed one to readily detect six of the adducts in some or all of
the samples. The adduct levels summarized in Table 3 were calculated from the strongest signals (“quantifier
peaks”, compare Table S-2, Supporting Information) of the analytes. The validity of detection of particular adducts
was checked by the observance of up to two qualifier signals. Further
confirmation provided the area ratio of the quantifier peak and the
most prominent qualifier peak, which usually was in the range of the
corresponding values determined for the isotope-labeled reference
substance in the ten samples.

a For each of the analyses, about
500 μg of DNA was isolated from separate portions of 0.5 to
1 g of lung tissue. After enzymatic hydrolysis of 350 μg of
DNA, the adducts were extracted with 1-butanol. Details are described
in the Experimental Section. Hyphens (−) indicate
adduct levels below the LOD.

b The arithmetic mean was calculated
with values of LOD/2 (Table 2) for those adduct
levels < LOD.

c The ratio
of the peak areas from
the quantifier signal and the most prominent qualifier was not in
the range of the corresponding ratios calculated from the signals
of the internal standard.

The etheno adducts 1,N6-εdA and
3,N4-εdC were the most abundant
adducts detected in the samples of human lung. These adducts are formed
from the reactions of the DNA bases with 2,3-epoxyaldehydes of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal
or croton aldehyde39 and were previously
quantified in human DNA by 32P-postlabeling and immunodetection
techniques.40,41 Interestingly, the adduct levels
were shown to increase in affected tissues of persons with some inherited
cancer risk factors, e.g., Wilson’s disease40 or familial adenomatous polyposis.42 There are only few studies of etheno adducts in human DNA samples
using specific LC-MS/MS techniques and isotope-labeled reference compounds.
Thus, 1,N6-εdA was found at high
levels in commercial placental DNA (73.2 adducts/108 nucleosides)43 or in gastric mucosa and lung in the range of
11.9–276.3 adducts/108 nucleosides (n = 22)44 and 4.0–246.3 adducts/108 nucleosides (n = 12),21 respectively. Also in the current work, 1,N6-εdA and, in addition, 3,N4-εdC were detected in human pulmonary DNA. Representative
chromatograms of the fragmentations of 1,N6-εdA and 3,N4-εdC and their
reference compounds are shown in Figure 1.
In the first analysis, the adduct levels were from 16.9–74.9
1,N6-εdA/108 nucleosides
and 27.2–102.9 3,N4-εdC/108 nucleosides (Table 3). In contrast,
we did not detect M1dG, the main adduct of the lipid peroxidation
product malondialdehyde in spite of a favorable LOD. We observed that
the internal reference [15N3]M1dG did not survive
the conditions of the DNA hydrolysis (pH ∼ 10). This is probably
due to hydrolytic ring-opening to N2-oxopropenyl-dG,
the major degradation pathway of M1dG previously studied under basic
conditions (pH 11.2).45

containing 1,N6-εdA and 3,N4-εdC. The chromatogram of 1,N6-εdA (m/z = 276.1
→ 160.0, A) is shown together with the parallel recording of
[15N5]1,N6-εdA
(m/z = 281.1 → 165.0, B).
Panels C and D show the neutral loss of the 2′-deoxyribose

The adducts of furfuryl alcohol N2-MF-dG
and N6-MF-dA were detected for the first
time in human DNA. The furan derivative is a carcinogen of moderate
potency;46 however, it is abundant in heat-processed
foods.47 In the first analysis of this
study, we identified N2-MF-dG in nine
out of ten DNA samples in the range of 0.2–10.4 N2-MF-dG/108 nucleosides (Table 3). Figure 2 shows exemplary chromatograms
of N2-MF-dG detected by three transitions
together with the reference compound [15N5,13C10]N2-MF-dG. The
MRM analysis of N6-MF-dA yielded clear
quantifier signals (m/z = 332.1
→ 216.1) in most samples; however, the detection of both qualifier
peaks was compromised by background noise (Figure S-3, Supporting Information). Consequently, only three
samples contained N6-MF-dA (0.88–1.76
adducts/108 nucleosides) at levels that allowed verification
with qualifier peaks of satisfactory intensity. In previous animal
experiments, N2-MF-dG and N6-MF-dA were detected in liver, kidney, and lung of mice
after a single administration of furfuryl alcohol or after a four-week
exposure via drinking water.27 A recent
study in mice indicated that the pulmonary genotoxic effect may originate
in great part from hepatic sulfo conjugation of furfuryl alcohol and
transport of the reactive sulfate ester to the lung via the bloodstream.48 In addition, furfuryl alcohol is a common volatile
organic compound also present in samples of indoor dust (0.4–500
μg furfuryl alcohol/g dust, n = 340 residences)
and consequently may also be taken up by inhalation.49

Figure 2 UPLC-MS/MS chromatograms of a digested DNA sample isolated from
lung tissue of patient 8 containing N2-MF-dG. The left panels depict the chromatograms of N2-MF-dG with the fragmentations m/z = 348.1 → 232.0 (A), m/z = 348.1 → 164.0 (B), and m/z = 348.1 → 81.1 (C). The most intensive signal (m/z = 348.1 → 232.0) was used as
quantifier signal. Simultaneously, the transitions m/z = 363.1 → 242.0 (D), m/z = 363.1 → 174.0 (E), and m/z = 363.1 → 81.1 (F) of the internal isotope-labeled
standard [15N5,13C10]N2-MF-dG were monitored. Figure S-3 in the Supporting Information shows the chromatograms
of the N6-MF-dA detection in the DNA of
the same lung sample.

Methyleugenol is an alkenylbenzene present in herbs, spices,
and
essential oils and is used as a flavoring additive in the food and
cosmetic industry. It is a strong hepatocarcinogen in rodents.50 The methyleugenol adducts N6-MIE-dA and N2-MIE-dG, which
were recently quantified by UPLC-MS/MS in 29 out of 30 DNA samples
of human liver,22 were also detected in
the current study. Chromatograms of three N2-MIE-dG fragmentations and those of the reference compound [15N5]N2-MIE-dG are shown
in Figure 3. Figure S-4 in the Supporting Information depicts corresponding
chromatograms of N6-MIE-dA and [15N5]N6-MIE-dA. In the first
analysis, N6-MIE-dA levels were determined
in five of ten samples with levels from 0.31 to 1.18 adducts/108 nucleosides, whereas N2-MIE-dG
was readily detectable in all samples containing 1.7–23.7 adducts/108 nucleosides. The mean N2-MIE-dG
level was 27-fold higher compared to the average N6-MIE-dA level. In previous studies, the levels of N2-MIE-dG exceeded those of N6-MIE-dA by about 60-fold in the human liver22 and by 35-fold in the liver of FVB/N mice treated
orally with methyleugenol.37 This is the
first study, in which N6-MIE-dA and N2-MIE-dG were detected in pulmonary DNA of humans.
Substantial levels, up to 126 N2-MIE-dG/108 nucleosides, were also present in the lung of FVB/N mice
genetically engineered for the expression of human SULT1A1/1A2 that
received a single oral dose of 50 mg methyleugenol/kg body weight
(Herrmann, K. and Glatt, H. R., manuscript in preparation).

Figure 3 UPLC-MS/MS
chromatograms of a digested DNA sample isolated from
patient 6 that contained the methyleugenol adduct N2-MIE-dG. Panels on the left-hand side show the chromatograms
of N2-MIE-dG with the fragmentations m/z = 444.1 →328.1 (A), m/z = 444.1 → 177.1 (B), and m/z = 444.1 → 164.1 (C). The most
intensive signal (m/z = 444.1 →
328.1) was used as quantifier signal. On the right-hand side are the
parallel recordings of the transitions m/z = 449.1 → 333.1 (D), m/z = 449.1 → 177.1 (E), and m/z = 449.1 → 169.1 (F) of the isotope-labeled standard
[15N5]N2-MIE-dG.
Figure S-4 in the Supporting Information shows the chromatograms of the N6-MIE-dA
detection in the DNA of the same lung sample.

The simultaneous analysis of the adducts was performed a
second
time using the same protocol as described above but in DNA samples
isolated from distinct lung tissue specimens of the same patients
(Table 3, second analysis). In most, but not
in all cases, the results of the second analysis were in good agreement
with the first analysis. The overall picture is described by the average
values of adduct levels, which deviate only slightly between first
and second analysis, and by correlations of first and second analytical
results depicted in Figure S-5, Supporting Information. For example, the 1,N6-εdA levels
in the lung sample patients 1, 5, 9, and 10 were the highest in both
quantifications (m = 1.13, r2 = 0.632). Also, the maximum levels of N2-MF-dG were detected in samples from patients 2, 8, and 9
in both analytical runs (m = 1.04, r2 = 0.987). However, in some cases, strong deviations
between pairs of results from first and second analysis were also
observed. For example, the N2-MIE-dG levels
in patients 4, 5, and 10 vary considerably between both analytical
runs (m = 0.98, r2 =
0.304).

Conclusions
For the combined analysis
of 16 structurally and chemically diverse
DNA adducts, we optimized a method for the posthydrolytic enrichment
and the chromatographic separation of the analytes. In the pulmonary
DNA of ten lung cancer patients, we detected high levels of adducts
of lipid peroxidation products (1,N6-εdA,
3,N4-εdC), of the secondary plant
metabolite methyleugenol (N6-MIE-dA, N2-MIE-dG), and of the food contaminant furfuryl
alcohol (N6-MF-dA, N2-MF-dG). In contrast, adducts of common environmental carcinogens
that are also present in tobacco smoke, e.g., benzo[a]pyrene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and 1-methylpyrene, were not detectable.
In some previous studies, adducts of benzo[a]pyrene
were detected in human lung by HPLC and fluorescence detection,51 and one work reported the presence of C8-ABP-dG in 25 samples of human pulmonary tissue by immunochemistry
and 32P-postlabeling.52 Recently,
the data were questioned due to the low specificity of the detection
methods.10,12 In agreement with the current work, no reports
were published hitherto on the specific LC-MS/MS detection of DNA
adducts of the common carcinogens included here, especially those
of benzo[a]pyrene, 1-methylpyrene, PhIP, and 4-aminobiphenyl,
in specimens of human pulmonary DNA.

In part, the results can
be explained by the large variation in
human intake amounts. The use of furfuryl alcohol as a flavoring agent
alone leads to a possible average daily intake of 1.3 μmol/kg
body weight.53 The estimated average daily
intake of methyleugenol is 56.1 nmol/kg body weight,54 which exceeds the average daily doses of benzo[a]pyrene (31.7 pmol/kg body weight)55 and PhIP (26.8 pmol/kg body weight)56 by factors of 1700 and 2100, respectively. Other parameters may
greatly influence the tissue concentration of a particular DNA adduct,
e.g., the toxicokinetic properties of the genotoxicant, the transport
of metabolites, the reactivity of the ultimate carcinogen, and the
DNA repair. In view of the current results, it is interesting to note
that the estimated carcinogenic hazard of methyleugenol (defined by
the margin between the daily human intake and the lowest dose that
induced a specific tumor in an animal model) is about 25-fold and
100-fold greater than the hazards of benzo[a]pyrene
and PhIP, respectively.57 However, the
mutagenic potency and the persistence of DNA adducts of different
substances may vary greatly,1 and thus,
the current results do not allow speculations on the carcinogenic
effect of one of the substances in the lung. Future work is aimed
at the DNA adduct monitoring in a larger library of specimens from
healthy individuals and tumor patients, for which data on diet and
smoking history are available.
