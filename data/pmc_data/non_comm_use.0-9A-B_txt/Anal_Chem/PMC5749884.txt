Single-walled
carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) offer unique electrical
and optical properties. Common synthesis processes yield SWNTs with
large length polydispersity (several tens of nanometers up to centimeters)
and heterogeneous electrical and optical properties. Applications
often require suitable selection and purification. Dielectrophoresis
is one manipulation method for separating SWNTs based on dielectric
properties and geometry. Here, we present a study of surfactant and
single-stranded DNA-wrapped SWNTs suspended in aqueous solutions manipulated
by insulator-based dielectrophoresis (iDEP). This method allows us
to manipulate SWNTs with the help of arrays of insulating posts in
a microfluidic device around which electric field gradients are created
by the application of an electric potential to the extremities of
the device. Semiconducting SWNTs were imaged during dielectrophoretic
manipulation with fluorescence microscopy making use of their fluorescence
emission in the near IR. We demonstrate SWNT trapping at low-frequency
alternating current (AC) electric fields with applied potentials not
exceeding 1000 V. Interestingly, suspended SWNTs showed both positive
and negative dielectrophoresis, which we attribute to their ζ
potential and the suspension properties. Such behavior agrees with
common theoretical models for nanoparticle dielectrophoresis. We further
show that the measured ζ potentials and suspension properties
are in excellent agreement with a numerical model predicting the trapping
locations in the iDEP device. This study is fundamental for the future
application of low-frequency AC iDEP for technological applications
of SWNTs.

==== Body
Single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWNTs) possess unique electronic, mechanical, optical, and structural
properties which can be exploited for future nanoscale applications.1−6 Their use in nanoscale electronics ranges from field-effect Schottky-type
transistors,3,6,7 nanometer-sized
semiconducting devices, probes,8 and data
storage or field emission sensors2 to biological
transporters and biosensors.9 SWNTs have
also been exploited as mechanical sensors in living cells thanks to
their unique fluorescence properties including superb photostability10,11 and fluorescence emission in the IR range12−14 where autofluorescence
in biological samples is minimal.

Typically, SWNTs are produced
in processes yielding mixtures with
broadly dispersed diameters, lengths (from 10 nm up to 1 cm),15 and chirality. Chirality is important to determine
electrical and optical properties of SWNTs.16,17 Producing SWNTs with defined lengths or chiralities has not been
achieved. One of the most successful fabrication methods is the high-pressure
carbon monoxide (HiPco) process, yielding SWNTs in diameters of ∼1
nm, lengths from several tens of nanometers to a few micrometers,
and preferred, but not unique, chirality.18,19 In addition, SWNTs form adducts and bundles through van der Waals
forces14 during fabrication. Applications
of SWNTs thus require overcoming the challenges related to postsynthesis
separation steps.

Various separation methods of SWNTs have been
reported according
to their electronic type,20,21 and these separated
nanotubes can be used in future electronic device components.22 In applications requiring SWNTs in aqueous solutions,
they must be suspended using a surfactant or wrapping agent, which
in turn influences their surface charge and ζ potential. Sorting
of suspended SWNTs has been attempted with ion-exchange23 and size-exclusion chromatography.24 The combination of the two has even allowed
the separation of similar sized diameter SWNTs by chirality.25 The method is however not generally applicable
to samples with large variation in diameters or chirality. Ultracentrifugation
including density gradient methods has been used for sorting, yielding
small amounts that can be employed for selected applications.26 In addition, the unique chemical reactivity
of ends or side walls of SWNTs has been exploited for sorting as well
as to selectively break down nondesired species in SWNT mixtures through
etching approaches.27 Sorting of SWNTs
can also be carried out in direct current electric fields via electrophoresis
employing sieving matrices.28,29

An alternative
electrical separation method for SWNTs is dielectrophoresis.
Alternating current dielectrophoresis (AC DEP) has gained attention
as a potential technique for sorting carbon nanotubes according to
their electrical properties.4,30−32 When a cylindrical nanotube is placed in a nonuniform electric field,
it will experience a force due to the induced dipole moment.4,33 Depending on the polarization properties of the nanoparticles and
the surrounding medium, particles can be manipulated or trapped using
DEP. Particles experiencing positive DEP (pDEP) drift toward the regions
of largest electric field strength, while the underlying dielectrophoretic
force is proportional to the carbon nanotube length.34 The dielectrophoretic force strongly depends on the frequency
of the electric field and the frequency-dependent electrical properties
of the particles, typically described by a frequency-dependent Clausius–Mossotti
relation. The DEP behavior of SWNTs can be tuned with the applied
frequency. It has been reported that metallic carbon nanotubes always
experience pDEP due to their large dielectric constant.4 Depending on the electric field frequency and
particle surface conductivity, semiconducting SWNTs can show either
positive or negative DEP.17,30,31 Therefore, DEP has been used to separate metallic from semiconducting
SWNTs.4,35 The transport and trapping properties of
DEP can also be employed as a means to control large-scale or even
single-SWNT deposition for electronic applications.36,37 Inhomogeneous electric fields for AC DEP can be generated in two
different ways: (i) by introducing microelectrodes in a sample chamber
or (ii) by constructing topological structures between macroelectrodes.38 Electrode-based DEP (eDEP) is an established
method where micrometer-sized electrodes are patterned on a substrate.
These electrodes can be quadruple electrodes,39 pairs of electrodes at close distance,40 or interdigitated electrodes.34 With
eDEP, high frequencies can be reached, and the DEP response of nanoparticles
can be investigated in the kHz to MHz regime. The other, newer approach
is insulator-based DEP (iDEP) where different dielectric obstacles
are introduced in a microfluidic channel producing inhomogeneous electric
fields when an electrical potential is applied between the access
ports of the microfluidic device.41 With
an iDEP device, DC and low-frequency DEP behavior of particles can
be examined.42 iDEP devices avoid chemical
electrode reactions that can occur in eDEP applications, fabrication
steps are facilitated, and the electric field gradient can be generated
along the entire depth of microfluidic devices.43,44

iDEP at low frequencies, <1 kHz, as an alternative approach
to manipulate SWNTs has not been used in the past. At low frequencies,
the DEP of nanoparticles is mainly governed by their conductivity
and that of the surrounding medium45,46 (see Theory for more detail) and critically depends on
the wrapping agent used to suspend the SWNTs.30 We here report on the DEP characteristics of SWNTs using an insulator-based
microfluidic system. We have studied the dielectrophoretic behavior
of SWNTs wrapped with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or with sodium deoxycholate
(NaDOC) at frequencies up to 1 kHz. The resultant DEP trapping behavior
of semiconducting SWNTs was investigated by infrared fluorescence
microscopy in an elastomer microfluidic channel. We correlate the
observed dielectrophoretic behavior with differences in the ζ
potential, which, in turn, depends on the method used for the suspension
of the investigated SWNTs.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
SWNTs
(batch no. 189.2) were obtained from
Rice University (TX, USA) through a materials transfer agreement.
Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was purchased from Merck KGaA (Germany), N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-2-ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES), single-stranded DNA composed of 30 tyrosine bases (dT30),
sodium deoxycholate, and Pluronic F-108 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(MO, USA). Muscovite Mica (V-5; sheet size, 50 × 75 mm2; thickness, 0.15–0.21 mm) was purchased from Science Service
(Germany) and (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) was obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich. Sylgard silicone elastomer kit for poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS) was obtained from Dow Corning Corp. (MI, USA). Glass slides
(40 mm × 50 mm) were from Menzel GmbH and purchased through Thermo
Scientific (Germany). Deionized (DI) water was produced using an Arium
611 ultrapure water system from Sartorius (Germany).

Microchip Fabrication
The microfluidic chip layout
was designed with AutoCAD and then patterned on a silicon wafer by
standard photolithography as reported previously. From this master
wafer, a PDMS mold was prepared via standard soft lithography procedures.47 Briefly, liquid PDMS was mixed with PDMS curing
agent in a ratio of 10:1 (w/w). The mixture was poured on the master
wafer, degassed using a vacuum desiccator, and heated in an oven for
4 h at 80 °C. The mold was subsequently removed from the master
wafer, and 3 mm diameter reservoirs were punched manually by a puncher
at the beginning and end of the post array portion of the corresponding
microchannel. The PDMS mold was cut into slabs of appropriate size,
and these slabs and glass slides were cleaned with isopropanol and
distilled water, dried with a stream of nitrogen, and baked on a hot
plate at 90 °C until completely dried. Both surfaces were activated
with an oxygen plasma (PDC-001; Harrick Plasma cleaner/sterilizer,
USA) at high power (18 W) for 30 s. After the plasma treatment, the
PDMS slab was pressed against a glass slide to form a closed microchannel
system and then placed on a hot plate at 90 °C for 3–5
min. The chamber was then filled with DI water and washed several
times with DI water by suction, and then the surface was treated with
Pluronic F108 (1% (w/v)) and incubated overnight prior to use as described
previously.48 With surface treatment, particles
can experience strong DEP force and can be immobilized at the dielectric
obstacles, even at higher medium conductivity.45,46

The PDMS channel was 1.5 cm long with an integrated post array
section over ∼1 cm as shown in Figure 1c. The posts had a diameter of 10 μm,
the row distance was also 10 μm, and the post to post distance
in one row was 5 μm.

SWNT Sample Preparation
SWNTs were
solubilized by wrapping
with either surfactant (NaDOC) or single-stranded DNA (dT30). NaDOC
(1% (w/v)) was dissolved in 10 mM HEPES buffer at pH 7. A glass scintillation
vial was cleaned with ethanol and dried with a stream of nitrogen.
Then, ∼2 mg of SWNTs were carefully transferred to the clean
vial with a spatula, and 2mL of NaDOC solution were added. The vial
was placed in a bucket with ice and sonicated with a 2 mm Microtip
sonicator (Sonics & Material Inc., Danbury, CT, USA) at 20 kHz
and 20 W. Two types of NaDOC-coated SWNT samples were prepared. Sample
A was prepared by 20 min sonication, and sample B was prepared by
60 min sonication. After sonication, the SWNT suspension was transferred
to an Eppendorf vial and centrifuged (Sigma 1–14 centrifuge,
Germany) at 14000 rpm for 15 min. After centrifugation, the pellet
was discarded, and the supernatant was collected to be used in experiments
and stored at 4 °C.

For ssDNA wrapping of SWNTs, DI water
was added at a ratio of 1:1 (w/w) to dry ssDNA to yield about 0.5
mL of 1 mg/mL concentration. The vial was centrifuged at low spin
speed for a few seconds and vortexed for a few seconds repeatedly
for approximately 5 min to ensure homogeneous solubilizing of ssDNA.
In the next step, ∼1 mg of SWNTs was transferred to a clean
glass scintillation vial, and DNA solution was added to the SWNTs.
Then the sample was sonicated at 20 kHz and 20 W for 90 min as described
above. After sonication, the sample was ultracentrifuged (Optima Ultracentrifuge
28000 rpm, Beckman Coulter, Germany) for 90 min at 4 °C. After
centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and stored at 4 °C
prior to experiments. Surface charge was measured with a Zetasizer
Nano ZS instrument (Malvern, USA). Five trials were made, and the
average ζ potential value was determined. An Orion-3 Star conductivity
meter from Thermo Scientific was used for measuring the medium conductivity.
The conductivity meter was calibrated with a standard NaCl solution
(conductivity of 0.1413 S/cm and 692 ppm).

SWNT Imaging
SWNTs
were imaged as previously reported.9 Briefly,
a sample rich in fluorescent (6, 5)
carbon nanotubes with an excitation maximum of 567 nm and emission
maximum of 975 nm were used in this work. SWNTs were excited by a
561 nm DPSS laser (500 mW cw; Cobolt Jive; Cobolt). A neutral density
filter (NDC-50C-4M, Thorlabs) served to adjust the intensity of the
beam. The laser beam was directed into the back aperture of a high-NA
objective (CFI Plan-Apo IR, 60×, NA = 1.27; Nikon, Japan). Fluorescence
light was collected through the same objective and passed through
a dichroic beam splitter (630 DCXR; AHF Analysentechnik), further
filtered using a 900 nm long-pass filter (F47-900; AHF Analysentechnik)
and focused on a short-wave infrared (SWIR) camera with an InGaAs
detector (XEVA-SHS-1.7-320 TE-1, Xenics). Images of SWNTs were recorded
with 100 ms exposure times. Data analysis was performed with ImageJ
software. Five trapping regions were chosen in each case from a representative
image, and pixel intensities were extracted, averaged, and normalized
with the largest intensity in each case. Origin 8.5 software was used
for plotting the normalized data with associated error bars at the
different applied potentials.

Atomic Force Microscopy
Atomic force microscopy (AFM)
was used to determine lengths and diameters of the SWNTs. The SWNT
suspensions were incubated on mica surfaces (Grade V1, Ted Pella,
Inc., USA) for 15 min, washed with DI water, and dried. A Nanotec
AFM instrument (Nanotec, Spain) was used for imaging SWNTs in tapping
mode in air. SWNT length was measured for about 100 nanotubes for
each sample.

Computation of Electric Field Distributions
A section
of the microfluidic device matching the post array geometry was drawn
in COMSOL Multiphysics version 5.2a. Domains for the microchannel
material and solvent were assigned and material properties chosen
according to predefined parameters in COMSOL for PDMS and water. The
electric field in the designed geometry was solved with the Electric
Current module choosing a stationary, time-independent solver. The
program solves Maxwell’s equations with appropriate boundary
conditions, with the posts and side walls considered as electrical
insulators. The electrical potential was applied between the inlet
boundary and the outlet boundary. In addition, COMSOL was used to
compute particle trajectories and investigate the DEP trapping regions
of SWNTs in the post array. Details are provided in the Supporting Information.

Theory
Following the literature, we briefly describe the DEP force on
a single-walled carbon nanotube. When a cylindrical solid particle
is placed in a nonuniform DC electric field, it experiences a dielectric
force which can be expressed as34,46,49 1  where εm is the
medium permittivity,  is a geometry factor and r and l are the radius and length of the particle,
respectively. In the case of a hollow tube, the geometry factor will
be replaced by πlδ(2r – δ) with the wall thickness δ. E is the electric field and Re(CM) is the real part
of the Clausius–Mossotti factor. The DEP force acting on a
SWNT depends on the radius and length as well as the magnitude and
sign of the Clausius–Mossotti factor (CM), which describes
the electrical polarizability of the material:30,31,50 2  with 3  where εp is the permittivity
of the particle; σm and σp are the
conductivity of the medium and particle, respectively; ω is
the frequency; and L denotes the dimensionless depolarization
factor parallel to the electric field and along the long axis of the
nanotube, which is defined as46 4  

If a suspended particle
has a higher polarizability than the medium,
the particle is driven toward the region of higher electric field;
i.e., particles accumulate where the field has a maximum, which is
referred to as positive DEP (pDEP). In contrast, if the polarizability
of a suspended particle is lower than that of the medium, it moves
toward the region of lower electric field; i.e., particles accumulate
where the field has a minimum, which is termed negative DEP (nDEP).
In other words, nanotubes with Re(CM) > 0 experience
pDEP and nanotubes with Re(CM) < 0 experience
nDEP. The real part of eq 2 is 5  For
ω → 0, Re(CM) becomes 6  It can thus be seen from eq 6 that Re(CM) in the low-frequency
range only depends on the medium conductivity, particle conductivity,
and depolarization factor relating to the length and diameter of the
SWNTs.

The Clausius–Mossotti factor for SWNTs can be
estimated
based on intrinsic parameters. The relative permittivity for metallic
and semiconducting SWNTs was reported as 4000 and 5, respectively.4,30 For nanoparticles, it has been shown that the effective particle
conductivity consists of the intrinsic conductivity and of surface
conductivity near the particle. The total particle conductivity can
be expressed as51 7  where σint is the intrinsic
particle conductivity, λs is the surface conductance,
and a is the radius of a spherical particle. It was
reported that the radius of sodium dodecyl sulfate suspended SWNTs
is approximately 2.7 nm because a double layer is formed around the
radial direction of the nanotubes.30 This
value was used for the particle conductivity calculation in this study.
The internal conductivity of semiconducting SWNTs can be taken as
approximately zero because of the large band gap.30 The surface conductance λs is the sum
of the diffuse layer conductance, λs,d, and the Stern
layer conductance, λs,s, where the ratio of diffuse
layer conductance and Stern layer conductance has been reported as
0.56.52 The diffuse layer conductance can
be calculated from the ζ potential of SWNTs and the properties
of the electrolyte, using the following equations:30,53 8  with 9   10  

Here, λs,d is the
diffuse layer conductance, q is the charge of an
electron, D is the
diffusion constant, kB is the Boltzmann
constant, m is the contribution from electro-osmotic
transport, β is the reciprocal Debye length, η is the
viscosity of the solution, z is the valence of the
ion, and n is the ion concentration. The surface
conductivity can be obtained from the ζ potential, which was
assessed experimentally in this study (see Table 1). The effective particle conductivity can
then be calculated using eqs 8–10, the surface conductivity
λs (= λs,d + λs,s) and eq 6. Note that
this calculation accounts for an ideally suspended SWNT with no interactions
with other particles or aggregation. Results for SWNTs probed in this
study are depicted in Figure 5. Parameters used were q = 1.60 × 10–19 C, n = 2.05 × 1025 m–3 for NaDOC-wrapped SWNTs (n = 5.5 × 1023 m–3 for ssDNA-wrapped
SWNTs), z = 1, kB = 1.38
× 10–23 J K–1, T = 297 K, D+ = 1.334 × 10–9 m2 s–1, D– = 1.334 × 10–9 m2 s–1, η = 0.890 × 10–3 K g m–1 s–1 (for water) as well as the permittivity of
water ε = 80 ε0 with ε0 =
8.854 × 10–12 F m–1.

Results and Discussion
For this study, SWNTs were solubilized by wrapping with the surfactant
NaDOC or with dT30 single-stranded DNA, and their iDEP behavior was
studied in a microfluidic device. Panels a and b of Figure 1 show AFM images of NaDOC- and DNA-wrapped SWNTs together with schematic
drawings of wrapping. AFM imaging revealed a height of 1.52 ±
0.6 nm for NaDOC-coated SWNTs and an average length of 1050 ±
610 nm. For SWNTs wrapped with ssDNA, an average height of 1.33 ±
0.64 nm was found as well as an average length of 1100 ± 550
nm. A PDMS microfluidic chip was used to test the DEP behavior in
trapping experiments as shown in Figure 1c. Figure 1d represents the numerically calculated electric field
in the circular post array in a representative section of the device.
We present iDEP trapping results for two NaDOC-wrapped SWNT samples
differing in the sonication time during suspension and one ssDNA-wrapped
SWNT sample, as listed in Table 1. All results presented below relate to semiconducting
SWNTs observed through their infrared fluorescence upon excitation
with a 561 nm laser. Metallic SWNTs do not fluoresce and are not probed
with our method.

red arrow (large), pointing toward the region with the highest electric
field).

Prediction of iDEP Trapping Regions for SWNTs
Depending
on the sign of Re(CM), nDEP or pDEP particle trapping
may occur. Since SWNT DEP trapping behavior at low frequencies has
not been reported previously, we developed a numerical model to predict
the trapping locations of SWNTs in an iDEP microfluidic device using
COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2a. The model accounts for the device geometry,
applied potentials scaled to the device section modeled, the resulting
electric field as well as electric field gradients, and diffusion
properties of the particles and allows one to track the particle positions
due to DEP forces in a time-dependent manner. Particles are released
at specific positions within the post array section, and their migration
can be traced over time. Figure 2 shows the results of simulations for the nDEP and
pDEP case. SWNTs released between two post rows and subject to DEP
forces consistent with a negative Re(CM) accumulate
in the region between two posts of neighboring columns, as shown in Figure 2a. These locations
correspond to the lowest electric field regions as indicated by the
gray-scale coloring of the fluid-filled space of the device. Figure 2b represents pDEP
trapping behavior of SWNTs consistent with a positive Re(CM) . In this case, SWNTs are trapped between two posts of the same
column, where the strength of the electric field is the highest. Thus,
the pDEP trapping regions are clearly distinct from the nDEP trapping
regions. Note that the model parameters were adapted to reflect the
case of sample A (nDEP) and sample B (pDEP) for NaDOC-wrapped SWNTs,
as experimentally investigated below. Details of the numerical model
as well as Movies S1 and S2 showing the migration of SWNTs to the final trapping positions
are available as Supporting Information.

Figure 2 Predicted trapping positions of SWNTs subject to iDEP. (a) SWNT
(shown as blue dots) trapping locations predicted by numerical modeling
for Re(CM) < 0. The potential applied to this
200 μm long section of the device was adapted to be consistent
with 1000 V applied over the entire 1.5 cm long microchannel. The
image shows the end position of 1000 SWNTs released from the vertical
lines drawn between the columns of posts. SWNTs experienced nDEP and
accumulated between two columns of posts where the electric field
strength is lowest. (b) SWNT trapping position predicted by numerical
modeling for Re(CM) > 0. The applied potential
is
the same as in panel a. The image shows the end position of 1000 SWNTs
(shown as red dots) released from the vertical lines between the columns.
SWNTs experienced pDEP and accumulated between consecutive posts in
the same row where the electric field strength is highest. The gray-scale
color of the fluid-filled part of the device in panels a and b indicates
electric field strength.

Experimental Observation of SWNT iDEP
Next, the iDEP
trapping behavior of two NaDOC-wrapped SWNT samples was studied. Applied
frequencies ranged between 0 and 1000 Hz and potentials between 0
and 1000 V across a channel of 1.5 cm length. Figure 3a shows an image of a microchannel filled
with NaDOC-suspended SWNTs without an externally applied potential.
SWNTs were evenly distributed around the posts in the channel. Panels
b and c of Figure 3 represent the trapping behavior of sample A probed at frequencies
of 70 and 700 Hz with an applied potential of 1000 V over the 1.5
cm long microfluidic channel. Figure 3b shows that NaDOC-wrapped SWNTs were trapped at the
left and right sides (x-direction) of a post at 70
Hz. These positions correspond to the lowest electric field strength
in the post array as apparent from comparison with Figure 1d and the electric field distribution
also shown in Figure 2a. The trapping positions correspond to those predicted by numerical
modeling assuming nDEP for SWNTs as demonstrated in Figure 2a, indicating excellent agreement
between experiment and the numerical model. The observed trapping
positions also correspond to those previously observed for polystyrene
beads exhibiting nDEP.46 At 700 Hz, NaDOC-suspended
SWNTs showed the same nDEP trapping behavior (Figure 3c). The trapping behavior was investigated
at frequencies up to 1000 Hz (data not shown), with the trapping positions
not changing in the post array. This indicates that the DEP behavior
is not frequency dependent in the range tested.

Figure 3 DEP trapping of NaDOC-wrapped
SWNTs. IR fluorescence imaging of
NaDOC-wrapped SWNTs subject to DEP trapping: (a) without applied potential,
no trapping observed; (b) potential of 1000 V applied over the entire
microchannel of 1.5 cm length at 70 Hz (external field direction horizontal)
for sample A (20 min sonication; SWNTs accumulated in the regions
of lowest electric field strength consistent with nDEP); (c) same
as panel b but at 700 Hz (SWNTs still accumulated in the regions of
lowest electric field strength consistent with nDEP); (d) for sample
B, SWNTs (60 min sonication) accumulated in the regions of highest
electric field strength, consistent with pDEP (scale bar, 20 μm
for panels a–d). Normalized fluorescence intensity indicative
of DEP trapping vs applied electric potential: (e) for sample A in
the regions where nDEP occurs; (f) similar to panel e but with sample
B for pDEP trapping regions.

We also note that some nanotubes were not trapped. We attribute
this to the large length distribution (approximately 400–1600
nm) of suspended SWNTs after the sonication process. Smaller SWNTs
do not experience large enough DEP forces to be trapped. In addition,
a residual flow can be caused by hydrostatic pressure differences
or electro-osmotic forces due to a DC voltage offset preventing smaller
SWNTs from being trapped.

Next, the DEP behavior of sample B
was investigated (Figure 3d) which was prepared with
60 min sonication time. We note that the location of DEP trapping
in the post array changed and was now consistent with pDEP; i.e.,
SWNTs accumulated at the regions with the highest field strength.
These trapping regions coincide well with the regions predicted by
numerical modeling, indicating excellent agreement between experiment
and modeling. However, the change from nDEP for sample A to pDEP for
sample B is unexpected and will be further examined below.

In
addition, the iDEP trapping behavior was studied for various
applied potentials by analyzing the fluorescence intensity in the
corresponding trapping regions. The fluorescence intensity is indicative
of SWNT concentration due to iDEP trapping. As shown in Figure 3e,f, for both sample A and
sample B, above a threshold potential of 300 V accumulation in the
pDEP or nDEP trapping regions occurred. In addition, a plateau was
reached in both cases upon which no significant increase in the concentration
of SWNTs in the trapping regions was observed. This can be explained
by the accumulation of all SWNTs experiencing a sufficiently large
DEP force.

Figure 4a shows
the trapping behavior of ssDNA-wrapped SWNTs, which were suspended
similarly to sample B by tip sonication for 90 min. At 700 Hz and
1000 V applied over the 1.5 cm long channel, the SWNTs accumulated
in the regions of highest electric field strength between posts, consistent
with pDEP. We note that, similarly to the NaDOC-wrapped SWNTs, some
ssDNA-wrapped SWNTs were not trapped. The pDEP trapping behavior for
ssDNA-wrapped SWNTs coincides with sample B of the NaDOC-wrapped SWNTs.
The potential origin for the variations in DEP behavior of SWNTs at
low frequencies probed in this study will be given in the next section. Figure 4b shows the trapping
behavior of ssDNA-wrapped SWNTs at varying applied potentials from
0 to 1200 V. No trapping was observed below 300 V. Above this potential,
SWNTs accumulated due to iDEP trapping, whereas a plateau was reached
above 600 V. We attribute this plateau to trapping of all available
SWNTs for which the DEP trapping force was large enough. Other smaller
SWNTs for which the trapping threshold was not reached were not trapped
and were still observed in regions of lower electric fields.

Figure 4 DEP trapping
of ssDNA-wrapped SWNTs. (a) IR fluorescence imaging
of ssDNA-wrapped SWNTs subject to DEP trapping. At 700 Hz and 1000
V applied over the entire microchannel of 1.5 cm length, ssDNA-wrapped
SWNTs accumulated in the regions of highest electric field strength,
consistent with pDEP (scale bar, 20 μm; external field direction
horizontal, along the x-direction). (b) Normalized
fluorescence intensity indicative of DEP trapping vs applied electric
potential for ssDNA-wrapped SWNTs in the regions where pDEP occurs.
The onset of trapping was observed around 300 V, and above 600 V the
fluorescence intensity reaches a plateau.

Origin of Low-Frequency DEP Behavior
of Suspended SWNT Species
In the low-frequency regime, the
DEP behavior of nanoparticles
is governed by their conductivities and that of the medium, determining
the magnitude and sign of the Clausius–Mossotti factor, as
shown in eq 6. The magnitude
of Re(CM) is thus expected to be independent of the
applied frequency in the range investigated in this work. Our experimental
observations are in agreement, since all SWNT preparations tested
showed frequency-independent iDEP trapping behavior in the range probed
(0–1000 Hz). Moreover, we observed nDEP or pDEP behavior dependent
on how samples were suspended. For NaDOC-suspended SWNTs, the type
of DEP behavior was dependent on the sonication time (samples A and
B). In the following we discuss possible factors giving rise to this
difference in DEP behavior.

According to established models
(eqs 1–6), Re(CM) of semiconducting SWNTs
is governed by the effective particle conductivity, which is dominantly
determined by the double-layer contributions arising from Stern layer
and diffuse layer conductance. The latter depends on the ζ potential
of the charged nanoparticle suspended in an electrolyte. It is well
documented in the literature, that the ζ potential of SWNTs
varies for different surfactants and surfactant concentrations.54,55 We thus independently measured the ζ potential of the SWNTs
prepared in the different manners. Table 1 lists the experimentally determined ζ
potentials for all samples for which the DEP behavior was studied
as well as some cases at even lower sonication time.

Sample
B, subjected to a longer sonication time, showed a ζ
potential of ζ = −58.6 ± 1.8 mV, which is in reasonable
agreement with the literature, considering variations in sonication
time and power as well as aqueous solution additives (in our case
HEPES buffer).55 Sample A with a shorter
sonication duration resulted in ζ = −20.2 ± 1.1
mV, about one-third of the value of sample B. Moreover, shorter sonication
times of 5 and 10 min resulted in ζ potentials slightly lower
than −20.2 mV. We attribute this large difference in ζ
potential to a less dense wrapping of the SWNTs with the surfactant
in samples A, C, and D. High ζ potentials typically indicate
a good stability of dispersed particles due to electrostatic repulsion
between suspended particles whereas lower ζ potentials are typically
an indication for a higher tendency of aggregation of dispersed particles.55 A ζ potential of only −20 mV could
therefore signify lower stability of the nanotube suspension and a
tendency to aggregate. Our findings are consistent with a report by
Mahbubul et al.56 who have shown a direct
correlation of the ζ potential with sonication time for aluminum
oxide nanoparticles suspended in aqueous solutions and the observation
by Zaib et al.57 that carbon nanotubes
increase their electrophoretic mobility and thus ζ potential
with longer sonication times.

The measured ζ potentials
can now be linked to the observed
DEP trapping. For this purpose, we further simplify eq 6 assuming a high aspect ratio, i.e.,
a vanishing depolarization factor, L. The nanotubes
employed in this work had an average length of ∼1000 nm and
diameter on the order of 1 nm. Therefore, L ∼
10–6, so that eq 6 can be further simplified to 11  where we define the conductivity ratio γ
as . For γ < 1, nDEP is prevalent
since Re(CM) < 0, whereas, for γ > 1, Re(CM) is positive resulting in pDEP. Figure 5a shows the dependence of Re(CM) on γ
indicating that the sign of the Clausius–Mossotti factor critically
depends on the medium used to suspend the SWNTs and the nanotube’s
surface conductivity.

Next, we examine the conductivity ratio
γ in the different
experimental conditions. For a given SWNT suspension, σm is defined by the solution employed during the suspension
process and can be assessed experimentally through conductivity measurement.
The particle conductivity is governed by the surface conductivity,
which in turn is defined via the diffuse layer and Stern layer conductance
as described in Theory. Based on the experimentally
determined ζ potentials, λs,d (eq 8) can be calculated, yielding σp according to eq 7. Table 1 lists the
calculated conductivity ratios for the SWNT samples. The calculated
particle conductivity was 0.14 S/m for NaDOC-wrapped SWNTs for sample
A, 2.94 S/m for sample B, and 0.53 S/m for DNA-wrapped SWNTs. The
medium conductivity was also determined experimentally and found to
be 0.15 S/m for both NaDOC-wrapped samples and 0.04 S/m for ssDNA-wrapped
SWNTs, respectively.

Figure 5a shows
the dependence of Re(CM) on the conductivity ratio
γ, with the symbols corresponding to SWNT samples studied experimentally.
For NaDOC-wrapped sample B, Re(CM) is positive with
a value of 18.6 corresponding to γ = 19.6. For DNA-wrapped SWNTs,
γ = 13.25 with a corresponding Re(CM) = 12.3.
This calculation matches the experimentally observed trapping behavior
of NaDOC-coated SWNTs (sample B) and ssDNA-wrapped SWNTs where pDEP
was observed. The numerical study underlines this experimental observation
since the trapping regions match in both model and experiment.

Figure 5 Calculated Re(CM) in dependence of γ and
ζ potential: (a) calculated Re(CM) vs γ
in the low-frequency regime, calculated for a frequency of 700 Hz;
red lines, for semiconducting NaDOC-wrapped SWNT; blue dashed line,
for semiconducting ssDNA-wrapped SWNTs (note that both curves coincide
in the low-frequency regime as Re(CM) is only governed
by the conductivity ratios); black dashed line, Re(CM) = 0; black triangle, blue square, and red circle, values for
sample A, sample B, and ssDNA-wrapped SWNTs, respectively; inset,
zoom in for low values of γ < 1, where negative Re(CM) prevails; (b) dependency of Re(CM) on ζ
potential for NaDOC-suspended SWNTs. The dashed line indicates Re(CM) = 0. It is apparent that Re(CM)
changes sign from positive to negative at low ζ potential (<21
mV).

We further examined the relationship
between ζ potential
and Re(CM) for the NaDOC-wrapped SWNTs. When ζ
drops, the Clausius–Mossotti factor decreases and eventually
becomes negative, leading to nDEP (Figure 5b). This occurs below a value of −21
mV. Note that the measured ζ potential of sample A is within
the region where the Re(CM) drops below zero (corresponding
to ζ < −21 mV) and that of sample B in the range where
a positive Re(CM) is expected according to Figure 5b. We thus conclude
that the SWNT dielectrophoretic behavior is dependent on the ζ
potential, which in turn is determined by the suspension quality,
i.e., sonication duration. This conclusion is in agreement with reports
by Kang et al., who observed a relation between the dielectrophoretic
behavior of surfactant-suspended SWNTs with the type of surfactant
and concomitant changes in the ζ potential.50 Similar observations were also recently made with biological
cells. Tang et al. reported that the dielectrophoretic behavior of
yeast cells changes through the surface interaction with surfactants
such as sodium dodecyl sulfate.58 Our observations
for the SWNT samples subject to short sonication times (20 min and
below) also agree with the commonly accepted zipping mechanism responsible
for SWNT suspension with surfactants.59,60 Sonication
is needed to unzip bundle ends of SWNTs followed by adsorption of
the charged surfactant and eventually leads to full unzipping and
release of individual SWNTs. At small sonication times, this process
is not fully finalized leading to a large distribution of species,
including a variety of large bundles, individual long SWNTs as well
as smaller individual SWNTs. Based on this mechanism we can also explain
why sample A, exhibiting a small negative ζ potential leading
to a very small negative Re(CM), can be trapped at
potentials similar to those of sample B. Since bundles and long SWNTs
are predominant in sample A, trapping occurs above 300 V similar to
shorter well dispersed SWNTs exhibiting a larger ζ potential
since the DEP forces are increased due to an overall larger geometry.
In summary, the observed pDEP trapping of NaDOC-suspended (sample
B) and ssDNA-wrapped SWNTs is in agreement with the observed ζ
potentials, models relating the ζ potential of nanoparticles
to the Clausius–Mossotti factor and suspension behavior of
individual SWNTs. The nDEP behavior observed in experiments for NaDOC-suspended
SWNTs prepared with shorter sonication time coincides with a smaller
ζ potential of not ideally suspended SWNTs and correspondingly
negative Re(CM).

Conclusions
We
have studied the DEP properties of semiconducting SWNTs in the
low-frequency regime (<1 kHz) with insulator-based dielectrophoresis,
a frequency range not previously investigated with SWNTs. The study
was carried out in PDMS microfluidic devices where the semiconducting
SWNTs could be visualized with near-infrared microscopy. As predicted
by established models, the observed DEP trapping behavior was frequency
independent. We could show, however, that the sign of the Clausius–Mossotti
factor can switch, depending on the ζ potential and the corresponding
suspension properties of the nanotubes. Well suspended NaDOC- and
ssDNA-wrapped SWNTs exhibited pDEP, which is in accordance with the
measured ζ potential and related positive Re(CM). In contrast, less densely NaDOC-wrapped SWNTs exhibited lower
ζ potential and demonstrated nDEP. The experimental observations
were in excellent agreement with numerical modeling. Our work shows
that carbon nanotubes can be effectively manipulated and even trapped
with iDEP in low-frequency AC electric fields and suggests that poorly
suspended constituents may be effectively removed in DEP sorters exploiting
the variations in pDEP and nDEP. Moreover, the DEP response can be
tuned by the surfactant properties and suspension quality, which may
in turn be exploited for optimization of purification and separation
of carbon nanotubes based on DEP or alignment and positioning of SWNTs.52 In addition, the near IR microscopy imaging
of DEP of semiconducting SWNT allows the observation of DEP trapping
and migration directly in a microfluidic device without the need for
post-DEP analysis involving Raman spectroscopy or nanoscale imaging
techniques following tedious recovery procedures.
