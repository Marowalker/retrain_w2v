In
this work, a novel droplet microfluidic sample introduction
system for inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) is
proposed and characterized. The cheap and disposable microfluidic
chip generates droplets of an aqueous sample in a stream of perfluorohexane
(PFH), which is also used to eject them as a liquid jet. The aqueous
droplets remain intact during the ejection and can be transported
into the ICP with >50% efficiency. The transport is realized via
a
custom-built system, which includes a membrane desolvator necessary
for the PFH vapor removal. The introduction system presented here
can generate highly monodisperse droplets in the size range of 40–60
μm at frequencies from 90 to 300 Hz. These droplets produced
very stable signals with a relative standard deviation (RSD) comparable
to the one achieved with a commercial droplet dispenser. Using the
current system, samples with a total volume of <1 μL can
be analyzed. Moreover, the capabilities of the setup for introduction
and quantitative elemental analysis of single cells were described
using a test system of bovine red blood cells. In the future, other
modules of the modern microfludics can be integrated in the chip,
such as on-chip sample pretreatment or parallel introduction of different
samples.

==== Body
Conventionally,
elemental analysis
of liquids in the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry
(ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS)
is realized by means of pneumatic nebulizers in combination with spray
chambers.1 The operating principle of such
a sample introduction system is
based on the conversion of a liquid into a polydisperse aerosol (nebulizer)
and subsequent filtering out of large droplets (spray chamber). These
systems exist in various geometries, are robust, and are routinely
used in many applications.2 Their main
drawback, however, is a high sample consumption (designed to run with
the liquid flow of >0.3 mL min–1)3 and an incomplete sample transport, which limit their applicability
for the analysis of micro sample volumes commonly available in biological,
forensic, toxicological, and clinical studies.4 Reducing the nebulizer nozzle dimensions has decreased the effective
sample consumption from a few milliliters per minute to microliters
per minute and even nanoliters per minute5 and has significantly enhanced the aerosol transport efficiency
(TE) thanks to a much lower sample uptake.4 These days, there are many variations of microflow nebulizers, which
can operate with close to 70–100% sample TE with or without
spray chambers6,7 and desolvation systems; these
include the microconcentric nebulizer,8 micromist nebulizer,8 high-efficiency
nebulizer,9 and direct injection high-efficiency
nebulizer.10 Reduction of the nebulizer
opening dimensions, however, leads directly to the increased risk
of clogging whenever samples containing highly concentrated salts
or undigested biological fluids have to be analyzed.4 In addition, the highest stability of the aerosol production
in microflow nebulizers is achieved by passive liquid uptake,11 whose rate depends on the pressure difference
at both ends of the nebulizer capillary that is directly determined
by the nebulizing gas flow rate. Since the range of the optimum flow
rate of this gas is normally very narrow, the flexibility of the system
in terms of the sample uptake is also limited.

A new concept
of injecting the liquid sample into the ICP in the
form of monodisperse discrete droplets was introduced by Olesik and
Hobbs.12 Uniform ≈50 μm droplets
could be produced on demand by a micropump,13 which ejected a defined liquid volume after capillary contraction,
and transported via a laminar flow oven into the ICP with 100% efficiency.
This system did not find wide application but has significantly contributed
to the fundamental understanding of analyte behavior in analytical
ICPs.14

A system for controlled generation
of monodisperse microdroplets
consisting of a piezoelectrically driven dispenser head, a control
box, and a droplet visualization system is commercially available
(Microdrop Technologies GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany). The droplets
can be produced in sizes of 30, 50, 70, and 100 μm in a frequency
range from 100 Hz to a few kilohertz with only 1% droplet variation
in volume, and liquid volume flow rates of picoliters per minute to
nanoliters per minute can be measured. The transport of these relatively
large droplets into the ICPMS was realized using ambient temperature
desolvation with helium15 instead of argon16 as a carrier gas.17,18 The droplets
can be transported into the plasma either vertically or horizontally,
depending on their size, with close to 100% efficiency.19 This system has already shown its potential
in quantitative analysis of single nanoparticles19,20 and characterization of individual biological cells by ICPMS,21 which has recently gained great interest in
the field of nanosafety22 and in cell biology.23 Another similar system based on the thermal
inkjet technology has been recently introduced24 and successfully applied to the elemental analysis of urine
using dosing frequency calibration.25

Even though the single-droplet introduction is very efficient and
promising for the analysis of micro sample volumes or single entities
such as nanoparticles and cells, the currently available microdispenser
modules have several drawbacks. They provide droplets with a fixed
volume, which is set by the nozzle diameter and can only slightly
be varied by dispenser settings (unless custom settings are used17), are sensitive to the changes of the physical
properties of the liquid (salt content, pH), are prone to clogging,
difficult to clean, and rather expensive. In addition, efficient and
nondestructive introduction of cells might be problematic due to the
passive liquid uptake through the capillary and the application of
a high voltage.

In this work a different approach to generate
microdroplets for
ICPMS analysis using droplet microfluidics is presented. Droplet microfluidics
has been intensively used for studying (bio)chemical reactions26−29 and for single-cell studies.30,31 Recently, it has been
proposed as a valuable system for sample preparation in matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry32 and as sample introduction system for electrospray mass spectrometry.33,34 In our interface, monodisperse aqueous droplets are produced using
the highly volatile carrier phase perfluorohexane (PFH) in a custom-designed
liquid-assisted droplet ejection (LADE) chip, which is made entirely
of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). The chip is cheap, disposable, can
produce droplets in a broader volume range and is more robust to changes
of liquid sample properties. Interfacing of the new chip with the
ICPMS was accomplished via a custom-built transport system including
a membrane desolvator, which permitted the PFH vapor removal. This
paper summarizes characterization and optimization of the system and
its application for the analysis of single bovine blood cells.

Experimental
Section
Materials
SU-8 2002 and SU-8 2050 photoresists were
purchased from Microchem Corp. (Massachusetts, U.S.A.). 1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane
was purchased from ABCR-Chemicals (Karlsruhe, Germany). PDMS and curing
agent (Sylgard 184) were obtained from Dow Corning (Michigan, U.S.A.).
Perfluorohexane, 95+% and 99% (used for the ICPMS tests), were purchased
from Alfa Aesar (Karlsruhe, Germany) and Sigma-Aldrich (Missouri,
U.S.A.), respectively. Merck IV multielement standard solution was
purchased from Merck Millipore (Massachusetts, U.S.A.). The test solutions
were prepared from single-element standard solutions (Inorganic Ventures,
Virginia, U.S.A.) and contained nitrate salts of either Ce or Na,
Mg, Ca, Mn, Fe, Mo (referred as multielement solution) at concentrations
of 1 mg kg–1. Merck IV and the test solutions were
diluted to the required concentrations with 2% sub-boiled HNO3 prepared in ultrahigh-purity water (Merck Millipore, Massachusetts,
U.S.A.).

Cell Preparation and Digestion
Washed pooled bovine/calf
red blood cells in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were obtained from
Rockland Immunochemicals Inc. (Pennsylvania, U.S.A.). Additional PBS
for dilution of the cell suspension was purchased from Life Technologies
(Paisley, U.K.). The concentration of cells was manually determined
using a hemocytometer (five replicates). Three aliquots of 1 mL of
the cell suspension were microwave digested (Ethos Plus, Milestone
Inc., Connecticut, U.S.A.) in 8 mL of 60% sub-boiled HNO3 and 2 mL of 30% H2O2 (TraceSelect, Fluka Analytical,
Buchs SG, Switzerland) adding Co to determine the digestion recovery.
After 5000× dilution of the dissolved cell suspension, the quantification
of Fe was realized by ICPMS using external calibration and Mn as internal
standard. Acid and PBS blanks were monitored in the same way.

Microfluidic
Chip Fabrication
The microfluidic chip
consists of two PDMS pieces that are bonded together. One half is
patterned with the microfluidic channels and the other half is flat
and used to seal the channels. The PDMS was prepared by mixing the
oligomer and the curing agent at a ratio of 10:1. After degassing
the PDMS mixture it was poured into a custom-made casting form placed
on top of a silicon wafer. All details of the master mold fabrication
can be found in the Supporting Information. The casting form has an opening allowing filling with PDMS and
provides the semicircular shape. The chips for use on the microscope
were fabricated in a rectangular shape with an open-top casting form.
The PDMS was cured at 150 °C for 6 min. Holes were punched in
the patterned PDMS half using a 1.5 mm outer diameter biopsy puncher
(Miltex, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.) to form the inlets. The layers were
then bonded together by adhesive bonding using the PDMS curing agent.35 A blank 100 mm carrier wafer was spin-coated
with PDMS curing agent for 30 s at 6000 rpm. Subsequently, the patterned
PDMS half was stamped onto the coated carrier wafer and then manually
aligned on top of the flat PDMS half. After curing for 24 h at room
temperature the tip of the chip was cut off with a utility knife opening
the outlet nozzle. It has a rectangular shape with the dimensions
of approximately 40 μm × 25 μm (Supporting Information Figure S-1). Finally, the microfluidic
channels were silanized by flushing for 20 min with a stream of dry
N2 carrying 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane to achieve
a more robust droplet generation. All steps of the chip fabrication
are shown in detail on the Figures S-2 and S-3 in the Supporting Information. The entire chip design
including all feed lines is shown in Supporting
Information Figure S-4.

Microfluidic Chip Operation
All fluids were supplied
using a neMESYS syringe pump (Cetoni, Korbussen, Germany). The aqueous
sample solutions were added with a 1 mL Primo syringe (Codan, Lensahn,
Germany), at flow rates of 0.3–1 μL min–1. PFH for generation and acceleration of droplets was delivered at
flow rates between 30 and 100 μL min–1 with
5 mL syringes (B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany). Fluids from the syringes
were transferred to the LADE chip using PTFE tubing (PKM SA, Lyss,
Switzerland). After the flows were started, 3–5 min was required
to fill the microfluidic channels with liquid and to stabilize the
droplet generation.

Optical Droplet Measurements
Bright-field
microscopy
was performed on an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope (Tokyo, Japan)
with a Miro M110 high-speed camera (Vision Research, New Jersey, U.S.A.).
The LADE chips for microscopic use were mounted horizontally on a
custom-made microscope insert. This insert holds the chip in place
above a plastic Petri dish, which collected the ejected liquids. The
high-speed recordings were analyzed using the droplet morphometry
and velocimetry software36 to obtain droplet
size and droplet frequency statistics. All images were recorded at
10 000 frames s−1 with an exposure
time of 10 μs. Before each measurement the system was given
at least 3 min to stabilize. The droplet size and frequency for various
flow rates of deionized H2O and PFH were measured twice
for 1 s on two different chips (in total four measurements). The average
of the frequency and droplet size of these four measurements was calculated.
The experiments with deionized H2O, Merck IV solution,
and PBS were performed on three different chips. Each solution was
measured once for 1 s, and the average droplet size and frequency
were calculated.

Droplet Transport System
The setup
of the droplet transport
system is shown in Figure 1. The droplet jet
was ejected vertically into a custom-built adapter made of poly(methyl
methacrylate) (PMMA). A cyclonic gas flow of He supplied through the
adapter transported the droplets further into a vertically arranged
stainless steel tube with 6 mm inner diameter and 50 cm length. A
cartridge heater placed in the middle of the steel tube was used to
accelerate the solvent evaporation and to reduce the total droplet
size permitting its further transport. A poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC)
tubing was used to connect the steel tube with a membrane desolvator
(CETAC6000AT+ (only the desolvator unit), CETAC Technologies,
Nebraska, U.S.A.), whose operating parameters are summarized in Table 1. The dry droplets were introduced into the ICP
after admixing with Ar via a laminar flow adapter to maintain stable
operating conditions within the ICP. Besides the microfluidic chip,
a commercially available microdroplet dispensing system consisting
of a dispenser head, a control unit, and a CCD camera for the droplet
visualization (MD-K-150 with control unit MD-E-201-H, Microdrop Technologies
GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany) was used with the same transport setup
for comparison experiments.

system consists of the LADE chip, a heater, a membrane desolvator,
and an ICPMS.

A commercial quadrupole-based
ICPMS (ELAN6000,
PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, U.S.A.) was employed in this work. Its
operating conditions are summarized in Table 1. The data was read out every 10 ms with 3 ms interval in between,
resulting in the measurement duty cycle of 77%.

Data Evaluation
The MS-signals generated by droplets
were evaluated using OriginPro 8.6 (OriginLab Corp., Massachusetts,
U.S.A.). The signals were plotted as frequency distribution histograms,
which were subsequently fitted with the Gaussian function. The mean
and σ of the fit represented the mean signal intensity and its
standard deviation (SD), respectively. The transport efficiency was
derived
from the total number of droplet events detected per total effective
measurement time (only the dwell time) and the droplet production
frequency. The total number of droplets was estimated summing up all
the transient signals. The intervals for signals produced by one,
two, and more droplets were chosen based on minima of their frequency
distribution histogram.

Results and Discussion
Microfluidic Device
A photograph of the LADE chip is
shown in Figure 2a. It is made entirely of
PDMS by means of standard soft lithography. One part of the chip was
designed to be cylindrical so that it fits tightly into the inlet
of the droplet transport system. To achieve this round shape a custom-made
casting form was produced. The chip is composed of two halves (Figure 2b). Due to the low cost of the material (approximately
$2 per chip) and the fast fabrication time (about 15 min hands on
time per chip, excluding the wafer fabrication) the use of a new chip
for every experiment is feasible, which eliminates cross contamination
and the need for time-consuming cleaning. Furthermore, the fabrication
technique allows for fast changes of the design and the integration
of additional microfluidic components.

LADE chip next to a one Swiss franc coin

visualization. The round part of the chip can be directly inserted
into a socket of the adapter. The rectangular part of the chip contains
the three access holes for sample and PFH introduction. (b) Rendering
of the two components of the LADE chip.

Figure 3a shows a scheme of the key
microfluidic
features of the LADE chip. In the first channel junction, monodisperse
droplets of an aqueous sample solution are generated. The aqueous
phase is segmented by flow focusing using the immiscible and highly
volatile PFH (boiling point 58–60 °C).37 Size and frequency of the droplets can be controlled by
the flow rates of the aqueous phase and the PFH. The second junction
is used to add more PFH in order to increase the flow speed to at
least 1 m s–1, which is necessary for the ejection
of the liquid in a stable and straight jet (Figure 3b and the Supporting Information movie). This double-junction design allows controlling the jet stability
independent from droplet generation, enabling the production of a
broader range of droplet sizes. Furthermore, this concept simplifies
the integration of further microfluidic components. It is also an
advantage that the liquid sample droplets do not get into direct contact
with the nozzle, which prevents clogging of the nozzle by dried residues.
After ejection, the PFH carrier phase breaks into small droplets,
whereas the aqueous droplets remain intact inside a PFH shell (Figure 3c). Fragmentation of the aqueous droplets during
the ejection was not observed under the microscope.

Figure 3 (a) Scheme of droplet
generation and acceleration. In the first
junction monodisperse aqueous droplets are generated in the stream
of PFH. To accelerate the droplets, further PFH is added at the second
junction. Subsequently, the droplet stream exits the LADE chip through
the nozzle. Arrows indicate the direction of the flows for liquid
streams. (b) Micrograph showing the on-chip droplet generation and
acceleration as well as the ejection from the chip. Scale bar 500

System Characterization
The droplet sizes and frequencies
were characterized with a high-speed camera and an automated image-processing
program. The results (shown in Table 2) from
the two chips demonstrate the droplet monodispersity and a low chip-to-chip
variation. The size of the on-chip produced aqueous droplets ranges
from 40 to 60 μm in diameter (30–110 pL). However, the
droplet size range can easily be extended by changing the channel
height or chip design. The influence of the dissolved substance in
the aqueous phase on the droplet generation was insignificant (see
Table 3). This indicates that the system can
potentially be used for various aqueous solutions without the need
for an individual measurement of the frequency and size.

A transient MS-signal
generated by one single droplet is very short
and lasts only a few hundreds of microseconds.38 These signals could not be temporally resolved with the
MS used (10 ms dwell time). The transient signals of single droplets
containing Ce nitrate solution and their frequency distribution histogram
are shown in Figure 4, parts a and b. The double
distribution (not including the first tailing peak) is the result
of a high temporal jitter in droplet arrival at the ICP (>10 ms)
and
unsynchronized signal acquisition. It corresponds to the signal of
one (630 ± 50) or two (1250 ± 70) droplets detected within
the dwell time of 10 ms. Table 4 summarizes
the relative standard deviation (RSD) of signals of single droplets
for several other isotopes measured using a multielement solution
at a concentration of 1 mg kg–1.

Figure 4 (a) Transient signals

nitrate solution and (b) their frequency distribution histogram. The
first and the second fitted peaks correspond to the signals of one
and two droplets acquired within 10 ms dwell time, respectively. The
Gaussian function was fitted to find the mean and SD of the signals.
The droplets were produced using 0.3, 35, and 35 μL min–1 of aqueous solution, generating PFH, and accelerating
PFH, respectively.

a The droplets were produced using
0.5, 50, and 60 μL min–1 of aqueous solution,
generating PFH, and accelerating PFH, respectively.

The signal precision is not only
a function of the variation in
droplet volume but also of the multiplicative noise related to the
transport system and the ICP and of the Poisson noise.39 An additional source leading to a broadening
of the signal distribution is the incomplete signal detection due
to splitting of single-droplet signals between the dwell time (10
ms) and quadrupole settling time (3 ms). This can be eliminated employing
continuous, time-resolved detection.15,40 A signal RSD
as low as 8% was achieved, which is comparable to the RSDs obtained
using the commercially available microdroplet generator system and
indicates high monodispersity of the aqueous droplets generated by
the chip.

The first peak of the intensity distribution histogram
(Figure 4b from 0 to 25 counts/10 ms) cannot
be attributed
to the background only because of its longer tailing in comparison
to the signal measured with the aqueous phase switched off, which
amounted to only 2.8 ± 1.9 counts. The ratio of the mean of this
peak to the mean of the next peak, which is produced by the single
droplets, was element-specific and varied with operating conditions
of the chip and the He gas flow rate. The appearance of the first
peak can be mainly explained by disruption and fragmentation of the
droplets during the transport and, additionally, by washout of a remaining
on the channel walls aqueous solution by PFH plugs, or other memory
effects within the transport system. Further studies are required
to investigate this phenomenon in more detail.

The TE of the
droplets depended strongly on the He gas flow rate
and reached its maximum at ≈65% (Supporting
Information Figure S-5). The 58% maximum TE achieved using
the commercial dispenser, which produced aqueous droplets in the size
of 72.1 ± 0.5 μm at 10 Hz, suggests that the number of
droplets delivered to the ICP is strictly limited by the transport
assembly and not by the chip itself. The temporal jitter of droplets
generated by the microdroplet dispenser was also significantly higher
(>10 ms) than that reported using horizontal and vertical transport
assemblies operated at ambient temperature.19 Only a minor change in the droplet TE was observed varying the flow
rate of the Ar sweep gas (Supporting Information Figure S-5). The current TE and high variation in arrival times
of droplets at the plasma can be improved by optimizing the geometry
of the transport system, shortening the total distance between the
position of droplet ejection and the ICP, and implementing the desolvation
at a very early stage.

To increase the analysis throughput a
discrete sampling strategy
is of an advantage. Similar to the cartridge sampling technique,41 small volumes of different samples can be introduced
into a capillary between PFH plugs which will prevent their intermixing.
A series of droplets of each sample plug produced on the chip can
be sequentially measured. Approximately 0.5 μL of the multielement
solution was measured in this way, and the signal of 56Fe was monitored. The signal distribution histogram is shown in Figure 5. Even such a small liquid aliquot could still be
measured and produced signals with an RSD of 11%. Approximately 8%
of this RSD can be assigned to the contribution from counting statistics.42

Figure 5 Frequency distribution histogram of signals generated
by single
droplets. Approximately 0.5 μL of the multielement solution
was injected. The Gaussian function was fitted to find the mean and
SD of the signals. The droplets were produced using flow rates of
0.5, 40, and 40 μL min–1 of aqueous solution,
generating PFH, and accelerating PFH, respectively.

Cell Analysis
The new system can
be employed for introduction
and subsequent analysis of single biological cells. First, tests were
carried out using 6–7 μm in diameter bovine/calf red
blood cells suspended in PBS. The suspension was diluted in PBS to
a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/mL ensuring that
only 7% of the droplets carry more than 1 cell. The sample was introduced
at a rate of 0.5 μL min–1, and the flow rates
of the PFH generating and accelerating streams were 40 μL min–1. Transient signals generated by single cells and
their frequency distribution histogram are shown in Figure 6, parts a and b. A frequency distribution histogram
of PBS signals without cells can be found in the Supporting Information (Figure S-6). The TE of the cells was
significantly lower (4.5%) than the TE obtained with droplets containing
multielement solution and degraded during the measurement due to the
cell precipitation in the syringe and the capillary. No clogging of
the microfluidic channels by cells after operation was detected under
the optical microscope.

Figure 6 (a) 56Fe+ transient signals
generated by
single red blood cells and (b) their frequency distribution histogram.
The droplets were produced using flow rates of 0.5, 40, and 40 μL
min–1 of aqueous solution, generating PFH, and accelerating
PFH, respectively.

The size of the red blood
cells is larger than the size of the
completely desolvated salt particle, which would be ≈1 μm
for a 50 μm droplet generated from a 1 mg kg–1 multielement solution used in this work. Additionally, the high
salt content of the PBS will result in an even larger residue of the
droplet carrying the cell after liquid evaporation. Therefore, the
low TE is most likely a result of losses in the transport assembly,
whose length was relatively long and should be further optimized specifically
for applications involving cells. Nevertheless, the RSD of the 56Fe+ signals produced by single cells from the
detected cell population amounted to 23% (Figure 6b).

The average number of Fe atoms/cell of 5.3 ±
1.2 × 108 was determined based on calibration of the
instrument with
droplets consisting of the multielement solution. The cells and the
standard solution were measured using two different chips. The mean
signal intensity of the first background peak was subtracted from
the mean signal generated by the single cells. The means were determined
by fitting the distribution histograms with the Gaussian function.
The first peak originates mostly from the ArO+ polyatomic
species interfering on the measured mass-to-charge ratio (m/Q); however, the contribution of Fe released
from the cells to its tailing cannot be excluded. Employing the non-matrix-matched
standard, the content of Fe per
cell was underestimated by 25% compared to 6.2 ± 0.6 × 108 atoms/cell calculated from the cell concentration and bulk
concentration of Fe. This underestimation can be caused by incomplete
vaporization of droplets residues carrying cells in the plasma43 or by cell hemolysis.

It has already been
demonstrated that the element content of individual
cells can be quantitatively determined using calibration with solid
particles44 and monodisperse aerosols.45 Recently, monodisperse microdroplets consisting
of an inorganic salt standard solution were utilized for quantitative
mass determination of single metallic nanoparticles.19 This approach can be directly transferred to the quantification
of naturally occurring or exogenous elements in single cells and quantification
of the proteins after chemical and biospecific labeling.46 The recent developments in metal-based labeling
of the cell proteome47 and in the field
of mass cytometry48 have enabled multiplexing
in the single-cell analysis and extended the use of the ICPMS to cell
biology. The single-droplet-based calibration approach can expand
the capabilities of the mass cytometry toward the absolute protein
quantification in the cell, provided the labeling can be performed
quantitatively. The results obtained with the microfluidic system
demonstrate its potential toward quantitative metallomics and proteomics
in bulk or on the single-cell basis. For a more accurate quantification,
the system can be further modified in the way that the sample and
standard can be introduced from the same chip in parallel or sequentially.

Conclusions
A novel droplet microfluidics-based sample introduction
system
for the ICPMS analysis of micro samples is described. The droplets
generated in the microfluidic chip are highly monodisperse and can
be produced in the size range from 40 to 60 μm. This size range,
however, can be further extended by modifications of the microfluidic
channels. The aqueous droplets ejected from the chip in the stream
of PFH remain intact and can be transported into the ICPMS via a custom-built
transport system with >50% efficiency. The ongoing work in our
lab
is currently focused on the improvement of this system to achieve
complete and more stable sample transport. The proposed sample introduction
system demonstrated its potential for the analysis of liquid volumes
of <1 μL and for the quantitative elemental analysis of single
cells. In this respect, the development of a chip capable of generating
the droplets of sample and standard sequentially or in parallel49 would be highly beneficial for the accurate
quantification. In addition, the integration of a multichannel sample
introduction can potentially be used for the internal standardization
or to increase the measurement throughput by running more than one
sample in parallel. This parallel approach will be valid only if isotope
signatures of the samples are different. Furthermore, such an approach
would require a simultaneous mass spectrometer. This new introduction
technique has also a potential for the integration of further microfluidic
modules for sample pretreatment, e.g., separation,50−52 dilution,53−55 fast mixing,56 chemical reactions,57 or cell sorting.58,59 In addition,
cells encapsulated inside the droplets can be lysed to reduce the
volume of the cell residua and to possibly improve their transport
efficiency.
