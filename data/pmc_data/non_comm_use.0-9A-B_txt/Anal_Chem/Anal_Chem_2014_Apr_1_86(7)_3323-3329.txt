Analysis of the chemical composition
of surfaces by liquid sampling
devices interfaced to mass spectrometry is attractive as the sample
stream can be continuously monitored at good sensitivity and selectivity.
A sampling probe has been constructed that takes discrete liquid samples
(typically <100 nL) of a surface. It incorporates an electrostatic
lens system, comprising three electrodes, to which static and pulsed
voltages are applied to form a conical “liquid tip”,
employed to dissolve analytes at a surface. A prototype system demonstrates
spatial resolution of 0.093 mm2. Time of contact between
the liquid tip and the surface is controlled to standardize extraction.
Calibration graphs of different analyte concentrations on a stainless
surface have been measured, together with the probe’s reproducibility,
carryover, and recovery. A leucine enkephalin-coated surface demonstrated
good linearity (R2 = 0.9936), with a recovery
of 90% and a limit of detection of 38 fmol per single spot sampled.
The probe is compact and can be fitted into automated sample analysis
equipment having potential for rapid analysis of surfaces at a good
spatial resolution.

==== Body
Analysis
of surfaces has exploited
mass spectrometry as a versatile detection system for many years.
Extractive sampling of surfaces by direct contact of a liquid interfaced
to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)1−3 is highly attractive as it can provide continuous monitoring and
potentially high sensitivity for targeted compounds. Further downstream
chromatographic separation could be applied to complex samples. A
common hurdle for liquid sampling is the size of the contact face
and lack of control of the liquid meniscus, this device has the potential
to overcome these limitations and allow automated operation. This
study examines an electro-focusing system to control droplet contact
size and time of contact. The generic method demonstrated could be
further improved and miniaturized through precision engineered electrode/probe
assemblies.

The past decade has witnessed the invention of numerous
methods
to achieve ambient sampling/ionization,4 significantly Cooks et al. invented desorption electrospray ionization
(DESI)5 for surface analysis. Neutral desorption
sampling of surfaces, a variant of DESI, employing a hot gas stream
was implemented by Chen and Zenobi in 2007.6 Laskin et al. devised a nano-DESI system offering high sensitivity,
good spatial resolution and with imaging capability.7 On the other hand, microfluidics has been applied to the
analysis of surfaces by the contact of a liquid stream or droplet,
from an appropriate device, that is resampled and taken to a detector.
Digital microfluidics (DMF) is an emerging sample preparation for
mass spectrometry.8

In 2004, Luftmann
described a simple device for sampling TLC spots
directly to ESI-MS with an inlet and outlet solvent flow using a circular
cutting edge to define a spot.9 Van Berkel’s
group has published a number of strategies for direct liquid sampling
of surfaces10−17 and constructed liquid microjunction surface sampling probes, one
having a contact face of ≈635 μm in diameter.11 Operating at a flow rate of 15 μL/min
with an aqueous/methanol mixture, it was assessed to have quantitative
capability, a limit of detection (LOD) of 50 ng/mL by selected reaction
monitoring (SRM), for drugs in dried blood spots and thin tissue sections.10 Chip-based infusion nanospray ionization system
has been described as liquid extractive surface analysis (LESA).2 Walworth et al. stated a lower limit of detection
(LLOD) of 0.1 ng for propranolol using LESA with SRM detection, with
extraction efficiencies of up to 77% reported for samples on a stainless
steel plate.18

The above cited research
represents a considerable body of work
for the analysis of surfaces at atmospheric conditions. Compatibility
of a sampling device to suit the characteristics of ESI-MS led us
to the development of an EF-LESA probe to achieve enhanced spatial
resolution of a contact liquid microjunction. The device incorporates
an electrostatic lens system, shown schematically in Figure 1, that can shape the droplet at the end of the probe,
sharpening it to a conical tip. The underlying concept for the EF-LESA
probe was adapted from a micro droplet system of Yogi et al.19,20 They developed a trielectrode lens system for improving the positioning
of a picoliters droplet dispensing system, with a 1 μm precision,
using pulsed voltages applied to its electrodes. We also observed
that a trielectrode system can shape sessile droplets that can be
resampled by discrete sampling or direct infusion ESI-MS. An important
aspect of the design is the applied voltage to deform the liquid surface
to a conical tip; it is significantly lower than the onset voltage
for electrospray, Von(21) (see eq 1.1 below), allowing EF-LESA
to form a stable liquid tip for enhanced liquid sampling.

The
shape of a sessile droplet at the end of a capillary tip transforms
when a voltage is applied; the liquid menisci formed with increasing
applied voltage have been classified by Cloupeau and Prunet-Foch.22 Jaworck and Krupa have further detailed the
classification of electrohydrodynamic (EHD) spraying modes on the
size and charge of droplets generated.23 In order of increasing voltage, the modes are described as dripping,
spindle, oscillating jet, precession, and cone-jet mode. The spindle
mode is the lowest voltage EHD mode that can form liquid tips and
is employed in this study. The temporal progression that spindle-mode
liquid tip shapes take on has been classified.24 A near conical-shaped tip forms at the apex, with a proboscis-like
spindle forming prior to its ultimate breakdown with the formation
of droplets. Theoretical descriptions of the fluid dynamics of “Taylor
cones” has recently been reviewed by de la Mora25 and for electrospray by Kebarle and Verkerk.21 These theories have been applied to pure liquids,
from low conductivities to charged liquids. Most theories to our knowledge
require a flow of liquid to describe dynamic behavior. Liquid flow
through the EF-LESA probe into the tip is stopped, at the time of
sampling, however, a transient local flow exists within the liquid
tip as it reshapes from a sessile droplet to a conical liquid tip
under the influence of an applied electric field, prior to contact
with the surface. These conditions applied to EF-LESA prevent electrospray
initiation and confine liquid contact to a small region on the surface.

While the present implementation is a single sampling device demonstrating
proof of principle, we intend to further develop EF-LESA to allow
continuous mobile phase flow through the liquid tip, for online MS
operation. In this case, the EF-LESA liquid tip will be formed by
automated control of a pulsed electric field. No studies are reported
in the literature for a sampling system operating in the “spindle
mode” domain. While there is significant literature for pulsed-mode
droplet spraying25,26 and pulsed-mode electrospray,27−30 these have been demonstrated as spraying devices (not sampling)
on a range of liquids and conductivities. Our approach could be adopted
to operate as a pulsed sampling probe where the liquid tip contacts
a surface at a point in a periodic fashion, providing higher spatial
resolution than an equivalent liquid junction micro sampling system.

Preliminary research was conducted to find optimum voltages for
the three electrodes of the EF-LESA system and the position of the
probe tip relative to the surface. Early prototypes showed there was
a need for a precision-engineered probe to achieve reproducible liquid
tips; the prototype used in this investigation is based upon a plastic
engineered dispensing tip (refer to Experimental
Section for details). The system has been tested with a stainless
steel surface and coated with analyte over a range of concentrations.
Calibration graphs of analyte concentration were measured for leucine
enkephalin (LE) and angiotensin II (AT),
both using an internal standard of N-acetylarginine
(NAA). The reproducibility, carryover, and recovery of
the device were measured as part of the characterization study of
EF-LESA.

Experimental Section
Chemical Reagents
Leucine enkephalin,
angiotensin II,
and N-acetylarginine were purchased from Fisher Scientific
U.K. Ltd. (Loughborough, U.K.). Individual stock solutions (LE, 180 pmol/μL; AT, 956 pmol/μL;
and NAA, 920 pmol/μL were prepared in a solvent
mixture A, consisting of pure water). Compounds were chosen because
they were soluble in H2O and provide a good ESI response.
Solutions used in experiments and for construction of the calibration
graphs were prepared at the desired concentration by serial dilution
in water from the stock solution with further dilution, after surface
sampling, with 50:50 water (with 0.1% formic acid):methanol solution
(solvent mixture B). A solvent mixture of water with 0.1% formic acid
was used as the EF-LESA probe mixture (solvent mixture C). HPLC-grade
methanol and water were purchased from Fisher Scientific U.K. Ltd.,
and formic acid was supplied by Sigma Aldrich Ltd. (Gillingham, Dorset,
U.K.).

between the probe and the sample plate; ht, height of the conical liquid tip during formation; wn, diameter of the neck of the liquid tip and wc, the diameter at contact; woa and hsa are the diameter
and height of the residual droplet on the probe, and wr and hr are the diameter
and height of the residual drop on the sampling plate.

Design of the EF-LESA Probe Apparatus
A generic design
for an EF-LESA probe is shown schematically in Figure 1A, it comprises an insulated capillary tube (T, a commercially
sourced plastic tip) and three metal electrodes E1, E2, and E3 to which DC voltages V1, V2, and V3 are applied, respectively. Electrode E1 is
contained within the insulating tube, T, and positioned at a height, hi, from the tube end. There are many possible
designs for electrode E1, both a solid metal rod and metal
capillary tube were tested allowing probe liquid to be dispensed either
within electrode E1 or around it. (Figure 1A shows an annular gap between E1 and T, although
this gap is closed in the prototype used.) An outer electrode, E2, is in contact and positioned flush with the end of the insulating
tube, T. The surface to be studied is placed on the third electrode,
E3; it is a removable stainless steel coverslip (10 ×
75 × 1 mm) retained in a guide channel milled into the base.
Electrode E3 is rotatable about a central axis, and the
coverslip can be moved laterally. A USB camera (fixed magnification
of ×20; model Discovery VMS-001, Veho Europe, Southampton, U.K.)
was mounted opposite the probe to capture frames or video. For the
experiments reported below the probe mixture (solvent mixture C) was
delivered by a 500 μL syringe (Unimetrics Corp, Illinois). The
liquid entering the probe tip was contained within a sealed system
so that probe liquid would not siphon during liquid tip formation.
The surface to be sampled might be a thin nonconducting or a dielectric
material, although we did not investigate this. The underlying surface,
however, needs to be sufficiently conducted so as to support an electric
field that drives tip information.

All results reported were
obtained using a commercially available plastic tip (part no 1004763,
Advion Inc., Itacha, NY), with a syringe needle acting as an inner
electrode, E1. The outer electrode E2 was made
by carefully applying a thin coat of silver-loaded electrically conductive
paint (part no. 186-3600, RS Components Ltd., Northants, U.K.) to
the lower 15 mm portion of the plastic tip and the end face of the
tip. A fine wire was employed during coating to clear and prevent
silver glue entering the tip. Silvered tips were made in batches and
dried overnight in a vacuum oven at room temperature under a vacuum
of <10–2 Torr. Due to the size of the syringe
needle and the internal diameter (i.d.) of the plastic tip, the electrode
E1 had to be set at hi = 4
mm (Figure 1A). Additionally, the device operated
sufficiently well with V1 ≈ V2 that E1 was electrically connected
to E2 for all experiments. The gap between the probe was
set at hg = 0.50 mm and the initial droplet
depth (hs) set at 0.30 mm throughout.
This allowed consistent liquid tips of width, wc ≈ 0.34 mm, to be formed in all experiments.

Procedure
for Sampling
A manual process was employed
for sampling the surface as follows. The stainless steel coverslip
was cleaned with distilled water followed by a MeOH wash. The analyte
was pipetted as a 1 μL volume of working solution. A grid had
been marked on the coverslip and used to note the positions where
1 μL analyte solutions were pipetted and allowed to dry to solid
residues typically covering a spot of ≈2 mm diameter. Photographic
recording of the size of the region coated by the analyte and knowledge
of the tip contact position and size, formed at sampling, allowed
an estimate of the fractional area sampled. The probe tip was positioned
so that the sample was taken within the region spotted by the analyte.
Individual photographs were taken of liquid tips to estimate the contact
area, the type of liquid tip formed, and the contact width (wc) before and after a liquid probe tip broke
leaving a residue droplet of width (wr). The coverslip with analyte spotted on its surface was inserted
into the base electrode, E3 assembly. Each individual analyte
spot was positioned directly under the EF-LESA probe and sampled as
follows: (i) voltages V1, V2, and V3 were initially set
to zero. A sessile droplet was formed on the EF-LESA probe tip by
syringing solution C, through the central electrode, to a depth of hs = 0.30 mm. This dimension was monitored and
recorded using the USB camera against a ruled scale to an estimated
accuracy of ±0.05 mm. The pipetted volume was estimated, from
the on-screen display of the droplet dimensions and shape, to be ≈100
nL. The probe assembly was checked for leaks so that that liquid tip
did not hydraulically draw liquid down through the tube, T. (ii) Voltage
V3 was switched from 0 to −500 V. (iii) VoltageV1 (=V2) was slowly
increased from 0 to +350 and then to +700 V (over 2 s). Typically V1 = +440 V was required for the formation of
the desired liquid tip (Figure 1B). (iv) The
liquid tip was left in contact with the surface for 5 s prior to the
probe assembly being retracted mechanically from the surface; that
is, hg was increased so that the liquid
tip reproducibly retracted from the surface and broke in ≈2
s. (v) The probe was further retracted so that the residual sessile
volume retained on the probe was extracted by manually syringing into
a separate 50 μL syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV) with 3 μL
of solution B already in the syringe, to make up a volume of ≈3.1
μL. This procedure was followed to clearly distinguish the plunger
extracting the sample into the syringe. The fractional amount (Fs) injected into the MS is 2/3.1 (i.e., 64.5%
of that extracted by the probe). (vi) The top 2 μL of the volume
was then directly injected using a 2 μL loop into the injector
for SIM analysis. (vii) The probe was cleaned using washing method
A outlined below. The probe tip could not be washed with a high content
of organic solvent (e.g., methanol), as it was observed to erode and
dissolve the silver coating on prolonged use.

Procedure for Washing the
Probe and Coverslip
Washing Method A
The probe was cleaned
by eluting 15
μL of probe solvent C to a blank section of the coverslip and
the probe tip was immersed in the resulting droplet for 1–2
s prior to removal. This was repeated three times.

Washing Method
B
The coverslip was cleaned after removal
by flooding the surface with water and then methanol. The plate was
dried with a lint free wipe and allowed to evaporate to dryness. This was repeated three times.

Mass Spectrometry
Accurate mass data were obtained
in selected ion mode (SIM) on a Thermo Scientific LTQ Orbitrap XL
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Gmbh, Bremen, Germany). A window of m/z ± 1 was selected for SIM mode
and centered on the target protonated molecule species, [M + nH]n+. Samples were injected
via a Rheodyne (Idex Health and Science Gmbh, Wertheim-Modfeld, Germany)
6 port valve with a 2 μL loop and infused into the IonMax electrospray
ionization (ESI) source operating with a 10 μL/min mobile phase
flow of 50:50 water/methanol with 0.1% formic acid (solution B). The
ESI source was operated in the positive ion mode with a spray voltage
of +3.5 kV, nitrogen nebulizer gas flow of 10 (arbitrary units) indicated
in Xcalibur (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a capillary temperature
of 275 °C. The Orbitrap was operated at a mass resolution of
60000 (50% peak height definition at m/z 400) and mass measurement accuracy of ≈2 ppm (RMS). SIM spectra
were recorded over approximately 2.4 to 3 s per scan. In our infusion
setup, the SIM chromatograph had a peak width, at base, of approximately
30 to 40 s, corresponding to 10 to 15 scans per injection, sufficient
for quantitation.

Safety Considerations
Exposed DC
high voltages were
present at the EF-LESA tip and on the surface sampling plate. The
apparatus was insulated with appropriately machined PTFE parts to
shroud high voltage components. Extreme care was employed to prevent
electrical shock with the use of electrical isolation and earthing.
Voltage sources were fitted with current limiting 108 ohm
blocking resistors to reduce risk and potential of electrical discharge.
Full risk assessment was undertaken for the project prior to commencement.
Material safety sheets for all chemicals employed were consulted in
advance of performing experiments.

Results and Discussion
Early studies involved evaluating prototype assemblies made in
our workshop. Glass capillary tubing was initially used for the inner
insulated tube, T, and various solid metal rods and tubes tested as
a central electrode, E1 (refer to Figure 1A). Liquid was fed by syringe pump operated manually to the
probe tip with liquid passing around electrode E1 or through
the electrode, when a hollow tube was used. The tubing diameters of
the inner electrode and insulated tube were chosen in the earliest
prototypes to ensure liquid flow to the tip (i.e., DE1 < Dit) (Figure 1). These preliminary studies showed that electro-focusing
of the sessile droplet meniscus was feasible with a trielectrode lens,
and different dimensions for the electrode configuration were examined.
Due to the home-built nature of the probe, we experienced difficulty
with reproducibility and control of the liquid tip and opted to use
an engineered plastic tip that gave good performance and stability
of operation. Probe liquid was dispensed through the central electrode
(syringe needle), which was a push fit sealed into the plastic tip.
While this method employs off-line sampling of the liquid retained
on the probe, it is expected that similar results could be obtained
with a probe engineered to return the sample directly into the mass
spectrometer, although carry over is likely to be more important.
In this study, we mechanically rupture the liquid bridge supporting
the liquid tip in contact with the surface by moving the probe a fraction
of a millimeter, prior to sampling the collapsed liquid tip, and transferring
the residual liquid to the MS.

Experimental results including
analytical figures of merit have
been established for the EF-LESA probe’s quantitative capability,
limit of detection, recovery, and carry over (Table 1).

Liquid Tip
Characterization
The liquid tip formed prior
to the initiation of EHD spraying is a dynamic structure that can
take on a number of shapes.22−25 Theoretical studies typically describe the characteristics
of liquid droplet formation22,23,25 or electrospray.21,31 de la Mora’s review25 lays out the theory of “Taylor cone”
formation, describing the balance between capillary and electrostatic
forces, which are satisfied exactly on the liquid surface. The pressure
differential, Δp, at the surface drives cone
tip formation. In the special case of the Taylor cone the cone angle
is (49.3°), for Δp = 0, and separates
a family of menisci shapes both at Δp <
0 and Δp > 0. de la Mora states that “Rather
than describing one Taylor cone structure, one should strive to describe
a family of them”, and describes regions of applied voltage
where stable shapes exist, “one rounded” and the other
“conical”.25

Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of a sessile droplet
forming a conical liquid tip, followed by contact with a surface,
and finally detachment from the surface. These are four distinct phases
of a single EF-LESA sampling event. The geometry of the EF-LESA device
(Figure 1) employed was tip diameter, Dop = 0.85 mm, electrode gap, hg = 0.50 mm, and sessile droplet height (depth) of hs = 0.30 mm. Experimentally liquid tip formation
was initiated at a voltage Vtf = +850
V to +1200 V, Vtf = (V2 – V3), comprising V2 ≈ +350 to +700 V (variable) and V3 = −500 V (fixed). The average value
for Vtf was (940 ± 52) V (refer to
the Supporting Information).

The
voltage for the onset of electrospray, Von, is defined as21 1.1  where γ = surface tension, εo = permittivity
of vacuum, and θ = 49.3°, hg, and Dop are given
above. Water with 0.1% formic acid was used in the EF-LESA probe as
the mobile phase, assuming γ = 0.73 N m–1 (i.e.,
water) and then Von = +1725 V. The experimental
value of Vtf for liquid tip formation
was consistently measured to be in the range from (+850 to +1200 V),
deviations from approximately +940 V were due to variation in setting, hs. This establishes Vtf ≪ Von, demonstrating that a lower
voltage mode, most likely to be spindle mode, is formed. The outer
diameter, DE1 of the central electrode
E1 was chosen to be slightly greater than the inner diameter
of the plastic tip Dit (i.e., DE1 ≤ Dit),
thus sealing the flow of liquid through the probe. In this case, a
sessile droplet is preloaded by dispensing the liquid through the
central electrode, E1. The volume of liquid in the sessile
droplet (Vg) will be equal to the volume
in the conical tip (Vc) (refer to Figure 1, panels A and B), and it is shown (in Supporting Information) that the height of the
conical tip, ht is 1.2  where ht = 0.518
mm, hs = 0.30 mm, and Dop = 0.85 mm. Thus the liquid tip will just touch the
surface prior to the tip reaching its full conical extent. Once the
liquid tip touches the surface, it spreads to a contact face of diameter, wc, and subsequently collapses (retracts) to
a sessile droplet on the tip of diameter woa and height hsa, with a residue droplet
on the surface of diameter wr and height hr (refer to Figure 1C).

Feasibility of routine operation depends upon the ability to reproducibly
form liquid tips of suitable shape, stability of position, transfer
of surface analytes to the probe liquid, and consistency of time-in-contact.
Van Berkel et al. studies report transfer efficiencies to a liquid
microjunction probe in the range from 77% to 1%(18), indicating that surface sampling efficiency varies
considerably dependent on many parameters, including the type of sample,
its solubility, and contact time.

Repeated measurements of liquid
tip formation with a EF-LESA probe
(with hs = 0.30 mm, hg = 0.50 mm, and solvent C as probe liquid) demonstrated
that consistent liquid tips can be formed. The measured average size
of the liquid tip was w̅n = (0.322 ± 0.080) mm, at the neck, and w̅c = (0.344 ± 0.078) mm at contact
(from 28 successive measurements, refer to Table S1A in the Supporting Information). Figure 1C (inset) shows a well-formed liquid tip in contact with a
surface, with a spindle tip diameter of ≈200 μm. The
liquid tip size when no electro-focusing is applied (i.e., V1 = V2 = V3 = 0) was measured to be w̅n = (0.650 ± 0.035) mm and w̅c = (0.660 ± 0.032)
mm (refer to Table S1B of the Supporting Information). In this case, the probe was lowered to a point where the sessile
droplet just touched and wetted the surface. The area of the liquid
tip, at contact, is approximately circular and with quoted width, wc (at contact) and of the residue droplet, wr are estimated diameters of equivalent circular
spots. Characterization results, summarized in Table 1, indicate that the EF-LESA probe enhances the spatial resolution
of surface sampling by a factor of four or a factor of eight based
on the plastic tip diameter (wc ≈ Dop).

The size of the residue droplet on
the coverslip, immediately after
sampling, was measured for successive sampling events. The mean values
of the residue droplet width were w̅r = 0.34 mm and height, h̅r = 0.12 mm corresponding to an average surface
area, Ar = 0.096 ± 0.049 mm2 (1 s.d.) and an average residual volume, Vr = 22 ± 13 nL (1 s.d.) (refer to Table S2 of the Supporting Information). In order to assess the
limit of detection (LOD) per sampling event and recovery from the
surface, the concentration of the coatings per unit area were estimated
from the average area of coating, As,
and the standard line concentration used (Table 1). Small but significant differences in the measured coating area
were found, and dependent on the analyte used and its concentration,
different analytes were observed to wet slightly differently. Nevertheless,
these coatings were tested to assess quantitation. The area sampled
(As) and the area analyte coated (Ad) and the recovery (R) were
statistically measured, allowing the amount of analyte sampled to
be calculated. Additionally, the fact that only 64.5% of analyte collected
by syringe from the tip was injected into the MS had to be included
in the calculations.

Estimation of EF-LESA Cross-Sectional Area
Sampled and Recovery
To determine the recovery and LOD from
a surface, the average surface
area coated (Ad) had to be determined
from depositing individual 1 μL pipet droplets for both analyte
solutions and was estimated from images of the initial spot size.
This estimation process assumes the analyte is evenly coated, which
is unlikely; replicate and random sampling over the analyte spot will
help to average out such effects. For 1 μL of pipet drops of
(LE + IS) and (AT + IS) analyte solutions on the stainless steel coverslip, it was found
that Ad = 2.30 ± 0.20 mm2 and Ad = 3.16 ± 0.50 mm2 (1 s.d.), respectively (see Table S3 of the Supporting Information). These results were reproducible with AT coverage being 39% greater than LE due to
changed wetting properties of the solution.

The fractional amount
(Fs) of the coated area (Ad) sampled is 1.3  and is 4.0% for LE + IS and 2.9% for AT.

As a separate test of recovery, a 14.4 pmol/μL
sample of LE was spotted (1 μL) in triplicate.
Each spot was sampled
five times without washing the probe tip and without a change in its
physical position or movement of the coverslip. These results shown
in Table 1 were compared to a loop injection
of 0.37 pmol LE solution (i.e., amount of analyte deposited
per spot) × Fs × Fv pmol, which is
a 100% recovery (see Supporting Information for full details). The % recovery was measured from the average
of the three replicates, and for the first sampling was calculated
to be 89.5% (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information). After five successive “samplings” of the same spot,
the analyte signal reduced by a factor of 14 for LE.

Figure 2 Calibration
graphs for Leucine Enkephalin (LE) and
Angiotension II (AT). Data to construct the graphs are
given in Table 1. The line fit for both graphs
are shown in the figure and have corresponding R2 values of 0.9936 and 0.9862 for LE and AT, respectively. SIM mass spectra and elemental composition
assignments are inserted. Elemental formula search criteria are as
follows: (A) leucine enkephalin: C30, H60, O15, N10 and (B) angiotensin II: C60,
H100, O15, N15. Note: the results
reported are those < 3 ppm and for protonated species only. Concentrations
quoted are not accounting for partial injection volume (64.5%) and
the surface area sampled.

100% recovery is an analyte signal = (amount of analyte on
a spot)
× Fs × Fv pmol directly infused in the MS. This is equivalent to 100%
recovery from sampling a 1 μL pipetted spot, where Fs is the fractional area sampled (4% for LE) and Fv is the fractional volume (=0.645)
injected into the MS from the sample collected from the EF-LESA probe
tip. For LE, 100% recovery is the mass spectrometer signal
equivalent to 14.4 × 0.042 × 0.645 = 0.37 pmol directly
infused.

Quantitation Using the EF-LESA Probe
An evaluation
of the quantitative behavior of the EF-LESA probe was assessed for
two biochemical compounds; leucine enkephalin (LE) and
angiotensin II (AT) with N-acetylarginine
(NAA) as an internal standard (IS). The
linearity and LOD of the method was measured with calibration graphs
(Figure 2, panels A and B), also showing SIM
spectra and mass measurement data of the protonated species. LODs
were 1.45 and 26.4 pmol/μL spotted for LE and AT, calculated from 3× standard error of the blank. Calibration
graphs were measured at five nonzero concentrations with a matrix
blank, So, and solvent blank, Sb, to ensure the reagent used for the calibration
solvents was analyte free and to test for potential carry over and/or
contamination of the coverslip sample plate prior to sampling standards.
Three repeat measurements were made at each standard concentration,
and the probe was washed after each sampling by cleaning method A
to limit carry over. Each concentration level (including Sb and So) was pipetted onto
the stainless steel coverslip. Between concentration levels, the coverslip
was removed and washed using cleaning method B; calibration was built
from low to high concentration. Between each individual SIM scan,
the injector was washed with 20 μL of solvent B, with 2 μL
of blank (solvent B) injected and monitored by a SIM scan for the
protonated analyte and IS as a check that no analyte
and IS remained. The results show pleasing limits of
quantitation demonstrating promise of the EF-LESA technique for quantitative
surface sampling. Calibration graph linearity, R2 for LE + IS and AT + IS were 0.9936 and 0.9862, respectively.

Use
of the internal standard is important for quantitation as the area
sampled during each liquid tip contact depends on the area wetted
during that sampling event, the transfer of analyte to the probe,
and residue on the probe tip. Using the fractional area sampled (Fs) (eq 1.3), the LOD can
be estimated from 1.4  where LOD is derived for each calibration
graph (Figure 2), Fs is the fractional surface area sampled, and Fv (= 0.645) is the partial injection volume into the MS of
the collected sample. Thus the effective LOD per sampling event is
estimated to be 38 fmol for LE and 494 fmol for AT.

Carry Over
Carry over was examined
by spotting a coverslip
with three replicate spots of LE (concentration = 0.9
pmol/μL) containing IS and five Sb spots in triplicate. An LE spot was sampled
first, then n individual Sb spots until extinction of the LE (and IS). This was repeated on two remaining replicate (and nSb) spots, with a method A wash
of the probe tip between each batch of LE spots to thoroughly
clean the tip (the procedure is given in Supporting
Information). Carry
over for both LE and NAA is given in Table 1, for LE the signal fall off from 100%
(initial analyte sample) is to 10.7%, 1.3%, 0.3%, 0.3%, and 0.3% and
is an exponential decay (refer to Figure S2 of the Supporting Information).

Conclusions
A
liquid sampling device has been designed and tested as a method
for analytically sampling a surface at higher spatial resolution than
is currently offered by a similar diameter liquid micro junction device.
It has been demonstrated to operate as a single event liquid sampling
device. This trielectrode system can shape the liquid meniscus, and
its geometry has been optimized. For leucine enkephalin, an effective
LOD per spot sampled is 38 fmol. A surface recovery of 90% and a carryover
of 10.7% both for a 14.4 pmol/μL solution was demonstrated for
a coated stainless steel surface. Calibration graphs for two analytes
(R2 = 0.9936 and 0.9862) showed good promise
for quantitative operation. Operation of an EF-LESA probe over a few
days showed improving performance with more consistent and reproducible
liquid tips (30–200 μm) being formed (refer to the Supporting Information). Further work will require
new designs of engineered plastic tips to enable continuous flow operation
and control of liquid tip formation by a voltage pulse sequence to
the electro-focusing electrodes. These modifications could lead to
enhancements and an automated sampling–analysis system coupled
to MS, using aqueous media.
