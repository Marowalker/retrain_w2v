Fluorescence
correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is a sensitive technique
commonly applied for studying the dynamics of nanoscale-labeled objects
in solution. Current analysis of FCS data is largely based on the
assumption that the labeled objects are stochastically displaced due
to Brownian motion. However, this assumption is often invalid for
microscale objects, since the motion of these objects is dominated
by Stokes drag and settling or rising effects, rather than stochastic
Brownian motion. To utilize the power of FCS for systems with nonstochastic
displacements of objects, the collection and analysis of FCS data
have to be reconceptualized. Here, we extended the applicability of
FCS for the detection and analysis of periodically passing objects.
Toward this end, we implemented droplet-based microfluidics, in which
monodispersed droplets containing fluorescent marker are flowing equally
spaced within microchannels. We show by simulations and experiments
that FCS can sensitively quantify the flow-rates, variability, and
content of rapidly passing droplets. This information can be derived
at high temporal resolution, based on the intensity fluctuations generated
by only 5–10 passing droplets. Moreover, by utilizing the periodicity
of the flowing droplets for noise reduction by averaging, FCS can
monitor accurately the droplets flow even if their fluorescence intensity
is negligible. Hence, extending FCS for periodically passing objects
converts it into a powerful analytical tool for high-throughput droplet-based
microfluidics. Moreover, based on the principles described here, FCS
can be straightforwardly applied for a variety of systems in which
the passing of objects is periodic rather than stochastic.

Fluorescence
correlation spectroscopy
(FCS) derives information from the temporal fluctuations of fluorescence
intensity.1−5 By sensitive high-rate sampling, typically >10 MHz, FCS records
the intensity fluctuations generated by labeled particles passing
through an observed confocal volume within the sample. The fundamental
analysis of FCS data is the autocorrelation function G(τ)—calculated
as the correlation of the recorded intensity trace with a delayed
copy of itself as a function of the delay, τ.1 FCS is commonly applied for studying nanoscale objects
(e.g., small molecules,6 proteins,1 quantum dots,7 and
liposomes8) passing the observed volume
stochastically due to diffusion and flow.1,5,9 Accordingly, the interpretations of G(τ)
relies largely on the assumption that the labeled particles are been
stochastically displaced due to Brownian motion.10 Such stochasticity implies that the number of particles
present in the confocal volume at the different time points distributes
in a Poisson manner. Since for a Poisson distribution the variance
is equal to the mean, the concentration of the labeled particles can
be inferred from the amplitude of the autocorrelation. Additionally,
the stochastic particles displacement implies that G(τ) decays
as a function of τ, gradually approaching a baseline corresponding
to zero correlation. The decay of G(τ) reflects the gradual
and independent entry and exit of labeled particles in the observed
volume. Accordingly, from this decay, the mobility mechanism of the
particles and its parameters, such as diffusion and flow speeds, can
be inferred. However, while these implications are based on the stochastic
displacements of nanoscale objects in solution, a large variety of
fluid dynamic processes involve motion of microscale objects. For
microscale objects, Brownian motion is much less prominent, while
nonstochastic displacement mechanisms dominated by Stokes drag in
a laminar flow and gravity are more prevailing. Moreover, acoustic
waves and electromagnetic fields can affect the displacements of microscale
objects nonstochastically and arrange them in spatial patterns. To
extend the applicability of FCS for such nonstochastic systems, its
analysis has to be reconceptualized.

One type of nonstochastic
displacements is a constant flow of equally
spaced objects. Such a flow mode is typical in droplet-based microfluidics.
This technology generates via microchannels picoliter-scale monodisperse
emulsion droplets at rates ranging from a slow drip to over 1 MHz.11−15 The detection of droplets and their content is based mainly on fluorescence,
due to the relatively high sampling rate and sensitivity of photodetectors.
Conventionally, this detection relies on identifying the single droplets
along the trace by segmentation using intensity threshold and/or other
object-recognition criteria.16−19 This makes the monitoring of droplets dependent on
assumptions, manual tuning of parameters, and dedicated segmentation
algorithms. Additionally, accurate segmentation of droplet depends
on having a sufficient fluorescence signal of each droplet in comparison
to the background fluorescence in the gaps between the droplets. Therefore,
despite the progress made in recent years, sensitive and rapid monitoring
tools are needed to further facilitate high-throughput applications
of droplet-based microfluidics.20,21

In this work,
we extended the applicability of FCS for the study
of periodically passing objects. We demonstrate that this extension
converts FCS into a powerful detection method for droplet-based microfluidics,
enabling us to monitor rapidly and sensitively the flow and content
of passing droplets.

Materials and Methods
Production of Microfluidic
Devices
The microfluidic
devices (Figure S1) were designed with
QCAD-pro (RibbonSoft, Switzerland). Photomasks were printed on chrome-coated
soda lime glass (JD-Photodata, U.K.). For the photolithography process,
a negative photoresist (SU8–3025, MicroChem, U.S.A.) was spin-coated
(Laurell Technologies Corp., U.S.A.) onto silicon wafers at 2500 rpm
in order to get a uniform coating of 30 μm thickness. Wafers
were then placed on a hot plate for a 5 min soft bake at 65 °C,
then ramped slowly to 95 °C and held for 15 min. Following this,
the photoresist was exposed for 7.5 s to UV light through the corresponding
photomask using a mask aligner (MJB4, SÜSS MicroTec, Germany).
For the post-exposure bake, the wafers were placed for 1 min on a
hot plate at 65 °C and 5 min at 95 °C. The remaining resist
was removed with mr-DEV 600 developer (MicroChemicals, Germany). The
hard bake was carried out in an oven at 150 °C for 15 min. Soft
lithography was performed as previously described.22,23 Briefly, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS; Sylgard 184, Dow Corning, U.S.A.)
was prepared by mixing the oligomer with the polymerization catalyst
in a 9:1 (w/w) ratio. The mixed, degassed elastomer was poured over
the silicon wafer and cured at 65 °C for 2 h in the oven. After
curing, the flexible PDMS mold was peeled off the wafer and injection
holes with a diameter of 0.75 mm were punched (Biopsy Punch, World
Precision Instruments, U.S.A.). The device was cleaned with ethanol
and activated together with a 24 × 60 mm coverslip (#1, Carl
Roth, Germany) in an oxygen plasma (PVA TePla 100, PVA TePla, Germany;
0.45 mbar, 200 W, 20 s).24 After activation,
the PDMS device was pressed on the coverslip and heated for at least
2 h at 65 °C. Sigmacote (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) was applied
to the microchannels of the device in order to make their surfaces
hydrophobic.

Surfactant Synthesis
Following a
previously published
protocol,25,26 the synthesis of the PFPE (7000 g/mol)-PEG
(1400 g/mol)-PFPE (7000 g/mol) triblock copolymer was carried out
under argon atmosphere in dry THF solvent (tetrahydrofuran, 99.8%,
Carl Roth, Germany) in a heated Schlenk-flask. First, 1 mmol PEG (1400
mg, 1400 g/mol molecular weight, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) was dissolved
in 90 mL of dry THF and cooled to −78 °C. At this temperature,
1.25 mL of N-butyl lithium (1.6 M solution in hexane,
2 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) was added dropwise over 1 h and stirred
for additional 30 min. Under continuous stirring, the reaction was
slowly heated to room temperature and stirred for another 30 min.
Then, 14 g of Krytox FSH (PFPE-carboxylic acid, 2 mmol, 7000 g/mol
molecular weight, DuPont, Netherlands) was added dropwise over 30
min and stirred for 2 h. THF solvent with unreacted PEG was removed
by a separatory funnel. After two THF washing steps, the product was
dissolved in methanol (99.8%, Carl Roth GmbH, Germany) and dried with
a rotary evaporator at 40 °C. The quality of the synthesized
surfactant was analyzed by NMR and FT-IR measurements.

Droplet Production
For stable production of water-in-oil
droplets,27−29 a 5 mM solution of PFPE (7000 g/mol)-PEG (1400 g/mol)-PFPE
(7000 g/mol) in HFE-7500 oil (3M, U.S.A.) was used as the oil phase.
The aqueous phase consisted of PBS with 2 μM, 20 nM, or 2 nM
Alexa Fluor 647 (C2-maleimide, A20347, Molecular Probes) as indicated.
Different droplet production frequencies, between ∼2–20
kHz, were generated by adjusting the flow rates of the aqueous and
oil phases ranging from 400 to 1000 μL/h and 800 to 3000 μL/h,
respectively (Supplementary Table S1).
All fluids were injected into the microfluidic device using 1 mL syringes
(Omnifix-F, B. Braun Melsungen AG, Germany) connected by a cannula
(Sterican, 0.4 × 20 mm, BL/LB, B. Braun) and PTFE-tubing (0.4
× 0.9 mm, Bola, Germany). For a fine flow-control, syringe pumps
(Pump11Elite, Harvard Apparatus, U.S.A.) were used. High-speed camera
(Phantom 7.2, Vision Research, U.S.A.) was used for a visual quality
assessment of droplets production.

Encapsulation of Cells
CHO suspension cells were cultured
in growth medium (EX-CELL ACF DHO Medium, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany)
enriched with 4 mM solution of l-Glutamine (Gibco, ThermoFisher,
U.S.A.). Prior to encapsulation, the cells were centrifuged for 5
min at 700 rpm and resuspended in PBS containing 8 μM Hoechst
33342 (Trihydrochloride, ThermoFisher, U.S.A.). Following an incubation
of 10 min, the cells were washed three times by centrifugation and
resuspension with PBS. Finally, the cells were suspended in PBS containing
2 μM Alexa Fluor 647 (C2-maleimide, A20347, Molecular Probes)
to a concentration of 40 million cells per ml.

Microscopy
Fluorescence
intensity measurements of flowing
droplets were carried out on a LSM 880 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss,
Germany), using a C-Apochromat 40 × /1.2 W water-immersion objective
(Carl Zeiss, Germany). Samples were excited with 405 and 633 nm laser
lines, and fluorescence emission was detected within 419–615
nm and within 650–695 nm for the green and red detection channel,
respectively. The pinhole was fully opened, to maximize photon collection
and minimize optical sectioning. Photon count rate was detected and
recorded at a sampling rate of 15 MHz.

Data Analysis
Autocorrelation curves of the acquired
FCS data were calculated using the LSM software (ZEN, Carl Zeiss,
Germany) in parallel with the data acquisition. For further analyses,
the ConfoCor3 raw data files, listing time intervals between detected
photons, were converted using a C++ program to ASCII files indicating
the number of photons detected during each time bin (here 1 μs)
along the measurement—hence obtaining FD(t) and
FC(t). Where indicated, the single droplets were identified
along FD(t) by segmentation, as described in the text.
To segment encapsulated cells within each droplet, FC(t)
fragments corresponding to passing droplets were subjected to a modified
one-dimensional watershed algorithm. The analyses of FD(t) and FC(t), and the autocorrelation of simulated FD(t) traces, were done with Matlab (Mathworks, U.S.A.).

Simulations
Simulations of intensity traces of flowing
droplets were performed to systematically assess the derivation of
droplets flow and content parameters from the autocorrelation curve.
The input parameters for the simulation included the average fluorescence
intensity level within a droplet (Fd) and in the gap between droplets
(Fg), the average passing time of the droplets in the microfluidic
channel (Ld), the average passing time of the gap between each two
sequential droplets (Lg) and the variance of the droplet and gap passing
times (noise, Dn). The intensity value in each time point within a
droplet segment and within a gap segment was sampled from a Poisson
distribution having a mean value of Fd and Fg, respectively. The time
point at which a droplet segment ends, in respect to its start point,
was sampled from a normal distribution having a mean value of Ld and
a standard deviation of Dn. Similarly, the time point at which a gap
segment ends, in respect to its start point, was sampled from a normal
distribution having a mean value of Lg and a standard deviation of
Dn. All simulations were done in Matlab (Mathworks, U.S.A.).

Results
and Discussion
Interpreting the Autocorrelation of Periodically
Passing Objects
The autocorrelation function, G(τ),
of the recorded fluorescence
intensity fluctuation trace F(t) can be written as G(τ ) = ⟨δF(t)·δF(t
+ τ)⟩/⟨F(t)⟩2 + 1, where δF(t)
= F(t) – ⟨F(t)⟩. While the derivation of G(τ)
from F(t) is a straightforward calculation, the interpretation of
G(τ) depends on the mechanisms underlying the fluorescence fluctuations.
In the case of droplet flow, fluctuations along the intensity trace
of the droplet marker, FD(t), are caused mainly by the
constant flow of periodically passing droplets (Figure 1A and Figure S2). This periodicity in FD(t) is manifested by oscillations
in GD(τ) (Figure 1B).

Figure 1 FCS-based monitoring of droplet flow and content in high-throughput
microfluidics. (A) Schematic representation of a flow-focusing junction,
where cell-containing droplets are generated, and of the FCS-based
detection setup. Intensity fluctuations of a droplet marker, FD(t), and a cell marker, FC(t), are recorded at
high sampling rates (15 MHz) at a spot along a droplet-carrying microchannel.
(B) The autocorrelation curve of the droplet marker, GD(τ), is calculated instantaneously. From this curve, the following
parameters can be derived: (1) the period of GD(τ)
oscillations, τfp equals to 1/(droplet flow rate),
(2) the extent of damping in GD(τ) oscillations indicates
the variability of droplets size or speed, (3) the amplitude of GD(τ) can indicate changes in the (mean droplets fluorescence
intensity)/(mean gaps fluorescence intensity) ratio.

We identified several important parameters concerning
the droplets
flow and content that can be derived from the autocorrelation curve
GD(τ) (Figure 1B):(1) The τ value τfp, at which GD(τ)
reaches the first oscillation peak,
indicates the average time period that is needed for a droplet and
its subsequent gap to fully pass the observed volume. Hence, 1/τfp equals the flow rate of the droplets (i.e., the number of
droplets passing per time interval).

(2) In the case of homogeneous droplets
and gaps, GD(τfp) should be equal to the
amplitude of the autocorrelation curve, GD(0). Variation
in droplets or gap sizes would cause damping of the GD(τ)
oscillations, allowing the quantification of irregularities in the
flow of droplets, for example as 1 – GD(τfp)/GD(0).

(3) The autocorrelation amplitude, GD(0), equals to ⟨FD(t)2⟩/⟨FD(t)⟩2 (Supplementary Note S1). This implies that for homogeneously labeled droplets,
GD(0) = PD(1 – PD)(γ
– 1)2/(1 + PD(γ – 1))2 + 1, where PD = (mean droplet passing time)/τfp and γ is the ratio of droplets intensity over the
background fluorescence intensity in the gaps between droplets (Supplementary Note S1). The partial derivative
of GD(0) with respect to γ is positive, hence for
a given PD value, a higher autocorrelation amplitude implies
a higher droplets intensity (Supplementary Note S1), given γ > 1. Thus, the autocorrelation amplitude
provides a handle to monitor changes in droplets fluorescence intensity
due to biological or chemical processes.



Simulation Assessments of Autocorrelation Responses to Droplet
Parameters
We first assessed by simulations of droplet-marker
intensity traces, FD(t), the effects of droplet flow and
intensity on the autocorrelation curve GD(τ) (Figure 2). The results show
that droplet flow rates ranging from 20 Hz–5 MHz were accurately
inferred from the 1/τfp of the autocorrelation curve,
given FD(t) with a temporal resolution of 0.1 μs
(Figure 2, left column,
upper row). Hence, autocorrelation can capture correctly the maximum
theoretically feasible frequency, the Nyquist frequency, for a given
sampling rate.

Figure 2 Simulation-based assessment of the effects of droplet
flow parameters
on the autocorrelation curve GD(τ). Intensity fluctuation
traces of flowing droplets, FD(t), were simulated as described.
The default flow parameters were the following: intensity trace time
resolution = 0.1 μs (corresponding to a sampling rate of 10
MHz), mean droplet passing time = 1 μs, mean gap passing time
= 1 μs (resulting a flow rate of 500 kHz), standard deviation
(SD) of droplet and gap passing time = 20% of the mean passing time,
gap mean fluorescence intensity = 10 (a.u.), droplet mean fluorescence
intensity = 100 (a.u.). The length of the simulated FD(t)
spanned 5 passing droplets for the left and middle columns, and 15
passing droplets for the right column. Each column in the graph panel
corresponds to a given simulation parameter that was altered. The
ratio between the mean droplets intensity and mean gaps intensity
was altered by changing the former one. Each row in the graph panel
corresponds to a given parameter that was inferred from the autocorrelation
curve GD(τ). The damping of GD(τ)
was calculated as 1 – GD(τfp)/GD(0). Error bars indicate standard deviation (n = 300 simulation repeats).

The large changes in droplet flow rates, up to ∼2.5
MHz,
did not affect the damping extent and the amplitude of GD(τ)(Figure 2, left column). At 5 MHz, the damping extent of GD(τ)
decreased, reflecting under-sampling of the passing-time and intensity
of each single droplet. Changing the standard deviation of the passing
times of the droplets and gaps from 0 to 0.3 caused linearly proportional
changes in the damping extent of GD(τ), without changing
GD(0) or 1/τfp (Figure 2, middle column).

Changing the ratio
of the droplets intensity over the background
intensity in the gaps from 2 to 100 increased GD(0) (Figure 2, right column, bottom
row). As expected, at high droplet/gap intensity ratio GD(0) converges to 1+(1 – PD)/PD (here,
equals to 2), where PD (here 0.5) equals (mean droplet
passing time)/(mean droplet + gap passing time) (Supplementary Note S1). Increase of the droplet/gap intensity
ratio also enhanced the damping extent of GD(τ) but
did not affect τfp (Figure 2, right column).

Conventionally, the
monitoring of flowing droplets in microfluidics
is performed in the time domain (i.e., by recognizing each droplet
as an object along the recorded temporal intensity fluctuation trace).16−19 Such recognition requires to have a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio
of the labeled droplets to overcome stochastic fluctuations of intensity.
Moreover, high droplet flow rates reduce the sampling points for each
passing droplet, and hence reduce the statistical confidence in identifying
and distinguishing the single droplets. In contrast to time-domain
based analyses, autocorrelation captures and integrates the periodicity
of a signal. Therefore, even if the fluorescence signal of the droplets
is marginal, autocorrelation can be expected to capture their flow
by integrating a sufficient number of droplets. We first assessed
this expectation by simulating intensity traces of droplets flowing
at 500 kHz rate with different (mean droplets intensity)/(mean gap
intensity) ratios (Figure 3). The intensity of the droplets and gaps at each time bin
was sampled from a Poisson distribution around the mean droplets intensity
and the mean gaps intensity, respectively. At droplet/gap intensity
ratio ≤2, it is practically impossible to identify the single
droplets along the intensify traces (Figure 3, left column). Remarkably, autocorrelation
clearly detected the flow of droplets and accurately quantified its
rate, even at droplet/gap intensity ratio of 1.05 (Figure 3, right column). At droplet/gap
intensity ratio of 2, only 20 droplets were needed to be integrated
by autocorrelation for a clear quantification of their flow rate.
At the marginal droplet/gap intensity ratio of 1.05, the integration
power of autocorrelation utilized 100 000 droplets passing
during 0.2 s to clearly capture their flow rate.

Figure 3 Autocorrelation captures
the flow rates of droplets even with marginal
fluorescence intensity. Intensity fluctuation traces of flowing droplets,
FD(t), were simulated as described. The flow parameters
were the following: intensity trace time resolution = 0.1 μs,
mean droplet passing time = 1 μs, mean gap passing time = 1
μs (resulting a flow rate of 500 kHz), standard deviation of
droplet and gap passing time = 20% of the mean passing time, mean
gap fluorescence intensity = 10. The mean droplets fluorescence intensity
was varied to achieve different ratios with the mean gap intensity,
as indicated. The plots on the left show the simulated FD(t) for the first 10 μs, during which 4 droplets are fully
passing. The plots on the right show the autocorrelation curves, GD(τ), obtained from the corresponding FD(t)
spanning the indicated number of passing droplets (N).

To conclude, the simulation assessments indicate
that the autocorrelation
curve GD(τ) can (1) quantify accurately fast droplet
flow rates, up to the maximum theoretically possible for a given sampling
rate, (2) provide a quantitative measure for changes in the variability
of the droplets and gaps passing times, and (3) provide a quantitative
measure for changes in the droplets’ intensity/gap intensity
ratio, for a given droplet-flow condition. Given a sufficient fluorescence
intensity of droplets, it is enough to use short intensity traces,
spanning the mean passing time of 5–10 droplets, to achieve
accurately these quantifications. Additionally, the simulations show
that even with a negligible droplets fluorescence intensity, the autocorrelation
can accurately monitor and characterize their flow, by integrating
the signal over a larger number of droplets.

Experimental Assessment
of Droplet Monitoring by FCS
Following the assessment by
simulations, we tested experimentally
the effects of droplet flow conditions on the autocorrelation curve
GD(τ). First, we produced droplets containing 2 μM
Alexa Fluor 647 at different rates (Figure 4A and Figure S3) and measured their flow rates by autocorrelation (Figure 4B). FCS data acquisition of
the stream of droplets was performed at a spot adjacent to the flow-focusing
junction (Figure 1A).
Autocorrelation analysis of the recorded intensity traces shows that
the values of τfp get smaller as the input flow rates
increase, hence indicating a higher droplet flow rate (Figure 4B). As a quantitative control,
short time-lapse movies (∼300 ms) were recorded using a high-speed
camera, and the number of passing droplets per time period was counted
(Figure S3 and Table S1). The droplet flow
rates obtained from direct counting matched well those obtained from
autocorrelation analysis (Figure 4C). Hence, these results confirmed the capability of
autocorrelation to monitor accurately droplet flow rates.

Figure 4 Accurate quantification

Droplets were generated at different rates by modifying the input
flow rates of the aqueous and oil phases, as indicated in Supplementary Table S1. (A) High-speed camera

and highest (Fast rate) applied rates (Supplementary Table S1). Scale bar, 30 μm. (B) The autocorrelation,

flow rates by autocorrelation and direct droplet counting. Dashed
line indicates the line of equality. Error bars indicate the standard
deviation (n = 6 and n ≥
3 for the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively). The color-code
matches each data point in (C) with the corresponding example of autocorrelation
curve in (B).

Next, we experimentally
tested the effect of inhomogeneity in the
droplet flow on the autocorrelation curve GD(τ).
By high-speed camera imaging, we noticed that cell encapsulation affects
the speed of the encapsulating droplets, hence increases the variability
of the distances between passing droplets (Figure 5A). Therefore, cell encapsulation provides
an experimental system to induce droplet-flow inhomogeneity, which
is relevant for many potential microfluidic applications. In order
to generate flow variability, we added Hoechst-labeled cells into
the input aqueous phase, leading to encapsulation of cells in the
forming droplets (Figure 1A). At the applied droplet production rate (∼20 kHz),
cell encapsulation affected the speed of cell-containing droplets
(Figure 5A). To study
the effect of induced inhomogeneous droplet flow on GD(τ)
the density of cells was adjusted so that encapsulations were occurring
stochastically. As predicted, the damping of GD(τ)
oscillations was found to be much stronger for the sessions of droplet
production which included encapsulation of cells (Figure 5B,C).

FD(t) was recorded for droplets produced with or without
cells encapsulation. (A) High-speed camera transmission images of

mean ± standard deviation of the inferred level of periodicity
noise, calculated as 1 – GD(τfp)/GD(0). Error bars indicate standard deviation (n ≥ 6).

In order to experimentally assess the effects of droplet/gap
intensity
ratios on GD(τ), we produced droplets containing
different concentrations of the fluorescent marker. As expected, the
results show that for given flow conditions and excitation intensity,
the autocorrelation amplitude GD(0) decreases as the droplets
intensity decreases (Figure 6A). Remarkably, the autocorrelation provided an accurate measure
of the droplet flow rates even if their fluorescence intensity is
marginal (Figure 6A,
2 nM marker concentration). Moreover, autocorrelation captures the
flow of droplets and its rate even if the droplets are unlabeled (Figure 6B). This sensitive
detection is possible since autocorrelation averages negligible, periodic,
changes of intensity levels generated as droplets are passing through
the observed volume. The intensity changes are due to autofluorescence
of the oil phase, which is marginal but still higher in comparison
with the aqueous phase (Figure S4). Since
averaging reduces the random noise, but not the mean fluorescence
difference between droplets and gaps, autocorrelation increases the
signal-to-noise ratio. Of note, autofluorescence of the oil phase
is an important factor to account for, if its level is comparable
to, or higher than, the fluorescence signal of the droplets. Particularly,
if the fluorescence signal of the droplets is lower than the oil autofluorescence,
GD(0) will be lower than that of droplets with no fluorescence
signal. Therefore, when dealing with marginal fluorescence signals
it is important to measure the GD(0) of droplets containing
no marker and calibrate accordingly.

Figure 6 Effect of droplets relative fluorescence
intensity on their autocorrelation
curve. (A) Droplets were generated under the same flow conditions,
with aqueous phase containing a fluorescent marker (Alexa 647) at
20 nM or 2 nM in PBS, as indicated. The autocorrelation curves GD(τ) obtained for each measurement repeat of 10 s (thin
lines) and their average (thick line, n = 3) are
shown. (B) Autocorrelation curves and their averages (n = 3) of droplets containing PBS alone, or of flowing PBS without
droplets formation (due to lack of oil-phase flow into the cross-junction).
In (A) and (B) samples were excited solely with laser line 633 nm,
and with power attenuator set to 0.3% power for (A) and to 30% power
for (B). In the case of high laser power, a marginal autofluorescence
of the oil phase can be detected, enabling to monitor flowing droplets
containing no fluorescence marker. Thin and thick curves correspond
to the measurement repeats and their mean, respectively.

Temporal Resolution of Droplet Monitoring
by FCS
To
provide a real-time feedback for rapid changes in a periodic flow
of objects, the autocorrelation analysis should enable to derive information
from short segments of the intensity trace FD(t). The simulation
analysis indicated that given sufficient intensity, only few droplets
are needed to be integrated to enable their flow-rate detection (Figure 3). To test this using
experimental data, we applied multiresolution FCS (mrFCS)7 analysis, scanning the recorded intensity fluctuation traces with
different temporal integration levels. Toward this end, we partitioned
FD(t) to short time periods (ranging from 200 to 2000 μs)
and calculated GD(τ) for each period along the trace.
Analysis of a 500 μs period (5–10 droplets) was found
to be sufficient for detecting an inhomogeneity in the droplet flow
(Figure S5). Thus, by scanning FD(t) with a sliding window, and calculating GD(τ)
per each window, it is possible to monitor the cell-encapsulation
frequency at a temporal resolution of 500 μs, corresponding
to 5–10 passing droplets (Figure S5).

In addition to GD(τ), the amplitude of
the cell-marker autocorrelation, GC(τ), can be calculated
for each short time interval (Figure S5). In the absence of encapsulated cells the amplitude of GC(τ), GC(0), is low, due to uncorrelated intensity
fluctuations and weakly labeled small debris. In the presence of one
or more encapsulated cells GC(0) increases considerably,
since the cells are few in number, relatively big and strongly labeled.
Thus, GC(τ) and GD(τ) provide two
independent indicators for cell encapsulation.

Identifying Objects within
Flowing Droplets via FCS Data Acquisition
FCS relies on having
fast sampling rates, typically >10 MHz, in
order to capture accurately the residence time of diffusing particles
in the confocal volume. This provides high spatial resolution for
resolving signals of encapsulated cells or other objects within fast
flowing droplets (Figure 1A and Figure S2). Segmentation
of the droplets along FD(t) identifies the start and end
of each droplet along the trace, hence enables analyzing its content
along the corresponding part of the cell-marker intensity trace FC(t) (Figures S6 and S7). Thus,
encapsulated cells within each flowing droplet can be detected and
counted by segmenting them along the corresponding FC(t)
fragment (Figure S8).

Conclusions
This study shows that FCS can be effectively applied for the study
of periodically passing objects. To achieve this goal, we reconfigured
the manner by which the autocorrelation is interpreted and analyzed.
Moreover, we demonstrated that this approach converts FCS into a sensitive
analytical tool for monitoring flowing droplets and their content
in microfluidic devices. We showed that, in contrast to segmentation-based
methods, autocorrelation can monitor and quantify ultrafast droplet
flow rates accurately, even with very faint fluorescence signals.
Additionally, FCS can monitor the heterogeneity among sequentially
passing droplets at high temporal resolution and sensitivity. Therefore,
this approach paves a way toward hitherto impossible feedback control
for handling, processing, and manipulating of droplets and their content
in various high-throughput microfluidic units.

Utilizing the
power of FCS for the study of periodically passing
objects can facilitate and trigger a variety of additional applications
where microscale objects are spatially arranged in solution due to
flow, gravity, acoustic waves, or electromagnetic fields. Additionally,
this approach enables the use of FCS for detecting and analyzing immobilized
nanoscale objects patterned on a sliding specimen. Such a combination
would provide high-throughput molecular readouts for binding assays
and other in vitro analytical applications.
