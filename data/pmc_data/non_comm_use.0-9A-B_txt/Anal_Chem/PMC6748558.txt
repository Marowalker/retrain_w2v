The
future significance of energy conversion has stimulated intense
investigation of various electrocatalytic materials. Hence electrocatalysts
have become the subject of electrochemical characterization on a daily
basis. In certain cases of interest, when measuring electrochemical
reactions beyond the onset potentials, however, appropriateness of
existing electroanalytical methods may be questioned and alternative
approaches need to be developed. The present study highlights some
shortcomings in the electrochemical investigation of gas evolving
reactions. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is selected as a case
example with a specific focus on the electrochemical stability of
a nanoparticulate iridium catalyst. When conventional electrochemical
methods, such as thin film rotating disc electrodes are employed to
study the materials’ stability, the intrinsic degradation is
masked by oxygen bubbles, which are inherently being formed during
the reaction, especially when high current densities are used. In
this Letter, we present a solution to this issue, the so-called floating
electrode arrangement. Its elegant usage enables fast and reliable
electrochemical characterization of oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.

==== Body
One of the
pillars of the new
energy system is the use of hydrogen as an energy carrier, easily
produced under electrolysis of clean water and using renewable solar
or wind energy. While alkaline water electrolysis strongly prevailed
over the second half of the previous century, the last couple of decades
have seen a rapid development of proton exchange membranes (PEM),
due to their ability to sustain high current densities and effectiveness
in handling fast and large current alternations. Indeed, the PEM technology
has recently been recognized as a competitor for alkaline water electrolysis
(AWE), especially when it comes to large scale deployment as it promises
lower costs. However, PEM technology is still underdeveloped in terms
of reaching its ultimate performance.1,2 At the moment,
efficient water electrolyzers rely on rare platinum group metal (PGM)
catalysts. This is likely to cause problems if electrolysis systems
have to be produced on a larger scale due to their limited availability
and high cost. Enormous space for improvement is available by optimizing
the anodic counterpart of water electrolysis, namely, the oxygen evolution
reaction (OER). The most widely used electrocatalyst for OER are Ir
and Ru-based materials with the latter being more reactive but not
stable enough in the usual operating window.3,4 In
comparison to other PGMs, Ir is even more scarce, with only 0.001
ppm in earth’s crust. Therefore, an optimal OER catalyst design
should at the same time pursue an increase of the available electrochemically
active surface area (ECSA) and its stability enhancement.5−7

In order to reliably differentiate between numerous proposed
catalysts,
a prerequisite for efficient progress is an appropriate and reliable
electrochemical characterization of potential materials. In most cases,
in the initial stage, new catalysts are tested in conventional electrochemical
cells where rotating disc electrodes (RDE) are employed as working
electrodes. Usually glassy carbon, boron-doped diamond (BDD), or gold
discs are used as substrates on which a catalyst is deposited. However,
these electrodes suffer from several pitfalls. For example, GC electrodes,
and to some extent BDD, tend to oxidize under harsh conditions of
OER. This leads to passivation of the electrode surface and subsequent
inaccurate estimation of kinetic data.8 Additionally, when characterizing gas-evolving reactions such as
OER, the effect of gas bubbles on the active surface area should be
taken into account, as discussed in several recent publications.9−12 More specifically, Zeradjanin et al. showed that under OER conditions
there are regions on the electrode surface where the reaction interface
does not contain a sufficient amount of solvent to form a solvation
sphere around each generated molecule of oxygen.11 Consequently, oxygen bubbles nucleate in the nanoscale
region and eventually grow, causing passivation of the active surface.10,13,14 Gas bubbles tend to be removed
more effectively with imposing convection induced by rotation of the
electrode. However, as thoroughly discussed by Zeradjanin et al.,
even at a rotation of 10 000 rpm, the size of the diffusion
layer is insufficient to remove nanobubbles and even microbubbles
in the case of RDE.11 Therefore, immediate
attention should be given to the effect of oxygen bubbles, especially
since the state-of-the-art research within the topic of OER catalysis
is focusing on the development of stable high surface area composites.
In the course of a stability test where high potentials (up to 1.8
V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) are usually imposed, the
catalysts are even more prone to the formation of bubbles. The present
Letter directly addresses this issue. For this purpose, electrochemical
performance of an OER catalyst based on Ir nanoparticles is comparatively
investigated using a conventional RDE and a newly developed floating
electrode design.

Electrochemical Characterization
For the purpose of this study, a novel three electrode system has
been developed, where the working electrode operates in the so-called
floating mode. This means that the electrode is not dipped in the
electrolyte solution but is rather placed on its surface. The working
electrode compartment is made of two polyether ether ketone (PEEK)
holders which are connected via PEEK screws. In the present setup
(Figure 1a,b), the
upper part of the PEEK holder was coated with a copper foil tape (thickness
0.06 mm, Goldpart International Co., Ltd). Between these elements,
a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) gold grid (Ted Pella, outer
diameter 3.05 mm, 200 mesh grid) was inserted and served as the working
electrode (see Figure 1). Between the grid and the upper part of the PEEK holder, a metallic
spring, a metallic cone, and a gas diffusion layer (GDL) were inserted.
A GDL of 280 μm thickness and 40% Teflon weight wet proofing
(Toray Carbon Paper 090, Fuel CellStore) was used. It serves as a
spacer to separate the working electrode and its electric contact
(metallic cone). We note that Teflon gives the carbon material a hydrophobic
property, which prevents the electrolyte to penetrate to the metallic
cone or spring hence causing their corrosion. Additionally, the acidic
vapors could still pass through GDL and could damage the spring or
cause other down stream corrosion. In order to prevent this, a rubber
tube was inserted through the cone to the GDL. In this way, vapors
cannot reach metallic parts. GDL, together with the metallic cone
served as an electric contact for the TEM grid (working electrode,
see Scheme S-1b). A vacuum pump (Ted Pella,
for details see the Supporting Information section Vacuum suction methodology) was connected
to one of the holes of the peek housing via rubber tubing. Its role
was to assist in the removal of the oxygen bubbles, which are formed
in the course of OER (unless stated otherwise vacuum strength level
was always 1 in terms of relative units, see the Supporting Information section Vacuum suction methodology). The investigated electrocatalyst (homemade Ir nanoparticles, see
the Supporting Information sections Synthesis of high surface area iridium-based nanoparticles and Transmission electron microscopy characterization) was deposited on the grid by drop-casting a water suspension of
the catalyst on the TEM grid. The grid was placed on a Teflon holder
that was connected to a vacuum pump (Ted Pella, see the Supporting Information section Vacuum
suction methodology). Once the suspension was dropcasted,
the vacuum was turned on. This led to the formation of uniform catalyst
film coverage of the grid (see the Supporting Information section Scanning electron microscopy characterization). A platinum rod was used as a counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as
a reference electrode. HClO4 (0.1 M, 70%, 99.999% trace
metals basis, Merck) was used as a working electrolyte. Analogous
electrochemical experiments (as in the case of the floating electrode
study) were performed in the typical RDE configuration under 1600
rpm. A boron doped diamond disk electrode (BDD, d = 5 mm, NeoCoat) was used as a working RDE electrode. Chronoamperometry
was performed on each of the cell configurations, either under ambient
or vacuum suction conditions. In the latter case, a vacuum pump was
connected to the nonelectrolyte side of the TEM grid (Figure 1). Ohmic drop compensation
(95%) was performed during electrochemical experiments.

of part a. The dimensions of the entire assembly are shown on the
coordinate system in part a. The working electrode is placed on the
surface of the electrolyte solution so that it is in contact with
the electrolyte on the bottom and the air on the top.

Results and Discussion
The concept of a floating electrode
has been known since the 1960s
when it was introduced in the field of phosphoric acid fuel cells.15,16 After that, however, its development has been almost nonexistent.
Only recently the concept has been revived by Kuchernak’s group17 followed by a few other studies that have employed
a similar concept to study mass transport-limited reactions such as
oxygen reduction (ORR) and hydrogen oxidation (HOR) reactions.18,19 In the present study, however, the floating electrode is not used
primarily in order to enhance the transport of gas to the surface
of the catalyst. Rather than that, we employ such an electrode, for
the first time, as an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) diagnostic tool.
Since OER is a gas evolving reaction, in contrast to HOR and ORR,
high mass transfer of reactants is not an issue. By contrast, the
main issue of OER is the removal of the products, namely, oxygen gas.
The floating electrode configuration might, however, effectively circumvent
the “passivation” of the electrode surface with oxygen
bubbles, which presents a serious issue in the RDE setups. Such circumvention
could be provided due to the special positioning of the catalyst layer
which is in direct contact with the gas phase. In order to inspect
the feasibility of the floating electrode for OER characterization,
an in-house electrochemical system was developed (Figure 1). The electrochemical activity
for OER was evaluated under linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) conditions.
The electrochemical performance of two distinctly different electrode
loadings (1 and 5 μg) was initially tested in order to test
the basic feasibility of the floating electrode method (Figure S-6). As demonstrated, both electrode
loadings gave more or less the same OER performance (in terms of mass
normalized current densities). This is a direct confirmation that
the catalyst layer was completely utilized in both cases.

In
continuation, the ability of the floating electrode to efficiently
remove oxygen bubbles was tested during a potentiostatic treatment.
A potential hold was performed at 2.0 V (Figure S-7). A vacuum pump was connected to the working electrode
housing (see Figure 1a,b). We note that such potential is outside the scope of oxygen
evolution reaction investigation. We have used such vigorous conditions
in order to intentionally induce the formation of oxygen bubbles.
It can be seen that the presence of vacuum suction during electrochemical
treatment has a clear effect on the current response (Figure S-7a,b). In particular, vacuum enhances
the occurrence of repetitive current oscillations, whereas without
vacuum suction oscillations stop, which indicates the onset of passivation
of the electrode with bubbles. Thus, the oscillations seen under vacuum
occur due to the efficient transient removal of the continuously growing
oxygen bubbles through the holes of the Au grid. Once the bubbles
have been removed, the electrochemical surface area is revived and
again available for OER to proceed. By gradually increasing the level
of vacuum, the current response increases as well (Figure S-7a,b). Overall, the electrochemical comparison of vacuum and ambient (nonvacuum) treatments
clearly indicated the potential benefits of the former mode.

In order to demonstrate the potential advantages of the floating
electrode in a more quantitative way, the results obtained with this
method were compared to the results of a typical conventional electrochemical
methodology for characterization of electrocatalysts, the thin film
rotating disc electrode (TF-RDE) method (Figure 2, and Figure S-9). The experimental protocol consisted of OER activity estimation
via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) treatment (20 mV s–1), followed by a chronoamperometric protocol (1.8 or 2.0 V vs RHE,
2000 s) and an additional activity LSV estimation (20 mV s–1) to estimate the activity decay. Performance comparison of the methods
is demonstrated in Figure 2. The same total catalyst loadings were used in both cases.
Fascinatingly, under chronoamperometric conditions, the OER activity
of the two electrode types is remarkably different, that is, the mass
normalized current densities are in general higher in the case of
the floating electrode. This is due to the better utilization of the
catalyst layer in the former. The reason for such better utilization
is the continual removal of gas bubbles, which is not present in the
case of RDE (see Figure S-10). As seen
from the chronoamperometric response, the repetitive removal of gas
bubbles results in oscillations described before. More importantly,
however, the average current reaches a steady-state level much faster
and at significantly higher values. Very likely, this value is much
closer to the actual intrinsic activity of the catalyst. After potentiostatic
treatment, the LSV protocol was performed again in order to estimate
the decay of OER activity (Figure 2b) during potentiostatic treatment. The OER activity
is lower in the case of RDE configuration. This trend is in line with
the fact that oxygen bubbles stay in the catalyst film and passivate
the electrode surface in the RDE configuration (see Figure S-10). Hence the effective catalyst surface is lower
in this case. In any case, the comparison of floating and RDE configuration
highlights a serious pitfall of conventional RDE methodology in the
case of OER diagnostics. Namely, RDE passivation of the electrode
via oxygen bubbles obviously cannot be avoided, which means that the
activity readings are affected in an uncontrolled way. This directly
impacts the optimal development of novel electrocatalysts. For example,
by using RDE methodology solely, the electrochemical performance of
different electrocatalysts is difficult to compare, which may result
in misleading trends. However, it has to be noted that further optimization
of the floating electrode architecture is necessary in order to maximize
the removal of the oxygen bubbles.

and RDE. (a) Chronoamperometric treatment at 1.8 V vs RHE (2000 s)

and after potentiostatic treatment (dashed lines).

Conclusion
The present study shows that the use of conventional
electrochemical
methods for investigating gas-evolving reactions, such as oxygen evolution
reactions, suffers from the unavoidable blockage of the active surface
by the formed gas bubbles. In the case of high surface area electrocatalysts,
the evolution of bubbles passivates the electrode surface; hence,
their intrinsic characteristics (activity, stability) are difficult
to monitor. This issue was demonstrated with the rotating disc electrode
method and a high surface area nanoparticulate iridium catalyst. As
an alternative to RDE, the floating electrode concept was introduced,
where a TEM grid was used as a working electrode. In general, this
approach hugely reduces the passivation of the electrode with gas
bubbles and hence allows performance measurements of the catalyst
that are much closer to the real intrinsic values. This approach offers
a new dimension toward a more efficient development of gas evolving
electrocatalysts.
