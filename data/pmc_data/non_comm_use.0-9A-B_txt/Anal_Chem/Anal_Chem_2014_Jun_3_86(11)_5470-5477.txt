Urine is an important, noninvasively
collected body fluid source
for the diagnosis and prognosis of human diseases. Liquid chromatography
mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based shotgun proteomics has evolved as
a sensitive and informative technique to discover candidate disease
biomarkers from urine specimens. Filter-aided sample preparation (FASP)
generates peptide samples from protein mixtures of cell lysate or
body fluid origin. Here, we describe a FASP method adapted to 96-well
filter plates, named 96FASP. Soluble urine concentrates containing
∼10 μg of total protein were processed by 96FASP and
LC-MS resulting in 700–900 protein identifications at a 1%
false discovery rate (FDR). The experimental repeatability, as assessed
by label-free quantification and Pearson correlation analysis for
shared proteins among replicates, was high (R ≥
0.97). Application to urinary pellet lysates which is of particular
interest in the context of urinary tract infection analysis was also
demonstrated. On average, 1700 proteins (±398) were identified
in five experiments. In a pilot study using 96FASP for analysis of
eight soluble urine samples, we demonstrated that protein profiles
of technical replicates invariably clustered; the protein profiles
for distinct urine donors were very different from each other. Robust,
highly parallel methods to generate peptide mixtures from urine and
other body fluids are critical to increase cost-effectiveness in clinical
proteomics projects. This 96FASP method has potential to become a
gold standard for high-throughput quantitative clinical proteomics.

==== Body
Using liquid
chromatography
mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based technologies developed over the past
decade, body fluid proteomes can be surveyed with protein abundances
in a dynamic range of 5 orders of magnitude, allowing identification
of thousands of proteins at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% without
extensive fractionation prior to LC-MS.1,2 Urine is a
sample source of high importance for clinical proteomic studies because
it is easily available and collected noninvasively, thus eliminating
health risks for the donor. The identity and quantity of proteins
excreted into urine may reflect pathological conditions that can be
traced to different organs in the body, particularly the kidneys,
prostate and urogenital tract.3 The urinary
proteome has been studied for more than a decade with LC-MS based
technologies,4−6 resulting in the identification of more than 1500
distinct proteins associated with at least 58 different gene ontology
(GO) molecular function categories.6 The
functional diversity demonstrates the richness of urine as a source
of identifying perturbations in biological pathways and organ malfunctions
in the human body. An area of considerable interest in urinary proteomics
is the identification of pathogens.7−9 A survey for the year
2006 estimated that the occurrence of 1.7 million emergency room visits,
11 million physician visits, and half a million hospitalizations in
the U.S. alone were due to urinary tract infections (UTI) resulting
in 3.5 billion dollars of health care costs.10 Shotgun proteomics succeeds in identifying microbial proteins from
urine independent of the ability to detect microbes in a urine laboratory
culture, the most commonly used method to determine the pathogen causing
a UTI.11 Urinary pellets derived from patients
diagnosed with either asymptomatic bacteriuria or UTI were recently
used to identify urinary tract-colonizing bacteria with metagenomic
and metaproteomic methods.9

A typical
shotgun proteomics workflow involves protein extraction
from tissues, cells, or body fluids, enzymatic digestion and LC-based
peptide fractionation in one or multiple dimensions followed by MS-based
protein identification.12 To extract, solubilize,
and denature proteins, detergents, such as SDS and NP-40, and chaotropic
reagents, such as urea and thiourea, are commonly used.12 Solubilized protein mixtures are not directly
applied to in-solution digestion because the presence of detergents
and chaotropic reagents reduces the activity of the proteolytic enzyme
(e.g., trypsin). Incomplete digestion decreases the number of available
peptide analytes of LC-MS. For example, 0.1% SDS leads to an ∼80%
loss of trypsin activity.13 Furthermore,
trace amounts of SDS can cause significant signal suppression in LC-MS
experiments.14 Detergent removal by precipitation
of proteins with organic solvents prior to digestion15 or precipitation of peptides with KCl after digestion16 have been employed to reduce the adverse effects
of detergents and improve proteome coverage. Among the many detergent
depletion techniques that have been explored, a filter aided sample
preparation (FASP) method appears to be the most effective one to
achieve high protein coverage in shotgun proteomic analyses.17,18 A standard FASP ultrafiltration device, usually having a load volume
of less than 500 μL and a 30 kDa molecular weight cutoff (MWCO),
facilitates removal of detergents and chaotropic reagents and equilibration
in buffers ideal for the reduction, alkylation and digestion steps.
Enzymatic digestion of protein mixtures occurs directly on the filter
membrane.17,18 The digested peptides, most of which have
MW values of less than 5 kDa, are smaller than the filter’s
MWCO and pass through the membrane upon centrifugation. These versatile
features of the FASP method have resulted in its application in numerous
proteomic projects.19−23

Recent method development efforts focused on pre- or post-FASP
fractionation to reduce the sample complexity and to improve proteome
coverage.24−26 For instance, the separation of FASP-related protein
digests into six fractions via strong anion exchange (SAX) allowed
identification of 4,206 proteins from mouse hippocampus tissue.25 Prefractionation of proteins using size exclusion
chromatography followed by SAX and FASP allowed Nagaraj et al. to
identify more than 10 000 HeLa cell proteins.24 Peptide fractionation by high pH reversed-phase LC following
FASP was described in a report on the BV-2 microglial cell proteome,
which consisted of 5494 identified proteins.26 All aforementioned studies focused on proteome coverage rather than
parallel sample processing. The use of FASP was also reported for
the comparative proteomic analysis of cell lines and tissues, processing
up to 30 samples in parallel to examine disease-related and prognostic
protein biomarkers.23,27,28 In clinical proteomics, it is desirable to process large numbers
of samples to achieve the statistical power necessary to identify
promising biomarker candidates.29 Therefore,
development of a reliable, highly parallel FASP method using a 96-well
filter plate is a worthwhile endeavor. The potential benefits are
batch-mode operation of up to 96 samples, which could lower the requirements
of experimental repetition, and overall cost-effectiveness.

To our knowledge, the first report on the use of FASP in 96-well
plates was published recently. Switzar et al.30 used a 96-well plate with built-in 10 kDa MWCO membrane filters
and a stepwise process to generate cellular protein digests. This
method was evaluated using different organic solvent wash steps and
compared to a gel filtration method for purification of peptide mixtures.
Up to 442 proteins with a FDR of less than 0.1% were identified from
HEK293T cell lysates in a single LC-MS experiment, using the LTQ-Orbitrap
Velos system for MS. In depth assessments of experimental repeatability
of FASP in 96-well plates were not part of this study. Urine is a
challenging sample source due to high abundances of only a few proteins
and the richness in functional protease inhibitors that interfere
with tryptic digestion unless they are inactivated first.6,31 Here, we show that 96-well based parallel FASP processing of human
urine specimens including soluble and insoluble fractions, combined
with LC-MS, is robust and repeatable and yields high proteome coverage.

Experimental
Section
Urine Specimens and Urine Sample Preparation for 96FASP
One set of human urine specimens was from a study of juveniles diagnosed
with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) including matched sibling controls. Participants
were informed that urine specimens were to be used for research purposes.
Midstream urine was collected in a doctor’s office. A Human
Subject Protocol was established and approved by JCVI’s Internal
Review Board. Human subject informed consent was obtained. The other
set of human urine specimens was related to a study of urinary tract
infections (UTI) where samples were obtained as medical waste from
a urine diagnostics laboratory. The study was exempted from the requirement
of a Human Subject Protocol by JCVI’s Internal Review Board.
For both studies, urine samples were received after specimen deidentification.
They were stored at 4 °C for maximally 6 h prior to transfer
to the JCVI laboratory and storage at −20 °C. The starting
volumes of urine sample aliquots ranged from 20 to 50 mL. After centrifugation
at 3000 × g for 15 min at 10 °C, urine supernatants were
concentrated with an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device (10
kDa MWCO, Millipore) at 3000 × g to a volume
of ∼1.0 mL and are referred to as UC samples. Resulting urinary
pellets from UTI specimens were recovered and are referred to as UP
samples. The type of filter plate used here was equipped with cellulose
membrane filters with a 10 kDa MWCO (MultiScreen Ultracel-10; catalogue
number: MAUF01010; Millipore). From here on, we refer to this filter
plate as the 96FASP plate. We are not aware of other 96-well filter
plate products with a larger MWCO. UC samples were denatured with
1% SDS (w/v) and 50 mM DTT at 95 °C for 10 min; UP samples were
lysed with a solution of 8 M urea, 1% SDS, 5 mM EDTA and 50 mM DTT
prior to 96FASP plate analysis. A protocol described previously,18 also used here for a comparative proteomic analysis
with UC samples and the single-filter FASP device (Vivacon 30 kDa
MWCO, Sartorius, Germany), was employed using 96FASP plates with minor
modifications as shown in Figure 1. Experimental
procedures are also described in detail in the Supporting Information.

Figure 1 Overview of the experimental procedures
performed in this study.
Briefly, the urine sample is centrifuged to separate urinary pellet
(UP) from urinary supernatant fraction, which is then followed by
concentration using Amicon filter. The urinary concentrates (UC) and
UP are then subjected to filter aided sample preparation processing
using single filter (FASP) or multiwell format filter (96FASP). The
peptides after on-filter digestion are desalted using StageTip, and
analyzed by LC-Q Exactive MS/MS and computational database search.

NanoLC-MS/MS Method
The nanoLC-MS/MS
analysis was performed
on a Ultimate 3000 nano LC and Q Exactive mass spectrometer system
coupled with a FLEX nanoelectrospray ion source (all components were
from Thermo Scientific). The peptide samples were first loaded onto
a trap column (C18 PepMap100, 300 μm × 5 mm,
5 μm, 100 Å, Thermo Scientific), and then separated on
a PicoFrit analytical column (75 μm × 10 cm, 5 μm
BetaBasic C18, 150 Å, New Objective, MA) at a flow
rate of 300 nL/min. For a 130 min LC-MS run, a linear gradient was
applied from 100% solvent A to 35% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in
acetonitrile) over 110 min, followed by a steeper gradient to 80%
solvent B over 15 min. The column was re-equilibrated with solvent
A for 5 min. For a 90 min LC-MS run, the linear gradient time extended
over 70 min (from 0 to 35% solvent B). Eluting peptides were sprayed
at a voltage of 2.0 kV and acquired in a MS data-dependent mode using
XCalibur software (version 2.2, Thermo Scientific). Survey scans were
acquired at a resolution of 70,000 over a mass range of m/z 250 to m/z 1,800
with an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 106. For
each cycle, the ten most intense ions were subjected to fragmentation
by higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with normalized collision
energy of 27%. Peptide ion fragments from the MS/MS scans were acquired
at a resolution of 17,500 with an AGC target of 5 × 104. Dynamic exclusion was enabled, as MS/MS ion scans were repeated
once and then excluded from further analysis for 20 s. Unassigned
ions and those with a charge of +1 were rejected from further analysis.

Protein Identification and Quantification Methods
The
raw files acquired by the MS system were processed using the Proteome
Discoverer platform (version 1.4, Thermo Scientific). An integrated
workflow using the algorithms Sequest HT and Mascot (version 2.4,
Matrix Science) was employed. Either a human UniProtKB database (Release
2013_6; 88 295 human sequences) or a database consisting of
the aforementioned human proteins and all protein sequences derived
from 21 microbial genomes (Supporting Information Table S-1) were used. The latter database was used to identify human
and microbial proteins present in UP samples. MS search parameters
similar to published previously27 are described
in detail in Supporting Information. For
protein quantification of the data sets, the MaxQuant software suite
(version 1.4.2) was used.32 Most of the
default settings provided in this software suite were accepted, and
data were processed using both the label-free quantitation (LFQ) and
the intensity-based absolute quantitation (iBAQ) tools. The LFQ algorithms
provide relative quantification of the integrated MS1 peak
areas from the high resolution MS data. The iBAQ algorithms sum the
integrated peak intensities of the peptide ions for a given protein
divided by the number of theoretically observable peptides, which
are calculated by in silico digestion of protein sequences including
all fully tryptic peptides with a length of 6–30 amino acids.33

Results and Discussion
96FASP Evaluation Compared
to the Single-Filter FASP Method
To our best knowledge, only
one type commercially available 96-well
filter plate is suitable for FASP. It is equipped with Ultracel-10
membrane filters and has a 10 kDa MWCO. The FASP method with single-filter
devices has been evaluated for filters with MWCO values of 3,18 10,18 and 30 kDa.25,34 The 30 kDa MWCO filter device was reported to facilitate sample
preparation with shorter centrifugation times and to generate a larger
quantity of peptides in a MW range suitable for MS analysis compared
to the 10 kDa MWCO filters.34 For the performance
comparison (single-filter FASP versus 96FASP), the 30 kDa MWCO single-filter
device was selected. The sample chosen to evaluate the quality of
proteomic data including experimental repeatability of the 96FASP
method was a soluble urinary concentrate (UC) derived from a donor
with an apparent urinary tract infection. Experimental repeatability
is defined as the repeated analysis of the proteome of a sample processed
in the same laboratory, LC-MS instrument, and LC-MS methods, following
guidelines proposed by Tabb et al.35 We
did not assess experimental reproducibility.

The question presented
itself as to whether the 96FASP plate with the relatively low MWCO
of 10 kDa and limited centrifugal forces applied in a plate-adapted
centrifuge allowed ultrafiltration of high molarity solutions (8 M
urea) in a reasonable time frame. Completion of a 96FASP experiment
included denaturation and concentration of a body fluid or cell lysate
sample, protein reduction, protein alkylation, and intermittent wash
steps at centrifugal forces of 2,600 × g prior
to enzymatic digestion overnight (Figure 1).
In contrast, the single-filter device for FASP allowed spins at centrifugal
forces as high as 14 000 × g. Using UC
samples estimated to contain 10–15 μg of protein, we
determined that a volume reduction of 200 μL of UA buffer to
less than 50 μL in wells of a 96FASP plate required centrifugation
times of 45–60 min. This seems reasonable as indicated by a
previous study that 10 kDa MWCO filters usually take three to four
times longer than 30 kDa filters, which traditional FASP typically
use.34 The entire 96FASP procedure prior
to overnight digestion, including urine concentrate denaturation,
alkylation and intermittent centrifugation steps, requires 4–6
h depending on the UA buffer volume, the total protein amount loaded
and possibly the presence of other macromolecular substances. While
longer centrifugation times are a comparative weakness of 96FASP,
the ability to parallelize pipetting steps, reduce sample handling
and the prospects of automating the process on robotic platforms are
significant advantages in comparison to traditional single filter-based
FASP methods. Then we assessed whether removal of SDS applied in a
1% concentration was achieved during UA buffer wash steps. Indeed,
SDS signals in LC-MS runs were not observed (Supporting
Information Figure S-1). This was encouraging because a 1%
SDS solution facilitates the lysis of microbial and mammalian cells,
solubilization of proteins integrated in phospholipid membranes and
extraction of proteins from tissues and other clinical samples.36,37 1% SDS also denatures proteins and thus improves the effectiveness
of proteolysis at the cleavage sites expected for a given protease.
Using the same 96-well filter plate source, Switzar et al. reported
using a 0.1% SDS solution for HEK293T cell lysis.30 A high molarity urea solution was not used during the subsequent
wash steps to deplete SDS from the protein sample prior to enzymatic
digestion. The omission of urea during the FASP wash steps may have
resulted in decreased protease activity and lower proteome coverage.34 Retention of SDS in a peptide mixture also impacts
ion suppression during LC-MS analysis.34,38

Experimental
Repeatability Assessed for the Entire Workflow
Approximately
10–15 μg of total protein from one UC
sample was loaded into five different wells of a 96FASP plate and
processed as shown in Figure 1, defined here
as 96-well replicates. Duplicate LC-MS runs for each well injecting
∼2 μg of the digested peptide mixture with a simple 90
min gradient were performed, defined here as LC-MS replicates. On
average, 3955 unique peptides (±241, SD; n =
5) and 852 (±7) protein groups were identified from each well
at a 1% FDR. The analytical performance of 96FASP with approximately
five peptides per protein group was in the expected range given that
the stochastic sampling of proteomes with only a few highly abundant
proteins by LC-MS/MS generally decreases peptide identifications per
protein for many low and medium abundant proteins.12 This is also illustrated in Figure 3. The percentages of shared peptide and protein identifications among
the 96-well replicates were on average 82.1% (±5.8, SD; n = 20) and 75.4% (±2.2), respectively. Of the 852
protein groups, 60.3% were shared among all five 96-well replicates
(Supporting Information Figure S-2A). Variability
in peptide identifications is clearly associated with the stochastic
sampling nature of a data-dependent MS2 analysis, particularly
in the context of low abundance proteins.35 Indeed, proteins surveyed exclusively in a single replicate were
represented to approximately 75% by a single unique peptide, thus
supporting the notion of peptide identification variability in the
low protein abundance range. As shown in Figure S-2B (Supporting Information), the average percentage
of shared peptide and protein identifications among LC-MS replicates
was 82.2% (±0.9, n = 5) and 75.9% (±1.5),
respectively. These values were almost indistinguishable from those
of the 96-well replicates. We conclude that replication of 96FASP
analysis in the wells of a single plate introduces relatively low
variability at the sample preparation stage. The LFQ analysis tool
was used to demonstrate low quantitative differences for the 513 proteins
shared among all five 96-well replicates. The LFQ algorithms sum the
normalized peptide intensities for a given protein. The tool has been
widely used for proteome-wide relative quantification.28,39−41 The heat map for plate I displayed in Figure 2 (right panel) visualizes the overall high similarity
of protein abundances across all five experiments and was confirmed
by pairwise Pearson correlation analysis. The Pearson correlation R values ranged from 0.980 to 0.993 among the 96-well replicates
(Supporting Information Figure S-2C). In
conclusion, we demonstrate that the analytic process starting with
96FASP features excellent well-to-well repeatability. Peptide/protein
identification differences for the data from different wells appear
to be primarily linked to variability at the LC-MS stage.

Figure 2 Unsupervised
hierarchical clustering of LFQ intensities of urinary
proteins identified in eight separate 96FASP wells. Two LC-MS replicates
(rep1 and rep2) were acquired for each well. In the first experiment
(plate I, right panel), five wells (B8–B12) were used to examine
well-to-well repeatability. The experiment was repeated using three
wells (D6–D8) from a different 96FASP (plate II, left panel).
A high level of similarity in the abundances of matched proteins across
experiments is visualized in the heap map. Pearson correlation analyses
revealed average R values of 0.994 (±0.002,
SD; n = 8) for LC-MS replicates, 0.985 (±0.005, n = 13) for 96-well replicates, and 0.967 for those 96-well
replicates derived from different plates. For the LFQ analyses, the
minimum number of unique peptides per protein used for quantitation
was set at 2. Only those proteins quantified in all experiments (335
in total) were included in the clustering and correlation analyses.

Experiments to assess 96FASP repeatability
were continued using
the same UC sample in a different 96-well plate (plate II, Figure 2, left panel). Regarding depth of coverage and repeatability
of quantification of proteins (Supporting Information Figure S-3A), the proteomic profiles of three 96-well replicates
were comparable to those of plate I. Importantly, the comparison of
the data comparing individual wells from plate I versus plate II revealed
equally low variability (Figure 2 and Supporting Information Figure S-3B). We suggest
that experiments with a second 96-well filter plate, 3 weeks after
completion of the first experiment, did not adversely affect repeatability.
Another experiment was conducted to examine whether protein loading
in a 96-well plate could increase without compromising sample processing
times and data quality. UC samples with ∼65 μg total
protein were processed in five wells of a 96FASP plate. As expected,
the centrifugation time to reduce the UA buffer volume from 200 μL
to 50 μL increased to 70 to 90 min. With a 130 min LC gradient
run, 5,810 unique peptides (±441, SD; n = 5)
and 1,075 unique protein groups (±45) were identified on average
at a 1% FDR. Quantitative assessments using LFQ-based intensity and
Pearson correlation analyses revealed remarkably high R values (0.985 ± 0.006, n = 10; Supporting Information Figure S-4), when comparing
the data among 96-well replicates. In summary, evaluations of experimental
repeatability and urinary proteome coverage using the 96FASP method
were encouraging with respect to interwell and interplate comparisons
as well as the increase of protein loading amounts.

Data Comparison
Using Single-Filter FASP Method
The
same UC sample (10–15 μg protein) was processed using
the single-filter device in triplicates followed by LC-MS, resulting
in 7164 (±131, SD; n = 3) peptide identifications
corresponding to 1063 (±15, SD) protein groups. In comparison
with 96FASP (samples were prepared simultaneously), 4959 (±155)
peptide identifications corresponding to 894 (±18) protein groups
were obtained. The number of peptide and protein identifications employing
96FASP was 31% and 16% lower, respectively, compared to single-filter
FASP (further illustrated in Supporting Information Figure S-5). The Pearson correlation coefficients ranged from 0.938
and 0.962 with an average R value of 0.947 (n = 9), comparing LFQ-based protein intensities for two
data sets, one from 96FASP and the other from single-filter
FASP (Supporting Information Figure S-6).
Likely causes of the moderately lower performance of 96FASP were the
3- to 4-fold longer centrifugation times in 96-well filter plates
and differences in the material of the polypropylene-based collection
plate versus the filter device. The plate material may adsorb more
peptides and result in lower recovery compared to the single-filter
collection device. We previously switched from a polystyrene-based
collection plate which had revealed even higher peptide adsorption
and low recovery assessed by LC-MS with a urinary protein load of
10–15 μg. Polystyrene-based lids may also compromise
peptide recovery as suggested before.30 We did not attempt to replace this lid with an alternative one.
The 96-well plate lids also did not seal the plate. A buffer volume
of at least 100–150 μL had to be added for the digestion
step to prevent evaporation. In addition, as discussed in the first
paragraph, differences in the MWCO of the membranes may influence
urinary proteome coverage.

Represented Biological Functions in the UC
Sample
Combining
all protein identifications from 96FASP experiments performed with
one UC sample, 10 974 identified unique peptide sequences corresponded
to 2339 unique proteins (Supporting Information Table S-2). The 1247 protein groups (53.3%) were identified based
on a single unique peptide. This result is consistent with data from
a previous urinary proteome survey.41 The
urinary proteome has a high dynamic range of abundances (>105). The top 3 proteins accounted for almost 25% of the total
protein
mass, the top 20 proteins for approximately 50% of it. Therefore,
lower abundance proteins are more challenging to identify unless further
fractionation or immunodepletion techniques are employed. The average
sequence coverage was 17.6%, and the average number of identified
peptides per protein was 5. We assessed the dynamic range of protein
abundances using the intensity-based absolute quantitation (iBAQ)
algorithm.27,33 This algorithm generates estimates
of abundance for quantitative comparison of different proteins present
in the same sample.33 From five 96-well
replicates, the median values of 854 proteins which passed iBAQ-integrated
quality filters were calculated and plotted. As shown in Figure 3A, the dynamic range
of protein abundances in the urine sample was ∼5.5 orders of
magnitude. The 20 most abundant proteins made up 52.8% of the total
protein mass. Immunoglobulin kappa chain (rank 1) and 37 other immunoglobulin
subunits or isoforms contributed 26.9% to the total protein mass in
the UC sample. Histones, proposed to have antimicrobial properties
during infection,42 contributed 5%. This
included histones H4 (rank 5), H3.1 (rank 25), H2A (rank 28), and
H2B (rank 54). High histone quantities were not observed for other
UC samples surveyed here and in two other urinary proteome surveys.43,44 Increased quantities of leukocytes which infiltrate the urothelium,
apoptose and lyse during a urinary tract infection explain the release
of nuclear contents, including histones, into the urine. Urothelial
cell exfoliation also occurs as a defense mechanism to wash invading
bacteria out of the urinary tract.10 Other
proteins contributing to the innate immune defense, such as protein
S100A8 (rank 9), neutrophil defensin 1 (rank 12), protein S100A9 (rank
15) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (rank 17) and lactotransferrin
(rank 16), accounted for 7.4% of the total protein mass. A global
functional analysis for this urinary proteome was performed using
the DAVID bioinformatics resource with Gene Ontology (GO) Biological
Process (BP) terms.45 Significantly enriched
BP terms for 1,200 proteins that were recognized by the DAVID tool
from the UC sample were compared to a reference data set with a similar
depth of coverage.43 The latter pertained
to the urinary proteome of acute appendicitis and control subjects.
Our data set revealed enriched BP terms for acute inflammatory response
(p-value of 3.66 × 10–24)
and response to wounding (p-value of 2.14 ×
10–22), with 48 and 120 protein identifications,
respectively (Supporting Information Figure
S-7). Since the UC sample was derived from a human subject with UTI
symptoms, the analysis confirmed the functional importance of inflammatory
and tissue regenerative processes in the urinary tract compared to
a condition of distal inflammation (acute appendicitis).

urinary tract infection. Median iBAQ values of five 96-well replicates
were calculated for each of the 854 proteins identified with at least
two unique peptides and plotted against the proteins’ abundance
rank. The highlighted areas show the most abundant and least abundant
protein groups in the top graph, whereas the bottom two graphs depict
these areas in a magnified view including the short names for 20 proteins
in the two groups. IGK and IGH are immunoglobulin chains.

96FASP for Urinary Tract Infection Diagnostics
Urinary
pellet (UP) samples were isolated from specimens of human donors positive
in at least two of three diagnostic tests for UTI (elevated leukocyte
esterase activity; nitrite concentration; bacterial cell counts >105/mL urine). Five samples were analyzed using 96FASP. UP samples
were resuspended in a denaturing solution, incubated and sonicated
to achieve cell lysis. Considering higher phospholipid and lipid content
in such lysates compared to UC samples that may clog filters, it was
of interest to evaluate whether the 96FASP method permitted the use
of equal loading aliquots of total protein (10–20 μg).
Centrifugation times for the UP samples were not prolonged and digestions
were equally efficient. An integrated database including the human
proteins and protein sequences for microbial species causing∼98%
of all diagnosed UTIs was used for analysis of LC-MS data.46 In four of them, microbial species Escherichia
coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae, both are
common causes of UTI, were confidently identified based on ≥10
bacteria proteins (Supporting Information Table S-3). Hierarchical clustering data shown in the heat map of
Figure 4A revealed that the protein abundance
patterns of subject number 85 and 69, each of which rich in E. coli proteins relative to all identified proteins clustered
together. The corresponding Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.911
(Supporting Information Figure S-8). In
conclusion, using 96FASP for the proteomic analysis of urinary pellets
permitted the identification of pathogenic bacteria in urine. Quantitative
protein profiles integrating human urinary and microbial proteins
may be helpful to associate the presence of a specific infectious
agent with the local immune response in the urinary tract. A metaproteomic
approach aimed at discerning UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria was
also previously reported.9

Figure 4 (A) Urinary pellets from
five human subjects with potential urinary
tract infections were analyzed by 96FASP and label free quantitation
(LFQ). About 340 proteins were quantified in all five subjects and
were used in the plot. (B) Heat map presenting differentially expressed
proteins on the basis of LFQ-based quantitation from eight urine concentrate
(UC) samples used in a Type 1 diabetes (T1D) project. About 1143 proteins
were quantified by LFQ in at least one LC-MS replicate of the eight
samples, and were used in the plot. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering
generated two clusters. Each set of LC-MS replicates (run1 and run2)
for a given sample clustered together. The data shows that, using
highly parallel urine sample processing by 96FASP followed by shotgun
proteomic analysis, quantitative protein profiles from technical replicates
can be easily discerned from those originating from different human
donors. P, T1D patient; C, control.

Measuring Differences in Urinary Proteome Profiles Using 96FASP
To contrast the high repeatability of technical replicates from
a single UC sample with the considerable variability of urinary protein
profiles derived from different human subjects, eight UC samples were
prepared from a cohort related to a juvenile T1D project. Four specimens
each belonged to the T1D and healthy sibling control cohorts. The
purpose of the experiment was not to demonstrate that T1D biomarkers
can be identified; rather, the intent was to show that urine samples
analyzed by 96FASP and LC-MS followed by LFQ quantification result
in protein abundance patterns clearly discerning the individuals from
each other. Two LC-MS replicates were run for each sample. The numbers
of protein identifications were 1247 and 1335 proteins on average
for the T1D and healthy control cohort, respectively. Performing unsupervised
hierarchical clustering (Figure 4B), all of
the technical replicate sets cluster with each other. The Pearson
correlation coefficients were much lower for LFQ data comparing different
samples (R = 0.465 ± 0.185, n = 28) than for LC-MS replicates (R = 0.966 ±
0.017, n = 8). However, as recently reported, intraindividual
variability in the urinary proteome can be high and presents additional
challenges for a biomarkers discovery effort using urine.47 This pilot study supports the notion that 96FASP,
used in conjunction with a robust LC-MS method, is a credible approach
to improve sample throughput without sacrificing data quality for
a large-scale biomarker discovery project using urine.

Conclusion
Recently, Switzar et al.30 published
data processing protein samples of a HEK293T cell lysate in 96-well
plates for shotgun proteomic analysis. We modified this method assessing
its performance with a clinically relevant body fluid, quantitatively
analyzed experimental repeatability including well-to-well and plate-to-plate
variability, addressed questions of centrifugal speed and protein
load capacity (loading range of 10–70 μg total protein)
and applied the method to urinary pellets, a valuable sample source
for UTI diagnostics. The method was successfully used to identify
microbial species from several UP samples. Furthermore, a pilot project
revealed a high level of clustering of quantitative urinary proteomic
data derived from technical replicates. This was not the case when
urine samples from different human subjects, including siblings, were
compared. The experiments revealed the potential of the 96FASP urine
sample processing to become a gold standard for high-throughput sample
preparation in quantitative clinical proteomics investigations. Urine
is collected noninvasively yielding plenty of protein,48 can reveal evidence of renal and urogenital
diseases49 and diseases anatomically distant
from the kidneys and urogenital tract. Examples are coronary artery
disease,50 acute appendicitis,51 preeclampsia,52 and
Kawasaki disease.53 The complexity of the
human urinary proteome, the extensive post-translational processing
of its proteins, the interindividual and intraindividual variability
of protein content based on diet, exercise, sexual activity, and microbial
colonization also render biomarker discovery projects more challenging
than other sample sources.5,47,48 Good disease and control cohort definitions, thorough metadata collection,
efficient sample processing and the availability of large cohorts
offer the best opportunities to discover and validate useful biomarkers.48 The 96FASP method will contribute to such efforts,
and its application is not limited to urine but includes other body
fluids, extracellular matrix, complex tissues, and tumors.
