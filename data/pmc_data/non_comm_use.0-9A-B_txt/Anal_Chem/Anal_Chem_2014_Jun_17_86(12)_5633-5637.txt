Advances in metabolomics, particularly
for research on cancer,
have increased the demand for accurate, highly sensitive methods for
measuring glutamine (Gln) and glutamic acid (Glu) in cell cultures
and other biological samples. N-terminal Gln and Glu residues in proteins
or peptides have been reported to cyclize to pyroglutamic acid (pGlu)
during liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS) analysis,
but cyclization of free Gln and Glu to free pGlu during LC-MS analysis
has not been well-characterized. Using an LC-MS/MS protocol that we
developed to separate Gln, Glu, and pGlu, we found that free Gln and
Glu cyclize to pGlu in the electrospray ionization source, revealing
a previously uncharacterized artifact in metabolomic studies. Analysis
of Gln standards over a concentration range from 0.39 to 200 μM
indicated that a minimum of 33% and maximum of almost 100% of Gln
was converted to pGlu in the ionization source, with the extent of
conversion dependent on fragmentor voltage. We conclude that the sensitivity
and accuracy of Gln, Glu, and pGlu quantitation by electrospray ionization-based
mass spectrometry can be improved dramatically by using (i) chromatographic
conditions that adequately separate the three metabolites, (ii) isotopic
internal standards to correct for in-source pGlu formation, and (iii)
user-optimized fragmentor voltage for acquisition of the MS spectra.
These findings have immediate impact on metabolomics and metabolism
research using LC-MS technologies.

==== Body
Glutamine (Gln) is a central
player in metabolic pathways and in many diseases. In the cancer research
community, for example, there is renewed interest in the various important
roles that Gln plays in both biology and therapy. It serves as (1)
a direct building block for protein synthesis; (2) a precursor for
synthesis of glutamic acid (Glu) by glutaminase;1 (3) a precursor for synthesis of asparagine by asparagine
synthetase;2 (4) a source of α-ketoglutarate,
which supports the tricarboxylic acid cycle and, therefore, energy
production in proliferating cancer cells;3−5 (5) a source
of carbon for fatty acid synthesis;6,7 (6) a precursor
for the antioxidant glutathione;8 (7) a
precursor for pyrimidine synthesis;9 (8)
a positive modulator of autophagy;10,11 and (9) a
proposed antacid.12 It is therefore important
to be able to measure free Gln concentrations accurately and with
high sensitivity. However, as we will describe, such measurements
of Gln and Glu are challenging.

Two potential causes of inaccurate
Gln and Glu measurements include
chemical derivatization and cyclization to pyroglutamic acid (pGlu).
Until very recently, amino acid concentrations have been measured
by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS) following chemical
derivatization, which can introduce artifacts.13 To circumvent that problem, we and others have developed
label-free, targeted approaches to amino acid analysis.14 Nevertheless, Gln can be cyclized to pGlu enzymatically
or nonenzymatically under acidic, alkaline, and/or high temperature
conditions.15−19 The process involves loss of the side-chain amide nitrogen as ammonia.
Like Gln, Glu can also be cyclized to pGlu, enzymatically by glutaminyl
cyclase (QPCT in humans) in a process that involves loss of the side
chain hydroxyl group as water.19−26

Despite the suggestion that pGlu is only a degradation product,
it has several important biological functions: (1) being a glutamate
analogue and a potential precursor, it has been studied as an agonist
of glutamate in brain-related research,27 (2) it provides resistance to protein degradation by amino peptidases,22 (3) it has been shown to be involved in synthesis
of neurotransmitters in neuronal cells,28 and (4) it has been shown to have an antidiabetic effect in type-2
diabetes in rats and mice.29 When we tried
to measure free Gln and Glu in enzyme kinetic reactions with l-asparaginase30 and in cancer cells by
liquid chromatography (LC)-MS,14,31 we were surprised to
detect significant levels of free pGlu. When we began monitoring pGlu
more closely, we found high levels of pGlu in Gln and Glu standards,
an unexpected observation that prompted us to determine the source
of the pGlu.

Our investigation into the source of pGlu next
led us to use Fourier
Transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) to ascertain that the Gln and Glu standards were nearly 100%
pure, suggesting that the pGlu was generated during the analytical
process. To test whether the liquid chromatography (LC) conditions
(e.g., mobile phase acidity) were responsible for pGlu formation,
we performed direct injection (flow injection analysis, FIA) of Gln
and Glu standards in water. Those analyses revealed significant levels
of free pGlu, suggesting that the LC conditions were not responsible
for the observed pGlu. Finally, we found that pGlu was generated from
Gln and Glu in the ion source of the mass spectrometer. Importantly,
we conclude that accurate measurement of free Gln, Glu, and pGlu by
mass spectrometry requires chromatographic separation of the three
species to differentiate between pGlu present naturally and that generated
from Gln and Glu in the ion source. A further increase in measurement
accuracy can be obtained by optimizing MS ionization source conditions
to minimize in-source loss of Gln or Glu to pGlu. The LC-MS/MS method
used in this study achieved those goals. We used multiple reaction
monitoring (MRM) transitions specific to each metabolite and chromatographic
conditions that separate them. In addition, we used isotopic internal
standards and analyzed electrospray ionization (ESI) source parameters
to identify conditions that minimize the cyclization reaction.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Gln, Glu, pGlu, 13C5,15N2-Gln, and 13C5,15N-Glu were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
LC/MS grade water, methanol, and acetonitrile (ACN) were purchased
from Honeywell Burdick and Jackson (Muskegon, MI). Formic acid and
heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.

Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry
Liquid
chromatography was performed on an Agilent 1290 Infinity UHPLC system
equipped with a Zorbax SB C-18 column (3.0 × 100 mm, 1.8 μm
particle size; Agilent) at 25 °C column temperature. Mobile phase
consisted of (A) water and (B) ACN each containing 0.3% HFBA and 0.5%
formic acid. Gradient conditions were: 0.01 to 2 min = 2% to 30% B;
2 to 4.1 min = 30% to 40.0% B; 4.1 to 4.8 min = 40% to 45% B; 4.8
to 4.9 min = 45% to 90% B; 4.9 to 5.5 min = 90% B; 5.5 to 5.6 min
= 90% to 2% B; 5.6 to 8.0 min = 2% B. Injection volume was 5.0 μL,
and flow rate was 0.3 mL/min. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on an
Agilent 6460 triple quadrupole equipped with a jet stream ESI source.
MRM was performed in the positive ion mode. Other MS parameters included:
gas temperature at 300 °C, drying gas at 7 L/min, nebulizer pressure
at 50 psi, sheath gas temperature at 325 °C, sheath gas flow
at 10 L/min, capillary voltage (CV) at 3750 V, dwell time of 20 ms,
and nozzle voltage (NV) at 0 V. The MRM transitions and optimized
source conditions (Mass Hunter Optimizer B.04.01) used were: (i) for
Glu: 148.1 > 84.1 and 148.1 > 56.1, collision energy (CE) 14
V, fragmentor
voltage (FV) 74 V, and cell accelerator voltage (CAV) 7 V; (ii) for
Gln: 147.1 > 84.1 and 147.1 > 56.1, CE 10 V, FV 76 V, and CAV
7 V;
and (iii) for pGlu: 130.0 > 84.1 and 130.0 > 56.1, CE 10 V,
FV 100
V, and CAV 7 V.

Mass Hunter (version B.04.01) was used for data
acquisition. Mass Hunter Qualitative analysis and Quantitative analysis
were used for data processing. Ten μM 13C5,15N2-Gln (Sigma) and 13C5,15N-Glu (Sigma) were used as internal standards. The
corresponding MRM transitions and optimized source conditions were:
(i) for 13C5,15N2-Gln:
154.1 > 89.1, CE 10 V, FV 78 V, and CAV 7 V; and (ii) for 13C5,15N-Glu: 154.1 > 89.1, CE 10
V, FV 80 V,
and CAV 7 V.

Flow Injection Analysis (FIA) and Selected Ion Monitoring (SIM)
FIA was performed using 1.0 mM Gln in water to assess whether cyclization
of Gln to pGlu occurred in the sample, during chromatography (e.g.,
due to acidity of the mobile phase), or inside the ion source. SIM
was performed on nonlabeled and isotopically labeled Gln and Glu standards
using FIA in positive ion mode to determine the extent of cyclization.
Gln, Glu, and pGlu chemical standards were additionally subjected
to FT-IR and NMR analysis to confirm the absence of pGlu in the original,
powder-form Gln and Glu standards.

Effect of MS Parameters
on Cyclization of Gln and Glu to pGlu
MS signal intensities
(SI) for various concentrations of standard
Gln and Glu (0.39–200 μM) were monitored using the LC-MS/MS
method described above with modification of source conditions, such
as CV 1500–5500 V, NV 500–1500 V, nebulizer pressure
10–50 psi, FV 10–200 V, and various sheath gas/gas temperature
combinations 200–300 °C. SI of both Gln/Glu and pGlu formed
in-source from Gln/Glu were measured. The ratio of peak areas (SI
of pGlu from Gln: SI of Gln) was calculated for each condition.

In-Source Cyclization of Gln and Glu to pGlu in Orbitrap
The LC-MS system consisted of a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UPLC coupled
to an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Standards
of Gln, Glu, and pGlu (100 μM) were injected onto a Phenomenex
Kinetex C18 XB core–shell column (2.6 μm × 2.1 mm
× 150 mm), and metabolites were separated using a 10 min program:
0 to 5 min = 100% A (water with 0.1% formic acid); 5 to 10 min = 0
to 100% B (ACN with 0.1% formic acid). The injection volume was 6
μL, and the flow rate was 200 μL/min. Metabolites were
detected in positive ion mode with the m/z range calibrated and set at 50–1000 Da, acquisition
time of 10 ms, and resolution set at 60,000. The Gln, Glu, and pGlu
(100 μM) standards were also analyzed on an LC-MS system consisting
of a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UPLC coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion mass
spectrometer with a heated ESI source (Thermo Scientific). The source
fragmentation voltage parameter for all metabolomic analyses on the
Orbitrap instruments was set at zero. The source fragmentation voltage
settings were also tested in the Orbitrap Elite instrument from 0
to 60 V (10 V increments).

Results and Discussion
LC-MS/MS
to Characterize In-Source Cyclization of Gln to pGlu
While
trying to measure Gln and Glu concentrations in kinetic studies
and experiments with cultured cells, we found significant pGlu and
asked whether it was actually a constituent of the sample or whether
it had formed by cyclization of Gln or Glu during the measurement
process. The method described here enabled us to make that distinction.
Central to the method is an LC protocol we developed that efficiently
separates Gln, Glu, and pGlu (Figure 1). That
separation allowed us to differentiate pGlu present in the sample
from products of cyclization of Gln or Glu in the ESI source. Using
that method, we found that pGlu measurement based on accurate mass
alone can lead to erroneous results. Direct injection (flow injection
analysis, FIA) performed with selected ion monitoring (SIM) of Gln
in water revealed that cyclization to pGlu occurred even without a
chromatographic step (Figure S-1, Supporting Information) and, notably, in the absence of the acidic LC mobile phase which
was previously implicated in pGlu formation in peptides.15 Those results suggested that ESI source conditions
were responsible for Gln cyclization to pGlu. Independent FT-IR and
NMR analyses confirmed that pGlu was not present in the Gln and Glu
standards prior to exposure to the ESI source (data not shown).

and water loss, respectively. (B) MRMs of Glu, Gln, and pGlu from
an equimolar mix of Glu, Gln, and pGlu standards (1 mM) showing the
“in-source” formation of pGlu from Gln and Glu. The
MS spectra were acquired using the optimal conditions for each analyte
as described in the Experimental Section.

SIM of pGlu from Unlabeled and Labeled Gln
and Glu
To determine whether isotopically labeled Gln and
Glu undergo the
same extent of cyclization to pGlu as nonlabeled Gln and Glu, we performed
selected ion monitoring (SIM) with labeled and nonlabeled Gln and
Glu. SIM analysis revealed that a nearly equal fraction of Gln cyclizes
to pGlu in the ion source for both the isotope-labeled and nonlabeled
species. The peak area ratio for pGlu/Gln was 0.405, and the peak
area ratio for labeled pGlu/labeled Gln was 0.412 (Figure S-1, Supporting Information); the same was true for
Glu (data not shown). Hence, Gln and Glu labeled with stable isotope
are suitable as internal standards for correction of in-source pGlu
formation and accurate quantitation of Gln and Glu. Importantly, because
cyclization to pGlu appears to be a first order process under constant
source conditions, external and/or internal calibration allows accurate
quantitation of Gln (or Glu) because the fraction of pGlu produced
is constant over the range of concentrations measured. These findings
are of importance to laboratories using MS-based assays for quantitating
Gln, Glu, and/or pGlu.

Effect of MS Parameters on In-Source Cyclization
of Gln and
Glu to pGlu
No change in the extent of conversion of Gln
to pGlu in-source was observed when we varied ion source conditions
such as CV (1500 to 5500 V), NV (500 to 1500 V), nebulizer pressure
(10 to 50 psi), or various sheath gas/gas temperature combinations
(200 to 300 °C). However, FV (a parameter that controls the speed
at which ions pass through a medium pressure capillary between the
electrospray chamber and the mass spectrometer; 10 to 200 V) markedly
influenced the extent of conversion of Gln to pGlu in-source, suggesting
that collision induced dissociation (CID) may be involved in its formation.
The peak ratio of pGlu (from Gln) to Gln ranged from ∼0.4 to
0.8 at FV 10 to 100 V. When we increased the FV above 100 V, that
ratio increased dramatically to ∼4.5 or greater (Figure 2A,B). No quantifiable signal was observed for Gln
at FV above 120 V; only pGlu was detected in that range of fragmentor
voltages (Figure 2B).

Figure 2 (A) Effect of fragmentor
voltage (FV) on peak ratio (signal intensity
of pGlufrom Gln/signal intensity of Gln) at different
concentrations of Gln (0.39–200 μM). Peak ratio increased
on increasing FV above 100 V. Gln signal was not quantifiable above
FV 120 V. (B) MRM traces acquired using 200 μM Gln at FV 76
V (optimal for Gln), FV 120 V, and FV 200 V, illustrating the loss
of Gln signal as FV is increased above 100 V.

In-Source Cyclization of Gln and Glu to pGlu in Orbitrap
Extracted ion chromatogram (XIC; MS1 of Orbitrap Elite) analyses
of Gln, Glu, and pGlu standards also showed that pGlu was formed from
Gln and Glu in the ion source due to cyclization of Gln and Glu with
loss of ammonia and water, respectively, as indicated by parent mass
conversion (Figure S-2, Supporting Information). Extracted ion chromatogram (XIC; MS1 of Orbitrap Fusion) analyses
of Gln, Glu, and pGlu standards further confirmed that pGlu was formed
from Gln and Glu in the ion source (data not shown). Source fragmentation
voltage settings tested in the Orbitrap Elite instrument from 0 to
60 V (10 V increments) yielded similar conversion ratios of Gln to
pGlu from 0 to 30 V (approximately 60–70% conversion). However,
at 40 V and higher, the overall intensity of both Gln and pGlu dramatically
declined with subsequent appearance of a fragment at 84.01 m/z, which corresponded to in-source fragmentation
of the molecules. Therefore, we recommend that the source fragmentation
voltage be set at 0–10 V for metabolomic analyses of Gln or
Glu by Orbitrap instruments and isotopic correction for the pGlu formed
from Gln or Glu in the MS.

Conclusions
We
have identified and characterized a problem associated with
MS-based quantitation of the metabolically central amino acids Gln
and Glu. Free Gln and Glu can cyclize to pGlu inside the MS, causing
erroneous measurement of Gln, Glu, and pGlu. The in-source cyclization
to pGlu can be almost 100% for Gln, depending on the ionization source
conditions of the instrument. Achieving adequate chromatographic separation
of Gln, Glu, and pGlu allowed us to distinguish in-solution (i.e.,
endogenous) pGlu from that formed from Gln and Glu inside the ion
source. We propose that quantitation of Gln, Glu, and/or pGlu in biological
samples should be performed using (i) chromatographic conditions that
adequately separate the three metabolites, (ii) isotopic internal
standards to correct for in-source pGlu formation, and (iii) user-optimized
fragmentor voltage for use in acquiring the MS spectra. These findings
have immediate impact on metabolomics and metabolism research using
MS technologies.
