Toxoplasmosis,
while often an asymptomatic parasitic disease in
healthy individuals, can cause severe complications in immunocompromised
persons and during pregnancy. The most common method to diagnose Toxoplasma gondii infections is the serological determination
of antibodies directed against parasite protein antigens. Here we
report the use of a bead-based multiplex assay containing a synthetic
phosphoglycan portion of the Toxoplasma gondii glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI1) for the detection of GPI1-specific
antibodies in human sera. The glycan was conjugated to beads at the
lipid site to retain its natural orientation and its immunogenic groups.
We compared the response against GPI1 with that against
the protein antigen SAG1, a common component of commercial serological
assays, via the detection of parasite-specific human IgG and IgM antibodies,
respectively. The GPI1-based test is in excellent agreement
with the results for the commercial ELISA, as the ROC analysis of
the GPI1 test shows 97% specificity and 98% sensitivity
for the assay. GPI1 was a more reliable predictor for
a parasite-specific IgM response compared to SAG1, indicating that
a bead-based multiplex assay using GPI1 in combination
with SAG1 may strengthen Toxoplasma gondii serology,
in particular in seroepidemiological studies.

==== Body
Around one-third
of the world’s
population is chronically infected by Toxoplasma gondii, a globally distributed apicomplexan parasite that infects all warm
blooded animals.1 Humans get infected with T. gondii mainly by ingesting raw or undercooked meat from
infected animals, by food contaminated with T. gondii oocysts,2 and rarely by organ transplants
from infected individuals.3 Generally, T. gondii infections in healthy individuals are asymptomatic
or induce only mild flu-like symptoms. In immunocompromised individuals T. gondii infections can lead to serious complications such
as toxoplasmic encephalitis and/or ocular toxoplasmosis resulting
in blindness if not treated.4 Importantly,
during pregnancy, a primary infection with T. gondii can lead to transmission of the parasites from mother to child,
causing physical or mental retardation of the infant or even induce
abortion.4

T. gondii infections are primarily diagnosed by
serological detection of IgM and IgG antibodies, and in some cases
IgA, directed against parasitic protein antigens.5 Commercial assays rely on antigens derived from whole T. gondii lysate, purified from parasites grown in mice
or cell culture, or from recombinant sources.6,7 Antibodies
are detected primarily by immunochemical methods such as enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), but indirect fluorescent antibody test
(IFAT), immunosorbent agglutination assay (ISAGA), modified agglutination
tests (MAT), or indirect hemagglutination assays (IHA) have also been
used.7 These methods cannot estimate the
time point of the initial infection. In pregnant women, the presence
of IgM antibodies may mark a recently acquired, acute infection. In
this case, additional tests for IgG and IgM avidity may be essential
to determine whether the infection occurred in a seronegative mother
after conception (primary infection). Thus, multiple assays are often
used to confirm the infection but might also call for several confirmatory
tests by specialized diagnostic laboratories,8 requiring a larger volume of sera to be collected. In the case of
large-scale seroepidemiological studies access to serum is limited,
in particular from small children and in developing countries.9−11 Determination of IgG and/or IgM responses against several pathogens
is desirable and also sufficient to obtain estimates of prevalence
of acute and chronic infections. Therefore, assay formats allowing
a parallel determination of multiple analytes are ideal for these
studies.

Bead-based multiplex assays (BBMAs) are high throughput
methods
for the simultaneous detection and quantification of multiple analytes
and samples.12 BBMAs use color-coded beads
that carry the antigen of interest. By addition of serum samples,
specific antibodies bind to the bead-coupled antigen, which are detected
using a secondary, fluorescence-labeled detection antibody (Figure 1a). A reader with
two detection channels separates the beads according to color code
and detects the intensity of the fluorescent label on the secondary
antibody, respectively. This method is faster and requires less sample
than conventional methods to detect specific antibodies.

Figure 1 Detection of
glycosylphosphatidylinositols of T. gondii parasites.
(a) Symbolic representation of the detection of anti-GPI
antibodies using the BBMA. (b) Chemical representation showing the
variations of T. gondii’s GPIs.

Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) are complex glycolipids
on
the cell surface of eukaryotes that are present either in protein-free
form or used to anchor proteins to the cell membrane. Two main GPI
glycoforms are present on the surface of T. gondii, a free GPI also known as the low molecular weight antigen (GPI1),13 and GPI2 that
anchors proteins such as surface antigen SAG1 to the parasite membrane
(Figure 1).14,15 Synthetic GPI glycans fixed on array surfaces can be used to detect
IgG and IgM anti-GPI antibodies in sera from infected individuals
and to differentiate acute and latent toxoplasmosis infections.16

Here we report the use of a synthetic
GPI-glycan conjugated to
color-coded magnetic beads to detect anti-GPI1 antibodies
using a BBMA. This high-throughput method can simultaneously detect
anti-SAG1 and anti-GPI1 antibodies with diagnostic value
for toxoplasmosis and enable large-scale seroepidemiological studies.17 Furthermore, our data show that comparing IgM
responses directed against SAG1 and GPI1 could allow
the discrimination between acute and postacute/latent infections.

Materials
and Methods
Serum Panel of Human Sera and Reference Measurements for Analysis
of Anti-T. gondii Antibodies
Serum samples
of anonymous donors were taken from a large collection of human sera
from the 1980s. These sera were obtained during routine serosurveillance
studies performed in the former German Democratic Republic (now in
possession of the Robert Koch-Institute) and known to possess a high
proportion (>50%) of sera positive for anti-T. gondii antibodies.18 These sera were sampled
each year in 4–5 government districts (out of 15), collecting
150–200 samples from 10 age groups (0 to >60 years). Sera
were
heat inactivated. No further data are available. It has been shown
that even old sera still perform very well in serology, including
testing for T. gondii.19,20 Out of this
collection, random samples were picked and analyzed for the presence
of anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies using a commercial
ELISA kit (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany) following the supplier’s
instructions. These sera are referred to as population-based panel
(PBP) sera. In addition, human sera from infected individuals tested
positive for anti-T. gondii IgM/IgG by routine diagnosis
using the VIDAS TOXO IgM or IgG (bioMérieux) enzyme-linked
fluorescent immunoassays (ELIFA), scored positive using the manufacturer’s
recommended value for IgM (≥0.65) or a cutoff value of 8 IU/mL
for IgG, were included. These sera were classified as follows: (i)
acute (1–3 months postinfection (pi); high IgM concentrations
and/or presence of IgA antibodies and/or low IgG avidity and/or IFA
≥ 1:1024), n = 7; (ii) postacute (>3 months
pi; IgG avidity high and/or IFA < 1:1024), n =
3; (iii) latent infection with IgM persistence (low IgM concentrations
or proven previous infection >2 years, and/or high IgG avidity,
and/or
IFA < 1:1024), n = 6. No ethical clearance was
necessary because these serum samples were obtained for routine diagnosis
and used here without personalized data. Reference sera 13/13221 and 01/60022 were
used for quantification of anti-T. gondii IgG in
international units (IU) and were obtained from the National Institute
for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC), UK.

Synthetic GPI
Phosphoglycan from T. gondii
The phosphoglycan
part of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI1) from T. gondii was synthesized following
established protocols.23,24 A phosphate-alkyl-thiol linker
replacing the natural phospholipid was installed at the O-1 position
of myo-inositol and used for conjugation of the GPI1 glycan
to MagPlex beads modified with a maleimide (see below).

Glycan Microarray
Detection of Anti-GPI Antibodies Using Microarrays
Glycans
were dissolved (final concentration of 250 μM) in
phosphate buffer pH 7.4 including 250 μM of TCEP. The compounds
were robotically printed onto sciCHIP epoxy glass slides using the
piezoelectric spotting device S3 (Scienion) at 50% relative humidity
and 23 °C. The preparation and analysis of sera were performed
according to previously established protocols.16 In brief, each serum sample was diluted 1:15 with PBS (pH
7.4) containing 0.1% v/v Tween 20 and 3% w/v BSA and incubated at
37 °C for 15 min to dissolve potential lipid aggregates. The
microarrays were blocked with BSA (2.5%, w/v) in PBS for 1 h at room
temperature, washed twice with PBS and water, and dried by centrifugation
(3 min, 300g). The sera were added to the microarrays
and deposited in a sealed humidified incubator for 1 h at room temperature.
Unbound sample components were removed with a series of washes with
0.1% (1×) and twice with 0.001% v/v Tween 20 in PBS. The microarrays
were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with ALEXA-Fluor594 goat
antihuman-IgM antibody (μ-chain specific form; Life Technologies)
or ALEXA-Fluor488 antihuman-IgG antibody (Fcγ specific, from
Dianova) diluted 1:400 in PBS containing 0.1% v/v Tween 20 and 3%
w/v BSA. The slides were washed (1×) with PBS (pH 7.4) containing
0.1% v/v Tween 20 and 3% w/v BSA, PBS (1×), and water (1×)
and subsequently dried by centrifugation (5 min, 300g). The slides were analyzed using a fluorescence microarray scanner
(Genepix 4300A, Molecular Devices) using a PMT gain that saturated
the highest signals to a minimum amount to ensure reproducibility.
All analyzed spots were manually adjusted and the “mean fluorescence
values – background” was used for analysis.

Modification
of MagPlex Microspheres
Carboxyl-functionalized
MagPlex magnetic microspheres of region 20 (Luminex) were modified
with a N-propylaminomaleimide linker using the method
described in the xMAP reference book.25 Briefly, 100 μL of the stock suspension (approximately 1.25
× 106 beads) of carboxyl-functionalized microspheres
were centrifuged and separated. The microspheres were resuspended
in 500 μL of 0.1 M 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic
acid (MES) buffer pH 6.0, vortexed, sonicated for 20 s, and pelleted
with a magnet. The supernatant was removed, the beads were resuspended
in 100 μL of 0.1 M MES, pH 6.0, containing 1 mg/mL of N-propylaminomaleimide (see SI for preparation), and 50 μL of a 10 mg/mL EDC solution (freshly
prepared in 0.1 M MES, pH 6.0) was added. The microspheres were incubated
for 2 h under continuous mixing at room temperature. The reaction
was quenched by addition of 250 μL of 0.1 M MES, pH 4.5, and
mixing. The beads were pelleted, the supernatant was removed and the
microspheres were washed twice with 250 μL of 0.1 M MES, pH
4.5. Finally, the microspheres were resuspended in 250 μL of
0.1 M MES, pH 4.5, and stored at 4 °C in the dark or used immediately
for the coupling of the thiol linked glycan.

Coupling of Glycans to
the Maleimide-Coupled MagPlex Beads
The glycan disulfides
were reduced by treatment with 1.1 equiv
of resin-bound tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP, Sigma-Aldrich)
in 0.1 M PBS buffer (0.1M sodium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl , pH 7.0).
The resin was removed, and the solution was lyophilized. Maleimide-modified
beads (1.25 × 106 microspheres) were washed with 0.1
M PBS and resuspended in 100 μL of the same buffer. A 50 μg
amount of the freshly reduced GPI1 glycan was dissolved
in 100 mM Tris buffer pH 7.4. The GPI1 solution was added
to the beads, and the final volume was adjusted to 250 μL with
100 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4. The reaction mixture was incubated at
room temperature in darkness. After 1 h, the microspheres were pelleted
and the supernatant was removed. The unreacted maleimide groups were
quenched by addition of 100 μL of a 50 mM l-cysteine
hydrochloride solution in 100 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4. After 1 h, the
microspheres were pelleted, washed twice with 100 μL of 0.1
M PBS containing 1% BSA, and stored in 250 μL of 0.1 M PBS–TBN
buffer at 4 °C.

Determination of the GPI1 Coupling
Efficacy to
MagPlex Beads
GPI-beads (5 × 105) were washed
with water and hydrolyzed using 200 μL of 2 M TFA for 4 h at
100 °C. The hydrolysis mixture was lyophilized, and the remainder
was dissolved in 100 mL of water and analyzed on a CarboPac PA20 column
(3 × 150 mm, Dionex) using a high-performance anion exchange
chromatography system coupled with a pulsed amperometer detector (HPAE-PAD,
Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). The monosaccharides were separated using isocratic
10 mM NaOH (J.T. Baker, Devneter, The Netherlands) at 0.5 mL/min flow
rate for 15 min at 30 °C. The quantity of GPI was calculated
based on the content of glucose in the injected samples. The amount
of glucose was determined using a calibration curve between 0 to 400
pmol of the monosaccharide standards galactosamine, glucosamine, and
glucose (Sigma).

Coupling of Antihuman IgG, Human Serum Albumin
(HSA), and SAG1
Protein to MagPlex Beads
Carboxyl-functionalized MagPlex
beads (1.5 × 106 microspheres) of regions 7 and 15
were transferred to an Eppendorf tube (LoBind), washed with 100 μL
of water, resuspended in 80 μL of 100 mM NaH2PO4 buffer pH 6.2, mixed, and sonicated for 20 s. Sulfo-NHS (10
μL of 50 mg/mL) and EDC (10 μL of 50 mg/mL) were added,
and the reaction mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature
under gentle mixing. The microspheres were separated and resuspended
in 100 μL of 50 mM MES pH 5.0 buffer and washed twice with the
same buffer. The activated microspheres were resuspended in 100 μL
of 50 mM MES buffer and sonicated for 20 s, and then 20 μg of
the corresponding protein, human serum albumin (HSA, Sigma-Aldrich)
or antihuman IgG (Fcγ specific, Dianova), was added. The volume
was adjusted to 500 μL with 50 mM MES buffer, and the reaction
mixture was incubated for 2 h under mixing by rotation at room temperature.
The beads were separated, washed once with 500 μL and twice
with 1 mL of PBS–TBN buffer (PBS pH 7.3, 0.1% w/v BSA, 0.02%
v/v Tween 20, 0.05% w/v sodium azide), and finally stored in 500 μL
of the same buffer at 4 °C. Coupling of T. gondii SAG1 protein (recombinantly expressed and purified in E.
coli as described26 but in biotinylated
form) was performed via biotin binding to recombinant streptavidin
(AnaSpec, Fremont, CA), which had been coupled to beads of region
33 (25 μg) as described above. To this aim, a complete batch
of SA-coupled beads was suspended in 100 μL of PBS/BSA (0.1%)
to which 10 μg of SAG1 was added. The beads were incubated subsequently
for 1 h at room temperature in a mixer at 600 rpm, washed twice with
PBS/BSA (0.1%), and resuspended in 500 μL of PBS/BSA. After
coupling, all beads were counted using a counting chamber and adjusted
to a concentration of 1000 beads/μL.

Detection of Anti-GPI Antibodies
Using the Bead-Based Multiplex
Immunoassay
Successful determination of anti-GPI antibodies
was first evaluated by incubation of the loaded beads with T. gondii-positive reference sera, namely the fourth IS
WHO international standard 13/132 (containing 320 IU/mL anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies) and the WHO International Standard
anti-T. gondii IgG 01/600 (containing 20 IU/mL).
The immunoassays were performed in 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One)
following recommendations in the xMAP cookbook for serological assay.25 For quantification, the international standard
13/132 was used at a 1:4 dilution series starting at a 1:200 dilution
in PBS pH 7.3, 1% BSA (PBS-B) assay buffer (seven dilutions total
including a negative control containing assay buffer only) while all
sera were tested at a 1:200 dilution. The multiplex bead mix consisted
of 1000 beads per bead region per well in 50 μL of assay buffer.
First, 50 μL of the diluted standard and sera and 50 μL
of bead mix were added per well (GPI1 (region 20), SAG1
(region 33), antihuman IgG (region 15) and HSA (region 7)). The plate
was incubated protected from light for 1 h at room temperature under
constant shaking at 600 rpm. Next, the beads were washed with 2 ×
200 μL of PBS-T (0.1% Tween 20) washing buffer using a magnetic
plate washer (Tecan HydroSpeed). To detect the bound antibodies, 100
μL of R-phycoerythrin (PE)-coupled AffinityPure
goat antihuman IgG, Fcγ fragment specific or goat antihuman
IgM, Fc5μ fragment specific (both diluted to 1 μg/mL in
assay buffer, both from Dianova) was added, and the mixture was incubated
protected from light for 60 min as before. Subsequently, the beads
were washed with 3 × 200 μL of washing buffer and resuspended
in 120 μL/well assay buffer before analysis using a Bio-Plex
200 system at normal detector gain. The mean fluorescence intensity
(mfi) values for each sample and for each microsphere in each well were determined using the Bio-Plex Manager
6.1 software. Further data analysis was performed as described below
(see Data Analysis).

Data Analysis
All data analyses (plotting, quantification,
and statistical analyses) were performed using the open source statistics
software R (version 3.5.1)27 in conjunction
with the following packages. Data from the Bio-Plex 200 were exported
to Microsoft Excel for subsequent import to R using the package readxl which is contained within the tidyverse package. A second Excel file containing metadata, such as plate
layout and concentrations of the standard 13/132 for quantification,
was also imported to R and merged in a data frame suited for subsequent
analysis using the package drLumi.28 Here a standard curve was generated for serum 13/132 using
a five-parameter nonlinear regression curve fit of the mfi values
over international units with the negative control (buffer only) set
as constraint. Subsequently, the absolute concentration of reactivity
of the tested sera was expressed in international units by calculation
using this standard curve. To determine the agreement between the
results obtained by the multiplex assay and the reference methods,
the linear regression was calculated between the log-transformed values
of the quantified sera. The positive and negative control beads were
used to exclude sera not fulfilling a quality control check (background
binding to HSA beads below 500 mfi (negative control) and binding
to antihuman IgG beads above 10 000 mfi (positive control))
from the analysis (83 sera were analyzed). A receiver−operator
curve was constructed using the pROC package.29 All plots were generated using the ggplot2 package contained within the tidyverse package.
Finally, the agreement between the multiplex assay and a reference
ELISA for a small panel of IgM positive sera (n =
20) was determined by calculating the Pearson’s correlation
coefficient between the ELISA data (either expressed in IU/mL or IgM
index) and the mfi data. Visualization of Figure 2 was performed with Prism 7 (GrapPad).

Results
Preparation of Glycans
and Linkers
The glycan portions
of GPI1 and the mannose 3 were synthesized
on milligram scale following established protocols.23,24 To conjugate the glycans to the carboxylate beads via a thiol, an N-propylaminomaleimide (NPM) linker 5 was prepared
in 80% yield and two steps: coupling of maleimide 4 with
3-(Boc-amino)-1-propanol using Mitsunobu conditions (SI)30 followed by Boc-group removal
using TFA (Scheme 1).

and conditions: (a)
BocHN-(CH2)3-OH, PPh3, DIAD, THF,

(c) MagPlex microspheres region 020, EDC, MES buffer pH 6.0; (d) i.
TCEP, PBS buffer pH 7.0, ii. Tris buffer pH 7.4

Preparation of Glycan–Bead Conjugates
To establish
the best conditions for glycan conjugation, carboxylated MagPlex microspheres
(5 × 105 beads) were modified with 100 μL of
linker 5 at 0.06, 0.16, 0.32, 0.65, and 1.30 mM followed
by reaction with 1.30 mM Man 3. Determination of the
Man3 conjugation efficiency with a solution of FITC-labeled
concanavalin A, a lectin-binding mannose, showed an increase in fluorescence
for beads modified using between 6.5 and 65 nmol of the linker. Higher
amounts (130 nmol) did not increase the fluorescence intensity, indicating
saturation of the binding sites on the microspheres (Figure S1, SI). On the basis of this result, a 1 mg/mL (65
nmol/5 × 105 beads) solution of linker 5 was used in all further experiments to modify the microspheres.
Then the GPI1 glycan was conjugated using 10 μg
(6.6 nmol) of glycan/5 × 105 beads. Acid hydrolysis
of the GPI1 conjugate with TFA and further quantification
of glucose using a HPAE-PAD chromatographic system showed a coupling
of 770 pmol/106 (1.16 μg of GPI1/106) beads (SI). Analysis of a second
conjugation of GPI1 to the beads delivered a content
of 1.36 μg of GPI1/106 beads, confirming
the reproducibility of the conjugation and the determination.

Immunoreactivity
of Coupled Antigens
To test the applicability
of GPI1 coupled to magnetic beads for the detection of
toxoplasmosis serostatus, a dilution series of reference sera (starting
at 1:200 dilution), positive for T. gondii antibodies,
was incubated with the 4-plex assay components consisting of GPI1- and SAG1-loaded beads in addition to HSA- and antihuman
IgG-coupled beads (Figure 2a and 2b). Both WHO reference sera
were reactive against GPI1 and SAG1, with serum 13/132
exhibiting stronger binding to both antigens when compared to serum
01/600, which agrees with the higher content of T. gondii-specific antibodies. Binding to SAG1, the immunodominant antigen
during a T. gondii infection,31 was higher for both reference sera as compared to GPI1. However, GPI1 was also recognized by both
sera in a concentration-dependent manner and clearly above background
binding to HSA.

Comparison of Microarrays and Bead Assay
Previously,
we showed that GPI1 is a suitable antigen to detect acute
phase IgM antibodies in a microarray-based platform.16 Thus, we were interested to see whether those results could
be transferred to the BBMA. Detection of IgM antibodies using a microarray
and BBMA was performed with sera from 19 patients, acutely infected
with T. gondii. Correlation of the anti-GPI1 IgM
antibody binding levels showed an excellent agreement (linear regression R2 = 0.95) between both methods (Figure 2c).

Validation of GPI1 and
SAG1 Multiplex Assay Performance for
Serosurveys
Using the standardized conditions, 88 human sera,
previously characterized with a commercial ELISA that is based on
parasite lysate (PBP sera, see Materials and Methods), were evaluated using the GPI1–bead conjugate.
To compare the potency of GPI1 glycan against a protein
marker, determination of the serostatus using the BBMA assay was carried
out using recombinant SAG126,32 conjugated to beads
of region 33. Additionally, antihuman IgG and human serum albumin
(HSA) were included as positive and negative control beads, respectively,
and used to exclude results that did not meet the quality criteria
of mfi signals >10 000 (antihuman IgG beads) and mfi signals
<500 (HSA beads) in two independent experiments. Additionally,
results were only valid if at least 50 independent events could be
evaluated per bead region. Using a standard curve generated by fitting
a five-parameter nonlinear regression to a dilution series of the
WHO international reference standard 13/132, the binding to both SAG1
and GPI1 beads was expressed in international units (IU)
per mL and compared to the results obtained by the commercial ELISA
for 82 (SAG1) or 83 (GPI1) sera by linear regression
(Figure 2d and 2e). The serostatus determined by IgG ELISA and the
BBMA assay (R2 = 0.91 for SAG1; R2 = 0.66 for GPI1) was in very
good agreement.

On the basis of these data, the ability to discriminate
in PBP sera IgG-positive from -negative samples was determined for
both SAG1 and GPI1 by the multiplex assay in comparison
to the ELISA by receiver–operator curve (ROC) analysis. SAG1
allowed a perfect discrimination (area under curve = 1) between positive
and negative sera, while for GPI a clear separation (few false positive
or false negative samples) was possible (area under curve = 0.98).
Using a threshold of 20.6 IU/mL (95% CI 17.9—24.5), a maximum
sensitivity of 97.1% (95% CI 88.2—100) was reached at a specificity
of 98.0% (95% CI 91.8—100) for the analysis of IgG antibodies
with GPI1 as antigen (Figure 2f).

Analysis of Sera for IgM Antibodies
To compare the
BBMA results for both IgG and IgM with those from the reference measurements
performed by enzyme-linked fluorescent assay (ELIFA), a panel of 16
sera from IgM-positive patients infected with T. gondii was analyzed. Correlation analysis for the IgG response showed robust
and significant correlation between the ELIFA data (expressed in IU/mL)
and the multiplex mfi results (Figure 3a,b) with Pearson’s correlation coefficients
of 0.78 for SAG1 (p < 0.001) and 0.89 for the
GPI1-conjugate (p < 0.0001). Interestingly,
the correlation between the BBMA and ELIFA data for IgM measurement
was significantly higher for binding of acute sera to GPI1 beads (correlation coefficient of 0.9926, p = 0.0088),
while no correlation was detected between IgM against SAG1 and ELIFA
(Figure 3c). However,
IgM indices of sera from postacute/latent infections correlated very
well with IgM mfi against SAG1 determined by BBMA (Figure 3d; correlation coefficient
of 0.9232, p = 0.0038)). Although these data are
based on only a small number of sera, they showed a differential response
against the two defined antigens for discriminating very early from
later infections.

of 16 IgM-positive
sera. Bio-Plex readout (mfi) vs ELIFA readout (IU or index) are shown
for IgG response (a, b) or IgM response (c, d), and GPI1 beads (a,

experiments. Shaded areas indicate 95% CI.

Discussion
Protozoan parasites are characterized by the
presence of many free
and protein-attached GPIs on the surface of the cell membrane.33 These glycolipids are potent modulators of the
host immune system during infections and induce the production of
antiglycan antibodies.34T. gondii displays two GPIs on the cell membrane that differ by the presence
of a glucose unit in the glycan branch and the mode of presentation.
The GPI containing glucose, also known as the low molecular weight
antigen (LMWA), is found only as free glycolipid and is a strong activator
of the host immune system.13 Previously,
we demonstrated the presence of specific antibodies against this glycolipid
in sera from T. gondii-infected individuals that
can be used to determine the infection and the relevance of the glucose
residue for the differentiation of anti-GPI antibodies.23 Using the synthetic phosphoglycan GPI1 printed on microarrays and a set of reference sera a test was developed
to detect seropositive sera and to differentiate the acute and latent
stages of a T. gondii infection.16

To evaluate the potential of synthetic GPI1 for the
determination of the T. gondii serostatus in humans
using a BBMA, we first established the conjugation of the antigen
to carboxylate microspheres. Various strategies for coupling glycan
structures to carboxyl-functionalized beads have been described, e.g.,
via end-biotinylated ABO blood group glycans to streptavidin-coated
beads,35 by functionalization of pneumococcal
polysaccharides with 4-(4,6-dimethoxy[1,3,5]triazin-2-yl)-4-methyl-morpholinium
(DMTMM) before adding to beads,36 or more
classically by standard carbodiimide-based coupling protocols for
glycans with a terminal amine group.37−39 However, in the case
of GPI1, the free amine groups of glucosamine and phosphoethanolamine
are important for the specific binding of antibodies to GPIs.16,40 Thus, we selected a conjugation method using maleimide-activated
beads and reaction with a thiol linker that is attached at the phospho-myo-inositol
unit of GPI1 to retain the natural orientation of the
glycan. Initial conjugation of the maleimide beads with a test compound
(Man3) showed a concentration dependency and saturation
of the binding sites using 65 nmol of Man3 per 105 beads. Considering the complexity, value, and size of GPI1, this glycan was conjugated using 6.5 nmol/105 beads to get a loading of 1.1 μg of GPI1/106 beads. This loading was in line with the theoretical capacity
of the beads (108 active sites/bead) and was reproducible
between two different batches (SI).

Next, we established the use of the GPI1–bead
conjugate for anti-GPI antibodies detection using BBMA in three steps.
First, the detection of anti-GPI1 antibodies in the 13/132
and 01/600 WHO reference sera was used to determine the immunoreactivity
of the GPI-conjugate to distinguish seropositive samples. Then the
detection of anti-GPI antibodies by BBMA was compared with the detection
on microarrays using 19 characterized sera, and finally the BBMA was
compared with a commercial ELISA test using a larger number of samples.
The first two analyses showed good correlation and translation from
microarrays to BBMA for both IgG and IgM anti-GPIs antibody detection
and the possibility to quantify the immunoreactivity of the GPI-conjugates
against established standards, which is required for proper standardization
of the method.6 Antibody detection was
performed using the full glycan of the LMWA (GPI1). Previously,
we showed the detection of anti-GPI antibodies on microarrays using
fragments of GPI1 with similar specificity as with the
full glycan.16 These smaller fragments
represent an alternative to GPI1 to use defined material
with reduced complexity and production cost of the antigen without
loss of specificity and selectivity in the assay.

The detection
of anti-GPI1 IgM and IgG antibodies
in sera from acute infected patients showed the induction of these
antibodies at the initial stage of the infection.34 However, the detection of IgG serostatus by BBMA of >80
sera using GPI1 presented a lower correlation with the
commercial ELISA test than BBMA using SAG1 as antigen. The correlation
difference could derive from the sole usage of SAG1, which is the
main immunogenic protein on the surface of tachyzoites31 and a low abundance or absence of the LMWA in
the detergent extract of purified T. gondii parasites
used as antigen in the commercial ELISA test.

The detection
of antiglycan antibodies in ovarian cancer patients
by three glycan immunoassays (ELISA, printed glycan array, and BBMA
assay) has shown variable detection specificities that are influenced
by factors such as density, surface presentation of glycans, and antibody/antigen
ratios for each assay format.41 Therefore,
each assay format has its own advantages and disadvantages. BBMA is
suitable for diagnostic purposes in clinical settings, illustrated
by the recently introduced commercial multiplex assay for the detection
of IgM antibodies against T. gondii, rubella, and
cytomegalovirus (ToRC)42−44 or for large-scale epidemiological surveys.10,45 We illustrate that the GPI1 glycan antigen works independently
of the type of assay used and can be applied for the detection of
both IgG and IgM antibodies, which might be a valuable addition to
established commercial assays. Further studies should determine the
reactivity of IgA and IgE antibodies, and the avidity of IgG antibodies
toward GPIs, which may extend the applicability of this antigen to
confirm an acute infection also in other assay formats. Moreover,
the possibility of discrimination of very early from later infections
by using SAG1 and GPI1 as antigens and combined
with IgM serology needs to be substantiated with sera from a larger
panel and also from different patient cohorts (immunocompromised patients,
newborns from seropositive mothers, follow-up sera from the same seroconverters,
etc.).

Conclusion
Synthetic glycan antigen GPI1 from T. gondii was conjugated to maleimide-modified
carboxylate-beads to determine
the anti-T. gondii serostatus using a bead-based
multiplex assay. GPI1 was only slightly less sensitive
and specific in detecting IgG antibodies in human sera than the protein
antigen SAG1. However, GPI1 was better than SAG1 in detecting
the IgM immune response during an early acute infection. Therefore,
GPI1 is an attractive candidate antigen to be included
in multiplex bead-based assays for the early detection of a T. gondii infection.
