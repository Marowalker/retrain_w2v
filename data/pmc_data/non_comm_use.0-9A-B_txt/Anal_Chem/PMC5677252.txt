Direct
analysis by mass spectrometry (imaging) has become increasingly
deployed in preclinical and clinical research due to its rapid and
accurate readouts. However, when it comes to biomarker discovery or
histopathological diagnostics, more sensitive and in-depth profiling
from localized areas is required. We developed a comprehensive, fully
automated online platform for high-resolution liquid extraction surface
analysis (HR-LESA) followed by micro–liquid chromatography
(LC) separation and a data-independent acquisition strategy for untargeted
and low abundant analyte identification directly from tissue sections.
Applied to tissue sections of rat pituitary, the platform demonstrated
improved spatial resolution, allowing sample areas as small as 400
μm to be studied, a major advantage over conventional LESA.
The platform integrates an online buffer exchange and washing step
for removal of salts and other endogenous contamination that originates
from local tissue extraction. Our carry over–free platform
showed high reproducibility, with an interextraction variability below
30%. Another strength of the platform is the additional selectivity
provided by a postsampling gas-phase ion mobility separation. This
allowed distinguishing coeluted isobaric compounds without requiring
additional separation time. Furthermore, we identified untargeted
and low-abundance analytes, including neuropeptides deriving from
the pro-opiomelanocortin precursor protein and localized a specific
area of the pituitary gland (i.e., adenohypophysis) known to secrete
neuropeptides and other small metabolites related to development,
growth, and metabolism. This platform can thus be applied for the
in-depth study of small samples of complex tissues with histologic
features of ∼400 μm or more, including potential neuropeptide
markers involved in many diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases,
obesity, bulimia, and anorexia nervosa.

Mass spectrometry
imaging (MSI)
is being used more often in preclinical and clinical research due
to its many advantages over conventional imaging techniques.1−3 MSI offers the possibility to correlate distribution maps of multiple
molecular species simultaneously with histological and clinical features
without labeling. This methodology enables the discovery of potential
diagnostic and prognostic markers of diseases in a single experiment.
With these unique features, MSI opens new doors for molecular-driven
pathology, in various fields of histopathological diagnostics, such
as identification and grading of tumors.4,5 MSI has also
proven to be a powerful tool in drug discovery as it gives insights
not only on drug and metabolite distribution and site(s) of action
but also about the biology present at the sites of drug localization
relating to treatment efficacy.6

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) is by far the
most popular ionization technique used to map the tissue microenvironment.
In this way, molecular classification can be accurately established
with different tissue types, including tumors, to improve the accuracy
of diagnosis and characterize tumor heterogeneity.7 MALDI-MSI allows in situ tissue characterization at different
molecular “omics” levels—metabolomics, lipidomics,
peptidomics, and proteomics8—and
has found numerous clinical applications, including oncology,9 psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders,10−12 cardiovascular diseases,13,14 ophthalmology,15 and joint and cartilage-related disorders.16 Extensive efforts focused on instrument development
to improve spatial resolution, throughput, and sensitivity have placed
MALDI-MSI in a competitive position for clinical studies where knowledge
about the tumor microenvironment is critical and hundreds of samples
require analysis.17−19 One of the drawbacks of MALDI-MSI is the need for
the application of homogeneous layers of MALDI matrix on the tissue
surface and the ion suppression resulting from the extraction process.
This is in part due to the lack of separation technology in an imaging
experiment and can degrade the sensitivity and quality of data generated.

Recently, ambient ionization techniques have proven their suitability
to extract relevant information from complex biological matrices.20 The main benefit of these techniques is the
possibility to analyze directly surfaces with relatively less complex
and time-consuming sample preparation compared to MALDI. This considerably
reduces sample handling and speeds up the whole analytical workflow.
Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI)21,22 is increasing its application in clinical research as it provides
relatively fast, sensitive, and complementary analysis to MALDI-MSI.23−29 DESI allows rapid classification of human tumors based on tissue-specific
lipid molecular profiling.30 One of the
most promising applications would be to use the information at the
time of surgery on resected specimens to guide surgical resections
that could improve management of patients.31 Liquid extraction surface analysis (LESA), based on a liquid microjunction
(LMJ) surface sampling, was introduced in 2008 and has been employed
for profiling biological matrices from localized tissue area in various
studies, including drug distribution and metabolism,32−36 microbiology,37 small molecule antibody–drug
conjugate catabolites,38 lipidomics,32,39 proteomics,40−42 and native mass spectrometry for nonconvalent complex
studies.43,44 Although often criticized for the poor spatial
resolution achievable (i.e., 1.2–2.0 mm with 1 μL of
solvent deposited on the top of the surface), LESA is an excellent
tool for conducting profiling experiments from a selected spot, such
as quick metabolite screening or parent drug localization to an organ.
Complementary to quantitative whole-body autoradiography that provides
distribution information on radiolabeled material, LESA followed by
MS detection enables differentiation of a parent drug from its metabolites.

Chromatography-free approaches create ionization suppression effects,
which enables the identification of analytes of high abundance45 but limits protein/peptide identification because
of the high degree of cell or tissue complexity. Frequently, compounds
are codesorbed; to deal with structural isomers and/or isobaric compounds
(e.g., interfering isotopic clusters), chromatography-free approaches
often suffer from the absence of separation before the mass analysis.
Indeed, high resolution is not adequate to distinguish isomers and
in some cases tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) does not provide enough
selectivity. Therefore, additional information and improved selectivity
are required to provide adequate identification of biologically relevant
analytes. The addition of a postdesorption and postionization gas-phase
ion mobility separation (IMS) after MALDI, DESI, and LESA has demonstrated
to resolve isobaric species and reduce chemical noise.29,34,46 However, this method does not
account for tissue-specific ionization suppression.45 Because the surface sampling and the ionization processes
are resolved both in space and time dimensions, LESA allows for the
manipulation of the extracted material in the liquid phase prior to
ionization of molecular content.47 As a
consequence, LESA can easily incorporate a liquid-based separation
after the surface sampling process, which is not possible with MALDI
or DESI ionization techniques. Kertesz et al. developed a LMJ-SS approach
followed by HPLC-ESI-MS for the analysis of drugs and metabolites
in whole-body thin tissue sections, which helps to distinguish isomeric
phase II metabolites of propanolol.48 Continuous-flow
LMJ-SS coupled online with HPLC/MS also enables the extraction, separation,
and detection of proteins and low-molecular-weight compounds (e.g.,
drugs of abuse) from tissue sections and dried blood spots. Usually,
the surface of dried blood spots is sufficiently hydrophobic for maintaining
a stable liquid junction, even with high-aqueous-content solvents.49 This innovative LMJ-SS-HPLC-MS/MS approach was
also used to investigate the distribution of specific markers within
normal human pituitary gland and pituitary adenoma tissue sections,
to discriminate between tumor and nontumor tissues.50 However, such a targeted approach requires sample cleanup
prior to analysis and will not allow broad screening for potential
biomarkers.

In the present work, we describe a platform developed
to improve
both poor spatial resolution achieved with “conventional”
LESA and ionization suppression effect. The platform was modified
for high-resolution (HR)-LESA for direct analysis of endogenous peptides
from a 400-μm area from preclinical tissue samples.51 The HR-LESA was integrated with an online washing
step to remove salts and other contaminants, the key source of ion
suppression. Micro-LC (μLC) was used to separate the analytes
of interest from endogenous sample matrix compounds, an additional
source of ion suppression. This platform allows isomeric separation
due to the implementation of μLC further improved by ion mobility.
After this μLC separation, the compounds were analyzed by MS,
which combines IMS with high-definition (HD) MSE, a data-independent
acquisition method. Finally, we automated the entire HR-LESA-μLC-HDMSE platform by implementing new software. This platform is presented
here as a complementary addition to the field of mass spectrometry
imaging since it opens doors to a more in-depth profiling of spatial
extractions of biological tissues.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
and Reagents
ULC/MS-grade water, ULC/MS-grade
acetonitrile (ACN), and 99% formic acid were purchased from Biosolve
(Valkenswaard, NL). Microscopic glass slides were purchased from Thermo
Scientific (Braunschweig, DE). Leucine enkephalin standard was provided
by a Waters Q-ToF Qualification Standards Kit (Etten-Leur, NL) and
prepared at a concentration of 5 ng/μL in ACN/water (50/50; v/v) and used as lock mass.

Murine Tissue
Sectioning
Healthy Wistar Han rat pituitary
gland tissue samples were provided by the Department of General Surgery
of the Maastricht University Medical Center (MUMC+). The fresh-frozen
wild type and transgenic APP KM670/671NL/PS1L166P mice were supplied by the Bio-Imaging Lab, University of Antwerp.
Tissues were cryo-sectioned (Microtome cryostat Thermo Scientific,
Braunschweig, DE) into 12-μm-thick tissue sections and subsequently
thaw-mounted on regular microscope glass slides. These tissue sections
were stored at −80 °C prior to analysis. Right before
the analysis, samples were thawed at room temperature and desiccated
for 30 min. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed
on these tissue samples after HR-LESA-μLC-MS analysis.

H&E
Staining Protocol
H&E staining was performed
on the same sections used for HR-LESA-μLC-HDMSE experiments.
After MSI analysis, the residual matrix was gently removed by dipping
the glass slides in ethanol for 2 min. Sections were then washed in
successive baths (96% EtOH, 70% EtOH, and deionized water, 3 min each).
The hematoxylin (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) staining was then performed
for 3 min, and slides were then washed in gently running tap water
for 3 min, followed by eosin staining for 30 s, washing under running
tap water for 1 min, and finally immersing in 100% EtOH for 2 min.
Slides were finally dehydrated in xylene (30 s), covered in Etallen,
and coverslipped. The optical images were acquired using a MIRAX Desk
scanner (Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany). Images were acquired with a magnification
of 40.

Conventional LESA Extraction
The LESA extraction was
performed using the automated TriVersa NanoMate Advion robot (Advion,
Ithaca, NY). A 0.5-μL volume of the extraction solvent (ACN/water/formic
acid, 70/30/0.1 v/v/v) was deposited with a conductive pipet tip onto the tissue section
for 5 s repeated 1 times. This extract was directly infused into the
mass spectrometer (Waters Synapt G2-Si, USA) using chip-based nano-ESI,
by applying a nitrogen gas pressure of 0.3 bar and voltage of 1.40
kV.

HR-LESA Extraction, Online Washing, and μLC Separation
High spatial resolution extraction was performed using the capillary
extraction arm usually used for coupling with LC-MS fraction collection.
Extraction with this setup was performed with 0.5 μL of extraction
solvent (ACN/water/formic acid, 70/30/0.1 v/v/v) after 5 s in contact with the tissue
section. An online and automated buffer exchange was then performed,
by diluting 10 times the sample with the carrier solvent (ACN/water/formic
acid, 5/95/0.1 v/v/v), to ensure compatibility with reversed-phase chromatography, and
collected in a 3-μL loop (Figure 1). Under these conditions, the local extraction was
achieved at a spatial resolution of 400 μm, and the total workflow
from the extraction solvent aspiration to filling in the sample loop
takes ∼3 min.

elements
of the μLC system (in gray) and the automated sampler device

green. The route of the sample loop is shown in red. The 6-port valve
is in the “sample loading” position. HR: high spatial
resolution. LESA: liquid extraction surface analysis. BSM: binary

Following this extraction,
the sample was trapped onto a trap column
(ACQUITY UPLC M-class Symmetry C18, 100 Å, 5 μm, 300 μm
× 50 mm, Waters, City, ST) and washed with the carrier solvent
for 2 min to remove salts and other possible interferences/contamination.
After the 2 min online washing, the trap column was back-flushed onto
the μLC IonKey column (iKey BEH C18 Separation Device, 130 Å,
1.7 μm, 150 μm × 50 mm, Waters, Milford, MA) for
chromatographic separation as follow: a 13 min gradient from 1% to
85% solvent B (ACN/formic acid, 100/0.1) was used for elution of peptides.
The column was washed for 3 min at 85% solvent B prior to the column
equilibration at 1% solvent B for 5 min. The trap column was equilibrated
at 1% solvent B for 4 min.

Mass Spectrometry
All MS experiments
were conducted
on a Waters Synapt G2-Si system operated in positive ionization mode
(in sensitivity mode). General operating parameters were as follows:
capillary voltage = 4 kV; source temperature = 80 °C; sampling
cone voltage = 40 V; and a desolvation temperature = 150 °C.
The default collision energy was set at 4 eV in full MS scan mode.
IMS was performed using nitrogen as a drift gas at a flow rate of
90 mL/min. The TRAP DC entrance was set to 0 V, and the wave height
was set to 40 V. The velocity of the IMS wave was used to separate
the ions over the total 200 ms. The start velocity was set at 1200
m/s and the end velocity at 400 m/s. Data-independent HDMSE acquisition was conducted for the analysis of the pituitary gland
and further identification of extracted endogenous peptides. These
measurements were performed in the TRANSFER T-wave using a collision
energy ramp from 20 to 45 eV. The detector voltage was set at 2500
V, and data was acquired within a mass range of m/z 50–2000.

Software
The LESA
extraction was controlled by a beta
version of the LESA Plus software (Advion, UK), and MassLynx 1.4 (Waters,
U.S.A.) was used for controlling the online washing step and the μLC
separation. Data were processed and visualized using Mass Lynx 1.4
(Waters, U.S.A.) and DriftScope v2.5 (Waters, U.S.A.). The identification
of the neuropeptides and proteins was performed using Progenesis QI
for proteomics v2.0.5556.29015 (Non Linear Dynamics, U.S.A.). For
this identification, a species-specific FASTA file was created, and
a nonspecific digest reagent was selected. The amount of missed cleavages
was set at three, and the post-translational modifications (PTMs)
allowed in this MSE search were N-acetylation, M-oxidation,
and C-carbamidomethylation.

Results and Discussion
Here, we describe the HR-LESA-μLC-MS platform and its performance
for spatial analysis of neuropeptides. For this purpose, two animal
models were used. The first experiments rely on the investigation
of neuropeptides in rat pituitary gland tissues, which consists of
two different regions with different biological functionalities: the
adenohypophysis (anterior lobe and intermediate lobe) and the neurohypophysis
(posterior lobe). Therefore, due to the morphology of the tissue (∼2
× 3 mm), local extraction at high spatial resolution is crucial
for molecular characterization of both regions. The second set of
experiments is performed on wild type and transgenic mice expressing
amyloidosis to assess the potential of the platform to study neuropeptides
potentially involved in Alzheimer’s disease progression. In
this case, the sampling areas include regions with high expression
of amyloidosis, such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum,
which also require precise sampling.

Analytical Platform
Spatial
Resolution
In a conventional LESA setup, the
extraction is achieved using a conductive pipet tip–which,
depending on the solvent composition, can lead to a large sampled
area up to 2 mm.52 This is potentially
a limiting factor when analyzing small objects such as the anatomical
features of the pituitary gland or any other organs that require precise
sampling. In our HR-LESA-μLC-MS platform (Figure 1), we modified the extraction system to improve
the spatial resolution and reduce the size of the extracted areas.
By using a silica capillary instead, we were able to significantly
improve the spatial resolution to 400 μm, as assessed under
microscopic evaluation of the tissue section after the liquid extraction
took place (Figure 2). With an extracted area of 400 μm, the molecular content
from the anterior and posterior lobe of the pituitary gland can be
accurately extracted. We illustrate the ability to unambiguously distinguish
between the adenohypophysis and neurohypophysis of the pituitary in Figure 2. Equal spot sizes
were observed from the mouse brain tissue section in the H&E image
after HR-LESA-μLC-HDMSE (Figure S-1).

and after

HR-LESA (i.e., 400 μm area represented by a green dot in b)
compared to conventional LESA (area shows the spot size of a typical

lobe; 2. posterior lobe; 3. intermediate lobe.

Reproducibility of the Extraction
To investigate the
extraction reproducibility and sample carry-over of the HR-LESA setup,
extraction of a leucine enkephalin standard was performed followed
by flow injection analysis. A 5-ng leucine enkephalin solution (prepared
in ACN/H2O; 50/50; v/v) was spotted onto a hydrophobic
plate and air-dried. The extractions of five consecutive spots using
0.9 μL of 50% ACN + 0.1% HCOOH and the modified HR-LESA extraction
system resulted in a coefficient of variation of 30% (based on the
surface area from the extracted ion chromatogram at m/z 556.28 (protonated species [LeuEnk + H]+) for each extracted spots; n = 5; Figure S-2).

Integration of Online Clean up between Extraction
and Chromatographic
Separation
The tissue sample was placed in the sample plate
holder as shown in the photograph in Figure 1. This tissue extract was then collected
in a 384-well plate and diluted with carrier solvent. The diluted
extract was “injected” by the same fused silica capillary,
collected in the 3-μL loop, and, after switching the 6-port
valve, trapped onto the C18 trap column for an online washing
with water/ACN (99/1; v/v) to remove
all water-soluble matrix compounds. The trap column was back-flushed
to separate the remaining sample on an Ionkey separation device using
a reversed phase μLC separation.

Reproducibility of the
Chromatographic Separation and Sample
Carry-Over
HR-LESA combined with the online washing and μLC
separation IonKey system was evaluated. The chromatographic peak of
leucine enkephalin was found at a retention time of 16 min. This extraction
was performed in triplicate to test the retention time reproducibility
followed by two blank extractions to study carry-over. The relative
standard deviation of the retention time was <0.12% and the carry-over
in the first blank extraction was <1.1% using the absolute peak
area, which demonstrates a good reproducibility of chromatographic
separation (Figure S-3). The minimal occurrence
of sample carry-over was due to the online cleanup of the sample loop
during the analysis. In addition to the leucine enkephalin standard
extraction, reproducibility of the chromatographic separation of neuropeptides
from mouse brain and corresponding carry-over has been investigated.
Relative standard deviation values vary from 7.1% to 25.4%, and the
sample carry-over is <0.8% (Figures S-4, S-5, and S-6). These values were obtained from three tissue extractions
followed by a blank extraction in use of the absolute chromatographic
peak area. While the implementation of μLC into our platform
significantly minimizes the amount of ionization suppression, the
reproducibility could be considerably improved by the addition of
an isotope-labeled internal standard to the tissue sample.

Postsurface Sampling Chromatographic Separation
Having
demonstrated that the HR-LESA provided higher spatial resolution,
good reproducibility, and minimal sample carry-over, we implemented
a μLC separation to enable isomeric separation and further sample
cleanup. Isomers have the same mass and the same molecular formula,
in contrast to isobaric compounds, which have the same nominal mass
but differ in molecular formula. MS alone is insufficient to separate
and accurately identify isomeric compounds (even with high mass resolution
instrumention). Furthermore, ion suppression often occurs and is considered
the primary cause of irreproducibility in MS. Because LC is a powerful
tool for separation of these isomeric compounds,52 we integrated an online washing step and μLC separation
after the surface sampling and prior to electrospray ionization (Figure 1). Compared to conventional
LESA, the HR-LESA approach with online washing and μLC separation
showed an increase in sensitivity and selectivity for leucine enkephalin
in the adenohypophysis region of rat pituitary online (Figure 3). When we performed our HR-LESA-μLC-HDMSE approach for the analysis of pituitary, 67 compounds could
be chemically identified, while out of this list (Table S-2) only five and four compounds could be found in
the conventional LESA-HDMS and LESA-MS data, respectively. For the
mouse brain cerebral cortex analysis, 14 compounds could be identified
with HR-LESA-μLC-HDMSE, while out of this list (Table S-4) only three and two compounds were
observed in the conventional LESA-HDMS and LESA-MS data, respectively.
In view of the even larger spot size of LESA-MS, the minimization
of ionization suppression by μLC is crucial for detection of
lower abundant compounds. Although the implementation of μLC
in our approach requires a longer analysis time (30 min/spot) compared
to conventional LESA-MS (1 min/spot), this can be justified due to
the enhanced detection limits of the HR-LESA-μLC-HDMSE platform compared to conventional LESA-HDMS and LESA-MS.

Figure 3 Sensitivity
of LESA-MS versus HR-LESA-μLC-MS: The total mass
spectrum (a and c) and a zoomed-in mass spectrum (b and d) of the
adenohypophysis region of rat pituitary gland using LESA-MS (a and
b) compared to HR-LESA-μLC-MS (c and d). The zoomed mass range
displays a low-intensity peak corresponding to the protonated molecule
of leucine enkephalin (marked with *), which is known to be present
in this region. This is extracted from the ion chromatogram at a retention
time at 16 min. The zoomed mass range from HR-LESA-μLC-MS shows
the presence of leucine enkephalin coeluting with a triply charged
species, which was not observed with LESA-MS.

Interestingly, in the pituitary gland data, we observed the
presence
of a triply charged species (Figure 3d) coeluting with the leucine enkephalin, which was
not detected with the conventional LESA extraction (Figure 3b). This difference can be
explained by the occurrence of ion suppression, which was minimized
by HR-LESA-μLC-MS. The extracted ion chromatogram (XIC) based
on the protonated molecule signal of leucine enkephalin (m/z 556.28 ± 0.05) extracted from the adenohypophysis
region showed a retention time of 16 min, similar to that of the monoisotopic
peak of the triply charged species (m/z 555.65, Figure 4a).

Figure 4 Extraction
of two coeluting compounds: the XIC (a) and corresponding
mass spectra (b). The green XIC represents the chromatogram extracted
from the monoisotopic peak of the triply charged species at m/z 555.65. The red XIC represents the
chromatogram extracted from leucine enkephalin at m/z 556.28.

However, the corresponding mass spectrum shows a different
isotope
pattern belonging to a triply charged species (Figure 4b, green asterisk). This clearly exposes
the limitations of LC separation and the need for additional separation
power to increase selectivity and accurate identification. For this
reason, an additional gas-phase IMS was added to the analytical workflow
to increase the analytical content of the data.

Ion Mobility
Separation (IMS) of Isobaric Species
We
employed triwave ion mobility to achieve additional separation: the
TRAP T-Wave region was used for trapping and accumulating ions, IMS
T-Wave region for subsequent separation, and the TRANSFER T-Wave region
to focus the ions and also as fragmentation cell when performing data-independent
HDMSE measurements.

IMS was performed from the anterior
lobe HR-LESA extraction (m/z 556.28 eluting at tR = 16 min; Figure 5a). The extracted ion mobility drift time
spectrum (Figure 5b)
depicts two drift time peaks, which can be labeled using the corresponding
mass spectra as leucine enkephalin (Figure 5d) and its coeluting compound (Figure 5c). The mass spectra extracted
at this specific retention time displayed clean signals with overall
improved sensitivity. The observed isotope pattern of the triply charged
species has a mass of 1664 Da after deconvolution. The advantage of
the integration of IMS after chromatographic separation is the additional
separation power that is gained to separate coeluting isomeric species,
without compromising the overall analysis time. For the identification
of this coeluting species and other extracted proteins (Figure S-7), HDMSE analysis was performed.
HDMSE is a data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode that
includes both high and low collision energy measurements alternated
in one parallel analysis using the retention time to match precursor
and product ions. Species can be identified in one analysis without
requiring additional data-dependent MS/MS experiments by performing
HDMSE analysis.

Figure 5 Ion mobilogram (a) of the extract from the anterior
lobe of pituitary
gland is depicted. The extracted ion mobility drift time spectrum
(b) shows the separation of two coeluting compounds. The extracted
mass spectra at drift time 3.8 (c) and 5.6 ms (d) show the separation
of both compounds, indicated in red (leucine encephalin) and green
(N-acetylated alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone).

Identification of Neuropeptides and Proteins
Present in the
Pituitary Gland
We sought to identify neuropeptides and proteins
in the rat pituitary samples using our platform by integrating data-independent
acquisition (DIA). We chose the DIA approach because data-dependent
acquisition (DDA) often neglects low-abundance precursor ions, which
limits the discovery of untargeted analytes and markers.53

One DIA approach, MSE, collects
TOF mass spectra with and without fragmentation by alternating the
energy of the collision cell between low and high values.53 Another approach, sequential window acquisition
of all theoretical fragment-ion spectra (SWATH), was developed on
hybrid QqTOF mass analyzers that offer resolving power of 20 000–40 000.54 Both approaches were demonstrated to be particularly
powerful in detecting low-abundance analytes for further metabolite
and peptide identifications. We integrated high-definition MSE (HDMSE) acquisition, including ion mobility separation,
into our platform.

HDMSE detects both precursor ions
and fragments of the
precursor ions fragmented independently on their abundance.55 Progenesis QI for proteomics software uses an
algorithm that also performs a database search considering retention
time, mass accuracy, and PTMs.53 However,
due to the DIA nature of these analyses, this algorithm is based on
physicochemical properties of the peptides and proteins. These characteristics
are used to calculate the correlation to models with regards to hydrophobicity
and gas-phase separation and are, therefore, applicable to reversed-phase
LC and IMS. In similar strategy to DDA to calculate false-positive
identification rates, we applied decoy and species-specific databases.
Sensitivity and selectivity are significantly increased because of
the repetitive approach of this algorithm. After the identification
of the most abundant protein, this data is removed from the database,
and another search is executed to identify the second most abundant
protein. After removing the data from the second most abundant protein,
a third search is performed. This process is continued until all proteins
are identified.

In the extracts from the rat pituitary gland,
we identified vasopressin
and POMC (Figure S-8), based on 17 and
25 peptides, respectively (Tables S-1; Table S-2 lists the peptides found).53 These peptides,
which are deriving from the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) precursor
protein, are important signaling molecules with regard to feeding
behavior and, therefore, involved in diseases like obesity, bulimia,
and anorexia nervosa.56,57 In the mouse brain cerebral cortex
extracts, we identified 14 peptides (Table S-3; Table S-4 lists the peptides found).

After applying de
novo peptide sequencing to the fragmentation
spectrum of the coeluting species at m/z 1664 at the retention time of 16 min, this compound was identified
as N-acetylated alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone based on nine
fragment ions: y1, b1, y2, y7+2, y5, y10+2, y12+2, y7, and y8, deriving from P01194
(124–136). The MS/MS spectrum can be found in the Supporting Information (Figure S-9). Based on
the MSE data, the singly charged species was identified
as leucine enkephalin (Figure S-10).

Conclusion
This work reports the development of an automated
and integrated
platform combining the advantages of both spatial sampling with LESA
and chromatographic separation (μLC) for the direct analysis
of tissue sections with potential clinical, preclinical relevance
(Figure 1). In addition,
the platform was strengthened by the integration of ion mobility spectrometry
(IMS) and data-independent acquisition (DIA) for both the separation
and the identification of neuropeptides from a complex tissue extract
from a 400-μm area. Improvement over the “conventional
LESA” of the spatial resolution capabilities of the surface-sampling
process was achieved, down to a spatial resolution of 400 μm,
by modifying the sampling probe (Figure 2). The platform demonstrated strong reproducibility,
minimal carry-over, increased sensitivity, technical reproducibility,
and identification of isobaric compounds (Figures 3–5).

The advantages of this integrated platform hold strong potential
for preclinical and clinical applications. Currently, the extraction
efficacy is limited to soluble proteins with the number of protein
and peptide identifications at fewer than 500. In particular, low-abundance
analytes can be identified in complex and small tissue samples, as
demonstrated with rat pituitary and mouse brain here. Information
about protein isoforms, important in many neurodegenerative diseases,
is predicted to be elucidated with the application of our platform
with classical in-gel proteomics.42 This
approach paves the way for imaging researchers to increase the total
number of proteins and peptides identified and enable regional quantification-based
on-tissue analysis.
